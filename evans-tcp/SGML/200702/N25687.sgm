<HEAD>CAROLINE OF LICHTFIELD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not Lichtfield in England, but Litchfield, a &s;uppo&s;ed Pru&s;&s;ian title.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THE Baron of Lichtfield was High Chamberlain and Mini&s;ter of State to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. "Caro|line," &s;aid he to his daughter, as they one day &s;at at break|fa&s;t, "tell me, (the Baron had an in&s;inuating &s;mile as he &s;poke, with &s;omewhat of penetration in his look) tell me, dear Caroline, is thy heart free?"</P>
<P>"Sir!"</P>
<P>Caroline did not immediately comprehend his meaning.</P>
<P>"It is two months &s;ince I brought thee to court, from the retreat in which thou had&s;t been educated; and ha&s;t thou &s;een nobody in that &s;hort &s;pace, no young courtier, to whom thy heart would give a preference?"</P>
<P>Caroline was but &s;ixteen, and the que&s;tion was of that kind that u&s;ually embarra&s;&s;es, when addre&s;&s;ed to a virgin of &s;ixteen. Caroline, however, might reply without dread or he&s;itation. Her young bo&s;om, as pure and tran|quil as in the &s;erene and jocund days of infancy, had ne|ver &s;ighed, except for plea&s;ures innocent and pure as it|&s;elf. A new blown ro&s;e, a favorite bullfinch, or a fairy tale, had, hitherto, been the general limits of her hopes and fears. The&s;e plea&s;ures, indeed, &s;ince &s;he had come to court, had been &s;omewhat &s;uper&s;eded by a ball, a con|cert, or a new-fa&s;hioned cap; but that man might influ|ence the happine&s;s of her life had never yet entered her imagination. Tho&s;e who were the be&s;t and mo&s;t inde|fatigable dancers, certainly, gave her the greate&s;t &s;atisfac|tion, while at an a&s;&s;embly; but, the ball over, Caroline could &s;weetly &s;leep twelve hours together, awake with a &s;ong, and prepare for a new appointment, without think|ing of the partner with whom &s;he la&s;t had danced.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="034126_0003_0FFA551BB9A90068"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erefore rather &s;urpri&s;ed than confu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a &s;hort &s;ilence, &s;he replied, "Your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> very &s;ingular!"</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> natural, my dear," &s;aid the Baron: "and moreover, I will endeavour to &s;hew you it is likewi&s;e very important. Li&s;ten to me &s;eriou&s;ly, Caroline," con|tinued he, drawing his chair clo&s;er to hers, and tenderly cla&s;ping her hand. "You have the misfortune to be the only daughter of the High Chamberlain of Pru&s;&s;ia, and heire&s;s to twenty-five thou&s;and crowns a year."</P>
<P>The mixture of irony and &s;atisfaction vi&s;ible in his countenance, though un&s;een by Caroline, while rehear&s;|ing his titles and e&s;tate, proved, too powerfully, that the&s;e his misfortunes were his &s;upreme plea&s;ures. But it was nece&s;&s;ary to his pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;ume a philo&s;ophic, a di&s;intere&s;ted, and a &s;entimental air, thereby to in&s;pire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and, by affecting the pa&s;&s;ions, to read the heart, and induce obedience. This was the more ea&s;y for him to ef|fect, in that he was not only perfectly a courtier, but had a degree of natural eloquence, which &s;upplied the want of a &s;ound under&s;tanding, or a feeling heart. Be&s;ides, it is not ea&s;y, at &s;ixteen, to di&s;cover the face of hone&s;ty from the ma&s;k, e&s;pecially when a father &s;peaks.</P>
<P>The word misfortune, however, had &s;omewhat &s;urpri|&s;ed Caroline; who, thinking &s;he perhaps had mi&s;under|&s;tood, repeated, &s;miling, "Misfortune, papa!"</P>
<P>"Yes, misfortune, my child," replied the Baron&punc; ap|parently affected. "I &s;ee, with plea&s;ure, you know not as yet all the con&s;equences of the&s;e &s;eeming ble&s;&s;ings, for this informs me you &s;till remain &s;uch as I could wi&s;h you to be."</P>
<P>A thou&s;and confu&s;ed ideas were cro&s;&s;ing and combating one another in the mind of Caroline. Misfortune and her&s;elf had never before been united in her imagination: the idea for a moment made her melancholy, and &s;he &s;tood with downca&s;t eyes, uncon&s;ciou&s;ly plucking the leaves of a ro&s;e, which &s;he held in her white and virgin hand.</P>
<P>"Yes, my dear daughter," &s;aid the Baron, ri&s;ing, and gravely walking the room, "it is often one of our greate&s;t misfortunes to be born of noble parents, and to be po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of va&s;t domains. The chain, I ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is gilt, but is not the le&s;s heavy, or the le&s;s a chain. (The Baron was charmed to hear his own wit.) "Yet I hope," added he,
<PB N="5" REF="034126_0004_0FFA1BAE0A28F7A8">
a&s;&s;uming a cheerful &s;mile of benig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, "I hope, my Ca|roline, the chains that thou &s;halt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear &s;hall hang lightly, and be ever worn with grace and plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>The Baron pau&s;ed, and Caroline looked up, vainly en|deavouring to comprehend to what this his preface tend|ed. He continued:</P>
<P>"My dear girl, the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart has ever been thy felicity. Long have I fore&s;een (the Baron &s;ighed, but the Baron was a courtier), long feared, that not on me, but on a Monarch, who&s;e power is ab&s;olute, and mu&s;t not be controverted, thy de&s;tiny would depend &mdash; No, not on a tender father! To avoid, therefore, heaping on thee the di&s;tre&s;s, the torment, of combating affections which may not be con&s;ulted, ever &s;ince the death of thy mother I have committed thy education to a friend, who&s;e care and retired &s;ituation have pre&s;erved thy heart free. I have &s;acrificed the &s;weet plea&s;ure of living with my child, of &s;uperintending her education, and being my&s;elf delighted with her progre&s;s, to her future happine&s;s; and if I have &s;ecured this happine&s;s, my &s;elf-denial will be more than repa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d."</P>
<P>"Ah, my dear dear father!" cried Caroline, ki&s;&s;ing the Baron's hand, which &s;he moi&s;tened with her tears, unable to expre&s;s her &s;en&s;ations. Somewhat &s;he would have added, but he interrupted her.</P>
<P>"The moment is arrived, my daughter, in which the &s;ucce&s;s of all my precautions mu&s;t be a&s;certained. Two months &s;ince (thou we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t then at Rindaw) the King told me he &s;hould with plea&s;ure behold thee united to the Count of Wal&s;tein, his known favorite, and his pre&s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to Peter&s;burgh. Notwith&s;tanding that this marriage might even exceed the utmo&s;t wi&s;hes of a fa|ther, I alleged thy great youth, in hopes to &s;ee the ce|remony deferred, and longer to enjoy thy company, longer to behold thee a part of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"The King replied, thy &s;ociety I might and &s;hould enjoy as &s;oon as thou wert married. Caroline, &s;aid he, mu&s;t now be &s;ixteen; it is time &s;he &s;hould come to adorn my court, and make my Wal&s;tein happy. He will re|turn immediately from his emba&s;&s;y; &s;end, therefore, for your daughter, and the nuptials &s;hall as immediately take place.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="034126_0005_0FFA552D33C839C0">"I could make no reply to a command &s;o preci&s;e; and, is thou knowe&s;t, I directly came and brought thee hither. But &s;carcely had we returned before I learnt the Count was fallen dangerou&s;ly ill on the road, and that his arrival and our intents were, for a while &s;u&s;|pended. I, therefore, thought it u&s;ele&s;s to &s;peak to thee of a marriage which, perhaps, might never take place; and I was willing to &s;ee thee enjoy, for a moment, the &s;weet illu&s;ions of youth. Ye&s;terday evening, how|ever, the Count returned, recovered from his illne&s;s, and the King &s;ent in&s;tantly for me, pre&s;ented my future &s;on-in-law, and bade me prepare for this marriage with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed. Thou &s;ee&s;t I could no longer delay to inform thee of the will of my &s;overeign: thou &s;ee&s;t, my child, thy de&s;tiny is fixed. My fear was that, during the two months thou ha&s;t been at court, thy young heart might, unfortunately, have &s;elected &s;ome one of the youths thou ha&s;t &s;een there. Thus, what &s;hould have been thy happine&s;s would then, have been thy mi&s;ery; but I &s;ee, with tran&s;port, thy heart is yet untouched; thy pre&s;ent &s;implicity and innocence are certain proofs, and my Caroline may now comply, may give me her pro|mi&s;e, that &s;he will willingly become the Counte&s;s of Wal|&s;tein, and the Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. Wilt thou not, my Caroline? Wilt thou not, my child?"</P>
<P>The&s;e fine titles, emphatically dwelt on, dazzled the young fancy of Caroline. A&s;toni&s;hed, taken by &s;urpri&s;e, and conceiving nothing &s;o wonderful and &s;o charming as all at once to become an Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s, and a Counte&s;s, &s;he rai&s;ed her charming blue eyes, and looking at her fa|ther, while they &s;parkled with plea&s;ure&mdash;</P>
<P>"What," &s;aid &s;he, in the &s;implicity of her heart, "&s;hall I be all that, papa? Indeed I am exceedingly glad to hear it!"</P>
<P>Her natural good &s;en&s;e, for &s;he had abundance, immedi|ately reproved her: &s;he felt &s;he had rather &s;poken from the fulne&s;s of her heart than from prudent reflection; again her eyes were ca&s;t down, and the blood ro&s;e blu&s;h|ing to her cheeks, till they re&s;embled the ro&s;e leaves &s;he had ju&s;t been &s;cattering. After a moments &s;ilence, &s;he timidly added, &s;till with downca&s;t eyes,</P>
<P>"But I have never &s;een the Count, papa; and if I &s;hould not love him?"</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034126_0006_0FFA589E172A6B80">"You mu&s;t marry him, notwith&s;tanding, my child," in&s;tantly replied the Baron. "We only a&s;k your hand; there is no authority, royal or paternal, which can com|mand the heart."</P>
<P>This moral &s;entiment was, no doubt, a very &s;trange one to come from the mouth of a father; but the Baron, we may well conjecture, had his rea&s;ons for being thus relax.</P>
<P>Caroline replied, with &s;urpri&s;e, "Indeed, papa, I do not under&s;tand you. Give the Count my hand and not my heart! No, really, papa, I do not under&s;tand you!"</P>
<P>"You will do before you have lived &s;ix months at court," replied the Baron, as he ro&s;e. (Another proof, this, that the Baron was a courtier.) "But this is noth|ing to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. Give me thy promi&s;e, thy &s;olemn promi&s;e, my Caroline, that thou wilt fulfil the engagement I have entered into in thy name. I am wait|ed for at court; I will announce thy con&s;ent, dine there, and return, this evening, with the Count. Go, dre&s;s thy&s;elf, and prepare to receive the man who is &s;hortly to be thy hu&s;band."</P>
<P>After having received the &s;olemn promi&s;e of the gen|tle and tractable Caroline, and tenderly ki&s;&s;ed her, he departed, well &s;atisfied with his negotiation.</P>
<P>The reader, perhaps, may expect that the &s;weet Caro|line, left alone, would then, immediately, have abundance of &s;erious reflections on all that had pa&s;&s;ed; and particu|larly on the approaching marriage. For &s;ix-and-twenty the&s;e would have afforded &s;ufficient &s;ubject for a whole morning's contemplation; but, at &s;ixteen, the mind does not dwell &s;o long on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Truth, however, obliges us to remark that Caroline, after the departure of her father, remained full ten minutes in the &s;ame place and attitude; which certainly was a thing &s;omewhat ex|traordinary.</P>
<P>At length, finding &s;he had &s;o many things to think on that &s;he could ab&s;olutely think on nothing, and that the ru&s;hing ideas floated and whirled into confu&s;ion, &s;he &s;ud|denly &s;tarted up, ran to her piano forte, and played co|tillons and country dances, <HI>pre&s;to pre&s;ti&s;&s;imo,</HI> for a full half hour.</P>
<P>Now, while &s;he was playing, it happened naturally enough to &s;trike her active imagination, how delightfully
<PB N="8" REF="034126_0007_0FFA1A3315BAF148">
the Count would dance them all with her; "and it will be quite charming," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "to continually have a partner at one's command."</P>
<P>Dance!&mdash;His Excellency dance!&mdash;Yes, to be &s;ure; his Excellency dance: for the Baron had been very careful to inform her that, notwith&s;tanding his high rank, great dignity, and that he was al&s;o an Amba&s;&s;ador, he &s;till was not above thirty; which circum&s;tance, it is very probable, plea&s;ed her full as much as all the afore&s;aid titles, dazzling as they were: for though this was nearly twice the age of Caroline, &s;he had remarked that men of thirty, and wo|men of &s;ixteen, are a kind of cotemporaries.</P>
<P>Thus, forming the project of dancing everyday, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould be the mi&s;tre&s;s of her own hou&s;e, &s;he ran to the garden to gather a no&s;egay. There, as &s;he plucked the flowers, &s;he &s;aw &s;everal beautiful butterflies wanton|ing from bud to bud&punc; and, delighted with the re&s;tle&s;s va|grants, and their various hues, and vivid tints, began, with ardour, to pur&s;ue them: till, &s;omewhat heated and fatigued, without having had the good fortune to catch a &s;ingle fugitive, &s;he con&s;oled her&s;elf with &s;uppo&s;ing the Count, more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble and active than her, would catch them for her. "Be&s;ides," &s;aid &s;he, &s;kipping back to|wards the hou&s;e, "we &s;hall be very unfortunate, indeed, if we can't both of us entrap them."</P>
<P>The hour of dre&s;&s;ing &s;ucceeded, and, while at her toil|et, the idea of jewels, new dre&s;&s;es, equipage, balls, ope|ras, and a&s;&s;emblies, pre&s;ently made her forget the butter|flies: for, with the lively, the innocent, and the happy Caroline, one plea&s;ure came but to efface another.</P>
<P>"O yes," &s;aid &s;he, "I well know Amba&s;&s;adors' ladies are invited every where, are dre&s;&s;ed like queens, and are envied by the whole world. In&s;tead of &s;imple flowers, I &s;hall have clu&s;ters of diamonds adorning my hair; my dre&s;&s;es &s;hall be all the mo&s;t fanciful and elegant ever be|held, and I will put them on with a grace that &s;hall charm every eye, and win every heart."</P>
<P>Thus, the conjugal felicity of Caroline, founded on dre&s;s, dancing, and butterflies, &s;eemed to her the mo&s;t certain of all certain things: &s;he already beheld her&s;elf the happie&s;t of women, employed every moment to embelli&s;h her per&s;on, and enchant her Amba&s;&s;ador, and expected
<PB N="9" REF="034126_0008_0FFA58AC9421CF00">
him with an impatience unchecked by any fear, except that of not appearing &s;ufficiently hand&s;ome in his eyes.</P>
<P>As for him, &s;he was well a&s;&s;ured he would plea&s;e her infinitely; for, innocently thoughtle&s;s as &s;he appeared, &s;he &s;till had her moments of reflection; and, all circum|&s;tances again and again con&s;idered, had fully per&s;uaded her&s;elf the Count was the mo&s;t charming man in the world.</P>
<P>He was the King's Favorite! Her father had told her &s;o; and the word Favorite was mo&s;t exten&s;ive and &s;ig|nificant to the imagination of Caroline. She, in the country, had likewi&s;e had her little court, and her little Favorites; there was her favorite bird, her favorite lap|dog, her favorite lamb, and the&s;e were all the prettie&s;t creatures of their kind, &s;he had ever beheld; wherefore, there could be no doubt but the Favorite of a King mu&s;t be the Phoenix of Nature.</P>
<P>Of all this &s;he was &s;o perfectly convinced, &s;o happy, and &s;o rejoiced to think &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him, that, when her maid came to tell her he was come, and that her father waiting for her, &s;he made but one &s;kip from the gla&s;s to the door; where finding the High Chamberlain, who earne&s;tly bade her to remember her promi&s;e, he took her by the hand, which trembled with plea&s;ure and emo|tion between his, and, exorting her to be very prudent, and behave with great propriety, led her to the apart|ment in which was the Favorite of the King.</P>
<P>They entered, Caroline looked, and no &s;ooner &s;aw, than, in&s;tantly hiding her eyes with her hands, &s;he gave a piercing &s;hriek, and di&s;appeared like a fla&s;h of light|ning at midnight.</P>
<P>Now, while the father follows, while he employs the whole force of paternal eloquence to calm and make Ca|roline return, let us give the outline of the picture that thus had terrified; let us ju&s;tify the young and innocent Caroline.</P>
<P>The Count of Wal&s;tein was, in f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct, little more than thirty; but an enormous fear on one cheek, a counte|nance exce&s;&s;ively meagre and of a livid yellow, round &s;houlders, and, in&s;tead of hair, a periwig, made him ap|pear at lea&s;t fifty. His large black eye was fine; but, alas! it was &s;ingle; he had but one, the other a bullet had extingui&s;hed. Nature de&s;igned him for a tall and well-proportioned man, but a habit of &s;tooping had prevented
<PB N="10" REF="034126_0009_0FFA554314642B48">
her intent. He had one very good leg; but this hu&s;band, who was to dance from morning to night, and aid Caro|line to catch butter-flies, walked with difficulty, and limped exceedingly on the other.</P>
<P>Such was the exterior appearance of Wal&s;tein, and we &s;hall hereafter &s;ee how far the mind corre&s;ponded with the body, We have &s;aid enough, at pre&s;ent, to paliate the emotion and the flight of Caroline. Perhaps, we will not &s;ay but that, had &s;he taken time to con&s;ider and examine, &s;he might have found an air of grandeur, and a &s;omewhat of benevolence, characterizing this uncouth fi|gure. But &s;he &s;aw only the fear, the one eye, the round &s;houlders, the periwig, and the limping gait. She had received the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and, almo&s;t fainting in her apartment, Caroline &s;carcely heard her father's menaces and prayers to return. Her only an&s;wer was a torrent of tears, and her &s;truggles to overcome the &s;hock, rather increa&s;ed than repelled her di&s;order.</P>
<P>Her father, finding it impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould appear again at pre&s;ent, left her, and went back to the Count. He re|flected that this would certainly be the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e, and that his daughter's &s;udden illne&s;s would be &s;ufficient ex|cu&s;e.</P>
<P>He found his intended &s;on-in-law exceedingly agitated at his reception, and too truly &s;u&s;pecting the motive. But the High Chamberlain was &s;o eloquent, &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive, when he had any purpo&s;e to obtain, and his oratory was &s;o powerful on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, that the Count was appea&s;ed; fully convinced that a violent head-ach, the con&s;equence of the preparations of that bu&s;y day, which had &s;uddenly &s;eized Caroline, had been the &s;ole occa&s;ion of her exclamation and her flight. It may be, even, that he feigned conviction. Who dare be re&s;pon&s;ible for courtiers? Hi&s;torians, the mo&s;t exact, by them may be deceived.</P>
<P>Be the&s;e things as they may, he took leave of the High Chamberlain, hoping to find the young lady recovered, and not liable to the &s;ame di&s;order on the morrow; tho' it is very certain, Wal&s;tein found him&s;elf a good deal af|fected by what had pa&s;&s;ed. Not that we will &s;uppo&s;e him in love with Caroline, whom he had &s;carcely &s;een, but that this marriage was in many re&s;pects exceedingly &s;uita|ble to his wi&s;hes and his views; in&s;omuch that he thought
<PB N="11" REF="034126_0010_0FFA1C07907086D0">
the future happine&s;s of his life depended on it; not to mention the will and plea&s;ure of the King. This latter might be as &s;trong a rea&s;on for the Favorite as for the High Chamberlain; and the latter undoubtedly thought it irre&s;i&s;table. We mu&s;t own he would have been wi&s;e to have pre-informed his daughter of the per&s;on of the Count. He felt all this, and deeply regretted his want of fore&s;ight; but it was too late. He imagined it be&s;t to extort a pro|mi&s;e from which &s;he would not dare to recede. Little had he fore&s;een the effect of the fir&s;t interview, or the terror of Caroline, which was doubled by the imaginary and beautiful picture &s;he had formed of the Count.</P>
<P>The moment he was alone, he returned, and found her ju&s;t as he had left her. She had &s;till, however, &s;uf|ficient &s;trength to fall at his feet and implore his mercy, conjuring him, by every tender appellation, not thus to &s;acrifice his child.</P>
<P>The High Chamberlain &s;aw her emotion was too vio|lent for her to hear rea&s;on at that in&s;tant. We would not have the reader think it too &s;trange, but he was even affected him&s;elf, rai&s;ed her with tenderne&s;s, beg|ged her to be calm, and to a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf that her happi|ne&s;s was the utmo&s;t of his hopes, and that he would &s;peak with her on the &s;ubject the next morning; and, again exhorting her to be tranquil, leave weeping, and go to re&s;t, quitted her apartment.</P>
<P>The drowning wretch, 'tis &s;aid, will catch at &s;traws. Caroline ardently &s;eized this ray of hope, and her fears were almo&s;t hu&s;hed to peace. Ah! thought &s;he, how good is my papa! How dearly he loves me! How de&s;i|rous is he to &s;ee me happy! Surely then, &s;ince it is his wi&s;h, he will not unite me to a mon&s;ter who has but one eye, who&s;e legs do not pair, who is humpbacked, and who wears a periwig!</P>
<P>Caroline &s;aw defects ten-fold defective: but &s;uch is the nature of youth; its propen&s;ities, its pa&s;&s;ions, its love, its friend&s;hip, its aver&s;ions are all extremes. At fir&s;t &s;he thought her&s;elf lo&s;t beyond recovery; at pre&s;ent &s;he ima|gined her&s;elf freed for ever from the Count, and as &s;ud|denly recovered the gaiety that had &s;o &s;uddenly fled.&mdash; Somewhat wearied, however, &s;he went to bed, reflecting on the &s;trange and &s;ingular ta&s;te of Kings in the choice of their Favorites, and prote&s;ting that, were &s;he a Queen, Wal&s;tein never &s;hould be hers.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034126_0011_0FFA1A4F012D8380">As &s;ound was her &s;leep, and as gentle were her dreams, as if nothing had happened; and when the morning ap|peared, no &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion remained than that which an ugly vi&s;ion &s;ometimes occa&s;ions. Pre&s;ently her father entered, and found the &s;ame &s;mile, the &s;ame &s;weetne&s;s, the &s;ame infantine graces with which he was daily recei|ved. Nay, &s;he was fonder, more attentive, more eager to oblige than u&s;ual; and thanks for his conde&s;cen&s;ion, of which &s;he entertained no doubt, were in every motion and in every look; though &s;he dared not retrace the pa&s;t, her heart was all gratitude and joy for the future. Her father's behaviour increa&s;ed it; for, in&s;tead of reproach|es, his looks were all good nature, and kindne&s;s and &s;miles accompanied every expre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Let us, however, be ju&s;t: except his titles, his places, and his pen&s;ions, of all things in the world the Baron certainly loved his daughter the be&s;t. Not to mention that he really thought, for &s;uch was his manner of think|ing, he was laying the foundation of her future happine&s;s by &s;o high an alliance, &s;o magnificent a marriage! made immediately under the au&s;pices of the King! and by or|der of the King! and to the Favorite of the King! and with the daughter of the High Chamberlain of the King!</P>
<P>Determined, therefore, to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e, by prayer or by power, he thought it be&s;t fir&s;t to try how far affection and tenderne&s;s might win. Taking, therefore, his daughter's hands, and tenderly cla&s;ping them between his own&mdash;</P>

<P>"No exceptions, Caroline; and the fir&s;t proof of love I &s;hall a&s;k will be to li&s;ten to me &s;ilently and attentively.</P>
<P>"What woulde&s;t thou do, my child?" (The Baron changed his countenance; it was now all &s;entiment; it was an appeal to the be&s;t affections of the heart,) "What woulde&s;t thou do, Caroline, if the life of thy father were in thy hands?"</P>
<P>"His life! The life of my father! Save, pre&s;erve, cheri&s;h it, at the expence of my own. Can my father doubt it? But how&mdash;Wherefore, my&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I expected no le&s;s, my dear girl," replied the Baron, taking care to &s;top her in due time; "and thou thy&s;elf &s;hall decide between us.&mdash;Yes, my life, my very life de|pends upon the alliance.

Thus daring had my affection for thee, Caroline&punc; made me.</P>
<P>"Your daughter is a child," &s;aid the frowning mo|narch; "a baby who knows not what plea&s;es, or what is proper, and with whom you ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t according to your own prudence, not her caprice. You <HI>may,</HI> howe|ver, act as you plea&s;e. If &s;he per&s;i&s;t in this her refu&s;al, you will re-conduct her to her country retreat; and you will, likewi&s;e, remain there your&s;elf. It is impo&s;&s;ible &s;o feeble a father can be a good Mini&s;ter of State."</P>
<P>"He turned away, and &s;poke no more to me during the whole evening. Imagine, Caroline, what are my pre&s;ent feelings? I &s;aw the malicious joy of my enemies, they had marked my Sovereign's frowns, and, with the &s;mile of malignity, prophe&s;ied my approaching fall, di&s;|po&s;ed of my places, and, imitating their ma&s;ter, &s;cornful|ly turned from me. Oh my child! my Caroline! wilt

thou, the darling of thy father's heart, be the cau&s;e of this his mi&s;ery? What talk I of mi&s;ery? His certain, his in&s;tantaneous death!"</P>
<P>The trembling, the tender, the affectionate Caroline, a thou&s;and times more terrified by this idea than &s;he even had been by the a&s;pect of Wal&s;tein, &s;huddering, flung her&s;elf into her father's arms.</P>
<P>"I will obey, I will obey," repeated &s;he &s;obbing. "Lead me to the altar this moment; lead me, if &s;o it mu&s;t be! Cau&s;e your death! I! God of Heaven forbid! Oh! my father, go immediately, tell the King to di&s;po&s;e of me as he plea&s;es; only let him re&s;tore his favour and friend&s;hip to my father. Yes, I promi&s;e, &s;olemnly pro|mi&s;e, to &s;ubmit to his will; but do thou, al&s;o, my father, promi&s;e me not to die."</P>
<P>So &s;trongly had the idea of her father's death &s;eized upon her imagination that &s;he feared le&s;t a moment's de|lay might make it certain. She would willingly have gone, even her&s;elf, and told the Count &s;he was ready to be his; and cea&s;ed not to intercede with the Baron to depart, in|&s;tantly, to the King; again engaging her&s;elf, by promi|&s;es the mo&s;t po&s;itive and unlimited, to be in all things obedient.</P>
<P>Once more left alone, &s;he thought no more of court balls, cotillons, or cha&s;ing butterflies. With one hand hiding her eyes, mournfully re&s;ting upon her elbow, and agitated by a thou&s;and &s;truggling &s;en&s;ations, &s;he remained motionle&s;s; incoherently dreading le&s;t the lea&s;t change or movement might precipitate her into the gulph that &s;eemed gaping to receive her, and in which &s;he were then eternally &s;unk. Filial affection, at length, came to her aid. Once more erect &s;he &s;at, with &s;elf-approbation rai|&s;ed, when &s;he recollected that, by &s;uffering her&s;elf, &s;he &s;hould &s;ave her father. "I &s;hall pre&s;erve his honour, and, with his honour, his life," &s;aid &s;he, with affection and admiration mingled: her own heroi&s;m in&s;pired the latter; and which a &s;entiment &s;o virtuous ever mu&s;t in|&s;pire in a noble mind.</P>
<P>"Yet how dear mu&s;t I pay for this!" continued &s;he, "and what &s;hall my life be?"</P>
<P>Straight the image and figure of the Count pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and the father vani&s;hed. Caroline &s;huddering, re|coiled, and doubted whether yet &s;he &s;hould keep her word.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="034126_0014_0FFA1BC86423F7E8">In this attitude, in this agitation, &s;he continued, when her father &s;uddenly returned, Joy exce&s;&s;ive brightened in his countenance. Scarcely could he tell, &s;o out of breath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith ha&s;te and tran&s;ported was he, that the King him&s;elf and the Count were coming. "Yes, the King! The King in per&s;on!" repeated he: "Publicly coming! and tho&s;e who ye&s;terday rejoiced at my di&s;grace, may now retire and weep. May their own envy be their only com|forter. See, my Caroline, my child, my darling, what obedience is, and what &s;hall be its reward."</P>
<P>Caroline, alas! thought not of rewards, but of pun|i&s;hments, and of the confirmation of the fearful &s;entence &s;he her&s;elf had pronounced. Her father reproved her for not having employed the time of his ab&s;ence at her toilette. The day before, &s;he her&s;elf would have been very &s;orry to have been caught by Maje&s;ty in her pre&s;ent di&s;habille; but, at pre&s;ent, this was become a trifle beneath thought; and &s;he waited, in expectation of her augu&s;t vi&s;itor, without once ca&s;ting a look towards the gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The Baron was in his fourth repetition of the manner in which &s;he &s;hould comport her&s;elf, when he was inter|rupted by the rattling of the coach wheels. Up he &s;tarted, ran to receive Maje&s;ty, and left the trembling Caroline to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;alts, and as much fortitude as &s;he her|&s;elf could collect, for this interview of con&s;traint and dread. The Monarch entered, followed only by his Favorite and his High Chamberlain, elate with joy, and in&s;tated with &s;elf-applau&s;e.</P>
<P>"Beauteous Caroline," &s;aid the king, as he advanced and pre&s;ented the Count, "be thou the recompen&s;e of the man who has rendered me &s;o many important &s;ervices; and do thou, dear Wal&s;tein, receive, from my hand, this lovely bride, who&s;e worth, I am certain, thou wilt well know how to e&s;timate."</P>
<P>The Count drew near, and, taking the half retiring hand of Caroline, begged her, with a low and timid ac|cent, kindly to confirm his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Had the riches of the whole world, and all its Mon|archs, been pro&s;trate at the feet of Caroline, &s;he could not have articulated a &s;ingle word. Perhaps, had &s;he rai&s;ed her down ca&s;t eyes, and looked at the bridegroom, &s;he might have had &s;ufficient power to have &s;aid no. But this &s;he very prudently avoided. She made a mo&s;t re&s;pect|ful
<PB N="16" REF="034126_0015_0FFA556A40003E80">
courte&s;y, and, at the king's de&s;ire, &s;at down in &s;ilence. This command was well timed: had &s;he been longer re|quired to &s;tand, the &s;cene of over-night might again have been repeated. A univer&s;al tremor had come over her; &s;he was obliged to have recour&s;e to her &s;alts, and might &s;till, perhaps, have betrayed her feelings by a fainting fit, or a deluge of tears, had not a glance of her father, him|&s;elf almo&s;t fainting at &s;eeing her agitation, re&s;tored her all her fortitude: &s;he even forced a &s;mile, to quiet his fears, and collected the re&s;olution to an&s;wer the King's conde|&s;cending interrogation, by &s;aying, &s;he was very well. Every thing was then placed to the account of country education and virgin timidity.</P>
<P>She hoped the company would retire, or, at lea&s;t, change the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation; but &s;he was deceived. To re&s;pect the feelings of their &s;ubjects is one of tho&s;e things that Kings under&s;tand the lea&s;t; and his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, delighted with the marriage he him&s;elf had made, could talk of nothing el&s;e. Totally inattentive to the &s;uffering Caroline, he dwelt circum&s;tantially on particu|lars, fir&s;t naming the day, then the hour, and then the place of performing the ceremony.</P>
<P>Unable to &s;upport this any longer, Caroline, at length, made another effort, and begged permi&s;&s;ion to retire. Her prayer was granted, and the Monarch did not neglect, as &s;he made her reverence, to &s;alute her by the title of the Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein.</P>
<P>The youthful and wretched Counte&s;s, alone in her apartment, gave a full flow to affliction. Finding, how|ever, that tormenting reflection could not change her de&s;|tiny, <HI>that</HI> now being fixed beyond the power of reprieve, &s;he wi&s;ely concluded &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was her only cour&s;e; and to take &s;uch advantage as her pre&s;ent &s;ituation might afford her be&s;t expedient.</P>
<P>Let no one be a&s;toni&s;hed to hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat a young girl of &s;ixteen could rea&s;on thus prudently. Misfortune is a mo&s;t able ma&s;ter; and a few hours of affliction, trouble, and terror, had taught Caroline more than years of tran|quillity. She heard the coach of the King depart with much le&s;s emotion than &s;he felt at its thundering approach; and her father had the &s;atisfaction to find her tolerably calm and re&s;igned, when he came to acquaint her with the royal arrangements.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="034126_0016_0FFA58C49CE1FB60">The marriage was fixed for that day week; the Count had de&s;ired it might be as &s;ecret as po&s;&s;ible, and celebra|ted at his country &s;eat, &s;ix leagues from Berlin; and, moreover, that the rejoicings, vi&s;its, bride-favours, and pre&s;entation of the Counte&s;s at court, &s;hould not take place till the ceremony was over.</P>
<P>Caroline highly approved the Count's plan, and beg|ged her father's permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s the intervening time in retirement. So well plea&s;ed was the Baron with her doc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lity, that, except breaking off the marriage, there was nothing &s;he could have a&s;ked he would have refu&s;ed; he therefore promi&s;ed, and kept his word. Her &s;olitude was uninterrupted, except by a few vi&s;its from the bride|groom; and him the Baron undertook to hold in conver|&s;ation. Thus, while they were deep in politics, debating on matters of high moment, States, Empires, and Kings, Caroline was &s;ilently determining to execute the projects &s;he had formed.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not follow her through the many and melan|choly ideas which occupied her mind, during this peni|tential week; it is &s;ufficient for us to ob&s;erve that &s;he might, truly, be &s;aid to have thought more, in that &s;pace of time, than &s;he had done in the whole cour&s;e of her life. With the re&s;ult of all this thinking we &s;hall pre|&s;ently become acquainted.</P>
<P>Time pa&s;&s;es away as well in plea&s;ure as in pain. Be|hold then the redoubted day, on which the &s;ate of Caro|line was irrevocably to be fixed. She was prepared for it, and appeared perfectly re&s;igned. Her father was in ec&s;tacies, for he was now at the height of all his happi|ne&s;s and honours. Maje&s;ty, in per&s;on, intended to ac|company his daughter to the altar. The High Chamber|lain, good man, would have been happy to have had the whole world &s;pectators; but two Lords of the court, and their wives, were alone appointed a&s;&s;i&s;tants. He con&s;o|led him&s;elf, however, with the idea of the many fine things he &s;hould have to relate on his return to Berlin. Off they &s;et, for the country &s;eat of the Count; and the tender bride, more thoughtful than melancholy, not only &s;upported the journey exceedingly well, but even the marriage ceremony, which was immediately performed on their arrival: the Baron, wondering at, and ble&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf
<PB N="18" REF="034126_0017_0FFA557FAE594F88">
for, the dexterity and addre&s;s with which he had in|&s;ured the obedience of Caroline, had, at length, the in|expre&s;&s;ible gratification of pre&s;enting her to the King by the title of the <HI>Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein!</HI></P>
<P>This was the only moment in which the fortitude of Caroline had nearly for&s;aken her. Affected, agitated, by the care&s;&s;es of the High Chamberlain, who was unbound|ed in his panegyric, &s;he owned &s;he de&s;erved not all this prai&s;e, and earne&s;tly &s;upplicated him to &s;pare her.

<P>They were to return that evening to Berlin, there to in|&s;tall the young Counte&s;s in her new dignity, as Lady of Wal&s;tein Hou&s;e; and they were already preparing to depart, when, taking advantage of the moment when the Count was &s;tanding alone, concealed by the projecting of the window, &s;he went up to him, pre&s;ented a paper, en|treated him to read it with indulgence, and retired into an anti-chamber, where, &s;he told him, &s;he would wait for his an&s;wer, and his orders. Surpri&s;ed as much as man could po&s;&s;ibly be, the Count in&s;tantly opened the letter, and read:</P>
<P>"My Lord,</P>
<P>"I have obeyed. The ab&s;olute commands of my father and my King have given me to you, and yours at pre&s;ent I am; wholly yours; I acknowledge no other ma&s;ter&punc; You only have the right to di&s;po&s;e of me, and from you I dare a&s;k and hope benevolence, indulgence, and gene|ro&s;ity. Yes, it is from him who ju&s;t has &s;worn to make me happy I now pre&s;ume to a&s;k what may a&s;certain my happine&s;s, and, no doubt, his own. You know not, my Lord, cannot imagine, how much the young creature, to whom you but this in&s;tant gave your hand, is unworthy of that honour; how little rea&s;onable &s;he is, and how much a child; how much it behoves her to pa&s;s whole years in that retreat where &s;he has been educated, and with that dear friend who has been to her a mother. Oh, con&s;ent! I conjure you in mercy to con&s;ent and &s;uffer me this evening to return to Rindaw; there to wait till my rea&s;on has &s;o far conquered prejudice that I may &s;ubmit, without expiring, to engagements I have formed. By doing this, you will en&s;ure gratitute inexpre&s;&s;ible, and, perhaps, accelerate that event. Your refu&s;ed on the

contrary&mdash;Yes, be certain, your refu&s;al will, equally, and forever, deprive you of the wretched Caroline.</P>
<P>"I feel, mo&s;t forcibly, the ju&s;t reproaches I merit by acting thus. This letter &s;hould not have been &s;ent now; but, had I explained what my &s;en&s;ations were before our union, I &s;hould have hazarded the life of my father: at pre&s;ent I only hazard my own. He &s;wore, &s;olemnly &s;wore, he could not &s;urvive his di&s;grace; and his di&s;grace was inevitable if I did not become yours. Yours, there|fore, I am, and the King now will re&s;t &s;atisfied: for I dare hope that, &s;hould he make my father re&s;pon&s;ible for my conduct, and &s;hould this conduct offend him, you will have the ju&s;tice to &s;ave my father, and inform him, that I alone am culpable. But certainly the King cannot com|plain of his want of zeal, or the unlimited obedience with which he is devoted to his will; neither will I complain, if you, only, will have the goodne&s;s to grant my pre&s;ent reque&s;t."</P>
<P>This letter, the offspring of a hundred, which had been written and torn during the preceding week, had been fini&s;hed that very morning before they left Berlin. If ever man was a&s;toni&s;hed, confounded, thunder&s;truck, it was the Count of Wal&s;tein. He could not believe what he beheld. What! a young creature &s;o timid, and &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive! Had &s;he a will of her own? And could &s;he declare what that will was with fortitude like this?</P>
<P>Again he read the paper, and pity pre&s;ently &s;ucceeded to &s;urpri&s;e. He then &s;aw &s;he had been the &s;acrifice of de&s;poti&s;m and ambition; and mortally reproached him&s;elf for being the object and the cau&s;e. Though we all may be &s;omewhat deceived re&s;pecting our own per&s;onal attrac|tions, and though the Count, like others, might not be wholly exempt from &s;elf-illu&s;ion, he &s;till did him&s;elf the ju&s;tice to imagine he certainly had not been married for his beauty; but, from the po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances of the High Chamberlain, and the apparent re&s;ignation of Caroline, he &s;uppo&s;ed, at lea&s;t, it had been witho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gnance, and without con&s;traint. The moment that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> deceived him, or, rather, told him he had been deceived, was no doubt to him a dreadful one; but he did not he&s;itate an in&s;tant concerning how it was proper for him now to act. De&s;irous to relieve Caroline from her fears, he, with his pencil, wrote thus on the cover of her letter&punc;</P>

<P><HI>Beloved,</HI> Wal&s;tein would have added; but it was a mo|ment of mo&s;t trying affliction. A mirror hung over the table at which he wrote; he looked in it and dur&s;t not. Half opening the door of the anti-chamber, where Caro|line waited the &s;entence of life or death, he gave in his &s;hort an&s;wer, which &s;he tremblingly received, and in&s;tant|ly di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation of Caroline, when &s;he attempted to read, was dread; but this, as &s;he proceeded was pre&s;ently di&s;&s;ipated, and when &s;he had ended &s;he was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;o affected, &s;o grateful, that &s;he had almo&s;t an inclination to recall the Count; but unfortunately for him, as &s;he looked through the window, &s;he &s;aw him walking in the gardens with the King. Walking and broad day-light are little favourable to a man who limps in his gait, and who&s;e face is disfigured by wounds. Could &s;he have read his billet, and forgot his per&s;on, the effect would have been different; her favourable ideas would not have been &s;o ea&s;ily effaced, nor would &s;he, &s;o in&s;tantly, again have felt that impatient de&s;ire of returning to her former retreat. Be&s;ides, indeed, &s;he recollected it was too late; that &s;he had gone too far to recede, without appearing capricious and weak. While thus &s;he reflected, &s;till looking through the window at the Count, his billet crumbled away be|tween her fingers, and, like the impre&s;&s;ion it had made, was no more.</P>
<P>While Caroline was thus employed, the generous Wal|&s;tein was u&s;ing all his influence with the King, over who&s;e mind he had a wonderful a&s;cendency, per&s;uading him to con&s;ent to the reque&s;t &s;he had made. He &s;hewed

his Maje&s;ty the letter, who, in&s;tead of anger, found him|&s;elf intere&s;ted and affected by the &s;tyle and re&s;olution of a girl &s;o innocent and &s;o young.</P>
<P>"There is energy in this young lady's character," &s;aid the monarch, as he ended, and looking at the Count as he returned the letter.</P>
<P>He looked, and could not help acknowledging that his Favorite did not, altogether, po&s;&s;e&s;s that kind of form which the hoping fancy of &s;ixteen loves to contemplate. The recollection came a little too late, but the moment was favourable to Caroline, and he added&mdash;</P>
<P>"You are right, Wal&s;tein. You mu&s;t overlook this whim. She is a child, whom it will be be&s;t to indulge. She will &s;oon be tired of her retreat; and as to the thing mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, the fortune, it is yours. A man has al|ways enough of his wife's company."</P>
<P>The Monarch was frank; but, &s;tate &s;ecrets excepted, Monarchs take little trouble to di&s;gui&s;e their thoughts. Accordingly, the &s;entence pronounced, the High Cham|berlain was &s;ent for, this new project communicated, and his daughter's letter &s;hewn. He was, certainly, in a very high pa&s;&s;ion, but the pre&s;ence of Maje&s;ty made him, apparently, &s;omewhat calm: and, after hazarding a few objections, which were &s;ilenced, he was all acquie&s;cence. The King, indeed, who had never before &s;een him of a different opinion, thought it exceedingly &s;trange, and, likewi&s;e, &s;omewhat pre&s;uming, he &s;hould be &s;o at pre|&s;ent; which thoughts he did not take the lea&s;t trouble to conceal. Whereupon the High Chamberlain, a little affrighted, made a mo&s;t profound and reverential bow, &s;upplicated pardon, and begged his Maje&s;ty would di&s;po&s;e of his daughter ju&s;t as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of this con&s;ultation was that Caroline &s;hould return, that very evening, to Rindaw; where the Barone&s;s and Canone&s;s of that name, by whom &s;he had been educated, lived. Here &s;he had permi&s;&s;ion to remain as long as &s;he plea&s;ed, concluding &s;he would &s;oon be glad to return. A clau&s;e was, indeed, annexed, which &s;eemed to render a long &s;tay impo&s;&s;ible; and this was, that the mo&s;t profound and ab&s;olute &s;ecrecy mu&s;t be kept concerning the marriage. The King did not give his rea&s;ons; indeed, Rea&s;on to Kings is a &s;uperfluous thing, Will is &s;ufficient. It has, moreover, been &s;aid, he was

fearful le&s;t this hi&s;tory &s;hould ca&s;t &s;ome kind of ridicule either upon his High Chamberlain, or his Favorite, or, perhaps, even upon him&s;elf; but, we mu&s;t own, this a&s;&s;ertion is too improbable to be true.</P>
<P>Leave we the&s;e in the uncertainty in which we found them, and let us add that it was his Maje&s;ty's command Caroline &s;hould &s;till pa&s;s by her own name, and that no individual &s;hould know &s;he was the Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein. He went &s;o far as to declare that, the moment the lea&s;t breath tran&s;pired, &s;he &s;hould again beome &s;ubject to con|jugal power, and that her indi&s;cretion &s;hould en&s;ure the lo&s;s of his favour. All this he &s;aid, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at the High Chamberlain, who could not get the words out fa&s;t enough to inform his Maje&s;ty of the eternal &s;ilence he him&s;elf &s;hould keep.</P>
<P>The King, likewi&s;e, pre&s;&s;ingly, recommended &s;ecre|cy to tho&s;e who had been pre&s;ent at the ceremony; who readily promi&s;ed obedience, and who readily did not tell it&mdash;to above &s;ome thirty of their friends; and that under the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es it &s;hould go no farther. Ah, happy Berlin! that thus, for a whole week, was plen|tifully &s;upplied with behind-fan whi&s;pers and corner con|ver&s;ations!&mdash;"Do <HI>you</HI> know that Count Wal&s;tein has married the High Chamberlain's daughter!&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;Oh! the King him&s;elf was pre&s;ent!&mdash;Indeed! &mdash;Fact, I a&s;&s;ure you! I had it from the fir&s;t hand; but don't mention it; don't let my name appear," &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus ran Rumour, or rather, thus &s;he flew; but as there was no farther confirmation of the&s;e whi&s;perings, as Caroline did not appear, as the Count returned quietly on his emba&s;&s;y to Ru&s;&s;ia, as the High Chamberlain was di&s;creet, and as, moreover, new &s;ecrets made the old for|gotten, it was, at length, either not believed or not re|membered.</P>
<P>Behold, then, the nuptial day concluded in a very different manner from&punc; what might have been imagined. The Baron was required to inform his daughter that her reque&s;t was granted, and that &s;he had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to live retired at Rindaw. He was, likewi&s;e, to have conducted her thither him&s;elf; but Wal&s;tein, fearing he &s;hould ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t upon her that wrath which had been &s;o much curbed by the King, was de&s;irous to bereave his young bride of &s;o di&s;agreeable a travelling companion. He therefore, ea|&s;ily
<PB N="23" REF="034126_0022_0FFA58DE12E789E0">
pur&s;uaded his dear father-in-law that it was mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial to his intere&s;t not to leave the Court, in this critical conjuncture; and as the High Chamberlain had not the &s;ame ta&s;te for retirement with his daughter, he thought proper to confide her to the care of tru&s;ty &s;ervants, and to &s;end a letter by her to his dear friend the Barone&s;s and Canone&s;s, for &s;he was both, of Rindaw.</P>
<P>This Canone&s;s, with whom we &s;hall &s;oon become ac|quainted, was a mo&s;t excellent lady in her way. She had formerly been deeply in love with the High Chamberlain who likewi&s;e, had him&s;elf been as much in love with her as it was po&s;&s;ible for him to be; but rea&s;ons of conve|nience, wealth, and ambition, ever deci&s;ive with the High Chamberlain, had determined him to marry the mo|ther of Caroline. The affectionate, the tender, and con|&s;tant Barone&s;s, thus cro&s;&s;ed in love, had vowed celibacy, became a Canone&s;s, retired totally from the fa&s;hionable world, and lived privately at her chateau. To meditate on her perfidious High Chamberlain, renew her vows of eternal fidelity, read novels and romances from morning till night, imagine parallels between her&s;elf and the hero|ine of the tale, to faunter in her gardens, and mu&s;e for hours in lonely arbours, had been her mode of life for &s;everal years. This pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o &s;trong, might be &s;aid, at la&s;t, to peri&s;h of inanity and want of food. Therefore, when her dear Chamberlain, become a widower, offered to recompen&s;e her con&s;tancy by marriage, &s;he was prudent enough to refu&s;e, alleging &s;he had totally lo&s;t the habits of high life, and all reli&s;h for courts: which indeed was very true: but, plea&s;ed with the propo&s;al, &s;he promi&s;ed eternal friend&s;hip, offered to take his daughter under her care, and educate her till the time of her marriage. We have before &s;een the motives which determined the Baron to accept this offer; and the rather, mode&s;tly added he, becau&s;e he really knew nothing of the education of a daughter.</P>
<P>It might be pre&s;umed, our romantic Barone&s;s knew, perhaps, as little as him&s;elf of the matter; but no; a few ridiculous &s;ingularities excepted, &s;he did not want under|&s;tanding, and was really, and earne&s;tly, de&s;irous to fulfil the duty &s;he had undertaken. She had read much, had addicted her&s;elf to various u&s;eful &s;tudies, and had become very capable of in&s;tructing her pupil, and of forming her heart and mind.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="034126_0023_0FFA55A76139CC60">Some remains we own there were of ancient habitudes; of a &s;entimental and Quixote imagination: and this was the more plea&s;ant by being a &s;ingular contra&s;t to her natu|ral character, which was indi&s;cretion per&s;onified; though &s;he had an inexhau&s;tible goodne&s;s of heart. But it has been remarked that the&s;e two qualities are very frequently companions, and the Canone&s;s was an in&s;tance of its truth. She was &s;o frank, &s;o un&s;u&s;picious, &s;o confiding, and lo|ved &s;o much to talk, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for her to keep a &s;ecret above half an hour. And, as for friends, eve|ry per&s;on &s;he &s;aw might &s;oon become her deare&s;t intimate.</P>
<P>Her reputation was &s;o well known, even at court, and her indi&s;cretions &s;o indubitable, that there was an ab&s;olute prohibition laid on Caroline not to tell her the &s;ecret, as well as on the High Chamberlain. Caroline, who dread|ed daily remon&s;trances and per&s;ecutions, was happy at the interdict.</P>
<P>The obedient Baron, ever &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his Ma&s;ter's will, wrote, by his order, to the Canone&s;s, that the pro|jected marr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age of his daughter being deferred for &s;ome time, he again confided her to the care of his dear friend, the Barone&s;s.</P>
<P>Caroline, provided with this letter, took leave of her father kneeling for pardon and benediction. The High Chamberlain, well &s;atisfied, High Chamberlain to remain, granted both the one and the other with a tenderne&s;s that did not come truly from the heart. He &s;aw her depart for Rindaw, which was only &s;even or eight leagues thence, and &s;oon after, returned him&s;elf to Berlin, with the King and the Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>Caroline could not help being &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, at fir&s;t, at &s;eeing her&s;elf alone in one of the Count's carria|ges. Affected by her father's farewell and the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events, it would be difficult to de&s;cribe ex|actly what pa&s;&s;ed in her mind; all there was tumult and di&s;order, and &s;he &s;carcely knew whether it were better to rejoice or weep: all things happened as &s;he her&s;elf had de&s;ired; but, perhaps, though &s;he did not confe&s;s that to her&s;elf, &s;he expected to meet with more re&s;i&s;tance; and Caroline was not the only per&s;on to whom the facility of obtaining a ble&s;&s;ing had dimini&s;hed its value.</P>
<P>Perhaps, too, her &s;elf-love, or her vanity, if any &s;uch quality could re&s;ide in a brea&s;t &s;o pure, would have been
<PB N="25" REF="034126_0024_0FFA58E91EF1D830">
more flattered, had a greater de&s;ire to detain her been de|mon&s;trated. "Here I am," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf (and with a &s;mall tincture of &s;orrow was it &s;aid), "Here I am, all alone, left by my&s;elf; I &s;aid but a word, and my father, the King, and the Count, all three are agreed I may go as &s;oon as I plea&s;e. Is this indifference, anger or genero&s;ity?"</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e meditations &s;he recollected the &s;hort billet &s;he had torn, and endeavoured again to recall every expre&s;&s;ion, and every word. She &s;aw the action of the Count, at la&s;t, in the mo&s;t amiable, the mo&s;t generous point of view; a tear &s;tarted into her eye, and &s;he &s;ighed and &s;aid, "What a pity it is he &s;hould not be hand&s;ome!"</P>
<P>Her thoughts, mingled with regret, turned, occa&s;ional|ly towards her father al&s;o, whom &s;he had for&s;aken, whom &s;he had afflicted, and a little, likewi&s;e, on the plea&s;ures &s;he had abandoned, and the &s;ounding titles &s;he might have borne. My Lady, the Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s of Wal&s;tein! The Ru&s;|&s;ian Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady! The Lady of the Favorite of the King! All the&s;e &s;he might have been: &s;he was &s;imply Caroline. At certain moments her head was half out of the coach to bid them drive back to Berlin; but the&s;e might be called moments of forgetfulne&s;s; the image of the Count returned, pre&s;ented it&s;elf, &s;he &s;hrunk back, hid her&s;elf in the corner, and, congratulating her&s;elf on her e&s;cape, "No, it is impo&s;&s;ible," &s;aid &s;he, "it is impo&s;&s;i|ble I ever could &s;upport! I &s;hould die with apprehen&s;ion: and to &s;ee him every day, and all the day, and all the night! Oh! no, it is impo&s;&s;ible!" Then did &s;he applaud her fortitude, and the manner in which &s;he had fulfilled her duty, &s;aved her father's life, and pre&s;erved her liberty.</P>
<P>With the&s;e ideas, and &s;uch as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e was her full heart occupied for two thirds of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, but the nearer &s;he approached to Rindaw the feebler grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r regret; &s;he, pre&s;ently, thought only of the plea&s;ure of again &s;eeing her dear Mamma; for thus &s;he called the Canone&s;s, who, really, to her, had been a mother, and a tender mother.</P>
<P>This Lady idolized her pupil, and &s;eemed to have transferred the tender affection &s;he once felt for the father to the child. When the Baron had come for Caroline, and had told the Canone&s;s his intention to marry her, &s;o great was her de&s;pair, and &s;o violent the efforts of &s;epara|tion, that her health was injured; &s;he had been ill ever &s;ince; mirth, plea&s;ure, happine&s;s fled with Caroline.

<P>Imagine, then, what was the joy of all the&s;e good peo|ple, when, one evening, by the clear light of the moon, a coach drove through the village (a thing that &s;eldom happened, at Rindaw), and &s;topped at the Chateau, and as it &s;topped, and as the eager inhabitants crowded to &s;ee what and who it was, Caroline, their beloved, their ado|red Caroline, appeared. Enraptured to behold her, for the &s;mile and the flu&s;h of joy on Caroline's countenance acted with &s;ympathetic magic on them all, they knew not what to &s;ay, how to te&s;tify then feelings.</P>
<P>"Are not you glad, my dear friends," &s;aid &s;he, "that I am come again to live among you; again am one of your&s;elves Are you not glad to &s;ee me once more?"</P>
<P>Eager enthu&s;ia&s;m and tumultuous rapture &s;poke, but they &s;poke in confu&s;ion; and, their cries reaching the ear of the Canone&s;s, &s;he ran out to &s;ee what all this noi&s;e meant. She ran, and &s;he beheld&mdash;Yes, it was Caroline&mdash; Her beloved! Her child! Her darling! She was in her arms, and the &s;weet tears of &s;en&s;ibility, unre&s;trained, flowed plenteou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"Mamma! Mamma! My dear Mamma, your happy Caroline is returned, never to leave you more!"</P>
<P>The Canone&s;s was the daughter of Sen&s;ibility: her frame was &s;lender, her habit &s;ickly, and her nerves deli|cate. Caroline was alarmed to &s;ee her &s;o much affected, her joy amounted almo&s;t, to &s;uffocation; but the effects of joy are not often fatal. She recovered by degrees, and began to inquire of her beloved pupil what enchantment had conveyed her thither. Caroline, without further ex|planation, gave her the letter of the High Chamberlain; &s;he read it, and wanted further information concerning this marriage deferred ju&s;t at the moment of its conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"The la&s;t po&s;t," &s;aid the Barone&s;s, "brought me a let|ter from thy father, which informed me the day was fix|ed&mdash;The day fixed!&mdash;Yea, it was this very day, I believe &mdash;Let me &s;ee&mdash;Yes, it was this very day&mdash;This is very &s;trange!&mdash;I declare it is the mo&s;t &s;ingular adventure I ever heard of, and I delight in &s;ingular adventures&mdash;Tell me, tell me the whole, how was it?

<P>To come as near the truth, however, as po&s;&s;ible, for fal&s;ehood and Caroline were natural foes, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he her&s;elf was the cau&s;e of delay, that &s;he could not en|dure the deformity of the Count, for which rea&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, "they have granted me a re&s;pite, but I am certain I &s;hall never change."</P>
<P>She then, by way of excu&s;e, gave her friend a portrait of Wal&s;tein, which &s;he undoubtedly did not much em|belli&s;h. The Barone&s;s &s;carcely could let her fini&s;h, &s;o highly was &s;he provoked that they &s;hould ever once think of marrying her &s;weet Caroline to &s;uch a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>"The High Chamberlain has certainly lo&s;t his under|&s;tanding!" &s;aid &s;he.

The High Chamberlain had another motive, indeed, for his &s;ilence; he hoped dulne&s;s would &s;oon make her tired of her retreat; and Wal&s;tein, remembering only how much pain it mu&s;t co&s;t her to reply, was &s;ilent le&s;t he

Hoping every thing, therefore, from time and maturity of rea&s;on, he patiently waited their effects, and returned to Peter&s;burg and his duty.

<P>The re&s;ult of all this was, that Caroline had &s;carcely remained three months at Rindaw before all that had pa&s;|&s;ed appeared but as a dream; which &s;he &s;carcely could, and never wi&s;hed perfectly to recollect. She was even careful to bani&s;h all ideas from her mind that were any way relative to the Count, and no one &s;ought to make her remember them.</P>
<P>Her friend, perceiving that at the very name of Wal|&s;tein her countenance was clouded and her mind di&s;turb|ed, was careful never to pronounce it; and thus, at length was this union &s;o far effac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d from her mind, that had any one a&s;ked her if &s;he was married, the probabilities were th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;he would, in the fir&s;t moment of forgetfulne&s;s, very &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rely have an&s;wered, No.</P>

Reading was not neglected, and her natural good ta&s;te led her to a proper choice of books. Her per&s;on kept pace with her mind, and advanced to angelic perfection. Each &s;ucceeding day &s;eemed to be|&s;tow &s;ome new grace, and, all beautiful as &s;he was one month, &s;he was evidently more beautiful the next. She grew taller, and her &s;hape was &s;o fine, each limb and fea|ture
<PB N="31" REF="034126_0030_0FFA59014A7D8048">
&s;o proportionate, her colour was &s;o blooming, the white &s;o pure, the red &s;o tran&s;parent, her eyes &s;o mild, &s;o large, &s;o expre&s;&s;ive&punc; &s;o innocent and yet &s;o animated, that it was a delight to look upon her. Virgin timidity &s;he had, but no ill-timed ba&s;hfulne&s;s that makes even the form of beauty unmeaning: if the &s;ympathetic tale of feeling were told, the precious pearl of &s;en&s;ibility would brighten in her eye, and fall on her cheek; and if the poet, with &s;ublime hand, touched the lyre, genius would in&s;tantly ru&s;h on her imagination, animate her form, and illuminate her countenance.</P>
<P>Her voice too &s;he learnt to modulate, and it acquired a &s;weetne&s;s and flexibility that, when &s;he &s;ang to the harp, or Spani&s;h guitar, it was not po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e mild emotions, tho&s;e delicious &s;en&s;ations, which &s;he &s;o well could feel, and &s;o powerfully in&s;pire.</P>
<P>To the&s;e, her talents, her graces and her gifts, &s;he ad|ded another; which, though perhaps not &s;o e&s;teemed, is &s;till more uncommon, and not le&s;s captivating. There was an elegant &s;implicity and an air of dignity in her dre&s;s that &s;eemed to make grace it&s;elf more graceful. The&s;e, added to her bright auburn ringlets, profu&s;e in growth and flowing on her neck and &s;houlders, made her a crea|ture &s;uch as the imagination &s;carcely can conceive, and &s;uch as tongue or pen mu&s;t never hope to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;uch, and &s;till more beauteous, was Caroline, at &s;ixteen, while all the&s;e blooming &s;weets &s;eemed doomed to wither in the de&s;ert air, un&s;een, except by the homely village &s;wains, unadmired, except by the good Canone&s;s.</P>
<P>She, it is true, was all ec&s;tacy, and never cea&s;ed regret|ting the happy times of knighthood, and enamoured che|valiers, when Caroline would have, undoubtedly, been the paragon of courts, the arbitre&s;s of tilts and tourna|ments, and the reward of valour that never had been equalled. How often did &s;he vow, as &s;he beheld her, &s;ilently appealing to every &s;acred power, that the Count of Wal&s;tein never &s;hould be ma&s;ter of &s;uch a profu&s;ion of charms! How unappea&s;eable, how enraged, how furious would &s;he have been, had &s;he known &s;he was already his, and that Caroline was thus improving, thus embelli&s;hing for him alone! A Prince, at lea&s;t, &s;he de&s;erved; but might the Canone&s;s have cho&s;en, it &s;hould have been a hu&s;band of romance, beauteous as A&s;tolpho, faithful as Amadis, and tender as Celadon: neither could &s;he help

being a&s;toni&s;hed to find that they did not come in crowds to Rindaw, to di&s;pute the hand of the lovely Caroline.</P>
<P>As to Caroline her&s;elf, &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed at none of the&s;e things, and only de&s;ired to remain where &s;he was. Ever peaceable, and ever bu&s;y, happine&s;s &s;eemed incapa|ble of increa&s;e, except that, &s;ometimes, when &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one, and even in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e occupations &s;he mo&s;t delighted in, &s;he would feel a kind of mild melancholy come over her, or rather a dream, a reverie without &s;ub|ject, and without end, of which &s;he knew not, nor &s;ought the cau&s;e. This was a very different &s;ort of &s;en&s;ation from that which her marriage had occa&s;ioned; the one was painful and oppre&s;&s;ive, the other &s;o plea&s;ant, that, were it not for the efforts &s;he occa&s;ionally made, &s;he could have remained whole hours in that kind of gentle trance which the gue&s;ts of heaven only are &s;uppo&s;ed perfectly to enjoy.</P>
<P>In the&s;e happy occupations and &s;till happier dreams did winter glide away, for nothing makes time &s;o &s;hort as employing it well; and the return of &s;pring began to add to her plea&s;ures, which, however, were cruelly inter|rupted. Her good Mamma, who &s;o long had been lan|gui&s;hing, at la&s;t fell dangerou&s;ly ill. To know how &s;in|cerely &s;he was attached to the Canone&s;s, to expre&s;s the greatne&s;s of her fears, and to imagine all the duties, cares, and attentions &s;he paid her, one mu&s;t have the heart of Caroline. During her illne&s;s, which la&s;ted almo&s;t a month, &s;he never quitted her bed&s;ide, and it was with difficulty they could get her to repo&s;e a little while, oc|ca&s;ionally, in the &s;ame chamber. Let no one imagine that the fear of again falling into her father's or her hu&s;band's power, if her friend &s;hould die, occa&s;ioned this &s;evere grief. However natural &s;uch a thought might be, it ne|ver once entered her mind. Hara&s;&s;ed by apprehen&s;ion, ab&s;orbed in &s;orrow, wholly occupied by nur&s;ing, and &s;olacing, and &s;earing for her friend, Caroline never once thought of her&s;elf.</P>
<P>No; had it been nece&s;&s;ary, to re&s;tore life to the Ca|none&s;s, that Caroline mu&s;t have yielded hers to the Count, &s;he would not have he&s;itated a &s;ingle in&s;tant. But, hap|pily, to this cruel proof &s;he was not put.

le&s;s than the pre&s;criptions of the phy&s;ician; at lea&s;t, &s;o the Canone&s;s thought, and &s;o &s;aid, and therefore redoubled, if it were po&s;&s;ible, her former attachment to the lovely girl who gave &s;uch unequivocal proofs of af|fection.</P>
<P>During her illne&s;s &s;he received a vi&s;it from the High Chamberlain. Alarmed, as he prote&s;ted, at the dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his dear friend, he had flown to Rindaw. Some peo|ple have pretended this was not his motive, but that he had hoped to take back his daughter, and with her own con&s;ent. Continually controverted in all his &s;chemes, he, unfortunately, found the &s;ick lady &s;omewhat better, and the attentive Caroline never out of her &s;ight, never leaving her for a moment, more powerfully fixed at Rin|daw by her love for the Canone&s;s than even by her fear of the Count. This, certainly, was not the time to mention returning, nor yet the place; wherefore not a hint was dropped, nor was the name of Wal&s;tein once pronounced, who was &s;till at Peter&s;burg.</P>
<P>The Canone&s;s, indeed, would have pronounced it if &s;he could, that is, if &s;he had been able to expre&s;s all the indignation &s;he felt at this marriage; but alas! &s;he was too weak, &s;he only ju&s;t told the High Chamberlain that his daughter was an angel, that her life was pre&s;erved by her affection and care, and that &s;he would, therefore, con&s;ecrate her life to her happine&s;s. The Baron &s;oon departed, informing them he &s;hould pay them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;econd vi&s;it in autumn. It was then he expected the return of the Amba&s;&s;ador, and he told his daughter he hoped to find her perfectly rea&s;onable and prudent.</P>
<P>At any other time a vi&s;it from her father would have mo&s;t powerfully brought to mind what Caroline mo&s;t wi&s;h|ed to forget; but &s;he was then too much occupied by her cares for her friend, and had lately been too much agitated concerning her, to think of any thing el&s;e. Pre|&s;ent danger effaces, or, at lea&s;t&punc; or feebles the fear of future and Caroline was too happy to &s;ee the Canone&s;s recovering to imagine &s;he ever could be mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Not but that, at the Baron's departure, the autumnal vi&s;it he anounced with &s;o much &s;olemnity occa&s;ioned a kind of dread &s;he could not overcome; and, without re|membering the emotion &s;he might cau&s;e her convale&s;cent, &s;he fell on her neck, ki&s;&s;ed her checks, bathed them with her tears, and exclaimed, "O my dear, dear Mam|ma,
<PB N="34" REF="034126_0033_0FFA5609C9EF6560">
now you are re&s;tored to me, never will I leave you more, but live and die with you." Her friend, affected even to exce&s;s, returned her care&s;&s;es, and promi&s;ed that, if po&s;&s;ible, they would never &s;eparate.</P>
<P>The fear of the moment over, peace again took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul of Caroline. She pre&s;ently forgot the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tumnal vi&s;it which was at &s;o prodigious a di&s;tance. Is it for &s;ixteen to fear an evil &s;ix months before it &s;hall happen? Not to mention that &s;he had &s;omething el&s;e to do than think about any &s;uch thing. As &s;oon as the Canone&s;s was &s;ufficiently recovered, &s;he ran, morning and evening, about the garden, from flower to flower, and from arbour to arbour, enchanted and amazed at the progre&s;s which nature had made during her month's re|treat, that the &s;orrows of a &s;uffering friend had not con|tributed to enliven. Never before had the return of &s;pring made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon her; for, indeed, this was the fir&s;t time of her life &s;he had remarked and felt the growing charms of the reviving earth in all their infant varieties; then, when each returning day Nature a&s;&s;umes a newer, and &s;till a fre&s;her face; &s;till bequeaths other, and more abundant ble&s;&s;ings to man; and, with her pure breath, in&s;pires plea&s;ure, plenty, and gladne&s;s of heart!</P>
<P>What a contra&s;t, this, to the clo&s;e Chamber, the bed of pain, watered with tears, the di&s;tracting complaints of her dear friend, and the dread of being left de&s;olate; for, if her friend died, who &s;hould comfort Caroline! Yes, the&s;e mournful objects, the&s;e fearful apprehen&s;ions were exchanged for the cow&s;lip meadow, the budding grove, the lilac, the violet, honey&s;uccle, and the ro&s;e of May, to which &s;ucceeded the hyacinth, the ranunculous, the ane|mone, and the tulip, enamelling the earth and perfuming the air. At day-break was heard the warbling of ten thou|&s;and birds, and at the &s;etting &s;un the nightingale and the linnet again began their &s;ong, re&s;pon&s;ive from tree to tree, in &s;ounds melodious, wild, and &s;weet.</P>
<P>Nothing was indifferent to, nothing lo&s;t, nothing un|ob&s;erved by Caroline. She felt all, all enjoyed, enjoy|ed with rapture; believed &s;he inhabited an enchanted world, and her happine&s;s remained uninterrupted. The &s;ea&s;on, reviving to nature, gave new life and health al&s;o to her friend, and &s;he recovered rapidly. A weakne&s;s i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hams and a di&s;order of the eyes made her &s;till keep
<PB N="35" REF="034126_0034_0FFA54AF596F5658">
her chamber, but &s;he could breathe the pure air of &s;pring in the balcony; &s;he could &s;ee her Caroline cour&s;e along the gardens, collect the flowers, &s;upport tho&s;e that droop|ed, and water and pre&s;erve them from weeds; &s;he could hear her &s;weet voice mingle with the &s;ong of birds, and thus enjoyed the plea&s;ures and the &s;ports of Caroline.</P>
<P>Another very intere&s;ting incident was added to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rural happine&s;s of the youthful Counte&s;s. She wi&s;hed to rai&s;e &s;ome monument con&s;ecrated to her friend, and the happy epocha of her recovery. De&s;irous of cau&s;ing an agreeable &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he took advantage of the time during which the Canone&s;s was &s;till held reclu&s;e in her chamber, to erect a &s;mall temple without her knowledge. For which rea&s;on, &s;he cho&s;e her &s;pot in an angle of the garden, and at the far end of it, towards which the windows of the Canone&s;s did not look. On this &s;pot was a wild irregular arbour, full in foliage. The beech tree, the hazle, the woodbine, and the j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;amine, were there abundant; a|mong them the path that led to the arbour winded, and be&s;ide them a &s;mall clear bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k ran murmuring.</P>
<P>The Canone&s;s had planted this arbour during the time her unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion was at its height; the name of the per&s;idious High Chamberlain had been traced on every tree by her beauteous hand; and &s;he had always pre&s;erved her former predilection for this &s;pot, the &s;core of her &s;or|rows, her tenderne&s;s, and truth.</P>
<P>Caroline was plea&s;ed with it likewi&s;e; the thick &s;hrubs and uninterrupted &s;ecurity made it the delighted haunt of the red brea&s;t, the wren, the finch, and the linnet, and the Barone&s;s and Caroline had, many a &s;ummer, pa&s;&s;ed delicious moments amid the refre&s;hing foliage. At the farther end, of this favoured a&s;ylum did &s;he re&s;olve to erect the Temple of Friend&s;hip. Caroline informe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her father, &s;ecretly, of her project, which he willing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y for|warded by &s;ending her the nece&s;&s;ary workmen. A door which opened to the road gave them free egre&s;s and re|gre&s;s, without being perceived from the chateau, and Caroline was too great a favorite among the &s;ervants to fear their indi&s;cretion. The Canone&s;s, confined to her apartment, &s;u&s;pected nothing of all this; Caroline might, perhaps, have betrayed her&s;elf, had this happened &s;ix months &s;ooner, but &s;he had learned to keep one &s;ecret, and the &s;econd was certainly far le&s;s burthen&s;ome. Nei|ther care, a&s;&s;iduity, nor money were wanting; her zeal
<PB N="36" REF="034126_0035_0FFA561DC089AA30">
communicated it&s;elf to the workmen; &s;he furni&s;hed ideas, drew plans, and was always the fir&s;t in the morning at the building, which went forward with exce&s;&s;ive rapi|dity, and which was fini&s;hed in le&s;s than a month.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the temple was ready for the reception of her friend, &s;he was mo&s;t earne&s;t in her entreaties to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here. "The air of your arbour, Mamma, is &s;o cool, &s;o refre&s;hing, &s;o pure, the foliage is &s;o abundant, and the flowers &s;o &s;weet, you will be delighted."</P>
<P>"I have no doubt of it, my dear, but thou knowe&s;t I cannot walk &s;o far."</P>
<P>"If that be all, I will carry you thither, my&s;elf, Mam|ma."</P>
<P>Caroline was &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, that the Canone&s;s, who could deny her nothing, &s;uffered her&s;elf, at la&s;t, to be carried in her arm-chair, and was well rewarded for her conde|&s;cen&s;ion, by the &s;urpri&s;e, the plea&s;ure, and the new mark of affection thus te&s;tified by her adopted daughter.</P>
<P>This little temple, or pavilion, was an octagon; the architecture was exceedingly &s;imple. Eight columns of white &s;tucco left an open &s;pace, which was paved in Mo|&s;aic, with black and white marble. In the middle was an altar of white marble ornamented with fe&s;toons of mo&s;t elegant &s;culpture; upon the altar &s;tood a bu&s;t of the Ca|none&s;s, modelled after an exceedingly good portrait in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Caroline. In her youth &s;he had been beautiful; and, when the High Chamberlain was her lo|ver, he had more than one rival. It gave her plea&s;ure often to remark, that &s;he was thought greatly to re&s;emble the &s;tatue of Cleopatra. Though grief and years had &s;tolen the ro&s;es from her cheeks, and de&s;troyed &s;omewhat of this re&s;emblance, her features were &s;till &s;ufficiently regu|lar for a very agreeable bu&s;t.</P>
<P>Caroline was very de&s;irous of engraving &s;ome ver&s;es on the ba&s;e of the altar, indicating to whom it was con&s;ecra|ted: but, as &s;he determined not to borrow, it was nece&s;|&s;ary to write them her&s;elf; and, as the talent of poetry is not, however it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, intuitive, but requires long application and &s;evere &s;tudy before it can be good, Caroline was not a good poet. She made the attempt, however; for when the feelings are &s;trong and the ideas flowing in abundance, the expre&s;&s;ion of them &s;eems, be|fore trial, to be exceedingly ea&s;y; but, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> made, is found to be exactly the rever&s;e.

and effaced, interlined, tore, began again, and, at la&s;t, wrote &s;ome ver&s;es, which might be, once, heard with plea&s;ure, but which did not de&s;erve to be engraved in marble. At fir&s;t &s;he was enchanted with them, but pre|&s;ently recoiled at recollecting they &s;hould always remain there, and would be read by every one. Renouncing poetical &s;ame, therefore, &s;he cau&s;ed a &s;imple in&s;criptio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in letters of gold, to be written, beneath the bu&s;t, indi|cating the day, the month, and the year in which the Canone&s;s was &s;natched from the grave, her&s;elf re&s;tored to happine&s;s, and this Temple dedicated to Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>A double &s;tair ca&s;e of white marble led to an upper apartment of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions and form with that be|neath, that is to &s;ay octagonal, but walled in and lighted by four large windows. The ceiling was a lofty dome, painted with &s;uch art that it perfectly imitated a mo&s;t &s;e|rene and cry&s;tal &s;ky. Round the walls, between the windows, were paintings, emblematic of the per&s;on to whom the temple was dedicated. In one of the partitions was Caroline, kneeling to E&s;culapius, ardently invoking his aid, and pointing to her expiring friend. In the &s;econd Caroline was a&s;&s;i&s;ting her as &s;he ro&s;e, while little Genii &s;ported around her, &s;cattered flowers, over&s;et the table on which phials and phy&s;ical remedies were placed, and broke the javelin of Death who was &s;een flying in the back ground. In the third a pavilion was building, Caro|line placing the bu&s;t upon the altar, and the Genii of friend&s;hip and gratitude engraving the in&s;cription. In the fourth and la&s;t, Caroline was leading, and &s;u&s;taining with one arm, the Canone&s;s, who&s;e attitude expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e and joy, and extending the other towards the temple &s;he had been building, and which &s;he there pre|&s;ented to her.</P>
<P>The partitions were wain&s;cot, and had doors, behind each of which was a rece&s;s for a &s;mall library; a table &s;tood in the middle, and cabriole chairs round the room.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, nothing was forgotten, yet all was planned and conducted by a young girl of &s;ixteen; but this girl was in&s;pired and informed by friend&s;hip: her heart over|flowing with this affection, and, totally ignorant of any other, loving by nature, without other object of attach|ment than this her dear and only friend, to her the effu|&s;ions of &s;en&s;ibility were all directed, and the dread of lo|&s;ing her had rendered them &s;till more creative, more pow|erful,

and more profu&s;e. Genius likewi&s;e begins to &s;how it&s;elf at her age, and the mind and imagination have then an ardor that mu&s;t find employment, a fire that will have fuel. Independent of the plea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould give her friend, that which pertained to her&s;elf, alone, was far from &s;mall. To build was in &s;ome &s;ort to create, each new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was a new enjoyment, the execution and the effect of which gave her momentary rapture. Caroline, perhaps, never enjoyed greater felicity than while &s;he was thus employed; &s;o has &s;he &s;ince frequently acknowledged, and never, afterwards, beheld this monument of affection and friend&s;hip, without emotion.</P>
<P>Let the reader, if the reader can, imagine the ec&s;tacy of the &s;entimental Barone&s;s. It was the denouement of a romance, an incident of &s;urpri&s;e &s;o unexpected, and &s;o perfectly conformable to her ideas and ta&s;te, that it &s;eemed imagined and contrived purpo&s;ely for her&mdash;a tem|ple built by enchantment by the wand of a Fairy, or the tali&s;man of a Genius. Behold her cla&s;ping the lovely Sylph in her arms to whom &s;he is indebted for this pro|digy! and lo! Caroline kneeling, ki&s;&s;ing her hands, and expre&s;&s;ing her multitudinous &s;en&s;ations by looks and &s;i|lence incapable of &s;peech! &s;ee them mingle their tears, each contending for &s;uperior gratitude and love!</P>
<P>This was the moment in which Caroline felt happi|ne&s;s unmixed, free from the &s;lighte&s;t &s;hade of pain, and as pure as it was innocent. Happy age! exi&s;ting but for the pre&s;ent moment, forgetful of the pa&s;t, and regardle&s;s of the future! Rindaw was the world to Caroline, and her pavilion the Temple of Felicity. So enamoured was &s;he of it, that &s;he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ed her whole time there, when &s;he was not with her friend. The moment &s;he left the Ba|rone&s;s &s;he &s;lew to the pavilion, and &s;he &s;carcely could quit it without regret. The lofty dome was mo&s;t excel|lently adapted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the &s;ound was echoed, lengthen|ed and increa&s;ed; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cordingly, all the in&s;truments were carried thithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that, pre&s;ently, it was impo&s;&s;ible to play or &s;ing any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but in the pavilion.</P>
<P>The clear light was equally excellent for drawing; for, by means of the four windows and Venetian blind, the light might be di&s;po&s;ed in what manner the painter plea|&s;ed; and pencils, ballets and colours were all tran&s;ported thither.</P>
<P>The place was &s;o tranquil, &s;o undi&s;turbed &s;o free from
<PB N="39" REF="034126_0038_0FFA19F8F07D48C8">
noi&s;e and interruption, that it was the propere&s;t in the world for reading, and Caroline's whole library &s;tole thither by degrees. Caroline &s;carcely had any other a|partment; &s;he never entered her own room, except to &s;leep, or ha&s;tily arrange her dre&s;s, and often in that of her dear mamma &s;he felt a kind of impatience to be gone. Novelty is a plea&s;ure which habit &s;oon renders ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Let us, however, do ju&s;tice to Caroline. She was all impatience that her friend &s;hould &s;o far recover her &s;trength as daily to come and live with her in her dear pavilion and &s;o charmed was the Barone&s;s to &s;ee Caroline thus happy, that &s;he contributed every thing in her pow|er to continue the &s;weet delirium. How long it was to continue, how long &s;he was to love her pavilion for it&s;elf alone, we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee.</P>
<P>Hitherto, the tranquil exi&s;tence of Caroline has glided away untroubled in its progre&s;s, except the now forgot|ten week at Berlin, unmole&s;ted by love or hatred; for her repugnance to Wal&s;tein, her dread of living with him, was not hatred; and if, by chance, &s;he thought of him, the remembrance in&s;pired gratitude for the pre|&s;ent liberty in which &s;he lived. But this was, indeed, a kind of chance that &s;eldom happened; &s;eldom, indeed, did the recollection of the Count intrude it&s;elf, and the enjoyment of pre&s;ent plea&s;ures effaced his image from her mind almo&s;t to total forgetfulne&s;s. Her freedom &s;he en|joyed as though it had been ab&s;olute, and did not ill re|&s;emble a bird &s;ecured by a thread winging the air, warbling, and fancying it&s;elf as free as the feathered &s;ong&s;ters that vault from bu&s;h to bu&s;h: its forgotten captivity is not perceived till the hand that retains it draws gently back, catches, and carefully again inclo&s;es it within the cage.</P>
<P>Caroline had lately received &s;ome new mu&s;ic from Ber|lin; among it was a collection of lyric compo&s;itions, &s;ome of which &s;he was delighted with, and one in particular. The air &s;uited her voice, and the words her feelings; &s;he &s;ang it from morning to night, accompanying her&s;elf al|ternately on the guitar, the harp, and the piano forte, and each time of repeating it, finding a wi&s;h and a plea|&s;ure to repeat it again.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to this our hi&s;tory that we &s;hould in&s;ert this &s;ong and, perhaps, our readers will not be di&s;plea|&s;ed to &s;ee words that gave Caroline &s;o much delight.</P>

<P>The accent, the voice, the expre&s;&s;ion, were very dif|ferent from the ru&s;tic &s;ongs to which &s;he was accu&s;tomed, and gave her infinite &s;urpri&s;e. She left &s;inging, li&s;tened, but heard the voice no more; &s;he then again began to &s;ing, but in a &s;ofter tone, and an accompaniment le&s;s loud; and di&s;tinctly heard, as &s;he wi&s;hed, the voice once more. With her guitar in her hand, &s;he ran towards the ca&s;ement to look towards the high road, where &s;he &s;aw a youth, beauteous, finely formed, and arrived at full manhood, in a hunting dre&s;s, leaning on his fowling-piece, with his eyes fixed on the temple.

He then beheld a charming virgin approach the window, and it was very natural he &s;hould look at her. What, in|deed, could be more natural? And yet was Caroline oc|cupied, the whole day, by reflecting on the&s;e incidents, as if they had been the mo&s;t extraordinary po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We own that to Caroline, who &s;aw each &s;ucceeding day but like the day before, a common incident might &s;eem &s;trange, and any being who &s;hould interrupt &s;olitude, &s;o continued and &s;o ab&s;olute as her's, might well appear &s;ingular. Of this youth, therefore, &s;he often thought, and as often wondered who he might be, or why he &s;hould travel a road where beings like him&s;elf were &s;o &s;eldom &s;een. Of the&s;e her cogitations, however, &s;he &s;aid not a word; for &s;he felt &s;ome vague idea of dread le&s;t her dear pavilion &s;hould become an interdicted place, and this, to her, would have been wor&s;e than death.</P>
<P>On the morrow, therefore, &s;he flew with more early ha&s;te even than u&s;ual, and, after having po&s;&s;ed an hour, looking through the window towards the road, and well a&s;&s;uring her&s;elf, by examining every way, that no one could either &s;ee or hear her, &s;he took her guitar, &s;at down with the &s;a&s;h thrown up, and &s;ang her favourite &s;ong from beginning to end; and, though &s;he always had liked the la&s;t ver&s;e the lea&s;t, it this time &s;o far took her fancy that it was repeated: &s;he next &s;ung it to her harp, and after|wards to her piano forte. At this, however, &s;he did not long remain; for it &s;tood at the far end of the pavilion, and Caroline found the air &s;o pure, &s;o mild, &s;o refre&s;hing, that &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;it any where but at the win|dow. She had written down the &s;econd that &s;he had heard, and repeated in every kind of mode
<Q><L>Yes, dear Indiff'rence, thee I know</L>
<L>The friend of bli&s;s, and not the foe;</L></Q>
which, alas! no one came to contradict.</P>
<P>Tired, at length, and, for aught we know, &s;omewhat chagrined to &s;ing &s;o long by her&s;elf when there were peo|ple in the world who &s;o harmoniou&s;ly could bear a part, &s;he threw down her mu&s;ic, laid by her in&s;trument, ran in|to the garden, plucked &s;ome flowers which &s;he to&s;&s;ed with|out order into her flower-ba&s;ket, and, for want of other amu&s;ement, again returned to the pavilion, took up her

pallet and her pencil, and carele&s;sly began to imitate the tints and beauties &s;he had been collecting. It was with difficulty, at fir&s;t, &s;he could any way fix her attention, and &s;he looked oftener toward the window than the pan|nel on which &s;he painted; but her work by degrees drew her attention, and wholly occupied her. The flowers, which from her traces took birth, plea&s;ed her; each new touch was happy, and gave a new effect; the powers of genius were rou&s;ed and high in action when, &s;uddenly, the clattering of a hor&s;e's h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s were heard at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This noi&s;e, though of a very different nature, was lit|tle le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing than the melodious &s;ounds of the even|ing before; it bore no re&s;emblance to the &s;low and heavy &s;tep of the bea&s;t of burden or the village hor&s;e. Accord|ingly, the pencil was thrown by, and Caroline, in a mo|ment, was at the window, looking every way. She pre|&s;ently beheld, and not far di&s;tant, a fine hand&s;ome man, mounted on a gray hor&s;e that champed the bit he &s;eemed to di&s;dain, and foaming obeyed the re&s;training hand of his graceful rider.</P>
<P>How ob&s;ervant, how piercing, how exact is the female eye! Scarcely had Caroline &s;een the &s;tranger of over-night&punc; who was in a green &s;porting dre&s;s; the pre&s;ent youth wore a uniform; the one was on foot, the other on hor&s;e|back; the fir&s;t &s;ung, the latter galloped. How little did the&s;e things re&s;emble each other! and yet did Caroline, in&s;tantly, recollect the&s;e two to be one and the &s;ame per|&s;on. It was not po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t that curio&s;ity that de&s;i|red to know if this youth could ride as well as he could &s;ing. He, or rather his hor&s;e, advanced, for the proud animal was difficult to detain, and not ea&s;y to manage; yet was he forgotten the moment his rider had a glance of Caroline; the hand quitted the bridle for the hat (for what cavalier would forbear to &s;alute an angelic creature who appeared to be the godde&s;s of the temple?) and the impatient &s;teed, profiting by momentary liberty, and, per|haps, &s;omewhat frightened at the &s;udden motion of the rider, gave a prodigious plunge, which would have un|hor&s;ed a rider le&s;s firm and daring, and &s;et off, full &s;peed, regardle&s;s of every effort of the cavalier, and quick as lightning, was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Caroline, greatly terrified, gave a piercing &s;hriek, and followed the hor&s;e and his rider with looks of anxiety and dread as long as &s;he could, which, however, was but a mo|ment;
<PB N="44" REF="034126_0043_0FFA56650C72D420">
they were gone, but her fears remained, and again, and ardently, &s;he looked, though nothing was there to be &s;een. Fear, like other beings, propogates and multiplies, and Caroline &s;aw the noble cavalier falling from his hor&s;e, rolled in the du&s;t, wounded and trampled on.&mdash;If the dangerous bea&s;t would but run towards the village, he might there, perhaps, be &s;topped, the people might come to his ma&s;ter's aid, and they might bring him back, if wounded, to the chateau. For a moment &s;he thought to have &s;ent the &s;ervants after him, but after whom? She her&s;elf knew not. And which road? for there were &s;e|veral at leaving the village. Be&s;ides, it was not ea&s;y to overtake a hor&s;e full &s;peed. And then how could &s;he give the&s;e orders? It &s;eemed &s;o particular, at lea&s;t &s;o &s;he feared it would &s;eem. No, &s;he never could re&s;olve, and, therefore, remain &s;he mu&s;t with all her anxious in|quietudes.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;he endeavoured to calm by recollecting how firm, how graceful the officer &s;at, and how certain he &s;eemed of his power before that vexatious &s;alutation, for which &s;he wholly reproached her&s;elf; having no other per&s;on to &s;alute, &s;he hoped the hor&s;e would lo&s;e his fears, and the cavalier regain his command; and even that &s;he &s;hould be happy enough to &s;ee him again on the morrow; "and really," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "he ought to come merely to quiet my apprehen&s;ions."</P>
<P>The agitation of Caroline had totally deprived her of any de&s;ire any longer to &s;ing or paint; &s;o, after a few turns in the garden, &s;till thinking on the youth who, like an apparition, had twice &s;uddenly appeared, and twice as &s;uddenly vani&s;hed, &s;he returned to keep the Barone&s;s company; to whom, however, &s;he did not mention a &s;yllable of what had happened; fearing, no doubt, to terrify her as much as &s;he had been terrified her&s;elf. She went to bed impatiently wi&s;hing for the morrow, and ardently hoping &s;he &s;hould either &s;ee the &s;tranger, or, at lea&s;t, be certified he had e&s;caped un|hurt. Ye&s;terday, &s;imple and pure curio&s;ity had engaged her to think of him; to-day, humanity was added&punc; for the life of a man was endangered. After many reflec|tions on the &s;ubject, and after being very angry with un|ruly hor&s;es, that will not &s;uffer cavaliers to be polite, and take off their hats to ladies, Caroline, at la&s;t, fell a&s;leep.</P>

Caroline, baulked in all her expectations, &s;ound the day intolerably tedious, and, tired, and vexed to death, could find no mode plea|&s;antly to employ her time; her books, her mu&s;ic, her drawings, all were at the pavilion; her heart was at the pavilion, al&s;o, and &s;he her&s;elf mo&s;t impatiently wi&s;hed to be there, but, ah! it was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ations with her dear Mamma, concerning rain and fine weather, and mo&s;t &s;incere wi&s;hes for the return of the latter, &s;inging the burthen of <HI>Peaceful Indifference,</HI> and imagining the &s;econd, remembering the galloping hor&s;e, and again hoping for the morrow, where the be&s;t means Caroline could find of pa&s;&s;ing the day. The mor|row&mdash;why this good for nothing morrow was as bad as the former one; the rain was wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and the clouds &s;eemed all to have made an appointment to meet at Rindaw. It was too much for nature to bear, and Caro|line, for the fir&s;t time in her life, was really out of tem|per, and &s;hewed &s;he was &s;o. "Is it not intolerable, Mamma, that one cannot &s;o much as &s;tep into the pavili|on? There is my flower-ba&s;ket, which I had begun to paint!

<P>Alas! poor Caroline! the thorns already are in thy heart; thy gaiety, before &s;o uniform, is now no more; that cheerful void of care, happily improvident, which gave thee &s;miles and &s;ongs, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th the gloomy as the golden and the azure &s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e are fled.</P>

The di&s;appointment of the time pa&s;t augmented the plea&s;ure of the time pre&s;ent, and &s;carcely would &s;he wait till the path was dry before &s;he flew to the pavilion.</P>
<P>Not her flowers, &s;o much regretted, not her books, for which &s;he &s;eemed to &s;igh, nor yet her mu&s;ic, which might enliven the dulne&s;s of dark and cloudy weather, were the things that fir&s;t drew her attention: it was the window and the road, uniform and inanimate as &s;uch objects may &s;eem, that attracted and riveted the eyes of Caroline. She looks this way, that way, and every way; &s;he li&s;tens and fears to breathe; yet nothing &s;ees, nothing hears; &s;he examines the humid green &s;werd, and the gravel-path, trying if &s;he can di&s;cover the new-made traces of a hor&s;e's hoof. "Ah! could I only know he had pa&s;&s;ed this way, that he were &s;afe, that no accident had happened, how tranquil, how perfectly contented &s;hould I be! For, cer|tainly, I was the cau&s;e of his misfortune. If I had left the window, he would not have pulled off his hat, and his hor&s;e would not have been frightened; but only let me get the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of him once again, and I will withdraw in&s;tantly, that he no more may be tempted to &s;alute me." Thus to her&s;elf &s;aid Caroline.</P>
<P>Now, &s;o it happened, ju&s;t as thus &s;he had &s;aid, &s;he not only had a glimp&s;e, but a full view of a caval<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, wearing the &s;ame uniform, mounted on the &s;ame gray, unruly hor&s;e, and advancing, full trot, towards the pavilion, from which he was as yet at &s;ome di&s;tance. Well then, there he was, &s;afe and unhurt, and Caroline, <HI>no doubt,</HI> was made per|fectly ea&s;y; and, <HI>no doubt,</HI> &s;he will retire, as &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf, and think of him no more.</P>
<P>But wherefore the tremor which &s;uddenly has &s;eized her? Wherefore this quickening pul&s;e, this palpitating heart, this &s;preading &s;uffu&s;ion that dyes alaba&s;ter &s;carlet, and gives the ro&s;e of the cheek a deeper hue? I know not wherefore the&s;e things were; I only know they were, and that Caroline was all agitation. She was going to leave the window, but ju&s;t at that moment, for things will &s;ome|times happen oddly, her handkerchief, on which &s;he had been leaning, fell, and was borne (no doubt by Zephyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for they are apt at wanton and malicious tricks), yes, it was borne into the middle of the highway.</P>
<P>Caroline was ab&s;olutely in de&s;pair: the act was mo&s;t &s;urely involuntary, yet &s;o it might not &s;eem; not forget|ting that this was &s;till more dangerous to the cavalier than
<PB N="47" REF="034126_0046_0FFA55004DC72150">
the &s;alute &s;he meant to avoid; for it is certainly le&s;s dif|ficult to take off one's hat, on hor&s;eback, than to pick up a handkerchief from the ground. This was a very ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, but &s;o was not the next &s;he made; &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed the cavalier &s;till &s;o far di&s;tant as to give her time to run down, open the pavilion door, &s;ally forth, pick up her handkerchief, and re-enter before he &s;hould arrive. The idea &s;he thought excellent, it &s;eemed to be the only po&s;&s;ible expedient of clearly demon&s;trating that the hand|kerchief had not been purpo&s;ely thrown out of the win|dow for the cavalier to pick up; nor was there time to lo&s;e in reflection; away, therefoer, &s;he flew to the door, opened it, and was &s;tepping out at the very moment that the young officer, after alighting from his hor&s;e, was him|&s;elf in the act of taking up the handkerchief.</P>
<P>With a graceful and dignified manner the youth ap|proached, and, in an elegant compliment returned his prize; while Caroline, di&s;concerted and unable to reply, extended her timid hand. The youth, with infinite mo|de&s;ty, begged permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee the garden and pavilion, which, he &s;aid, appeared mo&s;t charming. Under&s;tanding the &s;ilence of the trembling Caroline as con&s;ent (cavaliers will &s;o under&s;tand), he pre&s;ently hung the bridle of his hor&s;e to the pavilion door, and followed her.</P>
<P>The latent feelings of Caroline told her &s;he ought to have denied his reque&s;t; but which way? Caroline was naturally all benevolence, and there is &s;omething pain|ful in denial. Neither did &s;he perceive any infinite evil which could thence re&s;ult. Her own innocence, her to|tal ignorance of the world, concealed the danger that might lurk thus under the form of a youthful &s;oldier. Be&s;ide, his uniform &s;poke him a gentleman, and the no|ble ea&s;e of his manner of no mean birth: his politene&s;s was &s;o natural, &s;o graceful, &s;o familiar, the tone of his voice, his mode&s;t confidence, all confirmed him perfectly well bred. The &s;ymmetry and beauty of his form made not all that impre&s;&s;ion which might naturally be expect|ed, becau&s;e Caroline dur&s;t not look at him; and yet &s;he had &s;een &s;ufficient to find that his full fine eyes were mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ively intelligent, and &s;he very &s;oon could have informed us that his teeth were white and regular, his &s;mile enchanting, his no&s;e acquiline, his vi&s;age oval, his eyebrows markingly arched, his &s;tature tall, his dark com|plexion animated by the warm glow of youth and health,
<PB N="48" REF="034126_0047_0FFA56878B41E988">
and that his open and frank countenance in&s;pired confi|dence and friend&s;hip the moment they were beheld. All the&s;e things had the furtive beauteous Counte&s;s pre&s;ently remarked. This might, perhaps, in part, excu&s;e that &s;a|cility with which &s;he &s;uffered him to walk up into the pavilion; unle&s;s it &s;hould be thought more natural to ca&s;t the whole blame on ab&s;olute Innocence, too &s;ecure in its own &s;implicity. But whether this or that excu&s;e were be&s;t, there he is, there looks, there admires, there prai&s;es with ec&s;tacy, and yet with propriety, void of exaggera|tion, the ta&s;te and the talents which had decorated the temple. The altar and paintings particularly fixed his attention. He a&s;ked an explanation; it was given, and thus he gained a happy opportunity of learning to whom the place belonged without the indelicacy of interrogation, though neither the names of the Barone&s;s of Rindaw or the High Chamberlain Lichtfield made him more polite, more attentive, or more re&s;pectful; for that was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The &s;ong and the guitar were lying on the piano forte, which, with a gentle but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;mile, led him to mention the &s;econd, and to a&s;k pardon for that teme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity which had &s;uffered him to mingle his voice with the har|monious &s;ounds he had heard, and which, he added, he &s;hould be mo&s;t happy again to hear. He &s;aw the propo|&s;ition augmented the confu&s;ion of Caroline; he &s;aid not a word more concerning it, therefore; but &s;poke of mu&s;ic, its effects and charms, like one who felt them, and was the fir&s;t to propo&s;e quitting the pavilion and walking in the garden.</P>
<P>The fortitude of Caroline began to return: the &s;tran|ger's conver&s;ation was &s;o agreeable, &s;o unaffected, and yet &s;o animated, that it could not long leave her under any con&s;traint; and, after a turn or two in the garden, Caro|line &s;poke to him as naturally as if they had been acquaint|ed all their lives. With the mo&s;t perfect &s;implicity did &s;he relate the terror with which &s;he had been &s;eized at the impetuo&s;ity of the unmanageable hor&s;e, and tell all her fears and apprehen&s;ions during tho&s;e two dreadful days of rain. De&s;irous, however, as &s;he was to learn the name of the cavalier, this was a thing &s;he dur&s;t not a&s;k; &s;he only under&s;tood he was captain in the guards, and her country neighbour, which both gave her plea&s;ure; for the one informed her he was a proper vi&s;itor, and the other that &s;he &s;hould certainly &s;ee him again.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="034126_0048_0FFA55106C68A318">A quarter of an hour, which, &s;hort as it was, &s;eemed &s;till infinitely &s;horter, they thus conver&s;ed; when the &s;teed, neighing and pawing at the door, became &s;o impa|tient that his ma&s;ter was obliged, however unwilling, a|gain to mount. "Really," &s;aid Caroline to him as he threw the bridle over his neck, "were I in your place, Sir, I &s;hould not like a hor&s;e that would neither permit one to take off one's hat nor walk in a garden."&mdash;Ah! how in|finite are the charms of Innocence! The &s;tranger with a &s;mile half re&s;trained, a&s;&s;ured Caroline his hor&s;e &s;hould be better taught, and that, indeed, he had played him to many malicious tricks, of which he &s;hould be corrected; then, lightly vaulting into the &s;addle, after a thou&s;and repeated thanks to Caroline for her conde&s;cen&s;ion, he departed, as &s;lowly as po&s;&s;ible, curbing the haughty ani|mal to obedience. Caroline, as &s;lowly, returned to the pavilion, as &s;oon, that is, as he was out of fight; her head, aye and her heart too, wholly occupied by the departed cavalier.</P>
<P>"How amiable his per&s;on! how &s;oft, how attentive his manners! Oh that Heaven had given me a brother like him! How dearly would he have been beloved!&mdash; But wherefore may I not love this youth as I &s;hould love a brother, or as a friend, &s;ent by Heaven to make &s;oli|tude cheerful? Yet how do I know if ever I &s;hall be|hold him again?"</P>
<P>Thus meditated Caroline; and what the thought was which, added to this latter, &s;o might move her we know not, but Caroline felt a &s;udden oppre&s;&s;ion at her heart, and the tear ro&s;e gli&s;tening in her eye. Sen&s;ible of this, and &s;omewhat alarmed, &s;he was de&s;irous to divert her at|tention to other objects, and &s;at down to her mu&s;ic; but the two days rain had put her harp and guitar out of tune, and &s;he was obliged to lay them by; the piano forte was le&s;s affected, and &s;he played an adagio, which but augment|ed melancholy. To painting &s;he had next recour&s;e, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s; and reading was &s;till lets amu&s;ing than either: &s;he opened books, but they &s;eemed dull and ill written before &s;he had fini&s;hed a period. Some change mu&s;t certainly have taken place, for objects that before gave plea&s;ure, at pre&s;ent gave di&s;tate, or painful la&s;&s;itude at be&s;t.</P>
<P>Caroline returned to the garden, and took the &s;ame
<PB N="50" REF="034126_0049_0FFA569785D91200">
round &s;he lately had gone with the cavalier, &s;topped at the &s;ame places, and recollected every expre&s;&s;ion, every at|titude, and every look. The grand que&s;tion now remain|ed to be determined; that is to &s;ay, whether &s;he &s;hould or &s;hould not, tell all that had happened to the good Ca|none&s;s. Silence was di&s;agreeable, and to my&s;tery Caroline was naturally aver&s;e; yet &s;he &s;eemed more aver&s;e to &s;peak or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> occa&s;ion. She knew not how to &s;peak, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k; and, &s;uppo&s;ing there to be nothing wrong in keeping the &s;ecret, there was nothing difficult in it; for &s;ecrecy was, at pre&s;ent become habitual, and &s;he her|&s;elf, it may be, le&s;s communicative. Be&s;ide, what &s;hould &s;he &s;ay? "Why mention a per&s;on, whom, perhaps, I &s;hall never &s;ee again, who&s;e name I know not? It will be time enough if he &s;hould return. And then &s;hould the Baro|ne&s;s blame me for having admitted him into the garden, forbid me the pavilion, and not &s;uffer me any more to look out of the window!"</P>
<P>Caroline half &s;huddered, as thus &s;he meditated, and re|&s;olved not to tell what had happened. When, however, &s;he returned to her friend, &s;he could not forbear a&s;king a thou&s;and que&s;tions concerning the neighbourhood, for two leagues round. As the Canone&s;s never was vi&s;ited, Caro|line knew none of the neighbour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, nor had &s;he ever, be|fore, made the lea&s;t enquiry; though her good friend made a merit of knowing the genealogy of all their fami|lies through every branch. To que&s;tion her concerning the characters and affairs of her neighbours was taking her on her weak &s;ide; and poor Caroline had a hundred hi&s;|tories to hear, while the only on to which &s;he could have li&s;tened with plea&s;ure was unrelated. Not the lea&s;t cir|cum&s;tance could &s;he learn that had any reference to the &s;tranger. Here lived an old Baron who had retired from the army, with his wife as old as him&s;elf, &s;hut up in their chateau; there a young couple, with &s;everal children, but they were infants, and all girls. Yonder, as you en|tered the village, an ancient commander of the Teutonic Order; very infirm, very avaricious, and on very good terms with his gouvernante. A little farther, an old dowager, with an only &s;on of five and twenty.</P>
<P>Caroline, who was half a&s;leep, no &s;ooner heard of the only &s;on of five and twenty, than &s;he was as perfectly a|wake as ever &s;he had been in her life; but to little purpo&s;e
<PB N="51" REF="034126_0050_0FFA57A4700E3348">
half an ideot, with no other employment that what hunt|ing and drinking afforded, and who, notwith&s;tanding his great riches, could pur&s;uade no woman to become his wife. Ah! thought Caroline, that is not my cavalier.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s continued, for it was not ea&s;y to inter|rupt her, and &s;he was inexhau&s;tible. At la&s;t Caroline, quite wearied, and learning nothing of what &s;he mo&s;t de&s;i|red to know, wi&s;hing to be alone, took advantage of a &s;light head-ach, and retired &s;ooner than u&s;ual. "He is not my neighbour, then," &s;aid &s;he &s;ighing. "And has he deceived, could he deceive me? If &s;o, I &s;hall never &s;ee him more. Well then I mu&s;t forget, never think of him more."</P>
<P>Moncrief has &s;aid that the very act of determining to forget makes us remember. Thus, Caroline, fortifying her&s;elf in this her noble re&s;olution, forget the cav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lier by recollecting every word that had pa&s;&s;ed; and, thus rumi|nating, dropt a&s;leep. No doubt the project of thinking on him no more was her fir&s;t on waking the next morn|ing. She ro&s;e, and re&s;olved not to go to the pavilion all the forenoon: habit was very &s;trong, and was with dif|ficulty vanqui&s;hed, yet vanqui&s;hed it was: &s;he rai&s;ed her drooping flowers, examined her aviary, and &s;at down to her embroidery, every moment repeating, "I mu&s;t think of him no more," and as often looking towards the pa|vilion. "Dear pavilion&punc;" &s;aid Caroline, &s;ighing, "I am never happy but when I am there; I mu&s;t pay it a vi&s;it, but it &s;hall be very very late, when I am &s;ure no per&s;on is walking. I will not go, at &s;oone&s;t, before four o'clock in the afternoon."</P>
<P>The day appeared exceedingly long, and Caroline per&s;uaded her&s;elf it was already far advanced, as &s;he &s;auntered near the pavilion, when &s;he heard, in the very court-yard of the chateau, the trampling of a hor&s;e and the &s;ound of hoofs &s;he began to think &s;he recollected, which made her heart palpitate. In a moment a &s;ervant enters and announces the Baron of Lindorf. The a&s;to|ni&s;hed Barone&s;s recollects to have heard the name, and gives orders for his admi&s;&s;ion; when the charming &s;tranger of the pavilion, with all his grace and gentle|ne&s;s, appeared.</P>
<P>Poor Caroline, what was thy emotion! How bitterly&punc; did&s;t thou reproach thy&s;elf for not having mentioned him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> friend! How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are thy blu&s;hes at thy
<PB N="52" REF="034126_0051_0FFA56A6A6264FC8">
own di&s;&s;imulation! For, whether he &s;peak or whether he do not, thou art, equally, afraid of his indi&s;cretion and his &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Lindorf cho&s;e the latter; a glance at Caroline, who, tremblingly confu&s;ed, alternately pale and red, had cour|te&s;ied to him with downca&s;t eyes and timidity in every feature, in a moment informed him how it was proper to act. He returned her &s;alutation as if it had been the fir&s;t time he had &s;een her; and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Ca|none&s;s, congratulated him&s;elf on the happine&s;s of being her neighbour, with &s;elf-reproaches for not having &s;ooner profited by this advantage.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s, to whom this youthful cavalier was a to|tal &s;tranger, a&s;ked an explanation, and learned that the commander of the Teutonic Order had, like her&s;elf been ill, but had not, like her, recovered; for he was lately dead, and the Baron of Lindorf, his nephew and heir, was come to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the man&s;ion and e&s;tate of Ri&s;berg, which was adjoining to the Barony of Rindaw. He had at fir&s;t intended not to make a long &s;tay, but the country had plea&s;ed him infinitely; and he had very lately come to a re&s;olution to pa&s;s the remainder of the &s;ummer there. His fir&s;t wi&s;h was to be acquainted with his lovely neighbours, to pre&s;ent them his duty and his homage, and to &s;olicit permi&s;&s;ion the&s;e occa&s;ionally to renew.</P>
<P>All this was &s;aid looking towards Caroline, who, with her eyes fixed on her work, which &s;he was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;poiling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt a profound &s;ilence. Thanks, however, to the good Canone&s;s, the conver&s;ation was not therefore interrupted; &s;he gave the hi&s;tory of her whole illne&s;s, then reverted with great pity, to that of the Commander, and lamented his death, of which &s;he had been wholly ignorant. "It was but ye&s;terday," &s;aid &s;he, "I menti|oned him to Caroline, who had a&s;ked me who were my neighbours."</P>
<P>Lindorf did not recollect him&s;elf &s;oon enough totally to &s;uppre&s;s a &s;mile, and Caroline was ab&s;olutely ready to faint with &s;hame and vexation.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s proceeded with compliments to the heir, and enquiries concerning the e&s;tate and property, which mu&s;t from the character of the Commander, be con&s;ider|able. After which came interrogatories concerning the degree of kindred in which the decea&s;ed and the youth
<PB N="53" REF="034126_0052_0FFA1B0DD5B02F60">
&s;tood, all which &s;he an&s;wered her&s;elf. "Oh! I am ac|quainted with every branch of the family. Your name is Lindorf, is it not? Yes, yes, your name is Lindorf; and you inherit in right of my Lady, your mother. She, yes, &s;he was Barone&s;s of Ri&s;berg, own &s;i&s;ter to the Com|mander, as I think; yes, yes, I am &s;ure &s;he was. To be &s;ure, I was not per&s;onally acquainted with her, but one of your lady aunts was educated in the very convent I was, and &s;he told me of this marriage of her &s;i&s;ter with your father. Aye, with the Baron of Lindorf, I remem|ber it as well as if had only happened ye&s;terday. There was a mutual pa&s;&s;ion, real and true love, and I was ex|ceedingly affected by the &s;tory. Your aunt was in my confidence al&s;o; I told her of my pa&s;&s;ion for the High Chamberlain. Upon my word, all this &s;eems as if it had happened la&s;t week, and here I &s;ee a fine young gentle|man&mdash;the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lde&s;t of the family, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;Were there many children?&mdash;Is your father &s;till alive; and my Lady your mother too?&mdash;Ah! they &s;till adore each other, no doubt. Love, love, only, can give happine&s;s; and my dear friend, your aunt, whom I ju&s;t now men|tioned, is &s;he dead? Is &s;he married? It is &s;o long &s;ince we &s;aw each other, and I have lived retired here &s;o many years, that I have quite lo&s;t &s;ight of former friends."</P>
<P>The&s;e que&s;tions &s;ucceeded each other with &s;uch rapi|dity that Lindorf, &s;urpri&s;ed at the voluble ha&s;te with which they were delivered, &s;carcely could find opportu|nity to come in with a yes; or no; I am an only &s;on; I had the misfortune to lo&s;e my parents: with like an|&s;wers, as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. But his eyes, continually fixed on Caroline, would have &s;aid many things to her if Caroline would have attended to them. She, &s;eemingly ob&s;ervant of nothing but her work, had not ventured a &s;ingle word, when the Canone&s;s de&s;irous of doing ho|nour to her friend&s;hip and affection, a&s;ked her to &s;how the young cavalier her pavilion; and, not fore&s;eeing the lea&s;t ob&s;truction, began, without waiting her reply, to give him its hi&s;tory; why it had been built, by whom the altar, the bu&s;t, the in&s;cription, the painting, the &s;ur|pri&s;e, and every thing; all which he knew as well as her&s;elf; though by his manner, it might well have been &s;uppo&s;ed he had never heard it before.</P>
<P>To a heart undi&s;gui&s;ed and &s;incere by nature, a heart
<PB N="54" REF="034126_0053_0FFA56B808F87A70">
like Caroline's this was too much; &s;he could &s;upport it no longer; and when her friend, &s;urpri&s;ed at her back|wardne&s;s to go to the pavilion, repeated her command, &s;he &s;carcely could articulate that a &s;udden and &s;trange in|di&s;po&s;ition had &s;eized her, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould go. In reality her voice was &s;o affected, her face &s;o pale, and her whole form &s;o altered, that her indi&s;po|&s;ition was &s;ufficiently vi&s;ible, and made the Barone&s;s very unea&s;y, "Dear child, what can be the matter?" &s;aid &s;he, laying her hand on her forehead. "Ye&s;terday even|ing I particularly remarked, when you came in, you &s;eem|ed ab&s;ent, and your mind wholly occupied; and, for &s;e|veral days pa&s;t, you have not only retired &s;ooner than or|dinary, but have been particularly melancholy and agita|ted. My Caroline, Sir, certainly has a fever; 'tis that vile pavilion that kills her. I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, &s;he is quite infatuated with it; and lately, more than ever; for, notwith&s;tanding the humidity of the earth and the air, the moment it had cea&s;ed raining &s;he would be gone, by which means &s;he has caught cold."</P>
<P>Lindorf, without being remarkably vain, had heard &s;ufficient to imagine him&s;elf a party &s;omewhat concern|ed; but, &s;uffering with the &s;uffering Caroline, and mo&s;t de&s;irous of relieving her from pain, he &s;hortened his vi|&s;it, took leave of the ladies, and hoped the indi&s;po&s;ition of Carolin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would have no bad con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Caroline made no other an&s;wer than by courte&s;ying, and the Barone&s;s, repeatedly, entreated Lindorf to take advantage of their near neighbourhood and come fre|quently to the chateau of Rindaw.&mdash;"It is but a &s;tep," &s;aid &s;he. "The poor Commander was gouty, and during three parts of the year, never &s;tirred abroad; but you, Sir, are young and agile, and it will be only a &s;hort walk to our hou&s;e. Mi&s;s Lichtfield will not always be indi&s;|po&s;ed, and &s;ome other day will &s;hew you her pavilion: &s;he tells me it is mo&s;t excellently adapted to mu&s;ic; you, no doubt are a mu&s;ician, and you may play and &s;ing in concert."</P>
<P>It only wanted this la&s;t trait to complete the confu&s;ion of Caroline, and the Barone&s;s &s;eemed not willing any thing &s;hould be wanting. At length the cavalier depart|ed, and the Canone&s;s was &s;ilent. Caroline, however, was not greatly relieve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning on her great chair, her face hid by both her hands, with difficulty &s;he re&s;trained the

tears and &s;obs that ro&s;e thronging for pa&s;&s;age. The Ca|none&s;s attributed all to her indi&s;po&s;ition, and begged her to go and lie down. Caroline was glad to profit by the permi&s;&s;ion. Her chagrin, however, went with her; but, being alone, &s;he could now abandon her&s;elf to grief, and again and again repeated, "Good God! what mu&s;t he think of me!"</P>
<P>The Canone&s;s, alone al&s;o, was occupied by ideas much le&s;s melancholy; the hand&s;ome, the amiable Lindorf had ob&s;olutely gained her heart; he was preci&s;ely the hu&s;|band &s;he wi&s;hed for her dear Caroline. And how happy &s;hould &s;he be to have her near her, at lea&s;t for a part of the year; and to &s;ee her &s;o well, &s;o properly, and &s;o high|ly married! The young officer united in him&s;elf every thing &s;he wi&s;hed; youth, beauty, wit, birth, fortune; for, without mentioning his own wealth, of which he was before in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, being an only &s;on and his pa|rents decea&s;ed, the inheritance of the avaricious Com|mander mu&s;t have been, immen&s;e. Already high in rank in the army, every thing that ambition could hope he &s;eemed formed to obtain.</P>
<P>The advantages of Lindorf were great, yet her dear Caroline was in no re&s;pect inferior: fir&s;t, Caroline was an angel, and as to fortune, that of the High Chamberlain was not to be di&s;dained; to which &s;he &s;hould add all her own; and, together, they would be va&s;t. No match, in &s;hort, could be every way more proper; and the pro|te&s;ted Caroline &s;hould be Barone&s;s of Lindorf, or her en|deavours &s;hould be &s;trangely fru&s;trated. She even fixed on the epocha for celebrating the wedding; the autumn following &s;he determined on, when the High Chamber|lain was to pay his promi&s;ed vi&s;it.</P>
<P>In thinking all this &s;he re&s;olved carefully to conceal her projects and ideas even from Caroline. It would, cer|tainly, be very difficult to be &s;ilent, but her pa&s;&s;ion for every thing romantic was &s;till &s;tronger than her inclination to talk. She imagined what a plea&s;ure it would be to ob|&s;erve the effects of &s;ympathy; to follow it through the progre&s;&s;ions of two young hearts; day after day to &s;ee p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on augmented by hope and fear; and, at la&s;t, to make them happy at the very moment when they expected to be eternally mi&s;erable. Oh! what delicious plea&s;ure, this for the Barone&s;s! But this &s;he could not obtain ex|cept by keeping her &s;ecret.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="034126_0055_0FFA56CDE828AB90">As to the projected union with the Count of Wal&s;tein&punc; &s;he troubled her&s;elf little concerning it; &s;he thought it impo&s;&s;ible not to make the High Chamberlain under&s;tand rea&s;on; for he, mo&s;t certainly, knew, by his own heart, the influence of mutual pa&s;&s;ion. "I need only&mdash;(the Barone&s;s was almo&s;t as &s;imple and innocent as Caroline) I need only to recall to memory how much we &s;uffered for each other, and he will yield, with melting tears, to the happine&s;s of a pair of true lovers. On this condition, too, I will leave Caroline all I po&s;&s;e&s;s. Be&s;ide, when the High Chamberlain &s;hall &s;ee the youthful Lindorf, all per|fect as he is, can he, for a moment, make compari&s;on between him and a mon&s;ter? No, no; leave we &s;ympathy, love, and paternal tenderne&s;s to their natural effects, and the happine&s;s of my dear Caroline is for ever fixed."</P>
<P>While the good Canone&s;s was compo&s;ing her little ro|mance, and enjoying, by anticipation, the tender &s;cenes at which &s;he &s;hould be pre&s;ent, and the &s;weet delight of making two beings happy, Caroline was abandoning her|&s;elf to grief and &s;elf-reproach, for having acted &s;o impru|dently, and given Lindorf an idea &s;o much the rever&s;e of her real character. Every word the Barone&s;s had &s;aid, though unintentionally, had made a wound; every word a thou&s;and times recalled the blu&s;hes and confu&s;ion of Ca|roline. "I will leave Rindaw," &s;aid &s;he, "never more to return. Yet to fly-would be to confe&s;s my guilt; and to confirm the idea, the cruel, di&s;tracting idea, that I am di&s;&s;embling, fal&s;e, and artful. Oh! impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>Then did &s;he &s;earch for and imagine all imaginary means of &s;elf-ju&s;tification; but found not one which did not increa&s;e, in&s;tead of eradicate &s;u&s;picion. So troubled were her thoughts that all night long &s;he lay, re&s;tle&s;s, and di&s;|turbed by ten thou&s;and fears and &s;u&s;picions; and, for the fir&s;t time in her whole life, &s;leep fled from the eyelids of Caroline. How long, how painful was this night, and yet how much was her agitation increa&s;ed, the next morn|ing, when a letter, addre&s;&s;ed to her, was brought by a &s;ervant of Lindorf's, who was waiting for an an&s;wer! The offended Caroline had almo&s;t in&s;tantly returned it uno|pened.&mdash;"What," &s;ays &s;he, "does he write to me pur|po&s;ely to demon&s;trate how much he de&s;pi&s;es me? Nothing but the idea he mu&s;t have entertained of me, for my re|prehen&s;ible conduct, could have emboldened him to take &s;uch a liberty. Yet is not this his excu&s;e? And am not
<PB N="57" REF="034126_0056_0FFA57B54D1722A0">
I alone guilty? How polite, how re&s;pectful was he before the unfortunate vi&s;it of ye&s;terday! Yes, I my&s;elf, alone, am to blame."</P>
<P>But what was to be done with the packet? To open it was impo&s;&s;ible; to return it unopened was very &s;evere. Be&s;ide, who could tell what his thoughts, or what his &s;tyle might be? The letter was held and turned in the hand, and looked at again and again, in every po&s;&s;ible form, as if the eye wi&s;hed to penetrate the paper and pur|loin the contents. At la&s;t, a ray of light broke in upon the mind of Caroline; &s;he determined to run to the cham|ber of her dear Mamma, open her curtains, fall on her knees, and there, with tears and penitence, make a full confe&s;&s;ion of all that had pa&s;&s;ed between her and Lindorf.</P>
<P>The execution was as prompt as the re&s;olve; the &s;e|cond, the run-a-way hor&s;e, the handkerchief, the walk in the garden, every circum&s;tance was related, even to the avowal of the &s;ecret rea&s;ons of her &s;ilence, for which &s;he had been &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>"Judge, Mamma," &s;aid Caroline, "what I &s;uffered during his vi&s;it! I really thought I &s;hould have died! And he to be totally &s;ilent, as if it had been a plot agreed on between both; while you, Mamma, every moment, uncon&s;ciou&s;ly, was piercing my very heart! Can you, can you forgive me for having acted thus? No, load me with your reproaches; I well de&s;erve them all, and they will be le&s;s cutting, le&s;s painful, than tho&s;e with which I load my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Alas! the good Canone&s;s, all emotion, all tenderne&s;s, and tears at her recital, thought of nothing le&s;s than re|proach. She had been dreaming all night on her pro|jected marriage, on which the more &s;he thought, the more &s;he was enchanted; her &s;ole fear had been that Lindorf, &s;o long an officer, &s;o long in commerce with the gay world, might have formed other engagements; but the hi&s;tory of Caroline, and the manner in which &s;he had related it, had quieted all her fears; the Barone&s;s &s;aw, or imagined &s;he &s;aw, that &s;weet &s;ympathy of &s;ouls which re-e&s;tabli&s;hed all her hopes, and gave certainty to all her &s;chemes; &s;he rai&s;ed Caroline, tenderly ki&s;&s;ed her, and declared &s;he never, in her life, had heard any thing &s;o intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>"Ah! if I had but known it!&mdash;To be &s;ure, I &s;hould not have &s;aid many things I did &s;ay; for the&s;e men are
<PB N="58" REF="034126_0057_0FFA56DAB32E8230">
&s;o &s;elf-&s;ufficient, &s;o ready to believe well of them&s;elves, and that we women are enamoured of them!&mdash;However, I mu&s;t do Lindorf the ju&s;tice to &s;ay he is very different from men in general; his mode&s;ty, his politene&s;s"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ah! Mamma," &s;aid Caroline, &s;haking her head, and interrupting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Barone&s;s, "I have but too much cau&s;e to fear he is like the re&s;t. Has he not had the audacity to write to me this morning?"</P>
<P>"Write to thee child! Quick, quick, quick! Show me the letter, read it, let me hear his &s;tyle, his &s;entiments; I can imagine all his ardour."</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid Caroline, taking the packet from her pocket, "here it is; it would not have been proper, Mamma, for me to have opened it. You will do with it what you plea&s;e." And the plea&s;ure of the Barone&s;s was, in&s;tantly, to break the &s;eal; for her curio&s;ity was &s;tronger even than that of Caroline, which was much di|mini&s;hed by fears of what might be the contents of the letter. The fir&s;t thing they came to was a polite card, in the u&s;ual &s;tyle, in which the Baron of Lindorf "pre&s;ent|ed re&s;pectful compliments to the ladies, inquired after their health, and, in particular, concerning the indi&s;po|&s;ition of Mi&s;s Lichtfield."</P>
<P>But all this was a mere pretext; and, certainly, needed not to have been &s;o clo&s;ely &s;ealed up; wherefore, this laid by, a paper, folded up and placed under the card, was eagerly &s;eized and opened. Caroline, trembling as &s;he unfolded it, after &s;lightly running it over to her&s;elf, read aloud as follows:</P>
<P>"I am about, Madam, to commit a new impropriety, to aggravate former errors, and, perhaps, increa&s;e anger which I had but too ju&s;tly rai&s;ed, by a new offence. Now, while I write, I imagine your indignation, feel the effects of your re&s;entment, behold my&s;elf puni&s;hed for my te|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erity, yet have not the power to forbear. If, Madam, you will but deign to read this letter, and &s;urmount that fir&s;t emotion which &s;hould bid you tear or &s;end it back unopened, you then, at lea&s;t, will under&s;tand my motives, and confe&s;s that to you, alone, could I, with propriety, addre&s;s my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"You know not all my offences. No, Madam, you know them not; and yet you treat me with as much &s;e|verity as if you were acquainted with my whole guilt. Since, then, I am not benefited by your ignorance of it,
<PB N="59" REF="034126_0058_0FFA57BE9DC060F8">
I will make a free confe&s;&s;ion; hoping that my &s;incerity may obtain a generous pardon.</P>
<P>"Four times did I, ye&s;terday, pa&s;s your pavilion, each at a different hour, hoping to find you there and a&s;k per|mi&s;&s;ion to pay my re&s;pects to you and the Barone&s;s: but continually were my hopes deceived; you appeared no more in that pavilion &s;o dear to you, and in which you had before that time uncea&s;ingly dwelt; while I, far from &s;u&s;pecting the truth, far from accu&s;ing you as the cau&s;e of this ab&s;ence, ca&s;t the whole blame on Madam the Ba|rone&s;s; &s;he, thought I, informed of my temerity, not knowing who the per&s;on was who had dared to obtrude into your a&s;ylum, had forbidden you to go there any more. Vain and weak as I was, I even imagined you might obey with regret; I thought my&s;elf certain that, when I was known to Madam the Barone&s;s, &s;he would no longer lay you under the like re&s;traint, and, therefore, did not he&s;itate to com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and pay her my re&s;pects in the afternoon. Alas! Madam, how &s;everely, and how ju&s;tly have you puni&s;hed my pre&s;umption! Your reception of me, &s;o very different from hers, in&s;tantly informed me how much I had been deceived; and that it was you, alone, who thus had renounced the unfortunate &s;tranger. You did not permit me to entertain the lea&s;t doubt, the lea&s;t hope; the illu&s;ion was wholly de&s;troyed; I in&s;tantly &s;aw that Madam the Barone&s;s, whom I had imagined &s;o &s;evere, was ignorant even of my exi&s;tence, and that the youthful, the ocauteous Caroline, whom I had &s;uppo&s;ed obedient to her commands, to the coun&s;els of, perhaps, a too rigid friend, had been &s;ubject only to her own pru|dence, uncommon and unexpected as it was in a lady &s;o young. I had been happy had this prudence only been extended to a &s;tranger who might him&s;elf have been an improper per&s;on, or have had improper de&s;igns; but, though this doubt was removed, though I was named and known, I could not obtain &s;o much as a look of pardon. Your determined &s;ilence, Madam, your refu&s;al to &s;hew me the pavilion, your apparent anger at the invitation of the Barone&s;s, all informed me that I, per&s;onally, had gi|ven irreparable offence. However, Madam, whatever my errors may have been, whatever I may endure, I will not again offend by vi&s;iting at Rindaw without your per|mi&s;&s;ion; yet &s;uffer me to &s;upplicate this permi&s;&s;ion, and be a&s;&s;ured, Madam, I will endeavour hereafter to de&s;erve
<PB N="60" REF="034126_0059_0FFA56E88B2122E8">
it. You were a witne&s;s to the obliging manner in which Madam the Barone&s;s was plea&s;ed to de&s;ire I would fre|quently vi&s;it at Rindaw. What an&s;wer am I to make to a reque&s;t &s;o kind, and which I &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;h to profit by? You, Madam, mu&s;t decide. On you my conduct mu&s;t depend. Mu&s;t I neglect the civilities of Madam the Barone&s;s, and &s;ubmit to that &s;entence of condemna|tion which you have &s;ilently pronounced; or may I dare entreat you to revoke it? I wait your commands, and &s;o|lemnly vow, whatever they be, to me they &s;hall be &s;acred. Yet permit me, for a moment, to hope you will not be inexorable; and that he, whom your re&s;pectable friend has deigned to honour with her protection, may, being thus protected, obtain a pardon which is become ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary to the future happine&s;s of his life."</P>
<P>While Caroline was reading this letter, which was da|ted from the chateau of Ri&s;berg, &s;he felt a confu&s;ed mix|ture of &s;en&s;ations &s;o oppo&s;ite to each other as to be almo&s;t inde&s;inable. At fir&s;t, utter a&s;toni&s;hment at perceiving, without ever &s;u&s;pecting her&s;elf to be thus con&s;ummately prudent; afterwards, that kind of &s;hame which a &s;incere mind feels at receiving prai&s;e it does not merit; and, next joy of the mo&s;t pure and perfect kind to learn that &s;he was &s;till e&s;teemed and &s;till re&s;pected. Yet, on re|flection, &s;he was &s;omewhat unea&s;y concerning the poor young gentleman, the embarra&s;&s;ment he was under, and the means of removing it, without de&s;troying the high opinion he entertained of her.</P>
<P>The&s;e different affections were alternately vi&s;ible in her countenance; plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, however were predo|minant, and her heart felt ea&s;ed of a mo&s;t in&s;upportable burthen. When &s;he had fini&s;hed the letter, &s;he could have pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips; but &s;he forbore, laid it on the pillow of the Canone&s;s, &s;eized one of her hands, and on that be&s;towed her ki&s;&s;es and her tears. Again the Baro|ne&s;s took the letter, again de&s;ired Caroline to read it, and again was in raptures.</P>
<P>"Did not I tell you this young gentleman did not re|&s;emble other men? I &s;aw it in&s;tantly. What a delicate turn has he given to your &s;ilence and embarra&s;&s;ment, which he had under&s;tood to proceed from anger! Is it po&s;&s;ible to be more mode&s;t, or more re&s;pectful? One of your court fops would have interpreted the whole of

Well, really he is a mo&s;t charming youth, and we mu&s;t in&s;tantly put him out of pain. Get the pen and ink, my dear, &s;it down and write; come, come, make ha&s;te."</P>
<P>"I! Mamma," &s;aid Caroline, blu&s;hing. "I thought you would have been kind enough to an&s;wer his letter."</P>
<P>"You know my dear girl, it is with difficulty I can write, at pre&s;ent. (The Barone&s;s had a di&s;order in her eyes, the con&s;equence of her illne&s;s, and her &s;ight daily became wor&s;e.) But no matter; you &s;hall write in my name, and I will dictate." Caroline obeyed, and, hav|ing taken pen, ink, and paper, the Canone&s;s, after con&s;i|dering a moment, thus began:</P>
<P>"Sir.</P>
<P>"Your letter came mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onably to the relief and con&s;olation of Caroline; &s;he had all night lain in the mo&s;t de&s;perate affliction&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Really, Mamma," &s;aid Caroline, &s;topping her, "I cannot write what you bid me; for, though I own it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> partly true, it would ab&s;olutely contradict all his pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> favourable thoughts concerning me."</P>
<P>After a &s;hort conte&s;t, the Barone&s;s owned Carolin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> right; the paper was torn, another &s;heet taken, the Ba|rone&s;s again began to think and to dictate.</P>
<P>"Sir,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Lichtfield is mo&s;t exceedingly glad to find you entertain &s;o high an opinion of her, her joy cannot be expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Upon my word, Mamma," &s;aid Caroline, throwing down the pen, "this is wor&s;e than the other; let me beg you will neither &s;peak of my joys nor griefs."</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s was now ab&s;olutely vexed, and &s;aid &s;he would have nothing at all to do with her an&s;wer; and that &s;he might write it her&s;elf. Caroline began to think this the wi&s;e&s;t way, and after con&s;idering in her turn, and, in her turn, tearing two or three &s;heets of paper, &s;he had the good &s;en&s;e, at la&s;t, to recollect that the &s;im|ple&s;t and mo&s;t unaffected mode is always the be&s;t; &s;he therefore wrote,</P>
<P>"We thank you, Sir, for the concern you are kind enough to take in the health of your neighbours. My indi&s;po&s;ition is gone off. Madam the Barone&s;s is depri|ved, by the di&s;order in her eyes, of the plea&s;ure of an|&s;wering your letter, the contents of which I have ju&s;t
<PB N="62" REF="034126_0061_0FFA56F8C2A2AEC0">
communicated to her; &s;he has therefore de&s;ired me to inform you, Sir, that your vi&s;its will always be well re|ceived at Rindaw; the Baron of Lindorf, when known, never can doubt of a proper reception. "C. L."</P>
<P>The Canone&s;s thought the &s;tyle of this exceedingly common and trivial; there were a thou&s;and things to &s;ay, a thou&s;and &s;en&s;ations to commun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cate, according to her; but Caroline was firm, and would not change a word, and, at la&s;t, by care&s;&s;es and coaxing, prevailed on the Baro|ne&s;s to let the letter be &s;ent.</P>
<P>As to the epi&s;tle of Lindorf, we have been a&s;&s;ured, from the be&s;t authority, that it was read and re-read at lea&s;t a hundred times that day; and that, before the even|ing there was a per&s;on in the world who could have re|peated it by heart. It is likewi&s;e affirmed that the&s;e re|peated readings had di&s;&s;ipated every remaining trace of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> over-night's chagrin. Yes, Caroline, by being thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uently told of her uncommon prudence, at la&s;t belie|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> real; &s;till, however, owning that &s;he never could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">agined her ab&s;ence from the pavilion, and her &s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with her friend, could have been productive of &s;uch excellent effects. It was very certain, neverthele&s;s, that the thought was her own; wherefore, gaining her own &s;elf-e&s;teem by degrees, no longer having any rea&s;on to blu&s;h for her my&s;terious conduct towar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Barone&s;s, and being a&s;&s;ured of the re&s;pect of Lindorf, Caroline lo&s;t both her &s;orrows and her fears.</P>
<P>Nobody will doubt but that Lindorf was very careful to avail him&s;elf of the permi&s;&s;ion granted, and to pay his re&s;pects in the evening. Caroline had fore&s;een this, ex|pected him with &s;omewhat of impatience, &s;aw him arrive with joy, and not without emotion. He him&s;elf was ra|ther di&s;concerted, but a gentle &s;mile from Caroline pre|&s;ently re&s;tored him all his former ea&s;e; they both became perfectly uncon&s;trained, to which the Barone&s;s did not a little contribute; &s;he, with plea&s;antry which &s;he highly enjoyed, ran over every incident of the &s;tranger, the &s;e|cret, and the letter; and thus &s;aved Caroline explana|tions which &s;he was mo&s;t happy to avoid.</P>
<P>Lindorf was cautious and penetrating; he read the feelings of Caroline: they went together to the pavilion, and he &s;aid not a word that had the &s;lighte&s;t reference to what had pa&s;&s;ed, except that he entreated Caroline to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. She c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;eated, and Lin|dorf
<PB N="63" REF="034126_0062_0FFA57D8A6DD3BE8">
accompanied her on the piano forte; but, though he was an excellent mu&s;ician, he was often out of time; and Caroline her&s;elf made &s;everal mi&s;takes. Notwith&s;tanding this, the &s;ong plea&s;ed him &s;o much that he a&s;ked permi&s;|&s;ion to take and copy it; which granted, Lindorf, on re|ceiving it, had the courage to ki&s;s the hand by which it was pre&s;ented, and to pronounce, in a half whi&s;per, "How good, Madam, are you to-day, and how different are my pre&s;ent feelings from tho&s;e of ye&s;terday!" The ingenuous Caroline was on the point of declaring that &s;he her&s;elf was much ea&s;ier and happier, but &s;he ju&s;t had the recollection to refrain. They returned to the Canone&s;s, and Lindorf, &s;hortening his vi&s;it, begged permi&s;&s;ion to repeat it on the morrow.</P>
<P>The morrow and the morrow, and every &s;ucceeding morrow, each re&s;embled the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her; and this was the hi&s;|tory of their lives. Again Caroline inhabited her pavili|on, in the morning; and again Lindorf took his u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ride. The hor&s;e, formerly &s;o unmanageable, was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> quite docile; &s;o that he would &s;ometimes &s;tand qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> half an hour, under the window of Caroline, with w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he began to be acquainted, and which, when he came to, he in&s;tinctively would &s;top at. Every afternoon Lindorf came betimes to Rindaw, where he often remained to &s;up; and every night, after he was gone, the Canone&s;s, more and more tran&s;ported with his conduct, &s;poke of him with enthu&s;ia&s;m. Caroline li&s;tened, and mode&s;tly approved, and each went nightly to bed declaring he was the mo&s;t amiable of men: nay, Caroline it is &s;aid, would &s;ometimes repeat it in her &s;leep; and as for the Barone&s;s, her nocturnal dreams were all concerning the marriage &s;he had imagined, and which &s;he thought nothing could fru&s;trate.</P>
<P>Well, but Lindorf?&mdash;Why Lindorf had his dreams likewi&s;e; for he loved with an ardour which he &s;ought not to oppo&s;e, and with a &s;incerity that gave dignity to affection, which every day grew &s;tronger. Born with great &s;en&s;ibility and &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, he had not lived till five-and-twenty without a knowledge of love, or, at lea&s;t, without a &s;uppo&s;ed knowledge. But how different were his former tumultuous &s;en&s;ations to tho&s;e he at pre&s;ent felt! His thoughts all tender, delicate, and pure, had no other object but Caroline&punc; happy in her &s;ight, happy to hear the &s;weet &s;ound of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, infinitely happy in her pre|&s;ence

and that &s;weet familiarity which country retirement authori&s;es, he could not imagine &s;uperior bli&s;s; and if, when alone, which walking, mu&s;ic, and the infirmities of the Barone&s;s occa&s;ioned them often to be, he &s;ometimes were like to betray him&s;elf, and ri&s;k an avowal of his &s;entiments: timidity, re&s;pect, and dread of de&s;troying that &s;hare of felicity of which he was in pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, always made him &s;ilent. Such ever are the effects of true and &s;incere love. Caroline too confided all her thoughts to him with &s;uch innocence, &s;uch &s;ecurity, he was &s;o perfectly convinced that &s;he no way &s;u&s;pected either what pa&s;&s;ed in his heart or her own, that Lindorf, who&s;e deli|cacy equalled his affection, would likewi&s;e have thought it a crime to di&s;turb that happy ignorance before the mo|ment in which he him&s;elf &s;hould be at his own di&s;po&s;al, which he could not then be perfectly &s;aid to be.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, what could he gain by the confe&s;&s;ion? A know|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that his love was returned. And could he doubt of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Certainly not; for, though the penetration of man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not that of women in this re&s;pect, Caroline was &s;o frank, and &s;o little under&s;tood the art of di&s;&s;embling, of concealing her feelings, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to doubt. She alone was ignorant of them. She &s;uppo&s;ed her love for Lindorf was the love of a &s;i&s;ter, and her af|fection the affection of friend&s;hip; &s;he even applauded her&s;elf for daily finding fre&s;h occa&s;ion to love him more, nor had the &s;lighte&s;t idea that an attachment &s;o pure, as &s;he felt hers to be, could, in the lea&s;t, become injurious to engagements which &s;he held &s;acred, but of which &s;he &s;eldom thought. How, indeed, could &s;he? Was there time to think on any thing but Lindorf, when Lindorf was pre&s;ent? And he was ever pre&s;ent, either ideally or really; for, the moment he was gone, either the plea&s;ure of having &s;een him, impatience to &s;ee him again, or his image in every attitude, under every a&s;pect in which it had &s;o lately been beheld, occupied her whole thoughts. Lindorf to Caroline was every thing, and, the Barone&s;s excepted, &s;he knew not of, thought not of, any other being in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>This imprudent Barone&s;s &s;till added, by her enthu&s;ia&s;m, to the fa&s;cination of Caroline. From infancy accu&s;tomed to think as &s;he thought, and to &s;ee as &s;he &s;aw, her autho|rity would have been fully &s;ufficient to fix the attachment of Caroline on a per&s;on for whom the Canone&s;s had a pre|dilection
<PB N="65" REF="034126_0064_0FFA1B761467D8B0">
&s;o ab&s;olute, and &s;o continually augmenting. Of|ten did the Barone&s;s, when &s;he could find opportunity by being left for a moment with Lindorf, &s;uffer her &s;e|cret half to e&s;cape; clearly enough did &s;he give him to under&s;tand that it depended on him, only, to obtain the hand of Caroline; and that &s;he already looked upon him as her &s;on.</P>
<P>Thus the happy Lindorf, encouraged by one, adored by the other, and, perhaps, in more full and delicious enjoy|ment of happine&s;s than if he had been a declared lover, thought him&s;elf certain of prevailing the moment he &s;hould &s;peak; and for which moment he waited a little impatiently. Engagements he had, by which he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n re&s;trained; and from the&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to be free before he could hone&s;tly avow his pa&s;&s;ion for Caro|line, and make an offer of his hand and heart. He had been very bu&s;ily employed in removing the&s;e ob&s;tacles; and for &s;ome time pa&s;t, his agitation and &s;hort &s;ymptoms of melancholy betrayed &s;omething of his inquietude and fears.</P>
<P>One evening, as he left Rindaw, he informed the la|dies he was fearful le&s;t he could not have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them on the morrow; he was obliged to go, him|&s;elf, immediately to Berlin, where he expected to find letters that were to him of the utmo&s;t importance. "But," added he, with a tone of voice more than u&s;ually animated, "I hope, in compen&s;ation for a day thus lo&s;t to life, I &s;hall be permitted to return early the morning after."</P>
<P>The Canone&s;s immediately invited him to breakfa&s;t, and Caroline accompanied him to the garden, where they took leave of each other as if it were for a long farewell, and &s;eparated, impatiently wi&s;hing the morrow over. The next day, which for two months had been the only one pa&s;&s;ed without Lindorf, appeared exceedingly tedious to both the ladies, The good Barone&s;s loved Lindorf &s;o entirely, that, had not her friend&s;hip for Caroline inter|vened, which we mu&s;t do her the ju&s;tice to acknowledge was always predominant, he might, in all probability, if &s;o he had plea&s;ed, have even bani&s;hed the High Chamber|lain from her bo&s;om. She acknowledged that Lindorf continually brought him to her recollection, and made her remember the happy days of their former loves. "Yes," &s;aid the Barone&s;s, "the High Chamberlain was ju&s;t &s;o fine, &s;o &s;weet a youth."</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="034126_0065_0FFA57195143D0A8">"My father, then, is &s;urpri&s;ingly altered," &s;aid Ca|roline.</P>
<P>"Ah! yes, my dear," replied the Barone&s;s, "what|ever he may be at pre&s;ent, he was then a mo&s;t charming man&mdash;If thy mother had not been &s;o rich&mdash;But, alas! my dear High Chamberlain was ever ambitious."</P>
<P>"And is &s;till," mournfully thought Caroline; "he is not altered in that re&s;pect; his poor child is the victim of that unrelenting ambition, to which every other feeling has been &s;acrificed."</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation, this gloomy retro&s;pect, naturally led her to think of the Count, and of her union with him. The ab&s;ence of Lindorf, and the certainty of not &s;eeing him all the long long day, had di&s;po&s;ed her mind to languor and melancholy: in the evening &s;he walked in the garden, when the&s;e &s;en&s;ations and gloomy ideas accompanied her: the image of the Count, particularly, tormented her; in &s;pite of every effort to remove it from her imagination, and to think on &s;omething el&s;e, it con|tinually recurred, and with encrea&s;ing pain and di&s;gu&s;t. A dry and yellow leaf fell from one of the trees at her feet, and approaching autumn immediately ro&s;e to me|mory; her heart &s;hrunk at the thought, and an oppre&s;|&s;ive weight, almo&s;t to &s;uffocation, came over her; tears at length began to flow.</P>
<P>"And is the &s;ummer, this happy &s;ummer, already pa&s;&s;ed? It has endured but a moment, and it will return no more: with it ea&s;e and content are fled from Caroline. Autumn approaches, it is here, and my father is coming to tear me from the&s;e beloved haunts, to &s;eparate me from my good Mamma; and, if the Count my hu&s;band plea&s;es &mdash;My hu&s;band!&mdash;My hu&s;band!&mdash;O Lindorf! friend, brother, every thing that e&s;teem holds mo&s;t dear, mu&s;t I never &s;ee thee more!&mdash;Alas! poor Caroline, wherefore ha&s;t thou known him if thou mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon be &s;eparate from him!"</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t time &s;he had ever made the reflection, and it was &s;o cutting, &s;o dreadful, and affected her &s;o much, that it ab&s;orbed every other afflicting thought.</P>
<P>Intent on this idea, and ab&s;ent to every other, &s;he walk|ed till &s;he came to the door of the pavilion that led to the road. It was open: oppo&s;ite it was a wood. Caro|line was alone: the thick foliage was adapted to the pre|&s;ent temper of her mind; it was dark and gloomy, and
<PB N="67" REF="034126_0066_0FFA57E202B3D560">
almo&s;t &s;hut out day. During the &s;ummer &s;he had often wi&s;hed to walk in this wood, but with Lindorf it would have been improper; the recollection of this wi&s;h &s;lightly returned; there was no pre&s;ent re&s;traint, and &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the road. As &s;he entered the wood, &s;he felt her&s;elf highly affected by objects which were new to Caroline. It was a glorious evening; the rays of the &s;etting &s;un with gold and purple beamed over the horizon through an immen&s;e &s;pace of clouds, which &s;eemed almo&s;t on fire, and the red &amp; ardent colours of which were &s;een through the branches of oaks who&s;e antiquity appeared almo&s;t coeval with Na|ture. The evening &s;ong of the birds was loud, melodi|ous, and univer&s;al; to which the monotonous chirping, of the &s;warming gra&s;s-hopper gave variety.</P>
<P>If it be imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le for a feeling mind ever to enter a fore&s;t with indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, what emotion mu&s;t the young heart of Caroline, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in its pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, receive from objects &s;o va&s;t and &s;o magnificent! She took the fir&s;t path &s;he &s;aw, and which apparently led through the wood; &s;he followed it, for a con&s;iderable time, without thinking or perceiving how far &s;he had &s;trayed; at length, &s;ome noi&s;e &s;uddenly drew her from the profound reverie in which &s;he was plunged; &s;he looked up and &s;aw before her, at no great di&s;tance, a grand and elegant chateau; &s;he had not much time for reflection; there was an avenue that led to that chateau, and in that avenue was&mdash;Lindorf.</P>
<P>The lover in&s;tantly leaped the wall that &s;eparated them, for he had &s;een Caroline; and already he is by her &s;ide, already te&s;tifying, more by looks than words, his a&s;ton|i&s;hment and joy at finding her almo&s;t at his own habita|tion. Caroline, confu&s;ed, amazed, blu&s;hed even to the finger ends, and dur&s;t not look on Lindorf, but, &s;tam|mering, &s;aid &s;he had lo&s;t her&s;elf!&mdash;She was ab&s;olutely ig|norant of&mdash;She had &s;uppo&s;ed Ri&s;berg lay another way!</P>
<P>Lindorf &s;aw, by her manner, &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o, and, far from pre&s;&s;ing her to &s;tay, far from de&s;iring her to walk into his gardens and repo&s;e her&s;elf, he had the delicacy to offer to re-conduct her to Rindaw immediately. The offer was in&s;tantly accepted, and Lindorf, to vary the walk of Caroline, took another path, &s;till, as he &s;aid, more agreeable, &s;till more plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Lindorf, undoubtedly, by the plea&s;ante&s;t under&s;tood the longe&s;t, and the di&s;tance was doubled. Caroline
<PB N="68" REF="034126_0067_0FFA5721A68E6068">
could not but remark it, and was &s;o fatigued at la&s;t as to be obliged to accept an arm &s;he had at fir&s;t refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"This way mu&s;t be greatly round about, Sir?"</P>
<P>"It is; I a&s;k pardon, but I was willing you &s;hould know what I do every day."</P>
<P>"How do you mean, Sir?"</P>
<P>"When I go to Rindaw, I take the &s;horte&s;t way, through the wood; but when I return home I go this, which is the mo&s;t round about."</P>
<P>Caroline blu&s;hed, and made no reply.</P>
<P>Whether it was a continuation of the reflections of the day, or whether it was her e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rra&s;&s;ment at finding her|&s;elf at Ri&s;berg, the pre&s;ence of Lindorf had failed of its u&s;ual effect; far from di&s;&s;ipating, it but increa&s;ed her pre|&s;ent dejection of &s;pirits; tears &s;tood brim full in her eyes, and &s;he felt that if &s;he had but &s;pok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingle word they mu&s;t have overflowed.</P>
<P>Lindorf, on the contrary, had, when they fir&s;t met, &s;eemed more than u&s;ually plea&s;ed and contented; joy un|mixed enlivened his countenance, and gave animation to every feature and every expre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on. He had &s;poken with rapture of the beauties of the country, and the delight of living there with the per&s;on on earth the mo&s;t beloved. Caroline &s;carcely could give the &s;horte&s;t an&s;wers, &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion was there at her heart; Lindorf could not help remarking the change; he was &s;ilent, and ob&s;erved her with eyes alternately expre&s;&s;ive of tenderne&s;s, hope, and fear. He appeared as if he had &s;omething to &s;ay which he dur&s;t not utter. The moon ro&s;e, and her &s;oft clear beams, glimmering on their &s;ilent path, &s;till increa&s;ed their mutual emotion.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Caroline, having recovered her&s;elf &s;ufficiently to pronounce a few words, a&s;ked Lindorf if he had recei|ved the letters he had &s;o impatiently expected.</P>
<P>"The letters! The letters!" repeated Lindorf, with pa&s;&s;ion in his words and looks, "O, yes! I have recei|ved them!&mdash;You know not, dear Caroline, cannot ima|gine, how e&s;&s;entially the&s;e letters may influence my fu|ture happine&s;s!&mdash;To morrow morning I will come, will communicate their contents.&mdash;Yes, charming Caroline, gentle&s;t and deare&s;t friend of my heart," to morrow you &s;hall read that heart which burns with impatience to ex|pand, to unburthen it&s;elf, and pour its mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts into your bo&s;om&mdash;Every thing I think, every thing I feel,
<PB N="69" REF="034126_0068_0FFA57F1FB7705C0">
all I have thought, and all I have felt, to morrow you &s;hall know; and my de&s;tiny &s;hall be eternally decided!"</P>
<P>The&s;e words, and particularly the tone and manner in which they were uttered, rou&s;ed and terrified Caroline: they tore off the veil which had already been half rai&s;ed. Without the power of replying a &s;ingle word, &s;he &s;till had the force to di&s;engage her arm, which Lindorf pre&s;|&s;ed with ardour, and, looking up, found her&s;elf preci&s;ely oppo&s;ite the garden door, which &s;he precipitately enter|ed; &s;aying, with words that almo&s;t choaked her as they obtained pa&s;&s;age, "Farewell, Lindorf!&mdash;To morrow&mdash; I will, al&s;o&mdash;tell you &s;omething&mdash;You &s;hall hear"&mdash;</P>
<P>She could contain no longer; her head fell on her bo|&s;om; her tears, too long withheld, &s;treamed down her cheeks; a univer&s;al tremor &s;eized her, and &s;he was obli|ged to &s;it down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> gra&s;s bank.</P>
<P>And Lindorf?&mdash;Why Lindorf follows. Lindorf is at her feet. Lindorf is pre&s;&s;ing with tran&s;port her lily hands, and &s;tooping to ki&s;s them, while Caroline is unable to re|&s;i&s;t; he dares even cla&s;p her in his arms; and the languid head of Caroline, reclining, droops upon his &s;houlder.</P>
<P>"My deare&s;t, my be&s;t beloved," &s;aid Lindorf; "Oh! &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;uage, to dry tho&s;e precious tears, pledges of my approaching happine&s;s.&mdash;Adored lady! Oh calm thy&s;elf, fear not; 'tis thy friend, thy lover, thy future hu&s;band, who thus conjures thee."</P>
<P>This word, this dreadful word, recalled Caroline to animation and her&s;elf. She ro&s;e, terrified, broke from Lindorf, would have &s;poke, but could not articulate a word, and, &s;huddering at her pre&s;ent danger, felt that flight alone could retrieve, could &s;ave her. Lindorf re|mained, for a moment, half amazed at the terror of Ca|roline, and doubting to what motives it ought to be attri|buted; while &s;he e&s;caped, ran to her chamber, threw her&s;elf into the fir&s;t chair &s;he found, and was &s;o affected, for &s;ome time, that &s;he lo&s;t all coherency of thought.</P>
<P>She remained not long in this &s;tate; and that which &s;ucceeded was much more dreadful. Happily for her, the Barone&s;s had gone to bed before &s;upper, as &s;he &s;ome|times did, and was in a &s;ound &s;leep: her appearance, therefore, was di&s;pen&s;ed with; and, that &s;he might with freedom yield to her pre&s;ent feelings without a witne&s;s, &s;he likewi&s;e determined to go to bed and di&s;mi&s;s her maid.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was &s;ufficiently collected to reflect, not
<PB N="70" REF="034126_0069_0FFA572B8328E620">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">apathy, but &s;omething more calmly, on her pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, &s;he felt the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of informing Lin|dorf &s;he was no longer free, and of determining never to &s;ee him more. The &s;entence was indeed mo&s;t &s;evere. Virtue pronounced it; but the heart of Virtue her&s;elf mu&s;t bleed while it was pronounced. Caroline no longer could, in the lea&s;t, deceive her&s;elf re&s;pecting the nature of her feelings. Love &s;tood confe&s;&s;ed, arrayed in all his tyranny; his arm was pitile&s;s, and his power unbounded. Sorrow &s;harpened his arrows, and De&s;pair &s;hot them; yet De&s;pair it&s;elf only confirmed Caroline in her re&s;olution; Di&s;honour threatened her, and &s;he did not he&s;itate a moment.</P>
<P>But how was &s;he to inform him?&mdash;How &s;peak the dreadful tidings?&mdash;The &s;cene of the evening was too re|cent and too painful to ri&s;k renewin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd &s;he felt it im|po&s;&s;ible to be her&s;elf the narrator. A letter was the only means, and &s;he was all night mentally occupied in wri|ting it; but a letter, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and with &s;en|&s;ations like hers, was not ea&s;ily written; each word, each phra&s;e, appeared either too cold or too pa&s;&s;ionate. At length, when &s;he had imagined nearly the manner and the turn &s;he &s;hould give it, &s;he was impatient for day-break, that &s;he might ri&s;e and write. Every minute did &s;he open her curtains, hoping to di&s;cover the fir&s;t rays of morning; and no &s;ooner had &s;he di&s;covered them than &s;he left her bed, put on a morning gown, and prepared to begin this mo&s;t painful ta&s;k.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een that every thing Caroline mo&s;t delighted in had found the way to the pavilion; and &s;o had her ink-&s;tand, and writing-de&s;k, along with the re&s;t. There was nothing in her chamber wherewith &s;he might trace a &s;ingle line; patience, therefore, was her la&s;t re|&s;ource, and waiting till the &s;ervants were up and &s;hould open the doors. But, as none of the&s;e had a lover to di&s;mi&s;s, they &s;lept a full hour longer. This hour Caroline pa&s;&s;ed at her window, and it depended wholly on her to have enjoyed the mo&s;t &s;ublime of &s;ights, and no doubt, for the fir&s;t time in her life. The retiring of darkne&s;s, the gradual increa&s;e of light, and the &s;un ri&s;ing in all its &s;plendour and animating great Nature, made no impre&s;|&s;ion on the wretched heart of Caroline. Lindorf, whom &s;he was forever to forbid her pre&s;ence, whom &s;he was to render mi&s;erable; Lindorf, who&s;e love &s;he had been ig|norant
<PB N="71" REF="034126_0070_0FFA57FB0789FE20">
of, and ignorant al&s;o how dear he was to her till the very moment when they mu&s;t &s;eparate forever; Lin|dorf ob&s;cured every object, &s;he thought of him only, him only &s;he &s;aw. The bright colours of the morning, the &s;un's rays, and the revival of Nature, were to her, all dark and inanimate.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner could &s;he go out but &s;he ran to the pavilion. It was nece&s;&s;ary that Lindorf &s;hould receive her letter before his arrival at Rindaw; and Caroline had no doubt but he would be there as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;Mournfully, then, &s;he took her way towards the pavilion; but what were her thoughts, what her emotion, when, as &s;he en|tered, &s;he &s;aw, or thought &s;he &s;aw, Lindorf him&s;elf, &s;eat|ed at the far end, pale, dejected, his hair all in di&s;order, leaning on his elbow, and apparently plunged in the mo&s;t profound reverie!</P>
<P>We &s;ay thought &s;he &s;aw, becau&s;e, for the moment, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be an illu&s;ion of a mind that had lately been mo&s;t liable to illu&s;ion, and of an imagination that beheld no other object. She looked and &s;hrieked, but &s;he could not any longer doubt it was Lindorf him&s;elf, when, as &s;he &s;hrieked, he ro&s;e, flew to catch her, fell at her feet, and uttered with an impetuo&s;ity it was not in her pow|er to &s;top, "Oh! pardon, pardon, Caroline, pardon one who adores you! Think not I have forfeited my word. Ye&s;terday, when I left you, I went home, but, think not I pa&s;&s;ed the night in &s;leep; no, at day-break I ro&s;e; hither my wi&s;hes bore me; the door was open; in &s;hort I &s;carcely know how I came in this place, but this place never will I leave, Caroline, no never, by every &s;acred power I &s;wear, never, till thou ha&s;t told me what my de&s;|tiny is to be; or, at lea&s;t, Caroline, till thou ha&s;t &s;uffered thy happy lover to interpret thy &s;ilence and emotion in his own favour. A &s;mile will &s;uffice. Certain of thy con&s;ent and the con&s;ent of our dear friend the Barone&s;s, I will fly to obtain that of thy father.&mdash;To-morrow, yes, perhaps, to-morrow, thou maye&s;t confe&s;s, without blu&s;hing, thou love&s;t!"</P>
<P>This, no doubt, was the moment to have &s;poken. A word would have been enough, would have in&s;tantly de|&s;troyed the lovers deare&s;t, &s;weete&s;t hopes, but, oh! how painful was it to pronounce a word like this! It &s;topped &s;hort as it ro&s;e to the lips; Caroline wi&s;hed but could not utter it. Lindorf, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by former appear|ances,
<PB N="72" REF="034126_0071_0FFA57374F287E40">
interpreted this &s;ilence in his own favour; it was attributed to mode&s;ty, embarra&s;&s;ment, timidity; and, wi&s;hing to oblige her to &s;peak, he precipitately ro&s;e, ran, and &s;natched his hat as it lay on the piano forte.</P>
<P>"Dear Caroline," &s;aid he, as he &s;eized it, "I would not lo&s;e a moment when happine&s;s &s;o &s;upreme is in que&s;|tion! I will no longer demand a confe&s;&s;ion which I &s;ee di&s;tre&s;&s;es you &s;o much to make; I will fly in&s;tantly to Berlin, and as in&s;tantly return; I hope, with a better claim to reque&s;t this confe&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Longer delay was now impo&s;&s;ible. Caroline, terrified, collecting all her force, &s;topped and held Lindorf.&mdash; "What are you going to do?" &s;aid &s;he. "Alas! you know not&mdash;But learn"&mdash;</P>
<P>Lindorf him&s;elf no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> partook of the terror of Caroline. "Learn what?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"A &s;ecret."</P>
<P>"What &s;ecret! Speak&punc; Caroline, relea&s;e me from this dread."</P>
<P>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I am"&mdash;</P>
<P>"You are"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Married."</P>
<P>The bolt of thunder could not have &s;truck more effec|tually&mdash;"Married!" repeated he, with the accent, or ra|ther with the &s;hriek, of terror.&mdash;The mo&s;t profound &s;ilence followed. Caroline, trembling, &s;at down, and hid her face with her handkerchief. Lindorf remained petrified: at la&s;t, &s;tarting wild, and &s;triding about the room, he repeated again, "Married!"</P>
<P>Silence again en&s;ued.&mdash;And again &s;triking his fore|head, "No, it is impo&s;&s;ible, ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible; you deceive me, Caroline, you impo&s;e upon a wretch whom you have driven mad. Ah! cea&s;e, cea&s;e a &s;port &s;o cruel. Say, tell me, you are not married."</P>
<P>"It is but too true that I am," replied Caroline, al|mo&s;t fainting.</P>
<P>"But the Canone&s;s?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"She is ignorant of my marriage, I told you it as a &s;ecret."</P>
<P>"Oh! Caroline, Caroline!&mdash;Fatal &s;ecret! And I a confirmed and everla&s;ting wretch!"</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes he was in an agony that approached the wilde&s;t phren&s;y; he &s;at down, ro&s;e, tore his hair,
<PB N="73" REF="034126_0072_0FFA5804E8998E00">
groaned, gna&s;hed his teeth; every action denoted the fury and tempe&s;t within.</P>
<P>"Be calm, Lindorf, dear Lindorf, be calm! In the name of Heaven be calm! Do not thus give way to pa&s;|&s;ion! Am not I, al&s;o, &s;till more unhappy?"</P>
<P>"You! You unhappy! Caroline?"</P>
<P>Affection and tenderne&s;s ro&s;e at the &s;uppo&s;ition, and tears&mdash;ay, bitter tears &s;calded the manly cheek, and gave a little ea&s;e to the heart.&mdash;"Caroline," &s;aid he in a &s;ofter tone, "explain this &s;ecret, the di&s;covery of which is thus fatal. Who is this unknown, this inconceivable hu&s;|band; who thus can leave, thus neglect, the &s;upremity of mortal bli&s;s?"</P>
<P>Caroline, who &s;carce could &s;peak, &s;omewhat, however, con&s;oled, to &s;ee Lindorf more tranquil, gave a &s;uccinct relation of her marriage with a nobleman whom &s;he did not name. She re&s;pected the &s;ecret of Wal&s;tein, and gave not any indications by which he might be known. She only &s;aid that invincible repugnance for a match to which &s;he had &s;ubmitted, in obedience to her father, had occa&s;ioned her to entreat a &s;eparation, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time, which had been granted her, under condition of keeping it a &s;ecret. "Perhaps," &s;aid &s;he, "I forfeit one of my duties now by revealing it; but I tru&s;t I &s;hall care|fully fulfil every other, whatever pangs it may co&s;t my heart. Farewell, Lindorf, we mu&s;t &s;ee each other no more. Fly this fatal place, and if po&s;&s;ible, forget the unfortunate Caroline."</P>
<P>"Fly! Forget you!" replied Lindorf, who&s;e counte|nance was &s;omewhat changed by a ray of hope during the &s;hort recital of Caroline.&mdash;"No, never, never!&mdash;I &s;till &s;ee a po&s;&s;ibility, I &s;till dare hope for happine&s;s!"</P>
<P>"Lindorf!&mdash;Be careful what you &s;ay; grief cer|tainly has di&s;turbed your rea&s;on!"</P>
<P>"No, if thou wilt deign but to con&s;ent, bli&s;s may &s;till be mine&mdash;My deare&s;t Caroline, hear me&mdash;I know thy heart pleads in my behalf, in vain would&s;t thou forbid it; to me it appertains, by the ardour, the purity of affec|tion have I de&s;erved it, and my rights are far more &s;acred than tho&s;e of a tyrannical hu&s;band, who thus has abu&s;ed paternal authority; grant me but thy permi&s;&s;ion, and the&s;e hated bands &s;hall be broken; yes, they &s;hall; I dare affirm they &s;hall. The King is ju&s;t, he loves me, will
<PB N="74" REF="034126_0073_0FFA5740830BD0D0">
li&s;ten to me. Be&s;ide, I have a certain re&s;ource, a friend, a &s;upport that cannot fail."</P>
<P>"Unhappy Lindorf!" interrupted Caroline; "yield not to the&s;e chimeras. The King him&s;elf has forged the chains which no power can break; for who is there who&s;e intere&s;t may, for a moment, outweigh that of the Count of Wal&s;tein?"</P>
<P>Again Lindorf &s;tood the &s;tatue of amazement and dread! Again, the moment he could re&s;pire, he echoed&mdash; "Caroline!&mdash;The Count of Wal&s;tein!"</P>
<P>"The name has e&s;caped my lips," &s;aid Caroline, "and my only dependence is on your di&s;cretion. Judge then, what your hopes mu&s;t be, &s;ince it is he, Lindorf; yes, it is the Count of Wal&s;tein who is&mdash;my hu&s;band!"</P>
<P>Lindorf remained with his eyes fixed on the earth, his arms cro&s;&s;ed, his faculties wholly ab&s;orbed, and in thought &s;o deep as to &s;eem almo&s;t lifele&s;s; long he remained; but recovering, at length, from apparent &s;tupor, "Caroline," &s;aid he, fetching a deep and almo&s;t endle&s;s &s;igh, and with|out looking at her, "I mu&s;t leave you, Caroline, but I will return to-morrow morning; it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould &s;peak to you once more. To-morrow, here, in this &s;ame place, at this &s;ame hour, tell me, will you meet me?"</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered Caroline, &s;carcely knowing what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>"To-morrow, then," continued Lindorf, making a &s;tep to approach Caroline, but in&s;tantly recoiling, and &s;eizing his hat&mdash;"To-morrow"&mdash;He could &s;ay no more, but &s;uddenly fled.</P>
<P>Imagine what the condition, what the feelings were of Caroline, and what the crowded and confu&s;ed ideas that a&s;&s;ailed her heart. The fir&s;t, however, was the promi&s;e that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him once more. What could he have to &s;ay which he might not then have &s;aid? Wherefore, &s;o earne&s;tly, and with &s;uch &s;olemnity, entreat an inter|view to-morrow? She almo&s;t repented of the con&s;ent &s;he had given; and yet, could &s;he have refu&s;ed? Be&s;ide, it was po&s;&s;ible he had not abandoned the hope of obtain|ing a divorce, for he did not &s;ay he had; it therefore was nece&s;&s;ary to meet again, that &s;he might di&s;&s;uade him from all u&s;ele&s;s efforts, which could only end in di&s;covering their affection, and in rendering the mi&s;erable Caroline &s;till more mi&s;erable.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="034126_0074_0FFA581315E719F8">The reflection determined her to be punctual to the ap|pointed time, and at the appointed place. She afterwards began to think how difficult it would be longer to con|ceal the truth from the Canone&s;s. What would the ab|&s;ence of Lindorf lead her to &s;uppo&s;e? Caroline felt too how great the con&s;olation would be of giving her &s;orrows vent, and &s;hedding her tears in the bo&s;om of a friend &s;o tender and &s;o indulgent. Yet the promi&s;e they had re|quired of her had been &s;o &s;trong, &s;o po&s;itive, and the me|naced puni&s;hment was &s;o terrible, that without permi&s;&s;ion, &s;he dur&s;t not &s;peak. Her having betrayed it to Lindorf was enough, nay, too much; and nothing but the motives on which &s;he had acted could ju&s;tify her to her&s;elf. Yet the more &s;he reflected, the more &s;he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of informing the Barone&s;s; &s;he therefore determined, be the con&s;equence what it might, to write to her father, and beg permi&s;&s;ion to inform her. "It was no longer po&s;&s;i|ble," &s;he &s;aid, "to di&s;&s;emble with her dear Mamma, or to conceal her marriage. The ignorance of the Barone&s;s, concerning that event, expo&s;ed her to mo&s;t painful con|ver&s;ations, and which were continually repeated. Every moment ready to betray her&s;elf, &s;he mo&s;t humbly &s;uppli|cated permi&s;&s;ion to confe&s;s a &s;ecret which &s;ay too heavy on her heart, and which was an offence to the gratitude and friend&s;hip &s;he owed the Barone&s;s. And what was there to fear? The ill health of the Barone&s;s, her love of retirement, her ab&s;ence from all &s;ociety, made di&s;cre|tion certain; for to whom could &s;he &s;peak; &s;ince nobody &s;he &s;aw?&mdash;Be&s;ide," added Caroline, willing to prevent the vi&s;it and the per&s;ecution &s;he dreaded, "determined as I am not to leave her, &s;o long as &s;he lives, is it not a &s;hocking thing to be forbidden to &s;peak truth, and to open my heart to the dear friend who has been to me a mother? &mdash;Believe me, dear, dear Sir," continued &s;he, "to afflict you will doubly afflict my&s;elf; or to deprive you of a child, who, if &s;o you had plea&s;ed, never would have for&s;aken you, but to you would have con&s;ecrated her life, in proof of her affection; but you, Sir, thought proper otherwi&s;e to ordain: permit me, dear Sir, in my turn, to enjoy that liberty which my hu&s;band and King have granted, which was, that <HI>I might remain at Rindaw as long as I plea&s;ed;</HI> for &s;uch was the &s;entence, which I &s;hall never forget. My re&s;olution, Sir, is to remain here &s;o long as my only friend &s;hall live, to whom my cares and attentions may

be u&s;eful, and &s;o long as my heart and my rea&s;on &s;hall re|volt at the ties I have formed."</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ub&s;tance of the letter, which after ha|ving copied and &s;ent, Caroline found her&s;elf &s;omewhat relieved; her &s;ecret became le&s;s burthen&s;ome by the hope of being permitted to reveal it; and the idea of not be|holding the Count, for years to come, &s;omewhat con&s;oled her for the dreadful one of never beholding Lindorf more. It was, indeed, too much to feel the double torment of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nouncing the man &s;he loved, and living with the man &s;he hated; per&s;uaded that her fortitude would rid her of the latter misfortune, &s;he felt recovering &s;trength to &s;up|port the former.</P>
<P>"I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hall &s;ee him no more," &s;aid &s;he; "but though I &s;ee not him, I &s;hall be troubled with the &s;ight of no one el&s;e; and of him I may think uncea&s;ingly, here, in the&s;e groves, in this pavilion, which his pre&s;ence has rendered &s;o dear to memory."</P>
<P>Thus fortified, Caroline was able to &s;upport the con|ver&s;ation of the Canone&s;s and her que&s;tions, afflicting as they were; for &s;he every moment was inquiring if Caro|roline did not imagine Lindorf would come to-day, every moment was repeating her a&s;toni&s;hment that he had not been punctual to his promi&s;e. The di&s;order in her eyes, which &s;till increa&s;ed, prevented her from &s;eeing the ef|fects of her inquiries on the countenance of Caroline, who&s;e cheeks were flu&s;h and pale and continually varying, affected by a continued variety of di&s;tre&s;s, but this the Barone&s;s &s;aw not; &s;he &s;poke of nothing but the dear youth, was fearful le&s;t &s;ome misfortune had happened to him, and, in the evening, determined to &s;end the next day to make inquiries.</P>
<P>At length &s;he retired to her chamber, as did Caroline gladly to hers, in which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the night as &s;he had done the night before. At the appointed hour &s;he was at the pavilion; but Lindorf was not come. She waited half an hour, which &s;eemed half an age, and yet he came not. She opened the window, went out on the road, went to the entrance of the wood, and looked every way as far as &s;he could look; at length, &s;he beheld him co|ming. She ju&s;t had &s;trength enough to gain the pavilion, where &s;he &s;at her&s;elf down, unable to ri&s;e when he enter|ed, and could only return his &s;alutation by a &s;light incli|nation of the head.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="034126_0076_0FFA1B671909BAA0">Lindorf ob&s;erved her exce&s;&s;ive palene&s;s and dejection: he advanced, tremblingly, and without &s;peaking a &s;ingle word. When he was near her, he kneeled on one-knee and pre&s;ented her a packet, &s;ealed up, and a box contain|ing a miniature picture. He bowed and, ri&s;ing, recover|ed &s;ufficient &s;trength to &s;ay, in a low and half &s;uffocated voice, "Accept the&s;e from a friend.&mdash;Farewell! Ca|roline, farewell! may you be happy!" Then, re&s;pect|fully, though not without pa&s;&s;ion, twice ki&s;&s;ing her hand, he ro&s;e, put his handkerchief to his eyes, and left the pavilion.</P>
<P>Had not the packet and the box remained, Caroline would have imagined &s;he had &s;een an apparition, &s;o &s;ud|denly and &s;o &s;trangely had he di&s;appeared. With wild &s;tupor her looks followed Lindorf; and no &s;ooner was he gone than, her arms in&s;tinctively extending them&s;elves towards the door, Caroline exclaimed, "Oh Lindorf! Lindorf!"</P>
<P>Lindorf heard her not, Lindorf &s;aw her not, Lindorf, alas! was no longer there. She ro&s;e precipitately, let the packet and the box fall from her lap, on which they had been placed, and ran to the window, where &s;he &s;aw Lin|dorf as if flying from an enemy, or &s;truck with panic fear. He was pre&s;ently out of &s;ight, and the tears of Caroline began abundantly to &s;tream down her cheeks. It was well they did; for, in all probability, they prevented fainting, and, perhaps, wor&s;e con&s;equences.</P>
<P>"It is pa&s;t," &s;aid &s;he, "I &s;hall &s;ee him no more. To me he is forever lo&s;t."</P>
<P>Her &s;obs interrupted &s;peech, and almo&s;t re&s;piration; and again her tears began to cour&s;e each other with greater violence. At length &s;he remembered the packet and the box, which Lindorf had left, and which were lying at her feet. In the&s;e, no doubt, &s;he would find &s;omething that might explain this &s;ingular and my&s;terious farewell; &s;he took the box up fir&s;t. It is his image, the portrait of Lindorf, thought &s;he, as &s;he was endeavouring to open it. "And thinke&s;t thou I have need of &s;uch aid to recollect thee, Lindorf?"</P>
<P>Yet was it a con&s;olation to po&s;&s;e&s;s his picture, the value of which &s;he fully felt, and the recollection made her open the box witn eagerne&s;s.&mdash;How great was her &s;ur|pri&s;e!&mdash;It was the uniform of Lindorf, it was a Captain
<PB N="78" REF="034126_0077_0FFA57520A5241F8">
of the guards, it was a mo&s;t hand&s;ome man, but it was not her lover; a per&s;on entirely different from Lindorf, and to her entirely unknown. She in&s;tantly &s;hut the box again, threw it with anger on the table, and took up the packet.</P>
<P>"Let us &s;ee," &s;aid &s;he, "if this incomprehen&s;ible man has explained what this may mean. Who&s;e is this por|trait? Wherefore leave, why give it me?" The &s;eals of the packet were pre&s;ently broken, and in it &s;he found a manu&s;cript in the hand-writing of Lindorf. Caroline was &s;o much affected that &s;he began to read without at all comprehending what &s;he read; at length, however, her &s;cattered thoughts were &s;omewhat collected, and, &s;eating her&s;elf at the window, &s;he took up the manu&s;cript, and again began to read.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>"Fini&s;hed this morning at nine o'clock."</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"GENERAL WALSTEIN, father of the Amba&s;&s;ador, having travelled to England in his youth, he there &s;aw Lady Matilda Seymour, whom he loved, who&s;e hand he a&s;ked in marriage and obtained, and whom he brought to Pru&s;&s;ia, where he made her the happie&s;t of women. Two children were the &s;ole fruits of this union; the fir&s;t a &s;on, the pre&s;ent Count, and the only remaining male of the family, which, if he dies childle&s;s, will, with him be|come extinct. This &s;on was, therefore, the greate&s;t ble&s;|&s;ing Heaven could be&s;tow on his parents. Twelve years after he was born they had a daughter, who&s;e tardy and unexpected birth was the death of her mother. The event threw the General into the deepe&s;t melancholy; he had adored his lady, and remained faithful to her memory; for, though &s;till young, he vowed never again to marry, but to con&s;ecrate the remainder of his days to the &s;ervice of his country and the education of his children.</P>
<P>"The daughter, to whom the name of Matilda had been given, was committed to the care of the General's &s;i&s;ters, one of whom had married the Baron of Za&s;trow, a Saxo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gentleman, but living then at Berlin; &s;o that the child
<PB N="79" REF="034126_0078_0FFA58239C3DD3F0">
was &s;till under her father's eye. His &s;on, conducted through the paths of honour and virtue by him&s;elf, gave &s;igns, in earlie&s;t infancy, of what he &s;hould one day be|come, and in&s;pired his tender father with the &s;weet and certain hope of hereafter fully recompen&s;ing all his cares.</P>
<P>"But, alas! this happy father lived not to the full enjoyment of a plea&s;ure &s;o &s;upreme. War broke out be|tween Au&s;tria and Pru&s;&s;ia. The General commanded a part of the victorious Pru&s;&s;ians, and the King had already di&s;tingui&s;hed him as one of his greate&s;t generals, when he had the happine&s;s to prove his unbounded attachment and zeal to his Maje&s;ty, by &s;acrificing his own life, at the bat|tle of Molviez, and &s;aving that of his Sovereign. The King, depending wholly on his courage, and neglecting his &s;afe|ty, was in the utmo&s;t danger; pur&s;ued by &s;everal Au&s;trian hu&s;&s;ars, his hor&s;e had been wounded and could not fly, and him&s;elf ran the ri&s;k of either being taken or killed. General Wal&s;tein was the &s;ole per&s;on who &s;aw the danger attended by his &s;on, then in his &s;ixteenth year, and ma|king his campaign, in the company of his father, as a &s;imple volunteer. The general intercepted the hu&s;&s;ars; the young Count flew to the king with his hor&s;e, while his father wounded, or put to flight, the pur&s;uers, and him&s;elf received the mortal blow which el&s;e, perhaps, had de&s;cended on the Monarch.</P>
<P>"Some officers came up, among whom my father was, who was the General's mo&s;t intimate friend, and they and young Wal&s;tein bore his father to his tent. The King, in con&s;ternation, followed; and the &s;urgeons, having examined the wound, declared he had only a few moments to live. His &s;on, kneeling by his bed&s;ide, gave way to grief the mo&s;t unbounded; and ince&s;&s;antly repeated, "Oh! my father, my dear father, why was it not me they killed!" The general collected the little remaining &s;trength he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to con&s;ole and recommend his &s;on to the King. "I commit him, Sir," &s;aid he, "into your hands; he has partook my peril and my glory; and he, like me, will learn to live and die in the defence of his King and country. You will be to him a father, be faithful to you as I have been, and thus both to you and him I &s;hall be replaced.&mdash;And for you, young man, weep not; &s;hew more fortitude, and envy the glorious death I die. In&s;tead of grieving, think of de&s;erving, by your courage, the augu&s;t father to whom I dying confide you."</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="034126_0079_0FFA1AD1AE6CCFB8">"Yes," &s;aid the King, exceedingly affected, cla&s;ping the young Count in his arms, "I will be a father to him, and never, &s;o long as I live, will forget that for my &s;ake he lo&s;t his own. He &s;hall henceforth be my &s;on and friend; and, to prove it, I now, in&s;tantly, give him a commi&s;&s;ion in the guards, which will fix his re&s;idence near me, during his youth, and which is but the beginning of the good I intend."</P>
<P>"The young Count, wholly devoted to affliction, an|&s;wered not; perhaps, did not hear what the King had &s;aid. Gratitude and happine&s;s however again were vi&s;ible in the countenance of the expiring General, and anima|tion once more to tho&s;e eyes which the &s;hades of death had half ob&s;cured; he &s;tretched out one hand to his King and the other to his &s;on, and, making a la&s;t effort, &s;aid to the latter&mdash;"My &s;on&mdash;your &s;i&s;ter&mdash;my dear little Matilda&mdash; to you I confide her and the care of her future happine&s;s &mdash;Poor girl!&mdash;But you will love, you will be a father."</P>
<P>"He could &s;ay no more. The young Count would have replied, but ince&s;&s;ant &s;obs choaked up utterance; he only could ki&s;s the General's hand, which he did with &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;m of affliction as might well a&s;&s;ure the dying fa|ther of the love and obedience of the &s;on. Alas! that hand was already cold, and the next moment the breath departed from the General, who lay reclined in the arms of <HI>my</HI> father, to whom, likewi&s;e, expiring, he &s;aid, "Lin|dorf, you love my children. Oh! my King, my &s;on, my friend, grieve not for me, for I die the happie&s;t of &s;ub|jects and of fathers."</P>
<P>"Perhaps, Madam, the&s;e affecting incidents are not unknown to you, but, if &s;o, I &s;till thought it my duty, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to recall them to your memory. Yet I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e you wholly unacquainted with them, and that they will make the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion on you they did on me when my father, a witne&s;s of this affecting &s;cene, has taken plea&s;ure in recounting it to me. How has it warmed my heart! How has it incited admi|ration and a de&s;ire to emulate the young hero who, at &s;o tender an age, had &s;aved the life of his King, and di&s;co|vered &s;o much courage and &s;en&s;ibility! With what ardo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> did I de&s;ire to become acquainted with him, attach my&s;elf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to him, and imitate his virtues as far as for me imitation was po&s;&s;ible! How often have I entreated my father to take me to Berlin, that I might &s;olicit the King to permit
<PB N="81" REF="034126_0080_0FFA1B71E27CDB80">
the young Count of Wal&s;tein to come and pa&s;s &s;ome months at our hou&s;e!</P>
<P>"My father's ill health had obliged him to quit the &s;er|vice a few years after the death of the General; &s;ince which time he con&s;tantly remained at an e&s;tate which lies in the farther part of Sile&s;ia. Several years were pa&s;&s;ed there before the pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire I had to &s;ee the Count could be gratified; I was too young to appear at court, and being engaged in my &s;tudies, the&s;e could not be in|terrupted; nor could my father, notwith&s;tanding his fre|quent &s;olicitations, prevail on the King to &s;uffer his a|dopted &s;on out of his &s;ight, for whom his attachment daily increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Never, perhaps, was there &s;o great a favourite, and never, perhaps, was there &s;o de&s;erving a one. Far from profiting by their partiality of his ma&s;ter, and accumulat|ing wealth and honours to him&s;elf, he &s;ought only to make others happy; and, in&s;tead of being envied, was adored. The name of the young Count of Wal&s;tein was never pronounced without affection and prai&s;e; every father propo&s;ed him as a model to his &s;ons, and every mother wi&s;hed him the hu&s;band of her daughter; though few, indeed, might flatter her&s;elf with &s;uch a hope. The King openly &s;aid he him&s;elf would give him a wife, and the King de&s;tined the mo&s;t amiable of women for Wal|&s;tein.</P>
<P>"Oh, Caroline! Caroline!&mdash;Yet, have I a right to murmur?&mdash;No, you ought to appertain to the be&s;t of men; you, only, could reward the virtues of Wal&s;tein, and Wal&s;tein, only, could merit you.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t, the long-wi&s;hed for moment of meeting the Count arrived. Returning from a mo&s;t fatiguing cam|paign, young Wal&s;tein, having need of re&s;t, added his entreaties to tho&s;e of my father, and &s;upplicated per|mi&s;&s;ion of the King to pa&s;s apart of the &s;ummer at Rone|bourg, the e&s;tate at which my father re&s;ided. The King had not the power to refu&s;e him any thing, and his re|que&s;t was granted, though reluctantly. I heard the news with tran&s;port. He came, and I found that Fame, in|&s;tead of having exaggerated, was &s;till far beneath the truth. The Count was in the very prime of life; he was then four-and-twenty, and to the mo&s;t dignified figure, and features the mo&s;t beautiful, he added a countenance incredibly expre&s;&s;ive; his eyes were the very mirror of

his mind; in them were painted benevolence and &s;en&s;i|bility, and, whenever any trait of virtue or of courage was related, they perfectly fla&s;hed with animation and plea&s;ure; he was tall, his legs were remarkably hand&s;ome, nor is it impo&s;&s;ible to convey the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations that the &s;ymmetry of his per&s;on and his whole appearance in|&s;pired.</P>

<P>Tears and contending pa&s;&s;ions took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul of Caroline, obliged her to re&s;t, and the manu&s;cript dropped from her hands. She ca&s;t her eyes on the box th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> contained the portrait, comprehended who&s;e it once was, reached out her arm to take it, and, without daring to touch it, as &s;uddenly drew back. The palpitations of her heart were violent, her ideas di&s;ordered, her imagi|nation bewildered, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to recollect her|&s;elf, for a moment, ere &s;he could again begin reading.&mdash; She &s;ighed profoundly, dried up her tears, once more glanced at the box, again turned her eyes away, took up the manu&s;cript, and continued with an emotion that aug|mented at every line:</P>
<P>"I was in my nineteenth year when Wal&s;tein came to Ronebourg, and, notwith&s;tanding the difference of age and &s;ituation, his kindne&s;s outran my hopes by the mo&s;t delicate offers of friend&s;hip, which, to me, was as nece&s;|&s;ary as it was flattering; for I then &s;tood in the utmo&s;t need of a friend. My heart panted after &s;ome one who could under&s;tand it, to whom it could open it&s;elf, and who could participate its feelings. I was di&s;tractedly in love&mdash;Yet, no, it is profanation &s;o to u&s;e the word. I loved not. I have &s;ince too well known what love re|ally is, &s;o to confound the two &s;en&s;ations&mdash;But I was ardently, inordinately, de&s;irous of obtaining a young wo|man of ab&s;olutely ob&s;cure birth; yet, who&s;e beauty might
<PB N="83" REF="034126_0082_0FFA5839959AFD98">
have placed her on a throne. Yes, Caroline, Loui&s;a was indeed beautiful; &s;he mu&s;t have been, otherwi&s;e, I could not think her &s;o now, could not tell you &s;o at this moment."</P>
<P>The heart of Caroline had undergone &s;uch variety of trials, and &s;o &s;evere, that it is not wonderful &s;he felt her|&s;elf affected at this place. She leaned back, for a mo|ment, on her chair; had recour&s;e to her &s;melling-bottle, and, when &s;he was &s;omewhat recovered, again went on:</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a was the daughter of an invalid &s;erjeant (my father held it a duty to maintain a certain number of in|valids) and one of my mother's maids. The old couple lived a quarter of a league from Ronebourg, on a &s;mall farm, which my parents had given them as a reward for pa&s;t &s;ervices. During my childhood I was continually with them, continually in the arms of the good Cicely, who had nur&s;ed me, and who loved me as dearly as &s;he did her own &s;on, Fritz; who, in the&s;e my boyi&s;h days, was my intimate friend. Loui&s;a, younger by &s;ome years than he, was &s;till dearer to me; for I could not quit the farm of the good Jo&s;&s;elin, her father, nor live &s;eparate from her a moment; and when they &s;ent me to the Univer&s;ity I &s;hed as many tears at taking leave of Cicely, Jo&s;&s;elin, and, particularly, the little Loui&s;a, as in quitting the hou&s;e of my father.</P>
<P>"I obtained permi&s;&s;ion to take Fritz with me. I was ignorant, then, that this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d was, naturally, as vile and de|ceitful as his parents were hone&s;t; or, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, his ba&s;ene&s;s was not at that time come to maturity. I &s;aw him acute, active, faithful, and zealous for my &s;er|vice and my intere&s;ts. He was the &s;on of my nur&s;e, the brother of Loui&s;a. How many claims, therefore, had he on my confidence and love! They were not forgotten, and he was e&s;teemed rather as a friend than as a dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>"Some years &s;tay at Erlang greatly enfeebled the re|membrance of the farm, and the plea&s;ures of childhood; yet were they occa&s;ionally revived by letters that Fritz received from his &s;i&s;ter, and &s;hewed me. The&s;e always contained &s;ome &s;hort article concerning her young ma&s;|ter, which was &s;o tenderly expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;he recommend|ed Fritz &s;o urgently to love him, to &s;erve him faithfully, a&s;ked &s;o earne&s;tly concerning his health and welfare, that I melted while I read them, and felt great impati|ence again&punc; to &s;ee her by whom they were written.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="034126_0083_0FFA5767697C6838">"Among them came one which informed Fritz of the death of his mother, my good and dear nur&s;e. The grief of Loui&s;a was real and affecting, and painted with &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility, an energy &s;o powerful, and &s;o native to a no|ble heart, that, at hearing it read, the mo&s;t rugged na|ture mu&s;t have been moved. I too, was &s;incerely afflicted for her who, ever &s;ince my birth, had be&s;towed the mo&s;t tender attentions on me. I wept her death more than Fritz, and was far le&s;s ea&s;ily con&s;oled. I have &s;ince re|collected that one day, when I &s;poke of my &s;orrow for the death of his mother, a phra&s;e e&s;caped him which I did not then interpret as I do now. "You may &s;ee Lou|i&s;a with much le&s;s difficulty," &s;aid he. Had age and ex|perience better taught me, this would have &s;ufficiently unveiled his odious character; but I, at that time, pre&s;er|ved that &s;weet innocence which &s;uffers us not to &s;u&s;pect evil.</P>
<P>"A &s;hort time after I was recalled home. I returned to Ronebourg, and arrived there &s;ome months before the vi&s;it of the young Count of Wal&s;tein took place.&mdash;The very next day I ran to the farm of Jo&s;&s;elin, accompanied by Fritz; but, good God! what were my feelings when I beheld Loui&s;a, and &s;aw the amazing change which a few years had made in her per&s;on! Never before had I beheld a being &s;o beauteous. She was in mourning, and her black ve&s;t, while it marked her ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t form and &s;hewed her &s;lender &s;hape more &s;lender, gave a fine contra&s;t to one of the fine&s;t complexions Nature ever be&s;towed. Her cheeks glowed with animation and plea&s;ure at the return of her brother and young ma&s;ter; her large dark eyes were powerfully and affectingly expre&s;&s;ive; and her hair, black as the ribband by which it was decorated, falling in large tre&s;&s;es on each &s;ide, made fre&s;hne&s;s look more fre&s;h, and added brighthe&s;s to the vivid colours of youth.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Caroline for thus dwelling on circum|&s;tances which, to you, cannot be very intere&s;ting; and which now, to me, are become only indifferent, except as they may prove &s;ome alleviation to exce&s;&s;es into which a mo&s;t ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion hurried me; for never can my crime find forgivene&s;s, unle&s;s in the &s;uperiority of that beauty by which it was in&s;pired; its effects, alas were the mo&s;t &s;udden and the mo&s;t deplorable!</P>
<P>"When I &s;et out for the farm, I had re&s;olved, in the gaiety of my heart, to let Loui&s;a gue&s;s which of the two
<PB N="85" REF="034126_0084_0FFA5842AB621828">
was her brother; and had, therefore, dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf nearly like him; but the ec&s;tacy, the trouble, the de&s;ires, of my &s;oul, pre&s;ently betrayed me. Fritz laughed, and &s;aw, with joy, the impre&s;&s;ion his &s;i&s;ter had made on me. Loui&s;a ran with open arms and plea&s;ure in her eyes; but, &s;uddenly &s;topping when &s;he came to me, &s;he made me a ru&s;tic courte&s;y, which I thought all grace, and, falling on her brother's neck, melted into tears.</P>
<P>"I was as much affected as &s;he, and the good old Jo&s;|&s;elin came to add to our emotion. He received me with tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect; we went into the hou&s;e, and there he &s;poke to me of Cicely, the manner of her death, the greatne&s;s of his affliction, and recited all &s;he had &s;aid, in her dying moments, relative to Fritz and me. I wi&s;hed to an&s;wer, but I could only behold Loui&s;a and weep with her. Jo&s;&s;elin, afterwards, talked of his children, and a&s;ked if I was &s;atisfied with his &s;on, "As for Loui&s;a," &s;aid he, "&s;he is a good girl; &s;he takes care of me and the hou&s;ehold affairs, and &s;upplies the place of her mother better than could be expected; &s;o long as &s;he continues prudent, and her brother behaves well, I &s;hall be ea&s;y and happy, and, after a while, &s;hall, in my turn, again go and meet my dear Cicely. When I am gone, I tru&s;t to God and my Lord the Baron to take care of my &s;mall family, in whom, my children, I hope you will find con&s;olation for the lo&s;s of your poor old father."</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a ran into hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> arms. Fritz, al&s;o approached, but he appeared to me but feebly moved: or, rather, I beheld Loui&s;a, the beauteous, the affectionate, the tender Loui&s;a; and I could have wi&s;hed, like her, to have kneeled to the old man, to have called him my father al&s;o, to have taken his hands and have pre&s;&s;ed them to my lips. The father of Loui&s;a was to me, at that moment, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of beings.</P>
<P>"It was time that a &s;cene &s;o affecting &s;hould fini&s;h. My heart was overcharged, and might not contain all the&s;e thronging &s;en&s;ations, and I left the farm, bearing, in this captivated heart, the image of Loui&s;a and the fever of love. Fritz perceived all this, becau&s;e he waited and wi&s;hed it all. A connection between his &s;i&s;ter and me made him &s;uppo&s;e my favour certain, and his own fortune made. Perhaps, his ambition went farther &s;till, and flattered him he might become the brother of his ma&s;ter. His ba&s;e and intere&s;ted mind regarded not the di&s;honour
<PB N="86" REF="034126_0085_0FFA1ADDCB73B788">
of his family, or of mine, if he only could receive benefit thereby; he, therefore, took every means in his power to blow up the flame by which I was devoured, and in which he &s;ucceeded but too well.</P>
<P>"Is not Loui&s;a, well grown and exceedingly hand|&s;ome, Sir," &s;aid he, "What a pity would it be if &s;ome &s;tupid lout &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a trea&s;ure of charms? For my part, I verily believe I &s;hould rather &s;ee her the mi&s;|tre&s;s of a great Lord, like you, than the wife of a ru&s;tic who would never know half her worth."</P>
<P>"This, and other &s;imilar conver&s;ation, di&s;gu&s;ted me not, though it would have done, no doubt, before I had &s;een Loui&s;a. The dear idea of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her, no matter by what means, tran&s;ported me; and I, every day, &s;wal|lowed deeper draughts of the poi&s;on by which my feeble heart was infected; every day went to the farm, under the pretext of cour&s;ing or &s;hooting, and was always kindly received by Jo&s;&s;elin and his daughter, when they were together. As &s;oon as I arrived, Loui&s;a would run to the dairy, fetch me a bowl of milk, cut me &s;ome brown bread and &s;ometimes eat with me. The good Jo&s;&s;elin would recount his ancient exploits and campaigns, while emp|tying his bottle of beer. I feigned to li&s;ten, while my eyes were continually &s;earching Loui&s;a, and devouring her beauties; and never could I leave the place without an increa&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"If I found her alone, all her former plea&s;ing atten|tions, all that air of friend&s;hip and &s;atisfaction were gone, and a marked embarra&s;&s;ment was ever apparent. She be|gan a &s;entence and left it unfini&s;hed; &s;ometimes &s;eemed affected, and ready to weep; then, no longer ma&s;ter of my&s;elf, would I approach her with ec&s;tacy, venture &s;ome little liberties, and recal to her mind the &s;ports of our in|fancy. But &s;he ever rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lled me with &s;o firm, &s;o &s;eri|ous, &s;o decided a tone, that it awed my audacity, and in|&s;pired head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ion with fear.</P>
<P>"When I returned home I would complain to Fritz of his &s;i&s;ter's re&s;erve, conjure him to &s;ee her, to &s;peak in my favour, and to prevail on her to grant me more of her friend&s;hip and confidence. He would laugh, and a&s;&s;ure me I was beloved, pa&s;&s;ionately beloved, that he knew it well from the confu&s;ion in which Loui&s;a always appeared when we were alone, which was a certain proof. "But
<PB N="87" REF="034126_0086_0FFA1BAFA029CB90">
the&s;e young girls," &s;aid he, "who, in fact, only wi&s;h to yield, wi&s;h to have &s;ome excu&s;e for yielding."</P>
<P>"Emboldened by this hope, I would return to the farm. If Jo&s;&s;elin was pre&s;ent I was received with every po&s;&s;ible kindne&s;s; if not, the &s;ame continual embarra&s;&s;|ment took place, and, if I became pre&s;&s;ing, the &s;ame re|&s;i&s;tance. This conduct drove me to de&s;pair, and my love, at length, knew no bounds.</P>
<P>"Such was the trouble and efferve&s;cence of my pa&s;|&s;ions when the Count of Wal&s;tein came to Ronebourg. Loui&s;a was the whole world to me, for Loui&s;a only I ex|i&s;ted, and 'Loui&s;a I mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s, or die,' was the conti|nual exclamation of my heart. The very reputation of the Count for prudence was &s;ufficient to deter me, for &s;ome days, from making any avowal of my pa&s;&s;ion. At fir&s;t I was afraid of his over powerful rea&s;on, but the Count knew &s;o well how to conceal his own &s;uperiority that he him&s;elf &s;eemed uncon&s;cious of it. His mind, while it was &s;trong and &s;ublime, was &s;o gentle and affec|tionate, and to a ripened wi&s;dom of age he &s;o naturally added all the graces and vivacity of youth, that after a &s;hort acquaintance, all fear and con&s;traint were gone.</P>
<P>"His indulgent nature was &s;o conciliating, &s;o winning, that, one day, as we were walking together, and he was rallying me on the ab&s;ence, the apparent di&s;traction of my thoughts, I ventured to inform him of the cau&s;e, and to open my whole heart. To him I made a recital much like that you ju&s;t have read; I omitted no circum|&s;tance, and all was repeated with that warmth, and en|thu&s;ia&s;m which well were de&s;criptive of the pa&s;&s;ion by which I was devoured, while he &s;eemed to li&s;ten with the utmo&s;t emotion and concern. When I had ended, he took me by the hand, and cla&s;ping it with all the &s;ym|pathy of affection, "O Lindorf," &s;aid he, "my too youthful, too tender friend, what a mountain of affliction art thou heaping on thy&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"He was proceeding to give me &s;ome advice, but I in|terrupted him. "It is not advice," &s;aid I, "dear Count, that I a&s;k; it is compa&s;&s;ion and indulgence, it is your con&s;ent to &s;ee my Loui&s;a, and, till you have &s;een her, not to pa&s;s judgment on me." So &s;aying, I forcibly drew him towards the farm.</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a was alone, and very melancholy. She appear|ed as if &s;he had been weeping, but this only made the
<PB N="88" REF="034126_0087_0FFA576E38F5DD08">
greater impre&s;&s;ion on me; the &s;urpri&s;e of &s;eeing a &s;tran|ger, as we entered, &s;pread her beautiful face with mode&s;t blu&s;hes; and her timidity and embarra&s;&s;ment heightened her charms. She recovered her&s;elf, and received us as well as po&s;&s;ible. I ob&s;erved &s;he often looked at the Count, and that &s;ighs occa&s;ionally e&s;caped her which &s;he endeavoured to repre&s;s. As for Wal&s;tein, he beheld her with a&s;toni&s;hment, and turned, afterwards, and looked on me with eyes of affliction.</P>
<P>"We took a walk round the little kitchen garden of Loui&s;a. There were a few flowers intermingled, and &s;he gathered each of us a violet. I could not help ob&s;erving &s;he gave the fine&s;t of them to my friend; but, certainly, this was nothing more than politene&s;s, and I could not be jealous of the Count, whom &s;he had never &s;een be|fore; no, I was only plea&s;ed that &s;he behaved &s;o as might be&s;t obtain his good opinion. Nothing, I ob&s;erved, e&s;|caped him; the good order of her little garden, the neat|ne&s;s of her per&s;on, and the cleanline&s;s of her hou&s;e; he &s;aw them all, and felt them all.</P>
<P>"We took our leave, and, at a little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, met Jo&s;&s;elin who was returning from the fields. His long white hair and venerable figure &s;truck the Count. "This," &s;aid I, "is the father of Loui&s;a." Jo&s;|&s;elin came up, and &s;poke &s;ome time with his u&s;ual good &s;en&s;e; after which we parted, and continued our way. I walked be&s;ide the Count without uttering a word, my anxious and inqui&s;itive eyes endeavoured to penetrate his thoughts, but he likewi&s;e kept &s;ilence. At length, I could forbear no longer&mdash;"Well, my dear Count, tell me, am I &s;o very culpable for adoring Loui&s;a?"</P>
<P>"Not, at pre&s;ent," replied he; "you are yet only un|fortunate; &s;he de&s;erves to be adored"&mdash;Then tenderly embracing me, "No, you are not culpable," added he, but, perhaps, another day, and you may be&mdash;Fly dear Lindorf, fly that dangerous girl; there is no other po&s;&s;i|ble re&s;ource. If the mo&s;t &s;incere, the mo&s;t tender friend|&s;hip may any way &s;often the pangs of love, mine &s;hall be wholly yours. I will not for&s;ake you, will go with you to Berlin, or take you to my own e&s;tate, or, in fine, wherever you plea&s;e, provided it be far enough from Ronebourg."</P>
<P>"Fly!" &s;aid I, "Fly Loui&s;a! Live without Loui&s;a! No, never, never."</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="034126_0088_0FFA584D93B8CC30">"And what, in the name of heaven," replied the Count, with ardour, "do you think of doing? What are your hopes? Do you mean to <HI>marry her?</HI>&mdash;Remember your parents, and think whether you al&s;o mean to <HI>mur|der them.</HI>&mdash;Do you wi&s;h to &s;educe her? I cannot &s;uppo&s;e you would entertain an idea &s;o di&s;honorable, &s;o abhorrent. Loui&s;a is the picture of virtue and innocence. And her re&s;pectable aged father, who e&s;teems, who loves, who receives you as if you were his own &s;on, would you betray the confidence he repo&s;es in you by bearing that from him which of all things on earth is to him the mo&s;t precious? No, Lindorf, you never can be guilty of an act &s;o atrocious. Lindorf will li&s;ten to the voice of ho|nour, of rea&s;on, of true friend&s;hip, and if he &s;hed tears, they &s;hall not be the di&s;tracting tears of guilty remor&s;e."</P>
<P>"The features, the voice, the eyes of the Count a&s;|&s;umed an expre&s;&s;ion and energy which are impo&s;&s;ible for me to convey; and with conviction irre&s;i&s;table a&s;&s;ailed the heart. A Deity &s;eemed &s;peaking! A &s;upreme intel|ligence, de&s;cended from heaven to enlighten and &s;ave! Every word he pronounced was &s;o different from what I daily heard from Fritz, and I had been &s;o little accu&s;|tomed to behold my pa&s;&s;ion under &s;o criminal a point of view, that I was ab&s;olutely &s;truck &s;peechle&s;s, and &s;tood before him aba&s;hed. The Count ob&s;erved me, knew what was pa&s;&s;ing in my mind, and, tenderly taking me by the hand, I &s;ee," &s;aid he, "the rea&s;ons I have urged have made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on you, and that virtue will &s;oon regain her empire. Come, my friend, come with me, and a&s;k your father's permi&s;&s;ion to travel awhile. We will depart to-morrow."</P>
<P>"To-morrow!" cried I, in all the pangs of returning pa&s;&s;ion, "depart to-morrow! From Loui&s;a! See her no more! Ignorant whether I am beloved, whether I ever may &s;ee her again! No, Wal&s;tein, no; hope it not; it is too much; it is at once to plunge a dagger to my heart." Then, leaning my head again&s;t a tree, and &s;hedding tears, I added, "I feel the force of what you have &s;aid: it is but too true. Ah! wherefore had I not a friend like you in the beginning of this fatal pa&s;&s;ion? But it is now too late, a devouring fire &s;corches me up, and now I feel, too powerfully feel, there is no alterna|tive but Loui&s;a or death&mdash;Yet I will endeavour, in part,
<PB N="90" REF="034126_0089_0FFA1AEF534C5E60">
to follow your advice; to remain &s;ome days without &s;ee|ing her, without going to the farm; but let me have the con&s;olation of being near her.&mdash;Alas! dear Sir, I am a &s;ick man, to whom nur&s;ing and precaution are nece&s;&s;ary, and whom a remedy too violent would immediately kill."</P>
<P>"The Count owned I was right, and mildly endea|voured to calm and con&s;ole me. He remained &s;atisfied with the promi&s;e, which I repeated, of not going for &s;ome days to the farm, and no doubt hoped, by degrees, to bring me to con&s;ent to a longer ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>"In the evening I complained of not being well, that I might thus impo&s;e an obligation upon my&s;elf of keeping my chamber; for I felt, if I &s;hould leave it, my feet would, in&s;tinctively, conduct me to Loui&s;a; but a feign|ed &s;ickne&s;s would deprive me of the liberty of going. Yet could it not be &s;aid to be feigned; for I, for &s;everal days pa&s;t, had had an inward fever, the u&s;ual con&s;equence of violent pa&s;&s;ions. I &s;lept little, and ate le&s;s; this ex|ce&s;&s;ive change alarmed my parents, but I a&s;&s;ured them a few days re&s;t and proper care would pre&s;ently re&s;tore me. Wal&s;tein failed not highly to prai&s;e my fortitude, left me but &s;eldom, and, while with me, took every means to increa&s;e and give force to rea&s;on, and greatly relieved the torment of pa&s;&s;ion; but the moment he left me it as &s;uddenly re&s;umed its empire, to which Fritz, indeed, was continually aiding, by his in&s;inuations and di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>"He had perceived, from &s;ome few words he had heard, and even from what had e&s;caped me my&s;elf, that the Count oppo&s;ed my love for Loui&s;a; and this fellow was, therefore, only the more indu&s;trious to keep it alive and enflamed. Nor were any great efforts nece&s;&s;ary; for no &s;ooner was I ever alone with him than I began, in &s;pite of all my endeavours to be &s;ilent, to &s;peak of his &s;i&s;ter. He a&s;&s;ured me &s;he &s;ecretly moaned my ab&s;ence and my indi&s;po&s;ition, and that, for four days, during which &s;he had not &s;een me, &s;he had done nothing but weep. "Poor girl! 'tis quite piteous to &s;ee her, my Lord; &s;he loves you to di&s;traction; and then &s;he keeps it all to her&s;elf; no &s;oul but I <HI>knows</HI> it, but I <HI>does</HI> all I can to comfort her; I <HI>tells</HI> her &s;he is not the fir&s;t country la&s;s that has loved a great Lord, and I <HI>&s;ays,</HI> how happy &s;he would be with you; for, to be &s;ure, you are &s;o good, and &s;o generous, that, certainly, you would never for|&s;ake her."</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="034126_0090_0FFA585584AAC748">"The&s;e kind of conver&s;ations, continually repeated, too potently contributed to increa&s;e pa&s;&s;ion and enfeeble fortitude. One day, the fifth or &s;ixth of my retreat, the Count having left me to go a &s;hooting, and Fritz having &s;poken for a whole hour of Loui&s;a and her love for me, unable any longer to re&s;i&s;t, I broke loo&s;e, like a child who&s;e guardian had left him to him&s;elf, and flew to the farm, hoping to be back before the return of the Count.</P>
<P>"Jo&s;&s;elin was gone to the field, and Loui&s;a left alone in the hou&s;e. Her wheel &s;tood by her, yet was &s;he not &s;pinning, but, leaning on her elbows, &s;he had covered her eyes with her handkerchief. At fir&s;t &s;he did not perceive me, but, hearing the noi&s;e the &s;hutting-to of the door made, &s;he looked up, and exclaimed, blu&s;hing, "Good God! my Lord, is it you? I was told you were very ill, and am exceedingly glad to &s;ee that"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I did not give her time to fini&s;h her &s;entence; the affection which I imagined the&s;e few words contained, her blu&s;hes, and her eyes, red and humid with tears, all confirmed me every thing Fritz had told me concerning her love was true. Enchanted, in ec&s;tacies, at &s;eeing her again, and at &s;eeing her thus &s;oft and tender, I flung my&s;elf at her feet, and knew not what I &s;aid. No long|er ma&s;ter of my rea&s;on, I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with &s;uch en|thu&s;ia&s;m and fire, that Loui&s;a was terrified, but &s;he could neither &s;top me nor break from me; I had &s;eized both her hands, which, with great agitation and force, I held, while I devoured them with my ki&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t at this in&s;tant the door opened, and in came the Count&mdash;I know not which of the three &s;eemed mo&s;t confounded. The &s;urpri&s;e of being thus caught made me quit Loui&s;a's hands, who, the moment &s;he was free, fled precipitately; I ro&s;e, but dur&s;t not look up at Wal|&s;tein&mdash;At length, "Are you here, Lindorf?" &s;aid he, "I left you in your chamber, and I find you at the feet of Loui&s;a?"</P>
<P>"Then you did not come to &s;eek me?" replied I; with amazement &s;till &s;uperior to his own.</P>
<P>"I know not what pa&s;&s;ed at this in&s;tant in my mind; I certainly did not &s;u&s;pect the Count; no, I did not; and yet could I no way account for this his unexpected arrival at the farm. I had, at fir&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed that, ha|ving been home and not finding me in my chamber, he
<PB N="92" REF="034126_0091_0FFA5777C05C7FB0">
had mi&s;tru&s;ted where I was gone; but the &s;urpri&s;e he di&s;covered had wholly eradicated that idea.</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid he, recovering him&s;elf, "it was not you I came to &s;eek; I wanted to &s;peak to Jo&s;&s;elin; I will tell you on what &s;ubject." Then taking me by the arm, he brought me away before I could again &s;ee Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as we were out of the hou&s;e, he told me his &s;erjeant was recruiting at the neighbouring village, that he had ju&s;t been &s;peaking to him, and finding he had enli&s;ted &s;everal young men, with whom he &s;uppo&s;ed Jo&s;&s;elin to be acquainted, he had come to make enqui|ries concerning them. This appeared plau&s;ible, and half di&s;&s;ipated the vague kind of inquietude, I had invo|luntary felt.</P>
<P>"And now," &s;aid the Count, "permit me to a&s;k you, in your turn, what you were doing there; and what &s;aying, to Loui&s;a, in an attitude of &s;uch &s;upplication, and a tone &s;o vehement? Forgive me, Lindorf, but you have granted me your confidence, and of this confidence I &s;hould be mo&s;t unworthy if I did not endeavour to protect you from the wor&s;t of dangers. You promi&s;ed me to remain a week without &s;eeing Loui&s;a; what then could be the intention of this &s;ecret vi&s;it?"</P>
<P>"To convince my&s;elf that I am beloved, and in that ca&s;e"</P>
<P>"Well! what then?"</P>
<P>"Why, then,&mdash;to &s;acrifice every thing to Loui&s;a; to renounce all for her; family, country, fortune, friends: &s;he to me would be all, with her would I fly to the end of the world, if &s;o it were nece&s;&s;ary. I have offered her the choice of a &s;ecret marriage or an elopement; and I am determined on the one or the other. I a&s;k not the Count of Wal&s;tein to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in this enterpri&s;e, but I depend upon his di&s;cretion."</P>
<P>"And has Loui&s;a con&s;ented?" &s;aid he, with emotion.</P>
<P>"She has not an&s;wered me; you &s;uddenly, came in; but &s;he was greatly affected; her tears, her manner, every thing &s;poke her tenderne&s;s; be&s;ide, I am very certain I am beloved."</P>
<P>"It is po&s;&s;ible you may deceive your&s;elf," &s;aid the Count. "I think I am more certain that Loui&s;a loves another."</P>
<P>"Loves another!" repeated I with phren&s;y&mdash;"But, no, it cannot be; Loui&s;a is all innocence; &s;he never is from home, &s;he &s;ees only her father, brother, and me."</P>
<P>"And one more," replied the Count, a young pea&s;ant,
<PB N="93" REF="034126_0092_0FFA585FAAEA5400">
called Ju&s;tin, as I believe; nay, I am a&s;&s;ured he and Loui&s;a have been lovers the&s;e three years, and that Jo&s;|&s;elin has refu&s;ed his con&s;ent to the marriage only becau&s;e Ju&s;tin is poor. If, however, he be beloved"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Unable any longer to li&s;ten, my blood boiling in my veins, and jealou&s;y maddening in my eyes, I &s;eized the Count by the arm, looked &s;teadily at him, with wild di&s;|traction, and demanded from whom he had his informa|tion&mdash;My countenance was &s;o frantic, to which my voice was &s;o corre&s;pondent, that Wal&s;tein was alarmed.</P>
<P>"In the name of Heaven! Lindorf," &s;aid he, taking me by the hand, "be calm; dear Lindorf, recover your|&s;elf; I may have been mi&s;informed or deceived; I will inquire, however, and particularly; that I promi&s;e; ere long I will let you know from whom I received my in|formation, and whether it be or be not exact. But, in|deed, Lindorf," added he, in a tone of the deepe&s;t afflic|tion, "you rend my very heart; there is nothing I would not do, or &s;uffer, to re&s;tore you to your&s;elf and happi|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Happine&s;s!" &s;aid I, in a low voice; happine&s;s exi&s;ts not without Loui&s;a."</P>
<P>"The friend&s;hip, however, of the Count, and his af|fecting and tender manner made me &s;omewhat more com|po&s;ed. I fancied he had been ill informed; I knew this Ju&s;tin, and never had had the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of him; he was a poor orphan, who&s;e &s;ole advantage &s;eemed to be a good per&s;on hid under a dre&s;s &s;o mean that it was an atte&s;tation of his extreme poverty. Educated by charity in the pari&s;h, he had been made &s;hepherd to the village. I had often heard &s;peak of the activity, hone&s;ty, zeal, and even courage with which he did the duties of his place; the flocks all pro&s;pered under his care, and he knew how to cure mo&s;t of their di&s;ea&s;es; he could de|fend them, likewi&s;e, and had, already, killed &s;everal wolves which came to attack them. The country peo|ple vaunted of his talents. He worked prettily in o&s;ier, and carved with his knife, for he had no other tool; his voice was fine, and he played exceedingly well on the flageolet, untaught, except by nature, and perhaps love. I had often, while out a-&s;hooting, &s;topped to li&s;ten to him; but never had it entered my imagination that the poor &s;hepherd, Ju&s;tin, could be my rival. Loui&s;a had appeared to me &s;o very much above him; though, indeed,
<PB N="94" REF="034126_0093_0FFA57855BC69C68">
to me, &s;he had appeared above the whole world. Yet, led now to reflect on the&s;e circum&s;tances, I could not help remembering their birth was equal, and a trifling dif|ference of wealth the only di&s;tinction. Ju&s;tin, too, was a hand&s;ome lad, and I well recollected that, in my con|tinual vi&s;its at the farm, I had often met Ju&s;tin and his flock in the vicinity; but he was always with them, and never had I &s;een him at the farm; nay, I had often &s;poken of his &s;ongs and flageolet to Loui&s;a and her father, but they always had appeared not to pay the lea&s;t attention.</P>
<P>"Thus by turns, tortured and relieved, I knew not what to think; though a rival like Ju&s;tin was too humi|liating not to make me endeavour to doubt. No &s;ooner was I alone than I called for Fritz, who, intimate with his &s;i&s;ter, and very often at his father's, ought to know &s;ome|thing of this affair. I interrogated him, very &s;eriou&s;ly, concerning Ju&s;tin, his intercour&s;e with Loui&s;a, their pretended love for each other, and the &s;ecrecy with which it had been kept from me.</P>
<P>"At fir&s;t, he appeared greatly confu&s;ed; but after|wards, denied every thing; &s;poke of poor Ju&s;tin with the utmo&s;t contempt, a&s;&s;ured me his &s;i&s;ter thought like him, and would be exceedingly offended at &s;uch re|ports; and concluded by a&s;king me from whom I could hear &s;uch a fal&s;ehood. I had the imprudence to name the Count!</P>
<P>"My Lord, the Count," an&s;wered Fritz, &s;haking his head, "knows very well what he is about; he takes care not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell you it is he him&s;elf who loves Loui&s;a; and that this very morning&mdash;but one mu&s;t not tell all one knows."</P>
<P>"He pretended to be going to leave the room; but I commanded him to &s;tay, and, after pre&s;&s;ing him repea|tedly, he told me that, ever &s;ince the fir&s;t day I had brought the Count to the farm, he had become pa&s;&s;ion|ately in love with Loui&s;a; that, while I kept my cham|ber, not a &s;ingle day had pa&s;&s;ed on which the Count had not come to the farm, and endeavoured to &s;educe her by the mo&s;t flattering and advantageous offers; nay, that very morning, that he, Fritz, had caught him with her, and that the Count had tried to bribe him to &s;ecrecy. "Perhaps," added Fritz, "I &s;hould have &s;aid nothing, becau&s;e, to be &s;ure, I don't like to vex my Lord: but &s;ince I &s;ee he wi&s;hes to &s;candalize my &s;i&s;ter, by pretend|ing to talk of her loving a beggar, like Ju&s;tin, I can no
<PB N="95" REF="034126_0094_0FFA586826C0BEF0">
longer hold my tongue. To be &s;ure, I would wi&s;h to con&s;ult my Lord thereupon; for, though I know Loui&s;a is a very virtuous body, and that &s;he loves my Lord too much to love any body el&s;e, yet who can an&s;wer for the&s;e young girls? My Lord the Count is &s;o rich and &s;o pre&s;|&s;ing; and, be&s;ides, he is his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn ma&s;ter; he has neither father nor mother, and the&s;e are plaguy great tempta|tions. Then, if he &s;hould go about to run off with her, for he loves her &s;o de&s;perately that he would do any thing to get her, would it not be better for us to be beforehand with him? If my Lord plea&s;es, we will put her out of his reach in a twinkling; for my part, I have always &s;aid, and always &s;hall &s;ay, I would rather my Lord had her than any body el&s;e."</P>
<P>"My agitation while Fritz was &s;peaking was exce&s;|&s;ive; I walked, or rather &s;trode, about my chamber, not knowing what to think of the Count; my e&s;teem for him was &s;o rooted, that I could not per&s;uade my&s;elf he might be guilty of &s;uch perfidy. Were what I heard true, his per&s;ua&s;ive, his affecting, his powerful eloquence, which &s;eemed the effu&s;ion of the pure&s;t friend&s;hip, would have been nothing more than deceitful artifice to remove me from Loui&s;a, and &s;natch from me this object of my adoration. I could not &s;upport the horrible idea; it ap|peared wholly incompatible with the known character of the Count, and, &s;ternly looking at Fritz, I commanded him to leave my pre&s;ence, and no longer in&s;ult my friend by fal&s;ehoods totally unde&s;erving belief.</P>
<P>"I did more, I intended to go to Wal&s;tein, and un|di&s;gui&s;edly inform him of what I had heard; certain that a &s;ingle word from him would pre&s;ently efface every re|maining trait of &s;u&s;picion. I went; but I found my father with him, who did not leave us the whole even|ing, and before whom &s;uch a conver&s;ation was impo&s;&s;ible. Theirs turned on the duties of &s;ociety, morality, and true honor. The Count &s;aid many things, on the&s;e &s;ubjects, &s;o &s;trong, with &s;uch natural conviction, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with &s;uch a noble energy of mind, and &s;uch a purity of heart, that I inwardly blu&s;hed for having a moment doubt|ed of his virtue, and promi&s;ed my&s;elf never to doubt more. I re&s;olved, likewi&s;e, not to &s;peak to him on the &s;ubject; for to &s;u&s;pect a man lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him of &s;uch an action, I was convinced, was equally fooli&s;h and di&s;graceful. Be&s;ide, to have mentioned it I mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
<PB N="96" REF="034126_0095_0FFA57987B467FE0">
have made my footman his accu&s;er, which was too de|grading; I was, therefore, determined to be &s;ilent my|&s;elf, and to make Fritz &s;ilent al&s;o, whom a fal&s;e zeal for my &s;ervice might have deceived.</P>
<P>"But, while repelling from my memory all his accu|&s;ations again&s;t the Count, I &s;till was re&s;olved to profit by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in carrying off his &s;i&s;ter. I admired the principles of Wal&s;tein, without the power of imitating them; or, rather, I wilfully &s;hut my eyes on the con&s;e|quences of the act. I imagined my benefactions would con&s;ole the aged Jo&s;&s;elin. Madman, that I was! as if gold could con&s;ole a father for the lo&s;s of his child; and a child, too, like Loui&s;a. But I was incapable of rea&s;on. Fatal and terrible effect of the pa&s;&s;ions, how much are they to be feared, &s;ince they can lead a naturally upright and virtuous heart thus dreadfully a&s;tray!</P>
<P>"Wal&s;tein came the next morning to my chamber be|fore I was up; he was dre&s;&s;ed and booted. "Lindorf," &s;aid he, "I am going to the village to meet my &s;erjeant and examine my recruits. I do not a&s;k you to go with me, becau&s;e I intend to call at the farm. I want to &s;peak with Jo&s;&s;elin. After your &s;cene of ye&s;terday, I &s;uppo&s;e both you and Loui&s;a would be eq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ally embarra&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of a third per&s;on; and I inform you that I am going," added he, &s;miling, "in order that, &s;hould you once more e&s;cape from your&s;elf, you may not be once more &s;urpri&s;ed." After affectionately pre&s;&s;ing my hand, he left me.</P>
<P>"This vi&s;it to the farm, of which he &s;poke &s;o open|ly, ought rather to have removed than confirmed my fears. He could not know what Fritz had been &s;aying to me; therefore, there could be no in&s;idious my&s;tery; and yet I was very unea&s;y; tormented by &s;u&s;picions of I know not what; &s;u&s;picions which, notwith&s;tanding, I could not wholly &s;ubdue. I rang my bell, Fritz was not to be found, but one of my father's &s;ervants came i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his &s;tead; he was a native of the village, where he went every day, and I a&s;ked him, with all the indifference I could a&s;&s;ume, whether the &s;erjeant of Wal&s;tein was there, recruiting. He an&s;wered in the affirmative, and more|over, that one of his own brothers was enli&s;ted; as, like|wi&s;e was that Ju&s;tin, who the Count had pretended was the favoured lover of Loui&s;a. "My Lord the Count,"
<PB N="97" REF="034126_0096_0FFA1B99E51D7700">
&s;aid he, "is &s;o good a nobleman, and &s;o kind an officer, that all the young men wi&s;h to &s;erve under him."</P>
<P>"This &s;imple panegvric made me blu&s;h at my own doubts; tranquil, therefore, re&s;pecting the Count and this Ju&s;tin, I thought of nothing but carrying off Loui&s;a, and living and dying for her. This idea was for ever fermenting in my head and my heart; and, at twenty, when devoured by a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o unconquerable, youth is not apt at imagining rea&s;ons which &s;hould counteract it, nor at fore&s;eeing difficulties; &s;econded by Fritz, all things appeared po&s;&s;ible, and I waited for him with im|patience, that we might hold con&s;ultation together.&mdash; Fritz, however, came not, and the Count returned.&mdash; Wholly occupied by my own projects, and held in re|&s;traint by his pre&s;ence, he ob&s;erved the difference of my manner, and very unaffectedly told me &s;o. I &s;aw he wi&s;hed to penetrate my thoughts, and, unwilling to de|ceive him more than nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;poke as little as po&s;&s;ible, yet enough to let him under&s;tand I per&s;i&s;ted in the de&s;ign I had mentioned the evening before.</P>
<P>"After dinner, he left me, as he &s;aid, to go to his apartment and write &s;ome letters; and, after they were fini&s;hed, we were to ride out together. Anxious to take advantage of the moment, the only one, perhaps, I &s;hould have to my&s;elf, I would have in&s;tantly flown to Loui&s;a to have obtained her &s;o much de&s;ired con&s;ent to go off with me; but I might find her father with her, and my going would have been fruitle&s;s. A letter, therefore, which I could privately convey to her, would remove this inconvenience, and I immediately &s;at down to write. The di&s;order of my mind was vi&s;ible in every line. My propo&s;itions of flight were renewed; eternal love was avowed; promi&s;es of compliance to all her wi&s;hes repeat|ed and &s;worn to with all the exaggerations of pa&s;&s;ion. I reque&s;ted an an&s;wer, and referred her to her brother for our mutual arrangement.</P>
<P>"I had folded up my letter&punc; and was got to the door, when Fritz, whom I had not &s;een all day, entered my chamber, ha&s;tily. You, ye&s;terday, Sir," &s;aid he, "treat|ed me as an impo&s;tor. Where do you &s;uppo&s;e my Lord the Count this moment is?"</P>
<P>"My blood in&s;tantly ran cold&mdash;"In his own chamber," an&s;wered I. "Why that que&s;tion?"</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="034126_0097_0FFA5792088DAAB0">"Not in his own chamber, but in my &s;i&s;ter's, where I ju&s;t have &s;een him with my own eyes."</P>
<P>"Take care what you &s;ay&mdash;Wal&s;tein!&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"You may convince your&s;elf, Sir; only go, and you will find him, either there or in the garden, waiting for Loui&s;a, for &s;he was not at home, nor my father either. The Count &s;ent a boy to &s;eek Loui&s;a, in&s;tantly; I heard him, he did not &s;ee me, and came, immediately, to tell you Sir, that you may be convinced I am no lyar."</P>
<P>"As Fritz proceeded, my rage increa&s;ed, till it was &s;oon ungovernable. To be impo&s;ed upon with &s;o much perfidy and ba&s;ene&s;s!&mdash;And by whom? By the man I venerated, the man in the world I mo&s;t re&s;pected, and the friend to whom I had confided the &s;ecrets of my &s;oul!&mdash;I &s;ent Fritz away, and, almo&s;t mechanically, &s;eiz|ed my pi&s;tols, loaded them with ball without perceiving they were loaded before, and, putting them in my pocket, went out with a fury that approached madne&s;s, and was pre&s;ently within &s;ight of the farm.</P>
<P>"It was nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s by the far end of the garden, where, the hedge being low, I &s;aw the Count, impatient|ly walking, and ince&s;&s;antly looking towards the garden door, which was oppo&s;ite to where I &s;topped. Before I had time to determine how it was proper for me to act, the garden door opened, and Loui&s;a, the timid, the mo|de&s;t Loui&s;a, from whom I never could obtain the &s;malle&s;t favour, ran, with open arms to the Count. who opened his to receive her, ki&s;&s;ed his hands, pre&s;&s;ed them between hers, and on him fixed her fine eyes, &s;parkling with love and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"I &s;carcely know how I recovered, for I felt as if I had received the &s;troke of death. A cold, a mortal cold, froze up my blood; my &s;trength abandoned me, and I was obliged to &s;upport my&s;elf by leaning again&s;t a tree. Rage pre&s;ently again brought me to life; again my eyes were ca&s;t towards the fatal garden; the lovers, for I no longer doubted they were &s;o, were expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves with all the warmth of &s;en&s;ibility; the countenance of Wal|&s;tein &s;hone, as it were, with bli&s;s, and never had I be|held it &s;o illumined. I could not hear their di&s;cour&s;e, but, by their ge&s;tures, it &s;eemed as if he ardently entreat|ed &s;omething which Loui&s;a feebly refu&s;ed. At la&s;t, the Count took out a pur&s;e, which appeared full of gold,
<PB N="99" REF="034126_0098_0FFA587CD2ECF0B0">
pre&s;ented it, which, after another moment's he&s;itation, Loui&s;a received with a half confu&s;ed half tender air.</P>
<P>"The Count ki&s;&s;ed her, and both together re-entered the hou&s;e, ju&s;t at the very moment I was going to leap the hedge, and perhaps immolate two victims to revenge. I was no longer ma&s;ter of my actions, and &s;hould certainly have taken away my own life, if I had not immediately &s;een the Count leave the farm, with all the tranquillity of innocence and virtue, which I interpreted into the tri|umph of &s;ucce&s;sful love.</P>
<P>"Defend thy&s;elf," &s;aid I, "traitor," running up to him with my pi&s;tols; pre&s;enting him the handle of one and the muzzle of the other to his heart; "Deprive me of the life which thou ha&s;t rendered mi&s;erable, or let me rid the world of a perfidious mon&s;ter!"</P>
<P>"He would have laid hold of my arm, and have &s;po|ken to me. "I will hear nothing," &s;aid I, "defend your&s;elf! I am capable of any mi&s;chief!"</P>
<P>"So &s;aying, I clapped the mouth of my pi&s;tol to my own forehead. Happy, mo&s;t happy, had I been had I drawn the trigger! But the Count prevented me, and, taking the pi&s;tol&mdash;"You are determined," &s;aid he; then, drawing back a few paces, fired it in the air. Mine was di&s;charged at the &s;ame moment; but mine (for ever cur&s;ed be that moment!) took a fatal, an abhorred direction. I &s;aw my friend &s;tagger, and fall, bathed in his own blood, and &s;aying, "Alas! poor Lindorf! when you &s;hall know&mdash;Ah! how much more will you be to be pi|tied than I!"</P>
<P>"All my rage in&s;tantly vani&s;hed. I ca&s;t the murder|ous pi&s;tol from me; and, running up to my friend, en|deavoured, with my handkerchief, to &s;top the blood that bubbled from the wound. One ball had &s;truck him on the face, and, he &s;aid, he thought he felt a wound in the knee, but was convinced that neither of them was mortal. I dragged him to the tree, and placed him a|gain&s;t it, where I gave him all the &s;uccour in my power; for I was &s;o totally be&s;ide my&s;elf that I had even forgot the farm, which was not forty paces di&s;tant. I remem|bered not &s;o much as the cau&s;e of this mi&s;erable affair; at that moment of horror the danger of Wal&s;tein was all I remembered: I kneeled behind him; he leaned again&s;t my brea&s;t, and, notwith&s;tanding the univer&s;al tremor of
<PB N="100" REF="034126_0099_0FFA917D2DE918F8">
my limbs, I bound up his wound with our two hand|kerchiefs.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had I fini&s;hed, than recollection &s;uddenly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d.

My groans could not find ut|terance. I hid my face in the du&s;t, and added nothing but inarticulate cries and exclamations.</P>
<P>"Lindorf," &s;aid the poor wounded Wal&s;tein, "Dear Lindorf, be calm, li&s;ten to me. There is one way, &s;till, of repairing your wrongs, of pre&s;erving, nay, even of augmenting my friend&s;hip. Yes, dearer to me &s;hall you be than ever, if you will pledge your honour to perform what I am going to reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"I had no doubt but it was to renounce Loui&s;a; but the atrocious crime I had committed had wrought &s;o in&s;tant a revolution in my feelings that I did not he&s;itate a moment to promi&s;e, by the mo&s;t &s;acred oaths, to per|form all he &s;hould require.</P>
<P>"Well, then," &s;aid the mo&s;t generous of men, "I require, ab&s;olutely, without re&s;erve, that this affair, for|ever, remain a &s;ecret between you and me; happily, no one has &s;een us; let me tell the &s;tory my own way; and beware, Lindorf, how thou contradicte&s;t me. Thou ha&s;t &s;worn, and I repeat, on this condition, only, can I pardon and love thee &s;till. A &s;ole word will for ever deprive thee of my friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>"I would have &s;poken, but &s;obs and groans prevent|ed me. I could only take his hand and pre&s;s it to my heart, which was rent by the mo&s;t cruel remor&s;e. In de&s;pite of all my cares the wound continued to bleed; Wal&s;tein, with my aid, endeavoured to ri&s;e, but he &s;oon perceived the wound in his knee was much wor&s;e than he had &s;uppo&s;ed. One of the balls had taken a different direction, and, we feared, the knee-pan was wounded, for he could not bear the lea&s;t weight on it, but again &s;unk down on the ground.</P>
<P>"I dete&s;ted, I cur&s;ed, I prayed, I almo&s;t &s;hrieked with agony, I pro&s;trated my&s;elf at the feet of my friend, while he continued to yield me every con&s;olation.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t &s;aid he, "Go to the farm, and endeavour to get a&s;&s;i&s;tance; you will there find a proof that I was not, as you have &s;uppo&s;ed, the ba&s;e&s;t of men. Go, but remem|ber your oath; if you break it, I never will &s;ee you more."</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="034126_0100_0FFA913565EEA9B0">"I could not reply, but ran to the farm, and, as I precipitately entered, immediately beheld in explanation of the conduct of Wal&s;tein, and irrefragable rea&s;ons for holding my own in &s;till more utter, more damnable ab|horrence! O! pardon&mdash;Mine was the guilt of fiends! The &s;hepherd, Ju&s;tin, new clothed, was &s;eated be&s;ide Loui&s;a, holding one of her hands between his, while &s;he was leaning on his &s;houlder, and looking up at him with every &s;peaking &s;en&s;ation that tenderne&s;s and happine&s;s could in&s;pire. The old man, Jo&s;&s;elin, &s;at oppo&s;ite to them, contemplating a &s;cene &s;o affecting to the heart, and holding the pur&s;e the Count had given Loui&s;a, and which I had &s;uppo&s;ed the price of her di&s;honour, On the table was another, equally large. Every circum&s;tance was a dagger to my heart, and, in&s;en&s;ate as I had been, devoured by pa&s;&s;ion, I can &s;olemnly atte&s;t that remor&s;e, bitter, inexpre&s;&s;ible, and almo&s;t intolerable, was the only feeling of which I was con&s;cious, or capable.</P>
<P>"Oh! my friends," &s;aid I, as I entered; "come with me, fly to &s;uccour the Count; he is here, ju&s;t by, wounded, come, in&s;tantly." My &s;udden appearance, my palene&s;s, the blood on my clothes, and the intelligence I brought, were each a &s;ubject of terror.&mdash;"Good God!" exclaimed Loui&s;a and Ju&s;tin, "our dear benefactor wounded!"</P>
<P>"I led them to the place where I had left the Count. Pain, and the lo&s;s of blood, had &s;o enfeebled him that he was almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible. Loui&s;a ran for water, and vine|gar. He came a little to him&s;elf, and, with difficulty, related that a pi&s;tol, with which he had been amu&s;ing him&s;elf, having bur&s;t as he fired it, had occa&s;ioned all this di&s;a&s;ter, and that my coming by was the effect of chance.</P>
<P>"It was nece&s;&s;ary to bear him to the Chateau, and Ju&s;tin &s;lew to the farm, and brought back a kind of hur|dle, and a mattre&s;s, on which he was laid. Ju&s;tin, in the prime of youth, and animated by gratitude, not, like me, weighed down by guilt, was mo&s;t u&s;eful and active. Loui&s;a and her aged father gave us all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power, and we began our march. It was long, and mo&s;t painful; and, as we proceeded, &s;everal things that Ju&s;tin and Loui&s;a &s;aid to each other gave me to under|&s;tand they had long been lovers, and that the Count, that
<PB N="102" REF="034126_0101_0FFA9180E20F7F68">
very day, had removed every ob&s;tacle to their union, by giving Ju&s;tin a con&s;iderable farm, at his e&s;tate of Wal|&s;tein&punc; under the &s;ole condition that they &s;hould marry, immediately depart, and that Jo&s;&s;elin &s;hould go with them.</P>
<P>"Criminal, indeed, mo&s;t criminal, did this relation make me; but my pa&s;&s;ion for Loui&s;a was &s;o perfectly cur|ed by this dreadful event, that I heard, even with a kind of horrid plea&s;ure, &s;he was to be gone, and that I &s;hould &s;ee her no more!</P>
<P>"We arrived, at length, at the Chateau; and the hurdle being placed in the hall, and &s;ervants called to a&s;&s;i&s;t, my fir&s;t care was to take a hor&s;e, and ride, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, to the next town in &s;earch of &s;urgeons. It was more than three leagues di&s;tant. I made, how|ever, &s;o much ha&s;te that I returned with them by du&s;k. I found every per&s;on in the mo&s;t fearful con&s;ternation. The manner in which my father received me, tenderly embracing me, melting in tears, and prai&s;ing my zeal, proved that he was totally ignorant of the part I had had in this dreadful affair. His de&s;pair was &s;uch that, had he known it, he certainly could not have &s;urvived &s;uch tenfold addition of mi&s;ery. The recollection of this, more than my oath, kept me &s;ilent; but I may truly &s;ay the &s;ilence was a burthen to my heart, and that nothing could &s;o effectually have given it ea&s;e as to have proclaim|ed my guilt, and thus have rendered me as dete&s;table to the whole world as I was to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"The &s;urgeon, after the operation of extracting the balls, and probing the wounds of Wal&s;tein, declared they were not mortal, but that, it was to be feared, he would lo&s;e one eye, and the u&s;e of his leg; and they even &s;poke of amputation. The Count, who &s;omewhat doubted of their &s;kill, re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed this, and &s;u&s;tained, with fortitude, almo&s;t incredible, the dre&s;&s;ing of the wounds, and the afflicting intelligence they had communicated. I could not &s;upport being pre&s;ent; but, when the &s;ur|geons had done, I again entered his chamber, and &s;olemn|ly &s;wore never to quit it but in company with Wal&s;tein. I know not how it happened that my exce&s;&s;ive grief did not betray our &s;ecret. It was, indeed, mo&s;t profound. My tears flowed continually; while the &s;uffering victim of my hateful crime uncea&s;ingly endeavoured to calm and comfort me. He &s;aid, and prote&s;ted, that he looked on the event as fortunate; that his inclination and abili|ties
<PB N="103" REF="034126_0102_0FFA9138130D1340">
had always rather led him to &s;tudy than to a military life; that he had devoted him&s;elf to the latter, in obedi|ence to his father and his king; and that he &s;hould be exceedingly glad of &s;o fair a pretext to for&s;ake it, and yield to his love of literature and political and legi&s;lative re&s;earches. "Be&s;ide," added he, "you are now cured of your pa&s;&s;ion; the remedy, it is true, has been &s;omewhat violent, but it has had its effect, and I mo&s;t unfeignedly return Heaven thanks for all that has pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>"Yes, it had had its effects; but I &s;hould ill de&s;erve the &s;ublime friend&s;hip of Wal&s;tein if I did not lament and execrate them everla&s;tingly. I was cured of my love; for, three weeks after this misfortune had happen|ed, I heard, without the lea&s;t emotion, unle&s;s it were an emotion of joy from the mouth of Ju&s;tin, who came every day to enquire concerning the health of his benefactor, that he had married Loui&s;a, and that they were ready to depart for their new habitation.</P>
<P>"The Count now entered circum&s;tantially on that &s;ubject; delicacy had, hitherto, kept him &s;ilent; but, &s;o|licited by me, he informed me that the morrow after the vi&s;it we had together paid at the farm, alarmed by the violence of my pa&s;&s;ion, he mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly reflected on the means of avoiding effects &s;o fatal; that his &s;erjeant brought him a young man whom he had ju&s;t enli&s;ted; this was the poor Ju&s;tin; his hand&s;ome per&s;on, intelligent coun|tenance, and profound melancholy, gained the attention of the Count, and he que&s;tioned him concerning what induced him to enli&s;t. The &s;incere and &s;imple Ju&s;tin did not endeavour to di&s;gui&s;e his motives. Pa&s;&s;ionately enamoured of Loui&s;a, her lover for &s;everal years, but without the lea&s;t ray of hope, rejected by Jo&s;&s;elin, mena|ced by Fritz, he wi&s;hed only to die; but he wi&s;hed to die like a brave fellow, combating the enemies of his King, I &s;hould die all the &s;ame," &s;aid he, "with grief at &s;eeing Loui&s;a the wife of another; and this misfortune mu&s;t be mine, for her father has &s;worn I &s;hall never be her hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"The Count a&s;ked him if he were beloved by Loui&s;a. "To be &s;ure, I certainly am," an&s;wered he; "if I were not, I might not, perhaps, have been true to her for &s;o long a time. But, poor dear Loui&s;a! I ye&s;terday &s;aw her never to &s;ee her again, and we both wept &s;o much at parting that we thought we &s;hould have died with grief."</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="034126_0103_0FFA91838BD76710">"I recollect, dear Lindorf," &s;aid the Count, "that when you fir&s;t took me to &s;ee Loui&s;a her melancholy &s;truck us both."</P>
<P>"But, I hope," continued Ju&s;tin, "that, when I am gone, Loui&s;a will be le&s;s unhappy&punc; her father, and her brother in particular, ill treat her every day on my ac|count; and that is the rea&s;on why I am determined to become a &s;oldier. I wi&s;h, indeed indeed I do, &s;he may forget me; but her I &s;hall never forget; no never never to my dying day."</P>
<P>"Wal&s;tein was extremely affected by the &s;incerity; hone&s;t intentions, and pa&s;&s;ion of Ju&s;tin; and in&s;tantly conceived the project of rendering two lovers happy, and re&s;cuing me from the wor&s;t of dangers. He mentioned nothing of his intentions to Ju&s;tin, being fir&s;t de&s;irous to &s;peak to Loui&s;a and know if he had told him the exact truth. He went twice to the farm before he could find her alone, but watched his opportunity &s;o well that at la&s;t he &s;poke to her in private. He had little difficulty in bringing her to confe&s;s her love for Ju&s;tin; her heart was full of nothing el&s;e; and &s;he had done nothing but weep &s;ince he had enli&s;ted. She was de&s;irous of recom|mending him to the Count; and, therefore, glad of find|ing him alone, &s;he told him their love had commenced long before the death of her mother; that ever &s;ince &s;he bad each day gone to meet him at the pa&s;turage, and Ju&s;|tin had taught him&s;elf to play on the flageolet, purpo&s;ely that he might not only give her the &s;ignal to come and join him, but accompany her likewi&s;e when &s;he &s;ung. To gain her favour, al&s;o, he had learned to make ba&s;ket-work, &s;pinning-wheels, bobbins, to twine the o&s;ier, and to carve in wood. Loui&s;a &s;hewed the Count two little groups of his &s;culpture exceedingly well carved, the one repre&s;enting Loui&s;a and the other Ju&s;tin him&s;elf &s;eated at her feet; both the figures were &s;ufficiently like to be known. In another carving, &s;till better executed, the young &s;hepherd was combating a large wolf; for it was for the &s;ake of Loui&s;a, al&s;o, that he had fir&s;t given proofs of his courage&punc; by killing the wolf which was bearing off one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en of Jo&s;&s;elin.</P>
<P>"How might the tender and grateful Loui&s;a refu&s;e yielding her heart to him who &s;o well had merited the gift! "Yes, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he to the Count, with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of legibility, "I love him with my whole

&s;oul, and &s;hall for ever love him, though I never &s;hould &s;ee him more.&mdash;One hope, alas, we had, one &s;ole hope. I often &s;aid to Ju&s;tin, when he bewailed his poverty, "Be comforted, dear Ju&s;tin, only wait till our young ma&s;ter returns, he will &s;peak for us to his father, and, I am well per&s;uaded, will have us married. Our young ma&s;ter is returned, but"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a &s;topped&mdash;"Fini&s;h what you had to &s;ay," &s;aid the Count.&mdash;"I very well perceive," &s;aid &s;he, blu&s;h|ing and looking down, "I was wrong; and I &s;hould even be very &s;orry, at pre&s;ent, if he knew I loved Ju&s;tin: for my brother has a&s;&s;ured me he would kill him, imme|diately. When Ju&s;tin is out of his reach, I then will tell him, the fir&s;t time I &s;ee him; and if he wi&s;hes to kill one of us, let it be me."</P>
<P>"Wal&s;tein comforted Loui&s;a, promi&s;ed her &s;he &s;hould &s;oon be happy, that Ju&s;tin belonged to him, at pre&s;ent; he might di&s;po&s;e of him, and he would make him the hu&s;band of Loui&s;a. Scarcely could &s;he believe what &s;he heard, and the very hope appeared but like a dream. Wal&s;tein, however, a&s;&s;ured her it &s;hould be realized im|mediately, for that he had &s;poken to Ju&s;tin, and that he would directly &s;peak to Jo&s;&s;elin.</P>
<P>"It was that very day, dear Lindorf," continued the Count, "when, after having arranged every thing with the young &s;hepherd, after having enjoyed the pure&s;t of plea&s;ures, and &s;poken to Jo&s;&s;elin concerning the marriage of his children, that I found you kneeling to Loui&s;a. The poor girl, con&s;cious of what I had been doing, and who was waiting for me with all the impatience of love, was exceedingly a&s;hamed of being &s;urpri&s;ed with you in that manner. I confe&s;s, I al&s;o was di&s;concerted, in&s;o|much that I &s;carcely could conceal my feelings; which, perhaps, fir&s;t gave ri&s;e to your &s;u&s;picions&punc; I my&s;elf was not free from them; I was fearful le&s;t Loui&s;a had decei|ved both Ju&s;tin and me; le&s;t you and &s;he under&s;tood each other; and, anxious to know the truth, que&s;tioned you. Your an&s;wer was but half &s;atisfactory; it, how|ever, convinced me of the great danger you were in, and that, at all events, it was nece&s;&s;ary to tear from you the object of that pa&s;&s;ion to which you were ready to &s;acri|fice every moral duty. You may remember, Lindorf, I in part informed you of the love of Ju&s;tin for Loui&s;a; imagining that, perhaps, your pa&s;&s;ion would decrea&s;e if
<PB N="106" REF="034126_0105_0FFA91864FFCA2D8">
you knew the love of Loui&s;a was divided. Had you re|ceived this intelligence with more moderation, I then &s;hould have told you all; but your phren&s;y was too vi&s;i|ble. Rea&s;on had lo&s;t every hold over your mind, and your actions had &s;omewhat convul&s;ive about them that made me &s;hudder. I &s;aw this was not the proper oppor|tunity to proceed further. I had &s;aid too much, and all I had to do was to &s;mother the fire I had kindled.</P>
<P>"I, therefore, endeavoured to calm your mind, bring you to your&s;elf, and promi&s;ed to make farther enquiries; hoping, thereby to gain time for Loui&s;a and Ju&s;tin to depart, and thus prevent your ra&s;h project of marriage or elopement. In order to ha&s;ten the wedding, I went the next morning to Jo&s;&s;elin; after having told you where I was going, purpo&s;ely that you might not come and interrupt our conver&s;ation. I was alone with Loui&s;a but a moment, but this was enough to convince me of the wrong I had done her, by &s;u&s;pecting any concerted treachery between her and you. The idea had torment|ed her all night, and her inquietude, grief, and ingenu|ous an&s;wers removed every remaining doubt.</P>
<P>"She left the room as her father entered. I &s;poke fir&s;t of my recruits; and taking out the li&s;t, read over their names. When I came to that of Ju&s;tin, I &s;aw the old man was highly plea&s;ed.&mdash;"Ah!" &s;aid he, "is that knave enli&s;ted? Heaven be prai&s;ed! we &s;hall now be rid of him."</P>
<P>"Knave! what knave, Jo&s;&s;elin?" &s;aid I. "I will have no knaves in my regiment; and I will give him his di&s;charge."</P>
<P>"Oh! do not do &s;o, by any means, my Lord," repli|ed Jo&s;&s;elin. "To be &s;ure, I ought to &s;peak with more re&s;pect before you, and not have called him a knave, for there is not an hone&s;ter lad in the whole village, nor is the King him&s;elf a braver fellow. He will make nothing of killing you a wolf, you may &s;uppo&s;e then what he would do with a man; and you cannot have a better &s;ol|dier; but to tell you the truth," added he, lowering his voice, "he has taken it into his head to fall in love with our Loui&s;a, and the poor little fool, with con&s;ent or without con&s;ent, would fain marry him; a fellow without a &s;hilling, educated by charity; but no, I would rather follow her to the grave. God be prai&s;ed! he mu&s;t now &s;oon leave the country, and I hope we &s;hall never hear
<PB N="107" REF="034126_0106_0FFA913BB4A3D098">
of him more. And yet, it is a pity too; for he took great care of all our flocks; he &s;aved me a fine &s;heep; and the lad wants neither courage nor ingenuity&mdash;if it was not for that devili&s;h love."</P>
<P>"And do you not wi&s;h to marry Loui&s;a, to con&s;ole her for the ab&s;ence of Ju&s;tin?"</P>
<P>"Ah! would to Heaven &s;he was married! Girls are nothing but torment. I no &s;ooner find my&s;elf relieved, on one hand, than I am attacked on the other. Our young Baron is always haunting, now, about the hou&s;e: &s;o long as &s;he had her Ju&s;tin &s;he was well guarded. I did not &s;tand on ceremony with him; but, at pre&s;ent, I do not know what may happen; for I cannot forbid my young ma&s;ter my hou&s;e as I did Ju&s;tin; and, then, one cannot always be at home. I &s;hould be happy if I could but &s;ee her once well &s;ettled, but there is not the lea&s;t appearance of it. The people of our village are all poor, and Loui&s;a is not rich."</P>
<P>"Well, Jo&s;&s;elin, if you con&s;ent, I my&s;elf will mar|ry her to one of my farmers; an hone&s;t young man and above want. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a good gra&s;s farm, on my e&s;|tate at Wal&s;tein; &s;ome days journey from this place; larger, I believe, than this of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ours; and, as I e&s;teem him very much, I will give him a pur&s;e of fifty ducats, on the wedding day, and as much to your daughter, to defray the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tence of the nuptials, and begin hou&s;ekeep|ing. If you think this a proper match, &s;ay &s;o, and it is a bargain."</P>
<P>"Jo&s;&s;elin, all amazement, would have fallen pro&s;trate. "A proper match! my Lord&punc;" &s;aid he: "I cannot for|bear weeping with joy and gratitude. All my fear is le&s;t he &s;hould not fancy Loui&s;a; and if he &s;hould hear of her love for Ju&s;tin"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Fear nothing, he will not be jealous. Ju&s;tin is his friend, and the more Loui&s;a &s;hall love her hu&s;band the happier will Ju&s;tin be."</P>
<P>"The good old Jo&s;&s;elin opened his eyes, &s;taring, as it were, after the meaning of what I had &s;aid. An ex|planation, therefore, was nece&s;&s;ary; and this threw him into &s;till greater a&s;toni&s;hment. But he the more joyfully confirmed his con&s;ent, becau&s;e his daughter, by this means, would be happy.</P>
<P>"The only thing I &s;tipulated for was that they &s;hould immediately depart for my farm; and to this there was
<PB N="108" REF="034126_0107_0FFA9187F1BAC238">
no objection. Jo&s;&s;elin propo&s;ed even to remove him&s;elf, and live with his children. I de&s;ired him to inform Lou|i&s;a of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and left him to go down to the village. I there gave Ju&s;tin his di&s;charge, &s;igned the gift of the farm, and left him the pur&s;e of fifty ducats which I had promi&s;ed. After this I returned to you. Your air and manner, &s;ometimes ab&s;ent, &s;ometimes agi|tated, &s;entences half pronounced, and the di&s;appearance of Fritz, who had been away from the ca&s;tle all night and all day; the&s;e, collectively, made me fear you had con|certed &s;ome project; the execution of which might, per|haps, be more prompt than I &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>"I re&s;olved, therefore, to ha&s;ten the marriage, and the departure of the young people, as much as po&s;&s;ible; and, for this purpo&s;e, I again returned to the farm. This was the only injunction I had to lay on them, for the be|nefits already conferred, and the pur&s;e I intended to pre&s;ent to Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>"What followed, dear Lindorf, I need not relate. You know how much you were deceived by appearances. Loui&s;a had been, all the day, at the village with a relation, in order, mo&s;t likely, to avoid another vi&s;it from you. Her father, impatient to inform her of her happine&s;s, had gone in &s;earch of her. They had met the happy Ju&s;tin, who came along with them; he had &s;hewn them all his trea&s;ure. A boy, whom I had &s;ent in &s;earch of Loui&s;a, told her I was waiting for her; &s;he, unable to repre&s;s the fir&s;t emotions of her joy, ran, out of breath, to te&s;tify her gratitude in the manner by which you were &s;o cruelly deceived.</P>
<P>"Yes, Lindorf, I can imagine my&s;elf in your place, during this terrible moment; can &s;uppo&s;e all the dreadful ideas and &s;en&s;ations by which you were a&s;&s;aulted. Sure|ly, you cannot doubt, then, that I can forgive you. A little more openne&s;s on my part, a little le&s;s pa&s;&s;ion on yours, and this misfortune had never happened; and, let me add, it will be no real misfortune to me &s;o long as you &s;hall remain un&s;u&s;pected of being in any manner an acce&s;&s;ary."</P>
<P>"This recital was made at various times, as his &s;trength permitted, and continually excited in my bo&s;om the mo&s;t painful remor&s;e. I li&s;tened, and, in my turn, informed the Count how entirely that vile fellow Fritz had de|ceived me. I never &s;aw him &s;ince the fatal day on
<PB N="109" REF="034126_0108_0FFA914089DDB220">
which he di&s;appeared from the chateau, and I learned from his father he had li&s;ted for a &s;oldier: &s;ince when I have never heard of him more.</P>
<P>"The day after the&s;e fearful events, my father thought it his duty to go him&s;elf to Berlin and inform the King; and, leaving Wal&s;tein to my care, he undertook this melancholy journey. The King was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affect|ed when he was told, and immediately &s;ent his own &s;ur|geons to Ronebourg, informing my father he would come him&s;elf as &s;oon as Wal&s;tein &s;hould be out of danger.&mdash; The &s;urgeons of Berlin confirmed all the others had &s;aid; except that they hoped the wound of the knee would be le&s;s prejudicial than had been &s;uppo&s;ed, and that the Count might pre&s;erve his leg, though he certainly would become &s;omewhat lame.</P>
<P>"I had a bed brought into his chamber, never leaving him a moment day or night, and ince&s;&s;antly endeavouring, by attention and care, to prove how deeply I repented; Wal&s;tein &s;eemed as &s;en&s;ible of, and as grateful for, the&s;e by attentions, as if I had not been the per&s;on who occa|&s;ioned him to &s;tand in need of them. To amu&s;e and di|vert his mind I read to him, as &s;oon as the &s;urgeons would permit me. Till then, my youth, vivacity, want of thought, and the fatal pa&s;&s;ion I had conceived for Loui&s;a, had prevented my application to &s;tudy. I now learned the charms of this occupation, which communi|cates knowledge, amends the heart, and ornaments the mind. I could ea&s;ily perceive that, in his choice of books, his purpo&s;e was rather my in&s;truction, and a wi&s;h to give n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a ta&s;te for reading, than his own amu&s;ement. When I had ended, he made the mo&s;t ju&s;t and profound reflections on what had been read; which, to me, were &s;o many rays of light. Whenever the &s;ubject happened to be the duties of a &s;old<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, he de&s;cribed them with en|ergy, proved how they were compatible with morality and true honour, and how far courage might be allied to humanity and &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>"Excellent Wal&s;tein! If, at pre&s;ent, I have any vir|tues, to thee am I indebted for them. Thou ha&s;t made me &s;uch as I am, and the two months I lived in thy chamber, after a crime for which any other man would have held me in everla&s;ting abhorrence, and have been appea&s;ed only by my blood, by thy benolence and wi&s;|dom
<PB N="110" REF="034126_0109_0FFA918AA546D8C0">
I gained more knowledge, and was better taught the duties of man, than by all my preceding education."</P>
<P>We have forborne to interrupt a narrative &s;o intere&s;t|ing by any remarks on what the feelings of Caroline were; and our rea&s;on for this forbearance was, that every reader might judge from his own heart, and imagine the pa&s;&s;ages at which the manu&s;cript was laid down or taken up; or where it dropt from the hands of the wife of Wal|&s;tein; tho&s;e at which her heart palpitated more or le&s;s, or where &s;ome &s;trong exclamation was involuntarily ut|tered. It is very certain, however, that &s;he did not read thus far without interruption; and, moreover, that, at this particular place, an emotion, prompt and in&s;tinctive, made her &s;natch up the box. She only half opened it, and &s;hut it again, with a kind of re&s;pectful fear, as if it had been profaned by her looks: after which, laying it clo&s;e to her elbow, &s;he again took up the manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>"A month after the accident, the King, learning that his favourite could ri&s;e, came to Ronebourg, with few attendants. Wal&s;tein, then, pre&s;ented me, for the fir&s;t time; and the King gave me a&s;&s;urances of his good will and future protection. Alas! what was my confu&s;ion, what my &s;hame, when I heard him prai&s;ing me for the proofs of friend&s;hip I had given, on this melancholy oc|ca&s;ion, and the uninterrupted attention I had paid the Count! Had it not been for my father's pre&s;ence and the recollection of the pangs he mu&s;t have &s;uffered, I really believe, I &s;hould have fallen at his feet, have confe&s;&s;ed how little I de&s;erved his eulogiums, and have owned the whole enormity of my guilt.</P>
<P>"The King, after remaining a few moments in the chamber, de&s;ired to be left alone with the Count. They were together for &s;ome time. At la&s;t my father was call|ed in; and, pre&s;ently afterwards, I al&s;o. As I entered, I found my father kneeling to the King, and ki&s;&s;ing his hand. "Come hither my &s;on," &s;aid he; "come and kneel with me, to thank the be&s;t of Monarchs, and the mo&s;t generous of friends.&mdash;The Count has re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion in the guards, and, at his entreaty, his Ma|je&s;ty has graciou&s;ly be&s;towed it on you. Lindorf! my &s;on! if it be po&s;&s;ible, merit this di&s;tinction, by equalling your predece&s;&s;or!"</P>
<P>"To Wal&s;tein I would have kneeled, in his bo&s;om would have hid my confu&s;ion, if I might; and &s;o &s;trong|ly
<PB N="111" REF="034126_0110_0FFA9143327E7F98">
was I affected, that my father, thinking me half di&s;|tracted with my joy, was obliged to recall my attention to the King, who rai&s;ed me with affability, and, like my father, exhorted me to imitate the Count.</P>
<P>"Imitate him!" &s;aid I, approaching him and &s;eizing his hand, which he held out to me. "Is it po&s;&s;ible for man to acquire virtue &s;o &s;ublime? Can I, wretch!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Wal&s;tein looked at me, and immediately put his hand on my mouth.</P>
<P>"Oh, Caroline! &s;uch is the man to whom you are united; &s;uch is he to whom, no doubt, you are proud, at pre&s;ent, to appertain, and whom you are now wi&s;hing to make happy&mdash;And, oh, how exqui&s;ite mu&s;t be his felicity! So exqui&s;ite, that he alone, I confe&s;s, can be worthy of it!</P>
<P>"The King departed, the &s;ame day, for Berlin, and &s;oon after &s;ent me my Captain's commi&s;&s;ion. At length, I found my&s;elf alone with Wal&s;tein. My heart was full, almo&s;t to &s;uffocation, and I wi&s;hed to expre&s;s &s;ome part of what I felt. But no! Expre&s;&s;ions could not be found! Words were too feeble! and I could only te&s;tify my gratitude as to a Deity!</P>
<P>His friend&s;hip for me &s;eemed to increa&s;e every day. "Good young man,"
would he often &s;ay, when he &s;aw me &s;tand with my eyes fixed on his wounds, "do not &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e a misfortune. Believe me, for it is a truth, we both are gainers; and I, e&s;pecially: a friend, &s;uch as thou wilt be, merits well to be purcha&s;ed with the lo&s;s of an eye. Had I a mi&s;tre&s;s," added he, &s;miling, "per|haps I &s;hould be le&s;s a philo&s;opher; yet, &s;uch as I &s;hall be, I do not de&s;pair of finding a woman rational enough to love me. Love has been the cau&s;e of my misfortune, and love ought to make me reparation."</P>
<P>"Behold, how ju&s;t Heaven is, Caroline! Love will make him reparation, and I alone, as I ought, &s;hall be unhappy.&mdash;Yet, no! I ought not, I &s;hall not be, while I am a witne&s;s of the felicity of two per&s;ons &s;o dear to my heart! Oh! that I may but accompli&s;h the ardent wi&s;h I have that the&s;e two per&s;ons, &s;o worthy, &s;hould be fully known to each other!</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as he was &s;ufficiently recovered to travel to Berlin, I joined my regiment, which lay there, and which I found mo&s;t excellently di&s;ciplined. Wal&s;tein, yielding to his inclinations, retired to continual and &s;e|vere
<PB N="112" REF="034126_0111_0FFA918E576E36F8">
&s;tudy; which, added to want of exerci&s;e, was de|trimental to his health. He became meagre, and his in|ce&s;&s;ant application to reading and writing gave him that &s;toop in the &s;houlders which you, no doubt, have ob&s;er|ved; but he had no longer preten&s;ion to beauty, and he was become pa&s;&s;ionately fond of &s;tudy. The laws and policy of nations, which require knowledge &s;o exten&s;ive, were the re&s;earches to which he was mo&s;t addicted. In two or three years he was capable of undertaking the mo&s;t difficult negociations, and of filling, with the greate&s;t dignity and &s;ucce&s;s, the brilliant employment he now holds.</P>
<P>"When we arrived at Berlin, he introduced me to his aunt, the Barone&s;s de Za&s;trow, with whom the young Counte&s;s Matilda, his &s;i&s;ter, had been brought up.&mdash; Long a widow, and without children, the Barone&s;s look|ed upon her niece as her daughter, and &s;ole heire&s;s. The Count, al&s;o, was fond of his young &s;i&s;ter, and was as careful of her education and future happine&s;s as the mo&s;t tender father could have been. He had often &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en of her to me, at Ronebourg, and made it no &s;ecret that he &s;hould behold with plea&s;ure a probability of our union, and thus add another tie to friend&s;hip. I thought her charming, but &s;he was &s;carcely thirteen. She was &s;till but a lively girl with whom I could play with plea&s;ure, but who did not in&s;pire the &s;ame &s;en&s;ations I had felt from the company of Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>"My heart, however, being perfectly free, and the company I found at the Barone&s;s de Za&s;trow's exceeding|ly agreeable, I went there, regularly, every day; where I was received as the intimate friend of Wal&s;tein. Ma|tilda, particularly, took a thou&s;and opportunities of do|ing me little favours. She called me her brother, and told me, laughing, &s;he hardly ever &s;aw her own, &s;ince he was become &s;o ordinary and &s;o learned; therefore, &s;he thought it was my duty to come in his &s;tead. I, in the &s;ame kind of &s;port, called her my dear little &s;i&s;ter, and behaved as if &s;he really had been &s;o. Although &s;he was very hand&s;ome&punc; and daily became more formed, I felt no other &s;entiments for her than tho&s;e of friend&s;hip, or brotherly affection. The kind of beauty &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, however &s;eductive it might be to others, was not, pre|ci&s;ely, that which I &s;hould prefer. It was neither the regular and &s;triking features of Loui&s;a, nor the enchant|ing
<PB N="113" REF="034126_0112_0FFA9144E9AEDA48">
countenance, the look cele&s;tial, which penetrates the hidden &s;entiments of the &s;oul, the lip of innocence, the angelic voice, the&mdash;</P>
<P>"Another word, Caroline, and you mu&s;t never behold this manu&s;cript! Let me &s;peak only of the Count, him only &s;ee, think only of him; let my mind be wholly oc|cupied by that &s;ublime idea, and forget every other.</P>
<P>"Where was I?&mdash;Speaking, I believe, of the young Counte&s;s Matilda. You, I &s;uppo&s;e, have never &s;een her. She was at Dre&s;den when you were at Berlin, where &s;he remains, with Madam de Za&s;trow, who has there fixed her re&s;idence. She no way re&s;embles what her brother was before his misfortune. In&s;tead of his benevolent and dignified pre&s;ence, Matilda's features are delicate and &s;mall; the character of her countenance is that of mirth and vivacity. The &s;ymmetry of her per&s;on is ex|act; her arm is round; her feet exceedingly pretty; her wait &s;mall; her no&s;e turned up; her eyes blue, and intel|ligent; her ro&s;e-coloured lips are always ready to laugh, and add dimples to her cheeks; and her whole form con|veys the idea of what we call &s;ports and &s;miles; but ne|ver any thing of tender &s;entiment. She &s;eems even in|capable of &s;uch &s;en&s;ations; &s;o that one may play with her without the lea&s;t danger either to her or one's &s;elf.</P>
<P>"Yet, however, did &s;he, &s;en&s;ibly, begin to lo&s;e a part of the thoughtle&s;s gaiety by which &s;he &s;eemed to be cha|racterized. She &s;till laughed, but the laugh often &s;eemed forced, and was &s;ometimes followed by a &s;igh. By de|grees &s;he cea&s;ed to call me her brother, or let me a&s;&s;ume the privilege of one. If I offered to ki&s;s her, &s;he would draw back and blu&s;h; and, when I called her my dear little &s;i&s;ter, &s;he very gravely would reply with a&mdash;<HI>Sir;</HI> which, at times, &s;he had &s;ome difficulty to pronounce. The Count perceived the change &s;ooner than I did.&mdash; "Either I am much deceived," &s;aid he, "or the heart of our young &s;i&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> begins to take part in my project; but tell me, dear Lindorf, what &s;ays yours? May I here|after call you brother?"</P>
<P>"I was too &s;incere to endeavour to conceal that I had hitherto felt nothing farther than friend&s;hip; "But certainly," &s;aid I to the Count, "my heart, already ex|hau&s;ted, is no longer capable of love, and &s;ince the charming Matilda fails to in&s;pire pa&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall never
<PB N="114" REF="034126_0113_0FFA9191044717C0">
feel it more." Ah, Caroline, how much was I de|ceived!</P>
<P>"You are mi&s;taken," replied he, "Lindorf; at three&punc; and twenty the heart is never &s;atiated with love: nor have you ever known love; for your pa&s;&s;ion for Loui&s;a was rather an efferve&s;cence of the &s;en&s;es than love it&s;elf; its exce&s;s was a proof of my a&s;&s;ertion, and I de&s;ire no better than your meditated elopement. When a lover, Lindorf, prefers his own enjoyment to the intere&s;t of the object beloved, you may be certain his heart is but feebly affected. My utmo&s;t wi&s;h is, that my &s;i&s;ter may make you feel the difference between your pa&s;&s;ion for Loui&s;a and the delicious &s;entiments of refined love. She is &s;till &s;ufficiently young to give me hope that this may happen; and, perhaps, it is her great youth that retards the de&s;ired event. You think her only a girl; but when this girl &s;hall di&s;cover &s;en&s;ibility, there will be but another &s;tep to in&s;pire you with &s;imilar &s;en&s;ations."</P>
<P>"I embraced the Count, and a&s;&s;ured him I had already love enough for Matilda, to think with plea&s;ure on the time when I &s;hould love her more, and when I might add the name of brother to that of friend; but that I had &s;till many errors to repair and to efface, and that his charm|ing &s;i&s;ter merited a heart wholly hers, and capable of feeling her worth.</P>
<P>"A &s;hort time after this conver&s;ation happened, Wal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n was appointed Amba&s;&s;ador to Ru&s;&s;ia. Our farewell was tender, and affected me greatly. Since the commi&s;|&s;ion of my crime (for what other name can I give it?) I never could behold the Count without a renewal of af|fliction and remor&s;e. That countenance, &s;o beautiful, that walk and figure, &s;o noble, that look, which expre&s;&s;|ed &s;o much, all ince&s;&s;antly haunted me. The Count &s;eemed to recollect nothing of this, nor to entertain the lea&s;t regret. Before we parted, I entreated him to give me his picture, &s;uch as it was when he came to Rone|bourg. I knew he had one, and I wi&s;hed he would be|queath it to me; that my own fault and his genero&s;ity might continually be recalled, and that I might be certain time &s;hould not enfeeble the remembrance of them.</P>
<P>"This he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed. "No, dear Lindorf," &s;aid he, "you &s;hall have no portrait of mine, neither pa&s;t nor pre&s;ent. I would have them forgotten as totally by you as they are by me. I never would have them men|tioned
<PB N="115" REF="034126_0114_0FFA9146AF2E9148">
more. I wi&s;h you only to remember our friend|&s;hip, which is, and ever &s;hall be inviolable."</P>
<P>"I did not per&s;i&s;t in my reque&s;t, becau&s;e I &s;aw him determined, and becau&s;e I had another re&s;ource. The young Counte&s;s, Matilda, had a miniature picture in a bracelet; but which, after his accident, &s;he no longer wore; and which, I believe, he him&s;elf had forgotten. I had no great difficulty in prevailing on her, under a promi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ecrecy, to &s;uffer a copy to be taken. It is this which I have now left with you, Caroline, and which I beg you to accept. You are the only per&s;on to whom I would have given that picture; but you, I am certain, will know its value. Look at it often; and, while you look, remember the beauteous mind which animated that once beauteous form &s;till exi&s;ts, with &s;till improving beauty, and increa&s;ing purity. "Yes, the change of his features gives Wal&s;tein new lu&s;tre, nor &s;hould the remaining &s;cars make you hold your hu&s;band in horror.&mdash;Ah! Caroline, you mu&s;t dete&s;t his wretched a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, but forget not his remor&s;e; remember his re|pentance! Think on what he &s;uffered while he was making this his confe&s;&s;ion, and conjuring you to love another; bani&s;hing him&s;elf for ever from your pre&s;ence. An expiation like this ought, almo&s;t, to make the crime forgotten, and to obtain a generous pardon.</P>
<P>"The Count, at parting, promi&s;ed to write to me, as often as the multiplicity of affairs in which he was going to engage would permit. Wholly devoted to his duty, he had little time for a corre&s;pondence of plea&s;ure, or even friend&s;hip. Soon after his arrival, however, at Peter&s;burg, I received the letters which I enclo&s;e in this packet; you will find them numbered according to the order in which they came. Read them, Caroline; your &s;pou&s;e is a much better painter of him&s;elf than I am."</P>
<P>Caroline took the letters, looked for No. I. and ha&s;|tily opened it. The hand-writing recalled to recollection the &s;hort penciled billet of the antichamber; the only one &s;he had ever received from Wal&s;tein, and the im|pre&s;&s;ion of which had been &s;o &s;trong, yet &s;o little dura|ble. She felt the angui&s;h of remor&s;e; and, for &s;ome moments, her tears impeded her &s;ight. At length &s;he began to read. The letter was dated from Peter&s;burgh, the year before her marriage, and was as follows:
<LETTER>
<PB N="116" REF="034126_0115_0FFA9192A88A24B0">
<HEAD>No. I. The Count of Wal&s;tein to the Baron of Lindorf.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Peter&s;burgh,
<DATE>July 7, 17&mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>'The letter I received, ye&s;terday, from Matilda, con|firmed what I long &s;u&s;pected. Yes, you are beloved, dear Lindorf: her innocent and pure mind is it&s;elf a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the new ideas which affect it, and has not had the art to conceal them from the penetrating friend&s;hip of a brother. Each phra&s;e, each word, in her letter, be|trays her &s;ecret; and I think my&s;elf guilty of no trea&s;on in revealing it to her hu&s;band&mdash;Yes, her hu&s;band, dear Lin|dorf!&mdash;In vain would your delicacy longer decline what friend&s;hip &s;o ardently de&s;ires; it now ought to yield to what I &s;hall &s;ay, or rather to what I &s;hall repeat. I have reflected a good deal on our la&s;t conver&s;ation. Becau&s;e you do not love my &s;i&s;ter with the &s;ame tran&s;port, with the &s;ame burning raptures you felt for Loui&s;a, you ima|gine your&s;elf unworthy of her, and conclude you never &s;hall love her. Yet, you acknowledge, and I believe you have the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip for Matilda, and that &s;he is the woman you at pre&s;ent would mo&s;t prefer, and the only one concerning whom you are any way intere&s;ted. What more is nece&s;&s;ary, dear Lindorf, to happine&s;s? Does a &s;en&s;ation &s;o &s;weet to the &s;oul leave any thing far|ther to wi&s;h? And, when to the&s;e are added the grati|tude you would feel for the love &s;he bears to you, do you &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould not make her perfectly happy? For my part, I think her happine&s;s much more certain, this way, than if you had a violent pa&s;&s;ion for her, which con&s;umes it&s;elf in its own flames, and leaves only regret and a painful void. Ever &s;ince I have thought of this union, which to &s;ee accompli&s;hed, would, I own, be one of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures of my life, I have &s;tudied the characters of you and Matilda much more attentively than you imagine; and each remark I have made has con|firmed and even convinced me you were born for each other. Without perhaps being &s;o beauteous as Loui&s;a, or, even, as many other women, my &s;i&s;ter has &s;omewhat in her figure which every day plea&s;es more, becau&s;e it every day is gaining &s;ome additional grace; and becau&s;e it con|&s;i&s;ts in that varied and animated play of countenance which is more plea&s;ing than a regularity of features, that are but too apt, by their &s;amene&s;s, to lo&s;e their charm.&mdash; Perhaps, you will tell me &s;he wants &s;en&s;ibility, and that
<PB N="117" REF="034126_0116_0FFA914A61A8BEB8">
you have too much. But &s;hall I &s;urpri&s;e you, nay, &s;hall I not vex you, dear Lindorf, when I &s;ay I believe Ma|tilda has at lea&s;t as much feeling as my friend him&s;elf? Under the apparent thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of childhood, if I mi&s;take not, I have di&s;covered the tendere&s;t, the mo&s;t affectionate heart, and the mo&s;t capable of a &s;trong and la&s;ting attachment. You &s;ee, already, this little in&s;en&s;i|ble has under&s;tanding enough to know your worth, to love you, and, I think, Lindorf, you will never have any complaints to make of her want of tenderne&s;s. Her mind, likewi&s;e, has tho&s;e propen&s;ities which be&s;t plea&s;e and fix the attention of yours. Her amiable vivacity, her uninterrupted gaiety, are qualities that will pre&s;erve you from dulne&s;s; which, of all the plagues of a conju|gal &s;tate, is one of the wor&s;t. Her gentlene&s;s and good temper will meliorate that natural warmth which &s;o often overpowers you, and, in your own de&s;pite, carries you beyond the bounds of moderation. I hear your reply, dear Lindorf. "Yes, my own happine&s;s, I &s;ee will be certain; but what will become of that of Matilda?" Be not unhappy on that account, my friend, for, once again I tell thee, I am not; and that, when I pre&s;s thee to marry my &s;i&s;ter, I fore&s;ee how thy heart, perhaps the mo&s;t excellent I have ever known, will act. Yes, Ma|tilda mu&s;t be happy, and I defy thee to prove the con|trary.

Love, my friend, is nothing more than a lively friend&s;hip founded on reciprocal e&s;teem, and improved on a difference of &s;ex.

<P>'P. S. The &s;teward of my e&s;tate at Wal&s;tein being lately dead, it has given me plea&s;ure to be&s;tow his place on the hone&s;t Ju&s;tin, who manages his farm excellently.

<P>Whether the letter from Ju&s;tin was by chance enclo&s;|ed in that of the Count, when &s;ent by Lindorf to Caro|line, or whether purpo&s;ely put there, does not greatly matter; but there it was, and we imagine our readers will be glad to read it, and once again recollect the beauteous Loui&s;a, whom certainly they have not yet forgotten.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>LETTER</HI> of <HI>JUSTIN.</HI> 'To his Excellency, my Lord, the Count of Wal&s;tein, Am|ba&s;&s;ador to the Court of Peter&s;burgh.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>'My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'I am certain, for I know my Lord's goodne&s;s, his heart would have been right glad if his Excellence had &s;een how happy his Lord&s;hip's letter made us all; nay, more happy than we were before, which, if any body had told us that &s;uch a thing might be, I am &s;ure we &s;hould have &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible. To be &s;ure, I did not think that ever the poor Ju&s;tin could have arrived at the honour of being my Lord the Count's &s;teward; tho' at pre&s;ent I feel, I am &s;ure, I can do my duty in the di&s;charge of that high office, of which I am as proud as if I were a King; and though I be not learned, I am certain I can do any thing to &s;erve my good and dear Lord; and I hope, when it &s;hall plea&s;e God to &s;end him back, that he will be &s;atisfied, and find every thing in good order.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="034126_0118_0FFA914E299B2750">'We have been in the &s;teward's apartment, at the chateau, for the&s;e two days pa&s;t. My dear Loui&s;a, at fir&s;t, was &s;orry to leave the farm; but &s;he tells me, now, &s;he finds as &s;he &s;hall be happy every where with me; tho' be this &s;aid with all re&s;pect to my Lord the Count, for I know one &s;hould not brag of one's &s;elf; but when one is the hu&s;band of Loui&s;a, and the &s;teward of my Lord the Count of Wal&s;tein, one may well be a little proud. Our good old father, too, is as proud as I am, and &s;o gay of heart that he &s;eems younger by ten years. He calls me nothing but my Lord the Count's &s;teward; and he drinks a gla&s;s of wine more, every meal, to the health and honour of my Lord. All of us, even to our two dear little poppets, are quite overjoyed at being at the cha|teau; and they are &s;o plea&s;ed to play in the gardens of my Lord the Count! The elde&s;t can go any where, the &s;turdy little rogue; and his young brother, who is not yet weaned, already begins to li&s;p the name of my Lord the Count, for that is the fir&s;t word we teach them; and when his grandfather drinks the health of my Lord he always takes off his bonnet. To be &s;ure they are two charming little knaves, and almo&s;t as beautiful as their mother.</P>
<P>'I &s;hould never dare to pre&s;ume to tell all this to my Lord the Amba&s;&s;ador if he had not commanded me to write him word of every thing that concerned our good old father, my dear Loui&s;a, and our little boys.&mdash;I had almo&s;t forgot the flageolet, but Loui&s;a, who knows my Lord the Count's letter by heart, made me recollect it; and &s;o I continue, as aforetime, to play to Loui&s;a, to amu&s;e her while &s;he gives the brea&s;t to the little one, and &s;o the bigge&s;t dances all the while I play, for this your Lord&s;hip knows is like the birds in their ne&s;ts; the male &s;ings while the female is &s;itting; and &s;o my Lord the Count will very well perceive I am the happie&s;t man this day on God's earth. Every thing goes its gait; all we undertake &s;ucceeds; and when we are in the mea|dow we &s;ee our four calves, three hens, and their broods of chickens, and I know not how many &s;heep, goats, and lambs, without reckoning our little boys, all playing a|round us; and all this my Lord the Count has given us, and &s;o it is my opinion that my Lord the Count is as hap|py, or perhaps even happier, than we are, becau&s;e <HI>he</HI> has done the good, and <HI>we</HI> have only received it: but it

ought to be &s;o; he wants nothing but a Loui&s;a, which may the good and bountiful God give him! We pray every day for my Lord the Count; for truly, my Lord has, after God him&s;elf, the fir&s;t place in our hearts. Wherefore, may God grant my Lord all his wi&s;hes and a long life to enjoy them in, which is the mo&s;t &s;incere prayer of his mo&s;t humble &s;ervants and &s;uperintendants of his e&s;tate at Wal&s;tein.</P>

<P>"You hear the prayers of the&s;e good people, Caroline, and Heaven has been plea&s;ed to hear them likewi&s;e.&mdash; Wal&s;tein has a Loui&s;a! No, not &s;o; he has a &s;till &s;uperior angel!</P>
<P>"I an&s;wered the Count's letter by the next courrier. Gratitude, the plea&s;ure of being &s;till dearer and nearer related <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o him, an ardent de&s;ire to merit the good opini|on he entertained of me, certitude of my own happine&s;s, and a promi&s;e to make Matilda happy; the&s;e my letter expre&s;&s;ed, and the&s;e my heart dictated. The only thing omitted was love; but the Count had ju&s;t &s;hewn me love was not nece&s;&s;ary to happine&s;s, but that it would be more certain from that kind of attachment which I felt for his &s;i&s;ter. Wal&s;tein had too great an a&s;cendant over me not to convince, and I was the more ea&s;y to per&s;uade from the belief of being beloved, which gave a degree of force to the favourable &s;entiments I had for the lovely Matilda. I no longer &s;aw her without emotion; and this became &s;ufficiently &s;trong to make me perfectly ea&s;y; when af|ter a conver&s;ation of &s;ome length held with her, &s;he gave me permi&s;&s;ion, though not without deep blu&s;hes, to a&s;k her aunt's con&s;ent, and endeavour to gain her over to the views of her brother.</P>
<P>"I thought it be&s;t, however, to wait, before I &s;poke to the Barone&s;s, till I had written to the Count, and re|ceived his promi&s;ed an&s;wer. This I told Matilda, who thought it very proper; and we no longer endeavoured to conceal an affection thus authorized by fraternal autho|rity.</P>
<P>"I continued, therefore, my daily vi&s;its at the Baro|ne&s;s de Za&s;trow's, and very a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly paid her my court, tho' with very little &s;ucce&s;s. After the departure of the Count her conduct to me had been wholly changed; al|ways polite but always di&s;tant, &s;he affected to receive me
<PB N="121" REF="034126_0120_0FFA914FD31E5150">
with great ceremony, and took her mea&s;ures &s;o well that I &s;eldom had an opportunity of &s;peaking a word in pri|vate to Matilda. The&s;e impediments and contradictions might natually have been expected to augment love; and, I own, I was &s;ecretly vexed, which did not pa&s;s unob|&s;erved by Matilda, and which con&s;oled her for her aunt's behaviour by per&s;uading her &s;he was beloved; and &s;o, no doubt, &s;he was; friend&s;hip, gratitude, attached me to her, and, had I then obtained her hand, I might my&s;elf have been well per&s;uaded my affection was much &s;tronger than it has proved.</P>
<P>"I waited, however, without any violent impatience the effect of the Count's promi&s;es and letter to his aunt. He wrote me word 'he had not yet been able to gain the con&s;ent of that lady, for &s;he tenaciou&s;ly adhered to her de&s;ign of marrying Matilda to the young Baron de Za&s;|trow, then on his travels. Yet that he, however, was &s;till more tenacious of his own, which certainly &s;hould be effective; for which rea&s;on he conjured me not to take offence, but to wait with patience. A con&s;iderable e&s;tate,' he &s;aid, 'depended on this aunt, which requi|red &s;ome caution; but that, by one means or other, he would obtain his end, and that he already regarded me as his brother.'</P>
<P>"I wi&s;hed to &s;hew Matilda this letter, and immedi|ately went to the hou&s;e of the Barone&s;s. I found it &s;hut up! No porter, not a &s;ingle &s;ervant, was there to whom I could &s;peak! This circum&s;tance appeared extremely &s;ingular; for, the very evening before, I had been re|ceived as u&s;ual, without the lea&s;t mention of a removal. I inquired in the neighbourhood, and was told the coach had &s;et off very early in the morning; but could learn nothing more. While I was remaining in the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, I &s;aw Matilda's maid coming to me. I ran to meet her, and was going to que&s;tion, but was prevent|ed by her telling me to a&s;k nothing, for that nothing &s;he knew. "I cannot tell you where they are," &s;aid &s;he. "Ye&s;terday, as &s;oon as you were gone, I heard my lady &s;peaking very loud, and Mi&s;s Matilda weeping&punc; All night long there was nothing but packing up, &s;colding, and crying; and, at la&s;t, I was paid my wages, di&s;char|ged, and they &s;et off in a coach; but Mi&s;s Matilda, when &s;he bade me farewell, &s;lipt this into my hand."</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="034126_0121_0FFA919BF77BEF08">"The maid then gave me a rumpled paper, addre&s;&s;ed to me; which, taking, I directly opened, but without at fir&s;t being able to comprehend a word of its contents. It &s;eemed an inventory of chairs, tables, and furniture. At la&s;t, I di&s;covered that what regarded my&s;elf was interlin|ed, and was as follows:</P>
<P>'Oh! Mr. Lindorf, we are going to depart for Dre&s;|den, pre&s;ently; and we are to &s;tay there a long, long while; perhaps forever. What will you think when you &s;hall come to-morrow and find your poor young friend gone? Will you grieve as much as &s;he does? I hope you will be a little &s;orry; yet do not afflict your&s;elf too much; for I promi&s;e you my thoughts will be the &s;ame at Dre&s;|den as they were at Berlin, and &s;o they will forever conti|nue to be. Be&s;ides, have I not a brother, a dear good brother? Write to him immediately; and, &s;hould you wi&s;h to &s;end a word in an&s;wer to this, let it be under cover to him, for there are no other means of its arriving at me. No, if you write to me&punc; your letter; mu&s;t fir&s;t go to Ru&s;&s;ia. But what of that, if I but get them at la&s;t?&mdash; I wi&s;h I were as &s;ure this would come to your hands. I could contrive no means of writing to you, but, luckily, my aunt gave me an inventory to copy. When &s;he looks at me, I &s;et down a figure, and the moment &s;he is gone&punc; write a line. When it is done, perhaps, I may give it to poor Nancy, whom my aunt intends to turn away, be|cau&s;e &s;he might a&s;&s;i&s;t us, and becau&s;e &s;he loves you. I am &s;ure &s;he will give it you, faithfully &mdash;I am vexed to be obliged to write thus clande&s;tinely and deceive my aunt; yet &s;he has had no remor&s;e at deceiving me. Till this very night I knew not a word of our departure; no, I prote&s;t to you, I did not know a word of it. Is it not a &s;hocking thing to &s;et off without &s;eeing you? I &s;carcely can write for crying, and I hear my aunt coming. My paper is no more like an inventory, &s;o I mu&s;t hide it, and begin another. Farewell, Mr. Lindorf, I will re|member you and pray for you continually; and do not forget the poor Matilda, and do not think ill of her be|cau&s;e &s;he has written to you fir&s;t.'</P>
<P>"Such was the letter of Matilda, on reading of which it was impo&s;&s;ible, without any violent love, not to be af|fected at the native &s;implicity of the niece, and piqued at the behaviour of the aunt. I felt both the&s;e &s;en&s;ations in their full force, and returned to my chamber, where I

immediately wrote an account of all that had pa&s;&s;ed to Wal&s;tein, and of the unworthy artifice that had been u&s;ed. I believe anger was &s;tronger than regret, for I in|&s;inuated to the Count that I looked upon our project as impracticable; and, &s;ince Madame de Za&s;trow was &s;o de|termined, to renounce it appeared to me the wi&s;e&s;t way, I enclo&s;ed a copy of the letter from Matilda, and my an|&s;wer, de&s;iring her brother to &s;end it to her; and I re|ceived a letter from the Count, by the return of the po&s;t, as follows."</P>

<HEAD>No. II. The Count of Wal&s;tein to the Baron of Lindorf.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Peter&s;burg,
<DATE>July 18, 17&mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>'I am exceedingly angry, dear Lindorf, at the trick out good aunt, de Za&s;trow, has played us; but her ef|forts are fruitle&s;s, Matilda &s;hall be yours. I declare, nay, have &s;worn, my &s;i&s;ter &s;hall not become the victim of her ob&s;tinacy. I have nothing to allege again&s;t the young Baron de Za&s;trow, whom I have not the honour of know|ing, and to whom I wi&s;h all manner of happine&s;s, except that of being the hu&s;band of Matilda. You, Lindorf, has &s;he &s;elected, and you, already, doth her young heart pre|fer. No, that innocent and open heart, which &s;poke all its &s;ecrets with &s;uch ingenuous confidence to me, &s;hall not be deceived in its wi&s;hes; &s;hall not have to combat a pa&s;&s;ion to which I my&s;elf may be &s;aid to have given birth; nor &s;hall &s;he have to blu&s;h for having fir&s;t written to any other man than her hu&s;band. Poor dear girl! how much did her billet affect me! I will write immediately, to con&s;ole her, and afford her no very di&s;tant pro&s;pect of felicity: a little per&s;everence and we &s;hall conquer. I will enclo&s;e your letter, likewi&s;e, which, I believe, will be more effectual than mine. By the &s;ame po&s;t I will write to my aunt, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, a&s;&s;ert the rights a dying father bequeathed to me over my &s;i&s;ter. <HI>To you I confide her and the care of her future happine&s;s;</HI> nor, oh! my father will I betray this tru&s;t. Matilda and Lindorf &s;hall be one, and your dear girl, then, cannot fail of be|ing happy! Take courage, therefore&punc; my friend, and be a&s;&s;ured our project &s;hall &s;ucceed. Matilda is yet but fif|teen; in three or four years &s;he will be more formed, more capable of happine&s;s, more worthy of her&s;elf and you. My only fear is that, you being &s;eparate from her, that heart, &s;o &s;uddenly become cold, in&s;en&s;ible, that heart,
<PB N="124" REF="034126_0123_0FFA919DCE050CE0">
no longer &s;u&s;ceptible of love, as you have &s;uppo&s;ed, may, in the mean time, &s;tand convicted of its error, and find that it never yet knew the pa&s;&s;ion. If, dear Lindorf, this misfortune &s;hould happen, promi&s;e me, &s;wear to me, you will neither &s;acrifice your&s;elf nor my &s;i&s;ter to engage|ments which, from that moment, will cea&s;e to exi&s;t. I am de&s;irous of this union no farther than as I am per&s;ua|ded it will not be a misfortune to either party, and would rather have to comfort Matilda for the lo&s;s of a lover than for the indifference of the hu&s;band of her heart. There|fore, Lindorf, the very moment &s;he would no longer be the wife you would prefer to all others, the very moment you are convinced &s;ome other woman may render you more happy, have the fortitude to inform your friend of this change, and be a&s;&s;ured that, in&s;tead of dimini&s;h|ing, by this conduct, you will redouble his e&s;teem. I think violent love no way nece&s;&s;ary to conjugal felicity. I have &s;aid &s;o in my former letter&punc; and I per&s;i&s;t in the opinion; but I am &s;till more effectually convinced that a hu&s;band and wife ought, at lea&s;t, mutually to prefer each other to the whole world, and never know regret at the remembrance of being united for life. I think it nece&s;&s;ary that that agreement of ta&s;te and feeling, that entire confidence, that bond of affection, &s;hould be found which cannot exi&s;t if one of the two love another, and be obliged to conceal the thoughts by which he or &s;he is mo&s;t occupied.&mdash;The&s;e con&s;iderations, I own, have hi|therto hindered me from marrying and yielding to the wi&s;hes and entreaties of my family, which, with me, will become extinct. I dread le&s;t my pre&s;ent rank and favour might engage &s;ome woman, to whom I might addre&s;s my&s;elf, to marry me, though &s;he really loved another. I fear acquiring rights which I &s;hall find are u&s;urpations, and over a heart that has other engagements. I dread being the uncon&s;cious cau&s;e of mi&s;ery to two lovers, and being my&s;elf &s;till more mi&s;erable when I &s;hall have made the di&s;covery. You know me too well, dear Lindorf, ever to imagine I can mean to reproach when I thus &s;peak my &s;ecret &s;entiments. You know my manner of thinking relative to the accident that has altered my per|&s;on; it is ever the &s;ame; and, I again prote&s;t, I every day congratulate my&s;elf on the pre&s;ent opportunity I en|joy of indulging my mo&s;t prevalent inclination, and fol|lowing the &s;tudies in which I mo&s;t delight; happy in

having had the means, in my former &s;tation, of giving tho&s;e proofs of courage and zeal in the &s;ervice of my King which I mo&s;t wi&s;hed; and, in my pre&s;ent, of &s;er|ving him, as I think, much more effectually. A good mini&s;ter, Lindorf, is &s;till a greater character than a good general. It is my greate&s;t plea&s;ure to fulfil the duties of the office to which I am appointed; and this office, I repeat it, is much more agreeable to me than the life of a &s;oldier; therefore I <HI>can</HI> have nothing to regret; nothing, nothing&mdash;Yet I mu&s;t do my&s;elf ju&s;tice. I may not now hope to in&s;pire love, nor do I make any &s;uch weak pretences; and, perhaps, it may be for that rea&s;on I per&s;uade my&s;elf that love is not nece&s;&s;ary to happine&s;s. But I wi&s;h, at lea&s;t, to find a woman who has no partiality for another. I do not even &s;hrink from a &s;light repugnance, at fir&s;t; that is natural, and what I ought to expect. My endeavours mu&s;t be to di&s;pel it by degrees, and make my&s;elf beloved fir&s;t through gratitude, and afterwards from habit. The eye would &s;oon accom|modate it&s;elf to my per&s;on, and my &s;ole &s;tudy &s;hould be to make it forgotton by my actions. Is it po&s;&s;ible that a woman mu&s;t not, at la&s;t, love him who exi&s;ts but to ren|der her happy; who would prevent her wi&s;hes, to which his own would be ever &s;ub&s;ervient, and who would be grateful for the &s;malle&s;t marks of attachment which &s;he might be&s;tow! Such, my friend, are the loved illu&s;ions of my heart, and which I yet, one day, hope to behold realized. I fore&s;ee all the ob&s;tacles, but they di&s;courage me not. I know how difficult it is to find a woman who&s;e heart is entirely free, without which my whole &s;cheme would be fru&s;trated; for compari&s;ons would ince&s;&s;antly be made between me and the regretted, the beloved object. I &s;hould be looked upon as a mon&s;ter. Partiality and bitter remembrance would poi&s;on life.&mdash; But, could I meet &s;ome young heart, &s;uch as I wi&s;h, and &s;uch as I &s;hall ince&s;&s;antly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eavour to find, &s;imple and innocent, unacquainted with love and with little know|ledge of the world; if &s;uch I find, it &s;hall be mine, even though I &s;hould oblige her to marry me; for I would render her happy in her own de&s;pite.

<P>The remainder of the letter related only to political affairs, and accounts of Ru&s;&s;ia, which Caroline &s;kipped over, or read uncon&s;ciou&s;ly; her thoughts had other em|ployment, and her heart was not capacious enough for her own affairs. She &s;eemed as if tran&s;ported into ano|ther world, of which, till then, &s;he had no idea. This la&s;t letter particularly &s;truck her. She read it again, and with &s;en&s;ations &s;omewhat painful. The prediction of the love of Lindorf, the exce&s;&s;ive fear of Wal&s;tein, le&s;t he &s;hould marry a woman who&s;e heart was pre-engaged, made a &s;evere impre&s;&s;ion on her. When &s;he came to
<PB N="127" REF="034126_0126_0FFA915918A645B0">
Wal&s;tein's project of happine&s;s, and to the motives which had induced him to marry her, &s;he found her&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding her repugnance, &s;o affected, that, at the moment, &s;he thought &s;he loved him only in the world; or, rather, &s;he did not her&s;elf under&s;tand her own feelings. She remained with her eyes fixed on this letter, without remembering that the manu&s;cript was not ended. Her enthu&s;ia&s;m, at length, vani&s;hed by de|grees; the idea of the Count was effaced, and the image of Lindorf regained a part of its former empire. The letter was laid down, and the manu&s;cript once more ta|ken up.</P>
<P>"Time fails, Caroline, and the four-and-twenty hours I have dedicated to this painful work are almo&s;t ended. I already perceive the fir&s;t rays of day, of that day on which, perhaps, for the la&s;t time I &s;hall behold her, to whom, ye&s;terday, at the &s;ame hour, I hoped to devote my life. How happy was I then! How did the &s;weet chimeras of hope and love flatter my heart! A &s;ingle moment has de&s;troyed them all, has plunged me into an aby&s;s of de&s;pair!&mdash;Yet what complaints are the&s;e? Ought I thus to employ the few remaining minutes in which I would conduct you to happine&s;s, by pointing out the road? Yes, Caroline, you will be, mu&s;t be hap|py; and the certainty of this will be the &s;ole con&s;olation of my future exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>"The whole year pa&s;&s;ed without the lea&s;t change of circum&s;tance or &s;ituation. Matilda remained at Dre&s;den, the Count in Ru&s;&s;ia, and I at Berlin. An uninterrupted corre&s;pondence maintained our mutual connections, but that of Dre&s;den, pa&s;&s;ing fir&s;t by Peter&s;burg, was neither very frequent nor very animated. Matilda, educated in re&s;traint, and even with &s;everity, dur&s;t not indulge her feelings; and, at the utmo&s;t, expre&s;&s;ed friend&s;hip only. My an&s;wers nearly a&s;&s;umed the &s;ame tone; yet, determi|ned to e&s;pou&s;e her as &s;oon as her aunt would con&s;ent, and preferring her to all the women I then knew, I care|fully avoided every occa&s;ion of meeting objects who might eradicate the&s;e ideas, and take place of her in my heart.</P>
<P>"To deprive my&s;elf of the plea&s;ures of courts co&s;t me but little. Ever &s;ince the unfortunate adventure of Lou|i&s;a and the Count I had pre&s;erved an habitual melancholy, which well accorded with my future intentions. Whol|ly devoted to my military occupations and paying my
<PB N="128" REF="034126_0127_0FFA91A42FA9EF50">
duty to the King, I employed the remainder of my time in riding, mu&s;ic, or reading.</P>
<P>"An unfortunate event happened which di&s;turbed my tranquillity and increa&s;ed my melancholy. My fa|ther, who remained at Ronebourg, had an apoplectic fit; my mother, who had long been in a feeble and ill &s;tate of health, &s;carcely could &s;upport her grief and terror. I was in&s;tantly &s;ent for, and found them both, on my ar|rival, in great danger. The &s;ight of me appeared to ani|mate them; my mother e&s;pecially, who loved me with mo&s;t affectionate tenderne&s;s, found her&s;elf &s;en&s;ibly bet|ter, which &s;he attributed to my pre&s;ence and cares; but the &s;tate in which &s;he &s;till remained required every atten|tion I could be&s;tow. I wrote to court to obtain leave of ab&s;ence. My motive was too &s;acred for me to be refu&s;ed, and I devoted my whole time and faculties to my parents.</P>
<P>"It was during this ab&s;ence, Caroline, that you came to embelli&s;h the Court I had quitted; and it was then al&s;o the Count had that unfortunate &s;ickne&s;s which de|tained him &s;o long on the road, and which I heard of by accident. At any other moment I &s;hould have flown to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but I was then detained at Ronebourg, by duties too &s;acred, and too dear, to admit even the idea.</P>
<P>"Some time after, I had the plea&s;ure to learn, from him&s;elf, he had recovered and arrived at Berlin. His letter had an enigmatic and my&s;terious turn, which I re|marked when I read it fir&s;t&mdash;'He would have given,' he &s;aid, 'the whole world to &s;ee and &s;peak to me. The cruel event which detained me at Ronebourg, was the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to him, becau&s;e he ab&s;olutely could not come thither, on account of the di&s;tance (Ronebourg is at the farther end of Sile&s;ia, and four long days journey from Berlin) and the little time he had to remain in Pru&s;&s;ia, during which every moment would be occupied. He then &s;poke of Matilda, was grieved at the perver&s;ity of her aunt, but was determined, he &s;aid, the in&s;tant I &s;hould be at liberty to leave Ronebourg, to exert his au|thority and terminate our marriage.&mdash;He had a new mo|tive for ha&s;tening the affair.&mdash;Perhaps he was him&s;elf on the point of being happy&mdash;of obtaining what he &s;o ar|dently de&s;ired; but he could not enjoy perfect content unle&s;s I enjoyed it al&s;o.'</P>
<P>"I paid le&s;s attention to this letter than I &s;hould have done at any other time; for &s;carcely had I time to read
<PB N="129" REF="034126_0128_0FFA915ACE7C3C98">
it, nor have I, till now, hardly recollected it &s;ince. I received it on the very day on which my father, after having langui&s;hed four months, expired in my arms, re|commending my mother to me, and commanding me not to leave her.</P>
<P>"Alas! my heart had already fore-run the command, which was it&s;elf to me a law. Already had &s;worn, to the tendere&s;t of mothers, that her &s;on, her only &s;on, would not abandon her in the hour of her affliction!</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as I had rendered my father the la&s;t duties of humanity, I wrote to the Count to inform him of my lo&s;s, and to entreat he would obtain a renewal of my leave of ab&s;ence; and the King not only permitted me to re|main at Ronebourg, but deigned, likewi&s;e, to approve the motive that made me wi&s;h to &s;tay.</P>
<P>"The Count, in his an&s;wer, wrote in a &s;tyle of me|lancholy that did not &s;urpri&s;e me. I knew how &s;en&s;ibly his heart was affected by, and partook of, the afflictions of his friends; be&s;ide, he him&s;elf had a &s;trong attach|ment to my father. He made no references to the &s;ubject of his former letter, which had been mi&s;laid in the grief of the terrible moment in which it was received, and I had almo&s;t forgot its contents&punc; He only &s;aid he &s;hould go immediately to Dre&s;den, being de&s;irous to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter before he returned into Ru&s;&s;ia; he added that, if it were po&s;&s;ible, he would al&s;o come to Ronebourg, but dur&s;t not promi&s;e; and, in fact, did not come.</P>
<P>"Wherefore, Oh! where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e did he not then confide to me the fatal &s;ecret? Yet, no doubt, his delicacy would not &s;uffer him to increa&s;e my pre&s;ent pangs, by informing me of an event of which I could not help knowing my|&s;elf to be the original cau&s;e.</P>
<P>"Three months more pa&s;&s;ed away, &s;till more &s;orrow|ful, &s;till more painful than the preceding. I had but one object of attention&punc; filial affection was, now, &s;olely attach|ed to my mother, whom I beheld daily decline, without other hope, other con&s;olation, than that of &s;oothing her la&s;t moments. At length, I lo&s;t her, al&s;o. Her pure &s;oul quitted its terre&s;trial re&s;idence, and rejoiced at the hope of once again meeting her hu&s;band, and expiring in the arms of her &s;on.</P>
<P>"Pardon, Oh Caroline! this gloomy narrative. I have need of the &s;upport of former misfortunes to enable me to endure the pre&s;ent; and am obliged to retrace antece|dent

lo&s;&s;es, now, when I &s;uffer one which might have con&s;oled me for them all. It is nece&s;&s;ary for me ince&s;|&s;antly to remember that man is born to be unhappy, and that mi&s;ery is his portion; that he is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to lo&s;e every object he held mo&s;t dear, and for whom he only wi&s;hed to live. No, happine&s;s is not for man&mdash;at lea&s;t only for one man&mdash;and his virtues, perhaps, make it his right. I, certainly, ought not to murmur.</P>
<P>"After the death of my father, I fled from Ronebourg; it was become a hated place, as well by the double lo&s;s I &s;o lately had &s;u&s;tained as by the act of barbarity I former|ly had committed there. I returned to Berlin and Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|dam, where I pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the winter, and lived &s;till more retired than the year before. The Count wrote &s;eldom, and, when he did, his &s;tyle &s;eemed em|barra&s;&s;ed and gloomy; and, at length, I began to perceive there was &s;omething which lay heavy at his heart. I told him &s;o, he owned it, but deferred a full explanation till he &s;hould &s;ee me in per&s;on. This was to be in the following autumn, which was the time, al&s;o, he had fixed for my marriage with his &s;i&s;ter. 'Thy de&s;tiny and mine,' &s;aid he, 'Lindorf, will then be finally determined. Oh! may they be happy! Or, if I my&s;elf am obliged to re|nounce bli&s;s, may, at lea&s;t, the felicity of my &s;i&s;ter and my friend &s;upply the lo&s;s of what I dare not hope!'</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;ed he had a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian lady, and that he found in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles; but, re&s;pect|ing his &s;ecret, I cea&s;ed my inquiries. I likewi&s;e occa&s;i|onally received &s;hort letters from Matilda, which always were fir&s;t &s;ent to her brother. Her aunt remained fixed in her opinion, and had written for the young Baron de Za&s;trow to return from his travels. Her inheritance was only to be Matilda's on condition this marriage took place; but the generous girl was ready to forego every advan|tage, and a&s;ked me, with an affecting openne&s;s of hearts&punc; whether it were not a thou&s;and times better to have le&s;s riches and more happine&s;s. For my part, I little regret|ted the lo&s;s of Madam de Za&s;trow's fortune; for my own, by the death of my parents, had become con&s;iderable, and was very largely increa&s;ed by the decea&s;e of the Commander of Ri&s;berg, my maternal uncle. He lived, like a hermit, on the e&s;tate I at pre&s;ent inhabit; would never &s;ee me while living, and left me all his wealth at his death, under the condition, however, that I &s;hould
<PB N="131" REF="034126_0130_0FFA915CB780FFE8">
marry within two years, and give the name of Ri&s;berg to my elde&s;t &s;on. My engagements with Matilda made the fulfilling of this clau&s;e apparently ea&s;y; and, perhaps, to this motive might have contributed to decide Ma|dame de Za&s;trow in my favour.</P>
<P>"Since that time, Caroline, how kind have I thought the obligation laid on me by my uncle's will! How &s;weet has the idea been of marrying within much le&s;s than the time pre&s;cribed! How many future joys did I dare ex|pect, and how &s;incerely did I ble&s;s my uncle's memory! &mdash;At pre&s;ent, I renounce, for ever renounce his gift. I pretend not to wealth to which I have no right; and will quit an e&s;tate, to-morrow, to which I am never to re|turn. What to me are riches and e&s;tates? Or what, alas! can I &s;uffer now?&mdash;I have nothing to lo&s;e!</P>
<P>"Oh pardon! pardon! Caroline! How may the vows of a wretch whom it is your duty to forget affect you? I add to my crimes by continuing to adore you; and the purpo&s;e of this writing is to make reparation.</P>
<P>"Determined no longer to remain at Ronebourg, which retraced &s;orrowful thoughts, only, and heart-rending re|collections, and which, be&s;ide, is too far di&s;tant from the capital, I was delighted with the acqui&s;ition of Ri&s;berg, and came to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, at the beginning of the &s;um|mer, a &s;hort time after my uncle's decea&s;e.&mdash;Caroline &mdash;It is here, at this place, at this moment, that I have need of all my fortitude to continue the fatal recital.&mdash; Angel adored! can I &s;peak to you of your&s;elf, and of what my feelings were, and are, and not expire!</P>
<P>"Sacred and pure Friend&s;hip! Thou who &s;houlde&s;t expiate the crimes Love hath committed&punc; thou who, henceforth, only &s;houlde&s;t find place in my heart, return and animate my zeal; once more return, and &s;u&s;tain re|lap&s;ing Nature!</P>
<P>"I was charmed with my new abode, yet did not in|tend to &s;tay here long; and was, therefore, de&s;irous of examining the neighbourhood. The evening before that day on which I fir&s;t beheld you, at the window of the pavilion, I had accidentally pa&s;&s;ed and heard tho&s;e &s;weet and harmonious &s;ounds, that affecting and angelic voice, the impre&s;&s;ions of which have &s;ince been &s;o powerful, and the effects of which, indeed, I felt the very moment they fir&s;t were heard. Never before had I heard a voice of &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility. I li&s;tened for &s;ome time after you

had cea&s;ed to &s;ing, and &s;till thought I heard &s;ounds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o corre&s;pondent to the feelings of my heart. Nay, I con|tinued to hear them, even at a di&s;tance; and, the next day, impatiently vi&s;ited the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>"Pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic, to that alone did I attri|bute that irre&s;i&s;tible attraction by which I was led thither. I will, however, confe&s;s I was, indeed, mo&s;t de&s;irous to &s;ee the per&s;on of her who&s;e power over the heart I found &s;o great; but this I attributed to curio&s;ity. I imagined that, by &s;inging with you, I might bring you to the win|dow; and the &s;tratagem was &s;uccce&s;sful. I beheld you! Though but for a moment; but that moment was &s;ufficient. The impre&s;&s;ion it made never can be forgotten; and my fir&s;t wi&s;h was I might have beheld you ever.</P>
<P>"Wherefore, Oh! wherefore may I not dwell on incidents once &s;o dear to memory? Wherefore not re|trace each circum&s;tance, recount each rapturous event of time which fled &s;o &s;wift away; and which has left me|mentos &s;o fatal in my heart! Ah! happy I! when, my &s;oul ab&s;orbed by &s;en&s;ations of bli&s;s &s;o pure, &s;en&s;ations of which, till then, I had been wholly ignorant, I exi&s;ted only at Rindaw, forgotten of the world be&s;ide! Ah how happy! when, leaving you in the evening, my &s;ole idea was that of &s;eeing you again on the morrow; and while that idea was &s;o va&s;t, &s;o perfect, that it excluded every other! Not tho&s;e burning, re&s;i&s;tle&s;s and tumultuous &s;en&s;a|tions that Loui&s;a in&s;pired; nor yet that monotonous tran|quillity, that indolence of heart, and apathy of &s;en&s;e Matilda gave, did I feel. No; the charm was new, delicious, exqui&s;ite! It was another world which Ca|roline embelli&s;hed! I beheld her in every &s;urrounding object; or, rather, I beheld no other object but her.&mdash; The only letter I wrote, during two months, was to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s the &s;ummer at Ri&s;berg, which I ob|tained, and I thought tho&s;e two months an eternity! The pa&s;t forgotton, to the future blind, the pre&s;ent was Heaven, for Caroline was pre&s;ent!</P>
<P>"Yet wherefore &s;eek to redouble my torments, by painting happine&s;s foregone? Alas! I had forgotten that I ought no more to &s;peak of my&s;elf; forgotten that Caroline is the wife of the be&s;t, the &s;ublime&s;t of mortals! Yes, of him I will &s;peak, of him only.</P>
<P>"About a month &s;ince, I received a letter from him; and this letter fir&s;t awakened me from this inebriety of

They have been but as a moment, and yet have I volumes to write concerning them, though not a &s;ingle incident which Wal&s;tein will not approve.&mdash;Oh, my friend&punc; in her are united every talent, every grace, and every virtue. Beauty is the lea&s;t of her advantages; for, infinite as this is, it is remembered no more when the &s;ound of her voice is heard, when her fingers touch the chords of harmony, or animate the lifele&s;s canva&s;s.

<P>I feel too well any longer to doubt that, without her, for me there cannot be happine&s;s.

<HEAD>No. IV. From the Count of Wal&s;tein to the Baron of Lindorf, at Berlin.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Peter&s;burg,

<P>'Love, dear Lindorf, of her and love; think of the&s;e, and remember not aught el&s;e the univer&s;e contains. Or, &s;hould Love grant a moment to Friend&s;hip, employ that moment to a&s;&s;ure thy&s;elf that a friend participates thy joys.&mdash;Happy Lindorf! Thou love&s;t and art beloved! Thou ha&s;t found the mate of thy heart, the &s;ympathizing mind which the &s;upreme Creator modelled after thy own, his fiat formed ye for each other. And feare&s;t thou then I &s;hould oppo&s;e a decree &s;o immutable; that I &s;hould tear thee from her who was written thine in the fir&s;t re|cords of eternity? Thy letter has removed all doubts; not a phra&s;e, not a word is there which does not breathe love. It is a pa&s;&s;ion thou knowe&s;t too well how to de|&s;cribe, not both to feel it and in&s;pire. In thee I behold
<PB N="138" REF="034126_0137_0FFA91AD15984A30">
that &s;upreme felicity the &s;eeds of which have been depo|&s;ited in my own heart, and of which I have &s;ometimes doubted the actual exi&s;tence. Something of it I beheld in the loves of Loui&s;a and Ju&s;tin, but this I attributed to country &s;implicity, and &s;uppo&s;ed it impo&s;&s;ible to be found el&s;ewhere. Oh! how grateful is it to my heart to know that this felicity has been realized by my friend, to have proof it is not wholly bani&s;hed this earth; and of the&s;e proofs thy letter is full; even to that &s;acrifice which thou with &s;uch &s;incerity offere&s;t, but which I &s;hould be a barbarian to accept. My affection for my &s;i&s;ter, were yours, Lindorf, out of the que&s;tion, would en&s;ure my refu&s;al. You are a man of honour, and I know you &s;incere, when you a&s;&s;ure me, you would be careful never to let Matilda perceive &s;he was not the wife of your heart; but how might you keep this fatal &s;ecret? Alas, my friend, I am convinced it is impo&s;&s;i|ble &s;o to deceive a woman, and the mi&s;ery of both would be the inevitable con&s;equence of a di&s;covery.</P>
<P>'No Lindorf, I wi&s;h your delicacy and con&s;cience to be wholly at ea&s;e, re&s;pecting our dear Matilda. I own &s;he is &s;trongly attached to you, and that you are the fir&s;t and only man who has made any progre&s;s in her affec|tions. But, whether it be the effect of character, educa|tion, or of youth, her &s;en&s;ations are not of that profound and determined &s;pecies on which the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of life depends; nor am I certain that we ought to give them the name of love.</P>
<P>'It has &s;eemed to me that her feelings are rather the effect of a fervid imagination, than of the heart, which, perhaps, have been heightened by oppo&s;ition; and that friend&s;hip has been mi&s;taken for love. During my late vi&s;it at Dre&s;den, I was &s;truck with the levity, and even gaiety, with which &s;he &s;upported your ab&s;ence and her own chagrin. It is true, &s;he always &s;peaks of you with infinite tenderne&s;s, but &s;he laughed and cried both in a breath; and a moment after &s;he had vowed eternal love for you, would begin to &s;ing and dance. I was not un|ea&s;y on this account, becau&s;e, I own, I partly fore&s;aw what has happened; and, &s;uppo&s;ing I had been deceived in this, I, for my part, was well plea&s;ed with this kind of pa&s;&s;ion; if you were united it might become every thing you wi&s;hed, and, if not, Matil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght ea&s;ily re|ceive con&s;olation, and be glad to hear of your happine&s;s&punc;

He, per|haps, may contribute to her tranquillity; but, be it as it may, make not your&s;elf unea&s;y; re&s;t a&s;&s;ured both bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter will find their happine&s;s in yours. I, therefore, relea&s;e you from every obligation, dear Lin|dorf, and only have to blame you for having &s;uppo&s;ed it po&s;&s;ible I could do otherwi&s;e. Fly, the moment you have received this letter, and pay your homage to the lady you love, and who, if I may judge from your de|&s;cription, &s;o tran&s;cendantly de&s;erves to be beloved; nor, have I any cau&s;e to doubt it, for, with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of pa&s;&s;ion, you &s;eem to have pre&s;erved the coolne&s;s of rea&s;on. How impatient am I to judge for my&s;elf! To &s;ee, hear, and, as you your&s;elf &s;ay, to applaud your choice! Nor will it be long before I &s;hall enjoy this plea&s;ure. Preparations are made for my return to Berlin; you mu&s;t direct no more letters to me at Peter&s;burg. I &s;hall be on the road when you receive this, and &s;oon af|terwards in your arms. We &s;hall then, dear Lindorf, no longer have any thing to conceal from each other, for hitherto we have mutually had &s;ome re&s;erve. I &s;hall learn who your beloved is, and you will then be inform|ed of a &s;ecret which, hitherto, a combination of circum|&s;tances has obliged me to keep; nay, indeed, to have afflicted you would but have added to my own grief, for my &s;orrows were of a kind that admitted not of allevia|tion. When I return, they, perhaps, may cea&s;e, and perhaps, al&s;o, I may then be de&s;tined never to enjoy that felicity, which I do not envy you, Lindorf, but which I yet mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h to partake. Oh! my friend, there is another <HI>She,</HI> another beloved, in exi&s;t|ence, who, when you &s;hall know, will not a little &s;ur|pri&s;e you.&mdash;But not a word of this till I &s;ee you. I hope to find you either happy or on the point of becoming &s;o. This, at lea&s;t, is a certain bli&s;s; and with this, if &s;o my de&s;tiny &s;hould decree, I mu&s;t endeavour to re&s;t content. Farewell! Should you mention your friend to the mi&s;tre&s;s of your heart, &s;hould you tell her &s;he has &s;uper&s;eded his &s;i&s;ter, tell her likewi&s;e &s;he has gained a brother, nay, perhaps, a &s;i&s;ter al&s;o, of whom may &s;he become the friend, and whom may &s;he render as much alive to love as &s;he her&s;elf is.

<P>"You know the re&s;t, Caroline: I have done. It is not for words to tell you either what I felt after reading this letter, or after finding how pre&s;umptuous and culpa|ble my hopes had been. I began this manu&s;cript the moment I got home, ye&s;terday. The time has been &s;hort; my wearied hand and eyes &s;carce have power to trace an adieu which my tears would efface; or to &s;upplicate your pardon for an unfortunate man who has di&s;turbed your future tranquillity. Oh! may he be wholly forgotten by you, and may you recover that pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, that &s;erenity of &s;oul without which happine&s;s may not be. Oh! Caroline, believe the friend who knows your heart better, at this moment, than you your&s;elf, and who knows, al&s;o the man to whom, henceforth, it is your duty to con&s;ecrate this your heart, your life; it is with him, only, by mak|ing him as happy as he de&s;erves, that you can find hap|pine&s;s your&s;elf. But you have read, and ju&s;tice and love by this time mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence. This &s;entence cannot but be in favour of Wal&s;tein, and I have nothing more to add.</P>
<P>"I have not yet come to any determination re&s;pecting my&s;elf; I neither know what I &s;hall do, or what &s;ay, to Wal&s;tein. I ought, perhaps, to tell him all; but a word which e&s;caped me in my letter, a word I would redeem with my life, has for ever &s;ealed my lips."</P>
<P>"No, Caroline, never &s;hall the&s;e lips, or this heart pronounce your name. I will even deprive my&s;elf of that con&s;olation. Farewell Caroline, farewell&mdash;for ever! &mdash;Ay, for ever; for never more mu&s;t I &s;ee you, unle&s;s I could cea&s;e to love you. Oh! might this love become &s;o &s;anctified, that I might only behold, in you, the wife of Wal&s;tein. Oh! might I re&s;tore each of you a friend
<PB N="141" REF="034126_0140_0FFA916F6306A108">
worthy of your&s;elves!&mdash;This or death is all I have to hope!&mdash;Adieu, adieu! I fly to give you this; once more to behold you&mdash;No, not to behold. I will not look on Caroline! You are the wife of my friend; the Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein. Yes, to the Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein I am bringing the&s;e papers, this picture. Caroline is no lon|ger in being; not Lindorf's Caroline!&mdash;You are now at the pavilion, I fly. Oh! Heaven grant me fortitude, &s;u&s;tain me in this fearful moment!"</P>
<P>We &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe what were the &s;en&s;a|tions of Caroline after what &s;he had read. Who may ex|pre&s;s all that pa&s;&s;ed in a heart divided between love, re|mor&s;e, admiration, and, perhaps, even a tincture of jea|lou&s;y? Loui&s;a and Matilda, by turns, drew her attention; &s;he read again the pa&s;&s;ages that related to them. What fire, what enthu&s;ia&s;m did &s;he find in Lindorf's expre&s;&s;ion of his pa&s;&s;ion for Loui&s;a, compared to the feelings &s;he had ob&s;erved when in company with her&s;elf! She was tempted to believe that the latter were little more than the re&s;ult of tranquil friend&s;hip. As to the young Ma|tilda&mdash;how happy was &s;he, who dared love Lindorf and own her pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;Ay&punc; but how much to be pitied; not to be beloved again! Charming Matilda! Generous Wal|&s;tein! Ye merit not ingratitude from others!</P>
<P>Caroline well recollected, that during the week pre|ceding her marriage, the Count had mentioned his &s;i&s;ter, and the hope that Caroline and &s;he would become friends! but, as &s;he was then wholly ab&s;orbed in meditating on the means of &s;eparation, &s;he had paid little attention to his di&s;cour&s;e. But ah! how bitter was the remembrance of having injured this Matilda, this &s;i&s;ter; injured her be|yond reparation; robbed her of a heart over which her claims were &s;o numerous, and &s;o legitimate! It was true &s;he did not &s;eem &s;ufficiently to know the value of this heart, thought Caroline, as &s;he again peru&s;ed the letter of the Count to Lindorf; and though the apparent want of &s;en&s;ibility in Matilda was in every re&s;pect a &s;ubject of con&s;olation to Caroline, yet could &s;he &s;carcely pardon her.</P>
<P>Deep in thought, on the many and &s;trange events &s;he ju&s;t had read, &s;at Caroline, and perceived not that it was noon, when a &s;ervant came from the Barone&s;s to &s;eek her. She ha&s;tily gathered up the papers that were &s;pread open around her, and locked them up in her bureau; but, as &s;he was going, &s;he perceived the box, containing the por|trait,
<PB N="142" REF="034126_0141_0FFA91B43215BB48">
&s;till on the table; this &s;he &s;lipped into her pocket, and ran to the Barone&s;s.</P>
<P>Caroline found her with a note &s;he had received from Lindorf, which &s;he could not read. Here, my dear, &s;aid the Canone&s;s, as &s;he entered, open this, and let me hear what our dear young Gentleman &s;ays, whom we have not &s;een for the&s;e two days; we &s;hall learn why he is ab&s;ent; I cannot tell thee how much I mi&s;s him. The melan|choly Caroline, expecting what the contents would be, &s;ighed, rai&s;ed her eyes to Heaven, and took the note. It contained compliments to the ladies; informed them, he, Lindorf, was forced to depart, immediately, on very e&s;|&s;ential and pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s; could not have the honour of &s;eeing them again; a&s;&s;ured them, however, he never could forget them, and earne&s;tly hoped a continuance of their e&s;teem and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Yes certainly, Caroline, knew, before &s;he read the con|tents of this note; it was no &s;urpri&s;e to her; yet was &s;he &s;o affected as &s;carcely to be able to pronounce a word. The conviction &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him no more, that all inter|cour&s;e between them was over, the cold and &s;tudied con|tra&s;t of this billet, compared to the manu&s;cript &s;he ju&s;t had read, the words e&s;teem and friend&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p, traced by the &s;ame hand, that &s;o lately had painted, with &s;uch enthu&s;i|a&s;m, the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul, the con&s;traint &s;he was under by the pre&s;ence of the Barone&s;s, all con&s;pired to render her &s;ituation almo&s;t in&s;upportable. Might one ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e her di&s;tre&s;s could &s;uffer augmentation?&mdash; Scarcely had &s;he fini&s;hed the note, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing her &s;obbs, tho' the tears ran ince&s;&s;antly down her cheeks, when tak|ing her handkerchief out of her pocket, the box, which &s;he had ju&s;t put in it, and which was then far from her thoughts, fell at her feet, and, laying open on the ground, pre&s;ented that form, and tho&s;e features which &s;he had be|fore feared to look on.

farewell billet of Lindorf, and this his &s;o unexpected de|parture.</P>
<P>The di&s;order in her eyes was a cataract; which, daily increa&s;ing, had too far injured her &s;ight to &s;ee the picture. Caroline might &s;ay what &s;he plea&s;ed, and it was much more ea&s;y to avoid an explanation concerning that, than to an&s;wer the que&s;tions, &s;uppo&s;itions, and lamentations of the Barone&s;s on the departure of Lindorf, which were uncea&s;ing. It broke all her mea&s;ures, di&s;concerted all her projects, and ab&s;outely threw her into de&s;pair! Ca|roline, afflicted as &s;he her&s;elf was, yet was obliged to ex|hau&s;t her imagination to comfort her friend. The be&s;t mode, no doubt, would have been to have proved, by confe&s;&s;ing her marriage, how chimerical all the&s;e her projects were. Caroline, who, at la&s;t, perceived what her views had been, in encouraging the vi&s;its of Lindorf, wi&s;hed to make this confe&s;&s;ion; but it was now become &s;o painful, &s;o difficult, &s;he had not the power. How might &s;he &s;o much as pronounce the name of the Count! How relate his wrongs! I am the &s;ource of mi&s;ery to the mo&s;t virtuous of human beings, the mo&s;t &s;ublime, mo&s;t worthy of felicity; and then, when I ought to have held my&s;elf ble&s;t, beyond the lot of women, then did I yield to antipathy, the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable, the mo&s;t unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus rea&s;oned Caroline&punc; nor was this antipathy the only &s;en&s;ation for which &s;he had cau&s;e to blu&s;h. The name of Lindorf was as painful to pronounce as that of Wal&s;tein; &s;he re&s;olved, therefore, to wait the an&s;wer of her father, and the effect of time, ere &s;he &s;poke, and to &s;upport, as well as &s;he was able, the regret of the Ba|rone&s;s, for the ab&s;ence of Lindorf. In fact, &s;he regret|ted it too much her&s;elf not to find her heart in uni&s;on with that of her friend; and, however painful this con|tinual &s;ubject of conver&s;ation might &s;ometimes be, yet was &s;he &s;o intere&s;ted in it, that &s;he &s;eemed to li&s;ten as though it were fa&s;cination to her ears. She became &s;till more a&s;&s;iduous in her attentions to the Barone&s;s than be|fore, who, being deprived of &s;ight, had &s;till more need of her cares. She went no more to the pavilion; her books and trea&s;ures were, one after another, brought back to her apartment! though her mu&s;ical in&s;truments and painting uten&s;ils were the la&s;t. The mind mu&s;t be at ea&s;e before it can wholly devote it&s;elf to, and coolly
<PB N="144" REF="034126_0143_0FFA91B60BA1EF90">
con&s;ider any &s;ubject. Caroline, whenever alone, was con&s;tantly reading her manu&s;cript and letters, rumi|nating on the beauteous Loui&s;a, the young Matilda, and the Count; &s;itting lo&s;t in a multitude of unconnected ideas, which were u&s;ually &s;ucceeded by a flood of tears. She likewi&s;e, become &s;o familiar with the picture, that at la&s;t, &s;he was never ea&s;y but when looking at it, and never beheld it without emotion; nay, even not with|out plea&s;ure. Great God; would &s;he &s;ay with her eyes fixed on the features, if, to &s;o many virtues, a per&s;on &s;o noble and a countenance &s;o expre&s;&s;ive were added? what mortal might be worthy of him? If?&mdash;Why do I &s;ay if? Who at pre&s;ent is worthy of Wal&s;tein? Am I? Oh! no, no; the be&s;t of men de&s;erves the be&s;t of wo|men; de&s;erves a heart devoted to him, and him only!</P>

<HEAD>CAROLINE OF LICHTFIELD.</HEAD>
<P>LEAVE we, for a time, the lovely Caroline to reflect, weep over, and alternately read the manu&s;cript of Lindorf and the letters of Wal&s;tein; and let us &s;ee what became of the two friends. Indeed, the profound &s;oli|tude of Caroline, the monotony of her pre&s;ent life, and the &s;truggles of her heart, would but weary the reader. Not that it was dulne&s;s by which &s;he was tormented; no, it was a &s;tate of continual agitation; the lea&s;t noi&s;e &s;he heard made her whole frame tremble and her blood run cold. Her imagination, ince&s;&s;antly employed on Lin|dorf and the Count, per&s;uaded her that one of the two would arrive at Rindaw. What! might &s;he think that Lindorf, who had bani&s;hed him&s;elf for ever from her pre&s;ence, would return? No: when &s;he rea&s;oned with her&s;elf, read his manu&s;cript, and recollected the obliga|tions he was under to Wal&s;tein, &s;he would exclaim, with conviction, Never, never &s;hall I &s;ee him more. But love and imagination do not always rea&s;on; and, uncon&s;cious of it her&s;elf, perhaps &s;he thought, more than once, he would not have the fortitude to keep his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>She was deceived. At the farther part of Sile&s;ia, in his melancholy man&s;ion of Ronebourg, Lindorf re|pented of his involuntary crime with tears and groans, and thought the expiation of a life &s;carcely &s;ufficient a|tonement. Alas! how often was he tempted to termi|nate that life he no longer could con&s;ecrate to Caroline, and which had hitherto been &s;o fatal to the be&s;t of friends! But he knew them both too well not to be certain that &s;uch an act would for ever de&s;troy their happine&s;s and tranquillity. He read the Sorrows of Werter, but they produced a very different effect to what might have been expected. The de&s;pair of Charlotte, of Albert, the friend of Werter, were terrible; and, more generous than the latter, Lindorf would rather live and &s;uffer, than empoi|&s;en the felicity of tho&s;e he loved.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="034126_0146_0FFA91BBDB39E110">During the fir&s;t part of his re&s;idence at Ronebourg, life was become &s;o odious to him, and the pain of &s;up|porting it appeared &s;o great, that he thought thus, by en|during this pain, to make &s;ome reparation for his wrongs, which idea was his only con&s;olation. We mu&s;t likewi&s;e ob&s;erve if his pa&s;&s;ions were violent they were the le&s;s likely to be eternal. Notwith&s;tanding his &s;ubtle di&s;tinc|tion concerning the different &s;pecies of love, he had a|dored Loui&s;a; and, though he had not the &s;ame extreme pa&s;&s;ion for Matilda, yet, had &s;he certainly, began to make a con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion on his heart, when &s;he was car|ried off. We have &s;ince &s;een to what exce&s;s he loved Caroline; hope we then that time, or &s;ome other pa&s;|&s;ion, may cure him of this unfortunate love. His heart is too hone&s;t, his affection for Wal&s;tein too &s;incere, to make him endeavour to cheri&s;h &s;entiments he knows to be criminal.</P>
<P>He had been a reclu&s;e, more than a month, at Rone|bourg, and his cure was not very far advanced, when, one day, attempting a &s;econd time to write to the Count, without well knowing what to &s;ay, he beheld the Count him&s;elf, enter his chamber, and run into his arms. Sur|pri&s;ed, at his arrival from Peter&s;burg, not to find Lin|dorf at Berlin, and learning from the &s;ervants he had left there, he was gone to Ronebourg, where he was alone; Wal&s;tein, who dreaded &s;ome unexpected misfortune, waited only to pay his duty to the King and his good fa|ther-in-law, the High Chamberlain, and immediately de|parted to learn what might be the motives of this his &s;in|gular retreat, at the very moment he &s;uppo&s;ed him in the full enjoyment of happine&s;s. No &s;ooner were the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of &s;urpri&s;e, emotion, and joy over, than the Count began his interrogations. They were dictated by the fears and affections of friend&s;hip. "Tell me, in|&s;tantly, dear Lindorf," &s;aid he, "wherefore do I find you here, alone, melancholy, with &s;ome &s;ecret malady at your heart, which your countenance but too plainly be|trays? Unfold the cruel my&s;tery, my friend. What is become of the lady you loved? Why is &s;he not with you? Why not united to you? Wherefore is not my friend happy?"</P>
<P>The Count might have continued &s;peaking; for Lin|dorf, ignorant of his coming, unprepared to an&s;wer que&s;|tions &s;o terrible as the&s;e, kept a mournful &s;ilence. Wal|&s;tein
<PB N="5" REF="034126_0147_0FFA917B532FE938">
was &s;ilent al&s;o; but he pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Lindorf, while his countenance, expre&s;&s;ive of the feelings of his heart, &s;eemed to demand his confidence. At length, "What!" &s;aid he, "Lindorf, will you not tell me? Am I no longer your friend; the faithful guardian of your bo&s;om &s;ecrets, and have I not a right to read what pa&s;&s;es there?"</P>
<P>"Yes, yes," cried Lindorf, "you have every imagi|nable right over me; you are my friend, the be&s;t of friends, and never did I feel it more powerfully than at this moment, in which I am obliged to refu&s;e you what you a&s;k." The Count, amazed, fell back &s;ome paces. Lindorf continued, "Oh! my dear Wal&s;tein, recoil not from your unhappy friend, condemn him not too lightly. Silence is not my choice, but the effect of ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity; and, did you know, you mu&s;t approve my motives. Re&s;trained by honour, oaths, every thing mo&s;t &s;acred, I may not betray a &s;ecret which regards not me alone. A&s;k no more concerning this unfortunate affair, but pity him who is deprived of the melancholy re&s;ource of dividing his griefs."</P>
<P>The Count again went up to Lindorf, again took him by the hand, and his looks proved how much he was af|fected. "Re&s;trained by honour and oaths!" &s;aid he; "my que&s;tions, then, all are ended; too well, my&s;elf, I know how far a &s;ecret promi&s;e is obligatory, and I am an|&s;wered&mdash;Yet is the misfortune without a remedy? Have you no hope?"</P>
<P>"None, none," replied Lindorf, with vehemence, "I have forever lo&s;t her whom I adored; &s;he exi&s;ts no more"&mdash;Lindorf &s;topped; he was going to have added, <HI>for me,</HI> but was fearful of &s;aying too much, and the Count exclaimed, "Good God! Lindorf, exi&s;ts no more! What, has death deprived you of her? Ah! dear and unfortunate Lindorf, how infinitely do I pity you!"</P>
<P>Lindorf wi&s;hed to undeceive him, yet his fears again kept him &s;ilent; he dreaded le&s;t Wal&s;tein &s;hould divine the truth, and, on con&s;ideration, was not &s;orry he had thus mi&s;under&s;tood him. His &s;ilence, therefore, con|firmed this idea of death, and would de&s;troy every &s;uppo|&s;ition that might have alighted on Caroline, Wal&s;tein, however, had none: never had it entered his thoughts that his own wife was the woman &s;o much beloved, &s;o
<PB N="6" REF="034126_0148_0FFA91BD80BB1E58">
much regretted. He had been ab&s;ent from Pru&s;&s;ia, was equally ignorant of the &s;ituation of Rindaw, where he had never been, and of Ri&s;berg; nor did he even know that Lindorf had lived there, or there had formed the connec|tion &s;o fatal to his repo&s;e. He knew, likewi&s;e, Caroline was living, and well, and remained per&s;uaded that &s;ome tragical event had robbed Lindorf's mi&s;tre&s;s of life. The gloomy de&s;pair in which the latter remained, after this conver&s;ation, confirmed the idea. Wal&s;tein endeavoured to calm and con&s;ole him, and a&s;ked if he would not re|turn to Berlin.</P>
<P>"To Berlin!" cried Lindorf, with terror; "No, no, dear Wal&s;tein, never, never.&mdash;I mu&s;t quit this country; I mu&s;t travel for &s;ome years: oppo&s;e not a re&s;olution ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary and fixed. On your friend&s;hip I de|pend to obtain permi&s;&s;ion, and the conclu&s;ion of peace makes me hope it will not be difficult to obtain. Should the King refu&s;e, I mu&s;t re&s;ign my commi&s;&s;ion; I mu&s;t depart, I mu&s;t leave this country."</P>
<P>Ignorant of his real motives, the Count judged he had very urgent rea&s;ons for quitting Pru&s;&s;ia, and was the le&s;s ready to &s;earch for objections, becau&s;e he thought a few years travelling might remove his angui&s;h. He, therefore, promi&s;ed to obtain the leave he de&s;ired; and, a few mi|nutes after, added, "It is very po&s;&s;ible, dear Lindorf, I may go with you.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &mdash;"You Wal&s;tein?"&mdash;"Yes, I my friend; I, as well as you, perhaps, may have rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to quit my country. We will go together, and we &s;hall be le&s;s unhappy."</P>
<P>"Unhappy!" cried Lindorf, "may you, may the Count of Wal&s;tein &s;peak of unhappine&s;s!"</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand your &s;urpri&s;e," &s;aid the Count, drawing nearer, "but it is time it &s;hould end; time it is that I &s;hould reveal a &s;ecret I have too long kept hidden. Can I, Lindorf, blame you for my&s;terious conduct, when you &s;hall know that I have been married the&s;e &s;ix months?"</P>
<P>Lindorf affected not &s;urpri&s;e; it was impo&s;&s;ible, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion e&s;pecially, to feign what he did not feel; but his embarra&s;&s;ment, the red flu&s;hings of his countenance, and his real &s;en&s;ations, there &s;o marked, gave him the appearance of &s;urpri&s;e. The Count continued.</P>
<P>"Yes, my friend, I am united to the mo&s;t angelic of women; and yet am I far from being happy! I will re|late all my mournful &s;tory; at pre&s;ent it will be &s;ome
<PB N="7" REF="034126_0149_0FFA90F2942731E8">
con&s;olation, and may I bring that conviction home to you which I my&s;elf begin to experience; that in friend&s;hip, only, man ought to &s;eek felicity."</P>
<P>Then did the Count enter on a narrative, bitter to the &s;oul of Lindorf, which he had fore&s;een, and which, of all tortures, he mo&s;t had dreaded. The recital confirmed his misfortunes, his remor&s;e, and lacerated his heart. What mu&s;t be the impre&s;&s;ion, on that agitated heart, of the name of Caroline, repeated every in&s;tant; a name &s;o deeply engraven there, and of which he was obliged to di&s;&s;emble ignorance? Surely, if Lindorf had been guilty of invo|luntary wrongs, to this the mo&s;t worthy of men; what he now &s;uffered was &s;ufficient to expiate all his errors. The Count began his narrative far back; told Lindorf it was the King, who, knowing the rich inheritance of Caroline, fir&s;t projected this marriage, and had written to him con|cerning it while in Ru&s;&s;ia. "The motive," &s;aid Wal|&s;tein, "and even the will of my Sovereign, who was ve|ry warm on the &s;ubject, le&s;s influenced me than the age and the kind of education of the young lady."</P>
<P>"Caroline of Lichtfield, &s;till very young, having li|ved reclu&s;e in the country, and never &s;een any man who had made an impre&s;&s;ion on her heart, &s;eemed exactly the woman I had &s;o long de&s;ired. You know my &s;y&s;tem was founded on an ignorance of the world, and of love. I certainly &s;hall find means, &s;aid I, to allure and attach this young heart; if not by love, at lea&s;t, by friend&s;hip &s;o powerful, and gratitude &s;o tender, that they may well &s;upply the want of this pa&s;&s;ion. Fir&s;t appearances will be again&s;t me; but &s;ucceeding trials and better acquaint|ance will a&s;certain our mutual happine&s;s. Full of this dear, this flattering idea, I an&s;wered the King with rap|ture, a&s;&s;uring him I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf too happy, might I but obtain the hand of the young Barone&s;s of Lichtfield. His Maje&s;ty delayed not to reply that he had obtained the promi&s;e of the High Chamberlain, and commanded me to return, immediately, and conclude the marriage.</P>
<P>"I began my journey, but was obliged to remain at Dantzi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, ill of a violent fever, which brought me to the brink of the grave; while you, dear Lindorf, were then fulfilling the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;acred of duties to an expiring parent. It was two months before I was well enough to continue my journey. I arrived at Berlin, and had the di&s;appointment to find you were not there. I heard al&s;o,
<PB N="8" REF="034126_0150_0FFA91BF5F4EDCB0">
with anxiety, that my young bride had pa&s;&s;ed the two months of my illne&s;s at court. Ah! how many impedi|ments might the&s;e two months have thrown in the way of happine&s;s! How might they have deranged my whole plan! I &s;trove not to conceal my fears from my Sove|reign, who con&s;oled me with his u&s;ual goodne&s;s: He had often, him&s;elf, ob&s;erved Caroline, and had always found the &s;ame air of innocence and cheerful &s;prightline&s;s, which &s;hewed the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be at ea&s;e. "At leaving her retreat, I gave &s;ufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> intimation," added he, "of what my intentions were purpo&s;ely to keep all our young cour|tiers at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance; and, though your bride is an angelic young lady, not one of them have attempted to pay her the ea&s;t attention, more than politene&s;s requi|red; and Caroline her&s;elf, without di&s;tingui&s;hing one man above another, has &s;ought her own amu&s;ement only." The &s;ame evening I was introduced to the Baron of Lichtfield, my future father, and, on the morrow, to the lovely Caroline."</P>
<P>Here the Count related the manner of his fir&s;t vi&s;it, which we have before circum&s;tantially de&s;cribed; the a|ver&s;ion of Caroline, which &s;he could not di&s;&s;emble; and confe&s;&s;ed that, no doubt, it would then have been more ge|nerous, more delicate, to have abandoned his intents, and that he even had thought &s;o to have done; "but," added Wal&s;tein, "it is ea&s;y to delude one's &s;elf. Imagine, my friend, that this very flight, this emotion, &s;o natural, &s;o open, &s;o unrepre&s;&s;ed, which ought perhaps to have ter|rified, gave me, on the contrary, great plea&s;ure; and, on full reflection, made me more ardent to obtain her. In them I thought I beheld indubitable proof of that candour, that innocence of early youth, which I had feared le&s;t her re&s;idence at court might have tainted. Had &s;he been more artful &s;he would certainly have better concealed this fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation of terror, and I inwardly thanked her for flying me thus. The moment I beheld her, the moment &s;he entered, led by her father, her ingenuous open, and beautiful countenance, and the graces that were in every motion, and in all her form, made their full impre&s;&s;ion. She was exactly the per&s;on whom, had I the beauties of the world a&s;&s;embled, I &s;hould alone have &s;elected."</P>
<P>"If I did not ab&s;olutely believe that I no way contri|buted to the &s;udden fear and flight of Caroline, it was not the fault of the High Chamberlain. I li&s;tened, how|ever,
<PB N="9" REF="034126_0151_0FFA90F432198020">
with plea&s;ure, to his prote&s;tations; and particular|ly, when he declared, on his word and honour, &s;he had, that very morning, a&s;&s;ured him her heart was free, and that &s;he was very willing to be mine. "I have laid no con&s;traint on her," &s;aid he, and confirmed it with an oath; and to-morrow, if her health permit, &s;he her&s;elf will "tell you &s;o."</P>
<P>"Alas? my friend, how readily does the heart believe what it ardently de&s;ires! I departed, almo&s;t convinced; and the morrow, and the future morrows, confirmed the illu&s;ion. I ob&s;erved the young lady; &s;he appeared ex|ceedingly timid, but &s;hewed not the lea&s;t repugnance.&mdash; Our marriage was fixed, by the King, for that day week, and &s;he con&s;ented without a&s;king any delay; nay, once, when delay was mentioned, &s;he begged it might not take place. (The reader will no doubt here recollect the arti|fice of the High Chamberlain, and the fears of Caroline for her father's life.) I &s;hould have employed the inter|mediate time in endeavouring to gain her confidence and friend&s;hip; but, during the few vi&s;its I make, the Baron &s;uppo&s;ed etiquette required he &s;hould not leave us alone. (Here Wal&s;tein likewi&s;e mi&s;took the High Chamberlain's motives.) She &s;poke little; but that little had meaning, and was well timed, and di&s;covered a mind that made me more and more enraptured with her, till I imagined my|&s;elf the mo&s;t fortunate of men.</P>
<P>"The evening before the ceremony was to be per|formed, I thought, however, I perceived marks of grief on her lovely countenance. Her eyes were red, her heart &s;eemed heavy, and one might &s;ee &s;he endeavoured to &s;tifle her feelings. I was much affected at ob&s;erving this, and, &s;eizing the opportunity of a moment when we were un|ob&s;erved, I, tenderly approaching her, &s;aid, "Beauteous Caroline, am I any way the cau&s;e of grief to you? Is it in my power, by any means, to give you ea&s;e?" She tim|idly, looked down, and was &s;ilent. At la&s;t &s;he &s;oftly an|&s;wered, "An engagement for life will occa&s;ion fears; but I believe you, Sir, to be good and generous, and that hope cheers me: on you, alone, my happine&s;s will de|pend."</P>
<P>"I knew not how to interpret the manner in which &s;he &s;aid this, and was going to reply, but her father came up; &s;he then a&s;&s;umed her natural tone and manner, and &s;eemed no longer to dread the approaching moment.&mdash;
<PB N="10" REF="034126_0152_0FFA91C20ACBFE08">
How, then, was it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould divine her meaning; or pre&s;age the dreadful &s;troke that awaited me?"</P>
<P>The Count, then, relating all that had pa&s;&s;ed on the day of the marriage, took from his pocket-book the letter which Caroline had given him, and which has before been read. "Here, my friend," &s;aid he, to Lindorf, "take this; read, and &s;ee the dreadful rever&s;e; behold the fearful traits of the fallen thunderbolt."</P>
<P>Lindorf had occa&s;ion for all his fortitude. With a trembling had, and with vague and ab&s;ent eyes, he took and run over lines traced by her he adored, in language mo&s;t affecting, natural and eloquent. He would have &s;aid &s;omething to the Count, as he returned it, but could not articulate a word. He flung him&s;elf into the arms of Wal&s;tein, pre&s;&s;ed him to his bo&s;om, and a tear, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould no longer detain, fell down his cheek.</P>
<P>Had the Count had the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the truth, this exce&s;&s;ive emotion might well have given it confirmation; but none he had, for none he &s;ought; his heart was a &s;anctuary too holy for a gue&s;t &s;o vile, and he beheld noth|ing but &s;ympathetic &s;en&s;ibility, heightened, perhaps, by &s;ympathy of &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lindorf," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, when he was a little calm, "you feel too &s;trongly the di&s;tre&s;s of your friend; and I even fear I have uncon&s;ciou&s;ly torn the bandage from your own wound. Some explanation, &s;ome &s;troke equal|ly afflicting you may have &s;u&s;tained.&mdash;I &s;ee&mdash;I &s;ee I ought to have been &s;ilent, ought &s;till to have concealed this fa|tal &s;ecret; your own pangs are &s;ufficient, and I did you inju&s;tice when I &s;uppo&s;ed mine might afford you con&s;o|lation.

This proof of thy friend&s;hip, this too &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility of what my feelings are, penetrate me to the very heart."</P>
<P>"O Wal&s;tein, Wal&s;tein," exclaimed Lindorf; and, &s;inking under the oppre&s;&s;ive weight of remor&s;e, hid his face with both his hands. He was going in&s;tantly to have di&s;covered the real cau&s;e of this his emotion, but he re|membered Caroline, and the oath he had made never to reveal what might, to her, have con&s;equences &s;o fatal; this&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of duties, &s;uddenly was recollected, and this &s;topped him &s;hort.</P>
<P>The Count, &s;eeing him &s;o deeply affected, wi&s;hed to change the &s;ubject. His feelings, ever delicate, were
<PB N="11" REF="034126_0153_0FFA90F743018030">
ever aver&s;e to give others pain.&mdash;"Come, come, my friend," &s;aid he, "let us take a walk in your park, and we will &s;peak on the&s;e matters another time." Accord|ingly, they went out together, and the Count di&s;cour&s;ed on the country and the court he had &s;o lately left, and entered into the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and curious di&s;cu&s;&s;ions; for his genius, naturally penetrating and ob&s;erving, his rank, and the flattering di&s;tinctions paid him by the Em|pre&s;s, who highly re&s;pected him, gave him the power and the means of &s;eeing and of judging.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation, which Wal&s;tein prolonged, and gave all the animation to in his power, purpo&s;ely that Lin|dorf might recover him&s;elf, had the effect intended; he in&s;en&s;ibly became calm, and afterwards highly delighted. No per&s;on had the art of captivating the ear and under|&s;tanding like the Count of Wal&s;tein; his mild and per|&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, the tone of his voice, which &s;poke to the heart, and his happy choice of words, rendered his conver&s;ation inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;weet and agreeable: great knowledge, without pedantry or &s;eeming con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, happy expre&s;&s;ions, per&s;picuity, and connection in all he &s;aid, and that kind of hone&s;t in&s;inu|ation which adapts it&s;elf to, and draws forth, the powers of others, rendered him, indeed, a mo&s;t in&s;tructive com|panion. No per&s;on could be in his company without having learnt &s;omething, nor without being exceedingly well &s;atisfied with him&s;elf. Since his marriage, the Count had lo&s;t much of the gaiety of early youth, which even his accident had not before robbed him of; but it was re|placed by a &s;trong imagination, an energetic fire, which appertained to him only, and which could only by hearing him be perfectly conceived. While he &s;poke no auditor remembered his per&s;on, and, more than once, at Peter&s;|burg, it was his fault that the ladies did not entirely for|get it. Let us add, now we are on the &s;ubject, that his per&s;on, &s;o ill-treated, was &s;o much improved that Lindorf him&s;elf was &s;urpri&s;ed, and Caroline, who had &s;een him after a two months illne&s;s, would have been &s;till more &s;o, had &s;he beheld him now. His hair, which had come off after the fever, had grown again in abundance, was of a fine colour, and well di&s;po&s;ed. The &s;car on his face, greatly filled up, was &s;carcely apparent; he was no longer meagre, but had an appearance of youth and health, very different from the yellow and livid tints his malady had
<PB N="12" REF="034126_0154_0FFA91C5B9837708">
left, at the time of his marriage&punc; a bit of green &s;ilk, and a ribband, properly di&s;po&s;ed, removed that di&s;gu&s;t which the lo&s;s of an eye might, at fir&s;t fight, have cau&s;ed; and a little attention to him&s;elf had con&s;iderably corrected his habit of &s;tooping; &s;o that his &s;hape &s;eemed remarkable only by an ea&s;y and negligent attitude, much preferable to upright formality. It is true, he &s;till limped, but he was oftener &s;eated than walking; hence we may well imagine, that with exceeding fine teeth, and infinite ex|pre&s;&s;ion in his countenance, the Count of Wal&s;tein, then little above thirty, was not much an object of aver&s;ion. Had he been the &s;ame &s;ome months &s;ooner, Caroline would not have fled, her letter would not have been written, nor would this hi&s;tory have exi&s;ted. Every thing there|fore is right; let us return to our two friends.</P>
<P>Their walk continued till du&s;k, and Lindorf, highly plea&s;ed with the company of his friend, and fa&s;cinated by his conver&s;ation, pre&s;ently recovered him&s;elf perfectly. Impatient to know what were the re&s;olutions of Wal&s;tein re&s;pecting Caroline, he intreated him to fini&s;h his hi&s;tory. "It is fini&s;hed," an&s;wered the Count; "things remain ju&s;t as they were. You know me too well, dear Lindorf, to imagine I &s;hould refu&s;e a reque&s;t made in terms &s;o &s;trong, &s;o affecting, and even &s;o rea&s;onable, as was that of Caroline. I obtained, but not without &s;ome trouble, permi&s;&s;ion for her to return and live at Rindaw, with the friend by whom &s;he had been educated. The King, not very well plea&s;ed, I &s;uppo&s;e, that a match of his making &s;hould have this kind of conclu&s;ion, exacted the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy."&mdash;</P>
<P>"But ought not I to have been an exception?" &s;aid Lindorf, &s;uddenly interrupting the Count&mdash;"Have I not cau&s;e, my friend, to reproach you for this &s;ecrecy? What! conceal the mo&s;t intere&s;ting event of your whole life from me!"</P>
<P>"I own it was wrong, dear Lindorf, and often have I reproached my&s;elf; but the King had commanded, and both my duties and obligations have given me the habit of paying the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention to his orders: yet, had we met, I &s;hould certainly have told you; but the fear of a letter mi&s;carrying, and the conviction that my di&s;tre&s;s would have grieved you, were additional mo|tives to &s;ecrecy; and, in fact, my friend, by your pre&s;ent feelings, I find it is happy you were not acquainted with it &s;ooner."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="034126_0155_0FFA90FAFA0A0C28">Lindorf made no reply, though he felt the exact contra|ry mo&s;t forcibly; but he did not expect what was coming.</P>
<P>"Yes, my friend," added the Count, &s;miling, "you have youth and &s;en&s;ibility, and the Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein is an angel; you would have a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her, nay, I my&s;elf &s;hould have reque&s;ted you &s;o to do; you have &s;ince been in love, but your heart, then, was free, and might have been put to trial &s;o &s;evere that I cannot but be happy to think you have e&s;caped it. I own your &s;ufferings from love may be the &s;ame; but what, Lindorf, would have been the exce&s;s of that wretchedne&s;s, had the object of that love been the wife of your friend? Nay even Caroline her&s;elf would have been too much expo&s;ed to danger. I own my dear Lindorf," &s;aid Wal&s;tein, tap|ping him on the &s;houlder, "though I love you as a friend, I &s;hould fear you as a rival."</P>
<P>Poor Lindorf!&mdash;Happily it was twilight, and in a dark room; nay, perhaps, Lindorf had cho&s;en this &s;ituation and hour, purpo&s;ely, to renew the conver&s;ation. As &s;oon as he could recover his &s;peech, "I hope," &s;aid he "Wal|&s;tein does not think, cannot imagine, I ever might be his rival. I hope he will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that the title of his wife would be pledge &s;ufficient for my faith."</P>
<P>"Yes, if any faith might be kept with youth, grace, wit, and beauty," replied the Count. "But do not un|der&s;tand that &s;eriou&s;ly, dear Lindorf, which is not &s;eri|ou&s;ly meant; and which I &s;hould not have &s;aid, had there really been any danger.&mdash;At pre&s;ent you are but too much out of the power of love; be&s;ides, you are not likely to &s;ee the Counte&s;s; nay, perhaps, even I my&s;elf."&mdash;</P>
<P>"You your&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"Dear Lindorf, I know not how to act. Perhaps the impediments I have found m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y heighten &s;en&s;ations which a week's acquaintance ought not to have rendered ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y pa&s;&s;ionate; yet do they uncea&s;ingly a&s;&s;ault me. I more han ever feel my happine&s;s depends on living with Ca|roline, for Caroline, and by Caroline to be beloved, as much as a man like me may be beloved; yet never had I le&s;s hope of attaining the&s;e my &s;o ardent de&s;ires."</P>
<P>Lindorf li&s;tened with downca&s;t eyes. "She &s;till re|mains at Rindaw," added the Count, "which, &s;ince our &s;eparation, &s;he has never left; there living in a mo&s;t pro|found
<PB N="14" REF="034126_0156_0FFA91C86F499B28">
retreat, un&s;eeing and un&s;een, and debarred of all the plea&s;ures &s;he has every right to enjoy, and which her &s;hort &s;tay at court may, mo&s;t probably, have taught her to regret. Indeed, I have been told &s;he &s;eemed exceed|ingly fond of dancing; yet, might it be believed, all the&s;e plea&s;ures, the&s;e wi&s;hes &s;o natural at &s;ixteen, have been le&s;s powerful with her than the dreadful antipathy &s;he has conceived to me! This has given her force and fortitude incredible, and Caroline, with plea&s;ure, buries her youth and her charms in &s;olitude, to avoid living with a hu&s;|band &s;he hates!"</P>
<P>The generous&punc; the philo&s;ophic, the capacious heart of Wal&s;tein him&s;elf, &s;carcely, could contain its &s;orrows. While thus he &s;poke the deep and lengthened &s;igh heav|ed in his bo&s;om, and &s;ilently e&s;caped, while the tear was with difficulty detained and repelled.</P>
<P>"Have you heard of her &s;ince your return?" &s;aid Lindorf, in a low voice. "Are you certain &s;he per&s;i&s;ts in this unju&s;t &s;eparation?"</P>
<P>"Too certain," replied the Count, &s;eeking among the papers of his pocket-book. "Here is a letter from her to her father; he has lately received, and &s;ent it inclo&s;ed to me. You there will find &s;he declares her determina|tion to continue at Rindaw, and <HI>that her heart and her rea&s;on &s;till revolt at the ties &s;he has formed.</HI>"</P>
<P>Lindorf took the letter, read it as be had read the pre|ceding one; but remarked the date, &s;aw it had been writ|ten the very day on which he wrote the manu&s;cript, &s;igh|ed with bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit, and gave it back.</P>
<P>"The High Chamberlain," continued the Count, "has &s;aid, in his letter, that he had written &s;uch an an&s;wer as became him. The phra&s;e made me tremble; for his an|&s;wer, no doubt, was har&s;h and de&s;potic. Caroline, per|haps at this in&s;tant, drowned in tears, accu&s;es me anew of tyranny, and her hatred increa&s;es. My only happi|ne&s;s is, that this her hatred is not cau&s;ed by a pa&s;&s;ion for any other man.&mdash;Oh, Lindorf! &s;peak, aid, guide me; tell me how I ought to act in a &s;ituation &s;o delicate; from you I hope &s;alutary advice."&mdash;"Advice," &s;aid Lindorf, he&s;itating; "Wal&s;tein ought to take advice only of his own heart."&mdash;"I under&s;tand thee, my friend," &s;aid the Count, "and my heart, already, has dictated what it be|comes me to do."</P>
<P>What this was we &s;hall know hereafter; at pre&s;ent,
<PB N="15" REF="034126_0157_0FFA90FDA6553798">
leave we Lindorf to breathe, who had &s;ufficiently &s;uffer|ed during this painful conver&s;ation; leave we the Count to recover from the fatigues of his journey, and let us re|turn to Caroline.</P>
<P>The terrible an&s;wer of her father &s;he had received. Not only did he permit, but he commanded her to inform the Canone&s;s of her marriage; and prepare, immediately, to quit her and return to inhabit Wal&s;tein hou&s;e. "Too long," &s;aid he, "has this obliging hu&s;band allowed you to indulge a whim which his ab&s;ence only could make me tolerate; 'tis time it &s;hould end. The Count is come back, and does not chu&s;e to be deprived of his wife; he claims his rights, and, for my part, be certain you &s;hall for ever remain deprived of tho&s;e you have to my affec|tion, and likewi&s;e to my wealth, if you make the lea&s;t difficulty about returning. Expect no one to &s;upport you: I &s;peak in the name of a King, a Hu&s;band, and a Father equally angered by your long and ob&s;tinate di&s;obedience."</P>
<P>This was not true; the High Chamberlain acted on his own authority, and had neither received the command or the advice of any per&s;on for this fulminating letter; but he wi&s;hed to try if he might not obtain from terror, an effect which kindne&s;s, rea&s;on and retirement had not pro|duced. He was, be&s;ide, outrageous at this unfore&s;een per&s;everance of his daughter. A witne&s;s of the honours the Count received at returning from his emba&s;&s;y of the friend&s;hip the King had &s;o openly te&s;tified for him, and of the high and unrivalled favour he enjoyed, he impa|tiently burned to proclaim Wal&s;tein his &s;on, and partici|pate his glory. It was during a &s;it of this counteracted pa&s;&s;ion that he had written to his daughter; but Caroline, not &s;u&s;pecting it was po&s;&s;ible to alter or di&s;gui&s;e the truth, under&s;tood all he wrote litterally: the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of the King afflicted, and that of her &s;pou&s;e, e&s;pecially, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw not the generous Wal&s;tein, whom the manu&s;cript and letters of Lindorf had &s;hewn her in this tyranny; and whom, from being obliged to admire, &s;he began a little to love. But this &s;en&s;ation gave place to fear and di&s;like, the moment &s;he thought it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould abu&s;e his power.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, while again &s;he read his letters to Lindorf, and opened the box to look at his picture, which &s;he as &s;uddenly &s;hut again in di&s;plea&s;ure, "alas! his cha|racter is changed as much as his per&s;on. If he be already
<PB N="16" REF="034126_0158_0FFA91CB13EB22E8">
&s;o much irritated at this my re&s;i&s;tance, what will he be|come when he &s;hall learn the fatal &s;ecret of my heart, and that it has yielded wholly to his friend? Of this he can|not long remain ignorant, nor can he but know I love when he &s;hall be told I am acquainted with Lindorf."</P>
<P>De&s;pair redoubled at the thought. The &s;uppo&s;ition of living with a hu&s;band already prejudiced again&s;t her, per|haps jealous, and undoubtedly de&s;potic, &s;ince he had commanded her to return, was revolting. She no longer felt her&s;elf obliged to his conde&s;cen&s;ion for &s;uffering her to depart, and con&s;enting that &s;he &s;hould remain at Rin|daw all the time he was ab&s;ent; "He was no doubt glad I might there remain &s;hut up while he was at Peter&s;|burg; and proves, but too incontrovertibly, delicacy and mild complai&s;ance were not his motives.&mdash;Ah! Lindorf, friend&s;hip deceives you; the Count of Wal&s;tein po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not tho&s;e virtues you imagine."</P>
<P>To all this angui&s;h was added that of having to relate her &s;tory to the Canone&s;s. As often as &s;he endeavoured to &s;peak expre&s;&s;ion expired on her lips; never could &s;he determine &s;o to afflict that tender and unfortunate friend, &s;o at once to excite her anger and her grief, by informing her of the &s;ecret &s;he &s;o long had kept from her, and of the approaching departure of her dear pupil. The lo&s;s of her &s;ight had rendered the company of Caroline her &s;ole con&s;olation; and often did &s;he repeat that the moment &s;he was deprived of that would be the moment of her death; wherefore the idea of being obliged to quit her, added in|crea&s;e of pangs to the affectionate Caroline; nor could &s;he re&s;olve to plunge the poignard to her heart by &s;peak|ing of this dreadful &s;eparation, though &s;he thought it in|evitable. Yet did &s;he hope it might for a time, be defer|red. Her fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h &mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad fixed no day; he only had command|ed her to hold her&s;elf ready again&s;t he &s;hould come to take her away; accompanied, no doubt, by Wal&s;tein, her formidable hu&s;band.</P>
<P>To them &s;he left the office of informing the Canone&s;s, and daily waited their coming, in trances of de&s;pair; ha|ving no other hope but that of dying in the arms of her dear Mamma, with grief of being thus torn from her. In this inquietude, this continual agitation was &s;he, which con&s;iderably affected her health, when &s;he one day recei|ved a letter. The hand writing and the arms on the &s;eal were in&s;tantly recollected, and cau&s;ed an emotion, a con|traction
<PB N="17" REF="034126_0159_0FFA90FF49BAB518">
of the heart, which &s;carcely can be imagined. It was from the Count him&s;elf. She trembled as &s;he open|ed it; and was near fainting when &s;he &s;aw at the top, it was dated from the ca&s;tle of Ronebourg, the man&s;ion of Lindorf.&mdash;"Merciful God! He is with Lindorf!"&mdash; Caroline was obliged to pau&s;e awhile, and collect all her fortitude, ere &s;he could read what follows.</P>

To you, Madam, I leave the choice of the name you &s;hall bear, if mine be odious, if you &s;till would wi&s;h the world &s;hould call you Caroline of Lichtfield, and if you would rather re&s;ide with your father, I ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ea&s;ily obtain permi&s;|&s;ion from him, and from the Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that your marriage &s;hall &s;till remain a &s;ecret.

I will take care to give a plau&s;ible pretext for my travelling and ab&s;ence; which perhaps, may be very, very long; but the real motives of which they never &s;hall know.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The letter was ended; but what were the &s;en&s;ations of Caroline! Surpri&s;e, admiration, remor&s;e, affection? Who can an&s;wer? All! all mingled and together confounded. She her&s;elf knew not what! Long &s;he remained motion|le&s;s, her eyes rivetted on that paper which had &s;o entire|ly rever&s;ed all her opinions, and the contents of which were &s;o unexpected. Recovering from this kind of an|nihilation, her fir&s;t impul&s;e was to ri&s;e, open her bureau, a&s;&s;emble all the papers Lindorf had left, run to the cham|ber of her dear Mamma, and there bring her acquainted with this wonderful man! There inform her of the ties by which they were united, and &s;eek, in her friend&s;hip, that aid of which her heart at pre&s;ent &s;tood &s;o much in need! This hu&s;band who &s;o lately had been an object of &s;uch dread, a&s;&s;umed a form &s;o wholly different, di&s;played a mind &s;o congenial with her own, that &s;he now could gladly have cla&s;ped him to her bo&s;om. Her fetters, &s;o heavy half an hour ago, now &s;carcely fetters &s;eemed.&mdash; "Ah! Wal&s;tein," &s;aid &s;he, "generous Wal&s;tein; No; thou &s;halt not go; thou &s;halt not make thy&s;elf my victim!"</P>
<P>She &s;topped &s;hort, fearing to engage her&s;elf too far. Her affections were &s;truggling; her mind was &s;till op|pre&s;&s;ed, but by idea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> le&s;s afflicting. When &s;he came to her friend &s;he had not the pain &s;he before felt in pre|paring the mind of the Barone&s;s for the &s;ecret &s;he was about to di&s;clo&s;e; though this preparation was exceeding|ly nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o infinitely far was &s;he from imagining what
<PB N="20" REF="034126_0162_0FFA6044D8FFFA88">
&s;he was about to be told.&mdash;Caroline, her dear Caroline, &s;o long married, and &s;he never to &s;u&s;pect it! This was &s;o &s;ingular an incident, &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing and &s;o little fore&s;een, that all the tragedies, comedies, novels, and romances &s;he had ever read, afforded not one more &s;trange, more a&s;to|ni&s;hing.</P>
<P>After various preparatives, therefore, and many tender care&s;&s;es, her pupil, at la&s;t, explained all the&s;e &s;eeming my&s;teries in, as well as the rea&s;ons for, her conduct.&mdash; When the good Canone&s;s had exhau&s;ted her &s;urpri&s;e, an|ger, and reproach; after &s;he had, by turns, been vexed and affected; after &s;he had plentifully wept and murmur|ed; after &s;he had a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times repeat|ed, it was abominably mon&s;trous they &s;hould be afraid of tru&s;ting her with the &s;ecret, and &s;till more mon&s;trous that they had &s;acrificed her poor girl; Caroline begged for, and obtained, half an hour's &s;ilent hearing. This &s;he em|ployed to recapitulate every circum&s;tance that had pa&s;&s;ed with Lindorf; this was the mo&s;t painful part of her ta&s;k, but now &s;he was permitted to tell, &s;he was re&s;olved to have no re&s;erve, nothing concealed from her friend.</P>
<P>"No, dear Mamma," &s;aid &s;he, affectionately, "your Caroline will have no more &s;ecrets for you; &s;he has &s;uf|fered too much already by tho&s;e &s;he was obliged to keep. Only for the&s;e few days have I had the liberty to &s;peak, and but for a few moments the fortitude; for this I am indebted to the Count. Yes, to him do I owe the hap|pine&s;s of daring to open my heart to you, and to have nothing painful to relate. Oh! Madam, when you &s;hall know what an angel he is, and how great have been my wrongs, you will not any longer pity your Caroline; &s;he a&s;ks only a little indulgence, and the patience to hear a long recital; for nothing, hereafter, Mamma, will I hide from you; no, nothing, nothing."</P>
<P>Caroline kept her word, nor did &s;he &s;urpri&s;e the Cano|ne&s;s by confe&s;&s;ing her love for Lindorf.&mdash;"Alas! I &s;aw it well enough," replied the Canone&s;s; "and I, poor &s;illy woman that I was, congratulated my&s;elf on the di&s;covery. I intended&mdash;Yes, yes, I had a great many intentions; had contrived every thing. See what an error your fine &s;e|cret has led me into! Am not I acquainted with the ef|fects of the pa&s;&s;ions! Amiable people meet, and, becau&s;e they are amiable, fall in love. We are formed for love, and to love eternally; for fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions are never effaced."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="034126_0163_0FFA9104C69B6030">"Ah!" exclaimed Caroline, with enthu&s;ia&s;m, "I hope, Mamma, you are mi&s;taken; I hope they &s;ometimes are effaced; at lea&s;t it &s;hall not be my fault if they are not. No; it &s;hall not."&mdash;"Fault, poor girl, it would be no fault of thine; but thy &s;truggles will all be in vain.&mdash; What! &s;urely I know! The more you combat love the more it increa&s;es. For how is it po&s;&s;ible to cea&s;e to love?"</P>
<P>"Very po&s;&s;ible, Mamma, when love renders us guilty. Oh! dear, dear Madam, you know not, cannot imagine, how guilty we both were; I for offending the be&s;t of hu&s;|bands, and Lindorf a friend &s;uch as man never had before."</P>
<P>Caroline then began to read her manu&s;cript, and thought &s;he never could have got through it, &s;o ince&s;&s;antly was &s;he interrupted by the exclamations of the good kind hearted Canone&s;s. At fir&s;t &s;he was in raptures with the brave General, who died to &s;ave the life of his King.&mdash; Then too did the young Count intere&s;t her, but &s;till her dear Lindorf lay at her heart. "How charmingly he writes," &s;aid &s;he; "how tender, how feeling his &s;tyle! Ah! how &s;orry am I! He would have been the hu&s;band for my Caroline." When however they came to Loui&s;a, her friend&s;hip &s;uffered con&s;iderable abatement.&mdash;"What prai&s;es does he be&s;tow on this girl! Is it for a gentleman and a Baron to notice whether or not a village la&s;s be pretty!"&mdash;But when &s;he beheld him &s;eriou&s;ly in love with, and de&s;irous of marrying her, &s;he could contain her anger no longer; nay, &s;o great was it that Caroline felt &s;omewhat &s;orry for having given it birth.&mdash;"Speak not a word in his defence," &s;aid the Canone&s;s. "Oh! how has he deceived me! Love a pea&s;ant's daughter! Intend to marry her! And, after that dare to pay his addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Lichtfield! 'Tis abominable! and thou oughte&s;t to think thy&s;elf mo&s;t happy for having been married, and not made the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of this his Loui&s;a. The &s;econd love, truly; and the fir&s;t for a poor villager! How have I been deceived in that man; and who hereafter may one confide in!"</P>
<P>Caroline, more affected than humbled at having been the object of a &s;econd pa&s;&s;ion, made no reply, but &s;ighed, and again continued to read, as &s;oon as the petulant Ba|rone&s;s would permit. In proportion as the fickle Lin|dorf &s;unk in here e&s;teem, did Wal&s;tein ri&s;e; and he &s;oon became her entire hero. His dignity, energy, and noble mind enchanted her. "You are too happy," repeated
<PB N="22" REF="034126_0164_0FFA91D3174B8FE0">
&s;he to Caroline, "to be the wife of &s;uch a man! What tell you me of his not being hand&s;ome? You are wrong; he is as hand&s;ome as an Angel, and his &s;entiments are the &s;entiments of a God!&mdash;How did he &s;peak to that di|minutive Lindorf? You do not find him in love with a village girl."</P>
<P>Yet &s;he knew not what to think, for a while, of his behaviour to Loui&s;a; but, afterwards, when &s;he came to the dreadful cata&s;trophe, when &s;he &s;aw the Count wound|ed, disfigured, and heard to what exce&s;s he had carried his genero&s;ity and friend&s;hip, &s;he was &s;uffocated, ab&s;o|lutely unable to re&s;train her&s;elf, her tears, or her excla|mations. Lindorf was a mon&s;ter and Wal&s;tein a deity, before whom mere mortals ought to fall pro&s;trate! Her enthu&s;ia&s;m increa&s;ed in every line, and his letters to his friend made it a&s;toni&s;hment! She prote&s;ted Heaven had created this man, purpo&s;ely for her Caroline: his &s;oul was not of this age, he was a Cyrus, an Oroondates, every thing &s;he had heard, read, or could imagine, of &s;ublime. "As to your Lindorf, you &s;ee he merely re&s;embles the pre&s;ent race; you will find he &s;till loves Matilda; nay, that he could love a dozen at a time. To be &s;ure, as to this Lady, &s;he is a Counte&s;s, but never will I forgive him his Loui&s;a. I make no doubt but he will return to Matilda now; but I &s;incerely hope &s;he will act towards him as I did to the High Chamberlain, when he came to offer me his hand after the death of thy mother, and that &s;he, like me, with noble pride, will give her refu&s;al."</P>
<P>"I hope not," cried Caroline, and the hope came from the bottom of her heart; even &s;he her&s;elf was &s;urpri&s;ed at it; never before had &s;he truly felt &s;o anxious a de&s;ire that Lindorf again might love Matilda, and that to her he might henceforth be no more than a brother. Wal&s;tein, indeed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;oul &s;o &s;uperior, &s;o tran&s;cendant, one to whom it was &s;o honourable to be allied, that Caroline actually felt her attachment for Lindorf was not, at this moment, the &s;tronge&s;t attachment of her heart. It was a moment of enthu&s;ia&s;m, we own; and which the &s;trong and &s;ympathetic feelings of her friend had increa&s;ed; but we may leave the ta&s;k of &s;till increa&s;ing them to the care of this friend.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to the la&s;t letter, which Caroline had received that day; the letter in which the Count &s;poke of her, thought of her, and confirmed her in the hope of
<PB N="23" REF="034126_0165_0FFA9108732A1560">
for ever living with her dear Caroline; when &s;he heard the phra&s;e, <HI>You will prevail on your tender and re&s;pectable friend, whom you wi&s;h, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d whom, indeed, it is your duty, never to for&s;ake, to come and live with you;</HI> &s;he no longer could moderate her tran&s;ports; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed Caroline again and again; called her, her dear friend, her lovely Count|e&s;s, and while the tears trickled down her cheeks, added, "We mu&s;t not let this angel depart, mu&s;t we, my child? Mu&s;t he go?"&mdash;"No certainly," replied Caroline; "I &s;hould be the mo&s;t ungrateful of women, were I to give my con&s;ent. Permit me to go and an&s;wer his letter, im|mediately; for the courier returns this evening."</P>
<P>Caroline left the good Barone&s;s all amazement, all rap|ture at what &s;he had heard; and with matter &s;ufficient to employ her thoughts without dread of dulne&s;s from being alone. The very idea of writing to the Count would have petrified Caroline, had it been propo&s;ed the even|ing before; while, at pre&s;ent, nothing &s;eemed more ea&s;y; her heart overflowing with gratitude and admiration could not have found an employment more accordant to its feelings; her rapid imagination dictated a thou&s;and things, and as &s;he entered her apartment, &s;he ran to her bu|reau. The fir&s;t object which pre&s;ented it&s;elf, as &s;he open|ed it, was the box containing the miniature picture of her hu&s;band. During her anger again&s;t him, to which the letter of her father had given birth, &s;he had concealed the box under the manu&s;cript which &s;he had that day remo|ved; in&s;tantly &s;he took it up, opened it, and fixed her eyes on tho&s;e fine features, that countenance &s;o noble and &s;o mild; and, as &s;he looked, felt a &s;en&s;ation which never till then had &s;he known. She forgot how much his per|&s;on was altered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">magined &s;he really beheld him, and was a&s;toni&s;hed how &s;he could have refu&s;ed her heart to the original of &s;uch a portrait. In&s;en&s;ibly did &s;he become affected, tears ro&s;e in her eyes, and with great emotion &s;he pre&s;&s;ed the picture to her lips.</P>
<P>Thus was &s;he in a mo&s;t excellent di&s;po&s;ition to an&s;wer Wal&s;tein; and, had &s;he written at that moment, the an|&s;wer would have been much more tender than he had dared to hope; but de&s;irous of confirming the&s;e her new &s;en&s;a|tions, which were the more plea&s;ing becau&s;e unaccompa|nied by remor&s;e, &s;he would read once more the letter from the Count. Ah! what ungrateful, what cruel idea then &s;uddenly entered her mind! It was that he, Wal|&s;tein,
<PB N="24" REF="034126_0166_0FFA91D5D8E86B48">
required this long, and, perhaps, everla&s;ting &s;epa|ration; he who propo&s;ed it, he who &s;eemed to in&s;i&s;t on its taking place!&mdash;His rea&s;ons were evident; he dread|ed living with a capricious, unju&s;t woman, who &s;uffered her&s;elf to have been &s;o ea&s;ily prejudiced; a child, ob&s;ti|nate, wilful, and void of rea&s;on; for thus, &s;aid Caroline, I mu&s;t appear to him; thus have I de&s;erved to be thought.</P>
<P>The phra&s;e in which he mentioned Lindorf, and which before &s;he had &s;carcely remarked, made al&s;o an unfortu|nate impre&s;&s;ion. "A friend whom an unhappy pa&s;&s;ion obliges to travel. I am determined to go with him."&mdash; How might the Count be ignorant of the object of this pa&s;&s;ion? Though Lindorf &s;hould not have told him, he mu&s;t, him&s;elf, have divined it; it was impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e. Be&s;ide, does he not &s;ay he is "determined to go with him?"</P>
<P>We are alike ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e what mo&s;t we wi&s;h or mo&s;t we fear &s;hould happen, has happened. And now is the active imagination of Caroline bu&s;ily labouring to paint every object black; and now, the more &s;he reads that letter, which at fir&s;t appeared &s;o tender, &s;o flattering, the more is &s;he convinced that the genero&s;ity of Wal|&s;tein, only, has dictated his expre&s;&s;ions, and that he ar|dently de&s;ires to live from her. For what probability was there, were not &s;uch his motives, that he would thus re|nounce his country, his employments, the Court, and the favour and friend&s;hip of his Sovereign? Had he had the lea&s;t wi&s;h to live with her, would he not have made the attempt? Would he not fir&s;t have &s;een her and en|deavoured to find what her pre&s;ent thoughts were, before he would make &s;o cruel a determination?&mdash;"Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, mournfully laying down the letter and the picture, "I had a momentary dream of almo&s;t happine&s;s, but it is vani&s;hed. Happine&s;s is not for me!&mdash;How dearly would he have loved me! But how may I now hope that &s;hould ever happen, &s;ince he wi&s;hes not to know me, &s;ince he de&s;pi&s;es, nay, perhaps hates me! And, yet, how great is his genero&s;ity, his benevolence! But does it be|come me to abu&s;e this genero&s;ity, and after having &s;inned again&s;t him &s;o unpardonably, mu&s;t I likewi&s;e bani&s;h him his country? No, never; I am determined how to act; I will here pa&s;s my life far from him, far from the world; he &s;hall be at liberty to remain at court, to benefit his country by his virtues, to make tho&s;e happy who depend

on him, and &s;hall not him&s;elf be made mi&s;erable by Caro|line; he will forget perhaps, that &s;he exi&s;ts.!"</P>
<P>In the full per&s;ua&s;ion that all the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions were real, &s;he immediately took pen and paper; and, as imme|diately, wrote what follows.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Had Caroline refu&s;ed the title of Counte&s;s of Wal|&s;tein, which &s;he began to have &s;ome value for, the Ca|none&s;s would by no means have acq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie&s;ced in this &s;ame kind of &s;elf-denial; for while Caroline had been writing, her good Mamma had taken care to &s;end for all the &s;er|vants and inform them that Caroline was Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein, with a &s;trict injunction to call her my Lady, in future. She was punctually obeyed, and, in the &s;pace of a few minutes two or three of the maids, and as many footmen, entered, under different pretexts, purpo&s;ely to repeat <HI>my Lady.</HI> "What will <HI>my Lady</HI> plea&s;e to have? What are <HI>my Lady's</HI> commands?"</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had <HI>my Lady</HI> ended her letter than &s;he ran to read it to her dear friend. "Yes, Mamma," &s;aid &s;he, when &s;he had done reading, "I have taken a firm re&s;olu|tion to live and die here, and never love any body but you&middot;" A few months before, this project would have en|chanted the tender Canone&s;s, but &s;he had now far differ|ent views. Her imagination was at the highe&s;t pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m in favour of the Count of Wal&s;tein, and his re-union with Caroline, the accompli&s;hment of which
<PB N="27" REF="034126_0169_0FFA910CCCA87698">
was how the object of every wi&s;h. But, as it was a part of her plan to leave the young Counte&s;s ignorant of the manner in which &s;he was determined to act, &s;he pretended to approve her letter. Nay, perhaps, &s;he took no little plea&s;ure in retaliation (for there is no age or character that will not indulge revenge which they believe innocent) and, in in her turn, having her &s;ecret al&s;o. The letter was, therefore, &s;ealed and directed to the Count of Wal|&s;tein, at the Baron of Lindorf's, and &s;ome have pretend|ed that a &s;igh e&s;caped Caroline as &s;he wrote the direction, though &s;he, at pre&s;ent, prote&s;ts not; and if there did, we may well believe it was the la&s;t.</P>
<P>And now, not only this day, and the next day, and the day after that, but every day, the Count was frequent|ly pre&s;ent to the imagination of Caroline; and the more &s;he thought of him, the more &s;he delighted to think; all his letters were read, and read again; and &s;he every time thought &s;he di&s;covered new proofs, which had not before been remarked, of the &s;uperiority of heart and under|&s;tanding of this excellent man, whom &s;he had known too late ever to be able now to merit. The picture was taken from its box, tied to a ribband, and hung round the neck of Caroline&punc; which it no more quitted. Twenty times a day would &s;he take it from her bo&s;om, gaze on it with tenderne&s;s, and put it back with a &s;igh. But the more &s;he was convinced Wal&s;tein would have made her a mo&s;t happy woman, the more did genero&s;ity, and, perhaps, vanity, applaud the re&s;olution &s;he had taken, well per|&s;uaded he wi&s;hed not to live with her. There was &s;ome|thing, likewi&s;e, in her heart, which told her &s;he would much rather have him at Berlin than traver&s;ing di&s;tant regions with Lindorf. Indeed the &s;uppo&s;ition of her&s;elf being the cau&s;e of the exile of the&s;e two friends was in|&s;upportable. "Let one, at lea&s;t," &s;aid &s;he, "remain happy in his own country." And thus to &s;acrifice, in part, her own felicity to that of the Count was, in part, to expiate her own wrongs, and to obtain her own pardon.</P>
<P>While Caroline thus meditated the Canone&s;s was not idle. All her reflections tended to find what might be the be&s;t means of re-uniting the hu&s;band and the wife. Seve|ral very natural ones pre&s;ented them&s;elves to her mind, and which might ea&s;ily have been put in execution.&mdash; Such, for example, as to have a letter written to the Count, inviting him to come to Rindaw; or to take
<PB N="28" REF="034126_0170_0FFA91DB31792170">
Caroline to Berlin, under &s;ome feigned pretence, and there contrive Wal&s;tein &s;hould meet her, or, which might &s;till have been better, to have rea&s;oned with the young Counte&s;s, and, by degrees, induced her to a re-union, which &s;he her&s;elf was too de&s;irous of long to have refu|&s;ed. But all this was much too &s;imple for the Canone&s;s of Rindaw, too trivial for the end of a romance, in which &s;he was quite in raptures to be one of the <HI>dramatis per&s;o|nae.</HI> Surpri&s;e! Gratitude! Tears! Faintings! If the&s;e were wanting the &s;cene mu&s;t have been in&s;ipid. Read, therefore, what her prudent head imagined and brought forth.</P>
<P>One day (it was within a week after the letter of Ca|roline had been &s;ent) the Canone&s;s &s;aid &s;he had long had a de&s;ire to vi&s;it her Chapter, and to pa&s;s &s;ome time there; "A duty," &s;ays &s;he, "I have too long neglected, and which I wi&s;h once more to perform before I die. I will therefore &s;et off to-morrow morning, and beg, my dear, you will accompany me." Caroline, &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o un|expected a re&s;olution, repre&s;ented but in vain that her age, her infirmities, the permi&s;&s;ion &s;he had long obtained to live at Rindaw, all made this an unnece&s;&s;ary journey. The Canone&s;s was &s;o po&s;itive Caroline could not long contradict her. Be&s;ide that &s;he her&s;elf really took plea|&s;ure in imagining a change of &s;cene; it would retard her interview with her father, remove her for a time from a place which brought too many pa&s;t incidents to memory, and thus relieve her melancholy. Another motive was added. Long had &s;he de&s;ired to form an acquaintance with &s;ome young lady, to whom &s;he could reveal her &s;en&s;ations and her thoughts, and who might become her friend. The Barone&s;s of Rindaw, it was true, was a friend; but the re&s;pect ever pre&s;erved for a per&s;on by whom we have been educated, the great difference of age, and the infirmities which made her in continual dread of her death, and thus of being left in &s;olitude, without a friend on earth, all increa&s;ed an ardent de&s;ire to find another, who&s;e &s;oul and &s;entiments were corre&s;pondent to her own, who&s;e age was nearly the &s;ame, and with whom &s;he might freely &s;peak, or to whom &s;he might as freely write all &s;he thought and all &s;he felt.</P>
<P>"This," &s;aid &s;he, "would give a charm to the retreat in which I am doomed to pa&s;s my life. Ah! had I only &s;uch a friend as I can imagine, how &s;hould I love her,
<PB N="29" REF="034126_0171_0FFCA3D77369BE40">
and how would &s;he love me! She &s;hould live in my heart, and pre&s;ently would I forget othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions; forget that the man to whom, had I known him better, or better known my&s;elf, this heart would have been wholly devoted, now wi&s;hes to po&s;&s;e&s;s no place there!"</P>
<P>When they &s;ent her new books from Berlin, in which &s;he found a corre&s;pondence between two friends, &s;he would &s;igh, and &s;orrowfully &s;ay, "Poor Caroline, thou ha&s;t no creature, no friend, to whom thou maye&s;t write all thou thinke&s;t! Thou ha&s;t no letter to receive!" This to Caroline was a real grief, and when the Canone&s;s pro|po&s;ed the before-mentioned journey, &s;he imagined &s;he might &s;urely find, in the cloi&s;ter, young ladies of di&s;tinc|tion, &s;ome one of whom would be worthy, would be ca|pable of friend&s;hip. At length, therefore, &s;he very wil|lingly yielded to the project of the good Canone&s;s, and prepared for her departure on the morrow.</P>
<P>In the&s;e her &s;chemes of future confidence and friend|&s;hip, Caroline did not forget her precious manu&s;cript and the letters, which were become the daily &s;ubject of con|templation; and &s;till le&s;s her dear little picture, which never quitted her bo&s;om, except to be ki&s;&s;ed, and with which &s;he every day grew more and more enamoured. Till the expected friend was found this picture held the place of one, and was become the confidant of her mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts; to this &s;he confe&s;&s;ed all her regret and grief for having lo&s;t, pa&s;t return, the e&s;teem and friend|&s;hip of its counter-part; while the expre&s;&s;ive, the com|prehen&s;ive countenance &s;eemed, though dumb and mo|tionle&s;s, to hear, under&s;tand, and an&s;wer. The happie&s;t moments &s;he enjoyed were tho&s;e in which this mute con|ver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Early the next morning the Canone&s;s, Caroline, and their maids were in the carriage. The former was all cheerfulne&s;s, &s;he was ready fir&s;t, and &s;eemed to take ex|ce&s;&s;ive plea&s;ure in the journey. As &s;he &s;aw nothing, and had, therefore, no outward object to employ her thoughts, &s;he talked much, and wanted a de&s;cription of every place by which they pa&s;&s;ed. The fir&s;t objects, after leaving the court-yard, were the pavilion, the window where Caroline fir&s;t had &s;een Lindorf, the door through which he fir&s;t had entered, and the road along which he had
<PB N="30" REF="034126_0172_0FFA91DDE011A7E0">
pa&s;&s;ed when he departed never to &s;ee her more. A little further were the turrets of the chateau of Ri&s;berg; they had pa&s;&s;ed the wood in which Caroline had wandered, and came to the park where Lindorf had leaped the bar|rier to meet her; the difference between her former and her pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations was very great; her heart did not palpitate now, but it felt a painful contraction. In&s;tead of fixing her imagination on places that might retrace an obliterated pa&s;&s;ion, or, at lea&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion remembered only with repentence and &s;elf-reproach, &s;he turned her thoughts on the wrongs &s;he had done her hu&s;band, and mournful was the reflection. We may re&s;t well a&s;&s;ured, however, Caroline did not lead the communicative Barone&s;s to &s;peak on &s;uch a &s;ubject. The journey was performed without any accident, and her friend, infirm as &s;he was, pre&s;erved her cheerfulne&s;s, though &s;he no longer called her dear Caroline, but dear Counte&s;s, and that, too, at every in&s;tant. She often attempted, likewi&s;e, to &s;peak of the Count; but Caroline, more prudent, and re&s;train|ed by the pre&s;ence of the maids, equally fearing the Ca|none&s;s might &s;ay too much or too little, took good care to turn the conver&s;ation on other &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The place to which they were going was &s;ome days journey from Rindaw. Caroline &s;uppo&s;ed they were al|mo&s;t there, and was wi&s;hing to arrive ju&s;t as &s;he &s;aw the coachmen drive down an avenue that led to an antique and large chateau, the weather-cocks of which &s;he had perceived at a great di&s;tance. Caroline was &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;o told the Barone&s;s, who, with &s;ignificant &s;atisfaction in her countenance, an&s;wered, "the &s;ervants had obeyed her orders, for that &s;he meant to call and vi&s;it a friend who lived there." Caroline had not time to a&s;k que&s;tions concerning this friend, of whom before &s;he had never heard mention made, for they were already in the court-yard. The Canone&s;s called the footman, and bade him inquire if the <HI>Count of Wal&s;tein</HI> was there, and if two ladies <HI>of his acquaintance</HI> might have the plea&s;ure of &s;peaking with him.</P>
<P>Caroline could not believe her &s;en&s;es! "The Count of Wal&s;tein!" echoed &s;he, with a cry &s;carce articulate, "Great God! Mamma! Did I hear you right! Where are we? Whither have you brought me?"</P>
<P>"We are at the chateau of Ronebourg," replied the
<PB N="31" REF="034126_0173_0FFA910EA5F3A320">
Barone&s;s, with infinite plea&s;ure, "and I have brought thee to thy hu&s;band, my dear."</P>
<P>Poor Caroline &s;carcely hears the end of the phra&s;e: &s;en&s;e and feeling have for&s;aken her, and &s;he droops, mo|tionle&s;s, with her head on the &s;houlder of her imprudent friend! Her maid rai&s;es and &s;u&s;tains her, informs the Canone&s;s of the fearful &s;tate into which Caroline is fallen, and calls for &s;alts and hart&s;horn, which, in their flutter, are not to be found! And now the Canone&s;s, in de&s;pair, repents, too late, of what &s;he has done. Caroline conti|nues lifele&s;s, moves not, breathes not, betrays not the lea&s;t &s;ign of exi&s;tence!</P>
<P>All this pa&s;&s;ed in the coach, and in the middle of the court, in the front of the chateau, while the footman was gone to deliver his me&s;&s;age, and while the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e went in &s;earch of the Count, who was walking in the park with Lindorf.&mdash;Wal&s;tein is found, but cannot imagine who the&s;e unknown ladies are; for the Canone&s;s, always in &s;earch of &s;urpri&s;e, forbade the footman to give in her name, and the Count was very far, indeed, from imagining it was her, and his wife, from whom he had &s;o lately received a letter. He, therefore, ha&s;tens to re|ceive the ladies, and, followed by his friend, arrives. The fir&s;t object he beholds is Caroline, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, with her lace cut, her hair loo&s;e, her bo&s;om bare; they are lifting her out of the coach in which the Barone&s;s &s;its weeping, and raving, and &s;ummoning the whole univer&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Caroline, of who&s;e death &s;he accu&s;es her&s;elf, vow|ing not to &s;urvive her.</P>
<P>If a &s;pectacle like this well might affect the Count, in|explicable and &s;trange as it mu&s;t be, what effect may it be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had on Lindorf, who, the moment he &s;aw, knew Caroline? Scarcely could he believe his eyes! Scarcely credit the &s;trong emotions of his heart! "God of wonders!" cried he, as he ran up to the car|riage, "can this be?" He could not doubt.</P>
<P>The livid palene&s;s of Caroline, her clo&s;ed eye-lids, the cries and groans of the Barone&s;s per&s;uaded him &s;he had ju&s;t expired, and he him&s;elf was pre&s;ently almo&s;t lifele&s;s. Wal&s;tein, who comprehended nothing of what he be|held, &s;aw Lindorf reel, and ju&s;t had time to catch him in his arms. He revives, and beholding Caroline &s;till the &s;ame, in all the agonies of de&s;pair, exclaims, "It is &s;he! It is Caroline! Your Caroline! My Caroline! Her
<PB N="32" REF="034126_0174_0FFA9130A2968DA0">
whom I adored, her who now lies breathle&s;s, and whom I will follow to the grave!"</P>
<P>So &s;aying he tore him&s;elf violently from the arms of Wal&s;tein, who &s;tood &s;peechle&s;s and confounded! The exigencies of the moment recovered him from his &s;tupor: he made way through the crowd of &s;ervants, whom the cries of the Barone&s;s and the &s;trangene&s;s of the &s;cene had drawn together, and went to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Caroline. Expo&s;ed to the open air, &s;he had begun a little to reco|ver; her half-opened eyes endeavoured to move, and her woman, &s;eated on the ground, &s;upported her till an arm chair was brought, in which &s;he might be placed, and carried more conveniently. The poor di&s;tracted Cano|ne&s;s, &s;till in the carriage, paid dear for her imprudence; &s;he wept, exclaimed, called for the Count, and was un|appea&s;able till they told her he was there, and that Caro|line was recovering.</P>
<P>Too true it was. Wal&s;tein was there; but Wal&s;tein knew not whether all he beheld was or was not a dream. Caroline at Ronebourg, and brought thither with vio|lence! For wherefore &s;hould &s;he, el&s;e, be expiring at her arrival? Lindorf in de&s;pair, and fled, uttering words of dreadful import, that &s;till re&s;ounded in the ears of Wal&s;tein. <HI>It is &s;he! It is Caroline! Your Caroline! My Caroline! Her whom I adored!</HI> &mdash;Ay? Caroline?&mdash; Was it Caroline, whom Lindorf loved; and by whom he was again beloved? The Count endeavoured to doubt, to per&s;uade him&s;elf that his friend, di&s;tracted by grief, by the melancholy turn of his mind, had been deceived; but the Count could not &s;o elude his fears.</P>
<P>Not the change which a year had made in the per&s;on of Caroline, nor that her pre&s;ent illne&s;s cau&s;ed, could make Wal&s;tein mi&s;take her. He &s;ilently fixed his eyes on her for &s;ome momen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, then, kneeling at her feet, caught her hands, and pre&s;&s;ed them with ardour to his lips. The eyes of Caroline moved, but not as they were wont. They had no intelligence; &s;he knew not where &s;he was, or whom that man might be &s;he beheld pro&s;trate before her. Unable to articulate a word, &s;he gently with|drew her hands, joined them together, leaned her face upon them, and &s;hed a torrent of tears. The Count, &s;till kneeling by her, endeavoured to calm and convince her &s;he had nothing to dread, but was di&s;turbed by the repeated cries of the Canone&s;s, who ince&s;&s;antly called for
<PB N="33" REF="034126_0175_0FFA91125C3ECA08">
him, as &s;he &s;at in her coach, and who began to be very impatient that he did not come. At la&s;t &s;he called &s;o loud that Wal&s;tein was obliged to leave Caroline and go to her. He went with the hope of learning what might be the meaning of this &s;trange adventure; but the poor lady was &s;o affected, &s;o agitated, and &s;aid &s;o many things at once that to under&s;tand any one of them was impo&s;&s;ible. The Count, be&s;ide, was him&s;elf in a reverie. When he came up to the Canone&s;s he perceived &s;he was blind, and this was a new incident of information; he in&s;tantly re|collected the blind relation of whom Lindorf had &s;poken, in his letter to Peter&s;burg, and to whom the lady he lo|ved devoted all her cares. Could he have doubted of the fearful meaning of Lindorf's late exclamations, this would have removed his doubts. Alas! they were certainties.</P>
<P>The Count helped the Barone&s;s out of her carriage, and led her to Caroline, whom they had now &s;eated in a chair; nor could &s;he be convinced &s;he was &s;till alive till the dear girl &s;aid, with a feeble voice and a gentle mix|ture of reproach, "Ah! my dear Mamma, what have you done?" By little and little Caroline recovered her &s;en&s;es, but &s;he was &s;till &s;o weak, and &s;o ill, as to be whol|ly unable to walk; the Count, therefore, ordered them to bear her gently into the hou&s;e, and, giving his arm to the Barone&s;s, followed.</P>
<P>They concluded it was proper to put Caroline to bed; as &s;he her&s;elf, indeed, de&s;ired they would. The Cano|ne&s;s was determined to remain with her, and Wal&s;tein, after having ki&s;&s;ed her hand, which &s;he no longer with|drew, retired from her apartment and ha&s;tened into that of Lindorf, concerning whom he was become very anx|ious. He entered, but no Lindorf was there; as he look|ed round the room, however, he &s;aw a letter, lying &s;eal|ed, directed to him&s;elf. He took it, opened it with emotion, and read what follows, which had been traced by a trembling hand, expre&s;&s;ive of the great di&s;order of the writer.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter had been written with &s;o much ha&s;te and emotion that it was &s;carcely legible. Having once run it over, the Count immediately went in &s;earch of Varner, the valet de chambre of Lindorf. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s intention was to &s;end him off, immed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ately, after his ma&s;ter, to entreat him to return; but he pre&s;ently found this was impracti|cable. As &s;oon as Lindorf had found his fears were fal&s;e, and that Caroline was only in a fit, not dead, he in&s;tantly ordered his &s;ervants to &s;addle an excellent Engli&s;h hor&s;e&punc; while he wrote the above letter, after which he departed full &s;peed. He had told Varner to follow, with &s;uch baggage as was nece&s;&s;ary, and meet him at a place which he him&s;elf would take care to indicate; recommended
<PB N="35" REF="034126_0177_0FFA91160DF1D300">
every po&s;&s;ible attention and obedience to the commands of the Count, and his gue&s;ts, and in&s;tantly di&s;appeared, forbidding him to follow.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Count found there were no hopes of overtaking him, at pre&s;ent, he made Varner promi&s;e to inform him the fir&s;t intelligence he &s;hould receive, where his ma&s;ter was; then again peru&s;ed the letter, which brought tears into his eyes. Wal&s;tein now became im|patient to learn what could have been the motive of this &s;trange vi&s;it, and &s;ent to know if he might &s;peak with the Canone&s;s in a private apartment. She came immedi|ately, with the me&s;&s;enger, being as impatient to &s;peak as the Count was to hear. After informing him the Coun|te&s;s was fallen a&s;leep, "though," &s;aid &s;he, "the cata&s;|trophe has not happened exactly as I could have wi&s;hed, are not you exceedingly obliged to me, Sir, for having brought you Lady Wal&s;tein?"</P>
<P>"Before I can te&s;tify my gratitude, Madam, I mu&s;t be certain &s;he was not brought again&s;t her will."</P>
<P>"Again&s;t her will, my Lord! Surely you cannot &s;up|po&s;e it! Again&s;t her will! You do not know me. Do you think I would <HI>force</HI> the dear girl to any thing? No, my Lord, &s;he was quite plea&s;ed at the journey; nor has &s;he been &s;o cheerful for this many a day as &s;he was on the road&mdash;Quite impatient to arrive"&mdash;</P>
<P>"This is very &s;trange; unaccountably &s;trange," inter|rupted the Count; "I imagined her fainting&punc; her tears, what &s;he &s;aid to you with a tone of reproach, were all"&mdash;</P>
<P>"All amazement, at finding her&s;elf &s;o unexpectedly here&mdash;The agitation of a fir&s;t meeting&mdash;I know not what &mdash;young per&s;ons are &s;o timid. I own it would, perhaps, have been better to have prepared her for it; but then, on the other hand, where would have been the &s;urpri&s;e? And, if ever your hi&s;tory &s;hould be written, this will be the mo&s;t intere&s;ting event in your whole life.</P>
<P>The Count, who knew not the romantic turn of the Canone&s;s, a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;o &s;trange a remark, gazed with wonder, reque&s;ted an explanation, and learnt, at la&s;t, that, though Caroline was not brought to Ronebourg a|gain&s;t her will, it was without her knowledge; which proceeding he was very far from approving, and as frank|ly told the Canone&s;s &s;o, who excu&s;ed her&s;elf by her ar|dent de&s;ire to &s;ee them united, and the fear of not &s;uc|ceeding &s;o well by any other means. "Yet," &s;aid &s;he,

"had I &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;But, I confe&s;s, I had totally forgotten all that."</P>
<P>"What! What!" replied the Count.</P>
<P>"Oh, nothing&mdash;Nothing, nothing&mdash;Something I mu&s;t not mention; though it was certainly the cau&s;e of that fearful emotion and fainting&mdash;But, a propos, my Lord: I under&s;tand we are here at the hou&s;e of the Baron of Lindorf&mdash;that this &s;eat is his&mdash;'Tis true, I ought to have known it; but I mi&s;took, or forgot, for my memory is become &s;o weak lately&mdash;I believed, though I know not why, that Ronebourg belonged to you."</P>
<P>"No, Madam; but it is the &s;ame thing; I am at home, here; the Baron of Lindorf is my mo&s;t intimate friend, and begged me, in his ab&s;ence, to command his hou&s;e and &s;ervants."</P>
<P>"In his ab&s;ence! What, is he ab&s;ent then?" "He is," an&s;wered the Count, who, could he have &s;miled, have &s;miled he mu&s;t, at the prudent Canone&s;s, who, with &s;uch &s;imple cunning, told all &s;he knew.</P>
<P>"Ab&s;ent! I am quite happy at that! It is the luckie&s;t circum&s;tance!"</P>
<P>"Why lucky, Madam?"</P>
<P>"I&mdash;That is&mdash;I&mdash;Becau&s;e&mdash;he will not be afflicted&mdash; I mean troubled"&mdash;</P>
<P>The poor lady knew not what to &s;ay; &s;he was &s;orry to find &s;he had thought aloud, though that was by no means a new thing with her, and &s;he trembled le&s;t &s;he had di&s;|covered a &s;ecret which &s;he &s;upppo&s;ed it was of the utmo&s;t importance carefully to keep. The Count incr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ed her embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>"You mean to &s;ay, Madam, the Baron has avoided the ceremony of receiving &s;trangers; he not having the plea&s;ure of being acquainted with you?"</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding &s;he wi&s;hed to do it, the Canone&s;s could not tell a fal&s;ehood with that intrepidity the occa|&s;ion &s;eemed to require.&mdash;"No&mdash;Yes&mdash;That is&mdash;we are not wholly unacquainted; he happened to be one of our country neighbours; his e&s;tate of Ri&s;berg joins to mine, at Rindaw and we u&s;ed to &s;ee him every day: nay, indeed, he is, as I may &s;ay, one of our friends; though I think him a little given to change; a&mdash;a rover."</P>
<P>Wal&s;tein, who thought the Barone&s;s and this conver|&s;ation very &s;ingular, was going to defend Lindorf, when repeated cries from Caroline's bed-chamber alarmed him.

&s;he had ju&s;t awaken in a burning and delirious fever; and every &s;ymptom indicated the beginning of a very &s;e|rious and dangerous illne&s;s. Her maid, whom &s;he did not know, unable to hold her, was obliged to call for help. The Count, deeply affected, went up to her bed, out of which &s;he ab&s;olutely would get. "Let them take me back to Rindaw," &s;aid &s;he; "I won't &s;ee him, he will kill me; I will depart alone on foot; I will fly, to avoid him, to the world's end."</P>
<P>Her imagination, at other moments, full of Lindorf, made her take the Count for him; and, pu&s;hing him from her, &s;he conjured him to fly; reproaching him for being the cau&s;e of all her mi&s;ery. Then, again thinking &s;he &s;poke to the Count, &s;he exclaimed, with the utmo&s;t ten|derne&s;s, "Oh thou whom, for my happine&s;s, too late I have known, thou whom I love, whom I &s;hall forever love, wherefore do&s;t thou fly me? But I will follow, will &s;upplicate, will force thee to &s;ee and hear me."</P>
<P>Knowing only &s;o much as Wal&s;tein at pre&s;ent knew, it was impo&s;&s;ible he could &s;uppo&s;e Caroline thought of him while &s;he &s;poke la&s;t, or of Lindorf in what &s;he had &s;aid before. But, afflicted as he was for him&s;elf, he was &s;till more &s;o for Caroline. He would not leave her, but remained in her chamber all night, after having, with much intreaty, prevailed on the Canone&s;s to &s;leep in ano|ther apartment. Caroline continued in the &s;ame agitation and delirium. The Count, mean time, &s;ent to the neare&s;t town for the be&s;t phy&s;ician the place could afford; and, likewi&s;e, &s;ent a courier, po&s;t, to Berlin, for the fir&s;t men in the profe&s;&s;ion. He al&s;o thought it prudent to &s;end for the High Chamberlain; but, not wi&s;hing to alarm him, he only &s;aid, in his letter, he intreated him to come immediately, to Ronebourg, on an affair of the utmo&s;t importance.</P>
<P>The Count never quitted his po&s;t, by the bed&s;ide of Caroline, except when obliged, and then reluctant|ly. At day-break the country phy&s;ician arrived, and Wal&s;tein was greatly alarmed at perceiving his ignorance.

Her fever and delirium increa&s;ed, and on the third day &s;he &s;eemed to be in the utmo&s;t dan|ger.

Imagine what were the feelings of the Count, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> removed from all efficacious aid; for, let the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er make what ha&s;te he could, it was impo&s;&s;ible the phy&s;ician from Berlin &s;hould arrive before the &s;eventh or eighth day. The&s;e were days of cruel anxiety to Wal&s;tein, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were pa&s;&s;ed in momentary dread of &s;eeing her he adores expire. Her &s;ickne&s;s, by increa&s;ing his feelings, increa|&s;ed his attachment: the a&s;&s;iduous and tender cares he be&s;towed on her, the patience and gentlene&s;s &s;he di&s;co|vered at tho&s;e intervals when &s;he was not delirious, the character her maids gave her, and the real grief they &s;hew|ed, certain proofs how de&s;ervedly &s;he was beloved, all &s;trengthened his affection. To the dread of lo&s;ing her was added the reproach of being him&s;elf the cau&s;e of her &s;ufferings. He was convinced the &s;tratagem made u&s;e of to bring her thither, which was equivalent to violence, her dread of living with him, her pa&s;&s;ion for Lindorf and the natural &s;truggles of love and duty, had thus en|dangered and might rob her of life. In one of the&s;e mo|oments of grief, affection, and remor&s;e, pro&s;trate at her bed&s;ide, he took a &s;olemn oath, &s;hould heaven be plea|&s;ed to pre&s;erve her from the grave, be his &s;ufferings what they might, to make her happy.&mdash;"God of mercies!" &s;aid he, with hands uprai&s;ed to heaven, "Save this unfor|tunate victim of tyranny and love! Deign to hear the vow I make of re&s;igning her to the man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es her heart!"</P>
<P>Caroline was incapable of under&s;tanding, or, perhaps, &s;he would have intreated him to have been le&s;s ready to yield her to another; but &s;he had lain totally &s;en&s;ele&s;s du|ring the la&s;t four-and-twenty hours. Happily, the King's fir&s;t phy&s;ician arrived that night. He did not di&s;&s;emble the extreme danger in which he found the patient, and his whole dependence was on her youth. He admini&s;|tered, however, &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as had been too long de|layed, and &s;aid if &s;he outlived the ninth and thirteenth days he then &s;hould have &s;ome hope; but till they were pa&s;t could not pretend to give any.</P>
<P>The Count, though a prey to the mo&s;t &s;evere affliction, was obliged to di&s;&s;emble his feelings; for the Canone&s;s &s;uffered &s;o fearfully that her inquietudes were not the lea&s;t of his di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The lo&s;s of her &s;ight made it ea&s;y for tho&s;e who had no re&s;pect for truth to impo&s;e upon her; but not for Wal&s;tein. Her que&s;tions were ince&s;|&s;ant,
<PB N="39" REF="034126_0181_0FFA911A74A274F0">
and &s;he was never &s;atisfied unle&s;s &s;he heard the mo&s;t exact and circum&s;tantial account. After he had been carefully attending on Caroline, and, overcome with fa|tigue, had retired to take a little repo&s;e, &s;he never failed either to come to him, or &s;end to beg he would come to her. When he was ab&s;ent it was with the utmo&s;t diffi|culty they could keep her from Caroline, whom &s;he might di&s;turb but could not aid; the Count was the only per|&s;on who had any power over her, and &s;he was never &s;a|tisfied unle&s;s he was conver&s;ing with her. Thus was Wal&s;tein often torn from the pillow of Caroline, though he was wretched if he tru&s;ted her but for a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the care of others. He &s;upported all this wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tience, fortitude, and mildne&s;s, of which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> capable, and thought him&s;elf well rewarded for all his pangs by the melancholy plea&s;ure of watching the mo&s;t adorable of women. Then it was he felt a real gratitude towards the Canone&s;s for having brought her; for he &s;uppo&s;ed her pre&s;ent illne&s;s had a more remote cau&s;e than the agitation her arrival had occa&s;ioned; this might have ha&s;tened its cri&s;is, but he attributed it wholly to her pa&s;|&s;ion for Lindorf and her affliction at the &s;uppo&s;ed impo&s;&s;i|bility of union. In this conjecture every circum&s;tance confirmed him, and her determination to pa&s;s her whole life in retirement was not the lea&s;t. Again and again did he read the letter he had received from her, and in it could perceive nothing but a continued &s;acrifice of love to duty. <HI>Solitude has nothing fearful for my imagination; on the contrary, it is the boundary of my wi&s;hes.</HI>&mdash;"No, dear Caroline!" &s;aid he, "thou deceive&s;t thy&s;elf; or ra|ther virtue deceives thee. I were the mo&s;t barbarous, wor&s;t of men, were I longer to remain an impediment to the happine&s;s of two people to me equally dear, and who, for my &s;ake, are both de&s;cending to the tomb. O Caroline! O Lindorf! Wherefore do you not hear me? Wherefore may I not this moment be&s;tow you on each other?"</P>
<P>Neither did he doubt but that her tender exclamation, <HI>Alas! I have no regret but that of not having made the fir&s;t of mankind happy!</HI> was, at lea&s;t, as much addre&s;&s;ed to Lindorf as to Wal&s;tein!&mdash;"Happy," &s;aid he, "&s;ove|reignly happy, ought to be the man whom thou preferre&s;t; and happy he &s;hall be.&mdash;Can I flatter my&s;elf with being this man?

Where is &s;he that I may embrace her?"</P>
<P>"Alas! my Lord, behold where &s;he is;" an&s;wered the Count, pointing: "&s;he &s;eemed &s;omething better, and we began to hope&mdash;But I doubt le&s;t your entrance"&mdash;</P>
<P>In fact, the patient, di&s;turbed at the noi&s;e, opened her a&s;toni&s;hed eyes, looked round her, &s;aw her&s;elf in a &s;trange apartment, her father and her hu&s;band both by her bed|&s;ide, knew them, and, unable to &s;upport &s;o many emo|tions at once, fell into a more alarming delirium than &s;he had been in before.

Unable to remain long ab&s;ent from Caroline, he left them together, hoping, at lea&s;t, that the Baron would relea&s;e him from the care of attending on the Canone&s;s; but this hope was of &s;hort duration. Scarcely were they alone a minute before they mutually began to reproach each other.

Thus, proceeding from complaint to complaint, and from one cau&s;e of vexation to another, they at la&s;t were both &s;o angry, and &s;poke &s;o loud, that the Count was obliged to go and keep the peace.

<P>It is po&s;&s;ible that, at &s;ome moments, &s;uch a &s;cene might have been amu&s;ing; but not with Wal&s;tein's pre&s;ent tem|per of mind. He endeavoured to put an end to it, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h harmony, which he could no otherwi&s;e effect but by recalling to mind their former pa&s;&s;ion, at the re|collection of which the poor Canone&s;s melted. The High Chamberlain was not quite &s;o &s;oft; but the Count having reminded him of the obligations he had, and <HI>might</HI> &s;till have, to his friend, he was, almo&s;t immediately, &s;o moved that he could not expre&s;s his feelings; he went up to his dear Barone&s;s, and begged her to excu&s;e his warmth of temper; was &s;orry, very &s;orry, exceedingly &s;orry; while &s;he with dignity and affection gave him her hand to ki&s;s, telling him he abu&s;ed the power he had over her. After the High Chamberlain had devoutly paid his re&s;pects to this once fair hand, peace was re&s;tored, and the Count returned to his beloved patient.</P>
<P>Where is the reader who is not by this time acquainted with the character of Wal&s;tein? Who will not ea&s;ily imagine, although it be not circum&s;tantially related, the deep affliction of the&s;e his days of incertitude and dread? The more he thought the greater were his terrors; and, during the latter part of this &s;evere illne&s;s, he could not leave his Caroline, day nor night; he never quitted his arm chair, which was placed by her bed&s;ide; and if, at &s;ome moments, over-wearied nature exacted a &s;hort and painful &s;leep, he &s;oon waked and &s;tarted, with the mortal dread of no more finding her who was now become the only object of his thoughts. The thirteenth day at length arrived, which the phy&s;ician declared was to be the cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of her fate, and a dreadful day it was. The Count wi&s;h|ed &s;ingly to &s;upport its horror; he neither told the High Chamberlain nor the Barone&s;s that, perhaps, at midnight, their friend and daughter would be no more. He deter|mined to &s;it up alone with her; and oh! how ardent were the prayers he &s;ent up to Heaven for her relief! With what agonizing affection did he pre&s;s that feeble and burning hand to his lips and to his heart! How often did the tears &s;wim in his eyes while fixed on tho&s;e of Caroline, to which the fever &s;till gave motion, and which, perhaps, ere morning would clo&s;e eternally!</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="034126_0184_0FFA90DC651489D8">This la&s;t cri&s;is was &s;o violent that the alarmed phy&s;ici|an &s;aid nothingle&s;s than a miracle could make her live over the day. The di&s;tracted Count, &s;unk in grief, un|able longer to &s;u&s;tain the &s;ight, or to tear him&s;elf from the dying Caroline, had &s;till the farther pang of being obli|ged to prepare the father and the friend for the fearful cata&s;trophe. He had &s;o continually endeavoured to com|fort them, and in&s;pire hope, that, far from &s;u&s;pecting, they were lulled into a kind of &s;ecurity which mu&s;t ren|der the information tenfold horrid. The Count had pro|mi&s;ed to inform them how Caroline was, but, terrified him&s;elf at what he had to communicate, he &s;topped, for &s;ome moments, in the anti-chamber, to calm his own mind and collect all his fortitude. "Ah," thought he, "if this unfortunate father feels, as I do, all the weight of remor&s;e; if to the recollection of having &s;acrificed his daughter her death be added, how may he &s;upport his &s;orrow?&mdash;Oh! my Caroline, thy executioners weep, and thou die&s;t! Yet wilt thou not die unrevenged; for, &s;ure, the torments I &s;uffer are far wor&s;e than death."</P>
<P>While he was thus he&s;itating, the valet de chambre of Lindorf, &s;eeing him, came up ha&s;tily, and told him he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to him; he had received a letter from his ma&s;ter, who was waiting for him at Hamburg, whence he was to embark for England. Varner intended to &s;et off that very night, and only waited the commands of the Count. In&s;tead of giving an an&s;wer, Wal&s;tein &s;tood &s;ilent; ab&s;orbed in thoughs little &s;hort of di&s;traction: at length, &s;uddenly &s;tarting, he bade him wait, and went into his clo&s;et, without him&s;elf knowing what he intended.</P>
<P>"Write to Lindorf! And at a moment like this! What &s;hall I &s;ay to him? Shall I take the dagger, reeking from my own heart, and plunge it into my friend's? Shall I de&s;ire him to return, only that I may behold him expire on the tomb of her he adores?

<P>However vague might be the hope, that, ju&s;t then, &s;eemed to enlighten his imagination, he li&s;tened to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with plea&s;ure, and, &s;natching up the pen, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly wrote the following words:

<P>The Count him&s;elf took this &s;hort letter to Varner, commanded him in&s;tantly to &s;et off, never to &s;top, except to change hor&s;es, and, as he hoped for future favor or af|fection, not to mention a word of the illne&s;s and danger of the Counte&s;s, fearing le&s;t the dreadful tidings might wholly incapacitate Lindorf for the journey. Should he have the mi&s;ery to lo&s;e Caroline before the arrival of Lindorf, and to &s;urvive her death, Wal&s;tein was deter|mined to go and meet him, that they might together leave this land of wretchedne&s;s and de&s;pair, and, in a foreign country, together hear, together endure, their griefs and their regret.</P>
<P>This was de&s;tined to be a day of trial to the Count. As he was returning to &s;ee how Caroline did, a letter was brought him which had ju&s;t arrived.

<P>On the other &s;ide of the bed &s;tood their two maids, weeping, and a little farther, the High Chamberlain, &s;unk &s;ilent in an arm chair, with his hands &s;pread over his face, and overwhelmed with grief.

<P>The &s;ight, as the Count entered, the different attitudes and behaviour at the different per&s;ons, made him con|clude that all was over, and that the mo&s;t angelic of wo|men was no more.

Counte&s;s was not dead, and that he even had not lo&s;t in hope.

<P>"Oh God of benevolence!" exclaimed the Count, looking with fervour up to heav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and afterwards cla&s;p|ing the phy&s;ician's hands, "is it po&s;&s;ible, Sir! is it po&s;|&s;ible!&mdash;May &s;he &s;till live?

<P>"At pre&s;ent, Sir, my art is u&s;ele&s;s, and every other human aid; to nature we mu&s;t leave her, and to that con|&s;titution which mu&s;t have been naturally good, or &s;he would have been dead before this.

<P>They were about to quit the room when another &s;trange &s;cene of affliction and death drew their attention. Well might they have been &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ilence of the Ca|none&s;s, while all this pa&s;&s;ed; but, alas! the poor lady, whether her powers were too weak to re&s;i&s;t the terrors of the moment, or whether heaven had ordained that to be the period of her life and infirmities, a &s;udden &s;troke of apoplexy had, unpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceived by every per&s;on in the room, &s;eized her; &s;he was reclined on one of the pillows of Caroline, weeping, as they had imagined, but mo&s;t unable to weep, though &s;ome &s;igns of life &s;till remained.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;orrow of lo&s;ing his ancient mi&s;tre&s;s was added the fear of following her; he was the olde&s;t of the two, and her &s;udden death had &s;o much affected him that he imagined he had only a few moments to live. To behold, in the &s;hort &s;pace of ten minutes, his daughter expiring, her hu&s;band ready to attempt his own life, and his friend actually give up the gho&s;t, might well terrify an old man who was tenacious of life in proportion to his attachment to his great wealth and high dignities. He every moment repeated, "I feel I am very ill!"</P>
<P>Wal&s;tein, rou&s;ed by accumulating terror to recollec|tion, &s;aw the illne&s;s of the High Chamberlain was not dangerous, yet recommended him to the phy&s;ician's care, left the corps of the Canone&s;s to that of her women, and, after having &s;hed tears of &s;incere affection to the memory of her who had educated Caroline, and who&s;e friend&s;hip for her had apparently brought her to the grave, again en|tered the apartment of his dying lady. He &s;ent away the attendants, and approached her bed with feelings that &s;eemed the ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bingers of horror. Caroline &s;till continued in that &s;tate of &s;tupor or profound trance in which he had left her; the exce&s;&s;ive tranquillity of her &s;leep was terri|ble; a motion of the bo&s;om, almo&s;t imperceptible, was the only proof &s;he &s;till was alive, and this motion Wal|&s;tein imagined he every in&s;tant &s;aw dimini&s;h. As he &s;at be&s;ide her bed, the tears fell from his eyes, unperceived by him&s;elf; ince&s;&s;antly did he place the downy feather on her lips to find whether &s;he &s;till re&s;pired; and &s;o doubtful was it that he rai&s;ed his hands to heaven, and in&s;tinctively exclaim, "Why, O! why, cannot I die al&s;o!" Sometimes he fixed his eyes on her pale, yet ever charming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, the features of which &s;till pre&s;erved their enchanting form, and felt &s;en&s;ations of love, grief, and regret, &s;o forcible that the mo&s;t beautiful women in the bloom of health &s;eldom have in&s;pired their equals.</P>
<P>"Angel of bli&s;s," &s;aid he, pre&s;&s;ing his lips to one of her hands, "pure and cele&s;tial &s;pirit, and &s;halt thou die then, and never know how infini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely thou art adored by the cruel hu&s;band who has been thy a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!

<P>Then would he ri&s;e, after meditations like the&s;e, &s;o overwhelmed with affliction as to be ab&s;olutely without any di&s;tinct ideas, and almo&s;t on the verge of di&s;traction, would walk around the chamber with phren&s;y in his countenance; till, &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reproach for having an in&s;tant quitted her, fearing l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t her la&s;t &s;igh &s;hould e&s;cape and he not pre&s;ent, again with impetuo&s;ity would he approach. And thus was pa&s;&s;ed this dreadful night, which, notwith&s;tanding all he &s;uffer|ed, appeared to him very &s;hort. The rays of morning were the me&s;&s;engers of terror, the fearful moment ap|proached, and the &s;entence of the phy&s;ician was conti|nually pre&s;ent to his imagination; ince&s;&s;antly &s;ounding in his ear, <HI>If &s;he awake, I can then pronounce her recovery more than probable; but, I mu&s;t own, I think her awaking very uncertain.</HI> This dreadful incertitude was every moment increa&s;ing; for her &s;leep, while it was lengthened, &s;eem|ed every moment more profound, &s;o that, at la&s;t, he no longer had the lea&s;t hope.</P>
<P>While the Count was &s;tanding in this &s;tate of dread and de&s;pair, he heard her re&s;piration &s;uddenly increa&s;e, ap|proached, and &s;aw her brea&s;t begin to heave; and, pre|&s;ently, a deep &s;igh, almo&s;t a groan, e&s;caped.&mdash;Ah!

He utters an inarticulate cry, throws him&s;elf on the bed, and cla&s;ps her in his arms, as if to &s;natch her from the gra&s;p of death, or him&s;elf die with her.</P>
<P>But Oh! ble&s;t &s;urpri&s;e! Oh happine&s;s unhoped! It is not an inanimate corp&s;e; it is a living creature! that moves and endeavours to aid it&s;elf!

<P>"Yes, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, faintly, "I recollect you per|fectly; there is no other per&s;on on earth who is capable of &s;o much kindne&s;s, &s;o many cares, and of &s;uch un&s;ha|ken genero&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y!&mdash;But where am I?&mdash;Where are we? &mdash;At who&s;e hou&s;e?&mdash;For that I cannot recollect."</P>

<P>He was going to ring the bell, but Caroline &s;topped him by laying her hand on his arm.&mdash;"Only one word, Sir, and I have done. I promi&s;e to be docile, but I mu&s;t a&s;k you&mdash;Where is my dear mamma, my friend? Where is the Canone&s;s?

<P>"He is here; and you will &s;ee him again, as &s;oon as it is proper."</P>
<P>"But my dear mamma?"</P>
<P>"She has left us."</P>
<P>"Then &s;he is at Rindaw, I hope?"</P>
<P>Infinitely as Wal&s;tein dete&s;ted a fal&s;ehood, yet, this was no moment to he&s;itate; the life of Caroline was at &s;take.

<P>He rang, a &s;ervant came; he gave orders to call the
<PB N="50" REF="034126_0192_0FFA90E5C68F0038">
phy&s;ician, drew the curtains clo&s;e, &s;at down by the bed|&s;ide, and, notwith&s;tanding the exce&s;s of his joy, was &s;i|lent. And now, even at this happy moment, did the tender and preventive Wal&s;tein begin to revolve how he might be&s;t execute the melancholy ta&s;k of preparing Caroline for the death of her friend, &s;o as to give her the lea&s;t affliction po&s;&s;ible. The thing fir&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary was to conceal it from her till &s;he had fully recover|ed her &s;trength. While he was thus reflecting&punc; the phy|&s;ician entered and confirmed all his hopes. The pul&s;e, though very feeble, was excellent; every unfavourable &s;ymptom had di&s;appeared, and recovery was certain, pro|vided proper care was taken. This mu&s;t be ince&s;&s;ant; but could this be wanting while Wal&s;tein was pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>"Caroline is &s;o good, &s;o generous," &s;aid the Count, that &s;he her&s;elf, I am &s;ure, will be wholly obedient to your injunctions. Duty, friend&s;hip, love, all are &s;uppli|ants; certain of being favourably heard by her &s;ympathe|tic and affectionate heart."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Caroline, &s;oftly, do not fear, I will do every thing I am bid."&mdash;A tear that &s;tarted to her eye proved how much &s;he was affected by the tenderne&s;s of Wal&s;tein, and &s;he was going to have added more had not the phy&s;ician impo&s;ed &s;ilence. The Count and he went out together, and the phy&s;ician in&s;i&s;ted on the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of concealing the death of the Canone&s;s from Caroline; for the lea&s;t emotion, he &s;aid, mu&s;t indubitably have the mo&s;t fatal effects. The Count &s;huddered at the &s;uppo&s;ition, and immediately went with him to the High Chamberlain to con&s;ult the means of concealing this e|vent. A long &s;leep, out of which he had ju&s;t awaked, had &s;omewhat di&s;pelled his late fears of death, and the re&s;urrection of his daughter gave him &s;till higher hopes; e&s;pecially when he remembered, which he very expedi|tiou&s;ly did, &s;he was certainly left the &s;ole heire&s;s of her friend. The Count, fearing &s;ome imprudence on his part, and no way aver&s;e to rid him&s;elf of a man who&s;e cold and &s;elfi&s;h character gave him continual di&s;gu&s;t, en|deavoured to per&s;uade him that etiquette required he &s;hould accompany the corp&s;e of the Barone&s;s to Rindaw, and there &s;ee the la&s;t duties of humanity performed. This gloomy ceremony was not at all to his ta&s;te, but Wal|&s;tein, de&s;irous of determining him to go, told him that the will of the Barone&s;s was, no doubt, in favour of his
<PB N="51" REF="034126_0193_0FFA91D069A339B8">
family, and that his own intere&s;t required him to be pre|&s;ent at Rindaw, where this will mu&s;t be left, to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands and wealth bequeathed. This was &s;o unan&s;werable an argument to the High Chamberlain, that he never attempted to make another objection; he only required to &s;ee Lady Wal&s;tein, for thus he always called Caroline, before his departure. They therefore conclu|ded to tell her that the High Chamberlain was going to Rindaw, to inform the Barone&s;s of her recovery; and, when he was there, it would be ea&s;y to prepare Caroline, by degrees, in his letters, for the melancholy news of her friend's death.</P>
<P>Her father, therefore, was introduced into her cham|ber, where he told her, after his manner, how happy he was to &s;ee her &s;o well, and to leave her with a hu&s;band to whom, and for who&s;e cares and attentions, &s;he could not be too grateful: on which occa&s;ion he informed her of circum&s;tances &s;he knew not before; and when he told her the Count had neither undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf nor once quitted her chamber for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights, the tears &s;wam in Caroline's eyes, and, with tenderne&s;s and remor&s;eful recollection, &s;he &s;aid, "Oh my Lord! how &s;uperior, how noble is your mind! Ah! what would you do for a wife whom"&mdash;</P>
<P>She dur&s;t not add "<HI>whom you &s;hould love,</HI>" and the Count gave a very different interpretation to her break: he added "<HI>who could love you.</HI>" And thus did two hearts, naturally &s;o concordant, mi&s;take each other, and prepare them&s;elves new vexations, new torments. Every time that Caroline, unea&s;y for the health of the Count, conju|red him to take re&s;t, and prote&s;ted &s;he did not want a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, he, per&s;uaded &s;he de&s;ired his ab&s;ence, imagined that, to a good and feeling heart, the kind attentions of love it could not return, were each a dagger wounding Gratitude: and this painful, this di&s;tracting thought, would &s;ometimes make him abruptly leave her, which &s;he, on her part, attributed to indifference. Each, pa&s;|&s;ionately in love and convinced they were not beloved, attributed all tho&s;e actions to genero&s;ity, or to friend&s;hip, at the utmo&s;t, which &s;prang from a very different &s;en&s;a|tion. But let us not anticipate; return we to the High Chamberlain.</P>
<P>We have beforetime &s;een he was not &s;crupulous to ex|ce&s;s, concerning telling the whole truth, and nothing
<PB N="52" REF="034126_0194_0FFA90EA1971F638">
but the truth, on certain occa&s;ions: he, therefore, &s;o well played his part, that his daughter, very un&s;u&s;pectingly, a thou&s;and times thanked him for his kind attention to her dear Mamma, and a thou&s;and times intreated he would make ha&s;te to Rindaw. And &s;o many affecting expre&s;&s;i|ons did &s;he u&s;e, concerning that dear friend, who no longer exi&s;ted, that Wal&s;tein, unable to &s;uppre&s;s his feelings, intreated her to &s;peak no more, but to recollect the &s;evere injunctions of the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>"Well, well, I will be &s;ilent; only tell her, my dear father, that it is for her, for her alone, and to &s;ee her, once again, Caroline wi&s;hes to recover. Tell her, al&s;o, that the mo&s;t generous of men"&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;tood by her &s;ide, and interrupted her by gently laying his hand upon her lips.&mdash;She was prompted to have given that dear hand a ki&s;s; nay, the fir&s;t movement was made, nor do we know by what fear &s;he was re&s;trained, nor what her feelings preci&s;ely were. We only know a &s;light tremor &s;eized her, and that the Count, perceiving it, was far from imagining its true cau&s;e. He ha&s;tened the High Chamberlain away, and &s;aw him get into the po&s;t-chai&s;e with plea&s;ure. The corp&s;e of the Canone&s;s was to follow by night, and her women, and the &s;ervants &s;he had brought, to which were added others by the Count, were to e&s;cort it: Caroline's maid and footman &s;taid at Ronebourg, to attend on their mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician, who&s;e affairs required he &s;hould not long be ab&s;ent from Berlin, was de&s;irous to return; but the Count, however, by his earne&s;t entreaties, and the liberality of his pre&s;ents, prevailed on him to &s;tay a few more days, and not to quit his patient, while the mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;&s;ibility of danger or relap&s;e remained. Nor was this a di&s;tant period, each new day be&s;towed new &s;trength; already &s;he began to &s;it up, and to walk acro&s;s her room, leaning on the arm of the Count. Her reco|very, at length, could no longer be doubted, and the doctor departed for the capital, rewarded, beyond his hopes, for his &s;kill and care.</P>
<P>And now behold the Count alone, at Ronebourg, with his Caroline.&mdash;His Caroline?&mdash;Was &s;he his? Alas! he dur&s;t not regard her but as the &s;acred pledge, the de|po&s;it of friend&s;hip. His la&s;t &s;hort letter to Lindorf was recollected; the lover mu&s;t &s;oon arrive, and &s;hould he &s;end for this unfortunate lover only to make him a wit|ne&s;s
<PB N="53" REF="034126_0195_0FFA912CB5232E10">
of the woman he adored being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ano|ther? And mu&s;t Caroline, the tender-hearted Caroline, whom the &s;truggles of pa&s;&s;ion had brought to the brink of the grave, mu&s;t &s;he &s;ee him again, again to lo&s;e him? No; Wal&s;tein never had &s;o cruel a thought. More and more determined not to violate the oath he &s;o &s;olemnly had pronounced, when he beheld her dying, but to break the arbitrary chains that had bound her his, and unite her to Lindorf, he only waited the arrival of the latter to inform them both of his generous intentions, and the happine&s;s he was preparing for them. Fearing, however, le&s;t the exce&s;s of this happine&s;s might, at pre&s;ent, be too much for Caroline, he would not abruptly tell her what he meant to do; neither would he lay that grateful, that affectionate heart, under obligations which would be too oppre&s;&s;ive; &s;till le&s;s would he &s;uffer her to &s;u&s;pect the pangs his own heart felt in thus renouncing, thus yield|ing her to another. "She believes at pre&s;ent," &s;aid he, "&s;he owes her life to me, and, I know, would willingly &s;acrifice that life to my happine&s;s; but, no dear Caroline, no, never &s;uch &s;acrifice will I exact; I, I alone wi&s;h, I alone ought to &s;uffer, nor &s;halt thou ever &s;u&s;pect how in|finitely I &s;hould be mi&s;erable; never &s;halt thou imagine how ardently I adore; friend&s;hip only &s;halt thou &s;ee, even when affection is the &s;tronge&s;t; and if I, in return, may obtain thine, if I may make thee and Lindorf happy, &s;hall I be &s;o wretched as I &s;uppo&s;e?&mdash;Oh! Caroline, Caroline; yes, &s;trange parodox! I feel I may be wretch|ed even while I am virtuous!&mdash;To yield thee to another, and not to die, I mu&s;t no more behold, no more have intercour&s;e with thee!"</P>
<P>And according to &s;uch &s;uppo&s;itions did Wal&s;tein form a plan of conduct from which he promi&s;ed never to de|part, till the arrival of Lindorf. Not daring to tru&s;t the health of Caroline with any other, and unable, him&s;elf, to ab&s;tain from the plea&s;ure of admini&s;tering tho&s;e aids that might re&s;tore her to health, he &s;till continued them with all his former a&s;&s;iduity; but he took care &s;eldom to be alone with her; or, if &s;o, by chance, he found him|&s;elf, he took up a book and read, or played on the flute, of which he was a ma&s;ter, to amu&s;e her. And when he read, and when he played, there was &s;uch &s;en&s;ibility, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ion in every tone, in every &s;ound, that the melt|ing
<PB N="54" REF="034126_0196_0FFA90ECC7B16028">
&s;oul of Caroline was all rapture. Her mind, more &s;u&s;ceptible by her late &s;ufferings and pre&s;ent recovery, which gave a new charm to every object, became each day, each hour, more and more attached to that amiable hu&s;band, &s;o kind, &s;o complai&s;ant, &s;o de&s;erving of being beloved. Her inclination for Lindorf had but given la|tent pa&s;&s;ions action, had but rou&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility and dormant love, of which, till now, &s;he had only felt the &s;orrows and the remor&s;e; but, at pre&s;ent, authorized by duty, it had a charm, a fa&s;cination; the words happine&s;s, love, and hu&s;band, were united, and &s;he could not but hope he loved her, and had granted her pardon. Never did &s;he tire of making her maid repeat the various proofs of affection he had &s;hewn, during her illne&s;s; the nights pa&s;&s;ed in watching over her; the de&s;pair &s;o frequently vi&s;ible when he &s;uppo&s;ed her recovery impo&s;&s;ible; while each circum&s;tance augmented pa&s;&s;ion till love &s;eemed un|bounded, although &s;he dur&s;t not give it an epithet more tender than gratitude.</P>
<P>Attentive to the lea&s;t actions of Wal&s;tein, to every motion, and every word, &s;he was not long before &s;he re|marked the unea&s;y con&s;traint he laboured under, and the care he took to avoid all private and particular conver&s;a|tion relative to them&s;elves. At the very beginning of her recovery he had told her his friend Lindorf was on the road, that he would not be long before he would ar|rive, and that he, in the mean while, had his hou&s;e and &s;ervants at his di&s;po&s;al. The be&s;t of motives was Wal|&s;tein's, when he gave Caroline this information; but &s;he, too weak at that time, to enter into explanations, could not hear the name of Lindorf, and, e&s;pecially, his in|tended return, without a painful &s;en&s;ation, an inquietude &s;ufficiently evident, which but confirmed the Count in his &s;u&s;picions and intents. She, on the contrary, &s;up|po&s;ed he meant to try her; and, therefore, was the more confu&s;ed. How often did &s;he, afterwards, reproach her|&s;elf for not having &s;eized the opportunity of the moment to open her heart; for not confe&s;&s;ing her former and her pre&s;ent &s;entiments! Yet had &s;he a right &s;o to do?&mdash; When Lindorf fled and &s;acrificed him&s;elf for Caroline, might Caroline be permitted to ri&s;k the lo&s;s of his friend; to rob him of a protector; who, at la&s;t, might tire of an attachment which, to him, had been &s;o fatal?</P>
<P>To the&s;e reflections others were added, by which &s;he
<PB N="55" REF="034126_0197_0FFA912E6BDF79D0">
was re&s;trained. How might &s;he be the fir&s;t to tell the Count &s;he loved him, while &s;he doubted of his love for her, and while this doubt every day increa&s;ed? His pre|&s;ent conduct was the very rever&s;e of what it had been, during her illne&s;s; and &s;he knew not how to account for either the one or the other. If he love me not, thought &s;he, ince&s;&s;antly, whence that mortal dread of lo&s;ing me? Whence that de&s;pair which had nearly deprived him of life? Or, wherefore tho&s;e raptures, &s;o affecting and &s;o dear to memory, on the hopes of my recovery? Still I behold his tears of joy, &s;till I hear tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions &s;o kind, &s;o affectionate, which love alone could dictate.&mdash; But wherefore are tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions heard no more? Or why, now I am able to hear and an&s;wer, is he &s;ilent? Wherefore does he avoid me thus? Alas! it was compa&s;|&s;ion which agitated his capacious and benevolent mind, and which I mi&s;interpreted love, and now, pity gradually decrea&s;ing, re&s;entments &s;ucceeds&mdash;Oh! my Lord, and hu&s;band, did&s;t thou but know my heart, my love, my re|pentance, &s;urely thou would&s;t not remain unmoved; &s;ure|ly thou would&s;t pardon, nay, perhaps, mighte&s;t love, and we might &s;till be happy."</P>
<P>Then did &s;he be&s;tow her ki&s;&s;es and her tears on the picture which her woman had taken from her neck, when &s;he fainted, on their fir&s;t arrival; and which had been carefully concealed. This picture &s;he had a&s;ked for at the beginning of her recovery, and it was become to her the mo&s;t precious thing on earth. At length, unable any longer to &s;upport incertitude &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, &s;he re&s;olved to oblige the Count to come to &s;ome kind of explanation, by te&s;tifying her own de&s;ire to quit Ronebourg. Nor was this de&s;ire feigned; with regret &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf in a place &s;he had &s;o many rea&s;ons to di&s;like, and which &s;o continually brought to recollection an error &s;he could not pardon her&s;elf. What the Count had &s;aid, likewi&s;e, concerning the return of his friend, alarmed her. She could not comprehend the motive of this return, but, be it what it might, to be found at Ronebourg would be equally painful to him and her. She knew not how far the Count's knowledge of former tran&s;actions extended, for he neither &s;poke of Lindorf, him&s;elf, the letter he had received, the letters he had written, his de&s;ign to travel, nor of the place where he intended to leave Ca|roline. In fact, he was wholly &s;ilent. Unremittingly

employed, by his endeavours to amu&s;e and plea&s;e her, his attentions were the attentions of love, his language the language of indifference. Sometimes, when he read <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;en&s;ibility <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> played an affecting movement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of &s;ympathy would &s;tand in both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the moment the Count &s;aw tho&s;e of Ca|rolin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he would tear him&s;elf away, that he might conceal emotions he could not always conquer.</P>
<P>Then would Wal&s;tein bury him&s;elf in the reclu&s;e for|e&s;t covert, or &s;hut him&s;elf up in his cabinet, that he might freely utter his complaints, and vent feelings by which he was oppre&s;&s;ed. Happy Lindorf! would he &s;ay; thou knowe&s;t not all thy bli&s;s; knowe&s;t not my lo&s;s. Come, Oh! come, and dry the tears of Caroline, which flow at thy remembrance, that I may behold her happy ere I die!</P>
<P>Sometimes he would reproach him&s;elf for &s;uffering her to remain ignorant of her approaching felicity; for not &s;aying to her, Lindorf, the regretted, the beloved Lin|dorf, &s;hall be your hu&s;band. But how might he &s;ay this, unle&s;s he were more certain he could fulfil his promi&s;e? Lindorf came not, wrote not; and how if death, &s;paring Caroline, had &s;truck his friend! How, if Lindorf was no longer a living being! His blood froze at the thought&mdash; Merciful God! &s;aid he, thou heare&s;t my prayers for Ca|roline! Oh! hear them, al&s;o, for my friend! Let him return, let him be happy, and I, only, mi&s;erable!</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of his &s;i&s;ter was an additional grief. De|ceived by her cheerfulne&s;s, her levity, which was but the levity of infancy, and mi&s;taken in the per&s;everance of her character, he had &s;uppo&s;ed her love for Lindorf very feeble, and that the Baron de Za&s;trow would pre&s;ently efface the fleeting &s;en&s;ations. But her letter &s;hewed him his error, proved her pa&s;&s;ion real and la&s;ting, and wound|ed him to the heart for having given it birth, unable as he was, honourably, to give it con&s;ummation. Matilda, like him&s;elf, was in love, and, like him&s;elf, was wretch|ed; he knew he had but to intimate a wi&s;h and Lindorf would marry her, would thus a&s;certain to him the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Caroline; Lindorf would refu&s;e him nothing, and Caroline was too much attached to her duty for him to doubt &s;he would any longer te&s;tify her former repug|nance. But it was not for Wal&s;tein to &s;elfi&s;hly take ad|vantage of the genero&s;ity of others, and abu&s;e the power gratitude gave. Not his own, no, not his &s;i&s;ter's happi|ne&s;s

would he thus acquire; nor, indeed, was happine&s;s po&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s it were mutual. The &s;uppo&s;ition of her being united to a man who&s;e heart another po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was not to be borne; he, therefore, re&s;olved, without explain|ing a &s;ecret which not only required too circum&s;tanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a relation for a letter to contain, but, by coming &s;o &s;udden|ly might have a fatal effect, to prepare her for the lo&s;s of Lindorf, and, therefore, thus he wrote.</P>

<P>Ah! Matilda, your brother's pro&s;pects of happine&s;s are as few as yours. Yet, if I am not deceived, I hope, by affording each other mutual aid, by uniting our rea&s;on and our fortitude, we, perhaps, may ri&s;e &s;uperior to the misfortunes that threaten us, and create a &s;pecies of hap|pine&s;s for our&s;elves, founded on &s;elf-approbation, and the grateful remembrance of having &s;acrificed our own feli|city to the felicity of our friends.&mdash; You under&s;tand me not.

</LETTER>
<P>With this letter he &s;ent another to his aunt, Madam de Za&s;trow, in which he told her that certain rea&s;ons obli|ged him no more to think of the union of his &s;i&s;ter and his friend; and that, therefore, he &s;hould be happy could &s;he be induced to favour the Baron de Za&s;trow; but he conjured her not to be precipitate, and by no means to u&s;e the lea&s;t violence. He further &s;aid he &s;hould &s;oon come to Dre&s;den, and intreated his aunt not finally to di&s;po&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter till his arrival.</P>
<P>The&s;e two letters being &s;ent, and thus being more tran|quil, relative to the fate of Matilda, the Count applied him&s;elf wholly to the plan he had formed, in order to a&s;certain the happine&s;s of Caroline. He had de&s;ired the High Chamberlain to come to Ronebourg, &s;o &s;oon as his daughter &s;hould be informed of the death of the Barone&s;s. It could not be long before Lindorf mu&s;t arrive, and the Count was determined to &s;et off for Berlin the moment he came; pretending to have received an order from the King, and to leave Lindorf at Ronebourg, with the High Chamberlain, that he might obtain a divorce from his Maje&s;ty, and his con&s;ent, al&s;o, for the marriage of Lin|dorf and Caroline. He then intended to write and inform them of their happine&s;s; and, without &s;eeing them, to depart for Dre&s;den. From Dre&s;den, he meant to go to England with Matilda; or without her, if &s;he determined to marry the young Baron de Za&s;trow; and to re&s;ide there with his mother's relations. He felt &s;ufficient fortitude to make Caroline and his friend happy, but not to be a daily witne&s;s of their loves; and this plan, once fixed, he held to be unalterable.</P>
<P>Alas! he knew not yet all the power of love; had yet
<PB N="60" REF="034126_0202_0FFA91EC58738968">
not felt all its vengeful effects. The more he &s;truggled with pa&s;&s;ion, the deeper was it rooted in his heart. How often, when be&s;ide Caroline, unable to re&s;train his feel|ings, was he ready to kneel at her feet, confe&s;s his affec|tion, his internal &s;truggles, his de&s;pair; appeal to her genero&s;ity, recall to mind the &s;acred bond by which they were united, the vows they had mutually made, and em|ploy every re&s;ource, of pity and of pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;upplicate her con&s;ent to live and die with the hu&s;band by whom &s;he was adored. By &s;light only could he obtain a victory over him&s;elf, on the&s;e occa&s;ions. Once out of her &s;ight, and virtue, delicacy, and friend&s;hip, again were a&s;cen|dant. Love ceded to duty; and he had the fortitude to imagine Caroline in the arms of another, and not expire at the thought! Then would he remember Lindorf, ba|ni&s;hed from his country, dragging an unhappy being through foreign climates, deprived of his mi&s;tre&s;s and his friend, without con&s;olation and without hope; and, re|membering, &s;hudder and dete&s;t his weakne&s;s: again re|new his oaths to &s;ubdue it, and, fearing to expo&s;e him&s;elf to future dangers, deprive him&s;elf of the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing Caroline; who, ill interpreting the cau&s;e of his ab|&s;ence, would, on her part, weep and afflict her&s;elf at conduct which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mo&s;t unequivocal proof of indifference.</P>
<P>In her moments of vexation and de&s;pair, &s;he &s;trength|ened her&s;elf in the re&s;olution of returning to Rindaw, and of intreating, nay, of ab&s;olutely requiring his con&s;ent, &s;hould he offer any oppo&s;ition. "Alas! would &s;he re|ply to this doubt, "far from oppo&s;ing, he will gladly &s;eize the means of living &s;eparate from Caroline.&mdash;Sepa|rate!&mdash;What, am I no more to &s;ee him, to hear him no more? And, when I quit this place, mu&s;t a la&s;ting &s;e|paration en&s;ue? And mu&s;t I a&s;k it; mu&s;t I my&s;elf pro|nounce the fatal &s;entence? No! never &s;hall I acquire force adequate to a ta&s;k like this! When he &s;hall have the cruelty to command, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion will &s;urely be &s;uffici|ent puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>Yet did her friend&s;hip for the Barone&s;s, at &s;ome mo|ments, make her even de&s;ire th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and vanqui&s;h her fears of quitting Wal&s;tein. The High Chamberlain, as had been concerted with the Count, endeavoured to prepare her to &s;upport the death of her friend. In his fir&s;t letters, he &s;poke of remedies &s;he had taken, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eco|ver
<PB N="61" REF="034126_0203_0FFA65B3B297D7E0">
her &s;ight, which were powerful and &s;omewhat dan|gerous. He afterwards wrote word her blindne&s;s was pa&s;t cure, and that it afflicted her &s;o much &s;he had fallen ill. Caroline no &s;ooner heard this than &s;he wi&s;hed to fly to attend and con&s;ole her; but &s;he her&s;elf was yet too feeble for the fatigues of &s;uch a journey. She wrote the mo&s;t affecting letters, both to her friend and her father; and, every returning courier, hoped to hear of her recovery. At length the letters of the High Chamberlain became &s;o alarming, and affirmed &s;o po&s;itively the Barone&s;s of Rindaw was in the utmo&s;t danger, that Caroline immedi|ately determined to &s;et off; and &s;ent to beg the Count would come and &s;peak with her.</P>
<P>He found her with her eyes &s;wimming in tears, and well divined their cau&s;e. "Oh! Sir," &s;aid &s;he, the moment he entered, "read here what my father has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rit|ten! My dear mamma is very, very ill; nay, perhaps, wor&s;e than he &s;ays. Let me intreat you to give imme|diate orders for my departure; for I will in&s;tantly be gone to Rindaw. Never &s;hall I forgive my&s;elf for hav|ing de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yed &s;o long. Should I be too late, &s;hould I never more behold the tendere&s;t, deare&s;t of friends&mdash;"</P>
<P>The Count, finding this idea had pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her mind, and that the apprehen&s;ion had had half its effect, thought this the time to inform her of the truth: be&s;ide that her re&s;olution to depart, immediately, made &s;ecr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y any longer impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;"Dear Caroline," &s;aid he, &s;eat|ing him&s;elf be&s;ide her, and taking one of her hands, "let me intreat you in the name of Heaven to be calm; think of the injury you may do your&s;elf! Scarcely recovered from a mo&s;t dangerous illne&s;s, can you &s;u&s;tain&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Yes, any thing, every thing! It is my duty to devote my returning &s;trength to the &s;ervice of the friend who has been, to me, the be&s;t and tendere&s;t of mothers. I feel how much I have neglected this duty, and &s;hall, indeed, be mo&s;t happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, may I but have the means to repair my wrongs."</P>
<P>She was going to ri&s;e and make preparations, but the Count again detained her. "A moment, dear Caroline, be appea&s;ed for a moment, I conjure you, and li&s;ten to me&mdash;I have al&s;o received a letter from your father."</P>
<P>"Merciful God!" cried &s;he, turning pale, and pre|&s;aging what was coming; "a letter to you! Tell me! I

beg you, in&s;tantly, tell me its contents. Has my father concealed any thing?&mdash;Oh! Sir,&mdash;" Her oppre&s;&s;ed heart could no longer re&s;i&s;t the violence of agitation, and her &s;obs interrupted &s;peech. The &s;ilence of the Count, his downca&s;t eyes, the timid compa&s;&s;ion of his counte|nance, and the vague an&s;wers he returned, confirmed her fears, and her de&s;pair became exce&s;&s;ive. "Oh God! Oh God!" exclaimed &s;he, "I perceive, I perceive, I no longer have a friend, no longer have any thing in this world! My dear Mamma no longer exi&s;ts, and I have lo&s;t my all!"</P>
<P>"Not &s;o, dear Caroline; there &s;till is a friend in the world, who hopes to prove how dear you are to him, and how much he is intere&s;ted in your happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Caroline loved this friend too well her&s;elf to be wholly in&s;en&s;ible of that con&s;olation he wi&s;hed to impart; and to tho&s;e new proofs of tenderne&s;s which &s;he no longer had dared to hope. Her tears &s;till flowed, abundantly flowed, but le&s;s bitterly. In the a&s;&s;aults of violent grief, the feeling and impa&s;&s;ioned mind experiences relief by the company of a beloved object, and in the alleviations of love. She grieved, but the Count grieved with her, felt as &s;he felt, and partook of her affliction. In the&s;e their moments of melancholy, their &s;ouls were in uni&s;on. Caroline had lo&s;t the tendere&s;t of friends, but the very moment in which &s;he was informed of this misfortune was that which gave her the &s;weet hope of being beloved, by the hu&s;band &s;he adored; for, in this fir&s;t tran&s;port of de&s;pair, which &s;oftened fortitude and &s;hewed Caroline &s;till more lovely, the Count was not able wholly to re|pre&s;s his pa&s;&s;ion. The &s;orrow of Caroline demanded every care and con&s;olation friend&s;hip could afford; and Wal&s;tein, while he endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume the form of friend&s;hip, had all the tendere&s;t actions and looks of love. Caroline, thus, in the mid&s;t of affliction, had a glimp&s;e of a happy futurity, and mourned that her friend was not to be a witne&s;s of her bli&s;s.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired to be informed circum&s;tantially of her ill|ne&s;s and death; but the Count, who under&s;tood nothing &s;o ill as di&s;&s;imulation, referred her to the High Chamber|lain, who would &s;oon return; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to quiet her remor&s;e for having too long delayed going to the aid of her friend, he told her &s;he had died &s;ome time &s;ince, and when it was impo&s;&s;ible for Caroline to have gone to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

No &s;ooner was the High Chamberlain informed that his daughter knew the truth than he returned to Ronebourg, and told her, him&s;elf, &s;he was left &s;ole heire&s;s to the Ca|none&s;s. She had made her will anew, afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he had been informed of her marriage, and it was to the Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein &s;he had bequeathed all her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: &s;he had indeed left a legacy to the Count, purpo&s;ely, as &s;he her|&s;elf had worded it, to prove how highly &s;he was &s;atisfied at his union with Caroline. She recommended, in mo&s;t affecting terms, the happine&s;s of this her beloved pupil, to Wal&s;tein; and to Caroline that of the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ublime of men.</P>
<P>The reading of the will drew many tears from Caro|line; nor was the Count le&s;s affected. The High Cham|berlain, alone, read it with perfect &s;atisfaction, and com|prehended not how an augmentation of fortune could become the &s;ubject of &s;orrow. Caroline, alas! found on|ly new motives, in the&s;e benefactions, to regret a friend &s;o tender and &s;o generous. Wal&s;tein, di&s;tracted by a thou&s;and contrary &s;en&s;ations, could not hear of union and happine&s;s, which he &s;o &s;oon was to renounce, without extreme emotion. When the Baron came to that article, he &s;uddenly kneeled to Caroline; "Yes," &s;aid he, with vehement tran&s;port, "yes, by honour, by love, by every thing &s;acred, I &s;wear, you &s;hall be happy, Caroline"&mdash; He could not continue; and Caroline, affected to exce&s;s, tenderly &s;tretched out her hand to rai&s;e him, while &s;he felt, more powerfully than ever, that on him only, of all the world, this her promi&s;ed happine&s;s depended, and on the &s;entiments he &s;hould entertain for her.</P>
<P>Had they been alone, perhaps &s;he might then have told him what hers really were; perhaps this might have been the happy moment of an explanation too long delayed; but the pre&s;ence of the placid High Chamberlain checked &s;uch effu&s;ions of the heart. He, with wonderful tran|quillity, continued to read his will; which contained nothing farther, except legacies to &s;ervants and va&s;&s;als. The Count, unable to &s;upport the continuance of his pre&s;ent emotion and the tears of the compa&s;&s;ionate Caro|line, left the room and walked into the park, whither all his feelings went with him. He began no longer to un|der&s;tand his own proceedings; and, &s;ometimes, a&s;ked him&s;elf wherefore he thus &s;hould wilfully be forever mi|&s;erable. Wherefore &s;hould he yield the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her
<PB N="64" REF="034126_0206_0FFA91F1ABECA100">
on whom he had &s;o many claims, and without whom it was impo&s;&s;ible to live? "She begins," thought he, "to be accu&s;tomed to me; nay, I even think I behold expre&s;|&s;ions of affection in her eyes. Alas! I know it can be but friend&s;hip, e&s;teem, gratitude; yet may not the&s;e &s;en|&s;ations, in a mind like hers, well &s;upply the place of love? Or may I ever hope to in&s;pire others? Does &s;he not already grant more than I could ever expect?&mdash; But, while I know, pa&s;t doubt, her heart wholly apper|tains to another, to Lindorf!&mdash;Lindorf? Alas! perhaps he no longer is in exi&s;tence; perhaps he has &s;unk under his grief, under the grief of Caroline, by which my own heart has been &s;o often wounded, and which mu&s;t be re|newed, with &s;uch exce&s;s, &s;hould &s;he hear tidings &s;o fatal!"</P>
<P>The Count &s;huddered while he imagined he him&s;elf might be the me&s;&s;enger to inform Caroline of the death of the man &s;he loved; that he him&s;elf mu&s;t then be con|&s;idered as the cau&s;e of his death. The &s;ilence of Lindorf after the &s;hort letter he could not but have received, ap|peared to him a certain proof his fears were but too well &s;ounded; and &s;o much did this and &s;uch like fears tor|ment him, that &s;carcely could rea&s;on &s;u&s;tain the conflicts of the heart. At one moment he would pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;h the return of Lindorf, and dread it wor&s;e than death the next; equally fearing to &s;ee him arrive, or to hear he was no longer in exi&s;tence. Thus did a man &s;o philo&s;o|phic, &s;o &s;age, &s;o wholly till then ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, at length, feel the empire of pa&s;&s;ion and its tyrannic pow|er; and, while thus he felt, terrified at its effects, again &s;wore to vanqui&s;h it, to devote him&s;elf, if it were not too late, to the felicity of tho&s;e he loved.</P>
<P>From one of the&s;e tormenting terrors he was, at la&s;t, relieved. He received a letter from Varner, the valet de chambre of Lindorf, to whom he had given his &s;hort and pre&s;&s;ing letter, written to conjure his friend to re|turn. "The good Varner entreated his Excellency not to be unea&s;y at not having yet received an an&s;wer to this letter, for that, when he came to Hamburg, his ma&s;ter was not there; he had embarked, a few days before, for England, with a Saxon gentleman: and he, Varner, de|tained three weeks at Hamburg by contrary winds, had neither been able to join his ma&s;ter, who expected him at London, nor, con&s;equently, to remit to him the letter his Excellency had confided to his care."</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="034126_0207_0FFA68D8737969F8">The fir&s;t plea&s;ure of the Count was to learn that Lin|dorf &s;till lived, and by being able to travel, was in good health. Nor was this plea&s;ure &s;ingle; Lindorf had not received his letter; his return was therefore deferred; and this &s;hort delay, which likewi&s;e deferred the moment when Wal&s;tein &s;hould be obliged to quit Caroline, cede her to another, and live for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever from her, was to him an age of happine&s;s. He ha&s;tened therefore to her chamber, that he might not lo&s;e moments &s;o precious. Her father was with her. "My dear Count," &s;aid the High Cham|berlain, as he entered, "my daughter here, is exceeding|ly de&s;irous of quitting Ronebourg, but dares not &s;peak to you on the &s;ubject. For my part, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on in the world why you &s;hould remain longer here; for, at pre&s;ent, the Counte&s;s is &s;ufficiently recovered to under|take the journey. The King may complain of your long ab&s;ence; he commanded me to ha&s;ten your return to Berlin, and in a tone that will not admit of longer delay; and I mu&s;t certainly be gone; for my pre&s;ence is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary at court. If, therefore, your Excellency &s;hall think proper to give orders, we will incontinently depart together."</P>
<P>The Count made no reply, but fixed his eyes on Caro|line; in order to enquire of her countenance what was pa&s;&s;ing in her heart, and whether &s;he really wi&s;hed to leave Ronebourg. Caroline blu&s;hed, looked down, and, by her &s;ilence, &s;eemed to approve. Yet was the embar|a&s;&s;ment of the Count beyond de&s;cription great. He could not be ignorant how much the King de&s;ired his return; for, &s;ince his arrival from Ru&s;&s;ia, he had only remained four-and-twenty hours at Berlin; and had had but one &s;hort interview with his Maje&s;ty. To the friend|&s;hip of the Sovereign, only, was he indebted for his pre|&s;ent long ab&s;ence; and frequent couriers brought him pre&s;&s;ing letters from the King; or rather from a man who reclaimed his friend. Wal&s;tein knew, likewi&s;e, that his marriage with Caroline was then become public. The High Chamberlain, who &s;o long had laboured with this &s;ecret, had told it to the whole world, as &s;oon as his daughter was gone to Ronebourg. The King him&s;elf, knowing the Count and Counte&s;s were together, had openly &s;poken of their union; wherefore longer my&s;tery was impo&s;&s;ible. Yet how might the Count, with his pre&s;ent intentions, take Caroline to Berlin as the Coun|te&s;s
<PB N="66" REF="034126_0208_0FFA91F459D8CA70">
of Wal&s;tein, and there pre&s;ent her at court, and to every body, by a name &s;he &s;o &s;oon was to quit?</P>
<P>He then felt how much the delay of his letter to Lin|dorf deranged all his projects. He no longer could refu&s;e the reque&s;t of the King, which might every moment be changed to a command: he could not think of leaving Caroline, alone, at Ronebourg; and &s;till le&s;s of taking her to Rindaw, where every thing mu&s;t tend to nouri&s;h and increa&s;e affliction. While reflecting, in this dilemma, how he mu&s;t act, Caroline, pre&s;&s;ed by her father to con|firm her de&s;ire to depart immediately, &s;aid, "&s;he &s;hould, with plea&s;ure, accompany my lord the Count to Berlin; but that &s;he hoped, both he and the king would have the goodne&s;s, for &s;ome time, to di&s;pen&s;e with her &s;eeing com|pany; and that, while &s;he remained in mourning, &s;he might be permitted to live retired."</P>
<P>Wal&s;tein eagerly caught the idea; and the health of Ca|roline, not yet &s;ufficiently re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, together with her deep mourning for a friend whom &s;he had loved as a mother, were, in reality, excellent pretexts for comply|ing with her reque&s;t, and neither receiving nor paying vi&s;its, at Berlin, for &s;ome months. In le&s;s time than that Wal&s;tein well might hope his future fate would be de|cided. Caroline, mean while, would live almo&s;t unknown, at Wal&s;tein-hou&s;e, where &s;he would &s;ee only her father, and him&s;elf; which, to him, was a mo&s;t plea&s;ing reflecti|on. It was &s;ome alleviation to de&s;pair not to be obliged to quit her before the dreaded hour of final &s;eparation &s;hould arrive. The &s;age in love is but a man. The Count no longer &s;aw impediments. Caroline living in his hou&s;e, and in his &s;ight, was perfection of bli&s;s; and, though he &s;till de&s;tined her for a man he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he loved, though &s;till determined carefully to conceal his own pa&s;&s;ion, he could not refu&s;e him&s;elf this intermediate enjoyment of happine&s;s; which, be&s;ide, would remove every difficulty, relative to where Caroline &s;hould remain.</P>
<P>The day of departure was, therefore, fixed; and the tender Caroline beheld it arrive with rapture. She &s;hould no longer live in the man&s;ion of Lindorf: it was now determined &s;he &s;hould for ever pa&s;s her life with the hu&s;|band &s;he adored, and &s;he thought her&s;elf certain of &s;oon effacing from his memory, by offices of tender affection, the capricious and erroneous conduct which her heart, at pre&s;ent, di&s;claimed; and which &s;he her&s;elf could never

pardon. Wal&s;tein, attentive to every action and look o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Caroline, perceived &s;he went with plea&s;ure; but this plea&s;ure he a&s;cribed to virtue, and to the de&s;ire &s;he had, henceforth, of avoiding every thing that might bring Lin|dorf to memory. His e&s;teem, con&s;equently, his affecti|on, were redoubled; but, thinking thus, he was but the more &s;trongly confirmed in his determination of reward|ing the virtue he &s;o much admired.</P>
<P>Behold them, then, at Berlin, and alighting at Wal|&s;tein-hou&s;e; a place of &s;o much former terror to Caroline. She entered it with all tho&s;e gentle &s;en&s;ations, tho&s;e mild hopes, &s;o &s;weet to the &s;oul, and which &s;eemed a prelude of the felicity &s;he was about to enjoy. To the&s;e &s;ucceed|ed the recollection of her bridal day, her behaviour to the man &s;he now adored, the mixture of hope and fear con|cerning the real &s;entiments of the Count, and the melan|choly reflection on the death of her dear friend, whom &s;he wi&s;hed a witne&s;s of her pre&s;ent happine&s;s. The&s;e, all con&s;piring, contributed but to augment that emotion which &s;he no longer could conceal, and which brought the tears into her eyes. The Count &s;aw tho&s;e tears; his heart melted at the &s;ight; he attributed them to a very different cau&s;e, and would in&s;tantly have given her every a&s;&s;urance that cau&s;e &s;hould be removed; but we have be|fore &s;een the motives by which he was withheld. He would not give her a pro&s;pect of bli&s;s as yet uncertain; nor would he have to combat with her delicacy and gene|ro&s;ity. Neither, indeed, had he the power to pronounce <HI>I yield Caroline to another.</HI> No, he might have acted; but, on &s;uch a &s;ubject, he could not have &s;poken!</P>
<P>The High Chamberlain &s;upped with them, and retired inflate with joy at beholding his daughter now e&s;tabli&s;hed Lady of Wal&s;tein-hou&s;e. When he was gone, the Count led Caroline to the apartment which had long been de&s;tin|ed to receive her; at the time of his marriage, and while he was far from pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ging the events that were to &s;ucceed. He had furni&s;hed it with all po&s;&s;ible ta&s;te and magnifi|cence, in the dear expectation that his young and beaute|ous bride was &s;oon to become its inhabitant. This expec|tation, at la&s;t, was realized. But how? In what manner? And at what moment? How much might he well regret pa&s;t &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and the hope which, during uncertainty, he had cheri&s;hed!</P>
<P>"This, dear Caroline," &s;aid he, as they entered, "i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="68" REF="034126_0210_0FFA91F71AD1CC88">
the apartment which has long been re&s;erved for you."&mdash; Caroline, who &s;uppo&s;ed a latent reproach was lurking in the&s;e few, words, looked down, and alternately blu&s;hed and turned pale. Wal&s;tein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw this, but &s;aw not the true motive. Eager to deprive her of her fears, "You," &s;aid he, re&s;pectfully ki&s;&s;ing her hand, "are ab&s;olute here; queen of this apartment, neither I nor any one el&s;e &s;hall enter it, without your free permi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily the Count retired; had he rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned a moment longer, he, perhaps, had forgotten Lindorf and all his oaths&mdash;"Ye powers of friend&s;hip!" cried he, as he en|tered his own chamber, "&s;u&s;tain my fortitude. Caroline, dear adored Caroline, Lindorf, my friend, appear, be ever pre&s;ent to my imagination, there ince&s;&s;antly repeat you cannot be happy a&s;under!"</P>
<P>Thus did the whole night pa&s;s in mourning over and lamenting his de&s;tiny, and the rigid &s;acrifice which virtue, principle, friend&s;hip, and even love it&s;elf, loudly demand|ed. Caroline, though more tranquil, yet &s;lept but little and reflected much. Though her cha&s;te &s;implicity felt not all the &s;ingularity of Wal&s;tein's conduct, yet could &s;he not be wholly ignorant that her &s;pou&s;e had a right to partake of her apartment; and &s;he thought her own wrongs too many, and too great, not to attribute his leav|ing her thus too well-founded re&s;entment. Succeeding evenings but confirmed the idea; Wal&s;tein, fearing again to encounter dangers he found him&s;elf &s;o near &s;inking under before, not only forbore to accompany Caroline to her apartment but began, as he had done at Ronebourg, Before &s;he knew the death of the Barone&s;s, to ab&s;ent him|&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible, and never be with her, except in the pre&s;ence of her father, or her women; and even then he had an air of con&s;traint, of anxiety, &s;o vi&s;ible, he fear|ed &s;o much to meet her eyes, or to approach her touch, that &s;he no longer doubted of his indifference; nay &s;he even dreaded it was aver&s;ion.&mdash;This conduct, far from irritating, &s;en&s;ibly affected Caroline.

She recollected his travelling de&s;ign, and doubted not but he &s;till intend|ed it &s;hould take place; &s;he even, for a moment, thought to prevent his being again at the pain of propo&s;ing her return to Rindaw; and thus, by voluntarily ab&s;enting her&s;elf from the Count and the court, re&s;tore him the li|berty of which &s;he thought him &s;o ardently de&s;irous.&mdash; But this propo&s;al was become much more difficult to exe|cute than when &s;he wrote her letter at Rindaw. At pre|&s;ent &s;he loved him, pa&s;&s;ionately loved him; and never could &s;he collect the fortitude to abandon the object of this her mo&s;t tender affection.&mdash;Therefore, her de&s;ign was no &s;ooner formed than for&s;aken; and to that &s;ucceed|ed the re&s;olution to try all po&s;&s;ible means of regaining the heart of her hu&s;band, and, by love, obliterating the re|membrance of former wrongs. While &s;he meditated &s;he hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> "He is &s;o benevolent, has &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility, is &s;o little inclined to revenge injuries," &s;aid &s;he, "that, when he &s;hall behold how infinitely I love him, will he refu&s;e to return my love; or will he not, at lea&s;t, grant me his friend&s;hip?"</P>
<P>Thus did the noble and &s;ympathetic heart of Caroline cling to her Wal&s;tein&punc; thus teach her how to e&s;timate his worth; and thus did hope, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h mild and benignant im|pul&s;e, bid her &s;eek his &s;ociety with greater a&s;&s;iduity than ever he &s;ought to avoid hers. Ob&s;ervant of this new ar|dor, the Count, far from imagining him&s;elf beloved, at|tributed all the attentions, all the thou&s;and kindne&s;&s;es of Caroline to &s;y&s;tematic gratitude, and duty; which a &s;oul &s;o feeling, and &s;o virtuous, as hers, had impo&s;ed upon it|&s;elf. Momentary appearances confirmed the &s;u&s;picion. Caroline, young and timid, feeling &s;en&s;ations &s;he thought &s;he had not the power to communicate, reproaching her|&s;elf for, and even exaggerating former errors, fearing by officiou&s;ne&s;s to di&s;plea&s;e a hu&s;band prejudiced again&s;t her, often had an air of re&s;erve and con&s;traint, which per&s;ua|ded Wal&s;tein her heart was acting contrary to its mo&s;t ar|dent de&s;ires. Sorrowful at the ill &s;ucce&s;s of her endea|vours to in&s;pire affection, often would &s;he &s;uffer melan|choly to invade her mind; often would retire to her chamber, and on her lovely cheeks leave traces of tears
<PB N="70" REF="034126_0212_0FFA91F9D242C630">
which the Count imagined to be the bitter tears of duty&punc; &s;hed in lamenting the &s;everity of fate, that &s;eparated her from the man &s;he loved.</P>
<P>Him, day after day did Wal&s;tein wait for; him, the lover and the friend, for whom felicity &s;o &s;upreme was held in re&s;erve; nor could he comprehend wherefore he did not return. Be&s;ide the letter he had &s;ent by Varner, he had al&s;o written after his arrival at Berlin; and his letter, under cover to, and recommended to the care of Lindorf's banker, at Hamburg, by him to be forwarded to England, mu&s;t have reached him if he were not alrea|dy on the road, coming back. This letter was more pre&s;|&s;ing than the former. Without fully expre&s;&s;ing all he meant, he u&s;ed every argument to ha&s;ten his return. "On this his own happine&s;s, and the happine&s;s of tho&s;e he mo&s;t loved, depended; if prayers and entreaties were not &s;ufficient, he ab&s;olutely exacted a compliance.&mdash;Re|collect, dear Lindorf, how often you have given me the right of di&s;po&s;ing of your future de&s;tiny. This right, which I hold from friend&s;hip, and, perhaps, from grati|tude &s;omewhat too enthu&s;ia&s;tic, I now claim. Yes, I now recall to memory every circum&s;tance which may make you hold your&s;elf my debtor, to tell you the hour is come when it depends on you to cancel them all, and, by one &s;ingle act, place all obligation to my account. I can only add, if in a month, at farthe&s;t, I have not the plea&s;ure to embrace you, at Wal&s;tein-hou&s;e, you will give me rea&s;on to doubt of an attachment which I think I de&s;erve, and to &s;uppo&s;e I no longer have a friend!"</P>
<P>This letter, &s;o &s;trong, &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, remaining unan&s;wer|ed, gave room to imagine, and even to believe that, in fact, Lindorf had &s;et out for Berlin before it arrived at England; and that con&s;equently he mu&s;t &s;oon be there. Dreadful as this moment was, in which a &s;eparation from her he adored was to take place, &s;till Wal&s;tein waited for it with a kind of impatience, ari&s;ing from a conviction it would a&s;certain the happine&s;s of Caroline, and from a wi&s;h of being him&s;elf freed from that inquietude which &s;uffers the &s;oul to wander among illu&s;ive chimeras, which an in&s;tant might de&s;troy, and to which mi&s;ery it&s;elf is &s;ome|times preferable.</P>
<P>How, indeed, was he to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the phantoms of hope, &s;eductive and dear as they are to the heart, and who&s;e &s;pells each day became more irre&s;i&s;table&punc;
<PB N="71" REF="034126_0213_0FFA68EB2D4CB5D0">
Nothing, indeed, but the mode&s;ty and pre&s;ent error of Wal&s;tein could have prevented him from perceiving they were not phantoms, were not illu&s;ive. Far from de&s;i&s;t|ing, Caroline was &s;till more affectionate, more attentive, mild and tender. The happine&s;s of her exi&s;tence was the prize for which &s;he contended. And how might &s;he perform too much for a hu&s;band like Wal&s;tein, whom &s;he &s;o long had offended, by aver&s;ion mo&s;t unju&s;t; to whom her heart had been unfaithful, and which had &s;o many errors, nay, to Carol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; crimes to obliterate? Re|pul&s;ing diffidence, therefore, and hoping every thing from per&s;everance and affection, a thou&s;and kind arts were employed to draw and attach him to her, of which love alone is &s;u&s;ceptible, and to which love alone can give &s;uch wondrous force.</P>
<P>The Count was exceedingly fond of mu&s;ic, and Caro|line was ince&s;&s;ant in her endeavours to arrive at excel|lence. Often did &s;he intreat him to accompany her on the flute or violoncello, which he played equally well; often did &s;he &s;ing, with all the charms of &s;en&s;ibility, the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive and melting airs, and &s;uch as mo&s;t were likely to make impre&s;&s;ion on a &s;oul like Wal&s;tein's. The Count had a ta&s;te and talents for drawing, but other oc|cupations had prevented him from making any great pro|gre&s;s in the art. Caroline, on the contrary, educated in retirement, had applied her&s;elf with infinite &s;ucce&s;s to that delightful art, which can people &s;olitude, and, in de&s;pite of wintry fro&s;t, retrace nature's beauties, create meads, rivers, mountains, and fore&s;ts, and make perma|nent the fleeting and peri&s;hing beauties of Flora. Caro|line was particularly &s;ucce&s;sful in flowers and land&s;capes; which al&s;o was the &s;pecies of painting the Count mo&s;t preferred. She offered to in&s;truct him&punc; direct his e&s;&s;ays, and correct his errors; in return for which, &s;he entreated him to &s;elect books, and &s;uperintend &s;tudies which &s;he was de&s;irous to engage in, but which are too generally neglected in the education of women. While he was drawing by her &s;ide, &s;ometimes would &s;he read, and her former cu&s;tom o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reading aloud to her dear Mamma, added to the native intelligence and feeling &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, rendered her indeed a mo&s;t excellent reader. Wal&s;tein, when he &s;aw her fatigued, would read in his turn; and while her countenance, obedient to the powers of genius, a&s;&s;umed the pa&s;&s;ion, or imbibed the wi&s;dom of the wri|ter,
<PB N="72" REF="034126_0214_0FFA91FC7B266908">
her &s;kilful and delicate fingers would knit, or knot, or embroider, the garter, the pur&s;e, or the wai&s;tcoat; all of which were de&s;tined pledges of affection for her Wal|&s;tein. Ever de&s;irous of finding new &s;ources to give him plea&s;ure, every action had that for its object. For him only did &s;he exi&s;t, and continually would &s;he invent pre|texts either to go into his apartment, or invite him into hers. Though &s;he &s;aw no per&s;on but him and the High Chamberlain, who &s;upped with them almo&s;t every even|ing, never was &s;he dull for want of company. Far from that, &s;he continually refu&s;ed the &s;olicitations of the Baron to pre&s;ent her at court, &s;eemed mo&s;t de&s;irous of prolong|ing her retreat, and, with mild and timid eyes turned to Wal&s;tein, &s;aid "never before had &s;he been &s;o happy!" Yet, notwith&s;tanding all the thou&s;and hourly-repeated proofs of love which Caroline no longer ought to hide, &s;till did the Count, fa&s;cinated by fear, and dreading to yield to the &s;en&s;ations by which he was continually a&s;|&s;aulted, repel truth, and retain foregone and chimerical conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>"Not for me," would he &s;ay, "is it to be beloved. No: the affectionate, the tender, the adorable Caroline has the art of giving to friend&s;hip&mdash;alas! what did I &s;ay? Not even to friend&s;hip, but, to &s;imple gratitude&punc; all the appearance and expre&s;&s;ion of love. It is not the pre&s;ence of Wal&s;tein, but the remembrance of Lindorf, by which &s;he thus is animated; and to him, doubtle&s;s, doth &s;he &s;e|cretly addre&s;s all tho&s;e affecting attentions, tho&s;e tender &s;peeches, and tho&s;e &s;weet looks, which may not have me for their true object&mdash;What! know I not that &s;he loves Lindorf!

And yet, how may I make this known, certain, as I am, that duty, genero&s;ity, and compa&s;&s;ion would dictate her an&s;wer? Though &s;he love me not, her pre&s;ent actions and manner prove &s;he would not an in&s;tant he&s;itate to &s;a|crifice her heart and her happine&s;s to me."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="034126_0215_0FFA68F18A2BED78">Thus tormented, thus agitated by hope and fear, did the Count make both him&s;elf and the tender Caroline mi&s;erable. But &s;en&s;ations &s;o violent cannot long endure: Lindorf comes not, nor will the Count find, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ither in delicacy or friend&s;hip, the power to re&s;i&s;t love that thus is indu&s;trious to convince him it is mutual.</P>
<P>One evening, when the High Chamberlain was detain|ed at court, the Count &s;upped alone with Caroline, who was more tender, more endearing, more enchanting than u&s;ual. If &s;he <HI>&s;aid</HI> not I love, it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;under&s;tand her <HI>actions.</HI> The emotion, the agitation of Wal&s;tein augmented every moment, and he mu&s;t either betray his feelings or fly the danger. He ju&s;t had &s;trength &s;ufficient to perform this painful ta&s;k, but it was the la&s;t effort of rea&s;on. Shut up in his own apartment, he re|flected on his pre&s;ent &s;tate, his love, his claims, and the conduct of Caroline.</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid he, "it is not, it cannot be illu&s;ive. I am beloved. I no longer have cau&s;e to doubt. If I touch her hand I feel it tremulous; or if &s;he takes mine &s;he gently holds and pre&s;&s;es it, unwilling it &s;hould be with|drawn; if I quit her with mournful looks her eyes fol|low me; and, this very evening I beheld them moi&s;ten|ed with her tears. All the animation, all the tenderne&s;s of affection, were painted in her countenance; and yet I left her; yet I forbore to kneel at her feet; yet I for|bear to tell her how infinitely I adore her; neglect to &s;upplicate a confirmation of my happine&s;s, and of that love which every incident tends but to confirm."</P>
<P>Never had the idea pre&s;ented it&s;elf to him with &s;o much force and certainty: it enrapt him &s;o far that, no longer li&s;tening to aught but &s;weet hope, he determined to return, confe&s;s his pa&s;&s;ion, and obtain from Caroline an avowal of hers, of which he no longer doubted. All his oaths, re&s;olutions, and projects di&s;appeared; all were annihilate; he forgot that Lindorf had exi&s;tence: Caro|line, only, he beheld! His Caroline! To him united, by him beloved, and him loving; nor was there longer mortal man who &s;hould bear away this trea&s;ure of his &s;oul!&mdash;In an in&s;tant, Wal&s;tein, again, is in her apart|ment. He &s;ees her not, but he hears her guitar, hears the melody of &s;ounds that vibrate to his heart; he ap|proaches, &s;oftly, a door half open, that leads to a &s;mall chamber, whither Caroline had retired. It was her fa|vourite
<PB N="74" REF="034126_0216_0FFA92004C9EBE50">
apartment; there &s;he pa&s;&s;ed an hour, every even|ing, before &s;he went to bed, reading, &s;inging, or playing. Caroline was half undre&s;t, reclining in an arm-chair, and gently touching her guitar as &s;he &s;ang. The air was me|lancholy, and &s;he &s;eemed deeply affected; &s;topped occa|&s;ionally, and put her handkerchief up to her eyes; then again continued, with le&s;s power, but more pa&s;&s;ion in her voice. Wal&s;tein thought he had known all her fa|vourite &s;ongs, yet this was new to him. He li&s;tened with mute attention, earne&s;t to hear the words. Caro|line &s;ang &s;o low that he could only catch now and then a a line, one of which, however, &s;truck him, and he li&s;|tened &s;till more eagerly. At la&s;t he di&s;tinctly heard the following part of a &s;tanza:
<Q><L>Ah! wherefore, love, or whither fly,</L>
<L>In &s;earch of bli&s;s I'd fain impart?</L>
<L>If thou for&s;ak'&s;t me, how may I</L>
<L>Hope cheri&s;h in this bleeding heart?</L></Q></P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ion, the marked tenderne&s;s&punc; with which &s;he &s;ang, were &s;ufficient proofs that Caroline's complaint had reference to a real, not an imaginary lover. But who was this lover? Was it Lindorf? Was it Wal&s;tein? Diffidence and doubt again po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; he looks, he li&s;tens, and pre&s;ently the &s;hadowy plea&s;ure of doubt it&s;elf vani&s;hes. Caroline laid her guitar in her lap, and untied a black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bband which &s;he always wore around her neck. Till then the Count had &s;uppo&s;ed it was only an ornament; but he &s;aw with &s;urpri&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> minia|ture picture was pendant to it, and which Caroline had always carried concealed in her bo&s;om. Too far off to di&s;tingui&s;h the features, he yet could &s;ee, as &s;he put it to the candle, that it was the uniform of an officer in the Pru&s;&s;ian guards; it was therefore, the uniform and the portrait of Lindorf! Caroline, at fir&s;t, fixed her eyes upon it, then pre&s;&s;ed it to her heart, and next to her lips, with extreme pa&s;&s;ion. The tears ran down her cheeks, and fell upon the picture; &s;he carefully wiped them off, again looked and &s;ighed, laid it on the table, took up her guitar and &s;ang another &s;tanza of the &s;ame &s;ong, which the Count di&s;tinctly heard.</P>

<P>When &s;he had ended, &s;he once more took up her ple|&s;ure, gave it another ki&s;s, tied it round <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and, as &s;he put it down her bo&s;om, &s;aid, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of tenderne&s;s and chagrin, "Thou, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> for&s;ake me&punc;" then, taking up her candle, pa&s;&s;ed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her bed-chamber, after having rung for her attendants, without &s;o much as looking towards the half open door. The action of ri&s;ing, the removal of Caroline, and the darkne&s;s in which Wal&s;tein was left, awakened him from a kind of &s;tupor into which he had &s;unk; from a dream of terror, which, as he awoke, in&s;tead of vani&s;hing was con|&s;umed! All his imagined happine&s;s was fled, and again he was ingulphed in wretchedne&s;s at the very in&s;tant imagination had conducted him to the ultimate of bli&s;s! Yet, ever generous, even in the horrors of de&s;pair, his fir&s;t intention was, when he had &s;omewhat recovered him|&s;elf, to go immediately to Caroline, not to intercede for him&s;elf, but to a&s;&s;ure her Lindorf, her fugitive, her be|loved, &s;hould return, &s;hould be hers. The arrival of the maids, however, prevented him from executing this his de&s;ign, and he pre&s;ently afterwards felt he no longer had the fortitude, per&s;onally, to tell her he would for ever yield her to another. His heart palpitated with &s;uch vi|olence that &s;uch a declaration &s;eemed as if it mu&s;t have co&s;t him his life; and he even &s;huddered le&s;t, had he &s;een her at that moment, in&s;tead of acting as friend&s;hip and ju&s;tice required, he, in his delirium, &s;hould &s;uffer pa&s;&s;ion to invade the rights of love.</P>
<P>No, he would &s;ee her no more! He might not, could not, dur&s;t not &s;ee her more! He &s;till found &s;ufficient virtue to fly, to re&s;tore her to liberty, but never to bid her an eternal adieu; or again to gaze on tho&s;e impa&s;&s;ion|ed eyes, the danger of which he had &s;o recently proved. He returned therefore to his chamber, where he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in a &s;tate of unde&s;cribable angui&s;h; incapable of determination, of all certitude whether love or gene|ro&s;ity, Lindorf or Wal&s;tein &s;hould prevail. He wrote letter after letter to Caroline: in one he claimed his rights and endeavoured to move her compa&s;&s;ion: dete&s;ting his tyranny, and tearing this, he began another, in which
<PB N="76" REF="034126_0218_0FFA920325C10230">
he bade her for ever farewell, without the lea&s;t mention of his own excruciating pangs. "What," &s;aid he, again, with increa&s;ing agitation, tearing the paper, "&s;hall &s;he even remain ignorant of the adoration in which I hold her? Shall I die without &s;o much as exciting her com|pa&s;&s;ion?" He began once more; once more painted his love in all its enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the &s;acrifice he was about to make in all its horrors. Still le&s;s &s;atisfied than ever, he tried anew to write with more moderation; and again and again he tried, and was each time alike un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>At length, however, the fatigued and exhau&s;ted &s;pi|rit &s;ank into a gloomy calm, and Wal&s;tein came to a firm and irrevocable determination.&mdash;This was to go the King, who never was in bed long after day-break, and to whom he was never denied admittance, to obtain, immediately, without further let or delay, a divorce; to &s;end it in&s;tant|ly to Caroline, and as in&s;tantly to leave Pot&s;dam, retire to his e&s;tate at Wal&s;tein, and there make proper preparations for travels which he knew not when he &s;hould end. The more he reflected on pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and the con|trary pa&s;&s;ions by which he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf and Caroline tormented, the more did he per&s;i&s;t in this project, and deeply regretted not having put it in execution immedi|ately after his arrival at Berlin; in&s;tead of &s;uffering him|&s;elf to be thus &s;educed by the fa&s;cinating plea&s;ure of li|ving with Caroline. "Long &s;ince," &s;aid he, "would &s;he then have been ea&s;y, and I my&s;elf perhaps le&s;s wretch|ed; I then &s;hould not have known the enchantment of her &s;miles, the irre&s;i&s;table allurement of her friend&s;hip, and the bewitching influence of her attentions: or, at lea&s;t, I &s;hould have known them but in part; attentions which I interpreted into love, and which might have &s;upplied its ab&s;ence, had I remained ignorant that &s;he loves another, over who&s;e memory &s;he in &s;ecret mourns. &mdash;Mourn! Does Caroline mourn? Caroline! For whom I would &s;acrifice a thou&s;and lives! And &s;hall I he&s;itate then to yield up my happine&s;s?"</P>
<P>The thought was mo&s;t natural and appea&s;ing to the noble heart of Wal&s;tein. He wrote, or rather began to write a letter to &s;end Caroline when he &s;hould have ob|tained a divorce. He afterwards wrote al&s;o to the High Chamberlain, to give this tran&s;action &s;uch a colouring a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that he might not impute it to his daughter, or Lindorf. The&s;e letters he put in his pocket, and, aided by his v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="77" REF="034126_0219_0FFA68F5EDEB3BD8">
de chambre, made every nece&s;&s;ary preparation for his travels. As he &s;uppo&s;ed he was no more to vi&s;it Berlin, he pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the night in putting his papers in order, and collecting certain of them, which he meant to take with him. As &s;oon as day appeared, he &s;et off for Pot&s;dam, where the King then was, and entreated a &s;ecret audience.</P>
<P>How, in the mean time, was poor Caroline employed? &mdash;She awoke from a &s;weet &s;leep, which had calmed her inquietude, and already began to be impatient again to &s;ee that dear and cruel hu&s;band who thus fled her embraces, and whom &s;he yet had hoped to win by affection and per|&s;everance. Nay, indeed, &s;he had lately flattered her&s;elf with &s;ucce&s;s, and that there was very little of the extra|ordinary in his conduct. He &s;eemed plea&s;ed to be with her, &s;eldom left her during the day, and had all tho&s;e little preventive cares which are &s;o peculiar to love; &s;he often caught him looking pa&s;&s;ionately at her, and, once, &s;urpri&s;ed him ardently ki&s;&s;ing a ringlet of her hair. What more was nece&s;&s;ary to Caroline? Educated in the utmo&s;t innocence, without friend&s;hip or other conver&s;ation than that of the cha&s;te Canone&s;s, never having read other books than what &s;he recommended, &s;he was mo&s;t happy when in the &s;ight and hearing of her hu&s;band.&mdash;To &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf beloved, to pa&s;s her life in his company, was bli&s;s &s;upreme; and when he quitted her, at night, her only chagrin was that of being &s;eparated from him till the mor|row. The&s;e, likewi&s;e, were the only moments in which &s;he no longer doubted of his love; "for," &s;aid &s;he, "he might &s;tay, if he plea&s;ed; we &s;till could conver&s;e a little longer; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> read, or &s;ing; and then, when I awoke in the morning, I &s;hould have the dear plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him immediately. For why might he not as well &s;leep in my chamber as in his own? Oh! that I dur&s;t but tell him &s;o!&mdash;But he does not love &s;o much to be with me as I do to be with him; he pines not as I do when we are a&s;under."</P>
<P>Then would Caroline weep without knowing why; then would &s;he gaze on her little picture, ki&s;s it, repeat tho&s;e tender things &s;he dur&s;t not &s;ay to the original, com|mit it again to her bo&s;om, go to &s;leep with it, and, on the morrow, when &s;he met the Count, no more remember any thing but the plea&s;ure of being in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="034126_0220_0FFA9206DA2CB2E8">This was nearly her diurnal hi&s;tory; though, on the evening we have been de&s;cribing, &s;he was more than u&s;u|ally moved by the emotion of the Count; and, particu|larly, by his &s;udden retreat, which came &s;o unexpected, and which, by the manner of it, had produced this effect. She, then, began to reflect there was &s;omething extreme|ly &s;ingular in the conduct of her hu&s;band; &s;uch frequent inequality of behaviour, &s;o many contradictions, and cir|cum&s;tances &s;he knew not how to explain, rai&s;ed her at|tention. Was &s;he beloved, or was &s;he not? To an&s;wer this que&s;tion &s;he endeavoured to recollect every incident that had any relation to Wal&s;tein, from the moment after their arrival at Ronebourg. While thus ruminating, a &s;ong &s;he had compo&s;ed, at the time the Count endeavour|ed to avoid her, and when &s;he imagined her&s;elf hated by him, was recollected, and the recollection affected her; &s;he &s;ung it, and her tenderne&s;s was redoubled. Then it was that the Count had overheard her, unfortunately, as &s;he was ending the &s;ong, which was as follows:

<P>Had the Count heard the fir&s;t &s;tanzas he mu&s;t have known they related to him; but the latter and, e&s;peci|ally, the addre&s;s to the picture, wholly led <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> into error. His portrait it could not be; and the energy was the energy of Lindorf, who, flying, thus &s;acrificed his hap|pine&s;s to his friend.</P>
<P>As to Caroline, having &s;ung, wept, and ki&s;&s;ed her pic|ture, &s;he went to bed much relieved and more tranquil. "He loves me," thought &s;he; "I am &s;ure he loves me; but he believes he is not beloved. He remembers the repugnance which I &s;o unju&s;tly, &s;o unkindly, &s;hewed on the day of our marriage. And can he &s;uppo&s;e I &s;till am unju&s;t and unkind? But I will undeceive him, will for|get my fears, will commit all the &s;ecrets of my heart to the bo&s;om of my hu&s;band, and prove how totally this froward heart is changed. To-morrow, yes, to-morrow I am determined I will tell him all; tell him every day, and every moment that I adore him, and we then &s;hall &s;ee whether he will fly from me thus each evening after &s;upper."</P>
<P>This re&s;olution made her perfectly calm; &s;he &s;lept in peace, had delightful dreams, awaked with the pure&s;t &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure, and was more than ever determin|ed to execute the project &s;he had conceived on the over night. No more &s;he felt the &s;ame fears, the &s;ame diffidence of her&s;elf. Wal&s;tein loves her; &s;he is convinced he loves her. Doubts and recollections of the pa&s;t are the occa&s;ion of his continued re&s;erve. Unable any longer to &s;upport the&s;e, &s;he, with a word, will expel them all. Yes, &s;he will, will prove to him, by a thou&s;and incidents, that he is the &s;ole object of her affection; that he lives and reigns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingly and wholly in her heart. Poor Caroline! that heart of thine, &s;o innocent, &s;o tender, may not contain its tran&s;ports, while, in this delirium of bli&s;s, thou remem|bere&s;t it &s;hall no longer have a thought concealed from
<PB N="80" REF="034126_0222_0FFA920984761AE8">
thy beloved Wal&s;tein; from that noble hu&s;band to whom thou art indebted for thy life, and to who&s;e happine&s;s this life thou meane&s;t to con&s;ecrate. But, ah! that heart not yet knows half it has to &s;uffer!</P>
<P>Timidity is natural to youth, and e&s;pecially to youth educated as Caroline had been. The &s;uperior virtues and wi&s;dom of Wal&s;tein commanded a re&s;pect which not even the mo&s;t mild benevolence could wholly obliterate. It was therefore that Caroline had been &s;ilent &s;o long; and even now, determined as &s;he is, &s;he knows not what means are be&s;t, how to behave, or what to &s;ay; and the more the moment approaches, the more her embarra&s;&s;ment is increa&s;ed. Oh! how does &s;he regret her dear mamma, who, had &s;he lived, would, long &s;ince, have been her faithful interpreter; the voluntary pledge of her truth and tenderne&s;s! But how might &s;he her&s;elf explain them? Should &s;he write?&mdash;She began, but her emotion was too great, her hand trembled, &s;he could find no expre&s;&s;ions that could convey her feelings; no words were adequate to her ideas; &s;he could not frame a &s;ingle phra&s;e&mdash;"No," &s;aid &s;he, "it will be better to go, to run to him, to throw my&s;elf into his arms, to &s;ay&mdash;Perhaps, I may not &s;ay a word, but &s;urely he will under&s;tand my &s;ilence; &s;urely he will not be able to look at me without imagining what I wi&s;h to &s;ay; he will pardon me, will di&s;pel my fears; re&s;erve, diffidence, and doubt, &s;hall vani&s;h all; he &s;hall be wholly mine, and I wholly his; the happie&s;t of wives and of women!"</P>
<P>The thought inflames her ardour, &s;he ki&s;&s;es her little portrait to increa&s;e her courage, and flies to the apartment of the mo&s;t beloved of hu&s;bands! She enters&mdash;But no hu&s;band is there! He &s;eems not even there to have &s;lept! &mdash;A large trunk, in the mid&s;t of the chamber, in which are various other packets, &s;eems to announce a removal, or a journey.&mdash;Caroline &s;hakes from head to foot! Scarce|ly has &s;he &s;trength to ring the bell! A footman appears; tremblingly &s;he a&s;ks&mdash;"Where is my Lord the Count?"</P>
<P>The footman, &s;urpri&s;ed at the que&s;tion, an&s;wers, 'I thought my Lady had known'&mdash;</P>
<P>"Known, what?"</P>
<P>'That my Lord &s;et off betimes this morning.'</P>
<P>"Set off!&mdash;God!&mdash;"</P>
<P>'William, his valet de chambre, has been up all night, making ready. He has left orders that this trunk and
<PB N="81" REF="034126_0223_0FFA68FFDAFEDF98">
the&s;e packets &s;hould follow. He does not know where my Lord is going, but he believes to England.'</P>
<P>"England!&mdash;Leave me!"</P>
<P>The footman goes, and Caroline &s;inks in the fir&s;t chair &s;he can &s;tagger to; where, for the &s;econd time in her life, &s;he feels all the affliction, all the torture of de&s;pairing love. A &s;econd time &s;ees the man &s;he loves neglect, abandon, fly from her!&mdash;But what a difference between the pre|&s;ent and the former flight! When, at Rindaw, Lindorf left her, it was nece&s;&s;ity, it was virtue, it was her own wi&s;h; the &s;eparation was a cruel one, but the reflection that &s;he had done her duty was, indeed, the mo&s;t effective con&s;olation! Be&s;ide, &s;he knew &s;he was beloved, and that he who fled partook of all her affliction. Far different are her pre&s;ent pangs, which every circum&s;tance but aug|ments. Not a clande&s;tine lover but a beloved hu&s;band flies, in whom every hope of future felicity centres. A hu&s;band that hates her; or could he abandon her in a manner like this?&mdash;At what a moment too!</P>
<P>"Oh God! Then when I flew to him with open arms, when I imagined how un&s;peakable his joy would be; then to depart, without mentioning the lea&s;t word of his intent, without &s;eeing me once again! This mu&s;t be hatred, or a mo&s;t cruel, mo&s;t unconquerable indiffer|ence! Yet, ye&s;terday evening, how did he look at me! With what tenderne&s;s did he take my hand, and pre&s;s it to his heart!&mdash;It is true, he repul&s;ed it again with terror, and in&s;tantly left me!&mdash;For ever left me!&mdash;No, no; it cannot, it &s;hall not be. He is no di&s;&s;embler. Wal&s;tein is not the mo&s;t barbarous of all human beings.&mdash;It is er|ror.&mdash;The &s;ervant is mi&s;taken; he will return; yes, he will, he mu&s;t; and here will I wait his return."</P>
<P>Scarcely had the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Caroline indulged this momentary glimp&s;e of hope, which &s;omewhat recovered her &s;unk &s;pirits, before the footman re-entered, and brought her a packet of papers &s;ealed up.&mdash;"It comes from my Lord the Count; the courier is this moment ar|rived from Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;dam."</P>
<P>Caroline had ju&s;t &s;ufficient &s;trength to receive it, and, by a &s;ign, bid him retire. And now behold her alone, holding the packet &s;he dur&s;t not open. Life or death lies there &s;ealed up. It was large, and addre&s;&s;ed <HI>to the Counte&s;s Caroline, Barone&s;s of Lichtfield, in her Hotel</HI>&mdash;It was &s;trange this; mo&s;t &s;trange!&mdash;"What! will he not
<PB N="82" REF="034126_0224_0FFA920C2E0989A8">
call me by his name? God of Heaven! Is it po&s;&s;ible?" Her trembling fingers break the &s;eals; and, as the cover is torn, &s;he finds, fir&s;t a parchment deed, next three let|ters, an un&s;ealed open paper, on which her eyes are ri|veted.</P>
<P>Souls of &s;ympathy, that now with Caroline remain in fearful &s;u&s;pence, imagine a paper, a fatal paper, &s;igned by the King, &s;ealed by the King; imagine a deed, or ra|ther a declaration of divorce, by which <HI>the King con&s;ented to the di&s;&s;olution of the marriage of Edmund Augu&s;tus Wal|&s;tein and Caroline of Lichtfield, decreed it null and void, and the parties free to contract el&s;ewhere!</HI></P>
<P>Yes, the eyes of Caroline were riveted, wild, yet &s;hed not a &s;ingle tear! Thus, a while, &s;he &s;tood&punc; at length, the writings dropped from her hands, a dark cloud enveloped her, a cold &s;weat over&s;pread her pale face; &s;he &s;ees no more, breathes no more, a univer&s;al palpitation &s;eizes her; her la&s;t thought is a hope that the hand of death is upon her, and &s;he &s;inks into in&s;en&s;ibi|lity!</P>
<P>Thus did &s;he &s;ome time remain; and, when nature began &s;omewhat to revive, &s;he imagined &s;he had been in a fearful dream: but not long did this deception conti|nue; the chamber, the trunks, the letters, the paper were there, witne&s;&s;es of the reality of her wretchedne&s;s. She looks at the direction of tho&s;e letters. The fir&s;t is to her father, the &s;econd to Caroline, and is rejected with horror&mdash;"What can he &s;ay, while thus he murders me, while thus he him&s;elf di&s;&s;olves our union?"</P>
<P>She examines the third, and what is her &s;urpri&s;e! It is directed to the Baron of Lindorf, at Wal&s;tein-hou&s;e, Berlin; and at the bottom of the direction is written, <HI>I conjure Caroline to give this letter with her own hand, to my friend, the very moment he arrives, which mu&s;t be &s;oon</HI>&mdash;"To Lindorf, exclaimed &s;he&punc; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at his own hou&s;e! And to me the letter entru&s;ted! Oh God! Oh God! what can be the meaning of this? Lindorf here!&mdash;Could he be capable!&mdash;is he the cau&s;e of?&mdash;Oh! would to God it may be jealou&s;y! How ea&s;ily &s;hall I be able to prove it groundle&s;s!"</P>
<P>Caroline eagerly takes up the rejected letter, addre&s;&s;ed to her, opens it, begins to read, and hope revives in her heart.&mdash;No! not jealou&s;y, not hatred, not indifference, not re&s;entment are there; but genero&s;ity, delicacy, love&punc;

pa&s;&s;ionate love, tender, exce&s;&s;ive, heroic love; and in an in&s;tant Caroline pa&s;&s;es from the depths of mi&s;ery to the pure&s;t heaven of bli&s;s. "He loves me! He loves me!" &s;aid &s;he, "he loves me! and our marriage is not di&s;&s;olved! Soon &s;hall he know Caroline loves him al&s;o; will be his, and his only; will exi&s;t for him, with him, by him, and never, while life endures, will leave him more!" Ble&s;&s;ed as this letter was, &s;carcely could &s;he end it, &s;o eager was &s;he to give orders, in&s;tantly to prepare the po&s;t-chariot; but, while it is preparing, again &s;he reads, again &s;he devours its contents. The words are ho&s;ts of angels, and the &s;mall paper the infinite regions of bli&s;s.</P>

But it is pa&s;t, the charm is broken, and I feel it is time to fly. Yes, in a delirium of hope was I almo&s;t lo&s;t; but, with the fir&s;t rays of returning day, I will depart to obtain what &s;hall ever bani&s;h all &s;uch future ra&s;h hopes, to which I have too, too, weakly yield|ed.

Know that, be my mi&s;ery what it may in quitting you, in renouncing you thus eternally, it &s;till would be infinitely greater were I to remain and u&s;urp tho&s;e rights which are due to love alone.

</LETTER>
<P>Again this dear letter is read till the chariot is ready, except ju&s;t for a moment that Caroline runs into her own apartment to fetch the manu&s;cript of Lindorf; the pic|ture, that principal cau&s;e of mi&s;take, is warm in her bo|&s;om. And now &s;he departs, entreating, conjuring the po&s;tillions to be expeditious, and, notwith&s;tanding all

their endeavours to oblige &s;o &s;weet a petitioner, &s;till &s;he finds they go but &s;lowly. The Count was &s;ome hours before her, and yet, &s;o great was the diligence &s;he u&s;ed, he had not been very long at Wal&s;tein before &s;he arrived. Shut up in his clo&s;et, a prey to the mo&s;t violent grief, in&s;en&s;ible of every thing but the lo&s;s of Caroline, whom he never was more to behold, dead even to the con&s;ola|tions of virtue, he there had retired from the world, and the &s;ight of human being. A momentary gleam of com|fort had come over him when he fir&s;t was met by his va&s;|&s;als and &s;ervants. Loui&s;a, Ju&s;tin, and the aged Jo&s;&s;elin, had been at the head of them, had fallen and cla&s;ped the knees of their benefactor, had pre&s;ented their two litttle boys, and with ble&s;&s;ings and prayers&punc; and &s;miles and tears, had given him &s;alutation. Loui&s;a was pregnant again, "Oh! my Lord," &s;aid &s;he, "your arrival is the fore|runner of happine&s;s. I &s;hall have a little girl, for which &s;o often I have prayed; and now my Lord is married, if my Lady the Counte&s;s will but have the goodne&s;s to &s;tand Godmother, and let my child be chri&s;tened after her, I &s;hall never be thankful enough for the favour."</P>
<P>The grateful Loui&s;a &s;poke daggers! The Count could not &s;upport it.&mdash;"Alas! child, I am&mdash;I am no longer"&mdash; Wal&s;tein was obliged to break off abruptly and fly to con|ceal the bur&s;ting efforts of nature.</P>
<P>The&s;e good people &s;till were a&s;&s;embled in the court, and with them &s;ome of the villagers, who all were la|menting the grief in which they had &s;een their good lord, when Caroline arrived. She opened the door, &s;prang from her chariot, and, without &s;eeing or hearing per&s;on or object that &s;urrounded her, exclaimed, "Where is he? Where is the Count?"</P>
<P>William flew!&mdash;"Here is my Lady the Counte&s;s!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Yes dear William, here am I! Where is he? Lead me to him in&s;tantly!"</P>
<P>William ran before her, pointed to his ma&s;ter's clo&s;et door, and retired. Caroline opens it, runs, falls into his arms, and in a broken voice exclaims, "My Lord! My Hu&s;band!&mdash;Wherefore ha&s;t thou quitted thus thy Caroline, who adores thee, who loves thee and thee only in all the world, and whom thou wilt kill &s;houlde&s;t thou abandon her?"</P>
<P>The ha&s;te with which &s;he ran, her eagerne&s;s, her &s;obs, all cut &s;peech &s;hort and interrupted re&s;piration; her head
<PB N="87" REF="034126_0229_0FFA691CAFE92AD0">
reclined on the &s;houlder of the Count, her arms hung round his neck, and her tears fell into his bo&s;om. Wal|&s;tein was not le&s;s agitated than her&s;elf; at la&s;t, taking her in his arms and placing her on a &s;opha, he falls at her feet.</P>
<P>"Caroline!&mdash;Caroline!&mdash;Is it you, Caroline?&mdash;Is it, or is it &s;ome pitying angel who has a&s;&s;umed your form? Can what I have heard be po&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"Doubt it not, doubt it not! Here, here, (Caroline untied the ribband and took the portrait from her bo&s;om) look, behold the picture I love; nay, look at it well; &s;ay who&s;e likene&s;s it is; behold who thus entirely po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es my heart, and for whom alone I would live and die!"</P>
<P>Wal&s;tein looked!&mdash;with a&s;toni&s;hment looked!&mdash;It was he!&mdash;Good God! he him&s;elf! At lea&s;t &s;uch as he him&s;elf had been; and Caroline proved &s;he &s;till beheld him as he had been, and that, to her, he had undergone no change. True it was, indeed, that he every day be|came more like his portrait, and that, at pre&s;ent, the likene&s;s even could not be mi&s;taken. But by what ma|gic, what miracle could this portrait, of the exi&s;tence of which the Count him&s;elf was ignorant, fall into the hands of Caroline, be worn next her heart&punc; and become the object of her deare&s;t her tendere&s;t care&s;&s;es? He looks, he falters; he is ready to &s;ink under the exce&s;s, and yet cannot he believe it real! It is a heavenly dream out of which he fears to awake! Few are his words&mdash;but tho&s;e few all are expre&s;&s;ive of rapture, a&s;toni&s;hment, and re|maining doubt. As &s;oon as pa&s;&s;ion would permit, Caro|line, blu&s;hing, drew from her pocket all the letters and the manu&s;cript which Lindorf had left her&mdash;"Take the&s;e," &s;aid &s;he, "read, and you will know all. No more will I have any &s;ecrets for my Wal&s;tein; they have already made me too wretched.&mdash;Yes, I loved Lindorf; at lea&s;t, I had &s;en&s;ations that bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e I feel at pre&s;ent. What the difference is you your&s;elf &s;hall judge. When Lindorf left me at Rindaw, I wept; yes, wept; and not a little; but my grief &s;oon found alleviation, &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided, and &s;oon did this &s;mall picture become dearer to my heart than Lindorf. This morning, on the contrary, I wept not, when I received the fearful &s;entence of &s;eparation. Not a tear e&s;caped: but I thought either death or di&s;traction mu&s;t have been

the in&s;tantaneous effect, and &s;hould you per&s;i&s;t in that your dreadful de&s;ign it would be as though you were to &s;ay to me <HI>Caroline, I wi&s;h thee dead</HI>&mdash;But, Oh! rather &s;ay, Caroline, I wi&s;h thee mine, and mine thou ever &s;halt be&mdash;Here&mdash;here is the paper! The&mdash;the divorce! Look how in&s;ignificant it is at pre&s;ent!"</P>
<P>It was torn in a thou&s;and pieces, and Caroline ca&s;t it with indignation into the fire&mdash;Wal&s;tein could not utter a word! He gazed, he wept, he took her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, to his heart&mdash;He gazed again, and excla|mations, without connection, without meaning, &s;ucceed|ed each other. He took up his own picture, and, in his delirium, ki&s;&s;ed it with tran&s;port! It was the &s;acred proof of the affection of his dear Caroline!</P>
<P>Caroline pre&s;&s;ed him once more to read the manu&s;cript, but this he could not: this would have been to have ta|ken his eyes off her, and have robbed him&s;elf of moments the mo&s;t precious, the mo&s;t ec&s;tatic the human heart knows.&mdash;"No, dear Caroline, do not, do not a&s;k me to read now. I do read, I read your heart, I there find I am beloved; and what farther knowledge can I want?"</P>
<P>"But you know not the hi&s;tory of the portrait." "No matter; I know it dear to you, and that is all I wi&s;h to know."</P>
<P>"Nay, but hear, at lea&s;t, that it was Lindorf who taught me to e&s;timate the worth of Wal&s;tein; who fir&s;t in&s;pir|ed admiration, which was afterwards productive of love."</P>
<P>"Lindorf!"</P>
<P>"Yes, let me do him ju&s;tice; to Lindorf you are in|debted for the heart of your Caroline."</P>
<P>"To Lindorf!&mdash;Generous Friend!"</P>
<P>"To you he owes every thing."</P>
<P>"No, no, I am indebted to him for more than life."</P>
<P>Wal&s;tein then took the manu&s;cript and read, and Ca|roline pre&s;ently &s;aw the &s;truggling efforts of &s;en&s;ibility; often was he obliged to &s;top, and endeavoured to &s;tifle his tears, and as often did he tell Caroline, with a broken and pa&s;&s;ionate voice, that Lindorf mo&s;t merited her affec|tion. Caroline, with her angel hand, &s;topped his mouth, and obliged him to continue his reading. He pa&s;&s;ed ra|pidly over events which were already familiar to his me|mory; but when he came to the epocha of the fir&s;t meet|ing of Lindorf and Caroline, his very &s;oul &s;eemad a part of the paper, each &s;yllable, each phra&s;e was devoured, and

he read with his eyes only, for circum&s;tances like the&s;e might not be read aloud. Caroline, with fixed looks, continually endeavoured to di&s;cover the different &s;en&s;a|tions by which he was agitated.</P>
<P>When he had ended, he gave her back the manu&s;cript in a manner that &s;hewed how much he had been moved. "I &s;ee," &s;aid he, "I have a wife and a friend &s;uch as ne|ver man had, and that they both have &s;acrificed their own felicity to mine&mdash;Ah! wherefore, Caroline, did you ob|lige me to read this manu&s;cript? Why not leave me in that ble&s;&s;ed dream into which I &s;o lately had been lulled?"</P>
<P>"A dream? Unkind Wal&s;tein! Is that an epithet for feelings &s;uch as mine? Do you forget that this is your picture?&mdash;The word picture, pronounced with the utmo&s;t affection, was convincing, and re&s;tored the Count all his confidence and bli&s;s.&mdash;"And now," &s;aid &s;he, "that you have read your own &s;tory, and that of Lindorf, li&s;ten to the hi&s;tory of my heart."</P>
<P>Caroline, then, circum&s;tantially, related all that had pa&s;&s;ed from the moment of their marriage: the innocence with which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he loved Lindorf as a brother, and her terror at fir&s;t imagining a lover; the &s;cene of the garden, of the pavilion, her grief, her tears, her regret, her &s;truggles, all were told. She next informed him how, induced by e&s;teem and admiration at reading his letters to Lindorf, &s;he had begun to think of him, to look at and love his portrait; &s;poke of what &s;he felt on receiving the letter in which he propo&s;ed to leave his country, and of the delicacy, the &s;en&s;ations, and the mixture of chagrin that had occa&s;ioned her an&s;wer. When &s;he came to the court-yard of Ronebourg, "I prote&s;t, I vow," &s;aid &s;he, "it was agitation only at finding my&s;elf &s;o unexpectedly in the pre&s;ence of a hu&s;band whom I had &s;o cruelly wronged, and by whom I had &s;o much cau&s;e to be hated; it was not Lindorf. No, you long had utterly effaced every impre&s;&s;ion he had made upon my heart."</P>
<P>The Count li&s;tened in rapture. He was enchanted, and took care not to give her the lea&s;t interruption. With what enthu&s;ia&s;m, what truth, what eloquence, what af|fection, did &s;he &s;peak! How did &s;he dwell on every cir|cum&s;tance of her recovery at Ronebourg, of her hopes and fears &s;ince their arrival at Berlin, and her continual intention of explaining her feelings; of the timidity by

which &s;he was re&s;trained; of her de&s;ire to plea&s;e him, to win his affection, to attach him wholly to her&s;elf, and make him happy; of her grief at her ill &s;ucce&s;s, her re&s;o|lution, that very morning, of &s;peaking, and her extreme affliction at finding him gone; of her de&s;pair at receiving the fatal packet, and of the joy that &s;ucceeded when &s;he was &s;o fully convinced, from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter, how dearly &s;he was beloved by her hu&s;band. All was expre&s;&s;ed with that rapidity, that per&s;ua&s;ion, that pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;o entirely remove doubt&mdash;"At pre&s;ent," added &s;he, you are as per|fectly acquainted with Caroline as &s;he is with her&s;elf; I have nothing more to relate, except to paint how happy I am. Oh! but how? It is wholly impo&s;&s;ible! I love, am beloved, and may, without a blu&s;h, receive and re|turn all the mo&s;t endearing proofs of love!

<P>Wal&s;tein would have replied, would have entered into explanations concerning his own conduct, but he was in|terrupted by the arrival of William.

Caroline, led by Wal&s;tein, de&s;cended into the court, and was received with redoub|led cries of <HI>Life! Happine&s;s and long life, to my Lord and my Lady!</HI>" The Count ordered wine and money to be di&s;tributed, and Caroline, cla&s;ping his hand mo&s;t affecti|onately, whi&s;pered, "The&s;e good people, my Wal&s;tein, know not that they really celebrate our bridal day, the epocha of happine&s;s confirmed!&mdash;Would you but permit&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Permit, Caroline!&mdash;Speak, command."</P>
<P>"See what a number of young people here are. Do you not think there are &s;ome lovers, among them, who wi&s;h to marry, but whom poverty keeps a&s;under? Ah! let us make them as happy as we are our&s;elves!"</P>
<P>The Count ki&s;&s;ed her hand with tran&s;port.&mdash;"Dear, adorable Caroline!&mdash;Let us do &s;till more; let us perpe|tuate the memory of this fortunate day, &s;ince it is the day when Caroline is given to my arms. Let us, here, in this &s;cene of bli&s;s, annually be&s;tow &s;ix marriage portions, and do thou, my Caroline, inform the good pea&s;ants of the in&s;titution."</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="034126_0233_0FFA691F97F03838">Caroline again pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Wal&s;tein, &s;poke to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he people, and new acclamations, new benedictions were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttered with redoubled fervency: in the mid&s;t of the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umultuous tran&s;ports, the voices of young lovers were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">till louder and more ardent than the others, and their prayers that God might for ever ble&s;s their good Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Lady reached the &s;kies!</P>
<P>Wal&s;tein, perceiving Loui&s;a and Ju&s;tin in one corner&punc; of the court, with their little family, called, and pre&s;ent|ed them to Caroline. "Here, my love," &s;aid he, "are &s;ome good people with whom you are already acquaint|ed." "Ah!" &s;aid Caroline, "this is the beauteous Lou|i&s;a."&mdash;Loui&s;a blu&s;hed and became more beautiful; for, though childbearing and the duties of her &s;tation had &s;omewhat faded the ro&s;es on her cheeks, &s;he &s;till was ex|ceedingly hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>"Oh! yes, my Lady," &s;aid Ju&s;tin, with his open ex|pre&s;&s;ive countenance, which at once be&s;poke the capacity of his mind and the hone&s;ty of his heart: "You are ve|ry right; this is my beauteous Loui&s;a; there's not a man in the world, it's my opinion, has &s;o hand&s;ome a wife, except my Lord the Count; and that is but ju&s;t. It is the recompen&s;e of Heaven for having be&s;towed Loui&s;a on the poor Ju&s;tin."</P>
<P>It was now Caroline's turn to blu&s;h! She care&s;&s;ed the two boys, who were fine little fellows, and, perceiving the pregnancy of Loui&s;a, prevented her petition, by of|fering, of her own accord, to &s;tand god-mother to the child. Loui&s;a would have knelt at her feet, if Caroline would have &s;uffered her: but Ju&s;tin nothing could re|&s;train; he ki&s;&s;ed the hem of her robe, and, ri&s;ing, &s;aid, "Surely God loves me, for he hears and grants me all my prayers! No&punc; &s;ooner did I a&s;k him to give me Loui&s;a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he put it into the heart of my Lord to make her mine&punc; and then I again begged a Loui&s;a for my Lord&punc; and be|hold he has found one! Well then, I next will pray him to grant my Lady two little boys, as hand&s;ome as ours; nay and I have no doubt but they will &s;oon be here."</P>
<P>Caroline turned away, &s;tooped to the children, and gave each of them a ki&s;s and a ducat, while Wal&s;tein af|fected, &s;hook Ju&s;tin by the hand, and threw his pur&s;e in|to his hat. To e&s;cape thanks and prevent the efforts of gratitude, which, when beyond expre&s;&s;ion, are always painful, he a&s;ked Caroline to walk in the garden&punc; to which
<PB N="92" REF="034126_0234_0FFA92199A620358">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he in&s;tantly agreed. It was then the month of Decem|ber, the air was piercing, the earth covered with &s;now, and the waters with fro&s;t, yet neither fro&s;t nor &s;now were &s;een, nor was the &s;harp air felt by Caroline and Wal&s;tein. Never did walk in &s;pring appear to them &s;o delicious. Long has it been known that love can embelli&s;h all things, and that, where the beloved object is pre&s;ent, their is nei|ther winter nor &s;ummer, &s;pring nor fall. Indeed, the gardens, were remarkable for their beauty, extent, and the ta&s;te with which they were di&s;po&s;ed; and, as &s;uch, were vi&s;ited by travellers. Caroline had &s;een &s;omething of them, on her other bridle day, and perhaps more than &s;he &s;aw at pre&s;ent, though &s;he now walked all over them.&mdash; At length, the Count, fearing the effect of the cold, brought her back to the Chateau. Here they found a collation &s;uch as the ru&s;tic hoards of Loui&s;a could afford. She had been bu&s;y in providing cream, new chee&s;e, che&s;|nuts, honeycombs, and a part of the kid that Ju&s;tin had killed. "How fortunate it was," &s;aid Loui&s;a, "that I had it ready dre&s;&s;ed to regale our good old father!"</P>
<P>"What Jo&s;&s;elin!" cried Caroline; "nay then, Loui&s;a, you mu&s;t go and bring him to eat with us." Loui&s;a ran to &s;eek him, and in the Sire came, &s;upported by Ju&s;tin, and tremulous &s;till more with joy than old age. The Count and Caroline ro&s;e, both went to him, and each tak|ing him by an arm placed him in a great chair; after which the Count, filling him a bumper, &s;aid, "Drink this, my brave Jo&s;&s;elin, to the health of the happie&s;t of mortals!"</P>
<P>"And this," &s;aid Ju&s;tin, "to him who well de&s;erves to be the happie&s;t!"</P>
<P>Jo&s;&s;elin would have &s;poken, but he was &s;o much affec|ed he could only utter parts of &s;entences, and rai&s;e his hands and eyes to heaven. After, however, having drank a third gla&s;s to the health of my Lady the Counte&s;s, and after a long look at her, he &s;uddenly exclaimed&mdash;"Ble&s;|&s;ed be God for having made &s;o beauteous a Lady purpo&s;e|ly for our good Lord! Oh yes! you are beautiful, madam, and very, very good! I can &s;ee, I am &s;ure you are; but you have an angel for a hu&s;band! Did you know what he has done for us, how he pre&s;erved, how he provided for, my Loui&s;a!"</P>
<P>And now the good Jo&s;&s;elin, animated by wine, and having once begun to &s;peak, was not willing to be &s;ilent. He recounted the whole hi&s;tory, to Caroline, of the mar|riage
<PB N="93" REF="034126_0235_0FFA6925C40E9EB8">
of his daughter; and how he would not hear of Ju&s;tin, and how my Lord the Count came round him, and how he gave them a good farm, and fifty ducats down, and how he had the misfortune to wound him &s;elf as he went from their hou&s;e, and how they carried him on hur|dles to the Chateau of Ronebourg; and a thou&s;and other <HI>hows</HI> which Caroline knew as well as he, yet would &s;he not interrupt him; the plea&s;ure the old man felt in talking was a plea&s;ure to Caroline; nay, &s;he even li&s;tened with delight to this &s;imple but natural village eloquence; it flowed pure from the heart, and never thought of well-placed words or &s;tudied expre&s;&s;ions; and particularly to the prai&s;e of Wal&s;tein which was ince&s;&s;antly repeated, and which drew the &s;weete&s;t tears of &s;en&s;ibility to her eyes. She looked up to this dear, this beloved hu&s;band, and &s;aw his heart in &s;ympathy with hers; &s;he &s;tretched out her hand to him with a &s;oft &s;mile, an expre&s;&s;ion which no words can convey. Love, virtue, and happine&s;s were united, and this &s;ingle moment would have been a large compen&s;ation for an age of pain.</P>
<P>Jo&s;&s;elin drank, talked, and became more and more animated. He &s;poke of his hou&s;e, his family, the care his children took of him, of his dear Ju&s;tin, who was the be&s;t of &s;ons, of hu&s;bands, and of fathers. "An it were to do again," &s;aid he, "I would give him my Loui&s;a if he were not worth a groat. Not, my Lord, that your bounty has done any harm. And then when I &s;ee the&s;e two little urchins, playful, capering round me&mdash; Ah! how does it rejoice my very heart! It makes me young again; and if my dear Cicely were &s;till living, I &s;hould be happier now than ever&mdash;But, pray, my Lord, what is become of our ma&s;ter's &s;on, the young Baron of Lindorf? I can remember him le&s;s than either of the&s;e. Many a time have I had him in my arms: nay, I am his nur&s;e father, and &s;hall always love him. I was told he was going to marry the &s;i&s;ter of my Lord, and right glad we were to hear it; for &s;uch honourable noble &s;ouls ought to marry. Is it true, my Lord? Is he your brother?"</P>
<P>"Not yet," &s;aid Caroline, ri&s;ing, and returning Lou|i&s;a's younge&s;t boy to his other, whom, till then, &s;he had held in her lap. Ju&s;tin and Loui&s;a under&s;tood by this it was time to retire, and Loui&s;a hinted as much to her father; but the old man was &s;o happy, in his arm chair, with the Count, the Counte&s;s, and the bottle, that he
<PB N="94" REF="034126_0236_0FFA921C4F211BA0">
could by no means re&s;olve to leave them. "Let me alone, my child," &s;aid he, "it is the happie&s;t day I ever beheld, and, at my time of life, one has not much hap|pine&s;s to lo&s;e."&mdash;"But we are trouble&s;ome, father," &s;aid Loui&s;a, "to my Lord the Count."&mdash;"Not in the lea&s;t, I tell thee; thou art a fooli&s;h girl; I know him better than thou do&s;t; why it is his delight to &s;ee others happy: is it not, my Lord? Am not I right and is not &s;he wrong? But our children, now-a-days, will be wi&s;er than their fathers."</P>
<P>Wal&s;tein &s;miled, and Caroline again &s;at down, and made a &s;ign to Loui&s;a; while the old man, more happy than a monarch, began to &s;ing. He could not fini&s;h his &s;ong. "So it is," &s;aid he, "I am good for nothing now; but I have a heart for all that. Ah! madam, if you had but heard me give the word of command! But come, &s;on Ju&s;tin, it is now thy turn. Where is thy flageolet? Play madam a tune. Loui&s;a &s;hall &s;ing, and the little apes here &s;hall dance. P&s;haw, what &s;impletons you are! you think of nothing: an it were not for me, here would you leave my Lord and Lady to yawn them&s;elves to &s;leep."</P>
<P>Caroline having &s;ignified &s;he really &s;hould be glad to hear Ju&s;tin play, he took out his flageolet and played &s;ome allemandes, to which the little ones danced with much more grace and meaning than could have been ex|pected, while their mother watched every motion, and the old man chuckled as he looked at the Count and Counte&s;s. "Did not I tell you," &s;aid he, "it was worth your &s;eeing? And now, Loui&s;a, do thou &s;ing the &s;ong thy hu&s;band made a few days ago."</P>
<P>"How! cried Caroline; "is Ju&s;tin a poet too!"</P>
<P>"No, Madam, no poet," &s;aid Ju&s;tin: "I only write a couplet now and then for my Loui&s;a." He then play|ed a wild plea&s;ing melody, by way of &s;ymphony, on his flageolet, and Loui&s;a, with the timid &s;implicity and &s;weet|ne&s;s of the village voice, &s;ung as follows.</P>

<P>Loui&s;a ended, and Ju&s;tin laid down his flageolet.

<P>Ju&s;tin &s;ung with as much feeling as he wrote, and the Count and Caroline, aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted and a&s;toni&s;hed at his talents, gave him all the prai&s;e he merited. The mode&s;t and the &s;imple Ju&s;tin &s;aid it was Loui&s;a who had taught him every thing, for had it not been for the plea&s;ure he took in plea&s;ing her, he &s;hould have known nothing.

<P>"Would to heaven he might!" an&s;wered the Count; "but you forget, my love"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"That it is not Matilda, now, who could make Lin|dorf happy?"</P>
<P>"And why not?"</P>

<P>"Lovely, adorable Caroline!" cried the Count, "how well thou knowe&s;t my heart!

While &s;he was la&s;t at Berlin, her mourn|ing and her health were &s;ufficient pretexts to obtain de|lay, and the Count, we have &s;een, had his rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to indulge her in this delay. At pre&s;ent, he per|ceived
<PB N="98" REF="034126_0240_0FFA9222C15BE680">
her inquietude, and &s;topped &s;hort; but &s;he im|mediately recovering her&s;elf, an&s;wered with an enchant|ing &s;mile, "It is high time my Lord, is it not, I &s;hould no longer remain childi&s;h?&mdash;Well, lead me, take me to him; I will kneel at his feet; I &s;uppo&s;e he will &s;cold me; he will do very right; for I have well de&s;erved his anger; but, when he has ended, I, however, will &s;cold him in my turn."</P>
<P>"You! my angel."</P>
<P>"Yes, I; and very &s;everely, too, for having &s;igned that dreadful paper, this morning."</P>
<P>Each word Caroline uttered tran&s;ported the Count with happine&s;s and love, even to intoxication, di&s;pelling every &s;hadow of remaining doubt, if doubt might remain after the frank and natural manner in which &s;he had &s;poken of Lindorf, and her de&s;ire to &s;ee him and Matilda united. But, no, Wal&s;tein had no doubts; the ingenuous and affectionate Caroline knew not di&s;&s;imulation; &s;he expre&s;|&s;ed her feelings too forcibly, and with a conviction that deceit cannot a&s;&s;ume. Had &s;he been &s;ilent, indeed, her eyes, her &s;miles, the plea&s;ure painted in her countenance, would all have &s;poken: her lips knew not fal&s;ehood, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her features were the organs of a pure and angelic &s;oul. When Caroline &s;aid <HI>I love,</HI> no prote&s;tations, no vows, were wanting; and this &s;he had &s;aid &s;o often, during the cour&s;e of that fortunate, that bli&s;sful day, that the Count might well remain per&s;uaded of her truth.&mdash;They &s;upped on the kid that Ju&s;tin had killed &s;o a propos; for the Count, when he &s;et off for this e&s;tate, was too deeply af|flicted to think of food; and this &s;imple repa&s;t was the mo&s;t delicious either of them had ever made. Our hi&s;|tory does not inform us, whether long habit made the Count, as u&s;ual, leave Caroline's apartment after &s;upper; the reader mu&s;t, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e what he plea&s;es on the &s;ubject; but in the morning Caroline made the Count promi&s;e they &s;hould &s;oon return to this charming e&s;tate; for, added &s;he, with a &s;oftened voice and downca&s;t eyes, "I &s;hall love it as long as I live!"</P>
<P>In proportion as they drew near to Pot&s;dam, the fears of Caroline augmented: this the Count perceived, and endeavoured to in&s;pire her with fortitude. He related a thou&s;and traits of the King's goodne&s;s to him, "who," &s;aid he, "is more than my King, he is my friend. Yes, dear Caroline, it is to my friend I am going to pre&s;ent
<PB N="99" REF="034126_0241_0FFA693448BC2520">
one who will make life a continued dream of felicity, and one whom I received from him&s;elf. Had you heard him ye&s;terday morning, how long he per&s;i&s;ted to refu&s;e the cruel favour I came to beg, and when, at la&s;t, he yielded to my per&s;ecutions and &s;igned that fatal paper, had you &s;een him return it to me, you would have no fears.&mdash; 'Reflect, think again dear Wal&s;tein,' &s;aid he. 'I am truly grieved at your determination. I wi&s;hed to make you happy, and &s;till I think you might be &s;o; it is with infinite regret I have &s;igned the paper, and I &s;incerely hope you will make no u&s;e of it.' Such, Caroline, is the monarch who &s;oon is to be a witne&s;s of the felicity of his friend."</P>
<P>By this time they were in the court of the palace, and the Count, alighting, le&s;s Caroline in the carriage. The King, according to his cu&s;tom, was mounting his hor&s;e to ride round the fort and exerci&s;e his troops. He per|ceived Wal&s;tein and &s;topped&mdash;"Ah! are you there, Count?" &s;aid he; "I am glad to &s;ee you; I thought of you all day ye&s;terday, and, though I &s;aw the High Cham|berlain, did not mention a word of what has pa&s;&s;ed. Do not be ra&s;h, let me, my&s;elf, &s;peak to Caroline. I &s;carcely can con&s;ent&mdash;"</P>
<P>"My gracious Sovereign, &s;he is here!"</P>
<P>"Who?"</P>
<P>"Caroline! My wife! My lovely, my adored wife! The wife your Maje&s;ty be&s;towed on me, and who is now more beloved, more dear than ever!"</P>
<P>"Are you in your &s;en&s;es, Wal&s;tein?"</P>
<P>"Perfectly, Sir; it was ye&s;terday morning that I was frantic; but Caroline has re&s;tored me to rea&s;on, life, and bli&s;s! She loves me, wi&s;hes to be mine, and once more I throw my&s;elf at your Maje&s;ty's feet to beg her as the greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings your royal bounty could grant!"</P>
<P>Yes, the Count was kneeling to the King; who, him|&s;elf, not perfectly under&s;tanding how a woman might be the cau&s;e of all this delirium, laughed, bade him "ri&s;e and explain." The Count obeyed; related the de&s;pair of Caroline, her arrival at Wal&s;tein, their pre&s;ent intend|ed journey to Dre&s;den, for which he now a&s;ked the King's permi&s;&s;ion, and, afterwards, earne&s;tly entreated his Maje&s;ty's confirmation of their union before their de|parture. Both were willingly granted, and the Monarch him&s;elf went up to Caroline, who was &s;till waiting in
<PB N="100" REF="034126_0242_0FFA9224A38CFF78">
her carriage till the Count's return. She was a great deal affected at &s;eeing the King approach, and would have de&s;cended from the coach, but the King &s;aid to her,&mdash; "Stay where you are, Lady Wal&s;tein, &s;tay where you are; all is well; forget what is pa&s;t. I am &s;atisfied, live happy, and let me have as many &s;ubjects as po&s;&s;ible like your&s;elves. Wal&s;tein, make no delay, depart, return as &s;oon as you can, and bring with you the lovely Matilda." His Maje&s;ty then took the Count by the hand, &s;aluted Caroline, and left them both exceedingly moved by this benevolent conde&s;cen&s;ion, which Kings are &s;o &s;eldom di&s;po&s;ed to be&s;tow. They &s;et off immediately for Berlin, made preparations for their journey, and were &s;oon on their road to Dre&s;den, anticipating, the mutual plea&s;ure the meeting with Matilda would occa&s;ion. The Count fore&s;aw many difficulties which might ari&s;e from his aunt and young De Za&s;trow, but was determined to overcome them all, and bring Matilda to Berlin. He concealed his fears from Caroline, who&s;e hopes ran high, and hap|pine&s;s was great, in thinking &s;he &s;hould gain a &s;i&s;ter and a friend. We have before related how de&s;irous &s;he was of a ble&s;&s;ing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and &s;o precious; and to have the &s;i&s;ter of Wal&s;tein for this friend, with whom &s;he might conver&s;e, while he was ab&s;ent, of all her pa&s;t and pre&s;ent feelings, certain of being heard with an intere&s;t almo&s;t equal to her own was to double this ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>To love is not &s;ufficient; friend&s;hip, to whom love may unbo&s;om it&s;elf, is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary: and Caroline, already, felt the delicious tran&s;ports of telling Matilda how dearly &s;he loved her brother. In this their impatience, for the Count was as de&s;irous as Caroline of being at Dre&s;den, they travelled the two fir&s;t days with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, making no &s;tay, by day, except to change hor&s;es, and at night only taking two or three hours repo&s;e. But the &s;trength of Caroline by no means equalled her wi&s;hes, and the &s;econd evening &s;he found her&s;elf &s;o fatigued, &s;he was was obliged, when they came to a &s;mall village, to entreat the Count would go no farther that night. Wal|&s;tein, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, readily con&s;ented; but, &s;u&s;pecting the accomodations would not be very good, he &s;ent a &s;ervant before to procure a bed. At la&s;t they were met, at the end of the village, by the &s;ervant, with the landlord of a &s;mall indifferent inn. Our ho&s;t, judging by the attendants his gue&s;ts were great people, and fear|ing
<PB N="101" REF="034126_0243_0FFA693A84DDA6B8">
to lo&s;e the promi&s;ed harve&s;t, came him&s;elf, to make it the more &s;ecure. He had only two bed-chambers, each with two beds, and both the&s;e were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a young gentleman and his lady, who had arrived the evening before. The hu&s;band had a wound in his arm, which, by the motion of the carriage, had been opened; and this was likely to detain him &s;ome days longer: for which rea&s;on, to make certain of the two chambers, he had paid for them beforehand. This, however, did not much embarra&s;s our ho&s;t, who was a merry, unpoli&s;hed, country fellow.</P>
<P>"I warrant me." &s;aid he, "they will let you have one of the chambers, for what occa&s;ion have they for two? They are &s;o loving, and &s;o hand&s;ome, that they are never a&s;under all day; and why may they not as well be toge|ther all night? No, no; they will not be vexed at that."</P>
<P>The ho&s;t kept talking till they came to the inn, but the Count, however, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to go him&s;elf, and entreat the &s;trangers to &s;uffer the Counte&s;s to lie in one of the beds. Meanwhile the ho&s;te&s;s &s;hewed Caroline into her own chamber. The Count went up a dark &s;tair|ca&s;e and wanted the landlord to introduce him; but he, little u&s;ed to the forms of good breeding, led him into a kind of entry, at the far end of which was a door open, and, telling the Count he would find them there, left him to introduce him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Wal&s;tein advanced, and &s;aw a young lady at the farth|er part of the chamber, elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, and tying a black &s;carf round the neck of a young gentleman, &s;o as to &s;upport his arm. As her white and charming hand pa&s;|&s;ed his cheek he employed his other arm to &s;eize and ki&s;s it with rapture. The picture was intere&s;ting, and the Count dur&s;t not di&s;turb the young couple, whom he &s;ilent|ly beheld, remembering his own happine&s;s. Fearing to be thought rude, after &s;tanding a moment, he was going to retire; but the young lady, happening to look towards the door, &s;aw him, gazed for a moment, flew to him with open arms, and, with a&s;toni&s;hment in her countenance, exclaimed, "It is my brother! my dear dear brother!"</P>
<P>Lindorf (Yes! it was Lindorf him&s;elf!) forgot his wound, and in&s;tantly ro&s;e&mdash;"Heavens! Is it po&s;&s;ible! Can it be Wal&s;tein?"&mdash;Wal&s;tein it was, and Lindorf pre&s;&s;ed him to his bo&s;om; while Matilda, hanging round
<PB N="102" REF="034126_0244_0FFA92274D096AE8">
his neck, ki&s;&s;ed and ki&s;&s;ed, and knew not whether to weep or dance for joy.</P>
<P>Need we &s;ay the Count was a&s;toni&s;hed?&mdash;Matilda and Lindorf! His &s;i&s;ter and his friend both in his arms! Had his &s;en&s;es refu&s;ed belief his heart would have convinced him it was truth; and, though unable to comprehend by what miracle he might find two &s;uch people in &s;uch a place, he, neverthele&s;s, yielded to all the tran&s;port the prodigy in&s;pired. For &s;ome time, Lindorf! Matilda! Brother! Si&s;ter! Friend! Interjections, and exclamati|ons only were uttered, only were heard&mdash;The Count ad|ded the name of Caroline, and, at length, &s;aid, "She is here, dear Matilda, here, with me, let us go to her."</P>
<P>"Here! Caroline here! My &s;i&s;ter here!" cried Ma|tilda.</P>
<P>Light and &s;wift as the young greyhound at his return|ing ma&s;ter's voice, Matilda flies down &s;tairs and already is in the arms of Caroline, who, pre&s;ently, knew her; more indeed from her affectionate care&s;&s;es, and the repeat|ed epithet, of "dear dear &s;i&s;ter," than from the portrait of Lindorf. The gentlemen followed, and the &s;urpri&s;e of Caroline increa&s;ed; but &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure of the pure&s;t nature were her only &s;en&s;ations. Lindorf is her brother, and her friend, and &s;he he&s;itates not to ki&s;s him with that frank and natural tenderne&s;s by which true and &s;imple friend&s;hip &s;o well is characterized. "And may I, then, call you brother!" &s;aid &s;he; "may I tell you I love you! Oh! yes, I know not how much I &s;hall love the hu&s;band of my dear Matilda, and the friend of my dear, dear, dear Wal&s;tein!"</P>
<P>This open ingenuous manner would have taught Lin|dorf, had he him&s;elf been in&s;en&s;ible of, his duty. He certainly feared to meet Caroline: the &s;cenes that had &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed could not be totally ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iterated from his ima|gination; but the manner in which &s;he received him, the tone of voice in which &s;he uttered tho&s;e few words, in the pre&s;ence of Wal&s;tein and Matilda, wholly deprived him of all dread, either of him&s;elf or her. He was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find that the redoubted Caroline was no more than the wife of his friend and the &s;i&s;ter of Matilda; and for whom he felt no &s;en&s;ations beyond the&s;e tranquil and legitimate bounds&mdash;"Yes," an&s;wered he, with fortitude and enthu&s;ia&s;m, "yes, Caroline, I am your brother, your friend, the friend of Wal&s;tein, and I feel my&s;elf worthy
<PB N="103" REF="034126_0245_0FFA91E0A6E7F9E8">
of the&s;e titles, which are become &s;o dear, &s;o ine&s;timable!" Then, &s;eizing the hand of Matilda&mdash;"Dear Count," &s;aid he, "you invited me to return, and promi&s;ed me happine&s;s. Here, as the ultimate happine&s;s to which I a&s;pire, let me receive this hand, which once was promi&s;ed me from my Wal&s;tein, I think my future life will prove I know its value."</P>
<P>The Count was not long in con&s;idering an an&s;wer, and his reply was accompanied with an earne&s;t wi&s;h to hear what &s;trange circum&s;tances had united them; if they were yet married; what had occa&s;ioned the wound of Lindorf; where they were going, whence they came; and, in fine, the full explanation of what, at pre&s;ent, &s;eemed &s;o whol|ly enigmatical. We are not without our hopes that the reader, in &s;ome degree, participates the Count's curio&s;ity; and that he now imagines him&s;elf in the ru&s;tic chamber of a ru&s;tic inn, in company with four per&s;ons, the mo&s;t happy the earth contained, feeling all that love and &s;weet friend&s;hip can feel, &s;eated round an antique chimney, &s;peaking all at once, and each a&s;king a thou&s;and que&s;tions without yet waiting for a &s;ingle reply.</P>
<P>And now behold the lovely Matilda weeping and laughing both at once, ki&s;&s;ing her brother, embracing Ca|roline, holding out one hand to her dear Lindorf, and then, &s;uddenly, with a mighty grave face, and &s;erious tone, commanding &s;ilence! "Yes, &s;ilence! For one full quarter of an hour, I impo&s;e &s;ilence on you all," &s;aid &s;he, &s;eating her&s;elf erect; "for, I a&s;&s;ure you, I am not a little vain of having a &s;tory to relate. It is almo&s;t as &s;ingular," &s;aid &s;he to her brother, "as the fine tales you u&s;ed to tell me when I was a very little, little girl."&mdash; Silence being thus obtained, and the eyes of the re&s;t fixed on Matilda, &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the Count, thus began:</P>
<P>"There was a bird-catcher&mdash;"</P>
<P>"A bird-catcher!" exclaimed they all at once.</P>
<P>"Yes, a bird-catcher," replied &s;he, with great gravity. "Before I begin my hi&s;tory I fir&s;t intend to relate a little fable and put a que&s;tion to my brother. Do not be im|patient, I &s;hall &s;oon have done&mdash;There was once a bird-catcher who, by his tricks and artifices, enticed a poor little bird into his nets. Ah! how wretched was that poor little bird! How did it beat its wings in its con|finement, and call all its friends to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance! But
<PB N="104" REF="034126_0246_0FFA9229F4157F00">
the bird-catcher took care not one of them &s;hould hear its cries. At la&s;t came a linnet, and flew round the net in which it was entangled. 'Poor little bird,' &s;aid the lin|net, 'thou woulde&s;t lament &s;till louder if thou knewe&s;t all the mi&s;chief that awaits thee. To-morrow they will clip thy wings, for ever deprive thee of thy liberty, &s;hut thee up in a cage with a bird thou do&s;t not love, and forever prevent thy meeting the mate thou ha&s;t left at freedom in the groves.' Then did the little bird, at hearing this, cry &s;till louder; and the linnet was &s;o mo|ved that it &s;aid, 'Let us try if there are no means to &s;ave thee.' Whereupon they both began to peck at the threads of the net, and, crack, by and by one of them was broken; &s;o that the little bird got fir&s;t its head out, next one of its wings, at la&s;t both, &s;pread them, vaulted aloft in air and flew, right joyous, again to find its friends and former happine&s;s.</P>
<P>"And now tell me, dear brother, whether was the bird-catcher, who thus tried to deprive the poor little bird of its liberty, or the poor little bird, that endeavour|ed to regain this liberty, wrong?"</P>
<P>"The bird-catcher, my dear girl," cried the Count, enchanted at the art, &s;implicity, and grace &s;he had min|gled in her apologue. "The charming little bird will never be wrong if it appeals to me; for I am certain my heart will approve what even my rea&s;on may condemn."</P>
<P>Matilda, in&s;tantly, cla&s;ped the neck of Wal&s;tein, and with tears of joy exclaimed, "I have found my brother; he is &s;till the &s;ame, ever benevolent and ever good, and I no longer dread either his reproaches or my own.&mdash; Surely I did right in quitting tho&s;e malicious people, who made me doubt his friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Doubt my friend&s;hip! Dear Matilda, let me beg you to explain your meaning."&mdash;"Yes," continued &s;he, with vivacity, "they have had the cruelty to &s;ay, nay, even to prove, you no longer loved me, wrote to me no longer, and would &s;ee me no more: that you for|bid me to think of Lindorf, commanded me to marry the Baron de Za&s;trow, had departed for Ru&s;&s;ia, and, in fact, that I had no longer any brother, for it was the &s;ame thing."</P>
<P>Matilda could not proceed, and the tears ran down her lovely ro&s;y cheeks<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; yet, while &s;he wept &s;he &s;miled: it was a &s;ummer &s;hower which refre&s;hens nature and in&s;pires new plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="034126_0247_0FFA91E35DD58AF0">"What a child am I!" &s;aid &s;he; "I knew it was all fal&s;e; I enjoy your company, here you are, you love me, and yet you &s;ee the &s;uppo&s;ition makes me weep: but no, I will laugh; and now&mdash;there, now will I relate the full and whole hi&s;tory of the poor little bird."</P>
<P>Before &s;he began, the Count a&s;ked &s;everal que&s;tions concerning what they had told her again&s;t him, and found his aunt had intercepted and concealed the letter in which he had promi&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter &s;oon to come to Dre&s;den, and &s;et her free. She managed &s;o as to make Matilda believe the Count had written to her, his aunt. His wi&s;h that &s;he might marry the Baron de Za&s;trow was changed into a po&s;itive command, and the voyage of Lindorf into Eng|land was a love affair, and a project of marriage with an Engli&s;h lady. The letter of the Count, in&s;tead of Rone|bourg, was dated at Peter&s;burg; and the innocent Matil|da, being &s;hewn her brother's hand-writing, was the dupe of all the&s;e artifices. The arrival of the Count, it is true, would &s;oon undeceive her; but they hoped to have Ma|tilda married before that happened, and &s;ince the Count had wi&s;hed, he certainly would ea&s;ily be brought to par|don, the marriage.</P>
<P>Had Matilda been of a le&s;s determined character her aunt would, no doubt, have obtained her end; but &s;he found an oppo&s;ition, a fortitude which nothing could &s;hake. It &s;eemed inconceivable to young De Za&s;trow; for never, till then, had he &s;uppo&s;ed it po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the elegance, the graces, and the charms he had acquired in his travels. A year's re&s;idence at Paris, his acquaint|ance with certain noble and fa&s;hionable game&s;ters there, and his &s;ucce&s;s with actre&s;&s;es, who had made mo&s;t heavy demands on his pur&s;e, had &s;o convinced him of his irre|&s;i&s;tible merit, that he had imagined nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to conquer, than to appear. To his aunt he left the care of court&s;hip, and thought Matil|da had every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight to yield when he had declared, upon his honour, &s;he was as hand&s;ome as an angel; that her &s;hape was quite charming; that there was &s;omething of a French ca&s;t in her countenance: that &s;he was almo&s;t as de&s;irable as Mademoi&s;elle du The, of the Opera-hou&s;e; that &s;he &s;ung nearly as well as Mademoi&s;elle du Gazon, of the <HI>Theatre Italien;</HI> and that when &s;he was his wife, he would incontinently take her to Paris, where there was

<P>"Such," &s;aid Matilda, "is the being with whom my aunt is &s;o enraptured; to whom &s;he was determined to marry me; and of who&s;e per&s;on, wit, and pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he was continually vaunting.

"You &s;ee," &s;aid &s;he, "your brother has changed his opi|nion."&mdash;Yes, madam," an&s;wered I, "but his opinion has not changed my heart."&mdash;"Your Lindorf no longer loves you."&mdash;"And mu&s;t I puni&s;h my&s;elf for his infidelity?"

Or can he, or you, or I my&s;elf, or any other being in the world, make me forget to love him and teach me to love another?" (What did Lindorf feel as thus Matilda &s;poke!)</P>
<P>"The&s;e conver&s;ations u&s;ually ended in ill-humour. I was, by turns, &s;colded, care&s;&s;ed, flattered and menaced: and notwith&s;tanding all my firmne&s;s, was almo&s;t driven to de&s;pair. At length, I determined to write; not to you, brother, for I &s;uppo&s;ed you &s;till in Ru&s;&s;ia, and they might have married me again and again before I could receive your an&s;wer; be&s;ide I was &s;omewhat piqued at your neg|lect and &s;ilence; therefore, I &s;ay, once more, not to you, but&mdash;to Lindorf I wrote."</P>

fal&s;hoods; though many circum&s;tances led me to think he was, and I wrote. Writing was a momentary ea&s;e and con&s;olation, and though my letter remained in my pocket|book after it was written, I &s;till imagined my&s;elf le&s;s un|happy. I had &s;ome &s;mall hopes of di&s;covering if Lin|dorf really were in England, and, perhaps, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing him this letter, and you &s;hall hear on what the&s;e hopes were founded.</P>
<P>"When I arrived at Dre&s;den, Mademoi&s;elle de Man|teul, an amiable girl, but &s;omewhat older than I, had been exceedingly polite to me, and the intimacy of the family at my aunt's occa&s;ioned me to &s;ee her often. She long had lo&s;t her mother, and lived with an old gouty father and younger brother; therefore, enjoyed a liberty which ren|dered her hou&s;e and acquaintance exceedingly agreeable, and &s;he was continually, either with me or inviting me to vi&s;it her.</P>
<P>"Flattered by the friend&s;hip of a young lady of five-and-twenty, I returned her politene&s;s, and we became as familiar as circum&s;tances would permit. Somewhat ti|mid, on account of the differance of our age, which &s;he, however, endeavoured to make me forget, I, though mo&s;t de&s;irous of a confidante, dur&s;t not tell her the &s;ecret of my heart. She had a kind of&mdash;of forwardne&s;s in her manner, owing to her education, and was, likewi&s;e, mo&s;t intimate with my aunt, to whom &s;he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly paid her court; be&s;ide which &s;he had an evident partiality in fa|vour of the Baron de Za&s;trow, &s;o that I feared making an additional enemy, in&s;tead of a friend. I could with much greater ea&s;e have confided my thoughts to her bro|ther, who&s;e age was nearer my own, and who&s;e mild and manly character might render him more indulgent; but he al&s;o was the friend of the young Baron, and, indeed, rather &s;eemed to avoid than to &s;eek being alone with me, and it was not long before he informed us he was going to travel for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>"Oh! how did my heart palpitate when I heard Eng|land was to be the fir&s;t country he vi&s;ited! How then did I wi&s;h to tell him my &s;ecret, entreat him to &s;eek out Lindorf, and conjure him to take charge of my letter! But no opportunity could I find. He was too bu&s;y in preparing for his departure, and &s;eemed &s;orrowful at be|ing obliged to leave Dre&s;den and his family. I &s;eldom &s;aw him, and when I did found my&s;elf aba&s;hed. If ever

<P>"At length, this brother departed, while I &s;till was &s;eeking the means to induce him to take my letter and give it to Lindorf; and I was left in the utmo&s;t de&s;pair at having mi&s;&s;ed &s;o favourable an opportunity.</P>
<P>"One re&s;ource &s;till remained; my friend might &s;end it to her brother. But then it was nece&s;&s;ary to make a full confe&s;&s;ion, and intere&s;t her in the &s;ucce&s;s of my pa&s;|&s;ion. The better to lead to this I continually &s;poke of England, her brother, the letters &s;he would receive from him, and the dear plea&s;ure of having a corre&s;pondence with a per&s;on one loves, though I yet had not dared to pronounce the name of Lindorf. She came to me one morning, and threw a letter into my lap. "There," &s;aid &s;he; "you who think it &s;o &s;weet a plea&s;ure to re|ceive letters; I make you a pre&s;ent of that, which, indeed, ought to have been addre&s;&s;ed to you; for my brother, though he has written to me, has &s;poken only of you."</P>
<P>"Of me!"</P>
<P>"Yes, of you, little witch. You are the cau&s;e of his ab&s;ence, you have robbed me of my brother; read, read, and return it quickly."</P>
<P>"Nothing of what this meant could I comprehend; but, beginning to read, was &s;oon better in&s;tructed. The poor youth had &s;poken to his &s;i&s;ter of &s;entiments which I neither &s;u&s;pected nor could return, and for which I was much afflicted, and, therefore would not have read be|yond the fir&s;t page. But, Oh! what a plea&s;ure was I about to deprive my&s;elf of! My friend obliged me to go on, and I turned over with vexation and &s;orrow. Scarcely had I ca&s;t my eyes on this &s;econd page before I &s;aw, at the bottom, a name!&mdash;a name!&mdash;Oh! how in&s;tantly did grief give way to plea&s;ure, to joys the mo&s;t ec&s;tatic!

Gently rai&s;ing, &s;he a&s;ked me what it meant. "Matilda!" &s;aid &s;he, "my dear Matilda! Why are you thus overjoyed? What is it that thus can agitate you?"</P>
<P>"Ah! read, read&mdash;read your&s;elf," &s;aid I, pointing to a certain pa&s;&s;age in the letter; "this will be my explana|tion;" and while &s;he read, again I hid my face in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"I have had the happine&s;s," &s;aid M. de Manteul to his &s;i&s;ter, "to meet with the Baron of Lindorf, at Hamburgh, a captain of the Pru&s;&s;ian guards, and hope we &s;hall be|come intimate friends.&mdash;We have been &s;hipmates toge|ther, and lodge in the &s;ame hou&s;e. We are &s;eldom a&s;un|der, our tempers and di&s;po&s;itions accord wonderfully, for he, like me, is melancholy, apt to be ab&s;ent, and re|grets his country. Without being his confidant, I dare pronounce his heart is not more free than mine."</P>
<P>"Ah! exclaimed I, rai&s;ing my head and joining my hands, "it is not true, then, that he loves an Engli&s;h la|dy, or that he has been &s;ix months married! My heart told me it was not!"</P>
<P>"But who, who are you &s;peaking of? Do you know this Baron of Lindorf?"</P>
<P>"Do I know him!"</P>
<P>"Ay, do you know him? Do you love him?"</P>
<P>"Love him! Better than life! Beyond all thought!"</P>
<P>"And thus, from que&s;tion to que&s;tion, Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul became the confidante of all my &s;ecrets, and fully informed of my &s;ituation. I related your friend&s;hip, my dear brother, with Lindorf, and your de&s;ire to &s;ee us united; but, as one mu&s;t always re&s;erve a little of one's wealth for one's &s;elf, I did not tell her that you had changed your opinion; though I let her know my doubts and fears concerning Lindorf, which her &s;ilence &s;eemed to confirm. Yet was it po&s;&s;ible, and I endeavoured to per&s;uade my&s;elf it was true, that the difficulty of convey|ing his letters to me was the rea&s;on why I received none. My brother was no longer in his intere&s;t; he, no doubt, knew it, and that <HI>melancholy,</HI> that <HI>ab&s;ent air,</HI> his <HI>regrets

<P>"My friend had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with an evident concern, and, when I had ended, affectionately ki&s;&s;ing me, &s;aid, "My poor, dear Matilda, why did you not tell me all this &s;ooner?

<P>"I feared le&s;t you &s;hould take the part of young de Za&s;trow."</P>
<P>"Me! Oh, no! &mdash;So far from that I perfectly approve your re&s;i&s;tance, and am only afraid le&s;t you &s;hould yield at la&s;t."</P>
<P>"Never! Never!&mdash;While I live, never will I love man but Lindorf!"</P>
<P>"Add, al&s;o, none other you ought to love; for, in reality, you are as much betrothed as if actually married, and to e&s;pou&s;e another, would be guilt, perjury!"</P>
<P>"It would, it would!"</P>
<P>"But what is Lindorf doing in England?"</P>
<P>"Alas! I know not; cannot comprehend. I have not heard from him the&s;e &s;ix months!"</P>
<P>"And why do you not write?"</P>
<P>"I have written."</P>
<P>"And where is your letter?"</P>
<P>"In my pocket-book."</P>
<P>"Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul bur&s;t into a laugh. "It mu&s;t produce wonderful effects," &s;aid &s;he, "while it re|mains there. Oh! what a child you are!

<P>"Very well, that will &s;et my con&s;cience at ea&s;e; for I now &s;hall be &s;erving a per&s;ecuted, married pair. Leave the management of every thing to me. We mu&s;t gain

<P>"Oh! I cannot deceive. I have always told him, and always &s;hall tell him, I will love none but Lindorf."</P>
<P>"And what is his an&s;wer?"</P>
<P>"That he has no faith in eternal con&s;tancy."</P>
<P>"He has not! I under&s;tand him. But we will prove what women are capable of; &s;hall we not, my dear Ma|tilda?"</P>

<P>Wal&s;tein, here, &s;miled; and whi&s;pered &s;omething to Lindorf, which the latter returned with like &s;ignificance. The ladies, and e&s;pecially Matilda, de&s;ired to know what they &s;aid.&mdash;"Oh! I promi&s;e you, you &s;hall know by and by; but go on, my dear girl, with your &s;tory. You were telling us of the tender friend&s;hip of Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul."&mdash;"I was," replied Matilda, with ardour; and never, perhaps, was friend&s;hip like hers; as you would have &s;aid, had you heard her &s;peak, &s;een her eagerne&s;s, and her zeal. You would have &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;ecret he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and that her happine&s;s, not mine, was at &s;take. Every means did &s;he take to increa&s;e my fortitude. I might, perhaps, have &s;u&s;pected my&s;elf; but my friend was five- and twenty, was therefore prudent, and, certainly, would not give me ill coun&s;el. Determined, therefore, with all po&s;&s;ible ob&s;tinacy, not to yield, I waited, but not with dread, for the an&s;wer of Lindorf; per&s;uaded he would tell me truth, and, if I found I was no longer beloved, my re&s;olution was taken."</P>
<P>"Why, what would you have done?" &s;aid Caroline with vivacity.</P>
<P>"Every thing I could to have forgotten him; but, at the &s;ame time, have kept the vow I made, never to marry, never to tru&s;t a perfidious &s;ex, capable of loving twice."</P>
<P>This was very innocently &s;aid, but it was a dagger to the feeling heart of Caroline. She blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively, ca&s;t her fine eyes on the ground, half looked up at Wal|&s;tein, and, as in&s;tantly, again looked down. He &s;aw her charming confu&s;ion, enjoyed it for a moment, tenderly, ki&s;&s;ed her hand, then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Lindorf, &s;aid,

"You, my friend, no doubt, approve Matilda's mode of thinking, and, perhaps, you are right; but each per&s;on has his opinion. I think nothing can be more flattering than to be the &s;econd object of the attachment of a deli|cate and tender heart; and I &s;hould think this attachment more durable&punc; and more certain, than that of a heart that never had occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect and be aware of it&s;elf."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed Matilda; "does my brother Wal|&s;tein preach incon&s;tancy?"</P>
<P>"I do not think a &s;econd pa&s;&s;ion de&s;erves the name, and I only admit of being twice in love."</P>
<P>"Ah! No oftener?"</P>
<P>"No, certainly; no oftener," &s;aid Caroline, faintly, and pre&s;&s;ing the hand of Wal&s;tein to her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"Well, for my part," replied Matilda, "I find the fir&s;t time once too often, and that women are very &s;illy creatures ever to love, &s;ince love has &s;o many pangs for them and &s;o few for the men.

Nay, &s;he was even complai&s;ant enough to admit his vi&s;its and endure his conver&s;ations, for whole hours, to &s;erve me, and advi&s;ed me to invite him to come on tho&s;e evenings I was to vi&s;it her. "That will be the means of amu&s;ing him and not expo&s;ing your&s;elf," &s;aid &s;he; "and, likewi&s;e, of plea&s;ing your aunt. I promi&s;e never to leave you; for, indeed, there is nothing I would not do to &s;erve you."</P>
<P>"My aunt now became very good-humoured, tea&s;ed me no more, and I hoped, thus, to gain time; but it is now three days &s;ince &s;he brought me two large &s;heets of paper, commanded me to read them, &s;ign which I plea&s;ed, and left me in utter a&s;toni&s;hment. They &s;eemed like two large contracts! And was I then permitted to choo&s;e be|tween Lindorf and de Za&s;trow?

of them was what I had &s;u&s;pected, a marriage contract with him, to which nothing was wanting but my &s;ignature, and by which I was made heire&s;s to my aunt. The other was a deed of conveyance of this in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce to the Ba|ron de Za&s;trow, &s;hould I refu&s;e to &s;ign the fir&s;t.

"There, there, there!" &s;aid I; "it is done; I have &s;igned it, mo&s;t willingly." Young de Za&s;trow, as vain and &s;elf-&s;ufficient as ever, had not the lea&s;t doubt but it was the marriage contract, and, kneeling, returned me a thou&s;and thanks for my conde&s;cen&s;ion. "I am quite delighted, Sir," &s;aid I, laughing, "to &s;ee you &s;o plea&s;ed, though really, you owe me no thanks, I not having the lea&s;t merit, for I have only followed my own inclina|tions."</P>
<P>"His tran&s;ports now redoubled, and I was malicious enough to repeat, with great &s;olemnity.

<P>"I remained thus, agitated by a thou&s;and different thoughts, when Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul entered.

<P>"Kill him&s;elf, &s;illy girl! Men are not &s;o ready to kill them&s;elves. But what do you mean? Do you in|tend to keep this fatal promi&s;e? Do you recollect all tho&s;e you have made to Lindorf?"</P>
<P>"Ah! can you think I have forget them?" pa&s;&s;ion|ately an&s;wered I. "No: they are all engraved on my heart, and ere they are effaced they &s;hall tear that heart from my bo&s;om!

<P>"Why, what would you do?" &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, who &s;eemed deep in thought; "what would you do?"</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="034126_0258_0FFA614B546FDB78">"I would e&s;cape; fly to him for &s;afety."</P>

<P>"Alas!" an&s;wered I, "the thing is impo&s;&s;ible; my brother is in Ru&s;&s;ia. I never &s;hall find the means of go|ing thither."</P>
<P>"I own it is difficult; but have not you a maternal uncle in London?"</P>

<P>"What! fly to England and Lindorf there! Can you imagine&mdash;"</P>
<P>"No; I &s;hould not have imagined that would have been a rea&s;on to avoid England."</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear friend," &s;aid I, &s;haking my head, "if you have no other propo&s;al but this to offer I am undone. Rather would I go to Ru&s;&s;ia, impo&s;&s;ible as it is, and &s;eek an a&s;ylum from my brother, than to act with &s;uch impru|dence." I &s;poke this with &s;o firm a tone that &s;he offered no reply, but a&s;ked me what it was <HI>I ju&s;t had heard.</HI> I then repeated my aunt's conver&s;ation; and, &s;uddenly in|terrupting me, &s;he exclaimed, "If they have deceived you in one re&s;pect they may have in another, and, it is my firm opinion, your brother is not in Ru&s;&s;ia, for I re|collect to have heard &s;omething as well as you&mdash; I will go immediately to your aunt, and, if I am not mi&s;taken, pre&s;ently di&s;cover the truth.

<P>"She went, and it was not long before &s;he returned. Plea&s;ure &s;parkled in her eyes.

To-morrow you will be forced to &s;ign the contract; nay, they will even guide your hand, if you will not &s;ign it willingly, and the day following you are to be married.

<P>"My niece has promi&s;ed," &s;aid &s;he, "and &s;he &s;hall keep her promi&s;e."</P>

<P>"Why I really thought it would plea&s;e you to hear your brother is at Berlin, and that you may, if you plea&s;e, free your&s;elf from their tyranny."</P>
<P>"Perhaps I might&mdash;but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"But&mdash;What, and is all your courage gone &s;o &s;ud|denly?&mdash;Ah! poor Matilda! I perceive you never will have the re&s;olution to remain firm. Lindorf has got your letter, is returning, or, perhaps, returned&punc; and what will he &s;ay when he &s;hall find you are married?"</P>
<P>"Cruel friend," replied I, with chagrin; "is this your con&s;olation?"</P>
<P>"What would you have me &s;ay to a feeble and timid child, who does not know her own mind? Tho&s;e evils we want the fortitude to rid our&s;elves of we mu&s;t endure; and I can a&s;&s;ure that, in two days, if you are at Dre&s;den, you will be the Barone&s;s de Za&s;trow."</P>
<P>"Never, never," an&s;wered I, with enthu&s;ia&s;m&mdash; "Never &s;hall that hated name be mine. I will prove that this feeble and timid child has more re&s;olution than you &s;u&s;pect; nay, has enough to face even death it&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Die! p&s;haw! Who would die, when they may live, and live happily?"</P>
<P>"I &s;ee no means; it is impo&s;&s;ible. I cannot go by my|&s;elf to Berlin. I &s;hould lo&s;e my&s;elf a thou&s;and times; neither &s;hould I ever have the &s;trength to get thither."</P>
<P>"Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul could not forbear laugh|ing.&mdash;"Poor girl!

This, no doubt, would be va&s;tly cle|ver and intere&s;ting, but the way I mean to propo&s;e is much le&s;s dangerous and more &s;imple. One of my former maids is married to the po&s;t-ma&s;ter of the city. She is entirely devoted to me, and her hu&s;band will not only furni&s;h a chai&s;e and hor&s;es but drive you him&s;elf; will accompany you till you get &s;afe to your brother, and, if you plea&s;e, you may now e&s;cape, and wait at their hou&s;e till you &s;et off. You have your choice to do this or marry de Za&s;trow; for there is no alternative; you mu&s;t determine for the

marriage or the elopement; and, if you let the moment &s;lip, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;erve you."</P>
<P>"My choice is made," &s;aid I, in&s;tantly, "and, &s;ure, I am mo&s;t fortunate in a friend. I will fly to my brother, who will protect me for my Lindorf&mdash;And yet it is a great crime to deceive my aunt."</P>
<P>"Your aunt thinks it none to deceive you, mo&s;t un|worthily."</P>
<P>"But &s;uppo&s;e I were to try, once more, to move her once more&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Your trial would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain. Tears, prayers, per&s;ecu|tions, and even faintings, are expected, which, far from being moved at, they perhaps will profit by."</P>
<P>"I will be gone," cried I; neither &s;cruples nor re|mor&s;e &s;hall &s;tay me. I am &s;hamefully treated, and I have no longer any other inquietude than that which the fear of e&s;caping in &s;afety gives."</P>
<P>"Nothing is ea&s;ier. Take my gown, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k, and veil; they will &s;uppo&s;e it me, and leave me to follow you.&mdash; Wait for me at our hou&s;e, I will pre&s;ently be with you."</P>
<P>"Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul is not very &s;crupulous," &s;aid the Count, &s;miling, "You cannot imagine half her zeal," continued Matilda. "I my&s;elf was incapable of either acting or thinking; but &s;he, in a moment, got eve|ry thing ready, helped me to put on my di&s;gui&s;e, opened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> door, ki&s;&s;ed me, pu&s;hed me forwards, and &s;aid, "Go, go, dear Matilda; you have not a moment to lo&s;e: they may be coming here the next minute, perhaps; fly, or farewell all hope." Fear gave me courage, and I had got to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bottom of the &s;tairca&s;e when I recollected I ought to write a note, and leave it on my table, for my aunt; that &s;he might be certain, at lea&s;t, I was not dead. I returned, and Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, terrified at &s;eeing me, thought I had met &s;ome one on the &s;tairs.&mdash; Scarcely had I begun to tell her what brought me back before &s;he interrupted me. "You are mad," &s;aid &s;he: "Write a letter! Give your aunt time to come and catch you! She told me &s;he was coming up pre&s;ently&mdash;Be|gone, begone! They are not &s;o ea&s;y to be per&s;uaded peo|ple are going to kill them&s;elves as you are!"</P>
<P>"The fear of being caught made me compliant, and I got out without being perceived. I had not far to go, nor was it long before my friends came to me. "We have a whole hour to take our mea&s;ures in," &s;aid &s;he;
<PB N="119" REF="034126_0261_0FFA9264DD241158">
"they think you are a&s;leep, and I advi&s;ed them to leave you in peace, at pre&s;ent.

If you want any money I can a&s;&s;i&s;t you."</P>
<P>"Thanks to your goodne&s;s my brother, I did not want this kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. My friend, therefore, went with me to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the po&s;t-hou&s;e, who con&s;ented to every thing &s;he propo&s;ed, and with whom &s;he left me. It was very probable they would come to &s;eek me at the hou&s;e of Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, and, therefore, ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould be at home to avoid &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>"No &s;ooner was I alone than I began to be deeply af|fected at the terror of my aunt, when &s;he found me gone and was wholly ignorant what was become of me. Di&s;|obedience and &s;light were &s;ufficient offences, and needed not aggravation. I, therefore, re&s;olved to repair them, as far as was in my power, and, having called for pen, ink, and paper, wrote nearly thus:</P>
<P>"I have ju&s;t been informed, my dear aunt, my bro|ther is at Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and am &s;o impatient to &s;ee him that I have gone without a&s;king a permi&s;&s;ion which, in all pro|bability, would have been refu&s;ed, and have thus &s;pared my&s;elf the regret of a denial and again being di&s;obedient. I am already &s;ufficiently afflicted for having di&s;plea&s;ed you by my re&s;i&s;tance to your will. Ah! why, my dear aunt, have you forced me thus to di&s;plea&s;e, thus to refu&s;e com|plia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly from you? How happy &s;hould I have been could I have contributed to your felicity! The Baron de Za&s;trow mu&s;t have &s;ufficient delicacy to feel that a promi&s;e, extorted by terror and di&s;owned by the heart, is not binding. I hope he will no more think of killing him&s;elf, for I am no longer there to catch his arm&punc; I would earne&s;tly advi&s;e him to live, and, above all, to live happy without Matilda."</P>
<P>"I gave this note in charge to one of the landlady's children, and bade him deliver it to the porter, without &s;aying who it came from. More at ea&s;e, now I thought my aunt would be &s;o too, I waited with tolerable patience for Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, who had promi&s;ed to &s;ee me again before I &s;et off, and who, at length, came.</P>
<P>"You have not a moment to lo&s;e," &s;aid &s;he, "you mu&s;t depart at day-break; the Baron is &s;earching you through

every hou&s;e in town; he has ju&s;t left ours, and I encou|raged him to continue his &s;earch, which will give you time to get the &s;tart. It was exceedingly lucky you did not write, as your &s;illy whim would have made you."&mdash; I dur&s;t not confe&s;s I ju&s;t had wrote, but I now felt my imprudence, and the fear of being pur&s;ued was &s;o &s;trong that I was unwilling to go. My friend employed all her eloquence to encourage me; &s;he de&s;cribed the anger of my aunt, the nece&s;&s;ity I &s;hould be under of confe&s;&s;ing where I had been, and who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted me, the a&s;cendant which my elopement and return would give her over me; told me there would be no po&s;&s;ibility of appea&s;ing but by obeying her, and that, if ever I entered her hou&s;e again, &s;he was certain I &s;hould be married within two hours&mdash;"I will go," &s;aid I, "I will go in&s;tantly: the die is ca&s;t, and, be the event what it will, I will go; and accordingly orders to get the chai&s;e and hor&s;es ready were immediately given. Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, fear|ing I again &s;hould relap&s;e, would not leave me. She was under no apprehen&s;ions about her father, who&s;e gout kept him at home; &s;he &s;ent him word that &s;he &s;hould &s;up out, and remained with me till the moment of departure. Of de Za&s;trow, of my brother, of Lindorf, of every thing that might encourage me to keep my re&s;olution, &s;he &s;poke. "Depend on me," &s;aid &s;he; "I will go, in the morn|ing, to de Za&s;trow, and lead him to &s;u&s;pect you are flown to England. He &s;hall not ea&s;ily get away from me, and by that time you will be &s;o far on the way to Berlin that all pur&s;uit will be in vain." This gave me a little confi|dence; or, rather, it was now too late to li&s;ten to fear. To recede was no longer po&s;&s;ible, and I beheld the mo|ment of departure arrive with plea&s;ure. Unable to ex|pre&s;s my gratitude, except by my ki&s;&s;es and tears, while my friend was enraptured to &s;ee me, as &s;he &s;aid, e&s;cape &s;o many dangers, I got into the chai&s;e and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Alone!" interrupted the Count.</P>
<P>"No; the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, who is now with me, and who, formerly, as I &s;aid, had &s;erved Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, who&s;e hu&s;band conducted us&mdash;"</P>
<P>"But where is Lindorf?" replied the Count, again &s;topping her &s;hort. "It &s;eems that Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, not he, has carried you off."</P>
<P>"And did you think it was Lindorf?"</P>

<P>"A little patience, brother, and you will not hereafter judge of your Matilda from appearances.</P>
<P>"And now, behold me in the po&s;t-chai&s;e, with the good Marianne, for that is her name; e&s;corted by her hu&s;band, on hor&s;eback, &s;topping only to change hor&s;es, to&s;&s;ing ducats into the po&s;tillions' hats, and taking each bu&s;h for the Baron de Za&s;trow. My companion did all &s;he could to in&s;pire courage. Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul was her oracle, and &s;he, every minute, repeated "There was nothing to fear, for Mademoi&s;elle had told her &s;o." The&s;e a&s;&s;urances made me more tranquil: and, having travelled the fir&s;t day without interruption, I thought my&s;elf in perfect &s;afety. Ju&s;t, however, as we came ye&s;|terday to the po&s;t-hou&s;e I, very imprudently, put my head out of the carriage, and pre&s;ently heard a voice, I thought I knew, cry, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;he!

<P>"De Za&s;trow!" cried the Count and Caroline.</P>
<P>"Yes; De Za&s;trow, and without the help of witch|craft. What, you &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome malicious fairy has winged him through the air? Nay, to &s;ay the truth, I &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o my&s;elf, at fir&s;t; but, alas! I &s;oon found this good for no|thing fairy was neither more nor le&s;s than my own impru|dence. The note I had written had indicated the road I &s;hould take, and the Baron had not lo&s;t his time in fur|ther &s;earch at Dre&s;den. He &s;uppo&s;ed I had, no doubt, written it in the carriage&punc; and that, by &s;etting off immedi|ately, he &s;hould ea&s;ily overtake and bring me back; and this &s;uppo&s;ition made him depart two or three hours be|fore me. I imagined my&s;elf pur&s;ued while, on the contra|ry, I was full &s;peed pur&s;uing, and, unfortunately enough, overtook him at his po&s;t-hou&s;e, where he was waiting for hor&s;es. How great mu&s;t have been the &s;urpri&s;e of my dear friend, Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, when &s;he found, in the morning, he was gone! And how exce&s;&s;ive her inquietude and fears for me! At pre&s;ent, however, I hope &s;he is ea&s;ier."</P>
<P>"Yes, yes," &s;aid the Count, &s;miling, "&s;he is ea&s;y enough, never fear. But go on with your &s;tory, it is quite romantic."</P>

Something mu&s;t be done, and I thought it be&s;t to &s;peak to the Baron, to a&s;k him by what right he interrupted me, or pretended to deprive me of my liberty, and to tell him, openly, I would rather die than either marry him or return to Dre&s;den.

Then, with her head reclining on the &s;houlder of Caroline, &s;he whi&s;pered, "I hope he will not tell how I &s;prang into his arms and cla&s;ped him in mine with all my &s;trength."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, let me conjure thee, dear Lindorf, to go on," &s;aid the Count, impatiently; "p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ithee, explain by what &s;trange chance thou came&s;t, ju&s;t at the preci&s;e mo|ment, on the Dre&s;den road, and in company with the Ba|ron de Za&s;trow."</P>
<P>"I had returned," &s;aid Lindorf, "to an&s;wer, in per|&s;on, the charming&punc; the tender letter I had received at London. My being there at this moment was accidental, but I was not in company with the Baron de Za&s;trow. It was chance, or, rather, my guardian genius that brought me to the po&s;t-hou&s;e ju&s;t then. I was unacquainted with the Baron, but I &s;aw a young man of quality, impatient to obtain hor&s;es, and quite furious becau&s;e none were to be found.

that road. They an&s;wered, No, and he again began to &s;wear it was fal&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed, and again to be|&s;tow his cur&s;es on the po&s;tillions and the po&s;t-ma&s;ter. As &s;oon as I alighted from my chai&s;e, for I was going to Dre&s;den, he came up and &s;aid, "You, certainly, Sir, mu&s;t have met a young lady, alone, driving full &s;peed!"</P>
<P>"No, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you, I met no &s;uch lady; nor, in|deed, any lady that I remember."</P>
<P>"This is very extraordinary!" &s;aid he, &s;tamping&mdash; "Perhaps the note was a new trick!&mdash;Excu&s;e me&punc; Sir, for que&s;tioning you &s;o abruptly.

<P>"The misfortune is the greater," an&s;wered I, "Sir, becau&s;e you do not &s;eem that kind of per&s;on the ladies would fly." My compliment &s;eemed to plea&s;e him, and acquired me his entire confidence. He bowed, and with much &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, which he endeavoured to render mode&s;t, replied, "I own, Sir, it is not the fir&s;t time I have been told &s;o; and there have been ladies who have gone farther than telling; but you &s;ee how different ta&s;tes are; and, certainly, that of women is very often very capricious.

<P>"Beloved or not beloved," &s;aid he, "it is equal to me; he is ab&s;ent, will &s;ee her no more; if I can overtake her &s;he is mine, and &s;hall be obliged to adore me."</P>
<P>"This conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed before the po&s;t-hou&s;e, and I was amazed at the facility with which this indi&s;creet and vain young man &s;poke to a &s;tranger, as well as at his total want of delicacy, and &s;ilently approved the fugitive lady. Ju&s;t then a chai&s;e came up, full gallop, from Dre&s;|den, and interrupted us. He did not &s;eem to have the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, and looked towards it from mere curio&s;ity, till, the chai&s;e &s;topping, a lady looked out. I had but a glimp&s;e, and did not know it was Matilda, but my gen|tleman in&s;tantly exclaimed, "It is &s;he! It is &s;he!" While
<PB N="124" REF="034126_0266_0FFA615B717D99F8">
the lady drew back, exclaiming, in her turn, "It is he!" The maid bid the po&s;tillion drive on, while de Za&s;trow, with uplifted cane, threatened to knock him off his hor&s;e if he moved a &s;tep. I he&s;itated, for a moment, what part I &s;hould take. The frankne&s;s of the youth had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, laid me under an obligation; and yet I felt my|&s;elf affected for the unfortunate lady, whom they were going to marry again&s;t her con&s;ent. My fir&s;t intention was to become a mediator, if po&s;&s;ible, and to in&s;pire the terrified lady with fortitude, for which purpo&s;e I ap|proached the chai&s;e, far from imagining how deeply I my&s;elf was intere&s;ted in this adventure. As I came up I heard my own name repeated in an accent of amaze|ment! The door opened, and out flew Matilda, whom I in&s;tantly knew, notwith&s;tanding the fini&s;hed beauty, al|teration, and growth of her per&s;on! The charming Ma|tilda placed her&s;elf by my &s;ide, took me by the hand, and &s;aid, in a voice which terror and joy had rendered faint, "Dear, dear Lindorf! God has &s;urely &s;ent you to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and defence of your Matilda! They want to rob you of her, but they never, never &s;hall! She will be yours, and yours only!"</P>
<P>"No &s;ooner did the Baron hear my name than, throw|ing away his cane, drawing his &s;word, and arrogantly ad|vancing, he exclaimed, "Lindorf! What treachery is this?" Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Matilda, &s;aid "I en|treat, Mademoi&s;elle, you will go into my po&s;t-chai&s;e. I have the po&s;itive commands of your aunt to bring you back to Dre&s;den, and I dare &s;ay the Baron of Lindorf will not think proper to oppo&s;e tho&s;e commands."</P>
<P>"That we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee, Sir," an&s;wered I coldly, while I &s;upported Matilda, whom &s;o many contending pa&s;&s;ions had occa&s;ioned to faint in my arms. I gently carried her into the po&s;t-hou&s;e and laid her on the fir&s;t bed I found; then, recommending her to the per&s;ons pre&s;ents, telling them they &s;hould be an&s;werable for her forthcoming, I immediately left her, and went in &s;earch of the Baron de Za&s;trow. I found him demanding en|trance, and forcibly withheld by two or three men, who let him go the moment I appeared. We walked toge|ther to &s;ome di&s;tance, and went into an enclo&s;ed garden. "You have accu&s;ed me of treachery, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "and appearances may give &s;ome &s;mall ju&s;tification to the &s;u&s;|picion; but I a&s;&s;ure you, on my honour, that chance, on|ly,

a mo&s;t lucky one it is true, has brought me here.&mdash; When I &s;poke to you, I was ignorant both that you were my rival and that Matilda had fled. If you think this &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction, and will leave the young Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf, I promi&s;e you to abide by her deci&s;ion, and here offer you my future friend&s;hip and e&s;teem; if not, I will defend my own pre|ten&s;ions and her liberty at the hazard of my life."</P>
<P>"Defend them, then, traitor," replied he, attacking me with &s;o much impetuo&s;ity that, being off my guard, I received a wound in the left arm. It was not dangerous, and only rou&s;ed my anger; and the Baron took &s;o little care, thinking him&s;elf certain of victory, when he &s;aw me wounded, that I ea&s;ily di&s;armed him. His &s;word flew out of his hand, and as it fell, I &s;et my foot on it&mdash;"Your life," &s;aid I, "is now in my power; I am wounded and you are not: but, di&s;regarding this &s;mall di&s;advantage, I am ready to re&s;tore your &s;word, and, again, put it to the chance of victory, if you do not renounce your preten&s;i|ons to Matilda, and promi&s;e to depart for Dre&s;den, im|mediately, without &s;eeing her."</P>
<P>"He he&s;itated, and I &s;aw, by the change of his coun|tenance, my manner of acting had made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion. Pride &s;till &s;truggled, but honor, at la&s;t, was conqueror, and he pre&s;ented his hand. "Recollect," &s;aid he, "&s;ir, you have, on the&s;e conditions, offered your e&s;teem and friend&s;hip. I feel, at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall be proud of and will, therefore, endeavour to merit them, by prevailing on my aunt to confirm that happine&s;s which is ju&s;tly your due. Forget the pa&s;t, and make my peace with Matilda. I pretend only to her friend&s;hip; though," added he, with a mixture of former &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, "I am not ac|cu&s;tomed to di&s;dain; nor do I know by what fa&s;cination I &s;o long have &s;upported hers." I embraced him, &s;aid &s;he would certainly be the la&s;t cruel beauty he would find, and that, had not her heart been pre-engag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly have re&s;i&s;ted &s;o many accompli&s;hments and &s;o much merit; after which we parted the be&s;t friends in the world.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as I &s;aw him get into his chai&s;e, I ha&s;tened to Matilda, concerning whom I was very unea&s;y. Her fainting, however, was mo&s;t happily timed, &s;ince it de|prived her of the knowledge of a tran&s;action that might
<PB N="126" REF="034126_0268_0FFA615D027A4700">
have occa&s;ioned dreadful terrors. She began to recover and, looking round her, a&s;ked where &s;he was, as I enter|ed; then, re&s;uming all her accum&s;tomed grace, "Dear Lindorf," &s;aid &s;he, "and is it not a dream? Is it true that I have once more found thee, and that we never &s;hall for&s;ake each other again?"</P>
<P>Scarcely had Lindorf fini&s;hed his phra&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re he felt the white hand of Matilda upon his mouth. "Fie, fie, young gentleman," &s;aid &s;he, "I &s;ee no occa&s;ion to repeat all that pa&s;&s;ed &s;o literally. My dear brother, and my dear, dear &s;i&s;ter, do not believe a word he &s;ays. For, what if I had thought all that, can you &s;uppo&s;e I would have &s;poken my thoughts? And, even if I did, you know I was fainting. Who can tell what they do after &s;o &s;trange a meeting, pre&s;&s;ed by one lover, protected by another, and among&s;t rencounters and battles, and all this hurly burly? One may be allowed to be a little extravagant and &s;illy, on &s;uch occa&s;ions; but, at pre&s;ent, I a&s;&s;ure you, I am as prudent as"&mdash;Matilda &s;miled, with malicious plea&s;ure, on Lindorf; then, &s;uddenly cla&s;ping his hand, added, "Well then, I &s;ay again and again, every thing I &s;aid ye&s;terday: And I hope we &s;hall never for&s;ake each other more!"</P>
<P>Matilda was &s;o charming, as &s;he &s;aid this, and there was &s;uch a mixture of rapture, plea&s;antry, and confu&s;ion in her countenance, that Lindorf imagined he loved her dearer than ever he had loved woman, and expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf with &s;o much enthu&s;ia&s;m and fire that every body thought the &s;ame. Caroline was tran&s;ported, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the Count, and &s;aid, "Was I wrong when I told you how dearly he would love her?" Wal&s;tein beheld Lindorf with a&s;toni&s;hment, nor yet could comprehend, perfectly, all he heard and &s;aw. To rea&s;on and friend&s;hip he had attributed the attachment of Lindorf to Matilda; for well he recollected to what exce&s;s he had adored Caroline; nor could imagine how a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o energetic might &s;o &s;oon change its object. Yet was there every appearance of &s;incerity in his manner, and words; and Lindorf was no hypocrite. Be&s;ide, the Count was &s;o accum&s;tomed to read his thoughts that, had he been under any real con|&s;traint, it could not have e&s;caped him, and he could ob|&s;erve nothing but &s;incerity. Lindorf, on his part, gue&s;&s;ed what was pa&s;&s;ing in the mind of the Count, and whi&s;per|ed, "When we are alone, dear Wal&s;tein, you &s;hall hear my &s;tory, and your &s;urpri&s;e will then not be &s;o great. In
<PB N="127" REF="034126_0269_0FFA926FCB400140">
the mean time, do not imagine your friend has acquired a facility at feigning; or that he does not feel all he ex|pre&s;&s;es." The Count cla&s;ped his hand, and entreated Matilda to fini&s;h her &s;tory. There was not much to &s;ay, but the lea&s;t circum&s;tance was intere&s;ting to the Count and Caroline. Matilda replied, "You forget, brother, that Lindorf is the hi&s;torian, at pre&s;ent"&mdash;Lindorf thus continued:</P>
<P>"I found a village &s;urgeon to dre&s;s my wound, and hoped I might have concealed it from Matilda, as well as my conte&s;t with the Baron. I, therefore, only told her he had li&s;tened to rea&s;on, departed for Dre&s;den, and pro|mi&s;ed to appea&s;e his aunt. She was mo&s;t happy at the intelligence, and, being equally impatient to &s;ee our friend and brother, we pre&s;ently departed. The motion of the carriage, and, perhaps, the emotion of my heart, &s;oon di&s;|turbed my wound, and Matilda was greatly agitated when &s;he &s;aw the blood. It was impo&s;&s;ible any longer to con|ceal the cau&s;e, and we were obliged to &s;top here to dre&s;s it again. It was found deeper than had been imagined, and I was condemned to take four-and-twenty hours re|po&s;e. In vain did I &s;olicit my lovely partner to conti|nue her journey, and leave me in this wretched inn; no entreaties could gain con&s;ent."</P>
<P>"No, to be &s;ure," interrupted Matilda, with vivacity. "I know my duty better. Who ever heard of a heroine of romance abandoning her wounded knight, who had de|fended her again&s;t a ferocious ravi&s;her? I even thought it nece&s;&s;ary, according to cu&s;tom, to dre&s;s that wound my&s;elf, and bathe it with my tears. Did not I, Lindorf? And I hope you will own I tied the &s;carf with tolerable grace. Were not my attitude and manner affecting, brother?"</P>
<P>"The very picture of a prince&s;s of the age of Amadis."</P>
<P>"No; one of the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of the famous Galaor," &s;aid &s;he, glancing at Lindorf.</P>
<P>"It was the mi&s;tre&s;s, then, that fixed the rover," re|plied he, ki&s;&s;ing her hand.</P>
<P>"So &s;aid Galaor to every mi&s;tre&s;s, and they believed him; but I," continued Matilda, "am not &s;o credulous, and mean to put your &s;incerity to the proof&mdash;In tho&s;e times, a woman, with va&s;t <HI>&s;ang froid,</HI> commanded her lo|ver not to pronounce a &s;ingle word for two years, and he obeyed, Oh! happy age!

re&s;t and &s;ilence on my wounded hero till to-morrow, am certain to find him di&s;obedient!"</P>
<P>"Never, never," &s;aid Lindorf kneeling; "and there will be &s;ome merit in my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, for I have many things to tell my Wal&s;tein."</P>
<P>"And &s;o you would have pa&s;&s;ed a whole night in chat|tering, mean while the fever and the wound&mdash;I reiterate my ab&s;olute command! Silence and re&s;t till to-morrow!"</P>
<P>Exact obedience was promi&s;ed, though not without reluctance. The friends were both impatient to commu|nicate their &s;entiments; and particularly the Count, who was doubly intere&s;ted to find the heart of Lindorf cured of pa&s;&s;ion for Caroline, and capable of making Matilda happy. It was, therefore, agreed that, in recompen&s;e for this their &s;ilence; they &s;hould travel, on the morrow, in the chai&s;e of Lindorf, and leave the coach of the Count to the ladies. This arrangement was equally acceptable to Caroline, who was her&s;elf mo&s;t de&s;irous the friends &s;hould mutually explain their feelings, that Wal&s;tein might be convinced of the exact truth of all &s;he had told him, and inform Lindorf of her pre&s;ent love for her hu&s;|band. Matilda, perhaps, might have preferred the care of her wounded knight; but, Matilda dared not &s;ay &s;o; and her brother having mentioned &s;ending his &s;ervant to Dre&s;den, with letters for his aunt, &s;he al&s;o retired to write, both to her and Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, to whom &s;he &s;ent back the &s;ervants and chai&s;e.</P>
<P>She pre&s;ently returned with her two letters. The Count read that to Madam de Za&s;trow, approved it, ad|ded a few lines from him&s;elf, and, perceiving Matilda concealed the one &s;he had written to Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, &s;aid, &s;miling, "I &s;uppo&s;e you expre&s;s your gra|titude in &s;trong terms to your zealous friend."</P>
<P>"I expre&s;s it as I feel it; and, I think, that is &s;aying a great deal. You, who are one of the heroes of friend|&s;hip, ought, certainly, to be delighted to find &s;uch an in|&s;tance of its effects; e&s;pecially in a woman."&mdash;The Count continued to &s;mile.&mdash;"And a pray now, what is the meaning of that ironic air? What, you are incredulous? Si&s;ter Caroline, I hope you will take the part of the &s;ex."</P>
<P>"We will both take its part," an&s;wered Caroline, "and prove how capable women are of frend&s;hip."</P>
<P>"I never doubted it," replied Wal&s;tein; "my, I even believe that pure di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tere&s;ted friend&s;hip is le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

among women than it is &s;uppo&s;ed. It is a &s;en&s;ation whol|ly accordant to their gentle and tender nature; but you will forgive me for not imagining Mademoi&s;elle de Man|teul one of its models."</P>
<P>"Brother!&mdash;After &s;o many proofs!"</P>
<P>"I am almo&s;t &s;orry, dear Matilda, to rob you of that happy credulity which &s;o well proves the innocence of your heart; but, I mu&s;t own, I have &s;trong doubts con|cerning tho&s;e proofs. Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul ap|peared greatly affected; but was it for you or for her&s;elf? Was it to &s;erve a friend or to get rid of a rival? Every circum&s;tance, I think, be&s;peaks the latter."</P>
<P>Matilda was confounded. A thou&s;and little incidents were recollected, and a thou&s;and others ru&s;hed forward to prove her brother was right; yet could &s;he not in&s;tant|ly give her up, and replied with vivacity, "Surely you mu&s;t be deceived, &s;he di&s;likes, nay, dete&s;ts the Baron; &s;he was always &s;peaking ill of and turning him to ri|dicule."</P>
<P>"Right, right; to augment your repugnance. This is the very cau&s;e why I &s;ay &s;he is not a true friend. Had Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, the victim of an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion, opened her heart to you, and given you &s;ecret for &s;ecret: had you together concerted the means of avoid|ing a marriage that mu&s;t render you both unhappy, I &s;hould have faith in her friend&s;hip, and even be far from blaming her; but all this artifice at her age, is odious: &s;he only had her&s;elf in view, by prompting you to an imprudent &s;tep, which the event has ju&s;tified, but which might have been your de&s;truction."</P>
<P>Lindorf here took up the &s;ubject.&mdash;"You are too &s;e|vere, dear Wal&s;tein; be the motives of Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul what they may, &s;he has &s;erved me &s;o e&s;&s;entially that it becomes me to undertake her ju&s;tification, and I &s;ee nothing in all this but artifice which may well be per|mitted to love; be&s;ides, while &s;he was &s;erving her&s;elf, &s;he was, al&s;o, &s;aving her friend from inevitable misfortune,"</P>
<P>"No doubt," &s;aid Matilda, who took courage at &s;ee|ing her&s;elf &s;upported; "for, one day longer, and I had been forced to marry that odious Baron."</P>
<P>"And do you not perceive, my dear girl, that, I be|ing on the road, one day longer and you had been for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver freed from tyranny, without that violence which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver prejudicial to a young lady's reputation, and without

offence to an aunt to who&s;e cares you are certainly much indebted? Your only error, dear Matilda, was that of &s;u&s;pecting my friend&s;hip&punc; of &s;uppo&s;ing, for an in&s;tant, I could abandon you; and of blindly confiding in an im|prudent young lady, tho', I own, &s;he is rather to blame than you."</P>
<P>"Dear, dear brother," cried Matilda, all in tears, and running into his arms; pardon us both. Ah! how do I reproach my&s;elf for having mentioned, for having given you an ill opinion of her! But &s;o far w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I from &s;u&s;pect|ing it, that I &s;uppo&s;ed you would admire her conduct and her zeal."</P>
<P>Lindorf joined Matilda and chid his friend for his &s;e|verity. Caroline cla&s;ped Matilda to her bo&s;om, and while &s;he dried her tears, wept in concert&mdash;"Think not I wi&s;h ill to Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul," &s;aid the Count, exceedingly affected. "No, to her I owe the happine&s;s of beholding tho&s;e I love united. So freely do I pardon her, that I &s;incerely hope &s;he may marry de Za&s;trow, and will even &s;peak in her behalf to my aunt. And now, Matilda, do thou pardon me for having afflicted thee, and undeceived thee. It will be a le&s;&s;en to thee, my dear, and the la&s;t I &s;hall ever give thee; for, from this moment, I commit thy conduct and thy felicity to Lindorf. Thou knowe&s;t how ardently I have de&s;ired to &s;ee thee his.&mdash; Oh! Caroline, Oh! my &s;i&s;ter, Oh! my friend, &s;carcely can my heart contain its joys, the &s;weet &s;en&s;ations this happy moment brings!"</P>
<P>Matilda a thou&s;and times thanked her brother for his &s;incerity, and for the in&s;truction it contained; "though," &s;aid &s;he, "I &s;carcely can repent my imprudence, &s;ince it has made us all happy a day &s;ooner;" and added that &s;he would, in a po&s;tcript, let Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul plea&s;antly under&s;tand tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at pre&s;ent, &s;he was acquainted with her motives.&mdash;The Count was not at all deceived in his conjectures, for Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul had been &s;olely prompted by her pa&s;&s;ion for the young Baron de Za&s;trow, who had paid her &s;ome attentions before he went on his travels, and who, &s;he hoped, would have married her on his return. The arrival of Matilda at Dre&s;den, the wi&s;hes of her aunt, the attachment of the young Baron to the amiable &s;pou&s;e de&s;tined him, all re|pelled hopes which the confidence of Matilda once more animated. She had only &s;ought her friend&s;hip to have

an opportunity of &s;eeing the Baron revive his former &s;entiments, di&s;cover tho&s;e of Matilda, and, if po&s;&s;ible, turn them towards &s;ome other object. At fir&s;t &s;he had had her brother in view, and, therefore, had &s;hewn Ma|tilda his letter&punc; but her joy was exce&s;&s;ive when &s;he learn|ed this lover already exi&s;ted, and that her young rival was determined on the mo&s;t peremptory re&s;i&s;tance. This it was her advantage to encourage all in her power; but this alone was not &s;ufficient; the be&s;t means of obtaining her own end, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, would be to remove Matilda from Dre&s;den. This might be&s;t be done by engaging her to take &s;ome &s;tep which &s;hould ab&s;olutely break off the in|tended match. She it was who per&s;uaded Madam de Za&s;trow, and her nephew, that, by terrifying Matilda, they might obtain her con&s;ent; and what the con&s;equence of this terror and the &s;ucce&s;s of her &s;chemes were, has al|ready been &s;een. Yet was &s;he but little benefited by her artifice, for the young Baron, recognizing, in the po&s;t-chai&s;e, the former maid of Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, and being convinced &s;he had favoured Matilda's flight, was irritated at the perfidious trick that had been played him. But this perfidy was the con&s;equence of affection! and when the vanity of man is flattered, he is generally in|dulgent.</P>
<P>Return we to our happy travellers. The wound of Lindorf healed apace, &s;o excellent a bal&s;amic is happine&s;s, and they &s;et off for Berlin; Caroline and Matilda in one of the carriages, and the two friends in the other. Leave we the&s;e lovely ladies to &s;peak of tho&s;e they held mo&s;t dear, to congratulate each other, to form plans of future delight, and to vow eternal friend&s;hip. Leave we them frequently to look out of the carriage after the po&s;t-chai&s;e that followed, wi&s;hing impatiently to arrive, and let us examine how Wal&s;tein and Lindorf pa&s;&s;ed their time.</P>
<P>They partook of the impatience we have mentioned; but man feels not &s;o &s;en&s;ibly tho&s;e &s;hort privations which are &s;ubjects of &s;uch real unea&s;ine&s;s to the tender heart of woman. Perhaps, on great occa&s;ions, the former may be more ardent, more pa&s;&s;ionate, more capable of ri&s;king every thing for the object of their love; but the daily proofs, the intervening fears, and all the &s;hades of a de|licate and con&s;tant pa&s;&s;ion, are much more peculiar to women; few men are &s;u&s;ceptible of them, nay, few know their value. Our travellers, indeed, had not time to
<PB N="132" REF="034126_0274_0FFA923272903AA8">
think of them; yet had they been in the chai&s;e &s;ome time without entering into any conver&s;ation. They &s;at &s;ilent, for Lindorf knew not where to begin, or what to &s;ay to the hu&s;band of Caroline, and the Count feared le&s;t the mo&s;t trifling que&s;tion might bear the a&s;pect of reproach: he, however, was the fir&s;t to &s;peak, and told his friend how much he had been afflicted by reading the manu|&s;cript he had left with Caroline. "I have not the lea&s;t fear or &s;cruple," &s;aid he, in confiding the happine&s;s of a &s;i&s;ter to the man to whom I am &s;o infinitely indebted, and who, loving and beloved by the mo&s;t angelic woman the world contains, could not only &s;acrifice his own pa&s;&s;ion, but endeavoured to in&s;pire her with the love of another. Ah! dear Lindorf," &s;aid he, "while to you I owe the heart of Caroline and the felicity of Matilda, is it po&s;&s;ible I ever can acquit my&s;elf of the wondrous debt? Yet &s;peak, explain how this &s;udden revolution in your affec|tions, which yet I under&s;tand not, has happened.

<P>"Dear Wal&s;tein," interrupted Lindorf, in&s;tantly, "I would utter oaths if I did not know the word of your friend were &s;ufficient. Believe that friend, then, when he a&s;&s;ures you he is worthy of becoming your brother; and that nothing has he expre&s;&s;ed that he has not felt. I love Caroline, no doubt, but it is as I love her hu&s;band, with friend&s;hip as pure and &s;trong as it is durable; but I love my dear Matilda as the &s;ole woman on earth who now can make me happy&mdash;You are &s;urpri&s;ed, but hear what I have to &s;ay.

<P>The Count was mo&s;t de&s;irous to hear, and &s;at attentive while Lindorf thus continued:
<LETTER>
<P>"Since you have read my manu&s;cript, Wal&s;tein, you are informed of my fir&s;t acquaintance with Caroline, and what were the &s;entiments &s;he in&s;pired. I &s;hall attempt no ju&s;tification of my&s;elf. You can judge whether it be po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee her with indifference. I prote&s;t, however, before heaven, that notwith&s;tanding all her beauty, all her charms, &s;he would have been totally indifferent to me had I had the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion &s;he was your wife.

Ignorant in my guilt, I offended the man for whom I would willingly have &s;acrificed my life; he has &s;een &s;ome faint picture of my grief, my remor&s;e, and the re&s;olution I took, the in|&s;tant I di&s;covered my crime, to fly. I thought I might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, repair the involuntary wrong I had done by &s;hewing Caroline who and what the hu&s;band was &s;he fled. I knew her &s;oul congenial to yours, capable of e&s;timating its worth, and that you were formed to admire and adore each other."</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>"It was thy noble friend&s;hip," exclaimed the Count, "which alone could draw me with &s;uch noble features and &s;uch colours as could affect the heart of Caroline. Yes, dear Lindorf, to thee alone I owe that heart and all the ex|qui&s;ite felicity I enjoy. No, had it not been for that pa&s;|&s;ion with which thou &s;o continually reproache&s;t thy&s;elf, Caroline, perhaps, never had loved me. But go on, dear friend, I long to be convinced thou art equally happy, and that thou thinke&s;t Matilda a proper recompen&s;e for the &s;ublime efforts thou ha&s;t made to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion which could dictate the manu&s;cript thou lefte&s;t at Rin|daw and bani&s;h thee from Caroline."</P>
<P>"I left her," replied Lindorf, "determined never to &s;ee her more, till by wholly &s;ubduing my fatal pa&s;&s;ion, I were worthy her and you; and far was I from fore&s;eeing this bli&s;sful moment was &s;o near. The &s;olitude of Rone|bourg augmented my love and gloomy melancholy; in|ce&s;&s;antly did fancy tran&s;port me to the pavilion of Rin|daw, ince&s;&s;antly was Caroline pre&s;ent. I &s;aw her, heard her, conver&s;ed with her, and when the &s;weet illu&s;ion va|ni&s;hed, de&s;pair and remor&s;e acquired additional &s;trength, and they were tried to the utmo&s;t by your arrival and conver&s;ation. You loved Caroline, your happine&s;s de|pended on being beloved by her, and again I renewed my vow of &s;urmounting my pa&s;&s;ion; or, rather, of for&s;a|king my country, and carefully concealing from you I had been your rival. This vow had been held &s;acred; never had the name of Caroline e&s;caped my lips had not &s;he, like an apparition, appeared at Ronebourg, the oc|ca&s;ion of which I yet under&s;tand not, and deprived me

of rea&s;on. Excu&s;e me from de&s;cribing all I felt while I thought I beheld her dying, but imagine what it mu&s;t be when it could make me betray the &s;ecret of my heart, and inform you that a friend, towards whom you had acted with &s;uch magnanimity, was the guilty lover of your wife!</P>
<P>"My determination was to take vengeance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n my&s;elf, and follow her whom I thought dead; but &s;igns of return|ing life prevented me: &s;he was re&s;tored to you, and I wi&s;hed not to interrupt your happine&s;s by the horrid &s;pec|tacle of &s;uicide. I went into my room, wrote the letter you found, mounted my hor&s;e, and rode full &s;peed, with|out knowing whither I went, or taking &s;o much as a &s;in|gle &s;ervant with me. The fir&s;t day I &s;uffered my hor&s;e to take which road he plea&s;ed, and, at night, &s;topped at a wretched inn; I endeavoured, however, to collect my ideas, and re&s;olved to follow my fir&s;t intention, which was to go to England. I had written to court and obtain|ed permi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e, my &s;ervant and baggage might &s;oon follow, and I immediately took the road to Hamburg where I meant to embark. I rode po&s;t day and night, and this continual change of &s;cene corre&s;ponded with the agitation of my &s;oul to which repo&s;e was in&s;up|portable. I wi&s;hed to find a ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;ail to Ham|burg, and to &s;tep into it as I got out of my chai&s;e; but, happily, there were none ready. Some hours after my arrival, I was &s;eized with a burning fever, which la&s;ted &s;everal days; the phy&s;ician, whom my ho&s;t called in, had m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bled &s;o abundantly that exce&s;&s;ive weakne&s;s was the con&s;equence, and retarded my departure. Obliged to re|main at Hamburg till I gathered &s;trength, I wrote to my valet de chambre to come to me there. My &s;ickne&s;s was the natural con&s;equence of my feelings, and the fatigues of my journey, and was certainly a fortunate one. It calmed the violence of my tran&s;ports, and obliged me to follow the plan I my&s;elf had laid down, as &s;oon as I knew you to be the hu&s;band of Caroline.</P>
<P>"At pre&s;ent, when I no longer feel this weakne&s;s, I may own that more than twenty times on the road was I tempted to return to Ronebourg, and from your hand de|mand Caroline or death. Had I been obliged to remain at Hamburg without falling ill, perhaps, I &s;hould have been overcome, and for ever have rendered my&s;elf un|worthy your e&s;teem and friend&s;hip. My fever, and its con&s;equent weakne&s;s, &s;hewed me objects under a different

point of view; and, whether the organization of the body influences the mind, whether it was the re&s;ult of reflections ince&s;&s;antly made, or whether friend&s;hip really triumphed over love, certain it is my pa&s;&s;ion, each day, became feebler; or, rather, rea&s;on became &s;tronger. I &s;till adored Caroline, but I adored her as a deity, without daring to &s;uppo&s;e I again might &s;ee her. I &s;huddered even at the idea, and, far from wi&s;hing to return, I wi&s;hed to remove farther off, and therefore waited impatiently for Varner.</P>
<P>"Such was the temper of my mind when the young Baron de Manteul arrived at Hamburg, and came to lodge in the &s;ame hotel: my ho&s;t immediately informed him of my illne&s;s, exaggerated the danger I had been in, the care he had taken of me, the &s;low recovery of my &s;trength and in&s;pired him with a wi&s;h to become acquainted with me. He &s;ent up his compliments, and, as his was a Saxon family well known, I received him with plea&s;ure. His appearance gave me a favourable impre&s;&s;ion, which was confirmed by his conver&s;ation. He was equally plea&s;ed with me, and in a few hours we were old friends. He, likewi&s;e, was going to England, but could not &s;top more than three days at Hamburg: hearing I intended to cro&s;s the &s;ea, he earne&s;tly entreated me to embark on board the &s;ame &s;hip. My health, which daily grew &s;tronger, per|mitted me to depart, and I willingly con&s;ented to a reque&s;t by which I &s;hould gain &s;uch an agreeable companion. I left a letter of in&s;tructions for my valet with the ho&s;t, and in two days we left Hamburg, mutually congratulating each other on this lucky rencounter: we further agreed to live together, at London, and take lodgings in the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"This young gentleman was the more agreeable to me for being almo&s;t as melancholy as my&s;elf, and we often &s;ighed in &s;ympathy: he fir&s;t made the remark. During the voyage we were alone on the deck, each ab&s;orbed in his own ideas, and each pre&s;erving the mo&s;t profound &s;i|lence. Manteul at length &s;poke; "I think," &s;aid he, "I have di&s;covered another conformity between us. Is it not true, dear Lindorf, that your heart is engaged, and that you deeply regret &s;ome per&s;on whom you have left in your own country?" I not choo&s;ing to give a direct an&s;wer, retorted the que&s;tion on him&s;elf, and told him he had made the confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="034126_0278_0FFA9238EDF20A08">"I own it," replied he; "and, did you know the per&s;on I regret, you then would have &s;ome knowledge of what my feelings are. When I quitted Saxony, I ima|gined I fled from the danger of loving the mo&s;t charming woman in the world; but, now I &s;ee her no more, I feel the mi&s;chief is done, and that I fled too late."</P>
<P>"I owned my heart was as much en&s;laved as his, but added nothing farther; I rather endeavoured to turn the conver&s;ation, by making reflections on the pangs and ef|fects of love.</P>
<P>"We had a good voyage, and arrived &s;afe at London. The novelty of this va&s;t city, its riches, the multitude of its inhabitants, and that peculiarity of manners which di&s;tance and a government &s;o different produce, greatly relieved my melancholy; and, as I mo&s;t &s;incerely de&s;ired to be wholly cured of it, I my&s;elf ardently &s;ought amu&s;e|ment. I recovered health and &s;trength apace, and even a part of my natural cheerfulne&s;s, yet did Caroline occu|py my heart and thoughts, and, whenever I was alone, I found they turned wholly on her; but, as I dreaded the dangerous recollection, I took every po&s;&s;ible means to re|move it, and remained alone as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible. Man|teul &s;eldom left me; he found, each day, his attachment increa&s;e, and &s;eemed to fear we &s;hould part too &s;oon.&mdash; He told me he had received letters from Dre&s;den, which had lain at his banker's, waiting his arrival at London, that gave him va&s;t plea&s;ure. "My return," &s;aid he, "may be much &s;ooner than I &s;uppo&s;ed; but the event that will then call me back will be &s;o happy a one I &s;hall only have my friend to regret." I could ea&s;ily perceive he wi&s;hed to open his heart to me, but that would have required a reciprocal confidence, and I was determined never to re|veal my criminal &s;ecret, nor ever once to pronounce the name of Caroline; I, therefore, forbore to a&s;k him who the object of his attachment might be, or to put any one que&s;tion which might lead him to &s;peak.</P>
<P>"We had been pre&s;ented, by our amba&s;&s;ador at Lon|don, to &s;everal Engli&s;h noblemen; and, among others, we one day dined with the Earl of Sali&s;bury. After din|ner the toa&s;t went round, as you know, Wal&s;tein, is the cu&s;tom in England, and the health of the favourite lady given by each gue&s;t. When the toa&s;t came to me, my heart named Caroline, and the word ro&s;e to my lips. I forbore, however, and begged they would excu&s;e my na|ming
<PB N="137" REF="034126_0279_0FFA927D636CE0D0">
the lady who&s;e health I drank. They joked me on my great di&s;cretion, and drank to the health of the fair incognita.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall not be &s;o di&s;creet as Lindorf," &s;aid Manteul, when it came to his turn; "I am proud to drink the health of Matilda, Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein."</P>
<P>"The name &s;truck me &s;o forcibly that I &s;carcely could believe what I heard real; but it was repeated round the table &s;o often that I could no longer doubt it was that &s;ame Matilda by whom I had been &s;o tenderly loved, and whom I had &s;o cruelly offended, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould paint the agitation I was in; though, but a moment be|fore, I &s;hould not have &s;uppo&s;ed any human power could have pronounced a name, except Caroline, that might have made an equal impre&s;&s;ion. Manteul &s;at too far off for me to a&s;k&punc; whether it was Matilda whom he loved; yet, how might I doubt when I beheld his animated countenance, as he repeated, him&s;elf, and heard others repeat her name? I looked and thought him hand&s;omer than u&s;ual; he &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the qualities of a lo|ver, and, certainly, &s;aid I, he is beloved. The letters which gave him &s;uch plea&s;ure are, certainly, from Matil|da, and his quick return to Dre&s;den, which is to render him &s;o happy, is al&s;o, as certainly the con&s;equence of her command; he is then to receive her hand who&s;e heart he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es!</P>
<P>"The&s;e ideas ran in my mind all the afternoon, and accompanied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> play, whither I was dragged in &s;pite of my&s;elf. I wi&s;hed immediately to have conver&s;ed with Mante<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to have learned his &s;ecret; reproached my&s;elf for having mi&s;&s;ed the opportunity, and feared left it might not return; at la&s;t, finding my&s;elf unea&s;y in the play-hou&s;e, where I neither heard nor &s;aw, I determined to quit it and come home. I there waited the arrival of Manteul with an impatience wholly unaccountable to my|&s;elf. It was not long before he came; my going had alarmed him, and &s;carcely did I give him time to tell me &s;o, before I a&s;ked if the lady who&s;e health he had drank were the lady he loved, and if &s;he were &s;i&s;ter to the Count of Wal&s;tein, Amba&s;&s;ador in Ru&s;&s;ia."</P>
<P>"Ay, certainly," replied he, with tran&s;port; "&s;he, &s;he her&s;elf, your charming countrywoman! Are you acquaint|ed with her? It is &s;ome time &s;ince &s;he left Berlin."</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="034126_0280_0FFA923A965890D8">"I know her brother," replied I, eluding his que&s;tion. "The Count of Wal&s;tein has been to me more than a friend; a father, a &s;aviour, the man in the world mo&s;t dear to my heart."</P>
<P>"Ah! dear Lindorf," &s;aid Manteul, embracing me with rapture, "if you are upon the&s;e terms with the Count of Wal&s;tein, I may owe all my future bli&s;s to your friend&s;hip. She has often prote&s;ted that her brother, alone, had a right to di&s;po&s;e of her hand; and to him you may &s;peak for me; you may engage him to favour my pa&s;|&s;ion.&mdash;Say, will you, Lindorf, will you?"</P>
<P>"Doubt it not, my friend. Should Matilda, al&s;o, find this union that which her heart de&s;ires, I then will u&s;e all the power of my friend&s;hip with the Count to en|gage him in your intere&s;t. But I thought Matilda, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, contracted to the Baron de Za&s;trow."</P>
<P>"Alas! it was that projected marriage which alone de|termined me to leave Dre&s;den. I was the friend of de Za&s;trow, and would not become his rival. I then was ignorant how much Matilda di&s;liked him; but the letter from my &s;i&s;ter, which I found waiting my arrival here, informed me of it, and has given me the mo&s;t flattering hopes."</P>
<P>"And had you none before you received that letter?"</P>
<P>"None, none, Matilda never te&s;tified any thing more than e&s;teem for me, and that friend&s;hip which I thought the con&s;equence of her intimacy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;i&s;ter; &s;he did not &s;eem even to perceive how m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erred her to every other woman.

<P>"I mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hed to get a &s;ight of this letter he mentioned, and my wi&s;h was gratified; he gave it me to read.&mdash;"Here, take it, my friend," &s;aid he, "and &s;ee if I have not &s;ome rea&s;on to flatter my&s;elf I am beloved." &mdash;I accordingly took it, and, with great emotion, began to read.</P>
<P>"Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul blamed her brother for departing, not following her advice, and openly paying his addre&s;&s;es to the young Counte&s;s. The Baron de Za&s;|trow had no right to be affronted; he was hated, and the marriage would never take place. Every thing, on the contrary&punc; proved to her that her brother was beloved;

&s;he had remarked it before he left Dre&s;den, and &s;he now had not any doubt. Matilda was very &s;orry when &s;he heard he was gone, &s;he had even &s;hed tears; her former cheerfulne&s;s had for&s;aken her, and what convinces me, &s;aid &s;he, your ab&s;ence cau&s;es her melancholy, is, that it redoubles whenever England is mentioned. She ye&s;ter|day &s;aid, in a pet which made her look more lovely, 'I wonder why the men are all &s;o eager to run to that good for nothing England!'

I hope &s;oon to give you more certain information which &s;hall ha&s;ten your return."</P>
<P>"This letter &s;eemed to me a clear proof that Matilda loved young Manteul, and I felt a painful &s;en&s;ation, a &s;pa&s;m of the heart, which I could not account for, and which I endeavoured to conceal. I returned the letter, and confirmed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.&mdash;"I have written to my &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid he, exactly as &s;he pre&s;cribed, and I impatiently wait her an&s;wer: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as &s;he thinks, it &s;hould be favourable, and if Matilda will permit me to a&s;pire to the honour and happine&s;s of making her mine, you, dear Lindorf, may be &s;erviceable to my intere&s;ts with the Count, her brother. I may owe my felicity to you, and my friend&s;hip for you will thus be increa&s;ed."</P>
<P>"This I &s;olemnly promi&s;ed, but not without a &s;en&s;a|tion that &s;eemed very like jealou&s;y, which the de&s;cription he gave of the lovely Matilda augmented. I could not deny I had often &s;een her before &s;he left Berlin, and he added, "You would not know her Lindorf; no, you would not know her. You cannot imagine how much &s;he is altered, how much improved. I know not whe|ther it be po&s;&s;ible to find a more beautiful woman; but a more graceful, a more charming one the world does not

contain: &s;he has every thing that can &s;educe and awe the heart. Her features have not a tame regularity; no, each has an expre&s;&s;ion peculiar to it&s;elf; her countenance is continually varying, and is the mirror of a mo&s;t excellent heart, and a mo&s;t amiable mind. Never long the &s;ame, &s;he is playful, &s;portive, forward, cheerful, pretending to take pet, and laughing at the deception &s;he has occa&s;ioned. She in&s;pires joy and plea&s;ure in all around her. At other times, mild, fond, and full of &s;en&s;ibility, &s;he would melt the colde&s;t or the harde&s;t heart. Such I beheld her every day; and how might I re&s;i&s;t &s;o many allurements; or what &s;hall be my happine&s;s &s;hould &s;he become mine?"</P>
<P>"My &s;ecret regret for having wilfully ca&s;t this happi|ne&s;s from me was the an&s;wer my heart returned to Man|teul. And had I!&mdash;had I been beloved by this charm|ing lady! And did it once depend only on me to have made her for ever mine! Oh! how little had I merited a gift the value of which too late I knew! What! had &s;he not a right to forget the man who repaid her affect on with the blacke&s;t ingratitude; neglected, abandoned her, and, on the very fir&s;t occa&s;ion, yielding wholly to the love of another, repelled the heart which fondly had be|&s;towed it&s;elf on him, and obliged it to &s;eek a mate more worthy?&mdash;The&s;e ideas rapidly &s;ucceeded each other in my mind, and gave me an ab&s;ent and gloomy air, at which Manteul might well have been &s;urpri&s;ed; but he was too much intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject of the conver&s;ation to per|ceive it; was too de&s;irous of continu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;peak of his dear Matilda, and his future hopes. It was not po&s;&s;ible, however, for me to hear him unmoved&punc; I, therefore, pretended I was not very well, and withdrew.</P>
<P>"No &s;ooner was I alone than I began to inquire what my &s;en&s;ations were, and how I might feel this &s;trange emotion concerning an event which I ought to have fore|&s;een. Since I had not loved Matilda, &s;ince I had re|nounced her heart and hand, what were my rights?&mdash; Ought I not to be happy that another had been more ju&s;t, and made reparation for my wrongs? Alas! &s;o far, was I from being happy, from thinking thus, that it &s;eemed as if Manteul bore away a trea&s;ure which appertained to me alone; nay I was incon&s;i&s;tant, unju&s;t, enough to accu&s;e Matilda of want of con&s;tancy, guilty as I my&s;elf had been! I recollected every circum&s;tance of our acquain|tance, tho&s;e tender promi&s;es, &s;o ingenuous, &s;o often re|peated
<PB N="141" REF="034126_0283_0FFA60A60FD567E0">
in her letters, to love me, and me only, and ex|claimed, All women are incon&s;tant; as if I my&s;elf had not been an example that men have, at lea&s;t that I had, very little rea&s;on for the&s;e reproaches!</P>
<P>"I next reflected on the &s;ituation in which I &s;tood with Manteul, and that folly which, a &s;econd time, had made me the rival of a friend. Yet dur&s;t I not allow my&s;elf to &s;ay I was his rival, but promi&s;ed, if he were beloved, as every thing gave me rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, I would &s;erve him with all the ardor of friend&s;hip: this I pre&s;ently a&s;&s;ured him of, and we waited, with equal im|patience, the an&s;wer of his &s;i&s;ter, which was to contain his &s;entence."</P>
<P>"Well, but Caroline? Is &s;he wholly forgotten; al|ready effaced from that heart where &s;he had reigned with &s;uch unbounded &s;way?"</P>
<P>"From my own experience, Wal&s;tein, I am convinced the heart, when it ab&s;olutely lo&s;es hope, lo&s;es, in part, its pain; not, perhaps, in every in&s;tance, but in mo&s;t; and, where love is the pa&s;&s;ion, whenever a new object is found, that, by any concurrence of circum&s;tances, be|comes intere&s;ting, the former is pre&s;ently forgotten; at lea&s;t, &s;o far forgotten as not to be remembered with the &s;ame re&s;tle&s;s and tormenting &s;en&s;ations. I thought of Caroline, Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein, but not of Caroline of Lichtfield, and was mo&s;t happy to encourage the mutabi|lity; my imagination no longer wandered in the gardens of Rindaw, or dwelt in the pavilion, but &s;aw Caroline at Berlin, there in company with the be&s;t of hu&s;bands, and enjoying her felicity. Happy was I when thus I might remember her without remor&s;e, and, whenever her name ro&s;e to memory, the name of my friend was, al&s;o, pre&s;ent; while that of Matilda, which Manteul was ince&s;&s;antly repeating, gave me an emotion, the origin of which I, who had had &s;o much experience, could not mi&s;take.&mdash; Thus, my friend, you &s;ee my cure is far advanced; and you &s;oon will learn in what manner I was perfectly re|&s;tored.</P>
<P>"On our fir&s;t arrival in England, we de&s;igned to have travelled through the different counties; but, &s;uppo&s;ing we &s;hould remain there all winter, intended to have de|ferred our journey till the &s;pring. Manteul, determined to depart immediately, &s;hould his &s;i&s;ter's letter recall him to Dre&s;den, entreated me now to go with him and, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

lea&s;t, vi&s;it the mo&s;t famous places. Since I had learned his &s;ecret I was ill at ea&s;e, and little inclined to re&s;t long in one place. A journey, I imagined, would be &s;ome relief, and I willingly con&s;ented. We &s;et off, therefore, pa&s;&s;ed through various counties, and a part of Wales, &s;topping to examine what was held mo&s;t curious and in|tere&s;ting. This, dear Count, is not the moment to give you a de&s;cription of a country, where peace and liberty produce abundance, where the productive fields, culti|vated by wealthy farmers, are not, like ours, the &s;cenes of bloody battles, and all their direful attendants. Cer|tain of finding them nouri&s;hment, the inhabitants fear not to marry and beget children. The towns, villages, and cities are extremely populous, and every per&s;on &s;eems happy; and, as the Engli&s;h nobility pa&s;s one part of the year at their country &s;eats, where they contribute to the pro&s;perity of their tenants, tho&s;e beautiful country &s;eats are built with an elegance, and pre&s;erved in a &s;tyle of grandeur and ta&s;te, very different from the gloomy mag|nificence of our antique chateaus. If we wi&s;h to form an idea of the beauties of nature, and the inexpre&s;&s;ible charms of a country life, we mu&s;t go to England."</P>
<P>"You augment the wi&s;h I have to &s;ee that country," &s;aid the Count; "I intend to take my dear Caroline thi|ther; but till that happens, &s;hall be glad of farther infor|mation."</P>
<P>"I know not whether I am capable of affording you any," replied Lindorf, "for we travelled with too much rapidity, and our hearts and minds were too much pre|occupied, to remark the numerous things de&s;erving no|tice. I have only ju&s;t mentioned what mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;trike every foreigner who beholds England for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>"Impatience to receive news from Dre&s;den made us &s;oon turn our faces towards London: I certainly was more unea&s;y than Manteul. The hope he had conceived contributed much to his happine&s;s, which I rather envied than participated; and the more cheerful and animated I &s;aw him, the more did my &s;ecret chagrin and gloom in|crea&s;e. I &s;poke to him, however, continually, concern|ing Matilda, led him to repeat the mo&s;t minute circum|&s;tances, and was as inexhau&s;tible in my que&s;tions as Man|teul was in replies. This was our chief &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation, and, every moment, grief, regret, jealou&s;y, and
<PB N="143" REF="034126_0285_0FFA9285B31DF7D0">
I may add love, acquired new force. Manteul found no letters when we came to London; but, two days after our arrival, as I was ri&s;ing, intending to breakfa&s;t with him, his &s;ervant brought me a letter, with my addre&s;s. Surpri&s;ed at this, I immediately was going to him, but was informed he was gone out, and would not be at home before dinner. My a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;ed, and I open|ed the letter, not without emotion, which &s;till became more forcible when I &s;aw the cover inclo&s;ed a letter that had been opened, addre&s;&s;ed to Manteul, with the po&s;t|mark of Dre&s;den, which, by its &s;ize, &s;eemed &s;till to con|tain another. This I &s;uppo&s;ed to be the an&s;wer of his &s;i&s;ter, and a letter inclo&s;ed from Matilda. But wherefore not bring them him&s;elf? In &s;pite of my impatience to &s;ee it, I began by reading the few lines Manteul had written in the cover. "Here it is," &s;aid Lindorf, taking it from his pocket-book, "and imagine what was my &s;urpri&s;e:"

I could not endure the thought. You, dear Count, are capable of imagining what my feelings were, and the increa&s;e they &s;uffered by recollection. This was the &s;econd time love had a&s;&s;aulted friend&s;hip, and a &s;econd time was I de&s;irous friend&s;hip &s;hould be victori|ous. I would not read the letters till I fir&s;t had ju&s;tified my&s;elf to Manteul, and till I had his free con&s;ent to read them: I locked them up, and in&s;tantly went in &s;earch of him to the coffee hou&s;e, where he had not yet been, and where the mo&s;t probable way of meeting him would have been to wait: but waiting at this moment was impo&s;&s;ible. I ran to &s;eek him el&s;ewhere. I rather cho&s;e &s;peaking to him than writing a letter long enough to have explained all the rea&s;ons of my conduct, which little &s;uited my im|patience; but as we might mi&s;s each other in the &s;earch, I left a line at the coffee hou&s;e, &s;aying "he did me ju&s;|tice in believing me incapable of perfidy; that, certainly, I had many things to reproach my&s;elf with, but not that of treachery towards him. Matilda only had a right to complain. I begged him to wait at the coffee-hou&s;e, and pledged my&s;elf to give him every explanation he could require, a&s;&s;uring him I &s;hould not take a moment's re&s;t till he had heard me&punc; I had not read, nor would not read, a line in the letters he had &s;ent me, and hoped to prove how highly I valued his e&s;teem and friend&s;hip!"</P>
<P>"After giving this note to the waiter I continued my &s;earch, went to the Pru&s;&s;ian Amba&s;&s;ador's, into the Park, to all our acquaintances, but mi&s;&s;ed him every where; and returning to the coffee-hou&s;e, found to my great vex|ation, he had been there and was gone, but that he had left a note for me, which was this.

<P>"Scarcely had I fini&s;hed before I flew to the hou&s;e of Lord Cavendi&s;h, hoping &s;till to find him; but they were gone po&s;t, and I he&s;itated for a moment whether I &s;hould or &s;hould not follow; but motives &s;o &s;trong, and a de&s;ire &s;o ardent drew me el&s;ewhere that I could not long re&s;i&s;t. I once more read the note of Manteul, and finding he a|voided me, 'Why,' &s;aid I, '&s;hould I force the &s;ight of a happy rival on him in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m of grief?' Was I in reality beloved by the generous Matilda? Manteul, only, yet, had told me &s;o, and I longed to &s;ee the confirm|ation. I, therefore, returned home, and read the two letters I am going to &s;hew you. You will begin by read|ing that of Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, as I did, tho' mo&s;t impatient to &s;ee the other, which, addre&s;&s;ed to me, made my heart palpitate. I trembled to open a paper where each word, traced by the hand of Matilda, mu&s;t be a re|proach to this incon&s;tant heart. She, perhaps, knew not my infidelity; but was I, therefore, le&s;s culpable?&mdash;Ah! when I did read, how did her ingenuous and affectionate &s;oul, which infu&s;ed it&s;elf into the paper, augment my wrongs, and make me more &s;elf-odious! "I began with this," &s;aid Lindorf, giving it to the Count.</P>
<P>"Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul fir&s;t a&s;ked a thou&s;and par|dons of her brother for having given him fal&s;e hopes. De|ceived her&s;elf, &s;he had believed the thing &s;he wi&s;hed to be was true, and that he had been the &s;ecret object of Ma|tilda's love. It was your letter," added &s;he, "that very letter I reque&s;ted you to write, and from which I expect|ed
<PB N="146" REF="034126_0288_0FFA9246E684EA88">
effects &s;o very different, that de&s;troyed all my hopes. No, brother, you are not the beloved man. Matilda has long &s;ince yielded her heart. She refu&s;es the homage of de Za&s;trow, of you, and of the whole world, for the &s;ake of your new friend, that very Baron of Lindorf of whom you &s;peak. She &s;aw but his name in your letter, and in|&s;tantly her &s;ecret was betrayed: yet it can now be no &s;e|cret to you, for, being thus intimate with that gentleman, he, by this, has certainly made you his confidant; cer|tainly, his told you he has long &s;ince been contracted to the young Counte&s;s of Wal&s;tein. Her brother, the mo&s;t intimate friend of Lindorf, promoted this union, and their hearts were accordant to his wi&s;hes. Matilda declares no|thing can break this tie but death; for, though Lindorf &s;hall prove incon&s;tant, &s;he never will. Your pa&s;&s;ion, therefore, dear brother, for your own &s;ake, you will van|qui&s;h, and I think I know you &s;ufficiently rea&s;onable and generous to re&s;t a&s;&s;ured it will change to friend&s;hip, and that you will take a plea&s;ure at once to &s;erve Matilda and her lover. This you may do by giving him the inclo&s;ed letter, which the poor young lady had no means of &s;end|ing. It is not &s;he that reque&s;ts this, but I; thinking it the be&s;t means of effecting your cure. Tell this Lindorf that his mi&s;tre&s;s is per&s;ecuted by her aunt, who will o|blige her to wed de Za&s;trow, whom &s;he hates; that this will certainly occa&s;ion her death: prevail on him to depart in&s;tantly, that he may con&s;ole, deliver, and carry her off, if nece&s;&s;ary; and, indeed, I &s;ee no other means. What can he have to fear, &s;ince he is authorized by her brother? You well may &s;uppo&s;e, Charles, I &s;hould have been hap|py had you been the man; but her heart was be&s;towed be|fore &s;he came to Dre&s;den. Endeavour, therefore, only to contribute to her happine&s;s; and, perhaps, to your &s;i&s;ter's likewi&s;e."</P>
<P>This latter phra&s;e, which had e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of Lindorf, made the Count &s;mile, and confirmed him in his former opinion of Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul. He re|turned the letter to Lindorf, who then gave him that from Matilda&mdash;"Read," &s;aid he, "and think what mu&s;t be the impre&s;&s;ion it made on me!"</P>

<P>The Count was affected at reading this letter, and &s;e|verely reprehended him&s;elf for having &s;uffered his pa&s;&s;ion for Caroline to make him &s;o far neglect his &s;i&s;ter. He ought not to have been &s;atisfied with writing a letter; he &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed it might be intercepted, and have gone him&s;elf.

<P>"I did not he&s;itate a moment, after I had read it," con|tinued he, "concerning how I mu&s;t act. To fly to her, to con&s;ole her, to entreat her to forgive the injuries I had done her, to tear her from the arms of tyranny, and to de|dicate my life to her happine&s;s, was the fir&s;t wi&s;h, the vow of my heart.

doubt re&s;pecting my own conduct, and the my&s;tery I had made of my engagements with Matilda. I, therefore, &s;at down and wrote a circum&s;tantial account of what my mo|tives and intentions were, in which I concealed nothing but the name of Caroline, and owned that what he had &s;aid of Matilda had more than revived my former inclina|tion for her; but that, feeling &s;he had every right to for|get me, I was re&s;olved to make her every reparation I might, by aiding her in this her &s;uppo&s;ed new pa&s;&s;ion. My letter was long, and I was &s;till writing when the &s;er|vant, whom Manteul had taken with him, returned. He, on recollection, had &s;ent him back with another note, which was but a &s;ort of repetition of the preceding one, fearing le&s;t it had not come to hand, and that my depart|ure was thereby deferred. He added new and &s;tronger motives to ha&s;ten me, and, that I might not have the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s on his account, a&s;&s;ured me, "he looked on it as a lucky event; too young, at pre&s;ent, to marry, (he is not twenty) no woman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut Matilda <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould have excu&s;ed his entering into the marriage &s;tate.

By the&s;e he would profit, would &s;tudy, and travel for &s;ome years, and hoped, when we met again, to find me the hap|py hu&s;band of the mo&s;t lovely of women. Whatever my motives might have been for for&s;aking her, he was certain I no longer &s;hould be incon&s;tant the moment I &s;aw her. He knew me too well to believe I &s;hould not immediate|ly fly to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, though it were but from motives of friend&s;hip, and if I even was incapable of love. He concluded by telling me his &s;ervant had orders to return to him as &s;oon as he had &s;een me get into the po&s;t-chai&s;e."</P>
<P>"I &s;ent back the voluminous letter I had written, and his &s;ervant departed for Newmarket, at the &s;ame time that I left London. The wind was favourable, and we had a quick pa&s;&s;age.

Nay, I even interpreted your two pre&s;&s;ing let|ters into po&s;itive orders that related &s;olely to Matilda, and concluded I be&s;t was an&s;wering your intentions by flying to her aid before I &s;aw you.

The re&s;t you know; my rencounter with de Za&s;trow, and my &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing Matilda leap out of the po&s;t-chai&s;e: though I have not yet ventured to tell you, before her, how much the alteration in her per&s;on affected, a&s;toni&s;hed, and enchanted me; how &s;uperior &s;he was to the Matilda I had formerly known, to her Manteul had de&s;cribed, or even to what my imagination had &s;uppo&s;ed. Oh! Wal|&s;tein, how beauteous! how angelic did &s;he &s;eem, embel|li&s;hed as her countenance was by the emotions of her heart! The fir&s;t words &s;he uttered had &s;omething of tenderne&s;s, of feeling, of &s;oul, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to convey. I &s;ee her now fly from the carriage, run wi&s;h open arms, and hear her utter, Lindorf, dear Lindorf, they want to &s;teal your Matilda from you, who is, and only will be yours!</P>
<P>"Her native innocence is above all &s;u&s;picion; &s;he loves, her&s;elf, and thinks it mo&s;t certain &s;he is, her&s;elf, beloved. Not a year's &s;ilence, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll that others have &s;aid, nor all that I have done, could &s;hake her con&s;tancy. The mo|ment &s;he &s;ees me they are all forgotten, and not a &s;hadow of doubt remains. Ah! when fainting and feeble &s;he &s;unk into my arms, pale, inanimate, and with half clo&s;ed eyes, how intere&s;ting was it to my &s;oul! With what ardor did I &s;wear to live with her, and her alone! On her lips, as I bore her into the hou&s;e, I pronounced the vow which I never can forget, no more than I can the rapturous &s;en|&s;ations I tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> moment experienced.</P>
<P>"My affair with de Za&s;trow, my wound, the tender care &s;he has taken of me, her under&s;tanding, her grace, her ingenuous mind, all have augmented my pa&s;&s;ion. Yet will I own I felt &s;ome emotion at the &s;ight of Caroline; but it was of a very different kind from what I had for|merly known. I &s;aw with plea&s;ure, yes, Wal&s;tein, with
<PB N="151" REF="034126_0293_0FFA9291621B1828">
infinite plea&s;ure, you were beloved, and Caroline was to me as a &s;i&s;ter, the wife of my friend and brother. And now, dear Count, you know my inmo&s;t heart, and I hope will not delay to be&s;tow that happine&s;s I &s;o ardently de|&s;ire, which pre&s;ent conviction tells me I de&s;erve, and which will make felicity perfect."</P>
<P>"My felicity," replied the Count, tenderly embracing him, "will not be perfect till I behold Matilda and Lin|dorf as happy as I my&s;elf am; nor &s;hall it be long before the&s;e new bonds of affinity and friend&s;hip &s;hall be formed, which will leave me nothing farther to wi&s;h."</P>
<P>Wal&s;tein then related all his pa&s;t &s;cenes with Caroline. Lindorf &s;huddered at the idea of the divorce. "Good God!" &s;aid he, "could you &s;uppo&s;e I would be acce&s;&s;ary, to &s;uch a &s;acrifice! That I would &s;ee happy at the ex|pence of Wal&s;tein!"</P>
<P>"It was the happine&s;s of Caroline that was in conte&s;t, and neither you nor I, Lindorf, ought then to recede. The letters I wrote, and which thou woulde&s;t have found on thy arrival, would have removed every &s;cruple: friend&s;hip and delicacy mu&s;t have yielded to motives more deci&s;ive. My rea&s;ons were good, and my mea&s;ures well taken, and thou coulde&s;t not but have acted accord|ingly."</P>
<P>"A&s;k me not how I &s;hould have acted," replied Lin|dorf; "I, fortunately, have not been put to the proof. I am proud of being your brother. You only could de|&s;erve Caroline, and &s;he alone could equal your virtues. Matilda, perhaps, is, by temper and nature, better &s;uited to your friend Lindorf."</P>
<P>"She does not know," &s;aid the Count, "that Caro|line has been her rival?"&mdash;She knows every thing," replied Lindorf, with vivacity. "She has a right to know every thing. My heart were unworthy of her had I any &s;ecrets. In ju&s;tice, I was obliged to account for my coolne&s;s, my &s;ilence, my voyage to England. Might I deceive her? No, impo&s;&s;ible; and had I even &s;o in|tended, no &s;uch intention could have been kept. Her noble frankne&s;s, her open candour, would irre&s;i&s;tibly have en&s;ured like confidence and like &s;incerity. No &s;ooner were we alone in the po&s;t-chai&s;e than &s;he &s;poke of you and your marriage; and a&s;ked if I knew her &s;i&s;ter. A full confe&s;&s;ion of all that had pa&s;&s;ed was my an&s;wer; and, far from feeling jealou&s;y or vexation, I found, as I
<PB N="152" REF="034126_0294_0FFA924F08773C80">
&s;poke, &s;he became attached to Caroline, was de&s;irous of her friend&s;hip, and determined to imitate her be&s;t quali|ties and virtues.&mdash;Oh! how dearly," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;hall I love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is charming Caroline! How happy will &s;he make my brother! And how gladly &s;hall I learn, from her, to reclaim and fix my rover, my Lindorf!"&mdash;Since Matilda has &s;een her, &s;he has told me, with a tone of &s;incerity that leaves no doubt on the mind, "Ah! Lindorf, how perfectly are you ju&s;tified in your pa&s;&s;ion! I never could have pardoned you had you &s;een Caroline with indiffer|ence!" Such, dear Count, is your &s;i&s;ter; and judge whether I ought not to adore her."</P>
<P>Arrived at Berlin, the fir&s;t care of the Count was to pre&s;ent his friend and &s;i&s;ter to the King, and reque&s;t his approbation of their marriage; which obtained, the hap|py family went to the Wal&s;tein e&s;tate, where Caroline had fled <HI>from</HI> her hu&s;band, on the bridal day, and <HI>to</HI> him on the morning of the projected divorce, and of which Ju&s;tin was &s;teward. There, in the Count's chapel, was the marriage celebrated, without other witne&s;&s;es than Wal&s;tein, Caroline, the tenants of the Chateau, and &s;ome of the villagers. As they left the church, Loui&s;a came to pay her re&s;pects to Lindorf, to whom &s;he was pre&s;ent|ed by Caroline. He beheld both tho&s;e lovely women, who formerly had rai&s;ed &s;uch commotions in his brea&s;t, with perfect tranquillity; and, pre&s;&s;ing the hand of the Count, who &s;tood next him, "I feel at this moment," &s;aid he, "I am worthy to be the brother of Wal&s;tein. I was di&s;tracted for Loui&s;a, Caroline I adored, but Ma|tilda I love, and &s;hall for ever love!"</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>TO tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be informed of every thing that pa&s;&s;es we &s;hall further &s;ay, that Lindorf continued thus to think; that he made his lovely lady happy, attained to the highe&s;t rank in the army, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on &s;everal occa&s;ions. That Edmund, Count of Wal&s;tein, was a pillar to the throne, a friend of the King, a pro|tector of the people, a &s;upporter of the wretched, and that he found, in the con&s;tant affection of his dear Caroline, and the good conduct of his children, the full recompen&s;e of his virtues; while Caroline, the adored, the beloved
<PB N="153" REF="034126_0295_0FFA929413296158">
Caroline, meeting the admiration &s;he merited, was the happie&s;t as &s;he was the mo&s;t angelic of women.</P>
<P>We &s;hall likewi&s;e add that the young Baron de Za|&s;trow, admiring his Pari&s;ian graces, engrafted on a German trunk, finding he plea&s;ed only Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul, who plea&s;ed not him, returned to Paris and his gaming friends, pur&s;ued his theatrical conque&s;ts, and made &s;uch good u&s;e of his time, money, and con&s;titution that, in le&s;s than a year, he was ruined, di&s;ea&s;ed and dead. His aunt, perceiving Matilda had had good rea&s;on for her refu&s;al, pardoned, and left her all her wealth.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle de Manteul retired, at fir&s;t, into a con|vent; after which &s;he obtained the place of a lady of honor, at court; where, exerci&s;ing that &s;pirit of intrigue with which &s;he was &s;o liberally endowed, &s;he became perfectly competent to her po&s;t.</P>
<P>Her young brother, the well di&s;po&s;ed and amiable Manteul, for whom we have been intere&s;ted, and whom we &s;aw &s;et off to Newmarket, met with Lady Sophia Seymour, who was cou&s;in german to the Count and Ma|tilda, and who greatly re&s;embled the latter. Manteul now found he was far from having &s;uffered a lo&s;s, ina&s;|much as Lady Sophia, no wi&s;e inferior to her lovely cou&s;in, loved him with all the ardour with which Ma|tilda loved Lindorf. The Count, in a voyage he made to London, in company with Caroline, had the plea&s;ure of forming this union, and making two more lovers happy.</P>
