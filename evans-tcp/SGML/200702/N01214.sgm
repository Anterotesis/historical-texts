<P>The Honourable Judges of Her Maje&s;ties Superiour Court of Judi|cature, have &s;een cau&s;e to direct me to Preach again&s;t the Sin of Drun|kenne&s;s on this Occa&s;ion; becau&s;e both the Murderers, and the Per&s;ons by them Murdered, were overtaken with Drink, when the acts of Mur|der were perpetrated.

<P>That it is no new thing for the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s to be followed with Murder; or at lea&s;t with the Ruin and De&s;truction of the Drun|kards them&s;elves, and of others al&s;o by their means, may be plainly in|ferred from the Text we have read unto you: Wherein we have an oc|coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by way of Prediction and De|nunciation, of the Ruin of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> (the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes) procured by the Abounding of this Sin of Drunkenne&s;s among them.
