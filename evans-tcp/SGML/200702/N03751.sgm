<HEAD>TO THE Chri&s;tian Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Women, that were lately exe|cuted at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> were condemn'd by a Law, which I think proper to recite, omitting the Preamble, that it may be better known in all Families that &s;hall have the following Sermon.</P>

<HEAD>An Act to prevent the de&s;troying and mur|dering of Ba&s;tard Children.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Be it enacted by the Governour, Council and Re|pre&s;entatives conven'd in General A&s;&s;embly, and by the Authority of the &s;ame,</HI> That if any Woman be deliver'd of any I&s;&s;ue of her Body, Male or Female, which if it were born alive, &s;hould by Law be a Ba&s;tard, and that &s;he endeavour pri|vately, either by drowning or &s;ecret burying thereof, or any other Way, either by her&s;elf, or by the procuring of others &s;o to conceal the Death thereof, that it may not come to Light, whether it were born alive or not, but be con|ceal'd; in every &s;uch Ca&s;e the Mother &s;o of|fending &s;hall &s;uffer Death, as in Ca&s;e of Mur|der; except &s;uch Mother can make Proof, by one Witne&s;s at the lea&s;t, the Child, who&s;e Death was by her &s;o intended to be conceal'd, was born Dead.</P>

<P>The Execution of the &s;aid Women drew toge|ther a va&s;t Concour&s;e of People, and probably the greater, becau&s;e the&s;e were the fir&s;t Executi|ons that ever were &s;een in this Province: For,
<PB N="ii" REF="004599_0004_100DA9EC16A9C200">
altho' this Province, in &s;ome Part of it, has been inhabited as long as any of the neighbouring Provinces yet never any Per&s;on, before the&s;e unhappy women, was legally convicted of any capital Crime among us.</P>
<P>Now, tho' <HI>Curio&s;ity</HI> might move many Per&s;ons to come to behold tho&s;e &s;ad Objects, I would charitably hope that many came from a <HI>better Principle</HI>; with Minds di&s;pos'd to reflect on the <HI>Vilene&s;s and Corruption of their own Nature,</HI> which would have betrayed them into the wor&s;t of Crimes, had it not been for the <HI>re&s;training Grace</HI> of God, to who&s;e Name alone belongs the Prai&s;e, that any of us have been with-held from the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t horrid Acts of Wickedne&s;s&punc; And, while they ador'd the <HI>Ju&s;tice of God</HI> in leav|ing tho&s;e Criminals to die before their Time, I hope they were <HI>di&s;pos'd to take Warning</HI> by them, agreeable to the Advice of the wi&s;e Man, <HI>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou fooli&s;h; for why &s;hould&s;t thou die before thy Time</HI>? And, as the Pun|i&s;hment of Crimes committed, is de&s;ign'd <HI>in Ter|rorem,</HI> for the Prevention of the like; 'tis to be hoped, that all others, who <HI>hear</HI> of it, will <HI>fear and do no more any &s;uch Wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And, whereas <HI>Secrecy</HI> is a &s;trong Temptation to many Sins, the &s;trange <HI>Di&s;covery of the &s;ecret Crimes of the&s;e poor Women</HI> may well abate the Force of that Temptation. All <HI>our Iniquities are before God, and our &s;ecret Sins in the Light of his Countenance,</HI> who can when he plea&s;es <HI>bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkne&s;s</HI>; as is remarkably evident in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; for an Infant, that was found in a Well at the Entrance into the Town&punc; occa|&s;ioned a <HI>Search</HI> for the Mother of it; whereby it was found that the &s;aid Women had lately been deliver'd of Children: Now each of them deny'd, that the Child in the Well was theirs; and <HI>one</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="004599_0005_100DA9EE2533D978">
of them declar'd, where &s;he had bury'd her Child, which was accordingly found; but the <HI>other</HI> af|firm'd, that &s;he ca&s;t her Child into the River; which has never been found: And &s;he &s;tedfa&s;tly affirm'd to the la&s;t, that &s;he knew nothing of the Child in the Well: So that it looks very proba|ble, that a Woman equally (and perhaps more heinou&s;ly) guilty than either of the&s;e, was the Mother of it&punc; and has yet e&s;cap'd Di&s;covery: But, if &s;he will not <HI>take Warning and give Glory to GOD</HI> by timely Repentance, &s;he will &s;ooner or later find her&s;elf in a doleful Ca&s;e; and her Con|dition may be wor&s;e than if &s;he had been detected with the other Women: For the&s;e were <HI>awaken'd to con&s;ider their Ways</HI>; and, as they <HI>had a Space of Repentance</HI> allow'd them, they <HI>&s;hew'd a Concern to make a due Improvement thereof</HI>; gratefully <HI>accept|ing the good Advice</HI> that was given them from Time to Time, and &s;eriou&s;ly <HI>joining in the Prayers</HI> that were put up for them in Pri&s;on, and <HI>devoutly at|tending on the publick Wor&s;hip:</HI> And they &s;o behav'd both in Pri&s;on and on the Day of their Executi|on, that 'tis charitably hop'd they had <HI>made their Peace with</HI> GOD. <HI>One</HI> of them had been brought up in <HI>gro&s;s Ignorance</HI>; but &s;he &s;eem'd <HI>willing to be in&s;tructed</HI> in the E&s;&s;entials of Chri&s;tianity: <HI>Both</HI> of them greatly <HI>lamented their pa&s;t Life,</HI> and <HI>ac|knowledged the Ju&s;tice of</HI> GOD in leaving them to be brought to &s;uch an untimely End, becau&s;e they had been <HI>great Sinners:</HI> Tho' they <HI>deny'd that they laid violent Hands on their Children; one</HI> affirming that her Child was <HI>dead born;</HI> and the <HI>other,</HI> that hers dy'd <HI>&s;oon after it was born</HI>: But both &s;eem'd &s;en&s;ible of their <HI>Neglect of taking due Care</HI> to pre&s;erve the Life of their Children: So that they tho't them&s;elves guilty of the <HI>Breach of the &s;ixth Commandment by Omi&s;&s;ion,</HI> if not by Com|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB REF="004599_0006_100DA9F05CBC75E8">The numerous <HI>Spectators</HI> &s;eem'd earne&s;tly con|cern'd for them, that they might be <HI>true Penitents&punc;</HI> and O! that <HI>they may all be duly concern'd for them|&s;elves, that they do not live and die without &s;incere Repentance!</HI></P>
<P>And O! that <HI>the &s;ad End of the&s;e Women may be a Warning to all others, to take Heed of the Sin of Uncleanne&s;s,</HI> which is a Sin peculiarly oppo&s;ite to God's un&s;potted Purity, and &s;hall not e&s;cape his righteous Judgment: <HI>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge:</HI> And this Sin has doubtle&s;s often betray'd Per&s;ons into the <HI>crim&s;on Sin of Murder, for the Concealment</HI> thereof; as the <HI>Monk's Fi&s;h-ponds</HI> &s;adly te&s;tify'd in the Beginning of the Reforma|tion; and there have been many &s;ad In&s;tances thereof be&s;ides in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P><HI>Happy is the Man that feareth always; but he that hardeneth his Heart, falleth into Mi&s;chief.</HI> We have all need to beg of God, that he would <HI>keep us back from pre&s;umptuous Sins, that they may not have Dominion over us; for then &s;hall we be upright and innocent from the great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The Sermon preach'd by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Shurtleff</HI> on the Execution Day, being well adap|ted to the Occa&s;ion, was very acceptable to all the Auditors, and is publi&s;h'd at the De&s;ire of &s;undry of them: And, that the Ble&s;&s;ing of Hea|ven may accompany it to all the Readers, is the &s;incere De&s;ire</P>

<P>_THAT which has occa&s;ion'd this mighty Concour&s;e, and bro't us in &s;uch a Multitude to the Hou&s;e of God, will without Doubt be acknowledg'd to be a very <HI>awful and affecting Providence.</HI></P>
<P>And, it being thought proper while we have this <HI>mournful Spectacle</HI> before us, and are beholding One that has receiv'd the Sentence of Death, is ju&s;t now going to &s;uffer according to it, that
<PB N="2" REF="004599_0008_100DA9F520A53D20">
&s;omething &s;hould be offer'd in this publick Way, as well for the <HI>Benefit of the whole Audience,</HI> as for the <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the condemn'd Per&s;on</HI> Her&s;elf in the&s;e her la&s;t Hours; and it being my Lot to have the difficult Task devolv'd upon me, I have thought of the Pa&s;&s;age read to you, as that which may &s;ugge&s;t &s;omething that is proper and perti|nent to the &s;ad and &s;orrowful Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Words, you are &s;en&s;ible, were &s;poken <HI>by a dying Malefactor to his dying Saviour.</HI> The pre|fix'd Period of laying open the mo&s;t bloody and di&s;mal Scene that was ever beheld under the Sun, <HI>viz&punc;</HI> the Crucifixion of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, being now arriv'd; among other Circum&s;tances that attended it, we are told in the preceding Parts of the Chapter, (agreable to what was long be|fore predicted, that he &s;hould <HI>be number'd with the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors</HI>) that there were <HI>two Malefactors led forth with him to be put to Death</HI>; who were accord|ingly <HI>crucified</HI> with him, the <HI>one on his right Hand, and the other on his left:</HI> And in the Text, and the immediately foregoing Ver&s;es, we have an Ac+count in what Manner the&s;e Malefactors con|ducted them&s;elves.</P>
<P>One of them, &s;ays the Evangeli&s;t Ver. 39, <HI>railed on him, &s;aying, If thou be the</HI> CHRIST, <HI>&s;ave thy &s;elf and us: But the other rebuked him,</HI> and di&s;co|vers him&s;elf to be a &s;incere and real Penitent. It is indeed &s;aid in the two preceding Evangeli&s;ts, that <HI>the Thieves that were crucified with him, reviled him:</HI> And accordingly &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, that they both did &s;o at fir&s;t, 'till the Heart of one of them was wonderfully and &s;uddenly chang'd. But it is the more general, and, I think, much more pro|bable Opinion, that it was but <HI>one of them that
<PB N="3" REF="004599_0009_100DA9F6D06EB5F8">
reviled,</HI> as is here related by St. <HI>Luke:</HI> And, as to its being el&s;ewhere affirm'd of <HI>both;</HI> it's ob&s;erv'd to be u&s;ual with the Evangeli&s;ts, and common in the Jewi&s;h Style, to a&s;cribe that to <HI>many,</HI> that a|grees only to <HI>one</HI> Nay, &s;o far are &s;ome from al|lowing that he, who approv'd him&s;elf penitent, at fir&s;t <HI>rail'd with the other,</HI> that they conceive he <HI>began his Repentance</HI> before: But, when&s;oever it fir&s;t began, whether in the Pri&s;on, or upon the Cro&s;s, con&s;idering the extraordinary Circum|&s;tances of the Ca&s;e, it can give no ju&s;t Encour|agement to the Sinner to put off this Work to the la&s;t. But as I may have Occa&s;ion to &s;ay &s;ome|thing further to the Point, before I fini&s;h my Di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall wave is for the pre&s;ent, and only &s;ay that from what Period &s;oever we &s;uppo&s;e the Repentance of this dying Malefactor to bear Date, it was doubtle&s;s <HI>genuine and true:</HI> And this what he here &s;ays to his Fellow-Sufferer, &s;eems plainly to &s;hew: <HI>He rebuked him, &s;aying, Do&s;t not thou fear God, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame Condemna|tion? and we indeed ju&s;tly; for we receive the due Reward of our Deeds: But this Man hath done no|thing ami&s;s.</HI> And then we are told that <HI>he &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom.</HI> The&s;e are the Words I am now to &s;peak to. And could I upon the Warning I have had, have redeemed &s;o much Time from my o|ther nece&s;&s;ary Employments, as to have prepar'd a ju&s;t and full Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Subject, I could not have had Time allow'd me for the Delivery of it. I mu&s;t therefore content my&s;elf with a few Hints.</P>
<P>And all, that I &s;hall attempt at pre&s;ent, &s;hall be as follows,
<LIST>
<PB N="4" REF="004599_0010_100DA9FA08624168">
<ITEM>I. To <HI>con&s;ider &s;ome great and weighty Truths, of which this dying Per&s;on was, and which we all may be in the firm Belief and Per&s;wa&s;ion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. To <HI>con&s;ider the Prayer, which he put up; and which all ought to put up con&s;equent upon &s;uch a belief, e&s;pecially if in the like Circum&s;tances</HI>:</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. To <HI>con&s;ider the Manner in which he puts up this Prayer, and in which it becomes every one to do it in the like Time and Ca&s;e</HI>; if he would hope for the Succe&s;s he met with:</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And then to make &s;ome &s;uitable <HI>Application</HI> of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">I. Then, I am here to <HI>con&s;ider &s;ome great and weighty Truths, in which this dying Per&s;on was, and which all may be in the firm Belief and Per&s;wa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>And in the</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t Place, He <HI>firmly believ'd, that, after his Death and Departure out of this World, he was to exi&s;t and live in another State.</HI> Otherwi&s;e, what would it have avail'd him, for his <HI>Lord to remember him when he came into his Kingdom?</HI> He had nothing to ask as to this World, being con&s;cious, that he was now taking his la&s;t Leave of it: So that he plainly asks for &s;ome Favour beyond it. From whence it is evident, that he was verily per&s;wa|ded of a <HI>future World.</HI> And who, that is in the Exerci&s;e of his Rea&s;on, and that does not turn away his Ear from li&s;tning to its Dictates, can po&s;&s;ibly doubt of <HI>his future Exi&s;tence</HI>?</P>
<P>When we look within our&s;elves, and take a View of the <HI>noble Faculties</HI> we are furni&s;h'd with,
<PB N="5" REF="004599_0011_100DA9FCD7E7D7B0">
how can we forbear concluding, that in this Body there dwells a Soul or Spirit that is imma|terial, and in its own Nature immortal?</P>
<P>And then, if, from reflecting upon the&s;e Facul|ties, we proceed to the Con&s;ideration of the Bre|vity of human Life, &s;hall we think it likely, that a Creature endued with &s;uch Powers, capable of &s;uch Improvements, and form'd with Expectati|ons, after having continued here for a little Space, &s;hould lo&s;e his Exi&s;tence, and not lay it down for a Certainty, that <HI>he was de&s;ign'd for another State</HI>?</P>
<P>Nay, if it were only upon ob&s;erving the pro|mi&s;cuous Di&s;tribution of Events to good and bad Men in this Life, how &s;hould we be puzzled to reconcile it with the moral Perfections of God, without the Suppo&s;ition of another life?</P>
<P>But then we are not left to find out this Truth by the bare Light of Rea&s;on; but it is manife&s;t from divine Revelation: And, if we look into the Scriptures, e&s;pecially of the New-Te&s;tament, we &s;hall find not only the <HI>Immortality of the Soul,</HI> but the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Body</HI> a&s;&s;erted and ex|emplified to us.</P>
<P>We may then be verily per&s;waded, that after our Death and Departure out of this World, we are to exi&s;t and live in another State. Indeed the Belief of this great Truth is &s;uch a Trouble and Di&s;turbance to a great many in their &s;inful Pur|&s;uits, that they would fain get rid of it, and may po&s;&s;ibly &s;o far root it out of their Minds, as to have hardly any Sen&s;e and Apprehen&s;ion of it in their pro&s;perous Sea&s;ons: But, in a <HI>Time of Ad|ver&s;ity,</HI> e&s;pecially in the <HI>Hour of Death,</HI> the Evi|dences
<PB N="6" REF="004599_0012_100DA9FEC1A2D6A8">
of it ordinarily appear in their full Force: And they are fully convinc'd that they are not about to be turn'd out of Being, but only to re|move from one World to another, and to pa&s;s from a State of Probation, to a State of Retribu|tion.</P>
<P>And hence, by the Way, What a &s;erious and awful Thing is it to die? I may appeal to the <HI>mi&s;erable Object</HI> I have now before me, whether &s;he does not find it to be &s;o? Yea, I may appeal to all of you, whether it would not appear to be &s;o to you in the like Ca&s;e? And whether it be not Matter of Surprize, even at an uncertain Di&s;|tance, to think &s;eriou&s;ly of pa&s;&s;ing the dark Entry of Eternity, through which, as you go right or wrong, you are made, or undone for ever? To think of putting off this fle&s;hly Tabernacle; of your Spirits appearing &s;eperately before your great LORD, and of being fix'd in an everla&s;ting State?</P>
<P>But I proceed to the Con&s;ideration of a <HI>&s;econd</HI> great and weighty Truth of which the dying Per|&s;on &s;poken of in the Text, was in the firm Belief, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That CHRIST, <HI>who was now leaving this World, was going to his Kingdom, and &s;o would have Authority to di&s;po&s;e of him after Death.</HI> And accord|ingly we may be verily per&s;waded, that he is actually gone into his Kingdom; that he is &s;eat|ed upon his Throne, and has the determining of our future State. <HI>Remember me,</HI> &s;ays his Thief upon the Cro&s;s to his dying LORD, <HI>when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom</HI>; which plainly declares his Belief, that he was going into his Kingdom:
<PB N="7" REF="004599_0013_100DAA00E0BE7628">
And accordingly we find him telling his Di&s;ci|ples after his Re&s;urrection, Mat. xxviii.18. That <HI>all Power was given him in Heaven and Earth.</HI> In|deed as God, all Power was originally in him: In this Sen&s;e <HI>his Kingdom</HI> and Dominion was <HI>from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting:</HI> But the Kingdom, &s;po|ken of in the Text, is that, which as GOD-Man, or Mediator, he is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of; which he receiv'd partly in Recompence for what he had done and &s;uffered in the Work of our Redemption. Agre|ably we read, Philip. ii.9. That, <HI>becau&s;e he had humbled him&s;elf, therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name: That at the Name of Je&s;us,</HI> or as it may be read, <HI>in the Name of</HI> JESUS; that is, in the Acknowledge|ment of his &s;overeign Power, <HI>every Knee &s;hould bow.</HI></P>
<P>We may all then be verily per&s;waded that he, whom the Text &s;peaks of as <HI>going,</HI> is <HI>gone into his Kingdom:</HI> That he <HI>is &s;et down at the right Hand of the Throne of GOD:</HI> That <HI>the Government is upon his Shoulders</HI>: That all Per&s;ons &amp; Things are put in Subjection to him; &amp; that he has a &s;overeign Pow|er to di&s;po&s;e of us at his Plea&s;ure. It is he, that has the ordering of us, and of all Events that concern us, in this World: It is he al&s;o, that determines the Time and Manner of our going out of this World: And then, when we come into another, it is he that has the Di&s;po&s;al of us: <HI>I,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>am he that liveth, and was dead, and am alive for ever|more, and have the Keys of Hell,</HI> that is, of Hades, or the un&s;een World, <HI>and of Death,</HI> Revel, i.18. It is he, that determines the State of our Souls, and di&s;po&s;es of them in a State of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery, when they fir&s;t leave the Body: It is he al&s;o, that will have the Deci&s;ion of our Ca&s;e, that
<PB N="8" REF="004599_0014_100DAA03021E01E8">
will pronounce us either <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> or <HI>cur&s;ed</HI>; that will &s;entence us either to <HI>inherit a Kingdom,</HI> or <HI>to go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment</HI> at the Re&s;ur|rection and final Judgment.</P>
<P>And hence, by the Way, How worthy is he to be reverenc'd and obey'd? Of what Concernment it to us to yield an entire Subjection to him? And how &s;tupid mu&s;t we be to content our&s;elves till we are in good Terms with him? He is in|deed the mo&s;t proper Object of our Love, and ought to be incomparably amiable in our Eyes: But then there is al&s;o the utmo&s;t Reverence due to him: Shall we not &s;tand in Awe of him, who has &s;uch an ab&s;olute Dominion over us, and be afraid of trampling upon his Laws, who has the Keys of Death and Hell, who has a Right to di&s;|po&s;e of us both here and hereafter, and is at the Head of all Principalities and Powers? Shall we refu&s;e that he &s;hould reign over us, who is gone into the Heavens, and is at the <HI>right Hand of God, Angels, Authorities and Powers being made &s;ubject to him,</HI> as 1 Pet. iii.21.</P>

<P>And &s;o I come to the</P>
<P N="2">II. General Head propos'd in &s;peaking to the Words, which was, To <HI>con&s;ider of the Prayer the dying Per&s;on in the Text puts up, and which all which ought to put up con&s;equent upon the Belief</HI> of the foregoing Truths, <HI>e&s;pecially in the like Cir|cum&s;tances.</HI> Being verily per&s;waded of his own future Exi&s;tence, and that the dying JESUS was about to be exalted at the right Hand of GOD, and to enter upon the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his regal Power, and &s;o would have the di&s;po&s;ing of him after Death, He makes this Reque&s;t, <HI>LORD, re|member me, when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom. Re|member me,</HI> that is, <HI>remember me for Good</HI>: Or <HI>remem|ber me &s;o as to &s;hew Favour</HI> to me: He does not pre&s;cribe to him, how far, and in what Degree he &s;hould do it: But he dreads the Tho't of being utterly rejected, and begs that he might not whol|ly fall &s;hort of his Mercy. And, as he prayed to Chri&s;t as <HI>going,</HI> we are to pray to him as <HI>gone into his Kingdom</HI>; and as having <HI>all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him,</HI> that <HI>he would remember us for Good,</HI> and <HI>&s;hew Favour to us in the other World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004599_0016_100DAA07015D9048">And further, to prove that this ought to be the Matter of our Prayer, I need only put you in Mind, what an ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ing it is, and how much it mu&s;t needs be the Object of our De&s;ire. It is a Thing greatly to be de&s;ir'd, that CHRIST in his Kingdom would think upon us for Good while we are in this World, and when we are departing out of it: That, as we are <HI>walking thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death,</HI> he would take a favourable Notice of us, and let no needful Sup|ports and Con&s;olations be wanting to us. But it is more e&s;pecially to be de&s;ir'd, that we may have his kind Remembrance when we come into the other World; whether upon our immediate De|parture, or at the Re&s;urrection and final Judg|ment.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is infinitely worthy of our De&s;ire, and ought therefore to be the Matter of our Prayer, that we may be <HI>thus remember'd by CHRIST in his Kingdom immediately upon our Death and Departure out of this World</HI> If he, who is the Lord of Para|di&s;e, and has the Keys of it in his keeping, be not merciful to us, what will become of us? If we are then excluded from his Favour and Protecti|on, what can we expect, but that our Souls, as &s;oon as ever they quit their pre&s;ent Habitations, will fall as a Prey into the Hands of that roaring Lion, who has always greedily &s;ought to devour them? What, but that they will be carried away to &s;ome or other of tho&s;e helli&s;h Dens; where, be&s;ides the Tortures we &s;hall receive from tho&s;e mercile&s;s Spirits, to who&s;e Company we &s;hall now be perpetually confin'd, we &s;hall undergo in|finitely more than we can at pre&s;ent conceive from our own awaken'd and enrag'd Con&s;cience, that biting Worm that &s;hall never dy, and from
<PB N="11" REF="004599_0017_100DAA09EC1F16F8">
the Wrath of an omnipotent GOD, that fierce and flaming <HI>Fire that will never be quench'd.</HI> But, if upon our leaving this World, our exalted and glorified LORD be pleas'd to think upon us for Good, and to di&s;po&s;e of us in a State of Happi|ne&s;s, &s;ome of tho&s;e Angels, that attend upon him, and pay their cheerful Subjection to him, &s;hall have Charge concerning our departed Spi|rits; who &s;hall defend them from the helli&s;h Ho&s;ts, that &s;tand ready to devour them, and con|duct them &s;afe to the bli&s;sful Habitations provid|ed for them; where they &s;hall obtain a compleat Re&s;t from Sin and Sorrow, where they &s;hall be like to CHRIST, and &s;ee him as he is; where their Faculties &s;hall be va&s;tly improv'd; where they &s;hall join the &s;weet and agreable Society of Angels and perfected Spirits, and be perpetually exerci&s;ed in the mo&s;t noble Employments, till the Re&s;urrection and final Judgment. And &s;o I come to &s;ay</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is a Thing infinitely worthy of our De&s;ire, that CHRIST, <HI>who is gone into his King|dom, and will in that Day &s;it upon the Throne of his Glory, may &s;o remember us as to &s;hew Mercy to us.</HI> We have full A&s;&s;urance that there is &s;uch a Day approaching: A Day, when our ble&s;&s;ed LORD, who now &s;its at the right Hand of GOD, &s;hall <HI>come in his Glory, when he &s;hall de&s;cend from Heaven with a Shout&punc; with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and the Trump of GOD:</HI> When <HI>all that are in their Graves &s;hall hear his Voice and come forth,</HI> and when <HI>Quick and Dead &s;hall appear</HI> before him. So that, in a Sen&s;e, he may then be &s;aid to <HI>remember us all,</HI> there being no one of the whole Race of <HI>Adam</HI> that &s;hall e&s;cape his Notice and Regard. But the Thing &s;o much to be de&s;ir'd is, that <HI>he would re|member
<PB N="12" REF="004599_0018_100DAA0CDF24EA68">
us for Good, and &s;o as to &s;hew Mercy to us.</HI> Without this, what a mi&s;erable State &s;hall we be in? If we are of the Number of tho&s;e, to whom he &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>I know you not,</HI> how di&s;mal will be the Sound? Oh! the hideous Shrieks and bitter Outcries, that will be heard at the pronouncing of that dreadful Sentence, <HI>Go ye cur&s;ed into ever|la&s;ting Fire, prepar'd for the Devil and his Angels!</HI> Who can conceive the thou&s;andth Part of the Mi&s;ery and Torment that is included in it, and which tho&s;e forlorn Wretches, that fall under it, mu&s;t forever endure? But, if our great LORD be then pleas'd to think upon us for Good, and we are rank'd among his Favourites and Friends, what can we de&s;ire more to compleat our Feli|city? With what ravi&s;hing Plea&s;ures &s;hall our Minds then abound and overflow to behold our LORD placing us at his right Hand, and to hear him &s;aying to us, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepar'd for you from the Founda|tion of the World</HI>? With what Songs of Joy and Victory &s;hall we return with him to the City of the living GOD? And how faint, how imperfect, and inadequate are the mo&s;t exalted Ideas, we are now able to form to our&s;elves of the ineffable Delights we &s;hall uninterruptedly partake of throughout eternal Ages? Thus you &s;ee how worthy it is of our De&s;ire, and con&s;equently how much it becomes us to make it our Prayer, <HI>that CHRIST would remember us now he is in his King|dom,</HI> and during the Exerci&s;e of that royal Power, with which, as Mediator, he is inve&s;ted: We are to pray, that he would <HI>remember us at Death,</HI> and that he would <HI>remember us at the Re&s;urrection</HI>; that he, who has the Deci&s;ion of our Ca&s;e, would <HI>&s;hew us Mercy, and determine us to a State of Hap|pine&s;s</HI>: We are to be often making this Prayer

in the Time of our Life and Health: But it is e&s;pecially proper in the Time of our Death: And it very well becomes tho&s;e that die, as did the Malefactor &s;poken of in the Text. And &s;o I come to the</P>
<P N="3">III. Thing propos'd, which was, To <HI>con&s;ider the Manner in which he puts up this Prayer, and in which it becomes every one to do it in the like Time and Ca&s;e,</HI> if he would hope for the Succe&s;s he met with. That the Prayer of this dying Male|factor was <HI>prevalent and effectual,</HI> we may learn from the Ver&s;e immediately following our Text. Having &s;aid unto JESUS, <HI>LORD, remember me, when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom</HI>; we are told, that <HI>JESUS &s;aid unto him, Verily I &s;ay unto thee, To Day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.</HI> And the Manner, in which he puts up this Prayer, and in which it becomes <HI>all</HI> in the like Time and Ca&s;e, to put up the &s;ame, may be learn'd from the Text and the preceding Ver&s;es.</P>
<P>And here, I &s;hall in&s;tance in a few Things, which de&s;erve to be more fully in&s;i&s;ted on, than the Time will allow of at pre&s;ent. And</P>
<P N="1">1. The Per&s;on here &s;poken of, <HI>makes this Prayer in the Exerci&s;e of a &s;trong and active Faith;</HI> and &s;o <HI>mu&s;t every one in the like Ca&s;e, that expects to be heard, accepted and ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> The <HI>Faith</HI> of this dying Ma|lefactor, is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure evident from what has been already &s;aid: And what is related in the Context is abundantly expre&s;&s;ive of <HI>it</HI>: He profe&s;&s;es his Belief concerning JESUS, that <HI>he had done nothing ami&s;s</HI>; and con&s;equently that, in &s;uffering as an Impo&s;ter, he &s;uffer'd wrongfully, that he was the very Per&s;on he profe&s;s'd him&s;elf
<PB N="14" REF="004599_0020_100DAA109853B110">
to be, even <HI>a Prophet &s;ent from GOD</HI>: And then, being convinc'd that he was perfectly innocent, and had no Sin to &s;uffer for of his own, he was doubtle&s;s per&s;waded, that he &s;uffered for the Sins of others: That <HI>he was cut off to make Re|conciliation for Iniquity, and to bring in everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and therefore tru&s;ted to the Merit of his Sacrifice: Thus he implicitly acknow|ledges him as <HI>Prophet</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;t</HI>; and expre&s;ly owns him as <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> &amp; &s;ubmits him&s;elf to him as &s;uch: And all this he does at a Time, when he was in the very Depth of Di&s;grace: Such was the Faith that he was in the Exerci&s;e of &mdash;And, with &s;omething of the like Belief in CHRIST, of the like Reliance upon him, and entire Re&s;ignation to him, does it become all in the like Circum&s;tances to make the foregoing Prayer, as they would hope for Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. The dying Per&s;on &s;poken of in the Text, puts up the Prayer here recorded, <HI>in the Exerci&s;e of a &s;incere and fervent Love.</HI>&mdash;And &s;o mu&s;t <HI>every one</HI> in the like Ca&s;e, if he expects the like graci|ous An&s;wer that he met with. <HI>His Love to GOD and CHRIST is evident,</HI> in that he could not for|bear manife&s;ting his Di&s;like of the Irreverence and Di&s;re&s;pect that were &s;hewn to them by his Fel|low-Sufferer: And his Love to his Neighbour is evident, from the Rebuke he admini&s;ters to him and the Concern he expre&s;&s;es for him: And, in the Exerci&s;e of the like Love to GOD and CHRIST, and the like charitable Di&s;po&s;ition to|wards Men, are we all, while living, but e&s;peci|ally when dying, to put up this Reque&s;t, <HI>That CHRIST would remember us</HI> now <HI>he is in his King|dom;</HI> even with Minds free from all manner of
<PB N="15" REF="004599_0021_100DAA13EBAA7F50">
Ill-Will to tho&s;e, who, we conceive, have been injurious to us, or we can't expect to prevail.</P>
<P>Again;</P>
<P N="3">3. It was <HI>in the Exerci&s;e of a deep Repentance,</HI> that the condemn'd and dying Per&s;on here &s;poken of, makes this Prayer: And in the like penitent Frame mu&s;t every one put up this Reque&s;t, if he hopes to &s;ucceed, as he did. He was fully appre|hen&s;ive how unworthily he had behav'd towards GOD, and how ill he had de&s;erv'd at his Hands: <HI>Do&s;t not thou fear GOD,</HI> &s;ays he to his Fellow, <HI>&s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame Condemnation; and we in|deed ju&s;tly, for we receive the Reward of our Deeds.</HI> Yea he doubtle&s;s &s;aw him&s;elf worthy not only of Death, but of Hell; was &s;uitably affected with the Con&s;ideration of it, and &s;en&s;ible that nothing but infinite Mercy could re&s;cue him from it. And in the &s;ame Manner ought all dying Per&s;ons, e&s;pecially all dying Malefactors, to make this Prayer to their exalted LORD and Saviour, if they expect that it &s;hould be prevalent and effec|tual, viz. That he would <HI>remember them</HI> now he is <HI>in his Kingdom:</HI> They mu&s;t &s;ee their Sins, as be|ing odious and offen&s;ive to GOD, and as laying them open to his Vengeance: They mu&s;t take Notice of the Hand of God in what has befallen them &amp; own that it is but the ju&s;t Recompence of their Doings: Yea, they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that they have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to greater Mi&s;eries than have befallen them, or that can befall them, in this World, and that they might ju&s;tly be <HI>puni&s;h'd with everla&s;ting De&s;truction from the Pre&s;ence of the LORD, and from the Glory of his Power</HI>: They are there|fore to ca&s;t them&s;elves down at his Feet, and to place their only Hope in his free and &s;overeign
<PB N="16" REF="004599_0022_100DAA16915758A8">
Grace, <HI>looking for the Mercy of our LORD JESUS CHRIST unto eternal Life.</HI> And then, once more,</P>
<P>It is <HI>with the utmo&s;t Fervency,</HI> that the dying Per&s;on, whom the Text &s;peaks of, makes this Prayer; and in the &s;ame Manner mu&s;t every one put up this Reque&s;t to his LORD and Saviour, if he hopes for the Succe&s;s he met with. His Words, as One notes,
<Q>carry an Air of Importu|nity in them: When he &s;ays, <HI>LORD, remember me</HI>; he as it were breathes out his very Soul in his Prayer. It is as if he had &s;aid, <HI>LORD, do but remember me,</HI> and I have enough; <HI>I de&s;ire no more; into thy Hands I commit my Ca&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
And thus does it become <HI>every one</HI> when he makes this Prayer in the like Ca&s;e, if he would do it to any Purpo&s;e, to do it with the <HI>utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s and Fervour of Soul</HI>: He mu&s;t pray with the <HI>Importu|nity</HI> that the va&s;t Importance of the Thing re|quires: He mu&s;t <HI>plead</HI> with his great LORD, as one that is pleading <HI>for Life, even an immortal Life,</HI> and mu&s;t <HI>&s;trive and agonize in his Prayer,</HI> as one that can't tell how to be denied.</P>
<P>Thus I have as briefly as po&s;&s;ible <HI>con&s;ider'd &s;ome great Truths in which this dying Per&s;on was, and which all may be in the firm Belief and Per&s;wa&s;ion;</HI> as al&s;o <HI>the Prayer which he put up, and all ought to put up in Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Belief:</HI> And the <HI>Manner in which he put up this Prayer, and in which it con|cerns every one to do it,</HI> if he would hope for the like Succe&s;s that he had.</P>
<P>All then, that remains, is to make &s;ome &s;uitable <HI>Application</HI> of what has been &s;aid: And here,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="17" REF="004599_0023_100DAA1856F578D0">1. With the tendere&s;t Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion, and the deepe&s;t Concern of Soul, I would apply my&s;elf to the <HI>poor Pri&s;oner,</HI> who&s;e mi&s;erable Ca&s;e has occa&s;ion'd this va&s;t and numerous A&s;&s;embly: And in a few Words let me exhort you, that you would <HI>in a becoming Manner make the Prayer of the condemned and dying Per&s;on,</HI> that has been now put into your Mouth.</P>
<P>You are, I tru&s;t, verily per&s;waded of that which you will mo&s;t certainly find to be true, that, as you are leaving this, you are going into another World, and are to exi&s;t and live forever in a future State: I take it for granted, that you are al&s;o per&s;waded that CHRIST, who is gone into his Kingdom, has Authority to di&s;po&s;e of you; and that accordingly, being by and by, even within an Hour or two more, to appear be|fore him, he will then determine your State; and you will be unalterably fix'd in a Condition of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery: And, believing this, how can you forbear breathing out this Reque&s;t, <HI>LORD, remember me, now thou art in thy Kingdom</HI>?</P>
<P>It ought to be, and I tru&s;t is, Matter of deep Hu|miliation to you, and the great Grief and Burden of your Soul, that you have liv'd &s;o much in the <HI>Neglect of Prayer, and other religious Duties,</HI> in the Time pa&s;t of your Life, whereby you have pro|voked GOD to leave you to a great many Sins, and particularly to the Sin, that has brought you to this ignominious Death. And, as you have rejected CHRIST in your pro&s;perous Sea&s;ons, when he has called you, you having one Time after another refu&s;ed; you mu&s;t acknowledge, that it would be ju&s;t with him, to reject you,
<PB N="18" REF="004599_0024_100DAA19FB288800">
and turn a deaf Ear to your Cry now in the Time of your Calamity and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But yet don't ab&s;olutely de&s;pond; but &s;o far encourage your&s;elf as to make your humble Ap|plication to him: And be &s;ure to do it in the Manner that has been now pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>See to it, that you make this Prayer to CHRIST in the due <HI>Exerci&s;e of Faith</HI>; with an entire Sur|render of your&s;elf to him, and a firm and &s;tedfa&s;t Reliance upon him. Again,</P>
<P>Put up this Prayer in the <HI>Exerci&s;e of Love to</HI> GOD <HI>and CHRIST, and of univer&s;al Benevolence and Charity to Men.</HI></P>
<P>Do it al&s;o under a <HI>penitent Sen&s;e of your Sins</HI>; &s;orrowing that you have offended and di&s;honour|ed a glorious and gracious GOD. Acknowlege the Equity of what has befallen you: That you are <HI>receiving the Reward of your Doings</HI>: Yea, that you are ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to greater and more amazing Mi&s;eries. But yet have Recour&s;e to <HI>&s;overeign Grace,</HI> and let your &s;ole Dependance be upon it.</P>
<P>And then, Let this Prayer be put up to your glorified Lord and Saviour, with all <HI>po&s;&s;ible Ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and Ardour of Soul:</HI> Plead your Nece&s;&s;ity of an Intere&s;t in him, and the inconceivable Mi|&s;ery you mu&s;t incur without it: Say,
<Q>I am un|done, for ever undone, unle&s;s thou wilt think upon me for Good, <HI>&s;ave me Lord, or I peri&s;h.</HI></Q>
Plead al&s;o his infinite Compa&s;&s;ion to poor peri&s;h|ing Sinners: Say to him,
<Q>Was it not in Love to the Souls of Men that thou wer't pleas'd to

Art thou not now <HI>touch'd with the feeling of our Infir|mities,</HI> and affected with our Mi&s;eries? LORD, <HI>pity me in this my Time of Need.</HI> LORD, <HI>remem|ber me, have Mercy upon me, and receive my Spirit.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And, if you look to him in the Manner you have been now directed to, you may hope to be heard and accepted of your gracious LORD, and that <HI>this Day,</HI> you &s;hall <HI>be with him in Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>

Con&s;ider, that the GOD, to who&s;e View they are expos'd, may before you are aware and in a Way you little think of, <HI>bring to Light tho&s;e hidden Things of Darkne&s;s:</HI> And you may be brought to Puni&s;hment on the Ac|count of them: Take Heed then, le&s;t the Hea|vens reveal your Iniquity, and the Earth ri&s;e up again&s;t you: And be prevail'd with to betake your &s;elves to the Exerci&s;e of a &s;peedy &amp; deep Repentance towards GOD, and to <HI>put away the Evil of your Doings from before his Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Let me al&s;o exhort all &s;uch of you as allow your&s;elves in the Neglect and Abu&s;e of GOD's Sabbaths; (which the condemn'd Per&s;on here pre&s;ent reflects upon with &s;o much Regret) and in &s;uch like Sins as make Way for others, and very often lead to Capital Crimes, to beware of per&s;i&s;ting in them, <HI>le&s;t you al&s;o Mourn at the la&s;t,</HI> and &s;ay&punc; <HI>How have we hated In&s;truction, and our Souls de&s;pi&s;ed Reproof?</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, Whatever are the Sins of Heart or Life you have any of you hitherto indulg'd, be per&s;waded to give your&s;elves no Re&s;t till you are effectually reclaim'd and turn'd from them to
<PB N="22" REF="004599_0028_100DAA219CFFA908">
GOD; that &s;o you may the more confidently expect and pray to be <HI>remembred for Good, and to obtain Mercy from your great</HI> LORD, when you come into that other World, to which you mu&s;t quickly and may &s;uddenly remove.</P>
<P>But here perhaps you may be ready to object,
<Q>That there is no need of your making &s;o much Ha&s;te to leave your Sins and to return to GOD and your Duty, but that you may &s;afely put it off to the Clo&s;e of your Days; that it will &s;uf|fice to make this Prayer at the la&s;t:</Q>
And may be apt to bring this In&s;tance of the Thief upon the Cro&s;s as an Evidence of it.</P>
<P>But, if this Per&s;on's Conver&s;ion was begun during his Impri&s;onment, which as it has been hinted to you, is what &s;ome have conjectur'd, the Argument utterly fails, and there is no Force at all in it.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be otherwi&s;e, and that, to keep Men from ab&s;olute De&s;pair, there &s;hould be this one in&s;tance in our Bible of one who at the la&s;t Hour was thus heard and accepted in his Prayer: Seeing this is the only one, and atten|ded with very extraordinary Circum&s;tances, that Man can hardly be thought to be in his Wits, that &s;hould take any great Encouragement from it. "It was done, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Works, Page 385.</NOTE>, at the Time of CHRIST's Suffering; a Sea&s;on, wherein GOD, in that one Act of the Redempti- of his Son, expre&s;s'd the very utmo&s;t of his Mer|cy. and di&s;cover'd unto the World as it were in
<PB N="23" REF="004599_0029_100DAA23520098C8">
one entire Sum, <HI>all the Riches and Trea&s;ures of his Goodne&s;s:</HI> If therefore he was pleas'd at &s;uch a Time to Work a Miracle of Mercy, what Ground can any have from hence to expect it in ordinary Ca&s;es?"</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, It is probable, that this Per&s;on had never before enjoy'd, and therefore could not abu&s;e the Day and Means of Grace, and &s;o could not incur the like Guilt that we do, in putting off our Repentance, who live under the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>And who&s;oever is embolden'd from this Ex|ample to defer it to the la&s;t, pre&s;uming that he &s;hall then <HI>find Mercy,</HI> (&s;hould he have the Oppor|tunity to ask for it, which is too great an Uncer|tainty for any one to depend upon) will mo&s;t probably find him&s;elf deceiv'd.</P>
<P>Let none then dare any longer to delay this great and nece&s;&s;ary Work: But if you are yet in Bondage to any of your Lu&s;ts; let me entreat you, that you would not re&s;t &s;atisfied until you are deliver'd from &s;o ba&s;e and dangerous a Servi|tude, and have in good Earne&s;t &s;ubjected your &s;elves to the Yoke and Government of CHRIST.</P>
<P>In a Word, Let us all cordially embrace and obey his Go&s;pel, and labour more and more to conduct our&s;elves as becomes his Di&s;ciples: <HI>Lay|ing a&s;ide every Weight, and the Sins that do mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et us, let us run with Patience the Race &s;et before us; looking unto JESUS, the Author and Fini&s;her of our Faith</HI>; and be continually a&s;piring after a nearer Conformity to his <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Example,</HI> that &s;o, when we are taking Leave of this World, we may with the greater Confidence pray
<PB N="24" REF="004599_0030_100DAA2664CE3DC0">
<HI>that he would remember us when we come into the other World:</HI> And he will then be a&s;&s;uredly mindful of us at Death and the Re&s;urrection, and make us compleatly and inconceivably happy for ever and ever, AMEN and AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>A Brief NARRATIVE Concerning the CRIMINALS, Who&s;e Execution was the Occa&s;ion of the preceding Sermon.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the Preface to that Di&s;cour&s;e, it is &s;ugge&s;ted, how the&s;e Per&s;ons came to be detected, and bro't to Puni&s;h|ment: And, leaving it to the Rea|der to make proper and pertinent Re|flections upon the <HI>remarkable Di&s;covery of their Crimes, and the My&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s of Divine Providence, in &s;uffering a third Per&s;on,</HI> as it now &s;eems probable, one it may be more gro&s;ly guilty than them&s;elves, and by who&s;e Means they have been di&s;cover'd, <HI>as yet to e&s;cape</HI>: Whether for <HI>Mercy or Judgment</HI> to the particular Per&s;on, and for what De&s;igns as to others, though doubtle&s;s for wi&s;e and good Purpo&s;es, mu&s;t be re&s;erv'd to <HI>the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD.</HI> I &s;hall now give a very &s;hort Account of their <HI>Behaviour after their Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004599_0032_100DAA29F5ACBCE8">No &s;ooner had they receiv'd their Sentence, which was upon the 30th Day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t, but &s;eem'd to be <HI>deeply &s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;erable State, and to apply them&s;elves with a great deal of Care to prepare for their Death.</HI> But, after &s;ome Time, a Notion being &s;ugge&s;ted to them of attempting an E&s;cape and being per&s;waded by &s;ome indi&s;creet Per&s;ons who came to vi&s;it them, that their Sen|tence was rigorous and unju&s;t, and that upon due Application they might obtain a Reprieve &s;o as to be finally excu&s;ed from &s;uffering: The&s;e Things &s;eem'd to have an ill Influence (e&s;pecially upon one of them) and to <HI>divert their Minds from Things of the greate&s;t Importance</HI> for a while. But, for &s;ome Time before their Death, they appear'd, to have <HI>laid a&s;ide the&s;e Thoughts, and to &s;et them|&s;elves with all Diligence to work out their Salvation, and to &s;ecure their future well-being.</HI></P>
<P>One of them, viz. <HI>Sarah Simp&s;on,</HI> a Widow Wo|man, of about 27 Years of Age, was born in the Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Oy&s;ter-River,</HI> now the Town of <HI>Durham.</HI> She was put out young, and &s;erv'd her Appren|tice&s;hip in <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> She was one, that had a good Degree of Under&s;tanding: And, tho' &s;he &s;adly bewail'd <HI>her Negligence and Folly, in making no better a U&s;e of the Opportunities</HI> &s;he had enjoy'd of acquainting her&s;elf with Things of a religi|ous Nature; yet &s;he was not, when fir&s;t confin'd, <HI>remarkably ignorant upon that Account, but made great Proficiency in Knowledge</HI> during her impri&s;onment: The Mini&s;ters of the Town making it their con|&s;tant Bu&s;ine&s;s to in&s;truct her, as well as pray with her: And being al&s;o occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the neighbouring Mini&s;ters and other good People, who offered her all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance they
<PB N="27" REF="004599_0033_100DAA2CA43948F0">
could. The Way of publick Wor&s;hip to which &s;he had been us'd, was the Way practic'd by the Churches in this Country: Accordingly &s;he went every <HI>Lords-Day</HI> to the Place of Wor&s;hip, where &s;he had been formerly wont to attend. And, on the <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> before her Execution, &s;he de&s;ir'd a Paper might be read, wherein &s;he in a very moving Manner, <HI>ask'd the Prayers of all GOD's People for her,</HI> as it was the la&s;t Time &s;he was ever like to have the Benefit of them upon &s;uch a Day: Taking Occa&s;ion at the &s;ame Time to <HI>bewail her Breach of GOD's Sabbaths,</HI> which &s;he declar'd, <HI>lay peculiarly heavy upon her Spirits, and warn'd all,</HI> more particularly <HI>young Per&s;ons, to beware of the like.</HI></P>
<P>On the Day of her Execution, &s;he heard the foregoing Sermon &s;eemingly with a great deal of Attention. She walk'd from the Pri&s;on, to the Place of Execution, which was not much le&s;s than a Mile; being accompanied by the Mini|&s;ters of the Congregational Churches in the Town, and &s;ome other of the neighbouring Mi|ni&s;ters. She all the Way <HI>di&s;cover'd an uncommon Compo&s;ure of Mind, and gave very pertinent An&s;wers to the Que&s;tions</HI> that were put to her.</P>
<P>After &s;he came to the Place of Execution, a Writing, (that was put into one of the Mini&s;ters Hands by the Way, &s;aid to be of her dictating, and which &s;he acknowledg'd to be &s;o) was pub|lickly read at her De&s;ire; wherein &s;he <HI>mentions &s;everal Things that were Matter of Grief and Bitter|ne&s;s to her,</HI> as, That &s;he had <HI>been &s;o forgetful of GOD in her Childhood and Youth, and pa&s;s'd away her early Days in light and wicked Company: To which &s;he a&s;cribes it, that her riper Years had been a Cour&s;e of more direct Rebellion again&s;t</HI> GOD: And &s;he de|&s;ires,

that <HI>Parents, as well as Children, would receive In&s;truction</HI> from.</P>
<P>She here al&s;o laments, that <HI>&s;he had made no bet|ter an U&s;e of</HI> GOD<HI>'s Sabbaths and of her Opportuni|ties of hearing the Word:</HI> She declares, that, when &s;he went to hear the Word, &s;he was <HI>not govern'd by right Motives, and gave little, or no Heed to it:</HI> That, tho' it was &s;ometimes very acceptable, and &s;eem'd <HI>as the lovely Song, of one that had a plea&s;ant Voice,</HI> &amp;c. yet <HI>it made no deep and la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion upon her Mind</HI>: Accordingly &s;he <HI>advi&s;es young People to keep their Hearts and Eyes from wandring</HI> in the Hou&s;e of GOD, and clo&s;ely to attend to that which is their proper Bu&s;ine&s;s there: She al&s;o <HI>mourns, that &s;he had improv'd no more by the Op|portunities &s;he had had in &s;ome Families in which &s;he had liv'd, or been conver&s;ant,</HI> for &s;ome little Time after &s;he was grown up; where the Wor&s;hip of GOD was upheld, and where &s;he had receiv'd many good and whole&s;ome In&s;tructions. And &s;he men|tions it with Regret, that, when &s;he enter'd into the Marriage State, <HI>it was not with one that took Care to maintain the Exerci&s;e of Family Religion,</HI> and advi&s;es all when they marry, to make it their great Care <HI>to marry in the</HI> LORD: She at the &s;ame Time, expre&s;&s;es her <HI>Thankfulne&s;s to the Mini&s;ters</HI>&punc; that had vi&s;ited her, <HI>and that,</HI> as &s;he expre&s;s'd it, <HI>had &s;o often carried her to the Throne of Grace,</HI> particular|ly to the two who had been mo&s;t frequent in their Vi&s;its: And, declaring her <HI>Forgivene&s;s of all the World,</HI> &s;he &s;ignifies <HI>her own Hope,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding her great and manifold Sins, <HI>of obtaining Forgivene&s;s and finding Mercy with GOD thro' the Blood of JESUS CHRIST his Son.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="004599_0035_100DAA31A9323808">The other of the Per&s;ons executed, viz. <HI>Pene|lope Kenny,</HI> a Servant Maid of about 20 Years of Age, was born in or near <HI>Limerick</HI> in the King|dom of <HI>Ireland:</HI> She was bro't up in the <HI>Romi&s;h Religion,</HI> and, as might be rea&s;onably expected in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, &s;tood in need of being <HI>taught the fir&s;t Principles of the Oracles of</HI> GOD. She was indeed very willing to be inform'd, and diligently heark|en'd to &s;uch as would take the Pains to in&s;truct her: She attended upon the <HI>Lord's-Days,</HI> at an Epi&s;copalian A&s;&s;embly, that being the only Way of publick Wor&s;hip at which &s;he had ever been pre&s;ent; except it be that in which &s;he was edu|cated. But &s;he was privately vi&s;ited and a&s;&s;i&s;ted not only by the Mini&s;ter of that Society, but the Mini&s;ters of the other Churches: And from the Pains that had been taken to make her duly <HI>&s;en|&s;ible of her mi&s;erable and peri&s;hing E&s;tate by Rea&s;on of Sin, and of the Way to obtain Salvation by JESUS CHRIST</HI>; &s;he &s;eem'd at length to have &s;ome &s;ui|table Apprehen&s;ions of them, and expre&s;s'd her <HI>Repentance for her other Sins, as well as that for which &s;he was condemn'd.</HI> She heard a Sermon at Church the Morning before her Execution. She walk'd to the Place accompanied by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> who read Prayers for her there. She was greatly <HI>affected with her Ca&s;e</HI>: And, having &s;poken a few Words by Way of <HI>Warning to others,</HI> and the Rev.

<P>As there was an uncommon Number of Spec|tators pre&s;ent upon the mournful Occa&s;ion, &s;o an <HI>uncommon Concern</HI> was vi&s;ible in them all: And

would to GOD, that the Impre&s;&s;ions made upon them may abide, and have an happy Effect; that not only &s;uch as &s;aw, but that all &s;uch as hear, may fear: That tho&s;e, who are in their younger Years would flee youthful Lu&s;ts: That all would be careful to &s;hun the Sin, which has been the Occa&s;ion of bringing the&s;e Per&s;ons to this un|timely End, and avoid every other evil Work: This is what GOD in his Providence calls you to: <HI>Hear then the Conclu&s;ion of the whole Matter: Fear</HI> GOD, <HI>and keep his Commandments: For this is the whole of Man: For</HI> GOD <HI>&s;hall bring every Work into Judgment, with every &s;ecret Thing&punc; whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</HI></P>
