<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE en&s;uing epi&s;tolary poems contain a de&s;cription rather of pa&s;&s;ions than of incidents. They re&s;ulted from an idea of it being po&s;&s;ible to unite the impa&s;&s;ion'd fondne&s;s of <HI>POPE'S</HI> ELOISA, with the cha&s;ter tenderne&s;s of <HI>PRIOR'S</HI> EMMA; avoiding the voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of the fir&s;t, and the too conceding &s;oftne&s;s of the &s;econd. It is hoped the Reader will di&s;tingui&s;h between the apprehended po&s;&s;ibility of exhibit|ing in ver&s;e a more faultle&s;s female Character than the EL|OISA of <HI>POPE,</HI> or the EMMA of <HI>PRIOR,</HI> and the ra&s;h and vain de&s;ign of equalling, much le&s;s of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the tran&s;cend|ent poetic excellence of either of tho&s;e Compo&s;itions.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> LOUISA of the following pages has all that enthu&s;ia&s;m which &s;prings from an heart warmly affectionate, joined to a glowing and picture&s;que imagination. Her &s;en&s;ibilities, heightened, and refined in the bo&s;om of Retirement, know no bounds, except tho&s;e which the dignity of con&s;cious Worth, and a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of Religion pre&s;cribe. It is feared the mo|dern young Ladies will have little &s;ympathy with her, &s;ince &s;he is unfa&s;hionably enthu&s;ia&s;tic, and unfa&s;hionably tender.</P>
<P><HI>AN</HI> ingenious Friend, after reading the fir&s;t epi&s;tle, re|marked, that LOUISA might have de&s;cribed with more inter|e&s;ting particularity her Lover's declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion, and the manner in which &s;he received that declaration; but the Author thought the pre&s;ent method of conveying that circum|&s;tance to the mind of the Reader more poetic. <HI>POPE'S</HI> ELO|ISA is minute in her de&s;cription of the awful Scenery, for|med by the rocks, the &s;treams, and mountains, of Para|clete,
<PB REF="022137_0004_0FB6CB460BA28BD0">
but by no means minute concerning the amorous eclair|ci&s;&s;ement between her&s;elf and Abelard. LOUISA di&s;crimi|nates her Lover's early attentions to her, tho' &s;he leaves the manner of his declaring their &s;ource very much to the Imagi|nation. Her application of the beautiful &s;cenic objects, by which &s;he was at that interval &s;urrounded, to her own, and to her Lover's &s;ituation; and the po&s;&s;ing &s;ud|denly to their pre&s;ent altered appearance, contra&s;ts the charms, and bloom of the fir&s;t, with the chill drearne&s;s of the &s;econd. There it was that the Author had in view that &s;triking letter in the 3d Vol. of the Nouvelle-Heloi&s;e, which de&s;cribes St. Preaux accompanying Mrs. Wolmar to the rocks of Meillerie, then covered with the richne&s;s of Summer-luxuriance; and painting to her the &s;ituation of that very Scene, when he had vi&s;ited it alone, amid&s;t the horrors of Winter, and found tho&s;e horrors congenial to the temper of his Soul.</P>
<P><HI>THIS</HI> Poem has little chance to be popular. A feeling Heart, and a fondne&s;s for Ver&s;e mu&s;t <HI>unite</HI> to render it inter|e&s;ting. A feeling Heart without a glowing Imagination will be tired of the Land&s;cape-painting, &s;omewhat luxuriantly in|ter&s;per&s;ed. An Imagination that glows, while the Heart is frozen, has a propen&s;ity to fancy every thing pro&s;aic which is not imagery, and will probably yawn over the rea&s;oning of the&s;e Lovers, and &s;icken over their tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>IF,</HI> however, this little Work has the honor to intere&s;t and plea&s;e the Few, in whom the kind and &s;weet affections are
<PB REF="022137_0005_0FB6CB479B559AB8">
blended with poetic ta&s;te, the end for which it is publi&s;hed will be obtained.</P>
<P><HI>EXCEPT</HI> &s;ome &s;light alterations, which have been made &s;ince the two fir&s;t Editions, the hundred and fifty &s;ix lines, with which the poem opens, were written when the Author was only nineteen. They had been mi&s;laid during a long in|terval, It is &s;ixteen months &s;ince they were accidentally recovered. Some few Friends, to whom the Fragment was &s;hewn, thought it worth being extended into a regular Work The fir&s;t, and third of the&s;e epi&s;tles are de&s;igned to be de&s;crip|tive, and &s;entimental; the &s;econd, and la&s;t, dramatic.</P>

<L>THEE, EMMA, four &s;low-circling years have &s;een</L>

<L>Seen thee, with fond Affection's moi&s;ten'd gaze,</L>

<L>The tardy Breeze that fans th' unfreighted Tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, as with filial care thy light &s;tep roves,</L>
<L>Thro' India's palmy plains, and &s;picy groves,</L>
<L>To ble&s;s thee, exil'd thus in Youth's gay prime,</L>
<L>May &s;prightly Health re&s;i&s;t the torrid clime,</L>
<L>Temper the &s;ickly bla&s;t, the &s;ever'd ray,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="022137_0007_0FB6CB534AF3AE30">And Peace, and Plea&s;ure, lead the &s;hining Day!</L>

<L>The &s;ighs, and tears, that tendere&s;t pity &s;peak,</L>
<L>Shall &s;well thy brea&s;t, and chill thy glowing cheek;</L>
<L>Since one have been our plea&s;ures, one our cares,</L>
<L>From the fir&s;t dawn of tho&s;e delicious years,</L>
<L>What time, in&s;pir'd by joy's enlivening powers,</L>
<L>We chas'd the gilded infect thro' the bowers,</L>
<L>And oh! I fondly tell my anxious heart,</L>
<L>The deare&s;t truth experience can impart,</L>
<L>That yet, to quench this &s;ympathy of &s;oul,</L>
<L>Time, and the world of waters, vainly roll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er this deep Glen, departing Autumn throws,</L>
<L>With kind reverted glance, a &s;hort repo&s;e,</L>

<L>The thorny pre&s;&s;ure of tyrannic woes;</L>
<L>And where th' incumbant Rock, with awful face,</L>
<L>Bends o'er the fountain, gurgling from its ba&s;e,</L>
<L>And marks the limit of the &s;ilent Dell,</L>
<L>Sadly I &s;it my bo&s;om'd griefs to tell;</L>

<L>By weak, involuntary impul&s;e brought,</L>
<L>Where Love and Memory bear re&s;i&s;tle&s;s &s;way,</L>
<L>And all the weakne&s;s of the Soul betray!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Ye known objects!&mdash;how ye &s;trike my heart!</L>

<L>Or &s;adly linger by the fountain's &s;ide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear, awful witne&s;s of a broken vow,</L>
<L>Steep Rock, how &s;ternly frowns thy rugged brow!</L>
<L>But, if the frequent bla&s;t &s;hall bend thy pines,</L>
<L>Clear at thy foot the cry&s;tal water &s;hines!</L>
<L>Tho' drizzling Clouds the mi&s;ty Mountains veil,</L>
<L>Yet the mild Sun-beam gilds the narrow Dale!</L>
<L>Tho' vernal flow'rs this bank no more adorn,</L>
<L>Nor Summer's wild ro&s;e blu&s;hes on its thorn,</L>

<L>The heedle&s;s roving &s;tep to quiet pau&s;e.</L>

<L>Thus the pale Year, tho' Nature's edicts urge</L>
<L>Her &s;tep to Winter's de&s;olating verge,</L>
<L>Sedately pa&s;&s;es to the drear domain,</L>
<L>And breathes, e'en yet, &s;oft comforts o'er the plain;</L>

<P><HI>NOTE,</HI> UPON reading this third Epi&s;tle to a Friend, he ob&s;erved, that perhaps a compari&s;on of <HI>LOUISA's</HI> own &s;ituation with the harder fate of her Lover, and her tender pity for the inevitable mi&s;eries of &s;uch a union, might have been acceptable in the place of the epi&s;ode of <HI>CLAIRMONT,</HI>

and the de&s;cription of the bower; but it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that <HI>LOUISA</HI> wrote under the immediate impre&s;&s;ion of her extacy to find <HI>EUGENIO</HI> guiltle&s;s; that her Mind was not &s;ober'd enough for reflection. To have inve&s;tigated the un|happy lot of her Lover mu&s;t have been a melancholly em|ployment. Ea&s;ed of an oppre&s;&s;ive weight of mi&s;ery, her exhilarated &s;pirits admit not, &s;o early, any painful ideas. She does not di&s;criminate, &s;he felicitates her de&s;tiny. Her &s;ympathy in the fate of her Friends grows more lively&mdash;&s;he recollects the &s;ituation of <HI>CLAIRMONT</HI>&mdash;Joy is naturally loquacious, and &s;he is gratified in relating his &s;tory to her <HI>EMMA.</HI> She awakens with new vivacity to the impre&s;&s;ions of plea&s;ure, which her Mind was accu&s;tomed to receive from &s;cenic objects. The propen&s;ity to dwell on them prevailed even in the hours of her unhappine&s;s. It is an habit which compares and a&s;&s;imilates the &s;miling, or the gloomy views of Nature to the internal feelings, and is common to people of a lively imagination. In the exultation of her Heart to find her Lover yet e&s;timable, <HI>LOUISA</HI> &s;peeds to the bower, &s;o im|pre&s;&s;'d with his image. Its beauties &s;trike her more for|cibly than ever, and in this frame of Mind &s;he naturally feels delight in painting them.</P>

<L>SAY, mighty Love, and teach my Song,</L>
