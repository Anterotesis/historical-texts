<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following work is written with a de&s;ire of placing, in a <HI>practical</HI> light, &s;ome of the prominent ab&s;urdities of many &s;elf-important reformers of mankind, who, hav|ing heated their imaginations, &s;it down to write <HI>political romances,</HI> which never were, and never will be practical; but which, coming into the hands of per&s;ons as little acquainted with human nature, the hi&s;tory of mankind, and the proofs of religious au|thenticity, as them&s;elves, hurry away the mind from common life into dreams of i|deal felicity; or, by breaking every moral tie (while they declaim about morals) turn loo&s;e their di&s;ciples upon the world, to root up and overthrow every thing which has received the &s;anction of ages, and been held &s;acred by men of real genius and erudition.</P>
<P>Nothing is more ea&s;y, if we leave human nature and <HI>common-place</HI> rea&s;on out of the que&s;tion, than to write a &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;pru|dence, a perfect republic, a body of poli|tical ju&s;tice, or a catalogue of rights: but a clo&s;e attention to any of the&s;e works will readily bring forward glaring and palpable

contradictions. What are the various cla&s;&s;es of mankind to think, when the&s;e men not only <HI>contradict them&s;elves,</HI> but every one has a &s;y&s;tem widely oppo&s;ite to the other, agree|ing only that every regular order and in|&s;titution, religious, moral, and political, is worn out in this age of rea&s;on, and mu&s;t be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>It may be right to appri&s;e the reader, that the words <HI>political ju&s;tice,</HI> are &s;carce ever introduced, except when the &s;ent|iment is taken from Mr. Godwin's Polit|ical Ju&s;tice, 4to. edition.</P>
<P>No doubt tho&s;e who feel them&s;elves <HI>&s;ore,</HI> will endeavour to ca&s;t upon the work the charge of exaggeration; but, on this &s;ubject it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to exaggerate; &s;o inimical are the doctrines of Godwin, Hume, Rou&s;|&s;eau, &amp;c. to all civil &s;ociety, that, when the reader candidly reflects, he will per|ceive that the inferences I have drawn from <HI>their</HI> texts naturally re&s;ult.</P>
<P>Can we wonder at the prevalence of adultery, when doctrines &s;uch as the&s;e men hold out in <HI>fa&s;cinating language,</HI> are toler|ated? Can we wonder at the vices and crimes of a neighbouring people? Or, can we wonder, that the generality of <HI>&s;hallow</HI>-thinking men embrace and &s;upport them with ardour?</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been &s;ugge&s;ted to me to print a <HI>cheap</HI> edition, which might be within the purcha&s;e of <HI>all ranks,</HI> and tend to open the eyes of many deluded followers of the <HI>new</HI> Philo&s;ophers. But though this work was written from the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of warning the world of the intentions and tendency of jacobinical principles, there are <HI>two</HI> rea&s;ons for my objecting to this advice:&mdash;Fir&s;t, as Mr. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ayfair &s;ays, in his excellent Hi&s;tory of Jacobini&s;m, "He who <HI>pleaded</HI> the cau&s;e of murder and plunder, <HI>&s;aw his</HI> work di&s;tributed by thou&s;ands and hundreds of thou&s;ands, and him&s;elf en|riched; while he, who endeavoured to &s;upport the cau&s;e of law, of order, and of the proprietor, had his book&s;eller to pay, and &s;aw his labours converted into wa&s;te paper. It is true he had the con&s;olation of his own mind, and the e&s;teem of the few to whom his intentions were known; but with regard to effect upon the public mind, it produced none: his main object was therefore unattained, and the revolu|tionary
<PB N="ix" REF="038973_0008_10128253CACEFBA8">
argument remained triumphant. With energy, &s;ome money, and a di&s;po|&s;ition to make u&s;e of it on one &s;ide; and on the other, indolence, with pecuniary means in abundance, but not the <HI>will</HI> to employ one &s;hilling of it; can we be &s;ur|pri&s;ed that things went in favour of tho&s;e who had the energy and the will? It would have been &s;urpri&s;ing if it had not; and accordingly we have &s;een the &s;hirtle&s;s, &s;hoele&s;s <HI>Vagabond,</HI> burning the ca&s;tles and title-deeds of the proprietor, and with an high hand put them&s;elves in the place. Let the rich a&s;k, Which &s;ide will have mo&s;t writers, tho&s;e who pay, or tho&s;e who do not?" Secondly, through the medium of circulating Libraries, any man may read the work for muchle&s;s, than though it were printed on paper like the Rights of Man.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, however, I can|not &s;peak from what I have experienced, and it gives me con&s;iderable hopes that the de&s;tructive torpor of the rich is evap|orating, and that they begin to take an active intere&s;t in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is: I have only to ob&s;erve, that Two Editions have been &s;old in le&s;s than &s;ix months.</P>
<P>Mr. Playfair, when he is &s;peaking of the diffidence, and di&s;tru&s;t, and jealou&s;y, and indifference of the different nations, &s;ays: "But if they will not prepare &s;eriou&s;ly to
<PB N="x" REF="038973_0009_1012825C074144F0">
re&s;i&s;t, they mu&s;t prepare to &s;uffer; for France will give law to Europe if &s;he once gets the better, and then adieu to tho&s;e Principalities and Powers who have quar|relled about u&s;ele&s;s etiquette, when they &s;hould have rivalled each other in MANLY COURAGE; and who will continue in all likelihood to di&s;pute about their rights and privileges, till there remain none for them to di&s;pute about."</P>
<P>It is here that the conduct and charac|ter of Great-Britain <HI>de&s;erves well</HI> of man|kind. But for the energy of this nation, Europe would, ere this, have been &s;queez|ed to pieces with the <HI>Gallic hug</HI>: and this country would have &s;welled its bloated pride. But the VOLUNTEERS have &s;aved the nation. They have told France, that before &s;he can <HI>plunder and burn London, that &s;elfi&s;h and &s;hopkeeping city,</HI> according to the threat of Barrere, &s;he mu&s;t float in the air, and march through a fore&s;t of pikes and bayonets. They have told the French Propagande that we are not to be cajoled with flatteries and lies to believe a people, who conquer more by the&s;e means than by the &s;word; and they have told the idle and rebellious, that they cannot hope for &s;uc|ce&s;s. While we remain firm to our&s;elves, we may &s;uffer much, but cannot be brought under the yoke of France.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. The Meeting of two Republican Philo&s;ophers.</HEAD>
<P>ONE fine &s;ummer evening, Doctor Alogos walk|ed out to the banks of Wynander Meer, to enjoy the beautiful &s;cenery &s;urrounding, and reflected in the mirror of the cry&s;tal lake.</P>
<P>'This is charming,' &s;aid he to him&s;elf, as he walked onward; 'the harmony of nature is vi&s;ible in every object round me; the clouds form a maje&s;|tic and ever-varying canopy; man alone deviates from that pure &s;tate of exi&s;tence he knew in the golden age; man alone is unhappy; his pa&s;&s;ions and his appetites in &s;ociety know no bounds &s;hort of attainment; and why? becau&s;e he will not copy the example of unerring nature in her conduct of animals. The&s;e never deviate into rapine and out|rage &mdash;they live free, and are happy.'</P>
<P>At that moment he heard a noi&s;e in the air, and looking round, di&s;tingui&s;hed a hawk in full pur|&s;uit after a lapwing. The harmle&s;s creature flat|tered, and appeared nearly exhau&s;ted, while the
<PB N="2" REF="038973_0013_1012826A750D0248">
bird of prey redoubled his exertions&mdash;Doctor Alo|gos, who u&s;ually walked with a fowling-piece for his amu&s;ement, brought the hawk down at a &s;hot; and the lapwing, as if to thank him, &s;ettled near upon the ground. In a little time it recovered from its fright, and a fine worm creeping before it fell a prey to <HI>in&s;tinct.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor mu&s;ed on this &s;ubject as he contin|ued his walk.&mdash;'At wor&s;t,' &s;aid he, 'this is only a partial evil, and does not interrupt the har|mony of the univer&s;e; it is only matter changing form, and making room in the great field of nature for new exi&s;tences; if we had no hawks, in twenty years the whole &s;urface of the earth would be co|vered with lapwings; and if we had no lapwings, the whole globe would be &s;o over-run with worms, that, like a Che&s;hire chee&s;e filled with mites, the cru&s;ting would crumble away. It is nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;tronger animals &s;hould prey upon the weaker, and quite in the order of things: but for men to mur|der each other, is very different, and ari&s;es from an unju&s;t accumulation of property. Oh happy times when <HI>property</HI> was unregarded, when no tyrant could plant his foot upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an acre of ground, and repul&s;e his fellow from the &s;od! Property! Proper|ty! thou art the bane of earthly good, an ulcer in &s;ociety, and a cancer in the political oeconomy.'</P>
<P>As the Doctor &s;tamped his foot on the ground in the attitude of an orator, heated with the idea of revolution and equality, a young man in a very rag|ged dre&s;s leaped from a thicket of hazels, and holding a pi&s;tol to the Doctor's brea&s;t, demanded his money.</P>
<P>The Doctor's piece was unloaded, or his benev|olence for the human &s;pecies might have been lo&s;t in the agitation of &s;urpri&s;e; but making a full p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e, and gazing at his antagoni&s;t, 'This,' &s;aid
<PB N="3" REF="038973_0014_1012826F41A6FD28">
he, 'is not right in the nature of things; force tells me that your argument is wrong; you &s;hould have fir&s;t convinced me of your wants, and then my pur&s;e would have been your ju&s;t property.'</P>
<P>'All property is a monopoly,' cried the young metaphy&s;ician, 'and the mo&s;t laconic arguments are be&s;t: the&s;e rags which I wear are &s;ufficient vouch|ers for my wants; and unle&s;s you can prove that &s;ome other has a greater claim to your property, I mu&s;t have the contents of your pocket.'</P>
<P>'You are a philo&s;opher,' &s;aid the Doctor.</P>
<P>'Yes,' replied the youth; 'my dear Stupeo u&s;ed to tell me &s;o; but philo&s;ophy is not rewarded in the pre&s;ent dete&s;table &s;y&s;tem of things; virtue is ridi|culed, and vice rides in gilded coaches.'</P>
<P>'How much do you need?' &s;aid the Doctor, in tran&s;port. 'You are a pupil of the <HI>new &s;chool;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me along with me, and you &s;hall find me a man who will e&s;teem you exactly according to the quan|tity of merit you po&s;&s;e&s;s; your talents ought not to be thus lo&s;t.'</P>
<P>'Stupeo was perfectly right,' &s;aid the youth, 'he told me that all men are equal: I will go with you.'</P>
<P>'Who is this Stupeo?' inquired the Doctor, while the young man walked by his &s;ide. 'He was a very great philo&s;opher, a mythologi&s;t, a met|aphy&s;ician, and a &s;cholar: he was my tutor at college.'</P>
<P>'You a collegian!' cried the Doctor, in &s;ur|pri&s;e: 'how came you in this mi&s;erable condition, and how could you commit &s;uch an act of danger+ous outrage?' 'From the mo&s;t natural rea&s;on in the world: all crime, my dear &s;ir, ari&s;es from &s;ome po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what others want; but in fact, there is no &s;uch thing as crime; it is a mere chimera, ex|i&s;ting only in the law, like John Doe and Richard Roe.'</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="038973_0015_10128270D863BA88">'There &s;urely are crimes,' interrupted the Doc|tor, 'crimes again&s;t political ju&s;tice, and the liber|ty of the individual: as for in&s;tance, I have, as a willing animal, a right or power to take a walk; but if I am to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated every time I go out, my liberty is re&s;trained, my hou&s;e becomes a pri&s;on, and I might as well be in a dungeon. I think crimes of this nature ought to be puni&s;hed.'</P>
<P>'How? By coercion or re&s;traint?&mdash;My dear Stupeo u&s;ed to &s;ay that puni&s;hment is a &s;pecious name, but is in reality nothing more than force, put upon one being by another who happens to be &s;tronger. How can truth be promoted by this? If I am hanged for what is called a robbery, how am I convinced of my error? And it is the reform of the individual you &s;hould &s;eek, and not the pun|i&s;hment of an action partial in its nature.'</P>
<P>'You are wrong,' &s;aid the Doctor; the offend|er ought to be re&s;trained as long as the &s;afety of the community pre&s;cribes it, for this is ju&s;t: re|&s;train him not an in&s;tant from a &s;imple view to his own improvement, for this is contrary to rea&s;on and morality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 132 and 161 of Political Ju&s;tice, where the two la&s;t contradictory ab&s;urdities will be found verbatim.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'But my dear &s;ir,' cried the youth, warmly, 'Stupeo, who was a philo&s;opher and a metaphy&s;i|cian, &s;ays&mdash;'</P>
<P>'Says a fiddle&s;tick,' retorted the Doctor, 'it is the good of the whole we are to &s;eek; what &s;igni|fies individuals? they are as mites in the univer&s;e. Truth, truth mu&s;t be propagated, and I glory to &s;ee we are making &s;uch rapid progre&s;s.'</P>
<P>They were by this time arrived at the gate of a neat-looking man&s;ion, with high chimnies, and heavy cornices, which declared it to have been erected in the time of William the Third, a flower
<PB N="5" REF="038973_0016_1012827276EB76A8">
garden &s;pread before it, in which a beautiful young woman was gathering flowers. She appeared a|bout eighteen, with all the innocence of that period, and the beauty attending upon health and good nature.</P>
<P>'Your daughter, I &s;uppo&s;e?' &s;aid the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>'No,' replied the Doctor; 'do you think I would belie my principles by uniting my&s;elf for life to any object, when the human mind is of &s;o changeable a nature? She is my neice; her parents, who were very poor, and very ignorant, are dead. I attempted to educate her on my plan; but &s;he is of a perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he will not exert the di|vine privilege of re&s;i&s;tance, and throw off the &s;hackles of domination: &s;he per&s;i&s;ts that the very difference of &s;exes &s;hould teach us that they are de&s;igned for different pur&s;uits.'</P>
<P>'Laura,' cried the Doctor, 'have you &s;et my room in order? I have brought home a &s;tranger.'</P>
<P>'No,' replied Laura, blu&s;hing; 'I was obliged to vi&s;it a poor old woman in the village; and I in|tended, as &s;oon as I had gathered &s;ome flowers, to arrange your apartment.'</P>
<P>'The d&mdash;l take all the old women in the uni|ver&s;e,' cried the Doctor, in a pa&s;&s;ion, 'with their di&s;ea&s;es and their wants! What had you to do, you idle &s;lut, with gathering flowers, when all my room is covered with litter?

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. The progre&s;s of Truth and Philo&s;ophy in an ignorant mind.</HEAD>
<P>MY name is Frederic Fenton. I might per|haps be a&s;hamed to mention my family, when you &s;ee me in the&s;e mi&s;erable garments; but truth mu&s;t be &s;poken without regard to tho&s;e fal&s;e prejudices, which call folly by the name of honor.</P>
<P>My parents have great landed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that is, are great tyrants, in the county of Kent. They educated me in all the &s;uper&s;titions of the Prote&s;|tant

church, and my whole &s;tudy was to conform to their de&s;ires, and re&s;train my wi&s;hes to the line of what they called rectitude and religion.</P>
<P>I was &s;o gro&s;sly ignorant, as to believe that di&s;|obeying them was di&s;plea&s;ing to the Almighty; and I con&s;idered religion as a &s;ure means of leading me to a better world, and making me hereafter hap|py: but the&s;e were the dreams of unenlightened im|agination, impre&s;&s;ed upon me by education.</P>
<P>Learning appeared in my eyes the greate&s;t object of human attainment; and my parents delighting in my progre&s;s, my whole powers were bent to the acquirement of what they called valuable know|ledge.</P>
<P>I did not then know that profound ignorance is the real and only &s;tate in which men can enjoy fe|licity; and that every advance from this is &s;o far di|verging from the intention of nature.</P>
<P>I was never ea&s;y under the neglect of a duty, becau&s;e I either feared the cen&s;ure of my parents, or the vengeance of an offended deity: and I re|frained for the&s;e rea&s;ons from committing any of tho&s;e actions, fal&s;e morality particularly con&s;iders atrocious. So eager was my application to &s;tudy, and &s;o tenacious my memory, that at fifteen I was judged capable of commencing &s;tudent in form.</P>
<P>I took leave of my parents with tears; and my bo&s;om &s;eemed to lo&s;e its tranquility at parting with a youth nearly my own age, and who had been my friend and companion from infancy. Vernon was not le&s;s affected; and we vowed eternal amity at our &s;eparation.</P>
<P>At the recommendation of a nobleman, the di|vine Stupeo became my preceptor. He was a per|&s;on of mean birth; but that di&s;tinction I de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;eeing in him only a man of talents.</P>
<P>He began his plan of education, with &s;tarting
<PB N="9" REF="038973_0020_101282820BF1B958">
bold truths, which &s;hocked and dazzled me with their lu&s;tre, without confounding my perceptions. 'I will not,' &s;aid he, 'overwhelm you at once with the whole blaze of knowledge, though I would as little wi&s;h to lead you &s;tep by &s;tep, as though I would &s;urpri&s;e you to an acquie&s;cence with truth: immortal truth can never lo&s;e by being &s;een; it bears down every barrier; it is a mighty torrent; it may be &s;tayed for a while, but the acceleration of its rapidity will increa&s;e in equal ratio.'</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I ventured to ob&s;erve, that the human mind is too often led into error by a deception of the &s;en&s;es, which are ever ready to adopt any new object, however ab&s;urd. His eloquence, which was like the torrent he de&s;cribed, &s;oon overcame my weak objections, and the fir&s;t gleam of truth and philo&s;ophy dawned upon my &s;oul.</P>
<P>He lamented the profound obedience I paid to my parents. 'My dear pupil,' &s;aid he, 'what is this bondage you call duty? And what right have tho&s;e beings you call father and mother to direct your actions, and controul the inborn vigour of your &s;oul?'</P>
<P>'By the claim of nature; by the trouble they have taken for my pre&s;ervation; and by the love they bear me in particular,' &s;aid I.</P>
<P>'Unju&s;t in extreme!' cried he. 'Do your par|ents love you for your real value?&mdash;No! it is ari&s;tocracy, &s;elf-love, and family pride, that teach them to &s;et a value on you.

<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing with what conviction truth fla&s;hes upon the mind:&mdash;Stupeo's axioms were unrefuta+ble, and I found the &s;uperiority of plea&s;ure over all the laborious and mu&s;ty re&s;earches of learning, which never &s;atisfy a doubting philo&s;ophic mind.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I ran into a few eccentricities, &s;uch as breaking the leg of a waiter in a drunken frolic&mdash; getting a fever by a &s;urfeit&mdash;and &s;pending my &s;a|lary before it became due; but the&s;e are the nec|e&s;&s;ary attendants on this mi&s;erable &s;y&s;tem of things.

What power had any generation of men to fell their po&s;terity (no matter who bought them)? When had I <HI>given my con&s;ent</HI> to the government I lived under?

<P>'Did the Tyrians, the Grecians, the Romans, the Carthaginians never go to war?' &s;aid I.

<P>'Then man becomes a mere machine?' &s;aid I.</P>
<P>'Man a machine!' &s;aid he, with ardour: 'man is a &s;ublime animal; the great lord of creation&punc; it is true his &s;oul is nothing but an heap or collec|tion of different perceptions, or objects, united together by <HI>certain relations,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ed, though fal&s;ely, to be endowed with perfect &s;implicity and identity.

<P>Stupeo pau&s;ed a moment, but he never wanted re&s;ources in the exten&s;ive &s;tores of his mind.

<P>I could not but ob&s;erve, that he had evaded my que&s;tions; but that was an effort of his exqui&s;ite wit and talent for di&s;putation.

<P>I endeavoured to <HI>&s;pread the truth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A cant phra&s;e of all Reformers.</NOTE> with all my powers; but the old fellows thinking their places in danger, and alarmed at the thunders of rea&s;on, and the fulminations of &s;cience, expelled me the col|lege, and I returned to my father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There I re&s;olved to live as much as po&s;&s;ible in conformity to rea&s;on, without &s;tooping to the forms of cu&s;tom.

<P>My mother, who was a weak, &s;illy old woman, was always crying at my whims (as my father called them); and if I had not &s;teeled my heart again&s;t that fooli&s;h failing, <HI>pity,</HI> I could not have per&s;i&s;ted in the line of truth.</P>
<P><HI>Vernon,</HI> the friend of my youth, re&s;ided at this time at our hou&s;e, having fini&s;hed the &s;tudies nece&s;|&s;ary to a mercantile education; and he now only waited for a vacancy, to go abroad on &s;ome adven|ture.</P>
<P>I endeavoured in vain to open the eyes of this bigoted youth, who was nearly my own age. I put into his hands books of religious controver&s;y, in hopes of catching his mind by &s;ome in&s;oluble que&s;tion. I demanded of him frequently an expla|nation
<PB N="23" REF="038973_0034_101282B11736E6D0">
of all the articles of religious belief. I read to him the admirable writings of Voltaire and Hume: but he had the impudence to &s;ay, they contradicted each other; that Voltaire frequently a&s;&s;erted fal&s;ehoods as certainties, which three fourths of his readers had not means to detect; and that Hume was &s;o contradictory and unintelli|gible, that the reader was lo&s;t in a jargon of words.</P>
<P>He had taken a &s;trong fancy to a very elegant girl, the daughter of a farmer in our neighbourhood, and was never happy but when writing ver&s;es in her prai&s;e, or teaching her what he called, the Chri&s;tian virtues. He was &s;o jealous of this fan|cied property, that he was for excluding all others from their natural right. Had I attended to the old-fa&s;hioned doctrine of <HI>honour,</HI> I might have re|frained from de&s;iring the girl my&s;elf; but our en|joyments are very tran&s;ient in this world, and none but fools will think of the next.</P>
<P>Your church people, who believe that they have &s;ouls, might indeed be deterred from violating innocence, and plundering the weak: but I rejoice to think the&s;e notions are growing ob&s;olete; and not being troubled with &s;uch qualms my&s;elf, I re|&s;olved to gratify the pure and natural de&s;ire I had, at lea&s;t to divide with Vernon the affections of Amelia.</P>
<P>The girl her&s;elf &s;oon perceived the difference; for, having a quick under&s;tanding, &s;he became en|amoured of the new doctrines I daily di&s;cour&s;ed upon, for they carried &s;elf-evident proofs in the latitude they allowed for the pa&s;&s;ions and weakne&s;s of human nature.</P>
<P>Vernon was of too jealous a di&s;po&s;ition not to perceive her growing coolne&s;s towards him&s;elf, and that all his &s;anctified religious notions were un|attended to. His vigilance was rou&s;ed, and he &s;oon

<P>'Morality,' I replied, 'is political ju&s;tice, which prefers the good of the whole to the good of a part; &s;uffering partial evil, that the great work of truth may go forward, and liberty and rea&s;on be paramount over &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, pride, &s;uper|&s;tition, and prie&s;tcraft.'</P>
<P>'Excellent! cried my father, breaking into a loud laugh: 'a &s;peech worthy the humble copier of Rou&s;&s;eau, and the great metaphy&s;ician Stupeo. Let me a&s;k you one que&s;tion, Frederick&mdash;Do you under&s;tand your&s;elf?'</P>
<P>'Do I under&s;tand my&s;elf? Yes; and what I &s;ay is as legible as the broad beams of the &s;un at noon day: it is written in the great book of Na|ture.'</P>
<P>It was evening when this conver&s;ation took place: and we were &s;tartled by a &s;udden blaze of light, which darted acro&s;s the hemi&s;phere; at the &s;ame moment the &s;ervants cried out, Fire! and we could perceive the farm in a blaze.</P>
<P>My father and I, together with the &s;ervants, ha&s;tened to the &s;pot, where we found a &s;cene of deplorable di&s;tre&s;s. The farmer had forgot his children in his endeavours to &s;ave his property, which he threw out at the window.</P>
<P>His wife had fainted away; and the younger chil|dren were &s;creaming in an upper &s;tory. My father, without any reflection, darted up the flaming &s;tairs, and de&s;cended with the two little boys in his arms; in doing which, he was con&s;iderably &s;corched. Meanwhile, I &s;natched a ladder from one of the
<PB N="32" REF="038973_0043_101282CB33ECD8C0">
men, with intention to re&s;cue Amelia, who had been &s;leeping in her room, and now appeared ter|rified at the window. I was going to apply the ladder, when part of the roof fell into the room where her father was employed, and drove him to the window in danger of &s;uffocation.</P>
<P>In this dilemma it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave both: &mdash;'Were Stupeo here,' cried I, 'he would tell which is the mo&s;t de&s;erving of life; but I &s;hall commit &s;ome inju&s;tice, if I &s;ave the life of the one with the le&s;&s;er merit, ('Let go the ladder,' cried &s;everal; 'why do you keep it u&s;ele&s;s?') I, at that moment, remembered a parallel ca&s;e, quoted by the excellent philo&s;opher, Stupeo, in &s;upport of the new political ju&s;tice.&mdash;'Suppo&s;e,' &s;aid he, 'the Archbi&s;hop of Cambray and his maid are both in danger of peri&s;hing in flames, which ought I to &s;ave? The maid, a &s;tupid creature, little better than a brute;&mdash;the archbi&s;hop, a man of eminent virtue and learning, and the author of Telemachus.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Godwin's Political Ju&s;tice, page 84.</NOTE> To &s;ave the one, at the hazard of my own life, is &s;carce more virtue than to &s;ave a dog; but to &s;ave the Archbi&s;hop, is an act of the highe&s;t virtue; be|cau&s;e all actions are to be e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eemed in exact pro|portion to the merit of the per&s;on receiving the bene|fit. Now the difficulty is, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to know whether the farmer or his daughter is of mo&s;t va|lue to mankind. The farmer cultivates the earth, and provides for his family in a gro&s;s kind of way: the daughter is young, and may add many to the human &s;pecies: but then&mdash;'</P>
<P>I was calmly proceeding, in &s;pite of the &s;trug|gles of the men to wre&s;t the ladder from me, when a tremendous cra&s;h, and a large column of flame, ended my di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and I had the horror to &s;ee the
<PB N="33" REF="038973_0044_101282CE0172E150">
farmer and his daughter both overwhelmed in the burning ruins. I was &s;hocked at &s;o dreadful an accident, which would not have happened had Stupeo been there: but in this pre&s;ent ra&s;cally &s;y&s;|tem of government and &s;ociety, virtue will not al|ways &s;ucceed; and no man can be condemned, if evil &s;hould re&s;ult from a good intention.</P>
<P>It was, however, a very deplorable circum|&s;tance, and I regretted deeply that I was not bet|ter ver&s;ed in the great book of Nature and Man, as I &s;hould then have known in&s;tantly how to ap|preciate the &s;everal degrees of merit.</P>
<P>Another unplea&s;ant circum&s;tance re&s;ulted. The common people, who are like a &s;wini&s;h multitude, and cannot perceive rea&s;on, (how indeed &s;hould they, when they are held in profound ignorance?) in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that I had retained the ladder pur|po&s;ely to &s;uffer them to peri&s;h: by which I expec|ted to avoid the con&s;equences of my connexion with Amelia. My father him&s;elf was inclined to believe the report; and unle&s;s I had the logic of Stupeo, and the effrontery of Voltaire, (who being a&s;ked how he could in&s;ert fal&s;ehoods &s;o glaring in his hi&s;tory, replied, 'To one half of the pre&s;ent generation they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill be facts, and the next will not po&s;&s;e&s;s the mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f detection.') I &s;hould have found it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent their reproaches.</P>
<P>A committee of &s;tupid farmers met to inquire into the cau&s;e of the fire. It began in a back &s;table, where I had been on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in the cour&s;e of the day: their &s;u&s;picions appeared facts, and a war|rant was &s;ent for to apprehend me.</P>
<P>I was very much a&s;toni&s;hed when my father mentioned this with tears in his eyes, and told me the corroborating circum&s;tances were in every point again&s;t me: that my retention of the ladder was
<PB N="34" REF="038973_0045_101282D21FD73308">
too evidently to prevent the re&s;cue of two wretch|ed per&s;ons whom I had in fact murdered: that he &s;huddered at being the father of &s;o profligate a &s;on; but that his con&s;ideration for my mother prevented his a&s;&s;i&s;ting to detain me him&s;elf, as I &s;hould mo&s;t a&s;&s;urdly be hanged, unle&s;s I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed incontrover|tible proofs in my favour.</P>
<P>'I maintain it,' cried I, 'that in a &s;tate of na|ture the fire could not have happened: I even doubt that it has now happened.

<P>'Fly!' cried he: 'the mob is coming acro&s;s the green&mdash;it is dark, ha&s;te through the garden!'</P>
<P>I really did not &s;ee that any good would re&s;ult from my being hanged; for how could I know what yet remained for me to perform on the great &s;tage of life? and accordingly I ha&s;tened from the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I continued to cro&s;s the country, chagrined at the effect of con&s;ideration. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the new philo&s;ophy involves one in &s;ituations that re|quire all the energies of the human mind; and in|deed

it would be almo&s;t impracticable, were it not for that fundamental and happy maxim of di&s;be|lieving every thing pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come.</P>
<P>I dete&s;ted di&s;gui&s;e, becau&s;e it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of truth; and I know not but all &s;orts of &s;tratagem are blots on the dignity of virtue. It was, however, very awkward, that a philo&s;o|pher &s;hould be hanged for &s;uch a trifle as the death of a farmer and his daughter.</P>
<P>I proceeded forward the whole of that night, and the next day I remained to re&s;t at a farm-hou&s;e, again &s;etting out at the commencement of evening. I had not advanced above &s;even miles, when I heard a con&s;iderable noi&s;e in a barn, like a tumult of applau&s;e, which again &s;ub&s;ided into a calm; and I could hear a voice pronouncing a de|clamatory &s;peech. I ha&s;tened to the door, which was guarded by &s;ome ill-looking fellows, and, hav|ing paid &s;ixpence, was u&s;hered into a croud of gaping farmers and cottagers. A little dark com|plexioned man, with a mo&s;t hypocritical counte|nance, and a grin of &s;elf-applau&s;e mingled with contempt, was in&s;tructing the clowns in their rights.

When the latter re|que&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to in&s;titute a company of firemen, the for|mer con&s;ented with the&s;e words: "But it is to be remember|ed, that this &s;ort of &s;ocieties have greatly di&s;turbed the peace of that province in general, and of tho&s;e cities in particular. <HI>Whatever name</HI> we give them, and for <HI>whatever purpo&s;es</HI> they may be founded, they will not fail to form them&s;elves into a&s;|&s;emblies, however &s;hort their meetings may be." So political clubs for whatever purpo&s;e in&s;tituted, will not fall in the end to produce anarchy, and take the reins of government into their own hands.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>I was &s;o agitated with this dialogue between the pretended friends of liberty, that I &s;tarted up, and cried aloud, 'Hypocrites! will you &s;ully the beau|ty of truth by &s;uch actions? Will you bring her into di&s;grace with mankind?'</P>

We have been here more than a week, and the bill will be &s;ome pounds.' So &s;aying, he gently opened the window.

<P>In the morning I found my&s;elf too &s;tiff to re|move with plea&s;ure. The whole inn was in an uproar about the fugitives; and the landlord con|&s;igned all politicians pell mell to the devil.

The fa&s;hiona|ble Hume doubted whether he thought he exi&s;ted; but I went further, I doubted whether I doubted that I thought I did not exi&s;t, and from thence pro|ceeding to e&s;tabli&s;h the axiom, <HI>Cogitas ergo &s;um,</HI> I think therefore I am. I began to think that I did

not think, that I thought at all, when I was awak|ened by the &s;ound of &s;everal voices; and looking up, I perceived coming along the road a man on hor&s;e-back, with &s;everal people &s;urrounding him; one held the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, and the two others, with con&s;ta|bles &s;taves, held him on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>A &s;ight &s;o &s;hockingly &s;hameful to human nature, and the natural freedom of man, arou&s;ed me to at|tempt &s;ome noble exploit. I darted forward, and brandi&s;hed my cudgel&mdash;'What right,' cried I 'have you to impri&s;on your fellow man?

<P>'He is an highwayman, and a murderer,' replied &s;everal, 'and you look like a madman.'</P>
<P>'That is nothing to the purpo&s;e,' cried I, kind|ling into patriotic frenzy, at recollecting &s;ome of the arguments of the great Stupeo, and the maxims of political ju&s;tice. 'The man who profe&s;&s;es him|&s;elf ready to commit murder, &s;eems to be &s;carcely a le&s;s dangerous member of &s;ociety than he, who having already committed murder, has no apparent intention to repeat his offence.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Godwin's Political Ju&s;tice, page 761.</NOTE>&mdash;Unle&s;s this man appeared ready, and in a &s;ituation to repeat his of|fence, political ju&s;tice requires him to be left at his own di&s;cretion.

<P>So &s;aying, I &s;eized the bridle from the man who held it, and the highwayman &s;ticking his &s;purs in the bea&s;t, rode over the con&s;table, and would have gained his liberty, had not a &s;turdy clown levelled a &s;tone at his head, which brought him over his hor&s;e; I was &s;eized by &s;everal at once, and not|with&s;tanding a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, I was dragged like a &s;lave, and forced again&s;t my will into an inn upon the road.</P>
<P>Are the&s;e the laws, the dete&s;table maxims of &s;ociety? cried I. Am I to be confined here as a pri&s;oner of &s;tate, for attempting to re&s;cue an injured man from the tyranny of the law? O that the glo|rious day were come, when every man &s;hall act from the divine impul&s;es of his will, and rea&s;on and liberty be acknowledged as the pre&s;iding deities.</P>
<P>While I was exclaiming to my&s;elf, a con&s;table en|tered, and informed me, that as I was deemed either intoxicated or touched in the head, it had been agreed that on my paying five pounds as a compen|&s;ation to tho&s;e I had wounded, they would not en|ter an action again&s;t me, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould be &s;ent to the country gaol for attempting a re&s;cue.</P>

<P>'There is a return chai&s;e for London at the door,' &s;aid one of the waiters, 'are you going that way?'</P>
<P>'Any way,' &s;aid I! and following him, I entered the chai&s;e, and was driven rapidly towards London.</P>
<P>I always make it a rule to read the great book of Nature, and philo&s;ophi&s;e as I go along the road; and I could not but be delighted to &s;ee the great book bound in green, with variegated edges of trees and flowers. Now, thought I, is this chai&s;e an idea or a reality; I cannot prove it by argument to be real, it is therefore an idea, a whirling idea: now I have a very &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of this whirl|ing idea; I wonder if I was to &s;tep out into what &s;eems an highway to my eyes (but which may be in fact the Red Sea), I &s;hould &s;till continue whirl|ing to London. This was a very metaphy&s;ical problem, which nobody but the fa&s;hionable Hume, the conundrumic Berkely, or the great Stupeo could re&s;olve.</P>
<P>The cries of <HI>No Popery</HI> rou&s;ed my attention, and I perceived we were entering the metropolis. <HI>No Popery</HI> was written upon every hou&s;e, and a parcel of ragged fellows, with <HI>No Popery</HI> chalked upon their hats, &s;topped the chai&s;e, and demanded money&punc;</P>
<P>'For what?' &s;aid I, 'I don't care any thing about Popery; a wi&s;e man will have no religion at all, becau&s;e the prejudices and narrow principles of religious &s;ects will prevent his mind expanding to the broad beams of truth.'</P>
<P>'No gammon! &mdash;Tip us the grub!' cried &s;eve|ral grea&s;y fellows. 'He's a Popery man! a Roman Catholic! and an enemy to the Church!' roared out others, while the words 'Go it! go it!' &s;ound|ed

around me, and a &s;hower of mud and &s;tones nearly overwhelmed me, &s;ma&s;hing the gla&s;s of the chai&s;e, and almo&s;t knocking down the driver.</P>
<P>'You are a &s;et of ra&s;cally cowards,' cried I: 'will any man of you fight me: I will die in the cau&s;e of freedom.'&mdash;A ring! a ring! was &s;houted and formed; and &s;tripping off my coat and hat, I threw them into the chai&s;e, which drove away from the fury of the mob.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething generous in a mob; we there &s;ee the fir&s;t germ of ju&s;tice, genero&s;ity, and mag|nanimity; we &s;ee that a giant of a man &s;hall not be allowed to annihilate a little one. It is true, that the love of novelty often inclines them to promote a quarrel where it might be reconciled: but no man &s;hould be a&s;hamed to box in a ju&s;t cau&s;e, e&s;pe|cially if he remembers the value of the pugili&s;tic &s;cience at Athens and Sparta: and why, becau&s;e I am better dre&s;&s;ed &s;hould I refu&s;e to enter the ring with a dirty antagoni&s;t, whom I may have injured? Whoever has read the novels of a very great dra|mati&s;t, mu&s;t be &s;truck with the beauties of boxing; an art, which I hope will &s;uper&s;ede the u&s;e of pi&s;tols between jealous lovers and injured hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>A champion being found, he came forward with an a&s;pect horridly ferocious. He was a great-boned Iri&s;hman, and all the vile pa&s;&s;ions of human nature were written in his countenance. His &s;avage ap|pearance inclined the mob in my favour, who ut|tered a long roar of applau&s;e when I intrepidly de|termined to &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the conte&s;t.

I now had con&s;iderable advantage, and though I had three teeth jammed into my mouth, I broke one of his ribs, and levelled him with a full blow upon the ground, where he turned black in the face, and was left for dead.</P>
<P>A hackney coach was in&s;tantly pre&s;&s;ed into my &s;ervice, and I was conducted by the mob in triumph to a public hou&s;e, where they drank them&s;elves half drunk in the joy of my having conquered.</P>
<P>Though I had at fir&s;t been in con&s;iderable dan|ger of being murdered, yet my &s;ub&s;equent valour had rendered me dear to them all: &s;o true is it, that pure human nature can di&s;cern truth when it de&s;cends to the level of their own ideas.</P>
<P>I was here cleared of gore, and refre&s;hed with &s;ome cordials. I had lo&s;t my coat and hat, and had not paid the chai&s;e, which I knew not where to find; but the&s;e were mere partial evils. A gene|rous black&s;mith accommodated me with a coat, and a butcher in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould take his red and blue cap for love, for he had never &s;een a better cock in his life&punc; as tough as bull-beef.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. The Vagabond achieves &s;everal noble exploits&mdash;an unexpected meeting in the cells of Newgate&mdash;a &s;light idea of a Revolution.</HEAD>
<P>I DESCENDED among&s;t the mob, and gra&s;ping a pole with blue colours, and the words <HI>No Popery</HI> in&s;cribed upon it&mdash;'Let us go,' cried I, 'my dear boys. No Popery! Lord George Gordon for|ever!' A loud and repeated huzza rent the air, and the prodigious ma&s;s of people pre&s;&s;ed after me to|wards Newgate. I was a&s;toni&s;hed in my&s;elf at the change of my fortune: I had but an hour before been in danger of being &s;toned by the very mob that, under my commands, would have made no &s;cruple of &s;etting London on fire. But &s;uch is al|ways the reward of great talents in moments of popular commotion; it is then great men are brought forward from ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands were already a&s;&s;embled before the augu&s;t depo&s;it of trembling victims: our reinforce|ment was received with the triumphant &s;houting of
<PB N="63" REF="038973_0074_1012832D30B17058">
the patriotic bands, who felt the energy of liberty pul&s;ating in every artery. The air was crim&s;oned with the flames of the gaoler's hou&s;e, and his fur|niture was ca&s;t into a bonfire, which &s;parkled in my eyes like an offering to the Godde&s;s of Rea&s;on, or like that glorious flame which con&s;umed all bonds and engagements when equality was e&s;tabli&s;hed by Lycurgus at Sparta.</P>
<P>I ha&s;tened to &s;econd the attack upon this grand fortre&s;s, by leading my followers into Newgate-&s;treet, where, with &s;ledge-hammers, crows, and iron-palli&s;adoes, we &s;oon broke an entrance into the&s;e dete&s;table abodes, where the poor criminals were panting for freedom. With a high ladder, and in the &s;ight of thou&s;ands, I &s;caled the lofty walls, exulting as I ro&s;e at the glorious pro&s;pect before us, and waving my colours as a trophy of conque&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;oon penetrated into the wards of this almo&s;t impenetrable building, which &s;hort-&s;ighted politi|cians might have &s;uppo&s;ed capable of repul&s;ing an invading army; but the energies of the people are irre&s;i&s;tible when determined on emancipation, and <HI>unoppo&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>Fire-balls and fire-brands &s;oon &s;et the timbers in flames. I ran from one ward to the next, and from cell to cell, &s;ounding the tidings of liberty, and receiving a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings from tho&s;e tongues which had too often been turned to cur&s;es and exe|crations. Pick-pockets, cut-pur&s;es, &s;hop-lifters, and felons of every denomination, hailed the dawn of returning freedom, and &s;prung forward to a glori|ous con&s;ummation, helping us to de&s;troy this dread|ful tomb to all who de&s;pi&s;e the laws, and claim the natural privilege of dividing property.</P>
<P>The flames raged and run with rapidity among the thick oak planking, which cracked with the
<PB N="64" REF="038973_0075_1012832FEF1A7CA8">
noi&s;e of thunder; the &s;moke and heat was nearly &s;uffocating, and many in their over eagerne&s;s to clear the dungeons, fell martyrs in the glorious cau&s;e. In a cell which I had nearly overlooked, I found a mi&s;erable wretch half naked upon the ground. I had broke open his door with an iron crow, and the fir&s;t object that he &s;aw was a tre|mendous blaze of light, which proceeded from the oppo&s;ite wain&s;cot on fire. He had long heard the &s;houts of exulting thou&s;ands, and the bur&s;tings of the fire. 'Heaven and earth,' cried he, 'is the day of judgment come? or have I &s;unk alive into hell? Are you a fiend?' &s;aid he, &s;taring wildly, and &s;tarting from me. 'Are you come to pitch me into everla&s;ting flames?'</P>
<P>To &s;ay truth, my figure was not a little hideous, for I was covered with all &s;orts of dirt, &s;welled in my face from the different brui&s;es I had received, and &s;treaked with blood from a cut in my head by the falling of a plank: but how was I a&s;toni&s;hed to perceive, by the light of the fire, the great Stupeo, the wonderful philo&s;opher, in chains.</P>
<P>'Exult,' cried I, 'you are revenged, my ma&s;ter, my tutor, liberty has reared her &s;tandard on the&s;e walls, and the fabric of &s;elfi&s;h tyranny is tumbling about our ears. Ha&s;te, get the&s;e irons off, and join in the noble cau&s;e of liberty and man.'</P>
<P>Stupeo immediately &s;tarted up, uttering incohe|rent expre&s;&s;ions of joy. I hurried him from the chamber of his &s;tudies into the pre&s;s-yard, where his dete&s;table fetters were knocked off, and being refre&s;hed with a large goblet of wine from the cel|lars of the gaoler, we went into the &s;treet to enjoy the exultation of the &s;urrounding multitude, and the mo&s;t tremendous &s;ight that can well be con|ceived; a &s;ight which awed the military into inac|tion, and &s;truck the magi&s;trates into a panic of the

mo&s;t pu&s;illanimous nature: but cowardice is ever allied to terror, and I &s;tood con&s;idering how be&s;t to exert the force now in action, that the greate&s;t blow might be &s;truck to the pre&s;ent dete&s;table &s;y&s;|tem of monopolized property.</P>
<P>Part of the army of patriots remained upon the walls, and dancing round the ruins to prevent every attempt at extingui&s;hing the flames: the re&s;t followed Stupeo and my&s;elf, who encouraged them to per&s;evere and be free. The crowd would have de&s;troyed Langdale's, a large di&s;tillers, in Holborn, but I repre&s;ented that this was a paltry bu&s;ine&s;s, when we had yet to open the doors of &s;o many gaols to the liberation of our brethren; be&s;ides, we had already near four hundred felons among&s;t us, and the augmentation of this force was a grand point, for who could fight for freedom like tho&s;e who had experienced its lo&s;s? or who would level property like tho&s;e who had nothing to lo&s;e, and all to gain.</P>
<P>As we proceeded, every pa&s;&s;enger was &s;topped and plundered, and from every hou&s;e was collected, two or three times over, con&s;iderable contributions. I would have remon&s;trated, but a fellow, who had been confined on a charge of murder, and whom I had liberated, &s;wore he would rip me up alive if I attempted to prevent it; and indeed, though his argument was not in the line of rea&s;on, Stupeo re|conciled me to the practice.</P>
<P>'In revolutions and public commotions,' &s;aid he, 'no man in Athens was allowed to be neutral: every man who does not fight for us, ought to be con&s;idered as again&s;t us and if we follow the new philo&s;ophy, we &s;hould &s;hew no mercy to tho&s;e who &s;upport the &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An article in the Jacobin Creed.</NOTE></P>
<P>Having liberated the pri&s;oners in Clerkenwell,
<PB N="66" REF="038973_0077_10128336940D7028">
our forces were divided to objects of le&s;s moment. That divi&s;ion under our direction proceeded to Lord Mansfield's; and there liberty and rational princi|ples received a complete triumph over all regular order. The mu&s;ty records of precedents, ca&s;es and law, made a fire to warm the people they had &s;o long en&s;laved: I own I wi&s;hed to have pre&s;erved &s;everal works of curio&s;ity and art, but Stupeo would not &s;uffer a thing to be taken&mdash;'Let them all pe|ri&s;h together,' &s;aid he, 'we have yet remaining too much of art to be happy; let us not &s;tain the cau&s;e with the appearance of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.'</P>
<P>'But why then,' &s;aid I, 'are we to plunder the poor inhabitants? Surely it were better to &s;upply our&s;elves from &s;tores like the&s;e?'</P>
<P>'No,' an&s;wered he, 'can you not perceive that the de&s;truction of property mu&s;t be the grand aim; from tho&s;e who have little we mu&s;t take that little, and the hoards of affluence mu&s;t be utterly de&s;troy|ed. As long as one &s;ingle cart-load of property remains in any country, there will be no genuine equality.'</P>
<P>From the&s;e ever-memorable exploits, I and Stupeo, with &s;everal &s;elect leaders, retired to an ob|&s;cure public-hou&s;e, to contrive and arrange the un|dertakings of the en&s;uing night. I already fancied my&s;elf as great as the immortal John the Painter.</P>
<P>At our meeting, &s;everal foreigners of <HI>liberal principles</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cant word for no principles but tho&s;e of profligacy, irreligion, &amp;c.</NOTE> were pre&s;ent. A plan was propo&s;ed for organizing the body of the people, and urging them to throw off the yoke of dependence, and declare them&s;elves free. A paper, entitled <HI>The Thunderer</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Political Magazine for 1780.</NOTE>, was drawn up by Stupeo, which he hoped would

kindle the glow of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and awake the peo|ple to their rights.</P>
<P>The pri&s;ons were condemned to de&s;truction, that none of our brave followers might be deprived of their liberty. The New-river water was to be cut off, that we might have the town effectually at command, and compel tho&s;e weak and ob&s;tinate people who were afraid of joining our &s;tandard. The Mu&s;eum we fixed upon as a good depo&s;it for &s;tores, after all that trumpery &s;hould be burnt, which gives edge to a childi&s;h employment of time. The toll-hou&s;es on the bridge we condemned, be|cau&s;e bridges ought to be built without &s;ubjecting individuals to expen&s;e. The Ea&s;t-India ware|hou&s;es and the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e we con&s;idered as large lumber rooms for monopolizing property that be|longed to every body.</P>
<P>The Tower and the Bank were two grand ob|jects, behind which we could entrench in defiance of the troops which were drawing towards the town from every quarter; and indeed our plans were too exten&s;ive and grand for me to detail in minutiae.</P>
<P>In the attack upon the Bank I was &s;everely wounded in the hand by a mu&s;ket bullet, for there the &s;oldiers recovered their thir&s;t for blood, and fired upon the innocent people, who were gloriou&s;ly fighting for liberty. We determined there to con|quer or die, being &s;trongly reinforced by the Bo|rough patriots, who had burnt the toll-hou&s;es on the bridge in their rout. To place a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our cau&s;e before them, an hor&s;e loaded with the chains of Newgate, was driven through the crowd in place of colours, and every brea&s;t beat with throbs of vengeance at the &s;ight.</P>
<P>A body of &s;avages on hor&s;eback cut down &s;eve|veral with their &s;words, and the infantry made u&s;e of their infernal mu&s;kets, which &s;everely galled the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">narmed patriots. It was &s;hocking to hear the tre|mendous roar of exulting rage &s;ink after every pla|toon, as if it was exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>Poor Stupeo, who &s;tood be&s;ide me encouraging a band of tho&s;e, whom the ignorant call felons, to an attack on the infantry with iron &s;pikes and bottles, received a &s;hot that laid him dead be&s;ide me. The mob, who now began to faint from the unequal conte&s;t, trampled over him, and hurried me along with them. I endeavoured to rally them, and one of them da&s;hed a link into my face, which I re|turned by &s;hooting him with a pi&s;tol, for I had found a very good pair in an hou&s;e we had gutted, and nothing could be more proper than turning the weapons of tyrants again&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I was confounded at the fickle di&s;po&s;ition of a mob, which can only ari&s;e from their want of in|&s;truction; and &s;o long as what is called civil order and police exi&s;ts, I very much fear the people will never unanimou&s;ly ri&s;e: but, however, truth is making a rapid progre&s;s, and it mu&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly break forth into a glorious day.</P>
<P>The mob would have executed &s;ummary ju&s;tice upon me for the murder of the lint-bearer, had I not e&s;caped through the narrow &s;treets into Hol|born, where Langdal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (the di&s;tiller) was on fire.

<P>I WAS &s;o agitated by the failure of our glorious cau&s;e, that I was nearly putting a period to my exi&s;t|ence, e&s;pecially when I recollected the &s;hocking and infamous &s;y&s;tem of a con&s;titution, which none but fools can &s;ee <HI>any one</HI> virtue in; and this was, that every man who had &s;uffered by this efferve&s;cence of liberty, would receive &s;atisfaction for his lo&s;&s;es, and thus the people would be made to pay for what they had de&s;troyed; &s;o that our failing in the ultimatum was wor&s;e than if nothing had been done, and we

<P>I wi&s;hed my&s;elf away from &s;uch a dete&s;table country as England, where property is guarded with as much vigilance as if it were a deity; and no man, however obnoxious, can be plundered, without a right of retribution from the pari&s;h or county, a thing totally unknown in other countries, and quite inimical to genuine liberty.</P>

<P>I was very little acquainted with the town, hav|ing been there only upon one or two vacations; but the light of the fires, and the brilliance of the illu|minations were &s;ufficient guides. Several watch|men looked as if they intended to &s;top me, but awed by the dignity of my countenance, though covered with blood and dirt, they all &s;lunk away, &s;o pow|erful is the effect of innocence and impre&s;&s;ive re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>I arrived oppo&s;ite a bonfire, where the furniture of a Roman Catholic milliner was blazing; it made but a paltry light, compared with the many others that gleamed in the air; and the noble band that danced around it being a&s;hamed to be out-done in their patriotic exertions, in the goodne&s;s of their hearts dragged the bed from beneath two infants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Political Magazine, 1780.</NOTE> and a woman in labor, which gave a great, but tran&s;ient addition to the fire. To be &s;ure, the poor woman died of fright, but that could not be helped in &s;uch a ca&s;e; and it is the ill-education of women which introduces all &s;orts of nervous affections.</P>
<P>In a little back alley I met an old woman carry|ing &s;omething in her apron; at my approach &s;he ap|peared very much frightened. 'What have you got there?' &s;aid I. She replied, trembling, 'only &s;ome trifles, your honour, that I have pre&s;erved from fire.' I required to &s;ee tho&s;e trifles. Accordingly &s;he opened her apron, di&s;playing &s;ome gold fringe, a &s;ilver cen&s;er, and two cups, which &s;he had taken

<P>'Aye, and that I will: come to my little lodg|ing, my dear babe, you need not be frighted at no|body there.'</P>
<P>Accordingly I followed her into a mi&s;erable hou&s;e, up three pair of &s;tairs, into a back garret. A crucifix &s;tood on a chimney-piece, and a &s;tring of beads hung upon a nail, by which I &s;oon di&s;covered that this good lady, who had been plundering a chapel, was a Romani&s;t; and I rejoiced to find that knowledge had reached even into a back garret, and taught an old woman to di&s;cern the cau&s;e of man|kind from the bigotry of prie&s;tcraft</P>
<P>With this ho&s;pitable creature, who was an Iri&s;h woman, I determined to re&s;ide. Being extremely jaded and pained by my brui&s;es, I went immediately to bed, and &s;he ha&s;tened to procure me &s;ome refre&s;h|ment.

<P>When the fermentation of my &s;pirits began to cool, in &s;pite of all my efforts, I became nearly di&s;|tracted. I had lo&s;t three of my teeth, and my whole body was brui&s;ed: the cut in my head, to be &s;ure, was only an inch and half long, and a finger deep; but I had a mu&s;ket wound in my hand, which had taken off half my little finger, and grazed the re&s;t, &s;o that I was not in the mo&s;t comfortable &s;ituation.

I found her a very &s;ingular character, within a truly feminine form; &s;he had a &s;oul of ma&s;culine energy; every thought of her mind &s;eemed received by intuition. She was often right by this means, only in matters of mere &s;peculation; &s;he adopted one and rejected another, <HI>by a &s;ort of tact,</HI> and the force of a culti|vated imagination; and yet, <HI>though upon the whole &s;he rea&s;oned little,</HI> it is &s;urpri&s;ing what degree of &s;oundne&s;s was in all her determination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader may find many of the&s;e &s;entiments in the Life of Mrs. Wol&s;tonecraft.</NOTE>. My di&s;|po&s;ition frequently led me to waver in the practice I had adopted: I doubted, and I &s;ometimes feared; but my o&s;cillations and &s;ceptici&s;m were fixed by her boldne&s;s. When a true opinion emanated in this way from another mind, the conviction produced in my own, a&s;&s;umed a &s;ingular character.

<P>A woman of the&s;e &s;entiments was congenial to my &s;oul; our di&s;cour&s;es were a fea&s;t to the mind, in which the &s;en&s;es had no &s;hare. She frequently lamented the evils to which nature had nece&s;&s;itated her &s;ex in the article of children; a &s;ubject which &s;he never could di&s;cu&s;s with patience, it being an evil to which man was not &s;ubjected, and a badge of bondage not to be overthrown.</P>
<P>'Oh! cried &s;he, one day to me, in a fit of en|thu&s;ia&s;m, 'what &s;ignifies all the freedom of our &s;ouls, all the exaltations of our intellects, if we are to be confined for months to carry a burden which we have no means to lay down, and when the little wretch appears in the world, what a dreadful idea: &mdash;with intellects that &s;oar beyond the firmament, are we to be confined to &s;waddle and dandle an ani|mal that has no ideas, and mu&s;t at every moment de&s;troy it&s;elf if we do not pre&s;erve it?

<P>The hu&s;band of my Mary had expected to find in her that &s;oftne&s;s, complacency, and mode&s;ty, which none but idiots ought to require, and which are merely calculated to fit a woman for a &s;eraglio, or a play-thing to a voluptuary. He had taught him&s;elf to de&s;ire a female, who might &s;olace him after his bu&s;ine&s;s, with the endearments of a mind that had no will but his own, and &s;ought to oblige the man who preferred her to all her &s;ex. But Mary was of a different nature&mdash;her &s;oul was not to be confined in a gilded cage, and &s;he would not bow to the ba&s;haw dictates of a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The poor wretch became di&s;tracted at her lo&s;s. In place of taking another, he was perpetually rav|ing about conjugal affection, the claims of children, the duties of wives, and &s;uch ignorant prejudices, till his &s;en&s;es &s;ailed him, and his friends &s;ent him to Bethlem Ho&s;pital. The children who had none to provide for them, were &s;ent to the work-hou&s;e, to be educated by the public, where they caught the &s;mall-pox, and died; an event, which ought natu|rally to have been expected, when they had not been inoculated, and could not throw any blame upon the conduct of their mother.</P>
<P>After this incident we continued on the mo&s;t har|monious footing, for though Mary allowed her&s;elf
<PB N="84" REF="038973_0095_1012836A21EA1930">
the conver&s;ation of many of the oppo&s;ite &s;ex, I did not experience the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, for &s;he had as much right as my&s;elf to all the <HI>excentricities of fancy</HI>; and I never thought her the wor&s;e for having con|tributed to the happine&s;s of other human beings.</P>
<P>About a month after this, the poor hu&s;band died delirious, one of the mo&s;t &s;tupid deaths a man could die, for the lo&s;s of a woman: and Mary, thus freed from the &s;hadow of a tie, appeared with me openly in public. Our neighbours made their u&s;ual rude comments upon our intercour&s;e; and becau&s;e &s;eve|ral gentlemen pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome hand&s;ome pre&s;ents upon Mary, they circulated the calumny, that I kept my wife as a pro&s;titute.</P>
<P>I de&s;pi&s;ed all this; I was not to be frightened into any act becau&s;e of &s;candal, and I had long re|garded marriage with &s;o well grounded an appre|hen&s;ion, that, notwith&s;tanding the partiality for Ma|ry that had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, I &s;hould have felt it very difficult, at lea&s;t in the pre&s;ent &s;tage of our intercour&s;e, to have re&s;olved on &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ea&s;|u&s;e; thus, partly from &s;imilar, and partly from dif|ferent motives, we felt alike in this, as we did perhaps in every other circum&s;tance that related to our in|tercour&s;e.</P>
<P>The human mind delights in variety. It is im|po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be forever attached to one par|ticular object. This change Mary experienced be|fore my&s;elf; and &s;he parted from me for the prot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tion of my friend Williams, who certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very powerful attractions, and was an athletic fig|ure.</P>
<P>I regretted this &s;eparation, but was not fool enough to repine; and I determined, according to the maxims of the great Stupeo, in&s;tantly to &s;elect &s;ome other; though it was difficult to find one with &s;uch an under&s;tanding as to march forward to

the high gaol of rea&s;on, trampling down prejudice, &s;uper&s;tition, and character, in its career.</P>
<P>While I was in &s;earch of &s;uch a female, I wrote, by way of amu&s;ement, a little tract, proving that girls ought to receive the &s;ame education as boys; that the &s;ame exerci&s;es ought to be pur&s;ued by each, and that beauty was not of the &s;malle&s;t value, when compared to a robu&s;t con&s;titution, that feared nei|ther wind nor weather. I proved, beyond contra|diction, that every thing called the graces, &s;uch as mu&s;ic, &s;inging, dancing, timidity, delicacy, and ba&s;hfulne&s;s, ought to be exploded.</P>
<P>I know not how it was, but my book was only bought by a few; and the ari&s;tocratic critics con|demned it, as the work of a man who paid no re|gard to truth, provided he made him&s;elf &s;ingular: which was an ab&s;olute libel, for I had lo&s;t in the cau&s;e of truth, three teeth and half my little finger.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I did not under&s;tand the &s;ubject. When a man writes a book of <HI>methodical</HI> information, he does not write becau&s;e he under&s;tands the &s;ubject, but he under&s;tands the &s;ubject becau&s;e he has writ|ten.

<P>Frequently, by way of amu&s;ement, I attended the &s;ix-penny debating &s;ocieties, where truth is propa|gated in every branch, and religion and government attacked from behind a ma&s;ked battery. A debate on the beauty of a coquet, or the merits of a beau, was &s;ufficient to introduce annotations on de&s;poti&s;m,

and &s;atires on nobility, to the edification of the igno|rant and young, who are thus prepared to re|ceive all the enlightened principles of the new &s;chool. It is a&s;toni&s;hing what energy rea&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es, when adorned with all the flowers of oratory: and it was in vain that a man of narrow opinions &s;hould endeavour to be heard; for let him &s;ay what he would, he was unattended to. I was, however, di&s;gu&s;ted at a little trifle, for I could not endure the &s;malle&s;t duplicity, which is beneath the dignity of man, and ought not to be permitted even in the promotion of general knowledge. This trifle was a quarrel between Citizen Cow and Citizen Calf, about which &s;ide of the que&s;tion they &s;hould take: the one in&s;i&s;ting that he could declaim be&s;t on the &s;ide of liberty, and the other declaring his own tal|ent lay in di&s;covering faults. I was a&s;hamed that &s;uch great men &s;hould wrangle about the parts they were to act, like the performers of a country barn; and I could not but con&s;ider, that the cau&s;e of lib|erty mu&s;t &s;uffer, when garbled by the pal&s;ied efforts of men, who&s;e object was a dividend of &s;ix-pences, to be &s;pent the &s;ame evening in a debauch.</P>
<P>One evening, at the hazard-table, a young man, who had been &s;itting near &s;ix and thirty hours, at|tracted univer&s;al attention by the extravagant exe|crations he uttered, and the agitation of his mind. He prote&s;ted that he was ruined and undone to all perdition.</P>
<P>My feelings are ever peculiarly alive to the &s;uf|ferings of my fellows, and though I endeavoured to guard again&s;t fal&s;e pity, I am frequently melting at the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my fellow mortals. I followed the poor wretch home at a di&s;tance, and entering his room abruptly, I found him &s;itting in a chair, with a fine young woman hanging on his &s;houlder weep|ing, and a child &s;leeping in a cradle.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="038973_0098_101283734370C0A8">He &s;tarted up confu&s;ed at my entrance, and would have made an apology, but I &s;oon tranquil|ized him, and pre&s;&s;ing him with the irre&s;i&s;tible argu|ments of truth to rely on my &s;ervices, he confe&s;&s;ed that he had wronged an excellent ma&s;ter to a con&s;id|erable amount, under the fallacious hope, that by hazarding it at the gaming-table, he might acquire an independence, his &s;alary being too &s;mall to enable him to keep a family and appear as he mu&s;t; that he had now lo&s;t the means of concealing his crime, and &s;hould bring &s;hame on his wife and his relations by a public death.</P>
<P>I was affected at the dreadful &s;ituation, for though his feelings were fal&s;e, he having a ju&s;t claim on his ma&s;ter's property, yet, in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things he would have all mankind again&s;t him; I therefore determined to let him have two hundred pounds, the whole amount of my ca&s;h, which would cover his affairs for the pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>I felt my&s;elf in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation, and pre&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides by very urgent claims, the merit of which required reflection.&mdash;'My dear Williams,' &s;aid I, 'more than ever I lament the death of the illuminated Stupeo; he would with one word have relieved our embarra&s;&s;ment; but, tell me your&s;elf,

<P>'It is &s;ufficient,' &s;aid I, 'you are right.' He accompanied me home, where I delivered him, within a guinea, of all I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. It was u&s;ele&s;s to vi&s;it the young man when I could not relieve him, and I had no inclination to in&s;ult di&s;tre&s;s. I was happy in having &s;aved Williams from impri&s;onment, though the di&s;appointment Jack&s;on mu&s;t endure in the failure of my offers now and then intervened, but I remembered that no man ought to place de|pendence upon any but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I cannot remember the conclu&s;ion of this inci|dent without regret, and the reflection that philo|&s;ophy cannot always direct us among&s;t the doub|lings and mazes of human affairs. The young man was apprehended the next day, and his wife running forward to the mo&s;t &s;ini&s;ter conclu&s;ions, ca&s;t her&s;elf in the Thames, where &s;he was unfortunately drowned.</P>
<P>I grieved, but grief was u&s;ele&s;s, after the event; I execrated the cu&s;toms of mankind, and drew &s;ome comfort in remembering that I had probably &s;aved Williams from equal calamity.&mdash;I ha&s;tened to his lodgings, to pour out to him and Mary the tumults of an agitated &s;oul, but I was informed that they had departed, before break of day, nobody knew where; and that a warrant was out again&s;t him for having cheated a gentleman with cogged dice.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck dumb at this account, which in|formed me that I was a beggar; and the woman of the hou&s;e hinted that I was implicated in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s.

My mind was, however, clear of this a&s;per|&s;ion; it was too manly to de&s;cend to other fine&s;&s;e than that of &s;kill; but I could not reconcile the be|haviour of Williams to any maxim of truth or po|litical ju&s;tice; for if there be not <HI>common hone&s;ty</HI> among&s;t tho&s;e the vulgar call rogues, how are the affairs of life to be conducted?</P>
<P>The accidents I had witne&s;&s;ed re&s;ulting from gaming, had &s;tartled my mind, yet I preferred it to binding my&s;elf a &s;lave to the caprices of any man. This re&s;ource was now become dangerous. No man from per&s;ua&s;ion, would render me a portion of the &s;uperfluities he enjoyed, and in the mid&s;t of &s;o|ciety which calls it&s;elf poli&s;hed, I mu&s;t either la|bour in employ, beneath the dignity of a ration|al being, or peri&s;h unpitied or unrelieved.</P>
<P>Occupied with the&s;e reflections, I returned to my lodgings, ab&s;orbed in a gloomy melancholy. Mankind appeared to me a &s;et of &s;elfi&s;h, &s;olitary animals in the mid&s;t of &s;ociety, and &s;o far from being a&s;&s;ociated for mutual protection, they &s;eem only to live for them&s;elves.</P>

As to taxes, the poor in this country pay very few in proportion to the rich; their cottages are exempt, they are not va&s;&s;als who work without pay (as in mo&s;t countries of the world,) and tho&s;e who wi&s;h to live in peace, may do it with as much &s;ecurity as a lord; their per&s;ons and their little all are equally &s;acred in the eye of the law, and except in the article of game, <HI>equally free.</HI> It is the drunken, the idle, and the vicious, who have their families &s;tarving, and a burden to the pari&s;h. But &s;uch is the &s;ingular con&s;titution of the country, that no Engli&s;hman can die of ab&s;olute want, if he will appeal to the charitable in&s;titu|tions. In fact, it is the middle cla&s;s of people who bear the great burden of the &s;tate: the poor are exactly the &s;ame as they were a thou&s;and years ago, and were, and will be always the &s;ame under every form of government, with the exception of per&s;onal freedom and protection. It is to be remembered that taxes ought never to be murmured at, provi|ded they are applied to public affairs. I am, how|ever, grieved when I reflect that the upright, peace|able, and loyal citizen pays at lea&s;t one third more than his ju&s;t portion, to make up the deficiency oc|ca&s;ioned by the &s;neaking, mi&s;erly part of the rich&punc; and by the mock patriot evading every impo&s;t he can flinch from&mdash;thus &s;tabbing the country he pre|tends to weep over.'</P>

<P>I was rou&s;ed from the&s;e reflections by the creak|ings of a gibbet on the highway, and could not avoid &s;huddering at the inhuman &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>'O property!' &s;aid I, 'this is one of thy ble&s;|&s;ed effects&mdash;what a dreadful exhibition of inju&s;tice glares upon the thinking mind, that death &s;hall be the fate of the man who by force exerts the rights of nature. In the principles of Penal Law, we are told near an hundred per&s;ons annually are exe|cuted. Oh ye victims of this infernal monopoli|zing &s;cheme, the whole amount of the goods (vul|garly called &s;tolen) is only threefourths per cent. upon moveable property, yet they hang you up on the highway. Perhaps you were obliged to &s;hoot &s;omebody in &s;elf-defence, and mu&s;t ye die for that?

There is, indeed, a bright gleam breaking through this dark picture, which enables the private patriot to tax the property of the&s;e dealers in wealth; this is the article of <HI>ba&s;e coin,</HI> amounting, it is true, to no more than one million a year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the excellent Treati&s;e on the Police of the Metropo|lis, which, though certainly exaggerated in &s;ome of the calcula|tions, de&s;erves the attention of every man.</NOTE>.

contemplate this mighty Colo&s;&s;us of proper|ty, which threatens to devour up the Rights of Man, and re&s;i&s;t all the open and &s;ecret attacks of philo&s;ophers, and we &s;hall &s;ee how nece&s;&s;ary it is by every means to render property le&s;s &s;ecure. Let us rea&s;on calmly, and without prejudice, and to any man of liberal ideas, what is the moral turpi|tude of robbery? It is no more than taking by force what I have a natural right to: it is an he|roic and generous way of exerting the claims of nature and Agrarian ju&s;tice; and the hazard I run is the &s;ame as every patriot mu&s;t lay open to, who excites revolutions, and proclaims the glad tid|ings of univer&s;al emancipation. The one, as well as the other, is dete&s;ted by all men who are blinded by religion, and the prejudices of the old &s;chool. It becomes, therefore, the part of every patriot, who would nobly re&s;i&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, to be|gin by counteracting the unju&s;t di&s;tribution of property; and were they all to a man boldly and heroicly to &s;et out on the high road, they would &s;oon render wealth le&s;s &s;ecure, and its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors le&s;s arrogant. It may be objected, that this would not be &s;o manly as at once throwing off the yoke of bondage: but till the <HI>march</HI> of &s;entiment has proceeded to univer&s;al conviction, the next great|e&s;t good ought to be preferred to li&s;tle&s;s inactivity.'</P>
<P>Such were my reflections while I &s;tood gazing at the gibbet: I ridiculed the idea that it would act as a re&s;traint: it was in my eyes like the mangled body of Cae&s;ar, which only &s;timulated to revenge. I con&s;idered the poor victim as unju&s;tly ma&s;&s;acred by the iron-fi&s;ted law, for though he had commit|ted murder, that was no rea&s;on for coercion in the code of political ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>My mind was impre&s;&s;ed with a maje&s;tic and in|dependent tone, re&s;ulting from tho&s;e ideas. I felt

<P>I drew out my pi&s;tols, and marched forward along the middle of the road, which the po&s;tillion perceiving, &s;purred his hor&s;es, with an intention to ride over me.

The hor&s;es taking fright, tore away from my gra&s;p, and rode over the po&s;til|ion, who was much brui&s;ed, and had one leg broke.</P>
<P>This unfortunate accident extremely chagrined me, but I con&s;oled my&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible with remembering, that partial evil will ever attach to general good. The <HI>immortal</HI> Stupeo, before he died, u&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that nature in her fecundity, produced all things in &s;uperfluity, that much might be &s;pared for the de&s;truction of accident, as in the produce of animals and vegetables; and man, being nothing but a brute, was al&s;o &s;upplied in greater numbers than &s;ufficient; in fact, that the death of two or three hundred thou&s;and was a matter of no moment, and ab&s;olutely unworthy to fill the mind's eye a &s;econd in the contemplation of a great event.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments were clear as the broad ba&s;e of truth; for what man could walk out on a &s;ummer's day, if he feared cru&s;hing the in&s;ects in his path?

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. The Vagabond concludes his Story&mdash;the Effects of Refor|mation in a country pari&s;h&mdash;the Vagabond's rea&s;ons in favour of Seduction.</HEAD>
<P>ON the following day I &s;topped a po&s;t-chai&s;e in a cro&s;s road, which contained two ladies, and was driven by a lad. One of the women fainted away, and the other was exce&s;&s;ively frightened. I took nothing but her pur&s;e, informing her, that &s;he mi&s;|took, if &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed me a common robber; for, though I was willing to equalize property, I did not wi&s;h to monopolize. So &s;aying, I quitted her, that &s;he might a&s;&s;i&s;t her in&s;en&s;ible companion.</P>
<P>I could not but execrate the whole &s;y&s;tem of fe|male education, which thus enervates the human body; it being an eternal fact, that were women educated to all the exerci&s;es of men, and, as my dear Mary u&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;o mingled with the world, that every action would he performed promi&s;cuou&s;|ly, (&s;ex out of the que&s;tion) we &s;hould not have wo|men fainting on &s;udden emergencies, and as imbe|cile as infants.</P>
<P>What a glorious thing would it be, if the whole female &s;ex would emancipate them&s;elves from tho&s;e tyrants the men, and enter equally into every con|cern

of life! We &s;hould then no longer admire a beautiful idiot, but value them according to their mental charms and per&s;onal prowe&s;s. It would al&s;o be a very great advantage in the article of love, it being no incon&s;iderable trouble to a philo&s;ophical mind to bend to all the frivolities of declaring a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>By the exertions of my independent principles, I acquired a &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but I always made it a rule never to put in my claim to a part of the univer&s;al &s;tock, till nece&s;&s;ity (which has no law) in &s;ome &s;ort compelled me. It was on one of tho&s;e occa&s;ions I had the good fortune to meet with you, and I only lament that the immortal Stupeo was killed with a mu&s;ket bullet.</P>
<P>'I lament too,' &s;aid Doctor Alogos; 'I &s;hould have delighted in the conver&s;ation of &s;o great a man, who has introduced &s;o enlightened a pupil to the world. But let us now retire to re&s;t; the clock has &s;truck three, and to-morrow we will di&s;cour&s;e further.' So &s;aying, they &s;eparated for the night: Frederick rejoicing that he had at length found a man illuminated with the irradiating principles of the new philo&s;ophy; which he the more wondered at, con&s;idering the Doctor's <HI>property,</HI> for he had found the pupils of the new &s;chool, in general, a little &s;hort in financial affairs.</P>
<P>The next morning the company met to breakfa&s;t. Laura was extremely lovely; and the eyes of the philo&s;opher frequently repeated the ob&s;ervation. Su&s;an &s;at down familiarly to breakfa&s;t with them; and the luxury of the times was ably de&s;canted upon.</P>
<P>Tea and chocolate, new bread and fre&s;h butter, with a reli&s;h of cold ham and eggs, compo&s;ed the breakfa&s;t of the&s;e practical philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>'Luxury,' cried Doctor Alogos at every mouth|ful, 'will be the bane of this country; every thing

ri&s;es to &s;o enormous a price, that a poor man can|not ab&s;olutely get an exi&s;tence; we &s;hall be &s;tarv|ed!'</P>
<P>'It is a dreadful thing' to think of it,' &s;aid Fred|erick; 'I have often con&s;idered what could occa|&s;ion &s;uch a ri&s;e in meat, for in&s;tance; formerly we u&s;ed to have the be&s;t beef at one penny a pound, and now it is &s;ixpence.'</P>
<P>'I apprehend,' &s;aid Laura, 'that there are two rea&s;ons: the increa&s;ed con&s;umption, and the increa&s;|ed quantity of money. Formerly, a farmer, before he killed an ox, had to contract with &s;o many fami|lies as could purcha&s;e the whole, not being able to place a dependence on chance cu&s;tom; a fact that mu&s;t give the lie to the tales of &s;ome people, who would make us believe that day labourers fed upon roa&s;ted beef.'</P>
<P>'You are a little perver&s;e jade,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'to dare contradict a man like me. Pray, how &s;hould you know what u&s;ed to be, who have not yet &s;een eighteen &s;ummers?&mdash;You are a moth in the creation yet, I in&s;i&s;t upon it that our pea&s;ants are &s;tarved and fami&s;hed:&mdash;Are not potatoes and bacon half their &s;upport?&mdash;An&s;wer that.'</P>
<P>The Doctor enjoyed the triumph of rhetoric over common &s;en&s;e; but Laura, with becoming defer|ence, replied, that it might be true, but that was even better than &s;kimmed milk and oatmeal cake, which was formerly the general food, with a change of barley and rye. 'The people of England, then,' &s;aid &s;he, 'were &s;ubject to lepro&s;y and cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, which have vani&s;hed &s;ince the introduction of tea. I grant that they live hard, but it is what they have ever done; and were it po&s;&s;ible for them to &s;ee the pea&s;ants of other countries, they would rejoice at being people of England. Not to men|tion the powers of life and death, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by mo&s;t

landed gentlemen on the continent, let us look at the ea&s;tern nations, who&s;e lower orders live upon nothing but rice, and particularly the Chine&s;e, &s;up|po&s;ed, in the Annual Regi&s;ter for 1789, to contain <HI>two hundred millions</HI> of people, who&s;e lower orders, in-land, ta&s;te nothing but rice and water, and on the &s;ea-coa&s;t a little fi&s;h.'</P>
<P>'Rice and fi&s;h!' &s;aid the Doctor, 'I am per|&s;uaded they are both primitive di&s;hes. Rice is the food of more than half the human &s;pecies, and &s;ava|ges on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts univer&s;ally eat fi&s;h. I am de|termined my table &s;hall be furni&s;hed with the&s;e pro|ductions of all-provident nature; and &s;uppo&s;e, for the &s;econd cour&s;e, you give us a brace of roa&s;t ca|pons and a few tartlets.'</P>
<P>'For my part,' &s;aid Frederick, laying a &s;lice of ham on his bread and butter, and putting three lumps of &s;ugar into his cup of chocolate, 'it is to me a matter of the greate&s;t indifference what I eat; I eat merely becau&s;e it is right to eat for the keeping our bodies in order. A family phy&s;ician proves, that one half the nece&s;&s;ity of eating is to di&s;tend the in|te&s;tines; for which purpo&s;e, any farinaceous pa&s;te is &s;ufficient; and I have an intention to try a pud|ding of <HI>marble flour;</HI> for, if this proves true, what great exploits may be performed without the trouble of carrying bread!'</P>
<P>'For heaven's &s;ake!' &s;aid Laura, laughing, 'forego the experiment, or the images of Jupiter and Juno, in the garden, will be made into ha&s;ty|pudding; and the arm of Venus will have as much temptation as an haunch of veni&s;on.'</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, the Doctor reque&s;ted Frederick to walk in his garden, and help him to weed &s;ome beds of herbs.</P>
<P>'Do you think,' &s;aid Frederick, 'after what I have told you, that I will degrade my dignity by a
<PB N="109" REF="038973_0120_101283B3B4E1C3F8">
menial employ? that I will become a &s;lave to till the ground?'</P>
<P>'No,' replied the Doctor; 'you are a philo&s;o|pher; I do not propo&s;e to you any &s;uch thing; but hu&s;bandry is a primitive art, and no di&s;grace when practi&s;ed for exerci&s;e. I propo&s;e that we &s;hall live together on a footing of equality, and that we &s;hall endeavour to enlighten the people in our neighbour|hood, erecting to our&s;elves a little republic.'</P>
<P>'The idea is grand and noble,' cried Frederick: 'had we Stupeo here, his whole &s;oul would enter into the &s;ubject. Let us begin this very day&mdash;only let me ob&s;erve, I will be entirely independent.'</P>
<P>'Of cour&s;e,' &s;aid the Doctor.&mdash;'Though I very much fear we &s;hall never bring them to the &s;tandard of nature. This i&s;land is the &s;ink of &s;lavery. The very elements won't let the people go naked like the Indians of America. What &s;hall we do fir&s;t to|wards bringing about the freedom of man?'</P>
<P>'The fir&s;t great action to be performed, is to convince them of their wrongs&mdash;to &s;hew them they ought to govern the &s;tate; and that, if they do not recover their rights, they will be &s;tarved and en|&s;laved; and that all di&s;tinctions are badges of tyran|ny, and not rewards of merit.'</P>
<P>'But in that point,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'it appears to me cheaper to be&s;tow titles and ribbons than pen&s;ions&mdash;if there were no titles, the pen&s;ion-li&s;t mu&s;t increa&s;e.'</P>
<P>'And &s;uppo&s;e it did,' cried Frederick, 'are we going to do away all profits and rewards? Every man &s;hould labour for the re&s;ulting good.'</P>
<P>'Right, right,' an&s;wered the Doctor. 'But &s;hould we not &s;ay &s;omething on the article of mar|riage? We &s;hall never introduce real liberty till we can do away that Gothic barbarity. There's Su&s;an, a good de&s;erving creature, ju&s;t &s;uch another as

<P>'Hear,' &s;aid Frederick, 'the &s;entiments of the great philo&s;opher Stupeo: When the di&s;tinctions of &s;ociety &s;hall be confounded, and men &s;hall cea&s;e to appropriate a whole female to them&s;elves&mdash;<HI>two</HI> men might ea&s;ily enjoy one woman, becau&s;e it would be <HI>her company</HI> they de&s;ired, and the <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> gratification would be con&s;idered as a trifle. <HI>Rea|&s;onable</HI> men will propagate their &s;pecies; not becau&s;e a certain plea&s;ure is annexed to this action, but becau&s;e it is <HI>right</HI> the &s;pecies &s;hould be propagated, and the <HI>manner</HI> in which they exerci&s;e this function will be regulated by the dictates of rea&s;on and duty. It cannot definitively be affirmed, in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ociety, who is the father of the child; but it is of <HI>no con&s;equence.</HI> I ought to prefer <HI>no</HI> human being to another becau&s;e that being is my father, my wife, or my &s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Godwin's Political Ju&s;tice, 410 page 852.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'What a glorious doctrine!' cried Alogos: 'one might then have as many concubines and children as they could procure. This very rea&s;on alone ought to make us dete&s;t monarchical govern|ment, where what is called &s;acred engagements are obliged to be in &s;ome &s;ort pre&s;erved. I will, this very day, tell the world that I di&s;regard its preju|dices, and Su&s;an &s;hall appear in her proper charac|ter.'</P>
<P>Poor Su&s;an, who was an ignorant, vulgar girl, was &s;o intoxicated with the elevation from the cook|ery, that &s;he re&s;olved to exert the inborn Rights of Women, di&s;daining any longer to &s;uperintend

the kitchen; and the Doctor frequently cur&s;ed &s;oci|ety, which had introduced luxurious di&s;hes.</P>
<P>Mean-while the&s;e two great men exerted their endeavours to reform the pari&s;hioners, and it was not long before the excellent effects of their doctrine became vi&s;ible. The churches, tho&s;e temples of prie&s;tcraft and ignorance, were &s;oon left without vi|&s;itors; and even the elocution of a popular preach|er could not a&s;&s;emble an audience.</P>
<P>The two philo&s;ophers rejoiced at this dawn of rea&s;on, and, the better to <HI>&s;pread</HI> the truth, erected a large barn into a Hall of Rea&s;on, where they un|dertook alternately to read moral lectures.&mdash;Fred|erick there clearly proved, that all religion was the offspring of ignorance, re&s;ulting from ideas, mingled with impre&s;&s;ions, mingled with realities; and that the fir&s;t idea of a Deity was taken from a howling wind on a &s;tormy night; &s;o that, if he did not convince, he confounded his hearers. He, however, proved beyond a doubt, that religion was not of the &s;malle&s;t benefit to mankind, 'It is true,' &s;aid he, in one of his lectures, 'that <HI>architecture</HI> was fir&s;t carried beyond the unpoli&s;hed beam, and the un&s;hapen &s;tone, by the enthu&s;ia&s;m of people to honour an unknown Deity; but could any thing be more ab&s;urd than to rai&s;e great piles of magnifi|cence to nobody knew who? And what was the con&s;equence? Why, the great men then would have great hou&s;es, and no longer live, as they u&s;ed to do, in hovels of mud. It is true that <HI>a&s;tronomy</HI> was fir&s;t &s;tudied for the &s;ake of tracing the power of God in the creation; but what has been the re&s;ult? We have learnt to traver&s;e the ocean, and &s;end people from Europe to tyrannize over the people of Africa. Religion indeed gave birth to all the <HI>arts and &s;ciences,</HI> becau&s;e it was &s;uppo&s;ed the Architect of worlds mu&s;t delight in grandeur, and every co&s;tly
<PB N="112" REF="038973_0123_101283BD5C527D00">
ornament was deemed too little an offering to his abode. But, in my opinion, this would better have been given to the &s;tarving poor&mdash;no doubt the prie&s;ts had their tithes out of it. (Here a loud bur&s;t of applau&s;e broke forth.) It is in vain to &s;ay that monks have been the pre&s;ervers of <HI>literature;</HI> for, at the time they promoted it, they had no in|tention to benefit mankind, and it is the intention which makes the merit. You are told that religion teaches &s;ocial duties; that it is wrong to injure your neighbour, for you &s;hall be hereafter puni&s;hed. Who told you all this? A parcel of prie&s;ts, whom you pay to hold you in darkne&s;s. Are you to be|lieve them, or I who in&s;truct you for nothing? I tell you then that there are no future rewards and puni&s;hments. I am certain no man can prove that there are; and if you read the great book of Nature, it does not &s;ay a word about it. That is the book you ought to &s;tudy, and burn your Bibles, if you would enjoy the world without tho&s;e &s;hocking re|flections about fire and brim&s;tone.'</P>
<P><HI>Moral</HI> lectures like the&s;e could not but influence the minds of the country people, who wondered they had been &s;o long impo&s;ed upon. The Curate was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uing for the tithes, and the par&s;onage was threatened with de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Corn had been dear and &s;carce, owing to a wet &s;ea&s;on; and to render it cheap, a mob of patriots burnt down &s;everal &s;tacks and barns, for which one was hanged and three tran&s;ported.</P>
<P>The Principles of Univer&s;al Equality, and The Catechi&s;m of Nature, the one written by Fred|erick, and the other by Doctor Alogos, were printed and di&s;tributed gratis. The public hou&s;es had each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">club, where the new&s;papers were &s;ub|&s;cribed
<PB N="113" REF="038973_0124_101283C025CF5628">
for, politics di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and ale con&s;umed with genuine liberty; by which means tho&s;e here|tofore ignorant people became <HI>warm advocates</HI> for freedom, and declaimed about the inborn rea&s;on of the human &s;oul, till all rea&s;on was &s;u&s;pended in hilarity, and the whole company <HI>levelled</HI> to a &s;tate of <HI>&s;wini&s;h equality.</HI></P>
<P>They now clearly perceived that the times were the wor&s;t that ever Old England had witne&s;&s;ed; for they every day found them&s;elves le&s;s able to maintain their families; and &s;o far from being ca|pable to pay their rents, they had &s;carcely money &s;ufficient to &s;upport the club, on which depended the &s;alvation of their country.</P>
<P>In vain the gentlemen of the pari&s;h endeavoured to &s;tay this torrent of philo&s;ophy. Man only re|quires to be told his rights to know them. The young men copying the example of Doctor Alogos, were not to be bubbled out of a fee by the prie&s;ts, and the wives became what is vulgarly called lazy and &s;lovenly, but which in the language of re|fined philo&s;ophy, is independent, and &s;uperior to prejudice.</P>
<P>Things proceeded thus admirably in a pari&s;h, where, but a little time before, all had gone on in the old track, where contented and ignorant families depended on their own labour, and were &s;o proud of the childi&s;h title of Engli&s;hmen, that they de|te&s;ted a work-hou&s;e &s;o long as health and &s;trength remained. But now they &s;aw clearly, that, ac|cording to the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> every one had a ju&s;t demand for &s;upport from the community, after a certain age, and therefore to work for a rainy day was as ab&s;urd as it was old.</P>
<P>The poor rates multiplied &s;o fa&s;t upon tho&s;e who &s;till continued to &s;upport the Gothic prejudices of
<PB N="114" REF="038973_0125_101283C58FAE6B68">
their ance&s;tors, that &s;everal heretofore flouri&s;hing families were obliged to quit the pari&s;h, and their farms remained unoccupied.</P>
<P>Frederick, in the mean time, had endeavoured to cultivate the affections of Laura; but though he gained upon her heart, her head re&s;i&s;ted all the arguments of his philo&s;ophy. It was in vain he traduced the cu&s;tom of marriage; &s;he remained wedded to the blind principles in which &s;he had been educated. 'For,' &s;aid &s;he, 'were I to become your <HI>companion,</HI> or that of any other man, when I &s;hall perhaps be &s;urrounded with two or three chil|dren, a moment's di&s;gu&s;t may leave me without a partner. Till it is the fa&s;hion for men to maintain the children of others, no woman in her &s;en&s;es would permit the pa&s;&s;ion of a man unmarried, becau&s;e, though he could range and &s;elect another, &s;he mu&s;t remain forlorn and abandoned.'</P>
<P>'The &s;uppo&s;ition,' &s;aid Frederick, 'that I mu&s;t have a companion for life, is the re&s;ult of a com|plication of vices: It is the dictate of cowardice, and not of fortitude: It flows from a de&s;ire of being loved and e&s;teemed for &s;omething that is not de&s;ert. The in&s;titution of marriage is a <HI>&s;y&s;tem of fraud,</HI> and men who <HI>carefully mi&s;lead</HI> their judgments in the daily affairs of their life, will always have a crip|pled judgment in every other concern.&mdash;Marriage is law, and the <HI>wor&s;t of all laws.</HI> Whatever our under&s;tandings may tell us of the per&s;on from who&s;e connexion we &s;hould derive the greate&s;t improvement, of the worth of one woman, and the demerits of another, we are obliged to con&s;ider what is law, and not what is ju&s;tice. <HI>So long as I &s;eek to engro&s;s one woman to my&s;elf, and prohibit my neighbour from proving his &s;uperior de&s;erts, and reap|ing

<P>'Do you wi&s;h me,' &s;aid Laura, 'to &s;uppo&s;e you &s;peak &s;eriou&s;ly? You are dreaming, Frederick, or you are mad or wor&s;e. To &s;ay nothing of the <HI>moral</HI> turpitude of &s;uch infamous and <HI>brothel</HI> doc|trines, I &s;hould like to know if there is one &s;ingle republican in the kingdom, who, however he might wi&s;h to indulge <HI>him&s;elf</HI> in &s;uch licen&s;e, would per|mit his mother, his wife, his &s;i&s;ter, or his daugh|ter to live promi&s;cuou&s;ly like bea&s;ts of the field?'</P>
<P>'And are men not by nature brutes, as the mighty Rou&s;&s;eau has proved to a demon&s;tration?'</P>
<P>'Let us take it &s;o,' &s;aid Laura, with a &s;igh: 'what will be the re&s;ult? We &s;hould &s;ee half a dozen throats cut for a pretty woman, for then the law would be no check on licentious appetites. But, Sir, reflect <HI>if</HI> what I &s;ay be not true.

You would ca&s;t a&s;ide re&s;trains, becau&s;e you are too great ty|rants your&s;elves to &s;ubmit to the government of others; as, for in&s;tance, Doctor Alogos was one of the be&s;t tempered, humane men in the world, till he took to the&s;e whims from the lo&s;s of a law-&s;uit; and now, though he is always telling us we are &s;laves, and have as much right as the men to every freedom, yet, if every article in the hou&s;e, to the &s;malle&s;t trifle, is not in exact order, we hear noth|ing but execrations, which once he was afraid to utter.

of &s;ex do it merely to cover their own de|praved de&s;ires, and avoid the &s;tigma of the world by rendering it common.'</P>
<P>'I am very &s;orry,' &s;aid Frederick, 'that you argue as if you had never heard the great doctrines of philo&s;ophy. Had you heard my Mary on this &s;ubject! per&s;ua&s;ion hung upon her tongue, and the &s;elf-demon&s;trated axioms of moral &s;cience flow|ed from her lips. "It is difficult to recommend any thing to indi&s;criminate adoption, contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules and prejudices of mankind; but certainly nothing can be &s;o ridiculous upon the face of it, or &s;o contrary to the <HI>genuine march</HI> of &s;entiment, as to require the overflowing of the &s;oul to wait upon a ceremony, and that which, wherev|er delicacy and imagination exi&s;t, is of all things mo&s;t &s;acredly private, to blow <HI>a trumpet</HI> before it, and to record the moment when it has arrived at its climax<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Mrs. Wool&s;tonecraft Godwin.

<P>'Excellent!' cried Laura, breaking into a laugh; 'this is &s;heer bomba&s;t, and putting into hy|perbolic language what might have been &s;aid in &s;imple words. Can any thing be more <HI>impudent</HI> than for a woman to <HI>marry,</HI> becau&s;e by marrying &s;he tells the world that &s;he has conformed to its cu&s;toms in following the purpo&s;e of her creation? Whereas, if &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed all its rules, trampled down tho&s;e barriers to lu&s;t, mode&s;ty, and morality, and became a <HI>pro&s;titute,</HI> &s;he is <HI>mode&s;t</HI> in extreme, becau&s;e &s;he did not tell the world beforehand &s;he was going to be ruined.

<P>'There is no rea&s;oning with women,' cried Frederick, in a pet; 'they have no &s;ouls capable of receiving the new light of irradiating &s;cience, which is breaking through the mi&s;ts of &s;uper&s;tition and ignorance. How few are like my Mary, free in thought and in action! She was a wonderful wo|man, and de&s;pi&s;ed the je&s;ts of the world: &s;he knew, that in reality there was no difference of &s;ex in &s;ouls, but that education made women fools and idiots.'</P>
<P>'You have often,' &s;aid Laura,' talked to me in this &s;train; you have told me that women are no otherwi&s;e inferior to men than by education; but to me there appears an humbling difference.&mdash; Have they not to bear and bring children into the world? Are they not then tied down to the routine of a nur&s;ery? Are not all their employments nece&s;|&s;arily dome&s;tic? And does not nature &s;eem to have pointed to this end in the di&s;po&s;ition of their frame? &mdash;Men, in all countries, take upon them the ruder employments, and it is only an eccentric &s;oul that would wi&s;h, in the frenzy of imagination, to blend the &s;exes.'</P>
<P>'But women, with their pre&s;ent <HI>weakne&s;s of in|tellect,</HI> are not capable of teaching children their duties, and rational philo&s;ophy.'</P>
<P>'I will quote you a pa&s;&s;age,' &s;aid Laura, 'from a droll book at reveries my uncle lately bought, called the Rights of Women. In page 148, I believe you will find the&s;e words:&mdash;"The man|agement of the temper, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t impor|tant branch of education, requires the <HI>&s;ober, &s;teady

eye of rea&s;on:</HI> a plan of conduct equally di&s;tant from tyranny and indulgence. I have followed this train of rea&s;oning much further, till I have concluded that a <HI>per&s;on of genius is the mo&s;t improper per&s;on</HI> to be em|ployed in education, either private or public."</P>
<P>From this quotation we may infer two conclu|&s;ions: Fir&s;t, that a per&s;on of <HI>genius</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not the <HI>&s;teady, &s;ober eye of rea&s;on,</HI> and therefore all your pretended philo&s;ophers, reformers, and men of pro|found genius, have not one jot of rea&s;on, con&s;e|quently are <HI>fools.</HI> Secondly, allowing women to he pretty idiots, they are the mo&s;t proper to give education, and the le&s;s genius they po&s;&s;e&s;s, the greater is their qualification: and indeed I might draw a third inference, that per&s;ons writing pal|pable contradictions are unworthy notice on either &s;ide.'</P>
<P>'Oh!' cried Frederick, 'were the great Stupeo here, he would bring arguments that would incon|trovertibly prove&mdash;'</P>
<P>'Prove what?' &s;aid Laura: 'prove him&s;elf a greater fool than his pupil.'</P>
<P>'No,' cried Frederick, 'prove that you are the charminge&s;t pretty idiot in the world.'</P>
<P>Thus the great copyi&s;t of one of the greate&s;t phi|lo&s;ophers that have glittered in the eighteenth cen|tury, de&s;cended from the pinnacle of intellect to tell a girl what her gla&s;s told her every morning. But, as Voltaire has admirably proved, by a few arguments in about a hundred different places, and Ro&s;&s;eau demon&s;trated by practice with the idiot Tere&s;a, it is a fact, that great heroes, great poets, great philo&s;ophers, metaphy&s;icians, and ballad-mak|ers, have all become fools to plea&s;e fooli&s;h women.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. Rea&s;ons for peopling the world&mdash;&s;pecimen of the Sublime&mdash; the con&s;olations of Philo&s;ophy in Di&s;appointment&mdash;the immutability of Truth.</HEAD>
<P>FREDERICK was di&s;compo&s;ed beyond the dignity of a philo&s;opher at the perver&s;ene&s;s of Lau|ra: he began almo&s;t to think that women were be|ings made expre&s;sly for the plea&s;ures of men, a gild|ed toy, which a great metaphy&s;ician and philo&s;o|pher might conde&s;cend to play with when he quitted the Hall of Contemplation, and ventured from the paths of intellectual rambling to the gro&s;s pavement of life.</P>
<P>His mind was perpetually bent upon the great work of reformation, and the perfection of juri&s;|prudence, <HI>except</HI> when he mu&s;ed upon the pretty lip of Laura, which frequently dimpled with an inimi|table &s;mile, and that &s;mile was not the vacant &s;mile of childi&s;hne&s;s&mdash;it was a &s;mile of meaning, expre&s;s|ive of &s;ome fine &s;en&s;ation of mind, brightening the whole countenance, and lightening the eye with the intelligence of good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>'I know not,' &s;aid he to him&s;elf, as he rambled over the fields, 'what to make of this girl; &s;he rea|&s;ons as if &s;he had rea&s;on, but it is quite in the old &s;tyle. What is this love? What would my dear Stu|peo define it? A pa&s;&s;ion, that, like an optic gla&s;s, inverts its object. Ah! now I am &s;atisfied &s;he does not in reality po&s;&s;e&s;s any good quality: it is my pa&s;|&s;ion which deceives me, and &s;he is no more an angel than the re&s;t of her &s;ex. All her virtues are only
<PB N="120" REF="038973_0131_101283D5B941CA88">
like colours in objects, merely rays pre&s;&s;ed in dif|ferent angles upon the eye. She her&s;elf is a blank, a mere white &s;heet of paper, and it remains for me to &s;tamp upon her any character I plea&s;e. As to beauty&mdash;what is beauty? A&s;k a negro of Guinea what is beauty, the &s;upremely beautiful, the <GAP DESC="foreign"> (to kalon,) he will an&s;wer you a grea&s;y black &s;kin, hollow eyes, and a flat no&s;e. Con&s;ult the philo&s;ophers, they will tell you &s;ome unintelligi|ble jargon for an&s;wer&mdash;they mu&s;t have &s;omething corre&s;pondent to beauty in the ab&s;tract.'</P>
<P>Having thus u&s;ed the light of human rea&s;on in rational argument, Frederick determined that Laura mu&s;t and &s;hould be his, not for his own &s;ake, but for the promotion of freedom, and the <HI>&s;pread of the truth.</HI></P>
<P>'It is the univer&s;al good and greate&s;t re&s;ulting benefit we are ever to have in view,' continued he: 'all the great men of the eighteenth century tell us we mu&s;t not regard any contingencies, the&s;e be|ing only partial and unavoidable evils. It is plain the world mu&s;t be peopled; for if it is not peopled, we philo&s;ophers would have nobody to revolutionize, and rea&s;on and logic, and ignorance, would be tan|tamount to the &s;ame. This then is the &s;elf-demon|&s;trated hypothe&s;is: this then is the grand ba&s;is to build upon; and as all things depend upon peopling the world, it follows, that to people the world is the mo&s;t meritorious action of life. But how am I to con|tribute to this greate&s;t good, if Laura per&s;i&s;ts in her notions of matrimony? It is impo&s;&s;ible. I &s;hould then &s;urrender my freedom, and freedom is even a <HI>great|er</HI> good <HI>than life</HI> it&s;elf. Some middle way mu&s;t be devi&s;ed; and though I abhor giving pain to any creature under the heavens, yet I mu&s;t not be de|terred from peopling the world, by the tears, faint|ings,
<PB N="121" REF="038973_0132_101283DA0F74D920">
and frettings of a woman who even does not know the great maxims of philo&s;ophy. What are tears? mere bubbles of water emitted from a par|ticular &s;timulus of the nerves of the eye: Women have weaker nerves than men, therefore tears from them are more common. As to fainting, that al&s;o depends on weak nerves:&mdash;Some will faint at the &s;ight of a rat. Well, I cannot help the irritability of the nervous &s;y&s;tem:&mdash;A charming idea indeed! that, becau&s;e women have weak nerves, the world is not to be peopled! Be&s;ides, am I not a philo&s;o|pher? Yes: I have, and I will ri&s;e far above hu|man nature. Have I not &s;educed the mi&s;tre&s;s of my friend? Have I not been the means of a pretty girl and her father peri&s;hing in the flames? Have I not led a mob to burn down the metropolis of Great Britain? Have I not induced a wife to betray her hu&s;band, which cau&s;ed his own and his children's death? Have I not lo&s;t three teeth and half my lit|tle finger in the cau&s;e of liberty? Have I not mur|dered my own mother? And &s;hall the tears and lamentings of a girl prevent my marching forward in the high road of all-irradiating &s;cience, and peo|pling the world?</P>
<P>'O Philo&s;ophy! how few can contemplate thy &s;ublime and terrific features: Thy feet &s;tand upon the poles of the world&mdash;thy head is cinctured round with nubilated exhalations, who&s;e volcanic entrails emit thunderings and lightenings that &s;catter all ex|i&s;tence around thee, and hecatombs of infidels and &s;urdous men are reared or di&s;per&s;ed by the cata|cly&s;ms of thy &s;cientific fulminations. When &s;hall the catenas of mankind be decrepitated by the furnace of truth, ignited by the bellows of rea&s;on? When &s;hall the ingannations of prejudice be delacerated, and the catachre&s;tical rea&s;onings of facinorous ari&s;|tocrats

<P>From this prodigious flight of the true &s;ublime and unintelligible, Frederick &s;uddenly de&s;cended to the con&s;ideration of more common action: &s;imply, how he might promote the increa&s;e of mankind. It appeared no very ea&s;y ta&s;k to do away the qualms of con&s;cience in a mode&s;t girl, unle&s;s indeed he could prove to her that there was no &s;uch thing as con|&s;cience, which was a ta&s;k of no great difficulty for a modern philo&s;opher to undertake. Another &s;mall reflection occupied him, for he &s;aw that he mu&s;t proceed upon the principles of deception, and what then became of immutable truth? But on weighing over the maxims of <HI>political ju&s;tice,</HI> he found that deception was extremely moral in affairs of love, and he was more than ever enamoured of the new philo&s;ophy, which &s;eemed calculated for the com|fort of man.</P>
<P>He began with Doctor Alogos, whom he &s;oon convinced of the non-entity of con&s;cience; that rea&s;on was the only guide to truth, and pa&s;&s;ion the index to plea&s;ure. Laura, the blind prejudiced Laura, was not to be wrought upon by the pro|foundne&s;s of his rea&s;onings and the &s;ubtilty of his logic.&mdash;'Though I feel my&s;elf unequal to an&s;wer you,' &s;aid &s;he, 'that by no means is an approval of your arguments; for I well know that by argument we can neither prove nor refute many things which yet we feel to be or not to be. For in&s;tance, you may tell me I am ten feet or only ten inches high; that my &s;ight deceives me; and you may confound me with arguments to prove your a&s;&s;ertion. But all tho&s;e arguments will not change my opinion that I am only five feet high, nor will you per&s;uade me that I have no con&s;cience.'</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="038973_0134_101283DE88A8A8D8">One fine glowing evening, when the country was yellowed over with harve&s;t, and the birds chirped among&s;t the hedges, which were hung with &s;talks of loo&s;e corn, Frederick and Laura took a walk to &s;ome di&s;tance, and, as it is very natural, di&s;cour&s;ed on love by the way.</P>
<P>Frederick exerted all his eloquence upon the u&s;ual &s;ubject; but &s;eeing that he made no impre&s;&s;ion, he <HI>tran&s;ided</HI> into the more natural language of com|mon-place, &s;uch as has been the practice of all lovers &s;ince the flood, and &s;uch as will continue to win the hearts of the fair, till philo&s;ophy &s;hall introduce a new &s;et of ideas and &s;en&s;ations.&mdash;'I will,' &s;aid he, 'char|ming Laura, adopt your &s;ide of the que&s;tion, for re|ally metaphy&s;ics do not altogether &s;atisfy the heart.'</P>
<P>'Were you to for&s;ake your wild opinions,' &s;aid Laura, 'you would become an agreeable member of &s;ociety.'</P>
<P>'It is you,' he replied, 'who mu&s;t make, me &s;o; it is you I &s;hall look up to for in&s;truction; but re|member the &s;entiments of Rou&s;&s;eau in his Emilius. If woman be formed to plea&s;e, and be &s;ubjected to man, it is her place doubtle&s;s to render her&s;elf agree|able to him in&s;tead of challenging his pa&s;&s;ion: the violence of his de&s;ires depends upon her charms; it is by means of the&s;e &s;he &s;hould urge him to the ex|ertion of tho&s;e powers nature has given him. The mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful method of exciting is to render &s;uch exertion nece&s;&s;ary by re&s;i&s;tance, as in that ca&s;e &s;elf|love is added to de&s;ire, and the one triumphs in the victory which the other is obliged to acquire.'</P>
<P>'The&s;e &s;entiments were worthy a voluptuary,' replied Laura: 'they came, no doubt, warm from the heart of Rou&s;&s;eau.'</P>
<P>'Yes,' &s;aid Frederick, 'from the author of Eloi&s;a we &s;hould expect &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions, but they are neverthele&s;s true. You have read, Laura,
<PB N="124" REF="038973_0135_101283E2CAB35D58">
that charming romance. What did you feel at the <HI>fir&s;t ki&s;s of love?</HI> In a word, did not the whole per|formance &s;et your &s;oul on fire?'</P>
<P>'No,' replied Laura; 'I &s;aw through the &s;o|phi&s;tical jargon of rhap&s;odic language. I beheld only a man who kept a milliner, endeavouring to ju&s;tify his actions to the world by drawing a fiery picture totally untrue. Do you think there is a man in the world like Wolmar? And what was St. Preux but a precious &s;entimental ra&s;cal, who, un|der the &s;anction of the mo&s;t &s;acred friend&s;hip, plunders, a believing love-&s;ick girl, and talks all the while about virtue and cele&s;tial innocence?'</P>
<P>Frederick found by this di&s;cour&s;e that he &s;hould not ea&s;ily contaminate the purity of her mind by the introduction of voluptuous &s;ubjects, for he knew of no book more likely to introduce a de&s;ire of di&s;&s;i|pation than the celebrated Eloi&s;a of Rou&s;&s;eau:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To this may now be added the Monk.</NOTE> he therefore re&s;olved to &s;upply his want of per&s;ua|&s;ion by violence, beginning with tho&s;e liberties of|ten allowed, till his pa&s;&s;ions throwing him off his guard, he exerted that prowe&s;s which men are en|dowed with for other purpo&s;es; but here he was again deceived, Laura not being one of tho&s;e puny &s;lips of fa&s;hion which &s;hrink from the touch.</P>
<P>The philo&s;opher was confounded at a re&s;i&s;tance he had not expected from the delicate figure of the maid. He hung down his head in &s;ilent <HI>vexation</HI> at her keen reproaches; for <HI>&s;hame</HI> he knew not, unle&s;s it was in &s;topping &s;hort of his heroic and pa|triotic intentions. He propo&s;ed, in a tone of voice much beneath the dignity of manhood to accom|pany her home, but &s;he refu&s;ed his offer with &s;u|perlative di&s;dain.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="038973_0136_101283E5AD816230">He turned away to philo&s;ophi&s;e, and call to his aid the doctrines of Stupeo: &s;o chagrined was he at the di&s;appointment, that he almo&s;t re&s;olved never again to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before Doctor Alogos&mdash; but again he reflected, that it was unworthy a great man to &s;toop to accidents, it being more in the order of Nature that accidents &s;hould bend to them.</P>
<P>As he walked forward, wrapped in <HI>mu&s;ing me|lancholy,</HI> a gleam of &s;atisfaction darted acro&s;s his mind&mdash;'Why' &s;aid he, internally, 'am I &s;o griev|ed at a trifling di&s;appointment:&mdash;I, who am a be|ing independent of the Univer&s;e, in how few years will age de&s;troy the appetite for plea&s;ure, and I &s;hall then regret not having made more advantage of the fleeting moments. Did I bow down to the idols of prie&s;tcraft, I might be deterred from many ac|tions called <HI>crimes,</HI> by the dread of future puni&s;h|ment; but it is the height of monki&s;h blindne&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e there is any &s;uch thing as future puni&s;hment, and I am per&s;uaded, I am certain, half mankind do not give credit to &s;uch &s;hocking doctrines, or it would be impo&s;&s;ible they could act as they do.&mdash; What lawyer would undertake a wrong cau&s;e? What guardian would ruin the orphan under his care? What wife would betray her hu&s;band? What &s;on would di&s;obey his father? What father would ruin his family with variety of exce&s;s? And what young man would, for the plea&s;ure of half an hour, cajole, with fal&s;e oaths and profe&s;&s;ions, a fair, be|lieving-tender-hearted girl into a mi&s;ery that can end only with her life?&mdash;No; I am certain, if peo|ple believed any thing of revealed religion, none of this could happen. Then &s;hall I be trammelled by &s;uch con&s;iderations? O Philo&s;ophy! divine light of the &s;oul I thy con&s;olations never fail in the hour of

<P>Having thus confirmed his mind in the&s;e delecta|ble principles, he felt re-a&s;&s;ured to his purpo&s;e, and inclined his thoughts to &s;ugge&s;t the means of &s;ubdu|ing Laura.</P>
<P>Laura informed her uncle of the great de&s;igns of the vagabond Philo&s;opher; but that di&s;ciple of the new &s;chool only cooly bid her be cautious, for no|thing in nature could be more natural.</P>
<P>Frederick was &s;urpri&s;ed to find the Doctor in good &s;pirits; and no hint being dropped concerning his recent attempt, he already concluded Laura in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He retired early to bed to dige&s;t his plan; and not being, able to &s;leep, he tumbled a|bout till midnight, when he was alarmed with a grating noi&s;e at the window beneath him. He li&s;|tened, and fancying he heard foot&s;teps, aro&s;e, and was proceeding down &s;tairs with a poker in his hand, when two men a&s;cending, pre&s;ented pi&s;tols at him, with threats of in&s;tant death, if he alarmed the hou&s;e.</P>

'we may conceal the truth becau&s;e it is an allowa|ble deception to deceive a girl to her own benefit, and the augmentation of mankind. But, for the &s;ake of wealth, dro&s;s, tra&s;h, rubbi&s;h&mdash;'</P>

<P>Frederick, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, would have been confu&s;ed if he had not been a very great man: but he was arrived at &s;o much perfection, that he could li&s;ten to his own prai&s;e in the moment he wi&s;hed to perpetrate what with half mankind would have ren|dered him an object of dete&s;tation; but this attain|ment could only be acquired by a &s;teady attention to all the enlightened doctrines of the eighteenth century, and is called the bold, unblu&s;hing front of manly truth.</P>
<P>Laura rejoiced at the e&s;cape of her uncle, for her bo&s;om was only too &s;u&s;ceptible of gratitude, and &s;he almo&s;t forgave the attack upon her&s;elf.

<P>THE harmony of the family once more re&s;tor|ed, the public good became again their chief care, but an accident happened that very much checked their proceedings. A countryman had been detect|ed offering one of the notes which had been &s;tolen, and was carried before a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, where he was identified by Frederick and the Doctor.&mdash; He pleaded very much in his own favour, prote&s;ting that it was his fir&s;t crime, and that his accomplice had carried away the whole booty except that &s;ingle note.</P>

<P>'Doctrines like the&s;e,' &s;aid the Ju&s;tice, 'are certainly of the mo&s;t pernicious tendency, and, in fact, Doctor Alogos, this man appears to me le&s;s guilty than your&s;elf.

<P>The attention of the numerous company a&s;&s;em|bled was arre&s;ted by the approach of a crowd of peo|ple.

<P>The &s;urgeon frequently lamented the nece&s;&s;ity there was for this barbarous practice, as he called it. &mdash;'Were we allowed,' &s;aid he, 'all unclaimed bodies which die in ho&s;pitals, all malefactors, of every de&s;|cription, and all &s;uicides, we &s;hould not need to di&s;|turb the repo&s;e of &s;acred bodies, who&s;e place af|fection laments and vi&s;its, when perhaps they have been mangled to pieces in our lecture-room, or &s;old piecemeal, at fixed prices, like butchers' meat, to any per&s;on.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a known fact, that every part of the human body has a regular price.

<P>My practice of plundering the church-yards at the mo&s;t &s;olemn hours, under danger of detection, and what was wor&s;e, under the fear of infection from di&s;ea&s;es nearly advanced to putre&s;cence before the interment; to break open a coffin, and carry in my arms a naked body, who&s;e &s;cent was &s;ufficient to ferment a plague, was an undertaking that re|quired all the re&s;olution of philo&s;ophy, and fitted me for the event of any revolution or combu&s;tion of nature.</P>
<P>One day I ob&s;erved to Dr. Cuticle, that it was to me a plain demon&s;tration from the &s;tructure of the animal oeconomy, and its tendency to putre&s;cence, that it was like every other material &s;ub&s;tance; that the derangement of any one part affecting an imma|terial, impalpable &s;omething, called the &s;oul, was a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bigotry; for, were the &s;oul an immortal &s;pirit, it

<P>'Place a man in perfect health in a circular room, glazed round, &s;ome of the windows &s;hall be green, &s;ome red, and &s;ome blue: you will grant that in looking through the&s;e windows he will &s;ee ob|jects of different colours and &s;hades, but yet his own &s;ight &s;hall be clear and perfect.

<P>THE following day, Frederick, in the garden, informed his tutor with his pa&s;&s;ion for Laura; that he debated with him&s;elf as to the re&s;ulting good, and found a &s;ort of he&s;itation to u&s;e her with too much violence.</P>
<P>'I will let you into a my&s;tery,' &s;aid Stupeo. 'The great ma&s;s of mankind are fools, and no better than the callous &s;od on which we tread. It is the part of the great men and philo&s;ophers to mould them as they plea&s;e; and when we have &s;haken off the in|fluence of every thing called principle, are &s;atisfied we have no portion in eternity, and that the fable of an avenging Deity is an old woman's tale, what

<P>'I feel,' cried Frederick, 'I feel I am now free. &mdash;I &s;hall render my name immortal, for no human tie&mdash;no moral check &s;hall &s;tay the purpo&s;e of my power. But it &s;eems true, after all, that a &s;ociety of athei&s;ts could not exi&s;t, they would murder and be murdered: no tru&s;t could be placed upon any man; the king would a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the man who af|fronted him; the courtier would a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the man who oppo&s;ed him; the wife would a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate her hu&s;band, when di&s;appointed in meeting her lover; no girl would arrive at the age of maturity; and the human &s;pecies would &s;oon become extinct.'</P>
<P>'And what then?' &s;aid Stupeo. 'The &s;ame &s;pirit which now actuates our bodies&punc; mu&s;t then actuate &s;omething el&s;e:&mdash;you cannot annihilate that &s;ubtle gas; and if it does not give motion to men, it may to &s;ome new &s;pecies:&mdash;who knows but it may animate the trees and plants with rational facul|ties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let the reader reflect upon this.

but here comes Laura and the Doctor. We have been di&s;cour&s;ing,' continued he, 'on matter and &s;pirit, and it appears plain that matter is eternal, and &s;pirit mere fermentation.'</P>
<P>'I wonder,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'how our world was &s;o admirably formed, unle&s;s it was by the power of an omnipotent Being.'</P>
<P>'Our earth,' cried Stupeo, 'was once a part of the &s;un, a molten ma&s;s, when a large comet bru&s;h|ing too near that luminary, da&s;hed off a con&s;idera|ble portion, which flew till the natural motion form|ed it into a &s;pheroid, and it began to cool. The at|mo&s;phere round it formed the ocean, and the fric|tion of this va&s;t body of waters upon the &s;coria and cinders, which compo&s;ed the great &s;keleton of the world, formed the &s;ands of the &s;ea, which &s;ub|&s;ided into large beds, ri&s;ing by degrees to the &s;ur|face, where the action of the &s;un hardened the &s;u|perfices. The heat of this luminary upon the pu|trid particles of the &s;ea generated &s;hell-fi&s;h, which are evidently mo&s;t allied to &s;tone of any animal we know. The&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole of the ocean for &s;ome thou&s;and ages, and being by the gravita|tion of the earth, thrown into large chains of beds, in the progre&s;s of time decaying and cementing to|gether with the olaginous-&s;ub&s;tance they contained&punc; the &s;hells became &s;tones, forming mountains.&mdash; Thus we always find &s;hells in every body of rock, and on the highe&s;t mountains. Every great change produced a revolution, and from the &s;oft <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lime of &s;helly mountains, vegetables were produced.&mdash;This new form of matter decaying and fermenting, ani|mals, &s;uch as lyons, tygers, bulls and monkeys, were produced. The latter was man in his original &s;tate. It was &s;ome thou&s;and years before he learnt to walk upon his hind legs, &s;ome thou&s;and more before he pull|ed off his &s;haggy coating; but it is not material for me to trace him in every improvement, till he ac|quired

a full face from the effects of a change of cli|mate, and learnt the articulation of &s;ounds by imi|tating the babbling of a brook, for he is to this day a creature imitating every other animal, and nothing is more clear than that he was originally an Ouran-outang.'</P>
<P>'It &s;trikes me,' &s;aid Laura, 'that your &s;y&s;tem is a little prepo&s;terous; and one is led to inquire where you &s;tood when the earth was a liquid &s;tream of melting fire? But, with regard to man, I would ob&s;erve, that had he <HI>ever</HI> been a mere brute ani|mal, he <HI>never</HI> would have changed his nature; he never could have acquired perfectability, for we never &s;ee the lea&s;t progre&s;&s;ion in animals, nor are monkeys, at this period, one &s;ingle degree advanc|ed beyond what they were three thou&s;and years ago; but, neverthele&s;s,' &s;aid &s;he, with a look of irony, 'when one &s;ees &s;ome people, they are apt to acknowledge the relation&s;hip, and when they hear the chatter of jingling, unmeaning &s;entences, they are apt to cry out, that the Ouran-outang is the better man.'</P>
<P>Stupeo could not but feel this &s;ally, but it was beneath his philo&s;ophical metaphy&s;ical dignity to re|gard, or even reply to this rea&s;oning of a woman, who was not illuminated with the &s;plendid rays of intellect.</P>
<P>Frederick often &s;ought an opportunity to accom|pli&s;h his &s;chemes, but &s;ought in vain, the vigilance of Laura precluding a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s. He more than once attempted to infu&s;e a drug into her drink; but whether &s;he &s;u&s;pected him or no, &s;he al|ways avoided any thing from his hands which would admit adulteration.</P>
<P>Peace was about this time e&s;tabli&s;hed with Amer|ica, and the whole country rang with exultation. &mdash;During the war, no one had more execrated the &s;y&s;tem than the Doctor, and every lecture conclud|ed
<PB N="149" REF="038973_0160_1012842FFB086958">
with an apo&s;trophe to peace. He now mounted the pulpit in the Hall of Science, (the name of the lecture barn) and to prove that he was a very great philo&s;opher could find fault with every thing, and was &s;taunch at all times and all &s;ea&s;ons again&s;t gov|ernment. He declared that the peace was the mo&s;t di&s;graceful that could po&s;&s;ibly be made; that it would not continue a twelvemonth before we &s;hould be driven from Canada. He declared, that, like Milton's devils, mankind were only born for re|bellion and revolution, that all their joy was to riot in de&s;truction, murder, and violation.</P>
<P>A number of &s;oldiers who were returning to their families, hearing the&s;e great truths, &s;wore the Doctor was in&s;ulting them. A &s;ailor, with one leg, threw a crab cudgel at the head of the Doctor, which narrowly e&s;caped him. Frederick leaped upon a bench, vociferating, 'Citizens! the cau&s;e of all mankind is involved in this di&s;pute: we ought to know whether the&s;e vagabonds are to in&s;ult us in our halls, and in our temples. Truth is &s;acred, and I will &s;peak it, though a legion of &s;pies were around me.'</P>
<P>'Citizens!' roared out Stupeo, 'you are under military government; the Phili&s;tines are upon us; the freedom of &s;peech has departed, and you are all &s;laves bound in chains, and riveted by your own &s;u|pinene&s;s.'</P>
<P>Anarchy and confu&s;ion now reigned in the Hall. The benches were broken in pieces and &s;erved for clubs. A de&s;perate battle en&s;ued, as &s;ome few of the country people &s;tood by the Doctor; but they were &s;oon completely drubbed, and fled in different routes. Doctor Alogos and his two companions found a temporary &s;helter in the man&s;ion, and to their a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;aw their principal hearers the mo&s;t violent.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="038973_0161_101284319D416140">'What &s;hall be done?' cried the Doctor, trem|bling mo&s;t philo&s;ophically: 'This enraged bea&s;t, this many-headed mon&s;ter will devour us.'</P>
<P>'Reverence the divine maje&s;ty of a mob,' cried Stupeo; 'all their motions po&s;&s;e&s;s energy, and all their actions ju&s;tice. This is a mere momentary fermentation, the efferve&s;cence of popular frenzy&punc; and will &s;ub&s;ide into a delightful calm.'</P>
<P>'But what are we to do in the mean time? We &s;hall be murdered!'</P>
<P>'A mere trifle, my dear Doctor:&mdash;a mere re|modification of matter.'</P>
<P>'A remodification of the devil: I don't at all like this.'</P>
<P>'It is a d&mdash;d ari&s;tocratical church-and-king mob,' cried Frederick. 'I have been to talk to them, but they are deaf to the voice of rea&s;on; they are increa&s;ed by a number of market-women, who vow vengeance again&s;t Stupeo for his three wives, and the Doctor for his kept mi&s;tre&s;s. This is no repub|lican mob, in&s;pired with the divine frenzy of liberty and equality.'</P>
<P>'Oh! cur&s;e it,' cried Doctor Alogos, 'they &s;eem to have liberty enough; they are treading down my fine flower-garden like an herd of &s;wine; there go all my exotic &s;hrubs!&mdash;I believe they are a troop of Goths and Vandals, who pay no regard to &s;cience.'</P>
<P>'There is your whole congregation!' cried Laura, weeping. 'My dear uncle, they are all gone mad; they are talking about rights and li|berties, and de&s;troying every thing before them.'</P>
<P>'Let us defend our&s;elves,' cried Frederick, run|ning to the front window. 'Citizens!' cried he, 'is it thus you abu&s;e your friends?'</P>
<P>'Friends!' &s;houted a countryman, 'there be no &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h thing as friend&s;hip. Equality for ever!&mdash;
<PB N="151" REF="038973_0162_1012843335732AA0">
and down with the Doctor!' Frederick immediate|ly fired a fowling-piece, loaded with &s;mall &s;hot. A volley of &s;tones was returned, which broke half the windows in front, and da&s;hed out one of the orator's teeth. Stupeo in&s;tantly advanced, with a blunder|bu&s;s, which he fired, and checked the fury of the mob for an in&s;tant; but the &s;oldiers leading the at|tack &s;wore they would murder man, woman and child, and burn the hou&s;e to the ground.</P>
<P>Not a moment was to be lo&s;t in this ca&s;e of ex|treme nece&s;&s;ity; and Frederick even debated whe|ther the re&s;ulting good did not require him to join the mob, and aid them in the de&s;truction of proper|ty. All the Doctor's cabinet of natural hi&s;tory was de&s;troyed; his fine library made a bon-fire, and his elegant man&s;ion was reduced to a&s;hes, amid&s;t the &s;houts of liberty and equality.</P>
<P>The fugitives found &s;helter in the hou&s;e of a neighbouring gentleman, who &s;aved them from the madne&s;s of the mob. 'For me,' cried Frederick, 'I am determined not to remain another week in this vile i&s;land, where there is not one &s;ingle &s;park of liberty and national &s;pirit remaining.'</P>
<P>'What do you call this?' demanded the Doctor: 'I think it is liberty &s;ufficient to burn a man's hou&s;e about his ears.'</P>
<P>'But that mu&s;t have been a mob hired by the go|vernment,' &s;aid Stupeo: 'had it been a republican mob, it would have been a different thing; we &s;hould then have had a fine di&s;play of rational prin|ciples.'</P>
<P>'All mobs,' &s;aid the gentleman, 'are alike, what|ever name you may give them. Mi&s;chief is their only de&s;ire&mdash;plunder the only object. To their lead|ers they are a &s;ubject of perpetual dread. For my part, I would rather live under a Turki&s;h Ba&s;haw,
<PB N="152" REF="038973_0163_10128434EAAAB2F0">
or in a country under martial law, than in a revo|lutionary country governed by mobs.'</P>
<P>'For this rea&s;on,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'you are a man of <HI>property,</HI> but for a man without any property, the latter is preferable, as it renders, in a &s;ummary way, the accumulations of wealth.'</P>
<P>'But then,' an&s;wered the gentleman, 'you are not one moment &s;ure of your plunder; a &s;tronger man may tear it from you, and, like a worm caught by a chicken, the whole flock will in turn catch it from each other, till it is either pulled in pieces, or gulphed down by &s;ome one at the hazard of choak|ing.'</P>
<P>'But that has nothing to do with liberty,' cried Frederick. 'All riches, and e&s;pecially hereditary riches, are to be con&s;idered as the &s;alary of a &s;inecure office, where the labourer and the manufacturer perform the duties, and the principal &s;pends the in|come in luxury and idlene&s;s. Hereditary wealth is in reality a premium paid to idlene&s;s, an immen&s;e annuity expended to retain mankind in <HI>brutality</HI> and ignorance, by the want of lei&s;ure (or time to be idle.) The <HI>rich</HI> are furni&s;hed indeed with the means of cultivation and literature, but they are paid for being di&s;&s;ipated and indolent. The mo&s;t powerful means that malignity could have invented, are em|ployed to prevent them from improving their tal|ents, and becoming u&s;eful to the public.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Godwin's Political Ju&s;tice, page 804.</NOTE>'</P>
<P>'You have made a very long &s;peech,' &s;aid the gen|tleman, 'on a very &s;hort &s;ubject: All you have &s;aid amounting to this, that the poor are ignorant, becau&s;e they have not lei&s;ure to be idle, and the rich are ig|norant, becau&s;e they are paid to be idle; &s;o that, in fact, all real knowledge centres in your&s;elf; and I have very little doubt, but, in your eyes, all the re&s;t
<PB N="153" REF="038973_0164_1012843D49192D88">
of mankind are little more than ideas, or at be&s;t ma|chines.'</P>
<P>'I will prove it by a demon&s;trable argument,' cried Stupeo.</P>
<P>'They are very de&s;tructive&punc; ideas then,' &s;aid Doctor Alogos. 'To &s;ay the truth, I am become quite &s;ick of &s;ociety, and all human nature togeth|er. I will go and bury my&s;elf in the wilderne&s;s of America, where no mob will burn my hou&s;e and de&s;troy my library.'</P>
<P>'Oh!' cried Frederick, 'there the people are free;&mdash;there the &s;pirit of truth &s;ought with irre&s;i&s;|tible energy: republicans always fight with double ardour.'</P>
<P>'Enthu&s;ia&s;m,' &s;aid the gentleman, 'is no proof of either truth or ju&s;tice; but it is certain to in&s;pire a de&s;perate &s;pirit in tho&s;e who feel it, let the cau&s;e be liberty, religion, rebellion, revenge, plunder, or what not; though it is very well to a&s;cribe to the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e what in fact is only due to the intoxicating enthu&s;ia&s;m of attaining a point&mdash; Revenge in general in&s;pires revolutions. The people feel the evils they &s;uffer under; they forget that a change mo&s;t probably will be for the wor&s;e; and to be revenged on one &s;et of men, they become &s;laves of another. I believe there never yet hap|pened a revolution, where the then living genera|tion did not feel accumulated ill, and the benefit to the next is very doubtful. Time, and the natural improvement of the human mind, gradually intro|duces reform, and in our own con&s;titution we find always &s;ome trifle to improve; and it is well known, that at this moment we enjoy more <HI>real liberty than any of our ance&s;tors;</HI> for in the days, called the gold|en days of good Queen Be&s;s, did not &s;he grant &s;o many monopoli&s;ing patents, that a gentleman de|manded

in the hou&s;e, if there was not going to be a patent for &s;elling bread.'</P>
<P>The next day the Doctor began to arrange his plans of emigration, procuring all the information he could of that delectable country, where poor peo|ple live better than the rich; where provi&s;ions are &s;o plentiful, you have money to take them away; where more is paid to mechanics for their labour than the articles &s;ell for; where there are no taxes, and where the travellers <HI>bundle</HI> with the daughters of the family.</P>
<P>Frederick felt his enthu&s;ia&s;m ri&s;e at this de&s;crip|tion, and determined to accompany the Doctor to Philadelphia, one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t regular ci|ties in the world.&mdash;'It is there,' &s;aid he, 'we &s;hall begin to breathe on the broad ba&s;is of truth and rea&s;on; there all the puerile di&s;tinctions of religion and country are unknown, and man is re&s;pected for his good qualities.'</P>
<P>Laura rai&s;ed many objections to the &s;cheme, and Su&s;an ab&s;olutely, refu&s;ed to tru&s;t her&s;elf in a foreign country without being married. Thus the Doctor was under a philo&s;ophical nece&s;&s;ity of complying with a &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;tom; and he could not re|frain ob&s;erving, that if he would have &s;ubmitted to matrimony before, he might have married a lady of education and fortune, and not an ignorant pert baggage, who a&s;&s;umed the airs of a lady, without the qualifications.</P>
<P>The e&s;tate and ruins of the man&s;ion being &s;old, the Doctor determined to &s;et out without putting in his claim to the damages he could demand from the county.</P>
<P>Frederick for a while &s;u&s;pended his de&s;igns up|on Laura, fore&s;eeing, that when they &s;hould be &s;ettled in a wilderne&s;s, &s;he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be ei|ther

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV. Reflections in a &s;torm&mdash;the delights of Philadelphia&mdash; the Doctor purcha&s;es a large e&s;tate in Kentucky.</HEAD>
<P>A PLEASANT gale wa&s;ted the&s;e adventurers from the dete&s;table i&s;land, where every thing was conducted in the wor&s;e manner po&s;&s;ible, and where law and religion influenced the majority of men. Their hopes were high, and they di&s;cour&s;ed and di&s;puted with true metaphy&s;ical ardour. The re&s;t of the pa&s;&s;engers were mechanics and countrymen, going over to make their fortunes, and the prai&s;es of America bounded from one mouth to another.</P>
<P>'I am a&s;toni&s;hed,' &s;aid a man who had &s;old a very good trade to emigrate, 'I am a&s;toni&s;hed that any man remains in Europe, when all the ble&s;&s;ings of life await him in America. I am going to pur|cha&s;e &s;ome lots of ground in the great city of Wa&s;h|ington, which will &s;hortly be the mo&s;t magnificent in the world. All the hou&s;es will be poli&s;hed free|&s;tone, the mo&s;t narrow &s;treets will be as wide a Port|land Place in London. Ships already arrive there, and the city will be the emporium of commerce: I under&s;tand that it already makes a noble appearance.'</P>
<P>'A very noble appearance indeed,' &s;aid the Cap|tain: 'the &s;treets are all laid out in right angles, upon paper. The number of workmen and me|chanics employed in building this magnificent city is truly a&s;toni&s;hing, they amount to nearly one
<PB N="156" REF="038973_0167_101284421EDAB650">
hundred and fifty. But the chief advantage attend|ing this city is, that it is contiguous to the e&s;tate of the Pre&s;ident.'</P>
<P>'You &s;peak,' &s;aid the pa&s;&s;enger, 'as if you were an Engli&s;hman, and wi&s;hed to di&s;courage new &s;et|tlers. I &s;uppo&s;e you are jealous of others partaking in the plea&s;ures of your country.'</P>
<P>'Very far from it,' &s;aid the Captain. 'I am amu&s;ed with the golden dreams of emigrants, who expect to find &s;ilver crows in America; and I can a&s;&s;ure you what I tell you of Wa&s;hington is literally true, and more than that, it never will be fini&s;hed, on account of the local and multiplied inconven|iences around it.'</P>
<P>'But how comes it,' &s;aid the other, 'that &s;uch adverti&s;ements are in&s;erted in the new&s;papers?'</P>
<P>'How comes it,' &s;aid the Captain, 'you puff off any article you wi&s;h to di&s;po&s;e of?&mdash;Do you think it is natural for a man, who has di&s;covered a trea|&s;ure, to call all the world to &s;hare it with him? This very rea&s;on ought to deter people, if they were not mad; they might be certain, if America was that happy land held out to them by de&s;igning men, all the vagabonds in Europe would not be in|vited to its bowers.'</P>
<P>After they had &s;ailed many days before a fair wind, the heavens became &s;uddenly ob&s;cured; black clouds embattled over the deep, which hi&s;&s;ed in ri&s;ing breakers again&s;t the &s;hip's &s;ide. Sudden &s;qualls furrow the dark bo&s;om of the ocean, and threatened, to tear the &s;ails from the yards. All hands were ordered to work; the &s;ails were furled, the yards &s;truck, the pumps cleared, and every pre|paration made for a &s;torm.'</P>
<P>'My dear Doctor,' &s;aid Frederick, in the cabin, 'now we &s;hall behold a grand di&s;play of magnificent &s;cenery; we &s;hall &s;ee Nature in a rage, and ad|mire the terrific features of her countenance.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="038973_0168_10128448E77F9280">'I hope not,' &s;aid the Doctor: 'I have no curi|o&s;ity to behold the bottom of the terrible &s;ea, to be hacked in pieces by the &s;word-fi&s;h, &s;mothered in the embraces of polypu&s;&s;es, or devoured by aligators.'</P>
<P>'A true philo&s;opher,' cried Stupeo, 'will behold the combu&s;tion of elements with tranquillity; he would not tremble were all the human race &s;cat|tered around his feet with a blaze of lightning; though the clouds were to become ignited and flame around his head; though the concave vault of the heavens was to become red hot; though the earth was to di&s;&s;olve with fulminations beneath his feet, and parting nature to mix in chaotic confu&s;ion, yet would he &s;tand firm and undi&s;mayed: Such are the effects of real philo&s;ophy.'</P>
<P>At that moment a loud cra&s;h of thunder bur&s;t over them, and rattled to a di&s;tance invarious directions.</P>
<P>'The devil take it,' cried Stupeo, 'that is a hor|rid &s;ma&s;h; the wind howls like an hundred wolves in a fore&s;t hung with &s;now. The &s;ea thumps a|gain&s;t the ve&s;&s;el as if it would break in the timbers. After all, men are very fooli&s;h to tru&s;t them&s;elves &s;o far from land in an egg-&s;hell.'</P>
<P>'It is nothing but an idea,' &s;aid Laura. 'What, are you frightened at your own ideas?'</P>
<P>'I am fearful,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'that even Mr. Hume mu&s;t al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow this &s;torm to be &s;omething more than idea.'</P>
<P>'I &s;hall go on deck,' &s;aid Frederick. 'I am like an Engli&s;hman &s;o far, that I am only afraid when I do not &s;ee the danger.'</P>
<P>'I will go with you,' &s;aid Laura; 'the &s;hip trembles &s;o much I cannot &s;it.'</P>
<P>It was with difficulty they could pre&s;erve them|&s;elves from falling, by gra&s;ping the hatchway; but the &s;cene that pre&s;ented was the mo&s;t terrible &s;ub|lime. One univer&s;al canopy of black clouds &s;eem|ed
<PB N="158" REF="038973_0169_1012844BFA98FA00">
to unite the ocean with the heavens, and the rain poured down in &s;uch torrents, that they might be &s;aid to be overwhelmed in water; through this, the vivid fla&s;hes of lightning played at lei&s;ure, dancing on the mountainous billows, and giving to the ridges of rolling waves, which tumbled over each other as if contending in a race, the momentary appearance of melting gold. The thunder was &s;o near, that it appeared rather &s;urrounding than above them, and the whole was a promi&s;cuous confu&s;ion of fire and water, the waves reflecting and refracting the varie|gated lightnings in every direction.</P>
<P>'Oh! great Creator of the univer&s;e,' &s;aid Laura, a tear of piety &s;tarting from her eye; 'Oh! that man would acknowledge thy power, for what pre|vents that thou &s;hould&s;t at this moment de&s;troy the whole earth, and expunge it from thy pre&s;ence for the crimes of its people!'</P>
<P>'Surely,' &s;aid Frederick, 'this is more than idea;&mdash;there mu&s;t be an omnipotent Being, not|with&s;tanding Mr. Hume and Stupeo. Were this &s;torm the production of chance, it might continue, it <HI>naturally</HI> would continue for ever, and overwhelm creation.'</P>
<P>'Chance!' repeated Laura: 'How has it hap|pened that this whole globe has never deviated from its orb? Why do not the planets leave their harmo|nic circles, and da&s;h each other to pieces?&mdash;Har|mony is not an attribute of chance, for the very word chance implies confu&s;ion. Surely, had not &s;ome infinite Being, whom we &s;hould tremble to name, given them their motions, they never could have continued within their orbit. But man, weak and &s;illy man, denies Providence and miracles, be|cau&s;e Providence is not every day working miracles to provide him a dinner.'</P>
<P>'That peal of thunder &s;eemed to me to &s;hake
<PB N="159" REF="038973_0170_1012844D9613B7D8">
the foundations of the univer&s;e,' &s;aid Frederick;&mdash; 'but you look quite compo&s;ed, Laura&mdash;are you not frightened?'</P>
<P>'I am indeed,' &s;aid &s;he, 'very much frightened, but I am not di&s;mayed.&mdash;It is true I am a weak woman, but I look beyond the&s;e heavy and &s;ulphur|ious clouds, to a Deity who knows the weakne&s;s of his creatures, and can, in his omnipotence, as well protect me us a world.'</P>
<P>'But do you think,' &s;aid Frederick, 'that he re|gards at all the actions of human beings? If he did&punc; why in the &s;hipwreck of a ve&s;&s;el &s;hall perhaps every man be drowned, except the mo&s;t execrable villain among&s;t them?'</P>
<P>'Becau&s;e that the good and the bad are &s;o con|nected, that a &s;torm cannot fall upon one without touching the other, and to a good man drowning, is a very trifling evil.'</P>
<P>'How &s;o? You &s;peak now like a philo&s;opher. Is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a trifle to be annihilated to &s;elf-con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, to lo&s;e all the plea&s;ures of life, and become no more than the &s;tone or vegetating &s;hrub?'</P>
<P>'Indeed,' an&s;wered Laura, 'if &s;uch are your &s;en|timents, death is to you the mo&s;t tremendous of evils&mdash;you mu&s;t &s;hudder at the idea, and to &s;ecure your&s;elf &s;ome paltry, tran&s;ient gratifications, per|petrate unnumbered crimes. But, amid&s;t this &s;torm, when the next moment may whelm us beneath the deep, &s;ee how calm a woman can be, who&s;e mind is acted upon by the cheering hopes of religion&punc; and who expects hereafter to live to a beatified eternity.'</P>
<P>'But I have no ideas of &s;uch a &s;tate, and we know that the vulgar notion of an heaven above us cannot phy&s;ically be true.'</P>
<P>'And why not?' &s;aid Laura;&mdash;'you will tell me perhaps, that beyond our &s;y&s;tem there are other &s;y&s;tems, and beyond the&s;e others, reaching to di&s;|tances
<PB N="160" REF="038973_0171_10128450A5227458">
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing comprehen&s;ion. But, is &s;pace bounded by our imagination, or is all &s;pace filled with &s;y&s;tems? Beyond all the&s;e &s;y&s;tems may there not be a &s;urrounding &s;pace, where every idea of heaven may be realized, where new regions of in|conceivable formation and glory may exi&s;t, for who &s;hall limit the Supreme? Even &s;uppo&s;e all &s;pace to be filled with &s;y&s;tems and worlds, may not the&s;e &s;tars be &s;o many different paradi&s;es, fitting the di&s;|po&s;ition of different &s;pirits?'</P>
<P>'The&s;e things,' &s;aid Frederick, 'may not be im|po&s;&s;ible; but they are very contrary to the doctrine of the great Stupeo. What a grand &s;cene is he lo&s;ing!&mdash;I will go and call him.'</P>
<P>The &s;torm now raged with &s;uch violence, that the &s;hip was given to the winds, driving between the furrows of the ru&s;hing waves. The great Stu|peo laid upon the cabin floor, uttering the mo&s;t horrid execrations&mdash;&s;wearing that all hell was broke loo&s;e, and that the black demons of the air were running the &s;hip into the clouds.</P>
<P>'That is a very &s;ublime idea,' &s;aid Frederick, 'but I hope not literal, for if there be an hell, what will become of us?'</P>
<P>'O God!' cried Doctor Alogos, 'I do ac|knowledge thy power, I was a fool ever to doubt it.'</P>
<P>Laura endeavoured to comfort poor Su&s;an and the re&s;t of the pa&s;&s;engers in the cabin; and the better to prevent reflection, &s;he de&s;ired them to &s;ing &s;ome p&s;alms, &s;etting the example by beginning the 104th. The novelty of &s;uch an action in &s;o de&s;pairing a &s;ituation gained their attention, and many joining in, the terror of the danger was damp|ed, and they felt a &s;omething of con&s;cious &s;atisfac|tion, which is unknown to any but tho&s;e who have been in &s;ome &s;imilar &s;ituation, or have felt the tran|quillity of a quiet con&s;cience;&mdash;even Stupeo him|&s;elf
<PB N="161" REF="038973_0172_1012845492BD5918">
changed his execrations into groans, and Fre|derick hung down his head in &s;ilent reflection.</P>
<P>The &s;torm gradually &s;ub&s;iding by degrees, the &s;everal characters of the company returned, with this difference, that Stupeo maintained with more ob&s;tinacy than ever his doctrine of chance and &s;cep|tici&s;m. Frederick wavered in his mind according to the impul&s;e of his pa&s;&s;ions; and Doctor Alogos became convinced that there was more in religion and <HI>common-place</HI> maxims of good and evil, than the great Stupeo would allow.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition they arrived at Philadelphia, and rejoiced at the pro&s;pect of having reached a place where truth and ju&s;tice had erected the &s;tan|dard of rea&s;on. Frederick was &s;urpri&s;ed to find the renowned city not &s;o large as that part of Mary-le-Bone which is built; but con&s;oled him&s;elf with the lo&s;s of one of the fine&s;t cities in the world, as he could look over the ground where it <HI>was</HI> to &s;tand.</P>
<P>As they pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets, they were hoot|ed at by the children, and called vagabond Eng|li&s;h, with other opprobrious names. 'This is very &s;trange,' &s;aid Frederick: 'I thought the Americans made no di&s;tinctions of country; but we are only &s;trangers yet&mdash;they will re&s;pect us when they know us better.'</P>
<P>They procured lodgings at an extravagant rate, and calling for refre&s;hment, received &s;ome very coar&s;e cakes, wretched butter, and &s;alt meat, for in &s;ummer no <HI>fre&s;h</HI> meat will keep a day; and for this they paid more than the be&s;t articles would have co&s;t in London.</P>
<P>'Things are not quite as they &s;hould be even here,' &s;aid the Doctor.</P>
<P>'What do you mean by that?' &s;aid an American
<PB N="162" REF="038973_0173_101284563473F2B0">
<HI>waiter.</HI> 'Do you mean to &s;tigmatize Congre&s;s?'</P>
<P>'Heaven forbid,' replied the Doctor: 'I &s;hould like to &s;peak to your ma&s;ter about my bag|gage.'</P>
<P>'My ma&s;ter! I dont know &s;uch a man. Do you think I am a &s;lave?&mdash;I am a republican, a free|born American. But who are you? &s;ome lou&s;y, beggarly emigr&eacute;, come here to cut wood and hew &s;tone for us.'</P>
<P>Doctor Alogos looked in &s;ilent amazement.&mdash; Frederick was ri&s;ing to kick the republican down &s;tairs; but Stupeo ob&s;erved that this was the gen|uine blunt &s;pirit of freedom; that, like Spartans, the Americans took perfect liberty of &s;peech.</P>
<P>'But they do not &s;eem to allow it to others,' &s;aid Laura.</P>
<P>The heat was extremely inten&s;e, &s;o much &s;o, that the whole company confined them&s;elves within doors, deliberating on the mode they &s;hould adopt in pro|moting their pa&s;toral &s;cheme. Laura amu&s;ed her|&s;elf at the windows: to her it had an air of novelty to &s;ee every third per&s;on a black; but &s;he was a&s;ton|i&s;hed to &s;ee the people labouring notwith&s;tanding the violent heat, which was almo&s;t &s;uffocating to tho&s;e who remained inactive; and the &s;warms of mu&s;quetoes were to Engli&s;hmen a perfect plague.</P>
<P>'The&s;e labourers,' &s;aid a waiting maid, 'are Scotch, Iri&s;h, and German emigrants, who earn <HI>eleven &s;hillings</HI> a day currency.</P>
<P>'Eleven &s;hillings a day!' exclaimed Frederick; 'it is more than our pea&s;ants in England earn in a week: they mu&s;t live like noblemen. But what do you call currency?'</P>
<P>'Why it is about &s;ix and &s;ix-pence Engli&s;h; but they are very badly off for all that, for every thing

is &s;o dear they can hardly live upon it, and one half of them &s;oon die of fevers and agues.'</P>
<P>The landlord's daughter was a prettyi&s;h girl, and night coming on, Frederick reque&s;ted her to <HI>bundle</HI> with him. 'If you in&s;ult me,' &s;aid &s;he, 'our Mat|thew &s;hall bundle you into the Delaware.'</P>
<P>Frederick was a&s;toni&s;hed at this frankne&s;s. It is very different here, &s;aid he to him&s;elf; but I do not know whether it is all for the better.</P>
<P>In the night Frederick was di&s;turbed by the rum|bling of carts:&mdash;It is very &s;trange, thought he, that &s;o many nightmen are at work at once in &s;uch a lit|tle city, or perhaps they all come through this &s;treet. The Americans &s;urely do not go in carts to balls. In the morning he inquired, and was informed it was only the <HI>dead carts</HI> that carried away tho&s;e who died in the cour&s;e of the day.</P>
<P>'That is &s;trange,' &s;aid he, 'I counted near twen|ty, and this city is of very narrow extent.' 'It is a very magnificent city, and the large&s;t in all the union,' &s;aid the landlord;&mdash;'but the yellow fever carries off &s;ome dozens in a day; however, we don't mind the&s;e things &s;ince we have got our inde|pendence.'</P>
<P>'Very true,' replied the Doctor: 'liberty &s;weetens every thing, and it is a glorious epoch in the annals of man, that property cea&s;es in this great we&s;tern continent to influence the actions of men.'</P>
<P>The landlord gazed with &s;urpri&s;e. 'Property,' &s;aid he, 'is the only &s;timulus to commerce&mdash;com|merce is the &s;upport of arts and &s;ciences, and no man will be above trade: we have no hone&s;t gen|tlemen here&mdash;no idle hands&mdash;if a man will not work, he may &s;tarve.'</P>
<P>'That is a dete&s;table &s;y&s;tem,' &s;aid Stupeo; 'the ancient Spartans never degraded them&s;elves with work. Man, in a &s;tate of nature, does not work,
<PB N="164" REF="038973_0175_1012845E3326F880">
he has few wants, and the&s;e the waters or the woods &s;upply.'</P>
<P>'That may be, friend; but our motto is, <HI>endure, but hope,</HI> and that of all new-comers is, <HI>work, or &s;tarve.</HI> I &s;ee you are a green-one yet, and un&s;ea|&s;oned; all you people from the old world think money is made for nothing here&mdash; but it is all a farce.'</P>
<P>'Where in the world,' &s;aid the Doctor, '&s;hall we find the genuine principles of liberty and equali|ty?'</P>
<P>'As to liberty,' &s;aid the American, 'every man has liberty to follow any trade he plea&s;es, and to vote for the Congre&s;s, if he is a naturalized citizen; and as to equality, we have no titles except <HI>'&s;quire,</HI> but for equality of property, as &s;ome of our own people would like it, it is a mere fire-fly of a dark evening.'</P>
<P>The idea of the yellow fever had damped the &s;pirits of the whole company, and it was re&s;olved to quit the city of Philadelphia with all convenient &s;peed. This matter was under con&s;ideration when a thin man entered the room.</P>
<P>'My good friends,' &s;aid he, 'I under&s;tand you intend &s;ettling upon an agricultural plan. Agri|culture is the mo&s;t noble pur&s;uit of independent man, and a &s;ure &s;ource of wealth.' 'How did you know our intention?' &s;aid the Doctor: 'we have not yet been twenty-four hours in the city.'</P>
<P>'My de&s;ire to &s;erve all mankind,' replied he, 'and to prevent the &s;chemes of impo&s;tors, who, taking advantage of their local knowledge, often deceive and cheat &s;trangers, has led me to intrude upon you.'</P>
<P>'Indeed,' &s;aid Alogos, 'I thought all the people of the new world had been di&s;intere&s;ted and benev|olent

<P>'Why are the&s;e roads?' &s;aid Frederick: 'You ought to throw every impediment in the way of commerce&mdash;it is thence ari&s;es all our evils.'</P>
<P>'That is very true, Sir, but in this country to talk di&s;re&s;pectfully of commerce is high trea&s;on: we are a commercial people. By means of the&s;e roads and canals, we have peopled the great wil|derne&s;s, and planted &s;ettlements where only rattle|&s;nakes u&s;ed to ba&s;k. To what part of the continent do you intend journeying?'</P>
<P>'That we are undetermined upon,' &s;aid the Doc|tor: 'we would be as far from &s;ociety as we can, and in a country where we can enjoy the advanta|ges of nature.'</P>
<P>'Then Kentucky is your object; it is the mo&s;t delectable &s;pot on the face of the earth; it is a &s;econd Arcadia&mdash;a continued &s;cene of romantic delight, and picture&s;que pro&s;pects.

<P>'Twelve guineas for the hundred acres!' ex|claimed the Doctor: 'why you mi&s;take, you are giving the land away. Ah! if all the poor vaga|bonds in the old world knew that here they could have a portion of earth for almo&s;t nothing, they would beg, borrow, or &s;teal, to procure a pa&s;&s;age to this land of milk and honey.'</P>
<P>'There are thou&s;ands every year,' &s;aid the &s;tran|ger, 'who benefit by our ho&s;pitality. If I might advi&s;e, this plat of ground, &s;ituated on the north fork of the Elkhorn, is the mo&s;t eligible for a fir&s;t &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>'Well,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'if you bring me the title deeds and witne&s;&s;es, I will purcha&s;e that: A thou&s;and acres is ju&s;t an hundred and eight guineas, and that is a mere &s;ong.'</P>
<P>'Indeed,' &s;aid Common, with a &s;tare, 'you &s;hall have the deeds drawn out and regi&s;tered with pre|ci&s;ion.'&mdash;This being &s;ettled, he ob&s;erved, that at &s;uch a di&s;tance, they would require to take with them various implements of hu&s;bandry, and articles of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, every thing being tripled in expence beyond the Alleghany mountains.</P>
<P>'But why,' &s;aid Frederick, '&s;hould we encumber our&s;elves with articles of luxury? We intend to quit &s;ociety, and will not load our&s;elves with its inconve|niences.'</P>
<P>'My dear Sir,' &s;aid Common, 'you advance be|yond the mark; &s;o much do we depend upon each other, that we can neither begin nor proceed with|out the co-operations of our fellows: For in&s;tance, how will you cultivate the earth? Will you tear down the trees with your bodily prowe&s;s? or will you turn the &s;od with your nails? You mu&s;t have

<P>'We are obliged to have all the&s;e in England,' &s;aid Frederick: 'I do not &s;ee that labour is le&s;s or more ea&s;y in the new world than the old.'</P>
<P>'Infinitely &s;o,' cried Common; 'farmers here work for them&s;elves, wages are &s;o high that they cannot afford to hire men, and land is &s;o cheap that &s;ervants &s;oon become ma&s;ters.'</P>
<P>'That is as it &s;hould be,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'that is &s;omething like equality. In our country, a farmer, with a few hundred acres does little more than over|look his &s;ervants.'</P>
<P>Under the directions of Common, near a thou&s;and pounds were expended in articles nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;et|tlement&mdash;the patent was made out at the regular office, and four waggons waited the plea&s;ure of the&s;e great men, who quitted the haunts of luxury in &s;earch of virtue and liberty in an howling wilder|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Every article as they pa&s;&s;ed along the road was exorbitantly dear, &s;eventeen dollars being charged for a common dinner for them&s;elves and their hor|&s;es; but what more a&s;toni&s;hed them, was the im|pertinence of the inn-keepers, who being all agricul|tural men, did not altogether depend on their inns, and conceived travellers to be the obliged par|ties.</P>
<P>'This is very &s;ingular ho&s;pitality,' &s;aid the Doc|tor: 'I have read a book which informed me it was cu&s;tomary to travel from farm-hou&s;e to farm-hou&s;e, and from New-England to Maryland, almo&s;t free of expen&s;e.'</P>
<P>'Republicans,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'are independent people, they do not cringe and fawn upon you for a &s;hilling like your traders in Europe; they po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;cious manly dignity.'</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="038973_0180_1012846B942AC010">'The dignity of an inn-keeper is certainly very great,' &s;aid Laura; 'but I prefer the &s;lavi&s;h Euro|pean, where people &s;eem obliged to you at lea&s;t.'</P>
<P>As they advanced over the mountains to Fort Pitt, they were charmed with the &s;cenery, and the maje&s;tic river Ohio, down which they &s;ailed, be|tween exten&s;ive &s;avannas and high-towering for|e&s;ts, where &s;carcely the beams of day, much le&s;s the foot of man, ever penetrated.</P>
<P>Stupeo, who was a man of profound reflection, was frequently &s;ubject to melancholy, to di&s;&s;ipate which, he had recour&s;e to peach brandy and Amer|ican rum, (indeed the&s;e mingled with water are the common drink); but though he was no milk&s;op, he was &s;oon &s;eized with a dy&s;entery, which to his com|fort he found was very u&s;ual to new comers.</P>
<P>Being arrived at Lexington, the metropolis of the fine&s;t country in the world, they were a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed at &s;ight of about thirty ill-looking wooden hou&s;es, but they had &s;een &s;o many wonders in the new world, that they were not altogether confound|ed, and Stupeo declared that he was delighted at the pro&s;pect of coming nearer a &s;tate of nature than they had even hoped or expected.</P>
<P>Their large train of baggage was a &s;ufficient &s;ign of importance to procure them &s;everal vi&s;itors&punc; by this means the place of their intended &s;ettlement was quickly known, and a great deal of unnece&s;&s;ary trouble avoided, there being already a family at Lexington, come from Virginia, with a grant for the &s;ame land, which they were unable to &s;ettle, it being already in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another holder.</P>
<P>'This is inconceivable,' &s;aid Doctor Alogos; 'one had need po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;hare of <HI>&s;uffering</HI> philo&s;ophy to endure this; but how am I to be righted?'</P>
<P>'You may go to law,' replied the informant. 'I am an attorney, and will do you ju&s;tice; for

<P>'Go to law!' cried the Doctor with horror; 'what are there laws and lawyers in a wilderne&s;s? I expected to have found nothing wor&s;e than rattle|&s;nakes and tigers.'</P>
<P>'The world could not exi&s;t without law,' &s;aid the lawyer. 'Why, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to purcha&s;e a lot of land here without a law-&s;uit entailed, for at the office they grant patent upon patent, &s;o that any man may choo&s;e what part he prefers of the whole country, and when he is here he cannot ea&s;ily return.'</P>
<P>'That is right,' cried Stupeo, 'that is exactly my &s;y&s;tem of argument, the greate&s;t re&s;ulting good is the fir&s;t to be defined; the wilderne&s;s mu&s;t be peo|pled, and the human race expanded over the &s;ur|face of the earth.'</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV. The Plea&s;ures of bending Nature to the rules of art&mdash; Stupeo and Su&s;an determine to People the wilderne&s;s&mdash; the Superiority of &s;avage life exemplified.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING made a purcha&s;e of three hundred acres, about one hundred and fifty miles from Lex|ington, nearer the Ohio, containing two fine mill-&s;eats, with water-carriage for timber, they began their march through the wilderne&s;s. Every ten or twelve miles along the road a little plantation was begun. Laura looked in vain for the blooming orchards and &s;ugar-groves, with fine lawns beneath them; &s;he &s;aw indeed &s;ome clu&s;ters of &s;ugar-maple trees at intervals in the woods, where <HI>Nature</HI> had planted them; but as to the velvet meadows, no|thing of that &s;ort appeared, the native gra&s;s being &s;everal feet high, matted &s;o as to be almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, and too rank for any u&s;e. The weather was in&s;uf|ferably hot&mdash;millions of in&s;ects tormented them night and day&mdash;&s;nakes curled along the tracks (called roads) and prodigious large frogs and toads wallow|ed in every little tank of &s;tagnant water, which the impenetrable fore&s;t prevented the &s;un from evapo|rating.</P>
<P>Neither milk nor butter were procurable at any price, and they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of drink|ing &s;pirits and water, which threw them all into &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight fevers, and added &s;trength to the di&s;ea&s;e of Stupeo.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the place where they were to
<PB N="172" REF="038973_0183_101284760271B3B0">
&s;ettle, they were a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find it covered with prodigious large trees, which &s;eemed to bid defiance to human labour. A thick cane brake over-ran half the &s;urface, and was &s;o matted and entangled with the trees, that they could not even clear a path through. The ground, which was not thus covered, was apparently &s;o barren, that the black heaths of England were a &s;ort of comparative garden.</P>
<P>'It is plain to me,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'that cultivat|ing the ground is a deviation from the &s;tate of na|ture. Has &s;he not &s;pread her wide extended branches to &s;helter us from heat and from rain? Has &s;he not &s;cattered various fruits and &s;hrubs with|in our reach, and what do we want more? When we &s;hall have &s;pent our &s;trength in de&s;troying the&s;e trees, and laboured to rai&s;e the rotten &s;ods into life, &s;hall we not &s;et &s;ome value on the earth? We &s;hall become proud, &s;elfi&s;h and tyrannical&mdash;we &s;hall not readily yield it to another, and thus we give birth to all the horrors of civil life.'</P>
<P>'It is too late now to retract,' &s;aid Laura; '&s;urely the re&s;ources of philo&s;ophy are not exhau&s;t|ed, rea&s;on and truth have now full power to expand unchecked in the de&s;ert wild.'</P>
<P>'To be perfectly free,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'we &s;hould be|come like the roaming Indians; let us give to man|kind a great and glorious example? Let us ca&s;t a&s;ide our cloths, they are an incumbrance beneath the dignity of virtue, let us live like the wild In|dians.'</P>
<P>'You may if you like' &s;aid Laura, laughing, 'but I fear you will not ea&s;ily do without brandy, and that is a forbidden article in the big book of Na|ture.'</P>
<P>'For my part,' &s;aid Frederick, 'I will try the inconveniences of a detached life before I wholly en|ter

into a &s;tate of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avagi&s;m; we have contracted &s;o many unnatural wants, which rea&s;on knows to be u&s;ele&s;s, that it requires time to root out our habits and prejudices.'</P>
<P>In about a week's time, an uncomfortable hovel was erected, with the help of &s;ome neighbours; but the&s;e philo&s;ophers had &s;o little re&s;olution in encoun|tering great difficulties, that the&s;e three great men were another week before they had cut off the low|er boughs of a few trees, where they had planned a kitchen garden.</P>
<P>Stupeo was thrown off his legs with the little ex|ertion he had made, the heat and the bad provi&s;ions, no meat, keeping without &s;alt. No phy&s;ician was within many miles, except one, an ignorant quack, who&s;e whole knowledge was drawn from Salmon's Di&s;pen&s;atory, and the London Complete Art of Healing.</P>
<P>Stupeo pretended he rejoiced that Nature would have her cour&s;e; but &s;he &s;oon &s;o reduced him, that it was evident the great man would quit the world without having cau&s;ed one revolution; and the Doctor di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger for the &s;urgeon, who, on his arrival, pre&s;cribed &s;ome common medicines, which greatly relieved the patient.</P>
<P>Doctor Alogos lamented the want of books, though he had very little time to read; what lei&s;ure he had was &s;pent in idle repining, and cur&s;ing the day he ever &s;et his foot on the new world, which to his eyes appeared only half formed. He had anoth|er &s;ubject of di&s;quiet in Su&s;an, who was every day reproaching him with having carried her out of the world to die in a de&s;art. Laura was the only one any way contented, for the &s;weetne&s;s of her di&s;po|&s;ition, and her affection for her uncle, overlooked ma|ny difficulties. Surely, thought the Doctor, there is &s;omething at lea&s;t very plea&s;ant in the attachment
<PB N="174" REF="038973_0185_1012847B59632928">
of kindred, and though &s;he may love me as an in|dividual, contrary to the new philo&s;ophy, I do not perceive any great evil in it.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s they made in cultivation &s;erved only to &s;hew them the futility of their undertaking and a whole family happening to die of a fever occa&s;ioned by over-labour, they purcha&s;ed the farm, which had been brought into &s;ome degree of cultivation.&mdash; The ground, which had never been turned up to the air, being compo&s;ed of rotten vegetable &s;ub|&s;tance, was loaded with febrile particles and noxious vapour, the effects of which are frequently &s;een in the deaths of new comers; nor did the Doctor and Frederick e&s;cape without a &s;evere fit of the ague, which di&s;abled them from labour.</P>
<P>The great Stupeo &s;eemed here buried in unwor|thy ob&s;curity; he &s;aw his genius and talents unem|ployed, and mankind unbenefited by his labours. He had fruitle&s;sly attempted to injure the innocence of Laura, who dete&s;ted him even more than Fred|erick; and he re&s;olved no longer to &s;uffer the un|ju&s;t monoply which Doctor Alogos practi&s;ed in the per&s;on of Su&s;an. The latter was heartily tired of the Doctor, who was not &s;o young as Stupeo, and having imbibed the real principles of equality, &s;he made very little difficulty of aiding to people this wilderne&s;s, where, it mu&s;t be confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed, there was a little too much of &s;olitude.</P>
<P>The Doctor beheld, as a &s;ingular phenomenon, the change of Su&s;an's &s;hape, which neither rea&s;on nor argument could account for, though it was evi|dent there mu&s;t have been a cau&s;e &s;uperior to chance.</P>
<P>'It may be nothing more than an idea,' &s;aid Stupeo; 'but at any rate it does not &s;ignify who is the parent of the child&mdash;the re&s;ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing good is equal; it is of no con&s;equence to the child becau&s;e under

the protection of philo&s;ophy, its mind will gradually expand to the genial beams of truth. I am of opin|ion, that children &s;hould be brought up indifferently by the male or female, as it may happen. Why, I would a&s;k, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, are not men as well calculated for nur&s;es as wo|men?'</P>
<P>'Becau&s;e,' &s;aid Laura, 'they are not &s;o dome&s;|tic, and becau&s;e Providence has provided the female with a nutriment adapted to the tenderne&s;s of in|fancy.'</P>
<P>'That ari&s;es from mere repletion,' &s;aid the great philo&s;opher, 'and is the &s;ource of all our di&s;ea&s;es&mdash; we draw in corruption at the brea&s;t, and if we would one day become immortal, I am of opinion we &s;hould be educated independent from the birth, and fed upon &s;omething more natural than milk, which is of all &s;ub&s;tances &s;oone&s;t corrupted.'</P>
<P>'Of cour&s;e upon brandy,' &s;aid Laura: 'brandy is one of the lea&s;t corruptible of fluids.'</P>
<P>Su&s;an, in due time, brought a man child into the world; but no phy&s;ician or per&s;on of &s;kill being within reach, an ignorant old woman officiated, and the poor wretch expired in agony.</P>
<P>'Such,' cried Stupeo, 'are the con&s;equences of being neither in or out of &s;ociety:&mdash;Here we are in a de&s;art, abandoned by our &s;pecies, with all the habits we contracted in &s;ociety, and no means to &s;at|isfy them;&mdash;if we had been in a &s;tate of nature, nature would have accompli&s;hed every thing.'</P>
<P>The Doctor was &s;hocked at the event, though &s;atisfied &s;he had not been con&s;tant to him&s;elf; and he more than ever began to doubt the reality and practicability of the &s;ublime doctrines of the new philo&s;ophy. Stupeo undertook the education of the boy, whom he in&s;i&s;ted &s;hould enjoy perfect freedom,
<PB N="176" REF="038973_0187_1012848136417EF0">
and be allowed to crawl about the hou&s;e like any other animal.</P>
<P>'He &s;hall not be thwarted in any thing,' &s;aid he: 'The great Rou&s;&s;eau tells us that we only implan vices into children by pretending to teach them ju&s;tice, and de&s;troy the temper by checking the &s;al|lies of imagination.' Unfortunately for the enlight|ened &s;y&s;tem of education, this grand experiment proved abortive. The tender infant &s;ickened and died of a con&s;umption.</P>
<P>Frederick, however, maintained that it was the kindne&s;s of Laura which killed it;. and Stupeo di&s;|covered that it was &s;tung to death by mu&s;quetoes, its body being delicate, and not plai&s;tered over with unguents of grea&s;e, like the infants of Indians; and the Doctor &s;wore that Stupeo had poi&s;oned it with brandy. Thus the&s;e three great men could not agree upon &s;o in&s;ignificant a thing as the death of a child under a grand philo&s;ophical experiment: Where then is the wonder that men are daily outting each others throats for difference of political opin|ion?</P>
<P>One day when the&s;e three philo&s;ophers were la|bouring in the field, &s;ometimes uttering execrations, and &s;ometimes di&s;puting, not a little to the prejudice of <HI>immutible</HI> truth, which often appeared in differ|ent &s;hapes, a troop of Miama Indians cro&s;&s;ed the Ohio in their punts, and carried off all the portable articles at the little farm, which they had dignified with the name of Clarens. Poor Laura &s;hared the fate of the re&s;t of the &s;tock, and it was not known to the philo&s;ophers till their return home.</P>
<P>'Black forever be the day!' exclaimed the Doctor, 'when I left England with all its evils&mdash; there, per&s;ons and property enjoy &s;ome protection. Alas! my dear Laura, my beloved child is murder|ed and &s;calped!'</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="038973_0188_101284858EC9CFF8">'Nothing more natural,' &s;aid Stupeo, coolly; '&s;avages do not make tho&s;e childi&s;h di&s;tinctions we do between beauty and ugline&s;s&mdash;revenge is all they &s;eek, for the unju&s;t u&s;urpation of the Europeans:&mdash; Are we not driving them from their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and daily narrowing their bounds and power to live?'</P>
<P>'What have they done,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'in the cour&s;e of &s;ome thou&s;and years? The utmo&s;t ex|tent of their knowledge in agriculture, is the plant|ing of a few &s;lips of maize and tobacco.'</P>

An Indian is with them the mo&s;t virtuous of human beings; and they make him utter &s;entiments he never heard, and perform actions which never were witne&s;&s;ed. Why is all this but to loo&s;en men from the reciprocal bonds of &s;ociety, and to &s;ap the foundations of human governments. So far in|deed are the Indians removed from, the&s;e <HI>&s;entimental phantoms,</HI> that they are totally the contrary; though the emancipation of the negroes, and the inhumanity of Chri&s;tians, is an excel|lent &s;talking hor&s;e, for tho&s;e who pretend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er feelings than the re&s;t of mankind.

<P>A black &s;lave, whom the&s;e advocates for univer|&s;al freedom had <HI>purcha&s;ed,</HI> his labour being cheap|er than an hired &s;ervant, now entered the hut, with the tidings that Laura had been &s;een cro&s;&s;|ing the Ohio, with the Indians, in a we&s;tern direc|tion.</P>
<P>Doctor Alogos, at this intelligence, rou&s;ed him|&s;elf to action, and the two philo&s;ophers propo&s;ed to accompany him, more from an expectance of novel|ty, than any de&s;ire to recover Laura, who would never attend to the lectures of the&s;e great men.</P>

<P>This he was prevailed upon to give up, by the ob&s;ervance that the Indians were not &s;o dive&s;ted of all art as to be without arms, the&s;e being nece&s;&s;a|ry in a roaming life to procure them&s;elves food.</P>
<P>Doctor Alogos, who had no wi&s;h to return with|out his niece, complied with all the &s;ublime whims of the&s;e great men; and though he was far from being in perfect health, he attended them through the dreary labyrinths of an almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able fore&s;t, where hunger and thir&s;t were their con&s;tant com|panions.</P>
<P>For near ten days they did not &s;ee a &s;ingle human being except them&s;elves. They had fallen in with a drove of buffaloes, on one of which they made a plentiful repa&s;t. Their &s;hoes were already worn out, and the green hide bound with thongs &s;upplied the place; though they now ran con&s;iderable haz|ard from the &s;warms of &s;nakes which ba&s;ked in the &s;un, or hung from the trees like caterpillars in an Engli&s;h hedge. Frederick being the talle&s;t, had re|ceived &s;everal &s;evere confu&s;ions from the boughs of the trees, and the infinite &s;warms of mu&s;quetoes which &s;eemed to fill the air, goaded the whole party ince&s;&s;antly.</P>
<P>Some Indians they accidentally fell in with, ran away from them in terror. In the woods they found &s;everal &s;keletons, which, from their mutilated &s;tate, appeared to have been killed in battle.</P>
<P>'It is very &s;ingular,' &s;aid Frederick, 'that even the&s;e &s;avages, who are very little more advanced in civil life than an Ouran-outang, &s;hould delight &s;o much in war.</P>

the manly virtues are lo&s;t, when arts and &s;ciences are cultivated. Look back to the ancients&mdash;the Celtae, the Danes, the Goths, the Scythians, and all tho&s;e hardy tribes who lived only in war, we &s;hall there find all the heroic virtues, the contempt of danger, the bravery of &s;ea&s;ons, the genero&s;ity of friend&s;hip, and the gallantry to the fair, &s;o peculiar to the times of chivalry &mdash; all the&s;e are the children of a &s;tate of perpetual war.'</P>
<P>'I thought,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'you held gallan|try in contempt, as a pu&s;illanimous trifling, unwor|thy a great mind; and that particular friend&s;hips are an outrage again&s;t political ju&s;tice.'</P>
<P>'So I do,' cried Stupeo? 'and whoever knew me retract what I once advanced?'</P>
<P>'But how do you reconcile the contradiction?'</P>
<P>'A philo&s;opher can reconcile every thing.&mdash;The new philo&s;ophy is founded upon the broad expanded ba&s;is of univer&s;al truth; it e&s;tabli&s;hes principles not all the powers of kings and prie&s;ts &s;hall overthrow, much le&s;s a few contradictions.'</P>

<P>'We mu&s;t acknowledge,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'this is very &s;trange;&mdash;the women appear univer&s;ally to be &s;laves to the men; but, alas! what a mere brute is man, when &s;ome greater law than his own will does not curb his pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>'I find nothing &s;trange in all this,' &s;aid Stupeo. 'The&s;e men are ignorant of the &s;ublime doctrines of philo&s;ophy&mdash;they do things without &s;eeing their fitne&s;s, and therefore may err a little in promoting univer&s;al good; for in&s;tance, what is there unnatur|al in this revolution of kindred; is it not a com|mon practice with animals?'</P>

<P>The following day they cro&s;&s;ed a large &s;avanna, where they could not procure the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;te|nance, and in the evening tired and exhau&s;ted, they arrived at a little &s;ettlement of Indians.</P>
<P>'Now,' cried Frederick; in rapture, 'we &s;hall behold genuine ho&s;pitality; we &s;hall &s;ee pure nature, un&s;ophi&s;ticated by the vices of &s;ociety?</P>
<P>They reque&s;ted of an Indian, in an humble tone, &s;ome hoe-cake, but received for an&s;wer, that they had &s;carcely &s;ufficient for them&s;elves, and a demand of &s;ome of their arms.</P>
<P>This was very unexpected to the&s;e philo&s;ophers, who, notwith&s;tanding their knowledge of human nature, often made egregious mi&s;takes, and finding pity and ho&s;pitality alike unknown, they bargained for a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, in exchange for a brace of pi&s;tols and &s;ome &s;hot.</P>
<P>'The&s;e men,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'mu&s;t have been con|taminated by trading with Europeans, at lea&s;t they po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtues of &s;acred friend&s;hip; with them the &s;ecurity of oaths is unnece&s;&s;ary.'</P>

<P>'So much for &s;avage hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice,' &s;aid Alogos: 'they are a parcel of ra&s;cally thieves, and where is their &s;acred ho&s;pitality in leaving us here to peri&s;h in a wild, without arms or clothes; for we have &s;aved nothing but what we kept on our backs, or concealed beneath the gra&s;s at the reque&s;t of Mungo.'</P>
<P>'In the fir&s;t place,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'we have no right to complain, they have not taken our lives, which, from our imprudence, was in their power; and in the &s;econd, we mi&s;take terms. In &s;ociety, I grant this would be called a robbery, but, among&s;t the children of nature, it is only taking from anoth|er what they want to u&s;e them&s;elves; they have not our ideas of particular property.'</P>
<P>'It &s;eems to me however,' &s;aid Frederick, 'that they were con&s;cious of inju&s;tice, or they would not all have departed in this &s;neaking way. I begin to think the &s;avage &s;tate of man is not conducted on philo&s;ophical principles.'</P>

<P>OUR troop of philo&s;ophical vagabonds &s;et out, they knew not whither, and had not gone far before they found, expo&s;ed beneath a tree, an Indian child, puny, weak, and almo&s;t expiring.</P>
<P>'Behold,' cried Alogos, 'the humanity of &s;ava|ges! this, I &s;uppo&s;e, is parental care.

<P>'It is a glorious practice,' exclaimed Stupeo; 'and &s;hews them to be, in fact, more humane than our&s;elves. Of what value is life with an unheal|thy or deformed per&s;on? We are, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, a burden to our&s;elves and to others.'</P>
<P>'But how many great heroes and philo&s;ophers have had very little per&s;ons,' &s;aid Doctor Alogos. 'I do not apprehend the human mind to be in ad|mea&s;urement

<P>'It explains to me,' &s;aid Frederick, 'what I had attributed to their manner of life and want of luxuries. It is ea&s;y to have none but people of &s;trength and vigour, if all that are otherwi&s;e be de|&s;troyed in infancy.'</P>
<P>'Experience,' replied Alogos, with a deep &s;igh, 'is the be&s;t &s;chool, but the mi&s;chief is, that tho&s;e who are yet well, will not take warning by example, till they &s;uffer them&s;elves.'</P>
<P>For forty days they continued to wander, more than once encountering a few &s;traggling Indians, who attempted to convince them, that in a &s;tate of nature, <HI>force</HI> was the only law, and pa&s;&s;ion the on|ly &s;tandard of right. They came at length to a great chain of mountains, extremely barren, and placed in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that they appeared &s;catter|ed by the hand of tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>They had continued their journey, merely from the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of rambling, and the dread they felt of returning to their delightful farm of Clarens.&mdash; They now debated whether they &s;hould climb the &s;ummit, or take &s;ome other route; but the expec|tation of beholding an entire new country, invited them to labour at the &s;teep. They were by this time &s;o accu&s;tomed to hard&s;hip, that a trifle could not intimidate them, and in three days they gained the elevation of the mountains.</P>
<P>They gazed upon the pro&s;pect beneath them, which was much &s;uperior to their expectation. A

fine level country, inter&s;per&s;ed with gentle &s;wellings, and inter&s;ected with limpid &s;treams, watering ex|ten&s;ive groves, pre&s;ented it&s;elf. Among&s;t the groves appeared high &s;pires and lofty domes, evidently the workman&s;hip of ingenious arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophers were enraptured, and wearied them&s;elves in conjectures of what region they could be advanced to. They waited impatiently for the morning, when they began to unravel the mazes which wound down from the mountains, and it was the en&s;uing day before they reached the ba&s;e.</P>
<P>They then refre&s;hed them&s;elves with &s;ome fine fruit, which &s;eemed to grow neglected, and pro|ceeded forward towards the great piles of buildings which they had &s;een from far. They overtook a man who was &s;lowly walking, with his eyes bent up|on the ground, as if in deep &s;tudy, and totally nak|ed. Our philo&s;ophers were therefore not put out of countenance by their own ragged appearance.</P>
<P>Doctor Alogos acco&s;ted him in various languages, but without being under&s;tood, when the man in|quired in Hebrew what they were, and how they came into that country.&mdash;'Why do you walk nak|ed?' &s;aid the Doctor.</P>
<P>'Becau&s;e we have nobody to make clothes.'&mdash; 'How do you employ your&s;elves?'&mdash;'I am &s;tudy|ing the public good.'</P>
<P>'Studying the public good!' repeated the Doc|tor: 'you are then a legi&s;lator of the country?'&mdash; 'No, I am a private individual; but it is the place of every man to &s;tudy to promote the public good.'</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed this politician, who &s;eemed un|willing to &s;peak much, our vagabonds di&s;puted with them&s;elves, on the nature of the country, which they thought very &s;trange, e&s;pecially as they met

&s;everal per&s;ons employed &s;tudying the public good. A man &s;triking a tree &s;ometimes with his fi&s;t, and then with his head, induced the Doctor to inquire the meaning of &s;o &s;ingular an action. 'What are you doing?' &s;aid the Doctor. 'I am endeavouring to drive this <HI>idea</HI> out of my path.' 'That is not an idea,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'that is a reality.'&mdash;'All things are ideas,' replied the man: 'every thing which appears to exi&s;t, is merely an idea; we can|not prove that there is reality, body, &s;ub&s;tance, ex|ten&s;ion, or any &s;uch quality.'</P>
<P>'Very good,' &s;aid the Doctor: 'I fancy before you have beat that idea, in form of a tree, out of your way, you will have an idea of a fractured &s;kull.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a&s;toni&s;hing how ridiculous and even irrational the new doctrines appear, when taken from the page of metaphy|&s;ics, and contra&s;ted with practice.</NOTE>'</P>
<P>As they advanced along the high road, the hedges of which were fallen into decay, they over|took a troop of people, who were moving a tree by means of a machine; the greater part &s;tood idle, while five or &s;ix furthered the work. Doctor Alo|gos inquired of the neare&s;t what was the name of the country. The man pau&s;ed for &s;ome time, at length replied, 'I do not think it for the public good to an&s;wer you&mdash;I will reflect upon it.' While he &s;tood reflecting, he was called by his comrades; the fir&s;t gang or labourers retiring for another to take their places.</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded onwards towards the great city. They perceived &s;ome builders repairing an hou&s;e, which, from its &s;ingular con&s;truction, en|gaged their attention. While they &s;tood admiring, all the labourers gave over work. A man, who was half way up a ladder, fixed his burden on an
<PB N="189" REF="038973_0200_101284A68C890BA0">
hook, which &s;eemed there on purpo&s;e. Some men winding up a crane, fixed the pulley upon a catch, and left the beam hanging in the air. The whole party &s;auntered away different ways, and a new &s;et advancing, began to labour. The travellers reflected on this incident, remaining &s;tationary for &s;ome time. In half an hour this new &s;et of builders retired like the former, and another troop advanced.</P>
<P>'This is a curious mode of building,' &s;aid the Doctor. 'It &s;eems an equal divi&s;ion of labour,' &s;aid Stupeo; 'I dare &s;ay we are arrived at la&s;t in a country of philo&s;ophers.'</P>
<P>'But at this rate an hou&s;e will not be fini&s;hed in ten years:&mdash;the public good does not &s;eem much promoted by this means.'</P>
<P>They proceeded on, and &s;aw on one &s;ide of the road a &s;mith's &s;hop. They pau&s;ed to &s;ee if labour was here equally divided. Some iron in the fire was heated to a proper heat, taken out and laid upon the anvil, when the man who was working left it there and marched away. Another took his place, but the welding heat was lo&s;t, and the iron was returned again to the fire.</P>
<P>A man drew near them in deep thought, and the Doctor ventured to inquire the &s;ubject of his reflection. 'I am debating,' replied he, 'whether it will be mo&s;t to the public good, that I &s;hould help half an hour at getting in the harve&s;t, or la|bour half an hour at building the new granary; I have &s;pent all the morning in con&s;idering, and can|not determine.'</P>
<P>'Then it is nece&s;&s;ary to do one?'&mdash;'Yes, it has been proved in a voluminous book of political ju&s;|tice: that, in the old &s;y&s;tem of things, the labour which was performed by a certain number of the lower people, could be done in half an hour's labour

<P>'Taxes,' replied Parecho, 'if within moderation, and not &s;ent out of the country, are like the return|ing moi&s;ture of the dews.'

<P>'It is true,' &s;aid Parecho, with a languid &s;mile, 'that your greate&s;t &s;ticklers for freedom, if they &s;ee their folly, become as great champions for &s;lavery, always in extremes. Under our former govern|ment, which was a limited monarchy, we had every

<P>'A government,' replied Parecho, 'to be invul|nerable again&s;t the attacks of time, and for the be|nefit of every individual, mu&s;t be like a pyramid, ri&s;ing from a broad ba&s;e to a point.

<P>The philo&s;ophers retired to their room, where &s;ome clean &s;traw was laid upon the floor, the beds having been &s;eque&s;tered for the public pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>'It mu&s;t be owned,' &s;aid Frederick, 'the&s;e people are a whim&s;ical &s;et, and do not &s;eem much better for their liberty.'</P>
<P>'This is a philo&s;ophical republic,' &s;aid Alogos; 'the ancient republics were fighting republics;&mdash; the Americans and the Hollanders are trading re|publics, but men &s;eemed neither better &s;atisfied, bet|ter governed, or better fed in any of them; nor in fact, do they enjoy &s;o many benefits as in a limited monarchy.'</P>
<P>'But I in&s;i&s;t upon it,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'monarchy is unnatural. It is one tyrant u&s;urping the privileges of the whole people, contrary to the &s;acred maje&s;ty of the body politic.'</P>

Frederick, 'in as many different definitions; for my part I am di&s;gu&s;ted with every thing.' The&s;e philo&s;ophers were here interrupted by the &s;noring of Mungo, who had quietly laid down upon the &s;traw, untroubled with the nature of truth or metaphy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;itions; and the three great men concluded, that ignorance was in &s;ome mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary to happine&s;s. The next morning, Parecho attended his gue&s;ts to a large hall, where they found a great number of people &s;itting upon benches: in the midd of the hall was a &s;quare platform, railed round &s;imi|lar to a &s;mall &s;tage. There was no ornament to fix the eye, nor any mu&s;ic to catch the ear, a pro|found &s;ilence remained.'</P>
<P>'Why,' &s;aid Alogos to Parecho, 'is the place painted black. Have you no prie&s;ts&mdash;no mu&s;ic?'</P>
<P>'There was once very fine paintings,' &s;aid Pare|cho, 'repre&s;enting the miracles in Egppt and the Wilderne&s;s, but it was feared by the philo&s;ophers that the&s;e &s;ymbols would recall to mind the God of their fathers, which they wi&s;hed to expunge from the human &s;oul.&mdash;We u&s;ed to have fine mu|&s;ic; but the mu&s;icians could not be paid, and the whole art &s;ell rapidily to decay, for who would or could attend to the acquirement of &s;kill, when all their reward was a bare exi&s;tence. As to the old prie&s;ts they were deemed to have en&s;laved the peo|ple, by darkening their minds with &s;uper&s;tition, and indulging them&s;elves in licentiou&s;ne&s;s; &s;o that they were mo&s;t of them de&s;troyed, and the re&s;t mingled with the people.'</P>
<P>A per&s;on now moved from the crowd, and mounting the &s;tage, made an oration for half an hour upon morality, political ju&s;tice, and the great book of Nature, where he a&s;&s;erted every thing was to be learnt that was worth knowing: he concluded
<PB N="207" REF="038973_0218_101284DF81406388">
with declaring again&s;t the power of revealed religi|on, to check the crimes of men, a&s;&s;erting, that mo|rality was every thing, and the light of nature the real &s;tandard of virtue.</P>
<P>The people then waited &s;ome time; and no one el&s;e coming forward, they di&s;per&s;ed to walk in the fields, the day being an holiday.</P>
<P>Our philo&s;ophers likewi&s;e quitted the city, follow|ing at a di&s;tance the orator, who had harangued a|bout morality. They entered a grove of trees where they &s;at down, conver&s;ing on politics. A young woman was walking in the grove, to whom the mor|ali&s;t advanced, and &s;eemed to pre&s;s her to &s;omething &s;he objected. He was proceeding to violence, when a young man &s;prung upon him; they both fell to the ground, but the orator being the &s;tronge&s;t, ro&s;e, and with a long knife &s;tabbed the youth to the heart, and ran away.</P>
<P>'Horrid!' cried Doctor Alogos, 'is there no means of puni&s;hing the mon&s;ter?'</P>
<P>'This man,' &s;aid Parecho, indignantly, 'is a re|former of the people, and &s;uch the con&s;equence of his doctrine. If you de&s;troy in the minds of men the belief of an avenging and infinite Power, you give loo&s;e to every pa&s;&s;ion in the corrupted heart of man.

<P>'Very true,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'that I taught the peo|ple of England. But he might be fined&mdash;no man, or body of men, can have a right to puni&s;h with death.'</P>
<P>'But how will you fine a man who has no prop|erty, and where all are equal&mdash;and what could be

done with the fine? You would &s;oon de&s;troy equal|ity.'</P>
<P>'But you might impri&s;on him,' &s;aid Frederick, 'to prevent his doing the &s;ame again.'</P>
<P>'Impo&s;&s;ible,' replied Parecho.&mdash;'My dear Sir, hear the opinions of our great philo&s;ophers. The body is perpetually changing&mdash;the &s;oul of man be|comes every moment a different being; &s;o that were we to put this man in pri&s;on, to-morrow we &s;hould be confining a totally different being wholly innocent of the crime.'</P>
<P>'Very good,' replied Doctor Alogos, 'the fa&s;h|ionable Mr. Hume has made mo&s;t of the <HI>young</HI> men converts to the&s;e very doctrines in my country. So that, notwith&s;tanding I can recollect a friend or a wife for twenty years back, they are not the &s;ame per&s;ons. I and they are changed, transformed, and renewed, nobody knows how often; and Mr. Hume, who fini&s;hed the e&s;&s;ays, was not the Mr. Hume who wrote the treati&s;e on Human Nature. So Alex|ander the Great, who was the &s;on of Philip of Macedon, was not the Alexander the Great who &s;ubdued Greece by his flatteries, nor him who over|threw the Per&s;ians.'</P>
<P>'Such being the ca&s;e,' &s;aid Parecho, 'it is plain&punc; that there can be no puni&s;hments without they are corporeal, nor any corporeal puni&s;hment without infringing political ju&s;tice: you cannot re&s;tore the injury done to &s;ociety by committing an outrage in the article of puni&s;hment.'</P>
<P>'Then crimes may be done with impunity,' &s;aid Doctor Alogos.</P>
<P>'What a delightful country,' cried Stupeo. 'I will never quit it. The human mind is here in perfect freedom. At length, my dear Frederick, we have found the place where our principles are practicable, where truth and philo&s;ophy &s;hine with

<P>'Would that I were once more in England with my dear Laura, if the children of nature have not murdered her,' &s;aid the Doctor, with a deep &s;igh.</P>
<P>Frederick knew not what to think: his &s;en&s;es frequently contradicted the profound Stupeo, and often led him to think his tutor in the wrong; but the philo&s;ophical di&s;qui&s;itions, the grand doc|trines of the greate&s;t good, and the elegant Ro|mance of Political Ju&s;tice, inclined him again to the new philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Our vagabonds returned to the city, when they became hungry. Stupeo grumbled very much to find only coar&s;e bread and fruits, with clear water. 'Have you no fermented liquors,' &s;aid he, 'no &s;pirits?'</P>
<P>'No,' an&s;wered Parecho: '&s;pirits could not be the univer&s;al drink, independent of the labour to procure them; they are, therefore, unallowable in a &s;tate of equality. At fir&s;t, when they were di&s;tributed according to every one's plea&s;ure, the &s;treets were filled with drunkards. Nature never de&s;igned men to drink liquid fire.'</P>

<P>'What,' replied Parecho, 'rear animals on pur|po&s;e to de&s;troy them. Nature never tells us any &s;uch thing&mdash;we u&s;ed formerly to have excellent oxen, but &s;ince labour has been equally divided, no body will undertake to breed them; and the &s;pecies is become almo&s;t extinct: be&s;ides, no one would take the unplea&s;ant office of butcher, where there was no reward.'</P>

<P>'It is a fal&s;e ta&s;te,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'which has in|troduced animal food: and if we do indulge in it, why not eat it raw?&mdash;Nature, had &s;he intended we &s;hould feed upon dre&s;&s;ed di&s;hes, would have produc|ed animals ready roa&s;ted and boiled.'</P>
<P>'And why not,' &s;aid Parecho, 'have loaves and cakes ready baked, grow upon &s;talks in the field: all this is a deviation from nature, and very ab&s;urd in great philo&s;ophers to follow. But &s;eriou&s;ly, what is this jargon about nature?&mdash;What is na|ture?'</P>
<P>'Why, nature,' an&s;wered Stupeo, 'is that which every man &s;ees with his eyes&mdash;it is vi&s;ible at fir&s;t view to all under&s;tandings&mdash;it is the influence of rational principles impinging upon men, actions palpable to every comprehen&s;ion:&mdash;It is derived from the &s;ingle letter N.&mdash;Take the Latin words na&s;cor, natus, natura, and the French n&eacute; for <HI>born,</HI> analy&s;e them, and you will find that A&s;cor being but a frequentive, Atus a common idiomatic expre&s;&s;ion, Atura the &s;ame, &eacute; the &s;ame, reduces all the&s;e words to the &s;ingle letter N, which offers no &s;en&s;e: re&s;tore the eliptic &s;yllable <HI>ge,</HI> cut off by the u&s;ual tendency of languages to contrac|tion, or to euphony, you have geN-a&s;cor, geN-atu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, geN-atura, geN-&eacute;; in which <HI>gen,</HI> the radical of <HI>generative,</HI> of <HI>kind,</HI> of <HI>beginning,</HI> and of hundreds more, gives a clear &s;en&s;e, and con&s;equently are de|rived

<P>'No; the will of the &s;ex is free, and were it not a matter of policy, no man would marry.'</P>
<P>'That is as it &s;hould be,' &s;aid Stupeo: 'if the rich of the old world knew of this ble&s;&s;ed &s;pot, you would have no rea&s;on to complain of the decay of your people.'</P>

<P>Stupeo made a long oration again&s;t leaving the country, where the new philo&s;ophy completely tri|umphed, prote&s;ting if they had but a little brandy, he would prefer it to any &s;pot on the earth; and Frederick, who was nearly a&s;hamed of his former opinions, con&s;ented to follow the Doctor.</P>

<P>At the&s;e words, Stupeo ca&s;t him&s;elf upon the ground, which was agitated by an earthquake, and exhibited a &s;cene tremendou&s;ly grand.

<P>Frederick revolved in &s;ilence the words of Doctor Alogos&mdash;he &s;huddered at the remembrance of his former actions, and would have openly derelicted from his profe&s;&s;ions, had he not been a&s;hamed of the reproaches of Stupeo, who perpetually declaimed again&s;t that imbecility of mind, which, having once

felt the force of rea&s;on, and the grand light of truth, returned again to &s;uper&s;tition and ignorance.</P>
<P>To the&s;e taunts, Doctor Alogos &s;teadily replied, <HI>that, to &s;ay he had changed his opinion, was only to &s;ay, he was wi&s;er to day than he was ye&s;terday.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII. Stupeo quits the world in a blazing idea&mdash;an unexpected meeting, and the conclu&s;ion of what is not concluded.</HEAD>
<P>DURING many days the&s;e philo&s;ophers wander|ed in the woods, till their ammunition was expend|ed, and their &s;pirits exhau&s;ted. They had no means of making a fire, and had for &s;ome time devoured all their game raw, to the no &s;mall prejudice of a &s;tate of nature&mdash;for even Stupeo him&s;elf allowed, that the idea of provi&s;ions dre&s;&s;ed, was better than the idea of them raw. Their bodies were worn out with fatigue and want; and they were &s;o mi&s;erable, as to de&s;ire death as a relief.</P>
<P>For three days they ta&s;ted nothing but water, and a few berries which grew wild. Their clothes were partly worn from their backs, and the remnants were animated with living multitudes:&mdash;a &s;evere fever burnt in the veins of Frederick, and but for the &s;tea|dy encouragement of the Doctor, he would have &s;unk by the way;&mdash;their beards were grown to philo&s;ophical length, and take them all in all, they appeared truly the vagabond children of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="038973_0232_1012850979BFF750">In this forlorn condition, Stupeo uttered cur&s;es with volubility, arraigning the conduct of Provi|dence, if &s;uch there really were.</P>
<P>Doctor Alogos endeavoured to in&s;pire him with patience, ob&s;erving, that Providence was not to blame, as them&s;elves had wilfully plunged into the wilderne&s;s in &s;earch of an <HI>ignus fatuus.</HI></P>
<P>When they were all nearly at the la&s;t exertion, they were overtaken by a tribe of Indians returning from an expedition again&s;t another tribe; and as they could make no defence, they became pri&s;oners with|out a &s;truggle. The&s;e men of nature having fed them with a pa&s;te of pounded Indian corn, tied their hands behind them, and, notwith&s;tanding they were every moment at the point of fainting, urged them forward in a rapid march&mdash;poor Mungo fell down and expired, with the over-exertion; but his fate did not move with <HI>fal&s;e pity</HI> the callous bo&s;oms of the&s;e children of nature.</P>
<P>Stupeo was almo&s;t di&s;tracted at his condition, though he ob&s;tinately in&s;i&s;ted that pity was a fal&s;e feeling of weakne&s;s in the human heart. Frederick now remembered that Rou&s;&s;eau had &s;aid, 'That <HI>pity</HI> was a natural &s;entiment, which moderates in each individual the activity of &s;elf-love, concurring to the mutual pre&s;ervation of all the &s;pecies. So wonderfully do great philo&s;ophers contradict each other in the grand affair of immutable truth.</P>
<P>On the following day they reached a little Indian village. On &s;etting up the war-whoop, a number of women and children came out to meet them, with &s;creams and yells, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing in variety and &s;ublimi|ty of tone, a chorus of an hundred cats howling by moonlight.</P>
<P>'This is the mu&s;ic of a natural ear,' &s;aid the Doctor&mdash;but Stupeo was too much ab&s;orbed in
<PB N="222" REF="038973_0233_1012850F05BE3318">
his execrations, to reply. The&s;e great men were con|fined in a little hut, and had a plentiful repa&s;t of brui&s;ed Indian wheat and water.&mdash;'After all,' &s;aid Stupeo, 'the&s;e &s;avages are better than men in civ|ilized life; this hut or pri&s;on is whole&s;ome and clean, we are not confined in a loath&s;ome dungeon &mdash;the light of nature is always pure, and the ac|tions of &s;imple men cannot fail to be ju&s;t. We only become mon&s;ters when we condemn each other to eternal flames for a bug-bear, or drag each other to &s;takes for the &s;ake of religion. I am more than ever a &s;ceptic; all exi&s;tence is to my eyes a farce, a folly, an idea. Pain, plea&s;ure, life, death, every thing is an idea, or Hume mu&s;t be wrong.'</P>
<P>While he thus &s;poke to his &s;ilent companions, an hideous howl and continued roar of joy advanced towards them. It was night, and the Indians drew near, dancing in rude figures, with torches of pitch-pine, blazing in the air.</P>
<P>'The&s;e are very &s;ingular ideas,' &s;aid the Doctor; 'if your ideas and my perceptions are alike, we &s;hall have a comfortable idea of roa&s;ting.'</P>
<P>'I maintain,' &s;aid Stupeo:&mdash;the door of the hut at that in&s;tant was opened, and &s;everal black chil|dren of rea&s;on dragged out the mi&s;erable philo&s;o|pher, and bore him triumphantly to a green, in the centre of the village. There they fa&s;tened him to a &s;take, and &s;ticking his body full of pine-knots, &s;et fire to the whole, which con&s;umed the mi&s;erable wretch with the mo&s;t agonizing tortures, while the &s;ons of nature danced around him, mocking his cries, and encouraging their children to dart at him little pointed arrows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Note from Playfair's Hi&s;tory of Jacobini&s;m, page 496&mdash; 'Among&s;t the&s;e pri&s;oners (i. e. 200 whom the new philo&s;o|phers murdered at the grand Chatelet) was a woman who for|merly &s;old flowers, and who in a fit of jealou&s;y, had mutilated her lover, one of the French guards, in a very barbarous and &s;hameful manner.&mdash;She had been condemned, but obtained a re&s;pite for &s;ome time.&mdash;The rage of the murderers was redou|bled on &s;eeing the woman who had thus murdered one of their companions:&mdash;&s;he was tied to a &s;take, her feet nailed to the ground, her brea&s;ts cut off with a &s;abre, and then tortured with lighted torches and pointed in&s;truments, in a more cruel and brutal manner than it would be fit to de&s;cribe.'</P>
<P>The learned may infer that &s;avages are much alike, all over the world.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="038973_0234_101285121705F390">Such was the termination of that enlightened great man, who, while he lived, endeavoured to kindle the world, and &s;et &s;ociety in a flame, but expired him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a blaze.</P>
<P>'Alas!' cried Frederick, in extreme agitation, 'What is man? A being influenced by cruelty and rapine:&mdash;he is wor&s;e than the &s;avage hyena of the de&s;ert, or the untamed tyger of the burning &s;ands. I &s;ee with bitter conviction, that coercion and laws are nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train the arm of de&s;truction and violence: in the imperfect nature of all terrene ex|i&s;tences, no law can be made to deter the wicked, without being a re&s;traint, or in &s;ome in&s;tances, a grievance to &s;ome who are innocent.&mdash;I &s;ee that &s;o|ciety, with all its drawbacks, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the greate&s;t portion of real happine&s;s; and that half our mi&s;e|ries we bring on our&s;elves, by endeavouring to rai&s;e human nature &s;uperior to it&s;elf.'</P>
<P>'I am afraid,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'it will be our turn next. The&s;e wretches are ignorant of the <HI>laws of nations</HI>; and they have not &s;ufficient <HI>religion</HI> to teach them the duties of man to man.'</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e two vagabonds, turncoats, unworthy the great name, or glorious martyrdom of the im|mortal Stupeo, who peri&s;hed in the heat of his own ideas, bewailed the accident of a gentle roa&s;ting.
<PB N="224" REF="038973_0235_10128513C19764F8">
But the Indians had no &s;ooner perfectly reduced the great philo&s;opher, metaphy&s;ician, and politician, to the idea of a few cinders, than they advanced to the cottage, and dragged out the two pri&s;oners to re|new their pa&s;time.</P>
<P>As they approached the &s;takes, they were buffet|ted on every &s;ide by &s;evere blows from the delicate fi&s;ts of the ladies, who out of &s;pite at the fair &s;kin of the dirty, lou&s;y, Frederick, bit and pinched him with a very agreeable and &s;portive air. Indeed, if one might judge by their cries, they were even more de|lighted than the tender European ladies who crowd to &s;ee &s;ome poor wretches extended on a gibbet, or run &s;creaming to contemplate an hou&s;e in flames; or, than the fair daughters of France, who danced the Carmagnole round the guillotine.</P>
<P>While they were tying their victims to the &s;take, and dancing round with their blazing torches, the report of a gun &s;truck them with con&s;ternation, and a loud yell be&s;poke their de&s;pair:&mdash;a &s;econd fire, which &s;ent a bullet whi&s;tling among&s;t them, urged them to flight, and our heroes remained expo&s;ed to whatever might en&s;ue&mdash;a large fire gleamed on one &s;ide of them, by the light of which they perceived &s;everal per&s;ons advancing, dre&s;&s;ed in&punc; frocks, like American hunters.</P>
<P>They drew near with their rifles in their hands, and &s;eemed to &s;tart with a&s;toni&s;hment when they &s;aw two white men naked, and covered with dirt. 'Whoever you are,' &s;aid Frederick, in a doleful voice, 'have <HI>pity</HI> upon our &s;ituation, and relea&s;e us before the&s;e mon&s;ters return.'</P>
<P>'Who are you?' &s;aid one of the &s;trangers, who&s;e hat was adorned with a feather&mdash;'Surely, I am no &s;tranger to your voice.'</P>
<P>'My name is Fredrick Fenton.'</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="038973_0236_10128517F5D989A8">'Frederick Fenton!' exclaimed the &s;tranger; 'O! eternal Providence, what my&s;teries involve us finite beings?&mdash;Ha&s;t thou brought into the wilder|ne&s;s of America 'the man I had mo&s;t rea&s;on to ab|hor, and made me the in&s;trument of his pre&s;erva|tion.

<P>'What,' cried Frederick, 'are you Vernon? Point your rifle at me, and fini&s;h at once the days of a mi&s;creant.'</P>
<P>'No,' replied Vernon; 'it is not for me to wre&s;t vengeance to my&s;elf; but how are you in this &s;itua|tion? <HI>Gratitude</HI> to your father makes me almo&s;t re|joice that I have &s;aved his &s;on.'</P>
<P>'Gratitude,' &s;ighed Frederick. 'Ah, Vernon! had I but felt it more early; had I li&s;tened to the common claims of nature and of &s;ociety, I might have been a worthy member. But the new &s;ophi&s;|ticated jargon of philo&s;ophy and impracticable liber|ty, had rendered me in&s;ane. I have, however, been the pupil of experience, and have &s;een the a&s;hes of Stupeo &s;catterred by the wind.'</P>
<P>'I will return to &s;ociety,' &s;aid Vernon: 'it was the lo&s;s of a woman which embittered it to me, and drove me a forlorn wanderer in the&s;e woods; where I have fortunately found another to &s;upply her lo&s;t, and lead me again into the world.

<P>'She now, I hope, waits us at your plantation,' replied Vernon, 'where I left her to &s;earch for you, in company with the&s;e my friends; though I confe&s;s with very little expectation of finding you.'</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="038973_0237_1012851991CC0F90">'Thou art too good: O Providence!' cried Alogos, &s;hedding tears, 'what is man, that thou art mindful of him?'</P>
<P>'I am glad,' &s;aid Frederick:&mdash;'I feel at this mo|ment more &s;atisfaction than I have felt for years&mdash; &s;urely, there is &s;omething in virtue not be de&s;cribed, &mdash;you will be happy, Vernon, with Laura&mdash;&s;he is formed for you, and I rejoice that I did not &s;ucceed in deba&s;ing her purity.

<P>'Have you heard lately from Europe?' inquired Doctor Alogos. 'Yes,' replied Vernon: 'I have news, that in Frederick's pre&s;ent &s;entiments, will increa&s;e his &s;atisfaction.

<P>'I will fly,' cried Frederick&mdash;'I will ca&s;t my&s;elf at their feet, and implore them to pardon me.'</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a month, they arrived again in Ken|tucky, where they found population increa&s;ing with the numerous emigrations, but unhappine&s;s and di&s;|content prevailed: for though the grounds which were cultivated were productive, there was no chan|nel for trade&mdash;and it &s;ignifies nothing to a farmer, that his harve&s;t is plentiful, if he has no market to meet his commodities.</P>
<P>Taxes increa&s;ed, and every man was obliged to learn the military exerci&s;e, and keep in check the predatory Indians.</P>
<P>Doctor Alogos remarked, that the people of America was equally di&s;&s;atisfied with the people of England; and &s;aw clearly, that no government would be univer&s;ally approved, which was not to the exact model and intere&s;t of <HI>every</HI> private individual.</P>
