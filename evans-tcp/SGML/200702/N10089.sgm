<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you allow me the honour of your corre&s;pondence, I may not omit ac|quainting you with &s;o remarkable an event as the withdraw of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms and mo&s;t of the other officers under them from the town on board the Romney, with an intent to remote from thence to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 10th a &s;loop belong|ing to Mr. Hancock, a repre&s;entative for Bo&s;ton, and a wealthy merchant, of great influence over the populace, was &s;eized by the collector and comptroller for a very notorious breach of the acts of trade, and, after &s;eizure, taken into cu&s;to|dy by the officer of the Romney man of war, and remov'd under command of her guns. It is pretended that the removal and not the &s;eizure
<PB N="4" REF="012818_0003_0F90908997DAA4C8">
incen&s;ed the people. It &s;eems not very ma|terial which it was&mdash;A mob was immediately rais'd, the officers in&s;ulted, bruis'd and much hurt, and the windows of &s;ome of their hou&s;es broke; a boat belonging to the collector burnt in triumph, and many threats utter'd again&s;t the commi&s;&s;ioners and their officers: no notice being taken of their extravagance in the time of it, nor any endeavours by any authority except the governor, the next day to di&s;cover and puni&s;h the offenders; and there being a rumour of a higher mob intended monday (the 13th) in the evening the commi&s;&s;ioners, <HI>four of them,</HI> thought them&s;elves altogether un&s;afe, being de&s;titute of protection, and remov'd with their families to the Romney, and there remain and hold their board, and next week intend to do the &s;ame, and al&s;o open the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e at the ca&s;tle. The go|vernor pre&s;s'd the council to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their advice, but they declin'd and evaded calling it a bru&s;h or &s;mall di&s;turbance by boys and negroes, not con&s;idering <HI>how much it mu&s;t be re&s;ented in England</HI> that the officers of the crown &s;hould think them&s;elves obliged to quit the place of their residence and go on board a King's &s;hip for &s;afety, and all the internal authority of the pro|vince take no notice, of it&mdash;The town of Bo&s;ton have had repeated meetings, and by their votes declared the commi&s;&s;ioners and their officers a great grievance, and ye&s;terday in&s;tructed their repre&s;entatives to endeavor that enquiry &s;hould be made by the a&s;&s;embly whether any per&s;on by writing or in any other way had encouraged the &s;ending troops here, there being &s;ome alarm|ing reports that troops are expected, but have

not taken any mea&s;ures to di&s;countenance the promoters of the late proceedings; but on the contrary appointed one or more of the actors or abettors on a committee appointed to wait on the governor, and to de&s;ire him to order the man of war out of the harbour.</P>
<P>Ignorant as they be, yet the heads of a Bo&s;ton town-meeting influences all publick mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible this anarchy &s;hould la&s;t al|ways. Mr. Hallowell who will be the bearer of this tells me he has the honour of being per|&s;onally known to you. I beg leave to refer you to him for a more full account.</P>

<P>IT is very nece&s;&s;ary other information &s;hould be had in England of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms than what common fame will bring to you or what you will receive from mo&s;t of the letters which go from hence, people in general being prejudiced by many fal&s;e reports and mi&s;repre&s;entations concerning them. Seven eighths of the people of the country &s;up|po&s;e the board it&s;elf to be uncon&s;titutional and cannot be undeceived and brought to believe that a board has exi&s;ted in England all this cen|tury, and that the board e&s;tabli&s;hed here has no

new powers given to it. Our incendiaries know it but they indu&s;triou&s;ly and very wickedly pub|li&s;h the contrary. As much pains has been ta|ken in prejudice the country again&s;t the per&s;ons of the commi&s;&s;ioners and their characters have been mi&s;repre&s;ented and cruelly treated e&s;peci|ally &s;ince their confinement at the ca&s;tle where they are not &s;o likely to hear what is &s;aid of them and are not &s;o able to confute it.</P>
<P>It is now pretended they need not to have withdrawn, that Mr. Williams had &s;tood his ground without any injury although the mob be|&s;et his hou&s;e, &amp;c. There never was that &s;pirit rai&s;ed again&s;t the under officers as again&s;t the commi&s;&s;ioners, <HI>I mean four of them.</HI> They had a public affront offered them, by the town of Bo&s;ton who refu&s;ed to give the u&s;e of their hall for a public dinner unle&s;s it was &s;tipulated that the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould not be invited. An affront of the &s;ame nature at the motion of Mr. Hancock was offered by a company of cadets. Soon after a ve&s;&s;el of Mr. Hancock's being &s;eiz|ed the officers were mobb'd and the commi&s;&s;ion|ers were informed they were threatned. I own I was in pain for them. I do not believe if the mob had &s;eized them, there was any authority able and willing to have re&s;cued them. After they had withdrawn the town &s;ignified to the go|vernor by a me&s;&s;age that it was expected or de&s;i|red they &s;hould not returp. It was then the ge|neral voice that it would not be &s;afe for them to return. After all this the &s;ons of liberty &s;ay they de&s;erted or abdicated.</P>
<P>The other officers of the cu&s;toms in general either did not leave the town or &s;oon returned to

it. Some of them &s;eem to be di&s;contented with the commi&s;&s;ioners. Great pains have been taken to increa&s;e the di&s;content. Their office by the&s;e means is rendered extremely burden&s;ome. Eve|ry thing they do is found fault with, and yet no particular illegality or even irregularity men|tioned. There is too much hauteur &s;ome of their officers &s;ay in the treatment they receive. They &s;ay they treat their officers as the commi&s;|&s;ioners treat their officers in England and re|quire no greater deference. After all it is not the per&s;ons but the office of the commi&s;&s;ioners which has rai&s;ed this &s;pirit, and the di&s;tinction made between the commi&s;&s;ioners is becau&s;e it has been given out that four of them were in favor of the new e&s;tabli&s;hment and the <HI>fifth was not.</HI> If Mr. Hallowell arrived &s;afe he can in|form you many circum&s;tances relative to this di&s;|tinction which I very willingly excu&s;e my&s;elf from mentioning.</P>
<P>I know of no burden brought upon the fair trader by the new e&s;tabli&s;hment. The illicit trader finds the ri&s;que greater than it u&s;ed to be, e&s;pecially in the port where the board is con|&s;tantly held. Another circum&s;tance which in|crea&s;es the prejudice is this; the new duties hap|pened to take place ju&s;t about the time the com|mi&s;&s;ioners arrived. People have ab&s;urdly con|nected the duties and board of commi&s;&s;ioners, and &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould have had no additional duties if there had been no board to have the charge of collecting them. With all the aid you can give to the officers of the crown they will have enough to do to maintain the authority of government and to carry the laws into execution.

If they are di&s;countenanced, neglected or fail of &s;upport from you, they mu&s;t &s;ubmit to every thing the pre&s;ent oppo&s;ers of government think fit to require of them.</P>
<P>There is no office under greater di&s;courage|ments than that of the commi&s;&s;ioners. Some of my friends recommended me to the mini&s;try. I think my&s;elf very happy that I am not one.

<P>From my acquaintance with the commi&s;&s;ioners I have received a per&s;onal e&s;teem for them, but my chief inducement to make this repre&s;enta|tion to you is a regard to the public intere&s;t which I am &s;ure will &s;uffer if the oppo&s;ition carry their point again&s;t them.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS ab&s;ent upon one of our circuits when Mr. Byles arrived. Since my return I have re|ceived from him your obliging letter of 31&s;t July. I never dared to think what the re&s;entment of the nation would be upon Hallowell's arrival. It is not &s;trange that mea&s;ures &s;hould be imme|diately taken to reduce the colonies to their former &s;tate of government and order, but that the national funds &s;hould be affected by it is to me a little my&s;terious and &s;urprizing. Princi|ples of government ab&s;urd enough &s;pread thro' all the colonies; but I cannot think that in any colony, people of any con&s;ideration have ever been &s;o mad as to think of a revolt. Many of the common people have been in a frenzy, and talk'd of dying in defence of their liberties, and have &s;poke and printed what is highly criminal, and too many of rank above the vulgar, and &s;ome <HI>in public po&s;ts</HI> have countenanced and encouraged them untill they increa&s;ed &s;o much in their num|bers and in their opinion of their importance as to &s;ubmit to government no further than they thought proper. The legi&s;lative powers have been influenced by them, and the executive powers intirely lo&s;t their force. There has been continual danger of mobs and in&s;urrections, but they would have &s;pent all their force within our&s;elves, the officers of the Crown and &s;ome of the few friends who dared to &s;tand by them po&s;&s;ibly might have been knock'd in the head, and &s;ome &s;uch fatal event would probably have
<PB N="10" REF="012818_0009_0F90915F56785D78">
brought the people to their &s;en&s;es. For four or five weeks pa&s;t the di&s;temper has been growing, and I confe&s;s I have not been without &s;ome apprehen&s;ions for my&s;elf, but my friends have had more for me, and I have had repeated and frequent notices from them from different quar|ters, <HI>one of the la&s;t I will inclo&s;e to you.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the following Letter.</NOTE> In this &s;tate of things there was no &s;ecurity but quitting my po&s;ts, which nothing but the la&s;t extremity would ju&s;tify. As chief ju&s;tice for two years after our fir&s;t di&s;orders I kept the grand juries tollerably well to their duty. The la&s;t &s;pring there had been &s;everal riots, and a mo&s;t infamous libel had been publi&s;hed in one of the papers, which I enlarged upon, and the grand jury had determined to make pre&s;entments, but the attorney-general not attending them the fir&s;t day, Otis and his creatures who were alarm|ed and frightned exerted them&s;elves the next day and prevailed upon &s;o many of the jury to change their voices, that there was not a &s;ufficient number left to find a bill. They have been ever &s;ince more enraged again&s;t me than ever. At the de&s;ire of the governor I committed to writing the charge while it lay in my memory, and as I have no further u&s;e for it I will inclo&s;e it as it may give you &s;ome idea of our judicatories.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were in this &s;tate, news came of two regiments being ordered from Halifax, and &s;oon after two more from Ireland. The minds of people were more and more agitated, broad hints were given that the troops &s;hould never land, a barrel of tar was placed upon the bacon, in the night to be fired to bring in the country when the
<PB N="11" REF="012818_0010_0F90915FF98D69E8">
troops appeared, and all the authority of the government was not &s;trong enough to remove it. The town of Bo&s;ton met and pa&s;&s;ed a number of weak but very criminal votes; and as the go|vernor declined calling an a&s;&s;embly they &s;ent circular letters to all the towns and di&s;tricts to &s;end a per&s;on each that there might be a general con&s;ultation at &s;o extraordinary a cri&s;is. They met and &s;pent a week, made them&s;elves ridicu|lous, and then di&s;&s;olv'd them&s;elves. after a me&s;|&s;age or two to the governor which he refu&s;ed to receive; a petition to the King which I dare &s;ay <HI>their agent</HI> will never be allow'd to pre&s;ent, and a re&s;ult which they have publi&s;hed ill-natured and impotent.</P>
<P>In this confu&s;ion the troops from Halifax ar|rived. I never was much afraid of the people's taking arms, but I was apprehen&s;ive of violence from the mob, it being their la&s;t chance before the troops could land. As the pro&s;pect of re|venge became more certain their courage abated in proportion. Two regiments are landed, but a new grievance is now rais'd. The troops are by act of parliament to be quartered no where el&s;e but in the barracks untill they are full. There are barracks enough at the ca&s;tle to hold both regiments. It is therefore again&s;t the act to bring any of them into town. This was &s;tarted by the council in their an&s;wer to the governor, which to make them&s;elves popular, they in an unprecedented way publi&s;hed and have alarmed all the province; for although none but the mo&s;t contracted minds could put &s;uch a con&s;truction upon the act, yet after this declaration of the council nine tenths of the people &s;uppo&s;e it ju&s;t.
<PB N="12" REF="012818_0011_0F90916344396BC0">
I wi&s;h the act had been better expre&s;s'd, but it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e the parliament intended to take from the King the direction of his forces by confining them to a place where any of the co|lonies might think fit to build, barracks. It is be&s;ides ungrateful, for it is known many that this provi&s;ion was brought into the bill after it had been framed without it, from meer favor to the colonies. I hear the commander in chief has provided barracks or quarters, but a doubt &s;till remains with &s;ome of the council, whether they are to furni&s;h the articles required, unle&s;s the men are in the province barracks, and they are to determine upon it to day.</P>
<P>The government has been &s;o long in the hands of the populace that it mu&s;t come out of them by degrees, at lea&s;t it will be a work of time to bring the people back to ju&s;t notions of the nature of government.</P>

<P>I AM ju&s;t now informed that a number of the council, perhaps 8 or 10, who live in and bear this town, have met together and agreed upon a long addre&s;&s; or petition to parliament, and that it will be &s;ent by this &s;hip to Mr. Bollan to be pre|&s;ented. Mr. Danforth who is pre&s;ident of the council told the governor upon enquiry, that it was &s;ent to him to &s;ign, and he &s;uppo&s;ed the re&s;t of the council who had met together would &s;ign after him in order, but he hath &s;ince found that they had wrote over hi&s; name <HI>by order of council,</HI> which makes it appear to be an act of council. This may be a low piece of cunnihg in him, but be it as it may, it's proper it &s;hould be known that the whole is no more than the doings of a part of the council only, although even that is not very material, &s;ince, if they had all been pre&s;ent with|out the governor's &s;ummons the meeting would have been irregular and uncon&s;titutional, and ought to be di&s;countenanced and cen&s;ured. I &s;uppose there is no in&s;tance of the privy council's meeting and doing bu&s;iness without the king's pre&s;ence or &s;pecial direction, except in commit|tees upon &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s as by his maje&s;ty's order has been re&s;erv'd to them by an act of council, and I have known no in&s;tance here without the governor until within three or four months pa&s;t.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have laid me under very great obliga|tions by the very clear and full account of proceedings in parliament, which I received from you by Capt. Scott. You have al&s;o done much &s;ervice to the people of the province. For a day or two after the &s;hip arrived, the enemies of government gave out that their friends in parlia|ment were increa&s;ing, and all things would be &s;oon on the old footing; in other words that all acts impo&s;ing duties would be repealed, the com|mi&s;&s;ioners board di&s;&s;olved, the cu&s;toms put on the old footing, and <HI>illicit</HI> trade be carried on with little of no hazard. It was very fortunate that I had it in my power to prevent &s;uch a fal&s;e re|pre&s;entation from &s;preading through the province. I have been very cautious of u&s;ing your name, but I have been very free in publi&s;hing abroad the &s;ub&s;tance of your letter, and declaring that I had my intelligence from the be&s;t authority, and have in a great mea&s;ure defeated the ill de|&s;ign in rai&s;ing and attempting to &s;pread &s;o ground|le&s;s a report. What marks of re&s;entment the parliament will &s;how, whether they will be up|on the province in general or particular per&s;ons, is extremely uncertain, but that they will be pla|ced &s;omewhere is mo&s;t certain, and I add, becau&s;e <HI>I think it ought to be &s;o,</HI> that tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t &s;teady in pre&s;erving the con&s;titution and oppo&s;ing the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch as call them&s;elves &s;ons of liberty will certainly meet with favor and encouragement.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM indebted to you for the obliging manner in which you receiv'd my recommendation of my good friend Mr. Paxton, as well as for the account you are plea&s;ed to &s;end me of the &s;itua|tion of affairs in the mother country.</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry that the colonies give you &s;o much employment, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how long it will be before things &s;ettle into quiet among us. We have &s;ome here who have been &s;o bu&s;y in &s;omething the late di&s;turbances, that may now think it needful for their own &s;e|curity to keep up the &s;pirit. They have plumed them&s;elves much upon the victory they have gamed, and the &s;pport they have &s;ince met with; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> could my thing better &s;how what they would &s;till be a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> than the manner in which by their own account publi&s;hed in the news-papers la&s;t Augu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> celebrated the 14th of that month, as the fir&s;t anniver&s;ary commemoration of what they
<PB N="19" REF="012818_0018_0F909169BA2C49C8">
had done at the tree of liberty on that day the year before. Here a number of re&s;pectable gentlemen as they inform us now met, and a|mong other toa&s;ts drank general Paoli, and the &s;park of liberty kindled in Spain, I am now &s;peaking of a few individuals only, the body of the people are well di&s;po&s;ed, yet when you come to &s;ee the journal of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, I fear you will think that the &s;ame &s;pirit has &s;eized our public coun&s;els. I can however fairly &s;ay thus much in behalf of the government, that the la&s;t hou&s;e was packed by means of a public pro&s;cription ju&s;t before the election, of the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who had appeared in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion in the &s;upport of government: their names were publi&s;hed in an inflammatory news-paper, and their con&s;titu|ents made to believe they were about to &s;ell them for &s;laves. Writs are now out for a new a&s;&s;em|bly, but I cannot an&s;wer for the choice: I hope however that the people in general are in a better temper; yet the moderate men have been &s;o browbeaten in the hou&s;e, and found them&s;elves &s;o in&s;ignificant there the la&s;t year, that &s;ome of them will voluntarily decline coming again. I think this looks too much like a de&s;pair of the common-wealth, and cannot be ju&s;tified on pa|triotic principles.</P>
<P>The election of coun&s;ellors was carried the la&s;t year as might have been expected from &s;uch an hou&s;e. The officers of the crown and the judges of the &s;uperior court were excluded. And I hear that it is the de&s;ign of &s;ome who expect to be returned members of the hou&s;e this year to make &s;ure work at the en&s;uing election of coun|&s;ellors,
<PB N="20" REF="012818_0019_0F90916ACF9184F8">
by excluding, if they can, the gentlemen of the council (who by charter remain &s;uch 'till others are cho&s;en in their room) from any &s;hare in the choice, tho' they have always had their voice in it hitherto from the fir&s;t arrival of the charter. If the hou&s;e do this, they will have it in their power to model the council as they plea&s;e, and throw all the powers of government into the hands of the people, unle&s;s the governor &s;hould again exert his negative as he did the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>You have doubtle&s;s &s;een &s;ome of the curious me&s;&s;ages from the late hou&s;e to the governor, and can't but have ob&s;erved with how little decency they have attacked both the governor and the lieutenant governor. They have al&s;o in effect forced the council to declare them&s;elves parties in the quarrel they had again&s;t the latter in a matter of mere indifference. In their me&s;&s;age to the governor of the 31&s;t of January they have explicitly charged the lieutenant governor (a gentleman to whom they are more indebted than to any one man in the government) with "ambition and lu&s;t of power", merely for pay|ing a compliment to the governor agreeable to ancient u&s;age, by attending him to court and being pre&s;ent in the council chamber when he made his &s;peech at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, at which time they go on to &s;ay, "none but the general court and their &s;ervants are intended to be pre&s;ent", &s;till holding out to the people the &s;ervants, of the crown as objects of in&s;ignificance, ranking the &s;ecretary with their door-keeper, as &s;ervants of the a&s;&s;embly; for the &s;ecretary with his clerks and the door-keeper are the only
<PB N="21" REF="012818_0020_0F90916E689A0EE8">
per&s;ons pre&s;ent with the a&s;&s;embly on the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The officers of the crown being thus le&s;&s;en'd in the eyes of the people, takes off their weight and influence, and the balance will of cour&s;e turn in favor of the people, and what makes them &s;till more in&s;ignificant is their dependance on the people for a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport: If &s;ome|thing were left to the goodwill of the people, yet nature &s;hould be &s;ure of a &s;upport. The governor's &s;alary has for about 35 years pa&s;t been pretty well under&s;tood to be a thou&s;and pound a year &s;terling. When this &s;um was fir&s;t agreed to, it was very well; but an increa&s;e of wealth &s;ince hat brought along with it an increa&s;e of luxury, &s;o that what was &s;ufficient to keep up a proper di&s;tinction and &s;upport the dignity of a governor then, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in|&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e now. The lieutenant governor has no appointments as &s;uch: the cap|taincy of Ca&s;tle-William which may be worth &pound;. 120 &s;terling a year is looked upon indeed as an appendage to his commi&s;&s;ion, and the late lieu|tenant governor enjoyed no other appointment: he lived a retired life upon his own e&s;tate in the country, and was ea&s;y. The pre&s;ent lieutenant governor indeed has other appointments, but the people are quarrelling with him for it, and will not &s;uffer him to be ea&s;y unle&s;s he will retire al&s;o.</P>
<P>The &s;ecretary may have &s;omething <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> than &pound;.200 a year &s;terling, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> has for the two la&s;t years been allowed &pound;.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> lawful money a year le&s;s than had been u&s;ual for divers years preced|ing, tho' he had convinced the hou&s;e by their committee that without this deduction he would
<PB N="22" REF="012818_0021_0F90916FEA42C960">
have had no more than &pound;.250 &s;terling per annum in fees, perqui&s;ites and &s;alary altogether, which is not the one half of his annual expence.</P>
<P>The crown did by charter re&s;erve to it&s;elf the appointment of a governor, lieutenant governor and &s;ecretary on the de&s;ign of this was without doubt to maintain &s;ome kind of balance between the powers of the crown and of the people; but if officers are not in &s;ome mea&s;ure independent of the people (for it is difficult to &s;erve two ma&s;ters) they will &s;ometimes have a hard &s;truggle between duty to the crown and a regard to &s;elf, which mu&s;t be a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation to them, as well as a weakening to the authority of government. The officers of the crown are very few, and are therefore the more ea&s;ily provided for without burdening the people: <HI>and &s;uch pro|vi&s;ion I look upon as nece&s;&s;ary to the re&s;toration and &s;upport of the King's authority.</HI></P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid how can any new mea&s;ures be taken without rai&s;ing new di&s;turbances? The manufacturers in England will ri&s;e again and de|feat the mea&s;ures of government. This game 'tis true has been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and &s;ucceeded, and it has been a&s;&s;erted here, that it is in the power of the colonies at any time to rai&s;e a rebellion in England by refu&s;ing to &s;end for their manu|factures. For my own part I do not believe this. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in England, and I don't know <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in London and Bri&s;tol only, might al|ways govern in this matter and quiet the manu|facturer. The merchant's view is always to his own intere&s;t. As the trade is now managed, the dealer here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to the merchant in England for his goods; upon the&s;e goods the Engli&s;h mer|chant
<PB N="23" REF="012818_0022_0F90917100D253C0">
puts a profit of 10 or more probably of 15 per cent when he &s;ends them to his employer in America. The merchant is &s;o jealous of fore|going this profit, that an American trader cannot well purcha&s;e the goods he wants of the manu|facturer; for &s;hould the merchant know that the manufacturer had &s;upplied an American, he would take off no more of his wares. The merchants therefore having this profit in view will by one means or other &s;ecure it. They know the goods which the American market demands, and may therefore &s;afely take them off from the manu|facturer, tho' they &s;hould have no orders for &s;hipping them this year or perhaps the next; and I dare &s;ay, it would not be longer before the Americans would clamour for a &s;upply of goods from England, for it is vain to think they can &s;upply them&s;elves. The merchant might then put in advanced price upon his goods, and po&s;&s;i|bly be able to make his own terms; or if it &s;hould be thought the goods would not bear an advanced price to indemnify him&punc; it might be worth while for the government to agree with the merchants before hand to allow them a premium equivalent to the advance of their &s;tock, and <HI>then the game would be over.</HI></P>

<P>I AM this moment favored with your very ob|liging letter by Capt. Jarvis of the 2d March, which I have but ju&s;t time to acknowledge, as this is the day given out for the &s;hip to &s;ail. I wrote you the end of February in reply to your letter of the 28th December, that of the 12th February which you refer to in this of the 2d of March is not yet come to hand. You lay me, &s;ir, under the greate&s;t obligations as well for the intere&s;ting account of public affairs which you are from time to time plea&s;ed to tran&s;mit me; as for your &s;teady attention to my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> concerns. I &s;hall always have the mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of Mr. Grenville's intentions of favor al&s;o, whether I ever reap any benefit from them or nor. With|out a proper &s;upport afforded to the king's officers,
<PB N="25" REF="012818_0024_0F909171FA3473A0">
the re&s;pect due to government will of cour&s;e fail; yet I cannot &s;ay whether under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and con&s;idering the temper the people are now in, an additional provi&s;ion for me would be of real benefit to me per&s;onally or not. It has been given out that no per&s;on who receives a &s;tipend from the government at home, &s;hall live in the country. Government here wants &s;ome <HI>effectual</HI> &s;upport: No &s;ooner was it known that the lieut. governor had a provi&s;ion of &pound;.200 a year made for him out of the revenue, than he was advi&s;ed in the Bo&s;ton Gazette to re&s;ign all preten&s;ions to a &s;eat in council, either with or without a voice. The temper of the people may be &s;urely learnt from that infamous paper; it is the very thing that forms their temper; for it they are not in the temper of the writer at the time of the publication, yet it is looked upon as the ORACLE, and they &s;oon bring their temper to it. Some of the late&s;t of them are very expre&s;|&s;ive, I will not trouble you with &s;ending them, as I imagine they &s;omehow or other find their way to you: But I cannot but apprehend from the&s;e papers and from hints that are thrown out, that if the petition of the Hou&s;e to his Maje&s;ty and their letters to divers noble Lords &s;hould fail of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ome people will be mad enough to go to extremities. The commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms have already been openly affronted, the governor's company of Cadets have come to a re&s;olution not to wait on him (as u&s;ual) on the day of General Election the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in&s;tant if tho&s;e gentlemen are of the company. And the Town of Bo&s;ton have pa&s;&s;ed a Vote that Faneu|il-Hall (in which the governor and his company
<PB N="26" REF="012818_0025_0F909172C4496598">
u&s;ually dine on that day) &s;hall not be opened to him if the commi&s;&s;ioners are invited to dine with him. A li&s;t of coun&s;ellors has within a few days pa&s;t been printed and di&s;per&s;ed by way of &s;neer on Lord Shelburne's letter, made up of king's officers; which li&s;t, the writer &s;ays, if adopted at the next general election may take away all grounds of complaint, and may po&s;&s;ibly prove a healing and very &s;alutarv mea&s;ure. The lieutenant governor is at the head of this li&s;t, they have done me the honor to put me next, the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms are all in the li&s;t except <HI>Mr. Temple,</HI> and to compleat the li&s;t, they have added &s;ome of the waiters. I never thought 'till very lately that they acted upon any <HI>&s;ettled plan,</HI> nor do I now think they have 'till of late; a few, a very few, among us have planned the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, and the govern|ment has been too weak to &s;ubdue their turbu|lent &s;pirits.

<P>As to the appointment of the council, I am of opinion that neither the popular elections in this province, nor their appointment in what are called the royal governments by the King's man|damus, are free from exceptions, e&s;pecially if the council as a legi&s;lative body is intended to an&s;wer the idea of the hou&s;e of lords in the Briti&s;h le|gi&s;lature. There they are &s;uppos'd to be a free and independent body, and on their being &s;uch the &s;trength and firmne&s;s of the con&s;titution does very much depend: whereas the election or ap|pointment of the councils in the manner before mentioned renders them altogether dependent on their con&s;tituents. The King is the fountain of honour, and as &s;uch the peers of the realm derive their honours from him; but then they hold them by a &s;urer tenure than the provincial coun|&s;ellors who are appointed by mandamus. On

the other hand, our popular elections very often expo&s;e them to contempt; for nothing is more common, than for the repre&s;entatives, when they find the council a little untractable at the clo&s;e of the year, to remind them that May is at hand.</P>
<P>It may be accounted by the colonies as dan|gerous to admit of any alterations in their charters, as it is by the governors in the church to make any in the e&s;tabli&s;hment; yet to make the re|&s;emblance as near as may be to the Briti&s;h par|liament, &s;ome alteration is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is not requi&s;ite that I know of, that a coun&s;ellor &s;hou'd be a freeholder; his re&s;idence according to the charter is a &s;ufficient qualifica|tion; for that provides only, that he be an inha|bitant of or proprietor of lands within the di&s;trict for which he is cho&s;en: whereas the peers of the realm &s;it in the hou&s;e of lords, as I take it, in virtue of their baronies. If there &s;hould be a reform of any of the colony charters with a view to keep up the re&s;emblance of the three e&s;tates in England, the legi&s;lative council &s;hou'd con&s;i&s;t of men of landed e&s;tates; but as our landed e&s;tates here are &s;mall at pre&s;ent, the yearly value of &pound;. 100 &s;terling per annum might in &s;ome of them at lea&s;t be a &s;ufficient qualification. As our e&s;tates are partable after the decea&s;e of the pro|prietor, the honour could not be continued in families as in England: It might however be con|tinued in the appointee <HI>quam diu bene &s;e ge&s;&s;erit,</HI> and proof be required of &s;ome mal-practice be|fore a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or removal. Bankruptcy al&s;o might be another ground for removal. A &s;mall legi&s;lative council might an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of government; but it might tend to weaken that

levelling principle, which is cheri&s;h'd by the pre|&s;ent popular con&s;titution, to have an honorary order e&s;tabli&s;h'd, out of which the council &s;hou'd be appointed. There is no way now to put a man of fortune above the common level, and exempt him from being cho&s;en by the people into the lower offices, but his being appointed a ju&s;tice of the peace; this is frequently done when there is no kind of expectation of his undertak|ing the tru&s;t, and has its inconveniences. For remedy hereof it might be expedient to have an order of Patricians or E&s;quires in&s;tituted, to be all men of fortune or good landed e&s;tates, and appointed by the governor with the advice of council, and enroll'd in the &s;ecretary's office, who &s;hou'd be exempted from the lower offices in government as the ju&s;tices now are; and to have the legi&s;lative council (<HI>which in the fir&s;t in&s;tance might be nominated by the Crown</HI>) from time to time fill'd up, as vacancies happen out of this order of men, who, if the order con&s;i&s;ted only of men of landed e&s;tates, might elect, as the Scotti&s;h peers do, only re&s;erving to the King's governor a negative on &s;uch choice. The King in this ca&s;e wou'd be &s;till acknowledged as the fountain of honour, as having in the fir&s;t in&s;tance the appointment of the per&s;ons enroll'd, out of whom the council are to be cho&s;en, and finally having a negative on the choice. Or, the King might have the immediate appointment by man|damus as at pre&s;ent in the royal governments. As the gentlemen of the council would rank above the body from which they are taken, they might bear a title one degree above that of e&s;quire. Be&s;ides this legi&s;lative council, a privy council

Your right honorable friend I tru&s;t will not be offended if I call him mine&mdash; I am &s;ure you will not when I term you &s;uch&mdash; I have &s;ettled it for a long time in my own mind that without a repre&s;entation in the &s;upreme le|gi&s;lature, there cannot be that union between the head and the members as to produce a healthful con&s;titution of the whole body. I have doubted whether this union could be perfected by the fir&s;t experiment. The plan here exhibited &s;eems to be formed in generous and moderate princi|ples, and bids the faire&s;t of any I have yet &s;een to be adopted. Such a great de&s;ign may as in painting require frequent touching before it be|comes a piece highly fini&s;h'd; and after all may require the miliorating hand of time to make it plea&s;e univer&s;ally. Thus the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion

I wi&s;h to hear how it is receiv'd in the hou&s;e of commons. I find by the publications both of governor Pownall and Mr. Bollan, that they each of them adopt the idea of an union and repre|&s;entation, and I think it mu&s;t more and more prevail. The argument again&s;t it from local in|conveniency, mu&s;t as it appears to me be more than balanc'd by greater inconveniencies on the other &s;ide the que&s;tion, the great difficulty will be in the terms of union.&mdash;I add no more, as I fear I have already tre&s;pa&s;s'd much on your time and patience, but that I am,</P>

<P>I HAVE been in this city for &s;ome time pa&s;t executing (with others) his Maje&s;ty's com|mi&s;&s;ion for &s;ettling the boundary between this province and that of New-Jer&s;ey. I left Bo&s;ton the 11th July, &s;ince which my advices from London have come to me very imperfect: but as my friend Mr. Thomp&s;on writes me that he had drawn up my ca&s;e and with your approba|tion laid it before the D. of Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">n, I think it
<PB N="34" REF="012818_0033_0F90917C855D0FE8">
needful once more to mention this bu&s;ine&s;s to you.</P>
<P>There was a time when I thought the autho|rity of government might have been ea&s;ily re|&s;tored; but while it's friends and the officers of the crown are left to an abject dependance on the&s;e very people who are <HI>undermining it's au|thority;</HI> and while the&s;e are &s;uffered not only to go unpuni&s;hed, but on the contrary meet with all kind of &s;upport and encouragement, it cannot be expected that you will ever again recover that re&s;pect which the colonies had been wont to pay to the parent &s;tate. Government at home will deceive it&s;elf, if it imagines that the taking off the duty on gla&s;s, paper and painter's colors will work a reconciliation, and nothing more than this, as I can learn, is propo&s;ed in Ld. H's late cir|cular letter. It is the principle that is now di&s;|puted; the combination again&s;t importation ex|tends to tea, although it comes cheaper than ever, as well as to the other forementioned articles. In Virginia it is extended lately to wines; and I have heard one of the fir&s;t leaders in the&s;e mea|&s;ures in Bo&s;ton &s;ay, that we &s;hould never be upon a proper footing 'till all the revenue acts from the 15th Charles 2d were repealed. Our a&s;&s;embly in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts may have been more illiberal than others in their public me&s;&s;ages and re&s;olves; yet we have &s;ome people among us &s;till who dare to &s;peak in favor of government: But here I do not find &s;o much as one, unle&s;s it be &s;ome of the King's &s;ervants&punc; and yet my bu|&s;ine&s;s here leads me to a&s;&s;ociate with the be&s;t. They univer&s;ally approve of the combination again&s;t importing of goods from Great-Britain,
<PB N="35" REF="012818_0034_0F90917D4D76A3D8">
unle&s;s the revenue acts are repealed, which ap|pears to me little le&s;s than a&s;&s;uming a negative on all acts of parliament which they do not like! They &s;ay expre&s;ly, we are bound by none made &s;ince our emigration, but &s;uch as for our own convenience we choo&s;e to &s;ubmit to; &s;uch for in&s;tance as that for e&s;tabli&s;hing a po&s;t-office. The Bill of Rights and the Habeas Corpus Acts, they &s;ay are only declaratory of the common law which we brought with us.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch circum&s;tance as the&s;e, why &s;hould I wi&s;h to expo&s;e my&s;elf to popular re&s;entment? Were I to receive any thing out of the revenue. I mu&s;t expect to be abu&s;ed for it. Nor do I find that our chief ju&s;tice has received the &pound;.200 granted him for that &s;ervice; and yet the a&s;&s;em|bly have this year withheld his u&s;ual grant, mo&s;t probably becau&s;e he has &s;uch a warrant from the crown.</P>
<P>With regard to my negociations with Mr. Ro|gers, I did in conformity to your opinion make an apology to Mr. Secretary Pownall for men|tioning it, and there &s;ubmitted it. I hear it has been &s;ince talk'd of; but unle&s;s I could be a&s;&s;ur|ed in one &s;hape or other of &pound;.300 per annum, with the other office, I would not chu&s;e to quit what I have. I have no ambition to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, if I am only to be held up as a mark of popular envy or re&s;entment. I was in hopes before now through the intervention of your good offices to have received &s;ome mark of favor from your good friend; but the time is not yet come to expect it through that channel! I will

however rely on your friend&s;hip, whenever you can with propriety appear in forwarding my in|tere&s;t, or preventing any thing that may prove injurious to it.</P>
<P>If Mr. R. has intere&s;t enough to obtain the &s;ecretary's place, I &s;hall upon receiving proper &s;ecurity think my&s;elf in honor bound to &s;econd his views, though I have none at pre&s;ent from him but a conditional note he formerly wrote me. If he is not like to &s;ucceed, and my &s;on Daniel could have my place, I would be content unle&s;s affairs take a different turn to re&s;ign in his favor, whether admini&s;tration &s;hould think proper to make any further provi&s;ion for me or not. And yet I never thought of withdrawing my&s;elf from the &s;ervice, while there appeared to me any pro&s;|pect of my being able to promote it.</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote you a few days ago, and did not then think of troubling you upon any private affair of mine, at lea&s;t not &s;o &s;uddenly; but within this day or two, I have had conver&s;ation with Mr. Oliver, &s;ecretary of the province, the de&s;ign of which was my &s;ucceeding to the po&s;t he holds from the crown, upon the idea, that provi&s;ion would be made for governor Bernard, and the lieutenant governor would &s;ucceed to the chair, then the &s;ecretary is de&s;irous of being lieutenant governor, and if in any way, three hundred pounds a year could be annexed to the appointment. You are &s;en&s;ible the appointment is in one department, and the grant of money in another; now the pre&s;ent lieutenant governor has an a&s;&s;ignment of &pound;. 200 a year upon the cu&s;toms here; he has not received any thing from it as yet, and is doubtful if he &s;hall; he has no doubt of its lap&s;e to the crown, if he has the chair; if then by any intere&s;t that &s;um could be a&s;&s;igned to Mr. Oliver as lieutenant governor, and if he &s;hould be allowed (as has been u&s;ual for all lieutenant governors) to hold the command of the ca&s;tle, that would be another &pound;100. This would compleat the &s;ecretary's views; and he thinks his public &s;ervices, the injuries he has received in that &s;ervice, and the favorable &s;entiments entertained of him by go|vernment, may lead him to the&s;e views, and he hopes for the intere&s;t of his friends. The place of &s;ecretary is worth &pound;.300 a year, but is a
<PB N="39" REF="012818_0038_0F9091829BDEA0D8">
provincial grant at pre&s;ent, &s;o that it will not allow to be quartered on: And as I had view upon the place when I was in England, and went &s;o far as to conver&s;e with &s;everal men of intere&s;t upon it, tho' I never had an opportunity to mention it to you after I recovered my illne&s;s&mdash;I hope you will allow me your influ|ence, and by extending it at the trea&s;ury, to facilitate the a&s;&s;ignment of the &pound;. 200 a year, it will be &s;erving the &s;ecretary, and it will very much oblige me.&mdash;The &s;ecretary is advanced in life, tho' much more &s;o in health, which has been much impaired by the injuries he received, and he wi&s;hes to quit the more active &s;cenes; he con&s;iders this as a kind of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> cum dignitate,</HI> and from merits one may think he has a claim to it. I will mention to you the gentle|men, who are acquainted with my views and who&s;e favourable approbation I have had. Go|vernor Pownall, Mr. John Pownall, and Dr. Franklin.&mdash;My lord Hillsborough is not unac|quainted with it&mdash;I have &s;ince I have been here, wrote Mr. Jack&s;on upon the &s;ubject, and have by this ve&s;&s;el wrote Mr. Mauduir. I think my character &s;tands fair&mdash;I have not been without application to public affairs, and have acquired &s;ome knowledge of our provincial affairs, and not|with&s;tanding our many free conver&s;ations in Eng|land, I am con&s;idered here as on government &s;ide, for which I have been often traduced both publickly and privately, and very lately have had two or three &s;laps. The governor and lieutenant governor are fully acquainted with the negoci|ation, and I meet their approbation; all is upon the idea the governor is provided for, and there
<PB N="40" REF="012818_0039_0F9091834DCF7238">
&s;hall by any means be a vacancy of the lieut. go|vernor's place. I have gone &s;o far, as to &s;ay to &s;ome of my friends, that rather than not &s;ucceed I would agree to pay the &s;ecretary &pound;.100 a year out of the office to make up &pound;.300, provided he could obtain only the a&s;&s;ignment of &pound;.200&mdash;but the other propo&s;al would to be &s;ure be mo&s;t eli|gible.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now withdrawn to my little country villa, where, though I am more retired from the bu&s;y world, yet I am &s;till inveloped with unea&s;y reflections for a turbulent, dege|nerate, ungrateful continent, and the oppo&s;ition I have met with in my indefatigable endeavours to &s;ecure our property in this colony, but hitherto without &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;The times are &s;o corrupted and the conflict of parties &s;o predominant, that fac|tion is blind, or &s;huts her eyes to the mo&s;t evident truths that cro&s;s her de&s;igns, and believes in any ab&s;urdities that a&s;&s;i&s;ts to accompli&s;h her purpo&s;es under the pro&s;titution and pro&s;tra|tion of an infatuated government.&mdash;Judge then, my dear Sir, in what a critical &s;ituation the fortunes of we poor Europeans mu&s;t be among them.</P>
<P>We have not been able to recover our property for years pa&s;t, how great &s;over our exigencies may have been, unle&s;s we &s;oothed them into a compliance:&mdash;We are unwilling to enter into a liti&s;conte&s;tation with them, becau&s;e the perver|&s;ion of their iniquitous courts of ju&s;tice are &s;o great, that ex|perience has convinced us we had better loo&s;e half, to obtain the other quietly, than pur&s;ue compul&s;ary mea&s;ures:&mdash;We are al&s;o afraid to apply to a Briti&s;h Parliament for relief, as none can be effectually admini&s;trated without a change of govern|ment, and a better admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice introduced; and was it known here, that we made &s;uch application home, not only our fortunes would be in greater jeopardy, but our lives endangered by it before any &s;alutary regulations could take place.&mdash;We are &s;en&s;ible of the goodne&s;s of the King and Par|liament, but how far, or in what &s;pace of time our grievance, as a few individuals, might weigh again&s;t the influence of a charter government, we are at a lo&s;s to determine.</P>
<P>In 1761, I arrived in America, which circum&s;tance you pro|bably remember well:&mdash;With great indu&s;try, caution and circum&s;pection, I have not only reduced our demands, and regulated our connections in &s;ome mea&s;ure, but kept my head out of a HALTER which you had the honor to grace. (Pray Doctor how did it feel? The &s;ubject is &s;tale, but I mu&s;t be a little funny with you on the occa&s;ion.) Much &s;till remains to be done, and after all my be&s;t endeavours, my con&s;tituents, from a moderate calculation, cannot loo&s;e le&s;s than &pound;.50,000 &s;terling, by the baneful con&s;titution of this colony, and the corruption of their courts of judicature. <HI>It is really a very afflicting and melancholly con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P>Under a deep &s;en&s;e of the infirmities of their con&s;titution; the innovations which they have gradually interwoven among
<PB N="42" REF="012818_0041_0F909184C1E20288">
them&s;elves; and &s;timulated by every act of forbearance, lenity and patience, we have indulged our corre&s;pondents until de|luges of bankruptceys have en&s;ued, in&s;olvent acts liberated them from our ju&s;t demands, and finally, had our indi&s;putable accounts refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion for our proportion of the &s;mall re|mains, untill colony creditors were fir&s;t paid, and the whole ab&s;orbed. We have had ve&s;&s;els made over to us for the &s;ati&s;|faction of debts, and after bills of &s;ales were executed, carried off in open violence and forced by Capt.

We have in our turn been &s;ued in our ab|&s;ence, and condemned <HI>ex parte</HI> in large &s;ums for imaginary da|mages, for which we can neither obtain a trial, nor redre&s;s. They refu&s;e us an appeal to the King in Council; the money mu&s;t be paid when their executions become returnable; and were we to carry it home by way of complaint, it would co&s;t us two or three hundred pounds &s;terling, to pro&s;ecute, and after all, when his Maje&s;ty's decrees comes over in our favour, and refunding the money can no longer be evaded, I expect their effects will be &s;ecreted, their body's relea&s;ed by the in|&s;olvent act, and our money, both principal, intere&s;t and ex|pences irrecoverably gone.&mdash;Is not our ca&s;e grievous?&mdash;We have in actions founded upon notes of hand, been ca&s;t in their courts of judicature.&mdash;We have appealed to his Maje&s;ty in Council for redre&s;s, got their verdicts rever&s;ed, and obtained the King's decrees for our money, but <HI>that is all;</HI> for although I have had them by me above twelve months, and employed two eminent lawyers to enforce them into execution conform|able to the colony law, yet we have not been able to recover a &s;ingle &s;hilling, though we have danced after their courts and a&s;&s;embly's above THIRTY DAYS <HI>in vain</HI> to accompli&s;h that purpo&s;e only: Con&s;ider my dear Sir, what expence, vexation, and lo&s;s of time this mu&s;t be to us, and whether we have not ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o in vain waited with great impatience for years pa&s;t, in hopes his Maje&s;ty would have nominated his Judges, and other executive officers in every colony in Ame|rica, which would in a great mea&s;ure remove the cau&s;e of our complaint.&mdash;Nothing can be more nece&s;&s;ary than a &s;peedy re|gulation in this, and con&s;tituting it a regal government; and nothing is of &s;uch important u&s;e to a nation, as that men who excel in <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> &s;hould be encouraged to un|dertake the bu&s;ine&s;s of government: But the iniquitous cour&s;e of their courts of ju&s;tice in this colony, deter &s;uch men from &s;erving the public, or if they do &s;o, unle&s;s patronized at home, their wi&s;dom and virtue are turned again&s;t them with &s;uch malignity, that it is more &s;afe to be <HI>infamous</HI> than re|nowned.&mdash;The principal exception I have met with here, is James Helmes, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was cho&s;en Chief Ju&s;tice by the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly at la&s;t election.&mdash;He accepted his appointment, di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf by capacity and application, and &s;eems neither afraid nor a&s;hamed to admini&s;ter impartial ju&s;tice to <HI>all,</HI> even to the native and re&s;iding creditors of the mother country.&mdash;I have known him grant them temporary relief by

<P>It may be true policy, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to tame the fierce&s;t &s;pirit of popular liberty, not by blows or by chains, but by &s;oothing her into a willing obedience, and making her ki&s;s the very hand that re&s;trains her; but &s;uch policy would be a very un&s;uitable potion to cure the malady of the pre&s;ent times.

your friend is in power and confidence again, but that is in|deed a point I have much expectation, de&s;ire and faith in. As you have expre&s;&s;ed heretofore to me inclination of know|ing the proceedings of the Rhode-I&s;land A&s;&s;embly re&s;pecting compen&s;ation to the &s;ufferers in the riot of Newport, I now trouble you with a copy of my letter of this day to the Lords of the Trea&s;ury, which mutatis mutandis, is the &s;ame with that al&s;o to the Earl of Hil&s;borough of the &s;ame date with a copy of the narrative and letter to Lord Shelburne.</P>
<P>MY LORDS,</P>
<P>AGain I pre&s;ume upon troubling your Lord&s;hips with as &s;hort an account as may be written of what has very lately pa&s;&s;ed in the General A&s;&s;embly of Rhode I&s;land colo|ny, in reference to their granting of a compen&s;ation to the &s;ufferers from the riot of Newport 1765, as re&s;olved on in the Briti&s;h Parliament and very graciou&s;ly recommended from His Maje&s;ty to the Governor and Company of that colony by his principal Secretary of State.</P>
<P>Tired out and greatly mortified with a long cour&s;e of fre|quent fruitle&s;s and a very expen&s;ive attendance upon the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly, I had re&s;olved above a year ago to &s;olicit them no more: but at the interce&s;&s;ion of my fellow &s;ufferer Mr. Howard, Chief Ju&s;tice of North-Carolina, I was again prevailed upon to go to Newport in September la&s;t, where and when the A&s;&s;embly then met and I had &s;ufficient influ|ence to engage the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Deputies to move &s;everal times for reading a petition of Mr. Howard's, with an e&s;timate of his lo&s;s &s;olemnly &s;worn to and authenticated by a Notary Public&punc; with every nece&s;&s;ary pre&s;cribed form. The Speaker al&s;o urged upon the Hou&s;e becau&s;e of my attending from another colony upon that account only, but the Depu|ties would neither con&s;ent to hear Mr. Howard's petition nor receive his e&s;timate.</P>
<P>Immediately after this refu&s;al a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent from the Upper Hou&s;e of Magi&s;trates reque&s;ting the Lower Hou&s;e to enter now upon the riot of Newport by immediately impow|ering the High Sheriff to impannel a Jury of Inqui&s;ition to a&s;certain and repair the lo&s;s of Dr. Moffat, Mr. Howard and Mr. John&s;on, but the Hou&s;e of Deputies could not li&s;ten nor agree to any part of this propo&s;al from the Upper Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>About the middle of la&s;t month I wrote a mo&s;t re&s;pectful letter to the Governor of Rhode I&s;land and inclo&s;ed to his Honor the e&s;timate of my lo&s;s in the Newport riot &s;worn to before and atte&s;ted by a Magi&s;trate here reque&s;ting the favor of the Governor to lay the &s;ame before the en&s;uing A&s;&s;embly, The Governor writes on the &s;eventh of this month
<Q>that at the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of A&s;&s;embly he pre&s;ented my e&s;timate and read my letter in a great committee of both Hou&s;es of A&s;|&s;embly but could not prevail to have it con&s;idered then;</Q>
and adds
<Q>that he will endeavour to bring it in again next February.</Q></P>
<P>Under the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of a&s;&s;urance the General A&s;|&s;embly of Rhode I&s;land never will recompence the &s;ufferers

And my Lords may I yet rather pre&s;ume in writing to your Lord&s;hips to add that by endeavouring to re&s;tore in &s;ome mea&s;ure what I lo&s;t in that riot I am now &s;adly &s;en&s;ible that I have not overvalued the &s;ame in my e&s;timate, as al&s;o that if I am not compen&s;ated by the intere&s;t, genero&s;ity and equity of your Lord&s;hips, I can never expect to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of half the value I then lo&s;t as the Office of a Comptroler here I now hold, has but a very incon&s;iderable &s;alary with &s;mall perqui|&s;ites.</P>

<P>In my la&s;t letter which I hope you have received, as I ad|dre&s;&s;ed it to the care of your brother, I then touched upon Sir William John&s;on's being here &s;ome weeks in que&s;t of health, and of the plea&s;ure Mr. Stewart and I enjoyed with him; as al&s;o that Lord Charles Grenville Montague was here on pa&s;&s;ant with his Lady; and I al&s;o then intimated to you our happine&s;s in Mr. Harri&s;on the Collector of Bo&s;ton having accepted Mr. Stewart's warm invitation to come here after the very flagrant riot at Bo&s;ton, on which he had been &s;o greatly in&s;ulted, abu&s;ed and hurt, who came here with his lady, &s;on and daughter, and &s;taid a fortnight; when we planned and regulated all the&s;e colonies into a &s;y&s;tem which I could wi&s;h to &s;ee effected. Since which Mr. Stewart has vi|&s;ited Mr. Harri&s;on at Bo&s;ton at the time when Mrs. Harri&s;on with their &s;on and daughter failed for London as a place of perfect &s;afety and liberty. Mr. Harri&s;on's &s;on is capable and promi&s;ing, but was cruelly u&s;ed by the mob of Bo&s;ton, which will I hope induce Mr. Harri&s;on's friends or rather the friends of government to provide &s;uitably for &s;o young a &s;ufferer. I could not ea&s;ily within the compa&s;s of a letter to you &s;ay the plea&s;ure I have felt in ob&s;erving the &s;trict union and friend&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts and is now rivetted between Mr. Har|ri&s;on and Mr. Stewart upon principles of the true&s;t honor and virtue both of whom well under&s;tand and &s;incerely wi&s;h the true intere&s;t of Great-Britain and all her colonies, e&s;pecially in the cardinal articles of legi&s;lation and government, as al&s;o in the &s;ubaltern or le&s;&s;er points of taxation and revenue from which objects no attachments, connections or views will or ever can &s;way the one or the other. As I have been accu&s;|tomed to write to you with a plainne&s;s and freedom which I flatter my&s;elf has not been di&s;agreeable &s;o therefore I would further &s;ay of Mr. Stewart that he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rried in an opulent, popular and commercial family, &s;ome of whom perhaps may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have more oblique intere&s;t than may be con|&s;i&s;tent with regulation or a due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws of Great-Britatn, &s;o it is with a peculiar and very &s;en&s;ible &s;atis|faction that I can a&s;&s;ure you his &s;pirit, addre&s;s and conduct in &s;o nice a &s;ituation de&s;erves the greate&s;t prai&s;e and commenda|tions,

as it has perhaps been or may be very influential on &s;ome of the be&s;t among them, even to a better way of think|ing and acting. By the inclo&s;ed you will know that Mr. Stew|art now writes to Mr. Grenville, and mention &s;omewhat of his application for leave of ab&s;ence from the Trea&s;ury Board, which I only wi&s;h him to &s;ucceed in becau&s;e I think Mr. Har|ri&s;on and him really the mo&s;t capable per&s;ons here to throw light upon many tran&s;actions here which cannot be commu|nicated in letters or any written repre&s;entation to &s;atisfaction or proper advantage. If Mr. Stewart obtains leave to return home I &s;hall be unhappy enough by his ab&s;ence. Two years are now elap&s;ed &s;ince I came here, a great part of which has been &s;pent in anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hing for the Genius of Britain to awake and vindicate her &s;upreme juri&s;diction and authority impiou&s;ly que&s;tioned and denied in colonies &s;o very lately re|deemed from ho&s;tile incur&s;ions and encroachments, but I believe the time is now come, and I rejoice in its approach. I wi&s;h you every felicity with the preferment and employment you like be&s;t, and am, Sir,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN November la&s;t I wrote you from New London, and in|&s;erted in that letter a copy of what I had written to the Lords of the Trea&s;ury and the Earl of Hil&s;borough, relative to the compen&s;ation of the &s;ufferers in the riot of Newport 1765. I hope and very much wi&s;h that letter may have come to your hand, becau&s;e in it you will &s;ee how &s;tricly and &s;oon I fol|low your coun&s;el in making affidation to the e&s;timate of my lo&s;s, which as I apprehended made not the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion nor could make upon the General A&s;&s;embly of Rhode-I&s;land, becau&s;e there was not I believe a Member in either Hou&s;e that did not think and believe my lo&s;s exceeded the e&s;timate frequently laid before them to no purpo&s;e. I thank you therefore for the kind and good advice which I in&s;tantly fol|lowed, and which I think has fini&s;hed this long and tedious tran&s;action on this &s;ide of the Atlantic, which has not only been ineffectual but attended with much trouble and expence to me. How or in what light it may be now con&s;idered by Admini&s;tration or Parliament I cannot at this time and di&s;|tance judge, far le&s;s determine. Sometimes I flatter my&s;elf that a re&s;olve of the Briti&s;h Senate will not be allowed to be thus &s;corned and trampled upon; at other times I de&s;pond and think the object too &s;mall for attention; and as there were but three &s;ufferers in Rhode-I&s;land colony, two of whom to my great plea&s;ure and triumph are now amply and very honorably provided for, I &s;ometimes imagine that com|pen&s;ation may drop and be forgot, and indeed if it was not for the confidence which I have in you and &s;ome others in the Hou&s;e of Commons, I &s;hould certainly de&s;pair of any re|compence, and which upon recollection I mu&s;t acknowledge as criminal in a very great degree, becau&s;e of its having been
<PB N="51" REF="012818_0050_0F90918DB94DA998">
re&s;olved on in the Parliament of Great-Britain that &s;uch &s;uf|ferers &s;hould be compen&s;ated: And I am not con&s;cious that I have omitted, delayed or neglected any part of my duty in the cour&s;e of negotiating it here in America.</P>
<P>A few days ago I came here chiefly to &s;ee and enjoy my friend Collector Harri&s;on, that we might open bo&s;oms to one another upon the great &s;cene and field of affairs in this coun|try, the face of which is only altered apparently here from the arrival of the King's troops and &s;hips, which have indeed re&s;tored a very certain &s;ecurity and tranquility, and pre|vented if not put a final period to their mo&s;t pe&s;tilent town-meetings. There is nor can be no real alteration in the &s;enti|ment or di&s;po&s;ition of the prime di&s;turbers&mdash;This is but an interval or truce procured from the dread of a Bayonet&mdash;The &s;pecifical and catholic remedy derived from and founded in an acknowledgment of the Briti&s;h &s;upremacy and legi&s;lation over America manife&s;ted under the exerci&s;e of a more firm, regu|lar and con&s;i&s;tent plan of civil government, mu&s;t come from the decrets of the Briti&s;h Parliament, otherwi&s;e the country, and particularly New-England, will &s;oon and forever be in perpetual anarchy and di&s;obedience. The anxiety and di&s;|tre&s;s of the few here that are well affected to government be|fore the arrival of the troops and &s;hips was very great, and in my opinion will be greater if vigorous, &s;alutary and proper mea&s;ures are not adopted in Parliament.</P>
<P>All here &s;eem anxious and impatient to know the com|plexion and temper of the Briti&s;h Parliament, and what is ve|ry unaccountable if not incredible, the &s;ons of liberty here &s;o called are elevated with hope and a&s;&s;urance that their claims and preten&s;ions will be received and recognized as they affect to phra&s;e it, but if I err not, this pre&s;umption of hope may have ari&s;en or been cheri&s;hed in a great mea&s;ure by &s;ome vi&s;its of an officer of high military rank from New-York to &s;ome of the mo&s;t popular and violent ringleaders here, and I wi&s;h that I could &s;ay to you that the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous here had not been countenanced al&s;o by a per&s;on of another and very different &s;tation.</P>
<P>I and that in con&s;equence of and under an apprehen&s;ion of un&s;ettled, un&s;afe times here, Mr. Harri&s;on has thought it be&s;t that Mrs. Harri&s;on, his &s;on and daughter, &s;hould go to Lon|don, as a place of true liberty and &s;afety, and as I hope they will be arrived before this reaches you, and as I formerly mentioned to you Mr. Harri&s;on's &s;on as a young &s;ufferer very roughly handled upon the 10th of June, &s;o if you incline to &s;ee and di&s;cour&s;e him for intelligence or any other motive, Mr. Hallowell of this town can ea&s;ily bring him to you.</P>
<P>If any thing remarkable occurs here during my &s;tay I &s;hall not fail to write to you again.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir
Your mo&s;t obedient and mo&s;t humble Servant, THOMAS MOFFAT.</SIGNED>
