<P>IT &s;eems, there has in all Ages been &s;uch a <HI>Way.</HI> And the <HI>Way</HI> is in <HI>Ours</HI> as much <HI>trodden</HI> as ever. Yea, we have newly &s;een a formidable Exhibition of the <HI>Way,</HI> and of the End which the <HI>Way</HI> will bring unto. But there are things to be <HI>Mark|ed</HI> in the <HI>Way.</HI> There are many <HI>Remarkables</HI> in the <HI>Way.</HI> It may be a thing of <HI>Good Con&s;e|quence,</HI> yea, tis a thing of the <HI>La&s;t Importance,</HI> for us to take notice of them. We will this day <HI>Mark the Way that Wicked Men have trod|den.</HI> And indeed; this will be one proof that we do not <HI>take</HI> the <HI>Way.</HI> To <HI>Mark</HI> the way which <HI>Wicked Men do take,</HI> is a <HI>Step</HI> which <HI>Wicked</HI> Men do not u&s;e to <HI>take.</HI> Tis a <HI>Step</HI>

that would have a Tendency to bring them and keep them out of that <HI>way</HI> This made <HI>Eliphaz</HI> afraid that <HI>Job</HI> had fail'd in this point. He Feared, That <HI>Job</HI> had been tainted with this Impiety, To <HI>Forget</HI> that the Mo&s;t High God, who&s;e Throne is in the Heavens did <HI>mark the Ways</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> or take any cogni&s;ance of what they did in the world.

We are now ready to proceed upon our more <HI>Special Enquiries.</HI> And the&s;e will be no more than <HI>Two.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What</HI> is there to be <HI>Marked</HI> in the <HI>Way that Wicked Men have trodden;</HI> or, what &s;hall we find <HI>Remarkable</HI> in the <HI>Way of wicked Men!</HI> Many <HI>Remarks</HI> are to be made upon it. I will Single out a few, that will be as U&s;eful, as they are Obvious.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. We may <HI>Mark</HI> this in the <HI>Way that Wicked Men have trodden;</HI> Tis an <HI>old Way.</HI> It is a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, which a famous &amp; an accute <HI>Scotch</HI> Expo&s;itor has upon my Text; That <HI>Sin is a very Old Trade in the World.</HI> We read, Joh. 8. 44 It was <HI>from the Beginning.</HI> Sin was committed in the very <HI>Beginning</HI> of the World. The World had not been begun long before the <HI>Way of Sin</HI> was taken up. Tis true, the <HI>Way of Sin</HI> is not &s;o old, as the <HI>Way of Truth</HI> Our Excellent <HI>Caryl</HI> has well Ex|pre&s;&s;ed it; <Q>Tho' man <HI>quickly</HI> went <HI>out of the Way,</HI> &s;urely, his <HI>Fir&s;t &s;tep</HI> was not <HI>out of the Way.</HI> He <HI>went Right</HI> before he <HI>went Wrong;</HI> he <HI>&s;tood</HI> before he <HI>fell.</HI></Q> But then, the way of Sin is very <HI>old.</HI> In the <HI>Sinful ways</HI> of men, to &s;eek after a Felicity in things under the Sun, here tis that it has been &s;aid, <HI>There is no New Thing under the Sun.</HI> Tis no <HI>New Thing</HI> for men to Sin again&s;t God. And tho' men are <HI>Inventers of Evil Things,</HI> yet there is rarely

any &s;ort of Sin committed in <HI>our days,</HI> but what was committed in the <HI>Days of old.</HI> In|deed, we read, Jer. 6. 16 <HI>Ask for the old pathes, where is the Good way, and walk therein.</HI> There is a <HI>Good old Way.</HI> And it is the <HI>olde&s;t Way.</HI> The <HI>Greate&s;t Antiquity</HI> is to be pleaded for that <HI>Way.</HI> But then, there is an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll way,</HI> that is al&s;o an <HI>old Way.</HI> The <HI>Way o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sin,</HI> is a very <HI>beaten Way</HI> It was <HI>trodden,</HI> as here we find in the <HI>Old World,</HI> and long before the <HI>Flood.</HI> It was that <HI>Way,</HI> that the <HI>Flood</HI> ru&s;hed in upon the world. One gives this Paraphra&s;e on my Text. <HI>Ha&s;t thou marked the Way of the old World?</HI> An <HI>Old Way;</HI> Very near, very near, as old as the World. The very <HI>fir&s;t man,</HI> that was born into the World, proved a <HI>wicked man.</HI> Of Wicked men in our Days, We read, Jud. 11. <HI>They have gone in the way of Cain.</HI> The <HI>Nature</HI> of Man was <HI>betimes</HI> depraved with corruption. Ah, Mankind, How <HI>Early did&s;t thou ri&s;e, &amp; corrupt all thy Doings?</HI> Men have <HI>naturally</HI> taken the way of Sin, ever &s;ince our <HI>Fir&s;t Fall</HI> from God. And, how <HI>Quickly</HI> did we fall! <HI>Man in Honour, How few Nights did&s;t thou continue &s;o?</HI> The <HI>Way of Sin</HI> is more than five Thou&s;and and &s;even Hundred Years old. It is no Apology <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or an <HI>Evil thing;</HI> Tis <HI>no more than what others have done before me.</HI> The <HI>via trita,</HI> is not always <HI>via tuta.</HI> It may be an <HI>old Way,</HI> and yet not a <HI>&s;afe Way.</HI> It may be
<PB N="7" REF="002451_0008_0FDB54CE43316200">
an <HI>old Way,</HI> and yet be the <HI>Way that Wicked men have trodden. Sinners,</HI> what unde&s;ireable Company, will you find there, if by <HI>Wandring from the way of under&s;tanding,</HI> you go down to the <HI>Congregation of the Dead.</HI> You are going in the <HI>Old Way,</HI> &amp; the Sinners who trod that way in <HI>old Time,</HI> will be your Companions, in the <HI>End</HI> of the way. You will have your Souls gathered with <HI>Cain,</HI> and the Mon&s;ters of the <HI>old World;</HI> with the <HI>Sodomites,</HI> &amp; with <HI>Achithophel,</HI> and with <HI>Judas,</HI> and with the Wretches that a <HI>Great while ago,</HI> walked in that way of Sin that you have cho&s;en. Oh! poor Comfort, in having &s;uch <HI>Fellow-Suf|ferers!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. We may <HI>Mark</HI> this, in the <HI>Way that wicked men have trodden;</HI> Tis an <HI>Hard Way;</HI> a way full of <HI>Trouble.</HI> We read, Prov. 13 15. <HI>The way of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors is hard.</HI> Tho' it be a <HI>Broad Way,</HI> yet it is a <HI>Rough</HI> One. A Very Trouble&s;ome way. The way lies all thro' the <HI>Valley of Achor</HI> What we render, <HI>A way of wickedne&s;s,</HI> is in the Hebrew Original, A <HI>way of Grief</HI> Tis a <HI>Grievous Way.</HI> A Wic|ked man, <HI>His way is always Grievous.</HI> Of them that walk in this way, We read. Rom. 3. 17. <HI>The way of peace they have not known.</HI> In the <HI>way of Piety,</HI> there is a Glorious <HI>Peace</HI> to be Enjoy'd. <HI>Great peace have they that Love that Way;</HI> and if they were always in it, there

<P>Thirdly. We may <HI>Mark</HI> this in the <HI>way</HI> that <HI>wicked men have trodden,</HI> They are at more Pains in <HI>their</HI> way to <HI>Damn</HI> them&s;elves, than G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dly men are, in a <HI>better</HI> way to <HI>Save</HI> them|&s;elves.

A wicked man does more to <HI>Plea&s;e</HI> the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> &amp; the <HI>World,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Devil,</HI> than a godly man does to <HI>Plea&s;e God</HI> He &s;erves the <HI>De&s;troyer</HI> with more In|du&s;try, than one who yet finds Acceptance with Him, u&s;es in &s;erving the only <HI>Saviour.</HI> He is more Indu&s;trious to get him&s;elf put off with a <HI>Portion in this Life,</HI> than one who yet attains unto it, is to attain unto a <HI>better and la&s;ting Sub&s;tance in Heaven.</HI> He will wa&s;te his

<P>Fourthly. There is this to be <HI>Marked</HI> in the <HI>way that wicked men have trodden;</HI> Men are <HI>Deceived</HI> all the way; it is a very <HI>Deceitful</HI> way We read, Prov. 11. 18. <HI>The wicked worketh a deceitful work.</HI> A wicked man is drawn into his <HI>way,</HI> with many <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> which the <HI>Temp|ters</HI> make unto him. The <HI>Promi&s;es deceive</HI> him; his Temptations have <HI>impo&s;ed</HI> upon him; he meets with <HI>Di&s;appointments</HI> of all his Expecta|tions. He <HI>Promi&s;ed</HI> unto him&s;elf, &s;uch <HI>Satis|factions</HI> as he never meets withal. He is <HI>Pro|mi&s;ed,</HI> that he &s;hall find Contentment in his <HI>way;</HI> but his <HI>way</HI> never, never brings him to it. It is <HI>Promi&s;ed</HI> unto him, That when he has acquired &s;uch &amp; &s;uch Good Things, they will

It is <HI>Promi&s;ed</HI> unto him, that he &s;hall have a <HI>Long time</HI> yet in his way; <HI>Goods laid up for many Years.</HI> Lo, <HI>This Night thy Soul is required of thee!</HI> When a man takes the way of Sin, it may be &s;aid of him, as I&s;a. 44. 20. <HI>A deceived Heart hath turned him a&s;ide.</HI></P>
<P>And you may <HI>Mark</HI> this one <HI>Deceit</HI> more, than which there is hardly any more fre|quent, in the Way of a wicked man, He is <HI>deceived</HI> about the <HI>Nature,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Period</HI> of his Way. He is not apprehen&s;ive, <HI>what</HI> he is a doing, &amp; <HI>where</HI> he is a going. He apprehends no other, but that he may take this Way, &amp; yet not mi&s;s of Everla&s;ting Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. It is as we read, Prov. 14. 12. <HI>A way that &s;eems right to a man, but the end the way of death.</HI> Poor Sinner; Thou art a <HI>Self-deceiver!</HI> The man <HI>dreams,</HI> that he is in the <HI>way to the City of God;</HI> and that a Merciful God, will ea&s;ily forgive all the <HI>Fal&s;e &s;teps</HI> he has taken in his way, up|on his bare &s;aying, <HI>Lord, Have Mercy upon</HI> me!

Another in a Letter to his Brother &s;ays, <HI>I intreat you &amp; all other Young People, to avoid all bad Cour&s;es, e&s;pecially neglecting Prayer to God, Prophane Swearing &amp; Cur&s;ing, Hard-Drinking, &amp; Sabbath-Breaking.

I mu&s;t thank my &s;elf for it, that I am brought to this untimely di&s;mal End. I beg that it may be a Warning to all Young People to keep them&s;elves from all Bad Cour&s;es e&s;pecially from Sabbath-Breaking, Drinking to Exce&s;s, and Bla&s;pheming the Name of God. And I be&s;eech all that are Servants, to keep with, and be faithful to their Ma&s;ters; for if I had been Dutiful to mine, 'tis likely, I had not been brought to the untimely End, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> am now come to.</HI></P>

<P>Another in a Letter to his Mother, Ad|dre&s;&s;es her thus: <HI>The News of my being under a Sentence of Death, I believe is very &s;inking &amp; dreadful to you. I pray that God will &s;upport you under your Sorrows &amp; &s;anctify them to you. I hope I &s;hall receive from GOD the Pardon of all my Sins, for the &s;ake of His dear SON and the only SAVIOUR of Sinners. I pray GOD to help me to believe in Chri&s;t, Repent of all my Sins &amp; fit for Death. I am &s;orry to think, that I was &s;o circum&s;tanced while among the Pirates, as to want the Opportunities which I had before, of Be|nefitting my Soul, &amp; fitting for Eternity.</HI> And in a Letter to his Brother, He thus be&s;peaks him, <HI>I earne&s;tly be&s;eech you to &s;eek the Lord for your &s;elf &amp; yours, while He may be found. Don't regl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ct to bring your Children up in the Fear of God. I hope you will as far as you can, &amp; may, keep them from going to Sea.

I hope you will take the be&s;t Care you can, of our Aged Mother while &s;he is Living, and at her Death.</HI></P>

<P>I De&s;ire you all in General to take Warn|ing by me; for you &s;ee what a Greedy Eye brings a Young Man to. Beware how you Di&s;obey your Friends. Beware of Drunkenne&s;s, for it is the Inlet of all other Sins. I mu&s;t Confe&s;s that I was not Guilty of Murder, nor of Striking Men as others were: But of all other Sins I was Guilty, of which I a&s;k God Pardon. I have been guilty of Offending &amp; Denying Thee the God that is above, in Profaning thy Holy Name &amp; Sabbath, &amp; Polluting of thy Ordinances, &amp; al&s;o committing all the Injuries we were capable of, upon our Neighbours Bodies or Goods in a manner. I De&s;ire you all to O|bey your Parents, give a good Ear to the Preachers of God, this Slighted have I; Shun Theft, Drunkenne&s;s Swearing, Evil|Speaking, Lying, and all Evil Frays. So I leave you to GOD &amp; the World: And I hope I am Provided for a better World, &amp; a Glorious Heavenly Kingdom.</P>

<P>Another De&s;ired, That Ma&s;ters would not be Har&s;h &amp; Severe to their Servants, &amp; that Servants would be Dutiful to their Ma&s;ters, and Diligent in their Bu&s;ine&s;s. Another De&s;ired, That Parents, would be Careful, To

Thus Far had they gone from God! But when they were brought into Pri&s;on, They Quickly &s;eemed Thankful to God, for His Mercy in bringing them thither.
