<HEAD>The Committee appointed by the Honorable Board the <HI>16</HI>th In&s;tant, beg Leave to make the following Report. W. BRATTLE, per Order.</HEAD>
<P>THE Committee having maturely con&s;idered the two petitions to the Honorable Board from the Secretary, <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> together with his Affidavit concerning the Proceedings at Council on the 6th and 7th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, annexed to a pamphlet publi&s;hed in London, and the &s;everal depo&s;itions on the &s;ubject matter of the &s;aid Affidavit, take occa&s;ion to make a few ob&s;erva|tions from and upon them.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;aid Affidavit &s;everal things are ob&s;ervable from it.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> That what is there declared to have been &s;aid by Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> in Council, is expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as to be generally under|&s;tood to repre&s;ent, that antecedent to the unhappy affair of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t&punc; there had been a plan formed by people of the be&s;t character among us to remove the troops out of the town of Bo&s;ton, and after that, the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> That divers Gentlemen of the Council adopted what had been &s;o &s;aid.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> That the Secretary had in his draft expre&s;&s;ed what had been &s;aid in debate at Council in the terms in the &s;aid Affidavit recited; and that this form or draft of his "was allowed (by the Council) &s;trictly to expre&s;s the truth, but that it would not &s;tand well on the Council Records": whereupon "one of the Gentlemen of the Board prepared an amendment" which "was &s;ub&s;tituted."</P>
<P>As to the 1&s;t article, the plan therein mentioned was, according to the &s;aid Affidavit, intended to effect the removal of the troops, and the removal of the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>With regard to the removal of the troops, Mr. <HI>Tyler,</HI> who men|tioned the &s;aid plan in Council on the 6th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, declares in his depo&s;ition,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 11 in the Appendix.</NOTE> "that he uttered nothing in &s;aid Council purport|ing that any plan had been formed to remove the troops previous
<PB N="3" REF="011737_0005_0F8870D521230840">
to their firing on the inhabitants; that he had no idea of a plan formed for the removal of &s;aid troops until the day after the &s;hock|ing &s;cene on the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t; and that he then meant to be under&s;tood that the di&s;po&s;ition of the people to remove the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ops was occa&s;ioned by the killing and wounding of divers inhabitants of the town, and by the people's apprehen&s;ions that the troops &s;till had an unfriendly de&s;ign again&s;t them."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Erving,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pitts</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dexter</HI> in their depo&s;itions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 10 Appendix.</NOTE> de|clare, "that they cannot recollect, neither do they believe, that any thing was &s;aid in Council by Mr. <HI>Tyler,</HI> purporting, that any plan had been formed to remove the troops, previous to their firing on the inhabitants, but that they under&s;tood Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean that the people were excited to &s;uch a mea&s;ure by the killing and wounding of &s;ome of the inhabitants of the town on the even|ing immediately preceding."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Danforth</HI> and the other members of the Board, then pre&s;ent in Council, have made in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame declaration in their re&s;pective depo&s;itions. Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> the Secretary's deputy, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant <HI>Francis Skinner,</HI> by their depo&s;itions,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 5 and 6.</NOTE> taken at the de&s;ire of the Secretary, on being a&s;ked, declared, that when Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> men|tioned the plan afore&s;aid they did not apprehend him to mean a plan concerted previous to the &s;ixth of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t; and the Secre|tary him&s;elf has lately declared before the Board, that he did not conceive Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean &s;uch a preconcerted plan; and that he never believed any &s;uch plan had been formed. All which declara|tions amount to a &s;atisfactory proof, that what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> &s;aid in Council did not convey the idea that a plan had been formed to re|move the troops previous to their killing a number of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>With regard to a plan for the removal of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 5 and 6.</NOTE> declares "he heard Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> &s;ay, that there was a plan formed to remove the troops from the town, and that they would not &s;top there but would remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners al&s;o." <HI>Francis Skinner</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 5 and 6.</NOTE> declares in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame: as does al&s;o Capt. Caldwell: <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 3.</NOTE> the two fir&s;t however &s;ay, that they did not apprehend Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> meant a plan concerted previous to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t. With regard to this circum&s;tance Capt. <HI>Caldwell</HI> is not explicit, and it does not appear that any que&s;tion was a&s;ked him concerning it.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Dalrymple</HI> in the body of his depo&s;ition <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">No. 4.</NOTE> &s;ays nothing concerning the Commi&s;&s;ioners: but after he had &s;igned and delivered it, being a&s;ked whether he remembered that Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> &s;aid, that part of the plan was to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners out of town? He an&s;wered, "that &s;omething of that kind was mentioned by &s;ome gentleman of the Council during the debates, but he cannot &s;ay whe|ther it was Mr. <HI>Tyler.</HI>"</P>
<P>This is the whole of what is declared on the po&s;itive &s;ide relative to the Commi&s;&s;ioners.&mdash;Two of the declarants, viz. Me&s;&s;rs <HI>Cotton</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="011737_0006_0F8870D5E11B20D0">
<HI>Skinner</HI> &s;ay they were called out divers times while the Council was &s;itting and in the cour&s;e of the proceedings and Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> infers from it, "that he cannot declare &s;o fully as tho&s;e who attended with|out interruption."&mdash;Capt. <HI>Caldwell</HI> did not go to the Council till 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of <HI>March,</HI> and therefore can|not judge of what pa&s;&s;ed at Council &s;o well as tho&s;e who attended both parts of the day: and Colonel <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> who did attend both parts of the day, did not recollect when he delivered his depo&s;ition, that any thing had been &s;aid concerning the Commi&s;&s;ioners; and his an&s;wer, when a&s;ked as above, &s;hews he had only a general remem|brance of &s;omething &s;aid about the Commi&s;&s;ioners; but what it was, does not clearly appear by his an&s;wer. It is very likely that what pa&s;&s;ed between the Lieutenant Governor and &s;everal of the Council relative to the protection of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, as below mentioned, was the thing that lay in his mind.</P>
<P>It is not doubted that the&s;e Declarants under&s;tood Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> in the &s;en&s;e they have declared, but it is probable they might mi&s;ap|prehend him. It appears by Mr. <HI>Gray</HI>'s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 8.</NOTE> and other depo&s;itions, that the Lieutenant Governor a&s;ked the Board, what protection there would be for the Commi&s;&s;ioners if both regiments were order'd to the Ca&s;tle: and this, very probably, gave the occa&s;ion for mention|ing the Commi&s;&s;ioners at all.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Tyler,</HI> upon that que&s;tion, might expre&s;s his &s;entiments on that head; and having &s;o fair an opportu|nity, might al&s;o expre&s;s his &s;entiments concerning the Commi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves, and the low e&s;timation in which they are held by people in general, not only here but throughout the continent: and this being intermixed with the &s;ubject of the day, viz. the removal of the troops, might occa&s;ion what he meant to &s;ay relative to the troops only, to be under&s;tood by &s;ome as relative to them and the Commi&s;&s;ioners al&s;o It is certain that all the Gentlemen of the Council then pre|&s;ent, have declared on oath, they have no remembrance that Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> &s;aid there was a plan laid for the removal of the Commi&s;&s;io|ners; and Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> adds to this declaration, that he took particu|lar notice of what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> did &s;ay&punc; Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> him&s;elf,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 8.</NOTE> upon the mo&s;t &s;erious recollection, declares on oath, "that the a&s;&s;ertion, that he &s;aid there was a plan formed to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners, or that it was any part of a plan to remove them, is a gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations; and that in his be&s;t judgment and firm belief no plan to remove the troops, before their firing on the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, or at any time whatever to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms, ever was formed or forming by the people, or any number of per|&s;ons whatever." He further declares "that on the Lieut. Governor's a&s;king in &s;aid Council, what will become of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, if the troops &s;hould be removed, &s;everal of the Council gave it as their opinion, that they would be &s;afe, and that they always had been &s;afe: And he verily believes nothing was &s;aid to the contrary by any one of the Council pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> declares,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 8.</NOTE> that upon the Lieut. Governor's a&s;king the &s;aid que&s;tion, he an&s;wered, "that the Commi&s;&s;ioners would be as
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 11.</NOTE>
<PB N="5" REF="011737_0007_0F8870D6A11A80A8">
&s;afe without the troops as with them: for that the people would never be &s;o mad as to offer them the lea&s;t violence when the troops could &s;o ea&s;ily be recalled for their protection." He further de|clares "that one Gentleman at the Board immediately &s;econded him, and a&s;&s;ured his Honor of their &s;afety, and added, that he would pawn his life they &s;hould receive no injury."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Danforth</HI> declares,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 7.</NOTE> "he well remembers that divers of the Council then declared, that in their opinion the Commi&s;&s;ioners might continue in town in all &s;afety after the troops were removed thence; and that no one of the Council pre&s;ent di&s;covered an opinion diver&s;e therefrom."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Erving</HI> declares,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 10.</NOTE> that "he &s;aid at the Board, in the hearing of the Lieut. Governor, on the 6th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, that in his opinion the Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;afe in town, and never had been in danger; and that he would pawn his life they would remain &s;afe, or words of the &s;ame import."</P>
<P>If the foregoing circum&s;tances and declarations be duly remarked, it will appear highly probable that if Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> &s;aid any thing about the Commi&s;&s;ioners it was mi&s;under&s;tood: and this will appear &s;till more &s;o, if it be further remarked, that, on the contrary &s;uppo&s;ition, it mu&s;t have been con&s;idered as a rea&s;on for the troops remaining in town, if the Commi&s;&s;ioners had been &s;uppo&s;ed to be in danger; as has been ob&s;erved by &s;everal of the deponents; and "the &s;aid de|ponents are per&s;uaded it would have been &s;o con&s;idered by the Lieu|tenant Governor, and the commanding officer of the troops, and con&s;equently tended to defeat the very end, which the &s;everal mem|bers of the Council, and Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> in particular, are repre&s;ented as aiming at. And they further ob&s;erve, that had he mentioned it as his opinion, that there was a de&s;ign of the people to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners, it would have been &s;o utterly contrary to the &s;enti|ments of the&s;e deponents, and they doubt not of every other mem|ber of the Council pre&s;ent, except him&s;elf, that they verily believe it mu&s;t have produced &s;uch a di&s;pute, and oppo&s;ition, as could not &s;o &s;oon have been forgot."</P>
<P>The &s;econd thing ob&s;ervable from the Secretaty's Affidavit<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 1.</NOTE> is, that divers Gentlemen of the Council, by referring expre&s;sly to it, adopted what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had &s;aid, viz. That people of the be&s;t cha|racters among us had formed a plan not only to remove the troops but the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>In contradiction to this, every Gentleman of the Council then pre&s;ent, deny that they adopted any &s;uch declaration. So far are they from adopting what is repre&s;ented to have been &s;aid by Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> about a plan for the removal of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that there is not one of them has the lea&s;t remembrance of any thing &s;aid con|cerning a plan to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners: and therefore they could not refer to it, or in any &s;en&s;e whatever adopt it.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Hubbard</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="011737_0008_0F8870D7611CB328">
and Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;ell</HI> declare,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 9.</NOTE> "that they cannot recollect that they heard a word from Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> of any intention to remove the Commi&s;|&s;ioners, &s;o neither could they have adopted &s;uch a &s;trange opinion, had it been advanced by any per&s;on whatever."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Erving,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pitts,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dexter</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">10.</NOTE> declare the &s;ame; and add, "that, according to their be&s;t remembrance, what was <HI>really</HI> &s;aid in Council by Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> was not referred to by any other mem|ber pre&s;ent in &s;uch manner, as that it could with the lea&s;t degree of propriety be affirmed in general terms, as it is in the depo&s;ition of the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Oliver,</HI> that they adopted what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had &s;aid."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Danforth</HI> in his depo&s;ition recites,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 7.</NOTE> "that whereas in Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI>'s aforementioned affidavit, it is a&s;&s;erted that divers members of the Council adopted what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had &s;aid, by referring to it, and thereby excu&s;ing them&s;elves from enlarging (which a&s;&s;ertion plainly imports that divers members of the Council a&s;&s;ented to and adopted all that Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> in his affidavit had repre&s;ented to have been &s;aid by Mr. <HI>Tyler,</HI> relative to a plan formed to remove the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners as well as the troops) He the deponent declares, that al|tho' he had the like apprehen&s;ions Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had of the danger of further blood&s;hed, in ca&s;e the troops &s;hould continue in the town, yet that he never adopted any &s;entiment, that a plan had been con|certed for removing the Commi&s;&s;ioners (or even the troops by way of compul&s;ion) and, &s;o far at lea&s;t as relates to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, this deponent is fully per&s;uaded, that no member of the Council then pre&s;ent, did adopt the &s;ame: ina&s;much as he well remembers that divers of them then declared, that in their opinion the Commi&s;|&s;ioners might continue in town with all &s;afety after the troops were removed thence; and no one of the Council then pre&s;ent di&s;covered an opinion diver&s;e therefrom."</P>
<P>From the&s;e depo&s;itions and what went before, it appears that the &s;aid Gentlemen of the Council were &s;o far from adopting what the Secretary repre&s;ents to have been &s;aid by Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> concerning a plan for the removal of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that there is not one of them has the lea&s;t remembrance of any thing &s;aid about &s;uch a plan; and therefore they could not refer to it, or in any &s;en&s;e whatever adopt it.</P>
<P>The third thing ob&s;ervable in the Secretary's Affidavit<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">No. 1.</NOTE> is, what he declares about his draft expre&s;&s;ing what had been &s;aid in debate at Council, that it was allowed by the Council &s;trictly to expre&s;s the truth, but that it would not &s;tand well on the council records. This declaration repre&s;ents the Council in a very odious light. It conveys to the world this idea, that they rejected his draft becau&s;e it was true; and that the truth of it made it unfit to be recorded in the Council books: Whereupon an amendment was &s;ub&s;tituted. To &s;ub&s;titute an amendment, that alters the truth, is to &s;ub&s;titute a fal&s;ehood; and as the &s;aid declaration &s;ugge&s;ts &s;uch a &s;ub&s;titution, is implies a charge of fal&s;ehood upon the Gentlemen that were pre&s;ent
<PB N="7" REF="011737_0009_0F8870D821152D60">
at that Council. But although the Committee apprehend the Se|cretary did not intend any &s;uch charge, yet his words may probably be con&s;trued to imply it.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;aid amendment, mo&s;t of the &s;aid Gentlemen have expre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments in their re&s;pective depo&s;itions. Five of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 9 and 10.</NOTE> declare, "that the words made u&s;e of in the amendment, as recited by the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> in his depo&s;ition, which were the next morning propo&s;ed in Council to be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of the terms the Secretary had u&s;ed in the minutes the day before, the&s;e deponents then verily thought le&s;s liable to be mi&s;con&s;trued; and that by this alteration the true meaning and intent of the &s;everal members of the Council, in what they had on the preceeding day &s;aid to the Lieutenant Governor, of the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, would fully and fairly appear."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Danforth</HI> declares,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 7.</NOTE> "that the &s;aid amendment was unanimou&s;ly agreed to by the members of the Council then pre&s;ent, and contains the whole of what, after full debate and mature con&s;ideration, was by them adopted, and (together with the advice given to the Lieute|nant Governor, to u&s;e his influence that the troops might be removed) was, as this deponent apprehends, the whole that could regularly be certified by the Secretary, as they were the only Votes of Council that had pa&s;&s;ed upon that occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>The Committee next proceed to con&s;ider the Secretary's two Petitions<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 2 and 12.</NOTE> to the Board, and to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on them.</P>
<P>In one of them he repre&s;ents, "that his Depo&s;ition or Affidavit above-mentioned appears by the tenor of it to have been made meerly to vindicate the Lieutenant-Governor, in de&s;iring that his Maje&s;ty's troops might be removed to Ca&s;tle William, after the fatal cata&s;trophe of the 5th of <HI>March:</HI> he having been called upon by the Lieutenant-Governor to give a true relation of the proceedings had in Council on that affair."&mdash;If the Lieutenant-Governor de|&s;ired the &s;aid depo&s;ition for his vindication, could he not have been vindicated without the Secretary's traducing the Council, and bring|ing into que&s;tion the loyalty of the Town of Bo&s;ton, or Province? Was it not traducing the Council, to &s;ugge&s;t that they rejected his draft becau&s;e it &s;trictly expre&s;&s;ed the truth? And was it not bring|ing into que&s;tion the loyalty of the Town or Province, to &s;ugge&s;t that a plan had been formed by people of the be&s;t characters among us to remove the Troops and Commi&s;&s;ioners, and that divers of the Council adopted or allowed it to be true that there was &s;uch a plan? Do the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, and the declarations contained in the Secretary's depo&s;ition, in which he wholly omits what was &s;aid about the &s;afety of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, comport with a true relation of the proceed|ings had in Council on the above-mentioned affair; which relation the Lieutenant-Governor called upon him for?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="011737_0010_0F8870D8E1150650">The Secretary further repre&s;ents, that "as holding his commi&s;&s;ion immediately from the King, who therein expre&s;&s;es his confidence in his fidelity, he could not con&s;ider him&s;elf as acting in breach of tru&s;t, in making &s;aid depo&s;ition, as he was called upon by the Com|mander in Chief, who is the King's repre&s;entative, to give a true relation of the proceedings had in Council on that day."</P>
<P>Though the Secretary holds his commi&s;&s;ion immediately from the King, the commi&s;&s;ion con&s;titutes him an officer of the Province, to do the bu&s;ine&s;s appertaining to the office of Secretary but does not give the Commander in Chief, notwith&s;tanding he is the King's re|pre&s;entative in the Province, any authority over him.&mdash;By virtue of his commi&s;&s;ion, he is to do the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of Secretary. But could it be a part of &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s to take minutes at Council of what all or any of the members &s;aid in their debates? and after|wards to give a depo&s;ition of it, when called upon by the Comman|der in Chief? If it was not a part of &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s, for what pur|po&s;e could he want to a&s;&s;i&s;t his memory by the &s;aid minutes? Could this be any proof of fidelity to the King? or could it not be con&s;idered as a breach of tru&s;t? Would not &s;uch an idea of the bu&s;ine&s;s of a Secretary degrade him into the character of a &s;py and an informer? Would it not be incon&s;i&s;tent with freedom of con&s;ul|tation and debate, and con&s;equently with one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential privileges and rights of Council? and would it not therefore be &s;ub|ver&s;ive of every principle, which di&s;tingui&s;hes a free government from de&s;poti&s;m? But admitting that the Secretary, as the King's officer, is under obligation to take &s;uch minutes at Council and reduce them to a depo&s;ition if de&s;ired by the King's repre&s;entative (which is utterly denied) yet it appears by one of the Secretary's petitions to the Board, that he officiou&s;ly, without the privity of any one, took the minutes of what was &s;aid in the debates of Council on the 5th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>If the Secretary could think him&s;elf authorized to take &s;uch mi|nutes, and give &s;uch a depo&s;ition, was he not under the obligation of honor, and did not ju&s;tice require him, to communicate it to the Council before he had compleated and delivered it? Had he done &s;o, the mi&s;takes and partial repre&s;entations contained in it might have been corrected, and his own honor and ju&s;tice remained unimpeached.</P>
<P>It has been for &s;ome time ju&s;tly complained of, that depo&s;itions, memorials, and every &s;pecies of information, have been taken and &s;ent to England in a &s;ecret manner; and there made u&s;e of to re|pre&s;ent his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects here in an odious light: which has occa&s;ioned troops and naval armaments to be &s;ent hither, to the great and unju&s;t annoyance and di&s;tre&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects of this Province. It was therefore the more extraordinary that the Secretary, in the affair of his depo&s;ition, &s;hould act in the &s;ame &s;ecret manner, e&s;pecially as it re&s;pected what had been &s;aid in Council; about which he could ea&s;ily have informed him&s;elf from the mem|bers of it, who at the &s;ame time had a right to know what he had
<PB N="9" REF="011737_0011_0F8870D9A1240DF8">
repre&s;ented concerning them.&mdash;Whatever may have been de&s;igned with regard to the operation of this depo&s;ition, the manife&s;t ten|dency of it is to give a mo&s;t unfavorable, and at the &s;ame time a mo&s;t unju&s;t idea of the people here, and of the Council in particular.</P>
<P>As the &s;aid depo&s;ition repre&s;ents the Council in an ill light, it could be no di&s;agreeable pre&s;ent to Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> to whom it was &s;ent by the Lieutenant-Governor, as he informed the Board. His Honor at the &s;ame time informed them, that he de&s;ired Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> to keep it to him&s;elf, unle&s;s his conduct with regard to the removing the troops &s;hould be faulted, in which ca&s;e it was to be made u&s;e of for his Honor's vindication. Whether it was u&s;ed or not for that purpo&s;e is uncertain: but this is certain, that it has been publi&s;hed in London, annexed with other depo&s;itions to a printed pamphlet, intitled "A fair account of the late unhappy di&s;turbance at Bo&s;ton, in New-England": in which pamphlet and depo&s;itions is given a very unfair, and, in all material circum&s;tances, a very fal&s;e account of what it therein called the late unhappy di|&s;turbance. The mo&s;t material thing aimed at in the &s;aid pamphlet, is to obtrude as truth on the public this fal&s;ehood, viz. that a plan was here laid for the expul&s;ion of the troops, prior to their firing on and killing a number of the inhabitants of the town: and the principal if not the only depo&s;ition that in any mea&s;ure tends to &s;upport &s;uch a charge is the Secretary's above mentioned.</P>
<P>This depo&s;ition has in &s;ome degree an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of the Pamphlet writer or procurer; and is well calculated <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> an&s;wer the further purpo&s;e of Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> to effect a change in the con|&s;titution of the Council, by giving of the la&s;t year's Council a very di&s;advantageous idea; from which will be formed the idea of the pre&s;ent Council, which include the &s;ame members as the la&s;t.</P>
<P>This depo&s;ition has been attended with circum&s;tances that appear in &s;ome degree remarkable. It was taken on the &s;ame day on which the other depo&s;itions (or mo&s;t of them) annexed to the &s;ame pam|phlet, were taken, viz. the 13th of <HI>March.</HI> They all went (as &s;eems probable) by Mr. Commi&s;&s;ioner <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> who &s;ailed for England the 16th of <HI>March</HI>; and they are all publi&s;hed together in the &s;ame pamphlet. Whether the&s;e circum&s;tances are ca&s;ual, or whether they indicate a mutual corre&s;pondence and communication between per&s;ons here, with regard to the &s;aid depo&s;itions, there do not appear any &s;ufficient means preci&s;ely to determine.</P>
<P>The Secretary further repre&s;ents "how cautious he was in fram|ing his depo&s;ition; and that he is confident he has been preci&s;e in &s;etting down the very words u&s;ed on the occa&s;ion, without adding any con&s;truction of his own."</P>
<P>How cautious and preci&s;e the Secretary has been, e&s;pecially in repre&s;enting what was &s;aid about the Commi&s;&s;ioners, has fully ap|peared above, under the article relative to them. He not only gives an imperfect account of what he has repre&s;ented, but has wholly
<PB N="10" REF="011737_0012_0F8870DA6112DBA0">
omitted all the declarations made at Council, relative to the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, that they would be &s;afe, notwith&s;tanding the troops &s;hould be removed: which has already &s;ufficiently appeared.</P>
<P>The Secretary goes on to ob&s;erve, that "the principal matter, wherein the te&s;timony of divers [or rather of all] of &s;aid Gentlemen differs from his own, appears to him to be concerning what relates to the Commi&s;&s;ioners: with regard to which he apprehends his de|po&s;ition is fully &s;upported by the te&s;timony of <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> witne&s;&s;es then pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>The Secretary here &s;ugge&s;ts that the Gentlemen of the Council are intere&s;ted; and therefore that their te&s;timony, wherein it differs from that of his witne&s;&s;es, whom he repre&s;ents as di&s;intere&s;ted, mu&s;t be invalidated.</P>
<P>Seven Gentlemen of the Council have given te&s;timony about what Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> is repre&s;ented to have &s;aid in Council, concerning the Troops and Commi&s;&s;ioners. In this matter, it is evident, they are wholly di&s;intere&s;ted. What inducement then could they have to per|vert the truth? How is their te&s;timony in this matter invalidated?&mdash; They may be &s;tiled di&s;intere&s;ted witne&s;&s;es, as properly as tho&s;e pro|duced by the Secretary; and much more &s;o than two of them, who act under, and are dependant on the Secretary for their conti|nuance in office.</P>
<P>The Committee have been thus particular in this matter, that the true &s;tate of it might appear; and that thereby the pernicious con&s;equences to the Province, which the Honorable Board appre|hend the Secretary's depo&s;ition may be attended with, may be prevented.</P>
<P>So far as this matter &s;tands related to the Council, it appears that the Secretary's depo&s;ition exhibits to the world a very di&s;honorable and injurious idea of them, by &s;ugge&s;ting, that becau&s;e his draft was allowed &s;trictly to expre&s;s the truth, it would not &s;tand well on the Council records, and was therefore rejected by the Council. &mdash;It appears al&s;o that the Secretary, in a &s;ecret manner, has taken minutes at Council of what was &s;aid by the members of the Council in their debates.&mdash;That he has &s;ub&s;cribed his name to a paper con|taining tho&s;e minutes, and has taken his depo&s;ition before <HI>Fo&s;ter Hutchin&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to the truth of it; al&s;o, that the &s;aid paper and depo&s;ition have been &s;ent by the Lieutenant-Governor to Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> and that they have been &s;ince publi&s;hed, with other depo|&s;itions, annexed to a printed pamphlet de&s;igned to defame the Pro|vince, with regard to the unhappy affair of the 5th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>The conduct of the Secretary in this affair is not only a breach of tru&s;t in him, and injurious to the character and honor of the Council, but is de&s;tructive of all freedom of &s;peech and debate, and con&s;equently a breach of privilege&mdash;the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential privilege belonging to the Council, or that can belong to a deliberative body.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011737_0013_0F8870DB21134900">The Committee therefore are humbly of opinion, that the honor of the Council requires that the Board &s;hould come into the follow|ing Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Secretary of this Pro|vince&punc; by &s;ecretly taking minutes at Council of what was &s;aid by the members of Council in their debates, al&s;o by &s;igning a paper con|taining tho&s;e minutes, and further by giving his depo&s;ition to the truth of it, has in each and all tho&s;e in&s;tances acted incon&s;i&s;tent with the duty of his office, and thereby is guilty of a breach of tru&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Honorable his Maje&s;ty's Council for the &s;aid Province,</SALUTE>
Humbly &s;hews <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI></OPENER>
<P>THAT it &s;o happened he had no opportunity to &s;ee the Report of your Committee and your Honor's Re&s;olutions thereon until &s;ome time after they had pa&s;&s;ed the Board. That he did im|mediately thereupon ob&s;erve to your Honors upon two paragraphs in &s;aid Report relating to facts only; and pray an alteration; but as your Honors were then of opinion that the clau&s;es to which he excepted, might as well be &s;et right by his explaining him&s;elf in a written Addre&s;s to the Board, he now begs leave to ob&s;erve upon the &s;aid clau&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them runs thus&mdash; "The Secretary him&s;elf has lately declared before the Board that he did not conceive Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean &s;uch a preconcerted plan, and that he never believed any &s;uch plan had been formed."&mdash;Your petitioner upon reading the Report, declared to your Honors that he well remembered that he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e terms&mdash;"I <HI>do not</HI> believe any <HI>&s;uch</HI> plan <HI>ever</HI> had been formed"&mdash;and no one Gentleman at the Board would under|take to &s;ay the expre&s;&s;ion was&mdash;"I <HI>never did</HI> believe any <HI>&s;uch</HI> plan had been formed"&mdash;The&s;e &s;everal modes of expre&s;&s;ion he appre|hends do convey ideas very e&s;&s;entially different. And when your Honors recollect that this was not declared in an addre&s;s to the Honorable Board, but rather &s;aid in conver&s;ation with &s;ome of the members near whom he &s;at, it will not be thought &s;trange that the expre&s;&s;ion can be no better a&s;certained by the Board.</P>
<P>As to the other part of this declaration, viz. "That he did not conceive Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean <HI>&s;uch</HI> a preconcerted plan"&mdash;he humbly conceives he mu&s;t have been mi&s;under&s;tood; becau&s;e he has been all along &s;tudiou&s;ly careful to give no opinion about it, and has always wi&s;hed he might never be brought to a public declaration upon that matter. He thinks it very probable &s;uch an opinion might be taken up by the Board, from his repeatedly declaring "that he had not in his depo&s;ition &s;et forth that Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> had &s;aid there was a preconcerted plan"; and would by no means be under&s;tood even to in&s;inuate that the honorable Board meant to put any unju&s;t colouring upon the declarations made by your petitioner before them. After all, as the thing in que&s;tion is a matter of mere opinion (and opinions vary as new circum&s;tances ari&s;e) he cannot conceive that his opinion upon the force of words can be of much con&s;equence; and ina&s;much as the preci&s;e words of the &s;aid decla|ration cannot be a&s;certained by the Board, he humbly moves to the con&s;ideration of the honorable Board&mdash;Whether the Report afore&s;aid would not &s;tand as well without the whole clau&s;e.</P>
<P>Another paragraph in the Report which your petitioner a&s;ked leave to explain him&s;elf upon, is that, wherein it is &s;ugge&s;ted, that
<PB N="13" REF="011737_0015_0F8870DCA10A9288">
there might be a mutual corre&s;pondence and communication between per&s;ons here, with regard to the &s;everal depo&s;itions publi&s;hed in the &s;ame pamphlet.&mdash;With regard to which your petitioner can with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity declare, that he never &s;aw or knew any thing concerning either one of the other depo&s;itions contained in the &s;aid pamphlet, until he &s;aw them in the pamphlet it&s;elf a few weeks ago; nor did your petitioner know that his own depo&s;ition was ever &s;ent to England, until he &s;aw it in the &s;aid pamphlet. He gave his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor a copy of it; nor did he ever give out any other copy of the &s;ame. His Honor has declared at the Board that he &s;ent it home, and has given his rea&s;ons for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, your petitioner humbly moves to the con&s;ide|ration of the Board&mdash;Whether the Report of the Committee would not &s;tand better without this clau&s;e, as well as the other? And prays that your Honors would take &s;uch order in the premi&s;es as you &s;hall judge meet.</P>
<P>If your Honors &s;hould think fit to expunge the &s;aid two clau&s;es, your petitioner &s;hould a&s;k leave to withdraw this his repre&s;entation of the matters in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>As the honorable Board expected him to ob&s;erve upon the&s;e two points only, he will add nothing with regard to the other parts of the Report or the Re&s;olves of the Board in con&s;equence of it, ex|cept that he is not convinced that he has done any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a man of honor, or been guilty of any breach of tru&s;t: upon which points he explained him&s;elf in his petition of the 5th in&s;tant. But ina&s;much as your Honors have re&s;olved that the proceedings in this bu&s;ine&s;s
<Q>be &s;ent to Mr. <HI>Bollan,</HI> in order that he may make the be&s;t u&s;e thereof he can for the benefit of this Province</Q>

<P>THE Secretary's la&s;t Petition to the honorable Board begins with &s;hewing "that it &s;o happened he had no opportunity to &s;ee the report of your Committee, and your Honor's Re&s;olutions thereon, until &s;ometime after they had pa&s;&s;ed the Board."</P>
<P>On which your Committee would ob&s;erve, that if the Secretary had thought proper he might have been pre&s;ent, as his Deputy was, at the time the &s;aid report was made, and whil&s;t it was under con|&s;ideration, which would have given him a full knowledge of its con|tents: But that his knowing it, was in no wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to the Board's pa&s;&s;ing upon it, as the examination of the evidence on both &s;ides, and in his pre&s;ence, had been had &s;ome time before, agreeable to his petition; and as the &s;aid report, be&s;ides a &s;ummary of the evidence, and one or two incidental circum&s;tances, contained no|thing but the Committee's ob&s;ervations on that evidence, and the re|&s;olutions they recommended to the con&s;ideration of the Board. They would further ob&s;erve, that the Board make no &s;ecret of any of their proceedings: which however in this ca&s;e they might have ju&s;tly done, as the Secretary in a &s;ecret manner took minutes of what he repre&s;ents had been &s;aid in Council, and in a &s;ecret manner gave his depo&s;ition concerning it, and will doubtle&s;s in a &s;ecret man|ner, at lea&s;t without the knowledge of the Board, make repre&s;en|tations on the &s;ubject of their proceedings in this affair; which if right or wrong, the Board for that rea&s;on, can neither acquie&s;ce in, or detect.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion the Committee cannot omit taking notice of what his Honor the Lieutenant Governor ob&s;erved in Council upon the &s;aid report, a few days after its acceptance by the Board, viz. That the King had a right to know all that is at any time &s;aid or done in the privy Council, con&s;idered either as a body or as indivi|duals; that the calling in que&s;tion this right would operate to the prejudice of the Province, more than any thing that had been yet done; and that the Secretary did his duty in taking minutes, and conducting as he did.</P>
<P>As to the former part of this declaration, that the King had a right to know what pa&s;&s;ed at the Privy Council, is granted, and has never been called in que&s;tion by the Council, either in the re|port afore&s;aid, or in any of their proceedings. The King has not only a right to know, but in fact may be &s;aid to know whatever pa&s;&s;es in Privy Council, even at the time of its pa&s;&s;ing: His Maje&s;ty being a con&s;tituent part of every Privy Council, and always pre&s;ent by his repre&s;entative. There is nothing in the &s;aid report, which
<PB N="15" REF="011737_0017_0F8870DE210B07B8">
ju&s;tly be con&s;trued to call in que&s;tion that right. If &s;uch a con&s;truc|tion has been given to any part of it, it is forced and unnatural, and which the Board wholly di&s;avow. They do not therefore appre|hend, that it can in the lea&s;t degree operate to the prejudice of the Province in any re&s;pect whatever; and they humbly rely on his Ma|je&s;ty's ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s, that no &s;uch operation will be the effect of it. If his Honor had pointed out the clau&s;e capable of &s;uch a con&s;truction, they would have received it as an in&s;tance of his re|gard to the Province, and to them.</P>
<P>As to the la&s;t part of the declaration, that the Secretary did his duty in taking minutes and conducting as he did, the Committee think it needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing on this head, as the contrary is fully proved in the report afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The Secretary in the &s;aid Petition takes exception to two clau&s;es of the &s;aid report: the fir&s;t only of which needs to be noticed. It runs thus, "The Secretary him&s;elf has lately declared before the Board, that he did not conceive Mr. <HI>Tyler</HI> to mean &s;uch a preconcert|ed plan, and that he never believed any &s;uch plan had been formed."</P>
<P>The Secretary divides this clau&s;e into two parts, and makes ob|&s;ervations on each. One of the ob&s;ervations is, "that no one Gen|tleman at the Board would undertake to &s;ay, that the expre&s;&s;ion was preci&s;ely as above-mentioned:" and another is, "that he would by no means be under&s;tood even to in&s;inuate that the honorable Board meant to put any unju&s;t colouring upon his declarations."&mdash;The words, whatever they were, were &s;poken by the Secretary before the Board, not in conver&s;ation with any of the members, but by way of ob&s;ervation on one of the papers in his affair, that had been ju&s;t read to the Board.</P>
<P>Now although no one Gentleman at the Board would undertake to give the preci&s;e words u&s;ed by the Secretary on that occa&s;ion, yet divers of them at the time he fir&s;t mentioned this matter to the Board, and many of them &s;ince have declared, and they do declare, that what he &s;aid conveyed to them the &s;ame idea as the words made u&s;e of in the report, and above quoted, do convey. And not|with&s;tanding the Secretary in&s;inuates what he &s;ays he would by no means in&s;inuate, "that the Board meant to put an unju&s;t colouring on his declarations," yet the Board are wholly clear of that charge, and meant to repre&s;ent truly what the Secretary &s;aid, which they &s;till think they have done, although it may not be in the preci&s;e words &s;poken by him. But it is of &s;o little importance, whether the declaration above quoted was made or not, that the Board would have &s;uffered the Secretary's explanation of him&s;elf, to have pa&s;&s;ed unremarked on, if it had not been attended with an implied reflec|tion upon their veracity.</P>
<P>The Secretary's Petition mentions further, "that he did not know that his own depo&s;ition (containing his &s;ecret minutes afore|&s;aid) was ever &s;ent to England until he &s;aw it in the pamphlet" he refers to.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="011737_0018_0F8870DEE10CA1E0">Though the Secretary did not (&s;trictly &s;peaking) know, that his &s;aid depo&s;ition had been &s;ent to England, he could have no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to doubt it. At the time he delivered his depo&s;ition to the Lieutenant Governor, and al&s;o when his Honor applied to him for it, it is probable he was informed for what purpo&s;e it was wanted. But admitting he was not, it would be a reflection upon his un|der&s;tanding, to &s;uppo&s;e he could have any doubt, that the depo&s;i|tion was intended to be &s;ent to England. His &s;aying therefore he did not know it had been &s;ent, is neither a proof, that he did not know it was intended to be &s;ent, nor any ju&s;tification of him&s;elf for delivering it: e&s;pecially as it was done without giving the Gentle|men whom it re&s;pected, and who&s;e character, as well as that of the Province, was e&s;&s;entially affected thereby, the lea&s;t notice of it.</P>
<P>The Secretary's Petition further mentions, that "as the Board expected him to ob&s;erve upon the&s;e two points only (contained in the two clau&s;es above refered to) he will add nothing with regard to the other parts of the report, or the re&s;olves of the Board in con|&s;equence of it, except that he is not convinced, that he has done any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a man of honor, or been guilty of any breach of tru&s;t."</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved here, that when the Secretary mentioned to the Board the &s;aid two clau&s;es, he excepted to no other part of the report; and when the Board con&s;ented he &s;hould explain him&s;elf by &s;omething written upon them; he &s;aid he &s;hould confine him&s;elf to tho&s;e clau&s;es only: which was acquie&s;ced in. He was not limit|ed to them by the Board, and the &s;ugge&s;tion, that he was &s;o limited, is without foundation.</P>
<P>As to what the Secretary &s;ays, that he is not convinced he has done any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a man of honor, or been guilty of any breach of tru&s;t, the Committee would only remark, that altho' the Secretary's general character may be con&s;i&s;|tent with the character of a man of honor, yet what he has done with regard to his minutes and depo&s;ition afore&s;aid, is in the whole of it incon&s;i&s;tent with that character, and clearly involves in it a breach of tru&s;t: all which is &s;ufficiently manife&s;t by the report afore&s;aid.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, <DATE>March <HI>5, 1770.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lieutenant-Governor having &s;ummoned a Council to con|&s;ider what was proper to be done in the &s;tate of di&s;order and confu&s;ion the people are at pre&s;ent in, occa&s;ioned by the troops firing upon the inhabitants the la&s;t evening, thereby killing three or four per&s;ons and wounding others: Previous to the debate, moved, That Lieut. Colonel Dalrymple and Lieut. Colonel Carr, might have notice to attend in Council if they &s;aw fit. They attended accord|ingly, when the matter was largely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in Council; and while this was doing, a Committee of the Town de&s;ired to be admitted, who came in and delivered a me&s;&s;age, declaring it to be the unani|mous opinion of the meeting, that nothing can rationally be ex|pected to re&s;tore the peace of the Town, and prevent blood and carnage, but the immediate removal of the troops. The Com|mittee withdrew while the matter was debated in Council; and Colonel Dalrymple having &s;ignified to the Lieutenant Governor, that he was willing the 29th regiment, who had rendered them&s;elves in a &s;pecial manner obnoxious to the people by the concern they had in this unhappy affair, &s;hould be placed at the barracks at the Ca&s;tle, till he could receive orders from the General; the Lieutenant-Governor acquainted the Committee accordingly, and the Council was adjourned to the afternoon.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the Lieutenant-Governor received another me&s;|&s;age from the Town, acquainting him that it was the opinion of the meeting, con&s;i&s;ting of near 3000 people, that nothing but a total and immediate removal of the Troops would &s;atisfy the Town; Mr. Adams, one of the Committee, told Colonel Dalrymple, that if he could remove the 29th regiment, he could al&s;o remove the 14th, and that it was at his peril if he did not. The Lieutenant-Governor laid the an&s;wer of the town before the Board, who, after fully de|bating the matter, unanimou&s;ly advi&s;ed him to pray Colonel Dalrym|ple to order the Troops down to Ca&s;tle William.</P>
<P>Previous to this advice, Mr. Tyler had &s;aid, "That it was not &s;uch people as had formerly pulled down the Lieutenant-Governor's hou&s;e which conducted the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, but that they were people of the be&s;t characters among us&mdash;men of e&s;tates, and men of religion: That they had formed their plan, and that this was a part
<PB N="18" REF="011737_0020_0F8870E0610C5F78">
of it to remove the Troops out of town, and after that the Commi&s;|&s;ioners: That it was impo&s;&s;ible the Troops &s;hould remain in town; that the people would come in from the neighbouring towns, and that there would be 10,000 men to effect the removal of the Troops, and that they would probably be de&s;troyed by the people&mdash;&s;hould it be called rebellion&mdash;&s;hould it incur the lo&s;s of our charter, or be the con&s;equence what it would." Divers other gentlemen adopted what Mr. Tyler had &s;aid, by referring expre&s;ly to it, and thereupon excu&s;ing them&s;elves from enlarging. Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell of Charle&s;town and Mr. Dexter of Dedham, confirmed what he &s;aid re&s;pecting the pre|&s;ent temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the neighbouring towns; every gen|tleman &s;poke on the occa&s;ion, and unanimou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed their &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of the immediate removal of the Troops from the town, and advi&s;ed his Honor to pray that Colonel Dalrymple would order the Troops down to Ca&s;tle William; one gentleman,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gray.</NOTE> to en|force it, &s;aid, "That the Lieutenant-Governor had a&s;ked the advice of the Council, and they had unanimou&s;ly advi&s;ed him to a mea&s;ure; which advice, in his opinion, laid the Lieutenant-Governor under an obligation to act agreeably thereto." Another Gentleman<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Capt. Erving.</NOTE> pre&s;&s;ed his compliance with greater earne&s;tne&s;s, and told him, "That if after this any mi&s;chief &s;hould en&s;ue, by means of his declining to join with them, the whole blame mu&s;t fall upon him; but that if he joined with them, and Colonel Dalrymple, after that, &s;hould refu&s;e to re|move the Troops, the blame would then lie at his door." The Lieutenant-Governor all along declared, that he had no authority over the Troops; yet as the Council knew, by what had pa&s;&s;ed, that upon this de&s;ire Colonel Dalrymple would con&s;ent to remove them, He, on this emergency, told the Council, he would comply with their advice, and would de&s;ire it of him accordingly; and the Colonel declared, "That upon receiving a letter from the Lieutenant-Gover|nor to that purpo&s;e, he would do it." The&s;e declarations were made to the towns-committee, and were by them &s;aid to be reported to the town, &s;till a&s;&s;embled in town-meeting; whereupon the minds of the people appeared to be quieted.</P>
<P>The Council was adjourned to the next Morning, to &s;ee the mi|nutes made by the Secretary of this day's proceedings &s;et in order, as well as to do &s;ome other bu&s;ine&s;s that had been a&s;&s;igned over to that time.</P>
<P>The Secretary, in his draft, expre&s;&s;ed what had been &s;aid in debate, in the&s;e terms.&mdash;"Divers Gentlemen of the Council informed his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, They were of opinion, that it was the determination of the people to have the Troops removed from the town; and that this was not the &s;en&s;e of the inhabitants of the town of Bo&s;ton only, but of other towns in the neighbourhood, who &s;tood ready to come in, in order to effect this purpo&s;e, be the con&s;equence of it what it may; unle&s;s they &s;hall be withdrawn by the command|ing Officers, which, in their opinion, was the only method to pre|vent the effu&s;ion of blood, and, in all probability, the de&s;truction of
<PB N="19" REF="011737_0021_0F8870E1211085F8">
his Maje&s;ty's Troops, who mu&s;t be overpowered by numbers, which would not be le&s;s than ten to one.</P>
<P>This form was allowed &s;trictly to expre&s;s the truth, but that it would not &s;tand well on the Council Records. One of the Gentlemen on the Board prepared an amendment, as in the words following,&mdash; "That the people of this, and &s;ome of the neighbouring towns, were &s;o exa&s;perated and incen&s;ed, on account of the inhuman and barba|rous de&s;truction of a number of the inhabitants by the Troops, that they apprehended imminent danger of further blood&s;hed, unle&s;s the Troops were forthwith removed from the body of the town, which, in their opinion, was the only method to prevent it."&mdash;This amend|ment was &s;ub&s;tituted, and the minutes of the whole proceedings &s;et in order and agreed to.</P>

<P>THAT your Petitioner while attending his duty ye&s;terday in the Council-Chamber at Cambridge, took notice of a Vote of Council pa&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of a depo&s;ition &s;igned Andrew Oliver, &s;aid to have been publi&s;hed in England relative to the un|happy affair in Bo&s;ton the 5th of March la&s;t; in which Vote eight

Gentlemen of the Board who were of the Council la&s;t year were de&s;ired to draw up the &s;tate of the affair to which the &s;aid depo|&s;ition relates.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner begs leave to repre&s;ent that the &s;aid depo&s;ition appears by the tenor of it to have been made merely to vindicate the Lieutenant-Governor in de&s;iring that his Maje&s;ty's Troops might be removed to Ca&s;tle William after the fatal cata&s;trophe of that day, by &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity he was under of conceding to it, ari&s;ing from the forcible rea&s;ons urged by the Council on that occa&s;ion, which rea&s;ons may equally &s;erve to ju&s;tify the Council in advi&s;ing his Honor to that mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>That your Petitioner as holding his Commi&s;&s;ion immediately from the King, who therein expre&s;&s;es his confidence in his fidelity could not con&s;ider him&s;elf as acting in breach of tru&s;t in making &s;aid depo&s;ition, as he was called upon by the Commander in Chief who is the King's Repre&s;entative in the Province to give a true relation of the proceedings had in Council on that day, which his Honor has &s;ince declared in Council: and your Petitioner could have no appre|hen&s;ion of his betraying any of the &s;ecrets of Government, as mo&s;t if not all the proceedings of the day were had in a more public manner than u&s;ual, divers of the King's Officers having been then pre&s;ent at the de&s;ire of the Governor and Council at their debates and re&s;olu|tions in Council.</P>

<P>WHEREAS in one of the publick news-papers for the la&s;t week printed in Bo&s;ton, there appeared an Affidavit &s;igned <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> taken before Fo&s;ter Hutchin&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and &s;aid to be extracted from a pamphlet lately publi&s;hed in London, intitled, "A fair account of the late unhappy di&s;turbance at Bo&s;ton in New-England," in which affidavit, after mention made of a Council convened by order of the Lieutenant Governor and held on the fifth (in reality on the &s;ixth) day of March la&s;t (it being the next day after a number of per&s;ons had been killed and wounded by the troops firing upon them) it is, among other things, declared that Mr. Tyler, in Council, &s;aid <HI>that they, the people, had formed their plan and that this was apart of it, to remove the Troops out of Town and after that the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and that what Mr. Tyler had &s;aid was adopted by divers members of the Council, who, by referring to what Mr. Tyler had &s;aid, excu&s;ed them&s;elves from enlarging.</HI> And whereas the &s;everal members of the Council Board, who were pre&s;ent in Council on the &s;ixth and &s;eventh days of March la&s;t, have been called upon to relate to that Board what foundation there was for &s;uch a repre&s;entation as was made in the affidavit afore|mentioned, this deponent, who was one of the eight Councellors then pre&s;ent, te&s;tifies and &s;ays, that although he remembers that Mr. Tyler, on that unhappy occa&s;ion, did in &s;trong terms expre&s;s his apprehen&s;ion of imminent danger of further blood&s;hed in ca&s;e the troops &s;hould continue in the town (which appeared to this
<PB N="25" REF="011737_0027_0F8870E5A10673D8">
deponent to be likewi&s;e the apprehen&s;ion of every other member of the Council then pre&s;ent) and that mention was made by Mr. Tyler of a plan formed to remove the troops, yet this deponent cannot recol|lect that Mr. Tyler a&s;&s;erted that it was a part of the plan to remove the Commis&s;ioners al&s;o, as &s;et forth in &s;aid affidavit: And whereas the mention made by Mr. Tyler of a plan that had been formed, (con&s;idering that the interval of time between tho&s;e outrages and Mr. Tyler's narration was &s;carce &s;ufficient wherein to form &s;uch a plan and the knowledge of it to reach Mr. Tyler) may by &s;ome be under&s;tood to refer to a plan formed before tho&s;e outrages were committed, this deponent te&s;tifies that nothing &s;aid by Mr. Tyler, in his hearing, did convey to him any idea of &s;uch a plan formed pre|vious to tho&s;e outrages; and how incautiou&s;ly and madly &s;o ever &s;ome individuals highly incen&s;ed, might have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and what apprehen&s;ions &s;o ever Mr. Tyler (thro' mi&s;information or other|wi&s;e) might then have of a plan formed for removing the troops from the town, in any other way than by prevailing with their officers to remove them, this deponent verily believes that no com|bination had ever been formed, or plan concerted for the purpo&s;e of removing the troops, either in the town of Bo&s;ton or el&s;ewhere; having never heard it &s;ugge&s;ted by any other per&s;on then Mr. Tyler either then or at any time &s;ince: And whereas in the aforementioned affidavit it is a&s;&s;erted that divers members of the Council adopted what Mr. Tyler had &s;aid by referring to it, and thereby excu&s;ing them&s;elves from enlarging; (which a&s;&s;ertion plainly imports that divers members of the Council a&s;&s;ented to and adopted all that Mr. Oliver in his affidavit had repre&s;ented to have been &s;aid by Mr. Tyler relative to a plan formed to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners as well as the Troops) this Deponent declares that altho' he had the like apprehen&s;ions as Mr. Tyler had of the danger of further blood|&s;hed in ca&s;e the troops &s;hould continue in the town; yet that he never adopted any &s;entiment that a plan had been concerted for re|moving the Commis&s;ioners, or even the troops in way of compul|&s;ion; and, &s;o far at lea&s;t, as relates to the Commis&s;ioners, this de|ponent is fully per&s;uaded that no member of the Council then pre|&s;ent did adopt the &s;ame, ina&s;much as he well remembers that divers of them then declared that in their opinion the Commis&s;ioners might continue in town with all &s;afety after the troops were re|moved thence: and no one of the Council then pre&s;ent di&s;covered an opinion diver&s;e therefrom.</P>
<P>And this deponent further &s;ays, that the amendment made of the minutes of Council which had before been taken by the Secretary (as &s;aid amendment is recited in his affidavit, and which was unani|mou&s;ly agreed to by the members of Council then pre&s;ent) contains the whole of what, after full debate and mature con&s;ideration had, was by them adopted, and (together with the advice given to the Lieutenant-Governor, to u&s;e his influence that the troops might be removed) was, as this deponent apprehends, the whole that could regularly be certified by the proper officer of that Board, as they were the only Votes of Council that had pa&s;s'd upon that occa&s;ion.</P>

And this deponent further &s;ays, that upon the Lieut. Governor's a&s;king the Board, what protection there would be for the Commi&s;&s;ioners if both regiments were ordered to the Ca&s;tle, or words of the &s;ame import, he the deponent an&s;wered, that they would be as &s;afe without them, as with them; for that the people would never be &s;o mad as to offer them the lea&s;t violence, when the troops could be &s;o ea&s;ily recalled for their protection, or words im|porting the &s;ame &s;en&s;e. One Gentleman at the Board immediately &s;econded the deponent and a&s;&s;ured his Honor of their &s;afety, and added, that he would pawn his life that they &s;hould receive no in|jury, or words that conveyed the &s;ame &s;en&s;e. The deponent fur|ther &s;ays, that when Mr. Tyler &s;aid, "the people of the be&s;t cha|racters among us, men of e&s;tates, and men of religion, had formed a plan to remove the troops out of Bo&s;ton, &s;hould it be called re|bellion, &s;hould it incur the lo&s;s of the charter, or be the con&s;equence what it would," he the deponent did not under&s;tand that Mr. Tyler meant that &s;uch a plan was laid previous to the killing of the inha|bitants by the &s;oldiery, but that it was in con&s;equence of the horri|ble tran&s;actions of the evening of the fifth of March. And further that Mr. Tyler rather expre&s;&s;ed his opinion of the mea&s;ures the people (being thus exa&s;perated) would take, than his approbation of &s;uch mea&s;ures.</P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="011737_0029_0F8870E721014B88">That the&s;e Deponents, when in Council, told the Lieutenant- Governor, in the following words, or in words of the like import, "That the re&s;entment of the people in Bo&s;ton, and &s;ome of the adja|cent towns was &s;o rai&s;ed, on account of the de&s;truction of the lives of their countrymen by the Troops, who were al&s;o in &s;uch temper with re&s;pect to the inhabitants, that there was rea&s;on to apprehend, if the Troops were not removed from the town, there would be further blood&s;hed, and the people in the vicinity would in their opinion, come in to a&s;&s;i&s;t the inhabitants of the town in removing the Troops, unle&s;s they &s;hould be withdrawn by the commanding Officer."</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition of the people towards the Troops, the&s;e deponents &s;ay, was, as they did then, and do now verily believe, occa&s;ioned by the de&s;truction of their countrymen as afore&s;aid; and the&s;e depo|nents then intended that the Lieutenant-Governor &s;hould under&s;tand them to mean that the people &s;till conceived of the Troops as having a ho&s;tile de&s;ign again&s;t them: And the&s;e deponents animated with a &s;incere de&s;ire to pre&s;erve, as well the lives of the King's Troops, as of the inhabitants, did thereupon expre&s;s their &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of the immediate removal of the Troops, and pre&s;&s;ed the matter with great earne&s;tne&s;s on the Lieutenant-Governor.</P>
<P>The&s;e Deponents further &s;ay, they have very lately &s;een a depo|&s;ition &s;igned Andrew Oliver, and dated, as they &s;uppo&s;e, thro' a mi&s;take, March 5, 1770, re&s;pecting the proceedings of &s;aid Council on the 6th and 7th of March la&s;t, which is printed in the Appendix to a Pamphlet lately publi&s;hed in London, intitled, "A fair account of the late unhappy Di&s;turbance at Bo&s;ton in New-England," which depo&s;ition was taken before Fo&s;ter Hutchin&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of his Ma|je&s;ty's Ju&s;tices for the County of Suffolk, (without notice thereof previou&s;ly given to the&s;e Deponents) in which depo&s;ition it is a&s;|&s;erted, that Mr. Tyler, one of the eight members of the Council then pre&s;ent, among other things &s;aid, "that they (the people) had formed their plan, and that this was a part of it to remove the Troops out of town, and after that the Commi&s;&s;ioners," Now the&s;e Depo|nents declare, that they cannot recollect that any thing was &s;aid in Council by Mr. Tyler purporting that any plan had been formed to remove the Troops previous to their firing on the inhabitants (in which &s;en&s;e the&s;e Deponents apprehend the depo&s;ition of Mr. Oliver afore&s;aid may be taken; but the&s;e Deponents under&s;tood Mr.Tyler to mean, that the people were excited to &s;uch a mea&s;ure by the kil|ling and wounding of &s;ome of the inhabitants of the town on the evening following the 5th of March. Nor do the&s;e Deponents re|member that he mentioned any thing of a de&s;ign to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners; and the&s;e Deponents apprehend it altogether im|probable that he &s;hould have delivered &s;uch an opinion, not only as it cannot be pre&s;umed they &s;hould both have forgot it, but as it mu&s;t have been, as they conceive improved as an argument again&s;t the removal of the Troops, notwith&s;tanding all that had been &s;aid of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a removal, if the Commi&s;&s;ioners had been &s;up|po&s;ed to be in danger: and &s;uch an argument, had it been u&s;ed, the&s;e deponents are per&s;uaded, would have had great weight with the

Lieutenant-Governor, and the commanding officer of the Troops; and con&s;equently have tended to defeat the very end Mr. Tyler and they are repre&s;ented as aiming at. Be&s;ides, it would have been &s;o utterly contrary to the &s;entiments of the&s;e Deponents, that had Mr. Tyler advanced &s;uch an opinion they have no doubt it mu&s;t have produced &s;uch a di&s;pute and oppo&s;ition as could not have been for|got by any one pre&s;ent And the&s;e Deponents &s;ay, as they cannot recollect that they heard a word from Mr. Tyler of any intention to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;o neither could they have adopted &s;uch a &s;trange opinion, had it been advanced by any per&s;on whatever.</P>
<P>The&s;e deponents further declare, that the words made u&s;e of in the amendment as recited by Mr. Oliver in his depo&s;ition afore&s;aid, which were the next morning propo&s;ed in Council to be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of the terms the Secretary had u&s;ed in the minutes of Coun|cil taken the day before, the&s;e deponents then verily thought le&s;s liable to be mi&s;con&s;trued, and that by this alteration the true mean|ing and intent of the &s;everal members of the Council, in what they had the day before &s;aid to the Lieutenant-Governor of the di&s;po|&s;ition of the people, would fully and fairly appear.</P>
<P>And furthermore, the&s;e deponents declare, that, in their be&s;t judgement and firm belief, there was no intention of the people, or of the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, or of any other town of the Province, to remove the Troops, before the evening following the fifth of March la&s;t, nor at any time what&s;oever to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>

<P>The&s;e deponents further declare, that the words made u&s;e of in the amendment, as recited by the &s;aid Mr. Oliver in his &s;aid depo|&s;ition, which were the next morning propo&s;ed in Council to be &s;ub|&s;tituted in&s;tead of the terms the Secretary had u&s;ed in the minutes of Council taken the day before; the&s;e deponents then verliy thought le&s;s liable to be mi&s;con&s;trued; and that by this alteration the true meaning and intent of the &s;everal members of the Council in what they had on the preceeding day &s;aid to the Lieutenant-Governor, of the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, would fully and fairly appear.</P>
<P>And the&s;e deponents further declare, that if any other per&s;on or per&s;ons have repre&s;ented the&s;e deponents as &s;aying in &s;aid Council, or at any other time, that there was an intention of the people to effect by force the removal of the Troops, before their firing on the inhabitants as afore&s;aid, or any purpo&s;e, either prior or po&s;terior to the fifth of March la&s;t, of removing the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms, or words of the like import, or as adopting &s;uch &s;enti|ments, after having been advanced by any per&s;on whatever, &s;uch repre&s;entation is not only contrary to fact, but utterly void of all foundation.</P>
<P>And furthermore the&s;e deponents declare, that, in their be&s;t judg|ment and firm belief, no &s;uch intention or purpo&s;e of the people, or of the inhabitants of the town of Bo&s;ton, or of any other town or place in the Province, ever exi&s;ted, either with re&s;pect to the Troops or the Commmi&s;&s;ioners.</P>

&s;igned Andrew Oliver, dated March the 5th, 1770, re&s;pecting the proceedings of &s;aid Council in which depo&s;ition (the taking whereof was unknown to this deponent) it is a&s;&s;erted that the de|ponent, among other things, &s;aid that "people of the be&s;t characters among us, men of e&s;tates, and men of religion, had formed their plan, and that this was a part of it, to remove the Troops out of town, and after that the Commi&s;&s;ioners." Now this deponent de|clares, that he uttered nothing in &s;aid Council purporting that any plan had been formed to remove the Troops previous to their firing on the inhabitants as afore&s;aid; in which &s;en&s;e he apprehends that the &s;aid Mr. Oliver de&s;igned his depo&s;ition &s;hould be taken; and the deponent then meant to be under&s;tood, that the di&s;po&s;ition of the people to remove the Troops was occa&s;ioned by the killing and wounding of divers inhabitants of the town, and from the peo|ple's apprehen&s;ion that the Troops &s;till had an unfriendly de&s;ign again&s;t them.&mdash;Nor had this deponent any idea of a plan formed for the removal of &s;aid Troops until the day after the &s;hocking &s;cene on the evening of the fifth of March la&s;t.

<P>And this deponent further &s;ays, that in his be&s;t judgment and firm belief, no plan to remove the Troops before their firing on the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, or at any time what&s;oever to remove the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms ever was formed, or forming by the people, or any number of per&s;ons whatever.

<SALUTE>To the Honorable his Maje&s;ty's Council for the Province above&s;aid,</SALUTE>
Humbly &s;heweth <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI></OPENER>
<P>THAT your Petitioner ob&s;erves in the Votes of Council re|ferred to in his Petition preferred the 5th in&s;tant to this honorable Board as a branch of the Legi&s;lature, that he is charged with <HI>repre&s;enting</HI> divers Gentlemen of the Council of the la&s;t year, in a certain depo&s;ition publi&s;hed in England,
<Q>as having made &s;uch a declaration to his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, re&s;pecting a plan formed by the people to remove the King's Troops and the Commi&s;&s;ioners <HI>of the Cu&s;toms</HI> from the town of Bo&s;ton, as was likely to be attended with the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences to this Province.</Q></P>
<P>Your Petitioner hereupon begs leave to ob&s;erve to your Honors that he hath repre&s;ented Mr. Tyler <HI>only,</HI> as having made a declara|tion of that kind; and divers other Gentlemen as only
<Q>adopting what Mr. Tyler had &s;aid, by referring expre&s;sly to it, and there|upon excu&s;ing them&s;elves from enlarging.</Q></P>
<P>Before your Petitioner attempts to explain his &s;aid depo&s;ition, he hopes he may without offence be allowed to take notice, that he hath not u&s;ed the words&mdash;Commi&s;&s;ioners <HI>of the Cu&s;toms,</HI> as is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the Vote of Council, but&mdash;the Commi&s;&s;ioners <HI>only:</HI> and he the rather takes notice of this variation, becau&s;e it brings fre&s;h to his mind, how cautious he was in framing his depo&s;ition. He perfectly remembers that Mr. Tyler mentioned the Commi&s;&s;ioners, but not the Commi&s;&s;ioners <HI>of the Cu&s;toms;</HI> your Petitioner therefore did not in&s;ert tho&s;e de&s;criptive words in his depo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner apprehends that the &s;everal po&s;itive witne&s;&s;es which he hath produced to prove that Mr. Tyler &s;aid the words abovementioned, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as undoubted evidence of the fact: but he never once pretended to &s;ay that divers other Gentle|men made &s;uch a declaration, otherwi&s;e than by adopting what Mr. Tyler had &s;aid, i. e. by referring to it and thereupon de&s;iring to be excu&s;ed from enlarging.</P>
<P>He thinks he has not mi&s;under&s;tood the meaning of the word <HI>adopt.</HI> The word, as he conceives, in its primary &s;ignification intends&mdash;a per&s;on's taking another's child as his own. From hence, when one relates a &s;tory or an hi&s;torical account of facts upon the credit of another, without &s;hewing any doubt of the truth of them, he is &s;aid to adopt the &s;tory or account related by him; and in like manner he may be &s;aid to adopt the opinion of another, when he expre&s;sly refers to it without betraying a doubt about it: he does &s;o in a more e&s;pecial manner, when he refers to &s;uch opinion for his own government, or the government of others in point of practice. In this &s;en&s;e your Petitioner under&s;tood the word <HI>adopt</HI>: Had he &s;aid that divers other Gentlemen <HI>confirmed</HI> what Mr. Tyler had &s;aid, it might have been then alledged, that they were charged with vouching for the truth of facts them&s;elves, whereas the
<PB N="33" REF="011737_0035_0F8870EBA0F800A0">
word <HI>adopt</HI> &s;trictly and literally implies no more than that they &s;up+po&s;ed the truth of facts on the credit of the relator; nor did your Petitioner ever intend any thing more by it; and that upon &s;uppo&s;i|tion of the truth of the facts related, they might found their opinion.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner therefore hopes his depo&s;ition cannot be con&s;i|dered as containing any unju&s;t charge again&s;t any of the Gentlemen of the Council who referred to what had been &s;aid by another Gentleman as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Nor did your Petitioner ever apprehend that the good people of the Province in general were at all chargeable with forming any unju&s;tifiable plan. If the plan &s;aid to have been formed to remove the Troops and Commi&s;&s;ioners was to have been executed in a legal and con&s;titutional way, they would doubtle&s;s be ready to avow it them&s;elves. If it was to have been executed by violence, &s;uch plans are u&s;ually formed by a few; and if it was formed after the evening of the 5th and before noon of the 6th of March, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that there were very few concerned in the forming of it.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner never intended to convey any idea of the plan's being formed prior to the 6th of March rather than after it: He is confident that he has been preci&s;e in &s;etting down the very words u&s;ed on the occa&s;ion, without adding any con&s;truction of his own.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner will not pre&s;ume to make any other ob&s;ervations on the depo&s;itions of the Gentlemen of the Council who were con|cerned in this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ave that they are generally negative te&s;ti|monies, and &s;ome of them principally argumentative. The principal matter wherein the te&s;timony of divers of &s;aid Gentlemen differs from that of your Petitioner, appears to him to be concerning what relates to the Commi&s;&s;ioners; with regard to which, he apprehends, his depo&s;ition is fully &s;upported by the te&s;timony of di&s;intere&s;ted witne&s;&s;es then pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner drew up a memorandum of that day's proceedings, without the privity of any one, merely to a&s;&s;i&s;t his memory in future. When he was afterwards called upon by the Lieutenant-Governor for his te&s;timony concerning tho&s;e matters, he had this memorandum or narrative copied without any alteration. It does not appear to have had any influence on the mea&s;ures of government at home, as the proceedings relative to the Troops are not &s;o much as men|tioned in the Re&s;olves of the King in Council in July la&s;t: Nor has he heard of any private letter from London mentioning the &s;aid depo&s;ition as like to be attended with any pernicious con&s;equences. He therefore prays that for the rea&s;ons herein mentioned, and tho&s;e in his Petition of the 5th in&s;tant, this honorable Board will, in ju&s;tice to his character, order the &s;ame, together with the depo&s;itions he has adduced, to be lodged on the files of this Court, and take &s;uch further order for preventing any prejudice to his character on this occa&s;ion, as in equity &s;hall &s;eem meet. And your Petitioner &s;hall, as in duty bound, ever pray, &amp;c.</P>
