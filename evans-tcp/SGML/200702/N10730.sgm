<HEAD>THE CONGRESS CANVASSED: OR, AN EXAMINATION INTO The CONDUCT of the DELEGATES, &amp;c. ADDRESSED To the MERCHANTS of NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL make no apology for addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to you, the Merchants of the city of New-York, upon the pre&s;ent unhappy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of our country. My &s;ubject will nece&s;&s;arily lead me to make &s;ome remarks on your pa&s;t and pre&s;ent conduct, in this unnatural contention be|tween our parent country and us. I am duly &s;en&s;ible of what importance you are to the community, and of the weight and influence you mu&s;t have in the conduct of all our public affairs: I know that the characters of many of you are truly re&s;pectable, and I &s;hall endeavour to expre&s;s what I have to &s;ay to you, con|&s;i&s;tently with that decency and good manners which are due, not only to you, but to all mankind.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t not expect any undue complai&s;ance from <HI>me.</HI>&mdash; You mu&s;t be content with plain Engli&s;h, from a plain country|man; I mu&s;t have the privilege of calling a fig,&mdash;a Fig; an egg,&mdash;an Egg. If, upon examination, your conduct &s;hall, in any in&s;tances, appear to be weak, you mu&s;t bear to be told of it:&mdash;if wrong, to be cen&s;ured:&mdash;if &s;elfi&s;h, to be expo&s;ed:&mdash;
<PB N="4" REF="013601_0003_0F95A66C8ABD0DD0">
if ridiculous, to be laughed at:&mdash;Do not be offended if I omit to &s;ay, that if your conduct &s;hall appear to be honourable, that it &s;hall be commended. Honourable and virtuous actions want no commendation,&mdash;they &s;peak for them&s;elves: They affect not prai&s;e, but are rather di&s;gu&s;ted with it,&mdash;in&s;tead of heightening, it tarni&s;hes their lu&s;tre. If you have acted from honourable motives, from di&s;intere&s;ted principles, from true patrioti&s;m,&mdash; if ju&s;tice and prudence, and a love of your country have been the guides of your conduct, you need fear no attack, nor the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny of your actions.</P>
<P>Nor, upon the other hand, ought you to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the man, who &s;hall point out your errors, &s;uppo&s;ing you have acted wrong. To err is common,&mdash;I wi&s;h it was uncommon to per&s;i&s;t in error. But &s;uch is the pride of the human heart, that when we have once taken a wrong &s;tep, we think it an impeachment of our wi&s;dom and prudence to retreat. A kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">llen, &s;ulky ob&s;tinacy takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us; and though, in the hour of calm reflection, our hearts &s;hould condemn us, we had rather run the ri&s;k of being condemned by the world too, than own the po&s;&s;ibility of our having been mi&s;taken. Prepo&s;terous pride! It defeats the end it aims at: It degrades in&s;tead of exalting our characters, and de&s;troys that reputation which it &s;eems &s;o &s;olici|tous to e&s;tabli&s;h. To become &s;en&s;ible of our errors, and to mend them,&mdash;to grow wi&s;er by our own mi&s;takes,&mdash;to learn prudence from our own mi&s;conduct,&mdash;to make every fall a means of ri&s;ing higher in virtue,&mdash;are circum&s;tances which rai&s;e the dignity of human nature the neare&s;t to that perfection of conduct which has never erred.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly, in many in&s;tances, I &s;hall need your candour: In one particular I mu&s;t be&s;peak it. I live at a di&s;tance from the city, and vi&s;it it but &s;eldom. The opinion I have formed of your con|duct, depends, a good deal, upon report, and the common new&s;|papers.&mdash;I have, however, endeavoured to get the be&s;t infor|mation I could; and I have not the lea&s;t inclination to put unfair con&s;tructions upon your actions; and &s;hould I, in any in&s;tance, mi&s;repre&s;ent you, I will, upon good information, make all proper acknowledgments. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, and with this di&s;po&s;ition, I think I have a right to expect, that you will read this Addre&s;s without prejudice, and judge of it with im|partiality, and &s;uch a regard to truth and right, as every rea&s;on|able man ought to make the ba&s;is of his opinion in all di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and the rule of his conduct in all his actions.</P>
<P>You, &s;ometime ago, Gentlemen, joined with the other citi|zens of New-York, in &s;ending Delegates to repre&s;ent your city
<PB N="5" REF="013601_0004_0F95A66CD590D7F0">
in the Congre&s;s at Philadelphia. Let me intreat you to reflect a little upon the motives on which you then acted.&mdash;Did you expect that the Congre&s;s would con&s;ult upon, and enter into &s;ome rea&s;onable and probable &s;cheme for accommodating our unhappy di&s;putes with our mother country, and of &s;ecuring and rendering permanent our own privileges and liberties? Did you expect that they would endeavour, upon the true principles of legi&s;lation, to mark out the bounds of parliamentary authority over the colonies; on the one &s;ide a&s;certaining and &s;ecuring the liberties of the coloni&s;ts, and on the other giving full weight and force to the &s;upreme authority of the nation over all its dominions? which is the only mode of &s;ettling finally and per|manently our di&s;putes with Great-Britain.&mdash;Or did you expect that the Congre&s;s would throw all into confu&s;ion,&mdash;revile and trample on the authority of Parliament, and make our breach with the parent &s;tate a thou&s;and times more irreparable than it was before?</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the Congre&s;s have not acted in this manner is to talk <HI>childi&s;hly,</HI> without either rea&s;on or good &s;en&s;e on your &s;ide. Look at the Suffolk Re&s;olves, from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, which they adopted, "<HI>approved and recommended.</HI>"&mdash;Look into their addre&s;&s;es to the people of Great-Britain, to the inhabitants of the colonies in general, and to tho&s;e of Quebec in particu|lar. They all tend, under cover of &s;trong and lamentable cries about liberty, and the rights of Engli&s;hmen, to degrade and contravene the authority of the Briti&s;h parliament over the Bri|ti&s;h dominions; on which authority the rights of Engli&s;hmen are, in a great mea&s;ure, founded; and on the due &s;upport of which authority, the liberty and property of the inhabitants, even of this country, mu&s;t ultimately depend. They all tend to rai&s;e jealou&s;ies to excite animo&s;ities, to foment di&s;cords be|tween us and our mother country. Not a word of peace and reconciliation,&mdash;not even a &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ion:&mdash;No conce&s;|&s;ions are offered on our part,&mdash;nor even a po&s;&s;ibility of their treating with us left. The parliament mu&s;t give up their whole authority,&mdash;repeal all the acts, in a lump, which the Congre&s;s have found fault with, and tru&s;t, for the future, to our humour, to pay them ju&s;t &s;o much &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as we &s;hall think con|venient.</P>
<P>To me, it is a difficult ta&s;k to account for the conduct of tho&s;e gentlemen who were delegated from your city. Their characters, their &s;tations, their abilities, their knowledge of the rights of mankind, and of the laws and con&s;titution of their country, all concurred to rai&s;e my expectations, that they would
<PB N="6" REF="013601_0005_0F95A66DAA78A670">
have been of principal advantage in the congre&s;s, by moderat|ing and keeping within bounds the fiery intemperate zeal, which it was too apparent, many of the Delegates carried with them to that a&s;&s;embly. Cruelly was I di&s;appointed, when the account was confirmed, that the congre&s;s had <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> adopted the <HI>Suffolk Re&s;olves.</HI> Chagrined and vexed, I waited impatiently for their whole proceedings. Their proceedings, at length ap|peared,&mdash;and unhappily, the names of every Delegate from this province, one only excepted, who, I have been &s;ince in|formed, was ab&s;ent, appeared at the bottom of their ill-con|certed a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t leave it to the&s;e gentlemen to account for their own conduct: But, at the &s;ame time, mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that if what is whi&s;pered abroad be true, they are highly concerned to vindi|cate their conduct to the public. I do not choo&s;e to make my|&s;elf accountable for tran&s;ient whi&s;perings, and vague reports. It is &s;aid, however, that &s;ome matters were <HI>run</HI> upon them.&mdash; I u&s;e the very phra&s;e that was made u&s;e of to me,&mdash;that they unfortunately agreed, before they proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s, that neither <HI>di&s;&s;ent</HI> nor <HI>prote&s;t</HI> &s;hould appear on their minutes,&mdash;that by this agreement their hands were tied, and they were obliged, in honour, to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation, and give their voice in con|firmation of all the proceedings.&mdash;Let the&s;e Gentlemen, how|ever, remember, that though they might unfortunately, and imprudently have <HI>tied up their own hands,</HI> yet that their <HI>feet</HI> were at liberty; and that when they found the Congre&s;s were taking an undue advantage of them, and were driving matters to &s;uch a dreadful extremity, they ought, in ju&s;tice to them|&s;elves and the public, to have walked off, and have <HI>left</HI> the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The conduct of the New-England Delegates does not appear to me &s;o hard to explain. It is well known that the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, have carried their oppo&s;ition to the Briti&s;h government, to the mo&s;t daring heighth. They &s;et the exam|ple to the other colonies, of de&s;troying the property of their fellow &s;ubjects, the Ea&s;t-India Company, in open defiance of the laws of the empire, to which they owed &s;ubjection, of the laws of the province in which they lived, and of the general laws of humanity.&mdash;They have wre&s;ted the command of the militia from his Maje&s;ty's Governor,&mdash;they have pre&s;cribed the legal Trea&s;urer of the province&punc; and without any cour&s;e of law, proclaimed him a "traitor to the &s;tate;"&mdash;they are forming and di&s;ciplining regiments, providing ammunition and trains of artillery, to oppo&s;e the King's troops;&mdash;they have &s;hut up, and
<PB N="7" REF="013601_0006_0F95A66F670DD168">
rendered u&s;ele&s;s the legal courts of ju&s;tice;&mdash;they have, by mobs and riots obliged many officers of the crown to re&s;ign their em|ployments;&mdash;and in a variety of other in&s;tances have behaved them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, as to de&s;erve the epithet of <HI>rebel|lion.</HI> The extravagancy of their demands, and of their con|duct, are &s;uch, that no per&s;ons can attempt to vindicate them without giving up all preten&s;ions to common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor does this behaviour of the people of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts appear to be the effect of any &s;udden emergency, but of preme|ditated de&s;ign:&mdash;The three-penny duty on tea, they complied with, and imported near two thou&s;and che&s;ts, embarra&s;&s;ed with it. But finding unea&s;ine&s;s and complaints in this province, New Jer&s;ey, and Penn&s;ylvania, on account of that duty; and their a&s;&s;embly, being engaged with their governor, in &s;ome po|litical di&s;putes, which awakened their republican principles; they &s;eem to have thought it a proper time to try, how far the other colonies could, by art, and management, be induced to take part with them. They knew, that while all remained in peace and quietne&s;s, they could do nothing. If the other co|lonies received their motions coolly, they could recede; if warmly, they could advance the farther.</P>
<P>The unlucky &s;tep that was taken at home, of &s;ending Tea, belonging to the Ea&s;t-India company, to be &s;old here, increa&s;ed our di&s;content, as it added the dread of a monopoly, to the hard|&s;hip of which we already complained, of having three-pence &s;terling exacted upon every pound of Tea imported into the co|lonies. This was a time not to be neglected by the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts people. Unhappily, the fir&s;t &s;hip, with the companies Tea arrived in <HI>their</HI> harbour. In&s;tead of &s;uffering the Tea to be landed and &s;tored, and of &s;hewing their patrioti&s;m in not buying and u&s;ing it, they took the fatal re&s;olution of de&s;troying it. Having executed their ra&s;h purpo&s;e, they waited awhile to &s;ee what effect it would have in the other colonies. Finding them|&s;elves abetted and applauded by the more furious and fiery zea|lots among tho&s;e people in the neighbouring governments, who have dignified them&s;elves, and di&s;honoured the phra&s;e, by &s;tiling them&s;elves SONS OF LIBERTY, they became more turbulent and unruly; and &s;purned all the advice of the more moderate and more worthy part among them&s;elves, of offering to make re|&s;titution for the damages they had done.</P>
<P>Perceiving that the Tea-&s;hips had been obliged to return from Philadelphia and New-York, without being &s;uffered to en|ter their ports, and that the contagion of their ill example had &s;pread as far as the latter city, and had, in a lawle&s;s riotous man|ner,
<PB N="8" REF="013601_0007_0F95A66FCF600518">
brought de&s;truction on the Tea, imported by Captain <HI>Chambers,</HI> they advanced a &s;tep farther. They, at fir&s;t he&s;itat|ingly, afterwards more openly, propo&s;ed a Congre&s;s of Dele|gates, to meet at Philadelphia, about the fir&s;t of September. Many moderate people, who wi&s;hed nothing &s;o much as a hearty reconciliation, and firm union with Great-Britain, eagerly em|braced and helped forward the de&s;ign. The Sons <HI>of Liberty,</HI>&mdash; N. B. I u&s;e the phra&s;e only through courte&s;y,&mdash;exulted and applauded the &s;cheme in &s;uch extravagant terms, that it was enough to make one think, that they imagined, that God him|&s;elf could &s;ave their liberties in no other way. All the wi&s;dom of the continent was to be drawn together in a <HI>focus</HI> at Philadel|phia, like the rays of light in a burning-gla&s;s. <HI>There</HI> a regular American con&s;titution was to be &s;ettled, and our liberties and privileges fixed on a foundation &s;o &s;table, that neither Lord North, nor Old Time him&s;elf, &s;hould ever make any impre&s;&s;ion on them.</P>
<P>Many people, however, expected no good from this propo&s;ed Congre&s;s. They fore&s;aw that few, except the wrong-headed, blu&s;tering people among the &s;ons of liberty, and the more &s;ly favourers of an American Republic, would give them&s;elves much trouble about the election of Delegates, unle&s;s it were the vain and pragmatical, of no political principles, who hoped to ri&s;e into &s;ome degree of con&s;equence, from helping forward a pro|ject that had the popular cry in its favour. However ill-grounded the&s;e apprehen&s;ions were thought to be at that time, experience hath &s;hewn that they were but too well founded.</P>
<P>Even in this province, many undue and unfair advantages were taken. I &s;ay nothing of the election in the city, for I know little about it. But when you had cho&s;en your Delegates, the &s;upervi&s;ors in the &s;everal counties were applied to by the committee of your city, if I under&s;tood the matter right, to call the people together, and to choo&s;e committees; which com|mittees were to meet in one grand committee; and this grand committee of committes were to choo&s;e the Delegates for the county; or to declare their approbation of the New-York De|legates: And if any county or di&s;trict did not meet and choo&s;e their committee, it was to be taken for granted, that they ac|quie&s;ced in the New-York choice.</P>
<P>Here, Gentlemen, an unfair advantage was taken. You had no right to dictate to the counties in what manner they &s;hould proceed. You had no right to &s;uppo&s;e that tho&s;e di&s;tricts, or tho&s;e people who did not a&s;&s;emble, were in your favour. The contrary ought to have been &s;uppo&s;ed; and you ought to have
<PB N="9" REF="013601_0008_0F95A6708DF19480">
con&s;idered tho&s;e people and di&s;tricts who did not a&s;&s;emble, as not choo&s;ing to have any Delegates in Congre&s;s at all. The people of your city can ea&s;ily a&s;&s;emble; they have but a &s;hort walk to the city-hall or coffee-hou&s;e. But it is not ea&s;y to a&s;|&s;emble the people of a country-di&s;trict. Be&s;ides, it is well known by all tho&s;e, who know any thing of human nature, that tho&s;e people who are fond of innovations in government, and of ren|dering them&s;elves con&s;picuous in their neighbourhood, would be mo&s;t likely to attend on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. And &s;o it according|ly happened; for it is notorious that in &s;ome di&s;tricts only three or four met and <HI>cho&s;e them&s;elves</HI> to be a committee on this mo&s;t important occa&s;ion. So that, taking the whole province toge|ther, I am confident, your Delegates had not the voice of an hundreth part of the people in their favour.</P>
<P>You may &s;ay that the people might have a&s;&s;embled; and if they did not, their &s;ilence was to be taken for their con&s;ent. Not &s;o fa&s;t, gentlemen. That they might have a&s;&s;embled, I know; but had <HI>your</HI> committee, or <HI>their</HI> own &s;uperiors, any right to <HI>call</HI> them together? Were they under any obligations to obey &s;uch notifications, as a &s;uperior's adverti&s;ement, founded on the au|thority of a New-York committee? You know they were not, and becau&s;e they did not choo&s;e to obey it, mu&s;t their rights and privileges be given up, to be torn, and mangled, and tramp|led on by an enthu&s;ia&s;tic congre&s;s? Whatever you, gentlemen, may think of the matter, or whatever my fellow-countrymen may think of it, <HI>I</HI> di&s;dain &s;uch abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to your com|mittee, or your delegates, or congre&s;s&punc; <HI>I</HI> will not hold <HI>my</HI> rights and privileges on &s;o precarious a tenure.</P>
<P>I do not recollect the preci&s;e mode in which the delegates were generally cho&s;en in the other colonies. If it was in a manner &s;imilar to that in which their election was conducted in this pro|vince, the &s;ame objections may be made to it. But here I ex|pect an outcry of exultation and triumph.
<Q>The Delegates from &s;everal of the governments,</Q>
cry the deep-throated &s;ons of liberty
<Q>were appointed by their ASSEMBLIES; by the true and legal repre&s;entatives of the people; and therefore were the true and legal delegates of the people.</Q>
I hear you, gentlemen; and while I hear you, I pity your ignorance, tho' I am a&s;toni&s;hed at your impudence. It would be much to your advantage if you would learn a little common &s;en&s;e, if you would furni&s;h your&s;elves with &s;ome &s;mall degree of under&s;tanding, be|fore you &s;et up to manage the affairs of government, and to de|cide &s;o very peremptorily upon the rights and liberties of your fellow-&s;ubjects. Learn to view things in their true light; to
<PB N="10" REF="013601_0009_0F95A67161C5DBD8">
con&s;ider them according to their real natures, and to &s;peak of them with propriety; and then you <HI>will</HI> be heard and attended to. But a mi&s;guided fancy, a heated imagination, will only hurry you into contempt. Noi&s;e and blu&s;tering may make you appear of &s;ome con&s;equence in a tavern or ale-hou&s;e: Loud cries of liberty may catch the ignorant, and beguile the unwary: <HI>Tar and fea|thers</HI> may &s;ilence the pu&s;illanimous: But if you would ri&s;e into real dignity, and merit the e&s;teem of your fellow &s;ubjects, in &s;ettling the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted &s;tate of our country, you mu&s;t ob|tain a knowledge of the fir&s;t principles at lea&s;t, of civil govern|ment; from <HI>them</HI> you mu&s;t deduce your rea&s;onings; to <HI>them</HI> you mu&s;t conform your conduct.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider now, and tell me, what right or power has any a&s;|&s;embly on the continent to appoint delegates, to repre&s;ent their province in &s;uch a congre&s;s as that which lately met at Phila|delphia? The a&s;&s;emblies have but a delegated authority them|&s;elves. They are but the repre&s;entatives of the people; they cannot therefore have even the &s;hadow of right, to delegate that authority to three or four per&s;ons, even &s;hould the&s;e per&s;ons be of their own number, which were delegated by the people to their whole body conjunctively. Delegates, &s;o appointed, are, at be&s;t, but delegates of delegates, but repre&s;entatives of repre|&s;entatives. And whatever a&s;&s;embly hath acted in this manner, hath betrayed the rights and privileges of the people whom they repre&s;ented. It has exerci&s;ed a power which it never received from the people, but which it has u&s;urped over them; and in|&s;tead of commendations and applau&s;e, it de&s;erves only cen&s;ure and reproach. Be&s;ides,</P>
<P>The people are not bound by any act of their repre&s;entatives, till it hath received the approbation of the other branches of the legi&s;lature. No delegates, therefore, can in any <HI>true</HI> &s;en&s;e be called the <HI>repre&s;entatives of a province,</HI> unle&s;s they be appointed by the joint act of the whole legi&s;lature of the province. When, therefore, the delegates at Philadelphia, in the preamble to their Bill of rights, and in their letter to his Excellency General Cage, &s;tiled their body "a full and free repre&s;entation of&mdash;" "all the colonies from Nova-Scotia to Georgia," they were guilty of a piece of impudence which was never equalled &s;ince the world began, and never will be exceeded while it &s;hall con|tinue.</P>
<P>Nor is it clear to me, that the legi&s;lature of any province have a power of appointing delegates to &s;uch a congre&s;s as lately met at Philadelphia. I am certain no provincial legi&s;lature can give them <HI>&s;uch</HI> powers as were lately exerci&s;ed at Philadelphia.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="013601_0010_0F95A6720C893698">The legi&s;lative authority of any province cannot extend far|ther than the province extends. None of its act, are binding one inch beyond its limits. How then can it give authority to a few per&s;ons to meet other per&s;ons, from other provinces, to make rules and laws for the whole continent? In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and the four New England colonies, might make laws to bind Philadelphia, New-Jer&s;ey and New-York: that is&mdash;they might make laws who&s;e opera|tion &s;hould extend farther than the authority by which they were enacted, extended. Before &s;uch a mode of legi&s;lation can take place, the con&s;titution of our colonies mu&s;t be &s;ubverted, &amp; their pre&s;ent independency on each other mu&s;t be annihilated. And after it was accompli&s;hed, we &s;hould be in a &s;ituation a thou&s;and times wor&s;e, than our pre&s;ent dependance on Great-Britain, &s;hould all the difficulties we complain of be real, and all the grievances &s;ome people affect to fear, fall upon us.</P>
<P>But it is time to attend upon the congre&s;s, and con&s;ider their proceedings. However cho&s;en, or however appointed, on Sep|tember the fifth, 1774, the delegates met in a Grand Continen|tal Congre&s;s at Philadelphia, and became the object of Grand Continental Attention. For a con&s;iderable time, they affected the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy. Their doors were &s;hut, their whole pro|ceedings were involved in privacy and darkne&s;s. Nothing tran&s;|pired, nothing was heard; but that Mr.&mdash;, I forgot his name, was continually po&s;ting from Bo&s;ton to Philadelphia, and from Philadelphia to Bo&s;ton. We plea&s;ed our&s;elves with the thoughts that all our grievances would now be decently and fairly repre&s;ented, all our unhappy di&s;putes with our mother-country adju&s;ted and &s;ettled, and every po&s;&s;ibility of future conten|tion obviated, by the joint wi&s;dom, prudence and moderation of all the colonies. Like the country people in the fable, we &s;tood all attentive to the <HI>throes</HI> and <HI>pangs</HI> of the <HI>labouring</HI> mountain, &mdash;agape, with&punc; the expectation of &s;ome mighty matter to be produced at the birth. I would to God our expectations, like theirs, had ended in laughter and merriment;&mdash;But ala&s;s! the <HI>labour</HI> of the congre&s;s produced, not a &s;illy mou&s;e, to make us laugh, but a venomous brood of &s;corpion, to &s;ting us to death.</P>
<P>During that my&s;terious period of &s;ilence, when they kept the whole continent in &s;u&s;pence, they &s;eem to have been in the &s;tate of a man who is determined upon &s;ome hazardous enterprize, but not having courage enough to &s;et about it cooly and deli|berately, is obliged to wait till accident, or his own efforts have rai&s;ed his pa&s;&s;ions to a proper degree of fury: Or, like the in|habitants of New-Zealand, before they attack their enemies,
<PB N="12" REF="013601_0011_0F95A672E92CB1F8">
they found it nece&s;&s;ary to animate them&s;elves by &s;inging their war &s;ong, exerci&s;ing their lances, and brandi&s;hing their patoo-patoos, that they might work them&s;elves up into &s;uch a &s;tate of frenzy, as &s;hould apparently le&s;&s;en the danger of tho&s;e de&s;pe|rate mea&s;ures, which they were already determined to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The people of Bo&s;ton &s;eem attentively to have regulated their conduct in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hould have the greate&s;t tendency to inflame the minds of the congre&s;s when it &s;hould meet. While the members of that a&s;&s;embly were drawing together at Phila|delphia, a report was &s;pread from Bo&s;ton that the navy and ar|my had attacked the town. Po&s;ts were di&s;patched with the mo&s;t ha&s;ty &s;peed, from town to town, till the dreadful tidings arrived at Philadelphia. In New-England, all was hurry and confu&s;ion, "the pulpit-drum eccle&s;ia&s;tic," &s;pread the alarm through Con|necticut. They flew to arms, and marched off to attack the troops of <HI>that King</HI> who&s;e <HI>faithful and loyal &s;ubjects</HI> they have re|peatedly declared them&s;elves to be; tho&s;e very troops, which were employed in the &s;upport of his government, and in the protection of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>This fal&s;e alarm an&s;wered two purpo&s;es. It tried the temper of the other New-England colonies, and convinced the Bo&s;ton people, that they were ready to join them in their mo&s;t extra|vagant &s;chemes,&mdash;to ru&s;h headlong with them down the preci|pice of rebellion. It &s;erved al&s;o to inflame the congre&s;s, and to prepare the way for another Bo&s;ton manoeuvre</P>
<P>The county of Suffolk, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, had, on the &s;ixth and ninth of September, entered into a &s;et of re&s;olves, by which the authority of the government of Great-Britain was denied, the courts of ju&s;tice &s;hut up, his Maje&s;ty's coun&s;ellors, who did not re&s;ign their places by a day &s;et them, viz. September 20th, were declared to be
<Q>ob&s;tinate and in|corrigible enemies to their country.</Q>
The command of the militia taken from the King, and lodged in the people; with &s;everal other po&s;itions and declarations equally &s;editious and rebellious. It was a matter of great con&s;equence to the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;chemes, to get the&s;e re&s;olves ratified, and confirmed by authority of the congre&s;s. Now was the lucky time, the criti|cal minute. Their pa&s;&s;ions were up, their rea&s;on di&s;turbed, their judgment di&s;torted; with the mo&s;t incon&s;iderate ra&s;hne&s;s they took the fatal re&s;olution of adopting
<Q>approving and re|commending</Q>
the conduct of the Suffolk people, contained in their re&s;olves of the 6th of September; thereby making tho&s;e rebellious re&s;olves, as far as in them lay, the act and deed of all
<PB N="13" REF="013601_0012_0F95A6773344ADF8">
his <HI>Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects, in all the colonies, from Nova Scotia to Georgia.</HI></P>
<P>It is not my de&s;ign to con&s;ider minutely this adopted brat of the congre&s;s&mdash;the Suffolk re&s;olves.&mdash;Every per&s;on who wi&s;hes a reconciliation with Great-Britain; who de&s;ires to continue under her dominion and protection; who hopes to enjoy the &s;e|curity of law and good government, and to tran&s;mit our pre|&s;ent free and happy con&s;titution untainted and uncorrupted to his po&s;terity; mu&s;t condemn and abhor them. Nor will I enter on a particular examination of the other productions of the congre&s;s. To point out and animadvert on every thing in their addre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. which de&s;erved cen&s;ure, would require a volume; nor would my patience hold out through &s;o dirty a road, though I &s;hould find &s;carce any thing to impede my pro|gre&s;s; but po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions, without proof; declamations, without argument; and railing, without mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>My bu&s;ine&s;s is to detect and expo&s;e the fal&s;e, arbitrary, and tyrannical PRINCIPLES upon which the Congre&s;s acted, and to point out their fatal tendency to the intere&s;ts and liberties of the colonies.</P>
<P>It was the general opinion and expectation of tho&s;e people I conver&s;ed with, that the congre&s;s would form &s;ome rea&s;onable and probable &s;cheme of accommodating our unhappy di&s;putes with the mother country, and of &s;ecuring our own rights and liberties; and that in order to make our union with Great-Britain durable and permanent, they would endeavour to mark out the limits of parliamentary authority over the colonies; a&s;|certaining, on the one hand, the liberties of the colonies, and on the other, giving full weight to the &s;upreme authority of the nation over all its dominions. Had they attempted this, they would have done &s;omething towards accompli&s;hing the im|portant bu&s;ine&s;s on which they a&s;&s;embled. Though they might have executed it in an imperfect manner, it might probably have &s;erved for &s;omething to build upon; it would have been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed here and at home; its errors pointed out; its ad|vantages explained; its inconveniences obviated; and future improvements might have made it of real utility: At lea&s;t, they would, by this conduct, have &s;hewn their attention to the intere&s;ts of the colonies, and would, even on that account, have de&s;erved their regard; but they did nothing like this, on the contrary, they &s;pent near, or quite, two months, in approving and commending the mad proceedings of the people of Bo&s;ton, and writing inflammatory addre&s;&s;es to the people of Great-Bri|tain, Quebec, and the other provinces; and in exerci&s;ing <HI>an a&s;&s;umed power of legi&s;lation.</HI></P>

<P>I beg your pardon, Gentlemen, for treating &s;o &s;erious a &s;ub|ject with ridicule. Look back, I be&s;eech you, upon the con|duct of the Congre&s;s&mdash;con&s;ider what a &s;tate they have brought you into&mdash;view well the difficulties that &s;urround you. Perhaps you may be tempted to make light of them, and without much reflection, to &s;ay, that <HI>all will be well.</HI> But remember;&mdash;your liberties and properties are now at the mercy of a body of men unchecked, uncontrouled by the civil power. You have cho&s;en your committee;&mdash;you are no longer your own ma&s;ters:&mdash;you have &s;ubjected your bu&s;ine&s;s, your dealings, your mode of living, the conduct and regulation of your families, to <HI>their</HI> prudence and di&s;cretion. The public laws of the province are &s;uper&s;eded by the laws of the Congre&s;s. The government of your city is, in a great mea&s;ure, taken out of the hands of the magi&s;trates; they cannot do their duty for the want of that &s;upport which all good men ought to give them:&mdash;Violence is done to private property, by riotous a&s;&s;emblies, and the rioters go unpuni&s;hed; nay more;&mdash;are applauded for tho&s;e very crimes which the laws of the government have forbidden, under &s;evere penalties.</P>
<P>You &s;eem to think your&s;elves perfectly &s;afe and &s;ecure, becau&s;e your committee con&s;i&s;ts of virtuous and hone&s;t men, and <HI>they will</HI> not hurt you. I have no inclination to detract from the virtue, or to impeach the hone&s;ty of the gentlemen of the committee. I hope their future conduct will ju&s;tify your good opinion of them. It is be&s;t however to &s;ee the end of their committee-&s;hip, before you give them the &s;anction of your approbation.&mdash;But is it then come to <HI>this?</HI>&mdash;Your committee <HI>will</HI> not hurt you. Are you content to have your liberty and property dependent on the <HI>Will</HI> of the committee? <HI>You</HI> that &s;purned at the thought of hold|ing your rights on the precarious tenure of the <HI>will</HI> of a Briti&s;h mini&s;try, as you have been plea&s;ed to &s;peak; or of a Briti&s;h Parliament, can <HI>you</HI> &s;ubmit to hold them on as precarious a tenure, the <HI>will</HI> of a New-York committee, of a continental congre&s;s?</P>
<P>You cannot, I think, want conviction, that your liberty and property are made &s;ubject to the laws of the Congre&s;s, and the will of the committee.

Can't they <HI>&s;pare</HI> &s;ome &s;mall portion of that wealth, which is now pouring in upon them from the army and navy, for &s;o good a purpo&s;e? Or will not the labour of the poor &s;upport them now, as well as formerly? Mu&s;t they command the wealth of the continent, to ornament their town, and render it more commo|dious? Do they expect a <HI>literal</HI> completion of the promi&s;e, that the <HI>Saints &s;hall inherit the earth?</HI> In my con&s;cience, I believe they do. Nor can I, on this occa&s;ion, help recollecting the ob|&s;ervation of a queer fellow &s;ome time ago.

<P>I pretend not to a right of dictating to you; you have my free con&s;ent to di&s;po&s;e of your money as you plea&s;e.

It is true, in the Briti&s;h government, for the greater &s;ecurity of the &s;ubject, all money-bills mu&s;t take their ri&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Commons; nor will the commons, &s;uffer the Lords or the King to amend or alter a money-bill: Not|with&s;tanding which, it has no more force than an old almanack, and will rai&s;e no more money, till it has pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Lords, and received the Royal A&s;&s;ent: That is, till it has receiv|ed the &s;anction of the <HI>whole legi&s;lature,</HI> and become one of the <HI>Laws of the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>After all, there is &s;omething, to me, very my&s;terious in the conduct of the congre&s;s on this point; and if I &s;hould not ex|pre&s;s my&s;elf clearly on it, I mu&s;t be forgiven; and if I am not, I don't care much about it.&mdash;The congre&s;s &s;eem to me, to oblige a man to give the profits of his goods to the Bo&s;ton poor, whe|ther he <HI>will</HI> or <HI>not</HI>; and at the &s;ame time to oblige him to be <HI>wiling</HI> to do &s;o, even <HI>again&s;t</HI> his <HI>will.</HI>&mdash;They &s;eem to oblige

So that &s;hould any importer be &s;o unfortunate as to have the arrival of his goods delayed, by any accident, till the beginning of De|cember, he will be in the &s;tate of a man, who being condemned to be hanged, by a law made after his pretended crime was com|mitted, was yet &s;o cruelly treated by his judge, as to be obliged to hang him&s;elf; or at lea&s;t, obliged, freely and willingly to give directions to &s;omebody el&s;e to perform the friendly office for him. This is too much like the &s;tory of poor Jack's hanging bou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, in the hi&s;tory of John Bull; and &s;mells mo&s;t confoundedly &s;trong of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance. <HI>You</HI> may em|brace the doctrine, gentlemen, and act upon it too, if you plea&s;e; but really it is too much for <HI>me.</HI> I cannot &s;wallow it; and if I could, I am &s;ure my &s;tomach would never dige&s;t it.</P>
<P>I hope, Gentlemen, that you want no more proof, that the regulations of the congre&s;s have, and were intended to have, the force of laws;&mdash;nor that your liberty and property are now at the mercy of your committee. Say that it is not &s;o, and we will put the matter on THIS footing:&mdash;There is not one of you that will dare to act contrary to the laws of the congre&s;s:&mdash;not one of you will run the ri&s;k of oppo&s;ing the committee in the execution of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> office lately e&s;tabli&s;hed by their High Mighti|ne&s;&s;es the Delegates.&mdash;I am very certain that you do not ALL approve of the&s;e non-importation, non-exportation, and non-con&s;umption &s;chemes. <HI>Some</HI> of you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have too much &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding not to perceive their <HI>fatal tendency.</HI> But not one of you will have courage enough to avow your &s;entiments, and oppo&s;e them. The fir&s;t of you, who&s;e goods &s;hall arrive af|ter the fir&s;t of December, will, with unwilling &s;teps, march willingly to the committee, your new ma&s;ters, and give <HI>Direc|tions</HI> to have them di&s;po&s;ed of, ju&s;t as <HI>they</HI> &s;hall plea&s;e to order. So you will act, and I know the rea&s;on yon will a&s;&s;ign for it,&mdash; You'll &s;ay, your <HI>honour</HI> is engaged;&mdash;that you con&s;ented to &s;end Delegates to the congre&s;s,&mdash;and that you promi&s;ed to abide by, and
<PB N="20" REF="013601_0019_0F95A67D4C5A3370">
ob&s;erve all their determinations and laws.&mdash;This indeed was unfortunate: It was much the &s;ame conduct with his, who &s;wore to <HI>etc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">eteras.</HI> But let us examine how far your honour is <HI>really</HI> engaged by &s;uch a promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Government was intended for the &s;ecurity of tho&s;e who live under it;&mdash;to protect the weak again&s;t the &s;trong;&mdash;the good again&s;t the bad;&mdash;to pre&s;erve order and decency among men, preventing every one from injuring his neighbour. Every per|&s;on, then, owes obedience to the laws of the government under which he lives, and is obliged in honour and duty to &s;upport them. Becau&s;e, if <HI>one</HI> has a right to di&s;regard the laws of the &s;ociety to which he belongs, <HI>all</HI> have the <HI>&s;ame</HI> right; and <HI>then</HI> government is at an end. Your honour was therefore previou&s;ly engaged to the government under which you live, be|fore you promi&s;ed to abide by the determinations of the con|gre&s;s. You had no right to make a promi&s;e implicitly to obey all their regulations, before you knew what they were, and whe|ther they would interfere with the public laws of the government, or not. And you are &s;o far from being bound in honour to <HI>obey</HI> any determinations of the congre&s;s, which interfere with the laws of the government, that you are really bound in honour to <HI>op|po&s;e</HI> them. Now, a little con&s;ideration will render it evident, that there is no &s;uch thing as carrying the regulations of the con|gre&s;s into execution, without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the known laws, and contravening the legal authority of the government:&mdash;without injuring and oppre&s;&s;ing your neighbours, who have as good a right to the protection of the laws, as <HI>you</HI> have.</P>
<P>Let it al&s;o be con&s;idered, that as no man has a legal right to do what the laws forbid, &s;o every man has a legal right to do what they permit.</P>
<P>Now, by enforcing an ob&s;ervance of the determinations of the congre&s;s, in this province, you abrogate, or &s;u&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">d, &s;everal of its laws, &s;ome of them e&s;&s;ential to the peace and order of the government: You contravene its authority: You take the go|vernment of the province out of the hands of the governor, council and a&s;&s;embly, and the government of the city, out of the hands of the legal magi&s;trates, and place them in a CON|GRESS, a body utterly unknown in any legal &s;en&s;e! You in|troduce a <HI>foreign</HI> power, and make <HI>it</HI> an in&s;trument of <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The laws of this government forbid all riots, all in&s;tances of violence to others, either in abu&s;ing their per&s;ons, or depriving them of their property:&mdash;They forbid us to di&s;turb or hinder any per&s;on in the pro&s;ecution of his lawful bu&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;that is, in doing what the law permits to be done.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="013601_0020_0F95A67EF968B378">Now, what law has forbidden the exportation of &s;heep? No law of the province. The farmer is permitted to &s;ell them, and the buyer to carry them off, if he plea&s;es.&mdash;But you have introduced a law of the congre&s;s, making that unlawful and impracticable which the laws of the province permit. And in carrying this regulation of the congre&s;s into execution, on a late occa&s;ion, a public law, which forbids all riots, was notori|ou&s;ly trampled upon, and a flagrant and oppre&s;&s;ive act of inju&s;|tice done to &s;everal of his Maje&s;ties &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that your honour obliges you to perpe|trate, or abet &s;uch actions? If not, it does not oblige you to conform to the regulations of the congre&s;s, or carry them into execution.</P>
<P>There is no <HI>honour</HI> but what is founded in <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Virtue.</HI> Take the&s;e away, and what is <HI>called</HI> &s;o is a mere <HI>name</HI>; it may be whim, it may be caprice, it may be pride, it may be &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s: But HONOUR it can <HI>not</HI> be.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e one of your fellow-citizens &s;hould have a parcel of goods arrive after the fir&s;t day of December, and &s;hould refu&s;e to deliver them up to the di&s;po&s;al of the committee: Are you in <HI>honour</HI> bound to compel him? In importing the goods he has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed no law of God, of nature, nor of the province. On the contrary, the laws of God, of nature, and of the pro|vince, forbid you to mole&s;t him in the pro&s;ecution of his bu&s;i|ne&s;s. But you are introducing a regulation of the congre&s;s &s;u|perior to the laws of God, of nature; and of the province;&mdash; A regulation that &s;uper&s;edes and vacates them all. Remember, gentlemen, that honour and duty are always con&s;i&s;tent. Ho|nour can never oblige a man to do that which his duty forbids him to do. Your duty requires you to obey the laws of the government in which you live, and to &s;upport their authority: But <HI>this</HI> honour you talk of, requires you to di&s;obey the laws of the government, and to di&s;annul their authority. It is there|fore <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and not <HI>true</HI> honour which obliges you to adhere to the regulations of the congre&s;s, and to endeavour to carry them into execution; for it obliges you to act in direct oppo&s;ition to your duty, to the laws of the government, to the rights and privileges of your fellow-citizens, and to the general good of the whole province; nay, of <HI>all</HI> the provinces, from Nova-Scotia to Georgia.</P>
<P>Some carry the matter &s;till further; they plead the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, and pronounce boldly, that when any people are &s;truggling for liberty, the operation of the laws mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, cea&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the authority of government &s;ub&s;ide: And in &s;up|port
<PB N="22" REF="013601_0021_0F95A67F8CB9C830">
of this po&s;ition, they alledge the in&s;tance of that memora|ble revolution in England, which placed the great King Wil|liam on the throne. However nece&s;&s;ary that revolution may have been to &s;ecure the rights and liberties of the Engli&s;h na|tion, no man, I am per&s;uaded, who really loves his country, would wi&s;h to &s;ee it again torn by &s;uch violent convul|&s;ions as it then endured. People who talk &s;o very feelingly, and with &s;o much plea&s;ure about revolutions, and who are ever ready to ju&s;tify the mo&s;t violent, and the mo&s;t needle&s;s oppo&s;i|tion to government, by the example of the great revolution in England, &s;eem to me to be too fond of revolutions to be good &s;ubjects of any government on earth. However, let us exa|mine a little how far the nece&s;&s;ary &s;truggles for liberty will ju&s;ti|fy that violence, which puts an end to the operation of the laws, and introduces anarchy, riots, and brutal force, in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>The operation of the laws certainly ought not to cea&s;e any farther than the nece&s;&s;ary &s;truggles for liberty require. A &s;mall &s;truggle will not ju&s;tify a total &s;ubver&s;ion of law and good go|vernment. A &s;truggle for liberty, however nece&s;&s;ary it may be, which can be carried on con&s;i&s;tently with the laws, and in due &s;ubordination to government, will never ju&s;tify the breach of any one law, nor oppo&s;ition to government in any in&s;tance. &mdash;To &s;peak directly to our own ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Had you, gentlemen, &s;uffered the Tea belonging to the Ea&s;t India Company, to have been landed and &s;tored, you would have been under no obligations to have bought it, or to have u&s;ed it. It might have lain till doom&s;day, and would never have hurt you or your po&s;terity. Your di&s;pute with the mother-country, about the three-penny duty, would have been conducted con&s;i&s;tently with the laws of the government, and no injury would have been done to any mortal. But this peaceable con|duct, comported not with the intemperate, fiery zeal of the <HI>Sons of Liberty.</HI> The cry <HI>then</HI> was, that there was not <HI>virtue</HI> enough in the city to prevent the Tea from being bought and u&s;ed.&mdash;A &s;trange alteration has happened in a &s;hort time.&mdash;You have <HI>now</HI> virtue enough to prevent, not only <HI>Tea</HI> from being bought and <HI>u&s;ed,</HI> but <HI>all</HI> commodities from Great-Britain and Ireland, &amp;c. from being <HI>imported.</HI> If you go on, gentlemen, your im|provements in <HI>virtue</HI> will &s;oon put you upon an <HI>exact equality</HI> with the New-England people, whom a late celebrated writer of your city &s;tiled, the <HI>mo&s;t virtuous people on earth</HI>! In&s;tead of this peaceable conduct, every violent mea&s;ure has been pur&s;ued; all means that tended to promote a reconciliation with Great-Britain,
<PB N="23" REF="013601_0022_0F95A6808B9CC358">
and to maintain the peace and order of the government in which we live, have been neglected. And to complete the folly of your conduct, you now re&s;olve to adhere to the deter|minations of the congre&s;s, thereby precluding all po&s;&s;ibility of accommodation with the mother-country, except upon our own terms, which never can be complied with, con&s;i&s;tently with the dignity of the nation: You thereby al&s;o introduce a new authority into the province, highly derogatory from, and &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the power of the legi&s;lature: You e&s;tabli&s;h a court of Inqui&s;ition, to decide, in the mo&s;t arbitrary, tyrannical and unheard-of manner, upon the liberties and properties of your fellow-&s;ubjects, over whom you have no ju&s;t or legal power: You lay an embargo upon all the produce of the farmers, and will thereby be enabled to purcha&s;e it at your own price: You have monopolized, into your own hands many of the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life, and you prevent any more from being imported; by which means you will command the pur&s;es of the good people of the province, and may extort what &s;ums you plea&s;e from them in payment for your goods: And la&s;tly, you promote and encourage riots, mobs and tumults, and make them the means of carrying into execution that abominable &s;y&s;tem of oppre&s;&s;ion which the congre&s;s have devi&s;ed for the future government of the continent.</P>
<P>All the hardships which you complain of, all the evils which you &s;ay, you fear, from the weight of parliamentary power, en|dured for a <HI>Century,</HI> would not injure this province &s;o much as this mode of conduct continued only for a <HI>twelvemonth.</HI></P>
<P>Where, I be&s;eech you, was the nece&s;&s;ity for all this &s;o glar|ing, &s;o violent an infringement of the laws of &s;ociety, and of the rights of your fellow &s;ubjects? In truth, there never was, nor is there now, any other nece&s;&s;ity than what you your&s;elves have made. Had you permitted the Tea to have been &s;tored, and only refrained from purcha&s;ing it, you might have waited for the meeting of the a&s;&s;embly, without any manner of danger to your rights and privileges: and then you might have had the grievances you complain of, con&s;idered by the true and legal repre&s;entations of the people: If they were found to be ju&s;t, they would have been repre&s;ented, and a remedy &s;ought, in a legal con&s;titutional way; without the &s;ubver&s;ion of the laws, without the oppre&s;&s;ion of individuals, and without detriment to the province.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of this rea&s;onable and manly mode of proceeding, you have, by your ra&s;h and precipitate conduct, ca&s;t a very unde&s;erv|ed odium on your repre&s;entatives, and involved the province in
<PB N="24" REF="013601_0023_0F95A68109AACAE0">
confu&s;ion and danger.&mdash;Have your repre&s;entatives neglected your intere&s;ts?&mdash;Have they given up your liberties?&mdash;Have they betrayed your rights?&mdash;Have they &s;hewn any <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> to do the&s;e things?&mdash;If not, why are they neglected? Why are they treated as though they were not worthy to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>Let it al&s;o be con&s;idered, that the a&s;&s;embly are a body known and acknowledged by the laws of the empire. Their repre&s;en|tations would be con&s;idered, their petitions or remon&s;trances attended to. The &s;upreme authority of the nation could treat with them without de&s;cending from its dignity. But the congre&s;s are a body unknown to the government. In a <HI>legal</HI> &s;en&s;e, they are no <HI>body at all.</HI> You cannot then expect, that their petitions, &s;hould they have made any, will be attended to, or their re|mon&s;trances regarded.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e, who are fond of pleading the nece&s;&s;ities of the times, in excu&s;e of the &s;ubver&s;ion of the laws, con&s;ider,&mdash;that violent and illegal mea&s;ures, even in the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;truggles for liberty, can never be ju&s;tified, till all legal and moderate ones have failed.&mdash;Suppo&s;ing therefore, that all the complaints we make again&s;t the Briti&s;h Parliament and Mini&s;try are founded in truth; and that all the evils which we fore&s;ee and foretel are really coming on us. We have no right to procede to &s;uch violent means of redre&s;s as the congre&s;s have directed, and you are executing, till the legal and con&s;titutional applications of our A&s;&s;embly have failed.</P>
<P>Let me now reque&s;t of you, gentlemen, to look back, and con&s;ider the whole of the matter, and then determine for your|&s;elves, whether you are bound by the principles of honour, of duty, or of con&s;cience, to adhere to, or carry into execution, the regulations of the Congre&s;s, to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the laws, the di&s;turbance of the peace, the oppre&s;&s;ion of the inhabitants, and the de&s;truction of the property of the province in which you live?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, are you &s;ure, that while you are &s;upporting the au|thority of the congre&s;s, and exalting it over your own legi&s;la|ture, that you are not nouri&s;hing and bringing to maturity, a grand American Republic, which &s;hall, after a while, ri&s;e to power and grandeur, upon the ruins of our pre&s;ent con&s;titution? To me the danger appears more than po&s;&s;ible. The out-lines of it &s;eem already to be drawn. We have had a grand Conti|nental Congre&s;s at Philadelphia. Another is to meet in May next. There has been a Provincial Congre&s;s held in Bo&s;ton government. And as all the colonies &s;eem fond of imitating the Bo&s;ton politics, it is very probable that the &s;cheme will &s;pread and increa&s;e; and in a little time, the <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> be completely formed.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="013601_0024_0F95A684F248B9F8">You may think this a chimera, a creature of my own brain, and may laugh at it. But when you con&s;ider circum&s;tances with a more minute attention, po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome foundation for my &s;u&s;picions may appear. That a majority of the people of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay have it in meditation to throw off their &s;ub|jection to Great-Britain, as &s;oon as a favourable &s;ea&s;on pre&s;ents, can &s;carce admit of a doubt. The independency of that pro|vince on the Briti&s;h Parliament, has been declared in expre&s;s terms. As yet they acknowlege King George the Third for their King and liege Lord;&mdash;how long they will abide by this acknowlegment is very uncertain. They are daily encroaching on the prerogatives of his crown, and the legal rights of his throne. They have wre&s;ted the militia from the command of his Governor, and are di&s;ciplining it to fight again&s;t his own troops, whom they have called <HI>military executioners,</HI> and enemies to their &s;tate. They have obliged his &s;ervants to re&s;ign their employments. They have &s;hut up his courts of ju&s;tice, di&s;|&s;olved his government, and are erecting one of their own model|ing in its room.</P>
<P>They boa&s;t of the number and valour of their men, and have given plain intimations, in the Suffolk Re&s;olves, that they will not always act on the <HI>defen&s;ive.</HI> I could enumerate more circum|&s;tances in &s;upport of my &s;u&s;picions, but the&s;e are &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Only now &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould &s;ucceed, and be|come a &s;tate independent on Great-Britain. The probable con|&s;equence would be, that the other New-England colonies would join them, and together with them, form one Republic. When once they had arrived at this height of power, How long do you &s;uppo&s;e they would remain in peace with <HI>this</HI> government? Certainly only till a fair opportunity offered to attack it with advantage. The New-England people have ever ca&s;t a wi&s;hful eye on the lands of this province. Connecticut, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, New-Hamp&s;hire, have all in their turns encroached upon them; and their encroachments have not only been very trouble&s;ome, but al&s;o very difficult to remove. A &s;tate of continual war with New-England, would be the inevitable fate of this pro|vince, till &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on our part, or conque&s;t on their part, put a period to the di&s;pute. The con&s;equences of &s;uch an event to the <HI>landed intere&s;t</HI> of this colony, need no enumeration.</P>
<P>Whenever the fatal period &s;hall arrive, in which the Ameri|can colonies &s;hall become independent on Great-Britain, a hor|rid, &s;cene of war and blood&s;hed will immediately commence. The intere&s;ts, the commerce of the different provinces will in|terfere: di&s;putes about boundaries and limits will ari&s;e. There
<PB N="26" REF="013601_0025_0F95A686A98D11D8">
will be no &s;upreme power to interpo&s;e; but the &s;word and bay|onet mu&s;t decide the di&s;pute. We, indeed, in <HI>words,</HI> di&s;claim every thought and wi&s;h of &s;eparating our intere&s;ts from hers: But in <HI>deed</HI> and <HI>fact,</HI> all the colonies from Nova-Scotia to Georgia, have run headlong into &s;uch mea&s;ures, as mu&s;t, if they prove &s;ucce&s;sful, finally break intirely our connection with her, or reduce her to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing her dominion over us, in conque&s;t.</P>
<P>To talk of &s;ubjection to the <HI>King</HI> of Great-Britain, while we di&s;claim &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Parliament of Great-Britain, is idle and ridiculous. It is a di&s;tinction made by the American Re|publicans to &s;erve their own rebellious purpo&s;es,&mdash;a gilding with which they have enclo&s;ed the pill of &s;edition, to entice the unwary coloni&s;ts to &s;wallow it the more readily down.&mdash;The King of Great-Britain was placed on the throne by virtue of an act of Parliament: And he is King of America, by virtue of being King of Great-Britain. He is therefore King of Ame|rica by act of Parliament. And if we di&s;claim that authority of Parliament which made him our King, we, in fact, reject him from being our King; for we di&s;claim that authority by which he is a King at all.</P>
<P>Let us not, Gentlemen, be led away from our duty and alle|giance, by &s;uch fanta&s;tical di&s;tinctions. They are too nice and &s;ubtil for practice; and fit only for Utopian &s;chemes of govern|ment. We have &s;o long paid attention to &s;ophi&s;tical declama|tions about liberty and property, the power of government, and the rights of the people, the force of laws and the benefit of the con&s;titution, that we have very little of any of them left among us: And if we continue to &s;upport and imitate the mad &s;chemes of our ea&s;tern neighbours, in the manner we have done, in a very &s;hort time, we &s;hall have none at all.</P>
<P>We have hitherto proceeded from bad to wor&s;e. It is time to con&s;ider and correct our conduct. As yet it has done us no good: If per&s;i&s;ted in too far, it will bring ruin upon us. It is our duty to make &s;ome propo&s;als of accomodation with our parent country: And they ought to be rea&s;onable ones&mdash;&s;uch as might be made with &s;afety on our part, and accepted with dig|nity on hers. But if we expect to oblige <HI>her</HI> to propo&s;e a recon|ciliation,&mdash;to a&s;k and intreat us to accept of &s;uch and &s;uch terms, to force <HI>her</HI> to concede every thing, while we will concede nothing:&mdash;If we are determined to proceed as we have done,&mdash; continually ri&s;ing in our demands and increa&s;ing our oppo&s;ition, I dread to think of the con&s;equence. The authority of Great-Britain over the colonies mu&s;t cea&s;e; or the force of arms mu&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="013601_0026_0F95A687ED956348">
finally decide the di&s;pute. Many Americans are hardy enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that, in &s;uch a conte&s;t, we &s;hould come off victorious; But horrid indeed would be the con&s;equence of our &s;ucce&s;s! We &s;hould pre&s;ently turn our arms on one another;&mdash;province again&s;t province,&mdash;and de&s;truction and carnage would de&s;&s;olate the land. Probably it would co&s;t the blood of a great part of the inhabitants to determine, what kind of government we &s;hould have&mdash;whether a Monarchy or a Republic. Another effu&s;ion of blood would be nece&s;&s;ary to fix a Monarch, or to e&s;tabli&s;h the common wealth.</P>
<P>But it is much more probable, that the power of the Briti&s;h arms would prevail: And then, after the mo&s;t dreadful &s;cenes of violence and &s;laughter.&mdash;CONFISCATIONS and EXECUTIONS mu&s;t clo&s;e the HORRID TRAGEDY.</P>

<P>FARMER <HI>A. W.</HI> has &s;een a pamphlet, entitled; "A full Vindication of the Mea&s;ures of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp;c." He is neither frighted nor di&s;concerted by it; nor does he find any thing in it to make him change his &s;entiments, as expre&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Free Thoughts:</HI> If the author of the Vindication has any teeth left, here is another <HI>file</HI> at his &s;ervice. <HI>A. W.</HI> would be well plea&s;ed with an opportunity of vindicating both his publi|cations at the &s;ame time, and he will wait ten days for this <HI>Friend to America</HI>'s Remarks upon the <HI>Examina|tion into the Conduct of the Delegates,</HI> which he &s;uppo&s;es will be full time enough for &s;o very accompli&s;hed a writer to <HI>ridicule</HI> all the <HI>wit</HI> contained in it. <HI>A. W.</HI> begs the author of the Vindication to con&s;ult John&s;on's Dictionary, and &s;ee whether the expre&s;&s;ion, "and his <HI>wit</HI> ridiculed," be <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> or not. He is per&s;uaded that had the <HI>Vindicator</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t &s;park of genuine <HI>wit,</HI> he would have felt both the impropriety of the expre&s;&s;ion, and the impracticability of the attempt.</P>
