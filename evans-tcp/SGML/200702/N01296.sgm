<P>But as many as received Him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name:</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN Our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour took upon him Human Nature, his De&s;ign was to make us partakers of the Divine Nature &amp; Happine&s;s: He came down from Heaven, that he might advance us to the bli&s;sful Man&s;ions of his Father's Hou&s;e, and de|liver us from the Dominion of the Powers of Darkne&s;s, into the glo|rious Liberty of the Sons of God. As this is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing which God could give, or Man receive, Our Lord's Mi&s;&s;ion was &s;up|ported with the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence, that He did not only bear a good Will to Men, but had likewi&s;e Power to be&s;tow upon them all that Life &amp; Immortality which his Go&s;pel brought to light. Ne|verthele&s;s, His Divinity being hid under the veil of his Humanity, and the Maje&s;ty of his Per&s;on being eclip&s;ed, by the meanne&s;s of his outward Appearance, neither the excellency of his Life &amp; Doctrine, nor the completion of Antient Prophecies, nor mighty Miracles perform'd by him, were able to per&s;wade the ob&s;tinate Jews to look upon him as the Promis'd Me&s;&s;ias; on the contrary, they de&s;pis'd and rejected him, and &s;trove as much as in them lay, to make their Malice and Hatred infinite, like his Love. Such entertainment did the great Founder of our Religion meet with from an ungrateful World, for who&s;e &s;ake he humbled him&s;elf here upon Earth, and en|dur'd &s;o much Mi&s;ery &amp; Affliction. Je&s;us Chri&s;t came to his Own
<PB N="2" REF="001544_0003_0FB3A8DFA1771F98">
and his Own receiv'd him not. The Conver&s;ion of the lo&s;t Sheep of the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, was his earlie&s;t and chief care; their Land was honour'd with his Sacred Birth, and to them the glad Tidings of Salvation were fir&s;t Preach'd: But tho' Chri&s;t was in a Peculiar man|ner the glory of that People, yet the beams of his Light, and the In|fluences of his Coming, extended to the Ends of the World; after a long gloomy Night of Ignorance &amp; Error, the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s ro&s;e upon all Nations, with healing under his Wings; the Partition Wall betwixt Jew &amp; Gentile was broken down, and a lively Faith qualified all People for the Divine Favour, and the participation of tho&s;e benefits which Chri&s;t purcha&s;s'd for his Church. <HI>For as many as receiv'd Him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</HI></P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon which words, I'l <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> con&s;ider the Dignity of the Per&s;on whom we are to receive.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I'l &s;hew, How we are to receive Him.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The great advantage of doing &s;o, for thereby we be|come the Sons of God.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> I'l repre&s;ent the great Sinfulne&s;s of not receiving Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And in the <HI>La&s;t Place,</HI> Draw &s;ome Inferences from the whole.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, with re&s;pect to the Dignity of his Per&s;on: We are a&s;&s;ured that Je&s;us Chri&s;t tho' he conde&s;cended to be Born in Time, yet had a Being before Time was, and Exi&s;ted from all Eternity; before he Sojourn'd in this World, He enjoy'd the Felicities of Hea|ven, which was his proper Country, and everla&s;ting Throne of the Prince of Peace. But as the fir&s;t Adam by his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion rendred him&s;elf Obnoxious to the Divine Wrath, and was bani&s;h'd from a Paradi&s;e upon Earth; &s;o the &s;econd Adam who knew no Sin, un|derwent, for a while, a voluntary Exile from the Coele&s;tial Paradi&s;e, that he might confer it upon us, and work a Reconciliation betwixt God and his Rebellious Subjects. <HI>I came forth from the Father,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and am come into the World.</HI> Again, <HI>I leave the World and go to
<PB N="3" REF="001544_0004_0FB3A8E11E54B988">
the Father,</HI> Joh. xvi. 17. In his Conver&s;ation with his Di&s;ciples he &s;et them his own Example, as the mo&s;t perfect Model of Humility, Meckne&s;s, Self-denial, &amp; other Vertues, which he taught in the Sub|lime&s;t manner; His Soul was too great to be in love with Subluna|ry Vanity, &amp; therefore he affected no Grandeur, but avoided O&s;ten|tation, and de&s;pis'd the air of Popular applau&s;e; as he was the Son of Man, he profe&s;s'd he <HI>came not to be Mini&s;tred unto, but to Mini&s;ter, and to give his Life a ran&s;om for many</HI>: Yet that we may not doubt his heavenly Extraction, We read, <HI>That the Angels Mini&s;tred unto him, and Wor&s;hip'd him: For being in the Form of God, he thought it no robbery to be equal with God; tho he made him&s;elf of no reputation, and took upon him the Form of a Servant, and was made in the likene&s;s of men.</HI> T'was the grace and favour of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>That tho' he was Rich he became Poor, that we through his Poverty might be Rich.</HI> For 'tis undeniably plain and clear that Him&s;elf cho&s;e that mean condition wherein he Lived, becau&s;e upon occa&s;ion he could work a Miracle for the payment of the tribute Money; and all Creatures were ob&s;equious to his plea&s;ure; He was Heir of all things; and tho' he had not where to lay his Head upon Earth, the glorious Man&s;ions of Heaven were di&s;po&s;ed of by him; and &s;ince he a&s;&s;ured his Di&s;ciples, He went thither to prepare a Place for them. The mo&s;t likely way to Wean their Affections from Earthly things, was to &s;hew them in his own Per&s;on, how lit|tle he valu'd the Delights and Conveniences of this pre&s;ent Life. He likewi&s;e took our Sickne&s;&s;es, and bore our Infirmities in his own Body, but at the &s;ame time gave his cho&s;en Followers a con|vincing demon&s;tration of Omnipotence in his wonderful Trans|figuration upon the Mount, where his Face did &s;hine as the Sun, and his Raiment became white as the Light; this &s;hew'd him able to perform what he &s;aid to the Jews, <HI>De&s;troy this Temple and in three Days I will rai&s;e it up</HI>; Signifying thereby his Re&s;urrection, which declared him to be the Son of God with Power, and was a mighty Argument of his Divinity, and the
<PB N="4" REF="001544_0005_0FB3A8E32C640B50">
Truth of his Religion. Such was the blindne&s;s of the People of I&s;rael, that they e&s;teem'd him, Stricken, Smitten of God &amp; Afflict|ed; Whereas his Death &s;erv'd to make his Victory and Triumph the more Illu&s;trious, when he broke the Pri&s;on of the Grave and a&s;cended up on High, and led Captivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto Men. The Angels received Him with Acclamations of Joy, and Sung; <HI>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye Lift up, ye Ever|la&s;ting Doors; and the King of Glory &s;hall come in.</HI> Thus God Ex|alted Chri&s;t far above all Principality and Power, and Might and Dominion, and every Name that is Named, not only in this World, but al&s;o that which is to come; and hath put all things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church. He is the living Stone, di&s;allowed indeed of Men, but cho&s;en of God and precious; He is that Rock from whom the waters of Life flow; He is the Bright and Morning Star which chas'd away the Clouds of the Night, and brought in an Eternal Day; He is that Light which Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, that Directs them here, and Guide's them into the happy Seats of End|le&s;s Glory hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t is that Great Prophet who taught the way of God Perfectly. He renewed in Man the Image of God, by tho&s;e mo&s;t excellent Rules and Precepts, which he gave for the Practice of true Holine&s;s &amp; Vertue. The Gentiles had by their great Wick|edne&s;s almo&s;t quite Eras'd tho&s;e natural impre&s;&s;ions of Good and Evil which were written in their Hearts; and the Jews by their corrupt glo&s;&s;es had mi&s;erably defac'd the Moral Law which was en|graven in Tables of Stone. Our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour gave Strength and Beauty to them both, he Poli&s;h'd and Brighten'd the Principles of Rea&s;on, re&s;cu'd the Law from the fal&s;e interpretations of the Phari|&s;ees, and pre&s;s'd upon the Con&s;ciences of the People the mo&s;t diffi|cult Duties of the Divine Life; for the better Ob&s;ervance of which, he makes a clear Revelation of Eternal Rewards and Puni&s;hments, and acquaints them that if their Righteou&s;ne&s;s did not exceed the
<PB N="5" REF="001544_0006_0FB3A8E4B2AB2548">
Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, they &s;hould in no wi&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but &s;hould be ca&s;t into outer dark|ne&s;s, where there is Weeping and Gna&s;hing of Teeth. Thus He framed the Noble&s;t In&s;titution and Religion that was ever vouch|&s;af'd to Mankind; but this was not enough, for our fir&s;t Parents and all their Po&s;terity being deeply fallen from their Primitive Perfection, 'twas expedient there &s;hould be Satisfaction made for the Original and Actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which the Sons of Men are guilty of: Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone could make a full and &s;ufficient Oblation and Satisfaction for the Sins of the World; becau&s;e in his Humanity he was of the &s;ame Nature with the Offenders, but without Sin; and his Divinity added an Infinite Value to his Sa|crifice, tho' it was not capable of Suffering. And now having obtain'd an Unchangeable Prie&s;t-hood, and having over-come Death by his Death, He continues his Care and Protection to his Church, which he bought with a price ine&s;timable. He nouri&s;hes the Souls of his Di&s;ciples with the Spiritual Food of his Word and Sacraments, pour's upon them plentiful Effu&s;ions of his holy Spirit, and Promis'd to be with them to the End of the World. And in the la&s;t and greate&s;t act of his Regal Office, He &s;hall come again with Glory to Judge both Quick and Dead; and &s;hall Pronounce the Sentence of Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment to the Bad, and Life Eternal to the Good and Pious.</P>
<P>Thus I have con&s;ider'd the Dignity and Excellency of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which was the fir&s;t thing I propos'd to Speak to. I come,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To &s;hew how we are to Receive Him. Now to <HI>Re|ceive</HI> Chri&s;t, is to <HI>Believe</HI> on his Name; That is, To Exerci&s;e all the acts of &s;uch a Faith as produceth the genuine fruits of Piety and Obedience. If we &s;o acknowledge Chri&s;t as to believe in him, if we &s;o believe in him as to Love him; if we &s;o love him as to keep his Commandments; then we are rooted and grounded in love, and Chri&s;t dwells in our Hearts by Faith. This kind of
<PB N="6" REF="001544_0007_0FB3A8E62FA981F0">
Faith is that Key which opens the heavenly Trea&s;ures; that Spi|ritual Eye which di&s;cern's the Invi&s;ible things of God; that Hand which reaches to the Tree of Life; and that Pillar of Fire which leads the true I&s;raelites through the Wilderne&s;s of this World, into the Coele&s;tial Canaan. For &s;o it is Written; Joh&punc; iii 16. <HI>God &s;o loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;o|ever believeth in Him &s;hould not Peri&s;h, but have Everla&s;ting Life.</HI> The Purifying of the Heart is one great property of Faith, and is the Wedding Garment put on by tho&s;e who truly believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Otherwi&s;e, if our Hearts be Un&s;anctifyed and full of Sinful Thoughts, we &s;hall give our Saviour a wor&s;e entertain|ment than he receiv'd in the Manger, among the brute Bea&s;ts: But the Holy Spirit Purifies the Heart by Faith: as it is Written, <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 9. How acceptable to God Purity and Innocence is, there cannot be a greater in&s;tance than our Dear Lord's Concep|tion: She who was &s;o much in favour with God, as to bring a Saviour into the World, was indeed de&s;cended from the Royal Line of the Kings of Judah, according to Ancient Prophecies, but at this time the Stem of Je&s;&s;e was brought very low, being re|duc'd to its roots; and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin's Vertue was more Illu&s;trious than her Family. And as God &s;hew'd his great Love of Holine&s;s in the Conception of his beloved Son, &s;o he likewi&s;e did at his Nativity. The humble Shepherds were the Per&s;ons to whom the glad Tidings of great Joy were brought, and they heard the Angels Sing their Anthems of Prai&s;e, for the Birth of a Sa|viour. The heavenly Ho&s;t vi&s;ited them who&s;e harmle&s;s Lives bore the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to their own: and who in their mean Calling retain'd &s;ome Foot&s;teps of Man's Primitive Righteou&s;ne&s;s. The Inhabitants of Courts and Cities were not di&s;pos'd to welcome a Lawgiver, who &s;hould reform the Extortion and Inju&s;tice of the one; and the Pride and Luxury of the other: Earthly Trea&s;ures were all their care, and they gave them&s;elves little trouble about the Heavenly; and accordingly Chri&s;t tell's
<PB N="7" REF="001544_0008_0FB3A8E7AED113B0">
them, It was ea&s;ier for a Camel to go thro' a needles eye than for &s;uch to enter into his Kingdom. The Prince of Life will meet with no better a reception from us whil&s;t our affections lie groveling upon the Ground, and our minds cleave to the Du&s;t; but if we de&s;ire nothing upon Earth in compari&s;on of him, and count all Temporal things as dro&s;s, when they come in competition with our Duty; and Purify our &s;elves from all filthine&s;s of Fle&s;h and Spirit; then we &s;hall be qualified to entertain this Divine Gue&s;t in our Souls; our Bodies too will become living Temples of the Deity, and delightful Habi|tations of his Pre&s;ence. But this is not the only property of Faith; for it enlightens our Under&s;tandings as well as Sanctifies our Hearts; and this illumination of the Mind, makes us cor|dially imbrace the Religion of the Crucified Je&s;us. For want of it the Jews &s;tumbled and fell; they were an extremely carnal People, and look'd for happine&s;s no farther than the plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e: At the time of our Saviour's appearing among&s;t them, they retain'd their Polity &amp; Government, but their Necks were gall'd with the Roman Yoke, and they were Tributaries to that People; which made them impatiently long for the Me&s;&s;ias, whom they expected to be a Temporal Deliverer, that &s;hould rai&s;e Him&s;elf a Kingdom upon the ruins of the Roman Empire, and other Worldly Powers. Je&s;us Chri&s;t di&s;appointing them in their Ex|pectations; they were very far from owning Him to be the King of I&s;rael. And as his Humiliation here below were a &s;tumbling block to the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had &s;ome Knowledge of the true God, &s;o was it fooli&s;hne&s;s to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who&s;e Minds the god of this World had wholly darken'd. There is nothing more evident to an Unprejudic'd inquirer, than that the Prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament concerning the Me&s;&s;ias are made up of two &s;orts of Predictions; One foretelling his fir&s;t advent to Save the World, the other his &s;econd coming to Judge the World. With re&s;pect to the former, the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> de&s;cribes Him, in the liii <HI>d.</HI> Chapter, <HI>As a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief, without
<PB N="8" REF="001544_0009_0FB3A8EC268F9CD0">
Beauty that we &s;hould de&s;ire him.</HI> With re&s;pect to the latter, <HI>Daniel</HI> u&s;es the&s;e Magnificent expre&s;&s;ions, in the vii. Chapter 13, 14.v. <HI>I &s;aw in the night Vi&s;ions, and behold One like the Son of Man, came with the Clouds of Heaven, and came to the Antient of Days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People Nations and Languages &s;hould Serve him: His Dominion is an everla&s;ting Do|minion, which &s;hall not pa&s;s away, and his Kingdom that which &s;hall not be de&s;troy'd.</HI> So gro&s;s were the Under&s;tandings of the Jews, that the generality of them took no notice of this di&s;tinction, but refus'd the Holy One, and the Ju&s;t. In like manner the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t was fooli&s;hne&s;s to the <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> becau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an excellent Per&s;ons Sufferings was a thing beyond their comprehen&s;ion; being unacquainted with the true origine of Mankind, they knew nothing of that Sacrifice of A|tonement which was to reconcile them to God. Our Saviour's Sublime Precepts and Stupendous Miracles would certainly have given Him in their e&s;teem a preference to the greate&s;t of their Philo&s;ophers were they &s;atisfyed in the rea&s;ons of his Pa&s;&s;ion; they would &s;oon have de&s;i&s;ted from their cruel Per&s;ecutions, if they had been firmly per&s;waded that the fulne&s;s of the Godhead dwelt in Him, who was numbred among the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Such of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> who con&s;ulted and believed the Scriptures made no Scruple of giving their a&s;&s;ent to this Truth: The admirable Harmony betwixt the Old and New Te&s;tament, and the Re&s;ur|rection of Je&s;us from the Dead, convinc'd them of his Divi|nity, and took away the Scandal of his Cro&s;s. Upon this ac|count St. <HI>Paul</HI> congratulates the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> in the following Words, <HI>Wherefore I al&s;o, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Je&s;us, and Love unto all the Saints, cea&s;e not to give thinks for you, making mention of you in my Prayers; that the God of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wi&s;dom and Revelation in the Knowledge of him: the eyes of your

Under&s;tanding being inlightn'd:</HI>&mdash; Eph. i.15, 16, 17.v. From hence it appears that Illumination of the Mind is the happy con&s;e|quence of a Lively Faith; and if it be joyn'd with true Holi|ne&s;s, it will enable us worthily to Receive our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I proceed therefore to &s;hew,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The great advantages of doing &s;o; for thereby we become the Sons of God. Nothing can give us &s;o adequate an Idea of the greatne&s;s of this Priviledge, as the contemplation of the Mi&s;ery of our Natural E&s;tate. How are we born to po&s;&s;e&s;s a few Months of Vanity here below&punc; How &s;hort is our Life! Short indeed in Time, but tedious in the Troubles that attend it! Our Rea&s;on does di&s;tingui&s;h us from the re&s;t of the Creation in nothing more than in the pain it gives us; the brute Creatures are &s;en|&s;ible only of the pre&s;ent Moment; but we double our Mi&s;eries by anticipating the future, and reflecting upon the pa&s;t: The Na|tural Evils we &s;uffer are many and real, and the happine&s;s we enjoy is but imaginary, or at the be&s;t, but a privation of Pain. So in Moral things, how weak and faint is the light of una&s;&s;i&s;ted Rea&s;on, how uncertain to direct our &s;teps in the way that we &s;hould walk, how unable to lead us to that Re&s;t and Happine&s;s which we &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ire. The be&s;t Men among the Heathens allow'd them|&s;elves in great Vices, and the mo&s;t perfect of their Governments incourag'd &s;everal Enormities, by the very Laws of their Con&s;ti|tution; which is particularly true of the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>: Tho' a <HI>Plutarch</HI> inform's us, The <HI>Spartan</HI> Virtue out-&s;hin'd all the re&s;t. It is ea&s;y to account for this univer&s;al Corruption of the Gentile World, by ob&s;erving how much at a lo&s;s they were to Know what &s;hould be the reward of their actions; the vulgar &s;ort were amus'd with a Poetical Fiction of <HI>Flowry</HI> Plains, and <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> Fields; but their mo&s;t Exalted Sages confe&s;s'd it doubtful, Whe|ther there was any &s;uch thing as a Future State, or not. So true is the character which St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives of them, <HI>That they were
<PB N="10" REF="001544_0011_0FB3A8EE90EF3480">
aliens from the common Wealth of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers from the Covenant, having no hope, and being without God in the World: They were the Children of Wrath, and of Di&s;obedience, being dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> indeed were in a much better condition; and I&s;rael was honour'd with the title of God's Son, even his fir&s;t born: As it is Written, <HI>Exod</HI> iv.22.v. He was their God, and they were his People. But not to in&s;i&s;t upon the great Defects of their Law in many other points, I &s;hall only mention at pre&s;ent this difference betwixt them and us. Tho' they were the Sons of God, and the Peculiar favourites of Heaven, yet they had no other expre&s;s Motive to Obedience than the Promi&s;e of an Earthly Inheritance: therefore it is that the in&s;pired Penmen &s;o often lament the vanity of Human Life, wherein their comforts ended almo&s;t as &s;oon as begun. That good Prince <HI>Hezekiah</HI> de&s;cribes this condition of Mortality in the mo&s;t moving &s;train. <HI>The Grave cannot Prai&s;e thee, Death can|not Celebrate thee: They that go down into the Pit cannot hope for thy truth; the Living, the Living he &s;hall Prai&s;e thee, as I do this day</HI>: I&s;ai. xxxviii.18, 19.v. But now the Go&s;pel has open'd a new Scene of things, and di&s;cover'd &s;uch My&s;teries as have been hid from the Foundation of the World&middot; He that believeth in Chri&s;t tho' he were dead, yet &s;hall he live: And who&s;oever liveth and believeth in Him &s;hall never dye. The Adopted Sons of God under this gracious Di&s;pen&s;ation, are Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, and when they arrive at that happy Place, they &s;hall Inherit there Immortal Glory and Eternal Joy. We mu&s;t com|plain no more of the calamities of this World, &s;ince they &s;erve to quicken our Pace to a better; and Death it &s;elf lo&s;es its Terrors, as being but a &s;hort Pa&s;&s;age to an Endle&s;s Life. And that we may not mi&s;s of the prize of the High Calling that is before us, God a&s;&s;i&s;t's us with the aids of his Holy Spirit, by who&s;e In&s;piration the Thoughts of our Hearts are cleans'd, our Lu&s;ts &s;ubdu'd, and all the hindrances of our Salvation removed:
<PB N="11" REF="001544_0012_0FB3A8F01E6AE168">
Such is God's Paternal Love and Care of us in and thro' Chri&s;t, That he has not given us the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry <HI>Abba Father,</HI> Rom. viii.14. Another in&s;tance of the Divine Goodne&s;s which we en|joy in this State of Adoption, is the Plenary Remi&s;&s;ion of our Sins. The blood of Chri&s;t &s;peaketh better things than that of <HI>Abel,</HI> and taketh away the Sins of the World. They who &s;in|cerely repent and believe the Go&s;pel, &s;hall be Saved from Eter|nal Death; God will be Merciful to their Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and their Iniquities will he remember no more. The con&s;ideration of the&s;e inexpre&s;&s;ible benefits one would think &s;ufficient to make us perform the conditions upon which they are Promi&s;ed, <HI>Namely,</HI> To Believe in Chri&s;t, by whom alone we are Ju&s;tified and Re|concil'd to God. But le&s;t there &s;hould be in any of you an Evil Heart of Unbelief,</P>
<P>I come in the <HI>Fourth</HI> Place, To repre&s;ent the great Sinfulne&s;s of not Receiving Je&s;us Chri&s;t as our Saviour. If our Duty ri&s;es in proportion to the Means of Conviction, which are afforded us, then our guilt will be very great &s;hould we deny our a&s;&s;ent to the Truth of the Go&s;pel: for Almighty God in his Infinite Wi&s;dom has u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible methods to Excite our Faith, and Engage our Obedience to Je&s;us Chri&s;t: which will appear, if we do but con&s;ider fir&s;t, The Intrin&s;ick Excellency of the Chri&s;ti|an Religion, which evidently bears the &s;tamp of Divinity upon it, as being agreeable to the highe&s;t rea&s;on, and advancing Hu|man Nature to the greate&s;t Perfection it is capable of in this World; It acquaints us with the great End of our Creation, E&s;tabli&s;hes a ju&s;t empire over our Pa&s;&s;ions, and In&s;tructs in the way of obtaining true Happine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> The Beatifick Vi&s;ion and Fruition of God: Nay, &s;o compleat are the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, That they do not only make our Lives more Divine and Rational, but likewi&s;e free them from a great part of the Mi&s;e|ries of this World: Were they duly ob&s;erved, the Peace of God

would attend us thro' all the changes and chances of this Mortal Life, and &s;afely conduct us to the Haven of Re&s;t and Felicity: The Wi&s;dom from Above which is fir&s;t Pure, and then&punc; Peacea|ble, would re&s;tore this pre&s;ent State to it's Original Innocence and Tranquillity, and make Wars and Tumults which di&s;turb the&s;e Lower Regions to cea&s;e in the Earth. In &s;hort, The Chri&s;tian Religion does &s;o infinitely exceed all others, that if there were no other argument, this alone is a &s;ufficient proof, that our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was a Per&s;on &s;ent from God. But alas, This is the condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men love darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil; and therefore extraordinary Miracles were u&s;ed to fix their belief and attention: The <HI>Jews</HI> were extremely Sotti&s;h in a&s;cribing them to the Devil, becau&s;e as our Saviour argu'd, they tended to the De&s;truction of Satan's Kingdom; they were mo&s;t of them acts of Charity and Mercy towards Men, and were brought in confirmation of that holy In&s;tituti|on which Je&s;us Chri&s;t Publi&s;h'd to the World; whereby the Powers of Darkne&s;s were utterly &s;ubverted, and Mankind was re&s;cued from their Mi&s;erable Slavery, and Subjection to Evil Spi|rits: the Finger of God therefore was plainly vi&s;ible in tho&s;e Mighty Works, and they were effects of a Divine Power Inhe|rent in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. However, be&s;ides this evidence of Mira|cles God has given us the &s;ure word of Prophecy to depend upon, that there might not be the lea&s;t pretence for Infidelity; how were the Time and Place of his Birth, the mo&s;t impor|tant actions of his Life, his bitter Death and Pa&s;&s;ion, and his Victory over Hell and the Grave exactly foretold many Ages before our Saviour's Incarnation; to Him bear all the Prophets Witne&s;s; Nay <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s &s;tile is &s;o clear and particular, that it is difficult to relate the Hi&s;tory of pa&s;t Tran&s;actions more di&s;tinctly than he has Propheci'd of things to come. How ju&s;t then is that Sentence which Chri&s;t pronounces upon the Unbelieving
<PB N="13" REF="001544_0014_0FB3A8F32105CFC8">
World, after his appearance among them? <HI>He that believeth not, is condemned already, becau&s;e he has not believed in the Name of the Only begotten Son of God.</HI> This is a very fruitful Topick, but I hope there is no need to inlarge upon it, and con&s;idering the Severity of the Sea&s;on, will conclude with a brief APPLI|CATION of what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, Let us not neglect this Great Salvation; but let us &s;incerely believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and act &s;uitably to &s;uch a belief. Our Duty is &s;et before us in the cleare&s;t Light, and we have more Powerful Motives to Obedience than either <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles</HI> had; our Obligations therefore are greater, and more will be expected from us; and tho' we are Ju&s;tified by Faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, yet we know, <HI>That without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> Thus are we to receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t here, if we expect to be receiv'd by Him here-after; for He &s;olemnly declares, <HI>Not every one that &s;aith unto Me, Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that does the Will of my Father which is in Heaven</HI>; And, <HI>Ye are my Friends if ye do what&s;oever I command you.</HI> S. Matth. vii.11.v. S. Joh. xv.14.v.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Let us &s;et a ju&s;t value upon the glorious Privilege of being made the Sons of God. As we are Heirs of Eternity, and entituled to a Kingdom that &s;hall not decay, let us never do any thing unworthy of &s;uch Hopes, and unbecoming &s;uch a Relation; but let us walk as Children of the Light, and of the Day: and &s;ince Je&s;us Chri&s;t has Sanctify'd our Nature in taking it upon Him, let us not Deba&s;e it with tho&s;e Vices which were inexcu&s;able even in the Heathens.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Let us be careful to render our ju&s;t Tribute of Prai&s;e and Thanksgiving for the ineffable Mercy of
<PB N="14" REF="001544_0015_0FB3A8F481B5ED60">
God, in &s;ending His Own Son into the World. Our Saviour is come, and the Glory of the Lord is ri&s;en upon us, which giveth Light to them that &s;it in darkne&s;s, and guideth our Feet into the way of Peace. Let us therefore extol the Name of God, and &s;ay; <HI>Allelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent Reigneth.</HI> Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour unto Him. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing, Honour, Glory and Power be unto Him that &s;itteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for Ever and Ever.</HI></P>
