<P>I AM not ignorant that the &s;tyle of dedications in general, is that of panegyric, where the au|thor endeavours to elevate the

Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary for me, to &s;et forth, the many amiable traits, in a cha|racter &s;o well known, &s;o univer|&s;ally e&s;teemed and re&s;pected as Mrs. Bingham's.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS a per&s;on of &s;en&s;ibility, whom bu|&s;ine&s;s or nece&s;&s;ity, forces into the hou&s;e of an entire &s;tranger, (e&s;pecially if that &s;tranger is his &s;uperior in genius, education or rank,) experiences a &s;en&s;a|tion unde&s;cribably painful, in being ne|ce&s;&s;iated to announce him&s;elf, and ex|plain the intent of his vi&s;it: &s;o I feel my&s;elf inexpre&s;&s;ibly embarra&s;&s;ed and timid, whil&s;t performing the unavoid|able ta&s;k of writing a Preface. It is ad|dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to, and calling up the attention of a multiplicity of &s;trangers; it is introducing not my&s;elf indeed, but what is nearly the &s;ame thing, the off|&s;pring of my imagination, to their no|tice, and con&s;cious as I am, that it will
<PB N="xii" REF="029439_0012_0FE29F106EBAF788">
be peru&s;ed by tho&s;e, who are infinitely my &s;uperiors, this awkward timidity encrea&s;es, to an almo&s;t unconquerable degree.</P>
<P>"The works of fiction," &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, <Q>with which the pre&s;ent ge|neration &s;eems more particularly de|lighted; are &s;uch as exhibit life in its true &s;tate, diver&s;ified only by ac|cidents that daily happen in the world, and influenced by pa&s;&s;ions and qualities, which are really to be found in conver&s;ing with mankind. In narratives, where hi&s;torical vera|city has no place, I cannot di&s;cover why there &s;hould not be exhibited a mo&s;t perfect idea of virtue, not an|gelical, nor above probability; for what we cannot credit, we &s;hall ne|ver imitate; but the highe&s;t and pur|e&s;t that humanity can reach, which exerci&s;ed in &s;uch trials as the various revolutions of things &s;hall bring up|on it, may, by conquering &s;ome ca|lamities, and enduring others, teach us what we may hope, and what we can perform.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="029439_0013_0FE29FEAC851E5E8">
Upon this plan I have endeavoured to form the "Trials of the Human Heart." My Heroine, though not wholly free from error, (for where &s;hall we find the human being that is &s;o?) I tru&s;t is not altogether unworthy imitation. Through various trying &s;ituations, as daughter, wife, and mo|ther; I have &s;trove to conduct her with propriety, tempering the weakne&s;s of humanity with the patience and forti|tude of a Chri&s;tian, and that dignified pride, which will ever ari&s;e from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the moral virtues.</P>
<P>It is with reluctance I find my&s;elf obliged to remark, that the literary world is infe&s;ted with a kind of loath|&s;ome reptile, of the cla&s;s of non-de&s;cripts, for it cannot be ranked with proprie|ty among&s;t either authors or critics, not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to form either, and being in it&s;elf re|markable for nothing but its noxious qualities: its only aim is to prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of any work of genius; and &s;welling with envy, &s;hould the &s;malle&s;t part of public favour, be conferred on
<PB N="xiv" REF="029439_0014_0FE29FF03383D208">
another, &s;pits out its malignant poi&s;on, in &s;currility and detraction. One of the&s;e noi&s;ome reptiles, has lately crawl|ed over the volumes, which I have had the temerity to &s;ubmit to the public eye. I &s;ay <HI>crawled over</HI> them, becau&s;e I am certain it has never penetrated beyond the title-page of any.</P>
<P>Perhaps it would be as well, did I &s;uffer this circum&s;tance to pa&s;s unno|ticed; the arguments u&s;ed, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, are unan&s;werable, being in &s;ome parts incomprehen&s;ible, and in others of &s;uch a nature, that no woman can glance her eye over them, without feel|ing the blu&s;h of offended delicacy crim|&s;on her cheek. Yet, as I have been accu&s;ed of writing in an improper &s;tyle in my Novel of the "Fille de Chambre," and of expre&s;&s;ing &s;entiments foreign to my heart, in my Comedy of "Slaves in Algiers," I think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ure the candid and impartial public, that both the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are equally fal&s;e and &s;candalous.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="029439_0015_0FE29FF565396370">
Though many a lei&s;ure hour has been amu&s;ed, and many a &s;orrowful one be|guiled, whil&s;t giving Fancy the reins, I have applied my&s;elf to my pen, it has ever been my pride, that I never yet wrote a line that might tend to mi&s;lead the untutored judgment, or corrupt the inexperienced heart; and heaven for|bid I &s;hould &s;uffer ought to e&s;cape my pen, that might call a blu&s;h to the cheek of innocence, or de&s;erve a glance of di&s;plea&s;ure from the eye of the mo&s;t rigid morali&s;t.</P>
<P>As to my opinion of the political concerns of America, or my wi&s;hes in regard to her welfare, I cannot better explain them, than by giving a &s;light &s;ketch of my private hi&s;tory, with which, I rather imagine, the <HI>creature</HI> alluded to, is entirely unacquainted.</P>
<P>It was my fate, at a period when memory can &s;carcely retain the &s;mall|e&s;t trace of the occurrence, to accompa|ny my father, (Mr. William Ha&s;well, who is a lieutenant in the Briti&s;h navy) to Bo&s;ton in New England, where he
<PB N="xvi" REF="029439_0016_0FE29FF70E469E08">
had married a &s;econd wife, my mother having lo&s;t her life in giving me exi&s;t|ence. Ble&s;t with a genteel competen|cy, and placed by his rank and educa|tion in that &s;phere of life, where the polite and friendly attentions of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters courted our acceptance, and enjoying a con&s;tant intercour&s;e with the families of the of|ficers of the Briti&s;h army and navy, then &s;tationary there, eight years of my life glided almo&s;t imperceptibly away.</P>
<P>At that time the di&s;&s;entions between England and America encrea&s;ed to an alarming degree: my father bore the king's commi&s;&s;ion, he had taken the oath of allegiance; certain I am that no one who con&s;iders the nature of an oath, voluntarily taken, no one who re|flects, that previous to this period, he had &s;erved thirty years under the Bri|ti&s;h government, will blame him for a &s;trict adherence to principles which were interwoven as it were with his ex|i&s;tance. He did adhere to them, the attendant con&s;equence may readily
<PB N="xvii" REF="029439_0017_0FE29FF88FC41260">
be &s;uppo&s;ed; his per&s;on was confined, his property confi&s;cated.</P>
<P>Then it was that the benevolence and philanthropy, which &s;o eminently di&s;|tingui&s;h the &s;ons and daughters of Co|lumbia made an indeliable impre&s;&s;ion on my heart, an impre&s;&s;ion which nei|ther time or chance can obliterate, for while their political principles obliged them to afflict, the humanity, the Chri&s;|tian like benevolence of their &s;ouls, in|cited them to wipe the tears of &s;or|row from the eyes of my parents, to mitigate their &s;ufferings, and render tho&s;e afflictions in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;up|portable. Would to Heaven it was in my power to render their memories as immortal, as my gratitude is unbound|ed.</P>
<P>Having been detained as a pri&s;oner two years and an half, part of which was &s;pent in <HI>Hingham,</HI> and part in <HI>Ab|ington;</HI> an exchange of pri&s;oners tak|ing place between the Briti&s;h and Ame|ricans, my father and his family were &s;ent by cartel to Halifax, from whence
<PB N="xviii" REF="029439_0018_0FE2A00085D996D0">
we embarked for England. I will not pretend to de&s;cribe the &s;orrow I experi|enced, in being thus &s;eparated from the companions of my early years: every wi&s;h of my heart was for the welfare and pro&s;perity of a country, which con|tained &s;uch dear, &s;uch valuable friends, and the only comfort of which my mind was capable, was indulging in the delightful hope, of being at &s;ome future period permitted again to revi&s;it a land &s;o beloved, companions &s;o regretted.</P>
<P>Too young at that time, to have form|ed any political principles of my own, I may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to have adopted tho&s;e of my father, but the truth is, that equally attached to either country, the unhappy di&s;&s;entions af|fected me in the &s;ame manner as a per&s;on may be imagined to feel, who having a tender lover, and an affection|ate brother who are equally dear to her heart, and by whom &s;he is equally be|loved, &s;ees them engaged in a quarrel with, and fighting again&s;t each other, when, let which&s;oever party conquer,
<PB N="xix" REF="029439_0019_0FE2A00219568AB0">
&s;he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;en&s;ible to the fate of the vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>During a period of twelve years a variety of painful circum&s;tances unne|ce&s;&s;ary here to recount, contributed to deprive me of a decent independence inherited from my paternal grandfather, and at length to bring me back to America, in a very different &s;ituation, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, from that in which I left it; but with a heart, &s;till glowing with the &s;ame affectionate &s;en&s;ations, and exulting in its evident improve|ment: the arts are encouraged, manu|factures increa&s;e, and this happy land bids fair to be in the cour&s;e of a few years the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing nation in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Is it then wonderful, that accu&s;tomed from the days of childhood, to think of America and its inhabitants with af|fection, linked to them by many near connections, and &s;incerely attached to them, from principles of gratitude, that I &s;hould offer the mo&s;t ardent prayers for a continuation of their pro&s;perity,
<PB N="xx" REF="029439_0020_0FE2A003A4640E28">
or that feeling the benign influence of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and liberty, here &s;o eminently enjoyed, I &s;hould wi&s;h that influence extended throughout eve|ry nation under heaven.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave to &s;ay a few words more, concerning my pre|&s;ent publication. I am willing to flat|ter my&s;elf, that in offering this novel to the public, I am not preparing for my future life, either &s;hame or repentance. That it is throughout the whole, hap|pily imagined or highly poli&s;hed, I have not &s;ufficient confidence in my own abili|ties to warrant; but whatever may be my final &s;entence from the world in general, I have at lea&s;t endeavoured to de&s;erve their kindne&s;s, nor &s;hall I envy the ho|nours which wit and learning obtain in any other cau&s;e, if I may be &s;o happy as to awaken in the bo&s;oms of my youth|ful readers, a thorough dete&s;tation of vice, and a &s;pririted emulation, to em|brace and follow the precepts of Piety, Truth and Virtue.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Woodbine Cot,</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI> 20<HI>th,</HI> 1775.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WILL you believe me, Celia, when I tell you, I wi&s;h I was at Bologne again; that I am di&s;&s;atisfied and unhappy. You are &s;urpri&s;ed. It is neverthele&s;s certain|ly true. We formed erroneous opinions of the world; we thought it a paradi&s;e compar|ed to the &s;olemnity and gloom of our con|vent. Tru&s;t me, my dear, I have as yet found nothing, in this gay, bu&s;y world, half &s;o
<PB N="2" REF="029439_0022_0FE2A00D88152338">
plea&s;ing, as that &s;weet retirement. But I forget that this is my fir&s;t letter, and that you naturally wi&s;h to know every incident which has happened &s;ince our &s;eparation. This innocent curio&s;ity &s;hall be gratified, and to begin:</P>
<P>During our journey, Mr. Verdome inform|ed me that the rea&s;on of my being &s;ent for home &s;o &s;uddenly, was to attend Mrs. Mir|van, my godmother, who had been for a long time ill, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a deep decline. "She went to Bri&s;tol," con|tinued he, "a few days before I left England; your mother accompanied her, your father and Mrs. Talbot were to follow the en&s;uing week; we &s;hall, therefore, on our arrival in England, &s;et forward immediately for that place.</P>
<P>"Who is Mrs. Talbot?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"She is," replied Mr. Verdome, "a wi|dow lady, who, being left in rather indigent circum&s;tances, and being a di&s;tant relation of the family, has accepted an a&s;ylum in your father's hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"If &s;he is an amiable woman," &s;aid I, "my mother mu&s;t be happy in having &s;uch a com|panion."</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="029439_0023_0FE2A00F236B8528">
"She is &s;en&s;ible, well bred, and good an|tured," he replied&mdash;and here the conver&s;a|tion dropped.</P>
<P>I was, as you may ea&s;ily imagine, too much taken up with the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;a|tion of &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, to be able to reflect much, while cro&s;&s;ing the channel: but no &s;ooner was I in the chai&s;e, proceeding toward Bri&s;|tol, than I began to form a thou&s;and differ|ent ideas about meeting my parents, not hav|ing &s;een either of them &s;ince I could remem|ber. I pictured them to my&s;elf, as very amiable old people&mdash;and, in fancy, felt their embraces and ki&s;&s;ed off the tears of joy I &s;aw falling from their eyes. Celia, we children of &s;implicity form &s;trange enthu&s;ia&s;tic no|tions. In thinking of my dear Mrs. Mir|van, I felt more lively &s;en&s;ations; becau&s;e I was certain if &s;he lived, when I arrived, I &s;hould be received by her with heart-felt &s;a|tisfaction, and &s;hould I find her no more, my own heart would experience the mo&s;t acute angui&s;h. You mu&s;t remember how much I am indebted to her tenderne&s;s and affection, and how very happy I was whenever &s;he vi|&s;ited our convent.</P>
<P>At length we arrived at the end of our journey. I trembled &s;o, that I could &s;carce|ly &s;upport my&s;elf. Expectation, hope, fear,

by turns were predominant in my bo&s;om. When we &s;topped, a hand&s;ome man, in ap|pearance about five and thirty or forty years of age, handed me from the chai&s;e, and &s;a|luting me, &s;aid to Mr. Verdome, "faith &s;he is a very fine girl." I &s;aw Mr. Verdome frown; but had not time to make any fur|ther remarks, before I found my&s;elf in the chamber of my godmother. Oh Celia! how that dear woman was altered; her face pale, eyes &s;unk and &s;o reduced that &s;he could not ri&s;e to meet me. She faintly &s;miled when I entered the room, I could not &s;peak. I &s;aw nothing, thought of nothing, but her; and running to her threw my arms round her neck and bur&s;t into tears. "Dear creature," &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan (embracing me) "we have &s;urpri&s;ed her. She was not prepared to &s;ee me thus, but come, my love, dry your tears; here is another lady, who indeed &s;hould have been the fir&s;t object of your attention." I turned round and beheld the mo&s;t beautiful woman, you can conceive, bending over me, her eyes full of tears. "My child, my belov|ed Meriel," &s;aid &s;he, taking me in her arms; "have you no recollection of your mother?" Whil&s;t I was folded in her maternal embrace the door opened, and my mother continued, "come Mr. Howard welcome your daugh|ter." I rai&s;ed my head from my dear mo|ther's bo&s;om, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the
<PB N="5" REF="029439_0025_0FE2A0125EBB0508">
&s;ame gentleman, who had handed me from the chai&s;e. "Your father, Meriel," &s;aid my mother. I bent one knee to the ground and ki&s;&s;ed his hand. But &s;hall I confe&s;s that whil&s;t in that action, which &s;hould have ex|pre&s;&s;ed filial re&s;pect and love, I felt more of terror than either.</P>
<P>"Ri&s;e girl, ri&s;e," &s;aid he, "I have no ta&s;te for the&s;e fine romantic &s;cenes. You knelt, becau&s;e you were told it would be expected, not from any genuine impul&s;e of the heart." My poor mother looked di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. "I hope," &s;aid I, in a faultering voice, "I hope, &s;ir, my conduct will henceforth convince my dear parents, that I am wanting in neither duty nor affection." "We &s;hall &s;ee," &s;aid he, carele&s;sly. "You women in general talk well, but as to your obedience and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, when you are put to the trial you al|ways fall far &s;hort of your profe&s;&s;ions." I &s;aw the tears &s;tand in my mother's eyes. Oh! cried the unfeeling man, if you are for a whimpering party, I &s;hall leave you to your&s;elves, and go and fini&s;h my game at piquet with Mrs. Talbot.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I felt my&s;elf relieved, and entered into conver&s;ation with my mo|ther and Mrs. Mirvan: though I could not but ob&s;erve the hard &s;truggle my dear pa|rent

had to repre&s;s her tears; I dared not notice her di&s;tre&s;s, lea&s;t by &s;o doing, I &s;hould increa&s;e it: be&s;ides I judged, that however palpable my father's errors might be, it would be an ungrateful &s;ubject to her, e&s;pe|cially from the lips of a child.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t few days after my arrival, we flattered our&s;elves, that Mrs. Mirvan was much better; but this enchanting illu&s;ion &s;oon vani&s;hed. We had been one morning chatting on her evident amendment, and &s;he told me, when able to &s;upport the fatigue of a journey, &s;he would go to the &s;outh of France, and I &s;hould accompany her. She wi&s;hed my mother to go; but that dear good woman, &s;ays &s;he, can never leave your fa|ther for &s;o long a time, (and his fortune be|ing but &s;mall will not allow the whole fami|ly to take &s;uch a journey.) At dinner time, &s;he eat the wing of a chicken, and &s;eemed to eat with an appetite; after which &s;he drank a gla&s;s of Madeira; and in a &s;hort time com|plaining of drow&s;ine&s;s, laid down on the &s;o|pha: my mother retired to her own room, and I took up a volume of Pope's Homer, to amu&s;e my&s;elf. For &s;ome time, her &s;leep &s;eemed compo&s;ed, but &s;he &s;oon grew re&s;tle&s;s, breathed quick, and frequently &s;tarted, eve|ry now and then fetching a deep &s;igh, which terminated in a kind of convul&s;ive groan. I
<PB N="7" REF="029439_0027_0FE2A01BE6D6AC38">
was alarmed and rang the bell, but before any one an&s;wered it, I perceived my belov|ed godmother was in &s;trong convul&s;ions; my &s;hrieks brought the whole family to the room; a phy&s;ician was &s;ent for, but alas! nothing could be done. She was immedi|ately put to bed; but never recovered her &s;en&s;es until a few moments before the final &s;cene clo&s;ed. In that &s;hort interval, &s;he bec|koned my mother towards her, and putting my hand in hers, thus addre&s;&s;ed me, though with difficulty. "Meriel, you are the only comfort that dear &s;uffering &s;aint po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; let mutual friend&s;hip cement the bonds of natu|ral affection; my child never for&s;ake your mother, &s;o &s;hall the father of mercies never for&s;ake you." I cla&s;ped my arms round my weeping parent, and articulated a vow to heaven, never to let her know a grief or pain, it was in my power to remove. My fortune, my peace of mind, my reputation, my life, every thing but integrity of heart, &s;hould be &s;acrificed to in&s;ure her felicity. "Enough, my child," faintly cried Mrs. Mirvan, "the Creator of the univer&s;e has heard, and accepts your vow. Oh Meriel!" continued &s;he, after a pau&s;e, "let it be thro' life ever pre&s;ent to your memory, that you mu&s;t one day be as I am now, trembling on the verge of eternity. Love thy Maker above all things, and thy fellow creatures a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>"Oh!" &s;aid I, as I dropped on my knees by her bed &s;ide, "let me live a life of puri|ty, that my death may be like hers." Amen, amen, cried my mother, as &s;he rai&s;ed me from the ground. We retired to her apart|ment, where cla&s;ped in each others arms, we pour'd forth that tribute of affliction, the merits of our lo&s;t friend demanded.</P>

Mrs. Talbot conducted her&s;elf with great propriety, exerted her&s;elf to comfort and cheer my mother, tho' I cannot tell why that dear woman did not receive her atten|tions with that grateful &s;weetne&s;s, which &s;he ever manife&s;ted to others. I think Mrs. Talbot a mo&s;t engaging woman. She is not &s;o hand&s;ome as my mother, but has a great deal more vivacity. She is tall, well made, and has a very expre&s;&s;ive countenance, is affable, conciliating and extremely &s;en&s;ible; &s;he is &s;o kind as to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct my &s;tu|dies. You know I am very fond of natu|ral hi&s;tory. She frequently reads to me, and afterwards we &s;aunter thro' the gar|den, fields and meadows in &s;earch of &s;ub|jects to illu&s;trate what we have read. In the&s;e rambles my mother accompanies us, but it grieves me to &s;ee &s;uch a &s;ettled me|lancholy impre&s;&s;ed upon her countenance. My brother Richard ye&s;terday came from &s;chool for a few days. I can percieve he is my father's favourite, indeed my mother is extremely partial to him, tho' it is with pain. I remark many unamiable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> appear evi|dent in his di&s;po&s;ition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as yet he has &s;een but thirteen years, being three years younger than my&s;elf. His behaviour to me was very ungracious, when we were fir&s;t in|troduced to each other. Tho' I had never &s;een him, yet as children of the &s;ame parents
<PB N="10" REF="029439_0030_0FE2A0268CAB9F30">
I felt my heart drawn toward him by an ir|re&s;i&s;table impul&s;e. I therefore on hearing of his arrival, ran down &s;tairs and was going to welcome him with a cordial embrace, but the frigid coldne&s;s that his countenance di&s;|played repre&s;&s;ed my ardour. He advanced, ju&s;t touched my cheek and bowing profound|ly, wi&s;hed me joy of my fortune. "Joy,! brother &s;aid I, indeed I have not thought of any thing but regret, for the &s;ad occa&s;ion of my becoming mi&s;tre&s;s of this fortune; would to heaven! dear Mrs. Mirvan were &s;till alive to enjoy tho&s;e few thou&s;ands, the acqui&s;ition of which cannot compen&s;ate to me for the lo&s;s of her valuable &s;ociety." "She was to be &s;ure a good old woman," &s;aid he, carele&s;&s;|ly, "but you know &s;i&s;ter, &s;he was very infirm, &s;o I think &s;he is much happier out of the world than in it." "Come, come Richard," &s;aid my mother with a look, half &s;miling, half frowning, "I mu&s;t not hear you &s;peak lightly of an event, which has &s;o highly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed us all." Ma&s;ter Richard &s;miled con|temptuou&s;ly, turned on his heel, hummed a tune and walked out of the room. How happens it, Celia, that the child of a woman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an excellent heart, and &s;uch exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility &s;hould be &s;o very unfeeling; perhaps you will &s;ay he cannot re&s;emble both parents; true, too true, it is a ju&s;t remark; but oh how &s;uperlatively.

happy would be my lot if both tho&s;e parents re&s;embled each other.</P>
<P>We live very retired, my father's income will not &s;uffer him to a&s;&s;ociate with the high|er cla&s;s of inhabitants of the village, and his pride keeps him from tho&s;e in the middling or lower walks of life. We are, therefore, vi&s;ited by very few, nor among tho&s;e few have I &s;een one, with whom my heart would claim acquaintance. Surely, Celia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t be women in the world, and young women too, who are different from any I have &s;een here. There are two families whom my mother is permitted to vi&s;it, and there are daughters in each family: but whenever we meet, which indeed is but &s;eldom; they have &s;o much to tell me concerning their lovers, their dre&s;&s;es and their petty differ|ences with each other, that we have not a moment for rational conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>By this account you will naturally &s;up|po&s;e my time cannot pa&s;s in the mo&s;t agree|able manner.

I &s;hall continue to write to you my friend, tho' I can fore&s;ee my letters will contain but little variety: however it will be the means of keeping alive that friend&s;hip, which is to me &s;o valuable, and a time may come when I &s;hall be again happy in your &s;ociety.

<P>MERIEL is returned from the continent, where &s;he has been from a &s;tate of in|fancy immured in a gloomy convent. Mrs. Howard did not think her own family a pro|per place for the tuition of a girl. She was right: her hu&s;band is by no means a brilli|ant example, and I think, it would be a for|tunate circum&s;tance for young Howard was any thing to happen that might &s;eperate him from his father. Meriel is not what is ge|nerally termed a fine girl; &s;he is rather be|low the middle &s;ize, and inclined to <HI>on bon point;</HI> her face is not regularly pretty, but &s;he has a lovely pair of hazel eyes, through which you may read every emotion of her &s;oul. She is fair, a fine glow of health ani|mates her face, and a &s;mile of good humour plays about her mouth; a luxuriant quanti|ty of che&s;nut hair hangs in ringlets down

her neck and &s;hades a forehead that is orna|mented with the mo&s;t beautiful eye-brows I ever beheld. Yet &s;he is not &s;triking at fir&s;t &s;ight, indeed, you would rather be tempted to &s;ay &s;he was plain, but the moment &s;he &s;peaks you mu&s;t be charmed. I have heard women &s;ing who have fine voices; but I would ra|ther hear Meriel read a pathetic tale than li&s;ten to the fine&s;t &s;ingers in England. The melody of her voice, is &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oft that &s;he makes the meane&s;t &s;ubject intere&s;ting; her coun|tenance intelligent, her mind fraught with every gentle, generous virtue, but withall &s;he is the pure child of nature.

<P>CELIA, if you value your own happine&s;s never de&s;ire to quit the convent. When I was there, I imagined my father a worthy character. Had I never left it, I had never been undeceived: indeed, it is a &s;ad, &s;ad thing to reflect on, but this man, whom nature, religion, every &s;acred tie obliges me to re&s;pect and love: this very man is a libertine, and an infidel. He came

one Sunday morning into the library, where I was reading. "Well my pretty ro&s;e-bud," &s;aid he, for he generally calls me by &s;ome &s;uch unaccountable name; "What are your &s;tudies?" "Rowe's letters," I replied. "What do you read &s;uch &s;tuff as that for?" cried he, pulling the book out of my hand, "'Tis time enough for you to read &s;uch &s;e|rious non&s;en&s;e &s;ome forty or fifty years hence, and here is that &s;tupid fellow Harvey too," continued he, taking up a book that lay up|on the table. "Why child, the&s;e ridiculous books are enough to turn your head; they might have done well enough in a convent, but &s;urely you may find &s;omething more amu&s;ing in this collection." "I read the&s;e &s;erious authors by choice, &s;ir," &s;aid I. "You have a &s;trange ta&s;te for a girl of your age then," he replied, "but I don't believe you &s;peak as you think. Come tell me hone&s;tly, Meriel," continued he &s;itting, down be&s;ide me, "did you never get any novels or ro|mances in the convent?" You may &s;uppo&s;e I &s;tared at him, for you know we never &s;aw a book of the kind, during the whole time we were together; of this I a&s;&s;ured him: to which he replied; "then that ea&s;ily ac|counted for my ta&s;te." He then began to &s;peak of religion, and the &s;acred writings in a manner that made me tremble. At fir&s;t, I thought he meant only to try me; but
<PB N="17" REF="029439_0037_0FE2A03AF04ADAA0">
finding the more I oppo&s;ed his &s;entiments, the &s;tronger were the arguments he advanced to confute, as he &s;aid, "my fooli&s;h bigotry, to a &s;ubject which was not worthy the at|tention of any but old women and children." I ro&s;e from my &s;eat and bur&s;ting into tears, cried, "oh! &s;ir, if the&s;e are indeed your &s;en|timents they &s;hock me to the &s;oul." "Come girl, come don't cry," &s;aid he, pulling me toward him; "you mu&s;t try to get the better of the&s;e &s;uper&s;titious notions, and learn to think and act for your&s;elf, unbia&s;ed by the prejudices of others." I could not an&s;wer for my tears. He took me in his arms and ki&s;&s;ed me; but my &s;oul &s;hrunk back from his embrace. My mother ju&s;t then pa&s;&s;ing the window, he left me and went in|to the garden to join her. I do not like this Mrs. Talbot, &s;o well as I did at fir&s;t; I &s;aw my father take a liberty with her ye&s;ter|day when they thought they were unob&s;erv|ed. There was an impropriety in it, which made me &s;hudder; and a thought darted acro&s;s my mind which almo&s;t &s;tunned my faculties: &s;urely they cannot be &s;o very abandoned. Oh my poor mother!

<P>It is as I &s;u&s;pected, Mrs. Talbot is an un|worthy woman. This morning, I aro&s;e ear|lier than common, intending, the weather being &s;ine, to walk into the meadows, before breakfa&s;t, pa&s;&s;ing my mother's chamber door I &s;aw it was partly open; and, looking in, I percieved my dear mother rai&s;ed upon her elbow in the bed, the tears &s;treaming down her face, and &s;obbing, as tho' her heart would break. Unable to re&s;train my&s;elf, I ru&s;hed into the room and ardently reque&s;ted to know the cau&s;e of her grief. She ha&s;tily en|deavoured to dry her tears and compo&s;e her countenance, a&s;&s;ured me that nothing parti|cular was the matter, but that &s;he often was &s;eized with tho&s;e involuntary fits of weep|ing, for which &s;he could a&s;&s;ign no cau&s;e. "Oh! my dear mother," &s;aid I, "you cannot thus deceive a child, who loves you as I do. Long have I noticed the anxiety that weighs heavy at your heart, and preys upon your &s;pirits. Can you, do you think your daugh|ter unworthy to be tru&s;ted with your &s;orrows. Believe me I will trea&s;ure them in my bo|&s;om as a &s;acred depo&s;it, and having ea&s;ed your labouring brea&s;t of the painful burthen will pour into it the balm of con&s;olation."

make you unhappy, I cannot be more &s;o than I am already, &s;aid I, for how is it po&s;&s;ible I can be at peace when you are the victim of concealed angui&s;h? "Oh! my child, &s;aid &s;he, I cannot explain to you the nature of my &s;orrows, without acu&s;ing one, whom it is your duty to re&s;pect, I mu&s;t not make my child di&s;pi&s;e her father;" "I will not de|&s;pi&s;e him, I replied. If he can injure good|ne&s;s like your's I will pity and pardon him, and pray to heaven to turn his heart." But where is my father. He has been out all night &s;aid my mother. While you were at Mr. Rowley's ye&s;terday, he went out and has not returned &s;ince. Ju&s;t then I heard a chai&s;e drive up to the door and looking out &s;aw my father alight and hand out Mrs Talbot; the my&s;tery is unravelled &s;aid I; "go, &s;aid my mother, dry your eyes and appear at breakfa&s;t as compo&s;ed as you can; do not let them have the triumph of &s;eeing how much they di&s;tre&s;s us. I did as I was de&s;ired, but when I entered the breakfa&s;t parlour, I felt a glow of indignation flu&s;h my cheek, and I could hardly give them the compliments of the morning with any &s;teadine&s;s of accent. Mrs. Talbot fixed her penetrating black eyes up|on my face; I darted at her a look of anger, &s;he immediately ca&s;t them down, turned pale and &s;eemed much agitated; but whether it was with anger or &s;en&s;ibility I cannot determine.</P>

<P>This Mrs. Talbot is a wonderful woman: her conduct is an inexplicable riddle; her cha|racter undefinable.

She unfolded the paper, and &s;eeing a piece of fine chintz, enquired if there was enough for two gowns. "No," &s;aid my father, "I bought but one." "Then certainly, Sir, you did not mean it for me; only your politene&s;s leads you to offer it; permit me to re&s;ign it to the pro|per owner," laying it on my mother's knee.

and fly from errors, which originated in du|plicity on one &s;ide, and weakne&s;s on the other. I have wrote to my &s;i&s;ter, that I &s;hall leave Woodbine Cot to-morrow, and nothing &s;hall prevent my putting my de|&s;ign in execution." During the time Mrs. Talbot was &s;peaking, my father &s;tood like one petrefied; my mother's colour went and came alternately red and pale. Indeed I was afraid &s;he would have fainted. At length &s;he a&s;&s;umed &s;ufficient courage to a&s;k with tolerable compo&s;ure, how long &s;he had formed this re&s;olution, which appeared as &s;udden as it was unexpected. "Oh! my dear madam," &s;aid &s;he, "it is not a &s;udden re&s;olution, I have long had it in my mind, but always wanted fortitude to execute my re&s;olves; it is much ea&s;ier to ru&s;h into guilt, than to recede from it, and I have long learnt to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t my own vices without mak|ing one attempt to eradicate them.

Believe me, madam, had I &s;ooner known, how very amiable you were, I &s;hould never have injured you; but I was a &s;tran|ger to your goodne&s;s till it was too late to recall my error. When Mi&s;s Howard re|turned from France, it was impo&s;&s;ible to be an inmate in the hou&s;e with her and not love her. From loving virtue in others we

I wi&s;hed to obtain Mi&s;s Howard's friend&s;hip; but I knew I was unworthy of the ble&s;&s;ing. From that mo|ment I determined, if I could not merit her e&s;teem, I would at lea&s;t avoid her di&s;plea&s;ure and contempt; but alas!" continued &s;he; "I am too late; &s;he already de&s;pi&s;es me; and I feel I have not even a claim to her pity."</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake! what does all this mean," &s;aid my father, "who dares treat you with contempt, or in&s;ult you with their pity?"</P>
<P>"No one, Mr. Howard," &s;he replied calmly; "I only &s;ay it is what I have a right to expect; if you remember I told you a few days &s;ince that I was determined no longer to lead a life of infamy; you thought me then in je&s;t; perhaps you may think &s;o &s;till; believe me, 'tis of little con&s;equence to me, what opinion you may form of my conduct; I am anxious only to obtain the pardon of the&s;e ladies, of who&s;e merits I could wi&s;h you to be &s;en&s;ible, before you have inevita|bly de&s;troyed both their happine&s;s and your own."

taking one of my mother's hands, and one of mine, pre&s;&s;ed them alternately to her lips, and bur&s;ting into a fre&s;h flood of tears, left the room. My father followed her, and I heard them &s;peak very high in the adjoining apartment, but could di&s;tingui&s;h nothing that pa&s;t excepting the words, "never whil&s;t I have life," which were pronounced by Mrs. Talbot, as &s;he went up &s;tairs, where &s;he locked her&s;elf into her own room. My fa|ther went immediately out, nor was he re|turned while I &s;at up with my mother, who &s;eemed more melancholy than ever, and not inclined for conver&s;ation. This morning when we met at breakfa&s;t a heavy cloud hung on my father's brow. Mrs. Talbot was not come down. I went up to call her. The door was open. I went into the room; but found, by a letter which lay on the table, that &s;he had left the hou&s;e at four o'clock in the morning. The cloaths and other pre|&s;ents, which &s;he had received from my fa|ther, were packed up in a &s;mall trunk and directed for me. In her letter to my mo|ther, &s;he takes a long adieu, and &s;ays there is not the lea&s;t probability of our ever meet|ing again, as &s;he &s;hould leave England almo&s;t immediately. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the rage of my father, when he found &s;he was really gone. He &s;wore we had treated her ill, or &s;he never would have taken &s;uch a re|&s;olution.

In vain we prote&s;ted our innocence. He vented his rage in the mo&s;t ungentle|man-like terms, on my dear patient mo|ther, who could return nothing but tears. He is now taking his u&s;ual walk. I hope, when he returns, he will be calmer. I am weary, my dear Celia, and can write no more. Farewell. May good angels guard you.</P>

<P>I FOUND my&s;elf at the conclu&s;ion of my la&s;t letter, my dear &s;i&s;ter, totally unable to continue the &s;ubject, which I ju&s;t hinted to you. I wi&s;hed you to conceive the whole without de&s;cending to particulars, yet how it that po&s;&s;ible. At this moment you think me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="25" REF="029439_0045_0FE2A059E081EE10">
virtuous, but unfortunate woman; you al&s;o think Mr. Howard the mo&s;t benevolent, mo&s;t di&s;inter&s;ted of men: ah! my dear &s;i&s;|ter, how have you been deceived. But to make you under&s;tand more perfectly, I mu&s;t go back to the time when I lo&s;t Mr. Talbot.</P>
<P>A &s;tranger in London, alone unconnected with the world, deprived of the means of &s;upport by my hu&s;band's death. I was re|volving in my mind what plan to pur&s;ue in future; when chance introduced me to Mr. Howard. My dre&s;s declared me a widow. He paid me innumerable little attentions, whenever we met at the hou&s;e of an attorney, with who&s;e lady I was intimate, and at length from having frequently called with my friend, who was employed to &s;ettle my late hu&s;band's affairs, he a&s;&s;umed the privilege of vi&s;iting by him&s;elf. To you, who know him &s;o well, I need not de&s;cribe either the graces of his per&s;on, or his in&s;inuating ad|dre&s;s. Perfect ma&s;ter of the art of deception: he conceals under the ma&s;k of integrity and honour every vice which can di&s;grace human nature: with that ver&s;atality of temper which makes him appear every thing to every bo|dy; with the religious he is grave and &s;o|lemn; with the gay cheerful and affable, with the &s;plenetic he can rail at the vices and
<PB N="26" REF="029439_0046_0FE2A0615C3ACE80">
follies of mankind, and with the libertine practice tho&s;e vices him&s;elf: tho' where it is his intere&s;t he can appear devout, yet no man ever concieved a more contemptuous opinion of religion, or &s;trove with more diabolical earne&s;tne&s;s to corrupt the young and inex|perienced heart. When fir&s;t I was introduc|ed to him, I was told he was a married man. What was my wonder, then, when after a few vi&s;its he profe&s;&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion for me. I combated his &s;ophi&s;tical arguments as well as my weak rea&s;oning would permit; but alas! I lo&s;t ground in every argument. At length he told me as a &s;ecret, which nothing but the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion could have extorted from him, that he never did, nor ever could love his wife; that he had married her &s;olely to oblige his father, who was &s;ince dead, and that &s;he was a cold, inanimate woman, fit on|ly for the frigid rules, and &s;olemn rites of a convent. Then with the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;e|verations, he called heaven to witne&s;s that I was the only woman he ever loved; and called down the mo&s;t heavy maledictions on his head, if he &s;hould ever for&s;ake me.</P>
<P>Lucetta, I was infatuated; I thought him the tendere&s;t, be&s;t of men, and mourn'd a fate which had united him to a woman he could not love. Poverty and di&s;tre&s;s &s;ur|rounded me. Mr. Howard offered a &s;ettle|ment
<PB N="27" REF="029439_0047_0FE2A063544D3078">
of fifty pounds a year and to take me into his family, as a relation of his own. My &s;i&s;ter, do you now concieve the depth of my &s;hame. I accepted his offer, and a letter was di&s;patched, to let Mrs. Howard know, he had met with a relation, who&s;e circum|&s;tances were rather embarra&s;&s;ed and whom he had invited home, as he thought &s;he would prove an agreeable addition to their fa|mily. The return of po&s;t brought &s;uch an an&s;wer as might be expected from a woman, who&s;e chief &s;tudy was to plea&s;e and render her hu&s;band happy. When I arrived at Woodbine Cot, Mrs. Howard recieved me with a mixture of politene&s;s and affection. Never &s;hall I forget the &s;en&s;ations, which pervaded my bo&s;om, when entering a neat parlour, &s;he ro&s;e to welcome me. A&s;toni&s;h|ment riveted me to the &s;pot; unable to &s;peak or move, I &s;unk into the neare&s;t chair, and had nearly fainted. Figure to your&s;elf, my &s;i&s;ter, a woman, &s;carcely thirty years old, ele|gantly formed, with a countenance animated and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; her fine blue eyes beam|ing tenderne&s;s on the cruel betrayer of her peace. Think you hear her in accents &s;oft as the mu&s;ic of the &s;pheres, by turns cheer|ing and comforting the very woman who had robbed her of her hu&s;band's affections. And &s;urely then, you will not wonder, if un|able to &s;tifle my emotions, I gave way to a
<PB N="28" REF="029439_0048_0FE2A064D67F6258">
flood of tears. "You are too much affect|ed, my dear madam," &s;aid Mrs. Howard, taking my hand. "Do not I be&s;eech you give way to immoderate grief: when mi&s;|fortunes are irremidiable it is our duty to &s;ubmit without repining: but I flatter my|&s;elf, the united attentions of my dear Mr. Howard, and my&s;elf, will by degrees re&s;tore your tranquility. In the mean time, I hope you will con&s;ider your&s;elf at home, and be a&s;&s;ured, we &s;hall think our&s;elves happy in being able in the lea&s;t to contribute to your ca&s;e or felicity." She then led me to an ap|partment, which had been prepared for me, and left me, to that repo&s;e which con&s;cious guilt rendered me incapable of enjoying.</P>
<P>The more I knew of this amiable woman, the greater cau&s;e I found for admiration and re&s;pect. She being naturally of an open di&s;po&s;ition, I was in the cour&s;e of our inti|macy, made acquainted with the mo&s;t mate|rial circum&s;tances of her life: and from her I learnt that &s;he had brought a very hand|&s;ome fortune to Mr. Howard; and that they had married contrary to the advice of their friends on both &s;ides, as they had formed different views for them: but, &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;igh, "We thought love for each other would compen&s;ate for the privation of the &s;ociety of our other friends."</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="029439_0049_0FE2A06658B9A6A0">
I had not been long in this family, before I di&s;covered, that I was not the only woman, who &s;hared Mr. Howard's attention. He was neither careful to avoid &s;u&s;picion, nor deli|cate in the choice of his companions, as al|mo&s;t every female &s;ervant in the family, who was not proof again&s;t flattering vows and pre&s;ents of finery, had at &s;ome time or other attracted her ma&s;ter's notice. The amiable &s;uffering wife bore all with angelic patience, nor ever once breathed a murmur. I had the &s;atisfaction to find that my remon|&s;trances had &s;ome effect, and he became more circum&s;pect in his behaviour. I could al&s;o at any time re&s;train him from the pur|&s;uit of any new amour by threatning to leave him, and I flattered my&s;elf, that this in &s;ome mea&s;ure attoned to Mrs. Howard for the in|juries I did her. In this manner I continued in the family near three years, when I found an evident alteration in the conduct of my ho&s;te&s;s. Her manner was cold and di&s;tant; &s;he often avoided my &s;ociety and retired to her apartment, where I have &s;urprized her weeping. Con&s;cious guilt would not per|mit me to enquire the cau&s;e of her unea&s;i|ne&s;s, as I naturally imagined &s;he had di&s;co|vered my improper intimacy with her hu&s;|band: but one day while we were at Bri&s;tol, I overheard a conver&s;ation between them which determined me to quit a life, at once
<PB N="30" REF="029439_0050_0FE110E1FB019358">
&s;o repugnant to honour, humanity and re|ligion. It was one morning, as I was pre|paring to enter the breakfa&s;t room, the door of which was not quite &s;hut, when I heard Mr. Howard in a high key reproaching his wife for not behaving &s;o kindly as formerly to me. I wi&s;hed to know in what manner Mrs. Howard &s;poke of me, and therefore de|&s;cended to the meanne&s;s of li&s;tening. "My dear, Mr. Howard," &s;aid &s;he, "how is it po&s;&s;i|ble for me to behave with cordiality to a wo|man who I am well convinced has u&s;urped my place in your affections; and tho' I am wil|ling acknowledge the many amiable traits in her character, I cannot be blind to that one error, which embitters every hour of my life; nor am I mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;ufficient di&s;&s;imu|lation, to wear the face of friend&s;hip where my heart feels only di&s;like, nay almo&s;t di&s;|gu&s;t. I will not &s;cruple to confe&s;s, I once did e&s;teem her: but pardon the expre&s;&s;ion, if I &s;ay, the heart that loves virtue for its own &s;ake, can never form acquaintance with vice.

<P>"Hold madam," &s;aid he, "or I &s;hall be led to &s;uppo&s;e you de&s;pi&s;e me."</P>
<P>"No, Mr. Howard," &s;aid &s;he, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> animated voice, "you are the cho&s;en friend of my heart, the father of my chil|dren,

<P>Here &s;he wept, and Mr. Howard not being able to make a ju&s;t defence, flew into a vio|lent pa&s;&s;ion, as was his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, &s;wore &s;he was a mo&s;t unaccountable woman, and wondered at his own patience in bearing with her &s;o long. This unde&s;erved reproach awakened her &s;tifled pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he an&s;wered with intrepidity.</P>
<P>"No, &s;ir, it is my patience is to be wonder|ed at, but do not irritate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> beyond the po&s;&s;i|bility of &s;ubmitting any longer, I fear I have been wrong in &s;o long bearing my injuries in

&s;ilence; perhaps, you think, becau&s;e I ap|peared blind to your immoral conduct, I countenanced it. Let me undeceive you. Mrs. Talbot &s;hould not &s;o long have remain|ed under the &s;ame roof with me, had I not feared, that by depriving her of an a&s;ylum, I &s;hould injure her reputation and drive her into an inhuman world, where one fal&s;e &s;tep is never forgiven, and &s;he might have &s;unk into the lowe&s;t aby&s;s of vice and infamy. I flattered my&s;elf my gentlene&s;s might have reclaimed her. I knew, alas! too well, the incon&s;tancy of your nature, and had deter|mined that when for&s;aken by you, &s;he &s;hould not want a friend to &s;natch her from ever|la&s;ting ruin."</P>
<P>I was &s;o overcome by this generous decla|ration, that I was forced to catch hold of the ballu&s;trade of the &s;tairs, to prevent fall|ing. A &s;udden &s;ickne&s;s came over me, and I could not di&s;tinctly hear the remainder of their conver&s;ation; but, thank heaven, I profited &s;o much from what I had heard, that I re&s;olved no longer, by my pre&s;ence, to wound a heart &s;o replete with benevolence toward me. I did not enter the par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our; but returned to my own apartment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and, &s;ending an apology for not appearing at breakfa&s;t, revolved in my own mind a varie|ty of &s;chemes, for my future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but
<PB N="33" REF="029439_0053_0FE110F095E76C00">
could think on nothing that appeared in the lea&s;t probable of &s;ucce&s;s. That afternoon Mi&s;s Howard arrived from France. Had my mind been ever &s;o depraved it mu&s;t have returned to virtue after an acquaintance with this dear girl; I therefore became more firm in my re&s;olves; and having formed an acquaintance with an elderly lady, of who&s;e &s;en&s;e and goodne&s;s of heart I had a very high opinion; I determined to di&s;clo&s;e eve|ry particular of my &s;ituation to her, and a&s;k her advice in what manner I &s;hould proceed. She heard me with attention, and was friend|ly enough not to attempt to paliate my er|rors. She placed my conduct in a proper light and encouraged the remor&s;e which was already awakened in my bo&s;om. She then opened a &s;cene of comfort to my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed imagination, and having advi&s;ed me to re|turn with the family to Woodbine Cot, to prevent any ill natured remarks among our acquaintance, and afterwards to pur&s;ue the plan which &s;he had laid down. Yet, will you believe it, when I returned to this place I felt my re&s;olution &s;lacken, and found I was relap&s;ing into my former errors; but this morning the dear amiable Meriel has awak|ened my &s;leeping con&s;cience, and I am de|termined to leave the family immediately. I went into the garden after breakfa&s;t and found her weeping in a little arbour. "In

tears, my dear little girl," &s;aid I. "Have I not cau&s;e for tears," &s;he replied, "is not my beloved mother unhappy?"</P>
<P>"Unhappy!" &s;aid I, with an accent of &s;urpri&s;e, willing to try if &s;he was acquainted with the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>She fixed her expre&s;&s;ive eyes on my face, and replied emphatically; "&s;urely I need not tell you, Mrs. Talbot, that &s;he is very unhappy; for you profe&s;s your&s;elf her friend, and friend&s;hip is quick &s;ighted in di&s;cerning the &s;orrows of the per&s;on e&s;teemed: true friend&s;hip is al&s;o eagerly anxious to remove the cau&s;e of grief from the bo&s;om of tho&s;e they love, though by &s;o doing, they plant a thorn in their own."</P>
<P>I could not an&s;wer her; I did not even attempt it; but pre&s;&s;ing her hand in &s;ilence retired to another part of the garden.</P>

<P>"Oh! my dear girl, then," cried &s;he, in a &s;ort of exta&s;y; "you have a plea&s;ure to come, of which at pre&s;ent you can form no idea: I will lend you the books; but you mu&s;t not let your father &s;ee them."</P>
<P>And that you may believe me Celia, I &s;hall not; for he is always ready enough to abridge me of any thing that can afford me plea&s;ure. As to my dear mother, I am &s;ure &s;he will gratify every laudable wi&s;h of my heart; and &s;ure if Mi&s;s Pringle has reciev|ed &s;o much plea&s;ure in the peru&s;al of them, they cannot be improper books; at any rate,

when one hears a great deal about a thing, one naturally longs to &s;ee it. But after all it appears to me very odd that a man and&punc; woman cannot conver&s;e together without making love: I think it is a very fooli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and in my opinion a very fallacious one; for now I remember, Mr. Verdome travelled all the way from Bologne with me, and ne|ver &s;aid a &s;yllable about love or adoration.

<P>Well, to be &s;ure I do begin to be a little better plea&s;ed with the &s;ociety of our neigh|bours than I was at fir&s;t; indeed I feel my heart much lighter &s;ince Mrs. Talbot left us, for I &s;ee my dear mother looks happier; and if &s;he is happy I &s;hall be &s;o too. I &s;pent a very agreeable evening at Mrs. Pringle's, who&s;e &s;on arrived, ju&s;t as we had &s;at down to tea; I thought him a very plea&s;ing young man. He is an en&s;ign in the army, and has a military, manly countenance. I know not how it was, but whether from what Dolly had &s;aid in the morning, or whe|ther from my not being accu&s;tomed to the &s;ociety of men; yet I felt my&s;elf awkward and embarre&s;&s;ed; however, as Mr. Pringle
<PB N="40" REF="029439_0060_0FE1111142BD89C0">
did not &s;ay any thing particular, I &s;oon re|covered my&s;elf, tho' when Mrs. Pringle and her daughter left the room for a few mo|ments, I was frightened to death le&s;t he &s;hould make love to me, and you know, if he had I &s;hould not have known what to &s;ay to him. This fear, I am &s;ure, made me look like a fool; for I felt my face glow like &s;carlet. I dare &s;ay he thought me an idiot; well, it is of little con&s;equence to me what he thought: only you know one don't like &s;trangers to form an unju&s;t opinion of our mental faculties.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Pringle lent me the books which &s;he promi&s;ed: I did not dare to read any be|fore I went to bed, as my father often walks round the hou&s;e to &s;ee if all the lights are out; and if he had caught me reading, he would have immediately taken the books from me, for he has lately taken it into his head that I read too much, and that I &s;hall be good for nothing, if I am &s;uffered to pore &s;o much over a parcel of mu&s;ty old au|thors. So, I locked up my new acqui&s;itions in my clo&s;et, and aro&s;e two hours earlier this morning to peru&s;e it.

<P>Well, Celia, would you believe it, after having cried my&s;elf almo&s;t blind about the the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the dear ladies, who&s;e hi&s;to|ry I have been reading, I was agreeably &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find, in the end, all parties were made happy. I declare I was very much de|lighted, and cannot &s;ay but I &s;hould like to go into more company, and &s;ee a little more of life; for then perhaps I &s;hould meet with &s;ome &s;uch charming women as lady Frances and lady Caroline. Celia, I might al&s;o be admired by &s;ome fine gentleman, as they were; for I find country girls are as much engaged with love and lovers as the great ladies. I wi&s;h I could convey the&s;e books to you; or that you could get &s;ome ju&s;t like them. Perhaps the&s;e were the kind my fa|ther

meant, when he talked about romances and novels; but yet that cannot be, as this is a real hi&s;tory, the characters drawn from life. Mi&s;s Pringle has promi&s;ed to lend me &s;ome more of the &s;ame &s;ort, and &s;ome plays; &s;o I think I &s;hall pa&s;s my time much more agreeably than before; tho' do not think I mean to neglect tho&s;e authors our dear &s;i&s;ter Con&s;tance &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly recom|mended to my notice. No, no, my friend, I will not neglect the u&s;eful &s;tudies of hi&s;tory, geography, and far more nece&s;|&s;ary duty of public and private devotion; and now I am on the &s;ubject of devotion, I mu&s;t ju&s;t mention &s;omething in my father's cha|racter, which is to me unaccountable. Tho' he talked to me in the profane &s;tile I have related in a former letter, yet to my mother and the families who vi&s;it us, he pretends to have a high veneration for religion and reli|gious &s;ubjects, and as we live a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the church, he makes a prac|tice of reading the morning &s;ervice to the fa|mily; tho' perhaps the moment he has clo&s;ed the prayer book, &s;hould the mo&s;t trifling thing happen to ruffle his temper, he will bur&s;t in|to fits of ungovernable rage, and &s;wear in &s;uch a horrible manner, that I &s;hudder to hear him. There is a little boy, whom he has taken into the family, and whom he takes great pains to teach his catechi&s;m, &amp;c.

I have &s;een him whip the poor lad unmerci|fully for innocently humming a &s;ong tune on a Sunday morning, when he him&s;elf lives in the con&s;tant breach of almo&s;t every duty the chri&s;tian religion lays days down for our ob|&s;ervation and direction. Are not the&s;e in|con&s;i&s;tencies, Celia? Surely the father of children, the ma&s;ter of a family, &s;hould &s;et a good example, or he can never expect others to attend to duties he &s;o evidently appears to di&s;regard.</P>
<P>My dear old nur&s;e, Deborah, arrived ye&s;|terday, from a vi&s;it &s;he has been paying her friends ever &s;ince our return from the con|tinent. She enquired when I had heard from you; de&s;ires you will not forget her. Of this I a&s;&s;ured her, &s;he need not be afraid. Her return is another &s;ource of comfort to me, as my mother &s;ays &s;he &s;hall continue in the family as long as &s;he plea&s;es, and you know the affection I have contracted for her, from her attendance on me the whole time I was abroad, indeed I con&s;ider her almo&s;t in a maternal light, her fidelity and attach|ment to our family has been ever un&s;haken.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Pringle called this afternoon, and we walked in the garden together near an hour, during which time &s;he told me her brother was greatly &s;truck with my per&s;on,
<PB N="44" REF="029439_0064_0FE1112501845610">
and that he had told his mother, if he thought I would return his pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould immediately relinqui&s;h the idea he had formed of marrying a woman, to whom the whole family had the greate&s;t di&s;like, as &s;he was ignorant, low born and without for|tune. "How happy &s;hall I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my dear Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid &s;he, "to call you &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me," &s;aid I, "how can you talk &s;o, you know I mu&s;t not think of li&s;tening to a lover without my father's permi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Your father indeed," cried &s;he laughing, "I wonder what your dear little &s;imple head will fancy next: why child, he would forbid me the hou&s;e if he only &s;u&s;pected &s;uch a thing; and you know my dear Meriel," (&s;he continned in a &s;oft &s;oothing accent) "you know, we are bo&s;om friends and &s;worn &s;i&s;ters and it would be very hard, you know, to be &s;eparated, perhaps forever."</P>
<P>"Indeed Mi&s;s Pringle," &s;aid I, "my heart feels grateful for the friend&s;hip you profe&s;s for me, and I &s;hould be very &s;orry to be deprived of your &s;ociety."</P>
<P>"Well, then my dear," &s;aid &s;he, "take this letter and don't let either your father or your mother &s;ee it." I would have refu&s;ed
<PB N="45" REF="029439_0065_0FE1112A6F3EE8E0">
the letter, as I feared it would be improper to take it; but my father ju&s;t then entering the garden, I dreaded his anger which is awakened at the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant trifles, and is always impetuous: &s;o I ha&s;tily put it in my pocket.</P>
<P>When we returned to the hou&s;e and Mi&s;s Pringle was gone, he cried petti&s;hly to my another; "what does that girl do &s;o often here? I &s;hall have Meriel &s;poiled by her non&s;en&s;ical chatter; be&s;ides I will lay a gui|nea there is an intrigue of &s;ome &s;ort contriving between them; I never knew two girls al|lowed to be &s;o much together but they hatched mi&s;chief." "If you do not like Dolly Pringle," replied my mother, "we will try to drop her acquaintance, but you mu&s;t con&s;ider, Mr. Howard, Meriel mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;ociety." "Why, pray what &s;o|ciety would &s;he have," &s;aid he, "are not you always with her, and has &s;he not plenty of needle work to do? let her &s;tick clo&s;e to that, and &s;he won't want to be gadding and go&s;&s;iping: &s;he is at pre&s;ent a &s;tranger to the world, and the le&s;s &s;he knows of it the bet|ter." This unkindne&s;s does not grieve me as it would if I loved him; but it gives me pain to &s;ee how much it affects my mother. I &s;at down to &s;upper in &s;ilence, and when it was fini&s;hed, retired as u&s;ual to my own

<P>I HAVE been very unhappy, Celia, &s;ince I wrote la&s;t; indeed I did not know whe|ther I &s;hould be permitted to write to you again: nor could I now enjoy that &s;atisfac|tion if good Deborah had not procured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pens, ink, and &s;ome paper; which &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on conditions of &s;eeing all I wrote; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="47" REF="029439_0067_0FE1113365303F98">
have left my bed at the early hour of four, to pour forth my complaints to my dear Celia. In my la&s;t I told you I had reciev|ed a letter from Mr. Pringle, declaring him|&s;elf my lover: I will own I was very much plea&s;ed with it. Tho' at fir&s;t I he&s;itated to an&s;wer it, yet, when I read a few more books, which Mi&s;s Dolly Pringle &s;ent me by means of our dairy maid, and I found that none of the young ladies mentioned in them ever he&s;itated at an&s;wering their lover's letters; I ventured to write a few lines in reply to one which he &s;ent me reque&s;ting me to meet him one night after the family were in bed, and in which he told me, Lettice the maid would come and let me know, when all was quiet in the hou&s;e, and that &s;he would go with me to the place he had appointed for our meeting. Indeed, Celia, I did not think any harm; &s;o I wrote and told him if his &s;i&s;|ter would come with him, I would meet him, for I wi&s;hed very much to &s;ee Dolly, and I knew I &s;hould not have another opportunity very &s;oon.</P>
<P>When we met, his manner was &s;o tender, his language &s;o pathetic, and the tender at|tentions of his &s;i&s;ter &s;o like what I had read, that I could not help confe&s;&s;ing that I pitied him, and that if it would in the lea&s;t alleviate his &s;uffering, I would meet him there again.
<PB N="48" REF="029439_0068_0FE11135EE6067F0">
We went on thus for &s;ome time, when over|powered one evening by his entreaties, I con|&s;ented to go with him to London, where he promi&s;ed to marry me. Dear, dear, Celia, I tremble even now, when I think of what fol|lowed. The next day we had ju&s;t done break|fa&s;t, when an elderly gentleman who has a great regard for my father and mother called, and telling the latter he had &s;omething very particular to &s;ay to her, they walked to|gether into the garden. When they returned, I &s;aw my dear mother, oh! I &s;hall never for|get it, I &s;aw her look extremely angry, her eyes darted at me &s;uch indignant glances, that my very &s;oul felt humbled within me, I could have fallen at her feet and intreated to know the cau&s;e of her anger: for indeed, Celia, I did not think, if &s;he had even di&s;|covered my corre&s;pondence with young Prin|gle, that &s;he would have been &s;o very much offended, e&s;pecially as I could appeal for a precedent, to the conduct of &s;o many amiable young ladies of even rank and fortune. But the moment Mr. Sutten was gone, &s;he a&s;ked me in a tone that rent my very heart, how I dared either to receive or write letters with|out her knowledge. Her anger overpowered me; &s;omething ro&s;e in my throat and pre|vented my &s;peaking, I thought I &s;hould have died with &s;orrow, when &s;he thus continued, "Unkind, ungenerous Meriel, thus to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="49" REF="029439_0069_0FE1113BAFA78DF0">
the confidence your mother had placed in you. How, degenerate girl, have you dared to violate the laws of female delicacy, by openly avowing a pa&s;&s;ion for a man to whom you are almo&s;t a &s;tranger, and even to make your&s;elf ridiculous by writing &s;uch letters to him as renders you the je&s;t of the whole village." "Oh! my dear mother," &s;aid I in a voice almo&s;t choaked with &s;obs; "indeed I did not think any harm." "Perhaps, Meri|el," &s;aid &s;he, "had you &s;topped here, I might have forgiven you: but know, fal&s;e di&s;em|bling girl, I have di&s;covered all your illicit plans, you have left your father's hou&s;e at hours, when mode&s;ty would have &s;hrunk to venture out, without a proper protector: and, to compleat your imprudence, this very night you had de&s;igned to quit a mother, whom you have pretended to love and re|&s;pect, and to throw your&s;elf intirely into the power of a wretch, who regards you only as a vehicle, thro' which he may come at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your fortune."</P>
<P>I fell at her feet and would have taken her hand; but &s;he &s;natched it from me, and and ri&s;ing from her &s;eat left me weeping on the ground.</P>
<P>"Unworthy girl," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he left the room, "go hide your&s;elf from my &s;ight, for
<PB N="50" REF="029439_0070_0FE1113E9E6AE168">
you are become odious to me. Never, never, child, can you regain the confidence you have lo&s;t. I had flattered my&s;elf with find|ing in you a comforter and tender filial friend; but you have added another wound to a heart already lacerated by many &s;or|rows."</P>
<P>When my mother was gone, I laid my head upon a chair and continued weeping. In this po&s;ition my father found me. "So, Mi&s;s," &s;aid he, &s;ternly, "I find you were for providing a hu&s;band for your&s;elf; you were re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time; but pray what will you &s;ay when I tell you this fine lover of your's is already married and has been &s;o the&s;e two years."</P>
<P>"Married, &s;ir" cried I, rai&s;ing my head.</P>
<P>"Yes child, married, though his friends were unacquainted with it, but this morning I hear his wife is arrived from London, with one child, to &s;olicit that &s;upport which he has inhumanly refu&s;ed her." I made no an&s;wer, but returning my head to its reclin|ing po&s;ture, continued weeping without in|termi&s;&s;ion. "Ah! my poor little Meriel," &s;aid he, in a tone of voice more &s;oft than u&s;ual, "I am afraid this naughty man has made great havock with your heart; but,
<PB N="51" REF="029439_0071_0FE111444171A100">
come, come, you &s;hall not wear the willow long, we will find another lover for you &s;oon."</P>
<P>"Indeed, &s;ir, you mi&s;take the cau&s;e of my tears," &s;aid I. "It is not the lo&s;s of all the lovers in the world would grieve me half &s;o much as the fear of having forever for|feited my dear mother's affection."</P>
<P>"Well, well," he replied, "don't let that vex you; if &s;he is unkind, I will endea|vour to attone for it. To be &s;ure, &s;he is ve|ry rigid in her notions, but I dare &s;ay, when &s;he &s;ees you heartily repent your fault, &s;he will overlook it and love you as well as ever."</P>
<P>He then left me, and I retired to my apartment, where Deborah told me my mo|ther had been, and had carried all my pens, ink and paper away with her. Ever &s;ince &s;he has been cold, di&s;tant, nay almo&s;t un|kind. Oh! my dear friend, what &s;hall I do to regain her affection, and convince her my repentance is &s;incere. Indeed, &s;he is to me the deare&s;t object upon earth, and her hap|pine&s;s &s;hall henceforth be my only &s;tudy.</P>
<P>My father, when my mother is pre&s;ent, treats me with equal rigour; but, when we
<PB N="52" REF="029439_0072_0FE11146A9C33538">
are alone, he is more gentle. Once or twice he has come to my apartment when &s;he was out, and even brought me &s;ome books; among which were &s;ome French novels. Even my brother has heard of my impru|dence, and has wrote to my mother, enquir|ing the truth of the report; but he does not write as if he wi&s;hed it fal&s;e. I do not think he loves me; he had expected a legacy from Mrs. Mirvan, but the whole of her fortune being left to me, has created envy and jea|lou&s;y in a bo&s;om, which I had once flattered my&s;elf I &s;hould find warm with friendly and fraternal love: and yet, Celia, if he did but know my heart, he would &s;ee he had no cau&s;e to envy me, except he &s;hould envy tho&s;e delightful &s;en&s;ations which I &s;hall feel when I come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my fortune, in &s;aying, brother, it is equally your's, com|mand it to its utmo&s;t extent.</P>
<P>Deborah has promi&s;ed me to get this let|ter conveyed to the neare&s;t po&s;t town.

<SALUTE>DEAR MISS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE, you will pardon this freedom in a poor old woman, who is almo&s;t bro|ken hearted, at an accident which has di&s;|tracted the whole family. I hardly know how to tell you, becau&s;e I know you loved and valued my dear young lady; and &s;o indeed mu&s;t every one who knew her merits, tho' &s;ince &s;he has returned from France, I have heard her ridiculed for virtues which
<PB N="54" REF="029439_0074_0FE1114EE53AF1E0">
few, if any, endeavoured to imitate; and have &s;een her drawn into errors, by tho&s;e who, envying the &s;uperior qualities of her heart, endeavoured to bring her more on a level with them&s;elves. She &s;hewed me the la&s;t letter &s;he wrote to you; for it was only on condition of &s;eeing all &s;he wrote, that I &s;upplied her with the means of following her favourite amu&s;ement. The &s;ternne&s;s of her mother &s;till continued; and the poor young lady was abridged of the plea&s;ure of even walking beyond the limits of her fa|ther's garden. Mr. Howard's conduct, towards the dear girl, was altogether un|accountable, &s;ometimes har&s;h, unfeelingly reproaching her for her intended error; a method, in my poor humble opinion, by no means calculated to lead her to renounce the attachment, which hurried her to &s;o impro|per a &s;tep. At other times, he turned the whole affair into ridicule, and conver&s;ed with his daughter in a gay familiar manner; but tho' &s;he trembled at his anger, &s;he never ex|pre&s;&s;ed any &s;atisfaction in his company when good humoured; but rather wi&s;hed to in|dulge in &s;olitude and &s;tudy. About ten days &s;ince my mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;ent for, into E&s;&s;ex, to a relation, who was extremely ill. Mr. Howard did not accompany her: &s;he &s;et off in the afternoon, and he having procured a chai&s;e took Mi&s;s Meriel out for a ride, an

indulgence &s;he had never experienced &s;ince her re&s;idence at this place. When &s;he re|turned &s;he &s;eemed very melancholy, and &s;aid her &s;pirits were much oppre&s;&s;ed, and her mind harra&s;&s;ed with terrors, for which &s;he could by no means account. She &s;upped with her father and retired at her u&s;ual hour. Mr. Howard &s;at up much later than common, and to my great &s;urpri&s;e, when I carried in his candle, he &s;eemed intoxicated, tho' he had been alone and &s;eldom gave way to exce&s;&s;ive drinking, unle&s;s he had been led into it by company. I heard him go in|to his apartment, and then went to bed my|&s;elf, where the fatigue of the day &s;oon made me fall a&s;leep. About two o'clock I was awakened by Mi&s;s Howard, who in a &s;hiver|ing voice a&s;ked me if I had not heard a noi&s;e in her chamber, &s;aid, &s;he was greatly frightened, and would, if I plea&s;ed, &s;tay the remainder of the night with me. I helped her into bed; &s;he was cold as death, trem|bled exce&s;&s;ivly, and &s;oonfell into a convul&s;ive hy&s;teric fit. Greatly alarmed, I called up one of my fellow &s;ervants, and by repeated applications of hart&s;horn, vinegar, &amp;c. brought her to her&s;elf; &s;he would give no account of the cau&s;e of her fright; but &s;eem|ed to mourn &s;ome heavy misfortune, and re|peatedly wi&s;hed her&s;elf with you in the con|vent again. She re&s;ted but little all night,

and the next morning was &s;o indi&s;po&s;ed as to be unable to ri&s;e, and was confined to her room for &s;everal &s;ucceeding days. One day after &s;he had ventured down &s;tairs; I a&s;ked leave to go a few miles, on &s;ome par|ticular bu&s;ine&s;s, where I was detained all night, by rea&s;on of a violent &s;torm. Ri&s;ing early in the morning, and walking home be|fore any of the family but the hou&s;e maids was &s;tirring, I went up immediately to &s;ee how my dear Mi&s;s Meriel was, for I had been very unea&s;y about her all night, know|ing &s;he was terrified at thunder, and would not dare to expre&s;s her fears to her father, who would only have ridiculed them. On entering the room I was alarmed to find the bed in great di&s;order; many of her cloaths laying about the floor, the window open, and my beloved Mi&s;s Howard gone. Ob|&s;erving the &s;heets fa&s;tened to the bed-po&s;t, I naturally imagined &s;he mu&s;t have &s;lid by them into the garden, and looking out at the window I &s;aw one of her &s;hoes lay on the ground. Convinced now, of what be|fore I had only conjectured, I gave a &s;cream of terror which alarmed my ma&s;ter, who came half dre&s;&s;ed, pale and trembling into the room, exclaiming, "for God's &s;ake what is the noi&s;e about." "My young lady, &s;ir," &s;aid I, pointing to the window. "Elop|ed," &s;aid he, "with that villain, Pringle; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

here I &s;ware never again to &s;uffer"&mdash;"Oh, &s;ir!" cried I eagerly, "do not &s;ware to re|nounce her; I'd venture my life upon her innocence; I am &s;ure &s;ome vile means have been u&s;ed to draw her thus from her duty."</P>
<P>"She is a little hypocrite, nur&s;e," &s;aid he, "and will make her&s;elf friends wherever &s;he goes, till &s;he is found out. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will trump up &s;ome fine &s;tory about ill u&s;age, or &s;ome devili&s;h thing or other. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to my &s;oul &s;he had never left the convent; this will go near to break her mother's heart."</P>
<P>About noon Mrs. Howard returned. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe her angui&s;h when in|formed of her daughter's ab&s;ence (I will not &s;ay elopement) becau&s;e I am &s;ure, if the truth was known, it would not de&s;erve &s;o har&s;h an appellation. She &s;ent immediately to Mrs. Pringle's, where &s;he heard that the young gentleman went away, as he &s;aid, to join his regiment the afternoon before. Thus does this unlucky circum&s;tance tend to make it univer&s;ally believed, that Mi&s;s Howard and Mr. Pringle are together; but, indeed Mi&s;s, I do not think that is the ca&s;e; for, certain I am, that a purer heart never inhabited a hu|man bo&s;om, and that &s;he never would have thought of eloping with a married man: be|&s;ides, I am convinced &s;he was not greatly at|tached to him. He was the fir&s;t man who had
<PB N="58" REF="029439_0078_0FE111611A553DD0">
ever addre&s;&s;ed her; &s;he is the pure child of un|di&s;gui&s;ed nature, and being plea&s;ed with his attentions which had the charm of novelty to recommend them; &s;he fancied her&s;elf in love; but after her conduct had been placed in a proper light, by her mother, &s;he &s;eemed perfectly convinced of her error, and often u&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;he wondered how &s;he could imagine &s;he loved a man, of whom &s;he knew &s;o little. "I &s;hould think, nur&s;e," &s;aid &s;he one day, "that this unfortunate affair in the end would be greatly beneficial to me, as it will make me, in future, di&s;tru&s;t the emotions of my heart, and be upon my guard again&s;t its deceptions; but I fear it has irreparably in|jured me in the opinion of my mother; but I mu&s;t endeavour, by my future conduct, to regain her confidence, and in the mean time, &s;ubmit with patience to that di&s;plea&s;ure I am certain I have in a great mea&s;ure de&s;erved." Such &s;entiments as the&s;e, madam, do not ar|gue a depravity of heart. Oh! no, my &s;weet Meriel is at this moment as free from guilt as an angel. Three days are now elap&s;ed &s;ince her departure, during which time no tidings can be gained concerning her. Oh! Mi&s;s, I fear we &s;hall never &s;ee the dear creature again: &s;ome dreadful my&s;tery is certainly concealed by her thus abruptly leaving her father's hou&s;e. Would to hea|ven I had the means of clearing it up, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

at the &s;ame time removing the cloud which at pre&s;ent ob&s;cures the reputation of the mo&s;t innocent young lady that ever exi&s;ted. I will not fini&s;h this letter till to-morrow. If we hear no tidings then, I &s;hall give her up as lo&s;t forever.</P>

<P>I ju&s;t &s;natch up my pen to inform you, dear Mi&s;s, that Mi&s;s Howard is found, and is at pre&s;ent in her father's hou&s;e; but in &s;uch a &s;ituation that we have little hope of her ever recovering her &s;en&s;es &s;ufficient to give any regular account of the cau&s;e of her flight, of this we are certain, &s;he was not with Mr. Pringle.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 28<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>I am now &s;itting by my poor young lady's bed &s;ide, who is ju&s;t fallen into a &s;weet re|fre&s;hing &s;leep, and &s;hall &s;eize this opportu|nity to inform you, in what manner &s;he was di&s;covered and conducted home. A farmer who lives about five miles from hence, at the &s;kirt of a wood, having occa&s;ion for his hor&s;e to be brought from pa&s;ture early in the morning, ordered a lad who lived as a &s;er|vant with him, to go by four o'clock and fetch it: the lad's way lay thro' the wood, and when he returned he declared he had been
<PB N="60" REF="029439_0080_0FE1116BB880F358">
frightened almo&s;t to death by an apparition of a woman, dre&s;&s;ed all in white, whom he &s;aw &s;itting at the foot of a tree as he went; that he heard her &s;igh and groan, and &s;aid he &s;uppo&s;ed it was the &s;pirit of Fanny Summers, who hung her&s;elf there la&s;t autumn, and he was the more po&s;itive of this, as at his return, he &s;aw her walking too and fro with a child in her arms and heard her talk to it. The farmer laughed at the lad's tale, and rode away without paying any farther attention to it, but a young gentleman who has a lodg|ings at the farmers, on account of an ill &s;tate of health, having over heard the boy's &s;tory, determined to ri&s;e immediately and go to the wood to inve&s;tigate the matter farther, as he &s;uppo&s;ed it might be &s;ome unfortunate human creature, rather than a &s;upernatural being; and determined, if in his power, to re&s;cue her from mi&s;ery, and, what ap|peared more than probable, a horrid and un|timely end. He had not penetrated far into the wood before he di&s;covered, at the foot of an old oak, a female form &s;tretched on the ground, and by her &s;ide a little &s;paniel, who&s;e head lay on the woman's arm, and who at frequent intervals &s;eemed to make mo&s;t pi|tious moans. He approached and found the unfortunate female was in a fit, he gently rai&s;ed her from the ground, &s;upporting her in his arms whil&s;t he chaffed her temples with
<PB N="61" REF="029439_0081_0FE1117163BAFCE8">
volatiles, which, on account of his own weak con&s;titution, he always carried in his pocket. While he was thus employed, the dog fawn|ed upon him licked his hand and &s;hewed every token of gratitude in his power; at length the lady began to move, and her pre|&s;erver hearing the voices of labourers pa&s;&s;ing through the wood, hallowed to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. When they came near, the dog flew from his mi&s;tre&s;s to one of them, leaping, bounding and howling for joy. What Lu|bin, &s;aid the clown, how come you here, then drawing nearer to help &s;upport the lady; he &s;tarted back and cried, body o'me, 'tis Mi&s;s Meriel, poor dear &s;oul, how could &s;he get here, as &s;ure as any thing &s;he has been robbed and murdered. Almo&s;t &s;miling at the fellow's &s;tupidity, the young gentleman bid him cea&s;e his wonder and a&s;|&s;i&s;t in bearing her to the farm which was the neare&s;t hou&s;e. The dear creaure never &s;poke during the whole time, indeed &s;he &s;eemed totally incapable of uttering a word, when they got her to the hou&s;e &s;he drank a few &s;poonfulls of milk, which &s;omewhat revived her, but her voice was &s;till &s;o weak they were unable to di&s;tingui&s;h what &s;he &s;aid, and her eyes too plainly indicated that her mind was di&s;turbed, the good woman of the hou&s;e had her put immediately to bed, and I&s;aac the labourer came home to let his ma&s;ter and

mi&s;tre&s;s know were their daughter was. When he told the melancholy tale, Mrs. Howard cla&s;ped her hands and cried, my child deprived of her &s;en&s;es! &s;he had not time for more, for Mr. Howard had fallen on the floor in a fit. I cannot account for this violent emotion in a man, who had ne|ver &s;hewn any great degree of tenderne&s;s towards his child, but I think I never &s;aw the fonde&s;t parent more affected.</P>
<P>When the family became tolerably com|po&s;ed, it was propo&s;ed that I &s;hould take a chai&s;e and proceed to the farm, when if Mi&s;s Howard was able to bear the motion of the carriage, I was to conduct her home; if not, to remain with her; and her mother would come to her in the morning. When I arrived at the farm, and was &s;hewn into the room where my dear young lady was; my agitation was &s;o great I thought I &s;hould have died; &s;he had on being fir&s;t put to bed fallen into a little doze, but &s;oon &s;tarted and awoke in great terror, and finding her&s;elf undre&s;&s;ed, &s;creamed out, "oh heavens! I am betrayed, I am lo&s;t, he is here; I know he is here, and I will not &s;tay another mo|ment." She then in&s;i&s;ted on being dre&s;&s;ed. The neighbouring apothecary had been pre|viou&s;ly &s;ent for; he felt her pul&s;e and de|clared that the di&s;order lay entirely on her
<PB N="63" REF="029439_0083_0FE1117B04187640">
&s;pirits; that every nerve &s;eemed convul&s;ed, and &s;he al&s;o appeared to be greatly weaken|ed for want of proper &s;u&s;tenance. She was prevailed on to eat a bit of bread, and drink a little weak wine and water; after which &s;he became a little more compo&s;ed, and had &s;unk into a profound &s;leep on the &s;ide of the bed. In this &s;ituation I found her; the faithful Lubin laying on a chair that &s;tood by the bed &s;ide, his head &s;tretched out to the pillow of his mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he had not quitted for a moment &s;ince her entrance into the hou&s;e. This dog had been mi&s;&s;ing ever &s;ince Mi&s;s Howard's ab&s;ence, but our minds had been occupied by thoughts of &s;o much more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a nature that Lubin was hardly remembered; he was greatly at|tached to her from her fir&s;t return, and &s;he remarkably fond of him. I &s;at down &s;ilent|ly on the &s;ide of the bed, and looked at her dear countenance which &s;o lately wore the bloom of youth and the &s;mile of innocent chearfulne&s;s: alas! how changed, deadly pale where her cheeks and lips, and only that I percieved &s;he breathed, I &s;hould have thought &s;he was no longer an inhabitant of this world; my tears flowed plentifully. Her &s;leep, tho' apparantly &s;ound, was not of long continuance; &s;he &s;hrieked, awoke, and immediately &s;tarted off the bed; I caught her hand, &s;he turned ha&s;tily round. "Oh! it is
<PB N="64" REF="029439_0084_0FE1117DCB43A2F0">
you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is it, well now we will go. If you will accompany me, &s;ay &s;o at once, if not I mu&s;t go without you; for I cannot &s;tay here another moment. But where is he now," looking wildly round her, "Who are you talking of my dear," &s;aid I, tender|ly. "Ah! there is the thing now, I thought you would want to know his name, but I cannot tell you nur&s;e, &s;o do not a&s;k me; I have made a vow, a &s;olemn &s;acred vow, ne|ver to wound the peace of my dear, adored, mother." "But my dear creature you have almo&s;t broken her heart by thus flying from her protection and your father." "Father," &s;aid &s;he, "have I a father? Oh! that I had never been born." She then began to rave in a mo&s;t incoherent manner, and de|clared &s;he would not &s;tay another moment in the hou&s;e. I took this opportunity with the permi&s;&s;ion of the apothecary to convey her home: when the chai&s;e &s;topped at the door &s;he looked out, and clapping her hand to her forehead, cried "yes I &s;ee how it is, well, well, it will not be long before I am relea&s;ed, and till then, I mu&s;t be patient." I a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in alighting, &s;he leaned on my arm and walked &s;lowly into the hou&s;e; Mrs. Howard was &s;o overcome &s;he was unable to ri&s;e from her &s;eat. Meriel looked for a moment at her attentively, then &s;haking her head in a mo&s;t &s;orrowful manner, &s;he
<PB N="65" REF="029439_0085_0FE11183E33EEB30">
cried, "oh! I &s;ee I have afflicted you, but, alas! my own heart is overwhelmed with &s;orrow; and then when I think for a moment, there are &s;ome remembrances which mu&s;t be ever buried in my heart, that torture me &s;o, my brain &s;eems on fire." Mrs. Howard attempt|ed to &s;peak, but unequal to the ta&s;k, &s;he cla&s;ped her hands in an agony, and &s;obbed aloud: Meriel &s;unk on her knees before her, took both her hands, put them fir&s;t to her head and then to her heart; and breath|ing a deep &s;igh, fell lifele&s;s on the floor. We had her immediately conveyed to bed, where &s;he &s;oon recovered; but a violent fever come on, and &s;he continued raving all night. Mr. Howard has not yet &s;een her, he &s;ays if the girl's &s;pirits are in &s;uch perturbation, the &s;ight of him, whom &s;he mu&s;t be con&s;cious &s;he has offended, would only irritate them more, when &s;he is better I will &s;ee her, &s;aid he, and forgive her, that will calm and com|fort her.</P>
<P>A phy&s;ician was &s;ent for; he &s;aid quiet and tenderne&s;s from tho&s;e about her are the chief things requi&s;ite to re&s;tore her. In the mean time, my dear madam, &s;aid he, I will &s;end her a compo&s;ing draught; if when &s;he recovers the u&s;e of her rea&s;on, you can pre|vail with her to unburthen her mind, which, I am certain labours with &s;ome painful &s;e|cret,

it would greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t and ha&s;ten her recovery.</P>
<P>Thus far, my dear Mi&s;s, have I given you an account of this my&s;terious affair. What to think of her &s;udden departure, and being found in &s;uch a &s;hocking &s;ituation, we are all totally at a lo&s;s. It appears &s;he has been terrified and extremely ill u&s;ed by &s;omebody; but even in the mo&s;t violent paroxi&s;ms of her delirium, &s;he has never mentioned his name. I have one thought that haunts me continually; but that is &s;o horrible I dare not commit it to paper. Indeed, it is too dreadful, too &s;hocking to human nature, to wear even the face of probability.</P>
<P>The medicines pre&s;cribed have taken the de&s;ired effect, and &s;he has been in a compo&s;ed &s;leep above three hours. I will not conclude till I can inform you how &s;he appears on awaking, as I know your affection for her will make you extremely anxious.</P>
<P>She awoke tolerably calm, in&s;tantly recol|lected where &s;he was, but did not &s;eem to retain any idea of the late unhappy events. "It is late, nur&s;e," &s;aid &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her|&s;elf to me "is it not time to get up," then pau&s;ing a moment, "I have had &s;uch a hor|rid dream. Oh! I would not pa&s;s &s;uch an|other

night:" &s;he then attempted to ri&s;e; but finding her&s;elf extremely weak, &s;he con|tinued, "what is the matter; have I been ill?" "Yes, my love," &s;aid I, "you have been very ill, and are far from well now." "Then perhaps it was not a dream," &s;aid &s;he, putting her hand to her forehead, as if try|ing to recollect; &s;he was &s;ilent for a few mo|ments, then caught hold my hand, and bur&s;ting into tears, &s;he cried, "alas! it was all a reality."</P>
<P>I did not attempt to &s;top her tears, as I thought they would relieve her. She a&s;ked for her mother; &s;eemed plea&s;ed to &s;ee her, but was too weak to talk much. The phy&s;ician has ju&s;t &s;een her, and declares her in a fair way to do well. I hope, Mi&s;s, you will excu&s;e all errors in this long letter, as I thought you would be anxious to know all the particulars, I have dwelt on the &s;ub|ject more than perhaps was nece&s;&s;ary, but will now no longer intrude.</P>

<P>ONCE more, my beloved Celia, I am permitted to addre&s;s you; but I will not addre&s;s you in the voice of complaint, becau&s;e I might have been far more wretch|ed than I am. Much gratitude is therefore due to that benignant power, who has pro|tected me through many dangers, and &s;aved me from an evil which I could hardly have endured and lived. My &s;en&s;es too are re|&s;tored, my life pre&s;erved by almo&s;t a mira|cle; and &s;hall I, &s;urrounded by the&s;e marvel|ous ble&s;&s;ings, dare to repine becau&s;e I do not enjoy that tranquility of heart which young women of my age and fortune in general po&s;|&s;e&s;s.

&s;eek ea&s;e by pouring forth its &s;orrows to that dear friendly girl, who will pity and &s;ooth them. You mu&s;t, long ere this, have re|ceived Deborah's letter, which has no doubt filled you with amazement. It is my &s;ad ta&s;k to explain to you the my&s;tery that inve|lopes my conduct. To no other per&s;on breathing will I unfold my labouring heart: no, not even to kind hearted Deborah, or my my dear &s;uffering mother: but to you, Celia, to you who&s;e thoughts are detached from the world, to you who will con&s;ider this con|fidence as &s;acred: to you I will venture to di&s;clo&s;e a &s;cene, the remembrance of which, even at this moment, chills the vital tide that nouri&s;hes my heart. But you, my gentle friend, well I know, tho' &s;truck with horror at the tale I &s;hall unfold, will join with me in offering to the throne of grace, fervent prayers for the author of my &s;orrows. "Oh thou Father, creator of the univer&s;e, look down upon him, pardon his manifold of|fences, touch his heart that he may &s;ee his errors, and oh! of thy infinite mercy, blot this la&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion from the book of life."

<P>The day my mother went into E&s;&s;ex I felt my &s;pirits unu&s;ually oppre&s;&s;ed, I rode out in the afternoon with my father, he
<PB N="70" REF="029439_0090_0FE111990ABE9470">
was extremely gay in his conver&s;ation, in|deed, I thought too much &s;o, as he treated &s;ome &s;ubjects with a levity which greatly &s;hocked me, and &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions e&s;caped him which wounded my delicacy, but this did not &s;o much &s;urpri&s;e me as he had fre|quently indulged him&s;elf in very improper conver&s;ation, not only before me, but other young women, who vi&s;ited at the hou&s;e, for which my mother always reproved him, but he in general turned it off with a laugh. However, as I had no per&s;on with me in the chai&s;e, his manner was extremely embara&s;|&s;ing, nay even di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, for he &s;aluted me &s;everal times, told me he was afraid of &s;hew|ing much affection to me before my mother, who in her heart hates me; but, that if I was a good girl, he would not care for my mother, but &s;hew me every kindne&s;s in his power; that I &s;hould go where I plea&s;ed, and do whatever my inclinations led me to. A&s;|toni&s;hed at this conver&s;ation, I hardly knew what to an&s;wer, and was extremely glad when we got home. I would have retired immediately to my appartment, but he in|&s;i&s;ted on my &s;taying to &s;up with him, &s;aying he had ordered a chicken on purpo&s;e for me. I reluctantly complied. During &s;upper he drank very freely and would have had me drink &s;everal gla&s;&s;es of wine; which as I was unaccu&s;tomed to I re&s;olutely refu&s;ed. When
<PB N="71" REF="029439_0091_0FE1119E8C2F2400">
I had &s;upped he would have me play him a tune, after which he &s;ung a &s;ong more adapt|ed to the ta&s;te of a libertine than the cha&s;te ears of a daughter. At ten o'clock I retired, and, tho' greatly &s;urprized at my father's con|duct, yet having nothing particularly heavy on my mind, I &s;oon fell a&s;leep, I never had been u&s;ed to lock my door, and you may imagine my terror when being awoke by a noi&s;e in the room, I felt a man's hand take hold of mine; I gave a faint &s;cream, fright deprived me of much power, but how were my fears increa&s;ed, when I heard my father &s;ay, "hu&s;h! don't make a noi&s;e, it is only me." "You, &s;ir," I replied, &s;tarting up, "and what can be the cau&s;e of your coming here." I cannot remember his an&s;wer, Celia, but I know he caught me in his arms. I &s;prang from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with a violent effort, and quitting the bed, the darkne&s;s of the night befriended me and I ru&s;hed out of the room into Deborah's chamber. After this I kept my apartment for &s;everal days, nor did I intend to have left it again till my mother's return, pretending indi&s;po&s;ition; but he wrote me a letter, in which he a&s;&s;erted that he had mi&s;taken my chamber for the hou&s;e|maid's, with whom he confe&s;&s;ed he had an intrigue. Oh Celia! what a humaliating con|fe&s;&s;ion from a father to a child, &s;ure none but an unprincipled rake could have brought
<PB N="72" REF="029439_0092_0FE111A2C5CE30D8">
him&s;elf to make it. He begged I would not mention the circum&s;tance to my mother, and promi&s;ed amendment in future. Alas! I was deceived by this letter and again ven|tured down to my meals. The day Deborah had leave to go out I &s;pent the chief part be|low, he was remarkably re&s;erved in his be|haviour, and &s;eemed even indifferent and inattentive to me, &s;carcely &s;peaking the whole day. At &s;upper I drank as u&s;ual one gla&s;s of wine and then retired; I felt an unaccount|able drow&s;ine&s;s come over me; but it had been a &s;torm all the evening, and the almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant fla&s;hes of lightning, with di&s;tant rumbling thunder, prevented my indulging it. I had partly undre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf and was &s;itting on the &s;ide of the bed endeavouring to compo&s;e my&s;elf, (for I am greatly terri|fied at lightning,) when the door opened, and my father entered; he immediately &s;hut the door and turned the key. To de&s;cribe my horror is impo&s;&s;ible, or to give you the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of the &s;cene that en&s;ued; but never to the late&s;t hour I have to breathe, will it be era&s;ed from my memory. My re|peated &s;creams were of no avail. Deborah was from home, and the other maids &s;lept too far off to hear me. Oh! how often did I wi&s;h that the vivid lightning, which every moment illumined the room, would &s;trike me dead. At length a mo&s;t tremendous clap

of thunder bur&s;t as it were directly over us. It ennerved, even the arm of hardened guilt, but it encouraged me. I &s;eized the oppor|tunity to fling open the window and declare, if he did not in&s;tantly quit my chamber, I would throw my&s;elf out, and &s;eeing a pen|knife lay on the window &s;eat, I &s;natched it up: "come not near me, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "for the moment you lay your hand upon me, this &s;hall put an end to your exi&s;tence." my fury which had wrought me almo&s;t to a &s;tate of frenzy, intimidated him. "Be pati|ent, Meriel," &s;aid he, "&s;hut the window and get into bed, you will catch your death with cold." "Better be dead," &s;aid I, "than live with di&s;honour." "I &s;wear," he replied, "by all that is &s;acred, if you will go quietly to bed I will quit the room immediately."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall quit it in&s;tantly," &s;aid I, in a menacing accent; "am I not your child, and do you dare invade the virtue it is your duty to protect?" Celia, I felt at that moment as tho' I could have encountered almo&s;t any thing; that I could have bared my bo&s;om to the &s;troke of death, and even met the blow with thankfulne&s;s; he &s;aw my increa&s;ing frenzy, and trembling unlocked the door and left the room. The moment he was gone I locked my&s;elf in, and over|come with horror and di&s;tre&s;s, fell almo&s;t life|le&s;s

on the bed: how long I continued in this &s;tate of torpor I cannot tell; but the fir&s;t u&s;e I made of my returning &s;en&s;es was to think of e&s;caping from the hou&s;e, and in this I was re&s;olutely determined, when I heard him again at the door demanding ad|mi&s;&s;ion: the candle was now gone out, and the window &s;till open; the thought was mo|mentary: I formed no plan for &s;upport, nor even thought of a place where to &s;eek an a&s;ylum; but, &s;tarting up, I pulled the &s;heets off the bed, and, undre&s;&s;ed as I was, &s;lipped by them into the garden. How I e&s;|caped, unhurt, heaven alone can tell: the moment I felt my&s;elf on the ground I thank|ed God for my deliverance, and going out of the back garden gate, ran as fa&s;t as my &s;trength would permit, as I imagined, to|ward a neighbouring villages but as the day began to dawn, I found I had taken a wrong road, and was at the entrance of a large wood; I was afraid to return, le&s;t I &s;hould meet my father; therefore, forcing my way into the thicke&s;t part, I found a little hovel, which had been made by &s;ome unfortunate wanderer, of branches and dry leaves: into this poor &s;helter I crept, and here fir&s;t di&s;covered that my faithful Lubin was with me. The little affectionate animal crept clo&s;e up to me, licking my hands and face, as tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wi&s;hed to comfort me; in

But here I mu&s;t drop my pen, for memory no longer bears any traces of the en&s;uing &s;cenes, till I awoke in my own bed and &s;aw Deborah weeping by my &s;ide.

<P>MY lot is hard, Celia, very hard; but I endeavour to keep up my &s;pirits, as well as I am able, and conduct my&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as my own heart may acquit me.</P>
<P>When I was quite recovered from my ill|ne&s;s, my mother called me one day into her
<PB N="76" REF="029439_0096_0FE111B774C2F158">
dre&s;&s;ing-room and a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he would par|don my elopement, on condition I would in|form her of the cau&s;e, and by what means I came in the &s;hocking &s;ituation already de|&s;cribed. You may be certain I felt my&s;elf greatly agitated, as I knew I could not give this dear parent the &s;atisfaction &s;he required, without planting a dagger in her heart. In|deed, my friend, I cannot but feel thankful, that in my frenzy I did not di&s;cover the whole horrid &s;ecret, as it would have only involv|ed us all in much greater di&s;tre&s;s than we experience at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I remained &s;ilent to my mother's que&s;tion, but could not re&s;train my tears. She repeat|ed it; conjuring me, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, not to trifle with her, but to tell her what urged me to de&s;ert my home and friends.</P>
<P>"Oh! my dear mother," &s;aid I, "do not a&s;k, indeed I cannot tell you. Suffer me to be &s;ilent on this &s;ubject; and, in every fu|ture action of my life, I will implicitly obey you." "I fear, Meriel," &s;aid my mother, "you have &s;ome unworthy rea&s;ons for this concealment: tell me, then, who advi&s;ed you to this imprudent &s;tep, and who accompanied you in your flight?" "No one," &s;aid I, "the re&s;olution was ha&s;tily formed, and as ha|&s;tily
<PB N="77" REF="029439_0097_0FE111BCC1BDADC0">
executed; but I had no advi&s;er, no com|panion, nor do I think I ever went farther than the wood, where I was di&s;covered."</P>
<P>"Meriel! Meriel!" &s;aid my mother, "I cannot believe you. It appears altogether improbable, that a young woman, without any apparent cau&s;e, &s;hould form a ha&s;ty re|&s;olution of running away; that &s;he &s;hould chu&s;e a tempe&s;tuous night to make her e&s;cape, without a companion, and hide her&s;elf in a wood with a de&s;ign to &s;tarve her&s;elf to death. Tell me, child, and tell me &s;incere|ly, did you not once love Pringle?" "I thought I did, but it was a mi&s;take of the heart."</P>
<P>"I fear, Meriel, that mi&s;take has led to your ruin: he certainly accompanied you in your flight, and my child is lo&s;t to honour and to virtue. Is not this the cau&s;e of your ob&s;tinate &s;ilence: do you not fear that the villain, whom in your heart you &s;till love, &s;hould be brought to an&s;wer for his inhu|man de&s;ertion of you."</P>
<P>"Oh! no my dear mother," &s;aid I, re|doubling my tears, "indeed you wrong me, I never entertained a thought that I &s;hould blu&s;h to own, and if it was my la&s;t moment, I could, with &s;afety to my con&s;cience, de|clare
<PB N="78" REF="029439_0098_0FE111BF6A42C578">
that neither Mr. Pringle, nor any of his family knew of my going away."</P>
<P>"Strange infatuation," &s;aid &s;he, angrily, "to a&s;&s;ert &s;uch fal&s;ehoods. Oh Meriel! I had hoped better from you; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay, in this in&s;tance, I can place no confi|dence in your veracity." Here my father entered the room, and would you believe it po&s;&s;ible, Celia, he repeated to me every que&s;|tion which my mother had a&s;ked before. A&s;to|ni&s;hment riveted my tongue. I could not an&s;wer. My &s;ilence was accounted ob&s;tina|cy, and my dear mother left me with the&s;e cruel words: "Di&s;&s;embling, ob&s;tinate girl, I can never love you as I once did, though I will &s;trive to forgive you."</P>
<P>My father &s;carcely now ever &s;peaks to me, and &s;eems in his heart to hate me, as he takes every opportunity in his power of mortifying me; con&s;trues my mo&s;t innocent actions into faults, and is continually com|plaining to my mother of my indolence, and &s;ulkine&s;s, as he inhumanely terms that want of vivacity, for which he &s;o well knows how to account. This ill humour I could bear patiently, but my mother's unkindne&s;s is wor&s;e than a dagger to my heart. I live in greater &s;olitude than ever; I never go out, and when any company comes to the family,
<PB N="79" REF="029439_0099_0FE111C5607A7FB8">
I in general retire to my own room; for my feelings are often hurt by the ignorant, I had almo&s;t &s;aid inhuman que&s;tions, that are a&s;ked me by people who have no other inte|re&s;t in my fate, than as it &s;erves to gratify their curio&s;ity. Next week I expect my bro|ther home from &s;chool; he does not return again, but is to be articled apprentice to a merchant in London. I &s;hall not be &s;orry when he is gone, for I expect to &s;uffer great|ly from his unfeeling taunts. Oh! Celia, heaven and you know how little I de&s;erve them; and that thought &s;hall be my comfort and &s;upport. Adieu my friend.</P>

<P>YOU are, no doubt &s;urprized to &s;ee from whence this letter is dated, and you will be much more &s;o, when I inform you of the great change that has taken place in our circum&s;tances, &s;ome little time after I la&s;t wrote to you, as I was &s;itting in my own room, indulging the mo&s;t painful ideas, I heard a great confu&s;ion below, and, among the re&s;t, my mother's voice repeatedly &s;creaming for help. I ran down &s;tairs into the parlour, from whence the noi&s;e proceed|ed, and on entering &s;aw two ill looking men, one of which had &s;eized my father by the collar, and the other was a&s;&s;i&s;ting to drag him away. "What is the matter," &s;aid I, to the men, "what are you doing with my father?" "Oh! we will do him no harm," &s;aid one of them: "he mu&s;t only come away with us to my hou&s;e, at Litchfield, till he has
<PB N="81" REF="029439_0101_0FE111D7A527C7A0">
paid five hundred pounds." "Five hun|dred pounds," &s;aid I, "why, dear madam," turning to my mother, "to whom does my father owe &s;o much money." "Oh child!" &s;aid he, "your mother knows nothing about the affair, I not only owe that, but three times the &s;um; we are inevitably ru|ined, and all by my own folly. I have been bound for a friend of mine, a young man, at Litchfield, who is gone off, and I &s;hall have all his debts to di&s;charge." My poor mother &s;at weeping; and, on hearing this account, lifted up her eyes in &s;peechle&s;s agony. I could not bear to &s;ee her di&s;tre&s;s. "It is a large &s;um to be &s;ure gentlemen," &s;aid I, "but it &s;hall be paid, &s;o let my father remain, and do you go away for to night; to-morrow we will &s;end you the money." Alas! Celia, how very little I knew of the world. The inhuman men laughed at me, and a&s;ked me, "when I ever heard of bailiffs letting go their pri&s;oner on the bare word of a girl." "If you will not take my word," &s;aid I, "leave my fahter and take me, for it will break my dear mother's heart to have him carried to pri&s;on; but, as to me, it matters not what becomes of me." "That won't do neither, Mi&s;s," &s;aid they, "we mu&s;t either have the money or take the gentle|man away." Alas!" &s;aid I, turning to my mother, "what can I do? they will not re|lea&s;e
<PB N="82" REF="029439_0102_0FE111DA9A666470">
him." No my child," &s;aid my mother, with more affection in her voice than I had heard for &s;ome time, "we mu&s;t &s;ubmit as patiently as we can till to-morrow, and then &s;ee what can be done. My father went away cur&s;ing his evil genius. Why will peo|ple, Celia, when they bring misfortune on their own heads, rail at fate; yet you will find it always the ca&s;e, and the more egre|grious have been their errors, the more ve|hement their compalints.</P>
<P>When they were gone, I exerted my&s;elf to con&s;ole my mother, but her only an&s;wer was, "Ah Meriel! what will become of us, I &s;ee ruin approaching; I know of no way to avoide it, and my poor boy, what will he do." "Let me intreat you my dear mo|ther," &s;aid I, "not to let this accident thus di&s;tre&s;s you: can you &s;uppo&s;e, that while I have the means of living in ea&s;e and comfort, I would &s;uffer my parent or my brother to feel any embarra&s;&s;ment, which it is in my pow|er to remove. Did I not &s;olemnly promi&s;e the dear departed &s;aint, who made me thus independant, never to for&s;ake you?"</P>
<P>"But alas! Meriel, have you not already broke that vow?" "Dear, dear madam, for|give, forget, that involuntary tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and believe me, there never was a heart that
<PB N="83" REF="029439_0103_0FE111E072E86110">
glowed with more filial love, or greatful ten|derne&s;s, than mine does towards you. My fortune is your's, I will &s;hare it with you and my brother to the la&s;t &s;hilling; nay to con|vince you of my &s;incerity, I would freely re|nounce it all, and depend on my labour for &s;upport." My mother was affected, but it was only for a moment, &s;he again a&s;&s;umed a look of coldne&s;s, and told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he feared I often &s;uffered the warmth of my imagina|tion to hurry me into expre&s;&s;ions and pro|mi&s;es, the nature of which I did not duly con&s;ider. She then bid me good night and left me.</P>
<P>Grieved to be thought &s;o very unwor|thy, by the per&s;on on earth I mo&s;t loved, mo&s;t wi&s;hed to &s;ee happy, I could take no re&s;t all night. As &s;oon as day-light appear|ed I aro&s;e, and dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf as plain as po&s;&s;ible, borrowing a black bonnet of De|borah, I determined to &s;et out for Litchfield on foot; but, fearing my mother might be alarmed at my ab&s;ence, I left a note inform|ing her, in a few words, that I was gone to endeavour to prove my&s;elf worthy of her love. During my walk I revolved in my mind what &s;teps to pur&s;ue. Mr. Sutten was joint guardian with my father: I had no doubt he had been &s;ent for on account of the arre&s;t, and hoped to prevail on him to
<PB N="84" REF="029439_0104_0FE111E431DCBD70">
advance &s;ufficient money to make my poor mother ea&s;y in her mind. I therefore deter|mined to go immediately to the hou&s;e of the bailiff, and learn at who&s;e &s;uit my father had been arre&s;ted. From thence I would go to the creditor and endeavour to prevail with him to take half the money now, and the re&s;t when I became my own mi&s;tre&s;s, which, according to Mrs. Mirvan's will, was to be at eighteen years old. Here bu&s;y reflection aro&s;e, and told me how very unworthy of my attention my father was, but he is my father &s;till, &s;aid I, and tho' he has forgotten his duty towards me, it does not follow that I am to neglect mine to him: be&s;ides, reli|gion teaches us to reward evil with good; and &s;urely, if there is any way of awakening the per&s;on who injures us, to a &s;en&s;e of their guilt, it is by &s;hewing them an example of chri&s;tian charity, and good will; be&s;ides, my mother and brother have not injured me, and why &s;hould they &s;uffer for the vices of my father? Occupied by the&s;e reflections, I entered Litchfield, and went directly to the bailiff's hou&s;e. My father was not up; in|deed I did not wi&s;h to &s;ee him if he had, &s;o I only made the nece&s;&s;ary enquiries, learnt who the creditor was, and proceeded direct|ly to the &s;treet where he lived. Mr. Lee&s;on is a man, who, for many years, &s;erved a no|bleman in London, as I have been told, tho'
<PB N="85" REF="029439_0105_0FE111E9930120A8">
in what capacity, I never heard. In his &s;er|vice, he accumulated a con&s;iderable fortune, and married a lady, a particular <HI>friend</HI> of his lord&s;hip's. Soon after he procured a pen|&s;ion, with which he came down to Litchfield, the place of his lady's birth, where he is now reckoned a very great man. This was the per&s;on who had occa&s;ioned my father's impri|&s;onment. On knocking at the door a &s;ervant appeared yawning, and examining my dre&s;s with a &s;crutinizing eye, a&s;ked what I wanted. "I wi&s;h too &s;ee Mr. Lee&s;on," &s;aid I, "on particular bu&s;ine&s;s." "Humph," &s;aid the fellow, &s;tanding with his back again&s;t the wall, his hands in his breeches pockets, "you mu&s;t wait a good while before you can &s;ee him, for he is not up yet." "Pray friend," &s;aid I, "give me leave to go in and &s;it down till your ma&s;ter does get up." "You may go down &s;tairs," &s;aid he, "if you will, and when ma&s;ter is &s;tirring, I will let you know."</P>
<P>Humiliating, as it was, I went down &s;tairs, &s;at down by the kitchen fire and dried my feet, which were wet, &s;ome rain having fal|len in the night; my petticoat was al&s;o pla&s;hed with dirt. About nine o'clock, a &s;pruce young woman, in a long white bed|gown, came into the kitchen, and looking at me with a &s;ort of contemptuous &s;neer,
<PB N="86" REF="029439_0106_0FE111ED0C7D9608">
cries, "&s;ervant ma'am, pray who may you want?" Imagining, from her appearance, and the manner in which &s;he put the que&s;|tion, that &s;he might be &s;ome relation of the family, I ro&s;e from my &s;eat, and an|&s;wered I had bu&s;ine&s;s of much importance with Mr. Lee&s;on. "Aye Mrs. Bridget," cried a footman, who was cleaning &s;ome &s;il|ver candle&s;ticks, at the dre&s;&s;er; "when my lady's bell rings, you mu&s;t let ma&s;ter know, this here young body has been waiting here ever &s;ince eight o'clock." A young la&s;s, in appearance a menial &s;ervant, now appeared, and &s;preading a fine napkin on the table, brought the breakfa&s;t things, toa&s;ted &s;ome oat cakes, and Mrs. Bridget and Mr. James &s;at very comfortably down to breakfa&s;t; but during their repa&s;t, neither a&s;ked me if I would partake, tho' they endeavoured to gratify their curio&s;ity, by a&s;king, how far I had walked, if I had been long in the country, and many other que&s;tions, equally imperti|nent and in&s;ignificant; to all which I an|&s;wered in little more than mono&s;yllables. At length the bell rang, and Mrs. Bridget making a ha&s;ty fini&s;h of her breakfa&s;t, ran up &s;tairs: &s;oon after, the footman having equip'd him&s;elf as a valet, went out of the kitchen. I was now once more le&s;t to my|&s;elf, but had not indulged reflection long, before the girl, who had prepared the break|fa&s;t,
<PB N="87" REF="029439_0107_0FE111F2F5BFE340">
came and &s;at down, in order to eat her own. She pour'd out two cups of tea, got up and held the oat cake (which was almo&s;t cold) to the &s;ire, then ca&s;ting a look, fir&s;t at me, then at the table, in a mild accent, as tho' fearful of giving offence, &s;aid, "I am afraid you have not breakfa&s;ted ma'am; pray eat a bit, and take this cup of tea," hoiding the plate and tea towards me. "Mrs. Bridget is very proud ma'am, and Mr. James does nothing but what he thinks &s;he will like; but I thinks your London folks are all proud; they &s;erves only to make places uncomfortable. Do ma'am take it; I wi&s;h it was hotter and better." "It is very good," &s;aid I, taking a bit; for the poor girl's goodne&s;s of heart was &s;o con&s;pi|cuous that I could not mortify her by a re|fu&s;al. She &s;miled, began drinking her own tea, and continued: "Mr. James was quite a different &s;ort of a body, I a&s;&s;ures you ma'am before he went to London la&s;t &s;ummer with my mi&s;tre&s;s; dear heart, he and I were &s;o comfortable and happy, but when they came home my lady brought Mrs. Bridget with her, and ever &s;ince"&mdash;She pau&s;ed; I &s;aw her eyes gli&s;ten. Poor girl, thought I, James is fal&s;e hearted, he has for&s;aken thee for Bridget; and yet, if he had but di&s;cern|ment to perceive the difference between the two hearts, how gladly would he return to
<PB N="88" REF="029439_0108_0FE111F728656670">
one &s;o gentle and tender. Here I was in|terrupted by Mr. James him&s;elf, who told me his ma&s;ter de&s;ired me to walk up. I bade the kind hearted girl good morning, and followed James into the pre&s;ence of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>"Well, young woman," &s;aid Mr. Lee|&s;on, who was &s;tanding with his back to the fire, and his hands behind him. (Celia I mu&s;t here digre&s;s to give you &s;ome &s;mall idea of his per&s;on and manner.) A per&s;on rather above the middle &s;ize, a face, the fea|tures of which, might have been termed regular, and even plea&s;ing, had benevolence, good humour or politene&s;s been any way di&s;cernable in it, in&s;tead of which there was an in&s;olent pertne&s;s, a &s;upercilious, &s;elf-ap|proving &s;mile, that to my idea portrayed nothing but ignorance, pride and conceit.</P>
<P>"Well, young woman," &s;aid he, "what may be your commands with me."</P>
<P>"You are &s;ir, I under&s;tand, the per&s;on who has cau&s;ed Mr. Howard to be arre&s;ted." He an&s;wered in the affirmative.</P>

<P>"I under&s;tood, &s;ir, that he was bound for a friend."</P>

<P>"'Pon honour, Mi&s;s," &s;aid he, "I beg pardon, I did not mean to make you unea&s;y; but when one hears &s;uch &s;trange &s;tories, one likes, you know, to come at the truth: 'pon my &s;oul I wi&s;h I had been in Pringles place, I &s;hould not have driven &s;uch a pretty little kind &s;oul to di&s;pair."</P>
<P>During this &s;peech he had drawn nearer to me and had taken one of my hands, which I drew from him with di&s;dain.

<P>I HAVE not had a moment to devote to my dear Celia &s;ince I di&s;patched the la&s;t, but as I know your friendly heart &s;hares all the &s;ufferings of your Meriel, I will now con|tinue my narrative.</P>
<P>When Mr. Sutten appeared, he was great|ly &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me at Litchfield, and when I told him of my vi&s;it to Mr. Lee&s;on, he ap|peared very angry and &s;aid, "with his good will, I &s;hould not pay a farthing, and at any rate I &s;hould not have the money, till I was of age; for I might, if I attempted to extri|cate my father from his pre&s;ent difficulites, &s;oon be reduced to beggary, and leave my|&s;elf without the power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting my mo|ther; who was far more de&s;erving my af|fection and duty."</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="029439_0114_0FE112090C230670">
"It is on her account, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "that I am thus anxious. Her happine&s;s is bound up with my father's, and while he is under confinement &s;he will be mi&s;erable; be&s;ides, Mr. Sutten, &s;he does not think I love her, does not think me capable of doing a wor|thy action. Oh! &s;ir, give me the power to convince her, that my own intere&s;t and hap|pine&s;s is of little value when put in compe|tition with her's."</P>
<P>"My dear mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid he, "you mu&s;t confe&s;s appearances have been &s;trange|ly again&s;t you. I will acknowledge I my&s;elf have had my doubts concerning the recti|tude of your heart."</P>
<P>"Oh! I know," &s;aid I, "there is a fatal my&s;tery involves my conduct, a my&s;tery which I never can reveal."</P>
<P>"Nor will I de&s;ire it," replied the humane Mr. Sutten, "I &s;ee at this moment &s;uch traits of genuine goodne&s;s, &s;uch proofs of a mind, impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of its du|ty, that I &s;hall always think you had &s;ome ve|ry ju&s;t cau&s;e for your pa&s;t conduct, nor will I believe it po&s;&s;ible for a heart capable of con|ceiving &s;uch noble, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, to harbour inclinations derogatory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the honour and dignity of a virtuous woman."</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="029439_0115_0FE1120E32EFEAC0">
I thanked him for his good opinion, and he proceeded: "You mu&s;t con&s;ider, Mi&s;s Howard, that you are young, very young; you know but little of the world, of con&s;e|quence can form no ju&s;t value of that inde|pendence, which, believe me, can alone &s;ecure you friends. Beauty and merit, my dear girl, are oftener a prejudice than a benefit to the po&s;e&s;&s;ors; it is an object of envy to your own &s;ex; and, &s;orry I am to add, in general excites no other ideas in the bo&s;om of ours, than to lead them to endeavour to vitiate tho&s;e principles they pretend to adore; let me in|treat you, therefore, to &s;et a ju&s;t value on that independence, with which it has plea&s;ed heaven to ble&s;s you; a&s;&s;i&s;t your parents as far as you can, without hurting your&s;elf, and remember, that to &s;ecure the friend&s;hip of others you mu&s;t not need their a&s;&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>This, my dear Celia, was arguing like a cold philo&s;opher, and a man of the world; but it was not &s;peaking with the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, or with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a heart that glows with benevolence to all its fellow creatures. The dear le&s;&s;ons which I imbibed at Bologne taught me to regard my|&s;elf but in a &s;econdary light, when any thing prai&s;e-worthy was to be performed, and to remember only the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> us to do as we would be done by

and, like the good Samaritan to pour oil and wine into the wounds of our &s;uffering fel|low creatures; but to proceed:</P>
<P>Mr. Sutten refu&s;ed to advance a &s;hilling, and I was forced to return to my mother, di&s;appointed, dejected, and weary.</P>
<P>Two days after, an execution was &s;ent to Woodbine Cot; my poor mother and my|&s;elf were obliged to remove to Litchfield, where we took a &s;mall lodging near the hou&s;e where my father was, where we remained till the e&s;tate was &s;old and all paid away to the la&s;t farthing, nor was even that enough to an&s;wer all the demands that were continually pouring in from all quarters; be&s;ides, when the e&s;tate came to be &s;old, it was found &s;o en|cumbered with mortgages, &amp;c. that it would not &s;ell for above half its value. When all was &s;ettled, and my father at liberty, it was de|termined that we &s;hould &s;et forward to Lon|don, where my father in&s;i&s;ted we could live much cheaper than in the country, where we were &s;o well known. There was &s;till the intere&s;t of my four thou&s;and pounds, which as it was at my own di&s;po&s;al, I deter|mined to devote to the &s;upport of the family. All our &s;ervants were di&s;charged, poor De|borah too; you cannot think, Celia, what I &s;uffered on being &s;eparated from this faith|ful

woman. She offered to &s;tay with us without being paid; but my mother would not con&s;ent to reeicve an obligation from an inferior. I thought the re&s;olution &s;avoured of pride; but we all have our failings, and perhaps pride in &s;ome degree, is laudable.</P>
<P>On our arrival in town, we took a &s;mall lodging and hired a young woman to do the mo&s;t laborious part of our dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s; the re&s;t' it is my province to perform; and, believe me, I do it chearfully. It employs my mind, prevents my taking melancholy retro&s;pects, and I think contributes to im|prove both my health and &s;pirits. We have paid a vi&s;it to my father's elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter. She is married to a coun&s;ellor, who has made a genteel independence by his profe&s;&s;ion. My aunt is a woman who&s;e character I do not well know how to develope. She is in ge|neral affable, conde&s;cending, and chearful; and in conver&s;ation, gives evident proofs of a genteel education, and a brilliant under|&s;tanding; but, with all is &s;o tinctured with va|nity, and tho' upwards of forty, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es that &s;pirit of coquetry, that in a great mea|&s;ure ob&s;cures her good qualities. Her daugh|ters, He&s;ter and Su&s;an, have had, what is termed a fa&s;hionable education, that is, they can daub a fan mount, jumble the keys of the harp&s;ichord, and jabber an unintelligible
<PB N="98" REF="029439_0118_0FE1121CBB87E610">
jargon, which they call French. They are realy lovely girls. He&s;ter, in particular, &s;eems calculated to in&s;pire love and re&s;pect, wherever &s;he appears. Su&s;an is more vola|tile, but, with all can make her&s;elf extremely agreeable. They are both &s;poilt by the mo|ther, who, having taken it into her head, that their beauty will certainly recommend them to men of rank and fortune, is conti|nually filling the poor girls' minds with that kind of vanity, and eager de&s;ire of con|que&s;t, that in general fails of the de&s;ired effect, and repels the admiration, which it is de&s;igned to attract. Their naturally good di&s;po&s;itions are by the&s;e means totally pre|verted, and in&s;tead of being the engaging, innoecnt, unaffected girls, which nature form'd them, they appear, in a mixed com|pany, a combination of pride, vanity, and &s;elf-conceit.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;op, their father, is haughty, di&s;|tant, and forbidding in his manner, po&s;e&s;&s;es a great deal, of what is called family pride: has little feeling and le&s;s good nature, yet on the whole is deemed a re&s;pectable cha|racter. He is &s;trictly hone&s;t in his princi|ples, pays every one their due to the utmo&s;t farthing, but will not be&s;tow the lea&s;t trifle in charity, becau&s;e he con&s;iders con&s;tantly paying the poor rate to be a &s;ufficient di&s;|charge
<PB N="99" REF="029439_0119_0FE112221A2F4EE0">
of that duty. The query with me, is, whether he would pay that &s;um yearly if not obliged to it; if not, where is the merit of paying it now. Oh! Celia, how do I hate tho&s;e luke-warm hearts. You may remember I always &s;hewed a di&s;like to the cool doctrines of philo&s;ophy. I could never have a good opinion of a per&s;on who regards every &s;urrounding object with the &s;toical eye of apathy. I am &s;ure they mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s hearts, rendered impenetrable by na|ture to tho&s;e fine feelings, which, tho' at &s;ome moments they may di&s;tre&s;s, in general ele|vate and expand the &s;oul. For my own part, Celia, I am as weak as an infant, whenever a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s or happine&s;s meets my eye, I have a tear of &s;ympathy for the one, and a &s;mile of gratulation for the other; and the &s;mile and the tear, mingle &s;o &s;weetly with each other, that every faculty is harmonized by the union, and I am at a lo&s;s to tell which &s;en&s;ation is the mo&s;t exqui&s;itely delightful. Then let the unfeeling boa&s;t the philo&s;ophic calmne&s;s of their tempers. I will not &s;cru|ple to aver, that tho' they may e&s;cape many an acute pang, that wrings the heart of &s;en&s;i|bility, they know not what true plea&s;ure is. But I am &s;trangely digre&s;&s;ing from my &s;ub|ject. You will wonder perhaps, how I &s;o &s;oon comprehended the character of my un|cle's family: believe me, Celia, it was not
<PB N="100" REF="029439_0120_0FE11226493C2E78">
by my own penetration that I di&s;covered them. From my own ob&s;ervations, I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. Mo&s;&s;op an agreeable man, his wife a charming, amiable woman, and the two young ladies the &s;weete&s;t, mo&s;t en|gaging girls in the world; nay, at this very moment, I feel &s;o inclined to love the whole family, that I think the di&s;agreeable traits in their characters have been exaggerated. It was to a Mr. Rainsforth, that I was indebted for this minute delineation of them. This Mr. Rainsforth is an agreeable young man, whom I have frequently &s;een at my uncle's, and at fir&s;t thought he was partial to my cou&s;in He&s;ter, but I find I was mi&s;taken in this &s;uppo&s;ition, as his intimacy in the family proceeds from his having been &s;chool-fellow with young Mo&s;&s;op, whom I have as yet &s;een but little of.</P>
<P>Rainsforth is the &s;on of a merchant, in Plymouth. His mother died when he was an infant, and his father has, within the&s;e few years, married a woman many years younger than him&s;elf, by whom he has a young family. Frederic has a &s;mall fortune independent of his father, and is be&s;ides a lieutenant in the navy. My father &s;eems very partial to him; that, you will &s;ay, is no great recommendation; but I flatter my|&s;elf, Celia, this unhappy father begins to &s;ee
<PB N="101" REF="029439_0121_0FE1122BF0328040">
his errors, and will, in future atone for them. I think, tho' our income is circum&s;cribed, and our &s;ituation greatly altered, my dear mother is much happier than I ever &s;aw her. I cannot boa&s;t of much happine&s;s my&s;elf; re|membrance, painful rembrance, damps every little plea&s;ure or amu&s;ement that is offered to my notice; yet, when I look round me, and behold many who are perhaps my &s;upe|riors in worth and virtue, peri&s;hing for want of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life; oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;ickne&s;s; &s;urrounded with children, who look up to them for that &s;upport, which they have not to be&s;tow: when I &s;ee the&s;e things, my friend, I lift up my heart in hum|ble gratitude to that Providence, who has, thro' life, given a portion into my hand, the over plus of which may, in &s;ome little degree, &s;erve to cheer the &s;ons and daughters of mi|&s;ery. You &s;mile to hear me talk of having any to &s;pare from my little income. Oh! my dear girl, had I but a &s;hilling in my poc|ket, I could not call it my own, if I &s;aw a fellow creature who&s;e heart would be in the lea&s;t lightened by &s;haring it with me.</P>
<P>My aunt has promi&s;ed to take me to a play. I am fond reading dramatic works, and form great expectations of amu&s;ement from &s;eeing a performance. I will certainly give you
<PB N="102" REF="029439_0122_0FE1123144C442B8">

<P>I NEVER &s;hall get u&s;ed to the ways of London, and I am always bringing my|&s;elf into difficulties, and fooli&s;h embarra&s;|ments, through my ignorance; then my mother is angry, and what in reality pro|ceeds from &s;implicity of my nature, is con|&s;trued into art or levity.</P>
<P>I have been fretting the&s;e two hours about a circum&s;tance that has highly of|fended

my dear mother; and, I am &s;ure, Celia, I did it without a thought of harm. I had been out a little way ye&s;terday, and was returning in the clo&s;e of the evening, when I heard a very genteel looking elderly gentleman enquiring the way to a &s;treet which lay in my way home; the per&s;on whom he addre&s;&s;ed could not direct him, and I, uncon&s;cious of any impropriety, &s;tep|ped forward and told him, as it lay in my way, I would &s;hew him the place he enquir|ed for: he &s;eemed much obliged to me, and &s;aid, "as we were going the &s;ame way I might as well take hold of his arm;" but this, as he was quite a &s;tranger, I refu&s;ed to do; however, I could not help an&s;wering &s;ome civil que&s;tions, which he a&s;ked, and when we arrived at the &s;treet he had men|tioned, he in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing me &s;afe home: this I remon&s;trated again&s;t, &s;aying, be|&s;ides giving him unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, it would make my mother very angry with me. At this he declared he knew my mo|ther very well, and he was not at all afraid of her anger, as he was certain it lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his power to appea&s;e it. I was &s;urpri&s;ed, you may imagine, and indeed very unea&s;y all the re&s;t of the way, as I knew how offended my mother would be, at &s;eeing a &s;tranger come home with me. When the &s;ervant opened the door he walked in without any
<PB N="104" REF="029439_0124_0FE111CE791BEF20">
ceremony, and going into the parlour which was occupied by the gentlewoman who keeps the hou&s;e, he thus addre&s;&s;ed her, "Servant, my good madam, your lovely daughter here, having kindly given me an invitation home, I flatter my&s;elf we &s;hall &s;pend a chearful evening, and you and I, my good mother, &s;hall not di&s;agree, I war|rant." Mrs. Fermor &s;tared, and I felt rea|dy to fink into the earth.</P>
<P>"You are under a mi&s;take, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "pray leave me." "What, leave you, my little dove, when you have been &s;o very kind, no, no! hardly &s;uch a fool as that; come mother, what &s;hall I order in for &s;up|per, and what wine will you drink?" "Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid Mrs. Fermor, "I am over|whelmed with a&s;toni&s;hment; how have you dared to bring this gentleman here to in|&s;ult me?" "Indeed madam," I replied, ter|rified beyond mea&s;ure, "I am innocent of any intention to offend you; this gentle|man"&mdash;"Why, I can tell the tale as well as you my pretty one," &s;aid he, interrupt|ing me: "you mu&s;t know, madam, I was coming into We&s;tmin&s;ter, and did not right|ly know my way, &s;o, this pretty, kind heart|ed dam&s;el was &s;o good as to &s;hew me, that is all, ma'am and &s;o in return, I am only grateful, and would willingly treat you with
<PB N="105" REF="029439_0125_0FE1124093E4D5A0">
good &s;upper, and as far as ten guineas would go."</P>
<P>At this moment my father came in, and &s;eeing me &s;tand trembling in the parlour, a fre&s;h &s;cene of confu&s;ion in&s;ued, which ended in the whole family believing I had invited the old gentleman home with me, merely out of levity, and as Mrs. Fermor called it, an indi&s;creet frolic. You may &s;uppo&s;e how rigorous my mother was, how angry my fa|ther; for tho' in his heart, he has not the lea&s;t regard for real virtue he always pre|tends great attention to my conduct, and this evening declared he would rather follow me to the grave than &s;ee me lo&s;t to honour.</P>
<P>Oh! Celia, how my &s;oul dete&s;ts his hy|pocri&s;y. It gives me great unea&s;ine&s;s to find ju&s;t as my mother began to have a better opinion of me, I have again lo&s;t her confi|dence; am again abridged of my walks, and at home &s;ee only the frown of di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;it on that face which once beamed on me the &s;mile of maternal tenderne&s;s.</P>

<P>My aunt has ju&s;t called, and after a great deal of per&s;ua&s;ion, has prevailed with my mother to let me go to the play to-morrow evening; I am to go out this afternoon with my cou&s;ins, to purcha&s;e &s;ome few articles of dre&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to my appearing at a public place, as my aunt always takes my cou&s;ins to the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the theatre. Well, it will be of little con&s;equence to me, where we &s;it; I go to &s;ee and not to be &s;een, I wi&s;h to be amu&s;ed my&s;elf, but have not the lea&s;t ambition to be the amu&s;ement of others, either from my per&s;on, dre&s;s or manner.</P>
<P>Well, Celia, had I ever been vain of my per&s;on, I &s;hould now be perfectly cured of &s;o ridiculous a vanity; but it is happy for me, that I never thought my face more than pa&s;&s;able; and as to my &s;hape, I knew it had not the &s;malle&s;t pretentions to either grace or elegance; and, by having this humble opinion, I have e&s;caped a &s;evere mortifica|tion;

I am a&s;toni&s;hed how young men can &s;uffer them&s;elves to be dragged as it were to &s;uch places, and have the patience to li&s;ten to a tedious de&s;erta|tion on gauzes, ribbons, lace and a hundred other trifles, almo&s;t below the notice of a ra|tional being. But, if I was &s;urpri&s;ed at that, how much more was I to &s;ee a parcel of powdered effeminate animals, for I will not call them men, &s;tuck up behind a counter, mea&s;uring a peny-worth of tape or a &s;maller quantity perhaps; telling you with the gra|vity of a philo&s;opher, that &s;uch a ribond become your delicate complexion; &s;uch a cap &s;et off your features to advantage, &amp;c. And, will you believe it po&s;&s;ible, that one morning being in a perfumer's &s;hop, I &s;aw an officer in the army, purcha&s;ing chicken gloves, violet powder and cold cream, aye, and for his own u&s;e too, for the ma&s;ter in|formed me he had neither wife nor &s;i&s;ter, to whom &s;uch things might have been of u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="029439_0128_0FE1124F0F6CA390">
Well, to the milliner's we went, where He&s;ter and Su&s;an having cho&s;en their caps. I was plea&s;ed with the choice of the fomer, and &s;aid I would have one like it. "Lord, my dear," &s;aid my aunt, "how can you think of &s;uch a thing, pretty women you know may wear any thing, but tho&s;e that are plain &s;hould &s;tudy what will mo&s;t be|come them." "Aye," cried young Mo&s;|&s;op, "my cou&s;in to be &s;ure &s;hould not wear any thing that atrtacts general notice." "Here," &s;aid Su&s;an, "here Meriel, is a ve|ry pretty cap, I think it will become you va&s;tly." It was etremely plain, having no ornament but a knott of white &s;attin ribbon.</P>
<P>"You are quite right, cou&s;in," &s;aid I, "this cap will certainly &s;uit me be&s;t. I never love to be fine, and what will be becoming on you, will only appear an af|fectation of finery on me." I &s;aid this with a &s;mile, as I tried on the cap. Mr. Rain&s;|forth told my aunt he thought true beauty required few ornaments. "Come, come, you rally," &s;aid &s;he, "you can't think Me|riel hand&s;ome." He made no an&s;wer, but &s;miling, &s;ung the following &s;tanza, which, as it contained a delicate compliment, you will pardon me if I here repeat it.</P>

<P>But, my Celia will &s;ay my letters begin to be very in&s;ipid, when I can find no other theme than the repetition of my own prai&s;e. Forgive me, dear girl, this time, I will be careful how I offend again.</P>

<P>My entertainment la&s;t night, exceeded my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations; the hou&s;e, the lights, the brilliant and numerous audi|ence, on my fir&s;t entrance, filled me with &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment; but my cou&s;ins declare they never will go to the play with me again, for at the pathetic and intere&s;ting parts, I could not conceal my emotion. It was Jane Shore. Long did I &s;truggle to &s;uppre&s;s my tears; the effort was vain, and when in the la&s;t &s;cene, they drag the ju&s;t reconciled hu&s;band from the arms of his dying wife, the half &s;mothered &s;obs bur&s;t forth, and I fell back in an hy&s;teric. You cannot think, how I was laughed at, and my cou&s;ins declare they were &s;o &s;hocked at my behaviour, that they &s;hall be a&s;hamed to &s;hew their faces at the play|hou&s;e again this &s;ea&s;on. "One would think
<PB N="110" REF="029439_0130_0FE1125A5EB57B10">
child," &s;aid my aunt, in a peevi&s;h tone, as I began to recover, "you never had &s;een a play in your life before." "Well, you know I never did," &s;aid I, aloud. This compleat|ed my di&s;grace, and my aunt turning toward the &s;tage, noticed me no more the whole evening.</P>
<P>I think if I were to go again, I &s;hould like to &s;it in &s;ome unnoticed corner, where I could give &s;en&s;ibility the reins, and whil&s;t I wept the woes of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;orrows now re&s;t in the &s;ilent grave, I would &s;o mould my heart, as it &s;hould be ever ready to par|take and alleviate the afflictions of tho&s;e who &s;till move on the bu&s;y &s;tage of life.</P>
<P>One thing, my cou&s;ins informed me of, which con&s;iderably damped my plea&s;ure during the evening. They &s;aid, that many of the beautiful, elegant women, whom I &s;aw in the boxes, were the &s;laves of vice, and purcha&s;ed the gaudy trappings, by which they were adorned, by the wages of guilt; and that (but I can hardly think it po&s;&s;ible) &s;ome of them are &s;o lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of vir|tue, that they come to tho&s;e public places with no other view than to attract new lovers; and what is &s;till wor&s;e, that in a few years; nay, perhaps even in a few months, I may &s;ee tho&s;e lovely blooming women walking the &s;treets,

&s;ubject to the in&s;ults of every brutal pa&s;&s;enger, and &s;inking into an untimely grave, under the complicated evils of poverty, &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;grace. I felt my eyes fill as He&s;ter con|cluded; and do you not pity them, &s;aid I: "La! cou&s;in," &s;aid &s;he, "you are the &s;trang|e&s;t girl; you make one laugh to &s;ee you now, with that long di&s;mal face, talking about pity for &s;uch wretches." "Perhaps," &s;aid I, "they had no friend to teach them better, and &s;urely, tho' we may &s;hudder with dete&s;tation at their vices, humanity &s;till leads us to pity their &s;ufferings." "You are as old fa&s;hioned in your notions, Meriel," &s;aid my aunt, who had overheard as, "as you are in your dre&s;s and manner. You will know better child when you have &s;een a lit|tle more of the world." I mu&s;t now quit my pen to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s. Believe me, Celia, there is no plea&s;ure &s;o agreeable as writing to you.</P>

<P>LAST night, having &s;pent the evening with my father and mother, at my un|cle's; when we were coming home Mr. Rains|forth put a letter into my hand as he handed me into the coach: I could not well return it or I would, &s;o was obliged to put it in my pocket; however, I re&s;olved not to open it till I had fir&s;t &s;hewn it to my mother. When we got home, it was late, and all immediate|ly retired to bed. I will confe&s;s it co&s;t me no little trouble to &s;tiflle the curio&s;ity that prompted me to open the letter. I put it in a drawer and turned the key; but, ju&s;t then recollecting that I wanted &s;omething that was in that identical drawer, I unlocked it again, took up the letter, read the addre&s;s, looked attentively if the wafer was dry; and after viewing it on every &s;ide near a dozen times,
<PB N="113" REF="029439_0133_0FE1126AE997D3C0">
re&s;olution at length repelled curio&s;ity, I re|turned it to the drawer and locked it again, without once recollecting why I had opened it the &s;econd time.</P>
<P>In the morning I waited till we had done breakfa&s;t, and then putting the letter into my mother's hand, &s;aid, "I hope, my dear ma|dam, this will convince you I would not wil|lingly be guilty of an impropriety, or have a concealment of this nature from my be&s;t friend." She took it with a cold look of &s;u&s;|picion, and having read it, &s;aid "I &s;uppo&s;e you know the contents." "Indeed I do not," was the reply. "You can gue&s;s, I imagine," &s;aid &s;he; "no gentleman would have had the temerity to put a letter into a young la|dy's hand in &s;uch a clande&s;tine manner, had he not been pretty certain that it would not be refu&s;ed." "Good heavens!" &s;aid I, bur&s;ting into tears, "&s;hall I never regain your confidence? Mu&s;t every action, howe|ver innocent, be mi&s;con&s;trued or liable to &s;u&s;picion." "Why Meriel," &s;aid &s;he, "will you endeavour to per&s;uade me, Mr. Rains|forth has never entertained you on the &s;ub|ject of love." "If I may be believed ma|dam," &s;aid I, with a firm voice, "he never uttered a &s;yllable to me that could be con|&s;trued into more than common politene&s;s." "Well, child, read the letter then, and tell
<PB N="114" REF="029439_0134_0FE1126F063EC910">
me your opinion of the contents." I fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> my face glow as I ca&s;t my eye over the letter, which contained a profe&s;&s;ion of ardent affec|tion and an offer of his hand, if my father approved the union.</P>
<P>"You a&s;k my opinion, dear mother," &s;aid I, "and I will candidly give it; I think Mr. Rainsforth a very amiable young man, from what little I have &s;een, but it is impo&s;|&s;ible that I can form any ju&s;t idea of his cha|racter, from &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance; If when upon a greater intimacy, I &s;hould find him in reality po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e valuable qualifications, honour and benevolence, and my father and your&s;elf have no objection, I will not he&s;itate to confe&s;s, I could give him my hand, not only without reluctance, but with plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"But &s;uppo&s;e, Meriel, your father &s;hould object." "If you, madam, &s;hould al&s;o di&s;|approve, I hope I know my duty too well to complain; &s;ince your knowledge of man|kind in general, mu&s;t make you a much better judge of what will be really conducive to my happine&s;s, than I can po&s;&s;ibly be my&s;elf; however, madam, if &s;uch objections &s;hould ari&s;e, I hope you will inform me &s;oon, that I may early begin to teach my heart a le&s;&s;on which, &s;ome little time hence, I may find a

difficulty in making it obey." My mother made no an&s;wer, and &s;oon after I left the room; in the afternoon Mr. Rainsforth cal|led; I felt the colour flu&s;h to my face: when he entered he glanced his eyes toward me; but I believe they brought him no intelli|gence concerning the reception his letter had met with. He had not been &s;eated above ten minutes before my mother made &s;ome excu&s;e to &s;end me out of the room; I under&s;tood her perfectly, and was not in ha&s;te to return; in about an hour I was &s;ent for to make tea, but it was the mo&s;t un&s;ocial meal I had ever partaken of, when Rains|forth was pre&s;ent: he was &s;ilent; I was embarra&s;&s;ed, and my father and mother, as is in general the ca&s;e, &s;poke to each other but little. When tea was over he took his leave, when my father acquainted me I had his permi&s;&s;ion to recieve his addre&s;&s;es; &s;aid he believed him a man of honour, and, if his friends rai&s;ed no objection to the union, he thought the &s;ooner it was compleated the better. Does not this eagerne&s;s to di&s;po&s;e of me, &s;hew how painful my pre&s;ence is to him? Indeed I do not wonder at it, we &s;el|dom like to be much in company with tho&s;e per&s;ons whom we are con&s;cious of having injured.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="029439_0136_0FE11278702FC120">
And now, my dear Celia, you will per|haps wonder at my &s;o readily li&s;tening to an offer of marriage from a man with whom I have &s;o &s;mall an acquaintance, but indeed my &s;ituation at home is far from being agree|able. My mother's affections &s;eem totally alienated from me, and lavi&s;hed with redoub|led tenderne&s;s on my brother, who, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, repays it with ingratitude and di&s;re|&s;pect. He is continually teizing her for money, and tho' he is con&s;cious there is no &s;ource from whence that money can pro|ceed, except from me, yet he is continually tormenting me by &s;ome ill natured trick or other. If we are in a mixed company, every word I utter is turned into ridicule. If I &s;it &s;ilent, then &s;i&s;ter is &s;tudying &s;omething cle|ver to &s;ay; if I deliver my &s;entiments on any &s;ubject that excites my &s;en&s;ibility or venera|tion, then &s;i&s;ter is going to turn a &s;entimen|tal actre&s;s, or a methodi&s;t preacher; even the re&s;pect I pay to my religious duties is an object of ridicule, in which my pretty cou&s;ins always join. If I expre&s;s my di&s;like of cards, gadding, and its attendant &s;candal, and my love of retirement, &s;tudy and dome&s;tic em|ployment, then he wonders what Mrs. Mir|van could mean by leaving me a fortune, who could be &s;o well content with
<Q><PB N="117" REF="029439_0137_0FE1127E12D34278">
<L>&mdash; pounds three-&s;core,</L>
<L>For meat and books, nor a&s;k for more.</L></Q>
To which my aunt often replies, aye, Meriel would make an excellent poor man's wife; and the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions often e&s;cape them be|fore people, who think it degrading to be able to perform, for them&s;elves, any of the nece&s;&s;ary offices of life; and would blu&s;h to death were they &s;uppo&s;ed to know how to make or mend their own linen; for my own part, I cannot help thinking, if tho&s;e fine ladies had a little more u&s;eful employ|ment on their hands, they would not have &s;o much time to inve&s;tigate and expo&s;e the actions of their neighbours.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t imagine, my dear girl, that I lead but an uncomfortable kind of life; and Mr. Rainsforth always &s;hews that attention to me, and takes my part, with &s;uch delicacy as mu&s;t unavoidably awaken my gratitude, if not my affection; and believe me I now begin to feel the difference between a real attachment and the illu&s;ive wanderings of the heart. I know how to value the virtues of my lover, at the &s;ame time I feel a much &s;tronger inclination to act in all things with that propriety as may render me re&s;pected. I feel now the true value of reputation, ho|nour and virtue, becau&s;e I entertain a hope of
<PB N="118" REF="029439_0138_0FE11281642AB290">
being one day united to a man, who&s;e charac|ter would be injured by my want of either: and, oh! my Celia, what a blu&s;h of confu&s;ion often &s;preads my cheeks, when I reflect on the letters I wrote to Pringle; how do I &s;hudder at the bare po&s;&s;ibility of tho&s;e letters one day coming to the eye of Mr. Rainsforth. Wrote, as they were, at a time when my imagination was &s;o &s;trongly tinctured with the &s;tyle of the books I had been reading, that I almo&s;t involuntarily wrote the very &s;entiments which I had ju&s;t embibed, with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of romantic affection. Ah! Celia, tho&s;e books drew very deceitful pictures of human life, their fal&s;e colouring had rai&s;ed my expectations and exalted my ideas, of love and friend&s;hip, far above any thing I can find in the little circle ac|quaintance I have formed. Perhaps tho&s;e elevated &s;entiments and actions may be con|fined to people of an elevated &s;phere of life, for I never remember meeting with any hero or heroine of a &s;tory, but either were at fir&s;t, or afterwards proved to be per&s;ons of rank and fortune: but tho&s;e are people &s;o far above me, I can never hope to form any acquaintance with them. I &s;ee them daily pa&s;s me in their carriages, &s;urrounded with af|fluence, attended with re&s;pect; yet &s;urely if I know my own heart, I do not envy them, except, when I think of the power they po&s;|&s;e&s;s
<PB N="119" REF="029439_0139_0FE112876B5AADB8">
to cheer the poor wretch humbled by affliction, and to cau&s;e the broken heart to rejoice. Envy, did I &s;ay, oh! no, it is not envy, it is a &s;entiment I cannot find a name for, it is a wi&s;h to enjoy tho&s;e tran&s;porting feelings my&s;elf, without taking from their felicity; it is an earne&s;t de&s;ire to promote, not decrea&s;e, the happine&s;s of every human being.</P>
<P>You, my Celia, &s;ecluded from the world, in devout retirement, can form but a faint idea of the many mi&s;eries with which this variegated world abounds. Yes, my friend, and there are plea&s;ures too, but they are not in general &s;uited to my ta&s;te. I hate a crowd; it may for a moment dazzle the &s;en&s;es, but it leaves no impre&s;&s;ion on the heart. In my opinion, we cannot experience real plea&s;ure, if we are devoid of happine&s;s; and of this I am certain, happine&s;s can &s;eldom be drawn from external objects, but is &s;ure to dwell in the heart, con&s;cious of performing its duty. That &s;uch happine&s;s, may ever be your's and mine, prays your</P>

<P>SINCE my la&s;t, few incidents have hap|pened, worthy the notice of my Celia, except that Mr. Rainsforth, being my de|clared lover, has a&s;toni&s;hed all my uncle's family. My mother &s;ays &s;he is &s;ure He&s;ter and Su&s;an are ready to bur&s;t with envy; I cannot think it.

My cou&s;ins &s;eem highly delighted with the idea of an approaching wedding, and declare they will be my bride maids. They are mi&s;taken in thinking the wedding will be &s;o &s;oon, Mr. Rainsforth be|ing obliged to join his &s;hip, which belongs to the grand &s;leet at Spithead, and I rather wi&s;h to remain &s;ingle till this &s;ummer's crui&s;e

is pa&s;t. If he returns &s;afe, I need not tell you with what joy I &s;hall fulfill my engagements: if not; if it be his fate to fall in the defence of his country, I will come to you my be|loved Celia, and become a pen&s;ioner in the convent for life. My religion will not per|mit me to take the veil; but my vow of celibacy will be as &s;incere, breathed from my own heart to the great Judge of all our actions, as tho' I made at the foot of the al|tar, &s;urrounded by all the pomp of monki&s;h &s;uper&s;tition. Pardon me, my beloved friend, I mean no reflection on the religion you pro|fe&s;s. I think that it is not the form but the heart that is an acceptable &s;acrifice: and the &s;oul that humbles it&s;elf before its Maker, and cries "pardon my numerous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, I am but a worm before thee, the creature of thy infinite power: if thou &s;houlde&s;t for|&s;ake me, who will dare to be my friend; di&s;|po&s;e of me as in thy wi&s;dom thou &s;halt think fit; I will not complain, but will take the lot appointed, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion." That &s;oul, my Celia, let its form of wor&s;hip be what it may, will one day &s;hine re&s;plendent in the man&s;ion of its Creator. Oh! with what rapture can we approach the throne of mercy, when with a heart overflowing with gratitude, we can &s;ay, in the words of our admired Pope:

But I know my Celia is as void of bigotry as &s;he is of every other error.</P>
<P>As Mr. Rainsforth is now, I will not deny, the fir&s;t object of my e&s;teem, I mu&s;t inform you of the rea&s;ons which have by degrees con&s;pired to rai&s;e him thus in my opinion.

<PB N="126" REF="029439_0146_0FE112A4A239B030">
but which, I think it highly proper, you &s;hould be informed of.</P>
<P>It is in general reported that I have four thou&s;and pounds for my fortune. This re|port is fal&s;e. I have only a fourth part of the &s;um. My godmother, Mrs. Mirvan, made the will in my favour, but with the&s;e re&s;trictions; that I &s;hould never &s;uffer my fa|mily to feel the nece&s;&s;ities of life. At that time, Mr. Rainsforth, there was no pro&s;pect of their ever being reduced from a &s;tate of competency, to a dependence on their child; but &s;uch is the fluctuating &s;tate of human affairs, that this is exactly now the ca&s;e. This &s;tate of depedence is extremely painful to me, and I am &s;ure mu&s;t be &s;o to them. It is, therefore, my fixed determination, when I am of age, to &s;ettle the moiety of my for|tune on my mother. I am under engage|ments for my father at pre&s;ent to the amount of five hundred pounds, and the other five hundred mu&s;t be appropriated to the u&s;e of my brother, during his clerk&s;hip, and to help him forward a little when that is ex|pired.</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition of my little fortune, may make a material difference in your plans of life for the future, and I thought it but right to inform you, that no intere&s;t of my

own, &s;hall ever induce me to alter my re&s;o|lution. If you think me &s;till worthy of your attentions, I am your's. Do not &s;mile at my frankne&s;s, I have not yet learnt to di&s;gui&s;e the feelings of my heart. Do not he&s;itate to give a candid an&s;wer. If the union is not equally eligible with one, as it would have been with four thou&s;and pounds, &s;eek not to excu&s;e your&s;elf for withdrawing your addre&s;&s;es, I will not even require an apology for a conduct, to which I am certain, no|thing but the mo&s;t powerful rea&s;ons, could have forced you.</P>

<P>SHALL I not chide you, my dear Mi&s;s Howard; &s;hall I not tell you what I felt at the reception of your dear unkind let|ter. Dear it will ever be to my fond bo&s;om, becau&s;e in the &s;incerity of your language, I could read the affection of your heart. "Smile at your frankne&s;s;" how could you think of &s;uch a thing.

<P>I am every day expecting orders to join the fleet. Will you, my dear Mi&s;s Howard, par|don my impatience, if I wi&s;h to call you mine before the&s;e orders arrive. I &s;hall have a thou&s;and doubts and fears if I leave you be|fore we are irrevocably united.

For you alone would I fight, for your &s;ake alone wi&s;h to conquer, and your love &s;hould be the reward of all my toils.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.)</HEAD>
<P>BUT I did refu&s;e him, Celia, tho' my little rebellious heart would have fain played the traitor. Be &s;till little fool, &s;aid I, Meriel will learn to be thy mi&s;tre&s;s: think not, by thy flutterings and throbings, to counteract re&s;olutions which rea&s;on tells me are right and laudable. So, my dear girl, I per&s;evered in the determination of not giv|ing Rainsforth my hand, till the &s;ummer's crui&s;e was over, and he was obliged to &s;ub|mit with as good a grace as he could, tho' I a&s;&s;ure you, he looked quite blank upon it. And now, my dear girl, I will give you my rea&s;ons for thus ob&s;tinately oppo&s;ing the pro|po&s;ed union. You know I &s;hall be eighteen in September, when being mi&s;tre&s;s of my for|tune, I may di&s;po&s;e of it as I have already de&s;igned, without being an&s;werable to any one. Now, if I marry fir&s;t, I certainly make my hu&s;band ma&s;ter, not only of my&s;elf, but
<PB N="131" REF="029439_0151_0FE112C64812F0B8">
of all I po&s;&s;e&s;s; and how do I know what ob|jections may ari&s;e on his part in the cour&s;e of a few months. I do not mean, that I doubt Rainsforth's genero&s;ity; but a change of circum&s;tances produces a change of ideas, and I think it is be&s;t not to tru&s;t too much to the firmne&s;s of our own hearts.</P>
<P>My aunt laughed the other day, and &s;aid &s;he que&s;tioned if I &s;hould ever be married, for ab&s;ence and &s;alt water are in general a cure for love. It may prove &s;o with &s;ome, but I do not much fear the con&s;tancy of a man who braves even the &s;haft of ridicule, by openly avowing me the woman of his choice; for I can &s;ee many a &s;neering &s;mile, glance from my aunt to her &s;on, whenever they are witne&s;s to his attention to your Meriel. My father and mother &s;eem totally regard|le&s;s, whether I am married now, or when he returns; and I believe, if the truth was known, and very little concerned about my future welfare. But yet, Celia, my bo&s;om cannot forget its natural affections, or dive&s;t it&s;elf of tho&s;e &s;trong &s;en&s;ations of duty, love and veneration, which ever have warmed it, &s;ince my infant tongue fir&s;t li&s;p'd the tender name of mother. As to my father, I cannot &s;ay I feel any emotions in his favour, nor can it be expected I &s;hould, after the &s;cenes which I have imparted to you, the horrors
<PB N="132" REF="029439_0152_0FE112CCCFE15E60">
of which will never be removed from my mind. Alas! they often recur to my ima|gination and ca&s;t a gloom over every ri&s;ing plea&s;ure. Yet, as a man who&s;e happine&s;s is nearly connected with my mother's; as the man whom nature requires me to regard, I will pay him every nece&s;&s;ary re&s;pect, and as &s;ar as the narrow limits of my power will permit, will promote his intere&s;t and felicity.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 19<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>Celia, he is gone; I have this moment bade him farewell. I feel there are moments when all the fortitude, we boa&s;t, &s;inks into nothing oppo&s;ed to the &s;truggles of nature; would you believe it, at the moment when I &s;aw him &s;tep into the chai&s;e, I would have given worlds, had I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, to have been his wife, that I might have gone with him, beheld him to the very la&s;t moment of embarkation, and even then have &s;tood on the &s;hore to catch a la&s;t look at the expand|ed &s;ails which bore him from me, till by de|grees they le&s;&s;ened to my view, and at length were lo&s;t in the va&s;t horizon.</P>
<P>My aunt and cou&s;ins where with us drinking tea; Rainsforth came in, when I in&s;tantly &s;aw &s;omething was the matter. The order is at length arrived, &s;aid I, men|tally,
<PB N="133" REF="029439_0153_0FE112D0A93F2888">
and he comes to bid me adieu; I hand|ed him a cup of tea, he put it to his lips but did not ta&s;te it. "I am come Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid he, "to take my leave; the fleet &s;ails in a few days." "Do you go this evening," &s;aid my mother. "In a few moments, ma|dam," &s;aid he, "I ju&s;t recieved the letter, and accidently met with two brother officers, who were going in a chai&s;e, and gladly ac|cepted me as a third; we mean to take two &s;tages to night, and &s;hall be in Port&s;mouth by to-morrow noon." At that moment the chai&s;e &s;topped at the door. Rainsforth ro&s;e, bowed to my aunt and cou&s;ins, thanked them for all civilities, wi&s;hed my father and mother health, and then turned toward me. My heart was full, &s;o was his; we nei|ther of us &s;poke; he pre&s;&s;ed my hands to his lips, bowed low to hide his emotions, and was in the chai&s;e in an in&s;tant. I knew &s;en&s;ibility would be deemed weakne&s;s by tho&s;e who were witne&s;s to our parting; I therefore &s;truggled to &s;uppre&s;s my ri&s;ing tears, offered up a &s;ilent prayer for his &s;afe return, and endeavoured at a look of com|po&s;ure, that was very foreign to my heart.</P>
<P>What may be his fate, heaven alone can tell; yet &s;ure if worth is its peculiar care, he will not only be protected in this, but in every other danger. But alas! Celia, how
<PB N="134" REF="029439_0154_0FE112D6C6C206B8">
often do we &s;ee merit cut off in its full prime, whil&s;t the unworthy are &s;pared.</P>
<P>Surely, when the brave and good fall in their country's cau&s;e, it mu&s;t be that their virtues merit &s;uch rewards as only heaven can give. They are &s;uffered to appear on the va&s;t theatre of life, to act a little while bright &s;hining parts, and then are called home to receive the glorious mead of hea|venly and uncea&s;ing joys. My mind dwell|ing on this &s;ubject the other evening, (you know I am fond of indulging in little effu|&s;ions of poetry,) and painting to my&s;elf the &s;ituation of a &s;oldier's wife, who has follow|ed her hu&s;band to the very &s;cene of battle, and in the morn, &s;ending him forth to brave the ho&s;tile foe, at night &s;ees him covered with wounds and in the agonies of death; I for a moment fancied my&s;elf in her &s;ituation, and wrote the following trifle. I &s;end it to my Celia without an apology, becau&s;e tri|fles become valuable when they proceed from the friend we love.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 20<HI>th,</HI> 1776.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS brother of mine is a &s;ad lad. He will not be content to remain where he has been placed, but has taken it into his wi&s;e head that he mu&s;t go to &s;ea; no|thing el&s;e will &s;uit him, he cannot, he &s;ays, be confined to the drudgery of a counting|hou&s;e, where a per&s;on may toil all their lives and ri&s;e to nothing above mediocrity. He will go to &s;ea, where, with one bold pu&s;h, it often happens that a man gains both honour and fortune. The lad &s;eems to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;pirit of ambition, yet not that lauda|ble ambition which acts as a &s;timulus to actions great and prai&s;e worthy. It is pow|er and wealth he aims at, and be the &s;teps ever &s;o dirty, by which he mu&s;t arrive at the de&s;ired eminence, I much fear he would not he&s;itate to wade thro' thick and thin.
<PB N="138" REF="029439_0158_0FE112E85CDE8C78">
However, as that is his fixed determination, I mu&s;t e'en be content with the lo&s;s of the apprentice fee, tho' here is a fre&s;h &s;ource of expen&s;e in fitting him out as a mid&s;hipman, for in that &s;ituation I find he can be ad|mitted on board the &s;hip where Rainsforth is lieutenant. I wi&s;h to my &s;oul an intimate acquaintance with this worthy man, may be of &s;ervice to him, for we often in&s;en&s;ibly imbibe the &s;entiments of tho&s;e with whom we a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>My father, I fear, is running into his old errors; he has formed an acquaintance with a Mr. Dell, which in my opinion bodes no good. Dell appears much of the gentleman in his manner, but young Mo&s;&s;op &s;ays he is a profe&s;&s;ed gambler, and I am rather inclin|ed to believe this a&s;&s;ertion, as my father is frequently out with him till three or four in the morning, and has drained us &s;o of mo|ney, that we have not a &s;ingle guinea for hou&s;e expences; this will occa&s;ion our get|ting into debt, and I am afraid my father has already borrowed money on the &s;trength of my promi&s;e, in regard to my fortune; if &s;o all my endeavours to pre&s;erve my mother from want will be ineffectual. This Dell has a wife, whom he once brought to &s;pend an afternoon with us; I do not like her; there was &s;omething in her dre&s;s and man|ner,
<PB N="139" REF="029439_0159_0FE112EDE7167458">
bold, forward and di&s;gu&s;ting; &s;he has been pretty, and is vain enough to think &s;he is &s;o now. My mother does not admire her any more than my&s;elf, and only that &s;he thinks it would highly di&s;oblige my father, &s;he would by no means either recieve or re|turn her vi&s;its.</P>
<P>Another &s;ource of unhappine&s;s to this dear &s;uffering woman is my father's giving way to a habit of drinking, for he is almo&s;t continually intoxicated, and &s;o extremely captious and ill natured that it is next to im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay or do any thing to plea&s;e him. Poor dear mother how my heart bleeds for your afflictions; how many years have you pa&s;t wherein you can &s;carcely &s;ay, you have &s;een one happy hour; and could I, but lead you to repo&s;e your &s;orrows on the bo&s;om of your child! but no, you think that child unworthy of your love, unworthy your con|fidence; and &s;he dares not clear her&s;elf, le&s;t by endeavouring to remove one &s;orrow from your heart, &s;he &s;hould throw another on it that would cru&s;h you with its weight.</P>
<P>I have heard from Rainsforth but once &s;ince the fleet &s;ailed. Oh! Celia, &s;hould he one day afflict my heart, by har&s;hne&s;s, cru|elty or infidelity; ah! my friend, if the thought thus wrings my bo&s;om, what would
<PB N="140" REF="029439_0160_0FE112F35AE4B078">
the reality do; and yet, I would endeavour to bear it with the meekne&s;s of a wife, and the fortitude of a chri&s;tian; but me thinks I would wi&s;h to &s;ink at once under the dread|ful certainty; doubt and &s;u&s;picion would torture me to the very utmo&s;t of my &s;trength to bear, but to be convinced I had out lived his affection, mu&s;t, I am convinced, be in|&s;tant death or madne&s;s.</P>
<P>My letters have now nothing intere&s;ting in them; Indeed, Celia, I begin to think every thing in&s;ipid and tire&s;ome, that is not concerning Rainsforth; even reading no more amu&s;es. If I read of a worthy charac|ter, &s;uch a one I cry is my Frederic; then I drop the book to mu&s;e upon his virtues, and if I take up my pen I can write but an invocation to heaven for his &s;afety. The on|ly relief I find is in con&s;tant employment, and therefore, I &s;eldom pa&s;s an idle hour, my needle, my pencil, and my dome&s;tic con|cerns, plea&s;ingly variegate the &s;cene, and prevent my complaining of la&s;&s;itude. I go out but little, and &s;ee but few vi&s;itors, my cou&s;ins indeed frequently call, but as I do not mix in the &s;ame gay circles they do, I can join but little in their conver&s;ation; they tell me many lively anecdotes that amu&s;e me; I li&s;ten to their account of a ball, a concert, or any other fa&s;hionable amu&s;ement

<P>WILL my dear Meriel believe that it is with pain I take up my pen to ad|dre&s;s her; that I am at lo&s;s for words, yet ardently long to pour out my &s;oul before her.

<P>"ADIEU, forever," did you &s;ay: no, Rainsforth, no! we &s;hall yet meet many times, our &s;ouls are congenial; they
<PB N="146" REF="029439_0166_0FE1130F0EBA1C70">
were animated the by &s;ame &s;park of intel|lectual fire, and tho' we cannot claim a near|er tie, we &s;hall be friends to the late&s;t hour of our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>My generous, noble friend, I do not blu&s;h to &s;ay my e&s;teem, (nay call it love, if you will) is increa&s;ed by this proof of your mag|nanimity; call it not a re&s;ignation, I am your's I will never be another's; unle&s;s I can find one your &s;uperior in every virtue, that can exalt and dignify human nature, and in &s;aying that, I think I am irrevocably bound to you. There may be men who po&s;&s;e&s;s equal goodne&s;s of heart, but there can be none who can boa&s;t a &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ibly affected at your father's mi&s;|fortunes; would to heaven it was in my power to remove every affliction far from him. Not &s;o much from the idea that his troubles have interrupted my happine&s;s; but that I am certain your feeling heart &s;uf|fers tho&s;e misfortunes doubly, in &s;eeing them inflicted on one &s;o de&s;ervedly dear to you. But let us look forward my friend; the pro&s;pect is not &s;o dark, but that the &s;un of pro&s;perity may yet brake forth to enliven it; you may yet live to &s;ee your father rein&s;tat|ed in the afluence, from which he is at pre|&s;ent removed by an all-wi&s;e Providence, on|ly
<PB N="147" REF="029439_0167_0FE11312A4CC0B40">
to teach him the value of pa&s;t ble&s;&s;ings. We never know rightly, how to prize a be|nefit, till we have known what it is to lo&s;e it; I write feelingly Rainsforth, for, I knew not half your worth till the very moment that I &s;aw an in&s;uperable barrier placed between us, and now I wi&s;h I had li&s;tened to your &s;olicita|tions, for then at this moment I might have admini&s;tered comfort to your drooping &s;pi|rits, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the delightful ta&s;k of &s;oothing the &s;orrows of your parents. But why &s;hould I be &s;o &s;elfi&s;h, the plea&s;ure would have been all my own; for &s;ure I knew your generous heart too well, to &s;uppo&s;e it would not have &s;uffered from the idea of my &s;haring in afflictions, which could not have been prevented, and hardly admit of any aleviation. To &s;ay I felt nothing when I read your pathetic letter, would be to pro|nounce my&s;elf in&s;en&s;ible. Believe me, I felt all; nay, perhaps more than you could have wi&s;hed; however, of this be a&s;&s;ured, that nothing but a total change in you can occa|tion any alteration in my &s;entiments. If it will be more conducive to your happine&s;s; here let the corre&s;pondence cea&s;e, and &s;hould you hereafter meet a woman, who&s;e merits and fortune render her worthy your attach|ment; may you be as happy in the union

<P>IT is in vain to &s;trive again&s;t fate. My father is re&s;olved not to pau&s;e in his ca|reer of folly, till we are all involved in ruin.
<PB N="149" REF="029439_0169_0FE1131BF784E018">
The money I pre&s;ented to my mother, when I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my fortune, is all mould|ered away, and even the little capital I had re&s;erved for myfelf, broke in upon. I know you will &s;ay I am pur&s;uing my notions of filial duty now to imprudence; I fear I am, and yet, my dear Celia, were you &s;itu|ated as I am, I &s;o well know your heart, that I am certain you would have conducted your&s;elf exactly in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>About three days &s;ince, a gentleman cal|led and pre&s;ented a bill for payment, drawn by my brother, who had given my mother notice of his de&s;ign; but &s;he, fearful of mentioning it, as &s;he had no means of an|&s;wering the demand, had kept it to her&s;elf. It was for an hundred pounds. Ungenerous lad! when he knew how narrow our circum|&s;tances were, and how much his incon&s;i&s;tent conduct had embarra&s;&s;ed us. When the man brought the bill, my poor mother turn|ed pale as a&s;hes. "What is the matter, madam," &s;aid I. She called me into the next room, and putting the bill into my hand, (for it was &s;ome days after &s;ight) &s;he &s;aid, "what mu&s;t I do." "Indeed my dear madam," I replied, "I cannot tell. It is not in my power to do any more, the bill mu&s;t be prote&s;ted, and I hope it will teach him frugality in future. I am &s;ure he mu&s;t

have been very extravagant, or he never could have wanted money &s;o &s;oon, con&s;ider|ing the &s;um he took with him." She made me no an&s;wer, but bur&s;ting into tears cried, "then all is over, my poor Richard." I ne|ver can &s;ee my mother in affliction, but my heart yearns &s;pontaniou&s;ly to fly to her re|lief. How then could I behold her tears unmoved, how hold back that comfort &s;he required, when &s;he thus continued to addre&s;s me. "I know, Meriel, we have almo&s;t re|duced you to beggary, I am fully &s;en&s;ible how much we owe to your genero&s;ity." "Dear, dear mother, talk not &s;o," &s;aid I, throwing my arms about her, "I have done nothing but my duty, and I think it &s;till my duty to pre&s;erve the remainder of my for|tune, to comfort you in your declining age." "But think of your brother, Meriel," cried &s;he eagerly, "think my dear girl, what &s;traits he may reduced to in a foreign land. If this bill is not paid, my poor boy will be thrown into pri&s;on, and be lo&s;t for want of a friend to comfort him. Oh! Meriel, re|fu&s;e not your mother this one reque&s;t." And ah! my Celia, may I never meet &s;uch ano|ther trial. The dear woman knelt; yes, my mother knelt to me before I had the time or power to prevent her. "Good heavens!" &s;aid I, "this is too much, take me, dear mother, do with me and mine as

you think proper, only I be&s;eech you do not let me be thus humiliated. 'Tis I &s;hould have knelt to you, oh! ri&s;e, and do not thus di&s;tre&s;s me. I will pay the bill."</P>
<P>The next day I took up money &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, and al&s;o to di&s;charge &s;ome few debts in the neighbourhood, &s;o that our income is now &s;o reduced that I mu&s;t be obliged to turn my thoughts towards &s;ome genteel employment, however repugnant it is to my father and mother's inclinations. In my opinion, the per&s;on who has talents, health and &s;pirits to earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is in all re&s;pects independent, and there is no|thing to me would be more painful, than to eat the bread of indolence. Pride may teach another le&s;&s;on, but then it is not the pride which elevates the human heart. It &s;hall be ever my pride to keep free from ob|ligation. It is always a painful &s;en&s;e, but more e&s;pecially when we have no power to return it. Let my habitation be ever &s;o humble, and my fare ever &s;o coar&s;e, if they are the fruits of my own indu&s;try, they will be &s;weeter, more comfortable by far, than the greate&s;t luxuries purcha&s;ed by the cringe of &s;ervility.</P>

<P>Rejoice with me, my dear Celia, the pro&s;|pect once more brightens. I ye&s;terday re|ceived the following letter from Rainsforth.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MISS HOWARD.</HEAD>
<P>MY ever loved, my con&s;tant Meriel will, I am certain, rejoice to hear that my father is again re&s;tored to affluence. A di&s;tant relation, lately dead, has bequeathed the whole of his wealth, which is very con&s;ide|rable, to our family. To me he has given five thou&s;and pounds. Then let me ha&s;ten to bid my beloved Meriel be prepared to &s;ee me; for this day week, I will come to de|mand her long promi&s;ed hand, and &s;eal my|&s;elf before the altar, her's eternally.</P>

<P>And &s;hall I now ever dare to complain of pa&s;t trials, my Celia? has not this proof of his love and con&s;tancy endeared him more than ever to my heart? Oh my friend, my &s;pirits are &s;o agitated, I cannot write or &s;peak with any coherence, I mu&s;t throw a&s;ide my pen and endeavour to compo&s;e my thoughts.</P>

I &s;hall make but little preparation again&s;t his arrival. I know he regards me only for my&s;elf, and alas! that is all I now have to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Two days more and I &s;hall &s;ee him; think me not weak, if I tell you I &s;hall count the hours with impatience. After a &s;eperation of near two years, how plea&s;ing to meet a friend whom we know to be &s;o worthy, and whom we had given up as lo&s;t. Farewell, my dear Celia, your plea&s;ures are all of the calm un|ru&s;&s;led kind, like the &s;mooth &s;tream that glides beneath a lofty bank, by which it is defended from the rude bla&s;ts of wind. It continues one gentle unvaried cour&s;e, and its charms can neither be increa&s;ed or dimi|ni&s;hed.</P>

<P>I HAVE expected morning after morning with hope, and each day as it arrived brought with it only di&s;appointment.

is married! married to another, and within a fortnight after the day appointed to unite him to me.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in He&s;ter called on me ye&s;terday to take a walk; we called on a lady of her acquaintance who has a &s;i&s;ter married at Plymouth, for He&s;ter &s;ugge&s;ted that through her means we might gain &s;ome intelligence concerning Rainsforth. After the u&s;ual ce|remonies, when we were &s;eated, He&s;ter en|quired when &s;he had heard from her &s;i&s;ter, "I had a letter ye&s;terday," &s;he replied, "Kitty has been very gay, I a&s;&s;ure you, they have had great doings at Plymouth, Mi&s;s Kingly, the great heire&s;s, was married la&s;t Monday, and Kitty was at the wedding." "And pray who is &s;he married to?" &s;aid He&s;ter. "A young officer in the navy," &s;he replied, "whom &s;he has been fond of for &s;ome time; I really forget his name, but there is the letter, you may read the whole account."</P>
<P>I do not know how I &s;upported my|&s;elf, while I ca&s;t my eye over the letter, as my cou&s;in held it in her hand, but I caught the name of Rainsforth; my head grew giddy, I turned cold and faint; but by the exertion of my re&s;olution avoided making my&s;elf ridiculous. "Upon my word," cou|&s;in,

&s;aid He&s;ter without any regard to my feelings, in expo&s;ing me to a &s;tranger, "up|on my word, this is very unaccountable." "Why pray," &s;aid the lady, "is it the Mr. Rainsforth I have &s;een &s;o often with you Mi&s;s Mo&s;&s;op?" "The very &s;ame, and will you believe it, he was under a promi&s;e of marriage to my cou&s;in here; do you not think it very &s;candalous behaviour?" "Scan|dalous indeed: if I was in Mi&s;s Howard's place I would &s;ue him for half his wife's for|tune."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall not give either my&s;elf or him that trouble, madam, (I replied with as much compo&s;ure as I could a&s;&s;ume,) I think &s;ince he has proved him&s;elf of &s;o fickle a nature, he has done me a favour rather than an injury, as it would have been much more painful to me to lo&s;e the affection of a hu&s;band than a lover.

<P>I returned home from this vi&s;it with a heavy heart, but &s;till flattered my&s;elf there might be &s;ome mi&s;take; but the receipt of the letter I inclo&s;e for your peru&s;al has re|moved every doubt.</P>

<P>WITH this letter, my dear Celia, came a parcel containing all the letters I had ever wrote a Rainsforth; and believe me, the unfeeling tenor of his father's letter did not hurt me half &s;o much, as the idea of his cruelty, in &s;uffering his father fir&s;t to peru&s;e, and then return them; my pride was alarm|ed, my &s;en&s;ibility &s;hocked! a man in whom I placed &s;uch implicit confidence; one whom I thought endowed with every virtue. Celia, I feel a painful void in my heart; I feel that I &s;hall never again place a confidence in any man. My cou&s;in He&s;ter has frequently told me, that Rainsforth was decietful, that he

&s;aw my partiality and played upon it, mere|ly for his own diver&s;ion; but I always doubt|ed; nay, to &s;uch a height was my enthu|&s;ia&s;m rai&s;ed, I could not have believed it po&s;&s;ible for one who wore &s;o fair a &s;emblance of virtue, to be &s;o very fal&s;e, &s;o unaccounta|bly wanton in his cruelty towards an inof|fen&s;ive girl, who&s;e whole &s;oul was ab&s;orbed in one affectionate wi&s;h for his felicity: why, when I had taught my heart to re&s;ign him without a murmur; why, when the fir&s;t hard trial was pa&s;t, and every hope was ex|tingui&s;hed, did he &s;eek to awaken a pa&s;&s;ion, which, tho' rea&s;on had in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|pelled its violence, was &s;till tender, &s;till ar|dent in my bo&s;om. Oh! my friend, had he without renewing the corre&s;pondence which we had mutually agreed to drop, given his hand to Mi&s;s Kingly, I &s;hould not have com|plained; no, my Celia, &s;o pure was my love, that I &s;hould have exulted in his felici|ty, and whil&s;t I thought him worthy of every ble&s;&s;ing, have rejoiced to &s;ee them placed within his reach. But alas! he is not wor|thy, and perhaps this poor gentle affection|ate girl, for &s;uch I am told &s;he is, may &s;oon experience a change in his &s;entiments, when &s;he has neither the power to leave him, nor liberty to complain of his conduct.</P>

<P>I begin to be more compo&s;ed; I am re|&s;olved to de&s;pi&s;e the whole &s;ex; they may wear a &s;emblance of virtue, but the reality of it is foreign to their hearts. Every oc|currence of life will be now equally indiffer|ent to me; I have vowed to devote my&s;elf to my mother while &s;he lives, and whenever heaven plea&s;es to call her away, my ince&s;|&s;ant prayer &s;hall be &s;oon to follow; I do not wi&s;h to go before her, becau&s;e, I &s;ee her only hope of &s;upport mu&s;t proceed from me; and unboundedly grateful will be my heart, if by any means whatever I can pre&s;erve her from mi&s;ery.</P>

Can you think, my friend, that in this mi&s;erable &s;ituation I have yet one ray of comfort breaks on my benight|ed &s;oul; yes, Celia, I have: my dear mother is at length convinced, that my love, my duti|ful attentions, are the re&s;ult of the feelings of my heart.

I had been out one af|ternoon on particular bu&s;ine&s;s; indeed to look after &s;ome employment, whereby I might conduce to the &s;upport of the family. On my return I found my mother weeping
<PB N="9" REF="029439_0184_0FE1135DA7043090">
over a bit of paper, which &s;he held in her hand. I enquired the cau&s;e. She gave me the paper, and I read on it, "Barwell, She|riff's officer, Carey-&s;treet." "Your father is arre&s;ted, Meriel," &s;aid &s;he. "Gracious heaven!" &s;aid I, "then we are all ruined: but what is the &s;um; at who&s;e &s;uit is he arre&s;ted." "At the &s;uit of that villain Dell," &s;he replied, "for fifty pounds, which he has lent him; no doubt at the gaming table; he al&s;o threatens him with a pro&s;e|cution for a criminal corre&s;pondence with his wife. Oh heavens!" continued &s;he, re|doubling her tears, "when &s;hall I die and be at peace." It was in vain to offer con|&s;olation. I did not even attempt it, but re|&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ee if any thing could be done, either to ward off the impending blow, or to extricate us from the difficulties attending it. I went immediately to an at|torney, made him acquainted with the ca&s;e, and reque&s;ted his advice. He told me there was no redre&s;s, that the money mu&s;t be paid, and in ca&s;e of the pro&s;ecution, it was mo&s;t likely he would be ca&s;t with damages. This intelligence was an additional weight upon my &s;pirits. However, I proceeded to Carey|&s;treet, where I found this thoughtle&s;s father &s;urrounded by unfortunate men of the low|e&s;t cla&s;s, with a bowl of punch before him, and in the very act of &s;inging a drinking

&s;ong. When he &s;aw me, he looked aba&s;hed. I a&s;ked if I coud &s;peak to him in another room, for my &s;oul &s;hrunk from the &s;ociety of tho&s;e unhappy beings, with whom he &s;eemed &s;o plea&s;ed. When we were accom|modated with another apartment, I a&s;ked him, how this debt was contracted, and by what means he meant to di&s;charge it. I can|not repeat to you the an&s;wer he made; it was &s;o replete with contradiction, that I had &s;carcely patience to hear him out. When he had fini&s;hed, I enquired, if that debt was paid, were there no others of the &s;ame &s;ort. "Con&s;ider &s;ir," &s;aid I, "it will not be long I &s;hall have it in my power to an&s;wer the&s;e demands, and when my money is entirely expended, where is my dear mother to find &s;upport." "Ah Meriel," &s;aid he, "you are always more anxious about her than me, you don't care what becomes of your father." "I &s;hould think, &s;ir," &s;aid I with &s;ome warmth, "that I had given &s;ufficient proof of my attention to the happine&s;s of both. I am &s;orry to u&s;e any language to a father, which may be deemed improper; but I mu&s;t &s;ay, had you paid as much attention to your own happine&s;s as was undoubtedly your duty, many of the afflictions, if not all which have fallen upon our family, might have been avoided. I will pay this money &s;ir, and I hope you will not think I take too

great a liberty if I advi&s;e you, hereafter to &s;hun &s;uch unworthy acquaintance as Dell, and &s;trive rather to obtain &s;ome genteel em|ployment, by which the&s;e kind of &s;cenes may in future be avoided.</P>
<P>"You talk like a very unfeeling girl, Meriel," &s;aid he. "Do you imagine then it is &s;o ea&s;y for a man, born and brought up a gentleman, to &s;ubmit to the drudgery of &s;er|vitude: no Mi&s;s; if your ideas are &s;o mean, mine are not, I will &s;tarve fir&s;t, and would rather &s;ee you &s;tarve than have my family di&s;graced by your following any &s;ervile, mean employment." Believe me, Celia, when he uttered the&s;e &s;entiments, I felt &s;o irritated by his fooli&s;h pride, that had not the idea of my &s;uffering mother at that moment obtruded on my mind, I &s;hould have left him to his fate. However, I &s;tifled my ri&s;ing an|ger, and having given him a draught on my banker to di&s;charge the arre&s;t, returned to con&s;ole my mother. When I entered, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her grief more violent than ever. She was wringing her hands and weep|ing with great bitterne&s;s. After many fruit|le&s;s enquiries concerning this fre&s;h torrent of &s;orrow, I learnt that Mr. Le&s;age, the ban|ker, with whom I had placed the trifling rem|nant of my fortune, was declared a bankrupt. To de&s;cribe my feelings is impo&s;&s;ible. How|ever
<PB N="12" REF="029439_0187_0FE1136BAEABE040">
I &s;aw my mother wanted comfort, and I exerted my utmo&s;t power to &s;tifle emotions, which if indulged, would only &s;erve to in|crea&s;e her angui&s;h.</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t go to pri&s;on," &s;aid &s;he, "we mu&s;t all go to pri&s;on, and who is to &s;upport us there?" "Providence, my dear mother," &s;aid I, "We will place our hopes on that be|nign power, who never for&s;akes tho&s;e, who, in full confidence of &s;upport, exert their utmo&s;t abilities and rely on him only for &s;ucce&s;s. Come, come, chear up, thank God, I am healthy and able to work." She gaz|ed on me for a moment; then throwing her arms round me, &s;he cried, "oh! my child, I will doubt your virtue no longer; your heart mu&s;t be pure, or you could not thus rely on heaven for &s;upport; but oh! my dear Meriel, it will wound my heart &s;e|verely to &s;ee you obliged to labour for &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence." "Do not think of it," &s;aid I; "let me &s;ee you but tolerably happy and I &s;hall not regret any hard&s;hip, however &s;e|vere: I will never leave you, my beloved mother; only let me be once more called the child of your affection, and I &s;hall think my&s;elf completely rewarded for every &s;uffer|ing it may plea&s;e heaven to inflict." A few days after this, my father was removed to this mi&s;erable place: we &s;old the be&s;t part
<PB N="13" REF="029439_0188_0FE11371444093C8">
of our furniture and cloaths to di&s;charge the debts owing among our trades people. My mother then came to my father: I do not &s;leep in the pri&s;on, but come here every morning; I perform all their dome&s;tic of|fices, go out for their provi&s;ion, &amp;c. but as yet, have not been able to procure any work. Indeed, I had hope of being em|ployed by an embroiderer, but on being a&s;ked to give &s;ecurity, for the &s;afety of what|ever work I might be entru&s;ted with; I un|fortunately happened to mention, being re|lated to Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's family; of cour&s;e, the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop applied to my aunt for my character. Celia, this aunt denied any knowledge of me, &s;aid &s;he had no relation who was in circum&s;tances to want employ|ment of that kind, that &s;he had &s;ome know|ledge of a young woman of the name of Howard, &s;he believed, I might be very ho|ne&s;t but I was certainly no relation of her's.</P>
<P>Thus my dear girl, was my laudable de|&s;ign fru&s;trated; for the man naturally enough ob&s;erved if I could be guilty of tell|ing a lie; I might be capable of wor&s;e ac|tions. I hope, however, in a &s;hort time to procure &s;omething to do; for our little &s;tock of money dimini&s;hes very fa&s;t.</P>

<P>Of all the &s;cenes through which we are doomed to pa&s;s, &s;ure none is &s;o truly pain|ful, as that of being witne&s;s to the death of tho&s;e whom nature has placed in a near re|lation to us; whom, &s;pite of all their errors, we cannot wholly dive&s;t our hearts of ten|derne&s;s for; and to &s;ee them approach the awful confines of eternity in a frame of mind, that renders all offered comfort ineffectual, to calm their doubts and fears, when the retro&s;pect of their pa&s;t lives fills them only with horror; and the idea of futurity brings nothing but de&s;pair. Such a &s;cene I have lately pa&s;t; my father is no more: he is I hope at peace; to think otherwi&s;e would be an agony too great to bear: poor man, to the very la&s;t he was addicted to the fatal errors that had undone him. Few were the hours he &s;pent in the apartment with my mother, being chiefly at a place, which they call the tap, where he could drown his care, as he vainly imagined, and where he was frequently drawn in to play cards, tho' &s;ome|times for the la&s;t &s;ix-pence he had in his pocket.</P>
<P>One evening, at this place he quarrelled with his antagoni&s;t, and high words en&s;ued; from words they went to blows, and my fa|ther
<PB N="15" REF="029439_0190_0FE1137A7B2E6400">
recieved a &s;troke on his temple, which leveled him with the ground. He fell with the back of his head again&s;t an iron fender which cut him &s;everely and fractured the &s;kull; all a&s;&s;i&s;tance was vain; he langui&s;hed four days, in all the complicated agonies of pain of body and di&s;tre&s;s of mind; tho' I flatter my&s;elf he had &s;ome internal comfort in his la&s;t moments, as he &s;eemed more compo&s;ed for about two hours before his death. He earne&s;tly reque&s;ted forgivene&s;s of both my mother and my&s;elf, for the manifold injuries he had done us; but to my great comfort, mentioned no particulars: he al&s;o made a declaration before witne&s;&s;es that the man who &s;truck the unfortunate blow, was en|tirely guiltle&s;s of intentional malice, as he had been the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or him&s;elf; and the fall was entirely accidental. He expre&s;&s;|ed a wi&s;h to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter; in compliance with his earne&s;t de&s;ire I went to her, told her of the melancholy accident, and earne&s;t|ly reque&s;ted &s;he would vi&s;it my dying father.</P>
<P>"Upon my word Meriel," &s;aid &s;he, "I am extremely &s;orry for this &s;hocking affair; but you know child my &s;eeing him will be of no u&s;e; it will only be hurting my own feelings, with out being of the lea&s;t &s;ervice to your father. I never can bear &s;cenes of this kind; my &s;en&s;ibility is &s;o exqui&s;ite, that, was I to &s;ee my poor brother in this &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="16" REF="029439_0191_0FE11380465DAB50">
I &s;hould not recover it for a month. Ah! poor man, he was always getting into &s;ome mi&s;chief or other; he never pro&s;pered in any thing after his marriage with your mother."</P>
<P>"You cannot &s;uppo&s;e, madam, that the want of pro&s;perity was to be attributed to that union."</P>
<P>"Why, I don't know, Meriel, my bro|ther never loved your mother, but was art|fully drawn in." "By whom, madam?" "By your grand mother, Mi&s;s, who wi&s;hed to get a good &s;ettlement for her daugh|ter. Your mother too, pretended &s;uch a violent affection for him, that he could not refu&s;e &s;ome little return of kindne&s;s, and they never cea&s;ed their arts till they had noo&s;ed him fa&s;t."</P>
<P>"You talk in riddles, madam, my mother brought my father a genteel fortune."</P>
<P>"It was nothing, Mi&s;s, to the fortune he might have expected, if he had not of|fended his father; I always &s;aid no good would come of the match." "It is much to be wi&s;hed, indeed, madam," &s;aid I, "that &s;uch a union never had taken place; it would have &s;pared my dear mother many
<PB N="17" REF="029439_0192_0FE11385F416A7E0">
years of &s;evere angui&s;h, and my unfortunate &s;elf would never have &s;een the light." As I &s;aid this my heart was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed I could not refrain my tears. "Ble&s;s me! my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mo&s;&s;op, in an affected accent of kindne&s;s; "I did not mean to vex you, you are not to be blamed for your parents faults."</P>
<P>"If they have faults, madam," &s;aid I, "be a&s;&s;ured I wi&s;h not to hear of them, it would be a painful topic at any time, but pardon me, if I &s;ay, at this particular &s;ea&s;on, it is a cruel one. I come to intreat you to vi&s;it a brother, who is poor and dying in pri&s;on. I &s;hould think, had he millions of faults, at this moment they would be all for|gotten; that you would remember only his afflictions, and that he was your brother." I &s;poke this with &s;ome warmth; my aunt he&s;itated for an an&s;wer; at length &s;he told me &s;he would come the next morning. "It will be too late, madam," &s;aid I, "it is thought he cannot live the night out." "Dear, dear," &s;he replied, "it is &s;o un|fortunate that I have a large party coming this afternoon, but if they leave me in any tolerable &s;ea&s;on"&mdash;I would hear no more, but turning from her with a mixture of con|tempt and pity, I returned to the habitation of mourning and death. When I entered
<PB N="18" REF="029439_0193_0FE1138B9FEB3FD8">
the room, my father enquired eagerly if &s;he would come; I thought it would be wrong to di&s;turb his la&s;t moments, with an account of her unfeeling conduct, I therefore only told him, &s;he was not able to come that evening, but would be there early in the morning. "It will be too late then," &s;aid he, "I mu&s;t write to her." It was in vain we remon&s;trated; he would be rai&s;ed in the bed, with a de&s;ign to write; but his head would not permit him to trace even a &s;ingle letter: he was &s;eized with faintings and when he recovered &s;eemed to have forgot his de&s;ign. He &s;poke but little afterwards, was wholly taken up in prayer: tho' he frequently cried out in agony, "'tis all in vain, I cannot be forgiven." A worthy well di&s;po&s;ed clergyman prayed be&s;ided him, and &s;aid a great deal to compo&s;e him, and calm his doubts. It had in &s;ome mea&s;ure the de&s;ired effect: and about four o'clock in the morning, he re&s;igned his &s;oul into the hand of Him who gave it.</P>
<P>My mother's &s;orrow is not to be de&s;crib|ed. All thought of our dreadful, de&s;olate &s;ituation was entirely ab&s;orbed in this heavy affliction. I did not attempt to interrupt her grief, as I thought, if &s;uffered to take its natural cour&s;e, time would meliorate a &s;orrow, which, any attempt at pre&s;ent to
<PB N="19" REF="029439_0194_0FE11390546EB680">
&s;often, would but increa&s;e. In the cour&s;e of the next day, we expected my aunt to make the promi&s;ed vi&s;it; but as the day pa&s;|&s;ed without &s;eeing her, in the evening my mother de&s;ired me to go to her again, and inform him of our lo&s;s. I went, but was &s;uffered to wait near an hour, before &s;he ap|peared; nor did my cou&s;ins come near me, tho' I heard them laughing and talking in the next room. Ah! &s;aid I, mentally, the afflicted are never admitted chearfully; they are left to indulge their own &s;ad thoughts in &s;olitude. Cruel He&s;ter and Su&s;an, had you been in affliction, would not I have abridged my own plea&s;ures to comfort and con&s;ole you. When my aunt entered the room &s;he began; "realy Meriel I have not been able to vi&s;it my brother before; but now I have half an hour to &s;pare, I will &s;end for a coach, and we will go together." "Your vi&s;it will no doubt be acceptable to my mother, dear madam," &s;aid I, "but my father is no long|er in a &s;ituation."&mdash;</P>
<P>"He is dead then," cried &s;he eagerly.</P>
<P>I bowed my head in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"Well," continued &s;he, "I rather ex|pected it, and I am much obliged to you for calling, to let me know, as I &s;hould have
<PB N="20" REF="029439_0195_0FE11395E2E384C0">
been greatly &s;hocked to have found him dead, when I had called, as I certainly &s;hould, either this evening or to-morow morning."</P>
<P>"My mother bid me a&s;k your advice con|cerning the funeral madam, and not only your advice, but your a&s;&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>"A&s;&s;i&s;tance, for what child?"</P>
<P>"Could you advance us a little money?"</P>
<P>"Money, Mi&s;s Howard! You a&s;toni&s;h me; it is impo&s;&s;ible you can be in want of money, when you came to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o hand&s;ome a fortune within the&s;e two years."</P>
<P>"I am very &s;orry madam, that you can &s;uppo&s;e me capable of &s;uffering my parents to langui&s;h in pri&s;on for fifty pounds, if I could have commanded &s;uch a &s;um."</P>
<P>"Why as to that Meriel, I thought you were acting like a prudent girl, and meant to take care of your&s;elf; for I know you paid a great deal of money for your father, and might have continued &s;o doing till you had ruined your&s;elf."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="029439_0196_0FE11398A19BFD18">
"I &s;hould certainly have paid this la&s;t debt, madam, had not the failure of Mr. Le&s;age put it entirely out of my power."</P>
<P>"Oh I remember hearing, that you lo&s;t &s;ix hundred pounds by his failure, but you &s;urely had a larger &s;um by you than that."</P>
<P>"Indeed aunt, that &s;ix hundred pounds was all the dependence I had in the world."</P>
<P>"Upon my word Meriel, I never was more a&s;toni&s;hed in my life. How have you contrived to run thro' all that money. Your mother and your&s;elf mu&s;t have been very ex|travagant, and when that is the ca&s;e, nothing will &s;ave people from ruin. I am very &s;orry child, very &s;orry; but it is not in my pow|er to help you; I have a large family, and the education of my daughters is expen&s;ive. As to my poor brother, why, my advice is, that you have him buried as privately, and with as little expen&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. You will remember me to your mother; tell her I am r&eacute;ally concerned at her trouble; but it is entirely out my power to help her, nor indeed, do I think it would be of any u&s;e; for was &s;he releived from the&s;e difficulties, &s;he would &s;oon be involved by her impru|dence, in others of the &s;ame &s;ort."</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="029439_0197_0FE113A389A79A78">
When I repeated this conver&s;ation to my mother, &s;he &s;aid, "it is no more than I ex|pected, my dear child; but I let you go to make trial of her heart, that you might be convinced, how little depedence is to be placed on profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, made to us in our pro&s;perity; and how little a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance is to be hoped from relations. We will &s;ell every valuable of our cloaths and plate, to lay your father decently in the ground, and to pay the debt for which I now am become liable. It will, I am cer|tain, leave us almo&s;t de&s;titute; but when we have our liberty, we can perhaps gain employment of &s;ome kind or other, I will not mind how abject; for I would rather hardly earn, or indeed beg my bread from &s;trangers, than be &s;ubject to the unkind|ne&s;s of haughty, unfeeling relations."</P>
<P>This re&s;olution was immediately execut|ed, and when all expences were di&s;charg|ed, we found our&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of five guineas, &s;ome trifling hou&s;ehold furniture, and the meane&s;t of our cloaths. With the&s;e we left that abode of mi&s;ery, the Fleet pri|&s;on, and have taken a cheap lodging, on the Surry &s;ide of Black friars bridge. I have endeavoured to get &s;ome work, but as yet without effect; and what adds to my un|ea&s;ine&s;s, is, that my dear mother's health
<PB N="23" REF="029439_0198_0FE1139EB0911B00">
daily declines. As I have no other amu&s;e|ment, I &s;pend a good deal of time at my pen. I have wrote &s;everal little poems, which I intend to correct and offer to &s;ome book&s;eller. Perhaps by that means, I may obtain &s;omething towards our &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. I feel a tran&s;ient ray of hope dawn upon my mind. My mother &s;miling, tells me, I am too &s;anguine; but my dear Celia, I always was inclined to take the brighte&s;t &s;ide of the pro&s;pect, to hope for the be&s;t, and when di&s;appointment arrives, to &s;ubmit with as much patience as I can. I am what is ge|nerally termed a ca&s;tle builder; it is a weak|ne&s;s (if it de&s;erves the appellation) from which I derive amu&s;ement at lea&s;t, and tho' I know at the very moment I am indulging tho&s;e &s;anguine ideas, that my hopes have no more foundation, than the bubble blown from the pipe of a playful boy; yet I can|not help being plea&s;ed with the airy fabric of my own creating, and as &s;oon as one va|ni&s;hes, (to continue the allu&s;ion) I puff out another, and &s;o prevent my&s;elf from be|coming a prey to de&s;pair. And, believe me Celia, I con&s;ider this di&s;po&s;ition, as one of the choice&s;t gifts of heaven. Adieu my friend; may you be happier than </P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>December</HI> 5<HI>th,</HI> 1778.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now &s;ome months &s;ince I have taken up my pen to addre&s;s my dear Celia. Several times lately I have e&s;&s;ayed to do it, but unable to bear a retro&s;pect of my late heavy affliction, have from time to time, de|ferred the painful recital, till I begin to fear my dear friend will think I am either num|bered with the dead, or become forgetful of her friend&s;hip. I have a long tale to tell my dear girl, a tale, which I fear, will &s;teal many a tear from your eyes as you peru&s;e it. In my la&s;t I informed you of my mother's ill health, and how unable we were to procure any pro|per advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. From that time her malady daily increa&s;ed. I fini&s;hed my little collection of poems and pre&s;ented them to a book&s;eller; but he told me, I had mi&s;taken my talents, and that the whole collection was
<PB N="25" REF="029439_0200_0FE113ACD3053B70">
not worth a guinea. Di&s;heartened and di&s;piri|ted I returned to my mother, and now gave up my whole time to watching and attend|ing her. Her di&s;order increa&s;ed with &s;uch rapidity, that in the cour&s;e of a few weeks &s;he was confined to her bed. What a pro&s;|pect had I now before me, a beloved parent &s;inking by &s;low degrees into the grave; when I had no method of procuring the comforts, and even the nece&s;&s;aries of life were denied. I had parted with all our apparel, except a change of linen, and had now pa&s;t one whole day without food. My mother made no complaints; but her pale wan countenance, was to me a thou&s;and times more affecting than unavailing exclamations. Our credit had been long lo&s;t in the neighbourhood, and I knew that in a few days we mu&s;t in|evitably peri&s;h for want. In this &s;ituation, I took a re&s;olution to go out in the clo&s;e of the evening and &s;olicit the charity of the benevo|lent. I told my tale of &s;orrow to many of my own &s;ex. They either heard me not, or di&s;believed my a&s;&s;ertions, and after &s;aunter|ing through the &s;treets near three hours, one cold wet night in October, I at length col|lected about &s;ix-pence, and with it having procured &s;ome trifling nouri&s;hment for my almo&s;t fami&s;hed parent, I returned, allowing my&s;elf only a halfpenny roll. When I car|ried my little mor&s;el to her bed&s;ide, &s;he
<PB N="26" REF="029439_0201_0FE113B207072608">
anxiou&s;ly enquired how I had procured it. "Some charitable di&s;po&s;ed per&s;on," &s;aid I, "gave me the means; take it my mother, eat and be comforted."</P>
<P>Sinking nature required &s;upport; &s;he eat the offered mor&s;el, but &s;ea&s;oned it with tears of heartfelt angui&s;h.</P>
<P>The next day I determined again to try my new employment, and for that purpo&s;e wandered out towards the park. It was Sun|day, the day was fine, I went in and &s;eating my&s;elf on a bench, looked at the gay throng that crowded the mall, compared their &s;itua|tions with my own, and began to think my|&s;elf the mo&s;t unfortunate of human beings. I knew I had never deviated from the path of virtue; I had never committed any ac|tion de&s;erving &s;uch abject mi&s;ery, and I &s;aw many women who had forfeited all claim to honour and re&s;pect, enjoying all the luxuries of life. At that moment rea&s;on, religion, in|tegrity for&s;ook me; and I wi&s;hed my&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;ituation with tho&s;e victims to vice, if by &s;o doing, I could procure &s;u&s;tenance for my mother.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps a&s;k, my dear Celia, if we had no friends whatever, to whom we could apply for relief; alas! my dear girl, you
<PB N="27" REF="029439_0202_0FE113B6344F1148">
know nothing of the world; tho&s;e who have drank deep of the cup of affliction can tell, that poverty and friend&s;hip are utter &s;tran|gers to each other. While I was indulging the&s;e painful reflections, an elderly gentle|woman, &s;eated her&s;elf be&s;ide me, and view|ing my per&s;on and dre&s;s with a &s;crutinizing eye, began &s;ome trifling di&s;cour&s;e, and at length a&s;ked me, if I was born in London. From chatting at fir&s;t on indifferent &s;ubjects, we began to remark the different appear|ances of the pa&s;&s;ing multitude. The old lady's remarks were ju&s;t and pertinent; her di&s;|cour&s;e breathed the true &s;pirit of philanthro|py. I imagined I had found a friend, and without re&s;erve unbo&s;omed my&s;elf to her; related my &s;tory of pa&s;t and pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he heard me with attention, and, me thought, I &s;aw a gleam of compa&s;&s;ion pa&s;s acro&s;s her features. I &s;eized the propitious moment, and in the humble&s;t accent peti|tioned relief.</P>
<P>"Poor child," &s;aid &s;he, "I believe your &s;tory to be true; innocence and &s;implicity, are indeliably marked upon your counte|nance; what is in my power I will do for you, tho' the means are but &s;mall." She then drew forth her pur&s;e, and pre&s;ented me with half a crown: it is only for tho&s;e who have been in &s;imilar circum&s;tances to
<PB N="28" REF="029439_0203_0FE113BBA991FBA8">
concieve the tide of joy that ru&s;hed upon my heart at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this little piece of &s;ilver; I eagerly ki&s;&s;ed the hand that conveyed it to me, and would have &s;poke, but tears were the only thanks I could re|turn; they were the &s;incere&s;t, for they came warm from the heart.</P>
<P>I left my &s;eat with precipitation, and was preparing to return home; but my bene|factre&s;s &s;topped me. "Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid &s;he, "I believe I have it my power to &s;erve you; meet me here again to-morrow." I promi&s;ed to meet her and returned to my mother with a heart lightened of half its &s;orrows. No doubt, &s;aid I, this lady will endeavour to extricate us from our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, and put us in &s;ome way of earning future &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Elated with the&s;e hopes, I repaired next day to the appointed place; but after hav|ing waited two hours was obliged to return without &s;eeing my benefactre&s;s. Something has detained her unexpectedly, &s;aid I, &s;he will undoubtedly come to-morrow: but to|morrow pa&s;&s;ed as ye&s;terday had done, and I was again di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The third morning, tho' I had u&s;ed the mo&s;t rigid economy, I found my&s;elf again penny|le&s;s.
<PB N="29" REF="029439_0204_0FE1083C210D3268">
However, &s;piritle&s;s and mi&s;erable as I was, I determined once more to repair to the park. My pace was &s;low, my looks dejected and my eyes &s;treaming with tears. I had hardly proceeded half the length of the mall, when I heard my&s;elf called, and turning round perceived my benefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>"My good girl," &s;aid &s;he, "I almo&s;t feared I &s;hould not meet you, I have been obliged to go into the country &s;ince I &s;aw you, but I had not forgot you; come dry your eyes, I have met with a gentleman who will be your friend, if you mind how you behave your&s;elf. He has &s;ent you half a guinea; and if you will come this evening and &s;up at my hou&s;e, in Soho &s;quare, I will introduce you to him."</P>
<P>"Alas! madam," &s;aid I, "my appear|ance at your hou&s;e will only di&s;grace you; nor can I &s;uppo&s;e any gentleman will greatly intere&s;t him&s;elf in behalf of a poor unfortu|nate girl, without requiring a return which virtue and religion will not &s;uffer me to make."</P>
<P>"Don't be fooli&s;h, child," &s;aid the old lady, "virtue and religion are very pretty words; but pray tell me, will they keep your mother from &s;tarving."</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="029439_0205_0FE113C61FE377A8">
"Oh! madam," I replied, "will it not be wor&s;e than death to brand her name with in|famy? Alas! I never could bear the &s;corn of the world, and the reproofs of my own con&s;cience, oppre&s;&s;ed with guilt and &s;hame. Tempt me not, dear madam, to for&s;ake the path of rectitude; let me retain my inno|cence, and come what may, I &s;hall die in peace."</P>
<P>"This is fine talking, Mi&s;s Howard, but let me tell you, it is a very &s;elfi&s;h way of ar|guing. You acknowledge, that the lo&s;s of virtue would make you unhappy. Are you not already unhappy in a &s;uperlative degree; and does that unhappine&s;s in the lea&s;t con|tribute to relieve your own or your mother's wants. No, does not the &s;ight of your mi|&s;ery rather increa&s;e hers? Come, then, my dear girl, act the heroine, take this load of &s;orrow upon your&s;elf, and &s;ave a parent, whom you tenderly love, from peri&s;hing with famine."</P>
<P>This was a &s;trange way of arguing, Celia, yet it had the de&s;ired effect, I thought it was po&s;&s;ible to hide my infamy from my mother, and confine my mi&s;ery to my own bo&s;om. When the old woman found my re&s;olution began to waver, &s;he plied me with &s;ophi&s;ti|cal arguments, de&s;cribed in glowing colours
<PB N="31" REF="029439_0206_0FE113CA77F9A2B8">
the gaiety and &s;plendor in which many wo|men of loo&s;e characters lived, and contra&s;t|ed it &s;trongly with my poor mi&s;erable apart|ment, where my &s;ure attendants were pinch|ing cold and hunger, and my only companion a beloved parent &s;inking under the compli|cated evils of &s;ickne&s;s and famine.</P>
<P>"Oh! &s;ave me! &s;ave me!" cried I ea|gerly, "from the dreadful thought, teach me how to &s;natch her from impending de|&s;truction, to admini&s;ter &s;upport to her wa&s;t|ing frame, and comfort her declining hours. Do with me as you will; &s;ave, protect my dear mother, and let me be the only &s;acri|fice."</P>
<P>Having brought me to this horrible re&s;o|lution, and recieved my promi&s;e of coming to her hou&s;e in the evening; &s;he left me, and I repaired home; by the way procuring a bottle of wine and &s;ome other nece&s;&s;aries for my mother. She had been anxious at my long &s;tay, and when I produced the re|fre&s;hments, again enquired how I had pur|cha&s;ed them. A lie, (the fir&s;t I had ever told her) now &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf; I &s;aid I had performed a little work for a lady in the neighbourhood, and &s;he had liberally re|warded me; but when I mentioned going out again in the evening, the pathetic man|ner
<PB N="32" REF="029439_0207_0FE113D01A5CEE90">
in which &s;he intreated me to guard my honour, as my only trea&s;ure, and as I wi&s;h|ed to pre&s;erve her heart from breaking, almo&s;t &s;taggered my re&s;olution: but having given her &s;ome refre&s;hment, I &s;aw her &s;pi|rits revive, and that by degrees &s;he &s;unk in|to a &s;weet refre&s;hing &s;lumber. I determined to &s;acrifice every other con&s;ideration rather than &s;ee her reduced again to the extremity of mi&s;ery &s;he had &s;o lately experienced.</P>
<P>Oh! ye rigidly virtuous of my own &s;ex, turn not from me with horror and contempt, con&s;ider my agonizing di&s;tre&s;s, glance with an eye of compa&s;&s;ion over the dreadful re&s;o|lution, and let a tear of pity blot the offence from your memories.</P>
<P>Great and painful were the &s;truggles of my &s;oul, while gazing on my &s;leeping pa|rent. I knelt by the bed&s;ide, and would have prayed, but, alas! that con&s;olation was denied me. How could I addre&s;s a Being of infinite purity, when I was going to offer my&s;elf a &s;acrifice at the &s;hrine of guilt and pollution. I thought I &s;hould have &s;unk un|der the agonies I endured; once I wi&s;hed for death, but then the thought of what my poor mother would &s;uffer, immediately re|pelled the impious de&s;ire; at length, I cla&s;p|ed my hands and rai&s;ing my eyes to hea|ven,
<PB N="33" REF="029439_0208_0FE113D359E34DD8">
cried, "Father of mercy direct me, oh! give me fortitude to bear thy di&s;pen&s;ations as I ought, or pardon the weakne&s;s of an afflicted mortal." I then ki&s;&s;ed my &s;leeping mother, and with a heart almo&s;t broken re|paired to Soho.</P>
<P>The old woman received me cordially, but reproved my pen&s;ive countenance and &s;wolen eyes; &s;he made me drink &s;ome tea, and then taking me up &s;tair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, in&s;i&s;ted on my dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf in a brown lute&s;tring night|gown, with a cap and linen &s;uitable. We then went into an elegant parlour, and in a few moments Mr. Welldon was announced: he was a man upwards of thirty, of a come|ly per&s;on, polite addre&s;s, and in&s;inuating manner; he regarded me with vi&s;ible atten|tion, and when he &s;poke to me, it was with a mixture of re&s;pect and polite freedom. My feelings during &s;upper were beyond de|&s;cription, poignant: I could &s;carcely re&s;train my tears, but the reproving looks of the old woman told me how much they would offend her: I therefore endeavoured to &s;tifle my emotions; but when the cloth was re|moved and &s;he aro&s;e to quit the room, I in|voluntarily caught her hand, and with a look which pleaded &s;trongly for compa&s;&s;ion bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="029439_0209_0FE113D9C1817B98">
"Why, what does the girl cry for?" &s;aid &s;he &s;neeringly, "was it not by your own de|&s;ire you came here? come, Mr. Welldon, you mu&s;t get the better of the&s;e pretty airs, tho' perhaps, indeed you may think her the more agreeable for them." Then di&s;engaging her hand from my gra&s;p, &s;he left the room.</P>
<P>"Then I am inevitably lo&s;t," cried I, cla&s;ping my hands in a wild agony, and re|doubling my tears. "My &s;weet girl," &s;aid Mr. Welldon, "this di&s;tre&s;s, which is too acute, to be con&s;trued into affectation, great|ly &s;upri&s;es me. Was it not by your own free will that you came here to meet me?"</P>
<P>"It was, it was," &s;aid I, "but oh! &s;ir, if you only knew the angui&s;h it has co&s;t me, to form the horrid de&s;ign, you would pity me, indeed you would commi&s;erate my &s;uf|ferings."</P>
<P>"Dear creature," &s;aid he, drawing his chair clo&s;e to mine, "you know not how greatly your &s;orrow intere&s;ts me; tell me, is there any thing within the compa&s;s of my fortune, can re&s;tore peace to your agitated bo&s;om; &s;ay how can I &s;erve you, how ren|der you happy?"</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="029439_0210_0FE113DCE4ED8978">
"Oh! there is one way, and only one way," &s;aid I, "by which you can promote my happine&s;s," and I dropped on my knees before him. "Ri&s;e, ri&s;e, my dear girl," &s;aid he, "and do not he&s;itate to point out this only way, by which I can prove my&s;elf your friend."</P>
<P>"This humliating po&s;ture be&s;t &s;uits me," I replied, "here will I remain till I move your heart to compa&s;&s;ion: indeed I am not that vile creature you may perhaps think me. I always avoided the inticements of vice till this fatal night; but the mi&s;eries of a beloved parent, &s;inking to the grave, op|pre&s;&s;ed by &s;ickne&s;s and poverty drove me to &s;acrifice my honour, to procure the means of prolonging her invaluable exi&s;t|ence: if you are &s;incere in your profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, relieve my dear mother, and oh! I be&s;ceeh you, &s;pare the virtue of her wretched daughter."</P>
<P>"Ri&s;e, then, my afflicted girl," &s;aid he, "you &s;hall be convinced of my &s;incerity; I will obey the dictates of humanity; we will in&s;tantly go to your mother." He then left me for a few moments, when returning, he led me to a coach, and taking my direction, ordered the coachman to drive to our poor habitation. I he&s;itated at going away in the
<PB N="36" REF="029439_0211_0FE113E36BE4A608">
cloaths the old woman had made me put on, but my deliverer told me he had paid for them.</P>
<P>When we arrived at our lodging, a mix|ed &s;en&s;ation of pain and plea&s;ure dwelt upon my mind, and as I ran up &s;tairs my limbs trembled &s;o, they would &s;carce &s;upport me; Mr. Welldon followed me up: I opened the door of the apartment, and ru&s;hing to the bed&s;ide, cried "&s;ee my dear mother, the friend which heaven hath &s;ent us." My poor mother rai&s;ed her&s;elf feebly in the bed, looked fir&s;t at me, then at Mr. Welldon, then pointing to my altered dre&s;s and crying "the&s;e are the wages of infamy, all but this I could have born patiently." She fell back in a fit.</P>
<P>I thought &s;he was gone forever; frantic with de&s;pair, I tore off the dre&s;s which had &s;o much alarmed her, and throwing my&s;elf on the bed be&s;ide her, vowed never more to ri&s;e, but that my life &s;hould expiate my intend|ed offence. Mr. Welldon had ran away for medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and entered the room with an apothecary, ju&s;t as my mother gave &s;ome &s;igns of returning life. Proper reme|dies were immediately applied and Mr. Well|don &s;oon convinced my reviving parent, that I had not entailed infamy on her latter days, or ha&s;tened the period of her exi&s;tence by guilt or &s;hame.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="029439_0212_0FE113E66277A390">
Our generous benefactor, now &s;upplied me with money, not only to procure every nece&s;&s;ary, but every comfort of life; and engaged the apothecary to attend my mo|ther every day: but his care was all in vain; her di&s;order daily gained ground, and I &s;aw her end rapidly approaching. One day, when Mr. Welldon called to &s;ee us, my mother beckoned him to the bed&s;ide. "Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "if the prayers of a poor dying mortal are heard in heaven, you will un|doubtedly be rewarded for your benevo|lence, towards a helple&s;s widow and orphan. To your genero&s;ity I owe the honour of my child: oh! may &s;he never again be tempt|ed to doubt the care of a watchful provi|dence; and to avoid a temporary evil, ru&s;h into la&s;ting mi&s;ery. To your care Mr. Well|don I commit her, poor and defencele&s;s as &s;he is; I do not fear your integrity; for the man, who in the gay hour of uncontrouled pa&s;&s;ion could &s;ave an innocent creature from de&s;truction, will never lay a deliberate plan for her &s;eduction. Meriel, you mu&s;t be humble and indu&s;trious, and tru&s;t heaven for &s;upport." Mr. Welldon promi&s;ed he would be my guardian and protector from every evil. "I place an implicit confidence in your word," &s;aid my mother, "and &s;hall die in peace."</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="029439_0213_0FE113EC7B718F50">
"Oh! my dear Meriel," continued &s;he, faintly gra&s;ping my hand, "may&s;t thou be virtuous and happy, and may the Omnipo|tent pre&s;erve thee thro' life."</P>
<P>Celia, I feel I am unable to proceed, the moment that &s;evered me from my dear mo|ther will be always remembered as the mo&s;t painful of my life. Adieu till I am more compo&s;ed.</P>

<P>I AGAIN &s;it down to proceed in my me|lancholy narrative; a month from the time of my dear mother's death mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;|ed over in &s;ilence; my affliction was poig|nant, but time and the efforts of rea&s;on by degrees &s;oftened it. Mr. Welldon &s;uffered that time to elap&s;e before he ventu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to &s;ee me; he had placed me with a friend of his, who is a milliner, and tho' he &s;ent every day to enquire after my health, he avoided vi&s;iting me, fearing the cen&s;ure of the world might injure my reputation. My grief being in a great mea&s;ure abated, Mrs. Lacour took an opportunity of &s;peaking to me concerning my future pro&s;pects in life: "Mr. Welldon," &s;aid &s;he, "intends, if you approve the plan, that you &s;hall remain with me till you have attained a competent know|ledge
<PB N="40" REF="029439_0215_0FE113F63B5433B0">
of the millinery bu&s;ine&s;s, to be able to &s;upport your&s;elf without being any longer trouble&s;ome to your benefactor. I know, Mi&s;s Howard," continued &s;he, "that Mr. Welldon, does not think you an incum|brance, and that you are in no danger of any improper attempts from him; as I have heard him &s;ay the innate goodne&s;s of your heart has rai&s;ed you &s;o in his e&s;teem, that he regards you in the light of a &s;i&s;ter; and as &s;uch will &s;erve and protect you: but my dear young lady, you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility and to &s;uch a heart as your's de|pendance mu&s;t be a heavy burthen. As another motive for your endeavouring to render your&s;elf independent, I mu&s;t inform you that Mr. Welldon will in a few weeks be married, and however innocent your mind, believe me the world will readily ca&s;t illiberal cen&s;ures on a young woman who lived in a &s;tate of dependance on a married man; and &s;hould it reach his lady's ears might be the &s;ource of great unea&s;ine&s;s, if not the cau&s;e of an irreparable breach be|tween them."</P>
<P>I was convinced of the propriety of the&s;e arguments, and chearfully acquie&s;ced, while my heart overflowed with gratitude towards my generous benefactor, and I breathed a &s;ilent prayer to heaven, that his felicity in
<PB N="41" REF="029439_0216_0FE113FAE1AE15E8">
the married &s;tate might be equal to his de|&s;erts.</P>
<P>A few days after this, Mr. Welldon call|ed. I could not refrain my tears at &s;ight of this worthy man. Pa&s;t &s;cenes of &s;orrow ru&s;hed upon my mind, which joined to the recollection of my then forlorn, dependant &s;ituation almo&s;t overcame me. He &s;uffered me to ea&s;e my full heart, and then gently enquiring after my health, and how I liked Mrs. Lacour's family, hinted at my remain|ing with her, till I had attained a competent knowledge of her bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"I know, my dear Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid he, "that your education and accompli&s;h|ments fit you to be placed in a more elevated &s;phere. But my good girl mu&s;t con&s;ider that tho&s;e accompli&s;hments in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances will be of no u&s;e. Nay, if they are &s;uffered to appear will only excite the envy and ill nature of tho&s;e with whom &s;he is at pre&s;ent obliged to a&s;&s;ociate. I would by no means have you neglect tho&s;e brilliant talents, with which nature has endowed you. It is not to be doubted, but you will find lei|&s;ure hours when the pen or the pencil will be a happy relief to your mind, and prevent your dwelling too intently on pa&s;t melan|choly events. But let tho&s;e hours of relax|ation
<PB N="42" REF="029439_0217_0FE114004C2511E0">
be but few, above all things, be care|ful not to let your companions di&s;cover the &s;uperiority you certainly po&s;&s;e&s;s over them. Educated, as you have been, perhaps you may think, that with great propriety you might undertake the education of children in &s;ome family of di&s;tinction, or become com|panion to &s;ome lady. I acknowledge, my fair friend, the&s;e are the &s;ituations for which you &s;eem mo&s;t adapted, but here an in&s;ur|mountable ob&s;tacle ari&s;es; you have no fe|male friend who can recommend you; and the recommendation of a man, in the&s;e ca&s;es, in general injures the per&s;on they mean to &s;erve. You mu&s;t, therefore, apply your&s;elf attentively to your new profe&s;&s;ion, and place a firm reliance on Providence to reward your indu&s;try with &s;ucce&s;s."</P>
<P>I had never attempted to interrupt Mr. Welldon, during this friendly harrangue, but finding he now continued &s;ilent, I endea|voured, as well as my tears would permit, to convince him of my gratitude, by promi&s;ing to do every thing which he had enjoined.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lacour was now de&s;ired to come in, when all terms having been previou&s;ly agreed on, he paid my apprentice fee, and it was determined I &s;hould remain with her twelve
<PB N="43" REF="029439_0218_0FE114045E81FB78">
months. Mr. Welldon then told me he had provided me an apartment to my&s;elf, and begged my acceptance of the furniture it contained. "This day three weeks, Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid he, "will make me the hap|pie&s;t of men in a union with a young lady of great merit, on whom I have de&s;ervedly placed my affections. We &s;hall &s;et off im|mediately on a vi&s;it to the continent to &s;ee &s;ome relations, who re&s;ide con&s;tantly in the &s;outh of France, &s;o that it may be a long time before I &s;ee you again. In this little pocket-book you will find a trifle to an&s;wer your immediate expences, and a direction to a gentleman, in the city, where in ca&s;e of any future exigencies, you may apply, and he will give you both a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice. God ble&s;s you, my dear girl; you have my be&s;t wi&s;hes, and may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of my un|alterable friend&s;hip." He then &s;aluted me with the affection of a brother, and took his leave.</P>
<P>Soon after he was gone, Mrs. Lacour, by way of diverting my mind from the gloom our parting had ca&s;t over it, a&s;ked me if I had no curio&s;ity to &s;ee the apartment Mr. Welldon had furni&s;hed for me. I followed her up two pair of &s;tairs, into a neat back room, where was a tent bed, of &s;triped Man|che&s;ter, with every nece&s;&s;ary apurtenance,
<PB N="44" REF="029439_0219_0FE11409865BEE00">
a ca&s;e of drawers, a neat dre&s;&s;ing ca&s;e, and a &s;mall trunk, the key of which Mrs. La|cour gave me, and bidding me with a &s;mile examine my trea&s;ures, went down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>On opening the trunk I found it contained a piece of grey lute&s;tring, two pieces of dark chintz, each enough for a gown, about ten yards of mu&s;lin, and a piece of fine linen. Removing the&s;e, I di&s;covered at the bottom, a neat edition of the Engli&s;h poets, together with a bible and common prayer book; here al&s;o, I found a roll of drawing paper, which led me to imagine I was &s;upplied with other materials for this elegant amu&s;ement, and on opening the drawers, I found I had not been deceived in my conjectures; for there I found a box of crayons, pencils and colours, and a leather writing ca&s;e, in which was a letter of truely brotherly advice. On open|ing a light clo&s;et that adjoined my bed cham|ber, I di&s;covered another mark of the friend|ly attention of my benefactor; for there was a &s;mall piano forte, with a collection of mu&s;ic by the be&s;t ma&s;ters. My little pocket-book contained a bank note for fifty pounds.</P>
<P>Oppre&s;&s;ed by a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e numerous obligations, my heart almo&s;t bur&s;ting with grateful emotions, I &s;unk on my knees by the bed &s;ide, and poured forth my thanks
<PB N="45" REF="029439_0220_0FE1140C6DB5DFB0">
to the great Di&s;po&s;er of all things, entreat|ed that the choice&s;t of his ble&s;&s;ings might be &s;howered on my benefactor, and prayed his mercy ever to protect and direct me, nor &s;uffer me again, impiou&s;ly to doubt his power and watchful care.</P>
<P>The next morning, I entered on my new employment with alacrity. It is an employ|ment that keeps the mind continually amu&s;|ed. Mrs. Lacour is an amiable, chearful woman, and &s;ome of her young people, &s;en|&s;ible, well informed girls. I do not like Mr. Lacour: he appears to me a pert, illite|rate coxcomb. But this does not give me any great unea&s;ine&s;s, as I am not much in his company, except at meal times. When the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day is fini&s;hed, I retire to my own apartment, where writing, reading or mu&s;ic, &s;weetly relaxes and chears my mind: the time never hangs heavy; I feel a charming &s;erenity pervade my heart, and Hope, that bright cele&s;tial gue&s;t, again has taken up her re&s;idence in my bo&s;om. On a Sundy evening, I never fail vi&s;iting the dear &s;pot, that contains all that was earthly of my beloved mother. I cannot de&s;cribe my &s;en&s;ations when I approach the place. They are far from painful Celia, for the remembrance of her piety and virtue is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alm to my heart; and while my eye i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

fixed on the grave where &s;he lies, my mental faculties behold her ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit beatifi|ed, and enjoying the fullne&s;s of heavenly bli&s;s in that man&s;ion, where, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, I &s;hall one day again embrace her. When I re|turn from the&s;e contemplations, my &s;oul is &s;o attuned to harmony, that I &s;ing the hymns or anthems &s;uited to the day, with a plea|&s;ure unde&s;cribable. I have wrote a few lines, which you will find fully expre&s;&s;ive of the frame of my mind. I cannot help regreting, my deare&s;t friend, the happy days I &s;pent with you in the convent, tho' all-chearing Hope bids me look forward; and while I take my pre&s;ent lot with grati|tude, humbly a&s;pire to a ble&s;&s;ed hereafter. Enclo&s;ed are the lines I mention; I &s;ing it to that &s;weet plaintive air, we were both &s;o fond of.

<P>THERE is in this family a Mademoi&s;elle Bagatelle, who is Mrs. Lacour's fore|woman; I do not like her, Celia, &s;he dre&s;&s;es in the extremity of the fa&s;hion, takes &s;nuff&punc; rouges high, and is high in the good graces of Mon&s;ieur Lacour. I can perceive they perfectly under&s;tand each other, tho' the prudent wife either does not, or will not, &s;ee the intimacy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them.</P>
<P>It has often been a &s;ubject of wonder to me, how people, who&s;e tempers and di&s;po&s;i|tions are the very rever&s;e of each other, could voluntarily put on the hymeneal yoke together; and yet we daily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee in&s;tances of &s;en&s;e and folly; virtue and vice; under|&s;tanding and ignorance; politene&s;s and vul|garity; youth and age; beauty and defor|mity,
<PB N="49" REF="029439_0224_0FE1141F9115DEF0">
being linked in the &s;ame chain: nay, what is more &s;urpri&s;ing that both parties eagerly put it on. How are we to account for the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies in human nature, nothing can be more oppo&s;ite than the di&s;|po&s;itions of Mon&s;leur and Mrs. Lacour, and yet I have been told that it was a marriage of inclination and on the lady's &s;ide, entirely again&s;t the approbation of her friends; hence we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that either love throws a mi&s;t over the di&s;cerning optics of its votaries, or that their is a fate in marri|age, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to counteract.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps, wonder, my dear Ce|lia, that among the many long epi&s;tles I have lately wrote to you, the name of Rains|forth has never e&s;caped me: indeed, I have had afflictions of &s;o much heavier a nature, than merely the lo&s;s of a lover, that &s;ome months pa&s;&s;ed in which I hardly remembered there was &s;uch a per&s;on in being: however in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, being more ea&s;y in my mind, thought has frequently recurred to the period when I expected to have been united to him by indi&s;&s;oluble ties. When I think of him, I am feelingly convinced that my heart is &s;till attached; I almo&s;t doubt the intelligence of his infidelity, tho' con|veyed to me by the hand of his father: I feel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;tle&s;s curio&s;ity to be informed of his

happine&s;s; I fancy, &s;ometimes that he might have heard reports to my di&s;advantage; he might have been informed of my unfortu|nate elopement, of my thoughtle&s;s corre|&s;pondence with Pringle: every circum&s;tance may have been exaggerated; and he may not be &s;o culpable as I at fir&s;t thought him. The&s;e ideas often crowd my imagination. But he is married, Celia, and let his virtues be ever &s;o briliant, he can be nothing to me.</P>
<P>I have heard by mere accident that my brother is in a fair way of making his for|tune in India; I have wrote to him &s;everal times, but recieved no an&s;wer; not even a line has arrived from him, &s;ince the bill, which I mentioned in a former letter, was paid. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's family are I find removed into the country, and as to any of tho&s;e who called them&s;elves my friends in the day of pro&s;perity, if I meet them now they &s;tare me confidently in the face, but do not in the lea&s;t recollect me. Mrs. Lacour, tells me, that when fortune removes friends to any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other, the party who is the favourite of the fickle god|de&s;s almo&s;t immediately becomes near-&s;ight|ed, and is afflicted with a &s;hort memory.</P>

<P>I was ye&s;terday &s;ent to wait on a lady with &s;ome caps, &amp;c. in St. James's &s;quare. When having waited about half an hour in a cold empty parlour, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, but could not recollect who&s;e it was. I was &s;triving to call it to my memory in vain, when the door opened, and who &s;hould I behold but Mi&s;s Pringle, and another young lady. "Come into this room young woman," &s;aid &s;he, "here is a fire, and we will look over your trumpery." I went in my heart &s;inking as I moved; for I knew enough of this once affectionate friend to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would not readily acknowledge an acquaintance with a milliner's apprentice. I &s;aw, the moment &s;he ca&s;t her eyes on me, &s;he recollected me; but as I did not wi&s;h to &s;hew an incli|nation to renew our acquaintance, I ca&s;t down my eyes and remained &s;ilent, think|ing that if &s;he did not choo&s;e to take notice of me, &s;he might &s;ettle it within her&s;elf that I did not know her. But the lady's curio&s;ity was more predominent than her pride. She looked at me &s;everal times and at length cried "if I did not think it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble I &s;hould &s;ay your name was Howard." "My name is Howard, ma'am," &s;aid I cold|ly. "Why, &s;ure as I am alive, it is Meriel
<PB N="52" REF="029439_0227_0FE1142D73272B48">
Howard." "The very &s;ame, Mi&s;s Pringle." "La! my dear girl, why how came you in this &s;ituation, &s;uch a fortune as you had left you." "We are all &s;ubject to vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune," &s;aid I &s;miling, "but I am ex|tremely happy in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation."</P>
<P>"Happy!" &s;aid &s;he, lifting up her eyes in &s;urprize. "I am a&s;toni&s;hed to hear you &s;ay &s;o, for my part I &s;hould be the mo&s;t mi&s;era|ble creature on earth, was I reduced to car|ry a band-box." "Happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, Mi&s;s," &s;aid I, "are in general the re&s;ult of our own ideas: if I am content in my hum|ble &s;tation, I am in my own mind as happy, nay, perhaps happier than the woman, who riding in a chariot and pair, envies one who&s;e &s;uperior fortune can command four or &s;ix hor&s;es."</P>
<P>She did not &s;eem to comprehend me, but turning to the other lady, &s;aid, "well I vow &s;i&s;ter it is very a&s;toni&s;hing; but this young woman, only four years ago, had a fortune of four thou&s;and pounds, her father liv|ed in the neighbourhood of our country-hou&s;e. My brother was very fond of her once, and I believe &s;he did not altogether di&s;like him, did you Meriel? I fancy your little heart never regained its liberty."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="029439_0228_0FE11432152C78A0">
"I rather &s;uppo&s;e, Mi&s;s Pringle, that it never was a captive. If at one time I was fooli&s;h enough to fancy my&s;elf in love with your brother, it was before I had the power of di&s;tingui&s;hing a real from an ideal pa&s;&s;ion, or before I was a competent judge of what would be mo&s;t conducive to my own happi|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Aye," &s;aid &s;he, "you can talk of it with a great deal of compo&s;ure now, but you cer|tainly was very fond of him once or you would not have re&s;olved to run away with him; nay, can you deny that you were out of your &s;en&s;es about him, when you heard he was married."</P>
<P>This cruel reflection on my unfortunate malady, which was occa&s;ioned by the &s;ever|e&s;t affliction that ever child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, was more than my &s;pirits could &s;upport, I turned my face from her to to hide the tear&punc; that tric|kled fa&s;t from my eyes; but could not com|mand my voice to give her an an&s;wer, when &s;he continued: "Well, but where are Mr. and Mrs. Howard, and ma&s;ter Richard?" "My brother is in India&mdash;I have no parents."</P>
<P>"Poor, dear girl," &s;aid the other young lady, now &s;peaking for the fir&s;t time, "that is a dreadful thing. I know what it is to
<PB N="54" REF="029439_0229_0FE1143763347380">
have no parents." She took my hand, and I &s;aw her mild eyes gli&s;ten with compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed to put an end to this painful conver&s;ation, and therefore de&s;ired to know if they would keep any of the caps. "Oh, yes, I &s;hall have &s;everal, but &s;top Meriel, I mu&s;t let my mother know you are here. Dear, how &s;he will be &s;urprized; and you &s;hall go down to Baker, &s;he will pay you, and do have a gla&s;s of wine before you go, and a bit of bride cake: you don't know I am married."</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h you much happine&s;s madam," &s;aid I, coldly; "but I cannot &s;tay to take any refre&s;hment: I have been here much longer than I ought to have &s;taid." You mu&s;t know, my dear Celia, that my pride was hurt at the idea of &s;tanding fir&s;t to be catechi&s;ed by the mother, and then be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed to the hou&s;e-keeper for wine and cake; and this treatment from a girl, who once called her&s;elf my friend, and thought her&s;elf honoured by the title. However, I could not e&s;cape; the mother was called, and the bell rang for Mrs. Baker. I an|&s;wered Mrs. Pringle's que&s;tions in as &s;hort a manner as po&s;&s;ible; but ob&s;tinately re|fu&s;ed going down with the hou&s;e-keeper. "Ah! poor girl," &s;aid Mrs. Pringle, in an

affected whi&s;per to her daughter; "let the wine be brought up, my dear; you &s;ee &s;he cannot as yet &s;ubmit to the alteration in her &s;ituation."</P>
<P>"You are mi&s;taken madam," &s;aid I, "I do not feel the lea&s;t embara&s;&s;ment from the reflection that I owe my &s;upport to in|du&s;try: it is what many, more worthy than my&s;elf are obliged to do, it is by no means hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">liating. True dignity is &s;eated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;oul, nor can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ituation make me forget the re&s;pect eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> due to my&s;elf. I cannot but reflect ladies, that I am the &s;ame Mi&s;s Howard, whom &s;ome few years ago, you were &s;o extremely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ond of, and eagerly &s;triving which could &s;hew her the mo&s;t re|&s;pect. Tho' I am now bereaved of that for|tune, which I percieve was the magnet which attracted your attentions. I can make proper di&s;tinctions; as a trades per&s;on, I can ea&s;ily &s;ubmit to be turned over to your hou&s;e-keeper for payment, but remember|ing I have once been your companion, am &s;till your equal, I cannot &s;ubmit to be placed on a level with your &s;ervants."</P>
<P>They could not an&s;wer. Shame and a&s;toni&s;hment tied their tongues. I curt&s;ied &s;lightly and followed Mrs. Baker out of the room. While &s;he was paying me, the lo|quacious
<PB N="56" REF="029439_0231_0FE114417585ACE8">
hou&s;e-keeper informed me that her ma&s;ter had been married about three weeks; that he never &s;aw Mi&s;s Pringle till within a month of their union; that he danced with her at a ball, and was &s;truck with her plea&s;|ing per&s;on, and in&s;inuating manner; "but I can &s;ee," continued &s;he, "it will not be a very happy union; and Mi&s;s Sally, poor girl, will be more unhappy than ever. It was a &s;ad thing, &s;ir John left her depend|ant on her brother." "What then," &s;aid I, "your ma&s;ter is a baronet?" "No," &s;aid &s;he, "his father was a knight, but the title died with him. He was a wealthy citizen, and was knignted for carrying an addre&s;s to the king on &s;ome particular occa|&s;ion." I had now received my money, and not wi&s;hing to pry into the &s;ecrets of a fami|ly, with whom I de&s;ired not to form any connection, I wi&s;hed Mrs. Baker a good morning, and left the hou&s;e. In the hall I met Mi&s;s Sally. "You will have a long walk Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid &s;he; "had I any command here, you &s;hould not carry that heavy box."</P>
<P>"It is not heavy, Mi&s;s," &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"But it is cumber&s;ome," &s;he replied, "and you are not accu&s;tomed to &s;uch employment." She then opened the door
<PB N="57" REF="029439_0232_0FE1144468EBB540">
her&s;elf, and &s;miling, with a &s;weet look of benevolence, wi&s;hed me a good morning. I pitied the dear girl, for &s;ure I am, if &s;he is dependant on her brother, her new &s;i&s;ter will not contribute to make her life very comfortable.</P>
<P>As I walked home, I could not avoid re|flecting on this rencounter with Mi&s;s Prin|gle; nor did my heart entirely approve my own conduct: there was too much pride in the manner in which I &s;poke to her: in|deed, &s;ince I have been poor, Celia, I have di&s;covered that I am very proud, much more &s;o than is becoming; I will endeavour to correct this error, and in future adapt my &s;entiments to the &s;tation in which it has plea&s;ed Providence to place me.</P>
<P>I have met with many civilities from &s;ome of Mrs. Lacour's cu&s;tomers; e&s;pecially a Mrs. Moreton, who is a woman of very gen|teel fortune, at lea&s;t, if I am to conjecture from the manner in which &s;he lives: &s;he is very fond of poetry, and has advi&s;ed me to endeavour to rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;cription for the pub|lication of tho&s;e poems I formerly mention|ed to you. Mrs. Lacour does not di&s;ap|prove the plan, and I am by this indulging woman, allowed more time to pur&s;ue my favourite &s;tudy, than I &s;hould have met with
<PB N="58" REF="029439_0233_0FE1144E16CAD2D8">
in any other place. I have obtained &s;everal very re&s;pectable names to my &s;ub&s;cription; and have &s;ome cards of propo&s;als printed which I keep in the &s;hop to pre&s;ent to the ladies who con&s;tantly frequent it. I cannot &s;ay, Celia, but it would be much more plea&s;|ing to me, could I obtain a living by the ex|ertion of any of my natural talents, than by following the &s;traight forward path of the plodding woman of bu&s;ine&s;s; be&s;ides I was never de&s;igned for a milliner, I cannot flat|ter, I cannot tell a woman whom age, and other natural defects, have rendered ex|tremely plain, that a full dre&s;s cap with ar|tificial flowers &s;mall handkerchief, and all the gay trappings that belong to the &s;miling &s;ea&s;on of eighteen, will become her face and figure: and yet this is a very nece&s;&s;ary in|gredient in the compo&s;ition of a milliner. I wi&s;h to my heart &s;ome other plan could be &s;truck out, where I &s;hould not be obliged to &s;ay and atte&s;t things &s;o directly contrary to my own opinion.

At the time I made my vi&s;it you were out, waiting on &s;ome ladies: Mrs. Lacour &s;poke of you in the tendere&s;t man|ner, but &s;aid you were by no means calcu|lated for the bu&s;ine&s;s Mr. Welldon had placed you in; her &s;en&s;ibility is very great &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, and her notions &s;o very refined and delicate, &s;he is totally unable to bear the rude and often in&s;ulting manners of many of our cu&s;tomers: be&s;ides, &s;ir, &s;he loves &s;tu|dy too well ever to make any great profici|ent at her needle. Mrs. Lacour being cal|led away, a pert, forward French woman un|dertook to fini&s;h your character: &s;he threw out the mo&s;t malignant a&s;per&s;ions on your conduct in general, &s;aid you had made your|&s;elf the laughing &s;tock of the whole family, that many of the ladies who frequented the &s;hop, di&s;tingui&s;hed you by the appellation of little &s;cribbler: that you were thoughtle&s;s, extravagant, proud, vain, and indolent: and that you had by your artful conduct alienated the affection of mon&s;ieur Lacour from his wife, and in all the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions &s;he wss joined by her companions, who &s;eemed to con&s;ider you only as a fit object of ridicule.</P>

<P><PB N="65" REF="029439_0240_0FE1146A1F974F90">
The reception of this letter made me very unea&s;y, e&s;pecially the part which mentioned the illne&s;s of my kind hearted benefactor: I was grieved al&s;o to find what a bubble I had been to Mademoi&s;elle and all the ap|prentices, as they had all pretended to be greatly plea&s;ed with my writings, and had often &s;aid it was a thou&s;and pities, &s;o bright a genius &s;honld be buried in oblivion: how|ever it opened my eyes to their deceit and flattery; and I determined to be more up|on my guard in future. I felt extremely grateful to Mr. Friendly for the trouble he had taken in writing to me, an&s;wered his letter immediately, promi&s;ed to profit by his advice, and reqne&s;ted to be again favoured with a few lines whenever he &s;hould hear from Mr. Welldon.</P>
<P>From this time I applied my&s;elf with great a&s;&s;iduity to my employment; tho' I could not help noticing a vi&s;ible alteration in Mrs. Lacour's behaviour: &s;he becau&s;e cold and di&s;tant, frequently &s;poke to me in a tone of di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;eemed carefully to avoid my conver&s;ation, except what was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the bu&s;ine&s;s. The apprentices treated me with di&s;re&s;pect, and Mademoi&s;elle aimed at me the mo&s;t pointed &s;arca&s;ms. Things were in this &s;ituation, when one day as I was &s;itting pen&s;ive in a
<PB N="66" REF="029439_0241_0FE114700035BDD0">
little back parlour, where we u&s;ually break|fa&s;ted, I was &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;udden en|trance of Mon&s;ieur Lacour, who began in the u&s;ual &s;train to profe&s;s his admiration, and audaciou&s;ly &s;olicited return of his illicit pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Your in&s;olence &s;ir," &s;aid I, "is in&s;uf|ferable, I can no longer &s;ubmit to it, and if ever again you &s;hock my ears with &s;uch infa|mous &s;olicitations I will inform your much injured wife of your intimacy with Made|moi&s;elle." I then would have left the room but he threw him&s;elf between me and the door, and &s;eizing my hand, impudently &s;wore, my threat proceeded only from jea|lou&s;y. "But come my &s;weet creature," &s;aid he "do not let that make you unea&s;y, I will promi&s;e never to &s;peak to Bagatelle again." He then fell on his knees with a look of lu|dicrous grimace, which at another time would only have made me laugh: but at that time I felt far different &s;en&s;ations. Unable to free my&s;elf from his gra&s;p, and hurt at the mean opinion he entertained of me, all my forti|tude for&s;ook me, and I bur&s;t into tears. At that moment the door opened, and in ru&s;h|ed Mrs. Lacour, Mademoi&s;elle and Mr. Friendly.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="029439_0242_0FE11472B88DD438">
"Oh Meriel!" cried Mrs. Lacour; "I could not have believed"&mdash;She would have fallen to the ground, had I not &s;prang for|ward to catch her as &s;he fainted.</P>
<P>"You &s;ee &s;ir," &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle to Mr. Friendly, as we were &s;upporting Mrs. La|cour to a chair. "You &s;ee &s;ir, I told you only the truth." Mon&s;ieur, in the general confu&s;ion walked unob&s;erved away. My di&s;tre&s;s was very great to &s;ee Mrs. Lacour in this &s;ituation. I feared it might be of dangerous con&s;equence, as &s;he was far ad|vanced in her pregnancy. I &s;upported her in my arms, chafed her temples with Hun|gary water, and on the fir&s;t return of life, begged her not to think me &s;o guilty as I appeared. She &s;hook her head, pu&s;hed me from her, and leaning on Mademoi&s;elle's arm, went out of the room.</P>
<P>I then addre&s;&s;ed Mr. Friendly as a &s;trang|er; for I did not at that time per&s;onally know him; and entreated he would endea|vour to heal this breach between Mrs. La|cour and my&s;elf: "indeed &s;ir," &s;aid I, "&s;he is the only friend I have; I would &s;ooner die than injure her." I then related briefly every thing that had pa&s;t, and fully explain|ed the cau&s;e of the tears he &s;aw me &s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="029439_0243_0FE114788F979F78">
"Appearances are undoubtedly again&s;t you Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid he, "but I am wil|ling to believe you innocent. I am extreme|ly &s;orry there is any di&s;&s;ention between you and Mrs. Lacour, &s;he being as you have ju&s;t remarked, your only friend. I ye&s;ter|day received a letter from Mrs. Welldon, informing me that her hu&s;band died about a fortnight &s;ince. She mentions you as a per&s;on of whom Mr. Welldon &s;poke in his la&s;t moments, and de&s;ires me to give you fifty pounds, to buy mourning; at the &s;ame time &s;he bids me inform you it is the la&s;t you will recieve from her."</P>
<P>I was &s;o overcome, indeed I may &s;ay &s;tu|pified with grief, I was totally unable to an|&s;wer. He &s;aw and I believe pitied my di&s;tre&s;s&punc; and thus continued. "I have added to this little pre&s;ent fifty pounds more; and would advi&s;e you to leave this family immediately, and in &s;ome genteel neigbourhood open a lit|tle &s;hop, endeavour to gain employment; be prudent and indu&s;trious, and I have no doubt of your &s;ucce&s;s; but prithee, good my girl, burn your pens and paper, and believe me, a woman makes as awkward a figure engaged in literary pur&s;uits, as a coun&s;ellor would do &s;eated at a tambour frame or bu&s;ied in a&s;&s;ort|ing colours for embroidery." I promi&s;ed to
<PB N="69" REF="029439_0244_0FE1147BA5FDC0F8">
remember his friendly advice, he paid me the money and took his leave.</P>
<P>I was now anxious to &s;ee Mrs. Lacour but all attempts to that purpo&s;e were fruitle&s;s. I wrote a letter prote&s;ting my innocence and received a verbal an&s;wer by one of the apren|tices that the thing was too plain to admit of any doubt, that &s;he wi&s;hed me well but had no de&s;ire ever to &s;ee me again. I retired to my apartment with a heart overcharged with &s;orrow. At any other time, the death of my benevolent friend Mr. Welldon would have been in it&s;elf a &s;ufficient affliction: but now I had the additional one of knowing I had tho, unintionally, injured the health of a woman, I &s;incerely e&s;teemed, incurred the cen&s;ures of the world, and ca&s;t an indeliable blemi&s;h on my reputation, which it had ever been my &s;tudy to pre&s;erve un&s;ullied. In the&s;e melancholy reflections I pa&s;t the day; in the evening the &s;ervant brought me up a candle and &s;ome &s;upper: but I was too much agi|tated to eat, and went early to bed, tho' I was fully convinced that to &s;leep would be impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock I heard a great bu&s;|tle below, and fearing for Mrs. Lacour I jumped out of bed and opening my chamber door to li&s;ten, plainly heard one of the young
<PB N="70" REF="029439_0245_0FE11481749691F8">
women &s;ay, "&s;he cannot live, the doctor &s;ays it is impo&s;&s;ible." Terrified beyond mea|&s;ure I put on a few cloaths and ran ha&s;tily down &s;tairs, determined at all events to &s;ee this dear &s;ufferer, and by convincing her of my innocence re&s;tore her mind to peace. The danger &s;he was in had thrown the family into &s;uch confu&s;ion, that I found no oppo&s;i|tion made to my entering the appartment. The curtains were clo&s;e drawn round the bed, and there was little light in the room, &s;o that &s;he did not perceive me when I en|tered, I found the agitation of her mind had thrown her into a premature labour, and that the &s;urgeon imagined her life to be in iminent danger. Every other thought was now ab&s;orbed in my anxiety for her. I beck|oned her &s;i&s;ter who was &s;etting by the bed|&s;ide. She came to me, I told her the di&s;tre&s;s of my mind and begged her to believe me not guilty. "Dear Meriel," &s;aid &s;he, "I never thought you &s;o, nor would my poor &s;i&s;ter have ever entertained an idea to your prejudice, had it not been for the in&s;inua|tions of Bagatelle, who has now plainly di&s;|covered the motive which led her &s;o malici|ou&s;ly to a&s;per&s;e your character: however no one can now have a doubt of your inno|cence. Mademoi&s;elle went out about eight this evening, which greatly &s;urpri&s;ed us, as my &s;i&s;ter was &s;o ill. As the evening ad|vanced,
<PB N="71" REF="029439_0246_0FE114845A7D7E80">
her ab&s;cence became more a&s;toni&s;h|ing, and about an hour &s;ince a per&s;on called who had &s;een Bagatelle and the ungrateful Lacour get into a chai&s;e at an inn door and drive off for Dover."</P>
<P>Tho' my heart bled for Mrs. Lacour, I could not but rejoice that this proceeding of theirs was a convicing proof of my inno|cence. I inquired, if this unfortunate wo|man had been informed of their perfidy, and being an&s;wered in the affirmative, and told that the intelligence had precipitated her illne&s;s, I a&s;ked, if I might be permited to &s;peak to her. When &s;he was informed that I was in the room, &s;he called me to her with a faint voice, and taking hold of my hand, &s;aid, "Meriel, forgive me, I have injured you; but I was my&s;elf decieved." She could not &s;ay more, her pains became excruciating, and after continuing many hours in a &s;tate of exqui&s;ite torture, &s;he re|&s;igned her breath, having given birth to a female infant who &s;urvived her mother but a few moments.</P>
<P>Lacour's flight, and his wife's death was &s;oon &s;pread abroad; and it was di&s;covered that he had not only collected all the debts, previous to his departure, but had al&s;o &s;trip|ped the hou&s;e of every thing valuable, &s;o
<PB N="72" REF="029439_0247_0FE1148A105A0130">
that when the creditors brought in their ac|counts, there was not &s;ufficient property to pay five &s;hillings in the pound. Every thing was immediately &s;eized, and the hap|le&s;s Mrs. Lacour would have been obliged to the pari&s;h for a decent funeral, had not her &s;i&s;ter, tho' but in indifferent circum&s;tan|ces and my&s;elf borne the expence between us. When I had paid every nece&s;&s;ary re|&s;pect to the memory of this unfortunate wo|man, I began to think of my own affairs. You may remember my mentioning a Mrs. Moreton, from whom I had recieved many civilities. She lived at a &s;mall village a few miles out of town. To her I applied for ad|vice, in my pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation. She received me with politene&s;s, told me &s;he would exert her&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to &s;erve me and faid &s;he thought I might make my bu&s;ine&s;s an&s;wer very well in Ken&s;ington, where &s;he had many friends to whom &s;he could recommend me. To a heart formed for all the endearing and &s;ocial ties of life, how every little kindne&s;s is received with grati|tude, and how does it feel the attentions even of common civility. I feel my&s;elf grow|ing attached to this Mrs. Moreton, her man|ner is the mo&s;t prepo&s;e&s;&s;ing, her form elle|gant and and &s;he po&s;e&s;&s;es the polite accom|pli&s;hments in an imminent degree. She is the wife of an officer now in India, by whom

&s;he has two lovely children, her man&s;ion is a little terre&s;tial paradi&s;e. Every thing about it is neat, compact, and charming.</P>
<P>I have not as yet met with an apartment to &s;uit me, tho' I have &s;een &s;everal, however it is determined I &s;hall not have a &s;hop but carry on my bu&s;ine&s;s as a chamber milliner.</P>
<P>My heart almo&s;t &s;inks at the idea of a young, unprotected creature like my&s;elf, venturing upon &s;uch a plan, but what can I do, convinced as I am of the impo&s;&s;ibilty of ever doing any thing in the literary way, I &s;hall never more renew my attempts.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t remember the la&s;t words of my dear mother, "be humble, patient and in|du&s;trious, and rely on heaven for &s;upport." Let me have your prayers, my beloved Celia. But I need not a&s;k them, I am &s;ure my &s;weet benevolent friend looks round the whole univer&s;e with an eye of heavenly complacen|cy, and wi&s;hes every bo&s;om as tranquil as her own; and that your happine&s;s may ne|ver be dimini&s;hed, is the fervant prayer of</P>

<P>I AM now &s;ettled in a very neat apart|ment, within about a half a mile of Mrs. Moreton's hou&s;e; the people with whom I lodge appear obliging and friendly, and from the &s;pecimen I have already had, I think I &s;hall obtain a very genteel living, as I have much more work than I can perform my&s;elf, and am obliged to employ &s;everal young women. My Sundays I always &s;pend with Mrs. Moreton, accompanying her to church in the morning, &s;he dines &s;o late, it is impo&s;&s;ible to go in the afternoon. She has introduced me to the family of a Mr. Belger, a man of great genius, and independent fortune: Mrs. Belger is the mo&s;t exqui&s;itely beautiful woman I ever beheld; but &s;he has no accompli&s;hments, nor can I think &s;he has been even decently educated; indeed, I

have heard it whi&s;pered that &s;he is not his wife; however, &s;he goes by his name, does the honours of his table, and has by him a &s;weet little girl, the very image of her beau|tiful mother: this child has more firmly knit the bonds that holds her faithful to its father; but tho' every look, word and action, &s;peaks the ardency and purity of her attachment: he treats her with a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> re&s;pect, which I am &s;ure mu&s;t cut her to the &s;oul: he is civil, polite, but di&s;tant. In this fami|ly I &s;pend many agreeable hours; I think Mr. Belger the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible man I ever conver&s;ed with, indeed, the more I conver&s;e with him the more I am convinced of my own ignorance; he kindly endeavours to in&s;truct me, directs my ta&s;te in the choice of authors, corrects my judgment, and takes great plea&s;ure in improving me in both mu|&s;ic and drawing. To confe&s;s the truth, I have but little time to &s;pare for the&s;e per|&s;uits; but I &s;ometimes &s;teal a few hours from re&s;t to perform my nece&s;&s;ary employ|ments, that I may the next day have a little time to attend to Mr. Belger's in&s;tructions. We cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> agree about religious mat|ters, but I di&s;pute with him, nor have I any doubt of making a convert of him; for at pre&s;ent, my dear Celia, this agreeable man either is or pretends to be an infidel; I ra|ther think it is the latter, for he &s;aid the

other evening he loved to hear my &s;enti|ments delivered with &s;uch charming enthu|&s;ia&s;m, tho' they were in direct oppo&s;ition to his own. I have had &s;ome doubt about the propriety of continuing my intimacy in this family, as Mrs. Belger is &s;uppo&s;ed to be on|ly his mi&s;tre&s;s; but her whole conduct is &s;uch as may call a blu&s;h upon the cheek of many an in&s;olent woman, who looking with mercile&s;s di&s;dain on her poor fallen &s;i&s;ters, &s;miles contemptou&s;ly and thanks hea|ven &s;he is virtuous. Mrs. Belger is a ten|der, exemplary mother, a kind mi&s;tre&s;s to her &s;ervants, a good chri&s;tian, and a meek, obedient, faithful, I had almo&s;t &s;aid wife; but the my&s;tic words have not pa&s;&s;ed that can render her character re&s;pectable in every eye: you will therefore &s;ay, my dear Celia, &s;he is an improper companion for a girl who&s;e reputation has once been doubted, and can|not be regained by a&s;&s;ociating with a woman, who&s;e character is &s;u&s;picious: True, my dear girl, but I feel my&s;elf &s;o attached to the family &s;o grateful for the attentions &s;hewn me, and am &s;o con&s;cious of my own &s;olitary friendle&s;s &s;ituation, that my heart deprived of every affection, every fond hope on which it once re&s;ted, naturally clings to tho&s;e who&s;e kind|ne&s;s &s;ooths its anxieties to re&s;t.</P>

<P>I have been &s;o frightened, my dear Celia, that I believe it will be &s;ometime before I re|cover my&s;elf; and I cannot but con&s;ider it a great mercy that I am alive and able to re|late the cau&s;e of my terror. In the apart|ment adjoining the room where I &s;leep, the maid of the hou&s;e &s;leeps with two of the younger children, for they have a large fa|mily. About four o'clock this morning, I was awoke by a &s;en&s;e of &s;uffocation, and &s;tarting up, perceived my chamber to be full of &s;moak, I jumped out of bed and looking round to &s;ee that there was no appearance of fire in the room, ventured to open one of the windows a little way to di&s;per&s;e it. I then opened the door, which led to the chil|drens room, here the &s;moak was more thick, and I found the &s;mell of fire grow &s;tronger; but what were my &s;en&s;ations, on going into their apartment to &s;ee a ba&s;ket of cloaths which &s;tood on a chair by the bed&s;ide all on fire, and the curtains of the bed which were fortunately of woolen ju&s;t beginning to burn. I had not an in&s;tant for con&s;ideration, Provi|dence directed me; for I am con&s;cious that rea&s;on was for a few moments intirely &s;u&s;|pended, I ran back to my own bed; drag|ged of a blanket and immediately threw it over the burning ba&s;ket, at the &s;ame time
<PB N="78" REF="029439_0253_0FE114A6ACB16FD0">
pouring on it a large pan of water, which &s;tood in the room, and had been placed there for the purpo&s;e of wa&s;hing the chil|dren. I then awoke the &s;ervant, and took the dear little innocents out of the bed; they had been &s;o nearly &s;uffocated it was with difficulty I awoke them, and when brought into the air blood gu&s;hed from their no&s;es: when I had a little recovered them and laid them in my bed, I returned to the other chamber, &s;ent the maid down for more water, and having entirely extingui&s;hed every appearance of fire, began to have the u&s;e of reflection: my own almo&s;t miracu|lous e&s;cape from &s;o horrible a death, the &s;afety of the children, nay, the pre&s;ervation of the lives and property of the whole fami|ly, impre&s;&s;ed my mind with &s;uch awful gra|titude towards the Power, who had in &s;uch unexpected danger in&s;pired and directed me, that I threw my&s;elf on my knees and bur&s;t into tears of unfeigned thankfulne&s;s. Had I not di&s;covered it at the time I did, we mu&s;t all have inevitably peri&s;hed; for the re&s;t of the family lay in apartments built di&s;tinctly from this part of the hou&s;e: the apart|ments I occupied were over the &s;hop, and this room really belonged to me, but as I had no u&s;e for it I gave it up to the &s;ervant and children. The ma&s;ter, mi&s;tre&s;s, three more children and two apprentices, &s;lept on

the ground floor behind the &s;hop, &s;o that the whole front of the hou&s;e might have been in flames, before they would have di&s;|covered it. I a&s;ked the girl how &s;he ima|gined the accident had happened; &s;he &s;aid &s;he often was obliged to &s;it up very late for her ma&s;ter, that &s;he had been up that night, till near two o'clock, and being obliged to work very hard in the day time, &s;he was very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">leepy and weary; that &s;he imagines &s;he mu&s;t have left the candle burning on the floor, and that it had caught &s;ome of the linen that hung from the ba&s;ket. You may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e I was not inclined to go to bed again, I therefore dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, and waited the ri&s;ing of the family. When I heard Mrs. Newtram up, I took the two young children in my hand and went down. "You are up early, Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid &s;he, "I hope the children have not been making a noi&s;e to di&s;turb you." "I was up much earlier than you can imagine," I re|plied, "but believe me the&s;e little dears have been very quiet and good, but I was &s;adly alarmed this morning at four o'clock."</P>
<P>"Alarmed, my dear ma'am, at what?" "At an accident which had like to prove fatal to us all." "Good God!" &s;aid &s;he, "what can have been the matter?" "Come, come, my good Mrs. Newtram," &s;aid I, &s;eeing her turn pale, "there is no occa&s;ion for terror

now, the danger is pa&s;t, you &s;ee your chil|dren are &s;afe, but we have been all on fire up &s;tairs to night." "Merciful heaven!" &s;aid &s;he, "that carele&s;s Betty." "Do not blame the girl Mrs. Newtram, fatigued as &s;he is in the day time, &s;he cannot be &s;uppo&s;|ed capable of &s;itting up till two or three o'clock in the morning, e&s;pecially when we recollect &s;he in general ri&s;es at &s;ix, to per|form her daily avocations; and I will ju&s;t beg leave to mention that it is my earne&s;t wi&s;h &s;he may be forgiven: &s;he has &s;uffered enough already from her fright, do not, therefore, reproach her, and I will be an|&s;werable &s;uch an accident never happens again in any place where &s;he is." I then took Mrs. Newtram up &s;tairs, and &s;hewed her the things that had been on fire. When &s;he &s;aw the imminent danger to which her children had been expo&s;ed, &s;he caught them in her arms and with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of maternal affection, ble&s;t heaven for their pre&s;ervation. "Oh! Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid &s;he, "how can we ever be grateful enough for your quick recollection in &s;uch an alarm|ing &s;ituation; we are bound to con&s;ider you as our guardian angel."</P>
<P>I &s;topped the good woman in the mid&s;t of her acknowledgments, to renew my entre|ties for Betty's pardon, and that &s;he might
<PB N="81" REF="029439_0256_0FE114B4210ED078">
be continued in her place. "I can deny you nothing," &s;aid &s;he; "but I am afraid Mr. Newtram will be inveterate again&s;t her." "That will be cruel indeed," &s;aid I, "for he was him&s;elf undoubtedly the prior cau&s;e of the accident, by keeping &s;uch very late hours." She then went down &s;tairs, and I went to breakfa&s;t; which before I had half fini&s;hed was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Newtram. He repeated every acknow|ledgment before made by his wife, &s;ealed Betty's pardon, and declared he wi&s;hed for nothing more, than for &s;ome opportunity to convince me of his gratitude, and that he would almo&s;t lay down his life to &s;erve me. Thus you &s;ee, my dear Celia, this accident will in the end terminate for my good, as it &s;eems to have &s;ecured the af|fection and friend&s;hip of tho&s;e, in who&s;e hou&s;e I re&s;ide; and in ca&s;e of future trouble I make no doubt, but I &s;hall find in the&s;e worthy people, a kindne&s;s nearly maternal. Farewell my friend; your's ever.</P>

<P>MR. BELGER has frequently private concerts at his hou&s;e. I always am one of the party. Sometimes I perform on the piano forte; &s;ometimes &s;ing, and al|ways meet with &s;uch applau&s;e, as almo&s;t makes me vain; indeed the prai&s;es of Mr. Belger only, are &s;ufficient for that pur|po&s;e. He is the only man I could ever think perfectly agreeable, &s;ince the conduct of Rainsforth gave me &s;o very de&s;picable an opinion of the whole &s;ex. But of one thing I am convinced; it is dangerous to enter into arguments with per&s;ons who have an improper opinion of religious mat|ters. I have had frequent conver&s;ations with Mr. Belger on this topic, and in&s;tead of being able to convince him of his errors. (You will tremble whem I tell you) I have only imbibed his principles, and find doubt ari&s;ing in my mind concerning the mo&s;t &s;a|cred

parts of the holy writings. Oh! my dear Celia, pray for your weak friend, that &s;he may not be lo&s;t by li&s;tening to this in|&s;inuating man. I have indeed made fre|quent re&s;olutions to avoid his company, and as frequently broke them. I take my heart &s;everely to ta&s;k. Surely Celia, after it has &s;uffered &s;o much from the perfidy of the &s;ex, it cannot be &s;o weak, nay &s;o wicked, as to feel an attachment for a man who is ano|ther's right. Do not fear for me, my belov|ed friend; if I cannot command my feelings I can my actions. Should I at &s;ome future period di&s;cover that Rainsforth is not the capricious character, he at pre&s;ent appears, I will never have the mortification to re|flect, I have rendered my&s;elf unworthy of his e&s;teem: if otherwi&s;e, it &s;hall never be in the power of any man to boa&s;t, that he has triumphed over the virtue of Meriel Howard. No Celia, I may be unfortunate, but I never will be guilty.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s does not an&s;wer &s;o well as I ex|pected. Many, I believe, employed me at fir&s;t from motives of curio&s;ity, and that being gratified, they return to tho&s;e they formerly dealt with; and I have now &s;carce|ly enough to employ my&s;elf, and one young woman, whom Mrs. Moreton has recom|mended to me. However, I keep up my

<P>WHAT a world this is, my friend, and of what a medly of &s;trange in|con&s;i&s;tent characters is it compo&s;ed. Were it not impious, I could wi&s;h I had never en|tered it. Some few years &s;ince, I believed every heart glowed with humanity, friend&s;hip and &s;incerity toward each other. Yes, Ce|lia, at the time I left the convent the&s;e were
<PB N="85" REF="029439_0260_0FE114C63AA45C10">
my ideas of the world. Nay it is but very lately I began to perceive how erroneous my opinion was; but believe me, the more we know of mankind the le&s;s we find to admire or e&s;teem. The heart grows hardened by repeated di&s;appointments, and from having an unbounded confidence in our fellow-crea|tures, we begin to &s;u&s;pect every one of hy|pocri&s;y.</P>
<P>My dear friend, I am &s;till the &s;port of ca|pricious fortune. Deceived, betrayed by tho&s;e I mo&s;t loved and tru&s;ted, I have no comfort left but my dependance on heaven, (which thank God, I have regained) and the con&s;cious integrity of my own heart.</P>
<P>Some little time after my la&s;t letter, Mrs. Moreton called on me one morning, in her way to town, and a&s;ked if I would take a ride with her. She was in Mr. Belger's carriage. I had nothing to prevent me and immedi|ately complied. We proceeded to town, and &s;topped at a &s;ilk mercer's. Mrs. More|ton ordered &s;ome &s;ilks to be put up, but when &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame to pay for them, di&s;covered &s;he had left her pur&s;e behind her. I had money &s;uf|ficient about me, and therefore offered to pay the amount of the bill. "Do &s;o, my dear," &s;aid &s;he, "it will be all the &s;ame. I can pay you again when we get home." It came to
<PB N="86" REF="029439_0261_0FE114CB732FAEF8">
upwards of ten pounds, as &s;he purcha&s;ed a piece of &s;ilk for a lady whom &s;he expected out of the country. When we returned the ex|pected lady was arrived. She approved the &s;ilk, and after dinner took a walk to my apart|ments, where &s;he ordered &s;ome very elegant linen to be made: the lace &s;he cho&s;e it to be trimed with, was two guineas per yard. You can get this done by Saturday afternoon, &s;aid Mrs. Moreton, for we are obliged to pay a vi&s;it to very particular people, and this lady would wi&s;h to have it to wear. As &s;oon as they were gone, I wrote to a laceman in town, to &s;end me more of the lace; for the handker|chief, apron, and ruffles were all to be full trimed. As I had dealt with him before, he did not he&s;itate. The mu&s;lin I had by me; and on Saturday afternoon, according to their de&s;ire, I took the whole &s;uit home, which, when fini&s;hed, came to near fifty pounds. They were much plea&s;ed with it, and de&s;ired I would bring my bill on Monday morning, about twelve o'clock. I had a &s;mall gold watch by my &s;ide, which was given me by Mr. Welldon. It was of no great value, but for the &s;ake of the doner, it was highly prized by me. "Meriel, my love," &s;aid Mrs. Moreton, "I have &s;ent my watch to be cleaned; I &s;hall be at a lo&s;s to know how time goes: do lend me your's for this even|ing."</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="029439_0262_0FE114CFB7522F88">
"I &s;et great &s;tore by it, madam," &s;aid I, "it was the gift of a decea&s;ed friend; but I think you will be careful of it." "As I would of my own," &s;he replied, as &s;he took it. "Stay, madam," &s;aid I, "there is a little trinket to it which I have vowed never to part with." (It was a &s;mall locket which con|tained a lock of my dear mother's hair). She &s;uffered me to take it off, and Mr. Bel|ger's coach coming to the door to attend the ladies, they &s;et me down at my own lodging, and proceeded to town.</P>
<P>The next day, being Sunday, I dined at Mr. Belger's, where I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that the ladies had &s;ent home the carriage, without returning them&s;elves, and that Mrs. Moreton's children were in town with her. However I felt no unea&s;ine&s;s or &s;u&s;picion, and on Monday morning repaired to Mrs. Moreton's with my bill: but to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment found the hou&s;e entirely &s;hut up, and was informed by a neighbour, that it was a ready furni&s;hed hou&s;e, which &s;he had occupied near a twelve-month, and that &s;he had di&s;charged her &s;ervant on Saturday morning; that they had every rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e &s;he did not intend to come back again, for &s;he had not paid the hou&s;e rent, and was be&s;ides in debt to every body in the neigh|bourhood, who would tru&s;t her; and that
<PB N="88" REF="029439_0263_0FE114D4DA8A72E8">
on going into the hou&s;e, which the landlord had done early this morning, they found nothing in it that had ever belonged to her; but mi&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable quantity of linen, which had been lent her when &s;he took the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was now fatally convinced that my con|fidence in Mrs. Moreton had been ill pla|ced; the linen I had made, the money I had lent, had, altogether, greatly contributed to reduce my finances, and I began to &s;ee the difficulties, in which this ungenerous con|duct would involve me. At fir&s;t, it &s;truck me, that Mr. Belger had been acce&s;&s;ary to her departure; but in this I was deceived, for on calling there, I found they were as greatly &s;urprized as I had been, and that her &s;pecious appearance had &s;o far impo&s;ed on him, that he had lent her twenty guineas only a few days before. Overwhelm'd with this new affliction, I returned to my lodg|ing; but judge if you po&s;&s;ibly can, of my increa&s;ed angui&s;h, when, on entering my bed-chamber, I &s;aw my bureau had been forced open, all my ca&s;h gone, and with it a quantity of edging to a large amount. Almo&s;t ready to &s;ink with the terror that &s;eized my mind, I rang the bell violently, and nobody immediately an&s;wering, I ran down to Mrs. Newtram's apartments and
<PB N="89" REF="029439_0264_0FE114D92E662898">
enquired after Kitty. "Ble&s;s me, Mi&s;s How|ard," &s;aid Mrs. Newtram, "did you not di&s;charge her before you went out this morning." "No, indeed I had not the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of &s;uch a thing."</P>
<P>"Well, that's &s;trange now; for you had not been out above five minutes, before &s;he came down crying, and begged one of the apprentices to go for a coach, &s;aid you had di&s;charged her at a moment's warning, but &s;he would go directly home to her mother. When the coach came, we helped her in with her boxes, and &s;he drove away, order|ing the man to &s;top at the White Hor&s;e Cellar, Piccadilly."</P>
<P>"I'm undone," &s;aid I, "what will be|come of me;" and &s;unk almo&s;t fainting, into a chair. Mrs. Newtram got me &s;ome hart&s;horn and water, after which I began to &s;hed tears, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure reliev|ed me. "Dear Mi&s;s," cried Mrs. New|tram, "what can have happened: have you lo&s;t any of your friends?" "Oh!" &s;aid I, "I have no friends; I am the mo&s;t unfortunate creature breathing, nor do I know how to extricate my&s;elf from the difficulties that &s;urround me."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="029439_0265_0FE114DE68D02A78">
I then gave her an account of Mrs. More|ton's departure, of the money, &amp;c. I had tru&s;ted her with, and concluded with the di&s;covery I had ju&s;t made of Kitty's di&s;|hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>"Why to be &s;ure Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid &s;he, "it is a &s;ad lo&s;s; but you &s;hould have been upon your guard again&s;t Mrs. More|ton; you certainly knew &s;he was a woman of dubious character; and to tell you the truth, Mr. Newtram and I have often &s;aid it was a great pity, &s;o &s;weet a young lady &s;hould be &s;o intimate, with a woman of that kind: then there is Mrs. Belger, why all the world knows &s;he is no better than &s;he &s;hould be; and you can't think what ill natured things have been &s;aid in the neigh|bourhood, about your being &s;o much with them."</P>
<P>"As to Mrs. Moreton," &s;aid I, "be|lieve me, I had not the lea&s;t idea, but that &s;he was a woman of re&s;pectable character; and tho' I have heard &s;ome things, not quite &s;o much to Mrs. Belger's advantage, I never &s;aw a woman in my life who&s;e whole con|duct demanded more re&s;pect and e&s;teem." "Upon my word Mi&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, "I am &s;urprized to hear you talk &s;o, when you know (drawing up her head) Mr. Belger
<PB N="91" REF="029439_0266_0FE114E12CD65138">
is not her hu&s;band; but that I have a very good opinion of you, I &s;hould think you was as bad as &s;he."</P>
<P>"I think, Mrs. Newtram," &s;aid I, "as you &s;eem to know Mrs. Moreton's character &s;o well it would have been but friendly to have given me a little warning."</P>
<P>"Why, la! Mi&s;s, you know it was no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine, and you told me your&s;elf you knew her before you came to &s;ettle here: but, how do you mean to do? I &s;up|po&s;e you have &s;ome friends to whom you can apply; if you have any letter, or any thing to &s;end to town one of our young men &s;hall take it."</P>
<P>"I tell you again Mrs. Newtram, I have not a friend in the world; I am a poor &s;oli|tary being, unconnected with the world, or any one in it; and were I this moment to leave it, not one tear of affection or regret would be &s;hed upon my grave."</P>
<P>"Dear now that's very odd, mo&s;t peo|ple have &s;ome friend or other, but I &s;uppo&s;e you have offended all your's." "They are dead," &s;aid I, "and unle&s;s you favour me with your advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I know not to whom el&s;e to apply." "To be &s;ure, I'll
<PB N="92" REF="029439_0267_0FE114E6B6C22C58">
give you the be&s;t advice in my power, but had you not better apply to Mr. Belger?"</P>
<P>"Oh no, I would wi&s;h to hide my di&s;|tre&s;s from him in particular." "You are in debt? I &s;uppo&s;e," a&s;ked Mrs. Newtram, in a quick accent.</P>
<P>"Yes, I owe above forty guineas." "Well, and there is a quarter's rent of the lodging due, that's eight more, then there's the laundre&s;s and the baker." "True," &s;aid I, in an humble tone, "but I &s;uppo&s;e my furniture will &s;ell for as much as will pay them." "And is that all your depen|dance? then I &s;hall take care that we loo&s;e nothing: here, Newtram," continued &s;he, opening a door that looked into the &s;hop, "here, &s;tep here:" when he came in, &s;he told him my &s;ituation and concluded, "then you know, as that is the ca&s;e, we had better take care of our&s;elves, and be the fir&s;t to take the furniture."</P>
<P>"That's true dame," &s;aid he, "&s;o d'ye &s;ee, Mi&s;s, we'll &s;end for a man to 'prai&s;e the goods to-morrow."</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hment almo&s;t &s;u&s;pended my facul|ties: "ju&s;t heaven!" &s;aid I, "is this friend&s;hip?"</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="029439_0268_0FE114E9AABB06A0">
"Friend&s;hip," &s;aid &s;he, tartly, "I have a large family Mi&s;s, and all my friend&s;hip mu&s;t be exerted for my children: if I was inclined to give you the eight guineas you owe me I cannot do it in ju&s;tice to the&s;e little innocents."</P>
<P>Celia, &s;he pointed to the two children I had &s;aved from the fire: I fixed my eyes on the unoffending infants, a fre&s;h flood of tears bur&s;t from them, I folded my hands upon my bo&s;om and remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>It was now one o'clock and the &s;ervant brought in their dinner; they &s;at down to table, but did not a&s;k me to partake, I &s;hould not have noticed the impropriety of my re|maining in their apartment, had I not been rou&s;ed from my &s;tupefaction by the young|e&s;t girl, who getting from her &s;eat brought her plate of victuals and laid it in my lap, and taking up a bit put it towards my mouth crying, "there Mi&s;&s;y eat &s;ome dinnee." I ki&s;&s;ed the dear child, and apologizing for my intru&s;ion went up to my apartment; where I vented my full heart, in an unre|&s;trained flood of tears.</P>
<P>Toward evening Betty came into my room; &s;he &s;aid her mi&s;tre&s;s was gone out, and &s;he had &s;tolen up unknown to her ma&s;ter
<PB N="94" REF="029439_0269_0FE1157066D8D6E8">
to &s;ee if &s;he could do any thing for me. "You have had no dinner," &s;aid the kind girl, "pray let me get you &s;ome tea." She then made up the &s;ire, and pre&s;ently provided this repa&s;t, which however di&s;|inclined, I forced my&s;elf to take, to ea&s;e poor Betty's anxiety. When &s;he had re|moved the tea things and lighted a candle, &s;he went down &s;tairs again, and I &s;at pen&s;ive and &s;olitary, retracing the pa&s;t events of my life. Alas! &s;aid I, how very hard is my fate. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as I am of a heart moulded to com|pa&s;&s;ion, glowing with univer&s;al affection to|wards my fellow creatures, I am con&s;tantly thrown among people, who&s;e every feel|ing is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">bed in &s;elf. Yet &s;ure huma|nity is the child of nature; it is a heavenly &s;park of intellectual fire, implanted in our &s;ouls by the hand divine. Every heart is endowed with it more or le&s;s; but an inter|cour&s;e with the world contributes to blunt tho&s;e keen &s;en&s;ations, till by degrees they are entirely deadened, and we can look on a &s;cene of mi&s;ery without the lea&s;t emotion, if it interferes not with our own intere&s;t or hap|pine&s;s. Yet I cannot think that I &s;hall ever arrive at that happy &s;tate of torpidity, for &s;ure, while I can feel my own &s;orrows, I &s;hall never be in&s;en&s;ible to the woes of others; for never yet did I &s;ee a per&s;on in affliction, but I made their ca&s;e my own, and my heart would in|&s;tantly
<PB N="95" REF="029439_0270_0FE114EF52A57BB8">
overflow with pity. But alas! no heart melts with pity for me. Even Mrs. Newtram &s;eems to have forgot that &s;he has daughters, or &s;he would &s;urely compa&s;&s;ionate my &s;ufferings, by reflecting that tho&s;e darl|ings of her heart may perhaps one day be in the &s;ame &s;ituation. I was &s;till pur&s;uing this melancholy train of thought, when I was &s;tartled by a gentle tap at the door. I aro&s;e and opened it, but was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee Mr. Bel|ger enter the room. "Dear Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid he, "forgive this liberty. I have been informed of your di&s;tre&s;s by your officious landlady, whom I have left chattering to to Mrs. Belger, while I &s;lipped away to offer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ny a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power to my charming little friend." I bowed my head, but could not an&s;wer. I motioned towards a chair. He &s;eated him&s;elf and continued: "My dear Meriel, I have long feared what is now re|alized; I knew from the fir&s;t moment I &s;aw you, that you were never de&s;igned for the &s;tation, in which you have lately moved. The elegance of your manner, the delicacy of your &s;entiments convince me you are far &s;u|perior to tho&s;e women with whom it has been your misfortune to be obliged to a&s;&s;ociate." "Indeed, Mr. Belger," &s;aid I, "I am con|&s;cious of that &s;uperioty in nothing but mi&s;e|ry. I look round me with a de&s;ponding eye,
<PB N="96" REF="029439_0271_0FE114F3FA16A6B8">
and think the world does not contain &s;o friendle&s;s, &s;o wretched a creature as my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"From my &s;oul do I pity you," &s;aid he, taking my hand, "and wi&s;h it was in my power effectually to &s;erve you without offer|ing any thing that might alarm your &s;en&s;ibi|lity; but that is impo&s;&s;ible. I know of but one method, by which you can be extricated from your pre&s;ent difficulties." "Alas, &s;ir," I replied, "I have not the lea&s;t hope of be|ing extricated. All my furniture will be &s;eized to-morrow, and I &s;hall be turned from this habitation without knowing how to pro|vide another."</P>

You mu&s;t have &s;een my ardent affection, which has &s;o often bur&s;t thro' the thin veil, prudence obliged me to throw over it; and if vanity has not mi&s;led me, I flatter my&s;elf I am not altogether indifferent to you; if &s;o, my dear creature, what remains, but that we this night bid adieu to all the&s;e vexations?

<P>Amazement had taken entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me during this &s;peech; I was almo&s;t de|deprived of the power of utterance. At length I exclaimed "good God! how have I de&s;erved this in&s;ult? Ungenerous man, have you forgot Mrs. Belger."</P>
<P>"Dear Meriel," &s;aid he, "do not rai&s;e imaginary ob&s;tacles. You as well as all the re&s;t of the world know I am not married to that woman."</P>
<P>"But you are bound to her, &s;ir, by every tie of honour and gratitude."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid he, gravely, "can you lay your hand upon your heart, and &s;ay you do not regard me with a &s;entiment more lively than friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>"If I know that heart, Mr. Belger, it will never love whom it cannot e&s;teem. And whatever may be its feeling I have learnt to conquer." I could not fini&s;h what I intended to &s;ay, my tears flowed &s;o fa&s;t they almo&s;t choaked me.</P>

<P>"What will become of your Emma," &s;aid I, "Can you re&s;olve to for&s;ake your child?"</P>
<P>"Thank you, my &s;weet girl, for the re|membrance, &s;he &s;hall be the companion of our flight."</P>
<P>"And &s;o drive her poor mother to di&s;|traction. No, Mr. Belger, never &s;hall it be &s;aid of Meriel Howard, that &s;he had by her perfidy placed a dagger in the heart of an innocent woman; nor &s;hall you forget this confiding, affectionate woman. Has &s;he not &s;acrificed every con&s;ideration to you, friends, reputation, all that can render life de&s;irea|ble. If &s;he is not your wife, &s;he ought to have been &s;o long &s;ince.

<P>"By heavens! Mi&s;s Howard I will marry you." "No, Mr. Belger, that would be only u&s;ing the &s;acred ceremony as a cloak to perfidy and deceit.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 2<HI>d,</HI> 1781.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I JUDGE of my dear Celia's impatience, by what I &s;hould feel where &s;he in the &s;i|tuation in which I was, when I concluded my la&s;t: I will not trifle with you, but pro|ceed in my narrative. The next morning I aro&s;e and went down &s;tairs to Mr. Newtram, told him I was ready to admit the per&s;ons he had mentioned into the apartment to va|lue the furniture, and hoped there would be more than &s;ufficient to pay all I owed: I was continuing to &s;peak to him, when turn|ing my head I &s;aw the laceman enter the &s;hop. He pretended not to know my &s;itua|tion, tho' I am certain he had been &s;ent for by Newtram, and told me a long &s;tory, to which I paid but little attention, about hav|ing a large &s;um to make up, &amp;c. I de&s;ired him to wait a little while, and I made no
<PB N="102" REF="029439_0277_0FE11510D6599E60">
doubt but I &s;hould have &s;ufficient to di&s;charge his bill. Alas! my Celia, I did not at that time think of the va&s;t difference between &s;ell|ing and buying. I knew the little furniture I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, together with what Mr. Welldon had given me, had co&s;t more than &s;ixty pounds and were at pre&s;ent nearly as good as new. But when the man had looked them over, and taken an inventory, he offered me only thirty five guineas for the whole, in which was included my piano forte. I urged how much more they had co&s;t me, and how little they had been u&s;ed. He an&s;wered that was nothing to him; he could afford to give no more; there were &s;ome things would be of no u&s;e to him; they would lay a dead &s;tock upon his hands, and if I did not choo&s;e to take that, it was all very well, he had rather leave them than have them.</P>
<P>What could I do? I found I mu&s;t either &s;ell them or go to pri&s;on, and tho' I knew not by what means to &s;upport life, liberty had &s;till &s;ome charms for me. I took the money, and turning toward my creditors, for by this time they were all a&s;&s;embled, laid the money on the table, and de&s;ired Mr. Newtram to pay them all as far as it would go; but they were not to be &s;atisfied with this. "You have good cloaths, Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid New|tram, "you cannot expect poor people will
<PB N="103" REF="029439_0278_0FE1151650089D40">
&s;et down quietly with their lo&s;s, and &s;uffer you to go off with a trunk full of finery." "Alas! &s;ir," &s;aid I, "the cloaths you men|tion are &s;o few and compo&s;ed of &s;uch indif|ferent materials, I did not think they would be of any value but to the owner. There are &s;ome few pices of edging, &s;ir," continued I, turning to the laceman, "which I mu&s;t beg of you to take again." My trunks were now brought down &s;tairs. Mrs. Newtram cho&s;e out the be&s;t of my gowns, linen, &amp;c. which were &s;et down at le&s;s than half their value: the edgings were produced, when to my ut|ter a&s;toni&s;hment, the laceman declared he would not take them without an allowance of one third of what I had paid him for them only a few months before.</P>
<P>At length all demands were di&s;charged, my furniture taken away, and my&s;elf left &s;o|litary in the empty rooms: I went down &s;tairs and delivered up the keys. I had done no|thing but weep all day, and had taken no kind of nouri&s;hment &s;ince my breakfa&s;t, and it was now four o'clock in the afternoon. Mrs. Newtram did not a&s;k me to &s;it down; but when I left the parlour I felt my&s;elf &s;o &s;ick and faint that I was obliged to &s;it down on the foot of the &s;tairs, where my feelings became &s;o poignant that I thought I &s;hould have been &s;uffocated. Poor Betty came to
<PB N="104" REF="029439_0279_0FE1151A9E3D1AA8">
me, and endeavoured to comfort me, but her own &s;obs were &s;o audible as to prevent my under&s;tanding what &s;he &s;aid: In a few moments Mrs. Newtram came out of the parlour. "Dear me, Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid &s;he, "you will make your&s;elf quite ill with fretting, and then, what is to become of you; come, come, cheer up, all will be well again, by and by; one of our young men will call you a coach, you don't con&s;ider how &s;oon it is dark this time of the year." "I don't want a coach," &s;aid I, "there is nothing very heavy to carry; I will tye up a few things in a handkerchief and leave the re&s;t till I have &s;ome &s;ettled place of abode, when I will &s;end for them." "But it's a wet evening, child," &s;aid &s;he, "and a long walk to town." "No matter, I will not have a coach." "Perhaps, Mi&s;s Howard, you will be affronted, but if you cannot pay for one, accept the&s;e five &s;hillings."</P>
<P>Celia, this vile o&s;tentation, this &s;hew of genero&s;ity, after &s;he had &s;tripped me of al|mo&s;t every thing, awakened my re&s;entment. "No, Mrs. Newtram," &s;aid I, "if I am obliged to borrow money, I have a few more cloaths left, on which I imagine I can rai&s;e it; but at pre&s;ent I have a few &s;hillings, which is &s;ufficient for this evening, to-mor|row I will &s;end for my cloaths." She flung
<PB N="105" REF="029439_0280_0FE1151FB43E3CB0">
into the parlour, muttering &s;omething about ingratitude, pride and poverty. It was a cold rainy evening, the latter end of October, when with a &s;mall bundle in my hand, and a load of grief at my heart, I &s;et forward on foot from Ken&s;ington; I had not proceeded far before I heard a quick &s;tep behind me, and pre&s;ently was acco&s;ted by Mr. Belger.</P>
<P>"Where are you going my dear crea|ture, this cold, wet night?" "I am going to town, &s;ir, and am in ha&s;te." "Where &s;hall you lodge in town?" "Indeed, I do not know." "My dear Mi&s;s Howard, you are I fear more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed than you are will|ing to confe&s;s, believe me I am your friend, confide in me, I will not &s;uffer you to want any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power to give; but we cannot conveniently con&s;ult what is be&s;t to be done, thus in the open &s;treet; &s;tep into this hou&s;e, (we were ju&s;t oppo&s;ite an hou&s;e of entertainment,) I have ordered my car|riage here to take me up, and when we have had a cup of tea we will proceed to town together."</P>
<P>"No, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "it is to no purpo&s;e to &s;olicit me, I am determined to go on to town immediately." "Than let me call a coach, my dear girl, you mu&s;t not be thus expo&s;ed to the inclemency of the weather."</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="029439_0281_0FE1152284ECA2A8">
"Mr. Belger, if you wi&s;h me to believe you my friend, leave me, nor thus increa&s;e my almo&s;t in&s;upportable load of angui&s;h, by making offers which I neither can nor will accept." "Then let me have the plea&s;ure of &s;upplying you with ca&s;h till it is in your power to repay me." This too I ob&s;tinate|ly refu&s;ed, and the rain ju&s;t then increa&s;ing, he cea&s;ed his &s;olicitations after &s;aying I &s;hould always find a friend in him, he left me to pur&s;ue my uncomfortable walk. It was near &s;even o'clock, when I arrived in town, with only a few &s;hillings in my pocket no friend to apply to and entirely at a lo&s;s how to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf that night, as the people in London are fearful of taking &s;tran|gers into their hou&s;es, without a proper re|commendation; not having &s;ufficient re&s;o|lution to apply to any hou&s;e for a lodging I kept walking on till I came to the &s;trand, where, ju&s;t as I was pa&s;&s;ing a large haberda&s;h|er's &s;hop, a carriage overturned, the hor&s;es took fright, and I ran with many others into the &s;hop, for &s;afety; I had not been there above five minutes, before I heard a female voice exclaim, good God! can it be? yes, I am certain it is Mi&s;s Howard; the lady had now come clo&s;e up to me, and on rai&s;ing my eyes, I beheld Amelia Sidney a young lady whom I had once or twice &s;een at my aunts.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="029439_0282_0FE11528070C4E58">
Shall I confe&s;s, that &s;hame at being &s;een in &s;o draggled a condition was the fir&s;t &s;en|&s;ation I felt, however, Amelia &s;oon made me forget that, when kindly taking my hand in the &s;oft voice of affection, &s;he &s;aid, "my dear Mi&s;s Howard, where have you hid your&s;elf all this time;" then ob&s;erving my wet cloak and bonnet, &s;he continued: "You have been walking in the rain my love, I have a coach waiting, give me leave to &s;et you down wherever you wi&s;h to go." The &s;oothing voice of tenderne&s;s as &s;oon wrings tears from the afflicted heart, as does the churli&s;h voice of chiding, but then the one drops gently, while the &s;ofte&s;t &s;en|&s;ations pervade the &s;oul, the other is the &s;ource of &s;uch real angui&s;h, that memory will retain the pain they occa&s;ion for years afterwards.</P>
<P>I could not an&s;wer the kind mi&s;s Sidney, but followed her in &s;ilence to the coach, when we were &s;eated &s;he again renewed her que&s;tion, "where will you be &s;et down?" The angui&s;h of my heart now bur&s;t out, and I cried, I have no home: all places are alike to me, "then you &s;hall go home with me," &s;aid Amelia. "Oh Mi&s;s Sid|ney," &s;aid I, "do not think by thus accpt|ing your kind offer of &s;tepping into the coach I mean to throw my&s;elf on your be|nevolence,
<PB N="108" REF="029439_0283_0FE1152C85423100">
my only motive was to have an opportunity of enquiring whether you could recommend me to any place, where I might lodge for a little time, till I could con&s;ider how to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf in future. Favour me with your advice, dear lady, for indeed I have no friends in the world, who intere&s;ts them&s;elves the lea&s;t in my welfare." She pre&s;&s;ed my hand and after &s;oftly &s;aying, "be comfored, my dear," remained &s;ilent, till the coach &s;topped, &s;he then a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to alight, and leading me up &s;tairs left me a few moments in the drawing room; but &s;oon returned with her mother. Mrs. Sidney received me with the chearful &s;mile of an old friend, and Amelia brought a change of cloaths which &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my putting on. Supper &s;oon came in. The manner which Mrs. Sidney and her daughter ob&s;erved towards me, was delicate and attentive in the extreme. Not a word &s;caped them that had the lea&s;t appearance of curio&s;ity; they &s;eemed to treat me as tho' I had been paying an expected vi&s;it, and to con&s;ider my com|pany as an obligation; when the cloath was removed, I told my amiable ho&s;te&s;s, I thought it but right &s;he &s;hould know by what means I became reduced to &s;o di&s;tre&s;t a condi|tion, but Amelia &s;topped me. "Dear Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid &s;he, "if it is in our power to &s;erve you, do not he&s;itate to point out
<PB N="109" REF="029439_0284_0FE11531E8CFAD78">
the way, and you will not find us backward in performing it; but I in&s;i&s;t that you do not enter into explanations which may be painful to you. You have no doubt been unfortunate, as &s;uch and knowing the ex|cellence of your heart, you have a claim upon my friend&s;hip, I am ready to prove my&s;elf your &s;incere well wi&s;her, but I have no right to enter into a minute inve&s;tigation of your pa&s;t conduct." "But, my dear lady," &s;aid I, "it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, you &s;hould be acquainted with many pa&s;t in|cidents of my life, that you may better con|cieve my pre&s;ent &s;ituation and be enabled to favour me with your advice, for my future conduct. "Well, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Sid|ney, "whatever you think proper," "I thank heaven madam," &s;aid I, "tho' I &s;hall &s;hall acquaint you with many errors, &s;ome of which I tremble but to think on, (for at that moment, Celia, I remembered my impious de&s;pondency, and the divine interpo&s;ition of providence which delivered me at the very moment, when to avoid temporal mi&s;ery I was ru&s;hing into guilt.) Yet I have done nothing to make me a&s;hamed, and tho' my reputation has been &s;ullied. "We have all our errors, Mi&s;s Howard," &s;aid Amelia, "and we all hope to have tho&s;e errors forgiven, then &s;hould we not be always rea|dy to forgive the errors of our fellow crea|tures.
<PB N="110" REF="029439_0285_0FE1153658128190">
Come my dear girl let me per&s;uade you to drop the &s;ubject, whatever have been your errors I am &s;ure you now renounce them, and whatever are your misfortunes we will &s;trive to aleviate, if we cannot entirely remove them." "You are very good, Mi&s;s Sidney, but give me leave to proceed, I will not detain you long." I then in as few words as po&s;&s;ible compri&s;ed the whole of my &s;ufferings, not even endeavouring to veil my errors, from the time of my father's im|pri&s;onment, till the pre&s;ent day; &s;he li&s;tened with attention, and taking my hand &s;aid, "Conviction &s;its on your countenance, I will not doubt your relation, my dear Meriel, becau&s;e it has been delivered with &s;uch in|genious frankne&s;s that to hear is to believe; but you have been &s;trangely mi&s;repre&s;ented, by tho&s;e who&s;e duty it was to defend rather than a&s;per&s;e your character." She then in|formed me that the Mo&s;&s;ops had propogated the mo&s;t malignant cen&s;ures again&s;t me, and from at fir&s;t pointing me out as an ob|ject of ridicule to entertain their friends, at length repre&s;ented me as fit only for their contempt. In &s;hort, folly, ignorance, hypo|cri&s;y, and profligacy, had been &s;et forward, as the mo&s;t &s;triking traits in my character, and at the very moment when Amelia met me, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed me &s;unk into infamy and &s;hame. "But," &s;aid &s;he, "I &s;aw you was
<PB N="111" REF="029439_0286_0FE1153B6D5BD8D0">
unhappy, and I know it is our duty not to remember the faults, when an opportunity offers, wherein we may be of &s;ervice to a per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, I am now more than ever convinced of the propriety of &s;uch a mode of conduct, for had I not acted thus, I &s;hould never have known how much Mi&s;s Howard had been injured, and how little her unworthy friends de&s;erved &s;uch a rela|tive, but I beg," continued &s;he, "you will con&s;ider your&s;elf at home. Believe me, you are as welcome as a &s;i&s;ter, and whenever you hear of a &s;ituation which you think will &s;uit you, my mother and I will give you every nece&s;&s;ary recommendation, but do not be in a hurry to leave us, we &s;hall not &s;oon be tired of your company."</P>
<P>She then &s;hewed me to a neat bed-chamber adjoining her own, and wi&s;hing me a good nights repo&s;e, left me. And who is this bene|volent girl? methinks I hear you &s;ay. She is, my dear Celia, the daughter of a man, who by indu&s;try in a re&s;pectable line of bu&s;ine&s;s, brought up a numerous family in a reputable manner. He lived to &s;ee his &s;ons well &s;ettled in the world, and had &s;aved enough to leave at his death, Mrs. Sidney and this, his only daughter a comfortable independence. Ame|lia had a genteel, but yet u&s;eful education, &s;he was equally qualified to &s;hine in public or
<PB N="112" REF="029439_0287_0FE1154047F3DF98">
private life, &s;he preferred the latter. Her mother's happine&s;s con&s;tituted her own, &s;he read to her, worked with her, con&s;idered her peace as the main &s;pring for all her acti|ons, and loved her with a tender re&s;pect bordering on devotion. Yet with a plea&s;ing graceful per&s;on, a lively di&s;po&s;ition, and a large &s;hare of good &s;en&s;e, has this amiable girl reached her twety-fifth year, without one offer of marriage, &s;he has had many lovers, but &s;he declares they all de&s;erted their colours, when they under&s;tood, &s;he would have no fortune till the death of her mother. "So you &s;ee, my dear," &s;aid &s;he, one day &s;miling "I am de&s;tined to wear the willow as long as I live." More &s;hame for the male world if &s;he is, Celia, for I think I could venture to pronounce him a happy man, who &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to obtain &s;uch a wife.</P>
<P>I have been in this kind family, now near a month, but have not as yet heard of any thing, that I think will &s;uit, tho' I am deter|mined to take almo&s;t any &s;ituation rather than remain a burthen upon the benevolence of Amelia and her mother; who, tho' they have &s;ufficient for all the comforts and &s;ome of the elegancies of life, I am &s;ure, cannot afford to have me con&s;tantly with them. I &s;ent for the re&s;t of my cloaths the day after I left Ken&s;ington, but received no me&s;&s;age
<PB N="113" REF="029439_0288_0FE1154562F40B38">
from thence, nor have I heard a &s;yllable of Mr. Belger, I hope you will grant me the credit of not wi&s;hing it. I even gave the per|&s;on who went for my things a &s;trict charge, not to mention in what part of the town I re&s;ided.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>A lady called this evening at Mrs. Sid|ney's, who &s;aid &s;he had heard of a place which &s;he thought would &s;uit me: it is to be companion to an elderly lady in the country, to read to her, walk with her help entertain her company and attend a little to the do|me&s;tic concerns of the family. The &s;alary, I find, is but &s;mall, that &s;hall be no objection, I never was extravagant in dre&s;s, and I think I &s;hall hardly begin now. I am to go to-mor|row morning at ten o'clock to &s;peak to a lady, who is a di&s;tant relation of Mrs. Rook&s;|by, and who has been de&s;ired by her to look out for the kind of per&s;on &s;he wants. I wi&s;h I may be &s;o lucky as to &s;ucceed in this ap|plication, as I tru&s;t I could render my&s;elf agreeable to the old lady, and I would like|wi&s;e exert my&s;elf to be u&s;eful. The mail goes to-morrow, before I &s;hall have time to write again, but my Celia, may depend on my &s;eizing the fir&s;t opportunity, to let her know my &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>CELIA, my beloved Celia, when is my heart to be at re&s;t, when &s;hall I &s;ay, "peace dwells in my bo&s;om, its anxieties are hu&s;hed, doubt, fear, and incertitude, are no more." Alas! I fear Meriel will never feel that heavenly &s;atisfaction, 'till &s;huddering on the verge of eternity, &s;he &s;ixes her hope on things immortal, immutable and unchange|able. But forgive me my friend, when I took

up my pen, I meant not to complain, indeed I did not, I am fully &s;en&s;ible if my ble&s;&s;ings were mea&s;ured only according to my de|merits, I &s;hould be poor indeed, but our heavenly father, portions out our comforts according to the mea&s;ure of his love. Alas! if our de&s;erts were only con&s;idered, who would dare abide the deci&s;ion; friend&s;hip is his choice&s;t be&s;t gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and have I not found that pure and un-alloyed in the brea&s;ts of Celia and Amleia. As to love;
<Q><L>It is an empty &s;ound,</L>
<L>The haughty fair one's je&s;t</L>
<L>On earth un&s;een or only found</L>
<L>To warm the turtles ne&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>Oh yes there is love on earth; &s;incere, tender, affectionate, faithful, ardent hearts, but they were not formed for me, Celia; and I mu&s;t learn &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion without repining, you wonder what all this means, I cannot tell you ju&s;t now; when I am more compo&s;ed I will re&s;ume my pen. How &s;trange does it appear that I &s;hould be an object of malice or envy to others, who never harboured a wi&s;h to the prejudice, or envied the good fortune of any one.</P>
<P>The morning after I &s;ent off my la&s;t, my dear Celia, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf neat but very
<PB N="116" REF="029439_0291_0FE115547219C670">
plain, and at ten o'clock found my&s;elf at the door of Mr. Kingly, in Golden &s;quare, the &s;ervant, who opened it, told me his lady was not come down: he begged I would wait in a parlour, where there was a fire, and brought me a new&s;paper to amu&s;e me. In about twenty minutes, he returned and de|&s;ired me to walk up &s;tairs. I followed him into a back drawing room, where an elegant woman &s;at preparing to make tea, and a nur&s;e was in the room with a very young child. The lady aro&s;e and received me with every mark of politene&s;s; but I was &s;carcely &s;eated before a voice &s;truck my ears, which vibrated to my throbbing heart, I felt my face glow, but had not a moment for thought, before the door opened, and Rainsforth en|tered the room holding a boy about twelve months old in his arms. Surpri&s;e threw me entirely off my guard, I gave a &s;udden &s;hriek and fainted.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed during my indi&s;po&s;ition I cannot tell, but when I recovered, I found the lady &s;itting be&s;ide me on the &s;opha, applying volatiles to my no&s;e and temples, while a maid &s;ervant &s;tood by with water, but neither Rainsforth or the children were in the room. "Are you &s;ubject to the&s;e ill turns, my dear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">?" &s;aid the lady. "No madam," &s;aid I, "but &s;udden &s;urpri&s;e will
<PB N="117" REF="029439_0292_0FE11559B06FBC08">
&s;ometimes &s;erve me thus." "Do you know Mr. Kingly? Was it his pre&s;ence that cau&s;ed &s;uch violent emotions?" "Only that you call him Kingly, madam, I &s;hould &s;ay the gentleman who came in ju&s;t now was a Mr. Rainsforth, of Plymouth." "Is your name Howard?" &s;aid the lady vi&s;ibly agitated. I an&s;wered in the affirmative. "Then," &s;aid &s;he, "I can account for the exclamation with which he left the room. You are right in your conjectures Mi&s;s Howard, Rains|forth and Kingly are one and the &s;ame per|&s;on. He took my name on our union, of which I &s;uppo&s;e you were unacquainted. "I was indeed, a &s;tranger to it, madam, or I &s;hould not have pre&s;umed to have intruded here; pardon the involuntary confu&s;ion I have occa&s;ioned, and permit me to retire." "You are not as yet &s;ufficiently recovered," &s;aid &s;he, "to venture out. Pray, &s;top, and compo&s;e your&s;elf, and if it will not occa&s;ion a return of your di&s;order, we will &s;end for Mr. Kingly to take his breakfa&s;t." I was beginning to apologize for the di&s;agreeable interruption I had given, but &s;he &s;topped me. "I &s;hall not li&s;ten to a &s;yllable of excu&s;e. I am &s;ure it was unintentional, but I will not forgive it on any other terms than its never being mentioned in future."</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="029439_0293_0FE1155E500ED700">
Kingly, as I mu&s;t henceforth call him, was now &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t, I endea|voured to command my countenance; but I fear to little effect; I attempted to ri&s;e, when he entered the room, but my limbs re|fu&s;ed their office. He bowed and took his &s;eat in &s;ilence, a cup of tea was handed him: his hand trembled &s;o he could not rai&s;e it to his mouth. I did not dare lift my eyes, lea&s;t I &s;hould encounter his, I felt my face alterna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ely red and pale; and it was with difficulty I could re&s;train my tears. We were all &s;ilent for near five minutes. Mrs. Kingly &s;eemed the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed of the three, and at length ventured to &s;ay, "my dear Kingly you forget your politene&s;s to day, pray help Mi&s;s Howard to &s;ome muffin." "I believe," &s;aid he, "it is by &s;ome other name we mu&s;t addre&s;s this lady now." Surpri&s;e at what he uttered tempted me to rai&s;e my eyes with a kind of inqui&s;itive look." "My name is &s;till Howard," &s;aid I, "nor have the lea&s;t intention of altering it." "Were you not on the point of being married about two years &s;ince?" I was more a&s;toni&s;hed than ever at this que&s;tion. I knew not what to an&s;wer: to have menti|oned any thing of my intended union with Kingly before his wife, would perhaps have only &s;erved to make her unhappy. At length I an&s;wered, I was, it is true, near being mar|ried
<PB N="119" REF="029439_0294_0FE115648C197920">
about that time, but I had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e you, as well as the re&s;t of my ac|quaintance, knew the cau&s;e of the match being broke off. I have never had a thought &s;ince of altering my condition. "It is very &s;trange," &s;aid he, and the conver&s;ation drop|ped. I then began to recollect the rea&s;on which had brought me to the hou&s;e of a man whom I wi&s;hed, of all others, mo&s;t to avoid, and turning to Mrs. Kingly made the nece&s;&s;ary enquiries concerning the place I wanted to engage for. Having received an|&s;wers greatly to my &s;atisfaction, I aro&s;e to take my leave, referring her to Mrs. Sidney for my character. "I dare &s;ay there will be no nece&s;&s;ity to make tho&s;e enquiries," &s;aid &s;he, "but if you will mention any day when you will favour me with your company to dinner, I will introduce you to my aunt, who is fortunately now in town."</P>
<P>I told her if &s;he would favour me &s;o far, as to give me a line to Mrs. Rook&s;by, I would wait on that lady at any time &s;he would plea&s;e to appoint, but mu&s;t beg leave to decline the propo&s;ed honour of dining with her, as I feared it would not be po&s;&s;ible to di&s;engage my&s;elf from the kind friends with whom I at pre&s;ent re&s;ided, till an ab&s;olute &s;ettlement obliged me to leave them. Indeed, my dear Celia, I felt there would be a great impropri|ety
<PB N="120" REF="029439_0295_0FE1156A7AE92958">
in endeavouring to cultivate an intimacy with Mrs. Kingly, for &s;hould &s;he not have been acquainted with the connection that formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her hu&s;band and my&s;elf, and &s;hould by any means hereafter hear of it, &s;he might naturally &s;uppo&s;e I cul|tivated her acquaintance, that I might the more ea&s;ily enjoy her hu&s;band's &s;ociety; and if, as I &s;u&s;pect, &s;he already knows how near we were being united by the tendere&s;t ties, &s;he would certainly approve a conduct, which would &s;hew how much her happine&s;s was preferred to my own gratification. I will confe&s;s I wi&s;hed for nothing more than a conver&s;ation with Kingly, for I plainly per|ceived &s;ome my&s;tery couched beneath the few &s;entences that pa&s;&s;ed, while we were at breakfa&s;t: But this wi&s;h I was &s;en&s;ible would be both improper and imprudent to &s;eek to gratify. Mrs. Kingly having therefore nam|ed a day, when &s;he thought it would be con|venient for her aunt to &s;ee me, and menti|oned an hour when &s;he would call and take me to her, I took my leave. I &s;lightly re|garded Kingly's countenance, as I wi&s;hed him good morning, and di&s;covered in it &s;trong traits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> and impatience.</P>
<P>When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to Mrs. Sidney's, Amelia di&s;covere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by my looks the agitation of my mind. I thought it would be wrong to have
<PB N="121" REF="029439_0296_0FE10841ECD80E88">
any concealments from &s;uch worthy friends, I therefore briefly related all that concerned Rainsforth, and my unfortunate rencounter with him that morning. "Upon my word, Meriel," &s;aid &s;he, "every word you utter excites fre&s;h wonder. I remember hearing of the affair you mention, but it was always &s;poken of in &s;uch a ludicrous &s;train, that I have my&s;elf frequently joined in the laugh again&s;t you, con&s;idering you as a poor, fond girl, who fancied every man who but &s;poke a civil word was in love with you, and re|turned this imaginary pa&s;&s;ion with all the en|thu&s;ia&s;tic ardor of romantic affection." I made Mi&s;s Sidney no an&s;wer, but going to my trunk, returned with all the letters which had pa&s;&s;ed between Rainsforth and my&s;elf. "This proof of your fortitude and magna|nimity," &s;aid &s;he, when &s;he had peru&s;ed them, "was only wanting to complete my e&s;teem for your character; for, it is from the&s;e letters only, that I have learnt in what manner you di&s;po&s;ed of your fortune. Ge|nerous, noble &s;pirited girl, it is only for &s;uch hearts as yours to be tried in the ordeal of af|fliction; but &s;urely heaven has &s;ome future reward in &s;tore, that will amply compen&s;ate the &s;ufferings you are ordained to endure."</P>
<P>"Oh! my dear Amelia," &s;aid I, "have I not already an ample compen&s;ation in your
<PB N="122" REF="029439_0297_0FE115781CDE6568">
friend&s;hip and affection. Prai&s;es from your lips are balm to my wounded heart: may I never forfeit your e&s;teem." "That I am &s;ure you never will. I only blu&s;h to think how long I remained a &s;tranger to your me|rits; but the real diamond is always enve|loped in a cru&s;t, thro' which it is only on near in&s;pection, we can di&s;cover its intrin&s;ic value." "Ah! flatterer," &s;aid I, &s;miling, while the tear of grateful affection &s;tole from my eye. Oh! Celia, when I forget the friend&s;hip of Amelia Sidney, the benefits re|ceived from her hands, the mi&s;ery from which &s;he &s;natched me, may I be forgot by that Providence to whom we can only look for &s;upport. Ble&s;s her, all-bounteous hea|ven; make her felicity as boundle&s;s as the benevolence of her heart; let her comforts be many, and her afflictions few: and when this tran&s;itory &s;cene is pa&s;t, &s;oft and gentle be her pa&s;&s;age to the grave.

<P>And may you, my dear Celia, &s;hare the &s;ame envied fate. For me, I was born to bu&s;tle on a &s;ea of trouble; and &s;o as the buf|fetting waves do not deprive me of the

<P>KNOWING, my dear Celia's impati|ence to be informed of what followed my interview in Golden-Square, I &s;hall pro|ceed without any preface.</P>
<P>After the conver&s;ation I mentioned in my la&s;t, it &s;truck Amelia that Kingly would un|doubtedly

endeavour to &s;ee me, as his mind mu&s;t be in the &s;ame &s;tate of painful uncer|tainty in regard to my conduct, as I was, when I reflected on his. I told her I would by no means wi&s;h to &s;ee him, and reque&s;ted the &s;ervant might be permitted to deny me in ca&s;e any gentleman &s;hould call. Our mea&s;ures were but ju&s;t &s;ettled when a knock at the door announced a vi&s;itor, and by li&s;t|ening at the top of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, I plainly heard Kingly's voice. He &s;eemed much di&s;|appointed at not finding me at home, and left word he would call at twelve o'clock the next day: accordingly I wrote the follow|ing note to be delivered when he came.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MR. KINGLY.</HEAD>
<P>MISS HOWARD's compliments to Mr. Kingly; reque&s;ts as a particular favour, he will not give him&s;elf the trouble to call any more, as Mr. Kingly cannot be ignorant, that there are many forcible rea&s;ons exi&s;ting, which renders it totally improper for Mi&s;s H. to recieve his vi&s;its. She de&s;ires no expla|nation of pa&s;t incidents; &s;incerely wi&s;hes Mr. K. every felicity; but is certain any intercour&s;e between them, will not tend to promote it. It is that rea&s;on only, which urges Mi&s;s H. to avoid an intimacy with

the very amiable Mrs. Kingly, who&s;e hap|pine&s;s, &s;he devoutly prays may be perma|nent, and of long duration.</P>

<P>When he came, this note was delivered to him by the &s;ervant. He a&s;ked for pen and ink, and left the following.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MISS HOWARD.</HEAD>
<P>I AM convinced I have been decieved; an explanation is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to my repo&s;e. I find you are the &s;ame charming, delicate girl, I once adored; nay, which even at this moment I find dearer to my heart, than aught the world contains be&s;ide. Then, think not, I will &s;it tamely down, while you &s;uppo&s;e me an unfeeling, capri|cious mon&s;ter. There is one way, by which I can clear my&s;elf; there is one, who can plead my cau&s;e, and you not refu&s;e to li&s;ten. I re&s;pect that &s;en&s;e of propriety, which urges you to refu&s;e a per&s;onal interview; but I mu&s;t be re&s;tored to your e&s;teem, or be wretched for ever. Your friend,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The next morning Mrs. Kingly called as &s;he had appointed, and took me with her in the chariot to Mrs. Rook&s;by. This old
<PB N="126" REF="029439_0301_0FE1159122D77AB8">
lady is extremely plea&s;ing in her manner. Her per&s;on, tho' advanced in years, retains many traces of grace and elegance. She expre&s;&s;ed her approbation of me, in the po|lite&s;t terms, and &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould con&s;ider her&s;elf extremely fortunate in the acqui&s;ition of &s;uch a companion. Her terms were much more liberal than I had been led to expect; and as we were &s;oon agreed, &s;he reque&s;ted me to appoint an early day for my removal to her hou&s;e. "Bu&s;ine&s;s of a very particular nature," &s;aid &s;he, "required my pre&s;ence in London, which I have not vi&s;it|ed before for upwards of twenty years, nor &s;hall I now remain in it long; but while I do &s;tay, I &s;hall wi&s;h to enter into a few of its amu&s;ements, and I am certain I &s;hall re|ceive double &s;ati&s;faction from them all, when I am favoured with your company." It was then determined, that day week &s;hould be the time of my removal, and we took our leave. When I was again in the carriage with Mrs. Kingly, &s;he &s;aid, "it gives me great plea&s;ure to find my aunt is likely to make &s;o agreeable an addition to her family; nor have I the lea&s;t doubt, but you will be &s;atisfied with your &s;ituation, as &s;he is a wo|man of an ea&s;y, chearful di&s;po&s;ition. And now my dear Mi&s;s Howard, as we have &s;et|tled this important bu&s;ine&s;s, you mu&s;t give me leave to execute a commi&s;&s;ion, I ye&s;ter|day
<PB N="127" REF="029439_0302_0FE11596A8B96E28">
undertook. I have a letter for you," continued &s;he, &s;miling. "You may perhaps gue&s;s from whom. Come, no drawing back, I can a&s;&s;ure you there will not be the lea&s;t impropriety in your recieving it, and I flat|ter my&s;elf I have intere&s;t &s;ufficient to ob|tain an an&s;wer." She then put the letter into my hand. You may judge my confu|&s;ion. It was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak, for I was utterly at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay. I believe, I never looked more like a fool. Mrs. King|ly &s;aw my embarra&s;&s;ment, and kindly, did not &s;eem to expect me to &s;peak, but began a conver&s;ation on things quite foreign to the &s;ubject. When we arrived at Mrs. Sidney's door, &s;he refu&s;ed to alight; but wi&s;hing me a good day, &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould expect to hear from me &s;oon.</P>
<P>I ran up &s;tairs to Amelia, and putting the letter into her hand, cried, open it, read it for me, for indeed I have not re&s;olution to read it my&s;elf. Enclo&s;ed my dear Celia, is a copy of the letter; al&s;o of one from Mrs. Kingly, in which it was enclo&s;ed; when you have peru&s;ed them, I am &s;ure you will la|ment with your poor friend, that &s;uch merit as Rainsforth's, (for &s;till I love that name,) &s;hould be &s;evered from her, by the malice of tho&s;e, who could really reap no advantage from her di&s;appointment. Whatever were
<PB N="128" REF="029439_0303_0FE1159BDBB23D90">
the motives, that in&s;tigated the Mo&s;&s;ops to practice &s;uch an impo&s;ition on us both, they are undoubtedly di&s;appointed; for from the time of Rainsforth's marriage with Mi&s;s Kingly he carefully avoided all intercour&s;e with the family; the rea&s;ons for which you will find in his letter.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. MRS. KINGLY to MISS HOWARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March</HI>
9<HI>th,</HI> 1781.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I FEEL, my dear Mi&s;s Howard, that I am under an indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of writ|ing to you, to reque&s;t you will attend to the explanation &s;o ardently de&s;ired by Mr. King|ly; and from which your rigid &s;en&s;e of propriety, urges you to recede: but in what manner &s;hall I addre&s;s you, dear, amiable young lady, when I am &s;en&s;ible I have, tho' unknowingly, &s;tepped between you and hap|pine&s;s. Often have I heard your name, oft li&s;tened to your commendations, from lips which never &s;poke, but they conveyed plea|&s;ure to my heart.</P>
<P>My father's family lived in terms of the greate&s;t intimacy with that of Mr. Rains|forth's; Frederic and my&s;elf were nearly of the &s;ame age, were frequently together, we
<PB N="130" REF="029439_0305_0FE115A6D45AE830">
learnt to dance at the &s;ame &s;chool, and at our annual ball I was always &s;elected for his partner. Our infantine attachment was no|ticed by both our parents, and Frederic was often &s;milingly called my little hu&s;band. As we increa&s;ed in years, this attachment grew weaker on the part of Frederic, but in my bo&s;om it gathered new &s;trength; the many good qualities &s;o con&s;picuous in the boy, became dignified virtues in the bo&s;om of the man. I always wept when duty called him from his native place, and rejoiced un|feignedly at his return. When my uncle made me his heire&s;s, my parents began to &s;hew &s;ome di&s;approbation of my vi&s;ible par|tiality; and when I repeatedly refu&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;plendid offers, treated my pa&s;&s;ion with a rigour, which &s;erved only to make its im|pre&s;&s;ion on my heart more indeliable. Ju&s;t before old Mr. Rainsforth met with the mi&s;|fortune, which was, I under&s;tand, the fir&s;t cau&s;e of your &s;eparation from his &s;on. I lo&s;t both my parents within a very &s;hort pe|riod of each other, and became my own mi&s;|tre&s;s: I know not how to proceed, I am at a lo&s;s for words, in which I can acknow|ledge a weakne&s;s, which I fear you will con|demn; but anxious to re&s;tore peace to the bo&s;om of Rainsforth and pro&s;perity to his family; and perfectly unacquainted with his engagements to the amiable Mi&s;s Howard,
<PB N="131" REF="029439_0306_0FE115AC6FBCCF58">
I &s;o far over&s;tepped the bounds pre&s;cribed our &s;ex, as to write to him making a tender of my&s;elf and fortune: in&s;tead of writing an an&s;wer to this letter, he came him&s;elf, thank|ed me in the tendere&s;t manner for what he termed my generous de&s;igns in his favour; but declared his heart was under a prior engagement. He then expiated largely on the virtues of Mi&s;s Howard, and declared, tho' for the pre&s;ent, fortune had placed in|&s;uperable barriers to ob&s;truct your union, he &s;hould ever hold him&s;elf as bound to you, and while you remained &s;ingle, con&s;ider him&s;elf not at liberty to marry any other wo|man. He reque&s;ted that tho' unable to ac|cept the offered honour of my hand, he might not be deprived of my friend&s;hip, and declared he &s;hould always think on me with gratitude and affection.</P>
<P>From this time I &s;edulou&s;ly endeavoured to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion, which I found preyed upon my peace of mind, and when I heard of the fortune left his family flattered my|&s;elf I had &s;ucceeded: I &s;incerely rejoiced in the pro&s;pect of his felicity in an union with you, which he told me would now &s;oon be completed: but one morning he came to me in vi&s;ible agitation, and taking my hand, cried, "dear Margaret, I am di&s;appointed in my tendere&s;t hopes, Meriel Howard is mar|ried."
<PB N="132" REF="029439_0307_0FE115B14C5735D0">
I tried to per&s;uade him he had been mi&s;informed; but he &s;aid there was no room for doubt, as it had been confirmed by your own hand. He now vi&s;ited me every day, and I will confe&s;s to you, I exerted my&s;elf to divert his melancholy; I in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded; and one day as we were chatt|ing together on indifferent &s;ubjects, he &s;ud|denly caught my hand and cried, "if my lovely friend would accept the offer of a heart that was once devoted to another, happine&s;s might yet be my portion; but I dare not indulge &s;o &s;weet a hope." I will not repeat to you, Mi&s;s Howard, the many conver&s;a|tions we had on this &s;ubject; &s;uffice it to &s;ay we were &s;oon united. From that happy moment, his tenderne&s;s, his a&s;&s;iduity, has every day increa&s;ed: I &s;aw his heart &s;till beat true to its fir&s;t attachment; but I al&s;o &s;aw his &s;truggles to &s;uppre&s;s its emotions. He never indulged him&s;elf in talking of you, carefully avoiding every place where he might chance to hear your name mentioned. The violent agitation, which you was thrown into by his entering the room the other morn|ing, and an exclamation which broke from him, as he caught you, when you were falling to the ground, made me readily conceive who it was I had the honour to entertain. I felt for you both, more than I can expre&s;s: I had long been acquainted with your virtues, though a

The day after I fir&s;t had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, I per|ceived Mr. Kingly to be melancholy and ab|&s;ent. I pre&s;&s;ed to know the cau&s;e.

He then &s;hew|ed me your note, and a&s;ked, if he were to write a few lines, whether I would prevail with you to read them, and grant him an an|&s;wer. I readily promi&s;ed him to comply with this reque&s;t, and I hope, my dear Mi&s;s Howard, you will by an an&s;wer, re&s;tore peace to his bo&s;om; for I am well convinced, he will never be happy while he imagines you

<P>THAT you are &s;till unmarried, my dear Meriel, is to me the cau&s;e of great a&s;to|ni&s;hment; that you are depre&s;&s;ed in your circum&s;tances, and obliged to &s;eek by &s;ervi|tude the nece&s;&s;ary means to &s;upport life, gives the accute&s;t pangs to a heart, that ever wi&s;hed and would have rejoiced in your hap|pine&s;s.

I fear we have both been deceived; but why that deceit has been practi&s;ed again&s;t us, I am at a lo&s;s to think. I know you ne|ver were a favourite with the Mo&s;&s;op's. They envied virtues they had not &s;pirit to imitate; but why they &s;hould thus labour to render two unoffending beings &s;o com|pletely mi&s;erable, is altogether unaccounta|ble. I have, my dear friend, (the blu&s;h of &s;hame crim&s;ons my cheek while I write it) but I have doubted your virtues. I have thought you fal&s;e, capricious, light and un|de&s;erving: and much I fear, you have been taught to think me the vile&s;t of my &s;ex. But let me ha&s;ten to exculpate my&s;elf from &s;o black a charge. Let me trace back to the time that even at this moment my &s;oul &s;hud|ders to think upon.

<P>I cannot give you the lea&s;t idea of the poignancy o my feelings, or the madne&s;s of my actions, at this cruel, in&s;ulting letter. I was ab&s;olutely frantic: my father endeavour|ed to &s;ooth me. He had always expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;like at my propo&s;ed union with you, tho' for what rea&s;on I never could learn. He told me I ought to rejoice at having di&s;co|vered your light, changeable di&s;po&s;ition, before it was in your power to injure my honour. I li&s;tned to him with reverence;
<PB N="138" REF="029439_0313_0FE115D447B4AFD0">
I knew he never yet had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, which did not ultimately tend to my good: I endeavour to calm my tran&s;ports, and &s;trove to per&s;uade my&s;elf I &s;hould &s;oon hate you. I wrote you a long letter, wherein I gave vent to the angui&s;h of my heart. I then &s;ealed up all the dear pledges of your affection, and which till that moment had been pre&s;erved as the choice&s;t trea&s;ures I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and went to &s;eek Mo&s;&s;op.</P>
<P>"You did not tell me," &s;aid I, "your cou&s;in Meriel was married." "Dear Rains|forth," &s;aid he, "I had not courage to in|form you of her perfidy, as I knew you lov|ed the unworthy girl."

<P>From that time I carefully avoided, even the &s;ociety of Mo&s;&s;op, lea&s;t I &s;hould hear your name, and be tempted to break my re&s;olves; and in a very &s;hort time I yeilded to the entreaties of my friends, and gave my hand to the lovely, amiable woman, whom you have &s;een, and whom I am &s;ure you love; for her &s;oul is congenial with your own. Meriel, I will not pretend to &s;ay I had forgot you; but the engaging qualities of my wife, the innocent beauties of my children had in a great mea&s;ure, filled that void in my heart, which the lo&s;s of you had occa&s;ioned. Indeed, I had began to fancy my&s;elf happy, when your pre&s;ence and &s;ud|den illne&s;s, the other morning, awakened my long &s;tifled tenderne&s;s, convinced me I had been deceived, and that we both were de&s;tined to be mi&s;erable.</P>

<P>CAN you concieve, my dear Celia, the poignancy of my feelings when I had read this horrid detail of the impo&s;ition that had been practi&s;ed, thus to ruin the peace of Kingly and my&s;elf.

My re&s;olution in what manner to conduct my&s;elf was &s;oon formed.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD not the letter I have ju&s;t peru&s;ed been written in your hand, and delivered to me by Mrs. Kingly, I &s;hould be tempted to think &s;ome whining &s;chool boy had tried the extent of his genius in its compo&s;ition. In the name of common &s;en&s;e, my good friend, to what do the&s;e piteous complaints tend, or from whence do they proceed? are you not the hu&s;band of a woman, every way calcu|lated to make the connubial &s;tate a &s;tate of bli&s;s? have you not two lovely children, the pledges of her tendere&s;t affections; and has not Providence bountifully &s;howered its fa|vours on you? have you not health, ea&s;e and plenty? and yet &s;imple mortal, that you are, do you complain and &s;igh, becau&s;e you were not permitted to unite your fate with one, who, if you knew her half &s;o well as I do, you would find entirely de&s;titute of many of tho&s;e amiable qualities which &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;h Mrs. Kingly. For &s;hame Kingly, for &s;hame, you almo&s;t tempt me to laugh; your pre&s;ent conduct is like that of a &s;poilt child, who having in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion every valuable elegant toy his indulgent pa|rents can procure him, by chance di&s;covers
<PB N="143" REF="029439_0318_0FE115F0A3F0D228">
an in&s;ignificant trifle, which at &s;ome pa&s;t pe|riod had amu&s;ed his fancy; but being now out of his reach, he raves, blubbers and roars, throws from him with wild impetuo&s;ity, tho&s;e already in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and with the right, wayward &s;pirit of contradiction re|fu&s;es to be pacified. You are mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing young Mo&s;&s;op decieved you in re|gard to my character; nature formed me thoughtle&s;s, volatile and capricious: It is true, while you remained with me, I re&s;train|ed my natural levity; but no &s;ooner were you ab&s;ent than I relap&s;ed into my former folly, and innumerable are the giddy incon|&s;i&s;tent actions I have committed; among which, no doubt you will reckon my writ|ing &s;uch an unaccountable letter, merely to try the &s;trength of your pa&s;&s;ion; to be &s;ure, I did not think you would have re&s;ented it &s;o highly; but when I found that my folly was the means of promoting your intere&s;t, I heartily rejoiced in your felicity, nor once wi&s;hed to recall the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>You are in another error in &s;uppo&s;ing me unhappy. I am one of tho&s;e thoughtle&s;s, incon&s;iderate beings, who &s;eldom lay any thing long to heart.

It has &s;truck me, &s;ince our interview in Golden-Square, that you might, perhaps, imagine my illne&s;s was occa&s;ioned by your &s;udden appearance. Do not encourage that idea; it is a fal&s;e one. I am &s;ometimes &s;ubject to tho&s;e kind of fits; and they generally &s;eize me without a mo|ment's warning.</P>

Believe me, Kingly, true felicity is placed within your reach, take the proffered ble&s;&s;ing, and enjoy it with gratitude, nor let your own di&s;contented fancies da&s;h with gall the cup which Providence pre&s;ents, over|flowing with joy and peace. From the te|nor of your letter, I &s;hould think you a hero of romance, lamenting in pathetic &s;trains the di&s;appointment of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> love.

</LETTER>
<P>I will not pretend to tell you, what pain it co&s;t me, my dear Celia, to write a letter &s;o foreign to my feelings: to be obliged, as it were, to accu&s;e my&s;elf of folly and incon&s;i&s;t|ency; that would render me contemptible in the eyes of the only man, to whom I wi&s;h|ed to appear amiable. But there was no other way to re&s;tore his peace, there was no other way to pre&s;erve the happine&s;s of a wo|man, who not only loved him with the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic pa&s;&s;ion, but had placed an un|bounded confidence in me, and &s;hewn a friend&s;hip for me, which I &s;hould have cea&s;ed to de&s;erve, could I once have been &s;o mean as to envy her the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the man, who con&s;tituted the whole of her earthly felicity.</P>
<P>But tho' I wi&s;hed Kingly to remain in his error, I could not bear to be thought mean|ly of by this dear woman; I therefore took an opportunity, when I thought it mo&s;t like|ly he would not be at home, and waited on Mrs. Kingly.

&s;he would kindly believe I was not indeed the very incon&s;i&s;tent character I had repre|&s;ented my&s;elf, I then pre&s;ented to her a pa|per, briefly containing every circum&s;tance which had pa&s;&s;ed between Kingly and my|&s;elf, and enclo&s;ing the letter I had received, as I imagined, from his father. She read them with attention, and then declared it was not old Mr. Rainsforth's writing; &s;aid &s;he knew his hand perfectly well, and al&s;o, that he was a man incapable of writing &s;o inhuman a letter. "That there has been a &s;trange deception practi&s;ed, is very evident, my dear madam," &s;aid I, "but I make no doubt you will join me in thinking, it will be much better to conceal it from Mr. Kingly, as he would undoubtedly think as an officer and as a man of honour, he was under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of re&s;enting the ungenerous conduct of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op." "Dear, con&s;iderate girl," &s;aid &s;he, taking my hand, "how do you contrive to ri&s;e every moment higher in my e&s;|teem.

"Ah! deceiver," &s;aid &s;he, &s;mil|ing, "you cannot per&s;uade me, that the heart once tenderly attached to &s;uch a man as Kingly, can &s;o ea&s;ily regain its tranquili|ty. "But you do not reflect, my dear ma|dam, that I thought him a fal&s;e hearted &s;wain, and &s;trove with a laudable pride to ba|ni&s;h him from my remembrance." "True," &s;he replied, "but you are now undeceived." "Well, but believe me, it was too late to awaken the long &s;tifled pa&s;&s;ion. My heart is ju&s;t in the &s;ituation it was before I &s;aw him.

<P>"You are at a great di&s;tance from her then?" "So far, that we &s;eldom meet a|bove once in a year." This information plea&s;ed me, you may be &s;ure, my dear Celia, for I wi&s;h not to be often in company with Kingly. However, I did not expre&s;s my &s;ati&s;|faction, and Mrs. Kingly continued.

Her in|fluence over him is a&s;toni&s;hing, and her ex|travagance knows no bounds; the connecti|on, I believe, has been of long duration; but he has not publicly avowed it till within the&s;e two months.

<P>To-morrow, my dear Celia, I take leave of the amiable, friendly Amelia, and her worthy mother, and enter into Mrs. Rook&s;|by's family.

<P>I HAVE now been in this family nearly a month, and feel my&s;elf as happy as you can imagine, by contra&s;ting my pre&s;ent with my late friendle&s;s and de&s;olate condition. Mrs. Rook&s;by has &s;een a good deal of com|pany &s;ince I have been with her, and goes frequently into public. I find, my dear Ce|lia, that &s;en&s;ibility is not always an object of ridicule; for Mrs. Rook&s;by and Mrs. Kingly can &s;hed tears at a tragedy without endea|vouring to conceal, or blu&s;h for their weak|ne&s;s. I have received &s;everal very genteel pre&s;ents from the la&s;t mentioned lady, and whenever her aunt &s;pends a day with her in Golden-Square, I take that opportunity to vi&s;it Mi&s;s Sidney, and &s;o avoid a meeting which I am &s;en&s;ible cannot be very de&s;irable to any of the parties.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="029439_0327_0FE11621C9288F08">
I have not as yet &s;een Mr. Rook&s;by, but this evening his mother has a rout previous to her leaving town, and &s;he informs me he will certainly be their. The good old lady pathetically laments her &s;ons unfortunate attachment, &s;ays, &s;he is certain, from good information, that he is the dupe of an artful de&s;igning woman. "She has caught him in her deep laid &s;nare," &s;aid &s;he, "and he holds him&s;elf bound to her by gratitude and honour; for I am convinced real affection had little or no &s;hare in fir&s;t forming the connection. He fir&s;t became acquainted with her at Oxford, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed for the wife of an old coun&s;ellor. Her form, I am told, is very lovely, and it could not be &s;up|po&s;ed that a lad of nineteen, &s;hould repul&s;e, or fly the advances of a beautiful accompli&s;h|ed woman. When he came to town &s;he left her hu&s;band and two lovely children, and followed him, when a lodging was taking for her a few miles from London. When he went to the continent &s;he met him at Dover, and in&s;i&s;ted on going with him, and during their journey, the infatuated boy con&s;ented to her returning and living pub|licly with him in a hou&s;e he has taken for the purpo&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="029439_0328_0FE116282DA2F7D8">
"He has been acquainted with her &s;ome years, then," &s;aid I. "It is above three years," &s;he replied, "&s;ince he fir&s;t &s;aw her."</P>
<P>It is really a &s;ad thing, my dear Celia, that an abandoned woman &s;hould prey upon the fortune and de&s;troy the peace of this young man: yet if the tears and intreaties of a fond mother cannot break the fatal charm that holds him, &s;ure every other ef|fort will be ineffectual. But now my friend, I mu&s;t throw a&s;ide my pen, and be fine lady enough to declare it is for the purpo&s;e of dre&s;&s;ing, I begin to wi&s;h we were in the country, I am already &s;ick of parade, &s;hew and farce; for really a fa&s;hionable life is nothing better. How tire&s;ome to be plagued with the civil howdye's of fifty women, who are immen&s;ely happy to hear you are well, and would &s;ay, with the &s;ame <HI>&s;ang-froid,</HI> they were immen&s;ely &s;orry if they were told you were dead. Oh what a mi&s;erable figure I &s;hould make in the <HI>beau monde.</HI></P>
<P>21<HI>&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Really this Mr. Rook&s;by is a very tolera|ble being, and if I did not begin to fear he may be the cau&s;e of future vexation to me I &s;hould like to pa&s;s an hour or two in his company, now and then well enough. This morning at breakfa&s;t Mrs. Rook&s;by &s;aid
<PB N="154" REF="029439_0329_0FE1162DA3CC94D0">
"how happy my dear Mi&s;s Howard, &s;hould I be, if your charms and engaging qualities were to draw Clement from his unhappy en|gagement; I have indulged the mo&s;t plea&s;ing hopes from &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of admiration and &s;urpri&s;e, which broke from him on be|ing introduced to you la&s;t night." "They were merely words of cour&s;e, madam," &s;aid I, &s;miling, "when he knew I was honoured with your approbation, he could not be &s;o wanting in politene&s;s as to expre&s;s any di&s;like." "But what will you &s;ay my dear," &s;he replied, "when I tell you he has ab&s;olutely engaged him&s;elf to dine with me to day, a favour he has not vouch&s;afed above twice &s;ince I came to town." "We will hope, madam, he is returning to a proper &s;en&s;e of his duty."</P>
<P>"Ah! Meriel, I wi&s;h he may entertain a proper &s;en&s;e of your merit; how happy &s;hould I be in &s;uch a daughter; how certain would he be of happine&s;s, if ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a wife." "Dear madam, you over power me; you over rate my merits, and indeed I feel it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever love any man &s;ufficient to become his wife." "Come," &s;aid &s;he, "be candid, you can|not forget Kingly." "Indeed, madam, if I know my own heart, it never yet harboured an improper wi&s;h; I e&s;teem both Mr. and

Mrs. Kingly, but I &s;hould be extremely &s;or|ry to &s;ee any mi&s;fortune di&s;&s;olve their union, but let us drop the &s;ubject, I wi&s;h to remain &s;ingle; let me only enjoy your friend&s;hip my dear madam, and I &s;hall be the happie&s;t creature on earth."</P>
<P>At dinner time Mr. Rook&s;by arrived. I endeavoured to be unembarra&s;&s;ed in my manner, but after what had pa&s;&s;ed in the morning it was impo&s;&s;ible. He was atten|tively polite; but I &s;aw his dear mother watch every look, and &s;mile approbation, whenever any thing e&s;caped him that could be con&s;trued into tenderne&s;s. She pre&s;&s;ed me to play and &s;ing: &s;ome little drawings too, which &s;he has honoured by hanging in the drawing-room, were &s;ubmitted to his in&s;pection. "They are va&s;tly well execut|ed," &s;aid he. "Clara draws very prettily." "I hope," &s;aid his mother, "you do not make compari&s;ons." "A&s;&s;uredly I do," he replied ha&s;tily, "but every compari&s;on mu&s;t only convince me of Mi&s;s Howard's evident &s;uperiority, not only in every virtue, but in every accompli&s;hment." I hope, my dear Celia, this young man will not take it into his head to fancy him&s;elf in love with me. I never can like him; be&s;ides, I am deter|mined never to marry. Adieu, my dear

<P>THIS is a charming romantic place, my dear Celia. There is room for &s;olitude and deep reflection. Oak-hall is &s;ituated in a very retired part of the country, and has been the family man&s;ion of the Rook&s;by's from time immemorial. The hou&s;e is an|tique, and in&s;pires one's mind with the true &s;pirit of the days of chivalry. You cannot think, how often I amu&s;e my&s;elf with &s;ur|veying
<PB N="4" REF="029439_0334_0FE11641F73E9018">
its antique battlements, the ma&s;&s;y gates, and deep moat, that &s;urround it; and while I gaze with a kind of reverential awe, I fancy, I am perhaps retracing the &s;teps of many a gallant knight and beauteous dame who formerly have been inhabitants of this ancient dwelling. I am a great ad|mirer of every thing, that wears the face of antiquity not that I would, were I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ever &s;o large a fortune, lay out my money in purcha&s;ing a heap of trumpery, that are really of no intrin&s;ic value, only as the fancy of the virtuo&s;o &s;tamps them with the appel|lation of excellence, becau&s;e they were made &s;ome hundred years before we were born. I cannot deny, that I like to examine any little piece of antiquity, which tends to &s;hew us the progre&s;s of the arts or manufactures, and when I enjoy the benefit of any thing u&s;eful or convenient I feel a kind of vene|ration for the genius, who fir&s;t invented it, let it be ever &s;o mean or trifling.</P>
<P><HI>May,</HI> 20<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Rook&s;by arrived ye&s;terday and has this morning, not to my &s;urprize, but to my infinite regret, made me an offer of his hand and fortune. It is not, my dear Celia, that I am &s;toic enough to pretend, I have an aver&s;ion to being rai&s;ed from a &s;tate of de|pendence
<PB N="5" REF="029439_0335_0FE1164723B0B800">
to be mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;even thou&s;and pounds a year: but I feel, I &s;hall never re|gard Mr. Rook&s;by with the affection, which, in my opinion, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to make the married &s;tate comfortable, though Mrs. Rook&s;by tells me, that in this I am mi&s;taken, as &s;he was perfectly happy while her hu&s;band lived; and yet &s;he declares &s;he acceded to the union merely in compliance with the de&s;ires of her parents. It may be &s;o, Celia, but I am certain I &s;hould never be happy with a man, whom I regard with indifference. But I will give you an account of a conver&s;ation, I had this morning with this invader of my peace (I mu&s;t call him &s;o, for had it not been for him I &s;hould have felt my&s;elf quite happy in my pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion.) We had ju&s;t fini&s;hed breakfa&s;t, when a &s;ervant informed Mrs. Rook&s;by a poor woman de&s;ired to &s;peak with her. The good old lady is benevolent and humane to all her poor neighbours, and the hone&s;t indu&s;trious when oppre&s;&s;ed by mi&s;fortune are always &s;ure of meeting a friend in her.</P>
<P>I had not been alone with Mr. Rook&s;by before, &s;ince my re&s;idence in the family and to tell you the truth, I would gladly have walked ten miles to have avoided it now. But there was no flying; politene&s;s obliged me to &s;it &s;till; be&s;ides I thought it would
<PB N="6" REF="029439_0336_0FE1164B0546F7A8">
look &s;o like being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the man, &s;o childi&s;h to run away as &s;oon as his mother left the room&mdash;that I &s;at very compo&s;edly and took up my work, which opportunely was in the room.&mdash;We were &s;ilent near ten minutes, when at length he &s;poke.</P>
<P>"May I venture to enquire how Mi&s;s Howard likes the &s;ituation of my mother's hou&s;e?"</P>
<P>"I think it extremely plea&s;ant, &s;ir. It &s;uits the turn of my mind; I am fond of &s;olitude and &s;hould be quite happy were I certain of never wandering from this de|lightful &s;pot, to the gay regions of fa&s;hion, folly, and what is in general termed plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"How blind are you to your own merits, my dear Mi&s;s, if you wi&s;h thus to hide in ob&s;curity, beauty and virtue, that would do honour to a court."</P>
<P>"You make me &s;mile, Mr. Rook&s;by, how would your gay companions ridicule you could they hear you thus lavi&s;hly compli|menting an humble dependant of your mo|ther's."</P>
<P>"And let them laugh, my dear Mi&s;s. Howard, for did they know as I do the true
<PB N="7" REF="029439_0337_0FE116512BC86F60">
value of your worth, they would like me, adore it."</P>
<P>"This, my dear Celia, was not to be an|&s;wered: &s;o I was obliged to be content with remaining &s;ilent and looking like an idiot." While he continued, "I am fully &s;en&s;ible of my own unworthine&s;s of pre&s;uming to be|come a candidate for Mi&s;s Howard's favour. I know how full of error my &s;hort career of life has been; but I tru&s;t your benevolent &s;pirit will pardon my pa&s;t follies; and could I pre&s;ume to hope you would conde&s;cend to accept my hand and fortune, I am certain by a con&s;tant contemplation of the good|ne&s;s it would &s;trive to immitate, my heart would &s;oon be an offering worthy of your acceptance."</P>
<P>Dear Celia, how extremely embarra&s;&s;ing was my &s;ituation? I felt my face glow. I dared not look up: at length I &s;ummoned &s;ufficient courage to &s;peak.</P>
<P>"I hardly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ir, in what manner to reply. If the offer you have ju&s;t made be &s;eriou&s;ly meant."</P>
<P>"If it be &s;erious, Mi&s;s Howard, can you &s;uppo&s;e I would trifle on &s;o important a &s;ubject, with any woman, much more with
<PB N="8" REF="029439_0338_0FE116561EAD8BD0">
one &s;o truly amiable as your&s;elf. Believe me, my charming girl, there is no event could render me &s;o happy, or convey &s;uch unmixed felicity to the bo&s;om of my mother, as to &s;ee you become a part of a family which may derive honour from, but can confer none by the alliance."</P>
<P>"Your polite and generous propo&s;al, &s;ir, demands a candid an&s;wer. I feel my&s;elf in|finitely obliged by the regard with which you are plea&s;ed to honour me; at the &s;ame time I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of declining your offer. I hope you will believe I am not ungrateful for the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip I have fortunately met with in your mother's family, and permit me to add, I &s;hall always regard her as an affectionate parent and you as a brother: but as to any nearer tie, it never can take place between us."</P>
<P>"Never, Mi&s;s Howard. Do not &s;ay ne|ver&mdash;Time and con&s;tant a&s;&s;iduity will I hope influence your heart in my favour: for without that &s;weet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t be mi&s;era|ble."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Mr. Rook&s;by I cannot flatter you. It is at pre&s;ent my fixed determina|tion, never to alter my condition: but were that not the ca&s;e"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029439_0339_0FE1165C0AE696A0">
"Your choice would not fall on me. I am &s;ati&s;fied&mdash;Some more happy man."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, you are in an error. I am indifferent to all the &s;ex."</P>
<P>"Then why not allow me to &s;trive to awaken the &s;en&s;ibility of your heart. Be|lieve me your happine&s;s &s;hould be the whole &s;tudy of my life."</P>
<P>"Mr. Rook&s;by, I will be explicit. Were I ever &s;o partial to your virtues, I could not overlook one glaring error in your conduct, an error which not only tarni&s;hes your own reputation, but preys upon your mother's peace of mind."</P>
<P>"You mean my connection with Clara."</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>"Will you permit me, Mi&s;s Howard, to enter into a little detail of my conduct through the whole of this unhappy connec|tion. Unhappy! I mu&s;t always call it, not only from the rea&s;ons you have ju&s;t alledged, but becau&s;e I fore&s;ee my want of fortitude has involved an amiable woman in infamy and ruin; for had I repul&s;ed the fir&s;t over|tures of the unhappy Clara's pa&s;&s;ion, affront|ed
<PB N="10" REF="029439_0340_0FE116615F2FDF18">
pride would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in combating her attachment, and &s;he might at this mo|ment have been happy in the e&s;teem and love of her hu&s;band and family. I have often wi&s;hed to explain this affair to my mother and engage her friend&s;hip in behalf of Clara, but whenever I attempt to &s;peak, &s;he brands the poor girl with the epithets of artful, vile, enticing &s;iren. Alas, Mi&s;s Howard, the un|fortunate Clara's greate&s;t error is, a too tender attachment to me."</P>
<P>Ah man! man! &s;aid I mentally, how ea&s;ily does thy vanity, dupe thy rea&s;on,&mdash;Mr. Rook&s;by continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"It may appear old, that I &s;hould wi&s;h to enter upon this &s;ubject to you, but I am certain you will judge with candour and repre&s;ent Clara to my mother in &s;uch a light as may lead her to befriend a woman, who has &s;acrificed fame, happine&s;s, and honour to me. You will a&s;k, perhaps, why I do not marry her, as her hu&s;band is lately dead, I would an&s;wer, that &s;he is not a woman calculated to make me happy. Her temper is impetuous, and though her form is lovely and &s;he has received a poli&s;hed education, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not that true feminine &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy which in my opinion alone can render a woman really amiable. My ac|quaintance
<PB N="11" REF="029439_0341_0FE11666DA6BBF88">
with her commenced about four years &s;ince, while I was completing my &s;tu|dies at Oxford. At that time her hu&s;band Mr. Millar was a coun&s;ellor re&s;iding at that city. He invited me frequently to his hou&s;e. I &s;aw Mrs. Millar, and admired her as a lovely accompli&s;hed woman; nay more, I pitied her, for I &s;aw &s;he was not happy. Her &s;i&s;ter, Mi&s;s Ram&s;ay, who re&s;ided in the hou&s;e wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h her, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> me, their father had been a lieutenant in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> navy: but age and infirmities obliging him to retire upon his half pay, they found their circum&s;tances greatly &s;traitened. At this time, Mr. Mil|lar paid their father a vi&s;it. He was &s;truck with the beauty and innocence of Clara, and though at that time near fifty years old, he had the vanity to think he could render him&s;elf agreeable to a girl of &s;eventeen."</P>
<P>"Perhaps," &s;aid I, "it was a benevolent wi&s;h to lighten the expences of his friend and place the young lady in a &s;tate of in|dependence which urged him to make the offer of his hand."</P>
<P>It might be &s;o, &s;he replied, but what|ever his motives might be, gratitude and filial love incited Clara to accept the offer, and &s;acrifice her&s;elf to the man &s;he di&s;liked; to &s;ecure ea&s;e and affluence to her father
<PB N="12" REF="029439_0342_0FE1166C7A2D6EC0">
and &s;i&s;ter: but he lived not long to enjoy the fruits of her kindne&s;s. A &s;low decline carried him off about a year after his daugh|ter's marriage. At this time I was intro|duced into Mr. Millar's family. Clara was ju&s;t become a mother; her hu&s;band &s;eemed to idolize her; &s;he could not breathe a wi&s;h which was not in&s;tantly gratified. Yet &s;he was far from happy, and I often &s;aw her turn a&s;ide to conceal tears, which &s;eemed to flow from an oppre&s;&s;ed heart. One afternoon, Mr. Millar was from home, her &s;i&s;ter &s;itting at the other end of the room reading. Clara ro&s;e from her &s;eat on pretence of reaching &s;omething from the chimney piece, and &s;tooping, picked up a paper which &s;he pre|&s;ented to me, &s;aying, you drop your letters about very carele&s;sly. I took the paper and perceived it was a &s;ealed letter. I will not &s;hock your delicacy, Mi&s;s Howard, by re|peating the contents of this letter. I can perceive by your countenance, that you think it a &s;ufficient error for a married wo|man to entertain an inclination for any other man than her hu&s;band without daring to avow her pa&s;&s;ion. I am &s;en&s;ible, Clara acted with imprudence; but who can an&s;wer for the emotions of a heart, under the influence of its fir&s;t tender attachment? And however culpable, &s;he might be, I think my&s;elf more &s;o. I &s;hould have never more entered Mr.
<PB N="13" REF="029439_0343_0FE116722B6AB348">
Millar's hou&s;e, when I found how detrimen|tal my pre&s;ence was, both to his honour and happine&s;s. I &s;hould have avoided the &s;o|ciety of the fair &s;educer, and confined my|&s;elf more than ever to my &s;tudies. I am con&s;cious this &s;hould have been my conduct; but, alas! it was quite the rever&s;e. I &s;ought every opportunity of being in her company. I encouraged her growing tenderne&s;s. Pri|vate enterviews en&s;ued, and honour, grati|tude, and friend&s;hip were all forgotten. Though our entercour&s;e continued, during the whole time I remained at Oxford, Mr. Millar never &s;u&s;pected his injuries. The &s;i&s;ter was in our confidence, and &s;he always contrived our meetings in &s;uch a manner, that they appeared the effect of chance. Ju&s;t before I left Oxford, Clara was con|fined with her &s;econd child. This prevent|ed my taking a per&s;onal leave. I wrote, in|forming her of the nece&s;&s;ity of my removal, a&s;&s;ured her of my grateful affection and that I would take frequent opportunities of vi&s;it|ing her in future. This I &s;aid, merely to quiet her anxiety; for rea&s;on had began to operate; the mi&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion was di&s;&s;ipated and I was determined to put an end to a con|nection, at once &s;o di&s;honourable and unju&s;t. I cho&s;e to take the opportunity of her con|finement for my departure, as I knew how ill I could &s;upport taking a per&s;onal leave,
<PB N="14" REF="029439_0344_0FE1167646A35F10">
where tears, faintings, and hy&s;terics would effectually unbend my be&s;t re&s;olutions. I therefore entru&s;ted my letter to the &s;i&s;ter, without informing her of the contents, and &s;et forward immediately for London. I had not been in town above a fortnight, when one morning, as I &s;at at breakfa&s;t, I heard a chai&s;e &s;top at the door, and in a moment Clara ru&s;hed into the parlour where I was &s;itting.</P>
<P>Good God," &s;aid I, "Mrs. Millar what has brought you to town."&mdash;"What," &s;he replied, "what but your cruel de&s;ertion of me. Unkind, ungenerous Rook&s;by, did you think I would live &s;eparated from you."&mdash;"My dear Clara,," &s;aid I, "con&s;ider how your reputation will &s;uffer when this ra&s;h &s;tep is known"&mdash;" What is reputation to me," cried she, "if I am deprived of your love I lo&s;e all that can make life valuable."&mdash;"Where are your children, Clara,"&mdash;"I left them too, for your &s;ake, Rook&s;by; and is this cold, unkind reception all the return I am likely to meet."&mdash;"You call me cold, and unkind; but believe me, you wrong me, I feel all, nay much more than I ought for you, but I am very &s;orry to find you have &s;o little regard for your&s;elf as thus to incur the cen&s;ure of the world by follow|ing a man who has it not in his power to
<PB N="15" REF="029439_0345_0FE1167C32114E78">
offer you an honorable protection."&mdash;" You throw me from you, then. You will not receive me" (cried &s;he, &s;tarting up, and wildly cla&s;ping her hands,) Oh Rook&s;by this is more than I can bear&mdash;I am bur&s;ting&mdash;My heart is &s;wollen &s;o large; it choaks me.&mdash;" Be calm, I be&s;eech you, my dear Clara, I do not refu&s;e to receive you; no, my poor girl, I feel my&s;elf bound to protect you; for I know it was I fir&s;t drew you from your duty; but I am &s;en&s;ible, how little recom|pence it is in my power to make for the many comforts and ble&s;&s;ings I have robbed you of." "Oh Rook&s;by," &s;aid &s;he, "let me enjoy your &s;ociety, and be ble&s;&s;ed with your love, and I &s;hall not regret any &s;acrifice I have made."</P>
<P>What could I do, Mi&s;s Howard, conti|nued Mr. Rook&s;by.&mdash;There was but one way. I offered to take her a hou&s;e a little way out of town and vi&s;it her occa&s;ionally. She acceded to the propo&s;al and changed her name. Soon after her &s;i&s;ter came to town, and with her brought the two children, whom &s;he &s;aid Mr. Millar had in his re&s;entment turned out of doors.&mdash;I now con&s;idered my|&s;elf as bound to provide for the&s;e unfortunate children; but I had no idea of making my|&s;elf a re&s;ident in the &s;ame hou&s;e with their mother. But when I went over to France
<PB N="16" REF="029439_0346_0FE116815E4B7288">
this la&s;t autumn, &s;he followed me, and with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s declared &s;he would &s;ooner die than be &s;eparated from me for one week, that I was unable to refu&s;e the reque&s;t &s;he made to accompany me abroad. While we were on the continent we heard from her &s;i&s;ter, that Mr. Millar was dead.&mdash;From that time, Clara earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed me to marry her; but I told her not to form any &s;uch vain expectation, as that was an event, which never could take place; however I promi&s;ed always to be her friend, and in con&s;ideration of her then evident pregnancy, con&s;ented that on our return to England, I would take a hou&s;e in London and re&s;ide with her.&mdash;Alas! my dear young lady, I knew not what inconveniencies I was bringing upon my&s;elf:&mdash;Her expences far outran the annual &s;um I had allotted her; &s;he is never happy but when I am with her, and even when I devote almo&s;t my whole time to her, &s;he is peevi&s;h, di&s;&s;atisfied and con&s;tantly complaining of my altered carriage towards her. Alas, I know I am changed; but I am al&s;o certain I never failed in tender &s;olicitude, and attention to her welfare. I never did love her. Vanity, gra|titude, and the wild impul&s;es of youth have been mi&s;taken for that pa&s;&s;ion. I am now con|vinced of my error. My heart now vibrates with a true and ardent affection. I will never &s;uffer Clara to know want; but the future
<PB N="17" REF="029439_0347_0FE11686B43E5FD8">
happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of my life mu&s;t depend entirely upon Mi&s;s Howard.</P>
<P>I had li&s;tened attentively, during this re|cital. I found much to blame in Clara. In|deed, they had both been guilty of errors of &s;uch magnitude, that in my opinion they de&s;erved the appellation of crimes: but it was not for me to condemn. I knew from fatal experience, how imprudent were the dictates of a youthful heart. And though I felt a &s;ecret horror at the recital of Rook&s;|by's cruel perfidy, to his kind, un&s;u&s;pecting friend Mr. Millar, yet he appeared innocent in compari&s;on with Clara. Her hu&s;band loved her almo&s;t to adoration; he had rai&s;ed her from poverty to affluence; he had chear|ed the la&s;t hours of her father, and offered an a&s;&s;ylum to her orphan &s;i&s;ter. He was the father of her children, Celia. Yet could &s;he ungratefully betray the honour he had confided to her care; for&s;ake this kind, in|dulgent hu&s;band, de&s;ert her innocent chil|dren, in that helple&s;s &s;tate, when they require all a mother's fond &s;olicitude and anxious maternal care.&mdash;And for this inhuman con|duct &s;he pleads love. Celia! real love ne|ver yet incited its votaries to ba&s;e or di&s;ho|nourable actions. I am certain, I never could like Clara. She appears to me an artful de&s;igning woman, and from Rook&s;|by's
<PB N="18" REF="029439_0348_0FE1168C0C2413F8">
account, I think, intere&s;t has been the main &s;pring of her actions. Indeed, that alone urged her to follow him; for had &s;he regarded him with real affection, &s;he would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the idea of becoming a burthen to him: and do not, my dear Celia, think I am turning rigidly cen&s;orious, if I &s;ay, I &s;u&s;pect &s;he was not really the wife of Mr. Millar; though that takes but little from her guilt, as &s;he certainly had received many tokens of affection from him, and had been received and re&s;pected as his wife by all the families who lived in their neighbourhood. All the&s;e reflections had pa&s;&s;ed rapidly thro' my mind, while Mr. Rook&s;by was &s;peaking. When he pau&s;ed, I found my&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"You &s;ay, &s;ir, your heart is very deceit|ful: it has once betrayed you into actions and connections you now heartily repent. May it not do &s;o again. Tru&s;t not to its impul&s;e: call in the aid of rea&s;on and re|flection, and you will find your pre&s;ent in|clination will prove as great a delu&s;ion as the former."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" he replied, vehemently, "impo&s;&s;ible, I can never alter my opinion in regard to Mi&s;s Howard."</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="029439_0349_0FE11691729F2EC8">
"And believe me, &s;ir," &s;aid I, gravely, "it is equally impo&s;&s;ible I can ever alter mine in regard to you."</P>
<P>I then attempted to leave the room; but he caught my hand. "Stay, my dear girl, only one moment; let me intreat you, only to recall that cruel word never. Give me but the mo&s;t di&s;tant ray of hope and I will endeavor to be &s;ati&s;fied."&mdash;" Well, Sir," &s;aid I &s;miling, "if you remain of the &s;ame opinion you are now, forty years hence, I will talk with you further on the &s;ubject." He relea&s;ed my hand and turned from me in &s;ullen &s;ilence. I embraced the opportu|nity, and immediately quitted the apart|ment. But here was a fre&s;h &s;cene of per&s;e|cution to encounter. Mrs. Rook&s;by met me, as I went acro&s;s the hall, and taking hold of my arm, we walked into the garden. "I &s;ee, my dear Meriel," &s;aid &s;he, "you are not plea&s;ed; poor Clement has little to hope: but come tell me, have you given him a po&s;itive refu&s;al?"&mdash;My dear Madam, you already know my &s;entiments on that &s;ubject, I have no inclination for matrimony, I wi&s;h to remain &s;ingle; for I am certain I &s;hould never have patience &s;ufficient to &s;ubmit to all the whims and caprices of tho&s;e lords of the creation. "I am afraid Meriel, you deceive your&s;elf, and that under the idea of
<PB N="20" REF="029439_0350_0FE116970608F3D0">
a di&s;inclination for marriage, you nouri&s;h a hopele&s;s and de&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ion. I know my dear girl how nobly you have conducted your&s;elf in regard to Mr. Kingly. My niece has informed me of the whole: but my good girl, while you are thus &s;tudiou&s;ly promoting the happine&s;s of others, why neglect your own, why &s;acrifice the bloom and &s;pring of life to a pa&s;&s;ion, which however well placed, is now no longer innocent."</P>
<P>"Oh! Madam," I replied, "do not &s;u&s;|pect me of cheri&s;hing &s;o improper a de&s;ire; can I not be &s;uffered to pa&s;s quietly through the remainder of my life, without forming any other connection than friend&s;hip? Why mu&s;t I be obliged to undertake duties I am &s;o very unable to perform? Or why do you wi&s;h a heart long &s;ince dead to plea&s;ure, from whom every tender tie is now &s;evered, to have its &s;en&s;ibility again awakened, to have new affections; to make it again fond of life, only perhaps to experience again the acute pangs of lo&s;ing the beloved objects that had called tho&s;e affections forth?"&mdash;" My dear Meriel, you mu&s;t not argue thus; we are all born to encounter trouble."&mdash;" Alas! Madam, my &s;hare has already been almo&s;t beyond my weak power to &s;upport; for from the day in which I left the Convent till the pre&s;ent, I have not experienced one &s;o

happy that I could wi&s;h it to return, yet heaven knows I do not complain; but I wi&s;h not to engage in new &s;cenes."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t con&s;ider, Mi&s;s Howard, it is not for us to mark out the path we wi&s;h to tread, and cry I will not deviate from it. We are not &s;ent into the world to pa&s;s thro' it in indolence. Remember my love that life which is not in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;erviceable to our fellow-creatures, is not acceptable to our Creator. You in particular are &s;ent in|to the world, endowed with abilities to &s;hine in the re&s;pective characters of Wife, Mother, and the mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, and will you be the unprofitable &s;ervant and hide tho&s;e talents intru&s;ted to your care, for the com|fort of your friends and the benefit of man|kind in general"&mdash;</P>
<P>"But Clara, madam, I hope you will allow that is an ob&s;tacle?"&mdash;" It is only &s;o in your opinion: To me it is the great mo|tive of my earne&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ee Clement unit|ed to you&mdash;Clara &s;hall be amply provided for"&mdash;</P>
<P>"And her child?"&mdash;" We will take it home, &s;hould it be born alive, and I will &s;ee it &s;hall be properly educated and a hand&s;ome provi&s;ion made for its future &s;upport. Now

my dear Meriel, I think all your objections are removed." "You mu&s;t, dear madam, give me time for con&s;ideration, before I can determine on &s;o important a &s;ubject."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall not be hurried, my love, on|ly let me have your leave to bid Clement hope."</P>
<P>"Oh! do not I be&s;eech you, rai&s;e falla|cious hopes. It may not be in my power to realize them."&mdash;" Well then," &s;aid &s;he, "I will remain &s;ilent, till I have your leave to &s;peak." She then turned into another walk and I returned to the hou&s;e.&mdash;" And, now my dear Celia, how would you advi&s;e me to act. I fear, turn which way I will, I am &s;till in an error. Ah! my &s;weet friend, I cannot teach this &s;tubborn heart indiffer|ence toward Kingly, and &s;ure I am, whil&s;t I remain &s;ingle, my partiality will be ever the &s;ame. Should I marry, other ties and the important duties of my &s;tation will call my mind from this dangerous object: But then to give my hand and vow obedience to a man, whom my heart refu&s;es to love, is certainly an error; and what is wor&s;e, the irrevocable words, once pa&s;t, there will be no flying from my fate, however repug|nant it may be to my feelings. I will write to my dear Amelia on the &s;ubject; alio to

I know not why, but whenever I think of it, a cold chill runs through my veins, and my heart &s;inks within me: but I am grown &s;trangely fanciful of late. I am greatly altered &s;ince we-parted.

<P>YOU tell me, my dear Mi&s;s Howard, that my cou&s;in has, to your &s;urprize, declared a pa&s;&s;ion for you: it is your diffi|dence alone occa&s;ions that &s;urprize, as I fore&s;aw it was a circum&s;tance that would certainly follow your re&s;iding in the fami|ly: but, though my lovely friend, I &s;hould greatly rejoice to rank you in the number of my relations, I would by no means de|&s;ire that gratification, if it is to be purcha&s;ed at the expence of your peace of mind.&mdash;Clement has, it is true, an independent for|tune; but his mind is not formed for the approbation of one &s;o delicate as yours. I &s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;ee you rai&s;ed to a &s;ta|tion you was formed to adorn; but I can|not avoid the remembrance of your gentle|ne&s;s of &s;pirit which &s;eeks not in grandeur for content.

<P>I informed Mr. Kingly, as you de&s;ired, of my cou&s;in's offer. "Her mind," &s;aid he, "mu&s;t be &s;trangely altered, if &s;he can find the lea&s;t congenial particle in his; but &s;he is altogether an inexplicable riddle." Vexed to hear him &s;peak &s;o &s;lightingly, I was al|mo&s;t tempted to betray my tru&s;t and tell him how vilely you had &s;landered your&s;elf, but &s;hall I confe&s;s the truth, &s;elf-love pre|vailed. I could not bear to think he might perhaps be angry at my long concealment; and much as I e&s;teem and venerate my dear Mi&s;s Howard, I could not con&s;ent he &s;hould love even her, better than me. I will not give my opinion concerning your future conduct; though you conde&s;cend to a&s;k it. Of this I am &s;ati&s;fied, whatever your own good &s;en&s;e &s;hall re&s;olve upon, that will un|doubtedly be right.

<P>AND &s;o my little &s;entimental Meriel is really and &s;eriou&s;ly deliberating, whe|ther &s;he &s;hall accept a man with &s;even thou|&s;and a year, &s;hine forth in all the magnifi|cence of bridal finery, or remaining a cha&s;te ve&s;tal, breathing pure vows to the con&s;ecra|ted flame of her fir&s;t love, continue in a &s;tate of dependence to the end of her life.

Make ha&s;te and &s;end us &s;ome wed|ding favours, and next winter, let me have the plea&s;ure of pointing out your elegant equipage, as it pa&s;&s;es my window, to &s;ome of my inqui&s;itive acquaintance, and &s;aying, "that is my friend Mrs. Rook&s;by's carriage.

And now to be &s;erious concerning your letter, Mr. Rook&s;by ap|pears to me a weak young man; but there &s;eems great goodne&s;s of heart in him and I think it would be a charitable action to &s;natch him from ruin.&mdash;for inevetable ruin mu&s;t follow his connection with Clara.

And again, my love, con&s;ider what a relief it will be to the generous Mrs. Kingly to &s;ee you &s;o well &s;et|tled.

New &s;cenes will open to your imagination, pa&s;t &s;orrows will be for|gotten and the afflictions of the daughter &s;hall be amply repaid by the felicity of the mother. Ah! my dear Meriel, you mu&s;t marry, if it be only to experience the &s;u|perlative happine&s;s of having a daughter, who&s;e &s;oul &s;hall be the exact model of your own. Methinks too, my friend, you will feel your bo&s;om dilate with plea&s;ure, when you can call Mrs. Rook&s;by by the endearing name of mother. A heart like yours, &s;o formed for all the endearing ties of life when deprived of its natural relation, &s;eeks &s;ome one on whom to re&s;t its affection.

<P>WHEN I had read the&s;e letters, my mind &s;till wavering and irre&s;olute, I repaired to Mrs. Rook&s;by's dre&s;&s;ing room. I found her weeping. "Meriel," &s;aid &s;he, as I entered, "you are come in good time to comfort me. Clement has ju&s;t been with me. He leaves us to-morrow."</P>
<P>"To-morrow, Madam, that is much &s;ooner than he at fir&s;t intended."</P>
<P>"Yes, Meriel, and he leaves us with an intention that almo&s;t deprives me of rea&s;on."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="029439_0361_0FE116CC58A2E668">
"You &s;urprize me, what intention can he have formed, that gives you &s;o much anxiety."</P>
<P>"He is determined to marry Clara im|mediately on his arrival in London, that his child may be legetimated."</P>
<P>"Marry Clara," &s;aid I, with an emotion of a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"It is even &s;o my dear; he ju&s;t now told me he found it was in vain to hope any thing from you, and being deprived of the hope of your affection he knew love could have no part in any other union, he was determined that the claims of honour &s;hould be attended to, and his innocent child have not future cau&s;e to cur&s;e the au|thor of its being, &s;ince that being would, if he did not marry Clara, inherit infamy as its birth-right."</P>
<P>"I cannot think," I replied, "that ho|nour by any means obliges him to marry that woman. She certainly forfeited all claim to an honourable protector, when &s;he fled from Mr. Millar. I wi&s;h &s;he was well pro|vided for, and far from Mr. Rook&s;by, for I am cartain that inevitable mi&s;ery and ruin mu&s;t en&s;ue from a continuation of his pre|&s;ent

<P>"You will &s;ee him, Mi&s;s Howard, before he leaves Oak-hall. Let me beg of you, my dear girl, to exert all your eloquence, to per&s;uade him from &s;o fatal a &s;tep.

let me reque&s;t my dear friendly Mrs. Rook&s;by to attribute this re&s;olution to its proper cau&s;e. I will not deceive your &s;on with profe&s;&s;ions of affection which I do not feel. I have re|ceived many favours from you and your amiable niece Mrs. Kingly, and I think it will be to your mutual &s;ati&s;faction, to &s;ee me married. I am &s;en&s;ible, it is a duty al&s;o which I owe my&s;elf, as, whil&s;t I continue &s;ingle, I &s;hall always be &s;u&s;pected of nou|ri&s;hing an improper affection for Mr. Kingly, and as it is my earne&s;t wi&s;h to pre&s;erve my own reputation un&s;ullied and to promote as much as po&s;&s;ible the happine&s;s of others, I will unite my&s;elf to Mr. Rook&s;by, but alas, I have nothing to offer in return for his ge|nerous affection but e&s;teem and friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Enough my love," cried Mrs. Rook&s;by embracing me, "I have no doubt of Cle|ment's happine&s;s, when ble&s;t with the e&s;|teem of &s;o amiable a companion."</P>
<P>At dinner we all met as u&s;ual. Mr. Rook&s;|by was in his travelling dre&s;s. "Are you for riding this afternoon, &s;ir," &s;aid I&mdash;" I think of &s;etting forward for London, Mi&s;s Howard, I have an affair of infinite con&s;equence to tran&s;act there, and I fear delays may be dan|gerous."&mdash;" You mu&s;t not leave us to-night, however, Clement," &s;aid his mother &s;miling.

&mdash;" I did not under&s;tand you intended leav|ing Oak-hall till to-morrow," &s;aid I.&mdash;" I would willingly &s;tay here forever," he replied, "but I am &s;en&s;ible my pre&s;ence is detrimen|tal to the tranquility of one who&s;e happine&s;s I would promote at the hazard of my life."&mdash;This was a compliment, my dear Celia, which I could not take entirely to my&s;elf, as he might have meant Clara's happine&s;s was di&s;turbed by his remaining at Oak-hall, I therefore remained &s;ilent, and little more was &s;aid, till the cloth was removed. I then aro&s;e to leave the room with Mrs. Rook&s;by, who generally retires to her dre&s;&s;ing room after dinner, and as is often the ca&s;e with elderly people, indulges her&s;elf with a nap. As I aro&s;e Mr. Rook&s;by took my hand. "Permit me, Mi&s;s Howard, before I take my leave to reque&s;t the honour of a few minutes conver&s;ation."

<P>"It is with infinite regret, my dear young lady, that I leave this place, as by &s;o doing I relinqui&s;h every hope, which I had fondly cheri&s;hed of obtaining an intere&s;t in your bo&s;om.

<P>No, my dear Meriel, I &s;ee the generous drift of your de&s;ign. You pity me, you wi&s;h to make me happy and to oblige my mother would &s;acrifice your own felicity; but, my dear friend, if I have nothing to hope from affection, I will not be indebted to gratitude or compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"But, dear Mr. Rook&s;by, con&s;ider how you will di&s;tre&s;s your mother by thus pre|cipitately giving your hand to Mrs. Millar; You mu&s;t pardon me, &s;ir, but indeed I do not think her altogether worthy &s;uch an honour."</P>

women (added he &s;miling) are not always the mo&s;t candid judges of each other. You my dear Mi&s;s behold in Clara only a frail woman, who forgetful of the rigid dictates of honour and virtue &s;acrificed reputation, friends, every valuable con&s;ideration to an unhappy pa&s;&s;ion. I behold her as a lovely unfortunate creature, who has made tho&s;e &s;acrifices for me. I al&s;o con&s;ider that, per|haps, had it been her fate to be united to the man of her heart, &s;he would at this moment have been a re&s;pectable member of &s;ociety; and if I reflect, that I only am the cau&s;e, that &s;he is not &s;o, can I do otherwi&s;e than repair as much, as is in my power, the inju|ries her reputation has &s;uffered on my ac|count."</P>

the heart would not immediately follow, and were it not that I fear he will be ex|tremely unhappy in an union with Clara, I &s;hould rejoice in being relea&s;ed from his im|portunities. Mrs. Rook&s;by is in great af|fliction.

<P>WE have had fine bu&s;tling and con|fu&s;ion I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear Celia, &s;ince I wrote you la&s;t; and if you knew all, you would &s;ay, we are likely to have much more,&mdash;but not to go on with my intelli|gence too fa&s;t.</P>
<P>The morning after I concluded my la&s;t, Mr. Rook&s;by &s;et off for London. His mo|ther
<PB N="41" REF="029439_0371_0FE116FC16E315C8">
would not take leave of him at his de|parture, and I was obliged to con&s;ent that a corre&s;pondence &s;hould be commenced be|tween us; for &s;he had ab&s;olutely declared all intercour&s;e with her mu&s;t cea&s;e, from the moment he married Clara. Accordingly on the fourth day after his departure I re|ceived a letter, informing me he had arrived too late for his purpo&s;e: for Clara had been in bed two days, and little ma&s;ter was as fine a boy as ever was &s;een, and in perfect health. Mrs. Rook&s;by greatly rejoiced, that any thing had happened to po&s;tpone the wedding, and flattered her&s;elf the con|nection would by &s;ome means or other be broke off. It was near &s;ix weeks before we had any farther tidings of him, though I had an&s;wered his letter immediately. It was at the clo&s;e of evening; Mrs. Rook&s;by was re|clined on a &s;opha; for the weather was ex|tremely hot, and I was playing on the harp|&s;ichord which I accompanied with my voice. The evening was remarkably &s;till, the moon with &s;ilver cre&s;cent faintly illumined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ky, encrea&s;ing the beauty of the night by her pre&s;ence, without eclip&s;ing by too much radience the le&s;&s;er glories of the &s;tars.

When we were interrupted by the &s;ound of hor&s;es coming up the avenue, and in a few minutes Mr. Rook&s;by ru&s;hed into the room, pale and to all appearance worn out with fatigue. He &s;poke not at entering, but throwing him&s;elf into his mother's arms, bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>"Clement," &s;aid &s;he, "my dear Clement what is the matter. Good God! you weep, your hands are hot. You are very ill."&mdash;"Oh! mother," he replied, "forgive me. I know it is unlike a man, but the &s;hock I have received."&mdash;" Is Clara dead then," &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;" Clara, did you &s;ay, Oh the &s;i|ren, name her not, I cannot tru&s;t my&s;elf to &s;peak of her, &s;he is&mdash;but come we will not talk about her."</P>
<P>"You come upon us rather unexpected," &s;aid I, advancing towards him.</P>
<P>"I came," &s;aid he, "as fa&s;t as a repeat|ed change of hor&s;es would bring me, for I knew there was no other place, where I could find comfort. You, my dear Mi&s;s Howard will comfort me, and you will pre|vail with my mother, to receive under her protecting roof &s;ome poor little orphans who will arrive to-morrow to claim her care."</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="029439_0373_0FE11705EBDD3F80">
"You are &s;en&s;ible, Clement, that every child of affliction is welcome to me. I will protect and &s;erve them to the utmo&s;t of my power. How much greater then will be their claim on my humanity, when they come recommended by you."</P>
<P>"And when one of them is my child," cried he vehemently,&mdash;" my dear mother, that woman, whom I had intended to make my wife&mdash;but no matter, &s;he is gone. She has for&s;aken her poor little innocents; but I will not &s;uffer them to know want."</P>
<P>"You are not married then?"&mdash;"No"&mdash;"Thank heaven, my dear Clement, thank heaven, your honour will not &s;uffer by this cruel de&s;ertion, and let the vile mother go, we will protect the unoffending children."</P>
<P>After &s;upper, Mr. Rook&s;by was more compo&s;ed. He told us, that on his arrival in London he ha&s;tened to Clara and found her as he had informed us, the mother of a fine boy and likely to do well. He told her with what intention he had hurried to town, and &s;aid, if &s;he de&s;ired it, a &s;pecial licence &s;hould be procured and the ceremony per|formed in her own chamber. This &s;he for|tunately refu&s;ed alledging, that, as her di&s;|grace had been public, &s;he de&s;ired the repa|ration
<PB N="44" REF="029439_0374_0FE117095A9A4D80">
might be public al&s;o. To this he a&s;|&s;ented and preparations were making for the public performance of the ceremony. He had pre&s;ented her with a magnificent &s;et of jewels, and with money to the amount of three thou&s;and pounds. A day was appoint|ed for the union: the articles, &s;ettlements, &amp;c. were all ready for &s;igning: When the evening preceding the appointed morning he called at her hou&s;e and was informed &s;he was gone to a private ball &s;ome few miles out of town. He thought it &s;omewhat &s;trange, but knowing the volatility of her di&s;po&s;ition and how extremely fond of every thing that wore the &s;emblance of plea&s;ure, it did not &s;o much &s;urprize him. The next morning he repaired to her at the time ap|pointed, a new equipage, &s;ervants in new liveries with white and &s;ilver favours arrived at the door. The gue&s;ts began to appear when enquiries were made for the bride.&mdash;Mr. Rook&s;by went up to ha&s;ten her. She was not in her dre&s;&s;ing-room. He called for her woman: &s;he was not to be found.

It is ea&s;y to conceive the pa&s;&s;ion this in|famous &s;crawl created in the bo&s;om of Rook&s;by. He was in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;ins of rage for putting an immediate period to his exi&s;tence. Shame, vexation, and di&s;ap|pointment drove him to the verge of di&s;|traction. At length he recollected the child of whom he is extremely fond. He called for it, declared that the mother's guilt &s;hould never be revenged on her innocent off&s;pring, and in care&s;&s;ing the little cherub, in &s;ome mea&s;ure compo&s;ed the perturbation of his &s;pirits. The company di&s;per&s;ed, he &s;ent away his chariot, and returned to his lodging in a hackney-coach, where he undre&s;&s;ed and ordering po&s;t hor&s;es, &s;et forward immedi|ately for Oak-hall, leaving his own man to follow with the nur&s;e and children. The elde&s;t, who is a girl, I am told is at &s;chool in a village near Oxford, where Mr. Rook&s;ky has every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the care taken of her education and morals. He means, he &s;ays, that &s;he &s;hall have a u&s;eful education, and will &s;ettle on her a thou&s;and pounds, the intere&s;t of which is to be appropriated to her &s;upport. The two boys, he will bring up together and by a liberal education fit them for one of the genteel profe&s;&s;ions, the choice of which &s;hall remain with them&s;elves. To them al&s;o he will give a thou&s;and pounds each; but
<PB N="47" REF="029439_0377_0FE1171873E51478">
they are both to be called by the name of Millar. This is certainly a noble &s;pirited young man. It is a pity he has not more firmne&s;s of temper; but he is as weak as an infant and as ea&s;ily per&s;uaded by per&s;ons who rightly under&s;tand his di&s;po&s;ition. Awa|ken his gratitude or make a claim upon his honour, and you may lead him as you plea&s;e. This is far from the kind of tem|per that I like. Were I ever &s;o much at|tached to Mr. Rook&s;by, I &s;hould be afraid of profe&s;&s;ing it, lea&s;t it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed I meant to take an undue advantage of his ea&s;y nature, and I &s;hould, if married to &s;uch a man, avoid &s;hewing a thou&s;and little kind|ne&s;&s;es, lea&s;t I &s;hould &s;eem to demand more than &s;imilar attentions from him. There is another trait in his character, which I have lately di&s;covered. He is vain and rather addicted to jealou&s;y; and I can perceive there is no part of Clara's conduct hurts him more &s;everely, than finding her &s;o totally in|different&mdash;and when he imagined her &s;trong|ly attached to him&s;elf, to know her capable of eloping with another.</P>
<P>And yet, my dear Celia, this very man with all his errors, they have &s;ome how or other among them drawn me into a &s;ort of promi&s;e to marry. Mrs. Kingly wrote and my dear Amelia wrote too.&mdash;Mrs.

Rook&s;by pleaded, and Clement him&s;elf, looked &s;uch eloquent things, that what with the grateful remembrance of his genero&s;ity, toward me, which I forgot to tell you his mother in&s;i&s;ted on my accepting, and a &s;ort of pity for his late di&s;appointment, I expe|rienced a kind of &s;entiment which I know not how to di&s;tingui&s;h. It is more lively than e&s;teem, and yet I am &s;ure it is not love. However, be it what it may, the die is ca&s;t, and I believe Rook&s;by will be the man with whom I am de&s;tined to pa&s;s my life. The &s;ettlements, &amp;c. prepared for Clara, his mother declares &s;hall remain for me, as blanks had been left for the names. I do not agree to this point; as I think the &s;ettlement by far too large. I think it very nece&s;&s;ary a proper provi&s;ion &s;hould be made in ca&s;e of a large family, but as I have no fortune, it would be unju&s;t as well as unge|rous to accept a &s;ettlement of &s;even hundred a year. This I am re&s;olved to over rule.&mdash;Three hundred will be more than &s;ufficient. On this condition alone, will I give him my hand, for it &s;hall never be &s;aid the poor Meriel Howard aggrandized her&s;elf at the expence of the Rook&s;by family.

<P>The day on which I gave him my hand, was indeed to me a tremendous one.&mdash;Kingly was pre&s;ent, nay he even gave me to his cou&s;in. I trembled when he took my hand, a faint &s;icki&s;h &s;en&s;ation come over
<PB N="51" REF="029439_0381_0FE1172B72949008">
me: but I rallied my &s;pirits and went through the ceremony tolerably well. My dear Ame|lia, whom you might &s;uppo&s;e would be pre|&s;ent on this important occa&s;ion, kept up my &s;pirits during the re&s;t of the day. Mrs. Kingly looked happy, but it was a kind of &s;ati&s;faction tempered with fear.&mdash;"I hope" &s;aid &s;he," pre&s;&s;ing my hand, "I hope the aera of your felicity may be dated from this propitious day."&mdash;"Mo&s;t certainly it will," cried Amelia, "for who ever heard of mi|&s;ery in a coach and &s;ix."&mdash;"Oh!" replied Mrs. Kingly, with great energy, "there is much greater mi&s;ery in them than tho&s;e who lack the goods of fortune will readily ima|gine, aye, my dear Mi&s;s Sidney, and the wor&s;t kind of mi&s;ery too, &s;uch as wealth cannot relieve or grandeur alleviate."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Amelia, laughing, "I declare we have cho&s;en a brilliant topic for a wedding day, but pray let us change it. I was al|ways more inclined to become a di&s;ciple of the laughing, rather than the weeping phi|lo&s;opher."</P>
<P>When it drew near dinner time and I found I mu&s;t de&s;cend into the drawing room, I trembled from the idea of being pre&s;ented to about half a hundred &s;trangers, who would compliment, and critici&s;e at a
<PB N="52" REF="029439_0382_0FE1172FA8CB1998">
mo&s;t unmerciful rate; the one to my face, the other behind my back, and believe me I would &s;ooner li&s;ten to the latter than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> former: for compliments have in general little or no meaning and of cour&s;e are mere in&s;ipid trifles. Now in li&s;tening to the cri|tici&s;ms of our friendly neighbours, who perhaps did not intend we &s;hould over hear them, we di&s;cover our faults, and may learn how to amend them; but the mi&s;fortune is, few will take the trouble to point out our errors to us, while every one is ready to flatter our &s;elf love, by commending us for qualifications to which we have little or no preten&s;ions, and, if they think, we believe their a&s;&s;ertions, the moment we quit them they will laugh at our credulity. Well! my dear Celia, I never could bring my&s;elf to make compliments, or fine &s;peeches to people, whom I did not think de&s;erved them. But to return to my &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
<P>I got through the day tolerably well, and now our gue&s;ts begin to think of returning to their re&s;pective homes. It is propo&s;ed, that we &s;tay at Oak-hall till the latter end of November. Mrs. Rook&s;by has prevailed on Mrs. Sidney to remain with her, during the winter, while Amelia accompanies me to town. I am va&s;tly plea&s;ed with the ar|rangement, as the &s;ociety of that dear girl
<PB N="53" REF="029439_0383_0FE1173459137EA0">
will be a great comfort to me. I find Rook&s;|by has given orders for a hou&s;e to be fitted up in a &s;tile of the utmo&s;t elegance, as he intends we &s;hall always pa&s;s the winters in town and the &s;ummers with his mother at the Hall. He talks of much grandeur and gaity. I am &s;orry for it, I think his ta&s;te very expen&s;ive; but it is not my place to &s;peak. I am determined to regulate my own expences, by the &s;trict rule of economy, void of par&s;imony. Even was the wealth my own, I have no right to &s;quander it away in unnece&s;&s;ary trifles, and as it is not, I mu&s;t be &s;till more careful. My allowance for pocket money, cards, &amp;c. is extremely li|beral, and I hope always to order it in &s;uch a manner as to have a &s;ufficient &s;um by me, to a&s;&s;i&s;t depre&s;&s;ed merit, or re&s;cue &s;uffering innocence from oppre&s;&s;ion. I hope, my dear Celia, elevated as my pre&s;ent &s;ituation is, I &s;hall never forget the u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons taught me in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity; and &s;urely, whil&s;t the remembrance of my own &s;ufferings are retained, my heart will never be rendered callous to the &s;ufferings of others. Oh! My beloved friend, dearly indeed &s;hould I pur|cha&s;e the &s;miles of fortune, if I am to lo&s;e my humanity. Benificent Ruler of the Univer&s;e, teach me to value the ble&s;&s;ings bountifully &s;howered upon me, by con|&s;tantly remembering my own de&s;erts; and

whenever I meet an afflicted fellow-creature, let my heart &s;hew its gratitude to Thee, by dropping the tear of &s;ympathy, and granting the tribute of relief."&mdash;I am certain, Celia, they who have never known adver|&s;ity, cannot truly enjoy pro&s;perity. I forgot to tell you, that Kingly left us the day after we were married. Mrs. Kingly &s;tays, till we all go to London. When we are &s;ettled there, I will write you again; but you mu&s;t not expect any great variety in my letters; I mu&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e, at fir&s;t enter into the gai|ties of the metropolis, but I am determined not to be &s;o infatuated as to give up my whole time to them. I will have my hours of peace and retirement: for in my opinion the life that is &s;pent in a continued round of in&s;ipid plea&s;ures, is not only entirely u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ociety, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure guilty, as we can have no time for the performance of tho&s;e duties, which are incumbent on every profe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;tianity; nor do I think as many do, that people of a certain rank in life may pa&s;s their time in any way mo&s;t agreeable to them&s;elves, and that they are not accountable for it to any one. We certainly are an&s;werable to one, who will demand an account of our &s;teward&s;hip at a time, when no eva&s;ion whatever will &s;erve our turn: and the more elevated our &s;ta|tion, the more careful we &s;hould be to

&s;et examples worthy the imitation of our inferiors. Examples that may in&s;pire all, who know us with a love of virtue, be an honour to our&s;elves, and a benefit to &s;ocie|ty in general.</P>

<P>I HAVE been in town above a week; but could not command an hour to devote to friend&s;hip and Celia. Indeed, I have been &s;o taken up with mantua-makers, mil|liners and toymen, I hardly know what ac|count to give of the la&s;t &s;even days; then what with here and there a particular friend, who reque&s;ted to be admitted, before my appearance at court gave the &s;ignal for the whole town to come and pa&s;s their opinion on my hou&s;e-furniture, &amp;c. I have been wearied to death with a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of impertinant vi&s;itors, who are thus over polite, for no other rea&s;on than the eager de|&s;ire they have to report the di&s;coveries they make in regard to my per&s;on, dre&s;s and
<PB N="57" REF="029439_0387_0FE1174721B4A598">
manner, to the whole circle of their acquain|tance; but in this they have been &s;adly di&s;|appointed, for I have received them all in a &s;mall back drawing-room, and have never yet varied my dre&s;s from a neat di&s;habille.</P>
<P>I am now &s;ummoned to the drawing room: &s;ome new &s;et of inqui&s;itives, I &s;up|po&s;e, well, I mu&s;t attend; for people of fa&s;hion live not for them&s;elves, but others. They are afraid to perform any action, if unfa&s;hionable, though ever &s;o right, lea&s;t they &s;hould be laughed at: and for the very &s;ame cau&s;e dare not refu&s;e to do any thing to which fa&s;hion gives a &s;anction, though rea|&s;on tells them it is wrong, and &s;hould be avoided.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t leave you Celia.</P>
<P>And who do you imagine my vi&s;itors were? Now would I venture to lay a con&s;iderable wager, your mind would glance over the whole circle of my acquaintance, without being able to gue&s;s the right. So to &s;ave you the trouble of conjecture, I will at once inform you. They were no other than my kind aunt Mo&s;&s;op and her two amiable daugh|ters. I do declare, Celia, when I &s;aw them in the drawing room I ab&s;olutely blu&s;hed for
<PB N="58" REF="029439_0388_0FE1174BB5EEF608">
them. However, they did not &s;eem to ex|perience any embarra&s;&s;ment; but paid their compliments with the &s;ame ea&s;y air, as if nothing had ever interrupted our intimacy; only with this difference, their language and manner was more re&s;pectful.</P>
<P>"You have been very fly, my dear," &s;aid my aunt, "never to let us know where you were all this time, and then to blaze upon us all at once a &s;plendid bride."</P>
<P>"I thought, madam, after the death of my father, you would feel but little inte|re&s;ted about the fate of his daughter, for whom you never appeared to have any great degree of partiality."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, Mrs. Rook&s;by, you are va&s;t|ly mi&s;taken. I was always extremely partial to you, and I am &s;ure He&s;ter and Su&s;an have talked of you many times, &s;ince la&s;t we had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you. We wondered what had become of you."</P>
<P>"I have &s;een a variety of &s;cenes," &s;aid I, "nor would it have been in the lea&s;t probable &s;hould meet with &s;o advantageous a &s;ettle|ment as I have, had it not been for the friend&s;hip of a young lady, whom I have once or twice &s;een at your hou&s;e, and who
<PB N="59" REF="029439_0389_0FE11750D7691A60">
at pre&s;ent does me the honour to make one of my family." I then rang the bell, and de&s;ired the &s;ervant to inform Mi&s;s Sidney we reque&s;ted the favour of her company. I &s;aw my cou&s;ins look at each other when Amelia's name was mentioned, Mrs. Mo&s;&s;op changed countenance. "Ble&s;s me," &s;aid He&s;|ter, "I was thinking of Mi&s;s Sidney, the other day: but we have been in town &s;o very lit|tle while, we have &s;een nobody&mdash;this is po&s;i|tively the fir&s;t vi&s;it we have made." When Amelia entered the room, I &s;aw &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed: I al&s;o &s;aw the con&s;traint and confu&s;ion which my vi&s;itors vainly endea|voured to hide under the ma&s;k of extreme plea&s;ure at the accidental meeting. How|ever, as I imagined, my cou&s;ins courted my notice merely in the hope of &s;ometimes be|ing of my parties, and throwing them|&s;elves in the way of men of rank and for|tune, I gave them a general invitation to my hou&s;e, and I &s;incerely wi&s;h the event may an&s;wer their &s;anguine expectations, as it would give me great &s;ati&s;faction to &s;ee them married to worthy men, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fortunes capable of &s;upporting them in the manner to which they have been accu&s;tomed, and which I fear they could not continue, was their father to die before they are &s;et|tled; as he could not leave them a large fortune, having in general lived up to the

However he has forgot me. I often think of him; I pray for his health and pro&s;perity, and &s;hould rejoice to &s;ee him return with an indepen|dence &s;ufficient to place him in a re&s;pecta|ble &s;ituation.&mdash;Oh Celia, this continual round of vi&s;itors, by no means &s;uits the ta&s;te of your friend.

<P>MY little Clementina, is grown the fine&s;t girl you can imagine; and I a&s;&s;ure you, grandmamma is not a little proud of her darling. I wi&s;hed the dear little charmer to have been called Frederica, but I dared not &s;ay &s;o, lea&s;t it &s;hould be thought improper. La&s;t night, my dear Amelia arrived: her &s;pirits are greatly de|pre&s;&s;ed by the death of her excellent mother, but as &s;he will be happy in the friend&s;hip and protection of Mrs. Rook&s;by, I hope &s;oon to &s;ee her chearfulne&s;s re&s;tored. I have got &s;uch a habit of &s;eizing every lei&s;ure moment to &s;cribble to my Celia, that I often
<PB N="62" REF="029439_0392_0FE1175F0397E430">
take up my pen, when I have really nothing to &s;ay. You rejoice, you tell me to find my happine&s;s increa&s;e. Indeed, my dear friend I experience a much larger &s;hare than &s;ome years &s;ince, I could have imagined would have ever fallen to my lot. Mr. Rook&s;by is &s;till the kind, the attentive hu&s;band, and the birth of my little girl &s;eems more &s;trong|ly to cement our union.</P>
<P>You cannot think, how &s;urpri&s;ed I was a few days before we left town. Mr. Rook&s;|by had been out in the morning, and on his return told me he had met with an old friend whom he had invited home to din|ner." He is a man," &s;aid he, "with whom I formed an acquaintance when we were both boys at the &s;ame &s;chool together, I have not &s;een him for &s;ome time, but I al|ways thought him a worthy fellow, and am now happy in the renewal of our intimacy." He did not mention the name of his friend. You may judge therefore what was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when ju&s;t before dinner a &s;ervant announced Mr. Belger. I know not why it was, but I felt my&s;elf &s;tange|ly embarra&s;&s;ed while he was paying his com|pliments. Mr. Belger too was &s;urpri&s;ed, and looked aba&s;hed at the unexpected ren|counter, for I had not &s;een him &s;ince the cold wet night when we parted at the
<PB N="63" REF="029439_0393_0FE117644DE0CF88">
end of Ken&s;ington. However, I imme|diately acco&s;ted him by name and turning to Mr. Rook&s;by endeavoured at a &s;mile, while I &s;aid, "This is an old acquaintance of mine too, though I dare &s;ay Mr. Belger had not the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of &s;eeing me here." I then enquired after Mrs. Belger and Emma.</P>
<P>"Emma is abroad in a convent, madam," he replied&mdash;"and, her mother"&mdash;He he&s;i|tated, and I at that moment perceiving he was dre&s;&s;ed in &s;econd mourning, in&s;tantly under&s;tood his meaning. I felt my eyes fill. I remembered her gentlene&s;s and affection, and I al&s;o remembered how ill that affection had been requited.</P>
<P>"And pray, my dear," &s;aid Mr. Rook&s;by, "where were you acquainted with my friend Belger?"&mdash;At Ken&s;ington," I replied.&mdash;</P>
<P>"At Ken&s;ington!" &s;aid he with vi&s;ible emo|tion "Did you know many per&s;ons there."</P>
<P>"Very few, indeed; for at that time I was not in a &s;ituation to receive many vi&s;itants."</P>
<P>I did not choo&s;e, my dear Celia, to men|tion having known Mrs. Moreton; as &s;he was undoubtedly a woman of light character,
<PB N="64" REF="029439_0394_0FE1176723826C70">
the being &s;uppo&s;ed, an intimate of &s;uch a woman, would by no means contribute to rai&s;e me in Mr. Rook&s;by's opinion, I there|fore endeavoured to give the conver&s;ation a different turn, and dinner being &s;oon after announced, it a&s;&s;i&s;ted my de&s;ign, and we &s;poke afterwards only on indifferent &s;ubjects.&mdash;I am by no means plea&s;ed with Belger's being on an intimate footing in our family, he is not a proper companion for Rook&s;by, I am certain he is of libertine principles, fond of gaming and di&s;&s;ipated in his manners, yet greatly as I di&s;like him, I dare not mention it to Mr. Rook&s;by, as he &s;eems extremely fond of him and places the mo&s;t implicit confidence in his honour, and has actually invited him to pa&s;s &s;ome weeks this &s;ummer with us here, I am mortified and vexed, Amelia laughs at me, when I mention my anxiety and &s;ays, he will now be fearful of in&s;ulting me by any mention of his love. While I was unprotected he could treat me with di&s;re&s;pect, without fear of being called to an account, now it is quite a different affair.&mdash;Indeed, Celia, this is not what I dread, but I think if Mr. Rook&s;by &s;hould by any means hear how intimate we once were, he would be di&s;plea&s;ed, and it might be the cau&s;e of great unea&s;ine&s;s between us, I &s;hall take particular care to avoid all op|portunities of being entertained alone by this

<P>Since I began my letter I have been &s;o agitated and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed I found my&s;elf totally unequal to the ta&s;k of fini&s;hing it. Now I have &s;at down for that purpo&s;e, I hardly know how to arrange the extraordinary events that have happened within the&s;e la&s;t twelve days, not am I certain that you, my dear Celia, will entirely approve of my con|duct; yet &s;ure you will not greatly condemn me: for your gentle heart is benevolence it&s;elf. On the evening of the day on which I began my letter, I could not but ob&s;erve that Mr. Rook&s;by was extremely thoughtful and grave, a thing with him very uncommon, as his u&s;ual demeanor is chearful, and his conver&s;ation lively.&mdash;Once or twice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thought (for I ob&s;erved him narrowly,) I &s;aw the tears &s;tart in his eyes, he &s;ighed deeply and often. His mother remarked his want of &s;pirits and inquired if he was well. His an&s;wer was, "yes madam, very well, but rather out of &s;pirits, I &s;hall be better to-mor|row, do not pay any attention to it."&mdash;I thought it was be&s;t not to &s;peak, lea&s;t urgent inquiries might encrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> rather than relieve

his evident depre&s;&s;ion; and in ca&s;e any family affair had occa&s;ioned his unea&s;ine&s;s I was &s;en&s;ible he would not choo&s;e to mention it before his mother and Amelia.&mdash;I therefore determined to let it re&s;t, if he thought it right that I &s;hould be informed of the cau&s;e, he would the fir&s;t convenient opportunity communicate it; if not, it would I naturally &s;uppo&s;ed only increa&s;e his vexation to be teized with impertinent inquiries. When we retired he &s;poke but little, &s;eemed buried in thought, and I am certain, &s;lept little all night. This was too much&mdash;I felt my heart partake of his unea&s;ine&s;s, though I was ignorant of its origin. I longed to lighten his anxiety by participation;&mdash;Yet, feared to be trouble&s;ome.&mdash;After breakfa&s;t perceiving his dejection rather in|crea&s;e than dimini&s;h, I followed him into the &s;hrubbery, and finding him &s;itting in a melancholy, mu&s;ing po&s;ture, &s;eated my&s;elf be&s;ide him, and laying my hand on his arm, &s;aid with a voice, that evidently &s;poke my tender &s;olicitude&mdash;</P>
<P>"Rook&s;by you are not happy."</P>
<P>"I am not, indeed, my dear Meriel, I am very far from it; but do not let it interrupt your tranquillity. The cau&s;e of my pre&s;ent dejection will &s;oon be removed, and then I

&s;hall again enjoy with plea&s;ure the &s;ociety of the be&s;t of wives; but at pre&s;ent, my love, I mu&s;t reque&s;t you to leave me, as I am unfit for conver&s;ation."</P>
<P>"And can you, Rook&s;by, think me wor|thy of the flattering appelation you ju&s;t now gave me, and yet &s;uppo&s;e me capa|ble of pre&s;erving my tranquillity while I &s;ee you unhappy."</P>
<P>"You know, my &s;weet girl, I think you all, that is good and amiable in woman, and it is for your peace of mind I would endeavour to hide my unhappine&s;s."</P>
<P>"But as you connot hide it from the eye of affection, then refu&s;e me not the plea|&s;ure, my dear Rook&s;by of at lea&s;t participa|ting. If I cannot alleviate your anxiety, &s;urely you cannot fear to place a confidence in the cho&s;en friend of your heart."</P>
<P>"Oh no! but I know it will give you no plea&s;ure to be informed, nay, I fear it would rather make you unhappy in an emi|nent degree."</P>
<P>"Then it is &s;omething of great con&s;e|quence either to your honour or intere&s;t, or perhaps to both: if &s;o, I mu&s;t one day

<P>"And, is that all!&mdash;fye! Rook&s;by, fye! could you think that would give me a mo|ments pain. Believe me were it in my pow|er to be of the lea&s;t &s;ervice to Mrs. Millar, I would in&s;tantly fly to do it.</P>
<P>"Angelic goodne&s;s! but could you in|deed forgive her."</P>
<P>"I have no right to call her too account, my dear Rook&s;by, for her errors: but tell me, is &s;he in di&s;tre&s;s. If &s;o, I know &s;he is my fellow creature, and it is my duty to relieve her."</P>
<P>"Meriel," (&s;aid he catching me in his arms) while tears of exultation bur&s;t from his eyes, "you &s;urpa&s;s even the elevated idea I had formed of your prudence and virtue, Clara is in di&s;tre&s;s, I met her ye&s;terday, with &s;carce|ly cloaths to &s;hield her from the inclemency of the weather.

<P>"Merciful heaven, &s;aid I, (while my eyes overflowed,) why have I been kept thus long in ignorance, were is &s;he, let us go, my dear Rook&s;by, &s;hall I quietly enjoy the luxuries of life while poor Clara is in want of even the nece&s;&s;aries."</P>
<P>"I relieved her at the time, my love. Do not feel &s;o acutely, I even promi&s;ed again to &s;ee her; but my heart &s;mote me, I thought &s;hould it reach your ears, you would think me the ba&s;e&s;t of mankind."</P>
<P>I &s;hould think you &s;o, indeed, were you capable of beholding unmoved the mi&s;eries of a woman, with whom you once lived on terms of the greate&s;t familiarity: but we are lo&s;ing time. Let us ha&s;ten to the poor &s;ufferer. Who knows, but we may lead her back to the paths of virtue? But hold! You &s;hall go alone, Rook&s;by. She may con&s;ider my pre&s;ence as an in&s;ult."</P>

"She mu&s;t, if &s;he reflects at all, my dear Meriel, think it the highe&s;t conde&s;cention; and if you will be &s;o generous as to vi&s;it and promi&s;e her your protection, I will write her a note to prepare her for the in|terview, and you &s;hall &s;ee her in the after|noon."</P>
<P>"You will accompany me then?"</P>
<P>"No, dear girl, I will not. After what has pa&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible to doubt either your delicacy or genero&s;ity. You &s;hall act entirely as your own heart directs. I am &s;ure by leaving you to its dictates, Clara will have no rea&s;on to complain: but let me intreat you not to mention this affair, either to my mother or Mi&s;s Sidney. I am &s;ure they would blame the generous ardour with which you e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the un|fortunate Clara."</P>

About five o'clock the chariot came to the, door, and Rook&s;by handed me in, telling me the coachman knew where to drive, I can|not &s;ay but during my little ride, I under|went great agitation of &s;pirits, I am certainly doing right, thought I, in offering my protec|tion to the unfortunate Clara, and did not hu|manity point out my duty, &s;elf-intere&s;t would urge me to a performance of it, for &s;hould I not prove a friend to Clara, Rook&s;by undoubted|ly would; and &s;en&s;ible, as I was, of the undue influence &s;he once had over him, I could not but fear, that influence might again be ex|erted to his ruin: Be&s;ides, &s;aid I, who knows but Clara, had &s;he been ble&s;t with friends to direct her, and coun&s;el her aright might at this moment have been a &s;hining member of &s;ociety.

of it.&mdash;Fully occupied by the&s;e and &s;imilar reflections, I hardly perceived what route the carriage had taken, till it &s;topped at the door of a &s;mall neat cottage. A whole&s;ome looking young woman pre&s;ented her&s;elf. I enquired for Mrs. Millar and was &s;hewn into a parlour and informed &s;he would wait on me immediately. I was &s;carcely &s;eated when the door opened, and (judge if po&s;&s;ible my &s;urprize,) Mrs. Moreton entered.&mdash;An exclamation of wonder e&s;caped me. Oh! Madam, &s;aid &s;he, and unable to articulate more, &s;unk on the neare&s;t chair, covered her face with her hands and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>"Be not alarmed," &s;aid I, in the gentle&s;t accent I could a&s;&s;ume, "you have nothing to fear from me. But tell me do you live in this hou&s;e, and are you any ways connected with the unfortunate Mrs. Millar."</P>
<P>"Oh! dear lady," &s;aid &s;he, (&s;inking on her knees and rai&s;ing her &s;treaming eyes to my face) "I am that unhappy wretch, I am that ungrateful mon&s;ter who have injured (though Heaven knows involuntarily,) the very wo|man, who now generou&s;ly comes to &s;ave me from de&s;pair."</P>
<P>I was greatly affected, my dear Celia, I rai&s;ed the afflicted penitent, and bade her be comforted.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="029439_0404_0FE1179769C78E80">
"Comfort!" exclaimed &s;he vehemently, "Alas! where can a wretch, who&s;e crimes are &s;o multiplied as mine, find it?"</P>
<P>"It is never denied to the truly penitent: and I hope you will experience its benign influence."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall! I begin to feel it already dawn on my benighted &s;oul. It comes admini&s;|tered by an angel's hand."</P>
<P>I then made &s;ome enquiries concerning her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and reque&s;ted to be informed, in what manner I could render her &s;ervice which would be mo&s;t acceptable.</P>
<P>"You cannot, my dear Madam," &s;aid &s;he, "judge how far I am worthy your com|pa&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s you will permit me to acquaint you with the chief incidents of my pa&s;t life. I know at this moment, I appear to you an unworthy unprincipled wretch. When I think of the &s;ituation, in which I left you at Ken&s;ington, I cannot but reflect how lit|tle I &s;hould expect from your hands. Nay that my very life is in your power, but when I &s;hall inform how much I &s;uffered for the unintentional injury I did you, I flatter my|&s;elf you will pity and forgive me."</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="029439_0405_0FE1179CA882E920">
"But I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t," &s;aid I, "that you do not enter upon this detail till your &s;itua|tion is rendered more comfortable than it is at pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>"Permit me," &s;aid &s;he, interrupting me, "to remain at this cottage a few days. In that time, I will endeavour to commit to your peru&s;al a written account of my mi&s;e|rable life, from the earlie&s;t period of recol|lection till now.

<P>The agony her countenance expre&s;&s;ed, as &s;he uttered this, is not to be de&s;cribed. I felt her &s;olitary, forlorn &s;ituation, and while the tear of &s;ympathy trembled in my eye, I breathed forth the accents of con&s;olation.&mdash;When &s;he grew more compo&s;ed, I aro&s;e to take my leave;&mdash;but was &s;adly at a lo&s;s how to offer the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I was &s;en&s;ible &s;he wanted, without hurting her feelings. At length I ventured to draw forth my pur&s;e. She laid her hand on my arm&mdash;"That is entirely needle&s;s." &s;aid &s;he, "Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by has been very liberal. Let me not be

"I have one reque&s;t to make dear madam," &s;aid &s;he "&s;uffer me then to decline this offered favour in hopes you will grant me the one nearer my heart."&mdash;"Name it," &s;aid I.&mdash;"It is," &s;he replied, "that you will forbear men|tioning the circum&s;tances that pa&s;t at Ken|&s;ington to Mr. Rook&s;by, till you have re|ceived my letter. After that you will think of me with more clemency than you do at pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>I bade her be quite ea&s;y in that re&s;pect, and leaving the pur&s;e on the table returned to the Hall, where I found Mrs. Rook&s;by and Amelia wonderfully curious to know where I had been. "To keep a particular appointment I a&s;&s;ure you," &s;aid Clement, "and as I am the only confident, that is tru&s;ted in the affair, I beg you will not be inqui&s;itive concerning it; for I have promi&s;|ed &s;ecrecy."</P>
<P>He did not make any enquiry of what had pa&s;&s;ed at our interview, but pointedly avoided the &s;ubject. The next morning he pre&s;ented me with two hundred pounds, &s;ay|ing,
<PB N="77" REF="029439_0407_0FE117A59E02FFA8">
"My dear Meriel's expences may at this time be greater than u&s;ual. Make u&s;e of this my love, and &s;hould you require more, you know where to apply." This &s;um I &s;hall look upon as the property of Clara, and when we have &s;ettled &s;ome plan for her future &s;upport, it &s;hall be appropria|ted entirely to her u&s;e. I was very impatient for the promi&s;ed letter, as I imagined it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for her to extenuate a conduct &s;o unju&s;t and cruel as hers had been toward me; but re&s;olved at all events to judge as candidly as po&s;&s;ible, and extend toward her a friend|&s;hip, which may awaken in her mind a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of her pa&s;t errors, and lead her im|perceptibly to the love and practice of virtue.

<P>THOUGH I have taken up my pen to ad|dre&s;s the mo&s;t benevolent woman on earth, I &s;hudder to think in what a de&s;picable light I &s;hall appear.&mdash;Oh! Madam, the heart not entirely rendered callous by guilt, &s;hrinks from the &s;crutinizing eye of &s;uperior virtue, yet painful as the ta&s;k is, I feel it is a duty I owe, to you, to my&s;elf, and to my dear for|&s;aken children.&mdash;I am not, madam, as my &s;i&s;ter-in-law repre&s;ented to Mr. Rook&s;by, the daughter of a decayed officer; Alas! my friend&s;hip with this cruel &s;i&s;ter, has been the chief cau&s;e of all my guilt and mi&s;ery. My father was a gentleman of genteel fortune, and un&s;ullied reputation. I was his only child, and at the age of thirteen having lo&s;t my mother was placed at a boarding &s;chool near Oxford, where I received a genteel edu|cation; and to my utter regret formed an acquaintance with Eleanor Ram&s;ay, &s;he was
<PB N="79" REF="029439_0409_0FE117AF1FAFD100">
five years older than my&s;elf and was a teacher in this &s;chool, &s;he had an expen&s;ive ta&s;te for dre&s;s, and was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of gaiety and plea&s;ure. My father made me a liberal al|lowance for my pocket expen&s;es. Eleanor was not &s;o amply &s;upplied, &s;he told me that her father had been dead for &s;ome years and her mother's income was extremely confined tho' &s;he &s;trained it to the utmo&s;t in order that her&s;elf and brother might have the benefit of a liberal education.&mdash;Young Ram|&s;ay was a genteel engaging youth, and at that time employed in the &s;tudy of the law. He frequently came to vi&s;it his &s;i&s;ter, and &s;ometimes took her to places of public enter|tainment, in which excur&s;ions I was impru|dently allowed to accompany them. Ram&s;ay pretended to be &s;truck with my per&s;on; but I have &s;ince been convinced the fortune my father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and of which I was &s;uppo&s;ed heire&s;s, was the chief incentive to the pa&s;&s;ion he &s;o ardently profe&s;&s;ed. Eleanor was plain in her per&s;on, but artful and in&s;inuating in her manner. She con&s;tantly contrived par|ties of plea&s;ure, in which I was included: and in return I &s;upplied her with money to pur|cha&s;e any article of finery which her own narrow allowance would not afford.&mdash;</P>
<P>In this manner we proceeded till I reached my &s;ixteenth year, when on receiving a &s;um|mons
<PB N="80" REF="029439_0410_0FE117B403A07B68">
from my father to prepare to quit &s;chool entirely, Ram&s;ay and his &s;i&s;ter &s;hewed &s;uch marks of affliction at our approaching &s;epa|ration, the former declaring his exi&s;tence depended on my con&s;tancy and affection; that giddy, thoughtle&s;s, and ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, I con&s;ented to an elopement and accom|panied the&s;e fal&s;e friends to Scotland, where I &s;ealed my&s;elf the mo&s;t wretched of wo|mankind, by uniting my&s;elf to an unprinci|pled wretch, in who&s;e whole family there was not one atom of honour or genero&s;ity.&mdash;On our return we ha&s;tened to my father and humbly reque&s;ted his pardon and ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;Alas! I had forfeited all claim to both. He &s;purned me from him, and declared he would never &s;ee my face again. Over|whelmed with affliction, I had now no cour&s;e to take, but to repair with my hu&s;band to Lon|don to his mother and &s;i&s;ter, who, I thought, received me very coldly, con&s;idering how ea|gerly they had &s;trove to promote the union. Even Ram&s;ay him&s;elf was much altered in his manner and I began to perceive, that they con|&s;idered me as a burthen. I wrote a mo&s;t pe|netential letter to my father, reque&s;ting to be received, and offering to quit a man, whom I found my heart was by no means attached to; but the an&s;wer I received was, that as I had voluntarily quitted his protection for that of a hu&s;band, and taken the liberty to
<PB N="81" REF="029439_0411_0FE117B913B51AE0">
choo&s;e for my&s;elf, without con&s;ulting him on the propriety of my choice, I mu&s;t take the con&s;equence of my precipitancy: but, he feared, if I paid as little regard to the duties of a wife, as I had done to tho&s;e of a daughter, my hu&s;band would &s;oon have rea|&s;on to repent our union. He enclo&s;ed me a note for two hundred pounds, declaring it was all I mu&s;t ever expect, as he had made his will in favour of a &s;i&s;ter's &s;on then abroad in the navy. This money proved a &s;ea&s;on|able relief, as Mrs. Ram&s;ay's affairs were greatly deranged; but it was &s;oon expend|ed, and I was again reduced to bear the ill|nature of all the family; for Ram&s;ay never entertained a thought of giving me even an apartment to my&s;elf, nor indeed was it in his power, as he had no employment by which we could hope to be &s;upported. We had been married about a twelve-month, when he received an offer of accompanying a young gentleman abroad. This he eager|ly accepted, and I was left with Mrs. Ram|&s;ay. My &s;ituation was as uncomfortable as you can po&s;&s;ibly imagine, I had not money even for nece&s;&s;ary expences, and I could not help perceiving, that even my food was grudged by my mother-in-law. I thought once more of making a per&s;onal application to my father, but to my great affliction he at that time died &s;uddenly, and all hi|property
<PB N="82" REF="029439_0412_0FE117BBEB7A8610">
devolved to the relation I have al|ready mentioned. Though Mrs. Ram&s;ay's finances were very confined, &s;he lived in an expen&s;ive manner, kept a good deal of com|pany and went frequently into public. One night being with her at the play, we were acco&s;ted by an elderly gentleman, who &s;at in the box with us, &s;hewed us many civilities during the evening, and when the entertain|ment was ended, in&s;i&s;ted on &s;etting us down at our own door in his carriage, I thought there was an impropriety in accepting the&s;e civilities from a perfect &s;tranger; but as my mother and &s;i&s;ter acquie&s;ced, I knew it would only be deemed prudery in me to re&s;i&s;t.&mdash;I, therefore, followed their example, and &s;tep|ed into the carriage. When we arrived at home, the gentleman a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to enquire after our health the en&s;uing morning, which was granted. On our entering the hou&s;e I began to rally Eleanor on the con|que&s;t &s;he had made, as I naturally imagined the&s;e civilities were intended for her, but Mrs. Ram&s;ay cried with more good humour than I had heard her &s;peak for &s;ome time.&mdash;"No, no! my dear, Eleanor has no right to the glory of the conque&s;t, I fancy it is you, my pretty Clara, who have attracted the old gentleman's notice; Eleanor's per&s;on is not adapted for making conque&s;ts.&mdash;"I hope you are mi&s;taken, madam," I replied;
<PB N="83" REF="029439_0413_0FE117C1DA087590">
"for I &s;hould greatly rejoice in any good fortune which may happen to my &s;i&s;ter. For my own part, my lot is ca&s;t."</P>
<P>The next morning, Mr. Millar (for it was he, who had acco&s;ted us the night before) called, and after chatting &s;ome time on in|different &s;ubjects, offered to take us that evening to Ranelagh. From this time an in|timacy commenced, and I &s;oon really un|der&s;tood, that my unfortunate per&s;on had been the object of his pur&s;uit. It was in vain I remon&s;trated on the impropriety of a married woman li&s;tening to overtures of love. Mrs. Ram&s;ay treated the remon&s;trance as folly and romance. What &s;hall I &s;ay, my dear madam, ill treated at home, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in my circum&s;tances no friend near to whom I could apply for advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I in|&s;en&s;ibly gave way to the delu&s;ions of &s;plendor and affluence, and one evening at a ma&s;que|rade con&s;ented to my ruin.&mdash;A few days af|ter this fatal night, I went with Mr. Millar to Oxford, which was the place of his re&s;i|dence. Eleanor accompanied me and I a&s;|&s;umed the name of Millar. As I had not received a line from my hu&s;band &s;ince his departure from England, I imagined he had totally forgot me and would be as happy to be relea&s;ed from the burthen of maintaining
<PB N="84" REF="029439_0414_0FE117C539BBD0D0">
me, as he once pretended he &s;hould be in obtaining my hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Millar was extremely fond of me, I endeavoured as much as was in my power to return this affection with gratitude; but alas! madam, I was far from happy. Con|&s;cious guilt had fixed her fangs in my bo&s;om and knowing my&s;elf unworthy the attentions I daily received from the virtuous part of my &s;ex. I began to envy a &s;uperiority, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of which had given me &s;o much pain; but though I was far from hap|py I had not yet ta&s;ted the mi&s;ery of loving one object, while I felt my&s;elf bound to another. That &s;uperlative exce&s;s of angui&s;h was re&s;erved for me, 'till accident introdu|ced Mr. Millar to Mr. Rook&s;by. I will not repeat the &s;teps I took, (tears of contrition bathe my cheeks while I write it) to deceive the worthy Mr. Millar, and indulge my ten|derne&s;s for Rook&s;by. Suffice it to &s;ay I gave a loo&s;e to love, and experienced its effects with more violence, as it was the fir&s;t time my heart had ever been &s;en&s;ible of the pa&s;&s;ion; and certain it is, when we have taken one &s;tep in guilt we never pau&s;e at a &s;e|cond or a third, when either intere&s;t or plea|&s;ure urges our pur&s;uit. You have no doubt been informed of my leaving Mr. Millar and following Mr. Rook&s;by to town; I
<PB N="85" REF="029439_0415_0FE117CAC86F1A78">
&s;hall therefore pa&s;s over every circum&s;tance that en&s;ued until my acquaintance with you, (then Mi&s;s Howard) at Mrs. La Cours, and your &s;ub&s;equent removal to Ken&s;ington. At that time I had relinqui&s;hed the name of Millar; but as I had an invincible aver&s;ion to that of Ram&s;ay, and Mr. Rook&s;by refu|&s;ed me his, I a&s;&s;umed my own maiden name of Moreton. While I re&s;ided at Ken&s;ing|ton, I received Mr. Rook&s;by's vi&s;its very privately, as he was anxious for me to pre|&s;erve my character, and I wi&s;hed to appear to you in the light of an amiable woman. I &s;aw you regarded me with e&s;teem, and I knew your heart too well to &s;uppo&s;e that e&s;teem would be continued, if you knew I was a &s;lave to guilty pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Believe me, deare&s;t, be&s;t of womankind, I never enter|tained an idea to your di&s;advantage. I wi&s;h|ed from my &s;oul to promote your welfare, and have taught my heart to rejoice in your pro&s;perity, though that pro&s;perity has torn from my agonized heart every earthly good: but to proceed&mdash;The day before I called on you and be&s;poke the linen for my &s;i&s;ter Elea|nor, I had received a note from Mrs. Ram|&s;ay informing me that a particular relation was come to town, and as they were unac|quainted with my connection with Mr. Mil|lar, &amp;c. and &s;till regarded me as the wife of her &s;on, &s;he wi&s;hed me to come to town
<PB N="86" REF="029439_0416_0FE117CDF0EAD7A8">
and make them a vi&s;it, taking the elde&s;t child with me. On the morning preceding the day on which this vi&s;it was to be paid, Elea|nor let my watch fall, and without acquaint|ing me with the circum&s;tance &s;ent it to have the damage repaired. You know what followed. I went to town; but, alas! on my arrival at my mother's, who &s;hould I meet but my unworthy hu&s;band. I now too late di&s;covered that my &s;i&s;ter had been in the plot to betray me. He in&s;tantly claimed me, as his lawful wife, and in&s;i&s;ted on my accompanying him abroad, from whence, he &s;aid, he had only returned to fetch me; as he had through the intere&s;t of his friend, obtained a very re&s;pectable place under the French government. It was in vain to remon&s;trate. I was was obliged to comply, and early the next morning we &s;et off for Dover, leaving the children with Mrs. Ram&s;ay. On our arrival in that place, it was too late to think of cro&s;&s;ing the chan|nel that night. We therefore be&s;poke a pa&s;&s;age on board a packet, and as it was to &s;ail by five o'clock the next morning, we retired early to bed. But judge, dear ma|dam, if po&s;&s;ible, my angui&s;h and &s;urprize, when awaking about &s;even o'clock, I found my hu&s;band and &s;i&s;ter had left me, and ta|ken with them my trunks containing all my clothes, jewels, money, &amp;c. leaving me
<PB N="87" REF="029439_0417_0FE117D3D51458D8">
nothing but about &s;ix guineas which I had in my pocket.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e with a heavy heart, and ordered &s;ome breakfa&s;t. While I was taking my &s;olitary meal, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, and inquiring of the maid who attended what company was then in the hou&s;e, I learnt that Mr. Rooky&s;by was there on his way to France, and that the packet he had taken for him&s;elf and &s;er|vants did not &s;ail till the next tide. I then remembered his informing me at his la&s;t vi&s;it, that he &s;hould be obliged to vi&s;it the continent before he could &s;ee me again, and overjoyed to find him in the &s;ame hou&s;e with me, con&s;idered the treatment I had &s;uffered from my hu&s;band as a fortunate cir|cum&s;tance, as it would probably procure me the plea&s;ure of accompanying my adored Rook&s;by abroad. Pardon, madam, the&s;e involuntary expre&s;&s;ions of affection, I will &s;trive to re&s;train my pen: but when the heart has once been &s;trongly attached, it is hard to break it of its u&s;ual effu&s;ions of tenderne&s;s. I bid the &s;ervant &s;hew me to the room where he was, and ru&s;hing into it, overcome with the various emotions, which agitated my bo&s;om, I fainted in his arms. It will be needle&s;s to repeat our conver&s;a|tion. I mu&s;t only remark, that as I had
<PB N="88" REF="029439_0418_0FE117D8410903C0">
never informed him of my unfortunate mar|riage with Ram&s;ay, and, as he had al|ways &s;uppo&s;ed me the wife of Mr. Millar, I did not dare explain to him the real cau&s;e of my abrupt appearance at Dover. He at|tributed it &s;olely to my affection to him&s;elf, and I ble&s;t the chance which had led me to him.</P>
<P>On our return from the continent, I made many enquiries concerning my dear Mi&s;s Howard, for whom I had &s;uffered many an anxious hour; but could not by any means learn where you had taken refuge after the inhuman treatment you had experien|ced at Ken&s;ington. I make no doubt, ma|dam, but you are acquainted with every circum&s;tance, preceding the time in which I had hoped to be united to Mr. Rook&s;by. I had previou&s;ly wrote to Mrs. Ram&s;ay, re|que&s;ting, &s;he would u&s;e her intere&s;t with her &s;on to relinqui&s;h all claim to me as his wife, and indeed, I had been informed I could refute that claim by pleading infancy at the time of my imprudent elopement. To the&s;e letters I received the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory an|&s;wers, &s;igned by both Ram&s;ay and his mo|ther, declaring they were heartily weary of the connection and would gladly renounce it, on condition of my paying a &s;tipulated &s;um of money, to which I readily agreed, and began
<PB N="89" REF="029439_0419_0FE117DD8532CF80">
to look forward with hope to days of future happine&s;s, and let me add innocence, for I felt my heart &s;o firmly attached to the generous Rook&s;by, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for me ever to injure him even in thought. But, ah! my dear madam, how &s;oon were the&s;e bright pro&s;pects overclouded, how quickly was this charming hope &s;natched from me, and, my bo&s;om left a chearle&s;s and de&s;olate chaos, which peace or joy can never more enliven. When I endeavour to retrace this mo&s;t heart rending period of my life: &s;uch agonizing feelings overpower me, that my tears flow in &s;calding torrents down my cheeks; and &s;ighs of acute angui&s;h rend my bo&s;om. I cannot at pre&s;ent proceed in my recital.&mdash;Oh! hea|vens, that one who knows &s;o well the ju&s;t value of virtue, &s;hould be irre&s;i&s;tibly im|pelled to actions from which her &s;oul &s;hrinks with horror. The innocent may pity, but they cannot have the remote&s;t idea of my &s;ufferings.</P>

<P>My heart is more at ea&s;e, tears are a &s;weet relief to the unfortunate, and when I remem|bered the words of con&s;olation which I had
<PB N="90" REF="029439_0420_0FE117E0659692E8">
li&s;tened to from the lips of angelic purity, when the benevolent Mrs. Rook&s;by cheared me with her pre&s;ence, a &s;oothing reflection, &s;omething like hope, pervaded my bo&s;om, and though tears &s;till continued to fall, they fell without pain. I will now proceed in my narrative.</P>
<P>On the evening preceding the day on which I flattered my&s;elf with becoming the happie&s;t of my &s;ex, I expected Mrs. Ram&s;ay to receive the money which I had promi&s;ed to pay her, and therefore, de&s;ired the &s;ervants to deny me, even to the cho&s;en ma&s;ter of my affections. Unfortunate hour, of what &s;cenes of mi&s;ery wert thou the harbinger, but I will not complain, I acknowledge I de&s;erved it all, for had I not deceived the be&s;t the worhie&s;t of mankind, by daring to accept his honour|able offers, when I knew my&s;elf already &s;acrificed (I will not &s;ay united) to a villain. But what will not a woman do, who loves, who doats to madne&s;s and fears to be &s;epara|ted forever from the object of her adoration, what errors will not the heart involuntarily commit when under the influence of hood|winked pa&s;&s;ion?&mdash;</P>
<P>It was about nine o'clock as I was &s;itting in the nur&s;ery, with my two dear boys, that a &s;ervant informed me the per&s;on whom I
<PB N="91" REF="029439_0421_0FE117E5EBFDF680">
expected was below, I ki&s;&s;ed my &s;weet cherubs bade them good night and repaired to the parlour, which I had appointed to receive Mrs. Ram&s;ay in; but now great was my a&s;toni&s;hment on entering the room to &s;ee my inexorable tormenter and his &s;i&s;ter Eleanor, with their mother. I gave a &s;hriek and &s;unk trembling on the neare&s;t chair. Ram&s;ay approached me with feigned tenderne&s;s&mdash;"why the&s;e alarms, my dear Clara," &s;aid he "why &s;hould you &s;tart thus to behold the man who adores you, and who though you have cruelly de&s;erted and injured, is ready again to receive you to his arms, and willing to forget all that is pa&s;t."&mdash;"would to hea|ven" &s;aid I, "that every pa&s;t action of my life could be buried in eternal oblivion, particu|larly that to which I was artfully led by you and your in&s;inuating &s;i&s;ter, of giving you my hand, when a moment's reflection would have convinced me you had no &s;hare in my heart."&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is well, madam," &s;aid he, "you have made a frank confe&s;&s;ion but know it is amply in my power to revenge the repeated in&s;ults and injuries I have received from you.&mdash;You flatter your&s;elf it is in your power to annul a marriage contracted in your minority, but it is not; and unle&s;s you con&s;ent to make me ma&s;ter of all the money and jewels at pre&s;ent
<PB N="92" REF="029439_0422_0FE117E9E45B1930">
in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and leaving this hou&s;e ac|company me wherever I choo&s;e to go, I will to-morrow follow you to the Church and in the face of the whole congregation expo&s;e your infamous conduct, and claim my prior right not only to your per&s;on, but to all the wealth your infatuated lover has heap|ed upon you."&mdash;What were my &s;ufferings at this horrid moment. Turn either way, infamy &s;tared me in the face. I was unable to determine what plan to pur&s;ue. To re|main in London was impo&s;&s;ible, after what had pa&s;t as I &s;hould undoubtedly have been the je&s;t even of my own &s;ervants. At length I concluded, whatever might be my fate, the generous Rook&s;by &s;hould not be involved in the &s;hame that would con&s;equently en&s;ue on a public expo&s;ure of my guilt, I therefore told Ram&s;ay I was ready to accompany him wherever he plea&s;ed; but as to the pre&s;ents I had received from Mr. Rook&s;by, I did not conceive I had any right to take them with me.&mdash;</P>
<P>This was not what the wretch wanted. Horrible menaces and threats were u&s;ed to prevail on me to give him my ca&s;h and jewels, I was intirely in the power of the&s;e three wretches, nor did I dare even to call for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my &s;ervants, as they all declared my life &s;hould pay the forfeit of &s;uch an
<PB N="93" REF="029439_0423_0FE117EF0F3F9850">
attempt: and when they had gained their point, and I attempted to go up &s;tairs to fetch the jewels, both Mrs. Ram&s;ay and Eleanor accompanied me. On returning to the par|lour, they de&s;ired me to &s;end for a Hackney Coach.&mdash;Then it was, dear madam that my innocent infants darted acro&s;s my memory. "I mu&s;t have my children," &s;aid I.&mdash;"In|deed, &s;aid the unfeeling Ram&s;ay, but you will not. The brats are none of mine; leave them then to him who has a right to main|tain them."</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe my angui&s;h at this cruel &s;peech is impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;You, madam, are a mother, and it is only a mother can conceive my &s;uf|ferings. I knelt, I bathed his feet with tears, and embraced his knees, but in vain. Too much under the dominion of fear to exert my&s;elf to in&s;i&s;t on their being taken with me, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be led more dead than alive to the coach; and that very night we all &s;er out for Cornwall. What arts they made u&s;e of to deceive my &s;ervant, I know not; but before our departure from Lon|don my trunks were brought to Mrs. Ram|&s;ay's, and one &s;mall one containing every nece&s;&s;ary for travelling was opened that I might dre&s;s my&s;elf in a proper manner for &s;o long a journey. I never could learn how they had contrived this, but am rather led
<PB N="94" REF="029439_0424_0FE117F1E7AFDDC8">
to imagine they had bribed my own woman to their intere&s;t.&mdash;During my comfortle&s;s journey, all my thoughts were occupied by my beloved children, who were left entirely to the humanity of a man, whom I had de|ceived and injured in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner, and who might avenge the mother's crimes by de&s;erting her offspring. I was &s;en&s;ible Rook&s;by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a benevolent heart, but when I remembered the provocations I had given him&mdash;I trembled for the fate of my poor infants, who&s;e only birth-rights were poverty, &s;hame, and the contempt of the world. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any one, who has not been in the &s;ame &s;ituation to judge of my di&s;tre&s;s. The anxiety of my mind affected my health, and before we arrived at our journey's end I was in a high fever. We &s;topped at a village near Salta&s;h, where my di&s;order increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree that it was dangerous to think of removing me. A delirium en&s;ued and I raved (as I have been &s;ince informed) ince&s;&s;antly for Rook&s;by and my children. At length, youth and a good con&s;titution combated the &s;trength of my di&s;order; and after a profound &s;leep of ma|ny hours, I awoke to perfect rea&s;on; but Gracious Heaven! what were my feelings, to learn when I enquired for Ram&s;ay and Eleanor, that they were gone, and with them all my property. The clergyman of the pa|ri&s;h

At the word brother I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment: but my curio&s;ity and impatience to read the letter would not then permit an explanation. This was the letter</P>

<P>In your attempts to dupe others you have been effectually duped your&s;elf. Vain, fool|i&s;h woman, who thought your boa&s;ted beauty would in&s;ure you admirers in all who beheld you. Ram&s;ay is not your hu&s;band. He was mine long before he &s;aw you. From the fir&s;t moment he beheld you, I &s;aw you had &s;upplanted me in his affections, and therefore determined on revenge.

You have no right to the name of Ram|&s;ay, nor indeed, to any but that of More|ton, which you have &s;hamefully di&s;graced.

I enclo&s;e you ten pounds, if you live it will be of &s;ome &s;ervice to you, if not, whoever opens this may make u&s;e of it for pa&s;t expences.

<P>Before I had fini&s;hed this inhuman letter, I fell into &s;trong convul&s;ions, which occa|&s;ioned a relap&s;e of my di&s;order, and I was again reduced to in&s;anity.</P>
<P>The humane clergyman had me removed to his own hou&s;e, and by the kind atten|tions of him&s;elf and a daughter, I was in time re&s;tored to health and a keen &s;en&s;e of my deplorable &s;ituation.</P>

or expo&s;ed to the har&s;h u&s;age experienced by children left to the pari&s;h, were con|&s;tantly before my eyes, and I re&s;olved at all events to return to London and learn their fate. Ill as my benevolent ho&s;t could afford it, he lent me three guineas to help me on my journey, and gave me a letter to a poor woman, a late pari&s;hioner of his, who was married and &s;ettled in London, re|que&s;ting her to render me every &s;ervice in her power. With this &s;lender &s;um, I &s;at forward and after a weari&s;ome journey &s;ome|times riding, &s;ometimes walking, I arrived &s;ate in town, and took up my abode with the per&s;on ju&s;t mentioned. From the en|quires I made (for I had the temerity to venture to Mr. Rook&s;by's hou&s;e) I learnt his happy marriage with the amiable Mi&s;s Howard, and inwardly rejoiced to think that in &s;uch a union, his future happine&s;s mu&s;t be &s;ecure. I al&s;o learnt, that my chil|dren were in Devon&s;hire. The maternal heart will yearn to pour forth its affection. I had determined to walk to the environs of Oak-hall and endeavour to gain a &s;ight of my beloved little ones, when a mo&s;t un|toward accident prevented my putting my de&s;igns in execution. This was my kind landlady falling ill, and as &s;he kept a &s;hop, her hu&s;band earne&s;tly entreated me to re|main with them till her recovery; to which
<PB N="98" REF="029439_0428_0FE1180559D56B28">
as I was under many obligations to them, I could not but a&s;&s;ent. Her illne&s;s was pain|ful and lingering, and in the end terminated her life. Soon after her decea&s;e, I propo|&s;ed removing from the hou&s;e, when the very man, who had &s;o earne&s;tly entreated my &s;tay, now demanded payment for my board and lodging. I had neither money nor friends. What could I do? I thought once of applying to Mr. Rook&s;by; but the fear of giving you pain prevented me. I &s;ub|mitted to my hard fate in &s;ilence and was conveyed to pri&s;on. Three months did I linger in this wretched place, huddled among the mo&s;t abject and mi&s;erable of the human race; and barely exi&s;ting on the &s;canty pittance allowed me, and the charity of the benevolent. At length, I was one day re|cognized by a trade&s;man, with whom I had dealt in my days of affluence. He com|mi&s;erated my condition, generou&s;ly paid the &s;um for which I had been confined, and gave me two guineas in my pocket. No &s;ooner was I at liberty, than I re&s;umed my wi&s;h of going to my children. I &s;et forward and almo&s;t begged my way to this place; but alas! when here, what could I do for &s;upport, what door would open to receive a poor wretch like me? I wandered every day round the environs of the hall, and once had the extatic plea&s;ure of catching a
<PB N="99" REF="029439_0429_0FE1180A71D28058">
glance of my children: but I dared not &s;peak to them, though I longed to fold them to my maternal heart. My little &s;tock of money was &s;oon exhau&s;ted, though I lived almo&s;t upon bread and water, and at night, re&s;ted my weary limbs on the damp ground. But con&s;cience told me it was all right, and only a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for my errors; &s;o I bore it without complaint, and watered my cold pillow with tears of un|feigned repentance. One afternoon, as I was wandering in the adjacent fields, over|come by hunger and di&s;tre&s;s, I &s;at down be&s;ide a brook that ran along the wood&s;ide and after reflecting a few moments on the horrors of my &s;ituation, I conceived the im|pious idea of putting a period to my exi&s;t|ence. I aro&s;e from my &s;eat to put my de|&s;ign in execution, when hearing a ru&s;tling on the other &s;ide the hedge, I &s;tarted; and in a moment &s;aw Mr. Rook&s;by come acro&s;s a &s;tile into the field where I was. I gave a faint &s;cream and &s;unk to the ground oppre&s;|&s;ed by unde&s;cribable emotions. Urged by humanity, he approached and rai&s;ed me from the earth. I opened my eyes; but dared not look at him.</P>
<P>"Poor &s;oul," &s;aid he, in the accent of benevolence, "you &s;eem ill. Where &s;hall I lead you, or what can I do to &s;erve you."
<PB N="100" REF="029439_0430_0FE1187BB68E04C8">
"Leave me," I replied, with a look and voice of de&s;traction&mdash;"Leave me Rook&s;by to the fate I merit."&mdash;"Gracious heaven!" &s;aid he, "is it po&s;&s;ible, or do my &s;en&s;es de|ceive me?"&mdash;"Oh!" &s;aid I, cla&s;ping my hands, "pity the wretched Clara, and leave her to die in peace."</P>
<P>"Clara," cried he, &s;lackening the arm that had &s;upported me, "poor infatuated wo|man, how came you thus reduced?"&mdash;</P>
<P>I need not repeat what an&s;wer I made&mdash;&s;uffice it to &s;ay, I &s;aw the tear of compa&s;&s;ion &s;parkle in his eye, and heard him declare, I &s;hould be permitted to &s;ee my children.&mdash;He gave me relief with a liberal hand, and at parting, de&s;ired I would let him know where to find me, that I might not be again reduced to &s;uch mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Thus, madam, have I retraced a life of complicated guilt and &s;orrow.

am never comfortable when he is in the fa|mily, though it is only for a vi&s;it of a few hours. How I &s;hall &s;upport his company for &s;ix weeks or two months, I cannot tell. It is a long time &s;ince I have mentioned my &s;weet Clementina; believe me, were I to give inclination the reins; I &s;hould fill a whole &s;heet with accounts of the dear little cherub's daily improvement. But, though the theme would be delightful for a fond mother to ex|patiate upon, I am &s;en&s;ible it would be but in&s;ipid, when offered to the peru&s;al of one who though intere&s;ted in all my concerns, never felt a mother's tenderne&s;s, anxiety and &s;olicitude.</P>

<P>You will be &s;urprized, my dear Celia, when I tell you, I am become the lady Boun|tiful of all our poor tenants and their families. I walk round every morning or evening; that the weather permits, and admini&s;ter to the de&s;ea&s;es of both body and mind. In the fir&s;t I am a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a worthy apothecary, who having a large &s;hare of merit, Fortune thought he had &s;ufficient, and was therefore extremely &s;paring of her favours; &s;o that the poor man with a great deal of knowledge in his head, much benevolence in his heart, and a large family in his hou&s;e, had but very

little money in his pur&s;e. I heard of him by accident, and not being extremely well, &s;ent for him, though his unpowdered wig and thread-bare coat would not have been a recommendation, had I con&s;ulted his appear|ance only; but I chatted with him half an hour &s;everal mornings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and found his company more efficacious than his me|dicines; for I was always better after his vi&s;its, the rea&s;on of which was, I thought the doctor him&s;elf &s;eemed happier. So one after|noon, Amelia and I took a &s;troll acro&s;s the park, and &s;pent an hour or two with his wife and her &s;ix chubby, ro&s;y cheeked chil|dren, and at parting, contrived it &s;o that at the next vi&s;it the doctor came neither in an unpowdered wig or thread-bare coat; &s;ince which time he has con&s;tantly been our e&s;corte in our vi&s;its to the &s;ick. I find money and he finds phy&s;ic, and I do a&s;&s;ure you we are both very well plea&s;ed with our &s;everal de|partments. Be&s;ides you cannot think how the doctor is ri&s;ing in reputation, &s;ince his appearance is &s;o mended. He is now often &s;een coming out of the doors of the wealthy, which I hope pre&s;ages he will one day become wealthy him&s;elf.</P>

<P>I am extremely flurried and vexed, indeed I think my evil genius prevailed, when Rook&s;by fir&s;t formed an acquaintance with Belger. The man is an unprincipled liber|tine, and Amelia was greatly mi&s;taken, when &s;he imagined any tie however &s;acred, would be re&s;triction upon his licentious pa&s;|&s;ion.&mdash;</P>
<P>Rook&s;by had rode out la&s;t evening, Amelia was reading to Mrs. Rook&s;by, and I imagin|ing Belger was with my hu&s;band, took a book in my hand and &s;trolled out to indulge a contemplative mood, which at that time prevailed over my mind. I rambled far|ther than I at fir&s;t intended, and before I was aware of it, the &s;hades of night came on.&mdash;The evening was remarkably fine, the moon aro&s;e veiled in a fleecy cloud, which &s;erved only to increa&s;e the glory it could not hide; a gentle zephyr whi&s;pered through the trees, and I felt a &s;en&s;ation of gratitude, wonder and delight pervade my &s;oul; whil&s;t admiring, I beheld the beauty of the &s;urrounding &s;cene, at the top of a walk at no great di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, but on a little eminence, there is a &s;ummer|hou&s;e greatly admired by all the family for
<PB N="107" REF="029439_0437_0FE1182A2ADF43F8">
the charming view it commands of an exten|&s;ive well cultivated country. In this place I had been working in the morning, and in pa&s;&s;ing it, recollected I had left my work|bag there, in which was &s;omething I wanted. I therefore &s;tepped in with a de&s;ign of bring|ing it away. The moon &s;hone through the windows full upon an organ which was pla|ced there for me to entertain my&s;elf with, and as I am fond of &s;olemn mu&s;ic, the &s;till|ne&s;s of the evening and the &s;erenity of every &s;urrounding object in&s;pired me with a wi&s;h to touch the in&s;trument.

<P>I had &s;ung it over once, and was ju&s;t re|peating the la&s;t &s;tanza with all the real fer|vour which at that moment warmed my &s;oul, when hearing a foot&s;tep, I turned round and &s;aw Mr. Belger enter the &s;ummer hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"So you are returned," &s;aid I, ri&s;ing from my &s;eat; "but pray where is Rook&s;by."</P>
<P>"I have not been with him," replied Belger, "nor do I think he is returned. I have been enjoying a far greater plea&s;ure, than any he can meet with abroad. I have been li&s;tening to your charming voice, which with &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tic fervour, has been pour|ing forth the grateful emotions of your &s;oul."</P>
<P>"I have been here &s;ome time," &s;aid I carele&s;sly, "and I believe it is getting late.

<P>"You mu&s;t not go, deare&s;t, lovelie&s;t of women, I cannot lo&s;e this only opportunity which I have had of &s;peaking to you without ob&s;ervation. Hear me, pity me! From the fir&s;t moment, that I beheld you, my heart has known neither joy nor peace. In every place, in every hour, &s;leeping or waking, your image &s;till pur&s;ues me. I love, I doat to madne&s;s and yet have only the hope of exciting your compa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"My contempt &s;ir, you certainly excite, by this unparalled effrontery. I thought Mr. Belger had received my an&s;wer on this &s;ub|ject &s;ome years &s;ince, and am &s;urprized how|ever, he then dared to in&s;ult an unprotected girl, that he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e he might with impunity now repeat tho&s;e in&s;ults to the wife of his friend."</P>
<P>He li&s;tened not to what I was &s;aying, but placing him&s;elf between me and the door, forcibly &s;eized my hands, and was proceed|ing to the mo&s;t romantic profe&s;&s;ions of plato|nic love, when I &s;aw Mr. Rook&s;by coming up the walk. Agitated and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed beyond mea&s;ure, I cried "cruel, per&s;ecuting Belger,
<PB N="110" REF="029439_0440_0FE1183986F39250">
you have exepo&s;ed me to the &s;u&s;picions of my hu&s;band, who mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a guilty a&s;&s;ignation has been the cau&s;e of our being alone here at this late hour." I had no time to &s;ay more. Mr. Rook&s;by entered. "why, my dear Meriel" &s;aid he, "do you &s;tay out thus late expo&s;ing your&s;elf to the dews of the evening," then perceiving Belger, he added, "but you have company with you and, perhaps, I intrude on an agreeable <HI>tete-a-tete."</HI> I endeavoured to compo&s;e my agitated &s;pirits, and an&s;wer him in a &s;tyle of raillery; but it was impo&s;&s;ible. I di&s;covered by the manner in which he &s;poke, that the unhappy jealou&s;y of his temper was awaken|ed, and that it would not be an ea&s;y matter to convince him, his &s;u&s;picions were without foundation, I trembled, as I took hold of his arm; and we proceeded in &s;ilence to the hou&s;e. When we entered, my mother ten|derly expre&s;&s;ed her anxiety and fears of my having taken cold, Amelia too gently chid me for playing truant as &s;he called it. I do not know how I looked, but I am &s;ure I felt very di&s;agreeably. Indeed, the raillery of Amelia, the cold re&s;erve of Rook&s;by, and the humi|liating glances of Belger &s;o powerfully affect|ed my feelings; that I pleaded indi&s;po&s;ition and retired to my apartment, where I have given vent to my tears, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my heart, by relating the cau&s;e of my

All the&s;e circum&s;tances mu&s;t tend to make me appear guilty of impropri|ety, if not imprudence. Again and again I repeat it. Belger &s;eems doomed to be the bane of my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Amelia has ju&s;t been with me. I informed her of the cau&s;e I had for unea&s;ine&s;s. She blamed me for retiring &s;o early, &s;aying it gave me an appearance of con&s;cious guilt, though &s;he was fully &s;en&s;ible that every thought of my heart was purity it&s;elf; &s;he bade me a&s;&s;ume an air of cheerfulne&s;s, as &s;he was afraid that the timid embarra&s;&s;ment that mode&s;ty and real innocence ever di&s;covers, when glanced on by the eye of &s;u&s;picion, would only tend to encrea&s;e the doubts Rook&s;by already harboured. But I hear him coming. I mu&s;t quit my pen and retire to bed, though greatly I fear, not to re&s;t.</P>

<P>When Rook&s;by entered the apartment, a mixture of &s;orrow, anger and di&s;tre&s;s &s;at on his countenance.&mdash;"I thought, madam," &s;aid he, "you were indi&s;po&s;ed, as you retired &s;o early; but I &s;ee you are not in bed yet; but agreeable meditation is certainly more plea&s;ing, than the company of tho&s;e we di&s;|like. Pray do not let me di&s;turb your reve|rie."&mdash;"You &s;peak in riddles, Mr. Rook&s;by. Who&s;e company did you &s;uppo&s;e I fled from, when I left the parlour. Solitude, indeed, was more agreeable than to be in company, and witne&s;s the frown of di&s;plea&s;ure that &s;at on your countenance. It was not the head|ach impelled me to retire; it was a pain more acute."&mdash;I could not proceed, but laying my hand on my bo&s;om, the involun|tary tear choaked my utterance.</P>
<P>"My beloved Meriel, "&s;aid he, &s;itting down by me, and &s;peaking in a &s;oftened accent, "do not weep. Tho&s;e precious tears would melt a heart of adamant: think then, how much they mu&s;t di&s;tre&s;s one who glows with unutterable tenderne&s;s toward you."</P>
<P>"Ah Rook&s;by, why, if you really ex|perience &s;uch tender emotions in my favour,

why have you wounded my heart, by utter|ing &s;uch unkind, I may &s;ay, cruel &s;u&s;picions."</P>
<P>"Meriel", &s;aid he, looking at me intent|ly, "did you not confe&s;s you knew Belger &s;ome time &s;ince at Ken&s;ington."</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, I did."</P>
<P>"And during the time of your acquaint|ance there, did he never expre&s;s his admi|ration&mdash;his e&s;teem&mdash;his love to you."</P>
<P>"How can you a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion? He was at that time"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Married, you would &s;ay," cried he, in|terrupting me, "but I know he was not, and I remember hearing him once &s;peak of a beautiful creature, he knew at that place, who had more power over his heart than all the re&s;t of the &s;ex put together."</P>
<P>"And therefore, it follows," &s;aid I, "that I mu&s;t be the per&s;on he meant (attempting a &s;mile.) My dear Rook&s;by, if you have &s;uch an opinion of your Meriel's attractions, &s;he has a far more humble one of her&s;elf."</P>

Indeed, my friend, I began to wi&s;h I had not concealed from Mr. Rook&s;by any thing, that pa&s;&s;ed during my re&s;idence at Ken&s;ing|ton. If I had informed him of Belger's un|principled behaviour to me at that place he might not have renewed his intimacy, but I always have an objection to relating any tale whereof I am my&s;elf the heroine, and in this point I avoided it, fearing to incur the imputation of vanity, and in &s;o doing, I have incurred that of guilt.&mdash;To mention the&s;e circum&s;tances now would be impo&s;&s;ible, as it would only tend to confirm Rook&s;by's &s;u&s;picions, perhaps engage him in a quarrel with Belger and by making it a public affair, ca&s;t a blemi&s;h on my reputation, which no future conduct will ever wipe off. But I think through the whole cour&s;e of my life I have been particularly unfortunate in having my mo&s;t innocent actions mi&s;con&s;trued, and though my own bo&s;om conceals not a wi&s;h which does not tend to the univer&s;al happine&s;s of mankind in general. I have never want|ed enemies, who are ever ready to catch at the errors, to which frail mortality is liable; and magnify them into crimes.&mdash;I have however a &s;weet con&s;olation Celia. My heart is con&s;cious of its own integrity and relies on that Power, who knows its innocence to &s;up|port it through every trial, which in His wi&s;|dom He may &s;ee proper to lay upon it. This
<PB N="116" REF="029439_0446_0FE118561A2B2C48">
is a con&s;olation of which no afflicton, how|ever &s;evere, can rob me.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rook&s;by is I fear, in a declining &s;tate of health. Age and its attendant in|firmities bend her frame to the earth; but her mind is &s;till in full vigour. She is the &s;ame pious, re&s;igned chearful chri&s;tian, as ever: and her company is equally &s;ought by the young as well as by tho&s;e more nearly of her own years. A journey to the &s;outh of France is judged nece&s;&s;ary for her the en&s;uing winter. Mr. Rook&s;by does not wi&s;h to leave England; &s;o I have not hinted my de&s;ire of accompanying her. Indeed, my pre&s;ent &s;ituation would render travelling dan|gerous, Amelia goes with her, and I mean to invite Su&s;an Mo&s;&s;op to &s;pend the winter with me in town, not that I expect to reap much plea&s;ure from her &s;ociety; but I think a re&s;idence in my family may be of &s;ervice to her; and &s;hould any proper match offer, the want of a fortune &s;hall not be an ob&s;tacle, Adieu my friend, your's ever.</P>

Yes, my beloved friend, the &s;weet enchant|ing &s;cenes of happine&s;s now fade upon my &s;ight, and like the delu&s;ive vi&s;ion of a di&s;or|dered imagination, &s;erves only to make the &s;urrounding de&s;olate pro&s;pect, the more dark and gloomy.</P>
<P>From the time of my la&s;t letter, Mrs. Rook&s;by's health has evidently become wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day; &s;o that we were obliged to ha&s;ten her departure for the con|tinent, as the phy&s;icians feared the cold au|tumnal bla&s;ts would be too much for her enervated frame to bear. We were bu&s;y in preparing for her departure, when one even|ing ju&s;t as the &s;un was &s;et, a little girl came and informed me a poor tenant of our's was taken &s;uddenly ill, and wi&s;hed very much to &s;ee me.&mdash;As Amelia was bu&s;y in her own apartment, I would not in|terrupt her to reque&s;t her company; but taking &s;ome cordials with me and bidding Thomas follow, I took hold of the little girl and bid her lead me to the cottage. When I arrived the poor woman told me &s;he had been &s;eized with a &s;udden fit, and imagining her&s;elf dying&mdash;&s;he had &s;ent for me to re|commend her children to my care; but as &s;he now found her&s;elf much better, &s;he hum|bly hoped I would pardon the trouble &s;he had given me. As I had walked very quick, I

found my&s;elf &s;omewhat fatigued and &s;at down for a few moments to re&s;t. Whil&s;t I &s;at, I bu&s;ied my&s;elf in making enquiries concerning the poor woman's family, and learnt that &s;he had &s;even children and a very bad hu&s;band.&mdash;"I have been in a deal of trouble, madam," &s;aid &s;he, "Robin has been very idle this &s;ummer and had gotten him&s;elf in debt; but we were relieved from our nece&s;&s;ities by a gentleman, who is I be|lieve, at the Hall; for the children &s;ay they have &s;een him there. Oh! madam, he has been the pre&s;erver of me and mine, and I am bound to pray for his pro&s;perity." She was eagerly proceeding, when ca&s;ting my eye toward the window, I &s;aw Belger open the wicket, which &s;erved for a gate, and come in.&mdash;"Here is your benefactor coming good woman" &s;aid I, and &s;lipping two gui|neas into her hand, went toward the door, but was not quick enough to e&s;cape, before Belger entered.&mdash;"Ble&s;s me my fair ho&s;t|e&s;s," &s;aid he, in an accent of &s;urpri&s;e; "who could have thought of &s;eeing you here; not that it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee Mrs. Rook&s;by in the cottage of poverty &s;weetly alleviating its attendant evils, but the latene&s;s of the hour and to &s;ee her without Mi&s;s Sidney."</P>

I then darted at him a look expre&s;&s;ive of my hone&s;t indignation, and endeavoured to quit the hou&s;e: but he threw him&s;elf on his knees before me, and forcibly taking my hand earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to be heard for only one moment. From the in&s;tant Belger fir&s;t entered, the woman had from a motive of re&s;pect left the room, and my &s;ervant was without &s;ide the gate, waiting for my coming out.</P>
<P>I was he&s;itating for an an&s;wer, by which I might hope to make him relinqui&s;h his de|&s;ign; when I heard my hu&s;band's voice en|quiring of the &s;ervant, "whom he was waiting for?"</P>
<P>"My mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ir," replied the man.</P>
<P>"Your mi&s;tre&s;s is here then&mdash;and who is with her?"</P>
<P>"Mr. Belger went in a few moments &s;ince."</P>
<P>"Damnation!" exclaimed he, and pu&s;h|ing by the man with violence in&s;tantly ru&s;hed into the hou&s;e. How I looked, or what I &s;aid, I cannot pretend to determine, but of this I am certain my feelings were unde|&s;cribable.</P>

"It is well, madam," &s;aid he, "I have at length di&s;covered the true cau&s;e of your frequent rambles toward this cottage, and by heavens."&mdash;Rage choaked him, I &s;ummoned all my re&s;olution and endeavoured to calm his agitated &s;pirits.</P>
<P>"Frequent rambles, Mr. Rook&s;by, I do not under&s;tand you; I never was at this cot|tage before, nor &s;hould have come now had I not been &s;ent for."</P>
<P>"I know you were &s;ent for. That is the very thing that drives me to madne&s;s. Oh!

But, this is no time for argument; tell me, thou vile reptile, who under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip ha&s;t di&s;honoured me, what reparation can you make for the peace you have de&s;troyed, for the purity you have &s;ullied?&mdash;</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 29<HI>th,</HI> 1783.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been extremely ill &s;ince I la&s;t ad|dre&s;&s;ed my dear Celia, occa&s;ioned by the violent agitation my &s;pirits had undergone. The morning after the di&s;agreeable rencoun|ter mentioned in my la&s;t, I found my&s;elf much indi&s;po&s;ed; but as it was the day intended for Mrs. Rook&s;by's departure, I aro&s;e at the u&s;ual time and endeavoured to appear as chearful as po&s;&s;ible, that the dear old lady might not perceive the di&s;tre&s;s of my mind. Rook&s;by &s;eemed in&s;pired with the &s;ame wi&s;h and though he had not &s;poken to me during the whole night, yet at breakfa&s;t a&s;&s;umed his u&s;ual tenderne&s;s of manner. It was with infinite plea&s;ure I learnt that Belger had &s;et out for town long before any of the family were &s;tirring, leaving only a card to my mother pleading urgent bu&s;ine&s;s as his excu&s;e for &s;o precipitate a departure, and wi&s;hing her intended journey might have the de&s;ired
<PB N="128" REF="029439_0458_0FE1188FE26C4180">
effect and re&s;tore her to perfect health. At twelve o'clock the chariot drew up to the door&mdash;I felt my &s;pirits &s;ink. I looked fir&s;t at my dear Amelia, then at my mother, and taking a hand from each, pre&s;&s;ed them to my heart and bur&s;t into tears. It was in vain any longer to hide my &s;orrows&mdash;I &s;aw the&s;e invaluable friends departing from me at the very moment when I mo&s;t wanted their &s;oothing attentions. I looked on my gene|rous benefactre&s;s, perhaps, for the la&s;t time. Her wan cheek and emaciated frame, too plainly announced her approaching di&s;&s;olu|tion.</P>
<P>I threw my arms round her&mdash;I endea|voured to articulate an adieu&mdash;but words were denied me.&mdash;"God ble&s;s you my dear child," &s;aid &s;he. "Clement, be tender of her&mdash;comfort her&mdash;&s;tudy her felicity&mdash;and may Heaven &s;hower its choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings on you both." She then took up my little Clementina, and letting fall a tear as &s;he pre&s;&s;ed the &s;miling Cherub to her bo&s;om, cried emphatically, "Oh thou &s;weet angel! Heaven grant that you may live to be an honour to your father and a ble&s;&s;ing to your mother&mdash;maye&s;t thou be endowed with all her virtues without any of his faults." She then once more embraced me and went to the carriage. Amelia &s;tayed behind a mo|ment
<PB N="129" REF="029439_0459_0FE118948385FE28">
to comfort and re-a&s;&s;ure me. She bid me keep up my &s;pirits and tru&s;t in that Pow|er for &s;upport, who never yet for&s;ook the innocent.</P>
<P>Rook&s;by accompanied them &s;ome miles on hor&s;e back. I followed the chariot with my eyes as long as I could, and then retir|ing to my chamber, threw my&s;elf on the bed, and gave a loo&s;e to unutterable &s;orrow. However the &s;pirit may be afflicted, nature exhau&s;ted by various conflicts will in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ink under the balmy influence of &s;leep.&mdash;This was my ca&s;e: I &s;lept about two hours, but awoke unrefre&s;hed, and in acute pain. My head ached, my tongue was parched, and I had every &s;ymptom of an approaching fever. However I endeavoured to ri&s;e and dre&s;s, to be ready to receive Rook&s;by, as he propo&s;ed returning to dinner: but to this ta&s;k I was unequal. My head was giddy and my limbs trembled. He&s;ter, my woman, was alarmed. She rang for the hou&s;e-maid, who ju&s;t came in time to help to &s;upport me; for in attempting to go from my bed|chamber to the dre&s;&s;ing-room, I had fainted. On recovering, I found much wor&s;e con&s;e|quences were to be apprehended, than I had at fir&s;t imagined. I &s;ent immediately for me|dical a&s;&s;i&s;tance and about four o'clock the next morning, I was delivered of a dead
<PB N="130" REF="029439_0460_0FE11899F69C1658">
child. For &s;ome hours I was totally in&s;en|ble, and for more than a week my life was de&s;paired of. Rook&s;by was frequent in his enquiries after my health; but I could plain|ly perceive, he thought more of the lo&s;s of his &s;on than my evidently dangerous &s;itua|tion. However it plea&s;ed Heaven to re&s;tore me, though by &s;low degrees, and the mo|ment the phy&s;icians pronounced me able to bear the fatigue of travelling, I &s;et off for London, vainly hoping that variety of &s;cenes, company and public amu&s;ements would re|&s;tore in &s;ome mea&s;ure my lo&s;t chearfulne&s;s; at lea&s;t I thought it would bani&s;h tho&s;e cor|roding reflections which gnawed and goaded my poor lacerated heart. Oh! my beloved Celia, Rook&s;by no longer retains the &s;mall|e&s;t degree of affection for me. In company he is polite, but di&s;tant; when by our&s;elves (which is indeed but &s;eldom) he is cold, un|kind, and my Celia will hardly believe it, he once on my gently remon&s;trating on this painful change, &s;truck me, nay cur&s;ed me, and called me by a name, my &s;oul &s;hudders to think on. That he hates and de&s;pi&s;es the woman he once doated on is now become too evident to be doubted; for he has never returned to my apartment &s;ince my illne&s;s, but occupies one in another part of the hou&s;e. Su&s;an Mo&s;&s;op is with me. She is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more tenderne&s;s and goodne&s;s of heart
<PB N="131" REF="029439_0461_0FE1189F0D092498">
than I at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected. She labours ince&s;|antly to amu&s;e me, and though I cannot partake of her chearfulne&s;s, I am grateful for her attention. He&s;ter is married to a man of genteel fortune, but from what I can judge of the character of both, I think they will pa&s;s that kind of in&s;ipid life &s;o well de|&s;cribed by Prior in his epitaph on &s;auntering Jack and idle Joan.</P>
<L>Nor wi&s;hed, nor cared, nor laughed nor cried,</L>
<L>And &s;o they lived, and &s;o they died.</L>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from an airing in Hyde Park, and have been greatly a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee Clara there, whom I left in Devon&s;hire. She was on hor&s;e-back, elegantly mounted and attended by a &s;ervant in livery. A con|fu&s;ed idea ran through my mind, when I fir&s;t &s;aw her, yet &s;urely &s;he can never add ingratitude to infamy, by &s;educing the af|fections of the hu&s;band, when &s;he has been re&s;cued from want and mi&s;ery by the wife, yet, what can have brought her to town, or how is it po&s;&s;ible &s;he can afford to appear in the manner ju&s;t de&s;cribed.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am &s;ati&s;fied Rook&s;by mu&s;t &s;till hold &s;ome intercour&s;e with Clara. We have ju&s;t had a <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> in which he accu&s;ed me of de|ceiving him, of giving him my hand when

my heart was devoted to another; and of having been long acquainted with Belger, with whom it was well known, I had an illicit intercour&s;e. Deare&s;t Celia, imagine the agonizing feelings of my heart on being &s;ubject to &s;uch unju&s;t, &s;uch cruel &s;u&s;picions. It was in vain I attempted to a&s;&s;ert my inno|cence; he was well informed, he &s;aid, of every incident that had pa&s;&s;ed during my re&s;idence at Ken&s;ington; that I had been the intimate acquaintance of women of light characters; that my own conduct in regard to Belger was notoriou&s;ly infamous, and that I was in reality the exact rever&s;e of what I had &s;pe|ciou&s;ly appeared to his mother, or &s;he never would &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly have pre&s;&s;ed our union. Oh! my friend, would to heaven, I had tru&s;t|ed to the dictates of my own judgment, had been guided by the impul&s;e of my heart which &s;trongly urged me to reject this man; but compa&s;&s;ion, gratitude, and the combined wi&s;hes of tho&s;e whom I mo&s;t loved and re|&s;pected, operated &s;o powerfully on my feel|ings, that I was unable to with&s;tand their &s;olicitations; and Heaven be my witne&s;s, I have not in one in&s;tance &s;ince I have been united to Rook&s;by infringed the &s;malle&s;t duty incumbent on the &s;acred character of wife.

chearful, but the effort is vain, and when I contemplate her pale, yet placid countenance, the tears will involuntarily bur&s;t from my eyes. She, this morning, ob|&s;erving my emotions, called me to the bed&s;ide, (from which &s;he is now &s;carcely able to ri&s;e, even while it is making) and ta|king my hand, "my dear Mi&s;s Sidney," &s;aid &s;he, "do not let my approaching di&s;&s;olution give you pain.&mdash;I &s;ee it draw near with no other apprehen&s;ion than what frail mortality mu&s;t feel, when called from a temporal to an eternal &s;tate, into the immediate pre&s;ence of the Creator of the Univer&s;e!&mdash;I have had my &s;pan lengthened out far beyond what I had ever expected.&mdash;I feel no regret at leaving this tran&s;itory life;&mdash;for my only care was centered in the happine&s;s of my &s;on, and him I &s;hall leave happy in the affection of the be&s;t, the worthie&s;t of her &s;ex.

He is not in&s;en&s;ible to the merit of Mi&s;s Sidney, and has reque&s;ted me to plead his cau&s;e. I flatter my&s;elf you will not refu&s;e his &s;uit."&mdash;She pau&s;ed. I was
<PB N="135" REF="029439_0465_0FE118B3A08053E8">
&s;ilent. I had frequently &s;een and admired Captain On&s;low: he is in the Ea&s;t-India &s;ervice; for though a man of fortune, he prefers a life of activity to one of &s;upine in|dolence. An indifferent &s;tate of health, brought him to Aix-la-Chapelle; but being now perfectly recovered, he propo&s;ed rejoin|ing his regiment, which it is expected will be ordered to Bengal the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on. I &s;hould not be thus particular, but know|ing from &s;ome di&s;agreement between Mr. Rook&s;by and the Captain, you were totally ignorant that you had &s;uch a relation, and therefore might wi&s;h &s;ome information. I had without vanity rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the Captain's partiality; nor can I with truth a&s;&s;ert, that my bo&s;om felt that indifference toward him, which it had ever maintained toward the re&s;t of his &s;ex. Yet Mrs. Rook&s;|by taking me at a moment &s;o unprepared, I he&s;itated, and knew not what to an&s;wer. She &s;aw my confu&s;ion and then continued, "I have in my will left you a &s;mall token of my regard, which if you li&s;ten to On&s;low's &s;uit, I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on &s;eeing &s;ettled on your|&s;elf, if it is not painful, my dear Amelia, I could wi&s;h to hear your candid &s;enti|ments on this &s;ubject, and it would give me infinite &s;atisfaction of &s;ee you united to &s;o worthy a man before I breathe my la&s;t; as the welfare of every one dear to my charming

daughter-in-law mu&s;t ever intere&s;t my fonde&s;t &s;olicitude," I thanked the generous woman in terms of heartfelt gratitude, a&s;&s;ured her I was perfectly happy in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, but that if it was my fate to change, I knew of no per&s;on I &s;hould prefer to Captain On|&s;low.

"Oh! my dear madam, &s;aid I," in an agony of grief, "do not talk thus, I hope you will recover."&mdash;</P>

<P>From this great theatre of di&s;&s;ipation and folly does Meriel once more addre&s;s her friend&mdash;but why am I not permitted to &s;ee you? why in the &s;ame kingdom does indi&s;pen&s;ible duties keep me from flying to you, and in your peaceful cloi&s;ter burying my&s;elf at once from the world and all its &s;orrows? Alas I too plainly feel that even there I could not now be at peace: for thither &s;hould I carry corroding thought, the pangs of di&s;appointed love, the remembrance of abu&s;ed confidence, ingratitude and ill requited friend&s;hip.&mdash;Strange &s;cenes have pa&s;&s;ed, my friend, &s;ince I wrote you la&s;t; I have hovered on the brink of eternity, from whence I was only &s;natched to be the victim of future mi&s;ery; but let me pur&s;ue &s;ome method in my narrative and carry you back to the time when the receipt of Amelia's letter hurried us to proceed as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible to Aix to catch

the parting &s;igh and receive the dying ble&s;|&s;ing of my la&s;t dear parent, my more than mother. Every preparation nece&s;&s;ary for our departure was &s;oon made, when the even|ing previous to the day on which we were to &s;et out, Rook&s;by came into my dre&s;&s;ing room, where I was bu&s;y in making &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;ary arrangements with the hou&s;ekeeper, and bidding her quit the room &s;at down be|&s;ide me, and looking with more complacency than he had lately done, when addre&s;&s;ing me, &s;aid, "I have unknown to you Meriel made a little addition to our party to the continent, and flatter my&s;elf it will not be di&s;agreeable."&mdash;I believe I looked &s;urprized when I replied, "had our journey been one of plea&s;ure I could certainly have no objec|tion to any per&s;on, whom he &s;hould think proper to join us, but on &s;o mournful an oc|ca&s;ion I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the pre&s;ence of a &s;tran|ger"&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is not a &s;tranger," &s;aid he (interrupt|ing me eagerly,) "it is poor Clara."</P>
<P>"Clara, &s;ir?" in a tone of angry &s;urprize.</P>
<P>"Yes, my dear," he an&s;wered he&s;itatingly, "She is in a bad &s;tate of health; I met her lately by accident. She cannot well afford &s;o long a journey; and it is a good opportu|nity."</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="029439_0470_0FE118CD767F08D8">
"Rook&s;by &s;aid I," fixing my eyes upon his face: I think you know me well enough to be certain that if Clara is really ill and in want, &s;he has a claim to every tender office of humanity from me as a fellow-creature, but"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Nay, Meriel, no buts: &s;urely (affecting a &s;mile) "you are not jealous?"&mdash;"No, &s;ir, you may re&s;t quite ea&s;y on that head. I can|not think &s;o meanly of you as to &s;uppo&s;e af|ter what had pa&s;&s;ed you would again be the dupe of an artful woman; for however my compa&s;&s;ion may have been awakened toward Clara, I cannot help thinking her a woman capable of the ba&s;e&s;t duplicity."</P>
<P>"She is going to be married to Belger," &s;aid he, endeavoring to hide his evident em|barra&s;&s;ment under the ma&s;k of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"But I hope, &s;ir, he is not to join us!" &s;aid I, reddening with indignation at the re|membrance of pa&s;t injuries, which I could now trace to their right &s;ource.</P>
<P>"No, he will follow Clara to Aix, and if my mother dies, we &s;hall all &s;pend the win|ter in Paris."</P>
<P>The evident compo&s;ure with which he mentioned &s;uch an afflicting circum&s;tance,
<PB N="141" REF="029439_0471_0FE118D0D68C3780">
out me to the &s;oul.&mdash;"You &s;peak of your mother with great indifference," &s;aid I, and the tears gu&s;hed from my eyes.</P>
<P>"Indifference, no, indeed I am extremely &s;orry; but you know, my dear, &s;he is an old woman, and we mu&s;t expect it, and that you know prepares us for the &s;troke, and prevents the &s;hock we &s;hould otherwi&s;e feel. I have been thinking," continued he after a little pau&s;e, "that I &s;hall have the Hall pulled down next &s;ummer and built in a more modern &s;tile."</P>
<P>I turned from him with &s;ilent contempt and re&s;ting my cheek upon my hand gave a loo&s;e to melancholy reflections. Celia I have been deceived in this man. He has no heart, no &s;en&s;ibility; every feeling of his &s;oul is ab&s;orbed in &s;elf. Why, why was my fate united to &s;uch a man. I was rou&s;ed from my rever&s;e by a loud knock at the door.&mdash;"That is Clara," &s;aid he, &s;tarting up. "I de&s;ired &s;he would &s;leep here, that we might be ready to &s;et off together in the morning." I felt a faint chillne&s;s &s;eize me as he &s;poke. I believe my voice faultered as I &s;aid, go down then and receive her; I will ju&s;t take one more look at my dear little girl and join you immediately." When he had left the room I &s;unk motionle&s;s on the &s;opha. "Good heaven," &s;aid I, "and is it come to this. Can
<PB N="142" REF="029439_0472_0FE118D6624CF5C8">
it be po&s;&s;ible, that the man whom I have pro|mi&s;ed to love and honour &s;hould thus forget what is due to me, to his child and to him|&s;elf? But I will not judge too ra&s;hly, conti|nued I, ri&s;ing and drying my eyes. Per|haps they may not be guilty. Jealou&s;y magni|fies every object, and con&s;trues even laudable actions into crimes." I then vi&s;ited the nur&s;e|ry and having pa&s;&s;ed a few minutes in care&s;|&s;ing my little Clementina, I de&s;cended to the drawing room where I found Clara negligent|ly &s;eated on a &s;opha by Rook&s;by, and Su&s;an Mo&s;&s;op playing on the Piano Forte. Clara ro&s;e from her &s;eat, coloured and he&s;itatingly &s;aid &s;omething about intru&s;ion. I confe&s;s I was not le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed my&s;elf; however I paid her the civilities nece&s;&s;ary as being my gue&s;t and we immediately went to &s;upper, &s;oon after which I retired on pretence of mak|ing &s;ome further preparations, and having given orders about an apartment for Clara, I &s;at down and wrote a few lines to Su&s;an re|que&s;ting, as &s;he intended &s;taying in town, till &s;he heared from us the re&s;ult of our voyage and whether we returned or pa&s;t the winter on the continent, that &s;he would be particu|larly attentive to the child, and in ca&s;e of her father's &s;ending for her begged &s;he would accompany her to Paris. This I did by let|ter, being &s;en&s;ible I &s;hould have no time to &s;peak to her in the morning; and I did not
<PB N="143" REF="029439_0473_0FE118DB1498EB30">
think proper to &s;end for her up &s;tairs at that time. Early in the morning our po&s;t coach was at the door, and by &s;ix o'clock Mr. Rook&s;by, Clara, my&s;elf and Le&s;ter my wo|man were &s;eated in it; and we proceeded with all imaginable &s;peed to Dover. Rook&s;by immediately on our arrival &s;ent to &s;peak to the ma&s;ter of a Packet. We found it was impo&s;&s;ible to think of embarking till the next morning, and were informed by the man that a gentleman and lady ju&s;t arrived from town had taken their pa&s;&s;age on board his ve&s;&s;el. While we continued talking, a gen|tle tap at the door interrupted us, and on its being opened who &s;hould enter but Mrs. Kingly. It was a mo&s;t agreeable &s;urprize to me, though I believe not &s;o to Rook&s;by. "Well met my dear cou&s;in," &s;aid &s;he, af|fectionately &s;aluting me, "it is fortunate that we &s;hould both be travelling the &s;ame way. I &s;aw your livery in the yard and im|mediately made my enquiries." Kingly is gone out, &s;o you &s;ee I took the opportunity and eloped to you; but when he returns I am &s;ure he will be as happy as my&s;elf to pay you his re&s;pects." While &s;he was &s;peaking &s;he did not notice who was in the room, and, indeed, Clara &s;at in an ob&s;cure corner by the fire, but as &s;he fini&s;hed the la&s;t &s;entence, turning ha&s;tily round &s;he &s;aw her; but not recognizing her immediately cried, "I fear
<PB N="144" REF="029439_0474_0FE118E0463A2978">
I am guilty of rudene&s;s, you have company."&mdash;"No one particular," &s;aid I. It is only Mrs. Moreton." Clara was now under the nece&s;&s;ity of ri&s;ing; Mrs. Kingly &s;tarted and curt&s;ying formally, while &s;he gave Rook&s;by a mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive look, &s;aid &s;he could not have expected to &s;ee Mrs. Moreton in this party, not knowing we were acquainted. I really felt for Clara; her colour varied from red to pale and from pale to red, till I thought &s;he would have &s;unk. Rook&s;by looked mor|tified, and I only &s;lightly &s;aid, that Mrs. More|ton having but indifferent health wi&s;hed to try the air and weather of Aix, and we having an empty &s;eat in the coach I had offered it to her.&mdash;Mrs. Kingly looked inqui&s;itive, as much as to &s;ay, "do you know who &s;he is." But &s;he repre&s;&s;ed the impul&s;e of curio&s;ity and made enquiries after my dear mother, whom &s;he did not know till then, was in &s;o dange|rous a &s;tate.</P>
<P>In about an hour Kingly came in, when after the fir&s;t &s;alutations were pa&s;t, he be|gan to recognize Clara, I think it would be impo&s;&s;ible to give you an adequate idea of the anger and contempt that agitated his expre&s;&s;ive countenance, her pre&s;ence was a re&s;traint upon us all, it checked conver|&s;ation, we were for &s;ome moments &s;ilent and embarra&s;&s;ed&mdash;&s;he &s;aw it and gue&s;&s;ing the

cau&s;e, complained of weakne&s;s and fatigue and ringing for a light retired to her chamber.</P>
<P>She was no &s;ooner gone than Kingly cried "why Mrs. Rook&s;by, how long have you been acquainted with that woman."</P>
<P>"Some time," I replied affecting as much ea&s;e as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"Had you any knowledge of her before you were married?"</P>
<P>"O yes, I knew her very well; come I know what you would &s;ay, but I &s;hall &s;top you at once; her former errors are nothing to me; at pre&s;ent &s;he is in di&s;tre&s;s. It was in my power to render her a trifling &s;ervice, and I only followed the dictates of huma|nity."</P>
<P>"Neglecting tho&s;e of common prudence," interrupted he tartly.</P>
<P>"P&s;haw! non&s;en&s;e," I replied laughing, "do not let us talk any more about her."</P>
<P>"You are the mo&s;t unaccountable wo|man," &s;aid he, "that ever exi&s;ted, I declare
<PB N="146" REF="029439_0476_0FE118EB1B215FA0">
if almo&s;t half your life is not an inexplicable riddle."</P>
<P>"My dear," &s;aid Mrs. Kingly, to turn the conver&s;ation, "my cou&s;ins have taken their pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame packet with us; &s;o we &s;hall cro&s;s the channel together." This had the de&s;ired effect; we in&s;en&s;ibly fell into mutual enquiries concerning the motives of our intended voyage: the conver&s;ation be|came by degrees cheerful, and Clara was for the moment forgot. I found that Mr. and Mrs. Kingly were merely on a jaunt of plea|&s;ure, and that we &s;hould have their company no farther than Calais, as they intended to proceed to Bru&s;&s;els. But, my dear Celia, vain are the appointments of man; we look forward to many coming years, we mark out plans of future plea&s;ure and enjoyment: and cry, Thus we will do, and thus. When &s;ud|denly the unexpected bla&s;ts of adver&s;ity pa&s;s over us, the beauteous vi&s;ion fades before our &s;ight, while darkne&s;s clouds and tempe&s;t &s;hut the expected joys forever from our view, and hurl them far beyond our reach.</P>
<P>Like &s;ome poor hind, who during the fa|tigues of the day, had looked often wi&s;hfully toward a di&s;tant &s;hady grove, where he might repo&s;e from the &s;corching noon-day &s;un.&mdash;"When my daily ta&s;k is ended," &s;ays he,

"I will retire there, and as I re&s;t my weary limbs, enjoy the cool refre&s;hing breezes as they pa&s;s over the banks of flowers." The&s;e reflections &s;weeten his toil, and he ta&s;tes a thou&s;and times by anticipation the plea&s;ures he expects to enjoy. At length the hour arrives, he quits his labour and ha&s;tily flies to the &s;cene of fancy, promi&s;ed bli&s;s. "How delightful is the cooling &s;hade," he cries, as he draws near the grove; "how charming the gurgling of the clear &s;tream that glides over the pebbles and falls into a ba&s;on formed by nature; how delicious the fruit that hangs from the trees and courts the hand to gather them. Oh! I could live and die in &s;o &s;weet a place. How happy I &s;hall be, when I reach it, and &s;tretch my weary limbs on the &s;oft gra&s;&s;y turf."&mdash;Alas! poor &s;wain, do&s;t thou not &s;ee the &s;un is &s;unk beneath the hills, the gloom of evening comes on apace, and e'er thou can&s;t reach thy de&s;ired haven, the clouds of night will ob&s;cure its beauties from thy view, and the chilly dews prevent your tak|ing the repo&s;e you &s;o ardently wi&s;h fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 30, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE pa&s;&s;ed the night as propo&s;ed at Do|ver, and at an early hour were called to go on board the packet, the wind and tide both favouring us. We embarked before it was well light, and the wind fre&s;hening as we proceeded we were &s;oon obliged to retire to our cabins, being &s;eized with the &s;ickne&s;s incident to tho&s;e, who are unu&s;ed to the boi&s;terous element.&mdash;For &s;ome time we were too ill to pay much attention to the motion of the ve&s;&s;el, but at length I thought it was very violent, and enquired of Kingly, if it was u&s;ual to be &s;o much to&s;&s;ed about in cro&s;&s;ing the channel; his reply alarmed me; "the wind is changed," &s;aid he, "and the clouds threathen a boi&s;terous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; we &s;hall make good &s;ailors of you all, for I do not
<PB N="149" REF="029439_0479_0FE118F6DEE1D2A0">
think you will reach Calais to-day, at lea&s;t not till late in the evening."</P>
<P>Soon after this the wind increa&s;ed to a tremendous degree, and I &s;aw by Kingly's countenance that he was unea&s;y. He went frequently upon deck; then returned to the cabin, endeavoured to chear us, and &s;aid he had advi&s;ed the Ma&s;ter to turn back as the wind was &s;o much again&s;t us, and we &s;hould not feel the &s;urges &s;o much, when we went before it. Happy would it have been for us all, if this advice had been taken while day|light remained; but the man was ob&s;tinate, and continued beating about till nearly the clo&s;e of day; then finding it impo&s;&s;ible to make his intended port, attempted to return to Dover. As night came on, the &s;torm increa&s;ed, and though &s;o late in the &s;ea&s;on was attended with the mo&s;t vivid lightning and heavy claps of thunder; the &s;ea was unu&s;ually agitated, the wind varying almo&s;t every in&s;tant and re&s;ting at no &s;ettled point. It is impo&s;&s;ible, my dear Celia, to give you an adequate idea of the horrors of our &s;itu|ation in &s;o &s;mall a ve&s;&s;el, driving about at the mercy of the waves and wind in a night, the pitchy darkne&s;s of which was only alle|viated by lightning, which &s;erved to give us momentary views of the &s;urrounding dan|gers. And how &s;hall I tell my dear Celia,
<PB N="150" REF="029439_0480_0FE118FC649F0000">
that in the mid&s;t of this di&s;tre&s;s and terror, I had one pang to encounter more acute by far than the near approach of expected death. Rook&s;by attached him&s;elf entirely to Clara. All his care, all his anxious &s;olicitude was expre&s;&s;ed for her. We had all ri&s;en from our beds, Kingly &s;upported his wife in his arms. "My dear boys," &s;aid &s;he, "Hea|ven protect them."&mdash;"Heaven will pro|tect us all, I hope my love," &s;aid he, pa&s;|&s;ing his hand acro&s;s his eyes.</P>
<P>Rook&s;by &s;at in a di&s;tant corner of the cabin be&s;ide Clara, who re&s;ted her head up|on his &s;houlder. Sad and &s;olitary, I &s;up|ported my&s;elf again&s;t a table, that was fa&s;|tened to the cabin floor, and re&s;igning my|&s;elf to that Power, who could in an in&s;tant either re&s;cue us from impending death, or plunge us at once into eternity&mdash;thus gave the reigns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o reflection. Through every &s;cene of my pa&s;t life, how large has been my portion of mi&s;ery, and how &s;mall com|paratively, my allotment of joy: then why, coward &s;oul, do&s;t thou &s;hrink from the friendly &s;troke, that will &s;et thee free from the heavy clog of mortality, and lift thee above the&s;e regions of tran&s;itory, fading joys, to one where plea&s;ure will be immuta|ble, unchangeable and can never end!&mdash;Oh! Almighty Father of the Univer&s;e, weary as
<PB N="151" REF="029439_0481_0FE119012FCB2B20">
my pilgrimage has been, I acknowledge thy mercies have been ever beyond my de&s;erts; to thee then do I commit my&s;elf&mdash;do with me as thou wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;only; Oh! benignant Crea|tor, grant me a portion of meekne&s;s and re|&s;ignation equal to my afflictions. Thou art the Father of the fatherle&s;s; under thy pro|tecting care my child will ever be &s;ecure. Do thou never for&s;ake her in the hour of trial, and of thy mercy, grant &s;he may never forget thee. Forgive my manifold offences, as from my &s;oul I pardon every offence I may have received from my fellow-creatures. As the&s;e reflections pa&s;&s;ed through my mind, I felt a calm &s;erenity take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul. I looked with an eye of complacency on Clara and Rook&s;by, who&s;e horrors were de|picted on their pale countenances, I even wi&s;h|ed them peace of mind and fortitude to meet the impending danger as they ought. This world &s;eemed fleeting from before my eyes, and I looked forward with humble hope, to that which was to come.</P>
<P>"Chearily! chearily! my dear cou&s;in," &s;aid Kingly, taking my hand, which hung motionle&s;s by my &s;ide, "come, come, we are worth half a dozen dead folks yet.&mdash;'Tis a tight little ve&s;&s;el&mdash;my life for it, we weather the &s;torm, and this will be a &s;ea&s;on|ing
<PB N="152" REF="029439_0482_0FE11906A2051370">
for you. You will not be ea&s;ily fright|ened after this."</P>
<P>"My dear Mrs. Rook&s;by," &s;aid Mrs. Kingly, laying her hand on that of mine, which her hu&s;band held, "how much rea|&s;on you have, to hate me, and all my fa|mily."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h," &s;aid I, (frightened, lea&s;t &s;he was going to reveal my &s;ecret) believe me, I love and re&s;pect all of your family, whom I have ever known."</P>
<P>"Do not &s;ay &s;o, thou much injured wo|man, look there, (pointing to Rook&s;by) You cannot e&s;teem that wretch, and yet you are linked to him for life, while the only man capable of rewarding virtue like yours: but no matter, 'tis I have done it all, and I de&s;erve to be unhappy."</P>
<P>I was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to hear her talk in this manner. But before I could inter|rupt her, &s;he thus continued.</P>
<P>"We are now, my dear cou&s;in, hovering on the brink of eternity. Which of us, or whether any may e&s;cape the horrors of this awful night, heaven alone can tell; but we have both children. Promi&s;e me then my
<PB N="153" REF="029439_0483_0FE1190B899EB908">
friend, &s;hould you &s;urvive, to be a mother to my poor babes, while they &s;hall require a mother's tender care: and &s;hould it be my fate to e&s;cape and yours to peri&s;h; here in my Maker's &s;ight, I &s;wear to con&s;ider your Clementina as my own child."</P>
<P>She had hardly &s;poke, when a &s;evere &s;hock which the ve&s;&s;el received convinced us we had &s;truck on &s;ome rocks, and immediate|ly from the deck i&s;&s;ued a confu&s;ed noi&s;e of "lo&s;t! gone! all is over!"</P>
<P>Rook&s;by &s;tarted from his &s;eat and cla&s;p|ing Clara in his arms, ru&s;hed upon the deck: Kingly did the &s;ame by his wife. The love of life &s;till prevailed over the &s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery and I followed them as well as I was able, crawling on my hands and knees up the &s;teps. Kingly met me ju&s;t as I had reached the top and taking me in his arms carried me to his wife. Here a new &s;cene of horror di&s;cover|ed it&s;elf; the day had begun to dawn ju&s;t enough to &s;hew us that we were on a reef of rocks which ran a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and that the rage of the breakers, while the wind continued &s;o violent would prevent any boat from coming to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>"See," cried Mrs. Kingly, "there is no hope." I could not an&s;wer.&mdash;We &s;unk upon
<PB N="154" REF="029439_0484_0FE11910A6B0CCE8">
the deck folded in each others arms, Kingly knelt be&s;ide and endeavoured to &s;upport us, and thus in &s;ilent agony, we waited the ex|pected &s;hock when our ve&s;&s;el would fall to pieces.</P>
<P>But it was near two hours before this event took place. At length unable to with|&s;tand the repeated &s;hocks, &s;he parted and I &s;aw Rook&s;by and Clara plunged into the waves.</P>
<P>My terrors and grief here became too great for human nature to &s;upport and I lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of my &s;ufferings. How long I re|mained in&s;en&s;ible I cannot tell, but on re|covering my recollection, I found my&s;elf alone on the wreck, &s;lightly fa&s;tened to it by a &s;mall cord, that was pa&s;&s;ed round my wai&s;t and tied to a ring on the remaining part of the deck.</P>
<P>The terrors which at that moment took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind, are &s;till too fre&s;h in my memory to &s;uffer me to proceed.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. MERIEL to CELIA. IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>

<P>I CONTINUED in this &s;ituation but a few moments&mdash;when I heard a faint voice call "Meriel," I turned my head and &s;aw Kingly emerging from the &s;ea and holding by part of the wreck&mdash;"Oh, Heavens!" &s;aid I, "are you alive then, and is there any chance of e&s;caping?"&mdash;"Some little chance," &s;aid he, coming near me and beginning to nutie the cord that was round me.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="029439_0487_0FE1191BC6A99CB8">
"But where is Mrs. Kingly?"&mdash;"Safe, I hope," he replied, "I have conveyed her on board a coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;el, which you may &s;ee at no great di&s;tance from us; but which cannot come nearer on account of the wind blowing &s;trong in &s;hore, and the &s;ea running &s;o high a boat could not live in it. Come, my dear Meriel, throw off the mo&s;t cumbrous part of your dre&s;s, the chance of &s;aving you is but very &s;mall; yet, &s;hould I be &s;o happy, I &s;hall e&s;teem my&s;elf ble&s;t be|yond expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;hould I fail, I &s;hall at lea&s;t have the &s;ati&s;faction of dying with the only woman I ever loved with ardency and &s;incerity."</P>
<P>"No, Kingly," &s;aid I, "if my life can only be pre&s;erved at the hazard of your's, leave me, I be&s;eech you, to my fate. I am a poor forlorn creature of no con&s;equence to any one:&mdash;here let me lay down the burthen of painful exi&s;tence!&mdash;Do you return to your amiable wife. You may alone &s;urvive the fury of the waves; but en|cumbered with me, it will be impo&s;&s;ible. Go, my kind, my dear friend, be a father to my child, and &s;ometimes think on her unhappy mother."</P>
<P>"Cea&s;e, dear Meriel, cea&s;e, thus to wound my heart, and trifle with the pre|cious moments in which I may &s;natch you
<PB N="5" REF="029439_0488_0FE1192099B72CF8">
from impending death. I once had fondly hoped to live only to render you happy;&mdash;but &s;ince fate has ordered it otherwi&s;e, I will pre&s;erve your life or peri&s;h in the at|tempt."</P>
<P>"Oh Kingly," I replied, "leave me, let me die while I am innocent. This gene|rous conduct awakens all the &s;oftne&s;s of my &s;oul, and &s;hould I live, I &s;hall live only to endure the tortures of hopele&s;s love, ren|dered doubly agonizing by the pang of con|&s;cious guilt."</P>
<P>"Deare&s;t, be&s;t of women," &s;aid he, "let me but pre&s;erve you, and certain I am that the rectitude of the heart that can harbour &s;uch fears will ever pre&s;erve you from the guilt it dreads."</P>
<P>The wind now &s;eemed a little to abate. I plainly &s;aw the ve&s;&s;el coming nearer&mdash;"Now is the time," &s;aid he, almo&s;t forci|bly tearing off my upper garments, and binding a long &s;hawl tight round my wai&s;t, he fa&s;tened it to his arm, and catching me up plunged into the water. I now became once more in&s;en&s;ible, nor do I remember the lea&s;t circum&s;tance that followed, till I awoke, as it were, from a profound &s;leep, and found my&s;elf in a bed on board a &s;mall dirty ve&s;|&s;el.
<PB N="6" REF="029439_0489_0FE1192628841DB8">
I rai&s;ed my head from the pillow and the fir&s;t object which met my eyes, was Kingly on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the cabin, ap|parently dead.&mdash;Mrs. Kingly with a pale haggard countenance hanging over him; and &s;tretched on a mattre&s;s, which was &s;pread on the cabin floor, lay Clara and Rook&s;by ju&s;t recovering from a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. Weak as I was I de&s;ired to be lifted from the bed and crawling to that on which my pre&s;erver lay, I began to enquire what means had been u&s;ed for his recovery. I found eve|ry proper, every probable method had been tried without effect; they al&s;o informed me, that he was alive, when they took us up, but immediately on his getting on board, na|ture exhau&s;ted with the exertions he had made to &s;ave me, had given way at once, and he &s;unk lifele&s;s on the deck. Tortured almo&s;t to madne&s;s by this account, I entreat|ed them to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew their applications&mdash;nay, weak and exhau&s;ted as we were, both Mrs. Kingly and my&s;elf joined our endeavours, while Rook&s;by and Clara drank a little bran|dy and water, and being covered up warm, fell into a profound &s;leep. For more than two hours we continued our applications without the lea&s;t appearance of &s;ucce&s;s; at length I was convinced I felt a faint palpi|tation of the heart. I mentioned my hopes to his wife, who thought the &s;ame. This
<PB N="7" REF="029439_0490_0FE11929ACB72C90">
gave us fre&s;h courage, and in le&s;s than ano|ther hour we had the &s;uperlative felicity of &s;eeing him open his eyes. The rapturous expre&s;&s;ions of joy that bur&s;t from Mrs. Kingly on this token of returning anima|tion are better imagined than de&s;cribed, nor was mine far &s;hort of what &s;he expre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;No &s;ooner were we a&s;certained of perfect &s;ucce&s;s by his gently pre&s;&s;ing our hands and &s;aintly articulating, "God ble&s;s you both," than bur&s;ting into tears of the mo&s;t exult|ing rapture, we &s;unk on our knees, and as we wept on each others bo&s;om, poured forth our thanks to that benignant Power, who had crowned our humble exertions with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Never Celia! no never! till that moment did I fully comprehend what real joy was: the tide of delight that ru&s;hed upon my heart when I heard him articulate the words "God ble&s;s you," more than compen&s;ated for all the angui&s;h I had ever endured. The ve&s;&s;el which had taken us up, was bound to Calais, whither it now bent its cour&s;e; the elements growing much calmer, and the wind becom|ing more favourable, and we were once more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on Terra Firma by three o'clock the next day.</P>
<P>I find the place, on which we were wreck|ed is a dangerous reef on the Su&s;&s;ex coa&s;t,
<PB N="8" REF="029439_0491_0FE1192FB2A04420">
fortunately, only one life was lo&s;t and that was poor Le&s;ter, as the ve&s;&s;el which pre&s;erved us &s;eeing our di&s;tre&s;s came as near as they po&s;&s;ibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould in hopes of rendering us &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance; Rook&s;by is an expert &s;wimmer and Clara a woman of intrepid &s;pirit.</P>
<P>We re&s;olved on &s;taying a day or two at Calais to recruit our &s;pirits. Indeed we all found our&s;elves a&s;toni&s;hingly recovered after a good nights re&s;t, except Mrs. Kingly, who appeared weak and languid, was unable to &s;it up and in the cour&s;e of the day was &s;eized with alarming faintings. Medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance was called in, but they declared her frame had received &s;o &s;evere a &s;hock that in all human probability &s;he would fall into a rapid decline; however change of &s;cene, chearful company, and invigorating medicines might prove great re&s;toratives.&mdash;This was a heavy &s;troke to poor Kingly. We were unable to &s;tay any longer than the next day with him and it was evident that his Margaret would not be able to travel &s;o early. But there was no alternative; my mother's danger pre&s;&s;ed us to pur&s;ue our journey, and accordingly the next morning we took leave of the droop|ing patient angel, and her afflicted hu&s;band, and &s;et forward for Aix, flattering our&s;elves that a few days would bring them to join us.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029439_0492_0FE11934B7EC0658">
On our arrival at Aix, Clara left us, and we proceeded to my mother's. Amelia met us at the door. "Is &s;he yet alive?" &s;aid I eagerly pre&s;&s;ing forward. "She is," replied Amelia, but greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. "We heard a packet was lo&s;t and feared it was the one in which you had embarked."&mdash;Before I could an&s;wer I found my&s;elf in Mrs. Rook&s;by's chamber. The dear woman held out her hand to me as I entered; but was unable to &s;peak. Rook&s;by approached her bed-&s;ide, took her other hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips with reverence; but we all remained &s;i|lent, I was plea&s;ed to &s;ee he &s;till retained &s;en&s;ibility enough to be &s;hocked at his mo|ther's altered appearance. When &s;he was a little recovered, "my dear children," &s;aid &s;he, pre&s;&s;ing our hands, "it diffu&s;es a tran|&s;ient gleam of plea&s;ure over my heart to &s;ee you once more, and to &s;ee you &s;afe and happy; how have you left my &s;weet Clementina, was &s;he well? does &s;he remember her grand|mother?"&mdash;I a&s;&s;ured her &s;he was in health, and if any thing could remain on her infant mind, it mu&s;t be the &s;en&s;e of her grandmo|ther's kindne&s;s and affection.&mdash;She &s;miled approbation, then turning to Rook&s;by&mdash;"Clement," &s;aid &s;he, "you are arrived in good time to clo&s;e my eyes and to &s;mooth my pa&s;&s;age to the grave, by pa&s;&s;ing an act of amne&s;ty with your amiable relation Captain
<PB N="10" REF="029439_0493_0FE11939D96B4748">
On&s;low. Come, promi&s;e me that the tri|fling cau&s;e of your di&s;pute &s;hall be no more remembered, and that you will rank him among the choice&s;t of your friends. I know he longs to convince you, that his affection toward you is unaltered."</P>
<P>"Your wi&s;h, my dear madam," he re|plied, "mu&s;t be to me a law. All our former differences are from this moment forgotten."&mdash;"'Tis well," &s;aid &s;he; "then to-morrow I hope to &s;ee my dear Mi&s;s Sidney exchange the name of virgin for that of wife. I &s;hall then have nothing more to wi&s;h in this world.</P>
<P>Amelia made no affected objections to this propo&s;al, and that evening Captain On&s;low took his tea with us. When the articles were &s;igned, in which he &s;ettles on my dear Amelia, five thou&s;and pounds, which was the beque&s;t Mrs. Rook&s;by mentioned to have made in her will; he al&s;o pre&s;ented her with a very hand&s;ome watch, a pair of bracelets &s;at with brilliants and a pair of diamond earings. The next morning &s;he accepted his hand at the altar with that mode&s;t re|&s;erve, free from every prudi&s;h affectation of ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which ever di&s;tingui&s;hes the real woman of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>From that time no material occurrence took place for three or four days; only that
<PB N="11" REF="029439_0494_0FE1193DE5CA1668">
I ob&s;erved my mother &s;eemed more chearful, and I flattered my&s;elf that our united atten|tions might contribute to her re&s;toration, I carefully concealed not only from her, but even from Amelia, the cau&s;e I had for &s;or|row, as I knew it would pain their friendly hearts, without in the lea&s;t relieving the an|gui&s;h of my own; though I knew by the frequent and long ab&s;ences of Rook&s;ky, that the chief part of his time was devoted to Cla|ra. But why, thought I, &s;hould I give my dear Amelia a bad opinion of a &s;tate, into which &s;he had ju&s;t entered, by revealing to her the art, the duplicity cruelty and perfidy of which man is capable. Will it not lead her to fear a future change in the hu&s;band, who is now &s;o fondly attached to her. Was not Rook&s;by once as fond of me, Oh! had he been like Kingly, hither tended all my reflections on the &s;ubject, I was terrified to find my&s;elf making the&s;e compari&s;ons and &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavoured to cha&s;e from my mind the only object on which it could dwell with de|light and grateful tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>But the&s;e ideas were &s;oon interrupted by the intru&s;ion of &s;ome &s;till more painful. My dear Mother was one morning &s;eized with a &s;it of coughing and expired before I could reach her apartment, though I was called the in&s;tant the attendants perceived her danger,
<PB N="12" REF="029439_0495_0FE119431FE65DD8">
though her death was hourly expected by tho&s;e about her, I had vainly flattered my&s;elf &s;he might recover; I therefore felt her &s;udden departure the more &s;everely, and as if my heart was not already overcharged with af|fliction on the &s;econd day after her decea&s;e, Amelia entered my apartment with a letter open in her hand. There was an air of me|lancholy and &s;urpri&s;e about her countenance, which awakened my curio&s;ity. My thoughts in&s;tantly reverted to England and my child. "Is Clementina ill"&mdash;cried I, eagerly, &s;natching at the letter.&mdash;"No!" &s;he repli|ed, folding it up and putting it in her pock|et, while &s;he calmly &s;eated her&s;elf be&s;ide me, "the letter is not from England."&mdash;"Are you &s;ure of that Amelia," &s;aid I, looking at her with a &s;crutinizing eye. "Per|fectly &s;o, my dear Meriel, but have you no other friends, in who&s;e welfare you are in|tere&s;ted be&s;ide tho&s;e you left in England." "Perhaps it is from Kingly?"&mdash;"You are right," &s;he replied, "and the contents are &s;o much le&s;s dreadful than your mind for|boded, that I think I may commit it to your peru&s;al."</P>
<P>"Poor Margaret is wor&s;e, I &s;ear," &s;aid I, as I took the letter. She made me no an|&s;wer, and I read it with a compo&s;ure at which I have &s;ince been a&s;toni&s;hed. I &s;end

<P>MISS SIDNEY is the friend of Meriel Howard (for I will not call that dear woman by the name of her unworthy hu&s;|band;) to her then I may addre&s;s my&s;elf and pour forth the &s;orrows that lie heavy at my heart.</P>
<P>Oh, Amelia! unle&s;s you could for a mo|ment place your&s;elf in my &s;ituation, you can have no idea of my wretchedne&s;s. My wife! my friend! my lovely! and beloved! Margaret is no more. I have taken up my pen to inform you of her placid, her hea|venly end:&mdash;but I feel I am unequal to the ta&s;k.&mdash;I mu&s;t pau&s;e.&mdash;My tears will flow.&mdash;in &s;uch a cau&s;e the brave&s;t need not blu&s;h to indulge their &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="029439_0498_0FE1194F31434460">
I am more compo&s;ed&mdash;I have gazed on the &s;erene countenance of my departed angel, and gathered fortitude from the re|membrance of her virtues; from that ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;troke which pierces my heart has &s;ecured to her felicity which will never end.</P>
<P>The di&s;order which alarmed us &s;o much, by its appearance, before Rook&s;by left Ca|lais, terminated in an inflammation on the lungs and a putrid &s;ore throat occa&s;ioned by the cold the dear creature had taken and the agitation her &s;pirits had undergone. It made rapid advances. She knew her own danger, and &s;eemed re&s;igned to quit the world, only that her heart yearned for her children: but even when &s;he thought of them, her pious &s;oul extracted con&s;olation from the reliance &s;he placed on a divine guardian and protector to whom &s;he &s;olemn|ly recommended them.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before the la&s;t awful &s;cene was clo&s;ed, &s;he called me to her bed-&s;ide, "Kingly," &s;aid &s;he, "I am going.&mdash;Four years of &s;u|perlative felicity is as much as humanity can expect. I am re&s;igned to my fate, and hum|bly

thank my bountiful Creator that I have not lived to know the privation of your af|fection. That, my dear Frederic, I fear would have been a trial to which my forti|tude would have proved unequal. I need not recommend my children to your care. I am &s;ati&s;fied you will never forget you are a father."</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured her of my con&s;tant attention and undeviating affection to tho&s;e dear pledges of our love, and begged &s;he would not too much exhau&s;t her&s;elf by talking.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t &s;peak, my love," &s;aid &s;he, "Alas! in a few hours that power will be denied me. I have &s;omething of importance to &s;ay. You have been vilely deceived. Mrs. Rook&s;|by ever loved you.&mdash;She is truth and purity it&s;elf."&mdash;</P>
<P>She was proceeding, when a kind of con|vul&s;ion &s;eized her&mdash;and &s;he recovered only to &s;peak in incoherent &s;entences&mdash;"Be the unalterable friend&mdash;She is worthy&mdash;In my cabinet you will"&mdash;She endeavoured to fini&s;h the &s;entence, but in vain&mdash;her eyes clo&s;ed&mdash;her gentle &s;pirit fled forever!&mdash;</P>
<P>The angui&s;h of my heart is better imagin|ed than de&s;cribed. Though I ever endea|voured

to promote the happine&s;s of my Mar|garet; yet, when I reflect that I did un|doubtedly love another, and that however, by the mo&s;t grateful attention, I endeavour|ed to veil my feelings from her, yet &s;he knew the &s;ituation of my heart, and knew the worth of the object. I cannot but fear it hurt her &s;en&s;ibility and preyed upon her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>I &s;hall immediately return to England to attend her remains to their la&s;t dreary man|&s;ion, &s;ettle my children, di&s;mi&s;s my &s;ervants and &s;olicit immediate employment; for idle|ne&s;s will only be the nur&s;e of affliction, and it is my duty to live and endeavour to re|cover my &s;pirits that I may attend to the dear beque&s;ts of my Margaret, be father! mother! every dear relation to her children, and the firm friend of&mdash;I need not write her name. I have &s;ometimes thought her capricious and incon&s;i&s;tent, but the words "you have been viley deceived," have awak|ened &s;entiments in my bo&s;om, which it is im|proper to indulge, tell her, my dear madam that while I live, I &s;hall con&s;ider my&s;elf as bound to &s;upport! honour! and protect her! Alas! what right have I to protect her? is &s;he not the wife of another?&mdash;Yes &s;he is,&mdash;but that other is a villain, as &s;uch every man

of honour and &s;en&s;ibility has a right to &s;tep forward in her defence.</P>
<P>"She is purity it&s;elf"&mdash;true but that pu|rity cannot excel the pure the friendly affec|tion that glows in my brea&s;t. A per&s;on who looks not beyond the &s;urface of things, may think that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are an in&s;ult, a &s;ure mark of di&s;re&s;pect, to the memory of my departed Margaret, but you my dear madam will con&s;ider them as they are meant a proof of my confidence in her veracity, a wi&s;h to fulfil her la&s;t de&s;ire.

<P>MY dear Celia may perhaps be &s;urprized that we did not attend the remains of our revered mother to England: but the ob&s;tinacy of Rook&s;by was not to be over come, and I was afraid to leave him le&s;t by my ab&s;ence I &s;hould appear to give a &s;anction to a connection which though I could not entirely prevent, I was determined as much as po&s;&s;ible to interrupt. My friendly Amelia
<PB N="20" REF="029439_0503_0FE119663AA50FC0">
and her hu&s;band were returning to England, and propo&s;ed &s;eeing the la&s;t duties fulfilled to my beloved parent, while I heavily and unwillingly attended Rook&s;by to Paris, where we were &s;oon joined by Clara and Belger, the former of whom has now thrown a&s;ide all re&s;traint, appearing publicly as the mi&s;|tre&s;s of Rook&s;by. Her hou&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;h|ment are elegant; &s;he gives &s;plendid enter|tainments, and though her infamy is well known, &s;he is courted, followed and care&s;|&s;ed by the fa&s;hionable world; while I am left a poor &s;olitary creature, in the mid&s;t of a bu&s;y multitude, without friend or com|forter.</P>
<P>The parting with Amelia was like &s;ever|ing &s;oul and body. I felt as if in lo&s;ing her, I lo&s;t all &s;upport, for though I am &s;en|&s;ible, that you, my dear Celia, compa&s;&s;ion|ate all my &s;ufferings, yet &s;ecluded as you are from the world, you cannot participate the &s;orrows of which you have no idea. I remember, once in the moment of exulting happine&s;s, I condemned the torpid gloom of a mona&s;tic life. Alas! have I not &s;ince had &s;ufficient cau&s;e to wi&s;h, that torpor, that in&s;en&s;ibility had been mine.

<P>I FEAR my dear friend that Rook&s;by is in the high road to ruin, Clara &s;ets no bounds to her extravagance. She gives &s;plen|did balls, concerts compo&s;ed of the fir&s;t per|formers, and pretends to countenance all the literati of the age; be&s;ides &s;he is an amateur in painting, and it is almo&s;t incredible what &s;ums &s;he &s;quanders, in the&s;e pur&s;uits. My dear little girl has now been with me three weeks. Su&s;an Mo&s;&s;op came over with her, Su&s;an is a lively girl and immediately attract|ed the notice of Belger. It gave me pain to &s;ee it, as I was too well acquainted with the principles of the man to think he meant an honourable attachment, and in a friendly manner warned her to beware. Would you believe it? my attention to her happine&s;s was con&s;trued into jealou&s;y, and from that moment &s;he has treated me with contempt and in&s;olence.</P>

I am ju&s;t informed a gentleman de&s;ires to &s;peak with me. It is &s;omething unu&s;ual for me to have a vi&s;itor e&s;pecially a male one. It may be &s;ome Engli&s;h acquaintance I mu&s;t leave you my Celia for a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Oh heavens! how hard are my trials: when will the throbbings of my bo&s;om cea&s;e!</P>
<P>When I left my pen and de&s;cended into the drawing room, the door of which &s;tood partly open, I &s;aw &s;itting with his back to|ward me, a gentleman in deep mourning. He aro&s;e as I entered. Conceive my &s;ur|prize.&mdash;It was Kingly.</P>
<P>"My Kingly," &s;aid I, endeavouring at a look of compo&s;ure, while my pale counte|nance and tremulous voice betrayed my emo|tions.&mdash;He took my hand, led me to a &s;opha and &s;eating him&s;elf be&s;ide me endeavoured in vain to re&s;train the tears that trembled in his expre&s;&s;ive eyes.</P>
<P>"I have obtained an appointment, my dear Cou&s;in" &s;aid he recovering him&s;elf "and in a few months &s;hall &s;ail on a three years

&s;tation to America: but I could not leave Europe, without taking a per&s;onal leave of the be&s;t of women and recommending to her care my dear boys, Heaven only knows what may be the fate of their father. Say, &s;hould I never return, will you be their mother, their coun&s;ellor, their friend?</P>
<P>"Surely Kingly," &s;aid I eagerly, "you cannot doubt my readine&s;s to render them every &s;ervice, within the narrow compa&s;s of my power. The friend&s;hip I bore their de|parted mother,&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And is there nothing due to the affec|tion with which you once honoured their unhappy father. Ah Meriel! your lauda|ble deception is now of no avail: in my dear Margaret's cabinet I found a letter written by her own hand and addre&s;&s;ed to me, in which &s;he explains every part of your conduct, which had before appeared &s;o my&s;terious. Yes my con&s;tant, my ador|ed Meriel, I am now &s;atisfied, that you mu&s;t have thought me the ba&s;e&s;t of mankind, as I at one time believed you the mo&s;t capri|cious of women: but I can ea&s;ily trace the black mi&s;chief to the fountain head. He&s;|ter Mo&s;&s;op, had frequently made me advan|ces, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take.&mdash;Need I tell you I &s;lighted her. Ah! my

beloved Meriel, how amply has her arts re|venged her &s;lighted beauty."</P>
<P>He caught my hands, while I in vain en|deavoured to &s;uppre&s;s my tears; but unable to command my voice &s;ufficiently to an&s;wer him, I continued &s;ilent and he proceeded.</P>
<P>"My own di&s;appointment, my own &s;uf|ferings I have learned to bear without com|plaining; but your's, dear Meriel, torture me beyond imagination. I &s;ee you married to a man, who ungratefully throws from him a gem, which might add &s;plendor to a diadem. I &s;ee you unhappy; and feel I have not the power to alleviate your &s;orrows.</P>
<P>"Your friendly anxiety," &s;aid I "does me honour; and while I po&s;&s;e&s;s the e&s;teem of my friends I can never think my&s;elf totally unhappy. But you mi&s;take, in thinking Mr. Rook&s;by"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Pardon me Meriel, I know you would endeavour to draw a veil over his vices; but they are too glaring. All the world mu&s;t &s;ee how you are injured!&mdash;Would to Heaven, Rook&s;by was not your hu&s;band, or that there was any way to oblige him to do you ju&s;tice without injuring your fame, which I would die to pre&s;erve un&s;potted."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="029439_0509_0FE11984AF070C18">
"Ah, Kingly!" &s;aid I, "your life is too precious to be lightly thrown away. Con|&s;ider your children&mdash;for their &s;ake, for the &s;ake of your friends, pre&s;erve it."</P>
<P>"And may I rank Mrs. Rook&s;by among tho&s;e friends, who are intere&s;ted in my &s;afe|ty?"</P>
<P>"Do you doubt it Kingly? who is there on earth &s;o dear?"&mdash;I pau&s;ed&mdash;I recol|lected I was a wife&mdash;I was a mother!&mdash;The glow of &s;elf-reproach, crim&s;oned my face. He &s;unk on his knees before me.</P>
<P>"Oh! mo&s;t adored of womankind! am I &s;till dear to thy heart?&mdash;Speak! fini&s;h the ble&s;&s;ed &s;entence! &s;ay you &s;till love me!&mdash;and I will live in the &s;weet hope that &s;ome happy moment may arrive, when every bar|rier will be removed!"&mdash;He pre&s;&s;ed my hands to his bo&s;om: my head &s;unk upon his &s;houlder and my tears flowed without re&s;traint. Oh, my Celia! let the prude, the rigidly virtuous blame me: the affection of my heart at that moment triumphed! I looked back to the time when to love him was no crime! the felicity I might, have enjoyed in his &s;ociety aro&s;e to my view! I felt, that &s;pite of all re&s;i&s;tance, I &s;till loved him, and was &s;till ardently beloved&mdash;but at
<PB N="27" REF="029439_0510_0FE119899039BF60">
the &s;ame moment, I remembered I could never be his.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Believe me," &s;aid I, "my heart has never wandered."</P>
<P>"Ten thou&s;and thanks!" cried he, wild|ly ki&s;&s;ing my hands. At that moment the door opened and Rook&s;by entered. To de|&s;cribe the &s;cene that en&s;ued would be impo&s;|&s;ible. I felt I had been to blame&mdash;I dared not a&s;&s;ert my innocence, though I had for|gotten my&s;elf but for a moment.&mdash;"Dete&s;t|ed villian," &s;aid he," darting a fierce look at Kingly; "and you prevaricating wretch, where now is your boa&s;ted virtue?"&mdash;He at the &s;ame time &s;eized me rudely by the arm: Kingly interpo&s;ed&mdash;"Dare not to treat your wife injuriou&s;ly&mdash;&s;he is an angel."</P>
<P>"An angel of darkne&s;s, I believe," &s;aid he, contemptuou&s;ly, "but I &s;hall expect to &s;ettle this matter in another place."</P>
<P>"Rook&s;by," &s;aid Kingly, with an air of dignity, "you are the hu&s;band of Meriel Howard. I believe you do not doubt my courage: but worlds &s;hould not tempt me to lift my hand again&s;t your life."</P>
<P>"Ba&s;e &s;ubterfuge&mdash;cowardly villain!"&mdash;cried the enraged Rook&s;by, and &s;truck him.

I &s;aw no more. Sen&s;e for&s;ook me and when I recovered, I found they had left the hou&s;e together. I am dreadfully agitated: Six hours have I pa&s;t in the mo&s;t agonizing &s;u&s;|pence; during which time, I have at inter|vals endeavoured to compo&s;e my perturbed &s;pirits by writing:&mdash;But, alas! I can no longer proceed. Intere&s;ted in the fate of both, &s;hould they fight, I am de&s;tined to be unhappy.</P>
<P>Rook&s;by is returned&mdash;Kingly is danger|ou&s;ly wounded, and in a few hours my hu&s;|band &s;ets off for Italy. I return to England with my child; but Su&s;an Mo&s;&s;op for&s;akes me in my di&s;tre&s;s and goes to Clara, where ruin and infamy, I fear, will &s;oon overtake her. I &s;hall write no more on this &s;ide the channel. Heaven grant that Kingly may recover, and Rook&s;by awaken to a &s;en&s;e of his errors. Then may the pale me&s;&s;enger of peace beckon me from this vale of &s;orrow to that ble&s;&s;ed man&s;ion, where the tear &s;hall cea&s;e to flow, and the heart be ea&s;ed of its angui&s;h.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Glamorgan&s;hire,</HI> <DATE><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 27<HI>th,</HI> 1784.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE ha&s;ty &s;crawl I wrote on my fir&s;t arrival in England,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Does not appear.</NOTE> informed you of my &s;afety; but there are many other things you no doubt wi&s;h to know, as you mu&s;t have been &s;urprized at my long &s;ilence. A variety of incidents have contributed to make me appear neglectful of my friend; but they are now all pa&s;t, and I am &s;ettled in a little neat retreat far from the bu&s;y &s;cenes of life, where my chief occupation is the care of my &s;weet girl. I think my Celia, after buffeting as I have done the waves of adver&s;ity, the calm &s;erenity of my little dwelling diffu&s;es a degree of comfort over my heart, to which it has long been a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>On my arrival in England, I went imme|diately to our hou&s;e in Harley-Street, where
<PB N="30" REF="029439_0513_0FE11998A1357AE8">
I &s;pent a week in the mo&s;t torturing &s;u&s;pence expecting every day to hear of Kingly's death, as I had de&s;ired a gentleman in Paris to inform me of that event immediately, if it &s;hould happen, or in ca&s;e of his recovery, to let me know when he was out of danger. My dear Amelia came to me the day after my arrival and every tender attention, which friend&s;hip could be&s;tow, I experienced from her and Captain On&s;low. At length the long expected letter arrived and I read, to my &s;urprize and joy, that Kingly was in a fair way of recovery. This was an infinite re|lief to my mind, and I began to regain &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure, which was only inter|rupted by the idea of parting with my friend Mrs. On&s;low, who was on the point of ac|companying her hu&s;band to India; but the privation of her &s;ociety was an event I was prepared to expect from the day of her marriage; I lamented it in &s;ilence, and only congratulated the dear woman on the felici|tous pro&s;pects that &s;eemed to await her, without damping her &s;pirits by a mention of my &s;orrows of which her departure from England was not the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>She had not been gone above a month, when I was alarmed and terrified by an execution coming into the hou&s;e, and on enquiring into my hu&s;band's affairs, learned
<PB N="31" REF="029439_0514_0FE1199B6E3F7E28">
that his folly and Clara's profligacy had in|volved him in irretrievable embarra&s;&s;ments; that he had mortgaged or &s;old almo&s;t all his property and could not command a thou&s;and pounds clear in the world, except the e&s;tates which had been &s;ettled on me at my marriage and the &s;mall one in Glamorgan&s;hire, which he had pre&s;ented to me previous to our union. I con&s;ulted with Mr. le Sage, a particular friend of Rook&s;by's whether any thing could be done to relieve him, and offered to cancel my marriage &s;ettlement; but of this he would not hear. However I determined to retrench every &s;uperfluous expen&s;e in my hou&s;e-keep|ing, to di&s;charge my &s;ervants and lay down my carriage. Having made this re&s;olution, I in&s;tantly &s;et about the execution of it, call|ed in all my accounts and paid to the utmo&s;t of my power every thing due, I then told Mr. le Sage that I &s;hould leave London and did not wi&s;h my place of re&s;idence to be known to many of my acquaintance; but that I &s;hould e&s;teem it a favour if he would inform me, whenever he heard of Rook&s;by, and forward to me any letters that might come from the continent. I then with only two &s;ervants &s;et forward for Glamorgan&s;hire. I found the journey very fatiguing e&s;pecially when I drew near its conclu&s;ion. My income was now very confined yet I thought two hundred a year would be a &s;ufficient &s;upport
<PB N="32" REF="029439_0515_0FE119A1329E4468">
for my&s;elf and child with economy, and would be a certain refuge for her, whenever I &s;hould be no more. As to my marriage &s;ettlement I did not con&s;ider it as my own, but held it merely with a view of being &s;er|viceable to my hu&s;band in any future emer|gency. Do not think, my dear Celia, I mean to in&s;inuate that affection for Rook&s;by led me to act thus. No, that had long been extinct, gratitude had at one time awakened in my bo&s;om an affection pure and tender, if not ardent, but his conduct &s;ince has en|tirely extingui&s;hed it, and whatever I do now proceeds from a motive of duty, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of right. He is the father of my child. He is the man I have &s;olemn|ly promi&s;ed to prefer to all his &s;ex. Oh! Celia! what an awful &s;tate is marriage and yet how thoughtle&s;sly do many ru&s;h into it. How ought we to reflect before we take a promi&s;e it may not be in our power to keep. While I live I hope my actions will ever be the re&s;ult of principle, and that principle rectitude. Let me perform my duty chear|fully, and leave the event to heaven. But I am wandering. When I drew near the hou&s;e which &s;tands on my little farm, I was &s;hock|ed to &s;ee how very de&s;olate it appeared, it had been untenanted two years and only a young man and his mother lived in one part of it; the one looked after the farm;
<PB N="33" REF="029439_0516_0FE119A512951868">
and the other milked the cows, made the butter and &s;ent it to market. Part of the garden was cultivated but the large&s;t half was over-run with weeds. Rook&s;by had not &s;een it for &s;even years pa&s;t, and in that time it had been &s;adly neglected, &s;o that though its original value had been two hundred pounds per year, it did not now produce half that &s;um. A cold chillne&s;s &s;eized my &s;pirits as we drove up to the gate; the wo|man had been taught to expect me for I wrote to the young man, that a couple of bed-rooms might be prepared and well aired; the coach &s;topped, the door was opened and from the hou&s;e come&mdash;judge who, my dear Celia. Why no other than my dear old nur&s;e, De|borah Ellis. I do really believe, I &s;creamed with joy when I &s;aw her. She, poor old &s;oul, had no remembrance of me; but &s;tood curt|&s;ying, and fearing my lady&s;hip was very much fatigued. I followed her into the hou&s;e&mdash;a &s;mall parlour wore the appearance of comfort; a table was covered with a clean coar&s;e cloth, and in a few moments Debo|rah brought in a couple of boiled chickens, a bottle of current wine, and every other appurtenance for dinner. I could not now withhold from di&s;covering my&s;elf: but &s;top|ping her as &s;he was about to leave the room, "Deborah," &s;aid I," have you forgot me Deborah." A &s;ilent look of enquiry and
<PB N="34" REF="029439_0517_0FE119AA70931AB8">
&s;urprize was her only reply. "Surely," &s;aid I, "you mu&s;t remember your poor little Meriel.&mdash;"Meriel madam! what my dear Mi&s;s Meriel Howard?"&mdash;"Yes Deborah, your own Meriel, pray &s;peak to me, I am Meriel Howard."&mdash;She laid her hand on my arm and looking earne&s;tly in my face the large drops of joy cha&s;ed each other down her aged countenance.&mdash;</P>
<P>"I think you are like her," &s;aid &s;he, "but you are altered, you did not u&s;ed to be &s;o thin nor &s;o pale." Then cla&s;ping me in her arms &s;he continued, "I know you now, for well I remember you was the child of afflic|tion.&mdash;</P>
<P>I then told her in as conci&s;e a manner as po&s;&s;ible every occurrence that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince my removal to London, &s;till carefully con|cealing every thing that might lead to the &s;ubject of my leaving &s;o abruptly Woodbine cott, and the unhappy con&s;equences that pre|ceded it. But I can plainly di&s;cover &s;he too well gue&s;&s;es the cau&s;e of that elopement.&mdash;She comforted and con&s;oled me under my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and declared &s;he would never again be &s;eperated from me. I learnt from her, that the mother of the young man who managed the farm, was her &s;i&s;ter, that &s;he was lately dead, and that &s;he her|&s;elf had come by her nephew's de&s;ire to get
<PB N="35" REF="029439_0518_0FE119AFA67FF118">
the rooms ready for his lady's coming; but &s;he had, no thought of finding in that lady the dear little girl, whom &s;he had nur&s;ed, and loved like a child of her own.</P>
<P>You will readily imagine, my dear Celia, that the pre&s;ence of Deborah greatly con|tributed to my comfort. I &s;oon got &s;ettled, di&s;charged my man &s;ervant, whom I had on|ly engaged to accompany me on my journey, and with Deborah and Lucy, a young woman whom I had engaged to wait on my&s;elf and attend Clementina, I entered on an entire new way of life; and believe me, when I &s;ay, it is by far the mo&s;t comfortable I have experienced for many years. Colin, Debo|rah's nephew, &s;uperintends the farm, which I flatter my&s;elf, will &s;oon be in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate. My old fa&s;hioned ca&s;ements are overun with je&s;mine and honey-&s;uckle, and before my door, are a variety of ro&s;es, pinks, &s;weet-williams, and other flowers, which, though common are not le&s;s &s;weet, than the rare and expen&s;ive exotics that flouri&s;h in the green-hou&s;es of the fir&s;t noblemen in England. My parlour and dining room are ormamented with pots of myrtle, geranium, mignionet, and balm of giliad; the furniture con&s;i&s;ting only of plain oak tables and neat matted chairs. My bed chamber and that of my child, is furni&s;hed with while dimity,
<PB N="36" REF="029439_0519_0FE119B52F010908">
but made as plain as po&s;&s;ible. Before I left London, I went to &s;ee Kingly's two chil|dren. They are in perfect health, and pla|ced where I think they will meet with eve|ry tenderne&s;s and attention. I engaged the lady under who&s;e care they are placed, to write frequently and inform me of their welfare; for &s;hould illne&s;s attack them, I &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment to fly to their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. The world might perhaps, blame me, yet &s;urely, my Celia, the world mu&s;t be more unfeeling than I have even yet found it, &s;hould the conduct of a woman incur its cen&s;ure, who having a child of her own, loves and compa&s;&s;ionates tho&s;e who are deprived of a mother's tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>In this retreat then, my friend, I hope to pa&s;s &s;ome few years in tranquillity. Even if Rook&s;by returns to England, he will be accompanied by Clara and I &s;hould be only thought a trouble&s;ome intruder; therefore, unle&s;s he requires it, I will not leave my re|tirement. Could I be of any &s;ervice to ward off any impending misfortune, or comfort him under affliction; &s;hould a declining &s;tate of health require the kind attention of a nur&s;e, then will I fly on the wings of duty, and prove my&s;elf a wife and friend. But alas! I fear he may perhaps even quit the world without my either &s;eeing him or know|ing
<PB N="37" REF="029439_0520_0FE119B7A8BF7138">
where he is; for he has not wrote to me &s;ince we parted at Paris, and knowing as I do his impetuous temper, I am &s;en&s;ible, e&s;pecially connected as he is with &s;uch a wo|man as Clara, he may be drawn into dan|gerous quarrels. But I grow tedious on this &s;ubject, which is ever uppermo&s;t in my thoughts, and cruel as he has behaved to me, I daily offer up a prayer for his &s;afety. Nay, &s;ometimes I fear, lea&s;t I have not loved him as I ought. Perhaps love &s;o ardent as his, was quick &s;ighted and could di&s;cover the difference between pa&s;&s;ion and friend|&s;hip: yet, from the fir&s;t of our acquaint|ance, I never attempted to deceive him or feign a tenderne&s;s I could not feel. Clara, I am certain has been the chief and only cau&s;e of alienating his affection from me.&mdash;I remember when I fir&s;t knew her as Mrs. Moreton at Ken&s;ington, I told her in the un|&s;u&s;pected openne&s;s of my heart every circum|&s;tance of my my life, my &s;incere attachment to Rainsforth, my misfortunes, my ra&s;h and im|prudent &s;tep to relieve my mother. The&s;e perhaps, with aggravated circum&s;tances have been repeated to Rook&s;by, and he has impu|ted my union with him to intere&s;ted motives. Nay, he might even think the reluctance I &s;hewed to it at fir&s;t was the effect of art.&mdash;The&s;e reflections often lead me to think more favourably of his conduct than perhaps
<PB N="38" REF="029439_0521_0FE119BD768A18E0">
others will &s;ay it de&s;erves. While I ever be|haved to him in one uniform manner, ten|der, attentive, but calm and &s;erene. Clara has no doubt affected the mo&s;t impetuous pa&s;&s;ion and by his means has gained that a&s;cendency over him which I greatly fear will end but in his total ruin or death.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI>29<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received a letter from Kingly. He is going on a three years &s;tation to Ame|rica. May the God of Battles defend him. He had heard of Rook&s;by's misfortunes and &s;ent me a letter of credit on his banker; but of this no nece&s;&s;ity whatever, &s;hould tempt me to avail my&s;elf. No, Celia, I feel my heart too much oppre&s;&s;ed already with the weight of obligation. I am already but too apt to make compari&s;ons of what is, and what might have been my fate, and this &s;hall be the la&s;t time I will indulge my&s;elf in writing of him to you. Speak of him, I cannot, as no per&s;on here knows him; and I will endeavour not to think of him, for when I remember that there is &s;uch a man, I mu&s;t al&s;o remember that it was he fir&s;t taught my heart affection, it was he who &s;aved my life almo&s;t at the expen&s;e of his own, and that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as he is of every
<PB N="39" REF="029439_0522_0FE119C26CF4E558">
amiable quality, he is unhappy.&mdash;Oh! human nature, how weak thou art!&mdash;Poor un&s;table beings that we are, con&s;cious of our errors, we &s;uffer rea&s;on to take the reins for a moment, and renounce them! But, &s;carce has the renunciation pa&s;t our lips, perhaps in the very in&s;tant of &s;elf ap|plau&s;e, &s;ome trifling circum&s;tance will awa|ken the feelings of our hearts, and we, im|perceptibly, return to tho&s;e very follies, the remembrance of which, had covered us with confu&s;ion!&mdash;</P>
<P>Adieu!&mdash;dear Celia&mdash;remember me in your pious orai&s;ons, and continue to let me hear from you. I &s;hall write, but my let|ter will contain only the in&s;ipid detail of what pa&s;&s;es at my &s;olitaty habitation, or the, perhaps, not le&s;s in&s;ipid encomiums a fond mother will be&s;tow in enumerating the growing perfections of a darling child.&mdash;Oh! may that child live to be my comfort|er. I will hide her from the world, and all its allurements: So, may &s;he never! never! feel its excruciating pains!&mdash;I will make my will, Celia, and leave this idol of my &s;oul to your care, in ca&s;e it &s;hould plea&s;e Hea|ven to deprive her of her mother. You, I know, will teach her that in the bo&s;om of retirement, &s;he alone can find peace. Oh how ble&s;t the heart who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility has

never been awakened, who, though dead to all the joys of love or friend&s;hip, feels not the pang of di&s;appointment, or the pierc|ing &s;ting of ingratitude!&mdash;Once more, Adieu!&mdash;May Heaven ever ble&s;s you.</P>

<P>HAVE you never heard, my dear Celia, that mariners, who are accu&s;tomed to the vici&s;&s;itudes of the un&s;table element, never experience a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of calm &s;erene weather, but they hold them&s;elves prepared for a heavy &s;torm. The &s;ea is deceitful and the inexperienced &s;ailor may be lo&s;t e'r he is aware of danger. This has been my ca&s;e. Lulled into &s;ecurity by the calm I had been allowed to enjoy I fondly flattered my&s;elf that I &s;hould &s;ink quietly into oblivion, forgetting and forgotten by the world. The accounts I heard of my hu&s;band were vague and im|probable. I was at a lo&s;s to think how he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. I was told he had &s;unk into the dete&s;ted character of a &s;harper and gambler. He never wrote to me, never enquired for me; nay, I was once informed that he had &s;pread a report of my death. A few days

<P>Mr. Rook&s;by is in England. He arrived at my hou&s;e la&s;t night extremely ill both in body and mind; he informed me in a few almo&s;t incoherent words, that he had killed a man at Bru&s;&s;els, where he has re&s;ided for &s;ome time, that in the fray he met with a &s;light wound in his &s;houlder, which had ne|ver been properly dre&s;&s;ed, as his &s;ervant had hurried him to England with the utmo&s;t ra|pidity, and that he him&s;elf was unwilling to &s;top after cro&s;&s;ing the channel till he arrived in London.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="029439_0526_0FE119D3D10BC118">
I found he was very much fatigued, and from the agitation of his &s;pirits and an|gui&s;h of the wound, very feveri&s;h. We per&s;uaded him to go to bed and &s;ent for a &s;urgeon, who examined the wound and pronounced it &s;light; but in a bad way from being neglected. He was very re&s;tle&s;s all night, and towards morning I thought rather wild in his di&s;cour&s;e, I a&s;ked him if I &s;hould &s;end for you,&mdash;"&s;end for who" &s;aid he, rai&s;ing him&s;elf ha&s;tily, for "Mrs. Rook&s;by? for which of them," &s;aid he, wildly "I have two wives."&mdash;I thought this was a certain indication of delirium and forbore to an|&s;wer him, but he caught hold of my hand and obliging me to &s;it down thus continued, "if you mean Meriel, I have injured her too much to expect &s;he will come, and as to Harriet, or Clara&mdash;Oh! do not tell Clara where I am!"&mdash;He then appeared violent|ly agitated and &s;oon after raved in a very incoherent manner.

<HEAD>MERIEL, IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<P>YOU will readily believe, that when the &s;hock my &s;pirits had received was a little &s;ub&s;ided, I &s;at about ha&s;ty preparations for my journey: I took Lucy with me and left Clementina in the care of Deborah. I made but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;toppages on the road, ta|king but little refre&s;hment, and no re&s;t till I arrived in town. Anxiety kept me up, nor was I &s;en&s;ible of the fatigue I had un|dergone:
<PB N="45" REF="029439_0528_0FE119DC37A63F10">
&mdash;But when I alighted in Wel|beck Street, and attempted to walk up &s;tairs, I found the exertion was beyond my &s;trength, and I &s;unk almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible on the landing place. Mr. Le Sage was very attentive and friendly, as was al&s;o his amiable daughter; and by their kindne&s;s I &s;oon found my&s;elf able to enquire after poor Rook&s;by. They told me he was bet|ter, that he knew I was expected, and, that he was impatient to &s;ee me. I rallied my &s;pirits, and having at the reque&s;t of my kind ho&s;t taken a gla&s;s of wine, I proceed|ed to the &s;ick chamber. I approached the bed cautiou&s;ly.&mdash;Good Heavens!&mdash;what havoc has intemperance and &s;ickne&s;s made in his per&s;on? How little &s;hould I have known him for the blooming elegant Clem|ent Rook&s;by, whom only &s;even years before I had accepted as my hu&s;band. Pale, ema|ciated, and haggard was his countenance; his words &s;o weak they could not be under|&s;tood. He fixed his eyes for an in&s;tant on me; his lips moved, he &s;tretched one hand out toward me and with the other covered his face. I took the offered hand; com|pa&s;&s;ion overpowered re&s;entment; I rai&s;ed it to my lips and wet it with my tears.</P>
<P>"Oh! thou dear generous woman," &s;aid he &s;aintly, "I have not de&s;erved this ten|derne&s;s
<PB N="46" REF="029439_0529_0FE119E1EDCBC140">
&mdash;I am a wretch, unworthy of your notice: but you are an angel of mercy come to whi&s;per pardon to my &s;oul that I may die in peace."</P>
<P>"You will live many years yet," &s;aid I, "many years in comfort and health."</P>
<P>"Never," &s;aid he, eagerly, "I do not wi&s;h to live. Health may return: but my heart will never know peace nor joy again; therefore. 'twere well, if it were cold and motionle&s;s. But, oh! my beloved&mdash;I do not de&s;erve to live and I am afraid to die!"</P>
<P>Here the nur&s;e interpo&s;ed, and I was forced to leave him; for while I &s;tayed, he per&s;i&s;ted in talking to me, which irritated the di&s;order. I had not left him long, when he &s;ent to know if I had brought Clementi|na with me; and &s;eemed greatly di&s;appoint|ed when he found I had not. His anxiety of &s;ee the child, plea&s;ed me, and tempted me to write to Deborah to come with her to town immediately. The tender a&s;&s;iduity, which inclination prompted me to &s;how my poor Rook&s;by, accelerated his recovery and in about &s;ix weeks I had the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing him able to bear a removal to a &s;mall hou&s;e we had taken at Pimlico. I had care|fully avoided &s;uffering him to dwell on pa&s;t di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances and endeavoured

by every means I could devi&s;e, to direct the melancholy I &s;aw daily increa&s;ing; but my attempts were vain, and indeed had I known the real &s;ource of that melancholy, my own heart would have been equally oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>We had been in our new habitation, but a fortnight, when one morning as we were at breakfa&s;t; two men entered and arre&s;ted Rook&s;by for a debt of five thou&s;and pounds. which he told me was a gaming debt, and the &s;ame which had involved him in the un|lucky quarrel at Bru&s;&s;els as he &s;u&s;pected the per&s;on who won it of him, did not win it fairly. I cannot tell you what I felt. Weak and low as he was, it was death to &s;ee him conveyed to a pri&s;on, yet that I knew mu&s;t be the inevitable con&s;equence of the arre&s;t, as I had no means to extricate him from that and &s;everal others of a &s;imilar nature, for which he had been draw in to give his note. With a heart almo&s;t breaking I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him de|part, and then immediately &s;ent for a lawyer, whom I determined to inve&s;t with power to &s;ell the little property we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, I did not con&s;ult Mr. Le Sage. I knew his cold Phi|lo&s;ophy would &s;trongly oppo&s;e my giving up my &s;ettlements. Yet &s;ure, my dear Celia, I &s;hould have been wrong to he&s;itate a mo|ment, or out of a pretended care for the future welfare of my child to &s;uffer her
<PB N="48" REF="029439_0531_0FE119EB5A40C3A0">
father oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;ickne&s;s and tortured by remor&s;e, for&s;aken by tho&s;e gay triflers, who once called them&s;elves his friends, to wa&s;te the remainder of his wretched life in a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>"When I had given every proper direc|tion for the rai&s;ing what money we could, and endeavouring to bring the unju&s;t holders of his notes to &s;ome compo&s;ition, I vi&s;ited him in his &s;ad abode and endeavoured to chear and comfort him. That duty fulfill|ed, I returned to my &s;olitary home and taking my dear girl on my lap gave a free vent to tears which flowed from real angui&s;h of heart.</P>
<P>Deborah brought in my tea. She &s;hut the windows, &s;tirred the fire and twice at|tempted to &s;peak; but the hone&s;t creature's own feelings were too acute to permit her to comfort me.</P>
<P>My poor Clementina, from &s;ympathy had laid her dear head on my bo&s;om and mixed her tears with mine "Mamma is &s;ick, De|borah," &s;aid &s;he. Deborah took her &s;ilently from me, wiped off the tears that trickled down her innocent face; once more attempt|ed to &s;peak, but unable to articulate turned ha&s;tily from me and wept aloud. How long

this &s;cene of mute &s;orrow would have con|tinued I know not; but we were arou&s;ed from it by a coach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and a loud rap at the door. I trembled, I knew not why; I wi&s;hed not to &s;ee any vi&s;itors, yet had not pre&s;ence of mind to forbid any one being admitted, and before I could compo&s;e my countenance or wipe away the traces of &s;or|row from my face the door opened and a mo&s;t lovely young woman entered. Her dre&s;s was &s;econd mourning, neat in the ex|treme and &s;he was vi&s;ibly pregnant. Her looks were characteri&s;tic of mode&s;ty and truth. Her manners at once attractive and commanding, &s;uch as &s;he appeared to me at that moment, fancy now repre&s;ents her to my mind, and I find, &s;orrowful as my heart is, it has yet a vulnerable part that feels for her afflictions.</P>
<P>She curt&s;yed and with a look and voice humility entreated pardon for the intru&s;ion, &s;he had hoped to have found Mr. Rook&s;by at home. "He will not be at home to-night madam," &s;aid I, as I entreated her to be &s;eated, "but if you will favour me with your commands I will &s;erve you to the utmo&s;t of my power."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, madam," &s;aid &s;he, "com|mands are not for the unfortunate, I came
<PB N="50" REF="029439_0533_0FE119F40EBEA0B0">
not to command but entreat.&mdash;To entreat Mr Rook&s;by will call to his rememberance an unhappy woman, who deprived of his friend&s;hip mu&s;t be forever lo&s;t."</P>
<P>"If you mean Mrs. Millar, madam," &s;aid I with &s;ome &s;urprize. "I am a&s;toni&s;hed &s;he could employ &s;o re&s;pectable a per&s;on on &s;o very improper a me&s;&s;age."</P>
<P>"Alas! madam I do not know Mrs. Millar, I have indeed heard of her and that &s;he had u&s;ed Mr. Rook&s;by extremely ill, but it is not for her I would plead, it is for my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Your&s;elf," cried I, in breathle&s;s agita|tion, "Does he owe you money."</P>
<P>"Oh no! no! he owes me &s;uccour and &s;upport, I am his wife! and he has for&s;aken me." I believe the wildne&s;s of my looks terri|fied her; for &s;he caught hold of my hand and thus proceeded.&mdash;"Dear madam, do not be angry, you perhaps are his &s;i&s;ter, you blame the unequal alliance. I was poor, madam; but indeed, I will never di&s;grace the name he has honoured me with."</P>
<P>She might have proceeded longer without interruption. A &s;udden &s;tupefaction &s;eemed
<PB N="51" REF="029439_0534_0FE119F7D4103B00">
to deprive me of &s;en&s;e or feeling. This agra|vation of my calamities was more than I could bear, and nature &s;unk under the &s;hock. She was alarmed and ha&s;tily rung the bell. The entrance of Deborah and the child awakened me to &s;en&s;ibility, and the tears which the dreadful di&s;covery I had ju&s;t made had &s;u&s;|pended, now gu&s;hed forth afre&s;h. I gave them free vent, and thanked heaven for the relief they gave my heart. When I became a little compo&s;ed, I reflected on the &s;ad in|telligence I had to communicate to my un|fortunate gue&s;t. At one moment I re&s;olved in compa&s;&s;ion to her &s;ituation to hide the truth from her; yet on reflection that ap|peared impo&s;&s;ible. My next care was how to break it to her in the tendere&s;t manner; I invited her to partake my repa&s;t, and &s;ooth|ed her by the kinde&s;t attention; yet by de|grees hinted to her that all was not as it &s;hould be, that I feared her expectations would be greatly di&s;appointed, that Rook&s;by was in trouble, and I would advi&s;e her at that time not to attempt to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>"But if he is in affliction, madam, is it not my duty to fly to him, though he has for&s;aken me."&mdash;"I fear, my dear, you would meet a &s;hock, &s;hould you attempt to &s;ee him. He at pre&s;ent could not with pro|priety receive you."&mdash;"Could not,&mdash;per|haps
<PB N="52" REF="029439_0535_0FE119FCEB0F8770">
you think he would not?"&mdash;"I do not mean &s;o. I never heard him mention you; but I know there are very forcible rea&s;ons again&s;t his receiving you; rea&s;ons which make it altogether impo&s;&s;ible for you to be with him.&mdash;Yet do not be alarmed though Mr. Rook&s;by cannot I will be your friend.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed as at one moment &s;he had com|prehended the extent of her misfortune, for &s;tarting ha&s;tily from her &s;eat &s;he cried "Oh! I &s;ee it all, you, you madam, are not his &s;i&s;ter, you are his wife, and I am undone forever!"</P>
<P>To give a proper force to the &s;cene during the re&s;t of the evening would be impo&s;&s;ible. I detained her with me and in the language of the pure&s;t &s;implicity, &s;he told a tale that for a moment &s;tole me from my own &s;orrow, to lament hers. I have reque&s;ted her to commit it to writing that I might tran&s;mit it to you. She has complied and bid me tell you if &s;he can &s;ave enough from the wreck of her little fortune to pay her entrance &s;he will come and in your convent bury her &s;hame and her misfortunes.

<P>I ARRIVED in England, dear On&s;low, ju&s;t in time to admini&s;ter relief to the mo&s;t amiable, mo&s;t lovely of her &s;ex. When I went to vi&s;it my dear boys, I enquired when they had &s;een Mrs. Rook&s;by. They told me that for &s;ome time pa&s;t they had neither &s;een or heard from her. I then re|paired to Le Sage, who I knew was Rook&s;|by's banker. From him I learned that Rook&s;by was in pri&s;on, and the dear wor|thy Meriel in di&s;tre&s;s for even the common nece&s;&s;aries of life. Her child, her beloved Clementina had been ill with the mea&s;les, and was even then in the utmo&s;t danger from a di&s;order which had &s;ettled on her lungs. I ha&s;tened to &s;eek her out, and found her, On&s;low, in a &s;mall lodging up three pair of &s;tairs, in the vicinity of the King's bench pri&s;on, where her unworthy
<PB N="58" REF="029439_0541_0FE11A16E2A9BBC8">
hu&s;band was confined. When I entered the room, &s;he was kneeling by the bed-&s;ide, her face, her hands, elevated towards that Hea|ven who&s;e mercy &s;he &s;upplicated in behalf of her dying child. Be&s;ide her knelt two lovely intere&s;ting boys, whom I afterwards learned were the children Rook&s;by had by Clara. I &s;poke to her. She took but little notice of me, for the feelings of a mother had ab&s;orbed every other. She &s;igned for me to &s;it down, and pointing to her daugh|ter looked unutterable angui&s;h. I enquired whether &s;he had proper advice and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; her an&s;wer cut me to the heart. She had not the means to procure proper medi|cal advice!&mdash;Every thing of value had been di&s;po&s;ed of to &s;upport her hu&s;|band.&mdash;I did not remain long with this dear &s;uffering angel!&mdash;But &s;ent a Phy|&s;ician and a nur&s;e to her, telling the lat|ter, I would defray every expence&mdash;for will you believe it, On&s;low, the dear crea|ture, though reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, had never availed her&s;elf of the letter of cre|dit I &s;ent her previous to my departure from England. On the third day after this ar|rangement, I called to enquire how &s;he was and found her &s;weet little girl had ju&s;t breathed her la&s;t. That was not a time to offer con&s;olation. I took the two boys from her, and gave orders for the funeral.
<PB N="59" REF="029439_0542_0FE11A19C3326F88">
She had a very decent woman with her, whom &s;he called Deborah, and who I &s;aw was both re&s;pectful and affectionate in her behaviour. I thought my company at that time might be more intru&s;ive than welcome; be&s;ides I was &s;en&s;ible the world was ever ready to cen&s;ure an unhappy woman, who in di&s;|tre&s;s met with friend&s;hip, however di&s;inter|e&s;ted from our &s;ex. I therefore determined to wait till the funeral was over, before I attempted to &s;ee my dear afflicted Meriel; but on the very evening that the child was buried, I received a me&s;&s;age from Deborah, &s;aying her mi&s;tre&s;s was extremely ill, and &s;he wi&s;hed I would come to her immediate|ly. I had been told that my adored girl had once before from the effect of a very heavy affliction, lo&s;t her &s;en&s;es for &s;ome days&mdash;(though what that affliction was, I never learned.)&mdash;But from this intelligence, I was prepared to find the &s;ame misfortune had befallen her. I was not deceived. She was writing when I entered the room, to a Mi&s;s Shelburne, with whom &s;he &s;pent the early part of her life in a convent at Bo|logne, &s;uch a letter, On&s;low, as would melt the mo&s;t obdurate heart. I waited till &s;he voluntarily re&s;igned her pen, which &s;he &s;oon did, when folding her letter and &s;peak|ing to me, as though I was her &s;ervant &s;he bade me make ha&s;te with it to the Po&s;t

or I &s;hould be too late. It was by &s;tratagem I got her to accompany me home, where I provided medical and other a&s;&s;i&s;tance. De|borah has faithfully attended her, and I am told &s;he is now in a fair way of recovery, though her &s;en&s;es are &s;till wandering.&mdash;During her confinement I have taken care that Rook&s;by &s;hould want for nothing; be|cau&s;e I believe it is the fir&s;t wi&s;h of the dear creature's heart. But I cannot bring my&s;elf to &s;ee or conver&s;e with a man, who has re|duced &s;o noble a mind as Meriel Howard's to in&s;anity; for &s;ure I am, her mental facul|ties mu&s;t have been greatly weakened by prior afflictions or &s;he would not &s;o power|fully have felt the lo&s;s of her child. Her pious &s;oul, if in the unimpaired u&s;e of her rea&s;on, would have &s;everely felt the privation but &s;till &s;ubmitted with patience.&mdash;</P>
<P>Deborah &s;ends for me. May it be good tidings from her, who is all in all to me, and who though the wife of another, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es my tendere&s;t affection. Blame me not, my right was prior to his, and believe me my affection is pure as the &s;oul of her who in|&s;pires it.</P>
<P>She is re&s;tored to rea&s;on, thanks be to heaven for it, I have not yet &s;een her, nor does &s;he know in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he is; but I

<P>ONCE more &s;natched from death, or what is to a thinking mind far wor&s;e, a total deprivation of rea&s;on; I have next to an al|mighty providence, to render thanks and ble&s;s the hand of Kingly. Why am I doomed to be thus obliged, where I have no power to return the obligation but by grateful prayers and tears; I have &s;ome faint recollec|tion of having wrote you a letter after the death of my beloved Clementina; but I fear it was very incoherent and hardly intelligible; but I will now endeavour to go back to the period when the poor young creature whom my hu&s;band had &s;o vilely deceived came to my hou&s;e at Pimlico. I re&s;olved to prevent her, if po&s;&s;ible, from &s;eeing Rook&s;by, as I knew it would only irritate his &s;ufferings, without in the lea&s;t alleviating her own; I therefore prevailed on her to remain with

me till I could form &s;ome plan that might be of u&s;e to her; and as I every day expected Kingly in England, I thought he might render him&s;elf of &s;ervice to her, without &s;ubjecting her to the unju&s;t cen&s;ures, which would be ca&s;t on me &s;hould I accept favours from his hands.</P>
<P>My time pa&s;&s;ed wretched enough for three weeks. At the end of that time I perceived that Harriet, which was the name of my <HI>Proteg&eacute;&eacute;</HI> appeared &s;omewhat more chearful and on enquiring the cau&s;e, &s;he informed me that &s;he was certain &s;he had &s;een her mother's brother pa&s;s our hou&s;e frequently, that &s;he had inquired his name and learned it was the &s;ame &s;he had thought it to be, that he lived in the neighbourhood and was a wealthy widow|er without children. From this information Harriet had conceived the idea of writing to him and faithfully explaining her unhappy circum&s;tances. She &s;hewed me the copy of a letter &s;he had prepared, which as it con|tained the chief events of her life, I reque&s;ted leave to &s;end to you.

<P>PERHAPS, my dear and honoured uncle will be both &s;urprized and offended to receive a letter from one whom no doubt he has heard, conducted her&s;elf in a manner that has thrown an odium on her family, I have been to blame, greatly to blame, but not &s;o very culpable as you and perhaps all the world imagine.</P>
<P>I am fully &s;en&s;ible of the many di&s;advan|tages I labour under, while addre&s;&s;ing you, yet when I remember that out of a numerous family you were the only one, who &s;hewed a friend&s;hip for my poor mother when her union with my father &s;o highly offended all. When I recollect the many in&s;tances of your affection I have my&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed when I was but a child, I cannot but hope you will not turn away from the daughter of that once loved &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;Oh! why was I &s;o early de|prived
<PB N="65" REF="029439_0548_0FE11A34E0773010">
of her maternal affection, or why did not the &s;ame &s;troke that &s;natched her from the world take al&s;o her unhappy daugh|ter; for &s;urely of all the forlorn beings the world contains a girl deprived of her mother is the mo&s;t pitiable. She may, it is true, meet with relations or friends that will in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upply her place, but alas! they will not have the watchful care, the fond &s;olicitude of a mother. Had I never lo&s;t that dear parent I &s;hould not have been the un|fortunate creature I am; for there is a &s;ort of tali&s;manic virtue in the very name of mo|ther, that while it fills our hearts with &s;en&s;ati|ons unde&s;cribably delightful, is tempered with &s;uch awe, &s;uch fear of giving pain or incur|ring di&s;plea&s;ure, that it mu&s;t be a very in&s;en|&s;ible daughter who would wilfully do either.</P>
<P>My dear father was the tendere&s;t, the fonde&s;t of parents, and &s;trained, to the ut|mo&s;t, his little income, to procure for me an education befitting a gentlewoman. He placed me as a boarder in a convent near Abbeville, his place of re&s;idence, that he might keep a watchful eye upon my con|duct; for the honour of his family and that of my mother's were ever dear to his heart, and he often &s;aid that he would &s;ooner &s;ee me in my coffin, whil&s;t a child, than have me live to fully the name I bore and the
<PB N="66" REF="029439_0549_0FE11A3A0729D8D8">
family I &s;prung from. My life pa&s;&s;ed in uninterrupted tranquillity, 'till I was &s;even|teen, at which period a Mademoi&s;elle St. Farr was going to leave the convent and marry. She had ever conceived a great e&s;|teem for me, was five years older than my|&s;elf and had re&s;ided in the convent from the death of her father, which happened when &s;he was very young. She was a woman of an enlightened under&s;tanding, lovely in her per&s;on and elegant in her manners. She ever pre&s;erved that dignity, which ren|ders our &s;ex re&s;pectable, yet mixed it with &s;uch charming vivacity, &s;uch &s;prightly wit and unaffected good humour that &s;he at once commanded re&s;pect and conciliated affec|tion. I have been thus minute in my de|&s;cription of Mademoi&s;elle St. Farr, that you might not be &s;urpri&s;ed at my father's rea|dy compliance with a reque&s;t &s;he made, that I &s;hould accompany her to Bru&s;&s;els, and remain with her during the winter &s;ea&s;on. Young and volatile my heart bounded at the pro&s;pect of the liberty and plea&s;ure I hoped to enjoy under her protection. Her hu&s;band Mon&s;ieur Melville was a gallant man, and from the day of their marriage, promoted every entertainment that he ima|gined could give plea&s;ure to a young beau|tiful woman, ju&s;t emerged from the gloom of a convent. But Madame Melville was a
<PB N="67" REF="029439_0550_0FE11A3D49099D28">
woman of too much di&s;cernment to &s;uffer di&s;&s;ipation and folly to have a moments a&s;|cendency over her mind. After &s;haring in the amu&s;ements of Bru&s;&s;els a few weeks, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h of living in a more dome&s;|tic manner, and retired to an elegant cha|theaux, which her hu&s;band po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the banks of the Seine. Thither I accompani|ed her: but, alas! &s;ir, my weak mind had been fa&s;cinated with the plea&s;ures of the gay world, and I had lo&s;t all ta&s;te for retirement, and rational &s;ociety. The account in &s;ome mea&s;ure for this change I mu&s;t candidly in|form you, that during my &s;tay at Bru&s;&s;els I had formed an acquaintance with an Eng|li&s;h gentleman of the name of Rook&s;by.&mdash;He was a man of fortune, lived in an ex|pen&s;ive &s;tile, and (I blu&s;h while I own it,) at that very time lived publicly with a wo|man of an abandoned character.</P>
<P>But, he had paid me numberle&s;s atten|tions and a profu&s;ion of compliments, &s;o fa&s;|cinating to the inxeperienced female heart, that I fancied, (fatal mi&s;take!) had he an affectionate wife, whom he loved; &s;he might reclaim him from the follies of which he &s;eemed &s;o fond. He had often profe&s;&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion for me, but not openly, and there my errors commenced; for at his reque&s;t I for|bore to mention his preten&s;ions of Mon&s;ieur
<PB N="68" REF="029439_0551_0FE11A4326264028">
or Madame Melville. That lady &s;oon di&s;|covered the alteration in my &s;pirits, after my leaving Bru&s;&s;els, and inquired into the cau&s;e. I evaded her kind que&s;tions: and &s;oon after her brother coming to their cha|theaux on a vi&s;it brought Rook&s;by with him. My chagrin vani&s;hed; I was again chearful and happy. A change &s;o vi&s;ible could not e&s;cape Madame Melville's penetration; &s;he imagined it might be the attractions of her brother (who was in every re&s;pect her coun|terpart) which had made an impre&s;&s;ion on my heart. With a &s;mile &s;he entreated my confidence; but by the unembarra&s;&s;ed air with which I an&s;wered her interrogations &s;he di&s;covered her error. The &s;mile was chang|ed to a look of apprehen&s;ion. "I hope Harriet, &s;aid &s;he, you have not li&s;tened to any flighty tales from that young Engli&s;h|man. I do not like his character. My brother brought him here from a motive of friend&s;hip to endeavour to detach him from a &s;et of gamblers, who in combination with a very vile woman, are leading him blind|fold to ruin. He is a very weak young man, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no &s;tability."</P>
<P>After this conver&s;ation &s;he kept a very &s;trict eye upon me, and &s;oon di&s;covered enough to make her think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end me back to the convent &s;ooner than &s;he at
<PB N="69" REF="029439_0552_0FE11A46D8646A50">
fir&s;t intended. Rook&s;by followed me&mdash;I had not attempted to conceal from him the &s;entiments he had in&s;pired me with. We found means to corre&s;pond: he laid a plan for my e&s;cape from the convent, I followed his pernicious councils, and we were pri|vately married; but under a &s;trict injunc|tion never to divulge our marriage till he &s;hould give me leave. Imagining that obe|dience to him was now become my fir&s;t du|ty, I took a mo&s;t &s;olemn oath, never to re|veal our union, though by &s;o doing, I could avert the heavie&s;t misfortune. Gracious Heaven! how little did I &s;u&s;pect the dread|ful calamity, which then hovered over my head? Happy as I was, in having, as I then thought, &s;ecured him to my&s;elf, I &s;till felt a con&s;iderable alloy from the reflection that I had acted undutifully to my dear father; that I planted a dagger in his heart, per|haps incurred his heavie&s;t malediction, yet dared not &s;ue to him for pardon. Another &s;ource of di&s;quiet was, that whenever Mr. Rook&s;by was ab&s;ent for any length of time, I &s;u&s;pected he was with Clara the woman he had &s;o publicly kept. To divert the me|lancholy, the&s;e fears occa&s;ioned, he propo|&s;ed going for a few weeks to Paris, and thi|ther I accompanied him. I had been there but ten days when one night, as I was at the opera, dre&s;&s;ed in the gaye&s;t &s;tile and in
<PB N="70" REF="029439_0553_0FE11A4CD3D3FD20">
company with a woman to whom he had introduced me. Ju&s;t as the performance began, I &s;aw Madame Melville enter a box oppo&s;ite to me, led by a gentleman who&s;e face was from me. Judge, my dear &s;ir, if po&s;&s;ible, my emotions, when he turned round to &s;eat him&s;elf, I di&s;covered my fa|ther. His pale dejected countenance &s;truck me with horror, an involuntary &s;hriek e&s;ca|ped me, he rai&s;ed his eyes, he &s;aw!&mdash;he knew me!&mdash;"Great God!" &s;aid he, cla&s;p|ing his hands, and &s;unk from the &s;eat in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. What my feelings were at that moment, I will not, I cannot pretend to de&s;cribe; nor can I tell how I got round from the box where I &s;at to the one that contained my father. All was con|fu&s;ion; but the di&s;traction of my brain pre|vented my attending to any thing, but my parent, whom I &s;aw before me to all appear|ance dead!&mdash;And, alas! bitter reflection, murdered by my ingratitude and di&s;obedi|ence!&mdash;</P>
<P>When he began to recover, madame Mel|ville hurried him out of the hou&s;e, and I followed them almo&s;t unknowingly into the carriage. My father &s;uffered me to hold his hands in mine, but did not &s;peak to me during the time we were going to Madame Melville hou&s;e. When we alighted, I per|cieved
<PB N="71" REF="029439_0554_0FE11A509E5F2198">
he trembled &s;o he could &s;carcely &s;tand. I followed him into a parlour, where he &s;unk upon a &s;opha. I fell on my knees before him. Forgive me, father, dear father, forgive me."</P>
<P>"Harriet," &s;aid he, "what am I to think from your appearance.&mdash;tell me, tell me in&s;tantly and without prevarication.&mdash;Are you married?"</P>
<P>"Do not a&s;k me, I cannot an&s;wer."&mdash;"Enough," &s;aid he, "I under&s;tand my di&s;|honour."&mdash;Oh! my father, will you not pronounce my pardon?</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid he feebly, "may heaven eternally ble&s;s you and forgive you as I do now." When I heard of your departure from the Convent it was like a bolt of ice &s;hot through my heart. Oh! child, I have not had a moments peace &s;ince; but, if my pardon can give you comfort, from my &s;oul I pardon you&mdash;But you are di&s;honoured. Oh! my child, how have you forgot what was due&mdash;</P>
<P>He was proceeding; but his voice faul|tered and his head &s;unk on my &s;houlder, I thought it was a return of his faintne&s;s, and &s;hrieked for help. Alas! how &s;hall I
<PB N="72" REF="029439_0555_0FE11A55F5DA25E8">
proceed. The horrors of that moment will never be blotted from my memory. We rai&s;ed and laid him on the &s;opha, we &s;trove to revive him; but in vain. His noble &s;oul had never known di&s;honour, and the &s;prings of life before exhau&s;ted by &s;ickne&s;s and many afflictions gave way at once under the pre&s;&s;ure of a calamity he was not prepared to bear. Oh! &s;ir, when I reflect on that night, when I remembered it was my folly, viper that I was; that &s;tung him to the heart, my brain turns round, and only that he forgave me, with his parting breath, the very idea would deprive me of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Madame Melville &s;uffered me to remain at her hou&s;e till the la&s;t duties ware paid to his beloved remains; but as my character was now become equivocal, &s;he forbore ever after to &s;hew me any countentnce. I &s;in|cerely lamented the privation of her friend|&s;hip, and the more as I found it was an ex|ample that was followed by every woman of character with whom &s;he was acquainted.</P>
<P>My &s;ituation on that account became ex|tremely painful, and I mentioned to Mr. Rook&s;by, my de&s;ire of returning to Abbe|ville, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;mall patri|mony my father had left me. He acqui|e&s;ced, and we &s;et forward immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="029439_0556_0FE11A589FE4F290">
Three months, three little months, pa&s;&s;ed on in tranquillity, when my hu&s;band inform|ed me he had particular bu&s;ine&s;s which call|ed him to Bru&s;&s;els, that it would be impo&s;|&s;ible for him to return, and he thought it mo&s;t expedient to &s;ell off what furniture, &amp;c. we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and to &s;ettle at that place.&mdash;Alas! my dear &s;ir, fond of his &s;ociety, and having no will but his, I he&s;itated not to comply.</P>
<P>At Bru&s;&s;els, a new &s;cene pre&s;ented it&s;elf; a &s;cene which gave me a pain, impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe! and which no one but a wife who loved as I did can po&s;&s;ibly conceive.&mdash;Mr. Rook&s;by renewed his connection with a &s;et of gamblers and &s;windlers, who live on the follies of the unwary.&mdash;He became their dupe and in a few months was a very beggar.&mdash;It was one hot afternoon, in the middle of Augu&s;t la&s;t, when overcome by the weight of the atmo&s;phere, and oppre&s;|&s;ed by my own reflections, I had retired to an arbour, which terminated the &s;mall &s;pace of garden belonging to the hou&s;e we occu|pied, and was endeavouring to divert my &s;orrow, by the peru&s;al of an Engli&s;h novel, which had been recommended to my no|tice. I was deeply intere&s;ted in the &s;or|rows of the "Wel&s;h Heire&s;s," (who never having known the plea&s;ures of maternal ten|derne&s;s,
<PB N="74" REF="029439_0557_0FE11A5E336CFE48">
felt her heart expand towards tho&s;e who&s;e affection &s;upplied the place of a mo|ther.) My mind was occupied, my heart &s;oftened, the tears &s;tole from my eyes, but they were tears that flowed from a &s;ource &s;o plea&s;ing, I wi&s;hed not to &s;top their cour&s;e: for while &s;ympathy for poor Anna's di&s;tre&s;|&s;es awakened my &s;en&s;ibility, I felt the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delight in the remembrance that there was an author, a female author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Bennett, author of <HI>Juvenile Indi&s;cretions,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>, who in conjunction with a Burney and Lee would &s;natch the Briti&s;h novel from oblivion, and future ages &s;hould with plea&s;ure peru&s;e the productions of her pen. Pardon me, &s;ir, but with &s;uch fervour do I revere tho&s;e &s;uper|latively happy few, who to a brilliant culti|vated under&s;tanding, add a fertile natural genius, an elegant refined ta&s;te, and great &s;en&s;ibility, all other &s;ubjects are forgotten, and I am like a rapt enthu&s;ia&s;t, all wonder and veneration. But to return to my&s;elf, I was employed in the peru&s;al of the Wel&s;h Heire&s;s, when Rook&s;by with a hurried &s;tep and embarra&s;&s;ed air entered the arbour: he &s;at down be&s;ide me, &s;truck his hand again&s;t his forehead, and breathed a &s;igh that &s;eem|ed to come from his heart. My dear uncle mu&s;t have a bad opinion of my heart, if he thinks fictitious di&s;tre&s;s could longer engro&s;s my thoughts, and though he had been from

me then above a fortnight, yet as I knew he was my hu&s;band&mdash;I al&s;o knew it was my duty to receive him on his return with a &s;mile, and, if po&s;&s;ible, alleviate the afflictions which &s;eemed to oppre&s;s him. I threw a&s;ide my book and taking his hand inquired the cau&s;e of this vi&s;ible dejection. He told me he was ruined pa&s;t redemption, that he had even lo&s;t more than he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the means to pay.&mdash;Unexperienced, my heart overflowing with affection, I endea|voured to &s;ooth his &s;orrows; and to calm the immediate perturbation of his mind, I put into his hands almo&s;t the whole of my worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: for I thought the mo&s;t abject poverty preferable to &s;eeing him la|bour under &s;uch dejection of &s;pirits. He left me &s;oon after and I, vi&s;ionary like, amu&s;ed my&s;elf with the hope of &s;eeing him return (after he had paid his debts of ho|nour) a true penitent, and that &s;ome little might be left from the wreck of his fortune, on which we might live in decent compe|tence retired from the world, and yet enjoy all the real ble&s;&s;ings of life.</P>
<P>But, alas! &s;ir, the&s;e plea&s;ing, delu&s;ive hopes la&s;ted but a &s;hort time. Night ad|vanced, and Rook&s;by did not return? Day after day pa&s;&s;ed, and I &s;aw him not! I &s;ent to inquire after him&mdash;he was &s;till with his di&s;|&s;olute

were the hours of &s;ickne&s;s, as they pre|v&eacute;nted my following and even in pri&s;on attending him. The anxiety of mind re|tarded my recovery, and I felt my&s;elf much hurt and neglected at receiving no tidings from Mr. Rook&s;by. At one moment, I thought him dead! at another, langui&s;hing on a bed of &s;ickne&s;s. At length, I heard by accident, that he was recovered from the con&s;equence of his wound, and this intelli|gence in &s;ome mea&s;ure relieving my anxiety, I began to regain my health, and when I was able &s;et forward for England. On my ar|rival in London, I went to a Mr. Le Sage, whom I had often heard Mr. Rook&s;by men|tion was his banker.

<HEAD>MERIEL, IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not long after this letter was di&s;|patched before Mr. Prevott came and per&s;onally offered to Harriet an a&s;ylum in his hou&s;e. Their meeting was tender I &s;hared her joys as far as my own unhappy &s;ituation would permit, but cordial as was the offered friend&s;hip of her uncle I could perceive he felt, &s;everely felt, poor Harriet's di&s;honour. I was greatly relieved by her having found &s;o able, &s;o proper a protector; for indeed, my dear Celia, I was reduced very low, and two days after &s;he left me I removed from the hou&s;e at Pimlico and which we had taken ready furni&s;hed. I di&s;charged my &s;ervant and would have per&s;uaded good Deborah to re|turn to Wales to her friends, offering to pay her expen&s;es home. But this was attempting an impo&s;&s;ibility. She told me I might &s;end her from my pre&s;ence, but no power &s;hould force her from London. She would remain near me, nay, &s;he would &s;erve me while &s;he had life. Such a proof of di&s;intere&s;ted fidelity awakened all my gratitude, and from that moment I took her for my companion, my friend, my advi&s;er, and we removed together to a &s;mall lodging near the King's bench pri&s;on, where poor Rook&s;by was by this
<PB N="80" REF="029439_0563_0FE11A778FC99C58">
time removed; for his di&s;tre&s;&s;es were &s;o complicated and his affairs in &s;uch a di&s;tract|ed &s;tate it was impo&s;&s;ible to procure his en|largement. Here it was I fir&s;t began my letter to you, in which I meant to have in|cluded the whole account of my &s;ad change, but my dear girl &s;ickened with the mea&s;les, and after langui&s;hing near a month was taken to eternal bli&s;s. I fear, my beloved Celia, I behaved in a manner unbecoming a Chri&s;tian, I did not &s;ubmit as I ought I gave way to de&s;pair and was puni&s;hed by the lo&s;s of rea&s;on, for &s;everal weeks. In this &s;ituation Kingly once more &s;tepped forward to pre&s;erve and re&s;cue me from the horrors of a mad hou&s;e; for to that dreadful &s;tate, or perhaps wor&s;e to that of a poor wandering lunatic de&s;titute and forlorn, I might have been re|duced but for his timely interpo&s;ition. He had me removed to his own lodgings, at|tended by the be&s;t Phy&s;icians, nay, he even extended his benevolence to my unfortunate hu&s;band, who&s;e feelings had been &s;trongly awakened by the death of his child. But tho&s;e feelings were &s;oon overcome, and his heart again become calous. When I fir&s;t began to recover my recollection, it was carefully concealed from me where I was. Deborah by degrees informed me of all that had pa&s;&s;ed and told me Kingly reque&s;ted to &s;ee me. I was too weak in mind and body to re&s;i&s;t,
<PB N="81" REF="029439_0564_0FE11A7ADD6C64F8">
and for &s;ome time I was accu&s;tomed to pa&s;s an hour or two with him every day, I &s;aw not the danger, the impropriety of my &s;itua|tion, till rou&s;ed from my dream of &s;ecurity by the following circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>I was well enough to leave my apartment for the adjoining room, where I had dined for the fir&s;t time with Kingly, who, as he &s;aid, to &s;urprize me agreeably had &s;ent for his dear boys from &s;chool, and al&s;o Clara's two children, whom he has taken under his protection. At the fir&s;t &s;ight of the children my &s;orrows all revived and I gave way to a vio|lent bur&s;t of tears, which relieved the oppre&s;|&s;ion that &s;eemed like a cord to be bound round my heart. I wept plentifully, nor did any one attempt to prevent me. The dear children had all by degrees drawn nearer to me, and the younge&s;t boy climbing on my lap, wiped off my tears with his frock, whil&s;t he ki&s;&s;ed me and bade me not cry any more. I know not how it was; but the angui&s;h of my heart gradually &s;ub&s;ided. I am not de&s;titute of comfort &s;aid I mentally; the&s;e dear children, the friend&s;hip of Kingly, is &s;omething yet! how many at this moment, a thou&s;and times more de&s;erving, are more wretched, more forlorn than I am. During dinner the&s;e reflections occupied my mind. I &s;poke little, but I felt a degree of &s;erenity
<PB N="82" REF="029439_0565_0FE11A806C505470">
pervade my brea&s;t, to which it had long been a &s;tranger. When the de&s;ert was re|moved, the boys growing rather boi&s;terous in their play were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to another apart|ment. Kingly &s;eated him&s;elf next me. We were for &s;ome moments &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"I hope," &s;aid Kingly, "my dear Mrs. Rook&s;by, you will now &s;oon be able to reap the benefit of fre&s;h air, and go for a &s;hort time into the country. It will be of great &s;ervice to you."</P>
<P>"I hope I &s;hall," replied I, "&s;oon be able to go out; for then I can go to poor Rook&s;|by, for I wi&s;h to &s;ee him and learn how he is accommodated; I fear he has been very un|comfortable during my illne&s;s."&mdash;"Surely my dear creature," &s;aid he, fixing his eyes on my face with a look of expre&s;&s;ive tender|ne&s;s, "&s;urely you cannot mean to return to that man."</P>
<P>"Why not, Mr. Kingly. He certainly wants a friend and comforter under his pre&s;ent unea&s;y circum&s;tances."&mdash;</P>
<P>"But are not his pre&s;ent calamities the fruit of his own folly; and has he not behaved in the ba&s;e&s;t manner to you? has he not for|feited all right&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="029439_0566_0FE11A84DE2B1948">
"Not to my duty and attention," &s;aid I, eagerly interrupting him, "if he has forgot his duty, it is no rule for me to neglect mine."</P>
<P>"But &s;hould you leave him, all the world would acquit you."</P>
<P>"Yes Kingly; but I mu&s;t be acquitted by a higher, a more &s;acred tribunal than the world. I &s;eek the approbation of my own con&s;cience, and the continued protection of a Being; wi&s;e! as he is great and merci|ful."&mdash;</P>
<P>"But &s;urely, my dear Meriel, as you have done your duty, nothing more can be expect|ed from you."</P>
<P>"Yes Kingly, yes while I live, and Rook&s;|by is in exi&s;tence I know my marriage vow is in full force; and may I &s;oon be able to fulfill the &s;acred engagements I entered into."</P>
<P>"Oh! Meriel you &s;urely love, &s;pite of his errors this ungrateful Rook&s;by."</P>
<P>"No&mdash;no,&mdash;mi&s;take me not, I mean not to arrogate to my&s;elf the merit of a virtue to
<PB N="84" REF="029439_0567_0FE11A89F6C93138">
which I have no claim. I pity him from my &s;oul, nay would &s;acrifice my own peace; to re&s;tore his tranquillity; but did I love him; Oh! gracious heaven, did I love him, I could not live and retain my rea&s;on under my pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances."</P>
<P>"Then, why Meriel, why will you &s;acri|fice your own peace, to a chimerical notion of duty? If you love him not, why return to him: why fly from a man, who not only loves, but almo&s;t adores you? Then &s;tay with me, thou beloved of my &s;oul, &s;hare my fortune and be the friend of my bo&s;om; Rook&s;by &s;hall enjoy all the comforts, nay if you require it, all the elegancies of life."</P>
<P>Shall I tell you, my friend, &s;hall I con|fe&s;s that &s;trong as was my &s;en&s;e of recti|tude, I felt my re&s;olution &s;lacken. My treacherous heart even debated whether I &s;hould not &s;tand excu&s;ed, if I accepted his offer.&mdash;Oh, God! pardon the weakne&s;s of frail humanity, if for a moment, I forgot what was due to the Deity I &s;erved&mdash;the religion I profe&s;&s;ed. Yes, Celia, I li&s;tened, I thought my&s;elf convinced, and had con|&s;ented to leave the man to whom I had pro|mi&s;ed love and obedience to the late&s;t pe|riod of our lives.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="029439_0568_0FE11A8CC648D360">
Kingly, though ardent in his wi&s;hes for me to be &s;eperated from my hu&s;band, was re&s;pectful in his behaviour and we pa&s;&s;ed the evening in a friendly conver&s;ation, which would not have called a blu&s;h on the cheek of a brother and &s;i&s;ter. Deborah had during my illne&s;s always &s;lept in my apartment. But a few nights preceding the one I have mentioned, we had prevailed on her to go to another room and &s;uffer one of Kingly's &s;ervants to occupy her place on a mattre&s;s by my bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P>When I was retired to re&s;t, when I no longer &s;aw the expre&s;&s;ive countenance, or heard the per&s;ua&s;ive tongue of Kingly, re|flection returned with double force, and I per|ceived I was &s;tanding on the brink of a pre|cipice, from which if I receded not in time, I mu&s;t plunge into everla&s;ting ruin. Weak as I &s;till was from the effects of my di&s;or|der, I re&s;olved to fly, while I had &s;ufficient rea&s;on left to direct me from the dangerous temptations which &s;urrounded me.&mdash;For&s;a|ken, injured by my hu&s;band, and under the immediate protection of the man, who fir&s;t taught my heart to beat with affection, who had conferred on me obligations I could never repay, who &s;till loved:&mdash;And, Oh! my dear Celia, (the glow of confu|&s;ion
<PB N="86" REF="029439_0569_0FE11A92B25D72A8">
covers me as I write it,) who &s;till was beloved by me.</P>
<P>To deliberate a moment; was to be lo&s;t, another &s;uch an interview as the la&s;t, and I might ru&s;h on irretrievable de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant who &s;lept in the room with me, wearied by the employments of the day enjoyed a &s;ound and undi&s;turbed repo&s;e&mdash;The clock had &s;truck three, when convinced of the danger of remaining longer under his roof, I re&s;olved to fly from Kingly. A can|dle was always burning in my room: I aro&s;e with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, wrapping my|&s;elf as warm as I could and tying up a change of linen in a handkerchief, I glided &s;oftly down &s;tairs, and opening the &s;treet door ventured into the &s;treet. I knew there were coaches employed in the night as well as the day, and did not fear but I &s;hould &s;oon find one to convey me to the hou&s;e where I had lodged, previous to the death of my ever regretted Clementina, and where I knew I &s;hould be received and might remain till the hour when I could be admit|ted into the pri&s;on to my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps, blame me, for leav|ing the protection of Kingly, in &s;o abrupt a manner. Perhaps you will &s;ay why not &s;tay
<PB N="87" REF="029439_0570_0FE11A98505D8F58">
till the morning, and then inform him of my re&s;olution.&mdash;Alas! my friend, I dared not &s;tay. I was &s;en&s;ible of the weakne&s;s of my heart, and had he intreated! had he looked unhappy! I know it would not have been in my power to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>His lodgings were in We&s;tmin&s;ter near the park, and I found no &s;tand of coaches near. Add to this, my weakne&s;s and the penetrating keenne&s;s of the night air, made my head &s;wim, and I &s;taggered like a per|&s;on intoxicated. I was proceeding as well as I was able toward We&s;tmin&s;ter bridge, when a cry of thieves and a watchman's rattle ar|re&s;ted my attention. I was then near the end of Parliament-&s;treet, and before I had time for a moments thought found my&s;elf &s;urrounded by a number of watchmen, con|&s;tables and other &s;trange looking people, who one and all, per&s;i&s;ted that I was an ac|complice with a gang of thieves, who had, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the hou&s;ekeeper, broke in and robbed a lady's hou&s;e in George|&s;treet.</P>
<P>I attempted to &s;peak; but had not the power. A cold chillne&s;s &s;eized me, and my limbs failed, though I &s;till retained my &s;en|&s;es and felt the horrors of my &s;ituation in their full force!&mdash;Imagine, my dear Ce|lia,
<PB N="88" REF="029439_0571_0FE11A9DCFCBEA30">
for a moment what my feelings were. I feared my rea&s;on would again wander: but it plea&s;ed Heaven to pre&s;erve me from that dreadful calamity. They conveyed me without re&s;i&s;tance to the watch-hou&s;e, where they threw me like a bea&s;t upon the floor, imagining my inanimation to proceed from the effects of liquor. Though unable to &s;peak, I groaned pitiou&s;ly and felt the tears gu&s;h in torrents from my eyes: but &s;till I was unnoticed by all, except a young creature who I am &s;ure could not have counted above &s;ixteen years, and who habited in a white bedgown, a tattered &s;ilk petticoat, and a pair of old &s;attin &s;hoes that would &s;carcely &s;ave her feet from the ground, &s;at in a cor|ner of the place near where they had thrown me down; and as I then verily believed, where I was to end my days. For the &s;ud|den &s;hock that had deprived me of the power of &s;peech and motion &s;eemed like the &s;troke of death, and I lifted up my &s;oul to that Pow|er who I thought was calling me to him&s;elf from a world, where from a child, I had ex|perienced little el&s;e but &s;orrow.</P>
<P>The poor girl, whom I heard them call Peggy, knelt down be&s;ide me rai&s;ed my head on her knee and put a &s;mall gla&s;s of warm punch to my mouth, which the con|&s;table had ju&s;t given her.&mdash;"Let her alone
<PB N="89" REF="029439_0572_0FE11AA229623530">
Peggy, &s;aid he, &s;he has had enough already. She is &s;o drunk &s;he can neither &s;peak nor &s;tand.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Poor &s;oul," cried Peggy, in an accent of the &s;ofte&s;t compa&s;&s;ion. "She is ill I can &s;ee &s;he is, and may die for want of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Come, continued &s;he, &s;wallow a drop of this. It may revive you."</P>
<P>Celia, the love of life is &s;o &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed on human nature, that though bend|ing beneath the weight of almo&s;t in&s;upport|able afflictions we &s;truggle &s;till to pre&s;erve exi&s;tence. I &s;wallowed the offered refre&s;h|ment, Peggy chaffed my hands and laid my head upon her bo&s;om; my &s;pirits revived, my &s;trength began to return and in le&s;s than half an hour I could articulate my thanks to my pre&s;erver. Till tea the en&s;uing morn|ing I remained in this mi&s;erable place, nor was I even able to procure the lea&s;t accom|modation for my&s;elf or companion in &s;or|row; for they had not only taken my bun|dle from me but even rifled my pockets of a guinea and a half, which was all that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the world. At ten o'clock a coach was called and with &s;everal others I was carried to a ju&s;tice's for examination; for it was alledged that I was the woman, who had opened the door to the thieves and
<PB N="90" REF="029439_0573_0FE11AA7458CF5A0">
that having got what booty I could my&s;elf, I was making off when they &s;topped me; in evidence of which they produced my little bundle which contained two &s;hifts a petti|coat two mu&s;lin handkerchiefs and a linen gown. The con&s;table al&s;o &s;wore that I had more property about me; but that I had thrown it away when they pur&s;ued me and they could find nothing but a gold watch chain which they had picked up, and which they immediately produced wrapped in a fine cambrick handkerchief. Judge my &s;urprize, Celia, when on opening the handkerchief I &s;aw my own watch chain, to which was fix|ed a miniature of my departed child &s;et round with pearls, and on which I had de&s;ired Deborah to rai&s;e &s;ome money, I imagine the faithful creature had deceived me and rai&s;|ed the money on &s;omething of her own&mdash;yet how the chain could be dropped by me was a my&s;tery, unle&s;s as I have &s;ince rea&s;on to think it was with the gown I had packed up and might drop from the bundle. During my examination, a coach &s;topped at the door and an elderly lady entered. It was the lady, who&s;e hou&s;e had been attempted. The moment &s;he &s;aw me &s;he pronounced me not guilty.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw her before, &s;aid &s;he, with vi|&s;ible emotion, and even had &s;he lived in my hou&s;e. I could not have &s;u&s;pected her.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="029439_0574_0FE11AAB6B7FF4B0">
I cannot, my dear Celia, de&s;cribe this lady to you &s;uch as &s;he appeared to me. There was a mixture of maje&s;ty and conde&s;cen&s;ion in her manner, her countenance beamed be|nignity, and it appeared a countenance ren|dered grave by affliction rather than that by nature. Several other per&s;ons were now brought in, who had been apprehended by other watchmen, and from a variety of evi|dences I was acquitted; when I heard tho&s;e words pa&s;s the ju&s;tice's lips, I was ha&s;tily leaving the place, but a man &s;topped me and told me I could not go till I had paid all fees.&mdash;"Indeed &s;ir," &s;aid I, in a voice &s;carcely audible, "I have no money; that watch chain I think was mine, yet how it came here I know not nor dare I demand it. Permit me to go and if ever it is in my power"&mdash;"I &s;hall do no &s;uch thing, mi&s;|tre&s;s," &s;aid the man, "either pay the fees or &s;tay in our cu&s;tody till you can."</P>
<P>I could not an&s;wer, but rai&s;ing my hands and eyes to heaven was returning in &s;ilent agony when the lady advanced and in|quired the cau&s;e of my new di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"And are the&s;e your Briti&s;h laws" &s;aid &s;he, "that when a per&s;on is fal&s;ely accu&s;ed and their innocence made perfectly appear, are they to be detained from their families
<PB N="92" REF="029439_0575_0FE11AB16EBDD200">
for the paltry con&s;ideration of a few &s;hil|lings?" She then put her hand in her pocket and pre&s;ented me with two guineas, at the &s;ame time a&s;king if &s;he could be of any further &s;ervice to me; I would have thanked her, but my feelings were too powerful to permit me to &s;peak, &s;he &s;aw my gratitude, &s;he perfectly comprehended from my looks more than words would convey.&mdash;"You intere&s;t me," &s;aid &s;he, "can you not tell me how I may &s;erve you. Oblige me, madam; make me your friend I will not abu&s;e your confidence; but pardon me, I am to blame. This is no place for conver&s;ation. Do me the favour to wait till I have fini&s;hed the di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s that brought me here, and then give me leave to take you to any place you wi&s;h to go to in my carriage."&mdash;I curt&s;yed my a&s;&s;ent to this humane propo&s;al, for in|deed Celia, I was unable to walk, and could but ill afford to procure a coach. Harra&s;&s;ed as my &s;pirits had been, my &s;trength was ex|hau&s;ted and I was almo&s;t &s;inking with faint|ne&s;s. When the lady had ended her bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he de&s;ired me to follow her, ju&s;t as we were &s;tepping out of the door, poor Peggy who was ju&s;t relea&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ed us on the &s;teps.&mdash;"Forgive me, madam," &s;aid I, "if I pre|&s;ume to &s;hare with this benevolent girl, the bounty of your hand. She did all in her power la&s;t night for me, I fear I &s;hould have
<PB N="93" REF="029439_0576_0FE11AB5B57A1428">
peri&s;hed, but for her humanity."&mdash;I then gave her the remainder of the guinea I had changed to pay the fees of the office. "God ble&s;s you," &s;aid &s;he, pre&s;&s;ing the hand that offered her the money, while the tears &s;tart|ed in her fine blue eyes. "And was &s;he kind to you?" &s;aid the lady. I repeated the circum&s;tance of the preceding night. "Good girl," &s;aid &s;he, "have you any friends?" addre&s;&s;ing Peggy.</P>
<P>"Oh! no Madam," I am a poor, guilty, forlorn creature: lo&s;t to every thing but a &s;en&s;e of my own mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>"So young, and yet accu&s;e your&s;elf of guilt." "Alas Madam, I was involved in guilt before I knew the value of virtue."</P>
<P>The lady an&s;wered not; but giving her a card, bade her call on her in the afternoon, and &s;he would do &s;omething for her.</P>
<P>"And now," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he &s;eated her|&s;elf in her carriage, "tell me where you wi&s;h to go."</P>
<P>"To the Kings bench pri&s;on, madam." "To a pri&s;on, good heavens! have you friends there?"</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="029439_0577_0FE11B1B99BAF1D0">
"My hu&s;band, madam, is confined there."</P>
<P>"Have you any children?</P>
<P>"I had, madam, one, a &s;weet girl:&mdash;but"&mdash;I could not proceed. I turned my face from her, and we both remained &s;ilent for &s;everal minutes.&mdash;</P>
<P>"I too," &s;aid the lady, &s;tarting as it were from a deep reverie. "I too, once had a child&mdash;a girl&mdash;nay, perhaps have &s;till; but for many! many! years, &s;he has been lo&s;t to me."</P>
<P>When we drew near to the end of our little journey, &s;he told me &s;he felt inclined to be my friend, and if I would do her the favour to call at her hou&s;e and point out the means, &s;he would readily exert her utmo&s;t abilities to alleviate the afflictions, which &s;eemed to pre&s;s &s;o heavily upon me. She then told me her name was Harcourt and wi&s;hed me a good morning.</P>
<P>Weak, oppre&s;&s;ed, dejected my trembling limbs being &s;carce able to &s;upport me, I &s;low|ly a&s;cended the &s;tairs, which led to the apart|ment occupied by Rook&s;by. The door was opened. I was ju&s;t entering, but a &s;ight met my eyes that almo&s;t annihilated me. It was

Rook&s;by &s;eated be&s;ide his infamous Clara, with tea and coffee on the table before them. From their own di&s;habille and the appearance of the room, I perceived they were but ju&s;t ri&s;en. I know not what I &s;aid in the fir&s;t moment of &s;urprize, but I remember cla&s;p|ing my forehead hard with both my hands and exclaiming, "grant me patience hea|ven." As I ran down &s;tairs, my brain &s;eemed whirling in perpetual motion and had I not been detained by one of the keepers of the pri&s;on I fear I &s;hould have ru&s;hed in|to the &s;treet in a &s;tate little &s;hort of in&s;anity.</P>
<P>The recollection of what I then &s;uffered is too much for my weak &s;pirits. I cannot proceed in my narrative. Adieu, my friend|ly Celia, I am now in a place of &s;afety and will, when I am able, inform you of every occurrence down to the pre&s;ent time. Hea|ven ble&s;s you.</P>

<P>I HARDLY dare take up my pen to write to the worthy On&s;low: for I have ren|dered my&s;elf totally unworty of his friend|&s;hip. Will you and your amiable Amelia believe it? No you will think it impo&s;&s;ible, that I&mdash;I, who &s;o often have &s;worn to pro|tect her, &s;hould act in &s;o thoughtle&s;s a man|ner as to drive the lovely Meriel from my hou&s;e. Yes, On&s;low, &s;he left my hou&s;e in the night, unattended and ru&s;hed into dan|gers, of which her delicate mind could form no idea; and my folly was the cau&s;e. I forgot what was due to her honour and my own, and dared to &s;olicit her to quit her hu&s;|band and remain with me. Oh! fool, madman that I was, when I knew the dig|nity of her mind, to think &s;he would &s;uffer &s;uch a thought to harbour in her bo&s;om for a moment. She once loved me;&mdash;yes, and

<P>The dear creature had recovered &s;o far as to be able to leave her apartment, when the conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which frightened her from the protection I had vainly hoped would have henceforth &s;helter|ed her from all the ills of life. She had &s;upped with me, and on retiring, wi&s;hed me a good night with a look and voice &s;o full of tenderne&s;s, that I longed to pre&s;s her to my heart: but I forbore and only ki&s;&s;ed her hand. Early the next morning, I was awakened by poor Deborah, who a&s;ked me if I knew where her lady was&mdash;for &s;he was not in her apartment, nor had the &s;ervant who &s;lept in her room &s;een her. Terrified, lea&s;t her unfortunate malady &s;hould have re|turned, I ha&s;tily aro&s;e and inquired of eve|ry per&s;on in the hou&s;e if they had &s;een her; but to no purpo&s;e.

Where could &s;he go? Her friends or rather tho&s;e who had once &s;tiled themelves &s;o, had all for&s;aken her in her misfortunes&mdash;to whom then could &s;he go?

I did not attempt to &s;ee Rook&s;|by, I could not have &s;poken to him with calmne&s;s.

Though I earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee the &s;uf|fering angel, her commands, her pathetic entreaties to me were &s;acred; I &s;ent for Deborah and giving her ten guineas bade her ha&s;ten to her mi&s;tre&s;s and to let me know when &s;he wanted more ca&s;h. The faithful old woman &s;obbed with joy when I told her that her lady was &s;afe; and left the room almo&s;t with the alacrity of a girl, when &s;he was told to follow the me&s;&s;enger who brought the letter.</P>
<P>The next morning, the money was return|ed in a &s;mall parcel, which I received and opened without knowing from whence it came. On the inner paper were the&s;e words. "Dear generous Kingly, I am already over|whelmed with obligations from you. Pardon me, I can receive no more." There was no name annexed; but I knew the dear characters had been traced by the hand of Meriel.&mdash;Re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till to &s;erve her, even again&s;t her inclination, I went to my agent and de&s;ired him to go to the bench, make inquiry for Deborah and pretend to pay &s;ome money that was owing to old Mr. Howard. But here I failed; for when my agent re|turned, he informed me that Mrs. Rook&s;by had been with her hu&s;band that &s;he remained only a &s;hort time and where &s;he was gone no one could tell. He al&s;o informed me
<PB N="101" REF="029439_0584_0FE11AD5CBA1FB48">
that Rook&s;by had a woman in the apartment with him, who had been thrown into pri&s;on about three weeks before by a Mercer, to whom &s;he was indebted upwards of a hundred pounds, and that both of them expected &s;oon to be relea&s;ed. From his de&s;cription of the woman's per&s;on, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it to be the infamous Clara; but think it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble, as I was informed &s;he was living at Bru&s;&s;els only a &s;hort time &s;ince in great &s;plendor with a man of the fir&s;t rank and for|tune. Should it prove &s;o, I &s;hall pronounce him a blacker villain than I ever thought him: and how like an angel will the villainy of the one and the ingratitude of the other make Meriel appear, who in the very mo|ment that &s;he was &s;o cruelly treated by them could recommend their children to my care. I will obey her, On&s;low. They &s;hall &s;hare the education of my own boys, and I make no doubt of being able to provide for them either in the army or navy.&mdash;</P>
<P>Every inquiry after Meriel is vain She has hid her&s;elf &s;o effectually as to elude the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch, I can no longer &s;tay in Eng|land I have &s;olicited employment in the We&s;t-Indies and &s;hall &s;oon &s;ail. I have commi&s;&s;ion|ed

<P>I BROKE off abruptly in my la&s;t, for I found my &s;pirits were unequal to the ta&s;k of retracing &s;cenes which had given me &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s. I informed you of my di&s;covery of Clara in the pri&s;on with Rook&s;by; but I am yet to inform you that when, by the humanity of one of the keep|ers, I was prevailed on to go into a room and endeavour to compo&s;e my&s;elf, I receiv|ed a verbal me&s;&s;age from my cruel tyrant, de&s;iring me to leave him to his fate and re|turn to my favourite Kingly, with whom he knew I had publicly lived for &s;everal weeks in defiance of &s;hame. A me&s;&s;age &s;o injurious, &s;o unju&s;t, rou&s;ed my re&s;entment, and I de|manded to &s;ee the cruel man, who could thus dare to in&s;ult me.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="029439_0587_0FE11AE429F397F0">
I once more a&s;cended the &s;tairs to his a|partment, and knocking at the door, entered with as much re&s;olution, as I could a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>He received me with a mixture of confu|&s;ion and contempt, and Clara, without deigning to ri&s;e from her &s;eat; gave a &s;light inclination of the head: but at that mo|ment I felt my&s;elf a wife, an innocent injur|ed wife! and re&s;entment conquered every other feeling!&mdash;</P>
<P>"Rook&s;by!" &s;aid I, &s;eating my&s;elf op|po&s;ite to him, and regarding him with a fixed attention, "I come to inquire by what action of my life, I have incurred the unju&s;t cen&s;ures you have thrown upon me, or in what I have forfeited my claim to your regard, &s;ince I have been your wife."</P>
<P>"By your vile connection with Belger, before you were my wife&mdash;and your &s;till more infamous intrigue with Kingly &s;ince!" &s;aid he, in a kind of hurried accent, as though con&s;cious he did not him&s;elf believe what he a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>"By all my hopes of future felicity, Rook&s;|by," I replied, "I am innocent of what you accu&s;e me, as was the infant I bore&mdash;and who, I tru&s;t, is now an angel in the

<P>"Poor Clementina," &s;aid he, ri&s;ing and coming toward me, I &s;hould have liked to have &s;een her once more, before &s;he was gone forever."</P>
<P>Clara, &s;aw &s;he was lo&s;ing ground; &s;o ri&s;ing in great ha&s;te, &s;he told him that when he had &s;ettled the difference that had been between us, perhaps, &s;he might look in and congra|tulate us; that content was a great ble&s;&s;ing, and a forgiving temper, a &s;ure &s;ign of a good chri&s;tian; that for her part, &s;he had good rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e both Mrs. Belger and Mrs. Kingly fell victims to my art, for their hearts were broken by their hu&s;bands, who&s;e affections I had exerted my&s;elf to obtain, and had effectually drawn from them."</P>
<P>"If," &s;aid I with more firmne&s;s than I believed my&s;elf capable of, "if every wo|man in the world was as free from the crime of &s;educing the affection of a hu&s;band from his wife as I am, it would be well for many. But, be not mi&s;taken, Clara, I come not to &s;ue to my hu&s;band, or endeavour to re|gain his heart, I am at length convinced I

never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and as it would have been happy for us, had we never met; I am de|termined that we will here part forever!!!"</P>
<P>"Forever, Meriel," &s;aid Rook&s;by, "leave me forever?"&mdash;</P>
<P>Clara's countenance brightened, and &s;he re&s;umed her &s;eat.</P>
<P>"I am well convinced, Rook&s;by," I re|plied, "that &s;o far from having it in my power to &s;erve or oblige you, my pre&s;ence is painful to you, and I am con&s;idered a burthen.&mdash;The pain, the burthen &s;hall therefore be removed."</P>
<P>"And you will return to Kingly?"</P>
<P>"No! Rook&s;by.&mdash;Here in the awful face of Heaven, I &s;wear, I never have, nor ever will di&s;honour the name of your rever|ed mother: a name, which at her reque&s;t I received from you. And, that Heaven is my witne&s;s, was the chearful di&s;charge of my duty a &s;ource of happine&s;s to you, as no power on earth &s;hould &s;eperate me from you!&mdash;I would remain with you in the mo&s;t abject di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;comfort you&mdash;nay, even labour for your &s;upport! but&mdash;as it is&mdash;we mu&s;t part!!!&mdash;I forgive

you from my &s;oul, every injury&mdash;not on|ly you! but, tho&s;e who have been the cau&s;e of your errors!&mdash;I will pray for your happine&s;s&mdash;and forget, if po&s;&s;ible&mdash;how cruelly and how often you have wronged me!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I am villain!" &s;aid he, ri&s;ing and &s;trik|ing his forehead with vehemence.</P>
<P>"Before we part Rook&s;by," cried I, lay|ing my hand on his arm, " I &s;olemnly con|jure you as the la&s;t and only reque&s;t I &s;hall ever make, &s;eek not to palliate your own faults by taxing me with guilt. I am con|&s;cious of my own innocence, and feel not the &s;harpne&s;s of the accu&s;ation; but it in|crea&s;es your own offences in the &s;ight of Heaven!&mdash;I forgive every thing that has pa&s;t&mdash;only, throw not an odium on my character, and I will ble&s;s you forever!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"You are, you mu&s;t be innocent," &s;aid he, "I believe you are pure as an angel. You are a trea&s;ure too great for me to po&s;&s;e&s;s. I have voluntarily thrown you from me, and though I know your worth, &s;ome &s;trange fatality ever pur&s;ues me, and the weakne&s;s of my nature hurries me to actions which I know are wrong."</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="029439_0591_0FE11AF7276192D0">
"Farewel!" &s;aid I, turning to leave the room.</P>
<P>"But whither are you going, Meriel, I fear you are in want. My affairs begin to wear a better a&s;pect. I have had a few thou|&s;ands left me by a relation. Let me know where to &s;end to you that you may &s;hare in my fortune, though I can never hope again to po&s;&s;e&s;s a place in your heart.&mdash;His voice faultered and he actually &s;hed tears. Celia, Rook&s;by is a man &s;o weak &s;o un&s;table in his nature that the impul&s;e of the moment ever hurries him away: and perhaps ju&s;t then he would have &s;ued for a reconciliation and had he been ma&s;ter of the world offered to divide it with me. And the fir&s;t moment Clara had an opportunity to exert her art, &s;he would have revived all his &s;u&s;picions and I &s;hould again been ill treated, vilified, nay, perhaps thru&s;t like an abandoned wretch from his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of this ver&s;atility of temper I wi&s;h|ed not to prolong our interview, be&s;ides I was faint and exhau&s;ted. The &s;pirits which re&s;ent|ment had rou&s;ed were now begining to &s;ub&s;ide and when I con&s;idered his errors and the weakne&s;s of his nature I only con&s;idered him as an object of compa&s;&s;ion. The pre&s;ence of Clara too was in&s;upportably painful, I,
<PB N="109" REF="029439_0592_0FE11AFC8E7B0FD0">
therefore, almo&s;t forcibly tore my&s;elf from him and hurring down &s;tairs immediately left the pri&s;on, and went to the lodgings I had occupied before.</P>
<P>The woman of the hou&s;e received me kindly. After I had taken &s;ome refre&s;hment I lay down and endeavoured to procure a little re&s;t; but the effort was ineffectual.&mdash;The &s;cenes I had been engaged in the pre|ceding night and day entirely occupied my thoughts; the idea of Kingly's &s;urprize and unea&s;ine&s;s when he &s;hould di&s;cover my hav|ing left him; the &s;orrow of my affectionate Deborah, my own forlorn &s;ituation, and dreary future pro&s;pect, all con&s;pired to bani&s;h from my eyes the balmy comfort of &s;leep. I aro&s;e, and procuring pens and paper, wrote a few lines to my hu&s;band informing him where I was, that he might not &s;ay I had prevented his a&s;&s;i&s;ting me by not letting him know where to &s;end. I al&s;o wrote to Kingly in a manner which I knew would effectually prevent his endeavouring to &s;ee me; but de&s;ired him to &s;end Deborah back with the per&s;on, who brought the letter.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the night in a very re&s;tle&s;s man|ner, and in the morning was unable to ri&s;e. A fever, want of appetite, and great la&s;&s;i|tude, hung upon me for above ten days.&mdash;
<PB N="110" REF="029439_0593_0FE11AFFD09E3A08">
Indeed, I thought I was going into a rapid dicline; but the care of Deborah, who nur|&s;ed me with ince&s;&s;ant tenderne&s;s, and part|ed even with &s;ome of her apparel to pro|cure me proper and nouri&s;hing food, re&s;tored me to &s;ome degree of my wonted &s;trength. During this time, I heard nothing from Rook&s;by: though perfectly &s;atisfied, that his fickle di&s;po&s;ition had operated as u&s;ual, and that no longer &s;een, I was no longer remembered, yet &s;omething prompted me to &s;end to the bench and inquire after him. Deborah was my me&s;&s;enger; &s;he returned and told me he had been relea&s;ed above a week. I then &s;ent to Le Sage; but without letting him &s;u&s;pect who made the inquiry, and learned that my hu&s;band, (Oh, Heavens! happy had I been, had he never borne that title!) had left England in company with Clara; for I particularly de&s;ired the per&s;on who inquired, to a&s;k, wherever he was, if he was alone.</P>
<P>It was now time to think of &s;ome means of &s;upport, Gratitude al&s;o required that I &s;hould call on the benevolent Mrs. Harcourt. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf as neat as the &s;canty &s;tate of my wardrobe would allow and repaired to her hou&s;e. At my approach, I &s;aw the &s;hutters of the upper part were clo&s;ed; my heart &s;unk; but yet I ventured to knock
<PB N="111" REF="029439_0594_0FE11B05850994D0">
at the door. A woman &s;ervant opened it. I inquired for Mrs. Harcourt. "She is at "Bath," replied the woman. "Has &s;he been ill then?"&mdash;"Yes, &s;he caught cold on the night her hou&s;e was robbed, which ad|ded to the fright, brought on the gout in her &s;tomach. She was taken ill the next evening and for &s;everal days was thought in great danger; but &s;he is now better, and ye&s;terday morning &s;et off for Bath."</P>
<P>I thanked the woman for her information and was going from the door, when who &s;hould I &s;ee cro&s;s the hall but Peggy. She &s;aw and in&s;tantly recollected me: an exclamation of joy and &s;urprize e&s;caped her and &s;he ran to the door to &s;peak to me. She informed me that Mrs. Harcourt had taken her into the hou&s;e as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the hou&s;ekeeper that the kind lady had mentioned me previous to her departure, and de&s;ired if I called I would leave word where I might be found. I told Peggy I was not &s;ettled in any place at pre&s;ent; but I would call again in the cour&s;e of a fortnight when I hoped to hear of Mrs Harcourt's perfect recovery.</P>
<P>On my return, I con&s;ulted with Deborah, what we could po&s;&s;ibly do to earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. The affectionate creature could think of nothing. She could only weep that I was
<PB N="112" REF="029439_0595_0FE11B0880173568">
obliged to have recour&s;e to work. After re|volving many various &s;chemes in my mind, I at length fixed on one, that I thought was fea&s;ible&mdash;It was to &s;end Deborah to the woman, who had formerly &s;upplied me with millinery, and to de&s;ire her to inquire in my name whether &s;he could give employment to a reputable young woman, who was in an ill &s;tate of health and only able to work at her own apartment. Deborah executed the com|mi&s;&s;ion faithfully and on her return told me &s;he had procured employment for me at a great warehou&s;e, where &s;he had been recom|mended by the per&s;on to whom I &s;ent her.</P>
<P>"But dear madam," &s;aid &s;he, the prices are &s;o very &s;mall, you will never be able to live on what you earn."&mdash;This did not deter me. I removed to a room near the warehou&s;e for which I was to work; that our time might not be taken up in going backwards and for|wards. Deborah procured the work and I executed it. I gave great &s;atisfaction and had as much as my&s;elf and Deborah could po&s;|&s;ibly do, yet with the mo&s;t indefatigable in|du&s;try, we could &s;carcely earn eighteen or twenty &s;hillings a week. The clo&s;e applica|tion to my employment did not agree with my health, and I was obliged to devote an hour every day to exerci&s;e, nor did even this an&s;wer the de&s;ired end, and I was in a &s;hort

time &s;o pale and thin that you would &s;carce|ly have believed me to have been the Meriel Howard you once knew. Ill as I was, I &s;till continued my employment as well as I was able; but weakne&s;s and fatigue often over|came me and I was obliged to give up hours to re&s;t, and &s;ometimes whole days</P>
<P>My weakne&s;s encrea&s;ed, and my income proportionally decrea&s;ed. I &s;aw famine ad|vancing with ha&s;ty &s;trides, and to add to my affliction I knew the affection of De|borah had involved her in my di&s;tre&s;&s;es. My lodging was in Oxford-&s;treet, and I &s;ome|times walked into the fields which are adja|cent to the pari&s;h of Bloom&s;bury. One day, as with &s;low uneven pace I took my accu&s;|tomed walk, ju&s;t as I had reached Gower|&s;treet, I &s;aw a &s;plendid equipage pa&s;s me and &s;top at a hou&s;e which &s;eemed newly fitted up. I cannot accouut for the curio&s;ity that &s;eized me; but I inquired of a man who had the appearance of a Butler; to whom the hou&s;e and carriage belonged.</P>
<P>"To Mr. Howard" &s;aid the man&mdash;Mr. Howard; what Howard?</P>
<P>"I don't know," he replied, "what his Chri&s;tian name is, but he is lately returned from India".&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="029439_0597_0FE11B11BB65A488">
A&s;toni&s;hment rendered me &s;ilent, and the man proceeded.&mdash;</P>
<P>"He came over about two months &s;ince, and took that hou&s;e. I then lived the next door and knew all that pa&s;&s;ed in the family. He brought a young lady over with him, who is very pretty; but &s;eems unhappy. She is very young indeed; and he is going to marry her; but I think it is again&s;t her inclination: for though I have heard the &s;er|vants &s;ay &s;he &s;eemed to re&s;pect him, &s;he of|ten declares &s;he can never love him.&mdash;</P>
<P>I mu&s;ed upon what the man had told me and was determined to inquire farther about this Mr. Howard. It might be my brother, and the &s;ums I had advanced it might now be in his power to return; not that I intended to a&s;k him for them but, methought, natu|ral affection would certainly operate in his bo&s;om in behalf of a &s;i&s;ter who had &s;hared all her property with him and was now bent to the earth with &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow.&mdash;On farther inquiry I learned that his name was Richard Howard. Determined to make at lea&s;t a trial of him, I learned at what hour it would be mo&s;t likely to &s;ee him, for as he was become a great man, I readily conceiv|ed my only being his &s;i&s;ter and in di&s;tre&s;s would but poorly plead my excu&s;e for going
<PB N="115" REF="029439_0598_0FE11B16D84F9260">
at an un&s;ea&s;onable time. Far be it from me, my dear Celia, to &s;ay this is the ca&s;e with all, there are &s;ome glorious ornaments of the creation who never turn from the cry of affliction, and who never con&s;ider it intru&s;ive; who&s;e hearts are ever open and who&s;e hands are ever ready to di&s;pen&s;e to tho&s;e who are in want, a part of tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings which a bounteous Providence has &s;howerd on them&s;elves:&mdash;but the thorough knowledge I have of the human heart led me to reflect, that when a per&s;on has unex|pectedly ri&s;en to opulence from ob&s;curity, his feelings grow callous he forgets and to|tally neglects tho&s;e branches of his family who, though perhaps they have been equal|ly indu&s;trious with him&s;elf, have not been equally the favourites of fortune.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock one morning, I knocked at Mr. Howard's door; and was reque&s;ted by the &s;ervant to &s;end up my name, I did &s;o, adding that I had particular bu&s;ine&s;s with him. After waiting about ten minutes (for I &s;uppo&s;e my dre&s;s had not prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the man in my favour.) I was told I might come up.&mdash;My limbs trembled as I entered the room. The fir&s;t glance convinced me it was my brother, though he is greatly in|crea&s;ed in bulk, being now a very &s;tout man, and when we parted he was but a &s;lender

lad, yet his features were the &s;ame. He was &s;itting at breakfa&s;t with a very young lady, who appeared dejected and unhappy. I ima|gined this to be the per&s;on of whom the &s;er|vant &s;poke.</P>
<P>He gave a &s;light inclination of the head as I entered, the &s;ervant brought forward a chair and left the room.</P>
<P>"Now madam," &s;aid the haughty ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, "what is your plea&s;ure?"</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid I, looking earne&s;tly at him, "that you can have no recollection of me?&mdash;</P>
<P>"Not the lea&s;t, I do not recollect that I ever &s;aw you before."</P>
<P>"You had once a &s;i&s;ter, &s;ir.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Yes I had, but &s;he was always a &s;trange eccentric girl; &s;he ran through a very good fortune, and I under&s;tand has di&s;graced her family in the mo&s;t &s;hocking maner."</P>
<P>"Brother," &s;aid I, emphatically, "and I felt my eyes gu&s;h out with tears.&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;at down the cup, which he was rai&s;ing to his lips, and with a look of mingled anger

and a&s;toni&s;hment, cried, "why &s;urely you can never be Meriel Howard."&mdash;</P>
<P>"I am your &s;i&s;ter, I am all that remains of Meriel Howard, but I no longer bear that name."&mdash;</P>
<P>"I was told you had a&s;&s;umed the name of a gentleman with whom you lived &s;ome years, but he has left you through your own folly."&mdash;</P>
<P>"And who could a&s;&s;ert &s;uch a fal&s;ehood, brother?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"My Aunt Mo&s;&s;op told me, and &s;o did He&s;ter, who is well married. Su&s;an wrote them word that you behaved in &s;uch a man|ner &s;ome few years &s;ince upon the continent, as occa&s;ioned the per&s;on you lived with to fight a duel on your account: that you &s;e|perated then and had never lived together &s;ince."</P>
<P>The &s;light, the cutting indifference of my brother, wounded me to the &s;oul. I was debilitated in mind and body, yet I could hardly re&s;train the fulne&s;s of my heart; be|ing unable to &s;upport the interview any longer, I aro&s;e to depart; for he had nei|ther a&s;ked me to eat or drink. The young

lady looked at me, and I &s;aw the tear of compa&s;&s;ion &s;tart in her eyes.</P>
<P>"I am very &s;orry, Meriel," &s;aid my bro|ther, "that you are in &s;uch indifferent circum&s;tances as your appearance &s;eems to be&s;peak, if a couple of guineas"</P>
<P>"No, &s;ir!" &s;aid I, putting back the hand extended with the money, if I am un|worthy to be received as your &s;i&s;ter, I am unworthy of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance: be&s;ides, bro|ther, I came in hopes to find an affection|ate relative, a friend, who&s;e heart would compa&s;&s;ionate my &s;ufferings. Di&s;appointed in that&mdash;I am too proud to accept a dona|tion from your bounty!"&mdash;"As you plea&s;e, madam!" bowing coldly, "had you con|ducted your&s;elf in a manner becoming my &s;i&s;ter"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Brother, had I come to your door in a &s;plendid equipage, perhaps, you would not have inquired &s;o &s;trictly into my conduct. In that ca&s;e even the errors of which I am now accu&s;ed, would have been overlooked; but poverty is a fault the opulent can &s;el|dom pardon. I am happy, brother, to &s;ee the advancement of your fortune; but, &s;hould you ever experience a rever&s;e, you will then di&s;cover, that tho&s;e who now ca|re&s;s

and flatter you, nay, even would creep into your favour by vilifying me, would be the fir&s;t to turn from you; and blame you for misfortunes you could neither avoid nor avert!"</P>
<P>"I &s;ee Meriel," &s;aid he, "with a &s;neer, "you at lea&s;t retain one &s;triking trait in your character, you are as good a preacher as ever."</P>
<P>"I will take care to retain every trait," I replied, "for which I have been re&s;pected. I have now lo&s;t the name of Howard, and can no longer di&s;grace it by my poverty; and I hope my affluent brother will never let that name be di&s;honoured by him."</P>
<P>I then bade him good morning, with|out being reque&s;ted to renew my vi&s;it. I was now &s;o accu&s;tomed to di&s;appointment that I felt not this behaviour of my brother &s;o &s;everely as I &s;hould have done &s;ome few years &s;ince. Indeed, my dear friend, I think my heart grows hard and in&s;en&s;ible, and &s;eems turning into &s;tone, for it is cold and inanimate. I can no longer exult in the happine&s;s, or &s;ympathize in the mi&s;eries of my fellow creatures. The world appears one univer&s;al blank, nay even when I think of you and my Amelia, it &s;till beats but lan|guidly,

its emotions are no longer exqui&s;itely plea&s;ant or painful, but like the faint rays of an expiring taper now and then emits a fla&s;h of light that for a moment chears the gloom of a &s;olitary apartment, and after a few &s;truggles is entirely extingui&s;hed. So my heart, which feels a degree of kindly warmth play round it, when I think of your affection, will perhaps a little longer &s;truggle to illumine this frail tenement; then &s;ink to peace in the dark man&s;ion of the grave.&mdash;But why &s;hould I infe&s;t you with my melan|choly? I fear I am an ungrateful wretch; for I have found a friend when I lea&s;t ex|pected it, and one who exerts his power to pre&s;erve a life that is no longer of value to me; becau&s;e it is entirely u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ociety. My poor Deborah too, &s;he is &s;till faithful and affectionate. I have &s;till much to be thankful for; but &s;uch is the frailty of hu|man nature, we remember our &s;orrows with a repining mind, while we forget the bene|fits of which we we are unworthy parta|kers.</P>

<P>MY dear friend, I have once more &s;et down to addre&s;s to you, to tell you I every day draw nearer and nearer the goal, to which we are all ha&s;tening, where I &s;hall again embrace my dear Clementina, and be parted from her no more!&mdash;I told you, in my la&s;t, that I had unexpectedly found a friend, who had u&s;ed his utmo&s;t en|deavours
<PB N="122" REF="029439_0605_0FE11B37C6766370">
to &s;erve me. It was Mr. Friend|ly, the gentleman to who&s;e care, my regret|ted benefactor, Mr. Weldon, &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly recommended me before he left England. I was one morning at the warehou&s;e, from whence I had employment, when he came in and with him a woman extremely gay in her appearance; but many years younger than him&s;elf. She was what might by many have been called pretty; but to me there appeared nothing in her features that could de&s;erve that name. It was an unmeaning countenance, devoid of &s;en&s;ibility, and if it had any character, it was that of pride and impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P>She purcha&s;ed &s;ome very expen&s;ive arti|cles, for which he &s;topped to pay, and &s;he went off in the chariot, to make, as &s;he &s;aid, &s;ome morning vi&s;its. From what I &s;aw, I feared the good old gentleman had entered the matrimonial pale with a per&s;on no ways qualified to make him happy; and the event proved I was not mi&s;taken in my conjectures. As I was &s;o greatly altered in per&s;on, as not to be recollected by a bro|ther, I could not &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Friendly would know me; but I was mi&s;taken; for as I was &s;peaking to the per&s;on who was giv|ing me out my work, he turned round ha&s;|tily
<PB N="123" REF="029439_0606_0FE11B3CE60110A0">
and looked at me as though endeavour|ing to recollect my features.</P>
<P>"There are but &s;mall remains of the per|&s;on," &s;aid he, coming toward me, "but I could almo&s;t &s;wear that was the voice of Mi&s;s Howard." You know, Celia, I have often been remarked for the &s;oftne&s;s of my voice, and I believe many, who would not otherwi&s;e recollect me, know me the mo|ment I &s;peak. I curt&s;yed, acknowledged he was right, and left the &s;hop. I had not proceeded many paces before he overtook me, and offering me his arm, with the &s;o|licitude of a father, inquired into my cir|cum&s;tances. He had heard I was well mar|ried, but nothing more; my pre&s;ent ap|pearance did not confirm the report; he wi&s;hed to know if he could &s;erve me. Be|fore I could &s;atisfy his laudable curio&s;ity, we had reached the door of the hou&s;e where I lived.</P>
<P>"I have an hour to &s;pare, &s;aid he, "may I be admitted, "I cannot leave you till I know how you are &s;ituated. I am perfect|ly acquainted with the goodne&s;s of your heart; but I know with all your virtues, you have weakne&s;&s;es more prejudicial to your intere&s;t and happine&s;s than &s;ome which are called vices. You are credulous; and
<PB N="124" REF="029439_0607_0FE11B41CDF935A0">
you let a &s;en&s;e of duty &s;ometimes hurry you to actions which are not &s;trictly right. Let me know how you are &s;ituated; tell me your&s;elf what has &s;eperated you from your hu&s;band."</P>
<P>Shall I confe&s;s, my dear Celia, &s;hame at the mean apartment I occupied, for a mo|ment crim&s;oned my cheek; and made me he&s;itate to admit him up &s;tairs; but grati|tude for the kind &s;olicitude he expre&s;&s;ed, a reverential remembrance of the noble &s;pirit|ed Weldon, who&s;e friend he was: con&s;pi|red to conquer this un&s;ea&s;onable emotion of pride, and I led the way to my little garret, (for &s;uch it literally is.) Deborah looked &s;urpri&s;ed at my introducing a man into an apartment, which con&s;tituted our dining room, drawing room, bed chamber, and kitchen. But when &s;he heard me mention Mr. Weldon, who&s;e name &s;he knew I re|&s;pected, and who&s;e friends I &s;hould ever con&s;ider as mine, &s;he was perfectly &s;atisfied; and when &s;he found the good old gentleman meant to prove his friend&s;hip to Weldon, by his attention to me, I thought &s;he would have gone wild with joy. She drew a chair clo&s;e to his, nor could all my endeavours to the contrary, prevent her informing him of all &s;he knew, concerning Rook&s;by; and when &s;he mentioned my drawing my &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="125" REF="029439_0608_0FE11B46ECFB2EB8">
from labour, and my evident ill &s;tate of health; &s;he took his hand and pre&s;&s;ed it to her heart; while the tears rolled in big drops down her aged face. I could not &s;ee her emotions unmoved: I aro&s;e from my &s;eat and pretended to look after the dinner, which Deborah, from her friendly anxiety to promote my intere&s;t, had totally neglect|ed; and un&s;een, gave a loo&s;e to &s;en&s;ations which almo&s;t overpowered me.</P>
<P>Mr. Friendly would not leave me, till he had prevailed with me to give up my em|ployment, to leave the place I then inhabi|ted, and go to apartments, which he would provide a little way out of town.&mdash;"You &s;hall not be obliged," &s;aid he, "for I know that is what would mo&s;t afflict your proud &s;pirit. You think you are humble," (added he with a &s;mile) "but I know you better. You ever was and ever will be very proud: but I like you the better for it. It is the right &s;ort of pride; it is a pride, which &s;hrinks from the weight of obligation which it has not power to return.&mdash;Now to obviate that, you have it in your power to oblige me. I have taken a young creature under my protection, (for I am quite a knight er|rant in the cau&s;e of the ladies,) &s;he is, I be|lieve, a girl of good fortune, and &s;trictly virtuous, but very unfortunate. Now if
<PB N="126" REF="029439_0609_0FE11B4B8C2B7E68">
you will take her for your companion and teach her, as I know you po&s;&s;e&s;s abilities, how to amu&s;e at once her time and enrich her mind, I will &s;upply you with the means. Some other time you may learn how I came to take her under my care. Perhaps, &s;he her&s;elf, when &s;he perceives the gentlene&s;s of your nature, will confide more to you, than from the difference of our &s;ex &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could to me.</P>
<P>As to the means of your &s;upport, I have &s;ome connections, in the i&s;land of St. John's in America, who &s;end to me for thick cloaks, &amp;c. fit for the climate; now it &s;trikes me that you might make tho&s;e garments, at a good profit for your&s;elf, and yet leave a &s;ufficient for me."</P>
<P>When I &s;ound, he did not wi&s;h me to re|ceive obligations from him, without &s;ome means to repay them, I was willing to li&s;|ten to his plan, and in le&s;s than ten days from the time I fir&s;t &s;aw him, I was remov|ed to apartments in I&s;lington, where he &s;ent the young lady to me, whom he had taken under his protection. It was evening when &s;he arrived; I was ill, I was fatigued&mdash;had retired to bed and &s;aw her not till the next morning. Oh! Celia, I am very ill now&mdash;my head is giddy&mdash;I can proceed no farther

&mdash;perhaps I may never re&s;ume the pen.&mdash;Let me tell you then, while I have power. This lovely girl is&mdash;I can no more&mdash;all is dark&mdash;and&mdash;</P>
<P>It was only a faintne&s;s. I am very &s;ubject to them lately,&mdash;I am &s;omething better to|day and will, while Deborah permits me, pur&s;ue my narrative.</P>
<P>The young lady intru&s;ted to my care is the per&s;on whom I &s;aw at my brother's; and who, to avoid an union with him, has left his protection for that of a &s;tranger's. She tells me her name is Alton: that &s;he was born in England, but went over to India whil&s;t an infant; that her mother being obliged to go with a lady up into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> left her with a friend, who before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mother's return was forced to retire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> ravages of war: The friend to who&s;e care &s;he was intru&s;ted had no child of her own and at her death left her heire&s;s to a very hand&s;ome fortune; the gentleman, who was executor to the will, and guardian to Mi&s;s Alton intru&s;ted her to the care of my bro|ther that &s;he might be brought home to fi|ni&s;h her education. Struck with her per&s;on and the more powerful charms of twenty thou&s;and pounds, he has left no means un|tried,

by which he could hope to win her affection and draw her into a marriage; but &s;he has ever regarded him, as &s;he &s;ays, with more horror than any other &s;en&s;ations, when &s;he has con&s;idered him as a man de&s;igned to be her hu&s;band. He was extremely kind and attentive to her, and in return, &s;he re&s;|pected him and would do any thing to pro|mote his happine&s;s, except &s;acrifice her own. She knew &s;o little of the world, that &s;he had actually formed a &s;cheme of working for her bread, and did not even think &s;he could oblige my brother to do her ju&s;tice or place her at a proper &s;chool, and pay the &s;um her guardian allowed both for her education and pocket.

<P>SINCE my lady di&s;patched her la&s;t letter to you, &s;he has been daily declining and the faintings &s;he mentioned encrea&s;ed in a mo&s;t alarming manner. Mr. Friendly did every thing in his power to make her com|fortable, and the young lady he placed with her was very affectionate and tender; at one time I was in hopes &s;he would recover. But a circum&s;tance happened, that affected her &s;pirits &s;o much as to make the phy&s;icians think it nece&s;&s;ary to hurry her to this place for the benefit of the waters. Mr. Friendly generally called on her about twice a week, and though to prevail on my dear lady, to accept a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, he frequently talked and con&s;ulted her about work; yet
<PB N="130" REF="029439_0613_0FE11B5E668ADA10">
he never &s;ent any to do, always making &s;ome|excu&s;e about its not being ready. He was, however, fond of talking to her and &s;ome|times he would bring the new&s;paper and read to her, and whenever he gave her mo|ney &s;aid it was for the board of Mi&s;s Alton. It was one afternoon about &s;ix weeks ago, as he &s;at at tea with the two ladies, a cha|riot &s;topped at the door, a very fine lady came out of it, and without any ceremony threw open the dining room door, where they were all &s;itting: and flying at my dear lady abu&s;ed her in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner, accu&s;ed her of being kept by her hu&s;band; for I pre&s;ently found, madam, that this dreadful|ly pa&s;&s;ionate lady was Mrs. Friendly, who had traced her hu&s;band to the place where he &s;o often vi&s;ited, and finding only two women there, &s;he immediately thought one of them mu&s;t be her hu&s;band's mi&s;tre&s;s, and though my poor dear lady was &s;o ill as might, one would have thought, prevented any &s;uch &s;u&s;picion from being believed, yet did &s;he in&s;i&s;t upon it. Mr. Friendly, &s;he &s;aid could maintain her there for no other pur|po&s;e. She called her every vile name, broke the china and was only withheld by her hu&s;|band from &s;triking the innocent object of her jealou&s;y, who &s;at as it were &s;tupified with terror, her hands were cla&s;ped and re&s;ted on her knees and her eyes were fixed on the
<PB N="131" REF="029439_0614_0FE11B63AA6D2908">
floor; but &s;he &s;poke not one word. Mr. Friendly endeavoured to prevail on his wife to go home; but &s;he was deaf to his entrea|ties, till he promi&s;ed to accompany her. Ju&s;t as &s;he was going out, &s;he turned round and wi&s;hed my lady might &s;tarve and die in pri|&s;on, if ever &s;he encouraged her hu&s;band to come there again. "I &s;hould like to &s;ee it," &s;aid &s;he, "and if I &s;aw you dying, I would not give you a farthing to &s;ave you. You have had enough from my poor, credulous, fooli&s;h hu&s;band already and I hope the next bit of bread you eat that is bought with his money will choak you."</P>
<P>I do &s;uppo&s;e, madam, &s;he would have gone on much longer, if her hu&s;band had not al|mo&s;t forced her into the carriage, which drove in&s;tantly away. When they were gone, my dear lady rai&s;ed her eyes and cla&s;ped hands to Heaven, "for what new trials am I re&s;erved!" &s;aid &s;he, "Poor Mi&s;s Alton was crying ready to break her heart, and I &s;hould have been very glad to &s;ee my poor mi&s;tre&s;s do the &s;ame: but &s;he did not &s;hed a &s;ingle tear. She looked the very pic|ture of uncomplaining &s;orrow. I was fright|ened to &s;ee her look &s;o compo&s;ed, and as I feared, her faintings which had kept off for a few days before, now returned with dou|ble violence.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="029439_0615_0FE11B67241899C0">
The next day, a gentleman came from Mr. Friendly, &s;aying, that for family rea|&s;ons, he could not vi&s;it her; but de&s;ired &s;he might want for nothing. This gentleman waited, till the Doctor vi&s;ited my lady, and when he heard his opinion, that Bri&s;tol might be of &s;ervice to her, he de&s;ired me to make in&s;tant preparations for the journey. I chearfully complied, as I found not only the people, who kept the hou&s;e, where we lodged, but even the neighbours, had learned &s;omething of the vi&s;it of Mrs. Friendly, and both my lady and Mi&s;s Alton were con&s;ider|ed as bad women.</P>
<P>We travelled here by ea&s;y &s;tages, my lady was greatly fatigued, and for many days I did not expect her to live. The place re|vived in her mind the lo&s;s of her God|mother, who died here about &s;ixteen years ago, when my lady fir&s;t left the con|vent. The phy&s;icians here, comfort me, by &s;aying, they do not think &s;he is in a con|firmed con&s;umption; but that her di&s;order is chiefly on her &s;pirits, and could that de|pre&s;&s;ion under which &s;he evidently labours be removed, &s;he might yet recover, and would undoubtedly, in a rapid manner. Though I fear, madam, &s;he will never lo&s;e that depre&s;&s;ion; yet I cannot but flatter my|&s;elf &s;omething may yet turn out to comfort
<PB N="133" REF="029439_0616_0FE11B6CE546E860">
her. Surely it were a great pity &s;o good a lady &s;hould be cut off in the very flower of her age, and that &s;he, who never wilful|ly gave pain to any per&s;on, &s;hould be dy|ing of a broken heart. Indeed, madam it almo&s;t breaks my old heart to think of it.</P>
<P>She is &s;ome days &s;o well, as to be able to walk to the pump room; but &s;he has her|&s;elf no idea, that &s;he &s;hall ever leave this place. She is perfectly re&s;igned. She de|&s;ired me to write to you and to tell you, &s;he thinks &s;he &s;hall never be able to write her|&s;elf again. She offers you every kind wi&s;h and bids you pray for her everla&s;ting peace. Tho&s;e are her own words. One thing I was de&s;ired not to mention; but I cannot con|clude without doing it. I have written twice to Mr. Friendly, &s;ince we have been here: but received no an&s;wer. Our money is al|mo&s;t gone, and &s;hould he for&s;ake us, what will become of my dear lady and poor Mi&s;s Alton, God knows; as for my&s;elf, I am old, and could not hope to live much lon|ger; but for them, they have but ju&s;t en|tered the world as it were. Pardon me, madam, for writing &s;o much; but I am ve|ry unea&s;y and have no one to complain to or advi&s;e with. My lady &s;aid to me ye&s;ter|day, "Deborah, I think I am better: we will di&s;mi&s;s the phy&s;ician to-morrow." Poor

But now &s;he is broken hearted, for&s;aken by the world and with all her virtues will die unpitied and un|lamented by all, except a few, who know how good &s;he is; and among which, none will grieve with more &s;incerity than her and your humble friend and &s;ervant,</P>

<P>STRANGE and in&s;crutable are the ways of Heaven. Once more, my dear Ce|lia, I am permitted to addre&s;s you, and I have a tale of wonder to unfold, which even at this moment, though I am &s;en&s;ible that I live, I breathe, that all around me is re|ality, yet, my a&s;toni&s;hed &s;en&s;es can hardly credit!&mdash;Celia, the heavie&s;t afflictions may lead to the mo&s;t de&s;irable events. We ought not to complain: every trial, howe|ver painful to be borne is inflicted for &s;ome wi&s;e purpo&s;e. Gracious Heaven! when I think, how I have nouri&s;hed one &s;ecret &s;or|row; how even in my happie&s;t moments have I brooded over it? but it is now re|moved. That horror, that inexpre&s;&s;ible horror, which for &s;o many years has laid upon my mind, is no more. I have been afflicted 'tis true: but I tru&s;t I am now &s;afe at lea&s;t from poverty. My health daily returns,
<PB N="136" REF="029439_0619_0FE11B7B8FDDEB90">
and I can enjoy the heart-felt plea&s;ure of relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. But how, you will &s;ay, how have the&s;e changes taken place? My dear friend, when the tumult of my heart will permit me, I will tell you that I am no longer the friendle&s;s, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed crea|ture, I was not long &s;ince. I have a mo|ther living! I have a father too! Ble&s;&s;ed! ble&s;&s;ed words! and tho&s;e whom I ever con|&s;idered as my parents were only relations. Mrs. Howard was &s;i&s;ter to my mother.&mdash;But let me tell my tale with &s;ome coherence: for I think my Celia will imagine me wan|dering from rea&s;on, and that I am writing her the effu&s;ions of a di&s;tempered fancy.</P>
<P>While I was at Bri&s;tol, as long as I was able, I went every morning to the pump room. Mi&s;s Alton always accompanied me. I there had &s;everal times an opportunity of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with Mrs. Harcourt, who was detained there by the ill &s;tate of her hu&s;band's health, who I found was at Bath at the time I fir&s;t &s;aw her, which was the occca&s;ion of her attending the exami|nation of the per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of robbing her hou&s;e. She frequently made me offers of friend&s;hip, at the &s;ame time entreating my confidence: but my &s;pirits were not at that time, in a &s;tate to permit me to relate the incidents of my life, mo&s;t of which had
<PB N="137" REF="029439_0620_0FE11B80AB0755C8">
been &s;o extremely painful, that I endeavour|ed as much as was in my power to bani&s;h them from my memory.</P>
<P>Mr. Friendly, from family rea&s;ons, I ima|gine was deterred from inquiring for me, after I left London, and the allowance he had made me on account of Mi&s;s Alton's being with me, till he could hear from her friends abroad, entirely cea&s;ed when we had been about a month in Bri&s;tol, &s;o that I be|came again in very nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tan|ces, which added to my having declined the attendance of the phy&s;ician, and omitted going to drink the waters, on account of my &s;lender finances, encrea&s;ed my di&s;order and I &s;oon was confined to my bed. Mi&s;s Alton is a tender and affectionate girl and would have confined her&s;elf to my bed&s;ide, had I not in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;he &s;hould &s;ometimes walk out. In one of the&s;e walks &s;he met Mrs. Harcourt, who inquired after me.&mdash;The friendly girl expecting every hour to lo&s;e me, bur&s;t into tears at the que&s;tion, de|&s;cribed my &s;ituation to Mrs. Harcourt and entreated her to come and &s;ee me. Her own humanity impelled her to comply, and that very afternoon &s;he came to my apartment. She &s;eated her&s;elf by my bed&s;ide, took my hand, and was beginning to &s;peak; when Deborah entered the room with &s;ome toa&s;t
<PB N="138" REF="029439_0621_0FE11B8554624EB8">
and water which &s;he had been down &s;tairs to procure. Mrs. Harcourt &s;tarted. The gla&s;s fell from Deborah's hand; for their eyes met in the &s;ame moment. "Good gracious!" &s;aid Deborah, "am I awake&mdash;are you!&mdash;no,&mdash;it can't be!&mdash;I thought&mdash;but 'tis impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>Mrs. Harcourt had a little recovered her|&s;elf. "Yes, Deborah, &s;aid &s;he, "it is po&s;&s;i|ble. I am alive &s;till, though &s;o many years thought dead.&mdash;But tell me&mdash;I almo&s;t fear to a&s;k&mdash;yet tell me, where is my child?</P>
<P>Deborah came near. She took my hand and put it into Mrs. Harcourt's, pre&s;&s;ed them together, but remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Oh! gracious heaven!" &s;he exclaimed, "and is it indeed &s;o?" Then falling on the bed, and throwing her arms round me, &s;he cried, "my child! My darling child! have I found you then, only to lo&s;e you?"&mdash;Full of a&s;toni&s;hment and wonder, I could &s;carce|ly a&s;k the meaning of what I heard and &s;aw. "How madam," &s;aid I, "can I be your child? Alas! my dear mother has been ma|ny years in the &s;ilent grave."&mdash;"You have heard her mention a &s;i&s;ter &s;he once had?"</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="029439_0622_0FE11B8A86ADA3F8">
"Yes, but I always under&s;tood &s;he was dead before I was born."&mdash;"Dead to the world I was," &s;he replied, "for many years, and from a few weeks after your birth, my &s;i&s;ter never heard from me. Many vi|ci&s;&s;itudes have I experienced, far from Eng|land, unable to hear from you, and above ten years in captivity. When I again &s;aw my native land and made inquiry for my child and &s;i&s;ter, I was told they were both dead: Nor did I ever think to have been &s;o ble&s;t as this; but I mu&s;t inquire my beloved Meriel, when you are able to an&s;wer me. I mu&s;t know how you have been &s;o long hid from me, and why it was reported you were dead. Are my brother and &s;i&s;ter Howard both dead?"&mdash;</P>
<P>She might have proceeded in her que&s;|tions uninterrupted; for a&s;toni&s;hment had deprived me of the power of &s;peech. Yet perfectly conceiving in a moment the ex|treme felicity of having a mother! a mother who loved me, my heart al&s;o felt lightened of a load of angui&s;h. He, who had at|tempted my &s;eduction was not my father, he was no relation, only by marriage. Ce|lia, my beloved Celia, cannot you perfectly comprehend the rapture that thought con|veyed to my &s;oul. Oh! my friend&mdash;I am certain, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible: for you are
<PB N="140" REF="029439_0623_0FE11B8E32E17F58">
unacquainted with guilt. The very idea of it in&s;pires you with horror; then, what mu&s;t have been my feelings on the reflection, that I had kindled a guilty pa&s;&s;ion, from which nature &s;hrinks back agha&s;t!&mdash;But human nature, with all its frailties, could never &s;ink into &s;uch depravity.&mdash;Unable to ar|ticulate a &s;ingle word, I threw my arms round her neck and overpowered by the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations that ru&s;hed over my heart, I &s;unk into in&s;en&s;ibility. How long I remained &s;o, I cannot even conjecture; but when I recovered, I &s;eemed as though awaking from a deep &s;leep, and was full of the idea of a delightful dream.&mdash;How charmingly was that dream realized, when putting back the curtain I &s;aw my mother! my kind affectionate mother, &s;itting by my bed&s;ide.&mdash;"How are you, my child," &s;aid &s;he, in an accent of the &s;ofte&s;t maternal kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I was extremely faint, and could &s;carcely an&s;wer, but yet I felt better and I told her &s;o. From that hour I began to amend, and was in the cour&s;e of a few days able to be removed to my mother's hou&s;e, where I was introduced to my father. Oh! ble&s;&s;ed thought, that I &s;hould live to &s;ay I have a father!&mdash;a noble! honourable! father!&mdash;who&s;e every action of his life, is an eulogium

on the goodne&s;s of his heart; reflects a credit on the nation of which he is a native, and the religion of which he is not only a profe&s;&s;or, but a &s;trict follower of its pre|cepts.</P>
<P>When I was taken from the lodgings which I then occupied, to my dear mother's hou&s;e, a new &s;ource of a&s;toni&s;hment pre|&s;ented it&s;elf. My mother had a per&s;on with her, whom I had often heard her mention as an e&s;teemed friend and companion. The day after I was &s;ettled in her family, I was introduced to this lady and di&s;covered in her, tho' greatly altered the per&s;on of Mrs. Talbot, whom you may remember Mr. Howard kept in a very unbecoming manner, even in the hou&s;e with his wife, my dear, though &s;o ri|gid aunt.</P>
<P>She went abroad with a lady, who was following a hu&s;band, whom &s;he loved, and who, from nece&s;&s;ity, being an officer in the army, had been &s;eparated from her. When Mrs. Talbot left Woodbine-cott, &s;he did not know her own &s;ituation; but about &s;ix months after, &s;he became the mother of a girl. This girl &s;he left in the care of a Mrs. Alton, while &s;he her&s;elf accompanied her la|dy up the country in &s;earch of her hu&s;band. A variety of incidents, unnece&s;&s;ary here to

relate, detained them &s;everal years from the place where &s;he left her child. On her re|turn, neither friend nor child were to be found. Celia, do you not already know that this child is the very Mi&s;s Alton, whom my brother, as I have been accu&s;tomed to call him, would have married. My &s;oul &s;hudders, when I think of the e&s;cape he has had. This Mi&s;s Alton, is his &s;i&s;ter, the na|tural daughter of his father. Good Hea|vens! to what &s;ins are mortals led, as it were blindfold; by the vices of their pa|rents. The meeting between the mother and the daughter was very affecting. Mrs. Talbot has retained tho&s;e good re&s;olutions, with which &s;he has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay I fir&s;t in&s;pired her. She lo&s;t the friend whom &s;he accompanied to India, when &s;he had been there about &s;ix years, and was &s;oon after re|commended to the notice of that excellent woman, whom I have now the honour to call mother! with whom &s;he has continu|ed ever &s;ince, as a companion, a friend, and the &s;uperintendent of her family.</P>
<P>When I am more compo&s;ed, and my &s;trength will better permit me, I will give you a few particulars of the life of this dear, this new found parent; but at pre&s;ent, I am not permitted to devote above an hour out of the four and twenty to writing, and this letter

<P>IN my la&s;t, I promi&s;ed a few of the par|ticulars of my mother's life, and I will now give them without further preface.</P>
<P>She was &s;everal years younger than Mrs. Howard; and when her &s;i&s;ter was married, was &s;till at &s;chool. At the early age of &s;ixteen, &s;he became acquainted with Mr. Harcourt, the
<PB N="144" REF="029439_0627_0FE11BA0010A9230">
only &s;on of a wealthy Ea&s;t-India merchant, with whom &s;he entered into the mo&s;t &s;acred bonds before any part of either family even &s;u&s;pected there was an intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them. Her father died &s;oon after this union had taken place, died uninform|ed of it&mdash;and her mother followed him be|fore &s;he had an opportunity to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecret of her &s;ituation: for Mr. Harcourt dreaded the anger of his family, &s;hould they di&s;cover that he had married a woman with &s;o &s;mall a fortune as two thou&s;and pounds. My aunt Howard, whom I &s;o long con&s;ider|ed as my parent, was then &s;ettled, and was the only friend my mother had, to whom &s;he dared impart her marriage, and to this di&s;clo&s;ure &s;he was driven by nece&s;&s;ity; for &s;he found her&s;elf likely to become a mother. Mr. Howard was at that time on a vi&s;it to a friend &s;ome hundred miles from Woodbine cott, and my aunt offered her &s;i&s;ter an a&s;ylum, there, till &s;he &s;hould be relea&s;ed from her bur|then. It was there I was born, and on the very day of my birth intru&s;ted to the care of the faithful Deborah, who had been brought up by my grandmother and married from her hou&s;e. She &s;olemnly vowed never to divulge the &s;ecret of my birth; and when three weeks after, my aunt Howard was de|livered of a child, who expired in a few days, it was determined that &s;he &s;hould adopt
<PB N="145" REF="029439_0628_0FE11BA5C3EB99E0">
me and ever take care of me as her own, till it &s;hould be in the power of my parents to claim and acknowledge me.&mdash;Deborah alone, was privy to the impo&s;ture, and wor|thy has &s;he proved her&s;elf of the confidence placed in her. My father's friends having cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect he had formed &s;ome attach|ment, which did not altogether coincide with the plans they had formed for his fu|ture e&s;tabli&s;hment in life, had &s;ent him off on a commercial plan to Bengal, whil&s;t my mother was lying in. Di&s;tracted by this in|telligence, as &s;oon as her &s;trength permit|ted, &s;he re&s;olved to follow him; and leav|ing me in the care of Mrs. Howard, &s;he embarked for India; but on her arrival at Bengal learnt that her hu&s;band had execu|ted his commi&s;&s;ions at that place, and was gone with &s;ome Engli&s;h factors up the coun|try: impelled by a pure and ardent affec|tion, &s;he followed the route he had taken, but in vain. War began to advance with horrid &s;trides, followed by deva&s;tation and famine, and whil&s;t &s;earching for her hu&s;|band, my mother fell into the hands of the enemy. Lovely in her per&s;on, ornamented with all the charms of youth, &s;he was con|&s;idered as a valuable prize among the cap|tives, and was &s;old to a merchant, who pur|cha&s;ed &s;laves for the Grand Segnior. By long and tire&s;ome journies &s;he reached Con|&s;tantinople
<PB N="146" REF="029439_0629_0FE11BA9C1FC9B20">
and was pre&s;ented to the royal Turk, but fortunately her per&s;on did not plea&s;e him, and &s;he was only purcha&s;ed, merely to fill up the number of his wives; without once receiving a vi&s;it from him, or being &s;olicited to entertain him in an impro|per manner. Ten years was &s;he detained in this place, where &s;he &s;ays her time would have pa&s;t plea&s;antly enough, had it not been for the remembrance of my father and my|&s;elf; but the thought of what might have become of us, prevented her being happy or receiving the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction from the va|rious &s;cenes of luxury and amu&s;ement that daily &s;urrounded her. In the &s;ummer &s;ea|&s;on, the Grand Segnior &s;ent his wives and all the female part of his family in large parties to the different hou&s;es he had in the country: and in one of the&s;e excur&s;ions my mother was &s;truck with the appearance of a &s;lave, who u&s;ed to walk on a terrace before the windows of the apartments appointed for the women, apparently in a very ill &s;tate of health. In the party of woman of which my mother made one was a beautiful tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> who was &s;i&s;ter to the Grand Signior, her name was Zayde. She had ever &s;hewn a vi|&s;ible partiality to my mother, and cultiva|ted her friend&s;hip with the utmo&s;t care. She endeavoured to attain from her in&s;tructions &s;ome knowledge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Engli&s;h language,
<PB N="147" REF="029439_0630_0FE11BAF5045AA28">
and li&s;tened with attention, when &s;he &s;trove to in&s;truct her in the precepts of the Chri&s;|tian religion.</P>
<P>This young prince&s;s perceiving one day, that my mother regarded the &s;ick &s;lave with fixed attention, took an opportunity to tell her, the &s;lave was hers, that he was a fa|vourite, and had made an impre&s;&s;ion on her heart.</P>
<P>"I love him," &s;aid &s;he, "but I have never told him &s;o. I only endeavour to make his &s;ervitude le&s;s painful by &s;hewing him every kindne&s;s in my power; but when|ever I tell him I am &s;orry to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him &s;o un|happy, and wi&s;h I could remove the cau&s;e of his affliction, he an&s;wers, that his &s;or|rows can never be le&s;s, till he is re&s;tored to liberty and the love of a beautiful Chri&s;tian, who alone can render either life or liberty de&s;irable." "Thus much," continued &s;he, I can under&s;tand; but as I cannot ful|ly comprehend his meaning, I wi&s;h you would &s;ee and talk to him &s;ome evening, when, if you can learn from him, what will be mo&s;t conducive to his happine&s;s, I will exert my utmo&s;t power to procure it for him."&mdash;My mother complied with the re|que&s;t of Zayde, and one evening in the mid|dle of July &s;he accompanied her into the gar|den
<PB N="148" REF="029439_0631_0FE11BB3F32E8DE8">

<P>The moon was at the full&mdash;but the atmo&s;|phere was cloudy, and though it was po&s;&s;i|ble to di&s;tingui&s;h objects, yet the light was not &s;ufficient to permit a di&s;crimination of features.</P>
<P>She addre&s;&s;ed the &s;lave in Engli&s;h, told him how much Zayde was intere&s;ted in his behalf, and begged to learn from him, what could be done to comfort his mind, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the re&s;toration of his health.</P>
<P>"I might &s;ay," replied the &s;lave, "that liberty would re&s;tore me to all I &s;o feeling|ly regret&mdash;but, alas! lady, I have lo&s;t what it is not (I greatly fear) in the power of fate to re&s;tore.&mdash;Married in early youth to a lovely woman, who, to the charms of an engaging per&s;on, added all the fa&s;cina|ting beauties of a pure and elevated mind, and &s;eparated from her in the very moment when the delicacy of her &s;ituation mo&s;t re|quired a hu&s;band's tenderne&s;s and fond &s;olici|tude, think what I mu&s;t &s;uffer from an ab&s;ence of eleven years, without having once heard whether either her&s;elf or child are living.

above every other earthly con&s;ideration&mdash;thrown by the chance of war into a &s;lavery, from whence I can never hope to e&s;cape; I am, I feel am, lo&s;t to the world and dead to every thing but a remembrance of what I have been and what I now am."</P>
<P>"Alas! it is very &s;ad," replied my mo|ther, bending forward to wipe off the tears &s;he felt trickling from her eyes.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then the moon broke from the cloud that had ob&s;cured her brightne&s;s and &s;hed her beams full on the face of the per&s;on with whom &s;he was conver&s;ing. A &s;cream of mingled &s;urpri&s;e and joy e&s;caped her.&mdash;It was her hu&s;band, who under the &s;ame ma&s;ter, for the &s;ame term of years had en|dured &s;lavery, and yet no lucky chance had ever brought them together. Nay, even when &s;he had ob&s;erved him on the terrace, his vi&s;age was ever bent toward the earth, and his hat pulled over his eyes, and &s;he had no opportunity to di&s;cover features, which however altered by &s;ickne&s;s and &s;or|row were &s;till fre&s;h in her memory, &s;till dear to her heart.</P>
<P>They candidly revealed their &s;ituation to the generous Zayde, who was indefatigable till &s;he had contrived the means for their e&s;|cape.&mdash;
<PB N="150" REF="029439_0633_0FE11BBBCB6C7040">
"And will not you accompany us," &s;aid my mother, when &s;he informed her of the plan &s;he had laid, and gave into their hands the means of putting it in execu|tion.</P>
<P>"No," &s;he replied, "you my dear friend have taught me the foundation of the Chri&s;|tian religion; it teaches us to compa&s;&s;ionate and relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our fellow crea|tures; but it al&s;o teaches us never to for&s;ake our parents. I have a mother living, who is old. She &s;ays, I am her only comfort.&mdash;It will be wrong to leave her, to deprive her of what con&s;titutes her whole felicity. Go then, my friends, embrace this oppor|tunity of emancipating your&s;elves from &s;lavery: leave me to the performance of my duty: and pray for me, that though I do not, perhaps, pur&s;ue the right Chri&s;tian mode of wor&s;hip, yet, that the offerings of a &s;incere and grateful heart may be accepted at the throne of mercy."&mdash;</P>
<P>With eyes and hearts overflowing with gratitude and affection did my parents take leave of this fair benevolent Mahometan; but though they regained their liberty, vari|ous incidents prevented their return to Eng|land, till within the&s;e four years la&s;t pa&s;t. They had frequently written to inquire after

<P>Mr. Harcourt found that his own family, except &s;ome di&s;tant branches, were entirely extinct, and that a large fortune waited only his appearance and proper claim. This he is now ma&s;ter of, and to this I am now the acknowledged heire&s;s. Care&s;&s;ed by my pa|rents, re&s;pected once more by the world, who now again behold me &s;urrounded by affluence, my health and &s;pirits daily re|turning, what have I more to wi&s;h for?&mdash;Alas! Celia, we are never content, and I mo&s;t ardently de&s;ire my poor Rook&s;by's re|formation to complete my felicity.&mdash;Kingly too, I could wi&s;h to hear that he was well and happy. But I will offer the &s;acrifice of thank&s;giving for the ble&s;&s;ings I have received, and for futurity tru&s;t entirely to a wi&s;e and bountiful Providence, who has never yet for&s;aken me, and who I humbly hope never will.</P>
<P>I have been once to &s;ee Kingly's children; my mother went with me: they are both well. Clara's children are at the &s;ame &s;chool and enjoy the &s;ame advantages. Generous Kingly may heaven reward you for the di&s;intere&s;ted

kindne&s;s you have &s;hewn the&s;e poor orphans, for indeed they are literally &s;o, being for|&s;aken by both father and mother.</P>
<P>My dear Celia, pray for me, that I may &s;upport this unexpected, this wonderful ele|vation of fortune as I ought, that while I &s;hare the plea&s;ures of affluence I may never forget the pangs of poverty or turn a deaf ear to the cry of affliction.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVIII. FREDERIC KINGLY, <ABBR>ESQ.</ABBR> to COL. ONSLOW.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>April</HI> 16<HI>th,</HI> 1790.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM returned to England once more; for my mind was &s;o hara&s;&s;ed by the thoughts of what might be the fate of my beloved Meriel, that my health declined, and I was advi&s;ed to &s;olicit an exchange and return to my native place; where the air might re|&s;tore me. I complied with the advice of my friends, not from any opinion of my own that I was in danger, for the complaints of the mind are &s;o far &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the body, that I was not &s;en&s;ible of my own de|clining &s;tate. Meriel, in affliction, without friends, without &s;upport, continually haunt|ed my imagination.</P>
<P>On my arrival in England, I went imme|diately to my agent. He had heard no ti|dings of her. His heart was not intere&s;ted; he had therefore made only a few inquiries
<PB N="154" REF="029439_0637_0FE11BCD65FFF378">
and finding them fruitle&s;s, had given up the &s;earch.&mdash;I determined to remain a few days in London to re&s;t after the fatigues of my voyage and then vi&s;it my dear boys.&mdash;My time hang heavy on my hands and I &s;aun|tered into a coffee hou&s;e towards the clo&s;e of evening. A brother officer acco&s;ted me; we chatted a few moments on indifferent &s;ubjects, and he propo&s;ed going to the play. I accompanied him ju&s;t to while away the time, rather than from any hope of amu&s;ement. Ju&s;t before the curtain ro&s;e, an elderly gentleman entered the box op|po&s;ite to that in which I was &s;itting, lead|ing a lady, whom at the fir&s;t glance, I knew to be my adored, my lovely Meriel. Health again adorned her countenance and &s;parkled in her eyes; yet there was im|pre&s;&s;ed on her features a &s;ort of pen&s;ive &s;hade, which &s;eemed to &s;ay, &s;he might be happier. Her dre&s;s though, &s;weetly &s;im|ple, and becoming, yet be&s;poke the wearer in affluent circum&s;tances, and the a&s;&s;idious attention of the gentleman, who accom|panied her, was evidently the effu&s;ions of tenderne&s;s. She received them with com|placency; nay, returned them with looks beaming expre&s;&s;ive affection.</P>
<P>A young man in the box with me ob&s;erved the emotions in my counteance, whil&s;t I re|garded
<PB N="155" REF="029439_0638_0FE11BD280CFC380">
her.&mdash;"Do you know that lady," &s;aid he,&mdash;"I think I do &s;ir, I have &s;ome idea that her name is Rook&s;by."&mdash;</P>
<P>"I don't know her name," &s;aid he, "but &s;he is a damn'd pretty creature, and that old fellow de&s;erves to be gibbetted for mo|nopolizing her."&mdash;</P>
<P>A chill of horror ran through my heart, can Meriel Howard, &s;aid I, mentally, be &s;unk from that eminence of virtue, which ever di&s;tingui&s;hed her, into &s;o low, &s;o piti|able a character, as to exi&s;t on the wages of pro&s;titution? "Does &s;he live with that gentleman?" &s;aid I, to my intelligencer.</P>
<P>"'Tis thought &s;o," he replied, "&s;he is quite a new face. I have &s;een her often in public with him, and &s;he &s;eldom is accom|panied by any one but an old woman, who looks like a convenient."</P>
<P>"And is that all the rea&s;on you can give" &s;aid I fiercely, "for injuring the character of a woman that ever was, and I tru&s;t ever will be free from blemi&s;h."</P>
<P>Oh! no," &s;aid he, "when I fir&s;t &s;aw her, it was at the opera; and I was told &s;he was a woman of that &s;tamp; for &s;he left her hu&s;|band
<PB N="156" REF="029439_0639_0FE11BD7D8B50320">
about a year and a half ago and lived with a young officer of the name of Kingly."</P>
<P>I was going to an&s;wer with great warmth and inquire the name of the per&s;on, who had thus dared to &s;port with my character; but my friend interpo&s;ed and obliged me to quit the play-hou&s;e without any farther in|formation.</P>
<P>This tran&s;ient glance of my dear Meriel, added to the villainous a&s;&s;ertions of the im|pertinent coxcomb, who vilified her name, had &s;uch an effect on my &s;pirits, that re&s;t was a &s;tranger to my eyes. I had not in|quired the name of the gentleman with whom I &s;aw her: it was therefore impo&s;&s;ible to trace her out. For many evenings I frequented the theatres, the opera-hou&s;e&mdash;every place of public amu&s;ement; but was &s;till un&s;uc|ce&s;sful. She was not at any, or if there, was effectually concealed from me.&mdash;Un|happy, ill, di&s;gu&s;ted with every object that &s;urrounded me, I determined one morning to vi&s;it my children, who I had previou&s;ly heard, were well, and endeavour to lo&s;e my chagrin in their innocent care&s;&s;es. The &s;chool they were at is about twenty-five miles from town. I took a po&s;t chai&s;e and arrived at the place about eleven o'clock. An elegant carriage &s;tood at the gate, which drew off to
<PB N="157" REF="029439_0640_0FE11BDCF0A7CB98">
give me room to alight. I a&s;ked the &s;ervant who opened the gate, for my boys. "They are in the parlour," &s;aid he; I followed him, in fancy anticipating their dear embraces. He threw open the parlour door. I advan|ced and &s;aw, &s;eated at the upper end of the room, &s;urrounded by the four boys, (for Clara's children are there) di&s;tributing to them, toys and fruit, the intere&s;ting figure of Mrs. Rook&s;by. A&s;toni&s;hment riveted me to the floor. She looked toward me; joy fla&s;hed from her eyes. An exclamation of &s;urpri&s;e e&s;caped her, and before either of us had time for reflection, I found I had &s;eated my&s;elf be&s;ide her and cla&s;ped her in my arms, while the dear children were climbing round, each &s;triving to be the fir&s;t to &s;hare my ca|re&s;&s;es. However joy had for a moment made her forget her&s;elf, &s;he &s;oon recovered her u&s;u|al air of cautious timidity and di&s;ingaging her|&s;elf from my embrace, &s;he pre&s;ented me to an elderly lady, whom till then I had not ob|&s;erved; and whom &s;he addre&s;&s;ed by the en|dearing title of mother. They propo&s;ed taking the children home with them and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing my chai&s;e to take a &s;eat in their coach and all return to town together.&mdash;During our ride, &s;he unfolded to me a tale of wonder, unnece&s;&s;ary here to repeat; be|cau&s;e &s;he informed me &s;he has written your Amelia a full account of it.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="029439_0641_0FE11BE18488B4A0">
I am a frequent vi&s;itor at Mr. Harcourt's, and enjoy her &s;ociety undi&s;turbed by the fears of the world's cen&s;ure; for under the &s;helter of paternal protection, who &s;hall dare to arraign her conduct? She informs me &s;he has not heard from her hu&s;band, &s;ince his relea&s;e from the King's bench: but imagines he is wandering abroad with the wild Clara. You will hardly believe it po&s;&s;ible, that young Howard, who refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t or even acknowledge the dear Meriel, when &s;he was in di&s;tre&s;s and he thought her his &s;i&s;ter, has been to pay his re&s;pects to her &s;ince he has di&s;covered &s;he is a wealthy rela|tive. She received him politely; but did not a&s;k him to repeat his vi&s;it. He is af|fluent," &s;aid &s;he, "he does not want a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and I do not wi&s;h to be pe&s;tered with his company."</P>
<P>Far different was her conduct to He&s;ter Mo&s;&s;op, who is now a widow with three children and in very indigent circum&s;tan|ces. She met Mrs. Mo&s;&s;op by accident at a perfumer's &s;hop, and judging from her ap|pearance that &s;he was no longer the wealthy, haughty woman, who had never known di&s;|tre&s;s, acco&s;ted her in a manner, that encou|raged her to make her a vi&s;it; nay, &s;he en|treated her to do &s;o. From her &s;he learned He&s;ter's nece&s;&s;ities, and he&s;itated not a mo|ment
<PB N="159" REF="029439_0642_0FE11BE62A6DADD8">
to exert her benevolence to remove them. She inquired after Su&s;an. Tears were the only an&s;wer &s;he received.&mdash;Alas! poor Su&s;an! &s;educed by Belger, led into all manner of folly by Clara, &s;he fell from one degree of vice to another, till oppre&s;&s;ed by the complicated evils of infamy, di&s;ea&s;e and a broken heart, &s;he &s;unk into an untimely grave, in her la&s;t hours in want of the com|mon nece&s;&s;aries of life. Meriel gave a tear to her memory and to &s;ooth the affliction of the mother immediately formed a plan for He&s;ter's &s;upport. She advanced money for her to take a &s;hop furni&s;hed well with haber|da&s;hery and ho&s;iery; and by the many re|commendations of Mrs. Harcourt, &s;he is like|ly to gain a very decent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Young Mo&s;&s;op is married to a rich heire&s;s; but they live in &s;ome town very di&s;tant from London, and he found it quite inconvenient to write and inquire after his mother and &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>I hope, now, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee you in England: I feel uncommonly happy, and I wi&s;h you to &s;ee and &s;hare my happine&s;s.&mdash;Methinks, the wheel of fortune has gone its round: and we who have been thrown the very bottom, are now beginning to ri&s;e. I &s;ee my dear Meriel enjoying all the com|forts, all the elegances of life&mdash;care&s;&s;ed, be|loved,
<PB N="160" REF="029439_0643_0FE11BEB3A6EE490">
e&s;teemed by all, and I cannot help indulging the flattering hope, (call it not chimerical) that I &s;hall one day call her mine! Oh! On&s;low&mdash;when that ble&s;t hour arrives! (if &s;uch an hour Heaven has in &s;tore for me) when I &s;hall &s;ee the affection of her faithful heart beam from her expre&s;|&s;ive eyes, unchecked by fear, I &s;hall think my&s;elf at the very &s;ummit of human felicity!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIX. MRS. ONSLOW to MISS SHELBURNE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>November</HI> 10<HI>th,</HI> 1790.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will perhaps be &s;urprized, my dear madam, to receive a letter from a per&s;on to whom you are a &s;tranger; but though I never was honoured with the ac|quaintance of Mi&s;s Shelburne, yet &s;he has no doubt heard of Amelia Sidney, who has been &s;o highly honoured by the friend&s;hip of our equally beloved Mrs Rook&s;by.&mdash;</P>
<P>That lady from a variety of incidents has been prevented from writing to you for &s;everal months pa&s;t; and I am now de&s;ired by her to inform you that &s;he is in health; but totally inadequate to the ta&s;k of relating to you the &s;cenes in which &s;he has been lately engaged.&mdash;I know her motive for thus declining a ta&s;k which &s;he ever con&s;idered plea&s;ureable, that of writing to her e&s;teemed Celia is delicacy: &s;he cannot inform you of
<PB N="162" REF="029439_0645_0FE11BF06DC92D18">
what has lately occurred, without making mention of her own magnanimity. Her fortitude has ever been con&s;picuous, it has &s;u&s;tained her under &s;ome of the heavie&s;t trials to which the human heart is incident; but in this la&s;t &s;he has ri&s;en almo&s;t above humanity. Pardon the expre&s;&s;ion; for I am fully &s;en&s;ible how much the human heart is capable of, it is tempered by a great, an all wi&s;e Being, who will never inflict trials be|yond our power to &s;upport;&mdash;but we daily &s;ee &s;uch in&s;tances of depravity that we look with a kind of wonder on tho&s;e who through life maintain that dignified conduct, that purity of manner and univer&s;al benevolence which is the true characteri&s;tic of Chri&s;ti|anity.&mdash;But I intrude on your patience, and defer the intere&s;ting narrative. To pro|ceed then.</P>
<P>On my arrival in England after an ab&s;ence of &s;ix years I was both &s;urprized and plea&s;ed to &s;ee the alteration which had taken place in the circum&s;tanes of our friend. She had regained all that &s;oftne&s;s, that delicacy of countenance, for which &s;he has been univer|&s;ally admired; but which &s;ickne&s;s and &s;or|row had when I left her faded into langour. She was chearful and apparently happy; but &s;till &s;ome hours of painful reflection would intrude; for &s;he was totally ignorant
<PB N="163" REF="029439_0646_0FE11BF9E1B45B60">
of the fate of her hu&s;band. He might return to England, he might demand her from her father and mother, when he found her the affluent heire&s;s of a large fortune.&mdash;The&s;e ideas continually haunted her, and &s;ometimes interrupted her mo&s;t chearful hours. Mrs. Harcourt had invited me to &s;pend a few weeks with them at a feat of their's &s;ituated on the banks of the Thames, near Wind&s;or. I accepted the invitation, and had been there near three weeks, when Mrs. Rook&s;by entered my appartment one morning, pale and ready to faint. She could not &s;peak, but put a note into my hands, which &s;he had ju&s;t received. It was from Clara&mdash;and in a few incoherent lines, repre&s;ented Rook&s;by in a mo&s;t wretched &s;i|tuation, dying and in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;I had known &s;o many in&s;tances of Clara's art, that I endeavoured to per&s;uade Mrs. Rook&s;by from the re&s;olution, &s;he had form|ed of going immediately to town and ad|mini&s;tering relief to her hu&s;band: but all I could &s;ay, joined to the united entreaties of her parents, could not prevail, and all I could do was to accompany her. She or|dered the coachman to &s;et her down accord|ing to the direction contained in Clara's bil|let. It was at a mean hou&s;e in an ob&s;cure &s;treet in We&s;tmin&s;ter.. We enquired for her hu&s;band by the name of Moreton, and was
<PB N="164" REF="029439_0647_0FE11BFE20659058">
&s;hewn up two pair of &s;tairs into a &s;mall back room, where on a bed without hangings, lay all that remained of the once elegant af|fluent Rook&s;by, worn to a &s;keleton, and in the very la&s;t &s;tage of a decline, (for he had never recovered the effects of the wound) and riot and intemperance had ha&s;tened the period of his exi&s;tence.&mdash;Be&s;ide the bed, (&s;upporting his head on her arm, the tears flowing from her eyes) &s;at Clara: but I could never have conceived it to be the love|ly Clara, who had &s;tolen the heart of Rook&s;|by from our dear friend, for her appear|ance was &s;quallid and mi&s;erable. Sunk eyes, pale cheeks, every indication of di&s;|ea&s;e and poverty was marked upon her per|&s;on.&mdash;</P>
<P>She turned her eyes towards us as we en|tered, but without changing her attitude. She has very fine eyes and in &s;pite of their languor &s;till retained &s;ufficient expre&s;&s;ion, to inform us, that &s;he was equally oppre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ituation of the poor &s;ufferer on the bed, and &s;hame at appearing in the pre|&s;ence of the woman &s;he had injured beyond reparation. Our excellent Meriel advan|ced, (checking the powerful feelings of her heart) and as with one hand, &s;he took one of her dying hu&s;band's, &s;he extended the other towards Clara: and in accents &s;carce|ly
<PB N="165" REF="029439_0648_0FE11C0383929CA0">
audible, bade her be comforted. Struck by &s;uch an uncommon proof of benevo|lence, the poor &s;uffering criminal &s;unk on her knees. She cla&s;ped the hand extended towards her, rai&s;ed her &s;treaming eyes;&mdash;but could not give vent to the fullne&s;s of her heart by words.</P>
<P>"Go," cried our magnanimous Meriel, "go, my poor penitent Clara, and compo&s;e your&s;elf: I will &s;tay and attend my hu&s;|band:" then turning to me, &s;he continued, "Shall I entreat you Amelia to return and inform my parents that you have left me in the performance of my duty: that you have left me attending the &s;ick bed of a hu&s;band, who rai&s;ed me from ob&s;curity to an elevated fortune: tell them, I remember not his er|rors&mdash;they were the children of human nature:&mdash;but his benevolence will never be obliterated from my mind.&mdash;That was the offspring of Heaven.&mdash;As &s;he &s;poke, &s;he waved her hand; I found it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;obey her, and retired from the apartment&mdash;but not from the hou&s;e. I di&s;patched a &s;hort note to Mrs. Harcourt and then exerted my&s;elf to obtain for Rook&s;by, and my dear rigidly duteous friend, every a&s;&s;i&s;tance which money could procure.&mdash;It is a &s;ad thing to acknowledge, but &s;o it was, tho&s;e very people who had &s;uffered Rook&s;by
<PB N="166" REF="029439_0649_0FE11C06158A4C28">
and Clara to want even the means to &s;upport exi&s;tence, whil&s;t they thought them de&s;titute of friends and money, no &s;ooner &s;aw them vi&s;ited by per&s;ons, who were &s;uppo&s;ed weal|thy, and beheld the contents of my pur&s;e, which fortunately was amply &s;upplied, than they were ready to run! to fly! to per|form any dirty, or painful work for which they expected to be well paid. But I mean not to make human nature de&s;picable by this ob&s;ervation. The&s;e people were poor.&mdash;And God knows we may all yield to temptations, when poverty is the &s;trong incentive.</P>
<P>I heard from my friend every hour, though &s;he her&s;elf imagined I was returned to her father and mother. About midnight I heard an extraordinary bu&s;tle up &s;tairs, and on inquiring the cau&s;e, found that Rook&s;by who had never been able to &s;peak to his angelic wife more than monofylables, &s;ince her arrival, had been &s;eized with a kind of fit, and was expected every moment to ex|pire. I thought it improper for Mrs. Rook&s;|by to be left in &s;uch a &s;ituation to the entire care of &s;trangers, and therefore &s;ent up word that I was returned from the country with a me&s;&s;age from her mother, and if &s;he plea&s;ed would come up. She &s;aid, &s;he would be happy to &s;ee me. When I went into the room I found her &s;eated on the bed, &s;upport|ing

her dying hu&s;band, who was at that time ea&s;y and &s;eemingly dozing. His right arm was encircling her wai&s;t, his head re&s;ted on her bo&s;om, &s;he pointed to a chair by the bed&s;ide, but did not &s;peak. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the bed, &s;tood a woman with volatiles which they had been applying to the no&s;e and temples of the expiring man; and at the foot was Clara on her knees her eyes elevated, her hands, cla&s;ped, and her whole countenance bearing te&s;timony to the angui&s;h that rent her &s;oul. In my life, I never &s;aw a more intere&s;ting &s;cene, nor never I hope &s;hall I witne&s;s &s;uch another.&mdash;I &s;at down in &s;ilence, and in a few moments the Phy&s;i|cian, whom Mrs. Rook&s;by had &s;ent for arrived. He pronounced the patient pa&s;t all hope, and a few hours confirmed the &s;entence. It was near &s;even o'clock, when &s;tarting as it were from &s;leep, he gazed ar|dently on his wife.</P>
<P>"Oh Meriel," &s;aid he, "I dreamt I was in the realms of bli&s;s and you conducted me there. Ble&s;&s;ed woman, if you forgive me, if you pray for my enterance into that place of eternal peace; I &s;hall, I know I &s;hall, be received.&mdash;"Oh!" &s;aid &s;he, with fervour, "May Heaven &s;o forgive my offences as I pardon every offence of yours toward me.&mdash;"But Clara," cried he,
<PB N="168" REF="029439_0651_0FE11C102BB09200">
"poor guilty Clara!"&mdash;"I will be her friend," replied Mrs. Rook&s;by. "Enough," &s;aid he, "may every ble&s;&s;ing crown you here, and everla&s;ting joys"&mdash;He could not fini&s;h the &s;entence, but remained &s;ilent and almo&s;t inanimate for the &s;pace of half an hour. He then moved and took a cordial which &s;he offered him. I prevailed on her to quit her painful &s;ituation at the head of the bed and let him lye down. She did &s;o, but he &s;till retained her hand.&mdash;Ju&s;t before the final &s;cene clo&s;ed, he rai&s;ed him|&s;elf a little, and looking earne&s;tly in her face&mdash;"My children," he cried, "my dear boys."&mdash;"Are they not mine," &s;he replied in an accent to which no words can do ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>"Oh! what a wretch I have been!!!"&mdash;&s;aid he.&mdash;His head &s;unk on her &s;houlder, he endeavoured to throw his arms around her, but Death had arre&s;ted their power.&mdash;He groaned&mdash;&s;truggled for the power of utterance&mdash;and in that &s;truggle expired.</P>
<P>I knew the extreme &s;en&s;ibility of the heart with which I had to deal. I attempt|ed not to con&s;ole her, I rather encouraged her to give a loo&s;e to her feelings, and in a few hours &s;he became &s;ufficiently compo|&s;ed to &s;ubmit to my direction, and &s;uffer her|&s;elf to be conveyed to her father and mother:
<PB N="169" REF="029439_0652_0FE11C15C8CECE78">
but not 'till &s;he had given proper directions for the future &s;upport of Clara. This un|happy woman confe&s;&s;ed in the angui&s;h of her heart, that at the very moment when our incomparable friend gave her a&s;&s;i&s;tance and countenance in Devon&s;hire, &s;he was ploting her ruin, that the chief part of the letter &s;he wrote to her, and of which you have had a copy was the invention of her own brain, and that from a very child &s;he has been the off&s;pring of folly.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mrs. Rook&s;by heard her confe&s;&s;ion with|out any emotion, &s;ave that of compa&s;&s;ion, and when &s;he had fini&s;hed, bade her not de&s;pair but re&s;olve on a new cour&s;e of life, and tru&s;t in that bounteous Creator for par|don, who never turned from the truly peni|tent.&mdash;She has &s;ent this unfortunate and I may &s;ay guilty woman into Wales, were &s;he has become re&s;pon&s;ible for her board, and allows her ten pounds a year for her pocket and extra expences. The children &s;he has taken entirely under her own care.</P>
<P>My dear Mi&s;s Shelburne, I cannot help now indulging the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, that I &s;hall &s;ee this worthy woman rewarded for all her &s;ufferings; &s;hall &s;ee her &s;oon united to the man to whom for many years &s;he has been &s;incerely attached, and from whom only the mo&s;t cruel treachery could

have &s;eparated her;&mdash;for He&s;ter Mo&s;&s;op has confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he was the author of tho&s;e letters which prevented her union with Rainsforth. We do not let Mr. Harcourt know that He&s;ter has made this confe&s;&s;ion, for he would never forgive her, and I much fear would in&s;i&s;t on Mrs. Rook&s;by's with|drawing her friend&s;hip entirely from her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rook&s;by bid me &s;ay &s;he will write as &s;oon as &s;he is able, and in the mean time de&s;ires you will believe &s;he can never be otherwi&s;e than your friend, and in the &s;ame rank begs leave to be placed,</P>

<P>I HAVE foreborn to write; becau&s;e I knew my dear Amelia had informed you of every material occurrence. I knew

&s;he had told you that I had promi&s;ed after my year of mourning was expired, to give my hand to the man, who fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my heart. That year was ended on this very day, and I am now the wife of Kingly. I could almo&s;t find it in my heart to renounce the name and &s;ay, I am the wife of Rain&s;|forth.&mdash;</P>
<P>My dear Celia, pray for me, that the tide of joy, which now ru&s;hes on my heart, may not impair my gratitude, or lead me through my adoration of the creature to forget the Creator, to whom only adoration is due.</P>
<P>Oh, Heavenly Providence! am I indeed thus happy&mdash;yes, it is a ble&s;t reality. I can look up to a father to whom it is an honour to be allied. I can &s;ee the &s;weet effu&s;ions of maternal tenderne&s;s beam on me from a be|loved mother's eyes. I am united to the man of my heart, I am the adopted mother of his children.&mdash;Where! where! is there a human being as &s;uperlatively happy as my|&s;elf? happier they cannot be. I can lay my hand on my heart and fervently pray even for the felicity of my enemies. Enemies did I &s;ay, I will forget I ever had any, pa&s;t &s;cenes of &s;orrow &s;hall be obliterated from my me|mory, and remembering only the pre&s;ent happine&s;s I will endeavour to de&s;erve its

<P>Mrs. On&s;low de&s;ires remembrances to you. My hu&s;band bids me &s;ay, &s;hould the com|motions which at pre&s;ent agitate the Gallic &s;hore, di&s;turb you in your religious retreat; remember, you have a home, to which you can with confidence repair&mdash;a home, where you will be received with tran&s;port, and where you may con&s;ider your&s;elf in the man|&s;ion of a &s;i&s;ter!
