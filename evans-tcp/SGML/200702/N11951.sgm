<HEAD>PLAIN TRUTH; CONTAINING REMARKS ON A LATE PAMPHLET, ENTITLED, COMMON SENSE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now before me the Pamphlet, entitled COMMON SENSE; on which I &s;hall remark with freedom and candour. It may not be improper to remind my rea|der, that the inve&s;tigation of my &s;ubject, demands the utmo&s;t freedom of enquiry. I therefore entreat his indulgence; and that he will carefully remember, that intempe|rate zeal, is as injurious to liberty, as a manly di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of facts is friendly to it. "Liberty, &s;ays the great MONTESQUIEU, is a right of doing whatever the laws permit; and if a citizen could do what they forbid, he would no longer be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of liberty, be|cau&s;e all his fellow citizens would have the &s;ame power." In the beginning of his pamphlet, the Author a&s;&s;erts, that &s;ociety in every &s;tate is a ble&s;&s;ing. This in the &s;ince|rity of my heart I deny; for it is &s;upreme mi&s;ery to be a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e, who to promote their ambitious purpo&s;es, flagiti|ou&s;ly
<PB N="2" REF="015088_0009_0F95E4525D2C4AD0">
pervert the ends of political &s;ociety. I do not &s;ay that our Author is indebted to BURGH'S POLITICAL DISQUISITIONS, or to ROUSSEAU'S Social Compact for his de|finition of Government, and his large Tree; although I wi&s;h he had favoured his reader with the following extract from that &s;ub|lime rea&s;oner. "To inve&s;tigate tho&s;e con|ditions of &s;ociety which may be&s;t an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of nations, would require the abi|lities of &s;ome &s;uperior intelligence, who &s;hould be witne&s;s to all the pa&s;&s;ions of men, but be &s;ubject it&s;elf to none, who &s;hould have no connections with human nature, but &s;hould have a perfect knowledge of it: A Being, in &s;hort, who&s;e happine&s;s &s;hould be independent of us, and who would neverthele&s;s employ it&s;elf about us. It is the province of Gods to make laws for Men." With the utmo&s;t deference to the cele|brated ROUSSEAU, I cannot indeed ima|gine, that laws even &s;o con&s;tructed, would materially benefit our imperfect race; unle&s;s omni&s;cience deigned previou&s;ly to exalt our nature. The judicious reader will therefore perceive, that malevolence only, is requi|&s;ite to declaim again&s;t, and arraign the mo&s;t perfect governments. Our <HI>Political Quack,</HI> avails him&s;elf of this trite expedient, to ca|jole the people into the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery,
<PB N="3" REF="015088_0010_0F95E45296C6C7B0">
under the delu&s;ive name of independence. His fir&s;t indecent attack is again&s;t the Engli&s;h con&s;titution; which with all its imperfec|tions, is, and ever will be the pride and envy of mankind. To this panegyric involunta|rily our author &s;ub&s;cribes, by granting indi|viduals to be &s;afer in England, than in any other part of Europe. He indeed in&s;idi|ou&s;ly attributes this pre-eminent excellency, to the con&s;titution of the people, rather than to our excellent con&s;titution. To &s;uch contemptible &s;ubterfuge is our Author reduced. I would a&s;k him, why did not the con&s;titution of the people afford them &s;uperior &s;afety, in the reign of Richard the Third, Henry the Eighth, and other tyrannic princes? Many pages might indeed be filled with encomiums be&s;towed on our excellent con&s;titution, by illu&s;trious authors of different nations.</P>
<P>This beautiful &s;y&s;tem (according to MONTESQUIEU) our con&s;titution is a com|pound of Monarchy, Ari&s;tocracy, and De|mocracy. But it is often &s;aid, that the Sovereign, by honours and appointments, influences the Commons. The profound and elegant HUME agitating this que&s;tion, thinks, to this circum&s;tance, we are in part indebted for our &s;upreme felicity; &s;ince without &s;uch controul in the Crown; our
<PB N="4" REF="015088_0011_0F95E4535A84AA70">
Con&s;titution would immediately degenerate into Democracy; a government, which in the &s;equel, I hope to prove ineligible. Were I a&s;ked marks of the be&s;t government, and the purpo&s;e of political &s;ociety, I would re|ply, the encrea&s;e, pre&s;ervation, and pro&s;pe|rity of its members, in no quarter of the Globe, are tho&s;e marks &s;o certainly to be found, as in Great Britain, and her depend|encies. After our Author has employed &s;everal pages, to break the mounds of &s;ociety by deba&s;ing Monarchs: He &s;ays, "The plain truth is, that the antiquity of Engli&s;h Monarchy will not bear looking into."</P>
<P>HUME treating of the original contract, has the following melancholy, but &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervation, "Yet rea&s;on tells us, that there is no property in durable objects, &s;uch as lands, and hou&s;es, when carefully ex|amined, in pa&s;&s;ing from hand to hand, but mu&s;t in &s;ome period, have been founded on fraud and inju&s;tice. The nece&s;&s;ities of hu|man &s;ociety, neither in private or public life, will allow of &s;uch an accurate enquiry; and there is no virtue or moral duty, but what may, with facility, be refined away, if we indulge a fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, in &s;ifting and &s;crutinizing, by every captious rule of logic, in every light or po&s;ition in which it may be placed."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="015088_0012_0F95E454163A3750">
Say ye votaries of honour and truth, can we adduce a &s;tronger proof of our Author's turpitude, than his quoting the anti-phi|lo&s;ophical &s;tory of the Jews, to deba&s;e Monarchy, and the be&s;t of Monarchs. Briefly examining the &s;tory of this contemp|tible race, more barbarous than our &s;avages: We find their hi&s;tory a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of miracles, a&s;toni&s;hing our imaginations, and exerci&s;ing our faith. After wandering forty years in horrid de&s;arts, they are chiefly condemned to peri&s;h for their perver&s;ene&s;s, although under the immediate dominion of the KING of HEAVEN. At length, they arrive in the &s;terile country of Pale&s;tine; which they conquer, by exterminating the inhabitants, and warring like Demons. The inhabitants of the adjoining regions, ju&s;tly therefore held them in dete&s;tation, and the Jews finding them&s;elves con&s;tantly abhorred, have ever &s;ince hated all man|kind. This people, as de&s;titute of arts and indu&s;try, as humanity, had not even in their language a word expre&s;&s;ive of education. We might indeed remind our Author, who &s;o readily drags in the Old Te&s;tament to &s;upport his &s;ini&s;ter mea&s;ures; that we could draw from that &s;ource, many texts, favour|able to Monarchy, were we not con&s;cious, that the Mo&s;aic Law, gives way to the
<PB N="6" REF="015088_0013_0F95E454E3C82418">
Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation. The reader no doubt will be gratified by the following extract from a mo&s;t primitive Chri&s;tian. "Chri&s;ti|anity is a &s;piritual religion, relative only to cele&s;tial objects. The Chri&s;tian's inheri|tance is not of this world. He performs his duty it is true, but this he does with a profound indifference for the good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of his endeavours: Provided he hath nothing to reproach him&s;elf, it is of little con&s;equence to him whether matters go well or ill here below. If the &s;tate be in a flouri&s;hing condition, he can hardly venture to rejoice in the public felicity, lea&s;t he &s;hould be puffed up, with the inordinate pride of his country's glory. If the &s;tate decline, he ble&s;&s;es the hand of GOD, that humbles his people to the du&s;t."</P>
<P>Having defined the be&s;t government, I will humbly attempt to de&s;cribe good Kings by the following unerring rule. The be&s;t Princes are con&s;tantly calumniated by the envenomed tongues and pens of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of their &s;ubjects. For this me|lancholy truth, do I appeal to the te&s;timony of impartial hi&s;torians; and long experience. The noble impartial hi&s;torian Sully, &s;peak|ing of the almo&s;t divine Henry the Fourth of France &s;ays, "Thus was this god like prince repre&s;ented (by the di&s;contented of
<PB N="7" REF="015088_0014_0F95E455A9060F58">
the&s;e days) almo&s;t throughout his whole kingdom, as a furious, and implacable tyrant: They were never without one &s;et of arguments to engage his catholic nobility in a rebellion again&s;t him; and another to &s;ow &s;edition among his prote&s;tant officers and gentry." HUME &s;ays, that the cruel unrelenting tyrant, Philip the Second of Spain, with his infernal Inqui&s;ition, was not more dete&s;ted by the people of the Netherlands; than was the humane Char|les, with his inoffen&s;ive Liturgy; by his mutinous &s;ubjects. The many unmerited in&s;ults offered to our gracious Sovereign; by the unprincipled Wilkes, and others down to this late Author; will forever di&s;grace humanity. For he &s;ays, "that mo|narchy was the mo&s;t pro&s;perous inventi|on the Devil ever &s;et on foot for the pro|motion of idolatry. It is the pride of Kings which throws mankind into confu&s;ion: In &s;hort, continues this Author, monarchy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, have laid not this or that king|dom only, but the World in blood and a&s;hes." How deplorably wretched the condition of mankind, could they believe &s;uch execrable flagitious jargon. Unhap|pily indeed, mankind in every age are &s;u&s;|ceptible of delu&s;ion; but &s;urely our Au|thor's poi&s;on carries its antidote with it.
<PB N="8" REF="015088_0015_0F95E45664E92090">
Attentive to the &s;pirit of his publication, we fancy our&s;elves in the barbarous fif|teenth century; in which period our Au|thor would have figured with his " Common Sen&s;e&mdash;and blood will attend it."</P>
<P>After his terrible anathema again&s;t our venerable con&s;titution, and monarchy; let us briefly examine a democratical &s;tate; and &s;ee whether or not it is a government le&s;s &s;anguinary. This government is extremely plau&s;ible, and indeed flattering to the pride of mankind. The demagogues therefore, to &s;educe the people into their criminal de|&s;igns ever hold up democracy to them; although con&s;cious it never did, nor ever will an&s;wer in practice. If we believe a great Author, " There never exi&s;ted, nor ever will exi&s;t a real democracy in the World." If we examine the republics of Greece and Rome, we ever find them in a &s;tate of war dome&s;tic or foreign. Our Author therefore makes no mention of the&s;e ancient States. "When Alexander ordered all the exiles, to be re&s;tored throughout all the cities, it was found that the whole amounted to twenty thou&s;and, the remains probably of &s;till greater &s;laugh|ters and ma&s;&s;acres. What an a&s;toni&s;hing number in &s;o narrow a country as ancient Greece? and what dome&s;tic confu&s;ion,
<PB N="9" REF="015088_0016_0F95E457263F8100">
jealou&s;y, partiality, revenge, heart-burn|ings mu&s;t tear tho&s;e cities, where factions were wrought up to &s;uch a degree of fury and de&s;pair." Apian's hi&s;tory of the civil wars of Rome, contains the mo&s;t fright|ful picture of ma&s;&s;acres, pro&s;criptions, and forfeitures that ever were pre&s;ented to the world.</P>
<P>The excellent Monte&s;quieu declares, "That a democracy &s;uppo&s;es the concur|rence of a number of circum&s;tances rarely united, in the fir&s;t place, it is requi&s;ite that the &s;tate it&s;elf &s;hould be of &s;mall extent; &s;o that the people might be ea&s;ily a&s;&s;embled and per&s;onally known to each other. Se|condly, the &s;implicity of their manners, &s;hould be &s;uch as to prevent a multiplicity of affairs, and perplexity in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing them: And thirdly, there &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t a great de|gree of equality between them, in point of right and authority: La&s;tly, there &s;hould be little or no luxury, for luxury mu&s;t either be the eflect of wealth, or it mu&s;t make it nece&s;&s;ary. It corrupts at once, both rich and poor: The one, by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the other, by the want of it."To this may be added continues the &s;ame Author, "that no government is &s;o &s;ubject to CIVIL WARS, and INTESTINE COMMO|TIONS, as that of the democratical or po|pular
<PB N="10" REF="015088_0017_0F95E457D4AF0B40">
form; becau&s;e, no other tends &s;o &s;trongly and &s;o con&s;tantly to alter, nor re|quires &s;o much vigilance, and fortitude to pre&s;erve it from alteration. It is indeed, in &s;uch a con&s;titution, particularly, that a Citizen &s;hould always be armed with for|titude, and con&s;tancy; and &s;hould every day, in the &s;incerity of his heart, guard again&s;t corruption, ari&s;ing either from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in him&s;elf, or in his compatriots; for if it once enters into public tran&s;actions, to root it out afterwards would be miraculous.</P>
<P>Our Author a&s;&s;erts, that Holland and Swi&s;&s;erland are without wars dome&s;tic or foreign. About a century ago, Holland was in a few weeks over-run by the arms of France, and almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly &s;aved by the gallantry of her Prince of Orange, &s;o celebrated afterwards by the name of Wil|liam the Third. Almo&s;t from that period, until the treaty of Utrecht, Holland was a principal in wars, the mo&s;t expen&s;ive and bloody, ever waged by humankind. The wounds &s;he then received were unhealed in 1744, when reluctantly rou&s;ed from her pacific lethargy, &s;he was dragged into war; and lo&s;ing her impregnable Bergenopzoom, and Mae&s;tricht; was again on the brink of becoming a province to France, when happily liberated by the Briti&s;h Nation.
<PB N="11" REF="015088_0018_0F95E45896F096D0">
In the war of 1756. Holland continually in&s;ulted in the capture of her &s;hips, by our crui&s;ers; pre&s;erved a humiliating neutrali|ty. If victory indeed had not crowned the the Briti&s;h banners; the Dutch indubitably would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted their natural Allies, in whatever quarter of the globe attacked: For it is inconte&s;tibly true; that the exi&s;tence of Holland, as a State, depends, and in|variably will depend, on the pro&s;perity of Great Britain. Since the murder of Barne|velt, and the immortal Dewits, by the de|luded furious people, Holland hath too often been convul&s;ed by anarchy, and torn by party. Unfortunately alas! for the cau&s;e of humanity; the rugged and incult de&s;erts of Swi&s;&s;erland, preclude not ambi|tion, &s;edition, and anarchy. Her bleak and barren mountains do not &s;o effectu|ally &s;ecure precarious liberty, as daily vend|ing her &s;ons to the adjoining nations, parti|cularly to France; by whom the thirteen Cantons, could be &s;ubjected in as many days, did that court meditate &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s and delu&s;ive an object. Nugatory indeed, if we con&s;ider, that France derives more &s;ub&s;tantial advantage from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Swi&s;&s;erland, than if &s;he exhau&s;ted her&s;elf, to maintain numerous Battalions, to bridle the Cantons.

<P>If he means, that had this Continent been unexplored, the original inhabitants would have been happier: For once, I agree with him. Previous to the &s;ettlement of the&s;e Provinces by our Ance&s;tors. The kingdom of France was convul&s;ed by religious phrenzy. This, and Seba&s;tian Cabot's prior di&s;covery, perhaps, happily afforded the people of England, an opportunity of locating the&s;e Provinces. At length, peace being re&s;tored to France, by her Hero, Henry the Fourth: His nation in turn, were &s;eized with the rage of colonizing. Finding the Engli&s;h claimed the Provinces on the Atlantic; they appropriated the

&s;now banks of Canada, which we dare not &s;uppo&s;e, they would have preferred to the&s;e fertile Provinces, had not the prior occu|pancy, and power of England interfered. I hope it will not be denied, that the notice taken of us, at this time by an European Power, was rather favourable for us.&mdash;Certain it is, had not England then taken notice of us, the&s;e delectable Provinces would now appertain to France; and the people of New England, horrid to think, would now be counting their beads. Some years after the Aera in que&s;tion, the civil wars intervening in England, afforded to the Swedes and Dutch, a footing on this Con|tinent. Charles the Second being re&s;tored; England reviving her claim, rendered abor|tive the Swedi&s;h preten&s;ions; and by con|que&s;t, and granting Surinam to the Dutch, procured the ce&s;&s;ion of ther u&s;urpation, now New York. I do indeed confe&s;s, my in|capacity to di&s;cern the injury &s;u&s;tained by this &s;econd "notice taken of us, by an European Power;" in default of which in|tervention, the Swedes, to this hour, would have retained their &s;ettlement, now the famed Penn&s;ylvania; and the Dutch, con|&s;equently, had retained theirs. Some time after this period, the people of New Eng|and were employed, in framing and exe|cuting

laws, &s;o intolerant and &s;anguinary, that to us, they &s;eem adapted for devils, not men.</P>
<P>Indeed it is worthy of note, that the in|habitants of Jamaica, Barbadoes, and Vir|ginia, at that very time, enacted laws, breathing the &s;pirit of humanity, and &s;uch as men could bear. Soon after the period in que&s;tion, arrived the great and good WILLIAM PENN, with his philo&s;ophic people called Quakers; together with to|leration, indu&s;try, and permanent credit. The people of England, encouraged by the exten&s;ion of their laws and commerce to tho&s;e colonies, powerfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted our merchants and planters, in&s;omuch, that our &s;ettlements encrea&s;ed rapidly, and throve apace. It may be affirmed, that from this period, until the pre&s;ent unhap|py hour. No part of human kind, ever experienced more perfect felicity. Vol|taire indeed &s;ays, that if ever the Golden Age exi&s;ted, it was in Penn&s;ylvania. France di&s;gu&s;ted with the unhappy &s;ituation of her American Colonies, had long me|ditated the conque&s;t of one of our middle provinces. To accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e, &s;he extended a line of forts on our fron|tiers, and actually fortified the place now called Pitt&s;burgh. Ju&s;tly alarmed by the&s;e

encroachments in the hour of our di&s;tre&s;s, we called aloud on Great Britain for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, nor was &s;he deaf to our cries. The Engli&s;h mini&s;try, after in vain ex|hau&s;ting all the arts of negociation, de|clared war again&s;t France. After &s;pilling torrents of blood, after expending one hun|dred and ninety millions of their dollars, and four or five millions of ours. They gloriou&s;ly reduced the French &s;ettlements. Surely it will not be &s;aid, that this la&s;t NOTICE taken of us by the people of England, was injurious to us. Our ene|mies indeed allege, that this la&s;t interven|tion by bloating us with pride, will even|tually ruin us, and render the people of Britain objects of deri&s;ion, for lavi&s;hing their blood and trea&s;ure, in defence of provinces; "a match not only for Europe, (according to our author,) but for the world."&mdash;Our author next remarks&punc; "that the commerce by which &s;he hath en|riched her&s;elf, are the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and will always have a market while eating is the cu&s;tom of Europe,"</P>
<P>I reply, that our exporting grain, is as it were of ye&s;terday, that the recent de|mand was principally occa&s;ioned by the di&s;tractions in Poland, and other parts of Europe, and probably will totally or partly

fail, &s;oon as the fertile country of Poland, and more fertile Ukraine &s;hall again become cultivated. I believe the Europeans did eat before our merchants exported our grain, and perhaps will eat, when they cea&s;e to export it. I deny, that this momentary commerce hath enriched us; and I could adduce numberle&s;s melancholy proofs of the contrary. I &s;hall only remark, that in the mo&s;t fertile and delectable wheat coun|try in America, bounded by Che&s;opeak-bay, and almo&s;t adjoining that of Delaware. A tract of the be&s;t wheat land ten years ago, would hardly have exceeded a guinea and a half per acre, indeed, in 1773, &s;uch land covered with wood, would &s;carcely have &s;old for four guineas an acre, an undoubted proof of want of PEOPLE, indu&s;try, and wealth; particular|ly &s;o, if we con&s;ider that one crop of corn and wheat on &s;uch land judiciou&s;ly cultivated, would actually repay the &s;up|po&s;ed price. Our author a&s;&s;erts, "that our pre&s;ent numbers are &s;ufficient to repel the force of all the world. That the Con|tinent hath at this time the large&s;t di&s;ci|plined army of ANY POWER UNDER HEAVEN. That the Engli&s;h navy is only worth three millions and a half &s;terling," which, in effect, would reduce it to thirty-five

&s;hips of the line, twenty &s;hips of forty guns, twenty of thirty-&s;ix, and eight of twenty guns. "That if America had only a twentieth part of this force, &s;he would be by far an over-match for Britain, that Independence is nece&s;&s;ary, be|cau&s;e France and Spain cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t us, until &s;uch an event;" he al&s;o affirms, "that Great Britain cannot govern us, and that no good can ari&s;e from a reconciliation with her."</P>
<P>I &s;hall humbly endeavour to &s;hew, that our author &s;hamefully mi&s;repre&s;ents facts, is ignorant of the true &s;tate of Great Britain and her Colonies, utterly unquali|fied for the arduous ta&s;k, he has pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly a&s;&s;umed; and ardently intent on &s;educing us to that precipice on which him&s;elf &s;tands trembling. To elucidate my &s;trictures, I mu&s;t with fidelity expo&s;e the circum&s;tances of Great Britain and her colonies. If therefore, in the energy of de&s;cription, I unfold certain bold and hone&s;t truths with &s;implicity, the judi|cious reader will remember, that true knowledge of our &s;ituation, is as e&s;&s;ential to our &s;afety, as ignorance thereof may en|danger it. In the Engli&s;h provinces, ex|clu&s;ive of negroe and other &s;laves, we have one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and; or one hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and men capable
<PB N="18" REF="015088_0025_0F95E45E9ED6DA08">
of bearing arms. If we deduct the people called Quakers, Anabapti&s;ts, and other re|ligioni&s;ts aver&s;e to arms; a con&s;iderable part of the emigrants, and tho&s;e having a grateful predilection for the ancient con&s;titution and parent &s;tate, we &s;hall certainly reduce the fir&s;t number to &s;ixty or &s;eventy thou&s;and men. Now admitting tho&s;e equal to the Roman legions, can we &s;uppo&s;e them ca|pable of defending again&s;t the power of Britain, a country nearly twelve hundred miles extending on the ocean. Suppo&s;e our troops a&s;&s;embled in New-England, if the Britons &s;ee not fit to a&s;&s;ail them, they ha&s;te to and de&s;olate our other provinces, which eventually would reduce New Eng|land. If by dividing our forces, we pre|tend to defend our provinces, we al&s;o are infallibly undone. Our mo&s;t fertile pro|vinces, filled with unnumbered dome&s;tic enemies, &s;laves; inter&s;ected by navigable rivers, every where acce&s;&s;ible to the fleets and armies of Britain, can make no defence. If without the medium of pa&s;|&s;ion and prejudice, we view our other pro|vinces, half armed, de&s;titute of money and a navy: We mu&s;t confe&s;s, that no power ever engaged &s;uch POTENT ANTAGONISTS, under &s;uch peculiar circum&s;tances of infe|licity. In the better days of Rome, &s;he
<PB N="19" REF="015088_0026_0F95E45F5FF90730">
permitted no regular troops to defend her. Men de&s;titute of property the admitted not into her militia, (her only army.) I have been extremely concerned at the &s;eparation of the Connecticut men from our army. It au|gur'd not an ardent enthu&s;ia&s;m for liberty and glory. We &s;till have an army before Bo&s;ton, and I &s;hould be extremely happy to hear &s;ub&s;tantial proofs of their glory. I am &s;till hopeful of great things from our army before Bo&s;ton, when joined by the regi|ments now forming, which WANT OF BREAD will probably &s;oon fill. Notwith|&s;tanding the predilection I have for my countrymen, I remark with grief, that hi|therto our troops have di&s;played but few marks of Spartan or Roman enthu&s;ia&s;m. In the &s;incerity of my heart, I adjure the rea|der to believe, that no per&s;on is more &s;en&s;ibly afflicted by hearing the enemies of America remark, that no General ever fell &s;ingly and &s;o ingloriou&s;ly unrevenged before the in|au&s;picious affair of Quebec. I am under no doubt, however, that we &s;hall become as famed for martial courage, as any na|tion ever the &s;un beheld. Sanguine as I am, re&s;pecting the virtue and courage of my countrymen, depending on the hi&s;tory of mankind, &s;ince the Chri&s;tian Aera, I can|not however imagine, that zeal for liberty
<PB N="20" REF="015088_0027_0F95E46022C8D0D0">
will animate to &s;uch glorious efforts of heroi&s;m, as religious enthu&s;ia&s;m hath often impelled its votaries to perform. If the cruel unrelenting tyrant Philip the &s;e|cond of Spain, had never attempted to in|troduce into the Low Countries, the infer|nal tribunal of the Inqui&s;ition: It is mo&s;t probable, that the pre&s;ent States of Hol|land, would to this time have remained provinces to Spain, and patiently paid the fiftieth penny and other grievous exactions. Certain it is, that the fana|ticks of Scotland, and people of England, had never armed again&s;t the fir&s;t Charles, if religious enthu&s;ia&s;m had not more powerfully agitated their minds, than zeal for liberty, the operations of which, on the human mind, hath &s;ince the Aera in que&s;tion, ever been more languid, than the former mo&s;t powerful pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e hardy a&s;&s;ertions, are &s;upported as well by notorious facts, as by the learned HUME, and other judicious hi&s;torians. I cannot here omit remarking the incon&s;i&s;tency of human nature. The Scotch, the mo&s;t furious enthu&s;ia&s;ts then in Europe, were &s;laughtered like &s;heep, by Cromwell at Dunbar, where their formidable army hardly made any re&s;i&s;tance, if we except that made by a handful of loyali&s;ts, de&s;ti|tute
<PB N="21" REF="015088_0028_0F95E460DF8780B0">
of that pa&s;&s;ion. Certain it is, that tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts, were often cut in pieces by their countryman, the gallant Marquis of Montro&s;e, who&s;e troops (Highlanders and other loyali&s;ts,) held Pre&s;byteriani&s;m in contempt.</P>
<P>With the utmo&s;t deference to the honor|able Congre&s;s; I do not view the mo&s;t di&s;tant gleam of aid from foreign powers. The princes alone, capable of &s;uccouring us, are the Sovereign's of France and Spain. If according to our Author, we po&s;&s;e&s;s an eighth part of the habitable globe, and ac|tually have a check on the We&s;t India commerce of England. The French indigo, and other valuable We&s;t India commodities, and the Spani&s;h galeons, are in great jeopardy from our power. The French and Spaniards, are therefore wretched politicians, if they do not a&s;&s;i&s;t England, in reducing her co|lonies to obedience.&mdash;Plea&s;antry apart! Can we be &s;o deluded, to expect aid from tho&s;e princes, which in&s;piring their &s;ubjects with a reli&s;h for liberty, might eventually &s;hake their arbitrary thrones.&mdash;Natural a|vowed enemies to our &s;acred cau&s;e: Will they cheri&s;h, will they &s;upport the flame of liberty in America? Ardently intent, on extingui&s;h|ing its latent dying &s;parks in their re&s;pective dominions. Can we believe, that tho&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="015088_0029_0F95E461D3E54EB8">
princes will offer an example &s;o dangerous to their &s;ubjects and colonies, by aiding tho&s;e provinces to independence? If inde|pendent, aggrandized by infinite numbers from every part of Europe, this Continent would rapidly attain power a&s;toni&s;hing to imagination. Soon, very &s;oon would we be conditioned to conquer Mexico; and all their We&s;t India &s;ettlements, which to an|noy, or po&s;&s;e&s;s, we indeed are mo&s;t happily &s;ituated.

Be it however admitted, that tho&s;e princes unmindful of the fatal policy of RICHLIEU'S arming Charles's &s;ubjects again&s;t him, and the more fatal policy of LEWIS the fourteenth permitting our glorious deliverer to effect the Revolution. I &s;ay, be it admitted, that tho&s;e princes regardle&s;s of future con&s;e|quences, and the ineptitude of the times, are really di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uccour us. Say, ye friends of liberty and mankind, would no danger accrue from an army of French and Spaniards in the bo&s;om of America? would ye not dread their junction with the Canadians and Savages, and with the numerous Roman Catholics, di&s;per&s;ed throughout the Colonies?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="015088_0030_0F95E46444CA2E58">
Let us now briefly view the pre-emi|nently envied &s;tate of Great Britain. If we regard the power of Britain, unembarra&s;&s;ed with Continental connections, and the po|litical balance, we may ju&s;tly pronounce her what our author does, AMERICA;&mdash;"A match for all Europe." Amazing were the efforts of England, in the war of Queen Ann, when little benefited by co|lony commerce, and e'er &s;he had availed her&s;elf of the courage, good &s;en&s;e, and numbers of the people of Scotland and Ireland.</P>
<P>That England then pre&s;cribed laws to Europe, will be long remembered. La&s;t war, her glory was, if po&s;&s;ible, more emi|nently exalted, in every quarter of the globe did victory hover round her armies and navies, and her fame re-echoed from pole to pole. At pre&s;ent Great Britain is the umpire of Europe. It is not exaggeration to affirm, that the Ru&s;&s;ians principally are indebted for their laurels, to her power, which alone retained France from prevent|ing the ruin of her ancient faithful ally, The Ottoman Porte, &s;uperfluous it were to enumerate her powerful alliances, or men|tion her immen&s;e re&s;ources. Her rai&s;ing the incredible &s;ums of eighteen, nineteen, and twenty-two millions &s;terling for the &s;er|vice
<PB N="24" REF="015088_0031_0F95E464AB8C8770">
of the years 1759-60, and 61, was more a&s;toni&s;hing to Europe, than the victories of her fleets and armies. The annual rents of the kingdom of England only, many years ago, amounted to thirty three millions &s;ter|ling. Thirty five millions bu&s;hels of wheat are annually produced in that kingdom; and perhaps as many bu&s;hels of other grain: Twelve millions of fleeces of wool are there yearly &s;horn. In &s;hort, the Kingdom is a perfect Bee-hive, in numbers and indu&s;try; and is &s;aid to contain more indu&s;try, con&s;equently more wealth, than all the re&s;t of Europe. The famed HUME &s;ays, "I &s;hould as &s;oon dread, that all our rivers and &s;prings, &s;hould be exhau&s;ted, as that money &s;hould abandon a kingdom, where there are people and indu&s;try." The Briti&s;h navy, at the clo&s;e of la&s;t war, con&s;i&s;ted of nearly two hundred &s;hips of the line, one hundred large frigates, and about one hundred &s;maller frigates, or other armed ve&s;&s;els. Since the peace, I believe, the navy has been mo&s;t vigilantly pre&s;erved by Lord Sandwich, (&s;aid to be as equal to that ardous department, as any man in Europe&punc;) Since the war, &s;everal capital &s;hips have an|nually been built; and it is mo&s;t certain, that on &s;ix months notice, Great Britain could equip fleets, &s;ufficiently formidable, to con|tend with all the naval force, that could,
<PB N="25" REF="015088_0032_0F95E465633F8388">
or would act again&s;t her. The immen&s;e quantity of naval and other &s;tores, in the different ar&s;enals, with the royal navy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seventeen capital &s;hips were built from 1763 until 1771.</NOTE> can|not at this time be worth le&s;s than twenty millions &s;terling. The i&s;land of Great Bri|tain, between &s;ix and &s;even hundred miles in length, and upwards of two thou&s;and miles circumference; and being every where indented with harbours, forms (with other cau&s;es) &s;uch nur&s;eries of &s;eamen, as the world cannot produce.</P>
<P>Let us now examine our Author's ac|count of the navy of Great-Britain. "It is &s;ays he, worth no more than three mil|lions and an half &s;terling." This in effect will reduce it to ten &s;econd rate &s;hips of war, ten third rate, fifteen fourth rate, ten &s;hips of forty guns, ten of thirty-&s;ix, and eight of twenty. "If America &s;ays he, had only a twentieth part of the naval force of Britain, &s;he would be by far an over-match for her, becau&s;e as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our whole force would be employed on our own coa&s;t; where we &s;hould in the long-run have two to one the advantage of tho&s;e who had three or four thou&s;and miles to &s;ail over,
<PB N="26" REF="015088_0033_0F95E46622CAE028">
before they could attack us; and the &s;ame di&s;tance to return, in order to refit and re|cruit. And although Britain by her fleet, hath a check over our trade to Europe, we have as large a one over her trade to the We&s;t Indies, which, by laying in the neighbourhood of the Continent, lies en|tirely at its mercy."</P>
<P>Were it lawful to joke on &s;o &s;erious an occa&s;ion, I would remind the reader of our Author's mode&s;ty, in &s;aying, "that we claim no foreign dominion:" Since we have the mo&s;t numerous, and be&s;t di&s;ciplin|ed army under the Heaven; and a navy &s;ufficiently &s;trong to combat that of Great Britain. For our pre&s;ent naval armament compo&s;e a fleet more than equal to a twen|tieth part of the Briti&s;h navy, (according to our Author's e&s;timation.) Notwith&s;tand|ing our Author's delicacy, relying on the well known utility of Mela&s;&s;es, to the New-England governments: I hope they will order Admiral Manly to &s;ei&s;e Jamaica, and the other We&s;t India I&s;lands. The Admiral cannot be at a lo&s;s for men; &s;ince, according to our Author, "a few &s;ocial &s;ailors, will &s;oon in&s;truct a &s;ufficient num|ber of active land-men, in the common work of a &s;hip. I do indeed confe&s;s, that the Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, are con&s;tantly
<PB N="27" REF="015088_0034_0F95E466E23318B0">
equipt altogether with very &s;ocial &s;ailors; and as con&s;tantly drub the French &s;hips, double mann'd, with active landmen, tho' &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed by a few <HI>&s;ocial &s;ailors.</HI> The reader will perceive, that our Author, has humbled the naval power of Britain, with more facility, than France and Spain could have done: And, has al&s;o expelled her from our ports with happier &s;ucce&s;s, than did Spain; who was compelled to yield her Gibralter and Portmahon, for the con|veniency of her fleets and commerce.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t indeed allow, that Spain, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Mexico and Peru, cannot maintain the mo&s;t numerous and be&s;t di&s;ci|plined army under Heaven, nor equip a navy fit to contend with the fleets of Bri|tain. It mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;&s;ed, that he makes Great Britain, very favourably di&s;|po&s;e of her humbled navy; by employing nineteen parts of it in the Mediterranean, A&s;ia, Africa, and I know not where: When he knows we have &s;o great a check on her We&s;t India trade, a commerce, of the la&s;t importance to her.</P>
<P>I would blu&s;h for poor human nature, did I imagine that any man, other than a bigot could believe the&s;e ridiculous &s;tories, the&s;e arrant ga&s;conades, re&s;pecting our numerous and be&s;t di&s;ciplined army under heaven,

about our navy, and a few &s;ocial &s;ailors, and that France and Spain will not a&s;&s;i&s;t us, (who by-the-by, according to our au|thor, are able to conquer them,) until playing upon words, we declare our&s;elves INDEPENDENT. Can a rea&s;onable being for a moment believe that Great Britain, who&s;e political exi&s;tence depends on our con&s;titutional obedience, who but ye&s;terday made &s;uch prodigious efforts to &s;ave us from France, will not exert her&s;elf as powerfully to pre&s;erve us from our frantic &s;chemes of Independency. Can we a mo|ment doubt, that the Sovereign of Great Britain and his mini&s;ters, who&s;e glory as well as per&s;onal &s;afety depends on our obe|dience, will not exert every nerve of the Briti&s;h power, to &s;ave them&s;elves and us from ruin.</P>
<P>"Much &s;ays our author has been &s;aid of the &s;trength of Britain and the Colonies, that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world; but this is mere pre&s;umption, the fate of war is uncertain."</P>
<P>Excellent rea&s;oning, and truly con&s;i&s;tent with our author. We of our&s;elves are a match for Europe, nay for the world; but in junction with the mo&s;t formidable power on earth; why then, the matter is mere pre&s;umption. The fate of war is un|certain,

It is indeed humiliating to con&s;i|der, that this author &s;hould vamp up a form of government, for a con&s;iderable part of mankind; and in ca&s;e of its &s;ucceeding, that he probably would be one of our ty|rants, until we prayed &s;ome more illu&s;tri|ous tyrant of the army, to &s;purn him to his primeval ob&s;curity; from all his ill-got honours flung, turned to that dirt from whence he &s;prung. "A government of our own, is our natural right," &s;ays our au|thor, "had right decided, and not fate the cau&s;e, Rome had pre&s;erved her Cato and her laws." Unfortunately for man|kind, tho&s;e are fine &s;ounding words, which &s;eldom or ever influence human affairs. If they did, in&s;tead of appropriating the va|cant lands to &s;chemes of ambition, we mu&s;t in&s;tantly deputi&s;e envoys to the Indians, praying them to re-enter their former po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and permit us quietly to depart to the country of our ance&s;tors, where we would be welcome gue&s;ts. But continues our author, "What have we to do with &s;etting the world at defiance? our plan is commerce, and that well attended to, will &s;ecure us the peace and friend&s;hip of all Europe. Becau&s;e it is the intere&s;t of all Europe, to have America a free-port, her trade will always be her protection, and

her barrenne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver, will &s;e|cure her from invaders."</P>
<P>I am perfectly &s;ati&s;fied, that we are in no condition to &s;et the world at defiance, that commerce and the protection of Great Bri|tain will &s;ecure us peace, and the friend&s;hip of all Europe. But I deny, that it is the intere&s;t of all Europe, to have America a free port, unle&s;s they are de&s;irous of depopulating their dominions. His a&s;&s;ertions, that bar|renne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver will &s;ecure us from invaders, is indeed highly plea&s;ant, have we not a much better &s;ecurity from inva&s;ions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the mo&s;t numerous and be&s;t di&s;ciplined army under heaven; or has our author al|ready di&s;banded it.

The princes of Europe have long dreaded the migration of their &s;ubjects to America; and we are &s;en&s;ible, that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia is &s;aid more than once to have hanged Newlanders, or tho&s;e who &s;educed his &s;ubjects to emi|grate.

Can we &s;uppo&s;e it to be her intere&s;t to lo&s;e her va|luable commerce to the Colonies, which effectually &s;he would do, by giving up A|merica to become your free port.

that the Briti&s;h navy, la&s;t war, carried about &s;eventeen thou&s;and guns; and up|wards of ninety five thou&s;and &s;ocial &s;eamen."No country (&s;ays our Author) is &s;o hap|pily &s;ituated, or internally capable of rai&s;ing a fleet as America.

A third rate &s;hip of the line fitted for &s;ea, is allowed to co&s;t &s;eventy four thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which at the pre&s;ent exchange, is about one hundred and twenty nine thou&s;and pounds. Now, as labour, &s;ail cloth, cordage, and other re|qui&s;ites, are dearer than in Europe, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e the advanced price, at twenty-five per cent. which makes the amount one hundred and fifty four thou&s;and pounds. We mu&s;t next &s;uppo&s;e our navy equal to that of France; which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixty four &s;hips of the line (fifty gun &s;hips inclu&s;ive) twenty five frigates, with &s;hips of inferior force. In ca&s;e of independence, we cannot admit a &s;maller naval force.

With excellent management, our navy would la&s;t eight, nine, or ten years: we therefore would find it extremely conve|nient to rebuild it con&s;tantly at the expira|tion of that term: Of this there cannot be a doubt, when we remember with our Au|thor, "that &s;hip-building is America's greate&s;t pride. The va&s;t empire of Ru&s;|&s;ia is almo&s;t &s;hut out from the &s;ea, where|fore her boundle&s;s forre&s;ts, her tar, iron, and cordage, are only articles of commerce."

Who can doubt the ability of Spain to build a navy. The cargo of two or three of her annual galeons were &s;ufficient to build a navy as formidable as that permitted to Great Britain (by the Author of Common Sen&s;e.)

<P>We do indeed confe&s;s our&s;elves doubtful on this head, and therefore wi&s;h our Author had produced his authority.

This a&s;&s;ertion is as ab&s;urd, as if he had maintained, that twenty is in|ferior in number to two. "But the in|juries and di&s;advantages we &s;u&s;tain by that connection, are without number, and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to our&s;elves, in&s;truct us to renounce the al|liance.

The princes of Eu|rope are or ought to be convinced by &s;ad experience, that the objects of conque&s;t, are va&s;tly inadequate to the immen&s;e charge of their armaments. Prudential motives, therefore, in future, will often dictate ne|gociation, in&s;tead of war.

In this ca&s;e we really do not par|ticipate a twentieth part of the mi&s;ery and hard&s;hips of war, experienced by the other &s;ubjects of the empire. As future wars will probably be carried on by Britain in her proper element, her &s;ucce&s;s will hardly be doubtful, nor can this be thought audacity, if we remember the great things effected by Britain in her naval wars, then &s;econdary objects to her Germanic Con|nections, to which &s;he now politically &s;eems indifferent. Our &s;ailors navigating our ve&s;&s;els to the We&s;t Indies during war, are exempted from impre&s;&s;ment, and if our trade to any part of Europe is then &s;tag|nated, it flows with uncommon rapidity in the We&s;t Indies, nor is the object of cap|tures incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Our author &s;urely forgets that when in|dependent, we cannot trade with Europe,

without political connections, and that all treaties made by England or other com|mercial &s;tates are, or ought to be, ulti|mately &s;ub&s;ervient to their commerce. "But (&s;ays our author,) admitting that matters were now made up what would be the event? I an&s;wer, the ruin of the Conti|nent, and that for &s;everal rea&s;ons."

The happine&s;s of the governed is without doubt the true intere&s;t of the gover|nors, and if we aim not at independence, there cannot be a doubt of receiving every advantage relative to laws and commerce that we can de&s;ire.

"In military numbers, the an|cients far exceeded the moderns, and the rea&s;on is evident, for trade being the con&s;e|quences of population, men become too much ab&s;orbed thereby, to attend to any thing el&s;e, commerce dimini&s;hes the &s;pirit both of patrioti&s;m, and military defence."</P>
<P>Every man of &s;en&s;e, now rejects the fabulous numbers of the army of Xerxes, and other fabled armies of antiquity. The ancient armies, did not exceed in numbers the armies of the moderns. If &s;o, their &s;tates had been de&s;olated by the horrid carnage of their battles, ari&s;ing from the military &s;pirit of defence, from the nature of their arms, and the arrangement of their armies, which permitted the combatants to buckle together, who &s;eldom gave quarter. The Roman armies never exceeded twen|ty-five legions, which including auxiliaries, did not exceed two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and, a number greatly inferior to the armies of France or perhaps Britain during war. Notwith&s;tanding my ardour for li|berty, I do mo&s;t fervently pray, that we may ever exchange the &s;pirit of com|merce, for that of military defence, even at the price of augmenting our armies. Let us hear the te&s;timony of Monte&s;quieu in favour of commerce: "Commerce &s;ays

he, is a cure for the mo&s;t de&s;tructive pre|judices, for it is almo&s;t a general rule, that wherever we find agreeable manners, there commerce flouri&s;hes. Let us not be a&s;toni&s;hed then, if our manners are now le&s;s &s;avage than formerly. Commerce has every where diffu&s;ed a knowledge of all nations, the&s;e are compared one with another, and from this compari&s;on ari&s;e the greate&s;t advantages. Peace is the na|tural effect of trade, &amp;c." The Athenian people, perhaps the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of an|tiquity, did not long po&s;&s;e&s;s a commer|cial &s;pirit, but were almo&s;t continually af|flicted by this &s;pirit of military defence. The common people in effect di&s;tributed the public revenues among&s;t them&s;elves, while the rich, were in a &s;tate of oppre&s;|&s;ion. According to Ly&s;ius the orator and others, it was their cu&s;tom, when in want of money, to put to death &s;ome of the rich citizens, as well as &s;trangers, for the &s;ake of the forfeiture. In &s;hort, could we enumerate the infinite train of misfortunes inflicted on mankind, in every clime and age by this &s;elf-&s;ame &s;pirit of military de|fence; our readers would &s;urely join us in opinion, that commerce has mo&s;t hap|pily humanized mankind.

again&s;t commerce, the&s;e I have ever re|garded as trials of wit, rather than &s;erious productions. Our author's antipathy, and extreme aver&s;ion to commerce, is ea&s;ily accounted for. If his independence takes place, I do aver, that commerce will be as u&s;ele&s;s, as our &s;earching for the philo&s;o|pher's &s;tone. "And hi&s;tory (&s;ays he,) &s;uf|ficiently informs us, that the brave&s;t at|chievements were always accompli&s;hed in the non-age of a nation." The Greeks in their early &s;tate were pirates, and the Ro|mans robbers and both warred in character. Their glorious actions were performed, (if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf) in the man|hood of their empire.

"It is unrea|&s;onable continues (our author) to &s;uppo&s;e that France and Spain will give us any kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if we mean only to make u&s;e of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the purpo&s;e of repair|ing the breach, and &s;trengthening the con|nection between Britain and America; be|cau&s;e tho&s;e powers would be &s;ufferers by the con&s;equences."</P>

The manner of his prevailing on France and Spain to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, is al&s;o a &s;trong proof of his in&s;anity. Did tho&s;e powers, he&s;itate to &s;uccour the Scotch rebels in 1745, becau&s;e they did not declare them&s;elves independent. It then was their intere&s;t to create a diver&s;ion, alas! too &s;erious in the &s;equel for the de|luded rebels in that kingdom; and were they now intere&s;ted in aiding us; they un|doubtedly would do it in &s;pite of quibbles.

This al&s;o is a conclu|&s;ive proof of our Author's maniacum deli|rium. Our Author "challenges the warm|e&s;t advocate for reconciliation to &s;hew a &s;in|gle advantage this Continent can reap, by being connected with Great Britain. I repeat the challenge, not a &s;ingle advantage is derived: Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe:" Were the Author's a&s;&s;ertions re&s;pecting our power, as real as delu&s;ive; a reconciliation on liberal princi|ples with Great Britain, would be mo&s;t excellent policy. I wave &s;imilarity of man|ners, laws, and cu&s;toms, mo&s;t friendly indeed to perpetual alliance. The greate&s;t part of our plank, &s;taves, &s;hingles, hoops, corn, beef, pork, herrings, and many other articles, could find no vent, but in the Engli&s;h I&s;lands. The demand for our flour would al&s;o be con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened. The Spa|niards have no demand for the&s;e articles; and the French little or none.

<P>Britain is al&s;o better calculated to &s;upply us, with woollen goods and other nece&s;&s;ary articles, than any kingdom in Europe. Should a &s;eparation en&s;ue; Britain will open an ex|ten&s;ive commerce to the Baltick, and Ru&s;&s;ia, for all, or many of the commodities, &s;he now receives from us. The Ru&s;&s;ians, &s;ince their la&s;t glorious treaty with the Port; can now export the commodities of their mo&s;t fertile Ukraine, through the Mediterranean, until that period, they were con&s;trained to carry their hemp, eight or nine hundred miles to the Baltick, whence by a long and dangerous navigation, it reached the dif|ferent ports in the Atlantic. I need not in|form the reader that &s;uch immen&s;e land carriage, precluded the &s;ubjects of Ru&s;&s;ia from rai&s;ing wheat, which generally &s;old in the Ukraine for ten-pence per bu&s;hel, as did rye at five-pence, in that exten&s;ive re|gion, than which no country on earth is more happily adapted for that grain.

As our Author is &s;o violently bent again&s;t reconciliation; he mu&s;t either &s;uppo&s;e a con&s;tant war with the incen&s;ed power of England; or admit that he is a proper inha|bitant of the domains of Ario&s;to, (the world in the moon) Now, admitting "we have the mo&s;t numerous, and be&s;t di&s;ciplined army under Heaven; and a navy formidable for that of England;" pray, what are our re&s;ources to pay &s;uch con&s;iderable armaments? Al|though I do not wi&s;h to mortify my countrymen; I mu&s;t acknowledge, that the neat proceeds of all our produce is inadequate to that end.

Our author affirms "that our trade will always be our protec|tion." I therefore crave his pardon, and &s;hall believe, that the &s;ight of our grain, and &s;mell of the New England Codfi&s;h, will effectually &s;erve as a Mediterrannean pa&s;s, to the piratical rovers. I do humbly con|fe&s;s my &s;u&s;picions, lea&s;t Portugal extremely dependent on Great Britain, may not in|&s;ult us.

The author of Common Sense confidently affirms, "that our trade will always be its protection."

It now behoves us well to con&s;ider, whether it were better to enter the harbour of peace with Great Britain, or plunge the &s;hip into all the horrors of war.&mdash;Of civil war. As peace and a happy ex|ten&s;ion of commerce, are objects infinitely better for Great Britain; than war and a di|minution of her commerce. It therefore is her intere&s;t to grant us every &s;pecies of indulgence, con&s;i&s;tent with our con&s;titu|tional dependence, &s;hould war continue, there can be no doubt of the annihilation of our &s;hips, ports and commerce, by Great Britain. The King's &s;hips now in New England, unhappily are more than &s;ufficient to ruin the ports and commerce of the&s;e provinces. New York is already &s;ecured; and I &s;hould be extremely grieved to hear, that a &s;mall armament, were de&s;tined a|gain&s;t Philadelphia. In the opinion of the be&s;t officers of the navy; Philadelphia is acce&s;&s;ible to a few forty and fifty gun &s;hips, in de&s;pite of our temporary expedients to fortify the river Delaware. If &s;uch opinion is groundle&s;s, the mini&s;try by their imbecil|lity have befriended us; &s;ince by guarding the River Delaware with a few frigates on|ly;

they had precluded us from arming our ve&s;&s;els and &s;trengthening the river Delaware. I would remind our author of the con&s;tant language, and apparent purport of all ranks in oppo&s;ition to Great Britain: "We have (&s;ay they) been the happie&s;t people on earth, and would continue to be &s;o, &s;hould Great Britain renounce her claim of taxation. We have no &s;ini&s;ter views, we claim not independence; No! Peri&s;h the thought." Such I believe al&s;o was the tenor of the petitions from the Congre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty. Now I would a&s;k every man of &s;entiment, what opinion our friends in Great Britain, nay the whole world will entertain of us, if ingratefully, and madly adopting our author's frantic &s;chemes, we reject rea&s;onable terms of reconciliation? Will they not mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly believe, that our popular leaders, have by infinite art, de|luded the unwary people into their pre-con|certed &s;chemes; on &s;uppo&s;ition, <HI>that the time had found us?</HI> Tho&s;e acquainted with Bri|tain mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the minority in par|liament, hitherto have been our main prop.

<P>I &s;hall no longer detain my reader, but conclude with a few remarks on our Author's &s;cheme. The people of tho&s;e Colonies would do well to con&s;ider the character, fortune, and de&s;igns of our Author, and his independents; and com|pare them with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t amiable and venerable per&s;onages in, and out of the Congre&s;s, who abominate &s;uch nefarious mea&s;ures. I would humbly ob&s;erve, that the &s;pecious &s;cience of politics, is of all others, the mo&s;t delu&s;ive. Soon after the Revolu|tion; the able&s;t &s;tates-men in England, and other parts of Europe; confidently

predicted National ruin, infallible ruin, &s;oon as the Public debt exceeded fifty millions &s;terling. The Nation now indebt|ed nearly thrice that &s;um; is not arrived at the zenith of her credit and power. It is perhaps po&s;&s;ible to form a &s;pecious &s;y&s;tem of government on paper which may &s;eem practicable, and to have the con&s;ent of the people; yet it will not an&s;wer in practice, nor retain their approbation upon trial. "All plans of government (&s;ays HUME) which &s;uppo&s;e great reformation in the man|ners of mankind, are merely imaginary."</P>
<P>The fabricators of Independency have too much influence; to be entru&s;ted in &s;uch ar|dous and important concerns. This rea&s;on alone, were &s;ufficient at pre&s;ent, to deter us from altering the Con&s;titution.

Nor is this &s;entiment unnatural, if we are atten|tive to con&s;tant experience, and human na|ture. The &s;ublime MONTESQUIEU, &s;o aptly quoted by the Congre&s;s, unhappily corrobo|rates our doctrine, "from (&s;ays he) a man|ner of thinking that prevails among&s;t man|kind. They &s;et a higher value upon cou|rage than timorou&s;ne&s;s, on activity than pru|dence, on &s;trength than coun&s;el. Hence, the army will ever de&s;pi&s;e a &s;enate, and re|&s;pect their own officers. They will natu|rally &s;light the order &s;ent them by a body of men whom they look upon as cowards, and therefore unworthy to command them, &s;o that as &s;oon as the army depends on the legi&s;lative body, it becomes a military one;" and if the contrary has ever happened, it has been owing to &s;ome extraordinary cir|cum&s;tances, &s;uch as Holland being able to drown her garri&s;ons, and the Venetians having it in their power to compel their troops to obedience by the vicinity of the European armies.

Even in vain would our Author; or our CROMWELL cheri&s;h toleration; for the people of New-England, not yet arrived in the &s;eventeenth or eighteenth century, would reprobate her.&mdash;It is more than pro|bable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the New-England go|vernments would have no objection to an Agrarian law; nor is it unrea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, that &s;uch divi&s;ion of property would be very agreeable to the &s;oldiers. Indeed their General could not perhaps with &s;afety to his exi&s;tence as a General, refu&s;e them &s;o rea&s;onable a gratification, particularly, as he will have more than one occa&s;ion for their &s;ervices.

<P>THE town has been lately amu&s;ed with a new political pamphlet, entitled COMMON SENSE.</P>
<P>This piece, though it has taken a popu|lar name, and implies that the contents are obvious, and adapted to the under&s;tandings of the bulk of the people is &s;o far from meriting the title it has a&s;&s;umed, that in my opinion it holds principles equally in|con&s;i&s;tent with learned and common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>I know not the author, nor am I anxious to learn his name or character; for the book, and not the writer of it, is to be the &s;ubject of my animadver&s;ions.</P>
<P>'Tis the glory of a free country to enjoy
<PB N="68" REF="015088_0075_0F95E48BA2B427C0">
a free pre&s;s, and of this, that the &s;enti|ments and opinions of the meane&s;t, equally with tho&s;e of the greate&s;t, are brought to view; for we know by frequent in&s;tances, that the rich and high born are not the monopolizers of wi&s;dom and virtue.&mdash;On the contrary, the&s;e qualities are oftener to be found among the middling cla&s;s in every country, who, being le&s;s di&s;&s;ipated and debauched than tho&s;e who are u&s;ually cal|led their betters, apply them&s;elves with more indu&s;try to the culture of their under|&s;tandings, and in reality become better ac|quainted with the true intere&s;ts of the &s;o|ciety in which they live.</P>
<P>But to my great grief I have too often &s;een in&s;tances of per&s;ons in every cla&s;s of life, who&s;e publications, at the &s;ame time they have reflected honor on the parts and genius of the authors, have been &s;o &s;hamefully wanting in candor as to attempt, by the cadence of words, and force of &s;tile, a to|tal perver&s;ion of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The pamphlet in que&s;tion &s;eems to be plainly calculated to induce a belief of three things.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the Engli&s;h form of government has no wi&s;dom in it, and that it is by no means &s;o co&s;tructed as to produce the happine&s;s
<PB N="69" REF="015088_0076_0F95E48C63E08E18">
of the people, which is the end of all good government.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That monarchy is a form of govern|ment incon&s;i&s;tent with the will of God.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That now is the time to break off all connection with Great Britain, and to de|clare an independence of the Colonies.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be obvious to every impartial eye, that the author rea&s;ons from the abu&s;es of, again&s;t the benefits derived from, the En|gli&s;h con&s;titution; and after reciting the&s;e abu&s;es concludes, very unfarily, that "it is incapable to produce what it &s;eems to promi&s;e."&mdash;For if an argument of this &s;ort is to be received, it will prove perhaps ra|ther more than the author would chu&s;e&mdash;it would even prove that the Jewi&s;h theo|cracy was quite as improper, and as inca|pable to produce what it aimed at, as the reprobated Engli&s;h government.&mdash;The re|cords of &s;acred hi&s;tory inform us, that the law was given to the people from God, and that the great Jehovah him&s;elf conde|&s;cended to call them his <HI>cho&s;en people.</HI> He &s;ignally interpo&s;ed in their behalf in bring|ing them out of bondage, in pre&s;erving them from the rage of Pharoah's army, and &s;eating them in a land flowing with milk and honey, under his immediate goven|ment

and laws, "written with his own finger."</P>
<P>"And he will love thee and ble&s;s thee, and multiply thee: he will al&s;o ble&s;s the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land, thy corn and thy wine, and thy oil; the increa&s;e of thy kine, and the flocks of thy &s;heep, in the land which he &s;ware unto thy fathers to give thee". Deut. vii. 13.</P>
<P>"Thou &s;halt be ble&s;&s;ed above all people, there &s;hall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle." Deut. vii. 14.</P>
<P>But what effects did all the&s;e extraordina|ry favors and promi&s;es of the Deity him&s;elf produce upon that wicked, perver&s;e, &s;tiff-necked people? Mo&s;es tells them,</P>
<P>"From the day that thou did&s;t depart out of the land of Egypt until ye came un|to this place, ye have been rebellious a|gain&s;t the Lord." Deut. ix. 7.</P>
<P>"You have been rebellious again&s;t the Lord from the day that I knew you." Deut. ix. 24.</P>
<P>Profane as well as &s;acred hi&s;tory informs us of the inneffectuality of the be&s;t govern|ments and the wi&s;e&s;t laws among a corrupt, degenerate people. It does not regularly

follow, that if the people are not happy under an excellent form of civil polity, that the fault is in the government, it may be owing to the corruption of the people, and this I take to be the ca&s;e in Great Britain at this day. When the Briti&s;h parliament is properly balanced, and each branch of the legi&s;lature faithfully executes its duty, I think I am &s;afe in affirming there was never yet a form of government in the world &s;o well calculated for the happine&s;s of a free people as this, and yet we are told by the author of the pamphlet, that the "preju|dice of Engli&s;hmen in favor of King, Lords and Commons, ari&s;es as much or more from national pride than rea&s;on." The world has already &s;een numberle&s;s in&s;tances of fine &s;pun political theories, which, like the quackeries of mountebank doctors, are to cure all the political evils to which hu|man nature is liable.&mdash;But when the expe|riment is made, they become a&s;toni&s;hed at the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their boa&s;ted &s;chemes&mdash;they find a thou&s;and little pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts continually interfering with their de&s;igns, and at length retire again to their clo&s;ets, chagrined they had not thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy the great volume of human nature, before they ventured to &s;ay what was the be&s;t for mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="015088_0079_0F95E48EA6302F20">
The author, after venting his &s;pleen a|gain&s;t the Engli&s;h form of government, comes next to con&s;ider the &s;ubject of mo|narchy and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; in treat|ing which he plainly di&s;covers the utmo&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favor of a republic. I &s;hall not follow him through his &s;cripture quo|tations, which he has &s;o carefully garbled to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, but beg leave to op|po&s;e &s;ome authorities to it.</P>
<P>The celebrated Trenchard, in No. 60, of Cato's Letters, &s;ays, "There is no go|vernment now upon earth, which owes its formation or beginning to the immediate revelation of God, or can derive its exi&s;t|ence from &s;uch revelation: It is certain, on the contrary, that the ri&s;e and in&s;titution, or variation of government, from time to time, is within the memory of men or of hi&s;tories; and that every government which we know at this day in the world, was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the wi&s;dom and force of mere men, and by the concurrence of cau&s;es evidently human."</P>
<P>"Nor has God by any revelation nomi|nated magi&s;trates, &s;hewed the nature or ex|tent of their powers, or given a plan of ci|vil polity for mankind." (Hutche&s;on's Moral Philo&s;ophy. p. 272.)</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="015088_0080_0F95E48F62AAC950">
<HI>There being no natural or divine law for any form of government,</HI> or that one per&s;on rather than another &s;hould have the &s;overeign admini&s;tration of affairs, or have power over many thou&s;and different families who are by nature all equal, being of the &s;ame rank, promi&s;cuou&s;ly born to the &s;ame advantages of nature, and to the u&s;e of the &s;ame com|mon faculties, therefore <HI>mankind is at liber|ty to choo&s;e what form of government they like".</HI></P>
<P>"God's providence or permi&s;&s;ion &s;uffered his own peculiar people the Jews to be un|der divers governments at divers times; as fir&s;t under patriarchs. Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, &amp;c. then under judges, Othniel, Ehud and Gideon; then under high-prie&s;ts, Eli and Samuel; then under kings, Saul, David and the re&s;t; then under captains and high prie&s;ts again, "as Zerobabel, Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren; and the government was la&s;tly taken from them, and they brought under the power of Rome. And that God permits &s;uch ma|gi&s;trate or magi&s;trates as the community thinks fit to approve, is plain by the te&s;ti|mony of Holy Scriptures; when God &s;aid to Solomon, "By me kings rule, even all the judges of the earth." Prov. viii. 16.</P>
<P>"When the &s;ons of Samuel were judges over I&s;rael, they took bribes and perverted

judgment, therefore the elders of I&s;rael de|&s;ired Samuel to make them a king; and though the elders are only mentioned to have a&s;ked a king of Samuel, they &s;eem to have been deputed from the whole con|gregation; for God &s;aid unto Samuel, <HI>"Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they &s;ay unto thee."</HI> I Sam. viii. 4, 7.</P>
<P><HI>"And Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord.</HI> 1 Sam. x. 25. 'Tis plain the manner of the kingdom &s;ignifies the con&s;titution of the government, by which was meant the conditions on which Saul was to be king, and they his &s;ubjects; for though <HI>God had given him the crown,</HI> it was to rule the people according to ju&s;tice and laws."</P>
<P>"After the battle between Saul and the Ammonites, Samuel &s;aid to the people, <HI>Come, let us go to Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">gal; and there they made Saul king before the Lord.</HI> 1 Sam. xi. 1. 5, 6, 7. 14. 15. <HI>Now therefore behold the king, whom ye have cho&s;en, and behold the Lord hath &s;et a king over you."</HI> Sam. chap. 12. 13.</P>
<P>The&s;e latter quotations are taken from the great Lord Somers's book called the "judg|ment of whole Kingdoms and Nations con|cerning the Rights of Kings and the People." This nobleman was Lord High chancellor of England in King William's reign, and
<PB N="75" REF="015088_0082_0F95E490E7EEEE50">
was remarkable for his revolution-prin|ciples, great learning and un&s;haken inte|grity, in public and private life.</P>
<P>It does therefore from the foregoing te&s;|timonies appear, that monarchy (e&s;pecially a limited one, &s;uch as that of England) is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Holy Scriptures, as is &s;et forth in &s;aid pamphlet, but that it is as plea&s;ing to the Almighty, if agreeable to the people, as any other form of govern|ment, even the author's beloved republic.</P>
<P>The writer next proceeds to inform his readers of the numerous wars and &s;cenes of blood acted in England under their kings, and a&s;&s;erts that <HI>"Monarchy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion have laid the world in blood and a&s;hes. 'Tis a form of government which the word of God bears te&s;timony again&s;t, and blood will attend it."</HI> Here are bold a&s;&s;ertions indeed. To the latter part I have already endeavoured to make &s;ome reply, &s;o far as he a&s;&s;erts it is contrary to the word of God; but will the author's candor permit him to inform his reader of the infinite di&s;tractions and mi&s;|chiefs which have happened in the ancient and modern republics&mdash;Under this form there are always two parties, which divide the whole body of the people, and an eter|nal warfare &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them for power. The <HI>Conte&s;t</HI> is dreadful enough, but which &s;oever party <HI>prevails,</HI> there is no rod heavy
<PB N="76" REF="015088_0083_0F95E491A8EA2EA0">
enough, no &s;word &s;ufficiently &s;harp, to puni&s;h tho&s;e whom they have &s;ubdued.&mdash;It then becomes a many headed mon&s;ter, a tyranny of many.</P>
<P>Let any man read with an unprejudiced eye the accounts which hi&s;torians give us of the famous Grecian Commonwealths, and I will venture to &s;peak for him, that he will not be&s;tow great commendations on them&mdash;The Athenians a wi&s;e and po|li&s;hed people, very often bani&s;hed their be&s;t citizens, from an apprehen&s;ion of their power&mdash;a glorious reward for a virtuous citi|zen, who, as was the ca&s;e in more in&s;tances than one, had pre&s;erved his country from de&s;truction. In the latter times of the Cartha|ginian and Roman republics, what con&s;tant &s;cenes of blood and deva&s;tation does hi&s;tory pre&s;ent to us&mdash;The multitude in a perpetual ferment like the ocean in a &s;torm&mdash;In a &s;torm did I &s;ay,&mdash;like the waters of the &s;ea, agitated by a dreadful whirlwind, no|thing but the fury of one party encounter|ing the rage of another.&mdash;Every trace of hu|manity being thus lo&s;t, men change their natures and become as fierce and &s;avage as wolves and tygers.</P>
<P>But let us de&s;cend nearer to modern times&mdash;let us look for happine&s;s and &s;ecuri|ty in the republic of Holland, &s;o often men|tioned, and &s;o little known&mdash;let us recol|lect

the fate of the two brothers, Cornelius and John de Wit, Dutch mini&s;ters, who were ma&s;&s;acred by the people in the year 1672. Holland it&s;elf, from being a repub|lic, is become a downright ari&s;tocracy. Liberty did not continue long in that coun|try, notwith&s;tanding the blood and trea&s;ure that were expended to acquire it. The people, &s;o far from being free, have had no voice for many years pa&s;t in the election of per&s;ons to repre&s;ent them in the States-Ge|neral, nor have they any thing to do in the forming of laws by which they are to be governed. Whenever one of them dies, the vacancy is filled up without any inter|ference of the people, and this important change was made in the &s;tate, becau&s;e of the intolerable feuds and animo&s;ities which attended the elections of repre&s;entatives. Had they been to have cho&s;en a king, what dangerous and de&s;tructive tumults mu&s;t it have produced. Founded on the woeful ex|perience of ages, it is now become a gene|ral fixed opinion, that hereditary is prefer|able to elective monarchy, on account of the terrible di&s;orders, outrages and confu|&s;ion which u&s;ually attend the election of a king; a pregnant in&s;tance of which, in our times, is the kingdom of Poland.</P>
<P>In our own hi&s;tory, we &s;ee what was the effect of the much wi&s;hed for Common|wealth

<P>I cannot agree with the author of the pamphlet in opinion, that this is the time to declare an independence of the Colonies. This ought to be the dernier re&s;ort of America. Let us not yet lo&s;e &s;ight of the primary object of the di&s;pute, namely, a &s;afe, honorable, and la&s;ting reconciliation with Great Britain, until we are under a nece&s;&s;ity of doing it. If an advantageous accommodation can be had, and a free con&s;titution for this country be e&s;tabli&s;hed on mutual agreement and compact, 'twill be better and happier for us. But if ju&s;tice is &s;till denied us, and we are to contend for liberty by arms, we will meet them in the field, and try our manhood again&s;t them, even to &s;pilling the blood of every brave man we have. Should the mini&s;try have recour&s;e to foreign aid, we may po&s;&s;ibly follow their example; and, if it be e&s;&s;ential then to our &s;afety to declare an Independence, I would willingly embrace the nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT from the &s;econd Letter to the People of Penn&s;ylvania; being that part of it which relates to INDEPENDENCY. By a WRITER under the Signature of CATO.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the whole, it appears that this writer (Ca&s;&s;andra) is more an enemy to the bu&s;ine&s;s on which the Commi&s;|&s;ioners are to be &s;ent, than really apprehen&s;ive for our virtue. He &s;eems to have drank deep of the <HI>cup of independency;</HI> to be inimical to whatever carries the appearance of <HI>peace;</HI> and too ready to &s;acrifice the happine&s;s of a great continent to his favourite plan. Among &s;uch writers I pretend not to cla&s;s my&s;elf; for I am bold to declare, and hope yet to make it evident to every hone&s;t man, that the true intere&s;t of America lies in <HI>re|conciliation</HI> with Great-Britain, upon <HI>con&s;titu|tional principles,</HI> and I can truly &s;ay, I wi&s;h it upon no other terms.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="015088_0087_0F95E49627980838">
Why the many publications in favour of <HI>independency,</HI> with which our pre&s;&s;es have lately groaned, have pa&s;&s;ed hitherto unno|ticed, I am not able to determine. But there are certainly times when public affairs become &s;o intere&s;ting, that every man be|comes a debtor to the community for his opinions, either in &s;peaking or writing. Perhaps it was thought be&s;t, where an <HI>ap|peal</HI> was pretended to be made to the COM|MON SENSE of this country, to leave the people for a while to the free exerci&s;e of that good under&s;tanding which they are known to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Tho&s;e who made the <HI>appeal</HI> have little cau&s;e to triumph in its &s;ucce&s;s. Of this they &s;eem &s;en&s;ible; and, like true quacks, are con&s;tantly pe&s;tering us with their additional do&s;es, till the &s;tomachs of their patients begin wholly to revolt. If little notice has yet been taken of the pub|lications concerning independence, it is neither owing to the popularity of the doc|trine, the unan&s;werable nature of the argu|ments, nor the fear of oppo&s;ing them, as the vanity of the authors would &s;ugge&s;t. I am confident that nine-tenths of the people of Penn&s;ylvania yet abhor the doctrine.</P>
<P>If we look back to the origin of the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, it will appear that &s;ome
<PB N="81" REF="015088_0088_0F95E496DB03D520">
among us at lea&s;t, have been con&s;tantly en|larging their views, and &s;tretching them beyond their fir&s;t bounds, till at length they have wholly changed their ground. From the claim of Parliament to tax us, &s;prung the fir&s;t re&s;i&s;tance on our part. Be|fore that unju&s;t claim was &s;et on foot, not an individual, not one of all the profound legi&s;lators with which this country abounds, ever held out the idea of independence. We con&s;idered our connection with Great-Britain as our chief happine&s;s&mdash;we flouri&s;h|ed, grew rich, and populous, to a degree not to be paralleled in hi&s;tory. Let us then act the part of &s;kilful phy&s;icians, and wi&s;e|ly adapt the remedy to the evil.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome men may have harboured the idea of independence from the begin|ning of this controver&s;y. Indeed it was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected there were individuals who&s;e views tended that way; but as the &s;cheme was not &s;ufficiently ripened, it was reckoned &s;landerous, inimical to America, and what not, to intimate the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pi|cion of this kind.</P>
<P>Nor have many weeks yet elap&s;ed &s;ince the fir&s;t open propo&s;ition for independence was publi&s;hed to the world.&mdash;By what men
<PB N="82" REF="015088_0089_0F95E49796629B28">
of con&s;equence this &s;cheme is &s;upported, of whether by any, may po&s;&s;ibly be the &s;ubject of future enquiry&mdash;Certainly it has no coun|tenance from the Congre&s;s, to who&s;e &s;enti|ments we look up with reverence. On the contrary, it is directly repugnant to every declaration of that re&s;pectable body. It would be needle&s;s to quote particular pa&s;&s;ages in proof of this, as they are to be met with in almo&s;t every page of their proceedings. I will refer to a few only, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> their Re&s;olves, March 5, 1775&mdash;their Declaration, July 6&mdash;heir Addre&s;s to the King, July 8&mdash;their Letter to the Lord Mayor of London&mdash;and more e&s;pecially their Declaration for a fa&s;t, June 12 in which with the deepe&s;t marks of &s;incerity they call upon all America to join with them in addre&s;&s;ing the great Go|vernor of the World&mdash;<Q>humbly be&s;eech|ing him to avert the de&s;olating judgments with which we are threatened, to ble&s;s our rightful &s;overeign, &amp;c.&mdash;that &s;o America may &s;oon behold a gracious in|terpo&s;ition of Heaven for the redre&s;s of her many grievances, the re&s;toration of her invaded rights, and reconciliation with the parent &s;tate, on terms con|&s;titutional and honorable to both.</Q></P>

Will any one be &s;o hardy as to &s;ay, that either the appointment or ob&s;ervation of this &s;olemn day was a mere mockery of Heaven and Earth, or even that any Ameri|can joined in it, who was not &s;incere?&mdash;I tru&s;t not. But if multiplying authorities were of any u&s;e, I might add the &s;entiments of our own Repre&s;entatives in a&s;&s;embly, expre&s;|&s;ed in the in&s;tructions to their Delegates; the &s;entiments of Maryland in &s;imilar in|&s;tructions; the Re&s;olves of New Jer&s;ey and New-Hamp&s;hire; nor &s;hall the much injur|ed province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay be left out of the catalogue; who&s;e Provincial Congre&s;s, while yet bleeding with the wounds receiv|ed at Lexington, thus addre&s;&s;ed the inhabi|tants of Great Britain&mdash;<Q>The&s;e are marks of mini&s;terial vengeance again&s;t this Colony, but they have not yet detached us from our royal Sovereign, &amp;c. tru&s;ting that in a <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> connexion with the mother country, we &s;hall &s;oon be a free and happy people.</Q> The&s;e were the &s;entiments of the Colony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, &s;igned by that great Martyr to Liberty, Dr. WARREN, and &s;oon after &s;ealed with his blood.</P>
