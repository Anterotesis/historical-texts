<P>And he &s;aid, draw not nigh hither. Put off thy Shoes from off thy Feet, for the Place whereon thou &s;tande&s;t is holy Ground.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;upreme KING of Heaven and Earth, being re&s;olved to deliver his cho&s;en People the Jews then in Bondage, was plea&s;ed to employ his meek Servant Mo&s;es, as a proper In&s;trument to procure their Enlargement: In Con&s;equence of this Determination, he conde&s;cended to appear before him, in a miraculous and augu&s;t Manner, ON THE <HI>Mountain</HI> OF GOD.</P>
<P>MOSES was alarmed at &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing an Appearance: And well he might, when he beheld a Bu&s;h on fire, and yet not de&s;troyed by that con&s;uming Element, which has no Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, or Places, but with mercile&s;s Fury, too often reduces the proude&s;t Palaces to A&s;hes, and lays the Work of Ages, as it were, in a Moment, level with the Ground.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;overeign LORD beheld the Anxiety with which his cho&s;en Servant was &s;eized, out of Compa&s;&s;ion to him, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>Draw not nigh hither.</HI> Con&s;ider before whom thou appeare&s;t, and pre&s;erve a proper and an awful Di&s;tance. <HI>Put off thy Shoes from off thy Feet.</HI> The
<PB N="2" REF="010231_0005_0F7DB5BDDE8589A0">
Maje&s;ty of Heaven is now the Subject of thy Obedience and Reverence; therefore, revere him that covers thee with the radiant Beams of his Glory; and in Token of Re&s;pect, <HI>Put off thy Shoes from off thy Feet, for the Place whereon thou &s;tande&s;t is holy Ground.</HI></P>
<P>THE ALMIGHTY con&s;ecrated this Mountain by his e&s;pecial Pre&s;ence. The Ground which before was no more holy than common, is now, from being vi&s;ited by the LORD OF LORDS, become holy Ground.</P>
<P>IT is very obvious to all pre&s;ent, that the Intention of our pre&s;ent Meeting is, to dedicate this beautiful <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Paul's Chapel.</NOTE> Edifice, to the Service of THE SUPREME BEING. It cannot therefore be deemed an improper Undertaking to &s;hew;</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, THAT ALMIGHTY GOD is eminently pre&s;ent in one Place, more than in another; and therefore, that &s;uch Place, with great Propriety, may be called holy.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, THAT CHURCHES dedicated to the ALMIGHTY's Service, may be ju&s;tly looked upon as &s;uch Places.</P>
<P>FROM whence will appear,</P>
<P N="3">3dly, THE Obligations which we are under, while in &s;uch a Situation, and in the more immediate Pre&s;ence of &s;o holy a GOD, of behaving with Re&s;pect, Reverence, and Devotion.</P>
<P>FIRST, then, I am to &s;hew you, That ALMIGHTY GOD is eminently pre&s;ent in one Place, more than in another; and therefore that &s;uch Place, with great Propriety, may be called HOLY.</P>
<P>TO Mankind, in their pre&s;ent lap&s;ed Condition, the divine Pre&s;ence is invi&s;ible. We can form no adequate Idea of the Likene&s;s of GOD. The mo&s;t &s;oaring Imagination mu&s;t fall infinitely &s;hort of SUPREME EXCELLENCE, &s;hould it be vain enough to attempt to de&s;cribe it. <HI>No Man,</HI> &s;aith the great Apo&s;tle to the Gentiles, <HI>hath &s;een, or can &s;ee</HI> GOD <HI>at any Time.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="010231_0006_0F7DB5BE73222238" MS="y">THE JEWS, his cho&s;en People, tho' ble&s;&s;ed with the SHEKINAH, or Glory of GOD, never &s;aw any Similitude <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Shekinah</HI> was the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Mark of the Pre&s;ence of GOD, which was to be ob&s;erved among&s;t the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and which re&s;ted upon the Propitiatory, or over the golden Cherubims, which adhered to the Propitiatory, or the Covering of the Ark: There the <HI>Shekinah</HI> abode in the Shape of a Cloud. It was from thence that GOD gave forth his Oracles with an articulate Voice, when he was con&s;ulted by the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> in Favour of the People. Thence it is, that it is often &s;aid in Scripture, that GOD <HI>&s;its</HI> upon the Cherubims, or between the Cherubims; <HI>that is to &s;ay</HI>; That he gives the mo&s;t evident Tokens of his <HI>Divine Pre&s;ence,</HI> by an&s;wering from hence the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> that con&s;ulted him. The <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbins</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Shekinah</HI> fir&s;t re&s;ided in the Tabernacle prepared by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s, and that it de&s;cended thereon on the Day of its Con&s;ecration, in the Figure of a Cloud. It pa&s;&s;ed from thence into the Sanctuary of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>Temple,</HI> on the Day of its Dedication by that Prince, where it continued 'til the De&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and of the Temple, by the <HI>Chaldeans</HI>; and was not afterwards to be &s;een there. <HI>Calmet</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;torical,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Dictionary of the Holy Bible. Vol.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI></NOTE>; nay, the <HI>divine E&s;&s;ence</HI> is undi&s;cernable even to the holy Angels above. Tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Spirits, tho' they inhabit cele&s;tial Abodes, po&s;&s;e&s;s a Space; their Nature, therefore, mu&s;t greatly differ from that immen&s;e BEING, the pure Fountain from whence flows every Perfection, the GOD that pervadeth univer&s;al nature.</P>
<P>THAT ALMIGHTY BEING, then, that reared the mighty Fabrick of the Univer&s;e, <HI>dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands:</HI> The <HI>Heaven of Heavens,</HI> the &s;pacious Concave above, <HI>is not able to contain Him, for he filleth Heaven and Earth.</HI> His Limits are not to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>BUT, though ALMIGHTY POWER is not to be fully a&s;certained, yet certainly it may be exerted in a vi&s;ible and extraordinary Manner, on particular Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>TRANSCENDENT MAJESTY, arrayed in Glory, can certainly di&s;play him&s;elf in a more con&s;picuous Manner in one Place, than in another. This is evident from Facts.</P>
<P>IN our pre&s;ent imperfect State, much of our Knowledge is received by our Sen&s;es. To inve&s;tigate the mo&s;t ab&s;tracted Ideas, we call to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Helps. The benevolent CREATOR of the human Race, intimately acquainted with the fallen Nature of Man, has, upon particular Occa&s;ions, conde&s;cended to exhibit to the World, a kind of vi&s;ible Pre&s;ence, of his tremendous MAJESTY. His wi&s;e and gracious
<PB N="4" REF="010231_0007_0F7DB5C000A40448" MS="y">
Intention in thus acting, is to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Thoughts in our Minds, as may plant the Principles of our mo&s;t holy Religion deep and la&s;ting in our Souls.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that a Being endued with <HI>omnipotent Power,</HI> can upon a particular Occa&s;ion, actuate a Quantity of Matter, in &s;uch a Manner, as mu&s;t fill the Mind of Man, with great and a&s;toni&s;hing Ideas of his <HI>Meje&s;ty.</HI> His Power being infinite; <HI>He is able to do among the Inhabitants of the Earth, as well as in the Armies of Heaven, whatever he wills.</HI></P>
<P>IN former Ages, the <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, for wi&s;e and good Purpo&s;es, conde&s;cended to exhibit a&s;toni&s;hing Repre&s;entations to particular Men, in particular Places. The&s;e glorious and magnificent Signs were generally di&s;covered by a remarkable luminous Appearance, bur&s;ting forth from dark and thick Clouds.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Appearance of the Glory of the <HI>Lord</HI> that we have recorded, was to <HI>Adam,</HI> in Paradi&s;e. After our fir&s;t Parent had &s;tained his Soul with Guilt, his ju&s;tly offended GOD, appeared to him, arrayed with awful Maje&s;ty; and with a commanding Voice, that pierced through his guilty Brea&s;t, he called the unhappy and &s;elf-convicted Criminal.</P>
<P>THUS arraigned by his <HI>Sovereign Lord,</HI> he was &s;eized with Fear and Dread. In vain he attempted to hide him&s;elf from the Pre&s;ence of injured MAJESYT.</P>
<P>AFTER the Flood, the SHEKINAH was often vi&s;ible to the HOLY SEED; particularly to the venerable Father of the Faithful; for it is &s;aid, that GOD <HI>went up</HI> from <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN JACOB returned from BEERSHEBA, towards HARAN, to mitigate incen&s;ed ESAU's Re&s;entment, he was ble&s;&s;ed with the <HI>Divine Pre&s;ence. He beheld the Angels of God a&s;cending, and de&s;cending, and viewed the Lord of Glory,</HI> who promi&s;ed that his wakeful Providence &s;hould watch over him for good.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="010231_0008_0F7DB5C0D3D40CC0">WELL might the pious PATRIARCH break forth, and in a religious Rapture &s;ay, <HI>&s;urely the Lord is in this Place. How dreadful is this Place. This is no other than the Hou&s;e of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven.</HI> And on his Return to his Native Country, <HI>he</HI> (&s;ay the &s;acred Scriptures) <HI>wre&s;tled with God and prevailed</HI>; and in Honor of &s;o &s;ignal an Event, called the Place where he obtained the ble&s;&s;ing, PENIEL; that is, <HI>the Face of God</HI>; becau&s;e he was there favoured with the <HI>Divine Pre&s;ence.</HI> After this the &s;ame augu&s;t <HI>Being</HI> was plea&s;ed to di&s;play his Glory to his faithful Servant MOSES; and <HI>God called unto him.</HI></P>
<P>AND le&s;t the Vain, the proud Sceptic, &s;hould &s;ay, that the&s;e particular Men were deluded, and di&s;turbed with Melancholy and Whim; the Spirit of Divine Wi&s;dom has al&s;o recorded the <HI>Almighty</HI>'s appearing to Multitudes infamous for the hardne&s;s of their Heart. Hear MOSES's &s;olemn and awful Account of it, dictated by the holy <HI>Spirit of God. On the third Day in the Morning there were Thunders and Lightnings, and a thick Cloud upon the Mount, and Mo&s;es brought forth the People out of the Camp to meet with God; and Mount Sinai was altogether in a Smoke, becau&s;e the Lord de&s;cended upon it; and the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the Top of the Mount.</HI></P>
<P>THUS it is very evident that <HI>Almighty God</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Imaginations of Men, by his miraculous Pre&s;ence; not that the <HI>Godhead</HI> was repre&s;ented to them, for that is invi&s;ible; but he conde&s;cended to exhibit to his cho&s;en People, &s;uch glorious, and amazing appearances, and &s;uch vi&s;ible Signs, as convinced them of his invi&s;ible Pre&s;ence, and readine&s;s to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>BY illu&s;trating the Manner in which <HI>Almighty God</HI> eminently appeared in one Place, more than another, we &s;hall be able to put the Truth now advanced in a proper Point of Light. And,</P>
<P>FIRST, tho&s;e Per&s;ons to whom <HI>the Glory</HI> of the <HI>Lord appeared,</HI> were them&s;elves fully per&s;uaded of the Reality of the <HI>Divine Pre&s;ence.</HI> If Men are endued with &s;uch valuable Faculties as to know GOD, to &s;erve Him,
<PB N="6" REF="010231_0009_0F7DB5C171971950" MS="y">
and to be directed by Him; they then are al&s;o capable of knowing when <HI>infinite Wi&s;dom</HI> conde&s;cends in a particular Manner to reveal him&s;elf to them. The Fountain from whence all Knowledge is derived, &s;o enlightened their Under&s;tandings to whom the <HI>Shekinah</HI> appeared, as convinced them by a Demon&s;tration from the Spirit of GOD, that it was no le&s;s than <HI>the Glory of the Lord</HI> that appeared. Nor is &s;uch a <HI>Divine Illumination</HI> either incon&s;i&s;tent with the Perfections of <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, or tho&s;e noble Faculties with which he has ble&s;&s;ed the Sons of MEN.</P>
<P>ABRAHAM, the Father of the Faithful, was fully convinced that the GOD who had often appeared to him, was the &s;ame BEING that commanded him to &s;acrifice his only beloved Son ISAAC. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that &s;o good and wi&s;e a Man, &s;o fond and indulgent a Parent, could be tempted to commit an Action, that had &s;o much the Appearance of being barbarous, unnatural and Irreligious, had he not received the mo&s;t ample Conviction, that it was the expre&s;s Command of his GOD, to whom he owed intire Obedience.</P>
<P>JACOB entertained not the lea&s;t Su&s;picion but that it was GOD, that appeared to him at BETHEL. The <HI>Divine Pre&s;ence</HI> amply &s;upplied tho&s;e Cnveniencies which he wanted, and rendered his Couch of Earth and Stones va&s;tly preferable to the Down and Ti&s;&s;ue of Princes.</P>
<P>MOSES, that eminent Servant of GOD, would not have <HI>hid his Face,</HI> and been &s;eized with Fear, not daring to look up, if he had not been fully per&s;uaded, that the <HI>Divine Maje&s;ty</HI> appeared to him in Glory at that preci&s;e Time.</P>
<P>AND, to mention but one In&s;tance more; the &s;tiff-necked ISRAELITES, remarkable for Infidelity and Perver&s;ene&s;s, would never have moved, and &s;tood afar off, and conde&s;cended to reque&s;t MOSES to <HI>&s;peak unto them le&s;t they &s;hould die</HI>; would not have <HI>wor&s;hiped every Man at his Tent-Door,</HI> when they beheld the cloudy Pillar &s;tanding at the Door of the Tabernacle, if
<PB N="7" REF="010231_0010_0F7DB5C455BDB068" MS="y">
they had not received inconte&s;table Evidence that the <HI>Divine Pre&s;ence</HI> was in a &s;pecial Manner <HI>there.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, The Supreme Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth always appeared with a&s;toni&s;hing Splendor, and amazing Glory, on particular Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>AT tho&s;e times, to make u&s;e of the &s;ublime and grand De&s;cription, which the &s;acred Oracles give us, <HI>There went up a Smoke out of his No&s;trils; Fire came out of his Mouth: He bowed the Heavens, and came down; Darkne&s;s was under his Feet; He rode upon a Cherub, and did fly; He came flying upon the Wings of the Wind. At the Brightne&s;s that was before him, thick Clouds pa&s;&s;ed away. The Sight of the Glory of the Lord was like devouring Fire, in the Eyes of the Children of</HI> I&s;rael. And, it is recorded that, <HI>when</HI> GOD <HI>came up from</HI> Teman, <HI>and the Holy One from</HI> Mount Paran, <HI>that his Glory covered the Heavens, and the Earth was full of his Prai&s;e. His Brightne&s;s was as the Light.</HI> Nay, &s;o tran&s;cendently glorious was the Splendor of the Divine <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> that it even dazzled the Eyes of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> though permitted to talk with his GOD, <HI>Face to Face.</HI> Again;</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Almighty</HI> might command the greate&s;t Reverence, when he graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to leave the beautiful Man&s;ions of Glory, and to vi&s;it the Sons of Men, (amazing Conde&s;cen&s;ion indeed:) He was attended by a &s;plendid Company of active Angels. <HI>The Ancient of Days,</HI> &s;ays the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> in a noble and lofty Stile, <HI>has Thou&s;ands to mini&s;ter to him, and Ten Thou&s;and Times Ten Thou&s;and &s;tanding before him. The Chariots of</HI> GOD <HI>are Twenty Thou&s;and, even Thou&s;ands of Angels, and the Lord is among them in his holy Place.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the Patriarch <HI>Jacob,</HI> when ble&s;&s;ed with the <HI>Divine Pre&s;ence,</HI> &s;aw the Angels of GOD, attending on the Maje&s;ty of Heaven, <HI>a&s;cending and de&s;cending:</HI> And when the <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD appeared to his Servant <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the <HI>Angel was in the Bu&s;h</HI>; and GOD upon Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> was received by <HI>the Di&s;po&s;ition of Angels.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010231_0011_0F7DB5C513C4CA80">LASTLY, The Place where <HI>the Shekinah, or Glory of the Lord</HI> appeared, was e&s;teemed holy. For if the Tabernacle, the Temple, nay, the meane&s;t Uten&s;il appropriated for Divine Service, was e&s;teemed as holy, &s;urely the Place honoured with the e&s;pecial Pre&s;ence of <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, was eminently &s;o.</P>
<P>FOR this Rea&s;on <HI>Jacob,</HI> when he was fully convinced that GOD appeared to him in <HI>Bethel,</HI> cryed out, <HI>that the Place was dreadful, and that it was the Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD: And GOD declareth to his Servant <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that the Mount on which he appeared to him in Glory, was <HI>holy Ground.</HI> And whenever <HI>the Glory of the Lord</HI> filled the Tabernacle, the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> wor&s;hipped and did Obey&s;ance. The Speciality of the <HI>Divine Pre&s;ence</HI> con&s;ecrating or making tho&s;e Places holy, in which <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD was plea&s;ed to appear.</P>
<P>THUS it is very evident that the <HI>Supreme Being</HI> is eminently pre&s;ent in one Place more than another; therefore that &s;uch Place may, with great Propriety, be &s;tiled holy.</P>
<P>I proceed, <HI>Secondly,</HI> to prove both from Scripture and Antiquity, that <HI>Churches</HI> dedicated to GOD's Service, may be ju&s;tly looked upon as &s;uch <HI>holy Places.</HI></P>
<P>WE do not at this Day pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>e&s;pecial Divine Pre&s;ence</HI> is now vi&s;ible in our Churches.</P>
<P>THE ancient Fathers ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>Shekinah, or the Glory of the</HI> LORD was effected by the <HI>Second Per&s;on</HI> in the &s;acred <HI>Trinity:</HI> It was therefore highly rea&s;onable that, when the <HI>Brightne&s;s of</HI> GOD's <HI>Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on, became manife&s;t in our Fle&s;h</HI>; all tho&s;e extraordinary Appearances &s;hould cea&s;e; and accordingly they have long &s;ince been withdrawn.</P>
<P>BUT though the <HI>Glory of the Lord</HI> is not now vi&s;ible, yet we may rea&s;onably conclude, that the <HI>Sovereign In&s;pector</HI> of Men, and their Actions,
<PB N="9" REF="010231_0012_0F7DB5C58278A508">
has a peculiar Regard for tho&s;e Places dedicated, and &s;et apart, for his <HI>particular Service,</HI> by his religious, and faithful Servants. And, though our Sen&s;es are not &s;truck with tho&s;e radiant Beams of Light, which holy Men, before the Appearance of the <HI>Lord of Light and Glory,</HI> were ble&s;&s;ed with; yet the <HI>Great</HI> GOD, though imperceptible to us, is more eminently pre&s;ent in Places dedicated to his Name and Wor&s;hip, than in common Buildings.</P>
<P>IN all Ages, and among all Nations, we find that particular Places have been appropriated, and &s;et apart for religious Rites and Ceremonies.</P>
<P>JACOB <HI>vowed a Vow, that the Place</HI> where GOD appeared to him, <HI>&s;hould be</HI> GOD's Hou&s;e. And whenever this was done with Piety and Sincerity, the <HI>Supreme</HI> GOD, as an Encouragement to his faithful Servants, was plea&s;ed to declare his Approbation by manife&s;t Signs.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>when</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>fini&s;hed the Work of the Tabernacle, a Cloud covered the Tent of the Congregation, and the Glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle:</HI> And when the magnificent <HI>Temple of Solomon</HI> was fini&s;hed, which for Grandeur, and Refinement of Ta&s;te, exceeded every Thing of the Kind before or &s;ince, <HI>the Cloud,</HI> as a Sign of Approbation, <HI>filled the Hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH our Sen&s;es are not, in the&s;e Days of Degeneracy, &s;truck with extraordinary Appearances for the Rea&s;on already given; yet <HI>we may,</HI> with great Truth, I am confident, pre&s;ume, that <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD will equally delight in every Place, or Church, which the Piety of his obedient Servants, with a View to his Glory, and the pre&s;ent and eternal Welfare of the human Race, has dedicated to Him under the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> as He delighted in tho&s;e dedicated to him under the <HI>Law; He</HI> being the <HI>&s;ame Ye&s;terday, To-day, and for ever.</HI></P>
<P>NOW indeed, neither <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> nor <HI>Mount Gerazim,</HI> are more holy to GOD than other Places; but from <HI>the Ri&s;ing of the Sun to the going down of the &s;ame,</HI> GOD<HI>'s Name &s;hall be great in every Place. Incen&s;e &s;hall be offered in his Name.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010231_0013_0F7DB5C5F5A0E990">THE Goodne&s;s of GOD is not now confined to <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> neither is <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> the Place that <HI>his Holine&s;s delighted to dwell in</HI>; but in every Country his faithful Wor&s;hipers may erect Buildings, and dedicate them to the Service of their GOD and <HI>Redeemer:</HI> And, when ever the <HI>Almighty</HI> is properly invoked in &s;uch Places, or Churches, in Spirit and in Truth, we are a&s;&s;ured that his Votaries perform as acceptable a Service, as was anciently performed in tho&s;e Places called by GOD's &s;acred Name.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to &s;ay, that our Churches have any intrin&s;ic Holine&s;s in them; but, by being &s;olemnly dedicated to the &s;ole Service of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> they certainly have an immediate Relation to Him, and are <HI>derivatively Holy.</HI></P>
<P>BOTH the Laws of GOD and Man require, that the &s;tated Times for the public Wor&s;hip of the GOD that made us, &s;upports and protects us, be ob&s;erved in a different Manner from other Times. Why therefore, by a Parity of Rea&s;oning, &s;hould not hallowed Places, which are appropriated, and dedicated entirely to the Service of <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, be treated with greater Regard than ordinary Hou&s;es?</P>
<P>THE &s;uperb Palace of a <HI>Monarch</HI> is approached and entered with Re&s;pect and Deference; &s;hould not then noble and maje&s;tic Edifices erected for, and dedicated to the Service of that <HI>Sovereign Being,</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Lords,</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Kings,</HI> be treated with the greate&s;t Awe, and mo&s;t profound Veneration?</P>
<P>IF outward Marks of Reverence be not paid to Things belonging unto GOD, in a very &s;hort Time, (&s;uch is our Propen&s;ity to forget our Duty,) we may become &s;o lo&s;t to Decency, and our mo&s;t rea&s;onable Service, that we &s;hall fail in that inward Veneration we yet pretend to have for the <HI>Divine Maje&s;ty Him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation of an eminent Prelate, (long &s;ince with his Maker)
<PB N="11" REF="010231_0014_0F7DB5C77A1AAA10">
that the <HI>inward</HI> Wor&s;hip of the <HI>Heart</HI> is
<Q>the great Service of GOD, and that no Service can be acceptable without it: But, (he proceeds) <HI>the external Wor&s;hip of</HI> GOD in his <HI>Church</HI> is the great Witne&s;s to the World, that our Hearts &s;tand right in his Service.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Church or Temple (&s;ay our Homilies) is counted or called holy, yet not of it&s;elf; but, becau&s;e GOD's People re&s;orting thereunto are holy, and exerci&s;e them&s;elves in holy and heavenly Things.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book Hom. Page <HI>162.</HI></NOTE> But permit me to dwell a little longer on this Subject.</P>
<P>PERSONS and Things when &s;et apart to the peculiar Service of <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, claim a Right to external, and relative Holine&s;s; and this Right is founded on their being thus appropriated.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Sabbath</HI> was called <HI>Holy,</HI> as it was the Day fixed for public Wor&s;hip: Thus the Oil under the Law was called holy, being appropriated to Divine U&s;es: Thus the <HI>Jews</HI> were called an <HI>holy People,</HI> being &s;eparated from the idolatrous Nations by <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD. And our Churches by &s;olemn Dedication become the Hou&s;es of GOD, and &s;o are made holy.</P>
<P>I might now mention many Dedications under the Law, to elucidate what has been &s;aid on this Subject, were it needful; but I rather proceed to ob&s;erve, that after the A&s;cen&s;ion of the <HI>Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> his di&s;con&s;olate Spou&s;e, the Church, was, for &s;ome Time, clad in Mourning, weeping, and afflicted; and his poor per&s;ecuted Servants were &s;o watched by their cruel Enemies, that they were obliged to make U&s;e, not of the mo&s;t decent, but mo&s;t &s;olitary and &s;afe Places, for their Religious A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>STATELY Fabricks, noble and magnificent Edifices, were not then erected. But as mean and &s;olitary as tho&s;e Places were, which were &s;et apart for Divine Wor&s;hip; yet they were treated by the Primitive Chri&s;tians with the greate&s;t Re&s;pect; and the Profanation of them was univer&s;ally dete&s;ted and condemned.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010231_0015_0F7DB5C833A01850">SOME Ages after, the Rage of Per&s;ecution abated, the dark and di&s;mal Cloud, replete with Mi&s;chief and Vengeance, was, by the Interpo&s;ition of Heaven, di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;&s;ipated, and a radiant and glorious Light &s;hone forth. <HI>Kings</HI> gloried in being <HI>nur&s;ing Fathers to the true Church of</HI> GOD. The &s;trong Attachment, the &s;acred Veneration, which the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians had for the Hou&s;es of their GOD, now openly appeared.</P>
<P>THE great and celebrated <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian Emperor,</HI> immediately &s;et about fini&s;hing the Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> built (as profane Hi&s;torians inform us) over our <HI>Saviour's Sepulchre:</HI> And &s;uch was his Sen&s;e of the Propriety and Decency of &s;olemly dedicating it to the &s;ole Service of <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>An.</HI> 335.</NOTE> that he ordered the greate&s;t Part of the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves together for that Purpo&s;e. This they very readily complied with; and &s;ome with Orations, others with Sermons, others with Prayers for the Peace of the World, for the Safety of the Church, and for the Pro&s;perity of the Emperor and his Children, &s;olemnized the Dedication to the be&s;t of their Power. This pious Emperor al&s;o laid the Foundation of a famous Temple, called <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> and <HI>Magna,</HI> which was fini&s;hed, and dedicated Thirty-four Years after, by his Son <HI>Con&s;tantius,</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid <HI>Bingham,</HI> Page <HI>286.</HI></NOTE> who joined the <HI>Temple of Peace</HI> to it, including them both in one.</P>
<P>CONSTANTIUS was followed in his Piety by the &s;ucceeding Emperors, but e&s;pecially by <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> who, among other Works of this Nature, rebuilt the Church of St. <HI>Sophia,</HI> which had been burnt down in the Time of <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Church was ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the Glory of the World, for its Greatne&s;s, curious Architecture, Richne&s;s and Beauty; in&s;omuch that <HI>Ju&s;tinian</HI> him&s;elf having fini&s;hed it, was heard to &s;ay, <HI>I have outdone thee,</HI> Solomon.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="010231_0016_0F7DB5CBA3E1C698">SOCRATES <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">SOCRAT. iii.8.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, that in like Manner the Council of <HI>Antioch</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>An.</HI> 541.</NOTE> was &s;ummoned on Purpo&s;e to dedicate the famous Church there, called <HI>Dominicum Aureum,</HI> which was begun by <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and fini&s;hed by <HI>Con&s;tantius.</HI> Many Examples of the &s;ame Nature are to be met with in profane Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e In&s;tances therefore, of SOLOMON, under the <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> under the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, it plainly appears in what Sen&s;e the CHURCH is &s;aid to be HOLY.</P>
<P>AGAIN; it is called holy, from the &s;acred and &s;olemn Offices that are performed in it. The ble&s;&s;ed JESUS him&s;elf, who always &s;poke the Words of unerring Truth, a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>where two or three are gathered together in his Name,</HI> HE <HI>will be in the mid&s;t of them</HI>; and we cannot doubt but that the <HI>Father of all Mercies,</HI> will al&s;o be pre&s;ent with us in <HI>this Hou&s;e,</HI> now devoted to his Service, by the Influence of his ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT; who is to renew us in the inner Man, to incline us to will and to do what is acceptable to GOD.</P>
<P>WITHIN the&s;e &s;acred Walls, publick Audience is to be given to the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of CHRIST, who preach <HI>the Go&s;pel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things;&mdash;to the Stewards of the My&s;teries of Chri&s;t;&mdash;to the Amba&s;&s;adors of</HI> GOD; who, with repeated Solicitations, <HI>be&s;eech you in</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s Stead, to be reconciled unto</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>IN this elegant <HI>Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD, the Laws of the great JEHOVAH will be promulged;&mdash;Obedience demanded;&mdash;the Rewards that attend the Ob&s;ervance of them, and the great Danger of a contrary Behaviour, laid before you. <HI>Here,</HI> the benevolent CREATOR offers to heal the <HI>broken Spirit, and the contrite Heart</HI>;&mdash;to meet with open Arms the poor, humble, dejected Penitent;&mdash;to receive the &s;incere Petitions of his obedient Servants, and to hearken to their earne&s;t Prayers. Here, at the &s;acred ALTAR, we are to commemorate the Death and Pa&s;&s;ion <HI>of that immaculate Lamb, who was
<PB N="14" REF="010231_0017_0F7DB5CC132FCDE0">
&s;lain for the Sins of an ungrateful World. Here,</HI> we &s;hall fea&s;t upon the Banquet of redeeming Love; and receive the Elements of Bread and Wine, to our great and endle&s;s Comfort. In a Word, <HI>Here,</HI> every Ordinance of our religious Wor&s;hip, for the Advancement of GOD's Glory, and the Honor of his beloved <HI>Son</HI>;&mdash;for the Edification of the <HI>People</HI> of GOD, and promoting the eternal Intere&s;t of our immortal Souls, is required to be piou&s;ly di&s;charged by the Congregation of the Faithful.</P>
<P>WE readily allow that the &s;acred Offices of our mo&s;t holy Religion, may be performed in private Hou&s;es; but it is evident from the Prayer at the Dedication of <HI>Solomon's Temple,</HI> that religious Services performed in the <HI>Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD are more effectual in removing Judgments, and procuring Mercies, than tho&s;e offered in private Places. The Goodne&s;s of the LORD never &s;hines with a greater Lu&s;tre, than when the united Devotions of his faithful Servants, wre&s;tle as it were with the ALMIGHTY in his own Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>WE find that our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR paid particular Re&s;pect to Places dedicated to the Service of GOD. The &s;acred JESUS coming to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> was filled with a pious Indignation at &s;eeing his <HI>Father's Hou&s;e</HI> vilely pro&s;tituted. When his <HI>Per&s;on</HI> was treated in the mo&s;t cruel and ungrateful Manner, he bore it with wonderful Patience; but when the <HI>Temple of</HI> GOD was prophaned, an holy Zeal in&s;tantly kindled in his Brea&s;t. The meek Lamb of GOD, thus provoked, had Recour&s;e to holy Violence, and whipped the impious Merchants out of the Temple. But,</P>
<P>LASTLY, If particular Edifices or Places are thus made holy, then many are the Obligations that <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> are under of behaving, while in &s;uch a Situation, and in the more immediate Pre&s;ence of ALMIGHTY GOD, with the greate&s;t Re&s;pect, Reverence and Devotion.</P>
<P>WHETHER we reflect on the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> or our Relation to GOD, our Judgments mu&s;t be fully convinced, that it is our rea&s;onable Service,
<PB N="15" REF="010231_0018_0F7DB5CD415CA9D0">
and our undoubted Intere&s;t, to rejoice to enter into the <HI>Hou&s;e of the</HI> LORD, and there &s;erve him in the <HI>Beauty of Holine&s;s.</HI> GOD's Service is now perfect Freedom; the <HI>Yoke of</HI> CHRIST <HI>is ea&s;y, and his Burden light.</HI> It is not now required of us <HI>to come before</HI> GOD <HI>with Calves of a Year old; to pre&s;ent Thou&s;ands of Rams, or Ten Thou&s;and Rivers of Oil; much le&s;s to give our fir&s;t born for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, the Fruit of our Bodies, for the Sin af our Souls</HI>; but we are required to &s;acrifice our Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>to &s;erve the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, <HI>with all our Hearts, and with all our Souls,</HI> &amp;c. and to become <HI>new Creatures</HI> in CHRIST JESUS. Can we po&s;&s;ibly attain this ble&s;&s;ed and de&s;irable End by any Means &s;o likely, as a con&s;tant Attendance at the <HI>Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD;&mdash;the <HI>Place where his Honour dwelleth?</HI></P>
<P>THE Royal P&s;almi&s;t, with the mo&s;t ardent Affection, <HI>longed to enter into the Courts of the</HI> LORD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He wi&s;ely e&s;teemed them completely ble&s;&s;ed, who dwelt in the <HI>Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD. <HI>One Day in his Courts he e&s;teemed better than a Thou&s;and:</HI> Therefore, the <HI>one Thing he de&s;ired</HI> was, <HI>that he might dwell in the Temple of the</HI> LORD <HI>all the Days of his Life.</HI></P>
<P>IF the <HI>Law,</HI> which made nothing perfect, thus &s;trongly influenced that holy Man, how inexcu&s;eable then mu&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tians be,</HI> if they now neglect the invaluable Means of Salvation offered them in the <HI>Go&s;pel?</HI> Unpardonable mu&s;t they be, if they now refu&s;e daily to walk with GOD, and <HI>reverence his Sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, barely to frequent the <HI>Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD, will not &s;anctify our Natures, and render us amiable in the Sight of &s;o pure a <HI>Being,</HI> unle&s;s we behave while in his Courts, with the mo&s;t inten&s;e Fervency and Devotion.</P>
<P>"BEFORE we enter the Church, &s;ays <HI>St. Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> we mu&s;t dive&s;t our&s;elves of the Care of this World. Let no Man (he goes on) enter with a troubled and di&s;tracted Mind; let him lay all the&s;e down at the Doors, and &s;o let him come. For coming thither, we come to Heaven, not in re&s;pect of the Place indeed, but of the Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of our
<PB N="16" REF="010231_0019_0F7DB5CD7478E838">
Minds; for a Man while he lives on Earth, may a&s;cend to Heaven, and take a View of the Things that are there: Let no Man therefore, in the Church, think of his dome&s;tic Affairs; but on the contrary, while he is yet at Home, let him begin tho&s;e Things he is to do in the Church."</P>
<P>THE like was ob&s;erved among the very <HI>Heathens.</HI> They had their <HI>Nudipedalia Sacra</HI>; and they put off their Shoes when they entered the Temple of <HI>Apollo.</HI> And Hi&s;tory informs us, that the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Ethiopian Chri&s;tians</HI> do not go into their &s;acred A&s;&s;emblies, but with their Feet naked. This was the ancient Way of expre&s;&s;ing Reverence and Re&s;pect, as uncovering the Head is, at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>DOCTOR CAVE, in his primitive Chri&s;tianity, &s;ays, "that the pious Chri&s;tians came into the Church as into the Palace of the GREAT KING, with Fear and Trembling. Nay, the Emperors them&s;elves, when they went into the <HI>Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD, left their Guards behind them, and took off their Crowns, in Token of that high Re&s;pect they paid to Hou&s;es dedicated to the Service of <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD."</P>
<P>LET modern Chri&s;tians then follow the&s;e Examples. Let us <HI>wor&s;hip the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, <HI>fall down and kneel before him.</HI> When we reflect where we are, we mu&s;t be lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of Goodne&s;s, if we neglect to &s;erve our <HI>Creator</HI> with Reverence and goldy Fear. Let us endeavour to form ju&s;t Ideas of the awful <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> of the <HI>Heavenly</HI> KING. Let us be properly impre&s;&s;ed with a Sen&s;e of our own Unworthine&s;s, and then we &s;hall be induced to approach the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> with Lowline&s;s, Reverence and Devotion. Can we reflect that the <HI>Lord</HI> is certainly in this Place, and be wanting in our Endeavours to order our Affections, and regulate our Actions, in &s;uch a becoming Manner, as that no Thought of the Mind, or Ge&s;ture of the Body, may render us unfit to appear before &s;o great and powerful an <HI>In&s;pector?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010231_0020_0F7DB5CECD8DAA60">EXTERNAL Reverence greatly promotes the Intere&s;t of Religion, and mu&s;t convince all but the Abandon'd and Ob&s;tinate, that our GOD <HI>is among us of a Truth.</HI> GOD <HI>is greatly to be feared in the A&s;&s;embly of his Saints, and to be had in Reverence of all them that are round about him.
