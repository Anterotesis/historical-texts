<HEAD>What think ye of the <HI>CONGRESS</HI> Now? OR, An ENQUIRY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t &s;acred and invaluable rights of Engli&s;h|men, and con&s;equently of the inhabitants of his Ma|je&s;ty's American colonies, is <HI>the liberty of the pre&s;s.</HI> By this is meant the liberty of publi&s;hing, by means of the pre&s;s, remarks upon, objections to, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of, all public tran&s;actions, whether relating to religion or government. Every Engli&s;hman claims this liberty as his birth-right: the law has made it a part of his property; none can deprive him of it without his con&s;ent; it is not even in his own power to alienate it; and he ought in duty to exerci&s;e this right, as often as he thinks his communications would be of &s;ervice to the public.</P>
<P>The <HI>liberty of the pre&s;s</HI> is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of &s;oci|ety in general, that the late <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> in their <HI>Addre&s;s to the in|habitants of</HI> QUEBEC, mention it as one of tho&s;e
<Q>rights, without which a people cannot be free and happy, and under the protecting and encouraging influence of which, the&s;e co|lonies have hitherto &s;o amazingly flouri&s;hed and increa&s;ed.</Q>
They complain that the King's "<HI>profligate</HI> mini&s;try," are en|deavouring to wre&s;t it from us, and declare their re&s;olution not to re&s;ign it but with their late&s;t breath.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="013866_0003_0F925D5347005008">It is a pity that the&s;e generous Patrons and Defenders of Ame|rican liberty <HI>forgot</HI> in their <HI>Memorial to the inhabitants of the</HI> con|federated <HI>Colonies,</HI> to take notice of what &s;o greatly concerned them; and that they did not place &s;ome guard for the &s;ecurity of a right, which was deemed by them &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the freedom and happine&s;s of Americans; and which, they knew, was in &s;ome danger of being violated and trampled upon by a &s;et of people, who&s;e views were more contracted, who&s;e &s;entiments were le&s;s generous, and who&s;e zeal was more dimly enlighten|ed than their own. To this unlucky omi&s;&s;ion we mu&s;t a&s;cribe it, that even <HI>the Sons of Liberty,</HI> of the lower and more illibe|ral cla&s;&s;es, are perpetually running counter to the &s;entiments of the <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> in &s;triving to intimidate writers, and printers, and readers, and &s;peakers, and thinkers, on the &s;ide of govern|ment.</P>
<P>One of <HI>their</HI> ways of confuting pamphlets, like the old popi&s;h way of confuting heretics, is by fire and faggot. This proceeds from the &s;ame bigotry, and is dictated by the &s;ame &s;pirit, which commonly di&s;graced the dark ages preceding the Reformation. And when the&s;e burning zealots a&s;&s;emble together, in order to hold an <HI>Auto de Fe,</HI> I advi&s;e all dealers in political here&s;y, to take care of them&s;elves. And in general, I advi&s;e all writers of unpopular pieces to keep their own &s;ecrets, as we know not what revolutions may happen.</P>
<P>For &s;hould the writers in behalf of peace, order and govern|ment be certainly known, or only &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected, and &s;hould the nominal <HI>Sons of Liberty,</HI> but the <HI>real</HI> Sons of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, Faction and Confu&s;ion, be in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that power which they are &s;triving to obtain; there is rea&s;on to believe, that the <HI>writers</HI> and their <HI>writings</HI> would be both con&s;umed together in the &s;ame fire.</P>
<P>For thus &s;ays <HI>Holt,</HI> in his <HI>Journal</HI> of November 24, &s;peaking of &s;ome of our <HI>beer-hou&s;e</HI> gentry, who a&s;&s;embled on occa&s;ion of a new publication:
<Q>It was with <HI>one con&s;ent</HI> concluded, to treat the pamphlet (the <HI>Farmer</HI>'s FREE THOUGHTS, &amp;c.) as it <HI>was thought the</HI> AUTHOR DESERVED <HI>to be treated</HI>; and it was <HI>accordingly committed to the flames!</HI></Q>
This is fine. It &s;hews the &s;pirit of the times; and clearly intimates what kind of law and go&s;pel may be expected, if ever we &s;ubmit to the do|minion of &s;uch <HI>Sons of Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>But yet of &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in this province, I think there can be no danger. The pretended <HI>Sons of Liberty</HI> here, have already pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of their power and importance. The eyes of my countrymen and fellow-citizens begin, at la&s;t,
<PB N="5" REF="013866_0004_0F925D5763677DE8">
to be opened to their true intere&s;t and happine&s;s. They have been witne&s;&s;es of a long train of &s;uch infamous abu&s;es of, and in&s;ults upon, true con&s;titutional Liberty, as they think are un|&s;ufferable. And the time is ha&s;tening on, when men will not only venture to write and &s;peak their own &s;entiments, but, in &s;pite of Comittee-men, to eat and drink as they plea&s;e, without any other re&s;traint than that of the laws.</P>
<P>In the mean while, under &s;uch protection as our legal con|&s;titution can at pre&s;ent afford me, and (which is much more) under the &s;anction and au&s;pices of the late Congre&s;s, who <HI>vir|tually guaranteed</HI> to all Americans the <HI>Liberty of the Pre&s;s</HI>; I &s;hall proceed, in the exerci&s;e of &s;o beneficial and e&s;&s;ential a right, to <HI>diffu&s;e</HI> &s;ome
<Q>liberal &s;entiments on the admini&s;tration of go|vernment,</Q>
among&s;t my countrymen, relating to a matter of the utmo&s;t importance to all the Americans; I mean, the late "admini&s;tration of government" by the <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In what is now to be offered to the public, I mean to avoid all per&s;onal reflexions upon the members of the Congre&s;s; for I never had any per&s;onal objections to any of them. Some of them are men for whom I have a peculiar regard, and who are generally e&s;teemed for many excellent qualities. If I &s;hould therefore happen to &s;peak of our own Delegates, or of the De|legates in general, di&s;re&s;pectfully; and yet I here pledge my&s;elf to the public that I will not &s;peak of them &s;o di&s;re&s;pectfully, as they them&s;elves &s;peak of the King and Parliament; the reader will be kind enough to remember, that what is thus &s;poken, is it to be con&s;trued as &s;poken, of them, not in their private or per&s;onal, but their <HI>congre&s;&s;ional</HI> capacity. A man's private cha|racter may be amiable, while his public proceedings are odi|ous. Thus, for in&s;tance, it is allowed, both by friends and foes, that there is not a more amiable and worthy character in the kingdom, in private life, than that of the King's pre&s;ent <HI>Prime Mini&s;ter</HI>; and yet no mon&s;ter can be more dete&s;ted, than his Lord&s;hip is in his public character, by our American pa|triots.</P>
<P>In order to form a right judgment of the Proceedings of the late Congre&s;s, we ought to recollect the occa&s;ion of its appoint|ment; which, if I mi&s;take not, was this. The peace and hap|pine&s;s of the American colonies had been, for &s;ome time, in|terrupted and di&s;turbed, by certain acts of the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment, laying re&s;trictions upon our trade, and impo&s;ing duties on &s;ome articles of our commerce; and it was thought nece&s;|&s;ary to the re&s;toration of peace and happine&s;s among us, to ob|tain a repeal of tho&s;e acts, and &s;ome proper &s;ecurity that we
<PB N="6" REF="013866_0005_0F925D5967910B28">
&s;hould not be di&s;turbed again by acts of a &s;imilar nature. As the colonies were circum&s;tanced, it required the mo&s;t prudent management and addre&s;s to gain &s;o important a point; for it was apparent, that a &s;mall degree of mi&s;conduct would defeat the whole purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s was therefore taken out of the hands of the people, who&s;e imprudence already had much injured the cau&s;e; and it was committed to the conduct of a few Gentlemen of di&s;tinction and character, in who&s;e wi&s;dom, integrity and ho|nour the greate&s;t confidence was repo&s;ed. The exerci&s;e of par|liamentary power, in impo&s;ing what we called <HI>taxes</HI> upon us, was the evil complained of by the American colonies; to re|move this evil, and not to increa&s;e it, was con&s;equently the commi&s;&s;ion with which our Delegates were ve&s;ted.</P>
<P>And had they attended to the nature and de&s;ign of their commi&s;&s;ion, and acted according to it, no one would have thought it expedient to que&s;tion their authority. The fomentors of our di&s;turbances would have been under peculiar obligations to acquie&s;ce in their determinations; and I am &s;ure that the friends of peace would all have exerted them&s;elves to give full force and efficacy to them.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the Gentlemen of the Congre&s;s have &s;o widely mi&s;taken their proper bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;ince the whole tenor of their proceedings was calculated to increa&s;e the evil, which they were &s;ent to remove; it has become nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>inquire,</HI> previou&s;ly to our entering into more particular di&s;putes, <HI>how far the colo|nies are bound to abide by, and to execute the deci&s;ions of, the late Congre&s;s?</HI> For though they &s;peak in a high and ab&s;olute tone, and undertake
<Q>&s;olemnly to bind them&s;elves and their con&s;ti|tuents;</Q>
yet there is room to que&s;tion, whether, in &s;uch a cour&s;e of proceedings, they were able to bind any but them|&s;elves. But &s;uppo&s;ing they were able to bind their <HI>con&s;tituents,</HI> that is, the per&s;ons who gave their votes for &s;ending them to the Congre&s;s; yet, be it remembered, that a very great part of the Americans are not their <HI>con&s;tituents</HI> in any &s;en&s;e at all, as they never voted for them, nor ever &s;ignified any approbation of their acting in behalf, and in the name, of the colonies.</P>
<P>Before I proceed farther, I think proper, in order to remove prejudices again&s;t what may be offered, to declare, (regard it who will) that I am not con&s;cious of being under the influence of any mercenary or private motives. I have no ambition, nor re&s;entment, nor envy, nor jealou&s;y, nor ill-will, that I can propo&s;e to gratify by writing. I feel my&s;elf warmly affected to the happine&s;s of mankind in general, and of my
<PB N="7" REF="013866_0006_0F925D5A16FA2038">
pre&s;ent countrymen in particular; and I &s;incerely wi&s;h, that all Americans may enjoy as much liberty, of every kind, as is con&s;i&s;tent with good order and &s;afety.</P>
<P>I do al&s;o farther declare, hone&s;tly and candidly, that I think the <HI>policy</HI> of &s;ome of the late acts, re&s;pecting the colonies, to have been wrong;&mdash;that we do not enjoy all the privileges of Engli&s;hmen, while we give no kind of con&s;ent to the laws that govern us;&mdash;and, that it is time that we were exempted, in a regular way, from parliamentary taxation, on &s;ome generous and equitable plan.</P>
<P>But then it is but fair, on the other hand, to declare my belief, that the Americans, with their own <HI>free con&s;ent,</HI> were originally placed under the ab&s;olute authority of the Engli&s;h Parliament;&mdash;that they never yet have been legally exempted from it;&mdash;that they have neither right nor ability to exempt them&s;elves;&mdash;and that they never can be properly exempted, but by the generous and friendly conce&s;&s;ions of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now examine the grand que&s;tion, Whether the Ame|ricans are bound to abide by, and to execute the deci&s;ions of, the late Congre&s;s, or not. And here it is allowed, that &s;o far as we could <HI>lawfully</HI> authori&s;e them, and in reality <HI>did</HI> authori&s;e them, to act, and &s;o far as they acted agreeably to their commi&s;|&s;ion, their proceedings are undoubtedly binding upon us.</P>
<P>But then, if they either departed from their commi&s;&s;ion, or if their commi&s;&s;ion was unlawful in any degree, &s;o far their proceedings can lay no obligation upon any of their con&s;tituents. Thus, if I empower a per&s;on to do for me &s;ome particular act, that act when done is binding upon me; but if the per&s;on ex|ceeds his commi&s;&s;ion, and does in my name &s;ome other act, it is at my own option whether I will abide by it or not. Thus again, if the commi&s;&s;ion I give him be invalid, or contrary to law,&mdash;it conveys no power, and all that is done in virtue of it, is ineffectual. There can be no difference in the ca&s;e, where the parties are a number of per&s;ons jointly concerned.</P>
<P>Whether the late Congre&s;s was an a&s;&s;embly &s;trictly lawful or not, I &s;hall not now take time to enquire. For the pre&s;ent I will <HI>&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> that it was, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, materially lawful; and that no objections could properly be made to it till it acted illegally. It is one of the undoubted privileges of Engli&s;hmen to <HI>petition,</HI> in ca&s;es of grievance; and con&s;equently to meet together for &s;ettling the &s;ub&s;tance and forms of petitions, under certain pre&s;cribed regulations. Yet, by the way, what right the Americans have to plead the privilege of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> any more than the privilege of Dutchmen, if they are not in full
<PB N="8" REF="013866_0007_0F925D5B20349160">
&s;ubjection to the authority of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> let tho&s;e who can, &s;hew.</P>
<P>Looking then upon the Congre&s;s as lawfully a&s;&s;embled, let us now atttend to their proper bu&s;ine&s;s. This was, as has been already ob&s;erved, to procure for the American colonies relief from parliamentary taxation. If we examine the <HI>credentials</HI> that were laid before the Congre&s;s, we &s;hall find, that the Dele|gates from <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> were &s;ent, to <Q>con&s;ult and adopt (&s;uch) mea&s;ures, as may have the mo&s;t likely tendency to ex|tricate the colonies from their pre&s;ent difficulties, to &s;ecure and perpetuate the rights, liberties and privileges, and to re&s;tore that peace, harmony and mutual confidence, which once happily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the parent country and her colonies.</Q></P>
<P>The Delegates from the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> were <HI>publicly</HI> au|thorized to proceed <HI>no farther</HI> than, in conjunction with the other members of the Congre&s;s,
<Q>to deliberate and determine upon wi&s;e and proper mea&s;ures, to be by them recommended to all the Colonies, for the recovery and e&s;tabli&s;hment of their ju&s;t rights and liberties, civil and religious <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quere, What <HI>religious</HI> rights had been invaded by the Parliament?</NOTE>, and the re&s;toration of union and harmony between Great Britain and the Colonies, mo&s;t ardently de&s;ired by all good men.</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e from <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> were authori&s;ed and empowered by the Governor,
<Q>to meet and join with the Commi&s;&s;ioners or Delegates from the other Colonies, in con&s;ulting upon pro|per mea&s;ures to obtain a repeal of the &s;everal acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament, &amp;c. and upon proper mea&s;ures to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the rights and liberties of the Colonies upon a ju&s;t and &s;olid foundation.</Q></P>
<P>The Delegates from <HI>Connecticut</HI> were authori&s;ed and empow|ered to attend the Congre&s;s,
<Q>to con&s;ult and advi&s;e with the Commi&s;&s;ioners or Committees of the &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in America, on proper mea&s;ures for advancing the be&s;t good of the Colonies.</Q></P>
<P>If we come home to <HI>New-York,</HI> our confidence in the wi&s;|dom and prudence of the Gentlemen appointed to go as Dele|gates from hence, was &s;o great, that we gave them no particular in&s;tructions, but only a general commi&s;&s;ion "<HI>to attend the Con|gre&s;s</HI> at Philadelphia."</P>
<P>The Delegates from <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> had the like general com|mi&s;&s;ion, being only nominated and appointed,
<Q>to <HI>repre&s;ent</HI> the colony of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> in the &s;aid general congre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013866_0008_0F925D5B8F8FA868">In <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly appointed a commit|tee from them&s;elves to attend the Congre&s;s, in behalf of that province,
<Q>to con&s;ult upon the pre&s;ent unhappy &s;tate of the Colonies, and to form and adopt a plan for the purpo&s;es of obtaining redre&s;s of American grievances, a&s;certaining Ame|rican rights upon the mo&s;t &s;olid and con&s;titutional principles, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing that union and harmony between Great Britain and the Colonies, which is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare and happine&s;s of both.</Q></P>
<P>The Deputies from the <HI>Three Lower Counties,</HI> were &s;ent to the Congre&s;s,
<Q>to con&s;ult and advi&s;e with the Deputies from the other Colonies, and to determine upon all &s;uch prudent and lawful mea&s;ures, as may be judged mo&s;t expedient for the Colonies immediately and unitedly to adopt, in order to ob|tain relief for an oppre&s;&s;ed people, and the redre&s;s of our general grievances.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far all &s;eems to be fair and pacific. The Delegates from the&s;e eight colonies are &s;ent to the Congre&s;s, for the mo&s;t laud|able purpo&s;es, of obtaining the repeal of certain obnoxious acts, and of promoting the re&s;toration of peace and harmony between Great Britain and her Colonies. And in the pro&s;ecution of this great and good work, they are generally confined by their in&s;tructions, to the u&s;e of &s;uch means as are <HI>prudent</HI> and <HI>lawful.</HI></P>
<P>But if we go on to <HI>Maryland,</HI> matters there will appear doubt|ful, and &s;u&s;picious. The Delegates from thence are appointed to do all in their power, in the Congre&s;s,
<Q>to effect one gene|ral plan of conduct, <HI>operating on the commercial connexion</HI> of the Colonies with the Mother Country.</Q>
This expre&s;&s;ion is ambiguous. To operate on this <HI>commercial connexion</HI> may &s;ig|nify either to &s;trengthen or weaken it, with equal propriety. If the <HI>former</HI> was intended, then their Delegates were employed to con&s;ult the Congre&s;s in forming a plan, for increa&s;ing the inter|cour&s;e between Great Britain and her Colonies, in the way of <HI>commerce.</HI> And why they &s;hould have meant the latter, I cannot conceive. For I &s;hould think the people of Maryland would have no objections again&s;t a <HI>commercial connexion</HI> with Great Britain, however adver&s;e they may be to a connexion of another kind.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;tep from Maryland into <HI>Virginia,</HI> and we &s;hall hear more of this operation upon <HI>commercial connexions.</HI> For there the Delegates are in&s;tructed, nay the whole Congre&s;s is in&s;tructed,
<Q>to con&s;ider of the mo&s;t proper and <HI>effectual</HI> man|ner of &s;o operating on the <HI>commercial connexion</HI> of the colonies with the mother-country; as to procure redre&s;s for the much
<PB N="10" REF="013866_0009_0F925D5C3A778B68">
injured province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, to &s;ecure <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> America <HI>from</HI> (not <HI>again&s;t</HI>) the <HI>ravage</HI> and <HI>ruin</HI> of arbitrary taxes, and &s;peedily to procure the return of that harmony and union &s;o beneficial to the whole nation, and &s;o ardently de&s;ired by all Briti&s;h America.</Q>
From the language that is here u&s;ed, a &s;tranger would imagine, that all <HI>Briti&s;h America</HI> was reduced to the utmo&s;t extremity of di&s;tre&s;s by the <HI>arbitrary</HI> and oppre&s;&s;ive tyranny of Great Britain. But God be thanked! whatever the <HI>poor</HI> Virginians may have &s;uffered, we &s;ee no marks yet of the <HI>ravage</HI> and <HI>ruin</HI> abovementioned in the province of New-York, or in the adjacent colonies. The Virginians have a right to &s;eek relief from their di&s;tre&s;s, and with that view they may, at any time, re&s;olve for them&s;elves to operate on their own commercial connexion with Great Britain, if they think proper to try the experiment. But if this operation is to put an end to, or to &s;u&s;pend, all commerce with Great Britain, how it can be productive of the harmony, and union propo&s;ed, is more than I can gue&s;s. The breaking of a connexion between two di&s;tant bodies can have no tendency to produce an union between them; and the &s;etting up a fixed oppo&s;ition on either &s;ide, is not the mo&s;t likely way to obtain harmony.</P>
<P>In <HI>South Carolina,</HI> while <HI>rice</HI> is their &s;taple commodity, they know better than to think of <HI>operating</HI> in &s;uch a way, upon the <HI>commercial connexion</HI> afore&s;aid. Therefore they only gave it in charge to their Delegates,
<Q>to concert, agree to, and effectu|ally pro&s;ecute &s;uch <HI>legal</HI> mea&s;ures, as in the opinion of the &s;aid deputies, and of the deputies &s;o to be a&s;&s;embled, &s;hall be mo&s;t likely to obtain a repeal of the &s;aid acts, and a redre&s;s of tho&s;e grievances.</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t commi&s;&s;ion produced in the Congre&s;s was from <HI>North-Carolina</HI>; by which the deputies from that colony were authori&s;ed
<Q>to deliberate upon the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Briti&s;h Ame|rica, and to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as they may deem prudent to effect the purpo&s;e of de&s;cribing with certainty the rights of Americans, repairing the breach made in tho&s;e rights, and for guarding them for the future from any &s;uch violations done under the &s;anction of public authority.</Q></P>
<P>We &s;ee now the powers that were committed to tho&s;e, who were to con&s;titute the congre&s;s. If we compare their commi&s;|&s;ions together, it will appear that the general and grand de&s;ign was, as was a&s;&s;erted before, to obtain for the colonies an exemp|tion from taxation by the Briti&s;h Parliament. In the pur&s;uit of this great object, many of the Delegates are expre&s;sly directed by their re&s;pective con&s;tituents, to confine them&s;elves to the

u&s;e of &s;uch means and mea&s;ures as are proper and lawful; &s;ome of them are particularly cautioned to ob&s;erve the rules of <HI>pru|dence</HI> in the cour&s;e of their proceedings; and &s;ome of them are very &s;ea&s;onably reminded, that they were to negociate, not for an <HI>independent</HI> community, but for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> America; that is, if I under&s;tand the expre&s;&s;ion, for North America, con&s;idered as a part of the <HI>Briti&s;h dominions.</HI></P>
<P>If the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions are thought by any to require a more particular explanation, they may have recour&s;e to the <HI>re&s;olves</HI> of the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies and Committees, which they pub|li&s;hed previou&s;ly to their nominating and appointing Delegates to repre&s;ent them in Congre&s;s, and in which their principles and their views are particularly explained&punc; Of the&s;e <HI>re&s;olves</HI> more will be &s;aid pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s being met together, and having in&s;pected and compared their various commi&s;&s;ions, were next to proceed upon bu&s;ine&s;s. With a view of facilitating the proceedings, a very worthy and re&s;pectable member, eminent both for his know|ledge of the law, and his love of con&s;titutional liberty, pre|&s;ented a plan, which he carefully drew up in the cool hours of lei&s;ure and retirement, and in which he endeavoured to point out &s;uch claims of the colonies as might be prudently a&s;&s;erted, and the particular modes of addre&s;s that would be mo&s;t likely to &s;ecure them. This paper of propo&s;als, at fir&s;t, met with all the re&s;pect that was due to the author's abilities; and nothing appeared that was incon&s;i&s;tent with the genuine &s;pirit of can|dour and moderation on one &s;ide, and a due regard to the dig|nity and honour of Great-Britain on the other.</P>
<P>During this &s;tate of flattering tranquillity, the artful leaders of the Congre&s;s found no great difficulty in per&s;uading tho&s;e members who were patriots in reality, moderate and pacific, hone&s;t and un&s;u&s;picious, to bind them&s;elves in an agreement, that their names &s;hould be &s;ub&s;cribed to whatever &s;hould be carried by a majority of votes, and that no <HI>prote&s;t</HI> or <HI>di&s;&s;ent</HI> &s;hould appear in the <HI>minutes.</HI></P>
<P>After this great point was &s;ecured, it was not long before tho&s;e &s;ame leaders took occa&s;ion to throw off their ma&s;k, and to di&s;cover their own natural features. This new appearance was no more expected by &s;ome that were pre&s;ent, than the &s;pringing of a mine, or the bur&s;ting of a bomb, in Carpen|ter's-Hall; nor was it le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing to them, than &s;uch an explo&s;ion would have been. The moderate party &s;oon found, that they had been circumvented and en&s;nared; that they were allowed to have no influence in the debates; that their remon|&s;trances
<PB N="12" REF="013866_0011_0F925D5DC1085BC8">
were &s;lighted; and that every thing was borne down by the impetuo&s;ity of their managers. Then it was, that duty and honour required them, as I conceive, to leave the Hall. This account of the unpubli&s;hed tran&s;actions within doors, is not a fiction of the writer's imagination, but what he has col|lected from credible report.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to form a judgment from more indi&s;put|able evidence, and &s;ee how matters &s;tand in the <HI>publications</HI> of the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>There are but four po&s;&s;ible ways of &s;ecuring to the colonies an exemption from the authority in que&s;tion; namely, by force of arms, by force of threatenings, by force of evidence that we are ju&s;tly entitled to our claims, and by the efficacy of re&s;pectful repre&s;entations and petitions.</P>
<P>As to the two fir&s;t of the&s;e ways the congre&s;s had no authority or directions from their con&s;tituents to pur&s;ue them; but, on the contrary, mo&s;t of them were forbid to pur&s;ue them, by being charged to keep within the bounds of what was <HI>prudent</HI> and <HI>lawful.</HI> Whatever therefore was done by them, in either of the&s;e ways, was <HI>without</HI> orders, in &s;ome in&s;tances contrary to orders, and can lay no obligation even upon their <HI>con&s;tituents.</HI></P>
<P>If pa&s;&s;ing by the words of their <HI>in&s;tructions,</HI> we have recour&s;e to the general &s;entiments of the Colonies, when the Congre&s;s was appointed, it will not help the matter. At that time it was the opinion of the Colonies, that &s;ubjection and obedience were due from us to Great-Britain, in mo&s;t ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Her general &s;upremacy over the Colonies was then acknow|ledged; and it was the opinion that the time was not come, in which it was proper to claim an independency, or in which they were able to &s;upport it. On the&s;e principles, the u&s;e of force or compul&s;ion again&s;t Great-Britain is both imprudent and un|lawful, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with that &s;ubjection which is al|lowed to be due. Con&s;equently we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that the Colonies, at that time, intended to make the Congre&s;s a meer <HI>Council of War,</HI> to concert plans of ho&s;tility again&s;t Great-Bri|tain, in order to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s her of her American juri&s;diction; and if the Congre&s;s was not erected into a council of war by their con&s;tituents, they had no right to act in that capacity, and every ho&s;tile effort that they made, was in virtue of an u&s;urped or &s;elf-delegated authority.</P>
<P>What the general opinion, even of the mo&s;t di&s;&s;atisfied part of the Colonies, then was, relating to the&s;e points, may be &s;een in the <HI>printed re&s;olves</HI> from all parts of the country; and it is not to be gathered from the pa&s;&s;ionate <HI>verbal</HI> declarations of
<PB N="13" REF="013866_0012_0F925D5E83250208">
fellows, who&s;e greate&s;t merit con&s;i&s;ts in blu&s;tering and bellow|ing at town meetings, or in a&s;&s;emblies of the <HI>mobility.</HI> In mo&s;t of tho&s;e re&s;olves, the <HI>loyalty</HI> of the people is warmly a&s;&s;erted, and their abhorrence of an ab&s;olute independency, as de&s;tructive to the Colonies, is as warmly avowed. And therefore, if any weight was to be allowed to the many public and &s;olemn de|clarations of tho&s;e <HI>re&s;olves,</HI> the Congre&s;s mu&s;t have known, that it was no part of their bu&s;ine&s;s to concert mea&s;ures that were incon&s;i&s;tent with the loyalty profe&s;&s;ed, or with the &s;ubordination acknowledged to be due to the mother country,&mdash;at lea&s;t, till all other methods &s;hould be tried, and found to be ineffectual, and till they &s;hould receive new in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>It follows from this view of the ca&s;e, by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence, that all that was done or projected by the congre&s;s, in the way of ho&s;tility again&s;t Great-Britain (and little was done or projected by them in any other way) was uncommi&s;&s;ioned and unauthori&s;ed, and cannot be binding even upon their con|&s;tituents.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> way abovementioned, I will, at pre&s;ent, only ob&s;erve, that what they had no right nor power to do, they had no right to <HI>threaten</HI> that they would do; and that we are no more obliged to adopt the language of their threatenings, than to execute their projects of ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> way of &s;ecuring to the Colonies an exemption from the authority of parliament, with regard to taxation, would have been to prove, that this privilege had been properly grant|ed to them, either in the original e&s;tabli&s;hment of the colonies, or by &s;ome legal &s;ub&s;equent act. A point of this nature mu&s;t be proved by clear <HI>facts,</HI> and not by metaphy&s;ical arguments, taken from the ab&s;tract nature of Engli&s;hmen, and of &s;uch Engli&s;hmen too as refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Engli&s;h laws. For though the parliament has always exerci&s;ed the authority which is now conte&s;ted, and has in a late act declared,
<Q>that the &s;aid Co|lonies have been, are, and of right ought to be &s;ubordinate unto, and dependent on the imperial crown and parliament of Great-Britain; and that the King and Parliament of Great Britain had, have, and of right ought to have full power and authority to make laws and &s;tatutes of &s;ufficient force to bind the Colonies, and his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in them, <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever</HI>;</Q>
which doctrine is as firmly believed by the in|habitants of Great-Britain in general, as the contrary is by perhaps one half of the Americans: yet, if the congre&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="013866_0013_0F925D5F40290FB8">
could have made it appear, either by authentic facts, or con|clu&s;ive arguments, that the parliament was mi&s;taken, it would have gone far towards &s;ecuring the great object in view. If after that the parliament would have &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in its claim, we might have appealed to the world for its invali|dity; and none of us would have had <HI>&s;cruples of con&s;cience,</HI> to prevent our joining in a general a&s;&s;ociation to recover by a vigorous effort, a right that was rendered unque&s;tionable. But the Congre&s;s has neither proved the right, nor attempted to prove it. <HI>Non ad di&s;putandum, &s;ed ad judicandum, &s;e conveni&s;&s;e aiebat &s;ynodus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> way for obtaining the relief propo&s;ed, is that of re&s;pectful repre&s;entation, or remon&s;trance, and petition. The Congre&s;s indeed, has remon&s;trated and petitioned; but to whom? Why, not to the King <HI>and</HI> parliament, as they ought to have done; but, as they by no means ought to have done, to the inhabitants of the Colonies, with a particular view to the di&s;affected part of them,&mdash;to the <HI>people</HI> of Great-Britain,&mdash;and, as very "&s;incere and affectionate friends," to the Papi&s;ts in Canada.</P>
<Q>"Flectere &s;i nequeo <HI>Superos, Acheronta</HI> movebo."</Q>
<P>And what is the purport of the&s;e &s;everal addre&s;&s;es? In&s;tead of exhorting the inhabitants of the Colonies, as the ca&s;e re|quired, to return immediately to their duty, to behave them|&s;elves peaceably, to pur&s;ue the bu&s;ine&s;s of their re&s;pective &s;tations and occupations, not pragmatically to meddle with matters out of their line, and above their capacities, and to leave the di|rection of political affairs to the con&s;titutional guardians of their liberties; I &s;ay, in&s;tead of doing this, they &s;et them all up for politicians and patriots, inflame their minds with re&s;entment again&s;t their lawful &s;uperiors, and animate them to rebellion.</P>
<P>The tendency of their addre&s;s to the people of Great-Britain, is &s;imilar, it being artfully adapted to the purpo&s;e; which is to per&s;uade them to take part with the malecontents of America, in oppo&s;ition to their own Sovereign, and the whole legi&s;lative body, and in defiance of all laws human and divine. Through|out this addre&s;s, there &s;eems to be no &s;mall diffidence of its &s;uc|ceeding; and therefore under the alternate operation of hope, and fear, and contempt, the blind and &s;tupid Engli&s;hmen are occa&s;ionally either coaxed, or threatened, or given to under|&s;tand, that we look upon them as a parcel of fools and puppies.</P>
<P>After all, the addre&s;s to the Canadians is undoubtedly the mo&s;t unpardonable of the three, as it di&s;covers the deepe&s;t and
<PB N="15" REF="013866_0014_0F925D6001CDDE48">
mo&s;t inveterate malignity again&s;t the mother country. In that we &s;ee every mean, cajoling art practiced, that was thought likely to di&s;affect the Canadians to the government they are un|der, and to corrupt their fidelity.</P>
<P>This is what the Congre&s;s has done in the way of petition and remon&s;trance; excepting the petition to the King, which they tell us they have &s;ent. But if the petition be of a piece with the addre&s;&s;es, and dictated by the &s;ame evil &s;pirit; it would have &s;hewn more wi&s;dom, and mode&s;ty, and as much loyalty, to have preferred a petition, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, to the King of France, or the Emperor of Morocco.</P>
<P>The only way that had &s;o much as a chance for &s;ucceed|ing, and which all rea&s;onable men, &s;o far as I can learn, ex|pected the Congre&s;s would pur&s;ue, was that of dutiful and re&s;|pectful application to the <HI>King, Lords and Commons</HI> of Great-Britain, upon who&s;e united con&s;ent and concurrence the important conce&s;&s;ion depended, and if the Congre&s;s had ad|dre&s;&s;ed <HI>only</HI> the three branches of the legi&s;lature of Great Britain, in behalf of the colonies; and if the addre&s;&s;es to them had been duly expre&s;&s;ive, of loyalty to the King&mdash; of a de|&s;ire to continue members of the great Briti&s;h empire,&mdash;of a willing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;uperintending authority of Great-Britain&mdash;of an aver&s;ion to a &s;tate of independency, except in matters of taxation only&mdash;of a readine&s;s to com|ply with the King's requi&s;itions in all ca&s;es of exigency, and al&s;o to contribute &s;ome equitable annual &s;um, towards defraying the annual charges of government, in con&s;ideration of being relea&s;ed from parliamentary taxation; and if, at the &s;ame time, they had endeavoured to excu&s;e, as well as they could, the late unwarrantable proceedings in mo&s;t of the Colonies, begging they might &s;ink in eternal oblivion: I doubt not but petitions, formed on &s;ome &s;uch plan, and attended with no cir|cum&s;tances that were offen&s;ive or exceptionable; would have had much weight with the King and Parliament; and it is not improbable that the prayer of them would have been granted.</P>
<P>Nor let it be &s;aid, that <HI>&s;uch</HI> petitions from the Congre&s;s would not have been received. They could not have been re|ceived, as coming from a legal body; but they might have been received, as coming from a number of re&s;pectable men, and relating to matters of great importance to the public. In January, 1769, a petition on this very &s;ubject of parliamentary taxation, was pre&s;ented to Parliament, from a number of Gen|tlemen of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, which included a majority of the members of the Council, and was &s;igned by Mr. <HI>Dan|forth,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="013866_0015_0F925D60B5267200">
as Pre&s;ident.
<Q>It however appearing that this petition had not pa&s;&s;ed in a <HI>legal a&s;&s;embly</HI> of the Council, and that con&s;equently no per&s;on could be authori&s;ed to &s;ign it <HI>as Pre|&s;ident,</HI> it was refu&s;ed under <HI>that title,</HI> and was ordered to be brought up, only as a petition from <HI>Samuel Danforth,</HI> in behalf of the &s;everal individual members of the Council, at who&s;e reque&s;t it had been &s;igned.</Q>
This is a ca&s;e directly in point; and we may infer from it, that although the Parlia|ment would not have received an addre&s;s, &s;igned by Mr. <HI>Ran|dolph,</HI> as <HI>Pre&s;ident of the Congre&s;s,</HI> yet that they <HI>might</HI> have received one as coming from <HI>Peyton Randolph,</HI> in behalf of all tho&s;e individuals who were members of the Congre&s;s. This way of <HI>addre&s;&s;ing</HI> the Parliament would therefore have been prudent and rational, and far more likely to &s;ucceed than any other which the Congre&s;s could have taken. And after &s;uch a trial, if it failed of &s;ucce&s;s, the colonies would have been le&s;s inexcu&s;able in proceeding to violent mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The reader will be better able to form a proper judgment of this matter, if he attends to the following excellent letter, written to the Governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay in 1765, by <HI>General</HI> CONWAY, then one of his Maje&s;ty's Principal Secre|taries of State, and as true a friend to the rights and liberties of America, as England has ever bred. Though he wrote <HI>officially,</HI> yet the letter is known to expre&s;s his own particular &s;entiments, as well as tho&s;e of the admini&s;tration. It is in the following words:</P>
<P>"It is with the greate&s;t concern his Maje&s;ty learns the di|&s;turbances which have lately ari&s;en in your province, the gene|ral confu&s;ion that &s;eems to reign there, and the total langour and want of energy in your government to exert it&s;elf with any dignity or efficacy, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of tumults, which &s;eem to &s;trike at the very being of all authority and &s;ubordination among&s;t you.</P>
<P>"Nothing can certainly exceed the <HI>ill-advi&s;ed</HI> and intempe|rate conduct held by a party in your province, <HI>which can in no way contribute to the removal of any real grievance</HI> they might labour under, but may <HI>tend to impede and ob&s;truct</HI> the exertion of his Maje&s;ty's <HI>benevolent attention to the ea&s;e and comfort, as well as to the welfare</HI> of all his people.</P>
<P>"It is hoped and expected, that this want of confidence in the ju&s;tice and tenderne&s;s of the mother country, and this open re&s;i&s;tance to its authority, can only have found place among the <HI>lower and more ignorant</HI> of the people: The <HI>better and wi&s;er</HI> part of the Colonies will <HI>know,</HI> that <HI>decency and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion may
<PB N="17" REF="013866_0016_0F925D6182E8A100">
prevail,</HI> not only to <HI>redre&s;s Grievances,</HI> but to <HI>obtain Grace and Favour, while the outrage of a public violence can expect nothing but &s;everity and cha&s;ti&s;ement.</HI></P>
<P>"The&s;e &s;entiments you and all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants, from a &s;en&s;e of your duty to, and love of your country, will endeavor to excite and encourage; you will all in a particular manner, call upon them, <HI>not to render their ca&s;e de&s;perate.</HI> You will in the &s;tronge&s;t colours repre&s;ent to them the <HI>dreadful con&s;equences</HI> that mu&s;t inevitably attend the <HI>forcible and violent re&s;i&s;tance to acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament,</HI> and the &s;cene of mi&s;ery and de&s;truction to both countries, in&s;eparable from &s;uch a conduct.</P>
<P>For however unwillingly his Maje&s;ty may con&s;ent to the ex|ertion of &s;uch powers as may endanger the &s;afety of a &s;ingle &s;ubject; <HI>yet can he not permit his own dignity and the authority of the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature to be trampled on by force and violence, and in avowed contempt of all order, duty, and decorum.</HI></P>
<P>"If the &s;ubject is aggrieved, he knows in what manner <HI>legally and con&s;titutionally to apply for relief</HI>; but <HI>it is not &s;uitable either to the &s;afety or dignity</HI> of the Briti&s;h Empire, that any indi|viduals, under the <HI>pretence of redre&s;&s;ing grievances,</HI> &s;hould pre|&s;ume to <HI>violate the public peace.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">All the Printers of NEWS-PAPERS on this Continent, who have a Regard for the true Intere&s;ts of their Country, are reque&s;ted to publi&s;h the above Let|ter, in order to give &s;ome check to the Operation of that &s;editious Poi&s;on which &s;o many of the Americans have been per&s;uaded inadvertently <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;wallow.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this Letter, with which the Congre&s;s mu&s;t have been ac|quainted, the only way of procuring the redre&s;s of American Grievances, and of obtaining favour from Great-Britain, is pointed out <HI>by authority</HI>; and a friendly caution is given again&s;t a contrary way of proceeding, as it can expect <HI>nothing but &s;eve|rity and cha&s;ti&s;ement.</HI> The Congre&s;s <HI>therefore,</HI> in order to pro|cure a redre&s;s of American grievances, and to obtain the favor of a free American con&s;titution (which was the purport of their commi&s;&s;ion) in their profound Wi&s;dom and Sagacity, have re|jected the only way, which they had been told would be likely to &s;ucceed, and have adopted that &s;pecific mode of conduct which they had been told would not &s;ucceed, but would bring down upon them and their adherents <HI>&s;everity</HI> and <HI>cha&s;ti&s;ement,</HI> and <HI>render their ca&s;e de&s;perate.</HI></P>
<P>But this was &s;uch a breach of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and &s;o contrary to the very end and de&s;ign of their ap|pointment, that even tho&s;e whom they call their con&s;titu|ents cannot po&s;&s;ibly be bound, either in honour or con&s;cience
<PB N="18" REF="013866_0017_0F925D6236C26AD8">
to abide by it. Some that were forward in voting for de|legates to repre&s;ent them in the congre&s;s, are highly cha|grined and di&s;gu&s;ted at their proceedings, and &s;cruple not to declare, that, for their parts, they gave them no power to &s;hut up the ports, and &s;top their nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of the country, upon which the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the people ab&s;olutely depended; much le&s;s to provoke and in&s;ult a power, which never yet has been provoked and in&s;ulted with impunity. And as to others, who &s;till appear to approve of the proceedings of the Congre&s;s; they did not, becau&s;e they <HI>could</HI> not, give their Delegates a power to act in oppo&s;ition to the laws of their country and that the general cour&s;e of their acti|ons was, in almo&s;t every point contrary to law, will &s;hortly be proved.</P>
<P>If then their <HI>con&s;tituents</HI> are not bound by their proceedings, there can be no di&s;pute with regard to others, who amount to a large majority of the inhabitants, e&s;pecially in the province of New-York. In &s;ome Parts of this province, the people had no meetings at all, as they would have no hand in the manu|facturing of committees. In other parts, the meetings did not con&s;i&s;t of a hundredth part of the inhabitants; and there is nei|there county, town nor precinct in the province, excepting the county and city of New-York, in which the number of voters for Committee-men, was comparable with the number of tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to be concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s, if I have been rightly informed. The greate&s;t part of this province therefore are under no ties, either real or imaginary, to &s;ubmit to the de|ci&s;ions of the Congre&s;s; but, on the contrary, they are under the &s;tronge&s;t ties, both of duty and intere&s;t, to give them no countenance. We are not to judge of the province in general, from appearances in the city; nor ought we to imagine, that our &s;ub&s;tantial Farmers, or the Store-keepers and Trade&s;men in the country, becau&s;e they have tamely &s;ubmitted, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, to be <HI>governed</HI> by the city, will con&s;ent to be <HI>ruined</HI> by it.</P>
<P>As matters have turned out, it is much to the credit of this province, that &s;o very &s;mall a part of it was repre&s;ented in the Congre&s;s. It is a farther credit to us, that, as <HI>we have rea&s;on to believe,</HI> the Delegates from hence oppo&s;ed, with all their influence, the headlong and de&s;tructive mea&s;ures taken by the Congre&s;s, that they &s;till di&s;approve of them, and that they do not really wi&s;h that we would pur&s;ue them. This is naturally inferred from their known di&s;po&s;ition and &s;entiments; and our opinion is confirmed by certain <HI>anecdotes</HI> from Philadelphia, that have reached us. If this was actually the ca&s;e, our oppo|&s;ition
<PB N="19" REF="013866_0018_0F925D6305108DF8">
to the proceedings of the Congre&s;s, or rather our total di&s;regard of them otherwi&s;e than to &s;hew our contempt and ab|horrence of them, is al&s;o ju&s;tified by the oppo&s;ition that was made to them on the &s;pot, by the New-York Delegates, on their fir&s;t propo&s;al. None of us had any thing to do with the Congre&s;s but by repre&s;entation; all that we did by repre&s;enta|tion, was to oppo&s;e and prote&s;t again&s;t what was tran&s;acted; and after having oppo&s;ed the proceedings of the Congre&s;s by our particular <HI>repre&s;entatives,</HI> tho&s;e of us who were then repre|&s;ented, are bound in honour <HI>per&s;onally</HI> to oppo&s;e them too.</P>
<P>That &s;uch was the conduct of the Delegates from New-York, is the general opinion. We think however, that we are ju&s;tly entitled to more direct and authentic information; and there|fore tho&s;e Gentlemen are now called upon explicitly to declare, how far they con&s;ented to, or oppo&s;ed, the re&s;olutions of the Congre&s;s. When <HI>the people,</HI> under no directions of the law, but prompted by their own alacrity, choo&s;e agents to appear for them, and negociate their concerns at a general meeting of <HI>popular</HI> committees from different parts of the country; they have always a right to be informed, in what particular manner the tru&s;t has been executed. No re&s;olves of perpetual &s;ecrecy, no combinations to keep their employers always in the dark, <HI>could</HI> di&s;&s;olve the prior obligations our Delegates were under, to make report, on their return, in what manner they di&s;charged their commi&s;&s;ion, and how far they exerted them&s;elves to fulfil the de&s;ign of their appointment.</P>
<P>Accordingly it is hoped, that the worthy and candid Gen|tlemen, who appeared at the Congre&s;s in behalf of this pro|vince, will take the hint, and not wait to be called upon again, as they certainly will be if they refu&s;e to comply; and make a full and clear report of their own particular tran&s;actions, during the debates and proceedings of the Congre&s;s. Till we certain|ly know <HI>how</HI> they acted to <HI>thank</HI> them for their actions, will be premature, ab&s;urd and prepo&s;terous,&mdash;a&s;king the pardon of our city <HI>Mechanics.</HI></P>
<P>What is called a <HI>Journal</HI> of the tran&s;actions of the Congre&s;s, after a long while made its appearance. Why this was kept back near a month, unle&s;s to &s;ee in what manner the <HI>Extracts</HI> that had been publi&s;hed would be received by the public, I am unable to explain. I pretend not to fathom the depth of <HI>congre&s;&s;ional</HI> politics. I can only &s;ay, that on peru&s;ing the <HI>Jour|nal,</HI> I was not a little di&s;appointed. I imagined that after a month's labour of the pre&s;s, the production would have been a huge volume of <HI>the Proceedings,</HI> which would have clearly and
<PB N="20" REF="013866_0019_0F925D63B9C4C5C8" MS="y">
faithfully &s;hewn, what part each member contributed to the mighty work that was formed. But&mdash;<HI>parturiunt montes.</HI> We are &s;till in the dark, nearly as much as ever. We are told in|deed what Committees were appointed to frame the &s;everal addre&s;&s;es; but we are not told what particular members of tho&s;e Committees di&s;&s;ented from the re&s;t, and were over-ruled by the majority. In &s;hort we know not from the <HI>Journal,</HI> what part any one gentleman acted, who was honoured with our confidence, and entru&s;ted in &s;ome degree with our intere&s;ts and &s;afety. Till this matter is explained, or, at lea&s;t, till &s;ome a&s;&s;urances are given, that it &s;hall be explained, every member of the Congre&s;s mu&s;t bear a part of the odium of hav|ing jointly contributed to the formation of a plan, which is, like what they are plea&s;ed to call the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> religion of Ca|nada "fraught with &s;anguinary and impious tenets," and which will go near to prove fatal to the Colonies.</P>
<P>If the greate&s;t Enemies of Briti&s;h-America had been em|ployed to contrive the ruin of the colonies, they could not have propo&s;ed a more effectual &s;cheme for the purpo&s;e, than that we &s;hould be led on to provoke the re&s;entment, and enrage the power, of Great-Britain, by acts of ho&s;tility and rebellion. Now the Congre&s;s appears to me, and ap|pears to thou&s;ands of others in this country, not indeed to have contrived, but to have adopted from New-England, this very &s;cheme; and then to have recommended it to the Americans with all their influence.</P>
<P>That a forcible oppo&s;ition to the King's troops, when im|ployed to protect the Kings civil officers in the execution of the Briti&s;h laws within the Briti&s;h dominions, is an act of ho&s;tility again&s;t Great-Britain, is &s;urely too plain to require proof. The laws of England have made it <HI>trea&s;on,</HI> which is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t unpardonable of all crimes relating to the &s;tate. For when crimes of this nature are properly cla&s;|ed,
<Q>The third &s;pecies of trea&s;on is, if a man do <HI>levy war again&s;t our Lord the King in his realm.</HI> And this may be done by taking arms, not only to dethrone the King, but under pretence to reform religion, or the <HI>laws,</HI> or <HI>to remove evil councellors,</HI> or <HI>other grievances,</HI> whether real or pretended</Q>

<P>If this &s;cheme be analyzed, it will be found evidently to contain in it the following ingredients. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> a DECLARA|TION of INDEPENDENCY, made by the <HI>Suffolk</HI> Committees, a&s;&s;erting that <HI>no obedience is due</HI> from them to any <HI>acts of Par|liaments,</HI> which they di&s;approve of. <HI>Secondly,</HI> an EDICT, to &s;hut up the courts of ju&s;tice, which &s;hall pre&s;ume to act by authority derived from the King and Parliament. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> a PROSCRIPTION, of all that do not re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions held under the authority afore&s;aid, as <HI>ob&s;tinate and incorrigible enemies,</HI> who are to be treated accordingly. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> a PRO|CLAMATION, that officers be forthwith appointed by the peo|ple, to &s;uper&s;ede tho&s;e that are appointed by the Crown. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> an ORDER, i&s;&s;ued to their own officers and people to <HI>arm</HI> them&s;elves, and <HI>learn the art of war,</HI> to qualify them to fight again&s;t their LAWFUL SOVEREIGN. And, <HI>Sixthly,</HI> a DECREE, for &s;eizing and throwing under confinement, (per|haps in dungeons, with a &s;canty allowance of bread and water only) every per&s;on in the province who is thought worthy of confidence by the crown; in ca&s;e the King's officers of ju&s;|tice &s;hould be &s;o <HI>audacious,</HI> as to apprehend any of tho&s;e de|linquents who have <HI>rendered them&s;elves con&s;picuous</HI> in the late riotous, tumultuous and &s;editious proceedings of that province.</P>
<P>Now if all this does not amount to an open revolt and rebellion, I have always mi&s;taken the meaning of the word; and I &s;hall be obliged to any gentleman, learned in the law or acquainted with hi&s;tory, if he will inform me, or the public, what rebellion is.</P>
<P>Indeed what rebellion is not, we have been lately told, with much confidence, in the STRICTURES of a certain <HI>wandering &s;pirit</HI>; who has thought fit to interpo&s;e in the <HI>literary</HI> way for the honour of New-England. This writer contends, that
<Q>no man who is not blinded by the Daemon of <HI>Jacobiti&s;m,</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly be guilty of the weakne&s;s,</Q>
of calling <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s re&s;i&s;tance a <HI>rebellion.</HI> It will be allowed on all &s;ides, that if <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s dethroning and murdering his Sovereign, who&s;e right to the throne was unque&s;tionable&mdash;his ravaging and laying
<PB N="24" REF="013866_0023_0F925D6FAE97E6F8">
wa&s;te his kingdoms&mdash;his di&s;&s;olving the authority of the Lords and Commons,&mdash;and his total &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution,&mdash; did not amount to a rebellion; then the people of <HI>Suffolk</HI> are not guilty of rebellion. But whatever this political <HI>partizan</HI> may think of the matter, all reputable writers, whether of our own or of foreign nations, and all our acts of Parliament, that mention it, call <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s outrageous oppo&s;ition to legal au|thority, a <HI>rebellion</HI>; and one act in particular calls it,
<Q>the unnatural rebellion, u&s;urpation and tyranny of ungodly and cruel men.</Q>
In the &s;en&s;e therefore of all tho&s;e writers, and of all tho&s;e acts of Parliament, the people of <HI>Suffolk</HI> mu&s;t appear, in no &s;mall degree, to be guilty of <HI>rebellion.</HI> The writer here referred to, intimates, that he him&s;elf is no <HI>Ja|cobite.</HI> So far may be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> enough. But if, at the &s;ame time, he had &s;hewn him&s;elf to be more of a <HI>Georgeite,</HI> and le&s;s of a <HI>Cromwellite,</HI> it would have been more becoming, in a per&s;on of his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tation.</P>
<P>Let us now lift up our eyes, and turn them to the Con|gre&s;s. As &s;oon as thy received, by expre&s;s, an authentic copy of the above-mentioned <HI>Suffolk Re&s;olves,</HI> they broke through all their rules of &s;ecrecy, and, at once, gave &s;uch a bla&s;t from the trumpet of &s;edition, as made one half of America &s;hudder. If this language be too figurative, I will endea|vour to expre&s;s my&s;elf in plainer terms. Know then, courte|ous reader, that the Congre&s;s, on receiving tho&s;e <HI>Suffolk re|&s;olves,</HI> which they ought to have &s;ent back with indignation and abhorence; on that very day, &s;ome &s;ay in the &s;ame hour, but however, without any he&s;itation, or taking time to debate, re&s;olved to proclaim from the pre&s;s, their approbation of them,&mdash;and, which is more, their <HI>thorough approbation</HI> of them,&mdash;nay, which is more &s;till, their <HI>mo&s;t thorough approba|tion</HI> of them, without any exception. This appeared from the <HI>minutes</HI> then publi&s;hed, and &s;igned, by order, CHARING THOM|SON, Secretary; in which the whole copy of tho&s;e <HI>re&s;olves</HI> is in&s;erted, and honoured with the following encomium.</P>
<Q><P>The Congre&s;s taking the <HI>foregoing</HI> into con&s;ideration,</P>

<P>That this a&s;&s;embly deeply feels the &s;uffering of their coun|trymen in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, under the operation of the late unju&s;t, cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive acts of the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment; that they <HI>mo&s;t thoroughly approve</HI> the <HI>wi&s;dom and forti|tude</HI> with which oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e wicked mini&s;terial mea|&s;ures has HITHERTO been conducted, and they <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> re|commend</HI> to their brethren a <HI>per&s;everance in the &s;ame form and
<PB N="25" REF="013866_0024_0F925D6FEE3B05A0">
temperate conduct as expre&s;&s;ed in the re&s;olutions determined upon at a meeting of the Delegates for the county of Suffolk, on Tue&s;|day the</HI> 16<HI>th in&s;tant,</HI> tru&s;ting, that the effect of the united efforts of North-America in their behalf, will carry &s;uch conviction to the Briti&s;h nation, of the unwi&s;e, unju&s;t, and ruinous policy of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration, as quickly to introduce better men and wi&s;er mea&s;ures.</P></Q>
<P>It is denied, I am told, by &s;ome of the advocates for the Congre&s;s, that they (the Congre&s;s) ever meant to &s;ignify their approbation of the <HI>whole</HI> proceedings of the county of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> But &s;uch an in&s;ult upon common &s;en&s;e is ab&s;olutely un&s;ufferable. If their meaning is to be taken from plain and unequivocal language, they certainly meant, in this <HI>re&s;olve,</HI> to expre&s;s the &s;tronge&s;t approbation of the whole, and every part, of the <HI>Suffolk</HI> proceedings.</P>
<P>That the Congre&s;s have, in reality, given their &s;anction to the rebellion that has begun in the county of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> is to me as evident as words, and corre&s;ponding facts, are able to make it. In this &s;en&s;e, the people of <HI>Suffolk</HI> them&s;elves have under|&s;tood the <HI>re&s;olve</HI>; in this &s;en&s;e, the Americans in general are known to under&s;tand it; and not a member of the Congre&s;s has &s;tood forth, to remove the mi&s;take, or to &s;often the common interpretation. Till &s;omething of the Kind is thus done, and the language of the <HI>re&s;olve</HI> is otherwi&s;e fairly accounted for; it will be impo&s;&s;ible for the Americans not to continue in the belief, that the Congre&s;s have taken the part which is here a&s;cribed to them, and have recommended a rebellious oppo&s;ition to the &s;upreme authority of the Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of a rebellious war with the Mother Country, any per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e, if he will take the liberty to exerci&s;e it, may ea&s;ily fore&s;ee. Even a final victory would effectually ruin us; as it would nece&s;&s;arily intro|duce civil wars among our&s;elves, and leave us open and expo&s;|ed to the avarice and ambition of every maritime power in Eu|rope or America. And till one part of this country &s;hall have &s;ubdued the other, and conquered a con&s;iderable part of the world be&s;ides, this peaceful region mu&s;t become, and con|tinue to be, a theatre of inconceivable mi&s;ery and horrour.</P>
<P>But that we &s;hould have any expectation or hope of being able to conquer or with &s;tand the force of Great-Britain, is to me a&s;toni&s;hing. I doubt not but the Americans are naturally as brave as any other people; and it is allowed, that they are not wanting in numbers. But they are without fortre&s;&s;es, without di&s;cipline, without military &s;tores, without money.
<PB N="26" REF="013866_0025_0F925D72E83428F8">
The&s;e are deficiencies which it mu&s;t be the work of an age to remove; and while they continue, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to keep an army in the field.</P>
<P>Some may imagine, that di&s;cipline of it&s;elf will be &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e; and that di&s;ciplined men may be ea&s;ily made in &s;uch a country as this. But it is not in the power of all the friends of the Congre&s;s, to introduce what de&s;erves the name of di&s;cipline into any of the colonies to the &s;outhward of New-England; not for want of men capable of teaching it, but for want of a fund for regular pay, and authority, to keep a proper number of &s;oldiers together. But had they men enough that were completely di&s;ciplined, they would not be able to march one regiment &s;o far as to Bo&s;ton. A regiment on actual duty, at a di&s;tance from home, mu&s;t be punctually paid, and mu&s;t be governed by an authority, the <HI>legality</HI> of which they are unable to que&s;tion; otherwi&s;e, they will &s;oon grow tired of the &s;ervice, become mutinous, learn to be jealous of their own rights and liberties, and refu&s;e to be led on, or governed by a &s;et of uncon|&s;titutional officers.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of New-England are &s;uch, that a large number of armed and half-di&s;ciplined men might be got toge|ther, in the neighbourhood of Bo&s;ton, on &s;ome great and ge|neral alarm; but they could not continue there a week, without eating up the country, and being obliged to di&s;per&s;e to avoid &s;tarving. If it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to fight the King's troops, they mu&s;t be able to bring them to a battle immediately, and at their own time; or el&s;e they will have rea&s;on to rue the attempt. Be&s;ides; &s;uppo&s;ing they had an army of 50,000 men, provided for in &s;uch a manner as to be able to form a regular encampment; if the appearance of the King's troops would not, yet a report that the <HI>&s;mall-pox</HI> was among them, in&s;tantly would put them to flight. This is not &s;aid by way of reflection on the people of New-England; for were the &s;mall-pox to get into their army, and by that means, to &s;pread through the country, it would undoubtedly &s;weep off a great part of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pur&s;ue the &s;ubject of the inability of America, to de|fend it&s;elf in a war with Great-Britain, no farther; as the reader may ea&s;ily improve upon the&s;e hints.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who are &s;o ab&s;urd as to depend upon <HI>po&s;&s;ibilities</HI> only I have but little to &s;ay. It is barely po&s;&s;ible that the &s;tars in their cour&s;es may fight in favor of the colonies, that an earth-quake may &s;wallow up the King's army in Bo&s;ton, and that every &s;hip of war and every tran&s;port ordered from England to America may be bla&s;ted with lightning, or overwhelmed

in the ocean. But if there &s;hould be no miraculous interpo&s;i|tion of heaven to defeat the natural power of the mother country, &s;hould we go on to enrage it, it mu&s;t at la&s;t fall upon us with an irri&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P>I have often thought that all our ho&s;tile declarations and ap|pearances were never intended for any thing more than threat|nings, in order to intimidate Great-Britain. If this is the ca&s;e, it appears impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. Whatever we may think of our&s;elves, it is not the opinion in England that our power at pre&s;ent is equal to theirs. Our threatnings therefore will appear to the mother country to be ridiculous and contemptible. If we have no power to execute, we have no right to threaten; and every effort in this way will expo&s;e our folly.</P>
<P>But the Congre&s;s, not relying altogether on the military &s;trength of the colonies, nor on the &s;ucce&s;s of their threatning to exert it, have proceeded al&s;o to form an <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> in which they bind them&s;elves and all whom they repre&s;ent, as far as they are able, not to import any Briti&s;h goods, after a certain limited time, and to &s;upport this re&s;olution by a non-con&s;ump|tion agreement. The non-importation is extended to Ireland, the We&s;t-Indies, the We&s;tern I&s;lands, &amp;c. After a while a non-exportation is to follow. We are then to cut our&s;elves off from all communication with tho&s;e foreign markets, which have &s;upplied and enriched the colonies; and there is not to be the lea&s;t relaxation, till twenty acts of Parliament are repeal|ed to plea&s;e us, &s;ome of which immediately affect us, and &s;ome of which do not concern us.</P>
<P>It is no &s;mall thing to obtain the repeal of one act of Par|liament, even when the regular and proper &s;teps are taken; but to demand the repeal of a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of acts, and to require that the Parliament &s;hould make the mo&s;t humiliating conce&s;&s;ions to us, is &s;uch a piece of heroi&s;m as has no parallel. And the penalty of non-compliance is &s;till more heroical than the demand it&s;elf; for it is inflicted upon our&s;elves, principally and chiefly. We engage to deprive our&s;elves of the comforts of life, to become as poor as dogs, and to live like &s;avages, if the Parliament will not con&s;ent to give up its authority. I have heard of non-importation &s;chemes before; but of none that was comparable with the pre&s;ent one.</P>
<P>In our former non-importation agreement, &s;ome regard was &s;hewn for the <HI>lives</HI> of the Americans, and therefore drugs and medicines were excepted. But now, con&s;iderations of this kind are not regarded, and we are not allowed to import anti|mony,
<PB N="28" REF="013866_0027_0F925D744935C1F0">
nor mercury, either crude or prepared, nor Je&s;uit's bark; though we know that every year thou&s;ands of lives in America are owing to a proper u&s;e of the&s;e capital medicines. We may think little of &s;uch matters, &s;o long as we or our families are in health, or before the pre&s;ent &s;tock is exhau&s;ted; but after|wards, &s;hould we, or our wives and children, come to &s;truggle with &s;ickne&s;s, and to be &s;eized with ob&s;tinate di&s;orders, which will yield to the force of no medicines, but &s;uch as we are de|prived of by our non-importation agreement, we &s;hall be apt to entertain no very high opinion of the wi&s;dom of the Congre&s;s in this particular.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to have been much pains be&s;towed upon the non-importation plan, in &s;electing and rejecting, and putting di&s;tinctions on the various articles of commerce; but after all, many parts of it appear to be whim&s;ical and partial. Thus, for in&s;tance, foreign indigo is excluded, while foreign coffee, liable to the &s;ame objections, is admitted. Foreign mola&s;&s;es is not to be imported, while it pays a duty of a penny &s;terling; but as &s;oon as the pre&s;ent act is repealed, by which it will be|come &s;ubject to a duty of &s;ix pence, the importation of it is con&s;idered as not interfering with the rights of the colonies. This, by the way, is opening a fine back-door for the &s;mugglers, with all that train of guilt which commonly attends them.</P>
<P>In the 4th article of the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> the Congre&s;s re&s;olve, after a certain period, not to
<Q><HI>export</HI> any merchandize or commodity what&s;oever to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> Ireland, or the We&s;t-Indies, <HI>except rice to Europe.</HI></Q>
This phra&s;eology is original, and hardly intelligible. In exactly the &s;ame &s;tyle the <HI>Provincial</HI> Congre&s;s of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay might re&s;olve:
<Q><HI>We will export nothing to</HI> Penn&s;ylvania, the three Lower Counties, or Long-I&s;land, except cod-fi&s;h to the North-American colonies.</Q>
But to let this pa&s;s. By the <HI>artful</HI> con&s;truction of the &s;entence, it &s;eems to have been the de&s;ign of the Con|gre&s;s to delude the Americans with an in&s;inuation, that <HI>rice</HI> might be exported from Carolina, to Europe in general, without &s;ending any part of it to Great-Britain. It may therefore be proper to explain to the reader, under what regulations the exportation of American rice has been placed by acts of Par|liament.</P>
<P>By an act, in the reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> all rice produced in the Engli&s;h plantations in America, that &s;hould be &s;ent abroad, was required to be imported into <HI>England, Wales,</HI> or <HI>Berwick upon Tweed,</HI> or to &s;ome other of the <HI>Plantations,</HI> under &s;uch &s;ecurities and penalties as certain <HI>enumerated</HI> goods and commo|dities
<PB N="29" REF="013866_0028_0F925D750DF62478">
were made &s;ubject to by an act of the 12th <HI>Charles</HI> II. But by an act of the 3d <HI>George</HI> II. it was provided, that rice may be carried from Carolina directly to any part of Europe &s;outhward of Cape <HI>Fini&s;terre,</HI> without landing it in England, as formerly required, on the following conditions:&mdash;That the ve&s;&s;els in which it is exported, be <HI>built</HI> in Great-Britain, owned by per&s;ons <HI>re&s;iding</HI> in Great-Britain, navigated chiefly by Briti&s;h &s;ailors, and cleared outwards from &s;ome port in Great-Britain, for Carolina:&mdash;That every ma&s;ter of &s;uch ve&s;&s;el, before he can be entitled to a clearance, mu&s;t obtain a <HI>licence</HI> from the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms, for loading in Caro|lina, with rice, for &s;uch parts of Europe as are &s;outhward of Cape <HI>Fini&s;terre</HI>; in order to which he mu&s;t produce a <HI>certificate</HI> from the collector and comptroller of the port where the li|cence is applied for, certifying that he has given bond, for not le&s;s than &pound;.1000 &s;terling, be his ve&s;&s;el ever &s;o &s;mall, with &s;ufficient &s;ecurity, that no tobacco, &s;ugar, &amp;c. &s;hall be taken on board, unle&s;s for the nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e of the &s;hip:&mdash;That every &s;uch ve&s;&s;el, after landing its rice in the &s;outhern European ports, &s;hall proceed to Great-Britain <HI>before</HI> it returns to America; and in ca&s;e the ma&s;ter, or others in his name, do not produce, within a limited time, a <HI>certificate,</HI> from the Briti&s;h <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> or, in his ab&s;ence from &s;ome principal merchants of the foreign port made u&s;e of, of having landed the rice in the manner pre&s;cribed, his bond &s;hall be forfeited.</P>
<P>But this is not all, nor yet half. It is farther enacted, that before taking in the rice, the ma&s;ters of the ve&s;&s;els &s;hall deliver to the collector of the port in Carolina, the abovementioned li|cences and certificates, and make <HI>oath</HI> of their intentions relat|ing to their cargoes; and after going through as many other forms, and &s;ubmitting to as many other re&s;traints, as have been already mentioned, (all which it would be tedious to enume|rate) that they &s;hall pay to the collector or comptroller in Caro|lina,
<Q>the full &s;um for the half-&s;ub&s;idy for all the rice men|tioned in their papers; and in ca&s;e the &s;ame is not paid with|in thirty days after the demand made, the bond &s;hall be forfeited, and &s;hall and may be put in &s;uit, and the per&s;ons bound therein, &s;hall pay <HI>treble co&s;ts.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Ruffhead's Statutes at large, vol. vi.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is the act under which rice may be exported from Caro|lina; and from the foregoing particulars we may be able to judge, what the Congre&s;s <HI>mean</HI> by exporting <HI>rice to Europe.</HI> For unle&s;s they can believe, that the commi&s;&s;ioners of the
<PB N="30" REF="013866_0029_0F925D75C293A718">
cu&s;toms in England will give their <HI>licence</HI> to the Carolina ex|porters, from time to time, to carry <HI>all</HI> their rice to the Euro|pean ports&punc; that are to the &s;outhward of Cape <HI>Fini&s;terre,</HI> their agreement to export <HI>rice to Europe,</HI> mu&s;t imply their <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to export no &s;mall part of it directly to <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; though they attempt ungenerou&s;ly to conceal it from the nothern colo|nies, by a &s;tudied vaguene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ingle out any one act of Parliament, that is more obnoxious for its di&s;play of that parliamentary &s;upre|macy which is denied by the Congre&s;s, than this act which re|gulates the exportation of rice. And yet a quiet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is paid to this act, while others le&s;s exceptionable are oppo&s;ed with &s;uch a &s;pirit of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as threatens the de&s;truction of all the colonies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rice act &s;hews what the opinion of Parliament was forty years ago, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Americans, &s;hews their opinion at that time, concerning the authority of Parliament in American affairs.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the rea&s;on of this partiality is known in part. The De|legates from Carolina were firmly attached to the intere&s;ts of their con&s;tituents, and would not con&s;ent to their immediate ruin. They oppo&s;ed and remon&s;trated with &s;pirit; and rather than they &s;hould be &s;uffered to withdraw them&s;elves from the Congre&s;s, as they threatened, their requi&s;ition was granted. Had the Delegates from this province, who are not &s;u&s;pected of wanting as firm an attachment to our intere&s;ts, been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as intrepid a re&s;olution as their brethren from Carolina, and followed their &s;pirited example; we might have come in too for &s;ome &s;hare of indulgence. But they always &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be borne down by a majority of votes, from the <HI>Repub|licans</HI> of the Ea&s;t, and the <HI>Ari&s;tocratics</HI> of the South; and the con&s;equence is, that we have received no more benefit from an <HI>actual</HI> repre&s;entation in the Congre&s;s, than from a <HI>virtual</HI> one in Parliament.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to point out, and remark upon, all the in&s;tances of the fanciful and whim&s;ical di&s;po&s;ition of the Con|gre&s;s, which appear in their papers: &s;uch as their regulating the expences of <HI>funerals,</HI> but not of <HI>weddings,</HI>&mdash;their making <HI>&s;ump|tuary,</HI> but not <HI>agrarian</HI> laws; the latter of which a majority of the Americans would perhaps like much better, and the expe|diency of which, &s;ome people of New-England, of <HI>levelling</HI> principles, have already taken into con&s;ideration, as I have been credibly informed. But one or two articles more of the <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI> de&s;erve particular notice.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="013866_0030_0F925D76796880B0">In the 12th article, the Committees of Corre&s;pondence are ordered, in their re&s;pective colonies, to
<Q>frequently in&s;pect the entries of their <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es,</HI> and inform each other from time to time of the true &s;tate thereof.</Q>
This is a re&s;o|lution which there can be no pro&s;pect of executing, but by me|thods of violence. For it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the officers of his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms will &s;ubmit their books and papers to the in&s;pection of tho&s;e, who have formed a confederacy to rob the King of his Cu&s;toms. However, the Committee-men, it &s;eems, <HI>mu&s;t in&s;pect</HI> the entries; and if they cannot obtain them by fair means, they mu&s;t get them as they can; or el&s;e this decree of the Congre&s;s cannot be executed.</P>
<P>In the 14th article the Congre&s;s re&s;olve, to have no trade or friendly communication with any colony or province of North-America, which &s;hall not accede or adhere to their <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI>; while they know it is not in the power of &s;everal of them to join in it, however favourable their di&s;po&s;ition may be to &s;uch a junction. This puni&s;hment therefore (for as &s;uch it is intend|ed) is decreed again&s;t tho&s;e who are unque&s;tionably innocent, and again&s;t tho&s;e who may be &s;ome of the be&s;t friends to the general proceedings of the Congre&s;s. And, which is &s;till wor&s;e, this puni&s;hment is to continue, till a complete political revo|lution is effected, till the Briti&s;h Parliament is di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every claim of juri&s;diction over the colonies, and not only till every enumerated obnoxious law re&s;pecting our&s;elves &s;hall be repealed, but till the e&s;tabli&s;hed landmarks and boundaries of one of the King's provinces, which has been lately conquered from the French, &s;hall be altered and removed accord|ing to our dictates. Till the whole of this work is accompli&s;h|ed, the provinces of <HI>Quebec, Nova-Scotia, Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Florida,</HI> mu&s;t all continue under the <HI>ban</HI> of our new Ame|rican <HI>empire:</HI> And none of us are allowed to purcha&s;e &s;o much as a beaver-&s;kin that has been brought acro&s;s any of the lakes, under pain of the penalties to be inflicted on the violaters of the a&s;&s;ociation agreement.</P>
<P>If we turn back from the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> to the <HI>declaration of Rights,</HI> we &s;hall &s;ee the principles of the Congre&s;s, and be able to col|lect &s;ome proofs of their aiming at a total independency. By their demand in the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> it appears, that they mean to emancipate them&s;elves at once from all the Acts of Parliament that have been pa&s;&s;ed under his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. If they &s;uc|ceed in this, they know, that by the &s;ame methods they can clear them&s;elves of all former acts, and become independent; and that this is intended, is probable from &s;ome broad hints which
<PB N="32" REF="013866_0031_0F925D7741B38818">
they drop in their <HI>declaration.</HI> Thus they &s;ay there are many other <HI>infringements and violations</HI> of their <HI>rights,</HI> of a date more ancient than the pre&s;ent reign, which
<Q>we pa&s;s over <HI>for the pre&s;ent,</HI> and proceed to &s;tate &s;uch acts and mea&s;ures as have been adopted &s;ince the la&s;t war.</Q>
So again:
<Q>we have <HI>for the pre&s;ent</HI> only re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the following <HI>peaceable</HI> mea|&s;ures.</Q>
From hence Great-Britain will naturally judge, that granting even all that they demand <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI> will be no &s;ecurity for the future peaceable demeanor of the Colonies; &s;ince inti|mations are here given, that there are many other infringements and violations of their rights, which al&s;o in due time mu&s;t be rectified.</P>
<P>That the views of the Congre&s;s are thus immoderate, is no more than might be naturally expected from a review of their principles, as expre&s;&s;ed in their <HI>declaration</HI>; a full examination of which I &s;hall defer <HI>for the pre&s;ent.</HI> I &s;hall now only take no|tice of a few particulars in this part of their exhibition, which are the mo&s;t glaring and &s;triking.</P>
<P>In their <HI>preamble,</HI> they complain that our A&s;&s;emblies have been frequently di&s;&s;olved, <HI>contrary to the rights</HI> of the Americans.&mdash; This implies, that they claim in behalf of our A&s;&s;emblies, a right not to be di&s;&s;olved, or interrupted, by the King's autho|rity, let the tendency of their temper and proceedings be ever &s;o injurious to the peace and &s;afety of the public. Yet it is an undoubted prerogative of the crown to di&s;&s;olve the Briti&s;h Par|liament, whenever and as often as the intere&s;t of the public is thought to require it. The Congre&s;s therefore will not allow the King to exerci&s;e the &s;ame authority over our American A&s;|&s;emblies, in any of the Colonies, which the con&s;titution allows him to exerci&s;e over the Parliament in England. Thus, we &s;ee, after having rejected all the authority of Parliament over the Colonies, their next attempt is to reduce and farther circum|&s;cribe that of the King.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this part of their plan, the Congre&s;s remon|&s;trate to the King's Governor and General, acting by his imme|diate authority, again&s;t his fortifying the neck of land that leads into Bo&s;ton, and magi&s;terially require him to de&s;i&s;t: Whereas the King has as unque&s;tionable a right to erect for|tre&s;&s;es in any part of his dominions, as to erect <HI>Beacons,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Let the Reader con&s;ult <HI>Black&s;tone's</HI> COMMENTARIES. Lib. 1. Cap. 1. on the King's Prerogative.</NOTE></P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> rights of the Briti&s;h crown, without which the King can be but little better than a cypher, is the
<PB N="33" REF="013866_0032_0F925D7805AB5EC8">
command of the <HI>militia,</HI> and of all the &s;ea and land forces within the Briti&s;h dominions. But in America the Congre&s;s have already wre&s;ted from the King the command of the mili|tia, in one of our large&s;t provinces, and not only &s;o, but they have armed that militia again&s;t him; and unle&s;s he will &s;ub|mit to walk in their leading-&s;trings, he is likely to be treated in the &s;ame manner in the re&s;t of the Colonies,&mdash;Good Heavens! let the province of New-York be excepted.</P>
<P>That he &s;hould have the command of any regular troops in America is thought intollerable; and therefore, the Congre&s;s, in their proceedings of Oct. 14, re&s;olve, <HI>N. C. D.</HI>
<Q>That the keeping a &s;tanding army in the&s;e Colonies, in time of peace, without the con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature of that Colony, in which &s;uch army is kept, is <HI>again&s;t law.</HI></Q>
But this is not enough. They re&s;olve <HI>again,</HI> in the very <HI>&s;ame day,</HI> in the very <HI>&s;ame words</HI>; and print the re&s;olve a <HI>&s;econd</HI> time, <HI>verbatim,</HI> in the proceedings of <HI>that very day,</HI> that it might be &s;ent abroad armed with a double force.</P>
<P>Yet what are we to under&s;tand by the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>again&s;t law,</HI> is not ea&s;y to determine. If they mean by it, contrary to any laws that have been enacted in the Colonies, I conceive, that an attempt to point out &s;uch laws, would puzzle the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>They cannot mean, that it is contrary to acts of Parliament, becau&s;e, they know that the Parliament has provided for the troops in que&s;tion from year to year, for the very purpo&s;e that an army might be kept in America, without having once thought of a&s;king the con&s;ent of the Colonies.</P>
<P>If they mean, contrary to the <HI>common law</HI> of England, the po&s;ition is more than they can defend. They indeed <HI>re&s;olve,</HI> that the Colonies are entitled to the <HI>common law of England</HI>; but if they are not &s;ubject to the <HI>&s;tatute law</HI> of England, they have no more right to the <HI>common law</HI> than the Inhabitants of <HI>Otaheite.</HI> But allowing that the Colonies are entitled to the <HI>common law</HI> of England; yet there is an act of Parliament, now in force, that declares, that the <HI>government</HI> of the military, forces (which includes the <HI>a&s;&s;ignment</HI> of their <HI>po&s;ts</HI> and <HI>&s;tations</HI>) "<HI>within</HI> ALL <HI>his Maje&s;ty's realms and dominions, ever was and is the undoubted right of his Maje&s;ty, and his royal predece&s;&s;ors, the Kings and Queens of England; and that both or either Hou&s;e of Parliament cannot, nor ought to pretend to the &s;ame.</HI>" If this al|ways or <HI>ever was</HI> the ca&s;e, as the act of Parliament a&s;&s;erts; then it is certain that the <HI>common law</HI> of England can afford no pre|tence for this claim of the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>After thus maiming and mangling the regal authority in A|merica, the Congre&s;s, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in order to make
<PB N="34" REF="013866_0033_0F925D78B5FA0610">
&s;ome amends, are willing enough to give it full &s;cope in Eng|land, and even to enlarge it there beyond its natural and con|&s;titutional dimen&s;ions. They apply to the King, and to him only, to relieve them from the obnoxious acts; as if they a&s;|cribed to him a full power of repealing, di&s;pen&s;ing with, or &s;u&s;pending, the laws made by Parliament. But no addre&s;&s;es to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament are prepared, explaining the na|ture and foundation of the demand, and reque&s;ting their con|currence. Does not this imply an opinion, that the King may take upon him&s;elf to do all that is needful, for the relief of the Colonies, without waiting for the approbation or con&s;ent of Parliament? or, mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e, that the repre&s;entatives of America in Congre&s;s, had too much pride to &s;toop to the repre|&s;entatives of a &s;mall European i&s;land in parliament; and that they imagined, that the ho&s;tile preparations made in America, would terrify the Parliament into a compliance with their &s;chemes?</P>
<P>The way being thus prepared, by an entire demolition of the authority of Parliament over the Colonies, and by a diminution of that of the King; the next part of the plan is, to make provi&s;ion for enlarging the authority and dignity of the mem|bers of the Congre&s;s and &s;ome of their friends. This part of the &s;cheme has not yet been expre&s;sly avowed. It is rather too &s;oon to &s;peak plainly to the public; but &s;omething of this &s;ort may be inferred from the tenth Article of the Declaration, which is as follows:</P>
<P><Q>Re&s;olved, N. C. D. It is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to good government, and rendered e&s;&s;ential by the <HI>Engli&s;h con&s;titution,</HI> that the con&s;tituent branches of the Legi&s;lature be indepen|dent of each other; that, therefore, the exerci&s;e of the le|gi&s;lative power in &s;everal Colonies, by a council appointed, <HI>during plea&s;ure,</HI> by the crown, is <HI>uncon&s;titutional,</HI> dangerous, and de&s;tructive to the freedom of American Legi&s;lation.</Q></P>
<P>Here, <HI>Reader, if thou can&s;t but read,</HI> you may &s;ee, that an Ame|rican <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords</HI> is in agitation; in which the members mu&s;t have the &s;ame right, privileges and honours, which the <HI>Eng|li&s;h con&s;titution</HI> has given to the members of the Hou&s;e of Lords in the Mother Country. They mu&s;t be independent of the Crown, and independent of the repre&s;entatives of the people. They mu&s;t continue for life; and according to the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution, their rights and titles mu&s;t de&s;cend to their heirs, law|fully begotten, and from them again, to their heirs, forever and ever. There mu&s;t al&s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, be the &s;ame Orders of the American nobility, that belong to the Engli&s;h; and then none can di&s;pute or que&s;tion, that the gentlemen of the Con|gre&s;s will have a right to the highe&s;t Order.</P>

King William him&s;elf, the immor|tal and true patron both of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical liberty, was of the &s;ame opinion, and appointed coun&s;ellors for this and other Colonies on the &s;ame terms. Notwith&s;tanding, and though the matter is over&s;trained by the Congre&s;s, I have no objections again&s;t an appointment of Coun&s;ellors <HI>during good be|haviour</HI>; and I believe, that the independency of our councils, on the Crown, after their appointment, would be a real im|provement of our Con&s;titution, relating to that branch of our legi&s;lative authority.</P>
<P>While the Congre&s;s a&s;&s;ert, that it is
<Q>indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;a|ry</Q>
to good government, that the con&s;tituent branches of
<PB N="36" REF="013866_0035_0F925D7A371A3380">
the legi&s;lature &s;hould be independent on each other, they &s;tre|nuou&s;ly urge, that the Council in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, &s;hould be re&s;tored to a dependency on the repre&s;entatives of the people. For, according to the tenor of their late charter (a charter which it is thought better that all America &s;hould peri&s;h than not &s;ee replaced) the members of the council are all cho&s;en by the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly; and it depends upon that hou&s;e, whether they &s;hall be confirmed or di&s;placed, at the end of every year. Could the Congre&s;s imagine that &s;uch a dependency as this, on the lowe&s;t branch of the legi&s;lature, will not have as bad an effect on the council, as a dependency on the highe&s;t? If not, why did they di&s;cover &s;uch glaring impartiality? The rea&s;on may be ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed: It is the &s;pirit of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, to depre&s;s the power of the crown, and to exalt the power of the people; and the de&s;ign of it, to prepare the way for introduc|ing and e&s;tabli&s;hing an American Republic, or Ari&s;tocracy, or rather both; the former to the Ea&s;tward, and the latter to the Southward,</P>
<P>It has been long &s;u&s;pected, and indeed pretty well known by &s;ome per&s;ons, that a &s;et of people in the Colonies, who&s;e head quarters are at Bo&s;ton, have for many years been aiming at, and preparing the way for, a government of their own mo|delling, independent of Great Britain, to be erected as &s;oon as the di&s;po&s;ition of the Colonies could be brought to favor the at|tempt. Their machinations, for the mo&s;t part, have been car|ried on in the dark; but yet in the exuberance of their zeal, and in &s;ome of their unguarded moments, they have di&s;covered enough to alarm all the friends of our excellent con&s;titution, and all who e&s;teem the kind and parental protection of the mo|ther country, as e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s and &s;afety of the Colonies.</P>
<P>Near &s;even years ago, a writer, who made much noi&s;e in this city, who was well acquainted with the &s;ecrets of the New-Eng|land republican faction, and whom &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e to have been their agent in this province, in the warmth of an unreined ima|gination, was led to utter more in an apocalyptical &s;train, than was probably intended. While his mind laboured with plea&s;|ing conceptions of the progre&s;s that was making towards an in|dependent American e&s;tabli&s;hment, confident of &s;ucceeding, and regardle&s;s of precautions, he took up his parable, and &s;aid:</P>
<P><Q>Courage then, Americans!&mdash;The finger of God points out a <HI>mighty empire</HI> to your &s;ons.&mdash;We need not be di&s;courag|ed.&mdash;The angry cloud&mdash;will &s;oon be di&s;per&s;ed.&mdash;The <HI>day dawns,</HI> in which the foundation of this mighty empire is to be laid, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a regular American con&s;titu|tion.

<LETTER>
<P>We are not &s;en&s;ible that the &s;tate of America is &s;o alarming, or the State of this province &s;o materially different from what <HI>it was</HI> a few Months &s;ince, as to render the mea&s;ure you propo&s;e, viz. a <HI>provincial convention</HI>) either &s;alutary or nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>And here we propo&s;e to your con&s;ideration, whether the <HI>circular letter,</HI> which gave &s;uch umbrage, containing the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, or others of the like import:
<Q>That the King and parliament, by the late revenue act, had <HI>Infringed</HI> the rights of the colonies, impo&s;ed an <HI>inequitable</HI> tax, and things yet wor&s;e might be expected from the independance and unlimited ap|pointments of crown officers therein mentioned,</Q>
was &s;o perfectly innocent, and entirely con&s;i&s;tent with that duty and loyalty profe&s;&s;ed by the Hou&s;e of Refre&s;entatives the la&s;t year, in their petition to his Maje&s;ty; and whether the la&s;t hou&s;e might not have complied with his Maje&s;ty's requi&s;ition, with a full &s;aving of all their rights and privileges, thereby prevented our being de&s;titute of a general court at this day.</P>
<P>We cannot comprehend what pretence there can be <HI>for</HI> the propo&s;ed <HI>convention,</HI> unle&s;s the probability <HI>of</HI> a con&s;iderable number of regular troops being &s;ent into this province, and an apprehen&s;ion of their being quartered, part in your town and part at the ca&s;tle&mdash;and here we would ob&s;erve, that it was a matter of doubt and uncertainty, whether any were coming or not; if otherwi&s;e, for what purpo&s;e the King was &s;ending them, whether for your defence in ca&s;e of a <HI>French war</HI> (as you tell us there is in the minds of many a prevailing <HI>apprehen&s;ion of one approaching,</HI> and if we do not mi&s;under&s;tand your letter, induced them to pa&s;s the votes tran&s;mitted to us), or whether they are de&s;igned for the protection of the new-acquired territories, is altoge|ther uncertain. That they are to be a &s;tanding army in time of peace, you give us no evidence; and if your apprehen&s;ions are well grounded, it is not even &s;uppo&s;eable they are intended as &s;uch&mdash;and if your town <HI>meant &s;incerely,</HI> we cannot &s;ee the need they had of interpo&s;ing in military matters, in an unprecedented way reque&s;ting their inhabitants to be provided with arms, &amp;c. (a matter till now always &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to another department) e&s;pecially as they mu&s;t know &s;uch a number of troops would be a much better defence, in ca&s;e of war, than they had heretofore been favoured with. To &s;uppo&s;e what you &s;urmi&s;e they may be intended for, is to mi&s;tru&s;t the King's paternal care and goodne&s;s. If by any &s;udden excur&s;ions or in&s;urrections of &s;ome incon|&s;iderate people, the King has been induced to think them a nece&s;&s;ary check upon <HI>you,</HI> we hope you will, <HI>by your loyalty and quiet behaviour</HI> &s;oon <HI>convince his Maje&s;ty,</HI> and the world, they are <HI>not longer nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e</HI>; that thereupon they will be withdrawn, and your town and the province &s;aved any farther trouble and expence from that quarter.</P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible the colonies labour under many difficulties, and we great|ly fear, what the con&s;equences of the di&s;putes with our mother country will prove; however we are far from thinking the mea&s;ures you are pur&s;uing have <HI>any ten|dency</HI> to deliver the good people of this province, but on the contrary, to im|merge them into greater. After all, we &s;hould hope (were it not for your pre|&s;ent attempt, attended with a bad complexion) we might &s;oon have deliverance from our pre&s;ent troubles, and things re&s;tored as at the fir&s;t. The governments have, in our opinion, con&s;ulted, and are pur&s;uing, the propere&s;t methods to ob|tain redre&s;s of their grievances [<HI>In con&s;equence of the u&s;e of the&s;e methods, the duties upon paper, gla&s;s, and pointers colours were taken of.</HI>]; our duty is, to wait with patience the event, unle&s;s we are determined to take the alternative. How far pa&s;&s;ion and <HI>di&s;appointment,</HI> and <HI>private re&s;entment</HI> may <HI>influence any</HI> to hurry their neighbours into &s;uch <HI>mad</HI> and <HI>de&s;perate</HI> mea&s;ures, we don't know, but pray God pevent.</P>
<P>Suffer us to ob&s;erve, that in our opinion, the mea&s;ures the town of Bo&s;ton are pur&s;uing, and propo&s;ing to us, and the people of this province to unite in, are <HI>uncon&s;titutional, illegal,</HI> and <HI>wholly unju&s;tifiable,</HI> and what <HI>will give the enemies of our con&s;titution the greate&s;t joy, &s;ubver&s;ive of government, de&s;tructive of that Peace and good order which is the cement of &s;ociety</HI>; and <HI>have a direct tendency to rivet our chains, and deprive us of our rights and privileges,</HI> which the inhabitants of this town de&s;ire may be &s;ecured to us, and perpetuated to our late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Thus we have freely expre&s;&s;ed our &s;entiments, having an equal right with others, though a le&s;&s;er part of the community, and take this fir&s;t opportunity to <HI>prote&s;t</HI> again&s;t the propo&s;ed <HI>Convention,</HI>&mdash;and hereby declare our <HI>loyalty</HI> to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and <HI>Fidelity to our country</HI>; and that it is our firm re&s;olu|tion, to the utmo&s;t of our power, to maintain and defend our rights in every prudent and rea&s;onable way, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with our duty to God and the King.</P>

&s;ent about the &s;ame time, from
<PB N="38" REF="013866_0037_0F925D808715DF90">
the <HI>Selectmen</HI> of Bo&s;ton to the Selectmen of the <HI>&s;everal towns,</HI> within that province&mdash;and &s;ome other publications of that pe|riod. He will there &s;ee that the <HI>materials</HI> collected were all of
<PB N="39" REF="013866_0038_0F925D8264CFD400">
the right &s;tamp, and excellently calculated to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The writer goes on, and &s;hews that he was well acquainted with the whole de&s;ign of tho&s;e <HI>preparations,</HI> and could tell the very time when the foundation of the "glorious fabrick" was to be publicly laid,
<Q><HI>Before &s;even years</HI> roll over our heads, the fir&s;t &s;tone <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be laid.</Q>
Thus we &s;ee the particular time for beginning this work was then already fixed and determined; and &s;uch <HI>predi&s;po&s;itions</HI> were made, that the event was rendered <HI>indubitable,</HI> in the opinion of the workmen. All the&s;e parti|culars were declared to the public, by the <HI>American Whig,</HI> on the 11th of April, 1768; and his <HI>prophecy</HI> was fully verified by the event. For, we all know, that before the revolution of <HI>&s;even years</HI> was compleated, and exactly at the end of &s;ix years and five months, the fir&s;t &s;tone of the long projected building, actually was laid by the people of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> This corner &s;tone bears an in&s;cription, and the in&s;cription informs us, in CA|PITALS, That it was laid during the admini&s;tration, and un|der the <HI>au&s;pices,</HI> of the late Congre&s;s, then &s;itting, with exqui&s;ite propriety, in <HI>Carpenters-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards this &s;ame writer con&s;iders the intended <HI>American Empire</HI> under the more natural emblem of an image to be made of <HI>clay</HI>; and then he tells us in corre&s;ponding language, that all hands are bri&s;kly at work, mixing and kneading the ingre|dients together, and "<HI>moulding</HI>" the great political ma&s;s into "order."</P>
<P>Now, comparing all this with other appearances and known facts, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible for any judicious per&s;on to doubt, but that there is a &s;et of people among us, di&s;affected to the con&s;ti|tutional &s;upremacy of Great Britain over the&s;e Colonies, who have formed a &s;cheme for e&s;tabli&s;hing an independent govern|ment
<PB N="40" REF="013866_0039_0F925D8298F79618">
or empire in America; and that they have been regularly pur&s;uing it for many years pa&s;t. Nor can it be doubted, but that the late Congre&s;s, though &s;everal of its members perhaps were not admitted to the &s;ecret, was under the influence and di|rection of, and meant nothing le&s;s than to co-operate with, the ma&s;ter builders abovementioned, in making a proper arrange|ment and di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>materials</HI> that were plentifully pro|vided. With this <HI>key,</HI> the aenigmatical proceedings of the Con|gre&s;s may be explained; and what has hitherto appeared to be extravagant and ab&s;urd, will be found to be regular and con&s;i&s;tent. If we con&s;ider them as endeavouring to obtain a reconciliation of Great Britain to the Colonies, on &s;ome gene|rous and honourable plan, their conduct is unaccountable; but if we con&s;ider them as a&s;&s;ociated with, and directed by, the projectors of the <HI>glorious fabric</HI> of an independant American republic, the whole my&s;tery is unriddled; and whatever we may think of their principles or their de&s;igns, we &s;hall have a more favourable opinion of their under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>We have now taken a view of the original de&s;ign of the Con|gre&s;s, and of the authority with which the members were joint|ly and &s;everally ve&s;ted. We have compared their conduct with their in&s;tructions; and have &s;tated the difference between the work propo&s;ed and the work done. And on the review, it ap|pears, that in&s;tead of promoting, they have counter-acted, the de&s;ign of their appointment; that they have altogether neglect|ed the work they were &s;ent upon; that the powers delegated to them by their con&s;tituents, for the good of the colonies, were pro&s;tituted to the purpo&s;es of private ambition; and that all their proceedings as far as we can judge, were in&s;tigated and directed by the New-England republicans, to the utmo&s;t confu|&s;ion of the Colonies, the di&s;grace of their con&s;tituents, and their own infamy.</P>
<P>It cannot therefore remain a que&s;tion one moment, whether we are under obligations to adopt and pur&s;ue the mea&s;ures they have pre&s;cribed, or not; we manife&s;tly owe them no obedience at all; we owe them no re&s;pect as a body: Much le&s;s are we bound to plunge our&s;elves headlong into that aby&s;s of mi&s;ery and de&s;truction which they have opened; an aby&s;s, which in|deed mu&s;t &s;oon &s;wallow us up, unle&s;s we re&s;olve to proceed in direct oppo&s;ition to the impul&s;es and in&s;tigations, with which they and their adherents endeavour to pu&s;h us on.</P>
<P>Rebellion and civil war are the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of our being governed by the Congre&s;s. They are the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> tho' not perhaps the <HI>immediate</HI> con&s;equence. For we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that Great Britain, con&s;cious of her own &s;uperior &s;trength, and
<PB N="41" REF="013866_0040_0F925D854BE6F388">
jealous of her rights, will meanly put up with our wanton in|&s;ults; or that &s;he will be &s;o intimidated with any threatenings of ours, as to &s;acrifice at once her own dignity, honour and in|tere&s;t, at the &s;hrine of <HI>Carpenters-Hall,</HI> in Philadelphia. Such conduct would render her a laughing-&s;tock to all Europe, and cau&s;e the Americans them&s;elves mo&s;t heartily to de&s;pi&s;e her.</P>
<P>I have too good an opinion of the wi&s;dom, di&s;cretion and loyalty of the inhabitants of this province in general, to be|lieve that any &s;ophi&s;try can mi&s;lead them, that any in&s;idious arts can &s;educe them to engage in the execution of the <HI>mo&s;t violent</HI> part of the plan recommended by the Congre&s;s; which is to &s;upport the <HI>rebellion</HI> in New-England with their lives and for|tunes, to the irrecoverable ruin of their families. To under|take &s;uch a frantic adventure, mu&s;t be the bu&s;ine&s;s only of fools or fanaticks, and is contrary to the prevailing di&s;po&s;ition of this &s;en&s;ible and &s;ober province.</P>
<P>But as to the le&s;s horrible part of the plan, which is contain|ed in the <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI>; the danger of adopting it is greater, be|cau&s;e its appearance is le&s;s tremendous. And yet when we con|&s;ider, that we are under no obligations to the Congre&s;s, that we are at perfect liberty to judge for our&s;elves, and to con&s;ult our own happine&s;s, as if the Congre&s;s had never exi&s;ted, and that our condition would &s;oon become inexpre&s;&s;ibly mi&s;erable by pur&s;uing even this part of the &s;cheme; I hope we &s;hall have the prudence and grace to avoid it.</P>
<P>It has generally been thought, and is now pretty well known, that our re&s;olving to import nothing from Great Britain, will produce another act of Parliament for &s;hutting up our ports; and that our commerce will be at a total &s;tand, till the re&s;olution is recalled, in &s;uch a way as will be acceptable. Now, if the operation of &s;uch an act upon the &s;ingle town of Bo&s;ton only, has brought &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s upon &s;o many of its inhabitants, that all America has been obliged to contribute to their relief; we may judge in what manner we &s;hall be affected by the &s;hut|ting up of this port, while all the neighbouring ports will be in the &s;ame condition, and our poor will have no pro&s;pect of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from any of the other Colonies.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that we can hold out, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, for any con&s;iderable time. According to the common cour&s;e of things, we &s;hall be obliged at la&s;t to &s;ubmit to the authority of Great-Britain; and then, after a conte&s;t of this kind, &s;he will have a right to e&s;tabli&s;h new and le&s;s favourable terms for us, with which notwith&s;tanding we &s;hall readily comply, as they will be the only conditions of peace and &s;afety. So that this non-importation project, in&s;tead of relieving us from par|liamentary
<PB N="42" REF="013866_0041_0F925D87353AE460">
taxation, will in the end, naturally and almo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily, cau&s;e it to fall upon us with more than double weight.</P>
<P>In &s;hort: If we regard the Congre&s;s at all, we &s;hall bitterly repent it. But if we have recour&s;e to our legal repre&s;entatives, allow them their due honour and influence, and under their di|rection pur&s;ue only <HI>prudent</HI> and <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> mea&s;ures, it will undoubtedly prove, in a more proper &s;en&s;e than the word has commonly been u&s;ed in, the <HI>&s;alvation</HI> of this province.</P>
<P>If our pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embly &s;hould refu&s;e to act a worthy part, on this occa&s;ion, which I can hardly &s;u&s;pect that they will; we mu&s;t, for the pre&s;ent, bear it with as much patience as we can, con&s;i&s;tently with our duty;&mdash;looking forward to the time, which in that ca&s;e will be ha&s;tened when we &s;hall have an op|portunity of a new choice, and when it will be our own faults, if we are not repre&s;ented by men, who will pay a proper regard to the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>Let us then, my friends and fellow-&s;ubjects of this province, withdraw our&s;elves immediately from within the <HI>vortex</HI> of the Congre&s;s&mdash;that we may be at liberty to pur&s;ue the real good of our country, under the friendly direction of the law and &s;ound policy. Let us di&s;band our Committees, but without any per&s;onal reproaches or reflexions on account of what is pa&s;t; and, for the future, like men of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, let us &s;corn to yield any obedience but to the laws and to lawful authority. In &s;eeking for the redre&s;s of our grievances, let us neither practice nor countenance any violent methods, till mild and &s;afe ones &s;hall have been fairly tried, and found to be ineffectual. If our ca&s;e cannot be bettered, let us be careful however not to render it wor&s;e, by our own mi&s;management. If we &s;hould be unable immediately to procure an exemption from the au|thority of Parliament; yet that is no rea&s;on for our not &s;ecuring to our&s;elves as much liberty as we can; and, in order to that, we mu&s;t re&s;cue our necks from the <HI>yoke</HI> of the Congre&s;s, and our legs 2nd arms from the <HI>fetters</HI> of Committees. This is the bondage we have mo&s;t rea&s;on to dread, as it is equally oppre&s;|&s;ive and di&s;graceful.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, permit me, in a few words, to addre&s;s <HI>you,</HI> Gentlemen, who are authori&s;ed to <HI>repre&s;ent</HI> the free-holders of this province, in the HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</P>
<P>After hearing &s;o much of <HI>Congre&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Committees,</HI> it gives me peculiar plea&s;ure to con&s;ider, that our con&s;titution is not yet di&s;&s;olved, that our legal repre&s;entatives are not yet di&s;carded, that they are now met together in their legi&s;lative capacity, and that their authority may &s;till be vigorou&s;ly exerted. It is to you, Gentlemen, that I would per&s;uade my fellow-&s;ubjects of

this province to have recour&s;e, at this time of difficulty and danger, and not to any power that is foreign and uncon&s;titu|tional.</P>
<P>I will venture to &s;ay, that neither you nor your predece&s;&s;ors have ever met together at &s;o critical a &s;ea&s;on as the pre&s;ent; that &s;o much has never depended on the wi&s;dom of your deter|minations; and that you have never had &s;uch a call for the full exertion of your united abilities.</P>
<P>The people whom you repre&s;ent are dreadfully perplexed, embarra&s;&s;ed and divided. They know not what mea&s;ures to pur&s;ue, to obtain &s;afety. If your wi&s;dom and prudence can procure for them an adequate relief, you will henceforward be loved and revered as &s;o many guardian angels to your country, and your names will be tran&s;mitted with peculiar lu&s;tre, in the annals both of Great-Britain and her colonies, to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Although &s;ome of you are partly indebted to my <HI>vote,</HI> and much more to my influence, for &s;eats in your honourable hou&s;e; yet I pre&s;ume not to dictate to any of you, nor would I <HI>obtrude</HI> my advice upon your re&s;pectable body. But, convinced that you are willing to hear the opinion of any con&s;tituent, who de|&s;ires to offer it, with becoming deference, on a &s;ubject that de|mands the attention of all; I beg your indulgence for a few moments.</P>
<P>You will undoubtedly be urged by many, to give your &s;anc|tion to the proceedings of the late Congre&s;s; and the example of &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies on this continent will be propo&s;ed, to in|duce your compliance. But do not forget, Gentlemen, the nature and dignity of your own &s;tation, and of the tru&s;t that is repo&s;ed in you. <HI>You</HI> are the lawful and proper guardians of our rights and liberties; and you have &s;olemnly engaged your|&s;elves to guard them, whenever they are invaded or expo&s;ed. In this honorable and important work, you are not to be go|verned by the <HI>example of others</HI>; but you are expected to act with a &s;pirit of independency and freedom, that is worthy of your political character. The law, and <HI>your own</HI> wi&s;dom, are to be your only guides; and the happine&s;s of the province is to be your only mark. The con&s;titution is the ground you &s;tand on, and while you adhere to it, it will be your &s;upport. But the moment you quit this ground, you are un&s;afe; as &s;oon as ever you pur&s;ue or countenance uncon&s;titutional mea&s;ures, you expo&s;e your&s;elves, you injure us, you de&s;ert your &s;tation, you betray your tru&s;t.</P>
<P>If you give your &s;anction to the proceedings of the Congre&s;s in general terms, and without exceptions, as &s;ome other a&s;&s;em|blies
<PB N="44" REF="013866_0043_0F925D8886227710">
have done; you will, like them, become an&s;werable for the guilt of &s;uch proceedings, as are contrary to law and &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the con&s;titution. You will then be nece&s;&s;arily under|&s;tood to approve of the <HI>approbation</HI> of the Congre&s;s, to recom|mend their <HI>recommendations,</HI> and con&s;equently to approve of and recommend all the <HI>rebellious</HI> tran&s;actions of the people of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> Are you willing, Gentlemen, to be con&s;idered in this light? Can you, who are the repre&s;entatives and legi&s;lators of one of the fir&s;t provinces in America, of a province which has hitherto been re&s;pected for its loyalty and &s;ound policy, think of de|grading your&s;elves &s;o far below your proper rank, as to become the <HI>rear-guard</HI> of a faction again&s;t that &s;upreme power, which pre&s;ides over, and mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity govern the whole Briti&s;h Empire? Forbid it, Honour! Forbid it, Decency! We do not think &s;o contemptuou&s;ly of you, as to believe it is po&s;&s;ible. We &s;hould be extremely unhappy at &s;uch a time as this, if we had not great confidence in your firmne&s;s and &s;teadine&s;s, and in your di&s;po&s;ition to &s;upport your own dignity and the real inte|re&s;ts of the province.</P>
<P>There is no occa&s;ion for entering into a detail of circum&s;tan|ces, which all are acquainted with. However it may be proper to ob&s;erve to you, Gentlemen, that though your con&s;tituents in general are willing to allow, that hitherto they have not been <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> by the power of the Briti&s;h Parliament; yet, that they imagine there is rea&s;on to complain of &s;ome late acts, as viola|tions of their con&s;titutional liberty. In this ca&s;e, a &s;ilent &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, they think, would have a dangerous tendency; and the continuance of tho&s;e acts, they believe, would be productive of evil, both to the mother country and her American colonies. They wi&s;h therefore, from the mo&s;t generous motives, that all &s;uch acts may be repealed, and, at the &s;ame time, that a barrier may be fixed between the &s;upremacy of Great-Britain and the rights of the Americans, in &s;uch a manner, and on &s;uch equit|able principles, that hereafter no infringements may be made, and that no jealou&s;ies may be likely to ari&s;e, on either &s;ide. They conceive, that now is the proper time for this &s;ettlement to be made on a la&s;ting ba&s;is, and that you are the only proper per&s;ons to appear in behalf of this province. They have le|gally deputed you to act in their &s;tead, and they rely on your wi&s;dom, caution and prudence to conduct a concern of &s;uch great importance and delicacy.</P>
<P>Of the different methods that have been propo&s;ed for obtain|ing the end in view, &s;ome are unque&s;tionably right, and &s;ome wrong. If any doubts can remain with you, Gentlemen, con|cerning what is right or wrong in this ca&s;e; you will naturally
<PB N="45" REF="013866_0044_0F925D8941681798">
think it expedient, before you determine which methods to pur&s;ue, to examine the matter carefully and impartially, that you may not be mi&s;led by any error of judgment. In this in|quiry you will attend to the true merits of the cau&s;e, and found your determination on evidence ari&s;ing from the nature of the ca&s;e, and the fitne&s;s of things; without &s;eeing with other men's eyes, or &s;uffering your&s;elves to be warped by other men's opi|nions. For, we humbly conceive, that you are bound, by the nature of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you, to act according to the un|bia&s;&s;ed direction of <HI>your own</HI> judgment, and not according to the contrary opinions of any people whatever.</P>
<P>If then you believe that the Congre&s;s acted wrong, or that they might have taken more prudent or &s;afe mea&s;ures, in order to &s;ecure the rights of the colonies, as I am per&s;uaded that you do; it then clearly follows, that you are bound in honour, and in duty to your con&s;tituents, to reject what appears to be wrong, and to pro&s;ecute tho&s;e mea&s;ures which appear in them|&s;elves to be mo&s;t prudent and &s;afe. He that can he&s;itate a moment in &s;o clear a ca&s;e, is not worthy to repre&s;ent a virtuous and well-meaning people.</P>
<P>I know very well the difficulty that will pre&s;s you. The genero&s;ity of your di&s;po&s;ition will render it di&s;agreeable and painful to you, to act on a plan that is not only &s;eparate, but e&s;&s;entially different from that which has been generally adopted by the other colonies; and perhaps you are afraid of being &s;tigmatized as traitors to the common cau&s;e of America. I would by no means altogether condemn &s;uch feelings; they are generous and honourable, when duly regulated. But truth, propriety and rea&s;on, are always entitled to our <HI>fir&s;t</HI> regard; to a regard, which mu&s;t not give way to more private affections.</P>
<P>The neighbouring governments are con&s;idered by this as <HI>&s;i&s;ter colonies</HI>; and as &s;uch we have always loved them with &s;incere affections, and we are de&s;irous of promoting their inte|re&s;ts whenever we can, con&s;i&s;tently with our own. But the mo&s;t favourite &s;i&s;ter is not to be ju&s;tified or &s;upported, in doing what is evidently wrong. If the other colonies are ju&s;tly con|&s;idered by this as <HI>&s;i&s;ters,</HI> we &s;hould remember too, that, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, England is to be con&s;idered as its <HI>mother</HI>; and the natural connexion is much &s;tronger between a child and its parent, than it can be between a &s;i&s;ter and &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>To pur&s;ue the metaphor a little farther. If we &s;ee our &s;i&s;ters be taking them&s;elves to wrong cour&s;es, we &s;hould endeavour to reclaim them, by affectionate admonitions, and e&s;pecially by a <HI>good example.</HI> This will be much more to our honour, and finally more to their advantage, than if we encourage them to
<PB N="46" REF="013866_0045_0F925D8A07248978">
go on by our weak compliances. The&s;e &s;i&s;ters of ours, of whom we are &s;peaking, are allowed to have many good quali|ties, for which we e&s;teem them. They are naturally good-tempered; but for &s;ome time pa&s;t they have been in an ill humour, and they are perpetually quarrelling with our mother, a venerable and worthy lady, but not intirely without foibles. The beginning of the di&s;pute was tolerably decent; but they now go on like a parcel of &s;aucy and impudent hu&s;&s;ies, threat|ning and abu&s;ing her; and they in&s;i&s;t upon it, that &s;he &s;hall fall down upon her knees, and publickly a&s;k their pardon&mdash;for having lately exerci&s;ed &s;uch an authority over them as &s;he al|ways u&s;ed to exerci&s;e, and in &s;uch a way as &s;he thinks is war|ranted by the laws of the land. It has been propo&s;ed to the&s;e daughters, to try if the matter in di&s;pute with their mother cannot be &s;ettled in an amicable conference. But no; they &s;wear and prote&s;t, that they will not exchange a &s;ingle word with her in that way; but that they will &s;tab the <HI>old hag</HI> to the heart, or &s;tarve her to death, but they will force her to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Such, Gentlemen, I conceive, is the conduct of our &s;i&s;ter colonies at this time, with regard to our common and venera|ble parent. Such is their conduct towards her, though they know that they are &s;till greatly dependent on her, and that &s;he has a &s;ufficient number of dutiful and brave &s;ons, who are re&s;olutely determined to revenge her quarrel, and maintain her authority. The que&s;tion then is, whether this province &s;hall act, unbia&s;&s;ed by partial affections, according to its own real judgment and principles, or not: Or, whether &s;he &s;hall enter upon a cour&s;e of extravagant, profligate and dangerous prac|tices, merely in compliance with a termigant <HI>&s;i&s;terhood,</HI> that has been lately deluded and debauched, and rendered almo&s;t de&s;perate by the Congre&s;s? To this que&s;tion you will certainly give an unanimous negative. If you act at all in this matter, it will be on a different plan, and mere conformably to the general opinion of the freeholders in the province.</P>
<P>But, for God's &s;ake, Gentlemen, why &s;hould you not act? Will it ju&s;tify inactivity in you, that others are acting wrongly? Are you afraid or a&s;hamed of appearing &s;ingular in doing what is right? You mu&s;t know, that &s;ingularity in right con|duct will be an honour to you, and a &s;hame only to them that act otherwi&s;e&punc; If you mean that the grievances you complain of, &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be redre&s;&s;ed; &s;omething &s;hould be done to promote the redre&s;s of them; for it is not to be expected, that they will redre&s;s them&s;elves. If you aim at the end, common &s;en&s;e requires you to u&s;e &s;uch means as are mo&s;t likely
<PB N="47" REF="013866_0046_0F925D8AC5790040">
to effect it. Such means as were mo&s;t proper before the meet|ing of the Congre&s;s, are mo&s;t proper &s;till; for, with all their a&s;&s;umed powers, they were not able to alter the nature of things.</P>
<P>Let it then be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, after providing for the immediate exigencies of this province, to do what ought to be done by every province on the continent; that is to pre|pare and tran&s;mit proper addre&s;&s;es to the King, Lords and Commons of Great-Britain; decently &s;tating your whole claims, and dutifully reque&s;ting that they may &s;peedily be confirmed to you. Addre&s;&s;es from your body will be received and regarded; which is a greater honour than could have been allowed to addre&s;&s;es from the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>In your addre&s;&s;es declare, that you act in behalf of a loyal province, which you con&s;titutionally repre&s;ent, and that you have no connection with the late Congre&s;s. Candidly and generou&s;ly confe&s;s, that a mi&s;taken zeal for liberty has pro|duced among us &s;ome tumultuous and di&s;orderly proceedings, which are not to be ju&s;tified, Beg that all the&s;e things may be buried in oblivion, and that there may be no repeating of pa&s;t grievances. Profe&s;s, in your own names and in ours, loyalty and allegiance to the King in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; and expre&s;s our willingne&s;s to acknowledge the &s;upremacy of Great Britain in all ca&s;es, excepting tho&s;e of taxation. Give a&s;&s;ur|ances that we dread the very thoughts of an ab&s;olute indepen|dency; and that we &s;ee no pro&s;pect of &s;ecurity or happine&s;s, but under the powerful protection and mild &s;uperintendency of the mother country.</P>
<P>In con&s;ideration of our being indulged with the favours re|que&s;ted, &s;ignify your willingne&s;s to bind your&s;elves and your con&s;tituents to rai&s;e annually, without any deduction, &s;uch a &s;um as may be thought equitable, for the general &s;upport of government; and promi&s;e, at the &s;ame time, that this province will always pay due regard to his Maje&s;ty's farther requi&s;itions, in ca&s;es of emergency. In &s;hort, propo&s;e and &s;ay whatever you may think proper; only be careful that your addre&s;&s;es be duti|ful, your reque&s;ts rea&s;onable, and your offers generous; and then, I doubt not but this province will be received by the mo|ther country with open arms.</P>
<P>In this way, you will effectually provide for the happine&s;s and &s;ecurity of the people whom you repre&s;ent, and probably contribute, in no &s;mall degree, to the general happine&s;s of America. All good members of &s;ociety within the Briti&s;h empire will e&s;teem and re&s;pect you; and none will blame or reproach you but tho&s;e turbulent &s;pirits, who&s;e cen&s;ures are much more de&s;irable than their prai&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="013866_0047_0F925D8B87C2E488">Before I withdraw, &s;uffer me to remind you, Gentlemen, that, in this province, the friends to peace and political mode|ration have always been more than twenty to one; and to a&s;&s;ure you, that their numbers are daily increa&s;ing. Every day confirms them in their opinion. There is no danger of their falling off; they under&s;tand one another; they have formed their judgment on conviction; they are connected by princi|ple; they are animated by the con&s;ideration both of public and private intere&s;t; and they now compo&s;e a body, which, notwith&s;tanding any dome&s;tic a&s;&s;aults they may meet with, will not be di&s;ordered, but will remain as firm and impenetrable as the Macedonian <HI>Phalanx.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude. I have offered my &s;entiments on a que&s;tion of the utmo&s;t importance to the colonies, with that plainne&s;s and freedom which every Engli&s;hman, in &s;uch ca&s;es, has a right to u&s;e. The real good of my country, was the &s;incere aim of this inquiry. If I &s;hould be thought to have &s;poken too har&s;hly of the late Congre&s;s, this mu&s;t be my apology: It was an object that appeared to me in every view, hideous and dete&s;tible. I meant no per&s;onal reflections on any of its members, as has been intimated before; I re&s;pect &s;uch of them as I have any particular knowledge of. My mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h is for the happine&s;s of America. I con&s;ider Great-Britain and her colonies, with her other dependencies, as but one body, which mu&s;t be affected throughout by the &s;ufferings of any par|ticular member. I con&s;ider them as con&s;tituting one great and illu&s;trious family, to which I have the honour to belong; and I pray that its tranquillity may be &s;peedily re&s;tored, and that peace and harmony may forever reign through every part of it. Government and good order are its &s;trength; Liberty, civil and religious, is its glory. Every thing that contributes to its reputation and happine&s;s, I love; every thing that tends to di&s;tre&s;s or di&s;grace it, I abhor. For this rea&s;on I abhor the late Congre&s;s. Its fir&s;t appearance rai&s;ed our curio&s;ity, but excited no terror. But it was not long, before it turned out to be a perfect mon&s;ter,&mdash;a <HI>mad, blind</HI> mon&s;ter!</P>
