<P>The poor Young man, before as well as after his <HI>Trial,</HI> was in &s;uch a pen&s;ive Conditi|on, as was agreeable to one under the Expec|tation of what was now coming upon him.

<P>In this Time, the Mini&s;ters of the Town, with all &s;uitable Compa&s;&s;ion and A&s;&s;iduity, Vi&s;ited him, and In&s;tructed him, and Pray'd with him; and not only u&s;ed more private Endeavours to prepare him for his Death but al&s;o pur&s;ued the &s;ame Intention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> publickly, when he had Liberty which was readily granted him, to attend in our publick A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e Cultivations, he was brought unto &s;uch Thoughts and Frames, and he took his opportunities to declare &s;uch Things, as the Reader will find related in the En&s;uing Sermon. He al&s;o declared, That he could not without wonder now Look back on a ve|ry odd thing in his former Life; which was, <Q>That he had abundance of Times, when only &s;porting with the Young man, he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Murdered, let fall the&s;e words to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>I &s;hall one day be hang'd for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me for &s;aying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></Q> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could give no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Impre&s;&s;ion; but now found

<P>The <HI>Twenty fourth</HI> day of <HI>September</HI> arrived, when the poor Young man, having been fir&s;t in&s;tructed with a mo&s;t Pertinent and Excellent Sermon, on P&s;al.

<P>A Mini&s;ter of the Town, &s;o far gratified the Importunity of his de&s;ire for it, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him, for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the&s;e la&s;t Minutes of his Life.</P>
<P>The Young man Expre&s;s'd all the pious and proper Frames, that his be&s;t Friends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have wi&s;hed for him; and &s;uch as I hope, were a good Harve&s;t, of the Pains and Prayers and Tears, wherewith Good men had been Labouring for his Welfare.</P>
<P>I will &s;ingle out only Two or Three Pa&s;|&s;ages, of what occurr'd in the Conver&s;ation, (which could not be much) by the way.</P>

Another time, the Mini&s;ter a&s;king him, <HI>Is not the Terror of the Death ju&s;t now before you, too hard for you?</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>No, not at all; my Hope in the Mercy of God has overcome it.</HI></P>
<P>He al&s;o declared, <HI>That his Hope was founded in the Blood of his Great Saviour &s;hed for him, &amp; in the Wonderful Mercy of God which allowed and invited the chief of Sinners, to plead this Blood, &amp; the Wonderful Mercy of the Saviour, who will ca&s;t out none of tho&s;e that come to him: And that the Effect of this Hope in him was, Hatred of all Sin more than ever, &amp; a De&s;ire to do all the good that was po&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>He likewi&s;e declared, <HI>That the nearer he drew to his End, the more he grew in his Hope.</HI></P>

<P>It is a &s;trange Occurrence that my Text refers unto. The Father of the <HI>Faithful,</HI> once and again falling into the Errors of <HI>Unbelief.</HI> His Life was filled with <HI>Trials;</HI> But in them all, the <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> of the Glorious God unto His Promi&s;es, was marvellou&s;ly illu&s;tra|ted.

dealing,</HI> as he &s;hould have done. The Compa&s;&s;ion of God unto His Poor, Frail, Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Servant on this occa|&s;ion was wonderful!

<P>Two things now demand a mo&s;t af|fectionate Con&s;ideration with us; Fir&s;t the <HI>Method,</HI> and then the <HI>Mercy,</HI> of this Happine&s;s, <HI>I with-held thee from Sin|ning against me.</HI></P>
<P>I. The <HI>Method</HI> of our Good God, in <HI>With-holding us from Sinning against him;</HI> This is various, and curious, and has many Wonders in it. We will take the Surprizing Subject into our Con|templation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; Our Good God <HI>With-holds</HI> the <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> of <HI>Sin;</HI> This is one <HI>Method</HI> in which <HI>He with|holds us from Sinning again&s;t him</HI> There is an Army of <HI>Evil Spirits,</HI> united un|der one Leader, for which cau&s;e they all go under the &s;ingle Name of, <HI>Sa|ran,</HI> or, <HI>The Devil.</HI> The De&s;ign of the&s;e <HI>Evil Spirits,</HI> is to Tempt us unto <HI>Sin,</HI> that &s;o they may by their <HI>Temptations</HI> bring us under <HI>their Condemnation.</HI> Our <HI>Tempter,</HI> the <HI>Devil, goes about,</HI> &s;eeking
<PB N="7" REF="001626_0023_0FB3E0C865891D98">
whom he may Deceive into Sin, &amp; by Deceiving <HI>Devour</HI> them. As our Lord &s;aid, Luk. XXII. 31. <HI>Simon, Simon, Sa|tan hath de&s;ired to have you, that he may &s;ift you:</HI> So may it more or le&s;s be &s;aid, about every man in the World; <HI>Sinner, Sinner, Satan the Tempter hath de&s;ired, that he may have thee, to Tempt thee unto &s;ome undoing Wickedne&s;s.</HI> In|deed <HI>Satan</HI> mu&s;t have the permi&s;&s;ion of God for it, before he can fall upon us. But now our God very often does not permit <HI>Satan,</HI> to Tempt us with &s;uch Fury, and &s;uch Succe&s;s, as he would otherwi&s;e a&s;&s;ault us withal. Our God has the Tempter in a <HI>Chain;</HI> He holds in the <HI>Ty-'Dog.</HI> He <HI>with|holds</HI> the <HI>Tempter</HI> from En&s;naring of us, and thereby He <HI>witholds</HI> us from falling into the <HI>Snare of the Wicked.</HI> There are <HI>People &s;et upon mi&s;chief.</HI> 'Tis very &s;trange that they do no more. 'Tis becau&s;e God <HI>Chains up the Devil,</HI> and won't let him &s;ugge&s;t unto them, what they may do. Our <HI>Indians</HI> had el&s;e done a thou&s;and times more mi&s;chief,
<PB N="8" REF="001626_0024_0FB3E0CAFA27F468">
than they have, to our Plantations. This <HI>World</HI> is al&s;o full of tho&s;e Things, which are the <HI>Occa&s;ions,</HI> the <HI>Incentives,</HI> the <HI>Inducements</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> The <HI>Stumbling Block: of Iniquity</HI> do even fill the World. But our God <HI>with-holds us from Sin,</HI> by <HI>with-holding</HI> from us, tho&s;e things that would <HI>provoke</HI> us to Sin. He takes the <HI>Stumbling-blocks</HI> out of our way, &amp; <HI>&s;o witholds</HI> us from Falling into Sin upon them. Our God <HI>witholds</HI> us from the exorbitant Out-breakings of the <HI>Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Lust of the Eye,</HI> and the <HI>Pride of Life,</HI> by <HI>with|holding</HI> from us the Objects, that are the <HI>Fuel</HI> of them. We &s;ay, <HI>'Tis oppor|tunity that makes a Thief.</HI> Our God <HI>witholds</HI> many a man from many a <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t</HI> &amp; other Sins by this; He won't give him an <HI>Opportunity.</HI> He won't give <HI>Riches</HI> to one man; and &s;o the man is <HI>witheld</HI> from the <HI>Denying of God.</HI> He won't pinch another man with <HI>Poverty;</HI> and &s;o the man is <HI>witheld</HI> from <HI>Taking the Name of God in vain.</HI> If God &s;hould order for man, &s;ome, <HI>Conditions,</HI> &amp; &s;ome

<HI>Employments,</HI> &amp; &s;ome <HI>Companions,</HI> which He <HI>witholds</HI> from them, Verily, they would be drawn into abundance of Sin, more than they are.</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Diverting</HI> of us from Sin, by the Good Hand of God, this is one <HI>Method</HI> u&s;ed by our Good God in <HI>witholding</HI> us from Sin. We &s;hould Sin more than we do, but our God <HI>witholds</HI> us, by finding &s;omething el&s;e for us to do. One gave this agreea|ble Account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> how he kept his Inno|cency; <HI>The Devil don't find me at Lie|&s;ure, to do what he would have me to do.</HI> Infuriated <HI>Saul</HI> would have Embrued his hands in the Blood of a Servant of God, but <HI>God call'd him off!</HI> We read, 1 Sam.

Many &s;uch a <HI>Me&s;&s;enger</HI> comes unto us from God, that calls us another way, when we are ju&s;t upon &s;ome &s;inful perpetrations. The <HI>Flood</HI> &s;eems to have been as notable, as General, an Example of this Ob&s;ervation. The

<HI>Cur&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Flood,</HI> is in this turn'd in|to a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> on the World.

<P>And our God, by ordering a <HI>Good Education</HI> for us, keeps our <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> in a more <HI>Wakeful</HI> and <HI>Active</HI> Plight; &s;o that we cannot get over the <HI>Checks</HI> which it gives unto us. This <HI>Light within,</HI> tho' it be &s;o darkened that it is not a <HI>&s;ufficient Guide unto Life,</HI> yet it &s;hows us, many <HI>Fair</HI> Things, and like a <HI>Fire</HI> it &s;calds us if we do any <HI>Foul</HI> ones.

You are very much to Blame, if you are not very <HI>Thankful</HI> for &s;uch Deliverances; <HI>Unholy,</HI> if <HI>Unthank|ful!</HI> But are you <HI>Thankful</HI> that you have been <HI>Witheld from Sinning</HI> again&s;t the Glorious GOD? This, O Redeemed Ones, This is a greater Cau&s;e for <HI>Thank&s;|giving,</HI> than any of the re&s;t. It may be, &s;ome of you have been all your Dayes hitherto upheld, and <HI>witheld</HI> from doing any Thing, of a <HI>Scandalous</HI> A&s;pect; Like the Young man in the Go&s;pel, You have been <HI>kept from your Youth up,</HI> from every Thing that may be called, <HI>Scandalous.</HI> Oh! Be very Thankful, for &s;o rare a <HI>Mercy;</HI> &s;o rich a <HI>Mercy!</HI> Or, if not &s;o,
<PB N="28" REF="001626_0044_0FB3E0EAE211CD40">
yet you have been <HI>witheld</HI> from &s;uch <HI>Scandals</HI> as you have &s;een <HI>Others</HI> fall in|to. God has not Left you to make your &s;elves <HI>Prodigies</HI> of Sin; God has not hang'd you up in Chains, among the <HI>Mo|numents of his Wrath;</HI> Others no wor&s;e by Nature than you, have been &s;o.

Yea, My Hearers, I believe there are very few of you, but what may call to mind, that you have been at &s;ome Time or other, ju&s;t upon the point of doing &s;ome very <HI>horrible Thing!</HI> You have been very violently pu&s;h'd on, to do &s;ome <HI>horrible Thing,</HI> which if it had been <HI>done,</HI> you had been the mo&s;t <HI>Undone</HI> Things in the World; <HI>Undone for Both Worlds!</HI> You may make that Report; P&s;al. LXXIII. 2. <HI>As for me, my Feet were almo&s;t gone, my &s;teps had will-nigh, &s;lipt.</HI> But God &s;tept in, and &s;aved you. O fall down before the Lord, and thankfully admire &s;o obliging a <HI>Mer|cy;</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>Ble&s;s the Lord, O my Soul; I ble&s;s thee, O my God, for thou ha&s;t deli|vered my Soul, in delivering my Feet from the Falls I have been &s;o near unto!</HI></P>
<P>I will make Two Remarks on the Gratitude which is now called for. The
<PB N="29" REF="001626_0045_0FB3E0EC603D18F8">
One is this; In this thing it may &s;o fall out, that you may give a &s;hining Demon&s;tration of your <HI>Sincerity</HI> before the Lord. It may be, 'tis by &s;ome &s;ore and &s;harp <HI>Affliction</HI> upon you, that God has <HI>Witheld you from Sinning again&s;t Him.</HI> Well, Can you now &s;o far heartily give Thanks to God for this <HI>Affliction;</HI> and can you heartily &s;ay, <HI>Lord, I ble&s;s thee, that thou woul|de&s;t rather, bind me in Affliction and Iron, and bring down my Heart with Labour, then let me run Loo&s;e in the broad way that Leads unto De&s;truction!</HI> He was a Saint of God, who could &s;ay; P&s;al. CXIX. 67, 71. <HI>Before I was afflicted, I went a&s;tray; but now I have kept thy Word. It is good for me, that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy Statutes.</HI> O Thou Sin-hating Soul; This would be a mark of <HI>Sincerity,</HI> that would have no le&s;s than on <HI>Evi|dent Token of Salvation</HI> in it. The O|ther is this; You mu&s;t not fall into a Dream, that a <HI>Negative Religion,</HI> will be enough to &s;ecure your Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s. Many men, becau&s;e they have been <HI>Witheld</HI> from &s;uch Things as ma|ny others are chargeable withal, they fancy they have <HI>Religion</HI> enough. They
<PB N="30" REF="001626_0046_0FB3E0EDE7D5E428">
can &s;ay, <HI>I am not as other men, or as this Publican,</HI> and they fancy here is <HI>Religion</HI> enough to put them in Good Terms with Heaven. A very Grand Mi&s;take! You read; Matth. III. 10. <HI>E|very Tree that brings not forth Good Fruit, is hewn down, and ca&s;t into the Fire.</HI> Tis not enough, that you <HI>bring not forth Evil Fruit;</HI> You mu&s;t <HI>bring forth Good Fruit;</HI> and by a Regenera|ting Work of God upon you, be made <HI>Good Trees</HI> in order to it; You mu&s;t not only be <HI>Witholden</HI> from <HI>Sin,</HI> but al&s;o be <HI>Converted</HI> from <HI>Sin;</HI> el&s;e you go into a <HI>Fire</HI> to be trembled at! Not only <HI>Sins of Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion,</HI> will expo&s;e you to it.</P>
<P>III. Certainly, it becomes us to do what we can, that <HI>Others</HI> as well as <HI>Our &s;elves,</HI> may be <HI>Witheld</HI> from <HI>Sinning</HI> a|gain&s;t the Glorious God. This is very plain; If the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God be great, in <HI>Witholding men from Sinning</HI> again&s;t Him, Then they who Seduce or Invite others to Sin, are the wor&s;t <HI>Enemies</HI> they can have in the world. Yea, 'tis a <HI>Mercy</HI> to be <HI>Delivered from &s;uch Unrea&s;onable men;</HI> to be kept out of the <HI>Paths</HI> of &s;uch <HI>De|&s;troyers!</HI> I will fir&s;t &s;ay this; <HI>My Son,

There are two or three things to be ob&s;erved in the words. 1. The hainous Guilt of Murder. 2. That Deliverance from it is to be earne&s;tly &s;ought of God. 3. That God mu&s;t have the Glory of &s;uch Pre&s;ervation and Deliverance.</P>
<P>I. <HI>That Murder is a Sin of a very hai|nous and heavy guilt.</HI> So the <HI>Text</HI> &s;peaks of it; <HI>Blood-guiltine&s;s,</HI> or the guilt of <HI>Blood.</HI> A deep <HI>Stain,</HI> &amp; a deep <HI>Wound;</HI> whereby the Con&s;cience is ga&s;hed and defiled.</P>
<P>I will only look into the <HI>Law of God,</HI> and ob&s;erve to you how it is forbidden and condemned therein.

words of the <HI>Souls under the Altar; How long Lord, Holy and True?</HI> The Heavens <HI>reveal</HI> this Iniquity, and the Earth ri&s;es up again&s;t it, <HI>Lamech</HI> was one of <HI>Cains</HI> Accur&s;ed Race, and it &s;hould &s;eem of the &s;ame bloody and barbarous Di&s;po&s;ition: Whether he had Murer'd any of the <HI>Holy Seed</HI> or no, yet certainly he owns him&s;elf to be a very fierce and cruel man; and he glories in this his &s;hame, as &s;uch fierce and bloody people u&s;e to do:</Q> with a haughty Impenitence he pre&s;umes on, and challenges the Protection of Pro|vidence.

<P>The&s;e <HI>Texts</HI> need no Comment; they utterly forbid the Concealment or the Protection of a <HI>Murderer</HI> among a people; the <HI>Government</HI> may not Par|don this Sin, nor People interceed for it; It may not be <HI>bought</HI> off by any <HI>Price</HI> or any <HI>Favour,</HI> on the pain of Guilt on the Publick: Gods <HI>Altar</HI> may not &s;helter him, and much le&s;s any Humane Power or Pity.</P>
<P>Let no man think that this looks <HI>Cruel</HI> or <HI>Inhumane:</HI> The Ju&s;tice of God has &s;o fix'd it; Yea, his tender <HI>Mer|cies</HI> to Mankind do account for this His Righteous Law and Judgment.

We &s;hall, &s;o invade and &s;acrifice all Law, both Humane and Divine to our own weakne&s;s.</P>

<P>There were <HI>two</HI> things in the <HI>Law of Mo&s;es,</HI> that were high Expre&s;&s;ions of the Hainous Nature of <HI>Man-&s;laughter</HI> in the Account of God: The <HI>one</HI> was, that

<P>To Conclude, <HI>Natural Con&s;cience</HI> has the highe&s;t re&s;entment and horror a|gain&s;t the Sin of Murder; it is an uni|ver&s;al and irre&s;i&s;tible Principle in the Hearts of all men.
