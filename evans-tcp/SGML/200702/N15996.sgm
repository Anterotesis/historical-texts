<HEAD>A Surpri&s;ing Account &amp;c. OF DISCOVERIES IN THE We&s;tern World.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been a matter of ob&s;ervation, that whatever is out of the common line of hu|man occurrences, though credibly atte&s;ted to, is generally pa&s;&s;ed over very &s;lightly, and treated as empty chim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ras by a re&s;pectable part of mankind.</P>

Probably the truth of this little narra|tive may be doubted, but as the nar|rators are well known by many, and the real|ity of their &s;ufferings evident from the marks on their mutilated bodies, they doubt not that the account of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r extraordinary di&s;coveries will be highly plea&s;ing to the public in gener|al, and pay the expence of printing, &amp;c.</P>

<P>After &s;ix days further very &s;evere travel, we arrived at a large indian town.

We killed the others likewi&s;e without any noi&s;e, and &s;natching up our own knap&s;acks and clothes that lay in one corner of the wigwam, and taking each of us a knife, tomahawk and mu&s;ket, we i&s;&s;ued forth and traveling all night, reached the top of a high mountain&punc; here we tarried near a week, feeding on roots, &amp;c. till our wounds began to heal, and then pur&s;ued our rout along the mountain, fearing to de&s;cend into the vallies, lea&s;t we &s;hou'd fall into the hands of the inhuman &s;avages, which we dreaded wor&s;e than death it&s;elf.

<P>We now determined to make u&s;e of our newly acquired trea&s;ure, to prepare a little food for pro&s;ecuting our journey we&s;tward, as we were not yet freed from our fear of the indians.

<P>We had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;mall rivers on legs, and trunks of trees, &amp;c. which we found blown down and lying near their banks, but after travelling in the low lands about three weeks longer, in our old due we&s;t cour&s;e, we arrived at the bank of a large river or &s;ea. We thought now that all our journeying we&s;tward, was at an end, however after tra|velling along the bank of the river a few days we di&s;covered a large canoe with paddles in it; this circum&s;tance made us fear we were rear &s;ome nation of indians, and as we were afraid of falling into the hands of &s;avages, we determined, to embark, although the wind blow high from the ea&s;t, and accordingly jumping into the canoe, we &s;oon rigged up a &s;ort of a ma&s;t, and committed our&s;elves to the mercy of the winds and waves.</P>
<P>We had when we went on board, about ten days provi&s;ion, which we determined to hu&s;band to the be&s;t advantage as we were uncertain what provi&s;ion we &s;hould find on the we&s;tern &s;hore.</P>
<P>It was about the middle of the afternoon when we embarked, and as we &s;ailed at a great rate we were &s;oon out of &s;ight of land, howe|ver as the wind &s;eemed rather to fall than ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,

<P>After being carried at a &s;urprizing rate for fifteen days, towards evening we perceived the current gradually changed its cour&s;e, and &s;et towards the &s;hore, and that its force abated co&s;iderably. Our provi&s;ions were now ex|hau&s;ted to the la&s;t mor&s;el, but we had &s;ome hopes of relief, as we had worked our boat in|to the ends, were got into a creek, with a plea&s;ant &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re on each &s;ide, on which to our in|ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we &s;oon effected a landing, and fea&s;ted on the &s;pontaneous luxuries of nature, with which the &s;hore abounded.</P>
