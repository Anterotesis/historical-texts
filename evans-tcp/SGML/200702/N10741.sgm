<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR COUNTRYMEN and FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e was delivered on a very &s;olemn occa&s;ion, before an auditory apparently &s;erious and de|vout in their attention; and is now made public at the de&s;ire of &s;ome of my public &s;pirited friends.

And I hope and tru&s;t that your candor will be &s;uch, amid&s;t all the inaccuracies and imperfections that attend &s;uch an ha&s;ty compo&s;ition, as to accept it for a real token and proof of my undi&s;&s;embled love and heart-felt concern for my dear country, under the dark and threatning a&s;pects of divine providence on our mo&s;t invaluable liberties and privileges. While I ob&s;erve with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible grief, and anxious concern, &s;ome of my countrymen, &s;unk into a &s;tate of wor&s;e than brutal &s;tupidity and in&s;en&s;ibility, who &s;ecretly rejoice in the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing mi&s;eries and calamities brought on our &s;uf|fering brethren at <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> and ardently wi&s;h and pray, <HI>in the mo&s;t profane manner,</HI> if I may be allowed the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, that our charter and birth right privileges may be taken from us; that we may be ruled by the iron rod of op|pre&s;&s;ion, and chained down to eternal &s;lavery and bondage.

Who&s;e factious and rebellious leaders improve every oppor|tunity in their power, to impeach a loyal people; and to &s;end mi&s;repre&s;entations of us to their corre&s;pondents that have ac|ce&s;s to the Briti&s;h court, to ha&s;ten our intended ruin and de|&s;truction. I &s;ay, while the&s;e clande&s;tine, mi&s;chievous opera|tions are carrying on again&s;t us, as black and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the powder-trea&s;on plot; it revives my &s;oul, and rejoices my heart to find that the main body of the people, or at lea&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and judicious part of them, are in &s;ome de|gree, awakened by the loud thunders in Providence, and have their eyes opened to the danger and ruin we are threatened with; that they are &s;o far rai&s;ed above that infam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s herd of vile mi&s;creants, as to know that they are men, and have the &s;pirits of men; and not an inferior &s;pecies of animals, made to be bea&s;ts of burden to a lawle&s;s, corrupt admini&s;tra|tion. This manly, this heroic, and truly patriotic &s;pirit, which is gradually kindling up in every free-man's brea&s;t, through the continent, is undoubtedly a token for good; and will, if duly regulated by Chri&s;tian principles and rules, en|&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to American liberty and freedom. No free &s;tate was ever yet en&s;laved and brought into bondage, where the people were ince&s;&s;antly vigilant and watchful; and in&s;tantly took the alarm at the fir&s;t addition made to the power ex|erci&s;ed over them.&mdash;They are tho&s;e only of the tribes of <HI>I&s;|&s;achar,</HI> who keep in profound &s;leep; and like &s;trong and &s;tu|pid <HI>a&s;&s;es,</HI> couch down between heavy burdens; that in&s;en&s;i|bly &s;ink into abject &s;lavery and bondage. It is a duty in|cumbent upon us at all times, to keep a watchful attention to our intere&s;ts; (e&s;pecially in &s;ea&s;ons of peril and danger,) to watch and pray that we fall not.</P>
<P>I do not mean to encourage evil jealou&s;ies and groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions of our civil rulers, the guardians of our liberties; nor to countenance &s;editious tumults in the &s;tate, &s;o de&s;truc|tive to our civil happine&s;s and peace. I am a firm friend to good order and regularity; that all ranks of men move in &s;trait lines, and within their own proper &s;pheres: That au|thority and government be &s;upported and maintained &s;o as

<P>But you, <HI>Gentlemen Freemen,</HI> have been &s;o well in|doctrinated in the principles of loyalty and good policy, have been &s;o con&s;tantly taught from your infancy, to fear God, and honor the King, that 'tis needle&s;s to add any particular in&s;tructions on this head. However, as my heart, at this threatning period, is &s;o full of apprehen&s;ion of danger, you will not, I tru&s;t, take it as any reflection on your under|&s;tanding and integrity as a body, &s;hould I drop the hint, that there may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome <HI>here</HI> and <HI>there</HI> in di&s;gui&s;e, a|gain&s;t who&s;e plau&s;ible pretences, and artful in&s;inuations, it might be well for you to guard. <HI>Men,</HI> (&s;ays the truly in|genious and patriotic Farmer, in Penn&s;ylvania,) <HI>who either hold or expect to hold certain advantages by &s;etting ex|amples of &s;ervility to their countrymen; men, who trained to the employment, or &s;elf-taught by a natu|ral ver&s;ality of genius; &s;erve as decoys, for drawing the innocent and unwary, into &s;nares; it is not to be doubted but that &s;uch men will diligently be&s;tir them|&s;elves on this, and every like occa&s;ion, to &s;pread the infection of their meanne&s;s as far as they can. On the plans they have adopted, this is their cour&s;e; this is their method to recommend them&s;elves to their patron: they act con&s;i&s;tently in a bad cau&s;e.&mdash;From them we &s;hall learn how plea&s;ant and profitable a thing it is, to be, for our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive behaviour, well-&s;poken of at St.</HI> James<HI>'s, or St.</HI> Stephen<HI>'s, at</HI> Guild-hall, <HI>or the</HI> Royal-exchange. <HI>Specious fallacies will then be dre&s;t up with all the arts of delu&s;ion, to per&s;uade one co|lony to di&s;tingui&s;h her&s;elf from another by unbecom|ing conde&s;centions, which will &s;erve the ambitious purpo&s;es of great men at home; the way to obtain con&s;iderable rewards.&mdash;It will be in&s;inuated to us with

<P>Some of a narrow contracted turn of mind may think that by this quotation, and &s;ome other expre&s;&s;ions I have u&s;ed, I aim to point out per&s;ons of a certain religious profe&s;&s;i|on, as objects of public odium and contempt. To which I an&s;wer, no further than their temper and conduct render them worthy of it. I do not think that piety, public virtue, and a love to one's country, are entailed to, or in&s;eperably connected with any one mode of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity; how|ever &s;ome may have the advantage of others, in their tenden|cy to promote the&s;e chri&s;tian and political virtues; yet I believe there may be mean, ba&s;e and mercenary wretches in every profe&s;&s;ion, who for one &s;weet delicious mor&s;el to them|&s;elves, might be tempted to &s;ell their country with all its liberties and privileges, as profane <HI>E&s;au</HI> &s;old his birth-right. On the other hand, I believe there are many good men, of &s;ound integrity, of unblemi&s;hed morals, and truly lovers of their country in every denomination of chri&s;tians. On this &s;ubject, it matters not with me, whether a man be

a &s;tated member of <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> church, whether he be in com|munion with that e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Old</HI> England, or in <HI>New;</HI> provided he be a good man, actuated by evangelical prin|ciples and motives, and will &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty where|with Chri&s;t has made him free.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD the &s;overeign Lord and &s;upreme Ruler of all things, has made men in &s;uch a manner, and placed them in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as plainly to di&s;cover his will, that they &s;hould unite and combine into &s;ocieties for their mutual benefit and advantage. He has not, by the light of nature, nor by any po&s;itive declarations of his will, infallibly di|rected what form of &s;ociety he would have to prevail, nor pre&s;cribed any one particular &s;pecies of civil go|vernment, as more agreeable to him, than another. But has made mankind rational creatures; and left them to choo&s;e that which they apprehend to be mo&s;t perfect in its nature and kind, and be&s;t &s;uited to their &s;tate, &s;ituation and circum&s;tances. The divine con|&s;titution, and government of God over his intelligent creatures, is fixed; and it does not become men to exerci&s;e their invention or wi&s;dom in &s;eeking any alte|ration or change in it: but to &s;tudy the mo&s;t ready and cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; as they may be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever God requires, is fit and right for his &s;ubjects to comply with. His authority and power over us is unlimited and uncontrolable, and cannot be denied, or oppo&s;ed without our being guilty of the highe&s;t crime of rebellion. But no created being is inve&s;ted with &s;uch ab&s;olute, unlimited power, nor qualified for the exer|ci&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="013614_0010_0F905B46574E0C98">
of it. Error and imperfection belongs to every individual of the human race. The brighte&s;t charac|ter that was ever ju&s;tly drawn among mortal men, has this dark &s;hade in it: So that the will of none, is in|fallibly right in all things, and cannot therefore be com|plied with in all in&s;tances, con&s;i&s;tent with a good con&s;cience, and the &s;uperior obligations we are under to the &s;overeign Ruler of the world; who &s;till main|tains his rightful authority over us, and has not given it by delegation, to any one among created beings: all of whom were originally made free-agents; and con&s;idered as in a &s;tate of nature, previous to their uniting as members of &s;ociety, have their liberty and free choice to agree upon &s;uch a form of government, and mode of admini&s;tration in their civil and tempo|ral affairs, as they judge mo&s;t conducive to their hap|pine&s;s and good: any one of which has no more claim than another to be, <HI>jure divino,</HI> or of divine right, on any other principle, than its being more conformable to right rea&s;on and equity, by the eternal rules of which, God has manife&s;ted it to be his will, that his rational creatures be governed.</P>
<P>As &s;ocieties and communities have their beginning and origin in voluntary compact and agreement; when per&s;ons have entered by con&s;ent and free choice, into &s;ociety, they mu&s;t acknowledge them&s;elves under &s;trict and &s;acred obligations to act toward one another a|greeable to the laws and con&s;titution of that &s;ociety whereof they are members. There are certain duties required of rulers, as well as of &s;ubjects; and their obligations faithfully and punctually to fulfil them, ri&s;e in proportion to the dignity and importance of their high and elevated &s;tations; and the effect and in|fluence which their conduct has on the re&s;t of the body. A man's being rai&s;ed to honour and promo|tion above others, is &s;o far from relea&s;ing him from, or le&s;&s;ening his duty, that every &s;tep he takes in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s advancement, proportionably enlarges it, and adds a
<PB N="13" REF="013614_0011_0F905B47125E50F8">
new and powerful obligation to the performance of it. The mo&s;t ab&s;olute of &s;overeign princes owe &s;omething to the meane&s;t of their &s;ubjects; and may be very criminal in the neglect or refu&s;al of it. Subjects have rights, privileges and properties; and are countenanc|ed and &s;upported by the law of nature, the laws of &s;ociety, and the law of God; in demanding full pro|tection in the enjoyment of the&s;e rights, and the im|partial di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, from their rulers. And when rulers refu&s;e the&s;e, and will not comply with &s;uch a rea&s;onable and equitable demand from the &s;ubject; the &s;ociety is di&s;&s;olved; and its fundamental laws violated and broken; and the relation between the ruler and the &s;ubject cea&s;es, with all the duties and obligations that aro&s;e from it. For it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;|ed, and every one of common &s;en&s;e will readily allow, that no man would ever have con&s;ented to place him|&s;elf in the &s;tate of a &s;ubject, on any other con&s;iderati|on or footing than that of his having protection and ju&s;tice from tho&s;e to whom he &s;ubmitted. The good of &s;ociety in all its individual members, is the end for which it is formed; and for which government is in|&s;tituted and appointed. And this cannot be obtained, unle&s;s rulers exert their power, influence and authori|ty to protect their &s;ubjects in all their valuable rights and privileges; defend them again&s;t their enemies, both from without, and within; and admini&s;ter im|partial ju&s;tice among them. <HI>David,</HI> who had, for many years, exerci&s;ed an ab&s;olute &s;overeignty and do|minion over the kingdom of I&s;rael, had no notion of aggrandizing him&s;elf, and his nobility, by en&s;laving his &s;ubjects, and &s;triping them of their property, at his own arbitrary will and plea&s;ure, contrary to <HI>law</HI> and <HI>right</HI>: but con&s;iders him&s;elf as appointed to &s;erve them, who&s;e rights and privileges were e&s;teemed by him, more &s;acred and inviolable than tho&s;e of the roy|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l &s;cepter and diadem.

him&s;elf the faithful &s;ervant of God, and his generation. His ambition and de&s;ire was to &s;erve his generation; not to be &s;erved by them in the character of abject va&s;&s;als and &s;laves. A king or prince of his noble and heroic &s;pirit could have no plea&s;ure or &s;a|tisfaction in ruling over their fellow-mortals, degrad|ed to &s;uch a low, infamous &s;tate, &s;o far beneath hu|manity. But to rule over men that have the &s;pirit of men, the &s;pirit of loyalty and liberty; and who po&s;|&s;e&s;s &s;ome property too; is an honour to the mo&s;t dig|nified king or prince. And the more of this &s;pirit of liberty, in conjunction with property among the &s;ub|jects, the greater is the honour of him that &s;ways the &s;cepter in righteou&s;ne&s;s over them. This Jewi&s;h, or I&s;raeliti&s;h prince was very &s;en&s;ible, that kings and rulers were liable to do wrong, unju&s;t actions, as well as others; that the &s;ubjects had rights and properties that might be invaded or encroached upon by them. We therefore find among his la&s;t words, the excellent &s;en|tence now read, which he &s;pake ju&s;t as he was leaving his earthly throne and kingdom, and going to appear before a higher tribunal.&mdash;<HI>He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God.

<P>In further di&s;cour&s;ing from the&s;e words, I &s;hall,</P>
<P N="1">I. Con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity and importance of ju&s;tice in civil rulers.</P>
<P N="2">II. Shew that the fear of the Lord is the proper, effectual principle, to influence &s;uch to the ob&s;ervation and practice of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="1">I. 'Tis highly nece&s;&s;ary and important, that civil rulers &s;hould be ju&s;t. Such are concerned in the rules of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, as well as other men; and indeed, more &s;o, in proportion as they are rai&s;ed above others; and have it in their power to do greater good or evil, according as they are inclined. Was the doc|trine true, <HI>That all property is ve&s;ted in the king, or chief rulers; and that they can do no wrong to their &s;ub|jects:</HI> Such &s;cripture precepts and directions from the &s;overeign Ruler of the world as that in my text, would be entirely needle&s;s and impertinent; and &s;eem, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, to argue his want of wi&s;dom and knowledge, on this important &s;ubject. But however bold &s;ome conceited, ambitious mortals may be, in cen&s;uring others, when advanced a little above them in wealth and power; yet, I would hope that few or none will dare openly to attack divine revelation, and cen&s;ure the ruling wi&s;dom of God. <HI>Let God be true, tho' every man be found a liar. Let God be wi&s;e, tho' every man be found a fool.</HI> If tho&s;e that rule over men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t; there is certainly &s;ome rule of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s for them to ob&s;erve in this office and character: and it may be infered by ju&s;t con&s;equence,
<PB N="16" REF="013614_0014_0F905B4C356D4AB8">
<HI>That they are capable of doing wrong</HI>; and as liable &s;o to do as other men,&mdash;That tho&s;e who &s;tand related to them as &s;ubjects, have really &s;omething to call their own,&mdash;that they have rights and properties di&s;tinct from their &s;overeign,&mdash;are capable of &s;uffering inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion and wrong, even from them; and that, in a greater degree than from any of their fellow-&s;ubjects, in proportion to the greater degree of their &s;trength and power. The afore&s;aid doctrine therefore, advanc|ed by &s;ome, <HI>That kings and &s;overeign rulers with their mini&s;try, can do no wrong,</HI> is &s;o far from being true, that it is the mo&s;t fal&s;e, ab&s;urd doctrine that was ever preached in the world; and of mo&s;t pernicious bad con&s;equence both to ruler and ruled, directly tending not only to the temporal, but eternal de&s;truction of both. As rulers are capable, when they rightly improve the &s;uperiour advantages of their high and elevated &s;tati|ons, of doing more towards promoting ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s among their fellow-men: &s;o, when of a contrary temper and di&s;po&s;ition, that it to &s;ay, when they neglect, and refu&s;e to attend to tho&s;e good laws and rules of equity; and take it into their heads to act in an arbitrary, tyrannical manner, to oppre&s;s and en|&s;lave their &s;ubjects; they do the highe&s;t inju&s;tice and wrong, and the greatest mi&s;chief and evil of any men in the world; and are the bigge&s;t plagues, and heavie&s;t judgments upon a &s;ociety that can be &s;ent upon them.</P>
<Q>Corruptio optimi e&s;t pe&s;&s;ima.</Q>
<P>None therefore that are promoted to the office and character of civil rulers, ought to think them&s;elves above the ob&s;ervation of the eternal rules of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, by which they them&s;elves, as well as their &s;ubjects, will be tried hereafter, and ju&s;tified or condemned by the righteous judge of the world.</P>
<P>BUT that I may, to better advantage, illu&s;trate the great nece&s;&s;ity and importance of ju&s;tice in civil rulers, I &s;hall briefly con&s;ider them in their &s;everal capacities, and &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of their being ju&s;t, while acting in them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="013614_0015_0F905B4D986E2680">Now, under the name of rulers, are comprehended; both tho&s;e who enact laws, and tho&s;e who execute them; tho&s;e who are cloathed with legi&s;lative autho|rity, and tho&s;e who have that which is judicial and mi|ni&s;terial.</P>
<P>WHEN men fir&s;t joined in &s;ociety, 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for them to form at once, a complete, perfect &s;y&s;tem of laws, to &s;uit all exigences, and particular ca&s;es that might happen: they could not fore&s;ee all future events, and make provi&s;ion for them. The body politic, is like the natural body; &s;ubject to a variety of di&s;tem|pers and di&s;ea&s;es,&mdash;'tis &s;ometimes &s;trong, healthy and vigorous, and every part performs its proper office and function, without impediment or ob&s;truction:&mdash;At o|ther times, it declines, grows weak and relaxed in all its nervous parts; and to u&s;e the &s;ignificant and beau|tiful language of in&s;piration, <HI>The whole head is &s;ick, and the whole heart faint; from the &s;ole of the foot, even unto the head, there is no &s;oundne&s;s in it.</HI> And as it is liable to be thus &s;ickly and di&s;tempered; &s;o 'tis liable to be di&s;&s;olved and die.</P>

it is nece&s;&s;ary for the well-being of &s;ociety, that good laws be made; &s;o 'tis likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary that they be duly put in execution; and that, both in civil and criminal ca&s;es: this being the life of the law, without which it &s;ignifies nothing toward an&s;wering the end for which it was made. Now, in order to this, &s;ome per|&s;ons mu&s;t have authority to judge between a man and his neighbour, and to put their judgments in execution.</P>
<P>THUS rulers con&s;idered either in their legi&s;lative or executive capacity, are de&s;igned for the general and public good of the community they &s;erve; they are the mini&s;ters of God, in&s;tituted and ordained to at|tend continually unto this very thing; and in both the&s;e capacities, they mu&s;t be ju&s;t. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. There is ju&s;tice to be ob&s;erved in making laws. The legi&s;lative authority is u&s;ually &s;tiled &s;upreme. The power of making laws is undoubtedly the highe&s;t in every &s;ociety. The executive officers are obliged to ob&s;erve the rule pre&s;cribed them by the legi&s;lators; and all the &s;ubjects of every order, to yield obedience to their laws; provided they are not prejudicial to, but &s;alutary and for the good of &s;ociety; and do not in|terfere with the duty they owe to the great Sovereign of all men; and do not contradict the end for which men unite, as members of &s;ociety; nor run counter to the fundamental con&s;titution on which they are &s;ettled. While a &s;ociety &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, no man, or number of men, have authority to call to account tho&s;e who are ve&s;ted with &s;upreme authority: which makes it ex|tremely difficult to correct di&s;orders in a &s;tate, when the foundations are out of cour&s;e. But tho' &s;overeign rulers cannot, while they continue in their high office and character, be called to account, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any under them; yet 'tis po&s;&s;ible for them, by acting contrary to the de&s;ign and intention of their office, to di&s;&s;olve the &s;ociety over which they rule; and &s;o, at once lo&s;e all their &s;overeign power and authority: after which, they can have no more than other men, to &s;creen them from
<PB N="19" REF="013614_0017_0F905B4E985ADD00" MS="y">
&s;uch puni&s;hment as their crimes de&s;erve. And when &s;uch a melancholy event takes place, that a civil &s;oci|ety is di&s;&s;olved, and men return to a &s;tate of nature; They have the &s;ame liberty they at fir&s;t had, to form them&s;elves into &s;ociety again, in what form, and on what terms they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the &s;overeignty of legi&s;lators, they are under &s;trict and &s;acred obligations to ob&s;erve the rule of ju&s;tice, in enacting laws. 'Tis a great and very dangerous mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e, that legi&s;lators have a power ab&s;olutely arbitrary; or that their authority is under no limitation or re&s;traint at all. Right and wrong, are founded in the nature of things; and cannot be altered and changed, even by the voice of &s;uch kings and monarchs as are betru&s;ted with the power of mak|ing laws. The P&s;almi&s;t mentions, <HI>A throne of ini|quity which frameth mi&s;chief by a law.</HI> And if he had not mentioned &s;uch a thing, any per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding, who con&s;idered things with the lea&s;t degree of attention, would &s;oon be convinc|ed, that 'twas in the nature of things, po&s;&s;ible to e&s;|tabli&s;h iniquity by a law. And any one who is ac|quainted with the hi&s;tory of former ages; or even with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world, cannot but know, that this has in fact, been often done. No intelligent friends to the chri&s;tian in&s;titution doubts, but the laws made by the heathen emperors for extirpating chri&s;tianity, and de&s;troying the profe&s;&s;ors of it, were unju&s;t. All &s;ound prote&s;tants, I &s;uppo&s;e, will agree in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;ame &s;entence on the laws which e&s;ta|bli&s;h an <HI>inqui&s;ition</HI> in &s;ome popi&s;h countries. And it mu&s;t be a plea&s;ure to all lovers of liberty and virtue, to ob&s;erve, that the number of tho&s;e who wi&s;h that no penal laws might be enacted in matters merely religi|ous,&mdash;that no per&s;on might be liable to any penalty, or lie under any incapacity, on account of any opini|on or practice in religion, which does not at all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffect the peace and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety, is daily in|crea&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="013614_0018_0F905B4F583E8B00">NOW, if there be any &s;uch thing as acting unju&s;tly in making a law, 'tis plain that rulers, con&s;idered in their legi&s;lative capacity, are obliged to ob&s;erve &s;ome rule of ju&s;tice. For where there is no duty or obligati|on of this &s;ort, there can be no &s;uch thing as acting unju&s;tly.</P>
<P>'TIS a part of ju&s;tice in legi&s;lators to enact &s;uch laws as are &s;uited to the circum&s;tances of the &s;ociety for the regulation of which they are intended: &s;uch as con|duce to the public good:&mdash;And &s;uch as, in&s;tead of de&s;troying, will &s;ecure and protect the ju&s;t rights and privileges of every individual member:&mdash;&s;uch as will, in an equitable manner, decide controver&s;ies between particular &s;ubjects; and defend the weak, and pre|vent their becoming an ea&s;y prey to the &s;trong:&mdash;&s;uch finally, as may be a terror to evil doers, and an en|couragement to tho&s;e that do well.</P>
<P>THERE is further, ju&s;tice to be ob&s;erved between the community and particular per&s;ons; under which head, are to be reckoned the granting proper rewards to tho&s;e who faithfully &s;erve the public in any capa|city: paying public debts: and &s;acredly ob&s;erving the public faith. Here likewi&s;e may be mentioned the penalties annexed to laws. Penal laws are intended for the public good: The great intention of puni&s;h|ing the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of them is, that others may be kept in awe. And legi&s;lators have a right to annex &s;uch penalties to their ju&s;t and equitable laws, as are &s;ufficient to maintain their authority, and &s;ecure the ob&s;ervation of them. But yet, there is ju&s;tice to be ob&s;erved in proportioning puni&s;hments to crimes: and no doubt, it would be unju&s;t, cruel and barbarous, to affix the mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;hments that could be in|vented, to &s;mall and trifling offences.</P>
<P N="2">2. RULERS con&s;idered in their executive capacity, as putting laws in execution, mu&s;t be ju&s;t. Execu|tive officers are obliged to proceed according to the received and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of their country. By
<PB N="21" REF="013614_0019_0F905B5027EB8F08">
the&s;e, they are to judge and determine all controver|&s;ies, both of a civil and criminal natue, which come before them; doing &s;trict, impartial ju&s;tice to all men, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons. Their duty is not to op|pre&s;s: but to deliver the poor that cry to them; the fatherle&s;s, and him that hath none to help. They ought to endeavour that the ble&s;&s;ing, not the cur&s;e of him that is ready to peri&s;h, may come upon them: and to cau&s;e the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy. It concerns them to put on righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to clothe them&s;elves with judgment, as with a robe and diadem. They mu&s;t be eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, and fathers to the poor; and the cau&s;e which they know not, ought to be &s;earched out. To them it be|longs to break the jaws of the wicked; and to pluck the &s;poil out of his teeth; to curb and re&s;train the violent; and let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free. But it being &s;o evident, and univer&s;ally acknowledged, that tho&s;e who put the laws in execution, ought to be ju&s;t men, I &s;hall not enlarge upon this head: but proceed briefly to &s;how the nece&s;&s;ity and importance of rulers being ju&s;t; or to mention &s;ome of the obligations they are under to this great duty. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS is nece&s;&s;ary to their an&s;wering the de&s;ign of their office, and promoting the welfare and good of human &s;ociety. Public good is the end of government of every &s;ort. 'Tis with a view of promoting and &s;ecuring this, that men enter into &s;ociety. 'Tis for obtaining this, that &s;ome are appointed to rule over others; and that tho&s;e &s;ubmit to, and obey them. Now, this important end cannot be obtained, unle&s;s rulers act uprightly and ju&s;tly. When civil rulers, forgeting the end of their in&s;titution, and the proper duties of their &s;tation, neglect and trample upon the rules of ju&s;tice; and con&s;ult only to gratify their own pride and ambitious humour and pa&s;&s;ion: when they con&s;ider their &s;ubjects as an inferior &s;pecies of beings, made as bea&s;ts of burden, for their plea&s;ure or profit;
<PB N="22" REF="013614_0020_0F905B50D5E13240">
when, in&s;tead of ob&s;erving the rea&s;on and nature of things, they make their own mere will and plea&s;ure, the rule of acting; and govern in an arbitrary, tyran|nical manner; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the evils and mi&s;chiefs they bring on mankind. The&s;e have been &s;o great and terrible, that &s;ome have been ready to que&s;tion, Whether civil rulers have not done more hurt than good, in the world. When we &s;ee an haugh|ty and ambitious monarch, or corrupt Mini&s;try &s;pend|ing the blood and trea&s;ure of their &s;ubjects, in carrying on an unrighteous quarrel and contention with them, or again&s;t their neighbours; from a mi&s;taken notion of glory; di&s;tre&s;&s;ing their towns and cities with their troops and armaments, depopulating their country, and &s;eeming to aim at the univer&s;al de&s;truction of man|kind; we may well be &s;hock'd at the &s;ight, and look on &s;uch a lawle&s;s, arbitrary ruler, as the heavie&s;t ca|lamity and judgment, that a righteous God can &s;end upon a &s;inful people. But notwith&s;tanding the dark and di&s;mal pro&s;pect which a &s;cene of tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion affords; 'tis undoubtedly true, that civil go|vernment is de&s;igned for the good of men; and when admini&s;tered with ju&s;tice and mercy, it does excellent|ly well an&s;wer this de&s;ign. As tyrants are the greate&s;t of temporal judgments, as being the cau&s;e of all the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing evils that can be imagined; &s;o good rulers are the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings to the world, and the in&s;truments in God's hand, of &s;ecuring all our other good things. But then, to render them &s;uch, they mu&s;t be ju&s;t, con&s;idered both in a legi&s;lative and execu|tive capacity.</P>
<P N="2">2. RULERS are obliged to be ju&s;t, on account of the great tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. Sovereign authority is the greate&s;t tru&s;t that can be repo&s;ed in any man. The power of making laws is very great, and exten&s;ive in its nature, and of the utmo&s;t importance in the exerci&s;e of it. And next to this, is that of putting laws in execution. The man that is appointed to
<PB N="23" REF="013614_0021_0F905B519A745E90">
judge another, with authority to decide all controver|&s;ies among his fellow-&s;ubjects: to determine and pa&s;s &s;entence upon the lives and properties of &s;uch va&s;t numbers of men; has a very great and important tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. And the weight and importance of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in any inferiour executive officer, is proportioned to the authority ve&s;ted in him. Now, the receiving &s;uch a tru&s;t lays a man under very great obligations to faithfulne&s;s in the di&s;charge of it. Men in &s;uch high places of tru&s;t and authority, in&s;tead of being relea&s;ed from the laws of God, and having their obligations to faithfulne&s;s in the di&s;charge of duty, le&s;&s;en|ed and dimini&s;hed; have them increa&s;ed, in proportion to their advancement; and it is not beneath the dignity of their &s;tations, to attend very &s;eriou&s;ly to the advice and exhortation of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Be wi&s;e now therefore, O ye kings; be in&s;tructed ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear; ki&s;s the &s;on, lest he be angry, and ye peri&s;h from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.</HI> 'Tis of importance, if men have but one talent, that they improve it: but if they have ten, and neglect and refu&s;e &s;o to do; the puni&s;hment will be tenfold greater. If a private man neglects his duty, he, and others connected with him, may &s;uffer. But if a chief ruler is unju&s;t and unfaithful, the whole community or body politic &s;uffers. As much therefore as the welfare and happine&s;s of &s;uch a community, or body, is to be va|lued above, and preferred to the happine&s;s of an in|dividual; &s;o much higher and greater are his obliga|tions to faithfulne&s;s, than the obligations of a private member of &s;ociety; and if he refu&s;es to di&s;charge them uprightly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly, as in the fear of God; a proportionably heavy and aggravated puni&s;h|ment mu&s;t he expect to receive, when judged by him.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice is nece&s;&s;ary in civil rulers, to their own pre&s;ent comfort, and future happine&s;s. 'Tis a common ob&s;ervation, that the greate&s;t tyrants are the greate&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;laves. Tho&s;e ru|lers
<PB N="24" REF="013614_0022_0F905B52569474E0">
who invade the rights and liberties of their own &s;ubjects, in an arbitrary, tyrannical manner, and &s;eek to oppre&s;s and en&s;lave them; are always in fear of be|ing them&s;elves de&s;troyed by them. They are obliged, at va&s;t expence, to keep up large armies to di&s;tre&s;s and en&s;lave their peaceable &s;ubjects; who, under &s;uch a grievous yoke of bondage, cannot be ea&s;y and &s;atisfi|ed; but will be naturally &s;truggling after liberty; and be ready, when it galls their necks, to turn again&s;t and depo&s;e &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ing tyrants; and &s;ometimes, to imbrue their hands in their blood: of which, many in&s;tances are to be found in the hi&s;tories of the Roman, and of the Turki&s;h empire. Whereas, when princes rule in a ju&s;t and con&s;titutional way, with mildne&s;s and be|nignity; and &s;eek the good and welfare of their &s;ub|jects; they may always put full, unre&s;erved confidence in them, and depend on being &s;upported and defended by them, at the expence of all that is dear and valua|ble to them; yea, at the expence of their lives, which will not be thought too dear a &s;acrifice for the &s;afety and honour of &s;uch a worthy prince.</P>
<P>AGAIN. This ju&s;tice and faithfulne&s;s in rulers is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to their having peace in their own minds and con&s;ciences. Such have con&s;ciences as well as other men, accu&s;ing or el&s;e excu&s;ing; who, upon the faithful di&s;charge of the high tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, will have in|ward peace, &s;ecurity and joy, and heart-felt &s;atisfaction, &s;uch as the world can neither give, nor take away. But on the other hand; if the rules of ju&s;tice and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s be neglected and trampled upon by them, and they practi&s;e high handed tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion: and &s;eek to en&s;lave and de&s;troy their &s;ubjects; what dread|ful horrors of con&s;cience mu&s;t they nece&s;&s;arily feel, when awakened to any &s;erious reflections on their wick|ed, guilty conduct, which has been &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and ruinous to thou&s;ands more innocent and righteous than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>LASTLY. This ju&s;tice and faithfulne&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="25" REF="013614_0023_0F905B550C24B038">
to their future happine&s;s. Tho' civil rulers are &s;tiled <HI>gods,</HI> yet mu&s;t they die like men; and at la&s;t, give an account of them&s;elves to the judge of the quick, and the dead.</P>
<P>I NOW proceed to the next thing propo&s;ed, which was in the &s;econd place, to &s;hew, That the fear of the Lord is the proper, effectual principle to influence ci|vil rulers to the exact ob&s;ervance of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>HE that ruleth over men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t: And that he may be &s;o, he mu&s;t rule in the fear of the Lord. If we con&s;ider human nature, as vitiated by the apo&s;tacy; we &s;hall find, that hardly any thing but the fear of puni&s;hment, is able to keep men in awe, and due &s;ub|jection. That it is thus with &s;ubjects, is evident from the many &s;evere laws, and terrible executions of them, which the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t merciful rulers in all nations, have found nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the peace, and pro|mote the happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety. Now, 'tis certain that the e&s;&s;ential principles of human nature are the &s;ame in all men, whatever external relations they &s;u&s;|tain. There is therefore great danger, that rulers will degenerate into tyrants; and of ble&s;&s;ings, become plagues and cur&s;es to mankind; unle&s;s there be &s;ome way to keep them in awe, &s;ome principle to excite their fears, and by that means, keep them within their proper &s;phere, and engage them to the ob&s;ervation of ju&s;tice. Now, this is not always to be done by a fear of men. Sovereigns are exempted from the common power of human laws; there is no ordinary authority that may judge them; and this their &s;ecurity may prove a &s;trong temptation to them, to neglect the proper duties of their exalted &s;tations. They may tru&s;t in their forces and armies to defend them from the re&s;entment of an injured and oppre&s;&s;ed people; and &s;o imagine them|&s;elves perfectly &s;ecure from puni&s;hment at pre&s;ent. And the nearer any &s;ubordinate ruler approaches to &s;overeignty; the le&s;s has he to fear from men, and con&s;equently, the greater pro&s;pect has he, of indemni|fication

in acting unju&s;tly. There is therefore the utmo&s;t need and nece&s;&s;ity, that tho&s;e who rule over men, &s;hould rule in the fear of the Lord; that they &s;hould have a firm belief of the being, perfections and providence of God; that they &s;hould not only fear his vindictive puni&s;hing ju&s;tice, but beyond this, as the text requires, maintain an holy awe and reverence of him upon their minds; and con&s;ider him as that righteous judge to whom they mu&s;t at la&s;t, give an account of the di&s;charge of the great tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; and from whom they &s;hall receive a righteous &s;entence of ab&s;o|lution or condemnation.</P>

<P N="1">1. WHAT we have heard on this &s;ubject, &s;hould &s;erve to excite our thankful acknowledgments to the &s;upreme Ruler of the world for his great favour to us, in the happy con&s;titution of government we have hither|to lived under. The providence of God which rules the world, (tho' it does not neglect the le&s;&s;er affairs of men) e&s;pecially concerns it&s;elf in more important things, which re&s;pect more large &s;ocieties and commu|nities of men.

Our privileges in this re&s;pect, are very great, beyond what any other people enjoy,
<PB N="27" REF="013614_0025_0F905B578A7980D8">
in any part of the earth. The bigger part of the world have had their liberties wre&s;ted out of their hands; been oppre&s;t and en&s;laved by lawle&s;s and cruel tyrants: while we are yet in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of freedom. May God pre&s;erve it to us &s;afe, and hand it down to the late&s;t po&s;terity! Our fathers went through the greate&s;t perils and dangers to procure the&s;e privileges for us; and we ought to be willing to do our utmo&s;t to pre|&s;erve them, and hand them down to our children and offspring. Our trea&s;ure, and our blood too, are not too dear and co&s;tly &s;acrifices for &s;uch valuable things.</P>
<P N="2">2. OF what importance is it, that civil rulers be men of uprightne&s;s and integrity; men of real piety and religion; who fear the Lord, and keep up a pro|per awe and reverence of him upon their minds? This is nece&s;&s;ary to their own comfort and happine&s;s; to the peace of their con&s;ciences; and to their having a well-grounded hope of a future crown of glory in the coming world. It is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to the good and happine&s;s of the &s;ociety, over which they are ap|pointed to rule. If a &s;overeign prince or ruler be de&s;|titute of integrity and ju&s;tice; and has not the fear of the great God before his eyes: all inferior motives which might have influence on men in lower &s;tations, will be in&s;ufficient to re&s;train him from wicked acts of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, and keep him to his duty. As &s;uch cannot well be arraigned before any human tribu|nal on earth, to account for their conduct; if they have no fear and dread on their minds, of appearing before, and accounting to their &s;upreme Judge, the &s;o|vereign ruler of the world; they will be in the utmo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, not only of ruining them&s;elves both for time and eternity; but al&s;o, of ruining their &s;ubjects in all their dear and valuable intere&s;ts; and of involving them in the greate&s;t conceivable di&s;tre&s;&s;es and troubles. It is &s;o far from being true, <HI>That &s;uch can do no wrong</HI>; that on the contrary, the experience of all ages te&s;tifies, that they are capable, when they loo&s;e the principles of

<P N="3">3. WHAT has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, is perfectly agreeable to, and ju&s;tifies the principles on which the Briti&s;h nation acted, as a body, in depo&s;ing king <HI>James</HI> the &s;econd, that tyrannical oppre&s;&s;ive prince, when pur&s;uing mea&s;ures tending to their de&s;truction; and in introducing king <HI>William</HI> of glorious memory, to the throne, to &s;way the &s;cepter in righteou&s;ne&s;s. This grand revolution happened between eighty and ninety years ago. The kings who have reigned over us, &s;ince which period, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, can make out no ju&s;t claim and title to the throne, on any other principles than tho&s;e advanced in this di&s;cour&s;e.

If we embrace the above&s;aid doctrine, <HI>That kings with their Council and Mini&s;try can do no wrong</HI>; but mu&s;t be obeyed in all their edicts and commands; we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, condemn the conduct of the nation in general, in ri&s;ing up again&s;t, and depo&s;ing king <HI>James</HI>; and join with the rebels in the high|lands of Scotland, in their endeavours to overthrow the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of Great Britain; and to bring in one of the de&s;cendents of <HI>James,</HI> as our rightful king; and di&s;own him that now &s;its on the Throne; and look upon the afore&s;aid rebels, as the only loyal people in the kingdom; if the nation had no right to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of that ancient king, when they evident<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> tended to deprive the &s;ubjects of their dear liberties, and their be&s;t rights and properties.

And to get right, we mu&s;t throw up the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of England and the <HI>Hanover</HI> family, that is in pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne; and return back in our alle|giance to the <HI>Stuart</HI> family; and to their popi&s;h plan of government.

A doctrine as un|friendly and injurious to the king, as it is dangerous to the rights and liberties of his &s;ubjects. The crown and dignity of the king can be maintained and defend|ed, only on the&s;e ju&s;t and equitable principles, on which the rights and privileges of the people are &s;e|cured and e&s;tabli&s;hed.

On this &s;ure ground and footing, the wi&s;e and judicious part of the reputable inhabitants of <HI>America,</HI> proceed to con&s;ult the be&s;t mea&s;ures of &s;afety and pre&s;ervation in this critical and alarming &s;ituation of our public affairs. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am &s;en&s;ible that the pre&s;ent controver&s;y between Great Britain and the American colonies &s;tands upon a different foot|ing from that between king <HI>James</HI> and his &s;ubjects, at the revo|lution. <HI>That</HI> was a controver&s;y between the king and his &s;ub|jects: <HI>This</HI> is a di&s;pute between the parliament of Great Britain, and the Colonies. We have no controver&s;y with the king; nor in the lea&s;t, di&s;pute his regal authority over us.&mdash;The king, when at home, pre&s;ides in per&s;on, in the Briti&s;h parliament; but when he goes out of the kingdom (to <HI>Hanover</HI> for in&s;tance) he appoints a regent as his repre&s;entative, to pre&s;ide in his ab&s;ence. In <HI>Ireland,</HI> the king pre&s;ides not in per&s;on; but by his repre&s;entative, the <HI>lord lieutenant.</HI> And in like manner, the king pre&s;ides in the &s;everal colonies, by his repre&s;entatives, the governors, which are authori&s;ed by his charters, or immediate commi&s;&s;ions. We have therefore no controver&s;y with our king, who&s;e authority we cheerfully acknowledge, and mo&s;t loyally obey. But the point di&s;puted is, <HI>Whether his maje&s;ty's legi&s;lative body in Great Britain, has a right to exerci&s;e &s;overeign authority over his maje&s;ty's legi&s;lative A&s;&s;emblies in the Colonies, for taxation, or the regulation of their inter|nal policy.</HI> The kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> owes allegiance to the king of <HI>Great Britain</HI>: but their internal policy is con&s;titutionally re|gulated only by their own parliament. And they have a right to deny the authority of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament to tax them; or to regulate the internal policy of the kingdom. And it is a like ca&s;e with the <HI>American</HI> colonies. We owe allegiance to the king of Great-Britain: but this will not oblige us to yield our&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p to the arbitrary controul of the Briti&s;h parliament.

And therefore the attempts of the Briti&s;h parliament to impo&s;e taxes on the colonies, may be re&s;i&s;ted by the colonies, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with their allegiance to their king. Altho' therefore our pre&s;ent controver&s;y with <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> is on quite another footing than the conte&s;t of the nation in the days of king <HI>James</HI>; yet revolution-principles in their gene|ral nature, will fully ju&s;tify the pre&s;ent con&s;titutional oppo&s;ition of the coloni&s;ts to the arbitrary proceedure of the Briti&s;h court.</NOTE>

To &s;uch, if there are any &s;uch among us, I would recom|mend a &s;erious con&s;ideration of the awful &s;entence God pronounced again&s;t the murmuring I&s;raelites in the wilderne&s;s. Numb. xiv.28. <HI>As truly as I live, &s;aith the Lord, as ye have &s;poken in mine ears, &s;o will I do to you.</HI> I will here cite a pa&s;&s;age from a &s;ermon of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Trumbull,</HI> delivered at the Freeman's-meeting, in the town of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> April 12th, 1773, with his note &s;ubjoined thereto. Speaking of the ad|vantages of free &s;tates, ari&s;ing from their choo&s;ing ru|lers from among them&s;elves, he ob&s;erves concerning rulers thus cho&s;en, "Their government is mild and righteous. And as they do not govern <HI>to get their bread,</HI> and advance their fortunes, at the <HI>ruin</HI> of ours; and as they can lay no burdens on us, with|out bearing the &s;ame weight them&s;elves, their govern|ment is as remarkable for the little expence of it, as it is for its gentlene&s;s, impartiality and righteou&s;|ne&s;s. All our expences, by way of &s;alary to civil officers, do not, I imagine, amount annually, by con|&s;iderable, to the one <HI>half</HI> of the &s;alary of a king's go|vernor,

in any of the neighbouring provinces." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The whole amount of the &s;alaries paid annually by the go|vernment is only &pound;.580. The Salary of the Governor is &pound;.300. of the Deputy Governour &pound;. 100, of the Secretary &pound;. 20, and of the Trea&s;urer &pound;. 160. The Judges of the Superior Court have no &s;alary from the government. The Chief Judge is allowed 18 &s;hillings per day, and the four &s;ide Judges have 17 &s;hillings each per day. This court is obliged by law, to &s;et 14 weeks annually, and commonly &s;etteth, by adjournment, much longer, and the co&s;t of it is about &pound;. 600 per annum. The expence of it for three years and a half pa&s;t, upon a careful examination, appear|eth to be about &pound;. 2100, ju&s;t &pound;. 600 per annum. The avails of it, together with the forfeitures, for the &s;ame term, with proper allowances for &s;uch as may not be recovered, amount to &pound;. 2200 So that the Superior Court is of no co&s;t, at pre&s;ent, to the Colony, con&s;idered as a Government. In &s;hort the whole expence of go|vernment in Connecticut is trifling. The co&s;t of the General A&s;&s;embly annually is about &pound;. 1500. A rate of one penny on the pound, on the Grand Li&s;t, which rai&s;eth about &pound;. 6000 per An|num, near the one half of which is annually taken out of the Trea|&s;ury for Schooling, hath of late years been &s;ufficient to defray all our public charges as a Government." <BIBL><HI>Mr. Trumbull's Di&s;|cour&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Page</HI> 28.</BIBL></NOTE> On the other hand, the pre&s;ent judgment, and threat|ning di&s;cover God's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t us, for indulg|ing pride and vanity, luxury and intemperance. The plain voice of providence is, that God is awfully of|fended with all that practi&s;e the&s;e ruinous and de|&s;tructive vices.</P>
<P>WE are further threatened with being deprived of all our civil privileges, and brought under a mo&s;t cruel, arbitrary and tyrannical kind of government. The &s;cheme of government planned out for <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> is in its whole frame and con&s;titution, completely <HI>de&s;potic</HI> and <HI>arbitrary.</HI> The <HI>will</HI> of the chief ruler is <HI>law</HI>; and the &s;ubject holds his e&s;tate, and even life, only during his plea&s;ure. This arbitrary government will, no doubt, be carried to its greate&s;t extent through all the American colonies, and exerci&s;ed in all its terrors and cruelties upon them, if the pre&s;ent mini&s;try are per|mitted to carry the point they are contending for, in &s;uch a &s;anguine manner.</P>
<P>Now, does not this threatning point out &s;ome par|ticular &s;ins, as procuring it? We have been greatly
<PB N="37" REF="013614_0035_0F905B60B21F0E00">
favoured of God in re&s;pect to the con&s;titution of the government more immediately over us; and the ad|mini&s;tration of our public affairs. We in this colony enjoy, not only the full liberties of Engli&s;hmen; but even &s;ome peculiar privileges, confirmed by royal charter, which di&s;tingui&s;h us from the re&s;t of our fel|low &s;ubjects in the plantations.&mdash;But how far have we been from being truly thankful for &s;uch privileges? And how ready to &s;light and abu&s;e them? How ear|ne&s;tly have &s;ome wi&s;hed them&s;elves in the condition of the poor tenants and &s;laves in a neigbouring province, rather than pay a trifle to &s;upport their liberties, and freedom, and real e&s;tate, in this? How apt have we been to de&s;pi&s;e the per&s;ons, and &s;light the authority of the rulers of our people? To hearken to, and propa|gate reports prejudicial to their character? To counte|nance and join with the di&s;affected, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d begrudge their reward; which is far le&s;s than magi&s;trates in any other province have? And after all the murmuring about it, is very inadequate to the public &s;ervices they perform, and the advantages we derive from their admini&s;tration. There was &s;omething of this di&s;po|&s;ition in the Jews of old: <HI>They refu&s;ed the waters of Shiloah that run &s;oftly</HI>&mdash;they were di&s;contented and un|thankful under a mild government, and gentle admi|ni&s;tration, that allowed them great privileges and li|berties; therefore God threatens to bring upon them <HI>the waters of the river, &s;trong and many,</HI> or to &s;ubject them to the tyrannical government of the king of A&s;&s;yria.</P>
<P>ONCE more. We are awfully threatened with being deprived of the liberty of our con&s;ciences, the liberty of profe&s;&s;ing the important truths of the go&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and attending tho&s;e &s;acred ordinances which God has in|&s;tituted with a view to advance the glory of the Re|deemer, and promote the &s;alvation of his people. This will mo&s;t probably be the con&s;equence of carrying tho&s;e &s;chemes and plans into execution, which the pre&s;ent mini&s;try have projected.&mdash;And does not this
<PB N="38" REF="013614_0036_0F905B61529EF3D8">
loudly declare, That our having neglected the wor&s;hip, and turned our backs upon the ordinances of God; our di&s;tru&s;ting and de&s;pi&s;ing the grace of the go&s;pel, and trifling away the day of &s;alvation; are to be numbered among tho&s;e &s;ins by which we have awfully provoked a righteous God to anger again&s;t us. That omi&s;&s;ions and neglects of this kind, have abounded to an un|u&s;ual, and indeed, to an a&s;toni&s;hing degree, cannot be denied. That &s;uch &s;ins are provoking to God, and that e&s;pecially, in a country which, like this, was origi|nally &s;ettled principally for the purpo&s;es of reforma|tion and religion, cannot rea&s;onably be doubted. And therefore we may ju&s;tly conclude, that God is te&s;tify|ing again&s;t the&s;e kinds of &s;in in particular, and threat|ning us on account of them. Shame and &s;orrow, humiliation and aba&s;ement become us for the&s;e things. We ought, each one, to examine his own heart and life, and enquire what has been done by, or among us, to provoke the Lord to &s;uch an awful controver&s;y; and &s;peedily to return, by go&s;pel-repentance, to his love and &s;ervice; and to the &s;teady con&s;cientious prac|tice of all religious duties he requires of us. Let us be deeply affected with the pre&s;ent critical and alarming &s;ituation of our public affairs; and unite in fervent prayers to that God who is higher than the kings of the earth, that he would graciou&s;ly interpo&s;e for our relief; that he would avert the impending &s;torms of vengeance, and favour us with peace and tranquility, and the full enjoyment of all our valuable liberties and privileges; that our rulers may feed us accord|ing to the integrity of their hearts, and guide us by the &s;kilfulne&s;s of their hands.</P>
<P>And let us be at peace among our&s;elves. It is at all times contrary to the temper and &s;pirit of the go&s;pel; but e&s;pecially un&s;uitable and improper in &s;uch a day as this, to be widening differences, laying unrea&s;onable &s;tre&s;s upon di&s;putable points, and to &s;et on foot controver&s;ies that tend to alienate people's love and affection from each other, and to increa&s;e a party &s;eparating &s;pirit, to

&s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;cord, and foment animo&s;ities. It rather becomes us to fix our attention upon the com|mon cau&s;e, the public good and general intere&s;t of the land. Our &s;trength, our glory, and our &s;ecurity de|pend very much upon our friendly agreement and firm union together. If we get divided and broken to pieces among our&s;elves, what will become of us? What advantage will it give an enemy to our liberties, to bring di&s;tre&s;&s;ing burdens upon us, and lay &s;uch a yoke upon our necks that neither we, nor our po&s;terity can bear. That to which our &s;pecial attention is at this day called, is not a private by-intere&s;t, that concerns the men of one denomination only: but of a general, public nature that concerns men of every per&s;ua&s;ion, that are well-wi&s;hers to their country's welfare. Even tho&s;e who have gone off from the &s;cheme and plan of religion profe&s;&s;ed by the fir&s;t fathers of this country, have great cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s for their liberties and privileges which they enjoy equally with others that &s;till retain it. They have the &s;ame advantages from that happy form of civil government; the &s;ame protection from it, of their per&s;ons and properties; have the &s;ame liberty of con&s;cience, wor&s;hip where they plea&s;e without controul or oppre&s;&s;ion; or if they choo&s;e to &s;tay at home on the Lord's-day, and join with no wor&s;hiping a&s;&s;embly, it is &s;eldom they meet with any interruption or di&s;turbance. What more can they de&s;ire? There does not appear the lea&s;t pro|bability that either they, or we, &s;hould gain any ad|vantage on civil or religious accounts, by giving up our privileges; and &s;ubmitting to a new and different form of government in church and &s;tate; with a great additional burden of taxes which would be unavoida|bly connected with it; under which, who would groan and complain loude&s;t, we cannot tell before trial be made. I hope none of us wi&s;h for &s;uch a fatal experi|ment and proof of a public &s;pirit. We all doubtle&s;s think, whatever be our peculiar &s;entiments in religi|on, that we are &s;ufficiently burdened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;tance of the following Appendix was com|po&s;ed, with a view to enlighten the people of a coun|try town, not under the be&s;t advantages for information from the news papers and other pieces wrote upon the con|trover&s;y, into the true &s;tate of the pre&s;ent unhappy di&s;|putes between Great Britain and the colonies; for this rea|&s;on it &s;till appears in the form of an addre&s;s to the people. It has been thought the publication of it might an&s;wer va|luable purpo&s;es, to rou&s;e others in the we&s;tern part of this colony, who are much in the &s;ame &s;ituation with the people for who&s;e information it was fir&s;t compo&s;ed, to a &s;en&s;e of the danger in which their liberties are now involved. The Author is very willing to contribute his mite to the com|mon cau&s;e of liberty; and is very glad of an opportunity to &s;ubjoin the following Addre&s;s as an appendix to a di&s;|cour&s;e &s;o well adapted (as he imagines the foregoing is) to lead people to a &s;en&s;e of the true nature of civil government, and of the ab&s;urdity of many ridiculous whims; which &s;ome among us have the impudence to attempt to maintain in di|rect oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e principles, which have &s;eated the pre&s;ent Royal Family on the Briti&s;h throne.</P>
<P>Should this appendix fall into the hands of any, that have been more awake to a &s;en&s;e of our danger; than what hath been the ca&s;e in the we&s;tern parts of this colony; the au|thor hopes they will readily overlook the mention of many things, which mu&s;t be trite and common to them; as the particular mention of them was nece&s;&s;ary to the de&s;ign in view.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of others on a &s;ubject of &s;o much importance, and (as many think) &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be wrote upon at the
<PB N="xlvi" REF="013614_0043_0F905B6958B7BA70">
pre&s;ent time, mu&s;t plead in excu&s;e of the Clergy, if they write upon a &s;ubject by &s;ome deemed too political for their province: But let it be remembered that clergymen are free|men as well as others; have civil rights and privileges in common with their fellow &s;ubjects; are capable of feeling oppre&s;&s;ion as well as others: why then is there not an equal obligation on them, as on others, to &s;tand forth in defence of their country, and endeavour to &s;ound the alarm&punc; when they &s;ee every thing that is dear and valuable in the utmo&s;t danger? Were a hou&s;e on fire and the family &s;ecurely &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep|ing while the flames were &s;urrounding them; would it not be the height of folly, for tho&s;e that were by, to &s;tand di&s;|puting who was the propere&s;t per&s;on to give the alarm, and awake them from their dangerous repo&s;e? Much like this is it, to di&s;pute who are the propere&s;t per&s;ons, the clergy or others, to point out to their fellow &s;ubjects the dan|ger their country is in. The pre&s;ent cri&s;is calls for the vigorous exertions of every rank and order of men.</P>
<P>The Author is not in&s;en&s;ible that it is more fa&s;hionable to write <HI>anonimou&s;ly</HI> upon &s;uch &s;ubjects as the&s;e, and would it equally an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed, he would very gladly lie concealed: But he thinks the public are liable to be greatly impo&s;ed upon on the one &s;ide and the other by anonymous publications; as in that ca&s;e no-body is re&s;pon|&s;ible for what is a&s;&s;ert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d.

<P>NEVER was there a period &s;o alarming to the Engli&s;h American colonies as the pre&s;ent is; ne|ver one that called for the careful attention, the pru|dent, yet vigorous exertion of every freeman in the colonies as the pre&s;ent doth! For when our lives, and our property are &s;ubject to the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of others; what have we valuable we can call our own? The di&s;po&s;al of our property is now openly claimed by others; by a body, in which we have no repre&s;entati|on; and upon which we have not the lea&s;t check or controul: and charters, heretofore deemed <HI>&s;a|cred</HI> and inviolable; by which, we have been wont to &s;uppo&s;e, was &s;ecured to us the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our lives and properties, are now wantonly violated with|out even the form of a trial; and &s;uch modes of ju|dicial proceedings introduced into a neighbouring province, as very much &s;ubject the lives of the people to the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of their governor. And doubtle&s;s this is but a &s;pecimen of the plan adopted with regard to all the provinces; which will &s;oon be introduced, if this fir&s;t attempt &s;ucceed. We have to expect, if the mea&s;ures adopted are carried in|to execution, we &s;hall hold both our lives and our pro|perty in coming time upon the mo&s;t precarious tenure. The&s;e mea&s;ures you &s;ee are carrying into execution by the terror of military force both by &s;ea and by land. And if our lives and our property are to be held by &s;uch a precarious tenure as the arbitrary will of tho&s;e, who may be &s;et over us, what is there in life or pro|perty worth the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing? Will not the being in con&s;tant and perpetual fear of the deprivation of both, imbitter all the comforts of life?

<P>Some po&s;&s;ibly may think me extravagant in a&s;&s;ert|ing there never was &s;o alarming a period to the Eng|li&s;h American colonies, as the pre&s;ent is: But I can|not think any one needs any more, than to be thorough|ly acquainted with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of public affairs, to be wholly of my opinion.

And is the death of a number of individuals in war &s;o great a calamity to the public, as a whole country's being en&s;laved, and the lives and the properties not only of the pre&s;ent, but of &s;ucceding generations &s;ubjected to the caprice of arbitrary rulers?</P>

<HI>Then</HI> the nation was awake to the arbitrary mea&s;ures pur&s;uing: <HI>now</HI> they &s;upinely &s;lumber. <HI>Then</HI> Britain felt the weight of the iron hand of tyranny; while <HI>now</HI> they imagine their burdens relieved by the op|pre&s;&s;ion of America.

In the war before the la&s;t, at their own motion, and almo&s;t wholly at their own expence, they took the important fortre&s;s of Loui&s;bourg, which gave peace to Europe. In the la&s;t war 'tis fre&s;h in every one's memory how chearful|ly they complied with every requi&s;ition of men or mo|ney from the Crown: for &s;everal years near a quarter of the militia of New-England were in actual &s;ervice. Yet, with what alacrity performed? Who ever heard a murmur or complaint of our expence of blood and trea&s;ure, tho' Britain reaped the profit of our conque&s;t, as all the conquered lands were theirs? Britain was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the &s;pirited exertions of the Colonies at that time;&mdash;&s;en&s;ible they had contributed more than their proportion, that they refunded to them a con|&s;iderable part of their expence.

All our little earnings therefore went to Britain to purcha&s;e mainly the &s;uperfluities of life. Hence the common people here make a &s;how, much above what they do in England. The luxury and &s;u|perfluities in which even the lower ranks of people here indulge them&s;elves, being reported in England by the officers and &s;oldiers upon their return, excited in the people there a very exalted idea of the riches of this country, and the abilities of the inhabitants to bear taxes. The mini&s;try &s;oon conceived hopes that a large revenue might be rai&s;ed from America.&mdash;A revenue that would be &s;olely at their own di&s;po&s;al, whereby they might provide for great numbers of their depend|ants, and mightily enlarge their influence over the par|liament, to &s;ecure a majority in their mea&s;ures. Ac|cordingly in a few years after the conclu&s;ion of the late war; the Briti&s;h parliament, for the fir&s;t time, laid a tax upon America, by what was called the <HI>&s;tamp-act</HI>: by which almo&s;t every written in&s;trument of a public nature was &s;ubject to a high duty. Re|qui&s;itions of men or money were no longer made as u&s;ual from the king to the colonies: but their money is now to be extorted from them by an act of the Briti&s;h parliament. 'Tis doubtle&s;s fre&s;h in your memories, what an alarm this <HI>new</HI> claim of parliament gave to the colonies; what unanimous and vigorous oppo&s;ition was made to the execution of the act: the &s;tampt pa|pers were either de&s;troyed, or kept from being di&s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">buted throughout America: Trade with Great Britain was in a good degree &s;u&s;pended:&mdash;In &s;hort, a glorious &s;truggle was made again&s;t this <HI>fir&s;t</HI> exertion of a parlia|mentary claim of taxation over America. The i&s;&s;ue of the &s;truggle was happy. The parliament the next &s;e&s;&s;i|on, repealed the act, tho' not upon the principles it
<PB N="52" REF="013614_0049_0F905B704E14B898">
could have been wi&s;hed for, i. e. of its being <HI>uncon&s;tituti|onal</HI>; but upon the footing of its being <HI>inexpedient</HI> and ill-&s;uited to the &s;tate of the colonies. The parliament &s;till claimed a right of making &s;tatutes to bind the co|lonies in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. They &s;till claimed the right of taxing them at plea&s;ure. Duties were accord|ingly laid upon &s;undry articles of merchandize payable upon their landing in America, as on <HI>tea, gla&s;s, paint|ers colours,</HI> &amp;c. part of which were afterwards taken off by parliament. There are al&s;o duties that have here|tofore been laid on other articles of trade; but as they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be laid only to defray the expences of regulating trade; the colonies acquie&s;ced in them with|out any complaint: but the duties on tea, &amp;c. being for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue to his ma|je&s;ty, and being in con&s;equence of the parliament's claim to make &s;tatutes to bind the colonies in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, excited continual murmurs and com|plaints in the colonies: however as the tax was incon|&s;iderable, it rai&s;ed no con&s;iderable tumults. Soon after this <HI>new admiralty courts</HI> were erected throughout Ame|rica. The powers of which courts were extended much beyond what they are in England, or what they had been in America. But as I have not by me, the act of par|liament con&s;tituting tho&s;e courts, I can only ob&s;erve upon them in general as what Americans complain of. An expen&s;ive <HI>Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> for managing the revenue were con&s;tituted with the mo&s;t extravagant powers.&mdash;They have power to con&s;titute as many un|der officers as they plea&s;e; they are impowered to de|mand <HI>general warrants</HI> from the judges of courts in America: i. e. warrants to &s;earch any body, and any where for contraband goods; under pretence of which, they may &s;earch any man's mo&s;t private apartments; not even his de&s;k or drawers, or any thing would be &s;ecure. But as I am not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the act con&s;titut|ing this board, I cannot be further particular upon it. The judges of the admiralty and the commi&s;&s;ioners have
<PB N="53" REF="013614_0050_0F905B706850F028">
both the mo&s;t extravagant &s;alaries; the former each <HI>&s;ix hundred,</HI> the latter <HI>five hundred</HI> pounds &s;terling per annum, paid out of the American revenue, be&s;ides the perqui&s;ites of their offices. And yet it has been report|ed of one at lea&s;t of the&s;e judges of admiralty, that for two years or more he has had but one ca&s;e to try. The&s;e, with a &s;warm of petty cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers ap|pointed by the commi&s;&s;ioners, exhau&s;t almo&s;t the whole of the revenue. It is &s;aid, there was but 86<HI>l.</HI> the la&s;t year paid into the king's exchequer. So that all the money rai&s;ed is &s;pent to maintain a &s;et of <HI>idle drones</HI> in ea&s;e and luxury, without doing any &s;ervice to their king or country. The colonies from a reluctance to pay the&s;e, as they deemed them, uncon&s;titutional duties, have, it is probable, purcha&s;ed a con&s;iderable part of their teas from the Dutch; by which means the quan|tity imported from Great Britain hath been much le&s;s &s;ince the duty was laid than before; which cau&s;ed an immen&s;e quantity of tea to lie upon the hands of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> company. With the approbation, if not by the propo&s;al of the mini&s;try, they re&s;olve to &s;end a large quantity of it to America upon their own ri&s;k. Several &s;hips loaded with tea were accordingly &s;ent to &s;everal different ports in America. This gave a gene|ral alarm thro' the Colonies. They tho't the mother country was now re&s;olved to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> the chains of &s;lave|ry upon them; as they would not leave us at our own option whether we would import the Tea or not; but were re&s;olved to force it upon us. A general re&s;oluti|on &s;eems therefore to have been come into throughout the colonies, not to &s;uffer the tea to be landed. Accor|dingly at Philadelphia, New-York and Port&s;mouth, and I am apt to think from &s;ome other parts of Ame|rica; al&s;o, they per&s;uaded the ma&s;ters of the &s;hips to return to England, without unlading. At Bo&s;ton, the governor would not &s;uffer the tea &s;hip to pa&s;s the ca&s;|tle without a clearance. A clearance could not be ob|tained without &s;he entered and unladed. So that there
<PB N="54" REF="013614_0051_0F905B7118A96678">
was no other alternative, the people mu&s;t either &s;uffer the tea to be landed or de&s;troy it; accordingly a num|ber of per&s;ons went in di&s;gui&s;e and emptied it all into the &s;ea. At New-York al&s;o a quantity of the &s;ame tea was de&s;troyed in like manner. When news was re|ceived in England, of the de&s;troying of the tea in Bo&s;ton; the mini&s;try thinking that a proper opportunity now pre&s;ented, for carrying the de&s;igns they had long &s;ince formed into execution, immediately hurried thro' the parliament, the act for blocking up the harbour of the town of Bo&s;ton. This act forbids the &s;hipping or landing any kind of merchandize what&s;oever, (except fuel and victuals for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;tenance of the inhabitants of the town) any where within Bo&s;ton bay.

By this act all the trade of the town of Bo&s;ton is &s;topped, which was the whole &s;upport of the town; and 'tis calculated to di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> them much in procuring provi&s;ions.

<P>There is another act lately parted in the Briti&s;h par|liament, for regulating the government of the province of Quebec, which greatly alarms the nation in gene|ral as well as America in particular. Thou&s;ands of Engli&s;h people have &s;ettled in that province under the faith of a royal proclamation, that the Engli&s;h laws &s;hould take place there, and a government like that of the other colonies as &s;oon as the circum&s;tances of the province would permit.

<P>Thus I have related the principal facts with re&s;pect to America on which the pre&s;ent grievances and dan|gerous pro&s;pects of the Americans are founded.

<P><PB N="57" REF="013614_0054_0F905B7369D2AE28">The fir&s;t thing we complain of as a grievance is, that by taxing the colonies for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a re|venue, and claiming a right to make laws or &s;tatutes in all ca&s;es binding on the Colonies, the parliament claim what they have no right to, by the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution, and thereby deny us our <HI>natural</HI> rights as men, and our <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> rights as Engli&s;hmen. This I will con&s;ider &s;omewhat particularly, as 'tis at the foundation of our complaints: for if the parliament have rightfully &s;uch a power as this, the Americans only are to blame in the pre&s;ent di&s;putes, that &s;ub&s;i&s;t between Great-Britain and the Colonies: In order to which we may with propriety advert a little to the foundation of civil government in general, and the principles of the Briti&s;h government in particular.</P>
<P>That, which induces any number of individuals to enter into compact for civil government, is the greater &s;ecurity of their lives and properties; which in a &s;tate of nature are expo&s;ed to every invader, and liable to be taken away with impunity by any one that is &s;trong|er than we. In a &s;ociety formed for the purpo&s;es of government, there is the united power of the whole to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch injurious invaders. It is the duty of tho&s;e who thus combine together for government to give up &s;o much of their property into the hands of tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with authority, as is nece&s;&s;ary to carry on government: But then it would be very prepo&s;terous, when they entered into &s;ociety to &s;ecure their property, to give it up to be wholly at the di&s;|po&s;al of any one man or body of men: this would be to put their property in a wor&s;e &s;tate than the &s;tate of nature. 'Tis therefore to be pre&s;umed that every body of people entering into compact for civil government will keep the di&s;po&s;al of their property&punc; in their own hands, and make grants of it to their rulers as the exi|gencies of government &s;hall require: otherwi&s;e they put it into the power of their rulers to exerci&s;e every kind of tyranny over them. And thus it is &s;aid with
<PB N="58" REF="013614_0055_0F905B74119F69E0">
the greate&s;t propriety, that every man hath a natural right to di&s;po&s;e of his <HI>own</HI> property.

In that great <HI>charter</HI> of liberties, commonly called <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> which our ance&s;tors obtained by the mo&s;t painful &s;truggles; 'tis a fundamental article&punc; that no man &s;hall be taxed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t by his own con&s;ent: But as every individual of the nation cannot meet to grant taxes; there becomes a nece&s;&s;ity of their meeting by repre&s;entation; and accordingly the Briti&s;h parliament repre&s;ent all the people of Great-Britain; are cho&s;en by them, and the <HI>&s;ole</HI> right of granting money is ve&s;ted in them: Neither the king nor hou&s;e of lords have power to rai&s;e one penny of money upon the &s;ubject: And as the parliament when they grant money to the king, tax them&s;elves in common with others, and as they are expo&s;ed to lo&s;e their places the next election, if they do not conduct according to the mind of their con&s;tituents; the people have the greate&s;t &s;ecurity that can be, that they will grant no more money than what the purpo&s;es of government, the good of the communi|ty, and the honour of the nation require. So likewi&s;e are our lives mo&s;t admirably guarded in that charter

of privileges which our forefathers obtained: In which 'tis provided that no man &s;hall be impri&s;oned but by the laws of the land&mdash;No man's life &s;hall be taken away, (either by the king or judges appointed by him,) but by the voice of his country repre&s;ented by twelve hone&s;t men of the neighbourhood where the crime is committed, called together in &s;ome impartial manner; who, 'tis to be pre&s;umed, can have no intere&s;t in acting otherwi&s;e than ju&s;tly. The&s;e two. viz. the right of taxing them&s;elves, and trials by jury, e&s;pecially in capi|tal ca&s;es, have ever been deemed by the people of England their fundamental privileges; the violation of which was the principal cau&s;e of that dreadful civil war in England about a century ago, which at la&s;t brought an arbitrary king to the block. A violation of the&s;e, with other attempts to &s;ubvert the con&s;tituti|on, dethroned king JAMES the &s;econd, and advanced WILLIAM and MARY to the throne. So jealous have Engli&s;hmen ever been of the&s;e important rights and privileges. Now the fir&s;t of the&s;e the parliament go di|rectly in the face of&punc; when they lay taxes on the Ame|ricans; as we are not repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parlia|ment, and by rea&s;on of our di&s;tance can never have an equal repre&s;entation there. When they lay taxes on us, they feel none of the burdens they impo&s;e; and we have no influence over them, as the people of Eng|land have, by dropping the members of parliament, if they conduct wrong&punc; at the next election. They do in reallity take away our money from us by force, and make a pre&s;ent of it to the king. 'Tis not that we are again&s;t contributing to defray the expences of go|vernment, that cau&s;es us to complain of the&s;e taxes: But becau&s;e our money is forced from us in an illegal manner, in direct violation of that fundamental privilege of Engli&s;hmen, <HI>a right to tax them&s;elves</HI>&punc; The colonies are repre&s;ented in their re&s;pective general a&s;&s;emblies, and no where el&s;e; and whenever the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing hath made requi&s;itions to them of men and money, they have ever

readily granted them: And would his maje&s;ty <HI>a&s;k</HI> his good &s;ubjects in America, as he doth the people of Britain a&s;&s;embled in parliament, for money to defray the charges of government, I am bold to &s;ay they would readily grant it.</P>
<P>Altho' the privilege of trial by juries is not as yet ta|ken away from the colonies in general; yet the advan|tage of it is much le&s;&s;ened in the province of the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay; as it is in the power of the &s;heriff to pack &s;uch a jury as he plea&s;es; who being appointed <HI>&s;olely</HI> by the governor, it may be pre&s;umed will ever be a <HI>creature</HI> of his; and al&s;o by the governor's having power to remove capital trials out of the province, or even to Britain, where a jury cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o a|dequate judges, as one collected from the neighbour|hood where the crime was committed. The admiral|ty courts, 'tis complained of, are in many ca&s;es an in|fringment upon this important privilege. In Canada trial by juries is wholly taken away; and who but ju&s;t|ly fears that this is a &s;ample by which the other colo|nies may e're long be modelled.</P>
<P>The late acts re&s;pecting the province of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay are looked upon by Americans to be <HI>grie|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous</HI> in many re&s;pects; to that province immediately; to the other colonies as they afford a precedent of the treatment they may expect to receive, whenever they &s;hall happen to fall under the re&s;entment of the Briti&s;h court, and as it opens to view the adopted plan for the government of the colonies. To begin with that called the <HI>port act,</HI> or the act for blocking up the harbour of the town of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, if we look into the preamble of this act, we &s;hall find the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned are, that <HI>divers ill affected per&s;ons have fomented and rai&s;ed dangerous com|motions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in which certain valuable cargoes of tea were de&s;troyed.</HI>" h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e you &s;ee 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed that the whole people are not guilty, but only <HI>divers ill affected per&s;ons,</HI> yet the whole town is puni&s;hed, <HI>men, women, and chil|dren.</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="013614_0058_0F905B7A4866AA50">
Why did not the parliament enable his maje&s;ty to puni&s;h tho&s;e <HI>ill affected per&s;ons,</HI> and not bring ruin on a whole country for the crime of a few individuals? 'Tis not probable that more than a hundredth part of the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton were concerned in this af|fair, yet this is the only rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for puni&s;hing the whole. Is it not the part of ju&s;tice to &s;ever between the guilty and the innocent and not to puni&s;h all in the lump? And have not other colonies been guilty of the like conduct? New-York de&s;troyed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;ide|rable quantity of the &s;ame tea. Philadelphia forci|bly &s;ent back a large cargo to the great detriment of the Ea&s;t-India company; yet Bo&s;ton only is &s;ingled out to be the object of mini&s;terial vengeance. It plain|ly appears they mean to take but <HI>one</HI> at a time, and thus by dividing the colonies to bring them one after another to &s;ubmit to the yoke.</P>
<P>Again, if you look further into this mon&s;trous pro|duction, you will find that all the immen&s;e e&s;tates lying in wharves, water lots, &amp;c. clear round Bo&s;ton bay are really <HI>confiscated</HI> to the king: for if ever &s;atisfaction is made according to the requirements of the act, 'tis ex|pre&s;sly left with the king, to licen&s;e only &s;uch wharves and landing places as he plea&s;es. Now wharves are worth nothing, if there may be no landing upon them: their water lots are worth very little, if they may not build wharves upon them; or may not u&s;e them when built. So that the property of the&s;e e&s;tates, all in a manner that is va|luable in them, is wre&s;ted from the original owners and ve&s;ted with the king: With equal right might the parliament to vote the king the landed e&s;tate of any per|&s;on in this or any other province: And if becau&s;e there hath been a riot or mi&s;chief done by &s;ome individuals, the parliament may vote to the king the e&s;tate of any per&s;on that happens to lie in the town or country where committed: In what a dreadful &s;ituation are we? Here is not only claimed, but actually exerci&s;ed; not mere|ly
<PB N="62" REF="013614_0059_0F905B7AEAD86DF8">
a right of taxation, but of granting our e&s;tates, ju&s;t as the Briti&s;h parliament plea&s;es. A precedent ju&s;tly alarming to all the colonies!</P>
<P>If you look &s;till further into this oppre&s;&s;ive act, you will find it inforced by &s;uch penalties as never act was. If any goods are landed or &s;hipped from any wharf or landing-place within Bo&s;ton bay; not only the ve&s;&s;el and cargoes, with all the hor&s;es, carriages, cattle and and every uten&s;il concerned in carrying them are for|feit; but a fine treble the value of the goods at the highe&s;t price is laid upon any per&s;on that &s;hall be &s;o much as aiding or abetting. What &s;hocking &s;everity! And where are the&s;e fines to be recovered? Not in the common courts of ju&s;tice where there might be a fair trial by jury: but in the courts of admiralty; where the king, who is to receive the fine, is both judge and jury, as well as party concerned. And the difficulties every ve&s;&s;el is laid under that goes in with provi&s;ions, &s;eem as if de&s;igned, if not to &s;tarve them, at lea&s;t to rai&s;e the price of provi&s;ions &s;o high, as to force them to yield. And le&s;t the officers on the coa&s;t &s;hould have &s;ome humane and compa&s;&s;ionate feelings towards their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fellow &s;ubjects in Bo&s;ton; a fine of 500<HI>l.</HI> &s;ter|ling is laid on any one that &s;hall &s;o much as connive at the lea&s;t breach of the act.</P>
<P>Again 'tis put out of the power of parliament to grant redre&s;s to Bo&s;ton: 'tis lodged with the king when to remove the rigours of the act: yet he is re&s;tricted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll full &s;atisfaction is made for the tea de&s;troyed by, or in behalf of the town of Bo&s;ton; but who can it be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pected will do it in their behalf? and the town can do it in no other way than by a tax upon the inhabi|tants, thus involving the innocent with the guilty. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The following quotation I find in the London Magazine for July 1774. p. 345.

<P>"It mu&s;t again be noticed that no relief is to be had "until full &s;atisfaction hath been made <HI>by</HI> or <HI>on</HI> behalf of the inhabitants of &s;aid town of Bo&s;ton." Now to &s;uppo&s;e that any in England or Europe would make &s;atisfaction on behalf of &s;aid inhabitants was unnatural, if not ab&s;urd; but what is more to the point, it was certainly <HI>unparliamentary.</HI> The remaining alternative is that &s;atisfaction mu&s;t be made <HI>by</HI> Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on knows that towns in this province cannot rai&s;e or appropriate any monies, but by the expre&s;s provi&s;ions and direct authority of law: it is a matter of equal notoriety, that all town a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments of money are expre&s;ly confined by the 4 Wm. &amp; Mar. c. 13. to the maintenance and &s;upport of the mini&s;try, &s;chools, the poor, and defraying of other <HI>nece&s;&s;ary town charges.</HI> A law which received the royal approbation almo&s;t a century ago.</P>
<P>Will any now &s;ay, that the monies appointed to be paid to the Ea&s;t India hou&s;e come within the words of <HI>nece&s;&s;ary town charges?</HI> When did the town contract the debt or how are they &s;ubject to the payment of it?

and others for all the abu&s;es they have received for &s;everal months before. Now how is it po&s;&s;ible to know when they have complied with the requirements of the act? Let them be ever &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to make &s;a|tisfaction, no mortal can tell when it is done. They are left wholly at the mercy of their governor; who by office, if not by inclination (as one expre&s;&s;es it) is &s;up|po&s;ed to be a mere tool of arbitrary power. Never was there a completer in&s;trument of tyranny, (if any are wicked enough to make &s;uch an u&s;e of it) than the Bo&s;ton port act.</P>
<P>And over and above all this, this act which brings &s;uch an heavy calamity upon the town of Bo&s;ton and the whole province, and e&s;tabli&s;hes &s;uch a fatal pre|cedent with re&s;pect to the parliament's power over the colonies, was pa&s;&s;ed without ever allowing the party therein concerned, an opportunity to make their defence, or even &s;o much as their agents to &s;peak in their behalf; and when (as has been often reported) full &s;atisfaction was offered by the merchants in London for all damage the Ea&s;t-India company had &s;uffered from the de&s;troying of their tea.</P>
<P>"Here the &s;ons of tyranny in America; the ba&s;e advocates for parliamentary power; may &s;ee the ble&s;|&s;ed fruit of their doctrine: may &s;ee a &s;pecimen of what the other Colonies may expect from that exorbitant power they are at &s;uch pains to ju&s;tify." Strange that any &s;hould dare to hold up their heads among a free people in defence of &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive claims, as are here exerted.</P>
<P>But let us attend to the other late acts re&s;pecting the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay; both of which were hurried thro' the parliament with the utmo&s;t pre|cipitancy, without ever allowing the province con|demned an opportunity to &s;peak in their own behalf. One of the&s;e in open defiance of the royal charter, in which the word of the king mo&s;t &s;olemnly given had guaranteed to them that form of government, they had

Under the faith of charters &s;olemnly given, our fathers plant|ed this wilderne&s;s; built towns and cities&mdash;extended the commerce, the power, the glory of Britain. But now the&s;e &s;acred privileges thus &s;olemnly confirmed are to be &s;ubject to the caprice of an in&s;olent mini&s;ter. And then the principle upon which the parliament avowedly proceeded, that whenever they judged it expedient &amp; advantageous to the public, they had a right to &s;et chart|ers a&s;ide, greatly aggravates the evil. For upon this principle, if they judge it expedient, they may &s;et a&s;ide all grants of land, all patents from the king (for none of the&s;e are more &s;olemn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;acred than charters) and thus might cau&s;e all our lands to revert into the hands of the king. This principle nullifies all &s;ecurity of our property. In &s;hort, upon this principle the parliament may in the plenitude of their power, de|prive us of every valuable enjoyment we po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>The other act, which allows the governor to remove capital trials out of the province even to England, &s;eems calculated with a mo&s;t barefaced de&s;ign to &s;creen the &s;oldiers and cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers from puni&s;hment, when they &s;hould be guilty of any exce&s;&s;es. As tho' a mercile&s;s &s;oldiery and tho&s;e harpies and blood-&s;uckers the officers of the cu&s;toms would not be rigorous enough in executing the&s;e arbitrary laws, without a promi&s;e of impunity. For who would run the ri&s;k to cro&s;s the atlantic, more than 3000 miles to carry on a pro&s;ecuti|on again&s;t them? Or if adventrous end, how would it be po&s;&s;ible to procure evidence?

<P>Again the <HI>Quebec government act</HI> the colonies have ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain of.

But <HI>popery</HI> is now e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, tythes are collected by law for it's &s;upport; which &s;hews &s;uch a di&s;regard for the <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> religion as we never &s;hould expect in the reign of one of the hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> who were called to the Briti&s;h throne to be guardians of the prote&s;tant religion. And tho' there are thou&s;ands of Engli&s;h &s;ettled in that province, yet no provi&s;ion is made for the &s;upport of a prote&s;tant clergy; there is only a re&s;erve, that the king may make &s;uch provi&s;ion, if he &s;ees fit. Now when &s;uch favour is &s;hewn to the bloody religion of Rome, it argues ei|ther a <HI>favourable</HI> di&s;po&s;ition in the parliament towards that religion; or that it is done, in order to carry on &s;ome other <HI>favorite</HI> &s;cheme. Again trials by juries are
<PB N="67" REF="013614_0064_0F905B7E9FA1AFD0">
aboli&s;hed by this act: which is injurious, at lea&s;t to the Engli&s;h inhabitants, who under the faith of a royal proclamation, promi&s;ing Engli&s;h privileges have &s;ettled there. As the government of Canada is now entirely after the model of the arbitrary government of France, 'tis to be feared this is de&s;igned as a precedent for what is to be done in the other colonies; or at lea&s;t we may &s;uppo&s;e, without much conjecture, that the French in|habitants of Canada are gratified with an e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>popery</HI> and a re&s;toration of their former laws; to en|gage them to be <HI>true</HI> to the mini&s;try in any future &s;truggles with the colonies: A military government is continued there; that they may always have a good body of troops at hand, to join the Canadians and In|dians to pour down upon the back of us, if the mini|&s;try &s;hould find occa&s;ion to u&s;e them. And that this <HI>French</HI> arbitrary government may take in as much of America as po&s;&s;ible, it's limits are extended &s;outhward to the O|hio, and we&s;tward to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi: &s;o that it com|prehends an extent of teritory almo&s;t as large as all the other provinces. When this va&s;t extent of territory comes to be filled up with inhabitants, near half Ame|rica will be under this arbitrary <HI>French</HI> government. So that upon the whole the Quebec act doubtle&s;s wears as threatning an a&s;pect upon Americans as any act that hath been pa&s;&s;ed by the Briti&s;h parliament. Thus I have hinted to you &s;ome of the principal grievances which the Americans judge they labour under from the <HI>late</HI> acts of the Briti&s;h parliament.</P>
<P>Indulge me a little longer while I endeavour to point out what we have <HI>ju&s;t</HI> rea&s;on to fear the con&s;equences of the&s;e mea&s;ures will be. If we view the whole of the conduct of the mini&s;try and parliament, I do not &s;ee how any one can doubt but that there is a &s;ettled fix'd plan for <HI>in&s;laving</HI> the colonies, or bringing them under arbitra|ry government, and indeed the nation too. The pre|&s;ent parliament have ever been (by all accounts) more devoted to the intere&s;t of the mini&s;try, than perhaps e|ver a parliament were. Now notwith&s;tanding the ex|cellency
<PB N="68" REF="013614_0065_0F905B7F9065A990">
of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, if the mini&s;try can &s;ecure a majority in parliament, who will come into all their mea&s;ures, will vote as they bid them; they may rule as ab&s;olutely as they do in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> yea as in <HI>Turkey</HI> or <HI>India</HI>: And this &s;eems to be the pre&s;ent plan to &s;ecure a majority of parliament, and thus en&s;lave the nation with their own con&s;ent.

when in open defiance of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, they claim a right to tax us, and thus deprive us of our deare&s;t privileges?</P>
<P>In the mean time we mu&s;t expect our <HI>charters</HI> will fall a &s;acrifice to the&s;e arbitrary claims. Charter governments have long been di&s;agreable to the powers in Britain. The <HI>free</HI> con&s;titution of the&s;e colonies makes them &s;uch nur&s;eries of freemen as cannot fail to alarm an arbitrary mini&s;try. They only wait a favourable opportunity to aboli&s;h their charters, as they have done that of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. We know the principle the parliament have adopted and openly profe&s;s to act upon, that they have a right to alter or annihilate charters when they judge it conve|nient: And we may depend upon it, whenever they &s;hall think it can be done without rai&s;ing too great commotions in the colonies, they will judge it conve|nient. Some may imagine it was the de&s;troying the tea induced the parliament to change the government of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. If it was, &s;urely 'tis very extraordinary to puni&s;h a whole province and their po&s;|terity thro' all ages, for the conduct of a few indivi|duals. How &s;oon will a roit or &s;ome di&s;order of a few individuals, afford them a pretext for the like treatment of all the other charter governments. I be|lieve, however, it may be made very evident, that the de&s;troying the tea was not the rea&s;on for altering the goverment of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay; but that it was a fix'd plan long before, and they only waited a co|lourable pretext for carrying it into execution. It has been reported by gentlemen of unque&s;tionable veraci|ty, that they had inconte&s;tible evidence that the two bills for altering the government of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay were ordered by the council to be drawn up by the crown lawyers more than two years ago. Now if this be true (as it undoubtedly is) 'tis quite certain the mi|ni&s;try were only waiting for &s;ome colourable pretext for carrying their de&s;ign into execution. The char|ter governments are by this precedent reduced not

merely to the greate&s;t uncertainty of the continuance of their charters; but may be quite certain, it the pre|&s;ent plan is pro&s;ecuted, they will be taken away, and the&s;e colonies reduced, (if nothing wor&s;e) to the &s;tate of the royal governments; their governors, councils, judges, &amp;c. will be appointed from England, with high and extravagant &s;alaries.</P>
<P>There is great rea&s;on to fear the next &s;tep will be the vacating all grants and patents of land from the king; that all our landed property may revert to his maje&s;ty; to be regranted under &s;uch <HI>quit rents and &s;ervices</HI> as tho&s;e in power &s;hall &s;ee fit to impo&s;e: Nor will <HI>this fear</HI> appear chimerical to any one that duly con&s;iders what hath been already done, and what the plan is, which the mini&s;try are doubtle&s;s pur&s;uing. 'Twould be weak policy indeed for an arbitrary mi|ni&s;try to pu&s;h with all their horns at fir&s;t. But cer|tainly it doth not require very great &s;agacity to &s;ee that their mea&s;ures are tending to this. When it was re&s;olved to introduce arbitrary and de&s;potic govern|ment into the colonies in the reign of king JAMES 2d. when Sir <HI>Edmond Andro&s;s</HI> was governor of New-Eng|land; the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;tep was to vacate the charters; the very <HI>next</HI> to revoke the grants of land that had been made:<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The charter being vacated, the people were told that their titles to their e&s;tates were of no value. The expre&s;&s;ion in vogue was, that "the calf died in the cow's belly." "The fees for the pa|tents varied according to circum&s;tances both of per&s;ons and e&s;tates. In the complaint to king James, it is alleged that the &s;ees of &s;ome amounted to 50l. Prudence was u&s;ed. Men's titles were not que&s;tioned all at once. Had this been the ca&s;e according to the computation then made, all the per&s;onal e&s;tates in the colony, would not have paid the charge of the new patents." <BIBL><HI>Gov. Hutchin&s;on's Hi&s;t.

We &s;ee our charters are already &s;truck at; a claim is advanc|ed by the parliament to di&s;&s;olve them at plea&s;ure: And what is there more &s;acred in grants of land, than in charters; that the former may not be annulled with as

much right as the latter. Our fathers when they planted this wilderne&s;s, placed equal confidence in the royal word pledged in their charters; as in the patents by which they held their land: and deemed the privi|leges granted in the former of as much worth; as the property granted by the latter. The principle upon which the parliament proceeded in vacating the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts charter; will equally warrant them, when|ever they &s;hall &s;ee fit, to vacate all our grants of lands, i. e. when they &s;hall judge it expedient, or for the good of the nation. If the parliament &s;hould once take it into their wi&s;e heads, that it is expedient, or for the general good, that all lands in America &s;hould re|vert to the crown, that they may be regranted all upon the &s;ame tenure,&mdash;upon large <HI>quit-rents</HI> to defray the charges of government; what will hinder their car|rying it into execution? And indeed the Bo&s;ton <HI>port act</HI> doth actually afford us a precedent of the exerci&s;e of this power: all their wharves and water-lots round the whole of Bo&s;ton bay, are really <HI>confi&s;cated</HI> to the king (as we have already &s;hewn.) Now what is this but a vote of parliament to take away our landed pro|perty. And that power which hath been once exer|ci&s;ed have we not all rea&s;on to fear will be exerci&s;ed again.</P>
<P>And have we not ju&s;t grounds to fear that all this will not be the completion of their oppre&s;&s;ive plan, if the mini&s;try find them&s;elves &s;ucce&s;sful in their fir&s;t at|tempts? By the <HI>Quebec-Act</HI> we find the parliament claim a power to e&s;tabli&s;h in <HI>America,</HI> the &s;ame arbitra|ry government that takes place in <HI>France.</HI>&mdash;To take away trials by juries:&mdash;to &s;et a&s;ide general a&s;&s;emblies: &mdash;to ve&s;t the king with a power to appoint legi&s;lative councils &amp;c.

By the &s;ame right they could e&s;tabli&s;h this form of government over the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in Canada; they may do it in the other provinces. In the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, the important privilege of being tried by a jury, is greatly <HI>le&s;&s;ened</HI> by &s;etting a&s;ide the equitable and impartial method by which juries were wont to be panel'd. Viewing the things that have taken place, is it without foundation that I expre&s;s my fears, that the Briti&s;h mini&s;try will e'er long find our general a&s;&s;emblies trouble&s;ome things?&mdash;a hindrance to government and the like, and &s;o &s;et them a&s;ide, under a notion of their being <HI>inexpe|dient,</HI> and lodge the whole legi&s;lative power in a coun|cil appointed by the king. This is the very thing that took place in <HI>Sir Edmond</HI>'s time. The whole legi&s;lative power was lodged in him and his council. And &s;ince the previous &s;teps are &s;o like what took place then, why may we not expect the con&s;equent ones will be &s;o too? And very likely the mini&s;try may find <HI>juries</HI> e|qually a bar to the government they mean to e&s;tabli&s;h: and &s;o may per&s;uade the parliament, on the footing of expediency to aboli&s;h them likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>And when our civil rights and privileges &s;hall have thus fallen a &s;acrifice to tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, our religious liberties cannot long &s;urvive: for where hath it ever been known that civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyran|ny and de&s;poti&s;m have not yet gone hand in hand to|gether. The latter is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to uphold and &s;up|port the former, that arbitrary princes or mini&s;ters of &s;tate have ever found their intere&s;t in the encourage|ment of it. And &s;hould America be forced to yield in the pre&s;ent &s;truggle for civil liberty, we have no rea&s;on to expect but eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, will like a mighty torrent over&s;pread our land.

A very little attention mu&s;t convince every one of the nece&s;&s;ity of our being united. If the colonies

are divided o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the people in the &s;everal colonies are very con&s;iderably divided, we are undone. Nothing but the united efforts of America can &s;ave us: and if united, they mu&s;t have that weight, which gives me the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. It &s;hould then be the con|cern of every one to labour as far as his influence ex|tends, to promote this nece&s;&s;ary union. The determinati|ons of the congre&s;s of delegates from the &s;everal colonies may be deemed the general voice of America. A concur|rence with the&s;e we &s;hould every one labour to promote. If in every particular we &s;hould not be entirely &s;uited; yet the dreadful con&s;equences of di&s;union &s;hould make us cautious how we let it be known. The Congre&s;s we hear have come into a conclu&s;ion that we <HI>import</HI> no Briti&s;h goods. This is a mea&s;ure for redre&s;s, of which we may very &s;afely and ea&s;ily make trial. We can with a little &s;elf-denial do without the &s;uperfluities we receive from Britain. This will doubtle&s;s be di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing to the Mother Country and may convince them of the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing to us our dear bought rights and privileges. No friend of his country can he&s;itate a moment in &s;uch a cau&s;e to deny him&s;elf the &s;uper|fluities of Britain. And &s;hould the Congre&s;s agree al&s;o upon <HI>non-exportation</HI>; and extend both this and the other, not only to Great-Britain but to Ireland and the We&s;t-Indies; a general compliance with which, will mo&s;t certainly, according to the ordinary cour&s;e of things, en&s;ure us redre&s;s, and of which nece&s;&s;ity mo&s;t certainly will be a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification: Should this I &s;ay be agreed upon by the Congre&s;s; none I hope will be &s;o inimical to his country, as to attempt to break the general union by refu&s;ing to comply there|with. But &s;hould there be any &s;uch; it becomes eve|ry one, that hath any regard to the liberties of his country, to treat with de&s;erved neglect and abhorrence the wretch, that thus meanly &s;eeks his own e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lument upon the ruins of his country's liberties:&mdash;To break off all trade and dealings with &s;uch &s;elfi&s;h mi&s;creants; and make them &s;en&s;ible, that without injuring their

lives or property, their injured country can make them feel the weight of her vengeance, and rue the day they ever &s;uffered a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit to bani&s;h all love to their country from their brea&s;ts. Here is a &s;phere in which every one can contribute &s;omething to &s;ave his &s;inking country from ruin. Suffer me then to intreat you (of the we&s;tern parts of the colony of Connecticut) in &s;ome proper way to &s;hew your hearty concurrence with other parts of the continent in the cau&s;e of American liberty; and your re&s;olution to concur with, and endeavour to carry into execution the conclu&s;ions of the American Congre&s;s; and to open your hearts to commi&s;erate, and contribute to the relief of the &s;uffering poor of the town of Bo&s;ton. What hath been &s;aid I tru&s;t makes it &s;uf|ficiently appear, that they are &s;uffering in the common cau&s;e of American liberty. Allowing the conduct of tho&s;e individuals who de&s;troyed the tea as criminal as any are di&s;po&s;ed to make it, yet the puni&s;hment is be|yond all bounds di&s;proportionate to the crime:&mdash;the innocent are involved with the guilty:&mdash;the require|ments of the act are &s;uch, that it can never be known whether complied with or not:&mdash;The act is as com|pleat an in&s;trument of tyranny as ever was formed.&mdash;If the requirements of the act &s;hould be complied with; yet all their e&s;tates lying in wharves, water-lots, &amp;c. will &s;till lie at the king's mercy. So that the act can|not be complied with without giving up the &s;truggle for liberty. The de&s;ign in bearing thus hard upon one colo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is evidently to divide the colonies; and thus to bring them one after another to &s;ubmit to the arbitrary claims of parliament. All their means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depended on their trade, which by this act is wholly taken away. So that without a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the other colonies, they mu&s;t inevitably yield, unle&s;s&punc; &s;o very pa|triotic, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be willing to &s;tarve to death. Our turn may &s;oon come when we may want the like kind a&s;&s;i&s;|tance from our brethren. Only apply the golden rule of "doing to others as we would that they &s;hould do unto us," and &s;urely we cannot he&s;itate to contribute to

their relief. We in this colony are &s;ituated nearer to them and on various accounts are more nearly connected with them than mo&s;t of the other colonies. Our trade hath been principally with them;&mdash;our religion and manners are very &s;imilar to theirs:&mdash;We originated mainly from the &s;ame ance&s;tors; mo&s;t of our towns derived their fir&s;t inhabitants from that province; the re&s;t are de&s;cended from ance&s;tors that left their native land for the &s;ame cau&s;e with the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts planters: So that it will be to our la&s;ting &s;hame, if more back|ward to contribute to their relief, than other colonies much more remote, and under no &s;uch &s;pecial connec|tions as we are. Many towns in the ea&s;tern and north|ern parts of this colony have &s;ent very generou&s;ly to their relief, others are now making collections for this purpo&s;e.
