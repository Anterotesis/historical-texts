<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR de&s;ign in the appointment of this ceremony, <HI>my Friends, and Fellow-Town&s;men,</HI> cannot fail to be examined in quite different lights at this &s;ea&s;on of political di&s;&s;ention. From the principles I profe&s;s, and in the exerci&s;e of my common right to judge with others, I conclude it was <HI>decent, wi&s;e, and honorable.</HI></P>
<P>The certainty of being favoured with your kinde&s;t par|tiality and candor, in a poor attempt to execute the part to which you have invited me, has overcome the objection of my inability to perform it in a proper manner; and I now beg the favor of your animating countenance.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012099_0005_0F89C4A6B77FEE78">
The horrid bloody &s;cene we here commemorate, what|ever were the cau&s;es which concurred to bring it on that dreadful night, mu&s;t lead the pious and humane of every order to &s;ome &s;uitable reflections. The pious will adore the conduct of that BEING who is un&s;earchable in all his ways, and without who&s;e knowledge not a &s;ingle &s;parrow falls, in permitting an immortal &s;oul to be hurried by the flying ball, the me&s;&s;enger of death, in the twinkling of an eye, to meet the awful Judge of all it's &s;ecret actions. The humane, from having often thought with plea&s;ing rapture on the endearing &s;cenes of &s;ocial life, in all it's amiable relations, will lament with heart-felt pangs their &s;udden di&s;&s;olution by the indi&s;cretion, rage and vengeance of unruly human pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But let us leave that &s;hocking clo&s;e of one continued cour&s;e of rancor and di&s;pute from the fir&s;t moment that the troops arrived in town: that cour&s;e will now be re|pre&s;ented by your own reflexions to much more &s;olid, u&s;eful purpo&s;e than by any artful language. I hope, however, that Heaven has yet in &s;tore &s;uch happine&s;s, for this afflicted town and province, as will in time wear out the memory of all our former troubles.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="012099_0006_0F89C4A7D01A21A0">
I &s;incerely rejoice with you in the happy event of your &s;teady and united effort to prevent a &s;econd tragedy.</P>
<P>Our fathers left their native land, ri&s;qued all the dangers of the &s;ea, and came to this then-&s;avage de&s;art, with that true undaunted courage which is excited by a confidence in GOD. They came that they might here enjoy them|&s;elves, and leave to their po&s;terity the be&s;t of earthly por|tions, full <HI>Engli&s;h Liberty.</HI> You &s;howed upon the alarming call for tryal that their brave &s;pirit &s;till exi&s;ts in vigor, tho' their legacy of rights is much impaired. The &s;ympathy and active friend&s;hip of &s;ome neighboring towns upon that &s;ad occa&s;ion commands the highe&s;t gratitude of this.</P>
<P>We have &s;een and felt the ill effects of placing &s;tanding forces in the mid&s;t of <HI>populous</HI> communities; but tho&s;e are only what individuals &s;uffer. Your vote directs me to point out the fatal tendency of placing &s;uch an order in <HI>free</HI> cities&mdash;fatal indeed! <HI>Athens</HI> once was free; a citi|zen, a favorite of the people, by an artful &s;tory gained a trifling guard of fifty men; ambition taught him ways to enlarge that number; he de&s;troyed the commonwealth
<PB N="8" REF="012099_0007_0F89C4A809B4A650">
and made him&s;elf the tyrant of the <HI>Athenians. Cae&s;ar</HI> by the length of his command in <HI>Gaul</HI> got the affections of his army, marched to <HI>Rome,</HI> overthrew the &s;tate, and made him&s;elf perpetual dictator. By the &s;ame in&s;truments, many le&s;s republics have been made to fall a prey to the devouring jaws of tyrants&mdash;But, this is a &s;ubject which &s;hould never be di&s;gui&s;ed with figures; it chu&s;es the plain &s;tile of di&s;&s;er|tation.</P>
<P>The true &s;trength and &s;afety of every commonwealth or limited monarchy, is the bravery of its freeholders, its mili|tia. By brave militias they ri&s;e to grandeur, and they come to ruin by a mercenary army. This is founded on hi&s;torical facts; and the &s;ame cau&s;es will, in &s;imilar circum|&s;tances, forever produce the &s;ame effects. Ju&s;tice <HI>Black&s;tone,</HI> in his inimitably clear commentaries, tells us, that "it is extremely dangerous in a land of liberty, to make a di&s;tinct order of the profe&s;&s;ion of arms; that &s;uch an order is an object of jealou&s;ly; and that <HI>the laws and con&s;titution of England are &s;trangers to it."</HI> One article of the Bill of Rights is, that the rai&s;ing or keeping a &s;tanding army within the kingdom in a time of peace, unle&s;s it be with con&s;ent
<PB N="9" REF="012099_0008_0F89C4A8C1C2DDE0">
of parliament, is again&s;t law. The pre&s;ent army therefore, tho' called the peace <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> is kept up by one act, and governed by another; both of which expire <HI>annually.</HI> This circum&s;tance is valued as a &s;ufficient <HI>check</HI> upon the army. A le&s;s body of troops than is now maintained has, on a time, de&s;troyed a King, and fought under a parliament with great &s;ucce&s;s and glory; but, upon a motion to disband them, they turned their ma&s;ters out of doors, and fixed up others in their &s;tead. Such wild things are not again to happen, becau&s;e the parliament have power to &s;top pay|ment once a year: but, <HI>arma tenenti quis neget?</HI> which may be ea&s;ily interpreted, "who will bind <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> with his locks on?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trenchard.</NOTE></P>
<P>The bill which regulates the army, the &s;ame fine author I have mentioned &s;ays, "is <HI>in many re&s;pects ha&s;tily penned,</HI> and reduces the &s;oldier to a &s;tate of &s;lavery in the mid&s;t of a free nation. This is impolitick: for &s;laves envy the free|dom of others, and take a malicious plea&s;ure in contribut|ing to de&s;troy it."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012099_0009_0F89C4A98DCCDE10">
By this &s;candalous bill a ju&s;tice of peace is empowered to grant, <HI>without a previous oath</HI> from the military officer, a warrant to break open any (freeman's) hou&s;e, upon <HI>pretence</HI> of &s;earching for de&s;erters.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to mention one more bad tendency: 'tis this,&mdash;a &s;tanding force leads to a total neglect of militias, or tends greatly to di&s;courage them.</P>
<P>You &s;ee the danger of a &s;tanding army to the cau&s;e of freedom. If the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament con&s;ents from year to year to be expo&s;ed, it doubtle&s;s has good rea&s;ons. But when did <HI>our</HI> a&s;&s;embly pa&s;s an act to hazard all the property, the liberty and lives of their con&s;tituents? What check have <HI>we</HI> upon a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Army? Can <HI>we</HI> disband it? Can <HI>we</HI> &s;top it's pay?</P>
<P>Our own a&s;&s;emblies in <HI>America</HI> can rai&s;e an army; and <HI>our</HI> Monarch, George the 3d. by our con&s;titution takes im|mediate command. This army can <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to leave their native provinces. Will the royal chief commander &s;end

<P>Where, in the ca&s;e I have &s;tated, would be the value of the boa&s;ted <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution?</P>
<P>Who are a free people? Not tho&s;e who do not &s;uffer actual oppre&s;&s;ion; but tho&s;e who have a <HI>con&s;titutional check upon the power</HI> to oppre&s;s.</P>
<P>We are &s;laves or freemen; if, as we are called, the la&s;t, where is our check upon the following powers, <HI>France, Spain,</HI> the <HI>States of Holland,</HI> or <HI>the Briti&s;h 'Parliament?</HI> Now if any one of the&s;e (and it is quite immaterial which) has right to make the two acts in que&s;tion operate within this province, they have right to give us up to an unlimited army, under the &s;ole direction of one <HI>Saracen</HI> Commander.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012099_0011_0F89C4AAF99E5208">
Thus I have led your thoughts to <HI>that</HI> upon which I formed my conclu&s;ion, that the de&s;ign of this ceremony was <HI>decent, wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>honorable.</HI> Make the bloody 5th of <HI>March</HI> the AEra of the re&s;urrection of your birthrights, which have been murdered by the very &s;trength that nur&s;ed them in their infancy.

<P>Let us once more look into the early hi&s;tory of this province. We find that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ance&s;tors di&s;gu&s;ted in their native country at a <HI>Legi&s;lation,</HI> which they &s;aw was &s;acrificing all their rights, <HI>left its Juri&s;diction</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haec &s;unt enim fundamenta firmi&s;&s;ima no&s;trae libertatis, &s;ui quemque juris et retinendi et dimittendi e&s;&s;e dominum. <BIBL>Cic.</BIBL></NOTE>, and &s;ought, like wandering birds of pa&s;&s;age, &s;ome happier climate. Here at length they &s;ettled down. The King of <HI>England</HI> was &s;aid to be the royal<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I chu&s;e to bury a fruitful &s;ubject for any &s;atyrical genius of the family of PENN.</NOTE> landlord of this territory; with
<PB N="14" REF="012099_0013_0F89C4AC765CB7B0">
HIM they entered into mutual &s;acred compact, by which the price of tenure and the <HI>rules of management</HI> were fairly &s;tated. It is in this compact that we find OUR ONLY TRUE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY.</P>
<P>I might here enlarge upon the character of tho&s;e fir&s;t &s;ettlers, men of whom the world was little worthy; who, for a long cour&s;e of years, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by no earthly power, defended their liberty, their religion and their lives again&s;t the greate&s;t inland danger from the &s;avage natives:&mdash;but this falls not within my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. They were &s;ecure by &s;ea.</P>
<P>In our infancy, when not an over-tempting jewel for the <HI>Bourbon</HI> Crown the very <HI>name</HI> of ENGLAND &s;aved us; after|wards her <HI>fleets and armies.</HI> We wi&s;h not to depreciate the worth of that protection. Of our gold, yea of our mo&s;t fine gold, we will freely <HI>give</HI> a part. Our fathers would have done the &s;ame. But, mu&s;t we fall down and cry "let not a &s;tranger rob and kill me, O my father! let
<PB N="15" REF="012099_0014_0F89C4AD42C39888">

<P>It is &s;aid that di&s;united from <HI>Britain</HI> "we &s;hould bleed at every vein". I cannot &s;ee the con&s;equence. The <HI>States of Holland</HI> do not &s;uffer thus. But grant it true, SENACA, would prefer the LAUNCETS of <HI>France, Spain</HI> or any other power to the BOW-STRING, tho' applied by the fair hand of <HI>Britannia.</HI></P>
<P>The declarative vote of the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> is the death-warrant of <HI>our</HI> birthrights, and wants only a Czari&s;h King to put it into execution. <HI>Here</HI> then a door of &s;alva|tion is open. <HI>Great Britain</HI> may rai&s;e <HI>her</HI> fleets and armies, but it is only <HI>our own</HI> King that can direct their fire down upon our heads. He is gracious, but not omni&s;cient. He is ready to hear our APPEALS in their proper cour&s;e; and knowing him&s;elf, tho' the mo&s;t powerful prince on earth, yet, a &s;ubject under a divine con&s;titution of LAW,
<PB N="16" REF="012099_0015_0F89C4AE62E10BF0">
that law he <HI>will</HI> a&s;k and receive from the twelve Judges of <HI>England.</HI> The&s;e will prove that the claim of the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> over <HI>us</HI> is not only ILLEGAL IN ITSELF, but A DOWN-RIGHT USURPATION OF HIS PREROGATIVE as KING OF <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>A brave nation is always generous. Let us appeal therefore, at the &s;ame time, to the genero&s;ity of the PEO|PLE of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> before the tribunal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not think the QUO WARRANTO again&s;t our fir&s;t charter was tried in a proper court.</NOTE> of <HI>Europe,</HI> not to envy <HI>us</HI> the full enjoyment of the RIGHTS OF BRE|THREN.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>my Friends and Fellow Town&s;men,</HI> having declared my&s;elf an <HI>American</HI> Son of Liberty of true charter-principles; having &s;hewn the critical and dan|gerous &s;ituation of our birthrights, and the true cour&s;e for &s;peedy redre&s;s; I &s;hall take the freedom to recommend with boldne&s;s one previous &s;tep.&mdash;Let us &s;how we under|&s;tand the true value of what we are claiming.</P>

The patriot <HI>Farmer</HI> tells us, "the cau&s;e of LIBERTY is a cau&s;e of too much dignity to be &s;ullied by turbulence and tumult.&mdash;Anger produces anger; and differences, that might be accommodated by kind and re&s;pectful behaviour, may by imprudence be enlarged to an incurable rage. In quarrels&mdash;ri&s;en to a certain height, the fir&s;t cau&s;e of di&s;&s;en|tion is no longer remembered, the minds of the parties being wholly engaged in recollecting and re&s;enting the mu|tual expre&s;&s;ions of their di&s;like. When feuds have reached that fatal point, con&s;iderations of rea&s;on and equity vani&s;h; and a blind fury governs, or rather confounds all things. A people no longer regard their intere&s;t, but a gratification of their wrath."</P>
<P>We know our&s;elves &s;ubjects of common LAW: to <HI>that</HI> and the worthy <HI>executors</HI> of it let us pay a &s;teady and con|&s;cientious regard. Pa&s;t errors in this point have been writ|ten with gall by the pen of MALICE. May our future conduct be &s;uch as to make even that vile IMP lay her pen a&s;ide.</P>
