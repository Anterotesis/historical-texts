<P>O THOU ever ble&s;&s;ed and adorable Redeemer, who art God over all ble&s;&s;ed for evermore, glo|ry be to thy free grace, who ha&s;t promi&s;ed that where two or three are gathered together thou wilt be in the mid&s;t of them: Be in the mid&s;t of us, gracious God, at this time; let thy power be known and felt a|mong us; draw near unto us at this, and at every op|portunity; when we draw near unto thee, in thy pub|lick &s;ervice, may we find thee a God nigh unto us in all that we call upon thee for.&mdash;But will God, in very deed, dwell with men on the earth?

<BIBL>Matthew xviii. 20.</BIBL>
<Q>Where two or three are gathered to|gether in my Name, there am I in the Mid&s;t of them.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words our dear Redeemer &s;poke to his Di&s;ciples, and in them to all &s;ucceeding ages of the church, as an encouragement to be|lievers in every generation to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves to|gether in his name, to offer their prayers and prai&s;es unto him who hath called them out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light, to meet together for the due celebra|tion of all divine ordinances, and to pay every act of divine wor&s;hip to him who hath tran&s;lated them from the power of <HI>Satan</HI> into the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>IN the former part of the chapter he had been teach|ing them a le&s;&s;on of humility, by &s;etting a little child before them, as an an&s;wer to their que&s;tion, Who is the greate&s;t in the kingdom of Heaven? and told them, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye &s;hall not enter therein.</P>
<P>AND, having taught them how to behave towards offending brethren, he proceeds in the ver&s;e before our text: Again I &s;ay unto you, if two of you &s;hall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they &s;hall a&s;k, it &s;hall be done for them of my Father, who is in Hea|ven; for&mdash;where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them. <HI>If two of you,</HI> who are united to me by faith, &s;hall agree, &s;hall be of one mind, <HI>as touching any thing</HI> you &s;tand in need of for the advancement of your temporal or eternal in|tere&s;t, and &s;hall be de&s;irous of making known your re|que&s;t by prayer and &s;upplication unto God, and &s;hall a&s;k in faith, and in &s;uch a manner as is well-plea&s;ing in
<PB N="10" REF="012034_0009_0F8971AD337F4DC8">
his &s;ight, <HI>it &s;hall be done for you,</HI> it &s;hall be granted you of my Father, who is in Heaven; <HI>for, what&s;oever you a&s;k the Father in my name he will give it you;</HI> for the Fa|ther loveth you, becau&s;e you have loved me, and <HI>where two or three,</HI> &s;o &s;mall a number, &s;o &s;incere a few, <HI>are gathered together in my name,</HI> tru&s;ting to my merits and mediation, with a due and proper &s;en&s;e both of my maje&s;ty and my mercy, and acknowledging me to be both God and man, and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and build upon me the only foundation of all their hopes and hap|pine&s;s in time and eternity, <HI>there am I</HI> &s;piritually pre|&s;ent, ready to hear and an&s;wer their reque&s;ts, to &s;uc|cour and defend their per&s;ons, to fulfil their petitions, and &s;upply all their wants&mdash;<HI>there am I in the mid&s;t of them.</HI></P>
<P>BELOVED&mdash;This day we are a&s;&s;embled in order to &s;et apart this place for wor&s;hipping the greate&s;t and be&s;t of beings, the mo&s;t high God, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and earth, the God who ruleth over all, but who is the covenant God of the real Chri&s;tian, his great Creator, his all-merciful Redeemer and ever-ble&s;&s;ed Sanctifier; and this office hath devolved upon unworthy me. Had it been the will of him who doth as he plea&s;es among the armies of Heaven, and among the inhabiters of the earth, on whom the lives of all men depend, that the founder of this hou&s;e had been continued to have &s;een the utmo&s;t of his de&s;ires compleated, in regard to this in&s;titution, and to have him&s;elf &s;poken to us on this occa&s;ion, with what plea&s;ure &s;hould I have attended, and, I believe I may add, with what plea&s;ure would mo&s;t of you have attended to the words in &s;ea&s;on, which no doubt he would have delivered with his u&s;ual energy on this &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;upreme di&s;po&s;er of all human events hath &s;een fit to order it otherwi&s;e, and in this providence &s;peaketh unto us as he did unto <HI>Peter</HI> on another oc|ca&s;ion:
<PB N="11" REF="012034_0010_0F8971AEBB8463A0">
What I do, thou knowe&s;t not now, but thou &s;halt know hereafter, as tho' he &s;aid, if thou art waiting upon me in the ways of my appointment, and depend|ing upon my divine teaching, tho' thou &s;ee&s;t not the rea&s;on of my actions, and knowe&s;t not NOW what I do, that is, the rea&s;on of my &s;o doing, thou &s;halt know it hereafter, when thy faith is &s;wallowed up in enjoyment, thy hope turned into fruition, and thy love made per|fect in the kingdom of my glory; then, and not before, thou &s;halt &s;ee that all my proceedings with the children of men were ordered for the be&s;t, and &s;o as to &s;ecure my glory and their good.</P>
<P>IT is therefore our duty to &s;ubmit and acquie&s;ce in the will of God, and we &s;hall find le&s;s difficulty in &s;o doing, if, with an eminent Divine,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Doctor Pemberton's &s;ermon, page 22.</NOTE> in his funeral &s;er|mon for our decea&s;ed friend, we con&s;ider, that, though <Q>&s;eparated from the &s;ociety of his friends below, he is united to the nobler &s;ociety above of Angels and Archangels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made per|fect.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WE view him there, not as peri&s;hing in the du&s;t of death, but as entered into a world of glory. We behold him wor&s;hipping before the throne of God, not with a company of frail imperfect mortals, but with the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born, &s;hining in the un&s;potted robes of holine&s;s, u|niting in ho&s;annahs and partaking of their re&s;pective triumphs.</Q> Our lo&s;s therefore is his eternal gain, and, glory be to our good God, if we are of the number of his faithful &s;ervants, there is the &s;ame eternal inheri|tance, the &s;ame glorious crown before us; after the&s;e we are a&s;piring, and, if we are pre&s;erved faithful a little longer, the day of death will come, (that happy

day to the real believer, that woeful, dreadful day to the men of this world) and put us in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; then, with our decea&s;ed friend, we &s;hall meet around the throne, and join with Cherubims and Sera|phims, and the whole Hierarchy of Heaven, in a&s;crib|ing &s;alvation, OUR &s;alvation, to God and the Lamb for evermore.</P>
<P>I HAVE cho&s;en, on this occa&s;ion, the words I have read to you, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure explained, and hope they are not altogether un&s;uitable to our pre&s;ent meet|ing, as they &s;trongly <HI>imply</HI> the duty of a&s;&s;embling our|&s;elves together for the wor&s;hip of God, and more &s;trong|ly <HI>expre&s;s</HI> the advantages we may expect and derive there|from.&mdash;Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them.</P>
<P>IN this order I intend to di&s;cour&s;e upon them, and to draw &s;ome &s;uitable inferences, and may the &s;pirit of God help both you and me to make a proper improve|ment of the whole.</P>
<P>MAN, at fir&s;t created, and &s;till pre&s;erved by him, who is the maker of all things, both in Heaven and earth, e|ven by that God in whom we live, move, and have our being, is under the &s;tronge&s;t obligation to pay him ho|mage and adoration. It is a principle &s;o deeply rooted in man's rea&s;on and con&s;cience, that, of all the nations of the earth, few, if any, but what have had &s;ome me|thod of te&s;tifying their belief of a &s;upreme being, and have invented &s;omething, which they have made their God; to which they have paid &s;ome kind of honour and wor&s;hip. But to us, who are under the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation; God has &s;o clearly revealed his mind and will, that we &s;hall be left entirely without excu&s;e, if we do not give him the glory due unto his name; a duty incumbent on us to perform, not only in private,
<PB N="13" REF="012034_0012_0F8971B036AE3EC8">
and in our families, in our morning and evening &s;acri|fices of devotion, but al&s;o publickly in tho&s;e places that are peculiarly &s;et apart for his wor&s;hip and &s;ervice; there we are to a&s;&s;emble and meet together to offer up our joint prayers and &s;upplications, and to hear his word read and preached by his &s;ervants, his mini&s;ters, for our mutual edification and comfort.</P>
<P>AND this, if we are really and truly Chri&s;tians, we &s;hall e&s;teem our highe&s;t honour, our greate&s;t privilege; for we &s;hall then, if we are &s;uch, attend the&s;e publick ordinances for religious wor&s;hip, not out of form and cu&s;tom, as is the ca&s;e with too too many&mdash;not merely for an example to others, but to meet our God in them&mdash;to enjoy in his hou&s;e communion with him, who&s;e pre&s;ence is better than life&mdash;to hear what God the Lord will &s;peak concerning us, who &s;peaks to his people, and to his &s;aints, that they return not to folly.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons churches, chapels, and publick edifices, are erected, that we may decently and conve|niently wor&s;hip God in publick congregation; but &s;orry am I to &s;ee they are, in general, &s;o little frequented. Tho' our duty to God, and the laws of our country, enjoin our attendance, many never enter the in&s;ide of a church, and with what reluctance do others formally attend now and then? They &s;eem as it were to drag their bodies only thither, and leave their &s;ouls behind them. Others &s;leep away the time, while others, who can hardly keep their eyes open, &s;hew, by their coun|tenance, how agreeably they are entertained; were you to judge others by their behaviour, you would &s;uppo&s;e them at &s;ome publick place of diver&s;ion by their light|ne&s;s and indecent carriage: Few, very few, &s;eem to be actuated by proper motives, and behave like tho&s;e who under&s;tand the important bu&s;ine&s;s they are engaged in. And all the while, they think them&s;elves very good

Chri&s;tians, and would be greatly offended to be thought otherwi&s;e. But is not &s;uch a conduct a &s;hame to Chri&s;ti|anity? The name without the thing will be of no &s;er|vice to you; away with &s;uch Chri&s;tianity from the earth. Our Chri&s;tianity, our religion, is not worth any thing, if it does not influence the whole man, make us wi&s;er and better, and regulate our whole lives and conver&s;a|tions. Renounce your profe&s;&s;ion, or live agreeably to it.&mdash;For God's, for your &s;oul's &s;ake, live as Chri&s;tians, or el&s;e you di&s;own Chri&s;tianity. The name without the thing will but aggravate your condemnation.</P>
<P>AS publick wor&s;hip is the duty of all who are called Chri&s;tians, therefore let us, if we are really as well as nominally &s;o, not for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling our&s;elves to|gether for divine wor&s;hip, as the manner of &s;ome is, who thereby not only neglect their duty, but de&s;pi&s;e their privilege.</P>
<P>LET &s;uch as are real believers exhort one another to a due and con&s;tant attendance upon publick wor&s;hip, and to wait upon God with a proper and &s;uitable frame and temper of mind, and &s;o much the more, as we &s;ee the day, the day of death approaching, which will put a final end to all our wor&s;hip upon earth, on the due improve|ment of which depends our wor&s;hipping with the church triumphant in Heaven. Be&s;ide&mdash;what great en|couragement does the promi&s;e in our text afford us to meet in the name of our adorable Redeemer, when he tells us, where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them. He is graci|ou&s;ly pre&s;ent with his faithful wor&s;hippers to quicken and enliven their devotion; then with joy they draw wa|ter out of the wells of &s;alvation, their language is, <Q>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, &s;o longeth my &s;oul after thee, O God. My &s;oul thir&s;teth for God, for the living God, when &s;hall I come and ap|pear

O how amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of Ho&s;ts, my &s;oul longeth, yea even faint|eth for the courts of the Lord, my heart and my fle&s;h crieth out for the living God, ble&s;&s;ed are they that dwell in thy hou&s;e, they will be &s;till prai&s;ing thee, they go from &s;trength to &s;trength, every one of them in <HI>Zion</HI> appeareth before God. A day in thy courts is better than a thou&s;and. I had rather be a door|keeper in the hou&s;e of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedne&s;s. O Lord of Ho&s;ts, ble&s;&s;ed is the man that tru&s;teth in thee.</Q>&mdash;This is the heart and language of &s;piritual wor&s;hippers.&mdash;Such as wor|&s;hip God in &s;pirit and in truth have a joy in God through our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> a joy that a &s;tranger to the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings intermeddleth not with. They have a peace which the world cannot give, and, glory be to God, a peace which the world cannot take away. It is their Heaven upon earth to enjoy communion and fellow&s;hip with the Father of their &s;pirits in his &s;anctuary. It is Heaven begun in their &s;oul, when, with the eye of faith, they &s;ee him, who is invi&s;ible, pre&s;iding in their wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies; when <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is pre&s;ent with them by his &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit of God witne&s;&s;eth with their &s;pirits that they are his children, they then renew their &s;trength by waiting upon the Lord, they mount up with wings as eagles, they run and are not weary, they walk and are not faint. They anticipate the joys of the ble&s;&s;ed, and have a foreta&s;te in earne&s;t of that happine&s;s they will enjoy when they &s;hall join the hea|venly ho&s;t and &s;ing the &s;ong of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Lamb forever and ever.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid I infer, that, as it is our duty to attend on publick wor&s;hip, and God has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to conde&s;cend to encourage us there|to, by promi&s;ing to be with us to ble&s;s us, we ought to embrace every opportunity afforded us for this &s;a|cred

<P>AGAIN, as our Lord has promi&s;ed to be mercifully pre&s;ent where two or three are gathered together in his name, it is by no means improper to erect and rai&s;e &s;uitable and decent buildings to be &s;et apart peculiarly for his &s;ervice, not that there is any intrin&s;ick holine&s;s in the buildings, they are only relatively holy, &s;o far as they are made u&s;e of for God's wor&s;hip. It is not the walls that con&s;titute the church, however beautiful the &s;tructure, however highly ornamented, and richly deco|rated. The church, according to our 19th article, is defined to be a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure word of God is preached, and the &s;a|craments duly admini&s;tered according to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s ordi|nance, in all tho&s;e things that of nece&s;&s;ity are requi&s;ite to the &s;ame, and in our communion &s;ervice, the ble&s;&s;ed company of all faithful people, every member incorpo|rate in the my&s;tical body of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> heirs through hope of God's everla&s;ting kingdom, by the merits of the mo&s;t precious death and pa&s;&s;ion of his dear Son, are con&s;idered in holy fellow&s;hip.</P>

He is near to you in his ordinances, and if you call in earne&s;t upon him, he will hear you, and give an an&s;wer of peace. Take heed that you do not de&s;pi&s;e his calls and neglect his invitations, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;wear in his wrath concerning you, they &s;hall not enter into my re&s;t. Remember, Sirs, time is &s;hort, death is certain, the hour of your departure very uncertain; an eternity of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery depends upon your improving or mi&s;improving the few days al|lotted you. There is no repentance in the grave, to which we are all ha&s;tening. As the tree falleth, &s;o it mu&s;t lie; as the day of death leaves you, the day of

<P>IT is undoubtedly the indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation of e|very one entru&s;ted with the bu&s;ine&s;s of education to &s;a|tisfy the publick with re&s;pect to their abilities and inten|tions, and therefore I hope to convince you that no pains will be &s;pared, no time lo&s;t, that whatever is u&s;e|ful in the &s;ciences, or ornamental in life, will <HI>here</HI> be inculcated both by precept and example.&mdash;Authors in the &s;everal branches of knowledge will be regularly read, and the &s;acred &s;criptures con&s;tantly explained:&mdash;The&s;e can be&s;tow under&s;tanding upon all men; they are the univer&s;al logick, &s;ince none can read them without ei|ther acquiring a greater exactne&s;s of thought, or being invited to contract a greater rectitude of manners.</P>
<P>OUR time being &s;o far elap&s;ed, permit me, in the be|half of the&s;e poor Orphans, and in the name of every member concerned in this Seminary, mo&s;t heartily to thank your Excellency, and all the Gentlemen and La|dies now before me, for their kind attendance on this &s;olemnity. With &s;entiments of the mo&s;t unfeigned gra|titude we would expre&s;s our &s;en&s;e of it, and hope for the continuance of their e&s;teem and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="012034_0028_0F8971BCF5D15030">
AND I &s;hould be greatly wanting in re&s;pect and duty to you, Reverend Sir, and indeed ju&s;tly incur the di&s;|plea&s;ure of all concerned in the management of this in|&s;titution, if I did not now embrace the opportunity of returning you their and my humble&s;t thanks for your kind and friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>MAY what you and others have done on this Anni|ver&s;ary terminate in the glory of the great Head of the Church, who is God over all ble&s;&s;ed for evermore.</P>
