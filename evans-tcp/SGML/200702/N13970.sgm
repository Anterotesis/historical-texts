<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I AM</HI> not going to a&s;cribe to you a miracle. I renounce enthu&s;ia&s;m, and think too highly of your under&s;tanding to in&s;ult it by flattery. But, &s;o far as <HI>&s;econd</HI> cau&s;es may be nece&s;&s;ary to fulfil the fiat of the fir&s;t, in the government of human affairs, I do, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, believe, you were the means of &s;aving me, in the &s;ummer of <HI>1779</HI> from death.</P>
<P>Prior to the event which procured me the benefit of your advice, it had been my chief plea&s;ure to compo&s;e the volumes which now ap|proach you. Struck by an uncommon tenderne&s;s in the circum&s;tances, whereon the work is founded, I wi&s;hed earne&s;tly for health to fini&s;h what might prove a &s;ource of virtuous entertainment. Not that I laid any &s;tre&s;s on my <HI>own</HI> effort towards it, but becau&s;e the facts were pre|eminently beautiful in <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> and courted every addition of fancy, with every embelli&s;hment of the heart. I recovered. Emma Corbett was concluded. The incidents, without the lea&s;t literary adornment, take a &s;trong hold of the feelings; and, probably, will owe more to their &s;implicity and native <HI>TRUTH,</HI> than if, by a more elaborate effort, I had robbed them of this <HI>genuine</HI> advantage.</P>
<P><HI>The tear of Sen&s;ibility</HI> is at once the &s;ofte&s;t and be&s;t evidence of the prai&s;e which it is my ambition to merit on this occa&s;ion: and if it be my lot to enjoy this honour, you cannot be ignorant of the means by which it has been conferred. Notwith&s;tanding this, every thing, which tends to &s;hew the world how entirely your <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> prevailed over your <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> will, I know, be interdicted, I comply therefore, Sir, with the pro&s;criptions of delicacy, though I am thereby deprived of doing ju&s;tice: and with whatever difficulty I repre&s;s the current of my gratitude; only re&s;erving to my&s;elf the plea&s;ure to declare publicly, how much I am, Sir,</P>

&s;acred; but the very &s;ame principles compel me to forfeit even <HI>your</HI> affection, Sir, if it is to be pre&s;erved at the price of my duty. We, unfortunately, happen to &s;ee the American di&s;pute in oppo&s;ite lights. It is &s;ufficient to a &s;oldier that he believes his quarrel to be ju&s;t. You arraign my humanly. Wherefore? I retort not the accu&s;ation. May we not con&s;ider a public conte&s;t in different points of view, and yet be friends? Both may act from feeling&punc; and both on principle. You imagine America is aggrieved, while I look upon <HI>her</HI> at the aggre&s;&s;or. What of that? Do we interfere with the opinions of each other? I was not acce&s;&s;ary to the death of your &s;on; and had it been my fate to meet him in the field, I can conceive the point on which nature would have in&s;i&s;ted. She would gracefully have led us both a little from the line of duty, and &s;pared one in &s;ympathy to the other N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, more. Had I &s;een the &s;word tremble at his bo&s;om, my own &s;hould for that moment have been as a &s;hield, and you know not <HI>how</HI> far I would have ventured for the brother of Emma. But as to the commi&s;&s;ion, O be a&s;&s;ured, I did not &s;olicit it till I had well reflected on every con&s;equence, pro|bable and po&s;&s;ible, of obtaining it. It <HI>is</HI> obtained, and I rejoice; nor could it be re&s;igned to purcha&s;e a diadem, with Emma on a throne to wear it. Change &s;ides! No, Sir; if the&s;e are to be the terms, take back the hand you <HI>permitted</HI> me to win, and po&s;&s;e&s;s, undivided, her fortune and your own. You have not looked ac|curately at my &s;oul. As I am not, on the one hand, &s;o <HI>&s;en&s;ual,</HI> to gratify my pa&s;&s;ion at the expence of the holy faith and the &s;olemn &s;ervices which I have &s;worn to my country; &s;o neither am I &s;o <HI>&s;or|did</HI> on the other, as to court her inheritance without many endea|vours, con&s;i&s;tent with the powers of my youth, to add &s;omething to her fortune. Patrimony hath dropt from my hope, but nature may, perhaps, have be&s;towed the equivalent. The arts of war, ra|ther than tho&s;e of peace, &s;eem, at this conjuncture, to lay the &s;tronge&s;t claim to the genius of a young Engli&s;hman; and I have no notion of that indolence which can be content to fall into the arms of beauty and pro&s;perity, without a &s;ingle effort to de&s;erve them. If, Sir, I have any tender intere&s;t in the heart of Emma, as I think I have, it has been more generou&s;ly fought. But why do I argue with &s;o much gravity, when perhaps you intend all this in the way of trial: willing to &s;ee if my attachment to my native country was not le&s;s than my pa&s;&s;ion for my mi&s;tre&s;s. Yes, yes, this is your experiment. You wanted to know whether it was ap|petite or affection that influenced me in regard to your daughter, and you will not, I tru&s;t, be di&s;plea&s;ed to find the ba&s;is as &s;olid as your friend&s;hip or &s;olicitude might de&s;ire.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t add to this letter a few after ob&s;ervations, which a re|peru&s;al of it has given birth to.

<P>THE delightful letter of my charming Emma is lying in my bo&s;om, as I take up the pen to reply.

It is not the full foliage of the laurel, but it is the little unobtru&s;ive leaf of gratitude and love.</P>
<P>Yet mu&s;t I not, and ought I not to tremble while I prai&s;e? O, this America, my Henry! The&s;e chances of war!

The <HI>future</HI> is a wide &s;pace, and may contain within its circle a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings. Struggle then again&s;t the &s;torm bravely. Your inferences are too gloomy: various opportunities will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffer, doubt not, to &s;peed our generous intercour&s;e. The wide world of &s;enti|ment and &s;en&s;ation &s;till opens upon us. By aid of this little friend|ly in&s;trument, we may range through tho&s;e paths which ocean &s;eems to &s;eparate. However remote, you &s;hould &s;till learn to think i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;uperior ble&s;&s;ing, that, in &s;ome part of animated nature, there &s;till exi&s;ts the counterpart of Emma&mdash;congenial as dear; &mdash;one, when no circum&s;tance can change, but who mu&s;t ever remain true to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry touch of joy, and every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">embling of woe. Look, Emma, at the paltry pa&s;&s;ions, and vulgar gratifications of common life&mdash; of common lovers. Look attentively at the&s;e, and then examine your own heart&mdash;examine mine. Con&s;ider the pure nature of the affection that unites them. Does not the &s;uperiority of our attach|ment make you generou&s;ly proud? O Emma! you ought not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wretched. We have both rea&s;on to be content.</P>

period, when I wrote tho&s;e ha&s;ty lines which you have honoured with mo&s;t dear prai&s;e. In &s;triking the balance then, let us not complain, my friend; but when fretting at di&s;appointment, or drooping under the languors of di&s;tre&s;s, let us &s;upport our&s;elves with the a&s;&s;urance, that the rich current will return after all ob|&s;tructions, and flow &s;weetly and &s;moothly along its proper chan|nels.

<P>Ah! what is there &s;o likely to melt the &s;pirit of a &s;oldier into cowardice, as the tears of Emma? She will not then give way to the tender torrent. She will court the balmy ble&s;&s;ings of ea&s;e and hope. She will check the&s;e convul&s;ive tran&s;ports of di&s;tre&s;s&punc; &s;o de&s;tructive to my honour, and her own health.

<P>YOU have found then, it &s;eems, Loui&s;a's billet, making the offer of her hou&s;e this evening to Emma and to Henry. By what chance the note dropt I am ignorant. The hand of agitation is not, indeed, &s;teady; nor can the agonized heart guard again&s;t common chances. I am not &s;orry that the paper, by whatever means, has got into <HI>your</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, oh, my dear father! It takes &s;ome part of the load from my bo&s;om; for I am hurt to appear plotting that, which will &s;o thoroughly bear explanation. You de&s;ire Mr. Hammond to vi&s;it me no more. He obeys. You reque&s;t that I would, without enquiring into rea&s;ons, forbear to &s;peak of him to you. I am obedient. You de&s;ired that my utmo&s;t intere&s;t might be tried, to keep him from America. O, you can conjecture how <HI>readily,</HI> and, as you know Henry's darling pa&s;&s;ion, you may gue&s;s how <HI>vainly,</HI> I undertook this. The double plea&s;ure of obli|ging you, my father, and of gratifying my own fond heart, pre|vailed with me to urge this point, till I had well nigh turned his affection to di&s;gu&s;t You bid me cea&s;e to love, and with the utmo&s;t ingenuou&s;ne&s;s I tell you it is impo&s;&s;ible &mdash; Impo&s;&s;ible, my dear father, becau&s;e repugnant to every principle by which all the actions of my life have been governed.</P>
<P>My regard &mdash; oh! that is too cold a word &mdash; my <HI>love,</HI> for Henry, is not, you know, the &s;tart of a moment, the romantic &s;ally of a warm temper, nor the effect of that &s;illy admiration, which pays down the tribute of folly to the charms of a red coat. I &s;ecretly grieve that the profe&s;&s;ion of arms &s;hould have been cho&s;en: I have &s;hed too many tears to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mory of my <HI>brother,</HI> to be in love with regimentals: but my tenderne&s;s was antecedent to all the&s;e misfor|tunes; nor will it be in the power of any misfortune to dimini&s;h what your judgement, and the eloquence of my own heart, have &s;o long approved. Your pre&s;ent avowed di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t Mr. Ham|mond is &s;udden; but &s;ettled affection cannot readily accomodate it&s;elf to &s;uch revolutions. What is rooted in nature cannot, with|out much labour, be eradicated by art. As it di&s;plea&s;es you, Sir, I am concerned at this. But &s;hall I deceive, in order to make my peace? &s;hall I be <HI>unnatural,</HI> in order to be <HI>filial?</HI> Shall I propen&s;ely &s;et one great duty again&s;t another, and &s;o de&s;troy the excellence of
<PB N="19" REF="017678_0019_0FA21F1786FD8148">
both? No. You would hate me for it, and I &s;hould hate my&s;elf. That I am in this bitter period, when I am about to lo&s;e what you your&s;elf &s;o lately thought mo&s;t precious, able to write with &s;o much argumentative compo&s;ure, is, alas! no &s;ign of my indifference, but an in&s;tance &mdash; perhaps the &s;tronge&s;t that could be given &mdash; of that &s;teady attachment, which, born of honour, is nouri&s;hed by virtue. To be <HI>attached,</HI> is the dictate of nature. To be attached to a man of <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>morals,</HI> is the dictate of delicacy; and the &s;ymptom, I conceive, of a good di&s;po&s;ition. Such, my mo&s;t honoured father, were the elementary rules I caught from you. Would you controvert your own maxims? Or, while the merit of the object increa&s;es, is it a fit time to withdraw from it the love, which nature and common &s;en&s;e &s;eem to &s;ay &s;hould increa&s;e in proportion?</P>
<P>But you depend, I find, on the lenitives of ab&s;ence, and of time. I will not an&s;wer for the vigour of my own mind, for I know the frail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of our nature. If it is &s;oothing to my father to count upon what the&s;e things <HI>may</HI> do, let me not de&s;troy his &s;ource of ex|pectation. I am not, thanks to <HI>his</HI> corrected culture, enough the giddy girl to bur&s;t forth into a&s;&s;everations of <HI>con&s;tancy everla&s;ting,</HI> merely to vex a parent by <HI>&s;etting my heart</HI> again&s;t his wi&s;hes: I would de&s;ire rather to di&s;tru&s;t my own temper; and, laying my af|fections open to his view, beg him to form his judgment upon a &s;ur|vey of them.&mdash;But I dare not mi&s;lead one who hath &s;o entire a right to be treated frankly. I make no vows; yet, in proportion as an attach|ment is deliberate, is it not fixed and permanent? And this being my fir&s;t and only affection, (having be&s;ides a man of unblemi&s;hed character and congenial manners for its object) have I not a right &s;trongly to &s;u&s;pect&mdash;But enjoy the opinion you &s;o &s;trongly adopt. Ble&s;s you, my father, for the gentlene&s;s of your inhibitions. You do not threaten &mdash; You do not rave. The&s;e might have augmented my di&s;tre&s;s, but could not have abated my affection. A circum|&s;tance of which parents &s;eem &s;o uncon&s;cious, that they de&s;troy the effect of authority by the vehemence with which they exert it. They confu&s;e, but do not convince: terrify, but do not conciliate; and almo&s;t ju&s;tify di&s;obedience, by their manner of enforcing duty.</P>
<P>Oh Heaven! the clock is &s;triking &mdash;the hour is come &mdash; the mi|nute&mdash; the moment is approaching. I will ring for a &s;ervant to take this into the parlour. My feet will &s;carcely carry me down &s;tairs. An ingenuous nature appeals to you for pity, Sir &mdash; will you refu&s;e?

<P>O HOW tenderly you have &s;poken to a brother's feelings, my beautiful &s;i&s;ter!

<P>WHAT a return have you made for the trifle I &s;ent you, O, mo&s;t dear and ingenious friend I ever directing the current of that rich &s;tream (which knows no diminution, but &s;catters fer|tility and fragrance as it flows) to comfort, to amu&s;e, or to in&s;truct me&punc; How I rejoice, that the bagatelle plea&s;ed you. It was my fir&s;t intention to have the hair di&s;po&s;ed into an ornament for the &s;hirt, but I con&s;idered the nature of that delicate &s;entiment you feel for Emma. I reflected that it was <HI>retired,</HI> that it &s;hunned every thing obtru&s;ive, that it could ill brook the idle, and perhaps the wanton curio&s;ity of tho&s;e cockaded heroes, who imagine tenderne&s;s incompatible with bravery. On the&s;e accounts, therefore, I cho&s;e to &s;uit my locket to <HI>that</HI> &s;ituation only in which your delicate par|tiality would be mo&s;t likely to place it.</P>
<P>Round your neck, my dear Henry, let it ever hang, impervious to every eye but that of the proprietor. &mdash; A &s;acred cali&s;man may it prove &mdash; a &s;oft &s;hield thrown over your bo&s;om by the trembling hand of a friend! &mdash;O, that I could breathe upon it all the virtues that were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t benevolent geoii &mdash; that it had &s;trength of charm &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve you as &s;ecurely from &s;ickne&s;s, &s;orrow, and mi&s;chance, &mdash; from the bullet and the &s;word, &mdash; as I do firmly believe the &s;ight and touch of it will arm your heart again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion of every error, and the practice of every irregularity.</P>
<P>Your letter, with its fair and tuneful inclo&s;ure, found me upon my pillow, from which I ha&s;tened with a rapidity which is the &s;pontaneous impul&s;e of unaffected tenderne&s;s. Like a much-wi&s;hed-fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and much-wanted cordial&punc; it found me in an affecting moment.

<L>"Like the &s;weet breezes of the South,</L>

Oh, Henry, my heart dilates as I write and the &s;oft drops de&s;cend in a pathetic and &s;weet a&s;&s;urance of our future felicity; but do not be unea&s;y that I weep,&mdash;&s;uch tears will not hurt me. They are pre|cious drops that invigorate virtue, and fre&s;hen as they fall.

Carry the remembrance of &s;uch intercour&s;e over the world of waters. Call to mind the time when our lengthened at|tention to the moral page, in&s;tead of relaxing, grew &s;tronger and more fixed; when our under&s;tandings and our hearts &s;eemed equally to refine and to expand!</P>
<P>Yes, Henry, I will try to adopt that gentle &s;pirit of prophecy, which breathes &s;o beautiful an ardour over your con&s;olatory pages. I do not <HI>expect</HI> to gather the bloom of the ro&s;e, without feeling the puncture of the &s;urrounding thorn. I gratefully take it with all its little wounding appendages&mdash;I place it in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>&mdash;I have promi&s;ed not to repine: yet, if a gentle murmur &s;ome|times e&s;capes, let me, I prithee, find indulgence for it, and do not chide me; oh, how often have I wi&s;hed &s;ince your departure, to be the companion of your voyage and all its con&s;equences, how|ever multiplied, however menacing! And, after all, Henry, your &s;ituation is more tolerable than mine: the travelling friend has the advantage of tho&s;e who are left, in &s;olitude, behind. The very velocity of the motion is favourable: in pa&s;&s;ing rapidly along, the fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, and the change of objects, engage and divert the mind in&s;en&s;ibly; while the poor forlorn one, that remains fixed to the former &s;pot, has only to mark the pre&s;ent period, to look in vain around for what is lo&s;t, to ca&s;t a "longing, lingering eye" upon the pa&s;t, and, in the torture of reflection, to confe&s;s that &s;uch things <HI>were,</HI>&mdash;but <HI>are,</HI> alas! no more.</P>
<P>It has been my fortune to pa&s;s thro' the &s;treet where you re&s;ided, more than once &s;ince your departure. O, think with what emotions I viewed tho&s;e windows which belonged to an apartment &s;o lately your's! The &s;ight of your <HI>grave</HI> could &s;carcely have produced any thing more affecting: and yet I feel that I &s;hall like to pa&s;s often by them. I do not pretend to <HI>account</HI> for the&s;e little touches, I only &s;imply <HI>relate</HI> them. Will not your feeling nature ea&s;ily explain them?</P>
<P>And now confe&s;s, Hammond, that I have arrived at the due degree of heroi&s;m: confe&s;s, that I am &s;ufficiently <HI>&s;oldier'd</HI>; for I can hold the pen, and impre&s;s the quiet-&s;eeming &s;entiment, with my eyes full of tears&punc; and my heart full of &s;orrow. What more can you expect from female philo&s;ophy? What more can you expect from a friend who has been u&s;ed to regret the ab&s;ence of an hour as a misfortune?</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;end off this, on the &s;light chance of its reaching you. If

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. TO F. BERKLEY, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FREDERICK, he is &s;et off; but I have no rea&s;on to imagine his embarkation a good omen. As far as the <HI>father's</HI> intere&s;t goes, I am &s;afe, but <HI>that</HI> does not go very far. To tell you the truth, I am <HI>my&s;elf</HI> &s;omewhat an odd kind of a fellow in this re|&s;pect. I &s;hould not choo&s;e to accept an alienated or reluctant hand. Nor could I &s;it quiet under the idea of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a woman, who gave her per&s;on as an equivalent for a title and a fortune. The&s;e niceties, you will &s;ay, are, at my age, &s;omewhat <HI>out of date</HI>; and I ought not to <HI>expect</HI> &s;uch etiquettes will be attended to by a fine young woman, whom, perhaps, you imagine, I might jump at on <HI>any</HI> terms. Look'y' Frederick, leave me to &s;ettle my own &s;ingu|larities, and do you &s;ettle your's. I think fit, for old acquaintance &s;ake, to unbo&s;om to you a very fooli&s;h &s;ecret. The lea&s;t you can do is to hear my &s;tory, and to let me tell it my own way. I am now in love "<HI>nolens volens.</HI>" You may laugh, but I <HI>feel</HI> it is not in my power to extricate my&s;elf. Would the wench had not fallen in my way! <HI>The&s;e</HI> are what I call cro&s;s incidents. When a man is jogging on, and has got &s;oberly to the re&s;ting place, <HI>then</HI> to have a &s;lap on the &s;houlder from &s;uch an urchin as Cupid, <HI>then</HI> to be attacked bow and arrow in hand&mdash;Is not this too bad&mdash;Is not this too ridiculous&mdash;too humiliating?</P>
<P>After you have uttered the &s;arca&s;tic <HI>yes,</HI> I &s;hall proceed to ac|quaint you, that this mighty ridiculous thing is the mo&s;t <HI>&s;erious tor|ment</HI>: and what renders it the more perplexing is, that, old fellow as I am, it is a circum&s;tance wholly <HI>new</HI> to me&mdash;not more &s;o to the verie&s;t &s;tripling when he wafts from him the maiden &s;ighs for a tripping chit of fifteen. I am not in my dotage, <HI>am</HI> I, Berkley, at forty-three? No, hang it; that is not what they call being well-&s;tricken&mdash;<HI>is</HI> it? I have &s;ome terms to keep with <HI>my&s;elf</HI> too. I &s;hould not <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to be <HI>too</HI> ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>But this young adventurer! This happy hero! The parts of his character that I have been able to pick up&mdash;&s;uch as health, agreeablene&s;s, genius, &s;pirit, courage, and animation, are not ab&s;olutely in my favour, are they, Frederick?</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee what <HI>I</HI> have got to put in the balance <HI>again&s;t</HI> them. &mdash; the gout&mdash; &s;mall-pox pits&mdash;not the ninetieth part of a mu&s;e&mdash;le&s;s courage than caution, and &s;pirits &s;omewhat harra&s;&s;ed out in the real wear and tear of worldly events. I don't like it, Frederick.&mdash; It won't do. My lighter &s;cale is hurled aloof, and I am bouncing my head again&s;t the beam mo&s;t abominably. O Frederick!</P>
<P>Is there, then, nothing to throw in by way of bringing a middle aged gentleman on the equilibrium?

<HEAD>Letter XXXV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I SAID I would tell you how we deceive our&s;elves. I will. The <HI>&s;lender circum&s;tances,</HI> and even the <HI>great misfortunes</HI> of a lover, are no kind of objection in the eyes of a <HI>&s;entimental mi&s;tre&s;s</HI>; em|barra&s;&s;ments of the world call forth the &s;iner &s;entiments, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e excite &s;ympathy. Now <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> Frederick, is, in the female brea&s;t, a very tender &s;en&s;ation. It is a &s;trange thing, but a true, that this &s;ame adorable SENTIMENT has ever had (with indeed very few exceptions) a mo&s;t &s;ore quarrel with &s;olid &s;ilver and gold; and with the coin current of a country. In the account of young <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> women (who are the greate&s;t wor&s;hippers of the fair idol) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t really circulates as mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t <HI>&s;terling</HI>; and the prevailing charms of a pathetic, poetical poverty is a more welcome draft to them, than any which mere <HI>matter-of fact wealth</HI> could draw upon his banker. Thus it is, that fathers &s;acrifice to Plutus, and children (e&s;pecially daugh|ters) to a beggarly Deity, whom Plutus laughs to &s;corn: and hence the &s;ource of ten thou&s;and family feuds &mdash; hence the ri&s;e of &s;eparate maintenance; and the fall of dome&s;tic confidence. Sentimental Love is torn almo&s;t to ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers in his way to the altar; and when, in this effort, his robe is <HI>mo&s;t</HI> ragged, <HI>then</HI> is his gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry the <HI>mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI>; for thus b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ggarly as he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he &s;hall laugh at the labours of a <HI>rich</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, and as he pa&s;&s;es, poverty-&s;truck (as it &s;hould &s;eem) through files of females, he will flaunt his famine in your face, and <HI>&s;entimentally</HI> tell you, it is his <HI>letter of recommenda|tion.</HI> And all this, Frederick, while plain affection (in a &s;nuff-coloured coat for in&s;tance) throws in <HI>vain</HI> the ma&s;&s;y money bag, acro&s;s his &s;houlders, and &s;eeks Hymen's temple by the path that is obvious and unentangled. Now a days, the broad highway is de|&s;erted; and the women rather <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to &s;tick tho&s;e ro&s;es in their bo&s;om that are encompa&s;&s;ed by <HI>thorns,</HI> than accept the riche&s;t <HI>bouquet,</HI> in the garden that lies open to the view, ready to the hand, and that may be collected without any difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Difficulty!</HI> there it is again. That is <HI>another</HI> cur&s;ed thing which enters into the &s;pirit of a modern attachment! It is the fir&s;t cou&s;in of &s;entiment, or, as I have heard, its parent. A &s;ly old neighbour of mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, who has look'd &s;hrewdly and &s;ilently at human nature, and whom I, &s;ometimes, u&s;ed to con&s;ult on that &s;ubject, tells me, that <HI>difficulty</HI> is the happie&s;t thing in the world to &s;entimental lovers. I
<PB N="34" REF="017678_0034_0FA21F255B8787F8">
hinted to my friend in reply to this, that <HI>I</HI> then might con&s;ider my age, my dark complexion, my wig, and my fair round body, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;o many points in my <HI>favour,</HI> &s;ince they would, no doubt, throw a re&s;pectable quantity of the afore&s;aid <HI>difficulty</HI> in the way of my <HI>wi&s;hes,</HI> meaning my overtures to Emma Corbett. Aye, quoth my friend&mdash;but they are not the right <HI>&s;ort</HI> of difficulties.

Of the <HI>latter,</HI> you, Sir Robert, to my recollection, have not one: for you are too rich to experi|ence an objection on the &s;ide of ca&s;h, which, by incurring the con|tempt of the father, might po&s;&s;ibly recommend you to the child &mdash; You are too &s;leek and too plump, to make a young lady mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">take your countenance for the &s;eat of &s;entiment, and there is &s;o terrible an air of <HI>plenty</HI> all over you, that you are, in my opinion, an un|wi&s;e Baronet to addre&s;s any thing but one of tho&s;e <HI>prudent</HI> young ladies, which, in a matrimonial bargain, cling to the <HI>&s;olid</HI> com|forts, and will not like you the <HI>wor&s;e</HI> for being &s;o abundantly pro|vided with the goods of this life &mdash; But to attempt a woman of <HI>&s;en|timent,</HI> an ATTACHED woman of &s;entiment, the mi&s;tre&s;s of a young <HI>&s;oldier,</HI> who loves a man of <HI>poverty</HI> &mdash; a man of <HI>poetry</HI> &mdash; and, to crown all, who loves a man that is not the <HI>pre&s;ent choice of her fa|ther</HI>&mdash; Alas, poor Sir Robert! you may think your&s;elf well off, if &s;he does not conceive towards you, a generous kind of aver&s;ion, and order you to a&s;&s;ume a genteel &s;ize, to wear your own hair, and to adopt the melting mood before &s;he &s;uffers a &s;econd vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Thus &s;pake my friend&mdash;and I don't know what to think of his doctrine Give her up, I po&s;itively cannot &mdash; Gain her is not a lit|tle improbable. Yet I have met her &s;everal times &s;ince my arrival, and &s;he has not yet ordered me to a&s;&s;ume a genteel &s;ize, nor to wear my own hair. I de&s;ign to make &s;ome little alterations in the <HI>head|way,</HI> 'tis true, but this is more in frolic than &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s: for I love to adopt little drolleries. They belong to my temper, and have accompanied me to a very good end, through life&mdash;which, I really find, requires many little lifts to go plea&s;antly through.</P>
<P>It is on this account, Frederick, that I regret having &s;een the fair Emma Corbett. My partiality is not, I find, &s;uch a one as I can accomodate to my old habit of quaint jocularity. It has a little jarred the harmony of my little &s;y&s;tem already, I do not enjoy the pa&s;&s;ing &s;cene quite &s;o care-free&mdash;and why &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d I di&s;gui&s;e any thing from Frederick Berkley?&mdash; I feel an earne&s;t de&s;ire to touch the <HI>heart</HI> of this girl <HI>&s;o,</HI> that I &s;hould be as nece&s;&s;ary to her felicity as &s;he is to mine; and the fear of not being able to accompli&s;h this makes me, at times, mo&s;t peculiarly mi&s;erable.

<P>I am not by any means &s;o rich as I was at your departure from this country for India: yet I am too rich&mdash; and &s;hould think my&s;elf &s;o had I only one guinea upon the earth&mdash; to marry Emma to <HI>your</HI> fortune to mend <HI>mine.</HI> I did love Hammond, even with a father's love, and in a legal &s;en&s;e to <HI>be</HI> his father was my favourite inten|tion.

The hou&s;e of a very <HI>old friend</HI> of my father's, lately landed from India, is now our re&s;idence, and it was once the re&s;idence of Emma and of Henry; for it is that very <HI>Ca&s;tle|berry</HI> where my father (who has &s;ince &s;old it to the pre&s;ent proprietor) had u&s;ed to pa&s;s with his &s;elect friends, &s;ome months of every &s;ummer.

The agent fixed upon this &s;pot, and it became the &s;eat of Sir Robert before my father knew that it was to be inhabited by a friend. Sir Robert is delighted with the purcha&s;e, and my father re|joices to &s;ee a domain which he once loved, &s;o properly di&s;po&s;ed of. You al&s;o remember this retreat; for was you not the a&s;&s;ociate of our flowery infancy?&mdash; Loui&s;a and Edward, Henry and Emma, formed the dear, family circle.

<P>Sir Robert Raymond, our ho&s;t, is a br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d &s;et, brown faced, good-natured, very &s;en&s;ible man, with &s;ome, not di&s;greeable particu|larities; a large fortune, &s;ometime &s;ince bequeathed him, and no &s;ort of impertinence in con&s;equence of it. Humour, &s;erious &s;en&s;e, and ob&s;er|vation, divide his character. He was bred to phy&s;ic, and in the ear|lier part of his life practi&s;ed as a &s;ea &s;urgeon. He is full of anecdote, and extremely a&s;&s;iduous to animate conver&s;ation, without ingro&s;&s;ing it. <HI>I</HI> am particularly the object of his notice, chiefly, no doubt, becau&s;e he perceives I &s;tand mo&s;t in need of comfort; and I return his civilities as well as the &s;ituation of my heart will allow.</P>
<P>Yet, with re&s;pect to the country, I was &s;omewhat mi&s;taken, my friend.

<P>BE &s;o obliging as to tell me, whether it is madne&s;s, or dotage, to which I am now reduced? That it is one or the other, (pro|vided it be not a mixture of <HI>both</HI>) is now pa&s;t que&s;tion. I cannot &s;uf|fer Corbett to propo&s;e me to his daughter, nor have I the confidence to propo&s;e my&s;elf. And, indeed, the more frequently I conver&s;e with her (which I take all decent occa&s;ions of doing) the more I &s;ee her, hear her voice, and perceive the &s;en&s;e "di&s;tinct and clear" that is falling from her lips whenever &s;he opens them, the le&s;s I am able to &s;peak, nay the le&s;s a&s;&s;urance have I to believe, that &s;o much merit, youth, and beauty, will have any thing to &s;ay, &s;eriou&s;ly, to a fellow with &s;o &s;un-burnt a vi&s;age, and <HI>un&s;entimental</HI> a &s;et of fea|tures, as the middle-aged Robert Raymond.</P>
<P>She hath an affecting trick of &s;ighing bitterly, and of &s;hedding tears, which bur&s;t upon one &s;o unpreparedly, that, though I knew them to be the effu&s;ions of her friend&s;hip for the young volunteer, I could not find it in my heart to check them; but let a few of the &s;ame kind &s;teal down my <HI>own</HI> cheek in very <HI>fellow&s;hip of &s;ym|pathy.</HI> I &s;hould upon my word, I <HI>feel</HI> that I &s;hould, and I have not &s;ported with my emotions enough to di&s;gui&s;e them.</P>
<P>Yet I have never heard her mention the name of Hammond &s;ince her arrival at Ca&s;tleberry, from whence you &s;ee I am now da|ting. Is not this &s;trange? I always thought the tongue was a traitor upon the&s;e occa&s;ions. She LOOKS Hammond, methinks, but &s;he SPEAKS him not. I think I can interpret her eyes; but <HI>they</HI> are indeed the &s;eat of every fine &s;entiment, and &s;eem made to expre&s;s every thing that is gentle and tender, &s;o that it is no wonder. <HI>You,</HI> friend Frederick, are an adept in the&s;e matters.

I do really think I am engaged in a very unthri&s;ty undertaking&mdash;a looking-gla&s;s that happens to hang near the table on which I am now writing, confirms me in this opinion.

<P>I write, you &s;ee, in my old way, but I am put &s;orely out of my old road for all that.

<P>THERE is no &s;pecies of publication which &s;eems to be more agreeably received than that which illu&s;trates the characters of men di&s;tingui&s;hed for their abilities, venerable for their erudi|tion, and admired for their virtues. The political hi&s;tory of great men is u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to many; but the dome&s;tic hi&s;tory of all men is u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to all.</P>
<P>Among the materials from whence the biographer forms the vo|lume of dome&s;tic characters, private letters are con&s;idered as the mo&s;t valuable, becau&s;e they are the mo&s;t unequivocal authorities of real &s;entiment and opinion. Conver&s;ation is too fugitive to be remembered; public declarations may be oftentimes &s;u&s;pected; but the epi&s;tolary communications of friend&s;hip may be depended upon as faithful to the mind from whence they ari&s;e. The following letters, therefore, as proceeding from a Nobleman who&s;e great talents promi&s;ed no &s;mall utility to his country, and who&s;e character has been the &s;ubject of &s;uch general &s;peculation, will, without doubt, meet with a favourable reception.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. TO MRS. ARNOLD.</HEAD>
<P>BY a line ju&s;t received from Loui&s;a I am interdicted at pre&s;ent from writing to her, and the &s;entiments which now oppre&s;s me are indeed, on <HI>all</HI> accounts, improper to offer a mind pierced by &s;o &s;imilar a &s;orrow. Yet, to re&s;train the whole dreadful weight in my own bo&s;om would &s;urely kill me. Do <HI>you</HI> then, O my dear cou&s;in, my worthy Caroline, do <HI>you</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t me. &mdash; Tell me, I conjure you, where the feeling heart &s;hall find a &s;anctuary? Tell me, what foliage is thick and impenetrable enough to repel that terror which a&s;&s;ails an unhappy woman, when the object of every hope and every fear is determined upon dangers the mo&s;t complicated and deci&s;ive? Henry, your <HI>favourite</HI> Henry, is gone, you know, to defend his country, to &s;ignalize his bravery, and to &s;erve his King. I admit the propriety of the enterprize, according to the laws of <HI>honour,</HI> but I weep at the extremity of its horror when tried by the laws of <HI>feeling</HI> and <HI>humanity.</HI></P>
<P>The glowing arguments of that dear departed, I did not dare to oppo&s;e. I faintly breathed the female re&s;i&s;tance, I feared, le&s;t my affection might &s;eem to be &s;elfi&s;h, by conte&s;ting the point of &s;eparation. I violated the &s;oftne&s;s of my &s;ex, and the tenderne&s;s of my nature, to re&s;train the flowing tide that ro&s;e in billows to my heart, which laboured with the agony of &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. His being this moment upon the &s;ea, eager to gain the &s;eats of ho&s;tility, is a proof of it! Perhaps, I might have &s;educed him from this adventure, &s;ince humanity and love (oh, how oppo&s;ite from ravage and war!) are the principles which &s;hine the brighte&s;t in the &s;potle&s;s hi&s;tory of Henry's youth. But I dreaded the after operations of inexorable honour, which might dete&s;t the trembling hand that &s;aved it from the &s;word.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>now,</HI> my Caroline, <HI>now</HI> that he is far removed from the voice of my complainings, and can no longer be di&s;armed by their &s;weet impre&s;&s;ion, &s;uffer, oh &s;uffer me to mourn &mdash; &s;uffer me to ex|ecrate that wanton and in&s;atiable <HI>power,</HI> which &s;catters de&s;olation o'er the land! Ah this dire <HI>daemon</HI> of <HI>battle!</HI> &mdash;this <HI>daeman,</HI> who, with giant foot&s;teps, tramples upon the be&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful af|fections of the &s;oul&mdash; who delights to hear the wail of the wounded, and the groans of the expiring&mdash;who&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;ail upon a &s;ea of tears, and are wafted by &s;ighs which are extorted from the tender bo&s;om. I &s;ee, I &s;ee the &s;anguinary power. He &s;hoots athwart the realms of affrighted fancy, in a robe of crim&s;on ten times dyed in the blood of his votaries. The &s;oft verdure of the &s;pring withers as he advances. The &s;treams of plenty, which fertilized a happy wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld, &s;tand checked in their progre&s;s, or roll onward a bed of troubled waters.

<P>Hear, O humanity, the reply, and be <HI>&s;till</HI> if thou can&s;t! The rulers of different realms, in the wanton exertion of power, infringe upon what is fal&s;ely called the property of each other. Men, who are utter &s;trangers to the very per&s;ons of one another, and are &s;eparated, perhaps, by partitions of a thou&s;and leagues, quarrel for a few vile acres of the dirt which &s;hall pre&s;ently cover the toiling race; and the lives of a people are devoted to the &s;word. Earth it&s;elf, wide as is extended her beautiful domain, is not <HI>enough</HI> exten&s;ive for the&s;e pigmy mortals to divide among&s;t them&s;elves; nor are the natural mi&s;eries of a very &s;hort life, with all its moral, all its civil, all its &s;ocial evils, &s;ufficient, without the aids of untimely and <HI>voluntary</HI> &s;laughter.

of &s;ickne&s;s, to alleviate the &s;u&s;pen&s;e of her beloved Emma (in regard to the promi&s;ed articles of confidence) &s;he in&s;tructs me to acquaint you, in the conci&s;e&s;t way that I am able, of the means by which &s;he became the wife of your unfortunate brother, as well as with the rea&s;ons which prevailed with her to keep that union a &s;e|cret from <HI>his</HI> family, from her <HI>own,</HI> and from the <HI>world.</HI> She con|ceives too, that the deeper colours of di&s;tre&s;s in <HI>her</HI> fate, may, by compari&s;on, alleviate the &s;ofter tints of wretchedne&s;s in <HI>your's</HI>; for at the wor&s;t, my dear cou&s;in, as matters now &s;tand, you have a lover living who is very properly the object of many a charming hope; while the poor Loui&s;a is daily tortured with reflecting on the death of one yet dearer than a lover&mdash;even a hu&s;band and a father, who is the object of many a mi&s;ery too mighty for the &s;olace of &s;ighs and tears.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the letter I have had the plea&s;ure to receive from you it be&s;peaks a heart overflowing with &s;treams of genuine philanthro|py, and beautifully becomes the pen of Emma Corbett.

The voice of public fame is, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, louder than that of private affection. The world fixes an earne&s;t look on the actions of an officer. One hero inflames another: the &s;parks of glory pa&s;s like an electric power: the nece&s;&s;ity of a brave <HI>example</HI> becomes apparent: the profe&s;&s;ion &s;oon grows into a darling pa&s;&s;ion: the blood warms: the genius of war takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every facul|ty: home connexions are forgotten: the &s;cene of action terminates the pro&s;pect: the warrior can &s;ee no farther. Valour and victory &s;eem marching before him.

<P>The&s;e, my lovely cou&s;in, are not the &s;entiments of a theori&s;t, but caught immediately from the lips of the very heroes who prac|ti&s;ed every action they relate. In the interval of peace, few men of any order have a more elegant humanity than the Engli&s;h offi|cers; and all the endearing qualifications, which make up the great dome&s;tic characters, are to be found among&s;t them; but in the day of conte&s;t, my cou&s;in, a different duty calls upon them, and military fame is as ea&s;ily wounded, and its wounds as vital to felicity, as tho&s;e of a woman.</P>

<P>P. S. I find you are &s;till indi&s;po&s;ed, and may, perhaps, want amu&s;ement in your &s;olitude. To this end I &s;end you the FRAGMENT of a little military hi&s;tory found among&s;t my father's papers. It will &s;hew you that humanity and bravery are nearly allied, and that the tender hu&s;band and good &s;oldier often form the &s;ame character, though they cannot always exert them&s;elves in the &s;ame moment; or, perhaps, were we to &s;crutinize nicely, we &s;hould, in reality, find, that when the &s;oldier is hazarding his life and liberty for that of his wife, his children, his countrymen, and his King, he is <HI>then</HI> the tendere&s;t lover, the worthie&s;t hu&s;band, the be&s;t parent, the mo&s;t loyal &s;ubject, and the mo&s;t valuable citizen. I believe it was written by my father in his youth, and I con&s;ider it as a family relique.</P>

<HEAD>A MILITARY FRAGMENT. THE CARBINES.</HEAD>
<P>*****OH for the hi&s;tory of that wound! &s;aid I, &s;eeing a &s;car upon the cheek of the per&s;on appointed to &s;hew me the ho&s;pital! &mdash; Oh for the hi&s;tory of that wound!</P>
<P>Not worth the telling, an&s;wered the man, pointing to the &s;tump of his left thigh as to a more important &s;ubject of curio&s;ity He took me into a different quarter of the building, which pre&s;ented the lodgings of tho&s;e who were pen&s;ioners. In each was a &s;mall bed, a chair, and a table. The attendant's name was Julius Carbine. At a door leading into one of the apartments be &s;topped: and then looked through an aperture, which commanded the room.</P>
<P>The luckie&s;t of all moments, &s;aid Julius &mdash; for brother Ne&s;tor will &s;oon be at it, and it is a day of di&s;cipline. We will enter.&mdash; Julius, &s;aid the owner of the apartment, as we entered, &s;it down with your company. The &s;ide of the bed was covered with a clean white cloth, by a little girl who opened the door, and I had al&s;o a little girl with me, and we all &s;at down. It was actually the <HI>brother,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not the brother <HI>&s;oldier</HI> only, to whom Julius introduced us. In their appearance there was a fraternal <HI>&s;imilarity,</HI> not &s;o con|&s;i&s;ting in the features and limbs which remained, as in the misfor|tunes
<PB N="10" REF="017678_0058_0FA21F3E7B6FF528">
which had happened to tho&s;e invi&s;ible parts which lay &s;cat|tered in different quarters of the globe.</P>
<P>Julius was the younger of the Carbines, and as he placed him&s;elf <HI>&s;ide ways</HI> upon the bed, and de&s;ired Carbine the elder (who&s;e name was Ne&s;tor) to &s;u&s;pend the attack &mdash; he told his &s;tory.</P>
<P>We &s;lept in the &s;ame cradle, and were nur&s;ed up for the &s;ervice. Our little arms&mdash;</P>
<P>He flouri&s;hed a &s;tump which projected about four inches from the right &s;houlder&mdash;Our little arms&mdash;</P>
<P>But I have begun the matter wrong and prematurely, for before I relate the account which Carbine gave of him&s;elf, I &s;hould offer &s;ome de&s;cription of his per&s;on, as well as that of his brother Ne&s;tor. It is the &s;tump of Julius which reminds me of this.</P>
<P>Carbine the elder was the remnant of a noble figure, who in the uprightne&s;s of his youth mu&s;t have ri&s;en &s;ix feet from the earth per|pendicularly. He had the marks of about &s;eventy years wearing in his face &mdash; allowing for the natural vigour of his form, the in|va&s;ions of incident, time, and profe&s;&s;ion. The pre&s;ent &s;toop in his &s;houlders was favourable to the height, or rather to the want of height in his apartment. It is not without ju&s;t cau&s;e that I called Ne&s;tor a <HI>remnant.</HI> Nature originally formed in him her faire&s;t pro|portions. At the time I &s;aw him he was a capital figure reduced. For in&s;tance, if you looked him in the face, or, more properly to &s;peak, in the re&s;idue of his face, you would perceive, in his left cheek, a deep &s;carification, which boa&s;ted no &s;ort of rival&s;hip with the glorious embrowning of the other that had received no in|jury. Though Ne&s;tor him&s;elf &s;aid, "the whole cheek, in com|pari&s;on with the half cheek, looked like an errant poltroon." "It is a cheek," cried he, "which &s;eems to have done no duty; now here," continued he, turning the other &s;ide to view with much tri|umph, "here are the &s;igns of &s;ervice."</P>
<P>Both the Carbines, indeed, had <HI>&s;erved</HI> to &s;ome purpo&s;e. In point of honorary cred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntials there was little cau&s;e of jealou&s;y. Nothing could be more equally divided than the mutual marks of brother|hood in bravery. Sorely battered were the outworks of both. It is worth while to ob&s;erve how the matter was &s;ettled to their &s;atis|faction and credit. The thigh of Julius became the victim of a parapet, but then Ne&s;tor was even with him when he had the ho|nour to drop his left arm in the counter&s;carp. But as if fortune did not imagine an arm, and that a <HI>left</HI> arm, a &s;ufficient equivalent to a whole thigh, amputated at one deci&s;ive whizz by a cannon ball, &s;he deprived Ne&s;tor of his right foot, which was left at the bottom of an entrenchment in Flanders. The younger Carbine had the track of a mu&s;ket vi&s;ible at the extremity of his neck, and the bul|lets, with which that mu&s;ket was charged, &s;lanted along the left jaw, carrying off &s;ome of the fine&s;t teeth in the world, and which, perhaps, are even yet to be &s;een in one of the fo&s;&s;es To bring the military &s;cale even, on the part of Julius, he has the good fortune to conceal under his hat (which, upon account of that concealment he
<PB N="11" REF="017678_0059_0FA21F3F39481BB8">
&s;eldom wears) a re&s;pectable contu&s;ion, which, beginning at the left ear, &s;wept away, not only the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eate&s;t part of that, but all that grew in its path, from one end to the other; which di&s;tingui&s;h|ing &s;troke is in honor of the ba&s;tion. But Julius had his <HI>uno&s;tenta|tious</HI> wounds too: his &s;hirt covering no le&s;s than &s;ix, in&s;omuch that his bo&s;om was cro&s;&s;ed this way and that, direct and tran&s;ver&s;e, like a draught board. I detected the flu&s;h of &s;omething like vic|tory in the countenance of Julius, as he threw open his chitterlin, and opened his &s;hirt-collar under pretence of too much heat: but Carbine the elder checked his brother's ambition by by baring his right arm to his &s;houlder, (or rather begging <HI>me</HI> to bare it) and there di&s;covering a ma&s;ked battery of blows, which were a fair match for tho&s;e in the brea&s;t of Julius.</P>
<P>Thus were the te&s;timonies of their prow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s participated; and if (&s;aid they) either of us could have boa&s;ted a le&s;s equal divi&s;ion, it would have been a blow too many for our friend&s;hip, and, perhaps, have bred ill blood betwixt us.</P>
<P><HI>Here the fragment is torn.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash; the veteran Carbines, after having platooned and pioneered it for a number of years, in the cau&s;e of their country, found at length they could keep the field no longer.</P>
<P>They entered the Temple of Peace: but not quite on the footing of ordinary members. The &s;enior Carbine privately enjoyed &s;ome &s;mall privileges, and the junior was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;ual|ties derivable from &s;hewing the ho&s;pital to &s;uch as had the curio&s;ity to &s;urvey it: and he hopped about with his <HI>ruins</HI> in a manner that engaged one's pity and admiration.</P>
<P><HI>A &s;econd rent in the fragment.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>Now Ne&s;tor was a man of enalienable affections. They were not to be &s;ubdued. The military pa&s;&s;ion was by no means dead in his bo&s;om. The heart of the &s;oldier was &s;till vi&s;ible in his little bed-chamber. There were to be &s;een, &s;u&s;pended from the walls, the battered co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;let that had covered his brea&s;t, and the firelock, who&s;e iron mouth was almo&s;t worn out by the loadings. They were brightly burni&s;hed, and the nice&s;t care taken to clean them weekly.</P>
<P>But this was nothing. The practical part of a &s;oldier's di&s;cipline did Ne&s;tor carry on in a room of forty inches diameter.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were we all &s;eated by the &s;ide of the bed, than a &s;in|gular ceremony began. He had &s;ix &s;ons, all little, all living for their country, and in &s;ecret training for the battle under their father. It was his cu&s;tom, thrice in the week, to turn the key upon all the pen&s;ioners but his brother, and in&s;truct his family in the art of war. Poor as he was, he had actually been at the co&s;t of equipping them; had fitted up for them &s;omething that re&s;embled a uniform, and
<PB N="12" REF="017678_0060_0FA21F3FF1B1DCE0">
in miniature accoutrements, pre&s;ented them with the &s;word, the mu&s;quet, and the bayonet.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier's &s;cience was taught them by the veteran. One branch or another of the art military was the &s;ubject of every day. The &s;ons of Ne&s;tor Carbine knew not the enervating luxuries of artificial heat: they thawed the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;ons with nobler fires. Their education was wholly martial. At night they li&s;tened to the lecture, and their &s;words were drawn forth to practi&s;e what they had heard in the morn. They engaged their &s;trengthening arms in the <HI>mock</HI> fight, that they might be prepared for the <HI>real</HI> one. It was now the evening of the ravelin, then of the flanking; now of the fortification, then of the fo&s;&s;&eacute;; now of the half-moon, then of the epaulment; now of the &s;aps, and then of the ambu&s;|cade; now of the horn-works, and then of the ba&s;tion; now of the gabion, and then again of the mines, the parapet, the battery, or the tenaille.</P>
<P>They had ju&s;t began an engagement as we entered the room &mdash; It will be be&s;t related before the younger Carbine tells his &s;tory. Let him therefore repo&s;e a little longer upon the bed.</P>
<P>The &s;tripling troops were drawn up three deep in the centre of the room, and the object of attack was a large deal trunk &s;et up|right betwixt the contending parties. One &s;ide were to oppo&s;e and one to defend. The father was commander, and in good time came the brother, who, in&s;tead of repo&s;ing on the bed as above|mentioned, &s;prung up with &s;urprizing agility, and hopped away to head the adver&s;e party, making a kind of warlike mu&s;ic with a lit|tle drum tattoo'd by the timber in&s;trument that &s;erved him for an arm. Ne&s;tor, meantime, a&s;&s;umed a whi&s;tle which &s;erved for a clarionet.</P>
<P>The engagement was carried on in the exacte&s;t military order; they advanced, they retreated, they rallied, and they came on again.&mdash; Every little heart panted with ambition, every eye &s;parkled with ex|pectation of victory. The mimic ardour &s;oon became real, and the two generals were them&s;elves wrought up into a &s;erious &s;en&s;ation. Julius &s;houted, and Ne&s;tor encouraged. But, pre&s;ently, the a&s;pect of the battle altered, for one of the <HI>be&s;iegers</HI> (a boy of uncommon bra|very) took one of the <HI>be&s;ieged</HI> pri&s;oner. The conqueror flouri&s;hed his little &s;oil, but the captive &s;hed tears of &s;lavery and &s;orrow. The ge|neral on the wor&s;ted &s;ide affected to be di&s;mayed. His opponent &s;pirited up his army, pur&s;ued his victory, took a a &s;econd of the enemy pri&s;oner, and the town (that is the <HI>box</HI>) was taken.</P>
<P>A &s;hout of joy was heard on one &s;ide, while the poor remains o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the conquered troops fled to a corner that was the interior en|campment behind the bed. Julius beat the dead march with his wooden drum-&s;tick: but Ne&s;tor and his troops, having bur&s;t the city gates, (that is the box <HI>lid</HI>) proceeded to plunder. It con|tained all the magazines of the enemy, con&s;i&s;ting of new foils, martial caps, belts, wooden bayonets, confections, and fruits. The&s;e were the prizes of conque&s;t. They were all fairly won, and
<PB N="13" REF="017678_0061_0FA21F42811F3370">
divided among&s;t the victors according to &s;eniority. The little girl, who had &s;at on the bed, now &s;prung up, took a &s;mall ozier-ba&s;ket, from a hook, and &s;trewed flowers in the path of the victorious, &s;inging a &s;ong of triumph as they marched round the room. The ceremonies, however, being over, both parties came forward, and &s;hook hands very heartily, in token of good-will, and then the af|fair ended with "God &s;ave great George our King" and a gene|ral huzza.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>Our little arms, continued Julius, (whom I will interupt no more) were nur&s;ed into early vigour for the field: for our fa|ther, who&s;e bones&mdash;May every Saint ble&s;s them &s;aid Ne&s;tor&mdash; have been repo&s;ing more than half a century, in different parts of Flanders and Germany, &s;truck fir&s;t into that mode of training which my brother ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> adopted. Other people's children have playthings given the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, they whimper for them; but we were never allowed &s;o much as a hoop or a top till we gained it by a vic|tory. We knew the difficulty of obtaining the prize, and valued it the more; and thus were fitted for deeds of hardihood, ere other infants had an idea of glory.</P>
<P>Poor creatures! &s;aid Ne&s;tor's &s;econd &s;on &s;cornfully.</P>
<P><HI>We</HI> could vault upon the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeds of the menage before <HI>they</HI> could keep the &s;addle of their wooden ponies. Ripe for practice, we were &s;ent forth at an early age to the field, and both of us entered as volunteers in the &s;ervice of our country.&mdash;We did &s;o &s;aid Ne&s;tor.</P>
<P>Nature &mdash; for which &s;tump as I am, I &s;till thank her&mdash;gave us no bad forms; and, though we took the field with faces as effeminate as that of our mother, [You was reckoned the very mode<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her, you know, Ne&s;tor] &mdash; yet the fir&s;t campaign left us no room to blu&s;h upon that &s;core, Our virgin engagement happened in the hotte&s;t glow of the &s;ummer, and we were &s;oon rid of a delicacy which is inglorious on the front of a &s;oldier. Oh with what plea&s;ure did we contemplate the alterations at our return!&mdash;I remember it &s;aid Ne&s;tor, &s;miling.</P>
<P>The traits of the mother were quite worn out by the weather. &mdash; In every lineament there was &s;ea&s;oning. The &s;un had written hero in our countenances, and we rejoiced in the dignity of the tan.</P>
<P>But mark the joke, Sir; a fanta&s;tical pair of wenches pretended to love us, in our fair-weather &s;uit of features, before we made the fir&s;t &s;ally, that is, before we were <HI>worth</HI> loving; but took it into their heads to quarrel with our appearance the very moment we re|turned. They wanted &s;till to &s;ee the red and white of the <HI>woman,</HI> and &s;o took to them&s;elves new paramours&mdash;The jades gave us up, Sir, for a couple of fellows who would &s;hudder at the patter of a hail-&s;torm.</P>
<P>So much the better, &s;aid Ne&s;tor. We have had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee one of the ra&s;cals hanged for &s;heep-&s;tealing, and the other you know is to be put into the pillory this day &s;e'ennight.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="017678_0062_0FA21F43009E3BD0">And I'll be prepared for him, I warrant ye, exclaimed one of the boys.&mdash;No, child, &s;aid Ne&s;tor: he is no mark for the &s;on of a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>After this, Sir, we had no lazy periods of peace. Some part or another of Europe was continually beating the drum or &s;ounding the trumpet in the ear of England. It was our duty to go forth in her defence.</P>
<P>Father, &s;aid the elde&s;t of the boys, when is it likely we &s;hall have a <HI>war?</HI></P>
<P>My brother, Sir, &mdash; (continued Carbine, who was not put out by any family remarks) &mdash; my brother, Sir, had the honour of the fir&s;t misfortune. &mdash; You do not call it by a right name, &s;aid Ne&s;tor.</P>
<P><HI>He</HI> triumphed in the fir&s;t te&s;timony of the warrior. &mdash; I am an elder brother, &s;aid Ne&s;tor, and the fir&s;t blow was my birth-right.</P>
<P>But I was &s;oon even with him; for, towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> clo&s;e of the campaign, a random &s;hot &mdash; when I was thinking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nothing le&s;s, &mdash; gave the four fingers of my left hand to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">emy. In that condition we entered into winter quarters.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner was my brother cured of the wound in his face. &mdash; You may &s;ee the mark of it here, Sir, &s;aid Ne&s;tor. &mdash; in his face, than he received one much deeper in his heart!</P>
<P>In his <HI>heart,</HI> cried the younge&s;t of the &s;ix &s;ons, clapping his hand on his father's &s;ide? &mdash; why, you joke: here it is alive and merry now. I can feel it beat.</P>
<P>God keep it &s;o, an&s;wered the elde&s;t. It will be a &s;ore day for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s when that &s;tops, I promi&s;e thee.</P>
<P>Give me thy hand, Ferdinand, &s;aid Ne&s;tor; and brother, do you go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with your &s;tory, for it entertains the gentleman and his little daughter, and I like to hear it. You were always good at a &s;tory from a child. Go on.</P>
<P>&mdash;Would you believe it, Sir, that a fellow &s;o &s;liced &s;hould have the impudence to attack one of the prettie&s;t girls in England?</P>
<P>In the <HI>world,</HI> you might have &s;aid, cried Ne&s;tor, &s;haking his knee.</P>
<P>&mdash;Like a brave boy of the blade, he pu&s;hed his point right on, turned his <HI>wor&s;t</HI> &s;ide to the wench, and in&s;i&s;ted upon her taking the &s;cars as a recommendation.</P>
<P>Why they <HI>were</HI> &s;o, &s;aid Ne&s;tor, holding his knee &s;till while he &s;poke.</P>
<P>&mdash;In this manner he continued to batter the citadel which trem|bled in the bo&s;om of the pool girl, and in le&s;s than a month (no time at all for &s;uch a &s;iege) he entered the fair ca&s;tle of her affections in triumph.</P>
<P>By the blood that I have &s;hed&punc; Sir, &s;aid Ne&s;tor, and by the drops which <HI>yet</HI> flow in my body, Frances was the be&s;t and brave&s;t wench that ever lay by the &s;ide of a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>Ne&s;tor, &s;aid Julius, hold your tongue. &mdash; His limbs, Sir, were almo&s;t con&s;tantly on the move. War carried them away. What
<PB N="15" REF="017678_0063_0FA21F43B150D508">
of that? His joke was ready. Never mind, Frances, (would he &s;ay to his wife) I am the winner yet, fear nothing. Were I redu|ced to my trunk, I &s;hould flouri&s;h &s;till, my girl. A &s;oldier, who&s;e children have blood in their veins, is invulnerable. He is immor|tal in his &s;ons.</P>
<P>Let us <HI>engage,</HI> father! &s;aid one of the boys eagerly, as he bran|di&s;hed his foil.</P>
<P>Thus would my brother heal up the wounds of the war: but be that as it may, wounds are but &s;orry things in a family. Often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s my brother di&s;puted with me on this &s;ubject. "Julius, (would he &s;ay ) thou art but half a loyal &s;ubject &s;till &mdash; thou give&s;t to thy country the &s;ervices only of an individual, while <HI>I</HI> furni&s;h it with the force of a whole family. As an <HI>individual,</HI> thou mu&s;t &s;oon die; but had&s;t thou taken care to <HI>multiply</HI> thy&s;elf as I have done, thou mighte&s;t well expect to live and conquer the&s;e thou&s;and years. Brot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r, brother, it is a fal&s;e notion; a &s;oldier ought of all men in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Maje&s;ty's dominions the &s;oone&s;t to marry: he ought indeed." Notwith&s;tanding this, Sir, I could never be prevailed upon. No, though an hone&s;t girl offered to &s;ling my knap&s;ack acro&s;s her &s;houlder after the lo&s;s of my thigh. To confe&s;s the plain truth, to you, I did not like certain ceremonies betwixt my brother and &s;i&s;ter, at their partings. Frances indeed wept but little, but, in my opinion, &s;he <HI>looked</HI> a much deeper &s;orrow than is to be expre&s;&s;ed by a pair of wet eyes.</P>
<P>&mdash;Ne&s;tor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emm'd violently.</P>
<P>And as to my brother, though he cocked his hat fiercely &mdash; pre|tended to have caught cold &mdash; rubbed up his accoutrements, and blu&s;tered mightily, he never was &s;teadily him&s;elf &mdash; and how the devil <HI>&s;hould</HI> he be &mdash; for a week after. The&s;e things, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> again&s;t the grain.

<P>But this is not the wor&s;t, Sir. <HI>Death</HI> &s;ometimes comes at the bottom of the account to <HI>un&s;oldier</HI> a man. He knocked at brother Ne&s;tor's door, and carried Frances away while &s;he was nur&s;ing him of a fever into which he was thrown by the pain of a wound. &mdash; Zounds! that was a terrible day, Ne&s;tor, was it not?</P>
<P>Terrible! &s;aid Ne&s;tor, turning his head from the company.</P>
<P>She died &s;uddenly. Courage, &s;aid I, brother. He waved his hand, and &s;poke not. Brother, &s;aid I, have courage. "Fool, replied he, in a pa&s;&s;ion &mdash; (if had he called me &s;o in cold blood, I would have had him out)&mdash;Fool, &s;aid he, (in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> way that one could not but forgive him, &s;tamping his foot on the ground at the &s;ame time) am I, thinke&s;t thou, before GOD ALMIGHTY or the enemy? What has courage to do before him? thou &s;hould'&s;t tell me to be <HI>patient.</HI>" I &s;aid no more: for the poor Frances lay dead before

<P>Child, (&s;aid Ne&s;tor, to the little girl, his daughter, who was &s;obbing at the &s;ide of the bed, with her apron thrown over her eyes) &mdash;come hither. Thou art <HI>like</HI> thy mother &mdash; ki&s;s me.</P>
<P>Ne&s;tor (continued Julius) tied the crape round his arm, and his &s;oul was in mourning. He gave Frances to the earth. Decency &mdash;<HI>Go no farther,</HI> &s;aid Ne&s;tor,</P>
<P>&mdash;Decency required <HI>my</HI> attendance, Sir. My poor Carbine &s;hed then the fir&s;t tears that I ever &s;aw upon his cheek.

<P><HI>I</HI> KNOW not whether I &s;hall live long enough to relate the horrors of my &s;ituation!</P>
<P>On the evening of the day that I de&s;ired the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, I felt an impul&s;e, more &s;trong and more &s;acred than that of common curio&s;ity, to know the full &s;cope of my &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P><HI>Before</HI> this interview, my di&s;tre&s;s appeared &s;ufficiently great. Alas&punc; we are continually exclaiming that the heart will break, without knowing what additional burthens it will bear, even when we think it is <HI>mo&s;t</HI> &s;urcharged.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVI. TO EMMA CORBETT.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prior to the receipt of the above.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>NO, my loved &s;i&s;ter, I will not, cannot, &s;end a long &s;tory. A few pages will compri&s;e the main circum&s;tances; and let tho&s;e &s;uffice till days of future conver&s;ation. &mdash; Your father had ever an ambition to enlarge the fortune of his Edward by marriage: and Edward had already &s;ufficient to his wi&s;hes. He acquainted his father of the love which he bore to Loui&s;a. It produced a di&s;|pute. My brother happened to be pre&s;ent. He entered as your father exclaimed, "What but beggary can be expected with a girl like Loui&s;a Hammond, of &s;carce an hundred pounds a year?" &mdash; The conver&s;ation &s;topped.</P>
<P>Sir, (&s;aid Henry to Edward, when they were alone) had any man living but Emma's father &s;poke in the&s;e terms of my &s;i&s;ter, he &s;hould have been puni&s;hed for it &s;everely. &mdash; I love <HI>Emma Corbett,</HI> and to her he is indebted for&mdash;</P>
<P>And I love <HI>Loui&s;a Hammond,</HI> Sir, (replied your brother) but my father has an arm of his own, and that failing, he has that of a <HI>&s;on,</HI> to defend him from the in&s;ults of a boy, &s;hould he <HI>dare</HI> to &mdash;</P>
<P>It is an improper place to di&s;cu&s;s the que&s;tion, &s;aid Henry. They went out. Henry commanded Edward, in terms of intole|rable &s;everity, never to offer his hand to Loui&s;a, while Edward in&s;i&s;ted, that Henry &s;hould de&s;i&s;t from farther engaging the affecti|ons of Emma. The inhibition was promi&s;ed to be ob&s;erved, and a breach of it was to terminate in the la&s;t frightful deci&s;ion among&s;t men. Edward dropped his vi&s;its, and I knew not the cau&s;e. Henry did the &s;ame, and you were equally ignorant of the motive. I fell &s;ick; a fever &s;eized my &s;pirits, and my life was de&s;paired of. Edward heard of my illne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and came to vi&s;it me at a time when he knew Henry was from home. He found me in the extremity &mdash; the fever was become pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rid, and the phy&s;ician ordered no one to approach my breath any nearer than could be avoided; the bed was &s;trewed
<PB N="20" REF="017678_0068_0FA21F49EFD38F90">
with the herbs which are &s;uppo&s;ed to prevent infection. Regardle&s;s of this, and every other image of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, Edward ru&s;hed into my chamber, threw him&s;elf upon his knees by the &s;ide of the bed, and hung his head over my face, which received and welcomed the tender tears that were &s;treaming from his eyes. O! Loui&s;a, Loui&s;a, (&s;aid he) I can bear it no longer! At the&s;e words Henry was heard upon the &s;tairs, Edward leaped up &mdash; Heavens! &s;aid he, can it be po&s;&s;ible, is Henry returned? Well, it is no matter. My brother entered the room, and at the &s;ight of Edward &s;tept back, like a man a&s;toni&s;hed. Edward ran up to him, threw his arms about his neck, and in&s;i&s;ted that the embrace &s;hould be returned. Oh Henry, he exclaimed, too long have we mutually &s;uffered a fal&s;e delicacy to prevail. Enough have we &s;acrificed to pique, for Emma and Loui&s;a have been the victims. I heard that your &s;i&s;ter was dying, and I could not deny my&s;elf the mournful privi|lege of a friend&mdash; will you chide me for it, Henry? &mdash; will you &s;till withhold your hand and your heart from the brother of Emma Corbett? <HI>Will you?</HI> This was the fir&s;t moment I had been in|formed of the di&s;pute. The &s;urpri&s;e was too much for me in the <HI>firme&s;t</HI> &s;tate of my con&s;titution. In the condition I <HI>then</HI> was, it had well-nigh proved fatal. All which my &s;trength &s;uffered me to do was to rai&s;e my&s;elf on my pillow, fold my hands in the attitude of intreaty, and with feeble accents to implore, they would &s;pare my la&s;t moments, and not embitter them by <HI>their</HI> enmity.</P>
<P>Ere I had uttered this, Henry and Edward were weeping on the necks of each other, and Henry &s;aid, alas! Edward, I <HI>owe</HI> you more than this, for on my part was the promi&s;e fir&s;t broken. I have &s;ecretly maintained the u&s;ual corre&s;pondence with Emma, &s;ince &s;he has been away: and found the <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> &s;uperior to the <HI>anger</HI> of my temper. Indeed we have <HI>both</HI> been wrong. Henceforward, let us be <HI>more</HI> than friends &mdash; if po&s;&s;ible, let us be brothers. Shall we not, my Edward?</P>
<P>Again, Emma, I cla&s;ped my hands, and a &s;udden &s;en&s;e of joy came over me that gave a turn &mdash; a <HI>happy</HI> turn to my di&s;order. I recovered. It was agreed between us that the <HI>cau&s;e of the quarrel,</HI> and the means of the reconciliation, &s;hould be equally a &s;ecret. The families were re-united, and none but Edward, Henry, and Loui&s;a, could account for the late coolne&s;s on the part of the two former. But the harmony was not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> long duration; &mdash; it was again interrupted by your father's violence in the cau&s;e of <HI>America,</HI> oppo&s;ed to that of my brother in the cau&s;e of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Edward &s;ided with the former, and, though it no longer prevented an intercour&s;e between us, it threatened an eternal &s;eparation of political intere&s;ts. At the &s;ame time Henry was permitted to addre&s;s you, and Edward continued openly his partiality for me. &mdash; Nay, your father at la&s;t declared, he hoped &s;till to &s;ee the two countries re&s;tored to the embraces of each other, and two happy matches to felicitate their union. You were, my dear Emma, fortunately from home on a vi&s;it during mo&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions,
<PB N="21" REF="017678_0069_0FA21F4B250D07F8">
and your Henry did not think it prudent to break the thread, of an elegant affection by the little jarrings that were happening to cro&s;s it at home. The conte&s;t now became fierce on the other &s;ide the Atlantic&punc; and threatened to carry blood&s;hed and rapine to that part of the continent where Edward had property. Loui&s;a (&s;aid he to me, one evening) I mu&s;t cro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;eas: my fortune is in danger: it equally concerns you and me, that I &s;hould endeavour to defend ti, yet I will wait another month to hear the event of terms that are propo&s;ing between the countries &mdash; if they produce <HI>peace,</HI> you know how ready I &s;hall be to continue in England; if they <HI>fail</HI> of that end, you mu&s;t have re&s;olution enough to part from me for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on. But, continued he, as no man can tell the chances of the &s;lighte&s;t &s;eparation, I ardently wi&s;h to call you by the ten|dere&s;t of all human titles, <HI>mine,</HI> before I go. <HI>Publickly</HI> this cannot be done, for though my father affects to con&s;ent, our union would make him unhappy. No, Loui&s;a: let our happine&s;s be known only to our&s;elves till it is proper to communicate it. Impart it not&punc; till my return at lea&s;t, to Emma, to Henry, or to any part of the family. I have my rea&s;ons for it, even more &s;trong than tho&s;e that have been already related.</P>
<P>Soon after this conver&s;ation, Emma, we were privately married, and none of the appointments that led to the ceremony, or which &s;ucceeded it, were di&s;covered or &s;u&s;pected. Previous to the voyage of my haple&s;s hu&s;band, he put into my hand a &s;ealed paper, con|taining his will, and he de&s;ired I would not open it till his return&punc; in the fond hope of that return being po&s;&s;ible&punc; I have, till within the&s;e few days, kept the &s;eal unbroken, and now, alas! I find it is a te&s;tamentary di&s;po&s;al of his property abroad, bequeathed en|tirely to me as &s;ole executrix. &mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, my dear Emma, there <HI>is</HI> a fatherle&s;s Edward, and Heaven only knows whether the father had any knowledge of his birth before he died. I repeatedly &s;ent letters, full of all a mother's minute and affecting &s;olicitude, but I received no replies.</P>
<P>To Mrs. Arnold, dear and generous friend! I owe the power of keeping my hu&s;band's &s;ecret, not-with&s;tanding an event that promi&s;ed to betray it. The poor little one was lately taken ill, and his death ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry moment expected. It was that (oh Nature!) made me write the di&s;ordered &s;crawl, which intreated Emma to forbear her vi&s;it. On my reaching the hou&s;e of our worthy Caroline.

<P>My prayer was heard. My child grew well. Your letter came in the warme&s;t, newe&s;t, and mo&s;t melting moment of matron extacy. The &s;mile of the babe was in my eye, and in my heart.

<P>THE irre&s;olute note which I &s;ent this morning to your chamber, is not worth your attempting to decypher. I wanted to expre&s;s my &s;ympathy of your pre&s;ent misfortune in a way more an&s;werable to the emotions of my friend&s;hip. I wi&s;hed to gather &s;uch knowledge of &s;ome per&s;ons <HI>connected with your lo&s;s.</HI> as might enable me to plan &s;ome pious fraud to relieve your &s;ituation with|out wounding your delicacy. But I &s;hould make bungling work of it, and de&s;troy the felicity I intended to promote. I am a man of plain feelings, and have no dexterity of addre&s;s when it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to adorn them. Accept then, dear Corbett, of an hone&s;t mind, in lieu of elegant manners. Is any decoration nece&s;&s;ary to introduce a friendly circum&s;tance? &mdash; and if there is not, where|fore do I thus lengthen the preface?</P>
<P>Corbett, I am one of tho&s;e whom the world calls an unthrifty fellow: for I value money merely as it conduces to my happine&s;s. My happine&s;s depends on &s;ociety, and not on my&s;elf alone, I have fixed it in the dear dome&s;tic circle that enclo&s;es Emma and her father. Beyond that barrier I do not de&s;ire to wander; and if I can promote their felicity, my own will, of nece&s;&s;ity, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> compleat.

chance I am become rich, you know. The &s;um I po&s;&s;e&s;s is too much to be di&s;&s;ipated, and not enough if I had a pa&s;&s;ion to accumulate. It is quite &s;ufficient to render three per&s;ons happy, &s;o far as happine&s;s takes its colour from money. Among&s;t three per&s;ons then let it be divided; but let only two of tho&s;e know the &s;ource by which the third is &s;upplied. You may ea&s;ily per&s;uade Emma to believe, (what indeed will be true) that by an unexpected turn, your lo&s;&s;es are repaired. She will be too much rejoiced at the event to teaze her&s;elf about the means. Or, if &s;he <HI>&s;hould</HI> en|quire, her curio&s;ity is of a tender kind, and will readily be pacified. I hope you love me too well to make &s;cruples; and yet I &s;hall pre|pare my&s;elf to combat them.

<P>I FANCY there was &s;ome <HI>mi&s;take</HI> in the letter that I inclo&s;ed from Corbett: for I find his affairs are all re-adju&s;ted, and the generous refu&s;al of my overtures to Emma (at a time when mo&s;t parents would think them mo&s;t acceptable) has no longer force. The prohibition is taken off, and I am again at liberty to make my&s;elf tenderly unhappy.</P>
<P>Corbett is now as much recovered in health as in his circum&s;tan|ces, and word is ju&s;t brought that Emma is better. O my heart, how &s;hall I &s;upport the &s;ight of her! &mdash;If her &s;ickne&s;s has made any great alteration&mdash;if &s;he appears to be in pain, or in any kind of danger, I &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly di&s;cover my&s;elf.</P>

<P>SOON after breakfa&s;t this morning, while Corbett and I were walking in the garden, he took hold of my hand, and laying it to his brea&s;t, &s;aid, "Now, Sir Robert, is the time: my daughter is recovered.

<P>I WILL not affect to mi&s;conceive you, my only parent. You &s;eem con&s;tantly anxious to connect me with &s;ome worthy man, as the a&s;&s;ociate of my life; yet do not recollect that my choice is made, my principles fixed, and my heart <HI>inalienably</HI> engaged. An un&s;ubdued veneration for truth attends me. I caught the in|&s;piring affection I bear her, from the re&s;pectable authors of my being. It is a prejudice as early as it is amiable, and you &s;hould not wonder if I walk &s;teadily in the way of my directors. This, &s;ir, I have often told you. I have been brought up to con&s;ider the happine&s;s of life, not as deducible from the maxims of the world, but from implicit reliance upon that power whom Heaven has &s;eated upon the throne of the &s;oul, as an un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ring judge in all ca&s;es of moral arbitration. It has been a hard ta&s;k for me to &s;truggle with the various inflictions which have long hung over our hou&s;e, and though the bur&s;t of nature has &s;ometimes broken unawares, it was not in <HI>tho&s;e</HI> &s;ea&s;ons that I was the mo&s;t unhappy. &mdash; When only the pitying eye of GOD was upon me, when I &s;ought the &s;ilent corner, and could &s;ecretly commune with my own heart, and en|ter into all its inclinings: then &mdash; <HI>then,</HI> my father, it was that the extreme of your Emma's wretchedne&s;s came over her; for &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to wean her affections from an object, one &s;o entirely and with &s;o good rea&s;on approved, and now &s;o entirely, and (you will pardon me) without any &s;olid rea&s;ons, rejected. I have not, at this period, my deare&s;t father, collection of mind enough for much argument; but you will plea&s;e to recollect that it was you who fir&s;t kindled the &s;parks of tenderne&s;s for Henry. Be&s;ides that we were brought up together, when gentle impre&s;&s;ions are ea&s;ily ad|mitted and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;ervedly avowed, you repre&s;ented him as an orphan of honour, talents, and good &s;en&s;e. I depend on every thing you &s;ay, and was charmed with a &s;entiment corre&s;pondent to my own. The affection was full grown, and had expanded into blo&s;&s;om, ere you attempted to de&s;troy, or even to check it. Then, <HI>all at once,</HI> you &s;aid you had your rea&s;ons, (which to this hour remain partly unexplained) to de&s;ire I would think no more of Henry Hammond:
<PB N="33" REF="017678_0081_0FA21F554B94DFD0">
yet, you averred, it was not fortune or any other circum&s;tance re|lating to what to the world calls <HI>a good match,</HI> that created a change in your e&s;teem. Want of <HI>worth,</HI> I am &s;ure, it <HI>could not</HI> be; and yet you &s;till per&s;i&s;t to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;uade me from attaching my&s;elf to merit, elegance, and virtue.</P>
<P>I am glad this method of addre&s;&s;ing each other by letter, though in the &s;ame hou&s;e, has, by accident, been adopted It appeared awkward at fir&s;t, but hath now the familiarity of a habit. It may well be &s;aid, in <HI>my</HI> ca&s;e, "to excu&s;e the blu&s;h, and pour out all the heart." Yet wherefore do I talk of blu&s;hing! Surely, it is not nece&s;&s;ary. I yield not to any romantic pomps of pa&s;&s;ion. I make it not a &s;ubject, where it can be likely to create one di&s;cord|ant feeling. I love with &s;implicity and truth: and it is far beyond my power&mdash;far, even as the pre&s;ervation of a &s;olemn vow is from the breach of it, to change my object but with a change of its purity. The oaths that are taken at the altar, Sir, may <HI>ratify</HI> tenderne&s;s, but cannot <HI>create</HI> it: and among&s;t the &s;ordid connecti|ons of men, it is not uncommon to be inv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ted with the public &s;anction, without ever receiving a private a&s;&s;ent from the under|&s;tanding or the heart. I do not think the law of the land, of it|&s;elf, &s;ufficient to make a woman happy. Marriage is a very hon|ourable, but it may be a very mi&s;erable in&s;titution: that is, it may produce mi&s;ery while it confers honour. The <HI>ceremony</HI> is only the <HI>&s;eal</HI> of mutual love, but the <HI>bond</HI> &s;hould be mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before; and in point of attachment I hold my&s;elf at this moment as religiou&s;ly united to Henry as if all the forms of the earth had pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d my lips in confirmation. The &s;ame idea will be lodged in my bo&s;om, whether that confirmation be remote or near. It is not intended by Heaven to be the affection of a year only. It is to la&s;t for life. It is to follow its object through all perils and dangers. Its holy ardour is to burn equally bright and pure, and nothing but death is to extingui&s;h it. Thus contracted, my father, in &s;pirit and in truth, you will ea&s;ily j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dge how light mu&s;t be the &s;acrifice of my cou&s;in's &s;trange legacy. The <HI>political</HI> tenets of Mr. Hammond have nothing to do with my friend&s;hip for him. As they have carried him into a dangerous path of life, far from <HI>me,</HI> I &s;o far de|plore them. I cho&s;e not the <HI>officer;</HI> but the <HI>man!</HI> and though it is, alas, but too unlikely that our <HI>per&s;onal</HI> intere&s;ts &s;hould be made <HI>one,</HI> yet the union of our &s;ouls is too &s;incere, and too &s;trong, for five and twenty times the conditional five thou&s;and pounds to loo&s;en or di&s;&s;olve.

<P>I HAVE a &s;u&s;picion that Mr. Hammond is wounded; let that circum&s;tance, oh my father, account to you for the horrors of mind which have for &s;ome days locked up every power of hand and of voice. The former faculty is in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored, &s;o far at lea&s;t, as tremblingly to trace upon paper &s;omething like an an|&s;wer to your affecting favour; every &s;yllable of which is as an en|venomed arrow fixing in my bo&s;om. Your determined objection then to poor Henry is at la&s;t accounted for. I thought the &s;anguine track of party was wa&s;hed wholly from a father's heart by the blood of my brother.

You both &s;eem to hug to your bo&s;oms a political Cleopatra, for who&s;e &s;ake you are willing to gain or to lo&s;e a world. England is to Henry what America is to you. Each in&s;i&s;ts that he is e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of an injured friend: and while this is the ca&s;e, how can it be expected that <HI>either</HI> &s;hould yield? In fact, would not &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion, ac|cording to the pre&s;criptions of <HI>honour,</HI> in this world's acceptation of the word, be accounted ba&s;e? You have, you &s;ay, attempted to direct the &s;word of Henry on the better &s;ide of the di&s;pute. <HI>Which is</HI> that better &s;ide? Henry declares for Britain; you for America.

El&s;e, might &s;he venture to a&s;&s;ert that your countrymen are bleeding a|broad, while the point of right and wrong is adju&s;ting at home. This, however, is clear, my dear father, from your own premi&s;es: if Henry thought him&s;elf in&s;ulted by the propo&s;al of changing his &s;ide, <HI>you</HI> would have been no le&s;s &s;tung, had a &s;imilar propo&s;ition come from <HI>him</HI> to <HI>you.</HI> And this proves, that both are acting on what is called patriotic principle. What right rea&s;on then has the one to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the other? Yet upon this di&s;plea&s;ure on your part, you urge me to withdraw my vows.

When affection is fa&s;hioned by the feelings, and long cheri&s;hed in a &s;oul which nei|ther projects nor practi&s;es any ill, who&s;e every thought is &s;ubmitted to the holy critici&s;m of Heaven, nor ever dreads the &s;crutiny &mdash; is it, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, of a texture &s;o convenient, as to &s;hift from &s;ide to &s;ide with every gale of opinion? Wherefore, let me once again tenderly enquire, wherefore did you originally in|&s;pire me with a veneration for &s;ober rea&s;on? why infu&s;e in me a &s;teady and generous way of thinking? Was it de&s;igned for orna|ment or for u&s;e?

<HEAD><HI>MOMUS;</HI> or the <HI>LAUGHING PHILOSOPHER.</HI> The <HI>HUMOURS</HI> of a <HI>WET SUNDAY,</HI> near <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING dined with a friend a few Sundays ago, at his villa within a few miles of London, I was, on my return home, overtaken by a violent &s;hower, and obliged to put up at the fir&s;t public hou&s;e I met with upon the road. While I was there watch|ing the weather from a window, that I might &s;eize a favourable moment to pur&s;ue my journey, without being in a dripping con|dition, I was not a little amu&s;ed with a collection of draggled fe|males; who, with their loving hu&s;bands, &amp;c. were driven, by the torrents pouring upon their heads, to &s;helter them&s;elves under the &s;ame roof.</P>
<P>"Lord have mercy upon me!" exclaimed a woman of the larg|e&s;t &s;ize, and rendered &s;till more weighty by her corpulence, "Lord have mercy upon me!" wiping her face, which &s;hone like a cook-maid's, with her apron, "I am &s;ure this is making a toil of a plea&s;ure; here we labour and take pains all the week, on purpo&s;e to have a little comfort on a Sunday, and now you &s;ee, I &s;hall &s;poil every <HI>individual</HI> thing about me; be&s;ides, I am &s;o fatigued into the bargain: but I told my hu&s;band this very morning, that I would never &s;et out again without a coach, or <HI>&s;hay,</HI> or &s;omething to car|ry me."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="017678_0092_0FA21F62449A3900">"You're in the right of it," replied her friend, a tall, raw-boned woman, with her mouthful of pins, with which &s;he was en|deavouring to pin up her petticoat; "I am &s;ure, I will not &s;lave my&s;elf to death again for all the plea&s;ure upon earth; and yet I'll not &s;it at home all day neither."</P>
<P>"What's that you won't do?" &s;aid a poor meagre, half &s;tarved fellow, who was by this time come up to them with a heavy child on each arm. "I am &s;ure you have not the rea&s;on to complain I have, who have carried the boys &s;o many miles; &mdash; you are never &s;atisfied; but you &s;hall carry them your&s;elf the re&s;t of the way, or leave them behind."</P>
<P>Here, being hardly able to &s;tand with his incumbrances, he was going to throw off his load; &mdash; his rib then called out to him in a rai&s;ed, but not in a very melodious voice, "Don't offer to &s;et my children down, don't, I &s;ay; do you think I will have their coats wetted, and their frocks dirtied? Who mu&s;t clean them? Not you, I &s;uppo&s;e, you will tell me, like a &s;neaking devil as you are; but come what will, plea&s;e God, you &s;hall &s;tand at the wa&s;h tub till you drop; for I will &s;ee them all <HI>got up,</HI> to cure you of drag|ging me home upon my feet: and now we are brought into this precious pickle, I wonder what is to become of us."</P>
<P>"Oh, (replied her unwieldly neighbour) we mu&s;t &s;tay till we can light of a coach; and in the mean time let us call for &s;ome|thing.&mdash;What do you like be&s;t, Ma'm?"</P>
<P>"You may call for what you plea&s;e, (an&s;wered the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed hu&s;band, interrupting her) but then you mu&s;t pay for it, as I have not a &s;ingle &s;ixpence left out of my whole week's wages &mdash; 'tis all gone."</P>
<P>"Gone?" cries his glamorous lady; "gone? Why, then, if we <HI>&s;hould</HI> have the good luck to meet with a <HI>&s;hay</HI> or a coach, we mu&s;t be wet to the &s;kin, becau&s;e you have no money to pay for it."</P>
<P>"No; but <HI>you</HI> have," replied he, "for I gave you every penny that I received la&s;t right, and did not even keep back enough for a &s;ingle pot of porter: I am &s;ure, I drank nothing but Adam's ale after my bread and chee&s;e before I went to bed, which has made me as weak as a rat."</P>
<P>"Weak?" &s;aid &s;he, "weak with drinking water? That's a <HI>good one,</HI> indeed! I am &s;ure there is not a whole&s;omer liquor in the world."</P>
<P>"Then I wonder, my dear," an&s;wered he, with an arch look, "that <HI>you</HI> drink &s;o much &s;trong beer your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I drink &s;trong beer? Aye, and &s;o I do, or el&s;e how &s;hould I be able to &s;uckle my two twins, God help me! As women go through &s;o much in this world, they had need of &s;omething to &s;up|port them; but men are always grudging them, and taking every thing for them&s;elves."</P>
<P>"Zounds! what ails the woman," exclaimed the provoked hu&s;|band, "with her grudging? Didn't I give you all?"</P>
<P>"Yes, and then went and run up a long &s;core at the <HI>Black Dog</HI>; &s;o we &s;hall not have a farthing left to pay our rent."</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="017678_0093_0FA21F6336C6A8C8">"Why, we cannot eat our cake and have it," &s;aid he; "you wanted to come a plea&s;uring, and let's hear no more about it."</P>
<P>The waiter now made his appearance with a bowl of punch, and a plate of cold boiled beef; and by &s;o doing put a &s;top to their al|tercation, as they all fell to as if they had not eaten a mor&s;el that day, they had dined very heartily upon a fillet of veal, and a gam|mon of bacon, and greens, at an <HI>Ordinary</HI> at <HI>Hammer&s;mith,</HI> and di&s;patched a large quantity of &s;tout beer, with a pot of tea, and &s;everal plates of bread and butter.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent refre&s;hment put them into a tolerable humour. The mother of the twins took them by turns to the brea&s;t, while the father of them &s;at down in the corner of the room to re&s;t him&s;elf till the rain was over.</P>
<P>When he began to think of &s;etting off for the capital, the huge-wai&s;ted lady &s;aid to his wife, in a whi&s;per, "If you will lend me enough to di&s;charge the reckoning, I will treat in return next Sun|day."</P>
<P>While this affair was agitating in one part of the room, a &s;mart altercation was carried on in another, between a lover and his mi&s;tre&s;s, who had ju&s;t been caught in the &s;hower, and were dry|ing them&s;elves over a pot of coffee. The lady was dre&s;t in the very extremity of the fa&s;hion; her hair was &s;tretched to above twice the length of her face; her hat was quite narrow before, and im|men&s;ely broad behind; her <HI>Polone&s;e</HI> was tied up with the mo&s;t ele|gant air imaginable; and &s;he had a pretty little foot ju&s;t covered with a white &s;lipper with a purple ro&s;e, heel, and binding. &mdash; <HI>He</HI> had his hand on her &s;houlder, and <HI>&s;he</HI> was putting &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ugar into his cup, when a returned po&s;t-chai&s;e drove up to the door. "There is a carriage," &s;aid &s;he bri&s;kly, "let us &s;ecure it."&mdash;Away ran he, but &s;oon came b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck. "Well," &s;aid the lady, "will he wait?" "Wait!" replied the lover; "I did not a&s;k him, as he will not carry us to London under half a guinea; he is no common driver, it is a Lord's carriage." "Well, and if my Lord was here," an|&s;wered &s;he, "he would be happy to have my company upon any terms; and &s;o you have let him go, rather than give &s;uch a paltry &s;um to accommodate <HI>me</HI>; but I &s;hall not walk, I a&s;&s;ure you, nor draggle my petticoats like the wives of your dirty mechanics, I did not attach my&s;elf to <HI>you,</HI> but to enjoy all the plea&s;ures of life; yet you are &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly mean, as to deny me the common con|veniencies: but I will leave you&mdash;I could not be u&s;ed wor&s;e if I was married." &mdash;Here &s;he flounced out of the room, and I pre&s;ently &s;aw her drive off with an officer in his <HI>phaeton,</HI> in which &s;he certainly mu&s;t have been half drowned, as the rain continued to come down with great violence; and the captain was too genteel to have a top to his chai&s;e, out of which &s;he was afterwards thrown by his driv|ing too near a po&s;t ju&s;t at the entrance into London, by which acci|dent both her leg and arm were broken.</P>
<P>The curious <HI>trio</HI> above mentioned having thoroughly lined their in&s;ides, &s;et out on foot, and became quite regardle&s;s of their out|&s;ides; but their expences had been &s;o heavy, and the reparations

of the damages which their cloaths had &s;u&s;tained made &s;uch breach|es in their pockets, that they were obliged not only to work harder than u&s;ual during the following week, but to deny them&s;elves &s;ome of the lowe&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life; yet all their labour and oeconomy would not enable them to make an other excur&s;ion when the next <HI>Sunday</HI> arrived; and as that Sunday happened to be a remarkably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne one, they &s;pent it in quarrelling &mdash;becau&s;e they could not <HI>en|joy</HI> it, by <HI>abu&s;ing</HI> it.</P>

<HEAD>AN EXTRAORDINARY LOVE-LETTER, From <HI>Mr. PETER PLAINMAN</HI> to <HI>Mi&s;s PRISCILLA PRUDISH.</HI> [Taken from a genuine Copy.]</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a little afraid you and I &s;hall never come together. There is that expectation of flattery about you that I cannot bear. Yet as I love you well enough to be hone&s;t &mdash; a bold word that &mdash; I will once for all &s;peak my mind, and I de&s;ire your attention. I believe I do not admire you or value you for any one of tho&s;e charms for which you admire and value your&s;elf. I do not, for in&s;tance pay any adoration to the pre&s;ent brightne&s;s of your eyes, becau&s;e I am &s;o &s;trange a fellow as to con&s;ider them philo&s;ophical<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. They are very brilliant, to be &s;ure; but what are they? What are they, Madam, <HI>ab origine?</HI> Fops, Fools, and Poets would, in their u&s;ual airy manner, tell you, that they were made of cele&s;|tial fire, that they were two animated balls of beauty, two love-darting mirrors formed by the graces, and a pack of &s;uch fluff: But I &s;corn to figure away at the expence of fair truth. I write in hone&s;t pro&s;e, Madam, and therefore in hone&s;t pro&s;e I tell you, that tho&s;e &s;ame balls of etherial beauty, tho&s;e &s;ame love-darting mirrors, are at be&s;t two pieces of ordinary clay varni&s;hed. The varni&s;h, I allow, is good, and well put on; thanks to the &s;ound health of the father that begot you, and the mother who bore you; But what of all this? I am not &s;uch a &s;hort-&s;ighted, amorous pup|py, but I can look forward alittle beyond the length of my no&s;e, to the time when the glo&s;s will all be worn away, when the japan of Nature will be utterly gone, and the devil a &s;park of fire will you have about you. If you live long enough, you will be purblind, and then what becomes of your love-darters? Don't be quite &s;o vain, my young beauty. Another mighty matter upon which you have, it &s;eems, to pique your&s;elf, is your face; I mean &s;uch things as we call cheeks, lips, and complexion. I wi&s;h it to be known to you, that I have but a very poor opinion of the&s;e divine graces, as you call them. Some time ago, I remember you &s;hewed me, in a great air of triumph, a paper &s;crawled upon by &s;ome &s;torid puppy of your acquaintance, who &s;wore, in very &s;orry ver&s;es, that your cheeks threw into utter de&s;pair all the lillies and ro&s;es in the crea|tion; your &s;kin too, was, if I recollect, poli&s;hed marble; the veins were compared to the azure of the third Heaven, and the colour was whiter than alaba&s;ter. 'Tis a lie, PRISCILLA, 'tis a &s;ad lie;
<PB N="47" REF="017678_0095_0FA21F64C590E570">
you are indebted to poetical fiction for all this tra&s;h: the rogues who deal in it have, as they tell us, a licence from that &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly fellow APOLLO, to play &s;uch pranks with idle girls and boys who believe them. For my part, I never could be taken in by the tag of a rhime, nor the cadence of a couplet, nor the tran&s;po&s;ition of ten &s;aucy &s;yllables, &s;ince I was born; I always looked upon them as mere ear-traps. What a collection of fal&s;ities is here, indeed! I never &s;aw a pair of cheeks in my life, that were fairer than a lilly, nor a pair of lips that were redder than a ro&s;e. As to alaba&s;ter, I will take upon me to &s;ay, there never was a woman's &s;kin half &s;o white in the whole world; and I &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee a com|plexion &s;o well poli&s;hed as a piece of Egyptian marble. No, no; the&s;e flights won't pa&s;s upon men of cool pro&s;e. They won't in|deed, PRISCILLA; upon my &s;oul they won't. Metaphor, meta|phor, my dear, is a mere bam; it tickles the child's ear; but I heartily de&s;pi&s;e it. Not but that I give to a fine form its proper portion of prai&s;e. I am perfectly &s;en&s;ible to hand&s;ome features&punc; I like to &s;ee the proper proportions of red and white: I am very well plea&s;ed with a &s;parkling pair of eyes; but I have no idea of calling any of the&s;e what they really are not, nor of comparing them with objects to which they have no likene&s;s whatever. For in&s;tance now, your bo&s;om is &s;aid to be purer than the driven &s;now: If that isn't carrying the je&s;t as far as it will fairly go, I don't know what is. Snow, quoth'e&mdash; Why, Madam, if a &s;now-ball and your bo&s;om were &s;hewn together, and any thing in the world but a poet to be the judge, he would &s;ay that you were a &s;warthy gip|&s;ey in the compari&s;on. But how you ladies can be plea&s;ed with all this high flying is to me a&s;toni&s;hing,&mdash;Zoon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Pri&s;cilla, how can this be? If a man was to compare me to a &s;tick or a &s;tone, or a tree or a plant, that I was no more like than I am like the main ocean, &s;hould I perk up my head, and look about me the more for that? As to features, &s;kin, complexion, &amp;c. they are &s;o tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> things of today, that if I was a woman, I &s;hould be afraid to put any tru&s;t in them. They have more enemies than the ever-per|&s;ecuted have. I could recount &s;uch a catalogue as would make

<L>Like quills upon the fretful por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pine.</L></Q>
Go into your garden &mdash; fix your attention on the faire&s;t flower&punc; take care that it is in the luxuriance of its bloom. Did you ever behold tints more exqui&s;ite, &s;collops more exact, colours better mixed, or beauties better varied? Now leave it. Pay it a &s;econd vi&s;it to morrow morning. What are you &s;urpri&s;ed at? That a flower &s;hould fade! A &s;light bla&s;t of wind in the night hath whol|ly de&s;troyed it; the tints are dead; the colours are faded; the beauty is no more. Step now to your toilette. Indeed, Pri&s;cilla, you are very pretty: What a face, what an air, what a &s;hape! In the evening one of the thou&s;and enemies of hand&s;ome features overtakes you, and your &s;econd vi&s;it to the mirror &s;hews&mdash; an ugly woman. I believe you have wit enough to &s;ee whereto all this tends&mdash; it tends, Pri&s;cilla, to your in&s;truction. I would not have

I heard you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in &s;uch raptures of a new coach, and new diamonds, that I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch afraid you are far gone in the <HI>frippe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies</HI> of life. A &s;light fever would &s;oon &s;hew you the impotency of gold, and it would dive&s;t of all the trappings in which you have wantonly dre&s;&s;ed the fine&s;t fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of hor&s;es in the univer&s;e.

I think I could bani&s;h the frailties that cling at pre&s;ent about your affections. If you can bear me after this letter, I &s;hall have a better opinion of you than ever: If you are offended, and take pet at it, I &s;hall lo&s;e you, it is true; but then I &s;hall know by experience, that your love was not worth &s;eeking. I know we &s;hould live very happy together, if you would but comply with my terms. They are neither difficult nor various: 1&s;t. Break your looking gla&s;s. 2d. Turn all your poets out of doors. 3dly. Throw their ver&s;es into the fire; and, la&s;tly, Make a &s;olemn vow never more to put your tru&s;t in <HI>metaphors</HI> and <HI>compari&s;ons,</HI> two cur&s;ed things which have done more injury to young women than libertini&s;m it&s;elf. What &s;ay you, will you agree to the&s;e conditions, and take to your bo&s;om, without ei|ther lace on his coat, poetry in his head, or <HI>puppyi&s;m</HI> at his heart,</P>

<P>UNgrateful Emma! perver&s;e and in&s;en&s;ate child! You merit neither the pangs you co&s;t me, nor the tenderne&s;s you re|ceive from me, I gave you a rea&s;on cogent enough to have weaned a <HI>worthy</HI> girl from a thou&s;and Hammonds. To that I might have added the &s;udden departure of a generous friend, who I <HI>now</HI> tell you (for I <HI>can</HI> hold no longer) would have laid his fortune at your feet. This, indeed, you mu&s;t have &s;een, &s;ince nothing but the mo&s;t extreme &s;tupidity could remain ignorant of tho&s;e attentions which, for many weeks pa&s;t, have been lavi&s;hed upon you by Sir Robert Raymond, a man, oh incon&s;iderate! who &s;aved thy aged father in the very cri&s;is of his misfortunes; and, too delicate to de|mand as a debt the tender returns of love, which he would have &s;ued for as a favour, is gone, almo&s;t broken-hearted, away. I had promi&s;ed to <HI>conceal</HI> his confidence, but you extort it from me: nay, you continue &s;till to doat upon the wretch who is fighting again&s;t all the be&s;t and deare&s;t connexions of your family. I will not en|dure it. You a&s;&s;ume the language of deci&s;ion, and call it the &s;en|timent of rea&s;on. You &s;et your&s;elf up as a judge, and lift your wo|man's voice again&s;t the &s;acred principles of patriot and parent. It is not to be borne. Let me hear no more on the &s;ubject. Cea&s;e your threats about daggers, darts, and death. I look DOWN upon &s;uch romance. Forbear to urge me. You are not to learn the touches of my temper. <HI>My principles</HI> are not le&s;s &s;acred than <HI>your pa&s;&s;ion. Your</HI> principles! What are they? Airy nothings. <HI>Mine</HI> are the &s;olemn af|fections of a lover of his country, and a dete&s;ter of its oppre&s;&s;ors, a <HI>aete&s;ter of Henry Hammond!</HI> Why will you drive me to this?

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CLAIM the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a man whom I know to be generous, who honours me with his e&s;teem, and whom I venerate for the ancient friend&s;hip that has long united our families. By the pow|erful force of <HI>all</HI> the&s;e feelings, I conjure you, on the receipt of this letter, to vi&s;it my father. A&s;&s;ure him that his dear, dear image lives unimpaired in my heart. Tell him that my ab&s;enting my&s;elf in this manner is not the truant trick of a girl who triumphs in the vexation of a parent, but proceeds from a motive mo&s;t virtuous, mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;table, mo&s;t con&s;cientious &mdash; from a duty that appeals to my heart, my &s;en&s;es, and my &s;oul. O let him not think that I <HI>glory</HI> in the nece&s;&s;ity which takes me one moment from <HI>him.</HI> I la|ment, I weep, I mourn over it. I could wi&s;h that each duty went hand in hand, and that &s;ome of their objects did not lie &s;o wide apart from others. Superior to every deceit, I would have con&s;ulted my father even on the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure, but he will recol|lect the terror into which his late conver&s;ations threw me, and will then be convinced how impo&s;&s;ible it was to ri&s;que &s;uch an ecclair|ci&s;&s;ment&punc; Yet even now I will forbear to ju&s;tify my departure, becau&s;e I would &s;uffer &s;ome reproach my&s;elf, rather than try to e&s;tabli&s;h an irregular example. But the Power who is giving me &s;trength to &s;u&s;tain the great bu&s;ine&s;s I am about to undertake, has placed in my bo&s;om &s;omething which reconciles me to the enter|prize. Oh Sir Robert, there is a duty which <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be performed&mdash; at lea&s;t attempted. Nature, rea&s;on, honour, and faith the mo&s;t hallowed, all &s;tir within me; nay God him&s;elf, at the marking of who&s;e awful name I bow, &s;eems looking down from his heaven of heavens with approbation. I may &s;eem to be romantic, when I mean only to &s;hew my&s;elf &s;incere. All &s;ort of re&s;earch will be vain, I would not have yielded to the lea&s;t &s;emblance of a &s;cheme, which is mo&s;t terrible to my nature, could it by any means have been avoided. My father will call to mind certain &s;entiments, and do me ju&s;tice in his own dear bo&s;om on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Raymond, I ever de&s;ired to be uniform, and to re|concile the di&s;tinct parts of my conduct with the whole.

<P>YOUR letter, Sir Robert, with its dear and dreadful inclo&s;ure, came to hand. It is now before my eyes, which are &s;tream|ing in penitence for the phrenzy which has bani&s;hed my daughter. I now behold the whole matter too plain. Oh, my friend, I treat|ed the mo&s;t dutiful of children with unwonted har&s;hne&s;s, and in the patriot I extingui&s;hed the parent. I expected that a &s;oul like Emma's &s;hould circum&s;cribe it&s;elf within the pale of politics. Cur&s;e on the rage of party! Execrated be the tyrannies of war. Ah what are cau&s;es, countries, worlds, to the lo&s;s of one dear child, adorned with the virtues of Emma Corbett &mdash; Blind, doating zeal: what ha&s;t thou to do with an old man's heart? What, with the &s;acred &s;ea&s;on of the &s;ilver hair? Is mine an age to engage in the&s;e tumultuous &s;ubjects? No. I &s;hould have taken my darling daughter to my bo&s;om, and with an enlarged benevolence prayed fervently for the returning embrace of a divided people. <HI>That</HI> would have been true patrioti&s;m and true philanthropy. In&s;tead of which, dolt and dotard as I was, I mixed with hot-headed gid|dine&s;s in the affray.

Behold Raymond, how I am puni&s;hed! But where, where all this time is Emma? No date! No addre&s;s!

<HEAD>LETTER CXI. E. CORBETT TO HIS FATHER.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having been thirteen months agonized among&s;t the wounded, and more than once con&s;idered as the prize of death, I am at length able to write a few lines to acquaint you that I exi&s;t; by which information, I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall make a father, a &s;i&s;ter, and a friend, mo&s;t happy. The arm and &s;houl|der, which were wounded, are at length cured without amputation&punc; but the half of the left cheek is gone. The&s;e tidings I had cau&s;ed to be conveyed to England long &s;ince, by letters &s;ent at different op|portunities, by various means of conveyance; but as I have not re|ceived your replies, I fear either tho&s;e mi&s;carried, or mine have never reached you. Indeed, war puts a dreadful &s;top to this branch of communication, although the only one which can re|lieve the pains of &s;o perilous an ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON offers me the means of future retreat and inacti|vity, in con&s;ideration, I &s;uppo&s;e, of my &s;cars. But I am now too far engaged to accept this with any honour. I wi&s;h it may be no more nece&s;&s;ary to fire; and they <HI>talk</HI> indeed of peace, but there is no real pro&s;pect of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing being at hand. I fought, at fir&s;t, in my own defence, and mu&s;t, I fear, continue to do &s;o &s;till. The Engli&s;h per&s;i&s;t to call tho&s;e cowards whom they prove to be men, and feel to be heroes.

<P>Wherefore does my old friend Henry &s;tay idling at home,

Why does he not take one &s;ide or the other, as principle directs? He was wont to maintain with me warm di&s;putes in favour of Great-Britain, but by this time his opinion mu&s;t be changed, and the cau&s;e of America mu&s;t be dear to him, were it only in re&s;pect of her youth, her bravery, and her misfortunes. Tell him I &s;hould be glad to receive him here &mdash; to receive him, in that ca&s;e, as a brother; and on tho&s;e conditions, too, we will both return one day or another, and enjoy the fruits of a double marriage; for notwith&s;tanding your re&s;i&s;tance, my father, I mu&s;t &s;till remind you that I have a heart only for Loui&s;a.

<HEAD>SECOND INCLOSURE FROM SIR R. RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>CORBETT, the &s;eal of Providence is &s;urely upon my enter|prize! Oh happy chance! I have at once &s;aved and re&s;|cued your daughter. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea&s;ed God to carry me into the &s;ame place of confinement, where I found her mingled with the multi|tude of our unhappy countrymen. A violent &s;hriek upon my en|trance betrayed her to me. Her man's apparel became no longer a veil to hide her from eyes &s;o familiar with her voice and her fea|tures. She fainted in my arms.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners were too much involved in the &s;ullen gloom of their own melancholy to regard the di&s;tre&s;s of another. The paper which I inclo&s;e, &s;potted as you &s;ee, with drops of blood from her own lovely arm, fell from her bo&s;om. By the time &s;he recovered, one of the officers who had guarded us approached.&mdash; She look|ed at him a moment (it being the fir&s;t time &s;he had &s;een him &s;ince he came in) and then &s;unk without any appearance of life upon the floor. She lay as a corp&s;e.</P>
<P>Oh merciful Heaven! &mdash; Oh God, great and gracious God! cried the officer, it is &mdash; it is &mdash; it mu&s;t be Emma &mdash; it mu&s;t be my SISTER.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently, Emma and Edward Corbett (for it was your &s;on, my friend) were both embracing upon their knees.</P>
<P>It was no time to explain. She was moved out of the pri&s;on. I was permitted to attend. Edward Corbett in his own arms con|veyed her to an apartment. He obtained leave of ab&s;ence from the farther duties of the day. He was the nur&s;e of your poor Emma. Oh, Mr. Corbett, I was not idle.</P>
<P>Wa&s;hington happened to be quartered at the &s;ame town, prepar|ing the manoeuvres of a new attack. He is ea&s;y of acce&s;s; and be|ing at liberty on a parole of honour, I gained an interview.</P>

The General heard the &s;tory of her love as I related it. I concealed no part from him but that which had reference to my own former folly. I brought the narrative down to the moment of reciting it. The &s;oldier's cheek was not without the graceful dignity of a tear. He wept.</P>
<P>Sacred, &s;aid he, be the rights of ho&s;pitality: I am not at war with the <HI>affections.</HI> Ever privileged be <HI>their</HI> emotions. I feel them all. The beauteous pri&s;oner is at liberty, Sir Robert, to go where &s;he plea&s;es.

<P>I flew to Edward Corbett with the tidings. Emma had by this time acquainted him with her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>At what a moment did I enter the room! Your &s;on was pro|nouncing, or rather <HI>attempting</HI> to pronounce, the names of wife and parent, of Loui&s;a and his little Edward. And have I then the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, (cried he) and is my father <HI>yet</HI> in ignorance what claims, what doubly tender claims, Loui&s;a Corbett hath upon him? He then pre&s;&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter in his arms, and they wept together.</P>
<P>Surprizes came too fa&s;t upon the haple&s;s youth. He knew not that Henry was under arms. He did not know that he was an enemy. Yet he dropped for a while the fiercene&s;s of the &s;oldier, and acted as a man &mdash; as the child of nature &mdash; as the hu&s;band of Loui&s;a, and the brother of Emma. Then go, my &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, your career is too glorious to be checked. In contemplating your conduct, I ri&s;e above all the prejudices of party.

<P>Oh &s;acred force of &s;overeign tenderne&s;s! Emma has tidings of her Henry. Our enquiries have at length terminated in &s;ucce&s;s. He is now with his regiment off John's Town. Thither we are bending our cour&s;e with the utmo&s;t expedition. I &s;end you not the minutiae of intervening adventures. They yield to enterpri|zes of greater moment. We are within one day's journey of the place.</P>
<P>By Heavens, Corbett, the ro&s;es are &s;uddenly thrown over the cheek of your child, and the pale of fatigue and &s;ickne&s;s, and lo&s;s of blood, (which has not been incon&s;iderable) all give way to the joyful expectation of &s;eeing her Henry.</P>
<P>Surely it requires only a generous effort to turn our di&s;appoint|ments to amiable account. To conquer affection is not, I feel, always po&s;&s;ible; but to direct it from one worthy path into ano|ther, when the former is unfit or unju&s;t, is a&s;&s;uredly in our power. Henry him&s;elf cannot adore Emma more &s;incerely than my&s;elf. My whole heart is her's; oft it trembles, oft it bleeds, but the choice either to be the object of e&s;teem or the object of aver&s;ion is before me. Oh! I would not forfeit the partial &s;entiment which my conduct has lodged in the brea&s;t of Emma, for any other earth|ly enjoyment. She owns me for her friend, her <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of friends She talks to me without re&s;erve. She looks at me &s;ometimes till the heart's &s;oft tear is in her eye. Ah, that tear! it is more worth than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the reluctant beauty that ever gold, gran|deur, or importunity, extorted into their arms. I feel it &s;tream over my &s;en&s;es. Ble&s;&s;ed &s;ympathy! Pure effu&s;ion! Generous, glorious Emma!</P>
<P>I am penciling the&s;e informations of our route, &s;ometimes in the vehicle and &s;ometimes in a room.</P>
<P>Emma has this moment de&s;ired the driver to &s;top. The door of the chai&s;e is open; &s;he jumps out, &s;aying to me in a whi&s;per, that a lucky thought &s;trikes her.</P>

<P>God of all goodne&s;s! did&s;t thou ever create another Emma?</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing along, &s;he took note of &s;ome bu&s;hes which were cover|ed thickly with a dun coloured berry that clu&s;tered in the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dge-rows. I a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in gathering the&s;e without daring to a&s;k for information as to cau&s;es. She hath an air of intreaty which cuts &s;hort all curio&s;ity about motive, and leaves us no other &s;olicitude than that of gratifying her by implicit obedience.</P>
<P>I knew not the de&s;ign of Emma in picking the berries till the evening, and <HI>then</HI> &s;he explained to me their u&s;e.</P>

It re&s;embled almo&s;t ex|actly the hue of &s;ome of the &s;avages whom we had ob&s;erved to be wounded in a town through which we pa&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>I &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t Henry, I &s;hall touch his dear hand, and attend him in every danger, without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing him by &s;urprize, or di&s;arming him by &s;oftne&s;s.

<HEAD>LETTER CXXV. TO C. CORBETT, <HI>E&s;q.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Henry Hammond.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THAT paragon of her &s;ex, your daughter! That man too, &s;oaring above the flight of humanity, who attended her as the companion of all her perils, all her pangs! The writer of this letter (or more properly &s;peaking, the per&s;on by whom this letter is dictated) is at a lo&s;s by what means, or in what language, to convey to you the wonders which yet he is mo&s;t anxious to im|part.</P>
<P>By gentle degrees &mdash; oh, Mr. Corbett, let me open upon you the ble&s;&s;ings which&punc; by the contrivance of Providence, have been brought about, Summon your heart to hear the be&s;t, the deare&s;t news which is in the nature of human things for you to hear. O let the agony of <HI>that</HI> information, which Sir Robert Raymond's letter has doubtle&s;s produced, be, in great mea&s;ure, done away, by the happier tidings that will &s;alute you in this.</P>
<P>The <HI>hand writing</HI> of the per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n now dictating would too much di&s;compo&s;e you. He makes u&s;e, therefore, of an amanuen&s;is to prepare the way to circum&s;tances of uncommon joy; and to give them to you in the &s;ecurity of more progre&s;&s;ive explanation.</P>
<P>The leading &s;tep to every other felicity you mu&s;t hear <HI>fir&s;t</HI> You, who have deeply drank of the bitter cup, mu&s;t now try to &s;upport, without intoxication, the ta&s;te of &s;weeter ingredients.</P>
<P>From the point of death, your Emma has recovered. The in|terpo&s;ing hand of Heaven was <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> extended.</P>
<P>Ten days after the departure of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Robert's packet, &s;he was in a &s;ituation to leave her bed. To what <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> did &s;he leave it? Re&s;olution, oh how &s;acred is thy force, when animated by the breath of love!</P>
<P>If Henry be dead, &s;aid &s;he, it is &s;till the duty of Emma to pay him the mournful offices which &s;he has paid to Edward.</P>
<P>She in&s;i&s;ted on &s;earching for the corp&s;e of the man who had cau&s;ed all her misfortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="017678_0120_0FA21E98297284F8">The generous Sir Robert Raymond was at that time him&s;elf con|fined by &s;ickne&s;s which threatened his life: &mdash; when he was out of danger, Emma gave him in tendere&s;t charge, and &s;at out, alone, towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e woods where &s;ome late &s;kirmi&s;hes had pa&s;&s;ed. On her way &s;he had the precaution to u&s;e again tho&s;e berries which tinge the &s;kin: to the&s;e &s;he added a certain ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k that had been mentioned to her in the cour&s;e of her various enquiries.</P>
<P>Behold, oh Mr. Corbett, behold the dear and delicate Emma, wandering unprotected, in the woods of America. &mdash; Behold her bearing over her tender &s;houlder the mere nece&s;&s;aries of decent covering. &mdash; Behold the mo&s;t gentle, and mo&s;t female form expo&s;ed to all the dangers of a wild and unknown country &mdash; picking her food from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">edges &mdash; &s;traying &s;he knew not whither &mdash; in di&s;|gui&s;e &mdash; in di&s;order &mdash; in de&s;pair!</P>
<P>Incredible were the toils of her re&s;earch &mdash; incredible her fatigue. The fore&s;ts are here, you know, of great extent: the wilds immea|&s;ureable.</P>
<P>After &s;everal days travelling, during which time &s;he had not en|countered any pa&s;&s;enger who could give her the lea&s;t intelligence, &s;he &s;at her&s;elf down as u&s;ual, about the noon, and wept over her misfortunes.</P>
<P>Scarce had &s;he re&s;ted a moment, ere the clamour of human voices, &s;houting at a &s;mall di&s;tance, caught her attention. She pre&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily forward through the foliage, and ob&s;erved at a little aper|ture in the fore&s;t, a par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of &s;oldiers engaging with a tribe of In|dians; but while &s;he was eagerly examining the per&s;ons of the <HI>former,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> were put to flight, and retreated with the utmo&s;t precipitation: the &s;oldiers pur&s;ued, and both were out of &s;ight er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Emma had time to approach nearer to them.</P>
<P>She &s;aw enough, however, to convince her that the regimentals were Briti&s;h, and the uniform of the officers &s;uch as belonged to the regiment of Henry; you will gue&s;s her de&s;pair when &s;he did not perceive Henry among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The bodies of &s;everal Engli&s;h &s;oldiers were &s;een in different parts of the fore&s;t, but the corp&s;e of Hammond could, by no diligence, be found.</P>
<P>Still indefatigable, &s;he went on, though by this time reduced almo&s;t to the la&s;t exigencies of nature, and every thing &s;ubdued but tender re&s;olution, and the love which in&s;pired it.</P>
<P>At length, Providence relented to her wi&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and directed her &s;teps to a bread common path way, acro&s;s which was ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a human figure, lying as dead, with an arrow &s;ticking in his bo&s;om. You already perceive, that it was no other than <HI>Henry him&s;elf.</HI> This, you <HI>may</HI> perceive, but no tongue can give you the fainte&s;t idea of that unparalleled heroi&s;m and fidelity, which now in&s;pired the &s;oul of Emma! She found the body yet warm, the pul&s;e &s;lowly moving, and the heart languidly bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h life. She extracted, the arrow, and &s;ucked the wound &mdash; &s;he had heard of the Indians u&s;ing &s;hafts who&s;e points were envenomed: and right|ly concluding <HI>this</HI> to be one of them, applied to it her lovely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ips

without he&s;itation.&mdash;This additional danger was an additional mo|tive to the deed. Oh Mr. Corbett, what an angel is Emma!</P>
<P>Signs of exi&s;tence increa&s;ed. With &s;carce a covering from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, the affectionate Emma &s;heltered her unfortunate charge for many days. Ere his &s;en&s;es returned, &s;he thickened her di&s;gui&s;e by all the arts in her power. Oh can any thing le&s;s eloquent than the great Author of Nature de&s;cribe to you the tran&s;port of this wondrous creature, when &s;he fir&s;t beheld the long clo&s;ed eye of Henry open on the light &mdash; and open on her&s;elf?</P>
<P>Think, Mr. Corbett, how difficult <HI>concealment</HI> mu&s;t have been at this extatic moment; then, con&s;ider what pre&s;ence of mind was nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;s the dear and dangerous effu&s;ion. The &s;ilver tones of the &s;ofte&s;t voice in the world were &s;o artfully changed, as to corre&s;pond with the re&s;t of her appearance. She fed him with what the fortune of an hour's hunti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g among&s;t the fruits of the fo|re&s;t afforded. He could not move. No &s;oldiers returned. Men drop in a &s;kirmish, and are &s;ought for no more! No hou&s;e was near: no hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: and &s;he dared not &s;tray too far from the place where he lay, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e &s;ight of the &s;pot. But now Henry felt the puncture of a want which even Emma could not accommodate. Fruits and vegetables, collected by chance, as they grew obvious, and within the beat of Emma's journeyings, were too un&s;ub&s;tanti|al. It &s;eemed as if famine would compleat what poi&s;on had begun. For lack of proper nutriment, after fatigues &s;o imminent, he was reduced to an extreme of languor even wor&s;e than that of Emma; whom tenderne&s;s &s;eemed to have rendered &s;uperior to every thing that could befall her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the&s;e moments it was that Henry yielded to de&s;pair &mdash; in the&s;e moments his heart melted with gratitude to his protector &mdash;</P>
<P>Oh, generous unknown, (&s;aid he feebly) who&s;oever thou art, receive the dying acknowledgments of the man whom thou ha&s;t endeavoured to re&s;cue from an untimely death.

<P>Here he fell on the bo&s;om of Emma, and would <HI>indeed</HI> have di|ed had he known it was Emma that &s;upported him.</P>
<P>She pre&s;&s;ed his hand. She could not &s;peak. To the Omnipo|tent Father of Mercy &s;he ca&s;t the imploring eye!</P>

<P>A team now pa&s;&s;ed within fight of this di&s;con&s;olate pair. They were laden with provi&s;ions and apparel drawn in fledges, and &s;mall waggons, and were on their way to three detachments of &s;oldiers, (who had applied to the General for the&s;e accomodations) that were &s;tationed on the north &s;ide of the fore&s;t. Among&s;t this groupe were al&s;o &s;ome cattle, of which &s;ome were cows. It is un|nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay what u&s;e the unwearied Emma made of the&s;e: her winning addre&s;s, and the moving &s;implicity of her grief, joined to the wretched &s;ituation of an Engli&s;h officer who appeared to be al|mo&s;t at the point of death, gained &s;o entirely upon the &s;oldiers and people who attended the fledges and waggons, that they admini&s;|tered whatever could promote the wi&s;h of Emma, and even fur|ni&s;hed her with a fledge, a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, and a guide, to carry Captain Hammond to John's-Town.</P>
<P>Thus providentially &s;aved from death a <HI>&s;econd</HI> time, I &s;hall not trouble you with other difficulties in the pa&s;&s;age, or in the progre&s;s of Henry's recovery, though the lea&s;t of the&s;e were enough to im|mortalize Emma Corbett; but I &s;hall convey your imagination to John's-Town, where Henry and his protector at la&s;t arrived, and found Sir Robert Raymond recovered from his fever, and ju&s;t a|bout to &s;et out again in pur&s;uit of Emma.</P>
<P>To her a&s;&s;iduous cares were now &s;uperadded tho&s;e of this excel|lent man, and Henry became in a &s;hort time the nur&s;eling of both&punc; He could walk, conver&s;e, and his wound was healing. Emma's dear perilous experiment was guarded &mdash; the pro&s;pect clear on every &s;ide. One afternoon Sir Robert gradually prepared Henry for the &s;ofte&s;t &s;urprize that could touch the heart of a lover; h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;cover|ed him&s;elf to be the friend of Mr. Corbett &mdash; he a&s;&s;ured Henry that he &s;aw Emma <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n good health a little before he left England &mdash; he a&s;&s;erted, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, her con&s;tancy, her attachment, her love &mdash; and &s;aid that &s;uch was the force of her affection he &s;hould not wonder &s;ome day or other to hear that &s;he was arrived in America.</P>
<P>&mdash;<HI>Yes,</HI> and in America &s;he <HI>is</HI> arrived, cried &s;he, (entering at this moment, agreeable to the plan concerted) She <HI>is</HI> arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he is <HI>here</HI> &mdash; &s;he is now in the pre&s;ence of her beloved Henry &mdash; &s;he now offers him the hand of Emma for EVER!</P>
<P>Emma was yet in her boy's apparel, but had wa&s;hed the &s;tain from her lovely countenance, and di&s;covered enough to throw Henry fir&s;t upon his knee to the re&s;toring God, and then into the arms of this tendere&s;t of women.</P>

<P><HI>THE</HI> ble&s;&s;ings of Providence are at length manife&s;t; &s;ince the pacquet from Henry mu&s;t, ere this, be come to band. It is not ea&s;y to tell you how totally I have in <HI>them</HI> annihilated <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> for many days pa&s;t. Henry recovers apace. The attentions of Emma, indeed, &s;o pointed and &s;o pure, might almo&s;t rai&s;e him from the dead. Yet I almo&s;t envy her the &s;hare &s;he has had in this di&s;covery, and all its happy con&s;equences. I can &s;carce forgive my illne&s;s for &s;ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g me at &s;uch a time. It is Emma alone who has been the &s;aviour of Henry. It is Henry only who can merit &s;uch &s;alvation. You can image to your|&s;elf nothing &s;o tender as his gratitude, &s;o warm as his affections, or &s;o perfect as his delicacy. From his &s;omewhat military &s;tile of addre&s;s I expected not this, and am equally &s;urprized and delighted. Yes, my dear old companion, you have yet a daughter, and will, in a few days, boa&s;t al&s;o &mdash;</P>
<P>Oh my friend, how infinitely I fall beneath the &s;tandard of my am|bition! How incorrect is human virtue! How frail is human for|titude! The pro&s;pect of Henry's becoming your <HI>SON</HI> does not charm this rebel heart half &s;o &s;incerely as it ought to do; and yet, Heaven is witne&s;s, that I am doing every thing to advance his health and his happine&s;s</P>
<P>Self intere&s;ted, perhaps, &s;till. I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt on promoting the felicity of Emma by any means. I am proud to plea&s;e her. I con&s;ider the youth of Henry, and wi&s;h it the joys it is formed to ta&s;te. I reflect on my own age, and think that I am too &s;illy to be pardoned. I am entirely convinced of my folly, and yet hug it to my heart. Ah Mr. Corbett, what is there in that &s;ubtle and active principle which we thus feed in our bo&s;oms, and which turns, &s;erpent-like, again&s;t the nouri&s;her?

I have found the vanity of attempting to argue my&s;elf into neutrality&punc; It is virtue and beauty that have attracted &mdash; that have bound me! Ere a &s;oul like mine can free it&s;elf from <HI>&s;uch</HI> captivity, the enchanting powers of its object mu&s;t change; its beauty become deformity, and its virtue vice. 'Tis out of the que&s;tion. The great point of moral pro|priety is in every man's power, and con&s;equently in mine. The human heart loves as it li&s;teth&mdash;it &s;ees its bias, and trembles towards it: but &s;ociety, religion, and the laws, are all to be re&s;pected, and he who pre&s;umes to overleap the&s;e, renders him&s;elf contemptible.</P>

<P>I HAVE brought my pul&s;es to be almo&s;t as obedient as I wi&s;h them. Rea&s;on is not &s;o weak a power as we make her appear. Her province is perhaps mi&s;under&s;tood, my friend It is not ty|ranny, but a mild and <HI>genial</HI> authority, which &s;he &s;hould exerci&s;e. The &s;ubjects of her &s;way are the pa&s;&s;ions; tho&s;e of the <HI>tender</HI> kind are with the mo&s;t difficulty governed.</P>
<P>I have applied to this our intellectual &s;overeign on a different principle. I implored her, not to in&s;pire me with that <HI>indifference</HI> which is the u&s;ual prayer of the di&s;appointed. The object of my love is married to the man of her heart. She obtained him at the price of almo&s;t unparalleled hazards. I &s;aw every hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion cut off. It was an intolerable agony. I bore it till I became al|mo&s;t de&s;perate. I indulged the pa&s;&s;ion even till the indi&s;&s;oluble bonds were tied again&s;t me. I &s;aw the madne&s;s of my pur&s;uit, and retired &mdash; retired, my dear Corbett, not to meditate revenge again&s;t a happy rival, but to manage my own wretchedne&s;s, and to <HI>think.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;erious appeal from the pa&s;&s;ions to the judgment is &s;eldom made in vain. We mi&s;carry, chiefly becau&s;e we are <HI>not</HI> &s;erious, but only <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> our&s;elves &s;o.</P>
<P>I &s;elected a quiet hour, and laid the &s;imple facts before me. They were not elaborate. The woman of my affection (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hus I argued) is now happily married. She is generous enough to pity and re&s;|pect me for mi&s;ery that &s;he hath very unwillingly occa&s;ioned. Ac|cidents have confirmed what Corbett at fir&s;t betrayed. I have too much contributed to her pre&s;ent happine&s;s for her to treat me un|tenderly: and yet my farther intimacy will increa&s;e her di&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="34" REF="017678_0130_0FA21EA111216040">
even if it does not &s;pread it&s;elf in time to her hu&s;band. How bit|terly does &s;he pay for my former &s;ervices! What hinders her, now that &s;he is in the arms of Henry, from looking upon my pa&s;|&s;ion as in&s;ulting and impious? Tho&s;e very &s;ervices. Do I then pre&s;ume, and per&s;ecute her upon the&s;e? Oh indelicacy! oh folly.</P>
<P>But can I conquer my affection? No. It is not po&s;&s;ible; it is not nece&s;&s;ary. To <HI>extingui&s;h bad</HI> pa&s;&s;ions, and to <HI>regulate good</HI> ones, are the two great points within the compa&s;s of rea&s;on. To covet any longer the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of Emma would be infamous. It is interdicted by law, by religion, and by God. But, are the merely &s;en&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions then at my age &s;o very gro&s;s, that by no exertion, no intere&s;t, I can &s;ubdue them? What will be the con&s;equence of my per&s;i&s;ting? The di&s;tre&s;s of Emma, who now &s;hould ta&s;te on|ly of joy, the &s;u&s;picion of Henry, who&s;e heart melts in gratitude towards me, and my own con&s;cious upbraiding. Can I <HI>&s;u&s;tain</HI> the&s;e, or is an ob&s;tinate attachment to the only point which rea&s;on refu&s;es me, (and which, after all, is hopele&s;s) &s;trong enough to &s;up|port me? But <HI>what</HI> then am I to do? Does rea&s;on bring with her no compen&s;ations &mdash; no equipoi&s;e of rewards for puni&s;hments &s;o &s;evere? She does, and MANY. Shall I not rank among&s;t tho&s;e the delights of a friend&s;hip not le&s;s <HI>tender</HI> though le&s;s <HI>intere&s;ted</HI>&mdash; the <HI>&s;ecret</HI>-breathed prayer for one human being who&s;e happine&s;s is dearer to <HI>me</HI> than that of any other upon the earth &mdash; the generous &s;igh &mdash; the &s;oftening tear &mdash; the &s;ocial &s;mile &mdash; the &s;elf gratulation &mdash; the flu&s;h of virtue, plea&s;ed with <HI>her&s;elf</HI> &mdash; the &s;mile of Emma &mdash; the a&s;&s;ent of HEAVEN?</P>
<P>Oh Mr. Corbett, we have glorious faculties, had we the re&s;olu|tion to exert them. We are afraid to <HI>begin.</HI> The heart trembles at a view of its labour. We venture to climb the &s;teep, and are di&s;mayed. But every difficulty of &s;oul and body dimini&s;hes by earne&s;t per&s;everance. However cragged the mountain, or &s;lippery its path, every effort brings us nearer to the &s;ummit; the &s;econd &s;tep is ea&s;ier than the fir&s;t, the third is &s;moother than the &s;econd. It is the motive of climbing that gives us fortitude. When the mo|tive it <HI>&s;o great</HI> as to concern the happine&s;s of others, and our own duty is included, &s;urely we &s;hould &s;truggle to a&s;cend. I, Corbett, <HI>have</HI> &s;truggled &mdash; I cannot &s;ay how much or how long, but I can and do tell you, in the &s;incerity of my &s;oul, that though I am not, nor perhaps &s;hall EVER be again a <HI>happy</HI> man, I do not wi&s;h either the death of Henry, or the alienation of his Emma's affection. I can &s;upport the pre&s;ence of both, when &s;oftne&s;s and wedded love &s;its <HI>faire&s;t</HI> upon their features. And, tho' many a ri&s;ing tear warns me that it is time to retire, no &s;entiment of irregular de&s;ire invades my heart. Henry cultivates my friend&s;hip with kinde&s;t care; I do not impute to him, his <HI>happine&s;s</HI> as his <HI>fault</HI> I recede not from his embrace, though I &s;eldom make advances to conver&s;ation that relates to Emma, and yet Emma is his perpetual &s;ubject, and his darling theme. Her own conduct is &s;uch as corre&s;ponds with

every part of her former life. Perhaps there never was a more affecting &s;ituation than &s;he has to perform whenever I am pre&s;ent. It is indeed too much for a nature &s;o gentle, and &s;o ingenuous. But I will remove the effect, by removing the cau&s;e. Humanity &s;hould not <HI>pre&s;ume</HI> to be perfect. I have carried a conque&s;t as far, perhaps, as it can go. I have acquired &s;trength by an examination of weakne&s;s. Let me not &s;ink into captivity by fool-hardine&s;s. I have done much. In attempting more, I may lo&s;e all the laurels I have won. Involuntary thoughts will tre&s;pa&s;s on the firme&s;t mind. Emma is a tender wife, a tender friend. Heaven continue her &s;o, while earth hath a feeling to make life de&s;irable. But the familiar intercour&s;e of a private family is &s;omewhat too much for me at pre&s;ent. I con&s;train Emma, whenever I vi&s;it her, and nature impells my &s;teps towards Philadelphia but too often &mdash; to appear re&s;trained. I beg you will tell my &s;teward to prepare Ca&s;tleberry for my reception. I will return to England. There is no danger of a relap&s;e; but I am obliged to repeat the re&s;cuing arguments too often.

<P>Two hours ago we arrived at the hou&s;e of the unfortunate Cor|bett. It was with the utmo&s;t difficulty his daughter reached town.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object that &s;truck her was a HEARSE &s;tanding clo&s;e be|&s;ide her father's door. In the pa&s;&s;age &s;he beheld the undertakers bearing a coffin down &s;tairs, The woe-worn Corbett was &s;upport|ed between two &s;ervants, to take his la&s;t mournful leave of the friend who&s;e remains were about to be depo&s;ited.

<P>&mdash; We are not provided with a language to expre&s;s the&s;e hor|rors.&mdash;</P>
<P>Almo&s;t an hour the child and parent remained &s;peechle&s;s &mdash; it was &s;urpri&s;e and agony, at once dumb and dreadful.</P>

<P>She dropped upon the pillow, from which &s;he twice vainly en|deavoured to rai&s;e her head, and lift her eye to the objects about her &mdash; THEN BREATHED HER LAST.</P>

<P>I AM ju&s;t come from the mo&s;t agonizing ceremony, oh Frederick, that can po&s;&s;ibly pa&s;s under the eye of man! &mdash; May you never feel what otherwi&s;e you can never know! Ea&s;y in your fortunes, quiet in your &s;ituation, unconnected in your intere&s;ts, you can, happily for you, have no conception &mdash; at lea&s;t no perfect one &mdash; of that rend in the heart which is made by death, when youth, in|nocence, and beauty, are committed to the du&s;t&mdash;when the parent hangs his drooping head over the la&s;t &s;ad man&s;ion &mdash; when the or|phans&mdash;</P>

The <HI>one</HI> &s;hall en&s;ure everla&s;t|ing exi&s;tence to the <HI>others.</HI> Innocence &s;hall immortalize beauty and youth.</P>
<P>I am rea&s;oning with an almo&s;t breaking heart, Berkley: while poor old Corbett, the &s;urvivor of his family, in all the &s;olemn pathos of grief, forgets every pain of body, nur&s;ing that which is &s;eated within.</P>
<P>The romance of youth may teach you to expect that I &s;hould &s;ummon to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance every infernal power &mdash; that I &s;hould tax heaven it&s;elf with cruelty, and take refuge from altercating man, amid&s;t the friendly concealment of impenetrable woods. This may, perhaps, an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the novelli&s;t, but it corre&s;|ponds not with the nature of your friend. No, Berkley. It is not in a moment like this that the truly touched and truly tender in|dulge them&s;elves in outrage. The fir&s;t bur&s;t is pa&s;t: that which began with loudne&s;s, with vehemence, and with vociferation, &s;ettles into the &s;till, the &s;olemn, and the affecting. The temper, &s;tormy and head&s;trong, of Corbett him&s;elf, terminates in the elo|quence of dumb di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The tears fall fa&s;t from me as I write. More <HI>impetuous</HI> periods I have felt: &s;o <HI>awful</HI> and &s;o <HI>affecting</HI> a cri&s;is, never. You, who knew not Emma, and have not a regular though you have a worthy heart, cannot know what I have lo&s;t. The manner of her death &mdash; the motive &mdash; and the whole tenour of circum&s;tances connected with it, throw over every pa&s;&s;age of the &s;cene, a colour &s;o moving|ly &s;ad, that I &s;it wonder-&s;truck in the room, and &s;eem almo&s;t in my grave, with the world about me.</P>
<P>I have exerted my&s;elf to &s;ay thus much at the winding up of this &s;olemn cata&s;trophe, le&s;t you, my dear Berkley, or any other per|&s;on, into who&s;e hands the&s;e incidents may fall, &s;hould pre&s;ume to que&s;tion the ways of ALMIGHTY GOD, which a re-ju&s;tifiable in every part of this pathetic &s;tory. Erroneous notions of puni&s;hment and reward are perhaps the leading &s;teps to irreligion and infidelity.</P>
<P>The vile herd of novelli&s;ts have done an e&s;&s;ential injury to the cau&s;e of virtue, by &s;acrificing to the plea&s;ure of the reader beyond

the &s;implicity of truth. Difficulty, in the beginning of a narrative; love, in the middle; and marriage, at the end, make up, almo&s;t invariably, the recipe of a modern romance. This is called re|warding virtue; a bad character or two, perhaps, drops off, and that is called puni&s;hing vice. Fal&s;e, fooli&s;h, conclu&s;ion!</P>
<P>Look into life. Doth not heaven's ble&s;&s;ed beam &s;hine equally on the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t? Are all rewards &s;o mechanically con|trived? Hath virtue no joys of her <HI>own?</HI>&mdash; joys, which generous &s;orrow only can produce? Is the &s;acred &s;truggle of a good man <HI>altogether afflictive?</HI> To pa&s;s through a road perplexed and thorny &mdash; to travel through an hard and difficult life, without tearing the finer principles from the heart, doth it require no better conduct than moves in the machinery of tho&s;e contemptible pages where all is given up to lettered art, and di&s;torted imagination? Are there no &s;weets in the pen&s;ive &s;igh &mdash; the pious tear? Break they from the mourner without offering him <HI>any</HI> balm? Hath heaven born con&s;tancy no comforts? Con&s;ider the life of Emma! Hath death, at once virtuous and chri&s;tian, nothing to lift the &s;urvivor's &s;pirit above every care of vulgar being?</P>
<P>Oh Frederick, I am touched by a very tender example. In la|menting as I <HI>now</HI> lament, &s;ay, my friend, are there <HI>no</HI> dear and welcome mitigations?

The Omnipotent placed her in the path of my life, to fix and concentrate the be&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions. I am not of di&s;po&s;ition or age to change again.</P>
<P>Oh that the daughter of Emma may live! Shall I be content with a parent's <HI>common</HI> duty &mdash;to cloathe, to feed, to educate? Con|&s;ider, Berkley, <HI>who&s;e</HI> babe it is!</P>
<P>I have hurried down &s;tairs to examine my trea&s;ure&punc;</P>
<P>&mdash; it lives, it &s;leeps&punc; I have felt its gentle breath on my cheek.</P>

<P>WE are removed to Ca&s;tleberry.

<HEAD><HI>A SPEECH</HI> on the probability of a <HI>HAPPY MARRIAGE</HI> addre&s;&s;ed By a <HI>FATHER</HI> to his <HI>DAUGHTER.</HI> From the French of <HI>JOHN JAMES ROUSSEAU.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU are now, Sophy, grown up to woman's e&s;tate; and you are not to remain always &s;ingle. Your mother and I would have you happy, becau&s;e our happine&s;s depends on yours. The happine&s;s of a virtuous young woman, is to make an hone&s;t man happy: we mu&s;t therefore think of marrying you. We mu&s;t think of this betimes, for your fate through life depends on your mar|riage; and we cannot think too much upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="017678_0142_0FA21EAB40FFC878">Nothing perhaps is more difficult than the choice of a good hu&s;band, except perhaps the choo&s;ing of a good wife. You, Sophy, will be this rare woman; you will be the pride of our lives, and our happine&s;s in old age. But however great merit you may have, there are men who have &s;till more. There is no man who ought not to think it an honour to obtain you: there are many whom it would do you honour to obtain. Among this number the bu&s;ine&s;s is to find one &s;uitable to you, to get acquainted with him, and to make him acquainted with you.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t happine&s;s of marriage, depends on &s;o many points of agreement, that it would be a folly to think to find them all; the mo&s;t important mu&s;t be made &s;ure of, preferably to the re&s;t; if the others can be procured too, &s;o much the better; if they cannot, they mu&s;t be overlooked. Perfect happine&s;s is not to be found in this world; but the greate&s;t of misfortunes, and that which may always be avoided, is to be unhappy by one's own fault.</P>
<P>There is a &s;uitablene&s;s which may be called natural; there is al&s;o a &s;uitablene&s;s ari&s;ing from the in&s;titutions of men, and a &s;ui|tablene&s;s that depends wholly on opinion; of the two la&s;t, parents are the proper judges; of the fir&s;t, the children alone can judge. In marriages made by the authority of parents, tho&s;e &s;uitablene&s;&s;es that ari&s;e from civil in&s;titutions and opinion are alone minded; the matches are not between the per&s;ons, but between their rank and fortunes; but both the&s;e are &s;ubject to change: the per&s;ons alone remain the &s;ame, in all places, and at all times; the happine&s;s or unhappine&s;s of the marriage &s;tate depends, in &s;pite of fortune, on per&s;onal and mental &s;uitablene&s;s.</P>
<P>Your mother was a woman of family, I had a large fortune; the&s;e were the &s;ole con&s;iderations that influenced our parents to join us together. I have lo&s;t my fortune, &s;he has lo&s;t her rank; for|got by her family. what doth it &s;ignify to her that &s;he was born a lady? In the mid&s;t of our di&s;tre&s;s, the union of our hearts made up for every thing&punc; the conformity of our ta&s;tes made us choo&s;e this retirement. We live happy in our poverty; each is to the other in|&s;tead of all. Sophy is our common trea&s;ure; we thank the Almighty for giving her, and taking away every thing el&s;e. You &s;ee, child, whither Providence hath brought us. Tho&s;e con&s;iderations which occa&s;ioned our marriage are vani&s;hed, and that which was accounted as nothing makes all our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It is for man and wife to &s;uit them&s;elves. Mutual inclination ought to be their fir&s;t tie; their eyes, their hearts ought to be their fir&s;t guides; for as their primary duty, after they are joined to|gether, is to love one another, and as to love, or not to love, doth not depend on us, this duty nece&s;&s;arily implies another, namely, to begin with loving one another before marriage. This is a law of nature which cannot be abrogated; the&s;e w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o have re&s;tricted it, by many civil laws, have had more regard to the appearance of order than to the happine&s;s or the morals of the people. You &s;ee my
<PB N="47" REF="017678_0143_0FA21EABA1DF3BF0">
dear that the morality we preach to you is not difficult; it tends only to make you your own mi&s;tre&s;s, and to make us refer our|&s;elves entirely to you for the choice of your hu&s;band.</P>
<P>After giving you our rea&s;ons for leaving you at full liberty to make your own choice, it is proper to mention tho&s;e which ought induce you to u&s;e it with prudence. Sophy, you have got good nature, and good &s;en&s;e, much integrity and piety, and tho&s;e qualifications which a woman ought to have; and you are not di&s;|agreeable, but you have no fortune; you have the be&s;t riches in|deed, but you want tho&s;e which are mo&s;t valued by the world. Do not a&s;pire, therefore, to what you cannot attain to; and regu|late your ambition not by your own judgment, or your mother<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and mine, but by the opinion of men. If nothing were to be con&s;idered but merit equal to your own, I know not where I &s;hould &s;et limits to your hopes; but never rai&s;e them above your fortune, which you are to remember is very &s;mall. You never &s;aw our pro&s;perity; you were born after we failed in the world. You have made our poverty plea&s;ing to us, and we have &s;hared in it without pain. Never, child, &s;eek for that wealth which we thank Heaven for taking from us; we never ca&s;ted happine&s;s until we lo&s;t our riches.</P>
<P>You are too agreeable, Sophy, not to plea&s;e &s;omebody; and you are not &s;o poor as to render you a burthen to an hone&s;t man. You will be courted, and perhaps by per&s;ons who are not worthy of you. If they &s;how them&s;elves what they really are, you will form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of them, their out&s;ide will not impo&s;e upon you long; but, though you have good judgment, and can di&s;cern me|rit, you want experience, and know not how far men can di&s;em|ble. An artful cheat may &s;tudy your ta&s;te, in order to &s;educe you, and counterfeit before you the virtues to which he is an ab&s;olute &s;tranger. Such a one, child, would ruin you before you perceived it; and you would not &s;ee your error, untill it was pa&s;t recovery. The mo&s;t dangerous of all &s;nares, and the only one from which rea&s;on can re&s;train you, is that into which the pa&s;&s;ions hurry one&punc; if ever you have the misfortune to fall into it, you will &s;ee no|thing but illu&s;ions and chimeras, your eyes will be fa&s;cinated, your judgment will be confu&s;ed, your will, will be corrupted, you will cheri&s;h your very error; and when you come to &s;ee it, you will have no de&s;ire to leave it. It is to Sophy's rea&s;on, not to the bias of her heart, that we commit her; while pa&s;&s;ion hath no a&s;cendency over you, judge for your&s;elf; but whenever you fall in love, commit the care of your&s;elf to your mother.</P>
<P>This agreement which I propo&s;e to you, &s;hews our e&s;teem for you, and re&s;tores the natural order. It is u&s;ual for parents to choo&s;e a hu&s;band for their daughters, and to con&s;ult her only for form's &s;ake: We &s;hall do ju&s;t the contrary; you &s;hall choo&s;e, and we &s;hall be con&s;ulted. Make u&s;e of this right, Sophy, freely and wi&s;ely; the hu&s;band that is &s;uitable for you ought to be your own choice, and not our's; but it is who mu&s;t judge whether you
<PB N="48" REF="017678_0144_0FA21EAE1ACE6188">
are not mi&s;taken in his &s;uitablene&s;s for you, and whether you are not doing, without knowing it, what you have no mind to. Birth, fortune rank, or the opinion of the world, will have no weight with us. Take an hone&s;t man, who&s;e per&s;on you like, and who&s;e temper is &s;uitable to you; whatever he be in other re&s;pects, we &s;hall recieve him for our &s;on-in-law: his income will be always large enough, if he hath hands, and good morals, and loves his family. His rank will always be high, if be ennobles it by virtue&punc; If every body &s;hould blame us, what doth it &s;ignify? We &s;eek not the approbation of the public; your happine&s;s &s;uffices to us.</P>
