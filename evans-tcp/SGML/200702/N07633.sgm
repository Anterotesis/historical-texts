<HEAD>REMARKS ON AN Anonymous TRACT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the Tract before me, has thought proper to conceal his name and quality, in com|mon with others who have written again&s;t the <HI>Ob&s;ervations:</HI> So that whatever may be his real dignity, I cannot with propriety &s;peak of him under any higher title than that of <HI>gentleman.</HI> He is doubtle&s;s a per&s;on of excellent &s;en&s;e, and an happy talent at wri|ting; apparently free from the &s;ordid, illiberal &s;pirit of bigotry; one of a cool temper, and who often &s;hews much candor; well acquainted with the affairs of the So|ciety, and, in general, a fair rea&s;oner. To &s;ay this, is but doing ju&s;tice to the merits of an opponent; a &s;pecies of ju&s;tice too &s;eldom found in controver&s;ial writers. And all this I acknowledge with much more plea&s;ure than ever I had in expo&s;ing the contrary qualities in an adver&s;ary: It being far more agreeable to me to prai&s;e, where prai&s;e is due, than to blame, even where blame is highly de&s;erved.</P>
<P>It is not my intention, in the following pages, to ex|amine every thing which this re&s;pectable writer has offered in oppo&s;ition to my <HI>Ob&s;ervations.</HI> Some, which I thought did not very materially affect the merits of the cau&s;e, are pa&s;&s;ed over for the &s;ake of brevity. Others are left un|noticed, becau&s;e the &s;ame things in effect were &s;ufficiently
<PB N="4" REF="009738_0003_0F7A4C00F7CF0490">
con&s;idered in my <HI>Defence</HI> of the <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> publi&s;hed in Bo&s;ton &s;ome time ago. I have neither &s;o much lei&s;ure or health, nor &s;uch an itch for altercation, as to protract a di&s;pute upon circum&s;tantial matters. Nor do I conceive that an argument increa&s;es in &s;trength, by being frequently repeated, as a &s;now-ball does in magnitude, by being of|ten rolled over and over. If what was offered in my <HI>Defence</HI> again&s;t a certain <HI>Examiner</HI> and <HI>Letter-writer,</HI> was valid, it will be equally &s;o again&s;t this gentleman, &s;o far as their objections are alike: If not, it would be no ad|vantage to me to &s;ay the &s;ame things over again. For the&s;e rea&s;ons I reque&s;t, that it may not be &s;uppo&s;ed, or ta|ken for granted, that I concede to every thing in the Tract before me, which I do not take a particular notice of; or that I pa&s;s any over, that are material, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my inability to an&s;wer them. Not the&s;e, but tho&s;e which I have already a&s;&s;igned, are the true rea|&s;ons of my conduct in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, though with reluctance, that there are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in this <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> which I do not well know how to reconcile with that candor and ingenuity, which have already been allowed to the author. The fir&s;t pa|ragraph is one of them. He is there plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that my book was written, partly again&s;t <HI>the church of Eng|land in general;</HI> partly again&s;t <HI>the conduct of the Society,</HI> and partly again&s;t <HI>appointing bi&s;hops for America.</HI> He indeed grants, immediately after, that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e three, was <HI>not formally propo&s;ed by me as one head of my work.</HI> By which di&s;tinction he plainly leads his reader to &s;uppo&s;e, that both the other points were <HI>formally propo&s;ed</HI> by me, as coming within my de&s;ign: Whereas the affair of <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> was not, but altogether as incidental as what relates to <HI>the church of England in general;</HI> re&s;pecting which latter, I &s;aid expre&s;sly, 'It was by <HI>no means</HI> my de&s;ign in this publication, to enter into the controver&s;y

But had &s;ome other per&s;ons &s;et out in the &s;ame manner, multiplying <HI>one</HI> de&s;ign into <HI>three,</HI> repre&s;enting it as having been <HI>in my view throughout the whole of my book,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, to oppo&s;e the church of England, and undertaking to give previous &s;a|tisfaction to candid per&s;ons on this point, that they might be the <HI>better prepared</HI> to con&s;ider the <HI>other two:</HI> Had &s;ome other per&s;ons taken this method, it might naturally have been con&s;idered as a mere piece of craft, or an un|worthy artifice, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s their unwary epi&s;copal readers in favour of their de&s;ign to prejudice them again&s;t me and mine, and thereby to render them very <HI>partial</HI> judges of the true and only point which I undertook to debate. Did his readers, who are probably almo&s;t all of them epi&s;|copalians, need to be thus <HI>prepared</HI> for con&s;idering the ar|gument re&s;pecting the Society? But I am very unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e, this gentleman had a de&s;ign that would be &s;o little to his honor, and would make my encomiums have the appearance of <HI>flattery.</HI> The reader is therefore de&s;ired to put the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction he can, on this conduct; and by that means, if po&s;&s;ible, to ju&s;tify my commendations: For I would not have any one con|&s;true them into <HI>adulation,</HI> equally to the di&s;honor of my worthy <HI>An&s;werer</HI> and my &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009738_0005_0F7A4C027A501DA8">
In pur&s;uance of this de&s;ign, duly to <HI>prepare</HI> his readers for con&s;idering the main point, he proceeds to a vindica|tion of the church of England, and of the hierarchy, in oppo&s;ition to certain expre&s;&s;ions which I occa&s;ionally made u&s;e of. Some of the&s;e might perhaps be too har&s;h and irritating. Had epi&s;copalians in general &s;hewn the &s;ame love to religious liberty, and the &s;ame moderation towards non-conformi&s;ts, that this gentleman has, I am confident he would not have thought, that he had any ground of complaint in this re&s;pect. I have the honor to agree with him in what he &s;ays in different places, concerning the intolerant &s;pirit that formerly prevailed, even among pro|te&s;tants of almo&s;t every denomination, and the better &s;pi|rit of mutual forbearance, that has for &s;ome time been growing among them. Would to God that they may continue to cultivate the latter, without abating in a zeal that is <HI>according to knowledge,</HI> for the great, in|di&s;putable doctrines and duties of chri&s;tianity, or degene|rating into a &s;tate of indifference and &s;ceptici&s;m about all religion; the oppo&s;ite extreme and not a more innocent one, tho' le&s;s pernicious to the peace of &s;ociety, and com|mon rights of mankind, than bigotry and per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>But my real &s;entiments concerning the con&s;titution, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline of the church of England, are no ways altered by any thing which this gentleman has &s;aid. If the Lutherans prefer her communion to the Calvini&s;tic, the Calvini&s;ts to the Lutheran, and the Greeks to both, (which, by the way, is a&s;&s;erted without proof;) or if mo&s;t, or even all of them <HI>blame the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>di&s;&s;enters for &s;eparating from it</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 4.</NOTE>; yet this carries no proper ground of conviction with it, that her communion is the <HI>be&s;t.</HI> A true prote&s;tant judges, not by the majority of votes or numbers, but by &s;cripture and rea&s;on. The Gentleman &s;ays, I &s;eem to entertain the wor&s;e opinion of the church of England, <Q>becau&s;e the members of the church of Rome likewi&s;e <HI>e&s;teem</HI> it more than they do others.</Q> Truly I
<PB N="7" REF="009738_0006_0F7A4C04F873B8A0">
can hardly think any church a very pure or &s;criptural one, which has the <HI>e&s;teem</HI> of &s;o corrupt and antichri&s;tian a church as that of Rome, the <HI>mother of harlots, and abo|minations of the earth.</HI> He immediately &s;ubjoins; <Q>But we have to reply, that they <HI>hate</HI> it more al&s;o, as the mo&s;t dangerous enemy to their cau&s;e, and &s;tronge&s;t bulwark of the reformation.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 4.</NOTE> So that this gentleman &s;eems to draw an argument for the excellency of his church, not only from the <HI>e&s;teem,</HI> but from the <HI>hatred</HI> of that of Rome: Neither of which con&s;iderations has any tendency to make me think the better of her. Becau&s;e this e&s;teem of the church of Rome on one hand, and her hatred on the other, are mo&s;t naturally re&s;olved into &s;uch cau&s;es, as are rather di&s;honourable to the church of England, than the contrary; her e&s;teem, into the remaining &s;imilitude between them, and her hatred, into a rival&s;hip for power, worldly &s;plendor and preheminence. What the gentle|man thinks the church of Rome e&s;teems that of England for, whether her excellencies or blemi&s;hes, he has not told us; I am &s;atisfied, it is on account of the latter; and have others to conjecture as they plea&s;e. But he him&s;elf has ob&s;erved, that the Roman-catholicks hate the church, of England, con&s;idered <HI>as the mo&s;t dangerous enemy to their cau&s;e.</HI> It is as natural for them to do &s;o, as for one gaily-attired lady to look with an evil eye upon another; e&s;pecially con&s;idering that the church of England has a mighty King for her head, and lays claim to &s;ome of the highe&s;t powers and prerogatives a&s;&s;erted by the other; <Q>power to decree rites and ceremonies, and authority in controver&s;ies of faith</Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Article 20.</NOTE> Here is a foundation laid, broad enough to &s;upport almo&s;t any &s;uper&s;tructure, tho' as enormous an one, as that which is rai&s;ed on the &s;up|po&s;ed infallibility and power of <HI>St. Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</HI> Who then can wonder, if the church of Rome hates that of England, as a dangerous enemy and rival?</P>
<P>And hath not the church of England acted as if &s;he were really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this extraordinary power and
<PB N="8" REF="009738_0007_0F7A4C05D2363370">
authority, re&s;pecting rites, ceremonies and controver&s;ies of faith? The gentleman indeed allows, that the &s;aid church hath <HI>&s;ome appointments in it, which the &s;cripture doth not require.</HI> This is candidly, tho' very cautiou&s;ly &s;aid. But when he &s;ubjoins, a little after, <Q>Ours hath not <HI>many things</HI> of this kind, nor lays <HI>great &s;tre&s;s</HI> upon them</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 4.</NOTE>; I am a little &s;urpri&s;ed: Tho', to return one of his compliments to me, <Q>One mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>he believes him&s;elf, and as far as po&s;&s;ible,</HI> I would believe him al&s;o</Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 8.</NOTE>. But it is no ea&s;y matter for a per&s;on who duly con&s;iders the offices of bapti&s;m, confirmation, the Lord's &s;upper, ordination, matrimony and burial; the numerous fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals, &s;aints days and &s;inners, the creeds, the liturgy and the canons of &s;aid church in gene|ral, to think that <HI>appointments</HI> of the kind he &s;peaks of, are not <HI>many,</HI> or that no <HI>great &s;tre&s;s</HI> is laid upon them. Can any one live in regular communion with that church, without &s;ubmitting to many &s;uch? Can people come into the World, tarry in, or go out of it? can they be born, live or die, without them? And for how many things which, to <HI>non-conforming</HI> under&s;tandings at lea&s;t, appear extremely trivial, do the canons &s;till in force declare, that people &s;hall be <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> excommunicated, and not re|&s;tored till they retract their &s;aid <HI>wicked errors?</HI></P>
<P>The gentleman &s;eems to think that appointments of this nature, if they are not &s;uch as the &s;cripture expre&s;ly forbids, tho' it doth not require them, ought to be com|plied with. In which I cannot agree with him; becau&s;e, tho' they may not be expre&s;ly forbidden, yet they are implicitly, and by natural con&s;truction. The law of God may be in a great mea&s;ure <HI>made void</HI> by the traditions, and numerous inventions of men in his wor&s;hip, not one of which is perhaps directly repugnant to any particular precept. And it is &s;aid, partly with reference to appoint|ments of that kind, which &s;ome think &s;o innocent, comely and expedient, <HI>In vain do they wor&s;hip me, teach|ing for doctrines the commandments of men.</HI> Some of our

Engli&s;h epi&s;copalians have &s;hewn a laudable zeal in this re&s;pect, again&s;t the church of Rome; for departing from the &s;criptures as the only rule of chri&s;tian faith, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline; not perhaps con&s;idering how ju&s;tly this charge might be retorted upon them, in a degree, by prote|&s;tant di&s;&s;enters. For example; <Q>The thing I would recommend to the con&s;ideration of all <HI>papi&s;ts,</HI></Q> &s;ays a lear|ned and able writer, <Q>is <HI>their departure from &s;cripture.</HI> Why do they command ab&s;tinence from <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> on &s;o many days in every week?

I do not charge them with allowing of exce&s;&s;es in liquors, but with enjoining &s;o many fa&s;t and meagre days, on a <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> not a <HI>medicinal</HI> account; and this, <HI>without authority from Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles</HI></Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See an excellent, and very important Tract, entitled <HI>An En|quiry how far the Papi&s;ts ought to be treated here</HI> [in England] <HI>at good &s;ubjects</HI> &amp;c.

<P>I humbly conceive, the gentleman goes a little too far, when he intimates that there are &s;imilar appointments <HI>in all the churches in the world:</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 4</NOTE> I know of &s;ome churches at lea&s;t, in which there are none &s;uch.

Very great corruptions were introduced much earlier than many are willing to allow; and were confir|med even by general councils. For, to u&s;e the words of

the &s;ame learned epi&s;copalian divine, (to whom I ju&s;t now referred) in another important tract, <Q>What have gene|ral councils been (I &s;peak of all <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> from the council of <HI>Nice</HI> to the council of <HI>Trent</HI>) but the meet|ings of <HI>corrupt, ambitious, intriguing, contentious</HI> men; who never once attempted to &s;erve the cau&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but <HI>them&s;elves:</HI> Who have ever, by fraud and craft, and cunning, aimed at <HI>&s;uperiority</HI> and <HI>power</HI> over tho&s;e whom they had a mind to oppre&s;s, and who never at|tempted to e&s;tabli&s;h truth as it lies in Chri&s;t: Who have endeavoured to gain a majority by art and power, <HI>without regard to the bible,</HI> or <HI>what is there enjoined:</HI> Who have always contended for &s;ome <HI>addition</HI> or other to the go&s;pel, but never to leave the word of God to <HI>its own native &s;implicity:</HI> Who, la&s;tly, have wre&s;ted and perverted the <HI>&s;cripture,</HI> but never have taught it <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>uncorrupted</HI>?</Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>The Rea&s;onablene&s;s of mending and executing the laws a|gain&s;t Papi&s;ts,</HI> p. 21.</NOTE></P>

And the gen|tleman would doubtle&s;s have &s;pared this critical remark, had he recollected that I made u&s;e of Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s ex|pre&s;&s;ion, who &s;pake of the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury only as <HI>pre&s;iding:</HI>&mdash;<Q>the excellent <HI>prelate,</HI> who now &s;o wor|thily <HI>pre&s;ides</HI> over the church of England, and the So|ciety it&s;elf</Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;id.

The gentleman adds, that I knew the Archbi&s;hops pre&s;ide <HI>in &s;ubordination to the king;</HI>' though he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that I <HI>di&s;ingenuou&s;ly hint a doubt of it.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An&s;. p. 5.</NOTE> I indeed well knew, that the King is the legal Head of the church of England, that all her bi&s;hops and clergy take the oath of &s;upremacy, and that they &s;olemnly di&s;claim all &s;piritual power and juri&s;diction, but as under, and derived from him. Of the&s;e things I intimated no <HI>doubt;</HI> but only whether the &s;aid bi&s;hops and clergy were always con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, in reference thereto; or whether they have not often claimed &s;uch an independency on the crown and &s;tate, as to &s;hew them very in&s;incere in their oaths and &s;ub&s;criptions. And let tho&s;e who are acquainted with the writings of many high-flyers, and their jure-divino|preten&s;ions, judge whether there was any <HI>di&s;ingenuity</HI> or not, in hinting a doubt in this re&s;pect. Be&s;ides, the gen|tleman is mi&s;taken if he &s;uppo&s;es, I meant to draw an <HI>ex|act</HI> parallel between the churches of England and Rome. And if any per&s;on of a tolerable capacity, could be &s;up|po&s;ed &s;o ignorant and pre&s;umptuous as to undertake this, he would not, &s;urely, compare an Engli&s;h archbi&s;hop to his Holine&s;s: An Archbi&s;hop in the church of England, is not equal even to a Cardinal in that of Rome.

cro&s;&s;ed their ambitious and avaritious de&s;igns, they have been as forward as any men, if not more &s;o, to give them di&s;quietude. In the words of a &s;pirited writer, well ver&s;ed in matters of this &s;ort, 'Loyalty is not confined to the mitre. Bi&s;hops have given more di&s;turbance, and oc|ca&s;ioned more di&s;tre&s;&s;es to princes and people, than any other &s;et of men upon earth. This I can prove. Our own bi&s;hops, for near an hundred years before the revo|lution, were in every &s;cheme for promoting tyranny and bondage.' I can a&s;&s;ure the gentleman, however, that my <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> is much too great to <HI>propo&s;e &s;uch an alteration</HI> in the con&s;titution, as he &s;peaks, of; tho' I know it has often been wi&s;hed by much <HI>wi&s;er</HI> men; and, that &s;uch argu|ments have been u&s;ed, as might perhaps puzzle one <HI>near as wi&s;e</HI> as him&s;elf to an&s;wer The old cry, <HI>No bi&s;hop, no king</HI> has indeed been of mighty efficacy in times pa&s;t. 'This &s;olid argument, &s;ays one, was u&s;ed with royal &s;uc|ce&s;s, by King <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t, when he &s;at <HI>deputy</HI> for the clergy, and di&s;puted with the puritans, at the conference of <HI>Hampton Court.</HI> It was indeed the be&s;t he could u&s;e; however he &s;trengthened and embelli&s;hed it with &s;everal imperial oaths, which he &s;wore on that occa&s;ion, to the utter confu&s;ion of his antagoni&s;ts, and the great triumph of the <HI>genuine clergy,</HI> and the <HI>Archbi&s;hop;</HI> who be&s;towed the Holy Gho&s;t upon his Maje&s;ty, for his zeal and &s;wea|ring on the church's &s;ide.'

really much at heart, that we &s;hould be <HI>convinced</HI> and <HI>reclaimed,</HI> and all become epi&s;popalians; yet it would not be ea&s;y to &s;hew what methods they could have u&s;ed, more adapted to, and more clearly declarative of, &s;uch a de&s;ign, than tho&s;e which they have actually taken. Neither Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> nor my very <HI>candid</HI> (N. England) <HI>Examiner,</HI> &s;o far as I can at pre&s;ent recollect, pretended to di&s;own that the Society actually had this de&s;ign; but &s;eemed ra|ther to ju&s;tify it, as what the Society had a right to attempt, if not by the mo&s;t obvious &s;cope of their charter, yet by virtue of the di&s;cretionary power therein granted. And it is well known that many epi&s;copalian among us, have a&s;&s;erted this to have been one primary, original de&s;ign of the In&s;titution; being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, a&s;hamed either to deny a thing &s;o manife&s;t, as that the Society were actually endeavouring to accompli&s;h it, or that they had not good authority to do &s;o, by their charter.</P>
<P>Now, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that my <HI>unknown An&s;werer</HI>'s a&s;&s;ertions, that the Society have not been endeavouring to promote a general conformity among us to the church of England, &s;ufficient to counter-balance the evidence of &s;uch a de&s;ign, ari&s;ing from the words of their own <HI>Account,</HI> from the <HI>In&s;truction</HI> afore&s;aid, from Dr. <HI>Bear|croft</HI>'s &s;ermon, from the practices of the mi&s;&s;ionaries, and their letters to the Society, by which it appears that they look on the making pro&s;elytes, as a material part of their bu&s;ine&s;s, if not the greate&s;t of their merit? In &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, the a&s;&s;ertion of an unknown per&s;on will not be &s;ufficient with impartial men. Nothing &s;hort of the Society's direct, formal di&s;avowal of &s;uch an intention, is &s;ufficient to over-balance the joint evidence of it, re&s;ulting from all circum&s;tances. And indeed, this evidence is &s;o &s;trong, that I do not believe they will ever ri&s;que any part of their reputation, by declaring that they have not had this, at lea&s;t partly in their view in &s;ending &s;o large a proportion of their mi&s;&s;ionaries into New-England.</P>
<P>But the gentleman (after mentioning &s;omething which Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> have &s;aid upon this &s;ubject) adds, that <HI>a very re&s;pectable mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> u&s;es the following

And &s;ince publi&s;hing that account, I have received &s;uch farther informations as render it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible not to believe, that the Society knew &s;omething of that unhappy man's vile conduct, even when they confirmed him as a mi&s;&s;ionary at <HI>Hopkinton;</HI> tho' I can truly &s;ay, it gives me great pain to make a &s;uppo&s;ition, which appears &s;o highly di&s;honourable to that venerable body.</P>
<P>Let me now add, upon good authority, tho' not upon my own knowledge, that other New-England mi&s;&s;ionaries have received, not to &s;ay courted, to their communion,

He &s;peaks to the &s;ame purpo&s;e re&s;pecting the number of petitioners to the Society, in other places, in oppo&s;ition to what I intimated. And indeed I have rea&s;on to think, it has been the common way, to get as many names as po&s;&s;ible to the petitions &s;ent home; the names of per&s;ons living at 20 or 30 miles di&s;tance from the propo&s;ed &s;eat of the mi&s;&s;ions; and of &s;ome, who lived in towns where there were already epi&s;copal mini&s;ters; as in the dirty affair of commi&s;&s;ary <HI>Price</HI> at Hopkinton. So that the Society has been greatly impo&s;ed on, being made to believe that all at the petitioners lived within &s;uch a di&s;tance, that they could ordinarily and conveniently attend the &s;ervice of the church. As to Cambridge, the ca&s;e was briefly and plainly this: There were five or &s;ix gentlemen of figure, each of who&s;e income, it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, was &s;o large, as to have admitted of his maintaining a <HI>dome&s;tic chaplain;</HI> there not being as many more epi&s;copalian families in &s;aid town. Tho&s;e gentlemen u&s;ed &s;ometimes to come to Bo&s;ton to church, in their coaches or chariots; at others, to attend the public wor&s;hip in the congregational church in Cambridge, I pre&s;ume without <HI>hurting their con&s;ciences</HI> by doing &s;o. But preferring the church of England, for what rea&s;ons I will not gue&s;s, le&s;t I &s;hould not <HI>hit right,</HI> they were de&s;irous to have a church built, and a mi&s;&s;ionary fixed there.

<P>The gentleman thinks I had no ju&s;t cau&s;e for &s;aying, that the <HI>epi&s;copalians affect to reproach us under the name of</HI> independents.

<P>I &s;ee no rea&s;on, from any thing this gentleman has &s;aid in &s;everal pages,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 18&mdash;22.</NOTE> to change my opinion about the <HI>motives</HI> which <HI>generally</HI> induce people among us, to go over to the church of England: And I know who, and <HI>what &s;ort</HI> of per&s;ons they are, at lea&s;t as well as he can be &s;uppo&s;ed to do.

He adds: <Q>We <HI>may</HI> ap|prehend that after the cea&s;ing of <HI>extraordinary</HI> &s;piritual gifts, <HI>forms</HI> of prayer were al&s;o u&s;ed, more or le&s;s, thro'|out the church of Chri&s;t, and are needful for the ob&s;er|vance of the &s;cripture rule. <HI>Let all things be done decent|ly and in order.</HI></Q> This al&s;o they <HI>may apprehend.</HI> But if tho&s;e <HI>extraordinary gifts</HI> cea&s;ed as early as Dr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> and many others &s;uppo&s;e, I pre&s;ume the gentleman can bring no proof, that forms of prayer were introduced from that time, or even 'till long afterwards. As to the <HI>&s;cripture rule</HI> which the gentleman &s;peaks of, re&s;pecting <HI>decency</HI> and <HI>order;</HI> if forms of prayer may be &s;uppo&s;ed to come under it, &s;o as to be <HI>needful for the ob&s;ervance thereof;</HI> why may not the &s;ign of the cro&s;s al&s;o? Why may not &s;quare caps, or any u&s;ages in the wor&s;hip of God, which fanciful men think conducive to order and decency? Where will people &s;top in introducing their own inventions, in this lax way of expounding &s;cripture rules? Or what bounds will be &s;et to their cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, if they allow them&s;elves to cen&s;ure tho&s;e, who decline the u&s;e of any unin&s;tituted modes and forms, which they conceive to be decent and orderly? I am, in|deed, my&s;elf far from being zealous again&s;t all forms of prayer, as &s;uch: But to &s;uppo&s;e they are nece&s;&s;ary, that God cannot be orderly and decently wor&s;hipped without them, or that it is &s;inful to decline them, is highly unrea|&s;onable and &s;uper&s;titious.</P>
<P>I do not think my&s;elf concerned particularly to con&s;ider the &s;everal cau&s;es, to which the gentleman a&s;cribes the growth of the church of England among us. He mentions one, however, which I cannot but take a cur&s;ory notice of. He &s;ays, that when the epi&s;popalians among us were <HI>attack|ed</HI> and <HI>reproached</HI> for their religious principles, <HI>it was na|tural that they &s;hould endeavour to defend them&s;elves, and procure &s;uch books as would enable them to do it better.</HI> He immediately adds; <Q>Some of the <HI>more candid</HI> and <HI>inqui&s;i|tive</HI> among the pre&s;byterians and congregationali&s;ts <HI>adven|tured</HI> to hear their defences, and to read their authors;

were convinced by them, and became churchmen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 22.</NOTE>.</Q> So that, according to this gentleman, the pro&s;elytes to the church of England here, have been &s;ome of our <HI>mo&s;t can|did, inqui&s;itive</HI> and <HI>booki&s;h</HI> men; &s;uch as have taken the mo&s;t pains to under&s;tand, the merits of the controver&s;y! Doubtle&s;s he takes his information in this re&s;pect, from the good mi&s;&s;ionaries, who had a right to &s;peak as they tho't. I have the &s;ame right; and accordingly declare, from what I have ob&s;erved, that I &s;uppo&s;e very few inqui&s;itive per|&s;ons, or &s;tudiers of this controver&s;y among us, have become churchmen in con&s;equence thereof. Some &s;uch there may have been; but, I believe, the&s;e pro&s;elytes have much more generally been young and thoughtle&s;s per&s;ons; the volatile and un&s;table; &s;uch as had but a very moderate &s;hare of un|der&s;tanding, or but little &s;obriety; and who hardly ever read a book in their lives, really with a view to inform them|&s;elves about the true &s;tate of this controver&s;y&mdash;But it is not worth while to di&s;pute about &s;uch things as do not, in their nature, admit of a deci&s;ion on either &s;ide; e&s;pecially &s;uch as have little relation to the pre&s;ent argument.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>To come directly to the main point; the gentleman ac|knowledges <Q>that the ca&s;e of the <HI>New-England epi&s;co|palians,</HI> is not particularly de&s;cribed and provided for in the [Society's] charter</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pag 23.</NOTE>. I conclude he means, what is certainly true, that the charter does not expre&s;ly make provi&s;ion for &s;upplying with epi&s;copal mini&s;ters, per&s;ons in &s;uch circum&s;tances as they are; or people who live &s;cattered here and there, in towns of non conforming pro|te&s;tants, where due provi&s;ion is made for the admini&s;tration of God's word and ordinances, after the presbyterian or congregational mode. I cannot &s;uppo&s;e he intended only to acknowledge, that New-England and the epi&s;copalians here, are not mentioned by name in the charter; or that their ca&s;e is not very largely and particularly &s;poken of therein. This would be &s;aying nothing of con&s;equence: For neither is any other particular colony, or country, or the people therein, thus provided for in expre&s;s terms. But then the thing in&s;i&s;ted on, as I conceive with great rea&s;on, is, that tho' the charter does not di&s;tingui&s;h the
<PB N="28" REF="009738_0027_0F7A4C1AD174A0C0">
colonies by name, &s;aying that the epi&s;copalians in <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that,</HI> &s;hall be provided for, but not tho&s;e in <HI>others;</HI> yet it is &s;o expre&s;&s;ed, as to amount to the &s;ame thing. For it de&s;cribes the religious circum&s;tances of tho&s;e places and people, which were to be relieved, as de&s;titute of the <HI>ad|mini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments,</HI> &amp;c. Now, if the epi&s;copalians in &s;ome of the plantations are actually in &s;uch a &s;tate; but tho&s;e in others of them, whether the New-England colonies, or any other, are not; it may be properly &s;aid, that the charter <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> makes provi&s;ion for the former, but not for the latter; not even by <HI>implication,</HI> or any ju&s;t <HI>con&s;truction.</HI> That the New-England epi&s;co|palians were not in &s;uch a de&s;titute condition, is evident: Nor can this gentleman con&s;i&s;tently &s;ay they were. What|ever he may think about the apo&s;tolic in&s;titution of epi&s;|copacy, or the antiquity and u&s;efulne&s;s of liturgies; yet he does not &s;peak of the&s;e, as e&s;&s;ential to the being of chri&s;tian churches: He has far too much candor and good &s;en&s;e, to &s;uppo&s;e them &s;o. And &s;peaking of us congre|gationali&s;ts, he &s;ays expre&s;ly, <Q>Without maintaining that they have <HI>no go&s;pel mini&s;ters, or &s;acraments, or ordinances, or churches,</HI> we may apprehend,</Q> &amp;c. We have a right to con&s;ider this as a conce&s;&s;ion from him, that tho' we reject epi&s;copacy, the liturgy, and peculiar rites and u&s;ages of the church of England, yet we have &s;till truly <HI>go&s;pel mini&s;ters, &s;acraments, ordinances and churches.</HI> And if &s;o, no per&s;ons inhabiting the&s;e parts, whether epi&s;copalians or others, can ju&s;tly be &s;aid to <HI>lack, want</HI> or to be <HI>de&s;titute</HI> thereof; and for that rea&s;on, in danger of falling into <HI>athei&s;m</HI> or <HI>infidelity,</HI> or <HI>popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition</HI> and <HI>idolatry.</HI> So that, by his own con|ce&s;&s;ion, it appears that the charter makes no provi&s;ion, whe|ther expre&s;ly or implicitly, for &s;upporting epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;io|naries in the&s;e parts, for the &s;ake of the few epi&s;copalians living among us.</P>
<P>The gentleman, having acknowledged that the ca&s;e of the New-England epi&s;copalians <HI>is not particularly de&s;cribed and provided for in the charter,</HI> endeavours to guard again&s;t any u&s;e that might be made of this conce&s;&s;ion, to the preju|dice of his argument; which is not &s;trange. But I a little wonder at the method he has taken, to this end: For he immediately &s;ubjoins&mdash;<Q>But &s;o neither is the ca&s;e of any
<PB N="29" REF="009738_0028_0F7A4C1AE9CB5740">
other <HI>Indians,</HI> than &s;uch as are the King's <HI>&s;ubjects, and people living in his plantations and colonies;</HI> for to the&s;e only the letter of the charter extends.</Q> &amp;c. And yet the gentleman &s;ays, I am <HI>&s;o far from blaming the Society for applying part of their benefactions to the in&s;truction of &s;uch</HI> Indians <HI>as only border on his Maje&s;ty's dominions, that I blame them greatly for not applying more of it</HI> (he meant <HI>them) to that u&s;e.</HI> He goes on to argue, that the ca&s;e of the N. England epi&s;copalians may <HI>much more be looked on as comprehended within the intention of the charter,</HI> than the ca&s;e of the &s;aid bordering Indians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> But the&s;e ca&s;es are by no means &s;o nearly parallel, as they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be, by this way of rea&s;oning. For tho' neither the&s;e epi&s;copalians, nor the &s;aid Indians, are <HI>in terms</HI> provided for, or even men|tioned in the charter, (in which re&s;pect they are on the &s;ame footing) yet the Indians very fairly, and mo&s;t obviou&s;ly come within the intent of it; but the others do not. The&s;e Indians are unque&s;tionably de&s;titute of <HI>God's word</HI> and <HI>&s;a|craments;</HI> many of tho&s;e only bordering on our colonies, have actually profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and been for a long time treated with, as the King's <HI>&s;ubjects;</HI> and be&s;ides, the charter expre&s;ly authorizes the Society to u&s;e their be&s;t en|deavours to <HI>propagate the go&s;pel in tho&s;e parts,</HI> where the King has any plantations, &amp;c. Which clau&s;e has all along, and on all hands, been con&s;idered as having a &s;pecial refe|rence to the Indians, not only within the limits of the Bri|ti&s;h colonies, but bordering on them. There is then, no room for doubt, but that the Society act conformably, not only to the true de&s;ign, but even to the expre&s;&s;ion of the charter, in u&s;ing means in order to their conver&s;ion: Since tho' the&s;e Indians <HI>them&s;elves</HI> are not particularly mentioned, yet <HI>their ca&s;e</HI> is expre&s;ly provided for.

And having recour&s;e to this argument, &s;hews a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, at lea&s;t that &s;uch a conduct is not <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> and <HI>naturally</HI> reconciled with the charter: For if it were, &s;urely the defenders of the So|ciety would not plead for &s;o extraordinary a power, or &s;o very <HI>liberal</HI> a way of interpretation.

<P>The gentleman him&s;elf does not appear to be intirely &s;a|tisfied with this, which he calls an argument <HI>&agrave; fortiori.</HI> He therefore attempts, in the next place, to ju&s;tify the Society, as to the&s;e mi&s;&s;ions, by the very expre&s;&s;ions of the original charter.

Several things were &s;aid upon this point, fir&s;t in the <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> and then in the <HI>Defence</HI> of them. Let it now be farther remarked, that if the&s;e epi&s;copalians could properly be &s;aid to <HI>lack</HI> the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments, they would come, not only within the de&s;ign, but, in &s;ome &s;ort, within the letter of the charter; &s;ince it <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> provides for &s;uch of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in the colonies, as <HI>lack the admini|&s;tration,</HI> &amp;c. Whereas the gentleman, before, <HI>&s;eemed</HI> at lea&s;t to allow, that the charter did not make provi&s;ion for the ca&s;e of the&s;e people. But not to in&s;i&s;t on this conce&s;&s;ion at pre&s;ent, I think the&s;e people cannot be properly &s;aid to <HI>want</HI> the admini&s;tration, &amp;c. upon his own &s;uppo&s;ition, but to <HI>decline</HI> and <HI>di&s;approve</HI> of it. For he does not deny, but that we have <HI>go&s;pel mini&s;ters, &s;acraments, ordinances</HI> and <HI>churches</HI> here; of which they might enjoy the benefit, in
<PB N="31" REF="009738_0030_0F7A4C1CB5DDBFC8">
common with their chri&s;tian brethren, if they <HI>cho&s;e</HI> to do &s;o. How then could the epi&s;copalians among us, though there were no epi&s;copal churches here, be properly &s;aid, in the ge|neral terms of the charter, to <HI>want,</HI> or <HI>lack,</HI> the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments? If there had been any thing in the charter, to &s;hew that it meant the admini&s;tration of God's word, &amp;c. according to the particular u&s;age of the church of England, in oppo&s;ition to, or di&s;tinction from, all other prote&s;tant churches, as well as that of Rome; it is readily acknowledged, that this rea&s;oning would be good. But this is not the ca&s;e. What may be ju&s;tly &s;aid of the&s;e epi&s;copalians, is, that they <HI>di&s;like,</HI> and therefore will not at|tend on, the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments in our way: Which is quite a different thing from &s;aying, that they <HI>want,</HI> or are <HI>de&s;titute</HI> thereof. The difference is as great, as between a man's <HI>lacking</HI> daily food, and <HI>refu|&s;ing</HI> that which is before him, becau&s;e it is not cooked and di&s;hed up <HI>a la mode,</HI> or in a manner to plea&s;e his fancy.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the epi&s;copalians here, cannot with a <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> attend upon our mini&s;ters and their admini&s;trati|ons; and therefore that they <HI>want</HI> the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments, is by no means &s;atisfactory. As to the fact it&s;elf, that they cannot in <HI>con&s;cience</HI> attend upon them; I do not believe there is one in an hundred of them, who has ever declared, or that will <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> declare, that he thinks it <HI>&s;inful</HI> to do &s;o. They may generally, in their judgment, be it right or wrong, <HI>prefer</HI> the wor&s;hip and com|munion of the church of England to ours; and therefore think them&s;elves bound in <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> when both are in their power, u&s;ually to attend the former, as more for <HI>their</HI> edifi|cation. This they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to do, and in that re&s;|pect be ju&s;tifiable in their conformity to the church of En|gland, tho' it were allowed that they do not think it ab&s;o|lutely unlawful or criminal to wor&s;hip in our way, or to have communion with us in chri&s;tian ordinances; and could therefore do &s;o with a <HI>good con&s;cience,</HI> if there were no epi&s;|copal churches in the&s;e parts. I know, &s;ome of the weaker, the more bigotted and cen&s;orious &s;ort of them, declare that they could not in <HI>con&s;cience</HI> do this: But of the far greater part of them, I have not &s;o ill an opinion. Nor have I any rea&s;on to think that, in their applications to the
<PB N="32" REF="009738_0031_0F7A4C1D7637F588">
Society for mi&s;&s;ionaries, they have commonly made u&s;e of this plea; or gone any farther than to declare in general, their approbation and choice of the church of England com|munion, as mo&s;t for their edification: Which is a very dif|ferent thing from &s;uppo&s;ing ours ab&s;olutely unlawful and &s;inful.</P>
<P>If I am right in what I have here &s;ugge&s;ted, this argu|ment, drawn from <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> is of no force, being groun|ded on a fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition. But allowing that the&s;e epi&s;co|palians are generally &s;o &s;imple, bigotted or &s;uper&s;titious, that they cannot with a <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> attend upon God's word and &s;acraments with us, as this gentleman &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e; tho' they may be real objects of pity and com|pa&s;&s;ion, it appears not that they have any right to expect relief from the Society, their ca&s;e not being provided for in the charter, nor coming within the general de&s;ign of the In&s;titution: Which, plainly, was not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of prote&s;|tants of any particular denomination, living &s;cattered among greater numbers of other prote&s;tants, where provi&s;ion was made for the &s;upport of mini&s;ters, and the admini&s;tra|tion of God's word and ordinances; but <HI>only</HI> for per&s;ons de&s;titute of the&s;e advantages. The Scotti&s;h Society is of the two le&s;s limitted by its charter, than this in England. And yet if the &s;aid Society &s;hould annually expend perhaps a third part of their revenue, in &s;upporting, I will not now add, <HI>increa&s;ing,</HI> the presbyterian party, in tho&s;e plantations where the wor&s;hip of God is duly provided for, according to the church of England, and proportionably neglect peo|ple who were actually de&s;titute of God's word and &s;acra|ments in every prote&s;tant form; epi&s;copalians would, with|out doubt, univer&s;ally exclaim again&s;t this, as an abu&s;e and mi&s;application of their charitable fund; and as di&s;covering too great a fondne&s;s for a party, or particular &s;ect of pro|te&s;tants. Their pleading that the presbyterians, provided for by them, could not with a <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> acquie&s;ce in, or conform to the church of England, would, I am per|&s;uaded, be of very little weight with epi&s;copalians. Nor can any man &s;hew why this way of rea&s;oning is not as ju&s;t, when applied to the epi&s;copal Society in England, as when applied to the presbyterian Society in Scotland. The church of England is no more the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in one part of
<PB N="33" REF="009738_0032_0F7A4C1E3A430618">
Britain, than the kirk is in the other; King <HI>William</HI> was equally King of both parts; a charter conceived in the identical terms with that we are &s;peaking of, would have an&s;wered as well for a Presbyterian, as for an epi&s;copal So|ciety, only the names and titles of the Grantees being chan|ged: though &s;ome of the&s;e were actually presbyterians. Nor does it appear that the Grantor had it any more in his royal intention, that epi&s;copalians in &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces as are here &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;hould be provided for, than that presbyterians &s;hould, in the like circum&s;tances. From whence it may be concluded, that he either de&s;igned both, or neither: Let this gentleman make his choice&mdash;</P>
<P>But if there are numbers of epi&s;copalians among us, who cannot with a <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> hold communion with our churches in go&s;pel ordinances, it may be a&s;ked, What is to be done? is there no regular way of relief for them? I an|&s;wer, the &s;ame, and no other than there would be for pres|byterians or congregationali&s;ts in the like ca&s;e. If their num|bers and abilities are &s;uch, that they can &s;upport epi&s;copal mini&s;ters for them&s;elves, they not only have a right, but ought to do it. Or if they can make &s;uch repre&s;entations of their ca&s;e, (which, on the afore&s;aid &s;uppo&s;ition, is really an unhappy one) as to induce charitable people, in their <HI>private</HI> capacity, to give them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, no one will object again&s;t it. But if they can do neither of the&s;e things, there appears no <HI>regular</HI> way of relief for them; they mu&s;t pati|ently &s;ubmit to the providence of God, who has placed them in &s;uch circum&s;tances; waiting, either till <HI>more light</HI> removes their mi&s;takes and prejudices, or till their numbers and abilities are &s;ufficiently increa&s;ed, to &s;upport &s;uch mi|ni&s;ters as they chu&s;e to have. A Society incorporated for different purpo&s;es, (not for the &s;upport of any particular pro|te&s;tant &s;ect, as &s;uch) has no right to provide for them, to the neglect of &s;uch per&s;ons as are indi&s;putably the proper ob|jects of their in&s;titution.</P>
<P>But the gentleman, after ob&s;erving that the Society was incorporated, primarily, to prevent the King's &s;ubjects fall|ing into <HI>athei&s;m</HI> or <HI>infidelity,</HI> or into <HI>popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition</HI> and <HI>idolatry,</HI> &s;ays: Now doth not the Dr. think the epi&s;copalians, <Q>when they have no mini&s;ters in who&s;e mini&s;trations they can acquie&s;ce,</Q> mu&s;t be <HI>grievou&s;ly liable</HI> to the one or the

Upon which let me ob&s;erve, as to tho&s;e who are epi&s;copalians upon principle, or tho&s;e people &s;poken of by this gentleman, who cannot with a <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> wor|&s;hip God with us; that they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, at lea&s;t by epi&s;copalians, to be conver&s;ant in the holy &s;criptures, &s;eri|ous believers of them, devout wor&s;hippers of God in their hou&s;es, and real, practical chri&s;tians. Now &s;uch per&s;ons as the&s;e, per&s;ons of &s;o tender a <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> cannot &s;urely be thought in any imminent danger of apo&s;tatizing into <HI>athei&s;m</HI> or <HI>infidelity;</HI> e&s;pecially as they have the <HI>common-prayer|book</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their daily private devotions, and other <HI>pious</HI> books, not to &s;ay the Bible, to read and meditate on. Can &s;uch chri&s;tians as the gentleman &s;uppo&s;es our epi&s;copa|lians to be, and living in a chri&s;tian land, where the public wor&s;hip of God is upheld, be <HI>grievou&s;ly liable</HI> to turn athei&s;ts or infidels, even tho' they cannot acquie&s;ce in our way of wor&s;hip? I think not; and therefore, that the N. England mi&s;&s;ions cannot be vindicated upon this footing. I hope this gentleman will not, for the &s;ake of his argument, deny the epi&s;copalians here to be &s;uch good chri&s;tians as he has all along &s;uppo&s;ed them; or &s;ay that they have &s;o little knowledge or &s;obriety, that they are already on the brink of infidelity and athei&s;m; &s;o that, being without &s;uch mi|ni&s;ters as they can attend, they would be <HI>grievou&s;ly liable</HI> &s;oon to plunge into that horrible gulph. This would be, for the &s;ake of his logic, <HI>grievou&s;ly</HI> to reproach tho&s;e, who&s;e cau&s;e he is pleading. Be&s;ides, if they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;uch a profligate &s;ort of people, and &s;o void of <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> the argument which he draws from their &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>con&s;ci|entious</HI> non-compliance with our way of wor&s;hip, would be at once overthrown: It would de&s;troy it&s;elf, by its own incon&s;i&s;tency; and, indeed, taken any way, his rea&s;oning is &s;elf-repugnant.</P>
<P>But &s;ome of the&s;e good, con&s;cientious people, it is &s;aid, are grievou&s;ly liable, if not to <HI>athei&s;m</HI> and <HI>infidelity,</HI> yet to <HI>popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition</HI> and <HI>idolatry.</HI> 'Particularly,' adds the gentleman, <Q>mu&s;t not tho&s;e of them be in great danger of popery who, as he [<HI>meaning my&s;elf</HI>] tells us, prefer that to the wor&s;hip of the prevailing party in N.

number of epi&s;copalians here, &s;o deeply prejudiced again&s;t us, or who think &s;o favourably of the ma&s;s. Suppo&s;ing there may be 20 or 30 &s;uch per&s;ons in N. England, &s;catter|ed over a country of 3 or 400 miles in extent, can this be thought a &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on for &s;upporting 26 or 30 mi&s;&s;i|ons here, at a great expence? e&s;pecially when it is con&s;i|dered, that there are here no popi&s;h prie&s;ts or emi&s;&s;aries known of, further to pervert, and to confirm them papi&s;ts; but many people to di&s;&s;wade them from tho&s;e errors, and all worldly motives on the other &s;ide. There is no rea|&s;on to think that the Society ever had the ca&s;e of the&s;e N. England <HI>high-flyers</HI> in their mind, or con&s;equently, that they have &s;ent the more mi&s;&s;ionaries hither on their account. And if not, this cannot be properly u&s;ed as an argument to ju&s;tify their &s;ending them. I can hardly think the gentle|man is in earne&s;t, or thinks it a &s;olid one. He &s;eems to have laid hold on what I &s;aid of &s;ome few of the more bigotted epi&s;copalians among us, (whether he believed it or not, I cannot tell) as a plau&s;ible pretext for &s;upporting mi&s;&s;ions here. But the Society have <HI>apparently</HI> acted upon different principles, with other views and motives; not to keep the people of N. England from turning <HI>roman-catholick, dei&s;ts</HI> and <HI>athei&s;ts;</HI> (of all which there now is and ever was, much le&s;s danger than of the people of London doing &s;o.) but to &s;upport and &s;trengthen the epi&s;copal party, and gradually to bring us into the bo&s;om of the church; or, in the lan|guage of their own <HI>Account,</HI> <Q>to remove tho&s;e <HI>prejudices,</HI> under which the people generally laboured &amp; to promote, <HI>as much as po&s;&s;ible, an agreement in faith and wor&s;hip</HI></Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me add, that this plea of <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> as it has of late years been u&s;ed by the defenders of the Society's numerous mi&s;&s;ions in the&s;e parts, is the le&s;s &s;atisfactory upon this ac|count: There would, in all probability, have been hardly any of the&s;e <HI>&s;crupulous</HI> people among us at this day, had it not been for the Society; and if the mi&s;&s;ions were with|drawn, 'tis likely the far greater part of them might &s;oon return to the communion of our churches. Is it rea&s;onable that the Society, when there was but a handful of the&s;e people, as one may &s;ay, in all N.

till their numbers became much more con&s;iderable: And then avail them&s;elves of tho&s;e prejudices, to ju&s;tify their nu|merous mi&s;&s;ions here, under a notion that there are <HI>many</HI> peo|ple among us, who cannot with a <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> wor&s;hip God with us, and who are, for that rea&s;on, <HI>grievou&s;ly liable,</HI> without epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ionaries, to become <HI>athei&s;ts, infidels,</HI> or <HI>roman-catholicks?</HI> It may po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve to be con&s;i|dered, (I &s;ay it with much re&s;pect and deference to that venerable body) whether it would not have well become the Society, when applications were fir&s;t made to them for mi&s;&s;ionaries by people here, to hint to them, that their oppo&s;i|tion to our way of wor&s;hip might be too great; that they had better be content with it, till they &s;hould be &s;ufficiently numerous and able to &s;upport mini&s;ters them&s;elves, more agreeable to their principles and inclinations; that many other people &s;tood in much greater need of the Society's charitable care and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, being either &s;till in a &s;tate of heatheni&s;m, or wholly de&s;titute of the admini&s;tration of God's word and ordinances in <HI>any</HI> prote&s;tant way; and that therefore it ought not to be taken unkindly, if their reque&s;ts were not comply'd with. Had &s;ome &s;uch method been taken at fir&s;t, in&s;tead of countenancing a party &s;pirit, the Society would have had much more money to expend in &s;upporting the wor&s;hip of God in places de&s;titute of it, and chri&s;tianizing the Indians and Negroes; and there would probably have been but few per&s;ons among us at this day, but what could with a <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> hold communion with us; in which they would be as effectually guarded again&s;t athei&s;m, infidelity and popery, as in that of the church of England. But the Society have really contributed much towards &s;trengthening prejudices again&s;t us, and increa&s;ing this party; till their prejudices are grown to &s;uch an height, and their numbers are &s;o con&s;iderable, that a nece&s;&s;ity is now pleaded for continuing to give them large a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to pre|vent their becoming roman-catholics, infidels or athei&s;ts; becau&s;e, it is &s;aid, their <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> will not allow them to attend the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments in our churches. In which way of proceeding and rea&s;oning, the more mi&s;&s;ions are e&s;tabli&s;hed here, the greater will pro|bably be the demand for them; &s;ince tis likely there will be &s;ome increa&s;e of <HI>pro&s;elytes</HI> to the church, (to &s;ay nothing

of its increa&s;e <HI>by natural, ordinary generation</HI>) and therefore more &s;uch tender <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> to be con&s;idered: Till, in proce&s;s of time, the Society's whole fund may be too little to &s;upply N.

In which ca&s;e, the unprovided colonies and the heathens may reap the whole advantage of its benefactions; of which they have hitherto been in &s;o great a mea&s;ure deprived, for the &s;ake of the epi&s;copalians among us, at fir&s;t but few, and tho&s;e not, in any ju&s;t or proper &s;en&s;e, de&s;titute of the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments.</P>
<P>The gentleman &s;ometimes argues that the Society has formed no &s;uch de&s;ign as I have &s;uppo&s;ed, from this cir|cum&s;tance, that they did not &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries <HI>earlier</HI> into N. England, when there were but <HI>few church people</HI> here, and con&s;equently <HI>more need of mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> than afterwards, if making pro&s;elytes had been the point in view<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pag. 29.</NOTE> This is more plau&s;ible than &s;olid. They may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had the &s;aid de&s;ign before they &s;ent mi&s;&s;ionaries to pro&s;e|cute it; waiting only for a favourable occa&s;ion and opening. It would have been a romantic, <HI>Don-Quixote</HI> enterprize, for them to &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries hither for that purpo&s;e, be|fore there were a number of people ready to receive and embrace them. They mu&s;t have &s;ome footing, &s;ome ground <HI>to &s;tand on,</HI> in order, by their <HI>engines</HI> afore&s;aid, to &s;hake this part of the earth; and they were not, I conclude, &s;uch &s;tran|gers to the art and principles of <HI>Archimides,</HI> as to attempt it without. Nor does it appear, but that the Society embrac|ed the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> opportunity that offered, to e&s;tabli&s;h mi&s;&s;ions here. It is, I think, &s;ufficiently plain, that they had the de&s;ign afore&s;aid, as early as their <HI>Account</HI> was printed, 1706. But even tho' it could be proved, that they had it not for &s;everal years after the fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ions, it will not follow that they have not formed it &s;ince; being encouraged by the increa&s;e of the epi&s;copalian party here. And &s;uch a de&s;ign might very plau&s;ibly be carried on, under the notion of

It is only from this &s;en&s;e of the terms, that he can deduce any con&s;equences to the advantage of his cau&s;e. But he had offer'd nothing in confirmation of it, which ap|pears to me of any weight: I am therefore content to &s;ub|mit this matter to the judgment of our impartial readers, without adding any thing farther upon it. But I cannot but take a brief notice of one or two per&s;onal reflections on my&s;elf, in this part of his performance. He has, without grounds, and very ungenerou&s;ly, repre&s;ented it as my opi|nion, <HI>that whoever di&s;&s;ents from me in</HI> any point <HI>relative to chri&s;tian faith, is an</HI> HERETIC<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag 28.</NOTE>. And what a candid u&s;e he would make of this remark, appears from his words imme|diately following: <Q>His N. England brethren, <HI>if indeed they will acknowledge him for a brother,</HI> are DESIRED to con&s;ider the con&s;equences of this way of thinking. WE <HI>have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t.</HI></Q> Now, I am very far from thinking all tho&s;e heretics or heterodox, who di&s;&s;ent from me in <HI>any point</HI> relative to chri&s;tian faith. I have never given the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for &s;uch an a&s;per&s;ion. There is, I believe, no profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tian, of any denomination, le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to entertain hard thoughts of other people, merely on account of differences in opinion relative to points of faith, or who has been more remote from cen&s;uring and re|proaching tho&s;e who think differently, as heterodox or here|tical; neither of which opprobious epithets is, in my opinion, properly applied to any, but tho&s;e who <HI>pertinaciou&s;ly</HI> deny &s;ome one or more of the mo&s;t plain, indi&s;putable and impor|tant doctrines of the go&s;pel. It is thus, that I have <HI>learned Chri&s;t,</HI> and the &s;pirit of his religion. And whereas the gen|tleman intimates, that they of the church of England are

not accu&s;tomed to cen&s;ure as heretical, or ra&s;hly to judge and condemn others; let the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> creed, and the <HI>cannons</HI> of &s;aid church (according to many of which, people are to be <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> excommunicated for mere trifles) wit|ne&s;s, how very unlucky he was in &s;etting up tho&s;e of that communion, for patterns of chri&s;tian forbearance, or a ca|tholick di&s;po&s;ition; unle&s;s to <HI>catholic</HI> we prefix another epi|thet, very often <HI>joined</HI> therewith. In this, and &s;everal other places, the gentleman in&s;inuates plainly enough, that I am an heretic my&s;elf, and &s;o accounted by my <HI>brethren,</HI> if indeed they will at all <HI>acknowledge</HI> me for a brother. This piece of &s;candal was taken up, as I &s;uppo&s;e, upon the credit of &s;ome of the profligate writers who have lately appeared again&s;t me in N. England: It is no honor to this gentleman to repeat it after them; nor would it be at all to his advan|tage if one were, from &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages <HI>only</HI> as this, without con&s;idering the general tenor of his writing, to conjecture <HI>how he him&s;elf has learned Chri&s;t.</HI> And the&s;e reproachful innuendoes I take to be the le&s;s ingenuous, and more injuri|ous, as coming from him, becau&s;e, if I have received <HI>un|fraternal</HI> treatment from a <HI>few</HI> of my brethren, as indeed I have, this was chiefly becau&s;e I was &s;uppo&s;ed, whether truly or not, to approach too near, in &s;ome of my religious opinions, to tho&s;e of certain of the mo&s;t eminent bi&s;hops and other divines of the church of England, who were de&s;|pitefully treated as heretics by many of <HI>their</HI> brethren; and who&s;e names will be remembered with veneration, when tho&s;e of their [&s;uppo&s;ed] more orthodox revilers will either be forgotten thro' contempt, or remembered with execrati|on, like tho&s;e of the <HI>Lauds</HI> and <HI>Sacheverells</HI> of former times. The&s;e per&s;onal reflections of the gentleman, &s;eem to me quite unworthy of <HI>his</HI> pen; e&s;pecially &s;ince I think them unworthy of a more particular reply from &s;o mean a one as <HI>mine</HI>&mdash;The gentleman blames me, in the page la&s;t refered to, for intimating that our congregational mini|&s;ters generally adhere more clo&s;ely to the doctrinal articles of the church of England, than even her own clergy do.

There are but few churches or congregations of any denomination in America, &s;o able to maintain a mini&s;ter as this. I give this account upon good authority; and particularly upon the credit of a gentleman of principal di&s;tinction, belonging to that congregation, who, &s;ince the publication of my <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> and former <HI>Defence</HI> of them, gave me this account in conver&s;ation. He al&s;o frankly owned, that he looked on the Society's continuing to &s;upport a mini&s;ter for them, [at Newport] as an evident mi&s;application of their charity; and not the only one of the kind, in New-Eng|land. Without &s;peaking at pre&s;ent of any of the epi&s;co|pal congregations in Connecticut, let me ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the good people of <HI>Chri&s;t's Church</HI> in Bo&s;ton, tho' not &s;o rich or numerous as tho&s;e of the church at Newport, are yet, without doubt, more able to &s;upport a mini&s;ter, than

divers of our congregational churches in this metropolis. And if &s;upporting a mi&s;&s;ionary for them, be at all an abu&s;e, con&s;idering their own ability, and the exigence of other places, the abu&s;e is &s;till the greater, becau&s;e there are two other churches of England in the &s;ame town: Which churches are neither &s;o remote, nor &s;o thronged, but that the people of <HI>Chri&s;t's church</HI> might be accommo|dated in them; if not with &s;uch <HI>high pews</HI> or <HI>&s;eats</HI> as they might po&s;&s;ibly chu&s;e, yet &s;uch as, I &s;hould think, humble and good chri&s;tians, would rather take up with, than either violate their <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> by going to <HI>di&s;&s;enting meetings,</HI> or receive the Society's charity, of which &s;o many other people &s;tand in far greater need. If the venerable Society &s;hould conde&s;cend to pay any regard to the&s;e repre&s;entations, either &s;ome other per&s;on or my&s;elf, may probably be encouraged to mention other in&s;tances of abu&s;e, of a &s;imilar nature. But this I can hardly hope, when I con&s;ider what treatment the repre&s;entations of other <HI>non-conformi&s;ts</HI> have met with in times pa&s;t: This gives me le&s;s ground to expect <HI>thanks,</HI> than either &s;ilent neglect, or blame and reproof.</P>

I did not &s;ay, that the Society had in &s;ome &s;ort allowed the complaint again&s;t <HI>them&s;elves</HI> to be ju&s;t, as he &s;uppo&s;es; nor quote bi&s;hop <HI>Williams</HI> to prove this, but that the na|tives had <HI>actually</HI> been neglected.

But he has perverted my words and meaning in the &s;ame page, in a way that I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily apologize for: I mean, by &s;aying, that <HI>in one place I expre&s;s a doubt whether the Society have</HI> <Q>&s;o much as begun to u&s;e methods of converting either the Negroes or the Indians.</Q> Now in the place alluded to in the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> (p. 135) what I expre&s;&s;ed a doubt concerning, was not, whether the Society had begun to u&s;e <HI>any</HI> methods to this end, as his words plainly imply; but whether they had begun <Q>to &s;tudy, and to <HI>u&s;e diligently</HI> the mo&s;t probable methods of converting,</Q> &amp;c. In which &s;entence the chief empha|&s;is is put upon the words <HI>u&s;e diligently;</HI> which were accor|dingly before printed in <HI>italics;</HI> but which he has intirely omitted in his repre&s;entation of my &s;en&s;e: Whether for any better rea&s;on, than that he might make me appear to charge the Society with more negligence than I did, or thought of, he him&s;elf can be&s;t tell.</P>
<P>The gentleman goes on, from page 37 to 49, to &s;peak of the endeavours u&s;ed by the Society to chri&s;tianize the Indians and Negroes; of the difficulties and di&s;courage|ments attending this good work; and of the &s;uppo&s;ed inju&s;tice done the Society by me, in accu&s;ing them of any negligence in this re&s;pect. He has &s;aid many things very judiciou&s;ly and &s;olidly upon this head. And I frankly own, that, taking for truth what he has produced from Dr. <HI>Humphreys</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> (which I <HI>never &s;aw</HI>) relative to what the Society have done for the Indians, I u&s;ed &s;eve|ral expre&s;&s;ions, much too diminutive of the pains taken by them in this department. I am &s;orry I u&s;ed any expre&s;|&s;ions, whether for want of better information, or through ha&s;te in writing, which tended to lead my readers to think the Society had taken le&s;s pains than they actually have, towards the conver&s;ion of the Indians. Their endeavours to this end have been very con&s;iderable, according to the afore&s;aid <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> as cited by this gentleman. But &s;till I mu&s;t beg leave to think that, all things con&s;idered, much le&s;s has been done in this matter, than might have been rea&s;onably expected; and that much more probably would have been done, to the &s;piritual good of the natives, and

the great benefit of the Briti&s;h colonies, had not the So|ciety been &s;o deeply engaged, and &s;pent &s;o much of their revenue, in &s;upporting and increa&s;ing the epi&s;copal party, as &s;uch, in New-England. What the gentleman has offered as to Mr. (now Dr.) <HI>Barclay</HI>'s mi&s;&s;ion to the Iro|quois, his &s;mall encouragement from the Society, and being refu&s;ed a &s;chool-ma&s;ter and interpreter to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, ap|pears to me un&s;atisfactory. I will not, however, &s;pend time in controverting that matter; but am willing all &s;hould form a judgment, by comparing the extracts from Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI>'s own letters in the <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> with what this gentleman has offered upon the point.</P>
<P>He proceeds, page 49, 50 and 51, to &s;peak of what the Society has done for the &s;upport of God's public wor&s;hip in the <HI>unprovided</HI> colonies. I &s;hall not go into a particular con&s;ideration of what he has offered upon this head; partly, to avoid prolixity, and partly becau&s;e it is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e, if tho&s;e colonies and the natives have actually had &s;o much the le&s;s care taken of, and the le&s;s money employed for their benefit, in proportion to what has been taken of, and expended for, the New|England Epi&s;copalians; which is undeniable, &s;ince this money could not be employed in both the&s;e ways at once. Let me, however, ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that I can prove by a &s;ub&s;tantial living witne&s;s, that I received one account given by me of the repeated ineffectual applications of the <HI>North Carolinians</HI> to the Society for mi&s;&s;ionaries, from a gentle|man of principal di&s;tinction of that country; tho' I did not recollect, when I wrote the <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> that I could bring any per&s;on to atte&s;t to the truth of it, and &s;poke with a degree of caution, being unwilling to tru&s;t my own memory too far; at which this grave gentleman is plea&s;ed to make him&s;elf a little merry. If I am pub|licly called on, by any per&s;on who has a right to farther information, I will, for my own ju&s;tification, mention the <HI>name</HI> both of my informer, and the witne&s;s to whom I refer; tho' I flatter my&s;elf, that with tho&s;e who know me, this will be needle&s;s.</P>

The gentleman objects, page 52. again&s;t what I &s;aid of the <HI>&s;um</HI> expended by the Society in New-England; and &s;ays, I <HI>&s;hew the &s;ame inclination to exaggerate in this, as in every thing.</HI> Now he knew, becau&s;e I expre&s;ly &s;aid, I did 'not pretend to be very exact as to the <HI>quantum.</HI>' But yet he has offered nothing, to &s;hew I was under any mi&s;take in this re&s;pect; and I am per&s;uaded that I rather kept much within bounds, than exceeded them.

I know not how to account for this error; but &s;ure I am, that I was deceived my&s;elf, and had no de&s;ign to deceive others; as may well be &s;up|po&s;ed, from the very nature of the error. I willingly &s;tand corrected as to this. But let it be ob&s;erved, that this is a mi&s;take, which does not affect the main argument. For tho' but half, or much le&s;s than half &s;o many mi&s;&s;ions could have been &s;upported with the &s;um afore&s;aid, as I then &s;uppo&s;ed; &s;till a con&s;iderable number might, and, as I humbly conceive, ought to have been, for the benefit of the Indians, &amp;c. The que&s;tion is not, <HI>how much</HI> money has been mi&s;applied, or <HI>how many</HI> mi&s;&s;ions might have been &s;upported therewith, where they were mo&s;t needed; but whether any con&s;iderable &s;um has been, and whether that might not have been employed in ways plainly conformable to the charter. Unle&s;s the&s;e things are di&s;proved, it is of little con&s;equence to &s;hew, that I was mi&s;taken as to the other points.</P>

This is rendered the more probable, by what the gentleman adds a little after, &s;uppo&s;ing him not to be mi&s;taken in point of fact, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that <Q>&s;ome, if not many of them, have taken <HI>great pains</HI> to di&s;&s;uade members of the church of Eng|land from giving on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</Q> If any of them have really done &s;o, the mo&s;t natural account and &s;olution that can be given of it, is, that this money was, in great part, now found to be mi&s;applied, in &s;upporting and &s;trengthening the cau&s;e of epi&s;copacy, to the neglect of the heathen, &amp;c. and to the prejudice of their brethren in New-England. Surely, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the di&s;&s;enters would have had any objection again&s;t the So|ciety's being a&s;&s;i&s;ted in propagating the go&s;pel among the Indians and Negroes, or in &s;upporting the public wor&s;hip of God in places de&s;titute of it.

But Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> cited the bi&s;hop of <HI>St. David</HI>'s &s;ermon, apparently with this view; I mean in part. And tho' New-England is not particularly mentioned; yet, I think, the expre&s;&s;ions quoted by Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> will fairly admit of this con&s;truc|tion. I therefore took them in the &s;en&s;e which, I &s;up|po&s;ed, that gentleman did. Speaking of the Society's care to <HI>remedy the ill &s;tate of religion in our colonies,</HI> his Lord|&s;hip &s;ays, <Q>without this care, the conver&s;ion of the neigh|bouring Savages can hardly be effected</Q>. Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> applied this, as his argument required, to tho&s;e colonies, again&s;t the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ions in which, objections had been made; and the&s;e, all know, are principally the New-Eng|land colonies. With the &s;ame view he cited bi&s;hop <HI>Berk|ley</HI>'s &s;ermon, in which it is &s;aid, <Q>It &s;hould &s;eem the like|lie&s;t &s;tep towards converting the heathens, would be to begin with the Engli&s;h</Q>, &amp;c. And part of his citation from the pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury's &s;ermon be|fore the Society, has &s;o much the appearance of being to his purpo&s;e in this re&s;pect, that I cannot think it very &s;trange, if he conceived this to be the real &s;cope of it tho' it might not be &s;o. For, after &s;peaking of the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ions in places <HI>where there were already chri&s;tian &s;ocie|ties

<P>This re&s;pectable gentleman having &s;aid thus much, by way of <HI>An&s;wer to me,</HI> proceeds very candidly and oblig|ingly, page 57, <HI>to an&s;wer him&s;elf;</HI> at lea&s;t, to make &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions, and to apologize for the Society in &s;uch a way, as in a great mea&s;ure to ju&s;tify the complaints again&s;t its conduct.

And the gentleman well knows, I did not impute to them any <HI>known, wilful</HI> abu&s;e of their power, or mi&s;application of monies; but &s;tudiou&s;ly guard|ed again&s;t &s;uch a con&s;truction of my words: So that he has here acknowledged, in &s;ub&s;tance, the main point which I laboured to prove. He adds, ju&s;t after, with a &s;arca&s;tic air; <Q>Even the Doctor's two <HI>blamele&s;s Societies</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly exhibit &s;ome tincture of human frailty, if they did not <HI>warily</HI> keep their tran&s;actions <HI>unpubli&s;hed,</HI> whil&s;t tho&s;e of ours <HI>lie open to the world.</HI></Q> The Societies to which he alludes, can never need any defence of mine; e&s;pecially, not before he accu&s;es them of any thing, and only in&s;inuates that there <HI>might</HI> be grounds for it, if their tran&s;actions were made public. But &s;ince he &s;peaks of the&s;e, as <HI>warily</HI> kept in the dark, while tho&s;e of the epi&s;|copal Society <HI>lie open to the world;</HI> I cannot but ob&s;erve, that tho' <HI>Ab&s;tracts</HI> of their proceedings are annually <HI>printed</HI> with the &s;ermons, it is no ea&s;y thing for us non confor|mi&s;ts to get a &s;ight of them. It has been taken notice of by others, as well as my&s;elf, that the epi&s;copalians here are often very &s;hy and re&s;erved as to lending them; as if they apprehended, there were &s;ome things in them, which &s;hould not be <HI>too narrowly</HI> looked into; perhaps the mi&s;&s;io|naries letters; I know not. But it was partly for this rea&s;on, that in the year 1759, I applied to a Book-&s;eller in Bo&s;ton, to &s;end for 25 of the anniver&s;ary &s;ermons and ab&s;tracts for me. He accordingly wrote for them to his corre&s;pondent, a very noted Book-&s;eller in London, who&s;e an&s;wer is now in my hands, with his name &s;ub&s;cribed. In this he &s;ays, that <HI>the annual &s;ermons are things which are
<PB N="52" REF="009738_0051_0F7A4C308D417A78">
not to be bought;</HI> that <HI>had they been &s;o, money would have purcha&s;ed them;</HI> 'but as they are' (&s;o he expre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf) 'it is <HI>&s;olicitations</HI> that mu&s;t do it'. He adds, that <HI>he applied to Dr.</HI> Barecroft, <HI>the Society's &s;ecretary, for the &s;ermons,</HI> who told him, he had not the <HI>five fir&s;t</HI> &s;ent for; <HI>and as for the twenty la&s;t, unle&s;s he knew</HI> <Q><HI>the per&s;on</HI> they were for, he could not part with them; for as the Society printed them to di&s;tribute, and not to &s;ell, they had ordered him to do <HI>&s;o as to be of &s;ervice to the Society</HI></Q>. If need be, I will hereafter mention both the London and the Bo&s;ton Book-&s;eller by <HI>name.</HI> And from the foregoing little anecdote it may be inferred, that tho' <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the Society's tran&s;actions are annually print|ed, yet they do not lie altogether &s;o <HI>open to the view of the world,</HI> that the gentleman had any rea&s;on to boa&s;t there|of, in compari&s;on with the <HI>wary</HI> conduct of the other Societies. And one who deals in &s;u&s;picions and innuen|does like his, might hint, that if <HI>all</HI> of them did &s;o, this epi&s;copal Society might <HI>po&s;&s;ibly exhibit &s;ome tinctures of human frailty,</HI> even <HI>beyond</HI> what he has &s;o candidly ac|knowledged. But I cannot think in&s;inuations of this nature, ju&s;tifiable, by whom&s;oever u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The gentlemen goes on to <HI>excu&s;e</HI> the Society's &s;ending &s;o many more mi&s;&s;ionaries to New-England than was pro|per, even in his own opinion. He intimates that the epi&s;|copalians here, have been more <HI>pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitors</HI> than tho&s;e in other plantations: That when the earlier appli|cations were made, it could not be <HI>fore&s;een whether more would follow;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>mi&s;&s;ions became in&s;en&s;ibly nume|rous;</HI> and that <HI>when many reque&s;ts had been granted, it was the harder to refu&s;e others, for which the &s;ame plea could be made</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 58.</NOTE> It is owned that the&s;e things have weight, con&s;idered as an apology for what does not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, admit of a ju&s;tification. It is apparently with the former view, not the latter, that they are here intro|duced; and, con&s;idered in that light, I hope no man &s;hall be found more ready than my&s;elf, to acknowledge their pertinence, or to allow them their due force. The gen|tleman immediately adds another circum&s;tance of moment, con&s;idered in the &s;ame view. <Q>Some members of the
<PB N="53" REF="009738_0052_0F7A4C30F52B0DB0">
Society approved this increa&s;e [of mi&s;&s;ions;] others thought it was going <HI>too far.</HI> And in all bodies of men, who&s;e opinion differ, there mu&s;t be mutual conde&s;cen&s;i|ons, and time allowed for one &s;ide to come over into the &s;entiments of the other, el&s;e they cannot proceed together.</Q> This is &s;till apologizing, not ju&s;tifying. And hence it appears that, not only many people out of the Society, but a con&s;iderable number of its own members, have long thought its proceedings ami&s;s in this re&s;pect. The gentleman ought therefore, methinks, to judge candidly of the former; e&s;pecially &s;ince it &s;eems, by what he &s;ays, that tho&s;e members of the Society, who &s;o nearly agree with us in the main point, have at length convinced the others, in|duced them to <HI>come over into their &s;entiments,</HI> and thereby ratified the judgment of all, who tho't tho&s;e proceedings unju&s;tifiable. This is but a natural con&s;truction of the gen|tleman's words; who adds, a little after: <Q>And now, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, the Society have <HI>excu&s;ed</HI> them&s;elves from complying with <HI>any application from that quarter.</HI></Q> This, being compared with what was &s;aid ju&s;t before, about <HI>diffe|rence</HI> of opinion in the Society, and the need of <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ions.</HI> and <HI>time for one &s;ide to come over into the &s;entiments of the other,</HI> is &s;aying in effect, that the Society are now generally convinced, that tho&s;e of their members, who were again&s;t multiplying mi&s;&s;ions here, were in the right; and that, in con&s;equence hereof, they have <HI>excu&s;ed</HI> them&s;elves from &s;ending mi&s;&s;ionaries into the&s;e parts. I cannot but be very glad of the&s;e important hints. They at once ju&s;tify my&s;elf and others, who have objected again&s;t the&s;e mi&s;&s;ions, at lea&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure; and al&s;o afford grounds to hope, that this charitable fund will, for the future, be employed in ways more agreeable to its original de&s;ign, more bene|ficial to the world, and therefore more honourable to the Society. The gentleman adds: <Q>Surely this alone is no incon&s;iderable argument, that pro&s;elyting tho&s;e two di&s;|tricts to epi&s;copacy, hath not been the point in view.</Q> I confe&s;s, that if the Society &s;hould di&s;continue their mi&s;&s;ions here, it would be a good argument that they are <HI>no longer</HI> pro&s;ecuting that &s;cheme; but, how it would prove that they <HI>never</HI> had any &s;uch de&s;ign, is as much beyond my poor capacity, as to reconcile this &s;uppo&s;ition with their pa&s;t conduct, or with their own <HI>Account.</HI></P>

<P>To &s;peak for my &s;elf, then, I am one of tho&s;e who have been thus <HI>mi&s;informed;</HI> and I know of others who have been &s;o, in common with me. I did not &s;uppo&s;e, the <HI>true</HI> &s;cheme was, that American bi&s;hops &s;hould have <HI>no</HI> concern, but with <HI>epi&s;copalians;</HI> or that they &s;hould be wholly con|fined to the <HI>&s;acred</HI> offices afore&s;aid.

However, I will not <HI>retort</HI> the accu&s;ation; tho' it is my real opinion, that if this gentleman never degenerates from good &s;en&s;e into right down wit him&s;elf, he &s;ometimes makes alarming approaches towards it, and &s;hews at lea&s;t a &s;trong <HI>inclination</HI> thereto; in which, I &s;uppo&s;e, the e&s;cence of the <HI>&s;in,</HI> if it be one, chiefly con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>But to return: I pretend not particularly and certainly to know, what the real &s;cheme is, as to bi&s;hops in America. But certainly the non-conformi&s;ts at lea&s;t, of all denomina|tions, have great rea&s;on to deprecate the appointment of any <HI>&s;uch bi&s;hops</HI> here, as not only I had an idea of, when I tran&s;iently touched upon this &s;ubject before, but as I &s;up|po&s;e, people here have generally had in view, when this affair has been di&s;cour&s;ed of. The &s;cheme mentioned by this gentleman is, without doubt, liable to fewer objections; and he &s;peaks of it with great a&s;&s;urance, as if he were at <HI>head-quarters,</HI> and certainly knew this to be the <HI>real</HI> and <HI>only</HI> one. Po&s;&s;ibly this may be the ca&s;e: But he is not <HI>known;</HI> nor has he informed us, upon what ground or au|thority he goes, in giving this account of the matter. The declaration of an <HI>anonymous</HI> writer, how confidently &s;oever he may expre&s;s him&s;elf, is not, &s;urely, &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy us, that this is the <HI>true</HI> &s;cheme planned. How much re|gard &s;oever he might ju&s;tly claim, if he were known to be a per&s;on of that eminence and dignity, which &s;ome of his expre&s;&s;ions intimate him to be; yet while this is unknown,
<PB N="60" REF="009738_0059_0F7A4C39573CC2D0">
he will excu&s;e us if we do not intirely rely upon his word, that no <HI>other</HI> &s;cheme has been propo&s;ed. This may po&s;&s;ibly be only his own &s;cheme, the &s;cheme of a private man: And, till it comes from better authority, or in a more authentic way, we may con&s;ider it as an imaginary one, calculated to &s;erve a pre&s;ent turn, or to lull us into &s;ecurity as to bi&s;hops here, till, by the <HI>real,</HI> and much more <HI>fatal</HI> &s;cheme's be|ing carried into execution, it is too late to remon&s;trate.</P>
<P>But let us for the pre&s;ent take it for granted; that this gentleman's is the <HI>real</HI> and <HI>only</HI> &s;cheme. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that bi&s;hops are to be <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> &s;ent to America with &s;uch limited powers, to re&s;ide in epi&s;copal colonies, and to have no con|cern, but with epi&s;copalains: Have we &s;ufficient ground to think that they and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors would, to the day of doom, or for a long time, remain contented with &s;uch powers, or under &s;uch limitations? in a word, that they would continue &s;uch inoffen&s;ive, harmle&s;s creatures, as this gentleman &s;uppo&s;es; only diffu&s;ing <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> around them, on all manner of people <HI>&s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch holy impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> as are made by their <HI>hands</HI> on the good people in England; &s;o that we can rea&s;onably apprehend no mi&s;chief from them? Has this order of men been remarkable for a quiet, inoffen&s;ive behaviour? Have they u&s;ually been free from ambitious views and projects? from a di&s;po&s;ition to inter|meddle in &s;ecular, worldly matters, and to enlarge the &s;phere of their domination?&mdash;from attempts to encroach upon the rights of mankind, religious or civil? from in|triguing with princes, or the governors of countries, for their own advantage? from lending their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and joining with them, in carrying of &s;chemes of oppre&s;&s;ion? Is it natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that American bi&s;hops would long content them&s;elves in a condition &s;o inferior to that of their brethren, the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ors</HI> of the apo&s;tles in England?&mdash;without any of their temporal power and grandieur, &s;o as, in the eyes of mo&s;t people, to appear of a lower order; and con&s;equently wanting that authority and re&s;pect which, it might be pleaded, is needful?

for granted that, in the <HI>pre&s;ent admini&s;tration,</HI> there has been a di&s;covery of &s;o much wi&s;dom and integrity, of &s;uch a great regard to the <HI>liberties</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> of the &s;ubject, and, particularly, of <HI>&s;uch a tender concern for the intere&s;t and pro&s;perity of his Maje&s;ty's American colonies,</HI> as leaves us no room to fear an <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive enlargement of &s;piritual,</HI> or <HI>any other power,</HI> during the continuance of it: All this be|ing taken for granted, yet may not times alter, and admini|&s;trations change? Who knows what the next reign and ad|mini&s;tration may be? or whether attempts towards an op|pre&s;&s;ive enlargement of power, may not be as much encou|raged, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed they would be frowned on, during the pre&s;ent? We are certainly much more &s;ecure again&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion, in the ab&s;ence of bi&s;hops, than we &s;hould be if they were once fixed here. <HI>Ob&s;ta principiis,</HI> was ne|ver thought an ill maxim by wi&s;e men. Bi&s;hops being once fixed in America, pretexts might ea&s;ily be found, both for encrea&s;ing their number, and enlarging their powers: And the&s;e pretexts might probably be hearkened to, and prevail, on &s;uch a change of times as may be &s;uppo&s;ed. To &s;ay the lea&s;t, this is much more to be apprehended, that it is that, on &s;uch a change, bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent hither at fir&s;t with &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive powers, or powers that interfere with the pre&s;ent rights and privileges of the <HI>Coloni&s;ts.</HI> People are not u&s;ually deprived of their liberties all at once, but gra|dually; by one encroachment after another, <HI>as it is found they are di&s;po&s;ed to bear them;</HI> and things of the mo&s;t fatal tendency are often introduced at fir&s;t, under a comparative|ly plau&s;ible and harmle&s;s appearance.

<P>The gentleman con&s;iders as perfectly chimerical, the apprehen&s;ions which I formerly hinted, re&s;pecting the inconveniencies that might re&s;ult from the appointment of bi&s;hops in America: Particularly, that by the increa&s;e of the epi&s;copal party, they might get a majority in our hou&s;es of a&s;&s;embly; that, in con&s;equence hereof, the church of England might become the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of all the&s;e colonies; that a &s;acramental te&s;t, or &s;omething like it, might en&s;ue, to exclude non-conformi&s;ts from places, preferment, and all civil offices, as in England; and that taxes might be impo&s;ed on us all in common, for the maintenance of the&s;e bi&s;hops, and the epi&s;copal clergy. I did not, however, imagine that the&s;e dangers were very near at hand in New-England; nor do &s;o now, con&s;idering the &s;mall proportion that epi&s;copalians bear to prote&s;tants of other denominations. Should bi&s;hops be &s;ent, and the Society bend its whole force to increa&s;e the church a|mong us, it is not probable that the&s;e events would &s;pee|dily take place. But even remote evils may be rea&s;onably apprehended, as well as tho&s;e which are imminent; and are to be guarded again&s;t, as much as may be. That ap|pointing bi&s;hops for America, would be a probable means of increa&s;ing the epi&s;copal party here, will not be de|nied: This is doubtle&s;s one principal rea&s;on, why it is &s;o much de&s;ired; tho' neither this gentleman, nor the Society, &s;o far as I can at pre&s;ent recollect, has particularly mention'd it.

Can what is &s;uppo&s;ed rea&s;onable and equitable in Old England, be &s;uppo&s;ed unrea&s;onable and injurious in New?

<P>Be this matter as it may, while there is a law in force, which bears &s;o hard on prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, as the te&s;t does, I &s;hall not ea&s;ily be per&s;waded, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible, if the hierarchy was not already provided for, to obtain an act for that purpo&s;e, by which the burthen &s;hould be laid upon di&s;&s;enters in common with others; which, in &s;ome re&s;pects, might be thought a le&s;s grievance than the other: Particularly as it would be much le&s;s <HI>re|proachful</HI> and <HI>ignominious</HI> to them, to be only obliged to pay to the &s;upport of a clergy di&s;approved by them, than to be treated as if they did not merit the character, and were therefore unworthy to enjoy the privileges, of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; tho' it is well known, his Maje&s;ty, whom God pre&s;erve, has none more loyal and faithful. But to return: If bi&s;hops are &s;ent to America, they mu&s;t be well &s;upported; this is beyond doubt. By whom? or by what means?

The church of England had an exclu&s;ive legal e&s;|tabli&s;hment, at the time &s;poken of; the King for her Head, and &s;worn Protector, and almo&s;t all per&s;ons, of intere&s;t and power for her members. Conformity was almo&s;t, if not the only path to preferment, civil honors, offices and emo|luments. In &s;hort, the con&s;titution both in church and &s;tate was &s;o &s;ecured, &s;o guarded both by laws and numbers, and non conformi&s;ts were &s;o few, and under &s;uch di&s;advan|tages, that there was not room for any fear that they would ever increa&s;e &s;o as to become the major and leading part in parliament, or be able, if they de&s;ired it, to over-turn the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and oppre&s;s epi&s;copalians. Apprehen&s;ions of this fort, would indeed have been perfectly <HI>chimerical</HI> at that time; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the di&s;union on non-conformi&s;ts among them&s;elves, and the moral impo&s;&s;ibility of their unit|ing, in e&s;tabli&s;hing any other particular form of church go|vernment. What parity? what &s;imilitude is there between the circum&s;tances of New England and Old, in the&s;e re&s;|pects? The ca&s;es are &s;o widely different, that it is &s;trange a gentleman of &s;o much penetration and acumen &s;hould, by his manner of rea&s;oning, &s;uppo&s;e them parallel. We have no <HI>&s;uch</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, as that of England; and, I hope, never &s;hall. Our churches have no royal Head and Protector, in the &s;en&s;e which that has;&mdash;<HI>only</HI> ONE <HI>in heaven,</HI> whom we pray to be the <HI>Protector</HI> of the other. We are not an independent people, or &s;overeign &s;tate, but de|pendent on England, wherein epi&s;copacy is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and which we honor and obey, as our mother-country. Our Governor, and all provincial Governors appointed by the crown, I &s;uppo&s;e are, and by law mu&s;t be, conformi&s;ts to the church of England. A con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons, even in the N. England colonies, are per&s;ons of much wealth, influence and power. In mo&s;t of the colonies, the re&s;pective Governors have all military offices at their free di&s;po&s;al and the nomination to civil; and in &s;ome, a negative on the choice of councellors. They mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed, as a thing of
<PB N="69" REF="009738_0068_0F7A4C4177BFF518">
cour&s;e, mo&s;t to favor epi&s;copalians; &s;o that conformity, in&s;tead of being a bar to preferment here, is perhaps gene|rally found the readie&s;t way to it. Epi&s;copalians may be, and often are, cho&s;en members of both hou&s;es of a&s;&s;embly in the colonies of New England; nor is there either law, or any thing el&s;e, to prevent this, if, by their qualifications and good behaviour, they can recommend them&s;elves to the electors. And I hope this gentleman would not have the people <HI>obliged</HI> by law to chu&s;e them, whether they ap|prove of them or not; tho' this &s;eems to be the amount of what he &s;ome-where &s;ays. Be&s;ides, the epi&s;copalians here are more united among them&s;elves than we are, being of different &s;ects and parties. And &s;hould they [epi&s;copalians] hereafter approach any thing near to an equality with us in point of number, they will have the advantage greatly in this re&s;pect; &s;ince they may more ea&s;ily unite their &s;trength, in pur&s;uing mea&s;ures for their &s;eparate advantage, and to <HI>our</HI> common detriment, than we &s;hall our's, in any particu|lar methods of oppo&s;ition to them: So that they may carry their points, even with <HI>inferior</HI> numbers; e&s;pecially being mo&s;t favour'd by an epi&s;copal Governor, who&s;e influence is ordinarily very great <HI>out of court,</HI> as well as his proper con&s;titutional power <HI>in it.</HI></P>
<P>Our circum&s;tances being &s;uch, is there not a hundred, a thou&s;and times, more rea&s;on to apprehend that epi&s;copali|ans may in time become the major and governing party here, and enact &s;uch laws as I have been &s;peaking of, than there was at the <HI>revolution,</HI> that the non-conformi&s;ts in England might do the like there? I can hardly think that the gentleman, upon a little reflection, will di&s;own it. Which being the ca&s;e, the grand principle on which he &s;ets out, in &s;peaking of American bi&s;hops, is not applicable to the &s;tate of the&s;e colonies; at lea&s;t, not by far, very far, &s;o applicable as it was and is to that of England. The principle I intend, is this. That <Q>all members of every church are, according to the principles of liberty, intitled to <HI>every part</HI> of what they conceive to be the benefits of it, intire and compleat, <HI>&s;o far as con&s;i&s;ts with the welfare of civil government</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 59.</NOTE>.

<P>But one thing mentioned by this gentleman, in order to reconcile us to this &s;cheme, had almo&s;t e&s;caped me.

If popi&s;h bi&s;hops exerci&s;e their function in England <HI>without ob&s;ervation,</HI> as the gentleman &s;ays, it is not indeed &s;trange, if they do it al&s;o <HI>without offence.</HI> But I cannot readily comprehend what he means by &s;aying, that they do this <HI>without ob&s;ervation,</HI> when at the &s;ame time he &s;peaks of it as a notorious fact: Tho' his meaning cannot be mi&s;taken, when he &s;ays, this is done <HI>without offence.</HI> It mu&s;t be, that it gives no con&s;iderable umbrage or jealou&s;y, but that the people, at lea&s;t tho&s;e of higher rank, are con|tented it &s;hould be &s;o. For he &s;peaks of this as an in&s;tance and proof of the mutual candor, forbearance and modera|tion,
<PB N="71" REF="009738_0070_0F7A4C42F466C798">
which prevail at this day in England, among chri&s;tians of different denominations; and &s;o, as a rea&s;on why we &s;hould be well &s;atisfied with having bi&s;hops of the church of England in the&s;e parts. But if this proves any thing, it proves too much; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that we &s;hould be content to &s;ee, not only Engli&s;h, but popi&s;h bi&s;hops, freely exerci&s;ing their functions among us; the latter of which is not agree|able to our charter and laws. And tho' I am a warm friend to religious liberty in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e; and tho' mutual forbearance cannot be too much recommended, where the differences are <HI>merely</HI> of a <HI>religious</HI> nature, or &s;uch as do not affect the liberty, &s;afety and natural rights of mankind; yet I mu&s;t own, I hope never to &s;ee popi&s;h bi&s;hops thus going about <HI>without offence,</HI> in New-England; being per&s;uaded, from the very nature of divers popi&s;h tenets, that roman catholicks cannot be &s;afely tolerated in the free exerci&s;e of their religion, in a prote&s;tant government. And, if I may be permitted to make a &s;ort of digre&s;&s;ion here, does not the prevalence of popery in England, afford mat|ter for very &s;erious reflexions? The papi&s;ts, only in Lon|don, were by computation an hundred thou&s;and, in the year 1745. Since which, their numbers are va&s;tly increa&s;|ed there, and in other parts of the kingdom; the people being, as it is &s;aid, perverted by popi&s;h bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts, je&s;uits &amp;c. by hundreds and thou&s;ands, if not ten thou|&s;ands, yearly. Nor is this, as it &s;eems, done in &s;ecret, and in corners; but openly and boldly, as this gentleman intimates. And has not a <HI>very large</HI> ma&s;s-hou&s;e been built &s;ince 1745, in Stanhope-Street, London, contiguous to the hou&s;e of the Neapolitan amba&s;&s;ador; which has a door al|ways open to another &s;treet, on purpo&s;e to <HI>accommodate the public?</HI> What is become of the &s;mall, old, crazed popi&s;h chapel, call'd the Sardinian chapel?

<P>I am far enough from pretending to know, farther &s;till from pre&s;uming to &s;ay, what the true &s;tate of things <HI>now</HI> is in England. But it is &s;ufficiently apparent, what have in times <HI>pa&s;t</HI> been the rea&s;ons why the pernicious practi|ces of papi&s;ts, and the increa&s;e of popery there, have been winked at. At &s;ome times the King and the mini&s;try, the principal bi&s;hops, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tic dignitaries, to|gether with &s;ome of the magi&s;trates, have &s;eemed really inclined to a thoro' coale&s;cence with the church of Rome: Witne&s;s &s;ome, at lea&s;t, of the <HI>Stuart</HI>-reigns. At other times, it &s;eems, a corrupt, abandon'd mini&s;try have both had occa&s;ion for, and by concert received, the parliamen|tary intere&s;t of the wealthier papi&s;ts: In con&s;equence of which, and as a grateful return for the favor, (if &s;uch per|&s;ons can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any gratitude) they have wholly connived at the practices and perver&s;ions of pa|pi&s;ts. The magi&s;trates of cour&s;e became le&s;s watchful more remi&s;s and inactive. The clergy, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of &s;uperior rank, and who aimed at riches or higher pre|ferment, or both, ob&s;erving this conduct of the mini&s;try, and the path nece&s;&s;ary <HI>in commendam,</HI> wholly connived al&s;o at the practices of papi&s;ts, and the progre&s;s of popery; except perhaps they <HI>coldly</HI> appeared again&s;t them on cer|tain days and occa&s;ions, of mere nece&s;&s;ity and form. So that, at &s;uch times, cruel, blood-thir&s;ty and rebel-hearted roman-catholics, had hardly any oppo&s;ition made to them, or any thing to fear in England, either from law or go&s;|pel.

A few learned, hone&s;t and active men, who aimed le&s;s at preferment in the church, than at the &s;afety and good of their country, have indeed &s;tepped forth at &s;uch times, to oppo&s;e this ma&s;ter-hydra of popery: But be|ing mo&s;tly poor, with little influence or intere&s;t, and un|&s;upported by their &s;uperiors, who ought to have been foremo&s;t in this oppo&s;ition, the public received but little benefit from their virtuous and heroic endeavours, exerted to a certain detriment in their promotion, and to their per&s;onal di&s;advantage. By &s;uch-like means has the <HI>Scar|let Whore,</HI> with whom the Kings and great men of the earth have committed <HI>fornication,</HI> at certain &s;ea&s;ons got fairly mounted on her <HI>borned bea&s;t,</HI> and rode, with the cup of <HI>abominations</HI> in her hand, almo&s;t triumphant thro' England: Seeming to want only a little more time, and a favourable concurrence of circum&s;tances, by means of foreign or dome&s;tic broils and jarrings, to &s;hew her exe|crable, infernal face in its mo&s;t hideous attitudes, and to exert a bloody, fiery, diabolical &s;trength; the utmo&s;t con|&s;equences of which, no one could fore&s;ee, but all had great rea&s;on to dread! Such has heretofore been the &s;tate of things in England. How it is at pre&s;ent, I pre|tend not particularly to know. But, as was intimated be|fore, I could wi&s;h that my penetrating and able opponent, who is on the &s;pot, had explained him&s;elf a little farther, when he hinted that popery was fa&s;t gaining ground there, and appeared &s;o boldly; yet <HI>without offence!</HI> For this digre&s;&s;ion, methinks, he ought to be partly re&s;pon&s;ible, &s;ince he gave the occa&s;ion; and I hope he will be &s;o good as to &s;hare the blame with me. It is not, however, I think, entirely foreign, from my &s;ubject, as was hinted before: For, &s;urely, bi&s;hops, or other per&s;ons who are &s;o little inimical to popery, as to take no <HI>offence</HI> at popi&s;h bi&s;hops going about to exerci&s;e <HI>every part</HI> of their func|tion in England, if this be really the ca&s;e, are not likely to be of much &s;ervice to the prote&s;tant religion, in the character of bi&s;hops in America.

<P>I have freely and fully laid open my thoughts, &s;uch as they are, re&s;pecting the New England mi&s;&s;ions.

<P>I hope I have not treated the gentleman with any rude|ne&s;s or indecency. There is much good &s;en&s;e, good tem|per, candor and chri&s;tian catholici&s;m di&s;covered in various parts of his Tract. The venerable Society, I believe, ne|ver had &s;o able, and never will have a more able defender:

<P>He has, I think, once or twice expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf <HI>civilly</HI> even of me, tho' never without blaming me at the &s;ame time. I would not be wanting in a &s;uitable return: But if it &s;o happens, that the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of atten|ding to any gentleman's rea&s;oning, is his appearing &s;ome|times in a le&s;s advantageous light than at others, it is not difficult to &s;ee where the blame lies. Nor is the differ|ence &s;mall, between going out of one's way, on purpo&s;e to give murderous thru&s;ts to the <HI>reputation</HI> of a writer, and barely not preventing him from being too carele&s;s of it him&s;elf, and u&s;ing it very unkindly, by undertaking to defend what is not defen&s;ible. This performance is doubtle&s;s, in all re&s;pects, much &s;uperior to any of tho&s;e which <HI>fir&s;t</HI> appeared again&s;t the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> in America.

I can, however, hardly &s;uppo&s;e, that if he had ever &s;een certain outrageous publications of the American epi&s;copalians again&s;t me, relating to the Society and the church, he would have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;o cautious and tender a manner as he has there done, after having reproved and admoni&s;hed me, with &s;ome &s;everity, <HI>tho' only for my good:</HI> Since he is doubtle&s;s as <HI>kindly</HI> di&s;|po&s;ed towards <HI>them,</HI> as towards me. <Q>IF any writers on <HI>our &s;ide,</HI></Q> &s;ays he, <Q>have been <HI>le&s;s cool,</HI> or <HI>le&s;s civil,</HI> than they ought, and <HI>de&s;igned</HI> [<HI>to be &s;ure</HI>] to have been, we are &s;orry for it, and exhort them to <HI>change their &s;tile,</HI> if they write again.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 68.</NOTE> Methinks, One that appears partly in the character of a <HI>moderator</HI> and <HI>peace-maker</HI> among warm di&s;putants, ought, not only to ab&s;tain from all &s;uch contemptuous and opprobrious language as he blames in them, but to be <HI>impartial</HI> in his reproofs and admonitions. For which rea&s;on I conclude, this worthy gentleman was an utter &s;tranger to &s;ome late writings of the epi&s;copalians here; which would, no doubt, if he had &s;een them, have extorted even from a per&s;on of his mild, meek and gentle di&s;po&s;ition, a <HI>&s;harp rebuke,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;uch a <HI>gingeri&s;h exhortation.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> kept to his prudent re&s;olution, 'once for all;' and has been <HI>dead</HI> as to this di&s;pute, ever &s;ince he began it in form; this gentleman has revived the <HI>remembrance</HI> of him, by &s;ometimes mentioning him, endea|vouring to defend divers of his mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable po&s;itions, and blaming me for treating him 'unmercifully,' &amp;c. All which I con&s;ider as the effect of his great <HI>humanity,</HI> rather than the re&s;ult of his <HI>deliberate</HI> judgment. And tho' I have had frequent occa&s;ions, yet I have, as much as po&s;&s;ible, avoided &s;peaking of that gentleman; le&s;t, in my own vindication, I &s;hould have been almo&s;t obliged to tran&s;gre&s;s the old maxim, <HI>De mortuis nil ni&s;i bonum.</HI></P>

I think, whatever faults I may have, (would to God they were much fewer!) I am not of a temper deliberately to ju&s;tify any thing, too ha&s;tily

&s;aid or done by me, after being convinced of the error. Tho' I may be thought to have &s;aid &s;ome har&s;h things about the members of the church of England, and am often blamed in that re&s;pect by my worthy <HI>An&s;werer;</HI> I have repeatedly declared, and again declare, that I highly re&s;pect and honor many of them, as per&s;ons of great probity, piety and good|ne&s;s; particularly among tho&s;e who were <HI>educated in that way.</HI> Whatever my opinion may be of the con&s;titution and wor&s;hip of &s;aid church, I &s;hould be extremely glad to &s;ee a friendly, obliging intercour&s;e pre&s;erved between her members among us, and people of our own per&s;ua&s;ion! And notwith&s;tanding I am taxed with being uncharitable to, and <HI>vehement</HI> again&s;t them; I can &s;ay, with the &s;ince|rity becoming a chri&s;tian, that whenever I happen to have any concern with any of them, who appear to me to be per&s;ons of principle and candor, not over-bearing and a&s;&s;uming, but willing to treat non-conformi&s;ts as their fellow-chri&s;tians and brethren; I take a very particular plea&s;ure in &s;hewing them all the tokens of affection, e&s;teem and honor. But, I &s;ay it at once with grief and reluctance, I have much <HI>&s;eldomer</HI> found per&s;ons of this character among them, than I could have wi&s;hed to do; and con|tempt and di&s;dain on one &s;ide, very often produce the &s;ame on the other. However, I recollect a very ju&s;t ob&s;erva|tion of the gentleman, to this purpo&s;e, That people of different religious &s;ects and parties may <HI>think</HI> much too <HI>ill</HI> of, without at all <HI>wi&s;hing ill</HI> to, each other. Both the&s;e are faults, which ought to be carefully guarded again&s;t: If I have ever fallen into the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> I hope I am not chargeable with the <HI>&s;econd;</HI> which is far the mo&s;t crimi|nal and inexcu&s;eable. I likewi&s;e hope, we &s;hall on all hands, as far as po&s;&s;ible, put on that charity which <HI>think|eth no evil;</HI> which <HI>&s;uffereth long,</HI> and is <HI>kind;</HI> which <HI>envieth not, vaunteth not it&s;elf,</HI> is not <HI>puffed up;</HI> which doth not <HI>behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly; rejoiceth not in iniquity;</HI> but <HI>rejoiceth in the truth.</HI> No one can read the &s;acred oracles, unle&s;s he is &s;piritually blind, without clearly &s;eeing, that tho' we had all faith, as well as all knowledge, &s;o that

<P>And thus I take leave for the pre&s;ent, I hope forever, of this controver&s;y, of which I am heartily weary; tho' not from a conviction that I have been on the wrong &s;ide, in any material point. If any per&s;on, without having &s;ome|thing that is both <HI>new</HI> and <HI>weighty</HI> to offer upon it, &s;hall write and publi&s;h, merely for the &s;ake of having the <HI>la&s;t word,</HI> I beg to excu&s;e my&s;elf from being his opponent: I will not contend with him for that <HI>point of honor;</HI> e&s;pecially

if he will be &s;o <HI>ingenuous</HI> as to own, that he writes for <HI>that end.</HI> The author is not &s;olicitous, on who&s;e &s;ide the <HI>la&s;t word</HI> is, if barely the <HI>truth</HI> is on his. If, by any thing hereafter publi&s;hed, he &s;hould be convinced that he has been materially in the wrong, he will publickly acknow|ledge it; and give the venerable Society all the &s;atisfaction in his power: But One who has written &s;o much upon the &s;ubject already, may &s;urely be contented hereafter with only <HI>thinking him&s;elf in the right,</HI> without again telling the world his opinion.

<P>THE foregoing <HI>Remarks</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly fall into the hands of &s;ome public-&s;pirited gentlemen of ample fortunes, abroad; who heartily wi&s;h well to New-England in all re&s;pects, and particularly as to the encouragement and increa&s;e of <HI>Learning</HI> here. The Author therefore, not without the ad|vice and reque&s;t of &s;ome gentlemen among us, who&s;e opinion has much weight with him, takes this opportunity ju&s;t to mention the very grievous lo&s;s which <HI>Harvard College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> near <HI>Bo&s;ton, New-England,</HI> lately &s;u&s;tained in the en|tire de&s;truction of one of its buildings by fire, to|gether with the whole and valuable <HI>Apparatus</HI> for experimental Philo&s;ophy; and al&s;o the whole public <HI>Library</HI> (a very valuable one) excepting a few books which happened to be out of it at that time. The friends of Learning and of New-England, who may be both able and charitable, need not be informed how gratefully and re&s;pectfully any ex|pre&s;&s;ion of their good-will to &s;aid College, to|wards repairing &s;o heavy a lo&s;s, would be received.</P>
