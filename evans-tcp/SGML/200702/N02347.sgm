<HEAD>An Account of the Life and Death of Jo&s;eph Qua&s;&s;on, Indian, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WE begin with the Account which the Pri&s;oner gave of him&s;elf, not many Days before his Execution, which Relation was taken from his Mouth by a faithful and careful Scribe; after the Relator had expre&s;&s;ed Reluctancy in &s;uch Terms as the&s;e&mdash;<HI>To tell the World,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what a &s;tupid hardned Creature I have been! What will they &s;ay? There's a wicked Wretch gone to Hell!</HI>&mdash;But being told God might yet do more for him, to be added to the Account afterwards; and that the Communication of the&s;e Things, to be publi&s;hed, might be for the Glory of God and good of Souls; he con&s;ented, and

in An&s;wer to various and &s;uitable Que&s;tions propounded to him, as there was found Occa&s;ion. He &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>I was born at a Place called <HI>Monamoy, March</HI> 28. 1698. Lived with my Parents &s;ix Years; Then my Father died five Pounds in Debt to Mr. <HI>Samuel Sturges</HI> of <HI>Yarmouth.</HI> I was bound out to him by my Mother on that Account; where I was, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble, in&s;tructed in Reading and in my Cate|chi&s;m. My Mi&s;tre&s;s u&s;ed to tell me, I mu&s;t never Sin, for, Hell was a dreadful Place, where the Workers of Iniquity mu&s;t go. I had then great Fear of Sin. I thought it was a dreadful Thing to tell a wilful Lye, and I don't remember that I then allowed my &s;elf in any external Way of Wickedne&s;s; &s;uch as Lying, Swearing, Stealing, &amp;c. which was from the Re&s;traints of God upon me. When I have heard the Lord's Name taken in vain by Children, I have reproved them for it; and told them it was a Sin. When I was about thirteen Years old, I had the Care of my Ma&s;ter's Warehou&s;e: I was tempted by &s;ome young 'Prentices to &s;teal Powder for them; but I refu&s;ed, yet I re|member I &s;uffered &s;ome of them to do it, which troubled me afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002782_0004_0FE63373225D8FC8">
I never drank to Exce&s;s, till I eighteen Years old, when I was once overtaken; but I had not got an Habit of it, till my Time was out with my Ma&s;ter: I was always un|der &s;uch a &s;trict and regular Government Night and Day, that I had no Opportunity for it.&mdash;I u&s;ed in the Time of my Service, oftentimes to have thought of another World; and u&s;ed to be concerned about get|ting ready for Death. I u&s;ed to Read and think of Praying to God; but thought I could I could not do that, nor did I ever pray by my &s;elf, till I came into this Pri&s;on. I was obliged con&s;tantly to hear the Word preached, whil&s;t with my Ma&s;ter; and was often much affected. I loved to hear the Word, and continued to do &s;o 'till <HI>I</HI> gave way to Company and Drinking; which was &s;oon after <HI>I</HI> had my Freedom. <HI>I</HI> went from my Ma&s;ter very well clothed, and had, a|mong other Things, a new Bible given me. <HI>I</HI> work'd a little, at fir&s;t; but grew <HI>I</HI>dle, and took to Spending, and &s;old my Cloaths and other Things; and even my Bible, to maintain my Lu&s;ts. My Drunkenne&s;s hurt my Con&s;cience very much at fir&s;t; but after a while all was quiet: <HI>I</HI> could &s;in without remor&s;e; and when <HI>I</HI> had brought my &s;elf
<PB N="4" REF="002782_0005_0FE63373267EC450">
into a poor and ragged Condition, I left the Engli&s;h Meeting through Shame, where <HI>I</HI> always u&s;ed to appear well clothed: <HI>I</HI> went to the <HI>Indian</HI> Meeting (where <HI>I</HI> under&s;tood nothing) only to &s;ave my Fine.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>I</HI> went on in my Wickedne&s;s 'till the Spring of the Year 1725. without any &s;eri|ous Reflection; Then <HI>I</HI> had Thoughts running in my Mind, e&s;pecially after <HI>I</HI> had been overtaken with Drink, as if one had &s;poken to me; if <HI>I</HI> did not leave off this Practice, it would quickly bring me to Ruin. It was a Warn|ing, <HI>I</HI> &s;uppo&s;e: but it had little Effect. I could not (becau&s;e <HI>I</HI> would not) cea&s;e from Sin, (This was after <HI>I</HI> came out to the Ea&s;tward, a Soldier) <HI>I</HI> was more and more &s;ettled, hardned and &s;o, quiet in my &s;inful Cour&s;es 'till the Fact was committed, for which I mu&s;t die. About three Weeks be|fore I killed the Man, I had, one Day, a Thought come into my Mind, That I had been guilty of all manner of Sin, I could then think of none that <HI>I</HI> was free from, but the Sin again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and I did not know but I had committed that too: But then I thought of the Sin of Murder, which I had not, outwardly, committed. Now I have committed that Sin too.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002782_0005_0FE63373267EC450">
I was at Work with a Man at Cape <HI>Porpus,</HI> about a Fort'ni't before I killed <HI>John Peter,</HI> and in Di&s;cour&s;e, he a&s;ked me, what I tho't of my &s;elf&mdash;and if the Indians &s;hould kill me, whither I thought I &s;hould go. I an&s;|wered him, That I &s;hould go to Hell, be&s;ure. He asked me, Why? I reply'd, Becau&s;e I &s;hould have no Time to con&s;ider and Repent. And <HI>I</HI> remember I then thought, if I had but Time, I &s;hould find it no hard Matter to Repent. And &s;o after I was apprehend|ed, and began to think I mu&s;t Die; I tho't and &s;aid, I hoped God would give me Time to Repent, but I had no Sen&s;e that God mu&s;t al&s;o give me an Heart to Repent. I was a|bout &s;ix Days in Pri&s;on before I heard of the Death of the Indian. I &s;pent my Time in reading the Bible and other good Books (and indeed I was wont often to read before this) but never Prayed before my Impri&s;onment, nor after, 'till the dreadful News that <HI>John Peter</HI> was dead of his Wounds, came to my Ears&mdash;. Then I was greatly terrified and amazed with the Apprehen&s;ions of Death, which <HI>I</HI> thought was coming on me, and <HI>I</HI> did not know how &s;oon. My Thoughts were much di&s;turbed: <HI>I</HI> then prayed as well as read; but <HI>I</HI> knew not what I &s;aid, <HI>I</HI> was &s;o
<PB N="6" REF="002782_0006_0FE63374E79262E8">
confu&s;ed. The&s;e Terrors I thought did me more Hurt than Good; and <HI>I</HI> &s;trived, what <HI>I</HI> could, to get them out of my Mind; &s;o that, after a while, <HI>I</HI> was more ea&s;y, yet not unconcerned, be&s;ure,&mdash;and the more concerned becau&s;e I thought, being a poor <HI>Indian</HI> and in a &s;trange Place, e&s;pecially in a Time of War; People would be little con|cerned about me. However, <HI>I</HI> thought there was a Mini&s;ter in the Town, and if he were a good Man he would have Compa&s;&s;ion on my Soul: <HI>I</HI> &s;ent for him; he told me, a|mong other Things, That <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t aggravate and not extenuate my Sin: I thought if I did &s;o, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould run di&s;tracted: But after the Confu&s;ion was a little off my Mind, I could read and pray more calmly; and I found many Places of Scripture that encou|raged me to be &s;eeking: However, <HI>I</HI> found my Heart continued &s;o hard, that <HI>I</HI> could not repent. When <HI>I</HI> fir&s;t went to Meeting, which was within a Sabbath or two after my fir&s;t Confinement, I was mightily affect|ed and my Heart &s;eemed to relent: <HI>I</HI> tho't <HI>I</HI> got a great deal of Good: This continued every Sabbath, for more than two Months, Afterwards my Heart &s;eemed hard and &s;en&s;e|le&s;s; but not always alike; &s;ometimes it
<PB N="7" REF="002782_0006_0FE63374E79262E8">
&s;eemed as if I got &s;ome Good, and &s;ome|times none. However, I was very diligent, reading and praying, not without great Af|fection at Times,&mdash;till the la&s;t of <HI>February;</HI> from which Time I had a Fellow Pri&s;oner for many Weeks together; which was a great Hindrance to me: He was continually, while&s;t awake, either &s;inging or full of vain or profane Talk. I then left off Prayer, which <HI>I</HI> had con&s;tantly practiced four or five Months before; and commonly &s;even or eight Times in a Day. At la&s;t, I had no De&s;ire to pray, and neglected going to Meet|ing; though &s;till I read more or le&s;s, every Day, the whole Time of my Confinement; and for the mo&s;t part &s;everal Hours in a Day. When I had again the Advantage of being alone, I thought I mu&s;t betake my &s;elf to Prayer, as before, but found my &s;elf much at a Lo&s;s: it &s;eemed dreadful to come before God again, after I had, for &s;o long a Time, left off Prayer! I went to Meeting, but found my Heart harder, than at the wor&s;t, before; I could not think that I got any man|ner of Good, for the mo&s;t part: Sometimes I &s;hould &s;eem a little affected, but nothing as at fir&s;t. I &s;hould &s;ometimes have hard Thoughts why &s;hould God leave me to be
<PB N="8" REF="002782_0007_0FE63374EAF58348">
guilty of Murder,&mdash;but then I thought, he left <HI>David</HI> to fall into the &s;ame Sin.</P>
<P>After I was condemned, I was more con|cerned: I have continued, ever &s;ince, &s;eek|ing to God and waiting on him in the U&s;e of all Means, publick and private. I find my Heart is very bad: I have no Good in me. Some Time ago, I was thinking, though I had no true Love to Chri&s;t, yet I did not hate him: but, on Examination, I di&s;co|vered plainly that I had Hatred in my Heart again&s;t Chri&s;t; which was very terrifying to me. I am thoroughly convinced, now, though I thought otherwi&s;e at fir&s;t, that I am &s;o far from having any Power to change my Heart, that I have no Will to any thing that is Good; nor can I rai&s;e up one good De&s;ire in my Heart. I am very &s;tupid and unaffected! I have been &s;ometimes almo&s;t ready to de&s;pair: but I have &s;till &s;ome Hope that God may be gracious to me: I am re&s;olved by his Grace to &s;eek to the la&s;t; and if I peri&s;h, after all, I think I am tho|roughly convinced that God is righteous; for he owes me nothing. All the Encourage|ment I have is from the Death and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which is &s;ufficient to &s;ave me; and from the powerful Grace
<PB N="9" REF="002782_0007_0FE63374EAF58348">
of God which can change my Heart in a Moment,</P>
<P>Thus having quitted his vain Confidence, and conceived an humble, evangelical Hope in the Mercy of God, the Merits of Chri&s;t and the al-conquering Power of the Spirit of Grace; his Hope &s;en&s;ibly to him&s;elf, and apparently to others, increa&s;ed more and more to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>He had been, at Times, on the very brink of De&s;pair, and &s;poken de&s;perate Words: He would &s;ometimes &s;peak with an Air of Di&s;dain, That &s;uch a Sinner as <HI>he</HI> &s;hould be &s;aved! And as tho' 'twere unrea&s;onable that he &s;hould cheri&s;h the lea&s;t Hope of it. Yet was he con&s;trained to hope in the Divine Al|&s;ufficiency; having a very di&s;tinct Under|&s;tanding of the way of Salvation, by learning the Catechi&s;m in his Childhood and early Youth; by his con&s;tant Attendance on the Mini&s;try for many Years together; by his natural Love to Reading, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, and by his great Diligence therein while&s;t a Pri&s;oner; together with per&s;onal In&s;truc|tions by a good number of Vi&s;itants; who al&s;o furni&s;hed him with Variety of the mo&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="002782_0008_0FE633805110AED0">
&s;uitable Books, le&s;&s;er and larger; all or mo&s;t of which he deliberately read over; and &s;ome of them not once only nor twice; <HI>Fox</HI> of Time and the End of Time, and Mr. <HI>Stoddard'</HI>s Guide to Chri&s;t; with <HI>Char nock</HI> of Man's Enmity again&s;t God; and God's Mercy to the wor&s;t of Men. were peculiar|ly ble&s;&s;ed to him for his Awakening, Con|viction, Humiliation, Direction and Incou|ragement.&mdash;Examples al&s;o, peculiarly that of <HI>E&s;ther Rogers,</HI> her &s;ignally marvel|lous Conver&s;ion and triumphant Death, after repeated Murthers dreadfully aggravated, were of &s;pecial U&s;e to him. While&s;t Thou|&s;ands of Prayers were going up for him, in hundreds of Families and many &s;cores of Congregations: For there was (in the &s;even Weeks which his merciful Judges allowed him after his Sentence) Opportunity, at the condemned Man's de&s;ire, by Word or Writ|ing to be&s;peak a publick Remembrance for him of more than an hundred Mini&s;ters of four Provinces and Colonies. And there &s;eemed to be much of the Spirit of Prayer in a good number, moving them to &s;trive together and apart for his Conver&s;ion: And the poor Soul had a &s;ort of unaccountable, but unconquerable Expectation that the Lord
<PB N="11" REF="002782_0008_0FE633805110AED0">
might convert him at la&s;t; and was for the mo&s;t part, fixed in his re&s;olved Purpo&s;e to be &s;eeking and waiting to the la&s;t Day, Hour, and Minute of his Time: But yet very &s;en|&s;ible, that unle&s;s the Lord gave him an Heart thus to &s;eek and wait, he could do nei|ther, as the following Di&s;cour&s;e had betwixt the Pri&s;oner and one that vi&s;ited him, about ten Days before his Execution, may &s;erve to &s;hew; as al&s;o to confirm what was be|fore declared, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That though for the mo&s;t part he was a Pri&s;oner of Hope (and <HI>Zech.</HI> 9. 11, 12. was one Prop to his Hope) yet was he &s;ometimes almo&s;t ready to De&s;pair.</P>

<P>&mdash;Then the Pri&s;oner took his Bible, that he had from the beginning of his Im|pri&s;onment read much in, and wherein he had &s;cores of Leaves turned down. He o|pened it and &s;hewed the Woman that was now talking with him, &s;everal places in the Prophets, and in the P&s;alms, &amp;c. that he had been trying to take Incouragement from. One of them was, P&s;al. 119. 18, 19. <HI>Open thou mine Eyes, that I may &s;ee the wondrous things out of thy Law. I am a &s;tranger in the Earth, hide not thy Commandments from me.</HI></P>
<P>This Talk was before he gave his Relati|on, although that was fir&s;t in&s;erted, becau&s;e it begins with his Birth and Education, His Talk had been much in this &s;train to o|thers that had vi&s;ited him. Some few Days before his Death, One that had him&s;elf been much exerci&s;ed with Athei&s;tical Thoughts,
<PB N="15" REF="002782_0010_0FE63381597570D8">
asked the Pri&s;oner, Whether he believed that there is a God? He an&s;wered. Yes, but I don't know him, have no Acquaintance with him, am an utter Stranger to him. The &s;ame Per&s;on asked him at another Time, Whether he repented. He &s;aid he could not repent. You <HI>will</HI> not repent &s;aid the good Man. He con&s;ented and owned that he had no Will to repent.</P>
<P>He was asked by another, How he knew that he was in an unconverted E&s;tate: His An&s;wer was, That he had no Faith in Chri&s;t. Query, How do you know that? An&s;w. Be|cau&s;e <HI>Faith works by Love,</HI> and I have no Love to that which is good. Q. What do you think would convert you? A. Be&s;ure not all the means in the World: It mu&s;t be God alone. Q. But what will God do, or what mu&s;t be done by him in order to your Conver&s;ion? A. I never had the glo|riou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t di&s;covered to me, yet: If ever I be converted I &s;hall have Chri&s;t revealed to my Soul, and that will convert me at once.</P>

to, &s;ays he, &s;uch an one (naming one of his own Nation) came to me t'other Day, and de&s;ired me to give him Warning, I did warn him from my Example to beware of the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s.

So that (&s;ays <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>) when I am hanged, and if twenty more &s;hould, by their Drun|kenne&s;s, bring them&s;elves to the &s;ame wo|ful End, yet the re&s;t will not take Warning. He was asked what Advantage, then it would have been to him, might he have been acquitted and &s;et at Liberty on his Trial, or to have a Pardon, if that were at|tainable. He acknowledged 'twould mo&s;t probably, have been his Ruine, yea, he ex|pre&s;s'd his Fears le&s;t, after all, Iniquity would be his Ruine. But &s;aid, he had much more Hope of being brought to Repentance by his Confinement and certain Expectation of Death, than he could otherwi&s;e have. Nay, he &s;pake as if he could have no Hope at all that he &s;hould have any Heart to im|prove his Liberty unto a Reformation of his former Life, though his Life might be given him on that Condition. And therefore
<PB N="17" REF="002782_0011_0FE633815CCA7BC0">
would often be ready to &s;ay, in An&s;wer to Que&s;tionings and Expo&s;tulations about the&s;e things,&mdash;That it was better for him to die, than to live. The Death of the Body, &s;aid he, is nothing, were it not for the &s;e|cond Death.</P>
<P>He was, both before, and after his Con|demnation, full of his Complaints about his Darkne&s;s, Deadne&s;s and hardne&s;s of Heart: He would &s;ay he had an Heart like a Devil; and was free to acknowledge that having hardened his own Heart, by neglecting the means of Grace for &s;o many Years together, after his Time was out with his Ma&s;ter, and going on wilfully in Sin, particularly the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, for more than &s;even Years together. God might ju&s;tly, now, give him up to blindne&s;s of Mind; and hardne&s;s of Heart, to his eternal Ruine. And thus by a full Di&s;covery of his utter Inability to help him&s;elf, and extream Un|worthine&s;s to obtain help from the LORD, he was brought by a mighty work of the Spirit, di&s;covering al&s;o to him the Sove|reign Right of Dominion God had over him, as to Body and Soul, for Time and E|ternity, he was con&s;trained to &s;urrender him|&s;elf up into the LORD's Hands, to be di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="18" REF="002782_0012_0FE6338BDF3044A8">
of according to his Will and Plea|&s;ure: Ju&s;tifying God however he &s;hould plea&s;e to deal with him.</P>
<P>He had ju&s;tifyed God and Man in the Ver|dict and Sentence: had acknowledged and admired the Mercy, as well as Equity of his Judges, in the fair Trial he had. He &s;aid to one of the Mini&s;ters, that if one of the Judges, him&s;elf, &s;hould have been Tried for his Life, he could not have had a fairer Trial. And how expre&s;s and ready was he in his An&s;wer to the u&s;ual Que&s;tion before the pronouncing of Sentence, Have you any thing to &s;ay why Sentence of Death &s;hould not be pronounced upon you, <HI>I have nothing again&s;t it,</HI> were the Words of his An&s;wer, and he continued to acquie&s;ce in the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of his Sentence, even to the la&s;t. To One that talked with him, upon this Head, he &s;aid, I prayed ju&s;t before my Tri|al came on, that Ju&s;tice might take place; and I am &s;atisfied that <HI>I am Guilty, and have Ju&s;tice done.</HI></P>
<P>And now, as was &s;aid, he was brought to ju&s;tify God, though He &s;hould Sentence him to &s;uffer the Pains of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Death. And to a good Woman that vi&s;ited him &s;ome con&s;iderable Time before his Execution, he
<PB N="19" REF="002782_0012_0FE6338BDF3044A8">
expre&s;t it as his Wi&s;h, that he might never have hard Thoughts of God, though he &s;hould throw him into Hell.</P>
<P>He had, in the mean time, as hath been once and again before ob&s;erved, a &s;ecret Hope rooted in him (though the actings of it, in Times of extraordinary Temptation, were &s;u&s;pended) that there might be Mercy in Re&s;erve for him at la&s;t, and Forgivene&s;s with God, &s;o that his Purpo&s;e of Seeking and Waiting to the End, was never quite broken off. That Word in 1 Pet. 1. 13. was a &s;ingu|lar Support to him, <HI>Wherefore gird up the loyns of your Mind; be &s;ober and hope to the End, for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> There was no Text of Scripture that did more &s;en|&s;ibly relieve him, the la&s;t Week of his Time, than this: He would be &s;peaking of it, over and over; &s;o that one of the Mini&s;ters, that in the ab&s;ence of the Mini&s;ter belong|ing to the Place, was mo&s;t conver&s;ant with him, prepared a Di&s;cour&s;e upon it; and not having Opportunity before the Pri&s;oners Death to preach it in publick, he read or preached it to him, privately in the Pri&s;on, for his further Incouragement.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002782_0013_0FE6338BE287DFD0">
When his la&s;t Sabbath came, his Spirit, through the Violence of Temptation (the Adver&s;ary having but a &s;hort Time) &s;eem|ed to be under very extraordinary Agitations: One thing that di&s;covered it, was an Expre&s;|&s;ion of this Import, that dropt from him; If I have not Comfort or Relief this Sabbath, I fear I &s;hall be utterly di&s;couraged. The Subject of the publick Di&s;cour&s;es, that Day, was <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 55. 6. <HI>Seek ye the Lord while be may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked for &s;ake his way and the unrighteous Man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, for he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundant|ly pardon. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> But it plea&s;ed &s;overeign Grace to maintain his Hope, and renew his Incouragement, to wait unto the End.</P>
<P>Aftet this, a very remarkable Alteration was ob&s;erved in him; he was carried above the amazing Fear of Death. He expre&s;&s;ed much more of a Spirit of Thankfulne&s;s for what was done for the promoting of his Con|ver&s;ion and Preparation for what was, now, ju&s;t before him. Repeated and reiterated
<PB N="21" REF="002782_0013_0FE6338BE287DFD0">
Prayers were made with him, as well as for him, and he &s;eemed much more affected, and even melted. He had clearer Di&s;coveries of the Fulne&s;s and &s;uitablene&s;s of Chri&s;t; ex|pre&s;&s;ing his humble De&s;ires of believing on him. As for any thing in him, or done by him, in the lea&s;t, to recommend him to the Divine Acceptance,&mdash;he utterly di&s;|claimed any &s;uch thing. The Knowledge he had acquired (though marvellous to o|thers,) the Duties he had performed, the Pains he had taken, the Ab&s;tinence he had exerci&s;ed, &amp;c. was all nothing, and le&s;s than nothing, in his own Account, yea wor&s;e than nothing, in point of Ju&s;tification. He could look back and remember with Grief and Shame, how much he had, aforetime, and after his Confinement, been under the power of a &s;elf-righteous Spirit. Particu|larly, he ob&s;erved, how that when one told him, as at his fir&s;t coming into Pri&s;on, that he had eight or nine Months time to re|pent in. His &s;ecret thoughts were that he &s;hould accompli&s;h the Work in a quarter of that time: But now he expre&s;&s;ed, to a cer|tain Vi&s;itant, his Wonder that any gracele&s;s Soul &s;hould hope to do any thing, before Conver&s;ion, that might, in the lea&s;t, recom|mend

&s;uch an one to the Favour of God: So that (we tru&s;t) he was thoroughly hum|bled out of him&s;elf, and brought unre&s;erved|ly to ju&s;tify God, and &s;ubmit unto his un|controulable and righteous &s;overeign Do|minion, which preparatory Work, as Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> ob&s;erves, if it be clear, the Souls clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t is unque&s;tionable. In|deed, It is not known that he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as having a &s;en&s;e of the Love of Chri&s;t to any, but one gracious Woman; who was very inqui&s;itive into his Experien|ces; &amp; among other things &s;he asked him whe|ther he had not found, at &s;ome times, a &s;en|&s;ible Love to Chri&s;t: He &s;aid he had; but, &s;aid he, I found by reading one of the little Books I have by me, I was mi&s;taken; and reached the Book and &s;hewed her the Place that had, as he called it, &s;hewn him how he was mi&s;taken; and that his Love to Chri&s;t was not &s;uch as true Believers or converted Per&s;ons have. The good Woman can't remember the Title of the Book, nor di&s;tinctly relate what &s;he read or heard him read out of it; but only a Pa&s;&s;age to this Purpo&s;e, There's no Grace of the Spirit, or true Grace, which we would have, or think we have,&mdash;but the fal&s;e Spirit can fit

He &s;pake of it, with great Concern, that the Devil &s;hould have &s;uch Power in counter|feiting, &amp;c. ten Times expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing Fear that his Faith and Love and all was but counterfeit Grace. To another good Woman, that vi&s;ited him, the Night before his Death, he expre&s;&s;ed great Con|cern, and &s;ome Fear. Here I am to Night, &s;aid he, but where &s;hall I be to morrow Night: Yet being asked whether he was willing to die, he readily an&s;wered that he was; and &s;aid he had rather die than live; and mentioned again that of <HI>Peter,</HI> 1 Epi&s;tle 1 Chap. 13. Ver.&mdash;<HI>Hope to the End, for the Grace that is to be brought unto you,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the la&s;t Morning of his Life, his Faith and Hope was found to continue, &amp; &s;till to be in|crea&s;ing more and more. The Mini&s;ter that preached the Lecture, prayed with him in the Pri&s;on,&mdash;God was wonderfully pre&s;ent, the Pri&s;oner much affected and melted.</P>
<P>The Text from which he heard a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable Di&s;cour&s;e, and therein heard his la&s;t, was <HI>Luke</HI> 23. 42, 43. <HI>And be &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom. And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him,

Verily, I &s;ay unto thee, To day &s;halt thou be with me Paradi&s;e.</HI> After the Lecture poor <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was asked which of the Mini&s;ters he de|&s;ired might, pray at the Place of Execution: He readily &s;ignified his De&s;ire, that the Mini&s;ter that preached (and had prayed with him in the Morning) might pray with and for him at his Death.</P>
<P>At the Time appointed for the Man of Death to take his la&s;t &s;teps, mo&s;t of the Mini&s;ters of the County, and &s;everal others, accompanied him on his way,&mdash;The Mile's Walk was improved in directing, in|couraging &amp; cautioning the Pri&s;oner of Hope; who, again &amp; again expre&s;&s;ed his Hope, but very mode&s;tly: As for In&s;tance; He was ask|ed, Do you believe that the Lord is <HI>willing</HI> as well as <HI>able</HI> to &s;ave you? He an&s;wered, Yes, I de&s;ire to believe. On the fir&s;t &s;ight of the Sea, on the &s;hore of which was the Place of Execution, He was asked, whether he could venture upon the Ocean of Eternity in the Ark Chri&s;t? He &s;aid, Yes. He was told, that was Faith: He returned, I am not &s;ure I have Faith, whereas he had all along, 'till a little before this Day, confidently denied that he had any &s;aving Faith. At fir&s;t &s;ight of the Gallows, he was asked, whether the Sight

were not not terrifying to him? He an&s;wer|ed, No; not at all. And indeed, his Coun|tenance, his Words; for Matter &amp; Manner; and his whole Behaviour in the Way to and at the Place of Execution, &s;hewed plain eno' that he was very much above the Prevalen|cy of any &s;uch thing as &s;lavi&s;h Fear.</P>
<P>The Gallows was fixed in a Valley, with Hills on the one &s;ide, and on the other, &s;o that the numerous Spectators (they were by Conjecture about three Thou&s;and: there having been no &s;uch Example in the Coun|ty for more than &s;eventy Years) had an ad|vantageous Pro&s;pect. After one of the Mi|ni&s;ters had prayed, &amp;c. the humble Penitent chearfully a&s;cended the Ladder, and gave Warning to the People, in the following Words, <HI>I would have you all take Warning by me, I am come here to die a &s;hameful Death; and I acknowledge the Ju&s;tice of God in it, 'tis Drunkenne&s;s that has brought me to it. I would have you all to leave off your Drunkenne&s;s; for if you don't leave it off, it will certainly bring you to &s;ome dreadful End.</HI> Then he prayed &s;o freely, &s;o di&s;tinctly, &amp; &s;o pertinently, that it was to the Admiration of the Wi&s;e&s;t and Be&s;t; the mo&s;t impartial and judicious that heard him: But for want of the &s;ea&s;onable

Penning it down, the Reader can't have &s;o full &amp; exact an Account of the Prayer, as of the &s;horter Warning.</P>
<P>In his Prayer he addre&s;&s;ed God as mo&s;t ho|ly &amp; glorious; He acknowledged that him|&s;elf was a great Sinner, &amp; that his Sins were attended with very extraordinary Aggravati|ons, for he confe&s;&s;ed that he had &s;inned a|gain&s;t great Light &amp; Knowledge, that he had &s;inned away ble&s;&s;ed &s;ea&s;ons of Grace; in cry|ing to God for Mercy notwith&s;tanding his ma|ny &amp; great Sins, he pleaded the di&s;covery God had made of his merciful Nature, That he delighted not in the Death of a Sinner, &amp;c. He pleaded the Merit and Virtue of the Blood of Chri&s;t (which he called the Blood of Sprinkling) as &s;ufficient to clean&s;e from all Sin, how heinous &s;oever! begging Par|don and Clean&s;ing, alone, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. He acknowledged his Inability to do any thing, and unworthine&s;s to receive any thing. Begging that God would make him &s;uch as He would have him to be; &amp; that he might be &s;prinkled with the Blood of Chri&s;t. And expre&s;ly committing his Spirit into the Hands of his Saviour, he concluded with a proper Doxology: and having once more,

<P>It was ob&s;erved that the great A&s;&s;embly of Spectators, were generally much affected, perhaps almo&s;t beyond Example.</P>
<P>Several Things in the All-di&s;po&s;ing, very my&s;terious and &s;uper-abundantly gracious Providence of God our Saviour, relating to the Subject of the preceding Account, &s;eem worthy of Ob&s;ervation and &s;pecial Remark.</P>
