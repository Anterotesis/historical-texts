<P>THE Jewi&s;h captivity in Babylon, and their return from it, is frequently mentioned in the &s;acred writings: the prophets who lived before this memorable event, had a &s;ingle eye to it in their prophe&s;ies, fore-telling it as the ju&s;t and righteous puni&s;hment of Jeru&s;alem's idolatry, vile ingratitude, &amp; incorrigible wicked|ne&s;s. But the three la&s;t of the prophets lived and prophe&s;ied, after the return from Babyloni&s;h captivity. <Q>Haggai, and Zachariah, appeared much about the &s;ame time: and it was &s;ome time after the return from captivity, when the building of the temple was both retarded by <HI>its enemies,</HI> and neglected by its friends.</Q> Then the prophets, Haggai the
<PB N="4" REF="012464_0003_0F89C9D70C688380">
prophet, and Zachariah the &s;on of Iddo, prophe|&s;ied unto the Jews that were in Jeru&s;alem, in the <HI>name of the God of I&s;rael:</HI> to reprove them for their coldne&s;s and indifferency, re&s;pecting the wor&s;hip of God, and for their carele&s;ne&s;s, and remi&s;ne&s;s, in letting the hou&s;e of God lie wa&s;te: and to encourage, and animate, and quicken them to revive the good work of build|ing the temple, which had now been neglected for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, and to go on with it with vigour and re&s;olution, notwith&s;tanding any oppo&s;ition, they had or &s;hould meet with in this noble and important undertaking. And among other things that the prophet Haggai mentions, by God's direction, to encourage and animate the people to go on, with the laudable work of building the &s;econd temple, this is one mention|ed in the text, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>that the glory of this latter hou&s;e &s;hould be greater than of the former.</Q> The hou&s;e here referred to, is the &s;econd temple at Jeru&s;alem, who&s;e glory &s;hould excel that of the fir&s;t temple. The fir&s;t temple was built by king Solomon, by the expre&s;s direction of God him&s;elf, for the honour of his adorable name, for his wor&s;hip and &s;ervice, near five hundred years before this &s;econd: and it was, no doubt, the mo&s;t curious &s;tructure, the mo&s;t magnificent, rich and co&s;tly building, the &s;un had ever &s;hined upon. Which temple, after it was compleated, was by king Solomon piou&s;ly dedicated to God, for &s;acred u&s;e, in religious wor&s;hip and &s;ervice, an account of which &s;olemn dedication, is re|corded
<PB N="5" REF="012464_0004_0F89C9D85A299220">
in the fir&s;t book of Kings, chapter viii, which temple, for the &s;ins of the people, the prevalence of their idolatry, their notorious in|gratitude and awful rebellion again&s;t God, was ruined by fire. Jeru&s;alem was de&s;troyed, the walls broken down, and the temple burnt, by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, about four hundred years after it was built, and Zedekiah their wicked king, with his chiefs, and &s;ubjects in general, were carried captives to Babylon,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the account 2 Kings, xxv chapter.</NOTE> where they were en&s;laved and cruelly treated, and, where tho&s;e that hated them, bare rule over them. Now after they had endured the mi&s;eries of captivity, for the &s;pace of &s;eventy years for their &s;ins, God who is merciful and invariably true to his word, remembered his covenant, and rai&s;ed Cyrus to the throne, according to his word; who, as &s;oon as he was ma&s;ter of the kingdom of Babylon, relea&s;es all God's vi&s;ible people from captivity, i&s;&s;ues a royal and gracious proclamation, granting them full liberty to re|turn to their own land, with orders and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to build the hou&s;e of God in Jeru&s;alem. See Ezra fir&s;t chapter. At this proclamation mul|titudes of the captivated Jews return to their own land, who &s;oon engaged in the laudable work of building the hou&s;e of God. But alas! their hearts &s;oon grew faint, through the oppo|&s;ition they met with, which was &s;trong, and the work cea&s;ed for &s;ome time, through the crafty oppo&s;ition of their enemies, and through the
<PB N="6" REF="012464_0005_0F89C9D905A8CE88">
coldne&s;s of &s;ome, and through the cowardice and covetou&s;ne&s;s of others among the Jews. Hag|gai was the fir&s;t prophet, that appeared in the name of the Lord of ho&s;ts, to arou&s;e this people to a &s;en&s;e of their duty, to reprove them for their remi&s;ne&s;s and ingratitude, in letting the hou&s;e of God lie wa&s;te, and to exhort and en|courage Zerubbabel the governor, and Jo&s;hua the high-prie&s;t, and the re&s;t of the people, to re|&s;tore the wor&s;hip, and rebuild the temple of God, which had been long neglected. Now God in zeal for his own glory, and in mercy to his people, &s;ent his &s;ervant Haggai to awaken and quicken them to their duty, i. e. to build the temple and re&s;tore the pure wor&s;hip of God. The neglect of which was their &s;in and their &s;hame, and the procuring cau&s;e of the&s;e calami|ties which they laboured under: they &s;owed much but gathered but little, they eat, but had not enough, they drank, but were not filled, they cloathed them&s;elves, but were not warm. The rea&s;on of this is a&s;&s;igned, 'tis becau&s;e the hou&s;e of God lay wa&s;te. But the in&s;pired pro|phet does implicitly let them know, that upon their going about this work, God would pro&s;per them and ble&s;s them with great plenty. The people hearken to this moving me&s;&s;age, and &s;oon go to work on the Lord's hou&s;e, and they are abundantly &s;ucceeded in their labour. After the foundation of the &s;econd temple was laid, and the hou&s;e began to appear in view, &s;ome of the younger people who had never &s;een the former

temple were joyful: but the old men who had &s;een the fir&s;t temple in its glory were &s;orrow|ful, and even wept. The extraordinary things with which the fir&s;t temple was honoured, and which were wanting in the &s;econd, no doubt was &s;ome cau&s;e of their grief, as well as that the &s;tructure was not &s;o magnificent and noble. The things wanting, were &s;uch as the&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the ark of the covenant, the mercy-&s;eat upon it, the &s;hecinah, the urim and thummim, and the holy fire upon the altar. And moreover, this latter temple was not &s;o large, &s;o &s;tately and magnifi|cent, as that which Solomon built. And the antient men who were grieved, could remember the fir&s;t temple, and the glory and &s;plendor there|of, and were &s;en&s;ible of the great di&s;parity be|tween this and that. They could remember the gold with which it was adorn'd and beauti|fied, the &s;tones with which it was embelli&s;hed and decorated, and the magnificence of the porch and of the pillars. But though this hou&s;e would not be &s;o magnificent as the former, nor any ways equal it in vi&s;ible &s;plendor &amp; grandeur, yet God by the mouth of his prophet, encourages the people to go on cheerfully in the building of it&mdash;&amp; lets them know that the real glory of the latter hou&s;e, &s;hould be greater than that of the former. He gives them to under&s;tand that they need not be &s;olicitou&s;ly concerned, that this hou&s;e had not &s;o much &s;ilver and gold about it as So|lomon's temple had, for &s;ays the great Lord of the univer&s;e, <Q>the gold is mine and the &s;ilver is

mine,</Q> context ver&s;e 8th. He comforts them with this, that although the outward ornaments of this hou&s;e would not equal tho&s;e of the for|mer, yet &s;till its real glory &s;hould be greater. "The glory of this latter hou&s;e &s;hall be greater than the former." This was not &s;o in re&s;pect of outward glory, magnificence and &s;plendor. This latter hou&s;e was indeed beautiful, and we find one of the di&s;ciples of our Lord admiring the &s;tones, and building of the temple, Mark xiii, 1. But it was nothing in compari&s;on with the tem|ple which king Solomon built, for vi&s;ible &s;plen|dor, magnificence and ornaments. It what then did the glory of this latter temple excel that of the former? What made its glory greater?&mdash;Why it was the per&s;onal pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t there, in the days of his humanity. Into this temple, the &s;on of God when he became incarnate, was ear|ly brought and pre&s;ented to the Lord&mdash;here he attended at twelve years old, here he at that age, attentively heard the doctors, and a&s;ked them the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important que&s;ti|ons, in&s;omuch that all who heard him were a|&s;toni&s;hed at his under&s;tanding and an&s;wers. See Luke, ii chapter. Here al&s;o afterwards, he preached the glorious go&s;pel, &amp; here he wrought miracles, which were a confirmation of his mi&s;|&s;ion from the Father. In the latter temple, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t made his per&s;onal appear|ance in the days of his humanity. In the tem|ple Je&s;us Chri&s;t was daily preached, and it was this made its glory greater than that of the for|mer.
<PB N="9" REF="012464_0008_0F89C9DCEBEECBB0">
God by his prophet, encourages the peo|ple to go on in the building of the temple, for &s;ays the high and holy <HI>One</HI> who inhabits the prai|&s;es of I&s;rael, I will &s;hake the heavens and the earth, and the de&s;ire of all nations &s;hall come: &amp; I will fill <HI>this</HI> hou&s;e with glory. This is a plain prediction of the coming of Chri&s;t, who in the fulne&s;s of time, per&s;onally appeared in the hou&s;e, and in reference to this, we are to under&s;tand the text. In which &s;en&s;e 'tis really true, the glory of the &s;econd temple was greater than the glory of the fir&s;t. The former excelled in out|ward glory and magnificence, but Chri&s;t him|&s;elf was the glory of the latter. There the Son of God the Saviour of the world, was early pre&s;ented, there he was acknowledged as God's anointed, as the light of the Gentiles, as the glory of I&s;rael, by good old Simeon, who took him in his arms, and ble&s;&s;ed God that his eyes had &s;een his &s;alvation, and was then ready to depart in peace. Where Chri&s;t is, there is glory indeed. His pre&s;ence renders a hou&s;e of wor&s;hip more glorious, than any outward orna|ments and adornings whatever. From the text thus explained, we may rai&s;e this general</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION. To enjoy the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e of wor|&s;hip, is truly its greate&s;t glory, and this is what a people ought mo&s;t earne&s;tly to de&s;ire and &s;eek after.</HEAD>
<P>In illu&s;trating this general ob&s;ervation, I &s;hall pur&s;ue the following method, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<P>IV. That the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, is truly its greate&s;t glory.</P>
<P>I. My bu&s;ine&s;s, according to the method pro|po&s;ed, is to &s;hew when a people may be &s;aid, to have the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with them, in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>We are not now to expect the per&s;onal pre|&s;ence of the Son of God, in our wor&s;hipping a&s;|&s;emblies, as it was enjoyed in the days of his incarnation, and while he abode here on earth. It is his &s;piritual pre&s;ence only, that we are to expect to enjoy: this is what we are to &s;eek and pray for, as what is mo&s;t de&s;irable. And there is no doubt at all, but that Chri&s;t is fre|quently pre&s;ent in his wor&s;hiping a&s;&s;emblies here on earth, by the kind influences and teachings of his &s;pirit, making the in&s;titutions of his wor|&s;hip, means of awakening &s;inners, of edifying the children of God, and thus owning and ble&s;|&s;ing his people. And in general, a people may be &s;aid to have the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with them, in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, when he owns the pub|lic ordinances, and makes them means of &s;pi|ritual good, to precious and immortal &s;ouls. But to be particular.</P>

1. When a people have a &s;pirit of prayer and &s;upplication, in Chri&s;t's hou&s;e of prayer, then they may be &s;aid to enjoy his pre&s;ence. A real &s;pirit of prayer, is from the great author and fi|ni&s;her of faith, when a people have a right &s;en&s;e of their dependance upon God, for all mercies, &s;piritual and temporal, and come to God in prayer, believing that he is the rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him, when they approach to God, &s;en&s;ible of their own nothingne&s;s, and place their dependance, on the merits and in|terce&s;&s;ion of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for audience with the Father, and make mention of his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and his only, when they &s;incerely la|ment their &s;ins before God, judging and con|demning them&s;elves, as guilty, unworthy crea|tures, who have &s;inned again&s;t God, and have forfeited all title to his favour, when they &s;in|cerely implore the pardon, and forgivene&s;s of their &s;ins, for the great Mediator's &s;ake, when they offer up their &s;incere de&s;ires to God, in the name of Chri&s;t, they may be &s;aid to have the &s;pi|rit of prayer, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;piritu|ally pre&s;ent with them, pre&s;ent with them by his &s;pirit, who is then helping their infirmities, with groans which cannot <HI>be uttered,</HI> as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it. Rom. viii, 26. Likewi&s;e the &s;pirit al&s;o, helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought, but the &s;pirit it&s;elf, maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered. 'Tis not &s;o much the florid expre&s;&s;ions, 'tis not &s;o much
<PB N="12" REF="012464_0011_0F89C9E1AC079B40">
the rhetorick and eloquence of our prayers, as the faith, &s;incerity and fervency of them, that the &s;pirit as interce&s;&s;or and helper works in us. 'Tis likewi&s;e &s;aid, Zach. xii, 10. <Q>And I will pour upon the hou&s;e of David and upon the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, the &s;pirit of grace, and of &s;upplication, and they &s;hall look upon me, whom they have pierced, and they &s;hall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only &s;on, and &s;hall be in biterne&s;s for him, as one that is in bitterne&s;s, for his fir&s;t born.</Q> Thus when Chri&s;t pours out a &s;pirit of prayer and of &s;upplication upon a people, it may be &s;aid, he is &s;piritually pre&s;ent with them, he is then with them by his &s;pirit, and all the teachings, and all the influences of the divine &s;pirit, come to us, as the fruits of the Redeemers purcha&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;piritually pre|&s;ent with his people in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, when a preached go&s;pel is there made truly pro|fitable to the &s;ouls of men; when 'tis made a means of convincing and converting &s;inners. The preaching of the go&s;pel is a mean of grace, which Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted, for the &s;piritual good and benefit of precious and immortal &s;ouls. Mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us, are his amba&s;|&s;adors, &s;ent forth in his name to per&s;uade, and be&s;eech them to be reconciled unto God. And the plain per&s;ua&s;ive preaching of the glorious go&s;pel, is a mean of grace, which the &s;pirit of God often makes u&s;e of, for the conviction of &s;inners, for the awakening of them, and of rou&s;|ing

them, out of their carnal ea&s;e and &s;ecuri|ty, a means of bringing them to &s;erious con&s;i|deration, and to inquire in earne&s;t, what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved: like Peter's hearers, who were pricked in their hearts, and &s;olicitou&s;ly in|quire what they &s;hall do. Acts ii, 37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and &s;aid unto Peter, and to the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, men and brethren, what &s;hall we do? So the preaching of the go&s;pel, is often made a means of the &s;inners conver&s;ion. 1 Cor. i, 21. For after that, in the wi&s;dom of God, the world|by wi&s;dom knew not God, it plea&s;ed God by the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching, to &s;ave them that be|lieve. But true it is, that preaching will never be to any &s;aving purpo&s;e, unle&s;s the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t accompanies it to the hearts of men, and makes it a mean of their &s;piritual good. Paul may plant, and Appollos water, but it is God that gives the increa&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>If mini&s;ters had the tongues of angels, they could not of them&s;elves prevail with &s;in|ners, to believe and obey the go&s;pel; 'tis the office of the &s;pirit, to awaken the con&s;cience, and|to di&s;po&s;e the &s;everal faculties of the &s;oul, to a chearful compliance, with their be&s;t in|tere&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>When a preached go&s;pel is &s;et home with power, upon the hearts of &s;inners, by the agency of the divine &s;pirit, and made a mean of their awakening, and of their &s;olicitou&s;ly inquiring what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved, when tis made a

mean of their effectual turning, from the love and practice of &s;in, to the love and practice of holine&s;s, in &s;hort, when men and women are new born in the hou&s;e of God, as we are told it &s;hould be &s;aid of Zion. P&s;alm lxxxvii, 5.&mdash;And of Zion it &s;hall be &s;aid, this and that man was born in her: when this is the ca&s;e, it may well be &s;aid, the people enjoy the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t there, for certain it is, without his graci|ous pre&s;ence, no &s;uch mighty effects will ever take place. So when the children of God are edified by means of a preached go&s;pel, when their graces are increa&s;ed, their love inflamed, their faith &s;trengthened, their zeal enlivened, and their principle of new obedience invigorat|ed, then they enjoy the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t. The&s;e &s;alutary effects, are owing to the &s;pirits power|fully impre&s;&s;ing go&s;pel truths upon their &s;ouls. And 'tis by means of the &s;incere milk of the word, that chri&s;tians often grow in grace, in purity and holine&s;s, it is hereby, that the &s;aints are of|ten edified and comforted. In the xcii P&s;alm towards the clo&s;e, is clearly &s;et forth, the great advantages ari&s;ing to the godly, from their de|vout and diligent attendance, upon the ordi|nances of public and &s;ocial wor&s;hip, in &s;uch lan|guage as this, <Q>The righteous &s;hall flouri&s;h like the palm tree: he &s;hall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Tho&s;e that be planted in the hou&s;e of the Lord, &s;hall flouri&s;h in the courts of our God. They &s;hall &s;till bring forth fruit in old age: they &s;hall be fat and flouri&s;hing.</Q></P>

3. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;piritually pre|&s;ent with his people in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, when his &s;pecial ordinances admini&s;tred there, are re|ally beneficial to the &s;ouls of men. It is the divine ble&s;&s;ing and teaching accompanying the&s;e, that renders them &s;avingly beneficial to immor|tal &s;ouls. Though bapti&s;m is to be admini&s;ter|ed but once, to one and the &s;ame per&s;on, yet when one who has been baptized him&s;elf, be|holds this ordinance admini&s;tered to others, it may be beneficial to him. And this it is, when it puts him in mind that he him&s;elf was once baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, whereby he was made a nominal chri&s;tian, initiated into the vi|&s;ible church, and laid under a mo&s;t &s;olemn obli|gation to be the Lord's di&s;ciple. It is benefici|al when it is a mean of awakening people, to a heart-affecting &s;en&s;e of their defilement, and corruption by nature, and of engaging them to apply to the purifying blood of Je&s;us, for par|don and for clean&s;ing. It is beneficial, when it is a mean of quickening them to cry earne&s;t|ly unto God, to pour out his &s;pirit upon them, to purge them from &s;in, and to clean&s;e and pu|rify them. It is beneficial, when it is a mean of engaging tho&s;e, who have had the Name of the Lord called upon them, afre&s;h to give up &s;elves to God the Father, as their God and fa|ther, to the Son of God as their divine Redeem|er, and almighty Saviour, and to the Holy Spi|rit as their divine teacher, leader and &s;anctifier.

And thus you &s;ee, we are not to be idle &s;pecta|tors, when we behold the ordinance of bapti&s;m admini&s;tered to others, we are to make a religi|ous improvement of it, we are to look to God to make it profitable to our own &s;ouls. And when it is made a mean of &s;piritual good to precious and immortal &s;ouls, when many are thus quick|ened, and benefited by it as we have heard, then the people may be &s;aid to enjoy the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t; when this ordinance publickly admini&s;|tered in the &s;anctuary, has, through the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, &s;uch &s;alutary effects as the&s;e upon the people, then the Son of God is &s;piritually pre&s;ent with them in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip. So when the Lord's &s;upper admini&s;tered in his hou&s;e, is a mean of promoting the &s;piritual good of tho&s;e that partake of it, then they may be &s;aid to enjoy the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with them in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip. This ordinance is to be kept up in the church of Chri&s;t, and will be until his &s;econd coming. The de&s;ign of this ordinance is to keep up in our &s;ouls, a lively, heart-affecting and &s;oul profiting remembrance of the dying love of Je&s;us. 'Tis de&s;igned to be a public te&s;timony, of our communion with the great head of the church. 1 Cor. 10, 16.

de&s;igned to excite our love and gratitude to Je&s;us, the Prince of Peace, who loved us, and gave his life a ran&s;om for us. 'Tis de&s;igned as an indication of our communion with fellow Saints, and of our love and charity towards them. 'Tis de&s;igned to increa&s;e our faith, to enkindle our repentance, and to quicken and animate us, to new and holy obedience. And when 'tis a mean of promoting the&s;e gracious purpo&s;es, then do his people enjoy the pre&s;ence of the glorious Redeemer with them. Yes, profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, when the Son of God meets you at his table, and there vouch&s;afes to admit you to communion with him, and when your &s;ouls are refre&s;hed, quicken'd and edified, at his table, and your grace enliven'd, it may well be &s;aid, you enjoy the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t. The &s;piri|tual pre&s;ence of the Son of God at his table, is all that we are to expect or &s;eek after: And we may not imagine, as the Papi&s;ts do, that the bread and wine after they are con&s;ecrated, are changed into the real body and blood of Chri&s;t. His pre&s;ence at his &s;upper, has re&s;pect to our faith. He is not pre|&s;ent to them that do not behold him by faith, but only to them who fiducially behold his &s;uf|fering, through the elements, and &s;uch, and &s;uch only, have communion with him. And thus Chri&s;t is &s;piritually pre&s;ent with his people at his table, when the holy ordinance is thus made beneficial to the &s;ouls of men. And thus we &s;ee what it is to enjoy the &s;piritual pre&s;ence of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in his hou&s;e of wor|&s;hip.</P>

<P>Indeed, they can do nothing to merit this ine&s;timable favour.

And,</P>
<P N="1">1. In order to enjoy the &s;piritual pre&s;ence of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e, the wor&s;hippers &s;hould &s;ee to it that they have love and charity for one another. If you come to the hou&s;e of God with your hearts full of allowed mali<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> envy and hatred towards any of your fellow wor&s;hip|pers, you have no rea&s;on to think you &s;hall en|joy the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t; &s;uch di&s;turbing pa&s;|&s;ions of the &s;oul, do mightily unfit for the &s;o|lemn &s;ervice of the &s;anctuary, and e&s;pecially that part of it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> public prayer, <HI>If you for|give not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es,</HI> how can you expect <HI>your heavenly father will forgive you your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es?</HI> Not that barely our forgiving our fellow men any injuries they have done to us, entitles us to the forgivene&s;s of the &s;ins we have commit|ted again&s;t God, but &s;uch is the con&s;titution of the go&s;pel, that while we are de&s;titute of a forgiving temper towards our fellow men, it leaves us no grounds to expect forgivene&s;s from God. No religious duty is acceptable to God
<PB N="19" REF="012464_0018_0F89C9E803DEB130">
without charity, God will not hear the prayers of tho&s;e who cultivate in their hearts hatred, envy, ill-will and malice towards their fellow|men. Mat. vi. 15. <HI>But if ye forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither</HI> will <HI>your father forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.

<P N="2">2. Would a people enjoy the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, they mu&s;t come up to wor&s;hip in his temple with right views &amp; aims, &amp; tho&s;e are, that they may truly glorify God, and receive &s;piritual peace and benefit to their own &s;ouls. God is infinitely the greate&s;t, and infinitely the be&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">gs and infinitely worthy of the highe&s;t prai&s;es of men and angels, it is therefore highly rea&s;onable, that our high|e&s;t aim &s;hould be his glory. Not that we worms of the du&s;t can add any thing to the e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="20" REF="012464_0019_0F89C9E8C2E47698">
glory of God, who is an all-perfect being, and the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day and forever. But by public wor&s;hip, we acknowledge his glorious excellencies, we hereby own his being, his per|fection, his glory and excellency, and do &s;ome|thing to &s;pread abroad, the glory and honour of his name&mdash;we hereby &s;ignify our belief, of our dependence upon God for all ble&s;&s;ings &s;piritual and temporal. We hereby own our obligati|ons to love and &s;erve, and obey the great and eternal God. And God is plea&s;ed to account him&s;elf honoured, by the &s;ocial wor&s;hip of his people in the temple, when 'tis performed in &s;pirit and truth. As the glory of God &s;hould be the chief view of our coming up to the hou&s;e of the Lord for &s;ocial wor&s;hip, &s;o our own &s;piritual good, may lawfully be our &s;ubordinate view. We &s;hould come up to the hou&s;e of the Lord with fervent de&s;ires, that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t would meet with us and ble&s;s us: that he would ble&s;s the provi&s;ion of his hou&s;e, to our &s;piritual good. God declared of old, that in all places where he &s;hould record his name, he would come unto them and ble&s;s them. The in&s;titutions of public wor&s;hip, are de&s;igned for the good of &s;ouls, and no doubt, thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands have found &s;aving benefit by them, and God is &s;till able to make them beneficial to &s;ouls, for his hand is not &s;hortned that it cannot &s;ave, nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear. So that we may rightly have a &s;ubordinate view, to our own &s;piritual good, by coming up to the hou&s;e of the Lord.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="21" REF="012464_0020_0F89C9E9C01C7528">
3. Would a people enjoy the &s;piritual pre|&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e, they mu&s;t &s;incerely implore and ardently plead for it. All &s;hould in &s;ecret on the Lord's day, previous to their going up to the hou&s;e of the Lord, ardently im|plore the gracious pre&s;ence of Je&s;us, that they and his wor&s;hiping a&s;&s;embly may be favoured with it that day. They &s;hould earne&s;tly pray that Chri&s;t would meet with them&punc; own and ble&s;s them. And his people in his hou&s;e of prayer, &s;hould unitedly implore his gracious pre&s;ence: the hou&s;e of God, where his people meet together for &s;olemn wor&s;hip, is called the hou&s;e of prayer. Mat. xxi, 13. This is the cour&s;e a people mu&s;t pur&s;ue, would they hopefully en|joy the glorious pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with them, in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, would they have him meet them there and own and ble&s;s them.</P>
<P>III. <HI>I would in a few words attempt to &s;hew, why a people ought mo&s;t earne&s;tly to de&s;ire the &s;piritu|al pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip. And the rea&s;ons I &s;hall offer are two.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Without the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e, he is not truly honored there. The Lord of glory is no further honoured, by our coming up to his hou&s;e for wor&s;hip, than his pre&s;ence is enjoyed there. We have heard what it is to enjoy the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in the &s;o|lemn a&s;&s;embly, and this is enjoyed, when he owns the public ordinances, and makes them means of good to precious &s;ouls. When &s;in|ners are convinced, when they are converted,
<PB N="22" REF="012464_0021_0F89C9EC325A55C8">
when &s;aints are edified, when they have com|munion with God and Chri&s;t. Now 'tis evi|dent that the Lord Je&s;us is not honoured, when his pre&s;ence in neither of the&s;e re&s;pects is en|joyed, and 'tis but a dull, lifele&s;s formal &s;ervice at be&s;t, that is paid to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Without the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e, our own &s;ouls are not truly profited, and we make no advance at all towards the heavenly world. If we enjoy nothing of the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, we make no advance at all in religion: if the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t is not his hou&s;e, no part of in&s;tituted wor&s;hip will be of any &s;aving good, to any &s;oul. The preacher in this view, preaches in vain, no good will follow without the divine ble&s;&s;ing. No good fruit will follow. Without the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, &s;inners will not be really and truly convinced of their &s;in and danger, &s;inners will not be converted, neither will the children of God be edified and comfort|ed, nor will immortal &s;ouls be &s;avingly profited, and therefore you &s;ee a people ought mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly to de&s;ire, and &s;eek after the &s;piritual pre|&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip. Becau&s;e without this, the Lord of glory is not truly ho|noured, and becau&s;e without this gracious pre|&s;ence of Chri&s;t, our own &s;ouls are not truly be|nefited.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>The pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip is truly its greate&s;t glory.</HI></P>
<P>True it is, that the fir&s;t temple, in it&s;elf con|&s;idered, was much more &s;plendid and magnifi|cent
<PB N="23" REF="012464_0022_0F89C9ECF7B250E8">
than the &s;econd, it was adorned and beauti|fied with gold, &s;o as the latter was not. Yet the in&s;pired writer tells us, the glory of the latter hou&s;e &s;hould be the greate&s;t; and why? Becau&s;e the Son of God, the Prince of Peace, that glori|ous and divine per&s;on, in the days of his huma|nity, &s;hould make his appearance there. Con|text vi vii ver&s;es. For thus, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, yet once, it is a little while, and I will &s;hake the heavens and the earth, and the &s;ea, and the dry land: and I will &s;hake all nations, and the de&s;ire of all nations &s;hall come, and I will fill this hou&s;e with glory, faith the Lord of ho&s;ts. The enemies of the Jews, no doubt, de|rided them, reproached them, and ca&s;t contempt upon them, and upon the hou&s;e they were build|ing. But the prophet by God's direction, com|forts them with the&s;e con&s;iderations, that the Lord would fill the hou&s;e with glory, and that although this hou&s;e had not &s;o much &s;ilver and gold upon it as Solomon's temple had, yet &s;till its glory &s;hould be greater. And why? Becau&s;e the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t the glorious Redeemer, the Prince of Peace &s;hould be enjoyed there. What are outward ornaments, compared with the &s;piritual pre&s;ence of the Redeemer? They are &s;urely nothing in worth and excellency. What are large and &s;pacious buildings? What is ele|gant architecture? What are whited walls? What are paintings and carvings? Are the glo|ry of the&s;e any thing, compared to the enjoy|ment of the pre&s;ence of the Son of God, the con|&s;olation
<PB N="24" REF="012464_0023_0F89C9EEEE69F158">
of I&s;rael in his hou&s;e? No, they are by no means to be compared with it for real worth and glory. The whole congregation may be &s;tupid, unedified, unprofited, let the hou&s;e it&s;elf be never &s;o elegant and grand, outward orna|ments add no power to divine in&s;titutions. But where the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t is enjoyed, &s;ome good is done to precious &s;ouls, they are con|vinced, converted or edified, light and truth is enjoyed, and &s;ouls are help'd forward towards the new Jeru&s;alem. So that 'tis plain this is greater, infinitely greater glory, than any exter|nal glory of the hou&s;e: I don't mean &s;o much as to intimate, that people &s;hould not be &s;olicit|ous what kind of hou&s;es they build for public wor&s;hip, the&s;e ought to be decent and elegant, and at lea&s;t more magnificent than our common dwelling-hou&s;es. And when people are ambi|tious in building &s;uch hou&s;es, ambitious accord|ing to their abilities, to have them &s;tately, mag|nificent and ornamental, 'tis truly a laudale tem|per. But it remains true &s;till, that the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, is really its greate&s;t glory. The external glory of this hou&s;e is va&s;tly greater than the external glory of that which we have now left, and are probably no more publickly to wor&s;hip in. Yet if le&s;s of the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t is enjoyed here, than has been there, it will be in a &s;en&s;e true, that the glory of that hou&s;e is the greate&s;t. But if more of the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t is ever enjoyed here, than has been there, it will be emphatically true,
<PB N="25" REF="012464_0024_0F89C9EF76C98728">
that the glory of this latter hou&s;e is greater than that of the former. Nothing is &s;o ornamental to the &s;oul as grace is. The graces of the &s;pirit implanted there, are its greate&s;t beauty, inconceivably greater than natural endowments. So the greate&s;t glory of the hou&s;e appro|priated to public wor&s;hip, is the &s;piritual pre|&s;ence of Je&s;us there, his &s;peaking peace there to his people. 'Tis this makes it a nur&s;ery for heaven.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to illu&s;trate the general ob&s;ervation. What now remains is by way of</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. We may hence be led to admire the grace of Chri&s;t, that he will afford his pre&s;ence to wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies here below. It was ex|ceeding great grace and conde&s;cention in the eternal Son of God, to take our nature upon him, and in this nature to vi&s;it this &s;inful and fallen world&mdash;to obey the law, and to &s;ubmit to the ignominious death of the cro&s;s, that he might open a way for our return to God, of our enjoying peace with him, and of our being fi|nally happy in his pre&s;ence, in who&s;e pre&s;ence is fullne&s;s of joy. And 'tis grace in the Son of God, now he is a&s;cended up on high, now he is exalted at the right hand of the Father, now he receives the prai&s;es of &s;aints and angels in the heavenly world, to vouch&s;afe his &s;pi|ritual pre&s;ence to wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies in this
<PB N="26" REF="012464_0025_0F89C9F1689EAA98">
world. But though he is a&s;cended on high, yet &s;till he cares for the church on earth, he keeps it and waters it every moment. He of|ten draws near to his people, when they e&s;&s;ay to draw near to him in the &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly, and owns them there, and meets them with a divine ble&s;&s;ing, comes in and &s;ups with them, and they with him.</P>
<P N="2">2. We hence &s;ee how cautious all &s;hould be, le&s;t they do any thing that &s;hall provoke the Son of God to deny his pre&s;ence in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip. We &s;hould beware we don't do this, by introducing any thing into his wor&s;hip that he don't require, or that is contrary to his will. We are to adhere to the things which Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted. We &s;hould take heed that we don't provoke Chri&s;t to deny his pre&s;ence, by coldne&s;s, indifferency and formality in his wor|&s;hip. We &s;hould take heed that we don't, by neglecting to implore, and earne&s;tly &s;eek his pre&s;ence. We &s;hould beware we don't, by an uncharitable, unforgiving temper and di&s;po&s;i|tion towards our fellow-wor&s;hippers. Let all take heed that they do nothing to provoke the Lord of glory to deny his &s;piritual pre&s;ence in his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip. Remember without his pre&s;ence, Chri&s;t is not truly honor'd, and your own &s;ouls are not truly bettered.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence &s;ee how ungrateful they are to Chri&s;t, and carele&s;s of their own &s;ouls, who neglect public wor&s;hip. The wor&s;hipping a&s;|&s;emblies
<PB N="27" REF="012464_0026_0F89C9F218768ED8">
are &s;adly negled by multitudes at this day. An evidence this, of the &s;ad decay of godline&s;s. Had per&s;ons a due &s;en&s;e of the im|portance of this duty, had they but a right concern for their &s;ouls, had they but a right &s;en&s;e of the worth of them; they could not live in the neglect of this important duty, but would be &s;wift to hear the go&s;pel preached&mdash;'Tis owing to the &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, that the go&s;pel is put into our hands, which acquaints us with the great things of our peace, a ble&s;&s;ing denied to multitudes, who are now peri&s;hing for lack of vi&s;ion. 'Tis an illu&s;tri|ous di&s;play of grace in the Prince of Peace, that he is &s;ending his amba&s;&s;adors, to be&s;eech and per&s;uade us to be reconciled unto God, and that we have a free and undi&s;turbed acce&s;s to the hou&s;e of God. A preached go&s;pel is de|&s;igned to do good to &s;ouls, and no doubt but thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands have been really and &s;avingly benefited by it. Faith comes by hear|ing, and hearing, by the word of God. How ungrateful then, are &s;uch to Chri&s;t, and care|le&s;s of their own &s;ouls, who carele&s;sly neglect the public wor&s;hip of God?

<P N="4">4. We may at this time reflect with grati|tude, that the people in this land have been &s;o &s;pirited to build hou&s;es to wor&s;hip God in, and
<PB N="28" REF="012464_0027_0F89C9F2774BF1E0">
that they have enjoyed &s;o much of the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t. As the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of our fore|fathers, in coming into this land, then a howl|ing wilderne&s;s, was the more free enjoyment of religion, according to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences; &s;o the form of religion has all along been kept up, and no doubt much of the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t has been enjoyed, much of the power of religion has been vi&s;ible, and God has all along, from generation to generation, had a number that were a people for his prai&s;e. In this land, the go&s;pel has been preached in the purity of it. The people from generation to generation, have been &s;pirited to build de|cent hou&s;es for public wor&s;hip, &s;pirited to &s;up|port the go&s;pel, and to keep up the wor&s;hip of God.&mdash;This has been the ca&s;e in ge|neral, and e&s;pecially in the&s;e New-England colonies.&mdash;And God has &s;miled upon wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies from time to time, and no doubt ble&s;s'd the provi&s;ion of his hou&s;e, to thou&s;ands who are now rejoicing in glory; and ble&s;s'd it to the &s;aving benefit of thou&s;ands who are now his obedient &s;ervants on earth, and are meetning and preparing for eternal glory.&mdash;The&s;e things call for a grateful remembrance. The&s;e things call for &s;incere and ardent gratitude to the great Father of Lights, from whom comes down every good and perfect gift. And in this view of the ca&s;e, we may well &s;ay, <HI>The lines are fallen to us in a plea&s;ant place.</HI></P>

<P>It is both a joyful and &s;olemn occa&s;ion we are this day met upon; no le&s;s than to dedicate and con&s;ecrate this hou&s;e, erected for the pur|po&s;e of public wor&s;hip, to the u&s;e and &s;ervice of the great and eternal God, and likewi&s;e ar|dently to implore his gracious acceptance of it, as a place where he will record his name, and where he will give peace. O! that every knee may bow in &s;ubjection to God, and every heart be devoutly engaged in a free &s;urrender up of this hou&s;e, to the u&s;e and &s;ervice of the mighty God. And let every heart be engaged, in devout ejaculations to God, that he would gra|ciou&s;ly accept our offering, and that he would record his name here, and that in this place he would give peace.</P>
<P>You have rea&s;on, great rea&s;on to be thank|ful to the great Father of Mercies, that you have deen pro&s;pered in your undertaking, and that your eyes this day behold &s;uch a &s;tately building, now decently fini&s;hed, and &s;o well formed for the pious u&s;e to which it is de&s;igned.

O Lord our God, all this &s;tore that we have prepared to build thee an hou&s;e for thine holy name, cometh of thine hand &amp; is all thine own.</Q> So|lomon when he had fini&s;hed the temple, made a free &s;urrender of it up to God, and God te&s;tified his acceptance of it by a cloud's filling the hou&s;e of the Lord. He approves of the building and fini&s;hing of the temple, as a &s;ervice done to his great and glorious name, and to his kingdom among men. He al&s;o te&s;tified his acceptance of it, as a place where he would record his name, and where he would meet with his people and own and ble&s;s them, by the fire which came down from heaven, and con&s;umed the burnt of|fering and the &s;acrifices. Yea, God expre&s;ly tells king Solomon, he had heard his prayer, and that he had hallowed the hou&s;e which he had built, to put his name there. And as you would have the mighty God accept of this hou&s;e as his, as you would have him record his name here, as you would have him give peace in this place, then, from your hearts, make a free and cordial &s;urrender up of this hou&s;e to God, im|plore his pre&s;ence here, implore his acceptance of it, as a place where he will record his name. And having dedicated the hou&s;e to God, beware you don't provoke him to for&s;ake it, by for&s;ak|ing

of it your&s;elves. Beware you don't, by your coldne&s;s and indifferency, in the duties of the &s;anctuary when you do attend. Beware you don't, by trifling with the &s;olemn means of grace. Beware you don't by cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, by unchari|tablene&s;s, and an unforgiving temper towards one another. You are &s;en&s;ible what long con|te&s;ts and debates you have formerly had, about the place where to erect the hou&s;e, and no doubt, as you have been of very oppo&s;ite and different &s;entiments, &s;o you have had hard thoughts of one-another, uncharitablene&s;s and cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s towards one-another, and no doubt, this differ|ence in &s;entiments, has given ri&s;e to a &s;ad decay of that brotherly love, which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between members of the &s;ame &s;ociety. Now, my advice to all is, to put away all bitterne&s;s, and wrath, and evil-&s;peaking, and to put on bowels of love and charity towards one-another, and &s;tudy to live in love and peace, that your prayers be not hindred. Don't pollute the wor|&s;hip here, by harbouring any envy or ill-will, towards any that you think have been too for|ward, and too engaged to get the hou&s;e erected where it now &s;tands. On the other hand, don't pollute the wor&s;hip here, by harbouring any un|charitable di&s;po&s;ition, towards tho&s;e who you imagine have unrea&s;onably oppo&s;ed the erecting of the hou&s;e in this place. And let all put on that charity which is the bond of perfectne&s;s, that charity which hopeth all things, which put|teth the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction, upon the

words and actions of men. Here meet as bre|thren who profe&s;s the &s;ame religion. Here meet as brethren who profe&s;s to wor&s;hip the God of peace and order. Here meet as bre|thren who profe&s;s to be &s;eeking the &s;ame hea|venly inheritance. Here &s;trive together in prayer according to God's direction. Here unite in &s;ongs of prai&s;e, to him who inhabits the prai&s;es of I&s;rael. You have been at much co&s;t to erect and fini&s;h this hou&s;e, and as you would now en|joy the &s;piritual pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t here, which is the greate&s;t glory of the temple, which is the greate&s;t glory of the inner temple, the &s;oul of man, then let this be a hou&s;e of prayer, and a hou&s;e of prai&s;e. Here be &s;wift to hear the word, and ready to receive in&s;truction. Here attend with &s;teadine&s;s, with &s;incerity and devotion.&mdash;Keep your feet when you go to the hou&s;e of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the &s;a|crifice of fools. Would you have God meet you here, and own and ble&s;s you? Then here &s;eek his pre&s;ence with earne&s;tne&s;s and &s;incerity. Would you have the provi&s;ion of the hou&s;e ble&s;s'd to &s;piritual purpo&s;es? Then humbly and &s;incerely look to God for it. Be &s;trict to adhere to the in&s;titutions of divine wor&s;hip. The &s;anctity and purity of the church, and its &s;trict adherence to divine in&s;titutions, is much more its glory and ornament, than external pomp and &s;plendor. It is truly de&s;irable to have the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in this hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, to have him own and ble&s;s, to &s;piritual purpo&s;es, the provi&s;ion of

his hou&s;e, to have him pour out his &s;pirit here, for the conviction and conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and for the edification and comfort of &s;aints. Surely this is what we ought all of us to de&s;ire, this is what we ought earne&s;tly to &s;eek after, this more than any external pomp and &s;plendor, is the true glory of the hou&s;e. And notwith&s;tanding this hou&s;e va&s;tly excels that which we have now left, (which has long been a hou&s;e of wor|&s;hip) in outward &s;plendor and magnificence, yet if more of the pre&s;ence of Je&s;us is ever enjoyed here, than has been there, it will be emphatically true, that the glory of this latter hou&s;e is the greate&s;t. As &s;inners would be awakned and converted, and made partakers of a &s;piritual life, as &s;aints would be edified and comforted, as they would increa&s;e in purity and holine&s;s, then let them take heed, that they dont for&s;ake the a&s;|&s;embling them&s;elves together, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ocial wor&s;hip, as the manner of &s;ome is, but wait at wi&s;dom's gates, and watch at the po&s;ts of her doors. In a word, <Q>would you grow in knowledge and grace? Would you be pre|pared to wor&s;hip with an innumerable com|pany of angels, and in the general a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t born above, than which no|thing is more de&s;irable? then with frequency and delight, repair to the tabernacle of God, the congregations of his people here on earth, for the&s;e are nur&s;eries for heaven.</Q></P>

You have heard how the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t adorns the temple, and this is the greate&s;t orna|ment the &s;oul can have. The lovely graces of &s;pirit, love, joy, peace, gentlene&s;s, meekne&s;s and temperance, do mightily embelli&s;h, and adorn the &s;oul of man. 'Tis your highe&s;t intere&s;t and glory, to be like Chri&s;t in purity and holine&s;s, and to be imitators of him, in meekne&s;s and lowline&s;s of heart. It nearly concerns you to have intere&s;t in him, who &s;aves his people from the &s;econd death, and to &s;tand related to him as a Saviour and Redeemer, and as his loyal &s;ubjects and Servants. He is the way, the truth and the life: neither is there &s;alvation in any other: our glory and happine&s;s ari&s;es from our relation to Chri&s;t, our likene&s;s to him, intere&s;t in him, and communion with him. The &s;oul in which the Son of God has &s;et up his kingdom, the &s;oul in which he dwells by his &s;pirit, the &s;oul which he has adorn'd with the lovely train of chri&s;tian graces, is more beautiful and glorious than ever Solomon's temple was, and will be &s;o through the never ending ages of eternity. Let all then &s;ee to it, that they cordially receive Chri&s;t as their Lord and Saviour, that they bow the knee in &s;ubjection to him who is King in Zion, that they be his obedient &s;ubjects and &s;ervants, and that they wor&s;hip the Lord with &s;incerity and pure devotion, in his temples here below, that &s;o they may be prepared to wor&s;hip in the temple above, which endures for ever and ever, than which nothing is more de&s;irable.</P>
