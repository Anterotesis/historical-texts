<P>HOW awful and awak'ning are the&s;e <HI>Words!</HI> Eno' to &s;trike the heart of the hardie&s;t Sinner with the utmo&s;t fear! As the hand-writing on the wall over again&s;t <HI>Bel&s;hazzar</HI> changed his countenance, loo&s;|ed the joynts of his loins, and his knees &s;mote one again&s;t another.</P>
<P>THE <HI>words</HI> come in the clo&s;e of an excellent <HI>Warning</HI> again&s;t wilful &amp; pre&s;umptuous di&s;obe|dience to the Go&s;pel, &amp; apo&s;tacy from it. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> warns the pre&s;umptuous &amp; apo&s;tate Sin|ner of the righteous and terrible <HI>Vengeance</HI> of God: <HI>For we know him that hath &s;aid, Vengeance be|belongeth unto Me, I will recompence &s;aith the Lord: And again, The Lord &s;hall judge his people: It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God.</HI></P>

<P>I need not &s;eek for any <HI>Doctrine</HI> out of the words of the <HI>Text</HI>: No words of mine can be like awful, in&s;tructive and awakning.</P>
<Q><HI>DOCT.</HI> IT is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living GOD.</Q>
<P>THE <HI>Text</HI> may be opened and confirmed in the following <HI>Enquiries.</HI> 1. What is meant by this Title, the <HI>living God</HI>? 2. What by the <HI>Hands</HI> of the <HI>living God</HI>? 2. What it is to <HI>fall</HI> into the hands of the living God? 4. In what re&s;pects it is &s;o <HI>fearful</HI> a thing to fall into his hands?</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT is the Import and meaning of this Title, the <HI>living God?</HI></P>
<P>IT is the glorious and <HI>proper</HI> Name of the <HI>true</HI> God, and many times given him in his Word. Jer. 10.10. <HI>The Lord is the true God, he is the living God.</HI> Mat. 16.16. <HI>Thou art Chri&s;t, the &s;on of the living God.</HI> Now</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>living</HI> God means the <HI>Eternal</HI> God. <HI>The Lord, the Everla&s;ting God.</HI> He is the <HI>living One</HI> who ever was, is and will be, without be|ginning or end. Jer. 10.10. <HI>The living God and the Everla&s;ting King.</HI> P&s;al. 90.2. <HI>From Everla&s;ting to Everla&s;ting Thou art God.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="002737_0005_0FE5F43807B246A0">2. THE <HI>living</HI> God &s;peaks his <HI>Self exi&s;tence.</HI> Eternal exi&s;tence nece&s;&s;arily implies <HI>this.</HI> John 5.26. <HI>The Father hath life in him&s;elf.</HI> "God's life is his own: It is originated in Him&s;elf <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> on the <HI>Catechi&s;m.</HI></NOTE>, and not derived from another". He is life e&s;&s;ential and original.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>living</HI> God &s;peaks a life always the <HI>&s;ame.</HI> The immutability and unchangeablene&s;s of God is plainly contained in this <HI>Title.</HI> Dan. 6.26. <HI>The living God, and stedfast for ever.</HI></P>
<P>GOD's Name is &mdash; <HI>I am that I am.</HI> This is to <HI>live,</HI> and to be the <HI>living One.</HI> I am the Lord, <HI>I change not.</HI> He who is <HI>the &s;ame ye&s;ter|day, to day and for ever, with whom is no varia|blene&s;s nor &s;hadow of turning,</HI> He it is that <HI>liveth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>living</HI> God means the <HI>Fountain of life</HI> to all Creatures. P&s;al 36.9. <HI>For with thee is the fountain of life. Angels</HI> are living Beings, and <HI>Man</HI> is a living Soul, but <HI>God</HI> gives the Being and Life both to the one and other; up|holds them in life, and pre&s;erves the Spirits. <HI>In Him they live and move and have their being; for they are his Offspring. He giveth unto all life and breath and all things.</HI></P>
<P>ONLY the <HI>Eternal Son,</HI> the <HI>Only begotten,</HI> hath life <HI>in him&s;elf,</HI> even as the <HI>Father hath life in him&s;elf.</HI> He therefore is no creature: He is the <HI>true God and eternal life.</HI> Life natural and &s;piritual are of him and from him toge|ther with the Father. He is the <HI>Everla&s;ting

Father</HI> and the living God. John 1.4. <HI>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>living</HI> God is in oppo&s;ition to <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Gods, Idols &amp; Images, which are <HI>dead</HI> things. The <HI>Stocks</HI> and the graven Images which &s;tupid men have called <HI>Gods,</HI> were lifele&s;s things; and the <HI>Heroes</HI> whom the Nations have ignorantly dei|fied and wor&s;hipp'd were dying or dead men. <HI>The molten Image is fal&s;hood,</HI> becau&s;e there is no <HI>breath</HI> in it. <HI>The portion of Jacob</HI> is not like it; He is <HI>Jehovah, Him that liveth.</HI> Life and death are ju&s;t in that contradiction the one to the other that the true God is to all fal&s;e ones. Act. 14.15. <HI>We preach to you that you &s;hould turn from the&s;e vanities to the living God.</HI> 1 The&s;. 1 9. <HI>Ye turned to God from Idols, to &s;erve the living and true GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>reproach</HI> of Idols and of Idolaters is <HI>that the living &s;eek to the dead.</HI> I&s;ai. 8.19. And it &s;hould be <HI>hateful</HI> to a living Soul to wor&s;hip <HI>the deaf, the blind &amp; the dumb.</HI> 2 Sam. 5.8. <HI>The hated of David's &s;oul.</HI> He means the Idol, the <HI>Palladium,</HI> of the <HI>Jebu&s;ites,</HI> in which they fot|ti&s;hly tru&s;ted.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE <HI>living</HI> God may mean the <HI>activity</HI> of the life of God beyond that of all Creatures. God is the <HI>mo&s;t active life.</HI> His infinite wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s in everla&s;ting activity, this is <HI>life.</HI> In Him is life, and the life is the light of all worlds, of all creatures in them that have life.</P>
<P>HOW many va&s;t <HI>Worlds,</HI> and millions of mil|lions
<PB N="5" REF="002737_0007_0FE5F4399F128B48">
of <HI>living &s;pirits,</HI> and <HI>moving creatures</HI> that have life, has the <HI>living God</HI> produc|ed, and continually pre&s;erves? The life of Angels and Men, bea&s;ts and all cattle, creeping things and flying fowl, and what&s;oever pa&s;&s;eth thro' the paths of the Sea, is communi|cated from him daily, and upheld by him. What an <HI>Active</HI> life is this? which <HI>worketh hi|therto, &amp; yet works</HI> ince&s;&s;antly, in the mo&s;t per|fect ea&s;e, thro' all worlds, thro' all time!</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Agency</HI> and activity is plainly intima|ted in my <HI>text,</HI> which &s;peaks of the <HI>hands</HI> of of the living God, and of <HI>falling</HI> into them. The <HI>Hand</HI> is for <HI>working,</HI> and for <HI>&s;triking</HI> if need be; for expedite and lively working, and for terrible &s;triking. In both re&s;pects it intimates a life the mo&s;t <HI>active</HI> imaginable.</P>
<P>BUT I come to the <HI>Second</HI> Enquiry,</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT are the <HI>Hands</HI> of the living GOD?</P>
<P>TO be &s;ure nothing like <HI>mens</HI> hands, and much le&s;s the lifele&s;s carved hands of an Image. God has no hands nor bodily parts, is not fle&s;h and blood as we are; but He is an <HI>Infinite E&s;&s;ence,</HI> the <HI>Immen&s;e Spirit,</HI> filling heaven and earth. When he &s;hewed his Glory to the Elders of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they &s;aw no &s;imilitude. And when he gave his Commandments from <HI>Sinai,</HI> the <HI>&s;econd</HI> of them was&mdash; <HI>Thou &s;halt not make unto thee any likene&s;s of any thing that is in Heaven above, or

on the earth beneath.</HI> But in conde&s;cention to our weakne&s;s, and to help us in our ideas and conceptions of God in his works of Providence and Grace, He has pleas'd to &s;peak to us of his eyes and hands and feet; to let us know that he ever &s;ees us and concerns him&s;elf for us, in ways both of mercy &amp; of judgment, as it &s;eems good to his wi&s;dom and holine&s;s. And accord|ingly by the <HI>hands</HI> of the living God we mu&s;t under&s;tand,</P>
<P N="1">1. His eternal <HI>Power,</HI> his "<HI>lively</HI> power and &s;trength, together with his active <HI>Providence</HI> and univer&s;al agency, upholding and governing all his Creatures in all their motions &amp; actions. <HI>In his</HI> hands <HI>are the deep places of the earth, the &s;trength of the hills is his al&s;o: He holdeth the waters in the hollow of his</HI> hand, <HI>and in it is the &s;oul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</HI> The &s;ame Almighty <HI>hand</HI> that form'd and fa&s;hion'd us, al&s;o holdeth our &s;oul in life&punc; It is the <HI>good</HI> hand of the Lord our God upon us, and out of it proceedeth all the <HI>evil</HI> that befalls us. Job 2.10. <HI>Shall we receive good at the hand of the Lord? and &s;hall we not receive evil?</HI></P>
<P>THERE is in the governing and all di&s;po&s;ing Providence of God his <HI>protecting hand</HI> which is &s;afe and comfortable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE>; his <HI>&s;upplying</HI> hand which is full and open, munificent and liberal: And there is al&s;o his "<HI>correcting hand</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary, good and beneficial; and his <HI>wrathful</HI> hand which is fearful, dreadful and terrible.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="002737_0009_0FE61B9937DE4AB8">2. BY the <HI>hands</HI> of the living God is meant in my <HI>text</HI> his <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> power and <HI>wrath,</HI> which are again&s;t all them that provoke him <HI>His wrathful anger takes hold of them,</HI> P&s;alm 69.24. You read of <HI>the&s;e</HI> hands, Deut. 32.40, 41. <HI>I lift up my hand to heaven and &s;wear, I live for ever</HI>! (O &s;ee there the fearful hand of the living God! the hand of him that lives for ever, lift up in &s;wearing by Him&s;elf) <HI>if I whet my glit|tering &s;word, and my</HI> hand <HI>take hold of judgment, I will render vengeance to my enemies, and reward, them hate me.</HI> The&s;e are the Hands that &s;mite and wound, and tear and rend to pieces what|ever &s;tands in the way of his Holine&s;s. God's wrath in temporal Judgments is his fearful hand: 1 Sam. 5.6. <HI>The hand of the Lord was again&s;t them of A&s;hdod, and he &s;mote them with emerods and de&s;troyed them.</HI> But how much more is there the fearful hand of God in &s;pi|ritual and eternal judgments?</P>
<P N="3">3. BY the <HI>hands</HI> of the living God we may under&s;tand "<HI>his own immediate puni&s;hing</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE>, as the &s;piritual and eternal puni&s;hment of the wicked is.

Our <HI>Context</HI> points us to this immediate revenging hand of God, &mdash; <HI>For we know him that &s;aith, Vengeance is
<PB N="8" REF="002737_0010_0FE61BA5DB4216A0">
mine, I will recompence, &s;aith the Lord: It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</HI> The immediate, infinite and eternal Vengeance of God is the thing here &s;poken of; the vials of his wrath in the next life, not the few &s;calding drops of it in this only. And O the <HI>hand,</HI> the power and force of this vindic|tive wrath! This future and everla&s;ting mi&s;ery of apo&s;tate and impenitent &s;inners "comes from God's own hand. "When he puni&s;hes by Creatures (as One has it) the In&s;trument abates &s;omething of the force of the blow, but the weight of his own hand is infinite Mi&s;ery. This they &s;hall have of God's hand, to ly down in &s;orrows for ever; endle&s;s and in&s;up|portable. Their de&s;truction &s;hall come <HI>from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</HI> 2 The&s;&s;. 1.9.</P>
<P>BUT this for the meaning of God's <HI>hand</HI> in the <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. WHAT is it to <HI>fall</HI> into the hands of the living God?</P>
<P>IT cannot mean or &s;uppo&s;e that we are ever <HI>out</HI> of his hand. No, we are always in it; both Saints and Sinners are &s;o. <HI>All his Saints are in his hand,</HI> the hand of his Mercy, power and grace; and all his <HI>enemies</HI> are in the &s;trong hand of his Ju&s;tice. <HI>Whither can we go from his Spirit? and whither can we flee from
<PB N="9" REF="002737_0011_0FE61BA5E35578A0">
his pre&s;ence? If we take the wings of the morn|ing and dwell in the uttermo&s;t parts of the &s;ea, even there &s;hall his hand lead us, and his right hand &s;hall hold us.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is indeed a falling into the <HI>hands</HI> of Divine wi&s;dom and <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> grace and mer|cy; a <HI>ca&s;ting</HI> our &s;elves into them, and God's <HI>taking</HI> us into them. 1 Sam. 24.14. <HI>Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are great.</HI> We mu&s;t look to the helping and &s;aving hand of God, and &s;ay, <HI>Hold thou me up and I &s;hall be &s;afe! Into thy hand I commit my Spirit!</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;inners fall into the hand of Divine <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> when it lays hold of them to puni&s;h them for their iniquities; when it falls upon them as it were to &s;lay them. When God judges &s;inners in his righteous and terrible Providence, or when his wrath falls upon their Con&s;ciences, or when Death arre&s;ts them to carry them in their impenitence to the Judg|ment &s;eat of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to the place of ever|la&s;ting torments; then, then do they fall into hand of the living God. When God &s;ays to evil angels, or to death, or to the tormentors after death, as <HI>David</HI> did to the young man, Go fall upon this <HI>Amalekite; And he &s;mote him that he died.</HI> It is as when one falls into the hand of a powerful <HI>Enemy</HI>; or rather as when a <HI>Criminal</HI> falls into the hand of Ju&s;tice, and it is arre&s;ted, arraigned, convicted, condemned to die and executed. All impenitent &s;inners are
<PB N="10" REF="002737_0012_0FE61BA78C7A5DD0">
always in the hand of God's <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> under his wrath and cur&s;e, under the Sentence of eternal death. And not &s;eldom they fall into the hand of his <HI>Judgments</HI> here in this life, both as to &s;oul and body. But it is e&s;pecially at <HI>Death</HI> and in the day of <HI>Judgment,</HI> that they fall into the hand of the living God. Then it is laid upon them, lays hold of them, holds them fa&s;t, and falls upon them. This is the <HI>Second death.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>WHY</HI> is it &s;o <HI>fearful</HI> a thing to fall into the hand of the living God? I an&s;wer, 1. Becau&s;e the power and wrath of God is in|finite and in&s;upportable. 2. Becau&s;e it is eter|nal and everla&s;ting.</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE the power and wrath of God is <HI>infinite,</HI> intolerable, and in&s;upportable. P&s;a. 90.11. <HI>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear &s;o is thy wrath.</HI> It is infinitely beyond all that we can fear or ap|prehend. P&s;alm 76.7. <HI>Thou, even Thou art to be feared, and who may &s;tand in thy &s;ight when once thou art angry?</HI> Nahum 1.5, 6. <HI>The mountains quake at Him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt up at his pre&s;ence; yea the world and all that dwell therein: Who can &s;tand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fiercene&s;s of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</HI> Say now if it be not a <HI>fearful</HI> thing to fall into
<PB N="11" REF="002737_0013_0FE61BA7964C09D0">
the wrathful hand of this Infinite power! The wrath of an earthly <HI>King</HI> is as the roar|ing of a <HI>lion</HI>; but to what can we compare the wrath of the Infinite God? How terrible was the wrath of the King, which the three <HI>Wor|thies</HI> among the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> feared not, tho' it raged again&s;t them? Dan. 3.19. <HI>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his vi&s;age was changed again&s;t Shadrach, Me|&s;hach and Abednego; therefore he &s;pake and com|manded that they &s;hould heat the furnace one &s;even times more than it was wont to be heat; And he commanded the mo&s;t mighty men that were in his army to bind and ca&s;t them into the burning fiery furnace.</HI> This is but a little image of the fiercene&s;s of the wrath of God, which will ca&s;t &s;inners into <HI>the pit that burneth with fire and brim&s;tone.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE wrath and vengeance of the living God is <HI>Eternal</HI> and <HI>Everla&s;ting</HI>; and this it is that renders it &s;o <HI>fearful</HI> a thing to fall into his hand. The <HI>living</HI> God lives for ever to puni&s;h. He can and will inflict wrath for ever and ever. He lives to uphold the Soul under everla&s;ting Sufferings.</P>
<P>IT is true that he could annihilate the Soul, and bring it to nothing: But he has made it immortal, made it for immortality, and it cannot die, it &s;hall live for ever, tho' in in|&s;upportable torments.</P>
<P>GOD is unchangeable Truth, and inflexible Holine&s;s. He has &s;worn and will not repent.
<PB N="12" REF="002737_0014_0FE61BB1706918D0">
He lives for ever and his hand takes hold of Judgment. &mdash; Yea his life and being is the mo&s;t <HI>active</HI> imaginable, both as to puni&s;hing and rewarding. The living God is not like <HI>indolent</HI> Idols. He has hands and <HI>u&s;es</HI> them. And all his power and anger is in <HI>everla&s;ting activity</HI> again&s;t the wicked. P&s;alm 7.12. <HI>He will what his &s;word, he hath bent his bow and made it ready; he hath al&s;o prepared for him the in&s;truments of death.</HI> P&s;alm 11.6. <HI>Upon the wicked he &s;hall rain &s;nares, fire and brim&s;tone, and an horrible tempe&s;t; this &s;hall be the portion of their cup.</HI> &mdash; But the terriblene&s;s of this active vengeance is, that it is <HI>Eternal</HI>; the vengeance of <HI>everla&s;ting fire.</HI> Jude ver. 7.</P>
<P>THE living God inflicts eternal death on tho&s;e whom he damns. The eternal damna|tion of the wicked proceeds from eternal life in Him. The <HI>Sentence</HI> therefore runs thus; Mat. 25.41. <HI>Depart from Me ye cur&s;ed into everlasting fire.</HI> The living God pa&s;&s;es this Sentence, and he lives for ever to &s;ee it exe|cuting, through all the ages of Eternity. 2 The&s;&s;. 1.9. <HI>Who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with ever|la&s;ting destruction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</HI></P>
<P>THE damned after the Day of Judgment will be as much in the wrathful hands of the living God as they were before. The hand that ca&s;ts them into hell will hold them down therein. <HI>Hell is naked before him and de&s;truction hath no covering.</HI> Once in tho&s;e living hands
<PB N="13" REF="002737_0015_0FE61BB1B019B0B0">
and there for ever. O eternal horror! how fearful a thing to think of!</P>
<Q><L>For ever? fatal word! for ever? who</L>
<L>Can bear the doom of Everla&s;ting woe <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore.</HI></NOTE>?</L></Q>
<P>THIS de&s;truction from the Almighty &s;hould be indeed a terror to us. It is revealed to us for this end, in &s;o many fearful and terrifying de&s;criptions. Mark 3.29. <HI>In danger of Eternal damnation.</HI> O what a danger, what a hazard is that? what a fearful condition for a poor Soul to be in? Mat. 3.5. <HI>He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</HI> The chaff is &s;uch dry &s;tuff that though it yield a vehement and fierce flame, yet it is pre&s;ently over and out. But though &s;inners are no better than chaff, and the fire in their Con&s;ciences will be a mo&s;t vehement flame, yet it will never abate and much le&s;s go out, but rage on for ever &amp; ever.

<P>THE mi&s;erable <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> to whom, and at who&s;e de&s;ire the forgoing <HI>Sermon</HI> was preached, were <HI>Samuel Cole</HI> and <HI>Henry Greenvill.</HI> There was al&s;o pre&s;ent with them <HI>George Condick.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Captain</HI> of the Pirates, <HI>William Fly,</HI> re|fu&s;ed to come into publick. I mov'd the others for <HI>his</HI> &s;ake, to let me preach to them in pri|vate: But they &s;aid, It was the la&s;t <HI>Sabbath</HI> they had to live, and they earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be in an <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> of Wor&s;hippers, that they might have the <HI>Prayers</HI> of many together over them, and that others might take the more <HI>warning</HI> by them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Story</HI> of the&s;e wretched men is &s;hort and tragical. They &s;ail'd from <HI>Jamaica</HI> on board a <HI>Snoe, John Green</HI> Commander, bound to <HI>Guinea.</HI> They had not been long at Sea be|fore they con&s;pired to &s;eize the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Mate,</HI> and then go a <HI>pirating.</HI> On the 27th of <HI>May</HI> 1726. they put in execution their wicked de&s;ign, in a mo&s;t cruel and barbarous manner. About one a clock in the morning, <HI>William Fly</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="002737_0032_0FE61BE9F32B8490">
then <HI>Boat&s;wain</HI> of the <HI>Snoe Elizabeth,</HI> after he had been &s;ome time forward with &s;everal of the <HI>Sailors,</HI> came aft with <HI>Alexander Mitchel</HI> and others, and &s;aid to <HI>Morrice Cunden (Gun|ner</HI> of the Ship) then at helm,
<Q>D&mdash;n you, you dog, if you &s;tir hand or foot, or &s;peak a word, I'll blow your brains out.</Q>
And im|mediately thereupon he went into the <HI>Cab|bin</HI> where <HI>Captain Green</HI> was in bed, and <HI>Alexander Mitchel</HI> follow'd him; and while they were there <HI>Morrice Cunden</HI> heard the <HI>Captain</HI> cry out, <HI>What's the matter</HI>? But they &s;oon hawl'd him upon deck, and were about to throw him into the Sea; when the poor man begg'd of them to &s;pare his life, &s;aying, <Q><HI>For God's &s;ake</HI> Boat&s;wain <HI>don't throw me over board, for if you do I &s;hall go to hell.</HI></Q> But though in the angui&s;h and amazement of his &s;oul he thus pleaded with them, that they would not &s;end him down quick into hell, for that he was not fit to die; yet his plea made no impre&s;&s;ion at all upon their hardned hearts. <HI>Fly</HI> bid him &s;ay after him the&s;e words, <Q><HI>Lord have mercy upon my &s;oul</HI>;</Q> and away they hurried the poor &s;urpris'd and a&s;toni&s;h'd man overboard. It is affirmed that he caught hold of a rope and held for his life, which when one of the wretches &s;aw he cut off his hand with an ax; and &s;o he dropt into Eternity.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time &s;ome others of this <HI>bloody crew</HI> &s;urpris'd the <HI>Mate</HI> of the Ship, <HI>Thomas

Jenkins.</HI> And <HI>Thomas Streaton</HI> (the <HI>Carpenter</HI> of the Ship) depo&s;ed that he heard <HI>Samuel Cole</HI> &s;ay to <HI>Jenkins,</HI> <Q><HI>Come out of your Cabbin, you dog!</HI></Q> and pre&s;ently he was hawl'd out, and told <Q><HI>that he &s;hould go overboard after his Captain.</HI></Q> When he was in the Sea he was heard calling earne&s;tly to the <HI>Doctor</HI> to hand him a rope. But the <HI>Doctor</HI> was by this time him&s;elf putting into Irons.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>bloodily</HI> the&s;e inhumane Creatures began their <HI>Piracy,</HI> but Vengeance follow'd them and &s;uffer'd them not to live.</P>
<P><HI>William Fly,</HI> the chief and wor&s;t (we may &s;uppo&s;e) of the&s;e barbarous rogues, took on him the Command, and named the <HI>Snoe</HI> the <HI>Fames Revenge.</HI> They were well &s;tored with <HI>Powder,</HI> and <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Provi&s;ions,</HI> but wanted a better <HI>Ve&s;&s;el</HI>; and in que&s;t of this it is likely they bent their cour&s;e fir&s;t to <HI>Carolina</HI> and from thence to <HI>New England.</HI> On the <HI>third</HI> of <HI>June</HI> they took a <HI>Sloop</HI> at Anchor off <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> on board of which was Mr. <HI>William Atkin&s;on</HI> a Pa&s;&s;enger; who was afterwards the happy In&s;trument in the hand of God for their de&s;truction. They very much needed one &s;o well skill'd as <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> was both as a <HI>Mariner</HI> and <HI>Pilot,</HI> and <HI>Fly</HI> treated him well on that account, but kept a &s;trict eye upon him, forbidding him to have any conver&s;ation
<PB N="32" REF="002737_0034_0FE61BFAB6278680">
with the forc'd men; and le&s;t he &s;hould he had a hammock given him in the <HI>Cabbin.</HI></P>
<P>THEY commanded him to carry them to <HI>Martha's Vineyard</HI> in order to wood and water there, and in hopes to meet with &s;ome Sloop &s;itting for their purpo&s;e <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This is Mr. <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI>'s own Account of things.</NOTE>: But he re&s;olved to run the venture of carrying them pa&s;t the <HI>Vine|yard,</HI> and run them up into or near the <HI>Bay</HI> before they were aware of it. When they perceiv'd it they began to look upon him with an evil eye, &amp; &s;pake of throwing him overboard. But as <HI>Fly</HI> was uttering his rage at him the next morning on this account, and telling him what death he &s;hould die if any thing ill be|fell them thro' his conduct, a <HI>Schooner</HI> came in &s;ight which put an end to <HI>Fly</HI>'s rage, for the joy of a good Prize. They found it a <HI>Schooner</HI> of <HI>Marblehead, George Girdler</HI> Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> had &s;ome time before this meditated the &s;eizing on <HI>Fly</HI> and Company, and found means &s;ecretly to communicate his mind to &s;ome on board, whom he thought he might tru&s;t; particularly to <HI>Samuel Walker,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Streaton</HI>; and <HI>Walker</HI> had &s;poken of it to <HI>James Benbrook</HI>; who all con&s;ented if a fair opportunity &s;hould offer.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002737_0035_0FE61BFAC25215F0">IT was very nece&s;&s;ary to his de&s;ign to <HI>ingra|tiate</HI> him&s;elf, as far as he hone&s;tly and with a good con&s;cience could, with <HI>Fly</HI> and his Pirates. Yet in doing this he ran a <HI>ri&s;que</HI> both of his innocence and his life: Of his <HI>In|nocence,</HI> for <HI>with a furious man thou &s;halt not go, le&s;t thou learn his ways and get a &s;nare to thy &s;oul</HI>; And of his <HI>Life,</HI> for as &s;ome of the <HI>Pi|rates,</HI> the <HI>Captain</HI> e&s;pecially, began to think friendly of him and to hearken to his Ad|vice; (they all depending on him to navigate the Ship) &s;o if a <HI>Ship of War</HI> had taken them it is to be feared that he had in vain pleaded his innocence and good intentions. But the good God who pre&s;erv'd, has al&s;o pleaded his innocence. And we ought to prai&s;e his virtue, conduct and courage, and give God the glory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fly</HI> had no &s;ooner taken the <HI>Schooner</HI> of <HI>Marblehead,</HI> but they di&s;covered another at a di&s;tance from them. Whereupon he put <HI>three</HI> men on board the <HI>Schooner,</HI> and purpo&s;ed to bear down on the new <HI>Sail</HI> with both his Ve&s;|&s;els. But Mr. <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> with a ready thought advi&s;ed him to put <HI>&s;ix</HI> men into the <HI>Schooner</HI> and &s;end her down on the fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els, being her &s;elf one of their company but a day before, and &s;o there would be no likelyhood of their flying from her: but (&s;aid he) if the <HI>Snoe</HI> and the <HI>Schooner</HI> now bear down together they'll take you for what you are, and make away
<PB N="34" REF="002737_0036_0FE61BFBCBF036A0">
from you. <HI>Fly</HI> came into his advice and put three men more into the <HI>Schooner,</HI> and parted with her, &s;tanding a cour&s;e wide from her.</P>
<P>NOW <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI>'s thoughts were hard at work how to draw <HI>Fly</HI> away from his <HI>Arms</HI> on the quarter-deck. For there he kept alone, nor would &s;uffer <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> to &s;tep up, &s;o much as to &s;et down the <HI>Bowl</HI> of punch after he had drank to him. And probably a Me&s;&s;age which he receiv'd from a chief <HI>Pirate</HI> on board the <HI>Schooner,</HI> by the boat, <Q><HI>To have a &s;pecial care of his Friend,</HI></Q> did increa&s;e his jealou&s;ie; tho' he &s;eem'd only to laugh at it.</P>
<P>WITHIN a little while <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> &s;pied a <HI>Sail</HI> a head to the <HI>Leward,</HI> and informed <HI>Fly</HI> of it. And pre&s;ently after he pretended to di&s;cover two or three more &s;ail, and told him he would have a <HI>fleet</HI> of prizes. But <HI>Fly</HI> with his gla&s;s could &s;ee but <HI>one.</HI> Why &s;aid <HI>Atkin&s;on,</HI> If you were but here, Sir, with your gla&s;s, a-head, you would ea&s;ily &s;ee them all. On a &s;udden <HI>Fly</HI> forgat his caution, and comes off the quarter-deck, where his arms lay, and &s;ets him down a-head to &s;py the Sails &s;poken of. Then <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> gave the &s;ign to his friends, and <HI>Walker</HI> follow'd by <HI>Benbrook</HI> came up, pretending at fir&s;t to direct the <HI>Cap|tain</HI> to look a point or two on &s;uch a &s;ide, while <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> (a &s;pare and &s;lender man) pa&s;s'd aft toward the <HI>Arms,</HI> and in the in&s;tant
<PB N="35" REF="002737_0037_0FE61BFBD4BF91B8">
that <HI>Walker</HI> laid hold of <HI>Fly</HI> he took the fire|arms, and returned pointing the gun to the <HI>Pirate's</HI> brea&s;t, and telling him
<Q>He was a dead man if he did not immediately &s;ubmit him&s;elf his pri&s;oner.</Q>
The wicked <HI>Fly</HI> earne&s;tly <HI>begg'd</HI> for his life, and now found that <HI>mercy</HI> which he had &s;o barbarou&s;ly denied to his <HI>innocent Captain.</HI></P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of this &s;truggle the Pirate <HI>Greenvil</HI> put up his head from between decks: for there as Providence order'd it He and <HI>Condick</HI> were at this in&s;tant; and as for the pirate <HI>Cole</HI> he had been in <HI>Irons</HI> for two days before, by <HI>Fly</HI>'s order, for &s;ome mutiny he had made. This it was that render'd the &s;ubdu|ing them &s;o ea&s;y to <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> and his three Com|panions: for now <HI>Streaton</HI> had fallen in, and guarded one place, while <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> did the other, keeping the Pirates down. The Action was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing to the other <HI>Forc'd Men,</HI> that for a time they &s;tood a&s;tonied and like Men amazed, not capable of acting for their own deliverance; altho' vehemently call'd upon and threatned by <HI>Atkin&s;on.</HI> But in a little time they came to them&s;elves and joyfully fell in with their <HI>De|liverers.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Fly</HI> found him&s;elf chain'd down and effectually &s;ecur'd, he fell at times into the mo&s;t de&s;perate <HI>ragings,</HI> cur&s;ing him&s;elf and her that bare him, and the Day wherein he was born;
<PB N="36" REF="002737_0038_0FE61C124E946818">
cur&s;ing the very heavens &amp; in effect the <HI>God</HI> that judged him; Cur&s;ing all <HI>rovers</HI> that &s;hould ever give quarter again to an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>; and wi&s;h|ing all the devils of hell would come and fly away with the Ship: The &s;ame <HI>Bla&s;phemer</HI> now in his furious <HI>de&s;pair,</HI> or wor&s;e than he ever was before in his <HI>jollity</HI> and pride; when he wou'd &s;ometimes even dare to ridicule the noi&s;e of Gods <HI>Thunder,</HI> as it rattled over him, Saying, <Q><HI>That they were playing bowls in the Air,</HI></Q> &amp;c. and as the <HI>Lightnings</HI> &s;ometimes fla&s;h'd upon them, he would &s;ay &mdash; <Q><HI>Who fires now? Stand by,</HI></Q> &amp;c. &mdash; So he dar'd the dreadful Vengeance, which per&s;u'd him &s;wift as the <HI>Lightnings</HI> and &s;uddenly &s;truck him.</P>
<P>BUT Capt. <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> and his brave <HI>Mates</HI> are much to be prais'd, that they dealt &s;o <HI>merci|fully</HI> with the&s;e <HI>bloody Men</HI>; and neither <HI>blew their brains out</HI> (their own phra&s;e) nor threw them overboard. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God that kept them that day from &s;hedding blood, and from avenging them&s;elves with their own hands.</HI> It was much better to re&s;erve the <HI>Murderers</HI> to the Judgment of the <HI>Law,</HI> in the proper cour&s;e of it. Hereby the guilty <HI>Mi&s;erables</HI> had a &s;pace granted them for <HI>repentance,</HI> and were bro't under the happy <HI>means</HI> of it; Means <HI>happy</HI> we hope to two of them, namely <HI>Greenvil</HI> and <HI>Cole.</HI></P>
