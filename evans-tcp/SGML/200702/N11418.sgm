<HEAD>APPENDIX. TO THE CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE foregoing &s;heets were fir&s;t publi&s;hed in April, 1774, and we are now in the next November; time and events have, in the &s;hort intervening &s;pace of &s;even months, but too plainly and too &s;trongly confirmed the opinions re&s;pecting our American mea&s;ures, and their con|&s;equences, which were then pre&s;umed by the author to be laid before the public. It is in the preceding pages explain|ed, that the plan propo&s;ed, and confided in by the Admini|&s;tration on that occa&s;ion, appeared to be, that the removal of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the commerce of Bo&s;ton, would &s;oon bring on their knees, and &s;ubject to our commands, the inhabitants of that town and of its colony; who were by that means to become, be&s;ides their own obe|dience, an example likewi&s;e and a terror to the re&s;t of their brethren on that continent; but the policy and the probability of this fine &s;pun &s;cheme are there doubted of, que&s;tioned and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. It is repre&s;ented, that the har&s;h and violent mea&s;ures then carrying on, would in America be received no otherwi&s;e than as a declaration of war, and depend upon the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue; that it could only be by force and by conque&s;t, if they were &s;ubmitted to; that we mu&s;t expect to have to do with an union of that continent; that it would among them be made a common cau&s;e not to be taxed by us, and that they would certainly join, combine and a&s;&s;ociate together for their general and mutual a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and defence. Is there any occa&s;ion to &s;ay whether or no the&s;e things have proved true?</P>
<P>We were at the &s;ame time warned, that if it was in|tended to u&s;e force and violence, the deci&s;ion might not be &s;o very &s;oon or &s;o very &s;ure; that the&s;e being a truly free people, and their government democratical, they would be
<PB N="04" REF="014439_0003_0F925DE59A4ACDF0">
able to arm every man in their country; that nece&s;&s;ity would, be&s;ides their Committees of Corre&s;pondence then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, teach them other means of moving and of acting together; that they would probably have at their head &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t and of the able&s;t men of their country; that the in|fluence of our Governors, and of our other civil officers would &s;hrink to nothing, nor our own authority probably extend farther than where it was enforced by our own troops; that our very &s;oldiery would de&s;ire and endeavour to leave us, and to go over to the Americans. Has one word of all this fallen to the ground, or is there almo&s;t a &s;ingle &s;entence of it which is not now become a matter of fact?</P>
<P>It was farther &s;et forth, that no immediate impre&s;&s;ions upon the town of Bo&s;ton, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion taken of it by a fleet or an army would carry the command of all that con|tinent, or force them to &s;ubmit to mea&s;ures &s;o univer&s;ally again&s;t their bent and inclinations, but that on the contra|ry, the mo&s;t &s;trenuous and mo&s;t vigorous exertions were from that whole people to be expected in &s;upport of their common liberties and properties. May I call on our Mi|ni&s;ters, and demand whether they are not them&s;elves &s;en|&s;ible by this time of all the&s;e things?</P>
<P>I will pa&s;s by other particulars of the &s;ame &s;ort, that I may not tire my reader with the repetition of them How|ever I hope, that the pre&s;umption will be pardoned, &s;hould it be a&s;ked, Whether there is any one event as yet come on, in the order of time and the cour&s;e of things, which has contradicted or happened otherwi&s;e than what was before pointed out? This gives a great prejudice and &s;u&s;picion with re&s;pect to the farther train remaining yet to follow. However there is behind, and among the things in &s;u&s;pence, one particular circum&s;tance of &s;uch a magnitude, that all the&s;e other incidents are, in compari&s;on of it, but as the du&s;t upon the balance. I mean, that &s;hould, by the&s;e mea|&s;ures, either the public expences increa&s;e, or income de|crea&s;e, or both together, &s;o that the national revenue &s;hall fail, and we be rendered unable to proceed in paying the whole intere&s;t of our debt, then will, in all appearance, be no longer delayed the day and the hour of our de&s;truction, but that conjuncture prove the late&s;t and the uttermo&s;t term of our peace, our pro&s;perity and our &s;tability, as a &s;tate and a nation. This point is much pre&s;&s;ed in the former &s;heets; however Heaven avert, that fate &s;hould in the due

order of things, and at &s;ome perhaps not very di&s;tant mo|ment of time, demon&s;trate it to be as well grounded, as have already been found &s;o many other cautions and warn|ings before given! But if we &s;ow the &s;eeds, it may be de|pended on that the fruits will follow; cau&s;es and effects keep their cour&s;e like day and night; events appear to be preparing and bringing on that period; men and things, coun&s;els and actions, &s;igns and appearances &s;eem to tend to that cata&s;trophe. However the writer pre&s;umes to offer once more to the public the mite of his &s;entiments upon the &s;tate of our affairs in America, as it &s;tands now altered &s;ince the date of the preceding pages; while we have yet allotted a time to do it, while there is room for reflection, and that any thing remains more for Britons than only to relate the &s;tory of their ruin.</P>
<P>This attack upon the continent appeared to many peo|ple mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing from the very beginning; futurity has neverthele&s;s before it a con&s;tant cloud and ob&s;curity, which no human eye can perfectly pe|netrate; ra&s;hne&s;s and incon&s;ideratene&s;s do &s;ometimes make this more of a pretence than the ca&s;e will well warrant; but however doubtful the matter might then be or not, time has now opened events, and fact and certainty have in many re&s;pects taken place on the &s;ubject. It is clear and &s;ure, that the propo&s;ed plan and project have failed and mi&s;carried. We &s;ent out, at fir&s;t, forces fit for our in|tended de&s;ign. The common language u&s;ed in commendation of the mea&s;ure was, that a few regiments and a few &s;mall &s;hips of war would do the bu&s;ine&s;s. But we are now call|ing and gathering together an army from all quarters, from England, from Ireland, from &s;everal different parts of America, and even our newly conquered province of Que|bec is to be unguarded and unfurni&s;hed, that we may be enabled to carry on a war again&s;t our ancient colonies, and our own countrymen. We have in&s;tead of command|ing and of bringing to taxation and to &s;ubjection all America, by the means of the town of Bo&s;ton, lo&s;t the re&s;t of that continent, and not gained the town. We have with our own hands, and by our own coun&s;els, got things into &s;uch a &s;tate; that our colonies obey their Governors no farther than they plea&s;e; and that they are unanimou&s;ly and publicly preparing to oppo&s;e mea&s;ure to mea&s;ure, or force to force, as they &s;hall upon the event judge mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary; while that b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">oque of New-England looks us in

the face upon an equality, and holds up its head as highly as we do our&s;elves. Matters are ten times more embroiled than they were; wear ten times a wor&s;e and a more threat|ning a&s;pect than they did &s;even months ago, and before that we entered on the&s;e mea&s;ures, every &s;tep taken for|wards, in our pre&s;ent track, &s;eems only to lead us into far|ther mi&s;chief and difficulties. Our admini&s;tration is, in the mean time, become the wonder and the contempt of all Europe. When we find therefore, that we are going on in a road directly wrong, why don't we take a contrary cour&s;e? This appears to be a mo&s;t obvious &s;tep; there is no uncom|mon reach of rea&s;on, or extraordinary depth of human wi&s;|dom demanded, to make that conclu&s;ion. It is an old pro|verb; that wi&s;e men do often, but fools never change their opinion. No one little or great need &s;cruple to alter for the better his actions or his mea&s;ures; it is &s;urely his fir&s;t prai&s;e and fir&s;t prudence &s;o to do. But what mu&s;t be thought of tho&s;e, whom facts and events them&s;elves will not convince; or, who being convinced, are neverthele&s;s determined to &s;trive and to contend again&s;t the irre&s;i&s;tible force of them? Our political pilots have a fair and a direct wind for the port, to which the commonwealth is bound; but they are ob&s;tinately bent to run counter to it, to buffet &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, to ri&s;que rocks and quick&s;ands, and to endanger in the greate&s;t degree the common adventure and fortunes of us all. We read a fabulous &s;tory of an ancient Roman &s;aid to have leaped into a gulph to &s;ave Rome; but what will po&s;terity believe, when they &s;hall be told of the men of the&s;e times, who run headlong down a precipice for no apparent end, but to carry along with them their coun|try into the &s;ame ruin?</P>
<P>The original de&s;ign and expectation were at lea&s;t &s;uffi|ciently plain and intelligible; but the admini&s;tration having been deceived in them, there is now no longer left the lea&s;t appearance of prudence or of policy in our proceedings. It is become difficult to comprehend, what the authors or the friends of the&s;e mea&s;ures pur&s;ue even in their own brea&s;ts. Let any one within the bounds of probability or almo&s;t of po&s;&s;ibility fancy in his mind, events at plea&s;ure, and let him reflect by what &s;teps, what means, what chain of incidents and accidents, what train within the wit of man to trace, it can be expected, that we &s;hall in this violent and military method of going on come to a good and advantageous con|clu&s;ion, and I believe, that he will evidently find him&s;elf
<PB N="07" REF="014439_0006_0F925DE7C254F838">
at a default on the &s;ubject. I am per&s;uaded, that our rulers would them&s;elves be put to it, to lay down fairly and clearly their own plan, nor is any &s;uch commonly known and un|der&s;tood. The facts are public, the other would, no doubt not be difficult to find, if rea&s;on, appearances, and proba|bility &s;ugge&s;ted or admitted of any &s;uch. The chaplains of our regiments are not to chop logick with the Americans, and to rea&s;on them into the being taxed at We&s;tmin&s;ter: That is not the intention, nor will hard words bring this about, from whence&s;oever trumpeted&mdash;No: We will force them to it&mdash;Be it &s;o. Let us, without con&s;idering the chance of war or re&s;i&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e Bo&s;ton in a&s;hes, no one &s;tone of it &s;tanding on another, the inhabitants, men, women and children buried under its ruins, and all this havock and de&s;truction the effect of our cannon, bombs and mortars. This would no doubt be a noble event; Europe would &s;tare, and it would exceedingly redound to the honor and the glory of the government that &s;hould atchieve it. However, let us come to the con&s;equences; the mi&s;chief and the evil are ea&s;ily found, rage and de&s;pair reigning every where, all our colonies crying out for vengeance, America in arms, and in open and avowed revolt again&s;t Great Bri|tain; the&s;e things need not to be pointed out. But how are butchery and ma&s;&s;acre to conduct us to peace, to a &s;ettle|ment, to a re&s;toration of union and of harmony, or to any de&s;ireable end what&s;oever? All regard for the Americans being bani&s;hed out of the que&s;tion, either as brethren or as men, it can neverthele&s;s not be pretended, that we ought likewi&s;e to lo&s;e &s;ight of the true intere&s;t and the benefit of our more immediate country of Great Britain, nor are we &s;urely to &s;eek for any other views or motives of our public coun&s;els on the occa&s;ion, than tho&s;e. God forbid, that there &s;hould in&s;tead prevail pa&s;&s;ion, re&s;entment, an impa|tience of oppo&s;ition and of di&s;appointment, a thir&s;t for re|venge and for the blood of the people of Bo&s;ton and of New-England: Heaven avert, that there &s;hould directly or indirectly, more nearly or more remotely, be at this moment preparing or meditating any de&s;perate &s;troke, which may disjoin America and Great Britain in a manner to be never united more! I will not deny, but that the que&s;tion re&s;pect|ing the plan of our conduct may with le&s;s difficulty be ex|plained, if &s;ome &s;uch unfit principles and con&s;iderations are to be taken into the account.</P>
<P><PB N="08" REF="014439_0007_0F925DE9AB2257D8">
But &s;ome one may &s;ay, What a &s;trange tragedy and image have here been introduced? Who thinks of any &s;uch thing? We would not for the world be the aggre&s;&s;ors; but if the people of Bo&s;ton or of New-England &s;hall begin fir&s;t, and &s;hall attack or unlawfully re&s;i&s;t us, you know, that the wrong will then be with them, and that all, which we &s;hall do, will be nothing but &s;elf-defence and the execution of the law, nor do we wage war but with men. I an&s;wer; that this is too high, too home and too &s;erious a &s;ubject, on which for any one to refu&s;e him&s;elf or to be readily refu&s;ed by others freedom of &s;peech. I pre&s;ume, that it is within the lawful liberty of an Engli&s;hman to demand, in return, to what end are then intended a military Governor, a fleet, an army, artillery, warlike provi&s;ion and ammunition and &s;upplies and reinforcements of the&s;e things, together with acts of Parliament, which, it was known, would not be obeyed? Are all the&s;e red coats and regiments mu&s;tered there only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the people of America in the clearing of their plantations, the reaping of their harve&s;ts, or the watch|ing of their flocks and their herds? Should any one &s;tart at the idea of Bo&s;ton being overthrown, what would he &s;ay, were he in plain Engli&s;h told, that there is no appearance or probability of carrying into execution &s;ome certain mea|&s;ures, without cutting the throats of almo&s;t all our Ame|rica, without dying its fore&s;ts, its &s;wamps and its &s;avan|nahs, with the blood of tho&s;e, who&s;e ance&s;tors fled from their country, and went thither in hopes of finding refuge from the tyranny and the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Governors of Great Britain? What does it matter, who dies a victim; the fir&s;t or the la&s;t, and whether by the &s;word, the mu&s;ket and the bayonet, or by famine, di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery, when a whole region &s;hall be laid wa&s;te and depopulated? Is it difficult to pick a quarrel on any &s;ubject, or to drive a people into de&s;pair and then to de&s;troy them for being de&s;|perate, or are there wanting writers or &s;peakers to defend any action or any mea&s;ure? But will the glo&s;&s;ing, the quib|bling, the flattery of pen&s;ioners or of &s;ycop ants heal the wounds, calm the minds, appea&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions, reconcile the affections, or blind and confound the under&s;tandings of an injured and exa&s;perated continent, con&s;i&s;ting of many numerous and flouri&s;hing provinces, and inhabited by a people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and in&s;pired with a love of liberty almo&s;t lo&s;t to the &s;hame of the human &s;pecies, out of Europe, but mo&s;t pwerful and irre&s;i&s;tible wherever it prevails and is
<PB N="09" REF="014439_0008_0F925DEAA836B168">
united with the means of defence? I do not mean to talk to Mini&s;ters and to State&s;men about right and wrong, hu|manity, compa&s;&s;ion and the cardinal virtues; but I repeat, that there is in the&s;e mea&s;ures full as little of the policy of Machiavel as of the morality of Grotius, or the religion of the Whole Duty of Man; not a whit more of the wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent than of the innocence of the dove.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of the nation is in the mean time mo&s;t &s;trong again&s;t the&s;e tran&s;actions; people were not at the beginning &s;o much moved; they appear not to have believed, that any men at the head of a &s;tate would really be &s;o wild and &s;o headlong, as to bring about in effect what now &s;tares them mo&s;t &s;trongly and mo&s;t fully in the face; it is well under&s;tood that the all of the public and of every private per&s;on is upon a de&s;perate ca&s;t, at &s;take again&s;t nothing; men rai&s;e their eyes and their hands with horror, when they &s;peak on the occa&s;ion; they &s;ympathi&s;e in common with the Americans, and expre&s;s plainly and roundly their own &s;entiments on their account; &s;uch are on the contrary &s;ilent and re&s;erved on the &s;ubject, who are u&s;ed to direct their di&s;cour&s;e by mean motives; the change or di&s;charge of the&s;e mea&s;ures would be a mo&s;t &s;incere and univer&s;al &s;a|tisfaction. Shall then a great nation, with its eyes open and &s;en&s;ible of its &s;ituation and its danger, be drawn or driven upon its ruin, by a few men among them, and tho&s;e perhaps intru&s;ted for its &s;afety and its protection? Where is in that ca&s;e the con&s;titution, or what is our pretended and our boa&s;ted repre&s;entation? Is there nothing, nothing even to the utmo&s;t extremity of our de&s;truction, but what corruption can compa&s;s, and pro&s;titution will perform? The&s;e proceedings are of that dangerous and de&s;tructive tendency, that whoever promotes or unites in them, does, as a private man, light a brand to fire his own hou&s;e, and to lay wa&s;te his own e&s;tate; but as one of the public he concurs with his own hand to thru&s;t a dagger into the heart of his already wounded, helple&s;s and almo&s;t expiring country. It may be wondered how any &s;uch per&s;on can hold up his hands towards heaven, to pray for pro&s;perity on him or his, which he does him&s;elf &s;o directly counter|act. Can then any nation, famous for its freedom, want in &s;uch an extremity &s;ome proper remedy and re&s;ource again&s;t the rage, the madne&s;s, or the incapacity of an admini|&s;tration?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014439_0009_0F925DEC92C1D588">
I an&s;wer, that our ance&s;tors were far from being &s;o care|le&s;s of tho&s;e to come after them, as to have left us in con|cerns depending on our own dome&s;tic government without means very &s;ufficient for our &s;afety and our welfare. The people of Great-Britain have a lawful, con&s;titutional, ac|knowledged, undi&s;puted, undoubted power of application and petition. This is an inherent right of every county, every city, every borough, every body of men in it, and which any one may be confident, that no King, no Mini|&s;ter, and, let me add, no Parliament will re&s;i&s;t or with|&s;tand; if the exertion of it &s;hall be general, univer&s;al and unanimous, &s;uch as &s;hall evidently &s;peak with the full and the clear voice of the whole nation, it may in &s;uch a ca&s;e be depended upon for &s;ufficient and effectual. Never did perhaps any period of our hi&s;tory more require &s;uch an ex|ertion than the pre&s;ent moment. I will not repeat what has been &s;aid with re&s;pect to the &s;take, either of the public or of private per&s;ons; but even the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t, in all appearance, be in his own brea&s;t plea&s;ed with it. It might afford him a fair opportunity, or almo&s;t force him, to with|draw his foot out of difficulties; in which he cannot but by this time be &s;en&s;ible how ra&s;hly and incon&s;iderately he has involved both him&s;elf and his country. What unac|countable fatality is it, which can prevent any one at the helm of a nation from taking of his own accord &s;o prudent and &s;o &s;alutary a &s;tep. But this matter mounts higher. The King is ble&s;&s;ed with a fair and a large family, from whom even a private parent might promi&s;e him&s;elf the greate&s;t comfort and felicity, but much more may his Ma|je&s;ty, if they near him &s;hall by their fatal and unfortunate coun&s;els mingle no bitter in his cup. However let all loyal &s;ubjects well reflect, and e&s;pecially they fir&s;t in favour, whether the&s;e mea&s;ures are not of &s;uch a magnitude and a malignity, that they may either immediately or in their con&s;equences throw the whole &s;tate into the la&s;t confu&s;ion, endanger our becoming a prey to foreign powers, &s;hake the throne it&s;elf, and di&s;turb one day the peace and the happine&s;s of our gracious Prince, even within his own pa|lace, and in the mid&s;t of his numerous royal progeny. To whom&s;oever we may therefore pre&s;ume on this &s;ubject to offer up our humble petitions, we &s;hall be&s;eech tho&s;e re|&s;pectable pers&s;ons to ble&s;s and to &s;ecure equally both the public and them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="014439_0010_0F925DECF5A0F930">
It &s;eems the more nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e this la&s;t &s;afe re&s;ource of the con&s;titution, as it is difficult to find any other help, that is left for us under heaven. Our political parties and their leaders bear a &s;u&s;picion of covering and concealing, under pretences of the general good de&s;igns of per&s;onal ambition and advancement. The people of England have had but too much experience in that re&s;pect. What divi|&s;ion, what connection, what denomination of men among us have not in their turn &s;poiled and plundered this poor country? Our liberties and our properties were before the Revolution attacked, under the pretence of prerogative, by a &s;et of men who bore the name, and who invented or ad|vanced the doctrine of Tories; but the virtue of our an|ce&s;tors &s;aved us then. Through how long a &s;eries of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive admini&s;trations has &s;ince that time this nation been &s;old, bartered and betrayed by a race of fal&s;e, pretended, unworthy and venal Whigs; who&s;e endeavours towards our de&s;truction have unfortunately been more &s;ucce&s;sful than tho&s;e of their predece&s;&s;ors? God forbid, that we &s;hould now be ready to receive our fatal and our final &s;troke from the joint force of both the&s;e cau&s;es, from the accur&s;ed prac|tice of corruption, united with the &s;en&s;ele&s;s principles of a boundle&s;s obedience of the people, and of an extravagant power of the crown! The&s;e evils do not perhaps lea&s;t pre|vail in the very places, which ought mo&s;t to be a &s;anctuary and a &s;ecurity again&s;t them. What is become of the an|cient public &s;pirit of England, when the fir&s;t in rank and in fortune were ever the foremo&s;t to protect the rights of the whole? It is for the honor of our name and our nation to be hoped, that this noble pa&s;&s;ion of the human brea&s;t is retired, and is &s;etting up its &s;tandard among our country|men on the continent, if it has totally fled from this once free and fortunate i&s;land. It mu&s;t grieve any one to a&s;k, Whether there are none, even in the re&s;pected band of our profe&s;&s;ed patriots, who had it once in their power to have utterly extingui&s;hed, but who left unhappily and purpo&s;ely to lurk and to &s;mother in their proceedings and in their own acts of parliament this very preten&s;ion, and, as it were, the &s;ame fire, which has &s;ince broken out &s;o fiercely, and which threatens now to con&s;ume in one common flame both Britain and America? However, it is to be hoped that the&s;e per&s;ons will, from &s;uch violent and &s;uch evident mi&s;chiefs, be at length convinced, nor continue backward to concur and to contribute towards &s;ome &s;ufficient mea&s;ures for the

la&s;ting peace and relief of our country and our colonies. But we are now upon the brink of the precipice; our &s;itu|ation admits no longer of our being led blindfold; it is too late for us to tru&s;t either to thorough-paced mini&s;ters or to half-paced patriots; the time requires this nation to de|clare its own genuine &s;en&s;e, perhaps its la&s;t &s;en&s;e of its condition and its circum&s;tances. How can we otherwi&s;e expect in this ca&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of providence it&s;elf than in employing the powers, which his goodne&s;s has, by the means of the con&s;titution and the provi&s;ion of our ance&s;tors, been plea&s;ed to lodge with us for that apparent purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, have not we a legal repre&s;entative, and is not that &s;ufficient? I &s;hall leave the matter of fact to an&s;wer with re&s;pect to the &s;ufficiency, but I de&s;ire to &s;ay &s;omething in explanation of the point it&s;elf. I hope to be perfectly under&s;tood, that I do not at all mean to deny our having &s;uch a legal repre&s;entative; but it is &s;urely ju&s;t and becoming for us to di&s;cour&s;e on &s;ubjects of this con&s;equence with one another, like men. I pre&s;ume, that it is per|mitted for any one to a&s;k, whether there is not &s;ome di&s;|tinction between a legal repre&s;entative and a real one. All bodies of men &s;peak and act by their majority. It is a handful of people in compari&s;on of the whole nation, which choo&s;e the major part of our Hou&s;e of Commons. I may in &s;aying this expre&s;s my&s;elf freely, but I offend no worthy or hone&s;t man. No &s;uch will ever take offence at a noto|rious truth, and none can well be more &s;o than the fact, which is now mentioned. How can then, in the common u&s;e and &s;en&s;e of the Engli&s;h language, any body of men really repre&s;ent any others, than tho&s;e by whom the greater part of them are named and appointed for that purpo&s;e? This may not interfere with a legal repre&s;entation, nor do I declare my&s;elf any opinion about a real one. I am on the &s;ubject ready to receive with re&s;pect the dictates of my bet|ters. It may perhaps be a my&s;tery in politics, or &s;omething not at this moment comprehended by the writer. How|ever this legal, this real repre&s;entative, or in what manner &s;oever that honorable body is to be de&s;cribed, they do ever &s;uffer their fellow-&s;ubjects to apply to them by petition, through the hands of any one of their own members. This circum&s;tance is there nece&s;&s;ary, but it &s;eems to make no effectual difference. The right or practice it&s;elf has never been denied or di&s;puted, nor therefore has it &s;tood in need of the &s;anction of an act of parliament. The road is yet
<PB N="13" REF="014439_0012_0F925DF2634D3370">
more direct to the throne; the &s;ubject pre&s;ents of him&s;elf, and without intervention, his petition there. This right was at the Revolution confirmed in as fit terms as the true&s;t frind of the freedom of his country could have found. There are therefore required no &s;trings or belts to clear either of the&s;e ways; they remain ever plain and open, and lead immediately to tho&s;e who can afford us effectual redre&s;s and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus &s;tands then this point: Our throne is he|reditary, our peerage is hereditary, the major part of our Hou&s;e of Commons is appointed by an incon&s;iderable pro|portion of the nation; can then many words be wanted to recommend or to enforce the practice of petition by the people and the public, or is the community to have no &s;hare in its own co&s;titution, in its legi&s;lature, its government, and the determination of its mo&s;t important and mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential concerns?</P>
<P>However, as we have in our hands proper, prudent, and peaceable means of &s;topping or of diverting the&s;e mea|&s;ures, &s;o let us on the other &s;ide con&s;ider; whether we &s;hall not by a neglect of them become partakers in the guilt of the wrongs done to the Americans, and of the ruin brought on our&s;elves and our po&s;terity. All people are re&s;pon&s;ible for the public conduct of tho&s;e, whom they appoint or con|&s;ent to be over them; this is the law of men and of na|tions, but it is likewi&s;e that of a higher power; it is the law of nature. I ob&s;erve with reverence, that providence &s;eems to unite together the intere&s;ts and concerns, the fate and fortunes of each &s;tate and of each kingdom, and to de|mand at their hands an account of the actions of their re|&s;pective rulers, whether princes, mini&s;ters, or any other; their pro&s;perity and their adver&s;ity appear to be in a great degree dealt out to them according to that circum&s;tance. It is &s;trange, on what ground &s;ome people found their pre|&s;umption; for the public does not only appoint govern|ment in its fir&s;t original; but it is mo&s;t evident, that it does afterwards continue at all times to an&s;wer for the con|duct and the mea&s;ures of its governors both to God and to man. But with re&s;pect to our own ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, can there be in the affairs of humanity a fairer or a more equitable condition than for people to have in their own power the means of removing their danger, and of &s;e|curing their &s;tability? However it behoves us to remember on what terms we enjoy it. The Americans may one day require at our hands, and retaliate upon us their own &s;uf|ferings,
<PB N="14" REF="014439_0013_0F925DF517193D10">
and mo&s;t certainly will do &s;o, if we &s;hall not exert to effect the&s;e means inherent in us, but that the things and the events already begun and in motion &s;hall come to extremity. The &s;tory of the war carried on by the Dutch in &s;upport of their liberty, again&s;t the Portugue&s;e and the Spaniards, will &s;ufficiently teach us this; if we need to go beyond our own rea&s;on for &s;uch a piece of in&s;truction. We have in our&s;elves, and placed in our hands, the power on this occa&s;ion of in&s;uring our own &s;afety, and of re&s;toring to our colonies and our countrymen of America their rights, their peace, their properties, and their liberties, a mo&s;t noble and ine&s;timable privilege, but in all appearance not en|tru&s;ted to us without account.</P>
<P>It may however be a&s;ked, what way is then to be taken, what clue can be found, that may lead us out of our pre|&s;ent perplexity and difficulties? I an&s;wer, that it is much more ea&s;y to embroil a &s;tate, which is in peace and in tran|quillity, than it is to reduce it again to the &s;ame de&s;irable &s;ituation, when it &s;hall once be &s;o embroiled. However I will in &s;o important a matter venture to hazard an opinion, although with &s;ome uncertainty of the future fact whereon it is grounded. There is &s;aid to be &s;itting, at Philadelphia, a Congre&s;s of &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons of that continent. It appears probable, that there may from them come in &s;ome &s;hape or another propo&s;itions to the public or to the government. Should that be &s;o, let not the&s;e be out of an ill-judged pride or idea of &s;uperiority de&s;pi&s;ed and refu&s;ed, but on the contrary adopted and made the ground and the foundation of a future &s;ettlement and e&s;ta|bli&s;hment between us and America: I won't prevaricate or deny that, I mean in &s;ome mea&s;ure a new one; for of re|turning again exactly and preci&s;ely to the former and an|cient one, there is not the lea&s;t appearance of probability; although there &s;hall in the way be nothing more than what is known to have already happened. They have once tru&s;ted to our experience and our prudence; however they have found the&s;e but a weak and a &s;lender &s;ecurity. They will undoubtedly expect &s;ome &s;tronger and better barrier, &s;ome line to be drawn, or &s;ome land-mark to be fixed, in fu|turity between us. I &s;peak it with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity; that I verily believe them to under&s;tand the joint intere&s;ts of Great-Britain and of America better than we do, and that they will in the fir&s;t in&s;tance propo&s;e nothing unfit or un|becoming with re&s;pect to this country; but &s;hould we ne|glect
<PB N="15" REF="014439_0014_0F925DF54DD89DE0">
or reject proper terms, when they are offered, we may perhaps afterwards not come readily to the &s;ame again. On Charles the fir&s;t granted ten times more at la&s;t, than would have contented and have &s;atisfied at fir&s;t; but he ever &s;uffered him&s;elf to be forced; that was his evil policy and evil fortune. None thanked him for what he did. He lo&s;t at length all, his head not excepted. Do not let our &s;tate or our government imitate in their conduct that unfortunate prince. There may directly be for a kingdom no block or &s;caffold; but there are ju&s;t and equal laws, and a &s;evere and irre&s;i&s;tible fatality attending upon the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of them. What is in the general cour&s;e of an in|finite univer&s;e, perpetually proceeding in obedience to tho&s;e laws, the exi&s;tence, the ri&s;e, or the fall of a &s;tate, any more upon the compari&s;on than that of a &s;ingle per&s;on? The&s;e are not light and trifling matters, which are now in ope|ration, a mid&s;ummer night's dream, or the &s;tory of a day; with which we may divert our&s;elves at our will. It may be depended upon; that it is for ever, if the&s;e provinces &s;hall once be &s;evered from us. The command and the go|vernment of great countries are not to be taken up again at plea&s;ure, when they &s;hall have fallen from the hand that holds them, like the playthings of children.</P>
<P>But it may be ob&s;erved to have been thrown out, that France and Spain would interfere; whereas nothing of that kind has happened, nor are we di&s;turbed by either of them. I an&s;wer, that their mini&s;ters of &s;tate mu&s;t other|wi&s;e have been much as thoughtle&s;s and as incon&s;iderate as our own. It is fit, that the fi&s;h &s;hould fa&s;ten on the hook or be entangled in the net, beyond the power of get|ting free, before the hand appears which is to &s;trike or to make a prey of it. He is &s;urely but a poor politician, who can be laid a&s;leep by tho&s;e two cabinets, being more cunning than to &s;tay or to turn us in the beginning of a career, which mu&s;t be &s;o much to their &s;atisfaction and their incli|nation. It is an old proverb, that any one &s;hould make a bridge of gold for his enemy when he is flying from him. Is it to be doubted, but that the&s;e powers would willingly pave, almo&s;t with any materials and at any expence, a way for us to march and to attack our own provinces; tho&s;e provinces which have &s;o long been the &s;upport of our&s;elves, and the envy of other nations. It has been &s;aid, that they have before now found the means of paving the way to their own peace with us; but heaven forbid that they &s;hould ever
<PB N="16" REF="014439_0015_0F925DF607B5F020">
find that of putting us at daggers-draw among our&s;elves, of engaging in a war with one another the mother country and our colonies of North-America! Whenever that ill|&s;tarred hour &s;hall arrive, and by who&s;e folly or artifice &s;o|ever brought about, the arms of our rivals will hardly he wanted to lay the glory and the greatne&s;s of Britain in the du&s;t. France and Spain laugh and &s;ing in the mean time to &s;ee what we are doing, and it may be depended upon, that they know better than to meddle at this moment in our broils.</P>
<P>There is another point, to which I would &s;peak a word, before I have done. Some &s;ycophants and makers of mi&s;|chief on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic &s;eem to have had no &s;mall part in cau&s;ing the pre&s;ent di&s;turbances. Why &s;hould otherwi&s;e all the&s;e have rather ari&s;en in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay than in Connecticut or in Rhode-I&s;land; except that we appoint the Governors in the former, and that the people them&s;elves do &s;o in the latter. The coun&s;els of the&s;e men mu&s;t, upon experience, have been found wrong and mi&s;|taken. They magnified the mighty power of parliaments, and appear to have flattered &s;ome people here, as if their &s;inger was irre&s;i&s;tible. Had they pointed out events, as they have really happened; it is impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould have conducted our&s;elves as we have actually done. All this may clearly be accounted for, if we &s;uppo&s;e one prin|ciple, which is that they meant to advance them&s;elves in Great-Britain, however their endeavours might turn out either for us or for America. It would be a mo&s;t &s;trange thing, &s;hould the&s;e &s;ame per&s;ons be &s;till con&s;ulted, coun|tenanced and encouraged. We ought to be &s;en&s;ible how clearly we have already paid on that article. The writer does not know the face of one of them; I &s;peak &s;ingly for the &s;ake of the public; but there can in all appearance no common good come to the two countries of Great-Britain and of North America, until that the&s;e fatal authors of our mutual evils &s;hall be bani&s;hed from all coun&s;els and confidence.</P>
<P>So much for my pre&s;ent object. I have on this occa&s;ion not entered into the difficulty, or rather the apparent im|po&s;&s;ibility, of &s;ubduing with a few thou&s;ands of &s;oldiers from England a very great continent, mo&s;t &s;trong in it&s;elf, and defended by &s;ome hundreds of thou&s;ands of its inhabi|tants naturally placed over the different parts, and com|manding all the produce and the advantages of the country,
<PB N="17" REF="014439_0016_0F925DF6B9A32468">
and who are armed, trained and ready to take the field in defence of what they believe to be their all; men of tried bravery, and that have upon experience performed many actions of remark. I have not in&s;i&s;ted on the ab&s;olute cer|tainty of their finding, in ca&s;e of a direct rupture and revolt from Great-Britain, foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I have not men|tioned our mini&s;ters having wantonly, and in all appear|ance out of per&s;onal ambition, taken upon them&s;elves the affairs of our Ea&s;t-India Company, and having by that means &s;ubjected on any contention with the native powers of tho&s;e regions, the nation to the danger of being one day found between the two fires of the We&s;t-Indies and the Ea&s;t, and perhaps at the &s;ame time a fire in Europe hotter than either of the others. I have not examined the burthen of our national debt pre&s;&s;ing in the mid&s;t of the&s;e circum&s;tances mo&s;t heavily upon us. I have not touched on very many other topicks re&s;pecting our pre&s;ent ill-judged and ill-omened attempt; the&s;e were of a preceding &s;ubject. This matter has now been only taken up on the ground where it was left upon a former argument, and upon our mea&s;ures and the change and the &s;tate of affairs in America &s;ince that time; here will I likewi&s;e leave it once more.</P>
<P>It is not owing to a want of information, to a want of un|der&s;tanding, to a want of a &s;en&s;e and a knowledge of the importance or the imprudence of our American mea&s;ures, if &s;ome people of property, of capacity, of independence &s;eem to &s;leep &s;upinely, while a rock is ready to fall and to cru&s;h their country. There is in public concerns an ab|jectne&s;s, which obtains and daily increa&s;es among us, and that in a rank of men where it ought lea&s;t to prevail, and to whom others are intitled to look up in a time of danger or of difficulty. The ri&s;e and the beginning of this might readily be pointed out, it was not fir&s;t in this reign; but the&s;e men may truly be told, that there is no &s;upport for them&s;elves, but in the &s;tability of all; that their private fortune and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions will in the common de&s;truc|tion mo&s;t inevitably go to wreck and to ruin with the re&s;t; the cloud from the Atlantic threatens them, as well as the merchant and the manufacturer, the farmer and the labourer. But we &s;eem not to remember, that we are born Britons; that governments are in&s;tituted for the good of the governed, and for that only; that we have in our immediate, per&s;o|nal and collective capacity an inherent right to &s;ignify our &s;entiments of the national mea&s;ures to tho&s;e who contrive, govern and direct them; that the concern therein of many
<PB N="18" REF="014439_0017_0F925DF8AC1CA9E0">
is upon the compari&s;on much as con&s;iderable one for one as their own, but that of all united and taken together almo&s;t at the ocean to a drop of water; that we are men and not a &s;tock of &s;heep forced to follow our fellow, becau&s;e be hap|pens to bear a bell about his neck. The writer has thrown out the&s;e things from a &s;incere and earne&s;t de&s;ire of the ge|neral &s;afety and welfare; he heartily hopes that the &s;eed is &s;own in good ground, and that it will bear fruit for the benefit of the whole; but if, after all, the hand of fate is upon this nation; if the period approaches in which we are doomed to peri&s;h; if there is at once an incurable madne&s;s in our councils, and a boundle&s;s ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s in our proper guardians and protectors; if the con&s;titution is for|gotten, and men of weight and of re&s;pect abandon their country; I mu&s;t &s;ay, that his will be done, who governs both individuals and communities. I tru&s;t neverthele&s;s, that the&s;e words will not be &s;o lo&s;t, but that they &s;hall at lea&s;t pre&s;erve one private per&s;on from the charge and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having &s;crupled to &s;peak plainly his opi|nion, and his expectation of the dangers and the evils im|pending over the public.</P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> During the printing of the&s;e &s;heets, authentic ac|counts are come of re&s;olutions, re&s;pecting a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of commerce between America and Great-Britain being en|tered into, and recommended by the Congre&s;s held at Phi|ladelphia. This is another material circum&s;tance and con|&s;ideration, pointed out and pre&s;&s;ed in the foregoing book. I mean now to make no reflections on the &s;ubject; time will tell, whether the con&s;equences &s;hall al&s;o be &s;uch as are there &s;uppo&s;ed or conceived.

of the late acts of parliament, and if the &s;ame &s;hould be attempted to be carried into execution by force, all America ought in &s;uch a ca&s;e to &s;upport them in their oppo&s;ition.</Q> This neither needs nor admits of any comment; but how amply does it fulfil what we were on that head forewarned! However, let us at lea&s;t not neglect the caution which it contains, for the time to come. It is likewi&s;e almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for an Engli&s;hman not to ob|&s;erve, with the mo&s;t &s;incere regret, that the fir&s;t proceed|ings of a new and an e&s;&s;ential a&s;&s;embly among our&s;elves have been &s;uch, as mu&s;t by all men in our America be un|der&s;tood to approve and to maintain, in the highe&s;t and the har&s;he&s;t of language, the mea&s;ures carrying on again&s;t them.
