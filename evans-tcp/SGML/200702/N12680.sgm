<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the fir&s;t publication of the late Earl of Che&s;terfield's Letters, to the pre&s;ent time, the arrows of Cen&s;ure have been levelled at the doctrine they inculcate, from every quarter: the wit hath had his joke, the ver&s;ifier his parody, the morali&s;t his oppo&s;ing &s;entiment, and the divine his grave di&s;&s;ertation. Very ingenious men have taken the pen in hand to confront his Lord&s;hip: his Graces have been &s;martly ridiculed; his etiquette humorou&s;ly expo&s;ed; and Mr. Hunter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of &s;ome much admired Remarks on Lord Boling|broke's po&s;thumous Writings.</NOTE> with an elegance and pro|fundity far beyond the re&s;t of his remarkers, hath penetrated into the very bottom of his maxims, traver&s;ed him through every double, and examined his whole &s;y&s;tem with an analy|tical acutene&s;s.</P>
<P>It is matter of real amazement that among&s;t all tho&s;e who have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves loudly and diametrically again&s;t the doctrine of Lord Che&s;terfield's corre&s;pondence, none &s;hould have yet thought of the only method that was mo&s;t likely to manife&s;t their tendency. The general &s;tigma upon the&s;e Letters has been, that they are calculated to recommend deceit, and to con|ceal
<PB N="4" REF="016020_0004_0F9B25593906D4C8">
the mo&s;t de&s;tructive hypocri&s;y, under the &s;miling a&s;pect, plau&s;ible exterior, fair-&s;eeming &s;entiments, and a complacent flexibility.</P>
<P>In an age of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, it is mo&s;t obvious to apprehen&s;ion, that maxims, like the&s;e, would have mo&s;t weight with the young and di&s;&s;ipated. The man of fa&s;hion would find them &s;o con|&s;i&s;tent with his plan of &s;ecurity, that there would be little doubt but he would adopt them; and the man of expedient and broken fortunes would as eagerly catch at a mode of conduct which, without either danger of his neck, or character, might repair his pur&s;e, promote his plea&s;ures, and &s;ave him from a thou&s;and &s;hocks that poverty is heir to.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ence of my Lord Che&s;terfield's &s;y&s;tem &s;eems to be neither more nor le&s;s than this: Secure your&s;elf from being bla&s;ted, as he terms it, and do whatever you think proper; what|ever fancy, pa&s;&s;ion, whim, or wickedne&s;s, &s;ug|ge&s;t, only command your countenance, check your temper, and throw before your heart and bo&s;om the &s;hield of Di&s;&s;imulation, and &s;natch it&mdash;&s;eize it&mdash;enjoy it.</P>
<P>In regard to women&mdash;never &s;urely i&s;&s;ued from the pre&s;s a collection of hints &s;o capable of being turned to their de&s;truction: and the
<PB N="5" REF="016020_0005_0F9B2559F8B9CA20">
&s;ex ought to be more alarmed at this publication (which, however, one of their own &s;ex has u&s;hered into the world) than at any thing that ever was pointed at their peace of mind, or purity of character.</P>
<P>How, then, hath it happened, that no per&s;on hath yet put the volumes of the Earl of Che&s;|terfield into the hand of a hero, who, with a natural aptitude to enjoy every thing within his ob&s;ervation, might increa&s;e his felicity very con&s;iderably, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;entiments &s;o admirably &s;uited to multiply mi&s;chief, and to en&s;ure his victory over that &s;implicity, that beauty, and that &s;oftne&s;s, which would, thence, be, &s;o much the more ea&s;ily, <HI>thrown off their guard.</HI></P>
<P>As nothing of this kind, however, has ap|peared, I have ventured to pre&s;ent to the public, the adventures of a man of birth, rank, figure, and character, ardent in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ures, and much delighted <HI>with,</HI> and attracted <HI>by,</HI> the theory of Lord Che&s;terfield. He purcha&s;es the books, finds them agreeable to his palate, &s;tu|dies them paragraph by paragraph, thrives un|der his application, piques him&s;elf upon his progre&s;s; and in the end, a ma&s;ter of his &s;cience, invokes the genius of his noble preceptor, puts
<PB N="6" REF="016020_0006_0F9B255AC040A6C8">
money in his pur&s;e, the ine&s;timable volumes in his portmanteau, and &s;allies into the gay world, armed at all points, the PUPIL OF PLEASURE.</P>
<P>Every ingenious precept laid down by the noble Lord, this high-bred young gentleman reduces to practice, who, taking the &s;ummer before him, makes his attacks at a place of fa|&s;hionable re&s;ort; where (fixing with commend|able and pre-in&s;tructed acutene&s;s upon proper objects) he begins to exemplify, and is as &s;uc|ce&s;sful as the polite&s;t ca&s;ui&s;t could po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this hi&s;torical illu&s;tration&mdash;this biographical commentary on the text of Che&s;terfield&mdash;ample &s;cope has been allowed for the di&s;play of various characters, and particu|larly &s;uch as more immediately promoted the main de&s;ign of the work, which is, to &s;hew the aggravated evils in &s;ociety ari&s;ing from the practice of &s;uch <HI>perniciou&s;ly-plea&s;ing precepts.</HI></P>
<P>To this end, I have made great u&s;e of the noble Lord's maxims, rules, and admonitions, upon various &s;ubjects. The incidents, it is conceived, ari&s;e, naturally, out of the principles that produce them; the contra&s;t in the cha|racters, e&s;pecially of HOMESPUN, SEDLEY, THORNTON, Lieutenant VERNON, and Sir HENRY DELMORT, I have endeavoured to
<PB N="7" REF="016020_0007_0F9B255B7A7CF238">
render eminent and con&s;picuous; and although, &s;ome may think the cata&s;trophe, and a few of the circum&s;tances, carried too far into the pa|thetic, yet, I am per&s;uaded, tho&s;e who weigh deeply the <HI>precepts</HI> of Lord Che&s;terfield will agree with me in thinking, that, if pu&s;hed into <HI>practice</HI> by an adventurer, like that which his Lord&s;hip <HI>would</HI> have formed out of Mr. Stan|hope, &s;imilar or even greater &s;orrows, and vices, would invade the community. In &s;hort, this hi&s;tory is calculated &s;trongly to prove the truth of Lord Che&s;terfield's <HI>own</HI> ob&s;ervation, namely, "That the adoption of vice is likely to ruin ten times more young men, than natural in|clination."</P>

<P>THE whirl of wheels, a fine flow of &s;pirits, the ely&s;ium of expectation, and the vi|gour of fre&s;h hor&s;es at ever &s;tage, brought me, in le&s;s than twenty hours, from Cavendi&s;h|&s;quare to the place of date. Having no unne|ce&s;&s;ary luggage to retard me, no trifling petit|maitre, who, at two miles di&s;tance from the &s;hifting place, drives back for his gloves, his cane, his &s;nuff-box, or his white handkerchief; I rolled, THORNTON, on the &s;prings of expe|dition; and I &s;it down, un&s;ubdued by fatigue, to tell thee of my &s;afety.</P>

that wonder was re&s;erved to adorn the age before us.</P>
<P>Oh, CHESTERFIELD! CHESTERFIELD! THOU, only thou, knewe&s;t the <HI>&s;cience</HI> of joy; thou only had&s;t the &s;kill to cover the rugged|ne&s;&s;es of life with ro&s;es, that bloom from being pre&s;&s;ed. Deign then, immortal &s;hade! To look with a gentle eye upon THY PUPIL; teach me emulate thy genius, to practi&s;e thy precepts, to hit, with a felicity like thine, the true &s;pirit of di&s;&s;imulation&mdash;&s;often my features to the blandi&s;hments of delight&mdash;attune my tongue to the thrillings of per&s;ua&s;ion&mdash;enrich my &s;enti|ments with &s;o ver&s;atile a ductility, that I may obey the occa&s;ions of the minute&mdash;endue me with per&s;everance of &s;oul, and conde&s;cend to guide me (with all thy attendant graces, a&s;&s;idu|ities, and elegant attentions,) into the bo&s;om of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, my Friend, my Mentor, my Genius, and my God!</P>
<P>THORNTON, I am in&s;pired! The rhap&s;ody of my invocation is throbbing already at my heart&mdash;it is working its way to the very marrow in the bones. The divine Letters of OUR EARL are this in&s;tant brought in by the po&s;tilion, who is uncon&s;cious of the trea&s;ure, with which he is freighted. But &s;oft! I dare not proceed till

<HEAD>LETTER III. SEDLEY to THORNTON.</HEAD>
<P>DULL THORNTON!&mdash;circum&s;pect citizen! at what art thou alarmed, and "wherefore is thy &s;pirit troubled within thee?" How can&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="016020_0011_0F9B255E7991D6B8">
thou entertain &s;o contemptible a notion of thy SEDLEY? <HI>Imitation!</HI> Cur&s;e thee for the thought. Ha&s;t thou&mdash;illiberal a&s;per&s;er&mdash;ha&s;t thou, in the cour&s;e of &s;even enterprizing years, ever known me deign to &s;toop from the ori|ginality of <HI>&s;elf</HI> to the &s;lavery of another? 'Tis true, I admire the Lord of CHESTERFIELD: his epi&s;tles are, in the reading hour, always in my hand; they repo&s;e at night behind my pillow, and they at pre&s;ent con&s;titute my tra|velling library. But I &s;corn to be fettered, either in body or &s;oul, Imitation indeed! Let me echo the dictates of my rage&mdash;cur&s;e thee for the thought! The liberty of the <HI>under|&s;tanding</HI> is as dear to me, as the liberty of the <HI>per&s;on;</HI> and I have too much pride, too much dignity, to become a plagiary. THORNTON, no; the Earl is, as it were, my tutor; his &s;en|timents are &s;uch, as I have long <HI>felt,</HI> but &s;uch as, till now, I was cautious to <HI>avow.</HI> The idle modes of the world &s;tood as a bar, betwixt the precept and the practice. Hitherto, I have been re&s;trained in my actions, and lo&s;t half the joy of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, no|body had either reputation, ingenuity, or ta&s;te enough to keep me in countenance. I &s;wam the common current of plea&s;ure, but was al|ways afraid of going out of my depth. The
<PB N="13" REF="016020_0012_0F9B255F393A48A8">
herd are contented to be libertines in the ordi|nary, &s;hallow, &s;hadowy way, and, before the appearance of the&s;e <HI>enchanting Letters,</HI> which, like the &s;un, broke out upon our gro&s;sne&s;s, we wanted the imprimatur of a man of celebrity,&mdash;of &s;uch a &s;oul as Che&s;terfield's, to give credit and eclat to the efforts of an enterprizing &s;pirit. But <HI>now</HI> the impediment is removed,&mdash;the avenue is opened,&mdash;the ice that cu&s;tom had frozen about the heart is thawed, and the pro&s;|pect of plea&s;ure is palpable. The repo&s;itory of STANHOPE, the cabinet of CHESTERFIELD, the Earl's arcanum, are all di&s;clo&s;ed:&mdash;EUGENIA&mdash;bear, bear the name, ye ro&s;y|wing'd deities of joy, in gratitude to heaven!&mdash;EUGENIA has given to mankind the invaluable remains of her father,&mdash;remains which&mdash;(Oh, THORNTON, echo EUGENIA!)&mdash;have di&s;co|vered, to every elegant character, fle&s;h roads to the temple of felicity; virgin re&s;ources of per|&s;onal extacy; and trea&s;uries of bli&s;s as yet un|ta&s;ted, and unexplored.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign then, is to indulge my principles, by improving upon tho&s;e maxims which his poli&s;h'd pen hath made <HI>fa&s;hionable.</HI> Let duller &s;ouls content them&s;elves with <HI>vulgar</HI> happine&s;s; with yielding beauty, entrapt &s;implicity, and
<PB N="14" REF="016020_0013_0F9B255FFB3BBA10">
the mere defloration of female youth.&mdash;I can|not be circum&s;cribed by &s;uch common, <HI>animal</HI> &s;en&s;ations: no, James!&mdash;give me delicacy, difficulty, refinement,&mdash;give me innovation,&mdash;or take from me exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>"To beat the beaten track,&mdash;to ta&s;te the ta&s;ted."&mdash;Oh, &s;hocking!&mdash;in&s;upportable! I am above it. I &s;corn it.</P>
<P>In a word then, THORNTON, what our GARRICK is to SHAKESPEARE, I am re&s;olved to be to CHESTERFIELD,&mdash;the living com|ment, upon the dead text. The youth to whom the Earl's Letters were originally ad|dre&s;&s;ed, thou knowe&s;t, is dead; and he wanted a <HI>&s;oul</HI> to reli&s;h, and a ta&s;te to improve, had he continued among&s;t us. Such a cool creature is better in its coffin. Peace to his uncongenial manes! But &s;hall STANHOPE be therefore without an heir? No,&mdash;I claim the inheritance, THORNTON, and de&s;ire you will henceforth con&s;ider <HI>me</HI> as his &s;on, by the adoption of his <HI>&s;entiment.</HI> Nay, had the&s;e veins been filled with the rich &s;tream that fed the heart of STANHOPE, I could not have been more like him&s;elf&mdash;God forgive me! but, were it not &s;aid, and &s;aid &s;olemnly, that my mother was the Diana of her day, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect &s;he played

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. From the Reverend HORACE HOMESPUN to Doctor DIGGORY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU remember, I pre&s;ume, the jaunt I took in the la&s;t year to SOUTHAMPTON, the particulars of which, at the reque&s;t of &s;ome friends, I &s;uffered to be printed in the WEST|MINSTER MAGAZINE, in two &s;everal letters addre&s;&s;ed to the publi&s;her, Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT, of E&s;&s;ex-&s;treet, in the Strand, Lon|don. I there told you, that I was not quite &s;o highly intere&s;ted in, or entertained by, the &s;cenes in a hurry before me, as my <HI>then</HI> patron, the Baronet, would flatter my imagination with upon the road; and (as I find tho&s;e letters from the We&s;tmin&s;ter Magazine were reprinted into various <HI>other</HI> monthly publications) I have rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e my excur&s;ion afforded &s;ome amu&s;ement to a certain cla&s;s of readers.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="016020_0022_0F9B25677A3CD810">
Albeit, having, &s;ince then, been yoked to a dam&s;el who hath a pa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e watering places, and who (bringing along with her a decent dower) hath a right to indulge her&s;elf in &s;uch amu&s;ements as &s;eem be&s;t unto her, I have now a <HI>&s;econd</HI> opportunity to &s;urvey the cu&s;toms and manners of water-drinkers and duckers; and can give you, my friend, many curious particulars by way of &s;upplement to the accounts I have already publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>As my pre&s;ent cure is &s;ituated about thirty|&s;even po&s;t miles and a quarter, more or le&s;s (one cannot be cla&s;&s;ically correct to a yard) from the waters of BUXTON, amid&s;t the wonders of the Peake, Mrs. HOMESPUN cho&s;e to pa&s;s a week at that place, for the benefit of a pain in the ancle, which pain became grievous about &s;ix minutes before &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted to me the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an excur&s;ion. Very &s;udden, to be &s;ure. But humanity is frail; and women are whim|&s;ical.</P>
<P>That the cure of her ancle might be perfect|ly compleated, I contrived it &s;o, as to per&s;uade the curate of a neighbouring pari&s;h, to do duty at home in my ab&s;ence, and re&s;olved to tarry a fortnight. Of this fortnight, only four days are yet expired; and though I never underwent the
<PB N="24" REF="016020_0023_0F9B2568383D8D70">
&s;ame degree of parade, of fatigue, and of imper|tinence, in any former <HI>fourteen</HI> years of my life,&mdash;not even when I preached thrice on the Sunday, and fairly footed it to two of the cures,&mdash;yet HARRIET &s;eems &s;o happy in <HI>doing as others do,</HI> and finds &s;uch real felicity in the dull|e&s;t &s;pot I ever beheld, becau&s;e, &s;he &s;ays, it is the <HI>Ton,</HI> that I am in doubt whether even the long re&s;idue of the fortnight will &s;ati&s;fy her; or whether &s;he will by that time have had <HI>Ton</HI> enough to return home to peace, privacy and the par&s;onage-hou&s;e, without murmurings and repinings.</P>
<P>Oh! Doctor, &s;ee the outlines of my &s;ituation, and pity me. I am among&s;t a number of both &s;exes who&s;e plea&s;ures are my aver&s;ions, and who&s;e amu&s;ements I cannot reli&s;h. Quietude and the &s;hade of life emparadi&s;e me, and yet the hou&s;e, wherein I lodge, is as public as an inn at a fair. I admire rural ornaments, and &s;cenes of &s;ummer verdure beyond imagination; I rejoice to &s;ee the bud broaden, and the blo&s;|&s;oms expand before the &s;un, yet the mountains of Arabia De&s;erta exhibit not a pro&s;pect more barren and unblooming, than that by which this BUXTON is bounded. I love moreover to &s;troll into the &s;hop of an intelligent book&s;eller, and there conver&s;e with him upon the topic of
<PB N="25" REF="016020_0024_0F9B2568F88E12B8">
recent publications;&mdash;alas! the book&s;eller of BUXTON has nothing in his &s;hop but the tra&s;h that circulates at a watering-place among&s;t the women. I ran my eye over his catalogue, and never did I &s;ee &s;uch a collection: Clelia, Ca&s;|&s;andra, Pamela, the Adventures of Cleopatra, Amu&s;ements at the German Spa, and the Hi&s;|tory of an Actre&s;s, were the be&s;t in this bad bundle. But though I &s;aw folly, I made bold to a&s;k for &s;en&s;e: at lea&s;t, what pa&s;&s;es as &s;uch.</P>
<P>I mentioned the Reviews&mdash;no-body called for <HI>them.</HI> It is not the <HI>Ton</HI> to be critical. I talked of the Magazines&mdash;none were ordered; Magazines are too multiplied, and too common to be the <HI>Ton.</HI> I rummaged every row for <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI>&mdash;no-body reads philo&s;ophy at a watering-place. The Philo&s;ophy of Fools might &s;urely have found a place. I critici&s;ed the &s;helves for <HI>morals,</HI> but found them not. I ventured to a&s;k, but with &s;ome little he&s;itation, for Secker's Lectures&mdash;I &s;eemed to have taken away the book&s;eller's breath: he never heard of them. I took a turn round the &s;hop, and (having forgot to bring any books with me, although very booki&s;h) would have taken up with almo&s;t any thing <HI>approximating</HI> to the rational; but, in my progre&s;s, I had well-nigh
<PB N="26" REF="016020_0025_0F9B2569B872A348">
over&s;et a gla&s;s-ca&s;e of toothpicks, gold hu&s;&s;ies, embroidered pincu&s;hions, and embo&s;&s;ed &s;nuff|boxes.</P>
<P>And now it appeared, that this harlequin trader was rather a haberda&s;her, than a book|&s;eller; or rather an ambiguous multiform mer|chant, who dealt in the apparatus both of the &s;oul and the body.</P>
<P>On ca&s;ting my eyes towards a per&s;on at the other end of the &s;hop, I &s;aw her bending wire, to form, what is, in this merry age, facetiou&s;ly called, a cap; over this per&s;on's head in fair arrangement, was to be &s;een a goodly &s;how of bandboxes; and acro&s;s the window near which &s;he &s;at, were ribbons variou&s;ly and ridiculou&s;ly twi&s;ted, with &s;everal &s;pecimens of her &s;kill in decorating that part of the human body, which is <HI>now</HI> more prepo&s;terous than any other. See|ing &s;uch preparations for the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> of the head, I gave up the idea of finding any <HI>internal</HI> furniture; &s;o walking out of the &s;hop, I a&s;ked pardon for having &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;taken a milli|ner's and toyman's for a vender of matters in the literary way.&mdash;Ju&s;t as I got to the door, a party of mighty pretty women, and my wife among&s;t the re&s;t (not the lea&s;t amiable, and who, already knew every body) came ru&s;tling

into the &s;hop, and in a li&s;ping accent (it is not <HI>toni&s;h</HI> to &s;peak plain, or do the vowels ju&s;tice) attuned to the articulation of a watering-place, de&s;ired the haberda&s;hery-millinery book&s;eller to look for JULIA MANDEVILLE&mdash;Julia Man|deville was not to be had, being, as &s;aid the dealer, very much run upon. Then let us have SIDNEY BIDDULPH, &s;aid the ladies&mdash;Sidney Biddulph was out, being likewi&s;e a lady in con&s;tant reque&s;t. I'm for, THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART, cried a very grave-looking woman; who &s;urely made a &s;mall mi&s;take in the choice of her reading. I wi&s;h, my dear, (&s;aid my wife to me, with a very well-bred ci|vility, taking le&s;s notice of me than u&s;ual&mdash;it is <HI>quite</HI> out of the <HI>Ton</HI> to be tender, Doctor,) you had brought JOSEPH ANDREWS along with you&mdash;Oh la! Ma'am, replied another, how can you po&s;&s;ibly read &s;uch <HI>low</HI> &s;tuff&mdash;the ad|ventures of a footman, a kitchen-wench, and a &s;trolling par&s;on&mdash;Nay, Madam, &s;aid HAR|RIET, don't &s;ay any thing again&s;t the par&s;ons, pray; remember I'm a clergyman's wife, and there he &s;tands&mdash;an ABRAHAM ADAMS every inch of him&mdash;a'nt you, my dear?</P>
<P>This was too much; I attempted to go forth, but HARRIET caught me by the coat (it is

preci&s;ely the <HI>Ton</HI> to tea&s;e a hu&s;band, Doctor.) The poor ladies were in great anxiety to find THESE MISTAKES OF THE HEART had been carried off la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, by a per&s;on who took the road to GRETNA GREEN&mdash;the Scotch mar|rying village&mdash;with her footman, in her way to London; though &s;ome (&s;aid the haberda&s;her archly) may think <HI>that</HI> was going a round-about way too. If we can't get THE MISTAKES, &s;uppo&s;e, rejoined the ladies, we have a flight to the PARADISE OF FOOLS? or &s;uppo&s;e we make a &s;hift, till we can get &s;omething <HI>better,</HI> with TOM JONES?&mdash;Aye, TOM JONES is tolerable enough, (&s;aid a pale languid lady) if he would but &s;ay more about the &s;eraphic SOPHIA, and give us le&s;s non&s;en&s;e about the old vulgar fa|ther, the fu&s;ty aunt, and tho&s;e unertertaining horrid creatures THWACKUM and SQUARE. He is &s;hockingly tedious about tho&s;e fellows. As to his Introductory Chapters, as he calls them, I always &s;kip'em. Aye, Madam, &s;aid another, and if he was a little plainer in telling us what we were really to expect, at the top of his chapters, it would be as well; in which ca&s;e I really think it would be a <HI>goodi&s;h, prettyi&s;h</HI> &s;ort of a novel, to <HI>read once.</HI> Tom Jones, it &s;eems, was now in reading by Lady Sallow's coachman.&mdash;The haberda&s;her recommended

<P>The laugh was now more violent than the wit was brilliant by which it was occa&s;ioned, and my dear HARRIET joined in it, mo&s;t cor|dially.</P>
<P>They were about to depart without any books at all, when the haberda&s;her mentioned &s;ome old volumes of the Spectator.

<HEAD>LETTER IX. SEDLEY to THORNTON.</HEAD>
<P>OH! for the genius of old HORATIUS FLAC|CUS, to compre&s;s a volume of facts within the foldings of a &s;ingle &s;heet of paper!&mdash;Hear,&mdash;&s;ee,&mdash;be convinced,&mdash;congratulate me, and &s;ing a <HI>Te Deum</HI> to thy friend, and to the immortal memory of STANHOPE.</P>
<P>The party, of which I was made one, con|&s;i&s;ted of ma&s;ter mini&s;ter HOMESPUN, his lady, an animal who burle&s;qued the coxcomb, and a fourth per&s;on who departed before the entrance of &s;upper, &s;o that of him I &s;hall &s;ay nothing at pre&s;ent.&mdash;HOMESPUN and his wife are oppo|&s;ites, and therefore the better &s;uited to the <HI>trial of &s;kill.</HI> At fir&s;t, I &s;aid no more than ju&s;t to
<PB N="32" REF="016020_0031_0F9B256FBAA62900">
&s;hew my breeding, and inclination to be happy in their &s;ociety. I let them &s;hew off <HI>them&s;elves</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible, that I might accurately learn their tempers, before I ventured to attack them. This is one of the very fir&s;t elementary principles of my &s;y&s;tem. HOMESPUN &s;oon di&s;covered him&s;elf to be a grubber in books, and his lady a grubber in the fa&s;hions; in her tem|per, gay, giddy, good-natured, un&s;u&s;picious and uninformed. The coxcomb was of the neutral kind, but wi&s;hed to be flattered, for his ta&s;te in per&s;onal ornaments; and of cour&s;e, was flatter|ed. Never was there a more curious trio. The conver&s;ation turned at fir&s;t, as it u&s;ually does among the Engli&s;h, upon weather, then upon books, then upon dre&s;s, then upon the virtue of certain characters of the books, and la&s;t, upon the virtue of the BUXTON waters. I accom|modated my&s;elf to the &s;everal changes with to|lerable felicity. You mu&s;t con&s;ider me, how|ever, but as a beginner;&mdash;note my progre&s;s.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, to touch the tender part of our book-worm, I ob&s;erved, that the public &s;u&s;tain|ed a great lo&s;s in the death of &s;everal literary or|naments of the age. I &s;poke critically, as to the &s;atiric powers of CHARLES CHURCHIL; and poetically, as to the Pindaric flights of
<PB N="33" REF="016020_0032_0F9B257079C152F8">
GRAY. I entered into the intricacies of the epic, and drew the line betwixt the original HOMER and the imitator VIRGIL. I &s;poke of ea&s;e, in the &s;tyle of TILLOTSON, of grace in ADDISON, and of the pathetic, in the periods of YORICK. I affected even to di&s;countenance the inuendo of TRISTRAM SHANDY, and I compared his licentious &s;pirit with the voluptu|ous OVID. I pretended to di&s;cover an o&s;tenta|tious di&s;play of talents in the Orations and Epi&s;tles of CICERO; and I took care to &s;uit eve|ry opinion to the <HI>ta&s;te</HI> of the per&s;on I addre&s;&s;ed, who had his &s;hare in the conver&s;ation too, and who (as I have &s;ince heard) mentions me to his friends as a paragon of learning. Take this, THORNTON, as a receipt to make a &s;cholar a &s;impleton!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell thee, that, when I was talking upon books, and mentioned the ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM Mrs. HOMESPUN (though <HI>no</HI> &s;impleton) a&s;ked me, with great &s;implicity, if that &s;ame critici&s;m was a <HI>novel;</HI> to which the fop an&s;wered, <HI>Yes,</HI> it came out la&s;t year, and was written by an intimate friend of his; but that, though <HI>he</HI> pu&s;hed it with all his intere&s;t, it did not <HI>take,</HI> and was now totally buried in oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="016020_0033_0F9B257138E18218">
I contradicted this with all po&s;&s;ible politene&s;s&mdash;<HI>I imagined he might be mi&s;taken;</HI> (never ap|pear a&s;&s;ured, THORNTON) that work, <HI>I believed,</HI> was attributed to Lord KAIMES&mdash;a writer, with whom I did <HI>not doubt</HI> but he was ac|quainted, Po&s;&s;ibly he might confound the title a little, with others &s;imilar to it; which might very ea&s;ily be done. I had caught <HI>my&s;elf</HI> in &s;uch errors a thou&s;and times. Mr. HOMESPUN chuckled at my candour. Mrs. HOMESPUN (I know by her eyes, I read every body's eyes) &s;aid &s;omething to her hu&s;band, in a low voice, in my favour; and the fop him&s;elf, with a &s;mile of complacence, but without any confu&s;ion at detected ignorance,&mdash;he wants the ta&s;te to blu&s;h&mdash;(&s;uch, THORNTON, is the force of <HI>manner!)</HI>&mdash;&s;aid, it was very likely he might be mi&s;led by the title; that there were three or four <HI>elements,</HI> and he was mo&s;t &s;uperlatively obliged to me for &s;etting him right.</P>
<P>Upon the topic of <HI>dre&s;s,</HI> a fruitful theme, I took care to agree with Mrs. HOMESPUN in every particular; except that, now and then, I affected, in a gentle tone of voice, and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive &s;mile of countenance, to differ from her, on purpo&s;e to throw the triumph on <HI>her</HI> &s;ide, make her happy in an ideal &s;uperiority, the
<PB N="35" REF="016020_0034_0F9B2571FAB557B8">
better to impre&s;s her with a proper notion of my good manners, in yielding to conviction.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock, the fop hopped out, and took me by the hand in token of &s;atisfac|tion. Hone&s;t HORACE (that is his right cla&s;|&s;ical and Chri&s;tian name) con&s;iders me as his comforter, and declares, that, he hopes for &s;ome happine&s;s now, even in a watering place; while Mrs. HOMESPUN, or, as I &s;hall call her here|after, (to u&s;e as little as po&s;&s;ible that vulgar name) HARRIET, makes no &s;cruple of &s;aying, I am the mo&s;t chatty, agreeable man at the bath.</P>
<P>I caught her, THRONTON, twice mea&s;uring me from top to bottom, and then &s;he gave HORACE a &s;urvey.&mdash;By the &s;oft, half-&s;up|pre&s;&s;ed &s;igh &s;he gave at the end of it, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee&mdash;who&s;e dimen&s;ions &s;he likes be&s;t.</P>
<L>"Thus far we run before the wind."</L>
<P>Oh! THORNTON, if I can once bring her to be di&s;contented with her &s;ituation,&mdash;if &s;he once begins to repent of her bargain, the day is my own! I never &s;aw a pair of eyes more like|ly to fail in love than hers; they turn with a ca&s;t of concupi&s;cence to the azure corners. The eyes of HORACE are grey, and without

I have a &s;cene to paint to thee that might &s;haw the frigid feelings of an Anchorite.</P>
<P>About one o'clock in the morning, the eyes of HORACE began to twinkle&mdash;what was be|fore dull became duller, till at la&s;t the four eye|la&s;hes met together, and covered the balls of &s;ight. HARRIET continued loquacious and lively, and re&s;olved not to go to bed till it was a more <HI>modi&s;h</HI> hour, in&s;i&s;ting, that I &s;hould keep her company. I humoured her vivacity till HORACE began to &s;nore, and then &s;hifted the conver&s;ation to &s;omething le&s;s &s;pirited, but to &s;omething more attaching.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I REALLY begin to think, I &s;hall find &s;ome &s;atisfaction at BUXTON bath, amid&s;t a clu&s;|ter of in&s;ignificant characters, one gentleman has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o much above the re&s;t, that I have at once gratified my pride, and curio&s;ity, in obtaining his acquaintance.</P>
<P>He is intimately &s;killed in polite and elegant learning; perfectly well mannered, and not a|bove conver&s;ing upon &s;ubjects of divinity, and ethics, even at a watering-place. My wife

<P>In truth, I am apt to think very favourably of him, e&s;pecially, as his exterior does not &s;eem more frank and open, than his interior is inge|nuous and undi&s;gui&s;ed. <HI>One</HI> &s;uch character will atone for the &s;tupidity of the <HI>re&s;t.</HI> As I am fond of, now and then, what I call a wood|walk, or a ramble by my&s;elf, I can now take <HI>this</HI> without a breach of good manners; for I can leave this accompli&s;hed gentleman with HARRIET, who is fond enough of his com|pany to accept of him in <HI>my</HI> ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>I am half inclined to forgive watering-places, becau&s;e they have, in the end, after much prior di&s;appointment, produced a companion, who&s;e &s;entiments, of life, and maxims of <HI>moral</HI> con|duct, do credit to him&s;elf, and honour to the &s;pecies.</P>

<P>OH! that I could live to BUXTON for ever!&mdash;We have, &s;ince I la&s;t wrote to you, got acquainted with the hand&s;ome&s;t man in the world; and though he is as good a &s;cholar as HORACE, yet he under&s;tands as well as I do, all the prettine&s;&s;es of <HI>dre&s;s,</HI> of which, you know, HORACE is entirely ignorant.

<P>At &s;upper la&s;t night, HORACE was in one of his thoughtful moods, and di&s;gu&s;ted me hor|ridly.</P>
<P>There was a roa&s;ted fowl; and HORACE, perceiving my plate empty, mu&s;t needs fill it with one of the wings, which he made &s;hift to mangle off with the knife with which he had been eating, though another for the purpo&s;e was lying on the other &s;ide the di&s;h.

HENRY. The very fir&s;t trial I made to reduce my favourite precepts to practice, was upon the heart of this very girl, then glowing with all the graces of health, and endowed with all the enchantments of a <HI>pathetic</HI> temper. I &s;oon pretended to lo&s;e <HI>my</HI> vivacity, and became the &s;ofte&s;t &s;on of &s;entiment that ever was born.

<P>Several tran&s;ient tete-a-tetes I had with her there, gave me the opportunities I wi&s;hed. Her pa&s;&s;ion was imaginary, but plea&s;ing&mdash;&s;he fixed high the &s;tandard of dome&s;tic felicity, and un|rea&s;onably loved to refine.</P>
<P>To accommodate my&s;elf to <HI>this,</HI> was, at fir&s;t, not ea&s;y; but before I quitted SCARBOROUGH, I was &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for the <HI>pen&s;ero&s;o,</HI> that even Sir HENRY him&s;elf began to think I was falling into a hypochondriac di&s;order, and u&s;ed every effort to divert me.</P>
<P>Though I was then but a novice in the the|ory of joy, I had read enough of CHESTER|FIELD to know the potency of <HI>di&s;&s;imulation;</HI> and, had it been in my power to have &s;taid <HI>another week,</HI> &s;hould have, even <HI>then,</HI> added an il|lu&s;trious

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Doctor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are all wrong again!&mdash;The head of poor HARRIET is certainly turned; and, in&s;tead of a cure being performed, &s;he is cer|tainly di&s;tracted, by the&s;e &s;ame waters of BUX|TON. This day we drank tea in private, and
<PB N="59" REF="016020_0058_0F9B2584D0BD6680">
never heard I &s;uch a train of conver&s;ation as &s;he fell into. Why, Doctor, &s;he is <HI>gone</HI>&mdash;her intellects I mean&mdash;pa&s;t redemption.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t time in her life, &s;he found fault with every thing I did. She in&s;i&s;ted upon it, I drank my tea <HI>too hot,</HI> which was not only, &s;he &s;aid, injurious to the coat of the &s;tomach, but &s;hockingly <HI>indelicate.</HI></P>
<P>The tea-&s;poon was not managed to her &s;ati&s;|faction. I &s;ipped too <HI>loud</HI> from the <HI>&s;aucer,</HI> when it would, I find, have been <HI>genteeler</HI> to apply a <HI>&s;ilent</HI> lip to the <HI>cup.</HI> Nay, what is wor&s;e than all this, I had the misfortune to fold the bread and butter <HI>inelegantly;</HI> and it would have been better there too, if I had put the <HI>end,</HI> rather than the <HI>&s;ide</HI> of it, to my mouth fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But that which mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed me, was her objection to the good old cu&s;tom of <HI>turning down</HI> my cup, which &s;he &s;aid was out of the TON, and that it would give her great plea&s;ure, if, in fu|ture, I would lay the <HI>&s;poon acro&s;s</HI> the cup.</P>
<P>I was perfectly petrified, and yet <Q>held my tongue, and &s;pake nothing.</Q>&mdash;She propo&s;ed walking, and, as I really thought the air might do the poor creature's head good, I drew on my gloves, and attended her towards the well-walk.
<PB N="60" REF="016020_0059_0F9B2585A2E0BDD0">
&mdash;Alas! Doctor, nothing, I fear, can bring her about; for &s;he grew ten times wor&s;e than ever, and if I was a&s;toni&s;hed before, I was now al|mo&s;t &s;truck dead with the hugene&s;s of my a|mazement.</P>
<P>I had not the happine&s;s to hit her fancy even in my walk, which &s;he very fairly told me, was <HI>ridiculous;</HI> and that I held up my head too high, turned <HI>in</HI> my toes too much, and wanted the <HI>Graces</HI> in my arms.</P>
<P>She actually made an objection to the <HI>manner</HI> in which my wig was powdered, &s;aid it was all patches, and had not the regular &s;prinkling of a man of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Upon this, I ventured gently to tell her, that I was but a country curate, that I had no pre|ten&s;ions to <HI>fa&s;hion</HI>&mdash;that I had, for my own part, nothing to do at a watering-place, but to oblige her&mdash;that I was very &s;orry for the lof|tine&s;s of my head, which, for the time to come, &s;hould be carried with more humility&mdash;that, if it would give her any plea&s;ure, I would take care to &s;toop till I bent neck and &s;houlders to|gether&mdash;that, as to inver&s;ion of the toes, I would learn to dance, late in the day as it was for me, and incon&s;i&s;tent as &s;uch a part might
<PB N="61" REF="016020_0060_0F9B258639AAAA30">
be thought to the clerical character&mdash;in re|gard to my arms, that I had hitherto only u&s;ed them in the ordinary offices of life, and found they performed very well for a plain man; but that, if &s;he had any favourite attitudes, or wi&s;h|ed me to exhibit in any po&s;tures to which &s;he was particularly partial, I would practice vigi|lantly at the looking-gla&s;s, and, rather than want the <HI>Graces</HI> &s;he &s;poke of, would ab&s;olutely learn the exerci&s;e, and go through all the forms and ceremonies of legs, arms, head, and hands, like a young recruit. At the &s;ame time I beg|ged her to con&s;ider that, as we had, &s;icne the day of our union, lived harmoniou&s;ly, I warmly hoped we &s;hould not be put of tune by trifles, which are in them&s;elves in&s;ignificant, even if we admitted them to be e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>etiquette</HI> of a watering-place. I, moreover, told her to remember, that I was at lea&s;t a <HI>faithful</HI> hu&s;band, and made her happine&s;s the &s;tudy, practice, and contrivance, of my whole life; and that, &s;urely, where the cardinal duties were ob&s;erved, it mattered little, whether the toes were the breadth of a barley corn too much in or out, or the head half an inch too lofty, or half an inch too low. I would have proceeded in my de|fence, but that my good friend Mr. SEDLEY at that in&s;tant came to my relief, told us, <HI>as he
<PB N="62" REF="016020_0061_0F9B2586FA00D8B0">
advanced with warmth, vivacity, and a chearful countenance, that, </HI><Q><HI>if we did ju&s;tice to his at|tachment to us, we might judge of the joy he felt in &s;eeing us &s;o frequently choo&s;e a private path, which was to him a certain indication of matrimonial felicity.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o pretty in his &s;peech, that it made an impre&s;&s;ion on my memory, and I have copied it <HI>verbatim.</HI> In le&s;s than half an hour Mrs. HOMESPUN recovered her rea&s;on; her late lunacy was never hinted at, and hope|ing to continue her good-nature, I invited this mo&s;t agreeable gentleman to take another bit of &s;upper with us.</P>
<P>The manner in which he accepted the invi|tation trebled the &s;en&s;e of the favour he did me by his company. What a gratification it is to have &s;o &s;en&s;ible and entertaining a friend at a watering-place!</P>

<P>A MAN, THORNTON, who is <HI>true</HI> to the re|li&s;h of plea&s;ure, can extract extacy even from di&s;appointment. The <HI>bli&s;s of bli&s;&s;es</HI> alone could have made me happier than I was an hour ago.</P>
<P>Hear the &s;tory.</P>
<P>Since the fir&s;t moment I ca&s;t my eye upon the bewitching HARRIET, I marked her for my own; and <HI>&s;he</HI> hath &s;ince been the <HI>grand</HI> point of all my in&s;inuation and ingenuity. Not a &s;ingle article hath been neglected that could touch her imagination, move her heart, and catch her <HI>favourite weakne&s;&s;es.</HI> I paid court to her fancy, to her feelings, to her foibles.

<P>La&s;t night, my THORNTON, was the con|&s;cious period that yielded up every tran&s;port but <HI>the one.</HI> HORACE was reque&s;ted to perform the funeral-&s;ervice over the corp&s;e of a fellow who died by a drop&s;y; (as the par&s;on of the

pari&s;h was indi&s;po&s;ed;) and, it &s;eems, he was to be buried at a town a mile di&s;tant from our lodgings.</P>
<P>He went.&mdash;The opportunity was not to be omitted. I exerted my&s;elf. I &s;parkled in the lu&s;tre of STANHOPEAN &s;entiments&mdash;I became eloquent, and &s;oon communicated a part of <HI>my</HI> ardour to the troubled bo&s;om of HARRIET. I hit her, &s;oft upon the heart.

The dalliance was no longer to be borne; &s;he begged me, for God's &s;ake, to de&s;i&s;t. The flu&s;h of de&s;ire and mode&s;ty were at war in her cheek&mdash;her bo&s;om palpitated&mdash;I plied her with my precious maxims in a whi&s;per, that gave them additional graces&mdash;I laid my hand upon her heart: the throb was violent; and, as I caught her eagerly in my arms, her head &s;unk

in unre&s;i&s;ting &s;oftne&s;s on my &s;houlder, and, worked to the extreme betwixt &s;entiment and &s;en&s;ation, &s;he bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>I compo&s;ed her cheek&mdash;drew her handker|chief gently over her eye, fixed her again without offering to di&s;tre&s;s her, in her chair; and to this moment &s;he thinks I &s;acrificed, to love, re&s;pect, delicacy, and friend&s;hip, a pa&s;&s;ion that is tearing me to pieces.</P>
<P>In a few minutes HOMESPUN returned; he is no reader of looks, and I took my leave for the night with that <HI>ea&s;y intrepid a&s;&s;urance,</HI> which belongs to the great character I have adopted.</P>
<P>And now, THORNTON, am I not a tolerable proficient in the &s;cience of di&s;&s;imulation? Does any-thing come ami&s;s to me?

<P>About an hour after we were in bed, &s;he complained that there was no bearing the heat; though, in truth, this is one of the colde&s;t places in England, and it had rained all the preceding evening.

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. Mi&s;s DELIA DELMORE to Lady LUCY SAXBY.</HEAD>
<P>FANNY is much di&s;ordered, my dear LUCY; the fainting with which &s;he was &s;eized at the breakfa&s;t-rooms, has preyed on her ever &s;ince. Her &s;pirits are greatly agitated. Her hu&s;band attends her, with the diligence of a nur&s;e, and cannot be per&s;uaded to leave her chamber. The poor girl often drops the tear of gratitude, but &s;peaks le&s;s than u&s;ual, as, &s;he &s;ays, talking exhau&s;ts her. She has twice hint|ed her wi&s;hes to be removed from hence, either to my father's, or to SCARBOROUGH, as we thought proper: and begs her removal may be pretty late at night, for company, &s;he &s;ays, ra|ther di&s;turbs her, &s;icne her la&s;t accident. Poor MORTIMER, her hu&s;band, &s;ees her dying by inches before his face, and his unavailing offi|ciou&s;ne&s;s appears now and then, to go too near the heart of the &s;inking FANNY. She is too indi&s;po&s;ed to remove at pre&s;ent: for my part, I have not been able to &s;et my foot yet in the &s;treet: I love my &s;i&s;ter too tenderly, to leave her with a &s;trange woman, in a &s;trange place, e&s;pecially with one, who is merely paid for her attention, and who, con&s;equently, can have none of tho&s;e charming thoughts that enter in|to

to the heart of a tender relation. Sometimes, my dear, the changing a po&s;ture, &s;ometimes he &s;hifting a pillow, or fixing a chair, does more by the <HI>method</HI> of doing it, than all the e|laborate efforts of an avowed nur&s;e. A Mr. SEDLEY&mdash;who is &s;aid to be the beauty of the bath, and was the per&s;on that handed FANNY down &s;tairs, and was very obliging during her illne&s;s,&mdash;&s;ends every day, very re&s;pectfully, to know how the &s;ick lady improves in her health. As many of both &s;exes were witne&s;s to poor FANNY's di&s;tre&s;s, and as people <HI>&s;hould</HI> have a fellow-feeling, in places of general re|&s;ort for cures, as well as fa&s;hions, I wonder <HI>others</HI> have not paid this &s;weet girl the &s;ame compliment.</P>
<P>The <HI>manner</HI> in which this gentleman makes the enquiry, is pretty: he does not pre&s;ume upon the privilege of a public place, and &s;end a blundering foot-boy with a me&s;&s;age, nor does he come, intruding, <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> but he u&s;ually writes a little billet, (every day varied, and con|taining a new turn,) in which his expre&s;&s;ions di&s;cover at once accompli&s;hment and high|breeding; and, what puts it out of any body's power to mi&s;con&s;true it into de&s;ign, he always addre&s;&s;es his cards to Mr. MORTIMER.&mdash;As my brother was reading one of the&s;e this

<P>She is now in a gentle do&s;e, and I took the opportunity it gave, to inform my dear LUCY of our pre&s;ent melancholy &s;ituation. Sir HEN|RY, and my mother are expected hourly. If FANNY really dies, my mother will certainly go di&s;tracted. Heaven ble&s;s you, and yours.</P>

<P>I HAVE appeared in public.

Alas! THORNTON, what a pity, what a mortification! I have not a &s;ingle competitor,&mdash;I mean not in point of <HI>gallantry,</HI> for that militates again&s;t my &s;y&s;tem of plea&s;ure,&mdash;but, horrid to tell, there is no one of <HI>my</HI> &s;ex from whom I can gain any real honour in the compari&s;on.

be for our intere&s;t to work upon; I began to &s;hew off, and brought the whole company over, as my admirers. I practi&s;ed all the charming conver&s;ation rules of DORMER, with as much facility as if I had been their authors and, indeed, they are &s;o &s;uited to my own na|tural &s;entiments, that I only con&s;ider <HI>him</HI> as having <HI>written,</HI> what I long ago <HI>thought,</HI> and what, indeed, I will hence forward invariably practi&s;e, till I am incapable of further enjoy|ment.

<PB N="98" REF="016020_0097_0F9B25A379D79A18">

If any-thing, &s;he is more cordial to me than be|fore my departure from the curacy, and is at once lively and obliging.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, the &s;trange conduct I tran&s;mitted you an account of in my late letters, was only a tran&s;ient giddine&s;s, not very infre|quent, as I have ob&s;erved. Doctor, to the fair &s;ex, about HARRIET'S age, which is very well called, in one of Shake&s;peare's tragedies that I read formerly, the "heyday of youthful blood." We grave folks, you know, my dear DIGGORY, ought to allow for all this. Poor thing, I pity her, and am half angry with my&s;elf that I &s;hould have treated the overflowing, efferve&s;|cent emanations, as I may &s;tile them, of a juve|nile mind, as a &s;erious delirium.</P>
<P>But, thank God, it is not gone abroad to any per&s;on who is capable of circulating the whi&s;|per

But do not, I charge you think too hardly of her for what hath been &s;aid. It was all a mi&s;repre&s;entation, and you &s;hould admire your heavenly HARRIET, as you u&s;ed to call her, the <HI>more</HI> for having been <HI>injured.</HI> I can a&s;&s;ure you, I am at pre|&s;ent more &s;ati&s;fied with <HI>her</HI> than I am with <HI>my&s;elf:</HI> and, indeed, &s;he has the advantage of me; for &s;he appears in the light of a per&s;on <HI>calumniated,</HI> and I am only one in a &s;tate of con&s;cious error, and <HI>probation.</HI></P>

<P>THERE is nothing, &s;aith my creed, <Q>&s;o delicate as a man's moral character, and nothing which it is &s;o much his <HI>intere&s;t</HI> to pre&s;erve pure.</Q>&mdash;I have been at church, THORNTON, where HOMESPUN officiated as teacher. He hath a &s;nuffle in his no&s;e; his voice is de&s;titute of that harmonious variety, e&s;&s;ential to all &s;orts of eloquence; and his or|gans of articulation appear con&s;iderably ob|&s;tructed.</P>

However, like a true Pupil of Plea&s;ure, I took him by the hand, upon his de&s;cending from the pulpit; returned him my &s;incere thanks, in a well invented compliment, for the <HI>elegance</HI> of his di&s;cour&s;e; applauded his <HI>delivery;</HI> lamented that I had not <HI>often</HI> been made &s;o happy; and almo&s;t brought the tears of <HI>virtuous vanity,</HI> into the good man's eyes, at the pathos of my conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"A little flattery &s;ometimes does well."</P>
<P>"There is no living in the world," you know, THORNTON, <Q>without a complai&s;ant indulgence for peoples weakne&s;&s;es.</Q> In a &s;hort time, I expect to reach the &s;ummit; for, after only an hour's practice, I found my&s;elf able to call out a palpable tear, only by placing a <HI>chair</HI> before my face, and, by the force of imagination, repre&s;enting <HI>it,</HI> poor thing! as a certain per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, which I had an <HI>in|tere&s;t</HI> in relieving. Yes&mdash;THORNTON&mdash;I am to be complimented on the faculty of weeping at will.</P>
<P>And now I am talking upon the &s;ubject of &s;ym|pathy, I mu&s;t tell thee, that I have made my&s;elf &s;till more popular than ever, in this little place, by &s;everal acts of <HI>uno&s;tentatious o&s;tentation</HI>&mdash;I

<HEAD>The Story of the Pretty Bath-Maid.</HEAD>
<P>AN'T plea&s;e your Honour, I am but a &s;er|vant, and live, by handing my water to gentry|folks. I have tended the well-&s;ide, &s;ince BUX|TON hath became <HI>famu&s;h;</HI> and nobody's tum|bler was oftener filled than mine. Till the
<PB N="110" REF="016020_0109_0F9B28F6384AFED8">
week before la&s;t, I was the happie&s;t water|wench that ever dipt her gla&s;s in the well: all the <HI>qallety</HI> knew me, all the ladies loved me, and all the gentlemen quarrelled which &s;hould drink fir&s;t; but matters are now altered, and I am <HI>a&s;heamed</HI> to take my <HI>stand</HI> at the place, becau&s;e of the ba&s;ene&s;s of your Honour's <HI>un|hone&s;t</HI> Mr. THOMAS.</P>
<P>The arts he has u&s;ed to tangle me, and take away my <HI>wartue,</HI> are mon&s;trous, and &s;uch as would make the &s;toute&s;t <HI>&s;he</HI> in the country &s;tumble. I am &s;ure, for my part, I &s;tood it till I could &s;tand it no longer. If your Honour will hear me out, and do me <HI>ju&s;tis,</HI> &s;eeing as my character is gone, and therewithal my wa|ter, and with that my bread, &s;o that I have now neither bread <HI>nor</HI> water, I will unfold every thing, and let your Goodne&s;s &s;ee the affair from top to bottom.</P>
<P>Poor girl, &s;it down, &s;it down: I am &s;orry for the lo&s;s of your water, with all my heart, and &s;hall very chearfully &s;ee as much of the affair as you think proper to &s;hew me&mdash;Sit down, therefore, child, and &s;hew away.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Sir, <HI>as how,</HI> when bathing and drinking the waters is over, and your Ho|nour and &s;uch-like fine folk are all bu&s;y a|dancing;
<PB N="111" REF="016020_0110_0F9B28F739D07210">
we &s;ervant-people, &s;ometimes get to|gether to a <HI>le&s;&s;errer</HI> room, and have a little hop of our own. This happened the very fir&s;t night I &s;aw Mr. THOMAS, who I ob&s;erved, &s;oon after he came into town, walk round the well, and then backwards and forwards; and to be &s;ure, there was &s;omething in his putting his foot to the ground, taking it off again, &s;winging his arm, flouri&s;hing his &s;witch, and &s;aluting the fellow-&s;ervants, that made him look a king to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, he <HI>chus'd</HI> me for his partner; and, though I &s;ay it, I can &s;hake a foot with my betters; nay, at a <HI>country</HI>-dance, I'll turn my back neither to gentle nor &s;imple.</P>
<P>If your Honour had heard the <HI>highflyers</HI> he crammed my poor head with, all the while we were at it&mdash;the &s;oft things he &s;aid while we led out&mdash;the <HI>wows</HI> he made, as we handed up the middle&mdash;and the tender oaths and <HI>ro|dermuntadoes</HI> he &s;wore, while we right and left|handed it or ca&s;t off, and joined hands again&mdash;while at the &s;ame time the mu&s;ic &s;truck up enough to melt one's heart&mdash;with candles lighted, and i' the &s;ummer-&s;ea&s;on&mdash;your Honour would not blame me &s;o much for giving away my &s;oul and body to the mo&s;t <HI>art|fulle&s;t</HI> of his <HI>&s;ect.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="016020_0111_0F9B28FA4EEAF840">
In &s;hort, Sir, he talkt me over &s;o finely about <HI>this</HI> and <HI>that,</HI> that before I left the room, and we broke up, I did not know whether I &s;tood upon my head or my heels.</P>
<P>After dancing was over, and Mr. THOMAS and I had made our&s;elves all of a heat, or, as I remember <HI>he</HI> called it, all of an <HI>ardor,</HI> we took a walk in the grove by the hall, to cool our|&s;elves. And <HI>there</HI> he began to flouri&s;h it again&mdash;overpowered me with &s;uch an ocean of love &s;ayings, and, in &s;hort, talked &s;o differently from my old &s;weetheart ROGER DOUSIT, who is all dull and downright, as I may &s;ay, that I <HI>de|clares</HI> to your Honour, he at la&s;t made me think it would be a &s;in to refu&s;e him; and &s;o&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;and &s;o&mdash;</P>

<P>And &s;o&mdash;you did <HI>not</HI> refu&s;e him, hey?&mdash;Is that it?</P>
<P>Here the poor girl drew out her handker|chief, and had &s;incerely a very great occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>She told me, in a tone, THORNTON, that touched me, that if, notwith&s;tanding what THOMAS &s;aid, &s;he had been wicked, &s;he was a ruined woman, that was all&mdash;that it might do very well for <HI>gentlefolks</HI> to play fal&s;e with one

another, becau&s;e <HI>they</HI> had got <HI>wherewithal</HI> to wa&s;h all white again; but that a black &s;pot in a <HI>poor</HI> woman, who <HI>pended</HI> on her water&mdash;was never to be rubbed out:&mdash;that, moreover, the news had &s;ome-how got air, and &s;he was point|ed at by all the ill-natured fingers in the place. She &s;aid, with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;implicity, that the man fairly <HI>over&s;et</HI> her with his new-fangled <HI>gibberi&s;h</HI>&mdash;but that &s;he found 'twas all over with her. She added, that, for her own part, &s;he did not &s;o much mind it, as &s;he could turn her hand to any thing, and would leave the town in a twinkle; but that &s;he had an old mother that had been bedridden the&s;e eight months, who lived at FAIRFIELD, and who mu&s;t now want bread as well as her&s;elf. Nay, for that matter, &s;aid the girl, &s;he'll &s;oon be provided for, if &s;he hears of my &s;lip, without troubling the pari&s;h; for I &s;hall &s;oon break her heart: I &s;hall &s;oon &s;end my poor old mother out of the world; for &s;he is a <HI>good</HI> woman, Sir, and would &s;ooner bury me than &s;ee me what I am now. DOUSIT will turn up his no&s;e at me <HI>now;</HI> and without your Honour makes Mr. THOMAS do me <HI>ju&s;tis,</HI> &s;o as that I may become hone&s;t again, and do it in the lawful way,&mdash;God only knows what cour&s;e I mu&s;t take?</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="016020_0113_0F9B28FD624427E0">
She now dropt her tears, THORNTON, as fa&s;t, to u&s;e the language of Shake&s;peare,</P>
<L><HI>"As the Arabian tree</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Its medicinal gum.</HI></L>
<P>At this very moment THOMAS came in with a me&s;&s;age on which he had been di&s;patched.</P>
<P>What is it, THORNTON, what cur&s;ed trouble|&s;ome thing is it, at once invi&s;ible, and auda|cious, that lodges in our bo&s;oms beyond reach of our revenge, to make the &s;toute&s;t of us children and cowards?</P>
<P>Never did GARRICK exhibit, or SHAKE|SPEARE de&s;cribe, &s;uch a look and attitude, as that of poor TOM at his entrance, on ob&s;erving &s;o unexpected an object.</P>
<P>He &s;tammered, he &s;taggered, he turned white, and attempted to retreat.</P>
<P>I commanded him to &s;tay; and, taking my &s;word from the hook, gave him his choice, and one that might have puzzled a much wi&s;er man&mdash;either to die or marry. Fear operated even &s;o &s;trong as to make him chu&s;e the latter.</P>
<P>He fell on his knees, and would have entered into explanations. I would not hear them.&mdash;The ceremony that HAMLET u&s;es with his

quondam friends now pa&s;&s;ed between us, and I made them both &s;wear upon my &s;word.</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed them a dower&mdash;the woman was in extacy, and paid me by &s;uch a look of gra|titude, that, had REYNOLDS been there, he would have made the water-wench immortal by drawing it.</P>
<P>I am above altercation: of this THOMAS is aware. Nay, I believe he likes the girl.&mdash;They &s;hall be united as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: and what the devil can be the rea&s;on that I am more happy in putting the&s;e two people toge|ther, than all the joys I ever ta&s;ted with the exqui&s;ite and yielding HARRIET, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Were it not that I have contrived, as u&s;ual, to get HORACE out of the way, and that I never break an a&s;&s;ignation, I &s;hould certainly avoid &s;eeing <HI>her,</HI> or any body <HI>el&s;e,</HI> this evening.&mdash;Is not this unaccountable? But <HI>&s;o</HI> it is.</P>

<P>THE &s;tory of thy bath-maid, though da&s;hed with double meanings, intere&s;ted me &s;trangely; and I have felt the more plea&s;ure in giving it a tear, becau&s;e, I perceive, it hath penetrated even the almo&s;t invulnerable PHILIP SEDLEY.</P>
<P>But how thou art able to &s;tand the &s;hock of &s;o many radiant eyes, and yielded charms,&mdash;wrapt round and round as thou art in the ely|&s;ium of voluntary and voluptuous embraces&mdash;a young fellow of &s;pirit too&mdash;is, to <HI>me,</HI> mo&s;t unaccountably my&s;terious.&mdash;In defiance of all the cautionary precepts of thy divine DORMER&mdash;in defiance of all empirici&s;m in gallantry, I &s;hould certainly break out, and even at the ri&s;que of overturning the whole well-woven web of intrigue, dwindle into a downright inamorato, and &s;igh away &s;ubtle di&s;tinction be|twixt &s;imulation and laudable in&s;incerity. But thou art not a perfect Pupil of Plea&s;ure&mdash;Thou art but half converted.&mdash;Had&s;t thou not the &s;upreme of tran&s;port, in uniting the faithle&s;s footman to the beautiful bath-maid!</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="016020_0116_0F9B28FF85BB9EF0">
I'll tell thee what, SEDLEY,&mdash;thou art&mdash;(if thou wilt allow me for once the coinage of a new word)&mdash;thou art but half CHESTER|FIELDIZ'D&mdash;The impre&s;&s;ion made upon thee by the pale face of the con&s;cious THOMAS&mdash;the plea&s;ure thou ha&s;t at wiping away the drops of penitence and perturbation from the cherry cheek of &s;implicity&mdash;and thy wi&s;hing to &s;o|liloqui&s;e, and be excu&s;ed, even from the arms of the tempting and <HI>married</HI> HARRIET&mdash;are all &s;ymptoms totally <HI>un&s;tanhopean,</HI> (there's ano|ther word for thee.)</P>
<P>Take care, SEDLEY: thou art upon the eve of a relap&s;e&mdash;a relap&s;e in favour, not of DOR|MER, but of a down-right DOUSIT'S &s;ingle|dealing.</P>
<P>And yet, my friend, &s;hall I once again con|fe&s;s to you my infirmity&mdash;my une&s;tabli&s;hment in the maxims of thy preceptor?&mdash;I cannot <HI>blame</HI> thy weakne&s;&s;es, nor can I&mdash;however de&s;tructive they may be to <HI>thy</HI> &s;y&s;tem&mdash;avoid wi&s;hing thou may&s;t <HI>continue</HI> thy pre&s;ent ten|dencies, e&s;pecially as, by thy own hone&s;t con|fe&s;&s;ion, thou ha&s;t found more gratification in them, than in &s;upporting the toil&s;ome ta&s;k of di&s;ingenuity.</P>
<P>Nor ought I, indeed, to <HI>call</HI> this a weakne&s;s.
<PB N="118" REF="016020_0117_0F9B2900C6309458">
If to be happy is the ultimatum of all earthly pur&s;uits&mdash;if it is equally the effort of every different order of men, it a&s;&s;uredly follows, that <HI>that</HI> conduct is the mo&s;t rational by which the greate&s;t &s;hare of felicity is procured. The clo&s;e&s;t application of human wit and wi&s;dom can do no more than point out to thee the mo&s;t &s;olid degree of joy, and it matters not whether the joy is obtained by the practice of <HI>one</HI> &s;y&s;tem or <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t action thou ha&s;t recorded (I allude to the promi&s;ed nuptials of thy bath-maid) was evidently agreeable to the &s;entiments of SE|NECA, SOCRATES, and all the wi&s;e and good men both of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t; and &s;ince the precepts of STANHOPE have been unable to give thee a &s;uperior, or even an <HI>equal</HI> felicity, how proper and con&s;i&s;tent with right rea&s;on is it in me, to advi&s;e thee to walk in that path wherein thou ha&s;t found the mo&s;t plea&s;ure? Laugh not&mdash;ridicule not, I be&s;eech thee; thou art not, I hope, &s;o much a tool to the ta&s;te of the times&mdash;&s;o much a dupe to prejudiced opinions&mdash;as to di&s;like even the balance of bli&s;s which is now in thy favour, merely be|cau&s;e the &s;cale hath been turned by a worthy action&mdash;that would be in&s;anity.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="016020_0118_0F9B29016EBCEB88">
To love duplicity, and certain &s;ophi&s;tical di|&s;tinctions, merely for the &s;ake of double-deal|ing, and when plain, clear, clean, uncrooked hone&s;ty will an&s;wer thy purpo&s;e much <HI>better,</HI> is at once ridiculous and diabolical.</P>
<P>On the whole, therefore, I advi&s;e thee, in the deliberation of my heart, to &s;ub&s;titute the afore&s;aid SENECA, or &s;ome other &s;y&s;tematical morali&s;t, in&s;tead of STANHOPE; and to lay <HI>him</HI> quickly a&s;ide in a corner of thy trunk, as un|qualified to confer the comfort he profe&s;&s;es to admini&s;ter.</P>
<P>And, indeed, SEDLEY, to open thy whole &s;oul to thee, I mu&s;t own to thee, that I very much &s;u&s;pect his Lord&s;hip's &s;entiments. Even in my occa&s;ional dealings here in town, &s;ince thy departure, I have not been able to make them bear the te&s;t quite to my &s;atisfaction; &s;uch, e&s;pecially, as relate to the &s;eduction of the tender &s;ex.

<P>Thou art not a &s;tranger to the elegancies of
<PB N="120" REF="016020_0119_0F9B29024ADE5170">
SOPHIA VERNON, the new-married wife of the man who&s;e promotion from en&s;ign to lieute|nant it was our joint endeavour, &s;ome time ago, to effect it: his gratitude is &s;till&mdash;<Q>trem|bling alive all o'er;</Q> and, by a natural con|&s;equence, he is without the lea&s;t tincture of &s;u&s;picion, and e&s;teems every in&s;tance of parti|cular enquiry after his wife, or friend, as a mark of genero&s;ity in his benefactor.</P>
<P>This leaves the way to an intimacy with his SOPHIA fair and unob&s;tructed; and &s;he has al|ready caught &s;o much of the Lieutenant's en|thu&s;ia&s;m, that &s;he pays me the tribute of a ro|&s;y-red blu&s;h of acknowledgment as often as I approach her. They have lately purcha&s;ed a pretty cottage, amid&s;t the vernal beauties of SURRY: it is &s;urrounded by gardens, not <HI>citti&s;h,</HI> but genteel; there are no nudities, no mon|&s;trous urns, no fanta&s;tical fountains, no chubby cherubims, no tip-toed Mercuries, &s;mirking Venu&s;&s;es, nor &s;pruce holly-hedges; 'tis all "true Nature to advantage dre&s;&s;ed;" the ver|dure is voluptuous, the flower-beds well weed|ed, the &s;hrubbery gratefully &s;haded, and the alcove &s;miles upon the Thames.</P>
<P>Within this alcove I ye&s;terday took the tea that was prepared by the hand of SOPHIA,
<PB N="121" REF="016020_0120_0F9B2902F6A0CD60">
who&s;e hu&s;band had invited me pre&s;&s;ingly; to make the &s;olitude of his lady more &s;ocial by my company, as he was him&s;elf under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of taking a journey into SUSSEX.</P>
<P>As you love brooks and books, hills and rills, my dear Mr. THORNTON, &s;aid he, &s;milingly, you and SOPHY will be able to pa&s;s away your time to your mutual &s;atisfaction, till the return of your friend.</P>
<P>Poor un&s;u&s;picious pair!</P>
<P>They united their entreaties, and prevailed: Lieutenant VERNON &s;et out, and left to thy friend <HI>(in tru&s;t)</HI> the mo&s;t beautiful property upon the Thames. In a word, he began his journey in the fragrant coolne&s;s of ye&s;terday's evening, and I was left at full liberty to abu&s;e the confidence he placed in my integrity, and, in return for his ho&s;pitality, do my utmo&s;t to de&s;troy the cha&s;tity of <HI>her,</HI> whom he doats upon with the &s;incere&s;t tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The tear which &s;he dropt upon his hand as &s;he ki&s;&s;ed it, at parting, drew from him <HI>another,</HI> accompanied by &s;uch a look, as defies either tongue, pen, or pencil, and went at the time &s;o clo&s;e to my heart, that I could not but imagine the pa&s;&s;ion betwixt two, was more exqui&s;ite
<PB N="122" REF="016020_0121_0F9B2903AE508D58">
than if it were divided betwixt two-and-twen|ty. One man and one woman, thought I, may certainly be happier than a Sultan; and I had rather po&s;&s;e&s;s the real, <HI>undi&s;&s;imulated</HI> love of a SOPHIA VERNON, than command the keys of the &s;eraglio.</P>
<P>SOPHIA remained pen&s;ive, and &s;ighed after the travelling Lieutenant.</P>
<P>I examined the little library for a book to entertain her. CHESTERFIELD was there, but I did not think it a proper book to read, as I would wi&s;h to keep the maxims as far out of the &s;ight of a female as po&s;&s;ible: for when a woman is <HI>told the &s;ecret</HI> of her &s;eduction, &s;he will naturally be upon her guard again&s;t the &s;e|ducer; and, really, STANHOPE unfolds the art with &s;uch per&s;picuity, that &s;he who runs may read; nay, even thy footman comprehends the whole &s;y&s;tem, and hath, according to account, ruined his woman with a very <HI>tolerable addre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>By the bye, SEDLEY, I have to accu&s;e thee of two weak pieces of conduct. The fir&s;t is, thy ra&s;hne&s;s in tru&s;ting the epi&s;tles of thy pre|ceptor to the flighty HARRIET, who might have heedle&s;sly &s;hewn them to HORACE, by which means (as thou art a very &s;triking com|mentary upon the chapters of CHESTERFIELD)
<PB N="123" REF="016020_0122_0F9B2906E5D6AD10">
he would have had a clue to the original &s;ources of thy pre&s;ent conduct; and a detection of this kind would have been totally in&s;upportable. Thy other fault is, thy carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and, I might &s;ay, want of policy, in expo&s;ing the vo|lumes which thou &s;o pretende&s;t to venerate, to the plebeian eyes of thy <HI>valet.</HI> Lock them up, I pray thee, for the time to come; and if thou art re&s;olved to proceed in reducing them to practice, do it <HI>privately.</HI></P>
<P>In regard to SOPHIA, my endeavours to di|vert her thoughts <HI>from</HI> the beloved &s;ubject of their contemplation, were in vain: the Lieute|nant mingled in every idea, and &s;he had pa&s;|&s;ions, &s;ighs, &s;entiments, and &s;en&s;ations, only for Mr. VERNON. I recited to her an elegy from HAMMOND, and &s;he wept, in the &s;incerity of her heart, over images &s;o amiable, and &s;o &s;imi|lar to tho&s;e now &s;ugge&s;ted by her <HI>own</HI> &s;ituation. I wi&s;hed to divert her, by reading to her the oddities of corporal <HI>Trim,</HI> and uncle <HI>Toby;</HI> but &s;he was in no di&s;po&s;ition to be delighted with the whim&s;ical &s;trokes of a fine but irregular wit. I even adverted to the irre&s;i&s;tible &s;allies of HARRY FIELDING, and di&s;played to her the ma&s;ter-piece of narrative, in the laughable &s;cene of Par&s;on ADAMS pur&s;ued by the hounds and hunters. She was proof even again&s;t this, and
<PB N="124" REF="016020_0123_0F9B2909737E2CB8">
afforded it only a faint &s;mile. She then tried what a walk in the garden would do: &s;he cri|tici&s;ed the colours of the tulips, and de&s;canted with moral delicacy on the plea&s;ing progre&s;s of vegetable Nature; but, alas! even here a &s;igh would break in upon her remark, and very e|vidently convince me, that Pope was not &s;o ro|mantic in the pa&s;toral &s;entiment, which ob|&s;erves, <Q>Ab&s;ence is &s;urely death to tho&s;e who love.</Q> In &s;hort, SEDLEY, whatever might be the temptation before me, and however a&s;|&s;iduous I was to gratify it, it was not now the moment to begin the attack; and every thing I &s;aid, only &s;erved to &s;hew me more plainly, that, if I would wi&s;h to plea&s;e her, it mu&s;t be by warmly talking of a man, whom it was my in|tere&s;t to wean from her affections. Perceiving this, I gave way to &s;ympathy, and mo&s;t cordi|ally united <HI>my</HI> tears to <HI>hers,</HI> and joined in the mo&s;t animated encomiums on her happy Lieu|tenant. The&s;e tears, however, SEDLEY, and tho&s;e prai&s;es, gave me a &s;oothing &s;oftne&s;s not to be de&s;cribed, and made me feel a thou&s;and times more agreeable than while I repre&s;&s;ed them, in the hope of turning my thoughts to the hu&s;band's di&s;honour, and the wife's de&s;truc|tion. Is not this, SEDLEY, a parallel ca&s;e to that of thine? If thou wert more happy at
<PB N="125" REF="016020_0124_0F9B290AD30D1340">
doing a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> action to thy bath-maid, than an <HI>unju&s;t</HI> one, by <HI>undoing</HI> the lively HARRIET; I am more happy at having conquered an incli|nation, which would have tormented my own fancy, tortured a "generous, tru&s;ting friend," and agonized the bo&s;om of a woman, who&s;e reputation is at pre&s;ent un&s;u&s;pected, and un|polluted.</P>
<P>Hence then, my dear SEDLEY, it appears, that we are now both exulting in the triumph of a &s;imilar &s;en&s;ation&mdash;a &s;en&s;ation created by the &s;ocial virtues, and derived purely from the felicity of others. Upon this &s;ubject I have but one point to ob&s;erve: it is, to <HI>continue</HI> the tri|umph. Let us even cheri&s;h a tran&s;port, which is &s;uperior to any that di&s;&s;imulation can give: let us throw away the perplexing ma&s;k of the ca&s;ui&s;tical CHESTERFIELD: let us walk in the <HI>right</HI> way: and, &s;ince it hath already <HI>rewarded</HI> us &s;o well, let us prefer truth to fal&s;hood, and hone&s;ty to hypocri&s;y: for, believe me, my dear, dear SEDLEY, under whatever name we may di&s;tingui&s;h vice and virtue, they remain eter|nally the &s;ame; and neither &s;ophi&s;try, nor &s;ub|tlety, nor fa&s;hion, nor the &s;anctified follies of the mode, can po&s;&s;ibly palliate the atrociou&s;ne&s;s of the one, or detract from the native excellence of the other. PENMEN may puzzle, PHILOSO|PHERS

may refine, POETS may colour, and vi&s;ionaries may &s;ugge&s;t as they plea&s;e, but, while the traces of Nature remain, virtue will be fair, and vice deformed; and, in my opinion, that man's maxims are extremely contradictory and fallible, who, in the <HI>&s;ame volume,</HI> nay, &s;ometimes in the <HI>&s;ame epi&s;tle,</HI> inculcates a deli|cate regard to <HI>moral</HI> character, and an attack upon tho&s;e human <HI>weakne&s;&s;es,</HI> from the hu|mouring of which (a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a proper mix|ture of well applied flattery) we are to prey upon each other, to prepare our&s;elves for deceit, and, if the &s;y&s;tem were general, introduce, by the&s;e means, even while we &s;anctify the mo&s;t dangerous delu&s;ions. For my part, SEDLEY, I tell thee again, and again, that I find a flaw in thy STANPHOPE, and &s;hall read him, for the future, with the eye of a &s;evere critic, and not an idolater&mdash;not a PHILIP SEDLEY.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. SEDLEY to THORNTON.</HEAD>
<HEAD>(Prior to his Receipt of the la&s;t Letter.)</HEAD>
<P>THE ceremony has been performed. I in|&s;i&s;ted on its being done in the face of the congregation: I gave THOMAS a pur&s;e for his wedding dinner, and &s;o the poor wench is again made a mighty hone&s;t woman.</P>
<P>Never heard I panegyrics more warm, or <HI>bet|ter circulated</HI> than tho&s;e reverberated from lip to lip upon this occa&s;ion; and I could almo&s;t ble&s;s the fellow for a debauch, that hath added &s;uch lu&s;tre to my character. I am the very heroic ballad of the bath; and the negligence, which I <HI>&s;eem</HI> to pay to the prai&s;es, only &s;erves to encrea&s;e, and make me appear more de&s;erv|ing of them. But what a &s;impleton I was, to yield to the baby &s;en&s;ation which &s;eized me, unawares, in my la&s;t. To do good is, indeed <HI>plea&s;ing,</HI> and I will on that principle <HI>continue</HI> to do it, as occa&s;ion invites; but is there not an higher motive, thou wilt &s;ay, than this? Is there not religion? P&s;haw!&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, pious THORNTON, there <HI>is</HI> a higher motive. I am determined to do as much good
<PB N="128" REF="016020_0127_0F9B290CB81F7E20">
as is nece&s;&s;ary. It flatters the &s;en&s;es, it gratifies vanity, it procures <HI>eclat,</HI> it promotes conque&s;t, it extends our triumph over a &s;ex that was born for our amu&s;ement.&mdash;The trifling action ju&s;t recorded, backed by a few more that I have not patience to recite, hath made me &s;o popular among&s;t all ranks of people in this village, from my Lady in her bathing-&s;hift, to her tawdry attendants of the towel, that defy any-thing but my own folly, to mark me down an object of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>I have e&s;tabli&s;hed my reputation, THORN|TON, upon the &s;olid ba&s;is of <HI>virtuous actions;</HI> I have decorated the &s;uper&s;tructure, with the graces of conduct; and now, no man will <HI>dare</HI> to imagine this goodly edifice is but a <HI>whitened</HI> &s;epulchre. If he doth, men, women, and children, &s;hall defend me. Po&s;&s;ibly thou may&s;t imagine, that I have earned my plea&s;ures by <HI>difficult</HI> adoption of the STANHOPEAN &s;y&s;tem. No, THORNTON, I have a ta&s;te for them. I do not <Q>inflict exce&s;&s;es upon my&s;elf, becau&s;e I think them genteel,</Q> but I find the&s;e pur|&s;uits "guard me again&s;t frivolou&s;ne&s;s," and prevent me <Q>from throwing away upon tri|fles, that time, which only important things, de&s;erve.</Q> In a word, I tell thee once more,
<PB N="129" REF="016020_0128_0F9B290DF9CC3FD8">
I view the Lord of my idolatry only as a man earlier &s;killed than my&s;elf, in the arts of being <HI>truly</HI> and triumphantly happy: and in this light he de&s;erves my everla&s;ting gratitude; for he hath taught me <Q>to make every place I go to, the &s;cene of quick and lively tran&s;ports; to let every company I frequent, gratify my <HI>pa&s;&s;ions;</HI> to know the true value of time; and to &s;natch, to &s;eize, and to <HI>enjoy,</HI> every moment.</Q></P>
<P>Of this enough: the remainder of my letter &s;hall be dedicated to the delicious purpo&s;e of recording &s;everal events, which have fallen out, by the joint effort of de&s;tiny and contri|vance, &s;ince my la&s;t.</P>
<P>I have had a &s;econd glance at the delicate but decaying features of FANNY. Tempted by the chearfulne&s;s of the morning, &s;he ven|tured, under the &s;upporting arms of a hu&s;band, and &s;i&s;ter,&mdash;fair, fragile creature,&mdash;to walk from her lodgings to the bathing-hou&s;e. She &s;aw me, but drew away her eye, and never di|rected it towards me again. Her hu&s;band bowed to me, as to the polite &s;tranger, who had intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o in the welfare of his be|loved: the &s;i&s;ter inclined her head, and curt|&s;ey'd <HI>more</HI> than civilly&mdash;it was the bend, ra|ther

of attention, than ceremony. It was, altogether, a &s;hort, &s;oft, &s;ilent &s;cene, fit for a Deity to behold. But it was interrupted; for at this moment, many a lank-haired &s;wain, yet humid with the bath, and a clu&s;ter of wo|men, &s;till glowing from the immer&s;ion, ap|peared in view. They were in&s;tantly attracted by the pa&s;&s;ing meteor, gazed, envied, and went on. Well, indeed, <HI>might</HI> they gaze&mdash;well might they envy, THORNTON: the ro&s;e again emulates the lilly, in her cheek: the blue is like the blue of the elements: her arm, is ani|mated alaba&s;ter; and the hand, to which it be|longs, is &s;haped, by the Divinity of woman, to <HI>in&s;pire,</HI> by its appearance, and ENFEVER by its touch.</P>
<P>[I defy Dictionaries, and will create words when I think proper&mdash;I &s;ay again&mdash;<HI>enfever.</HI>]</P>
<P>After this, as &s;he was preparing to return, a &s;ervant came ha&s;tily to inform Mr. MORTI|MER, that Sir HENRY DELMORE was arrived. They quickened their pace a little; the nerves of &s;urpri&s;e were &s;haken; FANNY attempted to &s;tep bri&s;kly; but failed in the effort. The good Baronet, impatient, and eager to behold his children, came forward in his boots to meet them. They met. My heart bounded&mdash;I know not the rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="016020_0130_0F9B290F12CCF918">
Oh, THORNTON, what a figure is the Knight! how noble!&mdash;how venerable!&mdash;how fa|&s;hionable!&mdash;But, alas! all &s;urprizes, even tho&s;e of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing kind, are too much for the feeble &s;ituation of FANNY. Her fa|ther &s;oon &s;aw her confu&s;ion, &s;oftened it by a paternal ki&s;s, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in conducting her gently to her lodgings. In &s;omething le&s;s than an hour, I received the inclo&s;ed; which is the luckie&s;t incident in the world to me, and which, by the time this reaches you, I hope to improve to <HI>&s;ome plea&s;urable purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Li&s;ten, now, to ill-luck&mdash;HARRIET HOMESPUN is fonder of me, and better bred to Horace than ever. She has a wonderful apti|tude to learn, and will in time be, no doubt, a female STANHOPE. Yet &s;he mu&s;t not be too fond&mdash;Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>over-much,</HI> is treacherous.

<P>WHAT an additional degree of happine&s;s do I feel, &s;ince I la&s;t wrote to my be|loved Lady LUCY! My father is arrived, my &s;i&s;ter is recovering, and we are become ac|quainted with a man who&s;e company is at once plea&s;ing, in&s;tructive, and various. The very gentleman, my dear LUCY, who hath &s;o fre|quently
<PB N="138" REF="016020_0137_0F9B291434BFA598">
&s;ent his polite cards of enquiry con|cerning FANNY, proves to be a man of birth, rank, and character, and well known both to Sir HENRY, and Mr. MORTIMER, when they were la&s;t &s;ea&s;on at the bath of SCARBOROUGH. He is the mo&s;t well bred and complai&s;ant cha|racter in the world, and has, at the fir&s;t inter|view, all the ea&s;e, firmne&s;s, and unembarra&s;&s;ed air of an old acquaintance. The a&s;&s;ured, yet mode&s;t manner with which he pre&s;ents him&s;elf to a company, &s;hews plainly that he has been long accu&s;tomed to fa&s;hionable &s;ocieties, and would charm you. If FANNY continues to recover, we &s;hall be once more a joyful family&mdash;my mother is al&s;o down with us.</P>
<P>We have taken part of a very elegant hou&s;e, only a &s;hort ride from the company, about three miles di&s;tant from BUXTON, and it &s;tands upon a &s;pot infinitely le&s;s bleak and barren than the uncomfortable looking mountains that &s;urround the bath. I received the welcome epi&s;tle, dear LUCY, in which you enjoin me to fill up the interval of ab&s;ence, in a corre&s;pondence of wi&s;|dom, wit, &s;entiment, and affection; but does not my fair friend forget that the requi&s;ites to form and to continue &s;uch an intercour&s;e, are not at the command of every &s;cribbler, though the partiality of nature, and the poli&s;h of high|breeding,
<PB N="139" REF="016020_0138_0F9B2915755EB458">
may confer them on her&s;elf? How|ever, &s;ince you are &s;o earne&s;t with me, I will pour out my &s;oul imperfectly upon paper; and though I may be wanting in point of elegance or accuracy, the deficiencies will be compen|&s;ated by a frankne&s;s of mind, and an undi&s;gui&s;e of &s;entiment, that will pay a better compliment to my LUCY'S candour, than all that could po&s;&s;ibly be be&s;towed by the flowers of rhetoric, or colourings of the imagination.</P>
<P>I the more readily yield to your urgencies, my LUCY, as my pen, at this period, can only be the intelligencer of a felicity at once virtu|ous and endearing.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, indeed, that mankind have always &s;ome fanta&s;tical and vi&s;ionary &s;cheme in view. I declare to you, Lady SAXBY, that the perfect re&s;toration of FANNY'S health is the only drop that could now be added to the cup of our do|me&s;tic joy. Judge your&s;elf! for the vi&s;ible al|teration of Mrs. MORTIMER for the better, hath put me into &s;uch &s;pirits, that I cannot re&s;train my gratitude to the dear per&s;onage by which tho&s;e &s;pirits are in&s;pired. Take then, my beloved LUCY, the &s;ketch of a family|picture, drawn (and yet not partially) by the pencil of a relation.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="016020_0139_0F9B2915E306EB40">
The fir&s;t, and principal figure in this group is, a father, who&s;e mind is the repo&s;itory of e|very virtue&mdash;a repo&s;itory in which he has been, from hour to hour in the career of almo&s;t three&s;core years, laying up &s;omething valuable, till he hath at length &s;tored it with every ex|cellence; with all, LUCY, that can give worth to the hu&s;band, &s;oftne&s;s to the parent, &s;olidity to the friend, benevolence to the neighbour, and humanity to the man: to which is added, a univer&s;al attention to the wants and com|plaints, the fortunes, and morals of that prodi|gious body of men to which he is related only by &s;amene&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and the con&s;cious ties of the chri&s;tian and fellow-creature.</P>
<P>The &s;econd leading object in the piece is a mother, the model of her hu&s;band; and differ|ing only, by adapting the manly virtues to a de|licacy more con&s;i&s;tent with the refinement and gentlene&s;s of the female character, and nature.</P>
<P>The third figure, to which I would direct your ob&s;ervation, is, the &s;till lovely FANNY MORTI|MER,&mdash;a woman whom even the depredations of four lingering months, pa&s;&s;ed in the lan|guors of &s;ickne&s;s, have not rendered unat|tracting. To a &s;pirit at once wi&s;e and worthy, &s;he &s;uperadds the fine&s;t politene&s;s, gentlene&s;s uncommon, and meekne&s;s peculiar to her: and
<PB N="141" REF="016020_0140_0F9B291888854A28">
to the&s;e, again, are joined a ta&s;te elegant and &s;imple&mdash;an under&s;tanding enlarged and culti|vated,&mdash;and a face, in defiance of di&s;temper, in which Heaven &s;eems to have painted an at|tribute in every feature: her eyes &s;parkles be|nignity, her lips are the temples of truth, her cheeks are the emblems of mode&s;ty veiled in ro&s;es, and her hands were formed by the Graces to the be&s;t of purpo&s;es&mdash;to charm, by their liberality, the wretched into peace, and to be (con&s;i&s;tently with their colour) the pure and beautiful &s;tewards of a heart tender as a tur|tle's, yet &s;olid as a &s;age's.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band of this enchanting creature, is the brother of Lady SAXBY, the very counter|part of his &s;i&s;ter, and the very youth whom Sir HENRY DELMORE adopted as the child of his affection, undertook for &s;everal years the di|rection of his education, &s;upplied the lo&s;s of a father, trained him up for his own, and at la&s;t gave him, all-accompli&s;hed, to the only wo|man that could de&s;erve him&mdash;his <HI>daughter.</HI> His character is recorded in mo&s;t of the Euro|pean courts; and it is but a mere reverberation of a familiar echo for <HI>me</HI> to &s;ay, that he has been every where di&s;tingui&s;hed, for bravery without ra&s;hne&s;s, honour without ance&s;tral
<PB N="142" REF="016020_0141_0F9B2918AF250FB0">
pride, elegance without vanity, affection with|out intere&s;tedne&s;s, and genero&s;ity without o|&s;tentation.</P>
<P>Such, LUCY, are the outlines of a picture now under the eye of your friend. Your ab|&s;ence, however, and FANNY's uncertain &s;tate of health, are the two dark clouds that overca&s;t my otherwi&s;e radiant horizon.</P>
<P>In &s;ome mea&s;ure, however, to atone for the&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ible draw backs, I can now promi&s;e an often-repeated intercour&s;e, in which, through the kind medium of the po&s;t, our plea&s;ures, with tho&s;e of our families, &s;hall be reciprocated&mdash;But&mdash;in the name of extravagance, where am I a rambling&mdash;and what a metaphorical rhap&s;ody am I going to &s;end?

<P>I prithee, THORNTON, mark my policy, to which I have, even at the age of thirty, &s;acri|ficed my <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI>&mdash;pa&s;&s;ion which is equally de|&s;tructive of plea&s;ure and bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I have put my&s;elf in training, and am as temperate as a &s;aint&mdash;You &s;hall judge. Knowing the little fugitive &s;candals and whi&s;pers of a watering|place, I practi&s;ed upon my&s;elf the STAN|HOPEAN &s;elf-denial, and have not been a &s;ingle minute <HI>alone</HI> with HARRIET &s;ince the de|parture of HORACE. To prevent this I con|trive to call in, either the loquacious landlord, or chattering landlady; and have only conver&s;ed in their own way, upon topics, which, though important at the moment, are yet too trivial to &s;end <HI>thee</HI> one hundred and &s;ixty miles: they an&s;wered very well my purpo&s;e&mdash;I &s;ay well: for &s;trange as it may &s;eem to thee, I hold it not good policy, or right rea&s;on, nor con&s;onant to CHESTERFIELDISM, to have <HI>tete-a-tetes</HI> with a wife, when the hu&s;band is known to have left the town; nor am I&mdash;mark the &s;troke&mdash;very well plea&s;ed with the incautious HAR|RIET,

for &s;uffering her&s;elf to be de&s;erted, and expo&s;ed to the report, and <HI>murder</HI> of the mo|ment. In the&s;e places detraction is a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> filler-up of the vacuum;</P>
<L><HI>"At ev'ry word a reputation dies."</HI></L>
<P>The death of reputation is the death of my &s;ort of gallantry. I would not be thought a libertine, either in thought, word, or deed, for the univer&s;e. 'Tis expre&s;sly, and flagrantly a|gain&s;t my SYSTEM, which places, thou know|e&s;t, the very perfection of human nature, and the height of human abilities, in "being upon our <HI>own</HI> guard, and yet, by a <HI>&s;eeming</HI> natural openne&s;s, to put people <HI>off theirs.</HI>" Oh, exqui|&s;ite, exqui&s;ite arguer!&mdash;"A &s;econd DANIEL, THORNTON; a &s;econd DANIEL!"</P>
<P>Now, in ca&s;es of amour, it is, in conformity to this principle, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that, a hu&s;band &s;hould be upon the premi&s;es, though not upon the &s;pot; otherwi&s;e there is no po&s;&s;i|bility of avoiding my&s;tery; beware of that: my&s;tery occa&s;ions &s;u&s;picion, &s;u&s;picion opens a door to detection, and detection ruins me for|ever.

<HI>"He talks of tran&s;ports that he never knew,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And fancies raptures that he never felt."</HI></L>
<P>But the pupils of CHESTERFIELD are not &s;uch "rude, vain-glorious, boa&s;ters." <HI>They</HI> are to pre&s;erve their moral &s;anctity, even in the mid&s;t of (what gown&s;men call) violation: they are to be, not only of good report, but, like the pu|rity of Cae&s;ar's wife, un&s;u&s;pected.

<P>Oh! may this ingenuity and well-acted di&s;|&s;imulation ever keep me, THORNTON, from being blown upon; and, to this end, may I never withdraw the deep and dear veil that keeps me <HI>apparently</HI> pure, one moment from my heart! May I ever po&s;&s;e&s;s the ingenuous exterior, with the re&s;erved interior; may I ne|ver reject, as trouble&s;ome, or u&s;ele&s;s, the ma&s;|tery of my temper; and, above all other things, may I always po&s;&s;e&s;s my&s;elf enough to hear, and &s;ee, every thing, however anxious, how|ever agonizing, without any vi&s;ible, change of countenance!

<HI>other</HI> heart in the univer&s;e, and, to conclude my prayer, which I here fervently addre&s;s to the &s;pirit of STANHOPE, let hypocri&s;y place before me her &s;hield, of beautiful deception, under which I may fight <HI>my</HI> fooli&s;h antagoni&s;t, for ever guarded, and for ever victorious!</P>
<P>The&s;e little effu&s;ions that bur&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;|ly from the &s;oul, thou mu&s;t pardon, THORN|TON: they are the fiats of the God&mdash;But I de|&s;cend again to the mortal corre&s;pondent.</P>
<P>I perceive the adroite&s;t practice of the &s;everal points &s;ugge&s;ted by the matchle&s;s DORMER, will be &s;hortly nece&s;&s;ary; for never did I enter &s;o &s;agacious, or &s;o uniformly amiable a family as that of the DELMORES. I mu&s;t mu&s;ter all my forces. The whole family is a <HI>fortification</HI> again&s;t a Pupil of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The principal of it (Sir HENRY) is &s;o acute, &s;o adorned, &s;o read, and &s;o experienced, that <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t, I perceive, be deceived with a delicacy beyond the deceptions of Belial: and much wonder I opened not my&s;elf to his penetrating di&s;covery when at SCARBOROUGH; at a time too, when I was a novice in the ways of STANHOPE, and could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to <HI>copy him liberally.</HI> But, my good genius pre&s;erved

<P>Lay down the paper a moment to bow in reverence to my greatne&s;s! Do&s;t thou not &s;hrink in the compari&s;on? To proceed&mdash;There's a formidable hu&s;band too in my way&mdash;no HORACE HOMESPUN&mdash;but a man of travel, experience, ta&s;te,&mdash;a &s;econd &s;i&s;ter too&mdash;the lively DELIA&mdash;a wit, a corre&s;ponder, a perfect pen-woman; ready, rapid, an a&s;ker of whys and wherefores: and to clo&s;e the li&s;t, a venerable matron&mdash;wi&s;e&mdash;virtuous&mdash;&s;edato&mdash;penetrating&mdash;the lady pre&s;ident of this bewitching a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are in battle array again&s;t me&mdash;my &s;ingle &s;elf&mdash;formidable PHALANX! Give me joy! If they are not ver&s;ed (as I <HI>believe</HI> they are not) in my maxims, I may be a match for all them; pa&s;s like a meteor, through this difficult hemi&s;phere&mdash;kindle as I go&mdash;and dread no radiant competitor.

&s;urvive detection&mdash;&s;hould not blu&s;h to ac|knowledge me in ely&s;ium. Oblivion to your Ifs, for ever!</P>
<P>As to HARRIET&mdash;the affair is over: no|thing is left even for the exerci&s;e of my talents: the precept by which I obtained her, has been <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> in practice: all that remains, is ITE|RATION. Pa&s;&s;ion hath not a &s;ingle provoca|tive, to keep the pul&s;e a-beating. Her fond|ne&s;s grows luxuriant, and &s;he may betray me. She mu&s;t be checked. To confe&s;s the truth, THORNTON&mdash;I am indifferent to her, and I wi&s;h HORACE had her, locked in his arms to eternity, with all my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Am not I the mo&s;t generous man exi&s;ting?</P>
<P>At all events, &s;he mu&s;t not entertain &s;uch ardent expectations&mdash;for&mdash;I am &s;ummoned <HI>el&s;ewhere</HI>&mdash;a &s;cene of greater difficulty, great|er delicacy, and, therefore, of greater delight, expands it&s;elf before me.&mdash;The half-con|quered&mdash;half-expiring FANNY MORTIMER, who mu&s;t not de&s;cend, unenjoyed by SEDLEY, to the earth&mdash;The worm, THORNTON, mu&s;t not be &s;uffered to riot in her beauties: 'twould be a pity&mdash;a profanation!

am called to the combat&mdash;a combat, where the laurels will be trebly precious, &s;ince I per|ceive they mu&s;t be earned with all the artillery of manner, addre&s;s, a&s;&s;urance, and CHESTER|FIELDISM.</P>
<P>Every nerve mu&s;t be exerted!</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the&s;e objects, however, I &s;hall probably, be often &s;o animated as to <HI>wi&s;h</HI> enjoyments, that, it may be impolitic, to pu&s;h <HI>too far:</HI> every thing is ripe for the <HI>coup de grace.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;uch exigencies, it is difficult to keep the tight rein in my hand: the warmth of imagina|tion,&mdash;that enemy to all political decorum,&mdash;and an acquaintance with objects, and &s;itua|tions, calculated to &s;et it on fire, &s;eem incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the nece&s;&s;ary coolne&s;s, collection, and command of one's temper. To provide, there|fore, again&s;t the&s;e moments of ardour, I &s;hall, if LA MOTTE comes down, retain the ena|moured HARRIET in my &s;uit, as the agreeable <HI>re&s;ource</HI> from agitations into which, it is likely, I &s;hall be thrown by the charms, delays, or delicious impediments, of the DELMORES.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly, too, &s;omething may fall out to re|duce LA MOTTE, which, be her per&s;onal en|dowments what they may, is de&s;irable; becau&s;e
<PB N="150" REF="016020_0149_0F9B292222A59548">
&s;he is <HI>prepared</HI> to &s;u&s;pect my principles, and, therefore, will engage my more &s;erious atten|tion, till &s;he &s;hall have little rea&s;on to ridicule; or laugh at her friend. That woman is worth &s;ubduing, THORNTON, though &s;he were a JE|ZEBEL. Thy friend is an admirable leveller. I hate pride.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, if this LA MOTTE does <HI>not</HI> move, at the injunction of HORACE, nor at the pretended penitence of the letter|loving HARRIET; and, by tho&s;e means, HAR|RIET &s;hould be left to <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t ab&s;o|lutely return to the bo&s;om of the poor pedant, and I will a&s;&s;uredly &s;acrifice the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her per&s;on, to the unblemi&s;hed &s;ecurity of <HI>my</HI> character, which, I am aware, mu&s;t inevitably &s;uffer, by being avowedly the cici&s;beo of a wife, little di&s;tingui&s;hed among&s;t the bathers and bibbers of fa&s;hion. Yes, my friend, &s;he mu&s;t be, in that ca&s;e, turned over to the prie&s;t, tho', I were to fami&s;h for the ble&s;&s;ings of beauty.</P>
<P>If, indeed, &s;he had been ble&s;&s;ed with a fallow dam&s;el for a <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> or pale-faced prudent gen|tlewoman for her <HI>aunt,</HI> it might have been a|nother matter: but I again repeat it to you, that in a place like this, in &s;uch a &s;neaking, inqui&s;itive country as that of Britain, it is, to

all intents and purpo&s;es, requi&s;ite, for the &s;ecu|rity of my SYSTEM, that there &s;hould be &s;ome third per&s;on in a family, by the way of &s;creen; and rather than have our mi&s;tre&s;&s;es alone, that is, <HI>unprotected</HI> by &s;ome o&s;ten&s;ible he, or &s;he, that may be, or <HI>appear</HI> to be, an&s;werable for them in the pari&s;h where they vi&s;it, or where they re&s;ide, it is better for <HI>our</HI> plan of action, that we be &s;heltered, under the withered wing of a maiden cou&s;in of a century's &s;tanding, or even of the great grandmother her&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now, THORNTON, for a word or two on thy <HI>own</HI> affairs. If thou ha&s;t not, by this time, &s;urmounted the ticklings of thy con|&s;cience, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that tender te|nement, which thy friend the Lieutenant left to thee, then de&s;erve&s;t thou to be for ever di&s;|carded. A coward in love!&mdash;Oh, abomin|able!&mdash;Retrieve thy&s;elf, I charge thee!</P>

<P>You do me but ju&s;tice in &s;uppo&s;ing that I will keep your unhappy &s;ecret, as you very properly call it; for it is no &s;mall infelicity to make a &s;ecret of any &s;ort nece&s;&s;ary to the fame of a woman, and the peace of a whole family, who&s;e connections would all be di&s;honoured by a <HI>di&s;clo&s;ure.</HI></P>

As far, therefore, as my &s;ilence can contri|bute to your dome&s;tic tranquillity, you may depend upon me; though I cannot but think, &s;he who hath confidence enough to abu&s;e her hu&s;band, &s;hould have policy enough to conceal the particulars of her crime from a confidant; and I know not whether the very knowledge of &s;uch circum&s;tances, is not an in&s;ult to her virtue.</P>
<P>Your poor hu&s;band gave us, ye&s;terday, as u&s;ual, an admirable di&s;cour&s;e. There was in it &s;ome &s;oftening &s;entiments relating to the pure plea&s;ures of married felicity, which I could not but imagine were &s;ugge&s;ted by his own &s;ituation: he loves you, <HI>Harriet,</HI> mo&s;t fondly, and I could not avoid giving to &s;enti|ments, which I connected with certain others, the tribute of a tender tear. All the pari&s;hion|ers, and e&s;pecially the talkative part of them, expre&s;s their a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;ome by whi&s;pers, others by winks, and <HI>all</HI> by looks, or other ex|pre&s;&s;ive ge&s;tures, that Mrs. <HI>Home&s;pun</HI> &s;hould continue where &s;he has neither relations nor acquaintances. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that Mr. <HI>Home|&s;pun</HI> is the only un&s;u&s;picious per&s;on in the vil|lage; while <HI>he,</HI> wrapt up in the integrity of his &s;oul, and guarded by his good opinion of
<PB N="5" REF="016020_0157_0F9B292B31248160">
<HI>you,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es you will &s;oon regret his ab&s;ence, and return to him.</P>
<P>After &s;ervice he drank tea with me, and with tears in his eyes, fir&s;t urged my going to <HI>Bux|ton;</HI> then, (finding my refu&s;al e&s;tabli&s;hed) beg|ged I &s;hould, at lea&s;t, try the effect of my in|treaties to invite you back: he even went &s;o far as to hint, with all a <HI>father's</HI> glow upon his cheek, at the little nece&s;&s;ary preparations again&s;t the day in which you are expected to pre&s;ent him with a te&s;timoy of your truth and tenderne&s;s. There are various maternal cau|tions, &s;aid he, you know, my dear Mrs. <HI>La Motte,</HI> to be taken in &s;uch intere&s;ting &s;ituations; and, perhaps, the con&s;tant bu&s;tles of that wa|tering place, may for a while, lull to &s;leep, or rather agitate her into forgetfulne&s;s of tho&s;e cares that generally alarm the provident appre|hen&s;ion of <HI>her,</HI> who is in a <HI>very</HI> few weeks to be a mother.</P>
<P>The painting was too powerful. I ro&s;e to conceal my &s;ympathy, he pre&s;&s;ed me by the hand, in vi&s;ible di&s;order, and prote&s;ting that he left his fate to my management, &s;aluted me, in his hone&s;t way, and went to perform the la&s;t offices to a poor woman, <HI>(Alice Weldon)</HI> who

died la&s;t Wedne&s;day in child-bed of the babe, <HI>who&s;e father is not yet acknowledged.</HI> I told your hu&s;band, <HI>Harriet,</HI> I would exert my pow|er, without telling him that I had long lo&s;t my influence.</P>
<P>As you were not touched by <HI>my</HI> former let|ters, particularly <HI>one</HI> of them, I de&s;pair of mov|ing you by the pre&s;ent, having no new argu|ments to offer: nor &s;hould I, indeed, have troubled you at all, but that I did it, in com|pliance to your much injured, and my ever e&s;teemed friend, Mr. <HI>Home&s;pun,</HI> whom I ad|mire, chiefly, for the very &s;implicity, to which you made an objection. By the ardour with which he &s;peaks of that Mr. <HI>Sedley,</HI> upon all occa&s;ions, I perceive you have not been &s;e|duced by a novice, and yet, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly imagine how he has contrived to make the hu&s;band his friend, at the <HI>very</HI> time that he has betrayed the wife into the thorny paths of per&s;onal impurity. Be this at it may, he mu&s;t be a very artful creature, and, exclu&s;ive of my not going into the &s;ame lodging with the polluted <HI>Harriet,</HI> I do not choo&s;e to lay my&s;elf liable to the in&s;ult of being even the ri|dicule of a man, who, doubtle&s;s, <HI>a&s;per&s;es,</HI> even more than he <HI>de&s;troys.</HI></P>

It may not, however, be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, in conclu&s;ion, that, if your return to this place is not &s;peedy, it will probably be attended with con&s;equences, for which no after-penitence can po&s;&s;ibly atone.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXII. Mi&s;s Delia Delmore to Lady Lucy Saxby.</HEAD>
<P>FANNY is not wor&s;e, and therefore my &s;pirits, which always ri&s;e and fall with the pains and plea&s;ures of my friends, are equal to the delightful ta&s;k of corre&s;ponding with my dear Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>In my la&s;t I only &s;lightly, and in general terms, mentioned the patrons of my happine&s;s: let me now be more particular. My father has formed him&s;elf by &s;uch a &s;tandard, that his excellencies have a dignity peculiar to the dignity of his manners. He hath ever thought proper to include the friendly in the paternal character; and he inculcates, even to the low|e&s;t dome&s;tics, a certain &s;en&s;e of independency; a principle, he &s;ays, nece&s;&s;ary to be maintain|ed even among&s;t the lowe&s;t, and from which branches forth a thou&s;and virtues. In &s;ociety, &s;ays Sir <HI>Henry,</HI> &s;ubordination is certainly indi&s;|pen&s;ible, according to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem; but then, it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the balance, of human affairs is oftener, if not always, much more level than <HI>we</HI> imagine. If <HI>we</HI> feed the poor, their labour accommodates <HI>us:</HI> if we
<PB N="11" REF="016020_0163_0F9B292F33120920">
pay them for their toil, to that <HI>very</HI> toil we are indebted for all the &s;oftne&s;&s;es of pro&s;perity: if we provide them with a defence again&s;t the &s;everity of &s;ea&s;ons, and a chamber &s;o the con|venience of repo&s;e, (after they have wearied out their vigour in <HI>our</HI> &s;ervice,) let it be re|membered, that, in gratitude for our attention, to them we owe every thing which di&s;tingui&s;h|es riches from poverty: under their hands pro&s;|per the delicacies of the garden, and the trea|&s;ures of the field, the decorations of the man&s;i|on, and the table of plenty, the robe of luxury, and the bed of down.</P>
<P>Actuated by motives &s;o &s;ingularly noble, Sir <HI>Henry,</HI> at a proper cri&s;is, makes each of his children, in &s;ome &s;ort, independent, that is, my dear, he allots to each of us &s;uch a &s;hare of for|tune in our own hands as is &s;ufficient to the di&s;play and &s;hew-off of the natural di&s;po&s;ition. He e&s;teems it nece&s;&s;ary to know the operation of the temper, when it has power to play; this, &s;ays he, is not to be known by the common mode of contracting, but of extending; it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover any natural propen&s;ity, until opportunity gives liberty to all the little pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;tripling, and indulgence gives way to un&s;hackled inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="016020_0164_0F9B29301FC56858">
Educated under &s;uch advantages, and the fi|ner poli&s;hes of the &s;chool given by a father &s;o venerable and &s;uperior; the youthful indepen|dant will not turn to his honours, and the pre|cious depo&s;it entru&s;ted to him, to abu&s;e; and, if he does, even then there are many ways which Sir <HI>Henry</HI> has di&s;covered to turn his de|viating conduct into the proper channel. From kindne&s;s like this, Lady <HI>Lucy,</HI> we are enabled to do namele&s;s occa&s;ional little &s;ervices for the unfortunate; and by &s;uch means learn, early, to form our&s;elves into habits of &s;ympathy and tenderne&s;s of heart. I do not, &s;aid he, put gold into your pur&s;es, children, like &s;ome parents, who promi&s;e to double the &s;um, if you &s;hew it unbroken and undimini&s;hed, at a future period: I do not give it you to board up like mi&s;ers, nor to di&s;&s;ipate like little &s;pendthrifts; but I give it you on purpo&s;e to change into &s;mall &s;ilver; it is my de&s;ire that you &s;hould ta&s;te ear|ly the fir&s;t of plea&s;ures: look about you: it is a world of mi&s;ery, as well as impo&s;ition: mark your object to the be&s;t of your abilities, be de|ceived as little as po&s;&s;ible, and double your trea|&s;ure by decrea&s;ing it; &s;ix-penny worth of &s;ilver may gain &s;ixty moments of fair reflection: for the banquet at &s;o cheap a rate, provided to a|nother, the bread and water of gratitude, take
<PB N="13" REF="016020_0165_0F9B2930AE273368">
in exchange the richer fea&s;t of a kind heart: and in this ca&s;e, my dear children, which is the greate&s;t gainer? If you mu&s;t be u&s;urers, put your money out to &s;uch intere&s;t; be ambitious of laying it wi&s;ely out in the purcha&s;e of virtue, and I will &s;upply you chearfully with the means.</P>
<P>We were all walking, <HI>Lucy,</HI> the other morn|ing, by the &s;ide of the bath, when a &s;hort, bold, &s;turdy fellow acco&s;ted us for charity. We looked at Sir <HI>Henry</HI> for our cue: Come along, children, &s;aid he, that man is both impudent and able. As we pa&s;&s;ed by, the fellow drew up his mouth, and &s;haking a little dirty bag that he drew from his pouch, gingled it over his head, and triumphantly &s;napt his fingers. When we were at &s;ome di&s;tance: Take care, dea children, of &s;uch impo&s;tors: be&s;tow not the moment you are &s;upplicated: try the tem|per of the petitioner: he whom indigence, and the &s;trokes of ill fortune, have not at lea&s;t <HI>ha|miliated,</HI> is not <HI>yet</HI> an object of your genero&s;ity. As we were going to our carriage, a decayed veteran, in tattered regimentals, reduced to the knees by the perils of his profe&s;&s;ion, was en|deavouring to &s;weep our way with his hat: little <HI>Charles</HI> ran, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation,
<PB N="14" REF="016020_0166_0F9B2933E8B86870">
and gave his bounty. Yes, &s;aid Sir <HI>Henry, there,</HI> my dear lad, you could not be deceived: by whatever means brought about, &s;uch a poor wretch mu&s;t be the mark of liberality.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite, <HI>Lucy,</HI> to the maxims of the pre|&s;ent age, thus do our parents encourage us in proportion, as we have conduced to the hap|pine&s;s of others; and for every trifle well be|&s;towed, we are rewarded with a pre&s;ent four|fold its value, and that, again, enriched by a &s;mile, that &s;hews how &s;trongly the goodne&s;s of the child vibrates on the &s;en&s;ibility of the re|lation.</P>
<P>It is another happine&s;s peculiar to the re|treat of Sir <HI>Henry Delmore,</HI> that none of its re|&s;idents are fired by the envy of oppo&s;ition, or the meanne&s;&s;es of jealou&s;y: &s;o far the rever&s;e of this, that one is &s;tudious to compliment the other on &s;ome excellence fre&s;h acquired, or more perfected: &s;ome di&s;play of the heart, newly di&s;|covered, or &s;ome additional grace of the per|&s;on that blooms in the blu&s;h, &s;parkles in the eye, or dimples in the &s;mile.</P>
<P>What, my dear <HI>Lucy,</HI> can we &s;ay to tho&s;e who&s;e hearts, repugnant to &s;uch principles, turn a deaf ear to the mu&s;ic of dome&s;tic con|cord?

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Benefactor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GUESS how ea&s;ily your former favour &s;at upon my heart, by my readine&s;s to re|ceive from you another! I had more rea&s;ons than you yet know of for inviting you to my villa, and it was tho&s;e rea&s;ons that prevented me from inviting my <HI>Sophia</HI> to partake of the excur&s;ion. To tell you the plain truth, my friend, I have more policy than bu&s;ine&s;s in this excur&s;ion. I have lately had offers of prefer|ment: To &s;peak openly, I can have the com|mand of a company, upon joining General&mdash;, in <HI>America.</HI> The half-pay of a Lieu|tenant, you know, Sir, is not &s;ufficient to, even a man of moderation: my wife's private for|tune I have very &s;trickly &s;ettled upon her|&s;elf, as a &s;ort of comfortable &s;ecurity again&s;t unfortunate contingencies: I think my&s;elf no more intitled to touch the intere&s;t of this, than I would touch upon a property in tru&s;t, which, after my decea&s;e, was to be the only certain re&s;ource of the per&s;on under my guardian&s;hip. Another point is my own thir&s;t of glory. I was trained very early to the exerci&s;e of arms,
<PB N="34" REF="016020_0186_0F9B2947359EB710">
and although I continued to &s;tarve upon my en&s;igncy near twenty years, (I weep with joy, Sir, when I think upon the generous means by which I became a Lieutenant) yet the ardours of military ambition are by no means extin|gui&s;hed. I declare to you, Mr. <HI>Thornton,</HI> even ble&s;t as I now am in a competent income, pre|&s;ented to me with the hand of <HI>Sophia,</HI> in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion too, of <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf, I cannot, even at this time, hear the beat of a drum, without feeling my heart bound at the alarm. In a word, I de&s;ign to go to the field, and ac|cept the promotion. I am one of tho&s;e who &s;ide with that party which con&s;iders the dig|nity of Britain in&s;ulted by America. I was bred a &s;oldier, and taught even from my cra|dle (for my father had won his laurels) to feel all the delicacies of martial maje&s;ty. In my opinion, Sir, the Sovereign of the&s;e realms is in|jured: his injuries are mine: it is enough for a &s;oldier, to believe his cau&s;e is ju&s;t. I perceive many of my old comrades have voluntarily drawn the &s;word, while mine is gathering ru&s;t in its &s;heath. I drew it, Mr. <HI>Thornton,</HI> la&s;t night, out of the &s;cabbard, and upon examin|ing the blade I &s;aw a &s;pot, a lazy &s;pot of inac|tivity, de&s;troying the keenne&s;s of its edge. By
<PB N="35" REF="016020_0187_0F9B2948064C1B38">
my &s;oul, I felt my&s;elf blu&s;h at it; nor can I be ever ea&s;y, ever forgive my&s;elf, till I have at once wiped away the &s;hame, and the &s;pot, as it be|comes my &s;tation. Now then, Mr. <HI>Thornton,</HI> we are come to the point, a point of all others in the world the mo&s;t delicate. <HI>Sophia,</HI> my poor <HI>Sophia,</HI> mu&s;t, mu&s;t&mdash;Excu&s;e me, dear <HI>Thornton</HI>&mdash;excu&s;e a blot, which my weakne&s;s has, I &s;ee, made upon the paper: a tender wo|man will, at any time, un&s;oldier the bolde&s;t of us. But, fie upon it! fie upon it! it was the infirmity but of a moment: "I am a man a|gain." In &s;hort, Sir, my wife knows nothing of my intention, and I do not know how to break the matter with her. She has peculiar gentlene&s;s of heart, and will, I am convinced, feel the &s;evere&s;t pangs at parting. This is the fir&s;t time &s;ince our marriage that I have &s;lept from her &s;ide, and I wi&s;h much to know how &s;he has &s;upported it: if tolerably well, &s;he may, perhaps, be brought to bear the thoughts of a longer ab&s;ence; and, in that ca&s;e, I would have you gradually open the de&s;ign to her, of which, indeed, I di&s;tantly hint in my letter to her. The wor&s;t of it is, Mr. <HI>Thornton,</HI> women are &s;o apt to a&s;&s;ociate with the duty of a &s;ol|dier, &s;uch horrid ideas of death, broken bones,

groans, and cannon balls, that they give a man over the moment he marches from their em|braces to front the enemies of their country: however, let us not blame the &s;oftne&s;s that was de&s;igned to &s;oothe us, to &s;often us, to poli&s;h our ruggedne&s;s, and harmonize our natures. The drift of my letter is evident to you, <HI>Sophia</HI> mu&s;t know it: the &s;ummer is advancing: ma|ny of our troops are midway betwixt the con|tending countries: &s;ome of them are arrived at the theatre of the war. I have but a few days to &s;pare. Dalliances mu&s;t in no wi&s;e be in|dulged: they are too effeminating: I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf with them. My ab&s;ence is pro|pitious to the di&s;clo&s;ure. You are not un&s;kil|led in argument: you want not the advantages of per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence: to you, therefore, I tru&s;t the tranquillity of a wife's bo&s;om. In|&s;pire her, if po&s;&s;ible, my worthy Mr. <HI>Thornton</HI> with the duty &s;he owes to my character, which longer idlene&s;s would utterly obliviate.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXVI. Sedley to Thornton. (Before the Receipt of the above.)</HEAD>
<P>I FIND it impo&s;&s;ible to conquer the habits of loving, and communicating to thee my &s;en|timents. There is a philtre in an old friend|&s;hip that cannot ea&s;ily be de&s;troyed. Pardon my ra&s;h &s;ayings, therefore. Preach till thou art weary, and only allow me the liberty of repo&s;ing with thee all my enterprizes.</P>
<P>What cour&s;e I am to take in the pre&s;ent cri|&s;is, Heaven only can tell. Such an accident has happened as totally confounds me. In conformity to my promi&s;e, I di&s;patched <HI>Har|riet</HI> to the langui&s;hing pedant; but &s;he had &s;carce got, as I under&s;tand, five miles on her way, when the cur&s;ed po&s;tillion, willing to &s;hew his dexterity, (according to their villainous cu&s;tom) by driving like a devil through the village, at a &s;hort turn, or rather angle in the

road, overturned the chai&s;e, fell him&s;elf from the &s;addle, and &s;et the hor&s;es a-going, while the poor <HI>Harriet</HI> was dragged along the earth, with her body half out of the chai&s;e-window, till a countryman caught the off-hor&s;e by the bridle, and put a &s;top to the career. She was carried into a little dirty-looking inn, almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s; and, as &s;he informs me, with an arm torn by the gla&s;s, which was unfortunately drawn up, &s;cribbled an almo&s;t unintelligible line to reque&s;t I would ha&s;ten to &s;ee her before &s;he died. The po&s;t-boy brought me the note, and, trembling like a leaf, and white as a &s;hirt, prote&s;ting mo&s;t fervently that he could not help the accident. I knew not what to do: I he&s;itated, dreaded the con&s;equence; wrote a hurried line to poor <HI>Horace,</HI> without feeling either pen or paper; called for a taper, without thinking that I wanted wax; &s;ent it to the po&s;t by the boy; and then ordered my hor&s;es. The cur&s;ed landlord, who is ever alarmed at the &s;ound of a hoof, in the expectation of fre&s;h prey, now detected my di&s;order, and &s;et every wheel at work to find out the cau&s;e: "He was &s;orely &s;orry to &s;ee me unea&s;y; would do any thing in his power; hoped nothing material was the matter. Could he do any thing? he was concerned to &s;ee me in &s;uch confu&s;ion;

Some law-&s;uit, <HI>may be,</HI> had gone wrong, or <HI>&s;ommut</HI> or other was mo&s;t <HI>far|tinly</HI> the matter." My &s;ervant came with my hor&s;es to the door, and the per&s;ecutor began again: "Good lack, good lack, what can be the <HI>'ca&s;ion</HI> of this! Was I going away? Was I obliged to leave <HI>Buxton? Martha,</HI> where's the gentleman's little account? How &s;orry he was again!"</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>Thornton,</HI> I was obliged to e&s;cape <HI>him</HI> and my ri&s;ing rage, by ru&s;hing into a little &s;lip of ground behind his hou&s;e, where, under pretence of picking a few pinks that &s;traggled, poverty-&s;truck, about the beds, I ca&s;t about what was to be done. In this manner I argued with my&s;elf: If I go to <HI>Harriet,</HI> the affair will certainly be &s;u&s;pected: for how came I &s;o in|tere&s;ted in this lady's misfortune! If I do <HI>not</HI> go, it will be barbarous; but then I have &s;ent to her hu&s;band, and home is the be&s;t and fitte&s;t place for a &s;ick woman. Upon the whole, I thought it not proper or political to go; and, as to writing, I dare not give way to my &s;enti|ments, for a di&s;covered letter is irrecoverable

perdition. Upon my return into the hou&s;e, I found the ra&s;cally landlord tampering for intel|ligence with the po&s;tboy, who had come upon the &s;addle-hor&s;e with the tangled traces &s;till about his back: I had well nigh broke out a|gain. <HI>Thomas,</HI> who &s;tays with me, although married, till I can &s;uit my&s;elf, looked as if he &s;u&s;pected the matter. The landlord muttered forth a million pities, and talked of our being all mortal, and liable to accidents; the po&s;tboy &s;aid his hor&s;es were cut, as I &s;aw, all to pieces, and his chai&s;e &s;hattered in the pannels.</P>
<P>I could <HI>Stanhope</HI> it no longer: Cur&s;e your hor&s;es, chai&s;e and pannels, all together, &s;aid I: get out of my &s;ight, and leave me to my&s;elf: a lady is dying, and you are prating about your damn'd pannels. <HI>Tom,</HI> take away the hor&s;es.

<P>I would have gone in to write.</P>
<P>The landlord again &s;truck up: "Had not the lady better come back to my hou&s;e, Sir? The journey to Mr. <HI>Home&s;pun's</HI> will be too far in her pre&s;ent condition." Pray, Mr. <HI>Wyngood,</HI> &s;aid I, &s;uffer me to do as I plea&s;e. The man

exigencies. I find it nece&s;&s;ary to the peace of my mind to write to you. The acci|dent, Sir, that brought us together at <HI>Scarbo|rough,</HI> when your vi&s;its to me were very fre|quent, and, as a &s;ingle woman, I confe&s;s not di&s;agreeable, is recollected with &s;ome anxiety. You were then at &s;ome pains to convince me I had made an impre&s;&s;ion on your &s;en&s;ibility, and certain &s;entiments were interchanged, which it would be, at this period, highly im|proper to repeat. It may not be ami&s;s, how|ever, to ob&s;erve that, prior to your quitting <HI>Scarborough,</HI> you did not omit exerting your utmo&s;t talents (and they are not incon&s;idera|ble Mr. <HI>Sedley</HI>) to engage my heart. How far you &s;ucceeded, it is not <HI>now</HI> material to en|quire. Be that as it may, my health hath been gradually upon the decline from that hour to this. It is now &s;ome months &s;ince I gave my hand to Mr. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> than whom their ne|ver lived a better character, or a tenderer hu&s;|band. He was educated under the eye of my father, who &s;eemed &s;o wrapt up in the ideas of making him &s;till nearer to his family, that as he thought proper to addre&s;s me, I could not deny to duty, what po&s;&s;ibly I &s;hould have re|fu&s;ed to every thing el&s;e. In a word, Sir, my
<PB N="52" REF="016020_0204_0F9B27AC0FC640F8">
worthy father's heart was in the match, and it is impo&s;&s;ible for a child to di&s;appoint the wi&s;h|es of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a parent. The &s;oftne&s;s, delicacy, and gentlene&s;s of Mr. <HI>Mortimer</HI>'s behaviour has ever been uniform and exact: and al|though it has plea&s;ed Heaven to continue my indi&s;po&s;ition, and indeed rather to increa&s;e than abate it, yet he has not &s;uffered my languor to relax his animated a&s;&s;iduities, but has acted, both by day and by night, the double part of nur&s;e and hu&s;band. Peculiarly unlucky do I account the de&s;tiny by which you and I, Sir, meet again: not that I have the lea&s;t traces of affection for your per&s;on, being really attached to Mr. <HI>Mortimer</HI> by duty, and upon principle. At the &s;ame time, Sir, I cannot but own your pre&s;ence gives me unea&s;ine&s;s, and unea&s;ine&s;s of any kind I am not now equal to. You have, I &s;ee, recommended your&s;elf to my father more warmly than ever; my &s;i&s;ter thinks very high|ly of you: Mr. <HI>Mortimer</HI> is loud in your prai&s;es; and even my mother, who is not ea&s;i|ly attracted, &s;peaks of you with ardour. As my &s;ituation is &s;ufficiently &s;acred to exclude every po&s;&s;ible hope, nay, as I dare pre&s;ume your own connections have, by this time, led your inclinations into a more proper channel, I will venture to talk to you with the freedom
<PB N="53" REF="016020_0205_0F9B27AC306319A8">
of a friend. To &s;peak plainly, then, Mr. <HI>Sed|ley,</HI> there is a point in which you may &s;till oblige me, it is this: that you would enter as &s;eldom into this hou&s;e as is con&s;i&s;tent with a re&s;olution, which I earne&s;tly beg you will take, of withdrawing your&s;elf from this family. Do it lei&s;urely: but at all events, let it be done. Ah! Mr. <HI>Sedley,</HI> pity the perturbation of an un|ea&s;y mind. Before you came, I could at lea&s;t conceal agitation, and &s;ubmit to the &s;ilent de|predations of my di&s;temper. Every tear I then &s;hed, every &s;igh that then &s;tole from me, was attributed to the unavoidable ri&s;ings and &s;inkings of a com&s;umptive habit. But within the&s;e few days I have had &s;ome conflicts, and every one of them adds to my weakne&s;s, to hide&mdash;a &s;omething that preys upon my heart. To account to you for this is needle&s;s. If you have the lea&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion that it is occa&s;ioned by your appearance, let it intere&s;t your humanity, your honour, your compa&s;&s;ion, in my cau&s;e; and do not, Mr. <HI>Sedley,</HI> render more exqui|&s;itely wretched the la&s;t hours of a fate at the be&s;t unenviable, and not &s;u&s;tained without a &s;orrow that is ha&s;tening its object to the tomb.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXII. Mi&s;s Delia Delmore, to Lady Lucy Saxby.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY moment in the day affords &s;ome fre&s;h and beautiful in&s;tance of my noble father's wi&s;dom and affection. About an hour after tea this evening, while Sir <HI>Henry</HI> was en|joying his &s;erene &s;ummer-walk, as he calls it, <HI>William</HI> brought a pencilled card, and deliver|ed it to me. It was to advi&s;e with him (Sir <HI>Henry</HI>) about &s;ome concerns e&s;&s;ential to the general welfare. Even my little brother and &s;i&s;ter, <HI>Charles</HI> and <HI>Caroline,</HI> (who are down
<PB N="62" REF="016020_0214_0F9B27B53ACB3178">
with us) were mentioned in this invitation: the card reque&s;ted the company of all the fa|mily, adding, that as the evening was delight|ful, his mind compo&s;ed, and nobody but our|&s;elves, at pre&s;ent, in the hou&s;e, he much de|&s;ired that we might all have our &s;hare in the general &s;erenity. How prettily, my dear <HI>Lu|cy,</HI> how per&s;ua&s;ively, this exalted parent pro|po&s;es, as a plea&s;ure, what his authority might command as a duty! But it is among the num|ber of his excellent maxims, that none but fro|ward &s;pirits do well with compul&s;ion, and that a frank and ingenuous tenderne&s;s hath in it equal weight and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed in the garden, un|der the &s;hade of hawthorns, laurels, and fil|berts: there is a white bench under it; and a &s;ort of natural arching, bower-fa&s;hion, made by the mixture of thick leaves and branches interwoven above. Hither we came in obe|dience to the &s;ummons: a group of relations, loving and beloved. <HI>Fanny</HI> who had been a|mu&s;ing her&s;elf with the pen, (not having had &s;trength for the plea&s;ures of writing for &s;ome time) came forward, delicate as angel meek|ne&s;s, with her younger brother in one hand, and her little &s;i&s;ter in the other. <HI>Venus,</HI> with
<PB N="63" REF="016020_0215_0F9B27B8748849B8">
two of her attendant Graces, could not be more lovely, even though the di&s;tre&s;s of ill health threw &s;omewhat of languor into her air: but then it was a languor &s;o &s;oft, and a di&s;tre&s;s &s;o gentle, that it only &s;erved the more to <HI>feminine,</HI> (if you will allow the word), and to recommend her to the &s;pectator, as a more pathetic, intere&s;ting figure.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Henry</HI> was at fir&s;t &s;itting &s;omewhat pen|&s;ively, with an opened letter in his hand, my mother by his &s;ide, leaning her arm on one of the corners of the bench, and repo&s;ing her cheek within her hand, the true po&s;ture of me|ditation. They both ro&s;e at our approach. Mr. <HI>Mortimer</HI> and I went up fir&s;t; then <HI>Fan|ny,</HI> and her twin-cherubs: we were a little a|larmed, but this was &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated by Sir <HI>Henry,</HI> who &s;eating us all on the bench, drew a green garden-chair from an adjoining &s;hade, placing him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to us, and, with a &s;mile of ineffable benignity, in which the pa|rent and the friend &s;hone beautifully blended, he paid each of us a varied compliment, on our obedience to his wi&s;hes, and addre&s;&s;ed us to this effect:</P>
<P>"I have reque&s;ted your company, my dear and worthy children, to engage your filial at|tention
<PB N="64" REF="016020_0216_0F9B27B91AB5F3A0">
on &s;everal of the mo&s;t important events of human life: I have, indeed, for &s;ome time, had a de&s;ign to &s;ummon you together on this &s;ubject, but care, company, and amu&s;ement, have thrown their attractions or interruptions hitherto in the way of my wi&s;hes. I have, however, fixed upon this evening of lei&s;ure to deliver to you the &s;ecrets of my heart, and in mine are included tho&s;e of the be&s;t of wives, and tendere&s;t of mothers."</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Delmore</HI> drew her &s;pread fingers acro&s;s her face, and Sir <HI>Henry</HI> repeating his panegy|ric, went on:</P>
<P>"I am happy, my dear relatives, to tell you, in the fir&s;t place, and let that &s;erve as an en|couragement to you, that I can look back up|on a life of more than three&s;core years, with a tranquillity of retro&s;pect, at the &s;ame time &s;in|cere, chri&s;tian, and philo&s;ophic. The &s;erenity of my &s;oul is in no degree wounded by the cri|tici&s;m with which I review it's conduct thro' the perilous voyage of my life, in which, by the care of Heaven, I have e&s;caped tho&s;e quick|&s;ands that endanger our youth, and tho&s;e rocks which alarm us in age. But that which I ac|count far the riche&s;t indulgence of Providence,
<PB N="65" REF="016020_0217_0F9B27B9DDCF2E08">
is that dear pro&s;pect which I now behold in the per&s;ons of this beauteous circle, a circle filled with the pledges of this generous crea|ture's invariable fidelity, and the te&s;timonies of my con&s;tant attachment to excellences &s;o di&s;|tingui&s;hed."</P>
<P>My mother ro&s;e, <HI>Lucy</HI> gave her hand to Sir <HI>Henry,</HI> looked at him a moment, looked at him blooming even in age, &s;ighed &s;oftly, and returned to her &s;eat.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Henry</HI> proceeded:</P>
<P>"The &s;ea&s;on of infancy is pa&s;t with mo&s;t of you; and it's plea&s;ures are &s;ucceeded by re|flections of a higher nature. Even this &s;weet pair <HI>(here he pointed to my young brother and &s;i&s;|ter)</HI> are at the age of di&s;tingui&s;hing, and the te&s;t are mature. The blo&s;&s;oms of youth pro|mi&s;e a generous fruitage. You, <HI>Delia,</HI> have not yet been rewarded by the tenderne&s;s of &s;uch a man as my <HI>Mortimer:</HI> yet the colour of your life will depend on the exchange of your name. Your mother's expectations, like mine, are &s;anguine, and exten&s;ive: our eyes are turn|ed on your every action. We hope to &s;ee you all the &s;upports of our declining age: our &s;un is about to &s;et, and we wi&s;h it's departure may be gilded by your virtues and indulgencies.</P>

"The father of a family is at once a &s;ublime and venerable character. My full heart di|lates as I &s;ee my&s;elf encompa&s;&s;ed by the&s;e charming portraits of our&s;elves."</P>
<P>Here Lady <HI>Delmore</HI> melted into tears of tran&s;port, but endeavoured to conceal them.</P>
<P>"I can form to my&s;elf (continued my fa|ther) no ideas beyond it, nor many equal. Our family is at pre&s;ent the &s;eat of integrity, una|nimity, and mutual confidence. Our plea&s;ures are reflected upon each other, and we recipro|cally give and receive inimitable complacence. Yet we mu&s;t be alarmed for tho&s;e we love. Though the tenor of your conduct, and the gratitude of your tempers, make us le&s;s fearful of deviation, and though the maxims we have ever been indu&s;trious to inculcate make us more &s;ecure and inapprehen&s;ive, yet certain tremors will inevitably touch the bo&s;om of a parent: be not di&s;plea&s;ed therefore, my children, if I give you a few general precepts, for your e&s;tabli&s;h|ment and adoption. They come &s;anctified to you with the venerable imprimatur of more than fifty years experience. The maxims which are nece&s;&s;ary to regulate an ingenuous mind are neither multiplied nor intricate. The very corner-&s;tone of a great character is a clear con|&s;cience:
<PB N="67" REF="016020_0219_0F9B27BB5837E3E0">
if you feel well, you will act well: and if you do not, all the talents in the world will only &s;erve to torment you. Never wear a ma&s;k before your motives, but when it is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the felicity of life, &s;uch as deceiving, or rather bewitching, the unprinci|pled into virtue&punc; &s;ome tempers cannot bear the plain truth; &s;he is too awful for them: be it then, in &s;uch particular ca&s;es, your parts, to lead them to her &s;acred temple by the mo&s;t plea&s;ing paths. Alleviate the apparent rugged|ne&s;s, and length of the way, by &s;uch meanders as, though they &s;eem to deviate, may a&s;&s;uredly bring you, by the faire&s;t pro&s;pects, to the &s;hrine of the Godde&s;s. I have no objection to your adorning your&s;elves with all the attraction of exterior, &s;uch I mean as are reflected upon the character from dignity of manner, per&s;ua&s;ion of voice, &s;plendor of addre&s;s, and elegance of air:</P>

<P>They will act like magic, and make the inno|cence both of your &s;entiment and example, perfectly irre&s;i&s;table; and I be&s;eech you to ex|ert them in the cau&s;e of that truth and &s;obriety of heart I have recommended. Make u&s;e of them to conciliate differences, to in&s;pirit &s;ociety,

to embelli&s;h conver&s;ation, to &s;often the har&s;h|ne&s;s of di&s;pute, to animate attention; to plea&s;e, to in&s;truct, to entertain.

Con&s;cious of the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing idea, I availed my&s;elf of her partiality. I did not kneel, I did not whine, I did not &s;mack the palms, nor &s;queeze the handkerchief, but I hit her on the only chord of the &s;oul that could make a vibra|tion in my favour; I pitied her want of health, I prai&s;ed the &s;acrifice &s;he had made to paternal quietude. I was all refinement, all a&s;&s;iduity, all <HI>Che&s;terfield.</HI> The features were obedient, and every atom of irre&s;i&s;tible art was levelled again&s;t her.

<P>WHAT a dreadful change; my dear <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;ince I la&s;t wrote to you! There is an unu&s;ual degree of unea&s;ine&s;s on the counte|nances of my ever-honoured parents: my bro|ther, Mr. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> is pen&s;ive: <HI>Fanny</HI> was &s;eized with an hy&s;teric di&s;order, while her hu&s;band was communicating to me the di&s;|cour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mr. <HI>Sedley,</HI> who has never been at our hou&s;e &s;ince. Mrs. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> it &s;eems, knew not that Mr. <HI>Sedley</HI> had intere&s;ted her hu&s;band in the declaration made, by that medium, to me: &s;he remains exceedingly ill: has actually refu&s;ed to &s;uffer Mr. <HI>Mortimer</HI> to &s;leep with her: &s;ays, &s;he has &s;trong rea&s;ons for it, which he &s;hall know at a proper time.

I have no heart now, Lady <HI>Lucy,</HI> to talk of my own affairs; and yet, as you have a right to know every thing that concerns me, I ju&s;t &s;end you a &s;ketch of my brother's conver&s;ation in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, previous to the&s;e alarming circum&s;tances. My almo&s;t con&s;tant attend|ance on my &s;i&s;ter will not permit me to tran|&s;cribe it fair; and you mu&s;t be contented with a loo&s;e paper, on which I have been able to &s;cribble only at intervals.</P>
<P>[The Paper, inclo&s;ing Mr. <HI>Mortimer's</HI> Addre&s;s to his Si&s;ter, upon Mr. <HI>Sedley's</HI> Subject.]</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> having led me by the hand through the garden into the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, began, as u&s;ual, with a pretty compliment, told me, that he found I had already done execu|tion; that I had made a wound which all the waters of <HI>Buxton</HI> were not able to cure, and then proceeded (you know, <HI>Lucy,</HI> what an able advocate he is) to open the de&s;ign of his calling me a&s;ide. I will own to you, &s;aid he, my dear <HI>Delia,</HI> that I &s;ummon your attention in behalf of Mr. <HI>Sedley;</HI> but I will, as nearly as I am able, to recollect his own words, and, without the lea&s;t endeavour to &s;way you, leave the re&s;ult to your own determination. I lately
<PB N="96" REF="016020_0248_0F9B286AAF612298">
had a particular conver&s;ation with Mr. <HI>Sedley,</HI> wherein he addre&s;&s;ed me, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, as follows:</P>
<P>"The motive of this vi&s;it, Mr. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> is in confidence to enquire of you, from whom I have rea&s;on to believe &s;he conceals nothing, whether your &s;i&s;ter <HI>Delia</HI> is under any pre&s;ent engagement of heart, or in the lea&s;t re&s;pect partial to any one in the di&s;po&s;al of her affec|tions; for I &s;hould &s;hudder to be the cau&s;e of even a negative pain to &s;o amiable a woman: and I forbore to a&s;k this que&s;tion of Sir <HI>Henry,</HI> le&s;t that regard which he is plea&s;ed to entertain of me might incline him to &s;omething that might be contradictory to the private pro&s;pects of his daughter. I know, Mr. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> the fraternal affection your &s;i&s;ter bears you, and I am no &s;tranger, young as I am in your ac|quaintance, to the all-&s;ouled intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between you as happy relations: hence I ima|gined it more for the general peace to direct my&s;elf to you rather than any other: for as my enquiries are an&s;wered by <HI>you,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> I will either bury my ambitious wi&s;hes in my own and your bo&s;om, or, &s;hould they meet an encouraging reply, I will proceed to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;eem to you mo&s;t conducive to the happine&s;s I a&s;pire to."</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="016020_0249_0F9B286B6FF06A48">
Here, <HI>Delia,</HI> he pau&s;ed a little, and then, with inimitable grace, pur&s;ued his overtures:</P>
<P>"Although, Mr. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> &s;aid he, I have of late often had the honour of Sir <HI>Henry's</HI> company, who&s;e neare&s;t &s;ecrets of heart I am beginning to &s;hare, I never found that he had any view of uniting Mi&s;s <HI>Delmore</HI> to any parti|cular family. But why do I talk thus? Sir <HI>Henry</HI> &s;purns the bare idea of compul&s;itory connections, and his noble nature can never &s;toop to barter the felicity of a child to inter|e&s;ted pro&s;pects. And yet, Sir, may it not be rea&s;onably apprehended, that a &s;oul &s;o delicate, a heart &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible, feelings &s;o fine, and a bo&s;om &s;o alive to every nicer alarm, as Mi&s;s <HI>Delmore's,</HI> may have made &s;ome wi&s;e and fa|vourite choice of her own? If &s;o, tell me of it, frankly, and I promi&s;e, dear <HI>Mortimer,</HI> to join you in promoting, rather than oppo&s;ing, the happine&s;s &s;he hopes for. After what I have now &s;aid, you will be quite explicit, ingenu|ous, and unre&s;erved."</P>
<P>He waited my reply: his fine eyes &s;hone with expectation: I told him, that I believed my &s;i&s;ter <HI>Delia</HI> had not yet, among&s;t the vari|ous preten&s;ions made to her hand, &s;een the ob|ject &s;he could approve in the intimate light he
<PB N="98" REF="016020_0250_0F9B286C31C881C0">
alluded to; that I had often heard her expre&s;s a proper regard to the excellencies, manners, and addre&s;s of Mr. <HI>Sedley:</HI> that, as a very young friend, introduced into the family by the hand of &s;o reverend and &s;agacious a father, &s;he had an elegant opinion of his merit: and that, tho' I had not ob&s;erved the lea&s;t intimation of her entertaining any &s;en&s;ibility of <HI>heart</HI> as to his per&s;on, (here, <HI>Delia,</HI> he bowed and blu&s;hed) yet that (be not di&s;plea&s;ed, <HI>Delia</HI>) I knew her naturally &s;oft, &s;en&s;ible, and a nice di&s;tingui&s;her of &s;uperior endowments. I concluded with &s;aying, that for the &s;hort time I could boa&s;t the honour of his acquaintance, I knew none more likely to in&s;pire Mi&s;s <HI>Delmore;</HI> and that, as a proof of my good wi&s;hes, I would take the opportunity given me of Sir <HI>Henry</HI> and Lady <HI>Delmore's</HI> evening ride, from which I would excu&s;e us young folks, to inform you of the conver&s;ation previous to any farther procedure.</P>
<P>His cheeks coloured to their full bloom (and you know what a complexion he has, <HI>Delia</HI>) at this propo&s;al: he begged, with great delicacy, that, till I was pre-acquainted with your pro|po&s;als, wi&s;hes, and views, I would pre&s;erve the whole matter a &s;ecret, not only from your mother and Sir <HI>Henry,</HI> but even from my wife,
<PB N="99" REF="016020_0251_0F9B286CF19E4928">
the angelic Mrs. <HI>Mortimer,</HI> as he was plea&s;ed to call her: adding, that he could not bear to occa&s;ion, by an ill-timed petition, one mo|ment's unea&s;ine&s;s in a family &s;o harmonized, innocent, and affectionate, as Sir <HI>Henry Del|more's;</HI> and that, rather than be cruelly in&s;tru|mental in the &s;ubver&s;ion of this, although his heart was in the cau&s;e, he would &s;tifle the pleadings of it to eternity. I ea&s;ily prevailed, <HI>Delia,</HI> on Sir <HI>Henry</HI> and your mother, to ex|cu&s;e us, and, as &s;oon as their chariot rolled from the door, I took Mr. <HI>Sedley</HI> by the arm, and told him I was going to be his advocate. He pre&s;&s;ed my hand, and, in a whi&s;per, &s;aid he would have the honour to keep Mrs. <HI>Mor|timer</HI> company in the &s;aloon, while I pleaded for him in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And now, my dear <HI>Delia,</HI> continued my brother, may not I congratulate you on the conque&s;t of a man, who, if there is any faith in the faire&s;t appearances, is equally adorned in mind and body, and who will, I dare &s;ay, in|&s;tantly proceed to acquaint us with his circum|&s;tances and fortunes, if he receives your &s;anc|tion to be more explicit. I mu&s;t own I never was &s;o truly attracted by any man, and he real|ly &s;eems born for an alliance with a woman as

enchanting as him&s;elf. Tell me truly, tell me like a &s;i&s;ter, Did you ever &s;ee &s;o manly, yet &s;o decorated an addre&s;s? &s;uch &s;plendid &s;entiments, &s;o elevated an air? Or did you ever before meet with any gentleman &s;o ea&s;y, or &s;o engaging, in that &s;ort of behaviour which is the re&s;ult of a brilliant capacity, ornamented breeding, and unaffected complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>When you have read the inclo&s;ed, <HI>Lucy,</HI> give me the &s;entiment of your heart upon it: for my own part, flattering as it is, I am too di&s;ordered, and too much intere&s;ted in the &s;ud|den, gloom that hangs over our hou&s;e, to find &s;atisfaction in any thing. Yet I am always</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCIX. Lady Lucy Saxby to Mi&s;s Delia Delmore.</HEAD>
<P>HOW &s;hall I be able to write a proper an&s;wer to &s;o intere&s;ting a letter as your la&s;t, in which two &s;ubjects &s;o immediately oppo&s;ite are touched upon? As to poor Mrs. <HI>Mortimer's</HI> health, I anxiou&s;ly hope, &s;he is by this time, again re&s;tored to a more tolerable degree of it; and yet how much are you all to be pitied in being nece&s;&s;arily made the &s;pectators of a di&s;|po&s;ition &s;o full of fears, hopes, wi&s;hes, and ap|prehen&s;ions! But, as <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;ays, <Q>I dreamed a dream la&s;t night,</Q> and I &s;hall relate it to my <HI>Delia,</HI> my fair oracle, for interpretation. Methought I was on a &s;udden (the&s;e things are all done &s;uddenly) tran&s;ported from the city of <HI>London</HI> to the realms of <HI>Heaven,</HI> where a <HI>Se|raph,</HI> in the form of my departed &s;i&s;ter, (whom you and I u&s;ed &s;o much to admire) immediate|ly acknowledged me, and addre&s;&s;ed me thus: <Q>Upon what account is my dear <HI>Lucy</HI> come,
<PB N="107" REF="016020_0259_0F9B2875C6B37FF8">
uncalled, to <HI>Ely&s;ium?</HI> or How got &s;he hither without a guide!</Q> "I come," &s;aid I, <Q>in behalf of a dying friend, on the pre&s;ervation of who&s;e life depends the felicity of mine. Lead me, my &s;i&s;ter, to the Angel of <HI>Health,</HI> and I will kneel down and wor&s;hip him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If that is the purport of your errand to <HI>E|ly&s;ium,</HI> I fear you are come here in vain,</Q> &s;aid <HI>Clari&s;&s;a:</HI> <Q>there can be no partialities, and yon old, grey-headed, frowning per&s;onage, you &s;ee with a &s;cythe in his hand, would be very angry if he was but to imagine what you want. Death is above a bribe, &s;i&s;ter, you may depend on it.</Q></P>
<P>At this in&s;tant I beheld a mo&s;t beautiful cherub, with golden plumage expanded, flut|tering over my head, and alight by the &s;ight of me. I trembled and bowed. "Stranger," &s;aid the cele&s;tial figure, <Q>I know your bu&s;ine&s;s! put the name of your friend into that little lattice; it leads to the palace of the Angel of <HI>Pity;</HI> approach reverently.</Q></P>
<P>Soon after I had obeyed the&s;e commands, a door opened, out of which came the mo&s;t ele|gant appearance of the female &s;ex that can po&s;|&s;ibly be imagined, and with her a &s;econd form, who&s;e face was &s;haded by a &s;nowy veil.&mdash;
<PB N="108" REF="016020_0260_0F9B2875F0BCA770">
"Mortal," &s;aid the fir&s;t &s;plendid figure, <Q>the prayer of the affectionate &s;hall not be offered in vain; thy friend &s;hall live, and lo! here &s;he is in the bloom of beauty, and in the height of health.</Q> Saying this, the veil was thrown a&s;ide, and in the &s;econd form I imme|diately recognized the features of <HI>Fanny,</HI> more animated and animating than ever. I ran to embrace the &s;i&s;ter of my friend; but the An|gel of <HI>Pity</HI> interpo&s;ed, and after bidding me depart in peace, &s;he waved a golden wand, and then the different emotions occa&s;ioned by the vi&s;ion awaked me.</P>
<P>And yet, <HI>Delia,</HI> I am per&s;uaded this dream will be propitious. How truly happy &s;hall I be, if you &s;end me word that I have made a trip to <HI>Ely&s;ium</HI> to &s;ome purpo&s;e. Nor will I, at any rate, &s;uffer you to call me &s;uper&s;titious; for the thing is very probable: &s;urely, in reco|vering &s;uch a woman, where &s;uch a family and &s;uch a hu&s;band are concerned, the Angels of <HI>Pity</HI> and <HI>Health</HI> may very probably be intere&s;t|ed. I will not excu&s;e you, if you do not ac|quaint me with the &s;ucce&s;s of my dream im|mediately.</P>
<P>As to the conduct and conver&s;ation of Mr. <HI>Sedley</HI> in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, I cannot but ad|mire

his addre&s;s and ingenuity. His making a confidante of your brother was &s;uch a &s;troke of policy as &s;hews him to be no ordinary lover; and I can &s;ee, from the delicate turn of his compliments, and his management of tho&s;e namele&s;s delicacies, (which though called mi|nute, are among&s;t the points of importance) that he is no novice in tho&s;e matters. You a&s;k for my &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject: What can I &s;ay? Have you not &s;ent me the mo&s;t a|miable &s;pecimen of his attachment?

Has he not, by your own confe&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t decorated addre&s;s, the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;entiments, the mo&s;t elevated air? and, Is it not the opinion of your brother, that he never met with any gentleman <Q>&s;o ea&s;y, or &s;o engaging, in that &s;ort of behaviour which is the re&s;ult of a brilliant capacity, ornamented breeding, and unaffected complai&s;ance?</Q></P>
<P>Thus recommended, then, my dear, on all &s;ides, how is it po&s;&s;ible that my &s;entiments &s;hould not be greatly in his favour? How is it po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould not wi&s;h to alter the &s;u|per&s;cription

Motte,</HI> what a mechanical creature is man! People who are hired for their attendance at a funeral are &s;o familiarized to the la&s;t ceremo|nies, that they &s;mile in their &s;ables; and, while they are conveying youth and beauty to the tomb, can enjoy the ordinary, every-day e|vents of life with as much glee and incon&s;ider|ation as if they were carrying the gaye&s;t bride and bridegroom to the altar. The mourners who came with me, are at this in&s;tant carou&s;|ing in the next room, while &s;he who u&s;ed heretofore to be the companion of my jour|neys, and made every place a <HI>home</HI> to me by the enchantments of her pre&s;ence and &s;ociety, is waiting their lei&s;ure, and lying in a gloomy vehicle, without any refre&s;hment whatever.</P>
<P>Without refre&s;hment!

<P>But, to drop this ineffectual part of my &s;ub|ject, and proceed to another, more likely to excite your curio&s;ity, Do you know, mo&s;t a&s;&s;i|duous and yet mo&s;t <HI>negligent</HI> Sir, that a part of your trea&s;ures are now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?

<P>Now, it plainly appears, Sir, from the &s;everal parts referred to, that you purpo&s;ely pillaged the volume for the <HI>pernicious,</HI> and rejected the <HI>in&s;tructive.</HI> This would have been very pro|per, had you contented your&s;elf, like other commentators, with reprobating what is <HI>wrong,</HI> in order to &s;et it apart from what is <HI>right:</HI> but how could &s;uch ordinary methods be expected

<HEAD>LETTER CV. Thomas at the Bath, to Timothy in Town.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Timothy,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<L>"How like a dog look'd Hercules,</L>
<L>"Thus to a di&s;taff chain'd!"</L>
<P>'SDEATH, <HI>Timothy,</HI> "I'm &s;ped, I'm mar|ried." In the very flower of my youth, in the bud of my adventures, I'm cut off from all the joys of rambling, by matrimony. In a word, <HI>Timothy,</HI> the fir&s;t fair &s;he that I was <HI>well with,</HI> as the great Lord <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> calls it, complained in form to my ma&s;ter, who, in the moment of his rage, drew his &s;word, cocked his pi&s;tol, and giving me the choice of two cur&s;ed things, namely, death or a wife, would certainly have &s;ent me to my account, "with all my imperfections on my head," even now broad blown in the middle of May, if I had not fixed upon &s;omething: and, although in the confu&s;ion of my fears I have cho&s;en the wor&s;t of the two de&s;tinies, by taking to my bed the low-born wench I have <HI>&s;imulated,</HI> yet, "no man knows the fate he's born to," and I have been to the church with a water-dipper, yea, <HI>Timo|thy,</HI> with a creature, who for &s;ome years, hath got her bread by &s;tanding at the &s;ide of the
<PB N="133" REF="016020_0285_0F9B288BDA21C220">
bath, and pre&s;enting a brimmer of the water to the pa&s;&s;enger. Then &s;he is as in&s;ipid as the water it&s;elf, and ten times more illiterate than the tumbler that contains it. I marked her out only as a petty experiment, ju&s;t to bring my hand into play, as it were, before I ventured to <HI>Che&s;terfieldi&s;e;</HI> a word, <HI>Timothy,</HI> I collected from <HI>Thornton's</HI> letters, which thou knowe&s;t I have an occa&s;ional acce&s;s to, with others.

<P>I Have received &s;afe all the letters you directed to me, and I &s;hould have honoured them much &s;ooner, had it been in my power; but the truth is, I have too much bu&s;ine&s;s to allow much time for plea&s;ure; or, rather, I endeavour to make my plea&s;ure and my bu&s;ine&s;s go fair and &s;oftly, like worthy fellow-&s;ervants in the &s;ame family.

<P>With re&s;pect to the books you figure &s;o much upon, I know nothing about them; and if they relate only to picking of teeth, and turning out of toes, paring of nails, blowing no&s;es, and taking off hats, I mu&s;t beg to be ex|cu&s;ed having any thing to do with it; in the fir&s;t place becau&s;e I think I know all the&s;e things partly as well as his Lord&s;hip, and, per|haps, &s;ome of them better.

<HEAD>MAXIMS.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. Have a &s;erious <HI>exterior.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Study command of temper and countenance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Di&s;&s;emble re&s;entment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Judge of <HI>other</HI> men by your <HI>own</HI> feelings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Be upon your <HI>own</HI> guard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Throw others off <HI>theirs.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Study the pa&s;&s;ions and foibles of both &s;exes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Flatter the vanity of all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. A flexibility of manners commendable.</ITEM>

<P>The&s;e are, I perceive, &s;elected from the per|nicious volumes of the late Lord <HI>Che&s;terfield,</HI> who&s;e letters falling into the hand of any vo|luptuous character, might very naturally pro|duce effects the mo&s;t dreadful. It is very un|happy that me and mine &s;hould have been marked out as the fir&s;t victims. But that misfortune, like every other, mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained to the be&s;t of my ability. My poor daughter is

not dead: her &s;en&s;es are in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|&s;tored to her; and perhaps the life of her mo|ther, hu&s;band, and father, may be made &s;up|portable by her pre&s;ervation. In the mid&s;t of my own mi&s;ery, Sir, I have a wi&s;h for the nuptial joy of you, and the amiable young lady to whom you are now &s;o tenderly united. I formerly knew the brave Lieutenant <HI>Vernon,</HI> and I beg the compliments of a forlorn parent may be made welcome to him: recollect me, al&s;o, kindly to Mrs. <HI>Thornton,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Ver|non.</HI> The corp&s;e of Mr. <HI>Sedley</HI> &s;hall be &s;ent to your addre&s;s, as &s;oon as the hear&s;e can be pro|vided. He purpo&s;ely concealed him&s;elf from all his worthy connexions here: nor did I know, till the receipt of yours, the illu&s;trious ance&s;tors and family of the man to whom I am indebted for this accumulated agony. Not|with&s;tanding this, my re&s;entment &s;urvives not the life of the aggre&s;&s;or, whom I will &s;ee ju&s;tice and decency done to, with a &s;crupulous exact|ne&s;s. <HI>His</HI> lo&s;s of honour would ill warrant <HI>my</HI> lo&s;s of humanity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXI. Mi&s;s Delia Delmore to Lady Lucy Saxby. (Dated &s;ix weeks after the preceding)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Lady <HI>Lucy,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PROVIDENCE and Felicity &s;eem again di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;mile upon us. The trial and honourable acquittal of Mr. <HI>Mortimer</HI> is over: and the thou&s;and tender a&s;&s;urances he has given his <HI>Fanny,</HI> (whom Heaven has &s;pared to us) that the violence &s;he &s;u&s;tained, is quite for|gotten, have contributed, with the care&s;&s;es of her affectionate parents, to reconcile her to that life, which GOD &s;eems intending to continue. Though extremely weak, &s;he is in perfect po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;en&s;es, and mends every day.&mdash;There is certainly &s;ome turn in her favour, and perhaps &s;he is pre&s;erved as an example of Almighty benignity, that will not de&s;ert per&s;e|vering goodne&s;s, and patient affliction. The truth of Mr. <HI>Sedley's</HI> death, I mean as to the preci&s;e occa&s;ion of it, is little known. The Judge was extremely delicate on the &s;ubject: &s;o was every body concerned. Mr. <HI>Sedley's</HI> rela|tions have not wept over the a&s;hes of their kin&s;man, nor does any body &s;eem to regret,&mdash;

though every body profe&s;&s;es to be a&s;toni&s;hed. For my own part, I heartily dete&s;t his memory. Mr. <HI>Mortimer</HI> is &s;o truly tender of <HI>Fanny,</HI> that her gratitude &s;eems ripening into love: none e|ver de&s;erved a fonder return than our <HI>Mortimer.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, I warmly hope happine&s;s will a|gain &s;ub&s;i&s;t among&s;t us. On Thur&s;day &s;e'n|night our whole family &s;ets out for Montpelier: the &s;outhern &s;oftne&s;s, and a &s;hort ab&s;ence from the &s;cenes of irk&s;ome reflection, with a change of air and company, may be of &s;ervice to us all. That, in the mean time, you may enjoy all the tranquillity of a worthy, and ingenuous &s;pirit, is the often-repeated prayer of,</P>
