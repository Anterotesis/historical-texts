<HEAD>A SICILIAN ROMANCE.</HEAD>
<P>ON the northern &s;hore of Sicily are &s;till to be &s;een the magnificent remains of a ca&s;tle, which formerly be|longed to the noble hou&s;e of Mazzini. It &s;tands in the centre of a &s;mall bay, and upon a gentle acclivity, which&punc; on one &s;ide, &s;lopes towards the &s;ea, and on the other ri&s;es into an eminence crowned by dark woods. The &s;ituation i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> admirably beautiful and pic|ture&s;que, and the ruins have an air of ancient grandeur&punc; which, contra&s;ted with the pre&s;ent &s;olitude of the &s;cene, impre&s;&s;es the traveller with awe and curio&s;ity. During my travels abroad I vi&s;ited this &s;pot. As I walked over the loo&s;e fragments of &s;tone, which lay &s;cattered through the immen&s;e area of the fabrick, and &s;urveyed the &s;ublimity and grandeur of the ruins, I recurred, by a natural a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, to the times when the&s;e walls &s;tood proudly in their original &s;plendour, when the halls were the &s;cenes of ho&s;pital|ity, and fe&s;tive magnificence, and when they re&s;ounded with the voices of tho&s;e whom death had long &s;ince &s;wept from the earth. "Thus, &s;aid I," &s;hall the pre&s;ent generation&mdash;he who now &s;inks in mi&s;ery&mdash;and he who now &s;wims in plea&s;ure, alike pa&s;s away and be forgotten." My heart &s;welled with the reflexion; and, as I returned from the &s;cene with a &s;igh, I fixed
<PB N="4" REF="029381_0003_0FE0D15318912388">
my eyes upon a friar, who&s;e venerable figure, gently bending towards the earth, formed no unintere&s;ting object in the picture. He ob&s;erved my emotion; and, as my eye met his, &s;hook his head and pointed to the ruin. "The&s;e walls," &s;aid he, "were once the &s;eat of luxury and vice. They exhibited a &s;ingular in|&s;tance of the retribution of Heaven, and were from that period for&s;aken, and abandoned to decay." His words excited my curio&s;ity, and I inquired further con|cerning their meaning.</P>
<P>"A &s;olemn hi&s;tory belongs to this ca&s;tle," &s;aid he, "which is too long and intricate for me to relate. It is, however, contained in a manu&s;cript in our library, of which, I could, perhaps, procure you a &s;ight. A brother of our order, a de&s;cendant of the noble hou&s;e of Mazzini, collected and recorded the mo&s;t &s;triking in|cidents relating to his family, and the hi&s;tory thus formed, he left as a legacy to our convent. If you plea&s;e, we will walk thither."</P>
<P>I accompanied him to the convent, and the friar in|troduced me to his &s;uperior, a man of an intelligent mind and benevolent heart, with whom I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in intere&s;ting conver&s;ation. I believe my &s;enti|ments plea&s;ed him; for by his indulgence, I was per|mitted to take ab&s;tracts of the hi&s;tory before me, which, with &s;ome further particulars obtained in conver&s;ation with the abate, I have arranged in the following pages.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of the &s;ixteenth century, this ca&s;tle was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ferdinand, fifth mar|quis of Mazzini, and was for &s;ome years the principal re&s;idence of his family. He was a man of a voluptuous and imperious character. To his fir&s;t wife, he marri|ed Loui&s;a Bernini, &s;econd daughter of the count della Salario, a lady yet more di&s;tingui&s;hed for the &s;weet|ne&s;s of her manners and the gentlene&s;s of her di&s;po&s;i|tion, than for her beauty. She brought the marquis one &s;on and two daughters, who lo&s;t their amiable mo|ther in early childhood. The arrogant and impetuous character of the marquis, operated powerfully upon the mild and &s;u&s;ceptible nature of his lady; and it was by many per&s;ons believed, that his unkindne&s;s and neglect put a period to her life However this might be, he &s;oon afterwards married Maria de Vellorno, a young lady eminently beautiful, but of a character very op|po&s;ite to that of her predece&s;&s;or. She was a woman of infinite art, devoted to plea&s;ure and of an unconquera|ble &s;pirit. The marquis, who&s;e heart was dead to pa|ternal tenderne&s;s, and who&s;e pre&s;ent lady was too vola|tile to attend to dome&s;tic concerns, committed the edu|cation of his daughters to the care of a lady, completely qualified for the undertaking, and who was di&s;tantly related to the late marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>He quitted Mazzini &s;oon after his &s;econd marriage, for the gaieties and &s;plendour of Naples, whither his &s;on accompanied him. Though naturally of a haugh|ty and overbearing di&s;po&s;ition, he was governed by his wife. His pa&s;&s;ions were vehement, and &s;he had the addre&s;s to bend them to her own purpo&s;e; and &s;o well
<PB N="6" REF="029381_0005_0FE0D15D60BDE5A0">
to conceal her influence, that he thought him&s;elf mo&s;t independent when he was mo&s;t en&s;laved. He paid an annual vi&s;it to the ca&s;tle of Mazzini; but the marchi|one&s;s &s;eldom attended him, and he &s;taid only to give &s;uch general directions concerning the education of his daughters, as his pride, rather than his affection, &s;eem|ed to dictate.</P>
<P>Emilia, the elder, inherited much of her mother's di&s;po&s;ition. She had a mild and &s;weet temper, united with a clear and comprehen&s;ive mind. Her younger &s;i&s;ter, Julia, was of a more lively ca&s;t. An extreme &s;en&s;ibility &s;ubjected her to frequent unea&s;ine&s;s; her temper was warm, but generous; &s;he was quickly ir|ritated and quickly appea&s;ed; and to a reproof, how|ever gentle, &s;he would often weep, but was never &s;ul|len. Her imagination was ardent, and her mind early exhibited &s;ymptoms of genius. It was the particular care of madame de Menoa to counteract tho&s;e traits in the di&s;po&s;ition of her young pupi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, which appeared inimical to their future happine&s;s; and for this ta&s;k &s;he had abilities which entitled her to hope for &s;ucce&s;s. A &s;eries of early misfortunes had entendered her heart, without weakening the powers of her under&s;tanding. In retirement &s;he had acquired tranquillity, and had al|mo&s;t lo&s;t the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e &s;orrows which yet threw a &s;oft and not unplea&s;ing &s;hade over her charac|ter. She loved her young charge with maternal fond|ne&s;s, and their gradual improvement and re&s;pectful tenderne&s;s repaid all her anxiety. Madame excelled in mu&s;ic and drawing. She had often forgot her &s;or|rows in the&s;e amu&s;ements, when her mind was too much occupied to derive con&s;olation from books, and &s;he was a&s;&s;iduou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to impart to Emilia and Julia a power &s;o valuable as that of beguiling the &s;en&s;e of affliction. Emilia's ta&s;te led her to drawing, and &s;he &s;oon made
<PB N="7" REF="029381_0006_0FE0D1641EDF32C0">
rapid advances in that art. Julia was uncommonly &s;u&s;|ceptible of the charms of harmony. She had feelings which trembled in uni&s;on to all its various and enchant|ing powers.</P>
<P>The in&s;tructions of madame &s;he caught with a&s;toni&s;h|ing quickne&s;s, and in a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt time attained to a degree of excellence in her favourite &s;tudy, which few per&s;ons have ever exceeded. Her manner was entirely her own. It was not in the rapid intricacies of execution, that &s;he excelled &s;o much, as in that delicacy of ta&s;te, and in tho&s;e enchanting powers of expre&s;&s;ion, which &s;eem to breathe a &s;oul through the &s;ound, and which make captive the heart of the hearer. The lute was her fa|vourite in&s;trument, and its tender notes accorded well with the &s;weet and melting tones of her voice.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Mazzini was a large irregular fabrick, and &s;eemed &s;uited to receive a numerous train of fol|lowers, &s;uch as, in tho&s;e day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;erved the nobility, either in the &s;plendour of peace, or the turbulence of war. Its pre&s;ent family inhabited only a &s;mall part of it; and even this part appeared forlorn and almo&s;t de&s;|olate from the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the apartments, and the length of the galleries which led to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m. A melan|choly &s;tillne&s;s reigned through the halls, and the &s;ilence of the courts, which were &s;haded by high turrets, was for many hours together undi&s;turbed by the &s;ound of any foot-&s;tep. Julia, who di&s;covered an early ta&s;te for books, loved to retire in an evening to a &s;mall clo&s;et in which &s;he had collected her favourite authors. This room formed the we&s;tern angle of the ca&s;tle: one of its windows looked upon the &s;ea, beyond which was faintly &s;een, &s;kirting the horizon, the dark rocky coa&s;t of Calabria; the other opened towards a part of the ca&s;tle, and afforded a pro&s;pect of the neighbouring woods. Her mu&s;ical in&s;truments were here depo&s;ited,
<PB N="8" REF="029381_0007_0FE0D168B5B490D0">
with whatever a&s;&s;i&s;ted her favourite amu&s;ements. This &s;pot, which was at once elegant, plea&s;ant, and retired, was embelli&s;hed with many little ornaments of her own invention, and with &s;ome drawings executed by her &s;i&s;ter. The clo&s;et was adjoining her chamber, and was &s;eparated from the apartment of madame, only by a &s;hort gallery. This gallery opened into another, long and winding, which led to the grand &s;tairca&s;e, termi|nating in the north hall, with which the chief apart|ments of the north &s;ide of the edifice communicated.</P>
<P>Madame de Menon's apartment opened into both galleries. It was in one of the&s;e rooms that &s;he u&s;ual|ly &s;pent the mornings, occupied in the improvement of her young charge. The windows looked towards the &s;ea, and the room was light and plea&s;ant. It was their cu&s;tom to dine in one of the lower apartments, and at table they were always joined by a dependant of the marquis's, who had re&s;ided many years in the ca&s;tle, and who in&s;tructed the young ladies in the Latin tongue, and in geography. During the fine evenings of &s;ummer, this little party frequently &s;upped in a pa|villion, which was built on an eminence in the woods belonging to the ca&s;tle. From this &s;pot the eye had an almo&s;t boundle&s;s range of &s;ea and land. It com|manded the &s;traits of Me&s;&s;ina, with the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of Calabria, and a great extent of the wild and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctur|e&s;que &s;cenery of Sicily. Mount Aetna, crowned with eternal &s;nows, and &s;hooting from among the clouds, formed a grand and &s;ublime picture in the back ground of the &s;cene. The city of Palermo was al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h|able; and Julia, as &s;he gazed on its glittering &s;pires, would endeavour in imagination to depicture its beau|ties while &s;he &s;ecretly &s;ighed for a view of that world, from which &s;he had hitherto been &s;ecluded by the mean jealou&s;y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the marchione&s;s, upon who&s;e mind the dread
<PB N="9" REF="029381_0008_0FE0D16F631EEBC8">
of rival beauty operated &s;trongly to the prejudice of Emilia and Julia. She employed all her influence over the marquis to detain them in retirement; and, though Emilia was now twenty, and her &s;i&s;ter eigh|teen, they had never pa&s;&s;ed the boundaries of their fa|ther's domains.</P>
<P>Vanity often produces unrea&s;onable alarm; but the marchione&s;s had in this in&s;tance ju&s;t grounds for appre|hen&s;ion; the beauty of her lord's daughters has &s;eldom been exceeded. The per&s;on of Emilia was finely pro|portioned. Her complexion was fair, her hair flaxen, and her dark blue eyes were full of &s;weet expre&s;&s;ion. Her manners were dignified and elegant, and in her air was a feminine &s;oftne&s;s, a tender timidity, which ir|re&s;i&s;tibly attracted the heart of the beholder. The figure of Julia was light and graceful&mdash;her &s;tep was airy&mdash;her mien animated, and her &s;mile enchanting. Her eyes were dark, and full of fire, but tempered with mode&s;t &s;weetne&s;s. Her features were finely turned&mdash; every laughing grace played round her mouth, and her countenance quickly di&s;covered all the various emotions of her &s;oul. The dark auburn hair which curled in beautiful profu&s;ion in her neck, gave a fini&s;hing charm to her appearance.</P>
<P>Thus lovely, and thus veiled in ob&s;curity, were the daughters of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble Mazzini. But they were hap|py, for they knew not enough of the world &s;eriou&s;ly to regret the want of its enjoyments, though Julia would &s;ometimes &s;igh for the airy image which her fancies painted, and a painful curio&s;ity would ari&s;e concerning the bu&s;y &s;cenes from which &s;he was excluded. A re|turn to her cu&s;tomary amu&s;ements, however, would cha&s;e the ideal image from her mind and re&s;tore her u&s;ual happy complacency. Books, mu&s;ic, and paint|ing divided the hours of her lei&s;ure, and many beauti|ful
<PB N="10" REF="029381_0009_0FE0D174D5206AB0">
&s;ummer evenings were &s;pent in the pavillion, where the refined conver&s;ation of madame, the poetry of Ta&s;&s;o, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ute of Julia, and the friend&s;hip of Emi|lia, combined to form a &s;pecies of happine&s;s, &s;uch as elevated and highly &s;u&s;ceptible minds are alone capa|ble of receiving or communicating. Madame under|&s;tood and practi&s;ed all the graces of conver&s;ation, and her young pupils perceived its value, and caught the &s;pirit of its character.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ation may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es&mdash;the familiar and the &s;entimental. It is the province of the familiar, to di&s;&s;u&s;e cheerfulne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e&mdash;to open the heart of man to man, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eam a temperate &s;un|&s;hine upon the mind.&mdash;Nature and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t mu&s;t con&s;pire to render us &s;u&s;ceptible of the charms, and to qualify us for the practice of the &s;econd cla&s;s of conver&s;ation, here termed &s;entimental, and in which madame de Menon particularly excelled. To good &s;en&s;e, lively feeling, and natural delicacy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;te, mu&s;t be united an ex|pan&s;ion of mind, and a refinement of thought, which is the re&s;ult of high cultivation. To render this &s;ort of conver&s;ation irre&s;i&s;tibly attractive, a knowledge of the world is requi&s;ite, and that enchanting ea&s;e, that ele|gance of manne, which is to be acquired only by fre|quenting the higher circles of poli&s;hed life. In &s;en|timental conver&s;ation, &s;ubjects intere&s;ting to the heart and to the imagination, are brought forward; they are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a kind of &s;portive way, with animation and refinement, and are never continued longer than politene&s;s allows. Here fancy flouri&s;hes,&mdash;the &s;en&s;i|bilities expand&mdash;and wit, guided by delicacy, and em|belli&s;hed by ta&s;te&mdash;points to the heart.</P>
<P>Such was the conver&s;ation of madame de Menon; and the plea&s;ant gaiety of the pavillion &s;eemed pecu|liarly to ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt it for the &s;cene of &s;ocial delights. On
<PB N="11" REF="029381_0010_0FE0D17C51C13250">
the evening of a very &s;ultry day, having &s;upped in their favourite &s;pot, the coolne&s;s of the hour, and the beauty of the night, tempted this happy party to re|main there later than u&s;ual. Returning home, they were &s;urpri&s;ed by the appearance of a light through the broken window-&s;hutters of an apartment, belong|ing to a divi&s;ion of the ca&s;tle which had for many years been &s;hut up. They &s;topped to ob&s;erve it, when it &s;uddenly di&s;appeared and was &s;een no more. Ma|dame de Menon, di&s;turbed at this phenomenon, ha&s;|tened into the ca&s;tle, with a view of inquiring into the cau&s;e of it, when &s;he was met in the north hall by Vincent. She related to him what &s;he had &s;een, and ordered an immediate &s;earch to be made for the keys of tho&s;e apartments. She apprehended that &s;ome per|&s;on had penetrated that part of the edifice with an in|tention of plunder; and, di&s;daining a paltry fear where her duty was concerned, &s;he &s;ummoned the &s;er|vants of the ca&s;tle, with an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ention of accompany|ing them thither. Vincent &s;miled at her apprehen&s;ions, and imputed what &s;he had &s;een to an illu&s;ion, which the &s;olemnity of the hour had impre&s;&s;ed upon her fan|cy. Madame, however, per&s;evered in her purpo&s;e; and, after a long and repeated &s;earch, a ma&s;&s;ey key covered with ru&s;t was produced. She then proceeded to the &s;outhern &s;ide of the edifice, accompanied by Vincent, and followed by the &s;ervants, who were agi|tated with impatient wonder. The key was applied to an iron gate, which opened into a court that &s;eparated this divi&s;ion from the other parts of the ca&s;tle. They entered this court, which was overgrown with gra&s;s and weeds, and a&s;cended &s;ome &s;teps that led to a large door, which they vainly endeavoured to open. All the different keys of the ca&s;tle were app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied to the lock, without effect, and they were at length compel|ed
<PB N="12" REF="029381_0011_0FE0D180E97A7C08">
to quit the place, without having either &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity, or quieted their fears. Every thing, however, was &s;till, and the light did not re-appear. Madame concealed her apprehen&s;ions, and the family retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance dwelt on the mind of madame de Menon, and it was &s;ome time before &s;he ventured again to &s;pend an evening in the pavillion. After &s;everal months pa&s;&s;ed, without further di&s;turbance or di&s;cove|ry, another occurrence renewed the alarm. Julia had one night remained in her clo&s;et later than u&s;ual. A favourite book had engaged her attention beyond the hour of cu&s;tomary repo&s;e, and every inhabitant of the ca&s;tle, except her&s;elf, had long been lo&s;t in &s;leep. She was rou&s;ed from her forgetfulne&s;s, by the &s;ound of the ca&s;tle clock, which &s;truck one. Surpri&s;ed at the late|ne&s;s of the hour, &s;he ro&s;e in ha&s;te, and was moving to her chamber, when the beauty of the night attracted her to the window. She opened it; and ob&s;erving a fine effect of moon-light upon the dark woods, leaned forwards. In that &s;ituation &s;he had not long remained, when &s;he perceived a light faintly fla&s;h through a ca&s;e|ment in the uninhabited part of the ca&s;tle. A &s;udden tremor &s;eized her, and &s;he with difficulty &s;upported her&s;elf. In a few moments it di&s;appeared, and &s;oon after a figure, bearing a lamp, proceeded from an ob|&s;cure door belonging to the &s;outh tower; and &s;tealing along the out&s;ide of the ca&s;tle walls, turned round the &s;outhern angle, by which it was afterwards hid from the view. A&s;toni&s;hed and terrified at what &s;he had &s;een, &s;he hurried to the apartment of madame de Me|non, and related the circum&s;tance. The &s;ervants were immediately rou&s;ed, and the alarm became gene|ral. Madame aro&s;e and de&s;cended into the north hall, where the dome&s;tics were already a&s;&s;embled. No one
<PB N="13" REF="029381_0012_0FE0D18830798BC0">
could be found of courage &s;ufficient to enter into the courts; and the orders of Madame were di&s;regarded, when oppo&s;ed to the effects of &s;uper&s;titious terror. She perceived that Vincent was ab&s;ent, but as &s;he was ordering him to be called, he entered the hall. Sur|pri&s;ed to find the family thus a&s;&s;embled, he was told the occa&s;ion. He immediately ordered a party of the &s;ervants to attend him round the ca&s;tle walls; and with &s;ome reluctance, and more fear, they obeyed him. They all returned to the hall, without having witne&s;&s;|ed any extraordinary appearance; but though their fears were not confirmed, they were by no means di&s;|&s;ipated. The appearance of a light in a part of the ca&s;tle which had for &s;everal years been &s;hut up, and to which time and circum&s;tance had given an air of &s;ingu|lar de&s;olation, might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to excite a &s;trong degree of &s;urpri&s;e and terror. In the minds of the vulgar, any &s;pecies of the wonderful is received with avidity; and the &s;ervants did not he&s;itate in be|lieving the &s;outhern divi&s;ion of the ca&s;tle to be inha|bited by a &s;upernatural power. Too much agitated to &s;leep, they agreed to watch for the remainder of the night. For this purpo&s;e they arranged them&s;elves in the ea&s;t gallery, where they had a view of the &s;outh tower from which the light had i&s;&s;ued. The night, however, pa&s;&s;ed without any further di&s;turbance; and the morning dawn, which they beheld with inexpre&s;&s;i|ble plea&s;ure, di&s;&s;ipated for a while the glooms of ap|prehen&s;ion. But the return of evening renewed the general fear, and for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights the do|me&s;tics watched the &s;outhern tower. Although no|thing remarkable was &s;een, a report was &s;oon rai&s;ed, and believed, that the &s;outhern &s;ide of the ca&s;tle was haunted. Madame de Menon, who&s;e mind was &s;upe|rior to the effects of &s;uper&s;tition, was yet di&s;turbed
<PB N="14" REF="029381_0013_0FE0D18CD3F490F8">
and perplexed, and &s;he determined, if the light re|appeared, to inform the marquis of the circum&s;tance, and reque&s;t the keys of tho&s;e apartments.</P>
<P>The marquis, immer&s;ed in the di&s;&s;ipations of Na|ples, &s;eldom remembered the ca&s;tle, or its inhabitants. His &s;on, who had been educated under his immediate care, was the &s;ole object of his pride, as the marchio|ne&s;s was that of his affection. He loved her with ro|mantic fondne&s;s, which &s;he repaid with &s;eeming ten|derne&s;s, and &s;ecret perfidy. She allowed her&s;elf a free indulgence in the mo&s;t licentious plea&s;ures, yet conducted her&s;elf with an art &s;o exqui&s;ite as to elude di&s;covery, and even &s;u&s;picion. In her amours &s;he was equally incon&s;tant as ardent, till the young count Hippolitus de Vereza attracted her attention. The natural ficklene&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition &s;eemed then to cea&s;e, and upon him &s;he centered all her de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The count Vereza lo&s;t his father in early childhood. He was now of age, and had ju&s;t entered upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tates. His per&s;on was graceful, yet manly; his mind accompli&s;hed, and his manners elegant; his countenance expre&s;&s;ed a happy union of &s;pirit, dignity, and benevolence, which formed the principal traits of his character. He had a &s;ublimity of thought, which taught him to de&s;pi&s;e the voluptu|ous vices of the Neapolitans, and led him to higher pur&s;uits. He was the cho&s;en and early friend of young Ferdinand, the &s;on of the marquis, and was a frequent vi&s;itor in the family. When the marchione&s;s fir&s;t &s;aw him, &s;he treated him with great di&s;tinction, and at length made &s;uch advances, as neither the ho|nour nor the inclinations of the count permitted him to notice. He conducted him&s;elf towards her with frigid indifference, which &s;erved only to inflame the pa&s;&s;ion it was meant to chill. The favours of the
<PB N="15" REF="029381_0014_0FE0D19327F81610">
marchione&s;s had hitherto been &s;ought with avidity, and accepted with rapture; and the repul&s;ive in&s;en&s;ibili|ty which &s;he now experienced, rou&s;ed all her pride, and called into action every refinement of coquetry.</P>
<P>It was about this period that Vincent was &s;eized with a di&s;order which increa&s;ed &s;o rapidly, as in a &s;hort time to a&s;&s;ume the mo&s;t alarming appearance. De&s;pairing of life, he de&s;ired that a me&s;&s;enger might be di&s;patched to inform the marqui&s;s of his &s;ituation, and to &s;ignify his earne&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ee him before he died. The progre&s;s of his di&s;order defied every art of medicine, and his vi&s;ible di&s;tre&s;s of mind &s;eemed to accelerate his &s;ate. Perceiving his la&s;t hour approach|ing, he reque&s;ted to have a confe&s;&s;or. The confe&s;&s;or was &s;hut up with him a con&s;iderable time, and he had already received extreme unction, when Madame de Menon was &s;ummoned to his bed &s;ide. The hand of death was now upon him, cold damps hung upon his brows, and he, with difficulty, rai&s;ed his heavy eyes to Madame as &s;he entered the apartment. He beckon|ed her towards him, and de&s;iring that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o per&s;on might be permitted to enter the room, was for a few mo|ments &s;ilent. His mind appeared to labour under op|pre&s;&s;ive remembrances: he made &s;everal attempts to &s;peak, but either re&s;olution or &s;trength failed him. At length, giving Madame a look of unutterable angui&s;h, "Alas madam," &s;aid he, "Heaven grants not the prayer of &s;uch a wretch as I am. I mu&s;t expire long before the marquis can arrive. Since I &s;hall &s;ee him no more, I would impart to you a &s;ecret which lies heavy at my heart, and which makes my la&s;t moments dreadful, as they are without hope." Be comforted," &s;aid Madame, who was affected by the energy of his manner, "we are taught to believe that forgivene&s;s is never denied to &s;incere repentance." "You, ma|dam,
<PB N="16" REF="029381_0015_0FE0D197CCF77928">
are ignorant of the enormity of my crime, and of the &s;ecret&mdash;the horrid &s;ecret which labours at my brea&s;t. My guilt is beyond remedy in this world, and I fear will be without pardon in the next; I therefore hope little from confe&s;&s;ion even to a prie&s;t. Yet &s;ome good it is &s;till in my power to do; let me di&s;clo&s;e to you that &s;ecret which is &s;o my&s;teriou&s;ly connected with the &s;outhern apartments of this ca&s;tle". "What of them!" exclaimed Madame, with impati|ence. Vincent returned no an&s;wer; exhau&s;ted by the effort of &s;peaking, he had fainted. Madame rung for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by proper applications, his &s;en&s;es were recalled. He was however, entirely &s;peechle&s;s, and in this &s;tate he remained till he expired, which was about an hour after he had conver&s;ed with Madame.</P>
<P>The perplexity and a&s;toni&s;hment of Madame, were by the late &s;eene heightened to a very painful degree. She recollected the various particulars relative to the &s;outhern divi&s;ion of the ca&s;tle, the many years it had &s;tood uninhabited&mdash;the &s;ilence which had been ob&s;erv|ed concerning it&mdash;the appearance of the light and the figure&mdash;the fruitle&s;s &s;earch for the keys, and the re|ports &s;o generally believed; and thus remembrance pre&s;ented her with a combination of circum&s;tances, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich &s;erved only to increa&s;e her wonder, and height|en her curio&s;ity. A ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of my&s;tery enveloped that part of the ca&s;tle, which it now &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible &s;hould ever be penetrated, &s;ince the only per&s;on who could have removed it, was no more.</P>
<P>The marquis arrived on the day after that on which Vincent had expired. He came attended by &s;ervants only, and alighted at the gates of the ca&s;tle with an air of impatience, and a countenance expre&s;&s;ive of &s;trong emotion. Madame, with the young ladies, re|ceived him in the hall. He ha&s;tily &s;aluted his daugh|ters,
<PB N="17" REF="029381_0016_0FE0D19C8BA51828">
and pa&s;&s;ed on to the oak parlour, de&s;iring Ma|dame to follow him. She obeyed, and the marquis inquired with great agitation after Vincent. When told of his death, he paced the room with hurried &s;teps, and was for &s;ome time &s;ilent, at length &s;eating him&s;elf, and &s;urveying Madame with a &s;crutinizing eye, he a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions concerning the particu|lars of Vincent's death. She mentioned his earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee the marquis, and repeated his la&s;t words. The marquis remained &s;ilent, and Madame proceeded to mention tho&s;e circum&s;tances relative to the &s;outhern divi&s;ion of the ca&s;tle, which &s;he thought it of &s;o much importance to di&s;cover. He treated the affair very lightly, laughed at her conjectures, repre&s;ented the appearances &s;he de&s;cribed as the illu&s;ions of a weak and timid mind, and broke up the conver&s;ation, by going to vi&s;it the chamber of Vincent, in which he re|mained a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>On the following day Emilia and Julia dined with the marquis. He was gloomy and &s;ilent; their efforts to amu&s;e him &s;eemed to excite di&s;plea&s;ure rather than kindne&s;s: and when the repa&s;t was concluded, he withdrew to his own apartment, leaving his daughters in a &s;tate of &s;orrow and &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Vincent was to be interred, according to his own de&s;ire, in the church belonging to the convent of St. Nicholas. One of the &s;ervants, after receiving &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary orders concerning the funeral, ventured to inform the marquis of the appearance of the lights in the &s;outh tower. He mentioned the &s;uper&s;titious re|ports that prevailed among&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;hold, and com|plained that the &s;ervants would not cro&s;s the courts af|ter it was dark. "And who is he that has commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|oned you with this &s;tory?" &s;aid the marquis, in a tone
<PB N="18" REF="029381_0017_0FE0D1A1EE786490">
of di&s;plea&s;ure; are the weak and ridiculous fancies of women and &s;ervants to be obtruded upon my notice? Away&mdash;appear no more before me, till you have learned to &s;peak what it is proper for me to hear." Robert withdrew aba&s;hed, and it was &s;ome time be|fore any per&s;on ventured to renew the &s;ubject with the marquis.</P>
<P>The majority of young Ferdinand now drew near, and the marquis determined to celebrate the occa&s;ion with fe&s;tive magnificence at the ca&s;tle of Mazzini. He therefore &s;ummoned the marchione&s;s, and his &s;on, from Naples, and very &s;plendid preparations were or|dered to be made. Emilia and Julia dreaded the arri|val of the marchione&s;s, who&s;e influence they had long been &s;en&s;ible of, and from who&s;e pre&s;ence they antici|pated a painful re&s;traint. Beneath the gentle gui|dance of Madame de Menon, their hours had pa&s;&s;ed in happy tranquillity, for they were ignorant alike of the &s;orrows and the plea&s;ures of the world. Tho&s;e did not oppre&s;s, and the&s;e did not inflame them. En|gaged in the pur&s;uits of knowledge, and in the at|tainment of elegant accompli&s;hments, their moments, flew lightly away, and the flight of time was marked only by improvement. In Madame was united the tenderne&s;s of the mother, with the &s;ympathy of a friend; and they loved her with a warm and inviola|ble affection.</P>
<P>The purpo&s;ed vi&s;it of their brother, whom they had not &s;een for &s;everal years, gave them great plea&s;ure. Although their minds retained no very di&s;tinct remem|brance of him, they looked forward with eager <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd delightful expectation to his virtues and his talents; and hoped to find in his company, a con&s;olation for the unea&s;ine&s;s which the pre&s;ence of the marchione&s;s would excite. Neither did Julia contemplate with indiffe|rence
<PB N="19" REF="029381_0018_0FE0D1A8C839AEB0">
the approaching fe&s;tival. A new &s;cene was now opening to her, which her young imagination paint|ed in the warm and glowing colours of delight. The near approach of plea&s;ure frequently awakens the heart to emotions, which would fail to be excited by a more remote and ab&s;tracted ob&s;ervance. Julia, who in the di&s;tance, had con&s;idered the &s;plendid gaieties of life with tranquillity, now lingered with impatient hope through the moments which withheld her from their enjoyments. Emilia, who&s;e feelings were le&s;s lively, and who&s;e imagination was le&s;s powerful, be|held the approaching fe&s;tival with calm con&s;ideration, and almo&s;t regretted the interruption of tho&s;e tranquil plea&s;ures, which &s;he knew to be more congenial with her powers and di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>In a few days the marchione&s;s arrived at the ca&s;tle. She was followed by a numerous retinue, and accom|panied by Ferdinand, and &s;everal of the Italian nob|le&s;&s;e, whom plea&s;ure attracted to her train. Her en|trance was proclaimed by the &s;ound of mu&s;ic, and tho&s;e gates, which had long ru&s;ted on their hinges, were thrown open to receive her. The courts and halls, who&s;e a&s;pect &s;o lately expre&s;&s;ed only gloom and de&s;olation, now &s;hone with &s;udden &s;plendor, and echo|ed the &s;ounds of gaiety and gladne&s;s. Julia &s;urveyed the &s;cene from an ob&s;cure window; and as the trium|phal &s;trains filled the air, her brea&s;t throbbed, her heart beat quick with joy, and &s;he lo&s;t her apprehen&s;i|ons from the marchione&s;s in a &s;ort of wild delight hi|therto unknown to her. The arrival of the marchio|ne&s;s &s;eemed indeed the &s;ignal of univer&s;al and unlimit|ed plea&s;ure. When the marquis came out to receive her, the gloom that lately clouded his countenance, broke away in &s;miles of welcome, which the whole company appeared to con&s;ider as invitations to joy.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="029381_0019_0FE0D1AE2D8EA4B8">The tranquil heart of Emilia was not proof again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;cene &s;o alluring, and &s;he &s;ighed at the pro&s;pect, yet &s;carcely knew why. Julia pointed out to her &s;i&s;|ter, the graceful figure of a young man who followed the marchione&s;s, and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her wi&s;hes that he might be her brother. From the contemplation of the &s;cene before them, they were &s;ummoned to meet the marchione&s;s. Julia trembled with apprehen&s;ion, and for a few moments wi&s;hed the ca&s;tle was in its former &s;tate. As they advanced through the &s;aloon, in which they were pre&s;ented, Julia was covered with blu&s;hes, but Emilia, tho' equally timid, pre&s;erved her graceful dignity. The marchione&s;s received them with a min|gled &s;mile of conde&s;cen&s;ion and politene&s;s, and imme|diately the whole attention of the company was at|tracted by their elegance and beauty. The eager eyes of Julia &s;ought in vain to di&s;cover her brother, of who&s;e features &s;he had no recollection in tho&s;e of any of the per&s;ons then pre&s;ent. At length her father pre|&s;ented him, and &s;he perceived with a &s;igh of regret, that he was not the youth &s;he had ob&s;erved from the window. He advanced with a very engaging air, and &s;he met him with an unfeigned welcome. His figure was tall and maje&s;tic; he had a very noble and &s;pirited carriage; and his countenance expre&s;&s;ed at once &s;weet|ne&s;s and dignity. Supper was &s;erved in the ea&s;t hall, and the tables were &s;pread with a profu&s;ion of delica|cies. A band of mu&s;ick played during the repa&s;t, and the evening concluded with a concert in the &s;a|loon.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE day of the fe&s;tival, &s;o long and &s;o impatient|ly looked for by Julia, was now arrived. All the neighbouring nobility were invited, and the gates of the ca&s;tle were thrown open for a general rejoicing. A magnificent entertainment, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t luxu|rious and expen&s;ive di&s;hes, was &s;erved in the balls. Soft mu&s;ic floated along the vaulted roofs, the walls were hung with decorations, and it &s;eemed as if the hand of a magician had &s;uddenly metamorpho&s;ed this once gloomy fabric into the palace of a fairy. The mar|quis, notwith&s;tanding the gaiety of the &s;cene&punc; frequent|ly appeared ab&s;tracted from its enjoyments, and in &s;pite of all his efforts at cheerfulne&s;s, the melancholy of his heart was vi&s;ible in his countenance.</P>
<P>In the evening there was a grand ball: the marchi|one&s;s, who was &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed for her beauty, and for the winning elegance of her manners, appeared in the mo&s;t &s;plendid attire. Her hair was ornamented with a profu&s;ion of jewels, but was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to give an air rather of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, than of grace, to her figure. Although con&s;cious of her charms, &s;he beheld the beauty of Emilia and Julia with a jealous eye, and was compelled &s;ecretly to acknowledge, that the &s;imple elegance with which they were adorned, was more enchanting than all the &s;tudied artifice of &s;plendid decoration. They were dre&s;&s;ed alike in light Sicilian habits, and the beautiful luxuriance of their flowing hair, was re&s;trained only by bandellets of pearl. The ball was opened by Ferdinand, and the lady Ma|tilda Con&s;tanza. Emilia danced with the young mar|quis della Fazelli, and acquitted her&s;elf with the ea&s;e and dignity &s;o natural to her. Julia experienced a
<PB N="22" REF="029381_0021_0FE0D1B84BC59490">
various emotion of plea&s;ure and fear when the count de Vereza, in whom &s;he recollected the cavalier &s;he had ob&s;erved from the window, led her forth. The grace of her &s;tep, and the elegant &s;ymmetry of her figure, rai&s;ed in the a&s;&s;embly a gentle murmur of ap|applau&s;e, and the &s;oft blu&s;h which now &s;tole over her cheek, gave an additional charm to her appearance. But when the mu&s;ic changed, and &s;he danced to the &s;oft Sicilian mea&s;ure, the airy grace of her movement, and the unaffected tenderne&s;s of her air, &s;unk attention into &s;ilence, which continued for &s;ome time after the dance had cea&s;ed. The marchione&s;s ob&s;erved the gen|eral admiration with &s;eeming plea&s;ure, and &s;ecret un|ea&s;ine&s;s. She had &s;uffered a very painful &s;olicitude, when the count de Vereza &s;elected her for his partner in the dance, and &s;he pur&s;ued him through the evening, with an eye of jealous &s;crutiny. Her bo&s;om, which before glowed only with love, was now torn by the agitation of other pa&s;&s;ions more violent and de&s;tructive. Her thoughts were re&s;tle&s;s, her mind wandered from the &s;cene before her, and it required all her addre&s;s to pre&s;erve an apparent ea&s;e. She &s;aw, or fancied &s;he &s;aw, an impa&s;&s;ioned air in the count, when he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Julia, that corroded her heart with jealous fury.</P>
<P>At twelve the gates of the ca&s;tle were thrown open, and the company quitted it for the woods, which were &s;plendidly illuminated. Arcades of light lined the long vi&s;tas, which were terminated by pyramids of lamps that pre&s;ented to the eye one bright column of flame. At irregular di&s;tances buildings were erected, hung with variagated lamps di&s;po&s;ed in the gaye&s;t and mo&s;t fanta&s;tic forms. Collations were &s;pread under the trees; and mu&s;ic, touched by un&s;een hands, breathed around. The mu&s;icians were placed in the
<PB N="23" REF="029381_0022_0FE0D1BF428FF1E0">
mo&s;t ob&s;cure and embowered &s;pots, &s;o as to elude the eye and &s;trike the imagination. The &s;cene appeared enchanted. Nothing met the eye but beauty, and romantic &s;plendor; the ear received no &s;ounds but tho&s;e of mirth and melody. The younger part of the company formed them&s;elves into groups which at in|tervals glanced through the woods, and were again un&s;een. Julia &s;eemed the magic queen of the place. Her heart dilated with plea&s;ure, and diffu&s;ed over her features an expre&s;&s;ion of pure and complacent delight. A generous, frank, and exalted &s;entiment &s;parkled in her eyes, and animated her manner. Her bo&s;om glowed with benevolent affections; and &s;he &s;eem|ed anxious to impart to all around her, a happi|ne&s;s as unmixed as that &s;he experienced. Wherever &s;he moved, admiration followed her &s;teps. Ferdinand was as gay as the &s;cene around him. Emilia was plea&s;ed; and the marquis &s;eemed to have left his me|lancholy in the ca&s;tle. The marchione&s;s alone was wretched. She &s;upped with a &s;elect party, in a pavil|lion on the &s;ea &s;hore, which was fitted up with peculi|ar elegance. It was hung with white &s;ilk, drawn up in fe&s;toons, and richly fringed with gold. The &s;ofas were of the &s;ame materials, and alternate wreaths of ro&s;es entwined the columns. A row of &s;mall lamps placed about the cornice, formed an edge of light round the roof, which, with the other numerous lights, was reflected in a blaze of &s;plendor from the large mirrors that adorned the room. The count Muriani was of the party;&mdash;he complimented the marchione&s;s on the beauty of her daughters; and after lamenting with gaiety the captives which their charms would en|thral, he mentioned the count de Vereza, "He is cer|tainly of all others the man mo&s;t de&s;erving the lady Julia. As they danced, I thought they exhibited a
<PB N="24" REF="029381_0023_0FE0D1C3F0B45A70">
perfect model of the beauty of either &s;ex; and if I mi&s;take not, they are in&s;pired with a mutual admirati|on." The marchione&s;s, endeavouring to conceal her unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid, "Yes, my lord, I allow the count all the merit you adjudge him, but from the little I have &s;een of his di&s;po&s;ition, he is too volatile for a &s;erious attachment."&mdash;At that in&s;tant the count entered the pavillion: "Ah, &s;aid Muria|mi, laughingly, you was the &s;ubject of our conver&s;a|tion, and &s;eem to be come in good time to receive the honours alloted you. I was interceding with the mar|chione&s;s for her intere&s;t in your favour, with the lady Julia; but &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;es it; and though &s;he allows you merit, alledges, that you are by nature fickle and incon&s;tant. What &s;ay you&mdash;would not the beauty of lady Julia bind your un&s;teady heart?"</P>
<P>"I know not how I have de&s;erved that character of the marchione&s;s," &s;aid the count, with a &s;mile, "but that heart mu&s;t be either fickle or in&s;en&s;ible in an un|common degree, which can boa&s;t of freedom in the pre&s;ence of lady Julia." The marchione&s;s, mortified by the whole conver&s;ation, now felt the full force of Vereza's reply, which &s;he imagined he pointed with particular empha&s;is.</P>
<P>The entertainment concluded with a grand firework, which was exhibited on the margin of the &s;ea, and the company did not part till the dawn of morning. Ju|lia retired from the &s;cene with regret. She was en|chanted with the new world that was now exhibited to her, and &s;he was not cool enough to di&s;tingui&s;h the vivid glow of imagination from the colours of real bli&s;s. The plea&s;ure &s;he now felt, &s;he believed would always be renewed, and in an equal degree, by the objects which fir&s;t excited it. The weakne&s;s of humanity is never willingly perceived by young minds.
<PB N="25" REF="029381_0024_0FE0D1C894684DE0">
It is painful to know, that we are operated upon by objects who&s;e impre&s;&s;ions are variable as they are inde|finable&mdash;and that what ye&s;terday affected us &s;trongly, is to-day but imperfectly felt, and to-morrow perhaps &s;hall be di&s;regarded. When at length this unwelcome truth is received into the mind, we at fir&s;t reject, with di&s;gu&s;t, every appearance of good, we di&s;dain to partake of a happine&s;s which we cannot always com|mand, and we not unfrequently &s;ink into a temporary de&s;pair. Wi&s;dom or accident at length, recall us from our error, and offers to us &s;ome object capable of pro|ducing a plea&s;ing, yet la&s;ting effect, which effect, therefore, we call happine&s;s. Happine&s;s has this e&s;&s;ential difference from what is commonly called plea&s;|ure; that virtue forms its ba&s;is, and virtue being the offspring of rea&s;on, may be expected to pro|duce uniformity of effect.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions which had hitherto lain concealed in Julia's heart, touched by circum&s;tance, dilated to its power, and afforded her a &s;light experience of the pain and delight which flow from their influence. The beauty and accompli&s;hments of Vereza, rai&s;ed in her a new and various emotion, which reflexion made her fear to encourage, but which was too plea&s;ing to be wholly re&s;i&s;ted. Tremblingly alive to a &s;en&s;e of de|light, and unchilled by di&s;appointment, the young heart welcomes every feeling, not &s;imply painful, with a romantic expectation, that it will expand into bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Julia &s;ought with eager anxiety to di&s;cover the &s;en|timents of Vereza towards her; &s;he revolved each cir|cum&s;tance of the day, but they afforded her little &s;a|tisfaction; they reflected only a glimmering and un|certain light, which in&s;tead of guiding, &s;erved only to perplex her. Now &s;he remembered &s;ome in&s;tance of particular attention, and then &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me mark of appa|rent
<PB N="26" REF="029381_0025_0FE0D1CE0B361630">
indifference. She compared his conduct with that of the other young noble&s;&s;e; and thought each ap|peared equally de&s;irous of the favour of every lady pre&s;ent. All the ladies, however, appeared to her to court the admiration of Vere&s;a, and &s;he trembled le&s;t he &s;hould be too &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;tinction. She drew from the&s;e reflexions no po&s;itive inference; and though di&s;tru&s;t rendered pain the predominant &s;en&s;a|tion, it was exqui&s;itely interwoven with delight, that &s;he could not wi&s;h it exchanged for her former ea&s;e. Thoughtful and re&s;tle&s;s, &s;leep fled from her eyes, and &s;he longed with impatience for the morning, which &s;hould again pre&s;ent Vereza, and enable her to pur&s;ue the inquiry. She aro&s;e early, and adorned her&s;elf with unu&s;ual care. In her favourite clo&s;et &s;he awaited the hour of breakfa&s;t, and endeavoured to read, but her thoughts wandered from the &s;ubject. Her lute and favourite airs lo&s;t half their power to plea&s;e; the day &s;eemed to &s;tand &s;till&mdash;&s;he became melancholy, and thought the breakfa&s;t hour would never arrive. At length the clock &s;truck the &s;ignal, the &s;ound vibrated on every nerve, and trembling &s;he quitted the clo&s;et for her &s;i&s;ter's apartment. Love taught her di&s;gui&s;e. Till then Emilia had &s;hared all her thoughts; they now de&s;cended to the breakfa&s;t room in &s;ilence, and Julia almo&s;t feared to meet her eye. In the breakfa&s;t room they were alone. Julia found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport a conver&s;ation with Emilia, who&s;e ob&s;ervati|ons interrupting the cour&s;e of her thoughts, became unintere&s;ting and tire&s;ome. She was therefore about to retire to her clo&s;et, when the marquis entered. His air was haughty, and his look &s;evere. He coldly &s;a|luted his daughters, and they had &s;carcely time to re|ply to his general inquiries, when the marchione&s;s en|tered,
<PB N="27" REF="029381_0026_0FE0D1D5C5E72390">
and company &s;oon after a&s;&s;embled. Julia, who had awaited with &s;o painful an impatience for the mo|ment which &s;hould pre&s;ent Vereza to her &s;ight, now &s;ighed that it was arrived. She &s;carcely dared to lift her timid eyes from the ground, and when by accident they met his, a &s;oft tremour &s;eized her; and apprehen|&s;ion, le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;cover her &s;entiments, &s;erved only to render her confu&s;ion con&s;picuous. At length a glance from the marchione&s;s recalled her bewildered thoughts; and other fears &s;uper&s;eding tho&s;e of love, her mind, by degrees, recovered its dignity. She could di&s;tingui&s;h in the behaviour of Vereza no &s;ymp|toms of particular admiration, and &s;he re&s;olved to con|duct her&s;elf towards him with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous care.</P>
<P>This day, like the preceding one, was devoted to joy. In the evening there was a concert, which was chiefly performed by the nobility. Ferdinand played the violincello, Vereza the german flute, and Julia the piano forte, which &s;he touched with a delicacy and ex|ecution that engaged every auditor. The confu&s;ion of Julia may be ea&s;ily imagined, when Ferdinand, &s;e|lecting a beautiful duet, de&s;ired Vereza would accom|pany his &s;i&s;ter. The pride of con&s;cious excellence, however, quickly overcame her timidity, and enabled her to exert all her power. The air was &s;imple and pathetic, and &s;he gave it tho&s;e charms of expre&s;&s;ion &s;o peculiarly her own. She &s;truck the chords of her piano forte in beautiful accompaniment, and towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd &s;tanza, her voice re&s;ting on one note, &s;welled into a tone &s;o exqui&s;ite, and from thence de&s;cended to a few &s;imple notes, which &s;he touched with &s;uch impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s that every eye wept to the &s;ounds. The breath of the flute trembled, and
<PB N="28" REF="029381_0027_0FE0D1DB90F070E8">
Hippolitus entranced, forgot to play. A pau&s;e of &s;i|lence en&s;ued at the conclu&s;ion of the piece, and con|tinued till a general &s;igh &s;eemed to awaken the audi|ence from their enchantment. Amid the general ap|plau&s;e, Hippolitus was &s;ilent. Julia ob&s;erved his be|haviour, and gently rai&s;ing her eyes to his, there read the &s;entiments which &s;he had in&s;pired. An exqui&s;ite emotion thrilled her heart, and &s;he experienced one of tho&s;e rare moments which illumine life with a ray of bli&s;s, by which the darkne&s;s of its general &s;hade is con|tra&s;ted. Care, doubt, every di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation vani&s;hed, and for the remainder of the evening &s;he was con&s;cious only of delight. A timid re&s;pect marked the manner of Hippolitus, more flattering to Julia than the mo&s;t ardent profe&s;&s;ions. The evening con|cluded with a ball, and Julia was again the partner of the count.</P>
<P>When the ball broke up, &s;he retired to her apart|ment, but not to &s;leep. Joy is as re&s;tle&s;s as anxiety or &s;orrow. She &s;eemed to have entered upon a new &s;tate of exi&s;tence;&mdash;tho&s;e fine &s;prings of affection which had hitherto lain concealed, were now touched, and yielded to her a happine&s;s more exalted than any her imagination had ever painted. She reflected on the tranquillity of her pa&s;t life, and comparing it with the emotions of the pre&s;ent hour, exulted in the difference. All her former plea&s;ures now appeared in&s;ipid; &s;he wondered that they ever had power to affect her, and that &s;he had endured with content the dull uniformity to which &s;he had been condemned. It was now only that &s;he appeared to live. Ab&s;orbed in the &s;ingle idea of being beloved, her imagination &s;oared into the re|gions of romantic bli&s;s, and bore her high above the po&s;&s;ibility of evil. Since &s;he was beloved by Hippo|litus, &s;he could only be happy.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="029381_0028_0FE0D1DF2F47FD18">From this &s;tate of entranced delight, &s;he was awaken|ed by the &s;ound of mu&s;ic immediately under her win|dow. It was a lute touched by a ma&s;terly hand. Af|ter a wild and melancholy &s;ymphony, a voice of more than magic expre&s;&s;ion &s;welled into an air &s;o pathetic and tender, that it &s;eemed to breathe the very &s;oul of love. The chords of the lute were &s;truck in low and &s;weet accompaniment, Julia li&s;tened, and di&s;tingui&s;h|ed the following words:
<Q><TEXT>

<P>An interval of &s;ilence followed, and the air was re|peated; after which the mu&s;ic was heard no more. If before Julia believed that &s;he was loved by Hippoli|tus, &s;he was now confirmed in the &s;weet reality. But &s;leep at length fell upon her &s;en&s;es, and the airy forms of ideal bli&s;s no longer flected before her imagination. Morning came, and &s;he aro&s;e light and refre&s;hed. How different were her pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations from tho&s;e of the preceding day. Her anxiety had now evapor|ated in joy, and &s;he experienced that airy dance of &s;pirits which accumulated delight from every object; and with a power like the touch of enchantment, can transform a gloomy de&s;ert into a &s;miling Eden. She flew to the breakfa&s;t room, &s;carcely con&s;cious of mo|tion; but, as &s;he entered it, a &s;oft confu&s;ion overcame
<PB N="30" REF="029381_0029_0FE0D1E5EA3275B0">
her; &s;he blu&s;hed, and almo&s;t feared to meet the eyes of Vereza. She was pre&s;ently relieved, however, for the count was not there. The company a&s;&s;embled&mdash; Julia watched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e entrance of every per&s;on with pain|ful anxiety, but he for whom &s;he looked did not ap|pear. Surpri&s;ed and unea&s;y, &s;he fixed her eyes on the door, and whenever it opened, her heart beat with an expectation which was as often checked by di&s;appointment. In &s;pite of all her efforts her vi|vacity &s;unk into languor, and &s;he then perceived that love may produce other &s;en&s;ations than tho&s;e of delight. She found it po&s;&s;ible to be unhappy, though loved by Hippolitus; and acknowledged with a &s;igh of regret, which was yet new to her, how trembling|ly her peace depended upon him. He neither appear|ed nor was mentioned at breakfa&s;t; but though deli|cacy prevented her inquiring after him, conver&s;ation &s;oon became irk&s;ome to her, and &s;he retired to the apartment of Madame de Menon. There &s;he employ|ed her&s;elf in painting, and endeavoured to beguile the time till the hour of dinner, when &s;he hoped to &s;ee Hippolitus. Madame was as u&s;ual, friendly and cheerful, but &s;he perceived a re&s;erve in the conduct of Julia, and penetrated without difficulty into its cau&s;e. She was, however, ignorant of the object of her pu|pil's admiration. The hour &s;o eagerly de&s;ired by Julia at length arrived, and with a palpitating heart &s;he en|tered the hall. The count was not there, and in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, &s;he learned that he had that morning &s;ailed for Naples. The &s;cene which &s;o late|ly appeared enchanting to her eyes, now changed its hue; and in the mid&s;t of &s;ociety, and &s;urrounded by gaiety, &s;he was &s;olitary and dejected. She accu&s;ed her&s;elf of having &s;uffered her wi&s;hes to mi&s;lead her
<PB N="31" REF="029381_0030_0FE0D1EAA59FED70">
judgment; and the pre&s;ent conduct of Hippolitus convinced her, that &s;he had mi&s;taken admiration, for a &s;entiment more tender. She believed too, that the mu&s;ician who had addre&s;&s;ed her in his &s;onnet, was not the count; and thus at once was di&s;&s;olved all the ide|al fabrick of her happine&s;s. How &s;hort a period of|ten rever&s;es the character of our &s;entiments, rendering that which ye&s;terday we de&s;pi&s;ed, to day de&s;irable. The tranquil &s;tate which &s;he had &s;o lately delighted to quit, &s;he now reflected upon with regret. She had, however, the con&s;olation of believing that her &s;entiments towards the count were unknown, and the &s;weet con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that her conduct had been govern|ed by a nice &s;en&s;e of propriety.</P>
<P>The public rejoicings at the ca&s;tle clo&s;ed with the week; but the gay &s;pirit of the marchione&s;s forbade a return to tranquillity; and &s;he &s;ub&s;tituted diver&s;ions more private, but in &s;plendour &s;carcely inferior to the preceding ones. She had ob&s;erved the behaviour of Hippolitus on the night of the concert with chagrin, and his departure with &s;orrow; yet di&s;daining to per|petuate misfortunes by reflexion, &s;he &s;ought to lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of di&s;appointment in the hurry of di&s;&s;ipati|on. But her efforts to era&s;e him from her remembrance were ineffectual. Unaccu&s;tomed to oppo&s;e the bent of her inclinations, they now maintained unbounded &s;way; and &s;he found too late, that in order to have a due command of our pa&s;&s;ions, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub|ject them to early obedience. Pa&s;&s;ion, in its undue influence, produces weakne&s;s as well as inju&s;tice. The pain which now recoiled upon her heart from di&s;ap|pointment, &s;he had not &s;trength of mind to endure, and &s;he &s;ought relief from its pre&s;&s;ure in afflicting the innocent. Julia, who&s;e beauty &s;he imagined had capti|vated
<PB N="32" REF="029381_0031_0FE0D1F0193B7130">
the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and confirmed him in indifference to|wards her&s;elf, &s;he ince&s;&s;antly tormented by the exer|ci&s;e of tho&s;e various and &s;plenetic little arts, which elude the eye of the common ob&s;erver, and are only to be known by tho&s;e who have felt them. Arts, which individually are incon&s;iderable, but in the ag|gregate, amount to a cruel and deci&s;ive effect.</P>
<P>From Julia's mind the idea of happine&s;s was now faded. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lea&s;ure had withdrawn her beam from the pro&s;pect, and the objects no longer illumined by her ray, became dark and colourle&s;s. As often as her &s;ituation would permit, &s;he withdrew from &s;ociety, and &s;ought the freedom of &s;olitude, where &s;he could indulge in melancholy thoughts, and give a loo&s;e to that de&s;pair which is &s;o apt to follow the di&s;appoint|ment of our fir&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>Week after week elap&s;ed, yet no mention was made of returning to Naples. The marquis at length de|clared it his intention to &s;pend the remainder of the &s;ummer in the ca&s;tle. To this determination the marchione&s;s &s;ubmitted with decent re&s;ignation, for &s;he was here &s;urrounded by a croud of flatterers, and and her invention &s;upplied her with continual diver&s;i|ons: that gaiety which rendered Naples &s;o dear to her, glittered in the woods of Mazzini, and re&s;ound|ed through the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The apartments of Madame de Menon were &s;paci|ous and noble. The windows opened upon the &s;ea, and commanded a view of the &s;traits of Me&s;&s;ina, bounded on one &s;ide by the beautiful &s;hores of the i&s;le of Sicily, and on the other by the high mountains of Calabria. The &s;traits filled with ve&s;&s;els who&s;e gay &s;treamers glittered to the &s;un beam, pre&s;ented to the eye an ever moving &s;cene. The principal room opened upon a gallery that overhung the grand terrace of
<PB N="33" REF="029381_0032_0FE0D1F5340F29E8">
the ca&s;tle, and it commanded a pro&s;pect which for beauty and extent has &s;eldom been equalled. The&s;e were formerly con&s;idered the chief apartments of the ca&s;tle; and when the marquis quitted them for Naples, were alotted for the re&s;idence of Madame de Menon, and her young charge. The marchione&s;s, &s;truck with the pro&s;pect which the windows afforded, and the plea&s;antne&s;s of the gallery, determined to re&s;tore the rooms to their former &s;plendour. She &s;ignified this intention to Madame, for whom other apartments were provided. The chambers of Emilia and Julia forming part of the &s;uite, they were al&s;o claimed by the marchione&s;s, who left Julia only her favourite clo|&s;et. The rooms to which they removed, were &s;paci|ous but gloomy; they had been for &s;ome years unin|habited; and though preparations had been made for the reception of their new inhabitants, an air of de|&s;olation reigned within them that in&s;pired melancholy &s;en&s;ations. Julia ob&s;erved that her chamber, which opened beyond Madame's, formed a part of the &s;ou|thern building, with which, however, there appeared no means of communication. The late my&s;terious circum&s;tances relating to this part of the fabrick, now aro&s;e to her imagination, and conjured up a terror which rea&s;on could not &s;ubdue. She told her emoti|ons to Madame, who, with more prudence than &s;ince|rity, laughed at her fears. The behaviour of the marquis, the dying words of Vincent, together with the preceding circum&s;tances of alarm, had &s;unk deep in the mind of Madame, but &s;he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of confining to her own brea&s;t, doubts which time only could re&s;olve.</P>
<P>Julia endeavoured to reconcile her&s;elf to the change, and a circum&s;tance &s;oon occurred which obliterated
<PB N="34" REF="029381_0033_0FE0D1FAA1D51260">
her pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations, and excited others far more in|tere&s;ting. One day that &s;he was arranging &s;ome pa|pers in the &s;mall drawers of a cabinet that &s;tood in her apartment, &s;he found a picture which fixed all her attention. It was a miniature of a lady, who&s;e coun|tenance was touched with &s;orrow, and expre&s;&s;ed an air of dignified re&s;ignation. The mournful &s;weetne&s;s of her eyes, rai&s;ed towards Heaven with a look of &s;upplication, and the melancholy languor that &s;haded her features, &s;o deeply affected Julia, that her eyes were filled with involuntary tears. She &s;ighed and wept, &s;till gazing on the picture, which &s;eemed to engage her by a kind of fa&s;cination. She almo&s;t fan|cied that the portrait breathed, and that the eyes were fixed on her's with a look of penetrating &s;oftne&s;s. Full of the emotions which the miniature had excited, &s;he pre&s;ented it to Madame, who&s;e mingled &s;orrow and &s;urpri&s;e increa&s;ed her curio&s;ity. But what were the various &s;en&s;ations which pre&s;&s;ed upon her heart, on learning that &s;he had wept over the re&s;emblance of her mother! Deprived of a mother's tenderne&s;s before &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of its value, it was now only that &s;he mourned the event which lamentation could not recall. Emilia, with an emotion as exqui&s;ite, mingled her tears with tho&s;e of her &s;i&s;ter. With eager impatience they pre&s;&s;ed Madame to di&s;clo&s;e the cau&s;e of that &s;or|row which &s;o emphatically marked the features of their mother.</P>
<P>"Alas! my dear children," &s;aid Madame, deeply &s;ighing, "you engage me in a ta&s;k too &s;evere, not only for your peace, but for mine; &s;ince in giving you the information you require, I mu&s;t retrace &s;cenes of my own life, which I wi&s;h for ever obliterated. It would however, be both cruel and unju&s;t to with-hold
<PB N="35" REF="029381_0034_0FE0D1FFE019D988">
an explanation &s;o nearly intere&s;ting to you, and I will &s;acrifice my own ea&s;e to your wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a de Bernini, your mother, was as you well know, the only daughter of the count de Bernini. Of the misfortunes of your family, I believe you are yet ignorant. The chief e&s;tates of the count were &s;itua|ted in the <HI>Val di Demona,</HI> a valley deriving its name from its vicinity to Mount Aetna, which vulgar tradi|tion has peopled with devils. In one of tho&s;e dread|ful eruptions of Aetna, which deluged this valley with a flood of fire, a great part of your grandfather's do|mains in that quarter were laid wa&s;te. The count was at that time with a part of his family at Me&s;&s;ina, but the counte&s;s and her &s;on, who were in the country, were de&s;troyed. The remaining property of the count was proportionably incon&s;iderable, and the lo&s;s of his wife and &s;on deeply affected him. He retired with Loui&s;a, his only &s;urviving child, who was then near fifteen, to a &s;mall e&s;tate near Catania. There was &s;ome degree of relation&s;hip between your grandfather and my&s;elf; and your mother was attached to me by the ties of &s;entiment, which, as we grew up, united us &s;till more &s;trongly than tho&s;e of blood. Our plea|&s;ures and our ta&s;tes were the &s;ame; and a &s;imilarity of misfortunes might, perhaps, contribute to cement our early friend&s;hip. I, like her&s;elf, had lo&s;t a parent in the eruption of Aetna. My mother had died before I under&s;tood her value, but my father, whom I rever|ed and tenderly loved, was de&s;troyed by one of tho&s;e terrible events; his lands were buried beneath the lava, and he left an only &s;on and my&s;elf to mourn his fate, and encounter the evils of poverty. The count, who, was our neare&s;t &s;urviving relation, generou&s;ly took us home to his hou&s;e, and declared that he con&s;idered us
<PB N="36" REF="029381_0035_0FE0D2056BAB42A0">
as his children. To amu&s;e his lei&s;ure hours, he un|dertook to fini&s;h the education of my brother, who was then about &s;eventeen, and who&s;e ri&s;ing genius promi&s;ed to reward the labours of the count. Loui&s;a and my&s;elf often &s;hared the in&s;truction of her father, and at tho&s;e hours Orlando was generally of the party. The tranquil retirement of the count's &s;ituation, the rational employment of his time between his own &s;tu|dies, the education of tho&s;e whom he called his chil|dren, and the conver&s;ation of a few &s;elect friends, anticipated the effect of time, and &s;oftened the a&s;peri|ties of his di&s;tre&s;s into a tender complacent melancho|ly. As for Loui&s;a and my&s;elf, who were yet new in life, and who&s;e &s;pirits po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the happy ela&s;ticity of youth, our minds gradually &s;hifted from &s;uffering to tranquillity, and from tranquillity to happine&s;s. I have &s;ometimes thought that when my brother has been reading to her a delightful pa&s;&s;age, the counte|nance of Loui&s;a di&s;covered a tender intere&s;t, which &s;eemed to be excited rather by the reader than by the author. The&s;e days, which were &s;urely the mo&s;t en|viable of our lives, now pa&s;&s;ed in &s;erene enjoyments, and in continual gradations of improvement.</P>
<P>"The count de&s;igned my brother for the army, and the time now drew nigh when he was to join the Sicilian regiment, in which he had a commi&s;&s;ion. The ab&s;ent thoughts, and dejected &s;pirits of my cou|&s;in, now di&s;covered to me the &s;ecret which had long been concealed even from her&s;elf; for it was not till Orlando was about to depart, that &s;he perceived how dear he was to her peace. On the eve of his departure, the count lamented with fatherly, yet manly tender|ne&s;s, the di&s;tance which was &s;oon to &s;eparate us. "But we &s;hall meet again," &s;aid he,
<Q>when the ho|nours of war &s;hall have rewarded the bravery of my

&s;on.</Q>
Loui&s;a grew pale, a half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;igh e&s;caped her, and to conceal her emotion &s;he turned to her harp&s;icord.</P>
<P>"My brother had a favourite dog which, before he &s;et off, he pre&s;ented to Loui&s;a, and committing it to her care, begged &s;he would be kind to it, and &s;ometimes remember its ma&s;ter. He checked his ri|&s;ing emotion, but as he turned from her, I perceived the tear that wetted his cheek. He departed, and with him the &s;pirit of our happine&s;s &s;eemed to evapo|rate. The &s;eenes which his pre&s;ence had formerly en|livened, were now forlorn and melancholy, yet we loved to wander in what were once his favourite haunts. Loui&s;a forbore to mention my brother even to me, but frequently when &s;he thought her&s;elf unob|&s;erved, &s;he would &s;teal to her harp&s;icord, and repeat the &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n which &s;he had played on the evening before his departure.</P>
<P>"We had the plea&s;ure to hear from time to time that he was well; and though his own mode&s;ty threw a veil over his conduct, we could collect from other ac|counts that he had behaved with great bravery. At length the time of his return approached, and the en|livened &s;pirits of Loui&s;a declared the influence he re|retained in her heart. He returned bearing public te&s;timony of his valour in the honours which had been conferred upon him. He was received with univer&s;al joy; the count welcomed him with the pride and fond|ne&s;s of a father, and the villa became again the &s;eat of happine&s;s. His per&s;on and manners were much improv|ed; the elegant beauty of the youth was now exchanged for the graceful dignity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> manhood, and &s;ome know|ledge of the world was added to that of the &s;ciences. The joy which illumined his countenance when he met Loui&s;a, &s;poke at once his admiration and his love;
<PB N="38" REF="029381_0037_0FE0D210F7BF3998">
and the blu&s;h which her ob&s;ervation of it brought upon her cheek, would have di&s;covered even to an uninter|e&s;ted &s;pectator that this joy was mutual.</P>
<P>"Orlando brought with him a young Frenchman, a brother officer, who had re&s;cued him from imminent danger in battle, and whom he introduced to the count as his pre&s;erver. The count received him with grati|tude and di&s;tinction, and he was for a con&s;iderable time an inmate at the villa. His manners were &s;ingu|larly plea&s;ing, and his under&s;tanding was cultivated and refined. He &s;oon di&s;covered a partiality for me, and he was indeed too plea&s;ing to be &s;een with indifference. Gratitude for the valuable life he had pre&s;erved, was perhaps the ground work of an e&s;teem which &s;oon in|crea&s;ed into the mo&s;t affectionate love. Our attach|ment grew &s;tronger as our acquaintance increa&s;ed; and at length the chevalier de Menon a&s;ked me of the count, who con&s;ulted my heart, and finding it favoura|ble to the connexion, proceeded to make the nece&s;&s;ary inquiries concerning the family of the &s;tranger. He obtained a &s;atisfactory and plea&s;ing account of it. The chevalier was the &s;econd &s;on of a French gentle|man of large e&s;tates in France, who had been &s;ome years decea&s;ed. He had left &s;everal &s;ons; the family e&s;tate, of cour&s;e, devolved to the elde&s;t, but to the two younger he had bequeathed con&s;iderable property. Our marriage was &s;olemnized in a private manner at the villa, in the pre&s;ence of the count, Loui&s;a, and my brother. Soon after the nuptials, my hu&s;band and Or|lando were remanded to their regiments. My bro|ther's affections were now unalterably fixed upon Loui&s;a, but a &s;entiment of delicacy and genero&s;ity &s;till kept him &s;ilent. He thought, poor as he was, to &s;o|licit the hand of Loui&s;a, would be to repay the kind|ne&s;s of the count with ingratitude. I have &s;een the
<PB N="39" REF="029381_0038_0FE0D2148F358248">
inward &s;truggles of his heart, and mine has bled for him. The count and Loui&s;a &s;o earne&s;tly &s;olicited me to remain at the villa during the campaign, that at length my hu&s;band con&s;ented. We parted&mdash;O! let me forget that period!&mdash;Had I accompanied him, all might have been well; and the long&mdash;long years of affliction which followed had been &s;pared me."</P>
<P>The horn now &s;ounded the &s;ignal for dinner, and interrupted the narrative of Madame. Her beauteous auditors wiped the tears from their eyes, and with ex|treme reluctance de&s;cended to the hall. The day was occupied with company and diver&s;ions, and it was not till late in the evening that they were &s;uffered to retire. They ha&s;tened to Madame immediately upon their be|ing relea&s;ed; and too much intere&s;ted for &s;leep, and too importunate to be repul&s;ed, &s;olicited the &s;equel of her &s;tory. She objected the latene&s;s of the hour, but at length yielded to their entreaties. They drew their chairs clo&s;e to her's; and every &s;en&s;e being ab&s;orbed in the &s;ingle one of hearing, followed her through the cour&s;e of her narrative.</P>
<P>"My brother again departed without di&s;clo&s;ing his &s;entiments; the effort it co&s;t him was evident, but his &s;en&s;e of honour &s;urmounted every oppo&s;ing con&s;idera|tion. Loui&s;a again drooped, and pined in &s;ilent &s;or|row. I lamented equally for my friend and my bro|ther; and have a thou&s;and times accu&s;ed that delicacy as fal&s;e, which with-held them from the happine&s;s they might &s;o ea&s;ily and &s;o innocently have obtained. The behaviour of the count, at lea&s;t to my eye, &s;eemed to indicate the &s;atisfaction which this union would have given him. It was about this period that the marquis Mazzini fir&s;t &s;aw and became enamoured of Loui&s;a. His propo&s;als were very flattering, but the count for|bore
<PB N="40" REF="029381_0039_0FE0D21B1F07AE08">
to exert the undue authority of a father; and he cea&s;ed to pre&s;s the connexion, when he perceived that Loui&s;a was really aver&s;e to it. Loui&s;a was &s;en&s;ible of the genero&s;ity of his conduct, and &s;he could &s;carcely re|ject the alliance without a &s;igh, which her gratitude paid to the kindne&s;s of her father.</P>
<P>"But an event now happened which di&s;&s;olved at once our happine&s;s, and all our air drawn &s;chemes for futurity. A di&s;pute, which it &s;eems originated in a trifle, but &s;oon increa&s;ed to a &s;erious degree, aro&s;e be|tween the <HI>Chevalier de Menon</HI> and my brother. It was decided by the &s;word, and my dear brother fell by the hand of my hu&s;band. I &s;hall pa&s;s over this period of my life. It is too painful for recollection. The effect of this event upon Loui&s;a was &s;uch as may be imagined. The world was now become indifferent to her, and as &s;he had no pro&s;pect of happine&s;s for her|&s;elf, &s;he was unwilling to with-hold it from the father who had de&s;erved &s;o much of her. After &s;ome time, when the marquis renewed his addre&s;&s;es, &s;he gave him her hand. The characters of the marquis and his lady were in their nature too oppo&s;ite to form a happy union. Of this Loui&s;a was very &s;oon &s;en&s;ible; and though the mildne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition made her tamely &s;ubmit to the unfeeling authority of her hu&s;band, his behavi|our &s;unk deep in her heart, and &s;he pined in &s;ecret. It was impo&s;&s;ible for her to avoid oppo&s;ing the charact|er of the marquis to that of him upon whom her affec|tions had been &s;o fondly and &s;o ju&s;tly fixed. The compari&s;on increa&s;ed her &s;ufferings, which &s;oon preyed upon her con&s;titution, and very vi&s;ibly affected her health. Her &s;ituation deeply afflicted the count, and united with the infirmities of age to &s;horten his life.</P>
<P>"Upon his death, I bade ad eu to my cou&s;in, and and quitted Sicily for Italy, where the Chevalier de
<PB N="41" REF="029381_0040_0FE0D22173498058">
Menon had for &s;ome time expected me. Our meeting was very affecting. My re&s;entment towards him was done away, when I ob&s;erved his pale and altered coun|tenance, and perceived the melancholy which preyed upon his heart. All the airy vivacity of his former manner was fled, and he was devoured by unavailing grief and remor&s;e. He deplored with uncea&s;ing &s;or|row the friend he had murdered, and my pre&s;ence &s;eemed to open afre&s;h the wounds which time had be|gun to clo&s;e. His affliction, united with my own, was almo&s;t more than I could &s;upport, but I was doomed to &s;uffer, and endure yet more. In a &s;ub&s;equent en|gagement my hu&s;band, weary of exi&s;tence, ru&s;hed into the heat of battle, and there obtained an honourable death. In a paper which he left behind him, he &s;aid it was his intention to die in that battle: that he had long wi&s;hed for death, and waited for an opportunity of obtaining it without &s;taining his own character by the cowardice of &s;uicide, or di&s;tre&s;&s;ing me by an act of butchery. This event gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to my afflictions;&mdash;yet let me retract:&mdash;another misfortune awaited me when I lea&s;t expected one. The <HI>Chevalier de Menon</HI> died without a will, and his brothers refu&s;ed to give up his e&s;tate, unle&s;s I could produce a witne&s;s of my marriage. I returned to Sicily, and to my in|expre&s;&s;ible &s;orrow found that your mother had died during my &s;tay abroad, a prey, I fear, to grief. The prie&s;t who performed the ceremony of my marriage, having been threatened with puni&s;hment for &s;ome ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical offences, had &s;ecretly left the country; and thus was I deprived of tho&s;e proofs which were nece&s;|&s;ary to authenticate my claims to the e&s;tates of my hu&s;band. His brothers, to whom I was an utter &s;tranger, were either too prejudiced to believe, or be|lieving, were too di&s;honourable to acknowledge the
<PB N="42" REF="029381_0041_0FE0D226196D8D50">
ju&s;tice of my ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ims. I was therefore at once abandon|ed to &s;orrow and to poverty; a &s;mall legacy from the count de Bernini being all that now remained to me.</P>
<P>"When the marquis married Maria de Vellorno, which was about this period, he de&s;igned to quit Maz|zini for Naples. His &s;on was to accompany him, but, it was his intention to leave you, who were both very young, to the care of &s;ome per&s;on qualified to &s;uper|intend your education. My circum&s;tances rendered the office acceptable, and my former friend&s;hip for your mother made the duty plea&s;ing to me. The mar|quis, was, I believe, glad to be &s;cared the trouble of &s;earching further for what he had hitherto found it difficult to obtain&mdash;a per&s;on whom inclination as well as duty would bind to his intere&s;t."</P>
<P>Madame cea&s;ed to &s;peak, and Emilia and Julia wept to the memory of the mother, who&s;e misfortunes this &s;tory recorded. The &s;ufferings of Madame, together with her former friend&s;hip for the late marchione&s;s, endeared her to her pupils, who from this period en|deavoured by every kind and delicate attention to ob|literate the traces of her &s;orrows. Madame was &s;en&s;i|ble of this tenderne&s;s, and it was productive in &s;ome de|gree of the effect d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed. But a &s;ubject &s;oon after occurred, which draw off their minds from the con&s;i|deration of their mother's fate to a &s;ubject more won|derful and equally intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>One night that Emilia and Julia had been detained, by company, in ceremonial re&s;traint, later than u&s;ual, they were induced by the ea&s;y conver&s;ation of Ma|dame, and by the plea&s;ure which a return to liberty naturally produces to defer the hour of repo&s;e till the night was far advanced. They were engaged in inter|e&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e, when Madame, who was then &s;peak|ing, was interrupted by a low hollow &s;ound, which
<PB N="43" REF="029381_0042_0FE0D22EDABCE4F8">
aro&s;e from beneath the apartment, and &s;eemed like the clo&s;ing of a door. Chilled into a &s;ilence, they li&s;ten|ed and di&s;tinctly heard it repeated. Deadly ideas crowded upon their imaginations, and in&s;pired a ter|ror which &s;carcely allowed them to breathe. The noi&s;e la&s;ted only for a moment, and a profound &s;ilence &s;oon en&s;ued. Their feelings at length relaxed, and &s;uf|fered them to move to Madame's apartment, when again they heard the &s;ame &s;ounds. Almo&s;t di&s;tracted with fear, they ru&s;hed into Madame's apartment, where Emilia &s;unk upon the bed and fainted. It was a con&s;iderable time ere the efforts of Madame recalled her to &s;en&s;ation. When they were again tranquil, &s;he employed all her endeavours to compo&s;e the &s;pirits of the young ladies, and di&s;&s;uade them from alarming the ca&s;tle. Involved in dark and fearful doubts, &s;he yet commanded her feelings, and endeavoured to a&s;|&s;ume an appearance of compo&s;ure. The late behaviour of the marquis had convinced her that he was nearly connected with the my&s;tery which hung over this part of the edifice; and &s;he dreaded to excite his re&s;entment by a further mention of alarms, which were perhaps only ideal, and who&s;e reality &s;he had certainly no means of proving.</P>
<P>Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;he endeavoured to prevail on Emilia and Julia, to await in &s;ilence &s;ome confirmation of their &s;urmi&s;es, but their terror made this a very difficult ta&s;k. They acquie&s;ced, however, &s;o far with her wi&s;hes, as to agree to conceal the pre|ceding circum&s;tances from every per&s;on but their bro|ther, without who&s;e protecting pre&s;ence they declared it utterly impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s another night in the apart|ments. For the remainder of this night they re&s;olved to watch. To beguile the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the time they endeavoured to conver&s;e, but the minds of Emilia and
<PB N="44" REF="029381_0043_0FE0D23370AE7E70">
Julia were too much affected by the late occurrence to wander from the &s;ubject. They compared this with the foregoing circum&s;tance of the figure and the light which had appeared; their imaginations kindled wild conjectures, and they &s;ubmitted their opinions to Ma|dame, entreating her to inform them &s;incerely, whe|ther &s;he believed that di&s;embodied &s;pirits were ever permitted to vi&s;it this earth.</P>
<P>"My children," &s;aid &s;he, "I will not attempt to per|&s;uade you that the exi&s;tence of &s;uch &s;pirits is impo&s;&s;i|ble. Who &s;hall &s;ay that any thing is impo&s;&s;ible to God? We know that he has made us, who are embo|died &s;pirits; he, therefore, can make unembodied &s;pi|rits. If we cannot under&s;tand how &s;uch &s;pirits exi&s;t, we &s;hould con&s;ider the limited powers of our minds, and that we cannot under&s;tand many things which are indi&s;putably true. No one yet knows why the magnet|ic needle points to the north; yet you, who have never &s;een a magnet, do not he&s;itate to believe that it has this tendency, becau&s;e you have been well a&s;&s;ured of it, both from books and in conver&s;ation. Since, there|fore, we are &s;ure that nothing is impo&s;&s;ible to God, and that &s;uch beings <HI>may</HI> exi&s;t, though we can not tell how, we ought to con&s;ider by what evidence their ex|i&s;tence is &s;upported. I do not &s;ay that &s;pirits <HI>have</HI> ap|peared; but if &s;everal di&s;creet unprejudiced per&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were to a&s;&s;ure me that they had &s;een one, I &s;hould not be proud or bold enough to reply&mdash;"it is impo&s;&s;ible." Let not, however, &s;uch con&s;iderations di&s;turb your minds. I have &s;aid thus much, becau&s;e I was unwilling to impo&s;e upon your under&s;tandings; it is now your part to exerci&s;e your rea&s;on, and pre&s;erve the unmov|ed confidence of virtue. Such &s;pirits, if indeed they have ever been &s;een, can have appeared only by the ex|pre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion of God, and for &s;ome very &s;ingular
<PB N="45" REF="029381_0044_0FE0D2395DBF0168">
purpo&s;es; be a&s;&s;ured that there are no beings who act un&s;een by him; and that, therefore, there are none from whom innocence can ever &s;uffer harm."</P>
<P>No further &s;ounds di&s;turbed them for that time; and before the morning dawned, wearine&s;s in&s;en&s;ibly overcame apprehen&s;ion, and &s;unk them in repo&s;e.</P>
<P>When Ferdinand learned the circum&s;tances relating to the &s;outhern &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, his imagination &s;eiz|ed with avidity each appearance of my&s;tery, and in&s;pir|ed him with an irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;ire to penetrate the &s;e|crets of this de&s;olate part of the fabric. He very rea|dily con&s;ented to watch with his &s;i&s;ters in Julia's apart|ment; but as his chamber was in a remote part of the ca&s;tle, there would be &s;ome difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing unob|&s;erved to her's. It was agreed, however, that when all was hu&s;hed, he &s;hould make the attempt. Having thus re&s;olved, Emilia and Julia waited the return of night with re&s;tle&s;s and fearful impatience.</P>
<P>At length the family retired to re&s;t. The ca&s;tle clock had &s;truck one, and Julia began to fear that Fer|dinand had been di&s;covered, when a knocking was heard at the door of the outer chamber.</P>
<P>Her heart beat with apprehen&s;ions, which rea&s;on could not ju&s;tify. Madame ro&s;e, and inquiring what was there, was an&s;wered by the voice of Ferdinand. The door was cheerfully opened. They drew their chairs round him, and endeavoured to pa&s;s the time in conver&s;ation; but fear and expectation attracted all their thoughts to one &s;ubject, and Madame alone pre|&s;erved her compo&s;ure. The hour was now come when the &s;ounds had been heard the preceding night, and every ear was given to attention. All, however, re|mained quiet, and the night pa&s;&s;ed without any new alarm.</P>
<P>The greater part of &s;everal &s;ucceeding nights were
<PB N="46" REF="029381_0045_0FE0D23F07508730">
&s;pent in watching, but no &s;ounds di&s;turbed their &s;ilence. Ferdinand, in who&s;e mind the late circum&s;tances had excited a degree of a&s;toni&s;hment and curio&s;ity &s;uperior to common ob&s;tacles, determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to gain admittance to tho&s;e rece&s;&s;es of the ca&s;tle which had for &s;o many years been hid from human eye. This, however, was a de&s;ign which we &s;aw little probability of accompli&s;hing, for the keys of that part of the edi|fice were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the marquis, of who&s;e late conduct he judged too well to believe he would &s;uffer the apartments to be explored. He racked his inven|tion for the means of getting acce&s;s to them, and at length recollecting that Julia's chamber formed a part of the&s;e buildings, it occurred to him, that according to the mode of building in old times, there might for|merly have been a communication between them. This con&s;ideration &s;ugge&s;ted to him the po&s;&s;ibility of a concealed door in her apartment, and he determined to &s;urvey it on the following night with great care.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE ca&s;tle was buried in &s;leep when Ferdinand again joined his &s;i&s;ters in Madame's apartment. With anxious curio&s;ity they followed him to the chamber. The room was hung with tape&s;try. Ferdinand care|fully &s;ounded the wall which communicated with the &s;outhern buildings. From one part of it a &s;ound was returned, which convinced him there was &s;omething le&s;s &s;olid than &s;tone. He removed the tape&s;try, and behind it appeared, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, a &s;mall door. With a hand trembling through eager|ne&s;s he undrew the bolts, and was ru&s;hing forward,
<PB N="47" REF="029381_0046_0FE0D244C6766758">
when he perceived that a lock with held his pa&s;&s;age. The keys of Madame and his &s;i&s;ters were applied in vain, and he was compelled to &s;ubmit to di&s;appoint|ment at the very moment when he congratulated him|&s;elf on his &s;ucce&s;s, for he had with him no means of forcing the door.</P>
<P>He &s;tood gazing on the door, and inwardly lament|ing, when a low hollow &s;ound was heard from beneath. Emilia and Julia &s;eized his arm; and almo&s;t &s;inking with apprehen&s;ion, li&s;tened in profound &s;ilence. A foot&s;tep was di&s;tinctly heard, as if pa&s;&s;ing through the apartment below, after which all was &s;till. Ferdinand fired by this confirmation of the late report, ru&s;hed on to the door, and again tried to bur&s;t his way, but it re&s;i&s;ted all the efforts of his &s;trength. The ladies now rejoiced in that circum&s;tance which they &s;o lately lamented; for the &s;ounds had renewed their terror, and though the night pa&s;&s;ed without further di&s;turb|ance, their fears were very little abated.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, who&s;e mind was wholly occupied with wonder, could with difficulty await the return of night. Emilia and Julia were &s;carcely le&s;s impatient. They counted the minutes as they pa&s;&s;ed; and when the fa|mily retired to re&s;t, ha&s;tened with palpitating hearts to the apartment of Madame. They were &s;oon after joined by Ferdinand, who brought with him tools for cutting away the lock of the door. They pau&s;ed a few moments in the chamber in fearful &s;ilence, but no &s;ound di&s;turbed the &s;tillne&s;s of night. Ferdinand ap|plied a knife to the door, and in a &s;hort time &s;epara|ted the lock. The door yielded and di&s;clo&s;ed a large and gloomy gallery. He took a light. Emilia and Julia, fearful of remaining in the chamber, re&s;olved to to accompany him, and each &s;eizing an arm of Madame, they followed in &s;ilence. The gallery was in many
<PB N="48" REF="029381_0047_0FE0D24A2BDE29E0">
parts falling to decay, the cieling was broke, and the window &s;hutters &s;hattered, which, together with the dampne&s;s of the walls, gave the place an air of wild de&s;olation.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed lightly on, for their &s;teps ran in whi&s;|pering echoes through the gallery, and often did Ju|lia ca&s;t a fearful glance around.</P>
<P>The gallery terminated in a large old &s;tair-ca&s;e, which led to a hall below; on the left appeared &s;eve|ral doors which &s;eemed to lead to &s;eparate apartments. While they he&s;itated which cour&s;e to pur&s;ue, a light fla&s;hed faintly up the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and in a moment after pa&s;&s;ed away; at the &s;ame time was heard the &s;ound of a di&s;tant foot&s;tep. Ferdinand drew his &s;word and &s;prang forward; his companions &s;creaming with er|ror, ran back to Madame's apartment.</P>
<P>Ferdinand de&s;cended a large vaulted hall; he cro&s;e|ed it towards a low arched door which was left half open, and through which &s;treamed a ray of light. The door opened upon a narrow winding pa&s;&s;age<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he entered, and the light retiring, was quickly lo&s;t in the windings of the place. Still he went on. The pa&s;&s;age grew narrower, and the frequent fragments of loo&s;e &s;tone, made it now difficult to proceed. A low door clo&s;ed the avenue, re&s;embling that by which he had entered. He opened it, and di&s;covered a &s;quare room, from whence ro&s;e a windng &s;tair ca&s;e, which led up the &s;outh tower of the ca&s;tle. Ferdinand pau|&s;ed to li&s;ten; the &s;ound of &s;teps had cea&s;ed, and all was profoundly &s;ilent. A door on the right attracted his notice; he tried to open it, but it was fa&s;tened. He concluded, therefore, that the per&s;on, if indeed a human being it was that bore the light he had &s;een, had pa&s;&s;ed up the tower. After a momentary he&s;ita|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion,
<PB N="49" REF="029381_0048_0FE0D24DF17C6178">
he determined to a&s;cend the &s;tair-ca&s;e, but its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uinous condition made this an adventure of &s;ome dif|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iculty. The &s;teps were decayed and broken, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oo&s;ene&s;s of the &s;tones rendered a footing very in&s;ecure. Impelled by an irre&s;i&s;tible curio&s;ity, he was undi&s;may|ed and began the a&s;cent. He had not proceeded very far, when the &s;tones of a &s;tep which his foot had ju&s;t quitted, loo&s;ened by his weight, gave way; and drag|ging with them tho&s;e adjoining, formed a cha&s;m in the &s;tair-ca&s;e that terrified even Ferdinand, who was left tottering on the &s;u&s;pended half of the &s;teps, in mo|mentary expectation of falling to the bottom with the &s;tone on which he re&s;ted. In the terror which this oc|ca&s;ioned, he attempted to &s;ave him&s;elf by catching at a kind of beam which projected over the &s;tairs, when the lamp dropped from his hand, and he was left in total darkne&s;s. Terror now u&s;urped the place of eve|ry other intere&s;t, and he was utterly perplexed how to proceed. He feared to go on, le&s;t the &s;teps above, as infirm as tho&s;e below, &s;hould yield to his weight; &mdash;to return was impracticable, for the darkne&s;s pre|cluded the po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;covering a means. He de|termined, therefore, to remain in this &s;ituation till light &s;hould d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> through the narrow grates in the walls, and enable him to contrive &s;ome method of let|ting him&s;elf down to the ground.</P>
<P>He had remained here above an hour, when he &s;ud|denly heard a voice from below. It &s;eemed to come from the pa&s;&s;age leading to the tower, and percepti|bly drew nearer. His agitation was now extreme, for he had no power of defending him&s;elf, and while he remained in this &s;tate of torturing expectation, a blaze of light bur&s;t upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e beneath him. In the &s;ucceeding moment he heard his own name &s;ounded from below. His apprehen&s;ions in&s;tantly vani&s;hed,
<PB N="50" REF="029381_0049_0FE0D253A82CE598">
for he di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices of Madame and his &s;i&s;ters&punc;</P>
<P>They had awaited his return in all the horrors of apprehen&s;ion, till at length all fear for them&s;elves was lo&s;t in tho&s;e concern for him; and they, who &s;o lately had not dared to enter this part of the edifice, now un|dauntedly &s;earched it in que&s;t of Ferdinand. What were their emotions when they di&s;covered his perilous &s;ituation!</P>
<P>The light now enabled him to take a more accurate &s;urvey of the place. He perceived that &s;ome few &s;tones of the &s;teps which had fallen, &s;till remained attached to the wall, but he feared to tru&s;t to their &s;upport on|ly. He ob&s;erved, however, that the wall it&s;elf was partly decayed, and con&s;equently rugged with the corners of half worn &s;tones. On the&s;e &s;mall projec|tions he contrived, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;teps al|ready mentioned, to &s;u&s;pend him&s;elf, and at length gained the unbroken part of the &s;tairs in &s;afety. It is difficult to determine which individual of the party rejoiced mo&s;t at this e&s;cape. The morning now dawn|ed, and Ferdinand de&s;i&s;ted for the pre&s;ent from far|ther inquiry.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t which the&s;e my&s;terious circum&s;tances excited in the mind of Julia, had with-drawn her at|tention from a &s;ubject more dangerous to its peace. The image of Vereza, notwith&s;tanding, would fre|quently intrude upon her fancy; and awakening the recollection of happy emotions, would call forth a &s;igh which all her efforts could not &s;uppre&s;s. She loved to indulge the melancholy of her heart in the &s;olitude of the woods. One evening &s;he took her lute to a favour|ite &s;pot on the &s;ea &s;hore, and re&s;igning her&s;elf in a plea&s;ing &s;adne&s;s, touched &s;ome &s;weet and plaintive airs.

The purple flu&s;h of evening was diffu&s;ed over the heavens. The &s;un, involved in clouds of &s;plendid and innumerable hues, was &s;etting o'er the di&s;tant water, who&s;e clear bo&s;om glowed with rich reflexion. The beauty of the &s;cene, the &s;oothing murmur of the high trees, waved by the light air which over&s;hadowed her, and the &s;oft &s;welling of the waves that flowed gently in upon the &s;hores, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;unk her mind into a &s;tate of repo&s;e.

<P>Having cea&s;ed to &s;ing, her fingers wandered over the lute in melancholy &s;ymphony, and for &s;ome mo|ments &s;he remained lo&s;t in the &s;weet &s;en&s;ations which the mu&s;ic and the &s;cenery had in&s;pired. She was awakened from her reverie, by a &s;igh that &s;tole from among the trees, and directing her eyes whence it came, beheld&mdash;Hippolitus! A thou&s;and &s;weet and mingled emotions pre&s;&s;ed upon her heart, yet &s;he &s;carcely dared to tru&s;t the evidence of &s;ight. He ad|vanced, and throwing him&s;elf at her feet. "Suffer me" &s;aid he, in a tremulous voice, "to di&s;clo&s;e to you the &s;entiments which you have in&s;pired, and to offer you the effu&s;ions of a heart filled only with love and admiration." "Ri&s;e my lord," &s;aid Julia, mov|ing from her &s;eat with an air of dignity, "that atti|tude is neither becoming you to u&s;e, or me to &s;uffer&punc; The evening is clo&s;ing, and Ferdinand will be impati|ent to &s;ee you."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="029381_0052_0FE0D266199967E0">"Never will I ri&s;e, Madam," replied the count, with an impa&s;&s;ioned air, "till."&mdash;He was interrupted by the marchione&s;s who at this moment entered the grove. On ob&s;erving the po&s;ition of the count &s;he was retiring. "Stay Madam," &s;aid Julia, almo&s;t &s;inking under her confu&s;ion. "By no means," re|plied the marchione&s;s, in a tone of irony, "my pre|&s;ence would only interrupt a very agreeable &s;cene. The count, I &s;ee, is willing to pay you his earlie&s;t re|&s;pects." Saying this &s;he di&s;appeared, leaving Julia di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and offended, and the count provoked at the intru&s;ion. He attempted to renew the &s;ubject, but Julia ha&s;tily followed the &s;teps of the marchione&s;s, and entered the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The &s;cene &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, rai&s;ed in the marchio|ne&s;s a tumult of dreadful emotions. Love, hatred, and jealou&s;y, raged by turns in her heart, and defied all power of controul. Subjected to their alternate violence, &s;he experienced a mi&s;ery more acute than any &s;he had yet known. Her imagination, invigorat|ed by oppo&s;ition, heightened to her the graces of Hip|politus; her bo&s;om glowed with more inten&s;e pa&s;&s;ion, and her brain was at length exa&s;perated almo&s;t to madne&s;s.</P>
<P>In Julia this &s;udden and unexpected interview excit|ed a mingled emotion of love and vexation, which did not &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide. At length, however, the delightful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Vereza's love bore her high above every other &s;en&s;ation; again the &s;cene more brightly glow|ed, and again her fancy overcame the po&s;&s;ibility of evil.</P>
<P>During the evening, a tender and timid re&s;pect di&s;|tingui&s;hed the behaviour of the count towards Julia, who, contented with the certainty of being loved, re|&s;olved to conceal her &s;entiments till an explanation of

his abrupt departure from Mazzini, and &s;ub&s;equent ab&s;ence, &s;hould have di&s;&s;ipated the &s;hadow of my&s;tery which hung over this part of his conduct. She ob|&s;erved that the marchione&s;s pur&s;ued her with &s;teady and con&s;tant ob&s;ervation, and &s;he carefully avoided af|fording the count an opportunity of renewing the &s;ub|ject of the preceding interview, which whenever he ap|proached her &s;eemed to tremble on his lips.</P>
<P>Night returned, and Ferdinand repaired to the chamber of Julia to pur&s;ue his inquiry. Here he had not long remained, when the &s;trange and alarming &s;ounds which had been heard on the preceding night were repeated. The circum&s;tance that now &s;unk in terror the minds of Emilia and Julia, fired with new wonder that of Ferdinand, who &s;eizing a light, darted through the di&s;covered door, and almo&s;t in&s;tantly di&s;|appeared.</P>
<P>He de&s;cended into the &s;ame wild hall he had pa&s;&s;ed on the preceding night. He had &s;carcely reached the bottom of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, when a feeble light gleamed acro&s;s the hall, and his eye caught the glimp&s;e of a figure retiring through the low arched door which led to the &s;outh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ower. He drew his &s;word and ru&s;hed on. A faint &s;ound died away along the pa&s;&s;age, the windings of which prevented his &s;eeing the figure he pur&s;ued. Of this, indeed, he had obtained &s;o &s;light a view, that he &s;carcely knew whether it bore the im|pre&s;&s;ion of a human form. The light quickly di&s;ap|peared, and he heard the door that opened upon the tower &s;uddenly clo&s;e. He reached it, and forcing it open, &s;prang forward; but the place was dark and &s;o|litary, and there was no appearance of any per&s;on having pa&s;&s;ed along it. He looked up the tower, and the cha&s;m which the &s;tair-ca&s;e exhibited, convinced him that no human being could have pa&s;&s;ed up. He

&s;tood &s;ilent and amazed; examining the place with an eye of &s;trict inquiry, he perceived a door, which was partly concealed by hanging &s;tairs, and which till now had e&s;caped his notice. Hope invigorated curio&s;ity, but his expectation was quickly di&s;appointed, for this door al&s;o was fa&s;tened. He tried in vain to force it. He knocked, and a hollow &s;ullen &s;ound ran in echoes through the place, and died away at a di&s;tance. It was evident that beyond this door were chambers of con&s;iderable extent, but after long and various at|tempts to reach them, he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and he quitted the tower as ignorant and more di&s;&s;atisfied than he had entered. He returned to the hall, which he now for the fir&s;t time deliberately &s;urveyed. It was a &s;pacious and de&s;olate apartment, who&s;e lofty roof ro&s;e into arches &s;upported by pillars of black marble. The &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance inlaid the floor, and formed the &s;tair-ca&s;e. The windows were high and gothic. An air of proud &s;ublimity, united with &s;ingular wildne&s;s, char|acterized the place, at the extremity of which aro&s;e &s;everal gothic arches, who&s;e dark &s;hade veiled in ob|&s;curity the extent beyond. On the left hand appear|ed two doors, each of which was fa&s;tened, and on the right the grand entrance from the courts. Ferdinand determined to explore the dark rece&s;s which terminated his view, and as he traver&s;ed the hall, his imagination, affected by the &s;urrounding &s;cene, often multiplied the echoes of his foot&s;teps into uncertain &s;ounds of &s;trange and fearful import.</P>
<P>He reached the arches, and di&s;covered beyond a kind of inner hall of con&s;iderable extent, which was clo&s;ed at the farther end by a pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of ma&s;&s;y folding doors, heavily ornamented with carving. They were fa&s;tened by a lock, and defied his utmo&s;t &s;trength.</P>
<P>As he &s;urveyed the place in &s;ilent wonder, a &s;ullen

groan aro&s;e from beneath the &s;pot where he &s;tood. His blood ran cold at the &s;ound, but &s;ilence returning, and continuing unbroken, he attributed his alarm to the illu&s;ion of fancy, which terror had impregnated. He made another effort to force the door when a groan was repeated more hollow, and more dreadful than the fir&s;t. At this moment all his courage for&s;ook him, he quitted the door, and ha&s;tened to the &s;tair-ca&s;e, which he a&s;cended almo&s;t breathle&s;s with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>He found Madame de Menon and his &s;i&s;ters awa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing his return in the mo&s;t painful anxiety; and, thus di&s;appointed in all his endeavours to penetrate the &s;e|cret of the&s;e buildings, and fatigued with fruitle&s;s &s;earch, he re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend farther inquiry.</P>
<P>When he related the circum&s;tances of his late ad|venture, the terror of Emilia and Julia was heightened to a degree that overcame every prudent con&s;ideration. Their apprehen&s;ion of the marquis's di&s;plea&s;ure, was lo&s;t in a &s;tronger feeling, and they re&s;olved no longer to remain in apartments which offered only terrific images to their fancy. Madame de Menon almo&s;t equally alarmed, and more perplexed, by this combi|nation of &s;trange and unaccountable circum&s;tances, cea&s;ed to oppo&s;e their de&s;ign. It was re&s;olved, there|fore, that on the following day, Madame &s;hould ac|quaint the marchione&s;s with &s;uch particulars of the late occurrences as their purpo&s;e made it nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould know, concealing their knowledge of the hid|den door, and the incidents immediately dependant on it; and that Madame &s;hould entreat a change of apartments.</P>
<P>Madame accordingly waited on the marchione&s;s. The marchione&s;s having li&s;tened to the account at fir&s;t with &s;urpri&s;e, and afterwards with indifference, con|de&s;cended to reprove Madame for encouraging &s;uper|&s;titious
<PB N="57" REF="029381_0056_0FE0D27B922E0998">
belief in the minds of her young charge. She concluded with ridiculing as fanciful the circum&s;tances related, and with refu&s;ing, on account of the numer|ous vi&s;itants at the ca&s;tle, the reque&s;t preferred to her.</P>
<P>It is true the ca&s;tle was crowded with vi&s;itors; the former apartments of Madame de Menon were the only ones unoccupied, and the&s;e were in magnificent pre|paration for the plea&s;ure of the marchione&s;s, who was unaccu&s;tomed to &s;acrifice her own wi&s;hes to the com|fort of tho&s;e around her. She therefore treated lightly the &s;ubject, which, &s;eriou&s;ly attended to, could have enda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ered her new plan of delight.</P>
<P>But Emilia and Julia were too &s;eriou&s;ly terrified to obey the &s;cruples of delicacy, or to be ea&s;ily repul&s;ed. They prevailed on Ferdinand to repre&s;ent their &s;itua|tion to the marquis.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Hippolitus, who had pa&s;&s;ed the night in a &s;tate of &s;leeple&s;s anxiety, watched with bu&s;y impa|tience, an opportunity of more fully di&s;clo&s;ing to Julia, the pa&s;&s;ion which glowed in his heart. The fir&s;t mo|ment in which he beheld her, had awakened in him an admiration which had &s;ince ripened into a &s;entiment more tender. He had been prevented formally de|claring his pa&s;&s;ion by the circum&s;tance which &s;o &s;ud|denly called him to Naples. This was the dangerous illne&s;s of the marquis de Lomelli, his near and much valued relation. But it was a ta&s;k too painful to de|part in &s;ilence, and he contrived to inform Julia of his &s;entiments in the air which &s;he heard &s;o &s;weetly &s;ung beneath her window.</P>
<P>When Hippolitus reached Naples the marquis was yet living, but expired a few days after his arrival, leaving the count heir to the &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which remained from the extravagance of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> adju&s;ting his rights had till now de|tained

him from Sicily, whither he came for the &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> purpo&s;e of declaring his love. Here unexpected ob&s;ta|cles awaited him. The jealous vigilance of the mar|chione&s;s, con&s;pired with the delicacy of Julia, to with|hold from him the opportunity he &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought.</P>
<P>When Ferdinand entered upon the &s;ubject of the &s;outhern buildings to the marquis, he carefully avoided mentioning the hidden door. The marquis li&s;tened for &s;ome time to the relation in gloomy &s;ilence, but at length a&s;&s;uming an air of di&s;plea&s;ure, reprehended Ferdinand for yielding his confidence to tho&s;e idle alarms, which he &s;aid were the &s;ugge&s;tions of a timid imagination. "Alarms," continued he, "which will readily find admittance to the weak mind of a wo|man, but which the firmer nature of man &s;hould di&s;|dain. Degenerate boy! Is it thus you reward my care? Do I live to &s;ee my &s;on the &s;port of every idle tale a woman may repeat? Learn to tru&s;t rea&s;on and your &s;en&s;es, and you will then be worthy of my atten|tion."</P>
<P>The marquis was retiring, and Ferdinand now per|ceived it nece&s;&s;ary to declare, that he had him&s;elf wit|ne&s;&s;ed the &s;ounds he mentioned. "Pardon me, my lord," &s;aid he, "in the late in&s;tance I have been ju&s;t to your command&mdash;my &s;en&s;es have been the only evi|dences I have tru&s;ted. I have heard tho&s;e &s;ounds which I can not doubt." The marquis appeared &s;hocked. Ferdinand perceived the change, and urged the &s;ubject &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that the marquis &s;uddenly a&s;&s;uming a look of grave importance, commanded him to attend him in the evenining in his clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Ferdinand in pa&s;&s;ing from the marquis met Hippol|itus. He was pacing the gallery in much &s;eeming agi|tation, but ob&s;erving Ferdinand, he advanced to him "I am ill at heart," &s;aid he, in a melancholy tone&punc;
<PB N="59" REF="029381_0058_0FE0D2879DD67550">
"a&s;&s;i&s;t me with your advice. We will &s;tep into this apartment where we can conver&s;e without interruption."</P>
<P>"You are not ignorant," &s;aid he, throwing him|&s;elf into a chair, "of the tender &s;entiments which your &s;i&s;ter Julia has in&s;pired. I entreat you by that &s;acred friend&s;hip which has &s;o long united us, to afford me an opportunity of pleading my pa&s;&s;ion. Her heart, which is &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of other impre&s;&s;ions, is, I fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in&s;en&s;ible to love. Procure me, however, the &s;atisfac|tion of certainty upon a point where the tortures of &s;u&s;pence are &s;urely the mo&s;t intolerable."</P>
<P>"Your penetration," replied Ferdinand, "has for once for&s;aken you, el&s;e you would now be &s;pared the tortures of which you complain, for you would have di&s;covered what I have long ob&s;erved, that Julia re|gards you with a partial eye."</P>
<P>"Do not," &s;aid Hippolitus, "make di&s;appoint|ment more terrible by flattery; neither &s;uffer the par|tiality of friend&s;hip to mi&s;lead your judgment. Your perceptions are affected by the warmth of your feel|ings, and becau&s;e you think I de&s;erve her di&s;tinction, you believe I po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Alas! you deceive your&s;elf, but not me!"</P>
<P>"The very rever&s;e," replied Ferdinand; "tis you who deceive your&s;elf, or rather it is the delicacy of the pa&s;&s;ion which animates you, and which will ever ope|rate again&s;t your clear perception of a truth in which your happine&s;s is &s;o deeply involved. Believe me, I &s;peak not without rea&s;on;&mdash;&s;he loves you."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words Hippolitus &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and cla&s;ping his hands in fervent joy, "Enchanting &s;ounds!" cried he, in a voice tenderly impa&s;&s;ioned; "<HI>could</HI> I but believe you!&mdash;could I <HI>but</HI> believe you&mdash; this world were paradi&s;e!"</P>
<P>During this exclamation, the emotions of Julia,
<PB N="60" REF="029381_0059_0FE0D28D58F0B078">
who &s;at in her clo&s;et adjoining, can with difficulty be imagined. A door which opened into it from the apartment where this conver&s;ation was held, was only half clo&s;ed. Agitated with the plea&s;ure this declara|tion excited, &s;he yet trembled with apprehen&s;ion le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be di&s;covered. She hardly dared to breathe, much le&s;s to move acro&s;s the clo&s;et to the door, which opened upon the gallery, whence &s;he might probably have e&s;caped unnoticed, le&s;t the &s;ound of her &s;tep &s;hould betray her. Compelled, therefore, to remain where &s;he was, &s;he &s;at in a &s;tate of fearful di&s;tre&s;s, which no colour of language can paint.</P>
<P>"Alas!" re&s;umed Hippolitus, "I too eagerly ad|mit the po&s;&s;ibility of what I wi&s;h. If you mean that I &s;hould really believe you, confirm your a&s;&s;ertion by &s;ome proof." "Readily," rejoined Ferdinand.</P>
<P>The heart of Julia beat quick.</P>
<P>"When you was &s;o &s;uddenly called to Naples upon the illne&s;s of the marquis Lomelli, I marked her con|duct well, and in that read the &s;entiments of her heart. On the following morning, I ob&s;erved in her counte|nance a re&s;tle&s;s anxiety which I had never &s;een before. She watched the entrance of every per&s;on with an ea|ger expectation, which was as often &s;ucceeded by evi|dent di&s;appointment. At dinner your departure was mentioned:&mdash;&s;he &s;pilt the wine &s;he was carrying to her lips, and for the remainder of the day was &s;pirit|le&s;s and melancholy. I &s;aw her ineffectual &s;truggles to conceal the oppre&s;&s;ion at her heart. Since that time &s;he has &s;eized every opportunity of withdrawing from company. The gaiety with which &s;he was &s;o lately charmed&mdash;charmed her no longer; &s;he became pen&s;ive, retired, and I have often heard her &s;inging in &s;ome lone &s;pot, the mo&s;t moving and tender airs. Your return produced a vi&s;ible and in&s;tantaneous alter|ation;
<PB N="61" REF="029381_0060_0FE0D2945DB28A00">
&s;he has now re&s;umed her gaiety; and the &s;oft confu&s;ion of her countenance, whenever you approach, might alone &s;uffice to convince you of the truth of my a&s;&s;ertion."</P>
<P>"O! talk for ever thus!" &s;ighed Hippolitus. "The&s;e words are &s;o &s;weet, &s;o &s;oothing to my &s;oul, that I could li&s;ten till I forgot I had a wi&s;h beyond them. Yes!&mdash;Ferdinand, the&s;e circum&s;tances are not to be doubted, and conviction opens upon my mind a flow of extacy I never knew till now. O! lead me to her, that I may &s;peak the &s;entiments which &s;well my heart."</P>
<P>They aro&s;e, when Julia, who with difficulty had &s;upported her&s;elf, now impelled by an irre&s;i&s;tible fear of in&s;tant di&s;covery, ro&s;e al&s;o, and moved &s;oftly to|wards the gallery. The &s;ound of her &s;tep alarmed the count, who, apprehen&s;ive le&s;t his conver&s;ation had been overheard, was anxious to be &s;atisfied whether any per&s;on was in the clo&s;et. He ru&s;hed in, and di&s;|covered Julia! She caught at a chair to &s;upport her trembling frame; and overwhelmed with mortifying &s;en&s;ations, &s;unk into it, and hid her face in her robe. Hippolitus threw him&s;elf at her feet, and &s;eizing her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips in expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence. Some moments pa&s;&s;ed before the confu&s;ion of either would &s;uffer them to &s;peak. At length recovering his voice, "Can you, Madam, &s;aid he, forgive this intru&s;ion, &s;o unintentional? or will it deprive me of that e&s;teem which I have but lately ventured to believe I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which I value more than exi&s;tence it&s;elf? O! &s;peak my pardon! Let me not believe that a &s;ingle accident has de&s;troyed my peace for ever."&mdash;"If your peace, Sir, depends upon a knowledge of my e&s;teem," &s;aid Julia, in a tremulous voice, "that peace is already &s;e|cure. If I wi&s;hed even to deny the partiality I feel, it

would now be u&s;ele&s;s; and &s;ince I no longer wi&s;h this, it would al&s;o be painful." Hippolitus could only weep his thanks over the hand he &s;till held. "Be &s;en&s;ible, however, of the delicacy of my &s;ituation," continued &s;he, ri&s;ing, "and &s;uffer me to withdraw." Saying this &s;he quitted the clo&s;et, leaving Hippolitus overcome with this &s;weet confirmation of his wi&s;hes, and Ferdinand not yet recovered from the painful &s;ur|pri&s;e which the di&s;covery of Julia had excited. He was deeply &s;en&s;ible of the confu&s;ion he had occa&s;ioned her, and knew that apologies would not re&s;tore the compo&s;ure he had &s;o cruelly yet unwarily di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Ferdinand awaited the hour appointed by the mar|quis in impatient curio&s;ity. The &s;olemn air which the marquis a&s;&s;umed when he commanded him to attend, had deeply impre&s;&s;ed his mind. As the time drew nigh, expectation increa&s;ed, and every moment &s;eemed to linger into hours. At length he repaired to the clo&s;et, where he did not remain long before the mar|quis entered&punc; The &s;ame chilling &s;olemnity marked his manner. He locked the door of the clo&s;et, and &s;eat|ing him&s;elf, addre&s;&s;ed Ferdinand as follows:</P>
<P>"I am now going to repo&s;e in you a confidence, which will &s;everely prove the &s;trength of your honour. But before I di&s;clo&s;e a &s;ecret, hitherto &s;o carefully con|cealed, and now reluctantly told, you mu&s;t &s;wear to pre&s;erve on this &s;ubject an eternal &s;ilence. If you doubt the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eadine&s;s of your di&s;cretion&mdash;now declare it, and &s;ave your&s;elf from the infamy, and the fatal con&s;equences, which may attend a breach of your oath;&mdash;if, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntrary, you believe your&s;elf capa|ble of a &s;trict integrity&mdash; now accept the terms, and receive the &s;ecret I offer." Ferdinand was awed by this exordium&mdash;the impatience of curio&s;ity was for a while &s;u&s;pended, and he he&s;itated whether he &s;hould
<PB N="63" REF="029381_0062_0FE0D29E8AA99188">
receive the &s;ecret upon &s;uch terms. At length he &s;ig|nified his con&s;ent, and the marquis ari&s;ing, drew his &s;word from the &s;cabbard.&mdash;"Here" &s;aid he, offering it to Ferdinand, "&s;eal your vows&mdash;&s;wear by this &s;acred pledge of honour never to repeat what I &s;hall now re|veal" Ferdinand bowed upon the &s;word, and rai&s;ing his eyes to Heaven &s;olemnly &s;wore. The marquis then re&s;umed his &s;eat, and proceeded.</P>
<P>"You are not to learn that, about a century ago, this ca&s;tle was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Vincent, third mar|quis of Mazzini, my grandfather. At that time there exi&s;ted an inveterate hatred between our family and that of della Campo. I &s;hall not now revert to the origin of the animo&s;ity, or relate the particulars of the con&s;equent feuds&mdash;&s;uffice it to ob&s;erve, that by the power of our family, the della Campos were unable to pre&s;erve their former con&s;equence in Sicily, and they have therefore quitted it for a foreign land to live in unmole&s;ted &s;ecurity. To return to my &s;ubject. &mdash;My grandfather, believing his life endangered by his enemy, planted &s;pies upon him. He employed &s;ome of the numerous banditti who &s;ought protection in his &s;ervice, and after &s;ome weeks pa&s;t in waiting for an opportunity, they &s;eized Henry della Campo, and brought him &s;ecretly to this ca&s;tle. He was for &s;ome time confined in a clo&s;e chamber of the &s;outhern build|ings, where he expired; by what means I &s;hall forbear to mention. The plan had been &s;o well conducted, and the &s;ecrecy &s;o &s;trictly pre&s;erved, that every endea|vour of his family to trace the means of his di&s;appear|ance, proved ineffectual. Their conjectures, it they fell upon our family, were &s;upported by no proof; and the della Campos are to this day ignorant of the mode of his death. A rumour had prevailed long be|fore the death of my father, that the &s;outhern build|ings

of the ca&s;tle were haunted. I di&s;believed the fact and treated it accordingly. One night when every human being of the ca&s;tle, except my&s;elf, was retire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to re&s;t, I had &s;uch &s;trong and dreadful proofs of the general a&s;&s;ertion, that even at this moment I can n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> recollect them without horror. Let me, if po&s;&s;ible forget them. From that moment I for&s;ook tho&s;e buildings; they have ever &s;ince been &s;hut up, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> circum&s;tance I have mentioned, is the true rea&s;on why I have re&s;ided &s;o little at the ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>Ferdinand li&s;tened to this narrative in &s;ilent horror. He remembered the temerity with which he had da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed to penetrate tho&s;e apartments&mdash;the light, and fi|gure he had &s;een&mdash;and, above all, his &s;ituation in the &s;tair ca&s;e of the tower. Every nerve thrilled at the re|collection; and the terrors of remembrance almo&s;t equalled tho&s;e of reality.</P>
<P>The marquis permitted his daughters to change their apartments, but he commanded Ferdinand to tell them, that in granting their reque&s;t, he con&s;ulted their ea&s;e only, and was him&s;elf by no means convinced of its propriety. They were accordingly re-in&s;tated in their former chambers, and the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+dame's apartments was re&s;erved for the marchione&s;s, who expre&s;&s;ed her di&s;content to the marquis in to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of mingled cen&s;ure and lamentation. The marquis privately reproved his daughters, for what he termed the idle fancies of a wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind; and de&s;ired them no more to di&s;turb the peace of the ca&s;tle with the &s;ubject of their late fears. They received this reproof with &s;ilent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&mdash;too much plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;uit to be &s;u&s;ceptible of any emotion but joy.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, reflecting on the late di&s;covery, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hocked to learn, what was now forced upon his belief that he was the de&s;cendant of a murderer. He no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

knew that innocent blood had been &s;hed in the ca&s;tle, and that the walls were &s;till the haunt of an unquiet &s;pirit, which &s;eemed to call aloud for retribution on the po&s;terity of him who had di&s;turbed its eternal re&s;t. Hippolitus perceived his dejection, and entreated that he might participate his unea&s;ine&s;s: but Ferdinand, who had hitherto been frank and ingenuous, was now inflexibly re&s;erved. "Forbear," &s;aid he "to urge a di&s;covery of what I am not permitted to reveal; this is the only point upon which I conjure you to be &s;i|lent, and this, even to you, I can not explain." Hip|politus was &s;urpri&s;ed, but pre&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject no farther.</P>
<P>Julia, though &s;he had been extremely mortified by the circum&s;tances attendant on the di&s;covery of her &s;entiments to Hippolitus, experienced, after the fir&s;t &s;hock had &s;ub&s;ided, an emotion more plea&s;ing than painful. The late conver&s;ation had painted in &s;trong colours the attachment of her lover. His diffidence&mdash; his &s;lowne&s;s to perceive the effect of his merit&mdash;his &s;ucceeding rapture, when conviction was at length forced upon his mind; and his conduct upon di&s;cover|ing Julia, proved to her at once the delicacy and the &s;trength of his pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he yielded her heart to &s;en&s;ations of pure and unmixed delight. She was rou&s;ed from this &s;tate of vi&s;ionary happine&s;s, by a &s;ummons from the marquis to attend him in the library. A circum&s;tance &s;o unu&s;ual &s;urpri&s;ed her, and &s;he obey|ed with trembling curio&s;ity. She found him pacing the room in deep thought, and &s;he had &s;hut the door before he perceived her. The authoritative &s;everity in his countenance alarmed her, and prepared her for a &s;ubject of importance. He &s;eated him&s;elf by her, and continued a moment &s;ilent. At length, &s;teadily ob|&s;erving her, "I &s;ent for you, my child," &s;aid he,
<PB N="66" REF="029381_0065_0FE0D2AE842399D0">
"to declare the honour which awaits you. The duke of Luovo has &s;olicited your hand. An alliance &s;o &s;plendid was beyond my expectation. You will re|ceive the di&s;tinction with the gratitude it claims, and prepare for the celebration of the nuptials."</P>
<P>This &s;peech fell like the dart of death upon the heart of Julia. She &s;at motionle&s;s&mdash;&s;tupified and de|prived of the power of utterance. The marquis ob|&s;erved her cou&s;ternation; and mi&s;taking its cau&s;e, "I acknowledge," &s;aid he, "that there is &s;omewhat ab|rupt in this affair; but the joy occa&s;ioned by a di&s;tinc|tion &s;o unmerited on your part, ought to overcome the little feminine weakne&s;s you might otherwi&s;e indulge. Retire and compo&s;e your&s;elf; and ob&s;erve," continu|ed he, in a &s;tern voice, "this is no time for fine&s;&s;e." The&s;e words rou&s;ed Julia from her &s;tate of horrid &s;tu|pefaction. "O! Sir," &s;aid &s;he, throwing her&s;elf at his feet, "forbear to enforce authority upon a point where to obey you would be wor&s;e than death; if, in|deed, to obey you were po&s;&s;ible." "Cea&s;e," &s;aid the marquis, "this affectation, and practi&s;e what becomes you." "Pardon me, my lord," &s;he replied, "my di&s;tre&s;s is, alas! unfeigned. I cannot love the duke." "Away," interrupted the marquis, "nor tempt my rage with objections thus childi&s;h and ab&s;urd." "Yet hear me, my lord," &s;aid Julia, tears &s;welling in her eyes, "and pity the &s;ufferings of a child, who never till this moment has dared to di&s;pute your commands."</P>
<P>"Nor &s;hall &s;he now," &s;aid the marquis. "What&mdash; when wealth, honour, and di&s;tinction are laid at my feet, &s;hall they be refu&s;ed, becau&s;e a fooli&s;h girl&mdash;a very baby, who knows not good from evil, cries, and &s;ays &s;he cannot love.

accept the duke, or quit this ca&s;tle for ever, and wan|der where you will." Saying this, he bur&s;t away, and Julia, who had hung weeping upon his knees, fell pro&s;trate upon the floor. The violence of the fall com|pleted the effect of her di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he fainted. In this &s;tate &s;he remained a con&s;iderable time. When &s;he recovered her &s;en&s;es, the recollection of her cala|mity bur&s;t upon her mind with a force that almo&s;t a|gain overwhelmed her. She at length rai&s;ed her&s;elf from the ground, and moved towards her own apart|ment, but had &s;carcely reached the great gallery, when Hippolitus entered it. Her trembling limbs would no longer &s;upport her;&mdash;&s;he caught at a banni&s;ter to &s;ave her&s;elf; and Hippolitus, with all his &s;peed, was &s;carcely in time to prevent her falling. The pale di&s;|tre&s;s exhibited in her counenance terrified him, and he anxiou&s;ly inquired concerning it. She could an&s;wer him only with her tears, which &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppre&s;s; and gently di&s;engaging her&s;elf, tottered to her clo&s;et. Hippolitus followed her to the door, but de&s;i&s;ted from further importunity. He pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips in tender &s;ilence, and withdrew &s;ur|pri&s;ed and alarmed.</P>
<P>Julia, re&s;igning her&s;elf to de&s;pair, indulged in &s;oli|tude the exce&s;s of her grief. A calamity, &s;o dreadful as the pre&s;ent, had never before pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her imagination. The union propo&s;ed would have been hateful to her, even if &s;he had no prior attachment; what then mu&s;t have been her di&s;tre&s;s, when &s;he had given her heart to him who de&s;erved all her admira|tion, and returned all her affection.</P>
<P>The duke de Luovo was of a character very &s;imilar to that of the marquis. The love of power was his ruling pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;with him no gentle or generous &s;en|timent meliorated the har&s;hne&s;s of authority, or di|rected
<PB N="68" REF="029381_0067_0FE0D2BA75CB7818">
it to acts of beneficence. He delighted in &s;im|ple undi&s;gui&s;ed tyranny. He had been twice married, and the unfortunate women &s;ubjected to his power, had fallen victims to the &s;low but corroding hand of &s;orrow. He had one &s;on, who &s;ome years before had e&s;caped the tyranny of his father, and had not been &s;ince heard of. At the late fe&s;tival the duke had &s;een Julia; and her beauty made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that he had been induced now to &s;olicit her hand. The marquis, delighted with the pro&s;pect of a connexion &s;o flattering to his favourlie pa&s;&s;ion, rea|dily granted his con&s;ent, and immediately &s;ealed it with a promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Julia remained for the re&s;t of the day &s;hut up in her clo&s;et, where the tender efforts of Madame and Emi|lia were exerted to &s;often her di&s;tre&s;s. Towards the clo&s;e of evening Ferdinand entered. Hippolitus, &s;hocked at her ab&s;ence, had reque&s;ted him to vi&s;it her, to alleviate her affliction, and if po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover its cau&s;e. Ferdinand, who tenderly loved his &s;i&s;ter, was alarmed by the words of Hippolitus, and immediately &s;ought her. Her eyes were &s;welled with weeping, and her countenance was but too expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;tate of her mind. Ferdinand's di&s;tre&s;s, when told of his father's conduct, was &s;carcely le&s;s than her own. He had plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the hope of uniting the &s;i&s;ter of his heart, with the friend whom he loved. An act of cruel authority now di&s;&s;olved the fairy dream of happine&s;s which his fancy had formed, and de&s;troyed the peace of tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to him. He &s;at for a long time &s;ilent and dejected; at length, &s;tarting from his melancholy reverie, he bade Julia good night, and returned to Hippolitus, who was waiting for him with anxious impatience in the north hall.</P>
<P>Ferdinand dreaded the effect of that de&s;pair, which
<PB N="69" REF="029381_0068_0FE0D2C01981F7E0">
the intelligence he had to communicate would produce in the mind of Hippolitus. He revolved &s;ome means of &s;oftening the dreadful truth; but Hippolitus, quick to apprehend the evil which love taught him to fear, &s;eized at once upon the reality. "Tell me all," &s;aid he, in a tone of a&s;&s;umed firmne&s;s. "I am prepared for the wor&s;t." Ferdinand related the decree of the marquis, and Hippolitus, &s;oon &s;unk into an exce&s;s of grief which defied, as much as it required, the powers of alleviation.</P>
<P>Julia, at length, retired to her chamber, but the &s;orrow which occupied her mind, with-held the ble&s;|&s;ings of &s;leep. Di&s;tracted and re&s;tle&s;s &s;he aro&s;e, and gently opened the window of her apartment. The night was &s;till, and not a breath di&s;turbed the &s;urface of the waters. The moon &s;hed a mild radiance over the waves, which in gentle undulations flowed upon the &s;ands. The &s;cene in&s;en&s;ibly tranquillized her &s;pi|rits. A tender and plea&s;ing melancholy diffu&s;ed it|&s;elf over her mind; and as &s;he mu&s;ed, &s;he heard the da&s;hing of di&s;tant oars. Pre&s;ently &s;he perceived upon the light &s;urface of the &s;ea a &s;mall boat. The &s;ound of the oars cea&s;ed, and a &s;olemn &s;train of harmony (&s;uch as fancy wafts from the abodes of the ble&s;&s;ed) &s;tole upon the &s;ilence of night. A chorus of voices now &s;welled upon the air, and died away at a di&s;tance. In the &s;train Julia recollected the midnight hymn to the virgin, and holy enthu&s;ia&s;m filled her heart. The chorus was repeated, accompanied by a &s;olemn &s;trik|ing of oars. A &s;igh of extacy &s;tole from her bo&s;om. Silence returned. The divine melody &s;he had heard calmed the tumult of her mind, and &s;he &s;unk in &s;weet repo&s;e.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e in the morning refre&s;hed by light &s;lum|bers; but the recollection of her &s;orrows &s;oon returned
<PB N="70" REF="029381_0069_0FE0D2C5E38E43B0">
with new force, and &s;ickening faintne&s;s overcame her. In this &s;ituation &s;he received a me&s;&s;age from the mar|quis to attend him in&s;tantly. She obeyed, and he bade her prepare to receive the duke, who that morn|ing purpo&s;ed to vi&s;it the ca&s;tle. He commanded her to attire her&s;elf richly, and to welcome him with &s;miles. Julia &s;ubmitted in &s;ilence. She &s;aw the mar|quis was inflexibly re&s;olved, and &s;he withdrew to in|dulge the angui&s;h of her heart, and prepare for this dete&s;ted interview.</P>
<P>The clock had &s;truck twelve, when a flouri&s;h of trumpets announced the approach of the duke. The heart of Julia &s;unk at the &s;ound, and &s;he threw her|&s;elf on a &s;opha overwhelmed with bitter &s;en&s;ations. Here &s;he was &s;oon di&s;turbed by a me&s;&s;age from the marquis. She aro&s;e, and tenderly embracing Emilia, their tears for &s;ome moments flowed together. At length &s;ummoning all her fortitude, &s;he de&s;cended to the hall, where, &s;he was met by the marquis. He led her to the &s;aloon in which the duke &s;at, with whom having conver&s;ed a &s;hort time, he withdrew. The emotion of Julia at this in&s;tant was beyond any thing &s;he had before &s;uffered; but by a &s;udden and &s;trange exertion of fortitude, which the force of de&s;perate ca|lamity &s;ometimes affords us, but which inferior &s;orrow toils after in vain, &s;he recovered her compo&s;ure, and re&s;umed her natural dignity. For a moment &s;he won|dered at her&s;elf, and &s;he formed the dangerous re&s;olu|tion of throwing her&s;elf upon the genero&s;ity of the duke, by acknowledging her reluctance to the engage|ment, and &s;oliciting him to withdraw his &s;uit.</P>
<P>The duke approached her with an air of proud con|de&s;cen&s;ion; and taking her hand placed him&s;elf be|&s;ide her. Having paid &s;ome formal and general com|pliments to her beauty, he proceeded to profe&s;s him|&s;elf
<PB N="71" REF="029381_0070_0FE0D2CDC1847550">
her admirer. She li&s;tened for &s;ome time to his profe&s;&s;ions, and when he appeared willing to hear her, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed him&mdash;"I am ju&s;tly &s;en&s;ible, my lord, of the di&s;tinction you offer me, and mu&s;t lament that re|&s;pectful gratitude is the only &s;entiment I can return. Nothing can more &s;trongly prove my confidence in your genero&s;ity, than when I confe&s;s to you, that parental authority urges me to give my hand, whither my heart can not accompany it."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed&mdash;the duke continued &s;ilent.&mdash;"'Tis you only, my lord, who can relea&s;e me from a &s;itua|tion &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; and to your goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice I appeal, certain that nece&s;&s;ity will excu&s;e the &s;ingularity of my conduct, and that I &s;hall not appeal in vain."</P>
<P>The duke was embarra&s;&s;ed&mdash;a flu&s;h of pride over|&s;pread his countenance, and he &s;eemed endeavouring to &s;tifle the feelings that &s;welled his heart. "I had been prepared Madam," &s;aid he, "to expect a very different reception, and had certainly no rea&s;on to be|lieve that the duke de Luovo was likely to &s;ue in vain. Since, however, Madam, you acknowledge that you have already di&s;po&s;ed of your affections, I &s;hall cer|tainly be very willing, if the marquis will relea&s;e me from our mutual engagements, to re&s;ign you to a more favoured lover." "Pardon me, my lord," &s;aid Julia, blu&s;hing, "&s;uffer me to"&mdash;"I am not ea&s;ily deceived, Madam," interrupted the duke,&mdash;"your conduct can be attributed only to the influence of a prior attachment; and though for &s;o young a lady, &s;uch a circum&s;tance is &s;omewhat extraordinary, I have certainly no right to arraign your choice. Permit me to wi&s;h you a good morning." He bowed low, and quitted the room. Julia now experienced a new di&s;|tre&s;s; &s;he dreaded the re&s;entment of the marquis, when he &s;hould be informed of her conver&s;ation with

terror, and pre&s;ently afterwards a low voice called her from without, and the door was opened by Ferdinand.</P>
<P>She &s;hrieked and fainted. On recovering, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;upported by Ferdinand and Hippolitus, who had &s;tolen this moment of &s;ilence and &s;ecurity to gain admittance to her pre&s;ence. Hippolitus came to urge a propo&s;al, which de&s;pair only could have &s;ugge&s;ted. "Fly," &s;aid he, "from the authority of a father who abu&s;es his power, and a&s;&s;ert the liberty of choice, which nature a&s;&s;igned you. Let the de&s;perate &s;itua|tion of my hopes plead excu&s;e for the apparent bold|ne&s;s of this addre&s;s, and let the man who exi&s;ts but for you, be the means of &s;aving you from de&s;truction. Alas! Madam, you are &s;ilent, and perhaps I have for|feited by this propo&s;al, the confidence I &s;o lately flat|tered my&s;elf I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. If &s;o, I will &s;ubmit to my fate in &s;ilence, and will to-morrow quit a &s;cene which pre&s;ents only images of di&s;tre&s;s to my mind.</P>
<P>Julia could &s;peak but with her tears. A variety of &s;trong and contending emotions &s;truggled at her brea&s;t, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the power of utterance. Ferdinand &s;e|con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the propo&s;al of the count. "It is unnece&s;&s;ary," my &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, "to point out the mi&s;ery which awaits you here. I love you too well tamely to &s;uffer you to be &s;acrificed to ambition, and to a pa&s;&s;ion &s;till more hateful. I now glory in calling Hippolitus my friend&mdash;let me ere long receive him as a brother. I can give no &s;tronger te&s;timony of my e&s;teem for his character, than in the wi&s;h I now expre&s;s. Believe me he has a heart worthy of your acceptance&mdash;a heart noble and expan&s;ive as your own." "Ah, cea&s;e," &s;aid Julia, "to dwell upon a character of who&s;e worth I am fully &s;en&s;ible. Your kindne&s;s and his merit can never be forgotten by her who&s;e misfortunes you have

&s;o generou&s;ly &s;uffered to intere&s;t you." She pau&s;ed in &s;ilent he&s;itation. A &s;en&s;e of delicacy made her he&s;i|tate upon the deci&s;ion which her heart &s;o warmly prompted. If &s;he fled with Hippolitus, &s;he would avoid one evil, and encounter another. She would e&s;cape the dreadful de&s;tiny awaiting her, but mu&s;t, perhaps, &s;ully the purity of that reputation, which was dearer to her than exi&s;tence. In a mind like her's, exqui&s;itely &s;u&s;ceptible of the pride of honour, this fear was able to counteract every other con&s;ideration and to keep her intentions in a &s;tate of painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e. She &s;ighed deeply, and continued &s;ilent. Hippolitus was alarmed by the calm di&s;tre&s;s which her counte|nance exhibited. "O! Julia," &s;aid he, "relieve me from this dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e!&mdash;&s;peak to me&mdash;explain this &s;ilence." She looked mournfully upon him&mdash;her lips moved, but no &s;ounds were uttered. As he re|peated his que&s;tion, &s;he waved her hand, and &s;unk back into her chair. She had not fainted, but conti|nued &s;ome time in a &s;tate of &s;tupor not le&s;s alarming. The importance of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, operating upon her mind, already harra&s;&s;ed by di&s;tre&s;s, had pro|duced a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of rea&s;on. Hippolitus hung over her in an agony not to be de&s;cribed, and Ferdinand vainly repeated her name. At length, ut|tering a deep &s;igh, &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf, and like one awakened from a dream, gazed around her. Hippol|itus thanked God fervently in his heart. "Tell me but that you are well," &s;aid he, "and that I may dare to hope, and we will leave you to repo&s;e." "My &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Ferdinand, "con&s;ult only your own wi&s;hes, and leave the re&s;t to me. Suffer a confidence in me to di&s;&s;ipate the doubts with which you are agi|tated." "Ferdinand," &s;aid Julia, emphatically,
<PB N="75" REF="029381_0074_0FE0D2E38B3FD260">
"how &s;hall I expre&s;s the gratitude your kindne&s;s has excited?" "Your gratitude," &s;aid he, "will be be&s;t &s;hown in con&s;ulting your own wi&s;hes; for be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever procures your happine&s;s, will mo&s;t ef|fectually e&s;tabli&s;h mine. Do not &s;uffer the prejudices of education to render you mi&s;erable. Believe that a choice which involves the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of your whole life, ought to be decided only by your&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Let us forbear for the pre&s;ent," &s;aid Hippolitus, "to urge the &s;ubject. Repo&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary for you," addre&s;&s;ing Julia, "and I will not &s;uffer a &s;elfi&s;h con|&s;ideration any longer to with-hold you from it.&mdash;Grant me but this reque&s;t&mdash;that at this hour to-morrow night, I may return hither to receive my doom." Julia hav|ing con&s;ented to receive Hippolitus and Ferdinand, they quitted the clo&s;et. In turning into the grand gallery, they were &s;urpri&s;ed by the appearance of a light, which gleamed upon the wall that terminated their view. It &s;eemed to proceed from a door which opened upon a back &s;tair-ca&s;e. They pu&s;hed on, but it almo&s;t in&s;tantly di&s;appeared, and upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e all was &s;till. They then &s;eparated, and retired to their apartments, &s;omewhat alarmed by this circum|&s;tance, which induced them to &s;u&s;pect that their vi&s;it to Julia had been ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Julia pa&s;&s;ed the night in broken &s;lumbers, and anx|ious con&s;ideration. On her pre&s;ent deci&s;ion, hung the cri&s;is of her fate. Her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the influ|ence of Hippolitus over her heart, made her fear to indulge its predilection, by tru&s;ting to her own opin|ion of its fidelity. She &s;hrunk from the di&s;graceful idea of an elopement, yet &s;he &s;aw no means of avoid|ing this, but by ru&s;hing upon the fate &s;o dreadful to her imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="029381_0075_0FE0D2E81DA31110">On the following night, when the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle were retired to re&s;t, Hippolitus, who&s;e ex|pectation had lengthened the hours into ages, accom|panied by Ferdinand, revi&s;ited the clo&s;et. Julia, who had known no interval of re&s;t &s;ince they left her, re|ceived them with much agitation. The vivid glow of health had fled her cheek, and was &s;ucceeded by a lan|guid delicacy, le&s;s beautiful, but more intere&s;ting. To the eager inquiries of Hippolitus, &s;he returned no an&s;wer, but faintly &s;miling through her tears, pre|&s;ented him her head, and covered her face with her robe. "I receive it," cried he, "as the pledge of my happine&s;s;&mdash;yet&mdash;yet let your voice ratify the gift." "If the pre&s;ent conce&s;&s;ion does not &s;ink me in your e&s;teem," &s;aid Julia, in a low tone, "this hand is your's." "The conce&s;&s;ion, my love (for by that tender name I may now call you) would, if po&s;|&s;ible, rai&s;e you in my e&s;teem; but &s;ince that has been long incapable of addition, it can only heighten my opinion of my&s;elf, and increa&s;e my gratitude to you: gratitude which I will endeavour to &s;how by an anxious care of your happine&s;s, and by the tender attentions of a whole life. From this ble&s;&s;ed moment," conti|nued he, in a voice of rapture, "permit, me, in thought, to hail you as my wife. From this moment, let me bani&s;h every ve&s;tige of &s;orrow&mdash;let me dry tho&s;e tears," gently pre&s;&s;ing her cheek with his lips, "ne|ver to &s;pring again."&mdash;The gratitude and joy which Ferdinand expre&s;&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, united with the tenderne&s;s of Hippolitus, to &s;oothe the agitated &s;pirits of Julia, and &s;he gradually recovered her com|placency.</P>
<P>They now arranged their plan of e&s;cape, in the ex|ecution of which no time was to be lo&s;t, &s;ince the nup|tials with the duke were to be &s;olemnized on the day
<PB N="77" REF="029381_0076_0FE0D2EEBA374648">
after the morrow. Their &s;cheme, whatever it was that &s;hould be adopted, they therefore re&s;olved to ex|ecute on the following night. But when they de|&s;cended from the fir&s;t warmth of enterprize, to minu|ter examination, they &s;oon found the difficulties of the undertaking. The keys of the ca&s;tle were kept by Robert, the confidential &s;ervant of the marquis, who every night depo&s;ited them in an iron che&s;t in his chamber. To obtain them by &s;tratagem &s;eemed im|po&s;&s;ible, and Ferdinand feared to tamper with the ho|ne&s;ty of this man, who had been many years in the &s;ervice of the marquis. Dangerous as was the attempt, no other alternative appeared, and they were therefore compelled to re&s;t all their hopes upon the experiment. It was &s;ettled, that if the keys could be procured, Fer|dinand and Hippolitus &s;hould meet Julia in the clo&s;et. That they &s;hould convey her to the &s;ea &s;hore, from whence a boat, which was to be kept in waiting, would carry them to the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Calabria, where the marriage might be &s;olemnized without dan|ger of interruption. But, as it was nece&s;&s;ary that Ferdinand &s;hould not appear in the affair, it was agreed that he &s;hould return to the ca&s;tle immediately upon the embarkation of his &s;i&s;ter. Having thus arranged this plan of operation, they &s;eparated till the following night, which was to decide the fate of Hippolitus and Julia.</P>
<P>Julia, who&s;e mind was &s;oothed by the fraternal kindne&s;s of Ferdinand, and the tender a&s;&s;urances of Hippolitus, now experienced an interval of repo&s;e. At the return of day &s;he awoke refre&s;hed, and tolerably compo&s;ed. She &s;elected the few clothes which were nece&s;&s;ary, and prepared them for her journey. A &s;en|timent of genero&s;ity ju&s;tified her in the re&s;erve &s;he pre|&s;erved to Emilia and Madame de Menon, who&s;e faith|fulne&s;s
<PB N="78" REF="029381_0077_0FE0D2F358443438">
and attachment &s;he could not doubt, but whom &s;he di&s;dained to involve in the di&s;grace that mu&s;t fall upon them, &s;hould their knowledge of her flight be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>In the mean time the ca&s;tle was a &s;cene of confu&s;ion. The magnificent preparations which were making for the nuptials, engaged all eyes, and bu&s;ied all hands. The marchione&s;s had the direction of the whole, and the alacrity with which &s;he acquitted her&s;elf, te&s;tified how much &s;he was plea&s;ed with the alliance, and cre|ated a &s;u&s;picion that it had not been concerted with|out &s;ome exertion of her influence. Thus was Julia de&s;igned the joint victim of ambition, and illicit love.</P>
<P>The compo&s;ure of Julia declined with the day, who&s;e hours had crept heavily along. As the night drew on, her anxiety for the &s;ucce&s;s of Ferdinand's ne|gociation with Robert, increa&s;ed to a painful degree. A variety of new emotions pre&s;&s;ed at her heart, and &s;ubdued her &s;pirits. When &s;he bade Emilia good night, &s;he thought &s;he beheld her for the la&s;t time. The ideas of the di&s;tance which would &s;eparate them, of the dangers &s;he was going to encounter, with a train of wild and fearful anticipations, crowded upon her mind, tears &s;prang in her eyes, and it was with diffi|culty &s;he avoided betraying her emotions. Of Ma|dame too, her heart took a tender farewell. At length &s;he heard the marquis retire to his apartment, and the doors belonging to the &s;everal chambers of the gue&s;ts &s;ucce&s;&s;ively clo&s;e. She marked with trembling attention the gradual change from bu&s;tle to quiet, till all was &s;till.</P>
<P>She now held her&s;elf in readine&s;s to depart, at the moment in which Ferdinand and Hippolitus, for who&s;e &s;teps in the gallery &s;he eagerly li&s;tened, &s;hould appear. The ca&s;tle clock &s;truck twelve. The &s;ound &s;eemed to

&s;hake the pile. Julia felt it thrill upon her heart. "I hear you," &s;ighed &s;he "for the la&s;t time." The &s;till|ne&s;s of death &s;ucceeded. She continued to li&s;ten, but no &s;ound met her ear. For a con&s;iderable time &s;he &s;at in a &s;tate of anxious expectation not to be de&s;crib|ed. The clock chimed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive quarters, and her fear ro&s;e to each additional &s;ound. At length &s;he heard it &s;trike one. Hollow was that &s;ound, and dreadful to her hopes, for neither Hippolitus nor Fer|dinand appeared. She grew faint with fear and di&s;|appointment. Her mind, which for two hours had been kept upon the &s;tretch of expectation, now re&s;ign|ed it&s;elf to de&s;pair. She gently opened the door of her clo&s;et, and looked upon the gallery, but all was lonely and &s;ilent. It appeared that Robert had re|fu&s;ed to be acce&s;&s;ary to their &s;cheme, and it was pro|bable that he had betrayed it to the marquis. Over|whelmed with bitter reflexions, &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the &s;opha in the fir&s;t di&s;traction of de&s;pair. Suddenly &s;he thought &s;he heard a noi&s;e in the gallery; and as &s;he &s;tarted from her po&s;ture to li&s;ten to the &s;ound, the door of her clo&s;et was gently opened by Ferdinand. "Come, my love," &s;aid he, the keys are ours, and we have not a moment to lo&s;e; our delay has been un|avoidable, but this is no time for explanation." Julia, almo&s;t fainting gave her hand to Ferdinand; and Hippolitus, after &s;ome &s;hort expre&s;&s;ion of his thankful|ne&s;s, followed. They pa&s;&s;ed the door of Madame's chamber; and treading the gallery with &s;low and &s;i|lent &s;teps, de&s;cended to the hall. This they cro&s;&s;ed towards a door, after opening which they were to find their way through various pa&s;&s;ages to a remote part of the ca&s;tle, where a private door opened upon the walls. Ferdinand carried the &s;everal keys. They fa&s;tened the hall door after them, and proceeded through a narrow pa&s;&s;age terminating in a &s;tair ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="029381_0079_0FE0D2FEA93FB528">They de&s;cended, and had hardly reached the bot|tom, when they heard a loud noi&s;e at the door above, and pre&s;ently the voices of &s;everal people. Julia &s;carce|ly felt the ground &s;he trod on, and Ferdinand flew to unlock a door that ob&s;tructed their way. He applied the different keys, and at length found the proper one, but the lock was ru&s;ted and refu&s;ed to yield. Their di&s;tre&s;s now was not to be conceived. The noi&s;e a|bove increa&s;ed, and it &s;eemed as if the people were forcing the door. Hippolitus and Ferdinand vainly tri|ed to turn the key. A &s;udden cra&s;h from above con|vinced them that the door had yielded, when making another de&s;perate effort, the key broke in the lock. Trembling and exhau&s;ted, Julia gave her&s;elf up for lo&s;t. As &s;he hung upon Ferdinand, Hippolitus vainly endeavoured to &s;oothe her&mdash;the noi&s;e &s;uddenly cea&s;ed. They li&s;tened, dreading to hear the &s;ounds renewed; but, to their utter a&s;toni&s;hment, the &s;ilence of the place remained undi&s;turbed. They had now time to breathe, and to con&s;ider the po&s;&s;ibility of effecting their e&s;cape, for from the marquis they had no mercy to hope. Hippolitus, in order to a&s;certain whether the people had quitted the door above, began to a&s;cend the pa&s;|&s;age, in which he had not gone many &s;teps, when the noi&s;e was renewed with increa&s;ed violence. He in|&s;tantly retreated; and making a de&s;perate pu&s;h at the door below, which ob&s;tructed their pa&s;&s;age, it &s;eemed to yield, and by another effort of Ferdinand, bur&s;t open. They had not an in&s;tant to lo&s;e, for they now heard the &s;teps of per&s;ons de&s;cending the &s;tairs. The avenue they were in opened into a kind of chamber, whence three pa&s;&s;ages branched, of which they imme|diately cho&s;e the fir&s;t. Another door now ob&s;tructed their pa&s;&s;age, and they were compelled to wait while Ferdinand applied the keys. "Be quick," &s;aid Julia,
<PB N="81" REF="029381_0080_0FE0D30261033BA0">
"or we are lo&s;t. O! if this lock too is ru&s;ted!"&mdash; "Hark! &s;aid Ferdinand." They now di&s;covered what apprehen&s;ion had before prevented them from perceiving, that the &s;ounds of pur&s;uit were cea&s;ed, and all again was &s;ilent. As this could happen only by the mi&s;take of their pur&s;uers, in taking the wrong <HI>route,</HI> they re&s;olved to pre&s;erve their advantage, by concealing the light which Ferdinand now covered with his cloak. The door was opened, and they pa&s;&s;|ed on, but they were perplexed in the intricacies of the place, and wandered about, in vain endeavours to find their way. Often did they pau&s;e to li&s;ten, and often did fancy give them &s;ounds of fearful import. At length they entered on the pa&s;&s;age, which Ferdi|nand knew led directly to a door that opened on the woods. Rejoiced at this certainty, they &s;oon reached the &s;pot which was to give them liberty.</P>
<P>Ferdinand turned the key, the door unclo&s;ed, and to their infinite joy di&s;covered to them the grey dawn.</P>
<P>"Now, my love," &s;aid Hippolitus, "you are &s;afe, and I am happy."&mdash;Immediately a loud voice from without exclaimed, "Take, villain, the reward of your perfidy!" at the &s;ame in&s;tant Hippolitus receiv|ed a &s;word in his body, and uttering a deep &s;igh, fell to the ground. Julia &s;hrieked, and fainted. Ferdinand, drawing his &s;word, advanced towards the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, upon who&s;e countenance the light of his lamp then &s;hone, and di&s;covered to him his father! The &s;word fell from his gra&s;p, and he &s;tarted back in an agony of horror. He was in&s;tantly &s;urrounded, and &s;eized by the &s;ervants of the marquis, while the marquis him&s;elf denounced vengeance upon his head, and ordered him to be thrown into a dungeon of the ca&s;tle. At this in|&s;tant the &s;ervants of the count, who were awaiting his arrival on the &s;ea &s;hore, hearing the tumult, ha&s;tened to
<PB N="82" REF="029381_0081_0FE0D308CE9229E0">
the &s;cene, and there beheld their beloved ma&s;ter, life|le&s;s and weltering in his blood. They conveyed the bleeding body, with loud lamentations, on board the ve&s;&s;el which had been prepared for him, and immedi|ately &s;et &s;ail for Italy.</P>
<P>Julia, on recovering her &s;en&s;es, found her&s;elf in a &s;mall room, of which &s;he had no remembrance, with her maid weeping over her. Recollection, when it returned, brought to her mind an energy of grief, which exceeded even all former conceptions of &s;uffer|ing. Yet her mi&s;ery was heightened by the intelli|gence which &s;he now received. She learned that Hippolitus had been borne away lifele&s;s by his people, that Ferdinand was confined in a dungeon by order of the marquis, and that her&s;elf was a pri&s;oner in a remote room, from which, on the day after the morrow, &s;he was to be removed to the chapel of the ca&s;tle, and there &s;acrificed to the ambition of her father, and the ab&s;urd love of the duke de Luovo.</P>
<P>This accumulation of evil &s;ubdued each power of re&s;i&s;tance, and reduced Julia to a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction. No per&s;on was allowed to approach her but her maid, and the &s;ervant who brought her food. Emilia, who, though &s;hocked by Julia's apparant want of confidence, &s;everely &s;ympathized in her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o|licited to &s;ee her; but the pain of denial was &s;o &s;harp|ly aggravated by rebuke, that &s;he dared not again to urge the reque&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time Ferdinand, involved in the gloom of a dungeon, was re&s;igned to the painful recollection of the pa&s;t, and a horrid anticipation of the future. From the re&s;entment of the marquis, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were wild and terrible, and who&s;e rank gave him an unlimited power of life and death in his own territo|ries, Ferdinand had much to fear. Yet &s;elfi&s;h appre|hen&s;ion
<PB N="83" REF="029381_0082_0FE0D30E64145018">
&s;oon yielded to a more noble &s;orrow. He mourned the fate of Hippolitus, and the &s;ufferings of Julia. He could attribute the failure of their &s;cheme only to the treachery of Robert, who had, however, met the wi&s;hes of Ferdinand, with &s;trong apparent &s;inceri|ty, and generous intere&s;t in the cau&s;e of Julia. On the night of the intended elopement he had con&s;igned the keys to Ferdinand, who, immediately on receiving them, went to the apartment of Hippolitus. There they were detained till after the clock had &s;truck one, by a low noi&s;e, which returned at intervals, and con|vinced them, that &s;ome part of the family was not yet retired to re&s;t. This noi&s;e was undoubtedly occa&s;ion|ed by the people whom the marquis had employed to watch, and who&s;e vigilance was too faithful to &s;uffer the fugitives to e&s;cape. The very caution of Ferdi|nand defeated its purpo&s;e; for it is probable, that had he attempted to quit the ca&s;tle by the common en|trance, he might have e&s;caped. The keys of the grand door, and tho&s;e of the courts, remaining in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Robert, the marquis was certain of the intend|ed place of their departure; and was thus enabled to defeat their hopes at the very moment when they ex|ulted in their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>When the marchione&s;s learned the fate of Hippoli|tus, the re&s;entment of jealous pa&s;&s;ion, yielded to emo|tions of pity. Revenge was &s;atisfied, and &s;he could now lament the &s;ufferings of a youth, who&s;e per&s;onal charms had touched her heart as much as his virtues had di&s;appointed her hopes. Still true to pa&s;&s;ion, and inacce&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on, &s;he poured upon the defencele&s;s Julia her anger for that calamity of which &s;he her&s;elf was the unwilling cau&s;e. By a dexterous adaptation of her powers, &s;he had worked upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the marquis, &s;o as to render him relentle&s;s in the pur|&s;uit
<PB N="84" REF="029381_0083_0FE0D313D7842C10">
of his ambitious purpo&s;es, and in&s;atiable in reveng|ing his di&s;appointment. But the effects of her arti|fices exceeded her intention in exerting them; and when &s;he meant only to &s;acrifice a rival to her love, &s;he found &s;he had given up its object to revenge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE nuptial morn, &s;o ju&s;tly dreaded by Julia, and &s;o impatiently awaited by the marquis, now arrived. The marriage was to be celebrated with a magnificence which demon&s;trated the joy it occa&s;ioned to the mar|quis. The ca&s;tle was fitted up in a &s;tyle of grandeur &s;uperior to any thing that had been before &s;een in it. The neighbouring nobility were invited to an entertainment which was to conclude with a &s;plendid ball and &s;upper, and the gates were to be thrown open to all who cho&s;e to partake of the bounty of the mar|quis. At an early hour the duke, attended by a nu|merous retinue, entered the ca&s;tle. Ferdinand heard from his dungeon, where the rigour and the policy of of the marquis &s;till confined him, the loud clattering of hoofs in the court yard above, the rolling of the car|riage wheels, and all the tumultuous bu&s;tle which the entrance of the duke occa&s;ioned. He too well under|&s;tood this cau&s;e of the uproar, and it awakened in him &s;en&s;ations re&s;embling tho&s;e which the condemned criminal feels, when his ears are a&s;&s;ailed by the dread|ful &s;ound that precede his execution. When he was able to think of him&s;elf, he wondered by what means the marquis would reconcile his ab&s;ence to the gue&s;ts&punc; He however, knew too well the di&s;&s;ipated character of the Sicilian nobility, to doubt, that whatever &s;tory
<PB N="85" REF="029381_0084_0FE0D3170B492518">
&s;hould be invented would be very readily believed by them; who, even if they knew the truth, would not &s;uffer a di&s;covery of their knowledge to interrupt the fe&s;tivity which was offered them.</P>
<P>The marquis and marchione&s;s received the duke in the outer hall, and conducted him to the &s;aloon, where he partook of the refre&s;hments prepared for him, and from hence retired to the chapel. The marquis now withdrew to lead Julia to the altar, and Emilia was ordered to attend at the door of the chapel, in which the prie&s;t and a numerous company were already a&s;|&s;embled. The marchione&s;s, a prey to the turbulence of &s;ucceeding pa&s;&s;ions, exulted in the near completion of her favourite &s;cheme. A di&s;appointment, however was prepared for her, which would at once cru&s;h the triumph of her malice and her pride. The marquis, on entering the pri&s;on of Julia, found it empty! His a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation, upon the di&s;covery, al|mo&s;t overpowered his rea&s;on. Of the &s;ervants of the ca&s;tle, who were immediately &s;ummoned, he inquired concerning her e&s;cape, with a mixture of fury and &s;or|row, which left them no opportunity for reply. They had, however, no information to give, but that her woman had not appeared during the whole morning. In the pri&s;on were found the bridal habiliments which the marchione&s;s her&s;elf had &s;ent on the preceding night, together with a letter addre&s;&s;ed to Emilia, which con|tained the following words:</P>
<P>"Adieu, dear Emilia; never more will you &s;ee your wretched &s;i&s;ter, who flies from the cruel fate now prepared for her, certain that &s;he can never meet one more dreadful.&mdash;In happine&s;s or mi&s;ery&mdash;in hope or in de&s;pair&mdash;whatever may be your &s;ituation&mdash;&s;till re|member me with pity and affection. Dear Emilia,
<PB N="86" REF="029381_0085_0FE0D31C75DBF2D8">
adieu!&mdash;You will always be the &s;i&s;ter of my heart&mdash; may you never be the partner of my misfortunes!"</P>
<P>While the marquis was reading this letter, the mar|chione&s;s, who &s;uppo&s;ed the delay occa&s;ioned by &s;ome oppo&s;ition from Julia, flew to the apartment. By her orders all the habitable parts of the ca&s;tle were ex|plored, and &s;he her&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;earch. At length the intelligence was communicated to the chapel, and the confu&s;ion became univer&s;al. The prie&s;t quitted the altar, and the company returned to the &s;aloon.</P>
<P>The letter, when it was given to Emilia, excited emotions which &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;gui&s;e, but which did not, however, protect her from a &s;u&s;picion that &s;he was concerned in the tran&s;action, her know|ledge of which this letter appeared intended to conceal.</P>
<P>The marquis immediately di&s;patched &s;ervants upon the fleete&s;t hor&s;es of his &s;tables, with directions to take different routes, and to &s;cour every corner of the i&s;land in pur&s;uit of the fugitives. When the&s;e exertions had &s;omewhat quieted his mind, he began to con&s;ider by what means Julia could have effected her e&s;cape. She had been confined in a &s;mall room in a remote part of the ca&s;tle, to which no per&s;on had been admitted but her own woman, and Robert, the confidential &s;ervant of the marquis. Even Li&s;ette had not been &s;uffered to enter, unle&s;s accompanied by Robert, in who&s;e room, &s;ince the night of the fatal di&s;covery, the keys had been regularly depo&s;ited. Without them it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he could have e&s;caped: the windows of the aparment being barred and grated, and opening into an inner court, at a prodigious height from the ground. Be&s;ides who could &s;he depend upon for protection&mdash;or whither could &s;he intend to fly for concealment?&mdash;The a&s;&s;ociates of her former elopement were utterly unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t her even with advice. Ferdinand, him&s;elf a
<PB N="87" REF="029381_0086_0FE0D3228A660490">
pri&s;oner, had been deprived of any means of intercour&s;e with her, and Hippolitus had been carried lifele&s;s on board a ve&s;&s;el which had immediately &s;ailed for Italy.</P>
<P>Robert, to whom the key had been intru&s;ted, was &s;everely interrogated by the marquis. He per&s;i&s;ted in a &s;imple and uniform declaration of his innocence; but as the marquis believed it impo&s;&s;ible that Julia could have e&s;caped without his knowledge, he was or|dered into impri&s;onment till he &s;hould confe&s;s the fact.</P>
<P>The pride of the duke was &s;everely wounded by this elopement, which proved the exce&s;s of Julia's aver&s;ion, and compleated the di&s;graceful circum&s;tances of his rejection. The marquis had carefully concealed from him her prior attempt at elopement, and her con|&s;equent confinement; but the truth now bur&s;t from di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;tood revealed with bitter aggravation. The duke, fired with indignation at the duplicity of the marquis, poured forth his re&s;entment in terms of proud and bitter invective; and the marquis, galled by recent di&s;appointment, was in no mood to re&s;train the impetuo&s;ity of his nature. He retorted with acri|mony; and the con&s;equence would have been &s;erious, had not the friends of each party interpo&s;ed for their pre&s;ervation. The di&s;putants were at length reconci|led; it was agreed to pur&s;ue Julia with united, and indefatigable &s;earch; and that whenever &s;he &s;hould be found, the nuptials &s;hould be &s;olemnized without fur|ther delay. With the character of the duke, this conduct was con&s;i&s;tent. His pa&s;&s;ions, inflamed by di&s;|appointment, and &s;trengthened by repul&s;e, now defied the power of ob&s;tacle; and tho&s;e con&s;iderations which would have operated with a more delicate mind to overcome its original inclination, &s;erved only to en|crea&s;e the violence of his.</P>
<P>Madame de Menon, who loved Julia with maternal
<PB N="88" REF="029381_0087_0FE0D32724A495B0">
affection, was an intere&s;ted ob&s;erver of all that pa&s;&s;ed at the ca&s;tle. The cruel fate to which the marquis de&s;|tined his daughter, &s;he had &s;everely lamented, yet &s;he could hardly rejoice to find that this had been avoided by elopement. She trembled for the future &s;afety of her pupil; and her tranquillity, which was thus fir&s;t di&s;turbed for the welfare of others, &s;he was not &s;oon &s;uffered to recover.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s had long nouri&s;hed a &s;ecret di&s;like to Madame de Menon, who&s;e virtues were a &s;ilent re|proof to her vices. The contrariety of their di&s;po&s;i|tions, created in the marchione&s;s an aver&s;ion which would have amounted to contempt, had not that dig|nity of virtue which &s;trongly characterized the manners of Madame, compelled the former to fear what &s;he wi&s;hed to de&s;pi&s;e. Her con&s;cience whi&s;pered her that the di&s;like was mutual; and &s;he now rejoiced in the opportunity which &s;eemed to offer it&s;elf, of lowering the proud integrity of Madame's character. Pretend|ing, therefore, to believe that &s;he had encouraged Fer|dinand to di&s;obey his father's commands, and had been acce&s;&s;ary to the elopement, &s;he accu&s;ed her of the&s;e offences, and &s;timulated the marquis to reprehend her conduct. But the integrity of madame de Menon was not to be que&s;tioned with impunity. Without deign|ing to an&s;wer the imputation, &s;he de&s;ired to re&s;ign an office of which &s;he was no longer con&s;idered worthy, and to quit the ca&s;tle immediately. This the policy of the marquis would not &s;uffer; and he was compelled to make &s;uch ample conce&s;&s;ions to Madame, as in|duced her for the pre&s;ent to continue at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The news of Julia's elopement at length reached the ears of Ferdinand, who&s;e joy at this event was equalled only by his &s;urpri&s;e. He lo&s;t, for a moment, the &s;en&s;e of his own &s;ituation, and thought only of the
<PB N="89" REF="029381_0088_0FE0D144F8C59990">
e&s;cape of Julia. But his &s;orrow &s;oon returned with ac|cumulated force when he recollected that Julia might then perhaps want that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which his confine|ment alone could prevent his affording her.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants, who had been &s;ent in pur&s;uit, returned to the ca&s;tle without any &s;atisfactory information. Week after week elap&s;ed in fruitle&s;s &s;earch, yet the duke was &s;trenuous in continuing the pur&s;uit. Emi&s;|&s;aries were di&s;patched to Naples, and to the &s;everal e&s;tates of the count Vereza, but they returned with|out any &s;atisfactory information. The count had not been heard of &s;ince he quitted Naples for Sicily.</P>
<P>During the&s;e inquiries a new &s;ubject of di&s;turbance broke out in the ca&s;tle of Mazzina. On the night &s;o fatal to the hopes of Hippolitus and Julia, when the tumult was &s;ub&s;ided, and all was &s;till, a light was ob|&s;erved by a &s;ervant as he pa&s;&s;ed by the window of the great &s;tair ca&s;e in the way to his chamber, to glimmer through the ca&s;ement before noticed in the &s;outhern buildings. While he &s;tood ob&s;erving it, it vani&s;hed, and pre&s;ently re-appeared. The former my&s;terious circum&s;tances relative to the&s;e buildings ru&s;hed upon his mind; and fired with wonder, he rou&s;ed &s;ome of his fellow &s;ervants to come and behold this phenomenon.</P>
<P>As they gazed in &s;ilent terror, the light di&s;appear|ed, and &s;oon after, they &s;aw a &s;mall door belonging to the &s;outh tower open, and a figure bearing a light i&s;&s;ue forth, which gliding along the ca&s;tle walls, was quickly lo&s;t to their view. Overcome with fear, they hurried back to their chambers, and revolved all the late wonderful occurrences. They doubted not, that this was the figure formerly &s;een by the lady Julia. The &s;udden change of Madame de Menon's apartments had not pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved by the &s;ervants, but they now longer he&s;itated to what to attribute the remo|val.
<PB N="90" REF="029381_0089_0FE0D33250C32728">
They collected each various and uncommon cir|cum&s;tance attendant on this part of the fabric; and, comparing them with the pre&s;ent, their &s;uper&s;titious fears were confirmed, and their terror heightened to &s;uch a degree, that many of them re&s;olved to quit the &s;ervice of the marquis.</P>
<P>The marquis &s;urpri&s;ed at this &s;udden de&s;ertion, in|quired into its cau&s;e, and learned the truth. Shocked by this di&s;covery, he yet re&s;olved to prevent, if po&s;|&s;ible the ill effects which might be expected from a circulation of the report. To this end it was nece&s;|&s;ary to quiet the minds of his people, and to prevent their quitting his &s;ervice. Having &s;everely reprehended them for the idle apprehen&s;ion they encouraged, he told them that, to prove the fallacy of their &s;urmi&s;es, he would lead them over that part of the ca&s;tle which was the &s;ubject of their fears, and ordered them to at|tend him at the return of night in the north hall. Emi|lia and Madame de Menon &s;urpri&s;ed at this procedure, awaited the i&s;&s;ue in &s;ilent expectation.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants in obedience to the commands of the marquis a&s;&s;embled at night in the north hall. The air of de&s;olation which reigned through the &s;outh buildings; and the circum&s;tance of their having been for &s;o many years &s;hut up, would naturally tend to in|&s;pire awe; but to the&s;e people, who firmly believed them to be the haunt of an unquiet &s;pirit, terror was the predominant &s;entiment.</P>
<P>The marquis now appeared with the keys of the&s;e buildings in his hands, and every heart thrilled with wild expectation. He ordered Robert to precede him with a torch, and the re&s;t of the &s;ervants following, he pa&s;&s;ed on. A pair of iron gates were unlocked, and they proceeded through a court, who&s;e pavement was wildly overgrown with long gra&s;s, to the great
<PB N="91" REF="029381_0090_0FE0D33725B964F8">
door of the &s;outh fabric. Here they met with &s;ome difficulty, for the lock, which had not been turned for many years, was ru&s;ted.</P>
<P>During this interval, the &s;ilence of expectation &s;ealed the lips of all pre&s;ent. At length the lock yielded. That door which had not been pa&s;&s;ed for &s;o many years, creaked heavily upon its hinges, and di&s;clo&s;ed the hall of black marble which Ferdinand had formerly cro&s;&s;ed. "Now," cried the marquis, in a tone of irony as he entered, "expect to encounter the gho&s;ts of which you tell me; but if you fail to conquer them, prepare to quit my &s;ervice. The people who live with me, &s;hall at lea&s;t have courage and ability &s;ufficient to de|fend me from the&s;e &s;piritual attacks. All I apprehend is, that the enemy will not appear, and in this ca&s;e your valour will go untried."</P>
<P>No one dared to an&s;wer, but all followed, in &s;ilent fear, the marquis, who a&s;cended the great &s;tair-ca&s;e, and entered the gallery. "Unlock that door," &s;aid he, pointing to one on the left, "and we will &s;oon unhou&s;e the&s;e gho&s;ts." Robert applied the key, but his hand &s;hook &s;o violently that he could not turn it. "Here is a fellow," cried the marquis, "&s;it to encounter a whole legion of &s;pirits. Do you, An|thony, take the key, and try your valour."</P>
<P>"Plea&s;e you, my lord," replied Anthony, "I ne|ver was a good one at unlocking a door in my life, but here is Gregory will do it." "No, my lord, an' plea&s;e you," &s;aid Gregory, here is Richard." "Stand off," &s;aid the marquis, "I will &s;hame your cowardice, and do it my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Saying this he turned the key, and was ru&s;hing on, but the door refu&s;ed to yield; it &s;hook under his hands, and &s;eemed as if partially held by &s;ome per&s;on on the other &s;ide. The marquis was &s;urpri&s;ed, and
<PB N="92" REF="029381_0091_0FE0D33BC663B630">
made &s;everal efforts to move it, without effect. He then ordered his &s;ervants to bur&s;t it open, but, &s;hrink|ing back with one accord, they cried "for God's &s;ake, my lord, go no farther; we are &s;atisfied here are no gho&s;ts, only let us go back."</P>
<P>"It is now then my turn to be &s;atisfied," replied the marquis, and till I am, not one of you &s;hall &s;tir. Open me that door." "My lord!"&mdash;"Nay," &s;aid the marquis, a&s;&s;uming a look of &s;tern authority&mdash;"di&s;|pute not my commands, I am not to be trifled with."</P>
<P>They now &s;tepped forward, and applied their &s;trength to the door, when a loud and &s;udden noi&s;e bur&s;t from within, and re&s;ounded through the hollow chambers! The men &s;tarted back in a fright, and were ru&s;hing headlong down the &s;tair-ca&s;e, when the voice of the marquis arre&s;ted their flight. They returned with hearts palpitating with terror, "Ob&s;erve what I &s;ay," &s;aid the marquis, "and behave like men. Yonder door," pointing to one at &s;ome di&s;tance, "will lead us through other rooms to this chamber&mdash;unlock it therefore, for I will know the cau&s;e of the&s;e &s;ounds." Shocked at this determination, the &s;ervants again &s;up|plicated the marquis to go no farther; and to be obeyed, he was obliged to exert all his authority. The door was opened, and di&s;covered a long narrow pa&s;|&s;age, into which they de&s;cended by a few &s;teps. It led to a gallery that terminated in a back &s;tair-ca&s;e, where &s;everal doors appeared, one of which the mar|quis unclo&s;ed. A &s;pacious chamber appeared beyond, who&s;e walls decayed and di&s;coloured by the damps, exhibited a melancholy proof of de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed on through a long &s;uite of lofty and noble apartments&punc; which were in the &s;ame ruinous con|dition. At length they came to the chamber whence the noi&s;e had i&s;&s;ued. "Go fir&s;t Robert, with the
<PB N="93" REF="029381_0092_0FE0D342A81707F0">
light," &s;aid the marquis, as they approached the door, "this is the key." Robert trembled&mdash;but obeyed, and the other &s;ervants followed in &s;ilence. They &s;top|ped a moment at the door to li&s;ten, but all was &s;till within. The door was opened, and di&s;clo&s;ed a large vaulted chamber, nearly re&s;embling tho&s;e they had pa&s;&s;ed, and on looking round, they di&s;covered at once the cau&s;e of the alarm.&mdash;A part of the decayed roof was fallen in, and the &s;tones and rubbi&s;h of the ruin falling again&s;t the gallery door, ob&s;tructed the pa&s;&s;age. It was evident, too, whence the noi&s;e which occa&s;ioned their terror had ari&s;en; the loo&s;e &s;tones which were piled again&s;t the door being &s;hook by the effort made to open it, had given way, and rolled to the floor.</P>
<P>After &s;urveying the place, they returned to the back &s;tairs, which they de&s;cended, and having pur&s;ued the &s;everal windings of a long pa&s;&s;age, found them&s;elves again in the marble hall. "Now," &s;aid the marquis, "what think ye?&mdash;What evil &s;pirits infe&s;t the&s;e walls? Henceforth be cautious how ye credit the phanta&s;ms of idlene&s;s, for ye may not always meet with a ma&s;ter who will conde&s;cend to undeceive ye." They acknow|ledged the goodne&s;s of the marquis, and profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves perfectly con&s;cious of the error of their former &s;u&s;picions, de&s;ire they might &s;earch no farther. "I choo&s;e to leave nothing to your imagination," re|plied the marquis, le&s;t hereafter it &s;hould betray you into a &s;imilar error. Follow me, therefore; you &s;hall &s;ee the whole of the&s;e buildings." Saying this he led them to the &s;outh tower. They remembered, that from a door of this tower, the figure which cau&s;ed their alarm had i&s;&s;ued; and notwith&s;tanding the late a&s;&s;ertion of their &s;u&s;picions being removed, fear &s;till operated powerfully upon their minds, and they would willingly have been excu&s;ed from farther re&s;earch.
<PB N="94" REF="029381_0093_0FE0D34868B04668">
"Would any of you choo&s;e to explore this tower?" &s;aid the marquis, pointing to the broken &s;tair-ca&s;e; "for my&s;elf I am mortal, and therefore fear to venture, but you who hold communion with di&s;embodied &s;pirits, may partake &s;omething of their nature, if &s;o, you may pa&s;s without apprehen&s;ion where the gho&s;t has probably pa&s;&s;ed before." They &s;hrunk at this re|proof, and were &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The marquis, turning to a door on his right hand, ordered it to be unlocked. It opened upon the coun|try, and the &s;ervants knew it to be the &s;ame whence the figure had appeared. Having re-locked it, "Lift that trap-door, we will de&s;cend into the vaults," &s;aid the marquis. "What trap-door, my lord?" &s;aid Ro|bert, with encrea&s;ed agitation, "I &s;ee none." The marquis pointed, and Robert perceived a door which lay almo&s;t concealed beneath the &s;tone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that had fallen from the &s;tair ca&s;e above. He began to remove them, when the marquis &s;uddenly turning, "I have already &s;ufficiently indulged your folly," &s;aid he "and am weary of this bu&s;ine&s;s. If you are capable of receiv|ing conviction from truth, you mu&s;t now be convinced that the&s;e buildings are not the haunt of a &s;uper-natur|al being; and if you are incapable, it would be entire|ly u&s;ele&s;s to proceed. You, Robert, may therefore &s;pare your&s;elf the trouble of removing the rubbi&s;h; we will quit this part of the fabric."</P>
<P>The &s;ervants joyfully obeyed, and the marquis lock|ing the &s;everal doors, returned with the keys to the habitable part of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Every inquiry after Julia had hitherto proved fruit|le&s;s, and the imperious nature of the marquis, height|ened by the pre&s;ent vexation, became intolerably op|pre&s;&s;ive to all around him. As the hope of recovering Julia declined, his opinion that Emilia had a&s;&s;i&s;ted her
<PB N="95" REF="029381_0094_0FE0D34C606F11F0">
to e&s;cape &s;trengthened, and he inflicted upon her the &s;everity of his unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions. She was ordered to confine her&s;elf to her apartment till her innocence &s;hould be cleared, or her &s;i&s;ter di&s;covered. From Ma|dame de Menon &s;he received a faithful &s;ympathy, which was the &s;ole relief of her oppre&s;&s;ed heart. Her anxiety concerning Julia daily encrea&s;ed, and was heightened into the mo&s;t terrifying apprehen&s;ion for her &s;afety. She knew of no per&s;on in whom her &s;i&s;ter could confide, or of any place where &s;he could find pro|tection; the mo&s;t deplorable evils were therefore to be expected.</P>
<P>One day as &s;he was &s;itting at the window of her apartment, engaged in melancholy reflexion, &s;he &s;aw a man riding towards the ca&s;tle on full &s;peed. Her heart beat with fear and expectation, for his ha&s;te made her &s;u&s;pect he brought intelligence of Julia, and &s;he could &s;carcely refrain from breaking through the command of the marquis, and ru&s;hing into the hall to learn &s;omething of his errand. She was right in her conjecture; the per&s;on &s;he had &s;een was a &s;py of the marquis's, and came to inform him that the lady Julia was at the time concealed in a cottage of the fore&s;t of Marentino. The marquis rejoiced at this intelligence, and gave the man a liberal reward. He learned al&s;o, that &s;he was accompanied by a young cavalier, which circum&s;tance &s;urpri&s;ed him exceedingly, for he knew of no per&s;on except the count de Vereza with whom &s;he could have entru&s;ted her&s;elf, and the count had fallen by his &s;word! He immediately ordered a party of his people to accompany the me&s;&s;enger to the fore&s;t of Marentino, and to &s;uffer neither Julia nor the cavalier to e&s;cape them on pain of death.</P>
<P>When the duke de Luovo was informed of this di&s;|covery, he entreated and obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="96" REF="029381_0095_0FE0D351CF2E0838">
marquis to join in the pur&s;uit. He immediately &s;et out on the expedition, armed, and followed by a num|ber of his &s;ervants. He re&s;olved to encounter all ha|zards, and to practi&s;e the mo&s;t de&s;perate extremes ra|ther than fail in the object of his enterpri&s;e. In a &s;hort time he overtook the marquis's people, and they pro|ceeded together with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed. The fore&s;t lay &s;everal leagues di&s;tant from the ca&s;tle of Mazzini, and the day was clo&s;ing when they entered upon the borders. The thick foliage of the trees &s;pread a deeper &s;hade around, and they were obliged to proceed with caution. Darkne&s;s had long fallen upon the earth when they reached the cottage, to which they were directed by a light that glimmered from afar among the trees. The duke left his people at &s;ome di&s;tance; and di&s;mounting, and accompanied only by one &s;er|vant, approached the cottage. When he reached it he &s;topped, and looking through the window ob&s;erved a man and woman in the habit of pea&s;ants &s;eated at their &s;upper. They were conver&s;ing with earne&s;tne&s;s, and the duke, hoping to obtain farther intelligence of Julia, endeavoured to li&s;ten to their di&s;cour&s;e. They were prai&s;ing the beauty of a lady whom the duke did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> doubt to be Julia, and the woman &s;poke much in prai&s;e of the cavalier. "He has a noble heart," &s;aid &s;he, "and I am &s;ure by his look belongs to &s;ome great family." "Nay," replied her companion, "the lady is as good as he. I have been at Palermo, and ought to know what great folks are, and if &s;he is not one of them, never take my word again. Poor thing, how &s;he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s take on! It made my heart ach to &s;ee her."</P>
<P>They were &s;ome time &s;ilent. The duke knocked at the door, and inquired of the man who opened it con|cerning the lady and cavalier then in his cottage. He was a&s;&s;ured there were no other per&s;ons in the cottage
<PB N="97" REF="029381_0096_0FE0D357433A56F8">
than tho&s;e he then &s;aw. The duke per&s;i&s;ted in affirm|ing that the per&s;ons he inquired for were there con|cealed, which the man being as re&s;olute in denying, he gave the &s;ignal, and his people approached, and &s;urrounded the cottage. The pea&s;ants, terrified by this circum&s;tance, confe&s;&s;ed that a lady and cavalier, &s;uch as the duke de&s;cribed, had been for &s;ome time concealed in the cottage, but that they were now de|parted.</P>
<P>Su&s;picious of the truth of the latter a&s;&s;ertion, the duke ordered his people to &s;earch the cottage, and that part of the fore&s;t contiguous to it. The &s;earch ended in di&s;appointment. The duke, however, re&s;olved to obtain all po&s;&s;ible information concerning the fugi|tives; and a&s;&s;uming, therefore, a &s;tern air, bade the pea&s;ant, on pain of in&s;tant death, di&s;cover all he knew of them.</P>
<P>The man replied, that on a very dark and &s;tormy night, about a week before, two per&s;ons had come to the cottage, and de&s;ired &s;helter. That they were un|attended, but &s;eemed to be per&s;ons of con&s;equence in di&s;gui&s;e. That they paid very liberally for what they had, and that they departed from the cottage a few hours before the arrival of the duke.</P>
<P>The duke inquired concerning the cour&s;e they had ta|ken, and having received information, re-mounted his hor&s;e, and &s;et forward in pur&s;uit. The road lay for &s;everal leagues through the fore&s;t, and the darkne&s;s, and the probability of encountering banditti, made the journey dangerous. About the break of day, they quitted the fore&s;t, and entered upon a wild and moun|tainous country, in which they travelled &s;ome miles without perceiving a hut, or a human being. No ve&s;tige of cultivation appeared, and no &s;ounds reach|ed them but tho&s;e of their hor&s;es feet, and the roar|ing
<PB N="98" REF="029381_0097_0FE0D35D841C3F00">
of the winds through the deep fore&s;ts that over|hung the mountains. The pur&s;uit was uncertain, but the duke re&s;olved to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>They came at length to a cottage, where he repeated his inquiries, and learned to his &s;atisfaction that two per&s;ons, &s;uch as he de&s;cribed, had &s;topped there for refre&s;hment about two hours before. He found it now nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Bread and milk, the only provi&s;ions of the place, were &s;et before him, and his attendants would have been well contented had there been &s;ufficient of this homely fare to have &s;atisfied their hunger.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patched an ha&s;ty meal, they again &s;et forward in the way pointed out to them as the route of the fugitives. The country a&s;&s;umed a more civil|ized a&s;pect. Corn, vineyards, olives, and groves of mulberry trees adorned the hills. The vallies, luxu|riant in &s;hade, were frequently embelli&s;hed by the windings of a lucid &s;tream, and diver&s;ified by clu&s;ters of half-&s;een cottages. Here the ri&s;ing turrets of a mo|na&s;tery appeared above the thick trees with which they were &s;urrounded; and there the &s;avage wilds, the tra|vellers had pa&s;&s;ed, formed a bold and picture&s;que back|ground to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>To the que&s;tions put by the duke to the &s;everal per|&s;ons he met, he received an&s;wers that encouraged him to proceed. At noon he halted at a village to refre&s;h him&s;elf and his people. He could gain no intelligence of Julia, and was perplexed which way to choo&s;e; but determined at length to pur&s;ue the road he was then in, and accordingly again &s;et forward. He travelled &s;everal miles without meeting any per&s;on who could give the nece&s;&s;ary information, and began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s. The lengthened &s;hadows of the mountains, and the fading light gave &s;ignals of declining day&punc;
<PB N="99" REF="029381_0098_0FE0D362FAF9DEB0">
when having gained the &s;ummit of a high hill, he ob|&s;erved two per&s;ons travelling on hor&s;e-back in the plains below. On one of them he di&s;tingui&s;hed the habiliments of a woman; and in her air he thought he di&s;covered that of Julia. While he &s;tood attentively &s;urveying them, they looked towards the hill, when, as if urged by a &s;udden impul&s;e of terror, they &s;et off on full &s;peed over the plains. The duke had no doubt but that the&s;e were the per&s;ons he &s;ought; and he, therefore, ordered &s;ome of his people to pur&s;ue them, and pu&s;hed his hor&s;e into a full gallop. Before he reached the plains, the fugitives, winding round an abrupt hill, were lo&s;t to his view. The duke conti|nued his cour&s;e, and his people, who were a con&s;ide|rable way before him, at length reached the hill, be|hind which the two per&s;ons had di&s;appeared. No traces of them were to be &s;een, and they entered a nar|row defile between two ranges of high, and &s;avage mountains; on the right of which a rapid &s;tream rol|led along, and broke with its deep re&s;ounding murmurs the &s;olemn &s;ilence of the place. The &s;hades of even|ing now fell thick, and the &s;cene was &s;oon enveloped in darkne&s;s; but to the duke, who was animated by a &s;trong and impetuous pa&s;&s;ion, the&s;e were unimport|ant circum&s;tances. Although he knew that the wilds of Sicily were frequently infe&s;ted with banditti, his numbers made him fearle&s;s of attack. Not &s;o his at|tendants, many of whom, as the darkne&s;s increa&s;ed, te&s;tified emotions not very honourable to their courage; &s;tarting at every bu&s;h, and believing it concealed a mur|derer. They endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade the duke from proceeding, expre&s;&s;ing uncertainty of their being in the right route, and recommending the open plains. But the duke, who&s;e eye had been vigilant to mark the flight of the fugitives, and who was not to be di&s;|&s;uaded
<PB N="100" REF="029381_0099_0FE0D57B74D694B0">
from his purpo&s;e, quickly repre&s;&s;ed their argu|ments. They continued their cour&s;e without meeting a &s;ingle per&s;on.</P>
<P>The moon now ro&s;e, and afforded them a &s;hadowy imperfect view of the &s;urrounding objects. The pro&s;|pect was gloomy and va&s;t, and not a human habitation met their eyes. They had now lo&s;t every trace of the fugitives, and found them&s;elves bewildered in a wild and &s;avage country. Their only remaining care was to extricate them&s;elves from &s;o forlorn a &s;ituation, and they li&s;tened at every &s;tep with anxious attention, for &s;ome &s;ound that might di&s;cover to them the haunts of men. They li&s;tened in vain; the &s;tillne&s;s of night was undi&s;turbed but by the wind, which broke at intervals in low and hollow murmurs from among the mountains.</P>
<P>As they proceeded with &s;ilent caution, they per|ceived a light break from among the rocks at &s;ome di&s;|tance. The duke he&s;itated whether to approach, &s;ince it might probably proceed from a party of the banditti with which the&s;e mountains were &s;aid to be infe&s;ted. While he he&s;itated, it di&s;appeared; but he had not advanced many &s;teps when it returned. He now per|ceived it i&s;&s;ue from the mouth of a cavern, and ca&s;t a bright reflexion upon the overhanging rocks and &s;hrubs.</P>
<P>He di&s;mounted, and followed by two of his people, leaving the re&s;t at &s;ome di&s;tance, moved with &s;low and &s;ilent &s;teps towards the cave. As he drew near he heard the &s;ound of many voices in high carou&s;al. Sud|denly the uproar cea&s;ed, and the following words were &s;ung by a clear and manly voice:

<P>The la&s;t ver&s;e was repeated in loud chorus. The duke li&s;tened with a&s;toni&s;hment! Such &s;ocial merri|ment, amid a &s;cene of &s;uch &s;avage wildne&s;s, appeared more like enchantment than reality. He would not have he&s;itated to pronounce this a party of banditti, had not the delicacy of expre&s;&s;ion, pre&s;erved in the &s;ong, appeared unattainable by men of their cla&s;s.</P>
<P>He had now a full view of the cave, and the moment which convinced him of his error, &s;erved al&s;o to en|crea&s;e his &s;urpri&s;e. He beheld by the light of a fire, a party of banditti &s;eated within the deepe&s;t rece&s;s of the cave, round a rude kind of table formed in the rock. The table was &s;pread with provi&s;ions, and they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egaling them&s;elves with great eagerne&s;s and joy. The countenances of the men exhibited a &s;trange mix|ture of fiercene&s;s and &s;ociality; and the duke could almo&s;t have imagined he beheld in the&s;e robbere a band of the early Romans before knowledge had civilized, or luxury had &s;oftened them. But he had not much time for meditation&mdash;a &s;en&s;e of his danger bade him fly, while to fly was yet in his power.</P>
<P>As he turned to depart, he ob&s;erved two &s;addle hor&s;es grazing upon the herbage near the mouth of the cave. It in&s;tantly occurred to him that they belonged to Julia, and her companion. He he&s;itated, and at length determined to linger awhile, and li&s;ten to the conver&s;ation of the robbers, hoping from thence to
<PB N="102" REF="029381_0101_0FE0D3729D89F748">
have his doubts re&s;olved. They talked for &s;ome time in a &s;train of high coviviality, and recounted in exulta|tion many of their exploits. They de&s;cribed al&s;o the be|haviour of &s;everal people whom they had robbed, with highly ludicrous allu&s;ions, and with much rude humour; while the cave re-echoed with loud bur&s;ts of laughter and applau&s;e. They were thus engaged in tumultuous merriment, till one of them cur&s;ing the &s;canty plunder of their late adventure, but prai&s;ing the beauty of a lady, they all lowered their voices together, and &s;eemed as if debating upon a point uncommonly inte|re&s;ting to them. The pa&s;&s;ions of the duke were rou&s;ed, and he became certain that it was Julia of whom they had &s;poken. In the fir&s;t impul&s;e of feeling, he drew his &s;word; but recollecting the number of his adver&s;aries, re&s;trained his fury. He was returning from the cave, with a de&s;ign of &s;ummoning his people, when the light of the fire glittering upon the bright blade of his weapon, caught the eye of one of the ban|ditti. He &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and his comrades in|&s;tantly ri&s;ing in con&s;ternation, di&s;covered the duke. They ru&s;hed with loud vociferation towards the mouth of the cave. He endeavoured to e&s;cape to his people; but two of the banditti mounting the hor&s;es which were grazing near, quickly overtook and &s;eized him. His dre&s;s and air proclaimed him to be a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, and rejoicing in their pro&s;pect of plunder, they forced him towards the cave. Here their com|rades awaited them, but what were the emotions of the duke, when he di&s;covered in the per&s;on of the principal robber, his own &s;on! who to e&s;cape the gall|ing &s;everity of his father, had fled from his ca&s;tle &s;ome years before, and had not been heard of &s;ince.</P>
<P>He had placed him&s;elf at the head of a party of
<PB N="103" REF="029381_0102_0FE0D3781524F6C0">
banditti, and plea&s;ed with the liberty which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en he had never ta&s;ted, and with the power which his new &s;ituation afforded him, he became &s;o much at|tached to this wild and lawle&s;s mode of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that he determined never to quit it till death &s;hould di&s;&s;olve tho&s;e ties which now made his rank only oppre&s;&s;ive. This event &s;eemed at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that he &s;el|dom allowed him&s;elf to think of it. Whenever it &s;hould happen, he had no doubt that he might either re&s;ume his rank without danger of di&s;covery, or might ju&s;tify his pre&s;ent conduct as a frolick which a few acts of genero&s;ity would ea&s;ily excu&s;e. He knew his power would then place him beyond the reach of cen&s;ure, in a country where the people are accu&s;tomed to implicit &s;ubordination, and &s;eldom dare to &s;crutinize the actions of the nobility.</P>
<P>His &s;en&s;ations, however, on di&s;covering his father, were not very plea&s;ing; but proclaiming the duke, he protected him from farther outrage.</P>
<P>With the duke, who&s;e heart was a &s;tranger to the &s;ofter affections, indignation u&s;urped the place of pa|rental feeling. His pride was the only pa&s;&s;ion affected by the di&s;covery; and he had the ra&s;hne&s;s to expre&s;s the indignation, which the conduct of his &s;on had ex|cited, in terms of unre&s;trained invective. The ban|ditti, inflamed by the opprobrium with which he loaded their order, threatened in&s;tant puni&s;hment to his te|merity; and the authority of Riccardo could hardly re&s;train them within the limits of forbearance.</P>
<P>The menaces, and at length entreaties, of the duke, to prevail with his &s;on to abandon his pre&s;ent way of life, were equally ineffectual. Secure in his own power, Riccardo laughed at the fir&s;t, and was in&s;en&s;ible to the latter; and his father was compelled to relinqui&s;h the attempt. The duke, however, boldly and pa&s;&s;ionately
<PB N="104" REF="029381_0103_0FE0D37D81FE8F20">
accu&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m of having plundered and &s;ecreted a lady and cavalier, his friends, at the &s;ame time de&s;cribing Julia, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e liberation he offered large rewards, Riccardo d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the fact, which &s;o much exa&s;perated the duke, that he drew his &s;word with an intention of plunging it in the brea&s;t of his &s;on. His arm was ar|re&s;ted by the &s;urrounding banditti, who half un&s;heathed their &s;words, and &s;tood &s;u&s;pended in an attitude of menace. The fate of the father now hung upon the voice of the &s;on. Riccardo rai&s;ed his arm, but in|&s;tantly dropped it, and turned away. The banditti &s;heathed their weapons, and &s;tepped back.</P>
<P>Riccardo &s;olemnly &s;wearing that he knew nothing of the per&s;ons de&s;cribed, the duke at length became convinced of the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion, and departing from the cave, rejoined his people. All the impetuous pa&s;&s;ions of his nature were rou&s;ed and inflamed by the di&s;covery of his &s;on, in a &s;ituation &s;o wretchedly di&s;|graceful. Yet it was his pride rather than his virtue that was hurt; and when he wi&s;hed him dead, it was rather to &s;ave him&s;elf from di&s;grace, than his &s;on from the real indignity of vice. He had no means of re|claiming him; to have attempted it by force, would have been at this time the exce&s;s of temerity, for his at|tendants, though numerous, were undi&s;ciplined, and would have fallen certain victims to the power of a &s;avage and dexterous banditti.</P>
<P>With thoughts agitated in fierce and agonizing con|flict, he pur&s;ued his journey; and having lo&s;t all trace of Julia, &s;ought only for an habitation which might &s;helter him from the night, and afford nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;h|ment for him&s;elf and his people. With this, how|ever, there appeared little hope of meeting.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE night grew &s;tormy. The hollow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds &s;wept over the mountains, and blew bleak and cold around; the clouds were driven &s;wiftly over the face of the moon, and the duke and his people were frequently involved in total darkne&s;s. They had travelled on &s;i|lently and dejectedly for &s;ome hours, and were bewil|dered in the wilds, when they &s;uddenly heard the bell of a mona&s;tery chiming for midnight prayer. Their hearts revived at the &s;ound, which they endeavoured to follow, but they had not gone far, when the gale wa&s;t|ed it away, and they were abandoned to the uncertain guide of their own conjectures.</P>
<P>They had pur&s;ued for &s;ome time the way which they judged led to the mona&s;tery, when the note of the bell returned upon the wind, and di&s;covered to them that they had mi&s;taken their route. After much wandering and difficulty they arrived, overcome with wearine&s;s, at the gates of a large and gloomy fabric. The bell had cea&s;ed and all was &s;till. By the moon-light, which through broken clouds clouds now &s;treamed upon the building, they became convinced it was the mona&s;tery they had &s;ought, and the duke him&s;elf &s;truck loudly upon the gate.</P>
<P>Several minutes elap&s;ed, no per&s;on appeared, and he repeated the &s;troke. A &s;tep was pre&s;ently heard with|in, the gate was unbarred, and a thin &s;hivering figure pre&s;ented it&s;elf. The duke &s;olicited admi&s;&s;ion, but was refu&s;ed, and reprimanded for di&s;turbing the convent at the hour &s;acred to prayer. He then made known his rank, and bade the friar inform the Superior that he reque&s;ted &s;helter from the night. The friar, &s;u&s;pi|cious
<PB N="106" REF="029381_0105_0FE0D38A162B6658">
of deceit, and apprehen&s;ive of robbers, refu&s;ed with much firmne&s;s, and repeated that the convent was engaged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prayer; he had almo&s;t clo&s;ed the gate, when the duke, whom hunger and fatigue made de&s;|perate, ru&s;hed by him, and pa&s;&s;ed into the court. It was his intention to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to the Superior, and he had not proceeded far when the &s;ound of laugh|ter and of many voices in loud and mirthful jollity, attracted his &s;teps. It led him through &s;everal pa&s;|&s;ages to a door, through the crevices of which light appeared. He pau&s;ed a moment, and heard within a wild uproar of merriment and &s;ong. He was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, and could &s;carcely credit his &s;en&s;es!</P>
<P>He unclo&s;ed the door, and beheld in a large room, well lighted, a company of friars, dre&s;t in the habit of their order, placed round a table, which was profu&s;ely &s;pread with wines and fruits. The Superior, who&s;e habit di&s;tingui&s;hed him from his a&s;&s;ociates, appeared at the head of the table. He was lifting a large gob|let of wine to his lips, and was roaring out, "Pro|fu&s;ion and confu&s;ion," at the moment when the duke entered. His appearance cau&s;ed a general alarm; that part of the company who were not too much in|toxicated, aro&s;e from their &s;eats; and the Superior, dropping the goblet from his hands, endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume a look of au&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, which his ro&s;y countenance belied. The duke received a reprimand, delivered in the li&s;ping accents of ixtoxication, and embelli&s;hed with frequent interjections of hiccup. He made known his quality, his di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;olicited a night's lodging for him&s;elf and his people. When the Supe|rior under&s;tood the di&s;tinction of his gue&s;t, his fea|tures relaxed into a &s;mile of joyous welcome; and ta|king him by the hand, he placed him by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>The table was quickly covered with luxurious pro|vi&s;ions, and orders were given that the duke's people
<PB N="107" REF="029381_0106_0FE0D38E7B0C0EF0">
&s;hould be admitted, and taken care of&punc; He was re|galed with a variety of the fine&s;t wines, and at length, highly elevated by mona&s;tic ho&s;pitality, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e retired to the apartment allotted him, leaving the Superior in a condition which precluded all ceremony.</P>
<P>He departed in the morning, very well plea&s;ed with the accommodating principles of mona&s;tic religion. He had been told that the enjoyment of the good things of this life was the &s;ure&s;t &s;ign of our gratitude to Heaven; and it appeared, that within the walls of a Sicilian mona&s;tery, the precept and the practice were equally enforced.</P>
<P>He was now at a lo&s;s what cour&s;e to choo&s;e, for he had no clue to direct him towards the object of his pur&s;uit; but hope &s;till invigorated, and urged him to per&s;everance. He was not many leagues from the coa&s;t; and it occurred to him, that the fugitives might make towards it with a de&s;ign of e&s;caping into Italy. He therefore determined to travel towards the &s;ea, and proceed along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>At the hou&s;e where he &s;topped to dine, he learned that two per&s;ons, &s;uch as he de&s;cribed, had halted there about an hour before his arrival, and had &s;et off again in much &s;eeming ha&s;te. They had taken the road towards the coa&s;t, where it was obvious to the duke they de&s;igned to embark&punc; He &s;tayed not to fini&s;h the repa&s;t &s;et before him, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;tantly re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unt|ed to continue the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>To the inquiries he made of the per&s;ons he chanc|ed to meet, favourable an&s;wers were returned for a time, but he was at length bewildered in uncertainty, and travelled for &s;ome hours in a direction which chance, rather than judgment, prompted him to take.</P>
<P>The falling evening again confu&s;ed his pro&s;pects, and un&s;ettled his hopes. The &s;hades were deepened
<PB N="108" REF="029381_0107_0FE0D3951D1A7468">
by thick and heavy clouds that enveloped the horizon, and the deep &s;ounding air foretold a tempe&s;t. The thunder now rolled at a di&s;tance, and the accumulated clouds grew darker. The duke and his people were on a wild and dreary heath, round which they looked in vain for &s;helter, the view being terminated on all &s;ides by the &s;ame de&s;olate &s;cene. They rode, how|ever, as hard as their hor&s;es would carry them; and at length one of the attendants e&s;pied on the &s;kirts of the wa&s;te a large man&s;ion, towards which they immediate|ly directed their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>They were overtaken by the &s;torm, and at the mo|ment when they reached the building, a peal of thun|der, which &s;eemed to &s;hake the pile, bur&s;t over their heads. They now found them&s;elves in a large and ancient man&s;ion, which &s;eemed totally de&s;erted, and was falling to decay. The edifice was di&s;tingui&s;hed by an air of magnificence, which ill accorded with the &s;urrounding &s;cenery, and which excited &s;ome degree of &s;urpri&s;e in the mind of the duke, who, however fully ju&s;tified the owner in for&s;aking a &s;pot, which pre&s;ented to the eye only views of rude and de&s;olated nature.</P>
<P>The &s;torm encrea&s;ed with much violence, and threat|ened to detain the duke a pri&s;oner in his pre&s;ent habi|tation for the night. The hall, of which he and his people had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, exhibited in every feature marks of ruin and de&s;olation. The marble pavement was in many places broken, the walls were mouldering into decay, and round the high and &s;hattered windows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he long gra&s;s waved to the lonely gale. Curio&s;ity led him to explore the rece&s;&s;es of the man&s;ion. He quitted the hall, and entered upon a pa&s;&s;age which conducted him to a remote part of the edifice. He wandered through the wild and &s;pacious apartments in gloomy meditation, and often pau&s;ed in wonder at the remains of magnificence which he beheld.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="029381_0108_0FE0D39968B89368">The man&s;ion was irregular and va&s;t, and he was be|wildered in its intricacies. In endeavouring to find his way back, he only perplexed him&s;elf more, till at length he arrived at a door, which he believed led into the hall he fir&s;t quitted. On opening it, he di&s;|covered by the faint light of the moon, a large place, which he &s;carcely knew whether to think a cloi&s;ter, a chapel, or a hall. It retired in long per&s;pective, in arches, and terminated in a large iron gate, through which appeared the open country.</P>
<P>The lightnings fla&s;hed thick and blue around, which together with the thunder, that &s;eemed to rend the wide arch of Heaven, and the melancholy a&s;pect of the place, &s;o awed the duke, that he involuntarily called to his people. His voice was an&s;wered only by the deep echoes which ran in murmurs through the place, and died away at di&s;tance; and the moon now &s;inking be|hind a cloud, left him in total darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>He repeated the call more loudly, and at length heard the approach of foot&s;teps. A few moments re|lieved him from his anxiety, for his people appeared. The &s;torm was yet loud, and the heavy and &s;ulphure|ous appearance of the atmo&s;phere promi&s;ed no &s;peedy abatement of it. The duke endeavoured to reconcile him&s;elf to pa&s;s the night in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and ordered a fire to be lighted in the place he was in. This with much difficulty was accompli&s;hed. He then threw him&s;elf on the pavement before it, and tried to endure the ab&s;tinence which he had &s;o ill ob|&s;erved in the mona&s;tery on the preceding night. But to his great joy his attendants, more provident than him&s;elf, had not &s;crupled to accept a comfortable quantity of provi&s;ions which had been offered them at the mona&s;tery; and which they now drew forth from a wallet. They were &s;pread upon the pavement; and
<PB N="110" REF="029381_0109_0FE0D39ED21A6258">
the duke, after refre&s;hing him&s;elf, delivered up the re|remains to his people. Having ordered them to watch by turns at the gate, he wrap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cloak round him, and re&s;igned him&s;elf to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The night pa&s;&s;ed without any di&s;turbance. The morning aro&s;e fre&s;h and bright; the Heavens exhibit|ed a clear and unclouded concave; even the wild heath, refre&s;hed by the late rains, &s;miled around, and &s;ent up with the morning gale a &s;tream of fragrance.</P>
<P>The duke quitted the man&s;ion, reanimated by the cheerfulne&s;s of morn, and pur&s;ued his journey. He could gain no intelligence of the fugitives. About noon he found him&s;elf in a beautifully romantic coun|try; and having reached the &s;ummit of &s;ome wild cliffs, he re&s;ted to view the picture&s;que imagery of the &s;cene below. A &s;hadowy &s;eque&s;tered dell appeared buried deep among the rocks, and in the bottom was &s;een a lake, who&s;e clear bo&s;om reflected the impending cliffs, and the beautiful luxuriance of the overhanging &s;hades.</P>
<P>But his attention was quickly called from the beau|ties of inanimate nature, to objects more intere&s;ting; for he ob&s;erved two per&s;ons, whom he in&s;tantly re|collected to be the &s;ame that he had formerly pur&s;ued over the plains. They were &s;eated on the margin of the lake, under the &s;hade of &s;ome high trees at the foot of the rocks, and &s;eemed partaking of a repa&s;t which was &s;pread upon the gra&s;s. Two hor&s;es were grazing near. In the lady the duke &s;aw the very air and &s;hape of Julia, and his heart bounded at the &s;ight. They were &s;eated with their backs to the cliffs upon which the duke &s;tood, and he therefore &s;urveyed them unob&s;erv|ed. They were now almo&s;t within his power, but the difficulty was how to de&s;cend the rocks, who&s;e &s;tupen|dous heights, and craggy &s;teeps &s;eemed to render

them imputable. He examined them with a &s;cruti|nizing eye, and at length e&s;pied, where the rock re|ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, a narrow winding &s;ort of path. He di&s;mount|ed, and &s;ome of his attendants doing the &s;ame, follow|ed their lord down the cliffs, treading lightly, le&s;t their &s;teps &s;hould betray them. Immediately upon their reaching the bottom, they were perceived by the lady, who fled among the rocks, and was pre&s;ently pur&s;ued by the duke's people. The cavalier had no time to e&s;cape, but drew his &s;word, and defended him|&s;elf again&s;t the furious a&s;&s;ault of the duke.</P>
<P>The combat was &s;u&s;tained with much vigour and dexterity on both &s;ides for &s;ome minutes, when the duke received the point of his adver&s;ary's &s;word, and fell. The cavalier, endeavouring to e&s;cape, was &s;eized by the duke's people, who now appeared with the fair fugitive;&mdash;but what was the di&s;appointment&mdash;the rage of the duke, when in the per&s;on of the lady he di&s;covered a &s;tranger! The a&s;toni&s;hment was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; but the accompanying feelings were, in the different per&s;ons, of a very oppo&s;ite nature. In the duke, a&s;|toni&s;hment was heightened by vexation, and embitter|ed by di&s;appointment:&mdash; in the lady, it was &s;oftened by the joy of unexpected deliverance.</P>
<P>This lady was the younger daughter of a Sicilian nobleman, who&s;e avarice, or nece&s;&s;ities, had devoted her to a convent. To avoid the threatened fate, &s;he fled with the lover to whom her affections had long been engaged, and who&s;e only fault, even in the eye of her father, was inferiority of birth. They were now on their way to the coa&s;t, whence they de|&s;igned to pa&s;s over to Italy, where the church would confirm the bonds which their hearts had already formed. There the friends of the cavalier re&s;ided, and with them they expected to find a &s;ecure retreat.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="029381_0111_0FE0D3AC0ED69D50">The duke, who was not materially wounded, after the fir&s;t tran&s;port of his rage had &s;ub&s;ided, &s;uffered them them to depart. Relieved from their fears, they joyfully &s;et forward, leaving their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate pur&s;uer to the angui&s;h of defeat, and fruitle&s;s endeavour. He was remounted on his hor&s;e; and having di&s;patched two of his people in &s;earch of a hou&s;e where he might ob|tain &s;ome relief, he proceeded &s;lowly on his return to the ca&s;tle of Mazzini.</P>
<P>It was not long ere he recollected a circum&s;tance which, in the fir&s;t tumult of his di&s;appointment, had e&s;caped him, but which &s;o e&s;&s;entially affected the whole tenour of his hopes, as to make him again irre&s;olute how to proceed. He con&s;idered that, although the&s;e were the fugitives he had pur&s;ued over the plains, they might not be the &s;ame who had been &s;ecreted in the cottage, and it was therefore po&s;&s;ible that Julia might have been the per&s;on whom they had for &s;ome time fol|lowed from thence. This &s;ugge&s;tion awakened his hopes, which were however quickly de&s;troyed; for he remembered that the only per&s;ons, who could have &s;atisfied his doubts were now gone beyond the power of recall. To pur&s;ue Julia, when no traces of her flight remained, was ab&s;urd; and he was therefore compelled to return to the marquis, as ignorant and more hopele&s;s than he had left him. With much pains he reached the village which his emi&s;&s;aries had di&s;co|vered, where fortunately he obtained &s;ome medical a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Here he was obliged by indi&s;po&s;ition to re&s;t. The angui&s;h of his mind equalled that of his body&punc; Tho&s;e impetuous pa&s;&s;ions which &s;o &s;trongly mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his nature, were rou&s;ed and exa&s;perated to a deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that operated powerfully upon his con&s;titution, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> threatened him with the mo&s;t alarming con&s;equences.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE ca&s;tle of Mazzini was &s;till the &s;cene of di&s;|&s;ention and mi&s;ery. The impatience and a&s;toni&s;hment of the marquis being daily increa&s;ed by the lengthened ab&s;ence of the duke, he di&s;patched &s;ervants to the fore&s;t of Marentino, to inquire the occa&s;ion of this circum|&s;tance. They returned with intelligence, that neither Julia, the duke, nor any of his people were there. He therefore concluded, that his daughter had fled the cottage upon information of the approach of the duke, who, he believed, was &s;till engaged in the pur&s;uit. With re&s;pect to Ferdinand, who yet pined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;orrow and anxiety in his dungeon, the rigour of the mar|quis's conduct was unabated. He apprehended that his &s;on, if liberated, would quickly di&s;cover the re|treat of Julia, and by his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, confirm her in di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Ferdinand in the &s;tillne&s;s and &s;olitude of his dungeon brooded over the late calamity in gloomy ineffectual lamentation. The idea of Hippolitus&mdash;of Hippolitus murdered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e to his imagination in bu&s;y intru&s;ion, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;tronge&s;t efforts of his &s;olitude.

heighten by contra&s;t, the ob&s;curity and gloom of his pre&s;ent views. He had, however, a new &s;ubject of a&s;toni&s;hment, which often withdrew his thoughts from their accu&s;tomed object, and &s;ub&s;tituted a &s;en&s;ation le&s;s painful, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough &s;carcely le&s;s powerful. One night, as he lay ruminating on the pa&s;t in melancholy dejection, the &s;tillne&s;s of the place was &s;uddenly interrupted by a low and di&s;mal &s;ound. It returned at intervals in hol|low &s;ighings, and &s;eemed to come from &s;ome per&s;on in deep di&s;tre&s;s. So much did fear operate upon his mind, that he was uncertain whether it aro&s;e from within or from without. He looked round his dungeon, but could di&s;tingui&s;h no object through the impenetrable darkne&s;s. As he li&s;tened in deep amazement, the &s;ound was repeated in moans more hollow. Terror now occupied his mind, and di&s;turbed his rea&s;on; he &s;tarted from his po&s;ture, and, determined to be &s;atisfi|ed whether any per&s;on be&s;ide him&s;elf was in the dun|geon, groped, with arms extended, along the walls. The place was empty, but coming to a particular &s;pot, the &s;ound &s;uddenly aro&s;e more di&s;tinctly to his ear. He called aloud, and a&s;ked who was there; but re|ceived no an&s;wer.

At this conviction, horr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thrilled his nerves; but he remembered his oath, and was &s;ilent.

<P>The mind of Ferdinand was highly &s;uperior to the general influence of &s;uper&s;tition; but, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance &s;uch &s;trong correlative circum&s;tances appeared as compelled even incredulity to yield.

All the&s;e recollections pre&s;ented to Ferdinand a chain of evidence too powerful to be re|&s;i&s;ted, and he could not doubt that the &s;pirit of the dead had for once been permitted to revi&s;it the earth, and to call <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> vengeance on the de&s;cendant of the murderer.</P>

<P>Peter, who&s;e friend&s;hip was &s;tronger than his cour|age, trembled with apprehen&s;ion as the hour drew nigh in which the groans had been heard on the preceding night. He recounted to Ferdinand a variety of terri|fic circum&s;tances, which exi&s;ted only in the heated ima|ginations of his fellow &s;ervants, but which were &s;till admitted by them as facts. Among the re&s;t, he did not omit to mention the light and the figure, which had been &s;een to i&s;&s;ue from the &s;outh tower on the night of Julia's intended elopement; a circum&s;tance which he embelli&s;hed with innumerable aggravations of fear and wonder. He concluded with de&s;cribing the general con&s;ternation it had cau&s;ed, and the con&s;equent be|haviour of the marquis, who laughed at the fears of his people, yet conde&s;cended to quiet them by a formal re|view of the buildings, whence their terror had origi|nated. He related the adventure of the door, which refu&s;ed to yield&mdash;the &s;ounds which aro&s;e from within, and the di&s;covery of the fallen roof; but declared, that neither he, nor any of his fellow-&s;ervants believed the noi&s;e, or the ob&s;truction proceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from that, "becau&s;e, my lord," continued he, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eem|ed to be held only in one place; and as for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ife&mdash; O!

who had thus expo&s;ed to the in&s;pection of his people that dreadful &s;pot which he knew from experi|ence to be the haunt of an injured &s;pirit; a &s;pot which he had hitherto &s;crupulou&s;ly concealed from human eye, and human curio&s;ity; and which, for &s;o many years, he had not dared even him&s;elf to enter. Peter went on, but was pre&s;ently interrupted by a hollow moan, which &s;eemed to come from beneath the ground. "Ble&s;&s;ed virgin!" exclaimed he: Ferdinand li&s;tened in awful expectation. A groan longer and more dreadful was repeated, when Peter &s;tarting from his &s;eat, and &s;natching up the lamp, ru&s;hed out of the dungeon. Ferdinand, who was left in total darkne&s;s, followed to the door, which the affrighted Peter had not &s;topped to fa&s;ten, but which had clo&s;ed, and &s;eem|ed held by a lock that could be opened only on the out&s;ide. The &s;en&s;ations of Ferdinand, thus compelled to remain in the dungeon, are not to be imagined. The horrors of the night, whatever they were to be, he was to endure alone. By degrees, however, he &s;eemed to acquire the valour of de&s;pair. The &s;ounds were repeated at intervals for near an hour, when &s;i|lence returned, and remained undi&s;turbed during the re&s;t of the night. Ferdinand was alarmed by no ap|pearance; and at length, overcome with anxiety and watching, he &s;unk to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the following morning Peter returned to the dungeon, &s;carcely knowing what to expect, yet ex|pecting &s;omething very &s;trange, perhaps the murder&mdash; perhaps the &s;upernatural di&s;appearance of his young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord. Full of the&s;e wild apprehen&s;ions, he dared not endure thither alone, but per&s;uaded &s;ome of the &s;er|vants, to whom he had communicated his terrors, to accompany him to the door.

He hurried to the door, and his &s;urpri&s;e was extreme to find it fa&s;tened It in&s;tantly &s;truck him that this was the work of a &s;upernatural power; when, on calling alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he was an&s;wered by a voice from within.

There the uproar occa&s;ioned by their entrance called together a number of per&s;ons, among&s;t whom was the marquis, who was &s;oon informed of the cau&s;e of alarm, with a long hi&s;tory of the circum&s;tances of the foregoing night.

He reminded them of the conde&s;cen&s;ion he had prac|ti&s;ed to di&s;&s;ipate their former terrors, and of the re&s;ult of their examination.

The marquis darting upon him a &s;evere look, which he perfectly comprehended&mdash; "Now," cried he, turning to his people, "what do you feel My &s;on, whom I my&s;elf placed here, and who&s;e voice, which an&s;wered to your calls, you have transformed into unknown &s;ounds.

"None my lord," replied Ferdinand, who too well under&s;tood the manner of the marquis. "Tis well," cried the marquis, "and this is the la&s;t time," turning to his attendants, "that your folly &s;hall be treated with &s;o much lenity." He cea&s;ed to urge the &s;ubject, and forbore to a&s;k Ferdinand even one que&s;tion before his &s;ervants, concerning the nocturnal &s;ounds de&s;cribed by Peter. He quitted the dungeon with eyes &s;teadily bent in anger and &s;u&s;picion upon Ferdinand. The marquis &s;u&s;pected that the fears of his &s;on had inad|vertently betrayed to Peter a part of the &s;ecret intru&s;ted to him, and he artfully interrogated Peter with &s;eem|ing carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, concerning the circum&s;tances of the preceding night. From him he drew &s;uch an&s;wers as honourably acquitted Ferdinand of indi&s;cretion, and relieved him&s;elf from tormenting apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The following night pa&s;&s;ed quietly away; neither &s;ound nor appearance di&s;turbed the peace of Ferdinand. The marquis, on the next day, thought proper to &s;of|ten the &s;everity of his &s;ufferings, and he was removed from his dungeon to a room &s;trongly grated, but ex|po&s;ed to the light of day.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="029381_0119_0FE0D3DE26433A20">Meanwhile a circum&s;tance occurred which increa&s;ed the general di&s;cord, and threatened Emilia with the lo&s;s of her la&s;t remaining comfort&mdash;the advice and con|&s;olation of Madame de Menon. The marchione&s;s, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for the count de Vereza had at length yielded to ab&s;ence, and the pre&s;&s;ure of pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, now be&s;towed her &s;miles upon a young Italian cavalier, a vi&s;itor at the ca&s;tle, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too much of the &s;pirit of gallantry to permit a lady to langui&s;h in vain. The marquis, who&s;e mind was occupied with other pa&s;&s;ions, was in&s;en&s;ible to the mi&s;conduct of his wife, who at all times had the addre&s;s to di&s;gui&s;e her vices beneath the glo&s;s of virtue and innocent freedom. The intrigue was di&s;covered by Madame, who, hav|ing one day left a book in the oak parlour, returned thither in &s;earch of it. As &s;he opened the door of the apartment, &s;he heard the voice of the cavalier in pa&s;|&s;ionate exclamation; and on entering, di&s;covered him ri&s;ing in &s;ome confu&s;ion from the feet of the marchi|one&s;s, who, darting at Madame a look of &s;everity, aro&s;e from her &s;eat. Madame, &s;hocked at what &s;he had &s;een, in&s;tantly retired, and buried in her own bo|&s;om that &s;ecret, the di&s;covery of which would mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially have poi&s;oned the peace of the marquis. The marchione&s;s, who was a &s;tranger to the genero&s;ity of &s;entiment which actuated Madame de Menon, doubted not that &s;he would &s;eize the moment of re|taliation, and expo&s;e her conduct where mo&s;t &s;he dreaded it &s;hould be known&punc; The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt tortured her with ince&s;&s;ant fear of di&s;covery, and from this period her who&s;e attention was employed to di&s;|lodge from the ca&s;tle, the per&s;on to whom her charac|ter was committed. In this it was not difficult to &s;uc|ceed; for the delicacy of Madame's feelings made her quick to perceive, and to withdraw from a treatment

un&s;uitable to the natural dignity of her character. She therefore re&s;olved to depart from the ca&s;tle; but di&s;|daining to take an advantage even over a &s;ucce&s;sful enemy, &s;he determined to be &s;ilent on that &s;ubject which would in&s;tantly have transferred the triumph from her adver&s;ary to her&s;elf. When the marquis, on hearing her determination to retire, earne&s;tly inquired for the motive of her conduct &s;he forbore to acquaint him with the real one, and left him to incertitude and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>To Emilia this de&s;ign occa&s;ioned a di&s;tre&s;s which almo&s;t &s;ubdued the re&s;olution of Madame. Her tears and intreaties &s;poke the artle&s;s energy of &s;orrow. In Madame &s;he lo&s;t her only friend; and &s;he too well un|der&s;tood the value of that friend, to &s;ee her depart without feeling and expre&s;&s;ing the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. From a &s;trong attachment to the memory of the mo|ther, Madame had been induced to undertake the education of her daughters, who&s;e engaging di&s;po&s;i|tions had perpetuated a kind of hereditary affection. Regard for Emilia and Julia had alone for &s;ome time detained her at the ca&s;tle; but this was now &s;ucceeded by the influence of con&s;iderations too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted. As her income was &s;mall, it was her plan to retire to her native place, which was &s;ituated in a di&s;|tant part of the i&s;land, and there take up her re&s;idence in a convent.</P>
<P>Emilia &s;aw the time of Madame's departure approach with increa&s;ed di&s;tre&s;s. They left each other with a mutual &s;orrow, which did honour to their hearts. When her la&s;t friend was gone, Emilia wandered through the for&s;aken apartments, where &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to conver&s;e with Julia, and to recieve con|&s;olation and &s;ympathy from her dear in&s;tructre&s;s, with a kind of angui&s;h known only to tho&s;e who have ex|perienced

a &s;imilar &s;ituation. Madame pur&s;ued her journey with a heavy heart. Separated from the ob|jects of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fonde&s;t affections, and from the &s;cenes and occupations for which long habit had formed claims upon her heart, &s;he &s;eemed without intere&s;t and with|out motive for exertion.

<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of day Madame arrived at a &s;mall village &s;ituated among the mountains, where &s;he purpo&s;ed to pa&s;s the night. The evening was re|markably fine, and the grote&s;que beauty of the &s;ur|rounding &s;cenery invited her to walk. She followed the windings of a &s;tream, which was lo&s;t at &s;ome di&s;|tance among luxuriant groves of che&s;nut. The rich colouring of evening glowed through the dark foliage, which &s;preading a pen&s;ive gloom around, offered a

&s;cene congenial to the pre&s;ent temper of her mind, and &s;he entered the &s;hades. Her thoughts, affected by the &s;urrounding objects, gradually &s;unk into a plea&s;ing and complacent melancholy, and &s;he was in&s;en&s;ibly led on. She &s;till followed the cour&s;e of the &s;tream to where the deep &s;hades retired, and the &s;cene again opening to day, yielded to her a view &s;o various and &s;ublime, that &s;he pau&s;ed in thrilling and delightful wonder. A group of wild and gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;que rocks ro&s;e in a &s;emicircu|lar form, and their fanta&s;tic &s;hapes exhibited Nature in her mo&s;t &s;ublime and &s;triking attitudes. Here her va&s;t magnificence elevated the mind of the beholder with high enthu&s;ia&s;m. Fancy caught the thrilling &s;en&s;ation, and at her touch the towering &s;teeps became &s;haded with unreal glooms; the caves more darkly frowned&mdash;the projecting cliffs a&s;&s;ured a more terrific a&s;pect, and the wild overhanging &s;hrubs waved to the gale in deeper murmurs. The &s;cene in&s;pired Madame with reverential awe, and her thoughts involuntarily ro&s;e "from Nature up to Nature's God." The la&s;t dying gleams of day tinted the rocks and &s;hone upon the waters, which retired through a rugged channel, and were lo&s;t afar among the receding cliffs. While &s;he li&s;tened to their di&s;tant murmur, a voice of liquid and melodious &s;weetne&s;s aro&s;e from among the rocks; it &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng an air, who&s;e melancholy expre&s;&s;ions awakened all her attention, and captivated her heart. The tones &s;welled and died faintly away among the clear, yet langui&s;hing echoes, which the rocks repeated with an effect like that of enchantment. Madame looked a|round in &s;earch of the &s;weet warble, and ob&s;erved at &s;ome di&s;tance a pea&s;ant girl &s;eated on a &s;mall projec|tion of the rock, over&s;hadowed by drooping &s;ycamores. She moved &s;lowly towards the &s;pot, which &s;he had al|mo&s;t reached, when the &s;ound of her &s;teps &s;tartled and
<PB N="124" REF="029381_0123_0FE0D3F85C70B360">
&s;ilenced the &s;yren, who, on perceiving a &s;tranger, aro&s;e in an attitude to depart. The voice of Madame arre&s;t|ed her, and &s;he appproached. Language cannot paint the &s;en&s;ation of Madame, when, in the di&s;gui&s;e of a pea&s;ant girl, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the features of Julia, who&s;e eyes lighted up with &s;udden recollection, and who &s;unk into her arms overcome with joy. When their fir&s;t emotions were &s;ub&s;ided, and Julia had re|ceived an&s;wers to her inquiries concerning Ferdinand and Emilia, &s;he led Madame to the place of her con|cealment. This was a &s;olitary cottage, in a clo&s;e val|ley &s;urrounded by mountains who&s;e cliffs appeared wholly inacce&s;&s;ible to mortal foot. The deep &s;olitude of the &s;cene di&s;&s;ipated at once Madame's wonder that Julia had &s;o long remained undi&s;covered, and excited &s;urpri&s;e how &s;he had been able to explore a &s;pot thus deeply &s;eque&s;tered; but Madame ob&s;erved with ex|treme concern, that the countenance of Julia no lon|ger wore the &s;mile of health and gaiety. Her fine features had received the impre&s;&s;ions not only of me|lancholy, but of grief. Madame &s;ighed as &s;he gazed, and read too plainly the cau&s;e of the change. Julia under&s;tood that &s;igh, and an&s;wered it with her tears. She pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Madame in mournful &s;ilence to her lips, and her cheeks were &s;uffu&s;ed with a crim&s;on glow. At length, recovering her&s;elf, "I have much, my dear Madame, to tell," &s;aid &s;he, "and much to explain, 'ere you will admit me again to that e&s;teem of which I was once &s;o ju&s;tly proud. I had no re|&s;ource from mi&s;ery, but in flight; and of that I could not make you a confidant, without meanly involving you in its di&s;grace." "Say no more, my love, on the &s;ubject," replied Madame; "with re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I admired your conduct, and felt &s;everely for your &s;i|tuation. Rather let me hear by what means you ef|fected

your e&s;cape, and what has &s;ince befallen you." Julia pau&s;ed a moment, as if to &s;tifle her ri&s;ing emo|tion, and then commenced her narrative.</P>
<P>"You are already acquainted with the &s;ecret of that night, &s;o fatal to my peace. I recall the remembrance of it with an angui&s;h which I cannot conceal; and why &s;hould I wi&s;h its concealment, &s;ince I mourn for one, who&s;e noble qualities ju&s;tified all my admiration, and de&s;erved more than my feeble prai&s;e can be&s;tow: the idea of whom will be the la&s;t to linger in my mind till death &s;huts up this painful &s;cene." Her voice trembled, and &s;he pau&s;ed. After a few moments &s;he re&s;umed her tale. "I will &s;pare my&s;elf the pain of recurring to &s;cenes with which you are not unac|quainted, and proceed to tho&s;e which more immedi|ately attract your intere&s;t. Caterina, my faithful &s;er|vant, you know, attended me in my confinement; to her kindne&s;s I owe my e&s;cape. She obtained from her lover, a &s;ervant in the ca&s;tle, that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which gave me liberty.&mdash;One night when Carlo, who had been ap|pointed my guard, was a&s;leep, Nicolo crept into his chamber, and &s;tole from him the keys of my pri&s;on. He had previou&s;ly procured a ladder of ropes. O! I can never forget my emotions, when in the dead hour of that night, which was meant to precede the day of my &s;acrifice, I heard the door of my pri&s;on unlock, and found my&s;elf half at liberty! My trembling limbs with difficulty &s;upported me as I followed Caterina to the &s;aloon, the windows of which being low and near to the terrace, &s;uited our purpo&s;e. To the terrace we ea&s;ily got, where Nicolo awaited us with the rope lad|der. He fa&s;tened it to the ground; and having climbed to the top of the parapet, quickly &s;lided down on the other &s;ide. There he held it while we a&s;cend|ed and de&s;cended; and I &s;oon breathed the air of
<PB N="126" REF="029381_0125_0FE0D404748459E8">
freedom again. But the apprehen&s;ion of being re|taken was &s;till too powerful to permit a full enjoyment of my e&s;cape. It was my plan to proceed to the place of my faithful Caterina's nativity, where &s;he had a&s;|&s;ured me I might find a &s;afe a&s;ylum in the cottage of her parents, from whom, as they had never &s;een me, I might conceal my birth. This place, &s;he &s;aid, was en|tirely unknown to the marquis, who had hired her at Naples only a few months before, without any inquir|ies concerning her family. She had informed me that the village was many leagues di&s;tant from the ca&s;tle, but that &s;he was very well acquainted with the road. At the foot of the walls we left Nicolo, who returned to the ca&s;tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prevent &s;u&s;picion, but with an intention to lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it at a le&s;s dangerous time, and repair to Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|rini to his good Caterina.

<P>"ABOUT a quarter of a league from the walls we &s;topped, and I a&s;&s;umed the habit in which you now &s;ee me. My own dre&s;s was fa&s;tened to &s;ome heavy &s;tones, and Caterina threw it into the &s;tream, who&s;e murmurings you have &s;o often admired. The fatigue and hard&s;hip I endured in this journey, performed al|mo&s;t wholly on foot, at any other time would have overcome me; but my mind was &s;o occupied by the danger I was avoiding, that the&s;e le&s;&s;er evils were di&s;|regarded. We arrived in &s;afety at the cottage, which &s;tood at a little di&s;tance from the village of Farrini and
<PB N="127" REF="029381_0126_0FE0D40B56A272E8">
were received by Caterina's parents, with &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;e, and more kindne&s;s. I &s;oon perceived it would be u&s;ele&s;s, and even dangerous, to attempt to pre&s;erve the character I per&s;onated. In the eyes of Caterina's mother, I read a degree of &s;urpri&s;e and admiration which declared &s;he believed me of &s;uperior rank; I, therefore, thought it more prudent to win her fidelity by entru&s;ting her with my &s;ecret than, by endeavour|ing to conceal it, leave it to be di&s;covered by her curi|o&s;ity or di&s;cernment. Accordingly I made known my quality and my di&s;tre&s;s, and received &s;trong a&s;&s;urances of a&s;&s;i&s;tance and attachment. For further &s;ecurity I removed to this un&s;u&s;picious &s;pot. The cottage we are now in belongs to a &s;i&s;ter of Caterina <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who&s;e faithfulne&s;s I have been hitherto fully ju&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rely|ing.

<P>Here Julia clo&s;ed her narration, to which Madame had li&s;tened with a mixture of &s;urpri&s;e and pity, which her eyes &s;ufficiently di&s;covered. The la&s;t circum|&s;tance of the narrative &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed her. She acquainted Julia with the pur&s;uit which the duke had undertaken; and &s;he did not he&s;itate to believe it a party of his people whom Julia had de&s;cribed. Ma|dame, therefore, earne&s;tly advi&s;ed her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> quit her pre|&s;ent &s;ituation, and to accompany her in di&s;gui&s;e to the mona&s;tery of St. Augu&s;tin, where &s;he would find a &s;e|cure retreat; becau&s;e, even if her place of refuge &s;hould be di&s;covered, the &s;uperior authority of the church would protect her. Julia accepted the propo|&s;al with much joy. As it was nece&s;&s;ary that Madame &s;hould &s;leep at the village where &s;he had left her &s;er|vants and hor&s;es, it was agreed that at break of day &s;he
<PB N="128" REF="029381_0127_0FE0D41084261E58">
&s;hould return to the cottage, where Julia would await her. Madame took an affectionate leave of Julia who&s;e heart, in &s;pite of rea&s;on &s;unk when &s;he &s;aw her depart though but for the nece&s;&s;ary interval of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>At the dawn of day Madame aro&s;e. Her &s;ervants, who were hired for the journey were &s;trangers to Julia, from them, therefore, &s;he had nothing to apprehend. She reached the cottage before &s;un-ri&s;e, having left her people at &s;ome little di&s;tance. Her heart fore|boded evil, when, on knocking at the door, no an&s;wer was returned. She knocked again, and &s;till all was &s;i|lent. Through the ca&s;ement &s;he could di&s;cover no ob|ject, amid&s;t the grey ob&s;curity of the dawn. She now opened the door, and to her inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;toni&s;h|ment and di&s;tre&s;s, found the cottage empty. She pro|ceeded to a &s;mall inner room, where lay a part of Julia's apparel. The bed had no appearance of being &s;lept in, and every moment &s;erved to heighten and confirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her apprehen&s;ions. While &s;he pur&s;ued the &s;earch, &s;he &s;uddenly heard the trampling of feet at the cottage door, and pre&s;ently after &s;ome people entered.&mdash;Her fears for Julia now yielded to tho&s;e for her own &s;afety, and &s;he was undetermined whether to di&s;cover her&s;elf, or remain in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, when &s;he was re|lieved from her irre&s;olution and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;s by the appear|ance of Julia.</P>
<P>On the return of the good woman, who had accom|companied Madame to the village on the preceding night, Julia went to the cottage at Farrini. Her grateful heart would not &s;uffer her to depart without taking leave of her faithful friends, thanking them for their kindne&s;s, and informing them of her future pro|&s;pects. They had prevailed upon her to &s;pend the few intervening hours at this cot, whence &s;he had ju&s;t ri&s;en to meet Madame.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="029381_0128_0FE0D41856F5DE60">They now ha&s;tened to the &s;pot where the hor&s;es were &s;tationed, and commenced their journey. For &s;ome leagues they travelled in &s;ilence and thought, over a wild and picture&s;que country. The land&s;cape was tinted with rich and vari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated hues; and the au|tumnal lights, which &s;treamed upon the hills, produced a &s;pirited and beautiful effect upon the &s;cenery. All the glories of the vintage ro&s;e to their view: the pur|ple grapes flu&s;hed through the dark green of the &s;ur|rounding foliage, and the pro&s;pect glowed with warm luxuriance.</P>
<P>They now de&s;cended into a deep valley, which ap|peared more like a &s;cene of airy enchantment than re|ality. Along the bottom flowed a clear maje&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tream, who&s;e ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ks were adorned with thick groves of orange and citron trees. Julia &s;urveyed the &s;cene in &s;ilent complacency, but her eye quickly caught an ob|ject which changed with in&s;tantaneous &s;hock the tone of her feelings. She ob&s;erved a party of hor&s;emen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inding down the &s;ide of a hill behind them. Their uncommon &s;peed alarmed her and &s;he pu&s;hed her hor&s;e into a gallop. On looking back they clearly perceiv|ed them&s;elves to be pur&s;ued. Soon after the men &s;ud|denly appeared from behind a dark grove within a &s;mall di&s;tance of them; and upon their nearer ap|proach, Julia overcome with fatigue and fear, &s;unk breathle&s;s from her hor&s;e. She was &s;aved from the ground by one of the pur&s;uers, who caught her in his arms. Madame, with the re&s;t of the party, were quickly overtaken; and as &s;oon as Julia revived, they were bound, and re-conducted to the hill from whence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey had de&s;cended.

After travelling for &s;ome hours, they quitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he main road, and turned into a narrow winding dell, over&s;hadowed by high trees, which al|mo&s;t excluded the light. The gloom of the place in|&s;pired terrific images.

Madame wept over her, but comfort &s;he had none to give. The day clo&s;ed&mdash;the duke did not appear, and the fate of Julia yet hung in perilous uncertainty. At length, from a window of the apartment &s;he was in, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed a glimmering of torches among the trees, and pre&s;ently after the clattering of hoofs convinced her the duke was approaching. Her heart &s;unk at the &s;ound; and throwing her arms round Madame's neck, &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to de&s;pair. She was &s;oon rou&s;ed by &s;ome men, who came to announce the arrival of their lord.

Madame now &s;tepped forward, and an explanation en|&s;ued, when it appeared that the &s;tranger was the mar|quis Murani, the father of the fair fugitive whom the duke had before mi&s;taken for Julia.</P>
<P>The appearance and evident flight of Julia, had de|ceived the banditti employed by this nobleman, into a belief that &s;he was the object of their &s;earch, and had occa&s;ioned her this unnece&s;&s;ary di&s;tre&s;s. But the joy &s;he now felt on finding her&s;elf thus unexpectedly at li|berty, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, her preceding terrors.

<P>They aro&s;e with the dawn, and continued their journey, continually terrified with the apprehen&s;ion of encountering the duke's people. At noon they arriv|ed at Azulia, from whence the mona&s;tery, or abbey of St. Augu&s;tin was di&s;tant only a few miles.

She was received by the abbot with a &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of paternal affection, and by the nuns with officious kind|ne&s;s.

Comforted by the&s;e circum&s;tances, and by the tranquil appearance of every thing around her, &s;he re|tired to re&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in peaceful &s;lumbers.</P>
<P>In her pre&s;ent &s;ituation &s;he found much novelty to amu&s;e, and much &s;erious matter to engage her mind. Entendered by di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he ea&s;ily yielded to the pen|&s;ive manners of her companions, and to the &s;erene uni|formity of a mona&s;tic life. She loved to wander through the lonely cloi&s;ters, and high-arched ai&s;les, who&s;e long per&s;pectives retired in &s;imple grandeur, diffu&s;ing a holy calm around. She found much plea|&s;ure in the conver&s;ation of the nuns, many of whom were uncommonly amiable, and the dignified &s;weetne&s;s of who&s;e manners formed a charm irre&s;i&s;tibly attrac|tive. The &s;oft melancholy impre&s;&s;ed upon their coun|tenances, pourtrayed the &s;ituation of their minds, and excited in Julia a very intere&s;ting mixture of pity and e&s;teem. The affectionate appellation of &s;i&s;ter, and all that endearing tenderne&s;s which they &s;o well know how to di&s;play, and of which they &s;o well under&s;tand the effect, they be&s;towed on Julia, in the hope of win|ing her to become one of their order.</P>
<P>Soothed by the pre&s;ence of Madame, the a&s;&s;iduity of the nuns, and by the &s;tillne&s;s and &s;anctity of the place, her mind gradually recovered a degree of complacency to which it had long been a &s;tranger. But notwith|&s;tanding all her efforts, the idea of Hippolitus would at intervals return upon her memory with a force that at once &s;ubdued her fortitude, and &s;unk her in a tem|porary de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Among the holy &s;i&s;ters, Julia di&s;tingui&s;hed one, the &s;ingular fervor of who&s;e devotion, and the pen&s;ive air of who&s;e countenance, &s;oftened by the languor of ill|ne&s;s, attracted her curio&s;ity, and excited a &s;trong de|gree of pity.

particularly inclined towards Julia, which &s;he di&s;|covered by innumerable acts of kindne&s;s, &s;uch as the heart can quickly under&s;tand and acknowledge, al|though de&s;cription can never reach them. In conver|&s;ation with her, Julia endeavoured, as far as delicacy would permit, to prompt an explanation of that more than common dejection which &s;haded tho&s;e features, where beauty, touched by re&s;ignation and &s;ublimed by religion, &s;hone forth with mild and lambent lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The duke de Luovo, after having been detained for &s;ome weeks by the fever which his wounds had produ|ced, and his irritated pa&s;&s;ions had much prolonged, ar|rived at the ca&s;tle of Mazzini.

The con&s;equence might have been fatal, had not the ambition of the marquis &s;ubdued the &s;udden irritation of his inferior pa&s;&s;ions, and induced him to &s;often the &s;everity of his accu&s;ations, by &s;ub&s;equent conce&s;&s;ions. The duke, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for Julia was heightened by the difficul|ty, which oppo&s;ed it, admitted &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions, as in other circum&s;tances he would have rejected; and thus each conquered by the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of the mo|ment, &s;ubmitted to be the &s;lave of his adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>Emilia was at length relea&s;ed from the confinement &s;he had &s;o unju&s;tly &s;uffered. She had now the u&s;e of her old apartments, where, &s;olitary and dejected, her hours moved heavily along, embittered by ince&s;&s;ant anxiety for Julia, and by regret for the lo&s;t &s;ociety of Madame.

<P>The &s;earch after Julia &s;till continued, and was &s;till un&s;ucce&s;sful. The a&s;toni&s;hment of the marquis in|crea&s;ed with his di&s;appointments; for where could Julia, ignorant of the country, and de&s;titute of friends, have po&s;&s;ibly found an a&s;ylum? He &s;wore with a ter|rible oath to revenge on her head, whenever &s;he &s;hould be found, the trouble and vexation &s;he now cau&s;ed him.

<P>MEANWHILE Julia, &s;heltered in the ob&s;cure rece&s;&s;es of St. Augu&s;tin, endeavoured to attain a de|gree of that tranquillity which &s;o &s;trikingly characte|rized the &s;cenes around her.

It was founded in the twelfth

century, and &s;tood a proud monument of monki&s;h &s;u|per&s;tition and princely muni&s;icence. In the times when Italy was agitated by internal commotions, and per&s;ecuted by foreign invaders, this edifice afforded an a&s;ylum to many noble Italian emigrants, who here con|&s;ecrated the re&s;t of their days to religion. At their death they enriched the mona&s;tery with the trea&s;ures which it had enabled them to &s;ecure.</P>
<P>The view of this building revived in the mind of the beholder the memory of pa&s;t ages. The manners and characters which di&s;tingui&s;hed them aro&s;e to his fancy, and through the long lap&s;e of years, he di&s;criminated tho&s;e cu&s;toms and manners which formed &s;o &s;triking a contra&s;t to the modes of his own times. The rude manners, the boi&s;terous pa&s;&s;ions, the daring ambition, and the gro&s;s indulgences which formerly characterized the prie&s;t, the nobleman, and the &s;overeign, had then begun to yield to learning&mdash;the charms of refined con|ver&s;ation&mdash;political intrigue and private artifices. Thus do the &s;cenes of life vary with the predominant pa&s;&s;ions of mankind, and with the progre&s;s of civiliza|tion. The dark clouds of prejudice break away be|fore the &s;un of &s;cience, and gradually di&s;&s;olving, leave the brightening hemi&s;phere to the influence of his beams. But through the pre&s;ent &s;cene appeared only a few &s;cattered rays, which &s;erved to &s;how more forci|bly the va&s;t and heavy ma&s;&s;es that concealed the form of truth. Here prejudice, not rea&s;on, &s;u&s;pended the influence of the pa&s;&s;ions; and &s;chola&s;tic learning, my&s;|terious philo&s;ophy, and crafty &s;anctity, &s;upplied the place of wi&s;dom, &s;implicity, and pure devotion.</P>
<P>At the abbey, &s;olitude and &s;tillne&s;s, con&s;pired with the &s;olemn a&s;pect of the pile to impre&s;s the mind with religious awe. The dim gla&s;s of the high-arched win|dows, &s;tained with the colouring of monki&s;h fictions

Madame behaved to Julia with the ten|dere&s;t attention, and endeavoured to withdraw her thoughts from their mournful &s;ubject, by promoting that ta&s;te for literature and mu&s;ic, which was &s;o &s;uita|ble to the powers of her mind.</P>
<P>But an object &s;eriou&s;ly intere&s;ting now obtained that regard, which tho&s;e of mere amu&s;ement failed to at|tract. Her favourite nun, for whom her love and e&s;|teem daily increa&s;ed, &s;eemed declining under the pre&s;|&s;ure of a &s;ecret grief. Julia was deeply affected with her &s;ituation, and though &s;he was not empowered to admini&s;ter con&s;olation to her &s;orrows, &s;he endeavour|ed to mitigate the &s;ufferings of illne&s;s. She nur&s;ed her with unremitting care, and &s;eemed to &s;eize with avidity the temporary opportunity of e&s;caping from her&s;elf. The nun appeared perfectly reconciled to her fate, and exhibited during her illne&s;s, &s;o much &s;weet|ne&s;s, patience, and re&s;ignation, as affected all around her with pity and love. Her angelic mildne&s;s, and &s;teady fortitude, characterized the beatification of a &s;aint, rather than the death of a mortal. Julia watch|ed every turn of her di&s;order with the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude, and her care was at length rewarded by the amend|ment of Cornelia. Her health gradually improved, and &s;he attributed this circum&s;tance to the a&s;&s;iduity and tenderne&s;s of her young friend, to whom her heart now expanded in warm and unre&s;erved affection. At length Julia ventured to &s;olicit what &s;he had &s;o long and &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for, and Cornelia unfolded the hi&s;tory of her &s;orrows.</P>

<P>"I am the unfortunate de&s;cendant of an ancient and illu&s;trious Italian family.

He united in an eminent deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mild virtues of &s;ocial life, with the firm unbending qualities of the noble Romans, his ance&s;tors, from whom he was proud to trace his de&s;cent.

<P>"My father's fortune was un&s;uitable to his rank. That his &s;on might hereafter be enabled to &s;upport the dignity of his family, it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to a&s;&s;ume the veil. Alas! that heart was unfit to be offered at an heavenly &s;hrine, which was already devoted to an earthly object. My affections had long been engaged by the younger &s;on of a neighbouring nobleman, who&s;e character and accompli&s;hments attracted my early love, and confirmed my late&s;t e&s;teem. Our families were in|timate, and our youthful intercour&s;e occa&s;ioned an at|tachment, which &s;trengthened and expanded with our years. He &s;olicited me of my father, but there appear|ed an in&s;uperable barrier to our union.

Julia an&s;wered with her &s;ighs, and their tears flowed in mournful &s;ympathy together. At length Cornelia re&s;umed her narrative.</P>
<P>"My father, &s;truck with the conduct of Hippoli|tus, pau&s;ed upon the offer. The alteration in my health was too obvious to e&s;cape his notice; the con|flict between pride and parental tenderne&s;s, held him for &s;ome time in indeci&s;ion, but the latter finally &s;ub|dued every oppo&s;ing feeling, and he yielded his con|&s;ent to my marriage with Angelo. The &s;udden tran|&s;ition from grief to joy, was almo&s;t too much for my feeble frame; judge then what mu&s;t have been the ef|fect of the dreadful rever&s;e, when the news arrived that Angelo had fallen in a foreign engagement! Let me obliterate, if po&s;&s;ible, the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ations &s;o dreadful. The &s;ufferings of my brother, who&s;e ge|nerous heart could &s;o finely feel for another's woe, were on this occa&s;ion inferior only to my own.</P>
<P>"After the fir&s;t exce&s;s of my grief was &s;ub&s;ided, I de|&s;ired to retire from a world which, had tempted me

only with illu&s;ive vi&s;ions of happine&s;s, and to remove from tho&s;e &s;cenes which prompted recollection, and perpetuated my di&s;tre&s;s. My father applauded my re|&s;olution, and I immediately was admitted a noviciate into this mona&s;tery, with the Superior of which my father had in his youth been acquainted.</P>
<P>"At the expiration of the year I received the veil, Oh! I well remember with what perfect re&s;ignation, with what comfortable complacency I took tho&s;e vows which bound me to a life of retirement, and religious re&s;t.</P>
<P>"The high importance of the moment, the &s;olemnity of the ceremony, the &s;acred gloome which &s;urrounded me, and the chilling &s;ilence that prevailed when I ut|tered the irrevocable vow&mdash;all con&s;pired to impre&s;s my imagination, and to rai&s;e my views to heaven. When I knelt at the altar, the &s;acred flame of pure devotion glowed in my heart, and elevated my &s;oul to &s;ublimity. The world and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its recollections ended from my mind, and left it to the influence of a &s;erene and holy enthu&s;ia&s;m which no words can de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>"Soon after my noviciation, I had the misfortune to lo&s;e my dear father. In the tranquility of this mo|na&s;tery, however, in the &s;oothing kindne&s;s of my com|panions, and in devotional exerci&s;es, my &s;orrows found relief, and the &s;ting of grief was blunted. My repo&s;e was of &s;hort continuance. A circum&s;tance occurred that renewed the mi&s;ery, which can now never quit me but in the grave, &s;o which I look with no fearful ap|prehen&s;ion, but as a refuge from calamity, tru&s;ting that the power who has &s;een good to afflict me, will par|don the imperfectne&s;s of my devotion, and the too frequent wandering of my thoughts to the objects once &s;o dear to me."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, which beamed with

<P>"One day, Oh! never &s;hall I forget it, I went as u&s;ual to the confe&s;&s;ional to acknowledge my &s;ins. I knelt before the father with eyes bent towards the earth, and in a low voice proceeded to confe&s;s. I had but one crime to deplore, and that was the too tender remembrance of him for whom I mourned, and who&s;e idea impre&s;&s;ed upon my heart, made it a blemi&s;hed of|fering to God.</P>
<P>"I was interrupted in my confe&s;&s;ion by a &s;ound of deep &s;obs, and rai&s;ing my eyes, Oh God, what were my &s;en&s;ations, when in the features of the holy father, I di&s;covered Angelo! His image faded like a vi&s;ion from my &s;ight, and I &s;unk at his feet. On recovering I found my&s;elf on my matra&s;s attended by a &s;i&s;ter, who I di&s;covered by her conver&s;ation had no &s;u&s;picion of the occa&s;ion of my di&s;order. Indi&s;po&s;ition confined me to my bed for &s;everal days; when I recovered, I &s;aw Angelo no more, and could almo&s;t have doubted my &s;en&s;es, and believed that an illu&s;ion had cro&s;&s;ed my &s;ight, till one day I found in my cell a written paper. I di&s;tingui&s;hed at the fir&s;t glance the hand writing of Angelo, that well known hand which had &s;o often a|wakened me to other emotions. I trembled at the &s;ight; my beating heart acknowledged the beloved characters; a cold tremor &s;hook my frame, and half breathle&s;s I &s;eized the paper. But recollecting my|&s;elf, I pau&s;ed&mdash;I he&s;itated: duty at length yielded to the &s;trong temptation, and I read the lines. Oh! tho&s;e lines! prompted by de&s;pair, and bathed in my tears! every word they offered gave a new pang to my heart, and &s;welled its angui&s;h almo&s;t beyond endurance. I learned that Angelo, &s;everely wounded in a foreign

engagement, had been left for dead upon the field I that his life was &s;aved by the humanity of a common &s;oldier of the enemy, who perceiving &s;igns of exi&s;tence conveyed him to a hou&s;e. A&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;oon pro|cured, but his wounds exhibited the mo&s;t alarming &s;ymptoms. During &s;everal months he langui&s;hed be|tween life and death, till at length his youth and con|&s;titution &s;urmounted the conflict, and he returned to Naples. Here he &s;aw my brother, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;s and a&s;toni&s;hment at beholding him occa&s;ioned a relation of pa&s;t circum&s;tances, and of the vows I had taken in con|&s;equence of the report of his death. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to mention the immediate effect of this narration; the final one exhibited a very &s;ingular proof of his attach|ment and de&s;pair;&mdash;he devoted him&s;elf to a mona&s;tie life, and cho&s;e this abbey for the place of his re&s;idence, becau&s;e it contained the object mo&s;t dear to his affec|tions. His letter informed me that he had purpo&s;ely avoided di&s;covering him&s;elf, endeavouring to be con|tented with the opportunities which occurred of &s;ilent|ly ob&s;erving me, till chance had occa&s;ioned the fore|going interview.&mdash;But that &s;ince its effects had been &s;o mutually painful, he would relieve me from the ap|prehen&s;ion of a &s;imilar di&s;tre&s;s, by a&s;&s;uring me, that I &s;hould &s;ee him no more. He was faithful to his pro|mi&s;e; from that day I have never &s;een him, and an even ignorant whether he yet inhabits this a&s;ylum&punc; the efforts of religious fortitude, and the ju&s;t fear of exciting &s;urpri&s;e, having withheld me from inquiry. But the moment of our la&s;t interview has been equal|ly fatal to my peace and to my health, and I tru&s;t I &s;hall ere very long be relea&s;ed from the agonizing in|effectual &s;truggles occa&s;ioned by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;acred vows imperfectly performed, and by earthly af|fections not wholly &s;ubdued."</P>

<P>JULIA accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to walk in the fine even|ings under the &s;hade of the high trees that environed the abbey. The dewy coolne&s;s of the air refre&s;hed her. The innumerable ro&s;eat tints which the parting &s;un-beams reflected on the rocks above, and the fine vermeil glow diffu&s;ed over the romantic &s;cene beneath, &s;oftly fading from the eye, as the night-&s;hades fell, excited &s;en&s;ations of a &s;weet and tranquil nature, and &s;oothed her into a temporary forgetfulne&s;s of her &s;or|rows.</P>
<P>The deep &s;olitude of the place &s;ubdued her appre|hen&s;ion, and one evening &s;he ventured with Madame de Menon to lengthen her walk. They returned to
<PB N="146" REF="029381_0145_0FE0D483938E5CE8">
the abbey without having &s;een a human being, except a friar of the mona&s;tery, who had been to a neighbour|ing town to order provi&s;ion. On the following even|ing they repeated their walk; and engaged in conver|&s;ation, rambled to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the abbey. The di&s;tant bell of the mona&s;tery &s;ounding for ve&s;pers, reminded them of the hour, and looking round, they perceived the extremity of the wood. They were returning towards the abbey, when &s;truck by the appearance of &s;ome maje&s;tic columns which were di&s;tingui&s;hable between the trees, they pau&s;ed. Curio&s;ity tempted them to examine to what edifice pillars of &s;uch magnificent architecture could belong in a &s;cene &s;o rude, and they went on.</P>
<P>There appeared on a point of rock impending over the valley, the reliques of a palace, who&s;e beauty time had impaired only to heighten its &s;ublimity. An arch of &s;ingular magnificence remained almo&s;t entire, be|yond which appeared wild cliffs retiring in grand per|&s;pective. The &s;un, which was now &s;etting, threw a trembling lu&s;tre upon the ruins, and gave a fini&s;hing effect to the &s;cene. They gazed in mute wonder upon the view; but the fa&s;t fading light, and the dewy chill|ne&s;s of the air warned them to return. As Julia gave a la&s;t look to the &s;cene, &s;he perceived two men leaning upon a part of the ruin at &s;ome di&s;tance, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation. As they &s;poke, their looks were &s;o at|tentively bent on her, that &s;he could have no doubt &s;he was the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e. Alarmed at this circum&s;tance, Madame and Julia immediately retreat|ed towards the abbey. They walked &s;wiftly through the woods, who&s;e &s;hades, deepened by the gloom of evening, prevented their di&s;tingui&s;hing whether they were pur&s;ued. They were &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve the di&s;tance to which they had &s;trayed from the mona&s;te|ry,
<PB N="147" REF="029381_0146_0FE0D487C39E29A8">
who&s;e dark towers were now ob&s;curely &s;een ri&s;ing among the trees that clo&s;ed the per&s;pective. They had almo&s;t reached the gates, when on looking back, they perceived the &s;ame men &s;lowly advancing, with|out any appearance of pur&s;uit, but clearly as if ob&s;erv|ing the place of their retreat.</P>
<P>This incident occa&s;ioned Julia much alarm. She could not but believe that the men whom &s;he had &s;een were &s;pies of the marquis:&mdash;if &s;o, her a&s;ylum was di&s;covered, and &s;he had every thing to apprehend. Madame now judged it nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;afety of Julia, that the Abate &s;hould be informed of her &s;tory, and of the &s;anctuary &s;he had &s;ought in his mona&s;tery, and al|&s;o that he &s;hould be &s;olicited to protect her from pa|rental tyranny. This was a hazardous, but a nece&s;&s;a|ry &s;tep to provide again&s;t the certain danger which mu&s;t en&s;ue, &s;hould the marquis, if he demanded his daugh|ter of the Abate, be the fir&s;t to acquaint him with her &s;tory. If &s;he acted otherwi&s;e, &s;he feared that the Abate in who&s;e genero&s;ity &s;he had not confided, and who&s;e pity &s;he had not &s;olicited, would, in the pride of his re&s;entment, deliver her up, and thus would &s;he become a certain victim to the duke de Luovo.</P>
<P>Julia approved of this communication, though &s;he trembled for the event: and reque&s;ted Madame to plead her cau&s;e with the Abate. On the following morning, therefore, Madame &s;olicited a private audi|ence of the Abate; &s;he obtained permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee him, and Julia in trembling anxiety, watched her to the door of his apartment. The conference was long, and every moment &s;eemed an hour to Julia, who, in fearful expectation, awaited with Cornelia the &s;entence which would decide her de&s;tiny. She was now the con&s;tant companion of Cornelia, who&s;e declining,
<PB N="148" REF="029381_0147_0FE0D48E67AD70B0">
health intere&s;ted her pity, and &s;trengthened her at|tachment.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Madame developed to the Abate the di&s;|tre&s;sful &s;tory of Julia. She prai&s;ed her virtues, com|mended her accompli&s;hments, and deplored her &s;itua|tion. She de&s;cribed the characters of the marquis and the duke, and concluded with pathetically repre|&s;enting, that Julia had &s;ought in this mona&s;tery, a la&s;t a&s;ylum from inju&s;tice and mi&s;ery, and with entreating that the Abate would grant her his pity and pro|tection.</P>
<P>The Abate during this di&s;cour&s;e pre&s;erved a &s;ullen &s;ilence; his eyes were bent to the ground, and his a&s;|pect was thoughtful and &s;olemn. When Madame cea&s;ed to &s;peak, a pau&s;e of pro&s;ound &s;ilence en&s;ued, and &s;he &s;at in anxious expectation. She endeavoured to anticipate in his countenance the an&s;wer preparing, but &s;he derived no comfort from thence. At length rai&s;ing his head, and awakening from his deep reverie, he told her that her reque&s;t required deliberation, and that the protection &s;he &s;olicited for Julia, might in|volve him in &s;erious con&s;equences, &s;ince from a cha|racter &s;o determined as the marquis's, much violence might rea&s;onably be expected. "Should his daugh|ter be refu&s;ed him," concluded the Abate, "he may even dare to violate the &s;anctuary."</P>
<P>Madame &s;hocked by the &s;tern indifference of this reply, was a moment &s;ilent. The Abate went on. "Whatever I &s;hall determine upon, the young lady has rea&s;on to rejoice that &s;he is admitted into this holy hou&s;e; for I will even now venture to a&s;&s;ure her, that if the marquis fails to demand her, &s;he &s;hall be permitted to remain in this &s;anctuary unmole&s;ted. You, Madam, will be &s;en&s;ible of this indulgence, and of the value of the &s;acrifice I make in granting it;
<PB N="149" REF="029381_0148_0FE0D4942DA424A0">
for in thus concealing a child from her parent, I en|courage her in di&s;obedience, and con&s;equently &s;acrifice my &s;en&s;e of duty, to what may be ju&s;tly called a weak humanity."</P>
<P>Madame li&s;tened to this pompous declamation in &s;ilent &s;orrow and indignation. She made another ef|fort to intere&s;t the Abate in favour of Julia, but he pre&s;erved his &s;tern inflexibility, and repeating that he would deliberate upon the matter, and acquaint her with the re&s;ult, he aro&s;e with great &s;olemnity, and quitted the room.</P>
<P>She now half repented of the confidence &s;he had re|po&s;ed in him, and of the pity &s;he had &s;olicited, &s;ince he di&s;covered a mind incapable of under&s;tanding the fir&s;t, and a temper inacce&s;&s;ible to the influence of the latter. With an heavy heart &s;he returned to Julia, who read in her countenance, at the moment &s;he enter|ed the room, news of no happy import. When Ma|dame related the particulars of the conference, Julia pre&s;aged from it only mi&s;ery, and giving her&s;elf up for lo&s;t&mdash;&s;he bur&s;t into tears. She &s;everely deplored the confidence &s;he had been induced to yield; for &s;he now &s;aw her&s;elf in the power of a man, &s;tern and unfeel|ing in his nature; and from whom, if he thought it fit to betray her, &s;he had no means of e&s;caping. But &s;he concealed the angui&s;h of her heart; and to con&s;ole Madame, affected to hope where &s;he could only de&s;|pair.</P>
<P>Several day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ap&s;ed, and no an&s;wer was returned from the Abate. Julia too well under&s;tood this &s;ilence.</P>
<P>One morning Cornelia entering her room with a di&s;turbed and impatient air, informed her that &s;ome emi&s;&s;aries from the marquis were then in the mona&s;tery,
<PB N="150" REF="029381_0149_0FE0D49905EBB388">
having inquired at the gate for the Abate, with whom, they &s;aid, they had bu&s;ine&s;s of importance to tran&s;act. The Abate had granted them immediate audience, and they were now in clo&s;e conference.</P>
<P>At this intelligence the &s;pirits of Julia for&s;ook her; &s;he trembled, grew pale, and &s;tood fixed in mute de&s;|pair. Madame, though &s;carcely le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, retain|ed a pre&s;ence of mind. She under&s;tood too ju&s;tly the character of the Superior, to doubt that he would he|&s;itate in delivering Julia to the hands of the marquis. On this moment, therefore, turned the cri&s;is of her fate!&mdash;this moment &s;he might e&s;cape&mdash;the next &s;he was a pri&s;oner. She therefore advi&s;ed Julia to &s;eize the in&s;tant, and fly from the mona&s;tery before the con|ference was concluded, when the gates would mo&s;t probably be clo&s;ed upon her, a&s;&s;uring her, at the &s;ame time, &s;he would accompany her in flight.</P>
<P>The generous conduct of Madame called tears of gratitude into the eyes of Julia, who now awoke from the &s;tate of &s;tupefaction which di&s;tre&s;s had cau&s;ed. But before &s;he could thank her faithful friend, a nun entered the room with a &s;ummons for Madame to at|tend the Abate immediately. The di&s;tre&s;s which this me&s;&s;age occa&s;ioned cannot ea&s;ily be conceived. Madame advi&s;ed Julia to e&s;cape while &s;he detained the Abate in conver&s;ation, as it was not probable that he had yet i&s;&s;ued orders for her detention. Leaving her to this attempt, with an a&s;&s;urance of following her from the abbey as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, Madame obeyed the &s;um|mons. The coolne&s;s of her fortitude for&s;ook her as &s;he approached the Abate's apartment, and &s;he be|came le&s;s certa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as to the occa&s;ion of this &s;ummons.</P>
<P>The Abate was alone. His countenance was pale with anger, and he was pacing the room with &s;low but agitated &s;teps. The &s;tern authority of his look
<PB N="151" REF="029381_0150_0FE0D4A1E5DAE718">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tartled her. "Read this letter," &s;aid he, &s;tretching forth his hand which held a letter, "and tell me what that mortal de&s;erves, who dares in&s;ult our holy order, and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our &s;acred prerogative at defiance," Madame di&s;tingui&s;hed the hand writing of the marquis, and the word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Superior threw h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r into the utmo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hment. She took the letter. It was dictated by that &s;pirit of proud vindictive rage, which &s;o &s;trongly marked the character of the marquis. Having di&s;|covered the retreat of Julia, and believing the mona&s;tery afforded her a willing &s;anctuary from his pur&s;uit, he accu&s;ed the Abate of encouraging his child in open re|bellion to his will. He loaded him and his &s;acred or|der with opprobrium, and threatened, if &s;he was not immediately re&s;igned to the emi&s;&s;aries in waiting, he would in per&s;on lead on a force which &s;hould compel the church to yield to the &s;uperior authority of the father.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the Abate was rou&s;ed by this menace; and Julia obtained from his pride, that protection which neither his principle nor his humanity would have granted. "The man &s;hall tremble," cried he, "who dares defy our power, or que&s;tion our &s;acred authority. The lady Julia is &s;afe. I will protect her from this proud invader of our rights, and teach him at lea&s;t to venerate the power he cannot conquer. I have di&s;|patched his emi&s;&s;aries with my an&s;wer."</P>
<P>The&s;e words &s;truck &s;udden joy upon the heart of Madame de Menon, but &s;he in&s;tantly recollected, that ere this time Julia had quitted the abbey, and thus the very precaution which was meant to en&s;ure her &s;afety, had probably precipitated her into the hand of her enemy. This thought changed her joy to angui&s;h; and &s;he was hurrying from the apartment in a &s;ort of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ild hope, that Julia might not yet be gone, when
<PB N="152" REF="029381_0151_0FE0D4A6847C1A10">
the &s;tern voice of the Abate arre&s;ted her. "Is it thus," cried he, "that you receive the knowledge of our generous re&s;olution to protect your friend? Does &s;uch conde&s;cending kindne&s;s merit no thanks&mdash;demand no gratitude?" Madame returned in an agony of fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, le&s;t one moment of delay might prove fatal to Julia, if happily &s;he had not yet quitted the mona&s;tery. She was con&s;cious of her deficiency in apparent gra|titude, and of the &s;trange appearance of her abrupt departure from the Abate, for which it was impo&s;&s;ible to apologize, without betraying the &s;ecret, which would kindle all his re&s;entment. Yet &s;ome atonement his pre&s;ent anger demanded, and the&s;e circum&s;tances cau&s;ed her a very painful embarra&s;&s;ment. She formed a ha&s;ty excu&s;e; and expre&s;&s;ing her &s;en&s;e of his good|ne&s;s, again attempted to retire, when the Abate frown|ing in deep re&s;entment, his features inflamed with pride, aro&s;e from his &s;eat. "Stay," &s;aid he, "whence this impatience to fly from the pre&s;ence of a benefac|tor!&mdash;If my genero&s;ity fail to excite gratitude, my re&s;entment &s;hall not fail to in&s;pire awe.&mdash;Since the lady Julia is in&s;en&s;ible of my conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;he is un|worthy of my protection, and I will re&s;ign her to the tyrant who demands her."</P>
<P>To this &s;peech, in which the offended pride of the Abate overcoming all &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, accu&s;ed and threatened to puni&s;h Julia for the fault of her friend, Madame li&s;tened in dreadful impatience. Every word that detained her &s;truck torture to her heart, but the concluding &s;entence occa&s;ioned new terror, and &s;he &s;tarted at its purpo&s;e. She fell at the feet of the Abate in an agony of grief. "Holy father," &s;aid &s;he, "puni&s;h not Julia for the offence which I only have committed; her heart will ble&s;s her generous

<P>"If this is true," &s;aid the Abate, "ari&s;e, and bid the lady Julia attend me." This command increa&s;ed the confu&s;ion of Madame, who had no doubt that her detention had proved fatal to Julia. At length &s;he was &s;uffered to depart, and to her infinite joy found Julia in her own room. Her intention of e&s;caping had yielded immediately after the departure of Ma|dame, to the fear of being di&s;covered by the marquis's people. This fear had been confirmed by the report of Cornelia, who informed her, that at that time &s;e|veral hor&s;emen were waiting at the gates for the return of their companions. This was a dreadful circum|&s;tance to Julia, who perceived it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to quit the mona&s;tery, without ru&s;hing upon certain de&s;truction. She was lamenting her de&s;tiny, when Madame recited the particulars of the late interview, and delivered the &s;ummons of the Abate.</P>
<P>They had now to dread the effect of that tender anxiety, which had excited his re&s;entment; and Julia &s;uddenly elated to joy by his fir&s;t determination, was as &s;uddenly &s;unk to de&s;pair by his la&s;t. She trembled with apprehen&s;ion of the common interview, though each moment of delay, which her fear &s;olicited, would by heightening the re&s;entment of the Abate, only in|crea&s;e the danger &s;he dreaded.</P>
<P>At length by a &s;trong effort &s;he reanimated her &s;pi|rits, and went to the Abate's clo&s;et to receive her &s;en|tence. He was &s;eated in his chair, and his frowning a&s;pect chilled her heart. "Daughter," &s;aid he, "you have been guilty of heinous crimes. You have dared to di&s;pute&mdash;nay, openly to rebel, again&s;t the lawful authority of your father. You have di&s;obeyed the
<PB N="154" REF="029381_0153_0FE0D4B213BB6440">
will of him who&s;e prerogative yields only to ours. You have que&s;tioned his right upon a point of all others the mo&s;t decided&mdash;the right of a father to di&s;|po&s;e of his child in marriage. You have even fled from his protection&mdash;and you have dared&mdash;in&s;idiou&s;ly, and meanly have dared, to &s;creen your di&s;obedience beneath this &s;acred roof. You have profaned our &s;anctuary with your crime. You have brought in&s;ult upon our &s;acred order, and have cau&s;ed bold and im|pious defiance of our high prerogative. What puni&s;h|ment is adequate to guilt like this?"</P>
<P>The father pau&s;ed&mdash;his eyes &s;ternly fixed on Julia, who pale and trembling, could &s;carcely &s;upport her|&s;elf, and who had no power to reply. "I will be merciful, and not ju&s;t," re&s;umed he,&mdash;"I will &s;often the puni&s;hment you de&s;erve, and will only deliver you to your father." At the&s;e dreadful words, Julia bur&s;ting into tears, &s;unk at the feet of the Abate, to whom &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes in &s;upplicating expre&s;&s;ion, but was unable to &s;peak. He &s;uffered her to remain in this po&s;ture. "Your duplicity," he re&s;umed, "is not the lea&s;t of your offences. Had you relied upon our genero&s;ity for forgivene&s;s and protection, an in|dulgence might have been granted;&mdash;but under di&s;|gui&s;e of virtue you concealed your crimes, and your nece&s;&s;ities were hid beneath the ma&s;k of devotion."</P>
<P>The&s;e fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions rou&s;ed in Julia the &s;pirit of indignant virtue; &s;he aro&s;e from her knees with an air of dignity, that &s;truck even the Abate. "Holy father," &s;aid &s;he, "my heart abhors the crime you mention, and di&s;claims all union with it. Whatever are my offences&mdash;from the &s;in of hypocri&s;y I am at lea&s;t free; and you will pardon me if I remind you, that my confidence has already been &s;uch, as fully

ju&s;tifies my claim to the protection I &s;olicit. When I &s;heltered my&s;elf within the&s;e walls, it was to be pre|&s;umed that they would protect me from inju&s;tice; and with what other term than inju&s;tice would you, Sir, di&s;tingui&s;h the conduct of the marquis, if the fear of his power did not overcome the dictates of truth?"</P>
<P>The Abate felt the full force of this reproof; but di&s;daining to appear &s;en&s;ible to it, re&s;trained his re&s;ent|ment. His wounded pride thus exa&s;perated, and all the malignant pa&s;&s;ions of his nature thus called into action, he was prompted to that cruel &s;urrender which he had never before &s;eriou&s;ly intended. The offence which Madame de Menon had unintentionally given, his haughty &s;pirit urged him to retaliate in puni&s;hment. He had, therefore, plea&s;ed him&s;elf with exciting a terror which he never meant to confirm, and he re|&s;olved to be further &s;olicited for that protection which he had already determined to grant. But this re|proof of Julia touched him where he was mo&s;t con|&s;cious of defect; and the temporary triumph which he imagined it afforded her, kindled his re&s;entment into flame. He mu&s;ed in his chair, in a fixed atti|tude.&mdash;She &s;aw in his countenance the deep workings of his mind&mdash;&s;he revolved the fate preparing for her, and &s;tood in trembling anxiety to receive her &s;entence. The Abate con&s;idered each aggravating circum&s;tance of the marquis's menace, and each &s;entence of Julia's &s;peech; and his mind experienced, that vice is not only incon&s;i&s;tent with virtue, but with it&s;elf&mdash;for to gratify his malignity, he now di&s;covered that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;acrifice his pride&mdash;&s;ince it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to puni&s;h the object of the fir&s;t, without deny|ing him&s;elf the gratification of the former. This

reflexion &s;u&s;pended his mind in a &s;tate of torture, and he &s;at wrapt in gloomy &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit which lately animated Julia, had vani&s;hed with her words&mdash;each moment of &s;ilence increa&s;ed her apprehen&s;ion; the deep brooding of his thoughts con|firmed her in the apprehen&s;ion of evil, and with all the artle&s;s eloquence of &s;orrow, &s;he endeavoured to &s;often him to pity. He li&s;tened to her pleadings in &s;ullen &s;tillne&s;s. But each in&s;tant now cooled the fer|vour of his re&s;entment to her, and increa&s;ed his de&s;ire of oppo&s;ing the marquis. At length the predominant feature of his character re&s;umed its original influence, and overcame the workings of &s;ubordinate pa&s;&s;ion. Proud of his religious authority, he determined never to yield the prerogative of the church to that of the father, and re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the violence of the mar|quis with equal force.</P>
<P>He therefore conde&s;cended to relieve Julia from her terrors, by a&s;&s;uring her of his protection: but he did this in a manner &s;o ungracious, as almo&s;t to de&s;troy the gratitude which the promi&s;e demanded. She ha&s;tened with the joyful intelligence to Madame de Menon, who wept over her, tears of thankfulne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>NEAR a fortnight had elap&s;ed without producing an appearance of ho&s;tility from the marquis, when one night, long after the hour of repo&s;e, Julia was awakened by the bell of the mona&s;tery. She knew it was not the hour cu&s;tomary for prayer, and &s;he li&s;tened to the &s;ounds, which rolled through the deep &s;ilence of the fabric, with &s;trong &s;urpri&s;e and terror. Pre&s;ently
<PB N="157" REF="029381_0156_0FE0D4C40AB3D288">
&s;he heard the doors of &s;everal cells creak on their hinges, and the &s;ound of quick foot-&s;teps in the pa&s;|&s;ages&mdash;and through the crevices of her door &s;he di&s;|tingui&s;hed pa&s;&s;ing lights. The whi&s;pering noi&s;e of &s;teps encrea&s;ed, and every per&s;on of the mona&s;tery &s;eemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> awakened. Her terror heightened; it occurred to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er that the marquis had &s;urrounded the abbey with his people, in the de&s;ign of forcing her from her retreat; and &s;he aro&s;e in ha&s;te, with an inten|tion of going to the chamber of Madame de Menon, when &s;he heard a gentle tap at the door. Her in|quiry of who was there, was an&s;wered in the voice of Madame, and her fears were quickly di&s;&s;ipated, for &s;he learned the bell was a &s;ummons to attend a dying nun, who was going to the high altar, there to receive ex|treme unction.</P>
<P>She quitted the chamber with Madame. In her way to the church, the gleam of tapers on the walls, and the glimp&s;e which her eye often caught of the friars in their long black habits, de&s;cending &s;ilently through the narrow winding pa&s;&s;ages, with the &s;olemn toll of the bell, con&s;pired to kindle imagination, and to im|pre&s;s her heart with &s;acred awe. But the church ex|hibited a &s;cene of &s;olemnity, &s;uch as &s;he had never before witne&s;&s;ed. Its gloomy ai&s;les were imperfectly &s;een by the rays of tapers from the high altar, which &s;hed a &s;olitary gleam over the remote parts of the fabric, and produced large ma&s;&s;es of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght and &s;hade, &s;triking and &s;ublime in their effect.</P>
<P>While &s;he gazed, &s;he heard a di&s;tant chanting ri&s;e through the ai&s;les; the &s;ounds &s;welled in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> murmurs on the ear, and drew nearer and nearer, till a &s;udden blaze of light i&s;&s;ued from one of the portals, and the proce&s;&s;ion entered. The organ in&s;tantly founded a high
<PB N="158" REF="029381_0157_0FE0D4C8A6A36350">
and &s;olemn peal, and the voices ri&s;ing altogether, &s;welled the &s;acred &s;train. In front appeared the <HI>Padre Abate,</HI> with &s;low and mea&s;ured &s;teps, bearing the holy cro&s;s. Immediately followed a litter, on which lay the dying per&s;on covered with a white veil, borne along, and &s;urrounded by nuns veiled in white, each carrying in her hand a lighted taper. La&s;t came the friars, two and two, clothed in black, and each bearing a light.</P>
<P>When they reached the high altar the bier was re&s;ted, and in a few moments the anthem cea&s;ed. The Abate now approached to perform the unction; the veil of the dying nun was lifted&mdash;and Julia di&s;covered her beloved Cornelia! Her countenance was already im|pre&s;&s;ed with the image of death, but her eyes bright|ened with a faint gleam of recollection, when they fixed upon Julia, who felt a cold thrill run through her frame, and leaned for &s;upport on Madame. Julia now for the fir&s;t time di&s;tingui&s;hed the unhappy lover of Cornelia, on who&s;e features was depictured the an|gui&s;h of his heart, and who hung pale and &s;ilent over the bier. The ceremony being fini&s;hed, the anthem &s;truck up; the bier was lifted, when Cornelia faintly moved her hand, and it was again re&s;ted upon the &s;teps of the altar. In a few minutes the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed; when lifting her heavy eyes to her lover, with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of ineffable tenderne&s;s and grief, &s;he attempted to &s;peak, but the &s;ounds died on her clo&s;ing lips. A faint &s;mile pa&s;&s;ed over her countenance, and was &s;uc|ceeded by a fine devotional glow; &s;he folded her hands upon her bo&s;om, and with a look of meek re&s;ignation, rai&s;ing towards heaven her eyes, in which now &s;unk the la&s;t &s;parkles of expiring life&mdash;her &s;oul departed in a &s;hort deep &s;igh.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="029381_0158_0FE0D4CF2EE3E030">Her lover &s;inking back, endeavoured to conceal his emotions, but the deep &s;obs which agitated his brea&s;t, betrayed his angui&s;h, and the tears of every &s;pectator bedewed the &s;acred &s;pot where beauty, &s;en&s;e, and in|nocence expired.</P>
<P>The organ now &s;welled in mournful harmony; and the voices of the a&s;&s;embly chanted in choral &s;train, a low and &s;olemn requiem to the &s;pirit of the departed.</P>
<P>Madame hurried Julia, who was almo&s;t as lifele&s;s as her departed friend, from the church. A death &s;o &s;udden, heightened the grief which &s;eparation would otherwi&s;e have occa&s;ioned. It was the nature of Cor|nelia's di&s;order, to wear a changeful but flattering a&s;|pect. Though &s;he had long been declining, her decay was &s;o gradual and imperceptible, as to lull the appre|hen&s;ion of her friends into &s;ecurity. It was otherwi&s;e with her&s;elf; &s;he was con&s;cious of the change, but for|bore to afflict them with the knowledge of the truth. The hour of her di&s;&s;olution was &s;udden, even to her|&s;elf; but it was compo&s;ed, and even happy. In the death of Cornelia, Julia &s;eemed to mourn again tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Hippolitus. Her decea&s;e appeared to di&s;&s;olve the la&s;t tie which connected her with his memory.</P>
<P>In one of the friars of the convent, Madame was &s;urpri&s;ed to find the father who had confe&s;&s;ed the dy|ing Vincent. His appearance revived the remem|brance of the &s;cene &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed at the ca&s;tle of Mazzini; and the la&s;t words of Vincent, combined with the circum&s;tances which had &s;ince occurred, re|newed all her curio&s;ity and a&s;toni&s;hment. But his ap|pearance excited more &s;en&s;ations than tho&s;e of wonder. She dreaded, le&s;t he &s;hould be corrupted by the mar|quis, to whom he was known, and thus be induced to u&s;e his intere&s;t with the <HI>Abate,</HI> for the re&s;toration of Julia.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="029381_0159_0FE0D4D49C69D1A8">From the walls of the mona&s;tery, Julia now never ventured to &s;tray. In the glooms of evening &s;he &s;ome|times &s;tole into the cloi&s;ters, and often lingered at the grave of Cornelia, where &s;he wept for Hippolitus, as well as for her friend. One evening, during ve&s;pers, the bell of the convent was &s;uddenly rang out; the <HI>Abate,</HI> who&s;e countenance expre&s;&s;ed at once a&s;toni&s;h|and di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;u&s;pended the &s;ervice, and quitted the altar. The whole congregation repaired to the hall, where they learned that a friar, retiring to the convent, had &s;een a troop of armed men advancing through the wood; and not doubting they were the people of the marquis, and were approaching with ho&s;tile intention, had thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give the alarm. The <HI>Abate</HI> a&s;cended a turret, and thence di&s;covered through the trees a glittering of arms, and in the &s;ucceeding moment a band of men i&s;&s;ued from a dark part of the wood, into a long avenue which immediately fronted the &s;pot where he &s;tood. The clattering of hoofs was now di&s;tinctly heard; and Julia, &s;inking with terror, di&s;tingui&s;hed the marquis heading the troop, which &s;oon after &s;eparating into two divi&s;ions, &s;urrounded the mona&s;tery. The gates were immediately &s;ecured; and the <HI>Abate,</HI> de&s;cending from the turret, a&s;&s;embled the friars in the hall, where his voice was &s;oon heard above every other part of the tumult. The terror of Julia made her utterly forgetful of the <HI>Padre</HI>'s promi&s;e, and &s;he wi&s;hed to fly for concealment to the deep ca|verns belonging to the mona&s;tery, which wound under the woods. Madame, who&s;e penetration furni&s;hed her with a ju&s;t knowledge of the <HI>Abate</HI>'s character, found|ed her &s;ecurity on his pride. She therefore di&s;&s;uaded Julia from attempting to tamper with the hone&s;ty of a &s;ervant who had the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eys of the vaults, and advi&s;ed her
<PB N="161" REF="029381_0160_0FE0D4DAFA821A88">
to rely entirely on the effort of the <HI>Abate</HI>'s re&s;entment towards the marquis. While Madame endeavoured to &s;ooth her to compo&s;ure, a me&s;&s;age from the <HI>Abate,</HI> required her immediate attendance. She obeyed, and he bade her follow him to a room which was directly over the gates of the mona&s;tery. From thence &s;he &s;aw her father, accompanied by the duke de Luovo; and as her heart died away at the &s;ight, the marquis called furiou&s;ly to the <HI>Abate</HI> to deliver her in&s;tantly into his hands, threatening, if &s;he was detained, to force the gates of the mona&s;tery. At this threat the counte|nance of the <HI>Abate</HI> grew dark; and leading Julia for|cibly to the window from which &s;he had &s;hrunk back, "Impious menacer!" &s;aid he, "eternal vengeance be upon thee! From this moment we expel thee from all the rights and communities of our church. Arrogant and daring as you are, your threats I defy." "Look here," &s;aid he, pointing to Julia, "and learn that you you are in my power; for if you dare to violate the&s;e &s;acred walls, I will proclaim aloud in the face of day, a &s;ecret which &s;hall make your heart's blood run cold; a &s;ecret which involves your honour, nay, your very exi&s;tence. Now triumph and exult in impious me|nace!" The marquis &s;tarted involuntarily at this &s;peech, and his features underwent a &s;udden change, but he endeavoured to recover him&s;elf, and to conceal his confu&s;ion. He he&s;itated for a few moments, uncer|tain how to act&mdash;to de&s;i&s;t from violence was to confe&s;s him&s;elf con&s;cious of the threatening &s;ecret&punc; yet he dreaded to inflame the re&s;entment of the <HI>Abate,</HI> who&s;e menaces his own heart too &s;urely &s;econded. At length &mdash;"All that you have uttered," &s;aid he, "I de&s;pi&s;e as the da&s;tardly &s;ubterfuge of monki&s;h cunning. Your new in&s;ults add to the de&s;ire of recovering my daughter,
<PB N="162" REF="029381_0161_0FE0D4E06A689528">
and that of puni&s;hing you; I would proceed to in&s;tant violence, but that would now be an imperfect revenge. I &s;hall therefore withdraw my forces, and appeal to a higher power. Thus &s;hall you be compelled at once to re&s;tore my daughter, and retract your &s;candalous impeachment of my honour." Saying this, he turned his hor&s;e from the gates, and his people following him, quickly withdrew, leaving the <HI>Abate</HI> exulting in con|que&s;t, and Julia lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment and doubtful joy. When &s;he recounted to Madame the particulars of the conference, &s;he dwelt with empha&s;is on the threats of the <HI>Abate;</HI> but Madame, though her amazement was heightened at every word, very well under&s;tood how the &s;ecret, whatever it was, had been obtained. The confe&s;&s;or of Vincent &s;he had already ob&s;erved in the mona&s;tery, and there was no doubt that he had di&s;clo&s;ed whatever could be collected from the dying words of Vincent. She knew, al&s;o, that the &s;ecret would never be publi&s;hed, unle&s;s as a puni&s;hment for immediate violence, it being one of the fir&s;t principles of a mona&s;tic duty, to ob&s;erve a religious &s;ecrecy upon all matters intru&s;ted to them in confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t tumult of Julia's emotions &s;ub&s;ided, the joy which the &s;udden departure of the marquis oc|ca&s;ioned, yielded to apprehen&s;ion. He had threatened to appeal to a higher power, who would compel the <HI>Abate</HI> to &s;urrender her. This menace excited a ju&s;t terror, and there remained no means of avoiding the tyranny of the marquis, but by quitting the mo|na&s;tery. She therefore reque&s;ted an audience of the <HI>Abate;</HI> and having repre&s;ented the danger of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;he intreated his permi&s;&s;ion to depart in que&s;t of a &s;afer retreat. The <HI>Abate,</HI> who well knew the marquis was wholly in his power, laughed at the repetition of his menaces, and
<PB N="163" REF="029381_0162_0FE0D4E648036FF8">
denied her reque&s;t, under pretence of his having now become re&s;pon&s;ible for her to the church. He bade her be comforted, and promi&s;ed her his protection; but his a&s;&s;urances were given in &s;o di&s;tant and haughty a manner, that Julia left him with fears, rather increa&s;|ed than &s;ubdued. In cro&s;&s;ing the hall, &s;he ob&s;erved a man ha&s;tily enter it from an oppo&s;ite door. He was not in the habit of the order, but was muffled up in a cloak, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h concealment. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed he rai&s;ed his head, and Julia di&s;covered&mdash;her father! He darted at her a look of vengeance; but, before &s;he had time even to think, as if &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, he covered his face, and ru&s;hed by her. Her trembling frame could &s;carcely &s;upport her to the a|partment of Madame, where &s;he &s;unk &s;peechle&s;s upon a chair, and the horror of her look alone &s;poke the agony of her mind. When &s;he was &s;omewhat recover|ed, &s;he related what &s;he had &s;een, and her conver&s;ation with the <HI>Abate.</HI> But Madame was lo&s;t in equal per|plexity with her&s;elf, when &s;he attempted to account for the marquis's appearance. Why, after his late daring menace, &s;hould he come &s;ecretly to vi&s;it the <HI>Abate,</HI> by who&s;e connivance alone he could have gained admi&s;|&s;ion to the mona&s;tery? And what could have influ|enced the <HI>Abate</HI> to &s;uch a conduct? The&s;e circum|&s;tances, though equally inexplicable, united to confirm a fear of treachery and &s;urrender. To e&s;cape from the abbey was now impracticable, for the gates were con|&s;tantly guarded; and even was it po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s them, certain detection awaited Julia without from the marquis's people, who were &s;tationed in the woods. Thus encompa&s;&s;ed with danger, &s;he could only await in the mona&s;tery the i&s;&s;ue of her de&s;tiny.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="029381_0163_0FE0D4ECB9268610">While &s;he was lamenting with Madame her unhap|py &s;tate, &s;he was &s;ummoned once more to attend the <HI>Abate.</HI> At this moment her &s;pirits entirely for&s;ook her; the cri&s;is of her fate &s;eemed arrived; for &s;he did not doubt that the <HI>Abate</HI> intended to &s;urrender her to the marquis, with whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he had negocia|ted the terms of accommodation. It was &s;ome time before &s;he could recover compo&s;ure &s;ufficient to obey the &s;ummons; and when &s;he did, every &s;tep that bore her towards the <HI>Abate</HI>'s room, increa&s;ed her dread. She pau&s;ed a moment at the door, 'ere &s;he had cour|age to open it; the idea of her father's immediate re|&s;entment aro&s;e to her mind, and &s;he was upon the point of retreating to her chamber, when a &s;udden &s;tep within, near the door, de&s;troyed her he&s;itation, and &s;he entered the clo&s;et. The marquis was not there, and her &s;pirits revived. The flu&s;h of triumph was diffu&s;ed over the features of the <HI>Abate,</HI> though a &s;hade of un|appea&s;ed re&s;entment yet remained vi&s;ible.

Julia li&s;tened with a mixture of grief and a&s;|toni&s;hment. "Without this conce&s;&s;ion on your part, I po&s;&s;e&s;s not the power, had I even the inclination, to protect you. If you a&s;&s;ume the veil, you are &s;afe with|in the pale of the church from temporal violence.

He cea&s;ed to &s;peak; but Julia, agitat|ed with the mo&s;t cruel di&s;tre&s;s, knew not what to reply. "We grant you three days to decide upon this matter," continued he, "at the expiration of which, the veil, or the duke de Luovo, awaits you." Julia quitted the clo&s;et in mute de&s;pair, and repaired to Madame, who could now &s;carcely offer her the humble benefit of con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the <HI>Abate</HI> exulted in &s;ucce&s;sful ven|geance, and the marquis &s;marted beneath the &s;tings of di&s;appointment. The menace of the former was too &s;eriou&s;ly alarming to &s;uffer the marquis to pro&s;ecute violent mea&s;ures; and he had therefore re&s;olved, by oppo&s;ing avarice to pride, to &s;oothe the power which he could not &s;ubdue. But he was unwilling to entru&s;t the <HI>Abate</HI> with a proof of his compliance and his fears, by offering a bribe in a letter, and preferred the more humiliating, but &s;afer method, of a private interview. His magnificent offers created a temporary he&s;itation in the mind of the <HI>Abate,</HI> who, &s;ecure of his advantage, &s;howed at fir&s;t no di&s;po&s;ition to be reconciled, and &s;uf|fered the marquis to depart in anxious uncertainty. After maturely deliberating upon the propo&s;als, the pride of the <HI>Abate</HI> &s;urmounted his avarice; and he determined to prevail upon Julia effectually to de&s;troy the hopes of the marquis, by con&s;ecrating her life to religion. Julia pa&s;&s;ed the night and the next day in a &s;tate of mental torture exceeding all de&s;cription. The gates of the mona&s;tery be&s;et with guards, and the woods &s;urrounded by the marquis's people, made e&s;|cape impo&s;&s;ible. From a marriage with the duke,
<PB N="166" REF="029381_0165_0FE0D4F6D91441F0">
who&s;e late conduct had confirmed the odious idea which his character had formerly impre&s;&s;ed, her heart recoiled in horror, and to be immured for life within the walls of a convent, was a fate little le&s;s dreadful. Yet &s;uch was the effect of that &s;acred love &s;he bore the memory of Hippolitus, and &s;uch her aver&s;ion to the duke, that &s;he &s;oon re&s;olved to adopt the veil. On the following evening &s;he informed the <HI>Abate</HI> of her determination. His heart &s;welled with &s;ecret joy; and even the natural &s;everity of his manner relaxed at the intelligence. He a&s;&s;ured her of his approbation and protection, with a degree of kindne&s;s which he had never before manife&s;ted, and told her the ceremony &s;hould be performed on the &s;econd day from the pre|&s;ent. Her emotion &s;carcely &s;uffered her to hear his la&s;t words. Now that her fate was fixed beyond recall, &s;he almo&s;t repented of her choice. Her fancy attached to it a horror not its own; and that evil, which, when offered to her deci&s;ion, &s;he had accepted with little he&s;itation, &s;he now pau&s;ed upon in dubious regret; &s;o apt we are to imagine that the calamity mo&s;t certain, is al&s;o the mo&s;t intolerable!</P>
<P>When the marquis read the an&s;wer of the <HI>Abate,</HI> all the baleful pa&s;&s;ions of his nature were rou&s;ed and in|flamed to a degree which bordered upon di&s;traction. In the fir&s;t impul&s;e of his rage, he would have forced the gates of the mona&s;tery, and defied the utmo&s;t ma|lice of his enemy. But a moment's reflexion revived his fear of the threatened &s;ecret, and he &s;aw that he was &s;till in the power of the Superior.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abate</HI> procured the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;pen&s;ation, and preparations were immediately begun for the ap|proaching ceremony. Julia watched the departure of tho&s;e moments which led to her fate with the calm
<PB N="167" REF="029381_0166_0FE0D4FD587E4380">
fortitude of de&s;pair. She had no means of e&s;caping from the coming evil, without expo&s;ing her&s;elf to a wor&s;e; &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;urveyed it therefore with a &s;teady eye, and no longer &s;hrunk from its approach.</P>
<P>On the morning preceding the day of her con&s;ecra|tion, &s;he was informed that a &s;tranger inquired for her at the grate. Her mind had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to the vici&s;&s;itudes of apprehen&s;ion, that fear was the e|motion which now occurred; &s;he &s;u&s;pected, yet &s;carce|ly knew why, that the marquis was below, and he&s;i|tated whether to de&s;cend. A little reflexion deter|mined her, and &s;he went to the parlour&mdash;where to her equal joy and &s;urpri&s;e &s;he beheld&mdash;Ferdinand!</P>
<P>During the ab&s;ence of the marquis from his ca&s;tle, Ferdinand, who had been informed of the di&s;covery of Julia, effected his e&s;cape from impri&s;onment and had ha&s;tened to the mona&s;tery in the de&s;ign of re&s;cuing her. He had pa&s;&s;ed the woods in di&s;gui&s;e, with much difficulty eluding the ob&s;ervation of the mar|quis's people, who were yet di&s;per&s;ed round the abbey. To the mona&s;tery, as he came alone, he had been ad|mitted without difficulty.</P>
<P>When he learned the conditions of the <HI>Abate</HI>'s pro|tection, and that the following day was appointed for the con&s;ecration of Julia, he was &s;hocked, and pau&s;ed in deliberation. A period &s;o &s;hort as was this inter|val, afforded little opportunity for contrivance, and le&s;s for he&s;itation. The night of the pre&s;ent day was the only time that remained for the attempt and execu|tion of a plan of e&s;cape, which if it then failed of &s;uc|ce&s;s, Julia would not only be condemned for life to the walls of the mona&s;tery, but would be &s;ubjected to what|ever puni&s;hment the &s;everity of the <HI>Abate,</HI> exa&s;perated by the detection, &s;hould think fit to inflict. The
<PB N="168" REF="029381_0167_0FE0D501EBE457E8">
danger was de&s;perate, but the occa&s;ion was de&s;perate al&s;o.</P>
<P>The nobly di&s;intere&s;ted conduct of her brother, &s;truck Julia with gratitude and admiration; but de&s;|pair of &s;ucce&s;s, made her now he&s;itate whether &s;he &s;hould accept his offer. She con&s;idered that his gene|ro&s;ity would mo&s;t probably involve him in de&s;truction with her&s;elf; and &s;he pau&s;ed in deep deliberation, when Ferdinand informed her of a circum&s;tance which, till now, he had purpo&s;ely concealed, and which at once di&s;&s;olved every doubt and every fear. "Hippoli|tus," &s;aid Ferdinand, "yet lives." "Lives!" re|peated Julia faintly,&mdash;"lives! Oh! tell me where &mdash;how."&mdash;Her breath refu&s;ed to aid her, and &s;he &s;unk in her chair, overcome with the &s;trong and various &s;en|&s;ations that pre&s;&s;ed upon her heart. Ferdinand, whom the grate with-held from a&s;&s;i&s;ting her, ob&s;erved her &s;i|tuation in extreme di&s;tre&s;s. When &s;he recovered, he informed her that a &s;ervant of Hippolitus, &s;ent no doubt by his lord to inquire concerning Julia, had been lately &s;een by one of the marquis's people in the neighbourhood of the ca&s;tle. From him it was known that the count de Vereza was living, but that his life had been de&s;paired of; and he was &s;till confined, by dangerous wounds, in an ob&s;cure town on the coa&s;t of Italy. The man had &s;teadily refu&s;ed to mention the place of his lord's abode. Learning that the marquis was then at the abbey of St. Augu&s;tin, whither he pur&s;ued his daughter, the man di&s;appeared from Maz|zini, and had not &s;ince been heard of.</P>
<P>It was enough for Julia to know that Hippolitus lived; her fears of detection, and her &s;cruples con|cerning Ferdinand, in&s;tantly vani&s;hed; &s;he thought only of e&s;cape&mdash;and the means which had lately ap|peared &s;o formidable&mdash;&s;o difficult in contrivance, and
<PB N="169" REF="029381_0168_0FE0D50857D10FA8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o dangerous in execution, now &s;eemed ea&s;y, certain, and almo&s;t accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>They con&s;ulted on the plan to be adopted; and agreed, that in attempting to bribe a &s;ervant of the mona&s;tery to their intere&s;t, they &s;hould incur a danger too eminent, yet it appeared &s;carcely practicable to &s;ucceed is their &s;cheme without ri&s;quing this. After much con&s;ideration, they determined to entru&s;t their &s;ecret to no per&s;on but to Madame. Ferdinand was to contrive to conceal him&s;elf to the dead of the night in the church, between which and the mona&s;tery were &s;everal doors of communication. When the inhabi|tants of the abbey were &s;unk in repo&s;e, Julia might without difficulty pa&s;s to the church, were Ferdinand awaiting her, they might perhaps e&s;cape either through an outer door of the fabric, or through a window, for which latter attempt Ferdinand was to provide ropes.</P>
<P>A couple of hor&s;es were to be &s;tationed among the rocks beyond the woods, to convey the fugitives to a &s;ea-port, whence they could ea&s;ily pa&s;s over to Italy. Having arranged this plan, they &s;eparated in the anxious hope of meeting on the en&s;uing night.</P>
<P>Madame warmly &s;ympathized with Julia in her pre|&s;ent expectations, and was now &s;omewhat relieved from the pre&s;&s;ure of that &s;elf-reproach, with which the con&s;ideration of having withdrawn Julia from a &s;ecure a&s;ylum, had long tormented her. In learning that Hippolitus lived, Julia experienced a &s;udden renova|tion of life and &s;pirits. From the languid &s;tupefac|tion which de&s;pair had occa&s;ioned, &s;he revived as from a dream, and her &s;en&s;ations re&s;embled tho&s;e of a per&s;on &s;uddenly awakened from a frightful vi&s;ion, who&s;e thoughts are yet ob&s;cured in the fear and uncertainty which the pa&s;&s;ing images have impre&s;&s;ed on his fancy. She emerged from de&s;pair; joy illumined her counte|nance;
<PB N="170" REF="029381_0169_0FE0D50E06DBC0A8">
yet &s;he doubted the reality of the &s;cene which now opened to her view. The hours rolled heavily along till the evening, when expectation gave way to fear, for &s;he was once more &s;ummoned by the <HI>Abate.</HI> He &s;ent for her to admini&s;ter the u&s;ual nece&s;&s;ary ex|hortation on the approaching &s;olemnity; and having detained her a con&s;iderable time in tedious and &s;evere di&s;cour&s;e, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with a formal benediction.</P>

<P>THE evening now &s;unk in darkne&s;s, and the hour was fa&s;t approaching which would decide the fate of Julia. Trembling anxiety now &s;ubdued every other &s;en&s;ation; and as the minutes pa&s;&s;ed, her fears en|crea&s;ed. At length &s;he heard the gates of the mo|na&s;tery fa&s;tened for the night; the bell rang the &s;ignal for repo&s;e; and the pa&s;&s;ing foot&s;teps of the nuns told her they were ha&s;tening to obey it. After &s;ome time, all was &s;ilent. Julia did not yet dare to venture forth; &s;he employed the pre&s;ent interval in intere&s;ting and affectionate conver&s;ation with Madame de Menon, to whom, notwith&s;tanding her &s;ituation, her heart bade a &s;orrowful adieu.</P>
<P>The clock &s;truck twelve, when &s;he aro&s;e to depart. Having embraced her faithful friend with tears of mingled grief and anxiety, &s;he took a lamp in her hand and with cautious, fearful &s;teps, de&s;cended through the long winding pa&s;&s;ages to a private door, which opened into the church of the mona&s;tery. The church was gloomy and de&s;olate; and the feeble rays of the lamp &s;he bore, gave only light enough to di&s;cover its chilling grandeur. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ilently along the
<PB N="171" REF="029381_0170_0FE0D51233F4C418">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;les, &s;he ca&s;t a look of anxious examination around&mdash; but Ferdinand was no where to be &s;een. She pau&s;ed in timid he&s;itation, fearful to penetrate the gloomy ob&s;curity which lay before her, yet dreading to return.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;tood examining the place, vainly looking for Ferdinand, yet fearing to call le&s;t her voice &s;hould betray her, a hollow groan aro&s;e from a part of the church very near her. It chilled her heart, and &s;he remained fixed to the &s;pot. She turned her eyes a little to the left, and &s;aw light appear through the chinks of a &s;epulchre at &s;ome di&s;tance. The groan was repeated&mdash;a low murmuring &s;ucceeded, and while &s;he yet gazed, an old man i&s;&s;ued from the vault with a lighted taper in his hand. Terror new &s;ubdued her, and &s;he uttered an involuntary &s;hriek. In the &s;uc|ceeding moment, a noi&s;e was heard in a remote part of the fabric; and Ferdinand ru&s;hing forth from his con|cealment, ran to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The old man, who appeared to be a friar, and who had been doing pe|nance at the monument of a &s;aint, now approached. His countenance expre&s;&s;ed a degree of &s;urpri&s;e and terror almo&s;t equal to that of Julia's, who now knew him to be the confe&s;&s;or of Vincent. Ferdinand &s;eized the father, and laying his hand upon his &s;word, threa|tened him with death if he did not in&s;tantly &s;wear to conceal for ever his knowledge of what he then &s;aw, and al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t them to e&s;cape from the abbey.</P>
<P>"Ungracious boy!" replied the father in a calm voice, "de&s;i&s;t from this language, nor add to the fol|lies of youth the crime of murdering, or terrifying a defencele&s;s old man. Your violence would urge me to become your enemy, did not previous inclination tempt me to be your friend. I pity the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the lady Julia, to whom I am no &s;tranger, and will cheerfully give her all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power."</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="029381_0171_0FE0D518D73A4618">At the&s;e words Julia revived, and Ferdinand, re|proved by the genero&s;ity of the father, and con&s;cious of his own inferiority, &s;hrunk back. "I have no words to thank you," &s;aid he, "or to entreat your pardon for the impetuo&s;ity of my conduct; your know|ledge of my &s;ituation mu&s;t plead my excu&s;e." "It does," replied the father, "but we have no time to lo&s;e;&mdash;follow me."</P>
<P>They followed him through the church to the cloi&s;ters, at the extremity of which was a &s;mall door, which the friar unlocked.&mdash;It opened upon the woods.</P>
<P>"This path," &s;aid he, "leads thro' an intricate part of the woods, to the rocks that ri&s;e on the right of the abbey; in their rece&s;&s;es you may &s;ecrete your&s;elves till you are prepared for a longer journey. But extingui&s;h your light; it may betray you to the marquis's people, who are di&s;per&s;ed about this &s;pot. Farewell! my chil|dren, and God's ble&s;&s;ing be upon ye."</P>
<P>Julia's tears declared her gratitude; &s;he had no time for words. They &s;tepped into the path, and the fa|ther clo&s;ed the door. They were now liberated from the mona&s;tery, but danger awaited them without, which it required all their caution to avoid. Ferdinand knew the path which the friar had pointed out, to be the &s;ame that led to the rocks where his hor&s;es were &s;tationed, and he pur&s;ued it with quick and &s;ilent &s;teps. Julia, who&s;e fears con&s;pired with the gloom of night to magnify and transform every object around her, imagined at each &s;tep that &s;he took, &s;he perceived the figures of men, and fancied every whi&s;per of the breeze the &s;ound of pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>They proceeded &s;wiftly, till Julia breathle&s;s and exhau&s;ted could go no farther. They had not re&s;ted many minutes, when they heard a ru&s;tling among the bu&s;hes at &s;ome di&s;tance, and &s;oon after di&s;tingui&s;hed a
<PB N="173" REF="029381_0172_0FE0D51D5A7C8480">
low &s;ound of voices. Ferdinand and Julia in&s;tantly renewed their flight, and thought they &s;till heard voices advance upon the wind. This thought was &s;oon confirmed, for the &s;ounds now gained fa&s;t upon them, and they di&s;tingui&s;hed words which &s;erved only to heighten their apprehen&s;ions when they reached the extremity of the woods. The moon, which was now up, &s;uddenly emerging from a dark cloud, di&s;covered to them &s;everal men in pur&s;uit; and al&s;o &s;howed to the pur&s;uers the cour&s;e of the fugitives. They endea|voured to gain the rocks where the hor&s;es were con|cealed, and which appeared in view. The&s;e they reached when the pur&s;uers had almo&s;t overtaken them &mdash;but their hor&s;es were gone! Their only remaining chance of e&s;cape was to fly into the deep rece&s;&s;es of the rock. They, therefore, entered a winding cave from whence branched &s;everal &s;ubterraneous avenues, at the extremity of one of which they &s;topped. The voices of men now vibrated in tremendous echoes through the various and &s;ecret caverns of the place, and the &s;ound of foot&s;teps &s;eemed fa&s;t approaching. Julia trembled with terror, and Ferdinand drew his &s;word, determined to protect her to the la&s;t. A con|fu&s;ed volley of voices now &s;ounded up that part of the cave where Ferdinand and Julia lay concealed. In a few moments the &s;teps of the pur&s;uers &s;uddenly took a different direction, and the &s;ounds &s;unk gradually away, and were heard no more. Ferdinand li&s;tened at|tentively for a con&s;iderable time, but the &s;tillne&s;s of the place remained undi&s;turbed. It was now evident that the men had quitted the rock, and he ventured forth to the mouth of the cave. He &s;urveyed the wilds around as far as his eye could penetrate, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed no human being; but in the pau&s;es of the wind he &s;till thought he heard a &s;ound of di&s;tant
<PB N="174" REF="029381_0173_0FE0D5231D7EC418">
voices. As he li&s;tened in anxious &s;ilence, his eye caught the appearance of a &s;hadow, which moved upon the ground near where he &s;tood. He &s;tarted back within the cave, but in a few minutes again ventured forth. The &s;hadow remained &s;tationary; but having watched it for &s;ome time, Ferdinand &s;aw it glide along till it di&s;appeared behind a point of rock. He had now no doubt that the cave was watched, and that it was one of his late pur&s;uers who&s;e &s;hade he had &s;een. He returned, therefore, to Julia, and remained near an hour hid in the deepe&s;t rece&s;s of the rock; when, no &s;ound having interrupted the profound &s;ilence of the place, he at length once more ventured to the mouth of the cave. Again be threw a fearful look around, but di&s;cerned no human form. The &s;oft moon-beam &s;tept upon the dewy land&s;cape, and the &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s of midnight wrapt the world. Fear heightened to the fugitives the &s;ublimity of the hour. Ferdinand now led Julia forth, and they pa&s;&s;ed &s;ilently along the &s;helving foot of the rocks.</P>
<P>They continued their way without farther inter|ruption; and among the cliffs at &s;ome di&s;tance from the cave, di&s;covered to their inexpre&s;&s;ible joy their hor&s;es, who having broken their fa&s;tenings, had &s;trayed thither, and had now laid them&s;elves down to re&s;t. Ferdinand and Julia immediately mounted; and de&s;|cending to the plains, took the road that led to a &s;mall-&s;ea port at &s;ome leagues di&s;tance, whence they could embark for Italy.</P>
<P>They travelled for &s;ome hours through gloomy fore&s;ts of beech and che&s;nut; and their way was only faintly illuminated by the moon, which &s;hed a trem|bling lu&s;tre through the dark foliage, and which was &s;een but at intervals, as the pa&s;&s;ing clouds yielded to the power of her rays. They reached at length the
<PB N="175" REF="029381_0174_0FE0D52A97AEED60">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kirts of the fore&s;t. The grey dawn now appeared, and the chill morning air bit &s;hrewdly. It was with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy that Julia ob&s;erved the kindling at|mo&s;phere; and &s;oon after the rays of the ri&s;ing &s;un touching the tops of the mountains, who&s;e &s;ides were yet involved in dark vapours.</P>
<P>Her fears di&s;&s;ipated with the darkne&s;s. The &s;un now appeared amid clouds of inconceivable &s;plendour; and unveiled a &s;cene which in other circum&s;tances Julia would have contemplated with rapture. From the &s;ide of the hill, down which they were winding, a vale appeared, from whence aro&s;e wild and lofty mountains, who&s;e &s;ides were cloathed with hanging woods, except where here and there a precipice projected its bold and rugged front. Here a few half withered trees hung from the crevices of the rock, and gave a picture&s;que wildne&s;s to the object; there clu&s;ters of half &s;een cot|tages, ri&s;ing from among tufted groves, embelli&s;hed the green margin of a &s;tream which meandered in the bottom, and bore its waves to the blue and di&s;tant mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</P>
<P>The fre&s;hne&s;s of morning breathed over the &s;cene, and vivified each colour of the land&s;cape. The bright dew drops hung trembling from the branches of the trees, which at intervals ove&s;hadowed the road; and the &s;prightly mu&s;ic of the birds &s;aluted the ri&s;ing day. Notwith&s;tanding her anxiety, the &s;cene diffu&s;ed a &s;oft complacency over the mind of Julia.</P>
<P>About noon they reached the port, where Ferdinand was fortunate enough to obtain a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el; but the wind was unfavourable, and it was pa&s;t midnight be|fore it was po&s;&s;ible for them to embark.</P>
<P>When the dawn appeared, Julia returned to the deck; and viewed with a &s;igh of unaccountable regret, the receding coa&s;t of Sicily. But &s;he ob&s;erved with high admiration, the light gradually &s;preading through
<PB N="176" REF="029381_0175_0FE0D52F2C2C9800">
the atmo&s;phere, darting a feeble ray over the &s;urface of the waters, which rolled in &s;olemn &s;oundings upon the di&s;tant &s;hores. Fiery beams now marked the clouds, and the ea&s;t glowed with encrea&s;ing radiance, till the &s;un ro&s;e at once above the waves, and illumi|nating them with a flood of &s;plendour, diffu&s;ed gaiety and gladne&s;s around. The bold concave of the heavens, uniting with the va&s;t expan&s;e of the ocean, formed a <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> &s;triking and &s;ublime. The mag|nificence of the &s;cenery in&s;pired Julia with delight; and her heart dilating with high enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;he forgot the &s;orrows which had oppre&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>The breeze wa&s;ted the &s;hip gently along for &s;ome hours, when it gradually &s;unk into a calm. The glaffy &s;urface of the waters was not curled by the lighte&s;t air, and the ve&s;&s;el floated heavily on the bo&s;om of the deep. Sicily was yet in view, and the pre&s;ent delay agitated Julia with wild apprehen&s;ion. Towards the clo&s;e of day a light breeze &s;prang up, but it blew from Italy, and a train of dark vapours emerged from the verge of the horizon, which gradually accumu|lating, the heavens became entirely overca&s;t. The evening &s;hut in &s;uddenly: the ri&s;ing wind, the heavy clouds that loaded the atmo&s;phere, and the thunder which murmured afar off, terrified Julia, and threatened a violent &s;torm.</P>
<P>The tempe&s;t came on, and the captain vainly &s;ounded for anchorage: it was deep &s;ea, and the ve&s;&s;el drove furiou&s;ly before the wind. The darkne&s;s was interrupted only at intervals, by the broad expan&s;e of vivid lightnings, which quivered upon the waters, and di&s;clo&s;ing the horrible ga&s;pings of the waves, &s;erved to render the &s;ucceeding darkne&s;s more awful.

<P>Julia lay fainting with terror and &s;ickne&s;s in the cabin, and Ferdinand though almo&s;t hopele&s;s him&s;elf, was endeavouring to &s;upport her, when a loud and dreadful cra&s;h was heard from above. It &s;eemed as if the whole ve&s;&s;el had parted. The voices of the &s;ailors now ro&s;e together, and all was confu&s;ion and uproar. Ferdinand ran up to the deck, and learned that the main ma&s;t, borne away by the wind, had fallen upon the deck, whence it had rolled overboard.</P>
<P>It was now pa&s;t midnight, and the &s;torm continued with unabated f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry. For hours the ve&s;&s;el had been driven before the bla&s;t; and the captain now de|claring it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could weather the tempe&s;t much longer, ordered the long boat to be in readine&s;s. His orders were &s;carcely executed, when the &s;hip bulged upon a reef of rocks, and the impetuous waves ru&s;hed into the ve&s;&s;el:&mdash;a general groan en&s;ued. Fer|dinand flew to &s;ave his &s;i&s;ter, whom he carried to the boat, which was nearly filled by the captain and mo&s;t of the crew. The &s;ea ran &s;o high that it appeared impracticable to reach the &s;hore; but the boat had not moved many yards, when the &s;hip went to pieces. The captain now perceived by the fla&s;hes of lightning, a high rocky coa&s;t at about the di&s;tance of half a mile. The men &s;truggled hard at the oars; but almo&s;t as often as they gained the &s;ummit or a wave, it da&s;hed them back again, and made the labour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> little avail.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="029381_0177_0FE0D53C4BC67338">After much difficulty and fatigue they reached the coa&s;t, where a new danger pre&s;ented it&s;elf. They be|held a wild rocky &s;hore, who&s;e cliffs appeared inacce&s;|&s;ible, and which &s;eemed to afford little po&s;&s;ibility of landing. A landing, however was at la&s;t effected; and the &s;ailors, after much &s;earch, di&s;covered a kind of path-way cut in the rock, which they all a&s;cended in &s;afety.</P>
<P>The dawn now faintly glimmered, and they &s;urveyed the coa&s;t, but could di&s;cover no human habitation. They imagined they were on the &s;hores of Sicily, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no means of confirming this conjecture. Terror, &s;ickne&s;s, and fatigue had &s;ubdued the &s;trength and &s;pirit of Julia, and &s;he was obliged to re&s;t upon the rocks.</P>
<P>The &s;torm now &s;uddenly &s;ub&s;ided, and the total calm which &s;uccceded to the wild tumult of the winds and waves, produced a &s;triking and &s;ublime effect. The air was hu&s;hed into a deathlike &s;tillne&s;s, but the waves were yet violently agitated; and by the en|crea&s;ing light, parts of the wreck were &s;een floating wide upon the face of the deep. Some &s;ailors who had mi&s;&s;ed the boat were al&s;o di&s;covered clinging to pieces of the ve&s;&s;el, and making towards the &s;hore. On ob&s;erving this, their &s;hipmates immediately de&s;|cended to the boat; and putting off to &s;ea, re&s;cued them from their perilous &s;ituation. When Julia was &s;omewhat re-animated, they proceeded up the country in &s;earch of a dwelling.</P>
<P>They had travelled near half a league, when the &s;avage features of the country began to &s;often, and gradually changed to the picture&s;que beauty of Sici|lian &s;cenery. They now di&s;covered at &s;ome di&s;tance a villa, &s;eated on a gentle eminence crowned with woods.
<PB N="179" REF="029381_0178_0FE0D5422043CFB8">
It was the fir&s;t human habitation they had &s;een &s;ince they embarked for Italy; and Julia, who was almo&s;t &s;inking with fatigue, beheld it with delight. The captain and his men ha&s;tened towards it to make known their di&s;tre&s;s, while Ferdinand and Julia &s;lowly followed. They ob&s;erved the men enter the villa, one of whom quickly returned to acquaint them with the ho&s;pitable reception his comrades had received.</P>
<P>Julia with difficulty reached the edifice, at the door of which &s;he was met by a young cavalier, who&s;e plea&s;ing and intellige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> countenance immediately intere&s;ted her in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vour. He welcomed the &s;trangers with a benevolent politene&s;s, that di&s;&s;olved at once every uncomfortable feeling which their &s;ituation had excited, and produced an in&s;tantaneous ea&s;y con|fidence. Through a light and elegant hall, ri&s;ing into a dome, &s;upported by pillars of white marble, and adorned with bu&s;ts; he led them to a magnificent ve&s;ti|bule, which opened upon a lawn. Having &s;eated them at a table &s;pread with refre&s;hments; he left them, and they &s;urveyed with &s;urpri&s;e, the beauty of the adjacent &s;cene.</P>
<P>The lawn, which was on each &s;ide bounded by hanging woods, de&s;cended in gentle declivity to a fine lake, who&s;e &s;mooth &s;urface reflected the &s;urrounding &s;hades. Beyond appeared the di&s;tant country, ri&s;ing on the left into bold romantic mountains, and on the right, exhibiting a &s;oft and glowing land&s;cape, who&s;e tranquil beauty formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the wild &s;ublimity of the oppo&s;ite craggy heights. The blue and di&s;tant ocean terminated the view.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time the cavalier returned, conducting two ladies of a very engaging appearance, whom he pre&s;ented as his wife and &s;i&s;ter. They welcomed Julia
<PB N="180" REF="029381_0179_0FE0D547A6765810">
with graceful kindne&s;s; but fatigue &s;oon obliged her to retire to re&s;t, and a con&s;equent indi&s;po&s;ition en|crea&s;ed &s;o rapidly, as to render it impracticable for her to quit her pre&s;ent abode on that day. The cap|tain and his men proceeded on their way, leaving Ferdinand and Julia at the villa, where &s;he experienced every kind and tender affection.</P>
<P>The day which was to have devoted Julia to a cloi&s;|ter, was u&s;hered in at the abbey with the u&s;ual cere|monies. The church was ornamented, and all the inhabitants of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he mona&s;tery prepared to attend. The <HI>Padre Abate</HI> now exulted in the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme, and anticipated in imagination, the rage and vexation of the marquis, when he &s;hould di&s;cover that his daugh|ter was lo&s;t to him for ever.</P>
<P>The hour of celebration arrived, and he entered the church with a proud firm &s;tep, and with a countenance which depictured his inward triumph; he was pro|ceeding to the high altar, when he was told that Julia was no where to be found. A&s;toni&s;hment for a while &s;u&s;pended other emotions,&mdash;he yet believed it im|po&s;&s;ible that &s;he could have effected an e&s;cape, and or|dered every part of the abbey to be &s;earched&mdash;not forgetting the &s;ecret caverns belonging to the mona&s;|tery, which wound beneath the woods. When the &s;earch was over, and he became convinced &s;he was fled; the deep workings of his di&s;appointed pa&s;&s;ions fer|mented into rage which exceeded all bounds. He denounced the mo&s;t terrible judgments upon Julia; and calling for Madame de Menon, charged her with having in&s;ulting her holy religion, in being acce&s;&s;ary to the flight of Julia. Madame endured the&s;e re|proaches with calm dignity, and pre&s;erved a &s;teady &s;ilence; but &s;he &s;ecretly determined to leave the

mona&s;tery, and &s;eek in another, the repo&s;e which &s;he could never hope to find in this.</P>
<P>The report of Julia's di&s;appearance &s;pread rapidly beyond the walls, and &s;oon reached the ears of the marquis, who rejoiced in the circum&s;tance, believing that &s;he mu&s;t now inevitably fall into his hands.</P>
<P>After his people, in obedience to his orders, had carefully &s;earched the &s;urrounding woods and rocks, he withdrew them from the abbey; and having di&s;|per&s;ed them various ways in &s;earch of Julia, he return|ed to the ca&s;tle of Mazzini. Here new vexation a|waited him, for he now fir&s;t learned that Ferdinand had e&s;caped from confinement.</P>
<P>The my&s;tery of Julia's flight was now re&s;olved; for it was evident by who&s;e means &s;he had effected it, and the marquis i&s;&s;ued orders to his people to &s;ecure Ferdinand wherever he &s;hould be found.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>HIPPOLITUS, who had langui&s;hed under a long and dangerous illne&s;s produced by his wounds, but heightened and prolonged by the di&s;tre&s;s of his mind, was detained in a &s;mall town on the coa&s;ts of Calabria, and was yet ignorant of the death of Cornelia. He &s;carcely doubted that Julia was now devoted to the duke, and this thought was at times poi&s;on to his heart. After his arrival in Calabria, immediately on the recovery of his &s;en&s;es, he di&s;patched a &s;ervant back to the ca&s;tle of Mazzini, to gain &s;ecret intelligence of what had pa&s;&s;ed after his departure. The eagerne&s;s with which we endeavour to e&s;cape from mi&s;ery,
<PB N="182" REF="029381_0181_0FE0D551A2599440">
taught him to encourage a remote and romantic hope, that Julia yet lived for him. Yet even this hope at length langui&s;hed into de&s;pair, as the time elap&s;ed which &s;hould have brought his &s;ervant from Sicily. Days and weeks pa&s;&s;ed away in the utmo&s;t anxiety to Hippolitus, for &s;till his emi&s;&s;ary did not appear; and at la&s;t, concluding that he had been either &s;eized by rob|bers, or di&s;covered and detained by the marquis, the count &s;ent off a &s;econd emi&s;&s;ary to the ca&s;tle of Maz|zini. By him he learned the news of Julia's flight, and his heart dilated with joy; but it was &s;uddenly checked, when he heard the marquis had di&s;covered her retreat in the abbey of St. Augu&s;tin. The wounds which &s;till detained him in confinement now became intolerable. Julia might yet be lo&s;t to him for ever. But even his pre&s;ent &s;tate of fear and uncertainty was bli&s;s compared with the angui&s;h of de&s;pair, which his mind had long endured.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was &s;ufficiently recovered, he quitted Italy for Sicily, in the de&s;ign of vi&s;iting the mona&s;tery of St. Augu&s;tin, where it was po&s;&s;ible Julia might yet remain. That he might pa&s;s with the &s;ecrecy nece&s;|&s;ary to his plan, and e&s;cape the attacks of the mar|quis, he left his &s;ervants in Calabria and embarked alone.</P>
<P>It was morning when he landed at &s;mall port of Sicily, and proceeded towards the abbey of St. Au|gu&s;tin. As he travelled, his imagination revolved the &s;cenes of his early love, the di&s;tre&s;s of Julia, and the &s;ufferings of Ferdinand, and his heart melted at the retro&s;pect. He con&s;idered the probabilities of Julia's having found protection from her father in the pity of the <HI>Padre Abate;</HI> and even ventured to indulge him|&s;elf in a flattering, fond anticipation of the moment, when Julia &s;hould again be re&s;tored to his &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="029381_0182_0FE0D555A13CE170">He arrived at the mona&s;tery, and his grief may ea&s;ily be imagined, when he was informed of the death of his beloved &s;i&s;ter, and of the flight of Julia. He quitted St. Augu&s;tin's immediately, without even knowing that Madame de Menon was there, and &s;at out for a town at &s;ome leagues di&s;tance, where he de|&s;igned to pa&s;s the night.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbed in the melancholy reflexions which the late intelligence excited, he gave the reins to his hor&s;e, and journeyed on unmindful of his way. The even|ing was far advanced, when he di&s;covered that he had taken a wrong direction, and that he was bewildered in a wild and &s;olitary &s;cene. He had wandered too far from the road to hope to regain it, and he had be&s;ide no recollection of the objects left behind him. A choice of errors only, lay before him. The view on his right hand exhibited high and &s;avage mountains, covered with heath and black fir; and the wild de&s;o|lation of their a&s;pect, together with the dangerous ap|pearance of the path that wound up their &s;ides, and which was the only apparent track they afforded, de|termined Hippolitus not to attempt their a&s;cent. On his left lay a fore&s;t, to which the path he was then in led; its appearance was gloomy, but he preferred it to the mountains; and &s;ince he was uncertain of its extent, there was a po&s;&s;ibility that he might pa&s;s it, and reach a village before the night was &s;et in.&mdash;At the wor&s;t, the fore&s;t would afford him a &s;helter from the winds; and however he might be bewildered in its labyrinths, he could a&s;cend a tree, and re&s;t in &s;ecurity till the return of light &s;hould afford him an opportunity of extricating him&s;elf. Among the mountains there was no po&s;&s;ibility of meeting with other &s;helter than what the habitation of man afforded, and &s;uch a &s;helter there was little probability of finding. Innumerable dan|gers

al&s;o threatened him here, from which he would be &s;ecure on level ground.</P>
<P>Having determined which way to pur&s;ue, he pu&s;hed his hor&s;e into a gallop, and entered the fore&s;t as the la&s;t rays of the &s;un trembled on the mountains. The thick foliage of the trees threw a gloom around, which was every moment deepened by the &s;hades of evening. The path was uninterrupted, and the count continued to pur&s;ue it till all di&s;tinction was confounded in the veil of night. Total darkne&s;s now made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to pur&s;ue his way. He di&s;mounted, and fa&s;tening his hor&s;e to a tree, climbed among the branches, pur|po&s;ing to remain there till morning.</P>
<P>He had not been long in this &s;ituation, when a con|fu&s;ed &s;ound of voices from a di&s;tance rou&s;ed his atten|tion. The &s;ound returned at intervals for &s;ome time, but without &s;eeming to approach. He de&s;cended from the tree, that he might the better judge of the direc|tion whence it came; but before he reached the ground, the noi&s;e was cea&s;ed, and all was profoundly &s;ilent. He continued to li&s;ten, but the &s;ilence remain|ing undi&s;turbed, he began to think he had been de|ceived by the &s;inging of the wind among the leaves; and was preparing to re-a&s;cend, when he perceived a faint light glimmer through the foliage from afar. The &s;ight revived a hope that he was near &s;ome place of hu|man habitation; he therefore unfa&s;tened his hor&s;e, and led him towards the &s;pot whence the ray i&s;&s;ued. The moon was now ri&s;en, and threw a checquered gleam over his path &s;ufficient to direct him.</P>
<P>Before he had proceeded far, the light di&s;appeared. He continued however his way as nearly as he could gue&s;s, towards the place whence it had i&s;&s;ued; and af|ter much toil, found him&s;elf in a &s;pot where the trees formed a circle round a kind of rude lawn. The
<PB N="185" REF="029381_0184_0FE0D56195519C70">
moonlight di&s;covered to him an edifice which appear|ed to have been formerly a mona&s;tery, but which now exhibited a pile of ruins, who&s;e grandeur, heightened by decay, touched the beholder with reverential awe. Hippolitus pau&s;ed to gaze upon the &s;cene; the &s;acred &s;tillne&s;s of night encrea&s;ed its effect, and a &s;ecret dread, he knew not wherefore, &s;tole upon his heart.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence and the character of the place made him doubt whether this was the &s;pot he had been &s;eek|ing; and as he &s;tood he&s;itating whether to proceed or to return, he ob&s;erved a figure &s;tanding under an arch-way of the ruin; it carried a light in its hand, and pa&s;&s;ing &s;ilently along, di&s;appeared in a remote part of the building. The courage of Hippolitus for a moment de&s;erted him. An invincible curio&s;ity, how|ever, &s;ubdued his terror, and he determined to pur&s;ue, if po&s;&s;ible, the way the figure had taken.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed over loo&s;e &s;tones through a &s;ort of court, till he came to the arch-way; here he &s;topped, for fear returned upon him. Re&s;uming his courage, how|ever, he went on, &s;till endeavouring to follow the way the figure had pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;uddenly found him&s;elf in an enclo&s;ed part of the ruin, who&s;e appearance was more wild and de&s;olate than any he had yet &s;een. Seized with unconquerable apprehen&s;ion, he was re|tiring, when the low voice of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed per&s;on &s;truck his ear. His heart &s;unk at the &s;ound, his limbs trem|bled, and he was utterly unable to move.</P>
<P>The &s;ound which appeared to be the la&s;t groan of a dying per&s;on, was repeated. Hippolitus made a &s;trong effort, and &s;prang forward, when a light bur&s;t upon him from a &s;hattered ca&s;ement of the building, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant he heard the voices of men!</P>
<P>He advanced &s;oftly to the window, and beheld in a
<PB N="186" REF="029381_0185_0FE0D5670D27EF68">
&s;mall room, which was le&s;s decayed than the re&s;t of the edifice, a group of men, who from the &s;avagene&s;s of their looks, and from their dre&s;s, appeared to be ban|ditti. They &s;urrounded a man who lay on the ground wounded, and bathed in blood, and who it was very evident had uttered the groans heard by the count.</P>
<P>The ob&s;curity of the place prevented Hippolitus from di&s;tingui&s;hing the features of the dying man. From the blood which covered him, and from the &s;ur|rounding circum&s;tances, he appeared to be murdered; and the count had no doubt that the men he beheld were the murderers. The horror of the &s;cene entire|ly overcame him; he &s;tood rooted to the &s;pot, and &s;aw the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins rifle the pockets of the dying per&s;on, who in a voice &s;carcely articulate, but which de&s;pair &s;eemed to aid, &s;upplicated for mercy. The ruffians an&s;wered him only with execrations, and continued their plunder. His groans and his &s;ufferings &s;erved only to aggravate their cruelty. They were proceeding to take from him a miniature picture, which was fa&s;tened round his neck, and had been hitherto concealed in his bo&s;om; when by a &s;udden effort he half rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the ground, and attempted to &s;ave it from their hands. The effort availed him nothing; a blow from one of the villains laid the unfortunate man on the floor with|out motion. The horrid barbarity of the act &s;eized the mind of Hippolitus &s;o entirely, that forgetful of his own &s;ituation, he groaned aloud, and &s;tarted with an in&s;tantaneous de&s;ign of avenging the deed. The noi&s;e he made alarmed the banditti, who looking whence it came, di&s;covered the count through the ca&s;ement. They in&s;tantly quitted their prize, and ru&s;hed towards the door of the room. He was now re|turned to a &s;en&s;e of his danger, and endeavoured to e&s;|cape
<PB N="187" REF="029381_0186_0FE0D56B30579858">
to the exterior part of the ruin; but terror be|wildered his &s;en&s;es, and he mi&s;took his way. In&s;tead of regaining the arch-way, he perplexed him&s;elf with fruitle&s;s wanderings, and at length found him&s;elf only more deeply involved in the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the pile.</P>
<P>The &s;teps of his pur&s;uers gained fa&s;t upon him, and he continued to perplex him&s;elf with vain efforts at e&s;|cape, till at length, quite exhau&s;ted, he &s;unk on the ground, and endeavoured to re&s;ign him&s;elf to his fate. He li&s;tened with a kind of &s;tern de&s;pair, and was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find all &s;ilent. On looking round, he per|ceived by a ray of moon-light which &s;treamed through a part of the ruin from above, that he was in a &s;ort of vault, which, from the &s;mall means he had of judging, he thought was exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he remained for a con&s;iderable time, ruminating on the means of e&s;cape, yet &s;carcely be|lieving e&s;cape was po&s;&s;ible. If he continued in the vault, he might continue there only to be butchered; but by attempting to re&s;cue him&s;elf from the place he was now in, he mu&s;t ru&s;h into the hands of the ban|ditti. Judging it, therefore, the &s;afer way of the two to remain where he was, he endeavoured to await his fate with fortitude, when &s;uddenly the loud voices of the murderers bur&s;t upon his ear, and he heard &s;teps advancing quickly towards the &s;pot where he lay.</P>
<P>De&s;pair in&s;tantly renewed his vigour; he &s;tarted from the ground, and throwing round him a look of eager de&s;peration, his eye caught the glimp&s;e of a &s;mall door, upon which the moon-beam now fell. He made towards it, and pa&s;&s;ed it ju&s;t as the light of a torch gleamed upon the walls of the vault.</P>
<P>He groped his way along a winding pa&s;&s;age, and at length came to a flight of &s;teps. Notwith&s;tanding the darkne&s;s, he reached the bottom in &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="029381_0187_0FE0D571A2CE5EB0">He now for the fir&s;t time &s;topped to li&s;ten&mdash;the &s;ounds of pur&s;uit were cea&s;ed, and all was &s;ilent! Continuing to wander on in ineffectual endeavours to e&s;cape, his hands at length touched cold iron, and he quickly perceived it belonged to a door. The door however was fa&s;tened, and re&s;i&s;ted all his efforts to open it. He was giving up the attempt in de&s;pair, when a loud &s;cream from within, followed by a dead and heavy noi&s;e, rou&s;ed all his attention. Silence en|&s;ued. He li&s;tened for a con&s;iderable time at the door, his imagination filled with images of horror, and ex|pecting to hear the &s;ound repeated. He &s;ought for a decayed part of the door, through which he might di&s;cover what was beyond; but he could find none; and after waiting &s;ome time without hearing any far|ther noi&s;e, he was quitting the &s;pot, when in pa&s;&s;ing his arm over the door, it &s;truck again&s;t &s;omething hard. On examination he perceived to his extreme &s;urpri&s;e that the key was in the lock. For a moment he he&s;i|tated what to do; but curio&s;ity overcame other con|&s;iderations, and with a trembling hand he turned the key. The door opened into a large and de&s;olate a|partment, dimly lighted by a lamp that &s;tood on a table, which was almo&s;t the only furniture of the place. The count had not advanced &s;everal &s;teps before he per|ceived an object, which fixed all his attention. This was the figure of a young woman lying on the floor appar|ently dead. Her face was concealed in her robe; and the long auburn tre&s;&s;es which fell in beautiful luxuri|ance over her bo&s;om, &s;erved to veil a part of the glow|ing beauty which the di&s;order of her dre&s;s would have revealed.</P>
<P>Pity, &s;urpri&s;e, and admiration &s;truggled in the brea&s;t of Hippolitus; and while he &s;tood &s;urveying the ob|ject which excited the&s;e different emotions, he heard a
<PB N="189" REF="029381_0188_0FE0D576DDE97C68">
&s;tep advancing towards the room. He flew to the door by which he had entered, and was fortunate enough to reach it before the entrance of the per&s;ons who&s;e &s;teps he heard. Having turned the key, he &s;topped at the door to li&s;ten to their proceedings. He di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices of two men, and knew them to be tho&s;e of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. Pre&s;ently he heard a piercing &s;hriek, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant the voices of the ruffians grow loud and violent. One of them exclaimed that the lady was dying, and accu&s;ed the other of having frightened her to death, &s;wearing with horrid imprecations that &s;he was his, and he would defend her to the la&s;t drop of his blood. The di&s;pute grew higher; and neither of the ruffians would give up his claim to the unfortunate object of their altercation.</P>
<P>The cla&s;hing of &s;words was &s;oon after heard, toge|ther with a violent noi&s;e. The &s;creams were repeated, and the oaths and execrations of the di&s;putants re|doubled. They &s;eemed to move towards the door, behind which Hippolitus was concealed; &s;uddenly the door was &s;hook with great force, a deep groan followed, and was in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded by a noi&s;e like that of a per&s;on who&s;e whole weight falls at once to the ground. For a moment all was &s;ilent. Hippo|litus had no doubt that one of the ruffians had de&s;|troyed the other, and was &s;oon confirmed in the be|lief&mdash;for the &s;urvivor triumphed with brutal exultation over his fallen antagoni&s;t. The ruffian ha&s;tily quitted the room, and Hippolitus &s;oon after heard the di&s;tant voices of &s;everal per&s;ons in loud di&s;pute. The &s;ounds &s;eemed to come from a chamber over the place where he &s;tood; he al&s;o heard a trampling of feet from above, and could even di&s;tingui&s;h, at intervals, the words of the di&s;putants. From the&s;e he gathered enough to learn that the affray which had ju&s;t hap|pened,
<PB N="190" REF="029381_0189_0FE0D3679490CD10">
and the lady who had been the occa&s;ion of it, were the &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e. The voices frequently ro&s;e together, and confounded all di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>At length the tumult began to &s;ub&s;ide, and Hippo|litus could di&s;tingui&s;h what was &s;aid. The ruffians agreed to give up the lady in que&s;tion to him who had fought for her; and leaving him to his prize, they all went out in que&s;t of farther prey. The &s;ituation of the unfortunate lady excited a mixture of pity and indignation in Hippolitus, which for &s;ome time en|tirely occupied him; he revolved the means of ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri|cating her from &s;o deplorable a &s;ituation, and in the&s;e thoughts almo&s;t forgot his own danger. He now heard her &s;ighs; and while his heart melted to the &s;ounds, the farther door of the apartment was thrown open, and the wretch to whom &s;he had been allotted, ru&s;hed in. Her &s;creams now redoubled, but they were of no avail with the ruffian who had &s;eized her in his arms; when the count, who was unarmed, in|&s;en&s;ible to every impul&s;e but that of a generous pity, bur&s;t into the room, but became fixed like a &s;tatue when he beheld his Julia &s;truggling in the gra&s;p of the ruffian. On di&s;covering Hippolitus, &s;he made a &s;udden &s;pring, and liberated her&s;elf; when, running to him, &s;he &s;unk lifele&s;s in his arms.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e and fury &s;parkled in the eyes of the ruffian, and he turned with a &s;avage de&s;peration upon the count; who, relinqui&s;hing Julia, &s;natched up the &s;word of the dead ruffian, which lay upon the floor, and defended him&s;elf. The combat was furious, but Hippolitus laid his antagoni&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s at his feet. He flew to Julia, who now revived, but who for &s;ome time could &s;peak only by her tears. The tran&s;itions of various and rapid &s;en&s;ations, which her heart experienced, and the &s;trangely mingled emotions of joy and terror that
<PB N="191" REF="029381_0190_0FE0D582CFA09470">
agitated Hippolitus, can only be under&s;tood by expe|rience. He rai&s;ed her from the floor, and endeavoured to &s;oothe her to compo&s;ure, when &s;he called wildly upon Ferdinand. At his name the count &s;tarted, and in&s;tantly remembered the dying cavalier, who&s;e coun|tenance the glooms had concealed from his view. His heart thrilled with &s;ecret agony, yet he re&s;olved to withhold his terrible conjectures from Julia, of whom he learned that Ferdinand, with her&s;elf, had been taken by banditti in the way from the villa which had offered them &s;o ho&s;pitable a reception after the &s;hip-wreck. They were on the road to a port whence they de&s;igned again to embark for Italy, when this misfortune over|took them. Julia added that Ferdinand had been im|mediately &s;eparated from her; and that, for &s;ome hours, &s;he had been confined in the apartment where Hippolitus found her. The count with difficulty con|cealed his terrible apprehen&s;ions for Ferdinand, and vainly &s;trove to &s;often Julia's di&s;tre&s;s. But there was no time to be lo&s;t&mdash;they had yet to find a way out of the edifice, and before they could accompli&s;h this, the banditti might return. It was al&s;o po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of the party were left to watch this their abode during the ab&s;ence of the re&s;t, and this was another circum|&s;tance of rea&s;onable alarm.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little con&s;ideration, Hippolitus judged it mo&s;t prudent to &s;eek an outlet through the pa&s;&s;age by which he entered; he therefore took the lamp, and led Julia to the door. They entered the avenue, and locking the door after them, &s;ought the flight of &s;teps down which the count had before pa&s;&s;ed; but having pur&s;ued the windings of the avenue a con&s;idera|ble time without finding them, he became certain he had mi&s;taken the way. They, however, found ano|ther flight, which they de&s;cended, and entered upon
<PB N="192" REF="029381_0191_0FE0D58839C17A08">
a pa&s;&s;age &s;o very narrow and low, as not to admit of a per&s;on walking upright. This pa&s;&s;age was clo&s;ed by a door, which on examination was found to be chiefly of iron. Hippolitus was &s;tartled at the &s;ight, but on applying his &s;trength found it gradually yield, when the impri&s;oned air ru&s;hed out, and had nearly extingui&s;hed the light. They now entered upon a dark aby&s;s; and the door which moved upon a &s;pring, &s;uddenly clo&s;ed upon them. On looking around they beheld a large vault&punc; and it is not ea&s;y to imagine their horror on di&s;covering they were in a receptacle for the murdered bodies of the unfortunate people who had fallen into the hands of the banditti.</P>
<P>The count could &s;carcely &s;upport the fainting &s;pirits of Julia; he ran to the door which he endeavoured to open, but the lock are &s;o con&s;tructed that it could be moved only on the other &s;ide, and all his efforts were u&s;ele&s;s. He was con&s;trained, therefore, to &s;eek for another door, but could find none. Their &s;ituation was the mo&s;t deplorable that can be imagined: for they were now inclo&s;ed in a vault &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn with the dead bodies of the murdered, and mu&s;t there become the victims of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mine, or of the &s;word. The earth was in &s;everal places thrown up, and marked the boundaries of new made graves. The bodies which remained un|buried were probably left either from hurry o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> negli|gence, and exhilated a &s;pectacle too &s;hocking for huma|nity. The &s;ufferings of Hippolitus were increa&s;ed by tho&s;e of Julia, who was &s;inking with horror, and who he endeavoured to &s;upport to a part of the vault which fell into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">is&mdash;wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;tood a bench.</P>

<P><PB N="193" REF="029381_0192_0FE0D58FEC79F0C8">The noi&s;e increa&s;ed, and they could di&s;tingui&s;h voices. Hippolitus believed the murderers were re|turned; that they had traced his retreat, and were coming towards the vault by &s;ome way unknown to him. He prepared for the wor&s;t&mdash;and drawing his &s;word, re&s;olved to defend Julia to the la&s;t. Their apprehen&s;ion, however, was &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated by a tram|pling of hor&s;es, which &s;ound had occa&s;ioned his alarm, and which now &s;eemed to come from a court-yard above, extremely near the vault. He di&s;tinctly heard the voices of the banditti, together with the moans and &s;upplications of &s;ome per&s;on, whom it was evi|dent they were about to plunder. The &s;ound ap|peared &s;o very near, that Hippolitus was both &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed; and looking round the vault, he per|ceived a &s;mall grated window placed very high in the wall, which he concluded overlooked the place where the robbers were a&s;&s;embled. He recollected that his light might betray him; and horrible as was the al|ternative, he was compelled to extingui&s;h it. He now attempted to climb to the grate, through which he might obtain a view of what was pa&s;&s;ing without. This at length he effected, for the ruggedne&s;s of the wall afforded him a footing. He beheld in a ruinous court, which was partially illuminated by the glare of torches, a group of banditti &s;urrounding two per&s;ons who were bound on hor&s;e-back, and who were &s;uppli|cating for mercy.</P>
<P>One of the robbers exclaiming with an oath that this was a golden night, bade his comrades di&s;patch, add|ing he would go to find Paulo and the lady.</P>
<P>The effect which the latter part of this &s;entence had upon the pri&s;oners in the vault, may be more ea&s;ily imagined than de&s;cribed. They were now in total darkne&s;s in this man&s;ion of the murdered, without

means of e&s;cape, and in momentary expectation of &s;haring a fate &s;imilar to that of the wretched objects around them. Julia overcome with di&s;tre&s;s and ter|ror, &s;unk on the ground; and Hippolitus, de&s;cending from the grate, became in&s;en&s;ible of his own danger in his apprehen&s;ion for her.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time all without was confu&s;ion and up|roar; the ruffian who had left the court returned with the alarm that the lady was fled, and that Paulo was murdered. The robbers quitted their booty to go in &s;earch of the fugitive, and to di&s;cover the murderer, dreadful vociferations re&s;ounded through every rece&s;s of the pile.</P>
<P>The tumult had continued a con&s;iderable time, which the pri&s;oners had pa&s;&s;ed in a &s;tate of horrible &s;u&s;pence, when they heard the uproar advancing to|wards the vault, and &s;oon after a number of voices &s;houted down the avenue. The &s;ound of &s;teps quick|ened. Hippolitus again drew his &s;word, and placed him&s;elf oppo&s;ite the entrance, where he had not &s;tood long, when a violent pu&s;h was made again&s;t the door; it flew open, and a party of men ru&s;hed into the vault.</P>
<P>Hippolitus kept his po&s;ition, prote&s;ting he would de&s;troy the fir&s;t who approached. At the &s;ound of his voice they &s;topped; but pre&s;ently advancing, commanded him in the king's name to &s;urrender. He now di&s;covered what his agitation had prevented hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from ob&s;erving &s;ooner, that the men, before him were not banditti, but the officers of ju&s;tice. They had received information of this haunt of villainy from the &s;on of a Sicilian nobleman, who had fallen into the hands of this banditti and had afterwards e&s;caped from from their power.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="029381_0194_0FE0D598B24C4FF0">The officers came attended by a guard, and were every way prepared to pro&s;ecute a &s;trenuous &s;earch through the&s;e horrible rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Hippolitus inquired for Ferdinand, and they all quitted the vault in &s;earch of him. In the court, to which they now a&s;cended, the greater part of the banditti were &s;ecured by a number of the guard. The count accu&s;ed the robbers of having &s;ecreted his friend, whom he de&s;cribed, and demanded to have liberated.</P>
<P>With one voice they denied the fact, and were re|&s;olute in per&s;i&s;ting that they knew nothing of the per|&s;on de&s;cribed. This denial confirmed Hippolitus in his former terrible &s;urmi&s;e; that the dying cavalier whom he had &s;een, was no other than Ferdinand, and he became furious. He bade the officers pro&s;ecute their &s;earch, who, leaving a guard over the banditti they had &s;ecured, followed him to the room, where the late dreadful &s;cene had been acted.</P>
<P>The room was dark and empty, but the traces of blood were vi&s;ible on the floor; and Julia, though ig|norant of the particular apprehen&s;ion of Hippolitus, almo&s;t &s;wooned at the &s;ight. On quitting the room, they wandered for &s;ome time among the ruins, with|out di&s;covering any thing extraordinary, till, in pa&s;s|ing under the arch-way by which Hippolitus had fir&s;t entered the ruins, their foot&s;teps returned a deep &s;ound, which convinced them that the ground beneath was hollow. On clo&s;e examination, they perceived by the light of their torch, a trap-door, which with &s;ome difficulty they lifted, and di&s;coveved beyond a narrow flight of &s;teps. They all de&s;cended into a low winding pa&s;&s;age, where they had not been long, when they heard a trampling of hor&s;es above, and a loud and &s;udden uproar.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="029381_0195_0FE0D59EF2E38EB0">The officers apprehending that the banditti had overcome the guard, ru&s;hed back to the trap-door&punc; which they had &s;carcely lifted, when they heard a cla&s;hing of &s;words, and a confu&s;ion of unknown voices. Looking onward, they beheld through the arch, in an inner &s;ort of court, a large party of banditti who were ju&s;t arrived, re&s;cuing their comrades, and con|tending furiou&s;ly with the guard.</P>
<P>On ob&s;erving this, &s;everal of the officers &s;prang for|ward to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their friends; and the re&s;t, &s;ubdued by cowardice, hurried down the &s;teps, letting the trap door fall after them with a thundering noi&s;e. They gave notice to Hippolitus of what was pa&s;&s;ing above, who hurried Julia along the pa&s;&s;age in &s;earch of &s;ome outlet o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> concealment. They could find neither; and had not long pur&s;ued the windings of the way, when they heard the trap door lifted, and the &s;teps of per&s;ons de&s;cending.

<P>The door was fa&s;tened by &s;trong iron bolts, which Hippolitus vainly endeavoured to draw. The voices drew near. After much labour and difficulty the bolts yielded&mdash;the door unclo&s;ed&mdash;and light dawned upon them through the mouth of a cave, into which they now entered. On quitting the cave they found them&s;elves in the fore&s;t, and in a &s;hort time reached the borders. They now ventured to &s;top, and looking back perceived no per&s;on in pur&s;uit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Julia had re&s;ted, they followed the track before them, and in a &s;hort time arrived at a village where they obtained &s;ecurity and refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>But Julia, who&s;e mind was occupied with dreadful anxiety concerning Ferdinand, became indifferent to all around her. Even the pre&s;ence of Hippolitus, which but lately would have rai&s;ed her from mi&s;ery to joy, failed to &s;oothe her di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;teady and noble attachment of her brother had &s;unk deep in her heart, and reflexion only aggravated her affliction. Yet the banditti had &s;teadily per&s;i&s;ted in affirming that he was not concealed in their rece&s;&s;es; and this circum&s;tance, which threw a deeper &s;hade over the fears of Hippo|litus, imparted a glimmering of hope to the mind of Julia.</P>
<P>A more immediate intere&s;t at length forced her mind from this &s;orrowful &s;ubject. It was nece&s;&s;ary to de|termine upon &s;ome line of conduct, for &s;he was now in an unknown &s;pot, and ignorant of any place of refuge. The count, who trembled at the dangers which en|vironed her, and at the probabilities he &s;aw of her being torn from him for ever, &s;uffered a con&s;ideration of them to overcome the dangerous delicacy which at this mournful period required his &s;ilence. He entreated her to de&s;troy the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eparation, by con|&s;enting to become his immediately. He urged that a prie&s;t could be ea&s;ily procured from a neighbouring convent, who would confirm the bonds which had &s;o long united their hearts, and who would thus at once arre&s;t the de&s;tiny that &s;o long had threatened his hopes.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al, though &s;imilar to the one &s;he had before accepted; and though the certain means of
<PB N="198" REF="029381_0197_0FE0D5A96A7F6500">
re&s;cuing her from the fate &s;he dreaded, &s;he now turned from in &s;orrow and dejection. She loved Hippolitus with a &s;teady and tender affection, which was &s;till heightened by the gratitude he claimed as her deli|verer; but &s;he con&s;idered it a prophanation of the memory of that brother who had &s;uffered &s;o much for her &s;ake, to mingle joy with the grief which her un|certainty&punc; concerning him occa&s;ioned. She &s;oftened her refu&s;al with a tender grace, that quickly di&s;&s;ipated the jealous doubt ari&s;ing in the mind of Hippolitus, and encrea&s;ed his fond admiration of her character.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired to retire for a time to &s;ome ob&s;cure con|vent, there to await the i&s;&s;ue of the event, which at pre&s;ent involved her in perplexity and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Hippolitus &s;truggled with his feelings and forbore to pre&s;s farther the &s;uit on which his happine&s;s, and almo&s;t his exi&s;tence now depended. He inquired at the village for a neighbouring convent, and was told that there was none within twelve leagues, but that near the town of Palini, at about that di&s;tance, were two. He procured hor&s;es, and leaving the officers to return to Palermo for a &s;tronger guard, he, accom|panied by Julia, entered on the road to Palini.</P>
<P>Julia was &s;ilent and thoughtful; Hippolitus gra|dually &s;unk into the &s;ame mood, and he often ca&s;t a cautious look around as they travelled for &s;ome hours along the foot of the mountains. They &s;topped to dine under the &s;hade of &s;ome beech trees; for, fearful of di&s;covery, Hippolitus had provided again&s;t the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of entering many inns. Having fini&s;hed their repa&s;t, they pur&s;ued their journey; but Hippolitus now began to doubt whether he was in the right direction. Being de&s;titute, however, of the means of certainty upon this point, he followed the road before him, which now wound up the &s;ide of a &s;teep hill, whence
<PB N="199" REF="029381_0198_0FE0D5AD73FAC728">
they de&s;cended into a rich valley, where the &s;hepherd's pipe &s;ounded &s;weetly from afar among the hills. The evening &s;un &s;hed a mild and mellow lu&s;tre over the land&s;cape, and &s;oftened each feature with a vermil glow that would have in&s;pired a mind le&s;s occupied than Julia's, with &s;en&s;ations of congenial tranquillity.</P>
<P>The evening now clo&s;ed in; and as they were doubt|ful of the road, and &s;ound it would be impo&s;&s;ible to reach Palini that night, they took the way to a village, which they perceived at the extremity of the valley.</P>
<P>They had proceeded about half a mile, when they heard a &s;udden &s;hout of voices echoed from among the hills behind them; and looking back, perceived faintly through the du&s;k a party of men on hor&s;eback making towards them. As they drew nearer, the words they &s;poke were di&s;tingui&s;hable, and Julia heard her own name &s;ounded. Shocked at this circum&s;tance, &s;he had now no doubt that &s;he was di&s;covered by a party of her father's people, and &s;he &s;ted with Hippolitus along the valley. The pur&s;uers, however, were almo&s;t come up with them, when they reached the mouth of a ca|vern, into which &s;he ran for concealment. Hippolitus drew his &s;word; and awaiting his enemies, &s;tood to defend the entrance.</P>
<P>In a few moments Julia heard the cla&s;hing of &s;words. Her heart trembled for Hippolitus; and &s;he was upon the point of returning to re&s;ign her&s;elf at once to the power of her enemies, and thus avert the danger that threatened him, when &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the loud voice of the duke.</P>
<P>She &s;hrunk involuntarily at the found, and pur&s;uing the windings of the cavern, fled into its inmo&s;t re|ce&s;&s;es. Here &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had not been long when the voices &s;ounded through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he cave, and drew near. It was
<PB N="200" REF="029381_0199_0FE0D64C7B7413D8">
now evident that Hippolitus was conquered, and that her enemies were in &s;earch of her. She threw round a look of unutterable angui&s;h, and perceived very near, by a &s;udden gleam of torch-light, a low and deep rece&s;s in the rock. The light, which belonged to her pur&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, grew &s;tronger; and &s;he entered the rock on her knees, for the overhanging crags would not &s;uffer her to pa&s;s otherwi&s;e; and having gone a few yards, perceived that it was terminated by a door. The door yielded to her touch, and &s;he &s;uddenly found her&s;elf in a highly vaulted cavern, which received a feeble light from the moon-beams that &s;treamed through an open|ing in the rock above.</P>
<P>She clo&s;ed the door, and pau&s;ed to li&s;ten. The voices grew louder, and more di&s;tinct, and at la&s;t approached &s;o near that &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed what was &s;aid. Above the re&s;t &s;he heard the voice of the duke. "It is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he can have quitted the cavern," &s;aid he, "and I will not leave it till I have found her. Seek to the left of that rock, while I examine beyond this point."</P>
<P>The&s;e words were &s;ufficient for Julia; &s;he fled from the door acro&s;s the cavern before her, and having ran a con&s;iderable way without coming to a termination, &s;topped to breathe. All was now &s;till; and as &s;he looked around, the gloomy ob&s;curity of the place &s;truck upon her fancy all its horrors. She imperfectly &s;urveyed the va&s;tne&s;s of the cavern in wild amazement, and feared that &s;he had precipitated her&s;elf again into the power of banditti, for whom alone this place ap|peared a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it receptacle. Having li&s;tened a long time without hearing a return of voices, &s;he &s;ought to find the door by which &s;he had entered, but the gloom, and va&s;t extent of the cavern, made the endeavour hopele&s;s, and the attempt un&s;ucce&s;sful. Having wandered a con&s;iderable time through the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id,
<PB N="201" REF="029381_0200_0FE0D5B30DC65248">
&s;he gave up the effort, endeavoured to re&s;ign her&s;elf to her fate, and to compo&s;e her di&s;tracted thoughts. The remembrance of her former wonderful e&s;cape in&s;pired her with confidence in the mercy of God. But Hip|politus and Ferdinand were now both lo&s;t to her&mdash; lo&s;t perhaps for ever&mdash;and the uncertainty of their fate gave force to fancy, and poignancy to &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Towards morning, grief yielded to nature, and Julia &s;unk to repo&s;e. She was awakened by the &s;un, who&s;e rays darting obliquely through the opening in the rock, threw a partial light acro&s;s the cavern. Her &s;en&s;es were yet bewildered by &s;leep, and &s;he &s;tarted in affright on beholding her &s;ituation; as recollection gradually &s;tole upon her mind, her &s;orrows returned, and &s;he &s;ickened at the fatal retro&s;pect.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e, and renewed her &s;earch for an outlet. The light, imperfect as it was, now a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, and &s;he found a door, which &s;he perceived was not the one by which &s;he had entered. It was firmly fa&s;tened; &s;he di&s;covered, however, the bolts and the lock that held it, and at length unclo&s;ed the door. It opened upon a dark pa&s;&s;age, which &s;he entered.</P>
<P>She groped along the winding walls for &s;ome time, when &s;he perceived the way was ob&s;tructed. She now di&s;covered that a door interrupted her progre&s;s, and &s;ought for the bolts which might fa&s;ten it.

On perceiving Julia, &s;he &s;tarted from her &s;eat, and her countenance expre&s;&s;ed a wild &s;urpri&s;e. Her features, which were worn by &s;orrow, &s;till retained the traces of
<PB N="202" REF="029381_0201_0FE0D5BA68A672C8">
beauty, and in her air was a mild dignity that excited in Julia an involuntary veneration.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed as if about to &s;peak, when fixing her eyes earne&s;tly and &s;teadily upon Julia, &s;he &s;tood for a moment in eager gaze, and &s;uddenly exclaiming, "My daughter!" fainted away.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hment of Julia would &s;carcely &s;uffer her to a&s;&s;i&s;t the lady, who lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor. A mul|titude of &s;trange imperfect ideas ru&s;hed upon her mind, and &s;he was lo&s;t in confu&s;ion and perplexity; but as &s;he examined the features of the &s;tranger, which were now re-kindling into life, &s;he thought &s;he di&s;covered the re&s;emblance of Emilia!</P>
<P>The lady breathing a deep &s;igh, unclo&s;ed her eyes; &s;he rai&s;ed them to Julia, who hung over her in &s;peechle&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment, and fixing them upon her with a tender earne&s;t expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;they filled with tears. She pre&s;&s;ed Julia to her heart, and a few moments of exqui&s;ite, un|utterable emotion followed. When the lady grew more compo&s;ed, "Thank heaven!" &s;aid &s;he, "my prayer is granted. I am permitted to embrace one of my children before I die. Tell me what brought you hither. Has the marquis at la&s;t relented, and allowed me once more to behold you, or has his death di&s;&s;olved my wretched bondage?"</P>
<P>Truth now glimmered upon the mind of Julia, but &s;o faintly, that in&s;tead of enlightening, it &s;erved only to encrea&s;e her perplexity.</P>
<P>"Is the marquis Mazzini living?" continued the lady. The&s;e words were not to be doubted; Julia threw her&s;elf at the feet of her mother, and embracing her knees in an energy of joy, an&s;wered only in &s;obs.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s eagerly inquired after her children. "Emilia is living," an&s;wered Julia, "but my dear brother&mdash;" "Tell me," cried the marchione&s;s with
<PB N="203" REF="029381_0202_0FE0D5BF0054EE30">
quickne&s;s. An explanation en&s;ued. When &s;he was informed concerning Ferdinand, &s;he &s;ighed deeply, and rai&s;ing her eyes to heaven, endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume a look of pious re&s;ignation; but the &s;truggle of mater|nal feeling was vi&s;ible in her countenance, and almo&s;t overcame her powers of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Julia gave a &s;hort account of the preceding adven|tures, and of her entrance into the cavern; and found to her inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e, that &s;he was now in a &s;ub|&s;ubterranean abode belonging to the &s;outhern build|ings of the ca&s;tle of Mazzini! The marchione&s;s was beginning her narrative, when a door was heard to un|lock above, and the &s;ound of a foot&s;tep followed.</P>
<P>"Fly!" cried the marchione&s;s, "&s;ecrete your&s;elf if po&s;&s;ible, for the marquis is coming." Julia's heart &s;unk at the&s;e words; &s;he pau&s;ed not a moment, but re|tired through the door by which &s;he had entered. This &s;he had &s;carcely done, when another door of the cell was unlocked, and &s;he heard the voice of her fa|ther. Its &s;ounds thrilled her with univer&s;al tremor; the dread of di&s;covery &s;o &s;trongly operated upon her mind, that &s;he &s;tood in momentary expectation of &s;ee|ing the door of the pa&s;&s;age unclo&s;ed by the marquis; and &s;he was deprived of all power of &s;eeking refuge in the cavern.</P>
<P>At length the marquis, who came with food, quitted the cell, and re-locked the door, when Julia &s;tole forth from her hiding place. The marchione&s;s again em|braced, and wept over her daughter. The narrative of her &s;ufferings upon which &s;he now entered, entirely di&s;&s;ipated the my&s;tery which had &s;o long enveloped the &s;outhern buildings of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"Oh! why," &s;aid the marchione&s;s, "is it my ta&s;k to di&s;cover to my daughter the vices of her father? In relating my &s;ufferings, I reveal his crime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">!
<PB N="204" REF="029381_0203_0FE0D5C339AC4840">
It is now about fifteen years, as near as I can gue&s;s from the &s;mall means I have of judging, &s;ince I entered this horrible abode. My &s;orrows, alas! be|gan not here; they commenced at an earlier period. But it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the pa&s;&s;ion whence originated all my misfortunes, was di&s;covered by me long before I experienced the more baleful effect of its influence.</P>
<P>"Seven years had elap&s;ed &s;ince my marriage, when the charms of Maria de Vellorno, a young lady &s;in|gularly beautiful, in&s;pired the marquis with a pa&s;&s;ion as violent as it was irregular. I ob&s;erved with a deep and &s;ilent angui&s;h, the cruel indifference of my lord towards me, and the rapid progre&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion for another. I &s;everely examined my pa&s;t conduct, which I am thankful to &s;ay pre&s;ented a retro&s;pect of only blamele&s;s actions; and I endeavoured by meek &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, and tender a&s;&s;iduities, to recall that affec|tion which was, alas! gone for ever. My meek &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion was con&s;idered as marks of a &s;ervile and in&s;en|&s;ible mind; and my tender a&s;&s;iduities, to which his heart no longer re&s;ponded, created only di&s;gu&s;t, and exalted the proud &s;pirit it was meant to conciliate.</P>
<P>"The &s;ecret grief which this change occa&s;ioned, con&s;umed my &s;pirits, and preyed upon my con&s;titution, till at length a &s;evere illne&s;s threatened my life. I be|held the approach of death with a &s;teady eye, and even welcomed it as the pa&s;s-port to tranquillity; but it was de&s;tined that I &s;hould linger through new &s;cenes of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>"One day, which it appears was the paroxy&s;m of my di&s;order, I &s;unk into a &s;tate of total torpidity, in which I lay for &s;everal hours. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe my feelings, when, on recovering, I found my|&s;elf in this hideous abode. For &s;ome time I doubted
<PB N="205" REF="029381_0204_0FE0D5C9BA0B5830">
my &s;en&s;es, and afterwards believed that I had quitted this world for another; but I was not &s;uffered to con|tinue in my error, the appearance of the marquis bringing me to a perfect &s;en&s;e of my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"I now under&s;tood that I had been conveyed by his direction to this rece&s;s of horror, where it was his will I &s;hould remain. My prayers, my &s;upplications were ineffectual; the hardne&s;s of his heart repelled my &s;orrows back upon my&s;elf; and as no entreaties could prevail upon him to inform me where I was, or of his rea&s;on for placing me here, I remained for many years ignorant of my vicinity to the ca&s;tle, and of the motive for my confinement.</P>
<P>"From that fatal day, until very lately, I &s;aw the marquis no more&mdash;but was attended by a per&s;on who had been for &s;ome years dependant upon his bounty, and whom nece&s;&s;ity, united to an in&s;en&s;ible heart, had doubtle&s;s induced to accept this office. He generally brought me a week's provi&s;ions, at &s;tated intervals, and I remarked that his vi&s;its were always in the night.</P>
<P>"Contrary to my expectation, or my wi&s;h, nature did that for me which medicine had refu&s;ed, and I recovered as if to puni&s;h with di&s;appointment and anxiety my cruel tyrant. I afterwards learned, that in obedience to the marquis's order, I had been car|ried to this &s;pot by Vincent during the night, and that I had been buried in effigy at a neighbouring church, with all the pomp of funeral honour due to my rank."</P>
<P>At the name of Vincent, Julia &s;tarted; the doubtful words he had uttered on his death-bed were now ex|plained&mdash;the cloud of my&s;tery which had &s;o long in|volved the &s;outhern buildings broke at once away; and each particular circum&s;tance that had excited her former terror, aro&s;e to her view entirely unveiled by the words of the marchione&s;s&mdash;The long and total
<PB N="206" REF="029381_0205_0FE0D5CF446D1650">
de&s;ertion of this part of the fabric&mdash;the light that had appeared through the ca&s;ement&mdash;the figure &s;he had &s;een i&s;&s;ue from the tower&mdash;the midnight noi&s;es &s;he had heard&mdash;were circum&s;tances evidently dependant on the impri&s;onment of the marchione&s;s; the latter of which incidents were produced either by Vincent, or the marquis, in their attendance upon her.</P>
<P>When &s;he con&s;idered the long and dreadful &s;uffer|ings of her mother, and that &s;he had for many years lived &s;o near her ignorant of her mi&s;ery, and even her exi&s;tence&mdash;&s;he was lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment and pity.</P>
<P>"My days," continued the marchione&s;s, "pa&s;&s;ed in a dead uniformity, more dreadful than the mo&s;t acute vici&s;&s;itudes of misfortune, and which would cer|tainly have &s;ubdued my rea&s;on, had not tho&s;e firm principles of religious faith, which I imbibed in early youth, enabled me to with&s;tand the &s;till, but forceful, pre&s;&s;ure of my calamity.</P>
<P>"The in&s;en&s;ible heart of Vincent at length began to &s;often by my misfortunes. He brought me &s;everal articles of comfort, of which I had hitherto been de&s;ti|tute, and an&s;wered &s;ome que&s;tions I put to him con|cerning my family. To relea&s;e me from my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, however his inclination might befriend me, was not to be expected, &s;ince his life would have paid the forfeiture of what would be termed his duty.</P>
<P>"I now fir&s;t di&s;covered my vicinity to the ca&s;tle. I learned al&s;o, that the marquis had married Maria de Vellorno, with whom he re&s;ided at Naples, but that my daughters were left at Mazzini. This la&s;t intelli|gence awakened in my heart the throbs of warm ma|ternal tenderne&s;s, and on my knees I &s;upplicated to &s;ee them. So earne&s;tly I entreated, and &s;o &s;olemnly I promi&s;ed to return quietly to my pri&s;on, that at length,
<PB N="207" REF="029381_0206_0FE0D5D510DE5818">
prudence yielded to pity, and Vincent con&s;ented to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>"On the &s;ucceeding day he came to the cell, and informed me my children were going into the woods, and that I might &s;ee them f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m a window near which they would pa&s;s. My nerves thrilled at the&s;e words, and I could &s;carcely &s;upport my&s;elf to the &s;pot I &s;o eagerly &s;ought. He led me through long and intricate pa&s;|&s;ages, as I gue&s;&s;ed by the frequent turnings, for my eyes were bound, till I reached a hall of the &s;outh buildings. I followed to a room above, where the full light of day once more bur&s;t upon my &s;ight, and al|mo&s;t overpowered me. Vincent placed me by a win|dow, which looked towards the woods. Oh! what moments of painful impatience were tho&s;e in which I awaited your arrival!"</P>
<P>"At length you appeared. I &s;aw you&mdash;I &s;aw my children&mdash;and was neither permitted to cla&s;p them to my heart, or to &s;peak to them! You was leaning on the arm of your &s;i&s;ter, and your countenances &s;poke the &s;prightly happy innocence of youth.&mdash;Alas! you knew not the wretched fate of your mother, who then gazed upon you! Although you were at too great a di&s;tance for my weak voice to reach you, with the utmo&s;t difficulty, I avoided throwing open the win|dow, and endeavouring to di&s;cover my&s;elf. The re|membrance of my &s;olemn premi&s;e, and that the life of Vincent would be &s;acrificed by the act, alone re&s;train|ed me. I &s;truggled for &s;ome time with emotions too powerful for my nature, and fainted away.</P>
<P>"On recovering I called wildly for my children, and went to the window&mdash;but you were gone! Not all the entreaties of Vincent could for &s;ome time re|move me from this &s;tation, where I waited in the fond expectation of &s;eeing you again&mdash;but you appeared no

more! At la&s;t I returned to my cell in an exta&s;y of grief which I tremble even to remember.</P>
<P>"This interview, &s;o eagerly &s;ought, and &s;o re|luctantly granted, proved a &s;ource of new mi&s;ery&mdash; in&s;tead of calming, it agitated my mind with a re&s;tle&s;s wild de&s;pair, which bore away my &s;tronge&s;t powers of re&s;i&s;tance. I raved ince&s;&s;antly of my children, and ince&s;&s;antly &s;olicited to &s;ee them again&mdash;Vincent, how|ever, had found but too much cau&s;e to repent of his fir&s;t indulgence, to grant me a &s;econd.</P>
<P>"About this time a circum&s;tance occurred which promi&s;ed me a &s;peedy relea&s;e from calamity. Above a week elap&s;ed, and Vincent did not appear. My little &s;tock of provi&s;ion was exhau&s;ted, and I had been two days without food, when I again heard the doors that led to my pri&s;on creek on their hinges. An un|known &s;tep approached, and in a few minutes the mar|quis entered my cell! My blood was chilled at the &s;ight, and I clo&s;ed my eyes as I hoped for the la&s;t time. The &s;ound of his voice recalled me. His countenance was dark and &s;ullen, and I perceived that he trembled. He informed me that Vincent was no more, and that henceforward, his office, he &s;hould take upon him&s;elf. I forbore to reproach&mdash;where reproach would only have produced new &s;ufferings, and withheld &s;upplica|tion where it would have exa&s;perated con&s;cience and inflamed revenge. My knowledge of the marquis's &s;econd marriage I concealed.</P>
<P>"He u&s;ually attended me when night might be&s;t conceal his vi&s;its; though the&s;e were irregular in their return. Lately, from what motive I cannot gue&s;s, he has cea&s;ed his nocturnal vi&s;its, and comes only in the day.</P>
<P>"Once when midnight encrea&s;ed the darkne&s;s of my pri&s;on, and &s;eemed to render &s;ilence even more
<PB N="209" REF="029381_0208_0FE0D5E0007B1F88">
awful, touched by the &s;acred horrors of the hour, I poured forth my di&s;tre&s;s in loud lamentation. Oh! never can I forget what I felt, when I heard a di&s;tant voice an&s;wer to my moan! A wild &s;urpri&s;e, which was &s;trangely mingled with hope, &s;eized me, and in my fir&s;t emotion I &s;hould have an&s;wered the call, had not a recollection cro&s;&s;ed me, which bla&s;ted at once every half-rai&s;ed &s;en&s;ation of joy. I remembered the dread|ful vengeance which the marquis had &s;worn to execute upon me if I ever, by any means, endeavoured to make known the place of my concealment; and though life had long been a burden to me, I dared not to incur the certainty of being murdered. I al&s;o well knew that no per&s;on who might di&s;cover my &s;ituation could effect my enlargement; for I had no relations to de|liver me by force, and the marquis, you know, has not only power to impri&s;on, but al&s;o the right of life and death in his own domains. I, therefore, forbore to an&s;wer the call, though I could not entirely repre&s;s my lamentation. I long perplexed my&s;elf with en|deavouring to account for this &s;trange circum&s;tance, and am to this moment ignorant of its cau&s;e."</P>
<P>Julia remembering that Ferdinand had been con|&s;ined in a dungeon of the ca&s;tle, it in&s;tantly occurred to her that his pri&s;on, and that of the marchione&s;s, were not far di&s;tant; and &s;he &s;crupled not to believe that it was his voice which her mother had heard. She was right in this belief, and it was indeed the marchione&s;s who&s;e groans had formerly cau&s;ed Ferdinand &s;o much alarm, both in the marble hall of the &s;outh buildings, and in his dungeon.</P>
<P>When Julia co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">municated her opinion, and the marchione&s;s believed that &s;he had heard the voice of her &s;on&mdash;her emotion was extreme, and it was &s;ome time before &s;he could re&s;ume her narration.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="029381_0209_0FE0D5E6F08280B8">"A &s;hort time &s;ince," continued the marchione&s;s, "the marquis brought me a fortnight's provi&s;ion, and told me that I &s;hould probably &s;ee him no more till the expiration of that term. His ab&s;ence at this pe|riod you have explained in your account of the tran&s;|actions at the abbey of St. Augu&s;tin. How can I ever &s;ufficiently acknowledge the obligations I owe to my dear and invaluable friend Madame de Menon! Oh! that it might be permitted me to te&s;tify my gratitude."</P>
<P>Julia attended to the narrative of her mother in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, and gave all the &s;ympathy which &s;orrow could demand. "Surely" cried &s;he, "the providence on whom you have &s;o firmly relied, and who&s;e inflictions you have &s;upported with a fortitude &s;o noble, has conducted me through a labyrinth of misfortunes to this &s;pot, for the purpo&s;e of delivering you! Oh! let us ha&s;ten to fly this horrid abode&mdash;let us &s;eek to e&s;cape through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he cavern by which I entered."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, in earne&s;t expectation awaiting a reply. "Whither can I fly?" &s;aid the marchione&s;s, deeply &s;ighing. This que&s;tion &s;poken with the empha&s;is of de&s;pair, affected Julia to tears, and &s;he was for a while &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"The marquis," re&s;umed Julia, "would know not where to &s;eek you, or if he found you beyond his own domains, would fear to claim you. A convent may afford for the pre&s;ent a &s;afe a&s;ylum; and what|ever &s;hall happen, &s;urely no fate you may hereafter encounter can be more dreadful than the one you now experience."</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s a&s;&s;ented to the truth of this, yet her broken &s;pirits, the effect of long &s;orrow and con|finement, made her he&s;itate how to act; and there was a kind of placid de&s;pair in her look, which too faith|fully
<PB N="211" REF="029381_0210_0FE0D5EBD0206B00">
depictured her feelings. It was obvious to Julia that the cavern &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed wound beneath the range of mountains on who&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;ide &s;tood the ca&s;tle of Mazzini. The hills thus ri&s;ing, formed a &s;creen which mu&s;t entirely conceal their emergence from the mouth of the cave, and their flight&punc; from tho&s;e in the ca&s;tle. She repre&s;ented the&s;e circum&s;tances to her mother, and urged them &s;o forcibly, that the lethargy of de&s;pair yielded to hope, and the marchione&s;s com|mitted her&s;elf to the conduct of her daughter.</P>
<P>"Oh! let me lead you to light and life!" cried Julia with warm enthu&s;ia&s;m. "Surely heaven can ble&s;s me with no greater good than by making me the deliverer of my mother!" They both knelt down; and the marchione&s;s with that affecting eloquence which true piety in&s;pires, and with that confidence which had &s;upported her through &s;o many mi&s;eries, committed her&s;elf to the protection of God, and im|plored his favour on their attempt.</P>
<P>They aro&s;e, but as they conver&s;ed farther on their plan, Julia recollected that &s;he was de&s;titute of money &mdash;the banditti having robbed her of all! The &s;udden &s;hock produced by this remembrance almo&s;t &s;ubdued her &s;pirits; never till this moment had &s;he under&s;tood the value of money. But &s;he commanded her feel|ings, and re&s;olved to conceal this circum&s;tance from the marchione&s;s, preferring the chance of any evil they might encounter from without, to the certain mi&s;ery of this terrible impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Having taken what provi&s;ion the marquis had brought, they quitted the cell, and entered upon the dark pa&s;&s;age, along which they pa&s;&s;ed with cautious &s;teps. Julia came fir&s;t to the door of the cavern, but who can paint her di&s;tre&s;s when &s;he found it was fa&s;|tened! All her efforts to open it were ineffectual.&mdash;
<PB N="212" REF="029381_0211_0FE0D5F4EACFF600">
The door which had clo&s;ed after her, was held by a &s;pring lock, and could be opened on this &s;ide only with a key. When &s;he under&s;tood this circum&s;tance, the marchione&s;s, with a placid re&s;ignation which &s;eemed to exalt her above humanity, addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf again to heaven, and turned back to her cell. Here Julia indulged without re&s;erve, and without &s;cruple, the exce&s;s of her grief. The marchione&s;s wept over her. "Not for my&s;elf," &s;aid &s;he, "do I grieve,&mdash; I have too long been inured to misfortune to &s;ink under its pre&s;&s;ure. This di&s;appointment is intrin&s;ically, perhaps, little&mdash;for I had no certain refuge from cala|mity &mdash;and had it even been otherwi&s;e, a few years only of &s;uffering would have been &s;pared me. It is for you, Julia, who &s;o much lament my fate; and who in being thus delivered to the power of your father, are &s;acrificed to the duke de Luovo&mdash;that my heart &s;wells."</P>
<P>Julia could make no reply, but by pre&s;&s;ing to her lips the hand which was held forth to her. She &s;aw all the wretchedne&s;s of her &s;ituation; and her fearful uncertainty concerning Hippolitus and Ferdi|nand, formed no inferior part of her affliction.</P>
<P>"If," re&s;umed the marchione&s;s, you prefer impri|&s;onment with your mother, to a marriage with the the duke, you may &s;till &s;ecrete your&s;elf in the pa&s;&s;age we have ju&s;t quitted, and &s;hare the provi&s;ion which is brought me."</P>
<P>"O! talk not, madame, of a marriage with the duke," &s;aid Julia; "&s;urely any fate is preferable to that. But when I con&s;ider that in remaining here, I am condemned only to the &s;ufferings which my mo|ther has &s;o long endured, and that this confinement will enable me to &s;often, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ender &s;ympathy, the a&s;|perity of her misfortunes, I ought to &s;ubmit to my

pre&s;ent &s;ituation with complacency, even did a marri|age with the duke appear le&s;s hateful to me."</P>
<P>"Excellent girl!" exclaimed the marchione&s;s, cla&s;ping Julia to her bo&s;om; "the &s;ufferings you la|ment are almo&s;t repaid by this proof of your goodne&s;s and affection! Alas! that I &s;hould have been &s;o long deprived of &s;uch a daughter!"</P>
<P>Julia now endeavoured to imitate the fortitude of her mother, and tenderly concealed her anxiety for Ferdinand and Hippolitus, the idea of whom ince&s;&s;ant|ly haunted her imagination. When the marquis brought food to the cell, &s;he retired to the avenue leading to the cavern, and e&s;caped di&s;covery.</P>

<P>THE marquis, meanwhile, who&s;e indefatigable &s;earch after Julia failed of &s;ucce&s;s, was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the &s;lave of alternate pa&s;&s;ions, and he poured forth the &s;pleen of di&s;appointment on his unhappy dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s, who may now more properly be called Maria de Vellorno, inflamed, by artful in&s;inua|tions, the pa&s;&s;ions already irritated, and heightened with cruel triumph his re&s;entment towards Julia and Madame de Menon.

<P>This reproach &s;tung to the very &s;oul of the marquis; he felt all its force, and was at the &s;ame time con&s;cious of his inability to obviate it. The effect of his crimes now fell in &s;evere puni&s;hment upon his own head. The threatened &s;ecret, which was no other than the im|pri&s;onment of the marchione&s;s, arre&s;ted his arm of vengeance, and compelled him to &s;ubmit to in&s;ult and di&s;appointment. But the reproach of Maria &s;unk deep in his mind; it fomented his pride into redoubled fury, and he now repelled with di&s;dain the idea of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He revolved the means which might effect his pur|po&s;e &mdash;he &s;aw but one&mdash;this was the death of the mar|chione&s;s.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ion of one crime often requires the per|petration of another. When once we enter on the labyrinth of vice, we can &s;eldom return, but are led on through corre&s;pondent mazes to de&s;truction. To ob|viate the effect of his fir&s;t crime, it was now nece&s;&s;ary the marquis &s;hould commit a &s;econd, and conceal the <HI>impri&s;onment</HI> of the marchione&s;s by her <HI>murder.</HI> Him|&s;elf the only living witne&s;s of her exi&s;tence, when &s;he was removed, the allegations of the <HI>Padre Abate</HI> would by this means be un&s;upported by any proof, and he might then boldly appeal to the pope for the re&s;to|ration of his child.</P>
<P>He mu&s;ed upon his &s;cheme, and the more he accu&s;|tomed his mind to contemplate it, the le&s;s &s;crupulous he became. The crime from which he would former|ly have &s;hrunk, he now &s;urveyed with a &s;teady eye. The fury of his pa&s;&s;ions, unaccu&s;tomed to re&s;i&s;tance, uniting with the force of what ambition termed ne|ce&s;&s;ity &mdash;urged him to the deed, and he determined up|on
<PB N="215" REF="029381_0214_0FE0D6070BA82180">
the murder of his wife. The means of effecting his purpo&s;e were ea&s;y and various; but as he was not yet &s;o entirely hardened as to be able to view her dy|ing pangs, and embrue his own hands in her blood, he cho&s;e to di&s;patch her by means of poi&s;on, which he re|&s;olved to mingle in her food.</P>
<P>But a new affliction was preparing for the marquis, which attacked him where he was mo&s;t vulnerable; and the veil which had &s;o long over&s;hadowed his rea|&s;on was now to be removed. He was informed by Bapti&s;ta of the infidelity of Maria de Vellorno. In the fir&s;t emotion of pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;purned the informer from his pre&s;ence, and di&s;dained to believe the circum&s;tance. A little reflexion changed the object of his re&s;entment; he recalled the &s;ervant, who&s;e faithfulne&s;s he had no rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t, and conde&s;cended to interrogate him on the &s;ubject of his misfortune.</P>
<P>He learned that an intimacy had for &s;ome time &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between Maria and the cavalier de Vincini; and that the a&s;&s;ignation was u&s;ually held at the pavillion on the &s;ea &s;hore, in an evening. Bapti&s;ta farther declar|ed, that if the marquis de&s;ired a confirmation of his words, he might obtain it by vi&s;iting this &s;pot at the hour mentioned.</P>
<P>This information lighted up the wilde&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of his nature; his former &s;ufferings faded away before the &s;tronger influence of the pre&s;ent misfortune, and it &s;eemed as if he had never ta&s;ted mi&s;ery till now. To &s;u&s;pect the wife upon whom he doated with romantic fondne&s;s, on whom he had centered all his firme&s;t hopes of happine&s;s, and for who&s;e &s;ake he had committed the crime which embittered even his pre&s;ent moments, and which would involve him in &s;till deeper guilt&mdash;to find <HI>her</HI> ungrateful to his love, and a traitore&s;s to his ho|nour&mdash;produced a mi&s;ery more poignant than any his

imagination had conceived. He was torn by con|tending pa&s;&s;ions, and oppo&s;ite re&s;olutions:&mdash;now he re&s;olved to expiate her guilt with her blood&mdash;and now he melted in all the &s;oftne&s;s of love. Vengeance and honour bade him &s;trike to the heart which had betrayed him, and urged him in&s;tantly to the deed&mdash;when the idea of her beauty&mdash;her winning &s;miles&mdash;her fond en|dearments &s;tole upon his fancy, and &s;ubdued his heart; he almo&s;t wept to the idea of injuring her, and in &s;pite of appearances, pronounced her faithful. The &s;uc|ceeding moments plunged him again in uncertainty; his tortures acquired new vigour from ce&s;&s;ation, and again he experienced all the phrenzy of de&s;pair. He was now re&s;olved to end his doubts by repairing to the pavillion; but again his heart wavered in irre&s;olution how to proceed &s;hould his fears be confirmed. In the mean time he determined to watch the behaviour of Maria with &s;evere vigilance.</P>
<P>They met at dinner, and he ob&s;erved her clo&s;ely, but di&s;covered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t the &s;malle&s;t impropriety in her con|duct. Her &s;miles and her beauty again wound their fa&s;cinations round his heart, and in the exce&s;s of their influence he was almo&s;t tempted to repair the injury which his late &s;u&s;picions had done her, by confe&s;&s;ing them at her feet. The appearance of the cavalier de Vincini, however, renewed his &s;u&s;picions; his heart throbbed wildly, and with re&s;tle&s;s impatience he watch|ed the return of evening, which would remove his &s;u&s;|pence.</P>
<P>Night at length came. He repaired to the pavillion, and &s;ecreted him&s;elf among the trees that embowered it. Many minutes had not pa&s;&s;ed, when he heard a &s;ound of low whi&s;pering voices &s;teal from among the trees, and foot-&s;teps approaching down the alley. He
<PB N="217" REF="029381_0216_0FE0D612C60FD1A0">
&s;tood almo&s;t petrified with terrible &s;en&s;ations, and pre|&s;ently heard &s;ome per&s;ons enter the pavillion. The marquis now emerged from his hiding place; a faint light i&s;&s;ued from the building. He &s;tole to the win|dow, and beheld within, Maria and the cavalier de Vincini. Fired at the &s;ight, he drew his &s;word, and &s;prang forward. The &s;ound of his &s;tep alarmed the cavalier, who, on perceiving the marquis, ru&s;hed by him from the pavillion, and di&s;appeared among the woods. The marquis pur&s;ued, but could not overtake him; and he returned to the pavillion with an inten|tion of plunging his &s;word in the heart of Maria, when he di&s;covered her &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the ground. Pity now &s;u&s;pended his vengeance; he pau&s;ed in agonizing gaze upon her, and returned his &s;word into the &s;cabbard.</P>
<P>She revived, but on ob&s;erving the marquis, &s;cream|ed and relap&s;ed. He ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; inventing, to conceal his di&s;grace, &s;ome pre|tence for her &s;udden illne&s;s, and &s;he was conveyed to her chamber.</P>
<P>The marquis was now not &s;uffered to doubt her in|fidelity, but the pa&s;&s;ion which her conduct abu&s;ed, her faithle&s;sne&s;s could not &s;ubdue; he &s;till doated, with ab&s;urd fondne&s;s, and even regretted that uncer|tainty could no longer flatter him with hope. It &s;eem|ed as if his de&s;ire of her affection encrea&s;ed with his knowledge of the lo&s;s of it; and the very circum|&s;tance which &s;hould have rou&s;ed his aver&s;ion, by a &s;trange perver&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ition, appeared to heighten his pa&s;&s;ion, and to make him think it impo&s;&s;ible he could exi&s;t without her.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t energy of his indignation was &s;ub|&s;ided, he determined, therefore, to reprove and to pun|i&s;h, but hereafter to re&s;tore her to favour.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="029381_0217_0FE0D61751FAB8E0">In this re&s;olution he went to her apartment, and re|prehended her fal&s;ehood in terms of ju&s;t indignation.</P>
<P>Maria de Vellorno, in whom the late di&s;covery had rou&s;ed re&s;entment, in&s;tead of awakening penitence, had exa&s;perated pride without exciting &s;hame, heard the upbraidings of the marquis with impatience, and re|plied to them with acrimonious violence.</P>
<P>She boldly a&s;&s;erted her innocence, and in&s;tantly in|vented a &s;tory, the plau&s;ibility of which might have de|ceived a man who had evidence le&s;s certain than his &s;en&s;es to contradict it. She behaved with a haughti|ne&s;s the mo&s;t in&s;olent; and when &s;he perceived that the marquis was no longer to be mi&s;led, and that her violence failed to accompli&s;h its purpo&s;e, &s;he had re|cour&s;e to tears and &s;upplications. But the artifice was too glaring to &s;ucceed; and the marquis quitted her apartment in an agony of re&s;entment.</P>
<P>His former fa&s;cinations, however, quickly returned, and again held him in &s;u&s;pen&s;ion between love and vengeance. That the vehemence of his pa&s;&s;ion how|ever, might not want an object, he ordered Bapti&s;ta to di&s;cover the retreat of the cavalier de Vincini, on whom he meant to revenge his lo&s;t honour. Shame forbade him to employ others in the &s;earch.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery &s;u&s;pended for a while the operations of that fatal &s;cheme, which had before employed the thoughts of the marquis; but it had only &s;u&s;pended&mdash; not de&s;troyed them. The late occurrence had anni|hilated his dome&s;tic happine&s;s; but his pride now ro&s;e to re&s;cue him from de&s;pair, and he centered all his fu|ture hopes upon ambition. In a moment of cool re|flexion, he con&s;idered that he had derived neither hap|pine&s;s nor content from the pur&s;uit of di&s;&s;ipated plea|&s;ures, to which he had hitherto &s;acrificed every op|po&s;ing con&s;ideration. He re&s;olved, therefore, to aban|don
<PB N="219" REF="029381_0218_0FE0D61DADD93A78">
the gay &s;chemes of di&s;&s;ipation which had former|ly allured him, and dedicate him&s;elf entirely to ambi|tion, in the pur&s;uits and delights of which he hoped to bury all his cares. He therefore became more earne&s;t than ever for the marriage of Julia with the duke de Luovo, through who&s;e means he de&s;igned to involve him&s;elf in the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, and determined to recover her at whatever con&s;equence. He re&s;olved without further delay to appeal to the pope; but to do this with &s;afety, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the marchio|ne&s;s &s;hould die; and he returned therefore to the con|&s;ideration and execution of his diabolical purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He mingled a poi&s;onous drug with the food he de|&s;igned for her; and when night arrived, carried it to the cell. As he unlocked the door, his hand trembled; and when he pre&s;ented the food, and looked con&s;ciou&s;|ly for the la&s;t time upon the marchione&s;s, who receiv|ed it with humble thankfulne&s;s, his heart almo&s;t re|lented. His countenance, over which was diffu&s;ed the palene&s;s of death, expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ecret movements of his &s;oul, and he gazed upon her with eyes of &s;tiffen|ed horror. Alarmed by his looks, &s;he fell upon her knees to &s;upplicate his pity.</P>
<P>Her attitude recalled his bewildered &s;en&s;es; and en|deavouring to a&s;&s;ume a tranquil a&s;pect, he bade her ri&s;e, and in&s;tantly quitted the cell, fearful of the in|&s;tability of his purpo&s;e. His mind was not yet &s;uf|ficiently hardened by guilt to repel the arrows of con|&s;cience, and his imagination re&s;ponded to her power. As he pa&s;&s;ed through the long dreary pa&s;&s;ages from the pri&s;on, &s;olemn and my&s;terious &s;ounds &s;eemed to &s;peak in every murmur of the bla&s;t which crept along their windings, and he often &s;tarted and looked back.</P>
<P>He reached his chamber, and having &s;hut the door, &s;urveyed the room in fearful examination. Ideal

forms flitted before his fancy, and for the fir&s;t time in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is life he feared to be alone. Shame only with held him from calling Bapti&s;ta. The gloom of the hour, and the death-like &s;ilence that prevailed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the horrors of his imagination. He half repented of the deed, yet deemed it now too late to obviate it; and he threw him&s;elf on his bed in terrible emotion. His head grew dizzy, and a &s;udden faintne&s;s overcame him; he he&s;itated, and a length aro&s;e to ring for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, but found him&s;elf unable to &s;tand.</P>
<P>In a few moments he was &s;omewhat revived, and rang his bell; but before any per&s;on appeared, he was &s;eized with terrible pains, and &s;taggering to his bed, &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon it.

Emilia amid the general alarm came to her father's room&punc; but the &s;ight of him overcame her, and &s;he was carried from his pre&s;ence.

The mar|quis now beckoned his attendants to quit the room, and they were preparing to obey, when a violent noi&s;e was heard from without; almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant
<PB N="221" REF="029381_0220_0FE0D6281F89E9E0">
the door of the apartment was thrown open, and the &s;ervant who had been &s;ent for the marchione&s;s, ru&s;hed in. His look alone declared the horror of his mind, for words he had none to utter. He &s;tared wildly, and pointed to the gallery he had quitted. Ferdinand, &s;eized with new terror, ru&s;hed the way he pointed to the apartment of the marchione&s;s. A &s;pectacle of hor|ror pre&s;ented it&s;elf, Maria lay on a couch lifele&s;s, and bathed in blood. A poignard, the in&s;trument of her de&s;truction, was on the floor; and it appeared from a letter which was found on the couch be&s;ide her, that &s;he had died by her own hand. The paper con|contained the&s;e words:
<LETTER>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>MARIA DE MAZZINI.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>It now appeared that the marquis was poi&s;oned by the vengeance of the woman for whom he had re&s;igned his con&s;cience. The con&s;ternation and di&s;tre&s;s of Fer|dinand cannot ea&s;ily be conceived: he ha&s;tened back to his father's chamber, but determined to conceal the dreadful cata&s;trophe of Maria de Vellorno. This pre|caution, however, was u&s;ele&s;s; for the &s;ervants, in the con&s;ternation of terror, had revealed it, and the mar|quis had fainted.</P>
<P>Returning pains recalled his &s;en&s;es, and the agonies he &s;uffered were too &s;hocking for the beholders. Me|dical endeavours were applied, but the poi&s;on was too
<PB N="222" REF="029381_0221_0FE0D62CA72AEE88">
powerful for antidote. The marquis's pains at length &s;ub&s;ided; the poi&s;on had exhau&s;ted mo&s;t of its rage, and he became tolerably ea&s;y. He waved his hand for the attendants to leave the room; and beckoning to Ferdinand, who&s;e &s;en&s;es were almo&s;t &s;tunned by this accumulation of horror, bade him &s;it down be&s;ide him. "The hand of death is now upon me," &s;aid he; "I would employ the&s;e la&s;t moments in revealing a deed, which is more dreadful to me than all the bo|dily agonies I &s;uffer. It will be &s;ome relief to me to di&s;cover it." Ferdinand gra&s;ped the hand of the mar|quis in &s;peechle&s;s terror. "The retribution of hea|ven is upon me," re&s;umed the marquis. "My puni&s;hment is the immediate con&s;equence of my guilt. Heaven has made that woman the in&s;trument of its ju&s;tice, whom I made the in&s;trument of my crimes;&mdash; that woman for who&s;e &s;ake I forgot con&s;cience, and braved vice&mdash;for whom I impri&s;oned an innocent wife, and afterwards murdered her."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words every nerve of Ferdinand thrilled; he let go the marquis's hand, and &s;tarted back. "Look not &s;o fiercely on me," &s;aid the marquis, in a hallow voice; "your eyes &s;trike death to my &s;oul; my con&s;cience needs not this additional pang." "My mother!" exclaimed Ferdinand&mdash;"my mother! Speak, tell me"&mdash;"I have no breath," &s;aid the marquis. "Oh! &mdash;Take the&s;e keys&mdash;the &s;outh tower&mdash;the trap-door.&mdash;"Tis po&s;&s;ible&mdash;Oh&mdash;"</P>
<P>The marquis made a &s;udden &s;pring upwards, and fell lifele&s;s on the bed. The attendants were called in, but he was gone for ever. His la&s;t words &s;truck with the force of lightning upon the mind of Ferdi|nand; they &s;eemed to &s;ay that his mother might yet exi&s;t. He took the keys; and ordering &s;ome of the &s;ervants to follow, ha&s;tened to the &s;outhern building;
<PB N="223" REF="029381_0222_0FE0D6320FFA5CD0">
he proceeded to the tower, and the trap-door beneath the &s;tair-ca&s;e was lifted. They all de&s;cended into a dark pa&s;&s;age, which conducted them through &s;everal intricacies to the door of the cell. Ferdinand in trem|bling horrible expectation, applied the key; the door opened, and he entered&mdash;but what was his &s;urpri&s;e when he found no per&s;on in the cell! He concluded that he had mi&s;taken the place, and quitted it for farther &s;earch; but having followed the windings of the pa&s;&s;age, by which he entered, without di&s;cover|ing any other door, he returned to a more exact ex|amination of the cell. He now ob&s;erved the door whichled to the cavern, and he entered upon the avenue, but no per&s;on was found there, and no voice an&s;wered to his call. Having reached the door of the cavern, which was fa&s;tened&punc; he returned lo&s;t in grief, and me|ditating upon the la&s;t words of the marquis. He now thought that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mi&s;taken their import, and that the words '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;ible, were not meant to apply to the life of the marchione&s;s. He concluded that the murder had been committed at a di&s;tant period; and he re&s;olved, therefore, to have the ground of the cell dug up, and the remains of his mother &s;ought for.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t violence of the emotions excited by the late &s;cenes was &s;ub&s;ided, he inquired concerning Maria de Vellorno.</P>
<P>It appeared that on the day preceding this horrid tran&s;action, the marquis had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in her apartment; that they were heard in loud di&s;pute;&mdash; that the pa&s;&s;ion of the Marquis grew high;&mdash;that he upbraided her with her pa&s;t conduct, and threate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed her with a formal &s;eparation. When the marquis quitted her &s;he was heard walking quick through the room, in a pa&s;&s;ion of tears, &s;he often &s;uddenly &s;topped in vehement but incoherent exclamation; and at la&s;t
<PB N="224" REF="029381_0223_0FE0D638217C8668">
threw her&s;elf on the floor, and was for &s;ome time en|tirely &s;till. Here her woman found her, upon who&s;e en|trance &s;he aro&s;e ha&s;tily, and reproved her for appearing uncalled. After this &s;he remained &s;ilent and &s;ullen.</P>
<P>She de&s;cended to &s;upper, where the marquis met her alone at table. Little was &s;aid during the repa&s;t, at the conclu&s;ion of which the &s;ervants were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and it was believed that during the interval between &s;upper, and the hour of repo&s;e, Maria de Vellorno contrived to mingle poi&s;on with the wine of the marquis. How &s;he had procured this poi&s;on was never di&s;covered.</P>
<P>She retired early to her chamber; and her woman ob&s;erving that &s;he appeared much agitated, inquired if &s;he was ill. To this &s;he returned a &s;hort an&s;wer in the negative, and her woman was &s;oon afterwards di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed. But &s;he had hardly &s;hut the door of the room, when &s;he heard her lady's voice recalling her. She returned, and received &s;ome trifling order, and ob&s;erved that Maria looked uncommonly pale; there was be|&s;ides, a wildne&s;s in her eyes which frightened her, but &s;he did not dare to a&s;k any que&s;tions. She again quit|ted the room, and had only reached the extremity of the gallery, when her mi&s;tre&s;s's bell rang. She ha&s;tened back. Maria inquired if the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quis was gone to bed, and if all was quiet. Being an&s;wered in the affirmative, &s;he replied, "This is a &s;till hour, and a dark one!&mdash;Good night!"</P>
<P>Her woman having once more left the room, &s;top|ped at the door to li&s;ten; but all within remaining &s;i|lent, &s;he retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is probable that Maria perpetrated the fatal act &s;oon after the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of her woman; for when &s;he was found two hours afterwards, &s;he appeared to have been dead &s;ome time. On examination, a wound was di&s;covered on her left &s;ide, which had doubtle&s;s pene|trated
<PB N="225" REF="029381_0224_0FE0D63D9453C7F8">
to the heart, from the &s;uddenne&s;s of her death, and from the effu&s;ion of blood which had followed.</P>
<P>The&s;e terrible events &s;o deeply affected Emilia, that &s;he was confined to her bed by a dangerous illne&s;s. Ferdinand &s;truggled again&s;t the &s;hock with manly for|titude. But amid all the tumult of the pre&s;ent &s;cenes, his uncertainty concerning Julia, whom he had left in the hands of banditti, and whom he had been with|held from &s;eeking or re&s;cuing, formed perhaps the mo&s;t affecting part of his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The late marquis de Mazzini, and Maria de Vellor|no, were interred with the honour due to their rank in the church of the convent of St. Nicolo. Their lives exhibited a boundle&s;s indulgence of violent and luxurious pa&s;&s;ions, and their deaths marked the con&s;e|quences of &s;uch indulgence, and held forth to man|kind a &s;ingular in&s;tance of divine vengeance.</P>

<P>IN turning up the ground of the cell, it was di&s;co|vered that it communicated with the dungeon in which Ferdinand had been confined, and where he had heard tho&s;e groans which occa&s;ioned him &s;o much terror.</P>
<P>The &s;tory which the marquis formerly related to his &s;on concerning the &s;outhern buildings, it was now evi|dent was fabricated for the purpo&s;e of concealing the impri&s;onment of the marchione&s;s.

It &s;erved al&s;o to explain by &s;uper|natural evidence the cau&s;e of tho&s;e &s;ounds, and of that appearance which had been there ob&s;erved, but which were in reality occa&s;ioned only by the marquis.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="029381_0225_0FE0D641151D26C0">The event of the examination in the cell threw Fer|dinand into new perplexity. The marquis had con|fe&s;&s;ed that he poi&s;oned his wife&mdash;yet her remains were not to be found; and the place which he &s;igni|fied to be that of her confinement, bore no ve&s;tige of her having been there. There appeared no way by which &s;he could have e&s;caped from her pri&s;on; for both the door which opened upon the cell, and that which terminated the avenue beyond, were fa&s;tened when tried by Ferdinand.</P>
<P>But the young marquis had no time for u&s;ele&s;s &s;pe|culation&mdash;&s;erious duties called upon him. He believed that Julia was &s;till in the power of banditti; and on the conclu&s;ion of his father's funeral, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;et forward him&s;elf to Palermo to give informatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the abode of the robbers, and to repair with the officers of ju&s;|tice, accompanied by a part of his own people, to the re&s;cue of his &s;i&s;ter. On his arrival at Palermo he was informed that a banditti, who&s;e retreat had been among the ruins of a mona&s;tery, &s;ituated in the fore&s;t of Marentino, was already di&s;covered; that their abode had been &s;earched; and them&s;elves &s;ecured for examples of public ju&s;tice&mdash;but that no captive lady had been found among&s;t them. This latter intelli|gence excited in Ferdinand a very &s;erious di&s;tre&s;s, and he was wholly unable to conjecture her fate. He ob|tained leave, however, to interrogate tho&s;e of the robbers, who were impri&s;oned at Palermo, but could draw from them no &s;atisfactory or certain information.</P>
<P>At length he quitted Palermo for the fore&s;t of Ma|rentino, thinking it po&s;&s;ible that Julia might be heard of in its neighbourhood. He travelled on in melan|choly and dejection, and evening overtook him long before he reached the place of his de&s;tination. The night came on heavily in clouds, and a violent &s;torm of wind and rain aro&s;e. The road lay through a wild
<PB N="227" REF="029381_0226_0FE0D646DB16D080">
and rocky country, and Ferdinand could obtain no &s;helter. His attendants offered him their cloaks, but he refu&s;ed to expo&s;e a &s;ervant to the hard&s;hip he would not him&s;elf endure. He travelled for &s;ome miles in a heavy rain; and the wind, which howled mournfully among the rocks, and who&s;e &s;olemn pau&s;es were fill|ed by the di&s;tant ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings of the &s;ea, heightened the de&s;olation of the &s;cene. At length he di&s;cerned amid the darkne&s;s from a far, a red light waving in the wind; it varied with the bla&s;t, but never totally di&s;|appeared. He pu&s;hed his hor&s;es into a gallop, and made towards it.</P>
<P>The flame continued to direct his cour&s;e; and on a nearer approach, he perceived by the red reflexion of its fires, &s;treaming a long radiance upon the waters beneath&mdash;a light-hou&s;e &s;ituated upon a point of rock which over-hung the &s;ea. He knocked for admittance, and the door was opened by an old man, who bade him welcome.</P>
<P>Within appeared a cheerful blazing fire, round which were &s;eated &s;everal per&s;ons, who &s;eemed like him&s;elf to have &s;ought &s;helter from the tempe&s;t of the night. The &s;ight of the fire cheered him, and he ad|vanced towards it, when a &s;udden &s;cream &s;eized his attention; the company ro&s;e up in confu&s;ion, and in the &s;ame in&s;tant he di&s;covered Julia and Hippolitus. The joy of that moment is not to be de&s;cribed, but his attention was quickly called off from his own &s;itu|ation to that of a lady, who during the general tran&s;|port had fainted. His &s;en&s;at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns on learning &s;he was his mother can only be conceived.</P>
<P>She revived. "My &s;on!" &s;aid &s;he, in a languid voice, as &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him to her heart. "Great God, I am recompen&s;ed! Surely this moment may repay a life of mi&s;ery!" He could only receive her care&s;&s;es in &s;ilence; but the &s;udden tears which &s;tarted in his
<PB N="228" REF="029381_0227_0FE0B73B07B03360">
eyes, &s;poke a language too expre&s;&s;ive to be mi&s;under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t emotion of the &s;cene was pa&s;&s;ed, Ju|lia inquired by what means Ferdinand had come to this &s;pot. He an&s;wered her generally, and avoided for the pre&s;ent entering upon the affecting &s;ubject of the late events at the ca&s;tle of Mazzini. Julia related the hi&s;tory of her adventures &s;ince &s;he parted with her brother. In her narration it appeared that Hippoli|tus, who was taken by the duke de Luovo, at the mouth of the cave, had afterwards e&s;caped, and re|turned to the cavern in &s;earch of Julia. The low re|ce&s;s in the rock, through which Julia had pa&s;&s;ed, he perceived by the light of his flambeau. He pene|trated to the cavern beyond, and from thence to the pri&s;on of the marchione&s;s. No colour of language can paint the &s;cene which followed; it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that the whole party agreed to quit the cell at the re|turn of night. But this being a night on which it was known the marquis would vi&s;it the pri&s;on, they agreed to defer their departure till after his appearance, and thus elude the danger to be expected from an early di&s;covery of the e&s;cape of the marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of foot&s;teps above, Hippolitus and Julia had &s;ecreted them&s;elves in the avenue; and im|mediately on the marquis's departure they all repaired to the cavern, leaving in the hurry of their flight, un|touched, the poi&s;onous food he had brought. Having e&s;caped from thence they proceeded to a neighbouring village, where hor&s;es were procured to carry them to|wards Palermo. Here after a tedious journey they arrived, in the de&s;ign of embarking for Italy. Con|trary winds had detained them till the day on which Ferdinand left that city, when apprehen&s;ive and weary of delay, they hired a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and determined to
<PB N="229" REF="029381_0228_0FE0D65205F8DEA0">
brave the winds. They had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent their temerity; for the ve&s;&s;el had not been long at &s;ea when the &s;torm aro&s;e, which threw them back upon the &s;hores of Sicily, and brought them to the light|hou&s;e, where they were di&s;covered by Ferdinand.</P>
<P>On the following morning Ferdinand returned with his friends to Palermo, where he fir&s;t di&s;clo&s;ed the late fatal events of the Ca&s;tle. They now &s;ettled their fu|ture plans; and Ferdinand ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle of Mazzini to fetch Emilia, and to give orders for the re|moval of his hou&s;ehold to his palace at Naples, where he de&s;igned to fix his future re&s;idence. The di&s;tre&s;s of Emilia, whom he found recovered from her indi&s;po&s;i|tion, yielded to joy and wonder, when &s;he heard of the exi&s;tence of her mother, and the &s;afety of her &s;i&s;ter. She departed with Ferdinand for Palermo, where her friends awaited her, and where the joy of the meeting was con&s;iderably heightened by the appearance of Ma|dame de Menon, for whom the marchione&s;s had di&s;|patched a me&s;&s;enger to St. Augu&s;tin's. Madame had quitted the abbey for another convent, to which how|ever the me&s;&s;enger was directed. This happy party now embarked for Naples.</P>
<P>From this period the ca&s;tle of Mazzini, which had been the theatre of a dreadful cata&s;trophe, and who&s;e &s;cenes would have revived in the minds of the chief per&s;onages connected with it, painful and &s;hocking re|collections&mdash;was abandoned.</P>
<P>On their arrival at Naples, Ferdinand pre&s;ented to the king a clear and &s;atisfactory account of the late events at the ca&s;tle, in con&s;equence of which the mar|chione&s;s was confirmed in her rank, and Ferdinand was received as the the &s;ixth marquis de Mazzini.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s, thus re&s;tored to the world, and to happine&s;s, re&s;ided with her children in the palace at Naples, where after time had &s;omewhat mellowed the
<PB N="230" REF="029381_0229_0FE0D65604070D38">
remembrance of the late calamity, the nuptials of Hip|politus and Julia were celebrated. The recollection of the difficulties they had encountered, and of the di&s;|tre&s;s they had endured for each other, now &s;erved only to heighten by contra&s;t the happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent period.</P>
<P>Ferdinand &s;oon after accepted a command in the Neapolitan army; and amid&s;t the many heroes of that warlike and turbulent age, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for his valour and ability. The occupations of war engaged his mind, while his heart was occupied in promoting the happine&s;s of his family.</P>
<P>Madame de Menon, who&s;e generous attachment to the marchione&s;s had been fully proved, found in the re|&s;toration of her friend a living witne&s;s of her marri|age, and thus recovered tho&s;e e&s;tates which had been unju&s;tly with-held from her. But the marchione&s;s and her family, grateful to her friend&s;hip, and attach|ed to her virtues, prevailed upon her to &s;pend the re|mainder of her life at the palace of Mazzini.</P>
<P>Emilia, wholly attached to her family, continued to re&s;ide with the marchione&s;s, who &s;aw her race renewed in the children of Hippolitus and Julia. Thus &s;ur|rounded by her children and friends, and engaged in forming the minds of the infant generation, &s;he &s;eemed to forget that &s;he had ever been otherwi&s;e than happy."</P>
<P>Here the manu&s;cript annals conclude. In review|ing this &s;tory, we perceive a &s;ingular and &s;triking in|&s;tance of moral retribution. We learn al&s;o, that tho&s;e who do only THAT WHICH IS RIGHT, endure nothing in misfortune but a trial of their virtue, and from trials well endured, derive the &s;ure&s;t claim to the protection of heaven.</P>
