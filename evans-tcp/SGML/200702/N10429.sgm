<P N="20">20. Whether the &s;upreme legi&s;lative au|thority of every nation does not nece&s;&s;arily extend to all the dominions of that nation; and whether any place, to which this au|thority does not extend, can ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be a part of its dominions?</P>
<P N="21">21. Whether, in con&s;equence of a general grant, particular claims, founded upon par|tial con&s;tructions and remote inferences, which are contrary to the apparent intere&s;t and de&s;ign of the granter, can be valid, either in law or in equity?</P>
<P N="22">22. Whether any <HI>direct</HI> evidence has hi|therto appeared in favour of the exemption for which the colonies contend; and whe|ther it does not concern the managers of their cau&s;e, previou&s;ly to any other &s;teps, to produce <HI>&s;uch</HI> evidence in &s;upport of their claim?</P>

<P N="24">24. Whether, &s;uppo&s;ing this to have been really intended, it was in the power of the crown to alienate any part of its dominions, without the adivce and con&s;ent of parlia|ment?</P>
<P N="25">25. Whether the above &s;uppo&s;ition does not imply, that the executive power is able at plea&s;ure, to annul, alter, or re&s;train the legi&s;lative power, which is the greate&s;t ab|&s;urdity?</P>
<P N="26">26. Whether the exemption contended for be not incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of dependent colonies, and compatible only with the idea of independent &s;tates?</P>
<P N="27">27. Whether a right in the colonies to choo&s;e which laws of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> they will obey, and which they will di&s;obey, would leave any obligation to obedience at all?</P>

<P N="37">37. Whether, in the new charter, which was granted them by <HI>William and Mary,</HI> and under which they have been governed to the pre&s;ent year, the power of levying taxes is not re&s;trained altogether to provincial and local purpo&s;es, and allowed to be exerci&s;ed over &s;uch only as are <HI>inhabitants</HI> and <HI>propri|etors</HI> in the province, &s;o that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>

<P N="40">40. Whether the charters granted by Charles the Second, to the inhabitants of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> are more than bare charters of incorporation, erecting them re&s;pectively into corporate bodies, and empowering them to perform corpo|rate acts, in the &s;ame manner, &s;ay the char|ters, <Q>as <HI>other</HI> our liege people of <HI>this our realm of</HI> England, or any other corpora|tion,

<P N="42">42.

<P N="43">43. Whether the u&s;e of the great &s;eal of <HI>England,</HI> in ratifying the grants above|mentioned, does not prove that, in each

<P N="54">54. Whether it was not then allowed by the public advocates for <HI>American</HI> liber|ty, that the parliament had a right to re|gulate the trade of the colonies, and to lay duties both on their imports and ex|ports<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The very re&s;pectable author of a leading pamphlet in tho&s;e times, entitled, <HI>Con&s;iderations on the propriety of im|po&s;ing taxes,</HI> &amp;c. declares his opinion in the following words. <Q>The &s;ubordination of the colonies, and the au|thority of the parliament to pre&s;erve it, have been fully acknowledged. Not only the welfare, but perhaps the exi&s;tence of the mother country, as an independent king|dom, may depend upon her trade and navigation, and the&s;e (may depend) &s;o far upon her intercour&s;e with the colonies, that, if it &s;hould be neglected, there would &s;oon be an end to that commerce, whence her greate&s;t wealth is derived, and upon which her maritime power is principally founded. From the&s;e con&s;idera|tions, the right of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament, to regulate the trade of the colonies, may be ju&s;tly deduced; a de|nial of it would contradict the admi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubordi|nation, and of the authority to pre&s;erve it; re&s;ulting from the nature of the relation between the mother-country and her colonies. It is a common, and frequently <HI>the mo&s;t proper method to regulate trade by duties on imports and exports.</HI> The authority of the mother-country to regu|late the trade of the colonies being unque&s;tionable, what regulations are mo&s;t proper, are to be of cour&s;e &s;ub|mitted to the determination of the parliament; and if an <HI>incidental revenue</HI> &s;hould be produced by &s;uch regu|lations, the&s;e are not therefore unwarrantable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A right to impo&s;e an internal tax on the colonies, without their coment, <HI>for the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of a revenue,</HI> is denied; a right to regulate their trade. <HI>without their con&s;ent,</HI> is admitted. The impo&s;ition of a duty may, in &s;ome in&s;tances, be the <HI>proper</HI> regulation. If the claims of the mother-country and the colonies &s;hould &s;eem on &s;uch an occa&s;ion to interfere, and the point of right to be doubtful (which I take to be otherwi&s;e) it is ea&s;y to gue&s;s that the determination will be on the &s;ide of pow|er, and that the inferior will be con&s;trained to &s;ubmit.</Q></P>
<P>The worthy author of the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania Farmer's Letters.</HI> &s;ays, <Q>The parliament unque&s;tionably po&s;&s;e&s;t a <HI>legal au|thority</HI> to regulate the trade of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>all her colonies:</HI> Such an authority is e&s;&s;ential to the relation be|tween a mother-country and her colonies, and nece&s;&s;ary for the common good of all.
