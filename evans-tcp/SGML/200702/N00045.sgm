<P>M<HI>ight I have had mine own choice, and desires granted, some other should have performed the task of a</HI> Preface <HI>to the following</HI> Trea|tise <HI>of my precious and much Honoured Father; but being put upon it, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> worthy friends, whom I knew not how to deny, I shall therefore humbly promise a word or two, in tenderness to the Truth, and out of un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> love to these especially of Christ's poor sheep (how ever feeble, or di|seased) that either have been, or may be in danger of going astray from so great a Truth, as is the subject of the ensuing discourse: being sincere|ly desirous, that they may be restored, and from thence returned unto the Shepherd, and Bishop of our Soules, and may in nothing be made a prey to him, who is our great adversary, the Devil, who walketh about, seeking whom be may devour.</HI> For we should not be ignorant of his devices.</P>
<P>The enmity put by the Lord between the <HI>seed of the Woman</HI> and <HI>the seed of the Serpent, Gen.</HI> 3. 15. soon began to work, even in the infancy of the Church, in the family of our first Parents, as we see <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. by the Martyrdome of <HI>righteous Abel.</HI> No small portion of that fixed hatred, and hostility of the <HI>old Serpent,</HI> hath ever since been discovered against the young ones of Christs little flock. The multiplication of the Children of Israel, is the occasion why <HI>Pharaoh</HI> deals <HI>so wisely</HI> as we read; endeavouring first by the <HI>Midwives,</HI> secret|ly to destroy the <HI>male Children:</HI> and after that, more openly by an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to <HI>drown them</HI> in his Egyptian waters; for which what ever his pretence might be, alleadged <HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> 1. 10. yet no doubt (as <HI>Calvin</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> place somewhat that way hint's) Satan had a design there|in, to cut of the name and posterity <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Abraham</HI> (who is the Father <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them that beleive,</HI> even of US all <HI>the Father of many nations, Rom.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, 16, 17.) and so to evacuate, and annihilate the promise of God, even that great promise of his everlasting Covenant, to be a God to him, and to his seed for ever, in their Generations.

That Children of Godly Parents come to the <HI>fruition</HI> of their Membership by their Parents Covenant, but that which give's them their <HI>right,</HI> and interest in this Membership is Gods Covenant, whereby he engageth himselfe equally to be a <HI>God to them, and to their Seed.</HI> This I suppose is clear.</P>
<P N="2">2. That according to the double <HI>Seed,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 1. <HI>Elect Seed.</HI> 2. <HI>Church-Seed;</HI> So there is a double Covenant, 1. <HI>External and out|ward:</HI> 2. <HI>Internall and inward.</HI> And because the Covenant makes the Church, hence there is an inward, and outward Membership, and Church estate: there is an <HI>outward Jew,</HI> &amp; an <HI>inward Jew, Rom.</HI> 2. 28, 29. All are not <HI>Israel</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> the elect Seed) that are of <HI>Israel</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Church-Seed or in outward Covenant) to whom the Apostle saith belong's <HI>the Adoption, the Covenants, and the promises,</HI> that is, the ex|ternall Adoption whereby God account's them his Children, or the Children of his house, an family, the Children of the Church; and accordingly have the promises belonging to them in respect of outward dispensation although they be not Children by internall Adoption, to whom belongs the promises by effectuall and speciall communication of saving Grace: It is clearer then the day, that ma|ny who are inwardly, or in respect of inward Covenant, the Children

of the <HI>Devil,</HI> are outwardly, or in respect of outward Covenant, the Children of God, <HI>Isay.</HI> 1. 2. <HI>I have brought up Children,</HI> and yet <HI>Re|bellious;</HI> and in the next verse they are called [<HI>my People</HI>] (<HI>i. e.</HI> by outward Covenant) and yet worse then <HI>the Ox, or Asse: Deut.</HI> 32. 19, 20. they are called <HI>Sons,</HI> and yet <HI>provokeing God</HI> to revengefull Wrath; and <HI>Children,</HI> and yet <HI>without Faith.</HI> And look, as some may be externally <HI>Dogs,</HI> and yet internally <HI>Believers:</HI> (as the woman of Ca~naan, whom, in respect of outward Covenant, Christ calls a <HI>Dog:</HI> and the <HI>Jewes,</HI> who yet rejected him <HI>Children Mat.</HI> 15. 26) so many may be externally Children, in respect of external Covenant, and yet internally <HI>Dogs,</HI> and evil men, and we see that the purest Churches of Christ are called <HI>Saints,</HI> and faithful, &amp; Children of God and yet many among them Hypocrites, and unbelievers; because they that in respect of Church estate, and outward Covenant, and profession, are outwardly, or federally Saints; are many times in|wardly, and really un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound: Hence therefore it is, that when we say, that Children are in Covenant, and so Church-Members the mean|ing is, not that they are alwaies in inward Covenant, and inward Church-Members, who enjoy the inward, and saveing benefits of the Covenant, but that they are in external, and outward Covenant, and therefore outwardly Church Members, to whom belongs some outward priviledges of the Covenant for their inward and eternall good.</P>
<P>These things being clear, I the rather make mention of them, to undermine d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vers usual objections against the Membership, and Co|venant-Interest of Children; as, that they have no saving Grace ma|ny times; and that they make no actuall profession of any grace; and that many of them degenerate, and prove corrupt, and wicked <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for suppose all these, yet God may take them into outward Co|venant (which is sufficient to make them the Church-Seed or Mem|bers of the Church) although he doth not receive them into inward Covenant, in bestowing upon them saving Grace, or Power to profess it, nay though they degenerate, and grow very corrupt after|ward.</P>

<PB N="3" REF="000082_0025_0F9F9184CF31E868">
Children are comprehended; and because the Knowledg of it is ex|ceeding usefull and very pleasant, I shall therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a short taste of it, as a light to our after-discourse, especially as it is considered in the largest extent of it. This outward covenant therefore consists chiefly of these three branches, or speciall promises:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Lord engageth himselfe to them, that they shall be called by his Name, or his Name shall be called upon them, as 'tis Isay.</HI> 63. 19. They shall be called <HI>the Sons of God, Hos.</HI> 1. 10. and <HI>the People of God, Deut.</HI> 29. 12. 13. Thou becamest <HI>mine, Ezek.</HI> 16. 8. They may not be his Sons, and People really, and savingly, but God will Ho|nour them outwardly (at least) with this name, and priviledg: they shall bear his name, to be called so, and consequently to be accoun|ted so by others, and to be reckoned as of the number of his visible Church, and People; just as one that Adopts a young Son, he tel's the Father if he carry it well toward him when he is grown up to years, he shall possess the inheritance it selfe, but yet in the mean while he shall have this favour to be called his son, and be of his fami|ly, and houshold, and so be reckoned among the number of his Sons: <HI>see Rom.</HI> 9. 4.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lord promiseth that they shall, above all others in the World, have the meanes of doing them Good, and of conveying of the speciall Be|nefits of the Covenant; Nay they shall be set apart above all People in the World, to enjoy these speciall benefits of Remission of Sins, power against sin, eternal life, &amp;c. and shall certainly have these, by these meanes, unless they refuse them:</HI> this is evident from these, and such like Scriptures and examples; <HI>what priviledge hath the Jew</HI> (saith the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 1. <HI>and what advantage by Circumcision,</HI> if by nature under wrath, and sin&punc; for upon that ground the Apostle make's the question) he Answers 'tis <HI>much every way,</HI> but <HI>chiefly because to them were committed the Oracles of God: i. e.</HI> the Word, promises, Covenant: which are the ordinary meanes of saving grace&punc; and eternall good: others hear the word, but these in outward Covenant <HI>enjoy it by Covenant, and promise;</HI> and hence these in the first place, and principally, are sought after by these meanes; and therefore Christ forbids his Disci|ples at first to go preach in the way of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> (persons out of Covenant) but to <HI>the lost sheep of the house of Israel, Mat.</HI> 10. 6. and

And although he bid's his disciples go preach to all nations, yet <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 26. it's said unto you <HI>First</HI> hath he sent Christ, because you are <HI>children of the pro|mise</HI> and <HI>Covenant,</HI> verse 25: <HI>Repent therefore, and be conversed,</HI> verse 19. Do not resist, or refuse Christ, for he hath <HI>First</HI> sent Christ to you <HI>to bless you, and turn you from your iniquities;</HI> and the promise is full and fair, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 23. <HI>If they abide not in unbeliefe,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> in refusing grace, and Christ when offered) <HI>they shall be graffed in,</HI> for God is able to do it, and will do it: and the reason why the Lord gave his people up to their own counsells; it was, because <HI>My people would none of me,</HI> after all the meanes God used for their good, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81. 11, 12, 13. And <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 6. <HI>The Lord hath chosen you, above all people on the earth, to be a special people to himselfe, and thou art an holy people unto the Lord:</HI> How a holy people? by inward holiness? no verily, for many of them were inwardly unholy, both Parents and children, but thou art <HI>holy, i. e.</HI> thou art externally sanctified, and set apart by special meanes of holiness, to be a special people unto God. And there|fore <HI>Isay</HI> 5. 7. <HI>the men of Judah</HI> are called Gods <HI>pleasant plant: i. e.</HI> planted into the root and fatness of the Church, and therefore had all meanes used for their further special good, <HI>verse</HI> 4. <HI>What could bee done to my vineyard, that hath not been done?</HI> And hence it is, that though the word may come to heathens as well as Church-mem|bers, yet it comes not to them <HI>by way of Covenant,</HI> as it doth to Church-members; nor have they any promise of mercy aforehand, as Church-members have; nor is it <HI>chiefly</HI> belonging to such, but unto the children of the Covenant &amp; the promise, as hath been said. And hence also it follow's that God never cutt's off the seed of his Servants from the special benefits of the Covenant, untill they have had the meanes thereunto, and they have positively rejected those meanes: and hence the Jewes (who are made the Pattern of what God will do toward all Gentile-churches, <HI>Rom.</HI> II.) were never cast off till by positive unbelief they provoked the Lord to break them off, by rejecting and refusing the meanes of their eternal peace</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Lord promiseth, that the seed of his people (indefinitely con|sidered) shall have this heart</HI> (<ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> <HI>which would refuse special grace, and mercy</HI>) <HI>taken away,</HI> as well as meanes used for that end: this is evi|dent

from <HI>Deut.</HI> 30. 6. <HI>The Lord thy God r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill Circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord:</HI> he will cut off the uncircumci|sion, and sin, and resistance of the heart against God; he will <HI>take away the stony heart:</HI> not indeed from all, in outward Covenant <HI>par|ticularly;</HI> but from these <HI>indefinitely;</HI> so that there is no promise to do this for any out of the visible Church, (though God of his Sove|raignty, and free mercy somtimes doth so) but the <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mise</HI> of this <HI>belongs</HI> indefinitely to those of his Church, among whom usually, and ordinarily he worke's this great work, leaving him to his own freeness of secret mercy, to work thus on whom he will, and when he will: in the mean while no man can exclude himself, or any others within this Covenant from hope of this mercy, and grace, but may with comfort look and pray for it; for <HI>this is Gods Covenant that the Redeemer shall come out of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on, and turn away ungodlyness from Jacob, Rom.</HI> 11. 26, 27. for the Covenant of God doth not only run thus; If thou believe and receive grace thou shalt have it; but thus also, I will Circumcise your heart, I will take away the stony heart, I will turn away ungodliness from you, I will enable to believe: And hence these three things follow from these things thus opened.</P>
<P N="1">1. That as the Covenant run's not only thus, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>If thou believ|est thou shalt be saved,</HI> but also <HI>I will enable to believe;</HI> So a mans entrance into Covenant is not only by actual and personal professi|on of Faith [as some say] because God's Covenant run's a peg high|er, <ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> to make and enable some to believe, and so to make that profession.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the very outward Covenant is not <HI>meerly conditional,</HI> but there is something <HI>absolute</HI> in it: and hence it follow's, that it is a great mistake of some who think that Circumcision, and Baptism, seal only conditionally [the outward Covenant being [say they] meerly conditionall] for those three things mentioned in the outward Covenant you see are in some respect absolute, and if the Covenant was only conditionall, then the Lord was no more in Covenant with Church-Members, than with pagans, and infidels, for it may be propounded conditionally to all such, that if they believe, they shall be saved, but assuredly God's grace is a little more extensive to the one, then to the other.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="000082_0028_0F9F9187DBBD8C18">
3 Hence you may see what <HI>Circumcision</HI> once did, and <HI>Baptisme</HI> now <HI>seal's</HI> unto, even to Infants the seal is to confirm the Covenant: the Covenant is, that God (outwardly at least) owne's them, and rec|kon's them among his people, and Children, within his visible Church and Kingdome, and that here upon he will prune, and cutt, and dresse, and water them, and improve the means of their eternal good upon them, which good they shall have, unless they refuse in resisting the means; nay that he will take away this refuseing heart from among them indefinitely, so that though every one cannot assure himself, that he will do it particularly for this or that person, yet every one, through this promise, may hope, and pray for the communication of this grace, and so feel it in time.</P>
<P>These things thus premised, to clear up the ensuing discourse, I shall now do two things. 1. Leave a few grounds and reasons to prove, <HI>that Children are in Church-Covenant, and so enjoy Church-Membership by their parents.</HI> 2. I shall then <HI>Answer your scruples.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the first;</HI> The truth of it is manifest, by clearing up this propo|sition;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argum:</HI> 1.</NOTE> <ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> <HI>That one and the same Covenant which was made to Abraham in the old Testament is for substance the same with that in the New; and this under the new Testament, the very same with that of Abraham's under the old.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I say for Substance</HI> the same, for it is acknowledged that there was somthing <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>personal</HI> in <HI>Abraham's</HI> Covena~t, as <HI>to be a Father of many Nations,</HI> but this was not of <HI>the Substance</HI> of the Covenant, which belong's to all the Covenanters, and unto which the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">l of Circumcision</HI> was set: for all Abraham's seed, neither in those, nor these dayes, are the fathers of many nations, nor did Circumcision seal it.</P>
<P>Again it is confessed, that the <HI>external administrations</HI> of this one &amp; the same covenant, are diverse; but still <HI>the Covenant for substance</HI> is the same: For that old covenant was dispensed with other external signes, sacrifices, types, prophesies, then this under the new. There was something Typical in Abraham's covena~t concerning <HI>Canaan</HI> a type of heaven but yet the same Covenant remaine's now with a more naked manner of dispensation, or promise of heaven&punc; And hence it follow's, that if it may appear, that the Covenant it self is one and the same, now, as then; then, as now; then it will undeniably
<PB N="7" REF="000082_0029_0F9F9188939A95D0">
follow, that if the New Covenant under the Gospel be not a <HI>carnal</HI> Covenant, no more was that: if the new-Covenant be not proper to Abraham's <HI>natural seed,</HI> no more was that which was made with A|braham: if the substance of that Covenant was, <HI>I will be a God to thee and the seed,</HI> then this very Covenant remaine's still under the Gospel, it being one and the same with that; if by vertue of that Co|venant, the Children were made <HI>Members of the Church;</HI> and hence had a Church priviledge, and seal administred; then the same Cove|nant remaining the same, and in the same force, and benefit, <HI>our Children</HI> also are taken into <HI>the like Membership.</HI> It remaine's ther|fore to prove that which all our Divines have long since made good against the Papists, <HI>that the Covenant then, and now, is for substance one and the same;</HI> or that the Coven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t made with Abraham was a Gospel-Covenant, and this Gospel-Covenant the same that was made with Abraham.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Covenant made with Abraham is renewed in the Gospel,</HI> as to the main thing in it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>I will be their God, and they shall be my people, Heb.</HI> 8. 10. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31. 33 and though <HI>the seed</HI> be not exprest, yet its understood, as 'tis <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 8. &amp; if need be shall be proved hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because Abraham's Covenant is of Gospel &amp; eternal priviledges.</HI> Not proper therefore to him, and his fleshly posterity. For <HI>righteous|ness by Faith</HI> was sealed up by Circumcision <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. which is a Gospel priviledge, and is the ground of all other priviledges, and yet in <HI>Gen</HI> 17 7. there is no expression of this righteousness&punc; by Faith, but it is understood therefore in this, I will be their God; So the promise of eternal life, and resurrection therunto is wrapt up in this, <HI>I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Because there was never any Covenant, but it was either of Grace, or workes:</HI> that of workes on mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> that of Grace which was made with <HI>Abraham:</HI> and hence <HI>Gal.</HI> 3 17. <HI>The Covenant which was confirmed afore by Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Law</HI> 430 <HI>years after cannot dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">null:</HI> and what was that Covenant before? surely it was the Covenant of <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> it was confirmed by <HI>Christ:</HI> and what was this Cove|nant confirmed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but the Covenant made with <HI>Abraham?</HI> for of this the Apostle speakes, verses 14, 16. And he cal's it express|ly by the Name of <HI>Gospel,</HI> or the Gospel Covenant; verse 8, 9.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="8" REF="000082_0030_0F9F918E5AF98098">
4. Because <HI>when God reneweth his promise and Covenant made with Abraham, with his people at the plaines of Moab,</HI> Deut. 30. 6. it run's in these words, <ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> <HI>I will Circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed,</HI> now this is a <HI>Gospel priviledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and a <HI>Gospel-Covenant:</HI> as ap|peares by comparing this text with <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 8. wherin <HI>the right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s|ness of faith,</HI> or the Gospel, is brought in speaking the words of this Covenant, saying <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in thy heart &amp; mouth, Deut.</HI> 30. 11, 12, 13, 14. Now if that place, Gen. 17. 7. should be said to be obscure concerning the promise [I will be a God to thy seed] yet here in this place God speak's plainly, which by comparing the scrip|tures is a Gospel promise, and of a Gospel priviledge and therefore to be preach't by Ministers of the Gospel, and to be believed by the professors of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Because this promise</HI> [I will be a God to thee and thy seed] <HI>doth not belong to Abraham &amp; his seed as after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> or as lineally descend|ed of Abraham: <HI>but as believers,</HI> and this is most evident <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. wherein 'tis said of the Jews, 1. That they were <HI>broken off</HI> (made no people no Church&punc; <HI>by unbeliefe,</HI> verse 20. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 2. That by <HI>Faith</HI> they shall be graffed in again, verse 23. If therefore they were bro|ken off the Church by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> then they stood as members of the Church by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">:</HI> and if by faith they should be graffed in, then they stood by faith at first: Against is said in this <HI>Rom</HI> 11. 28. that they are <HI>love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> surely not as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> fathers, but as <HI>spi|ritual by faith:</HI> and hence <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> 9. 8. it is expressly said, that <HI>God found Abraham faith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and made a Covenant with him.</P>
<P>Again if the posterity of Abraham were Members upon this ground only or chiefly, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> because they were <HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> then <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Rom.</HI> 11. 20 could never have been cast off from being Members of the Church, because they were alway the natural off-spring &amp; posterity of Abraham. Hence therefore it fol|low's that if they were ingraffed in the Church <HI>as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> (the Fa|thers as actually believing the Children as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> apart by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of God to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ade to believe and in their Parents Faith accounted be|lievers) then all believers at this day have the same priviledge and the Covenant then being made only in respect of Faith, must needs be Gospel Covenant, the same with God's Covenant at this day. And
<PB N="9" REF="000082_0031_0F9F919002AEB4E0">
hence also it follow's that if they were Members as Believers, then not as Members of that nation. They were not therefore members of the Church, because they were descended of Abraham, and were in a national Church, and were by generation Jews. Circumcision was a Seal of Righteousness by Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. therefore they were sealed as believers.</P>
<P>Thus much for the first argument, wherein I have been the larger, because much light is let in by it, to answer divers mistakes. I shall name the rest with morer brevity.</P>
<P>Argum: 2. <HI>If it was the curse of Gentiles, to be strangers to the Cove|nants of promise (made with the Jews) before they became the Churches of God; then by being Churches, this Curse is removed;</HI> and hence <HI>Ephe.</HI> 2. 12, 13. The Apostle saith they <HI>were strangers to the Covenant,</HI> and <HI>Common-wealth of Israel,</HI> but are not so now. If you say that the <HI>Ephesians</HI> were in Covenant, but not their seed, and so they were not strangers? <HI>I Answer</HI> that the Apostle doth not set out their cursed estate meerly because they were without <HI>any Covenant,</HI> but because they were strangers to <HI>that Covenant</HI> of promise which the <HI>Israelites</HI> had; for if their children had it not, they were then as without Covenant&punc; so without God, and without hope, as Pagans are, which is notoriously cross to the current of all Scripture, as may afterward appear.</P>
<P><HI>Argum:</HI> 3. The Apostle expresly saith [<HI>Your children are holy</HI>] 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7 14. <HI>and if severally holy, then of the Church,</HI> [for <HI>reall</HI> holy|ness cannot be here meant] <HI>and in the Covenant of its</HI> even as 'tis said <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 6 thou art <HI>an Holy people unto the Lord thy God:</HI> few of which number were <HI>really and savingly</HI> holy, but they were all so <HI>fede|rally,</HI> or <HI>by Covenant,</HI> and so became Gods special Church or people.</P>
<P>If you say, That this holiness is meant of <HI>matrimonial holiness,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that your children are not <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rds,</HI> but <HI>legitimate:</HI> The <HI>answer is easy;</HI> for upon this interpretation the Apostle's Answer should be false; for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en if one of the parents had not been a Believer, and so by his Believing Sanct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed his unbelieving W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fe, their Children must have been Bastards, whereas you know that their Children had not been in that sence unclean or ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate, although neither of them were Believers: for the Apostle's dispute is plain, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that if the
<PB N="10" REF="000082_0032_0F9F9191E2642F18">
Believing Husband did not Sanctify his unbelieving Wife, <HI>then</HI> were <HI>your Children unclean, i. e.</HI> say you <HI>Bastards,</HI> but it's evident that Chil|dren may be, in this sense, clean, and yet no Faith in either Parent to Sanctify one another to their particular use: unless you will say, that all Children of heathens are Bastards, because neither of the pa|rents Believe.</P>

<P>I know there are some and very holy &amp; learned also, who think that if any godly man undertakes to be <HI>as a father</HI> to an <HI>adopted Pagan or In|dian,</HI> that such an one, not grown up to yeares, is from the example in <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. to be received into the Covenant of the Church, and the seale of it: and I confess, I yet see no convicting argument against it, if it could be proved that some servants bought with Abraham's money were such, and were under years, but I see as yet no convict|ing argument for this assertion from this example; and therefore

I stick to the former answer, and see no reason, from any rule of charity, but to believe that all those in Abrahams family, were either visibly godly or the children of such; to whom Circumcision be|long's: and consequently might as well partake of Church-member|ship, as Abraham himself; which sort of servants in these dayes may as well be admitted to Church-membership, without fear of defiling the Church, as their masters themselves.</P>
<P>Object: 2. <HI>If Children (say you) be members, then all Children, good and bad, must be received, as Jacob and Esau &amp;c:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. Why not?</HI> for if there be any strength in this Argument, it holds as strongly against the admission of professing visible believ|ers: where, though all are <HI>externally,</HI> and federally holy, yet some, yea many, yea the greatest part of such may be <HI>inwardly bad,</HI> and as prophane in their hearts, as Esau: and must we therefore refuse them to be Church-members because many of them may be inward|ly bad? verily there must then never be Churches of God in this world. So 'tis among children, they are all outwardly holy, yet many of them may be inwardly unholy, like Esau, must we not therfore accept them to Membership? It is a miserable mistake to think that inward reall holyness is the only ground of admission in|to Church-Membership, as some <HI>Anabaptists</HI> dispute, but it is fede|ral holyness, whether externally professed as in grown persons, or gra|ciously promised unto their seed.</P>
<P>Reply 1. <HI>But you here Reply, If so, then they are of the Church when they are grown up, and prophane, untill they are cast out:</HI> and to take in prophane, is sinfull, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44.</P>
<P><HI>Answ. It is very true;</HI> For 'tis herein just as 'tis in admitting profes|sing believers, they may prove prophane, and continue so in Church|membership, untill they are cast out; but is this therefore any ground to keep out those who are personally holy by their own profession? no verily, why then should such as are parentally, and federally holy be kept out from Church-Membership because they <HI>may prove pro|phone me,</HI> and being prophane must <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Church-Members</HI> till they be cast out.</P>
<P>Reply 2 <HI>But then (you say) they must be Church-Members though their Parents themselves, and the whole Church be unwilling thereunto,

even as (say you) a man that marrieth a woman, her children must be his, and he be a Father to them, though he and she, and they should say be shall not be a father in law to them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This similitude of marriage doth neither prove, nor illust|rate the thing; For the relation between father and such children is absolute &amp; natural, and hence continues though they say he shall not be their father, and though he profess he will not; but the relation founded upon Church-covenant, between member and member, is not natural, nor only, and allway absolute; but also con|ditionall, which condition not being kept, the relation may be, and is usually broken; for look as the <HI>Jews</HI> were not so absolutely God's people, but if they did in time <HI>reject</HI> the Gospel, they were to be cast off, and indeed are so at this day, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 25. <HI>Hosea</HI> 2. 2. <HI>Acts</HI> 13 46; 51. So 'tis with all Gentile Churches, and the members thereof:&amp; as for that which you last say, That <HI>they may refuse their Parents Co|venant at age, as well as own it, and so may members go out at pleasure,</HI> which is disorder. <HI>I answer,</HI> That the like may be said of such members as come in by personal profession, for they may renounce their own Covenant with God and the Church, one may doe so, and so may twentie, yet though this be wickedness and disorder, yet the Church may proceed against them, and so it may against their Chil|dren, who are bound to own the Covenant made with God, and of God with them in their Parents, as well as any Church-Members are to own their own Covenant by their own personal profession. What disorder therfore will come in as you conceive this way will come in by your own way, and what course you should take to heal the one, by the same you may heal the other.</P>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. What Churches shall we have? Truely not allway Churches of Angels and saints, but mixt with many chaffy hypocrites and oft times prophane persons. But still I say this objection holds as firm against gathering Churches of visible professing believers; For God knowe's what Churches we may have of them, even heaps of hypocrites, and prophane persons, for I know not what can give

us hope of their not apostatizing, but only Gods promise to <HI>be a God to them,</HI> and to preserve them; and truly the same promise, be|ing made to <HI>their seed,</HI> gives me as much ground of faith to hope well of Churches rising out of the seed of the godly, as of the professing Parents themselves. I know one may have more <HI>experimental chari|ty</HI> concerning some few professing the fear of God, but my <HI>Church|charity</HI> is equal about them, especially considering, that those whom God receiv's into Church Covenant, he doth not only take them to be a people to him, but to <HI>establish</HI> them to be such, <ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> for time to come.

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Yes verily, there is a plain difference between member and member (though professing believers) in point of priviledge, though they lie under no sin: for, a <HI>man</HI> may speak and prophesy in the Church, not <HI>Women.</HI> A company of <HI>Men</HI> may make a Church, and so receive in, and cast out of the Church, but not <HI>Wo|man</HI> though professing Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. All grown men are not to be admitted (though professing Believers) to the <HI>Lords Supper;</HI> my reason is; A man may Believe in Christ, and yet be very ignorant of the nature, use, and ends of the Lords Supper, now such may be <HI>Baptized</HI> as soon as ever faith appeares, <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. but they may not be admitted to the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> because they will be <HI>guilty of the body and blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d of the Lord,</HI> if they through their ignorance, cannot <HI>discern the Lords body.</HI> I know no reason but ignorant persons may be as well suspended from the use of this priviledge, though they be true believers (for faith may consist with much ignorance) as well as distracted persons, who not|withstanding may be believers also.</P>
<P N="3">3. If therefore children be able to <HI>examine themselves and discern the Lords body,</HI> they may then eat; and herein there is no difference in this priviledge between member and member.</P>
<P N="4">4. Children not being usually able to <HI>examine themselves, nor discern the Lords body,</HI> hence they are not to be admitted to the use of <HI>this pri|viledge:</HI> and yet they may be such <HI>members</HI> as may enjoy the benefit of other priviledges even that of <HI>Baptisme:</HI> for <HI>baptisme</HI> seales up our <HI>first entrance</HI> into the Covenant. This first entrance is not allway by personal <HI>profession</HI> of Faith, but by Gods <HI>promise</HI> of working, or of vouchsafeing the meanes of working of it, now Children (as is

proved) being under this Covenant (as we see all the posterity also of Abraham was) hence though children cannot profess faith, nor actu|ally examine themselves yet they may receive, and must receive <HI>bap|tisme,</HI> being allready under Gods Covenant; but because the <HI>Lords Supper</HI> doth not seal up this first entrance, and first right to the Co|venant, but our <HI>growth and fruition</HI> of the Covenant; hence this act on our part is required to participate in this, which the Apostle calls self-examination, and the act of <HI>takeing,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Christ, and of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iscerning the Lords <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ody),</HI> and of <HI>doing this in remembrance</HI> of Christ: which every baptised person, and Church-member is not allway able to do. A child may receive a promise aforehand of a rich estate given him, and this promise sealed up to him, his father receiving it for him, but it is not fit that he should be put to the actual improve|ment, and fruition of that estate, untill he is grown up, understands himselfe, and knows how to do it: so 'tis here, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper requires ability, 1. To take Christ as our own. 2. To eat Christ, that is, to take fruition of him: the which acts of faith, God doth not require of all those immediately, who are wrapt up in Covenant with him.</P>
<P>Object. 1. <HI>But here you say, that that examination</HI> 1 Cor 11. <HI>is required of all that be members, and that at all times&punc;, as well as at their first comming to the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This examination is indeed required of all those members who should partake of the Lords Supper, but it is not required (as you seem to say) of every one to make him a <HI>member,</HI> so that none can be a member, but him that is able to examine himselfe; for Gods Co|venant to work faith, and to give power to examine one's selfe after|ward, may make some as truely members as those who are able to act &amp; express their faith. Now I have proved that Gods Covenant is aforehand given to children: and to give them the seal of their first entrance into it many yeares after, is as vile a thing, as for them that are able, and fit to examine themselves, to have this Sacrament of the Lord, Supper denied, or delaied till many yeares after.</P>
<P>Object. 2. But you say, <HI>It's left to every ones conscience to exa|mine himself, not that others should examine them, and consequently if&punc; children be members, then it must be left upon their conscience.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="000082_0040_0F9F9197B042E390">
<HI>Answ.</HI> We know in our own consciences that Children usually cannot examine themselves, now if the Elders &amp; the Church are bou~d to see Christs rules observed by others, and if this examination be the rule that all must walk by who participate here, then they must not suffer such yong ones, no nor persons grown up, and entred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n by personal profession, to receive this seal, as they know are unable thus to do: I think if Churches should degenerate in these dayes, this course of Discipline should be attended (especially by <HI>the Elders</HI>) to|ward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y of their members, which way soever they have entred, whether by their own, or by their parents covenant: And I have oft feared that there is some need already of it, even toward some who en|ter by their own covenant, and may have saith, but are miserably to seek in the <HI>nature, use, and ends of the Lords Supper,</HI> and consequently unfit to <HI>discern of Christ's body,</HI> and so to come to that Sacrament.</P>

The outward Covenant is not allway first entred into by personal profession of faith, but by Gods Covenant of promise to work, or to use the meanes to work faith: Hence it undeniably follows; that as many may be in Church-covenant before they profess faith personally, so many may be members of the Church without this profession of faith; for this Covenant of working faith (as hath been formerly explained) doth not only belong to the Jews, but to Gentile Churches also, and Believers; as hath been proved, and might further be confirmed.</P>

If you see children, of whom you cannot say that they are faithfull personally, yet they may be faithfull federally (as hath been shewed) for they may lie under God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Covenant of begetting faith, by some meanes in them; and then you are not to cast them out, but accept them, as God doth.</P>

<P>Thus you see an answer to your <HI>Six Objections.</HI> In the end of your paper there are <HI>TWO QUESTIONS,</HI> which I suppose may not a little trouble against their Baptisme and membership. To these briefly.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>What good (say you) is it, either for a wicked, or an elect Child, till he be converted, to be in the Church? or what good may any have by being in the Church, till they can profit by what they enjoy?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1 The Apostle put's the like case, and gives you an Answer <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 1, 2. <HI>what advantage hath the Jew, and what profit is there of Cir|cumcision?</HI> what use or profit could the Infants then make of their Church-Covenant, Membership, or Seal, who understood none of these things? do you think the Lord exposed his holy ordinances then unto contempt? and is more carefull that they may be profitably used now? was there no good by Circumcision? yea saith the Apostle, <HI>much every way.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What profit is it to persons grown up to yeares, and yet secretly hy|pocrites, who enter into the Church by profession of the faith?</HI> you will say there is good and profit in respect of the priviledges themselves, but they abusing them they had, in this respect, better have been without them, because they bring hereby upon themselves greater condemna|tion. The same say I of children, whom God receives into his

Church, by promise, and Covenant of doing them good, although at present they may not be so sensible of this good.</P>
<P N="3">3. To speak plainly, <HI>the good they get by being thus enriched is won|derfull:</HI> and here there is more need of a <HI>Treat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> then of a <HI>Letter,</HI> to clear up the benefits from all Scruples, arising by being in outward Covenant, in Church fellowship, even unto Infants: I confess I find little said by <HI>Writers</HI> upon this Subject, &amp; I believe the doubts against <HI>childrens Baptisme,</HI> as they arise by blindness in this particular; so I think that God suffers that opinion to take place, that by such dark|ness he may bring out light in this particular. I will only hint unto you some few of my many thoughts, which have long exercised me for many yeares in this thing. The <HI>good</HI> by childrens <HI>membership,</HI> especially when <HI>Sealed,</HI> is in four things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In respect of God.</HI> God shews hereby the riches of <HI>his grace</HI> to|ward them, in <HI>taking them to be his people: In Adopting them to be his children: In preventing them with many special promises aforehand of doing them good;</HI> by all which, the Lord doth as it were <HI>prevent Sa|tan,</HI> in wooing their hearts as it were, so soon to draw them to him before he can actually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to draw their soules from him. So that I beseech you consider, suppose they cannot as yet understand, and so make profit by all this, yet is it not good for them, or for any of us to partake of Gods grace, before we know how to make use of it? is it not good for God to be good to them that are evil? is it not good for God to glorifie &amp; make manifest his grace to man, though man knowes not how to make use of his grace? was it not rich grace for <HI>Christ</HI> to wash <HI>Peters</HI> feet, and yet he not know at present what it meant, only (saith Christ) <HI>thou shalt know it afterward?</HI> is it not good for God to give life to us, and to let us be born in such and such a place of the Gospel where it is preached, and to lay in mercy aforehand for us, before we know how to be thankfull, or know how to use any of these outward mercies? and is it no mercy or favour to have so much spiritual mercy bestowed on children a|forehand, before they can be thankfull, or make use thereof? <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 6, 7. The choosing of them to be his people, above all other people (which you know was from the womb) it's called <HI>Gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his Love upon them,</HI> and the reason of this Love, <HI>verse</HI> 8. is said to be,
<PB N="22" REF="000082_0044_0F9F919A97D14658">
<HI>because God loved them,</HI> this love was not Electing, &amp; peculiar love, (for thousands of these perished and went to hell) but it was his <HI>ex|ternall adopting love</HI> to choose them to be his people, and to improve all means for their good, and to give them the good of all those means unless they refuse: and to give indefinitely among them, and particu|larly to many of them, such hearts as that they shall not be able to refuse the good of those meanes (as hath been shewed formerly) this is love, great love &amp; mercy; not shewn or promised to any who are not of the visible Church throughout the whole world. By which God is glorified; &amp; let him be so, though we cannot see how to pro|fit by it, when it first break's out; Have not you profited much by considering Gods preventing grace, long before you understood how to make use of it? hath not God received much glory from you for it? hath this grace then think you, been unprofitably spent on Gods part? No verily: The case is the same here, David blesseth God; for <HI>bring his God from his Mothers belly, and from the womb, Psal.</HI> 22. 9, 10. and Gods grace is shewn through this expression, <HI>Isai.</HI> 46. 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e is much good hereby in respect of the Parents;</HI> for, suppose the children cannot profit by it, yet Parents may, and 'tis in respect of them very much that God looks upon their children, thus to receive them into Covenant, <HI>Deut.</HI> 4. 37. For, 1. <HI>Parents may hereby see, and wonder at the riches of Gods grace,</HI> to become a God&punc; not only to themselves, but to take in their seed also, whose good they prize as their own, and as if done to themselves: hence <HI>Abra|ham fell down upon his face,</HI> adoring God, when he heard of this Co|venant, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. See also how <HI>Moses</HI> aggravates this love, in the eyes of all that had eyes to see, <HI>Deut.</HI> 10. 14, 15. 2. <HI>Hereby God gives Pa|rents some comfortable hope of their childrens salvation;</HI> because they be within the pale of the visible Church; for as out of the visible Church (where the ordinary meanes of salvation be) there is <HI>ordinarily</HI> no salvation, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 47. So if children were not of Christs visible Church and Kingdome, we could not hope for their salvation, no more then of Pagans, or Turks; for if they be <HI>without God,</HI> they are <HI>without hope, Ephes.</HI> 2. 12. and to be without hope of such, to whom God hath made such promises of salvation, not given to Pa|gans, nor proper to <HI>Abraham,</HI> is very hard, and horrid to imagine;
