<P>_YOUR Lord&s;hip having &s;igni|fied your Plea&s;ure, that the SERMON which you heard, when You did us the Honour to be pre&s;ent at the Open|ing of our Pari&s;h-Church, &s;hould be made publick; notwith&s;tanding my Aver&s;ene&s;s to Print any thing in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; yet out of a ju&s;t Sen&s;e both of that Obedience which I owe to You as my <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and of that Kindne&s;s which I have received from You as my Patron, I have now done it, and herewith make bold to pre&s;ent it to You.

Nature will have upon the Minds of tho&s;e who &s;hould have &s;o much Patience as to read it, I know not; but mu&s;t leave that to him who hath the Hearts of all Men in his Hand. My Subject I am &s;ure is good and nece&s;&s;ary: And as for my plain and practical way of handling it, it is that which my Text requireth, in that it commanded, that in our Chri&s;tian Congregations, <HI>All Things be done to Edifying.</HI> So that unle&s;s I had endeavoured to &s;uit it to the Capaci|ties of all there pre&s;ent, and to make it as <HI>Edifying</HI> as I could unto them, my Sermon had been a Contradiction to my Text: And be&s;ides that, I had lo&s;t my De&s;ign in Preach|ing it: Which was, to convince tho&s;e e&s;|pecially, who&s;e Souls, under your Lord&s;hip, are committed to my Care and Conduct, of <HI>the Excellency and U&s;efulne&s;s of the Com|mon-Prayer,</HI> and &s;o to per&s;uade them to the con&s;tant and con&s;cientious U&s;e of it; not only becau&s;e it is conformable to the Doctrine, Di&s;cipline, and Practice of the Univer&s;al Church, nor only becau&s;e it is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Laws both of our Church and State (though they al&s;o be very great Rea&s;ons) but likewi&s;e becau&s;e that Extra|ordinary Benefit and Advantage which they would receive from it, for the <HI>Edifying</HI> of

<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that much more might have been &s;aid upon this Excellent Subject; but intending no more than a plain Sermon upon the Occa&s;ion, I was forced to omit many things, and to confine my &s;elf to &s;uch only, which were mo&s;t obvious, and &s;eemed the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for People to know and practi&s;e, in order to their being reconciled unto, and <HI>Edified</HI> by our Publick Prayers.

<P>Let all Things be done to Edifying.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_WHEN <HI>Judas Maccabeus</HI> had new built the Altar, and repaired the Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> after it had been polluted and laid wa&s;te for Three Years toge|ther; the Church of God at that time and place rejoiced &s;o much at it, that they kept the Dedication of it eight Days, and or|dered that the &s;ame &s;hould be ob&s;erved every Year, 1 <HI>Mac.</HI> 4.59. And &s;o we find it was in our Saviour's time; for he him&s;elf was plea&s;ed to honour that Fe&s;|tival, though only of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical In&s;titution, with his own Pre&s;ence, <HI>John</HI> 10.22. In the like manner, we of this Pari&s;h have Cau&s;e to be tran&s;ported with Joy and Gladne&s;s, and to &s;pend this Day in prai&s;ing and adoring the mo&s;t High God, for that our Church which hath lain wa&s;te for above five times Three Years, is now at la&s;t rebuilt and fitted again, for his Wor&s;hip and Service. For what the Altar and Tem|ple were unto the <HI>Jews</HI> then, the &s;ame will our Church be unto us now. Did they there offer up their Sa|crifices unto God, as Types of the Death of Chri&s;t? We &s;hall here commemorate the &s;aid&punc; Death of Chri&s;t, typified by tho&s;e Sacrifices. Did they come from all parts of <HI>Judea</HI> to wor&s;hip God there?
<PB N="2" REF="003624_0007_100235665623C150">
So &s;hall we, I hope, come from all parts of this Pari&s;h to wor&s;hip God here. Was the Tem|ple an Hou&s;e of Prayer to them? So is this Church to us. Was that the place where God, ac|cording to his Promi&s;e, came unto his People to ble&s;s them? I do not doubt but he will do the &s;ame to us in this place, if we come unto it, and carry our &s;elves in it as we ought to do. In &s;hort, was the Temple the place where all things were performed, that could any way conduce to the <HI>Edifying</HI> of God's People, as things then &s;tood? The &s;ame may be &s;aid of our Church, as things now &s;tand. For what|&s;oever is, or can be, Nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Edifying</HI> of our Souls here, and &s;o to their Eternal Salvation hereafter, is clearly and fully comprehended in tho&s;e &s;everal Offices, which according to the Laws of the Land, are now to be performed in this placed. Nei|ther is there any thing contained in any of them, but what doth really conduce to the&s;e great Ends and Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT this being a thing which is denied by &s;ome, and under&s;tood but by few among&s;t us, I &s;hall en|deavour to explain and demon&s;trate unto all. Which I chu&s;e to do at this time, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t proper Subject I could think of for this Occa&s;ion. For unle&s;s what is to be now done in this place, will an&s;wer the Ends wherefore it is erected, all the Co&s;ts and Charges that have been laid out upon it, will be to no purpo&s;e at all. But if it can be ful|ly made out, That the Service which is here to be performed, doth highly conduce to the Advance|ment of God's Glory and your Happine&s;s, the great End wherefore &s;uch places are erected, then you cannot but acknowledge, that what&s;oever any of you have contributed towards it, is the be&s;t Money that ever you &s;pent; and that this Day, wherein the &s;aid Service is begun to be performed in it, is one of the mo&s;t joyful days that this Pari&s;h ever &s;aw.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003624_0008_1002357566551470">THIS therefore is that which I &s;hall endeavour to prove at this time: And for that end I have cho&s;en the&s;e Words for the Ground and Foundati|on of all that I &s;hall &s;ay upon this Subject. <HI>Let all Things be done to Edifying.</HI> For the right Under|&s;tanding whereof we mu&s;t know, that the Apo&s;tle having in this Chapter di&s;cour&s;ed at large concern|ing the way and manner of holding Chri&s;tian A&s;|&s;emblies, and having proved, that what&s;oever is there &s;aid, ought to be &s;poken in &s;uch a Language, that all there pre&s;ent may under&s;tand, and &s;o be <HI>edified</HI> by it; he at la&s;t &s;ums up the whole in this Propo&s;ition; <HI>How is it then Brethren? When ye come together, every one of you hath a P&s;alm, hath a Doc|trine, hath a Tongue, hath a Revelation, hath an Inter|pretation: Let all Things be done to Edifying</HI>: As if he &s;hould have &s;aid, What&s;oever Gifts any of you have, or pretend to, yet when you meet together upon a Religious Account, for the Publick Wor&s;hip of God, take &s;pecial care that <HI>all Things be</HI> there <HI>done, to</HI> the <HI>Edifying</HI> of all who are there pre&s;ent. From whence it is plain, that the Apo&s;tle lays down this as a general Rule, nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in all Chri&s;tian Congregations. So that when&s;oever we meet together to Wor&s;hip and Serve God, if any thing be there done which is not for our <HI>Edifica|tion,</HI> we come &s;hort of this Rule, and &s;o we do too, if any thing be there wanting that may con|duce to that end. For according to this Rule, as nothing is to be there done but what is for our <HI>Edifying,</HI> &s;o al&s;o on the other &s;ide, all Things that are, or can be, for our <HI>Edifying,</HI> ought to be there done.</P>
<P>BUT for our better under&s;tanding the true Sen&s;e and Purport of this Rule, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;i|der what the Apo&s;tle here means by <HI>Edifying</HI>: For which we mu&s;t know, That all Chri&s;tians being, as
<PB N="4" REF="003624_0009_10023567E25BDA48">
the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>of the Hou&s;hold of God, built upon the Foundation of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief Corner-&s;tone,</HI> Eph. 2.19, 20. Hence what&s;oever tends to the Strengthening, Sup|porting, Cementing, or Rai&s;ing this Fabrick higher, what&s;oever it is whereby Men are made more firm and &s;olid Chri&s;tians, more Holy and Perfect Men than they were before, by that they are &s;aid to be <HI>Edified.</HI> And therefore it is a great Mi&s;take for Men to think, as many do, that they are <HI>Edified</HI> by what they hear, merely becau&s;e they know per|haps &s;ome little thing which before they were ig|norant of. For <HI>Knowledge</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith) <HI>puffeth up,</HI> it is <HI>Charity that Edifieth,</HI> 2 Cor. 8.1. And therefore, what&s;oever Knowledge we attain to, we cannot be &s;aid to be <HI>Edified</HI> by it any further than as it influences our Minds, excites our Love, and inclines our Hearts to God and Goodne&s;s. And that this is the rrue Notion of <HI>Edifying,</HI> is plain from the Apo&s;tle's own Words, where he &s;aith, <HI>Let no cor|rupt Communication come out of your Mouths, but that which is for the u&s;e of Edifying, that it may mini&s;ter Grace unto the Hearers,</HI> Eph. 4.29. For from hence it is manife&s;t, that that only is properly &s;aid to <HI>E|dify,</HI> that mini&s;ters Grace unto us; whereby we are made more Pure and Holy than we were before. And therefore, we read of <HI>Edifying our &s;elves in Love,</HI> Eph, 4.16. <HI>And building up our &s;elves in our mo&s;t holy Faith,</HI> Jude 20. which are the two Graces that make up a real and true Chri&s;tian. And no|thing can be &s;aid to <HI>Edify,</HI> but what tends to the exciting and increa&s;ing of them: <HI>Until we come</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith) <HI>in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the Fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="003624_0010_10023576F2119C98">
God, all things there are to be &s;o done, that we may return home wi&s;er, and better than we came thither; with our Knowledge of God and Chri&s;t increa&s;ed, our De&s;ires inlarged, our Love inflamed, our Faith confirmed, all our Graces quickned, and &s;o our whole Souls made more humble, more Holy, more like to God, than they were before.</P>
<P>THE Words being thus briefly explained, I &s;hall now apply them to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and &s;hew that that Form of Religious Wor&s;hip, which is pre|&s;cribed by our Church, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Laws of the Land, and therefore to be u&s;ed now in this place, agrees exactly with this Rule, or Canon of the Holy Apo&s;tle, even that <HI>all things in it are done to Edifying.</HI></P>
<P>BUT before we prove that that Form in parti|cular, which our Church hath pre&s;cribed, is agree|able to this <HI>Apo&s;tolical Rule,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary to prove fir&s;t, That the pre&s;cribing a Form in general is &s;o. For unle&s;s the pre&s;cribing a Form in general, be according to this Rule, no Form in particular, that is pre&s;cribed, can po&s;&s;ibly agree with it. But now that this Rule admits, yea, requires the pre|&s;cribing of &s;ome Form, is evident from the Rule it &s;elf. For the Apo&s;tle here commands the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and &s;o all Provincial Churches, to take care that in their Religious A&s;&s;emblies <HI>all Things be done to Edifying.</HI> But how is it po&s;&s;ible for any Provincial Church to &s;ee that this be done, except &s;he pre&s;cribes &s;ome certain Form for the doing of it? If every <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> of a <HI>Pari&s;h</HI> &s;hould be left to his own Liberty, to do what he plea&s;ed in his own Congregation, although &s;ome perhaps might be &s;o wi&s;e and prudent as to ob&s;erve this Rule, as well
<PB N="6" REF="003624_0011_1002356A40C2CB30">
no way &s;ecured that all would; and therefore mu&s;t needs be obliged to con&s;ider of, and appoint &s;ome &s;uch Form to be u&s;ed in all her Congregations, by which &s;he may be fully a&s;&s;ured, that this A|po&s;tolical Rule is every where ob&s;erved, as it ought to be. And although we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e what can never be expected, that all the Clergy in every Province &s;hould be as wi&s;e and as good as they ought to be, yet it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that every one of them &s;hould under&s;tand what is for the <HI>E|dification</HI> of the People, as well as all together. And therefore it mu&s;t needs be acknowledged, that the &s;ure&s;t way to have this Rule ob&s;erv'd, is, for the Governors of every Church, and the whole Clergy, to meet together by their Repre&s;entatives in a Sy|nod, or Convocation, and there, upon mature Deli|beration, agree upon &s;ome &s;uch Form, which they in their Prudence and Con&s;ciences judge to be ac|cording to this Rule, which the Apo&s;tle here lays down before them.</P>
<P>AND be&s;ides that, the pre&s;cribing a Form in ge|neral, is more for our <HI>Edifying,</HI> than to leave every one to do what &s;eems good in his own Eyes. We have the concurrent Te&s;timony, Experience, and Practice of the Univer&s;al Church. For we never read or heard of any Church in the World, from the Apo&s;tles days to ours, but what took this cour&s;e. Though all have not u&s;ed the &s;ame, yet no Church but have u&s;ed &s;ome Form or other. And therefore for any Man to &s;ay, that it is not Lawful; or not Expedient, or not &s;o <HI>Edifying,</HI> to u&s;e a Form of Prayer in the Publick Wor&s;hip of God, is to contradict the general &s;en&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, to condemn the Holy Catholick Church, and to make him&s;elf wi&s;er than all Chri&s;tians that ever were before him. Which, what&s;oever it may be thought now, was always here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Sins and Follies</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003624_0012_10023578AC5D50A8">NAY, more than all this too: For this is not on|ly to make a Man's &s;elf wi&s;er than all Chri&s;tians, but wi&s;er than <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf: For it is impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;cribe any Form of Prayer in more plain and ex|pre&s;s Terms than he hath done it, where he &s;aith, <HI>When ye Pray, &s;ay, Our Father which art in Hea|ven,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Luk.</HI> 11.2. And I hope none here pre&s;ent but will acknowledge that Chri&s;t, by whom alone we can be <HI>Edified,</HI> knows better what is, or what is not for our <HI>Edification,</HI> than we, or all the Men in the World can do. And therefore &s;eeing he hath not only pre&s;cribed a Form of Prayer for his Di&s;ci|ples to u&s;e, but hath expre&s;ly commanded them to u&s;e it, we, who profe&s;s our &s;elves to be his Di&s;ciples, ought to re&s;t fully &s;atisfied in our Minds, that u&s;ing of a Form of Prayer is not only Lawful, but much more for our <HI>Edifying,</HI> than it is po&s;&s;ible for any o|ther way of Praying to be.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame may be proved al&s;o from the Nature of the thing it &s;elf, by &s;uch Arguments, which do not only demon&s;trate that it is &s;o, but likewi&s;e &s;hew how it comes to be &s;o. For <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In order to our being <HI>Edified,</HI> &s;o as to be made better and holier, when&s;oever we meet together upon a Religious ac|count, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;ame good and holy Things be always inculcated and pre&s;&s;ed upon us af|ter one and the &s;ame manner. For we cannot but all find by our own Experience, how difficult it is to fa&s;ten any thing that is truly good, either upon our &s;elves or others, and that it is rarely, if ever ef|fected, without frequent Repetitions of it. What&s;o|ever good things we hear only once, or now and then, though perhaps upon the hearing of them, they may &s;wim for a while in our <HI>Brains,</HI> yet they &s;eldom &s;ink down into our <HI>Hearts,</HI> &s;o as to move and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Affections as it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould
<PB N="8" REF="003624_0013_1002356C90ED1970">
as, by a <HI>Set Form of Publick Devotions</HI> rightly com|po&s;ed, as we are continually put in mind of all things nece&s;&s;ary for us to know or do, &s;o that is al|ways done by the &s;ame Words and Expre&s;&s;ions, which by their con&s;tant u&s;e will imprint the things them&s;elves &s;o firmly in our Minds, that it will be no ea&s;y matter to obliterate or raze them out; but do what we can they will &s;till occur upon all occa|&s;ions; which cannot but be very much for our <HI>Chri&s;|tian Edification.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, That which conduceth to the quick|ning our Souls, and to the rai&s;ing up our Affections in our publick Devotions, mu&s;t needs be acknow|ledged to conduce much to our <HI>Edification.</HI> But it is plain, That as to &s;uch purpo&s;es, a Set Form of Prayer is an extraordinary help to us; for if I hear another Pray, and know not before-hand what he will &s;ay, I mu&s;t fir&s;t li&s;ten to what he will &s;ay next; then I am to con&s;ider, whether what he &s;aith be agreeable to &s;ound Doctrine, and whether it be proper and lawful for me to joyn with him in the Petitions he puts up to God Almighty; and if I think it is &s;o, then I am to do it. But before I can well do that, he is got to another thing: By which means it is very difficult, if not morally impo&s;&s;i|ble, to joyn with him in every thing &s;o regularly as I ought to do. But by a <HI>Set Form of Prayer</HI> all this trouble is prevented; for having the Form con|tinually in my mind, being throughly acquainted with it, fully approving of every thing in it, and always knowing before hand what will come next, I have nothing el&s;e to do, whil&s;t the Words are &s;ounding in mine Ears, but to move my Heart and Affections &s;uitably to them, to rai&s;e up my De|&s;ires of tho&s;e good things which are prayed for, to fix my mind wholly upon God, whil&s;t I am prai&s;ing of him, and &s;o to employ, quicken, and lift up my whole Soul in performing my Devotions
<PB N="9" REF="003624_0014_1002357D4B53A0B0">
to him. No Man that hath been accu&s;tomed to a <HI>Set Form</HI> for any con&s;iderable time, but may ea&s;ily find this to be true by his own Experience: And by con&s;equence, that this way of Praying is a greater help to us, than they can imagine that never made tryal of it.</P>
<P>To this may be al&s;o added, That if we hear another praying a Prayer of his own private Com|po&s;ition or voluntary Effu&s;ion, our Minds are whol|ly bound up and confined to his Words and Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and to his Reque&s;ts and Petitions, be they what they will: &s;o that at the be&s;t we can but pray his Prayer. Whereas when we pray by a <HI>Form</HI> pre&s;cribed by the Church, we pray the Pray|ers of the whole Church we live in, which are common to the Mini&s;ter and People, to our &s;elves, and to all the Members of the &s;ame Church: So that we have all the devout and pious Souls that are in it, concurring and joining with us in them: which cannot &s;urely but be more effectual for the <HI>Edifying</HI> not only of our &s;elves in particular, but of the Church in general, than any private Prayer can be.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> IN order to our being <HI>edified</HI> by our pub|lick Devotions, as it is nece&s;&s;ary that we know be|fore-hand what we are to pray for, &s;o it is nece&s;|&s;ary that we afterwards know what we have pray|ed for, when we have done: For I &s;uppo&s;e you will all grant, that all the good and benefit we can receive from our Prayers, is to be ultimately re&s;olved into God's gracious hearing, and an&s;wer|ing of them: Without which they will all come to nothing.</P>
<P>BUT there are two things required to the obtain|ing an An&s;wer of our Prayers:</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003624_0015_1002356E1BD32B40"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THAT we &s;incerely and earne&s;tly de&s;ire good things at the Hands of God, to which, as I have &s;hewn, a <HI>Set Form of Prayer</HI> couduceth very much:</P>
<P>AND then,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT is required al&s;o, that we tru&s;t and depend up on God for his granting of them, ac|cording to the Promi&s;es which he hath made un|to us in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> And I verily be|lieve, that one great Rea&s;on why Men pray &s;o of|ten to no purpo&s;e, is, becau&s;e they do not take this cour&s;e: But when they have done their Prayers, they have done with them, and concern them&s;elves no more about them, than as if they had never prayed at all. But how can we expect that God &s;hould an&s;wer our Prayers when we our &s;elves do not mind whether he an&s;wers them or no? Nor believe and tru&s;t upon him for it? For certainly tru&s;ting in God, as it is one of the highe&s;t Acts of Religion that we can perform, &s;o it is that which gives Life and Vigour, Vertue and Efficacy to our Prayers, without which we have no ground at all to expect they &s;hould be an&s;wered: For God hav|ing promi&s;ed to an&s;wer our Prayers, except we tru&s;t on him for his performance of &s;uch Promi&s;es, we lo&s;e the Benefit of them, and by con&s;equence our Prayers too. And therefore, as ever we de&s;ire that he &s;hould grant us what we pray for, when we have <HI>directed our Prayers to him,</HI> we mu&s;t &s;till <HI>look up&punc; P&s;al.</HI> 5.3. expecting and hoping for the re|turn of them.</P>
<P>NOW as this is a thing of greater con&s;equence, &s;o a <HI>Set Form of Prayer</HI> is a greater help to us in it, than it is commonly thought to be. For if we hear another utter a Prayer <HI>ex tempore,</HI> which he
<PB N="11" REF="003624_0016_1002357ED847C648">
never &s;aid, nor we heard before, nor ever &s;hall do it again, it is much if he him&s;elf can remember the tenth part of what he &s;aid: How much le&s;s can we that heard him, do it? And if we cannot po&s;|&s;ibly remember what we prayed for, How is it po&s;|&s;ible for us to expect it at the Hands of God? or to depend upon him for it? But now it is quite otherwi&s;e when we u&s;e a <HI>Set Form of Prayer</HI>: For by this means, when we have prayed, we can re|collect our &s;elves, look over our Prayers again, either in a Book, or in our Minds, where they are im+printed; we can con&s;ider di&s;tinctly what we have asked at the Hands of God, and &s;o act our Faith and Confidence on him, for the granting every Petition we have put up unto him, according to the Promi&s;es which he hath made us to that pur|po&s;e. And as this is the &s;ure&s;t way whereby to obtain what we pray for, it mu&s;t needs be the mo&s;t <HI>Edifying</HI> way of Praying that we can po&s;&s;ibly u&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE Things being duly weighed, I &s;hall now take it for granted, That the u&s;ing a <HI>Form</HI> in <HI>general</HI> in the <HI>publick Wor&s;hip</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> is agreeable to this Apo&s;tolical Rule, <HI>Let all Things be done to Edifying</HI>; and &s;o &s;hall proceed to &s;hew, That that <HI>Form</HI> in particular, which <HI>our Church</HI> hath appointed to be u&s;ed upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, is &s;o too. For which end it is not nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould run through every particular Word, Phra&s;e or Expre&s;&s;ion in the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> much le&s;s that I &s;hould vindicate and defend it from every little Exception, that Ignorance and Malice may make again&s;t &s;omething in it. For nothing ever yet was, or can be &s;aid or written but &s;omething or other may be &s;aid or written again&s;t it, either well or ill. But my Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be to prove, That the <HI>Form of Divine Service</HI> contained in the Book of <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> which is now u&s;ed in the Church
<PB N="12" REF="003624_0017_1002356FC195B748" MS="y">
of <HI>England,</HI> conduceth &s;o much to the <HI>Edifying</HI> tho&s;e that u&s;e it, that it agrees exactly to the Rule which the Apo&s;tle here pre&s;cribes in that ca&s;e. And this I &s;hall demon&s;trate from four Heads.</P>

</LIST>
<P>FOR if it be <HI>Edifying</HI> in all the&s;e Re&s;pects, it mu&s;t needs be acknowledged to be &s;o in the whole. There being nothing in it but what may be reduced to &s;ome of the&s;e Heads.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THEREFORE as to the <HI>Language,</HI> you all know that the whole Service is performed in <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> the Vulgar and the common Language of the Nation, which every one under&s;tands, and &s;o may be <HI>Edified</HI> by it. And this, indeed, is the Ground and Foundation of all the Benefits that we can po&s;&s;ibly receive from our publick Prayers. And there|fore in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> the common People are made uncapable of being <HI>Edified</HI> by the Pray|ers of the Church, in that they are all made in <HI>Latin,</HI> a Language which they do not under&s;tand. So that when they meet to wor&s;hip God, there are &s;eldom any in the Congregation that knows what is &s;aid there, except the Prie&s;t that reads it, and oftentimes not he neither. By which means they have no &s;uch thing really among&s;t them as <HI>Common-Prayer.</HI> Neither is it po&s;&s;ible for the com|mon People to be ever <HI>Edified</HI> by what is there &s;aid, or done, except they could be once convin|ced by it of the horrible abu&s;e which their Church puts upon them; in commanding all her publick
<PB N="13" REF="003624_0018_1002358063728DF0">
Devotions to be performed in an unknown Tongue, directly contrary not only to the Rule in my Text, but to the De&s;ign of this whole Chapter.</P>
<P>BUT ble&s;&s;ed be God for it, it is not &s;o with us. For ours is truly <HI>Common-Prayer</HI>; for it is written and read in that Language which is <HI>common</HI> to all the Congregations in the Kingdom, and to every Per&s;on in each Congregation. So that all the Peo|ple of the Land, what&s;oever Rank or Condition they are of may joyn together in the u&s;e of every thing that is in it, and &s;o be jointly <HI>Edified</HI> by it: E&s;pecially, con&s;idering that it is not only all in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but in <HI>common</HI> and <HI>plain Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;uch as we u&s;e in our common Di&s;cour&s;e with one ano|ther. There are no unu&s;ual or ob&s;olete Words, no hard or uncouth. Phra&s;es in it, but every thing is expre&s;&s;ed as clearly and plainly as Words can do it. So that the meane&s;t Per&s;on in the Con|gregation, that under&s;tands but his Mother-Tongue, may be <HI>Edified</HI> by it, as well as the greate&s;t Scholar.</P>
<P>BUT that which is chiefly to be con&s;idered in the Language of the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> is, that it is not only <HI>common</HI> but <HI>proper</HI> too. Though the Words there u&s;ed are but common Words, yet they are &s;o u&s;ed&punc; that they <HI>properly</HI> expre&s;s the things that are de|&s;igned by them. This, I confe&s;s, may &s;eem to be no great matter at fir&s;t &s;ight, yet it is that with|out which we might be &s;ubverted, by that which was intended for our <HI>Edification.</HI> For impropriety of Speech in Matters of Religion, hath given oc|ca&s;ion to <HI>all,</HI> or <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the Schi&s;ms, Errors and Here&s;ies, that ever infe&s;ted this, or any other Church, as might ea&s;ily be demon&s;trated. Hence the A|po&s;tle gave <HI>Timothy, A Form of &s;ound Words,</HI> and charged him to hold it fa&s;t: <HI>Hold fa&s;t</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>the Form of &s;ound Words which thou ha&s;t heard of me,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.13. As knowing that except the
<PB N="14" REF="003624_0019_10023581F5FF8838" MS="y">
Words, whereby he u&s;ually expre&s;&s;ed Divine Truths, were &s;ound and proper, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for his Notions and Opinions of the Things them&s;elves to be &s;o. And certainly, if ever there was <HI>A Form of &s;ound Words,</HI> compo&s;ed by Men &s;ince the A|po&s;tles times, our <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> may ju&s;tly de&s;erve that Title; it being all made up of &s;uch fit and proper, &s;uch &s;ound and whol&s;ome Words, and if we do but hold fa&s;t to them, there is no fear of our falling, either into Here&s;ie, or Schi&s;m. For they being duly con&s;idered, will &s;ugge&s;t to our Minds, right and true Apprehen&s;ions of all the Articles of our Chri&s;tian Religion, and &s;o not only make us &s;ound, but build us up &s;trong and firm in our mo&s;t Holy Faith: So that con&s;idering the plainne&s;s and per&s;picuity, the &s;oundne&s;s and propriety of Speech which is u&s;ed in it, the lea&s;t that can be &s;aid of the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> is, that all Things in it are &s;o worded, as is mo&s;t for the <HI>Edifying</HI> of all tho&s;e that u&s;e it.</P>
<P>AND as the Words in the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> are all as <HI>Edifying</HI> as Words can be, &s;o in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, is the <HI>Matter</HI> expre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e Words. For there is nothing in it, but what is nece&s;&s;ary for our <HI>Edi|fication,</HI> and all things that are, or can be for our <HI>Edification,</HI> are plainly in it. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;ay there is nothing in our <HI>Liturgy</HI> but what is nece&s;&s;ary for our <HI>Edification.</HI> There are no &s;uch <HI>Fables</HI> in it, or <HI>End|le&s;s Genealogies,</HI> which (as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith) <HI>Mi|ni&s;ter Que&s;tions, rather than Godly Edifying, which is in Faith,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.4. There are none of tho&s;e vain Di&s;putations, and impertinent Controver&s;ies, which have of late been rai&s;ed in the Church, to its great Di&s;turbance, rather than its <HI>Edification.</HI> There are no new Opinions, nor airy Speculations in it, which &s;erve only to tickle Mens Ears, and plea&s;e their Fancies, and &s;o divert their Thoughts from what they are about.

and Partiality, con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly every thing that is in it, and you will find nothing a&s;&s;erted, but what is con&s;onant to God's Word, nothing prayed for, but according to his Promi&s;e, nothing required as a Duty, but what is agreeable to his Commands, nothing &s;aid or done, but what is grave and &s;ober, &s;olemn and &s;ub&s;tantial; nothing but what becomes the Wor&s;hip of our Great and Almighty Creator. And therefore, nothing but what we may &s;ome way or other be <HI>Edified</HI> by it.</P>
<P>AND as there is nothing in it, but what is <HI>Edi|fying,</HI> &s;o all Things that are or can be <HI>Edifying,</HI> are in it.

But there is nothing nece&s;&s;ary to be <HI>known</HI> or <HI>believed,</HI> but we are taught it; nothing nece&s;&s;ary to be <HI>done,</HI> but we are enjoined in it; nothing ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be <HI>obtained,</HI> but we pray for it in our <HI>pub|lick Form</HI> of <HI>Divine Service.</HI></P>
<P>FOR fir&s;t, As to tho&s;e things which are nece&s;&s;ary to be <HI>known,</HI> or <HI>believed,</HI> it is acknowledged by all <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> that they are fully contained in the <HI>Ho|ly Scriptures,</HI> which make a great, if not the great|e&s;t part of our <HI>Divine Service</HI>; and are con&s;tantly read over, the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> once every <HI>Month</HI> the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> once, and the <HI>New</HI> thrice every <HI>Year.</HI> And all the Fundamental Articles of our Chri&s;tian Faith, revealed in the Holy Scriptures, being briefly &s;um|med up in the <HI>Apo&s;tles Creed</HI>; that we may be &s;ure to keep them always in our Minds, we have that <HI>Creed</HI> read, and repeated always once, and mo&s;t com|monly twice every day in the <HI>Year.</HI> And &s;eeing the Godhead of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, the Founda|tion of our whole Religion, hath been, and &s;till is denied by &s;ome, left we &s;hould be led away with the Error of the Wicked, every Sunday and Holy-day
<PB N="16" REF="003624_0021_1002358487B674F0">
we read the <HI>Nicene Creed,</HI> wherein the God|head, both of the Son and Holy Gho&s;t, is a&s;&s;ert|ed and explained. And that we may not enter|tain any Erroneous Opinions concerning the mo&s;t Holy Trinity, or the Incarnation of the Son of God, but the true Catholick Faith whole, and undefiled, upon certain days every Year, we read that which is commonly called, <HI>The Creed of St.</HI> Athana&s;ius, wherein tho&s;e great My&s;teries are unfolded, in the mo&s;t proper and per&s;picuous terms that they are ca|pable of.</P>
<P>AND as all things nece&s;&s;ary to be believed, are &s;ummarily contained in the <HI>Three Creeds,</HI> &s;o they are frequently explained in the other parts of our <HI>Li|turgy</HI>; In&s;omuch, that it would be ea&s;y to frame a <HI>compleat Body of Divinity</HI> out of the Words there u|&s;ed: At lea&s;t of all &s;uch things as are needful for any Man in the World to believe or know, in or|der to his <HI>Eternal Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ame may be &s;aid al&s;o of all tho&s;e things which we ought to do: For, as we here do what|&s;oever is nece&s;&s;ary to be done, in order to our Wor|&s;hip of God in this place, &s;o we here are taught what&s;oever is nece&s;&s;ary to be learnt, in order to our &s;erving God in all other places. So that no Man that frequents our publick Congregations, where the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> is u&s;ed, can ever plead Ignorance of any one Duty what&s;oever: For if it be not his own Fault, he may there be in&s;tructed in every thing which he that made him requires of him. For here, as I ob&s;erved before, we con&s;tantly read the Ho|ly Scripture, which as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Is profita|ble for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;tructi|on in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the Man of God may be per|fect, throughly in&s;tructed unto all good Works,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. And &s;eeing it hath plea&s;ed the Mo&s;t High God to compri&s;e his whole Will, and by con|&s;equence
<PB N="17" REF="003624_0022_100235A796F0C998">
our Duty, in the <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> hence we read them con&s;tantly every Sunday and Holy|day throughout the whole Year: By which means every one, that doth not wilfully &s;hut his Eyes, may clearly &s;ee, and fully under&s;tand, his whole Duty, both to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man.</HI> E&s;pecially con&s;idering that in your Prayers them&s;elves al&s;o, there is frequent mention made of all tho&s;e Vices which ought to be avoided, and of all tho&s;e good Works which ought to be performed by us. So that we can never come to Church, but we are &s;till put in mind, both of <HI>what we ought,</HI> and <HI>what we ought not</HI> to do, that we may be &s;aved.</P>
<P>AND then, as there is nothing nece&s;&s;ary to be <HI>known,</HI> or <HI>done,</HI> but we are taught it; &s;o neither is there any thing nece&s;&s;ary to be <HI>obtained,</HI> to make us either Holy, or Happy, but we pray for it in the <HI>Common-Prayer.</HI> For here we have the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> a Prayer compo&s;ed by Wi&s;dom it &s;elf; and there|fore it mu&s;t needs be the mo&s;t perfect and Divine Prayer that ever was made. Neither do we u&s;e it on|ly once, but in every di&s;tinct Service of the Church, in our Prayers before we read the Holy Scripture, and in our Prayers after; towards the end of the <HI>Litany,</HI> and in the beginning of the <HI>Communion</HI> Ser|vice, and in every Office of the Church be&s;ides. And the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e although our Saviour hath not forbidden us to u&s;e any other Prayer&punc; yet he hath expre&s;ly commanded us to &s;ay this, when&s;oever we pray. And therefore, in obedience to his Com|mand, our Church hath wi&s;ely ordered, that in all, and in every Solemn Addre&s;s that we make to the mo&s;t High God, we always &s;ay this Prayer, le&s;t o|therwi&s;e, by our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his Command, in omitting this, we make all our other Prayers to be ineffectual. And be&s;ides, by the con&s;tant u&s;e of this among&s;t our other Prayers, we are always &s;ure to u&s;e one Prayer, both ab&s;olutely perfect in it &s;elf, and
<PB N="18" REF="003624_0023_100235879B088C28">
mo&s;t acceptable unto him, to whom we pray; it being a Prayer of his own Compo&s;ure: So that we &s;peak unto God in his own Words, and &s;o may be confident, that we ask nothing of him, but exactly according to his own Will.</P>
<P>AND though all things nece&s;&s;ary for us be vir|tually contained in the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> yet our Church, in Conformity to the Catholick and Apo&s;tolical, hath thought good to add &s;ome other Prayers, in which the &s;ame things are more particularly expre&s;&s;ed and de&s;ired, at the hands of our great and mo&s;t boun|tiful Benefactor. All which are &s;o contrived, that there is nothing Evil, or Hurtful for us, but we pray again&s;t it; nothing Good, or U&s;eful, but we pray for it. There is no Vice, or Lu&s;t, but we de|&s;ire it may be &s;ubdued under us: No Grace or Vertue, but we pray it may be planted and grow in us. In&s;omuch, that if we do but con&s;tantly and &s;incerely pray over all tho&s;e Prayers, and &s;tedfa&s;tly believe and tru&s;t in God for his an&s;wering of them, and &s;o obtain what we there pray for, we cannot but be as real and true Saints, as happy and ble&s;|&s;ed Creatures, as it is po&s;&s;ible for us to be in this World. Neither do we here pray for our &s;elves only, but according to the Apo&s;tle's Advice, we make <HI>Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of Thanks for all Men</HI>; yea, <HI>for our very Enemies,</HI> as our Saviour hath commanded us, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.44. And what can be de&s;ired more than all this, to make the Matter of the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> Edifying, either to our &s;elves or others? Nothing certainly, but Truth and Sincerity of Heart in the u&s;ing of it.</P>
<P>I cannot pa&s;s from this Head, before I have ob|&s;erved one thing more unto you, concerning the Prayers in general, and that is&punc; That they are not carried on in one continued Di&s;cour&s;e, but divided into many &s;hort Prayers, or Collects, &s;uch as that
<PB N="19" REF="003624_0024_100235A9F4B4C858">
is, which our Lord him&s;elf compo&s;ed; and that might be one Rea&s;on, wherefore our Church &s;o or|dered it, that &s;o &s;he might follow our Lord's Ex|ample in it, who be&s;t knew what kind of Prayers were fitte&s;t for us to u&s;e. And indeed, we cannot but all find, by our own Experience, how difficult it is to keep our Minds long intent upon any thing, much more upon &s;o great things as the Object and Subject of our Prayers are&punc; but do what we can, we are &s;till liable to Di&s;tractions: So that there is a kind of nece&s;&s;ity to break off &s;ometimes, to give our &s;elves a breathing time, that our Thoughts be|ing loofned for a while, they may with more ea&s;e, and le&s;s Danger of Di&s;traction, be tied up again, as it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be, all the while that we are actually praying to the Supreme Being of the World.</P>
<P>BESIDES that, in order to the performing our De|votions aright to the mo&s;t High God, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that our Souls be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all along with due Apprehen&s;ions of his Greatne&s;s and Glory. To which purpo&s;e our &s;hort Prayers contribute very much: For every one of them beginning with &s;ome of the Properties or Perfections of God, and &s;o &s;ugge&s;ting to our Minds right Apprehen&s;i|ons of him at fir&s;t, it is ea&s;y to pre&s;erve them in our Minds during the &s;pace of a &s;hort Prayer, which in a long one would be apt to &s;catter and vani&s;h away.</P>
<P>BUT that which I look upon as one of the principal Rea&s;ons, why our <HI>publick Devotions</HI> are, and &s;hould be divided into &s;hort Collects is this: Our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, we know, hath often told us&punc; That what&s;oever we ask in his Name, we &s;hall receive: And &s;o hath directed us in all our Pray|ers to make u&s;e of his Name, and to ask nothing but upon the Account of his Merit and Mediati|on
<PB N="20" REF="003624_0025_1002358927B01860" MS="y">
for us; upon which all our Hopes and Ex|pectations from God do wholly and &s;olely depend. Hence therefore, (as it always was, &s;o) it cannot but be judged nece&s;&s;ary, that the Name of Chri&s;t be frequently in&s;erted in our Prayers, that &s;o we may lift up our Hearts unto him, and act our Faith upon him for our obtaining the good things we pray for. And &s;o we &s;ee it is in the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> for what&s;oever it is we ask of God, we pre|&s;ently add, <HI>Through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> or &s;ome|thing to that purpo&s;e. And &s;o ask nothing but ac|cording to our Lord's Direction, even in his Name. And this is the rea&s;on that ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> our Prayers &s;o &s;hort: for take away the Conclu&s;ion of every Col|lect or Prayer, <HI>In the Name of Chri&s;t,</HI> and you may join them all together, and make them but as one continued Prayer. But this would be to offer manife&s;t Violence to the Prayers, by taking a|way that which gives them all their Force and Energy, and &s;o making them ineffectual to the pur|po&s;es for which they are u&s;ed. For certainly the asking all things in the Name of Chri&s;t, as we do in the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> is the only way whereby to obtain what we de&s;ire, and by con&s;e|quence, the mo&s;t <HI>Edifying Way</HI> of Praying in the World.</P>
<P>THE next thing to be con&s;idered in the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> is the <HI>Method,</HI> which is admirable, and as <HI>E|difying,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, as the <HI>Matter</HI> it &s;elf. This none can deny, that doth but fully under&s;tand, and &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider of it. Which therefore, that you may all do, I &s;hall briefly run through the whole, and give you what Light I can into it, that you may clearly &s;ee, not only the Rea&s;onablene&s;s, but the Ex|cellency of it all along.</P>

And they are all &s;uch <HI>Sentences</HI> as put us in mind of our &s;ins again&s;t him, and of his promi&s;e to pardon them if we do repent: That &s;o we may pre&s;ent and car|ry our &s;elves with that Reverence and Godly Fear before him, as becometh tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ible of their own Vilene&s;s and Unworthine&s;s to approach &s;o great a Maje&s;ty: And likewi&s;e, with that Faith and humble Confidence, which becometh tho&s;e who believe, that he upon our Repentance will pardon our Sins, and accept both our Per&s;ons and Perfor|mances, according to the Promi&s;es which he hath made unto us.</P>
<P>THEN follows a grave <HI>Exhortation,</HI> concerning the end of our pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embling, which is of great U&s;e, and ought never to be omitted. For Men generally are apt to ru&s;h into the Pre&s;ence of God, without ever con&s;idering what they go about Whereas, this <HI>Exhortation</HI> puts us upon con&s;ider|ing the greatne&s;s of the Work which we are now ingaged in, and &s;o upon compo&s;ing our Thoughts,
<PB N="22" REF="003624_0027_1002358AF328AA18">
and preparing our &s;elves for the due performance of it.</P>
<P>OUR Minds being thus brought into a right Frame and Temper for it, we all, both Mini&s;ter and Peo|ple, pro&s;trate our &s;elves before the mo&s;t high God, <HI>Confe&s;&s;ing</HI> upon our Knees, the manifold Sins and Wickedne&s;s that we have committed again&s;t him. Which <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> is &s;o contrived, that all, and e|very Per&s;on in any Congregation what&s;oever, may join in it. For it runs in general Terms: And yet &s;o too, that every particular Per&s;on may and ought in his own mind to confe&s;s and acknowledge his own Sins, which he knows him&s;elf to be guil|ty of. As where we &s;ay, <HI>We have left undone tho&s;e things which we ought to have done, and we have done tho&s;e things which we ought not to have done.</HI> At the &s;aying of this every one &s;hould call his own Sins to remembrance, and what Duties he knows him|&s;elf to have omitted, and what Vices he knows him|&s;elf to have committed, and confe&s;s them according|ly unto God. And when we have thus confe&s;&s;ed our Sins to God, we pre&s;ently implore his Mercy in the pardon of them, and his Grace, that for the future we may for&s;ake them.</P>
<P>AND whil&s;t we are thus upon our Knees, hum|bly confe&s;&s;ing and bewailing our Sins before the Lord our God, the Mini&s;ter &s;tands up, and in the Name of God, declares and pronounceth to all tho&s;e who truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his Go&s;pel, <HI>The Ab&s;olution and Remi&s;&s;ion of all their Sins</HI> Which though &s;poken al&s;o in general Terms, yet every particular Per&s;on there pre&s;ent, ought to ap|ply it to him&s;elf, &s;o as to be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind, that if he doth but &s;incerely repent, and believe the Go&s;pel, he is perfectly ab&s;olved from all his Sins by God him&s;elf, according to the Promi&s;es
<PB N="23" REF="003624_0028_100235ADD6444588">
which he hath made to Mankind in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>AND now looking upon our &s;elves as <HI>ab&s;olved</HI> from our Sins, upon our Repentance and Faith in Chri&s;t, and by con&s;equence, as reconciled to God, we take the boldne&s;s to call him Father&punc; humbly addre&s;&s;ing our &s;elves to him in that <HI>Divine Form</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> which he him&s;elf hath given us. Which done, we lift up our Hearts and Voices unto God, for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance of us in what we do, in the words of <HI>David,</HI> the Mini&s;ter crying out, <HI>O Lord, open thou our Lips,</HI> and the People an&s;wering, <HI>And our Mouths &s;hall &s;hew forth thy Prai&s;e.</HI> The Mi|ni&s;ter again, <HI>O God make &s;peed to &s;ave us,</HI> the Peo|ple, <HI>O Lord, make ha&s;t to help us.</HI> And them im|mediately we all lift up our Bodies to &s;tand upon our Feet, and &s;o put our &s;elves into a po&s;ture of Prai&s;ing and Magnifying the Eternal God, Fa|ther, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, for his infinite Good|ne&s;s and Mercy towards us; for which purpo&s;e the Mini&s;ter fir&s;t &s;aith, or &s;ings, the <HI>Gloria Patri, Glory be, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>; and the People to &s;hew their Con|&s;ent, an&s;wer, <HI>As it was in the Beginning, is now, and ever &s;hall be: World without end.</HI> Amen. But not thinking this to be enough, the Mini&s;ter calls upon the People again, &s;aying, <HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord,</HI> and the People an&s;wer, <HI>The Lord's Name be prai&s;ed</HI>; and then we go on to prai&s;e him to|gether, &s;aying, or &s;inging, the Ninety-fifth <HI>P&s;alm, Venite exultemus Domino, O come let us &s;ing unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoice in the &s;trength of our Salvation,</HI> &amp;c. And &s;o proceed to the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> ap|pointed for the Day. After every one of which, to te&s;tify our Belief in the mo&s;t Sacred Trinity, and our acknowledgment of that infinite Love and
<PB N="24" REF="003624_0029_1002358E98DE2660">
Goodne&s;s, which every one of tho&s;e Divine Per&s;ons hath manife&s;ted to us, we repeat that incomparable Hymn, <HI>Glory be to the Father,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>OUR Hearts being thus rai&s;ed up to God in prai&s;ing and admiring of him, we are now in a fit Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition to hear what he &s;hall &s;peak unto us. And therefore have a Chapter read out of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI>; and that in its ordinary cour&s;e, except upon Sundays and Holydays, when more people attending the publick Wor&s;hip of God, than can conveniently come upon other days, we read &s;ome &s;elect Chapter proper for the day, and &s;uch as is judged mo&s;t <HI>edifying</HI> to all that are there pre&s;ent. And having thus heard God &s;peaking unto us in his Holy Word, we pre&s;ently fall upon prai|&s;ing of him again, for &s;o un&s;peakable a Mercy, &s;aying, or &s;inging in the Morning, the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> one of the mo&s;t Heavenly and Seraphick Hymns that was ever compo&s;ed by Men: Or el&s;e, the <HI>Song of the three Children,</HI> which is nothing but a Para|phra&s;e upon that which <HI>David</HI> &s;ang &s;o often upon Earth, and which the Holy Angels &s;ing continual|ly in Heaven, even <HI>Hallelujah, Prai&s;e ye the Lord.</HI> Wherein we being all &s;en&s;ible how far &s;hort we our &s;elves come of prai&s;ing God &s;ufficiently, we call upon all the Creatures of the World to do it, <HI>Ble&s;s ye the Lord, prai&s;e him and magnifie him for ever.</HI> In the Afternoon, we &s;ing either the <HI>Magnificat,</HI> or el&s;e the Ninety eighth <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> both which being taken out of God's own Word, cannot but be very plea|&s;ing and acceptable unto him.</P>
<P>AFTER this, our Soul being got upon the Wing again, and &s;oaring aloft in the Contemplation of the Divine Perfections, we are now rightly qualified to hear and receive the Sublime My&s;teries of the <HI>Go&s;|pel.</HI> And therefore have a Chapter read to us out of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament.</HI> After which, we being revived
<PB N="25" REF="003624_0030_100235AF73434A80">
with the good tidings of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and filled with admiration at the infinite Goodne&s;s of God therein revealed to us, we break forth again into Prai&s;ing and Adoring of him, in the Song of <HI>Zacharias,</HI> or el&s;e the hundredth <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> in the Morning; and at Evening, either the Sixty &s;eventh <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> or el&s;e the Song of <HI>Old Simeon,</HI> &s;till concluding with <HI>Gloria Patri.</HI></P>
<P>NOW having thus heard &s;ome part of the Word of God read to us, and expre&s;&s;ed our Thankfulne&s;s unto him for it, to &s;ignify our A&s;&s;ent, not only to what we have heard, but to the whole Scripture, we all with one Heart and Voice repeat the <HI>Apo&s;tles Creed,</HI> wherein the Sum and Sub&s;tance of it is con|tained. And &s;o profe&s;s our &s;elves to continue in the number of Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples, and that as we were at fir&s;t Baptized, &s;o we &s;till believe in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>God</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed for evermore.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have been mo&s;tly taken up with Confe&s;&s;ing our Sins to <HI>God,</HI> imploring his Mercy in the Pardon of them, hearing his mo&s;t Holy Word, acknowledging his Goodne&s;s to us, and prai&s;ing and magnifying his Name for it. By which means, ex|cept we have been extreamly wanting to our &s;elves, our Hearts cannot but be &s;o united and fixed upon <HI>God,</HI> that we are now rightly di&s;po&s;ed to make known our Wants, and pre&s;ent our Petitions before him. This therefore is the next thing we &s;et upon: But &s;eeing that neither Mini&s;ter nor People can po&s;&s;ibly do it aright, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf, therefore each of them fir&s;t pray for his &s;pecial Pre|&s;ence with the other. The one &s;aying, <HI>The Lord be with you,</HI> the other, <HI>And with thy Spirit.</HI> And then immediately falling down upon our Knees, we A|dore and Supplicate each Per&s;on of the mo&s;t Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity to have mercy upon us, <HI>Lord have mercy up|on
<PB N="26" REF="003624_0031_10023590E9F67A38">
us, Chri&s;t have mercy upon us, Lord have mercy up|on us.</HI> After which we Addre&s;s our &s;elves to <HI>God</HI> in the Words that he hath put into our Mouths, &s;aying the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>Prayer</HI>; which ended, the Mini&s;ter and People, by turns lift up their Hearts to <HI>God</HI> in &s;ome &s;hort and heavenly Ejaculations, &s;triving as it were to out-vye each other in prevailing with the Al|mighty to pour down his Ble&s;&s;ings upon us. And then, in an humble and &s;olemn manner, we join together in &s;upplicating his Divine Maje&s;ty for his Grace and Favour, his Defence and Protection, his Mercy, and Ble&s;&s;ing, for our <HI>&s;elves,</HI> for the <HI>King,</HI> for the <HI>Royal Family,</HI> for his <HI>Church,</HI> and for all <HI>Man|kind.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus we do ordinarily in the Collects appoin|ted for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT upon <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Fridays</HI> (upon which days the Primitive Church u&s;ed to perform their more than ordinary Devotions) as al&s;o upon the <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> in the Morning, we do it in the <HI>Litany,</HI> and in &s;uch a <HI>Litany</HI> as comprehends all, and every thing that we can ever need to de&s;ire of <HI>Almighty God,</HI> either for our &s;elves or others.</P>
<P>AFTER this, upon Sundays and Holy-days, we pro|ceed to the <HI>Communion-Service</HI>: And therefore, ap|proaching to the Lord's Table, we begin it with his own Prayer. And after another &s;hort Prayer to <HI>God</HI> to clean&s;e the Thoughts of our Hearts by the In&s;pi|ration of his Holy Spirit, we read the <HI>Ten Command|ments,</HI> which he hath enjoyn'd us to ob&s;erve; and after every Commandment we ask <HI>God</HI> Mercy for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion thereof, for the time pa&s;t, and Grace to keep the &s;ame for the time to come; &s;aying, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us, and incline our Hearts to keep this Law.</HI> And then, after a Prayer for the <HI>King,</HI> and the Collect for the day, we read the <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> and
<PB N="27" REF="003624_0032_100235B28ABFF7E8">
<HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> that is, mo&s;t commonly, a &s;hort Paragraph taken out of the Canonical <HI>Epi&s;tles,</HI> and another out of one of the Holy <HI>Go&s;pels,</HI> which was the antient way of reading the Scripture, before it was divided into Chapters And we do it now to prepare us the better for the <HI>Communion</HI> of the Body and Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> therein revealed to us. But &s;eeing we nei|ther do, nor can read over the whole, we repeat the &s;ub&s;tance of it in the <HI>Nicene Creed,</HI> which it is very nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould do at this time, that &s;o we may demon&s;trate our &s;elves to be Chri&s;tians, and &s;o capable of receiving the mo&s;t holy <HI>Com|munion.</HI></P>
<P>He that all this while hath employed him&s;elf as he ought to do in the Service of our Church, can|not but find him&s;elf &s;trangely <HI>edified</HI> by it. Yet how&s;oever, that nothing may be wanting that may any way conduce to our <HI>Edification,</HI> after the <HI>Nicene Creed,</HI> our Church hath appointed a <HI>Sermon</HI> to be Preached, which if &s;ound, plain and practical, as it ought to be, cannot but be very <HI>edifying</HI> too.</P>
<P>And now we may be well &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o far <HI>Edified,</HI> as to be rai&s;ed up to the highe&s;t pitch of Devotion that we can arrive at in this World, and &s;o are fit to be admitted to the <HI>highe&s;t Ordi|nance</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> the <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI> And therefore we now betake our &s;elves to it. But that we may not appear before our Lord empty, we fir&s;t offer up &s;omething to him of what he hath be&s;towed upon us, to be di&s;po&s;'d of to Pious and Charitable U&s;es; te&s;tifying thereby our acknowledgment of his Goodne&s;s to us, and that we have nothing but what we receive from him. And to excite and encourage us to do this, all the while that we are offering, we have &s;ome &s;elect Sentences of Scripture read to us, wherein God either commands us to be Charitable, or el&s;e
<PB N="28" REF="003624_0033_100235929AF5D718">
promi&s;eth a Ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e that are &s;o. And then we pray <HI>for Chri&s;t's whole Church Militant here on Earth,</HI> whereby we profe&s;s our &s;elves to be real Members of it, and de&s;irous to hold Communion with it in Chri&s;t's My&s;tical Body and Blood. And &s;o we proceed to the celebration of it; in which the <HI>Method</HI> is &s;o clear, &s;o apparently <HI>Edifying,</HI> that I need not &s;ay any thing of it. But &s;hall only ob&s;erve <HI>two</HI> things in General concerning it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THAT the <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> being the highe&s;t My&s;tery in all our Religion, as Repre&s;enting the Death of the Son of God to us, hence that place where the <HI>Sacrament</HI> is Admini|&s;tred, was always made and reputed the highe&s;t place in the Church. And therefore al&s;o it was wont to be &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the Church by a Skreen or Partition of Net-work, in Latin <HI>Cancelli,</HI> and that &s;o generally, that from thence the place it &s;elf is called the <HI>Chancel.</HI> That this was antiently ob&s;erved in the Building of all con|&s;iderable Churches (for I &s;peak not of private Ora|tories or Chapels) within few Centuries after the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, even in the days of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, as well as in all Ages &s;ince, I could ea&s;ily demon&s;trate from the Records of tho&s;e Times. But having purpo&s;ely waved Antiquity hitherto, I am loath to trouble you with it now. But I men|tion it at pre&s;ent, only becau&s;e &s;ome perhaps may wonder why this &s;hould be ob&s;erved in our Church, rather than in all the other Churches which have been lately built in this City, Whereas they &s;hould rather wonder, why it was not ob&s;erved in all o|thers as well as this. For be&s;ides our Obligations to conform as much as may be to the Practice of the Univer&s;al Church, and to avoid Novelty and Singularity in all things relating to the Wor&s;hip of God, it cannot be ea&s;ily imagin'd, that the <HI>Catholick Church</HI> in all Ages and Places for 13 or
<PB N="29" REF="003624_0034_100235B419292980">
1400 Years together, &s;hould ob&s;erve &s;uch a Cu&s;tom as this, except there were great Rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>WHAT they were, it is not nece&s;&s;ary for us to enquire now. It may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve at pre|&s;ent, that the <HI>Chancel</HI> in our Chri&s;tian Churches was always looked upon, as an&s;werable to the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> in the Temple, which, you know, was &s;e|parated from the Sanctuary or Body of the Temple, by the Command of God him&s;elf. And that this place being appropriated to the <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> it ought to be contrived, as may be mo&s;t convenient for tho&s;e who are to partake of that Ble&s;&s;ed Ordinance. But it mu&s;t needs be more con|venient for tho&s;e who are to enjoy <HI>Communion</HI> with Chri&s;t, and in him with one another, in this <HI>Holy Sacrament,</HI> to meet together, as one Body, in one Place, &s;eparated for that purpo&s;e, than to be di&s;per|&s;ed, as otherwi&s;e they would be, &s;ome in one and &s;ome in another part of the Church. Or in &s;hort, it is much better for the place to be &s;eparate, than the People.</P>
<P>Furthermore, IT is not only convenient, but in &s;ome Sen&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, for every <HI>Communicant</HI> to ob&s;erve and take &s;pecial Notice of the &s;everal Circum&s;tances which our Lord hath ordained to be u&s;ed in this <HI>Sacrament,</HI> as the Breaking of the Bread, and the Con&s;ecrating both that and the Wine, to repre&s;ent his Death, the breaking of his Body, and the &s;hed|ding of his Blood for our Sins; that &s;o our Hearts may be the more affected with it, and by con&s;e|quence our Souls more <HI>Edified</HI> by it. But this can|not be &s;o well done, except there be a place &s;et a|part for it, where they may all be placed, about or near the <HI>Communion Table,</HI> and &s;o behold what is there done at the Con&s;ecration of the Elements. Hence al&s;o it is, that the Seats there, are and ought o be &s;o ordered, that all that are in them may &s;till
<PB N="30" REF="003624_0035_100235942B09DA50" MS="y">
look that way, and contemplate upon their Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, there evidently &s;et forth as crucified for them.</P>
<P>THE other thing that I would ob&s;erve unto you concerning the <HI>Holy Communion,</HI> is this, that our Church requireth, or at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;eth it to be ad|mini&s;tred every Lord's Day, and every Holy-day throughout the Year, as it was in the Primitive Church. For that is the Rea&s;on that the <HI>Commu|nion Service</HI> is appointed to be u&s;ed upon all &s;uch Days, and to be read at the Communion Table, that &s;o the Mini&s;ter may be there ready to Admi|ni&s;ter it unto all that de&s;ire to partake of it. Which &s;hews the great Care that our Church hath of all her Members, that they might be <HI>edified</HI> and <HI>con|firmed</HI> in the Faith; to which nothing contributes more, that <HI>frequent Communion</HI> at our Lord's Table. Which if People could once be per&s;uaded to, they would &s;oon find greater Benefit by it than I can expre&s;s, or they them&s;elves, till then, imagine. I &s;hall &s;ay no more of it at pre&s;ent, but only this, That I am &s;o &s;en&s;ible of what I now &s;ay, that could I be &s;ure to have a &s;ufficient Number of Com|municants, I &s;hould be heartily glad to Admini&s;ter the <HI>Holy Sacrament</HI> every <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> both for their &s;akes, and my own too.</P>
<P>THUS I have given you a &s;hort Scheme of that Excellent Method wherein our <HI>Divine Service</HI> is performed; which who&s;over rightly con&s;iders, will need no other Argument to convince him, that it is, according to the Apo&s;tle's Rule, very <HI>Edifying</HI> in|deed. The la&s;t thing to be con&s;idered in it, is the Manner of its Performance; by which I mean only the &s;everal Po&s;tures of the Body, as <HI>&s;tanding</HI> and <HI>kneeling,</HI> which are u&s;ed in it: for they are al&s;o done to <HI>Edifying.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003624_0036_100235B6ABC0AB18">WHILE we &s;ay or &s;ing the <HI>Hymns</HI> or <HI>P&s;alms</HI> to the Prai&s;e and Glory of God, we <HI>&s;tand</HI> up, not only to &s;ignifie, but to excite the Elevation of our Minds at that time. For as on the one hand, if our Souls be really lift up in the Prai&s;es of God, our Bodies will naturally lift up them&s;elves, to accom|pany them as far as they can towards Heaven; &s;o on the other hand, the rai&s;ing up of our Bodies helps towards the rai&s;ing up of our Souls too, by putting us in mind of that High and Heavenly Work we are now about; wherein, according to our weak Capacities, we join with the Choir of Heaven in prai&s;ing God now, as we hope to do it for evermore. For this Cau&s;e al&s;o we <HI>&s;tand</HI> at the <HI>Creeds,</HI> for they being Confe&s;&s;ions of our Faith in God, as &s;uch they come under the proper Notions of Hymns, or Songs of Prai&s;e to him. All our prai&s;ing God being really nothing el&s;e but our con|fe&s;&s;ing and acknowledging him to be what he is in him&s;elf and to us. And be&s;ides that, by our <HI>&s;tanding</HI> at the Creeds and Go&s;pels, we &s;ignifie our A&s;&s;ent unto them, and our readine&s;s to defend them to the utmo&s;t of our Power, again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition what|&s;oever. And as for the Go&s;pels particularly, they contain the very Acts which our Lord did, and the very Words which he &s;pake when he was up|on Earth; and therefore we who profe&s;s him to be our Lord and Ma&s;ter, cannot &s;urely but <HI>&s;tand</HI> up, when we hear him &s;peaking, and li&s;ten diligently to tho&s;e gracious Words which proceed out of his Divine Mouth.</P>
<P>AND as when we prai&s;e God, we rai&s;e up our &s;elves as high as we can towards Heaven, &s;o when we pray unto him, we fall down as low as we can towards the Earth, not daring to pre&s;ent our Sup|plications to the ab&s;olute Monarch of the whole World, any other ways than upon our <HI>Knees.</HI> Which
<PB N="32" REF="003624_0037_10023597157BE0C0">
is &s;o proper, &s;o natural a Po&s;ture of Supplicants, that if all Men would but duly con&s;ider what they do when they pray to Almighty God, the Church need never have commanded them to <HI>kneel</HI> at that time. For they could not choo&s;e but do it: No, not although the place where they are, &s;hould &s;eem never &s;o inconvenient for it. For we find our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf <HI>kneeling</HI> at his Prayer in the Garden, upon the <HI>bare Ground, Luk.</HI> 22.41. and St. <HI>Paul</HI> upon the <HI>Sea-&s;hore,</HI> where he could have no other Cu&s;hion but <HI>Stones</HI> or <HI>Sand, Acts</HI> 21.5. How&s;o|ever, to take off all tho&s;e little Excu&s;es that Men are apt to make for them&s;elves in this ca&s;e, the Seats in this Church are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, and all things &s;o prepared in them, that there can be no Incon|venience at all in it, but rather all the Conveni|ences for <HI>Kneeling</HI> that can be de&s;ired. And there|fore if any one of you &s;hall neglect to <HI>kneel,</HI> while the Prayers are read, they will give us too much Cau&s;e to call their Religion into Que&s;tion, or to &s;u&s;pect they have none at all. For if they had, they dur&s;t not, they could not offer &s;uch a mani|fe&s;t Affront to the great Creator of the World, as to carry them&s;elves no otherwi&s;e while they pray to him, than as if they were conver&s;ing with their Fellow Creatures. But why do I &s;peak of their praying unto God! It is too much to be feared they do not pray at all, nor come to Church for any better purpo&s;e, than only to &s;ee and be &s;een. I am &s;ure they perform no Act of external Wor|&s;hip of Adoration unto God, nor &s;hew him that Re&s;pect and Reverence which is due unto him; and &s;o give very great Offence to all pious and devout Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>WHEREAS if all and every Per&s;on in the Con|gregation would always be upon their <HI>Knees,</HI> while they put up their Petitions to the mo&s;t High God, what a mighty Advantage would this be, not only
<PB N="33" REF="003624_0038_100235B914866118">
to every one in particular, but to the whole Con|gregation in general? For as every one would by this means keep his Heart more &s;tedfa&s;t in the true Fear and Dread of God, and likewi&s;e more certainly obtain the good things he prays for, as the Fathers frequently a&s;&s;ert, &s;o the whole Congrega|tion al&s;o would be very much <HI>edified</HI> by it. For by this means we &s;hould excite and inflame each o|thers Devotions, confirm and &s;trengthen one an|others Faith, and convince both our &s;elves and all that &s;ee us, that Religion is indeed a &s;erious thing; and that we believe it to be &s;o, by our &s;erving God with &s;o much <HI>Reverence and godly Fear,</HI> as this humble Po&s;ture repre&s;enteth. And therefore as you tender the Love of God, the Credit of Religion, or the Salvation of your own Souls, I be&s;eech you all, in the Name of him who made you, that when&s;oever you come hither to pray unto him, you do it in that awful, lowly, and &s;olemn man|ner, which our Church commandeth, and as be|cometh Creatures, when you &s;peak to your Great and Almighty Creator; that &s;o you may give true Wor&s;hip and Honour unto him, and al&s;o receive that Benefit and <HI>Edification</HI> to your &s;elves, which he hath promi&s;ed, and you expect from your publick Prayers. This being certainly the mo&s;t <HI>Edifying</HI> Po&s;ture that you can po&s;&s;ibly u&s;e upon &s;uch Occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been hitherto di&s;cour&s;ed con|cerning the <HI>Language,</HI> the <HI>Matter,</HI> the <HI>Method,</HI> and the <HI>Manner</HI> of performing <HI>Divine Service,</HI> as con|tained and pre&s;cribed in the Book of <HI>Common-Prayer</HI>; we may po&s;itively conclude, that it agrees exactly with the Rule in my Text, even that <HI>All things in it are done to Edifying</HI>: Which was the Thing I undertook to prove. I know that many ther Arguments might be brought to &s;hew the Excellency and U&s;efulne&s;s of the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI>;
<PB N="34" REF="003624_0039_1002359A2BDACE80">
but the&s;e already produced, are &s;ufficient to convince any &s;ober and con&s;idering Chri&s;tian of it. And if there be any here pre&s;ent, who are not yet con|vinced by what they have heard of it, I de&s;ire only one thing of them, and that is, That they would make Tryal of it for a while For my Charity prompts me to believe, that all the Zeal that &s;ome expre&s;s again&s;t the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> and all that Indifferency that is in others for it, pro|ceeds only from their Ignorance of what it is, or at lea&s;t from their want of an Experimental Know|ledge of it. For let any Man that &s;eriou&s;ly minds the Wor&s;hip of God, and the Salvation of his Soul, before all things el&s;e, let &s;uch a one, I &s;ay, &s;et him&s;elf in good earne&s;t to u&s;e the <HI>Common Pray|er,</HI> as he ought to do, for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, and I not doubt but that by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, he will find that benefit and <HI>Edification</HI> by it, that his own Experience &s;hall convince him of all that I have now &s;aid, more than all the Arguments that I have, or any Man in the World can ever produce to him. Some perhaps may think this to be a Paradox; but I do not que&s;tion but that many here pre&s;ent can atte&s;t it upon their own Knowledge; having found them&s;elves more confirmed in their Faith, more &s;ettled in their Religion, more hum|bled for their Sins, more &s;upported under their Troubles, more inflam'd with Love to God and De&s;ires of Heaven, every way more <HI>Edifi'd</HI> by the con&s;tant u&s;e of the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> than they could ever have believed it po&s;&s;ible to have been, except they had found it to have been &s;o by their own Experience.</P>
<P>NOW the&s;e things being thus briefly con&s;idered, I &s;hall ob&s;erve only two things from them.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is the extraordinary Prudence, as well as Piety, of our fir&s;t Reformers, who fir&s;t compi|led
<PB N="35" REF="003624_0040_100235BB6E4CF760">
the Book of <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> &s;o exactly confor|mable to the Word of God, and the Apo&s;tolical Canon in my Text; which I cannot but a&s;cribe to the &s;ame extraordinary aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from God, whereby they were afterward inabled to &s;uffer <HI>Per|&s;ecution,</HI> yea, <HI>Martyrdom</HI> it &s;elf for his &s;ake, and &s;o to confirm what they have done with their own <HI>Blood.</HI> Which certainly is no &s;mall Commendation of it.</P>
<P>The other thing I would ob&s;erve unto you, is the Rea&s;on why the Devil hath had &s;uch a Spight again&s;t the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> ever &s;ince it was fir&s;t made. For the more <HI>Edifying</HI> it is to God's People, the more De&s;tructive it mu&s;t needs be of the De|vil's Kingdom. And therefore it is no wonder that he hath all along imployed the utmo&s;t of his Pow|er and Policy to bla&s;t its Reputation, and &s;o to di&s;courage and di&s;&s;uade Men from the u&s;e of it. And by the Permi&s;&s;ion of God, for the Puni&s;h|ment of this ungrateful Nation, he hath &s;o far pre|vailed in his De&s;ign, that the <HI>Liturgy</HI> hath been <HI>twice</HI> ca&s;t out of the Church &s;ince it was fir&s;t brought into it, once in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and then again in the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> you all know, who were her In&s;truments in the doing of it, even the <HI>Papi&s;ts.</HI> For they clearly and truly fore&s;aw that their Erroneous Opinions could never be believed, nor Super&s;titious Practices ob&s;erved in the Nation, &s;o long as the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> was u&s;ed. Fora&s;much as there is nothing in it but what is &s;ound and agree|able to the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel, and &s;o contary to the groundle&s;s Opinions which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> would obtrude upon the World for <HI>Articles of Faith.</HI> And be&s;ides that, there are many Expre&s;&s;ions purpo&s;ely in&s;erted in it, to arm us again&s;t the <HI>Pope's
<PB N="36" REF="003624_0041_1002359BE338E050">
Supremacy, Indulgences, Invocation</HI> of <HI>Saints, Tran&s;ub|&s;tantion,</HI> and other <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Errors; &s;o that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion to be ever re&s;tored in the Nation, unle&s;s the <HI>Common-Pray|er</HI> was fir&s;t removed. Which therefore they took care to have done as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. But within a few Years after, even the Fir&s;t of Queen <HI>Eliza|beth,</HI> it was brought in again. And as the Refor|mation was begun before, &s;o from that time for|ward, it was carried on and perfected chiefly by the means of <HI>Common-Prayer.</HI> For it is very ob&s;er|vable, that in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and for &s;everal Years too of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> there was little or no Preaching in mo&s;t parts of the Kingdom, and few then could read <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and yet by the con&s;tant and general U&s;e of the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> and God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon it, the whole Nation was &s;o <HI>Edified</HI> in the True Religion, that there was &s;carce <HI>one</HI> in an <HI>hundred</HI> but for&s;ook and abhorred all <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Doctrines and Super&s;titions; which is an undeniable Argument, that in this re&s;pect al&s;o it is as <HI>Edifying,</HI> as it is po&s;&s;ible for a thing of that Na|ture to be. In&s;omuch that &s;o long as the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> is u&s;ed and frequented as it ought to be, it is morally impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>Popery</HI> to get any ground among&s;t us. But if this Bulwark was once removed (which God forbid) our grand Adver&s;ary would &s;oon accompli&s;h his malicious De&s;igns upon us, one way or other.</P>
<P>THIS he knows well enough, and therefore hath left no Stone unturned &s;o effect it. But what he hath done before by the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> he afterwards brought about again by other means in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t. For by what kind of Spirit the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> was then ca&s;t out you all know, and &s;ome of you found by <HI>woful Experience.</HI> All that I &s;hall &s;ay of it, is only this, that the &s;ame <HI>Spirit</HI> that then &s;tirred up People &s;o violently
<PB N="37" REF="003624_0042_100235BDC3768538">
again&s;t the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> &s;tirred them up at the &s;ame time to <HI>rebel</HI> again&s;t their <HI>King,</HI> to take away Mens <HI>E&s;tates</HI> and <HI>Lives</HI> contrary to all <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI>; and at la&s;t to <HI>murther</HI> one of the mo&s;t <HI>pious Princes</HI> that ever lived. And whether that was the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> or <HI>Antichri&s;t, God</HI> or the <HI>Devil,</HI> judge you. Be &s;ure the Con&s;equences of its being laid a&s;ide at that Time were very &s;ad. For Peo|ple being deprived of that whereby they &s;hould have been <HI>Edified,</HI> were immediately to&s;&s;ed to and fro with every <HI>Wind</HI> of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> until at length many of them fell into the mo&s;t <HI>pernicious</HI> and <HI>dam|nable Here&s;ies</HI> that were ever heard of in the <HI>Church.</HI> Yea, together with the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> they laid a&s;ide all Di&s;tinction betwixt &s;acred and common things; by which means the whole Nation was in Danger of be|ing over&s;pread with Prophanene&s;s and Irreligion.</P>
<P>But ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the mo&s;t high God for it, he was once more plea&s;ed to appear for us, and in a miraculous manner to re&s;tore our <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> to his Church, together with our Gracious Sovereign to his Kingdoms. But what &s;hall we render to the Lord for &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing as this is? All that he expects, or we can give him for it, is only to make the be&s;t u&s;e of it that we can. This therefore is that which I now pray and be|&s;eech you all for the future to do. Do not think it enough to be for the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> and to come now and then to hear it. This you may do, as many do, and yet receive no more Benefit by it, than as if there were none at all to be received. Which therefore can by no means be imputed to the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> it &s;elf, but to the Negligence of tho&s;e that u&s;e it. Neither mu&s;t you think it enough to talk high for it, or to rail at tho&s;e who are not &s;o happy as to be rightly informed about it. But rather take all Opportunities to inform them, and by all means po&s;&s;ible to convince them of the
<PB N="38" REF="003624_0043_1002359DC0032C80">
<HI>Excellency</HI> and <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of it. Which you can ne|ver do &s;o effectually, as by your out-&s;tripping and exceeding them in Virtue and good Works. For this is, and ever will be, a plain Demon&s;tration, that the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> is indeed far more <HI>Edifying</HI> than tho&s;e New Modes of Religion, which they are &s;o unhappily &s;educed into. That therefore you may do this, and &s;o both experience in your &s;elves, and demon&s;trate unto others, the Truth and Certainty of what you have now heard concerning the <HI>Com|mon Prayer,</HI> I de&s;ire you to ob&s;erve the&s;e few Rules in the u&s;ing of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> COME not to your publick Prayers only out of Cu&s;tom, or for Fa&s;hion-&s;ake, as the manner of &s;ome is, but out of a &s;incere Obedience to God's Commands, and with a &s;ure Tru&s;t and Confidence in his Promi&s;es for his Ble&s;&s;ing upon what you do. For which end it will be very good, as you go to <HI>Church,</HI> to bethink your &s;elves whither you are go|ing, and what you are to do there, that &s;o laying a&s;ide all other Bu&s;ine&s;s, you may put your &s;elves into a right Temper for &s;o great a Work.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> FREQUENT our publick Prayers as often as conveniently you can, The oftner you are at them, the better you will like them, and the more <HI>Edify'd</HI> you will be by them. And therefore do not &s;atisfy your&s;elves with hearing them once a Week. In this <HI>City,</HI> as al&s;o in many other places of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> e&s;pecially where there are <HI>Cathedrals,</HI> or <HI>Collegiate</HI> Churches, you may enjoy the Benefit of them publickly every Day, and &s;o keep your Hearts continually in an Holy and Heavenly Frame, and always live as becometh Chri&s;tians: And if you neglect &s;uch Opportunities as are now put in|to your Hands, you will one Day wi&s;h you had not; but then wi&s;hing will do no good.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="003624_0044_100235BF50251268"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> IF po&s;&s;ible, come always at the Beginning of Divine Service. Otherwi&s;e you will certainly mi&s;s of &s;omething that would have been <HI>Edifying</HI> to you, and perhaps of that, which at that time might have done you more good than all the re&s;t. Nei|ther will you lo&s;e the Benefit only of part of it, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure of the whole too; all the parts of it being linked together in &s;o excellent a man|ner and method, that they influence and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other. So that nothing can be omitted either by Mini&s;ter or People, but the whole will &s;uffer by it, and lo&s;e &s;omething of that Virtue and Efficacy, which otherwi&s;e you will find in it.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> ALL the while that you are in <HI>God's Hou&s;e,</HI> carry your&s;elf as in his &s;pecial Pre&s;ence, and &s;uitably to the work you are about: <HI>&s;tanding</HI> while you prai&s;e God, and <HI>kneeling</HI> when you pray unto him, as our Church hath directed you. For tho' the&s;e may &s;eem but little things in them&s;elves, yet they are of great Con&s;equence, both to our Wor|&s;hipping of God aright, and to our being <HI>Edified</HI> by what we do, as I have &s;hewed before.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> TAKE &s;pecial care all along to keep your Minds intent upon the matter in hand; when you confe&s;s your Sins to God, do it with an hearty and &s;incere Repentance for all the Errors of your Life pa&s;t. When the <HI>Ab&s;olution</HI> is pronounced, receive it with a firm and &s;tedfa&s;t Faith in Chri&s;t our Saviour. When yon Repeat or Sing the <HI>Hymns</HI> and <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> rai&s;e up your Spirits as high as you can, to join with tho&s;e above in prai&s;ing and magnifying the Eternal God. When the Word of God is Read, hearken diligently unto it, and con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly what he that made you, &s;aith to you, and requireth of you, and re&s;olve by his Ble&s;&s;ing to believe and live accord|ingly. And all the while that you are upon your
<PB N="40" REF="003624_0045_100235A069F5DDF8">
<HI>Knees,</HI> putting up your Petitions to the mo&s;t high God, let your whole Souls be imployed in it, ear|ne&s;tly de&s;iring the good things you pray for at his gracious Hands, and humbly confiding on his faith|ful Promi&s;es for the granting of them. By this means you will perform rea&s;onable Service unto God, and by con&s;equence that which will be very accep|table unto him, and as profitable and <HI>edifying</HI> to your &s;elves. Whereas they that do not ob&s;erve this Rule, cannot be properly &s;aid to pray, or &s;erve God at all. And therefore it is no wonder that they come to Church and hear the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> read, and yet are no way <HI>edified</HI> by it. Indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould. Fora&s;much as all the Benefit and <HI>Edification</HI> that we can po&s;&s;ibly receive from any of our Devo|tions, depends very much upon the due Intention of our Minds in the Performance of them. To which, as I have &s;hewn, both a Form of Prayer in general, and ours in particular, is a very great help.</P>
<P>DO but ob&s;erve the&s;e plain and nece&s;&s;ary Rules in u&s;ing of the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> (without which you can|not be truly &s;aid to u&s;e, but rather to abu&s;e it) and you will &s;oon find what I have &s;aid about it to be true, even that <HI>All things in it are done to Edifying.</HI> And therefore I would to God, that not only you that hear me at this time, but all the People of the Nation, could be once per&s;uaded to do &s;o. What an holy Nation, what a peculiar People &s;hould we then become? How <HI>Pious</HI> towards <HI>God</HI>? How <HI>Loyal</HI> to our <HI>Sovereign</HI>? How <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>Charitable</HI> to one another? For by our con&s;tant Wor&s;hipping Almighty God in &s;o &s;olemn and de|vout a manner as this is, our Hearts will be over|awed with &s;o great a Fear of his Divine Maje&s;ty, that we &s;hould never dare willingly to offend him. Our Minds would be filled and impregnated with &s;uch a Sen&s;e of his Power and Sovereignty, that we &s;hould honour and reverence it in tho&s;e al&s;o
<PB N="41" REF="003624_0046_100235C1485481E0" MS="y">
whom he hath &s;et over us. Our whole Souls would be rai&s;ed up &s;o much above the World, that we &s;hould not do an ill Act to gain it wholly to our &s;elves. In &s;hort, we &s;hould be every day <HI>Edified</HI> more and more in <HI>Faith,</HI> in <HI>Love,</HI> in <HI>Humility,</HI> in <HI>Self-denial,</HI> in <HI>Temperance,</HI> in <HI>Patience,</HI> in all true <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Vertue</HI>: And &s;o we &s;hould grow from Strength to Strength, from one degree of Grace un|to another, until at length we arrive at Glory and Perfection in the Highe&s;t Heavens, where we &s;hall &s;pend Eternity it &s;elf in Prai&s;ing and Adoring the mo&s;t high God; as for all the other Mercies which he hath vouch&s;afed to us, &s;o in a particular man|ner for our being Members of &s;uch an <HI>Apo&s;tolical Church,</HI> wherein <HI>all things are done to Edifying.</HI></P>
<P>WHICH <HI>God of his infinite Mercy grant we may all do, in and through our Lord and Saviour</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>to whom with the</HI> Father <HI>and</HI> Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>be all Honour and Glory, World without end.</HI> Amen.</P>
