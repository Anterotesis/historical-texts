<HEAD>PLAIN TRUTH; CONTAINING, REMARKS ON A LATE PAMPHLET ENTITLED COMMON SENSE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now before me the Pamphlet, entitled COMMON SENSE; on which I &s;hall remark with freedom and candour. It may not be improper to remind my rea|der, that the inve&s;tigation of my &s;ubject, demands the utmo&s;t freedom of enquiry, I therefore entreat his indulgence; and that he will carefully remember, that intempe|rate zeal, is as injurious to liberty, as a manly di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of facts is friendly to it. "Liberty, &s;ays the great MONTESQUIEU, is a right of doing whatever the laws permit; and if a citizen could do what they forbid, he would no longer be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of liberty, becau&s;e all his fellow citizens would have the &s;ame power." In the beginning of his pamphlet, the Author a&s;&s;erts, that &s;ociety in every &s;tate is a ble&s;&s;ing. This in the &s;in|cerity of my heart I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ny; for it is &s;upreme mi&s;ery to be a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e, who to promote their ambitious purpo&s;es, flagiti|ou&s;ly
<PB N="10" REF="043001_0006_101CC204F3F47DC8">
pervert the ends of political &s;ociety. I do not &s;ay that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Author is indebted to BURGH'S POLITICAL DISQUISITIONS, or to ROUSSEAU'S Social Compact for his de|finition of Government, and his large Tree; although I wi&s;h he had favoured his reader with the following extract from that &s;ub|lime rea&s;oner. "To inve&s;tigate tho&s;e con|ditions of &s;ociety which may be&s;t an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of nations, would require the abi|lities of &s;ome &s;uperior intelligence, who &s;hould be witne&s;s to all the pa&s;&s;ions of men, but be &s;ubject it&s;elf to none, who &s;hould have no connections with human nature, but &s;hould have a perfect knowledge of it: A Being, in &s;hort, who&s;e happine&s;s &s;hould be independent of us, and who would ne|verthele&s;s employ it&s;elf about us. It is the province of Gods to make laws for Men." With the utmo&s;t deference to the celebrated ROUSSEAU, I cannot indeed imagine, that laws even &s;o con&s;tructed, would materially benefit our imperfect race; unle&s;s omni&s;|cience deigned previou&s;ly to exalt our na|ture. The judicious reader will therefore perceive, that malevolence only, is requi|&s;ite to declaim again&s;t, and arraign the mo&s;t perfect Governments. Our <HI>Political Quack</HI> avails him&s;elf of this trite expedient, to ca|jole the people into the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery,
<PB N="11" REF="043001_0007_101CC207F2945D40">
under the delu&s;ive name of independence. His fir&s;t indecent attack is again&s;t the Engli&s;h con&s;titution; which with all its imperfec|tions, is, and ever will be the pride and envy of mankind. To this panegyric involunta|rily our author &s;ub&s;cribes, by granting indi|viduals to be &s;afer in England, than in any other part of Europe. He indeed in&s;idi|ou&s;ly attributes this pre-eminent excellency, to the con&s;titution of the people, rather than to our excellent con&s;titution. To &s;uch contemptible &s;ubterfuge is our Author reduced. I would a&s;k him, why did not the con&s;titution of the people afford them &s;uperior &s;afety, in the reign of Richard the Third, Henry the Eighth, and other ty|rannic princes? Many pages might indeed be filled with encomiums be&s;towed on our excellent con&s;titution, by illu&s;trious authors of different nations.</P>
<P>This beautiful &s;y&s;tem (according to MONTESQUIEU) our con&s;titution is a com|pound of Monarchy, Ari&s;tocracy, and De|mocracy. But it is often &s;aid, that the Sovereign, by honours and appointments, influences the Commons. The profound and elegant HUME agitating this que&s;tion, thinks, to this circum&s;tance, we are in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> indebted for our &s;upreme felicity; &s;ince without &s;uch controal in the Crown, our
<PB N="12" REF="043001_0008_101CC20AE9976278">
Con&s;titution would immediately degenerate into Democracy; a Government, which in the &s;equel, I hope to prove ineligible. Were I a&s;ked marks of the be&s;t government, and the purpo&s;e of political &s;ociety, I would re|ply, the encrea&s;e, pre&s;ervation, and pro&s;pe|rity of its members, in no quarter of the Globe, are tho&s;e marks &s;o certainly to be found, as in Great Britain, and her depend|encies. After our Author has employed &s;everal pages, to break the mounds of &s;ociety by deba&s;ing Monarchs: He &s;ays, "The plain truth is, that the antiquity of Engli&s;h Monarchy will not bear looking into."</P>
<P>HUME treating of the original contract, has the following melancholy, but &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervation, "Yet rea&s;on tells us, that there is no property in durable objects, &s;uch as lands, and hou&s;es, when carefully ex|amined, in pa&s;&s;ing from hand to hand, but mu&s;t in &s;ome period, have been f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fraud and inju&s;tice.

Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation. The reader no doubt will be gratified by the following extract from a mo&s;t primitive Chri&s;tian. "Chri&s;ti|anity is a &s;piritual religion, relative only to cele&s;tial objects. The Chri&s;tian's inheri|tance is not of this world. He performs his duty it is true, but this he does with a profound indifference for the good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of his endeavours: Provided he hath nothing to reproach him&s;elf, it is of little con&s;equence to him whether m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tters go well or ill here below. If the &s;tate be in a flouri&s;hing condition, he can hardly venture to rejoice in the public felicity, lea&s;t he &s;hould be puffed up, with the inordinate pride of his country's glory. If the &s;tate decline, he ble&s;&s;es the hand of GOD, that humbles his people to the du&s;t."</P>
<P>Having de&s;ined the be&s;t government, I will humbly attempt to de&s;cribe good Kings by the following unerring rule. The be&s;t Princes are con&s;tantly calumniated by the envenomed tongues and pens of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of their &s;ubjects. For this me|lancholy truth, do I appeal to the te&s;timony of impartial hi&s;torians, and long experience. The noble impartial hi&s;torian Sully, &s;peak|ing of the almo&s;t divine Henry the Fourth of France &s;ays, "Thus was this god-like prince repre&s;ented (by the di&s;contented of
<PB N="15" REF="043001_0011_101CC213196F1FA8">
the&s;e days) almo&s;t throughout his whole kingdom, as a furious, and implacable tyrant: They were never without one &s;et of arguments to engage his catholic nobility in a rebellion again&s;t him, and another to &s;ow &s;edition among his pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">te&s;tant officers and gentry." HUME &s;ays, that the cruel unrelenting tyrant, Philip the Second of Spain, with his infernal Inqui&s;ition, was not more dete&s;ted by the people of the Netherlands, than was the humane Char|les, with his inoffen&s;ive Liturgy, by his mutinous &s;ubjects. The many unmerited in&s;ults offered to our gracious Sovereign; by the unprincipled Wilkes, and others down to this late Author; will forever di&s;grace humanity. For he &s;ays, "that mo|narchy was the mo&s;t pro&s;perous invention the Devil ever &s;et on foot for the pro|motion of idolatry. It is the pride of Kings which throws mankind into confu&s;ion: In &s;hort, continues this Author, monarchy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, have laid not this or that king|dom only, but the world in blood and a&s;hes." How deplorably wretched the condition of mankind, could they believe &s;uch execrable flagitious jargon. Unhap|pily indeed, mankind in every age are &s;u&s;|ceptible of delu&s;ion; but &s;urely our Au|thor's poi&s;on carries its antidote with it.
<PB N="16" REF="043001_0012_101CC214A7551398">
Attentive to the &s;pirit of his publication, we fancy our&s;elves in the barbarous fif|teenth century; in which period our Au|thor would have figured with his "Common Sen&s;e&mdash;and blood will attend it."</P>
<P>After his terrible anathema again&s;t our venerable con&s;titution, and monarchy; let us briefly examine a democratical &s;tate; and &s;ee whether or not it is a government le&s;s &s;anguinary. This government is extremely plau&s;ible, and indeed flattering to the pride of mankind. The demagogues therefore, to &s;educe the people into their criminal de|&s;igns ever hold up democracy to them; although con&s;cious it never did, nor ever will an&s;wer in practice. If we believe a great Author, "There never exi&s;ted, nor ever will exi&s;t a real democracy in the World." If we examine the republics of Greece and Rome, we ever find them in a &s;tate of war dome&s;tic or foreign. Our Author therefore makes no mention of the&s;e ancient States. "When Alexander ordered all the exiles, to be re&s;tored throughout all the cities, it was found that the whole amounted to twenty thou&s;and, the remains probably of &s;till greater &s;laugh|ters and ma&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cres. What an a&s;toni&s;hing number in &s;o narrow a country as ancient Greece? and what dome&s;tic confu&s;ion,

jealou&s;y, partiality, revenge, heart-burn|ings mu&s;t tear tho&s;e cities, where factions were wrought up to &s;uch a degree of fury and de&s;pair." Apian's hi&s;tory of the civil wars of Rome, contains the mo&s;t fright|ful picture of ma&s;&s;acres, pro&s;criptions, and forfeitures that ever were pre&s;ented to the world.</P>
<P>The excellent Monte&s;quieu declares, "that a democracy &s;uppo&s;es the concur|rence of a number of circum&s;tances rarely united. In the fir&s;t place, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that the &s;tate it&s;elf &s;hould be of &s;mall extent; &s;o that the people might be ea&s;ily a&s;&s;embled and per&s;onally known to each other. Se|condly, the &s;implicity of their manners, &s;hould be &s;uch as to prevent a multiplicity of affairs, and perplexity in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing them: And thirdly, there &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t a great de|gree of equality between them, in point of right and authority: La&s;tly, there &s;hould be little or no luxury, for luxury mu&s;t either be the effect of wealth, or it mu&s;t make it nece&s;&s;ary. It corrupts at once, both rich and poor: The one, by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the other, by the want of it." To this may be added continues the &s;ame Author, "that no government is &s;o &s;ubject to CIVIL WARS, and INTESTINE COMMO|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">IONS, as that of the democratical or po|pular

form; becau&s;e, no other tends &s;o &s;trongly and &s;o con&s;tantly to alter, nor re|quires &s;o much vigilance, and fortitude to pre&s;erve it from alteration. It is indeed, in &s;uch a con&s;titution, particularly, that a Citizen &s;hould always be armed with for|titude, and con&s;tancy; and &s;hould every day, in the &s;incerity of his heart, guard a|gain&s;t corruption, ari&s;ing either from &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s in him&s;elf, or in his compatriots; for if it once enters into public tran&s;actions, to root it out afterwards would be miraculous.</P>
<P>Our Author a&s;&s;erts, that Holland and Swi&s;&s;erland are without wars dome&s;tic or foreign. About a century ago, Holland was in a few weeks over-run by the arms of France, and almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly &s;aved by the gallantry of her Prince of Orange, &s;o celebrated afterwards by the name of Wil|liam the Third. Almo&s;t from that period, until the treaty of Utrecht, Holland was a principal in wars, the mo&s;t expen&s;ive and bloody, ever waged by human kind. The wounds &s;he then received were unhealed in 1744, when reluctantly rou&s;ed from her pacific lethargy, &s;he was dragged into war; and lo&s;ing her impregnable Bergenopzoom, and Mae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">richt; was again on the brink of becoming a province to France, when happily liberated by the Briti&s;h Nation.
<PB N="19" REF="043001_0015_101CC21DCDFEDED8">
In the war of 1756. Holland continually in&s;ulted in the capture of her &s;hips, by our crui&s;ers; pre&s;erved a humiliating neutrali|ty. If victory indeed had not crowned the Briti&s;h banners; the Dutch indubitably would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted their natural Allies, in whatever quarter of the globe attacked: For it is inconte&s;tibly true; that the exi&s;tence of Holland, as a State, depends, and in|variably will depend, on the pro&s;perity of Great Britain. Since the murder of Barne|velt, and the immortal de Wits, by the de|luded furious people, Holland hath too often been convul&s;ed by anarchy, and torn by party. Unfortunately alas! for the cau&s;e of humanity; the rugged and incult de&s;arts of Swi&s;&s;erland, preclude not ambi|tion, &s;edition, and anarchy. Her bleak and barren mountains do not &s;o effectu|ally &s;ecure precarious liberty, as daily vend|ing her &s;ons to the adjoining nations, parti|cularly to France; by whom the thirteen Cantons, could be &s;ubjected in as many days, did that court meditate &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s and delu&s;ive an object. Nugatory indeed, if we con&s;ider, that France derives more &s;ub&s;tantial advantage from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Swi&s;&s;erland, than if &s;he exhau&s;ted her&s;elf, to maintain numerous Battalions, to bridle the Cantons. A moment, let us

&s;uppo&s;e, that our author's a&s;&s;everations of Holland and Swi&s;&s;erland, are as real as de|lu&s;ive: His inferences do not flow from his premi&s;es; for their &s;uperior advantages, do not ari&s;e from their popular government, but from circum&s;tances of peculiar local felicity, obliging the princes of Europe, to defend them from the omnipotent land force, if I may &s;o &s;peak of France. After impotently attacking our Sovereign; and the con&s;titution: He contradicts the voice of all mankind, by declaring, that America "would have flouri&s;hed as much, and pro|bably much more, had no European power taken any notice of her."</P>
<P>If he means, that had this Continent been unexplored, the original inhabitants would have been happier: For once, I agree with him. Previous to the &s;ettlement of the&s;e Provinces by our Ance&s;tors, the kingdom of France was convul&s;ed by religious phrenzy. This, and Seba&s;tian Cabot's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;covery, perhaps, happily afforded the people of England, an opportunity of locating the&s;e Provinces. At length, peace being re&s;tored to France, by her Hero, Henry the Fourth: His nation in turn, were &s;eized with the rage of colonizing. Finding the Engli&s;h claimed the Provinces on the Atlantic; they appropriated the

&s;now banks of Canada, which we dare not &s;uppo&s;e, they would have preferred to the&s;e fertile provinces, had not the prior occu|pancy, and power of England interfered. I hope it will not be denied, that the notice taken of us, at this time by an European Power, was rather favourable for us.&mdash;Certain it is, had not England then taken notice of us, the&s;e delectable Provinces would now appertain to France; and the people of New England, horrid to think, would now be counting their b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ads. Some years after the AEra in que&s;tion, the civil wars intervening in England, afforded to the Swedes and Dutch, a footing on this Con|tinent. Charles the Second being re&s;tored; England reviving her claim, rendered abor|tive the Swedi&s;h preten&s;ions; and by con|que&s;t, and granting Surinam to the Dutch, procured the ce&s;&s;ion of their u&s;urpation, now New York. I do indeed confe&s;s, my in|capacity to di&s;cern the injury &s;u&s;tained by this &s;econd "notice taken of us, by an European Power;" in default of which in|tervention, the Swedes, to this hour, would have retained their &s;ettlement, now the famed Penn&s;ylvania; and the Dutch, con|&s;equently, had retained theirs.

<P>Indeed it is worthy of note, that the in|habitants of Jamaica, Barbadoes, and Vir|ginia, at that very time, enacted laws, breathing the &s;pirit of humanity, and &s;uch as men could bear. Soon after the period in que&s;tion, arrived the great and good WILLIAM PENN, with his philo&s;ophic people called Quakers; together with to|leration, indu&s;try, and permanent credit. The people of England, encouraged by the exten&s;ion of their laws and commerce to tho&s;e colonies, powerfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted our merchants and planters, in&s;omuch, that our &s;ettlements encrea&s;ed rapidly, and throve apace. It may be affirmed, that from this period, until the pre&s;ent unhap|py hour; no part of human kind, ever experienced more perfect felicity.

<P>I reply, that our exporting grain, is as it were of ye&s;terday, that the recent de|mand was principally occa&s;ioned by the di&s;tractions in Poland, and other parts of Europe, and probably will totally or partly

I believe the Europeans did eat before our merchants exported our grain, and perhaps will eat, when they cea&s;e to export it. I deny, that this momentary commerce hath enriched us; and I could adduce numberle&s;s melancholy proofs of the contrary. I &s;hall only remark, that in the mo&s;t fertile and delectable wheat coun|try in America, bounded by Che&s;opeak-bay, and almo&s;t adjoining that of Delaware; a tract of the be&s;t wheat land ten years ago, would hardly have exceeded a guinea and a half per acre, indeed, in 1773, &s;uch land covered with wood, would &s;carcely have &s;old for four guineas an acre, an undoubted proof of want of PEOPLE, indu&s;try, and wealth; particular|ly &s;o, if we con&s;ider that one crop of corn and wheat on &s;uch land judiciou&s;ly cultivated, would actually repay the &s;up|po&s;ed price. Our author a&s;&s;erts, "that our pre&s;ent numbers are &s;ufficient to repel the force of all the world. That the Con|tinent hath at this time the large&s;t di&s;ci|plined army of ANY POWER UNDER HEAVEN. That the Engli&s;h navy is only worth three millions and a half &s;terling," which in effect, would reduce it to thirty-five

of the years 1759-60, and 61, was more a&s;toni&s;hing to Europe, than the victories of her fleets and armies. The annual rents of the kingdom of England only, many years ago, amounted to thirty three millions &s;ter|ling. Thirty five millions bu&s;hels of wheat are annually produced in that kingdom; and perhaps as many bu&s;hels of other grain: Twelve millions of fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eces of wool are there yearly &s;horn. In &s;hort, the Kingdom is a perfect Bee-hive, in numbers and indu&s;try; and is &s;aid to contain more indu&s;try, con&s;equently more wealth, than all the re&s;t of Europe. The famed HUME &s;ays, "I &s;hould as &s;oon dread, that all our rivers and &s;prings, &s;hould be exhau&s;ted, as that money &s;hould abandon a kingdom; where there are people and indu&s;try." The Briti&s;h navy, at the clo&s;e of la&s;t war, con&s;i&s;ted of nearly two hundred &s;hips of the line, one hundred large frigates, and about one hundred &s;maller frigates, or other armed ve&s;&s;els. Since the peace, I believe, the navy has been mo&s;t vigilantly pre&s;erved by Lord Sandwich, (&s;aid to be as equal to that arduous department, as any man in Europe.) Since the war, &s;everal capital &s;hips have an|nually been built; and it is mo&s;t certain, that on &s;ix months notice, Great Britain could equip fleets, &s;ufficiently formidable, to con|tend with all the naval force, that could,

The immen&s;e quantity of naval and other &s;tores, in the different ar&s;enals, with the royal navy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seventeen capital &s;hips were built from 1763 until 1771.</NOTE> can|not at this time be worth le&s;s than twenty millions &s;terling.

<P>Let us now examine our author's ac|count of the navy of Great-Britain. "It is &s;ays he, worth no more than three mil|lions and an half &s;terling." This in effect will reduce it to ten &s;econd rate &s;hips of war, ten third rate, fifteen fourth rate, ten &s;hips of forty guns, ten of thirty &s;ix, and eight of twenty. "If America &s;ays he, had only a twentieth part of the naval force of Britain, &s;he would be by far an over-match for her, becau&s;e as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our whole force would be employed on our own coa&s;t; where we &s;hould in the long run have two to one the advantage of tho&s;e who had three or four thou&s;and miles to &s;ail over,

And although Britain by her fleet, hath a check over our trade to Europe, we have as large a one over her trade to the We&s;t Indies, which, by laying in the neigh|bourhood of the Continent, lies entirely at its mercy."</P>
<P>Were it lawful to joke on &s;o &s;erious an occa&s;ion, I would remind the reader of our Author's mode&s;ty, in &s;aying, "that we claim no foreign dominion:" Since we have the mo&s;t numerous, and be&s;t di&s;ciplin|ed army under Heaven; and a navy &s;uffi|ciently &s;trong to combat that of Great Bri|tain. For our pre&s;ent naval armament com|po&s;e a fleet more than equal to a twentieth part of the Briti&s;h navy, (according to our author's e&s;timation.) Notwith&s;tand|ing our author's delicacy, relying on the well known utility of mela&s;&s;es, to the New England governments: I hope they will order Admiral Manly to &s;ei&s;e Jamaica, and the other We&s;t India I&s;lands. The Admiral cannot be at a lo&s;s for men; &s;ince, according to our author, "a few &s;ocial &s;ailors, will &s;oon in&s;truct a &s;ufficient num|ber of active landmen, in the common work of a &s;hip.

<P>We mu&s;t indeed allow, that Spain, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Mexico and Peru, cannot maintain the mo&s;t numerous and be&s;t di&s;ci|plined army under Heaven, nor equip a navy fit to contend with the fleets of Bri|tain. It mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;&s;ed, that he makes Great Britain, very favourably di&s;|po&s;e of her humbled navy, by employing nineteen parts of it in the Mediterranean, A&s;ia, Africa, and I know not where: When he knows we have &s;o great a check on her We&s;t India trade, a commerce, of the la&s;t importance to her.</P>

It is indeed humiliating to con&s;i|der, that this author &s;hould vamp up a form of government, &s;or a con&s;iderable part of mankind; and in ca&s;e of its &s;ucceeding, that he probably would be one of our ty|rants, until we prayed &s;ome more illu&s;tri|ous tyrant of the army, to &s;purn him to his primeval ob&s;curity; from all his ill-got honours flung, turned to that dirt from whence he &s;prung.

<P>I am perfectly &s;atisfied, that we are in no condition to &s;et the world at defiance, that commerce and the protection of Great Bri|tain will &s;ecure us peace, and the friend&s;hip of all Europe; but I deny that it is the intere&s;t of all Europe to have America a free-port, unle&s;s they are de&s;irous of depopulating their dominions.

<P>Antiquity affords us no eclarci&s;ement re|&s;pecting the future government of Ame|rica.

is not temerity to add, that the weight of Britain, in the &s;cale of tho&s;e provinces, would preponderate again&s;t the power of New England. If Britain &s;hould reduce the Colonies by arms, (which may Heaven avert!) The New England provinces will have as little inclination, as ability, to di&s;|turb the peace of their neighbours. I do indeed mo&s;t &s;incerely compa&s;&s;ionate tho&s;e unhappy men, who are ruined by our un|fortunate di&s;tractions. I do fervently pray, that Britain, and the Colonies may mo&s;t effectually con&s;ider their peculiar infelicity. Such attention will do infinite honour to the parent &s;tate; who cannot view them as enemies, but as men unhappily irritated by the impolitic mea&s;ures of Great Bri|tain. "The diminution of trade affords an army, and the nece&s;&s;ities of an army, create a new trade."

Our Author's excellent axiom, "that the diminution, &amp;c."

<P>"If premiums (&s;ays our Author) were to be given to Merchants to build and employ in their &s;ervice, &s;hips mounted with 20, 30, 40, or 50 guns, the premiums to be in proportion to the lo&s;s of bulk to the Mer|chants. Fifty or &s;ixty of tho&s;e &s;hips, with a few guard &s;hips on con&s;tant duty, would keep up a &s;ufficient navy, and that without burdening our&s;elves with the evil &s;o loudly complained of in England&punc; of &s;uffering their fleets in time of peace to lie rotting in their docks." Yield the palm of ingenuity to our Author, ye De Wits, Colberts, Pelhams, and Pitts. He has outdone ye by con&s;tructing a beautiful navy; alas! on paper only.&mdash;Fir&s;t, no nation in Europe depends on &s;uch &s;hips for her defence: Secondly, &s;uch &s;hips would be unfit to contend with capital &s;hips: Thirdly, in the hour of danger, the&s;e &s;hips on their voyage, or return, would alternately be taken by an active enemy: La&s;tly, &s;ix times as many &s;uch &s;hips would be une|qually matched with that part of the naval power of Britain, which &s;he actually could &s;pare to combat on our coa&s;ts&punc; This cannot be thought exaggeration, if we con&s;ider
<PB N="47" REF="043001_0043_101CC267D10456A8">
that the Briti&s;h navy, la&s;t war, carried about &s;eventeen thou&s;and guns; and up|wards of ninety-five thou&s;and &s;ocial &s;eamen. "No country (&s;ays our author) is &s;o hap|pily &s;ituated, or internally capable of rai&s;ing a fleet as America. Tar, timber, iron and cordage are her natural produce." He &s;peaks of forming a fleet, as if he could do it by his Fiat. A third rate &s;hip of the line fitted for &s;ea, is allowed to co&s;t &s;eventy four thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which at the pre&s;ent exchange, is about one hundred and twenty nine thou&s;and pounds. Now, as labour, &s;ail cloth, cordage, and other re|qui&s;ites, are dearer than in Europe, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e the advanced price, at twenty-five per cent. which makes the amount one hundred and fifty four thou&s;and pounds. We mu&s;t next &s;uppo&s;e our navy equal to that of France, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixty four &s;hips of the line (fifty gun &s;hips inclu&s;ive) twenty-five frigates, with &s;hips of inferior force. In ca&s;e of independence, we cannot admit a &s;maller naval force. In|deed, when joined to the fleets of France and Spain, the navies &s;o united, and navi|gated principally with land&s;men, in&s;tructed by a few &s;ocial &s;ailors, will be va&s;tly infe|rior to the &s;quadrons of Britain. The amount therefore of &s;uch our navy, will
<PB N="48" REF="043001_0044_101CC26A6E24A710">
only require the trifling &s;um of twelve mil|lion, &s;ix hundred and twenty five thou&s;and pounds currency, which I am very willing to believe we can &s;pare, being &s;carcely one fourth the value of our property, real and per&s;onal. With excellent management, our navy would laft eight, nine, or ten years; we therefore would find it extremely conve|nient to rebuild it con&s;tantly at the expira|tion of that term: Of this there cannot be a doubt, when we remember with our Au|thor, "that &s;hip-building is America's greate&s;t pride. The va&s;t empire of Ru&s;|&s;ia is almo&s;t &s;hut out from the &s;ea, where|fore her boundle&s;s forre&s;ts, her tar, iron, and cordage, are only articles of commerce." I reply, that Ru&s;&s;ia containing ten times our numbers, is de&s;titute of indu&s;try and com|merce. She has ports &s;ufficient to build and contain a navy to &s;ubdue the world. De&s;titute as we have remarked of indu&s;try and commerce, her navy is incon&s;iderable, and being equipt with land&s;men, cannot figure again&s;t &s;hips navigated by &s;ocial &s;ailors. Who can doubt the ability of Spain to build a navy? The cargo of two or three of her annual galeons were &s;ufficient to build a navy as formidable as that permitted to Great Britain (by the author of Common Sen&s;e.) In her I&s;land of Cuba, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="49" REF="043001_0045_101CC26F82E2B948">
an immen&s;ity of fine cedar; &s;he might con|&s;truct a navy as formidable as that of Great Britain, but to what purpo&s;e, other than to adorn the triumph of her enemies; un|le&s;s &s;he could arm her &s;hips, otherwi&s;e than by active land&s;men, in&s;tructed by a few &s;ocial &s;ailors. Our Author &s;ays, "that the Terrible, Capt. Death, &s;tood the hotte&s;t en|gagement of any &s;hip la&s;t war, yet had not twenty &s;ailors on board," (tho' her compli|ment of men was upwards of two hundred.)</P>
<P>We do indeed confe&s;s our&s;elves doubtful on this head, and therefore wi&s;h our Author had produced his authority. We do appre|hend, that naval actions, very generally de|pend on &s;eaman-&s;hip, that is, on dextrou&s;ly working the &s;hip during the combat. Now the judicious reader will remember, that &s;hips of war in engagement cannot be navigated by a few &s;ocial &s;ailors, nor even by a bare com|petency, unle&s;s &s;uch &s;ailors are more invul|nerable than was the great Achilles.</P>
<P>"Were the Continent (&s;ays our Author) crowded with inhabitants, her &s;ufferings under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, would be intolerable, the more &s;ea ports we had, the more we &s;hould have both to defend, and to lo&s;e." This is rather incomprehen|&s;ible; I cannot imagine, that we would be le&s;s formidable with ten times our pre|&s;ent
<PB N="50" REF="043001_0046_101CC2721DA36318">
numbers, if at pre&s;ent we can defend one &s;ea-port; &s;urely, with ten times as many inhabitants, we could equally defend ten. If with our pre&s;ent numbers, we are a match for the world, con&s;equently with ten times as many, we would be a match for ten worlds, which would indeed be prodigious! The infant &s;tate of the Co|lonies as it is called, &s;o far from being a|gain&s;t, is an argument in favor of In|dependence." This a&s;&s;ertion is as ab&s;urd, as if he had maintained, that twenty is in|ferior in number to two. "But the in|juries and di&s;advantages we &s;u&s;tain by that connection, are without number, and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to our&s;elves, in&s;truct us to renounce the al|liance; becau&s;e any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, or de|pendence upon Great Britain, tends di|rectly to involve this Continent in Eu|ropean wars and quarrels. As Europe is our market for trade, we ought to form no poli|tical connection with any part of it." Innu|merable are the advantages of our connection with Britain; and a ju&s;t dependence on her, is a &s;ure way to avoid the horrors and calamities of war. Wars in Europe, will probably than heretofore become le&s;s frequent; religious rancour, which for|merly animated princes to arms, is &s;uc|ceded

by a &s;pirit of philo&s;ophy extreme|ly friendly to peace. The princes of Eu|rope are or ought to be convinced by &s;ad experience, that the objects of conque&s;t, are va&s;tly inadequate to the immen&s;e charge of their armaments. Prudential motives, therefore, in future, will often dictate ne|gociation, in&s;tead of war. Be it however admitted, that our &s;peculations are nuga|tory, and that as u&s;ual, we are involved in war. In this ca&s;e we really do not par|ticipate a twentieth part of the mi&s;ery and hard&s;hips of war, experienced by the other &s;ubjects of the empire. As future wars will probably be carried on by Britain in her proper element, her &s;ucce&s;s will hardly be doubtful, nor can this be thought audacity, if we remember the great things effected by Britain in her naval wars, then &s;econdary objects to her Germanic con|nections, to which &s;he now politically &s;eems indifferent. Our &s;ailors navigating our ve&s;&s;els to the We&s;t Indies during war, are exempted from impre&s;&s;ment, and if our trade to any part of Europe is then &s;tag|nated, it flows with uncommon rapidity in the We&s;t Indies, nor is the object of cap|tures incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Our author &s;urely forgets, that when in|dependent, we cannot trade with Europe,
<PB N="52" REF="043001_0048_101CC2757569EB70">
without political connections, and that all treaties made by England or other com|mercial &s;tates are, or ought to be, ulti|mately &s;ub&s;ervient to their commerce. "But (&s;ays our author,) admitting that matters were now made up, what would be the event? I an&s;wer the ruin of the Conti|nent, and that for &s;everal rea&s;ons." Recon|ciliation would conduct us to our former hap|py &s;tate. The happine&s;s of the governed is without doubt the true intere&s;t of the gover|nors, and if we aim not at independence, there cannot be a doubt, of receiving every advantage relative to laws and commerce that we can de&s;ire. Monte&s;quieu &s;peaking of the people of England, &s;ays, "They know better than any people on earth, how to value at the &s;ame time the&s;e three great ad|vantages, religion, liberty, and commerce." "It is a matter worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the more a country is peopled, the &s;maller their armies are." This indeed would be worthy of ob&s;ervation, did not daily experience contravert it. The armies of Ru&s;&s;ia, France, Au&s;tria, England, and Pru&s;&s;ia, are certainly more numerous than' tho&s;e of Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, and Sardinia. Now, the fir&s;t five &s;tates contain nearly &s;ixty millions, and the la&s;t kingdoms do not contain fourteen millions

of people. "In military numbers, the an|cients far exceeded the moderns, and the rea&s;on is evident, for trade being the con&s;e|quences of population, men become too much ab&s;orbed thereby, to attend to any thing el&s;e, commerce dimini&s;hes the &s;pirit both of patrioti&s;m, and military defence."</P>
<P>Every man of &s;en&s;e, now rejects the fabulous numbers of the army of X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rxes, and other fabled armies of antiquity. The ancient armies, did not exceed in numbers the armies of the moderns. If &s;o, their &s;tates had been de&s;olated by the horrid carnage of their battles, ari&s;ing from the military &s;pirit of defence, from the nature of their arms, and the arrangement of their armies, which permitted the combatants to buckle together, who &s;eldom gave quarter. The Roman armies never exceeded twenty-five legions, which including auxiliaries, did not exceed two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and, a number greatly inferior to the armies of France, or perhaps Britain during war. Notwith&s;tanding my ardour for li|berty, I do mo&s;t fervently pray, that we may never exchange the &s;pirit of com|merce, for that of military defence, even at the price of augmenting our armies. Let us hear the te&s;timony of Monte&s;quieu in favor of commerce: "Commerce, &s;ays

he, is a cure for the mo&s;t de&s;tructive pre|judices, for it is almo&s;t a general rule, that wherever we find agreeable manners, their commerce flouri&s;hes. Let us not be a&s;toni&s;hed then, if our manners are now le&s;s &s;avage than formerly. Commerce has every where diffu&s;ed a knowledge of all nations, the&s;e are compared one with another, and from this compari&s;on ari&s;e the greate&s;t advantages. Peace is the na|tural effect of trade, &amp;c." The Athenian people, perhaps the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of an|tiquity, did not long po&s;&s;es a commer|cial &s;pirit, but were almo&s;t continually af|flicted by this &s;pirit of military defence. The common people in effect di&s;tributed the public revenues among&s;t them&s;elves, while the rich, were in a &s;tate of oppre&s;|&s;ion. According to Ly&s;ius the orator and others, it was their cu&s;tom, when in want of money, to put to death &s;ome of the rich citizens, as well as &s;trangers, for the &s;ake of the forfeiture. In &s;hort, could we enumerate the infinite train of misfortunes inflicted on mankind, in every clime and age by this &s;elf-&s;ame &s;pirit of military de|fence; our readers will &s;urely join us in opinion, that commerce has mo&s;t hap|pily humanized mankind.

again&s;t commerce, the&s;e I have ever re|garded as trials of wit, rather than &s;erious productions. Our author's antipathy, and extreme aver&s;ion to commerce, is ea&s;ily accounted for. If his independence takes place, I do aver, that commerce will be as u&s;ele&s;s, as our &s;earching for the philo&s;o|pher's &s;tone. "And hi&s;tory (&s;ays he,) &s;uf|ficiently informs us, that the brave&s;t at|chievements were always accompli&s;hed in the non-age of a nation." The Greeks in their early &s;tate were pirates, and the Ro|mans robbers, and both warred in character. Their glorious actions were performed, (If I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf) in the man|hood of their empire. Carthage, Greece, A&s;ia, Spain, Gaul, and Britain, were not indeed conquered during the non-age of the republic. Agincourt, Cre&s;&s;ey, Oude|nard Ramillies, Blenheim, Dettingen, and Minden, &s;urely were not fought in the infancy of the Engli&s;h Empire. "With the encrea&s;e of commerce, England has lo&s;t her &s;pirit." This is really a curious di&s;co|very; who is unacquainted, that the Engli&s;h are the lords and factors of the univer&s;e, and the Britain joins to the commerce of Tyre, Carthage and Venice, the di&s;cipline of Greece, and the fire of old Rome. "The city of London, &s;ubmits to conti|nued

It therefore is her intere&s;t to grant us every &s;pecies of indulgence, con&s;i&s;tent with our con&s;titu|tional dependence, &s;hould war continue, there can be no doubt of the annihilation of our &s;hips, ports and commerce, by Great Britain. The King's &s;hips now in New England, unhappily are more than &s;ufficient to ruin the ports and commerce of the&s;e provinces. New York is already &s;ecured; and I &s;hould be extremely grieved to hear, that a &s;mall armament, were de&s;tined a|gain&s;t Philadelphia. In the opinion of the be&s;t officers of the navy; Philadelphia is acce&s;&s;ible to a few forty and fifty gun &s;hips, in de&s;pite of our temporary expedients to fortify the river Delaware.

I would remind our author of the con&s;tant language, and apparent purport of all ranks in oppo&s;ition to Great Britain: "We have (&s;ay they) been the happie&s;t people on earth, and would continue to be &s;o &s;hould Great Britain renounce her claim of taxation.

<P>I &s;hall no longer detain my reader, but conclude with a few remarks on our Author's &s;cheme.

<P>THE town has been lately amu&s;ed with a new political pamphlet, entitled COMMON SENSE.</P>
<P>This piece, though it has taken a popu|lar name, and implies that the contents are obvious, and adapted to the under&s;tandings of the bulk of the people is &s;o far from meriting the title it has a&s;&s;umed, that in my opinion it holds principles equally incon|&s;i&s;tent with learned and common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>I know not the author, nor am I anxious to learn his name or character; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or the book, and not the writer of it, is to be the &s;ubject of my animadver&s;ions.</P>
<P>'Tis the glory of a free country to enjoy
<PB N="76" REF="043001_0072_101CC2BA35797FB8">
a free pre&s;s, and of this, that the &s;enti|ments and opinions of the meane&s;t, equally with tho&s;e of the greate&s;t, are brought to view; for we know by frequent in&s;tances, that the rich and high born are not the monopolizers of wi&s;dom and virtue.&mdash;On the contrary, the&s;e qualities are oftener to be found among the middling cla&s;s in every country, who, being le&s;s di&s;&s;ipated and de|bauched than tho&s;e who are u&s;ually called their betters, apply them&s;elves with more indu&s;try to the culture of their under&s;tand|ings, and in reality become better acquain|ted with the true intere&s;ts of the &s;ociety in which they live.</P>
<P>But to my great grief I have too often &s;een in&s;tances of per&s;ons in every cla&s;s of life, who&s;e publications, at the &s;ame time they have reflected honor on the parts and genius of the authors, have been &s;o &s;hamefully wanting in candor as to attempt, by the cadence of words, and force of &s;tile, a to|tal perver&s;ion of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The pamphlet in que&s;tion &s;eems to be plainly calculated to induce a belief of three things.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the Engli&s;h form of government has no wi&s;dom in it, and that it is by no means &s;o con&s;tructed as to produce the
<PB N="77" REF="043001_0073_101CC2BBC5410C08">
happine&s;s of the people, which is the end of all good government.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That monarchy is a form of govern|ment incon&s;i&s;tent with the will of God.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That now is the time to break of all connection with Great Britain, and to de|clare an independence of the Colonies.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be obvious to every impartial eye, that the author rea&s;ons from the abu&s;es of, again&s;t the benefits derived from, the En|gli&s;h con&s;titution; and after reciting the&s;e abu&s;es concludes, very unfairly, that, "it is incapable to produce what is &s;eems to promi&s;e."&mdash;For if an argument of this &s;ort is to be received, it will prove perhaps ra|ther more than the author would choo&s;e&mdash;it would even prove that the Jewi&s;h theo|cracy was quite as improper, and as inca|pable to produce what it aimed at, as the reprobated Engli&s;h government. The re|cords of &s;acred hi&s;tory inform us, that the law was given to the people from God, and that the great Jehovah him&s;elf conde|&s;cended to call them his cho&s;en people. He &s;ignally interpo&s;ed in their behalf in bring|ing them out of bondage, in pre&s;erving them from the rage of Pharoah's army, and &s;eating them in a land flowing with milk and honey, under his immediate govern|ment

and laws, "written with his own finger."</P>
<P>"And he will love thee and ble&s;s thee, and multiply thee: he will al&s;o ble&s;s the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land, thy corn and thy wine, and thy oil; the increa&s;e of thy kine, and the flocks of thy &s;heep, in the land which he &s;ware unto thy fathers to give thee." Deut. vii. 13.</P>
<P>"Thou &s;halt be ble&s;&s;ed above all people, there &s;hall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle." Deut. vii. 14.</P>
<P>But what effects did all the&s;e extraordi|nary favors and promi&s;es of the Deity him|&s;elf produce upon that wicked, perver&s;e, &s;tiff necked people? Mo&s;es tells them,</P>
<P>"From the day that thou did&s;t depart out of the land of Egypt until ye came un|to this place, ye have been rebellious again&s;t the Lord." Deut. ix. 7.</P>
<P>"You have been rebellious again&s;t the Lord from the day that I knew you. Deut. ix. 24.</P>
<P>Profane as well as &s;acred hi&s;tory informs us of the ineffectuality of the be&s;t govern|ments and the wi&s;e&s;t laws among a corrupt, degenerate people. It does not regularly

follow, that if the people are not happy under an excellent form of civil polity, that the fault is in the government, it may be owing to the corruption of the people, and this I take to be the ca&s;e in Great Britain at this day. When the Briti&s;h parliament is properly balanced, and each branch of the legi&s;lature faithfully executes its duty, I think I am &s;afe in affirming there was never yet a form of government in the world &s;o well calculated for the happine&s;s of a free people as this, and yet we are told by the author of the pamphlet, that the "preju|dice of Engli&s;hmen in favor of King, Lords and Commons, ari&s;es as much or more from national pride than rea&s;on." The world has already &s;een numberle&s;s in&s;tances of fine &s;pun political theories, which, like the quackeries of mountebank doctors, are to cure all the political evils to which hu|man nature is liable.&mdash;But when the expe|riment is made, they become a&s;toni&s;hed at the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their boa&s;ted &s;chemes&mdash;they find a thou&s;and little pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts continually interfering with their de&s;igns, and at length retire again to their clo&s;ets, chagrined they had not thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy the great volume of human nature, before they ventured to &s;ay what was the be&s;t for mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="043001_0076_101CC2C464640A40">
The author, after venting his &s;pleen a|gain&s;t the Engli&s;h form of government, comes next to con&s;ider the &s;ubject of mo|narchy and heriditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; in treat|ing which he plainly di&s;covers the utmo&s;t prepo&s;&s;ion in favor of a republic. I &s;hall not follow him through his &s;cripture quo|tations, which he has &s;o carefully garbled to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, but beg leave to op|po&s;e &s;ome authorities to it.</P>
<P>The celebrated Trenchard, in No. 60, of Cato's Letters, &s;ays, "There is no go|vernment now upon earth, which owes its formation or beginning to the immediate revelation of God, or can derive its exi&s;t|ence from &s;uch revelation: It is certain, on the contrary, that the ri&s;e and in&s;titution, or variation of government, from time to time, is within the memory of men or of hi&s;tories; and that every government which we know at this day in the world, was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the wi&s;dom and force of mere men, and by the concurrence of cau&s;es evidently human."</P>
<P>"Nor has God by any revelation nomi|nated magi&s;trates, &s;hewed the nature or ex|tent of their powers, or given a plan of ci|vil polity for mankind." (Hutche&s;on's Moral Philo&s;ophy. p. 272.)</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="043001_0077_101CC2C855DB7968">
<HI>"There being no natural or divine law for any form of government,</HI> or that one per&s;on rather than another &s;hould have the &s;overeign admini&s;tration of affairs, or have power over many thou&s;and different families who are by nature all equal, being of the &s;ame rank, promi&s;cuou&s;ly born to the &s;ame advantages of nature, and to the u&s;e of the &s;ame com|mon faculties, therefore <HI>mankind is at liberty to choo&s;e what form of government they like."</HI></P>
<P>"God's providence or permi&s;&s;ion &s;uffered his own peculiar people the Jews to be un|der divers governments at divers times; as fir&s;t under patriarchs. Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, &amp;c. then under judges, Othniel, Ehud and Gideon; then under high-prie&s;ts, Eli and Samuel; then under kings, Saul, David and the re&s;t; then under captains and high prie&s;ts again, "as Zerobabel, Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren; and the government was la&s;tly taken from them, and they brought under the power of Rome. And that God permits &s;uch ma|gi&s;trate or magi&s;trates as the community thinks fit to approve, is plain by the te&s;ti|mony of Holy Scriptures; when God &s;aid to Solomon, "By me kings rule, even all the judges of the earth." Prov. viii. 16.</P>
<P>"When the &s;ons of Samuel were judges over I&s;rael, they took bribes and perverted

judgment, therefore the elders of I&s;rael de|&s;ired Samuel to make them a king; and though the elders are only mentioned to have a&s;ked a king of Samuel, they &s;eem to have been deputed from the whole con|gregation; for God &s;aid unto Samuel, <HI>"Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they &s;ay unto thee."</HI> 1 Sam. viii. 4, 7.</P>
<P><HI>"And Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord.</HI> 1 Sam. x. 25. 'Tis plain the manner of the kingdom &s;ignifies the con&s;titution of the government, by which was meant the conditions on which Saul was to be king, and they his &s;ubjects; for though <HI>God had given him the crown,</HI> it was to rule the people according to ju&s;tice and laws."</P>
<P>"After the battle between Saul and the Ammonites, Samuel &s;aid to the people, <HI>Come, let us go to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the Lord.</HI> 1 Sam. xi, 1, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15. <HI>Now therefore behold the king, whom ye have cho&s;en, and behold the Lord hath &s;et a king over you."</HI> Sam. chap. 12. 13.</P>
<P>The&s;e latter quotations are taken from the great Lord Sommers's book called the "Judg|ment of whole Kingdoms and Nations con|cerning the Rights of Kings and the People." This nobleman was Lord high chancellor of England in King William's reign, and
<PB N="83" REF="043001_0079_101CC2CCD708A6F8">
was remarkable for his revolution-prin|ciples, great learning and un&s;haken inte|grity, in public and private life.</P>
<P>It does therefore from the foregoing te&s;|timonies appear, that monarchy (&s;pecially a limited one, &s;uch as that of England) is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Holy Scriptures, as is &s;et forth in &s;aid pamphlet, but that it is as plea&s;ing to the Almighty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> agreeable to the people, as any other form of govern|ment, even the author's beloved republic.</P>
<P>The writer next proceeds to inform his readers of the numerous wars and &s;cenes of blood acted in England under their kings, and a&s;&s;erts that <HI>"Monarchy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion have laid the world in blood and a&s;hes. 'Tis a form of government which the word of God bears te&s;timony again&s;t, and blood will attend it."</HI> Here are bold a&s;&s;ertions indeed. To the latter part I have already endeavoured to make &s;ome reply, &s;o far as he a&s;&s;erts it is contrary to the word of God; but will the author's candor permit him to inform his reader of the infinite di&s;tractions and mi&s;|chiefs which have happened in the ancient and modern republics&mdash;Under this form there are always two parties, which divide the whole body of the people, and an eter|nal warfare &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them for power.

enough, no &s;word &s;ufficiently &s;harp, to puni&s;h tho&s;e whom they have &s;ubdued.&mdash;It then becomes a many headed mon&s;ter, a tyranny of many.</P>
<P>Let any man read with an unprejudiced eye the accounts which hi&s;torians give us of the famous Grecian Commonwealths, and I will venture to &s;peak for him, that he will not be&s;tow great commendations on them.&mdash;The Athenians, a wi&s;e and po|li&s;hed people, very often bani&s;hed their be&s;t citizens, from an apprehen&s;ion of their power&mdash;a glorious reward for a virtuous citi|zen, who, as was the ca&s;e in more in&s;tances than one, had pre&s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> country from de&s;truction. In the latter times of the Cartha|ginian and Roman republics, what con&s;tant &s;cenes of blood and deva&s;tation does hi&s;tory pre&s;ent to us&mdash;The multitude in a perpetual ferment like the ocean in a &s;torm&mdash;In a &s;torm did I &s;ay,&mdash;like the waters of the &s;ea, agitated by a dreadful whirlwind, no|thing but the fury of one party encounter|ing the rage of another.&mdash;Every trace of hu|manity being thus lo&s;t, men change their natures and become as fierce and &s;avage as wolves and tygers.</P>
<P>But let us de&s;cend nearer to modern times&mdash;let us look for happine&s;s and &s;ecuri|ty in the republic of Holland, &s;o often men|tioned, and &s;o little known&mdash;let us recol|lect

Liberty did not continue long in that coun|try, notwith&s;tanding the blood and trea&s;ure that were expended to acquire it.

Whenever one of them dies, the vacancy is filled up without any inter|ference of the people, and this important change was made in the &s;tate, becau&s;e of the intolerable feuds and animo&s;ities which attended the elections of repre&s;entatives.

<P>I cannot agree with the author of the pamphlet in opinion, that this is the time to declare an independence of the Colonies. This ought to be the dernier re&s;ort of America. Let us not yet lo&s;e &s;ight of the primary object of the di&s;pute, namely, a &s;afe, honorable, and la&s;ting reconciliation with Great Britain, until we are under a nece&s;&s;ity of doing it.

other and le&s;s &s;u&s;picious ways of carrying it into execution, than by Commi&s;&s;ioners, in the face of America, where they will have the eyes of all fixed upon them, and their conduct diligently watched and &s;e|verely &s;crutinized.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it appears that this writer is more an enemy to the bu&s;ine&s;s on which the Commi&s;&s;ioners are to be &s;ent than really apprehen&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or our virtue. He &s;eems to have drank deep of the <HI>cup of inde|pendency;</HI> to be inimical to whatever carries the appearance of <HI>peace;</HI> and too ready to &s;acrifice the happine&s;s of a great Continent to his favourite plan. Among &s;uch writers I pretend not to cla&s;s my&s;elf; for I am bold to declare, and hope yet to make it evident to every hone&s;t man, that the true intere&s;t of America lies in <HI>reconciliation</HI> with Great-Britain, upon <HI>con&s;titutional principles,</HI> and I can truly &s;ay, I wi&s;h it upon no other terms.</P>
<P>Why the many publications in favor of <HI>independency,</HI> with which our pre&s;&s;es have lately groaned, have pa&s;&s;ed hitherto unno|ticed, I am not able to determine. But there are certainly times when public affairs become &s;o intere&s;ting, that every man be|comes a debtor to the community for his opinions, either in &s;peaking or writing. Perhaps it was thought be&s;t, where an <HI>ap|peal</HI> was pretended to be made to the COM|MON

SENSE of this country, to leave the people for a while to the free exerci&s;e of that good under&s;tanding which they are known to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Tho&s;e who made the <HI>appeal</HI> have little cau&s;e to triumph in its &s;ucce&s;s. Of this they &s;eem &s;en&s;ible; and, like true quacks are con&s;tantly pe&s;tering us with their additional do&s;es, till the &s;tomachs of their patients begin wholly to revolt. If little notice has yet been taken of the pub|lications concerning, independence, it is neither owing to the popularity of the doc|trine, the unan&s;werable nature of the argu|ments, nor the fear of oppo&s;ing them, as the vanity of the authors would &s;ugge&s;t. I am confident, that nine-tenths of the people of Penn&s;ylvania, yet abhor the doctrine.</P>
<P>If we look back to the origin of the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, it will appear that &s;ome among us at lea&s;t, have been con&s;tantly en|larging their views, and &s;tretching them beyond their fir&s;t bounds, till at length they have wholly changed their ground. From the claim of Parliament to tax us, &s;prung the fir&s;t re&s;i&s;tance on our part. Be|fore that unju&s;t claim was &s;et on foot, not an individual, not one of all the profound legi&s;lators with which this country abounds, ever held out the idea of independence. We con&s;idered our connection with Great-Britain as our chief happine&s;s&mdash;we flouri&s;h|ed, grew rich, and populous, to a degree

not to be paralleled in hi&s;tory. Let us then act the part of &s;kilful phi&s;icians, and wi&s;e|ly adapt the remedy to the evil.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome men may have harboured the idea of independence from the begin|ning of this controver&s;y. Indeed it was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected there were individuals who&s;e views tended that way; but as the &s;cheme was not &s;ufficiently ripened, it was reckoned &s;landerous, inimical to America, and what not, to intimate the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of this kind.</P>
<P>Nor have many weeks yet elap&s;ed &s;ince the fir&s;t open propo&s;ition for independence was publi&s;hed to the world.&mdash;By what men of con&s;equence this &s;cheme is &s;upported, or whether by any, may po&s;&s;ibly be the &s;ubject of future enquiry.&mdash;Certainly it has no coun|tenance from the Congre&s;s, to who&s;e &s;enti|ments we look up with reverence. On the contrary, it is directly repugnant to every declaration of that re&s;pectable body. It would be needle&s;s to quote particular pa&s;&s;ages in proof of this, as they are to be met with in almo&s;t every page of their proceedings. I will refer to a few only, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> their Re&s;olves, March 5, 1775&mdash;their Declaration, July 6.&mdash;their Addre&s;s to the King, July 8&mdash;their Letter to the Lord Mayor of London&mdash;and more e&s;pecially their Declaration for a fa&s;t, June 12, in which with the deepe&s;t marks of &s;incerity they call upon all America to

<P>Will any one be &s;o hardy as to &s;ay, that either the appointment or ob&s;ervation of this &s;olemn day was a mere mockery of Heaven and earth, or even that any Ameri|can joined in it, who was not &s;incere?&mdash;I tru&s;t not.

<HEAD>TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Fellow-Subjects,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"WE, the DELEGATES of the Colo|nies of New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay, Rhode-I&s;land and Provi|dence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, the Counties of Newca&s;tle Kent and Su&s;&s;ex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, and South Carolina, deputed by the inhabitants of the &s;aid Colonies to repre|&s;ent them in a general Congre&s;s at Philadel|phia, in the province of Penn&s;ylvania, to con&s;ult together concerning the be&s;t me|thods to obtain redre&s;s of our afflicting grievances, having accordingly a&s;&s;embled, and taken into our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;idera|tion the &s;tate of public affairs on this con|tinent, have thought proper to addre&s;s your province, as a member therein deeply in|tere&s;ted."</P>
<P><PB REF="043001_0094_101CC2F5B95ACCE0">
"When the fortune of war, after a gal|lant and glorious re&s;i&s;tance, had incorpo|rated you with the body of Engli&s;h &s;ub|jects, we rejoiced in the truly valuable ad|dition, both on our own and your account; expecting, as courage and genero&s;ity are naturally united, our brave enemies would become our hearty friends, and that the Divine Being would ble&s;s to you the di&s;pen|&s;ations of his over-ruling providence, by &s;ecuring to you and your late&s;t po&s;terity the ine&s;timable advantages of a free Engli&s;h con&s;titution of government, which it is the privilege of all Engli&s;h &s;ubjects to enjoy."</P>
<P>"The&s;e hopes were confirmed by the King's proclamation, i&s;&s;ued in the year 1763, plighting the public faith for your full enjoyment of tho&s;e advantages."</P>
<P>"Little did we imagine that any &s;ucceed|ing mini&s;ters would &s;o audaciou&s;ly and cru|elly abu&s;e the royal authority, as to with|hold from you the fruition of the irrevoca|ble rights, to which you were thus ju&s;tly entitled."</P>
<P>"But &s;ince we have lived to &s;ee the unex|pected time, when mini&s;ters of this flagi|tious temper have dared to violate the mo&s;t &s;acred compacts and obligations, and as you, educated under another form of go|vernment, have artfully been kept from di&s;|covering the un&s;peakable worth of <HI>that</HI> form you are now undoubtedly entitled to, we e&s;teem it our duty, for the weighty rea&s;on
<PB REF="043001_0095_101CC2F79816F630">
herein after mentioned, to explain to you &s;ome of its mo&s;t important branches."</P>
<P>"In every human &s;ociety," &s;ays the ce|lebrated Marquis <HI>Beccaria,</HI> "there is an <HI>effort, continually tending</HI> to confer on one part the heighth of power and happine&s;s, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakne&s;s and mi&s;ery. The intent of good laws is to <HI>oppo&s;e this effort,</HI> and to diffu&s;e their influence <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> and <HI>equally.</HI>"</P>
<P><Q>Rulers, &s;timulated by this pernicious effort,</Q> and &s;ubjects, animated by the ju&s;t "intent of oppo&s;ing good laws again&s;t it," have occa&s;ioned that va&s;t variety of events, that fill the hi&s;tories of &s;o many nations. All the&s;e hi&s;tories demon&s;trate the truth of this &s;imple po&s;ition, that to live by the will of one man, or &s;et of men, is the produc|tion of mi&s;ery to all men."</P>
<P>"On the &s;olid foundation of this principle, Engli&s;hmen reared up the fabrick of their con&s;titution with &s;uch a &s;trength, as for ages to defy time, tyranny, treachery, internal and foreign wars: And as an illu&s;trious author (Monte&s;quieu) of your nation, hereafter men|tioned, ob&s;erves,&mdash;"they gave the peo|ple of their colonies the form of their own government, and this government carrying pro&s;perity along with it, they have grown great nations in the fore&s;ts they were &s;ent to inhabit."</P>
<P><PB REF="043001_0096_101CC2F9243614A0">
"In this form, the fir&s;t grand right is that of the people having a &s;hare in their own government by their repre&s;entatives cho&s;en by them&s;elves, and, in con&s;equence, of be|ing ruled by <HI>laws,</HI> which they them&s;elves approve, not by <HI>edicts</HI> of <HI>men</HI> over whom they have no controul. This is a bulwark &s;urrounding and defending their property, which by their hone&s;t cares and labours they have acquired, &s;o that no portions of it can legally be taken from them, but with their own full and free con&s;ent, when they in their judgment deem it ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary to give them for public &s;ervices, and pre|ci&s;ely direct the ea&s;ie&s;t, cheape&s;t, and mo&s;t equal methods, in which they &s;hall be col|lected."</P>
<P>"The influence of this right extends &s;till farther. If money is wanted by rulers who have in any manner oppre&s;&s;ed the people, they may retain it, until their grievances are redre&s;&s;ed, and thus peaceably procure relief, without tru&s;ting to de&s;pi&s;ed petitions, or di&s;|turbing the public tranquillity."</P>
<P>"The next great right is that of trial by jury. This provides, that neither life, li|berty nor property can be taken from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, until twelve of his unexceptiona|ble countrymen and peers, of his vicinage, who from that neighbourhood may rea&s;ona|bly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be acquainted with his character, and the characters of the wit|ne&s;&s;es,
<PB REF="043001_0097_101CC2FF23FF9768">
upon a fair trial, and full enquiry face to face, in open court, before as many of the people as chu&s;e to attend, &s;hall pa&s;s their &s;entence upon oath again&s;t him; a &s;entence that cannot injure him, without injuring their own reputation, and probably their intere&s;t al&s;o; as the que&s;tion may turn on points that, in &s;ome degree, con|cern the general welfare; and if it does not, their verdict may form a precedent, that, on a &s;imilar trial of their own, may militate again&s;t them&s;elves."</P>
<P>"Another right relates merely to the liber|ty of the per&s;on. If a &s;ubject is &s;eized and impri&s;oned, though by order of govern|ment, he may, by virtue of this right, im|mediately obtain a writ, termed a Habeas Corpus, from a judge, who&s;e &s;worn duty it is to grant it, and thereupon procure any illegal re&s;traint to be quickly enquired into and redre&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>"A fourth right is that of holding lands by the tenure of ea&s;y rents, and not by rigorous and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;ervices, frequently forcing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from their families and their bu&s;ine&s;s, to perform what ought to be done, in all well regulated &s;tates, by men hired for the purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>"The la&s;t right, we &s;hall mention, regards the freedom of the pre&s;s. The importance of this con&s;i&s;ts, be&s;ides the advancement of truth, &s;cience, morality, and arts in gene|ral,
<PB REF="043001_0098_101CC3581154BBC8">
in its diffu&s;ion of liberal &s;entiments on the admini&s;tration of government, its ready communication of thoughts between &s;ub|jects, and its con&s;equential promotion of union among them, whereby oppre&s;&s;ive officers are &s;hamed or intimidated into more honorable and ju&s;t modes of conducting affairs."</P>
<P>"The&s;e are the invaluable rights, that form a con&s;iderable part of our mild &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment; that, &s;ending its equitable ener|gy through all ranks and cla&s;&s;es of men, de|fends the poor from the rich, the weak from the powerful, the indu&s;trious from the ra|pacious, the peaceable from the violent, the tenants from the lords, and all from their &s;uperiors."</P>
<P>"The&s;e are the rights, without which a people cannot be free and happy, and un|der the protecting and encouraging influence of which, the&s;e colonies have hitherto &s;o amazingly flouri&s;hed and increa&s;ed. The&s;e are the rights, a profligate mini&s;try are now &s;triving, by force of arms, to ravi&s;h from us, and which we are, with one mind, re|&s;olved never to re&s;ign but with our lives."</P>
<P>"THESE ARE THE RIGHTS, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO, AND OUGHT AT THIS MOMENT IN PERFECTION TO EXERCISE."</P>

<HEAD>ADDITIONS TO PLAIN TRUTH: CONTAINING, Further Remarks on a late PAMPHLET, entitled COMMON SENSE.</HEAD>
<P>THE writer of PLAIN TRUTH, grieved at the in&s;idious purpo&s;e of the Pam|phlet, entitled COMMON SENSE, ar|dently wi&s;hed to &s;ee its Antichri&s;tian tenets expo&s;ed to public dete&s;tation. After in vain, waiting &s;everal weeks in expectation of its being an&s;wered, he at length ha&s;tily endeavoured to refute its pernicious doc|trines; and therefore wi&s;hes the judicious reader to pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e the following ob&s;ervations, intended as additional to his former re|marks.</P>
<P>In our former ob&s;ervations, we intimated that many pages might be filled with enco|miums on our excellent con&s;titution, by illu&s;trious authors of different nations. We hope the candid reader will be grati|fied with the following extracts on that &s;ubject, by that univer&s;al genius Voltaire,
<PB N="98" REF="043001_0101_101CC3040F95C2E8">
and by the almo&s;t in&s;pired Monte&s;quieu, &s;o honorably di&s;tingui&s;hed by our re&s;pectable Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>"The Engli&s;h nation are the only peo|ple on earth, who, re&s;i&s;ting prerogative, happily re&s;trained it: Who, by efforts to efforts, at length e&s;tabli&s;hed that <HI>wi&s;e go|vernment,</HI> where the Prince all powerful to do good, has his hands tied from doing evil; where the nobility great without in|&s;olence, and va&s;&s;als, and where the people partake the government without <HI>confu&s;ion.</HI> The Hou&s;e of Peers and Hou&s;e of Commons are the arbitrators of the nation; the King is the umpire. This balance was wanting to the Romans; the Patricians and people were always divided at Rome, without a mitigating power to reconcile them. The Senate of Rome, who had the unju&s;t and puni&s;hable pride to &s;hare no part of their power with the Plebeians, knew no other &s;ecret to remove them from government, than to employ them continually in foreign wars; they regarded the people, as a bea&s;t of prey, whom it was nece&s;&s;ary to let loo&s;e on their neighbours, lea&s;t he &s;hould tear his ma&s;ter. Thus, the greate&s;t fault of the government of the Romans made them conquerors; it was, becau&s;e they were
<PB N="99" REF="043001_0102_101CC30A092D2AB8">
wretched at home, that they conquered the world."</P>
<P>Monte&s;quieu al&s;o affirms that "the Bri|ti&s;h government is the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t in Europe,</HI> be|cau&s;e, there is a body which examines it perpetually, and is perpetually examining it&s;elf; and its errors are of &s;uch a nature, as <HI>never to be la&s;ting,</HI> and are frequently u&s;eful by rou&s;ing the attention of the na|tion." In &s;hort, the man who in prefe|rence to the&s;e authorities, and the te&s;timony of ages, can believe our author's criminal a&s;&s;ertions again&s;t the con&s;titution, in our very humble opinion, is incapable of being rea&s;oned with.</P>
<P>The reader, often accu&s;tomed to hear our numbers exaggerated, will with &s;ur|pri&s;e be told, that the free people in the Briti&s;h Colonies do not exceed 1,500,000.</P>
<P>The writer of Common Sen&s;e, and his partizans, to promote their flagitious pur|po&s;es, endeavour to make the world be|lieve, that the number of our free people amount to three millions. The&s;e per&s;ons who have &s;o excellent a knack of creating armies, and navies, &s;uppo&s;e 900,000 peo|ple in Virginia and Maryland, although the&s;e provinces only contain 280,000 white people.</P>
<P>By <HI>examining,</HI> the list of <HI>taxables</HI> in
<PB N="100" REF="043001_0103_101CC30CB105B690">
Virginia and Maryland, and the battalions now on foot in the&s;e provinces, &s;uch, as doubt our computations, may &s;atisfy them|&s;elves, that we are not widely mi&s;taken. If I am told that 72 counties are included in Virginia and Maryland, I reply, that they do not comprehend half the number of people contained in York&s;hire. The num|ber of white people therefore in the diffe|rent provinces, may be truly &s;tated in the following manner; in the &s;outhern colo|nies, 450,000, in the middle colonies, 550,000, in the New England colonies, 500,000. Thus exten&s;ively disjoined, the&s;e numbers form not &s;o great a national &s;trength, as would half that number united in a compact territory. Now, a &s;tate, con|taining 1,500,000 people, cannot <HI>prudently</HI> keep up more than 15,000 &s;oldiers. A per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &pound; 1000 may indeed for &s;ome time di&s;play the expence of him &s;ei&s;ed of &pound; 1000 yearly revenue, but he will affect &s;uch imprudent parade at the expence of his <HI>ruin.</HI> On &s;uch, and no other principle, may a community of 1,500,000 arm more than 15,000 men.</P>

for that noble purpo&s;e ONLY: The com|mand of which, were given to the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, Lord Fairfax, and other pre&s;byteri|ans as truly virtuous, as any men then on earth. It is notorious that tho&s;e leaders, as well as every virtuous patriot in the king|dom, reprobated the thought of de&s;troying that con&s;titution, which they &s;o often bled to defend. At the commencement of tho&s;e unhappy times, Cromwell po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no fortune, &s;carcely ranked as a field officer. This execrable hypocrite, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing exten|&s;ive military talents, and a mo&s;t perfect knowlege of mankind, &s;aw with plea&s;ure, that &s;oldiers accu&s;tomed to a life of every &s;pecies of di&s;&s;ipation, would not willingly return to their ploughs, looms, &amp;c.

Cromwell, and his congenial a&s;&s;ociates, by degrees acquainted the &s;oldiers with their real &s;trength and in|tere&s;ts.

We mu&s;t confe&s;s that the advancement of the adjoining middle colonies in indu&s;try and morality, was prin|cipally owing to the very laudable and pow|erful example of tho&s;e real practicers of chri&s;tianity. This hone&s;t truth is dictated in gratitude for the &s;ignal ble&s;&s;ings derived to the community at large in the virtuous example of tho&s;e indu&s;trious and peaceable morali&s;ts.

The original inhabitants in&s;tead of flying into their fore&s;ts, in&s;en&s;ibly accu&s;tomed them|&s;elves with the peaceable Quakers. As much as they dete&s;ted the other CHRIS|TIAN DESTROYERS and conquerors of America, as much did they LOVE the&s;e new comers. In a little time, tho&s;e pre|tended &s;avages charmed with their new neighbours, came in crouds to reque&s;t WILLIAM PENN to receive them in the number of his va&s;&s;als.

<P>On this occa&s;ion, perhaps it may not be ami&s;s to remind the public, that great pa|triots have more than once been caught nap|ping. Let us hear what the Dean of Glo|ce&s;ter &s;ays on this head.</P>
<P>"When the duty on &s;tamps was fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed, the Americans made as little objecti|on to it, as could be expected to be made to any new tax whatever. Nay, &s;everal of their popular orators and leaders u&s;ed con&s;iderable intere&s;t to be employed as agents in the di&s;tribution of the&s;e &s;tamps: and one among the re&s;t, whom I NEED NOT NAME, was more than ordinary a&s;&s;idu|ous in his application on this head: &s;o that had the act pa&s;&s;ed within the u&s;ual time, in&s;tead of being a flaming American patri|ot, he would probably have acted the part of a tax-gatherer and an American publi|can. But when the outs and the pouters on this &s;ide the water, &s;aw the advantage which the mini&s;ter gave them by a whole year's delay, they eagerly &s;ei&s;ed the opportunity; emi&s;&s;aries and agents were di&s;patched into all quarters; the new&s;papers were filled with invectives again&s;t the new intended tax. It was injudicious! it was ill-timed! oppre&s;|&s;ive! tyrannical! and every thing that was bad! Letters upon letters were wrote to America to excite the people to a&s;&s;ociate, to remon&s;trate, and even to revolt. The

mo&s;t ample promi&s;es were made from hence of giving them all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which fac|tion and clamour, and mock-patrioti&s;m, could mu&s;ter up. And then it was that this very man, this &s;elf intended publican, changed &s;ides, and commenced a zealous patriot. Then he appeared at the bar of the hou&s;e of commons to cry down that very mea&s;ure which he him&s;elf had e&s;pou&s;|ed; and then as the avenging Angel of America.</P>
<L>He rode in the whirlwind to direct the Storm."</L>
<P>Even &s;incere Patriots are fallible, and at &s;ome periods, do not &s;ee the true intere&s;ts of their country, in the cleare&s;t light. Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to under&s;tand the true intere&s;t of America would reap u&s;eful knowledge, by peru&s;ing the pamphlet from which the la&s;t paragraph is extract|ed, it is entitled, "The true intere&s;t of Great-Britain, &s;et forth in regard to the Co|lonies; and the only means of living in peace and harmony with them; in which are included FIVE different PLANS for effecting this de&s;irable purpo&s;e. By Jo&s;iah Tucker, D. D. Dean of Gloce&s;ter.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in men|tioning this piece, becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded (notwith&s;tanding the mini&s;terial attempts to ruin this Country) that the intere&s;t of Britain and America are &s;o nearly related, and their commercial felicity &s;o dependent upon reciprocality of kindne&s;&s;es to each other, THAT HONORABLE CONNECTIONS,
<PB N="136" REF="043001_0139_101CC3693A154B10">
AND POLITICAL HAPPINESS, ARE SYNONYMOUS TERMS.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, let us remember, that reconcili|ation on generous principles with Great Britain, is our true and only road to per|manent happine&s;s. Above all, let us &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider, that this (when the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners arrive to treat with the Congre&s;s) is the juncture, this the moment, when we may receive every thing we can rea&s;onably de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I conclude the&s;e remarks, by ob&s;erving, that if they are founded in truth, they will in&s;truct you to keep a good look out, that ye may not be &s;urprized into AMERICAN INDEPENDENCY; without a thorough examination, both of it, and its con&s;equences.</P>
