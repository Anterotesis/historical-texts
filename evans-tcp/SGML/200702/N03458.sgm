<P>THE Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the be&s;t, and mo&s;t perfect Pattern, mo&s;t worthy of Imitation; he that &s;aith, he abideth in him, ought al&s;o &s;o to walk, as he walk|ed, 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 6</P>
<P>Wherefore the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> having in the for|mer Chapter exhorted Believers to patient bear|ing Afflictions by the Example of Chri&s;t, <HI>Ver.</HI> 18. He proceeds in this to per&s;wade them to improve the Cro&s;s they have outwardly, to inward Mortifi|cation. Chri&s;t's Death is propo&s;ed to us in Scrip|ture as an Examplar both of external Mortification

in bearing Reproaches, Per&s;ecution, and all other Troubles; this the Apo&s;tle pro&s;ecutes in the for|mer Chapter, and of internal in the de&s;troying the Body of Sin; this he exhorts to in this Chapter, and draws his Argument from Chri&s;t's Death, not only as the Examplar, but efficient and meritori|ous Cau&s;e of our Mortification, and which hath a real Influence upon it, in that Chri&s;t by his Death did not only merit the Pardon of Sin, but the gi|ving the Spirit, whereby Corruption might be de&s;troyed, and our Natures renewed. And being armed with this Mind, that we being dead with Chri&s;t to Sin, &s;hould not live any longer in it, or be &s;educed by the corrupt De&s;ires, and &s;inful Ways of carnal Men, and make them the Rule of our Living: But the holy Will of God revealed in his Word, (which is the Rule by which we ought to walk) in Oppo&s;ition to the Lu&s;ts of Men, we are to live not as Men would have us, but as God commands. Since every one of us &s;hall give an Account, whether he be high or low, rich or poor, great or &s;mall, &s;trong or weak, &amp;c. Of him&s;elf, of his own Actions, and not another's; he &s;hall give an Account of him&s;elf in his natural Capacity, as a Man, and in his Capacity as a rich or great Man, and in his religious Capacity, as one that hath enjoyed &s;uch Education, &s;uch Means of Grace, &amp;c. I &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle in my Text, <HI>He &s;hall give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</HI> Give Account, i.e. come to a Reckoning, and an&s;wer for his Offices, Relations and Behaviour in the World <HI>To him,</HI> i. e. to God and Chri&s;t <HI>That is ready,</HI> i. e. fit, prepared, well furni&s;hed and near at hand. <HI>To judge,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. to pronounce a righteous and true Sentence upon all Things and Per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004230_0005_1004023009FD9A18">
From this Text, thus briefly opened, we ob&s;erve the following Doctrine: Namely,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCT. That it is a Matter of the highe&s;t Con|cernment and Importance to Men, to be ready to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</HEAD>
<P>That the Judge of all Things and Per&s;ons &s;tands ready to call all Men to a &s;trict Account of all their Actions and Deportments in this World, is undoubtedly true. The Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> witne&s;|eth, Chap. v. Ver. 9. <HI>Grudge not one again&s;t ano|ther, Brethren, le&s;t ye be condemned: Behold, the Judge &s;tandeth before the Door:</HI> i. e. He is in a Readine&s;s to bring tho&s;e Evils upon Men, which they wi&s;h may fall upon others; or to give their Reward to them, <HI>who through patient Continuance in well doing &s;eek for it,</HI> Rom ii. 7. And it is ob|&s;ervable, that our Text is a Metaphor taken from Stewards giving Account to their Ma&s;ters. <HI>Mat.</HI> xviii. 25 Luke xvi. 2. <HI>Give an Account of thy Ste|ward&s;hip, for thou maye&s;t be no longer Steward.</HI> If we carefully attend to the De&s;ign and Aim of the Parable of which the Text la&s;t mentioned is a Part, we &s;hall ea&s;ily &s;ee, that the main Things in which our Saviour &s;eemeth de&s;irous by this Parable to in&s;truct us are two; the one, that we are but Stewards of the good Things God lends us, and mu&s;t give an Ac|count to our Ma&s;ter for them. And the other, That being no other than Stewards intru&s;ted with &s;ome of our Ma&s;ter's Goods for a Time, it is our highe&s;t Prudence, while we have them in our Tru&s;t, to make &s;uch an U&s;e of them, as may be for our Advantage, when we give up our Account.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004230_0006_10042433C286E190">
In the handling of the Doctrine, I &s;hall endea|vour to &s;hew,</P>
<P>I. That Men &s;hall give an Account to God that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</P>
<P>II. That it is of the highe&s;t Concernment &amp; Im|portance to them to be ready to do it.</P>
<P>III. That God is ready to take an Account of all Men. And</P>
<P>IV. Make an Application &s;utable to the awful and affecting Occa&s;ion of this Day.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e in their Order. And</P>
<P>I. <HI>That Men &s;hall give an Account to God that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead</HI> This Men &s;hall do immediately after the Separation of the Soul from the Body; and as it is <HI>appointed un|to Men ouce to die, but after this the Judgment,</HI> Heb. ix. 27. After Souls by Death are &s;eparated from their Bodies, they come to Judgment; and thus every particular Man is handed over by Death to the Bar of God, the great Judge, and &s;o is di&s;|patch'd by his Sentence to it's particular State and Place with it's re&s;pective People, Rom. xiv. 12. <HI>So then every one of us mu&s;t give an Account of him&s;elf to God.</HI> At the great and general A&s;&s;ize, the Day of Judgment, &s;hall the general and univer&s;al One take Place. Acts xvii 31 <HI>Becau&s;e he hath ap|pointed a Day in the which he will judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given A&s;&s;urance unto all Men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the Dead.</HI> When all Sinners in their entire Per&s;ons, Bodies and Souls united, &s;hall be adjudged to their final unaltera|ble and eternal State. Rom. xiv. 10. <HI>But why do&s;t thou judge thy Brother? Or why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy Brother? for we &s;hall all &s;tand,</HI> or be &s;et, <HI>before the Judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004230_0007_10042436F9A533C0">
There is a Variety of Scripture that leads us to the Knowlege, and &s;hould al&s;o lead us to the Acknowlegement of this nece&s;&s;ary Point, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That every one a&s;&s;oon as his Spirit takes it's la&s;t Farewell of his Body, makes his Appearance be|fore the impartial Tribunal of God, and that then a righteous and true Sentence is pa&s;&s;ed without any Delay, whereby their future State is unalter|ably, and irrevocably determined. Luke xvi 22, 23. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's Bo&s;om: the rich Man al&s;o died and was buried. And in Hell he lift up his Eyes being in Torments.</HI> The parti|cular Judgment of every &s;ingle Man follows im|mediately his Departure out of this Life. The Souls of wicked Men depart to go to their own Place, <HI>Acts</HI> i 25. The Souls of wicked Men are no le&s;s puni&s;hed in Hell than the apo&s;tate Angels, <HI>Jude Ver.</HI> 6, 7. And the Spirits of them who in the Time of <HI>Noah</HI> were di&s;obedient, are &s;aid to be in Pri&s;on. 1 Pet. iii. 19. <HI>And preached unto the Spirits in Pri&s;on:</HI> That is Souls of Men departed, which are frequently called Spirits. <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> xii. 7. <HI>Acts</HI> vii 59. In Pri&s;on, that is Hell. So it is ta|ken, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxvii 20. compared with <HI>Mat.</HI> v. 25. This is the State of the Wicked to which their Souls are ca&s;t immediately after Death, where they remain in Torments and utter Darkne&s;s, re|&s;erved to the Judgment of the great Day. But the Souls of the Righteous after Death are with Chri&s;t in Heaven, and enjoy that ble&s;&s;ed Vi&s;ion, <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 23. Chri&s;t promi&s;ed that the Thief on the Cro&s;s &s;hould be with him in Paradi&s;e, that very &s;ame Day he died, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 43. (And it will be a happy Exchange for thy Soul, when by and by it takes its Flight from thy Body, if this may be thy

Lot.) The Spirits of ju&s;t Men after Death return to God, and are received by God, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> xii. 7. Though <HI>Solomon</HI> only may &s;peak here of the Peo|ple of God, yet &s;ome under&s;tand it of the Souls both of Believers, and Unbelievers, which are both &s;entenced by God as &s;upream Judge, imme|diately when a Man dieth, every Man to his Place, the Souls of Believers to Heaven, of Unbelievers to Hell. Thus I leave the fir&s;t, and proceed to treat of the &s;econd Article of the Doctrine; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>II. <HI>That it is of the highe&s;t Concernment and Im|portance to Men, to be ready to give up their Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick &amp; the Dead.</HI> Our principal Concern and Bu&s;ine&s;s in this World, is to prepare for another. And this is to be done by improving all we are and have to God's Glory, which is the principal End of our Creation, and all the Ble&s;&s;ings and good Things which our heaven|ly Father freely, and unde&s;ervedly be&s;tows upon us. It is a Ju&s;tice due from us to God, to promote and maintain his Glory in the World. <Q>Do we &s;wear, &s;aith a Heathen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Arria</HI> in Epict</NOTE>, to prefer none before <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and have we not greater Rea&s;on to prefer none before God.</Q> What we have, ought to be u&s;ed for the Honour of God the Giver: He never dive&s;ts him&s;elf of the Dominion and Lord&s;hip of his Creatures; he only grants us the U&s;e, not the Abu&s;e of them. We are but Stewards, not Pro|prietors, in Regard of God who expects an Ac|count from us how we have employed his Goods for his Honour and Prai&s;e in the World.</P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance of this Part of the Doctrine, I have a fair Opportunity given me to enter upon
<PB N="7" REF="004230_0009_10042441DCF767C0">
the Con&s;ideration and Re&s;olution of two Que&s;ti|ons; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>How &s;hall Men prepare to give an Ac|count to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead?</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. 2. <HI>What makes it of &s;o great Concernment and Importance to Men, to prepare to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick &amp; the Dead?</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are Que&s;tions of great Moment, and de|&s;erve full and di&s;tinct An&s;wers: But I mu&s;t be as clear and comprehen&s;ive as I can in the&s;e, and the other Parts of the Doctrine, con&s;idering the &s;canty Mea&s;ure of Time now left me. I re&s;ume the fir&s;t Que&s;tion which is,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How &s;hall Men prepare to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead?</HI></P>
<P>This now is to be con&s;idered and re&s;olved in this general Manner, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> They that will have the Crown of Glory determined for them at God's Tribunal, mu&s;t run for it, they mu&s;t &s;o run as to obtain it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix. 24. This is a Work which requires much Striving and Labour: Men mu&s;t make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s not only to do Things in them&s;elves lawful or good, but which are &s;o cloath|ed in all their Circum&s;tances, and in the be&s;t Man|ner for the Glory of God, and the Good of others. Forgetting tho&s;e Things which are behind, and reaching forth unto tho&s;e Things which are before. To be &s;o intent upon this one Thing, as if there were not any thing el&s;e worthy of their Thoughts and Care. <HI>One Thing have I de&s;ired of the Lord,</HI> (&s;aith <HI>David) that will I &s;eek after, that I may dwell in the Hou&s;e of the Lord all the Days of my Life, to behold the Beauty</HI> (or the Delights, <HI>Marg) of the Lord, and to inquire in his Temple,</HI> P&s;alm xxvi. 4. Tru&s;ting that they &s;hall through Grace,
<PB N="8" REF="004230_0010_1004244914755DA0">
be kept all along, Maugre all Difficulties in the Hand of Chri&s;t, till upon his Account they &s;hall be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all they aim at, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the purcha&s;ed Inheritance eternally &s;ettled upon the Sons of God. <HI>Laying a&s;ide every Weight, and the Sin that doth &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et them, and running with Patience the Race that is &s;et before them,</HI> Heb. xii. 1. Put|ting off the old Man, the corrupt Nature which remained in every Chri&s;tian, &s;tiled by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, The Body of Death,</HI> Rom. vii. 24. But e&s;|pecially every Chri&s;tian his own per&s;onal, &amp; proper Iniquity, which cleaves nearer and clo&s;er to him than his Garments, improving daily holy <HI>David'</HI>s Care and Study in P&s;alm xviii. 23. <HI>I was al&s;o up|right before him, and kept my &s;elf from mine own Iniquity.</HI> This they are to mortify in them, that how di&s;tant &s;oever the Goal is, which fini&s;heth the Race of a Chri&s;tian's Life, yet the Way pa&s;|&s;ing to it, though it be trouble&s;ome and long, and be &s;et to us all by God him&s;elf, mu&s;t be patiently, &s;trenuo&s;ly and con&s;tantly run that they may obtain it. P&s;alm cxix 32, 33. <HI>I will run the Way of thy Commandments, when thou &s;halt enlarge my Heart. Teach me, O Lord, the Way of thy Statutes, and I &s;hall keep it unto the End.</HI> In a Word, The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> gives us the Sub&s;tance of this in a few Words, 2 Tim iv. 7. <HI>I have fought the good Fight, I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e, I have kept the Faith.</HI> The Life of a Chri&s;tian, of him that would prepare for Death, and the Judgment which im|mediately follows after it, &s;hould be a military Life, but they mu&s;t not fight the evil Fights of ambiti|ous or quarrel&s;ome Men, but their Fighting &s;hould be the good and noble Fight of Faith, a daily Con|flict with the World, the Fle&s;h and the Devil, con|tending for the Faith delivered to the Saints <HI>Ex|erci&s;ing
<PB N="9" REF="004230_0011_1004244C5B160560">
them&s;elves unto Godline&s;s,</HI> 1 Tim. iv 7. Their con&s;tant Study &s;hould be Things that promote Godline&s;s, imparting tho&s;e Things unto others, and living up to them in their own Conver&s;ation; herein exerci&s;ing them&s;elves to have always Con|&s;ciences void of Offence, toward God, and toward Men, improving all their Care and Thought chief|ly that they may not offend GOD or Men in any Thing, but that they may be without Blame at the Judgment of God, as well as of Man. They only are ble&s;&s;ed and happy who&s;e Belief concern|ing another World, and the Account they have to give to God (who will bring every Work into Judgment, with every &s;ecret Thing) do make them endeavour after Holine&s;s in this World. Thus have we con&s;idered and re&s;olved the fir&s;t Que&s;tion, and proceed next to the &s;econd Que&s;tion, which is,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What makes it of &s;o great Concernment and Importance to Men to prepare to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead?</HI> Many are the forceable, &amp; cogent Arguments and Motives that might here be &s;ubjoined to &s;upport and re&s;olve this Que&s;tion I &s;hall mention a few of them, and I mu&s;t but ju&s;t mention them.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Certainty of the Account to be given by all Men to God</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> in our Text a&s;|certains it, <HI>Who &s;hall give an Account,</HI> &amp;c It is a Matter not to be doubted of, they &s;hall not fail of doing it. <HI>I &s;aid in my Heart,</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Solomon) God &s;hall judge the Righteous and the Wicked,</HI> Eccl. iii. 17 <HI>So then, every one of us mu&s;t give an Account of him&s;elf to God,</HI> Rom. xiv. 12. Men &s;hall certainly give an Account to God&punc; whether they be Supe|riours, Inferiours, or Equals; and in what&s;oever
<PB N="10" REF="004230_0012_1004244E155885F8">
Station and Relation, they &s;tand in the World. Heb. xiii. 17. <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and &s;ubmit your &s;elves, for they watch for your Souls, as they that mu&s;t give Account,</HI> Not only Mini&s;ters, but Magi&s;trates, yea all Men in their &s;e|veral Capacities, Relations &amp; Conditions in this Life, mu&s;t do it, they mu&s;t certainly appear before the Bar of God, who will call all Men unto Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Account to be given to God by Men, is very Exten&s;ive.</HI> It will reach unto all the Deportments, Degrees and Periods of a Man's Life; even their idle Words will be brought unto the Reckoning. Mat. xii. 36. <HI>But I &s;ay unto you, that every idle Word that Men &s;hall &s;peak, they &s;hall give account thereof in the Day of Judgment. Rejoyce O young Man in thy Youth,</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Solomon) and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth and walk in the Ways of thy Heart, and in the Sight of thine Eyes, but know thou that for all the&s;e Things God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI> The mo&s;t &s;ecretoins &s;hall not e&s;cape the Notice and Cen&s;ure of the Judge: <HI>For God &s;hall bring every Work into Judgment, with e|very &s;ecret Thing, whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</HI> Eccl. xii. 14.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It will be an impartial and critical Account. Unto thee, O Lord belongeth Mercy, for thou rendre&s;t to every Man according to his Work,</HI> P&s;alm lxii 22. God will judge every Man according (not to what others have done, but) to what he him&s;elf hath done. His eternal Joy and Rejoycing, or Sorrow and Mourning &s;hall be according to what he him|&s;elf hath wrought, not according to what others hath wrought <HI>For every Man &s;hall bear his own Burden,</HI> Gal. vi 5. If ever they enter into the Joy of Heaven, they &s;hall rejoyce in their own Work, and if eternal Sorrow be their Portion, they &s;hall
<PB N="11" REF="004230_0013_100424579DD40450">
groan under their own Burdens, they will not be the Sins of others, but their own Sins which will &s;ink them into eternal Mi&s;ery. For though Supe|riours &s;hall an&s;wer to God for the Sins of their In|feriours, yet it &s;hall not properly be for their In|feriours Sins, but for their own Sins, in neglecting to warn &amp; reprove them, and to do what in them lay to have hindred them in their &s;inful Cour&s;es. For the Lord our God judgeth righteou&s;ly, he try|eth the Reins and the Heart, <HI>Jer.</HI> xi 20. He is a ju&s;t God, who will deal with all according to their Works. He is a God that takes notice not only of overt Acts, that are &s;candalous and crimi|nal, but of the &s;ecret Thoughts, Motions and De|&s;igns of Men's Hearts, Rev. ii 23. <HI>I will kill her Children with Death; and all the Churches &s;hall know that I am he which &s;earcheth the Reins and the Hearts, and I will give every one of you accord|ing to your Works.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Account may be very &s;udden and unexpect|ed.</HI> Many a Candle is extingui&s;hed before it be half burnt out, many a clear Morning is overca&s;t and clouded before Noon. Oh, how many &s;ud|den &amp; untimely Deaths have we &s;een, and heard of in our Day? And how little do Men lay it to Heart? The Sun knoweth his going down, but no Man knoweth the Day or Hour of his Di&s;&s;olution and Judgment. Good old <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> he <HI>knew not the Day of his Death,</HI> Gen. xxvii. 2 Neverthele&s;s Man's <HI>Days are determined the Number of his Months is with God, who hath appointed his Bounds that he cannot pa&s;s,</HI> and Man <HI>&s;hall accompli&s;h as an Hireling his Day,</HI> Job xiv. 5, 6. Yet the particu|lar Day of a Man's Death is uncertain&punc; and may be very &s;udden with Re&s;pect to any Man. <HI>Boa&s;t not thy &s;elf of to-morrow,</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Solomon) for thou
<PB N="12" REF="004230_0014_1004245924537810">
knowe&s;t not what a Day may bring forth,</HI> Prov. xxvii 1. Not only daily Ob&s;ervation and Expe|rience, but many Scripture Records give Te&s;timo|ny to this Truth. <HI>Nadab</HI> &amp; <HI>Abihu</HI> offered &s;trange Fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not, and there went out Fire from the Lord, and devoured them, &amp; they died before the Lord, <HI>Lev.</HI> x. 1, 2. Again, It was a &s;udden &amp; unexpected Death and Judgment, which the Lord's of the Phili&s;tines met with, when the Hou&s;e wherein they were fea&s;ting and rejoycing, fell upon them by the Hands of <HI>Sam&s;on, Judges</HI> xvi 30 And <HI>Job'</HI>s Chil|dren, (though he was a very good Man) were overtaken with a very &s;udden and unlook'd for End; when they were rejoycing together, <HI>behold there came a great Wind from the Wilderne&s;s, and &s;mote the four Corners of the Hou&s;e, and it fell upon the young Men, and they are dead,</HI> Job i. 19. How &s;udden and unexpected &s;oever Death comes, &s;o &s;udden the Judgment, <HI>for after this the Judgment,</HI> Heb. ix. 27.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>A joyful Sentence of endle&s;s Bli&s;s and Glory &s;hall at Death be pronounced on all them that are ready and prepared to give up their Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</HI> They &s;hall near a Voice from Heaven pronouncing their welcome Sentence upon them. Rev. xiv. 13. <HI>And I heard a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying unto me, Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea &s;aith the Spirit&punc; that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI> They &s;hall be at Re&s;t from the Troubles of this Life, and their good Deeds and patient Sufferings, &s;hall follow them as Witne&s;&s;es for them before the Judge of the Quick &amp; the Dead.

<P N="6">6. <HI>The Account will be terrible and &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;uch as are unprepared, and unprovided, to give Ac|count to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</HI> Their Sentence will be, <HI>Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> Mat. xxv. 41. The Judg|ment of the Wicked is to eternal Mi&s;ery; lying in two Things. (1.) In a Departure from God, &s;o as never more to have any Favour from him. (2.) In a Sen&s;e of Pain and Mi&s;ery, exceeding that which Fire cau&s;eth to a Body con&s;uming with it.

<P N="7">7. La&s;tly, <HI>The righteous Sentence that &s;hall be pronounced by God the righteous Judge, upon every Man at Death, &s;hall be deri&s;ive and irrevocable.</HI> Here there is left no Room for Abatement, Ap|peal or Review. There can be no Eva&s;ion at God's Bar, for he is Judge alone, and is ju&s;tified when he &s;peaketh and clear when he judgeth, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> li. 4.

And the Glutton is tormented forever in that Place without the lea&s;t Hopes of Reprieve or E&s;cape. The State of the Damned will be void of any De|gree of Comfort or Satisfaction. But the Souls of good Men when they leave their Bodies, go into an unalterable E&s;tate of eternal Bli&s;s, where are <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and enjoy a Felicity, which we are not able to expre&s;s, but is &s;et out to us under the Notion of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Bo&s;om, to let us know that it is a Place of Re&s;t and Communion with Saints, and the &s;ame Felicity which <HI>Abraham the Friend of God</HI> doth enjoy. <HI>For we know,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, 2 Cor.

Come we now to the third general Point in the Doctrine, which is,</P>
<P>III. <HI>That God is ready to take an Account of Men.</HI> He is always &s;it, prepared, furni&s;hed and well appointed, to &s;it upon his Judgment-Seat, and pronounce Sentence according to the various Ca&s;es and Suits of all that are &s;ummoned, to appear be|fore him. <HI>Behold the Judge &s;tandeth before the Door,</HI> James v. 9 But &s;ome Men wi&s;h there were no God, no Judge to call them unto an Ac|count. <HI>The Fool hath &s;aid in his Heart there is no God,</HI> P&s;alm xiv. 1. That is, he wi&s;hes there were no God, for he &s;ees nothing but Matter of Fear, Terror and Amazement round about. As the Wicked here lived without the Bounds of God's Law, they are afraid to fall under the Stroke of his Ju&s;tice: Fear wi&s;hes the De&s;truction of that which it apprehends hurtful: And the amazing Fear of the Wicked con&s;iders God as a God to whom Vengeance belongs, as the Judge of all the Earth, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> liv. 12.</P>
<P>That God is prepared, and inconte&s;tably well furni&s;hed to take an Account of Men, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure appear from the few following Con&s;ide|rations.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is a nece&s;&s;ary Point of your Faith to believe that there is a God that will call us all (in our Time and Order) to an Account, and that with him there are future Rewards and Puni&s;hments.</HI> We &s;hould humbly and feelingly acknowlege with holy <HI>David, Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous, verily, he is a God that judgeth in the Earth,</HI> P&s;alm lviii. 11.

To God the &s;overeign Being, the &s;upream and univer&s;al Lawgiver and Judge, doth belong the univer&s;al Right and Power of vindictive Ju&s;tice, it is his Propriety, as he will avenge all Injuries again&s;t his People, he will much more avenge the Sins and Injuries again&s;t his Son, and will actually return to Evil-Doers as a Recompence for their Sins the Evil of Puni&s;hment.

powerful, but actually manife&s;ting both in his Re|tribution on them. Deut. xxxii. 41. <HI>If I whet my glittering Sword and mine Hand take hold on Judg|ment, I will render Vengeance to mine Enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</HI> If Men did be|lieve, and con&s;tantly revere this Truth, it is im|po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould allow them&s;elves in &s;o many Crimes as they are guilty of, and daily per|petrating. But before I fini&s;h this U&s;e, I mu&s;t take leave to mention a few Errors and Ob|jections alledged and maintained by &s;ome Adver|&s;aries to this Truth, and offer Scripture Confuta|tion of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Arminians</HI> and &s;ome others &s;ay, the Souls of the Righteous are not pre&s;ently after Death, admitted to enjoy Happine&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;eeing of God, but are put into &s;ome Man&s;ion, though it be not a heavenly one, yet a Place above Hell, where they enjoy, even until the Re&s;urrection, &s;ome heavenly Delight and Re|creation, without &s;eeing God. And the <HI>Soci|nians</HI> likewi&s;e tell us, that the Souls of the Righ|teous after Death, until the Re&s;urrection are (as it were) extingui&s;hed. The&s;e Errors are broach|ed and maintained in Oppo&s;ition to many expre&s;s Texts of Scripture, as <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> xii. 7. where the wi&s;e Man declares that the Spirits of ju&s;t Men af|ter Death, return to God and are rewarded by him. And the Protomartyr <HI>Stephen</HI> died in the Belief of this Truth, and &s;ealed it with his Blood, <HI>Acts</HI> vii. 59. <HI>And they &s;toned Stephen, calling upon God, and &s;aying, Lord Je&s;us receive my Spirit.</HI> A|greably the Author of the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, That the Spirits of ju&s;t Men are made perfect in Holine&s;s, and placed in the heavenly Jeru&s;alem, with the Angels, <HI>Heb</HI> xii. 22, 23. And
<PB N="22" REF="004230_0024_10040233CF7D8BB0">
a more excellent Author, namely, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Lord of Glory intimates <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 22, 25. That the Souls of the Righteous after Death are com|forted, and carried into <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Bo&s;om.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Greeks</HI> and others alledge and maintain that the Souls of the Wicked are not adjudged to the Torments of Hell, till after the Re&s;urrection: And the <HI>Socinians</HI> go &s;till farther, &s;aying, that the Souls of the Wicked &s;hall never be tormented in Hell. The&s;e Errors contradict the &s;acred Text, in &s;undry Places, and In&s;tances, Heb. ix. 27. <HI>And as it is appointed unto Men once to die, but after this the Judgment.</HI> Which evidently &s;heweth, that the particular Judgment of every &s;ingle Man follows immediately his Departure out of this Life: Of this al&s;o In&s;tances &s;hall now be produced, name|ly, The Soul of the rich Glutton which was tor|mented in Hell Flames after it left the Body, <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 22, 23. And <HI>Judas</HI> was &s;truck into his own Place, <HI>Acts</HI> i. 25.</P>
<P N="3">3 Very gro&s;s and ab&s;urd are the Errors which <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> have framed again&s;t this Doctrine, who (albeit the holy Scripture doth not acknowlege any other Place than Heaven and Hell for Souls, departed from their Bodies) yet have devi&s;ed o|ther four be&s;ides the&s;e two; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Limbus Patrum, Limbus Infantum, a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Meadow, and Purgatory.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Limbus Patrum,</HI> in which (&s;ay they) the faithful who died before Chri&s;t's Pa&s;&s;ion have been &s;hut up as in a dark Pri&s;on under Ground, and be|ing without Torment, and for the Time without Happine&s;s, have been kept clo&s;e there until Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven. In An&s;wer hereto, we &s;hould remember what is already noted from <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 22, 23. To which
<PB N="23" REF="004230_0025_10042490DB0FFA80">
we may add, that the Vertue of Chri&s;t's Sacrifice did no le&s;s extend it &s;elf to Believers under the old Te&s;tament, than the new. We are told, Rev. xiii 8. <HI>All that dwell upon the Earth &s;hall wor&s;hip him, who&s;e Names are not written in the Book of the Lamb &s;lain from the Foundation of the World.</HI> And the Example of <HI>Enoch,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> which two before the Pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t were &s;een upon the Mount with him, <HI>Luke</HI> ix. 30, 31. is a Confutation of this wild Fancy, even to a Demon|&s;tration.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their <HI>Limbus Infantum</HI> hath no better Ground to &s;upport it, than their <HI>Limbus Patrum,</HI> becau&s;e the Covenant belongs to the Children of Believers though not bapti&s;ed: In which Covenant, Glory and Life eternal are promi&s;ed. Acts ii. 39. <HI>For the Promi&s;e is unto you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call.</HI> Likewi&s;e our compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer declared, that the Kingdom of Heaven belonged to little Children, though not bapti&s;ed. <HI>Mat.</HI> xix. 14. And the Infants of the I&s;raelites dying before the eighth Day, were not &s;hut up in <HI>Limbus Infantum,</HI> as the Adver&s;aries them&s;elves confe&s;s. But the Nature and E&s;&s;ence of Bapti&s;m, under the new Te&s;tament, and the Nature and E&s;&s;ence of Circumci&s;ion under the old, are the &s;ame, according to the Apo&s;tle's Rea&s;oning, <HI>Colo&s;.</HI> ii. 11, 12.</P>

Actions, but every &s;ecret and hidden di&s;hone&s;t Be|haviour. There are tho&s;e, who tho' they make a &s;plendid Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, and behave them&s;elves very &s;peciou&s;ly in their more external Conver&s;ation, yet it were a Shame to &s;peak of the Things that are done of them in Secret; but yet in the Pre&s;ence of God their Judge, who will e're long undoubtedly call them to an Account, to which Period, truly all of us are ha&s;tening. <HI>Man is like to Vanity, his Days are as a Shadow that pa&s;&s;eth away,</HI> P&s;alm cxliv. 5. And therefore Men ought to employ and improve all their Pow|ers, Talents, Time, Means and Sea&s;ons of Grace, all that they have, and all Occa&s;ions for this very great Purpo&s;e, namely, to prepare for Death, and the Judgment that immediately follows after it: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is that Servant, whom his Lord when he cometh &s;hall find &s;o doing,</HI> Mat. xxiv. 46. And the pre&s;ent melancholly Occa&s;ion &s;hould profitably be improved by every one of us; we are not to be Spectators only, but Mourners on many Ac|counts, which I cannot now &s;tand to enumerate. We are to be warned and admoni&s;hed, the poor Criminal in his Chains, is a Monitor to us all. This Hou&s;e of Prayer and Prai&s;e, is now turned in|to an Hou&s;e of Mourning. Ye are anon to be Witne&s;&s;es of a very affecting Tragedy, Death indeed is the End of Men, and who can be &s;o Hardy as not to receive &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ions from the natural &amp; timely Death of others: But more e&s;pecially from the untimely End which &s;ome unhappily bring upon them&s;elves, (as in the Ca&s;e of this unhappy young Man, in his twenty-ninth Year,) who finds by &s;ad Experience that there is no Di&s;charge in that War, and that Wickedne&s;s &s;hall not deliver tho&s;e that are given to it, <HI>Eccl.</HI> viii. 8 Oh, that the Day of

<P>Was the poor Spectacle before us, (I mean the Pri&s;oner) now to &s;peak to you, doubtle&s;s he would addre&s;s you to this Effect: Take Warning by me every one of you, more e&s;pecially young Men: Behold the woful Fruits of bad Cour&s;es, Di&s;obedi|ence to tho&s;e that had the Care of my Education, and perhaps their &s;inful Neglect, Contempt of the Word and Sacraments, and of the Mini&s;try, and Wor&s;hip of God, Profanation of the Lord's Day, taking the Name of the glorious Jehovah often in vain, Idlene&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s, and Rioting, Lying, Stealing, and wa&s;ting of my Neighbour's Goods, who&s;e Good and Quiet, I ought to tender and regard as my own. I have ta&s;ted the Plea&s;ures of Sin, but now I drink deep of the bitter Fruits of it. My Companions in my ill Cour&s;es, have often (at the Co&s;t of our innocent Neighbours) put a Cup of Plea&s;ure, &s;weetned Draughts into my Hand, but mixed with the Poy&s;on of Sin, which now is become a Cup of Shame and Bitterne&s;s unto me. Oh! Pity me, and pity your &s;elves, by guarding betimes again&s;t an ignorant and ill &s;pent Life. And pray earne&s;tly to be protected by divine Mercy from coming to my &s;ad Ca&s;e, and &s;o &s;hameful an End as I have brought my &s;inful Life to. To think that this poor Object &s;uffers only for the Sin of Burglary is impertinent: No, his many other E|normities, were as &s;o many Ingredients in the

Provocation given to a ju&s;t God, to leave him to perpetrate the la&s;t Act upon which his Conviction is grounded, and by which his Mea&s;ure is filled up. May all of you then be careful to &s;hun &s;in|ful and vicious Cour&s;es, which &s;ooner or later will bring Shame, and make &s;o good Improvement of this Occa&s;ion, as to induce you to beg of God dai|ly in the Stile of holy <HI>David,</HI> P&s;alm cxix. 133. <HI>Order my Steps in thy Word, and let not any Iniqui|ty have Dominion over me.</HI></P>
<P>I have already hinted at &s;undry Motives to en|gage Men to &s;tudy to be always in a Readine&s;s to give up their Account unto God, which is to be done by them immediately after Death. As to the Certainty of the Account to be given, it is very exten&s;ive, it will be impartial and critical, it may be very &s;udden and unexpected: Endle&s;s Joy and Comfort &s;hall be to tho&s;e that are found ready, but endle&s;s Sorrow &amp; Mi&s;ery to &s;uch as are found unprepared, and the Sentence that is pa&s;&s;ed upon every Man at Death, will be deci&s;ive and irrevo|cable. Moreover, there are many &s;pecial Advan|tages and Privileges which doth undoubtedly re|dound to tho&s;e that are con&s;tant and faithful in the Pro&s;ecution of this nece&s;&s;ary Work; Glory, Ho|nour and Peace to every Man that worketh good, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 10. The Word Peace, according to the u&s;ual Acceptation of it among&s;t the Hebrews, is comprehen&s;ive of all Good and Happine&s;s, both here and hereafter.

And I &s;olemnly warn all <HI>Young Per&s;ons</HI> that they e&s;pe|cially beware of the foremention'd heinous Sins, and they do not by any Means neglect the Care of their Souls, but &s;ee that they be bu&s;y with God in their Youth, ac|quaint them&s;elves with Chri&s;t and the way to Salvation by Him, accept of Him, and rely upon Him for eternal Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I would earne&s;tly Warn and Charge all <HI>Tavern Keepers</HI> that they mind and give good Weight and Mea&s;ure, there being much Iniquity through the neglect thereof, and &s;ee that they keep good Orders, and do not let Per&s;ons have too much Drink, being that by tho&s;e Means they become in a great Mea&s;ure chargeable with the Sins which others commit when depriv'd of their Sen&s;es thereby. I pray the Tavern Keepers of this Town of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> that they would beware of &s;uffering any Di&s;orders in their Hou&s;es, letting the young Per&s;ons, or the younger or elder Per|&s;ons of the Place continue in their evil Practices of drink|ing to Exce&s;s.</P>
<P>And while I remember what pa&s;s'd with me in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Government, I can't but warn them again&s;t their rudene&s;s, viciou&s;ne&s;s, irreligiou&s;ne&s;s, and breaking the Lord's Day.</P>
<P>Having given this Warning, I de&s;ire to commend my &s;elf to the Charity and Prayers of all God's People for me, and that you would lift up your Hearts to God for me, for the Pardon of my Sins, an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and that I may be &s;anctified by the Spirit of God: But above all I commend my &s;elf to the infinite Mercy of God, in my dear Redeemer, begging and be&s;eeching that through the Merits of his Blood I may this Day be with Him in Paradi&s;e.</P>
