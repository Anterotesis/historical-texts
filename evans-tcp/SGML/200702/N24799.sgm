<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AFRICA, though contiguous to the mo&s;t commercial nations in the world, from whom one would naturally &s;uppo&s;e it might derive &s;ome portion of refinement, is yet involved in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t deplorable barbari&s;m; and its very atmo&s;phere &s;eems fraught with the mo&s;t dete&s;table depravity in human nature. Hence the &s;pirit of di&s;covery will ever be retarded, and travellers will have but little inducement to explore a region where they mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to &s;uch a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of dangers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Since the de&s;truction of Carthage, civilization &s;eems not an attribute of the kingdom of Algiers, or of any of the &s;tates of Barbary; and &s;uch is the virulence of Ma|hometan antipathy to every thing that bears the name of Chri&s;tian, that their contiguous to Europe has perhaps tended to render them even more ferocious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In rendering an account of this famous regency who have &s;o long &s;ignali&s;ed them&s;elves by their villany, the
<PB N="vi" REF="032877_0005_0FF5A7B1742BE560">
author has av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed him&s;elf of the mo&s;t unexceptionable documents that could be procured, and per&s;picuity in&s;tead of elegance and the complete developement of TRUTH have been his primary objects in the compilation of the work.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In its execution he has laboured under &s;everal di&s;|advantages. The fir&s;t &s;heets were put to pre&s;s but a few days after the work was commenced, and before half the materials were collected. Great expedition was therefore indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite, and this circum&s;tance will apologize for inaccuracies or de&s;ultory arrangements.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The work is, however, much more perfect than was originally contemplated. It exhibits a more circum&s;tantial detail of Algerine affairs of a recent date than was ever before publi&s;hed, and will we pre&s;ume afford the Ameri|can reader a tolerable idea of this famous piratical re|gency, to which the United States have lately had the mortification of becoming tributory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It comprehends, be&s;ides an ample account of the late American negociation, a variety of original ob&s;erva|tions upon the government, fortifications, cu&s;toms and man|ners, puni&s;hments, religion, &amp;c. of the Algerines; and for this original matter the public are under con&s;iderable obligations to Mr. ISAAC BROOKS, a gentleman of veracity and intelligence, who was one of the unfor|tunate number who were &s;ubjected to the mi&s;eries of this unparalleled &s;ervitude. The &s;everity of his afflictions
<PB N="vii" REF="032877_0005_0FF5A7B1742BE560">
has reduced him nearly to a &s;tate of blindne&s;s; a misfor|tune which afforded him ample lei&s;ure for rendering a more minute account. In all his communications he has con&s;cientiou&s;ly adhered to the truth, detected mi&s;repre&s;en|tations, and related nothing but what will bear the te&s;t of the &s;tricte&s;t examination.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The &s;ubject is particularly intere&s;ting to the American people, and as the author has recorded events which are recent in the memory of all the captives, he has been &s;cru|pulou&s;ly circum&s;pect in admitting nothing but matters of undi&s;puted authenticity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The la&s;t chapter is an ab&s;tract or compendium of the ad|ventures of Emanuel D'Aranda, "a poor &s;oldier" as he was plea&s;ed to call him&s;elf, probably with a de&s;ign to evade the payment of the exorbitant &s;um demanded for the ran&s;om of all per&s;ons of quality. We find, however, by a Latin eulogium in ver&s;e prefixed to the French edition of his work, that he is called</HI> nobili con&s;ulti&s;&s;imoque Emanueli D'Aranda, I. V. L.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e adventures were written above</HI> 150 <HI>years ago, and are now perhaps unknown in the literary world. In this work there is every appearance of candor, and the concurrence of various circum&s;tances corroborate the pre|&s;umption of its truth.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Phoenicians and Carthagenians the original inhabitants. De&s;truction of Carthage. Expul&s;ion of the Romans by the Vandals. Irruption of the Saracens. Arab princes &s;ubdued.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE is perhaps no problem in hi&s;tory &s;o &s;ingular and unaccountable as the decadence of the power and &s;plendor of the exten&s;ive States of Barbary; which, while Carthage was in the meri|dian of its glory, were the &s;eat of unrivalled great|ne&s;s, and anterior &s;o Rome it&s;elf in arts, in &s;cience, in magnificence and refinement.</P>
<P>The original inhabitants of this country, ac|cording to the mo&s;t authentic hi&s;torians, were the Phoenecians, and after them the Carthagenians, the
<PB N="14" REF="032877_0009_0FF5A7C5D6EF7D90">
formidable rivals of the Romans, and one of the mo&s;t warlike nations of antiquity. The beginning of the Carthagenian hi&s;tory, like that of all other nations, is extremely ob&s;cure and uncertain. In the 7th year of Pygmalion king of Tyre, his &s;i&s;ter Eliza, or Dido, is &s;aid to have fled, with &s;ome of her companions and va&s;&s;als, from the cruelty and avarice of her brother Sichaeus.</P>
<P>She fir&s;t touched at the i&s;land of Cyprus, where &s;he met with a prie&s;t of Jupiter, who was de&s;irous of attending her; to which &s;he con&s;ented. At that time it was a cu&s;tom in the i&s;land of Cyprus, for the young women to go, on certain &s;tated days before marriage, to the &s;ea-&s;ide, and there to look for &s;trangers, that might po&s;&s;ibly arrive on their coa&s;ts, in order to pro&s;titute them&s;elves for gain, that they might thereby acquire a dowry. Out of the&s;e wo|men, the Tyrians &s;elected eighty, whom they car|ried along with them, and then &s;ailed directly for the coa&s;t of Africa: and at la&s;t &s;afely landed in the province called <HI>Africa Propria,</HI> not far from Uti|ca, a Phoenician city of great antiquity. The com|mon fable is, that the Phoenecians impo&s;ed upon the Africans in the following manner: They de&s;ired for their intended &s;ettlement, only as much ground as an ox's hide would encompa&s;s. This reque&s;t the Africans laughed at; but they were &s;urprized when, upon granting it, they &s;aw Eliza cut the hide into the &s;malle&s;t &s;hreds, by which means it &s;ur|rounded a large territory; in which &s;he built the ci|tadel called <HI>Byr&s;a.</HI> The learned, however, ex|plode this fable; but it is certain that the Cartha|genians for many years paid an annual tribute to the Africans for the ground they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>From this period commences the hi&s;tory of the Carthagenians, one of the mo&s;t celebrated nations of
<PB N="15" REF="032877_0009_0FF5A7C5D6EF7D90">
antiquity, who&s;e armies under the command of Hannibal, and other eminent generals, invaded the Roman territory, and threatened the downfal of Rome it&s;elf. But it is not the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent work to enter into a detail of this hi&s;tory, which would form of it&s;elf a large and intere&s;ting volume.</P>
<P>The city of Carthage, by order of the Roman Senate, was plundered and de&s;troyed by the Roman army under AEmilianus. Before he proceeded to execute their order, he performed tho&s;e religious ceremonies which were required on &s;uch occa&s;ions. He fir&s;t &s;acrificed to the gods, and then cau&s;ed a plough to be drawn round the walls of the city. After this, the towers, rampa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, walls, and all the works which the Carthagenians had rai&s;ed in the cour&s;e of many ages, were levelled with the ground. The edifices of this proud metropolis were &s;et on fire, which con&s;umed them all, not a &s;ingle hou&s;e e&s;caping the flames. The &s;ire began in all quarters of the city at the &s;ame time, and continued to burn with incredible fury for the &s;pace of &s;eventeen days, at the end of which time the whole city was reduced to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ell Carthage, about 146 years before the birth of Chri&s;t. The trea&s;ure carried off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y AEmi|lianus, even after it was plundered by the &s;oldiers, according to the computation of Pliny, amounted to 4,470,000 pounds weight of &s;ilver. About twenty-four years after this event C. Gracchus under|took to rebuild it. Maxentius laid it in a&s;hes about the &s;ixth or &s;eventh year of Con&s;tantine's reign, and Gen&s;eric, king of the Vandals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook it in the year 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0 after Chri&s;t; but about a century afterwards it was re-annexed to the Roman empire by the renown|ed Beli&s;arius. At la&s;t the Saracens, under Ma|homet's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, towards the clo&s;e of the &s;eventh
<PB N="16" REF="032877_0010_0FF5A7D5B09B11C8">
century, &s;o completely de&s;troyed it, that there are now &s;carce any ve&s;tiges of it remaining.</P>
<P>After the reduction of the Carthagenian empire, the Romans for a long time maintained their power in Africa. But in the year 426, Bonifacius &s;upreme governor of all the Roman dominions in this quarter, being compelled to revolt by the treachery of another general called Aetius, and finding him&s;elf unable to contend with the whole &s;trength of the Roman empire, invited Gen&s;eric king of the Vandals to his aid; who thereupon abandoned his conque&s;ts in Eu|rope, and pa&s;&s;ed over into Africa. Bonifacius, how|ever, being &s;oon after reconciled to his empre&s;s Pla|cidia, endeavoured in vain to per&s;uade the Vandals to retire. Hereupon a war en&s;ued, in which the barbari|ans proved victorious, and quickly over-ran all the Ro|man provinces in Africa. In the year 435, a peace was concluded; whereby Numidia and &s;ome other coun|tries were ceded to the Vandals, who &s;oon after &s;eized the re&s;t. But the&s;e barbarians did not long enjoy their conque&s;ts: for about the year 535, Beli&s;arus, the Greek emperor Ju&s;tinian's general, drove them out, and annexed the provinces to the ea&s;tern empire.</P>
<P>In the years 647, the Saracens, having conquered Me&s;opotamia, Egypt, Phoenicia, Arabia and Pales|tine, broke like a torrent into Africa, which they quickly &s;ubdued. This la&s;t revolution happened about the middle of the &s;eventh century; and the Arabs continued ma&s;ters of the country till the year 1051. This year, one Abubeker-ben-Omar, or as the Spaniards call him, Abu-Tex|e&s;ien, an Arab of the Zinhagian tribe, being pro|voked at the tyranny of tho&s;e de&s;pots, gathered, by the help of his marabouts or &s;aints, a mo&s;t power|ful army of malcontents, in the &s;outhern provinces of Numidia and Lybia. His followers were nick-named
<PB N="17" REF="032877_0010_0FF5A7D5B09B11C8">
<HI>Marabites</HI> or <HI>Morabites;</HI> by the Spaniards <HI>Almoravides;</HI> probably from their being a&s;&s;embled principally by the &s;aints, who were al&s;o called Mo|rabites. The khalif of Keyem's forces were at this time engaged in quelling other revolts in Syria, Me&s;opotamia, &amp;c. and the Arabs in Spain entered into the mo&s;t bloody wars; &s;o that Texe&s;ien having nothing to fear from them, had all the &s;ucce&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e could wi&s;h again&s;t the Arabian cheyks or petty ty|rants, whom he defeated in many battles, and at la&s;t drove them not only out of Numidia and Ly|bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, but out of all the we&s;tern parts, reducing the whole province of Tingitania under his dominion.</P>
<P>Texe&s;ien was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Yu&s;ef, or Jo|&s;eph, who was a warlike prince. In the beginning of his reign he laid the foundation of the city of Morocco, which he intended as the capital of his empire During the building of this city he &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y of marabouts to Treme&s;en, a province of Algiers, for the purpo&s;e of re&s;toring the Zeneti, a Mahometan &s;ect, to the true faith, as it was called. But the Zeneti contemning all overtures of this na|ture, a&s;&s;embled at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or Amfa their capital, and murdered the amba&s;&s;adors. Not content with this act of outrage and in&s;olence, they invaded Jo|&s;eph's dominions with an army of 50,000 men.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph ju&s;tly exa&s;perated at the&s;e proceedings, levied an army with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, inva|ded their territory, and de&s;troyed all before him with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire and &s;word. The Zeneti in&s;tead of repel|ling the inva&s;ion, retreated towards Fez, where they expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But they were fatally di&s;|appointed in this expectation; for the Fezz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s marched out again&s;t them, and meeting the mi&s;e|rable Zeneti, encumbered with their families and baggage, and ready to expire with hunger and fa|tigue,
<PB N="18" REF="032877_0011_0FF5A7D736EDC868">
fell upon them and cut them all to pieces, except a few who were either drowned in their at|tempts to &s;wim acro&s;s a river, or da&s;hed to pieces from the precipices of rocks to which their enemy had pur&s;ued them.</P>
<P>In the mean time the march of Jo&s;eph's army was marked by havoc and de&s;olation; the territory of the unhappy Zeneti was de&s;olated and reduced to a heap of &s;moking ruins. Their country was, however, &s;oon after re-peopled by numerous immi|grations of Fezzans, who formed colonies under the protection of the reigning princes. According to the mo&s;t authentic accounts it appears, that nearly a millon of men, women and children, of the Zeneti, lo&s;t their lives in this murderous campaign.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph, who was a prince of re&s;tle&s;s ambition, was not long di&s;po&s;ed for peace. He proclaimed war again&s;t the Fezzans whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e rendered tribu|tory, and extended his conque&s;ts along the coa&s;ts of the Mediterranean. His next attack was upon &s;ome Arabian cheyks, whom he pur&s;ued through the Lybian de&s;arts with &s;uch fury, that neither the clifts of the mo&s;t craggy rocks, nor &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es, afforded them &s;helter from the vengeance of their pur&s;uers. He reduced all their ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es, which till then were deemed impregnable, and the extent of his conque&s;ts &s;pread general con&s;ternation and grief through the other nations of Africa.</P>
<P>Thus was the empire of the Morabites founded; but its exi&s;tance was of &s;hort duration; for they were expelled from their new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the 12th century by Mohavedin a marabout. This race of prie&s;ts was &s;ubdued by Abdulac, governor of Fez, who was dive&s;ted in his turn of his new conque&s;ta, in the 13th century, by the Shariffs of Ha&s;cen, who
<PB N="19" REF="032877_0011_0FF5A7D736EDC868">
were the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e Arabian princes whom Abu-Texe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ien had formerly conquered.</P>
<P>The Shariffs divided their new acquired domi|ons into &s;everal petty provinces, and the kingdom of Algiers was divided into Treme&s;en, Tenez, Algiers Proper, and Bujeyah, for their greater &s;ecu|rity again&s;t the inva&s;ions of neighbouring princes. The four fir&s;t monarchs laid &s;o &s;olid a foundation to their empire, by a judicious balance of power, that they continued in mutual peace and harmony for &s;everal &s;ucceeding centuries; but the king of Tre|me&s;en having violated &s;ome articles of their com|pact, Abul-Farez declared war again&s;t him, and re|duced Treme&s;en to a tributory kingdom.</P>
<P>Abul-Farez did not long &s;urvive this event. His kingdom was divided among his three &s;ons, and mu|tual di&s;cord and animo&s;ity was the con&s;equence of this divi&s;ion. Debilitated by the&s;e commotions, they became an ea&s;y conque&s;t to the Spani&s;h govern|ment, who tran&s;ported a powerful fleet and army again&s;t Barbary, under the command of the Count of Navarre, in the year 1505. This commander &s;oon completed the conque&s;t of Oran, Bujeyah, and other important cities; which &s;pread &s;uch an alarm among the Algerines, that they invited the pro|tection of Selim Eutemi, an Arabian prince re|nowned for the prowe&s;s of his arms. He came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance with a large army of his mo&s;t warlike &s;ubjects, attended by Zaphira his queen, and a &s;on about twelve years of age. This force was not, how|ever, &s;ufficient to repel the incur&s;ions of the Spa|niards; they effected the landing of an army the &s;ame year near the city of Algiers, and compelled the me|tropolis to become tributory to Spain. Nor could all the powers of Eutemi prevent the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a formidable Spani&s;h garri&s;on of 200 men on the i&s;land,
<PB N="20" REF="032877_0012_0FF5A7D8C43DF7D0">
in front of the city, which did immen&s;e damage to the cor&s;airs that attempted to &s;ail either in or out of the harbour.</P>
<P>To this galling yoke the Algerines were obliged to &s;ubmit, and they continued tributory till the death of Ferdinand king of Spain, which happened in the year 1516. They were then determined to &s;hake off their Spani&s;h yoke, and in order to effectuate this de&s;ign, they &s;ent an emba&s;&s;ay to Aruch Barbaro&s;&s;a, to &s;olicit his a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Spaniards, and pro|mi&s;ed him an adequate compen&s;ation for his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Barbaro&s;&s;a, &s;o called from the red colour of his beard, was the &s;on of a potter in the i&s;le of Le&s;bos, being prompted by a re&s;tle&s;s and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, he and his brother Hayradin for&s;ook their father, and joined a crew of pirates. In this new profe&s;&s;ion they &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their acti|vity and prowe&s;s; they became ma&s;ters of a &s;mall brigantine, and conducted their piracies with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that they &s;oon a&s;&s;embled a fleet of twelve galleys, be&s;ides many ve&s;&s;els of &s;maller force. Bar|baro&s;&s;a was admiral of this fleet, and Hayradin &s;e|cond in command. Their names &s;oon became terri|ble from the Straits of the Dardanelles to tho&s;e of Gi|braltar. Their ambitious views extended with their power: being no le&s;s dreaded for their valour than their &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, and while acting as cor|&s;airs, they a&s;&s;umed the ideas, and acquired the ta|lents of conquerors. They often carried the prizes they had taken on the coa&s;ts of Spain and Italy, into the ports of Barbary. The convenient &s;itua|tion of the&s;e harbours, lying &s;o near the great com|mercial &s;tates of Chri&s;tendom, prompted them to the de&s;ire of effecting an e&s;tabli&s;hment in the country of Barbary. An opportunity of accompli&s;hing this
<PB N="21" REF="032877_0012_0FF5A7D8C43DF7D0">
project &s;oon pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and they did not &s;uf|fer it to pa&s;s unimproved.</P>
<P>Barbaro&s;&s;a received the Algerine emba&s;&s;y at Hi|gir, about 170 miles to the ea&s;tward of Algiers. He promi&s;ed them every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power, and &s;e|cretly exulted in &s;o favourable an opportunity of ren|dering him&s;elf ma&s;ter of their city. To carry his de|&s;igns into execution, he fitted out a fleet of 18 gal|leys, on board of which was embarked a powerful Turki&s;h army, with a fine train of artillery, and am|ply provided with military &s;tores, and di&s;patched them to the city of Algiers.</P>
<P>Barbaro&s;&s;a in the mean time advanced toward the city by land, with an army of 800 Turks, 3000 Jigelites, and 2000 Moori&s;h volunteers. But in&s;tead of taking the neare&s;t road to Algiers, he directed his cour&s;e towards <HI>Shar&s;hel,</HI> (about 60 miles we&s;t of Algiers), where Ha&s;&s;an, another famous cor&s;air un|der his command, had &s;ettled him&s;elf; and di&s;|patched a me&s;&s;enger to his fleet, which by this time had anchored at Algiers, with orders to repair im|mediately to Shar&s;hel. His de&s;ign by this march was to puni&s;h the treachery of Ha&s;&s;an, who had &s;e|duced a con&s;iderable part of the fleet &s;tationed there into his &s;ervice, and was upon the point of making a de&s;cent upon the Spani&s;h coa&s;t. But he was much a&s;toni&s;hed when he found Barbaro&s;&s;a was &s;o near, and in&s;tantly prepared to oppo&s;e the approach of his army; but di&s;covering the inefficiency of the force he had rai&s;ed, he deemed it mo&s;t prudent to adju&s;t all differences by an amicable compromi&s;e, and af|ter he had received a promi&s;e of pardon from his commander, &s;urrendered him&s;elf a pri&s;oner. Bar|baro&s;&s;a, however, felt little di&s;po&s;ed to pardon the offence, and, by his command, Ha&s;&s;an was execu|ted in the pre&s;ence of the Turki&s;h army.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="032877_0013_0FF5A7DA4C40AC48">
After the&s;e events, he compelled the people of Shar&s;hel to acknowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their &s;overeign, and garri&s;oned a detachment of his army in that place for the &s;ecurity of his conque&s;t. His army and fleet then directed their cour&s;e towards Algiers. On the approach of his army he was met by Selim Eutemi, then regent of Algiers, attended by an immen&s;e concour&s;e of people from the city, who welcomed this celebrated conqueror, whom they deemed in|vincible, with every demon&s;tration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> joy. He was conducted into the city amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, and lodged in one of the noble&s;t apartments of Eutemi's palace, where a mo&s;t &s;ump|tuous banquet was prepared for his entertainment.</P>
<P>Elated beyond mea&s;ure with the great marks o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;|tinction which were conferred upon him, he conceived the de&s;ign of becoming king of Algiers. The day after his arrival he commenced his arrangements for the reduction of the Spaniards, who had been &s;o long obnoxious to the Algerines. He ordered an entrenchment to be formed, and a battery rai&s;ed again&s;t a Spani&s;h fortre&s;s &s;tationed upon a &s;mall i&s;land in the harbour, about 500 yards from the city. Be|fore the commencement of the intended &s;iege of the i&s;land, he di&s;patched a courier to the Spani&s;h garri|&s;on, to inform them, that upon condition they would &s;urrender the fortre&s;s they &s;hould be well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ated and &s;ent to Spain; but if not, they &s;hould all be put to death. The commander of the garri&s;on re|jected all overtures of capitulation, and returned for an&s;wer, that he would hold out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill the very la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t extremity.</P>
<P>Incen&s;ed at this an&s;wer, Barbaro&s;&s;a commenced a bri&s;k cannonade of the i&s;land, which was kept up, with little intermi&s;&s;ion, for twenty days; but his
<PB N="23" REF="032877_0013_0FF5A7DA4C40AC48">
ordnance, con&s;i&s;ting only of &s;mall field pieces, made but little impre&s;&s;ion upon the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the greater part of Barbaro&s;&s;a's army were rioting in every &s;pecies of exce&s;s, and in their intercour&s;e with the citizens, committed every act of violence and atrocity. The Algerines were &s;oon rou&s;ed to a &s;en&s;e of their danger, and Se im Eutemi, greatly exa&s;perated at the outrages of the Turks, entreated Barbaro&s;&s;a to withdraw his army from the city. But his &s;ole view now was the conque&s;t of the city, and the more effectually to accompli&s;h his project, he re&s;olved to murder Eutemi in a private manner, and to proclaim him&s;elf king of Algiers.</P>
<P>In order to execute his de&s;ign, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ole into a &s;mall apartment where Eutemi had one day retired for the purpo&s;e of bathing, and finding the prince alone, he &s;uddenly &s;eized him and &s;trangled him to death. When he had perpetrated this atrocious act, he &s;ecretly withdrew, and left the prince float|ing in the water. Returning &s;hortly after with his attendants, to the bath, he affected great a&s;to|ni&s;hment at the death of Eutemi, who, he alleged, had been drowned in a &s;woon.</P>
<P>His death was, however, generally imputed to the cruelty of Barbaro&s;&s;a, and the citizens, who were panic &s;truck at this event, &s;eemed more anx|ious to &s;creen them&s;elves from oppre&s;&s;ion, than to avenge the death of their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Barbaro&s;&s;a now cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be publicly pro|claimed king; and, as he rode along the &s;treets, his Turks and Moors exclaimed, "Long live king Aruch Barbaro&s;&s;a, the invincible king of Algiers, <HI>the cho&s;en of God</HI> to deliver the people from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tians; and de&s;truction to al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that &s;hall oppo&s;e, or refu&s;e to own him as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lawful &s;overeign." The&s;e la&s;t threatening words
<PB N="24" REF="032877_0014_0FF5A7EC8BE4E430">
&s;o intimidated the inhabitants, already apprehen&s;ive of a general ma&s;&s;acre, that he was immediately ac|knowledged king; and he &s;ummoned all the wealthi|e&s;t part of the citizens before him, to whom he promi&s;ed honors and promotion if they would acquie&s;ce in his &s;overeignty. The unhappy prince&s;s Zaphira made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to &s;tab him with a dagger; but not &s;ucceeding, it is &s;aid &s;he poi&s;oned her&s;elf, to avoid the brutality of her new &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Barbaro&s;&s;a was no &s;ooner &s;eated on the throne, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">an he treated his new &s;ubjects with &s;uch cruelty, that they u&s;ed to &s;hut up their hou&s;es, and hide them&s;elves, when he appeared in public. The Turks finding them&s;elves complete ma&s;ters of the town, indulged them&s;elves in every &s;pecies of vio|lence and rapacity. Their enormities commenced with in&s;ulting language, and the &s;cene terminated in public plunder, murder, and the violation of women.</P>
<P>In this extremity of in&s;ult and mi&s;ery, the citi|zens held a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the gover|nor of the Spani&s;h garri&s;on; in which they inform|ed him that a plot was laid to ma&s;&s;acre the whole Turki&s;h army, &s;olicited his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promi&s;|ed, in con&s;equence, to become again tributory to the king of Spain.</P>
<P>The commander readily acceded to their wi&s;hes, and the following plan was devi&s;ed. A con&s;idera|ble number of Moors, with daggers concealed un|der their clothes, were to enter the city for the purpo&s;e of trading; at the &s;ame time a number of galliots without the town were to be &s;et on fire; and while the Turks were gone to extingui&s;h the flames the gates of the city were to be &s;hut upon them, and the Spaniards to be in&s;tantly landed from the garri&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t the citizens. But the vigilance
<PB N="25" REF="032877_0014_0FF5A7EC8BE4E430">
of Barbaro&s;&s;a di&s;covered the con&s;piracy; in con&s;e|quence of which, he &s;trongly fortified the town, augmented his guards both in the galli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts and at the city-gates, and thus totally fru&s;trated this deep laid &s;cheme.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t tragical events &s;ucceeded this di&s;covery.

An uncommon concour&s;e of people a&s;&s;embled, and a|mong the crowd the tyrant had ordered a number of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urks to be &s;tationed. The moment their re|ligious ceremonies commenced, Barbaro&s;&s;a ordered the doors of the Mo&s;que to be &s;hut, and the whole congregation to be mace pri&s;oners: out of whom he &s;elected twenty of the principal leaders of the faction, whom he conceived to be the mo&s;t obnoxious, and by his orders they were in&s;tantly led into the &s;tee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and there beheaded. After the execution of this atrocious order their bodies were expo&s;ed naked to public view, and their heads rolled about the city for &s;everal days, till at length becoming offen&s;ive, they were buried in a dunghill. This event took place in the year 1517.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things where tran&s;acting Selim Eute|mi's &s;on, apprehen&s;ive of danger, fled to Oran, where he put him&s;elf under the protection of the marquis of Gomarez, general of that place, and laid before that nobleman a plan for putting the city of Algiers into the hands of the king of Spain. Gomarez approv|ed of the plan, and &s;ent young Selim Eutemi to Spain, where he laid his &s;cheme before Cardinal Franci&s;co Ximenes and the councils of Spain, who likewi&s;e ap|proved of it, and &s;ent a fleet with 10,000 land forces,

under the command of young Selim and Don Dieg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Vera, to re&s;tore the young prince to his kingdom. But deplorable was the fate of this army; for they were no &s;ooner come within &s;ight of land, than a tempe&s;t aro&s;e, which raged with &s;uch violence that the whole fleet was involved in de&s;truction; many ve&s;&s;els ran foul of each other; &s;ome were &s;wallowed up by the ocean, and others da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the rocks.

<P>The pride of Barbaro&s;&s;a was greatly elated at this di&s;a&s;ter, and though he had nothing to boa&s;t on this occa&s;ion, yet his vanity and in&s;olence were now &s;welled to &s;uch a degree, that he imagined him&s;elf invincible, and fancied that the very elements had con&s;pired to render him &s;o. By this misfortune all hopes were lo&s;t of expelling Barbaro&s;&s;a, and re|&s;toring the heirs of Selim to the regency of Algiers.</P>
<P>Barbaro&s;&s;a's tyranny became at length &s;o in&s;up|portable, that the Arabians, who inhabited the low|er parts of the country, implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Hamidel Abdes king of Tenez to drive the Turks out of Algiers. That prince undertook to grant them all the aid in his power, upon condition that the Arabians would agree to &s;ettle the kingdom on him&s;elf and his de&s;cendants.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was readily accepted, and Hami|del Abdes immediately &s;et out at the head of an ar|my of 10,000 Moors. He began his march in June 1517, and, upon his entering the Algerine domi|nions, was joined by all the Arabians in the coun|try, who openly avowed them&s;elves the enemies of the tyrant. Barbaro&s;&s;a, gaining intelligence of the
<PB N="27" REF="032877_0015_0FF5A7EE143CB1D0">
approach of Hamidel Abdes, rai&s;ed an army of 1000 Turki&s;h mu&s;queteers, and 500 Granada Moors, and con&s;igning the government of Algiers to the care of his brother Hayradin, came out with this incon&s;iderable force to meet Hamidel Ab|des. After a march of about twelve leagues to the we&s;tward of Algiers, Barbaro&s;&s;a came up with him, and a de&s;perate engagement commen|ced. Victory was for &s;ome time d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bious, and the mo&s;t horrible carnage en&s;ued. But the Turks, be|ing di&s;ciplined to the u&s;e of fire arms, di&s;played great &s;uperiority, and the enemy having only ar|rows and javelins, began to give way. Their nu|merous army was totally defeated, and Barbaro&s;&s;a pur&s;ued them to the gates of their capital; of which he ea&s;ily made him&s;elf ma&s;ter. Hamidel Abdes &s;till retreated towards mount Atlas, and the unfortunate city, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, fell a victim to every &s;pecies of violence and brutality, and Barbaro&s;&s;a was proclaimed king.</P>
<P>The fame of this deci&s;ive victory was &s;oon &s;pread over all Africa, and no &s;ooner had Barbaro&s;&s;a be|come ma&s;ter of Tenez, than he received an emba&s;&s;y from the inhabitants of Treme&s;en, (about 50 leagues we&s;tward), who were di&s;&s;atisfied with the admini&s;tra|tion of their king, principally on account of his having dethroned his nephew; whom he obliged to fly to Oran; and they offered to inve&s;t Barbaro&s;&s;a even with the &s;overeignty, in ca&s;e he accepted their propo&s;al. An application of this nature, as may well be imagined, was highly plea&s;ing to him, and he was determined not to lo&s;e &s;o favourable an op|portunity of extending his conque&s;ts. In con&s;e|quence of this emba&s;&s;ay he wrote to his brother Hayradin to &s;end him forward &s;ome pieces of ar|tillery and military &s;tores; and upon the receipt

<P>The king of Treme&s;en, not &s;u&s;pecting the treachery of his &s;ubjects, rai&s;ed an army of 6000 hor&s;e and 3000 foot, and met the tyrant in the plains of Aganel in advance of the city, where a bloody action took place; in which the king, unable to &s;tand before Barbaro&s;&s;a's artillery, was totally routed, and fled with the remains of his army to the capital, where he was taken pri&s;oner and behe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ded by his &s;ubjects.

Su&s;picious of oppo&s;ition to his admini&s;tration in the government of Treme&s;en, and apprehen&s;ive of a precarious reign in con&s;equence of his enormities, he entered into an alliance with Muley Hamet king of Fez, each &s;tipulating to render each other mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t their enemies. After which he took care, for the purpo&s;e of greater &s;ecurity, to garri&s;on Treme&s;en with troops, as well as the re&s;t of the cities in his kingdom. &s;ome of the&s;e, however, &s;oon after revolted; upon which he &s;ent one of his cor&s;airs, named E&s;cander, no le&s;s ferocious than him|&s;elf, to reduce them.

revolt among the Moors of the country, and he fell a victim to their fury.</P>
<P>The Treme&s;enians &s;oon repented &s;incerely that they had courted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a tyrant; and held con&s;ultations on the mo&s;t effectual means of expelling him from their city, and re&s;toring Abu|chen Men, their lawful prince. But their cabals were &s;oon di&s;covered, and a great number of the con&s;pi|rators were ma&s;&s;acred in the mo&s;t cruel manner.</P>
<P>Abuchen Men, who had fortunately e&s;caped to Oran, was taken under the protection of the mar|quis of Gomarez, who &s;ent immediate advice of it to Charles V. then lately arrived in Spain, with a powerful fleet and army, and gave him a particular account of the tran&s;actions that had taken place in Africa. Charles immediately ordered an army of 10,000 men to be rai&s;ed and put under the command of Gomarez, and the guidance of Abuchen Men; who began their march towards Treme&s;en; and in their way were joined by prince Selim with a great num|ber of Arabs and Moors. Their fir&s;t re&s;olve was to attack the important fortre&s;s of Cala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ituated be|tween Treme&s;en and Algiers, and commanded by the cor&s;air E&s;cander, at the head of about 300 Turks. They inve&s;ted it clo&s;ely on all &s;ides, with a de&s;ign to decoy Barbaro&s;&s;a from Treme&s;en to its re|lief, and to afford the Treme&s;enians an opportunity of &s;hutting their gates again&s;t him. But the tyrant kept clo&s;e lodged in his capital, embarra&s;&s;ed by the fears of a general revolt, and the dangerous delays of the king of Fez, who had neglected to &s;end for|ward the auxiliaries he had promi&s;ed. The garri&s;on of Calau in the mean time made a vigorous defence, and in a fortie they made in the night killed 300 Spaniards. This encouraged them to make a &s;econd &s;ally; but they were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s, and
<PB N="30" REF="032877_0017_0FF5A7F128A92A18">
E&s;cander him&s;elf was wounded. The garri&s;on un|able to hold out any longer, capitulated upon honor|able terms; but they were all ma&s;&s;acred by the Arabians except &s;ixteen, who clung clo&s;e to the &s;tirrups of the king and the Spani&s;h general.</P>
<P>After the reduction of this fortre&s;s they began their march to lay &s;iege to Treme&s;en. Barbaro&s;&s;a receiving intelligence of their approach, was deter|mined to wait no longer for reinforcements from the king of Fez, and came out of his capital with a troop of 1500 Turks and 5000 Moori&s;h hor&s;e, to op|po&s;e the progre&s;s of the Spaniards. But gaining in|telligence of the &s;uperiority of their force, his coun|cils advi&s;ed him to return and fortify him&s;elf in his capital. This advice however came too late. The inhabitants of Treme&s;en had &s;hut their gates again&s;t him, and were re&s;olved to open them only to their lawful &s;overeign, when he appeared. In this extrem|ity he deemed it mo&s;t prudent to retire to the citadel, and defend him&s;elf there till he could find an oppor|tunity of &s;tealing away with his men and trea&s;ure. Here he made a vigorous defence, but his pro|vi&s;ions failing, he effected his e&s;cape by night through a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, which he had cau&s;ed to be dug for that purpo&s;e, and carried off all his immen&s;e trea&s;ures with him. But his flight was &s;oon di&s;covered, and Gomarez ordered an im|mediate pur&s;uit. Barbaro&s;&s;a finding him&s;elf &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, cau&s;ed a con&s;iderable quantity of money, plate, jewels, &amp;c. to be &s;cattered along the rout he had taken, in order to amu&s;e the enemy, and to retard their pur&s;uit in gathering it up, while he effected the pa&s;&s;age of the river Fluexda, But this &s;tratagem, through the vigilance of the Spani&s;h commander, did not &s;ucceed; for Gomarez, order|ed his men to march on, without waiting to gather

up the &s;poils, and they &s;oon overtook the fugitive on the banks of the river, about eight leagues from Treme&s;en. Barbaro&s;&s;a had ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ed the river with his vanguard; and the Spani&s;h army furiou&s;ly attacked his rear on the other &s;ide, and cut them all to pieces. Gomarez then cro&s;&s;ed the river, and a bloody engagement en&s;ued, in which his Turks fought with the greate&s;t fury. But being overpow|ered by numbers, the tyrant fell, and 1500 Turks were left dead upon the field of battle.</P>
<P>Thus terminated the career of this powerful ty|rant, who died in the year 1519, in the 44th year of his age; four years after he had a&s;pired to the royal title of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">igel</HI> of the adjacent country; two years after he had a&s;&s;umed the &s;overeignty of Al|giers; a twelvemonth after the reduction of Tre|me&s;en; and after he had infe&s;ted the &s;eas and &s;pread havoc and de&s;olation through the country of Barbary for the &s;pace of fourteen years.</P>
<P>After this important victory Gomarez returned in triumph to Treme&s;en, amid&s;t the &s;houts of the multitude, who came out to meet him, with the head of Barbaro&s;&s;a carried upon the point of a &s;pear; and Abuchen Men was proclaimed king, to the great joy of all the inhabitants.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE news of Barbaro&s;&s;a's death &s;pread the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation among the Turks at Algiers; and his brother Hayradin was immediately proclaimed king. The Spani&s;h commander very imprudently neglected to follow up his victories at this au&s;picious juncture, and &s;ent back the emperor's forces without attempting the reduction of Algiers. Hayradin in his pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation, apprehen&s;ive of a Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, and dreading the con&s;equences of his tyrany and that of his officers, &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to &s;olicit the protection of the Grand Signior; which was rea|dily granted. He was appointed Ba&s;haw or Viceroy of Algiers, and received &s;uch con&s;iderable rein|forcements
<PB N="33" REF="032877_0018_0FF5A800957CF010">
as completely effected the &s;ubjugation of the unhappy Algerines, who d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t not make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance or complaint. In con&s;equence of the&s;e reinforcements, his armies were further aug|mented by &s;uch numbers of Turks that continually re&s;orted to him, that he was enabled not only to keep the Moors and Arabs in &s;ubjection at home, but to annoy the Chri&s;tians at &s;ea.</P>
<P>His next &s;tep was the reduction of the Spani&s;h fortre&s;s in front of the city, which was a great nui&s;|ance to the metropolis, and of which the Spaniards held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">30. His galleys were, in con&s;equence, always obliged to anchor near the gate of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">baz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, out of the reach of their cannon, where they were continually expo&s;ed to the danger of tempe&s;ts. He was therefore deter|mined to reduce it, and his fir&s;t attempt was by &s;tra|tagem. Having made choice of two Moo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h lads, and given them in&s;tructions how to act, he &s;ent them to the fort, where they reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to enter, declaring that they were de&s;irous of em|bracing the Chri&s;tian religion, and re&s;iding with the Spaniards. The lads were received and treat|ed with great kindne&s;s: and one Ea&s;ter Sunday, while Martin de Vargas, the commander, and his men were at church, the&s;e lads a&s;cended a tower that commanded a pro&s;pect of the city, from whence they waved a flag, as a &s;ignal, that the Spaniards were off their guard. The flag being ob&s;erved by the commander's &s;ervant maid, &s;he ran immediately and acquainted her ma&s;ter with the circum&s;tance. Vargas and his men repaired to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r in&s;tantly, where they &s;eized the lads, and prepared to oppo&s;e the landing of the enemy. Hayradin finding his plan had mi&s;carried, de&s;i&s;ted from his de&s;ign; and when the alarm had &s;ub&s;ided, the two lads were
<PB N="34" REF="032877_0019_0FF5A8021D6E4958">
brought out, and at the command of Vargas, were both hanged upon an eminence in &s;ight of the city. Hayradin was greatly exa&s;perated at the &s;ight, and was re&s;olved upon the immediate reduction of the fort. Whereupon he di&s;patched a renegado to the fort to acquaint Vargas, that if he would deliver up the garri&s;on, he and his men &s;hould be well treated, and &s;ent to Spain; but if not, they &s;hould all be put to death. Vargas returned for an&s;wer, that he would hold out to the la&s;t extremity. Haraydin up|on the receipt of this an&s;wer, rai&s;ed a formidable battery, and commenced a vigorous cannonade upon the i&s;land, which continued for fifteen days and nights without intermi&s;&s;ion; at the end of which time almo&s;t all the walls of the garri&s;on were bat|tered down, and the greate&s;t part of the be&s;ieged were killed. Hayradin now ordered a de&s;cent to be made upon the i&s;land, which was effected with|out oppo&s;ition, and the whole garri&s;on were made pri&s;oners. Vargas &s;uffered impri&s;onment for about three months, at the end of which time he was or|dered into the pre&s;ence of Hayradin, and ba&s;tina|doed to death.</P>
<P>After this event he &s;et about building a &s;trong mole from the i&s;land to the city, for the protection of his &s;hips, and in this he employed 30,000 Chri&s;|tian &s;laves, who were engaged in this work for three years without intermi&s;&s;ion, in which time the work was completed. He then cau&s;ed the fort ta|ken from the Spaniards to be repaired, and placed a &s;trong garri&s;on in it to prevent foreign ve&s;&s;els from entering the harbour without giving an ac|count of them&s;elves. By the&s;e two important works, Hayradin &s;oon became dreaded not only by the Arabs and Moors, but al&s;o by the maritime
<PB N="35" REF="032877_0019_0FF5A8021D6E4958">
Chri&s;tian powers, e&s;pecially the Spaniards. The viceroy failed not to acquaint the Grand Signior with his &s;ucce&s;s, and obtained from him a fre&s;h &s;upply of money, by which he was enabled to build a &s;tronger fort, and to erect batteries on all places that might favour the landing of the enemy. All the&s;e have &s;ince received greater improvements from time to time, as often as there was occa&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Sultan, either out of a &s;en&s;e of the great &s;ervices Hayradin had done, or per|haps out of jealou&s;y le&s;t he &s;hould make him&s;elf independent, rai&s;ed Hayradin to the dignity of ba&s;haw of the empire, and appointed Ha&s;tan Aga, a Sardinian renegado, an intrepid warrior, and an experienced officer, to &s;ucceed him as ba&s;haw of Algiers. Ha&s;&s;an had no &s;ooner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new government, than he began to pur|&s;ue his ravages on the Spani&s;h coa&s;t with greater fury than ever; extending them to the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal &s;tates, and other parts of Italy. But Pope Paul III. being alarmed at this, exhorted the emperor Charles V. to &s;end a powerful fleet to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e frequent and cruel piracies; and, that no|thing might be wanting to render the enterpri&s;e &s;ucce&s;sful, a bull was publi&s;hed by his holine&s;s, wherein a plenary ab&s;olution of &s;ins, and the crown of martyrdom, were promi&s;ed to all tho&s;e who either fell in battle, or were made &s;laves. The emperor on his part needed no &s;pur; and therefore &s;et &s;ail at the head of a powerful fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of 120 &s;hips and 20 galleys, having on board 30,000 cho&s;en troops, an immen&s;e quantity of money, arms, amunition, &amp;c. In this expedition ma|ny young nobility and gentry attended as volunteers, and among the&s;e many knights of Malta, &s;o remark|able
<PB N="36" REF="032877_0020_0FF5A803A6F075C8">
for their valour again&s;t the enemies of Chri&s;|tianity. Even ladies of birth and character attended Charles in his expedition, and the wives and daughters of the officers and &s;oldiers followed them with a de&s;ign to &s;ettle in Barbary after the conque&s;t was completed. All the&s;e meeting with a favour|able wind, &s;oon appeared before Algiers: every &s;hip di&s;playing the Spani&s;h colours on the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rn, and another at the head, with a crucifix to &s;erve them for a pilot.</P>
<P>By this prodigious armament the Algerines were thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. The city was &s;urrounded only by a wall with &s;carce any out|works. The whole garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of 800 Turks and 6000 Moors, without fire-arms, and poorly di&s;ciplined and acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tred; the re&s;t of their forces being di&s;per&s;ed in the other provinces of the king|dom to levy the u&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> tribute on the Arabs and Moors. The Spaniards landed without oppo&s;ition, and immediately built a fort, under the cannon of which they encamped, and diverted the cour&s;e of a &s;pring which &s;upplied the city with water. Being now reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, Ha&s;&s;an receiv|ed a &s;ummons to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, on pain of being put to the &s;word with all the garri&s;on. The herald was ordered to extol the va&s;t power of the emperor both by &s;ea and land, and to exhort him to return to the Chri&s;tian religion. But to this Ha&s;&s;an only replied, that he mu&s;t be a mad|man that would pretend to advi&s;e an enemy, and that the advi&s;ed mu&s;t &s;till act more madly who would take coun&s;el of &s;uch an advi&s;or. He was, however, on the point of &s;urrendering the city, when advice was brought him, that the forces be|longing to the we&s;tern government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was re|&s;olved
<PB N="37" REF="032877_0020_0FF5A803A6F075C8">
to defend it to the utmo&s;t. Charles, in the mean time, re&s;olving upon a general a&s;&s;ault, kept a con&s;tant firing upon the town; which, from the weak defence made by the garri&s;on, he looked up|on as already in his hands. But while the <HI>divan,</HI> or Algerine &s;enate, were deliberating upon the mo&s;t proper means of obtaining an honorable capi|tulation, a mad prophet, attended by a multitude of people, entered the a&s;&s;embly, and foretold the &s;peedy de&s;truction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhorting the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was &s;oon verified in a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing and unexpected manner: for, on the 28th of October 1541, a dreadful &s;torm of wind, rain, and hail, aro&s;e from the north, ac|companied with violent &s;hocks of earthquakes, and a di&s;mal univer&s;al darkne&s;s both by &s;ea and land; &s;o that the &s;un, moon and elements &s;eemed to com|bine together for the de&s;truction of the Spaniards. In one night, &s;ome &s;ay in le&s;s than half an hour, 86 &s;hips and 15 galleys were de&s;troyed, with all their crews and military &s;tores; by which the ar|my or &s;hore was deprived of all means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. Their camp al&s;o, which &s;pread it&s;elf along the plain under the fort, was laid quite under wa|ter by the torrents which de&s;cended from the neigh|bouring hills. Many of the troops, by trying to remove into &s;ome better &s;ituation, were cut in pie|ces by the Moors and Arabs; while &s;everal gal|leys, and other ve&s;&s;els, endeavouring to gain &s;ome neighbouring creek along the coa&s;ts, were immedi|ately plundered, and their crews ma&s;&s;acred by the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The next morning Charles beheld the &s;ea co|vered with the fragments of &s;hips, and the bodies of men, hor&s;es and other creatures &s;wimming on
<PB N="38" REF="032877_0021_0FF5A8052F6024B0">
the waves; at which he was &s;o di&s;heartened that he abandoned his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, to the enemy, and marched at the head of his army, though in no &s;mall di&s;order, towards cape <HI>Malabux,</HI> in order to reimbark in tho&s;e ve&s;|&s;els which had weathered out the &s;torm. But Ha&s;|&s;an, who had watched his motions, allowed him ju&s;t time enough to get to the &s;hore, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he &s;al|lied out and attacked the Spaniards in the mid&s;t of their hurry and confu&s;ion to get into their &s;hips, killing great numbers, and bringing away a &s;till greater number of captives; after which he return|ed in triumph to Algiers, where he celebrated, with great rejoicings, his happy deliverance from &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s and danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the old Engli&s;h hi&s;torians inform us, that this de&s;truction of the Spaniards was occa&s;ioned by <HI>witch-craft&punc;</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Soon after this the prophet <HI>Yu&s;ef,</HI> who had fore|told the de&s;truction of the Spaniards, was not only declared the deliverer of his country, but had a con&s;iderable gratuity decreed him, with the liber|ty of exerci&s;ing his prophetic function unmole&s;ted. It was not long, however, before the marabouts, and &s;ome interpreters of the law, made a &s;trong oppo|&s;ition again&s;t him; remon&s;trating to the ba&s;haw, how ridiculous and &s;candalous it was to the nation, to a&s;cribe their deliverance to a poor fortune-teller, which had been obtained by the fervent prayers of a &s;aint of their own profe&s;&s;ion. But though the ba&s;haw and his divan &s;eemed, out of policy, to give into this la&s;t notion, yet the impre&s;&s;ion which Yu&s;ef's predictions, and their late accompli&s;hments, had made upon the minds of the common people, proved too &s;trong to be eradicated; and the &s;pirit of divination and conjuring has &s;ince got into &s;uch credit among them, that not only their great &s;tates|men,
<PB N="39" REF="032877_0021_0FF5A8052F60024B0">
but their prie&s;ts, marabouts, and &s;antoons, have applied them&s;elves to that &s;tudy, and digni|fied it with the name of <HI>Mahomet's Revelations.</HI></P>
<P>The unhappy Spaniards had &s;carce reached their &s;hips, when they were attacked by a fre&s;h &s;torm, in which &s;everal more of them peri&s;hed; one &s;hip in particular, containing 700 &s;oldiers, be&s;ides &s;ailors, &s;unk in the emperor's &s;ight, without a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;aving a &s;ingle man. At length, with much labour, they reached the port of <HI>Bujeyah,</HI> at that time po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards, whither Ha&s;&s;an king of Tunis &s;oon after repaired, with a &s;upply of provi|&s;ions for the emperor, who received him graciou&s;ly, with fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of his favour and protection. Here he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the few remains of the Malte&s;e knights and their forces, who embarked in three &s;hattered galleys, and with much difficulty and danger reached their own country. Charles him&s;elf &s;taid no longer than till the 16th of November, when he &s;ailed for Carthagena, and reached it on the 25th of the &s;ame month. In this unfortunate ex|pedition upwards of 120 &s;hips and galleys were lo&s;t, above 300 colonels and other land and &s;ea officers, 8000 &s;oldiers and mariners, be&s;ides tho&s;e de&s;troyed by the enemy on the reimbarkation, or drowned in the la&s;t &s;torm. The number of pri&s;oners was &s;o great, that the Algerines &s;old &s;ome of them, by way of contempt, for an onion per head.</P>
<P>Ha&s;&s;an, elated with this victory, in which he had very little &s;hare, undertook an expedition a|gain&s;t the king of Treme&s;en, who, being now de|prived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spaniards, was for|ced to procure a peace by paying a va&s;t &s;um of money, and becoming tributory to him. The ba&s;haw returned to Algiers, laden with riches; and &s;oon after died of a fever, in the 66th year of his age.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="032877_0022_0FF5A816C857C5D0">
From this time the Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines in any con&s;iderable degree. In 1555, they lo&s;t the city of Bujeyah, which was taken by Salha Rais, Ha&s;&s;an's &s;ucce&s;&s;or; who next year &s;et out on a new expedition, which he kept a &s;ecret, but was &s;u&s;pected to be intended again&s;t Oran: but he was &s;carcely got four leagues from Algiers, when the plague, which at that time ra|ged violently in the city, broke out in his groin, and carried him off in 24 hours.</P>
<P>Immediately after his death the Algerine &s;ol|diery cho&s;e a Cor&s;ican renegado, Ha&s;&s;an Cor&s;o, in his room, till they &s;hould receive further orders from the Porte. He did not accept the ba&s;haw&s;hip without a good deal of difficulty; but immediately pro&s;ecuted the intended expedition to Oran, di&s;|patching a me&s;&s;enger to acquaint the Porte with what had happened. They had hardly begun their ho&s;tilities again&s;t the place, when orders came from the Porte, expre&s;sly forbidding Ha&s;&s;an Cor&s;o to begin the &s;iege, or, if he had begun it, enjoining him to rai&s;e it immediately. This news was receiv|ed with great grief by the whole fleet and army, as they thought them&s;elves &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, the garri&s;on being at that time very weak. Neverthe|le&s;s, as they dared not di&s;obey, the &s;iege was im|mediately rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Cor&s;o had hardly enjoyed the dignity four months, before news came, that eight galleys were bringing a new ba&s;haw to &s;ucceed him; one Tekel|li, a principal Turk of the Grand Signior's court; upon which the Algerines unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved not to admit him. By the treachery of the Levantine &s;oldiers, however, he was admitted at la&s;t, and the unfortunate Cor&s;o was thrown over a wall, in which a number of iron hooks were fixed; one of which
<PB N="41" REF="032877_0022_0FF5A816C857C5D0">
caught the ribs of his right &s;ide, and he hung three days in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torture before he expired.</P>
<P>Tekelli was no &s;ooner entered upon his new government, than he behaved with &s;uch cruelty, that he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, even under the dome of a &s;aint, by Yu&s;ef Calabres, the favorite renegado of Ha&s;&s;an Cor&s;o; who for this &s;ervice was unani|mou&s;ly cho&s;en ba&s;haw, but died of the plague &s;ix days after his election.</P>
<P>Yu&s;ef was &s;ucceeded by Ha&s;&s;an the &s;on of Hay|radin, who had been formerly recalled from his ba&s;haw&s;hip, when he was &s;ucceeded by Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ha Rais; and now had got the good fortune to get him&s;elf rein&s;tated in his employment. Immediately on his arrival, he engaged in a war with the Arabs, by whom he was defeated with great lo&s;s. The next year, the Spaniards undertook an expedition again&s;t Mo&s;tagan, under the command of the count d'Al|candela; but were utterly defeated, the comman|der him&s;elf killed, and 12,000 taken pri&s;oners. This di&s;a&s;ter was owing to the incon&s;iderate ra&s;h|ne&s;s, or rather madne&s;s, of the commander; which was &s;o great, that after finding it impo&s;&s;ible to rally his &s;cattered forces, he ru&s;hed, &s;word in hand, into the thicke&s;t of the enemy's ranks, at the head of a &s;mall number of men, crying out, <HI>"St. Jago! St. Jago! the victory is ours, the enemy is defeated;"</HI> &s;oon after which he was thrown from his hor&s;e, and trampled to death.</P>
<P>Ha&s;&s;an having had the misfortune to di&s;plea&s;e his &s;ubjects, by allowing the mountaineers of Cuco to buy ammunition at Algiers, was &s;ent in irons to Con&s;tantinople, while the aga of the Jani&s;aries, and general of the land forces, &s;upplied his place. Ha&s;&s;an ea&s;ily found means to clear him&s;elf; but a new ba&s;haw was appointed, called Achmet; who
<PB N="42" REF="032877_0023_0FF5A81866D46E00">
was no &s;ooner arrived, than he &s;ent the two deputy-ba&s;haws to Con&s;tantinople, where their heads were &s;truck off. Achmet was a man of &s;uch in&s;atiable avarice, that upon his arrival at Algiers, all ranks of people came in &s;hoals to make him pre&s;ents; which he the more greedily accepted, as he had bought his dignity by the money he had ama&s;&s;ed while head gardener to the Sultan. He enjoyed it, however, only four months; and after his death, the &s;tate was governed other four months by his lieu|tenant; when Ha&s;&s;an was a third time &s;ent viceroy to Algiers, where he was received with the greate&s;t demon&s;trations of joy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t enterpri&s;e in which Ha&s;&s;an engaged, was the &s;iege of Mar&s;alquiver, &s;ituated near the ci|ty of Oran, which he de&s;igned to inve&s;t immedi|ately after. The army employed in this &s;iege con|&s;i&s;ted of 26,000 foot and 10,000 hor&s;e, be&s;ides which he had a fleet con&s;i&s;ting of 32 galleys and galliots, together with three French ve&s;&s;els laden with bi&s;cuit, oil, and other provi&s;ions. The city was defended by Don Martin de Cordova, brother of the count d'Alcandela, who had been taken pri|&s;oner in the battle where that nobleman was killed, but had obtained his liberty from the Algerines with immen&s;e &s;ums, and now made a mo&s;t gallant defence again&s;t the Turks. The city was attacked with the utmo&s;t fury by &s;ea and land, and &s;everal breaches were made in the walls. The Turki&s;h &s;tandards were &s;everal times planted on the walls, and as often di&s;lodged; but the place mu&s;t in the end have &s;ubmitted, had not Ha&s;&s;an been obli|ged to rai&s;e the &s;iege in ha&s;te, on the news that the famous Genoe&s;e admiral Doria was approaching with con&s;iderable &s;uccours from Italy. The fleet accordingly arrived &s;oon after; but mi&s;&s;ing the Al|gerine

galleys, bore away for Pennon de Velez, where they were &s;hamefully repul&s;ed by a handful of Turks who garri&s;oned that place; which, how|ever, was taken the following year.</P>
<P>In 1567, Ha&s;&s;an was again recalled to Con&s;tan|tinople, where he died three years after. He was &s;ucceeded by Mahomet, who gained the love of the Algerines by &s;everal public &s;pirited actions. He incorporated the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ani&s;aries and Levantine Turks together, and by that means put an end to their di&s;&s;entions, which laid the foundation of the Algerine independency on the Porte. He likewi&s;e added &s;ome con&s;iderable fortifications to the city and ca&s;tle, which he de&s;igned to render impregnable.</P>
<P>But while he was thus &s;tudying the intere&s;t of Al|giers, one John Ga&s;con, a bold Spani&s;h adventurer, formed a de&s;ign of &s;urpri&s;ing the whole piratic navy in the bay, and &s;etting them on fire in the night time, when they lay defencele&s;s, and in their fir&s;t &s;leep. For this he had not only the permi&s;&s;ion of king Philip II. but was furni&s;hed by him with pro|per ve&s;&s;els, mariners, and fire-works, for the exe|cution of his plot. With the&s;e he &s;et &s;ail for Al|giers in the beginning of October, the mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;on, when mo&s;t, if not all the &s;hips lay at an|chor there, and ea&s;ily &s;ailed near enough, un&s;u&s;|pected, to view their manner of riding, in order to &s;urpri&s;e them at a time when the greater part of their crews were di&s;per&s;ed in their quarters. He came accordingly, unperceived by any, to the very mole-gate, and di&s;per&s;ed his men with their fire-works; but to their great &s;urpri&s;e, they found them &s;o ill mixed, that they could not with all their art make them take fire. In the mean time, Ga&s;con took it into his head, by way of bravado, to go to the mole-gate, and give three loud knocks at it with
<PB N="44" REF="032877_0024_0FF5A819ED776F50">
the pommel of his dagger, and to leave it fixed in the gate by its point, that the Algerines might have cau&s;e to remember him. This he had the good fortune to do without meeting any di&s;turbance or op|po&s;ition; but it was not &s;o with his men; for no &s;ooner did they find their endeavours fru&s;trated, than they made &s;uch a bu&s;tle as quickly alarmed the guard po&s;ted on the adjacent ba&s;tion, from which the uproar quickly &s;pread it&s;elf through the whole garri&s;on. Ga&s;con now finding him&s;elf in the utmo&s;t danger, &s;ailed away with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te; but was pur&s;ued, overtaken, and brought back a pri&s;oner to Mahomet; who no &s;ooner got him into his power, than he immediately cau&s;ed a gibbet of con&s;iderable height to be erected on the &s;pot where Ga&s;con had landed, ordering him to be hoi&s;ted up, and hung by the feet to a hook, that he might die in extreme tor|ture; and to &s;how his re&s;entment and contempt of the king his ma&s;ter, he ordered his commi&s;&s;ion to be tied to his toes. He had not, however, hung long in that &s;tate, when the captain who took him, accom|panied by a number of other cor&s;airs, interceded &s;o &s;trongly in his behalf, that he was taken down, and put under the care of a Chri&s;tian &s;urgeon; but two days after, &s;ome Moors reporting that it was the common talk and belief in Spain, that the Algerines dur&s;t not hurt a hair of Ga&s;con's head, the unfortunate Spaniard was hoi&s;ted up by a pully to the top of the execution-wall, and from thence thrown down up|on hooks which were fa&s;tened in it, one of which caught him by the ribs as he fell, and gave him &s;uch a wound that he expired without a groan.&mdash;Thus ended the expedition of John Ga&s;con, which has procured him a place among the Spani&s;h martyrs; while on the other hand, the Algerines look upon his di&s;appointment to have been miraculous, and

<P>The kingdom of Algiers continued to be go|verned till the beginning of the &s;eventeenth centu|ry, by viceroys, or ba&s;haws appointed by the Porte; concerning whom we find nothing very remarkable, further than that their avarice and tyranny was intolerable both to the Algerines and the Turks them&s;elves.

On their part, they engaged al|ways to acknowledge the Grand Signiors as their &s;overeigns, and to pay them their u&s;ual allegiance and tribute, to re&s;pect their ba&s;haws, and even to lodge and maintain them and their retinue, in a manner &s;uitable to their dignity, at their own charge. The ba&s;haws, however, were for the fu|ture, to be excluded from a&s;&s;i&s;ting at any but gene|ral divans, unle&s;s invited to it; and from having the liberty of voting in them, unle&s;s when their ad|vice was a&s;ked, or the intere&s;t of the Porte was likely to &s;uffer by their &s;ilence. All other con|cerns, which related to the government of Algiers, were to be wholly left under the direction of the dey and his divan.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;als having been accepted by the Porte, the deputies returned highly &s;atisfied; and having notified their new privileges, the great di|van immediately proceeded to the election of a dey from among them&s;elves. They compiled a new code of laws, and made &s;everal regulations for the better &s;upport and maintenance of this new form of government, to the ob&s;ervation of which they obli|ged all their &s;ubjects to &s;wear; and the militia, navy, commerce, &amp;c. were all &s;ettled pretty near|ly on the footing upon which they now &s;tand: though the &s;ub&s;equent altercations that frequently happened between the ba&s;haws and deys, the one endeavouring to recover their former power, and the other to curtail it, cau&s;ed &s;uch frequent com|plaints

and di&s;contents at the Ottoman court, as made them frequently repent their compliance.</P>
<P>In the year 1601, the Spaniards, under the com|mand of Doria the Genoe&s;e admiral, made ano|ther attempt upon Algiers, in which they were more fortunate than u&s;ual, their fleet being only driven back by contrary winds, &s;o that they came off with|out lo&s;s. In 1609, the Moors being expelled from Spain, flocked in great numbers to Algiers; and as many of them were very able &s;ailors, they un|doubtedly contributed to render the Algerine fleet &s;o formidable as it became &s;oon after; though it is probable the frequent attempts made on their ci|ty would al&s;o induce them to increa&s;e their fleet. In 1616 their fleet con&s;i&s;ted of 40 &s;ail of &s;hips be|tween 200 and 400 tons, their admiral 500 tons. It was divided into two &s;quadrons, one of 18 &s;ail, be|fore the port of Malaga; and the other at the Cape of Santa Maria, between Li&s;bon and Seville; both of which fell foul of all Chri&s;tian &s;hips, both French and Engli&s;h, with whom they pretended to be in friend&s;hip, as well as Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, with whom they were at war.</P>
<P>The Algerines now became very formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards, who were mo&s;t in danger, and lea&s;t able to cope with them, &s;olicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England, the pope, and other &s;tates. The French, however, were the fir&s;t who dared to &s;hew their re&s;entment of the perfidi|ous behaviour of the&s;e mi&s;creants; and in 1617, M. Beaulieu was &s;ent again&s;t them with a fleet of 50 men of war, who defeated their fleet, took two of their ve&s;&s;els, while their admiral &s;unk his own &s;hip and crew, rather than fall into his enemies hands.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="032877_0026_0FF5A82A29D13728">
In 1620, a &s;quadron of Engli&s;h men of war was &s;ent again&s;t Algiers, under the command of Sir Robert Man&s;el; but of this expedition we have no other account, than that it returned without doing any thing; and the Algerines becoming more and more in&s;olent, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only accepted; to whom in 1625, they &s;ent a propo&s;al, directed to the prince of Orange, that in ca&s;e they would fit out 20 &s;ail of &s;hips the following year, upon any good &s;ervice again&s;t the Spaniards, they would join them with 60 &s;ail of their own.</P>
<P>The next year, the <HI>Coulolies,</HI> or <HI>Cologlies,</HI> (the children of &s;uch Turks as had been permitted to marry at Algiers), who were enrolled in the mi|litia, having &s;eized on the citadel, had well nigh made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city; but were at|tacked by the Turks and renegadoes, who defeated them with terrible &s;laughter. Many &s;cores of them were executed, and their heads thrown in heaps upon the city walls, without the ea&s;tern gate. Part of the citadel was blown up; and the remaining Coulolies were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the militia, to which they were not again admitted till long after.</P>
<P>In 1623, the Algerines and other &s;tates of Barbary threw off their dependence on the Porte altogether, and &s;et up for them&s;elves. What gave occa&s;ion to this was the 25 years truce which Sultan Amurath IV. was obliged to make with the emperor Ferdinand II. to prevent his being overmatched by carrying on a war again&s;t him and the Sophi of Per&s;ia at the &s;ame time. As this put a &s;top to the piratical trade of the Algerines, they proceeded as above mentioned; and re&s;olved that whoever de&s;ired to be at peace with them, mu&s;t, di&s;tinctly and &s;eparately, apply to their government. No &s;ooner was this re&s;olution
<PB N="49" REF="032877_0026_0FF5A82A29D13728">
adopted, than the Algerines began to make prizes of &s;everal merchant &s;hips belonging to powers at peace with the Porte. Nay, having &s;eized a Dutch &s;hip and poleacre at Scanderoon, they ventured on &s;hore; and finding the town abandoned by the Turki&s;h aga and inhabitants, they plundered all the magazines and warehou&s;e and &s;et them on fire.</P>
<P>About this time Lewis XIII. undertook to build a fort on their coa&s;ts, in&s;tead of one formerly built by the Mar&s;ilians, and which they had demoli&s;hed. This, after &s;ome difficulty, he accompli&s;hed; and it was called the <HI>Ba&s;tion of France:</HI> but the &s;itua|tion being afterwards found inconvenient, the French purcha&s;ed the port of La Calle, and ob|tained liberty to trade with the Arabians and Moors. The Ottoman court, in the mean time, was &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ed with the Per&s;ian war, that there was no lei&s;ure to check the Alge|rine piracies. This gave an opportunity to the vizir and other courtiers to compound matters with the Algerines, and to get a &s;hare of their prizes, which were very con&s;iderable. However, for form's &s;ake, a &s;evere reprimand, accompanied with threats, was &s;ent them; to which they replied, that "the&s;e depredations de&s;erved to be indulged to them, &s;ee|ing they were the only bulwark again&s;t the Chri&s;|tian powers, e&s;pecially again&s;t the Spaniards, the &s;worn enemies of the Mo&s;lem name. Adding, "that if they &s;hould pay a punctilious regard to all that would purcha&s;e peace, or liberty to trade with the Ottoman empire, they would have nothing to do but &s;et fire to all their &s;hipping, and turn camel-drivers for a livelihood."</P>
<P>In the year 1635, four young brothers of a good family in France, entered into an undertaking &s;o de&s;perate, that perhaps the annals of knight-er|rantry

can &s;carcely furni&s;h a parallel.&mdash;This was no le&s;s than to retort the piracies of the Algerines upon them&s;elves; and as they indi&s;criminately took the &s;hips of all nations, &s;o were the&s;e heroes indi&s;crimi|nately to take the &s;hips belonging to Algiers; and this with a &s;mall frigate of ten guns!&mdash;In this ridicu|lous undertaking 100 volunteers embarked; a Mal|te&s;e commi&s;&s;ion was procured, together with an able ma&s;ter and 36 mariners. They had the good fortune, on their fir&s;t &s;etting out, to take a &s;hip laden with wine, on the Spani&s;h coa&s;t: with which they were &s;o much elated, that three days after they madly encountered two large Algerine cor&s;airs, one of 20 and the other of 24 guns, both well manned, and commanded by able officers.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Algerines continued to pro&s;ecute their pira|cies with impunity, to the terror and di&s;grace of the European powers, till the year 1652; when a French fleet being accidently driven into Algiers, the admiral took it into his head to demand a re|lea&s;e of all the captives of his nation, without ex|ception. This being refu&s;ed, the Frenchman, with|out ceremony, carried off the Turki&s;h viceroy, and his cadi or judge, who were ju&s;t arrived from the Porte, with all their equipage and retinue. The Algerines, by way of repri&s;al, &s;urpri&s;ed the Ba&s;|tion of France already mentioned, and carried off the inhabitants to the number of 600, with all their effects; which &s;o provoked the admiral, that he &s;ent them word that he would pay them another vi&s;it the next year with his whole fleet.</P>
<P>The Algerines, undi&s;mayed by the threats of the French admiral, fitted out a fleet of 16 galleys
<PB N="52" REF="032877_0028_0FF5A82D68A24C48">
and galliots, excellently manned and equipped, under the command of admiral Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i Pinchinin. The chief de&s;ign of this armament was again&s;t the trea&s;ure of Loretto; which, however, they were prevented by contrary winds from obtaining. Upon this they made a de&s;cent of Puglia, in the kingdom of Naples; where they ravaged the whole territory of Necotra, carrying off a va&s;t number of captives, and among them &s;ome nuns. From thence &s;teering towards Dalmatia, they &s;coured the Adriatic; and loading them&s;elves with immen&s;e plunder, left tho&s;e coa&s;ts in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Venetians, alarmed at &s;uch terrible depredations, equipped a fleet of 28 &s;ail, under the command of admiral Capello, with expre&s;s orders to burn, &s;ink and take all the Barbary cor|&s;airs he met with, either on the open &s;ea, or even in the Grand Signior's harbours, pur&s;uant to a late treaty of peace with the Porte. On the other hand, the captain ba&s;haw, who had been &s;ent out with the Turki&s;h fleet to cha&s;e the Florentine and Malte&s;e crui&s;ers out of the Archipelago, under|&s;tanding that the Algerine &s;quadron was &s;o near, &s;ent expre&s;s orders to the admiral to come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Pinchinin readily agreed; but having fir&s;t re&s;olved on a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land of Li&s;&s;a, or Li&s;ina, belonging to the Venetians, he was over|taken by Capello, from whom he retired to Va|lona, a &s;ea port belonging to the Grand Signior, whither the Venetian admiral pur&s;ued him, but the Turki&s;h governor refu&s;ing to eject the pirates ac|cording to the articles of the peace between the Ot|toman court and Venice, Capello was obliged to content him&s;elf with watching them for &s;ome time. Pinchinin was &s;oon weary of re&s;traint, and ventu|red out; when an engagement immediately en&s;u|ed,
<PB N="53" REF="032877_0028_0FF5A82D68A24C48">
in which the Algerines were defeated, and five of their ve&s;&s;els di&s;abled; with the lo&s;s of 1500 men, Turks and Chri&s;tian &s;laves; be&s;ides 1600 galley-&s;laves who regained their liberty. Pinchinin, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where he was again watched by Capello; but the latter had not lain long at his old anchorage before he received a letter from the &s;enate, de&s;iring him to make no far|ther attempt on the pirates at that time, for fear of a rupture with the Porte. This was followed by a letter from the governor of Valona, de&s;iring him to take care le&s;t he incurred the Sultan's di&s;plea&s;ure by &s;uch in&s;ults. The brave Venetian was forced to comply; but re&s;olving to take &s;uch a leave of the Al|gerines as he thought they de&s;erved, ob&s;erved how they had reared their tents, and drawn their booty and equipage along the &s;hore. He then kept firing among the tents, while &s;ome well-manned galliots and brigantines were ordered among their &s;hipping, who attacked them with &s;uch bravery, that, without any great lo&s;s, they towed out their 16 galleys, with all their cannon, &s;tores &amp;c. In this la&s;t en|gagement, a ball from one of the Venetian gallies, happening to &s;trike a Turki&s;h mo&s;que, the whole action was con&s;idered as an in&s;ult upon the Grand Signior. To conceal this, Capello was ordered to &s;ink all the Algerine &s;hips he had taken, except the admiral; which was to be conducted to Venice, and laid up as a trophy. Capello came off with a &s;evere reprimand; but the Venetians were obliged to buy, with 500,000 ducats, a peace from the Porte. The Grand Signior offered to repair the lo&s;s of the Algerines, by building ten galleys for them, up|on condition that they &s;hould continue in his &s;ervice till the end of the en&s;uing &s;ummer; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inchi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, who knew how little the Algerines cho&s;e to

lie under obligations to him, civilly declined the offer.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the news of this defeat and lo&s;s filled Algiers with the utmo&s;t grief and confu|&s;ion. The whole city was on the point of a ge|neral in&s;urrection, when the ba&s;haw and divan i&s;|&s;ued a proclamation, forbidding not only com|plaints and outcries, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties; but all per&s;ons whatever to <HI>take their thumbs from within their girdles,</HI> while they were deliberating on this important point. In the mean time, they applied to the Porte for an order that the Venetians &s;ettled in the Levant &s;hould make up their lo&s;s. But with this the Grand Signior refu&s;ed to comply, and left them to repair their lo&s;&s;es, as well as build new &s;hips, in the be&s;t manner they could. It was not long, however, before they had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee one of their cor&s;airs land, with a fre&s;h &s;upply of 600 &s;laves, whom he had brought from the coa&s;t of Iceland, whither he had been directed by a mi&s;|creant native on board a Dani&s;h &s;hip.</P>
<P>Our pirates did not long continue in their weak and defencele&s;s &s;tate; being able, at the end of two years, to appear at &s;ea with a fleet of 65 &s;ail. The admiral Pinchinin equipped four galliots at his own expence; with which, in conjunction with the chiayah, or &s;ecretary of the ba&s;haw of Tripoli, he made a &s;econd excur&s;ion. This &s;mall &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of five galleys and two brigantines, and manned with their mo&s;t able &s;eaman, fell in with an Engli&s;h &s;hip of 40 guns; which, however, Pinchinin's captains refu&s;ed to engage; but being afterwards reproached by him for their cowardice, they &s;wore they would attack the next Chri&s;tian &s;hip that came in their way. This happened to be a Dutch merchantman, of 28 guns and 40 men, deep|ly
<PB N="55" REF="032877_0029_0FF5A82EF1A1B040">
laden, and unable to u&s;e her &s;ails by rea&s;on of a calm. Pinchinin immediately &s;ummoned her to &s;urrender; but receiving an ironical an&s;wer, drew up his &s;quadron, by means of oars, in the form of a half-moon, that they might pour their &s;hot all at once into their adver&s;ary. But the mo|ment they were preparing to di&s;charge a tremen|dous broad&s;ide into her, a breeze of wind fortu|nately &s;prung up, and enabled him to change his po&s;ition; which threw the Algerine &s;quadron into &s;uch confu&s;ion that they ran foul of each othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> during which Pinchinin ran his own galley alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ide of the merchantman, and 70 Algerines board|ed him with cutla&s;&s;es in their hands; &s;ome cutting away the rigging, and others plying the hatches with hand-grenadoes; but the Dutchmen, hav|ing well &s;ecured them&s;elves in their clo&s;e quar|ters, began to fire upon the Algerines on board their ve&s;&s;el from two pieces of cannon loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, which made &s;uch &s;laughter among them, that they were all either killed or forced to &s;ubmit. Pinchinin, in the mean time, made &s;everal un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempts to relieve his men, as well as to &s;urround the Dutchman with his other galleys: but that &s;hip lay &s;o deep in the water, that every &s;hot did terrible execution among the pirates. Every effort to recover from their confu&s;ion was vain, and the Dutchman continued to pour into them &s;uch vollies of grape-&s;hot and bars of iron, that in le&s;s than ten minutes above 200 of them were killed, and a much greater number wounded; among whom was the chiayah him&s;elf, who received a wound in the belly, of which he died &s;hortly af|ter. The &s;quadron now retired with the utmo&s;t ex|pedition, and returned to Algiers in the mo&s;t di&s;|mal plight.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="032877_0030_0FF5A83D9463AE48">
But though Pinchinin thus returned in di&s;grace, the re&s;t of the fleet captured va&s;t numbers of &s;laves, and an immen&s;e quantity of rich &s;poils; in&s;omuch that the Engli&s;h, French and Dutch, were obliged to cringe to the Algerines, who &s;ometimes vouch|&s;afed to be at peace with them; but &s;wore eternal war again&s;t Spain, Portugal, and Italy, whom they looked upon as the greate&s;t enemies to the Maho|metan name. At la&s;t Lewis XIV. provoked by the grievous outrages committed by the Algerines on the coa&s;ts of Provence and Languedoc, ordered, in 1681, a con&s;iderable fleet to be fitted out a|gain&s;t them, under the Marquis du Que&s;ne, vice-admiral of France. His fir&s;t expedition was again&s;t a number of Tripolitan cor&s;airs; who had the good fortune to outrow him, and &s;helter them&s;elves in the i&s;land of Scio belonging to the Turks. This did not, however, prevent him from pur&s;uing them thi|ther, and making &s;uch terrible fire upon them as quickly de&s;troyed 14 of their ve&s;&s;els, be&s;ides bat|tering the walls of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This &s;everity &s;eemed only to be de&s;igned as a check to the piracies of the Algerines; but, find|ing they &s;till continued their outrages on the French coa&s;t, he &s;ailed to Algiers in Augu&s;t 1682, connonading and bombarding it &s;o furiou&s;ly, that the whole town was in flames in a very little time. The great Mo&s;que was battered down, and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es laid in ruins; in&s;omuch that the inhabi|tants were on the point of abandoning the place; when on a &s;udden the wind turned about, and o|bliged Du Que&s;ne to return to Toulon. The Algerines immediately made repri&s;als, by &s;ending a number of galleys and galliots to the coa&s;ts of Provence, where they committed the mo&s;t dread|ful outrages, and brought away a va&s;t number of
<PB N="57" REF="032877_0030_0FF5A83D9463AE48">
captives: upon which a new armament was order|ed to be got ready at Toulon and Mar&s;eilles, a|gain&s;t the next year; and the Algerines, having received timely notice, put them&s;elves into as a good &s;tate of defence as the time would allow.</P>
<P>In May 1683, Du Que&s;ne with his &s;quadron ca&s;t anchor before Algiers; when being joined by the Marquis d'Affranville, at the head of five &s;tout ve&s;|&s;els, it was re&s;olved to bombard the town next day. Accordingly 100 bombs were thrown into it the fir&s;t day, which did terrible execution; while the be&s;ieged made &s;ome hundred di&s;charges of their cannon again&s;t them, without doing any con&s;ider|able damage. The following night the bombs were again thrown into the city in &s;uch numbers, that the dey's palace and other great edifices were almo&s;t de&s;troyed; &s;ome of their batteries were di&s;|mounted, and &s;everal ve&s;&s;els &s;unk in the port. The dey and Turki&s;h ba&s;haw, as well as the whole &s;ol|diery, alarmed at this dreadful havoc immediately &s;ued for peace. As a preliminary, the immediate &s;urrender was in&s;i&s;ted on, of all Chri&s;tian captives who had been taken fighting under the French flag; which being granted, 142 of them were im|mediately delivered up, with a promi&s;e of &s;ending him the remainder as &s;oon as they could be got from the different parts of the country. Accord|ingly, Du Que&s;ne &s;ent his commi&s;&s;ary-general and one of his engineers into the town; but with expre&s;s orders to in&s;i&s;t upon the delivery of all the French captives without exception, together with the ef|fects they had taken from the French; and that Mezomorto their then admiral, and Hali Rais one of their captains, &s;hould be given as ho&s;tages.</P>
<P>This la&s;t demand having embarra&s;&s;ed the dey, he a&s;&s;embled the Divan, and acquainted them with it;
<PB N="58" REF="032877_0031_0FF5A83F3B4CD8E0">
upon which Mezomorto fell, into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and told the a&s;&s;embly, that the cowardice of tho&s;e who &s;at at the helm, had occa&s;ioned the ruin of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|giers; but that, for his part, he would never con|&s;ent to deliver up any thing that had been taken from the French.</P>
<P>He immediately acquainted the &s;oldiery with what had pa&s;&s;ed; which &s;o exa&s;perated them, that they murdered the dey that very night, and on the morrow cho&s;e Mezomorto in his place. This was no &s;ooner done, than he cancelled all the articles of peace which had been made, and ho&s;tilities were renewed with greater fury than ever.</P>
<P>The French admiral now kept pouring in &s;uch vollies of bombs, that in le&s;s than three days, the greate&s;t part of the city was reduced to a&s;hes, and the fire burnt with &s;uch vehemence, that the &s;ea was enlightened with it for more than &s;ix miles round. Mezomorto, unmoved at all the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, and the va&s;t number of the &s;lain, who&s;e blood ran in rivulets along the &s;treets; or rather grown furi|rious and de&s;perate, &s;ought only how to wreak his vengeance on the enemy; and not content with cau&s;ing all the French in the city to be cruelly mur|dered, ordered their con&s;ul to be tied hand and foot, and fa&s;tened alive to the mouth of a mortar, from whence he was &s;hot away again&s;t their navy. By this piece of inhumanity Du Que&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e was &s;o exa&s;pe|rated, that he did not leave Algiers till he had utterly de&s;troyed all their fortifications, &s;hipping, almo&s;t all the lower part, and above two thirds of the up|per part of the city; by which means it became lit|tle el&s;e than a heap of ruins.</P>
<P>The haughty Algerines were now thoroughly con|vinced that they were not invincible; and, therefore immediately &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y into France, begging
<PB N="59" REF="032877_0031_0FF5A83F3B4CD8E0">
in the mo&s;t humble terms, for peace; which Lewis immediately granted, to their inexpre&s;&s;ible joy. They now began to pay &s;ome regard to other na|tions, and to be a little more cautious how they wan|tonly incurred their di&s;plea&s;ure. The fir&s;t bombard|ment by the French had &s;o far humbled the Algerines, that they conde&s;cended to enter into a treaty with England; which was renewed, upon terms very ad|vantageous to the latter, in 1686. It is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed, however, that the natural perfidy of the Algerines would di&s;appear on a &s;udden: notwith|&s;tanding this treaty, therefore, they lo&s;t no oppor|tunity of making prizes of the Engli&s;h &s;hips when they could conveniently come at them. Upon &s;ome infringement of this kind, captain Beach drove them a&s;hore and burnt &s;even of their frigates in 1695; which produced a renewal of the treaty five years after: but it was not till the taking of Gibraltar and port Mahon, that Britain could have a &s;ufficient check upon them to enforce the ob&s;er|vation of treaties; and the&s;e have &s;ince proved &s;uch re&s;traints upon Algiers, that they &s;till continue to pay a greater deference to the Engli&s;h than to any other European power.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent century furni&s;hes but few very re|markable events with regard to Algiers. The fa|mous city of Oran was, however, taken from the Spaniards in 1708, which they recovered in 1737. In 1710 the Turki&s;h ba&s;haw was expelled, and his office united to that of the dey. This introduced the form of government which &s;till continues in Algiers.</P>
<P>In 1775 the Spaniards made another de&s;cent up|on Algiers. They fitted out this year a very formi|dable fleet con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix &s;hips of the line, twelve frigates, nine xebeques, and twenty-four other armed

ve&s;&s;els, commanded by Don Pedro de Ca&s;tijon; on board of which was embarked a body of 24,447 men, including infantry, cavalry, dragoons, artil|lery-men, mariners, and 600 de&s;erters to &s;erve as workmen, all under the command of Lieutenant general Conde de O'Reilly, a per&s;onal favorite of the late king of Spain. They had likewi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ervice 176 pieces of artillery, mortars, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">vit|zers, with a &s;uitable quantity of military &s;tores. The Spaniards entertained the mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectations of &s;ucce&s;s in this expedition, and a grand ceremonial was performed by the principal officers at the church of St. Franci&s;co, in honor of <HI>La Pu|ri&s;&s;ima Concepcion,</HI> patrone&s;s of all Spain, imploring her protection, and &s;ucce&s;s to the king's arms, af|ter which O'Reilly delivered a pompous oration.</P>
<P>On the 23d of June the fleet &s;et &s;ail from the port of Carthagena in Spain, and on the 1&s;t of July an|chored in the bay of Algiers. They ob&s;erved a large encampment, placed behind a battery, ea&s;t of the little river Xarach, which lies to the ea&s;tward of the city, and &s;everal Moors on hor&s;eback about the beach. On the &s;econd of July a council of the principal officers was held, and orders were given that the troops &s;hould hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to di&s;embark the next morning at day-break. But as the &s;ucceeding night was windy, and a &s;well had &s;et in from the &s;hore, the&s;e orders were countermanded. From this day until the 6th was an interval of inac|tivity; frequent councils were held, in which violent conte&s;ts aro&s;e, and a quarrel en&s;ued between O'Reil|ly, and major general Romana, a Spaniard of an impetuous temper, who appearing to thwart the mea&s;ures of the commander in chief, received from him &s;ome &s;evere reproaches.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="032877_0032_0FF5A840C8B60E88">
On the 6th, all the principal officers were again a&s;&s;embled to receive their ultimate in&s;tructions, when the orders of the 2d of July were &s;trongly recommended; which, however, offended the offi|cers in general, by allotting &s;evere puni&s;hments for trivial neglects. In the&s;e orders the comman|der in chief enjoined the troops not to break their order; as nothing but united force and di&s;cipline could en&s;ure them &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t an enemy &s;o ac|tive and &s;kilful in de&s;ultory war. He particularly warned them of the practice of the Moors, who al|ways feign a mo&s;t violent attack, and upon the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance fly with precipitation, in order to draw their enemy into an ambu&s;cade. But he pointed out to them the very error which they after|wards committed, and the &s;nare into which they were betrayed. On landing, he commanded each brigade to form a column of a company in front, &s;ix deep; and the guards of half a company in front: and directed them to gain &s;ome heights which were &s;uppo&s;ed requi&s;ite to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s a|gain&s;t the city. The di&s;po&s;ition of the march was ordered to be in four columns, with the light in|fantry in advance, and on the flanks; each column was to have four field pieces in front, to be increa&s;ed as exigencies might require: two redoubts were to be formed at the place of di&s;embarkation, and a communication to be kept up between the army, tho&s;e fortifications, and the fleet. In the afternoon of the 6th, &s;ome &s;hips of war were ordered to fire again&s;t three batteries to the ea&s;tward of Algiers. But they were &s;tationed at &s;o great a di&s;tance, through the fear of being raked by the Algerine batteries, that their &s;hot did not reach the &s;hore!&mdash;except tho&s;e of the St. Jo&s;eph, of 74 guns, which received &s;ome damage
<PB N="62" REF="032877_0033_0FF5A84257EFBB38">
from the enemy. At &s;un-&s;et this <HI>very</HI> cautious at|tack cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 7th at day-break, between eight and nine thou&s;and men were put on board of boats for land|ing. They advanced very near the &s;hore, about a mile to the we&s;tward of the river Xarach, under the protection of &s;even galleys, and two long boats with a twelve pounder each; not a Moor appear|ing to oppo&s;e their landing. At &s;even o'clock in the morning they <HI>returned</HI> on board the tran&s;ports, and not a &s;hot was fired on either &s;ide the whole day! Orders were then given for the tran&s;port long boats to be manned with Spani&s;h &s;eamen, and to be in readine&s;s at day-break the next morning.</P>
<P>On the 8th at day-break the &s;hips were po&s;ted to batter the different forts to the right and left of the place of di&s;embarkation, and 8000 troops were put on board of boats, which formed in &s;ix columns; at the head of which were the grenadiers, preceded by the armed xebeques, galliots, &amp;c. that were to cover their landing. The firing from the &s;hips began, and the troops moved on to the place of di&s;embarkation, where they effected their landing on the beach, (about a league to the ea&s;tward of the city), between the intervals of firing from the cover|ing ve&s;&s;els; and immediately above 80,000 Moors appeared in &s;ight, two-thirds of which were caval|ry, under the bey of Con&s;tantina; but they did not attempt to oppo&s;e the landing of the Spani&s;h for|ces. The Turks in the mean time remained to defend the city, and not one of them appeared to di&s;pute the ground. It is &s;aid that the whole num|ber of Africans collected on this occa&s;ion was not le&s;s than 150,000, of which 100,000 were cavalry. As &s;oon as the 8000 Spaniards had made good their landing, they formed &s;ix deep, according to or|ders;
<PB N="63" REF="032877_0033_0FF5A84257EFBB38">
the armed ve&s;&s;els divided to the right and left, to cover their flanks; and the boats returned to bring the re&s;t of the army on &s;hore with all ex|pedition. The troops of the fir&s;t di&s;embarkation had &s;carcely formed, when a detachment of the enemy appeared in their front; but upon ob&s;erving a movement of the Spaniards towards them, they fled in di&s;order. The troops then marched for|ward, by the beat of drum, with the volunteers of Arragon and Catolonia in front, until they were engaged in a clo&s;e country, which the enemy had occupied in &s;mall parties; but po&s;ted &s;o advanta|geou&s;ly in ditches and fortre&s;&s;es, that they made great havoc among the Spaniards, without receiv|ing any injury in return. The Spani&s;h grenadiers, and light infantry, which had been detached in advance, were repul&s;ed. At this juncture they were reinforced by the troops of the &s;econd di&s;em|barkation, and &s;ome heavy cannon coming up which protected their march, they again advanced towards &s;ome inclo&s;ures, where they directed a hea|vy fire; but without being able to di&s;lodge the ene|my. Great numbers of the Spaniards fell without gaining the lea&s;t advantage; in con&s;equence of which their whole body fell into confu&s;ion. The zeal and intrepidity of the officers was in&s;ufficient to contain the men; &s;ome advanced, and others retired, in an indi&s;criminate manner, ju&s;t as they judged it expedient, without any regard to the command of their officers. While they were in this critical &s;ituation, a drove of camels appeared, ex|tending on their left, conducted by &s;ome Moors, with a de&s;ign of drawing the fire of the enemy upon them. Great was the &s;laughter of the Spaniards, and in this extremity a cry was &s;pread that they were cut off by the Moori&s;h hor&s;e. The utmo&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="032877_0034_0FF5A85144481D78">
confu&s;ion &s;ucceeded, and the whole body fled with the greate&s;t precipitation, leaving on the field of battle an immen&s;e number of wounded, whom they were obliged to abandon to the mercy of their ene|mies. By this time the workmen and troops of the third di&s;embarkation were forming entrench|ments, which they had already fortified with three eight pounders; which did great execution; at the &s;ame time the Tu&s;can commanders drew their frigates clo&s;e into &s;hore, and kept up &s;uch a well-directed fire, that the Spaniards were enabled to make good their retreat into their entrenchments, which were, however, &s;carcely large enough to contain their army. In this crowded &s;ituation they were much annoyed by a thirty-&s;ix pounder which the enemy brought out of one of their batteries, and an elevated fire from the fort of Xarach con|tributed much to the mi&s;chief. The Moors at|tacked them in their trenches, but they were re|pul&s;ed with great &s;laughter, and in this &s;ituation the Spaniards remained till dark, when they began their re-imbarkation in great tumult and confu&s;ion; but what di&s;covered the ignorance of the Moors, was their neglecting &s;o favourable an opportunity of obtaining the complete&s;t of victories.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the Spaniards on this occa|&s;ion, amounted to 27 officers killed, and 191 wound|ed; 501 men killed, and 2,088 wounded. The Marquis of Romana was killed at the head of his brigade in the commencement of the action. The lo&s;s of the Moors it is &s;aid, was between five and &s;ix thou&s;and killed, and as many wounded; but this &s;eems improbable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above account is agreeable to the Spani&s;h court gazettes, (in which truth is &s;eldom expected), and agrees with Dalrymple's &s;tatement, who &s;ays it nearly corre&s;ponds with a letter from Algiers. But other wri|ters &s;tate the Spani&s;h lo&s;s much greater, and it is at lea&s;t evident that there cannot be &s;o wide a difference in the lo&s;s between the parties, e&s;pecially as the Spaniards made &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion on the Moors in their ditches, &amp;c.</NOTE> The government of Algiers
<PB N="65" REF="032877_0034_0FF5A85144481D78">
had offered a premium of ten &s;equins for every Spa|niard's head, and con&s;equently the wounded Spa|niards, who were left on the field of battle, were all murdered. The unfortunate invaders left behind them on their retreat, 15 pieces of cannon, three howitzers, and a great number of &s;mall arms and ammunition.</P>
<P>On the 12th of July, the troops, and the great|e&s;t part of the fleet &s;et &s;ail on their return to Spain, and thus terminated this Quixotic expedition; of which a Spani&s;h &s;erjeant, in giving an account to his wife, ludicrou&s;ly &s;ays, <HI>Nos mandaron a tierra, como &s;i ibemos a beber caf&egrave; con los Moros;</HI> "we were commanded a-&s;hore as if we were to drink coffee with the Moors."</P>
<P>When the melancholy intelligence was announ|ced of the failure of this expedition, from which the Spani&s;h nation had formed &s;uch &s;anguine expecta|tions of &s;ucce&s;s, the national feelings were indi&s;|cribable. O'Reilly was in con&s;equence &s;o cordi|ally dete&s;ted, that mobs a&s;&s;embled upon the road to Alicant with an intent to wreak their vengeance up|on him. They &s;topped many carriages, and that O'Reilly (who was lame) might not be concealed, they made the people get out and walk before them. Had the liberty of the pre&s;s prevailed the world would have known the &s;entiments of the Spani&s;h nation upon this occa&s;ion. The king was threaten|ed if his favorite &s;hould ever appear at court again,

and to appea&s;e the turbulence of the people he was &s;oon after removed from the governor&s;hip of Madrid.</P>
<P>Since the failure of this expedition the Spaniards have attempted nothing deci&s;ive again&s;t Algiers. In the years 1783 and 1784, indeed, they renewed their attacks by &s;ea to de&s;troy the city and galleys; but after &s;pending a great quantity of ammunition, bombs, &amp;c. they were obliged to retire without ei|ther its capture or extinction.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the American inde|pendence, when the United States had relin|qui&s;hed their maritime dependence upon the Engli&s;h nation, it followed as a natural con&s;equence, that the American commerce mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice to the ravages of the Algerine cor&s;airs; and no doubt it was through the intrigues of the Briti&s;h cabinet, who were chagrined at our recent emancipation, that their ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition was &s;o quickly manife&s;ted. Various circum&s;tances concurred to render them eligible objects of piratical rapacity. America was &s;ituated at the di&s;tance of more than three thou&s;and miles from the theatre of their piracies, and as &s;he &s;upported no maritime force they were enabled to
<PB N="68" REF="032877_0036_0FF5A854584D8308">
continue their depredations with impunity. Her exten&s;ive commerce with Europe pre&s;ented a &s;plen|did allurement to the pirates, who were well aware that the prevention of their aggre&s;&s;ions would re|quire a naval armament greatly &s;uperior to the &s;ub|&s;tantial benefits that could be derived from an at|tempt to reduce them to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. It is, how|ever, by no means problematical, that the naval force of the United States, with judicious comman|ders, would prove fully competent to reduce their fleet, if not to effect the de&s;truction of their city. According to the mo&s;t authentic accounts, their na|vy is at pre&s;ent extremely incon&s;iderable, and ma|ny of the American captives concur in the a&s;&s;ertion, that the fleet of this regency only amounted in 1796 to five frigates, two xebecks, and one half gal|ley! a force by no means to be put in competition with that which could be rai&s;ed by the United States. But to bring all their &s;hips of war to a re|gular engagement at once, would be totally im|practicable; for whenever an ho&s;tile armament &s;cours the Mediterranean they immediately fly for refuge to the guns of their fortifications.</P>
<P>When we reflect upon the peculiar encourage|ment they had to commit depredations on our com|merce, it becomes rather a matter of wonder that we &s;uffered &s;o little, than that we &s;uffered &s;o much. For this &s;ecurity we were greatly indebted to the wars which exi&s;ted between the Algerines, the Portugue&s;e and the Dutch, at the time they com|menced their ravages upon our trade; either of which powers are greatly &s;uperior to the cor&s;airs in maritime &s;trength, and they &s;o narrowly watched the entrance of the Mediterranean for the protection of their own commerce, that the pirates were &s;el|dom able to crui&s;e out into the Atlantic. Tho&s;e

American ve&s;&s;els that &s;ometimes ventured into the &s;treights were generally &s;afe; for they derived their &s;ecurity either from forged or purcha&s;ed Mediter|ranean pa&s;&s;ports.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the vigilance with which the Portugue&s;e guarded the &s;treights, the Algerines &s;ometimes &s;tole out into the Atlantic, and in one of the&s;e excur&s;ions, which happened while the Por|tugue&s;e fleet were ordered upon &s;ome &s;ecret expedi|tion, the &s;chooner Maria, captain Stephens, be|longing to Mr. Fo&s;ter of Bo&s;ton, was captured by a cor&s;air off Cape St. Vincents, on the 25th of July 1785; and five days afterwards, the &s;hip Dolphin, captain O'Brien, belonging to Me&s;&s;rs. Irvines of Philadelphia, was taken by another about 50 leagues to the we&s;tward of Li&s;bon. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els, with their cargoes and crews, about 21 in number, were carried into Algiers, where they were made &s;laves.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of the year 1793, a truce was made between the court of Li&s;bon and the regency of Algiers, for the period of twelve months, and in con&s;equence, nine &s;ail of Algerine crui&s;ers pa&s;&s;ed out through the Streights of Gibral|tar into the Atlantic ocean. Their crui&s;ing &s;ta|tion was between Cape St. Vincents and the we&s;|tern i&s;lands, where they continued to crui&s;e the greate&s;t part of the winter, contrary to their former cu&s;tom of retiring from the ocean in November. In con&s;equence of this truce, the courts of Li&s;bon and Madrid granted convoys to American ve&s;&s;els homeward bound, to a certain latitude where they were free from th&egrave; cor&s;airs.</P>
<P>On the 18th of October 1793, about five leagues from Gibraltar, captain John M'Shane of the Mi|nerva, was boarded by a xebeck of 20 guns, be|longing
<PB N="70" REF="032877_0037_0FF5A855DEC43880">
to Algiers, who after coming within mu&s;|ket-&s;hot, kept a con&s;tant firing with &s;mall-arms until the yards of the American ve&s;&s;el were manned from tho&s;e of the crui&s;er. The firing then cea&s;ed; they came down &s;word in hand and made the Ame|rican crew pri&s;oners; &s;tripped them of their clothes, and put them on board the xebeck, which carried them to Algiers, where they arrived the 30th of Octo|ber. As &s;oon as they had arrived they were taken before the dey, and after examination, were or|dered to the Bagnio, where the &s;laves are kept lock|ed up at night. The next day they were bound with iron chains, each about 40 pounds weight, which reached from their legs to their hips, and &s;ent to the marine, where they were kept at hard labour from day-light till dark.</P>
<P>On the 23d of October, captain William Pen|ro&s;e, of the &s;hip Pre&s;ident of Philadelphia, di&s;cov|ered, about 9 o'clock in the morning, a &s;ail to the windward bearing down upon him, which the &s;hip's company at fir&s;t imagined to be a Spani&s;h privateer. But they were &s;oon fatally deceived; for &s;he proved to be an Algerine cor&s;air. As &s;oon as &s;he di&s;covered the American flag &s;he hoi&s;ted out her boat immediately, and 30 men armed with pi&s;tols and drawn cutla&s;&s;es furiou&s;ly boarded his ve&s;&s;el. The fir&s;t &s;alutation the captain received was a violent &s;troke with a cutla&s;s; after which they compelled the whole &s;hip's company to jump over the rail of the ve&s;&s;el into their boat, without &s;uffering any one to go below for their clothes, and other nece&s;&s;ary articles. The crew were then car|ried on board the crui&s;er, where they were &s;tripped naked, and a few old rags were given them in re|turn, neither &s;ufficient to conceal their nakedne&s;s, nor protect them from the cold.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="032877_0037_0FF5A855DEC43880">
In this &s;ituation they were obliged to lie on deck, where they &s;uffered great hard&s;hips from the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on. Captain Penro&s;e tells us he was forced to lie on the poop, where he was almo&s;t peri&s;hed by a bitter north-ea&s;t wind; till at length an old man, more humane than the re&s;t, furni&s;hed him with a blanket. The provi&s;ions given them to eat, were black bread and water, and &s;ome|times a few rotten olives, which they regarded as a great dainty.</P>
<P>In this forlorn &s;ituation they continued eight days, and on the 30th of October they arrived at Algiers. Here they were &s;ubjected to a new &s;e|ries of mi&s;ery. They thought them&s;elves cruelly treated on board the crui&s;er; but their treatment there was plea&s;ure when contra&s;ted with the mi&s;e|ries they afterwards experienced. They were &s;carcely on &s;hore when they were loaded with irons, and immediately put to hard labour like &s;o many criminals.</P>
<P>The number of American pri&s;oners now amounted to about 130, among whom were captains Stephens and O'Brien, who&s;e crews had been reduced to ten by the plague, and the &s;everity of their treatment for upwards of eight years. The &s;mall pittance they had received from the United States had been withheld about three months before; and their only &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was a little black bread and water, and &s;ometimes nothing.</P>
<P>In their October expedition they captured ten &s;ail of American ve&s;&s;els, nine of which &s;afely entered the harbour of Algiers on the 30th of October where the ve&s;&s;els anchored, amid&s;t the &s;houts of the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The names of the American captains and their pla|ces of re&s;idence are as follows:&mdash;Captains Wallace, Vir|ginia; Newman, Bo&s;ton; Taylor, Rhode-I&s;land; Furnace, New-Hamp&s;hire; Calder, Glouce&s;ter; Burnham, New-York; Bailey, Newbury; Mo&s;s, ditto; M'Shane and Penro&s;e, Philadelphia.</NOTE>.</P>

The Algerine cor&s;airs, greatly animated with the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition, immediately &s;et &s;ail to re|&s;ume their former &s;tation; while others were equip|ping in the harbour with the utmo&s;t &s;peed. But for|tunately the mi&s;creants only captured one Ameri|can ve&s;&s;el, about a month afterwards, belonging to captain Jo&s;eph Ingraham; for the Americans were extremely cautious how they came within the &s;phere of their rapacity; and, after the&s;e captures, they never fell in with any American ve&s;&s;els, but tho&s;e that were protected by convoys.</P>
<P>After the&s;e events, the American pri&s;oners were &s;ubjected to a &s;eries of mi&s;ery which humani|ty blu&s;hes to record. As &s;oon as they landed in Algiers, they were immediately ordered to the dey's palace, where they were drawn up in files, in a back court, and underwent a &s;trick examination. The dey, attended by his cook, pa&s;&s;ed and re|pa&s;&s;ed in front of them, and was extremely plea&s;ed with their appearance. He &s;elected from their num|ber all the boys and younger men, whom he em|ployed in his palace at different occupations, ge|nerally of a &s;ervile nature; &s;ome were ordered to &s;weep the apartments, &s;ome to wa&s;h clothes, and others to wait upon the dey and take care of his wardrobe. The re&s;t of the pri&s;oners were then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and as they withdrew from the royal pre&s;ence, the dey &s;aid to them, in the tone of &s;a|vage triumph, "<HI>Go now you dogs and eat &s;tones."</HI> They were then e&s;corted to the Bagnio Baleck,
<PB N="73" REF="032877_0038_0FF5A86419EDFC38">
where they were lodged in different apartments among the old &s;laves, and each pri&s;oner furni&s;hed with a couple of coar&s;e blankets for his bedding. In this di&s;mal region of mi&s;ery and oppre&s;&s;ion, amid&s;t the clanking of chains and the cries of &s;uf|fering humanity, they were left to brood over their mi&s;fortunes at lei&s;ure.

<P>About midnight they were rou&s;ed from their meditations by the cry of <HI>Sur&s;a, Sur&s;a,</HI> ri&s;e up all hands. The <HI>Li&s;bero,</HI> or guardian of the Bagnio, then entered their apartments, and loaded each pri&s;oner with chains of thirty or forty pounds weight. The next morning about day-break they were ordered to the marine, where, after their names were called over, they were employed in di&s;charging the cargoes of their own ve&s;&s;els, which con&s;i&s;ted of wheat, flour, wine, &s;ugar, and other articles. Their general employment in the ma|rine was the rigging and fitting out of crui&s;ers, and whenever any foreign ve&s;&s;el lay in the harbour they were obliged to wear this enormous weight of chains, le&s;t they &s;hould make their e&s;cape; but at other times they were freed from their load, ex|cept tho&s;e who were turbulent, or by any particu|lar mi&s;conduct had forfeited this privilege of the &s;laves.</P>
<P>The hour of four in the afternoon is called <HI>lazar,</HI> at which time a white flag is hoi&s;ted upon the tops of all the mo&s;ques in the city, as a &s;ignal for the inhabitants to quit their labour, and repair to pub|lic wor&s;hip. At this hour the labour of the pri&s;on|ers cea&s;ed, and they were permitted to go on &s;hore, except when any bu&s;ine&s;s of importance occurred,
<PB N="74" REF="032877_0039_0FF5A865A4324028">
and when that was the ca&s;e they were generally con|fined till dark.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were ordered on &s;hore they were provided with in&s;truments to carry &s;tones from the mole to a grand mo&s;que, which the dey was build|ing in the city adjoining his &s;eraglio. The&s;e in|&s;truments were formed of cro&s;s pieces of timber, called <HI>burrils,</HI> to which the &s;ton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, timber, cannon or whatever el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to be carried, were &s;u&s;pended beneath by ropes, and borne upon the &s;houlders of four men, who were appointed to carry each burril. A particular load was always a&s;&s;igned them, and the weak and the &s;trong were indi&s;cri|minately compelled to carry the&s;e burdens, without any attention being paid to the comparative bodily &s;trength of the labourer. To per&s;ons of robu&s;t con&s;titutions the&s;e loaded burrils were tolerable, but to tho&s;e of weak habits of body they were en|tirely in&s;upportable; and hence it happened, that many per&s;ons, by being over&s;trained, were either blinded, or extremely injured in their con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>When the proce&s;&s;ion of loaded burrils was ready to move, the warden ba&s;haw, who &s;tood at the port of the marine, waved his wand as a &s;ignal for the &s;laves to advance to the port, where they were ex|amined by the wardens of the marine, for the pur|po&s;e of di&s;covering whether they had &s;tolen any particular articles from the ve&s;&s;els. After this ex|amination they were permitted to pa&s;s with their loads, which they depo&s;ited at the new mo&s;que, and then retired with their in&s;truments to their re&s;pect|ive lodgings; &s;ome to the Bagnio Baleck, and others to the Bagnio Gallaro, where their names were called over by the clerks, and each &s;lave as he pa&s;|&s;ed received a loaf of black bread for his &s;upper.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time they were obliged to &s;leep upon
<PB N="75" REF="032877_0039_0FF5A865A4324028">
the ground; but they &s;oon con&s;tructed for them|&s;elves a kind of wooden frames, which were &s;wung like hammocks one above another, and upon the&s;e they threw their clothes and blankets when they were about to retire to re&s;t: but to add to their mi&s;e|ries, their &s;leep was ince&s;&s;antly di&s;turbed by infinite numbers of vermin with which the&s;e Bagnios &s;war|med. In the morning they again repaired with their burrils to the marine, where their names were called over; and in this manner were they con&s;tantly employed whenever the equipment of the Algerine cor&s;airs was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Many of the &s;laves, however, were di&s;tributed in different parts; &s;ome were &s;ent into the country, and whenever the &s;ea was calm, and no particular emergency required their labour in the marine, great numbers of others were employed in remov|ing &s;tones from a mountain called <HI>Babloet,</HI> or ra|ther <HI>Bublywhite,</HI> about a league from the city, in or|der to defend the mole from the impetuo&s;ity of the waves. The&s;e &s;tones were blown by &s;laves from the immen&s;e rocks which lie depo&s;ited in the moun|tain, and &s;ome of them were twelve or fifteen feet in diameter. In order to convey them more con|veniently to the water, the &s;laves were engaged for more than a year, in forming a pa&s;&s;age through a large hill, which they removed and carried into the &s;ea, where they formed a large mole or wharf to protect their <HI>pantoons,</HI> or carrying boats, from the violence of the waves. In forming this pa&s;&s;age they dug through a Moori&s;h burial ground, from whence they removed immen&s;e numbers of human bones. The&s;e repo&s;itories of the dead are always regarded as &s;acred by the Moors, and the whole neighbour|hood, and particularly the women, were, in con&s;e|quence, thrown into the greate&s;t con&s;ternation.
<PB N="76" REF="032877_0040_0FF5A8672CB8AF48">
They re&s;orted to this &s;cene of &s;acrilege, and in|dulged the mo&s;t immoderate grief over this deva&s;|tation among the relics of their friends. But &s;uch were the orders of the dey, and they were obliged to &s;ubmit patiently to his will.</P>
<P>After this pa&s;&s;age was formed, the&s;e immen&s;e fragments of rocks were dragged by &s;laves, with great labour and difficulty, from the mountain, and placed upon &s;trong carriages about two feet high; upon which they were conveyed to the wharf, by upwards of two hundred &s;laves to each carriage, where they were thrown into pantoons; from thence they were tran&s;ported by water, and di&s;charged at the mole before the city.</P>
<P>But when the &s;ea was tempe&s;tuous and the pan|toons could not be navigated, the &s;laves were then employed in carrying &s;maller &s;tones by land. After having &s;u&s;pended a load to their burrils, of &s;uch a weight as &s;ome were &s;carcely able to &s;tagger un|der, they proceeded in gangs of different numbers, attended by a crew of &s;avage drivers, who goaded them forward whenever they halted or happened to faulter under the pre&s;&s;ure of their burdens. The extremity of their &s;ufferings in this laborious em|ployment is better conceived than expre&s;&s;ed. The mo&s;t barbarous puni&s;hments were wantonly inflic|ted, and the violence of a &s;corching &s;un, which poured its fervid rays upon them, &s;eemed to complete the mea&s;ure of human wretchedne&s;s. With this enormous weight of &s;tones they moved forward, attended by wardens who preceded them in order to clear the &s;treets of the city through which they pa&s;&s;ed, where every per&s;on was obliged to give way at their approach. After having di&s;|charged their loads at the mole they returned, and in this manner were they employed during the
<PB N="77" REF="032877_0040_0FF5A8672CB8AF48">
&s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, when no particular emergencies demanded their labour in the marine. This mole, in con&s;equence of the encroachments of the &s;ea du|ring the winter, requires an eternal &s;upply of &s;tones, and in this manner is this Si&s;yphaean labour conducted by a herd of wretches who are of|ten doomed to this abject &s;ervitude for life. The dey commonly rides out to his country-&s;eat about twice a week, where his favorite wife re&s;ides in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, and in pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing he would &s;ometimes conde&s;cend to di&s;tribute &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents among the &s;laves.</P>
<P>The over&s;eers in their treatment towards the &s;laves &s;eemed actuated by a principle of the mo&s;t &s;avage cruelty, and inflicted the mo&s;t rigorous pu|ni&s;hments through mere caprice and wantonne&s;s, in order to fea&s;t their malignant &s;ouls with the ago|nies of the trembling wretch who &s;tood ready to ex|pire beneath their h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nds. Among this troop of furies, a certain <HI>cheriff,</HI> a name given to all tho&s;e who are born on Friday, mo&s;t eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf. The inordinate ferocity of this barbarian had proved the death of many of &s;lave, and the mi&s;creant was mo&s;t cordially dete&s;ted wherever he came. One day as he was pur&s;uing a Genoe&s;e &s;lave through the upper apartments of one of the magazines on the &s;ea-&s;ide, he fell, by &s;ome accident, from a con&s;iderable eminence upon a heap of &s;tones, where he met with &s;o hard a recep|tion that he in&s;tantly expired. This accident pro|duced the mo&s;t extravagant joy among the &s;laves, which was only marred with the apprehen&s;ion that the &s;avage would recover: but they &s;oon had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing him &s;afely lodged in the earth.</P>
<P>It would perhaps be improper to de&s;cend to par|ticulars here, and we mu&s;t therefore refer the reader

for particular anecdotes, occurrences, and other ar|ticles which regard our countrymen, to our ob&s;er|vations upon the &s;laves.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the &s;ufferings of our fellow citizens in Algiers were the univer&s;al &s;ubject of &s;ympathy and regret; and mea&s;ures were &s;oon adopted to effect their deliverance from this region of unparalleled mi&s;ery. Colonel Humphreys, who had been appointed American con&s;ul for Algiers, left America in April 1795, in company with Jo|&s;eph Donald&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> of Philadelphia, who had been appointed con&s;ul for Tunis and Tripoli, and whom Colonel Humphreys was authori&s;ed to em|ploy in the negociation of a treaty of peace and amity with Algiers, while he proceeded to France for the purpo&s;e of obtaining the co-operation of that government in this negociation.</P>
<P>They arrived at Gibraltar the 17th of May, where Col. Humphreys concluded that it would be expedient for Mr. Donald&s;on to go fir&s;t to Alicant, to the northward of Carthagena in Spain, rather than to Algiers, there to re&s;ide for &s;ome time, in order that he might be near the &s;cene of negocia|tion, and take advantage of any favorable occur|rences that might happen. Mr. Donald&s;on receiv|ed his in&s;tructions accordingly, and immediately &s;et out for that place; and in the mean time Col. Humphreys, having al&s;o given in&s;tructions to Mr. Simp&s;on, the American con&s;ul at Gibraltar, to re|new a peace with the emperor of Morocco, &s;ailed from Gibraltar the 24th of May, and on the 26th of June following arrived at Havre de-Grace in France; from whence he immediately &s;et out for Paris, where he &s;oon after communicated the ob|ject of his mi&s;&s;ion to Col. Monroe, the American
<PB N="79" REF="032877_0041_0FF5A868B24A6B90">
mini&s;ter, and to the Committee of Public Safety of that Republic.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of July Col. Humphreys receive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a ver|bal notification that the French Republic was di&s;po&s;ed to exert its influence in forwarding the negociation in que&s;tion; and on the 28th he received the favorable intelligence, that immediate mea&s;ures &s;hould be a|dopted for giving particular in&s;tructions to the agents of the Republic to u&s;e its influence in the promotion of the treaty in contemplation. The multiplicity of national concerns with which the officers of the French government were then occupied, and the time requi&s;ite for obtaining from London ( where funds had been depo&s;ited) the &s;ums of money in|tended as peace pre&s;ents, retarded the conclu&s;ion of arrangements at Paris till &s;ome time in Septem|ber.</P>
<P>In the mean time it had been deemed expedient by Cols. Monroe and Humphreys, that Joel Bar|low, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> &s;hould be con&s;ulted, and if his a&s;&s;ent could be obtained that he &s;hould be employed in negociating with the Barbary States: to which Mr. Barlow con&s;ented. By the 11th of September all the papers on the part of Col. Humphreys relative to Mr. Barlow's mi&s;&s;ion were in readine&s;s, and as &s;oon as the peace pre&s;ents were prepared for him, he &s;et out, with in&s;tructions and powers from the Re|public of France to its agents in Barbary, to exe|cute the bu&s;ine&s;s that had been entru&s;ted to him.</P>
<P>On the 12th of September Col. Humphreys left Paris, and arrived at Havre-de-Grace the 14th; where he found the captain and mate of the United States brig Sophia both &s;ick with fevers. While he was waiting here with great impatience for their recovery, he received information from the Ameri|can con&s;ul at Mar&s;eilles, that Mr. Donald&s;on had
<PB N="80" REF="032877_0042_0FF5A8770C40B418">
concluded a treaty of peace with the dey of Al|giers. He judged it expedient, notwith&s;tanding, that Mr. Barlow &s;hould proceed with the pre&s;ents, and if they were not wanted at Algiers they would be nece&s;&s;ary in the negociation with Tunis and Tri|poli.</P>
<P>Col. Humphreys &s;ailed from Havre-de-Grace about the 5th of October, and after a &s;tormy pa&s;|&s;age of more than forty days, arrived at Li&s;bon the 17th of November, where he found captain O'Bri|en, who had arrived about the 1&s;t of October, with the treaty with Algiers. Mr. Donald&s;on arrived at Algiers on the 3d of September; the treaty was concluded on the 5th, and the peace pre&s;ents immediately given by a loan. As Mr. Donald&s;on knew that funds had been lodged in London to fulfil the &s;tipulations of the treaty, he engaged to make the payments in three or four months.</P>
<P>Col. Humphreys had received advice, under date of the 30th of July, from the Me&s;&s;rs. Barings in London, to whom the funds had been remitted, that having made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ales of the United States &s;tock, they &s;hould have at his di&s;po&s;al the whole of the value of 800,000 dollars, meaning to furni&s;h, by anticipation, the value of that part which remained un&s;old, if the &s;ervice of the United States required it. Col. Humphreys, calculating upon the certainty of payment after this period, &s;ent captain O'Brien from Li&s;bon to Lon|don in the brig Sophia to receive the money. But owing to contrary winds he did not leave Li&s;bon till the 24th of December.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the di&s;appointments in the pecuniary arrangements the treaty was in the mo&s;t imminent danger of being ultimately fru&s;trated; the dey became impatient, and threatened to aban|don

it; and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that it was prevented. Mr. Barlow did not arrive at Alicant until February 1796, where he pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">o&s;ed to wait the arrival of the funds; but &s;hortly after receiving intelligence from Algiers that the Ame|rican negociation was in a mo&s;t critical &s;ituation, he determined to go thither immediately with the hopes of &s;oothing the dey. He arrived there the 5th of March. The time for the payment of the &s;tipulated &s;ums had before been prolonged to the 8th of April. On the 3d of that month the dey declared that his final determination was, that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Donald&s;on &s;hould leave Algiers in eight days; and if the money was not paid in 30 days after, the treaty &s;hould be at end, and his cor&s;airs be permitted to bring in American ve&s;&s;els. Under the&s;e imperious circum&s;tances, and as the la&s;t hope of &s;aving the treaty, they were induced to offer the dey the pre&s;ent of a frigate; which fortunately &s;ucceeded. But Col. Humphreys con|ceiving him&s;elf not authori&s;ed to confirm this pro|mi&s;e, di&s;patched captain O'Brien in the brig So|phia to America, for the purpo&s;e of referring the matter to the executive of the United States, and obtaining his concurrence.

<P>Captain O'Brien after he had received the deter|mination of the executive, &s;et &s;ail from Philadel|phia in June 1796, and arrived in Li&s;bon &s;ometime in July. In the mean time Col. Humphreys had advantageou&s;ly negociated bills on London for 225,000 dollars, which he had received, and this &s;um was embarked on board the brig Sophia, con|&s;igned to the care of captain O'Brien. This mo|ney was in&s;ured at a &s;mall premium again&s;t the dan|gers of the &s;eas; but again&s;t all ri&s;ks &s;o high a pre|mium was demanded that Col. Humphreys judged it inexpedient to give it, &s;eeing the Sophia was a ve&s;&s;el of the United States having a &s;pecial pa&s;&s;port from the Pre&s;ident, as well as one in the Turki&s;h lan|guage under the &s;eal of the dey of Algiers.</P>
<P>On the 4th of Augu&s;t capt. O'Brien &s;et &s;ail for Algiers, and on the 18th he was captured off that ci|ty by a Tripolitan cor&s;air, who carried his ve&s;&s;el, money and crew in triumph to Tripoli, (which lies on the Mediterranean, about 130 miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward of Algiers), accompanied by the &s;hip Bet|&s;y of Bo&s;ton, who&s;e crew were made &s;laves. This immen&s;e &s;um in &s;pecie, more perhaps than they had ever captured at once before, was landed amid&s;t the firing of cannon, the di&s;play of colours, and the &s;houts of the populace. The extravagance of their
<PB N="83" REF="032877_0043_0FF5A87899421C38">
joy, however, was &s;oon abated when capt. O'Brien exhibited to them the pa&s;&s;port of the dey of Algiers; he demon&s;trated to them that he was &s;till the &s;lave of the dey, and though the money had been deli|vered to him by the United States, yet it was the the &s;ame in effect as if it had been delivered to the dey him&s;elf. After an examination of two days the ve&s;&s;el was liberated, and capt. O'Brien immedi|ately &s;et &s;ail for Algiers, where he arrived the fir&s;t of October, and delivered the money to the Ameri|can con&s;ul re&s;iding there; who had previou&s;ly pro|cured the loan of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums from the Me&s;&s;rs. Buckras, a Jewi&s;h company in Algiers, who had received &s;atisfactory information of the certain|ty of repayment. With this timely loan Mr. Bar|low fulfilled his &s;tipulations with the dey, who was &s;o highly plea&s;ed with the pre&s;ent, and in con&s;equence repo&s;ed &s;uch confidence in the United States, that he offered Mr. Barlow upon their account the loan of &s;uch &s;ums as would enable him to negociate a treaty of peace with the Tuni&s;ian and Tripolitan powers, which he judged proper to accept.</P>
<P>By the judicious arrangements of Mr. Barlow with the dey, capt. O'Brien was appointed com|mi&s;&s;ioner on behalf of the United States to negoci|ate a treaty with the regencies of Tunis and Tripo|li. He &s;et &s;ail upon this bu&s;ine&s;s the 10th of Octo|ber, and arrived at Tunis on the 16th, where he had an interview with the bey, to whom he pre&s;ent|ed a letter from the dey of Algiers, enclo&s;ing a command that he &s;hould make peace with the Ame|rican commi&s;&s;ioner upon the terms therein pre&s;cri|bed. But the bey totally rejected the terms, and demanded the payment of a &s;um equal to thrice that amount. After many audiences and conferences, capt. O'Brien, finding that the bey would neither
<PB N="84" REF="032877_0044_0FF5A867105414E70">
accept of a le&s;s &s;um, nor accede to the terms of the dey, tran&s;mitted the Tuni&s;ian demand to Mr. Bar|low in Algiers, which he communicated to the dey, who was much exa&s;perated in con&s;equence, and would not &s;uffer him to acquie&s;ce in &s;o exorbitant a demand.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation capt. O'Brien left the Tuni&s;ian bu&s;ine&s;s, and proceeded to Tripoli, where, after much difficulty, he concluded a peace with that power upon the 4th of November, and procured the relea&s;e of the American pri&s;oners who were captu|red in the &s;hip Bet&s;ey. He left captain Jo&s;eph In|graham, the American <HI>charge des affaires,</HI> in that place, and &s;ailed from thence the 27th of Novem|ber, bringing away the remaining part of the crew of the &s;hip Bet&s;ey. On the 7th of December, in his return to Algiers, he again touched at Tunis, where he received orders from Mr. Barlow and the dey, by whom he had been inve&s;ted with di&s;cretionary powers to conduct the negociation, to demand a definitive an&s;wer from the bey of Tunis, whether he would negociate a treaty of peace with the United States upon the terms pre&s;cribed by the dey? but he found that the bey &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in the exorbitancy of his demands; and after many conferences and fruitle&s;s efforts he &s;ailed from Tu|nis, and arrived in Algiers the 3d of January 1797, where he communicated to Mr. Barlow and the dey the un&s;ucce&s;sful re&s;ult of his mi&s;&s;ion. The dey was violently enraged at the in&s;ult offered to his dignity by this rejection of his interce&s;&s;ion in the affairs of the United States, and actuated by &s;ome former animo&s;ities that &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, he i&s;&s;ued immediate orders to his ea&s;tern camp of 60,000 men to enter the Tuni&s;ian terri|tory. This army was &s;oon &s;et in motion to en|force
<PB N="85" REF="032877_0044_0FF5A867105414E70">
a compliance on the part of the bey. In their rout through the Tuni&s;ian dominions they cut off &s;ome hundreds of heads and ears, and after commit|ting great ravages upon the inhabitants, they returned to the territory of Algiers. This har&s;h expedient was adopted in order to a&s;certain the political di&s;|po&s;ition of the government of Tunis, and to de|cide whether they would &s;ubmit to the controul of the dey; for the powers relative to the American pacification, the dey expre&s;sly declared, were un|der his immediate guarantee. Capt. O'Brien, by the dey's orders, left Algiers the 14th of February, and arrived in Philadelphia the 1&s;t of April 1797.</P>
<P>The truce which Mr. Barlow concluded with the Tuni&s;ian regency, on the 15th of June 1796, for &s;ix months, expired on the 15th of December following. This truce had been obtained without any pre&s;ents, by Mr. Famin the French agent at Tunis, who had been recommended to Mr. Barlow by the French con&s;ul Herculais. Since its ex|piration the American ve&s;&s;els have been &s;ubject to capture by the Tuni&s;ian cor&s;airs, and captain O'Brien, in his publication of April 5th, 1797, &s;ays, "I now tell you candidly, that no American ve&s;|&s;el &s;hould enter the Mediterranean until our peace with all the Barbary States is fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, and publi&s;hed by the authority of the United States." But with regard to the Tuni&s;ian negociation, little apprehen&s;ion is entertained, and it is highly proba|ble that Mr. Barlow, through the powerful interce&s;|&s;ion of the dey, has already concluded a treaty with that government.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of the Algerine treaty, an univer&s;al joy diffu&s;ed it&s;elf among the American pri&s;oners, and they triumphed in the delight|ful anticipation of vi&s;iting their native &s;hores again.
<PB N="86" REF="032877_0045_0FF5A87BCF89B110">
They had long been the victims of the mo&s;t com|plicated calamities, and become familiar with the gloomy pro&s;pect of death. They were haunted with the di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions of a &s;ervitude for life, and hope, the plea&s;ing illu&s;ion that gilds the dark regions of adver&s;ity, &s;eemed fled for ever. To add to the catalogue of their mi&s;eries, the plague commenced its awful vi&s;itation; many of their companions fell a &s;acrifice to this dreadful contagion, while others invoked the friendly hand of death to terminate their &s;ufferings and de&s;pair. When intelligence of the treaty was announced, the captives indulged the animated expectation of an immediate deliverance, and the &s;udden tran&s;ition from &s;uch a dark &s;tate of de&s;pondence, in&s;pired them with the mo&s;t ineffable joy. But the fatal delays occa&s;ioned in the remittances of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums endangered the exi&s;tence of the treaty, and over|clouded the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect. In con&s;equence of the&s;e unfortunate delays, which were principally owing to the convul&s;ions in Europe, the captives were &s;till con&s;ined at hard labour, and the period of their mi&s;ery was unfortunately protracted from the 5th of September 1795, the time when the treaty was formed, till the 9th of July following, when the &s;tipulated payments were made. Mr. Barlow then paid them a vi&s;it while they were at labour, and when he announced the plea&s;ing intelligence to them, it was &s;o unexpected that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of them would believe him; but their incredulity de&s;erted them when orders were pre&s;ented for their immediate appearance before the dey; they bade an eternal adieu to the huge &s;tones of Bublywhite, and imme|diately repaired to the palace with every demon|&s;tration of the mo&s;t extravagant joy; where they were arraigned in the dey's pre&s;ence, who &s;at in

&s;tate, attended by the ca&s;&s;an aga, or prime mini&s;|ter, the aga and other officers of government. After a &s;hort pau&s;e, the head clerk pre&s;ented each captive with a <HI>Ti&s;coree,</HI> or pa&s;&s;port, and informed them they were at liberty to make immediate pre|parations for their return home. Forty-eight Nea|politans were liberated at the &s;ame time; one of whom, in a tran&s;port of joy, pro&s;trated him&s;elf be|fore the dey and ki&s;&s;ed his hands and feet; but the Americans, who were not quite &s;o &s;ervile, repaired with all expedition to the port of the marine, and embarked on board the &s;hip La Fortune, which had been chartered for them by the Me&s;&s;rs. Buckras, for the purpo&s;e of conveying them to Mar&s;eilles.</P>
<P>The original number of the Americans was now reduced to 85. Many of them died with the plague, a few with the &s;mall pox, and others with the &s;everity of the labour which had been impo&s;ed upon them. Captain Wallace of Richmond met with an untimely death as he was leaning again&s;t the banni&s;ters of an ancient building, which gave way, and he fell from a con&s;iderable height into the &s;treet, where he in&s;tantly expired. The plague raged with &s;uch violence when the captives left Algiers that five of them died within a few weeks previous to their departure; another who was attacked by that fatal malady was left behind, and many others had their con&s;titutions much injured by the di&s;order. One of them was in a &s;tate of total blindne&s;s, and another was rendered nearly &s;o. Three of them carried the marks of unmerciful treatment, in ruptures produ|ced by hard labour; &s;everal of them were render|ed incapable of gaining their living, and con&s;e|quently are objects of the benevolence of their countrymen.</P>
<P>Mr. Barlow was fully &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="88" REF="032877_0046_0FF5A88B8EFBE060">
their immediate removal from this mo&s;t wretched of all conceivable abodes, and was ju&s;tly apprehen|&s;ive that they could not be embarked without &s;ome danger of the infection. After his arrival he was mo&s;t &s;edulou&s;ly employed in effecting their delive|rance, and by his benevolence, which was ever ex|tended to the captives, their condition was render|ed more tolerable, till the final obtainment of their liberty. To this worthy character, who&s;e heart vibrated with their finer feelings of philanthropy, while his life was in imminent danger, the mo&s;t ar|dent tribute of gratitude is due, and the captives &s;peak in terms of the warme&s;t affection for his uni|form exertions in re&s;cuing them from this region of horror.</P>
<P>After preparing the nece&s;&s;ary articles for their voyage, the Americans &s;et &s;ail, with the 48 Neapo|litans, in the &s;hip La Fortune, under the command of capt. Calder, and &s;oon bade an eternal adieu to the land of bondage.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were tran&s;acting, the Alge|rines were pro&s;ecuting their piracies again&s;t vari|ous maritime powers in Europe. An attempt at ne|gociation between the "invincible militia" and Por|tugal was in&s;tituted in November 1793, and a Por|tugue&s;e frigate was di&s;patched to Algiers upon this bu&s;ine&s;s. The terms pre&s;cribed by the dey were, 1,200,000 Mexican dollars for the trea&s;ury; 600,000 dollars for the voice of the dey, and the great officers of the regency, amba&s;&s;adorial and con|&s;ular pre&s;ents, equal to what Spain gave; and the payment of 150,000 dollars for the redemption of 75 Portugue&s;e captains. With the&s;e propo&s;itions the Portugue&s;e frigate &s;et &s;ail from Algiers the 7th of November, and arrived at Li&s;bon &s;oon after. But upon further con&s;ideration the dey was not &s;atis|fied
<PB N="89" REF="032877_0046_0FF5A88B8EFBE060">
with this &s;um, and the next day he de&s;ired capt. Logie, an Engli&s;h agent, to write to Portugal that he demanded 600,000 dollars for his family and friends, in addition to what he had previou&s;ly ex|pre&s;&s;ed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above terms were &s;et forth in a letter of capt. O'Brien, dated at Algiers, the 28th of November 1793. When the American captives were informed that capt. O'Brien had publi&s;hed this exorbitant demand upon the Portugue&s;e, they were highly offended, and arraigned the precipitancy of the publication; becau&s;e &s;uch di&s;courag|ing terms would have a tendency to retard, if not total<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y fru&s;trate, their ran&s;om.</NOTE> The&s;e terms were of cour&s;e never compli|ed with, and the Portugue&s;e and Algerines &s;till continue in a &s;tate of warfare.</P>
<P>The Dutch truce expired on the 10th of December 1793. But a peace was concluded in April follow|ing, and all the Dutch pri&s;oners were liberated. The principal powers with which the Algerines are now at war, are the Portugue&s;e and the Pope. They declared war again&s;t the republic of Venice on the 26th of October 1796, the i&s;&s;ue of which we have not heard. But with France, Spain, Eng|land and America they now are at peace.</P>
<P>About the beginning of 1796, the affairs of the Danes a&s;&s;umed a very di&s;a&s;terous complexion. One of the Neapolitan crui&s;ers had taken a Dani&s;h ve&s;|&s;el freighted with 300 Turks, who were bound from the Levant to Algiers. The&s;e Turks were carried to Naples, where they were made &s;laves; which &s;o exa&s;perated the dey, that he i&s;&s;ued immediate or|ders for the capture of Dani&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and thirteen &s;ail were &s;hortly after brought into Algiers, where they were obliged to lie for four months, till the Dani&s;h government had negociated the ran&s;om o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the 300 Turks: after which the Danes were libe|rated;

but their cargoes, which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of peri&s;hable articles, were mo&s;tly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>About the beginning of 1795, upwards of 200 Cor&s;icans were captured as they were &s;eeking for co|ral off the Barbary coa&s;ts. While they were bu&s;ily employed in a number of fi&s;hing boats, under con|voy of an Engli&s;h brig<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be remembered here that Cor&s;ica was one of the <HI>pearls</HI> in his Brit&s;h Maje&s;ty's crown; but it was after|wards evacuated by the Briti&s;h.</NOTE>, two French frigates hove in &s;ight, and &s;oon after a &s;mart engagement took place between the French, and the Engli&s;h brig; but &s;he was &s;oon captured, and the Cor&s;ican boats fled for refuge to the Barbary &s;hore near Con&s;tantina, where they were all kidnapped by the Moors, and taken to Algiers, where they were made &s;laves. After they had amu&s;ed them&s;elves among the rocks of Bublywhite for about a year, Mr. North was &s;ent as Briti&s;h agent to negociate their ran&s;om, and he procured their liberty upon the payment of about 120,000 dollars, be&s;ides the promi&s;e of an armed ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Some time in September 1796, the Engli&s;h &s;ent in a French xebeck of incon&s;iderable value, lately made a prize, which di&s;plea&s;ed the dey &s;o much that he ordered her immediately out of the port. The commanders of two Engli&s;h frigates which then lay off the harbour, highly re&s;enting this piece of conduct, hauled their ve&s;&s;els clo&s;e in under the ca&s;tle on the mole, and prepared to pour a broad &s;ide into the city. When the dey ob&s;erved the&s;e preparations, he was thrown into the mo&s;t violent con&s;ternation; the &s;laves were immediately ordered to clear away the lumber in the ca&s;tle, and to get the guns in rea|dine&s;s for defence. At the &s;ame time the fleet of Admiral Jervis, con&s;i&s;ting of 25 &s;ail of the line
<PB N="91" REF="032877_0047_0FF5A88D16110C40">
was crui&s;ing off the harbour, and from this force, the dey expected nothing le&s;s than the total de&s;truc|tion of Algiers. At this critical juncture he made application to Mr. Barlow to u&s;e his influence with the Briti&s;h commanders, to di&s;&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">de them from their de&s;igns, and after di&s;tributing &s;ome pre&s;ents to a con&s;iderable amount among the officers of the fri|gates, they hauled off to a di&s;tance, and did not put their de&s;ign in execution.</P>
<P>In the beginning of June 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">5, a mo&s;t bloody and ob&s;tinate battle was fought near Cor&s;ica, be|tween an Algerine rover of 34 guns and two Nea|politan frigates of 20 guns each, in conjunction with one of the Pope's garda co&s;tas, of 10 guns and a number of &s;wivels. The action la&s;ted from ten o'clock in the morning till four in the afternoon without intermi&s;&s;ion, and the combatants were for the greate&s;t part of the time within pi&s;tol &s;hot of each other. The cor&s;air fought under the bloody flag, and rode the greate&s;t part of the time between an ince&s;&s;ant and well directed fire, which cut away almo&s;t all her rigging, and made terrible havoc among her c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew; yet the ru&s;&s;ians fought with the utmo&s;t fury and de&s;peration, and attempted &s;everal times to board their enemies; but were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. In the heat of the engagement all the officers were killed, and the captain had both his legs carried away by a chain &s;hot, as he was firing a blunderbu&s;s; yet the barbarian &s;till refu&s;ed to be taken from the deck, and died while he was giving the word of command. This lo&s;s did not in the lea&s;t intimidate the furious crew, who &s;wore they would not &s;ubmit while a &s;ingle man exi&s;ted. The Chri&s;tians di&s;played equal fury during the whole conflict, and were to a man determined either to conquer or die. Unfortunately one of the frigates
<PB N="92" REF="032877_0048_0FF5A88E9B14DC80">
which made the greate&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon the cor&s;air, blew up with a tremendous explo&s;ion, and mo&s;t of the crew peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time another di&s;a&s;ter occurred. The Pope's crui&s;er, after a gallant re&s;i&s;tance, was &s;unk by the enemy's &s;hot. The crew of the remaining frigate were then obliged to tow her away; while the cor&s;air lay like a log upon the water, with her fore and main-ma&s;ts carried away by the board, and her hull &s;o much &s;hattered that the &s;unk &s;hortly af|ter the action.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July following the American pri&s;oners &s;et &s;ail from Algiers, and on the 19th they arrived off Mar&s;eilles, where they were obli|ged to ride quarantine for 80 days; after which they were permitted to go on &s;hore at that city, where Stephen Catalon, jun. the American con&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, provided a Swedi&s;h bark for their tran&s;portation to America, and procured each of them a &s;uit of clothes, be&s;ides an allowance of 35 cents a day for their &s;ub&s;idence. Fourteen of their number enter|ed on board of an American &s;hip at Mar&s;eilles, to go on a trading voyage up the Mediterranean, and a few were detained by &s;ickne&s;s. Capt. Penro&s;e, who came with them from Algiers, went to Ali|cant at the reque&s;t of Mr. Montgomery, the Ame|rican con&s;ul who re&s;ided there, to take charge of a ve&s;&s;el intended to ply between that place and Philadelphia; but &s;he not being ready, captain Penro&s;e returned from thence in another ve&s;&s;el, and landed at Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The remainder of the captives, after a re&s;idence of 20 days at Mar&s;eilles, &s;et &s;ail for the port of Philadelphia on the 12th of November, in compa|ny with the two &s;ons of the duke of Orleans, and after a pa&s;&s;age of near three months, they arrived
<PB N="93" REF="032877_0048_0FF5A88E9B14DC80">
at Marcus Hook, where the ve&s;&s;el was detained by the ice which was then in the Delaware. On the 8th of February 1797, they were brought to Phi|ladelphia in carriages, e&s;corted by many hundreds of their fellow citizens who went out to meet them. Upon their arrival at the Indian Queen tavern, the &s;treets were &s;o thronged as to render their pa&s;&s;age difficult, and as they entered the hou&s;e, an ardent acclamation expre&s;&s;ed the &s;atisfaction of the people at their return. Tho&s;e who had friends in the city to provide for them, retired to receive their congratulations; but it has been reported by &s;ome of the captives, that tho&s;e who were not &s;o fortunately accommodated, were left entirely de&s;ti|tute to wander the &s;treets of the city, at that incle|ment &s;ea&s;on of the year, without friends, or a &s;in|gle cent to provide for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. If this be true, it reflects a di&s;honor upon the humanity of our government, that the&s;e unfortunate men &s;hould be re&s;cued from the regions of mi&s;ery to &s;tarve in a land of freedom.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t in&s;pire the brea&s;ts of the Americans with great regret and mortification, when they reflect upon the exorbitant &s;ums of money that have been expended in the negociation of the Algerine treaty, be&s;ides the annual payment to the dey of 12,000 Algerine &s;equins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The value of the Algerine &s;equin (pronounced <HI>&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">en</HI>) is 1.963 dollar; or 1 dollar 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> cents and 3 mills.</NOTE> in maritime &s;tores, according to the la&s;t article of the treaty; and their mortification will not be dimini&s;hed when they reflect, that they have now become the tributaries of a ci-devant Tur|ki&s;h &s;oldier! This additional weight to the Ame|rican taxation, which had before encrea&s;ed in a rapid progre&s;&s;ion, is not the mo&s;t comfortable re|flection,

and would almo&s;t induce one to arraign the negociation as highly impolitic, were there not a dan|ger of incurring the imputation of a want of huma|nity. It is, however, very problematical whether the advantages to be derived from the Mediterra|nean trade will ever compen&s;ate for the expenditure of the&s;e enormous &s;ums; and it &s;eems rather un|ju&s;t that the great burden of guaranteeing this trade &s;hould re&s;t upon the &s;houlders of the people, while its benefits re&s;ult to a few individuals, who ought perhaps to &s;upport this branch of commerce under the &s;anction of in&s;urance.</P>
<P>I have thought proper, in order to repre&s;ent the Algerine negociation in a more comprehen&s;ive point of view, to &s;ubjoin an e&s;timate of the pecu|niary di&s;bur&s;ements, and the &s;everal corre&s;ponden|ces that have taken place in this bu&s;ine&s;s, accor|ding to the following reports.</P>

<P>In pur&s;uance of an act pa&s;&s;ed the 21&s;t day of Fe|bruary 1795, the &s;um of 800,000 dollars was bor|rowed of the Bank of the United States, which was paid in 6 per cent. &s;tock.

<HEAD>In the execution of the bu&s;ine&s;s with which Baring and Co. have been entru&s;ted, they have com|municated to Mr. Pinckney, from time to time, every material circum&s;tance which has occurred; but as the pre&s;ent po&s;ition is extremely critical and important, they will endeavor to &s;tate as con|ci&s;e a narrative as po&s;&s;ible from the commence|ment of the bu&s;ine&s;s, for the con&s;ideration and determination of Mr. King.</HEAD>
<P>March 7, 1795. The Pre&s;ident of the Bank re|mit to Baring and Co. 800,000 dollars in certi|tificates of 6 per cent &s;tock, with orders to &s;ell the &s;ame without cau&s;ing a depre&s;&s;ion in the prices, and thus injuring the credit of American funds. The net proceeds, after deducting the u&s;ual commi&s;&s;ions, are to be held at the di&s;po&s;al of Col. David Humphreys;
<PB N="101" REF="032877_0052_0FF5A8A2CFC99488">
and we are directed to inform Col. Humphreys of the progre&s;s we may make, from time to time, in the &s;ales of the &s;tock, and al&s;o of the terms upon which remittances can be made to Cadiz or Leghorn. This contains nearly the whole of our orders, or at lea&s;t the whole of what we conceive to be nece&s;&s;ary for the information of Mr. King, in the pre&s;ent moment; the further letters from America being al|mo&s;t wholly an&s;wers to our numerous letters, and do not contain a &s;yllable of di&s;approbation with regard to our conduct, but the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>March 31. Col. Humphrey writes from Philadel|phia, that we would furni&s;h him with information, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &amp;c. directed to him at Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>April 28. We wrote very fully to Col. Hum|phreys, communicating every information relative to the probable &s;ale of the &s;tock, and the various means by which he could execute his commi&s;&s;ion through London, Cadiz, Li&s;bon, and Italy in general.</P>
<P>May 19. We wrote &s;till more fully, in an&s;wer to his letter of the 31&s;t March, wherein we offered to anticipate a con&s;iderable &s;um, on the value of the effects in our hands, for which there was no demand at the moment. We explained to him the value of the Italian coin, tho&s;e of Spain being well known; mentioning that it was ea&s;ier to procure money at Leghorn, where there was no re&s;traint, than at Ca|diz where dollars were more plentiful, but the ex|portation was exclu&s;ively in the bank of St. Charles, from whom it was difficult to obtain permi&s;&s;ion. That we could procure any quantity in London: to which we added the names of our corre&s;pondents at the different places, offering every &s;ervice in our power, direct or indirect.</P>
<P>May. 18. Col. Humphreys advi&s;es his arrival at Gibraltar.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="032877_0053_0FF5A8A4541C5C78">
July 21. We advi&s;e Colonel Humphreys that we had &s;old, 300,000 dollars:&mdash;that we were ready to pay 100,000, to his order; and if he wanted a fur|ther &s;um, we de&s;ired to be informed.</P>
<P>July 27. Colonel Humphrey directs us to pay 40,000 dollars to Mr. Deas, for Mr. Andrews, which was immediately complied with, by a credit on Hamburgh, for that value.</P>
<P>July 30. We inform Colonel Humphreys that having made further progre&s;s in our &s;ales, we &s;hould hold the whole of the value of the 800,000 dollars at his di&s;po&s;al: meaning to furni&s;h, by anticipation, the value of that part which remained at that time un&s;old, if the &s;ervice of the United States requi|red it.</P>
<P>November 28. Is the next letter from Colonel Humphreys, and the commencement of our diffi|culties;&mdash;he informs us, that he &s;hould &s;end the Sophia, for the purpo&s;e of receiving Portugal gold and Spani&s;h dollars, in London, to the amount of 650,000 Spani&s;h dollars. He further opens credit in favour of Me&s;&s;rs. Dohrman, of Li&s;bon, which from the &s;carcity of paper at the time was effected to a very trifling amount.</P>
<P>This letter was followed and confirmed by others from Colonel Humphreys, dated the 16th, 22d, and 24th December, of a &s;imilar tenor, or very nearly &s;o, and the arrival of the brig Sophia from Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>Although Col. Humphreys has not mentioned to us the rea&s;ons of this proceeding, we may impute it to the advice contained in our letter of the 19th May, and indeed the well known facility with which a &s;um of that de&s;cription could be procured in London, of Spani&s;h dollars, having our&s;elves never experienced the lea&s;t difficulty in di&s;appointments for large &s;ums.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="032877_0053_0FF5A8A4541C5C78">
December 22. We an&s;wered the&s;e letters, advi|&s;ing Colonel Humphreys of the impo&s;&s;ibility to pro|cure Portugal gold, none having been received for many years. Of the extraordinary turn which had appeared with regard to bullion, in con&s;e|quence of the immen&s;e drains upon this country, for carrying on the war, and which has finally compel|led the mini&s;ter to abandon his favorite project of a &s;econd loan to the emperor; but as the difficulty had only begun to appear, we hoped that with &s;ome de|lay, we &s;hould be able to collect the dollars for the purpo&s;e of executing the orders of Col. Hum|phreys.</P>
<P>Jan. 17, 1796. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to procure gold, and no &s;ilver arriving, we &s;ubmitted the whole of the orders and corre&s;pondence to Mr. Pinckney; when it was determined to purcha&s;e &s;uch &s;ilver as might arrive; but, at all events, to detain the Sophia, which could not be wrong, as the we&s;t|erly winds would have prevented her &s;ailing.</P>
<P>In the mean while we wrote to Me&s;&s;rs. Pari&s;h and Co. of Hamburgh, to know whether Portugal gold or Spani&s;h dollars could be obtained in that place.</P>
<P>January 19. 26&mdash;February 2, 12. Are letters we wrote to Colonel Humphreys, wherein we ac|quaint him with our pro&s;pects, from time to time, that Pari&s;h and Co. gave us rea&s;on to hope for the execution of a part of the order, but that no &s;ilver had arrived in London.</P>
<P>February 16. Having determined, with the ap|probation of Mr. Pinckney, to &s;end the Sophia to Hamburg, in con&s;equence of the encouragement of Me&s;&s;rs. Pari&s;h and Co. on applying to capt. Cran|don, he ob&s;erved that it was contrary to his in&s;truc|tions, which were to return to Li&s;bon: And as con&s;iderable doubts exi&s;ted about proceeding to

Hamburgh, Mr. Pinckney dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">d giving a po&s;i|tive order to captain Crandon, which proved fortu|nate, as immediately after advice was received from Me&s;&s;rs. Pari&s;h and Co. that the dollars they had in view had been purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, and under this date, we wrote to Colonel Humphreys, by the brig Sophia, and by the packet, acquainting him with our di&s;appointment in toto; which we accompanied, at the intimation of Mr. O'Brien, with letters of credit on Madrid and Cadiz; and, in order to fini&s;h this part of the &s;ub|ject, as a ju&s;tification for permitting the Sophia to re|turn, we &s;hould ob&s;erve, that if &s;he had been detain|tained for &s;ix months, we could not have procured one half of the quantity of Spani&s;h dollars re|quired.</P>
<P>March 1. We advi&s;ed Colonel Humphreys that we had received a large &s;um in bills, drawn from Leghorn, on the Briti&s;h government; being for mo|ney &s;ent to Algiers, and which appeared afterwards to be for the relea&s;e of the Cor&s;ican pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>March 21,&mdash;29. Are an&s;wers to letters from Col. Humphreys, relative to our accounts, chiefly dated the 27th February, and 9th March, which we do not notice, concluding that he was &s;atisfied, as nothing appears in reply to us; but as there was rea&s;on to fear the bu&s;ine&s;s could not be executed in Spain, the government there refu&s;ing a licence, notwith&s;tanding the endeavors of Me&s;&s;rs. Joyes and Sons, aided by the American mini&s;ter or re&s;i|dent.</P>
<P>April 1. We wrote to Me&s;&s;rs. Fonnereau, of Leghorn, not only to open the nece&s;&s;ary credit, but to explain to them, in a full and confidential manner, the nature and extent of our preceding di&s;appointments; reque&s;ting (with the approbation of

Mr. Pinckney and Col. Humphreys) that they would convey to Algiers &s;uch information as &s;hould &s;atisfy the dey, that the delay in paying the money did not ari&s;e from the want of funds, credit, or en|deavours on the part of the United States, but mu&s;t be &s;olely attributed to the political convul&s;ions in Europe, which had annihilated the u&s;ual channels or modes of procuring the coin for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to quote dates of letters, as there appears but one opinion on the &s;ubject, namely, "that the bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t finally be done at Leghorn, and both Mr. Pinckney and Col. Humphreys re|commend mo&s;t earne&s;tly that the information al|luded to &s;hould be conveyed to Algiers.</P>

<P>June 17. Fonnereau advi&s;e the delivery to them, on that day, of the orders from Col. Humphreys, to pay to the order of Mr. Donald&s;on, 400,000 Spani&s;h milled dollars, which they acquaint him &s;hall be immediately complied.</P>
<P>June 19. Mr. Donald&s;on acquaints Me&s;&s;rs. Fon|nereau, that he &s;hould accept the &s;um; and on a meeting between them and&mdash;, the price of the dollars, with that of Agio, was &s;ettled to the &s;atis|faction of&mdash;</P>

Humphreys: This bu&s;ine&s;s might have been completely fini&s;hed by our giving to Mr. Donald&s;on bills on you, or on Hamburg, for the remaining 260,000 dollars, which&mdash;offered to negociate for him, and to

<P>June 27. The French entered Leghorn, and Fonnereau embarked on board an Engli&s;h frigate.</P>

<P>WHEREAS a Treaty of Peace and Friend&s;hip has been concluded in the manner herein after men|tioned, by the Plenipotentiary of the United States of America and the Bey and &s;ubjects of Tripoli of Barbary; which treaty written in the Arabic lan|guage, being tran&s;lated into the language of the U|nited States, is in the words following to wit:</P>
<P>TREATY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP Between the United States of America and the Bey and Sub|jects of Tripoli-of Barbary.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 1&s;t. There is a firm and perpetual peace and friend&s;hip between the United States of America, and the bey and &s;ubjects of Tripoli of Barbary, made by the free con&s;ent of both parties, and guaranteed by the Mo&s;t Potent Dey and Regen|cy of Algiers.</P>

If any goods belonging to any nation with which either of the parties is at war, &s;hall be loaded on board of ve&s;&s;els belonging to the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arty, they &s;hall pa&s;s free, and no attempt &s;hall be made to take or detain them.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 3. If any citizen, &s;ubjects or effects be|longing to either party &s;hall be found on board a

prize ve&s;&s;el taken from an enemy by the other party, &s;uch citizens or &s;ubjects &s;hall be &s;et at liberty, and the effects re&s;tored to the owners.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 4. Proper pa&s;&s;ports are to be given to all ve&s;&s;els of both parties, by which they are to be known. And con&s;idering the di&s;tance between the two countries, eighteen months from the date of this treaty &s;hall be allowed for procuring &s;uch pa&s;&s;|ports. During this interval the other papers be|longing to &s;uch ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be &s;ufficient for their protection.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 5th. A citizen or &s;ubject of either par|ty having bought a prize condemned by the party, or by any other nation, the certificate of condem|nation, and bill of &s;ale, &s;hall be a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;|port for &s;uch ve&s;&s;el for one year: this being a rea&s;onable time for her to procure a proper pa&s;&s;|port.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 6. Ve&s;&s;els of either party putting in|to the ports of the other, and having need of pro|vi&s;ions or other &s;upplies, they &s;hall be furni&s;hed at the market price. And if any &s;uch ve&s;&s;el &s;hall &s;o put in from a di&s;a&s;ter at &s;ea, and have occa&s;ion to repair, &s;he &s;hall be at liberty to land and reim|bark her cargo, without paying any duties.

<P>ARTICLE 7. Should a ve&s;&s;el of either party be ca&s;t on the &s;hore of the other, all proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hall be given to her and her people; no pillage &s;hall be allowed, the property &s;hall remain at the di&s;po&s;ition of the owners, and the crew, protected and &s;uccoured till they can be &s;ent to their country.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 8. If a ve&s;&s;el of either party &s;hould be attacked by an enemy within gun-&s;hot of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orts of the other, &s;he &s;hall be defended as much as po&s;|&s;ible.
<PB N="122" REF="032877_0063_0FF5A8D8ABEF6FC0">
If &s;he be in port &s;he &s;hall not be &s;eized or a tacked when it is in the power of the other party to protect her; and when &s;he proceeds to &s;ea no enemy &s;hall be allowed to pur&s;ue her fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the &s;ame port within twenty-four hours after her de|parture.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 9.

And no pretence of any periodi|cal tribute or further payment is ever to be made by either party.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 11th. As the government of the U|nited States of America is not in any &s;en&s;e founded on the Chri&s;tian religion, as it has in it&s;elf no cha|racter of enmity again&s;t the laws, religion or tran|quility of Mu&s;&s;elmen&mdash;and as the &s;aid &s;tates have ne|ver entered into any war or act of ho&s;tility again&s;t any Mahomedan nation, it is declared by the par|ties, that no pretext ari&s;ing from religious opinions

<P>ARTICLE 12th. In ca&s;e of any di&s;pute ari&s;ing from a violation of any of the articles of this treaty no appeal &s;hall be made to arms, nor &s;hall war be declared on any pretext whatever. But if the Con|&s;ul re&s;iding at the place where the di&s;pute &s;hall hap|pen, &s;hall not be able to fettle the &s;ame, an amica|ble reference &s;hall be made to the mutual friend of the parties, the Dey of Algeirs, the parties hereby engaging to abide by his deci&s;ion.

<HEAD>SOIL, CLIMATE and PRODUCTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS country con&s;i&s;ts of eighteen provinces, the climate of which, along the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, is remarka|bly delightful, and the air pure and &s;erene.</P>
<P>The country of Algiers, and the &s;tates of Bar|bary in general, under the Roman empire were ju&s;tly denominated the garden of the world; and to have a re&s;idence there was con&s;idered as the high|e&s;t &s;tate of luxury. The produce of their &s;oil for|med tho&s;e magazines which furni&s;hed all Italy, and a great part of the Roman empire with corn, wine and oil.</P>
<P>The &s;oil is covered with almo&s;t a perpetual ver|dure, and is extremely fertile, particularly on the mountainous parts to the we&s;t of Tenez, Bugia, and Algiers Proper, which produce wheat and fruit in the greate&s;t perfection; and the northern parts of Treme&s;en, towards the &s;ea, abound in excellent pa&s;ture grounds, But as we advance into the coun|try, it becomes more parched and barren.</P>
<P>Though the lands are now uncultivated, through the barbarity and oppre&s;&s;ion of their government, yet they &s;till produce not only corn, wine, and oil
<PB N="133" REF="032877_0068_0FF5A8E97B95E418">
in the greate&s;t abundance, but dates, rai&s;ins, al|monds, apples, pears, cherries, plums, citrons, lemons, oranges, pomegranates, &amp;c. and plenty of roots and herbs grow in their kitchen gardens. Excel|lent hemp and flax grow on their plains; and by the report of tho&s;e who have travelled thither, the country&punc; abounds with all that can add to the plea|&s;ures of life.</P>
<P>Extreme heat is not common, and the climate is &s;o temperate that the heat of &s;ummer never dries the leaves of the trees, nor the cold of winter makes them fall; &s;o that they are con&s;tantly ver|dant. In February they begin to bud, and in May &s;hew their fruit in full growth, which is ripe in June. Their vines are very large and thick, and the bunches of grapes on them are commonly a foot and an half long. The grapes are fit to gather in June, and the figs, peaches, nectarines, olives, nuts, &amp;c. in Augu&s;t. The people find means to evade the sobriety pre&s;cribed by the Mahometan law, and make free with excellent wines and &s;pi|rits of their own growth and manufacture. The plains of Moligia produce wheat, barley and oats, two or three times a year. Their melons are of an exqui&s;ite-ta&s;te; &s;ome of which ripen in &s;ummer, and others in winter. Algiers produces be&s;ides, &s;alt-petre, and great quantities of excellent &s;alt; and lead and iron have been found in &s;everal pla|ces.</P>
<P>The country round the city of Algiers is very fertile. Country &s;eats, gardens and groves of trees are numerous. The Algerines are unacquainted with the art of pruning and grafting trees. Their gardens are not walled, but fenced round with a pe|culiar &s;pecies of thorns, which, from their prickles, and the compactne&s;s with which their branches in|terweave
<PB N="134" REF="032877_0069_0FF5A8EB080085E0">
are well adapted for that purpo&s;e. Among other rich tracts in the province of Algiers Proper, the great plain of Met<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ijah is admired for its a&s;to|ni&s;hing fertility. It is fifty miles in length, twenty in breadth, and includes many villas, fragant groves, and delightful gardens. The &s;oil produces &s;uch a profu&s;ion of the mo&s;t delicious fruits, rice, roots, and grain of every &s;pecies, that the inhabitants en|joy annually two, and frequently three crops.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>NEITHER the elephant nor the rhinoceros are to be found in the States of Barbary; but their de|&s;arts abound with lions, tigers, leopards, hyaenas, and mon&s;trous &s;erpents. The Barbary hor&s;es were formerly very valuable, and thought equal to the Arabian. Camels and dromedaries, a&s;&s;es, mules, and kumrahs (a mo&s;t &s;erviceable creature, begot by an a&s;s upon a cow) are their bea&s;ts of burden. Their &s;heep yield but indifferent fleeces, but they are very large, as are their goats, Bears, buffaloes, wild boars, porcupines, foxes apes, hares, rab|bits, ferrits, wea&s;els, moles, cameleons, and mo&s;t kinds of reptiles are found here.</P>
<P>There is a peculiar kind of animal, called the <HI>gapard,</HI> which can ea&s;ily be tamed, and is made u&s;e of for hunting like a dog. The head of it re|&s;embles that of a cat; the hind legs are longer than the fore, and the tail is finely mottled. It is &s;o apt to exhau&s;t it&s;elf in running that the hunters are obli|ged to carry it now and then on their hor&s;es, till it has recovered it&s;elf. There is al&s;o another curious animal which is between a dog and a fox.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides vermin," &s;ays Dr. Shaw, &s;peaking of his travels through Barbary, "the apprehen&s;ions we were under in &s;ome parts of this country, of be|ing

<P>But the mo&s;t &s;ingular in&s;ects are the locu&s;ts, which the Doctor in his travels de&s;cribes in the following manner. "They were much bigger than our com|mon gra&s;s-hoppers, having brown &s;potted wings, with legs and bodies of a bright yellow. Their fir&s;t appearance was towards the latter end of March, the wind having been for &s;ome time &s;outh|erly; and in the middle of April their numbers were &s;o va&s;tly increa&s;ed, that in the heat of the day, they formed them&s;elves into large bodies, appear|ed like a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of clouds, and darkened the &s;un.

Accordingly in the month following, their young brood began gradually to make their appearance, and it was &s;urpri&s;ing to ob&s;erve, that no &s;ooner were any of them hatched, than they immediately collected them&s;elves together, each of them forming a compact body of &s;everal hundred yards in &s;quare: which marching afterwards directly forward, clim|bed over trees, walls, and hou&s;es, ear up every plant in their way, <HI>and let nothing e&s;cape them.</HI> The inhabitants, to &s;top their progre&s;s, made tren|ches all over their fields and gardens, and filled them with water; or el&s;e placing in a row great quantities of heath, &s;tubble, and &s;uch like combu&s;tible mat|ter, they &s;et them on fire upon the approach of the locu&s;ts. But all this was to no purpo&s;e; for the trenches were quickly filled up, and the fires put our by infinite &s;warms &s;ucceeding one another, whil&s;t the front &s;eemed regardle&s;s of danger, and the rear pre&s;&s;ed on &s;o clo&s;e, that a retreat was im|po&s;&s;ible."</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>THESE matters are well worth the attention of an antiquary, but they are difficult of acce&s;s. The reader mu&s;t naturally conclude that the countries which were once under the dominion of the Car|thagenians, and the pride of the Phoenician, Greek, and Roman works, are replete with the mo&s;t curious remains of antiquity, but they lie &s;cattered among ignorant and barbarous inhabitants. Some remains of the Mauritanian and Numidian greatne&s;s are &s;till vi&s;ible, and many ruins which bear evidence of their ancient grandeur and populou&s;ne&s;s. The&s;e point out the old Julia Cae&s;area of the Romans, which was little inferior in magnificence to Carthage it&s;elf. A few of the aqueducts of Carthage are &s;aid to be &s;till remaining, but no ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ige of its walls. The &s;ame is the fate of Uttica, and many other renown|ed cities of antiquity; and &s;o over-run is the coun|try with barbari&s;m, that their very &s;cites are not known even by their ruins, amphitheatres, and other public buildings which &s;till remain in tolera|ble pre&s;ervation. Be&s;ides tho&s;e of cla&s;&s;ical antiqui|ty, many Saracen monuments of the mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous magnificence, are likewi&s;e found in this tract of country. The&s;e were erected under the califs

of Bagdad, and the ancient kings of the country, before it was &s;ubdued by the Turks, or reduced to its pre&s;ent form of government. Their walls form the principal fortifications in the country, both in|land and maratime. We know of few or no natu|ral curio&s;ities belonging to the States of Barbary, except its &s;alt pits, which is &s;ome places take up an area of &s;ix miles. Doctor Shaw mentions &s;prings found here that are &s;o hot as to boil a large piece of mutton in a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>The hot baths of Meereega in the neighbour|hood of the city of Algiers are al&s;o natural curi|o&s;ities. The principal one is twelve feet &s;quare and four feet deep. The water is very hot, and when it has filled the larger ba&s;on, it runs through into another of a &s;maller &s;ize, where the Jews bathe, for they are not permitted to u&s;e the &s;ame bath with Mahometans. The&s;e hot fountains are conjectured to proceed from the great quanti|ties of &s;ulphur, nitre, and other inflamable &s;ub&s;tan|ces in the bowels of the earth. To this cau&s;e like|wi&s;e have been a&s;cribed tho&s;e earthquakes, to which the whole country, and Algiers in particular, is frequently &s;ubjected.</P>
<P>The city of Algiers has few &s;ubjects of antiquity, and little that merits the attention of the curious. There are, however, upon the tower of the great mo&s;que &s;ome broken in&s;criptions; but the letters, though &s;ufficiently large to be &s;een at a di&s;tance, are &s;o filled up with lime and whitewa&s;h that they cannot be particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>

of different nations; &s;uch as Moors and More&s;|cos driven out of Catalonia, Arragon, and other parts of Spain, about the end of the &s;ixteenth century, Jews, Jani&s;aries, and great numbers of Turks, who come from the Levant to &s;eek their fortune: as well as mulitudes of Chri&s;tian &s;laves. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Berebers are &s;ome of the mo&s;t ancient inha|bitants of the country; and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be de|&s;cended from the ancient Sabeans, who came hither from Arabia Felix, under the conduct of one of their princes. Others believe them to be the de&s;cen|dants of &s;ome of the Canaanites, who were driven out of Pale&s;tine by Jo&s;hua. The&s;e are di&s;per&s;ed all over Barbary, and divided into a multitude of tribes under their re&s;pective chiefs; mo&s;t of them inhabit the mountainous parts; &s;ome range from place to place, and live in tents, or portable huts; others in &s;cattered villages; they have, never|thele&s;s, kept them&s;elves from intermixing with other nations. The Berebers are reckoned the riche&s;t of all, go better clothed, and carry on a much larger tra&s;&s;ic in cattle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hides, wax, honey, iron, and other commodities.

The name of <HI>Bere|ber</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been originally given them on account of their being fir&s;t &s;ettled in &s;ome de&s;art place. Upon their encrea&s;ing in proce&s;s of time, they divided them&s;elves into five tribes, pro|bably on account of their religious differences, cal|led the <HI>Zinhagians, Mu&s;amedins, Zene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i, Hoares,</HI> and <HI>Gomeres;</HI> and the&s;e having produced 600 fa|milies, &s;ubdivided them&s;elves into a great number of petty tribes.</P>

<P>But the mo&s;t numerous inhabitants are the Moors and Arabs, who trace their de&s;cent from tho&s;e di&s;|ciples of Mahomet, who formerly &s;ubdued this country; the former compo&s;e the great body of the inhabitants of the towns. But it may readily be &s;uppo&s;ed that among &s;uch a variety of different ra|ces, immen&s;e numbers cannot be &s;aid to belong to any particular tribe or nation whatever.</P>
<P>In this country there are many wandering bands of the&s;e Arabs, who live together in camps, and remove from one place to another as they want pa&s;ture for their herds and flocks, or as: any other accidental circum&s;tance happens to make it nece&s;|&s;ary. They &s;ometimes pay rent to landlords in corn, fruit, honey, wax, and other productions; and the dey likewi&s;e demands a tribute from them. The excellence of the climate renders this &s;imple way of living tolerable, though the tents of the&s;e people are mean, their uten&s;ils of little value, and their lodgings filthy. The family and their do|me&s;tic animals lie promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the &s;ame tents together, except their dogs, which are left as guards

<P>The cu&s;toms, language and religion of the&s;e &s;hepherds bear a &s;trict affinity to tho&s;e of Arabia. They are robu&s;t, and of a &s;warthy complexion. The men are active, the women prolific and the chil|dren healthy.

<P>When a young man of the&s;e tribes would marry, he drives a number of cattle to the hut where the parents of his mi&s;tre&s;s re&s;ide. The bride is &s;et on hor&s;eback, and led home amid&s;t the &s;houts of a croud of young people, who have been invited to the nuptial fea&s;t. When &s;he arrives at the hut of her lover, a mixture of milk and honey is given her to drink, and a &s;ong, &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, is &s;ung. She then alights, and is pre&s;ented with a &s;tick, which &s;he thru&s;ts into the ground, and re|peats &s;ome words to the following effect: <Q>As this &s;tick is fa&s;tened in the earth, &s;o am I in duty bound to my hu&s;band; as nothing but violence can remove it, &s;o death alone &s;hall force me from his love.</Q> She then drives his &s;tock to

<P>The Arabs are &s;tout, warlike, and &s;kilful hor&s;e|men. Their principal arms are a &s;hort lance and &s;cymitar, and they are likewi&s;e acquainted with the bow and the mu&s;ket. But they are &s;o addicted to robbing, that one cannot &s;afely travel through the country at a di&s;tance from the towns without a guard, or at lea&s;t a marabout or &s;aint for a &s;afe|guard. For they look upon them&s;elves to be the original proprietors of the country, and not only as di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the re&s;t of the inhabitants, but redu|ced by them to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of poverty, and in con&s;equence they make no &s;cruple to plunder all they meet by way of repri&s;al.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this country, e&s;pecially tho&s;e near the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, generally &s;ub&s;i&s;t by piracy; they are allowed to be bold intrepid mariners, and will fight de&s;perately when they meet with a prize at &s;ea.

<P>The inhabitants of the metropolis are extremely vicious; and it is a general ob&s;ervation that the more di&s;tant the people are from the &s;eat of go|vernment, the purer are their manners. Notwith|&s;tanding their poverty, they have much vivacity about them, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are of Arabic de|&s;cent, which gives them an air of contentment; and

If a Turk finds a Moor bet|ter mounted than him&s;elf, he takes the liberty of exchanging hor&s;es without leave or ceremony, and he will take apples, oranges, nuts and other arti|cles which the Moors bring to market, with as much indifference as if they were his property. The Turks have the exclu&s;ive privilege of carrying fire-arms. Such is the de&s;poti&s;m of the Turki&s;h &s;oldiers that they not only turn others out of the way in the &s;treets, but will go to the farm hou&s;es in the country for twenty days together, living on free quarters, and making u&s;e of every thing, not excepting the women. They are u&s;ed more like men of quality than private centinels. They are lodged in &s;pacious &s;quares, attended by &s;laves, and generally maintained at the public expence. The a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y of the dey is principally compo&s;ed of Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, who are called Jani&s;aries; and though their numbers are &s;mall, yet they tyrannize in the mo&s;t in&s;olent manner over the native Moors throughout the whole country. Some good qua|lities, however, di&s;tingui&s;h them, notwith&s;tanding this exce&s;s of de&s;poti&s;m. They never game for money, nor even trifles; and what cannot be &s;aid of Chri&s;tians, they never profane the name of the Deity. They &s;oon forget their private quarrels; and after the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m of re&s;entment has &s;ub|&s;ided,

They never move their turbans, but pull off their &s;lippers when they attend religious duties, or the per&s;on of their &s;overeign. They are fond of &s;triped and fancied &s;ilks. The viceroy and great men let their beards

<P>The dre&s;s of the common people is very plain; they wear a pair of linen drawers over their &s;hirt, and a loo&s;e white woolen jacket with a hood be|hind, or a mantle which is commonly black, and reaches only down to the knee, in which they wrap them&s;elves; but in &s;ummer they only wear two &s;hirts.</P>
<P>The men of fa&s;hion go more &s;umptuou&s;ly clad.

<P>The women pay more attention to the ornamen|tal part of dre&s;s than men. There is not, however, much difference between the dre&s;s of the &s;exes; the drawers of the women are longer, and in&s;tead of a turban, they wear a &s;ort of cawl on their heads. They tie their hair behind, and ornament it with jewels and other trinkets. They wear fine col|lars about their necks, bracelets about their wri&s;ts, large pendants in their ears, and curious caps on their heads. When they go abroad they u&s;ually throw over their faces a fine veil, which they fa&s;ten to their brea&s;t, and over their garments they wear an upper robe; &s;o that they are not known, but by the &s;laves that attend them.</P>

<HEAD>LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Algerines are void of all literature. The original language of this country appears to have
<PB N="147" REF="032877_0075_0FF5A90FC52853E8">
been the Phoenician; after which the Romans obli|ged them to exchange it (as they did all their con|quered dominions) for their own. The Arabs af+terwards introduced theirs, and after them the Turks. The native Moors make u&s;e of the More&s;|co; but the people of Algiers in general &s;peak a compound of Arabic, More&s;co, and the remains of the ancient Phoenician language. In the metropo|lis the Mahometans and Chri&s;tians u&s;e the <HI>Lingua Franca,</HI> a mixture of Spani&s;h, Portugue&s;e, Italian and French.

The public bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation is tran&s;|acted either in the Arabic or Turki&s;h, but common|ly the former, in which their late treaty with the United States of America is written.</P>
<P>It is curious that in conver&s;ation, the Turks tran&s;|po&s;e their nouns and verbs, in the &s;ame manner that the Greek and Latin writers have done. The Turki&s;h is a lofty language, and the Turks when they &s;peak affect a &s;ingular maje&s;ty of tone, as ex|pre&s;&s;ive of their &s;uperiority: which, however, con|&s;i&s;ts in nothing but their indolence, for they are neither men of learning, nor warriors,&mdash;a truth that the Ru&s;&s;ians have long taught them.</P>

<HEAD>GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Algiers has &s;ome appearance of a mili|tary republic, yet it is in fact the mo&s;t horrible of all monarchies in the world, and as mutable in its
<PB N="148" REF="032877_0076_0FF5A91195E6BC38">
principles as the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e differ, who happen to be in admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Algiers was formerly &s;ubject to the Grand Signior, and is &s;till under his protection; but the dey at pre|&s;ent pays no other tribute to him, than that of a certain number of beautiful Arabian hor&s;es, and &s;ome other pre&s;ents which are &s;ent thither annually. The Grand Signior formerly &s;ent a ba&s;haw, or viceroy, to Algiers, in whom the &s;overeignty was ve&s;ted; but tho&s;e officers frequently exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t tyrannical power, and exacted from the peo|ple &s;uch exorbitant taxes, as produced popular in|&s;urrections; till at length the Jani&s;aries and mili|tia grew &s;o powerful that they depo&s;ed them and e|lected others in their &s;tead; at which the Porte was obliged to connive, le&s;t they &s;hould be pro|voked to an open revolt, and entirely throw off the Turki&s;h yoke; &s;ince which time the power of the Porte has been &s;o gradually dimini&s;hed that he can do nothing here without the concurrence of the dey.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme authority of &s;tate is ve&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">el in the dey, who is an elective monarch, and his &s;ons never inherit the &s;overeignty by de&s;cent. He is elected by the divan, and is compelled to accept the reins of government under penalty of death. He &s;eldom &s;ecures his office without tumult and blood&s;hed, and often falls by the dagger of an a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in: &s;o that out of &s;ix deys that have reigned &s;ince 1700, four of them have been actually mur|dered, and a fifth re&s;igned to &s;ave his life. The ba&s;haws &s;eldom fail of forming parties among the &s;oldiers again&s;t him, and they make no &s;cruple to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him even in council, and the &s;tronge&s;t candidate then fills his place. An un&s;ucce&s;sful
<PB N="149" REF="032877_0076_0FF5A91195E6BC38">
expedition, or too pacific a conduct, &s;eldom fails to put an end to his life and government.</P>
<P>The way in which his authority is exerci&s;ed, corre&s;ponds with that by which it has been obtain|ed. When Mr. Bruce, as Briti&s;h re&s;ident at Al|giers, had occa&s;ion to vi&s;it the dey, he &s;ays he &s;ometimes found him in his hall of audience, with his clothes all be&s;pattered with blood like tho&s;e of a carca&s;e butcher. It is a very frequent amu&s;ement with him, to cau&s;e the heads of his &s;ubjects to be &s;truck off in his pre&s;ence. Mr. Bruce &s;aid that he knew of one man who was exceuted for no greater offence than becau&s;e a gun-flint was found upon him. His indictment and trial were very con|ci&s;e: "You ra&s;cal, what bu&s;ine&s;s have you with a flint unle&s;s you were going to con&s;pire again&s;t the &s;tate?"</P>
<P>The fir&s;t deys were elected by the militia; who were then called the divan, or common council; which was at fir&s;t compo&s;ed of 800 militia officers, without who&s;e concurrence he could do nothing; and upon &s;ome urgent occa&s;ions, all the officers, re&s;iding in Algiers amounting to 1500, were &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;i&s;t: but at pre&s;ent he is perhaps the mo&s;t de&s;potic prince in the world. He is abridged of no power whatever in admini&s;tration, and the divan, though they have a&s;&s;umed a very pompous title, have little el&s;e to do but to ratify his decrees. The divan is compo&s;ed of per&s;ons entirely of his own election whom he removes at plea&s;ure. Upon important occa&s;ions he &s;ometimes a&s;&s;embles the divan to receive their advice; but his only motive in this is to &s;creen him&s;elf again&s;t popular di&s;contents; for his autho|rity is unlimited, and he may either ratify or reject their deci&s;ions as he plea&s;es. When the Grand
<PB N="150" REF="032877_0077_0FF5A91321B009E8">
Signior is at war with a Chri&s;tian power, he gene|rally requires his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but he is only obeyed as the dey thinks proper.</P>
<P>The dey has a corps of body-guards called foul|acks. This is a very nece&s;&s;ary, though &s;ometimes a fruitle&s;s precaution, as any Turki&s;h &s;oldier who has the courage to murder him, &s;tands an equal chance of becoming his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Experiments of this kind are &s;ometimes made. Since the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, &s;ix private &s;oldiers entered into a con&s;piracy to kill a dey of one of the &s;tates of Bar|bary. They gave him a mortal wound in his pa|lace, and in the mid&s;t of a croud of people. He expired, exclaiming, <Q>Has nobody the courage to kill the villain?</Q> One of the con&s;pirators, the intended &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in&s;tantly a&s;cended the vacant throne, and brandi&s;hing his naked &s;cymitar, decla|red <HI>that he would do ju&s;tice to all!</HI> His five a&s;&s;ociates went about the hall to enforce the title of their new &s;overeign, and none pre&s;ent &s;eemed to give them|&s;elves any di&s;turbance about what had happened. He kept his &s;ituation unmole&s;ted, for about ten mi|nutes, till an old veteran unob&s;erved took aim at him with a mu&s;ket, and &s;hot him dead. Upon this the five others were immediately murdered. But what &s;howed the nature of the government in its proper light was the ob&s;ervation of the new dey, who &s;aid, that if the u&s;urper could have held his place for twenty minutes longer, he would have obtained the &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>The officer next in power to the dey is the Ca&s;&s;an-aga or Ca&s;&s;an-ajee, the prime mini&s;ter of &s;tate. He keeps one &s;et of the keys of the trea&s;ury, the dey another, and the aga a third, where they all attend once a month to pay the &s;oldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="032877_0077_0FF5A91321B009E8">
The officer next in power is the Aga or general of the Jani&s;aries, who is one of the olde&s;t officers in the army, and holds his po&s;t as all other officers do, at the plea&s;ure of the dey. During the time the aga enjoys his dignity, the keys of the metropolis are delivered to him. All military orders are i&s;&s;ued in his name, and the &s;entence of the dey upon any offending &s;oldier, whether capital or not, can only he executed in the court of his palace.</P>
<P>The next to the aga in dignity, is the Secretary of State, who regi&s;ters all the public acts; and af|ter him the Hojecabei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, who is a kind of chief ju&s;tice to &s;ettle di&s;putes among the Moors. This officer, and the two la&s;t mentioned, attend at the door of the dey's palace every morning about day-break, in order to ki&s;s his hand.</P>
<P>The next in dignity is the Vekelard, or rather Vikelhadge of the marine, who is the guardian of the navy, from whom all maritime orders i&s;&s;ue. He is &s;eated beneath an arch near the &s;ea-&s;ide called the <HI>&s;kiff,</HI> from which he has a full view of the tran&s;actions in the marine.</P>
<P>Below him &s;its the Baleck ba&s;haw, who is a kind of bailiff to execute his commands. He takes charge of the magazines of the marine; all naval articles are under his in&s;pection, and the keys of all the magazines in the town are entru&s;ted to his care.</P>
<P>The Hojee of the Rap has the charge of the ma|gazines of wheat in the town; under him are &s;eve|ral inferior hojees who execute his orders. No &s;lave can ri&s;e higher than this office.</P>
<P>The Warden Ba&s;haw is the next inferior officer. He is chief over&s;eer of the &s;laves, and takes care that they duly perform their duty. He has charge of the Bagnio Gallaro, the keys of which are deliver|ed
<PB N="152" REF="032877_0078_0FF5A914A6603418">
him every night by one of his under wardens who keeps the doors. He has a number of under wardens, who attend the &s;laves at their labour.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e there are 30 chiahs, or chows, a kind of high con&s;tables, who &s;it next to the aga in the divan, and in the &s;ame gallery with him. Out of this cla&s;s are generally cho&s;en tho&s;e who go em|ba&s;&s;adors to foreign courts, or who di&s;per&s;e the dey's orders throughout the realm. Next to them are a number of baleck-ba&s;haws, or elde&s;t cap|tains, who are promoted to that of chiah ba&s;haws, according to their &s;eniority. The oldack-ba&s;haws, or lieutenants, are next; who amount to 400, and are regularly rai&s;ed to the rank of captains in their turn, and to other employments in the &s;tate, accor|ding to their abilities. The&s;e by way of di&s;tinction wear a leather &s;trap, hanging down to the middle of their back. One rule is &s;trickly ob&s;erved in the rotation of the&s;e troops from one deputy to a high|er; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the right of &s;eniority; one &s;ingle in|fringement of which would cau&s;e an in&s;urrection, and probably co&s;t the dey his life.</P>
<P>The other military officers of note are vekelards, or purveyors of the army; the peys, who are the four olde&s;t &s;oldiers, and con&s;equently the neare&s;t to preferment; the foulacks, who are the next in &s;eniority to them, and are part of the dey's body|guards, always marching before him when he takes the field, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by their carbines and gilt &s;cymitars, with a bra&s;s gun on their caps; the kayts, or Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, each band of whom have the government of one or more adowars, or itenerant villages, and collect their taxes for the dey; and the &s;agiards, or Turki&s;h lancemen, 100 of whom always attend the army, and watch over the water appointed for it. To the&s;e we may add
<PB N="153" REF="032877_0078_0FF5A914A6603418">
the beys, or governors of the three great provinces of the realm. All the above-mentioned officers ought to compo&s;e the great divan: but only the 30 chiah-ba&s;haws have a right to &s;it in the gal|lery next after the dey. The re&s;t are obliged to &s;tand on the floor of the hall, or council-chamber, with their arms acro&s;s, and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, without motion; neither are they permitted to en|ter with their &s;words on. As for tho&s;e who have any matters to tran&s;act with the divan, they mu&s;t &s;tand without, let the weather be ever &s;o bad; and there they are commonly pre&s;ented with coffee by &s;ome of the inferior officers, till they are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Li&s;beros are the dey's &s;pies, who keep watch in different parts of the town, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining information of what is &s;aid or tran&s;acted. They are perhaps the mo&s;t mercenary and inhu|man &s;et of beings in exi&s;tence, and &s;uch is their &s;ervility to their &s;overeign, that they would betray even their own fathers. When they lodge informa|tion again&s;t any per&s;on, the chows are &s;ent to ar|re&s;t the delinquent, and he is puni&s;hed according to his crime.</P>
<P>The divan, or douwan, is the common council of the nation. It is an elective body, and is princi|pally compo&s;ed of 30 chiah-ba&s;haws, with now and then the mufti and cadi upon &s;ome emergencies; and on the election of a dey the whole &s;oldiery are allowed to come in and give their votes. All the regulations of &s;tate ought to be determined by this a&s;&s;embly, before they pa&s;s into a law, or the dey has power to put them in execution. But, for ma|ny years back, the divan is of &s;o little account that it is only convened out of formality, and to give a&s;|&s;ent to what the dey and his favourites have previ|ou&s;ly concerted. They, however, arrogate to them|&s;elves
<PB N="154" REF="032877_0079_0FF5A922EE110F70">
the whole power of the &s;tate, and in their edicts or national ordinances they a&s;&s;ume the pompous title of, "We the great and &s;mall members of the pow|erful and invincible militia of Algiers and of the whole kingdom, do ordain," &amp;c.</P>
<P>All cau&s;es whether civil or criminal, in which the &s;oldiers are concerned, are tried in this coun|cil; but tho&s;e between the citizens are decided before one of the chiah-ba&s;haws, and the plaintiffs and de|fendants always plead their own cau&s;es without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of attornies. The evidence of two witne&s;&s;es is always required, and he who is ca&s;t upon any trial receives a number of blows with a cudgel, and is com|pelled be&s;ides to comply with the &s;entence that has been pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>While the divan are convened the dey holds a fan of feathers in his hand, and &s;its cro&s;s-legged, after the manner of taylors, upon a large table about two feet high, covered with a &s;haggy carpet. Six of the principal chiahs are &s;eated in the &s;ame manner on his right, and &s;ix on his left. The re&s;t of the members &s;tand at both ends of the table, and form a kind of circle.</P>
<P>The method of gathering votes in this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly is perfectly agreeable to the character of tho&s;e who compo&s;e it.

<HEAD>CORSAIRS AND COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Algerines pay but little attention to agricul|ture or the improvement of their country, and their &s;ingular genius leads them &s;o much to the profe&s;&s;ion or piracy that they neglect all internal re&s;ources or advantages that might be derived from their own country. The cor&s;airs or pirates form each a &s;mall republic, of which the rais or captain is the &s;upreme ba&s;haw; who with the officers under him, form a kind of divan, in which every matter relative to the ve&s;&s;els is decided in an arbitrary way. The&s;e cor|&s;airs are chiefly in&s;trumental in importing whatever commodities are brought into the kingdom either by
<PB N="156" REF="032877_0080_0FF5A9247606D750">
way of merchandize or prizes. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t chief|ly of gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, dama&s;ks, cloths, &s;pices, tin, iron, plated bra&s;s, lead, quick&s;ilver, cordage, &s;ailcloth, bullets, cochineal, linen, tartar, allum, rice, &s;ugar, &s;oap, cotton raw and &s;pun, copperas, aloes, brazil and logwood, vermilion, &amp;c. Very few commodities, however, are exported from this part of the world: the oil, wax, hides, pul&s;e, and corn produced, being but barely &s;ufficient to &s;upply the country; though, before the lo&s;s of Oran, the merchants have been known to &s;hip off from one or other the ports of Barbary &s;everal thou&s;and tons of corn. The con&s;umption of oil, though here in great abundance, is likewi&s;e &s;o con&s;iderable in this kingdom, that it is &s;eldom permitted to be &s;hipped off for Europe.</P>
<P>The other exports con&s;i&s;t chiefly in o&s;triches' fea|thers, copper, ruggs, &s;ilk &s;a&s;hes, embroidered hand|kerchiefs, dates, and Chri&s;tian &s;laves. Some manu|factures in &s;ilk, cotton, wool, leather, &amp;c. are car|ried on in this country, but mo&s;tly by the Spaniards &s;ettled here, e&s;pecially about the metropolis. Car|pets are al&s;o a manufacture of the country, which, though much inferior to tho&s;e of Turkey both in beauty and finene&s;s, are preferred by the people to lie upon, on account of their being both cheaper and &s;ofter. There are al&s;o at Algiers looms for velvet, taffaties, and other wrought &s;ilks; and a coar&s;e &s;ort of linen is likewi&s;e made in mo&s;t parts of the kingdom. The country furni&s;hes no mate|rials for &s;hip-building. They have neither ropes, tar, &s;ails, anchors, nor even iron. When they can procure enough of new wood of form the main tim|bers of a &s;hip, they &s;upply the re&s;t from the materi|als of prizes which they have made, and thus find the &s;ecret of producing new and &s;wift &s;ailing ve&s;&s;els

from the ruins of the old. The Algerines are more formidable at &s;ea than any other nation on the coa&s;t of Barbary, and the &s;ea-faring people are held in great e&s;teem for the prizes they capture.</P>
<P>The fleet of this regency at pre&s;ent does not amount to more than ten or eleven &s;ail of the line, though they were formerly much more powerful, and in the time of Pinchinin their fleet amounted to 65 &s;ail of the line. At &s;ea they have been regarded as the mo&s;t de&s;perate and ferocious &s;et of beings in the world. But this &s;eems a fal&s;e prejudice that nations have imbibed, and according to recent accounts they are inferior in naval tactics to every nation in Europe. Almo&s;t all our late captives concur in the opinion that four American frigates, well manned and di&s;ci|plined, would be a force &s;ufficient to reduce them. Though the Turks are &s;o proud and arrogant, yet it is well known that they are no warriors. Their greate&s;t di&s;play of bravery is at the fir&s;t on&s;et, but if they meet with a &s;pirited reception from a compe|tent force their vanqui&s;hment is certain. Even the Moors, though they are an illiterate barbarous race, are &s;uperior warriors to the Turks. In their cor|&s;airs the mo&s;t &s;ervile part of the duty is a&s;&s;igned to the Moors, while the Turks &s;pend their time in &s;mo|king and in indolence, except when they come to an engagement with an enemy, when they fight with &s;mall arms and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">la&s;&s;es. We are ignorant of the naval force of Tunis and Tripoli; but it mu&s;t be evident that in this re&s;pect they are much inferior to the Algerines.</P>
<P>Since the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the independence of North America we owe the &s;ecurity of our com|merce in a great mea&s;ure to the wars that have ex|i&s;ted between the Algerines, the Portugue&s;e, and the Dutch, either of which nations is much &s;uperior

in naval &s;trength, and they have &s;o vigilantly guard|ed the entrance of the Mediterranean, that the pi|rates have &s;eldom been able to crui&s;e out into the Atlantic. Before the Algerine treaty American ve&s;|&s;els &s;eldom entered into the Mediterranean; and when they did &s;o, they derived their &s;ecurity either from forged or purcha&s;ed Mediterranean pa&s;&s;ports. A Briti&s;h &s;hip has for her protection a pa&s;s written upon a large &s;heet of parchment, which has by way of ornament &s;ome da&s;hes engraved or drawn with a pen upon the margin. The Algerines can|not read Engli&s;h, and a captain of a cor&s;air would mo&s;t probably forfeit his head were he to carry a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el by mi&s;take, as a prize into the harbour of Algiers. They have therefore adopted a &s;ingu|lar contrivance to di&s;cover whether &s;uch pa&s;&s;es are genuine. They keep a &s;tick marked with notches corre&s;ponding to the &s;hape of tho&s;e da&s;hes, that are uniformly delineated on the margin of the parch|ment. When the pa&s;s is produced the mea&s;ure is applied: &s;o that it is not difficult for the mo&s;t bung|ling arti&s;t to deceive them, who has an original pa&s;s before him, and in this manner it is &s;aid that many American ve&s;&s;els have been pre&s;erved.</P>

<HEAD>REVENUES.</HEAD>
<P>THE revenues of the dey are extremely fluctua|ting, and his income ri&s;es or falls in proportion to his opportunities of plundering his &s;ubjects, or fo|reigners; whence they are variou&s;ly computed by different authors. Dr. Shaw &s;ays, that the taxes of the whole kingdom produce yearly to the dey no more than 300,000 dollars; but he &s;uppo&s;es that the eighth part of the prizes to which he is entitled, the

property of tho&s;e per&s;ons who die without children, to whom the dey falls heir, with the pre&s;ents from foreign nations, fines and oppre&s;&s;ions, joined to the yearly contribution rai&s;ed by the government, may amount to as much more. He is be&s;ides entitled to all Chri&s;tian &s;laves, who&s;e ran&s;oms are his perqui&s;ites, which, with the cu&s;toms paid by the Engli&s;h, French and other nations, who are &s;uffered to trade with the Barbary States, will tend con&s;iderably to augment his revenue. Both the dey, and officers under him, enrich them&s;elves by the mo&s;t open acts of rapine and fraud; it is therefore no wonder to find the common people impo&s;ing upon one another, and e&s;pecially upon &s;trangers, &s;eeing they them&s;elves are impoveri&s;hed by heavy taxes and the inju&s;tice of tho&s;e who are in authority.</P>
<P>The dey draws immen&s;e revenues from his own &s;ubjects, which con&s;i&s;t in money, gold, &s;ilver, corn, cattle, and &s;uch other articles as may be mo&s;t u&s;e|ful to the Turks in Algiers. The prizes which the cor&s;airs take at &s;ea, &s;ome years equal the taxes on the people. It is from hence ea&s;y to collect that any calculation of revenue mu&s;t be extremely que&s;tionable, and it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that the dey him&s;elf is capable of giving an accurate e&s;|timate.</P>
<P>The regencies of Tunis and Tripoli acknowledge &s;ome &s;ubjection to the dey; but the only annual tribute they pay him is a cargo of butter and oil.</P>
<P>The Alcaide, with a detachment of Turki&s;h &s;ol|diers, collects all taxes within twenty miles of the city of Algiers. Beyond that di&s;tance they dey has three Turki&s;h armies of about 2000 men each, con|tinually reinforced as emergencies require, and &s;ta|tioned in different parts of his kingdom, for the pur|po&s;es of rapine and extortion. The&s;e armies are

&s;everally commanded by the ba&s;haws of Con&s;tantina, Bi&s;cara and Deetrie, at the places of their re&s;pective re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idence. They are neither actuated by ju&s;tice nor humanity; but with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e Turki&s;h oppre&s;&s;ors they not only enforce &s;ubjection to the dey, but compel the Moors to the payment of &s;uch taxes as they think proper. This mi&s;erable race of beings, who are the objects of every indignity and oppre&s;&s;ion that can be offered to human nature, are hunted like wild bea&s;ts among the mountains: tho&s;e who di&s;cover the lea&s;t reluctance in paying the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments of the&s;e ba&s;haws, or fly from the ra|pacity of their pur&s;uers, are beheaded and all their property confi&s;cated. If they have the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pi|cion that a Moor has concealed any part of his trea|&s;ure he is tortured till he makes a complete di&s;cove|ry, and many of the&s;e poor wretches who are un|able to make any di&s;clo&s;ure are tortured to death, without being able to &s;atisfy their tormentors. In this manner all gold, &s;ilver and other valuable arti|cles, are extorted from the inhabitants. Some of them, however, have courage enough &s;ometimes to attack their oppre&s;&s;ors in &s;ome of the narrow defiles of the mountains through which they are obliged to pa&s;s, where they frequently make great &s;laughter among the Turks; but generally after the fir&s;t fire they fly for refuge to the craggy rece&s;&s;es of the mountains. They make the&s;e tax gathering excur|&s;ions twice a year, and in every expedition they bring away immen&s;e numbers of heads and ears, which are &s;ent to the dey, as an evidence of the ba&s;haws' exertions in having rai&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary contributions.

<P>The Chri&s;tian &s;laves are liable to a variety of pu|ni&s;hments. They are &s;ometimes burned or rather roa&s;ted alive. At other times they are impaled. This is done by placing the criminal on the end of a &s;harp &s;take, which is thru&s;t up his po&s;teriors clo&s;e by the back-bone, till it appears above his &s;houl|ders.

took him into Syria when he was but thirteen years old. He afterwards recommended him to Khadijah, a rich widow, for her factor, in who&s;e &s;ervice he behaved him&s;elf &s;o well, that by making him her hu&s;band &s;he &s;oon rai&s;ed him to an equality with the riche&s;t in Mecca.</P>
<P>After he began by this advantageous match to live at his ea&s;e, he formed the &s;cheme of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing a new religion, or, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, of re|planting the only true and ancient one profe&s;&s;ed by Adam, Noah, Abraham, Mo&s;es, Je&s;us, and all the prophets, by de&s;troying the gro&s;s idolatry into which the generality of his countrymen had fallen, and weeding out the corruptions and &s;uper&s;titions which the latter Jews and Chri&s;tians had, as he thought, in|troduced into their religion, and reducing it to its primitive purity, which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in the wor|&s;hip of one God.</P>
<P>Before he made any attempt abroad, he rightly judged that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to begin with the conver&s;ion of his own hou&s;ehold. Having therefore retired with his family, as he had done &s;everal times before, to a cave in mount Hara, he there opened the &s;ecret of his mi&s;&s;ion to his wife Khadijah; and acquainted her that the angel Ga|briel had ju&s;t before appeared to him, and told him that he was appointed the apo&s;tle of God. Khadijah received the news with great joy: &s;wear|ing by him in who&s;e hands her &s;oul was, that &s;he tru&s;ted he would be the prophet of his nation.</P>
<P>Encouraged by &s;o good a beginning, he re&s;olv|ed to proceed, and try for &s;ome time what he could do by private per&s;ua&s;ion; not daring to hazard the whole affair by expo&s;ing it too &s;uddenly to the public.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="032877_0086_0FF5A93B41AA99538">
The next per&s;on Mahomet applied to was Abu Beer, a man of great authority among the Korei&s;h, and one who&s;e intere&s;t he well knew would be of great &s;ervice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o him; as it &s;oon appeared: for Abu Beer being gained over, prevailed al&s;o upon &s;ome of the principal men of Mecca to follow his ex|ample, who with a few more were converted in the &s;pace of three years: at the end of which time Mahomet having, as he hoped, a &s;ufficient intere&s;t to &s;upport him, made his mi&s;&s;ion no longer a &s;e|cret, but gave out that God had commanded him to admoni&s;hed his near relations; and in order to do it with more convenience and pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s, he directed Ali to prepare an entertainment, and invite the &s;ons and de&s;cendants of Abd'almo|taleb, intending then to open his mind to them. This was done, and about 40 of them came; but Abu Laheb, one of his uncles, making the com|pany break up before Mahomet had an opportunity of &s;peaking, obliged him to give them a &s;econd invitation the next day; and when they were come, he made the following &s;peech to them; "I know no man in all Arabia who can offer his kindred a more excellent thing than I now do to you; I of|fer you happine&s;s both in this life, and that which is to come; God Almighty hath commanded me to call you unto him: Who, therefore, among you will be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to me herein, and become my brother and my vicegerant?" All of them de|clining the matter, Ali at length ro&s;e up, and de|clared he would be his a&s;&s;i&s;tant; and vehemently threatened tho&s;e who &s;hould oppo&s;e him. Maho|met upon this embraced Ali with great demon|&s;trations of affection, and de&s;ired all tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent to hear and obey him as his deputy;
<PB N="169" REF="032877_0086_0FF5A93B41AA99538">
at which all the company broke out into a great laughter.</P>
<P>This repul&s;e, however, was &s;o far from di&s;coura|ing Mahomet, that he began to preach in public to the people, who heard him with &s;ome patience till he came to upbraid them with the idolatry and per|ver&s;ene&s;s of them&s;elves and their fathers: which &s;o exa&s;perated them, that they declared them&s;elves his enemies; and would &s;oon have accompli&s;hed his ruin had he not been protected by Abu Taleb. The chief of the Korei&s;h threatened him with an open rupture if he did not prevail on Mahomet to de&s;i&s;t. At this Abu Taleb was &s;o far moved, that he earn|e&s;tly di&s;&s;uaded his nephew from pur&s;uing the affair any farther, repre&s;enting the great danger of &s;uch an undertaking. But Mahomet was not to be inti|midated, and told his uncle plainly, <HI>that if they &s;et the &s;un again&s;t him on his right hand, and the moon on his left, he would not leave his enterpri&s;e.</HI> Abu Taleb &s;eeing him &s;o firmly re&s;olved to pro|ceed, u&s;ed no further arguments, but promi&s;ed to &s;tand by him again&s;t all his enemies.</P>
<P>The Korei&s;h, finding they could neither prevail by fair words, nor by menaces, tried what they could do by force and ill treatment; u&s;ing Maho|met's followers &s;o very injuriou&s;ly, that it was not &s;afe for them to continue at Mecca any longer; whereupon Mahomet gave leave to &s;uch of them as had not friends to protect them, to &s;eek for refuge el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth year of his mi&s;&s;ion, Mahomet had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his party &s;trengthened by the conver&s;ion of his uncle Hamza, and Omar Ebn al Kattab, who was at fir&s;t a violent oppo&s;er of the prophet. As per&s;ecution generally advances rather than ob&s;tructs the &s;preading of a religion, I&s;la|mi&s;m
<PB N="170" REF="032877_0087_0FF5A94ACA8705C8">
made &s;o great a progre&s;s among the Arab tribes, that the Korei&s;h, to &s;uppre&s;s it effectually if po&s;&s;ible, in the &s;eventh year of Mahomet's mi&s;&s;ion, made a &s;olemn league again&s;t the Ha&s;hemites and the family of Abd'almotaleb, engaging them&s;elves to contract no marriages with any of them; and to give it the greater &s;anction, reduced it into wri|ting, and laid it up in the Caaba.</P>
<P>The families in con&s;equence continued at vari|ance for three years; but in the 10th year of his mi&s;&s;ion Mahomet told his uncle Abu Taleb, that God had manife&s;tly &s;hewed his di&s;approbation of the league which the Korei&s;h had made again&s;t them, by &s;ending a worm to eat out every word of the in|&s;trument except the name of <HI>God.</HI> Of this acci|dent Mahomet had probably &s;ome private notice: for Abu Taleb went immediately to the Korei&s;h, and acquainted them with it; offering, if it proved fal&s;e, to deliver his nephew up to them; but in ca&s;e if were true, he in&s;i&s;ted that they ought to lay a&s;ide their animo&s;ity, and annul the league they had made again&s;t the Ha&s;hemites. To this they ac|quie&s;ced; and going to in&s;pect the writing, to their great a&s;toni&s;hment found it to be as Abu Taleb had &s;aid; and the league was thereupon declared void.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year Abu Taleb died at the age of above four&s;core; and about a month, or, as &s;ome write, three days after his death, Mahomet had the additional mortification to lo&s;e his wife, who had &s;o generou&s;ly made his fortune. For which rea&s;on this year is called <HI>the year of mourning.</HI></P>
<P>On the death of the&s;e two per&s;ons, the Korei&s;h began to be more trouble&s;ome than ever to their pro|phet, in&s;omuch that he found him&s;elf obliged to &s;eek for &s;helter at Tayef, where he applied him&s;elf to two of the chief of the tribe of Thakif, who then
<PB N="171" REF="032877_0087_0FF5A94ACA8705C8">
were the inhabitants of that place; but they receiv|ed him very coldly: and he was &s;oon afterwards obliged to depart from thence and return to Mec|ca, where he put him&s;elf under the protection of the Al Motaam Ebn Adi.</P>
<P>This repul&s;e greatly di&s;couraged his followers: but Mahomet notwith&s;tanding boldly continued to preach to the public a&s;&s;emblies at the pilgrimage, and gained many pro&s;elytes among them.</P>
<P>In the 12th year of his mi&s;&s;ion Mahomet gave out that he made his night-journey from Mecca to Jeru|&s;alem, and from thence to heaven, &s;o much &s;poken of by all that write of him.</P>
<P>This &s;tory &s;eemed &s;o ridiculous that &s;everal of his followers left him in con&s;equence, and would probably have ruined the whole de&s;ign, had not, Abu Beker vouched for his veracity, and declared, that if Mahomet affirmed it to be true, he verily believed him. Which happy incident not only re|trieved the prophet's credit, but encrea&s;ed it to &s;uch a degree, that he was afterwards able to make his di&s;ciples &s;wallow whatever he plea&s;ed to impo&s;e on them. This fiction, notwith&s;tanding its extravagance, was one of the mo&s;t artful contrivances Mahomet ever devi&s;ed, and what chiefly contributed to the rai&s;ing of his reputation to that great height to which it afterwards arrived.</P>
<P>In this year, called by the Mahometans <HI>the ac|cepted year,</HI> twelve men of Yathreb or Medina, came to Mecca, and took an oath of fidelity to Ma|homet at al Akaba, a hill on the north of that ci|ty; after which Mahomet &s;ent one of his di&s;ciples, named Ma&s;ab Ebn Omair, home with them, to in|&s;truct them more fully in the grounds and ceremo|nies of his new religion.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="032877_0088_0FF5A94C51D717C8">
Ma&s;ab being arrived at Medina, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who had been formerly converted, gained &s;everal pro&s;elytes, and Mahometani&s;m was propa|gated &s;o rapidly that there was &s;carce a hou&s;e where|in there were not &s;ome who had embraced it.</P>
<P>The next year, being the 13th of Mahomet's mi&s;&s;ion, Ma&s;ab returned to Mecca, accompanied by 73 men and two women of Medina, who of|fered Mahomet their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he readily accepted; as he was in the mo&s;t imminent dan|ger from his powerful adver&s;aries in Mecca. Out of this number Mahomet cho&s;e twelve per&s;ons, who were to have the &s;ame authority among them as the <HI>twelve</HI> apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t had among his di&s;|ciples.</P>
<P>Hitherto Mahomet had propagated his religion by fair means; &s;o that the whole &s;ucce&s;s of this en|terpri&s;e, before his flight to Medina, mu&s;t be at|tributed &s;olely to per&s;ua&s;ion. For before his &s;econd oath of fealty or inauguration, at al Akaba, he had no permi&s;&s;ion to u&s;e any force at all; nor would he &s;uffer it. And he was far from allowing it in his followers; but exhorted them to bear patiently tho&s;e injuries which were offered them on account of their faith. But this great pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s &s;eemed entirely owing to the great &s;uperiority of his oppo|&s;ers for the fir&s;t twelve years of his mi&s;&s;ion; for no &s;ooner was he enabled, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e of Medina, to oppo&s;e his enemies, than he pro|claimed that God had permitted him and his fol|lowers to attack the in&s;idels, to de&s;troy idolatry, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the true faith by the &s;word; for he found by experience, that his de&s;igns would otherwi&s;e have proceeded very &s;lowly, and he well knew that innovators, when they depend &s;olely on their own &s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gth, and can compel, &s;eldom

run much ri&s;k; from whence, &s;ays Machiavel, it follows, that all the armed prophets have &s;ucceed|ed, and the unarmed ones have failed.</P>
<P>That Mahomet had a right to take up arms for his own-defence, may perhaps be allowed; but whether he ought afterwards to have e&s;tabli&s;hed his religion by compul&s;ion is not &s;o ea&s;y to determine. Having provided for the &s;ecurity of his companions as well as his own, by the league offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive which he had now concluded with tho&s;e of Medina, he directed them to repair thither, which they accordingly did; but he him&s;elf, with Abu Beker and Ali &s;taid behind, having not yet receiv|ed the divine permi&s;&s;ion, as he pretended, to leave Mecca. The Korei&s;h, fearing the con&s;equence of this new alliance, began to think it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to prevent Mahomet's e&s;cape to Medina; and having held a council thereon, they came to a re&s;olution that he &s;hould be killed: and agreed that a man &s;hould be cho&s;en out of every tribe for the execution of this de&s;ign; each of whom &s;hould have a blow at him with his &s;word, that the guilt of his blood might fall equally on all the tribes, to who&s;e united power the Ha&s;hemites were much in|ferior, and therefore dur&s;t not attempt to revenge their kin&s;man's death.</P>
<P>This con&s;piracy was &s;carcely formed, before it came to Mahomet's knowledge; and he gave out that it was revealed to him by the angel Gabriel, who had now ordered him to retire to Medina. Whereupon, to amu&s;e his enemies, he directed Ali to lie down in his place, and wrap him&s;elf up in his green cloak, which he did; and Mahomet e&s;caped miraculou&s;ly, as they pretend, to Abu Be|ker's hou&s;e, unperceived by the con&s;pirators, who had already a&s;&s;embled at the prophet's door. They,
<PB N="174" REF="032877_0089_0FF5A94DDA4BC020">
in the mean time, looking through the crevice, and &s;eeing Ali, whom they took to be Mahomet him|&s;elf a&s;leep, continued watching there till morning, when Ali aro&s;e, and they found them&s;elves de|ceived.</P>
<P>From Abu Beker's hou&s;e Mahomet and he went to a cave in mount Thur, to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Mec|ca, where they lay hid three days to avoid the &s;earch of their enemies; which they very narrow|ly e&s;caped, and not without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of more miracles than one: for &s;ome &s;ay that the Ko|rei&s;h were &s;truck with blindne&s;s, &s;o that they could not find the cave; others, that after Mahomet and his attendants were got in, two pigeons laid their eggs at the entrance, and a &s;pider covered the mouth of the cave with her web, which made them look no further. Abu Beker, &s;eeing the pro|phet in imminent danger, became very &s;orrowful; whereupon Mahomet comforted him with the&s;e words recorded in the Koran, <HI>Be not grieved, for God is with us.</HI> Their enemies being retired, they left the cave, and &s;et out for Medina, by a by-road; and having fortunately e&s;caped &s;ome who were &s;ent to pur&s;ue them, arrived &s;afely at that city; whither Ali followed them in three days, after he had &s;ettled &s;ome affairs at Mecca.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing Mahomet did after his arrival at Medina, was to build a temple for his religious wor&s;hip, and a hou&s;e of his own accommodation.</P>
<P>After being &s;ecurely &s;ettled there, and able not only to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the in&s;ults of his enemies, but to attack them, he began to &s;end out &s;mall parties to make repri&s;als on the Korei&s;h; the fir&s;t party con&s;i&s;ting of no more than nine men, who intercepted and plundered a caravan belonging to that tribe, and in the action took two pri&s;oners. But,
<PB N="175" REF="032877_0089_0FF5A94DDA4BC020">
what e&s;tabli&s;hed his affairs very much, and was the foundation on which he built his &s;ucceeding great|ne&s;s, was the gaining the battle of Beder, which was fought in the &s;econd year of the Hegira, and is famous in the Mahometan hi&s;tory. Some reckon no le&s;s than twenty-&s;even expeditions wherein Mahomet was per&s;onally pre&s;ent, in nine of which he gave battle, be&s;ides &s;everal other expeditions in which he was not pre&s;ent. His forces he maintained partly by the contributions of his followers for this purpo&s;e, which he called by the name of <HI>zacat</HI> or <HI>alms,</HI> and the paying of which he very artfully made one main article of his religion; and partly by or|dering a fifth part of the plunder to be brought in|to the public trea&s;ury for that purpo&s;e, in which matter he likewi&s;e pretended to act by the divine direction.</P>
<P>In a few years, by the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms, (not|with&s;tanding he &s;ometimes came off by the wor&s;t)&punc; he con&s;iderably rai&s;ed his credit and power. In the &s;ixth year of the Hegira he &s;et out with 1400 men to vi&s;it the temple of Mecca, not with any intent of committing ho&s;tilities, but in a peaceable manner. However, when he came to al Hodeibiya, which is &s;ituated partly within and partly without the &s;a|cred territory, the Korei&s;h &s;ent to let him know that they would not permit him to enter Mecca, un|le&s;s he forced his way; whereupon he called his troops about him, and they all took a &s;olemn oath of homage to him, and he re&s;olved to attack the city; but tho&s;e of Mecca &s;ending Arwa Ebn Ma|&s;ud, prince of the tribe of Thakif, as their amba&s;|&s;ador, to de&s;ire peace, a truce was concluded be|tween them for ten years, by which any per&s;on was allowed to enter into a league either with Ma|homet, or with the Korei&s;h, as he thought fit.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="032877_0090_0FF5A94F5F2C1270">
It may not be improper, in order to &s;hew the in|conceivable veneration and re&s;pect the Mahometans by this time had for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their prophet, to mention the account which the above mentioned amba&s;&s;ador gave the Korei&s;h of their behaviour, at his return. He &s;aid he had been at the courts both of the Ro|man emperor and the king of Per&s;ia, and never &s;aw any prince &s;o highly re&s;pected by his &s;ubjects as Mahomet was by his companions: for, whenever he made the ablution, in order to &s;ay his prayers, they ran and catched the water that he had u&s;ed; and whenever he &s;pit they immediately liked it up, and gathered every hair that fell from him with great &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh year of the Hegira, Mahomet be|gan to think of propagating his religion beyond the bounds of Arabia; and &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to the neigh|bouring princes, with letters to invite them to Ma|hometani&s;m. Nor was this project without &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. Kho&s;ru Parviz, then king of Per&s;ia, re|ceived his letter with great di&s;dain, and tore it in a pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ending away the me&s;&s;enger very abrupt|ly: which when Mahomet heard, he &s;aid <HI>God &s;hall tear his kingdom.</HI> And &s;oon after a me&s;&s;enger came to Mahomet from Badhon king of Yaman, who was a dependent on the Per&s;ians, to acquaint him that he had received orders to &s;end him to Kho&s;ru. Mahomet put off his an&s;wer till the next morning, and then told the me&s;&s;enger it had been revealed to him that night that Kho&s;ru was &s;lain by his &s;on Shiruyeh; adding, that he was well a&s;&s;ured his new religion and empire should ri&s;e to as great a height as that of Kho&s;ru; and therefore bid him ad|vi&s;e his ma&s;ter to embrace Mahometani&s;m. The me&s;&s;enger being returned, Badhan in a few days received a letter from Shiruyeh, informing him of

his father's death, ordering him to give the pro|phet no further di&s;turbance. Whereupon Bad|han and the Per&s;ians with him turned Mahome|tans.</P>
<P>The emperor Hera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lius, as the Arabian hi&s;tori|ans a&s;&s;ure us, received Mahomet's letter with great re&s;pect, laying it on his pillow, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the bearer honorably. And &s;ome pretend that he would have profe&s;&s;ed this new faith, had he not been afraid of lo&s;ing his crown.</P>
<P>Mahomet wrote to the &s;ame effect to the king of Ethiopia, and to Mohawkas, governor of Egypt, who gave the me&s;&s;enger a very favorable reception, and &s;ent &s;everal valuable pre&s;ents to Mahomet, and among the re&s;t two beautiful girls, one of which, named Mary, became a great favorite with him. He al&s;o &s;ent letters of the like purport to &s;eve|ral Arab princes: particularly one to al Hareth Ebn Abi Shamer king of Gha&s;&s;ean, who returning for an&s;wer that he would go to Mahomet him&s;elf, the prophet &s;aid, <HI>May his kingdom peri&s;h;</HI> another to Hawdha Ebn Ali, king of Yamana, who was a Chri&s;tian, and, having &s;ome time before profe&s;&s;ed I&s;lami&s;m, had lately returned to his former faith; this prince &s;ent back a very rough an&s;wer, upon which Mahomet cur&s;ing him, he died &s;oon after: and a third to al Mondar Ebn Sawha, king of Bah|rein, who embraced Mahometani&s;m, and all the Arabs of that country followed his example.</P>
<P>The eighth year of the Hegira was a very fortu|nate year to Mahomet.

And &s;oon after the prophet &s;ent 3000 men again&s;t the

Grecian forces, to revenge the death of one of his amba&s;&s;adors, who, being &s;ent to the governor of Bo&s;ra on the &s;ame errand as tho&s;e who went to the above-mentioned princes, was &s;lain by an Arab, of the tribe of Gha&s;&s;an, at Muta, a town in the terri|tory of Balka in Syria, near which they encounter|ed. The Grecians being va&s;tly &s;uperior in number (for, including the auxiliary Arabs, they had an army of 100,000 men) the Mahometans were re|pul&s;ed in the fir&s;t attack, and lo&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ively three of their generals, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Zeid Ebn Haretha Maho|met's freedman, Jaafar the &s;on of Abu Taleb, and Abdallah Ebn Rawaha: but Khaled Ebn al Wa|lid, &s;ucceeding to the command, overthrew the Greeks with great &s;laughter, and brought away abundance of rich &s;poil; on occa&s;ion of which Ma|homet gave him the title of <HI>Seif min &s;oyuf Allah,</HI> "one of the &s;words of God."</P>
<P>In this year Mahomet took the city of Mecca, the inhabitants whereof had broken the truce con|cluded on two years before. For the tribe of Beker, who were confederates with the Korei&s;h, attacking tho&s;e of Khozaah, who were allies of Mahomet, killed &s;everal of them, being &s;upported in the acti|on by a party of the Korei&s;h them&s;elves.

<P>Mahomet immediately gave orders for prepara|tions to be made, that he might &s;urprize the Mec|cans while they were unprovided to receive him: in a little time he began his march thither; and by

About 28 of the idolaters were killed by a party under the command of Khaled; but this happened contrary to Mahomet's orders, who, when he en|tered the town, pardoned all the Korei&s;h on their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, except three men and one woman who were put to death, the re&s;t obtaining pardon on their embracing Mahometani&s;m.</P>
<P>The remainder of this year Mahomet employed in de&s;troying the idols in and about Mecca, &s;ending &s;everal of his generals on expeditions for that pur|po&s;e, and to invite the Arabs to I&s;lami&s;m: where|in it is no wonder if they now met with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The next year being the ninth of the Hegira, the Mahometans call <HI>the year of emba&s;&s;ies:</HI> for the A|rabs had been hitherto expecting the i&s;&s;ue of the war between Mahomet and the Korei&s;h: but as &s;oon as that tribe, the principal of the whole nation, and the genuine de&s;cendants of I&s;hmael, who&s;e prerogatives none offered to di&s;pute, had &s;ubmitted, they were &s;a|tisfied that it was not in their power to oppo&s;e Ma|homet; and therefore began to come into him in great numbers, and to &s;end emba&s;&s;ies to make their &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to him, both to Mecca, while he &s;taid there, and al&s;o to Medina, whither he returned this year. Among the re&s;t, five kings of the tribe of Hamyar profe&s;&s;|ed Mahometani&s;m, and &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to notify the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In the tenth year, Ali was &s;ent into Yaman to propagate the Mahometan faith there, and, as it is &s;aid, converted the whole tribe of Hamdan in one day. Their example was quickly followed by all
<PB N="180" REF="032877_0092_0FF5A95FCC84BA28">
the inhabitants of that province, except only tho&s;e of Najran, who, being Chri&s;tians, cho&s;e rather to pay tribute.</P>
<P>In the eleventh year Mahomet died; thus was Mahometani&s;m e&s;tabli&s;hed, and idolatry rooted out even in Mahomet's time, throughout all Arabia, except only Yamana, where Mo&s;eilama, who &s;et up al&s;o for a prophet as Mahomet's competitor, had a great party, and was not reduced till the kalifat of Abu Beker, and the Arabs being then united in one faith, and under one prince, found them&s;elves in a condition of making tho&s;e conque&s;ts, which ex|tended the Mahometan faith over &s;o great part of the world.</P>
<P>The mo&s;que which contains Mahomet's tomb, &s;tands nearly in the center of Medina, which, in con&s;equence, is called the <HI>mo&s;t holy city.</HI> It is a magnificent &s;tructure, &s;upported by 400 &s;tately co|lumns, and lighted up with 300 &s;uperb lamps of &s;u|perior lu&s;tre, which are kept continually burning. It has a &s;mall tower covered with plates of &s;ilver, and the floor is covered with a cloth of gold. It is more vi&s;ited than any city in the world except Mec|ca. Mahomet's coffin &s;tands under the cupola. It has long been the vulgar opinion that this coffin is made of &s;teel, and &s;u&s;pended in the air by the pow|er of two magnets, but this notion is erroneous, and has long ago been exploded. The tomb lies expo|&s;ed to view from the middle to the bottom of the dome, and is &s;urrounded by a &s;mall wall, which is pierced with windows &s;enced with &s;ilver grates. The in&s;ide is adorned with precious &s;tones of im|men&s;e value, e&s;pecially on that part of the cupola which is over the head of the prophet. Over his feet is placed a golden cre&s;cent of exqui&s;ite work|man&s;hip, and &s;parkling with the mo&s;t co&s;tly bril|liants.
<PB N="181" REF="032877_0092_0FF5A95FCC84BA28">
A canopy of the mo&s;t elegant embroidery is extended above, and over the coffin is thrown a rich pall of gold and &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue, which are an|nually &s;ent thither by the ba&s;haw of Egypt, by or|der of the Grand Signior, and with the greate&s;t magnificence. It is commonly carried upon the back of a &s;tately camel, and when the precious gift is taken off, the bea&s;t is no longer u&s;ed in &s;er|vile drudgery.</P>
<P>The place where the coffin lies, is &s;upported by pillars of black marble, and encompa&s;&s;ed with a balu&s;trade of &s;ilver, hung with &s;uch a number of bur|ning lamps, that the &s;moke darkens the place. The cupola is hung with white and red dama&s;k, and has the&s;e words embroidered upon it in Arabic letters of gold, <HI>God is God, and Mahomet is his prophet.</HI> The place is a hundred paces long and ninety broad; it has two gates and a vaulted nave. The concour&s;e of pilgrims that re&s;ort to this dome is a&s;toni&s;hing, and every Mu&s;&s;ulman is bound by his religion to vi&s;it this tomb at lea&s;t once in his life; after which he is for ever regarded as a &s;aint.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t article of the Mahometan religion is that <HI>there is no God but the true God, and Mahomet is his apo&s;tle.</HI> The Alcoran enjoins the belief of angels; and teaches that they are pure and &s;ubtle bodies, that there is no di&s;tinction of &s;exes among them, and that they do not propagate their &s;pe|cies that they have various forms and offices; that &s;ome adore God in different po&s;tures, and others &s;ing prai&s;es to him or intercede for mankind.</P>
<P>Mahomet named to devil <HI>Eblis</HI> from his de&s;pair. He was one of the angels called <HI>Azazil,</HI> who are in God's immediate pre&s;ence, and he fell for refu&s;ing to pay homage to Adam at God's command. The Mahometans believe in a &s;ubordinate race of an|gels

<P>The next article of the Mahometan faith is the doctrine of the re&s;urrection; but the time is known to none but God alone.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;hort account of the principal cities. The city of AL|GIERS. Its origin, &s;ituation, hou&s;es, water, public build|ings, bagnios, &s;treets, gates, walls, mole, ca&s;tles, and fortifications.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE are few towns of any con&s;equence, even along the &s;ea-coa&s;ts; though when &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively under the dominion of Carthage and Rome, it abounded with populous cities. All the &s;ea-port towns, except the metropolis, are thinly peopled; tho&s;e in the interior part of the country &s;till more &s;o, and they are inhabited by a haughty robu&s;t people, who trade into Biledulgerid and the country of the blacks.</P>
<P>BONA is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame place with the antient Hippo, a &s;ea-port built by the ancients. It was formerly the capital of the province of Bona. It lies on the Mediterranean &s;ea, and there is a co|ral fi&s;hery near it. It is a town of no importance, and of &s;lender population. In this part of the world, elegant architecture has, for many centu|ries, been utterly forgotten or de&s;pi&s;ed. The buil|dings of Bona, as every where el&s;e, are therefore mean. It is expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of the Arabs. The name of this people is u&s;ed by travellers in a very indefinite manner. Algiers is at the di&s;tance of &s;ome hundreds of leagues from Arabia: but as this part of Africa was formerly conquered by that na|tion,
<PB N="185" REF="032877_0094_0FF5A867F9C171210">
under the banners of Maho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, the name is &s;till applied to a race of tawny and independent barbarians, who wander in gangs about the country, and unite the double profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;hepherd and a robber. Bona was formerly a magnificent city. Its grandeur is now only to be traced in the ruins of a mona&s;tery. It has a fortre&s;s, and a garri&s;on of three hundred Turks, as the&s;e banditti chu&s;e to call them|&s;elves; a Turk being the mo&s;t reputable character in that country. The&s;e adventurers however are not Turks, but the &s;weepings of all nations blended together. They are commanded by an aga, who is likewi&s;e governor of the town. Bona was taken by Charles V. in his expedition to Tunis, but was not long after recovered by its former ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>CONSTANTINA is &s;ituated on the river Sef Gomar, forty-eight miles from the &s;ea-coa&s;t. It re|ceived its pre&s;ent name from that of a prince&s;s, the daughter of the emperor Con&s;tantine, to whom it is indebted for its magnificence. The &s;ituation is on a penin&s;ula, difficult of acce&s;s, except towards the &s;outh-we&s;t. It is one mile in circumference, well fortified, and contains many fragments of ancient architecture. In particular there is a part of no|ble bridge; and near it is a large &s;ubterraneous aqueduct, which terminates in a ca&s;cade&punc; State cri|minals are &s;ometimes precipitated down this place, and da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the rocks at its bottom. A bey re&s;ides here, and has under his command three hundred Turki&s;h hor&s;e, and one thou&s;and five hundred Moori&s;h &s;oldiers. The inhabitants of Con|&s;tantina are &s;aid to be opulent and haughty. This city was formerly the re&s;idence of a race of kings who governed the province of Con&s;tantina, of which it is the metropolis; but in the year 1520, the
<PB N="186" REF="032877_0095_0FF5A972EF804358">
whole territory<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> was conquered by Barbaro&s;&s;a, that di&s;tingui&s;hed tyrant, who annexed it to the govern|ment of Algiers. Some &s;plendid ruins exi&s;t in the vicinity of Con&s;tantina. Upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from it, are the traces of a Roman colony, anciently called Colo. It is &s;ituated on a high rock, and has a garri&s;on. Adjoining to it is a French factory, to which the Moors bring hides, wax, and wool, for &s;ale. At no great di&s;tance are the remains of the ancient city of Stora. It is &s;aid that the mountainous part of this te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">troy is inha|bited by a hardy people, who can rai&s;e forty thou|&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ighting men.</P>
<P>GIGERI is &s;ituated about fifteen miles from Bona. It contains about fifteen hundred hou&s;es, and the inhabitants are very poor. It is defended by a fort and a &s;mall garri&s;on. The natives of this part of the country are independent and barbarous. They retire, when circum&s;tances require it, to in|acce&s;&s;ible fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, and &s;et the dey of Algiers at defiance. Ships, when wrecked on this coa&s;t, are plundered, and the crews are treated with the ut|mo&s;t &s;avagen&s;s. In this re&s;pect, however, the natives of the territory of Gigeri cannot differ much for the wor&s;e from the re&s;t of their countrymen; nor is the practice peculiar to Barbary. Scenes of the &s;ame kind are frequently acted with impu|nity, on the coa&s;t of Cornwall, and other mari|time counties of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a &s;tory of an Engli&s;h par&s;on, who&s;e con|gregation, during the time of divine &s;ervice, heard of a &s;hipwreck.

<P>BUGIA was formerly the capital of a kingdom of the &s;ame name. It &s;tands at the mouth of the river Major, or Zinganor, about twenty leagues to the ea&s;tward of Algiers. It is little better than a heap of ruins; a de&s;cription which applies to al|mo&s;t every town in that part of the world. It has three ca&s;tles, two at the port, and one upon a rock, at a &s;mall di&s;tance behind them. In the year 1671, a Briti&s;h admiral took or de&s;troyed, in this harbour, nine Algerine &s;hips of war. It is ex|tremely &s;eldom that an admiral has been charged with &s;uch a laudable commi&s;&s;ion,</P>
<P>STESSA, or STEFFA, is &s;ituated in a fertile valley, &s;ixty miles to the &s;outh of Bugia, and fif|teen miles from the &s;ea. It exhibits only the me|lancholy ruins of its former magnificence, con|taining about three hundred mi&s;erable families.</P>
<P>TEBEF was formerly a flouri&s;hing city, but is at pre&s;ent extremely reduced. ZAMOURA is in the &s;ame condition. It is defended by a fort.</P>
<P>COUCO was once the metropolis of a kingdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame name. Its &s;overeigns were in the habit of forming alliances with the court of Spain. For this rea&s;on the Algerines, in the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, ravaged the whole coun|try,
<PB N="188" REF="032877_0096_0FF5A974795A5B98">
and de&s;troyed every town in it. The inhabi|tants have &s;till &s;upported their independence, by taking refuge in the mountainous parts of the coun|try, which are &s;aid to be very fertile; but the Al|gerines prevent them from holding any intercour&s;e with foreign nations.</P>
<P>BISCARA has a fort and garri&s;on. One of the chief employments of the people here is to catch and tame lions, tigers, and other bea&s;ts of prey, which they carry for &s;ale to Algiers.</P>
<P>NECANZ is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant towns in Barbary. It is watered by an agreeable river, who&s;e banks are adorned with a variety of beauti|ful trees. The town contains a magnificent mo&s;que and a college for the education of Mahometan &s;tu|dents.</P>
<P>ORAN is &s;ituated about two hundred and fifty miles we&s;t of Algiers. It lies partly on a plain, and partly on the a&s;cent of a hill. It is a mile and half in circumference and tolerably fortified. But it is unfortunately commanded by &s;ome of the neighbouring eminences; &s;o that a garri&s;on of ten or twelve thou&s;and men is nece&s;&s;ary to defend it with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t a &s;kilful enemy. As the Spa|ni&s;h coa&s;ts and merchant &s;hips had &s;uffered much from the cor&s;airs of this port, Ferdinand king of Spain determined to attempt its reduction. For this purpo&s;e he tran&s;ported into Africa an army, un|der the command of his prime mini&s;ter cardinal Xi|menes, who maintained a corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of the people of Oran; and when the Moors &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lied out to attack the Spani&s;h army, their perfidious countrymen &s;hut their gates again&s;t them, Xime|nes
<PB N="189" REF="032877_0096_0FF5A974795A5B98">
killed four thou&s;and of the barbarians, and &s;et at liberty twenty thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;laves. The Algerines, during almo&s;t two hundred years, made frequent and un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to recover the town. At la&s;t, in 1708, they retook it. In June 1732, a Spani&s;h army was di&s;embarked not far from Oran. The Turki&s;h commander, his troops, and the inhabitants were &s;eized with a panic, and abandoned their fortifications without much re&s;i&s;t|ance. The victors found in the place an hundred and forty-&s;ix pieces of cannon, be&s;ides mortars, and at lea&s;t fifty &s;hip loads of provi&s;ions. This latter &s;up|ply contributed much to the pre&s;ervation of their new conque&s;t. Without it they mu&s;t have run the greate&s;t hazard of peri&s;hing in the mid&s;t of &s;uc|ce&s;s; as a tempe&s;t, which la&s;ted for &s;everal days, cut off all intercour&s;e between the army upon &s;hore, and the fleet at &s;ea. The Moors not long after attacked the Spaniards with great fury, but were finally repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter on both &s;ides. The greate&s;t part of this town has lately been laid in ruins by an earthquake; &s;ince which it has been evacuated by the Spaniards, and left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Turks. From the&s;e ruins the dey of Algiers has lately exported great quantities of white &s;tone for the purpo&s;e of building his new mo&s;que.</P>
<P>TREMESEN was formerly the capital town of a kingdom of that name. It is &s;ituated ninety miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Oran, &s;urrounded by a &s;trong wall and well fortified. It has five gates with draw|bridges before them, and a ca&s;tle containing hand|&s;ome barracks for the Jani&s;aries who are in garri&s;on. Treme&s;en while a metropolis was a &s;plendid city. It contained one hundred and fifty mo&s;ques, and

one hundred and &s;ixty public baths. Since it cea|&s;ed to be the &s;eat of an independent government, it has fallen into ruins and de&s;olation. The mo&s;ques are reduced to eight, and its public baths to four. The inhabitants are extremely indigent.</P>
<P>MOSTAGAN &s;tands fifty miles ea&s;t of Oran. This town is built in the form of a theatre open|ing to the &s;ea, and &s;urrounded on every other &s;ide with rocks that hang over it. The ruins of an old Moori&s;h ca&s;tle &s;tands in a &s;pace between the rocks, and there a &s;trong &s;tone wall towards the port, with a modern built ca&s;tle, garri&s;oned by a number of Turks. The citadel is erected upon the &s;ummit of one of rocks, and commands both city and territory. The haven is commodi|ous, and the town is well &s;upplied with water. The neighbouring mountains are inhabited by a people called Magarabas, who live in tents, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a great number of flocks. There is a hand&s;ome mo&s;que in this town.</P>
<P>TENEZ is &s;ituated about one hundred miles to the ea&s;tward of Oran, twenty miles ea&s;t of Mo&s;ta|gan, and at a league di&s;tant from the &s;ea, where it has a convenient port. There is a ca&s;tle that was once a royal palace, and in which the go|vernor re&s;ides. The fortifications are &s;trong, the garri&s;on numerous, and the neighbouring territory fertile.</P>
<P>SERCELLI lies between Tenez and Algiers, about twenty-four miles to the we&s;tward of the lat|ter. It is defended by a Turki&s;h garri&s;on, and has a port which will only admit of &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els

<HEAD>Its Origin.</HEAD>
<P>THE names of the original founders of this city have never been &s;atisfactorily a&s;certained. The ac|counts tran&s;mitted to us by hi&s;torians are involved in much doubt and uncertainty, and its foundation has been a&s;cribed to various princes generally of Roman extraction.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of Strabo, however, &s;eems the mo&s;t authentic. In his account of <HI>Mauritania Cae|&s;arien&s;is</HI> he informs us, that there was formerly an ancient city on the Mediterranean known by the name of Jol, which was founded by Juba the father of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olemy, and &s;on of Juba the fir&s;t king of that name in Mauritania. It is &s;ituated, according to him, about the thirty-&s;eventh degree of north lati|tude, and has a &s;mall i&s;land in the harbour; and as there is no other place upon the Mediterranean thus circum&s;tanced, it may be pre&s;umed that the ancient city of Jol is the &s;ame as that of Algiers.</P>
<P>Juba was taken pri&s;oner in the wars between Pom|pey and the Cae&s;arian party, and carried to Rome, where he was ordered to be educated. He &s;oon ac|quitted him&s;elf &s;o well in his &s;tudies, that Augu&s;|tus not only gave him his liberty, but married him to the beautiful Silene, the daughter of Mark An|thony and Cleopatra, and re&s;tored him his father's exten&s;ive kingdom of Mauritania, which at that time included the kingdoms of Morocco, Fez, Treme&s;en, Oran, Tunis, Algiers and Bugia. As
<PB N="192" REF="032877_0098_0FF5A9778A1DF358">
a grateful acknowledgement for &s;o &s;ignal a favour, he gave the city of Jol the name of Jol Cae&s;area, and as he conferred a new name upon this city in parti|cular, in order to perpetuate the remembrance of his noble friend, we may pre&s;ume it was anciently one of the mo&s;t important cities in Mauritania.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the &s;eventh century, the Mahometan Arabs over-ran all Mauritania; and as they &s;eemed to have a particular hatred to the works, as well as the names of the Romans which they aboli&s;hed, they called this city Algezair or ra|ther Al Jezier, or Al-Jezerah, an Arabic word which &s;ignifies <HI>belonging to an i&s;land,</HI> becau&s;e there was an i&s;land before it, which is now joined to it by a mole, and forms one of the &s;ides of the harbour. The Turks call is <HI>Al Jezeire Al Gazie,</HI> i. e. Algiers the warlike, and in their public letters and records <HI>Al Je-Zeire,</HI> i. e. the i&s;land of the we&s;t, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from a city of the &s;ame name near the Dar|danelles.

It is &s;ituated at the 36th degree 49th minute of North Latitude, and the 77th degree 37th minute of Ea&s;t Longitude from Philadelphia, and lies nearly in the &s;ame latitude with the &s;outhern boundary of Virginia in the United States. It is built on the de|clivity of a mountain by the &s;ea-&s;ide, facing the north, on a bay of the Mediterranean &s;ea. The hou&s;es ri&s;e gradually from the &s;ea-&s;hore, in the form of an amphitheatre, and terminate nearly in a point towards the &s;ummit of the mountain. The town,

with its mo&s;ques, ca&s;tles, and other public build|ings, has a beautiful appearance at a di&s;tance when approaching from the water, and when fir&s;t di&s;co|vered looks like the top-&s;ail of a &s;hip.</P>

<HEAD>Hou&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ides of the hou&s;es are white, and in con&s;e|quence at a di&s;tance one would take it to be a place where they bleach linen. The roofs are flat; &s;o that the people can vi&s;it each other, at a con&s;idera|ble di&s;tance without going into the &s;treets. Where the hou&s;es are of an unequal height, there is always a communication by a ladder. As they are open at top it is ea&s;y for any one to enter them, but theft and robbery are &s;carcely ever known; for if a &s;tranger is apprehended in a hou&s;e without having previou&s;ly &s;ent in his name, he &s;eldom e&s;capes capital puni&s;hment. The tops of the hou&s;es are paved with a kind of brick or tile, and a brick wall is built up about brea&s;t high to prevent per&s;ons from falling. Above the&s;e, &s;ummer hou&s;es are erected, and as there are no &s;quares, gardens, or public walks in the whole city, the inhabitants re|pair to the&s;e places after their bu&s;ine&s;s is fini&s;hed, for the purpo&s;e of recreation, and the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing their cor&s;airs bring in prizes. One hou&s;e ri&s;es above another in &s;uch a manner that they do not hinder each other's pro&s;pect towards the &s;ea. They are &s;quare and built of &s;tone and bricks, with a &s;quare court in the middle; around this court is a double range of galleries, one above the other, and both &s;upported by columns. The hou&s;es are in general three &s;tories high, and con|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in five or &s;ix families; and &s;uch is their &s;ingular

prediliction for white, that all the out&s;ides and in|&s;ides of their hou&s;es, mo&s;ques and public buildings, are whitewa&s;hed once a year. Their number is computed to be about 15000. Their rooms are pa|ved with &s;quare tiles or bricks of &s;everal colours neatly joined together. The inward rooms have no light but what they receive from the gates, which are large, and reach up to the ceiling. Tho&s;e fronting the &s;treets have &s;ome windows, in which are fixed round cro&s;s bars of iron four or five inches a&s;under, but they have no panes of gla&s;s; &s;o that they re&s;emble pri&s;ons rather than hou&s;es. They have no chimnies, but make their fires in earthen pots, commonly placed near the door to let out the &s;moke, which is apt, however, to &s;ully their walls. Their hou&s;ehold furniture con&s;i&s;ts of a few earthen pots, platters, &s;poons, ladles, wood|en trunks, and a mat and two quilts laid on the floor, which &s;erves them for a bed.</P>

<HEAD>Water.</HEAD>
<P>THEY have neither &s;prings nor wells in the whole city; and till the la&s;t century their only &s;upply was rain water, when a Moor who had been driven from Spain con&s;tructed two aqueducts, by which they are now &s;upplied from a &s;pring which ri&s;es out of a hill about 1700 paces from the city, near the place where Charles V. pitched his tent in 1541. Since which time aqueducts have been formed from &s;everal other &s;prings in the country; and the water is plentifully conveyed into the city by con|duits or pipes under ground, which &s;upply upwards of 150 fountains; at each of which a bowl is fa&s;|tened for the u&s;e of pa&s;&s;engers. The water which
<PB N="195" REF="032877_0099_0FF5A98B8A264C10">
falls to the ground runs off through &s;mall holes in the &s;treets near each fountain, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into common &s;ewers, through which the filth of the city is conveyed away. All the&s;e pipes di&s;|charge them&s;elves into the common re&s;ervoir at the end of the mole, where the &s;hips take in their wa|ter.

<P>THERE are ten great mo&s;ques and fifty &s;maller ones, which have a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">iking effect. The dey's new mo&s;que was begun about the year 1790, and &s;tands upon the ground that was formerly occupied by the Bagnio Cedimo. It is 60 by 40 feet, three &s;tories high, and &s;upported by pillars of white marble imported from Genoa. The walls are of white &s;tone from the ruins of Oran, and the Ame|rican &s;laves were generally employed on Friday in carrying them from the mole up to the mo&s;que.</P>
<P>Near this mo&s;que &s;tands the Logger Ba&s;tion, the place of execution for Turks and Coulolies.</P>
<P>The &s;eraglio of the dey's favorite wife is the mo&s;t &s;uperb edifice in the city.

<P>The dey's palace is the large&s;t edifice, and &s;tands nearly in the center of the city. This build|ing is very exten&s;ive, and &s;urrounded by two &s;u|perb galleries &s;upported by marble pillars.</P>

<P>There are three great colleges or public &s;chools, and a great number of petty ones for children; four fundies or public inns, &s;uch as in Turkey; and above &s;ixty public bagnios or baths, at a very moderate rate. The women have baths of their own, where the men dare not come. But they have no caravan&s;eras; but only a few tippling huts, cook-&s;hops, &amp;c. kept by Chri&s;tian &s;laves, for the accommodation of Greeks, and the poorer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of travellers, where any thing may be had for money.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal tolerable edifices without the walls of the town, which add to the beauty of the environs. Among the&s;e are a great number of Turki&s;h &s;epulchres and monuments; as al&s;o cells or chapels, dedicated to marabouts, or reputed &s;aints, which the women go to vi&s;it every Friday. One of the&s;e monuments contains &s;ix magnificent tombs of a circular figure, which were erected to the memory of &s;ix deys, who were, in the cour&s;e of a few days, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively elected and murdered. With re&s;pect to the burial of their dead, the Mahometans di&s;cover a degree of delicacy, of which Chri&s;tians have no conception. Their graves are never bro|ken up a &s;econd time, and the profe&s;&s;ors of the Mahometan religion regard it as an act of the mo&s;t barbarous &s;acrilege to di&s;turb the remains of the dead, by opening their graves at any di&s;tance of

<HEAD>Bagnios.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are but two bagnios in the city, built of &s;tone, where the &s;laves are lodged, the one cal|led the Bagnio Baleck and the other the Bagnio Gallaro; the former of which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> much the large&s;t, and will contain three times as great a number as the latter. They &s;tand in the main &s;treet within about fifty yards of each other, between Bubazoon and the dey's palace. The lower apartments of the&s;e bagnios are occupied as taverns, which are kept by &s;laves, who pay the dey an annual tribute for the privilege, according to the quantity of li|quor they &s;ell. The tavern-keepers frequently manufacture their own wine in the&s;e bagnios, from g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">pes purcha&s;ed of the Moors. To the&s;e places the Turks re&s;ort while the &s;laves are at labour; but &s;oon as the &s;laves return the warden ba&s;haw com|pels them to retire: for they are not &s;uffered to be with the &s;laves. Each apartment is large enough to accommodate about a dozen &s;laves. The win|dows are formed of round cro&s;s bars of iron a|bout three or four inches apart, but without panes of gla&s;s. Down the &s;ides of the walls hang heavy chains of long links fixed to &s;taples, with rings to the ends, in which all di&s;orderly &s;laves are confined either by the leg or neck till morning, when they are puni&s;hed according to their crimes. The&s;e bagnios are under the guardian&s;hip of two corporals, who

<P>In the bagnio Gallaro five apartments are occu|pied by wild bea&s;ts, &s;uch as lions, tygers, leo|pards, &amp;c. intended as pre&s;ents to nations in alli|ance with the dey.

<P>The celebrated admiral Pinchinin was the own|er of a large bagnio about the year 1640, which is de&s;cribed as follows. This bagnio was occupied by all &s;uch &s;laves as were intended for his galleys. It was a &s;pacious building through which there was a narrow pa&s;&s;age or entry, which led into a large vault, that received only a &s;mall portion of light from a grate above; but &s;o in&s;ufficient that in &s;ome of the apartments it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep lamps burning the whole day. In the upper parts of the building there was a large &s;quare, contain|ing &s;everal galleries two &s;tories high, between which were &s;everal apartments, and a church for Chri&s;|tian &s;laves large enough to contain 300 per&s;ons. The roof was flat and terraced according to the Spani&s;h mode. This bagnio contained 550 &s;laves belonging to Pinchinin, whom he allowed three hours every day to provide for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, which they employed in &s;tealing and the practice of every &s;pecies of villany. The articles that had been &s;tolen the preceding day were &s;old every morning at public auction in the bagnio, and thus

<P>NONE of the &s;treets in Algiers have any names. They generally a&s;cend with the hill, and are &s;o ex|tremely narrow that two per&s;ons can &s;carcely walk a-brea&s;t. The middle part is lower than the &s;ides for the purpo&s;e of conveying off the water more conveniently. The principal &s;treet is 1200 paces in length; it runs north and &s;outh from the port of Bubazoon to Babloet, and is not above twelve feet wide.

<HEAD>Mole.</HEAD>
<P>THE harbour is the work of immen&s;e labour and difficulty. It is about fifteen feet deep, and ex|tremely dangerous for ve&s;&s;els. It is formed by a mole in the form of a &s;emicircle, about 500 paces in length, lying north-ea&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t from the town to a &s;mall i&s;land or rock called the Lantern; from which another mole of the &s;ame length is ex|tended north and &s;outh, for the purpo&s;e of forming a &s;helter. In the angle of the&s;e two moles &s;tands a &s;quare edifice, in the middle of which there is a court with rails, and four fountains u&s;ed for ablu|tions when the hour of prayer is proclaimed. Round the four &s;ides is a &s;eat covered with a mat, where the admiral and officers of the navy hold their daily meetings. The ca&s;tle called Sardinia, and the ca&s;tle of the Lantern &s;tand on the mole; the former of which is mounted with two, and the latter with three tire of guns. The lower tire are 32 pounders; but they are never prepared for de|fence upon &s;udden emergencies, for the lower apart|ments are &s;o filled with large quantities of lumber and naval &s;tores, that an enemy, &s;uddenly running into the harbour, might de&s;troy the city before they could bring their heavier pieces to play. Along the &s;ide of the mole there is a wharf for loading and un|loading &s;hips, and for mooring galleys and other ve&s;&s;els. Beneath the mole on one &s;ide is a &s;tone quay, and on the other &s;ide a &s;andy and rocky bank. All ve&s;&s;els lying along &s;ide the mole are moored about fifteen yards from the &s;hore, and &s;ecured by a
<PB N="202" REF="032877_0103_0FF5A9B5991ED8E0">
number of cables which extend in different direc|tions, and are la&s;hed fa&s;t to cannon planted in the mole. The mo&s;t boi&s;terous &s;ea is occa&s;ioned by a north-ea&s;t wind.

<P>The winter is the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ea&s;on for ve&s;|&s;els, and whenever a violent northern or north-ea&s;t wind blows, they are in danger either of being greatly damaged or driven on &s;hore.</P>

A little to the &s;outhward of this there is another which defends the entrance of the harbour, and is mounted with 80 pieces of cannon, 12, 18, and 36 pounders, point|ed from north to &s;outh; mo&s;t of which were taken taken from the Tuni&s;ians in 1617.

either through neglect or an apprehen&s;ion that it might prove de&s;tructive to the city in ca&s;e it &s;hould fall into the hands of an enemy; for it is &s;itu|ated on &s;o advantageous an eminence that from it the city might &s;oon be battered into ruins.</P>
<P>The new ca&s;tle, commonly called the <HI>Star,</HI> is built in a hepta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">onal form, and &s;ituated on an emi|nence to the &s;outh-we&s;t.

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e there are &s;everal along the &s;hore on the we&s;t &s;ide of the city. The battery of the mole gate &s;tands upon the ea&s;t angle of the city, and is mounted with &s;ix pieces of ordnance, one of which has &s;even cylinders, each of them three inches in diameter. About half a league to the we&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t of the harbour is the battery of the fi&s;her's gate, which is defended by a double tire of cannon, and commands the entrance of the port and the road be|fore it.</P>
<P>The &s;tronge&s;t fortifications are at the entrance of the harbour, the &s;ituation of which adds to its &s;ecu|rity; as the northern winds are generally violent, and occa&s;ion &s;uch a &s;ea, that &s;hips would be expo&s;ed to great danger, either in the road or along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Many former writers, either through ignorance, or a mi&s;grounded prejudice, have repre&s;ented all the&s;e fortification &s;o impregnable that they bid de|fiance to the confederated powers of the Chri&s;tians. But recent and more accurate ob&s;ervations have de|tected the fallacy of this account: and all per|&s;ons of ob&s;ervation who have lately re&s;ided there, unanimou&s;ly concur in the opinion, that three or at mo&s;t four Briti&s;h fifty-gun &s;hips, provided they
<PB N="204" REF="032877_0104_0FF5A9B723AB2E08">
met with no di&s;a&s;ter from the elements, would &s;oon batter it about the ears of the inhabitants from the harbour. A late writer ob&s;erves, that notwith&s;tanding their fortifications, the city is &s;o commanded by the adjacent kills on every &s;ide but that of the &s;ea, that from the&s;e eminencies, where it is mo&s;t vulnerable, a be&s;ieging army would &s;oon batter it into a heap of ruins.</P>
<P>It is not a little &s;ingular, however, that this city has, for &s;everal ages, braved &s;ome of the greate&s;t powers in Chri&s;tendom: but this mu&s;t be imputed to the very injudicious conduct of mo&s;t of the be|&s;iegers, or the violence of tempe&s;ts which have proved de&s;tructive to &s;o many ve&s;&s;els in their har|bour. The Spaniards in their attempts to reduce Algiers, have been the mo&s;t material &s;ufferers; but the pu&s;ilanimity of their forces has long been pro|verbial, and Spani&s;h di&s;comfiture is no kind of crite|rion to judge of the defen&s;ive powers of the Alge|rines.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE pre&s;ent dey of Algiers was originally a Turki&s;h &s;oldier, and was imported into Al|giers from a place near Smyrna about the year 1786. He was at fir&s;t employed about the old dey's palace, and by his artifice he &s;oon after became &s;o great a court favorite, that he obtained the office of vichelhadge of the marine. Shortly after this event the ca&s;&s;an-aga, or prime mini&s;ter, through the intrigues of the ba&s;haw of Con&s;tantina with the old dey, fell a victim to the bow-&s;tring, and Ha&s;&s;an Ba&s;haw, the pre&s;ent dey, was promo|ted to the vacant office of ca&s;&s;an-aga, Cedelli, who was a Grecian of an enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, &s;uc|ceeded him in the office of vichelhadge, and the old dey &s;hortly after dying a natural death, Ce|delli, who was Ha&s;&s;an's friend, in&s;i&s;ted upon his a&s;&s;uming the imperial chair. Ha&s;&s;an di&s;covered great reluctance; but Cedelli, who came armed with a party for the purpo&s;e, forced him into the chair and &s;upported him there. The aga &s;hortly after made his appearance, intending to conte&s;t the right of &s;overeignty with him, and attempted to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him him in his &s;eat; but he was &s;eized by the chiahs, who dragged him to the Logger Ba&s;tion, where he received the bow-&s;tring, and one of Ha&s;&s;an's friends was appointed aga in his &s;tead.

<P>Cedelli &s;oon after greatly incurred the di&s;plea|&s;ure of Ha&s;&s;an. The dey had i&s;&s;ued orders that no Dutch ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be captured within forty days; but Cedelli, either through de&s;ign or inad|vertence, gave in&s;tructions to the cor&s;airs to make immediate captures, and &s;everal Dutch ve&s;&s;els were brought into Algiers; which &s;o violently exa&s;perated Ha&s;&s;an, that he demanded in a vengeful and &s;arca&s;tic tone, whether he or Cedelli was dey of Algiers? Cedelli fortunately e&s;caped the bow|&s;tring, but was immediately bani&s;hed from Al|giers.</P>
<P>When con&s;uls, foreign agents, and other official characters enter the dey's palace, they are reque&s;ted to pull off their &s;hoes, and this ceremony is al|ways expected. His vi&s;itors then approach him with great reverence and ki&s;s his hand. The dey and his vi&s;itors are &s;eated on &s;labs of marble or &s;late projecting from the wall, about three feet high, up|on which are placed cu&s;hions elegantly embroidered and fringed with gold, where his vi&s;itors &s;it cro&s;s legged. The dey &s;its with a large fan of o&s;triches' feathers in his hand. All other Turks of di&s;tinc|tion receive their vi&s;itors in the &s;ame manner. While they are thus &s;eated they are &s;erved by &s;laves with coffee, which is con&s;idered the greate&s;t treat that can be given, and as a particular mark of di&s;|tinction conferred upon his vi&s;itors.</P>

No per&s;on is &s;uffered to enter his palace with d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g|gers or any kind of arms; and when &s;uch attempts are made, the dey, through apprehen&s;ion of a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;i|nation, makes the mo&s;t hideous outcries; the delin|quent is &s;eized, and &s;everal hundred &s;trokes of the ba&s;tinado are inflicted upon him for the offence.</P>
<P>When the Grand Signior approves of the dey's conduct he &s;ends him an elegant robe called a <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|tan</HI> to &s;ignify his approbation of his conduct in ad|mini&s;tration. A pre&s;ent of this nature is highly ac|ceptable, becau&s;e it is a great protection to his per|&s;on, and conciliates the minds of the people in his favour.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent dey is about 50 years old. His face is decorated with a long black beard. He is a man of a venerable a&s;pect and of a meje&s;tic per&s;on, be|ing about &s;ix feet high, but rather inclining to lean|ne&s;s. He &s;peaks in a very imperious and authori|tative tone, as is the ca&s;e with all the Turks. He goes bare legged, but with &s;lippers on his feet, and cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed by his dre&s;s from the re&s;t of the Turks; but only by the greater veneration that is paid him.</P>
<P>When he walks the &s;treets of Algiers his <HI>li&s;beros</HI> go before him with clubs in their hands to clear the way, and as he approaches every per&s;on flies with precipitation into bye-ways; for if any one comes within the reach of their clubs he is &s;ure to be knock|ed down and trampled under foot. When he rides out, even upon a full gallop, the&s;e li&s;beros run before him, and every ob&s;tacle mu&s;t give way at his approach.</P>
<P>While the American pri&s;oners were in Algiers the dey once conde&s;cended to vi&s;it the marine, which was looked upon as the mo&s;t &s;ingular event that ever occurred; for neither the dey, the ca&s;&s;an-aga,
<PB N="208" REF="032877_0106_0FF5A9C597B61568">
nor aga, are ever known to pay &s;uch vi&s;its. As he approached the &s;hore the cannon of the ca&s;tles, and on the walls of the city were fired, trumpets &s;ounded, and French horns played from the marine. He was attended by all the rais or commanders of ve&s;&s;els, who regarded this vi&s;it as the very highe&s;t compliment. He gave the warden ba&s;haw a con|&s;iderable &s;um of money to be di&s;tributed among the &s;laves. After examining the marine he was invited into the &s;kiff of the vichelhadge, where he &s;at down with his attendants and after drinking a di&s;h of coffee retired to his palace.</P>
<P>The dey keeps about 30 concubines in his &s;erag|lio, who are attended by black enuchs, but the wo|men are never &s;een by the &s;laves. He has but one child, a daughter about &s;even years old, who is the greate&s;t favorite imaginable with the dey. She was engaged to be married to the late vichelhadge of the marine, who was the dey's relation. But he was either killed or drowned in his voyage to the Levant, where the dey &s;ent him with a large &s;um of money, for the purpo&s;e of building a &s;uperb mo&s;que at the place of his birth.</P>
<P>From the mo&s;t authentic accounts it appears that many of the people of Algiers, and the kingdom in general, are ho&s;pitable, humane, and of &s;trict in|tegrity. A Moor when he finds any articles that have been lo&s;t, never clande&s;tinely appropriates them to his own u&s;e, but has them always cried through the &s;treets that the owner may po&s;&s;e&s;s his property again. But in con&s;equence of the vio|lence that is exerci&s;ed over them, and their total &s;ub&s;erviency to the rapacious views of their Tur|ki&s;h oppre&s;&s;ors, they &s;upport perhaps the mo&s;t in|famous character of any nation in the world. Eve|ry &s;park of political liberty is totally extingui&s;hed,
<PB N="209" REF="032877_0106_0FF5A9C597B61568">
and the government has now attained to the very acme of the mo&s;t horrible de&s;poti&s;m. As the Turks maintain their a&s;cendency by the mo&s;t ri|gorous mea&s;ures, their government exhibits a per|petual &s;cene of jealou&s;y, apprehen&s;ion and op|pre&s;&s;ion; no man can promi&s;e him&s;elf a moment's &s;ecurity either in his per&s;on or property; for the power of life and death is ve&s;ted in the hands of the dey, which he exerci&s;es with impunity; and whenever he covets the riches of any of his opu|lent &s;ubjects, he orders them to be di&s;patched with a bow-&s;tring, and falls heir to what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. When the order of execution is an|nounced to any one, he &s;ubmits patiently to his fate, which he has perhaps long anticipated, and as &s;oon as the order is executed there is an immediate &s;cramble among the &s;ervants for the money, jew|els, and other valuable articles which belonged to their ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>According to the common computation, the num|ber of inhabitants in this city is 100,000 Mahome|tans, 1500 Jews, and 2000 Chri&s;tian &s;laves; but no cen&s;us can be accurate for any length of time, as thou&s;ands are carried off by the plague; and the number of &s;laves is &s;till more fluctuating, as they are &s;ubject to an uncertain increa&s;e by cap|ture, and a diminution by ran&s;om, or death by the &s;everity of their toils.</P>
<P>The city of Algiers is vi&s;ited almo&s;t every year by the plague, which generally begins in May, and continues for the &s;pace of three months. When it commences its vi&s;itation no per&s;on is at liberty to circulate any report of its exi&s;tence, or his life would be in danger; but when the contagion becomes more prevalent one of the marabouts vi&s;its the dey

and informs him of its exi&s;tence; after which the citizens are at liberty to take every precaution for their pre&s;ervation; &s;ome retire into the country, but the dey and mo&s;t of the people always remain in the city. The fir&s;t &s;tage of this di&s;order is a violent fever which brings on a delirium, but if the patient can &s;urvive this fever he has every a&s;|&s;urance of his recovery. The di&s;ea&s;e, however, operates differently upon different con&s;titutions; &s;ome blead at the mouth, no&s;e, and ears; &s;ome break out in lived &s;pots all over their bodies, and many continue in a &s;tate of coma, or lethar|gy, till they expire, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> generally at the end of the third day after the di&s;order &s;eizes them. About one half of tho&s;e who are attacked by this di&s;order recover, but they are notwith&s;tanding always liable to, though not &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of the in|fection after they have once been &s;eized with it.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t malignant plague raged in Algiers about the year 1787, which carried off immen&s;e num|bers of the inhabitants; the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o viru|lent that the &s;treets were filled with dead bodies, and the mortality &s;o great that a &s;ufficient number of per&s;ons could &s;carcely be procured to bury them. Slaves are very frequently &s;eized with this di&s;or|der at their labour, and they are &s;uffered to die upon the ground without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and with as much unconcern as if they were bea&s;ts&punc; As they have neither medical books, nor men of learning, it mu&s;t naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed they have no phy&s;i|cians. When a per&s;on is &s;eized with any di&s;order the only mode of cure is to rub the patient, and at the &s;ame time to place his body in a variety of at|titudes, and if this whim&s;ical treatment does not &s;ucceed, nothing farther is attempted.</P>

They dine at eleven, and drink coffee again at four in the afternoon. In eating they are &s;eated cro&s;s-legged on mats round tables about &s;ix inches high, and they u&s;e neither knives nor forks. Their common food is mutton, beef or poultry, boiled to rags, which they eat with cuzcuz. An Algerine never &s;uffers his wives to eat with him, but obliges them to &s;erve him till he has fini&s;hed his meal, at which time they are permitted to &s;it down to the table. The Turks in particular are very tenacious of this precedence, becau&s;e they regard women as an inferior order in creation, and con&s;equently not entitled to &s;imilar di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of particular meats is &s;trictly forbidden, and in conformity to the cu&s;tom of the ea&s;tern na|tions the Alcoran prohibits the u&s;e of &s;wine's fle&s;h, the eating of blood, and whatever dies of it&s;elf, or is &s;trangled, or killed by a blow, or fall, or by any other bea&s;t. In which particulars Mahomet &s;eems to have adopted the laws of the Jews, by which all the&s;e things are forbidden.

to hogs that they will fly at the &s;ight of one as quick|ly as from the mo&s;t ferocious wild bea&s;t; for they deem it a great contamination even to be touched by a &s;wine, and a hundred well di&s;ciplined hogs would take Algiers much &s;ooner than an army of the very brave&s;t Spaniards. Many, however, among the le&s;s con&s;cientious Moors, who are not &s;o apprehen|&s;ive of pollution, bring con&s;iderable quantities of pork to market, which they &s;ell at a very moderate price to the Chri&s;tian &s;laves, who derive a great be|nefit from this cu&s;tom; for a full grown hog is fre|quently &s;old for le&s;s than a &s;equin.</P>
<P>The people have &s;o &s;ingular an attachment to coffee, or the u&s;e of it is &s;o extremely fa&s;hionable, that trade&s;men and mechanics while they fit engaged at their bu&s;ine&s;s along the platforms in front of their hou&s;es, have their di&s;hes of coffee before them. The Turks, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are too con&s;cien|tious to make u&s;e of &s;piritous liquors, &s;pend whole days at the coffee hou&s;es in &s;moking and &s;ipping coffee: and as they devote no part of their time to reading or the improvment of the mind, they ap|pear entirely dive&s;ted of all reflection, and become the mere &s;laves of their &s;en&s;ual appetites.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of coffee fir&s;t took its origin at <HI>Aden</HI> in Arabia Felix about the year 1436; from whence it was gradually introduced into Mecca, Medina, Syria, Europe and other parts of the world. It has been the &s;ubject of great contention and di&s;orders; the u&s;e of it has been often pro&s;cribed, and as often de|clared lawful and allowed: but at pre&s;ent it is uni|ver&s;ally tolerated.</P>
<P>The drinking of wine, under which name is com|prehended all kinds of &s;trong liquors, is forbidden in the Alcoran in more places than one. Some have imagined that exce&s;s only is therein forbidden, and
<PB N="213" REF="032877_0108_0FF5A9C8A5014058">
they allege that the moderate u&s;e of wine is allowed in two pa&s;&s;ages of the Alcoran; but the more re|ceived opinion is, that the u&s;e of &s;trong liqours either in a greater or le&s;s quantity is ab&s;olutely unlawful; and though libertines indulge them&s;elves in a con|trary practice, yet the more con&s;cientious, and espe|cially tho&s;e who have performed a pilgrimage to Mecca, are &s;o rigid that they deem it unlawful not only to ta&s;te wine, but to make it, or to maintain them&s;elves by the purcha&s;e and &s;ale of that liquor.</P>
<P>They are, however, extravagantly fond of wine, and if one a&s;ks them how it happens that they ven|ture to drink it when it is &s;o &s;trictly forbidden, they an&s;wer that it is with them as with the Chri&s;tians, who&s;e religion prohibits drunkenne&s;s, and who de|light notwith&s;tanding in drinking to exce&s;s. The dey was formerly much addicted to this practice, but &s;ince he has been in admini&s;tration, he has be|come very exemplary in this re&s;pect, and it is dan|gerous for any of his vi&s;itors to breath the fumes of wine in his prefence.</P>
<P>It has been a que&s;tion whether coffee is not impli|edly prohibited by the Alcoran, becau&s;e it has an intoxicating property; and it is probable that the former prohibition of it originated from this circum|&s;tance alone.</P>
<P>The more con&s;cientious reject the u&s;e of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> not only becau&s;e it intoxicates, but in con&s;equence of a traditional &s;aying of their prophet, which, if it were really his, would prove him a prophet in|deed, <Q>That in the latter days there &s;hould be men who &s;hould bear the name of Mu&s;&s;ulmen, but &s;hould not be really &s;uch, and that they &s;hould &s;moke a certain weed which &s;hould be cal|led <HI>Tobacco.</HI></Q></P>
<PB N="214" REF="032877_0109_0FF5A9D7DF4EC540">
<P>Opium, though not mentioned in the Alcoran, is e&s;teemed unlawful by the more rigid Mahometans, becau&s;e it intoxicates in a more extraordinary man|ner.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the Turks, however, di&s;re|gard all this ab&s;tinence, and as the&s;e lords of the Algerines are &s;upported at the public expence, their whole life, is an uninterrupted &s;eries of in|trigue, debauchery and intoxication: foibles na|tural to all tho&s;e who have no other pur&s;uit in life to engage their attention. The greate&s;t tyrants in nature are drunken Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, who &s;eem to be under no re&s;traint either of law or con&s;cience. Great numbers of the&s;e brutes, after having in|toxicated them&s;elves, i&s;&s;ue forth into the &s;treets with their <HI>tahans,</HI> or &s;words drawn, and every per|&s;on mu&s;t fly at their approach, or they would be in danger of their lives. The Jews in particular are ever the objects of their indignation, and whenever they di&s;cover a Jew they immediately pur&s;ue him, while the poor de&s;pi&s;ed wretch flies with the most hideous outcries to avoid the outrage of the&s;e banditti, who are at liberty to commit any act of violence upon him, with impunity; for &s;hould a Jew make application for redre&s;s of griev|ances, he would in all probability be ba&s;tinaded for his pre&s;umption. So cordially is this race of people de&s;pi&s;ed, that when one wi&s;hes to ca&s;t any obloquy, or a&s;per&s;ion of ignominy upon another, he calls him <HI>Judeo</HI> or Jew; and even herd&s;men in driving their cattle will call them <HI>Judeo,</HI> which is the mo&s;t ignominious term of reproach that can be given.</P>
<P>The Turks are &s;o proud that, like the American Indians, they deem them&s;elves &s;uperior to all other

nations in the world, and the mo&s;t valiant among the race of men. They imagine that the world was made for them alone; and con&s;equently they entertain a perfect contempt for all other nations in general, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are of a different re|ligion, and they commonly call Chri&s;tians, <HI>dogs.</HI> Some carry this &s;uper&s;titious aver&s;ion to &s;o great an exce&s;s, that if the fir&s;t per&s;on they meet in the morn|ing, when they come out of their hou&s;es, be a Chri&s;tian or Jew, they return home immediately, &s;aying, <HI>God pre&s;erve us from the devil.</HI></P>
<P>The Turks are, as is the ca&s;e with many other people, mo&s;t extravagantly fond of money, and they have long been proverbial for their mercenary di&s;po&s;itions. The con&s;uls of foreign nations find that the Algerines are not to be wrought upon by remon&s;trance; they expect &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tan|tial, and more is to be gained by flattery, and an artful addre&s;s, than by the mo&s;t powerful arguments: for according to the old adage, <Q>Give a Turk mo|ney with one hand, and he will let you pluck his eyes out with the other.</Q> This was remark|ably verified in the ca&s;e of a Briti&s;h con&s;ul, who once made application to Ali Ba&s;haw, a late dey, and urged a complaint again&s;t the depredations of the Algerine cor&s;airs, without the grand preliminary, <HI>money.</HI> The dey appeared &s;omewhat re&s;tle&s;s, and pe|tulantly an&s;wered, <HI>The Algerines are a &s;et of rogues and I'm their captain:</HI> &s;o that national ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty are great rarities here.</P>
<P>To complete the picture of human depravity, the Turks are guilty of the mo&s;t unnatural crimes, which are here regarded with &s;uch perfect indif|ference, that the poorer &s;ort of people &s;end their children into the &s;treets to &s;eek a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by

the mo&s;t nefarious pro&s;titution, and neither pu|ni&s;hment nor the lea&s;t &s;hade of ignominy is the con&s;equence of detection. A Turk will &s;igh with as much ardency for a hand&s;ome boy, as old Vir|gil, who appears to have been a lover of this de|&s;cription, lamented the lo&s;s of the beautiful Alexis. Sodomy is &s;o extremely fa&s;hionable among them, and &s;o little are they di&s;po&s;ed to keep this foible a &s;ecret, that it is the &s;ubject of their mo&s;t plain|tive &s;ongs, and they will &s;pare no pains in pro|curing the gratification of their infamous love. We are told of a Turk who being di&s;appointed in one of his ignominious amours, and being actuated by the mo&s;t &s;ingular impul&s;e, commanded his &s;lave to place a red hot brand of fire upon his naked arm, which he &s;uffered to be burnt almo&s;t to the bone.</P>
<P>It was cu&s;tomary with former deys to &s;end an annual tribute of a number of beautiful boys to the Grand Signiors, who are a little tinctured with this vice; but at pre&s;ent this tribute con&s;i&s;ts of a num|ber of Arabian hor&s;es. We are credibly informed, that the famous admiral Pinchinin, kept in his hou&s;e forty young boys between nine and fifteen years of age, who were never &s;uffered to go into the &s;treets, le&s;t they might be &s;educed by the Turks. Pinchinin was not, however, addicted to this vice; but what di&s;covered the mo&s;t &s;ingular pride in hu|man nature, was that he kept the&s;e boys merely through a principle of vanity and o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>One virtuous trait in a Turk's character is that he ab&s;tains from all profane &s;wearing, and is never guil|ty of &s;uch bla&s;phemous imprecations as a Chri&s;tian. The American &s;laves were much addicted to this vice, and did not he&s;itate to reproach their Turki&s;h over|&s;eers with the mo&s;t opprobrious language; &s;o tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>The Algerines never &s;hake hands when they meet, but the u&s;ual mode of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alutation, is a &s;light in|inclination of the head, and placing both hands upon their brea&s;ts, imploring a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings, and calling tho&s;e whom they &s;alute brethren.

They receive the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of ammunition generally once a month, and the dey u&s;es great caution in the di&s;tribution of this article. His own palace is converted into a magazine, where all the lead in the city is depo&s;ited under his own immediate direction, and &s;erved out in &s;uch portions as nece&s;&s;ity requires. His maga|zines of powder are well &s;ecured upon the mole, and all this precaution he u&s;es to prevent any ef|fectual oppo&s;ition in ca&s;e of an in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>The Algerines read no other books but the Al|coran, and the comments of authors who have writ|ten thereon: of cour&s;e the &s;phere of their know|ledge cannot be expected to be very exten&s;ive. They under&s;tand a few of the fir&s;t principles of arithmetic, but of geometry, poetry, painting, and the &s;ublimer &s;trains of mu&s;ic, they have &s;carcely any conception. All their books are manu&s;cripts, and there is not a pre&s;s in all the city. To them the art of printing appears perfectly contemptible: they repo&s;e no kind of confidence in it, and it is regarded as an impo&s;ition rather than a benefit.</P>
<P>Painting is &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, that many figures, &s;uch as men, women, bea&s;ts, &amp;c. are prohibited, and the &s;ight of them is regarded as a great &s;in. They are, however, great admirers of watches and clocks; but if they &s;ee them embelli&s;hed with any of the&s;e figures they cannot refrain from expre&s;&s;|ing their anger. They have a &s;imilar aver&s;ion to bells, and they are &s;o exa&s;perated at the &s;ound,
<PB N="219" REF="032877_0111_0FF5A9DB0880AE78">
that the crews of many foreign nations lying in their harbour have often been beaten for ringing their bells.</P>
<P>Gaming is prohibited in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages of the Alcoran which prohibit the u&s;e of wine. The word, as it is there u&s;ed, &s;ignifies a particular mode of ca&s;ting lots by arrows according to the practice of the pagan Arabs. But the commentators agree, that under the name of <HI>lots</HI> are comprehended all games what&s;oever which are &s;ubject to chance or ha|zard, &s;uch as cards, dice, tables, &amp;c. which are forbidden. All the&s;e games are deemed &s;o highly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">agitious by the more rigid Mohometans, that they judge the evidence of him who plays at them of no validity in a court of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The only game that is played in Algiers is che&s;s, and this the Mahometan doctors allow, (though o|thers have doubted its legality) becau&s;e it de|pends &s;olely upon art and the &s;kilful manage|ment of the pieces u&s;ed in playing. But it is never &s;uffered to prevent the regular performance of their devotions, and per&s;ons are never permitted to play for money, or things of the mo&s;t trifling va|lue.</P>
<P>In Algiers the men have no intercour&s;e with the women before marriage, and marriage contracts are entirely negociated by female confidants employed by the men, who tender the parents a certain &s;um of money according to their demand, and the lady is thus purcha&s;ed as though &s;he were an article of mer|chandize. Hence it &s;eldom happens that marriages thus contracted are cemented with love, and by thus violating the law of nature, they lay a &s;ure foun|dation for intrigue, jealou&s;y, and the mo&s;t boi&s;terous pa&s;&s;ions. When the marriage contract is conclud|ed,
<PB N="220" REF="032877_0112_0FF5A9DC8E98D8D0">
the principal nuptial ceremony con&s;i&s;t in e&s;cort|ing the lady to her hu&s;band. A proce&s;&s;ion of her female friends and relations is formed about ten o'clock at night, attended by a number of black fe|male flaves with burning torches in their hands, and as this proce&s;&s;ion moves along they make a &s;trange kind of noi&s;e at intervals till they enter the hou&s;e of the hu&s;band, who for the fir&s;t time beholds his fair bride, whom his imagination had long perhaps portrayed as the paragon of all excellence. The company then retires, and the next day the marks of virginity are triumphantly di&s;played upon the tops of their hou&s;es, in the pre&s;ence of the bride's friends and relations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if this evidence of virtue can|not be produced, the hu&s;band returns his wife to her parents, and the marriage is di&s;&s;olved without fur|ther ceremony.</P>
<P>The Algerine women are remarkably amorous, and though all intercour&s;e between them and the Chri&s;tians is prohibited under penalty of death, yet it does not deter them from their at|tempts to circumvent every Chri&s;tian &s;lave who comes in their way, for whom they have a remark|able attachment. Numbers of the&s;e frail fair ones rove the &s;treets every night for the purpo&s;e of in|trigue, and they make the fir&s;t advances with great effrontery and adroitne&s;s; but &s;uch is the vigi|lance of the li&s;beros, who are highly rewarded for every Chri&s;tian that is detected, that tho&s;e who are venture&s;ome enough to undertake an amorous corre&s;pondence, are every moment in imminent danger of falling a &s;acrifice to their gallantry.</P>
<P>Some of the former deys had it in contemplation to incorporate the &s;laves with the citizens, and to permit their intermarriages, but the marabouts, who were apprehen&s;ive that &s;uch a law would contami|nate
<PB N="221" REF="032877_0112_0FF5A9DC8E98D8D0">
the purity of Mahometan blood, remon&s;trated &s;o &s;trongly again&s;t it, that all intercour&s;e between Chri&s;tian &s;laves and Moori&s;h women was made a ca|pital crime.</P>
<P>The women lead a mo&s;t indolent life; they com|monly amu&s;e them&s;elves with needle work or em|broidery; but are never &s;ubjected to dome&s;tic drudgery, which is done by &s;laves, and whatever their condition may be, they are never engaged in any employment out of their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>In their dre&s;s they di&s;play neither ta&s;te nor judg|ment, and to an American or European they appear extremely uncouth. When they vi&s;it or appear abroad the beauty of their per&s;ons is entirely con|cealed. They wear a clum&s;y kind of panta|loons, and according to the phrase of the Ameri|can captives, they resemble a bundle of rags in mo|tion, rather than women. Like the French ladies they are very fond of <HI>rouge;</HI> but in&s;tead of their cheeks they have a &s;ingular fancy in painting their foreheads with a &s;tripe of red, which extends above their eye brows.</P>
<P>Their di&s;habille, or rather the manner in which they dre&s;s in their hou&s;es, is very la&s;civious. They wear a cap formed of threads of gold interwoven like net work, round which is tied a fine &s;ilk hand|kerchief, and their hair hangs confined in a &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ilken pouch. Their brea&s;ts, arms, and legs are naked, but the re&s;t of their body is covered with a large &s;ilk mantle, which only reaches down to the knees, and is tied about their middle with a kind of &s;a&s;h. Their &s;lippers are elegantly wrought with gold; and round their wri&s;ts and ancles they wear bracelets &s;et with jewels. They ride concealed in a large &s;quare box covered with a kind of red baize,
<PB N="222" REF="032877_0113_0FF5A9ED5AB0BF98">
placed upon a&s;&s;es or mules, and when they walk the &s;treets they are always veiled. They are extremely cautious of di&s;covering their faces to &s;trangers,&punc;par|ticularly to Chri&s;tian &s;laves, which they deem &s;o &s;a|cred that they would &s;ooner di&s;clo&s;e any other part of their body. An American &s;lave was ordered one day by a Turk, to carry &s;ome bottles of wine from one of the bagnios to his hou&s;e, and in pa&s;|&s;ing through one of the apartments he &s;urprized the Turk's lady, who&s;e face was perfectly unveiled. The di&s;concerted fair one, overcome with a&s;toni&s;h|ment at the &s;udden and unexpected appearance of a &s;lave, immediately covered her face with her petty|coats, and in &s;o doing di&s;clo&s;ed tho&s;e parts which were much more the object of the American's ri&s;ibility.</P>
<P>There is not much difference, as we have before ob&s;erved, between the dre&s;s of the men and women. The men wear a kind of clum&s;y trow&s;ers which reach down to the knees, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the Roman habit. Their legs and arms are bear; but in cold or wet weather they wear <HI>capoots;</HI> a kind of great coats which nearly cover the whole body.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the marabouts is a kind of green coat, or gown which reaches down to the knees. The hats of &s;ome of them, or rather the covering of their heads, re&s;embles a large di&s;h formed of linen drawn over a piece of circular pa&s;teboard: others wear a high cap &s;omewhat in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf with a &s;mall part of the top cut off. Some of the marabouts are &s;o highly venerated by the Moors, that they run and ki&s;s their hands as they p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s along the &s;treets. The dey is con&s;idered as the grand or &s;upreme marabout of his kingdom.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Jews does not differ much from that of the Turks, and the manner in which they
<PB N="223" REF="032877_0113_0FF5A9ED5AB0BF98">
are principally di&s;tingui&s;hed, con&s;i&s;ts in the differ|ence of colour, which is black, a di&s;tinction they are obliged to ob&s;erve. There is al&s;o a difference in the form of their turbans, and their &s;lippers which have &s;uch a &s;mall portion of upper leather, that they can &s;carcely keep them on their feet; for they are not &s;uffered to wear &s;hoes without paying an exorbitant duty to the dey for the privilege.</P>
<P>They have few funeral ceremonies, and they ne|ver change their dre&s;s when any of their relations die. They wa&s;h the dead with great care, and burn incen&s;e about them to drive away evil &s;pirits. They have no coffins, but bury them in a clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> open at top and bottom. Before the interment they expo&s;e their dead in the hou&s;e, upon a bier, under a pall of different colours fringed with gold according to the quality of the per&s;on. The place of interment is without the walls of the town, and the corps is at|tended thither by four, or &s;ometimes eight carriers. No women ever attend their funerals, but a few days after, the female relations vi&s;it the grave, over which they weep and &s;trew wreaths of flowers.</P>
<P>The Algerines believe that when the decea&s;ed is laid in the ground, two angels come, and make him get upon his knees to render an account of his actions. If he has lived a virtuous life, two an|gels as white as &s;now, &s;ucceed tho&s;e who came to examine him, and entertain him with a full account of the plea&s;ures he is to enjoy in the next world. But if he has lived a vicious life, two angels as black as jet are commi&s;&s;ioned to inflict the mo&s;t cru|el tortures upon him. One, they &s;ay, &s;trikes him into the earth with a club, and the other pulls him up again with an iron hook; and thus they employ
<PB N="224" REF="032877_0114_0FF5A9EEE2F45958">
them&s;elves in the infliction of this cruel puni&s;hment&punc; without the lea&s;t re&s;pite till the day of judgment.</P>
<P>In religion it &s;eems that rigorous re&s;trictions are no criterion to judge of the political integrity of a nation; for though the Algerines are as punctilious in their religious &s;ervices as any people whatever, yet they &s;upport the mo&s;t infamous national charac|ter upon earth. They wor&s;hip no le&s;s than five times in the twenty-four hours; once ju&s;t before day-break, again at one o'clock, and at the time of lazar in the afternoon, and about one o'clock at night. Ju&s;t be|fore their wor&s;hip commences in the day, a &s;mall white flag is rai&s;ed on all the mo&s;ques, as a &s;ignal for preparation; the marabouts &s;oon after a&s;cend the cupola of the mo&s;ques, and turning their face to the ea&s;t and rai&s;ing their hands to their heads, cry out with a loud voice; upon which the male inhabi|tants wa&s;h their hands, face, and feet, and repair to the mo&s;ques, where they arrange them&s;elves in files, with their face turned towards the ea&s;t. None of their mo&s;ques have pews, but they are paved with marble. Before each per&s;on is placed a &s;traw mat, upon which he kneels. After a &s;hort pau&s;e of &s;ilence, during which their lips are in continual mo|tion, they all rai&s;e their hands to their heads, then place them on their knees, kneel down on their mats, and all pro&s;trate their heads upon the floor at the &s;ame in&s;tant, from which they immediately ri&s;e again into an erect po&s;ture. By continual practice they perform the&s;e evolutions with the greate&s;t pre|ci&s;ion imaginable, and all their motions corre&s;pond more perfectly in point of time than the exerci&s;e of the be&s;t di&s;ciplined troops. This ceremony conti|nues about fifteen minutes, after which the wor&s;hip|pers retire to their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="032877_0114_0FF5A9EEE2F45958">
A fimilar ceremony is ob&s;erved every day in the marine. The marabout who officiates there cries out from the top of one of the ca&s;tles on the mole, which is the &s;ignal for <HI>diving,</HI> as the Americans facetiou&s;ly termed it. The marabouts have nothing to do in this part of religious duty; but they deliver a di&s;|cour&s;e every Friday in the mo&s;ques, from a kind of ro&s;trum or pulpit. This di&s;cour&s;e, and their other religious ceremonies, continue on that day from eleven till one o'clock, during which time the gates of the city and the doors of the bagnios are &s;hut. The people do not attend public wor&s;hip at night, but as soon as they hear the voice of the marabout, they ri&s;e up and perform their exerci&s;e of devotion in their own apartments. All the Mahometans who re&s;ide near the city, immediately pro&s;trate them|&s;elves as &s;oon as they &s;ee the flags rai&s;ed on the mo&s;ques; and be&s;ides all this religious &s;ervitude the&s;e <HI>very righteous people</HI> daily employ them&s;elves, like the illiterate among the Roman Catholics, in count|ing over their &s;trings of beads.</P>
<P>The dey only attends public wor&s;hip on Fridays, at a mo&s;que nearly oppo&s;ite to his palace, where the principal Turks a&s;&s;emble, and he pa&s;&s;es between two files of his Turki&s;h guards, who are &s;tationed between the door of his palace and that of the mo&s;que.</P>
<P>After performing the exerci&s;e of humility, and hearing a di&s;cour&s;e from the marabout, he retires to his palace where, as he enters, he is &s;prinkled with holy water of a fragrant &s;mell.</P>
<P>Every Friday is devoted to public wor&s;hip, and corre&s;ponds to the Jewi&s;h Saturday, or Chri&s;tian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">unday. Many rea&s;ons are given why this day was appointed for this purpo&s;e. Some are of opi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">on that it was the day on which God fini&s;hed
<PB N="226" REF="032877_0115_0FF5A9F071EA9850">
the works of creation; but Mr. Sale remarks, that Mahomet &s;eems to have preferred that day princi|pally becau&s;e it was the day on which the people were accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;emble long before his time: though &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies were perhaps intended for civil rather than religious purpo&s;es. Though the Mahometans in general do not conceive them|&s;elves obligated to keep that day &s;o holy as the Jews and Chri&s;tians are bound to keep their Sabbath, (there being permi&s;&s;ion in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> as is gene|rally &s;uppo&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 62.</NOTE>, that that they may return to their employments or diver&s;ions after divine &s;er|vice is ended,) yet the more devout di&s;approve of the practice of applying any part of that day to worldly concerns, and require it to be wholly dedicated to the purpo&s;es of religion. The &s;laves are neither exempted from labour upon this, nor any other day of the week; but they are generally al|lowed one Friday in every month for the purpo&s;e of re&s;t or recreation.</P>
<P>All the&s;e religious re&s;trictions are, however, in|&s;ufficient, and once every year they are &s;ubjected to a rigorous ab&s;tinence called <HI>Ramadan,</HI> or <HI>Ra|mazan,</HI> which generally begins in May, and conti|nues from the time the new moon fir&s;t appears till the appearance of the next new moon, during which time they refrain from women, and neither eat, drink, &s;nuff, nor &s;moke tobacco, from day-break, till &s;un-&s;et. The punctilious ob&s;ervance of this duty is enjoined under penalty of death, and tho&s;e who are detected in indulging their appetites, &s;ome &s;ay, are compelled to drink melted lead as a pu|ni&s;hment for their crime. About &s;un-&s;et the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="227" REF="032877_0115_0FF5A9F071EA9850">
of the marabout ri&s;es, as a &s;ignal for eating, which is looked for with great anxiety; after which they are at liberty to gratify their appetites as they plea&s;e. During the time of Ramadan an univer&s;al moro&s;ene&s;s prevails among the people, and the dey, who finds it nece&s;&s;ary to conform to this cu&s;tom, is &s;o much out of humour, that no bu&s;ine&s;s can be tran&s;acted with him during the continuance of this fa&s;t. The Turks experience the greate&s;t mortifi|cation, becau&s;e they are abridged of all the plea|&s;ures their &s;en&s;ual natures are capable of enjoying; they are neither permitted to frequent the bagnios, taverns, nor coffee-hou&s;es, and they wait for the termination of this fa&s;t with the greate&s;t impatience. Towards the expiration of the month the Turks a&s;cend their cazarees every evening, and look with longing eyes towards the we&s;t for the di&s;covery of the new moon, which is called the moon of <HI>Che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|val;</HI> for at the moment of its appearance the fa&s;t is at an end: the Turks then indulge the mo&s;t ex|travagant mirth; they fire a <HI>feu de joye</HI> to congra|tulate its appearance, and to proclaim the end of the fa&s;t.</P>
<P>This fa&s;t, which is the third point of religious practice, is a duty of &s;o much importance, that Ma|homet u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>It was the gate of religion,</HI> and that <HI>the odour of the mouth of him who fa&s;teth is more grateful to God than that of mu&s;k.</HI></P>
<P>According to the Mahometan divines there are three degrees of fa&s;ting; 1&s;t. The re&s;training the belly and other parts of the body from &s;atisfying their lu&s;t. 2d. The re&s;training the ears, eyes, tongue, hands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eet, and others members from &s;in. 3d. The fa&s;t|ing of the heart from all worldly cares, and re|fraining the thoughts from every thing be&s;ides God. The Mahometans are obliged, by expre&s;s

command of the Alcoran, to fa&s;t the whole month of Ramadan, and in con&s;equence of this ab&s;temious &s;everity, which is a real &s;in again&s;t the law of na|ture, an univer&s;al gloom overwhelms the minds of the people; they are extremely vengeful, and more murders and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations happen then than at any other time. The &s;laves are not compelled to con|form to any of their religious ceremonies or re|&s;trictions; but during the time of Ramadan they are &s;ubjected to the infliction of the &s;evere&s;t pu|ni&s;hments: for &s;uch ab&s;tinence has a tendency to excite the mo&s;t boi&s;terous pa&s;&s;ions of the human brea&s;t.</P>
<P>This fa&s;t is &s;ucceeded by a <HI>Bairam</HI> or fe&s;tival, called the fea&s;t of the breaking of the fa&s;t, which continues for three days, during which time the half &s;tarved Turks riot in the oppo&s;ite extreme of intemperance. They hold a kind of fair out of town, where they divert them&s;elves with drink|ing, fea&s;ting, mu&s;ic, bonfires, wre&s;tling, &s;wing|ing, and feats of hor&s;eman&s;hip. The colours of all nations are di&s;played in the marine, and during this fe&s;tival the &s;laves are exempted from labour.</P>
<P>But their greate&s;t fe&s;tival is on the fifth of Sep|tember, the day of the nativity of their prophet, which is celebrated with great &s;olemnity. All the &s;choolma&s;ters in the city, with their &s;cholars, a&s;|&s;emble at the chief mo&s;que, from which they form a proce&s;&s;ion through the &s;treets, each carrying a burning torch in his hand, and &s;inging an eulo|gy in prai&s;e of their great prophet. Two of the ma&s;ters carry on their &s;houlders a &s;uperb pyramid ornamented with wreathes of flowers, and a cro&s;s on the top of it, and followed by a band of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic after the Turki&s;h manner. All the hou&s;es at the corners of the &s;treets are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="229" REF="032877_0116_0FF5A9F1F689D290">
with tape&s;try and burning lamps. The cooks of the divan to the number of 200 al&s;o form a proce&s;&s;ion, each carrying a clean napkin or towel on his &s;houl|der and a torch in his hand. They parade the &s;treets two by two, from &s;even till eleven o'clock in the day, and the ceremony ends with a hymn in prai&s;e of their prophet, performed with in&s;tru|ments of mu&s;ic before the doors of &s;ome of their great men. About midnight torches are kept burning in every hou&s;e, becau&s;e Mahomet was born at that hour. This fea&s;t continues for eight days, during which time any per&s;on is at liberty to walk the &s;treets at night without a lighted torch, which they cannot do at other times without incur|ring the penalty of corporal puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ingular cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hed here, of a religious nature, for the remi&s;&s;ion of the puni&s;h|ment of offenders who fly to the mo&s;ques for pro|tection, which is called <HI>taking the marabout,</HI> and the&s;e places are an a&s;ylum for every de&s;cription of criminals. In the front of every mo&s;que there is &s;u&s;pended a long chain, which the criminal &s;eizes; whereupon he is generally taken into the &s;anctuary and covered with the marabout's colours, from whence he is not &s;uffered to be taken till his pardon is gran|ted. One of the&s;e chains is &s;u&s;pended in front of the dey's palace, who &s;ometimes pardons offenders who fly thither for refuge, and another is &s;u&s;|pended at the cazarees of the Turks, where crimi|nals are more inviolably protected.</P>
<P>A quarrel took place not long &s;ince between two lads about twelve years of age, the one a Turk and the other a Moor, as they were pa&s;&s;ing from the marine to the city. When they came oppo&s;ite to the cazarees, the young Turk, taking the advan|tage

of the Moori&s;h lad, ran up to him with his drawn tahan, and gave him a wound through the back, of which he in&s;tantly expired, and immedi|ately fled for refuge to the cazarees, where he was protected, till the friends of the Turki&s;h lad pro|cured his pardon by paying the parents of the de|cea&s;ed a &s;um of money as a compen&s;ation for their lo&s;s.</P>
<P>It is a vulgar opinion among the Algerines, and the Mahometans in general, that women have no &s;ouls; or if they have, that they die like tho&s;e of the brutes, and will receive no reward in the next life. This is probably the rea&s;on why they are never &s;uffered to go upon a pilgrimage, or to attend public wor|&s;hip in their mo&s;ques. But whatever may be the vulgar belief&punc; it is evident that Mahomet had too great a re&s;pect for the fair &s;ex, to inculcate &s;uch a doctrine; for there are &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the Alco|coran, which expre&s;ly affirm that women in the next life will not only be puni&s;hed for their evil deeds, but will be rewarded for their virtues as well as men, and that in this re&s;pect God will make no di&s;tinction of &s;exes.</P>
<P>It is true that the general notion is, that they will not be admitted into the &s;ame abode with the men, becau&s;e their places will be &s;upplied by paradi&s;iacal females, but that a &s;eparate place of happine&s;s will be a&s;&s;igned to good women, where they will enjoy every delight in its fulle&s;t extent: yet &s;ome allege that a man will have tho&s;e who were his wives in this world, or at lea&s;t &s;uch of them as he &s;hall de&s;ire. One circum&s;tance with which Mahomet acquainted his followers, ought to corroborate their belief of the future exi&s;tence of the female &s;oul.

<P>Great numbers of the citizens of Algiers perform a journey to Mecca every year, and many ve&s;&s;els are employed in tran&s;porting them to this holy city for the purpo&s;e of manufacturing them into &s;aints. This pilgrimage is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a point in practical religion, that according to a tradition of Mahomet, he who dies without performing it may as well die a Jew or Chri&s;tian. It is deemed a duty particu|cularly incumbent, and the Alcoran expre&s;sly en|joins it upon all tho&s;e who are of &s;ufficient abi|lity to perform the journey<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap.

<P>Mr. Tournefort tells us, that the four places of rendezvous for pilgrims, are Damas, Cairo, Ba|bylon, and Zebir. At the&s;e places they dre&s;s

them&s;elves in the &s;acred habit, which con&s;i&s;ts of two woolen wrappers, one about the middle to co|ver their nakedne&s;s, and the other thrown over their &s;houlders; and in this dre&s;s they enter the &s;acred territory. While they are thus accoutred they are neither &s;uffered to hunt nor to fowl, (though they may fi&s;h) and this precept is punctiliou&s;ly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>During his pilgrimage a man mu&s;t keep a con|&s;tant guard over all his word and actions; he mu&s;t avoid all quarrelling and abu&s;ive language; he mu&s;t refrain from all ob&s;cene di&s;cour&s;e and &s;exual com|merce, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> his whole attention to the pious work in which he is engaged. All the caravans which come from different parts of the Mahometan dominions, concert their mea&s;ures in &s;uch a man|ner that they arrive the &s;ame day at the hill <HI>Ara|fagd,</HI> which is about a day's journey from Mecca: on this celebrated hill they imagine that the angel fir&s;t appeared to their prophet, and in con&s;equence the Mahometans have founded one of their princi|pal &s;anctuaries on this &s;pot.</P>
<P>After having killed and di&s;tributed &s;ome &s;heep a|mong the poor they proceed to Mecca, and from thence to Medina to vi&s;it the tomb of their prophet, which is covered with a magnificent pall, annually &s;ent thither by order of the Grand Signior, which pall is every year cut away by the pilgrims, who e&s;teem the &s;malle&s;t piece of it as the mo&s;t invaluable relic. The Grand Signior al&s;o &s;ends 500 &s;equins, an Alcoran covered with gold, &s;everal rich carpets, and a great many pieces of black cloth for hangings, as pre&s;ents to the mo&s;ques at Mecca. The noble&s;t camel that can be found is cho&s;en to carry this Al|coran, and at his return he is hung with garlands

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Slaves of Algiers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHATEVER &s;peculative maniacs or merce|nary enthu&s;ia&s;ts may allege in favour of &s;lavery, it is obviou&s;ly repugnant to the impre|&s;criptible rights of human nature, and an incon|te&s;tible evidence of the remains of barbari&s;m in tho&s;e nations who &s;anction &s;o diabolical a principle.</P>
<P>There appear to be three &s;tages in the progre&s;s of mankind from &s;avage rudene&s;s to a &s;tate of true re|finement. Fir&s;t, a &s;tate of canibali&s;m, in which any tribe or nation of men deal indi&s;criminate death and de&s;truction among the re&s;t of their fel|low creatures; &s;econd, a &s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion, in which, though they are exempted from the fangs of &s;avage rapacity, yet they are compelled to &s;ub|mit to the lo&s;s of their liberties; third, the eman|cipation of mankind, when the more general diffu|&s;ion of &s;cience will teach them the true principles of ju&s;tice and humanity. But the grand &s;cience of univer&s;al benevolence mu&s;t be re&s;erved for fu|ture ages; for though many modern nations ima|gine them&s;elves to be eminently enlightened, yet they are in fact but ju&s;t beginning to emerge from the intermediate &s;tate between barbarity and true refinement.</P>
<P>For the practice of &s;lavery we are not to repro|bate the Algerines alone; for the divan of Great Britain are equally reprehen&s;ible, and have more
<PB N="235" REF="032877_0119_0FF5AA06ED2046D0">
eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in this nefarious commerce. From them we have adopted the exe|crable practice, and the United States, emphatical|ly called the land of liberty, &s;warm with tho&s;e &s;emi-barbarians who enthral their fellow creatures without the lea&s;t remor&s;e. With what countenance then can we reproach a &s;et of barbarians, who have only retorted our own acts upon our&s;elves in making repri&s;als upon our citizens? For it is ma|nife&s;t to the world, that we are equally culpable, and in whatever terms of opprobrium we may ex|ecrate the piratic di&s;po&s;ition of the Africans, yet all our recriminations will recoil upon our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed thus much, we &s;hall now pro|ceed to make a few ob&s;ervations upon the &s;laves of Algi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, and as a preliminary we &s;hall detail the particulars of the capture of the &s;hip Pre&s;ident, that the public may have &s;ome idea of the&s;e banditti of the ocean.</P>
<P>On the 23d of October 1793, about nine o'clock in the morning, the crew of the &s;hip Pre&s;ident, when they were only within a few hours &s;ail of Cadiz, the port to which they were bound, di&s;co|vered an armed xebeck of 16 guns&punc; under Spani&s;h colours, bearing down upon them; upon which the American flag was immediately hoi&s;ted, and as a very light breeze prevailed it was a con&s;ider|able time before the two ve&s;&s;els were within hail of each other. When the xebeck came within gun-&s;hot of the American ve&s;&s;el &s;he hauled down her Spani&s;h colours, hoi&s;ted the bloody flag, and fired a platoon of &s;mall arms. This circum|&s;tance threw them into the mo&s;t violent con&s;terna|tion imaginable, and their fir&s;t aim was to &s;ecure their clothes, money, and other articles. The pirates &s;oon after hoi&s;ted out their boat, into which
<PB N="236" REF="032877_0120_0FF5AA08756D8D20">
about thirty armed men entered, who rowed with great violence towards the American ve&s;&s;el, which they boarded with pi&s;tols and drawn &s;words, and with the greate&s;t fury and &s;houting imaginable, in order to impre&s;s the minds of the Americans with a conviction of their great intrepidity in a naval attack.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were on deck, they fell foul of the crew like &s;o many ravenous wolves that had broken loo&s;e from their kennel; they tore off their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and the mo&s;t furious &s;cramble &s;ucceeded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> can be conceived; every one being anxious to appropriate mo&s;t of the booty to him&s;elf. One American a&s;&s;ures us that he was &s;eized by no le&s;s than four Algerines at once, who threw him down and &s;tripped him naked; but what evinced the mo&s;t &s;ingular ferocity in human nature, in &s;crambling for his clothes tho&s;e furies came to blows among them|&s;elves; the moment one had torn off his coat, another attempted to wre&s;t it from him, and a bu&s;tle en&s;ued between them. The two that had &s;eized his trow&s;ers tore them in pieces in their &s;truggle for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and a &s;cene of &s;imilar rapacity was acted towards every other American. Every part of the ve&s;&s;el was rifle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> che&s;ts were broken open, and they &s;eized every arti|cle that could be carried off with an avaricious fury, characteri&s;tic of no other nation under heaven.</P>
<P>After they had loaded them&s;elves with plunder, they thru&s;t all the American crew into their boat, in this naked and in&s;ulted condition, at the point of their cutla&s;&s;es; tho&s;e who di&s;covered any reluct|ance, were knocked down and kicked into the boat, where they were trampled under foot by this clan of de&s;paradoes. They were taken on board the xebeck, and another boat's crew immediately returned to take charge of the American ve&s;&s;el.
<PB N="237" REF="032877_0120_0FF5AA08756D8D20">
Here they had the plea&s;ure of being introduced to Rais Mahomet, the commander of the xebeck, an emaciated loath&s;ome figure, who &s;at &s;moking his pipe upon a &s;heep-&s;kin, and &s;ipping a di&s;h of coffee which was placed before him. It is not a little &s;ur|prizing, that &s;uch a mi&s;erable object &s;hould be ap|pointed to the command of a cor&s;air, and this cir|cum&s;tance mu&s;t evince the futility of their naval policy. He appeared to be upwards of a hun|dred years old, and through age and impotency, was &s;carcely able to &s;upport a tottering frame. His hands were pal&s;ied; his eyes &s;unk deep in his head, and through weakne&s;s dripped a continual flow of tears. From his gha&s;tly vi&s;age flowed a beard of the brighte&s;t &s;ilver, except where it was &s;ullied by the drippings of his coffee, and an involuntary di&s;|charge of &s;pittle. His voice was &s;carcely audible, and in his exterior he re&s;embled &s;ome old hermit, that had been immured a hundred ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&punc;</P>
<P>Such was the commander of the Algerine xe|beck. When they had fea&s;ted their curio&s;ity up|on this very venerable figure, their attention was turned to their new quarters, which they &s;urveyed with new a&s;toni&s;hment. Nearly a hundred and fifty Algerines were crowded into this ve&s;&s;el, and whatever de&s;cription can be drawn by the mo&s;t fer|tile imagination, of lice, fleas, filth and &s;tench, was here nearly reali&s;ed. Their decks were never &s;uf|fered to be &s;wept or wa&s;hed, and they &s;eemed to pre&s;erve their dirt with a kind of veneration. The&s;e delicate planks they &s;ub&s;tituted for tables, upon which they ate their provi&s;ions, which con&s;i&s;ted of olives, bread, vinegar and oil. When they had fini&s;h|ed their meals, they threw part of the fragments overboard, and the remainder was trampled into the general ma&s;s of filth.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="032877_0121_0FF5AA18C8B29000">
As &s;oon as they had &s;ecured their prize, the mo&s;t extravagant mirth and boi&s;terous exultation &s;uc|ceeded; to commemorate the event a &s;heep was &s;a|crificed, and after be&s;mearing the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el with its blood, they concluded the ceremony by devouring its fle&s;h.</P>
<P>After the termination of this fe&s;tivity, the pri|&s;oners were arraigned on deck, and a &s;econd &s;trip|ping took place. Tho&s;e who had not been depri|ved of all their clothes at fir&s;t, were now &s;tripped naked, and in their &s;tead they were accommodated with a few dirty rags, which had been the refu&s;e of this lou&s;y crew. By Mahomet's order, the clothes of the captives were all thrown together in a heap, and &s;old at public vendue.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t laborious part of duty in the xebeck was then a&s;&s;igned to the Americans, and the pirates, &s;olely intent upon &s;ecuring their prize, immediately &s;tood in for the &s;treights without looking out for fur|ther plunder. In their pa&s;&s;age the Americans could not help remarking the continual dread and appre|hen&s;ion of the&s;e free-booters, who were continu|ally looking out with their gla&s;&s;es, and like a band of thieves who were con&s;cious of the villany of their profe&s;&s;ion, they trembled with the mo&s;t vi&s;ible con&s;ternation at every &s;ail that hove in &s;ight. The Americans repre&s;ent the&s;e pirates as the mo&s;t undi&s;|ciplined and pu&s;ilanimous &s;ailors in the world, and in|&s;i&s;t that the mo&s;t incon&s;iderate naval force with Briti&s;h di&s;cipline, is &s;ufficient to defeat or keep any of them at bay. The greate&s;t di&s;play of Algerine bravery, is at the commencement of an engagement, when they endeavour to intimidate their enemies, like the American &s;avages, with the mo&s;t horrible yells.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the &s;ame day the Pre&s;ident was captured they fell in with a Briti&s;h frigate, when the
<PB N="239" REF="032877_0121_0FF5AA18C8B29000">
Americans were ordered below, and on the &s;econd day with a Briti&s;h merchantman, with whom they had before been in company without the &s;treights, whom they reque&s;ted to publi&s;h an account of their capture at the fir&s;t port they touched.</P>
<P>On their pa&s;&s;age up the &s;treights they had it fre|quently in contemplation to ri&s;e upon the Algerine crew, to di&s;arm tho&s;e upon watch, and to confine the re&s;t below by &s;ecuring the hatches; but their &s;mall number deterred them from &s;uch an attempt.</P>
<P>On the 30th of October they arrived at Algiers, and were taken a&s;hore to the vichelhadge's &s;kiff, where they were attended by the dey's <HI>&s;crivan</HI> or head clerk, who conducted them to the palace. Here they were lodged in an outer court, which had been occupied as a kind of black-&s;mith's &s;hop, where they were refre&s;hed with a me&s;s of cuzcuz, and after re|po&s;ing the fir&s;t night upon &s;ome &s;acks of &s;traw, they were ordered to the Bagnio Baleck.</P>
<P>When the crews of the American ve&s;&s;els were captured they were entirely &s;tripped of their dre&s;s, and pre&s;ented in exchange with a parcel of old rags and a pair of coar&s;e trow&s;ers, which only reached down to their knees. They laboured for &s;everal months in this wretched apparel, which was not &s;ufficient to protect them from the rays of a &s;corching &s;un, till at length each captive was ac|commodated by the United States with a hat and a &s;uit of blue clothes, which were &s;ent them from Alicant by Mr. Montgomery the American con&s;ul; a provi&s;ion which they received annually while they continued in this mi&s;erable abode. They were al&s;o furni&s;hed with money, which had been depo&s;ited by Mr. Humphreys at Alicant, and tran&s;|mitted to the Swedi&s;h con&s;ul in Algiers, upon whom the American captains drew every month for the
<PB N="240" REF="032877_0122_0FF5AA1A51729938">
&s;ums that were &s;everally allotted to the captives. To each private there was granted an allowance of 3 dollars and 75 cents, to each mate 6 dollars, and to each captain 8 dollars per month&mdash;a very unju&s;t di&s;tinction, e&s;pecially as the privates were &s;ubjected to much greater hard&s;hips than either the captains or mates. By this allowance their &s;itua|tion was rendered le&s;s deplorable, and they were enabled to procure a &s;upper of meat every night, in&s;tead of the black bread and oil with which they were daily furni&s;hed. It is ob&s;ervable that no na|tion made any provi&s;ion for their en&s;laved coun|trymen but the United States, and in con&s;equence the Turks gave them the appellation of <HI>cavalero,</HI> or gentlemen.</P>
<P>Every public &s;lave wore an iron ring round his ancle, which was always an evidence of his belong|ing to the public, and no Turk could mole&s;t or even in&s;ult a &s;lave of this de&s;cription with impunity; but this badge was not conferred upon the private &s;laves. To this ring was fa&s;tened a chain with long links, which was bound round their body to pre|vent their e&s;cape whenever foreign ve&s;&s;els lay is the harbour.</P>
<P>When there is a public ran&s;om of &s;laves there is no difference in the price between the officers and men, but in private ran&s;oms the dey demands 4000 dollars for each captain and mate, and 2000 dol|lars for every private. All &s;laves who die after the conclu&s;ion of treaties are paid for, and the dey ex|acted the u&s;ual &s;ums for all the American captives who died after the 5th of September 1796.</P>
<P>When a cor&s;air takes a prize he carries the captives directly to the palace of the dey, where the Euro|pean con&s;uls a&s;&s;emble, to &s;ee if any of the pri&s;on|ers
<PB N="241" REF="032877_0122_0FF5AA1A51729938">
belong to their re&s;pective nations, who are at peace with Algiers. In that ca&s;e they reclaim them, provided they were only pa&s;&s;engers; but if they have &s;erved on board of the &s;hips of any people at war with this regency, they cannot be di&s;charged without payment of the full ran&s;om.</P>
<P>The deys formerly had their choice only of ev|ery eighth &s;lave, and they generally cho&s;e the ma&s;|ters, &s;urgeons, carpenters, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful hands belonging to the &s;everal prizes, be&s;ides per&s;ons of quality, for whom they expected a large ran&s;om; but at pre&s;ent it &s;eems that the dey is entitled to any number he thinks proper to make choice of, who are generally employed in menial offices about the pa|lace. He al&s;o is entitled to all captured ve&s;&s;els and their cargoes, and the rais or captains generally re|ceive, be&s;ides their monthly pay, a certain premium, or extra-compen&s;ation from the dey for every cap|tured ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The remainder of the &s;laves are &s;ent into the &s;ervice of the public; but if they can procure a little mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ey from their friends, or borrow any of the Jews upon exorbitant intere&s;t, they are permitted to keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|verns, they paying to the dey a certain duty in pro|portion to the wine they &s;ell; and notwith&s;tanding this intere&s;t and duty, many have managed &s;o well as to rai&s;e money enough to purcha&s;e their liberty, and to carry away a quantity be&s;ides: for they are allow|ed a property in what they get. To the&s;e taverns re&s;ort Turks, Moors, and Chri&s;tians promi&s;cuou&s;ly. But a Mu&s;&s;ulman would not keep one of the&s;e ta|verns for the world him&s;elf, and con&s;equently they are kept by Chri&s;tians and Jews. And a tavern-keeper, though a &s;lave, is empowered to &s;trip any of his gue&s;ts, even the Turks them&s;elves, if they re|fu&s;e
<PB N="242" REF="032877_0123_0FF5AA1BD8EB9F98">
to pay their reckoning; and herein he is pro|tected by the dey him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The condition of tho&s;e who are &s;laves to private individuals, depends very much upon the di&s;po&s;i|tion of their ma&s;ter, and the &s;laves' own conduct. Some of them fare better in Algiers, than ever they did in their own countries, and if they are good for any thing, are entertained rather as compani|ons than &s;ervants; though by far the greater num|ber are barbarous ma&s;ters, who treat their &s;laves with great cruelty, and per&s;ons of quality, or tho&s;e who are &s;u&s;pected to be in affluent circum&s;tances, experience a greater &s;everity of treatment, in order that they may be compelled to redeem them&s;elves at an extraordinary price. Their female &s;laves are &s;ent to the dey's &s;eraglio, where they are made con|cubines, or &s;ubjected to dome&s;tic &s;ervices, unle&s;s a con&s;iderable ran&s;om is expected for them; or if young they are &s;old to &s;uch as want them for the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>They neither force nor tempt any of the Chri&s;ti|an &s;laves to change their religion; as it is not their intere&s;t that they &s;hould be made converts: for in that ca&s;e they lo&s;e the benefit of their ran&s;oms. The Chri&s;tians who are free, generally fare wor&s;e than the &s;laves; becau&s;e the imperious Turks make it a point to in&s;ult and abu&s;e them; but they dare not abu&s;e the &s;laves, becau&s;e their ma&s;ters will re&s;ent it and demand &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;laves who are &s;old into the country are &s;ubjected to peculiar hard&s;hips. They are compel|led to carry all kinds of burdens to market, and if they do not render a &s;atisfactory account of the arti|cles entru&s;ted to their care, they are &s;ure to be beaten. Some of the&s;e &s;laves go naked in the fields where they tend cattle, drag ploughs, and do all other kinds of the mo&s;t &s;ervile drudgery.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="032877_0123_0FF5AA1BD8EB9F98">
Many were formerly con&s;igned to the galleys chained by one leg, and fed on water and hard bi&s;|cuit, and beaten with a large cow-&s;kin. When they were on &s;hore they were locked up at night in dungeons called <HI>Ma&s;mora,</HI> where they lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the bare earth. But at pre&s;ent no &s;laves are confined to the galleys, becau&s;e they have &s;o frequently made their e&s;cape, or murdered their commanders, and &s;et them&s;elves at liberty.</P>
<P>While the Americans were en&s;laved in Algiers, the mo&s;t exaggerated accounts were circulated re&s;|pecting the &s;everity of their afflictions. It was re|ported that the tongues of &s;ome were cut out, that others were ema&s;culated; and captain Lawrence of the Hull Packet, who is &s;aid to have obtained his information at Cadiz, informs us that the Ame|ricans had their heads &s;haved clo&s;e, and were not permitted to wear any kind of covering on their heads. Their calamities were indeed without a pa|rallel, but the above accounts were entirely un|founded.</P>

or rather cables, of &s;ufficient &s;trength to drag them, and three or four hundred &s;laves, and &s;ometimes a greater number, are engaged in rolling one of the&s;e &s;tones upon a <HI>carette,</HI> or &s;trong four wheel car|riage, in order to tran&s;port it to the mole.</P>
<P>The Turks make the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing noi&s;e, not only in the removal of the&s;e &s;tones, but in mo|ving any weight whatever which requires a number of hands.

<P>When they have launched the&s;e unweildy ma&s;|&s;es of &s;tone upon the carriages, the cables are fix|ed to them, and four files of &s;laves are compelled, like &s;o many bea&s;ts of burden, to drag them from the mountain to the city. In their pa&s;&s;age they are obliged to a&s;cend a &s;teep hill, where their utmo&s;t efforts are &s;ometimes in&s;ufficient to drag the enor|mous weight. The &s;everity of their toils in at|taining the &s;ummit of this hill is &s;ometimes incon|ceivable; the &s;un pours down the mo&s;t intolerable heat upon them, and they are drenched in &s;weat, and involved in clouds of du&s;t which attend them in their pa&s;&s;age. Thus many become perfectly exhau&s;ted with their toils; and to complete the climax of their &s;ufferings, their brutal over&s;eers, the wardens, &s;courge them for the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ne&s;s with the mo&s;t &s;avage &s;everity.</P>
<P>When they have a&s;cended the hill, it is nece&s;|&s;ary to rever&s;e the ropes, and their utmo&s;t efforts are then required to prevent the carette from de|&s;cending
<PB N="245" REF="032877_0124_0FF5AA1D5E621F38">
the hill with the greate&s;t rapidity. Thus, after great labour and difficulty, they tran&s;port the&s;e &s;tones to the wharf, where the pantoons are moored, which is about a league from the moun|tain, and a &s;tone's throw from the walls of the city. Here they depo&s;it them, and by means of pulleys and a kind of &s;leds, which de&s;cend upon gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d pieces of timber, they di&s;charge them into the pantoons, which convey them to the mole.</P>
<P>The&s;e pantoons are nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the narrow|ne&s;s of the &s;treets renders the pa&s;&s;age of the&s;e huge &s;tones through the city impracticable. They are a &s;pecies of large flat bottomed boats, that cover about as much water as a &s;eventy-four gun &s;hip. They have low gunwhales, and long pieces of timber are nailed acro&s;s the deck, to prevent the great pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;tones from-injuring the planks. They ge|nerally carry three or four of the&s;e huge &s;tones at a load, with a number of &s;maller ones, which are di&s;tributed over different parts of the deck.</P>
<P>The pantoons are navigated by ca&s;ting anchors and cables a-head. Fifty or &s;ixty &s;laves are nece&s;&s;a|ry to man them, and by means of the&s;e cables and anchors, which are continually carried a-head as oc|ca&s;ion requires, they warp the pantoons to the mole. In their pa&s;&s;age they are &s;ometimes &s;ubjected to great danger from &s;udden &s;qualls of wind, which either blow them out to &s;ea, or wreck them on the &s;hore. When this happens the greate&s;t bu&s;tle ima|ginable en&s;ues, and the clamour of the Turks is &s;uch, that one would &s;uppo&s;e that the city it&s;elf was upon the verge of de&s;truction. The &s;tones are di&s;|charged at the mole by means of a <HI>&s;kyler,</HI> which is a kind of platform re&s;embling the leaf of a table, projecting from the &s;tern of the pantoon, and low|ered
<PB N="246" REF="032877_0125_0FF5AA2D85B55590">
by pulleys; upon this the &s;tones are placed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by means of crowbars, and depo&s;ited up|on &s;uch parts of the mole as the &s;ea makes the great|e&s;t impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus have the fooli&s;h Turks continued this fruit|le&s;s labour for upwards of 250 years, without hav|ing conceived the project of forming a wall of &s;uffi|cient &s;trength to defend the mole from the violence, of the waves; but it is &s;aid that the dey has now &s;uch a project in contemplation, which he intends &s;hortly to put in execution.</P>
<P>The impetuo&s;ity of the &s;ea has a continual ten|dency to bury the&s;e &s;tones in the &s;and. An ea&s;tern, or as it is called a Levant wind will roll &s;uch a heavy &s;ea into the harbour, that in the cour&s;e of three or four days, the labour of a whole &s;ea&s;on will be &s;wept away. The &s;ea at &s;uch times breaks with great violence over the mole, and even the walls of the magazines are &s;ometimes nearly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Two pantoons and two carettes, with a gang of &s;laves to each of them, are employed in tran&s;port|ing the&s;e &s;tones, and the carettes generally bring each two loads in a day.</P>
<P>Many &s;laves are employed at other places in the country. Some at a mountain called Bubazoon, &s;ome at the gardens of different con&s;uls, who re|&s;ide in the country, and others in the marine. But on Fridays they are ordered to Bublywhite, where the vickelhadge and warden ba&s;haws attend, and where, on tho&s;e days, there is a general collection of all the &s;laves.</P>
<P>After they fini&s;h their daily&punc; labour they all repair to town to their common lodgings the bagnios, where they are locked up every night, and prohibited all intercour&s;e with the citizens. The private &s;laves are not, however, deprived of this privilege, and they
<PB N="247" REF="032877_0125_0FF5AA2D85B55590">
are permitted to walk the &s;treets at night, provid|ed they conform to the common cu&s;tom of carrying a light with them, without which every per&s;on is &s;ubject to being arre&s;ted by the watchmen of the city, and to cha&s;ti&s;ement by the ba&s;tinado.</P>
<P>In the bagnios, the chief aim of the &s;laves is to drown the reflection of their abject &s;ituation by the mo&s;t cheerful conver&s;ation. They have few a|mu&s;ements here to divert their attention; but &s;ome of them, when they have lei&s;ure, follow their pro|fe&s;&s;ions, in order to obtain a little money. The principal &s;tudy of the more humorous Ameri|cans, was to di&s;pel the gloom of their companions and to excite one another to laughter by ludicrous and &s;atirical remarks upon their &s;ituation. Some of them played upon the violin, and frequently af|ter the toils of the day, they would divert them|&s;elves all night by dancing, drinking and &s;inging, in order to bani&s;h the reflection of &s;lavery. In their frolics they were often very clamorous, and interrupted the repo&s;e of the whole bagnio; at which time &s;ome of the &s;laves would often lodge complaints again&s;t them, and the corporal would then put an end to the frolic by ordering them to retire to re&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;laves are let out of the bagnios at an early hour in the morning, and they proceed to their labour with pen&s;ive hearts and reluctant &s;teps. When they are employed in the marine they repair every morn|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o a place near the gate of Babazira, which opens to the harbour, where they are paraded in files along the platforms of the hou&s;es on each &s;ide of the &s;treet. Here they wait the arrival of the vickelhadge, who &s;oon makes his appearance, and as he pa&s;&s;es between them they are compelled to pull off their hats as a token of re&s;pect. After him a proce&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="248" REF="032877_0126_0FF5AA2F2FA01BB0">
&s;laves is immediately formed, and as he takes his &s;eat in the &s;kiff, a trumpet is &s;ounded from the marine. They are then embarked on board the Baleck boats, which are kept for the purpo&s;e, and tran&s;ported to the crui&s;ers which are &s;tationed in different parts of the harbour.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the marine is the lea&s;t laborious employment of the &s;laves. But even here they are &s;ubjected at times to great hard&s;hips, and e&s;pecially when an expedition is on foot; at which time they are compelled to labour all night in making the ne|ce&s;&s;ary preparations for the crui&s;e. The &s;hore is il|luminated with lamps, and Turki&s;h guards are &s;tati|oned on the mole, and in other parts, to prevent their e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Their food con&s;i&s;ts of bread, oil, and vinegar. To each per&s;on is di&s;tributed two &s;mall loaves of about half a pound each, and a jill of oil a day. The&s;e articles are brought to Bublywhite by mule|teers, who are daily employed in carrying pro|vi&s;ions to the &s;laves. The bread is of the mo&s;t in|different quality, and is made of unboulted meal, ground in mills in the city which are turned by hor&s;es. The general employment of the mul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|teers, be&s;ides carrying provi&s;ions to the &s;laves, is conveying lime into the city from the lime-kilns in the country, for the purpo&s;es of building and white-wa&s;hing hou&s;es.</P>
<P>All the fick among the &s;laves who are incapa|ble of labour are &s;ent to the ho&s;pital oppo&s;ite to the Bagnio Baleck, which will accommodate a|bout fifty. This in&s;titution is &s;upported at the expence of the Spani&s;h nation, and is under the &s;uperintendance of a phy&s;ician and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Spani&s;h prie&s;ts. Here they are well accomm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ted with beds, and furni&s;hed with provi&s;ions in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eef and
<PB N="249" REF="032877_0126_0FF5AA2F2FA01BB0">
bread, and medicines are pre&s;cribed according to their &s;everal complaints. The upper apartments of this ho&s;pital are occupied by &s;uch as have the plague, and the lower parts by tho&s;e who are confi|ned with other di&s;orders. It is &s;aid that the &s;upport of this ho&s;pital co&s;ts the Spani&s;h nation 40,000 dollars per annum, which are annualy tran&s;mitted to Algiers for this benevolent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been reported that the officers and men of the American ve&s;&s;els were treated with equal &s;everity; but this was a mi&s;take. Neither the A|merican captains nor mates were &s;ubjected to the labour of the common &s;laves; but were employed in the &s;ail-loft in making &s;ails, or in boring pumps for ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ometimes after lazar in the after|noon they were &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t in unloading the pan|toons. This was the general routine of busine&s;s a&s;&s;igned to the captains and mates of ve&s;&s;els; but the &s;ailors were indi&s;criminately empolyed in every kind of labour.</P>
<P>The Americans &s;upported the be&s;t characters of any &s;laves in Algiers, and the mo&s;t of them could always obtain credit in the bagnios for wine and other liquors; a favour that was conferred upon nei|ther Turks nor Moors, of whom the tavern-keep|ers were always obliged to be extremely watchful; otherwi&s;e they would frequently &s;teal away without pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing for the liquors they drank.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t turbulent of the &s;laves are the Spani|ards, who frequently quarrel at night, and fight in the bagnios with drawn daggers; at which times the corporals &s;ettle di&s;turbances among them with a &s;hort rope with a knot in the end, or confine them in chains till morning.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;laves who have incurred the penalty of death are generally executed at the fountain in front
<PB N="250" REF="032877_0127_0FF5AA30C045CB30">
of the dey's palace, where the Turki&s;h execution|ers attend. The criminal is made to kneel down; one of the Turks then touches him on the back part of the head, and as he turns round to &s;ee what was the cau&s;e, the other with a &s;harp &s;word at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;evers his head from his &s;houlders. After the execution, the blood is wa&s;hed through the ground into the common &s;ewer, and his body is buried in the &s;and near the &s;ea &s;hore, as they are not &s;uffered the privilege of a Mahometan burial.</P>
<P>The American captives generally bore their &s;ufferings with great fortitude, and conducted them|&s;elves with &s;uperior decorum; but notwith&s;tanding, frequent and &s;evere puni&s;hments were inflicted upon them for the mo&s;t trivial remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and a thou&s;and inadvertencies, which are natural to tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to the enjoyment of their liberties.</P>
<P>Soon after their arrival in Algiers they drew up an affecting addre&s;s to Colonel Humphreys, who re|&s;ided at Madrid, which was duly an&s;wered; and as this corre&s;pondence details &s;ome particulars that have not been hitherto enumerated, we &s;hall clo&s;e the pre&s;ent chapter with its in&s;ertion.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Particular anecdotes, occurrences and occa&s;ional remarks, which throw &s;ome additional light upon the hi&s;tory, cu&s;toms and manners of the Algerines.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;lave to e&s;cape from Algiers by land: for if he is di&s;covered by the Moors he is apprehended and brought back to the city, where they receive a reward for their trouble. Tho&s;e that can get on board of French or Engli&s;h &s;hips ob|tain their liberties, and no demand is made upon the commanders to deliver them up: and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> ever foreign ve&s;&s;els lie in the habour all the &s;la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> who work in the marine are obliged to wear heavy&punc; chains. But by water many &s;laves have e&s;caped, and the Algerines have in con&s;equence become &s;o extremely vigilant, that an e&s;cape is now almo&s;t im|practicable.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="anecdote">
<HEAD>Attempt of fifteen &s;laves to e&s;cape.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the American captives were employed at Bublywhite, a &s;cheme was concerted between fif|teen Genoe&s;e, Portugue&s;e, and Neapolitan &s;laves, to make their e&s;cape in one of the boats that at|tend the pantoons. This plot had been in agita|tion for &s;everal weeks, and in the mean time they
<PB N="256" REF="032877_0130_0FF5AA4287EE3E30">
had prepared them&s;elves with weapons of defence, and all nece&s;&s;ary articles for their voyage. About nine o'clock one very hot morning, in the time of Ramadan, while <HI>Montenegro,</HI> the warden of the pantoon, lay a&s;leep, the&s;e fifteen &s;laves, at the word of command, jumped into the boat which lay along &s;ide the pantoon, and put to &s;ea in an in&s;tant. The portezero, or boat&s;wain of the pan|toon, immediately waked Montenegro, who was a&s;toni&s;hed beyond mea&s;ure when he &s;aw them under weigh, and hallowed to them in a furious tone of voice to return; upon which one of the Portugue&s;e waved his naked &s;word in defi|ance, the crew gave three loud huzzas, and rowed with all their might towards the Spani&s;h coa&s;t. Montenegro, dreading the con&s;equences of this piece of neglect, immediately fled for &s;afety to the grand mo&s;que which &s;tands out of the town.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the news was announced to the dey, he ordered men to be &s;tationed on eminences with &s;py-gla&s;&s;es, to ob&s;erve the cour&s;e they &s;teered; and in the mean time a Spani&s;h built boat, a &s;wift runner (which is always moored near the &s;eat of the vichelhadge of the marine to be in readine&s;s upon any particular emergency) was in&s;tantly or|dered to pur&s;ue them. The vichelhadge manned the boat with a double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire of pi&s;corees, or rowers, and that they might pur&s;ue them with greater ex|pedition he embarked himself. By this time the fugitives were out of &s;ight; but the pi&s;corees &s;teered directly towards that part of the ocean where they had di&s;appeared. The vichelhadge, in order to encourage them to greater exertions, frequently threw them money, and they rowed with &s;uch expedition that about noon they over|took the fugitives, who had &s;o completely exhau&s;ted
<PB N="257" REF="032877_0130_0FF5AA4287EE3E30">
them&s;elves in their endeavours to e&s;cape, that they were &s;carcely able to move their oars.

<HEAD>Di&s;appointment of the American &s;laves.</HEAD>
<P>SOME time in 1795 an Engli&s;h cutter from Gib|ralter arrived in Algiers with a number of &s;mall pieces of bra&s;s cannon, which were purcha&s;ed by the dey and carried to his palace. The American &s;laves, who were then at work in the marine, &s;oon recogni&s;ed &s;everal per&s;ons of their former acquain|tance among the crew of the cutter. A general inti|macy took place, and they &s;ympathi&s;ed &s;o feelingly for the di&s;tre&s;s of the Americans, that a &s;cheme was concerted among them to effect their deliver|ance from this region of mi&s;ery. The crew deeply intere&s;ted them&s;elves in the accompli&s;hment of this project, and communicated their intentions to their captain, who perfectly approved of their plan, and promi&s;ed every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power to facilitate their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme devi&s;ed between the parties was as follows: The Americans were to take the advan|tage of the fir&s;t fair wind, and in either going to, or returning from their labour in the marine, ac|cording as the wind &s;hould favor them, they were to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Baleck boats which tran&s;|ported them, and in&s;tantly row them&s;elves on board the cutter; which being a very &s;wift &s;ailing ve&s;&s;el would &s;oon have wa&s;ted them beyond the reach of their pur&s;uers. The in&s;tant they had boarded the cutter they were to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her apparently by force, and the Briti&s;h crew were to affect a re|&s;i&s;tance, that the dey might entertain no &s;u&s;picion of their being privy to the con&s;piracy.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="032877_0133_0FF5AA47259CE030">
The cutter was in con&s;equence put into com|plete order, and the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions were given that they might ca&s;t off and get under weigh in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>No &s;laves were perhaps ever pre&s;ented with &s;o favorable an opportunity as the pre&s;ent. But the mo&s;t &s;ingular occurrence imaginable fru&s;trated the whole &s;cheme, when it was upon the point of exe|cution.</P>
<P>The captain of the cutter, on the day of their intended departure, went up to one of the bagnios in the city, were he accidentally fell in company with two renegado Iri&s;hmen of his acquaintance, who were dre&s;&s;ed, as u&s;ual, in the Turki&s;h habit. It was re&s;olved of cour&s;e to celebrate this unexpec|ted interview with a cour&s;e of wine; and they drank till they were all pretty well intoxicated. While they were in this animated mood they found them&s;elves &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed for adventures, that one of the renegados made a propo&s;al to vi&s;it &s;ome of the Algerine courtezans, which was immediate|ly acceded to, and our captain, who was not, as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, over burthened with cir|cum&s;pection, was conducted to a Moori&s;h brothel in the upper parts of the city, where the&s;e Iri&s;h|men had previou&s;ly formed an acquaintance. Some of the li&s;beros, who had &s;u&s;pected their de|&s;igns, &s;ecretly watched their motions, and di&s;cov|ered the retreat of our frolic&s;ome adventurers. Soon after their entry the&s;e li&s;beros ru&s;hed into the bro|thel, and &s;urpri&s;ed our amorous captain and his friends in the height of their mirth. He was in&s;tantly &s;eized and carried before the dey, who &s;entenced him to immediate execution; but as he was pre|paring to receive the reward of his folly, the Bri|ti&s;h con&s;ul, who had received intelligence of the
<PB N="263" REF="032877_0133_0FF5AA47259CE030">
event, interceded in his behalf, and the dey re|mitted the &s;entence, upon condition that he in&s;tant|ly took his departure from Algiers. In con&s;e|quence he was e&s;corted on board his cutter, which was ordered immediately out of the harbour, and &s;he was not even permitted to remain to take in the lea&s;t balla&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus was this &s;cheme mo&s;t completely defeated by this trivial incident, and the hopes of the A|mericans entirely fru&s;trated. When they &s;aw the departure of the cutter, and were informed of the captain's folly, they were thrown into a &s;tate of inconceivable de&s;pondency. The mo&s;t fortunate breeze imaginable prevailed when they returned from the marine; but in&s;tead of triumphing in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their liberties, they were obliged to re|tire to the gloomy cells of the bagnio, to indulge at lei&s;ure the poignancy of their reflections.</P>
<P>The&s;e renegados were afterwards bani&s;hed to Tu|nis; not becau&s;e their intercour&s;e with the Moori&s;h women was prohibited, (for the renegados are not deprived of this privilege) but becau&s;e they had been acce&s;&s;ory to an infraction of the law. All the Turks were greatly rejoiced at this event, becau&s;e the&s;e turbulent Iri&s;hmen were a terror to all that frequented the bagnios and other public places in the city.</P>

<P>About three hundred paces from the &s;hore &s;tood a &s;mall i&s;land, that was joined to the city by a mole which was fini&s;hed in the year 1533, and intended for the protection of ve&s;&s;els. This mole was carried away by a violent tempe&s;t in the be|ginning of the year 1662, which occa&s;ioned im|men&s;e de&s;truction among the &s;hipping.</P>
<P>Without the city there were &s;everal incon&s;ider|able fortre&s;&s;es; the principal of which was that built by Ha&s;&s;an Ba&s;haw in the year 1545 at the place where Charles V. pitched his tent in 1541. This fortre&s;s is &s;till in exi&s;tence, and is called the <HI>imperial ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>The inhabitants amounted to about 100,000; of which 12,000 were Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, 30,000 &s;laves of various nations, and the remainder citizens of Algiers, who con&s;i&s;ted of Moors, More&s;cos, Jews, and &s;ome Chri&s;tian merchants.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme authority was, as at pre&s;ent, ve&s;ted in the dey, or, as he was then called, the ba&s;haw, who was frequently honored with the appellation of <HI>Sultan,</HI> with which he was highly plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>His &s;ituation appears to have been more precarious then than at pre&s;ent, and he was in continual appre|hen&s;ion of mutiny among the Turki&s;h &s;oldiers; e&s;pe|cially if their monthly wages were withheld. His principal &s;tudy, therefore, was to make punctual pay|ments at every new moon, and if he delayed the&s;e payments three hours after they were due, he was in great danger either of being murdered or impri|&s;oned.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="032877_0144_0FF5AA84677DD918">
The dey was obliged to be very circum&s;pect in taking no more than his due proportion of all prizes; for otherwi&s;e he was in danger of immedi|ate execution by an incen&s;ed &s;oldiery; as happen|ed in September 1661, when Ramadan Ba&s;haw, who then pre&s;ided, adjudged to him&s;elf a great|er proportion of prize-wheat than was his due. This proceeding cau&s;ed an immediate in&s;urrection of the &s;oldiers, who cut his throat, and ma&s;&s;acred twenty-eight of the divan, who&s;e bodies were thrown to the dogs in the &s;treets. The re&s;t were obliged to make their e&s;cape in a fi&s;hing boat, to avoid the fury of the &s;oldiers, in which they were afterwards captured by the Malte&s;e and made &s;laves.</P>
<P>After the death of Ramadan, another Ba&s;haw, whom they had impri&s;oned &s;ome years before for neglect in making punctual payments, was brought out and elected to the &s;overeignty of Algiers, whom they exhorted to a more virtuous conduct in admin|i&s;tration.</P>
<P>But within three days after, he forgot their in|junctions, and meditated nothing but the de&s;truction of an aga, who had been acce&s;&s;ory to his impri&s;on|ment. In the execution of this de&s;ign he promi&s;ed 10,000 patacoons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The patacoon is a Spani&s;h coin about 84 cents in value.</NOTE> to two &s;oldiers if they would murder him. With this intention they went to the aga's hou&s;e, and reque&s;ted to &s;peak with him. But the &s;lave who came out, &s;u&s;pecting their inten|tions by their countenances, an&s;wered that his ma&s;|ter was not at home.</P>
<P>When intelligence was announced to the aga of the dey's de&s;igns, he urged a complaint to the &s;ol|diers, who &s;eized him and threw him into a dark dungeon, where he received his food through a &s;mall hole, and only had room enough to &s;it down.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="032877_0145_0FF5A9A35D6C8C08">
The nece&s;&s;ity of punctual payment, often obliged the dey to procure money by every &s;ini&s;ter means in his power: even by the violation or mi&s;con&s;truction of treaties. And this imperious nece&s;&s;ity induced him to ri&s;k a rupture with Great Britain in 1661, by making prize (contrary to their treaty of peace) of the property and per&s;ons of foreigners that had been &s;hipped on board of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els. In con&s;equence of this infraction of the treaty, the earl of Sand|wick was di&s;patched to Algiers, with a fleet of eigh|teen &s;ail of the line, to demand re&s;titution. The ad|miral entered the harbour the 22d of Augu&s;t, and di&s;patched his lieutenant with his credentials on &s;hore to demand &s;atisfaction, which the dey and divan were not di&s;po&s;ed to grant. In con&s;equence, the Briti&s;h con&s;ul was brought on board the fleet, and the admiral, after pouring a volley of grape &s;hot into the city, and battering down &s;everal hou&s;es, took his departure.</P>
<P>The principal &s;tudy of the dey was the con|&s;tant practice of impo&s;ition upon nations with whom he was in alliance. Their ve&s;&s;els were frequent|ly &s;eized, and the captains con&s;trained, by corporal puni&s;hment, to confe&s;s that the property belonged to other nations. Indeed it was an arduous ta&s;k for him to avoid foreign di&s;putes, and at the &s;ame time promote harmony at home. He was &s;en&s;i|ble that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace with other na|tions would have a tendency to abridge his per|qui&s;ites, and a want of finances to di&s;charge the nece&s;&s;ary demands, would expo&s;e him to the fury of a mutinous &s;oldiery. Treaties of peace were therefore nece&s;&s;arily violated, and as he derived the principal part of his revenue from captured ve&s;&s;els, he was &s;eldom at peace with any na|tion.</P>

The 12,000 men that con&s;tituted his ordinary forces, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the refu&s;e of Turkey, and of renegados who had fled for refuge from Europe; for Algiers was &s;uch a perfect a&s;ylum for villany, that even tho&s;e who had offended the Grand Signior him&s;elf found protection upon their arrival there, as was the ca&s;e in 1640.</P>
<P>One Sigala, the &s;on of a Genoe&s;e renegado a famous admiral of the &s;ame name, had been ap|pointed to the command of a &s;quadron of galleys belonging to the Grand Signior Morad IV. which brought home the annual tribute of Egypt. Sigala on his return anchored his fleet in &s;ome of the ports of Greece, where he went on &s;hore to devote part of his time to the women. While he was here indulg|ing him&s;elf in every gratification, the Malte&s;e ran into the port, and captured the ve&s;&s;el which was freighted with the trea&s;ure. Sigala, to avoid the bow &s;tring, &s;et &s;ail immediately with his galley to Algiers, where he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by piracy till he was pardoned by Ibrahim the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Morad.</P>
<P>Algiers was at this time a kind of military re|public, and the dey was &s;o perfectly under the con|troul of the &s;oldiery, that without their concurrence he could do nothing. If they approved of his or|ders they were executed, and if not, the dey was compelled to relinqui&s;h them.</P>
<P>In the year 1642, a tributory king, refu&s;ing to pay tribute, appeared with an army to &s;hake off the Algerine yoke. Yu&s;ef, the reigning dey, de&s;irous of being exempted from the command of the expe|dition, pretended indi&s;po&s;ition. But the &s;oldiers were not di&s;po&s;ed to receive his excu&s;e, and com|pelled him to embark in one of his galleys; and le&s;t he &s;hould de&s;ert them, he was e&s;corted by an|other
<PB N="288" REF="032877_0146_0FF5A990222DC950">
other galley, and was obliged to &s;ubmit to being di&s;embarked with his army at the place appointed.</P>
<P>At this time there were, according to &s;ome ac|counts, about three thou&s;and French renega|dos in Algiers. Before this time the renegados were prohibited from &s;erving in the capacity of Tur|ki&s;h &s;oldiers; but Mahomet Ba&s;haw fir&s;t allow|ed them to be incorporated with the Turks in 1568.</P>
<P>The pay of each &s;oldier was eight More&s;co doubles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This double is about 25 cents in value.</NOTE> a month; but their pay was enhanced upon extraordinary emergencies, and in proportion to the number of years they had &s;erved. When|ever the Sultane&s;s was delivered of a &s;on, or they had any remarkable engagement with the Arabs, or any &s;oldier had killed his enemy in an engage|ment and brought away his head, their pay was augmented a double a month: provided the num|ber of doubles did not exceed forty.</P>
<P>The unmarried &s;oldiers enjoyed greater privileges than tho&s;e who were married. To the former were di&s;tributed four loaves of bread a day, but to the latter none.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers kept no guard in the city; but a watch called <HI>Me&s;uart,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-five per&s;ons, paraded the &s;treets. In the &s;ummer the city was nearly de&s;titute of a garri&s;on, as the army was then di&s;per&s;ed into various parts of the country to enforce the payment of taxes.</P>
<P>The divan were convened twice a week in a gal|lery of the palace, and con&s;i&s;ted of 40 per&s;ons. All matters were decided here by a majority; but what was remarkable, the votes were collected be|fore

the debate was clo&s;ed. All cau&s;es between the &s;oldiers were decided in this council, but tho&s;e be|tween the citizens were determined before the chiah, who was the dey's lieutenant.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A compendium of the adventures of Emanuel D'Aranda, containing an account of the treatment of the Algerine &s;laves in the time of Pinchinin.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EMANUEL D'ARANDA was a native of Dunkirk i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Flanders, and was a &s;lave in Al|giers for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of two years. On the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t 1640, he left Madrid, and proceeded by land to St. Seba&s;tian, where he embarked on board an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, in order to return to his own coun|try, after having vi&s;ited various parts of Spain. After being at &s;ea a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> days, they di&s;covered a large &s;hip bearing down upon them, which proved to be a ca|ravel. The ma&s;ter of the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el immedi|ately ordered his &s;ails to be furled up, and alledged for a rea&s;on that it was not cu&s;tomary for an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el to run away at &s;ea. The caravel &s;oon came within gun &s;hot, but without hoi&s;ting her colours; whereupon it was concluded that &s;he was a pirate.</P>
<P>But night coming on both ve&s;&s;els lay to, waiting the events that were to take place the next morning. The pa&s;&s;engers of the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el u&s;ed every ar|gument in their power to induce the captain to make his e&s;cape; but he was inflexibly determined to maintain his &s;tation. About ten o'clock next morn|ing two Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els hove in &s;ight, and were &s;oon within gun &s;hot. In this &s;ituation re&s;i&s;tance was vain. One of the Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els hailed her, and ordered her to &s;trike her colours; upon which a boat's crew was &s;ent out, who immediately took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="291" REF="032877_0147_0FF5AA6DA7CE8D40">
of the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, and her crew were &s;ent on board of one of the Turki&s;h &s;hips, which im|mediately after &s;tood for Algiers.</P>
<P>On the eleventh day after their capture, they pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treights of Gibralter, where the Turks, as they pa&s;&s;ed, ob&s;erved many &s;uper&s;titious ceremo|nies. Among a variety the following was ob&s;erved; they ca&s;t a ve&s;&s;el of oil into the &s;ea, which they imagined &s;wam to a mountain called <HI>La montagne des Signes,</HI> where a great &s;anton or &s;aint re&s;ided, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon the oil, and in con&s;equence of this gift di&s;pen&s;ed various ble&s;&s;ings to them. During the pa&s;|&s;age of the oil, lighted candles were placed upon the great guns (a ceremony that was particularly ob|&s;erved by ve&s;&s;els that pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treights in the night) which burnt for the purpo&s;e of affording light to the oil in its pa&s;&s;age. All the&s;e ceremonies were performed with prayers and great devotion.</P>
<P>The third day after pa&s;&s;ing the &s;treights, they an|chored oppo&s;ite the city of Algiers; the guns of the ve&s;&s;el were fired, and their report brought a large concour&s;e of people to the &s;hore. D'Aranda with the re&s;t of the crew were now freed from their chains, and taken to the market where the Chri&s;tian &s;laves were &s;old, in order to &s;ee if any of them were known; from thence they were conducted to the palace of the dey, (who was entitled to every eighth pri&s;oner) that he might make his choice out of the number of captives.</P>
<P>He was &s;eated in his hall of audience, and &s;at cro&s;s-l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gged on an elegant &s;eat, covered with blue tape&s;try, holding in his hand a number of plumes, re&s;embling a fan. His dre&s;s was a long gown of red &s;ilk, and a turban neatly interwoven.</P>
<P>After the dey had made choice of his &s;hare of the captives, the remainder were taken to the hou&s;e of
<PB N="292" REF="032877_0148_0FF5A99EC0895C10">
one of the Turks who&s;e ve&s;&s;el had taken the prize. As D'Aranda was going into the hou&s;e, the Turk a&s;ked him in Italian, if he was hungry, he an&s;wered in the affirmative; whereupon a Chri&s;tian &s;lave brought the pri&s;oners &s;ome bread and a ba&s;ket of grapes, with which they regaled them&s;elves. The hou&s;e was built in the Italian manner; the galleries were formed of white marble, and the pavement, the pillars and the arches were well proportioned, according to the laws of architecture. They were confined in this hou&s;e, where they were obliged to &s;leep on the floor in the galleries, and were not per|mitted to leave the hou&s;e till they were &s;old.</P>
<P>After they had been confined here &s;even days, they were vi&s;ited by Pinchinin and &s;ome of the riche&s;t Turks, who came with an intention to purcha&s;e &s;laves. They a&s;ked the pri&s;oners whether they were able to pay the price of their ran&s;om; but they an&s;wered in the negative, and in con&s;e|quence no purcha&s;e was made. They were after|wards brought to the market, where an old man, with a &s;taff in his hand, took D'Aranda by the arm, and led him &s;everal times round the market-place. A number of per&s;ons, de&s;irous of purcha&s;|ing, appeared, who a&s;ked D'Aranda his profe&s;&s;ion and the place of his nativity. They took him by the hand to examine if it was hard; and ordered him to open his mouth, to &s;ee whether his teeth were &s;ufficiently good for chewing hard bi&s;kets on board the galleys. They were then all ordered to be &s;eated in a row. The old man took the fir&s;t in order and led him three or four times round the market, crying <HI>arrache, arrache,</HI> who offers mo&s;t? After the &s;ale he was placed upon the other &s;ide of the market, and in the &s;ame manner all the others were &s;old. D'Aranda was purcha&s;ed by a rene|gado
<PB N="293" REF="032877_0148_0FF5A99EC0895C10">
named Saban Gallan, who gave 200 pata|coons for him.</P>
<P>The dey being entitled to any &s;lave at the price offered for him in the market, they were in con&s;e|quence once more taken to the palace: each one having in his hat a piece of paper, on which was written the price at which he was &s;old. The dey thought proper to purcha&s;e D'Aranda, and Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en and Saldens two of his companions; telling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">em that he had heard they were per&s;ons of quality, and that he expected a large &s;um for their ran|&s;om. He then ordered them to the &s;tables of the palace, where they found 250 other &s;laves in|tended as a &s;upply to the galleys. In the&s;e &s;ta|bles they were confined one and twenty days, and their daily allowance here was two &s;mall loaves of bread a-piece.</P>
<P>Towards the end of September, when their gal|leys make their la&s;t crui&s;e, the&s;e &s;laves began to prepare for &s;ea. To each one was di&s;tributed, by the dey's order, &s;ome coar&s;e cloth, for the purpo&s;e of making them &s;uch clothes as were worn in the gal|leys. On the day appointed for the &s;laves to go on board, a number of barbers attended the &s;ta|bles, and &s;haved the heads and beards of tho&s;e who were intended as rowers. After they were &s;haved, the dey's &s;teward, and the captain of one of the galleys entered the &s;tables, and ordered the &s;laves into an adjoining court, where each one had his office and &s;tation a&s;&s;igned him. After this there remained twenty &s;laves more than &s;ufficient to man the galleys. D'Aranda was among this number, and the captain of the galley &s;aid to the &s;teward as he pa&s;&s;ed them, <HI>We will leave the&s;e ra&s;cals on &s;hore, for they are &s;avages yet.</HI></P>
<P>They were then ordered back to the dey's &s;ta|bles,
<PB N="294" REF="032877_0149_0FF5A9A04BBC93E0">
and the &s;ame day four galleys thus manned, left the harbour. The dey finding D'Aranda and his companions neither rich nor per&s;ons of quality, ordered them to be brought into his pre&s;ence in the hall of audience, where they found Pinchinin, who &s;aid to them, <HI>Chri&s;tians I have bought you of the dey, but at a very great price.</HI> He then &s;ent them to his hou&s;e, where they found twenty female &s;laves who attended his wife, be&s;ides twelve male &s;laves, and a &s;eraglio of forty young boys between nine and fifteen years of age.</P>
<P>From Pinchinin's hou&s;e they were &s;ent to his bagnio, the place appointed for &s;uch of his &s;laves as were intended for the galleys. This bangio was a &s;treet or large entry i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his hou&s;e, where pirates and Turki&s;h &s;oldiers re&s;orted, who &s;pent their time in drinking, and the commi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t unna|tural crimes. D'Aranda not being acquainted with any one in this &s;eminary of <HI>virtue,</HI> was obliged to &s;leep the fir&s;t night upon the terrace of the bagnio, and the next morning when he ro&s;e he &s;aw an Ita|lian &s;lave bringing in a great variety of articles and hou&s;ehold &s;tuff, and crying <HI>arrache, arrache.</HI> D'Aranda enquired of a certain knight of Malta with whom he had become acquainted, what the Italian meant. "As our ma&s;ter Pinchinin," replied the knight, <Q>allows his &s;laves nothing for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the greate&s;t part of them live upon &s;tealing, and the booty of the preceding day is every morning thus &s;old for their &s;upport.</Q></P>
<P>The next morning before &s;un-ri&s;e the guardian coming into the bagnio, &s;aluted D'Aranda and his companions with <HI>Sur&s;a cani, aba&s;o canal|la,</HI> get up you dogs, come down you &s;coundrels. After this coar&s;e &s;alutation, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ducted them to Babloet, in the &s;uburbs of the city, where they
<PB N="295" REF="032877_0149_0FF5A9A04BBC93E0">
were employed in a large rope-walk. D'Aranda and Saldens were appointed to turn a large wheel. Upon their turning the wheel too &s;wiftly, their guar|dian cried out to them in Lingua Franca, <HI>forti, forti,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>gently;</HI> but they mi&s;under&s;tanding the term, turned the wheel with all their might, which &s;o exa&s;perated their guardian, that he ran up to them in a rage, and with a huge cudgel taught them the &s;ignification of <HI>forti.</HI></P>
<P>After they were thus initiated into the knowledge or rope making, they were compelled to pound wheat in a mortar; a much more laborious employment, in which D'Aranda acquitted him&s;elf but very in|differently; upon which his guardian &s;aid to him, <HI>give over that work you dog, you are too &s;avage yet.</HI> In putting the wheat into bags after it had been pounded, a little happened to be &s;pilt on the ground; whereupon their guardian &s;aid, <HI>Pilla e&s;&s;e cani,</HI> take that up you dog: but D'Aranda not under&s;tanding him, his keeper gave him a mo&s;t unmerciful blow over the back with a billet of wood, which gave him a dangerous wound, from which a copious &s;tream of blood i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>A very heavy bag of wheat was then placed upon each one's &s;houlder, which they had to car|ry a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and D'Aranda's &s;trength failing him after he had gone a few paces, the bag began to &s;lide down his back; upon which his keeper &s;truck him in the face &s;everal times with his fi&s;t, and the blood &s;treamed plentifully from his mouth and no&s;e; which compelled him to greater exertions, and he &s;taggered under the load till he arrived at Pinchinin's hou&s;e, where he fell down, perfectly exhau&s;ted with the burden. But the mo&s;t arduous part of their labour was yet to be perform|ed. They were under the nece&s;&s;ity of carrying
<PB N="296" REF="032877_0150_0FF5A9A1D2EE86F0">
the&s;e bags up into a granary forty feet high; ae ta&s;k which D'Aranda would have found totally impracticable, had not his companion Saldens, who was much &s;tronger, compa&s;&s;ionately carried it up for him, while he lay upon the ground be&s;meared with &s;weat, du&s;t and blood, and &s;till unmercifully pounded by his keeper, who threatened to murder him. In this lamentable condition he returned to the bagnio.</P>
<P>In the mean time Caloen, his other companion, had been employed in leading a mule, laden with bi&s;ket, from Pinchinin's hou&s;e to the water &s;ide. In con&s;equence of the narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets, it was a cu&s;tom in Algiers, when one led a loaded mule or camel, to cry <HI>Belec,</HI> take care there. But our new mule-driver, ignorant of the cu&s;tom, gave no warning of his approach, and in pa&s;&s;ing, threw a Turk into the mud. The Turk getting up in a great rage, drew his knife, (which they carried about them in&s;tead of a &s;word) and would have murdered Caloen, had he not been prevented by &s;ome other Turks, who hallowed out to him, <HI>don't you &s;ee that Chri&s;tian is a &s;avage yet, and don't under&s;tand the cu&s;tom;</HI> the word SAVAGE being a term of reproach which was given him becau&s;e he was dre&s;&s;ed in a Chri&s;tian habit.</P>
<P>While they were in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t extreme indigence, expecting nothing from Pinchinin, and not ver&s;ed in the art of &s;tealing, the common profe&s;|&s;ion in the bagnio, they had the good fortune to bor|row &s;eventy-five patacoons from an Italian merchant in Algiers, to whom they became jointly bound for the payment of a hundred at Antwerp.</P>
<P>Their next employment was in a vine-yard be|longing to one of Pinchinin's country-hou&s;es, where very laborious ta&s;ks were a&s;&s;igned them; for which
<PB N="297" REF="032877_0150_0FF5A9A1D2EE86F0">
D'Aranda, being but indifferently qualified, agreed with his guardian to allow him four rials a month if he would give him a more ea&s;y employment: and in con&s;equence his next bu&s;ine&s;s was to carry &s;ome large pots of water to the lodgings of the chief guar|dian. D'Aranda now fared pretty well, and was much plea&s;ed with his new employment; but a trivial occurrence &s;hortly after excluded him from this bu&s;ine&s;s; for as he was pouring a pot of wa|ter one day into the <HI>Tin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ga,</HI> or great ci&s;tern, he acco&s;ted a Turki&s;h woman who entered the hou&s;e, and a&s;ked her if &s;he would drink a gla&s;s of &s;ack. This que&s;tion being overheard, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his employment, and compelled the next day to work with &s;ome other &s;laves in attending ma|&s;ons.</P>
<P>This happened in the month of December, when the cor&s;airs crui&s;ed along the coa&s;t of Anda|lu&s;ia, in order to capture Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els laden with wine and fruits. The&s;e cor&s;airs had taken a frigate of Dunkirk, in which there was a young man who was &s;old to Pinchinin, with whom D'Aranda had been formerly acquainted. This young man &s;hortly after had an interview with D'Aranda, and being moved at the recital of his misfortunes, gave him &s;ome jewels, which he pawned for ten crowns. This was a very &s;ea&s;onable &s;up|ply, as his &s;eventy-five patacoons were by this time &s;pent, and his credit was in con&s;equence very much rai&s;ed at the bagnio, which was more than u&s;ually crouded at this time by great numbers of Turks and Chri&s;tian &s;laves who came to drink &s;ack, a cargo of which had been lately taken in one their prizes. About thirty &s;laves were taken in this frigate who were employed in unloading her. Some of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e had the good fortune to be afterwards
<PB N="298" REF="032877_0151_0FF5AA95587D1E88">
employed as tavern keepers, a bu&s;ine&s;s which was prohibited to Turks; others of the crew were con|&s;igned to the galleys, where they were chained to the outermo&s;t oar, men whom the Algerines called <HI>Bo|gavands.</HI> The&s;e &s;laves con&s;i&s;ted of Spanards, Italians and Ru&s;&s;ians, and being a little intoxicated one night a quarrel en&s;ued between &s;ome of them, which made a great uproar in the bagnio. Whereupon a prie&s;t came into the room with a wax candle in his hand, and quelled the di&s;turbance. The news of this riot &s;oon came to the ears of the patron of the bagnio, who came attended by &s;everal per|&s;ons with cre&s;&s;et lights and lanthrons, and armed with cudgels. They all fled at the approach of the patron; but one of the rioters was &s;eized, &s;tripped naked, and held by the hands and feet by four &s;laves with his belly on the floor, where he received a hundred blows on the back with a cudgel.</P>
<P>D'Aranda had now re&s;ided &s;ix months in Al|giers, at which time he and his companions went to Pinchinin, and ki&s;&s;ing his robe and the &s;leeve of his inner garment, the Turki&s;h mode of paying homage, they told him they had come to agree with him about the price of their ran&s;om. After &s;ome conver&s;ation Pinchinin told them he was then going out of town with &s;ome &s;laves to fell timber for a new frigate which was building, and that he would talk further with them upon the &s;ubject at his return.</P>
<P>In the mean time D'Aranda was employed at a new hou&s;e belonging to Pinchinin in the upper part of the city, where he was obiged to carry materials on his back up a &s;teep hill where mules and camels could not be u&s;ed. While he was at work two Turks came to the bagnio and enquir|ed for D'Aranda, Caloen, and Saldens; but as
<PB N="299" REF="032877_0151_0FF5AA95587D1E88">
they had changed their names, nobody could give any account of them. The Turks then ap|plied to a Brabant &s;lave called <HI>Francis the &s;tudent,</HI> to examine &s;ome papers which were written in La|tin, giving &s;ome account of the &s;laves. Francis, upon examination, concluded that D'Aranda and his companions were the per&s;ons they were enquir|ing for, and told them he knew the &s;laves very well. Whereupon he went with them to the bagnio, where they found D'Aranda and his companions, whom they informed they were no longer &s;laves; at which the were greatly overjoyed.</P>
<P>The next day a Jew came to the bagnio, and by order of Pinchinin's wife, told D'Aranda and his companions that the dey wi&s;hed to &s;peak to them. When they were brought before him, he comman|ded them to go into a &s;mall drawing room of the palace, where they continued about three hours with &s;ome young Chri&s;tian &s;laves. At length the &s;teward made his appearance with a cudgel, and &s;aid to them, <HI>You dogs which of you wrote home to be exchanged for Turks?</HI> They all excu&s;ed them|&s;elves; but the &s;teward not much di&s;po&s;ed to re|ceive their excu&s;es, gave them all a &s;evere beating, and told them he would come again at night and cut off their ears and no&s;es. They were here con|fined in this &s;mall apartment in extreme mi&s;ery for eighteen days; during which time they were fre|quently vi&s;ited by the &s;teward, who always carried his cudgel in his hand, and &s;ometimes beat them for his diver&s;ion. The Turks now waited upon Pinchinin, who had returned, and told him they had engaged to procure an exchange of D'Aranda and his com|panions for &s;even of their Turki&s;h friends, who were pri&s;oners in Flanders, and offered him by way of ran&s;om the &s;ame &s;um he had given for them. But
<PB N="300" REF="032877_0152_0FF5AA93D2A96B88">
Pinchinin told them the&s;e &s;laves were per&s;ons of quality, for each of whom he demanded 6000 pata|coons as the price of ran&s;om.</P>
<P>While the Turks were endeavouring to effect an exchange of pri&s;oners nine weeks pa&s;&s;ed away, du|ring which time D'Aranda and his companions were confined in the dey's palace. After much delay the Turks agreed with Pinchinin upon the price of their ran&s;om; upon which they were relea&s;ed from confinement, and lodged in the hou&s;e of <HI>Cataborn Mu&s;tapha,</HI> one of the Turks, who became their new patron. Caloen was &s;oon after &s;ent in a ve&s;&s;el bound to Leghorn, in order to procure the liberty of the Turki&s;h pri&s;oners in exchange, according to the agreement made between the&s;e Turks and the friends of D'Aranda and his companions, who de|tained the Turki&s;h pri&s;oners in Flanders.</P>
<P>D'Aranda &s;till continued with Mu&s;tapha, but his re&s;idence here was of &s;hort duration; for Mu&s;tapha getting drunk one day quarrelled with a <HI>Bulcebas,</HI> a captain of foot, whom he called a Chri&s;tian. For this offence Mu&s;tapha &s;uffered impri&s;onment, and by or|der of the divan received a hundred blows on the back with a cudgel; after which he was compel|led to &s;erve &s;ix months in the field again&s;t king Ben|nali.</P>
<P>After the departure of Mu&s;tapha, D'Aranda was received into the family of Mahomet Celibi Oiga, where he was employed in the capacity of a &s;ervant. Here he &s;oon became very intimate with his new mi&s;tre&s;s who granted him many liberties, and per|mitted him to attend public wor&s;hip every day at Pinchinin's bagnio.</P>
<P>In the mean time Caloen, who was not &s;o fortu|nate, was impri&s;oned in the hou&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> grandmother, where he was confined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">
<PB N="301" REF="032877_0152_0FF5AA93D2A96B88">
apartment with nearly 80 weight of iron about his legs, and frequently &s;ent into the country, where his keepers were in&s;tructed to torture him with the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive hunger in order to expedite the pay|ment of his ran&s;om.</P>
<P>At the expiration of &s;ix months after D'Aranda had re&s;ided at Oiga's hou&s;e, he received a letter from Saldens, dated at Ceuta, who reque&s;ted his im|mediate attendance at Tetuan in the kingdom of Fez, according to contract with the two Turks. This letter contained information that Caloen's fa|ther had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to pay the 700 patacoons that were demanded for his ran&s;om, but made no particular mention of the five Turks who were to be given in exchange for D'Aranda and his compa|nions.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this information Mu&s;tapha's grandmother immediately ordered Caloen to be confined with a hundred weight of iron about his legs, in a &s;mall cellar, where D'Aranda frequently vi&s;ited him; and one day while he was with him, the old woman entered the cellar, and a&s;ked Caloen if he was willing yet to pay the 700 patacoons. He made no an&s;wer, but laughed at her; which &s;o great|ly enraged the old lady, that &s;he ordered D'Aran|da to be &s;eized and loaded with irons in the &s;ame cell, becau&s;e &s;he had imputed Caloen's conduct entirely to his advice. Here they remained till the time fixed for the departure of a ve&s;&s;el de&s;tined for Tetuan, when, by the interce&s;&s;ion of three Chri&s;tian &s;laves who intended to embark in this ve&s;&s;el, they were relea&s;ed upon a promi&s;e that her grand&s;on Mu&s;tapha, who was at Ceuta, &s;hould be liberated in exchange.</P>
<P>About this time (which was the fir&s;t of January 164<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) terminated the fa&s;t of Ramadan, which con|tinued
<PB N="302" REF="032877_0153_0FF5AAA2022CCB10">
for a month, during which time they were prohibited from eating or drinking in the day; and tho&s;e who were detected in violating this law were compelled to &s;wallow melted lead. About the time of &s;un-&s;et the people were permitted to eat, and drums were beaten as a &s;ignal to cea&s;e from fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>To this fa&s;t &s;ucceeded the fe&s;tival or Ea&s;ter of Ramadan, which continued for eight days, and was celebrated with great pomp and fe&s;tivity. Caval|cades were formed without the city, and feats of hor&s;eman&s;hip were di&s;played. The Turki&s;h chil|dren were drawn in &s;mall triumphal chariots, to which Chri&s;tian &s;laves were harna&s;&s;ed. The prin|cipal amu&s;ement was wre&s;tling, at which the Moors were very expert. The prohibitions of the Alco|ran &s;eemed very little regarded at this time, and wine and brandy were drank in the greate&s;t exce&s;s. In the time of this fe&s;tival gifts were di&s;tributed to the &s;laves, and for the three or four fir&s;t days they were exempted from every kind of labour.</P>
<P>On the 14th of January D'Aranda and Caloen, after &s;ettling all preliminaries, embarked with a number of Turks and Chri&s;tian &s;laves on board the ve&s;&s;el bound for Tetuan. On the eighth day after they arrived at Oran, which is about forty leagues from Algiers, and on the twelfth at Treme&s;en, where they lay at anchor three days, and di&s;char|ged part of their Moori&s;h crew.</P>
<P>Treme&s;en was formerly a powerful kingdom, to which the dey of Algiers was tributory. It is &s;i|tuated at the extremity of the Grand Signior's do|minions, and is bounded by the empire of Morocco and Fez, with which the Grand Signior is in alli|ance; but notwith&s;tanding this empire is often at war with the Algerines, and this happens without any
<PB N="303" REF="032877_0153_0FF5AAA2022CCB10">
violation to the confederacy. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e with Tunis, which is included in the Grand Signior's dominions; but he does not concern him|&s;elf with the affairs of the ba&s;haws, and they are not con&s;idered at war till &s;ome place of importance is taken.</P>
<P>From Treme&s;en they &s;et &s;ail upon their voyage, and &s;hortly after, in con&s;equence of the di&s;charge of a number of Moors, a con&s;piracy was formed among the Chri&s;tian &s;laves to murder all the Turks on board, and to render them&s;elves ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el. But the whole de&s;ign mi&s;carried in con&s;equence of the ti|midity of a Spaniard, who was the principal in the con&s;piracy, and neglected to give the &s;ignal of on|&s;et, as had been previou&s;ly concerted.</P>
<P>On the twelfth of February in the evening they ca&s;t anchor in a bay within half a league of Te|tuan, and the next day a violent ea&s;t-wind aro&s;e which &s;ubjected them to imminent danger. The Turks terrified at the &s;torm began to &s;ay their <HI>&s;ala</HI> or prayers, and promi&s;ed to di&s;tribute alms as &s;oon as they were on &s;hore. But the tempe&s;t &s;till in|crea&s;ed in violence, and the ve&s;&s;el was every mo|ment in danger of being driven upon the rocks. In this extremity the Turks re&s;olved to offer a &s;acri|fice to Mahomet as their la&s;t re&s;ource; a number of &s;heep being always taken on board the Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els for this purpo&s;e. They cut one of the&s;e &s;heep into four parts, and with a variety of ridicu|lous ceremonies they ca&s;t the parts into the &s;ea on different quarters of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The tempe&s;t continued to increa&s;e till midnight, at which time the ve&s;&s;el began to drag her anchors. The Turks all a&s;&s;embled at the &s;tern in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ma|homet with the loude&s;t lamentations. The ve&s;&s;el
<PB N="304" REF="032877_0154_0FF5AA96E4738718">
continued to drag her anchors, and &s;oon after &s;he was wrecked upon the &s;hore, but the principal part of the crew were &s;aved.</P>
<P>D'Aranda and Caloen were greatly overjoyed at their deliverance, and the next morning they &s;et out for Tetuan, where they arrived about noon. While they continued here they received a letter from Don Martin de Pegnalo&s;o a Spani&s;h merchant at Ceuta, who informed them that Saldens had gone to Gibraltar, and had left orders with him to furni&s;h them with every thing nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Turki&s;h pri&s;oners who had been detained at Flanders had arrived at Ceuta. Mu&s;|tapha Ingles one of the pri&s;oners, imagining that Saldens had returned to Flanders, wrote to Tetuan to the Turk who had charge of D'Aranda and Ca|loen, that Saldens had promi&s;ed when he was in Flanders to pay 700 patacoons towards the ran&s;om which his relations had paid for Caloen, and that he &s;hould put them in the <HI>Ma&s;mora.</HI> The per&s;on who concerted this bu&s;ine&s;s was Abraham Arrais one of the Turki&s;h pri&s;oners, who reported at Ceu|ta that D'Aranda and Caloen had promi&s;ed 700 patacoons before their departure from Algiers.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this letter they were put into the Ma&s;mora, which was a large vault about thir|ty feet under ground, where 170 Chri&s;tian &s;laves were confined. While they were in this &s;ituation D'Aranda wrote to Saldens, who returned to Ceu|ta, and by his interce&s;&s;ion they were liberated from confinement, and &s;oon after took their de|parture for their native country.</P>
