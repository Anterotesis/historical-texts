<HEAD>THE JOURNAL OF WILLIAM SCUDDER.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born at We&s;tfield, in New-Jer&s;ey, and for a number of years in my youth could never &s;ay that I enjoyed a &s;tate of health; however, my days glided on until at the age of twenty-two years, when I was united in the bands of matrimony to a per&s;on who was not my choice. Here it may not be improper to caution all parents again&s;t too much rigidne&s;s in the choice of their children's marrying. In ca&s;e of any accident, per&s;ua&s;ions and good argu|ments ought ju&s;tly to be exerci&s;ed; but to lay a po&s;itive command, and put it in force, brings an endle&s;s and living &s;orrow upon the married pair; at the &s;ame time I would particularly recommend it to all young people, to live a virtuous and religious life, as the rever&s;e brings on &s;orrows and reflections not ea&s;ily era&s;ed&mdash;The &s;pring of life being gone, which thought is very oppre&s;&s;ive to a feeling mind, at lea&s;t when not &s;pent to that purpo&s;e for which the Great Author of our exi&s;tence de&s;igned it. It is certain, that in the time of youth, the greate&s;t comforts are to be enjoyed; for in general, health is &s;hooting forth her blooms, which renders the pro&s;|pect before us plea&s;ing and entertaining; there is &s;o great a field for improvement in the time of youth,

<P>After my marriage, my two brothers being &s;et|tled &s;ome di&s;tance from home, my father thought proper to continue me in his hou&s;e, and being of a fretful di&s;po&s;ition, and growing old and his faculties failing, added to my afflictions: for let me do right or wrong, I was almo&s;t &s;ure of meeting with blame, although he was a tender hearted man, and the poor often experienced his benevolence. I would ever advi&s;e a new married pair, not to live under the &s;ame roof with their parents, (e&s;pecially farmers) as it frequently creates a di&s;cord, they having two &s;e|parate intere&s;ts, generally &s;peaking. Thus I con|tinued until the tenth day of November, 1775, when I engaged in the fir&s;t Jer&s;ey regiment, under Captain Andrew M'Myers, what was called a fir&s;t &s;erjeant, and I thought it a great office; however, a number of my acquaintances &s;u&s;pected I would not continue in the &s;ervice; but being a whig, and all for liberty, I left home, which was by no means irreputable, as my father had a hand&s;ome e&s;tate, and plenty of a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>After recruiting &s;ome young men of good charac|ters,
<PB N="7" REF="027681_0005_0FD5DA1B0137C480">
we were quartered in the barracks in Eliza|beth-Town. We went that winter to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">emp&s;tead Plains, on Long I&s;land, to di&s;arm &s;ome inhabitants who it was reported were unfriendly to the common cau&s;e, under the command of General Heard, who brought the Middle&s;ex militia with him, and our regiment, which was under Lord Stirling, made up about twelve hundred men, with which we boldly marched on; our martial appearance &s;o &s;truck the poor inhabitants, that they came running in with their old ru&s;ty firelocks and &s;words, &s;ome ap|peared not to have been fired off &s;ince the days of Oliver Cromwell. In a few days we made a con|que&s;t, and returned back gallant and victorious, not having a man killed or wounded, only a brother &s;erjeant of mine fainted away, on the Plains, from a report that &s;ome regulars, were in Hemp&s;tead, en|trenching them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In February our regiment was ordered to New-York, and began to fortify the town. In the &s;ame month I met with an old friend of mine, who had formerly been well acquainted at my father's hou&s;e&punc; and had ju&s;t received a captain's commi&s;&s;ion from the New-York provincial congre&s;s; he &s;oli|cited me to accept a commi&s;&s;ion and go with him, which I had no objection to, as I had often to &s;tand cap in hand to &s;ome officers whom I did not think my equals before they received their commi&s;&s;ions and became men of con&s;equence; I therefore im|mediately made application to Lord Stirling, who interceded with General Lee, then commander in chief, and on producing a warrant from the New-York Congre&s;s, obtained a di&s;charge. I then pur|cha&s;ed a &s;word and became an officer. I went on recruiting rapidly, &s;o that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">jeant and corporal, I got &s;ixty-one &s;tout, able
<PB N="8" REF="027681_0006_0FD5DA612C272960">
bodied men, all quartered in We&s;tfield, on the in|habitants, at one dollar each man per week; &s;o that I judge, in the whole monies expended, I lo&s;t one hundred pounds, part of which I had to pay in hard money, after the clo&s;e of the war. In April we were ordered to New-York, and from thence to Stillwater, where we lay about &s;ix weeks, and then went to Ticonderoga. In June I had the command of &s;ome batteaux (by order of Colonel Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">eli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e Wynkoop, of the 4th New-York regiment, to which we belonged) that were loaded with provi|&s;ions to go to Crown Point, where our army then lay, under the command of General Sullivan, hav|ing t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">treated from Canada,&mdash;an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch a &s;cene of mortality as was exhibited at that place, I never had beheld. The ho&s;pital I judged to be about one hundred and fifty feet in length; on the lower floor in two ranges on each &s;ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the poor &s;ick and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers. Their di&s;order was chiefly the &s;mall-pox&mdash;Some groaning and begging for water, &s;ome dying, and others dead and &s;ewed up in their blankets; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that by the middle of the afternoon they would begin to carry the dead from the ho&s;pital: I counted twenty-one carried out at one time, and it was common to bury fifteen or twenty in a day. At Fort George the &s;ame di&s;|order prevailed, with other epidemical di&s;ea&s;es, which were as fatal as at Crown Point. My me|mory will not permit me to a&s;&s;ert, but as near as I can recollect, it was judged that near &s;ix thou&s;and per&s;ons died in that campaign, which was in the year 1776. In New-Jer&s;ey that year, the mortality was great, although General Wa&s;hington's army was more healthy.</P>
<P>What a &s;urpri&s;ing event the independency of A|merica ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> produced! A country then unarmed, un|di&s;ciplined,

epidemical di&s;orders prevailing, and in the fall of 1776 the army almo&s;t di&s;banded, our for|tifications take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and at lea&s;t twenty thou&s;and fine Briti&s;h troops, well di&s;ciplined and found, to with|&s;tand. Surely no man but an Athei&s;t, can deny the interpo&s;ition of Providence in our behalf.</P>
<P>In July or Augu&s;t General Gates took the com|mand at Ticonderoga, and the mount on the oppo|&s;ite &s;ide of the lake was fortified. In the fall of the year our regiment, with a company of nine-months men, commanded by Capt. Collins, were ordered to Skeen&s;borough, where we lay until the beginning of the winter, when we were di&s;banded, and every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">an went where he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame fall, a battle was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought on-Lake Cham|plain, by the two fleets, but the Briti&s;h gaining the victory, it put an end (on our par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) to any further armament by water in that quarter. General Ar|nold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought with his own ve&s;&s;el well, but it was &s;up|po&s;ed that experience in that way of righting was want|ing. General Waterbury was taken, with a number of pri&s;oners, who were all &s;ent to their own homes on parole, by Sir Guy Carlton. I will ju&s;t make this ob&s;ervation&mdash;that I am of opinion&punc; had Sir Guy Carlton came out Commander in Chief, at the com|mencement of the war, America would never have obtained her independence; for as &s;oon as any pri|&s;oners were taken, he would, if not at too great a di&s;tance from him, wait on them him&s;elf and treat them with much philanthropy, and tell them they were a deluded &s;et of people, and to return home and &s;tay quietly on their farms; but at the &s;ame time, if they were again taken under arms without being properly exchanged, the law o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> nations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould be put in force again&s;t them: in fact, his treatment was &s;o mild, that I very much doubt whether we
<PB N="10" REF="027681_0008_0FD5DA3E2DD91750">
&s;hould have been able to have kept an army up, as every &s;oldier would have been &s;ure of returning home after being taken. However the&s;e are my own &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The &s;ame fall, an appointment of officers took place in the York line, and I received a lieutenant's commi&s;&s;ion, under Col. G. Van Schaick, who order|ed me on the recruiting &s;ervice, at which, being a &s;tranger in the &s;tate of New-York, I thought to &s;tand a better chance in Jer&s;ey, where I was ac|quainted, but found it impracticable to li&s;t any men in that quarter of the world, as General Howe, lay in Brun&s;wick, and General Wa&s;hington, in Morris-Town. During my &s;tay in Jer&s;ey that winter, a great many &s;kirmi&s;hes happened between the Briti&s;h and Americans, chiefly foraging parties. I was at a place called Hanover, where &s;ome of the Jer&s;ey mi|litia lay, and an expre&s;s arrived with intelligence that a party of the enemy from New-York, were coming on to Morris-Town, which &s;pread a general alarm; however, it turned out to be about three hundred pri&s;oners, who were chiefly taken at Fort Wa&s;hing|ton, and had been confined in &s;ugar hou&s;es, cold jails, &amp;c. The poor objects pre&s;ented a &s;hocking view; for their appeared nothing in them but mo|numents of cruelty&mdash;emaciated with cold, hunger and poverty, being &s;o feeble as &s;carcely to be able to &s;upport their cold and benumbed limbs, and to be &s;hort, their hard&s;hips had been &s;o &s;evere, that the major part of them died after returning home, in &s;pight of every effort for their relief. What a dif|ference between the treatment of the pri&s;oners in New-York, and tho&s;e who were taken under Gene|ral Carlton's command: The one treated with be|nevolence, the other hurried into jails, dungeons and pri&s;on &s;hips, where hor&s;e-cart loads would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="11" REF="027681_0009_0FD5DA397A0D4460">
buried in one day: nay, it is a fact, that the friends o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the poor pri&s;oners in New-York, were prohibited from giving them any relief. I remained in Jer&s;ey until towards &s;pring, when I joined my regiment at Fort George, and lay there until Ticonderoga was evacuated.</P>
<P>Our army retreated by Skeen&s;borough to Fort Edward. We lay about fifteen days at Fort George after the evacuation, and then burnt four fine new brigs, which had been built for the defence of the lake, together with the barracks, and blew up the fort. We then marched to King&s;bury and encamp|ed near Fort Edward for a few days, having previ|ou&s;ly &s;ent all our &s;tores from Fort George to Fort Edward, even the cannon-balls, before we decamped.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day after we encamped at King&s;bury, a guard, about a mile from us, towards Fort Ann, was attacked by &s;ome Indians, who killed twelve of them. Our regiment was immediately ordered to march where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ring was, and to the honor of our Lieutenant-Colonel (Vandyke) and the regiment, they were &s;oon under a full march to the &s;pot, where every one, in my opinion, expected we &s;hould have an attack; but on our approach, the Indians fled. The men who were killed were all from New-England, fine, young, genteel per&s;ons. A few days after, we retreated towards Fort Miller; the army was then under the command of General Schuyler. I am at a lo&s;s exactly where we encamp|ed; but I judge about three miles from Fort Ed|ward. The next morning, it being my tour to go on duty, I was ordered with a party of men to go about half way from camp to Fort Edward. Some jocular conver&s;ation happened between my good friend Licut. Tobias Van Vactor and my&s;elf; he
<PB N="12" REF="027681_0010_0FD5DA1290FAF838">
remarked that I was going forward to be a terror to the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ds, &amp;c. After quitting camp about one mile, a heavy di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry was given ju&s;t ahead, on which we mended our pace, and to our &s;urpri&s;e, found &s;ix men and an officer expiring with their wounds, all being &s;calped. They were on their way to Fort Edward, where &s;ome of our troops then lay; and as they had gone without or|ders, and a report &s;pread in camp of the affair it was taken for granted that it was my party which was cut off, and that I was killed; it was mentioned at head quarters, by the Colonel of our regiment, that my&s;elf and party mu&s;t have fallen. After view|ing the melancholy &s;ight, we proceeded a little fur|ther, and according to orders, &s;ecreted our&s;elves in the woods until evening, when we returned to camp, to the no &s;mall joy of our brother officers and &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The next day, my friend Lieutenant Van Vactor, was on duty, and a party was to go to the heights beyond Fort Edward. The duty lay between him and another officer. Some propo&s;als were made to draw lots, but poor Tobias, &s;corning any thing which had the lea&s;t appearance of fear, chearfully &s;et out with his guard; and in the &s;ame jocular way, in return to him, I remarked&mdash;"Now Tobias, &s;urely the &s;avages will tremble at your approach"&mdash;But I little thought on what I was &s;aying; for the heights where he lay, about the middle of the afternoon, were attacked by the Indians, and being overpower|ed, was him&s;elf killed and all his guard, except one man. The Indians then proceeded within gun &s;hot of Fort Edward, and took the mother and daughter by the name of M'Crea (the young lady's chri&s;tian name was Jane) and carried them on the &s;pot where the above bloody &s;cene was tran&s;acted, and there
<PB N="13" REF="027681_0011_0FD5DA0F22A75E50">
murdered and &s;calped both mother and daughter. They &s;tripped poor Van Vactor, and after &s;calping him, &s;tabbed him in &s;everal places; they then fa&s;tened a tomahawk in his brea&s;t, &s;harpened a &s;tick and erect|ed him on his feet, by bracing the &s;harp part of the &s;tick under his chin, and left him a &s;tanding monu|ment of their barbarity.</P>
<P>Thus was my dear friend, who ventured his life in the cau&s;e of freedom and his country, treated! Good God! what a &s;cene pre&s;ented! to meet him thus mangled, together with Mi&s;s M'Crea, &s;ide and &s;ide in a hor&s;e-cart! Melancholy thought! The theme is too mournful to dwell on.&mdash;After this un|heard of cruelty, vengeance was &s;worn again&s;t the Indians, which I am of opinion was of advantage, as they never acted with that boldne&s;s afterwards. The death of Mi&s;s Jane M'Crea, &s;pread a general alarm, particularly through the New-England &s;tates, and I believe drove many to arms, who before &s;eem|ed to appear in &s;u&s;pence. Her death al&s;o made &s;ome di&s;turbance among&s;t the Briti&s;h; for it was reported &s;he was waiting at Fort Edward, for the Briti&s;h ar|my to come forward, as a Mr. Jones, was in &s;aid ar|my to whom &s;he was &s;hortly to be married. The next day I was a pall-bearer to a&s;&s;i&s;t in conveying my good friend to his la&s;t retreat, which could not be done with dry eyes; he was buried with the honors of war. Mi&s;s M'Crea was al&s;o buried in the &s;ame grave with him. The two harmle&s;s monitors lay &s;ilent as the night, not an intervening cloud to di&s;|turb their repo&s;e. Lie there haple&s;s pair, and as your re&s;t appears cordial together under the cold clods, may your better part be triumphing in that haven, where all &s;orrows are wiped away, and but one continued repo&s;e, will be your everla&s;ting bli&s;s.

<P>Mr. Van Vactor was born and brought up in Brun&s;wick, in New-Jer&s;ey, but had lived &s;ome time with General Schuyler, in a reputable office and character.</P>
<P>This &s;cene puts me further in mind of a piece of poetry I read on the tomb of two Penn&s;ylvania of|ficers, who were killed and &s;calped at Crown-Point, unarmed:</P>

<P>The officer who was killed going to Fort Edward without arms or orders, belonged to the New-En|gland line. The day we decamped from the ground where Van Vactor was buried, the Briti&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fort Edward. We marched to the heights oppo&s;ite Col. M'Crea's, and lay for a few days. The morning our regiment left that place, it was my tour to go on duty as far as our la&s;t en|camping

ground, and on my arrival, General Ar|nold, with a number of militia was on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the north river; the General ordered me to cro&s;s the river, which I did on a raft of boards, leav|ing an En&s;ign with the party, and was informed &s;ome Briti&s;h and Indians had a few minutes before parted from a hou&s;e within &s;mall gun-&s;hot of where we then were, on that &s;ide of the river. And, after receiving &s;ome orders from the General, returned with the party (con&s;i&s;ting of about thirty men) with precaution, as we had to march &s;ome di&s;tance thro' the woods, within about two miles of five hundred Indians, and a number of Burgoyne's army. On our arrival on the ground, the army had marched to Fort Miller; however, we overtook them, as the gra&s;s did not grow under our feet. The mili|tia aforementioned whom we left on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, appeared in high &s;pirits, and were carele&s;sly walking about, as the land was clear and they apparently out of danger. Some Indians ap|peared in about half an hour after our departure, the &s;ame &s;ide we were on; the militia fired and whooped at them through deri&s;ion, but about thirty of their mo&s;t expert warriors cro&s;&s;ed the river, un|perceived, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;tumps, &amp;c. got oppo&s;ite the militia before they di&s;covered them|&s;elves; they then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ired and gave the war whoop, which &s;o frightened the militia, that without firing a gun, every man took to his heels promi&s;cuou&s;ly for near two miles; the Indians followed in clo&s;e pur|&s;uit and killed a number of men; but being met by the brave Capt.

was wounded in the neck. The rea&s;on why I make u&s;e of the term volunteer, is&mdash;that it being impo&s;&s;ible to put the whole army, or even a large command, on &s;o &s;udden an emergency, in motion, with that expedition which appeared nece&s;&s;ary, a few therefore voluntarily a&s;&s;embled to make an im|mediate advance. My party at the &s;ame time had not reached the main body, although we had a fair view of part of the militia's retreat; but the river being impa&s;&s;able and our number &s;o &s;mall, that we &s;uppo&s;ed any attempt in vain, as we were unac|quainted with the number of the enemy. I do not think that General Arnold had any command of the militia, but him&s;elf and aid were on a reconnoitering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> through a clear country (or nearly &s;o) and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> returned before the attack.&mdash;This part of my memoirs, however, is written in the year. 1784, after a long captivity, with only the &s;trength of me|mory; if I err, whoever &s;hall read this journal hope will pardon me.</P>
<P>We afterwards by regular retreats, arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Fort Miller, Saratoga and Still-Water, without any interruption with all our ordnance, baggage, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in ju&s;tice to General Schuyler and the army general, mu&s;t &s;ay that they behaved with all t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> regularity and decorum which could have been ex|pected from a well regulated army under tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances.

bra&s;s pieces of artillery, were ordered for the relief of the garri&s;on, under the command of General Ar|nold. The artillery was commanded by Captain Dunbar, and Lieutenants Dri&s;kel, and Kemper. Accordingly, about the middle of the afternoon, we marched, and by a hard route on the third day ar|rived at the German Flats, oppo&s;ite what was called Shoemaker's, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">here we heard almo&s;t a con&s;tant fi|ring. A young man, I think by the name of Schuy|ler, who held a commi&s;&s;ion in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, had come to the Flats where he was acquainted, to per&s;uade the people from their allegiance to the &s;tates, particularly &s;o, after the &s;ad overthrow of &s;o large a number of the militia, who were inhabitants of that county, under General Herkimer; but it appeared the people &s;tood firm, although it might be &s;aid their place was invaded; they were certainly in great danger, but were &s;till &s;o determined as to make Schuyler a pri&s;oner; he was tried by a court-martial of the officers under Arnold's command, and condemned to be hanged as a &s;py; a gallows was accordingly erected for that purpo&s;e. Arnold how|ever, concluded to grant him a reprieve, on condition that he would leave an ho&s;tage behind to hang in his place, if he did not perform the bu&s;ine&s;s he was go|ing to &s;end him on, with punctuality, and return: otherwi&s;e, if an ho&s;tage was produced, and a non|compliance on Schuyler's part, the ho&s;tage &s;hould die in his &s;tead. A man appeared and entered into Schuyler's place, on which General Arnold gave Schuyler the following directions&mdash;"That he the &s;aid Schuyler, &s;hould go immediately to the com|mander of the Briti&s;h, lying before Fort Stanwix, and inform him, that he the &s;aid Arnold, had under his immediate command, thirteen hundred well di&s;|ciplined troops, with a good train of artillery, and

Schuyler was &s;ent to Albany and the army put under marching orders.&mdash;I am not certain that the above are the words of Arnold's orders to Schuyler, but are to the purport, as far as I could learn.</P>
<P>During the &s;iege at Fort Stanwix, General Her|kimer, as I before mentioned, met with an over|throw. Having embodied the major part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the be&s;t inhabitants of that county (amounting to about &s;even hundred men) into a brigade, in order to go to the relief of the &s;aid fort, they were met on their march by the Indians, who totally defeated them; four hundred men or more were killed in the action, &s;uppo&s;ed to be through mi&s;conduct, as part of the militia ran away in the fir&s;t on&s;et: tho&s;e who &s;tood were almo&s;t to a man cut off. The General received a wound in his leg, which was amputated; but it being warm weather, and he a corpulent man, died of the wound.</P>
<P>The battle happened about eight days before our arrival, and after we marched for the &s;ort. Hear|ing the &s;iege was razed, we left our artillery in order to make what force we could, expecting to come up with the rear of the enemy; we had to march over the ground where Herkimer's battle was fought, and as the dead had not been buried, and the wea|ther warm, they were much &s;woln and of a purple colour, which repre&s;ented the frailty of man in a ve|ry figurative &s;en&s;e; we mu&s;t have marched over and very near, about four hundred dead bodies; which

<P>We continued our march, without any mole&s;tation, until our arrival at the fort, where we congratulated the old be&s;ieged officers and &s;oldiers with joy for their being relieved. The next morning, about five hundred men were &s;ent down Wood Creek after the enemy, but they had gone off.</P>
<P>General Arnold and the New-England troops continued a few days at the garri&s;on and then march|ed down to join the main army, at Stillwater, leaving our regiment at the Fort, not knowing but the Brit|i&s;h might again return to the &s;iege.

<P>Our arrival at Fort Stanwix, I judge to be about the latter end of Augu&s;t or beginning of September, in the year 1777, at which place we continued until October; we were then ordered to march to Alba|ny, during which time we received no interruption from the enemy.

<P>General Wa&s;hington's army met with a con&s;ider|able lo&s;s that campaign, at the Brandywine; but hutted them&s;elves very &s;nugly the winter following, at a place called Valley Forge, whil&s;t General Howe lay in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>We marched from Schenectady to Albany, where the main body of General Gates's army in a few days arrived, having &s;ent Burgoyne's troops, who &s;urrendered on the 15th of October, to Bo&s;ton.&mdash;Our army lay about two or three weeks, and then marched from Albany to join General Wa&s;hington, except the regiment to which I belonged. The ar|my, from information, had a tedious, rainy, cold march, as it mu&s;t have been &s;ome time in Decem|ber before they arrived at their cantonments, and had then to hut them&s;elves; but a braver &s;et of troops perhaps never exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>Our regiment lay a few weeks after the army had marched to the &s;outhward, and then returned to Schenectady, where we were quartered all winter, although &s;ome troops continued in Albany.</P>

Su&s;&s;ex, Ea&s;t-Town, and &s;o to Valley Forge, where we arrived about the middle of the after|noon, but I am not certain as to the day of the month; we were ordered to proceed on to a place, near the Blue-Ball eighteen miles from Philadel|phia, and were quartered in hou&s;es, where we lived comfortably, among&s;t a &s;ociable &s;et of inhabitants, until July; when orders were received for us to join the main army, to proceed after the Briti&s;h who had evacuated Philadelphia, under the com|mand of Sir Henry Clinton. We pur&s;ued them un|til we came near Princeton; a draught was made to form a light infantry, to be commanded by Gene|ral Lee, and it being my tour of duty, it fell to my lot to go into the &s;aid infantry; and accordingly, having twenty-two men of my choice from our regiment, joined them. The next day we arri|ved at Engli&s;h-Town, near Monmouth Court-Hou&s;e, within little more than a mile of the out wing of the Briti&s;h army; our regiment was com|manded by Colonel Richard Butler, Lieutenant Colonel Harmer, and Major Benjamin Ledyard, who was a Major in the regiment to which I belonged; the other gentlemen were of the Penn&s;ylvania line. About break of day on the 28th, we were all under arms, and a little after &s;unri&s;e came oppo&s;ite to Mon|mouth Court-Hou&s;e on the left, having pa&s;&s;ed thro' woods where &s;ome of the Briti&s;h had that night en|camped. However, previou&s;ly to our proceeding &s;o far, General Lee joined us with the main body of in|fantry, and the whole being formed into &s;ections four deep, made a grand and exten&s;ive appearance; it was not ea&s;y to determine our number particularly: a foot officer cannot form a judgment with as much preci|&s;ion as an officer on hor&s;eback; but if I mi&s;take not, the calculation was at lea&s;t five thou&s;and men. On

our front appearing oppo&s;ite the enemy, who were marching on the main road; it apparently &s;truck them with con&s;ternation; was the rear of their army, where were a number of waggons, &amp;c. On our fir&s;t approach, we received a few &s;hot from their mu&s;quetry on the right in the fields. We continued our march to the heights on the left of the court-hou&s;e, and halted in a piece of woods; Gene|ral Wayne being forward, I heard him give orders to a hor&s;eman, to inform General Lee of the &s;itua|tion the Briti&s;h were in, and that a fairer pro&s;pect of attacking them with &s;ucce&s;s, never could be ex|hibited! but to our a&s;toni&s;hment, General Lee, had wheeled the whole of the infantry off to the right, except our regiment, and came on the rear of the enemy; but we, not knowing Lee's manoeuvres, marched down into the fields. Our dragoons, a|bout 50 in number, were forward, and appeared to form &s;ome di&s;tance on the right of our regiment, on which the Briti&s;h made a charge on them, and be|ing overpowered by numbers, they retreated; our regiment &s;upported them, and the Briti&s;h in turn were forced to give way, leaving two hor&s;es &s;hot dead. We retreated into the edge of a wood, where we &s;u&s;tained a cannonade from their artillery for nearly an hour, during which time the Briti&s;h were manoeuvring to form all their force together, in order to advance for battle. At length, a &s;trong party appeared in order to attack us, which our of|ficers perceiving, and finding the whole army was in motion, we retreated on the right of where Lee was; but, in fact, we had marched near two miles before we di&s;covered him; he was then making a &s;tand, but on the approach of the enemy (their dra|goons being in front and making a charge) our in|fantry immediately retreated, by order of General

Lee, as was &s;aid, and it is a matter I do not doubt, as the army continued to retreat until the Briti&s;h came fairly in &s;ight of our main army, commanded by General Wa&s;hington.&mdash;I mentioned that our re|giment was on the right flank, &s;ome con&s;iderable di&s;tance from Lee; indeed we were the whole re|treat oppo&s;ite the main Briti&s;h army; and on their making a halt, we al&s;o halted, about half a mile from them, in an orchard, when a party of Briti&s;h about equal to our number, advanced within mu&s;kes &s;hot of us, and a firing commenced on both &s;ides, in the open field (except a few apple-trees.) One cir|cum&s;tance which took place in the action, I remem|ber:&mdash;A certain William Orr, who was a corporal in the fir&s;t York regiment, appeared to be fitting down, and I, &s;uppo&s;ing he was wounded, went to him and a&s;ked what was the matter; he told me nothing;&mdash;that he was only fixing his gun, on which he immediately fired; and as near as I could tell, the ball fir&s;t &s;truck the ground, and by bouncing, killed an officer who was &s;tanding a &s;mall di&s;tance from a large old trunk of a tree, as at that very in|&s;tant the officer fell. It was judged that we conti|nued in the field, and &s;u&s;tained a con&s;tant fire, for about fifteen or twenty minutes, when Colonel Bar|ber came and &s;aid, it was the commander in chief's orders, that we &s;hould retreat. At this time, if I mi&s;take not, the Colonel, on his return to the main army, received a fle&s;h wound. We were ordered to go and take refre&s;hment, on which we marched about two miles in the rear of the army, the day be|ing exce&s;&s;ive hot, and having lo&s;t a number of men; out of three hundred and &s;ixty, we did not march more than one hundred and &s;ixty to camp, but num|bers returned the next day, having been &s;o overpow|ered with the heat, as to &s;ink under the fatigue.
<PB N="24" REF="027681_0022_0FD5DA4A2A2323D0">
The party of the Briti&s;h with which we were enga|ged, could not have been the troops who were fir&s;t &s;ent to attack us, as this party appeared to be detach|ed from their main army, and were approaching us when we halted, and what became of tho&s;e in our rear, I never could learn.</P>
<P>I remarked in a former part of this memoir, that the Briti&s;h appeared to be &s;truck with con&s;ternation; and tho&s;e &s;entiments are &s;till retained, as I imagine they were not aware of our army's being &s;o near them, particularly in &s;o early a part of the day; in|deed I believe they thought we would not attack them at all: but had we engaged them with the whole of our infantry at our fir&s;t approach, I am of opinion, nor can it be rever&s;ed, that we might have taken a large body of the rear of their army; and at that time my judgment was not alone. As to Lee, I can &s;ay by him as Michael did to the devil&mdash;"that he would bring no railing accu&s;ation again&s;t him, but the Lord rebuke thee:" &s;o I will not rail again&s;t the conduct of Lee, but if he has any con&s;cience, let him feel the rebuke of his country.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, on the &s;ame day, the New-York brigade, and &s;ome of the New-England troops, were ordered to march and make an attack on a party who had advanced on the right wing of the main army, nearly on the &s;ame &s;pot where we had been in the morning's &s;kirmi&s;h, where it was expect|ed a general battle would be brought on; but it did not happen, although the American troops had certainly the better of the ground; a number fell on both &s;ides, particularly the Briti&s;h. My re&s;pect|able friend Colonel Van Schaick, I under&s;tood be|haved with calmne&s;s and true courage during the action, as well as the officers in general of the York. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; indeed the whole divi&s;ion received the thanks
<PB N="25" REF="027681_0023_0FD5DA4A2617DC90">
of the commander in chief, for their good conduct. That night we lay on our arms, expecting the next morning to have a general battle, but the Briti&s;h had retreated from the ground in the dead of night, and left their killed on the field; the next day or|ders were given to bury them, and it was a melan|choly &s;pectacle, to &s;ee &s;o many dead bodies lay ex|po&s;ed to the elements, and the exce&s;&s;ive heat added to the &s;ight. We judged the Briti&s;h lo&s;t about five hundred men, and our army &s;omewhere between three and four hundred. There is no doubt with me, from the be&s;t information I could obtain, that had not the Briti&s;h retreated that night, the next day a general battle between the two main armies would have been inevitable, and the con&s;equence, on one &s;ide or the other (and perhaps on both) would undoubtedly have proved very &s;erious. Thus much may be &s;aid, that our main army lay in &s;ight of the Briti&s;h for about two thirds of the day, and &s;upported a heavy cannonade from their artillery, during which time the balls, &amp;c. were continually &s;creaming in the air, and &s;triking among&s;t them, to|gether with the almo&s;t intolerable heat of the day; all which they appeared to &s;upport with undaunted|ne&s;s and true courage. Our artillery in turn was &s;o well &s;erved on them, that the Briti&s;h conde&s;cend|ed to &s;ay, that in time they would become equal to veteran troops: but my opinion is, that a better &s;et of artillerymen never went into a field, than what America could that day boa&s;t of. In fact the Ame|rican army, generally &s;peaking, gained the mo&s;t un|fading laurels. This account of the battle of Mon|mouth, may prove very imperfect to a critical eye; but as it is only written for amu&s;ement, and on the &s;trength of memory, after the term of five years has elap&s;ed, tho&s;e who are better acquainted with the facts herein related, will, I tru&s;t, excu&s;e me.</P>

After the battle, the army was put under march|ing orders, and in two days arrived on the heights, above the town of Brun&s;wick. Our regiment en|camped on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Raritan river, the light infantry having again reverted to the &s;everal regiments to which they before belonged.</P>
<P>On the fourth day of July, being the &s;econd an|niver&s;ary of our independence, a &s;ue-de-joye was di&s;played by the army, it being formed in two lines on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river, on the heights oppo|&s;ite the bridge, and having the artillery placed with the &s;everal brigades, a running fire began from the right to the left, and &s;o on, through the two lines. My health on that day being &s;omewhat impaired, I did not join the army, but was a &s;pectator on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river. The regularity of the firings, as an ea&s;y and &s;teady running fire of mu&s;|ketry, and a di&s;charge of the artillery of each bri|gade at the in&s;tant the mu&s;ketry on their line cea&s;ed, together with a continued flame and &s;moke, added to the grandeur of the pro&s;pect, and be&s;poke the ap|pearance of a warlike people, contending for true liberty&mdash;What horrid engines of death appeared!&mdash;as if Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> Etna was vomiting forth from her volcanoes, fire and &s;moke.

<P>From Brun&s;wick, the army moved by divi&s;ions through Jer&s;ey, to Dobbs's Ferry, where they cro&s;&s;ed the North River, and pa&s;&s;ed on to the White Plains. By general orders, a draft was again made to form a light infantry brigade, which was com|manded by General Scott; old Doctor Skinner, was our head Surgeon, both of whom would now and then &s;wear a word. Capt. John Graham, Lieut. Charles Per&s;on, and my&s;elf, were drafted&punc; and we
<PB N="27" REF="027681_0025_0FD5DA3FD5987528">
joined Colonel Richard Butler's regiment. We marched down towards King&s;bridge, to a place call|ed Tuckehowe, and were &s;tationed in that part of the country to watch the motions of the Briti&s;h, who had arrived at New-York. They kept a &s;trong garri&s;on at King&s;bridge, and were often out into the country foraging, or marauding. Com|mands from our infantry were every day or two or|dered out to watch the motions of the enemy, and guards were al&s;o kept out &s;ome di&s;tance from our encampment, which made the infantry duty pretty hard. I think it was in September, when a party was &s;ent out towards King&s;bridge, under the com|mand of Major Stewart; we proceeded within one mile of the fort, when we were &s;uddenly fired on by the Briti&s;h, they being in the woods and our par|ty in a long open field; it appeared the enemy were almo&s;t round us before they began to fire. Major Stewart, with a few men, were on hor&s;eback; and although he never was called a coward, yet he turn|ed his hor&s;e with what dragoons were with him, and left us in the open field to &s;hift for our&s;elves. There was a captain by the name of Odale, a Lieu|tenant Williams, from Col. Graham's regiment of nine months or three years men, but am not certain, and if I mi&s;take not, Lieutenant John Hardenbergh&mdash;however, there were no more officers except my|&s;elf, and I think about forty-five or fifty privates. We were immediately charged on by a body of Briti&s;h dragoons, but every &s;oldier &s;tood his ground; and after the hor&s;e had fired on us with their car|bines, they retreated to load and charge on the par|ty again. We had at that time &s;ome Stockbridge Indians in our army, and if they had ri&s;en out of the ground they could not have appeared more unex|pected. The head warrior came foremo&s;t, calling
<PB N="28" REF="027681_0026_0FD5DA5ECDF52E60">
us cowards, becau&s;e we did not pur&s;ue the hor&s;e when they retreated; they being intoxicated with liquor, all arguments proved ineffectual; the hor&s;e made another charge, and then retreated, which the Indians perceiving, ran whooping and bellowing after them. Capt. Odale thought it be&s;t to march a party forward in order to &s;upport the Indians, and accordingly took I think &s;ixteen men; but the foot appearing to be marching in the &s;ame direction to a&s;&s;i&s;t the hor&s;e, they gave one more charge; on which the Indians took to their heels, and the field being very long the hor&s;e came up with them, and orders were given by the officer who commanded the dragoons, to give no quarters to the copper-heads, which was put in force, as they killed every one, except three, who were in the party, and mo&s;t inhumanly too. Poor Odale and his party were ta|ken pri&s;oners; but the re&s;t of us made our e&s;cape through a cornfield.</P>
<P>In a few weeks after, a con&s;iderable party of what was called Ya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gers, were out on their old trade, and our people falling in with them, killed and took eve|ry man.

pounds. Thus we went on from pillar to po&s;t, and from po&s;t to pillar, until the latter end of November, when our regiment was ordered to go to Fort Stan|wix; of con&s;equence, the York troops had to join their regiment which then lay at Peeks-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill, and from thence began our march and proceeded on to Fi&s;h-Kill, and in time arrived at Albany.</P>
<P>An anecdote occurs to my mind. On our pa&s;&s;age up the North river, we came to anchor not far from Claverack, and a number of officers, among whom I recollect were Lieut. Per&s;on, and James Bingham, and &s;ome others who&s;e names I have forgotten; however, we all went on &s;hore, and walked near or quite two miles into the country, to a public hou&s;e, to refre&s;h our&s;elves with &s;upper, &amp;c. and I think not a per&s;on had his &s;ide arms or any kind of weapon of defence; but being in our di&s;habille on board, went &s;o on &s;hore, or at lea&s;t we had not our re|gimentals. Upon our arrival at the Inn, we a&s;ked for &s;omething to drink; the landlord pretended he had nothing but &s;ower cider, which we took for granted, and called for &s;ome, and &s;ower enough it was; indeed it was &s;o bad we could not drink it. We then a&s;ked if he could mull &s;ome of it in eggs (u&s;ing their phra&s;e.) Why yes, he believed he could; but appeared to do it with reluctance, and when it came, it was curdled, and to make &s;hort, we could not drink it. We had called for victuals, but received very &s;urly an&s;wers&mdash;that there was no provi&s;ion in the hou&s;e, and &s;o on. At length the hou&s;e was &s;urround|ed with armed men, and a Captain of the militia came in and enquired very &s;trictly where we came from, and which way we were bound. We were at a lo&s;s what con&s;truction to put on &s;uch que&s;tions, but final|ly told them the regiment we bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ged to, and which way we were bound, but found great difficulty in
<PB N="30" REF="027681_0028_0FD5DA312A30B478">
making them believe us; and, if I mi&s;take not, they would put no confidence in what we &s;aid, until they had &s;ent down and &s;een the &s;loop, &amp;c. However, after they found us out, the Captain addre&s;&s;ed us in the following manner&mdash;"Well gentlemen, as I &s;up|po&s;e you be, for I am now convinced; you &s;ee here is my neighbour landlord, and I &s;uppo&s;ed he would not give you any thing to eat or drink, and he his not to blame, let you think what you will; for you know, neighbours, (for I mu&s;t now call you &s;o) that a number of vagrants are running through the coun|try pillaging, and what not; and then they run down to the Briti&s;h, or &s;omewhere el&s;e, and we were not certain but you were of that kind of people, as our neighbour landlord, &s;ent me word as &s;oon as you came to his hou&s;e, as how a party was there, and was di&s;tru&s;tful; and therefore we came to &s;ee who you were, and which away, and &s;o on. Why you have no regimentals, you have no &s;words, no bayo|nets, nor them long &s;ticks with &s;harp iron on the end, I forgot what they are called." We told him, we &s;uppo&s;ed he meant e&s;pontoons&mdash;"Ay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;pon|toons. Well, well, landlord, I believe the men are hone&s;t, let them have what they want." On which our generous landlord produced good liquors and an excellent &s;upper. We took care how we ventured on &s;hore again without our &s;ide arms, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>We continued a &s;hort time in Albany, and then marched to Schenectady. Our baggage was put in batteaus to go up the Mohawk river. On our ar|rival at Fort John&s;on we received the news that Cherry Valley was be&s;ieged, which occa&s;ioned our regiment to march early the next morning; and on our arrival at Colonel Clock's an expre&s;s came with information that the enemy had retreated. We continued on, as the weather was very cold (it
<PB N="31" REF="027681_0029_0FD5DA5323ED53A0">
being &s;ome time in the middle of December) &s;eve|ral &s;mall &s;nows fell during our march; but finally we arrived at the garri&s;on, not far from Chri&s;tma&s;s, where we were welcomed by Colonel Gan&s;evoort's officers, who, poor fellows, had been for a long time pent up in that garri&s;on. The next day they marched for Albany, (a di&s;tance of one hundred miles, a con&s;iderable part of which was through the woods)&mdash;We had not been long at Fort Stanwix, before our friendly Indians made application to have a fort picquetted in their town for them, as a defence again&s;t the Indians, who adhered to the crown of G. Britain; and the reque&s;t was thought &s;o rea&s;onable that a party of about forty men under the command of Captain John Wendell, Lieuten|ant Van Valkenburgh and my&s;elf, were &s;ent to the Oneida ca&s;tle. Our Lieutenant Colonel (Van-Dyke,) and my Lord Han&s;on; our i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;ary for the garri&s;on, accompanied us, and the next e|vening we had a grand ball or dance. I had never fairly &s;een one of their dances before, only a &s;mall &s;ketch at Skeen&s;borough, and was &s;o elevated that I became an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in their mu&s;ic; but I had to ex|tend my pipes &s;o high, and now and then being plyed with a gla&s;s of rum, (which I thought the Colonel or|ordered the oftener, to fix me) I finally grew fatigued with my birth, and &s;uddenly made my e&s;cape; two Indians followed to catch me, in order to return to the dance, but had not the good fortune to find me out that night. For a de&s;cription of their method of dancing, I &s;hall refer to where I was a pri&s;oner among them.</P>
<P>The next day all hands went to work, &s;ome one way and &s;ome another, in order to erect our fort. It was the &s;oldiers' duty to break the ground and dig the trenches for the piquets, which was done by
<PB N="32" REF="027681_0030_0FD5DA8CDC616D38">
giving every &s;oldier his ta&s;k, and that was, to cut twelve feet each man a day, two feet deep; and having &s;o many hands, we made fa&s;t work, although the &s;now and fro&s;t were very deep. The Indians drew the logs for picquets, and old Daniel Tucker laid out the fort; and &s;uch another I gue&s;s was ne|ver &s;een; but be it as it will, it had &s;everal corners &s;omething in form of Ba&s;tions. In one corner the Indians would cut a man's face on the picquets, which denoted one thing, the other corner another, and &s;o on; one was good news, another was bad news; and one was this name, and the other that; they called me <HI>Carrawhaxet,</HI> that is, <HI>Bad News;</HI> I have forgot the names given to the Captain and Van Val|kenburgh. We continued there about two weeks, when we were relieved by Captain John Copp, and returned to the garri&s;on. As this fort bu&s;ine&s;s is of &s;uch con&s;equence, I mu&s;t not forget to mention, that one corner was called Congre&s;s, another General Wa&s;hington, but Lee, I believe was left out. The winter was pa&s;&s;ed with a good degree of harmony in our quarters; we were &s;o indu&s;trious as to cut and draw our own fire-wood for the garri&s;on, at lea&s;t the &s;oldiers did it for us. One very hand&s;ome ball hap|pened among&s;t us, which was in my room; I only lo&s;t my benches and window-gla&s;s, which was made of paper, and a few other trifles.</P>
<P>In the latter end of March I was ordered on ex|pre&s;s to Fort Herkimer; but it being in the after|noon when I left home, and having to ride thirty miles, night came on before I could cro&s;s the river, at what was called Ori&s;ka, and a heavy &s;now &s;torm commencing, I had to &s;tay the whole night in the woods alone, without either fire or covering, except the canopy of Heaven, amid the &s;olemn &s;hades of a dark and beating &s;torm, expo&s;ed to wild bea&s;ts, and
<PB N="33" REF="027681_0031_0FD5DAA51251D5A8">
wor&s;e than all, the &s;avages were frequently making incur&s;ions on the cour&s;e I was ordered, which added not a little to the gloom of my &s;ituation. The day appearing, I pur&s;ued my journey, and &s;wam my hor&s;e acro&s;s the Mohawk at Shoemaker's; I rode on that &s;ide of the river to the fort, where I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> acro&s;s by a boat from the garri&s;on. In the after|noon I returned to Ori&s;ka, and tarried all night at an old Dutchman's hou&s;e; the man was from home, and the old lady &s;poke but very little Engli&s;h. She a&s;ked me if I could &s;peak Dutch; I told her (in Dutch) a little, which was all the Dutch I could produce from my &s;kill in that language, and I got &s;adly paid for it: for all the Engli&s;h eloquence I was ma&s;ter of, would not convince her but I could talk Dutch; and &s;he was &s;o offended, that I went to bed &s;upperle&s;s. The morning being clear and cold, I aro&s;e by break of day, and gave a boy a dollar to go with me to the river, as he &s;aid there was a canoe in which I could cro&s;s my&s;elf, and &s;wim my hor&s;e; but on coming to the river, the canoe was gone.

hard as ice could make them. I travelled a rough road, in that &s;ituation, until I arrived, and &s;hall ever think that I took &s;uch a cold on the occa&s;ion, that I never recovered until my return from captivity. A|bout this time, &s;ome troops arrived at our garri&s;on, but their intention was unknown. If I mi&s;take not, they were part of Colonel Gan&s;ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort's regiment, and one or two rifle companies. The Indians ap|peared very inqui&s;itive to know the meaning of their arrival, and was an&s;wered&mdash;'to reinforce and make an addition to the fort'&mdash;which the Oneidas appear|ed pacified with.</P>
<P>On the night of the 16th of April, &s;ome batteaus were cro&s;&s;ed from the Mohawk river to Wood Creek &s;o privately, that &s;carcely any one in the gar|ri&s;on, except the guards, knew any thing of the af|fair; but, previous to the movement of the boats, every officer and private received orders to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to go on command. Some time before day, the garri&s;on troops and tho&s;e who joined them, con&s;i&s;ting of about five hundred men, were under way to Wood Creek: the baggage was put on board the boats, and the main body marched to the Oneida lake, a party being left, &s;ufficient to manage the boats; I was with them; we arri|ved at the lake and took refre&s;hment about day-light-in, and then the whole of the troops embarked on board the boats, and made their way on the lake. About ten o'clock, we arrived at an i&s;land oppo&s;ite Fort Brewington, at the mouth, being the furthe&s;t end of the lake, which is computed to be thirty-&s;ix miles in length. The party was immediately put on &s;hore, and under way for the Onondaga town, com|manded by Colonel Van Schaick of the 1&s;t New-York regiment, and Lieut. Col. Willett, of the 2d New-York regiment; Major Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hran was the other

field officer. I was ordered to &s;tay and take the command of the boats. The party proceeded and lay on their arms that night; the next morning, by ten o'clock, they &s;urrounded and took a number of pri&s;oners, and brought them off, with &s;ome valuable trinkets which belonged to the Indians; they burnt their town, de&s;troyed their corn, and what they met in their way of cattle, grain, &amp;c. They returned the day following to the boats, when we all em|barked, cro&s;&s;ed the lake, and the next day arrived at our garri&s;on.</P>
<P>I would here remark&mdash;that this expedition was conducted with &s;uch &s;ecrecy and judgment, that an in&s;tance of the kind was not common, and received the thanks of the commander in chief.</P>
<P>Nothing material happened from that time (except that &s;erjeant Bogert and &s;ome privates, were taken pri|&s;oners by the Indians on the 4th of June,) until the fatal 23d of July, 1779. It was my tour to go on command, as a guard to a party of men who were making hay, in the meadow about half a mile below the fort. The ground on which the men were at work, was a nar|row &s;trip, having the woods on one &s;ide, and the Mohawk river on the other, and extended about one mile in length; the party under my command, con|&s;i&s;ted of one &s;erjeant, one corporal and twenty-eight privates. We &s;aw that morning over the Mohawk river, an uncommon &s;moke, and the centinels at the fort, &s;aid they had &s;een &s;ome Indian dogs, which was not common: however, therein I believe they were mi&s;taken; for the Indians never take dogs with them to war, or, at lea&s;t, I never heard of it: &s;till I had a &s;u&s;picion that an enemy was near, and expre&s;&s;|ed my &s;entiments to Captain John Graham. We left the fort by &s;un-ri&s;e in the morning, and march|ed within about one hundred yards of where the
<PB N="36" REF="027681_0034_0FD5DAA0F71699A0">
guard had lain the day before. It had been a rule to &s;end fourteen of the guard as centinels along the woods; and although I thought at that time it was improper, I dare not break the rules which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, of con&s;equence the centi|nels were placed, with orders (in ca&s;e of an alarm) to make immediately for the party. There were &s;till &s;ome hillocks of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ortification at the landing place, which had been put up the la&s;t French war, and the party were ordered if attacked, to all make for that place fir&s;t; but no &s;ooner were the centinels placed, than the Indians laying then in ambu&s;h, immediately ru&s;hed on them and took every man, and fired on us; the party received orders not to di&s;charge their pieces, but we had a mulatto fellow who &s;tarted to run, and on being ordered to his ranks, returned and fired into the woods, and the whole guard fired likewi&s;e; on which the Indians made their appearance in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ield. We were only mu&s;ket &s;hot from the woods, and their number amounted to three hundred and &s;ixty Indians; the guard in &s;pite of any further ef|fort endeavored promi&s;cuou&s;ly to make their e&s;cape, but were every man taken:&mdash;and in fact, to &s;ee &s;o ma|ny &s;avages appear ru&s;hing on towards us almo&s;t naked, and painted up with their warlike figures, with &s;uch engines of death in their hands, and whooping and yelling like &s;o many infernal fiends, mu&s;t make the &s;toute&s;t heart that ever exi&s;ted, quake with &s;ear; in particular, when there appears no kind of relief. After all of us were taken, we were led from the meadow, and the Indians received &s;everal &s;hot from the cannon of the fort. Captain Graham, came out with a &s;trong party from the garri&s;on for our relief, but it was all in vain; indeed the garri&s;on u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavors to re-take us again; but I am of opinion, had any of the Indians been killed, the whole
<PB N="37" REF="027681_0035_0FD5DAB176C5DDA8">
of the pri&s;oners would have been immediately put to death. I will further remark, that had we have had our bayonets (which for &s;ome rea&s;on were not with the guard) and all of us been in one body and not di&s;charged our pieces, the Indians would have never entered in the open field again&s;t us.</P>
<P>We were immediately taken beyond the &s;luice, at an old fort which had been built la&s;t French war, called Newport, where poor old Monday, a &s;oldier, being wounded, was immediately tomahawked and &s;calped. The Indians then had five &s;calps, but I never could find out what men were killed, except the one ju&s;t mentioned. We were then &s;tripped, ex|cept a &s;hirt and &s;mall-clothes; my &s;word and chain with my hat were taken from me by the Indian who took me fir&s;t; but as to my other clothes, boots, &amp;c. they were taken from me &s;o &s;uddenly, that I did not know who had them. The weather was &s;o extreme|ly warm, I could never have undergone the march, had not my clothes been taken from me. We after|wards had all our arms pinioned, and a tump line, or &s;lat braided &s;tring, put round our necks; I received from a Mr. Larama, a Frenchman, with the rank of a Lieutenant in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, a cap and pair of mocki&s;ons; &s;everal of the pri&s;oners received mock|i&s;ons from Mr. Larama, who was a kind tender heart|ed man. When the pri&s;oners were ordered to march, they con&s;i&s;ted of one lieutenant, two &s;erjeants, one corporal and twenty-eight privates, in all thirty-two, as the mowing party was al&s;o taken. We &s;uddenly heard a heavy firing in our rear, which I took to be our party from the fort, and then expected in&s;tant death, which feelings are &s;o awful, that language is inadequate to expre&s;s them; but when reflecting on the torture which I expected we mu&s;t all undergo (as I had no other thought left, but of being burnt and
<PB N="38" REF="027681_0036_0FD5DA96B702E6A8">
tortured to death in the manner the Indians general|ly do) I mu&s;t confe&s;s I felt a calm re&s;ignation to the fatal &s;troke; but the &s;kirmi&s;h proved by Mr. Larama's account, to have been our Indians, and the party who took us, making a &s;ham-fight, as the Indians from the fort, pretended they mu&s;t fight, or our great people, the rebels, would blame them, and then gave a whoop, pretending the enemy were too &s;trong for them, and ran off to the garri&s;on. Our arms be|ing all pinioned, we &s;tarted, and went on a trot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> eve|ry &s;tep to the Pine Ridge, where we made a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> minutes halt, it being about ten miles; we then turned off to the right, and went, as I judge, a north northwe&s;t cour&s;e, until about twelve o'clock, march|ing very fa&s;t; as it is cu&s;tomary for Indians when they take pri&s;oners, to run with them for a con&s;idera|ble di&s;tance, pretending the enemy may follow them; although I am per&s;uaded they were under no &s;uch apprehen&s;ions on this occa&s;ion. After we halted, I was offered &s;ome parched corn, pounded coar&s;e and put in water; but being very unwel with a billious complaint, which had been on me from the time the Onondagas were cut off, I could not eat; nor had I, for a long time before, lived on any thing but boiled milk in &s;pikenard, with a trifle of bread; any food of a coar&s;e nature, was like embers in my bow|els. The Indians took &s;everal hor&s;es from the fort, and had them with them. We re&s;ted about one hour, and then pur&s;ued our march very fa&s;t. The weather was warm and &s;uffocating, particularly in our &s;ituation, being confined with a large number of Indians in the woods, which rendered the air more conden&s;ed than u&s;ual: I was almo&s;t faint unto death. We marched until &s;un-down, and by Mr. Larama's account, were forty miles from Fort Stanwix. They made fires and cooked &s;ome wheat meal, and a few
<PB N="39" REF="027681_0037_0FD5DA9E5EB4F258">
&s;mall pieces of pork boiled up in water, and made not unpalatable &s;oup, with a few cakes baked, which the pri&s;oners each had a &s;mall &s;hare of. After &s;up|per, one of the chiefs aro&s;e, and made a lengthy &s;peech, during which I felt very unea&s;y, as I ex|pected, after he had fini&s;hed, the torture on the pri|&s;oners would commence; but to my inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, for that time, Mr. Larama told me that the purport of his &s;peech was, to divide the pri&s;oners a|mong the different nations, which he was in hopes would not ma&s;&s;acre us. The party con&s;i&s;ted of Co|no&s;edagoes, Mohawks, Tauwaus, Caughnawagoes, Jebowees, and Tu&s;karoras; two Canadians and a white woman were with the Indians, be&s;ides Mr. Larama. I fell to a chief of the Cono&s;edago nation; and on being delivered to my ma&s;ter, he gave three long whoops, &s;eemingly with a mournful tone, and in an in&s;tant, a di&s;mal yell, which the whole joined in. At this time in their ceremonies, I was informed that death or mercy was the event; and, as they had concluded on mercy (which I was ignorant of) joy rebounded through the camp. Good God! what a &s;cene was this to with&s;tand!&mdash;No language can expre&s;s, no eloquence can paint, no tongue can utter, what horrid ideas mu&s;t impre&s;s the mind at &s;o awful a cri&s;is&mdash;the thought of being bound in thongs, and put to death by inches, is terrible beyond all imagination. The whole of the pri&s;oners were handed to their different ma&s;ters in the &s;ame manner that I was, by giving three long and mournful whoops, and then three loud yells; and after they had fini&s;hed dividing the pri&s;oners, they gave three long, loud, di&s;tinct yells, which, by Mr. Larama's information, was a token of mercy.</P>
<P>After they had done, I de&s;ired Mr. Larama to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion, in my name, for me to addre&s;s them
<PB N="40" REF="027681_0038_0FD5DABE2DB93728">
in a few words, which was con&s;ented to; and I &s;tood up and thanked them for their kind care and goodne&s;s to the pri&s;oners. I told them, that if I lived to return home, I would mention it to our great people&mdash;that I was &s;omething unwel when taken, but knew their goodne&s;s &s;o well, that they would march a little flower, rather than I &s;hould die like a bea&s;t, in the woods&mdash;that it was not common for warriors to murder their pri&s;oners; it was only cowards reckoned among us, who abu&s;ed pri&s;oners; and that I had no doubt, after this uproar was over, we &s;hould meet and &s;hake hands: which Mr. Lara|ma interpreted for me. They thanked me for my &s;peech; and my chief &s;aid he would protect me thro' the woods, if I was not able to march; but I did not put much faith in what he &s;aid. That night &s;ome of our Oneida Indians came from Fort Stanwix af|ter their hor&s;es, which they &s;aid belonged to them, and it being confirmed by the pri&s;oners, they were given up; on which the Oneidas (by Mr. Larama's account) inquired whether the Indians had any of the Briti&s;h among them; and was an&s;wered in the negative. The Oneidas told them it was very well; and if they came without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ti&s;h &s;oldiers, they might take as many of the Yan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> as they plea&s;ed, for they would meet with no hindrance from them.&mdash;After this, the Oneida Indians took the hor&s;es back, which, in fact, belonged to the garri&s;on. I was a&s;ked who&s;e hor&s;es they were, but an&s;wered that I could not tell; as I &s;uppo&s;ed, being an officer, had I have told them a lie, they, perhaps, would have made a &s;erious matter of it. After all the&s;e ceremo|nies, I had my arms unpinioned, with the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners, and a cord tied to each arm; an old blanket <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as &s;pread for me, and I laid down between two Indians, and &s;oon &s;ell a&s;leep. I was awakened
<PB N="41" REF="027681_0039_0FD5DABFB25884F0">
the next morning, by day break, to prepare for marching, which was done by an Indian ri&s;ing and calling how, how, how; on which, in an in&s;tant, every Indian was on his feet under way, in Indian file; indeed &s;ome warning for marching was given beforehand, when they all &s;at with their knap&s;acks ready fixed, but from the time the word was given to denote march, I am certain the whole party was under way in a minute, and then a continual firing was kept up for (I judge) four miles. We travel|led till about ten o'clock, and by going a very fa&s;t walk, I was exceedingly faint; but eating &s;ome of their doe cakes, I felt revived. We halted about half an hour, and then &s;et off and travelled until two o'clock, when we again halted for an hour. We then &s;tarted, and continued a &s;teady march until a|bout &s;un an hour high, when John Gro&s;s, a &s;oldier from Captain John Copp's company, was &s;o fatigued that he was unable to proceed; he &s;aid he had the cramp, but if he could re&s;t a few minutes, he &s;hould be able to go on again. I was allowed to &s;tand and talk with him a few minutes, but was ordered to march on. About &s;un-down we halted, when I was informed that poor old Gro&s;s was tomahawked and &s;calped. He belonged to the nation I was commit|ted to, was about fifty years of age, and had a fami|ly near Albany; and what made it appear more &s;e|rious, he went on duty as a volunteer, in the place of another man. We &s;upped on our u&s;ual diet, and being faint and fatigued, and reflecting al&s;o on the treachery of the Indians in their conduct towards Gro&s;s, as they left &s;ome young men with him, who pretended they would &s;tay until he recovered and a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but on the contrary, they killed him in a few minutes after the party pa&s;&s;ed by; and being in the mid&s;t of their whoopings, &s;creamings and
<PB N="42" REF="027681_0040_0FD5DAC5173E12C0">
yellings, I could &s;ometimes &s;carcely think my&s;elf a|mong human beings, as I could not have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o uncommon a contra&s;t in the di&s;play of mortals, ever po&s;&s;ible. I was again tied, as u&s;ual, and hav|ing a blanket &s;pread for me, &s;oon fell a&s;leep. I was awaked at the break of day, and informed that our provi&s;ions grew &s;cant, and having left &s;ome on their way, they were going to make a force march to the place where their provi&s;ions were left, which was a long day's journey; and being on the twenty-fifth day of July, my birth-day, gave me &s;ome re|flections on the manner in which it was cu&s;tomary (for officers in particular) to celebrate the day of their birth, which is generally in fe&s;tivity; or at lea&s;t, if any notice be taken of a birth day it mu&s;t be done in merriment, and commonly with exce&s;s, which is certainly contrary to a right under&s;tanding of the day; for &s;urely, at the expiration of each year we are &s;o much nearer the clo&s;e of life, and mu&s;t &s;o much &s;ooner give an account, not only of our con|duct the year pa&s;t, but al&s;o the whole of our mi&s;s-&s;pent time.</P>
<P>We were &s;oon under way, and marched very fa&s;t until ten o'clock, when we made a halt. The wea|ther being very warm, I was never nearer fainting&punc; but eating a piece of their doe cake, and re&s;ting a|bout half an hour, felt more revived, although I was the whole time in great di&s;tre&s;s in my bowels, as my food was of little u&s;e to me. We &s;tarted and travelled till two o'clock, when we arrived at one of their encampments, where we re&s;ted about half an hour, eat &s;ome victuals, and again proceeded on our journey. About &s;un-down we arrived at ano|ther of their encampments, where were the provi|&s;ions they had left on their way. We all &s;upped on &s;oup made of a few pieces of pork cut into &s;mall
<PB N="43" REF="027681_0041_0FD5DAC7F46D0540">
pieces (like crumbs of bread) &s;ome beans, and flour, boiled together, which was a great repa&s;t. I mu&s;t &s;ay the pri&s;oners were u&s;ed well, con&s;idering the &s;i|tuation we were in. My chief gave me that day, a callico wai&s;tcoat. The Indians appeared to be more &s;ociable; and Mr. Larama informed me, that by ten o'clock the next day, we &s;hould reach the boats on Lake Ontario. I &s;lept that night very comfort|ably.</P>
<P>At break of day on the 26th, we were called on to march. My feet were &s;ore, having only a thin pair of mocki&s;ons, made of deer's leather, and the land being rooty and braky, with &s;everal low inter|vales, &s;ome pine lands and &s;everal hemlock &s;wamps, although the land in general was level, or there were no mountains to pa&s;s, and few &s;tones. We marched until about nine o'clock, and forded a large creek, an entire rock on the bottom, as &s;mooth as a &s;late; but in &s;ome places there were pretty large holes where the &s;almon kept; our Indian boys catched &s;everal and brought them on their march. This creek empties into Lake Ontario. After we pa&s;&s;ed the creek &s;ome di&s;tance, we halted and re&s;ted for a|bout fifteen minutes, at which time, &s;ome of the able&s;t of the pri&s;oners were &s;ent off with a party of young Indians, to get to the boats and prepare vic|tuals again&s;t the whole came up. We pur&s;ued our journey; the land being more uneven than what we were accu&s;tomed to, made it more toil&s;ome, as we walked fa&s;t; but about half pa&s;t twelve o'clock, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, we arrived at the boats, where the party that had gone before us had &s;ome victuals ready cooked. We all refre&s;hed our&s;elves on &s;ome fi&s;h, and our u&s;ual diet, and I felt my&s;elf great|ly revived, particularly with the thoughts of the fa|tiguing march being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.&mdash;This part of the Journ|al

is written in Provo&s;t at Quebec, in September, 1779, and it is on the &s;trength of my memory; but however far I may err in judgment, it was the opinion of Mr. Larama, &s;erjeants Weed and De|fere&s;t, (the two la&s;t were pri&s;oners) that we travel|ed one hundred and fifty miles; they &s;aid, perhaps one hundred and &s;eventy, but at a moderate computa|tion, it was what was fir&s;t mentioned, through ex|cellent land, &s;ome white-oak timber, but the main part beech and maple; the &s;oil black and rich, very little mountainous or broken lands, and clear of &s;tones; I did not notice any but would admit of im|provement.</P>
<P>Our boats lay in a creek, about two miles from Lake Ontario; and, as near as I can judge, about twenty leagues from Bucks, or what the Briti&s;h call Carlton I&s;land; they con&s;i&s;ted of Briti&s;h batteaus and Indian canoes. The canoes were made of birch bark, lined with &s;plints, and &s;ewed together with &s;trings made out of the roots of elm. Some of their canoes will carry twenty and &s;ome thirty men; and are &s;o light that two of their boys could carry them. After refre&s;hing our&s;elves, we embarked on board of the boats, about two o'clock; I was placed in the &s;tern of their bark canoe, next to the &s;teer&s;man, and was not allowed to row. We &s;tood, as near as I could gue&s;s, after coming into the lake, about a north cour&s;e, acro&s;s the ea&s;t end of Lake Ontario, rowing fa&s;t until the &s;un went down. One thing I thought much of, the Indian who took me fir&s;t was in the canoe, and was a young, &s;mart likely fellow; before I gave up, he was within about &s;ix rods of me, and frequently ordered me to &s;top, but not obeying him, he levelled his piece to fire at me, and &s;he &s;napped; on which I &s;aw him fixing her to fire, and finding no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, handed my &s;word; he returned

There were &s;ome gulls flying over the lake, and one hovering over us, he made &s;igns for me to take his gun and &s;hoot it, it being the &s;ame he had &s;napped at me; I took the gun and &s;hot the gull; and after it was brought into the canoe, there being one Indian on board who &s;poke a little Engli&s;h, I made him under&s;tand, that when the owner of the gun &s;napped it at me, it did not go off; the Indian who under&s;tood me, telling him of it, he immediate|ly pointed upwards, and made &s;everal je&s;tures. I a&s;ked what it meant, and the Indian told me, that the man &s;aid the Great Spirit would not let his gun go off when it was pointed at me.</P>
<P>We came to an i&s;land, and put up a few miles from the mouth of the river St. Lawrence, at which place we catched &s;almon and O&s;wego ba&s;s. On the morning of the 27th, we embarked and rowed about ten miles, when we came to an i&s;land, within &s;ight of the garri&s;on, called Carlton I&s;land. The Indians painted them&s;elves and all the pri&s;oners, ex|cept my&s;elf; I &s;poke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to Mr. Larama about my clothes, and mentioned, that if the Indians would let me appear among&s;t the Briti&s;h like an American officer, I would be happy, and they could take my clothes again; On which Mr. Larama, took me to the different boats, and my clothes, even to my boots, were returned; but having a long beard, and my linen not of the white&s;t kind, I did not make &s;o great a figure. We then embarked, and &s;ailed un|der a &s;mall breeze, for the fort; we were met a|bout a mile from the garri&s;on, by a large gun-boat. The Indians lowered all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ails, which appeared like a &s;mall fleet, as that morning every one put up &s;omething in &s;hape of a &s;quare-&s;ail, and of different

colours&mdash;Some were red, with one or two white &s;treaks through them; &s;ome of one, and &s;ome of an|other colour. The boats were all in a line, about one hundred yards apart; tho&s;e who had &s;calps, hoi&s;ted them up at the bow of their boat: the &s;calps, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut round and fa&s;tened on a pole, with the fle&s;h part painted red. Immediately on their low|ering &s;ail, on the approach of the gun-boat, &s;he and all the Indians lay on their oars, when a general &s;i|lence en&s;ued. At length, an Indian on the right of the line, gave as many long whoops as the nation to which he belonged had pri&s;oners and &s;calps; the next nation in turn gave the &s;ame whoop, and &s;o on through the &s;ix nations, three times over, which took I judge, near an hour; it &s;eemed when they began with their whoop, they would hold their breath for a minute, and the intervals between the nations, made the &s;cene melancholy indeed; when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hey had done with their long whoops, they all gave three di&s;mal yells, beginning on the right and con|tinuing to the left. As &s;oon as they had fini&s;hed that part of their ceremony, the gun-boat turned and made &s;ail for &s;hore; the Indians then began a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fire from right to left three times over, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> great degree of regularity, and then the whole as one voice, gave three yells, and was an&s;wered from the garri&s;on by the di&s;charge of three cannon.

the &s;hore. I was ordered to &s;tand up in the canoe, on our near approach to the garri&s;on, and had no objection, as there were a number of tories, old de|&s;erters from our army and country, &amp;c. who were making their remarks on us in general, which was not done in a very familiar way of conver&s;ation. We pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome little di&s;tance along the i&s;land be|fore landing, and on going a&s;hore, which the Indians pretty nearly &s;truck together, and were then as &s;till as the Pacific ocean, in a calm. On my landing, I was &s;urrounded by a great number of gazing &s;pec|tators, as if I had come from &s;ome planet or other. A tory officer a&s;ked me for the fir&s;t que&s;tion, the &s;trength of Fort Stanwix; I returned for an&s;wer, that being a pri&s;oner of war, it was the rule of all chri&s;tiani&s;ed nations to treat them well, and that he in a regimental dre&s;s, which be&s;poke him an officer, certainly mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the que&s;tion improper: how|ever, I received from the rabble &s;ome heavy de|nunciations, as rebel, &amp;c. which is improper to commit to a journal. My having on the regimentals of our regiment at the time, I &s;uppo&s;e occa&s;ioned more cu|rio&s;ity among&s;t them, than perhaps would have o|therwi&s;e been &s;hewn; but I was not long in that &s;ituation before a young gentleman by the name of Smith, an Adjutant of a Briti&s;h regiment, came and informed me, that the commanding officer de|&s;ired me to repair to head-quarters. I went with him, and on entering the room was met by Major Naron, the commanding officer, who acco&s;ted me very civilly, and invited me to breakfa&s;t, which I readily accepted of; and I believe the whole of the garri&s;on officers of the Briti&s;h line were at breakfa&s;t. I continued at head-quarters until one o'clock. Mr. Smith made me a pre&s;ent of a &s;ilk handkerchief. The Major a&s;ked me in private, a few que&s;tions re|lative

to our main army, and General Sullivan's movements; but I knew but trifling about either, &amp; was rather more ignorant at that time than common. I mentioned to one of the officers, that I thought the Indians mu&s;t be of great expence to the crown, as the &s;cout that took us had expended a great deal of provi&s;ion, and were on their return back, con&s;tantly firing and wa&s;ting their ammunition. He told me that he had made a computation of the expence the party was at that had taken us, and it could not fall much &s;hort (if any) of one thou&s;and eight hundred pounds &s;terling money, or that would be the expend|iture by the time the Indians gave the pri&s;oners all up. It &s;eems that we had three young kings in the party, and they being all Canadian Indians, (which I was ignorant of until we got to Lake Ontario) leave was a&s;ked to addre&s;s the commanding officer; which was con&s;ented to; and after the Major had &s;eated him&s;elf, the three young Blood Royals were admit|ted to a &s;eat not far from him; an interpreter was at hand, and an old Chief aro&s;e with a great deal of compo&s;ure, and addre&s;&s;ed his Kings in a long and &s;pirited &s;peech, whil&s;t the old Major who was a Scotchman, and as much of a gentleman as walked the Briti&s;h army, &s;at knitting his brows, not under|&s;tanding a word, as I took it; and after the Chief had fini&s;hed, the Major addre&s;&s;ed the interpreter&mdash;"weal and what is all this? Whey do they want now." The interpreter mentioned, that the pur|port of their &s;peech was, that they and a number of their ance&s;tors had been old &s;ervants to their Great Father, who lived acro&s;s the big water, and that they (the party) had now &s;eriou&s;ly taken up the hatchet for his defence, and meant at all times to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to go out again&s;t the people who &s;at around the council fire, and who had

<P>The old Major, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as follows&mdash;"And what is it they want&mdash;a barrel of rum, to get all drunk and kill the pri&s;oners.

About one o'clock, my chief came for me to go to the boat, in order to &s;et off. I took my leave of the gentlemen, who treated me with a great de|gree of politene&s;s, I mean tho&s;e of the line in the Briti&s;h army; as to the tory officers, there was not common notice taken of them. We all &s;at off, and went on our way down the river St. Lawrence, which is very deep and of an ea&s;y current. I re|ceived, as we glided along &s;hore, &s;ome very in&s;ulting language from men who had de&s;erted from our re|giment. The river I &s;uppo&s;ed two miles wide.&mdash;We rowed about thirty miles, and lay that night on the we&s;tern &s;hore; the Indians &s;hot &s;ome fowls, &s;uch as gulls, and a few other kinds, and catched &s;ome fi&s;h.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 28th, before day, we were all under way down the river, and &s;un about half an hour high, &s;hot &s;ome ducks that could not fly, as I was informed, they had &s;hed their feathers. They were fine and fle&s;hy, but of what kind I cannot tell; &s;ome

About nine o'clock we came too, and cooked our fowls. Our boat that morning was ahead, and the batteaus being heavy, were generally in the rear. I cool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d a duck, and found it delicious food. We embarked in about an hour, and rowed &s;teady until four o'clock, when we arrived at O&s;wegotia, a Brit|i&s;h garri&s;on, about thirty-five leagues from Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ton i&s;land, and the whole of the way a gradual &s;till cur|rent; the river appeared &s;o deep, that I judge a ve&s;|&s;el of heavy burthen might pa&s;s up and down. I was invited into the quarters of Captain Robert&s;on, who was commanding officer, and received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e into his room with ho&s;pitality, as him&s;elf and a Captain Frazier, who was there, had been taken pri&s;oners, at St. John's, and were through Elizabeth-Town; and after being informed that it was my native place, they appeared to give me every mark of their friend&s;hip, as well as the other pri&s;oners, who all ar|rived a &s;hort time after us. I continued at head quarters until about midnight, and fared as well as I could wi&s;h. I told Capt.

We continued along &s;hore for better than an hour, the water grow|ing &s;omething &s;moother; the Indians in our boat &s;aw a large buck &s;wimming, they made after him and he was &s;oon overtaken and killed. About two o'clock came too and dre&s;&s;ed the veni&s;on; he was divided into as many parts as there were Indians and pri&s;oners, and after being boiled, every per&s;on had their piece. We then &s;at off, and in half an hour arrived at an Indian town called Tu&s;kerora, where one of the nations that were in the party lived; &s;ix of the pri&s;oners fell to them, and were put on &s;hore; we tarried half an hour, and then proceeded, leaving the &s;ix pri&s;oners mentioned, with them; the current not being &s;o rapid, and after having a &s;mall thunder-gu&s;t (which occa&s;ioned a fair wind) we put up our &s;ail and ran about ten miles, to a &s;mall Lake in the river, about thirteen miles in length, and four in breadth, which we cro&s;&s;ed that afternoon and e|vening.

<P>On the thirtieth, early in the morning, we em|barked and went about fifteen or twenty miles down the river with a forcable current. Two Indians, with one of the pri&s;oners and my&s;elf were put on &s;hore; we travelled about two miles and &s;topped at a Frenchman's hou&s;e, who gave us &s;ome bread and milk, and each a twi&s;t of tobacco.

on about eight miles and came to our boats, which were two miles up the river, that leads out of the Lake of two mountains into St. Lawrence; there were two nations at this place called Cono&s;odagoes and Mohawks; the other three nations, lived farther down the river St. Lawrence&mdash;we embarked and rowed up the river near thirty miles, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;e|veral French &s;ettlements and Indian huts, but were met about ten miles from the Lake, by two canoes, having &s;ome of their chiefs on board, who congratu|lated their friends and brothers, as they were from the &s;ame town to which our party belonged. We all rowed until we came to the lake, and put up on an i&s;land about two miles from their town, where the Indians painted them&s;elves and the pri&s;oners. We had a vi&s;it from a number of boats from the town, having Squaws on board, who brought cakes for their friends and the pri&s;oners; the &s;quaws ap|peared to have the immediate rule and conduct of the pri&s;oners; I was put into a canoe with &s;ome of the chiefs' wives. We then rowed for the town, leaving all the Indians and pri&s;oners behind on the i&s;land.

After being a few minutes &s;eated by the mother of the young &s;quaw in a decent chair, and &s;ome drink being prepared for me, I made &s;igns that I wanted to go to the door to &s;ee the pri&s;oners come in; which was granted. Previous to the approach of the Indians, a cannon that was in town, was load|ed
<PB N="53" REF="027681_0051_0FD5DA9B0BE07378">
and prepared, and al&s;o, a large flag-&s;taff was &s;tanding with the colours flying. The Indians ap|peared on the lake, moving very &s;lowly all in a line, and on their near approach, gave a running fire from right to left, and was an&s;wered by the di&s;|charge of their cannon, which was repeated three times over. They then exerted them&s;elves to get on &s;hore, in the &s;ame manner as at Carlton I&s;land. An Indian boy took one of the pri&s;oners by the hand and ran to the flag-&s;taff; they appeared promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly to every one catch at the fir&s;t pri&s;oner they could get hold of, and immediately run to the &s;taff, until they had all arrived; the whole of the Indians and pri&s;oners then danced round the flag for about fifteen minutes, and all at once, each Indian who had his pri&s;oner, &s;at off running and pulling his pri&s;on|er with him as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to the council hou&s;e, and all the re&s;t of the Indians after them yelling and &s;creaming with all their might; they continued dancing with the pri&s;oners for near half an hour, the whole time &s;inging a war &s;ong, and then each Indian took his pri&s;oner home with him, without being the lea&s;t abu&s;ed or hurt, and gave them pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ty of provi&s;ions.&mdash;What a happy circum&s;tance was this! for in&s;tead of being bound in thongs, and &s;uffering the mo&s;t excruciating tortures, by having the finger nails torn out, and pine knots drove into the fle&s;h and &s;at on fire, with many other unheard of tortures, we were all treated like chri&s;tians, not e|ven having been compelled to run what is termed the gantlet, although it is cu&s;tomary for the Indians to form two lines, about &s;ix feet apart, between which the pri&s;oners mu&s;t run and receive blows with fi&s;ts, clubs, and &s;ometimes tomahawks, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e fre|quently killed. What a heart of gratitude, I felt on this occa&s;ion, to my God and the Great Pre&s;erver of
<PB N="54" REF="027681_0052_0FD5DA8E2E913038">
men. One thing I would not wi&s;h to omit on this occa&s;ion, and which I &s;uppo&s;e was a favor to the pri&s;oners. There were in the town, a large cha|pel, or hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, and three Roman clergy|men re&s;ided among the &s;avages, by which means the town is under &s;trict and religious regulations, according to their manner of wor&s;hipping, and ap|pears with &s;olemnity. I was vi&s;ited by the three gentlemen, and invited to dine with them, which I readily accepted of, and was received with as great a degree of cordiality as I ever met with in any place. I continued to dine and &s;up with them during my &s;tay at the place, as it was cu&s;tomary to break|fa&s;t at home on bread and milk, and &s;ometimes tea&mdash;The catholic prie&s;ts make no formal breakfa&s;t, as they generally, and I believe always, attend to prayers from 6 until 9 or ten in the morning, and then take a cut of bread and chee&s;e, or &s;ome light diet, but regularly dine at twelve on rich food, ex|cept Friday and Saturday; they eat no meat on tho&s;e days, but fi&s;h, butter, eggs, &amp;c. is their diet. The Indians are very attentive on ma&s;s, and &s;ing melodiou&s;ly, particularly the women; every morn|ing and evening they all attend wor&s;hip, and on their bended knees &s;eem to offer &s;incere devotion to the King of Kings. I was &s;trictly attentive to their ma&s;s, as it would have even di&s;plea&s;ed what we deem the wild &s;avage of the woods, not to have paid my devotion with them.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, a large Indian came to my quarters and ordered me by &s;igns to take off my coat and jacket, which I at once complied with; he then brought me a long coat, wai&s;tcoat, and leggons, and dre&s;&s;ed me in the manner of them&s;elves, and then took me to the flag-&s;taff, where, after giving three long and &s;olemn whoops, the whole of the
<PB N="55" REF="027681_0053_0FD5DAADD70F3E78">
town appeared in&s;tantly to a&s;&s;emble. One of the chiefs made a lengthy and loud &s;peech, and from what I could gather, the purport was,&mdash;that after a lo&s;s cometh gain; &s;tating the &s;ucce&s;s they had gained by their arms, and that now, having pri&s;oners in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they could be put in the place of &s;ome of their lo&s;t relatives: on which I was adopted by one of the chief's in&s;tead of an uncle he had lo&s;t about a year before, and who I under&s;tood died a natural death. They have no very formal way of adopting, except by laying their hands on the pri&s;oner's head, and a few ceremonies of the like in the time of their orations, and then he is delivered to the man by whom adopted, who in a friendly manner takes him by the hand and ki&s;&s;es him, and then the &s;quaws, (every one who bears any relation to the family wherein the pri&s;oner is adopted.) The whole of the pri&s;oners were &s;erved in the &s;ame way. I am of opinion, &s;hould this journal be read, &s;ome will &s;ay that when the Indians adopt, they are not apt to give their pri|&s;oners up; but let it &s;uffice, that what is written can be proved by living and &s;ub&s;tantial witne&s;&s;es. A hand&s;ome room was provided for me, but I believe it is cu&s;tomary for the civilized nations to be more particular in their furniture. I remember an in&s;tance in the Onondago nation, of a family (their names I do not recollect) who&s;e hou&s;e was fa&s;hionably furni&s;h|ed, after the manner of white people; and would further remark, that where the Indians place their confidence or good will, they are very particular, and warmly attached; their uncommon friend&s;hip to an adopted pri&s;oner will prove my a&s;&s;ertion. Oc|ca&s;ionally a remark on the &s;avages of America, is worthy of our attention. If the whole of the In|dians were under religious government, and civili|zed, what a great family of people they mu&s;t be;
<PB N="56" REF="027681_0054_0FD5DAAB7AE42FE8">
although I am of opinion&punc; they could never be brought to live in the manner of the white people, as their con&s;titutions appear to be adapted for the wilderne&s;s; and it has often been noticed, that they decrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> in an old &s;ettled country: but what I mean, is re&s;pecting their moral principles, and man|ner of wor&s;hip: but this will be a work of time, al|though a friendly aid would not be ami&s;s.</P>
<P>After being adopted, by my cou&s;in, a room in his hou&s;e was provided for me; therefore I had to leave my parlor, although I was often a vi&s;itor, and in fact, was, with the other pri&s;oners, treated with great friend&s;hip by the whole of the inhabitants. The town lies on an elbow, much in the manner of New-York, having a hand&s;ome lake in the front, lying &s;outh from the town, and on the north &s;ide, the river which is &s;aid to lead from Michilimachinac, of a large extent, and oppo&s;ite the town middling wide; it runs bye, and empties into the lake, and from thence to the river St. Lawrence, and I imagine lies about 45 leagues from O&s;wegotia, about a north cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Indians do but very little labour in the &s;um|mer, and have dances almo&s;t every day, in a long hou&s;e built for that purpo&s;e; the men dance by them&s;elves in a long ring, as their hou&s;es are lengthy, but not wide. They have a narrow rim, in &s;hape of a drum, with two heads to it and a &s;mall mallet with which one &s;trikes on the head; four men have each two &s;ticks, and &s;trike them together; another one has a hollow gourd with &s;hot or corn in it; he fir&s;t &s;ets his mu&s;ic to play, by giving his gourd three or four &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> quick, with a &s;ong accompanying his time, and then more &s;low, on which the drum &s;ets in, with the four who have &s;ticks, and all &s;trike together; their &s;ong and whole mu&s;ic beats together, which make it not di&s;agreeable, as their dances are very re|gular.
<PB N="57" REF="027681_0055_0FD5DA7C2CD7C838">
The Indians have &s;mall bells around their ancles to make a jingling, and &s;tamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ard on the ground, as a wooden floor would di&s;commode their method of dancing. They have a great number of attitudes and po&s;itions in their whole dance, which la&s;ts &s;ometimes two hours, and from the fir&s;t com|mencement of it until the whole are on the floor, does not exceed fifteen minutes; the women &s;lide on their heels and toes, by forming a ring, and will go round in that manner for a great number of times; they have no other method of dancing, and I think have no in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, but &s;ing merrily, and are very jocular and &s;ociable in their dances.&mdash;There are a few French families in town.</P>
<P>In the fall of the year, all the Indians, men, wo|men and children, except a few old and decrepit per&s;ons, go up the river four, five, and &s;ometimes &s;ix hundred miles, and &s;tay all winter, where they live by hunting, and in the &s;pring return down the river with their peltry, meats, &amp;c. and by what lit|tle grain they rai&s;e, and the profits they get on their furr, with the fi&s;h which they catch in the lake be|fore the town, (which are plenty) all contribute to make them live ea&s;y the whole &s;ummer, and to ap|pearance plentiful, particularly as to bread, as they had a baker in town, and many bought con&s;tantly. The fir&s;t &s;abbath I went to ma&s;s, my cou&s;in dre&s;&s;ed me in a long &s;carlet coat, velvet jacket, and a large cocked hat, all trimmed with broad tin&s;ey lace, with &s;carlet leggons, mocki&s;ons trimmed very gay with ribbons and the like, and a &s;ilver headed &s;word, a ruffled &s;hirt, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I felt quite import|ant through the day. After the forenoon exerci&s;e was over, a white woman came and a&s;ked me in En|gli&s;h, what part of America I lived in when at home. I informed her near Elizabeth-Town, in New-Jer|&s;ey.

Every morning I took a walk by the &s;ide of the river and lake, which gave a beautiful pro&s;pect, being about thirty miles in length, and ten in breadth, and on the point is a &s;mall brea&s;twork built of &s;tone, where their cannon is placed, I &s;uppo&s;e an indulgence from the Engli&s;h. There are in the town a number of bark canoes, which I under&s;tood were built the la&s;t French war; the bark it&s;elf is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">irch, and the in&s;ide is lined with cedar &s;plints about four inches wide, and &s;owed to|gether with the &s;trippings of &s;pruce, and tamarack roots; they fir&s;t boil the roots and then &s;plit them. By pacing the length of &s;ome of the boats, I found them &s;ixty feet; with a proportionable width, and would undoubtedly carry fifty men or more, with provi&s;ions. About a mile from the town, is a &s;mall building on an eminence, with a cro&s;s near it, where they all go once a year in proce&s;&s;ion to wor|&s;hip, in the manner of the Roman Catholics.</P>

New-England, and was gone to Michilimachinac trading. She u&s;ed me very well, and I was accom|modated with a genteel room, a good &s;upper, and liquors: the pri&s;oners all fared very well, and next morning we &s;at out on foot, after breakfa&s;t, and travelled to Montreal. We pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal churches and French &s;ettlements, from the lake of two moun|tai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to Montreal; they were cutting their wheat, which was of a middling &s;ize. The drought was &s;o &s;evere that the gra&s;s appeared to be &s;corched; the land looked like a white loam. About eleven o'clock, we arrived at Montreal, after travelling better than ten miles. I was conducted to Mr. Luke Le Corn's hou&s;e, who treated me to a gla&s;s of good old Madei|ra. Doctor Huntly who has the care of the nun's ho&s;pital, came into Mr. Le Corn's, and recom|mended me to &s;aid place for the recovery of my health, as I was far from being in a &s;ound &s;tate of body. A French gentleman who had a Briti&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ion, and had been taken with General Burgoyne, was al&s;o at Le Corn's, &amp; walked with me to Colonel Campbell's quarters, who had the command, or rather was an agent of the Indian department, and treat|ed me with politene&s;s. Whil&s;t I was at the Colonel's quarters, Alexander Campbell came into the room, and as I had quartered in his hou&s;e at Schenectady, we were acquainted with each other, and then living in Montreal, he obtained permi&s;&s;ion for me to go home with him; and on our arrival, Mrs. Campbell ap|peared rejoiced to &s;ee me, and we all dined together as mutually as formerly. After dining, I took my leave of Mrs. Campbell; Mr. Campbell walked with me to the nun's ho&s;pital; after my arrival, a centinel was placed at the door to keep me from de|&s;erting.

they take in the &s;ick of the town, and are &s;upported that way, and the patient pays according to his abili|ties, from a low to a high price. There are no peo|ple more faithful to their patients; two of them are up at a time the whole night, to give them drink and medicine, according to the directions of the phy&s;icians. Their ho&s;pital is kept very clean, and in warm weather, cool, by &s;prinkling the floor with vinegar, or &s;omething to make it agreeable; the beds are neat, and in two rows, as the hou&s;e is long but not wide, an entry way is between the beds, having green curtains, which is a great help to the eyes of per&s;ons, particularly when weak; each pa|tient has his bed, and is never offered victuals or medicine, before the per&s;on who gives it a&s;ks a ble&s;&s;ing on it. They are con&s;tant in prayer at &s;ix o'clock every morning, and frequent ma&s;s, all which is performed on the bended knees, to appearance, with great devotion; in fact, through all their &s;ecu|lar duties of dome&s;tic life, they appear to invoke the Great Arbiter of the univer&s;e for a ble&s;&s;ing; and what is &s;ingular, among&s;t &s;o many women, and for &s;o long a duration, all is harmony and concord, not &s;o much as a contradiction, which mu&s;t proceed from that regularity of &s;y&s;tem which is kept up among them, both civil and religious. In the evening I was vi&s;ited by Stephen Tuthill, (who formerly lived at Saratoga, he left the Americans in the &s;pring of 1779, and married Major John Graham's &s;i&s;ter) who gave me a bottle of Madeira; indeed I owe a debt of gratitude to &s;everal gentlemen, who frequently paid me their vi&s;its, and were kind and liberal; but would rather &s;uppo&s;e it imprudent to mention their names in this journal, for fear of accident: for not|with&s;tanding I am &s;en&s;ible that in this province there are many &s;incere friends to the cau&s;e of America,

<P>On the 14th, being &s;till unwell, and as there was &s;carcely any one to conver&s;e with, (for what was &s;poken, was chiefly in the French language) I made application to go to the general ho&s;pital, which was granted; and Mr. Jones, ma&s;ter of Provo&s;t, walked with me; we had a &s;ociable conver&s;ation together on the war between England and America. He ap|peared to be a man of &s;en&s;e, and &s;eemed to &s;peak feelingly on the unhappy di&s;pute. On my arrival at the ho&s;pital, I was introduced to Captain Gideon Brown&s;on, an American officer, who was wounded in the foot, having one of his toes &s;hot off, and ele|ven wounds in his body by &s;mall &s;hot; a &s;erjeant being with him from the fame regiment, who had received a ball through the knuckle of his left hand.

The wind blew up ahead towards night, accompa|nied with rain, and they having no apprehen&s;ion of danger, drew their boats on &s;hore, which they turn|ed over and lay under all the night; but it appeared the Indians that day had di&s;covered them, and on &s;eeing an old batteau on a &s;mall i&s;land below, &s;wam to it, and fixed it so as to be able by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that boat to go to the i&s;land where the party was, and ju&s;t as the day broke, landed and fired on the whole as they lay under the boats without any ex|pectation of an enemy being near; they killed the Major, a &s;erjeant, five privates, a little boy, and the

New-York; Captain Brown&s;on was from Vermont, &s;erjeants Weed and Defore&s;t, with &s;even privates who were taken with me, were on board; al&s;o &s;e|ven old men from the Mohawk river, and &s;erjeant Curtis. The officers are the gentlemen who were taken on the fourteen mile i&s;land, and were, before the unhappy cata&s;trophe, quartered at Fort George; they and Major Hopkins, were ever e&s;teemed brave good officers; but it was certainly imprudent to lay in &s;uch a place without a centinel planted; &s;till from what has been before mentioned, they being &s;o &s;ecure in their own minds, pleads for the neglect; yet I hope it will prove a warning for the future, to all per&s;ons who &s;hall ever hear of the circum&s;tance. On board of our ve&s;&s;el was a guard of &s;ixteen men, of what was called Scotch emigrants, of Colonel M'Leans rigiment, the guard was commanded by an en&s;ign named M'Graw. In the &s;aid corps were fifty men who were taken from our army, on the attempt to &s;torm Quebec; the re&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of all nations, all &s;orts, and all &s;izes, (&s;peaking not far from within bounds.) We lay that night before Montreal; &s;ome of the officers &s;lept on the quarter deck, expo&s;ed to the night air, but I went into the hold of the ve&s;&s;el and the ea&s;ie&s;t birth I found, was the coil of a large cable; I laid my&s;elf on that and took &s;ome re&s;t, as our Captain appeared to be one of tho&s;e &s;ort of people who wi&s;h to make a &s;hort affair of conver&s;ation or politene&s;s; for he neither gave us a friendly an&s;wer to a que&s;tion, altho' a&s;ked ever &s;o civilly, nor had the manners to a&s;k a man to his cabbin door, nor to eat or drink with him; and to make &s;hort of my text, he was the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed brute I ever met with, or ever &s;hall.</P>
<P>Early the next morning we weighed anchor, and having a fair wind with a &s;trong current, &s;ailed fa&s;t,
<PB N="66" REF="027681_0064_0FD5DA86C4A4DF90">
and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;mall &s;ettlements, having churches in each &s;ettlement; about three o'clock in the af|ternoon we came to anchor before Sorell, it being about fifteen leagues from Montreal. Our com|mander went on &s;hore, and in one hour returned, weighed anchor and proceeded on our voyage until the &s;etting of the &s;un, when he again came to an|chor at the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th of a &s;mall lake, called Saint Peter.</P>
<P>On the 23d we made &s;ail, with a fine fair breeze, and pa&s;&s;ed the lake which is &s;hoal, except the channel. It was &s;aid, that part of the lake which is under water in the Spring, is mowed in the Summer; every &s;ail on board was &s;et. At eight o'clock, we pa&s;&s;ed a &s;ettlement, named Ma&s;hi&s;h, where the to|ries live, or many of them; it is a &s;mall town, call|ed the tory &s;ettlement, a particular a&s;&s;ylum for wo|men who are from the American &s;tates, and de&s;|titute of a home. By eleven o'clock we pa&s;&s;ed the three rivers, where the tide flows about two feet, although it makes no current up. We proceeded on the whole day, and by &s;ailing in a fine river, the banks and hou&s;es affording a beautiful pro&s;pect, to|gether with &s;everal large top&s;ail merchant ve&s;&s;els which we pa&s;&s;ed, laden with goods, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. from Ireland, chiefly for Montreal, made it more a|greeable, and &s;eemed to elevate at times our di&s;a|greeable &s;ituation. At &s;un-down, the ve&s;&s;el came to anchor, within ten miles of Quebec; the flood ran &s;o &s;trong that no head way to &s;ignify, could be made.</P>
<P>The twenty-fourth, weighed anchor early in the morning, the wind ahead, but beating with a &s;trong ebb, we anchored before Quebec at ten o'clock in the morning, it being &s;ixty leagues from Montreal. The common ebbing and flowing of the tide at this
<PB N="67" REF="027681_0065_0FD5DA8539401CD8">
place, is ten feet perpendicular, and the &s;pring tides, often fifteen. The current runs with great force, both in the flood and ebb, and often in the winter fails of freezing acro&s;s. The river is narrower at Quebec, than in any place from the mouth to Mon|treal, which occa&s;ions the tide to run with more ve|locity at Quebec, than in any other part of the river, although there is a great current from Quebec to Newfoundland in particular. In about an hour's time after fir&s;t coming to anchor, we hauled along &s;ide of a large letter of marque&punc; mounting twenty-&s;ix guns, named the Brilliant; &s;ome gentlemen who were on board of the &s;hip, &s;ent us four bottles of porter. There were thirty pieces of cannon with carriages, hoi&s;ted out of the Brilliant, and put on board of the Snow. That night we &s;till &s;uffered more than formerly, as there was no place to lie on but tho&s;e carriages and guns; however, on the next day, a long boat came along &s;ide and took us all from our plea&s;ant Captain, and we were put on board of a &s;hip, named the York, mounting twenty-&s;ix guns, commanded by Richard Brewer, an En|gli&s;h gentleman, who formerly &s;ailed out of South-Carolina, for a gentleman (I think) by the name of Cox. Captain Brewer and the fir&s;t mate being on &s;hore, the &s;hip was then under the command of a Mr. John&s;on, &s;econd mate, who confined us all down in the hold of the ve&s;&s;el, in the gun room; there were twenty-one of us: the dead lights were chained and locked up, which made our &s;ituation di&s;agreeable, as it was dark, and we could not &s;tand &s;trait up, by rea&s;on of the deck being &s;o low. How|ever, two of the pri&s;oners were admitted on deck at a time, as our guard was put on board to keep us &s;afe; we had to go up through a &s;mall &s;cuttle, which would not admit more than one per&s;on to go up at a
<PB N="68" REF="027681_0066_0FD5DA83804EA4D0">
time, and on deck &s;tood a brave &s;oldier, with a fixed bayonet, to attend on the manoeuvring of the pri|&s;oners who went on deck. It was truly laughable to &s;ee &s;ixteen &s;oldiers under arms on deck, to guard twenty-one poor di&s;armed pri&s;oners, and the &s;hip's crew contained not much &s;hort of one hundred men; however, as we were men of importance, &s;afety was nece&s;&s;ary, and the guard continued on board during our &s;tay. About &s;un-&s;et, Captain Brewer came on board, and &s;ent for tho&s;e who were officers when taken pri&s;oners, and invited the whole into his cabbin, where we remained during our &s;tay on board, and received the polite&s;t treatment I ever met with in the whole of my captivity, as we were treat|ed with the be&s;t of diet, and drink of every kind; the Captain frequently had other Captains of ve&s;&s;els to dine and &s;up with him, and we were &s;harers in his entertainments; in a word, no men could be better u&s;ed; and the other pri&s;oners al&s;o experienced the bounty of that good man. In ju&s;tice to the fir&s;t mate, Mr. Colereach, Mr. John&s;on &s;econd mate, and the doctor, who&s;e name is Mua, I mu&s;t &s;ay that they were friendly, kind-hearted men; in fact it &s;ometimes ap|peared that we were not pri&s;oners as there was &s;o much friend&s;hip from the officers and &s;hips crew to the pri&s;oners as will never be era&s;ed. The charac|ter of John&s;on, the &s;econd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, was droll and &s;ingu|lar; he is a New-England man, and would walk the deck &s;ometimes for an hour, the whole time praying to his Maker, &s;o loud that he could be heard in any part of the &s;hip, and &s;eemed to be in great earne&s;t, a&s;king forgivene&s;s of his &s;ins; and penetential expre&s;|&s;ions appeared to flow from his lips with a &s;incere contrition of heart; but in the mid&s;t of the&s;e ejacula|tions, if he &s;aw a &s;ailor doing any thing ami&s;s, e&s;peci|ally on the yard arm or round top, he would &s;wear at
<PB N="69" REF="027681_0067_0FD5DA6F6FF7B960">
him with &s;uch vehemence, that he would appear to damn him, the yard arm, round top, ma&s;ts, &s;hip and crew, and the next minute praying and a&s;king forgivene&s;s for all his &s;ins; in &s;hort, he was a very good natured man, but an old &s;eaman, and was &s;o addicted to &s;wearing, that he often told me he did not know when he &s;wore: he put me in mind of a man named Tom Pope, who would u&s;e by turns ill lan|guage, and then a&s;ked forgivene&s;s, and &s;aid he mu&s;t pay as he went on. However, relative to poor John|&s;on, I have rea&s;on to believe the man was hear|tily &s;orry for his allowing him&s;elf in &s;uch lan|guage; but it &s;eems the &s;ailors were rather remi&s;s in obeying his commands, until he made u&s;e of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, on purpo&s;e to make their merriment. He often lamented to me, that it was his lot to be a &s;eaman on account of the practice which generally prevails among that cla&s;s of men, in u&s;ing profane language, and &s;aid, that when he was young, he had no fear of God before his eyes, and became one of the profane&s;t wretches that ever exi&s;ted, but then &s;eemed to lament his former and pre&s;ent conduct: particularly his having taken God's name in vain; but being &s;o addicted to the practice, it &s;eemed an impo&s;&s;ibility to leave it off, although he &s;aid it was his intention to quit the &s;ea-faring bu&s;ine&s;s, and take &s;ome other calling by rea&s;on of the habit. The officers who dined and &s;upped on board the York, are named Drew, Scott and Gray; they were Cap|tain's of large &s;hips; I think Drew commanded a Frigate, and was an acting commodore; they were much of gentlemen, and I &s;hould be very happy if either of them &s;hould ever go into the United States, that they might be treated with cordiality for their politene&s;s to the pri&s;oners, as al&s;o the mates and doctor of the &s;hip York.

<P>Tue&s;day 7th.&mdash;Mr. Miles Prenti&s;s, the Provo&s;t ma&s;ter in Quebec, came on board with orders for us to leave the &s;hip and go on &s;hore; on which we made ready, and embarked on board a large long boat, and landed in the town with our guard, and were march|ed to the jail, being obliged to carry our bedding and &s;pare clothes on our backs through the town, and on our arrival at our place of confinement, had a room for the officers adjoining where the other pri&s;oners who accompanied us were put.

<P>We are informed, that in October, Lieut. Col. Statia and Captain John Wood, were brought from Niagara and confined in Chamblee. The Colonel was taken at Cherry Valley, by the Indians, where a number of our troops, and the inhabitants, were inhumanly murdered; among whom were Colonel Alden, and Mrs. Dunlap, wife to the Rev. Mr. Dunlap, an aged and worthy lady. But the in|&s;tance (from information) of Capt. Wood, is truly remarkable.

<P>CEYLON, a large i&s;land in the Ea&s;t-Indies, ly|ing between 78 and 82 degrees of ea&s;t longitude, and between 6 and 10 north latitude, being 250 miles in length, and 195 in breadth. In general the air is good, and the country is full of mountains; there are plea&s;ant valleys, but the mountains are ve|ry high and barren. It is particularly remarkable for its plenty of cinnamon, which is all in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutch, who drove out the Portugue&s;e and u|&s;urped the dominion of the country. The i&s;land is &s;ituated in the Indian Sea, near the &s;outhea&s;t coa&s;t of the continent of the hither India. The Dutch are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the &s;ea coa&s;t, and have &s;hut up the king in the middle of the i&s;land, who re&s;ides at his capital city, of Candy. There are, in &s;ome places, rich mines, from whence are got rubies, &s;apphires, topazes, and cats eyes; the i&s;land abounds with all kinds of cattle, as in other parts of India: elephants are of the &s;ame. They have very dangerous &s;er|pents and ants, which do a great deal of mi&s;chief. The mo&s;t remarkable tree in this i&s;land, is called the Tallipot, one of who&s;e leaves will cover ten men and keep them from rain; they are very light and travellers carry them from place to place and keep them for tents. The inhabitants are divided into &s;everal tribes, from the nobleman down to the ma|ker of matts, and all the children follow the &s;ame call|ing as their father's; nor is it lawful to marry into any other tribe. They have each a particular mark in their dre&s;s. Their religion is idolatry, and though they acknowledge a Supreme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">od, they wor&s;hip in|ferior beings; among the&s;e are the &s;un and moon; their pagods and images are very numerous, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

A few reflections on matters of a &s;erious nature, by turns, will not be ami&s;s, as I am fully per&s;uaded of the immortality of the &s;oul, and that an account mu&s;t be rendered to our Great Lord and Ma&s;ter, of my &s;teward&s;hip.&mdash;The fir&s;t and &s;everal remarks are chiefly borrowed from Antoninus, a Roman Empe|ror, and are &s;tiled the Meditations of Antoninus the pious&mdash;He &s;ays, "Let me thus &s;ay to my&s;elf every morning, that I may in every re&s;pect act as one a|ware that I may in a &s;hort time depart out of life, and that if I &s;hould have to do with &s;ome intermed|dler in other men's affairs, with an ungrateful, or in&s;olent, a crafty, an envious, or an un&s;ociable, &s;elfi&s;h man, the&s;e bad qualities have befallen him through ignorance of what things are really good or evil, and that by a con&s;tant guard over my&s;elf, I cannot be hurt by any of them, &s;ince none of them can involve me in any thing di&s;honorable or deformed.</P>

<P>The city of Quebec, &s;tands on an elbow, but the large&s;t &s;ide of the town is on the river St. Lawrence, in north latitude 47 35. three hundred miles north|we&s;t of Bo&s;ton, and five hundred and fifty nine miles from New-York. It was attempted by the Engli&s;h in the reign of Queen Ann, but it being in a late &s;ea|&s;on of the year, and wanting good pilots, they failed in their attempt, by which means &s;ome tran&s;ports and &s;everal hundred &s;oldiers were lo&s;t. There are two towns, the Upper and Lower, and I judge it to be about half as large as New-York.

Haldiman is fortifying; and I am informed he is un|dermining the ground to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance out of the town, by which means large quantities of powder may be put in order to blow up an army, in ca&s;e of an attempt to &s;torm, and the garri&s;on will &s;u&s;tain no harm: it can contain ten thou&s;and men and provi&s;ions for &s;even years&mdash;So much for Briti&s;h information.

MADAGASCAR, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the large&s;t i&s;land in the world, &s;ituated between 43 and 51 de|grees of ea&s;t longitude, and between 12 and 26 de|grees of &s;outh latitude, 300 miles &s;outhea&s;t of the continent of Africa, and is about one thou&s;and miles in length, from north to &s;outh, and generally be|tween two and three hundred miles broad: it a|bounds in cattle, fi&s;h, fowl, and all manner of animals and vegetables that are to be found on the continent of Africa. There are a great variety of hills and valleys, and is well watered with rivers and &s;prings; nor does there want for good harbours: and yet, not any European nation has thought it worth while to plant colonies there, it producing no merchandize that will bear the ex|pence of &s;o long a voyage, except negroes, which are purcha&s;ed there as well as on the continent. There are al&s;o white men, and a tawny generation upon the coa&s;t, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;cended, from the Arabs, from their language and religious rites, having a mixture of Mahometani&s;m, Judai&s;m, and Pagani&s;m; but they have no mo&s;ques or tem|ples, or any &s;tated wor&s;hip. The country is divided among a great many petter &s;overeigns, to whom the &s;eamen that touch there, give the title of kings and princes, who, making war on each other as they do on the continent, &s;ell the pri&s;oners for &s;laves to the &s;hipping which call there, taking clothing, uten&s;ils, and other nece&s;&s;aries in return. European pirates formerly frequently had their &s;tation in the harbours of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> i&s;land, among&s;t whom was Avery, &s;o much talked of a number of years ago, and to &s;uppre&s;s whom five Engli&s;h men of war were &s;ent thither; but the pirates &s;eemed to be as powerful as any of the princes of Madaga&s;car, and bid defiance to their enemies who came to attack them by &s;ea or land.

It was conjectured the pirates would have formed a petty &s;tate in this i&s;land, having &s;ix or &s;even &s;hips with them, on the northea&s;t part of Madaga&s;car, whither they u&s;ed to carry in the prizes they made in the Indian Seas, and fortified the avenues to the harbour where they &s;ecured them.

<P>JERUSALEM, an ancient and famous town in A&s;ia. The old city being ruined, the Emperor A|drian built a new city near the ruins of ancient Jeru|&s;alem; it was taken by the Per&s;ians in 614, and by the Siracens in 636; and in 1099, it was retaken by the Latins, who founded a new kingdom, which la&s;ted eighty-eight years, under nine kings. Saladin, king of Egypt and Syria, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in 1187; the Turks drove away the Siracens in 1227, and have kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it ever &s;ince; they call it Eleons, that is, the Holy City. It is now inhabited by Turks, Arabs, Jews and Chri&s;tians. It &s;tands on a high rock, with &s;teep a&s;cents on every &s;ide, except the north; it is &s;urrounded with valleys, encompa&s;&s;ed

The only thing which renders it con&s;iderable, is the great re|&s;ort of pilgrims. The church of the holy &s;epulchre, which the pilgrims come to vi&s;it, is a large &s;tructure, with a round nave, which has no light but what comes through the top; the dome is covered with lead on the out&s;ide, and with cedar within. The opening of the dome is clo&s;ed with wire, to hinder the birds from coming into the church; in the mid|dle of the nave, and directly under the opening of the dome, is the holy &s;epulchre, which is placed in a chapel who&s;e door is three feet high and two feet broad, and is &s;o &s;mall that it will hold but three per|&s;ons, on their knees, at once; at the entrance on the right hand, is the place where the body of our Sa|viour was laid; the table which he was laid on at fir&s;t, is two feet and an half from the pavement, which is now covered with white marble, becau&s;e the Chri&s;tians who came to view it were all for car|rying away a &s;mall bit. This chapel is cut out of the rock, and there are three holes in the roof to let out the &s;moke of the lamps, which are forty-four in number, and always kept burning; the whole is covered with white marble, both within and without, and on the out&s;ide, there are ten fine co|lumns of the &s;ame; it is covered with a platform, the middle of which is exactly above the three holes, and forms a &s;mall dome &s;ix feet in heighth, covered with lead and &s;upported with twelve columns of por|phyry, placed by pairs on the platform, and &s;o ma|king &s;ix arches, having three lamps under each.

<P>We are informed that Major Carleton, with &s;ix hundred men and two hundred Indians, has gone into the frontiers of the &s;tates, and that Colonel But|ler is gone to Fort Stanwix, or to the Mohawk river.

They then pro|ceeded to Fort George, and &s;ome of the Indians making their appearance, forty-eight of the garri&s;on &s;allied out, including &s;ix officers, and fell in an am|bu&s;h; twenty-four were killed and &s;calped, &s;eventeen wounded and taken pri&s;oners, and &s;even made their e&s;cape.

<P><HI>From the Spectator.</HI>&mdash;A &s;tate of temperence, &s;o|briety and ju&s;tice, without devotion, is a cold, life|le&s;s, in&s;ipid condition of virtue, and is rather to be &s;tiled philo&s;ophy than religion. Devotion opens the mind to great conceptions, and fills it with more &s;ub|lime ideas than any that are to be met with in the mo&s;t exalted &s;cience, and at the &s;ame time warms and agitates the &s;oul more than &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure. It has been ob&s;erved by &s;ome writers, that man is more di&s;tingui&s;hed from the animal world, by de|votion, than by rea&s;on; as &s;everal brute creatures di&s;cover in their actions &s;omething like a faint glim|mering of rea&s;on, though they betray in no &s;ingle circum&s;tance of their behaviour any thing that bears affinity to devotion; it is certain the propen&s;ity of the mind to religious wor&s;hip, the natural tendency of the &s;oul to fly to &s;ome &s;uperior being for &s;uccor

The tide not being high enough, we were obliged to &s;tay on board in a very uncom|fortable &s;ituation, the night being extremely cold;
<PB N="120" REF="027681_0118_0FD5DB0AF714E808">
and the next morning, the tide &s;till not ri&s;ing high enough, be&s;ides being hard frozen up with ice, we received orders to return back again to our old quarters, the provo&s;t: and carriols being provided for the officers (as it was good &s;ledding) we rode in &s;tate to Mr. Ritchey's, our old taylor, and drank a gla&s;s of wine; and from thence to the old father of the faithful, Miles Prenti&s;s, where we had an ex|cellent Dinner and plenty of wine, with a jovial frolic, and back to our old quarters, as rich as the Mogul of Indo&s;tan, to think we had been to the ri|ver and back again, which was near one hundred rods.</P>
<P>2d&mdash;We had a vi&s;it from Col. Peters, Capt. M'Fall, Capt. Sherwood, and Capt. Jones, and had a long &s;tory to tell of our ye&s;terday's journey and voyage.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, 5th.&mdash;We &s;eem to re&s;ume our former times: here is a grunt, and there a complaint of back-ache, head-ache, and a great many aches. A French regular major was brought to town ye&s;ter|day. Mr. Prenti&s;s had a niece named Frances, a genteel young lady, married to an old fellow, named Thomp&s;on.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, 12th.&mdash;A poor unfortunate man, who belonged to the artillery, &s;hot him&s;elf (&s;uppo&s;ed wil|fully) ye&s;terday. I have lent the pri&s;oners a con&s;i|derable &s;um of money; be&s;ides, never has a week, I imagine, pa&s;&s;ed, but I have &s;ent them vegetables, tobacco, and &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as po&s;&s;ibly could be &s;pared by me, and for which I now &s;tand accounta|ble to government and private gentlemen, for mo|nies borrowed, which the pri&s;oners have pledged them&s;elves to be re&s;pon&s;ible to each other for. Capt. Brown&s;on and Lieutenant Dunning, in particular, have been liberal to the pri&s;oners, there being &s;ome

confined from the regiment to which they belonged, and from the other corps of the American armies.</P>
<P>December 29. The weather has been exceed|ingly cold. The main river is &s;hut up, which, from information, has not happened in &s;even years.</P>
<P>January 12, 1781. This afternoon &s;ome &s;leighs, or (as the French call them) carriols, came and took the pri&s;oners' baggage, and all the pri&s;oners, except the officers, to go on to the I&s;le of Orleans.</P>
<P>January 13. This morning &s;ome &s;leighs came for us, with Canadians to drive us; we left our room about nine o'clock, and pa&s;&s;ed about two miles on the ice, to the i&s;le of Orleans, where we over|took the pri&s;oners who left the provo&s;t ye&s;terday; they are all ordered to go on board a &s;hip called the Cancer, at Patrick's Hole. The roads being badly beaten, and having but one hor&s;e to our carriol, and three on board, renders the travelling very dull. About twelve o'clock we arrived at a pari&s;h called Saint Lawrence, or as the French pronounce it, Cileroy, where we halted for about an hour, and had a &s;ight of the Canadian hou&s;es, which look well on the out&s;ide, but within are not altogether &s;o comely. We next went to St. John's, where we re&s;ted again; and after leaving the village of Cile|roy, &s;carcely &s;aw a hou&s;e until we came to the &s;et|tlement of St. John's; indeed, from the be&s;t in|formation I can gather, the whole province of Ca|nada is &s;ettled in village pari&s;hes, and near the churches are generally the main part of the congre|gation, or within the compa&s;s of a mile and an half, or thereabouts, each way, although &s;cattering hou&s;es are to be &s;een the whole di&s;tance on the road; but it is certain they &s;ettle thicker in pari&s;hes, than in the &s;tates, and their hou&s;es make not an unre&s;pectable appearance con&s;idering the people are all hard la|borers,
<PB N="122" REF="027681_0120_0FD5DB45B75E8F80">
and I believe the whole province are under tenantable &s;eniors, or large land-holders, who are thus &s;tiled, although their taxes are very light. The people appeared to &s;hew every mark of kind|ne&s;s to us who were pri&s;oners; but our not being able to &s;peak a word of French made it &s;ingular to us, and likely to them, as the Engli&s;h who are livers in the province of Canada, can &s;peak French to a proverb. We did not tarry long at this place be|fore &s;etting out, and the road being heavy, made it dark before our arrival at St. Francis (the French &s;pell it <HI>Francois</HI>) a hou&s;e in a pari&s;h the farthe&s;t end of the I&s;le of Orleans, twenty &s;even miles, or nine leagues, from Quebec. We all lodged, drivers and pri&s;oners, in one hou&s;e together, where, for the fir&s;t, we &s;aw and eat a &s;upper of their &s;oup, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sabbath, 14th. Lieut. Dunning and my&s;elf were quartered in a hou&s;e, the owner of which was named Mu&s;o. Our new &s;ituation, not being able to hold any kind of conver&s;ation with the inhabitants, toge|ther with the inten&s;e coldne&s;s of the weather (the like all of us confe&s;&s;ed never to have beheld or felt before) does not &s;eem to alter our comfort any great for the better, as it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to go far from the hou&s;e; but there is this to &s;ay, we are not under lock and key.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, January 25. The fir&s;t of receiving any provi&s;ions from government, and that in part. The French or Canadians, have to every hou&s;e a &s;tove, which is con&s;tantly kept with a good fire in the winter, and the heat of the &s;tove again&s;t the gla&s;s windows, forms a contra&s;t between heat and cold; for the in&s;ide of the pane being kept warm, and the fro&s;t on the out&s;ide, in &s;uch extreme cold nights as are in this country, forms an ice on the pane in the morning nearly double the thickne&s;s of
<PB N="123" REF="027681_0121_0FD5DAE0ABC23988">
the gla&s;s; and their rule to know in the morning the degree of cold on the night pa&s;t, is by the thick|ne&s;s of the ice on the gla&s;s windows of their &s;tove room; and the keene&s;t and cleare&s;t nights will form the greate&s;t ice, and particles which will appear loo&s;e on the out&s;ide of the ice, exactly re&s;embling &s;now.</P>
<P>On the 17th, Capt. M'Fall, who is paroled from Bo&s;ton, arrived at the next hou&s;e to live. I have begun to endeavor, as far as my abilities will admit, to gain what knowledge I can in &s;peaking the French language, and am of opinion, were there no Eng|li&s;h to be &s;poken among the Engli&s;h officers and my brother pri&s;oners, I could readily gain a knowledge of the language, as I have a dictionary and gram|mar; but it is &s;aid the Canadians &s;peak very impro|per, although not quite &s;o bad as a Mr. Per&s;ons, whom I found in this place, on parole from Bo&s;ton, for he &s;peaks &s;ix words of Engli&s;h and one of French; although he has undertaken to learn us the language. We have for our commander a Capt. M'Kenno, a Scotchman, who is va&s;tly particular, as we mu&s;t be in our quarters every evening by nine o'clock; it &s;hews he is a man of authority.</P>
<P>February 13. David Gri&s;wold, from the &s;hip Cancer, came to live with and cook for Mr. Dun|ning and my&s;elf, and informs us that the pri&s;oners on board of &s;aid &s;hip &s;uffer very much, particularly by &s;ickne&s;s; two that were &s;eamen are dead.</P>

<P><PB N="124" REF="027681_0122_0FD5DAEFC816FBE0">
February 24. The people from what I can learn, are making preparations for a great fea&s;t of three days, previous to Lent Sabbath.</P>
<P>25th. This morning the French have begun their fea&s;t; it is &s;tiled <HI>monja groe,</HI> or great fea&s;t: they vi&s;it each other and appear very generous, which is a common characteri&s;tic of the inhabitants, generally &s;peaking.</P>
<P>Monday morning, 26th. The inhabitants, from the olde&s;t to the younge&s;t, vi&s;it one another, and every hou&s;e is kept open for the reception of friends; they have their dances promi&s;cuou&s;ly, without the formality of young people a&s;&s;embling by them&s;elves: the father, mother, &s;on and daughter, will be in a room and dance with a great degree of harmony; although the young people will mo&s;t commonly have a little a&s;&s;embly by them&s;elves in the after part of the day; but from the nature of their rejoicings, they are taught to regard this part as rather a reli|gious conviviality&punc; than for the mere form of what is vulgarly termed frolicking.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, 27th. This day has fini&s;hed the great fea&s;ting among the French, for this part of the cere|mony, and is the greate&s;t in the year. How far their &s;uper&s;titions may be thought by tho&s;e of a dif|ferent per&s;ua&s;ion, to extend, is unknown to me; but I can &s;ay that nothing has tran&s;pired in the eye of my ob&s;ervation, which I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e ought to be condemned with that rancor which many are plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e towards the Roman Catholics; although I believe they carry many of their per|formances to too great a length of enthu&s;ia&s;m; not only temporal but &s;piritual: particularly in this pro|vince, as the inhabitants, e&s;pecially the males, are de&s;titute of education, and of con&s;equence are va&s;tly ignorant, &s;peaking within bounds from every in|formation

<P>The weather is cold, and beyond any conception I had ever formed; for being formerly in Albany, Schenectady, and Fort Stanwix, I thought I had felt &s;evere weather, but this is as far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Al|bany, as Albany (in my opinion) does in a common run of weather, Philadelphia, or &s;till further &s;outh|ward. The drifts of &s;now around hou&s;es, barns, &amp;c. are in &s;ome places from &s;ix to twelve feet deep, and on a common level five feet. Their cattle of every kind are kept in clo&s;e hou&s;es, and water is carried to them, from the hor&s;e down to the &s;heep. The cattle are fed on &s;traw, made from wheat, oats, barley, and pea vines, and what I have &s;een, a mere trifle of hay is in their barns, to what is made u&s;e of in the States. The men appear to &s;moke a great deal, and live ea&s;y in the winter.</P>
<P>Saturday, March 10. This evening, about ele|ven o'clock, Capt. M'Kenno, our commandant, Capt. Frazier, and a Lieut. Robert&s;on, came to my quarters and I was awaked from &s;leep, and heard the following important information:&mdash;"That four gentlemen had that day paid Capt. M'Kenno a vi&s;it, and &s;aid that the day before they left Quebec they dined with general Haldiman, who had ever appear-to keep news clo&s;e to him&s;elf, but then &s;aid he had
<PB N="126" REF="027681_0124_0FD5DAF5ACC7FD40">
&s;traight accounts from New-York, that two Ame|rican generals, thirty colonels, and four thou&s;and of the be&s;t of General Wa&s;hington's army, had re|volted and joined Sir Henry Clinton, and that the remaining part of the American army would undoubt|edly follow the example&mdash;that the French, finding the &s;ituation of the Americans, had taken Bo&s;ton in the name of the French king, until the debt due from America to France &s;hould be paid." Captain M'Kenno advi&s;ed us immediately to write to Gene|ral Haldiman for protection, under a promi&s;e of be|coming faithful &s;ubjects to the crown of Great-Bri|tain; he was however fearful whether we &s;hould receive pardon; he &s;eemed to feel for Capt. Brown|&s;on, on account of his being an aged and venerable looking man, that he &s;hould be hung; but did not &s;eem &s;o much to lament the &s;ate of Smith, Dunning, and my&s;elf. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that after the gentlemen were gone I had very &s;erious reflections on the re|port; and its being handed to me in &s;uch a manner, &amp; at a late hour of the night, with the reflection of the continental money being near or quite dead, added to the gloom of the pro&s;pect; and I can truly &s;ay, that if ever I felt for my country, it was at this cri&s;is; and it would &s;well a volume to mention the number of different opinions and reflections which pre&s;ented them&s;elves to view on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, March 13. I am informed Serjeant Defore&s;t died on board the &s;hip Cancer, on the 15th of February. Ho&s;ea M'Farland and Mo&s;es Bee|dle died about the fir&s;t of this month; and an old man by the name of Odle Squire is al&s;o dead:</P>
<P>My brother officers and my&s;elf have had a confer|ence on the late news, which the Quebec papers teem with a confirmation of, and which is in every Canadian's mouth; but we agree it cannot be true,

and to the honor of Capt. Brown&s;on, he appears to &s;uppo&s;e it a mere bubble of noi&s;e without founda|tion; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have my fears that &s;ome|thing uncommon has turned up.</P>
<P>April 8. Raw, cold, windy day from northea&s;t; the wind generally blows up or down the River St. Lawrance, which &s;ets near a northea&s;t cour&s;e. The inhabitants from each hou&s;e took this day &s;ome green hemlock boughs to ma&s;s with them, which receives &s;everal ceremonies, by being &s;prinkled with holy water, and &s;uch manner of con&s;ecration as is in their church di&s;cipline, which I hope to be more able to explain; let it &s;uffice, that the u&s;e of tho&s;e boughs are to take to their re&s;pective homes, where they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> generally fixed over head to the beam of the floor, or the like places, which are handy to reach in ca&s;e of a thunder &s;torm, as the boughs are prepared and made holy according to their ideas, they fling a twig of the hemlock into the fire in ca&s;e of a heavy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of thunder, and the &s;moke of the twig will keep the lightening from &s;triking the hou&s;e, as they &s;ay it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> holy, and that thunder is of the Devil's permi&s;&s;ion, and cannot &s;trike or harm any thing that is made ho|ly by their church.</P>
<P>April 13. The wind hard at N. E. and &s;now all la&s;t night and to day. The young women went la&s;t night to ma&s;s; two of them &s;et in the church toge|ther for one hour, and then are relieved by two more&punc; the others &s;tay in the par&s;on's hou&s;e, and thus continue the night through. They hold it in commemoration of the evening on which our Sa|viour was betrayed.</P>
<P>April 14. We mea&s;ured the depth of the &s;now in the woods to-day, and find it three feet and an half on a level. Capt. M'Fall, the Captain of the mili|tia, and my&s;elf, went to Cileroy after provi&s;ions, as
<PB N="128" REF="027681_0126_0FD5DADA11481280">
we have forty four days due, and have lived the whole time on the inhabitants, and are al&s;o denied any further &s;upply in money from government. We dined with &s;ome German officers, who treated us with a great degree of politene&s;s: they are bil|leted at &s;aid place with about one hundred men.</P>
<P>26th. The river St. Lawrance appo&s;ite where we live, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about five miles in width, and the &s;hip channel is near this &s;hore. Oppo&s;ite to us, about two miles from the main land, is an i&s;land called Madam, where the gee&s;e on their way to Newfoundland and the Bay of Hud&s;on &s;top to re&s;t, and among &s;everal other i&s;lands in the river. We went in company with Capt. M'Fall la&s;t evening on to &s;aid i&s;land to hunt gee&s;e; but they appeared to know them&s;elves in danger by coming near &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> when the tide was up; for, as I before ob&s;erved, the tide ebbs and flows a great heighth, and the banks are of a gradual &s;lope, &s;o that it leaves almo&s;t or quite half a mile between high and low water marks; high water would come within &s;mall gun-&s;hot of the woods, and let it be ever &s;o dark, windy and rough, the gee&s;e would keep a certain di&s;tance from &s;hore round the whole i&s;land, which is at lea&s;t two miles long, &s;o that they were quite out of gun-&s;hot, and at low water they would feed on the &s;hore in fair &s;ight of us, but at too great a di&s;tance to touch them, and of con&s;equence we re|turned as we went.</P>
<P>April 29. The method of the people of this country re&s;pecting the &s;ick, is as follows&mdash;When the mini&s;ter is &s;ent for to vi&s;it a &s;ick per&s;on (particularly if the patient is &s;uppo&s;ed to be dangerous) the prie&s;t dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in a white &s;urplice and is accompanied by one of the pari&s;h, who carries a &s;mall bell which is rung oppo&s;ite every hou&s;e the mini&s;ter pa&s;&s;es, on
<PB N="129" REF="027681_0127_0FD5DB47D426EB98">
which the whole family immediately turn out of doors and fall on their knees to prayer, with a &s;eem|ing devotion full of fervency for the recovery of the per&s;on he is vi&s;iting.</P>
<P>May 1. The ice at Quebec is &s;uppo&s;ed to be broken up, as the river is very full of large cakes which float over a reef of rocks the other &s;ide of the I&s;le of Madam, and make a clattering &s;ound, like a wheeled carriage going over a quantity of &s;tones with great force.</P>
<P>5th. The fir&s;t &s;wallow that has been &s;een, and is &s;omething remarkable too, as there is a great deal of &s;now on the ground in banks, though the fields are mo&s;tly clear. A few people have begun to &s;ow their wheat.</P>
<P>May 10. The wind has blown hard from the northea&s;t for &s;everal days, and the &s;now banks de|crea&s;e but &s;low. The inhabitants allow the &s;pring to be later than common. I computed the tide this morning to ri&s;e eighteen feet perpendicular, and &s;ome of the gentlemen &s;uppo&s;ed near or quite twen|ty. A large &s;now bank that lies fair to the &s;un, we to day mea&s;ured, and find it five feet deep; but it has been a drift that was probably fifteen feet deep in the greate&s;t depth of winter.</P>
<P>The farmers are generally &s;owing their wheat, which is done in a manner uncommon in the Ame|rican States. The land in this country is level and clear of &s;tone, and all the plows that have come un|der my notice, have wheels to them, and of con&s;e|quence would be u&s;ele&s;s in &s;tony ground; they guage their plows to cut about four inches deep, and lay their furrows from &s;even to nine inches wide, and turn the turf over as flat as po&s;&s;ibly can be done, &s;o that the fields appear exceeding level. The plowing I am informed is done in the month of Oc|tober
<PB N="130" REF="027681_0128_0FD5DB3578FC9B98">
and lays until &s;pring, when they &s;ow their wheat without further manuring of any kind, and after the wheat is &s;own, they have a light three-&s;quare wooden-tooth harrow, much of the &s;ize of the American corn harrow, and is quite ea&s;y for the draught of one hor&s;e only, and with this they go the &s;ame way the ground is laid over, and &s;carcely more than twice in a place; they make no preten|&s;ions to cro&s;s-harrowing; indeed from what I can &s;ee in their way of putting their &s;eed in the ground, it is a &s;trife who &s;hall &s;ow and cover the mo&s;t bu&s;hels in a day, and not who &s;hall do it be&s;t. I have walk|ed over their fallows and find a great deal of their wheat entirely uncovered. They will &s;ow from twenty to forty bu&s;hels, and I judge they do not &s;ow more than a bu&s;hel to an acre. The land is of a light gravelly marl, and I think would produce &s;pontaneou&s;ly were it put under good cultivation. Some have plowed &s;word ground over this &s;pring, in order to &s;ow.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, May 17. The people have done &s;eeding their ground. A brig pa&s;&s;ed up the river from England; Capt. M'Kenno, and Capt. M'Fall went on board, and brought the news that &s;ome of the Dutch provinces had declared war a|gain&s;t England, and al&s;o, that the outward bound fleets to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies are taken from the Engli&s;h by the French and Spaniards</P>
<P>Monday, 21. The people in this country appear to go one-third of their time to public wor&s;hip; they have had to day a proce&s;&s;ion. In the fir&s;t place they held their ma&s;s, and the proce&s;&s;ion was performed by a young man's going foremo&s;t carrying a cro&s;s, which was extended &s;ome di&s;tance in the air (I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e twelve or fifteen feet) on a pole, and the cro&s;s was beautifully ornamented; the prie&s;t
<PB N="131" REF="027681_0129_0FD5DB0DACB9EBB0">
next followed, and after him the men and women they walked quite flow, with an apparent devotion, until they arrived at a &s;mall chapel about half a mile from the church, and marched round &s;aid chapel, the prie&s;t continuing a con&s;tant ceremony in a &s;inging tone, and then returned to the church as they came.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, 23. The &s;ame ceremonies that were performed on the 21&s;t, were continued ye&s;terday and to-day; but I cannot learn what part of our Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion they celebrate, and am very much clogged in being a hi&s;torian of this province, and what is written proceeds from my own amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Captain M'Fall has received a letter from Col&punc; Peters, who mentions that commi&s;&s;ioners are ar|rived at the I&s;le of Aux Noix, on Lake Champlain, from the United States of America, to negociate an exchange of pri&s;oners; that the Portugue&s;e are go|ing to war again&s;t England; that the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia has demanded her &s;hipping, with the damages done to them, from the Engli&s;h; that the French had left Rhode-I&s;land and landed at Che&s;apeake Bay, and that the Engli&s;h fleet from New-York had pur|&s;ued them, and de&s;troyed the whole French fleet; that Mr. Arnold, &s;upported by General Phillips, had lately a battle in Virginia&mdash;General Sumpter is wounded, and fifteen hundred is killed and taken of the French and Americans, and tho&s;e who are left are gone home to hoe their tobacco.</P>
<P>May 31. The apple-trees begin to bloom.&mdash;There has not been any rain &s;ince the &s;now left the ground.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, June 5. The wind is raw and cold, from the northea&s;t. This evening the French fin|i&s;h, by appointment, their ten days praying for rain; they a&s;&s;embled about &s;un-&s;et every day around the &s;mall chapel, and all kneeled to prayer and &s;ung a
<PB N="132" REF="027681_0130_0FD5DB4E6E5079D0">
p&s;alm; indeed for three days pa&s;t they have kept a very &s;olemn <HI>fait,</HI> as it is termed in French, or have held ma&s;s every day, which, from what I can learn, is to commemorate the three days our Saviour lay in the earth. The tenth day after he aro&s;e, will be the greate&s;t day they can celebrate, as on that day, they hold, he a&s;cended up to Heaven.</P>
<P>Capt. M'Kenno has been to Quebec, and re|turned with the di&s;agreeable news that the commi&s;|&s;ioners for an exchange of pri&s;oners have returned back without effecting an exchange for us. I look upon my&s;elf as doomed to be a pri&s;oner during the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Friday, June 8. Captain M'Kenno took his leave of us to go to Quebec, not to return again.</P>
<P>Saturday 9. This day the French walked in pro|ce&s;&s;ion round the chapel with their holy water; the prie&s;t was with them praying for rain.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, June 12. Capt. M'Fall has received &s;ome Engli&s;h papers from Quebec, which mention, that the Americans have revolted to &s;uch a degree, that General Wa&s;hington has &s;carcely a guard left him; that propo&s;als from Congre&s;s are &s;ent to the court of Great Britain, offering to accept of the propo&s;als which were made to them by the commi&s;|&s;ioners in the year 1778, but are refu&s;ed: but I &s;cruple it.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, 14. This day is held as A&s;cen&s;ion; but I believe every pari&s;h have their holy-days, and imagine they do not ob&s;erve a particular day through the whole province; for the Church of England hold the ninth of May as A&s;cen&s;ion, yet as every pa|ri&s;h is named after a &s;aint, &s;o I believe they have their &s;tanding holy time, to celebrate the different pa&s;&s;ions our Saviour pa&s;&s;ed through while on earth, or the mo&s;t remarkable ones. A &s;olemn ma&s;s was
<PB N="133" REF="027681_0131_0FD5DB515C49E9B0">
kept, and about twelve o'clock the little boys, with handkerchiefs, &amp;c. fixed in the manner of flying co|lours, were arranged in two columns, a &s;mall di&s;|tance apart; the young women were placed two by two next to the boys; a large &s;tandard, with two images hand&s;omely decorated, was carried in front of the boys, and about half way between the boys and girls, was a &s;ilver cro&s;s; the young men with long white &s;car&s;s or &s;urplices, went on to carry the holy-water and incen&s;e; the next was the clerk and &s;ingers, and then the prie&s;t, under a canopy carried by four men, holding a &s;mall gla&s;s, with a &s;mall im|age over it crowned with thorns, the prie&s;t looking through the gla&s;s; the old and married men and women walked after, intermixed, without any ar|rangement, in order to appearance, to defend their holy proce&s;&s;ion. They moved very &s;low and &s;o|lemn the whole way, &s;inging a &s;low and &s;eemingly well adapted &s;ound to grace the &s;olemnity of their devotion, and on the boys and young women arri|ving at the chapel, they filed off to the right and left to admit the prie&s;t to pa&s;s through, falling on their knees to prayer; the mini&s;ter, canopy, and as many married people as could, entered the chapel, where was the image, as I was informed, of the Virgin Mary, richly decorated; they continued about fif|teen minutes on their knees in the chapel, and tho&s;e who could not go in were the whole time on their knees at prayer. The prie&s;t then came out under the canopy as he entered, and the proce&s;&s;ion return|ed in the &s;ame manner as it came to the church. The whole appeared to be conducted with the pro|founde&s;t devoutne&s;s.</P>
<P>June 24. We who are pri&s;oners went this day to St. John's, where was a great day of wor&s;hip, and where their bi&s;hop, with a number of prie&s;ts
<PB N="134" REF="027681_0132_0FD5DB54632D0CF8">
and a great concou&s;e of people attended. On our return, my eyes never beheld the like of a &s;mall cat|terpillar, or rather a worm. Millions of them were on the fences, gra&s;s, and the young wheat; the &s;talks about &s;un&s;et appear black with them, which much alarms the inhabitants, as they &s;ay it is a very uncommon thing for them to appear &s;o thick, al|though they confe&s;s to be often troubled with &s;ome of a like kind; but the &s;everity of the drought, hav|ing had no rain to be of any &s;ervice &s;ince the &s;now went off, they imagine is one rea&s;on of there being &s;o many in the gra&s;s and wheat.</P>

The poor in|habitants appear &s;urrounded with conflicts and judg|ments, as the gra&s;shoppers bid fair to de&s;troy the &s;mall remaining crops, together with the worms and a &s;mall in&s;ect; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s they are the mo&s;t fervent in their prayers, that God would im|pede his judgments, of any people I ever &s;aw. Not an evening but they gather either at the church or by a cro&s;s, and there pray and &s;ing p&s;alms. They hold this as St. Peter's day, on which they &s;ay the keys of Heaven were given to him, and expect he will open the windows of Heaven and grant them &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings as they mo&s;t &s;tand in need of.

<P>10th. The whole pari&s;h a&s;&s;embled and walked in proce&s;&s;ion, to endeavor to defeat the in&s;ects, which appear as if they would de&s;troy their wheat, oars, flax, gra&s;s, and in fact every kind of vegetable. A poor woman in this pari&s;h dying &s;ome time pa&s;t, and not leaving a &s;ufficiency in ca&s;h to redeem her from purgatory, and her hu&s;band as is &s;aid, pleading po|verty, took her clothes to the church, where they

I have lived to &s;ee another birth-day; and on a reflection of the apparent &s;hortne&s;s of the time I have had an exi&s;tence, or the knowledge thereof; yet how many changing &s;cenes have I pa&s;s|ed, and what a variety of flowers and thorns have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hecquered my path; dangers e&s;caped and ble&s;&s;ings innumerable received, demands my warme&s;t tribute of prai&s;e.

them&s;elves to view in reflecting on a whole life, and that not &s;pent to the end which the Great Au|thor of my exi&s;tence &s;ent me into the world for: certainly, in&s;tead of rejoicing, I ought to line my heart and room in mourning, for &s;o long a mi&s;&s;pent life.</P>
<P>The French continue their prayers and proce&s;|&s;ions for the de&s;truction of the in&s;ects. They only walk from the chapel to the church, without any particular ceremony.</P>
<P>Friday, Augu&s;t 17. This day the inhabitants commence harve&s;ting. Their wheat in common is not more than eighteen or twenty inches long; al|though I &s;uppo&s;e it to be much &s;horter than com|mon on account of the drought; but from what I can learn, they &s;uppo&s;e their wheat to be good that is two and two and an half feet high; and whatever was formerly rai&s;ed from a bu&s;hel's &s;owing, I can|not learn but it mu&s;t have been much more than at pre&s;ent, for the inhabitants will talk of their fathers &s;elling five pecks for two and an half, and three li|vres, which is a French &s;hilling each livre, or about eighteen pence York, as near as I can inform my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Many of the inhabitants of this place &s;owed from thirty to forty bu&s;hels of wheat, and &s;carcely expect more than their &s;eed; although they &s;ay it is not the ca&s;e through the province. The men and wo|men, both old and young, have their &s;ickles, which is the only tool they know of in this province to har|ve&s;t with. To &s;ee the young ladies, with their mocki&s;ons reaping away, with a merry &s;ong, is a fine le&s;&s;on to promote contentment; for no doubt the next Sabbath they will go to church in their &s;ilks, and have the chat of which has cut the mo&s;t wheat in the week pa&s;t. I have been &s;o particular as to put down all the ve&s;&s;els I have &s;een pa&s;s up the river

which came from &s;ea, and I find that on the 27th of Augu&s;t, 1781, there have ninety-&s;ix &s;tout top-&s;ail ve&s;&s;els (chiefly &s;hips) gone up &s;ince the ice broke up in the &s;pring. The people have fini&s;hed harve&s;t|ing pretty generally.</P>
<P>Sept. 4. We petitioned General Haldiman rela|tive to our &s;ituation; being deprived of money from government, and receiving no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from home, we are almo&s;t de&s;titute of clothing.</P>
<P>On the 10th Captain Brown&s;on received a letter from Mr. Murray, informing him that he is ex|changed.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, 19. Captain Brown&s;on being pro|moted, is exchanged, as far as I can learn in the rank of a Major; and this morning him&s;elf and the boy that lived with us, by the name of Gri&s;would, took their leave of us, to return to their native homes. Poor Smith hangs his under lip; and in fact we all I believe feel rather di&s;comfited on the &s;ubject, altho' we are happy the Major is gone, on account of his being relea&s;ed from his confinement, and from a wi&s;h that his health may be re&s;tored: yet we hang our harps on the willows, not being able to form a|ny idea how the country who&s;e pro&s;perity we &s;o of|ten are wi&s;hing for, is now &s;ituated.</P>
<P>I again wrote a letter to my brother, John Scud|der, and Mr. Noah Mar&s;h, reque&s;ting them to be particular in the education of my children, which pledges are the greate&s;t anxiety and comfort to my inmo&s;t &s;oul.

<P>The rea&s;on for not putting the copy of this letter down &s;ooner is, we have expected an exchange would be made for us, or relief given &s;ome way; but are now in expectation of continuing another winter in this cold, dreary country, where the inha|bitants can &s;carcely get victuals to &s;upport nature; or at lea&s;t, if any family in the &s;tates of America

were to live as they do, I judge they would think it hard times indeed; but more of this another time: yet we are obliged to frequently be dependent on the people where we are quartered for &s;ome com|mon nece&s;&s;aries of life. It is evident to me that every per&s;on who takes up arms in the cau&s;e of his country, has an idea that he may meet with the fate of war, either by being killed, wounded or taken pri&s;oner; but it mu&s;t be a &s;evere reflection to &s;up|po&s;e, when he is thus voluntarily armed for the cau&s;e of his country, that in ca&s;e he &s;hould be made a pri&s;oner, he will be thus neglected by that country who&s;e rights he was contending for, and occa&s;ioned his impri&s;onment in cold jails, &amp;c. without the com|mon nece&s;&s;aries of life. However, it is a le&s;&s;en to learn &s;ilence, and wait with patience; for whatever God ordains is full of wi&s;e providences. How ma|ny thou&s;and years has this globe rolled on its axis, floated with a va&s;t ocean, high mountains, cities and empires, with millions of the planetary heavens, all moving in order under the guidance of &s;o great an Architect, to plant them all in due form, and &s;ay hi|therto &s;halt thou come and no farther: I &s;ay, when we con&s;ider that we are the creatures of &s;o g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t a Maje&s;ty, &s;urely we ought to wait with calmne&s;s un|til our change &s;hall come.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, October 3. Capt. M'Fall has left us; and &s;ince he has been exchanged, has been our commandant: and in order to &s;hew he was a man of authority, gave us &s;trict orders not to be &s;een to carry any kind of arms, except tho&s;e of our own bo|dies, and left the &s;ame orders with the Captain of the militia; pretending he hand orders from the commander in chief &s;o to do; and al&s;o that we &s;hould not be out of our lodgings after eight o'clock at night. We thank him for &s;uch a &s;ignal piece of

complai&s;ance; but wool will not grow from a hog's back. Poor Smith informs me that his thoughts at present are on procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life, hav|ing nothing but pork and bread to live on; and after many perplexing cogitations how to proceed, his only alternative is to go and dig potatoes. The Captain of the militia has di&s;pi&s;ed the orders left him by the la&s;t commander in chief over four of us, and permits us to go fowling. I find plenty of ducks and plover.</P>
<P>Saturday, 13th. I have had a hard turn of a fever; but find my&s;elf recovering. Having obtain|ed permi&s;&s;ion from government, to have the liberty of a&s;king credit of merchants (which, until within &s;ix weeks we could not be permitted to do, nor to write a line to any &s;ubject in Canada, except Mr. Murray, commi&s;&s;ary of pri&s;oners) we wrote the merchants a pre&s;&s;ing letter, &s;etting forth our indigent circum&s;tances; yet no other attention was paid to it than to &s;end us word we could not have any cre|dit. But I do not di&s;pair, although in a feeble &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, 16th. Capt. Smith and my&s;elf took a walk to St. John's; and will mention, that during the &s;ummer pa&s;t, Mr. Smith and my&s;elf have had &s;everal &s;erious, and I tru&s;t agreeable, conver&s;ations together on matters of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence; we both agree, that for wi&s;e purpo&s;es man was permit|ted to fall; for the more knowledge we obtain, the greater the &s;en&s;ation, and of con&s;equence happine&s;s or mi&s;ery is more natural to the &s;oul, as we cannot agree to any part of annihilation after death; for if the &s;oul is mi&s;erable, why &s;hould it be &s;o if there is not that remor&s;e of reflection on the duties and com|mands it di&s;obeyed whil&s;t on earth? Therefore, of con&s;equence, tho&s;e who die happy are un&s;peakably

&s;o, on the thought of having travelled through &s;o many toils, and &s;o weari&s;ome a pilgrimage while em|bodied in clay. We have often heard it &s;ugge&s;ted, that the &s;oul after departing from the body, knew nothing of what it had pa&s;&s;ed through in this life: as well might the idea of annihilation be held up; for it was the undoubted de&s;ign of the Great Au|thor of our exi&s;tence to &s;end us through the&s;e thorny roads, to prepare us for an event of the greate&s;t importance: if we acted aright, happine&s;s inexpre&s;&s;ible mu&s;t pre&s;ent to view; and on the con|trary, mi&s;ery without end or de&s;cription; and both on the reflection of a well or ill &s;pent life, the ado|ration on redemption, together with being relieved from a &s;inful &s;tate and made entirely pure, are thoughts un&s;peakable indeed; and al&s;o, if man had known no &s;in, he would have been ignorant of &s;o great a &s;alvation. Mr. Smith is a deep-thoughted gentleman.</P>
<P>Friday, October 19. Capt. Smith and Lieut. Dunning this day commenced cutting wood for the Canadians, at thirty coppers a cord, and find them|&s;elves. Poor Smith again hangs his under lip.</P>
<P>Monday, 22d. I went to a wedding in this par|i&s;h, and was immediately introduced to the bride, and had to dance a minuet with her, which is the vogue of this country; and their chief dances are minuets. No people that I have ever &s;een appear to be more friendly than the Canadians, in particu|lar on rejoicing days, weddings, public meetings, &amp;c. but remarkably more &s;o to &s;trangers than any people I have ever met with in any part of the &s;tates which I have vi&s;ited. The marriage ceremo|ny I believe to be nearly as the church of England, except, that the Roman Catholics of this coun|try always go to the church to have the ceremony performed.</P>

<P>Monday, October. Agreeable to a former re|que&s;t, I wrote to Mr. Murray for permi&s;&s;ion to go to Quebec for the re&s;toration of my health, being in want of clothing, &amp;c. I received orders, and this morning embarked for &s;aid place, and arrived in town in the evening. I tarried that night with Robert Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ran, and next morning went to Mr. Murray's, from whence I went to Mr. Prenti&s;s's, where I took breakfa&s;t, and then proceeded to the jail ho&s;pital, and agreed with Mr. Hill, who keeps the hou&s;e, to live with him. I am locked up, not having permi&s;&s;ion to go out without the company of Mr. Hill; but to make &s;ome compen&s;ation, I have the company of Mrs. Hill, my landlady, who is from Bo&s;ton, and a very agreeable woman; and al&s;o a Doctor Duff, one of the Surgeons of the ho&s;pital, who lodges up &s;tairs, and appears much of a gentle|man. There are &s;everal pri&s;oners in this place, a|mong whom is a Mr. Williams, formerly one of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers; but being &s;o far attached to the Americans, as to &s;peak &s;omething in their fa|vor, has been for &s;ome time under clo&s;e confinement.

I mu&s;t confe&s;s, if ever my heart felt gratitude, it was on this occa&s;ion. La&s;t evening I knew not how to ob|tain a &s;ingle farthing, being an entire &s;tranger; but have at pre&s;ent an ample &s;upply, with the rations I draw, for &s;ome time; and expect further a&s;&s;i&s;tance for Capt.

<P>PEGU, a con&s;iderable kingdom of A&s;ia, in the Ea&s;t Indies, on the &s;outhea&s;t &s;ide of the Bay of Ben|gal, bounded by the king of Ava on the north, by the mountains which &s;eparate it from Laos on the ea&s;t, by the king of Siam and the Bay of Bengal on the &s;outh, and by another part of the Bay of Bengal on the we&s;t. It has a town of the &s;ame name, &s;e|venty miles within land, and above twenty miles in circumference; but at pre&s;ent not one-twentieth part is inhabited; for it was ruined by the inhabi|tants of Barma, who&s;e king is a potent prince. This country, like others between the tropics, is flooded when the &s;un is vertical, but the mud and &s;lime which the waters leave when they retire, render the low lands fruitful as the Nile does tho&s;e of Egypt. As to the high grounds, they are &s;oon parched up after the rains

The hou&s;es are frequently built on pillars by the river &s;ide, and in the time of rains they have no communication with one another, but by boats, in the flat country. The product of this country is like the other parts of the Ea&s;t-Indies. They have al&s;o good fi&s;h, pork and poultry. They wear no European commodities but hats and ribbands. They have cottons, &s;ilks, and &s;ilver, from Bengal and the neighboring countries. The government is arbitrary, and the king's will is a law; yet he does not often abu&s;e his power: he has a large hand&s;ome palace at Ava, with four ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es, each of which is ap|propriated for people to pa&s;s through on different occa&s;ions; none but amba&s;&s;adors pa&s;s through the ea&s;t gate, which is called the golden gate. The in|habitants are but thinly clad, and the be&s;t among them wear neither &s;hoes nor &s;tockings. The Bar|maes go almo&s;t naked, and make figures in their &s;kins, like the ancient Picts, by pricking them&s;elves with a bodkin, and rubbing them over with cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|coal. The women are much whiter than the men; &s;mall, but well-proportioned. They wear petticoats which are open before; and this part of the dre&s;s was &s;aid to be invented by a queen of this country, to draw the men off from unnatural vices. The women are very fond of &s;trangers, and any man may have a wife for the time he &s;tays there. The wife goes to market, dre&s;&s;es the victuals, takes care of her hu&s;band's clothes, and &s;ells his goods by re|tail. If &s;he proves fal&s;e the hu&s;band may &s;ell her for a &s;lave; and if he goes a&s;tray, &s;he will give him a

The prie&s;ts have ground al|lowed them, which they cultivate for their &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, and are &s;aid to be &s;trict ob&s;ervers of morality. They are called talapoins, and inculcate charity as the highe&s;t virtue, affirming that religion to be be&s;t which teaches men to do the mo&s;t good. They have idols in their temples, in a &s;itting po&s;ture, like tailors, and very large ears. They have curious &s;orts of mu&s;ic; but the pipe and tabor are e&s;teemed the be&s;t. They have one in&s;trument &s;haped like a galley, with about twenty bells of different &s;izes; and when they &s;trike them with a &s;tick, they make no bad mu&s;ic. When any happen to be &s;hipwreck|ed on the coa&s;t, if they repair to the temples they will be taken care of, and &s;upplied with what they want. Their hills are covered with woods, and they have a great deal of good timber; but their bam|boes (a kind of hollow cane which grows to the big|ne&s;s of near a foot in diameter) is of the greate&s;t u&s;e; this they bend and form while young, making it fit for whatever they de&s;ign it, and particularly to hang their pelanquins upon: the&s;e are couches upon which they lie when they travel, carried upon men's &s;houlders. They have but few hor&s;es or &s;heep, and plow with oxen and buffaloes, and carry burdens on them as well as on camels; nor does any place abound more in elephants, than this, and the adjacent countries. They compute the &s;trength of their armies by the number and &s;ize of their ele|phants, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>INDIA, a va&s;t country of A&s;ia, which received its name from the river indus, &s;ituated partly in the temperate and partly under the torrid zone, and con&s;equently the air is very different. Towards the north it is pretty temperate; but towards the &s;outh, on the contrary, it is very hot, and it rains almo&s;t con&s;tantly for three months in the year, which ren|ders the heat more &s;upportable, and contributes to fertilize the ground, which produces abundance of rice, millet, cotton, &s;igs, pomegranates, Oran|ges, citron, cocoa-nuts, and many other fruits, of which there are none in Europe, but what have been tran&s;ported from thence. There are mines of gold and &s;ilver, and &s;everal &s;orts of precious &s;tones, borax and &s;alt petre. They fi&s;h in the &s;ea and riv|ers for pearls. This country produces &s;everal &s;orts of animals, as well dome&s;tic as wild; &s;uch as ele|phants, rhinocero&s;es, camels, dromedaries, buf|faloes, lions, tygers, leopards, panthers, and a va&s;t number of monkeys. The trade is exceeding great, and it chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of Indigo, &s;alt petre, cotton, and precious &s;tones; but more e&s;pecially in a prodi|geous quantity of calicoes, chintzes, and other &s;tuffs of various kinds. The Europeans had little or no intercour&s;e with the Indies, until the year 1498, when the Portugue&s;e di&s;covered a way by &s;ea, round the Cape of Good Hope, and then &s;oon began to make &s;ettlements therein, and &s;oon became very pow|erful, till the Dutch drove them away from many
<PB N="151" REF="027681_0149_0FD5DB76D3EC3070">
of their factories. The Indians are generally gen|toos or idolaters, though there are a great many mahometans; in the places that depend upon the Eu|ropeans, &s;ome of them have become Roman Catho|lics. Many of the idolaters believe in the tran&s;mi|gration of &s;ouls, and will not kill or eat any thing that has life; not the mo&s;t trifling in&s;ect or animal. The principal prie&s;ts are Brachmans, and there are faquiers who make their principal devotion to con&s;i&s;t in the choice of the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome po&s;tures, which they never leave till they take their la&s;t exit. Some pa&s;s &s;everal years without laying down night or day, re&s;ting only upon a cord which is &s;tretched out; others &s;hut them&s;elves up in a cave &s;everal days without eating or drinking; &s;ome hold their arms lifted up &s;o long that they can never &s;tir them afterwards; in &s;hort others put burning coals on their heads, and let them be there till the fire reach|es the very bones. Sometimes tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aquiers go in a body together, followed by a great number of di&s;ciples, and they often make a merit of killing Chri&s;tians. It was a cu&s;tom among the gentoos, for the women to burn them&s;elves with their decea&s;ed hu&s;bands; but it is not &s;o frequent as it formerly was, becau&s;e the mahometans will not allow of it.</P>
<P>The people of Proper India, as well as tho&s;e of China, who ought to know better, pro&s;trate them|&s;elves on the ground with great devotion, that the &s;un and moon when eclip&s;ed may not be devoured by a certain dragon to which they imagine the defect of light is owing. The Pagans wor&s;hip idols of vari|ous &s;hapes: &s;ome appear very mon&s;trous, part hu|man and part bea&s;t or fi&s;h, and &s;carce any living ani|mal but what they adore, particularly the ox and the monkey.

I am now to prepare for another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rigid, cold, and poor country; therefore have called on my employ|er, Doctor Serjeant Hunt, who is only a purveyor, or a&s;&s;i&s;tant, in the ho&s;pital, and under&s;tands medi|cine &s;omething better than I do, but no great, and is nothing at all on my part. He has put up for my &s;ervices in po&s;ting books, three pounds of green tea, &s;ugar, port wine, &amp;c. I expre&s;&s;ed to Mr. and Mrs. Hill, my &s;orrow at being obliged to go away, and they appeared no le&s;s to regret my departure, as no people ever could have u&s;ed a pri&s;oner more friendly than I was treated by them, and al&s;o by Doctor Duff. I mentioned to Duff, that if I had his abilities, or under&s;tood any thing relative to me|dicine, I could get a good living on the I&s;le of Or|leans. He immediately replied that he would make a Doctor of me in a few hours, and ordered &s;everal kinds of medicine put up, and wrote particular di|rections on each medicine, and for what u&s;e; he have me two crown lancets to bleed with, and Buchan's Family Phy&s;ician, as a guide in my practice. The medicine, phials, &amp;c. being arranged in good order in my che&s;t, I felt important, and portended relief, although I had never thought of being beneficial to mankind in this way before, and in the agitation of my mind, never &s;hall. We had not more than fixed the medicines and my other affairs, before in came a Canadian for me, whom Doctor Duff addre&s;&s;ed in the following manner: "Sir, the gentleman who is going with you to the I&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Orleans, is a great Doctor from the States of America, and has never di&s;covered it whil&s;t living on the I&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Orleans, on account of not being able to &s;peak French, and al&s;o for the want of medicine and the like"&mdash;on

I then took my leave of Mr. Hill, Mrs. Hill, Doctor Duff, with the family and poor pri&s;oners, and went down to the provo&s;t, took din|ner with Me&s;&s;rs. Hay, Cazeau and Gordon; and about two o'clock, bade them and the re&s;t of the pri|&s;oners in that provo&s;t farewell. The other officers might have gone to the I&s;le of Orleans, but cho&s;e to &s;tay until &s;pring. The two Banters went in one carriol, and a Mr. Patter&s;on of the Briti&s;h line, and my&s;elf in another. Mr. Patter&s;on is going down to be our commandant. We had good hor&s;es and made headway fa&s;t over the ice, and &s;truck the I&s;le of Or|leans with re&s;olution as officers and phy&s;icians of con|&s;equence; and in&s;tead of going by St. Lawrence, or Cileroy, we went by the pari&s;h of St. Peter (or St. Pierre) where I had again to re&s;ume my jabbering of French, and a bungling hand I make of it; and amof opinion, if the King of France knew how I tare his language to pieces, he would tare my hair. We are at the Captain of the Militia's hou&s;e; the old man is &s;omething deaf, and has been &s;o for about twenty years. He is above &s;ixty years old, but it matters not with me: I inform him that his hearing can be re&s;tored, which makes him chearful, and he promi&s;es to become one of my patients. However, I took a little bay &s;alt, which I di&s;&s;olved and put in his ears; I &s;tuffed them full of wool before he went to bed, and made him as deaf as an adder that night. The next morning, on taking out the wool, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf much better, although I do not be|lieve it.

Many complaints have this day appeared before me; but I led them into a &s;ecret, that my medicines are all locked up; that they are of a good quality, new and fre&s;h from England, and &s;ome from France; and if they want to employ me, I will wait on them at any time; but no advice can be given gratis, without it is to poor people who have no money nor e&s;tate, which they think is <HI>bone,</HI> or right.</P>

It is generally con&s;trued, that the Roman prie&s;ts give the la&s;t benediction to dying per&s;ons, and forgive their &s;ins, which Mr. Duran di&s;ap|proves, any farther than it is an ordinance and com|mand, to lay the hands on the &s;ick, pray over them, and give the la&s;t &s;acrament, according to the order of Saint James; but as to be in&s;truments of forgiving &s;ins, he utterly denies it; or why &s;hould &s;ouls go to purgatory, everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, &amp;c.

&s;trong propen&s;ity to form the mind, and from daily experience, it is not ea&s;y to pur&s;uade a per&s;on from that which was cultivated in him from infancy. A chain of reflections on this may ari&s;e: but this I hold&mdash;that there is a ju&s;t and merciful God, who is the former of worlds unknown, and every part thereof, and that whoever bows the knee to &s;o great a Sovereign, with a heart full of humility, and hath a reverential eye towards him as their Parent of nature, humbly reque&s;ting a forgivene&s;s of their &s;ins, mercy awaits them in their final exit from this world, whatever their form of religion may be. Official characters, who&s;e religion is their own, may de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e &s;entiments, and call them dei&s;tical; but in &s;uch brea&s;ts, philanthropy towards our fellow mortals mu&s;t be wanting; for our Saviour &s;ays&mdash;"when I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto me:" yet I &s;uppo&s;e a doubt cannot exi&s;t in a human heart, that it was the meaning of our Saviour, to draw all men unto him that did not pay a reverential homage to the Supreme Lord, and to ca&s;t their dependence on him only, and not on their particular manner of wor&s;hip; or rather the form of ceremonies. Still as I before ob&s;erved, per&s;ons are apt to be tenacious as to the mode in which they are educated, and have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, often lay &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s on them as to fall into error, by placing too much de|pendence on their outward performances; and what &s;till adds to the pre&s;umption, tho&s;e who are know|ing to the contrary, will teach them &s;uch for the &s;ake of gain; and would only wi&s;h to be under&s;tood, that every contrite heart will meet with a good re|ward; therefore, it is nece&s;&s;ary to look to our&s;elves, as well as of different per&s;ua&s;ions, le&s;t we di&s;cover the mote in their eye, and not the beam in our own.</P>

February 10. Great fea&s;ting commences again.</P>
<P>Monday, 11. The inhabitants a&s;&s;emble and fea&s;t with &s;ociability.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day. Mr. Patter&s;on and my&s;elf took a walk to the other &s;ide of the pari&s;h this morning, where we found the people, to appearance, like &s;tupid ani|mals; for they have eat and drank, danced, &s;ung and capered, until they now appear almo&s;t like &s;tu|pid manuments; but as it is the la&s;t day of their fea&s;ting, and then fa&s;ting for forty days commences, in the cogitation of my brain, in one hour, two mi|nutes and five &s;econds, they will begin to &s;ri&s;k., The fact is, in this country, generally &s;peaking, the inhabitants live va&s;tly poor, to what they do in the &s;tates of America: for their breakfa&s;t is con&s;tantly a piece of bread, and if an onion can be had it is an excellent repa&s;t. Their dinner is at twelve o'clock, which is made by boiling a &s;mall piece of pork or beef, but mo&s;tly pork; and in the winter, the inha|bitants have peas, with vegetables, which are boiled&punc; with the meat, and have al&s;o &s;hred cabbage, onions, &amp;c. and to fini&s;h, a bowl of bread cut thin, which ta&s;tes palatable, and is for dinner and &s;upper; but in &s;ummer, meat is commonly &s;cant. I have known hard labouring families to breakfa&s;t on bread, dine and &s;up on any kind of vegetables that can be ga|thered, &s;uch as long &s;orrel, and other wild herbs, before their gardens come on: the&s;e herbs are boiled and bread is &s;hred into them, with &s;ome milk, and not a mor&s;el of meat; but I am informed the whole province do not live in &s;o poor a manner; but they never make a di&s;h of coffee or chocolate, and as to tea, they are entirely ignorant of it. I am told it was formerly the cu&s;tom for the inhabitants to have a little cheap wine, which is called black &s;trap, or the dregs of port, to drink a gla&s;s of in the morn|ing

with their bread, or a little rum; but I &s;ee none of the like on this i&s;land, except on &s;uch occa|&s;ions as their fea&s;tings, &amp;c. I have attempted to inform them, in my way of jabbering French, the way in which the Bo&s;tonians live (for &s;uch all the American people are called by the Canadians.) In the fir&s;t place, we have our tea, coffee, or chocolate, in the morning, and a piece of beef, chee&s;e or &s;hort|cake; and for dinner, we have meat plenty, and very little &s;oup, with turnips, potatoes, cabbage, and garden roots, &amp;c. In the afternoon, tea again; and for &s;upper, either meat, bread and ve|getables, or a di&s;h of mu&s;h and milk; and in winter a mug of cyder, and that we thought nothing of giving away a mug or two in the evening's chat, to a neighbour, &amp;c. and to be &s;ure I told as good a &s;tory of my native place as it de&s;erved, and of the American States in general, which drew great at|tention. I al&s;o informed them, that the ladies of our country wore high-heeled &s;hoes, and the riche&s;t cloth, and that every day; which information they could &s;tand no longer, and exclaimed, "La Bo&s;tona montier cum la diabol:"&mdash;that is, the Bo&s;tonian lies like the devil: for the women of this country all wears mocki&s;ons every day, as well as the men.</P>
<P>They have potatoes in this country, but do not rai&s;e &s;o plenty as in the &s;tates, and I have &s;een very few turnips or garden roots, except onions, which are generally rai&s;ed, and are large; but the idea of garlics being much u&s;ed in this province, I believe is ill-founded, as I have never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">een any eat.

<P>INDOSTAN, Proper India, or the Empire of the Great Mogul, is bounded on the we&s;t by Per&s;ia, on the &s;outh by the we&s;tern Penin&s;ula, on the ea&s;t by the ea&s;tern Penin&s;ula, and on the north by &s;eve|ral kingdoms of Independent Tartary.

The inhabitants are more hu|mane with regard to &s;trangers, and not &s;o great enemies to Chri&s;tians as the Turks, although they dre&s;s in the &s;ame manner, and take &s;everal wives, being much addicted to luxury.

<P>PETERSBURGH, a large hand&s;ome city, the capital of Ru&s;&s;ia, built by Peter the Great, Czar of Mu&s;cova, in the year 1703. It is of prodigeous extent, and contained not long ago, &s;ixty thou&s;and hou&s;es. It is &s;eated on an i&s;land, which lies in the middle of the river Neiva, where the land is con&s;i|derably rai&s;ed. The wor&s;t of this place is, that the land is not high enough to e&s;cape inundations, which at times has occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of va&s;t &s;ums of mo|ney, by rea&s;on of the fortifications being wa&s;hed a|way before they were well fini&s;hed. The breadth of the river at Peter&s;burgh, is about half a mile; and as it is very deep and rapid, the building of a bridge over it was held impracticable, whereupon it was propo&s;ed to the Czar, Peter the Great, to make a bridge of pontoons or boats; but he would not con|&s;ent to it, he &s;aid, becau&s;e his intention was to
<PB N="169" REF="027681_0167_0FD5DBAEE93193F8">
breed up as many watermen as he could, and the&s;e he prohibited the u&s;e of oars, that they might learn to manage &s;ails; but the&s;e boatmen being ignorant pea&s;ants, many people were drowned in pa&s;&s;ing from one part of the town to the other, at fir&s;t. The nobility and people of di&s;tinction were obliged to build grand hou&s;es here, but the generality were timber hou&s;es, till they began to burn brick, and the town now appears with a much better face than it did at fir&s;t. The trade was &s;mall and provi&s;ions &s;carce, becau&s;e the lakes Ladoga and Onega, had not depth enough to carry large ve&s;&s;els, but Peter the Great, remedied this inconvenience, in 1720, by cutting a canal from lake Ladoga, of about &s;eventy-five miles in length, &s;eventy feet in breadth, and ten in depth; ten years were employed in this work. It is a va&s;t place of trade, and flouri&s;hing. All kinds of religion are tolerated, and foreigners have the &s;ame privileges with the natives. A new road is made between Peter&s;burgh and Mo&s;cow, in a &s;traight line acro&s;s the fore&s;ts, planted with trees on each &s;ide; five hundred and fifty miles in length, and at every eight miles is a large po&s;t, &s;at up to direct travellers, and at every &s;tation are twenty hor&s;es kept &s;addled and bridled for an immediate ex|pre&s;s. The inhabitants are reckoned at one hun|dred thou&s;and, from all countries, there being not many original natives. It may &s;eem &s;trange that Peter the Great, &s;hould fix upon this place to build his capital city, it lying in a barren country, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar to the north, that they &s;carce enjoy the light of the &s;un in the winter; but it was in order to have a communication with the Baltic &s;ea, and that his &s;ubjects might traffic with the re&s;t of the nations of Europe, for as yet there was no &s;ea that touched upon the territory of Ru&s;&s;ia, but that of Archangel, to

which &s;hipping was obliged to pa&s;s through the fro|zen ocean. It was notwith&s;tanding the pro&s;pect of trade, with great difficulty that the Czar compa&s;&s;ed this grand de&s;ign, his &s;ubjects &s;hewing the utmo&s;t aver&s;on to removing to this cold, barren country, as he commanded them, from all parts of his dominions, and &s;uch rubs were laid in his way by his nobility and officers, that it was thought impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould effect his de&s;ign. There was neither &s;ufficient tools or provi&s;ions provided for the workmen, who &s;uffer|ed all manner of hard&s;hips, in&s;omuch that it is com|puted no le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and people pe|ri&s;hed in laying the foundation, and building this metropolis. However, all difficulties were at length overcome, and the &s;ixty thou&s;and hou&s;es were all built in le&s;s than four years, and is now one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous cities in the world. The Czar e&s;tabli&s;hed here an academy marine, to which he obliged every con&s;iderable family in his empire to &s;end one of their &s;ons or relations to be in&s;tructed in navigation; here al&s;o they learnt the dead langua|ges, were taught to ride and fence, and other exer|ci&s;es. He &s;et up woolen and linen manufactories, had paper-mills, powder-mills, laboratories for gun|nery and fire-works, places for preparing &s;altpetre and brim&s;tone; he erected yards for making cables and tackling for his navy, and a foundery, where they are perpetually ca&s;ting great guns, mortars, and &s;mall arms; the country furni&s;hing him with va&s;t quantities of iron-ore. A printing-hou&s;e was al&s;o &s;et up to encourage his &s;ubjects to enquire into the &s;tate of the world; and he &s;ent many of them to foreign countries, to learn mechanic arts, giving great encouragement to foreigners to come to Pe|ter&s;burg, and in&s;truct his people in every &s;cience; plays, operas, and mu&s;ic-meetings were al&s;o intro|duced,

<P>Thur&s;day, 28th&punc; It being a &s;nowy day, which my eyes are often &s;aluted with; I take another turn of mentioning what &s;uper&s;tition and gro&s;s ignorance, many Canadians are led into. The following in|formation is given to me as a fact, by old people, and as many more as I have hairs in my eyebrows: In the pari&s;h on the other &s;ide of the river, which is named St. Ann, is the &s;tatue of St. Ann in the church, which they hold performs many miracles, &s;uch as re&s;toring &s;ight to the blind, healing the &s;ick; and lame per&s;ons who go into the church on crutches are re&s;tored to health, and leave their crutches be|hind as a &s;tanding monument of their being healed, which are any day to be &s;een in the chapel. I was urged to take a tour thither, and was a&s;&s;ured I would find the crutches hanging up according to their word; but I never went, having no faith. However, as they &s;ay, about &s;ix years ago, a man had a little &s;on murdered; the &s;i&s;ter of the hu&s;band, who was privy to the murder of the child, told her brother, or the bereaved, that his wife was the per|&s;on who was guilty of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">act; upon which he took his wife &s;o accu&s;ed, into the woods, in order to murder her: but &s;he begged her life, and &s;aid if he
<PB N="172" REF="027681_0170_0FD5DB03EB9D40B0">
would break both her arms, &s;he would never return until they were re&s;tored, which would be in three days, by praying to St. Ann; and if not, &s;he would &s;tarve in &s;aid place, which would declare her guilt or innocence; and finally was per&s;uaded to break both her arms. She reque&s;ted a book might be pla|ced before her, fixed on a &s;tick, &s;o that by blowing the leaves, &s;he could turn them. As he was going from her, a thorn ran into his foot, which &s;he pray|ed might never be extracted but by her hands. The hu&s;band went home, but no relief could be found; and he was obliged to return to his wife although in the greate&s;t pain. On his return he found her in the &s;ame place, perfectly re&s;tored to health; her arms were well, and &s;he immediately pulled the thorn from his foot. They both recovered and re|turned home with joy. They &s;ay the woman is now living in &s;aid pari&s;h. She was con&s;tant in prayer to St. Ann, who not only re&s;tored her arms and health, but told her who was the murderer of the child, and the young woman was hung, &amp;c.</P>
<P>My doctoring has not added, as yet, much to my wealth. I have been called frequently to admini&s;ter medicines; but make a bad hand of it, in particular as to bleeding. I was &s;ent for by Mrs. Bunet (where Capt. Smith lives) to bleed her, and it being the fir&s;t time I had ever attempted any thing of the kind, was much at a lo&s;s how to proceed; but receiving &s;ome directions from Smith, &amp;c. I went to the hou&s;e, where my patient was &s;itting by a &s;tove, with her feet up to her knees in warm water. I a&s;ked her if &s;he would be bled in the foot; &s;he &s;aid no, <HI>la braun&punc;</HI> or arm; on which, for the fir&s;t time, I tied a garter, with judgment, as far as I knew at any rate. A large vein &s;oon appeared, and I gave it the lancet, which made the blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly merrily. The woman be|ing
<PB N="173" REF="027681_0171_0FD5DB0269FEB798">
very warm, bled freely and &s;oon began to grow faint; on which I untied the arm, but to no purpo&s;e; the blood ran, &s;he fainted and cried out <HI>pinche! pinche!</HI> that was to pinch the orifice. I immediate|ly obeyed orders, and held her arm from bleeding until &s;he was lain on the bed; but the in&s;tant I took my fingers away, the blood would fly. At la&s;t Smith di&s;covered an old powder horn, in which was common powder for hunting; he ma&s;hed &s;ome of the powder and put it on the place, which in|&s;tantly &s;topped the bleeding; and ever after that I carried ma&s;hed gunpowder with me to &s;top the blood, and was e&s;teemed &s;till a &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>An old man on the other &s;ide of the pari&s;h who was unwel, &s;ent for me.

He lived a few days; but being old and low in health, and having for a long time been irregular in his bo|dy, he left the world, and I hope in peace; at lea&s;t I do not judge that what I gave him ha&s;tened him out any &s;ooner; if it did, I was not to blame; for phy&s;ic he would have. I have been examined by the par&s;on of the pari&s;h&punc; to know if my abilities in phy&s;ic are equal to my preten&s;ions.

Some old men advi&s;ed me not to &s;ow my turnips until after the proce&s;&s;ion at St. Pierre, which was on the 10th of June; for then they expected the in|&s;ects would di&s;appear: accordingly, to plea&s;e them, I waited until the 17th and &s;owed with the neighbors; but they all &s;hared the common lot: the gra&s;hop|pers took the whole. The prie&s;ts do not admit a per&s;on to be buried in their church-yard, if they find out that the &s;aid per&s;on had not confe&s;&s;ed all his &s;ins. The people will often go from one pari&s;h to another to confe&s;s; and if any one has been guilty of &s;ome gro&s;s &s;in, and dies unconfe&s;&s;ed of it, he or &s;he is bu|ried on their place: and I am informed unbaptized infants are &s;erved in the &s;ame manner. I often at|tend their ma&s;s, and never knew it fail, that &s;ome of them, having before confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed their &s;ins, receive the benediction; or, in our words, a pardon for their &s;ins. The ceremony of the ma&s;s is performed with a &s;eeming &s;olemnity. The prie&s;t &s;tands before the altar, in the middle of which is a &s;mall looking-gla&s;s; he puts his hand into a &s;mall locker behind the gla&s;s, and takes out a cup, which I &s;uppo&s;e is &s;ilver, and wa&s;hes it; after the cup is wa&s;hed, he is for &s;ome time &s;huffling and &s;peaking low: the clerks keep the whole time &s;inging; and after a con&s;iderable bowing and continued &s;peaking for a long time, the boys who wait on him bring a little white cup; he takes it, and pours &s;omething into a gla&s;s, and after &s;ome low, and to appearance inarticulate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounds being ut|tered, and bowing frequently, he drinks what is in the gla&s;s; and after &s;ome time is again elap&s;ed, he faces the congregation, when all who receive the be|nediction, a&s;&s;emble at the front of the altar and kneel down, when the prie&s;t, after a &s;hort ceremo|ny, gives each per&s;on, or rather puts into their mouths, a wafer.

They one and all (and I have talked with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;i|ble of them) believe that our Saviour comes in per|&s;on behind the gla&s;s which is on the altar, and there &s;anctifies the &s;acramental wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er; and that at the time the prie&s;t is uttering his devotion in a low tone, he is that in&s;tant talking with Chri&s;t, face to face, and hold that he is omnipre&s;ent, and can at one time be at a million, or a million of millions of ma&s;&s;es, and &s;anctify the wafer; and are &s;o full in the faith, that they fully believe, &s;hould they die the in&s;tant the wafer is put on their tongue, they would immedi|ately a&s;cend to Paradi&s;e. It appears to be hard to judge, le&s;t I be judged; but one thing is certain&mdash;if they are erroneous in their doctrine, the common people are ignorant. However, this much can be &s;aid of the Roman Catholics, that in all their wor|&s;hiping, they believe, and endeavor in one part and the other of it, to commemorate the pa&s;&s;ions of our dying Lord. They never eat a piece of bread nor any kind of food, before they lay their hands on their brea&s;t, make the &s;ign of a cro&s;s, and a&s;k a ble&s;&s;ing on the provi&s;ion they are going to partake of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> They never lie down at night, nor ri&s;e in the morning, without going to prayer.

depended on their ceremonies to &s;ave them, and indeed &s;ome mini&s;ters will preach &s;uch doctrine. Ac|cording to my opinion of the nature of things, rea|&s;on ought always to be the clue on which &s;ound judgment &s;hould re&s;t; for through all the different &s;cenes of life, where on mature con&s;ideration, any thing appears unrea&s;onable, it puts the mind in &s;u&s;pence: for in&s;tance, one will preach up this kind, and the other that kind of doctrine, to attain &s;al|vation; but certainly no one, can condemn the great article of prayer. This we hold, that it is rea&s;onable, rational, and right, to bow the knee, but more particularly the heart, to the Supreme God; therefore, &s;o far as touches prayer the Ro|man Catholics, cannot be condemned; and as to Chri&s;t's appearing in per&s;on, it mu&s;t entirely be attri|buted to ignorance, &amp; the craft of prie&s;ts. Solomon I think, &s;omewhere tells us, that every generation grows wi&s;er, and I am of opinion that bigotry in a few years will decrea&s;e fa&s;t, in particular through the United States, and that the people's eyes will be more awakened, than to believe that there is no get|ting to heaven only by a certain per&s;ua&s;ion; in fact, the different denominations have crept in through prie&s;t-craft, and to &s;ay &s;uch a mode is right, and no other, de&s;erves the ridicule and &s;corn of an enlight|ened people: &s;till, as far as has come to my know|ledge of the different per&s;ua&s;ions, I condemn none; and for con&s;cience &s;ake, let all agree with Paul, that every man may be per&s;uaded in his own mind, and not condemn another. This I al&s;o believe, that it is more ju&s;tifiable to pray and wor&s;hip God, than to live as thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of the Pro|te&s;tants do, who &s;eemingly go through the world with|out the lea&s;t affinity to devotion, and live and die like the wild a&s;&s;es colt.

<P>March 16, 1782. We are making preparations to make &s;ugar. I a&s;&s;ure you, Scudder, your hands would not labor in the&s;e cold &amp; inho&s;pitable climes, in particular through the &s;now and &s;uch weather, to get a little &s;ugar, if it could be helped or nece&s;&s;ity did not enforce it. My doctoring thrives &s;lowly:&mdash;but let me &s;ee what of the clock. I &s;uppo&s;e it to be thirty three minutes after three. I mu&s;t again at|tend at a certain hou&s;e in the pari&s;h, where a wo|man has for a long time been very ill, and I have frequently attended to admini&s;ter relief, having or|dered in my &s;erious and great judgment, flann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> cloths dipped in warm herb teas, to be outwardly applied, and &s;ome bohea tea to take as a collateral, which in the inflamatory &s;ituation &s;he appeared to be in, I thought mu&s;t be va&s;tly beneficial. I al&s;o ordered barley-water, and by turns a few drops of

acid of elixir in her bohea; yet, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e pre&s;criptions were conformed to with alertne&s;s and punctuality, &s;he delayed: I &s;ay &s;he delayed; which occa&s;ioned another &s;killful phy&s;ician to be &s;ent for from St. Farme; and after his arrival, I was notified to give my attendance, which &s;ummons I immediately gave obedience to; and it being about three quarters of a mile, I drove pretty bri&s;k on foot, until I came to the hou&s;e where my <HI>bone fam,</HI> or good woman lay, and rapped at the door, and near as po&s;&s;ible to re&s;emble a great man; and having a doctor's &s;haped hat, entered the door, big with phy|&s;ic, and approached the doctor, who was &s;eated in a chair: I &s;ay I approached him, and that with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect. He aro&s;e to pay me a com|pliment, on which I di&s;covered he was a man of a good &s;ize, and by his ruffles and dre&s;s, concluded he could &s;peak French, &amp; a noble a&s;pect was in his phiz. I read that two great doctors were &s;aluting each other, by way of bowing, nodding, and glancing at each other. Our pre&s;ent compliments ended by my &s;eating the doctor. I then a&s;ked my patient, with &s;omewhat more emotion of mind than was u&s;ual, how her health was. She an&s;wered <HI>deces maw,</HI> or &s;lowly. I made &s;trict inquiry whether my orders had been attended to, and was fearful &s;ome neg|lect had taken place; but was an&s;wered &s;atisfactorily. I felt of her pul&s;e, examined her tongue and eyes, calling on my brother doctor to &s;tand by and hear the examination, &s;hewing my medicine, except my tea, which I told him was an American herb, and pro|nounced her <HI>micure,</HI> or better: at which &s;he &s;aid &s;he thought &s;he was, although &s;eeble. We agreed &s;he was feeble, but was in hopes of her recovery&mdash;on which we feated our&s;elves, and I had another view of my brother doctor. His eyes were of a

lighti&s;h ca&s;t and be&s;poke malice, although apparently full of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as I thought he &s;eemed rather awed at my pre&s;ence, having the fame of a great &s;urgeon. However, after a few &s;urveys on each other, and now and then a word, I aro&s;e with com|po&s;ure, and a&s;ked him a civil que&s;tion, which was no le&s;s than to take a &s;mall walk to con&s;ult about the good <HI>fam.</HI> He obeyed my &s;ummons; and after we were from the itching eyes of the whole world, I recapitulated the whole of my performances, and looked on her to be &s;o feeble that medicine was u&s;e|le&s;s. He pronounced judgment in my favor; for in his great opinion, he did not know, at &s;o infeebled a &s;ituation, of any medicine that would afford relief: &s;till we unanimou&s;ly agreed, <HI>nem. con.</HI> to contem|plate for a few minutes, if any medicine could be thought of for the woman's relief. A &s;ilence enfu|ed, and we walked pen&s;ive and &s;low, wheeled with judgment and compo&s;ure, ca&s;ting up and down, form|ing angles and triangles in our contemplations; and to be &s;ure, to &s;ee my brother doctor (who I &s;uppo&s;e knew very little more of phy&s;ic than my&s;elf) in &s;o deep a &s;tudy, was a trial for me to endure; for I thought frequently, in &s;pite of every effort, I &s;hould have laughed aloud on the &s;pot. At length I &s;poke to the doctor; on which he acco&s;ted me in full po|litene&s;s, when I demanded if he had thought of any thing for the u&s;e of the patient? he &s;hook his head. Again, he was a&s;ked if he thought on any outward application, except what had already been tried? He &s;hook his head. Again, I a&s;ked what he thought of her? He &s;hook his head, and &s;aid <HI>mallard,</HI> which is bad. Can medicine do any good? He &s;hook his head, and &s;aid no again. Will not a little ro&s;emary be of u&s;e? He &s;aid <HI>we,</HI> or yes. We then judiciou&s;|ly agreed on diet, and a few ro&s;emary drops to be

given to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;tomach. A &s;mall quantity was given in a phial. I told my patient to keep good courage, that we were in hopes of her life. My doctor confirmed the &s;ame. After which I, being a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, was about leaving the hou&s;e, and offered my hand to the doctor, by way of farewel, and a&s;ked, while our hands were &s;haking&mdash;Doctor, will you vi&s;it the patient again? He &s;hook his head.&mdash;Will you vi&s;it me me? He &s;hook his head&mdash;Will you come if again called on by me? He an&s;wered, yes. The&s;e que&s;tions being over, I then read that a phy&s;ician's hand had hold of a phy&s;ician's hand, and great hands they were, particularly as to phy&s;ic. Our bodies were brought forward with regularity and decorum, and&punc; a due regard to our feet being properly placed, having my eye the whole time up|on my brother doctor, who appeared to be a Cana|dian and a man of good parts; his hair white, red no&s;e, &s;hort wai&s;ted coat, clum&s;y under clothes and parts which they covered. I had the honor of his company to the door, and he wi&s;hed me good &s;peed.</P>
<P>March 17. It being Sabbath day, on which I have more retirement than on other days of the week, &s;ome occurrences are brought to my mind, which have happened in life, particularly in the ar|my. It was a cu&s;tom to keep St. Patrick's day, which I believe very few knew the meaning of, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s to be ignorant of the cau&s;e to this mi|nute; yet it was a cu&s;tom, like many other cu&s;toms that have a tendency to folly. How much more im|proving would it be, to endeavor to &s;ea&s;on the mind with rea&s;on, and re&s;olve to have the intellectual part governing and directing me to love and even embrace all the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence towards me; to pre&s;erve the dignity placed in the brea&s;t pure and undi&s;turbed, and amid a croud of imagin|ations,

<P>Thur&s;day, 21. We have begun to prepare troughs for making &s;ugar, which made my hands &s;ore enough.</P>
<P>Sunday, 24. My poor carca&s;e is pretty much worn in the &s;ugar preparation, having cut wood, dug troughs, dug &s;now, and what not. I am rack|ed in every joint; my limbs are &s;tiff, the nerves throb, and convul&s;ed feelings pervade my whole frame, and to add to my comfort, I am called on to go two miles to bleed a poor man, and cannot of con|&s;cience a&s;k any pay.</P>
<P>I have paid my patient his vi&s;it, and on my return, found a man who ye&s;terday left town, and he informs me, that the news of peace is vani&s;h|ed. What &s;hall I now &s;ay! However, in this jour|nal a remark will not be ami&s;s: for in &s;pite of my pretended efforts, I am &s;unk to the centre; for &s;o contra&s;ted a me&s;&s;age, &s;trikes the root of all my hopes. But &s;urely the day is at hand: I will never give it up. How am I to&s;&s;ed on this life's tempe&s;tu|ous &s;ea. Ye&s;terday the mind (though the body was digging in &s;now) was like a ve&s;&s;el with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ails full &s;pread, in &s;ight of the de&s;ired harbor, but lo&s;t on the rocks at her entrance:&mdash;So it is with poor man. Our imaginations &s;pread far and wide; we &s;ail on the imaginary billows, but do not fathom the diffi|culties of the ocean on which we are embarked; for life is often compared to the troubled &s;ea, a warfare, &amp;c. therefore let this teach me, that all earthly di&s;|appointments &s;hould be my &s;choolma&s;ter, to aid me in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cking for a better, yea, a heavenly country.</P>
<P>Weden&s;day. 27. We have got our &s;ugar-works
<PB N="185" REF="027681_0183_0FD5CD00416B8A68">
in order, and cut &s;even cords of wood, to pay the owner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or permi&s;&s;ion to make &s;ugar. The labor that I have gone through for &s;ome days pa&s;t, has a tendency to divert the mind, but there is &s;till a hea|vy impre&s;&s;ion, which is encrea&s;ed by &s;ome conver&s;a|tion Capt. Smith and I have had on the immortality of the &s;oul; as &s;ome pretend there is no &s;urviving after death; &s;ome will agree that the &s;oul lies dor|mant, and will not awake until the morning of the re&s;urrection, when it will ri&s;e up and appear as from an over night's &s;lumber. The&s;e are weighty ideas; but I hold, with Cato, that the &s;oul is &s;ecu|red in its exi&s;tence, and will flouri&s;h forever in im|mortal youth; for it is ever on the wing, by day and by night, &s;earching after new hidden objects, building ca&s;tles in the air, and, as Doctor Young &s;ays, walking among the &s;tars. The mind being never inactive, is a great proof that the &s;oul is too noble to cea&s;e; for in ca&s;e of its being dormant after death, that part of eternity which was begun in man when he became a living &s;oul, mu&s;t be lo&s;t; there|fore at the fir&s;t embryo of man's creation, I am ful|ly of opinion, it is for nothing &s;hort of an endle&s;s duration. But &s;uch meditations are too deep for me, who am of a weak under&s;tanding, and wanting in education: but &s;o far I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay&mdash;that the&s;e &s;enti|ments are my own, and not borrowed, as Captain Smith differs with me in this part. He is a man of &s;en&s;e, but in this I think he is erroneous.</P>
<P>Friday, 29. Ye&s;terday and la&s;t night we had a remarkably &s;evere &s;now &s;torm. The young wo|men went la&s;t night to the hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, where a ma&s;s was held. The women continued the whole night in the chapel, in order to keep watch, or to commemorate the night in which our Saviour was betrayed. Their forty days lent fini&s;hed ye&s;terday,
<PB N="186" REF="027681_0184_0FD5DB19E2A216C0">
and this being the day on which they hold Chri&s;t was crucified, they eat no breakfa&s;t, although they have not ta&s;ted of meat in forty days, and the day is held very &s;olemn, with a general ma&s;s. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed by all who are &s;pectators to all their dif|ferent modes of wor&s;hiping, that no people can take more pains to go to heaven than they do; and as to their pinning their ceremonies on their &s;leeve, ac|cording to &s;ome ob&s;ervations, what is that to me, or another, &s;ince they are up and doing? They cer|tainly &s;hew more rationality in this, than in making no pretence towards devotion; and they will po&s;i|tively &s;ay, that it is their duty to wor&s;hip, and by &s;eriou&s;ly &s;erving God, and commemorating our Sa|viour's different pa&s;&s;ions whil&s;t on earth, they tru&s;t will finally be a means of making them happy.</P>
<P>For my part, it is not my intention to ever pro|fe&s;s the Roman Catholic religion, although I believe the fir&s;t foundation of it to have been a good in&s;titu|tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for in&s;tance, their commemorating our Saviour's different &s;cenes on earth, I think cannot be ami&s;s; though I find no &s;cripture to order it.

<P>Monday, April 1, 1782. This morning having &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Dunning, I de&s;cended pretty early to his quarters, and was &s;aluted by the family with a <HI>bone jure,</HI> or good morning. They a&s;ked me if we were going to tap our trees to day, in order to make &s;ugar? I an&s;wered in the affirmative; they replyed, that this and to-morrow were holy days to
<PB N="188" REF="027681_0186_0FD5DBBD2C664D70">
them, and that if we commenced working on either of the&s;e days, God would bla&s;t our undertakings. I expre&s;&s;ed to them our unwillingne&s;s to labor on their wor&s;hipping days, which I &s;hould deem as an in|fringement, provided we trouble them; but as we were urged by motives of nece&s;&s;ity, occa&s;ioned by our being pri&s;oners, and having no &s;upport except a common &s;oldier's ration, together with its being good weather, and the &s;ea&s;on far advanced, induced us to undertake the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k:&mdash;but all to no purpo&s;e. They in&s;i&s;ted that their prayers would gain us more &s;ugar if we delayed a few days. I an|&s;wered, that I believed both their prayers and reli|gion to be good, but as to looking for miracles in our nece&s;&s;ary callings, I could not be full in the faith. They &s;till per&s;i&s;ted, and recapitulated the many mi|racles God had wrought for them:&mdash;I told them it was a great ble&s;&s;ing if Providence was &s;o favorable in &s;uch extraordinary aids, and that neither the Ro|man Catholics nor Prote&s;tants had a right to doubt of his goodne&s;s; but on the religious part, I profe&s;&s;|ed we did not look for miracles; and that if my me|mory &s;erved, that they had met with in&s;tances of di&s;appointments, for they could not kill nor drive a|way the gra&s;shoppers and other in&s;ects the two la&s;t &s;ummers. The old lady was about leaving her bed when &s;he &s;prang up in a great rage, and we had the whole family to encounter, the wife, hu&s;band, daugh|ters, &amp;c&punc; but I like a great &s;oldier, kept the field, and heard their harrangues, which was a loud <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">clat upon this and that miracle; and recapitulated more than ever they or I &s;hall know. The old woman appeared the mo&s;t in earne&s;t, and after her whi&s;tling pipe was nearly expended, &s;he ran to Dunning, and in a low and faultering voice, &s;aid&mdash;"Mon&s;ieur Dunning, if you will believe me, if our old prie&s;t

<P>Sabbath, April 21. The face of nature once more begins to re&s;ume an agreeable a&s;pect. The earth, our ancient and fir&s;t mother, again makes her appearance, after having been &s;mothered for nearly &s;even months in &s;now. I cannot but ob&s;erve how rejoiced every thing in this country appear at the departure of &s;o large a bulk of &s;now. The lowing of cattle, return of birds, &amp;c. all &s;eem to join in one univer&s;al choir, to welcome the beauties of the earth, which I was never &s;o &s;en&s;ible of as &s;ince liv|ing in this country. This globe, interwoven as it is with hills, dales, rivulets, and the inter&s;per&s;ion of land&s;capes, with the variety of colours, all pre&s;ent|ing to view, is &s;omething grand and plea&s;ing, and be&s;peaks a great forming hand. The old philo&s;o|phers &s;eemed to vie with each other who &s;hould mo&s;t extal the grandeur and plea&s;antne&s;s of this immen&s;e globe, and were willing to return to her again. Xenophon, in de&s;cribing the life of his prince as a pattern of good nature and charity in all his differ|ent &s;cenes of life, de&s;cribes him, even on his death bed, as being plea&s;ed with the reflection, that while the &s;oul returned to him who made it, his body would incorporate with the great mother of all things, and by that means become beneficial to man|kind, for which rea&s;ons he gave his &s;ons po&s;itive or|ders

He is a droll man, is from Old France, and warmly attached to the Briti&s;h crown; and his rea&s;ons for the favorable wi&s;hes he appears to have for that empire, &s;eems
<PB N="197" REF="027681_0195_0FD5DAFBA9686720">
grounded on a de&s;ire, that a balance of power may ever be kept up; and &s;ays he would be &s;orry to &s;ee one nation ri&s;e &s;uperior to another: but as all at pre&s;ent are balanced, he wi&s;hes that concordance may continue, and &s;eems apprehen&s;ive that if Ame|rica &s;hould be independent, the crown will lo&s;e that weight of balance which it ought to have; although he appears to have a de&s;ire that the Americans may not be en&s;laved, but may be &s;et on the &s;ame footing as before the war, which &s;entiment agrees with ab|&s;tracts from two letters intercepted, and which ap|peared in the Quebec Gazette, &s;aid to be written by Mr. Deane, in France; one was directed to his brother in Virginia, and the other to Major Tall-man, at General Wa&s;hington's head quarters, &s;et+ting forth him&s;elf to be much dejected on account of the conte&s;t with Great Britain, pointing out &s;o many difficulties, and the va&s;t expence it will occa|&s;ion &s;hould we become free and independent &s;tates. He urges that, in his opinion, we could make a peace with that crown honorable to our&s;elves, and advantageous to both England and America, and a firm e&s;tabli&s;hment to the prote&s;tant faith; but if England &s;hould be too far reduced, it would be dan|gerous not only to the liberties of America, but to her religion al&s;o. The date of the&s;e letters is "Pa|ris, May 20, 1781." I do not believe the copy is genuine; but I fear &s;ome remarks relative to the prote&s;tant religion may, in ca&s;e England &s;hould be reduced, prove too true; as the Canadians make no &s;cruple of telling us, that if France reduces Eng|land, they will make them and the Americans be|come Roman Catholics. Mr. Duran &s;ays, that he does not think it right to per&s;ecute people for their religious &s;entiments, and he thinks the Prote&s;tants can go to heaven as well as the Catholics; but &s;ays
<PB N="198" REF="027681_0196_0FD5DAEA69114A58">
the Prote&s;tant clergy have a much ea&s;ier way: they marry and have families, and pray now and then:&mdash;but the Roman Catholic prie&s;ts cannot marry; they mu&s;t ri&s;e every morning and attend to prayers until nine o'clock, and then confe&s;s the people till twelve, and from two until five; and then to ma&s;s at &s;even con&s;tantly. Indeed I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I never &s;aw any man &s;o faithful in prayer as the one I am now writing of. He ri&s;es exactly at &s;ix in the morn|ing, in winter and &s;ummer (as I have often pa&s;&s;ed by the church in the &s;ummer, and always heard the bell ring at &s;ix, and never failed of finding him at prayer.) Sometimes he walks back and forth bye the meeting hou&s;e, when there are not people to at|tend prayers; and I fully believe, if the king of France was to pa&s;s him in his devotion, he would not appear to take any notice of him. Indeed he &s;ays, that if the king goes bye when they are at prayer, he takes his hat off, or if he even pa&s;&s;es a church, &s;mall chapel, or cro&s;s; and I never &s;aw any, from the grey head to the youth, pa&s;s a meeting hou&s;e, cro&s;s, or the like, but they walk with their hats off, and put up a &s;hort prayer. I was once in a boat in the river St. Lawrence, with &s;everal Ca|nadians, who, on pa&s;&s;ing a church, all went to prayer. How far this is right let every one judge.</P>
<P>How natural it is for the mind to be anxious a|bout the cares of this world! And indeed we are &s;ent into it to act our part upon the great theatrical &s;tage, and if we do not perform our temporary, as well as &s;piritual, warfare aright, we fall &s;hort of acting with propriety that part for which we were de&s;igned. I have often reflections about my two poor little chil|dren whom I left in infancy: but they are under the guidance of a guardian God. Still it is nece&s;&s;ary and right that they &s;hould be educated, which I tru&s;t

Some are ha&s;tening into being, and &s;ome are ha&s;ten|ing to be no more, on earth. The&s;e changes renew the world, and ever pre&s;ent new parts of the infinite eternity that lies before us; therefore, what is there in this rolling tide, which is con&s;tantly flowing and ebbing, worthy of our attachment, any more than if we &s;hould grow fond of a &s;parrow flying?

<P>May 15. I read the king's &s;peech of the 27th of November la&s;t, in which he gives information to his parliament of the lo&s;s of his army in Virginia, which he &s;ays calls loudly for a more &s;pirited exertion in or|der to re&s;tore peace to his deluded &s;ubjects. Poor man! he has not been the in&s;trument of cau&s;ing blood enough to be &s;hed as yet, particularly on our frontiers; and yet is very unwilling to burthen his &s;ubjects with new taxes. I cannot believe the Brit|i&s;h empire will ever pro&s;per for their cruel and &s;a|vage treatment to the Americans; and I &s;hould not wonder if, at &s;ome future day, the judgments we now undergo from their oppre&s;&s;ion &s;hould fall on their own heads; and what&s;oever mea&s;ures they meet, &s;hould be mea&s;ured to them again, although they may have no Indians to fear: but I pray that &s;omething re&s;embling them may &s;courge tho&s;e who have been the in&s;truments of &s;courging us. I view the United States as a free and independent empire, although further pretended Briti&s;h exertions are threatened, in order to reduce us to obedience; and the language of the hardy Britons, cry aloud that it mu&s;t be &s;o. I can hear nothing but that the obedi|ence

<P>16th. A man came from Quebec this morning for Newcomb Blodget, our waiter, who is exchanged, and we received letters from Mr. Murray inform|ing

<P>21&s;t. We wrote a petition to Congre&s;s, inform|ing them of our di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;etting forth that of|ficers from the continental army, being captive in a &s;trange land, were not a little chagrined to find them&s;elves &s;o reduced and neglected by their coun|try, as to be obliged to cut wood for the Canadians at twenty-four coppers a cord (which is one &s;hilling Halifax) and expo&s;ed to in&s;ult from every Briti&s;h up&s;tart, and a&s;ked if we are not a&s;hamed to &s;erve &s;uch a body of men.

<P>Saturday, 25th. This day my land-lady's mother died, after a &s;trange and lingering di&s;order, which very much prevails in this country, and generally proves fatal, particularly to the aged.

I frequently, from the friend&s;hip I had for Mrs. Jaun&s;eling, went to &s;ee the old lady, and on one of my vi&s;its, the mini&s;ter from St. John's was there; he appeared a genteel, well bred gentleman, and as far as I could under&s;tand the language, &s;poke to her with great &s;olemnity and &s;en&s;e on her la&s;t end; and told her to continue &s;tedfa&s;t in prayer to God, and that through the merits of Chri&s;t and the interce&s;&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tles and the Virgin Ma|ry, he was in hopes &s;he would meet with a free par|don of all her &s;ins; &s;he received the &s;acrament with devoutne&s;s of heart, to appearance, and when &s;he di|ed, appeared &s;en&s;ible and compo&s;ed. There was a|bout twenty people in the room, who continued on their knees in prayer I believe better than an hour, &amp; as her la&s;t breath went out of her they aro&s;e &amp; &s;prin|kled holy water on the corp&s;e, which was immediately &s;ewed up in a &s;heet, and the face never more &s;een. Whatever hath been &s;aid of the Roman Catholic's, I cannot condemn them for one thing, as they always appear joyful if any of us prote&s;tants attended ma&s;s or their funerals, and have never a&s;ked us to become Roman Catholic's.</P>
<P>May 26. A man arrived this morning from Quebec with a letter from Mr. Murray, to inform Mr. Dunning that he is exchanged&mdash;And about 12 o'clock he &s;et out. By him I wrote letters to my brother John Scudder, Jeremiah Van Ren&s;&s;alaer, and Doctor Woodruff, at Albany.

<P>Sabbath 7th. All of us who are pri&s;oners went this day to ma&s;s, where the young women as well as the old, were dre&s;&s;ed in &s;triped home&s;pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> petticoats and mocka&s;ins, in token of humility, by order of the prie&s;t, that the gra&s;shoppers may depart; but it &s;eems to enrage them; they have eat all my young onions off;&mdash;they will towards evening gather &s;o thick in the fields of wheat, that the &s;talks look fairly black; and they begin to eat the ears that are ju&s;t putting out. It is really a melancholy &s;ight.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 9th. All are gone to ma&s;s to make a proce&s;&s;ion, old and young. The women go without &s;tockings and mocka&s;ins, in token of mourning for the calamities in their land.</P>
<P>Monday 15th. This morning I had a patient to vi&s;it at&punc; St. John's, and on my way met about fifty Engli&s;h &s;ailors who were going to unload a large &s;hip that is ca&s;t away oppo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> where I live; her cargo is provi&s;ions for government<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Thur&s;day 10th. I wont to a vendue this day where the owner of the goods bought almo&s;t the whole, or bid for them in public, which was the man of the hou&s;e; and however droll it may appear, it is the fa&s;hion of this country, if a man lo&s;es his wife and has children, he is obliged to &s;ell his moveables, and give one half to the children, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s the ca&s;e at the pre&s;ent vendue. The wind has blown from the &s;outh-we&s;t for near two weeks con&s;tantly, during which time we have had no rain, and it being a con|&s;iderable drought, the gra&s;shoppers take the advan|tage, and eat the wheat; in &s;ome fields the ears ap|pear to be half de&s;troyed. What is voided from the in&s;ects, is as large as che&s;s, and as thick on the ground as wheat when fir&s;t &s;own; but no people appear more in earne&s;t in devotion that God would impede this judgment, than the&s;e people.

<P>Tue&s;day, July 23. This day is three years &s;ince being taken a pri&s;oner; and how far it may prove of pre&s;ent or future advantage, is hard for me to form the lea&s;t idea of; but from what former re|flections I have had and am &s;till impre&s;&s;ed with, I tru&s;t that the&s;e things will not be entirely lo&s;t. The fire may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be extingui&s;hed, but &s;ure|ly it will not be wholly forgotten, as I view pro&s;per|ity and adver&s;ity as proceeding from the bountiful giver or withholder, at his all Sovereign plea&s;ure, and we are entirely at his di&s;po&s;al, re&s;pecting cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, or rather adver&s;e and pro&s;pe|rous pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>July 25. Again I have lived to &s;ee another birth|day, which makes me thirty-five years of age; and I cannot omit reflecting on the vain u&s;e that is gene|rally

<P>Augu&s;t 1&s;t. Plea&s;ant agreeable weather. We catch plenty of pigeons, which are young and very fine, and have a tendency to a&s;&s;i&s;t us along the jour|ney of life, and may be numbered with thou&s;ands of ble&s;&s;ings which we receive and pa&s;s by without &s;carcely taking notice of.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 4th. Captain Smith received thirty dol|lars from his wife, which is the fir&s;t relief that has ever been &s;ent to the pri&s;oners from our country;

and poor Scudder is yet poor Scudder! Left in po|verty, and no friend to apply to, except my doctor|ing, which is &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but I am too poor a doctor to deceive the people, and they are too poor to pay if they were deceived.

<P>Augu&s;t 17th. Received a letter from Mr. Mur|ray, containing an an&s;wer to a letter I wrote to Gen. Clark, on account of the &s;toppage of the advance|ment of money to the pri&s;oners, in which I begged him to intercede for us; but all to no purpo&s;e. He informed Mr. Murray, that he would not interfere with the General in our behalf, as he &s;uppo&s;es the Commander in Chief had &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for his conduct. It po&s;&s;itively appears, that all the boa&s;ted Briti&s;h humanity is fled; nor do I believe they ever were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that greatne&s;s of &s;oul that has been repre&s;ented, though we were taught &s;o to believe&mdash;but &s;urely we have learned another le&s;&s;on: for in|&s;tance, the treatment to the pri&s;oners taken at Fort Wa&s;hington, who were frozen and &s;tarved to death in Sugar Hou&s;es, cold Jails, and thou&s;ands died on board of pri&s;on &s;hips:&mdash;but let them go on; I am proof again&s;t any further attack, as I have lain in jail until my con&s;titution is ruined, and they may now tyrannize, for I &s;corn them from my inmo&s;t &s;oul, and

<P>Tue&s;day, 20th. From the &s;mall &s;tock of money I have been able to collect, I have purcha&s;ed a gal|lon of red wine to make a trial for relief from the di&s;order I have &s;o long been afflicted with in my bow|els. I almo&s;t di&s;pair of ever recovering; but if I had ever &s;o good a &s;tate of health, at la&s;t I mu&s;t die.

<P>Saturday, Augu&s;t 24, 1782. My being particu|lar to the day, month and year, is, that la&s;t evening Col. James Gordon, Lieutenant White, Lieutenant Banter, and En&s;ign Banter, made their e&s;cape, or de&s;erted. We &s;uppo&s;e it was a matter which had for &s;ome time been under con&s;ideration. At any rate they are gone, and we &s;uppo&s;e have broke their paroles, and embarked down the river.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, 27th. La&s;t night a man came from Quebec, with a letter to inform Captain Smith he is exchanged, and this morning he &s;at off for home. In him I have lo&s;t, I believe, a &s;incere friend, a good companion, and a man of &s;en&s;e. His company was agreeable, of a merry turn, but very &s;triking on &s;e|rious &s;ubjects; his rea&s;onings are improving and agreeable. Farewel my good friend, may you live comfortably the remaining days you may have left, die in peace, and leave a ble&s;s|ing behind you, whil&s;t my little barque glides &s;lowly after; and may we both enter into re&s;t (which is a thought too great for frail mortals to dwell on) but &s;uch we are told will happen to tho&s;e who earn|e&s;tly &s;eek aright, and the prize is &s;o great, who would not ha&s;ten to be an adventurer? It is a fair and no|ble chance, and there is nothing in this life worthy

of our anxiety or cares. It is a troubled ocean at be&s;t, and tho&s;e who have landed &s;afe upon the fron|tiers of our Great Emanuel, are ble&s;&s;ed un&s;peakably indeed. I am left alone, not a per&s;on who can &s;peak Engli&s;h, but all are Canadians, and I &s;peak &s;uch poor French, that it is hard to talk with them, but I will wait with calmne&s;s, not forgetting that he who reliev|eth captive pri&s;oners, will al&s;o deliver me from this con|fined &s;tate, at his gracious will. The time is fa&s;t approaching, when all the&s;e different changing &s;cenes in life will lie down and be forgotten; although I hold that the &s;oul does not lo&s;e the thought of the tribulated &s;tage it has pa&s;&s;ed through, as it is rea&s;on|able that no part of annihilation can take place after the &s;oul leaves the body. For in&s;tance, when the &s;oul is lo&s;t and forever mi&s;erable, that which creates and makes the mi&s;ery, is the reflection of having mi&s;pent the opportunities which were offered whil&s;t here on earth and a guilty con&s;cience makes a hell, mi&s;erable far beyond human conception; therefore, &s;hould any part of annihilation take place, or the &s;oul forget its being on earth and mi&s;u&s;ing the&s;e op|portunities, it would be ignorant of what it was pun|i&s;hed for. It is ju&s;t the &s;ame with tho&s;e who die happy; for the &s;cripture &s;ays, that tho&s;e who thro' many tribulations are clothed in white, &s;o the thought of pa&s;&s;ing through a tempe&s;tuous life, in pains, &s;ick|ne&s;&s;es, trials and temptations, all add to fill the mind with expan&s;ive views, beyond the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">each of a finite mortal to form an idea of. The joys and boundle&s;s pro&s;pects of a cele&s;tial a va&s;t infinity of eternity, o|pening more capacious than imagination can con|ceive; the &s;tring can hardly be touched upon, when hallelujahs will reign, forever and forever.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, 29th. Received a letter from Mr. Murray, advi&s;ing me to make my&s;elf contented for a

little time longer, for he expects I will in a &s;hort time be exchanged. But if not, the General will permit me to return to the &s;tates of America, on pa|role. Such news revives my mind, to think I &s;hall once more &s;ee my native country, which I &s;incerely de&s;ire, and that before cold weather, as it very much affects my health, the climate being too frigid. What a noble temper and di&s;po&s;ition a man mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of who, under all difficulties and trials, ne|ver &s;uffers the mind to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">led or di&s;compo&s;ed; but puts on the capacities of a man of fortitude, and &s;purns at trifles that are incident to human nature; &s;incerely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oaring higher and having loftier views than what tends to frail du&s;t, remembering that he is an adventurer for another world, and that if the road is filled with thorns, let them appear like flow|ers, con&s;idering our crown is at &s;take, and if we re|ceive mercy, no thought can reach the &s;malle&s;t chord of the bli&s;s which will compleat our happine&s;s to all eternity. Therefore what is there in this life that we would not cheerfully &s;ubmit to, that comes from &s;o righteous a providence, who &s;pared not his only &s;on, but &s;uffered him to wear a crown of thorns and die an ignominious death for man who is filled with ingratitude.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 3d. This day we had a violent &s;torm from the northea&s;t, or up the river. The wind blew a hurricane, attended with thunder. The people of the hou&s;e were fearful it would blow down. The woman brought out her hemlock boughs which had been con&s;ecrated at church, and threw them in|to the fire; &s;ome holy water was al&s;o brought, to &s;prinkle with, and they then all fell on their knees to prayer, and appeared very fervent; but the &s;torm &s;eemed to encrea&s;e. I expected the roof of the hou&s;e at lea&s;t would have gone, and felt under great
<PB N="220" REF="027681_0216_0FD5DBEC742CFEA0">
apprehen&s;ions that all of us would lo&s;e our lives. In the mid&s;t of the &s;torm, the young woman who was the only child, about eighteen years of age, jumped from her prayers and flew to my arms for protection, crying aloud, Oh! Mon&s;ieur Scudder, guard me and pray for me; on which I an&s;wered that God was her guard, and it was, according to their belief, of no u&s;e for Prote&s;tants to pray. The old man and woman &s;prang up and &s;aid they did not doubt but God would hear a Prote&s;tant as &s;oon as a Catholic. I told them that I made no doubt but he heard all nations or people that prayed &s;incerely, and I de&s;ired to join with them for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at the &s;ame time encouraging them not to be afraid, for that we were in his hands, and made no doubt but the wind would &s;oon abate; &s;till I had, for near an hour, a hard &s;truggle to keep the young woman from going into fits. Happily at la&s;t the &s;torm a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ated, and the father and mother &s;eemed to regard me for my encouragement to them and their daugh|ter, &amp;now &s;uppo&s;e the Prote&s;tants may go to heaven. I have often mentioned the Roman Catholics in this journal, and really to &s;ee them in any difficulty fly to the Supreme Being for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is a circum&s;tance worthy of attention, as there is &s;o rea&s;onable a de|mand from the Creator to the creature, that not to return our Parent and Maker a thankful heart, is placing us below the common brutes.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, 15th. I have for &s;ometime neglected putting any of my phy&s;ical proceedings down in this journal, in particular relating to the woman who lives near Montreal, on account of my mind being taken up with more &s;erious matters; but man is of a changeable di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o now proceed to put down &s;ome &s;ketches of my practice, lea&s;t it may be lo&s;t. In the fir&s;t place, as is my u&s;ual practice in al|mo&s;t
<PB N="221" REF="027681_0217_0FD5DBEC77EE7370">
every di&s;order, I hold her, and then prepared a bottle of good madeira, with the filings of &s;teel put therein, out of which two large phials were filled and the remainder left in the quart bottle; this is to a&s;|&s;i&s;t the blood, and indeed all nature. The decoction of cortex was put in two p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ials more, as a bracer; the acid of elixir to a&s;&s;i&s;t the appetite, and a phial of camphor to keep off the fever, with two phials of &s;trong bohea. Thus were almo&s;t all my phials filled, and my patient's room looked like a &s;mall apotheca|ry's &s;hop. The rea&s;on of this was, I expected &s;he was rich, and there was ca&s;h to be had. An i&s;&s;ue was al&s;o ordered, and the whole conducted with judgment: and I find my patient is no wor&s;e, nor indeed much better; however, &s;he is not very &s;ick. Her father generally takes me out in a hor&s;e cart, and when I get on my three &s;quare hat, (for mode&s;|ty's &s;ake I mu&s;t not &s;ay a cocked hat) I &s;ay when this hat is put on my head, the brim of it being large, (which was allowed through the clemency of Bri|tannia's generalli&s;&s;imo of this province) and I placed along &s;ide of my old friend in the hor&s;e-cart, we draw the attention of a great many &s;pectators, particularly the dogs; for the rattling of the cart and a trail of dogs which never e&s;cape us (as they &s;eem to know our &s;ound) with their yelling and bowwowing, one dog bringing out another, and thus we are acco&s;ted for four miles&punc; together, which with our gibberage, when we can be heard, all contribute to make a jargon not ea&s;ily under&s;tood. One thing is very extraordinary, and that is&mdash;how the&s;e dogs &s;hould take &s;o much notice of me, being an entire &s;tranger to them, but knowing the &s;agacity of tho&s;e animals, they often &s;tir up my jealou&s;y, &s;or I am like the world of mankind who are more or le&s;s jealous, in particular if they undertake what they are unac|quainted

with. So my feelings are worked up, and I am &s;ometimes inclined to believe that they think as I think, that I am no doctor; or why &s;hould they make &s;uch a plaguy rout every time I go, and &s;eem to let me return in peace. However I di&s;regard what they &s;ay, knowing dogs to be dogs, although in this ca&s;e they are cunning dogs.&mdash;I have al&s;o been called on to bleed the old Prie&s;t's hou&s;e-keeper, and went a &s;abbath morning, expecting to bleed her and then go to ma&s;s, but was rather later than I expect|ed, and met the par&s;on going to church, who thus acco&s;ted me, <HI>bone jure Mon&s;ieur Scudder?</HI> (how do you do Mr. Scudder) are you going to bleed the young woman? I an&s;wered I was. He &s;hook his head, and &s;aid no pau po&s;&s;ible&mdash;I a&s;ked why? He &s;aid &s;he was too gro&s;s, and no doctor or per&s;on bad or could ever bleed her. I &s;aid that perhaps &s;he never had tried a Bo&s;tonian &s;urgeon. He replied no. I then laugh|ed at him, and told him the Bo&s;tonians always went through with what they undertook. It may be was his an&s;wer. I then proceeded to the hou&s;e where my great lu&s;ty patient was &s;itting with her feet in warm water; &s;he was as heavy as two of the old prie&s;t put together. I a&s;ked her if &s;he meant to be bled in the foot? She an&s;wered in the affirmative, and I proceeded to tie up her leg; but no more of a vein appeared, than on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">her moc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;in; I tied up her arm, but to no purpo&s;e. At la&s;t I perceived a vein appeared full ju&s;t back of her toes, near the fore one, and ventured to put the lancet in, which made her bleed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reely; I &s;toped it without much difficulty, which not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inally contributed to rai&s;e my fame. In &s;hort, my lancet, and now and then a ca|thartic, with this and that which I hobble through with, gets me a con&s;iderable income of late, and it really begins to flatter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e that I am &s;omewhat&punc; of
<PB N="223" REF="027681_0219_0FD5DBF16E92AB20">
a &s;urgeon or doctor; and the&s;e flatteries will remain until I am put to the te&s;t, and then what a figure I &s;hall cut, like a quack as I am! But one thing is certain, and this certain thing is, that I am not the only quack that practices in America, or Europe; for many pretended doctors are quacks, and many trumped up prie&s;ts are quacks, &s;ome merchants, attor|nies &amp; mechanics are quacks; farmers, &s;hip-builders, boat builders, &s;cow-builders, balloon-builders, &s;team-boat builders, nay my memory will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rve, nor paper admit, neither can I enumerate the quacks: There|fore, my advice from experience is, to all manner of per&s;ons, friends or foes, never to undertake, a piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, particularly when difficulty attends, without having a thorough knowledge of what they are about to undertake, except in my &s;ituation; for I mu&s;t plead my own cau&s;e. I do not mean here to ca&s;t any reflections, but only to advi&s;e; for the more regular or experienced per&s;ons are in their lawful avocations; the more u&s;eful they can be in their call|ings; and it cannot be expected that a man who &s;erved two or three years can be equal in knowledge and experience to tho&s;e who &s;erved &s;even. With regard to trumped up prie&s;ts, I look upon the bible to be of &s;o my&s;terious a nature, that the man who undertakes to open and explain tho&s;e &s;ublime truths which the &s;criptures are filled with, and be a teacher, ought to be a man who has education and a clear and good under&s;tanding. Some will pretend to go by the &s;pirit; but miracles are not wrought now a days; and it is either ignorance or &s;elf-delu&s;ion. However, I hold that the &s;pirit a&s;&s;i&s;ts&punc; all men; but no man can be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, only by the labour of the hands of mind, or el&s;e I might be a good doctor; for the &s;pirit is willing, but it is new to me, there|fore I cannot under&s;tand it, and cannot practice,

only through deception; and this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e with any branch, civil or religious, where they know but little of what they undertake.</P>

Mrs. Lebe was this morning de|livered of a fine &s;on, and as is common, it was this day carried to church, and baptized by the name of Michael; and what is &s;ingular, the parents never attend at the chri&s;tening of a child; only the God-father and God-mother.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s how to expre&s;s my acknowledgments to you for the kind favor of your letter of the 29th of Augu&s;t, but give me leave to a&s;&s;ure you, that I am filled with greatful &s;entiments for his Excellency's and your kind favor towards me, and flatter my&s;elf, if I &s;hould not meet with an exchange, that if his Excellency &s;hould admit me on parole, he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e fully convinced I &s;hall not vary from the line of true honor. As I have a feeling for the long captivated pri&s;oners taken from the regiment to which I belong, I &s;hould e&s;teem it a particular favor, if I &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to have my parole, that they might be indulged to go with me, as &s;everal of them have families, and I will pledge my faith they will not act again&s;t his Britannic Maje&s;ty or his government, until they &s;hall be properly exchanged. Permit me to further ob&s;erve, (if there is a meditation of my being permitted on parole) that the frigid &s;ea&s;on of the year is fa&s;t approaching, and my health much impaired, together with a want of more cloathing, I mu&s;t therefore earne&s;tly reque&s;t, that I may be &s;ent from this place before the weather proves very tedious.</P>

September 23. This day arrived nine pri&s;oners to live in this pari&s;h, on parole. Their names and places as follow:</P>
<P>Charles Creecraft, Major of militia, from Virgi|nia, taken Augu&s;t 21, 1781.</P>

<P>September 24. The man who took my letter to Quebec, has returned without an an&s;wer, Mr. Mur|ray being in the country. I am as u&s;ual di&s;appoint|ed, and among&s;t &s;o many di&s;appointments in life, can it be po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hall be di&s;appointed when death comes, which will make but one event in the whole of all tho&s;e different vici&s;&s;itudes, and that e|vent will put an end to all the temporary, mi&s;taken, and flattering ideas of this frail and tran&s;itory &s;tage, which is full of actions and perplexities, and di&s;quiets us in vain; for the whole of all the&s;e di&s;quietudes are as a &s;park, or a moment to an endle&s;s duration.&mdash;Mournful thought! that man, poor frail du&s;t, &s;hould be unhappy after leaving this lodgment of clay, who&s;e better part has wandered from its God,

<P>September 29. My phy&s;ical finances being rather too low for the relief of all my brother officers, we concluded all hands to cut wood for one day, at the extravagant&punc; wages of thirty &s;ous per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cord; and having our weapons well &s;harpened, repaired to the woods bet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nes in the morning; and each man took his po&s;t, which occa&s;ioned &s;uch a cracking, tumbling and thra&s;hing among&s;t the trees, and even &s;miting them after they were down, that the Phy&s;ician &s;ometimes thought him&s;elf in danger, in particular he had to &s;tand at a di&s;tance from his Major, who&s;e carca&s;e was &s;ix feet &s;ix inches in heighth, with very exten&s;ive arms; &s;o that when his axe was fully ex|tended in the air, it was eight feet five inches and an half from the &s;olid ground, and every &s;troke counted one. He had al&s;o one other advantage o|ver his men, which is nece&s;&s;ary for all field-officers, he had not much occa&s;ion of making many &s;teps to fini&s;h trimming his tree. In &s;hort the on&s;et was pu&s;hed with re&s;olution by all, and in every quarter until, high meridian, when a halt was made for din|ner, at which time it was di&s;covered that many wounds were received in the hands; however, be|ing to a man commi&s;&s;ioned officers, we &s;tood bravely until the &s;etting &s;un, when we found our&s;elves po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;even cord of wood, completely heaped and mea&s;ured for the Canadians, and the day following received the whole of the ca&s;h, which we immedi|ately &s;ent to Quebec, where every farthing was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid out for ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, tea, &s;ugar, and &s;undry articles too tedious to mention.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="027681_0224_0FD5DBFACC56EB98">
October 1&s;t. Our goods arrived this day at ten o'clock, amounting in the whole to fourteen &s;hil|lings worth (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alifax money, at five &s;hillings for each rix dollar,) and among &s;aid arrivals, were for each of us, two &s;tout &s;temmed large bowled pipes, built much in the form of the Canadians, or their hor&s;es, being peculiarly clum&s;y, the &s;tem &s;ix inches in length, and the bowl about one inch in diameter, and of con&s;equence they &s;eldom needed charging, which was an advantage to men of indu&s;try. Our rum was not &s;o clo&s;ely in&s;pected into, being thir&s;ty for that kind of liquid, occa&s;ioned us, as in all other ca&s;es where love is at the bottom, to overlook &s;ome of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad qualities. We all a&s;&s;embled together at one place, which was no other than the doctor's quarters, and took dinner, when our liquor, pipes and tobacco &s;moked for it. The remaining part of our &s;tores were equally divided, and about the &s;etting &s;un, every man to his quarters.</P>
<P>October 2d. A droll circum&s;tance happened la&s;t night to one of my brother officers; I &s;uppo&s;e he was &s;omething thir&s;ty in the evening, and drank a di&s;h of &s;trong tea, which made him vapory. He imagined the hou&s;e was in flames, and bawled and hallowed &s;o loud that the man of the hou&s;e had to run for the &s;urgeon. He told me in French that the Bo&s;tonian had lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es&mdash;I immediately &s;at out in ha&s;te to his lodgings, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound the poor man almo&s;t frightened to death. He told me he was dying, for that &s;treaks of fire were flying out of his eyes, and images continually appearing; and not being able to &s;peak a word of French, their appear|ed a general fright and jargon in the whole family; however, I &s;oon found out the nature of his com|plaint: for the old lady informed me &s;he had made him &s;ome tea after he was in bed, and that &s;he put a
<PB N="229" REF="027681_0225_0FD5DBFCB81869A0">
handful of tea in the mug, and the man &s;oon went crazy. I mentioned the circum&s;tance to him&mdash;gave him &s;ome water, and on the whole made a cure of the patient. I received a letter from Capt. Smith, mentioning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had arrived at a place called Ca&s;&s;elton, on our Ea&s;tern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rontiers, and that peace was in a fair way of taking place. On the whole great encouragement is given to me of being &s;oon &s;ent home.</P>
<P>October 4th. This day came to this place Mr. Aaron Purbeck, a &s;econd Lieutenant, belonging to the &s;hip Di&s;patch, which was taken by the frigate Pandora. He was three weeks from Salem when captured, and has been pri&s;oner &s;ix weeks. His crew has gone home, and him&s;elf detained as an ho&s;|tage. The di&s;patch mounted twelve guns, &s;ix and four pounders. The Pandora has in the cour&s;e of the war taken a number of our American ve&s;&s;els; but I believe the Captain has u&s;ed the pri&s;oners well. The &s;hip Hind of twenty-four guns, is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>October 6. My doctoring goes on as u&s;ual, al|though I have lately lo&s;t a patient, who died of age; therefore his life could not be further prolong|ed, notwith&s;tanding the judgmatical a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two eminent phy&s;icians. I am waiting with patience for a departure from this i&s;land of fortune, and of con|&s;equence collecting my debts, dues and demands, and have at this in&s;tant my phy&s;ical book before me, which I expect will at &s;ome period appear in this journal; at any rate it contains a number of <HI>Rhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> or a great many nothings, if their is &s;uch a thing as <HI>nothing.</HI> Upon the whole, was this very account &s;et up this day at &s;ale, I would not give more than thirty-&s;ix York &s;hillings for it, as I verlly believe that all tho&s;e who intended to pay me, have already done it: and to attempt the ri&s;k of a law-&s;uit would be
<PB N="230" REF="027681_0226_0FD5DBFDB696B370">
more whim&s;ical than my practice. Furthermore, &s;hould I attempt a law-&s;uit with my old cu&s;tomers, in the fir&s;t place, it would create anger; &s;econdly, my abilities might be called in que&s;tion; and thirdly, I &s;hould make a bad defence was that the ca&s;e. Therefore as a man of &s;kill, judgment and &s;ound &s;en&s;e, I think that &s;oft words, per&s;ua&s;ions, &amp;c. &amp;c. is by far the mo&s;t eligible, the mo&s;t peaceable, the mo&s;t harmonious, and to make &s;hort of this part of my bu&s;ine&s;s, the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive.</P>

<P>This account is the fir&s;t of my undertaking; and is not &s;o correct as after getting more u&s;ed to the prac|tice. However, it is a &s;pecimen, but in the long run, there is a great many Rheas, or nothings, as I am very rich and generous, and it is not common for the two to keep company. When I was a boy at &s;chool, I recollect a copy that was &s;et me as follow:</P>

When lands are gone and money &s;pent,</L>
<L>Then learning is mo&s;t excellent.</L>
<P>A proverb which is applicable to me at this time, particularly in the phy&s;ical line.</P>
<P>October 10. The happy hour has arrived when we are to take our departure from the&s;e cold and frigid climes, as a letter has arrived this day at three o'clock, with orders for us to make ready to embark on board a &s;chooner, called the Mercury, for New-York, William Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eroc, commander. We all em|barked about &s;un-&s;et, and lay at anchor that night. In the morning early we fell down the river to Paul's Bay, and took on board the pri&s;oners who were there and &s;ailed to the i&s;land called Beck, where a fleet lay bound to New-York, at which place we arrived the next morning. The wind blew heavy with a rough &s;ea. The pri&s;oners and &s;ome of the &s;eamen were very &s;ea &s;ick. The Captain had a cat that had kittens, which he &s;aid had &s;ailed with him in the &s;hip Hind, which was lo&s;t, for &s;everal years, and in the height of the &s;well, the ve&s;&s;el being &s;mall and rolling very much, the poor cat took &s;ick, and in a|bout two hours died. The Captain appeared to lament her death far beyond what I have &s;een in a parent for the lo&s;s of a child. The cat acted by reaching and puking like a per&s;on &s;ea-&s;ick. Whe|ther the creature was &s;ea-&s;ick or not, is unknown to me; but I believe that was that occa&s;ioned her death; and I would not admit this remark in my journal if I could not prove it by credible witne&s;&s;es. It was al&s;o the Captain's opinion that the &s;well made her &s;ick.</P>
<P>About &s;un-&s;et the wind abated, but a heavy &s;ea continued. We were divided and put on board of different ve&s;&s;els. My lot was to go in the Lady Town&s;end, a large &s;hip pierced for 64 guns, and
<PB N="232" REF="027681_0228_0FD5DC00AAD3B6F0">
had been a Spani&s;h galeon of eleven hundred tons. The weather was cold and &s;tormy. After I had been on board for &s;ome time, walking on the quar|ter-deck, the &s;econd mate came and ordered me off, and &s;aid no one walked there but gentlemen&mdash;I in|formed him of my rank in the American army, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to &s;peak with the Captain, who&s;e name is Auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r. He informed the Captain of it, and I was ordered into the cabin. The Captain a&s;ked me what I wanted? I told him that I was a pri&s;oner of war on board his &s;hip, and mentioned my rank in the American army&mdash;that I had been near an hour on board, expo&s;ed to the cold and rain, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o notice had been taken of me, except that &s;ome man had ordered me from the quarter-deck, and &s;aid gentlemen walked there; I therefore wi&s;hed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">now the place a&s;&s;igned me in the &s;hip, as my &s;itua|tion was uncomfortable, and my clothes were wet. He had a number of clerks writing at his table, and appeared to be very attentive to them, without making any reply for &s;ome time; at la&s;t he called to his &s;econd mate, and told him to take me out of the cabin, for he was not going to be troubled by per|&s;ons in rebellion again&s;t their Sovereign, and that if I danced, I mu&s;t pay the fidd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er, or words to that ef|fect. However, I &s;till &s;tood warming my&s;elf, when the mate &s;aid, "&s;irrah don't you mind what is &s;aid?" I replied I was warming my&s;elf. The Captain walked with importance two or three times back and forward on the cabin floor, and then &s;aid to me, "Sir, do you intend to obey my orders?" I an&s;wer|ed&mdash;"yes; but by all the &s;hips that the &s;overeign you talk of owns, your ma&s;ter, Sir Guy Carlton, &s;hall know every tittle of your treatment to me,"&mdash;and walked out of the cabbin. I was conducted by the &s;econd mate to a little birth where not more
<PB N="233" REF="027681_0229_0FD5DC07A7F84108">
than two or three could &s;it, and received a &s;evere reprimand from the Crony; but I told him&mdash;"Sir, abu&s;e me on your peril." He a&s;ked me who I was? I told him his ma&s;ter &s;hould know who he was as &s;oon as I arrived at New-York; on which he took a more minute &s;urvey of me, and walked off. The fir&s;t Lieutenant or mate, was truly a gentleman: he brought me &s;ome refre&s;hment, and &s;aid I mu&s;t not think much of my treatment, as the Captain had ro&s;e from a boat&s;wain to his pre&s;ent rank, and that he treated him more like a &s;cullion than a mate. I had &s;ome canva&s;s to &s;leep on; but being wet and having no fire, lay cold that night. The next morning I re&s;umed my quarter-deck walk, to the no &s;mall mortification of the &s;econd mate, who was a proper likene&s;s in temper and politene&s;s to his Cap|tain, In about an hour the noble Captain appeared on the deck, and walked on one &s;ide and my&s;elf on the other; after &s;ome time he was called to break|fa&s;t. After breakfa&s;t he came on deck and re&s;umed his walk for &s;ome time, and at la&s;t &s;aid to me&mdash;"go into the cabin and take &s;ome coffee, my boys are now at breakfa&s;t." I an&s;wered, "damn you and your cabin, if ever I put my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oot in it to eat or drink with a man who has treated me in &s;o cruel a manner&mdash;And to a&s;k me to eat with your boys! But remember Captain, I &s;hall not always be under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our clutches, and if ever I arrive at New-York, I will acquaint Sir Guy Carlton, and the Commodore of this fleet with the u&s;age I have received. I am a pri&s;oner of war, and well know that the Briti&s;h offi|cers who are pri&s;oners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mong us, are treated like gentlemen. A few words more pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>We lay at anchor by Beck, until the 19th in&s;tant. The Captain and my&s;elf had no conver&s;ation to|gether; but I me&s;&s;ed with the mates of the &s;hip.
<PB N="234" REF="027681_0230_0FD5DC090E687DE8">
The &s;econd mate appeared more pliable; however, I &s;aid but little to him, having others to talk with that appeared more agreeable. During our &s;tay, the &s;now fell half leg deep, and the weather was cold like winter in Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>On the 19th, we all weighed anchor and &s;tood down the river with a fre&s;h breeze, keeping the &s;outh &s;hore in &s;ight, but &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of land on the north-ea&s;t and ea&s;t. Nothing material hap|pened on our pa&s;&s;age. We &s;aw an American &s;ail that appeared a fine &s;tout &s;hip, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be an American frigate, but &s;he out-run our &s;hip, which was the fa&s;te&s;t &s;ailing ve&s;&s;el in the fleet&mdash;The Pandora al&s;o gave cha&s;e, but to no purpo&s;e; we had to return to the fleet, greatly to the di&s;appoint|ment of my beloved Captain, who appeared very whi&s;t until he found &s;he out-went us, and then &s;ought manfully at the &s;ight of the rebel's top-ma&s;ts. I imagine we were oppo&s;ite Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, on the di&s;covery of the ve&s;&s;el, which was to the leeward, and on &s;ight of us hauled her wind, &s;o that before &s;he bore away we could di&s;cover her hull and hands at work; but our &s;hip was large, and three frigates in company, it was prudent for her to &s;tand off. We di&s;covered her about ten in the morning, and made every rag of &s;ail that could be put on, and by &s;un-&s;et he &s;hip was out of &s;ight, except her top-ma&s;ts, which lea&s;ed <HI>Scudder.</HI> We had a great deal of head <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inds, and was obliged to delay on account of a num|ber of dull &s;ailers, as the victualling &s;hips were chief|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y old colliers, built for burthen more than running. One poor man, a mate to one of the &s;hips, unfortu|nately fell overboard and was drowned, and I be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ieve no other accident happened. On the 13th of November, we arrived at New-York. But to re|turn to my noble Captain&mdash;the old &s;aying is, "give
<PB N="235" REF="027681_0231_0FD5DC0A844FF160">
Satan his due"&mdash;&s;o I will him; for as we drew on the coa&s;t of New-York, he appeared more &s;ociable, and actually, on a Sunday, a&s;ked the fir&s;t mate and my&s;elf to dine with him&mdash;We accordingly did; and if my memory &s;erves, I never knew the mate to dine with him at any other time; he al&s;o invited me into his cabin to drink &s;ome old brandy late at night, a heavy wind blowing and all hands on deck. I concluded a har&s;h promi&s;e was better broke than kept; &s;till on my arrival at New-York, had not a word to &s;peak of his favorable treatment, but men|tioned to &s;everal Captains of ve&s;&s;els whom I &s;aw one evening at Mrs. Banks's, his first treatment to me, and they to a man di&s;approved of it in the &s;tronge&s;t terms.</P>
<P>We continued on board the &s;hips until the 16th, during which time I was permitted &s;everal times to go on &s;hore, and the afternoon before we left town, the pri&s;oners were all put on board a cartel, ve&s;&s;el, and General Carlton, that good and humane man, &s;ent us two kegs of liquors, of ten gallons each, one of the be&s;t Madeira, and the other of &s;pirits. The next morning his aid-de-camp came to &s;ee if we wanted any thing, and to know what kind of treat|ment we had received in Canada and on our pa&s;&s;age; and herein I confe&s;s, that by experiencing &s;o great a contra&s;t to the u&s;age I had before received, and con|&s;idering we were at the eve of peace, made but a &s;hort reply, and &s;aid that I had &s;uffered by the rigid|ne&s;s of &s;ome; &s;till finding my&s;elf under the protec|tion of a man of &s;o much philanthropy, and about to embark once more for my native home, &s;hould &s;u&s;|pend any particular complaint. The evening be|fore, the pri&s;oners, on receiving their liquors, drank to Sir Guy Carlton, George Wa&s;hington and Con|gre&s;s, as loud as their voices could roar; and drank
<PB N="236" REF="027681_0232_0FD5DC0BEBA1B550">
bad luck, (or in wor&s;e words) to the tories, tho&s;e poor reptiles. About ten o'clock, we made &s;ail up the north river, and was treated by the Captain of the Cartel, with great politene&s;s; and what add|ed to our comfort, the General had given expre&s;s orders for us to have fre&s;h provi&s;ions and every ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us that was wanting. We lay that night about twenty miles from New-York, and the next day about noon arrived at Dobbs's Ferry, where I confe&s;s I hardly knew our troops, neither officers or &s;oldiers, as their regimentals were altered, and they had a fre&s;her countenance than what appeared either among the Engli&s;h or German troops, and were hardier &s;oldiers, to appearance. I confe&s;s that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to look at them with an impartial ob&s;ervation; but the Captain him&s;elf who com|manded the Cartel, &s;aid he never &s;aw finer looking men. I &s;at out afternoon for head-quarters, and arrived at New-Burgh that night, in a &s;loop; and the next day dined at head-quarters, from whence I went to camp, where I found my old brother officers and &s;oldiers hutting them&s;elves.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I &s;ent my Journal to you for publica|tion, I acknowledged by a letter, that it con|tained many imperfections, and that I felt the great|e&s;t diffidence in having it publi&s;hed to the eyes of (generally &s;peaking) a cen&s;orious world; but the rea&s;ons for the attempt were then &s;tated; and &s;ince I have &s;o far proceeded, I wi&s;h to make a few re|marks, which if judged admi&s;&s;ible, you will place at the end of the journal, that whoever &s;hall read may judge of their propriety or impropriety. At the commencement of the late memorable conte&s;t be|tween England and America, every true friend of liberty appeared to have a determination to be free, and from the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e, and the exertions of a brave and magnanimous people, with the aid of a kind Providence, we were brought to peace, liber|ty and independence, and now enjoy a mild, &s;afe and good government, every branch of which is e|lective, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t &s;tations. Add|ed to this, we are &s;ituated in a rich and fertile coun|try, having extended fore&s;ts, navigable rivers and &s;pacious harbours; our &s;ea-ports are crowded with ve&s;&s;els, wafted from the different ports of the globe, be&s;ides an exten&s;ive commerce of our own, with the fulle&s;t enjoyment of our &s;entiments, both civil and religious, and a &s;ituation happily remote from Eu|rope, that &s;eat of oppre&s;&s;ion, war and blood&s;hed:&mdash;all the&s;e are ble&s;&s;ings which con&s;pire to make us a happy people indeed. It only now remains for us to endeavor to improve the ble&s;&s;ings we have, and
<PB N="240" REF="027681_0235_0FD5DC145EFEFB78">
are daily receiving. And fir&s;t, we mu&s;t be guilty of the highe&s;t degree of ingratitude, if we do not one and all reverence and adore the Supreme Governor of the univer&s;e, for &s;o highly &s;ignalizing, us with peace and plenty, whil&s;t our friendly allies, the French are jeopardizing their lives and fortunes again&s;t de&s;potic powers, to obtain tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings we &s;o happily ac|compli&s;hed. It ought therefore, not only to excite the prayers of every well wi&s;her to the rights of man, for a ble&s;&s;ing on that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed nation, but eve|ry exertion &s;hould be made for their relief, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the United States.</P>
<P>Being thus &s;ettled under a well organized go|vernment, a due regard to our privileges is next in que&s;tion, &amp; merits a more &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion than I am able to give; but this far I may go&mdash;that to be at all times prepared for war is the most effectual me|thod to pre&s;erve peace, and prevent injury and in&s;ult, for which end a well di&s;ciplined militia, having a due regard to the laws both civil and military, is highly e&s;&s;ential. But notwith&s;tanding difference in &s;enti|ments may prevail, particularly on political topics, yet by the&s;e different opinions the ba&s;is of govern|ment is made more &s;ecure than if a torpidne&s;s pre|vailed; for it is a general maxim that all letharget|ic governments are always in danger; &s;till a certain medium &s;hould be ob&s;erved, and a particular caution not to proceed too far without being convinced a real danger does exi&s;t. Enquiries into the conduct of our rulers is right and rea&s;onable; it makes them more attentive to their duty, and good pilots will al|ways keep a good watch:&punc; and for the further &s;afety, to con&s;olidate a government, we &s;hould &s;trictly at|tend to the motto that appeared at the head of Mr. Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">'s Paper, at the commencement of the late war, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "United, we &s;tand, divided we fall."&mdash;
<PB N="241" REF="027681_0236_0FD5DC15A6283FE0">
Every per&s;on in the union &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf as belonging to a great family compact, and that it is his indi&s;pen&s;ible intere&s;t to &s;upport the &s;ame by be|ing a volunteer, and not a drudge, in &s;upporting the cau&s;e of his country; but what is conceived to be of the mo&s;t importance is the privilege of an elective government, which is, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, mo&s;t &s;hamefully neglected. A certain &s;upine&s;s and non-attendance on elections generally prevails, as if it were rather a &s;hame than an honor|able duty to attend, and time will make the neglect &s;till greater. Riches beget pride, and &s;ome think it not an honor to mix with the multitude in elections, not con&s;idering that their property is as much at &s;take as that of their fellow-citizens. Churches and elections are treated much alike, except &s;elf-in|tere&s;t, &s;uch as being appointed to public &s;tations, &amp;c. is the moving cau&s;e; nay, I have known &s;ome cha|racters to &s;coff at per&s;ons who appeared &s;pirited on &s;uch occa&s;ions as I deem of the utmo&s;t importance. Such neglect often gives room for clamorous charac|ters to become injurious to a government; &amp; on the contrary, when the ma&s;s of the people move in one body, a country is &s;afe. Therefore every free man of America who has a right to a vote, rich or poor, &s;hould be &s;trictly careful in attending to elections, as it has long been a common remark, that when the ma&s;s of the people collect for their &s;afety, they were &s;carcely ever known to err, provided the fulfilment of the laws of their country was their motive. By appointing worthy citizens to the head of govern|ment, and by a con&s;tant and uniform attendance on elections, it will become habitual, harmonious, and of con&s;equence the laws of the country cheerfully adhered to&punc; For in&s;tance, when the fir&s;t American Congre&s;s was cho&s;en, the people of America were
<PB N="242" REF="027681_0237_0FD5DC1725AC8030">
rou&s;ed from one end of the continent to the other, and almo&s;t every per&s;on flew to the election with a|lertne&s;s; and where, or when, was there ever a greater and wi&s;er &s;et of State&s;men collected in one body together? Their re&s;olves and names will be recorded to their honor, to the late&s;t po&s;terity. And does not our country at this day and at all times loudly call for wi&s;e and prudent &s;tate&s;men as leaders of the Republic.</P>
<P>Mankind are naturally of a re&s;tle&s;s make, and a republican form of government is an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to their ambition, as it is natural to a&s;pire to po&s;ts of honor, for which rea&s;on, an a&s;piring man in order to render him&s;elf con&s;picuous, will &s;ay&mdash;"neighbor, things does not go on right in government; our country is in danger"&mdash;and as the complaint increa&s;|es, the patient, who wi&s;hes to be cured by obtaining &s;ome honorable &s;tation, complains louder and louder. He rails again&s;t the Pre&s;ident of the United States, the Governor, and all in authority. This makes him a great man; for &s;urely &s;ays one, and &s;urely &s;ays another, this man mu&s;t know a great deal, or he would not talk in this manner, not con&s;idering that if they obtain their ends, others are left behind to make the &s;ame complaints. Therefore, I &s;ay again, a &s;trict attention to elections will prevent much jar|ing and di&s;cord&punc; as &s;uch ambitious, re&s;tle&s;s charac|ters would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;pi&s;ed, and men of prudence and integrity wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tand for the general good, would always meet with the public confidence. Every e|lector &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf a &s;tate&s;man, and &s;et too high a value on his vote to impart it to parties or tools, but con&s;ider well who he gives his &s;uffrage for, as I do pronounce every man who is inatten|tive to the duties he owes his country, a very u&s;ele&s;s organ, and his &s;trings, if &s;tretched, is &s;ound|ed

with murmurs and complaints. But what I deem the mo&s;t harmonious way of &s;upporting a republi|can government is, to act &s;ure. This may be thought an extraordinary remark; but what I judge the bulwark of this acting (and I am not alone) is to have a certain period of time fixed for the continu|ance in office of all public &s;ervants, from the Pre&s;i|dent to the members of the State Legi&s;latures, to be elective as they are at pre&s;ent, for as many years as the law may direct, and if thought proper, after a tain period, be again replaced. Such a rule once e|cer&s;tabli&s;hed, would become an ea&s;y cu&s;tom, and the per&s;on in office would know his de&s;tiny, and if he had conducted faithfully as a good &s;ervant, would yield up his po&s;t with plea&s;ure; and if he had not done his duty, it certainly would be proper to di&s;|place him.</P>
<P>I before ob&s;erved, that mankind are re&s;tle&s;s be|ings, and when a dignified office is filled by one per|&s;on for a long time without any limitation to his con|tinuance therein, rivalings and jarrings will appear, although the officer may be ever &s;o faithful; and where there is no end to the &s;aid officers being held up for his old &s;tation, he may be out-voted and di&s;|placed from office through calumnies, which exer|tions would not be &s;o &s;trenuous, was a certain peri|od &s;et. Be&s;ides a high &s;tation is ever courted, and ever envied; let the per&s;on's conduct be ever &s;o up|right, connections and parties will naturally ari&s;e, and it is a &s;tation or mark for the ob&s;ervation of e|very individual, and the admini&s;tration is attended with more or le&s;s complaints; therefore to relieve the per&s;on from &s;o tottering a po&s;t, let another take his place, and he who has been in office can be e|nabled to form a better judgement of the conduct of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or than any other per&s;on; and for general

tranquility a wide difference remains between a con|formity to law, or the &s;trength of intere&s;t in elections that has no end to its periodical progre&s;&s;ion. But it is argued, why &s;hould a man be put out of office, if he has behaved well, been long experienced in government, and a good old pilot? Nay, &s;ome will &s;ay the Empire or State would be in danger, was &s;uch an event to take place. I would a&s;k this &s;im|ple que&s;tion, what would become of &s;uch a govern|ment was the head thereof to die? I would wi&s;h to pay the highe&s;t re&s;pect to every per&s;on who has faithfully &s;erved his country, but this I am &s;ure of, that the lives of &s;uch are as uncertain as tho&s;e of all other montals; and I have not &s;o great an opinion of a mere man's being the &s;alvation of a country which has got to be an independent nation, where the whole body moves in one common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to be indulged with a few further remarks on our general privileges. Let us take a view of this happy land, which was fir&s;t &s;ettled by Europe an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> about the year &s;ixteen hundred and twenty, and was under but &s;mall cultivation in the year &s;even|teen hundred. The progre&s;s that has &s;ince been made in &s;o &s;hort a time, is unequalled; for at this day there is no country or nation in the world that has &s;o great a plenty of the nece&s;&s;aries of life as A|merica; the &s;ciences of every kind gain great per|fection, its laws both civil and religious, are &s;uch as become an independent and enlightened nation, each religious denomination attending divine &s;ervice in their own way, and as Harvey &s;ays, like &s;o many flowers, though of different colours, are all from the &s;ame &s;oil, The&s;e and many other advantages of a like kind are &s;o &s;triking, that no one can doubt the aid and protection of a great governing hand. I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve that the greate&s;t writer of his age

on the free government of nations (I mean Thomas Paine,) has directed his works, &s;tiled, "The Age of Rea&s;on," to the people of the United States of Ame|rica.</P>
<P>All due deference ought to be paid to this author for his writings at an early period of the late war. "Common Sen&s;e," "the Cri&s;is," &amp;c. demands the gratitude of America; but his Age of Rea&s;on, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the people of this country, contains a flat contradiction to the truths of the Bible, and in my opinion ought to be deemed an in&s;ult on our under|&s;tandings and government&mdash;He has, &s;ince his re&s;i|dence in Europe, confe&s;&s;ed that the United-States of America are a happy and free people, and that no per&s;on is under compul&s;ion as to religious wor&s;hip; but every one has a method of his own choo&s;ing: be&s;ides, he is &s;en&s;ible that from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country, no people could have been more li|beral in &s;entiment or more &s;pirited in dedicating hou&s;es of wor&s;hip to Almighty God in every part of this exten&s;ive continent. The civil and religious laws have gone hand in hand ever &s;ince its fir&s;t &s;et|tlement, and he mu&s;t be convinced that this country is a happy a&s;ylum for the oppre&s;&s;ed of all nations, remote from the jars, contentions and per&s;ecutions of de&s;potic powers. With the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions on his mind it was ill done to &s;trike at the foundation of our united exi&s;tence; for if the bible is all fabulous, and we have no way or mode pointed out to wor|&s;hip, our churches and church di&s;cipline will be an|nihilated and we become far inferior in poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of re|ligion to the Hottentots; for they are under an e|&s;tabli&s;hed form or method of wor&s;hipping, and indeed there is no nation under Heaven but acknowledge and adore a Supreme Being.</P>

man when he is &s;hewing another an error, that he would point out &s;ome way for relief; but Mr. Paine, who boa&s;ts of being an in&s;trument in liberating us from monarchial oppre&s;&s;ion, has created and now damns; for in no part of his Age of Rea&s;on has he pointed out any method in which we may wor&s;hip. Mr. Paine denies the bible and the Koran, or what is called the Alkoran, as equally fal&s;e; we mu&s;t of con&s;equence lay a&s;ide both and adhere to the dictates of rea&s;on; and in this point every man has a right to make a propo&s;al, what kind of way, attitude or method is to be taken; for as I before mentioned, all nations wor&s;hip God, and in our lo&s;t &s;ituation, they are far &s;uperior to us, each having their e&s;tab|li&s;hed modes and the tradition of their, forefathers, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aught them to wor&s;hip the Good Spirit. That there is a good and bad &s;pirit, or in our primative language, God and the Devil, all hi&s;torians agree,&mdash;and the intention or act of doing an unju&s;t thing or committing tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an affront to their Good Spirit. Ever &s;ince I have read Paine's Age of Rea&s;on, I have been thinking that &s;hould this va&s;t continent, which contains near four millions of people and is fa&s;t increa&s;ing, at this day, or at &s;ome fu|ture period, be all of his opinion, what a medly and jargon it would make! For if the bible is laid a&s;ide as a piece of impo&s;ition or fal&s;e hi&s;tory, there is no command to &s;erve God any way: Therefore, in the fir&s;t place, there would be no a&s;&s;embling together to wor&s;hip on the &s;eventh, or any other day, and of con&s;equence all churches would be converted to o|ther purpo&s;es. Some would be for adopting &s;ome kind of wor&s;hip, and others would be for no &s;y&s;tem. However, I am of opinion a very large majority would be for having &s;ome regular mode of wor&s;hip held up; and as every man would be at his option
<PB N="247" REF="027681_0242_0FD5DC21A569F120">
what mode to adopt, it would be, properly &s;peaking, a medly among&s;t mortals, and make as great con|fu&s;ion a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the building of the tower of Bable; for it mu&s;t be under&s;tood that we have no tradition nor guide but the bible. The&s;e things are too &s;erious to trifle with, and con&s;idering we are happily united under a civil and religious government of our own voluntary wills, I would propo&s;e continuing as we are, and judge it more &s;afe than to &s;ubmit to chance. Nay if there is no truth in the bible, we are &s;afe; for God will never damn a man for his ignorance. I am fond of Mr. Paine's title page, and it is an un|&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ing that we live in an age of rea&s;on, in which &s;ome doctrines that u&s;ed to be &s;trenuou&s;ly preached are much di&s;countenanced: I mean the doctrines held by &s;ome Prede&s;tinarians which I nev|er did nor never intended to believe. I recollect, when a boy, my mother ordered me to read a book that treated on prede&s;tination. I came to a pa&s;&s;age in which the author &s;aid he made no doubt but there were children in hell not more than a &s;pan, or nine inches long; he did not &s;ay inches, but the word <HI>&s;pan</HI> I &s;hall ever remember. I was &s;truck with a|mazement, and have ever &s;ince di&s;pi&s;ed &s;uch ideas. I am often &s;truck with the reflection when my chil|dren are dandling and playing with all the innocence that a feeling heart can conceive, that (according to the principles of Prede&s;tinarians) two thirds of the dear pledges are called into exi&s;tence to be made mi&s;erable through an endle&s;s eternity; as I cannot retain any idea of my childrens having a better chance than others, nor of their being by nature, better than tho&s;e born among Pagans or elsewhere. The doctrines of Prede&s;tination appears &s;o derogato|ry to a Supreme Being, who created worlds un|known, the whole &s;y&s;tem of which appears in &s;uch
<PB N="248" REF="027681_0243_0FD5DC25047259F8">
harmonious order, and every thing &s;o well orna|mented in this creation for the reception of every one born into it, that it damps the ideas of his ju&s;tice and philanthropy, and I believe has been the cau&s;e of many delu&s;ions, in&s;anities and &s;elf-murders; for in&s;tance, when a per&s;on begins to be thoughtful a|bout a future &s;tate, he immediately begins to think him&s;elf a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el, which indicates that the Al|mighty has re&s;pect to per&s;ons. Others &s;uppo&s;e them|&s;elves de&s;tined for eternal wrath, and di&s;pairing of God's mercy frequently put an end to their lives. On the whole I mu&s;t pronounce the per&s;on who holds to the doctrine, that God created from all eter|nity &s;ome to happine&s;s and &s;ome to mi&s;ery, an inhu|man being. Nay I &s;hudder while I am writing on this &s;ubject. But I will quit &s;o di&s;agreeable a theme with ob&s;erving that it cannot be po&s;&s;ible the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;uch &s;entiments have ever taken a view of the greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s of that being who is in|finite in ju&s;tice and mercy.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine's refutation of the bible appears to me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">orthodox, particularly in America, as we wi&s;h to give tho&s;e volumes we call &s;acred, their due weight, not having Popes, Inqui&s;itions, Friars, Bi&s;hops and &s;uch pe&s;ts of mortals, who traffic with the go&s;|pel for the lucre of gain and oppre&s;s the people to make them&s;elves rich, merely through the terrors of fal&s;e repre&s;entation. But on the contrary, in Ame|rica, &s;cientific knowledge pretty generally prevails, and we can have no better example than the travels of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. They be&s;peak every thing which is nece&s;&s;ary to mortals; the whole tenor is humility towards God, and to love one another, &s;eed the hungry, clothe the naked, vi&s;it the &s;ick and impri&s;oned, and the great duty of doing as we would be done by. The whole appears to be a pattern of
<PB N="249" REF="027681_0244_0FD5DC27D797B7F8">
friend&s;hip, equal to the dignity of &s;o great a per&s;on|age. The &s;ermon on the mount, is a pledge of purity; and the whole of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is a pattern of morality which cannot be copied by a mere man, as there appears in his travels one uniform &s;y&s;tem of piety; and it is very extraordinary to me, that &s;o much bigotry has ever gained ground in the differ|ent modes of wor&s;hip; every one thinks his own the mo&s;t &s;afe. Our Saviour's prediction of the de&s;truc|tion of Jeru&s;alem, that there &s;hould not of the tem|ple be left one &s;tone upon another is, according to Thomp&s;on's travels, and other hi&s;torians, exactly fulfilled; and the prophecy of the de&s;truction of Babylon, &s;o prophetically foretold by Jeremiah, that "Babylon the great, the mighty, is fallen, and &s;hall become a den for owls and pelicans, although it was once the greate&s;t and riche&s;t city in the world." Its walls was &s;aid by &s;ome to be &s;even, and by &s;ome fourteen miles in circumference, fifty feet in height, and &s;o wide that two chariots could drive abrea&s;t; having gardens erected in the air for ornament, and to di&s;play its grandeur: yet no account is given where it &s;tood, although &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e that Grand Cairo &s;tands on or near its ruins, within two miles of the river Nile, in Egypt, and is &s;aid to contain two millions and an half of people. However, for my part, the bu&s;tle and bu&s;ine&s;s that I am obliged to attend to, in order to obtain the nece&s;&s;aries in life for my&s;elf and family, will not permit my particular attention; but whoever denies the prophecies, let them read Newton on the &s;ubject, and they will be convinced, in my opinion, of their being wrote from in&s;piration.</P>
<P>As I have before ob&s;erved, I never intended to be &s;o much of a writer as to appear in public; but &s;ince I have &s;o far proceeded, I de&s;ire that nothing I
<PB N="250" REF="027681_0245_0FD5DC2951BEA9E0">
have advanced may be taken ami&s;s; for I wi&s;h to be hone&s;t, and fairly give my &s;entiments. When I be|gun I did not expect to be &s;o lengthy; but I de&s;pi&s;e apologizing, and will conclude with a recommenda|tion to all per&s;ons, but particularly youth, not to be led away by this or that writer or ob&s;erver; but act virtuou&s;ly on this &s;hort &s;tage of life; for &s;oon very &s;oon we mu&s;t go the way of all the earth, to give place to millions yet to be called into exi&s;tence. Therefore, as Doctor Young &s;ays, "Lean not on earth, 'twil pierce thee too the heart&mdash;a broken reed at be&s;t, but of't a &s;pear. On its &s;harp point peace bleeds, and hope expires."
