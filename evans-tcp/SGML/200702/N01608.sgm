<P>It is very plain, That the <HI>Puni&s;h|ment</HI> which the GOD of Truth has Threatened for <HI>Sin,</HI> is not inflicted in the <HI>Pre&s;ent State.</HI> The <HI>Threa|tenings</HI> of GOD which are all <HI>True and Faithfull,</HI> and &s;hall <HI>&s;urely come to pa&s;s,</HI> are not fulfilled in the <HI>Pre|&s;ent State.</HI> The <HI>Sentence against e|vil Works</HI> is not &s;o <HI>&s;peedily Executed,</HI> but that the <HI>Ungodly</HI> often <HI>Pro&s;per in the World,</HI> neither are <HI>they plagued like others,</HI> nor are there any <HI>Bonds in their Death:</HI> At the &s;ame time, The Children of GOD, may &s;ay, <HI>All the Day long have I been plagued.</HI> But, O you that have your <HI>Hearts fully &s;et in you to do Evil,</HI> From this very Thing you may Conclude, That there is a FUTURE STATE, wherein the <HI>Puni&s;hment of Sin,</HI> will be &s;uch that it &s;hall be according to that word; <HI>Mine Eye &s;hall not &s;pare,

Now, I call to mind a &s;aying, Luk.

<P>The <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of our Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS from the Dead, has had &s;uch <HI>Infallible Proofs,</HI> that nothing but &s;ome <HI>Satanick Energy</HI> can make any <HI>Man</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Bruit,</HI> as to admit a|ny Doubt upon it.

<HI>Body</HI> can do!) that it <HI>Survives</HI> after the <HI>Death</HI> of the <HI>Body.</HI> Being <HI>Spi|rit and not Fle&s;h, therefore they &s;hall not fail together.</HI> But above all, there is this to put the point beyond all <HI>Probability.</HI> The Glorious LORD, who is the Creator and Redeemer of our Soul, has po&s;itively told us, <HI>They which kill the Body are not able to kill the Soul.</HI> No profane &s;huf|flings can Evade the force of this Proof! <HI>Man,</HI> Thy <HI>Soul,</HI> is a <HI>Candle of the Lord.</HI> Thy SAVIOUR who has placed this <HI>Lamp</HI> in the <HI>Earthen Ve&s;&s;el,</HI> has affirmed unto thee, that it is not Extingui&s;hed by the Break|ing of the <HI>Earthen Ve&s;&s;el.</HI> No, He will keep it in its Exi&s;tance to Eter|nal Ages. The <HI>Spring</HI> in my Watch, will not be &s;tript of its <HI>Elasticity,</HI> and cea&s;e to be a <HI>Spring,</HI> when it &s;hall be taken out of the <HI>Machine</HI> whereof it now cau&s;es the various <HI>Motions.</HI> Nor the <HI>Soul</HI> when ta|ken out of the <HI>Body.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Our SAVIOUR has a&s;|&s;ured us of this; <HI>That the Body which
<PB N="18" REF="001910_0020_0FB9D2D9E85DD4F0">
is by Death parted from the Soul, &s;hall by a Re&s;urrection from the Dead, be Restored unto it.</HI> It is not a <HI>Final</HI> and <HI>Endle&s;s</HI> parting of them, when the <HI>Dust returns to the Earth as it was,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit returns to GOD that gave it.</HI> No; The <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Soul,</HI> may &s;ay to one another at parting; <HI>We &s;hall come together again.</HI> The Glorious LORD, who <HI>Rais'd His own Body from the Dead,</HI> has left us no Room to doubt of His <HI>Rai&s;ing Ours,</HI> when He has peremp|torily told us; Joh. V. 28, 29. <HI>The Hour is Coming, in the which, all that are in the Graves &s;hall hear His Voice; And they &s;hall come forth; They that have done good unto the Re&s;urrection of Life; and they that have done evil, unto the Re&s;urrection of Damnation.</HI> It is mo&s;t certainly &s;o! GOD In|carnate and Enthroned in our SA|VIOUR will one Day Return from Heaven, and in that notable Day, <HI>according to the working of His Migh|ty Power, whereby He is able to &s;ub|due all things unto Him&s;elf,</HI> He will
<PB N="19" REF="001910_0021_0FB9D2DD586EA768">
fetch the <HI>Seeds</HI> of our di&s;&s;olved <HI>Bo|dies</HI> from the Chambers of <HI>Death;</HI> He will <HI>Fill the Dead Bodies;</HI> He will return them to our <HI>Souls;</HI> to be Re-animated, with marvellous alterations upon them.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Our SAVIOUR hath a&s;&s;ured us of this; <HI>That after a Re|&s;urrection from the Dead, the Wicked &s;hall in Body as well as in Soul, be Puni&s;hed with very De&s;tructive Mi&s;e|ries.</HI> Be &s;ure, The <HI>Soul</HI> of a Wicked Man cannot but be very mi&s;erable, from the Time of its going from the <HI>Body.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Soul</HI> &s;tript of all the <HI>Enjoyments,</HI> which it chu&s;es in&s;tead of the Glorious GOD, from whom it has wretchedly wandred; It is a <HI>Soul</HI> full of <HI>Remor&s;e</HI> for its pa&s;t Follies, and full of <HI>Horror</HI> in the pro&s;pect of a <HI>Wrath to come;</HI> It is a <HI>Soul,</HI> Abhorred by GOD, and Ba|ni&s;hed from GOD, and A&s;&s;ociated with <HI>Devils,</HI> which are <HI>Tormentors</HI> unto it. And, Oh! the <HI>Torments</HI> of it! Now, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the <HI>Soul</HI> of a Wicked
<PB N="20" REF="001910_0022_0FB9D2E3F74809E0">
Man, will have its Condition mend|ed by a <HI>Return</HI> to the <HI>Body.</HI> No; The Re&s;urrection of the <HI>D</HI>ead will be, upon that Intention; [For &s;o it is to be read;] 2 Cor. V. 10 <HI>We must all appear before the Judg|ment-Seat of CHRIST, that every one may receive in the Body, according to what he hath done, whether Good or Bad.</HI> But, Oh! what will the <HI>Soul</HI> &s;uffer in the <HI>Body,</HI> and what will the Rai&s;ed <HI>Body</HI> &s;uffer with and from the <HI>Soul,</HI> when GOD &s;hall again unite them, on purpo&s;e to lay upon them the <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> which belongs unto them! Syrs, Will you hearken to the <HI>Faithful &s;ayings of GOD!</HI> The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of our SAVI|OUR, has given us all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;urance, <HI>That GOD has appointed a Day wherein He will Judge the World by Him;</HI> and <HI>That we &s;hall all &s;tand before the Judgment-Seat of CHRIST;</HI> and, <HI>That every one of us &s;hall give an Account of him&s;elf unto GOD.</HI> The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of our SAVIOUR, has given us an undoubted A&s;&s;urance, <HI>That

He will come to render unto all Men according to their works;</HI> and, <HI>That then the Wicked &s;hall go away into an Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI> The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of our SAVIOUR has given us a Repeted A&s;&s;urance, That <HI>the Wicked &s;hall be Puni&s;hed with an Everlasting Destruction from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the Glory of His Power;</HI> and, <HI>That the Angels &s;hall come forth and cast them into a Fur|nace of Fire; where &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;hing of Teeth.</HI> After this <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> there is no room for any <HI>Di&s;qui&s;ition.</HI> The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> &s;peaks the&s;e things; There is no want of any further <HI>Demonstration.</HI></P>
<P>III. Twice has the <HI>Trumpet</HI> &s;ound|ed; The &s;ound mu&s;t wax <HI>Louder and Louder.

<P>Unto this tremendous A&s;&s;ertion, there has been a mighty <HI>Army of Martyrs</HI> who have born a <HI>Testimony,</HI> which ought to be far from Con|temptible with us. Come with me, to <HI>Mahanaim,</HI> and &s;ee the <HI>Hosts of GOD,</HI> and hear their <HI>Testimony.</HI> There have been Thou&s;ands of good and wi&s;e Men, who rather than Sin again&s;t the Glorious GOD have <HI>not loved their Lives unto the Death;</HI> but been willing to Dye be|fore the Term to which in the cour&s;e of Nature they might have <HI>lived.</HI> When the&s;e Men were put

<P>What will be the more <HI>&s;pecial kinds</HI> of the <HI>Destructive mi&s;eries</HI> in the <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> of the Damned in HELL; This is a Thing very much con|cealed from us, as well as the more particular place of Torment.

<P>The Name which our SAVI|OUR u&s;es for the HELL wherein <HI>GOD will de&s;troy both Soul and Body</HI> of the Wicked, even, GEHENNA; This carries in it, what is very <HI>For|midable.</HI> 'Tis as much as to &s;ay, <HI>The Valley of Hinnom.</HI> Tragical Things were done in <HI>the Valley of Hinnom,</HI> when the Diabolical Idola|ters offered up their Children to <HI>Molock</HI> there; and employed the Noi&s;e of Drums to drown the dole|ful Cry of the Infants while they were <HI>Burning Alive</HI> unto the Devil.

<P>But, you look for <HI>Demon&s;trations.</HI> I affirm to you, No <HI>Death</HI> &s;o For|midable, as the <HI>Destructive Mi&s;eries</HI> of that HELL, wherein the <HI>wicked</HI>
