<P>THO' we, of the pre&s;ent Generation, are fallen into the very Dregs of Time, wherein, if the Stewards in God's Hou&s;e are faithful to their divine Ma&s;ter, they mu&s;t lift up their Voices as Trumpets, to te&s;|tify again&s;t the God-provoking Impieties of a pro|fe&s;&s;ing People, and warn a &s;inful Generation to flee from the Wrath to come: However all their &s;olemn Declarations may be reproached with the fa&s;hionable Epithet of Cant and Whine, and their mo&s;t plain and &s;criptural Repre&s;entations of the dreadful Con&s;equences of Rebellion again&s;t Heaven, be e&s;teemed har&s;h, ungenteel and unmannerly, by the Gay and polite Sinners of the Age; Yet if Men wou'd but &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider this Matter, without any Re&s;entment of the Preacher's hone&s;t Plainne&s;s, only as it is repre&s;ented in the &s;acred Cannon, it will appear that the dreadful Confu&s;ion, the amazing Horror and eternal Torments, which will be the inevitable Con&s;equence of a Life of Impiety, inconceiv|ably exceeds the utmo&s;t Reach of their mo&s;t extended Imagi|nation; enough to make the &s;toute&s;t hearted Rebel, again&s;t the mo&s;t high God, fall down and cry out, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved,</HI> from the impending Wrath of a ju&s;t God, that is ready to be poured out on my guilty naked Soul, in one eternal Storm! yea, to lay his Hand upon his Mouth, and his Face in the Du&s;t, if &s;o be, there may be Hope.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould we, for once, put even Eternity out of the Account, and only view the various Mi&s;chiefs done to human
<PB N="4" REF="008356_0004_102F3C2A5CB63070">
Society, by the daring Crimes of bold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, as well as the Mi&s;eries &s;uch bring upon them&s;elves, even in this World; one would think that a due Con&s;ideration, even of this, might be a &s;ufficient Re&s;traint from gro&s;s Iniquities, to every one that has the lea&s;t Degree of Benevolence, or Spark of Self-Love dwelling in his Heart. Yet, alas! &s;uch is that Tyranny which the unbridled Lu&s;ts of abandon'd Sinners, exerci&s;e over their rational Powers, that they thoughtle&s;sly, hurry on in the full Career of &s;en&s;ual Gratifications; not con|&s;idering that De&s;truction and Mi&s;ery is in their Way, nor once regarding the Mi&s;chief they are doing to the whole Com|munity, whereof they are Members; whil&s;t by their Contempt of all Laws, both Divine and Human, they are really the Troublers of God's People, bringing crim&s;on Guilt on the Land, and pulling down complicated Judgments upon the Inhabitants thereof; and when God's People are not vigilent|ly careful to bring &s;uch to &s;uitable Puni&s;hment, their criminal Connivance, or indolent Negligence, inhances common Guilt, and brings down aggravated Wrath: Whereas, on the Con|trary, when the Powers, which are ordained of God, exert them&s;elves to their utmo&s;t to detect and puni&s;h Evil-doers, they hereby become Mini&s;ters of God for Good to his People, remove Guilt, and prevent Judgments. Thus it was in the Ca&s;e of Achan, who&s;e Crime, Trial, Confe&s;&s;ion and Execu|tion, we have the Record of in this Chapter.</P>
<P>As I have already, both for the Benefit of the condemned Criminal, now before me, and al&s;o of the Public, from Jo&s;hua's Advice to Achan, Ver. 19, took Occa&s;ion to point out, and enforce this Criminal's Duty, to make a full, free and unre&s;er|ved public Confe&s;&s;ion of his Crimes, by which he has forfeited his Life, and a faithful Di&s;covery of all his A&s;&s;ociates in Ini|quity: So as we are now a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee the Execution of a ju&s;t Sentence pronounced upon him, and witne&s;s his &s;uffering the Penalty of the Law, which he has broken, and behold him violently cut off from the Land of the Living; as being &s;o mi&s;chevious to Community, that he de&s;erves not to be con|tinued a Member of human Society: Allow me to &s;ugge&s;t to you a few Things on this melancholly Occa&s;ion, from the Words of Jo&s;hua to Achan, ju&s;t before his Execution. You doubtle&s;s remember Theft was the Crime for which Achan was both indicted and executed. The &s;ad Affair &s;tood thus:
<PB N="5" REF="008356_0005_102F3C2F2A4EB040">
Upon the miraculous Reduction of Jericho, Achan, contrary to an Expre&s;s divine Prohibition, Chap. vi. Ver. 18, feloni|ou&s;ly takes away &s;undry Goods, with a Wedge of Gold, which he hid under the Earth in his Tent: Soon after Jo&s;hua &s;ends three Thou&s;and Men on an Expedition again&s;t Ai, but on their fir&s;t Attack they fled before the Men of that Place, and returned with the Lo&s;s of Thirty-&s;ix Men. Jo&s;hua, &s;en&s;ible of the Cau&s;e by the Effect, that a jealous God was &s;ome way provoked, rent his Cloaths, fell upon his Face to the Earth, with the Elders of I&s;rael, in which Po&s;ture he and they con|tinued till Even-Tide; when Jo&s;hua prays to God to di&s;cover the Rea&s;on of &s;o &s;hameful a Defeat. God an&s;wers his Pray|ers, &s;hews him the Rea&s;on, gives Direction to find out the Felon, and orders what Death he &s;hall die. Thereupon Jo|&s;hua ari&s;es early in the Morning, and by attending the divine Direction given him, Achan is taken, whom Jo&s;hua exhorts to make a public and full Confe&s;&s;ion of his Crime; with this he readily complies; and his Confe&s;&s;ion appears true, by the &s;tolen Goods being found in the Spot where he &s;aid he had hid them; then the Children of I&s;rael take and bring him to the Place of Execution, where Jo&s;hua previou&s;ly addre&s;&s;es him in the Words of my Text, both by Way of Query and awful Threatning, <HI>Why ha&s;t thou troubled us? the Lord &s;hall trouble thee this Day;</HI> q. d. Can you po&s;&s;ibly offer any Rea&s;on to ju&s;tify your Conduct, in abu&s;ing and thus troubling the whole Camp of I&s;rael, by provoking God to anger with them? Know a&s;&s;uredly, it will be repaid this Day; we are ordered to take thee from the Land of the Living, and &s;end thee to God's dread Tribunal, to an&s;wer for all thy Crimes, nor can one Day's Reprieve be allowed thee from the Execution of that Sentence of Death thou art now under.</P>
<P>WHAT I de&s;ign, further from the Words, is to &s;hew:</P>
<P>I. How it is, that notorious Sinners trouble God's People.</P>
<P>II. WHAT Troubles &s;uch undergo, when God brings them to condign Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>III. MAKE &s;ome &s;uitable Improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> I am to &s;hew, how it is that notorious Sinners Trouble God's People. And in general: They trouble them in their whole common Cour&s;e of Life. All their Schemes are con|certed and pro&s;ecuted, &s;ome Way or other, to the Damage
<PB N="6" REF="008356_0006_102F3C32E3069D20">
and Injury of the Publick. They &s;et up their own private and per&s;onal Intere&s;t, above that of the Community; nay, fre|quently in Oppo&s;ition to it, and pur&s;ue it in &s;uch a Way, as that if they &s;ucceed, the publick Intere&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ink. It is one of the fir&s;t Maxims with this Sort of Vermin, that it is no Matter what Injury is done to any particular Per&s;on, or what Damage accrues to Communities, if it is but &s;ub&s;ervient to their own private Advantage, nor do they regard how &s;hameful, &s;ordid and vile the Methods are, in which they pur&s;ue it, if they are but &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>BUT particularly, &s;uch trouble God's People, by ruining the Intere&s;t of the Publick. Every Body Politic, whether Kingdom, Province, Colony or Corporation, has an Intere&s;t of its own, in which all its Members are included, and hence it becomes both the Duty and Intere&s;t of every Member, in their Conduct, to pur&s;ue the Good of the Whole; and where the&s;e come in Competition, to prefer the public Weal to their own private Intere&s;t; nor can they hone&s;tly pro&s;ecute their own Profit, but in this beautiful and becoming Subordination. Such therefore, as &s;et up their own per&s;onal Advantage, as the chief Prize they keep in their Eye, regard not what be|comes of Public, even though their own private Advantage &s;hould finally terminate in its utter De&s;truction. Their own Gain is the Deity they wor&s;hip, let the Con&s;equences be what they will unto others. Thus Achan, to gratify his own cove|tous Thir&s;t after Gain, fell a pilfering among the Stuff, not regarding in the lea&s;t, what malign Influence his Theft might have on the whole Congregation of I&s;rael. <HI>Auri Sacra Fames, quid non Mortali Pectora coges!</HI></P>
<P>THIS Principle acts variou&s;ly in different Per&s;ons; yet the Con&s;equences are, in a greater or le&s;s Degree, the &s;ame in all, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> de&s;tructive to the Intere&s;ts of Society; for it is only the &s;ame Principle acting in various Forms, or the Improvement of different Methods, for the Attainments of the &s;elf &s;ame End, to-wit, the building up per&s;onal, on the Ruin of public Intere&s;t. Some it inclines to the Practice of picking, pilfer|ing and &s;tealing from their Neighbours; while others chu&s;e to act more covertly, under &s;ome Shew of Hone&s;ty, yet car|rying on a Trade of over-reaching, cozening, cheating, ex|tortion and defrauding in their Dealings. Some not &s;o well &s;uited with the former ba&s;e Methods of hurting the Public,
<PB N="7" REF="008356_0007_102F3C3480E585D0">
by ruining its Members, as it were, &s;ingly, one after another; take a more expeditious Method, as they conceive, to become rich, by ruining whole Provinces and Colonies; aiming, by one fatal Stab, to let out the very Heart's Blood of Commu|nities. The&s;e Mi&s;creants are very &s;en&s;ible that no civil State can &s;ub&s;i&s;t or flouri&s;h without Trade and Commerce, and that this can never be maintained without &s;ome fix'd and pro|per Medium; being too lazy by lawful Indu&s;try, to procure a Sufficiency of &s;uch Medium, to provide Things hone&s;t in the Sight of all Men, and a&s;hamed to beg, they lay them|&s;elves out in the mo&s;t &s;hameful Practice of counterfeiting the public Currency, of their own and neighbouring Govern|ments. Of this Kind are our Money-Makers, a Brood of Vipers, that are eating out the Bowels of Provinces and Co|lonies, and by their Practice rendering them&s;elves a common Neu&s;ance, to be dete&s;ted and purged out by every one, who has any Reli&s;h for the Comforts of a &s;ocial Life: The&s;e care not how much they di&s;tre&s;s the State, by ruining its Trade, and cheating it out of its proper Medium, whil&s;t they endea|vour to impo&s;e upon it, their own &s;purious Stuff, as if it were current Money with the Merchants; who &s;ees not when this Cheat is artfully managed, and &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on, that it increa&s;es the Medium, in Proportion to the Number of Counterfeits; and that this, with other Things, has had a direct Tendency to depreciate the public Bills of &s;ome Colo|nies to &s;o great a Degree, as rendered them almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s: Be&s;ides &s;uch Bills mu&s;t finally peri&s;h in the Hands of &s;ome or other, who mu&s;t inevitably &s;u&s;tain the Lo&s;s of it, and the Lo&s;s of every Member is the Lo&s;s of the Whole. Others in|fe&s;t the Traveller on the public Road, rob him of his Property, and &s;ometimes of his Life. Others leave the Land, and com|mence Pirates by Sea, to the great Detriment of foreign Trade, and Ruin of particular Undertakers. Thus, in their &s;everal Turns, and various Methods of Iniquity, &s;uch Ene|mies of Mankind, as far as lies in their Power, ruin the pub|lic Intere&s;t, and thereby render them&s;elves Troublers of God's People.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> By bringing Di&s;tre&s;s on the Public; and this they do in &s;undry Re&s;pects; as,</P>
<P>BY bringing divine Judgments on God's People. God declares, that becau&s;e of &s;wearing, the Land mourns. In Ho&s;.
<PB N="8" REF="008356_0008_102F3C3729DDCDD0">
iv. 1, 2, 3, God declares, <HI>He had a Controver&s;y with the Land, becau&s;e there was no Truth, nor Mercy, nor Knowledge of God in the Land. By &s;wearing, and lying, and killing, and &s;tealing, and committing Adultery, they breake out, and Blood toucheth Blood; therefore &s;hall the Land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein, &s;hall langui&s;h,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT why need I multiply Quotations of this Kind from the Scriptures, the In&s;tance in our Text may be &s;ufficient. Here in our Context, we have the Army of I&s;rael fleeing be|fore the Men of Ai, on the Account of Achan's Villany, as the God of Armies him&s;elf te&s;tifies, Ver. 11, 12, of our Con|text; <HI>I&s;rael hath &s;inned, and they have al&s;o tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed my Cove|nant, which I commanded them; for they have even taken of the accur&s;ed Thing, and have al&s;o &s;tolen and di&s;&s;embled, and they have put it among their Stuff. Therefore the Children of I&s;rael could not &s;tand before their Enemies, becau&s;e they were accur&s;ed, neither will I be with you any more, except ye de&s;troy the accur&s;ed from among you.</HI> God, the Judge of all the Earth, expre&s;sly charges the whole Camp with Guilt, and pronounces it ac|cur&s;ed for the Sin of one Man: Well might Solomon &s;ay, <HI>One Sinner de&s;troyeth much Good,</HI> when the Sin of one Man be|comes &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to all I&s;rael.</P>
<P>A LIKE Ca&s;e we have, Numb. xxv. Chapter, where the Plague was &s;ent into the Camp, for the Sin of Zimri and Cozbi, and by their Death it was &s;tay'd. Again,</P>
<P>THEY often troubled God's People to find them out, and bring them to de&s;erved Puni&s;hment. The Body of a People may feel the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Effects of Wickedne&s;s committed among&s;t them, and yet for &s;ome Time not be able to di&s;co|ver the Actors; they feel them&s;elves &s;mitten, and greviou&s;ly wounded in their Intere&s;ts, but cannot di&s;cern the Hand that &s;trikes them; and &s;o, &s;ometimes in order to prevent their own Ruin, they are obliged to take a great deal of Pains, u&s;e various Methods, and be at much Co&s;t, to find out tho&s;e Troublers of their Peace, and De&s;troyers of their Pro&s;perity. How much Pains did Jo&s;hua take, to explore the true Cau&s;e of the Mi&s;chief that befel the Army? None knew the Cau&s;e of the &s;ad Defeat, therefore the whole Congregation of all the Tribes of I&s;rael mu&s;t be a&s;&s;embled, a Lot mu&s;t he ca&s;t for every Tribe, then thro' every Family of the taken Tribe, and la&s;tly thro' every Per&s;on of the di&s;covered Family, Man

by Man, till at la&s;t Achan is taken. Such Evil-doers exert all their devili&s;h Craft and Cunning, to &s;ecret them&s;elves and Crimes, that they may keep out of the Hand of Ju&s;tice, and multiply Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion with Impunity, and &s;o often cre|ate much Trouble and Expence to the Publick, as well as to the Per&s;ons particularly injured by them, to find them out, and cut them off.</P>
<P>THEY occa&s;ion al&s;o great Trouble and Di&s;tre&s;s to the Minds of God's People: Tho' Sinners make light of the blacke&s;t Crimes, yet they appear awfully aggravated to &s;uch as love and fear God. It is a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Thing to every &s;uch Soul, to think that God is publickly di&s;honoured by the bold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of his Law among&s;t them, and that heavy Guilt lies upon the Land of their Habitation; hence <HI>their Hearts tremble for Fear of God, and they are afraid of his Judg|ments.</HI> The Man after God's own Heart, to &s;ee others vio|late the Precepts, and trample on the Authority of the great God, was mo&s;t deeply affected, when he cries out, P&s;alm cxix. cxxxvi, <HI>Rivers of Water run down mine Eyes, becau&s;e they kept not thy Law.</HI> So P&s;alm cxxxix. 21, <HI>Am I not griev|ed with tho&s;e that ri&s;e up again&s;t thee?</HI> Grieved for the Con|tempt ca&s;t on thine Authority, and the eternal De&s;truction brought upon them&s;elves by their Rebellions again&s;t thee.

<P>HERE I mu&s;t own my&s;elf non-plu&s;&s;ed, to paint to you, my Hearers, the Shocks, the Racks, the Horrors of a condem|ned Malefactor (if he has any Sen&s;e at all of his Guilt) ju&s;t ready to feel the full Weight of his de&s;erved Puni&s;hment, from the Hand of that God <HI>who will render to every one according to their Works.</HI> When he comes to the Day of his Execution, &s;ees the In&s;truments of Death prepared, to &s;end him to an unknown World of Spirits, and waft him to the dreadful flaming Tribunal of the great JEHOVAH: My very Soul is ready to &s;ink under the Burthen of the Thoughts, to con&s;ider how deep Remor&s;e for all his former Crimes, &s;ettles on his awakened Con&s;cience, and the never dying Worm begins to prey upon his very Heart-Strings. O what Horror mu&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="008356_0010_102F3C3D2005B548">
he feel, if in an impenitent State, at the Approach of Death! What di&s;mal Clouds mu&s;t hang over his Mind! What Per|plexity and Angui&s;h fill his &s;huddering Soul! when the fatal Period comes, and not one Hour nor Moment's Reprieve can be granted, but die he mu&s;t! Die as a Malefactor, unpi|tied by Heaven and Earth, if impenitent. Yet all this is nothing to the Pre-apprehen&s;ions of an eternal Exi&s;tence, if unpardoned, where nothing but Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Angui&s;h, awaits them in a Dungeon, infinitely darker than that from whence he was bro't forth to Execu|tion; even Blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s for ever. Could we hear the Soliloquy of a condemned Malefactor, might we not rea|&s;onably expect it would be groaned out in &s;uch mournful Language as this, accented with the mo&s;t Heart-rending Sighs! <Q>Alas! my trembling Soul, what a Shudder &s;eized thee when the awful Sentence of Death, the accur&s;ed Death to hang on a Tree, made both my Ears to tingle! Now I know the certain determined Hour of my Death, and every Moment ha&s;tens it on: O! the awful Hour, when I mu&s;t be hung up, a Spectacle to Angels and Men, between Heaven and Earth, becau&s;e unworthy of both. How &s;candalou&s;ly &s;hameful the Death! and yet how ju&s;t, when I reflect on a Life &s;pent in &s;uch open Ho&s;tility again&s;t the God that made me, and the Villanies I have perpetrated, &s;o injuri|rious to the public Weal of my fellow Men; by which I have forfeited my Life into the Hand of civil Ju&s;tice, and now mu&s;t die unpitied, unlamented! But O! my Soul, all this would be nothing, yea le&s;s than nothing, did not Death plunge thee into a new World, &s;et thee in a new State, where thou mu&s;t meet with a new, and perhaps dreadful Reward for thy Crimes. And now behold the awful Day is come, look my Soul, my Coffin &s;tands before me, view the Crouds a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee the ju&s;t Sentence ex|ecuted upon me, and now but one Hour or two to make my Peace with Heaven, and do the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my whole Life in, which has hitherto been neglected, and in a few Minutes more O! my guilty trembling Soul, thou art to make thine Appearance before the Judgment-Seat of the dread Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth, and all thy Crimes will meet thee before that Bar, and thou mu&s;t give an Ac|count
<PB N="11" REF="008356_0011_102F3C40CD313280">
of all the Deeds done in the Body, and receive ac|cording to that which thou ha&s;t done; and therefore ha&s;t Rea&s;on to fear a Sentence infinitely more tremendous than that which condemned me to Death here, even, <HI>Depart thou cur&s;ed into Everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WHEN a condemned Malefactor, on the very Verge of Eternity, thus views him&s;elf, and &s;peaks to his own Soul, who can &s;tretch a Thought comprehen&s;ive of his Trouble and Di&s;|tre&s;s!

May he long enjoy the Honour, and feel the Plea&s;ure of doing good, and never put up the Sword of civil Ju&s;tice until he has hew'd to Pieces that whole Knot of Re|bels; brought their black and horrid Schemes to light, and the Authors and Abetters to the de&s;erved Reward of their Villanies. The Honourable Judges of our Supreme Court of Judicature, in this Province, as well as the Wor&s;hipful Judges of the Se&s;&s;ions, in this County, together with the other Officers of our Court; have very di&s;tingui&s;hingly ex|erted them&s;elves, to break up that helli&s;h Club, and prevent further Mi&s;chief to the Public, from that Quarter; and merit our &s;incere&s;t Thanks for their &s;ingular Service herein, done to the Public, and wherein every Man of us may feel our Share. Here I would ju&s;t beg Leave to wi&s;h them Succe&s;s in this Affair, for the future, not doubting from their pa&s;t Conduct, but that they will &s;till exert them&s;elves &s;o as to prove a Terror to &s;uch evil Doers, and root &s;uch a Sink of Villians out of the Province; which will be an un&s;peakable Service done to the Public, tran&s;mit their Names with Ho|nour to Po&s;terity, and gain them highe&s;t E&s;teem from all hone&s;t Men, who have a true Regard to the public Intere&s;t, and rejoice in its flouri&s;hing Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d</HI> INFER. When wicked Men by their Crimes, become in&s;upportable to the State, it is a Piece of public Service done to Mankind, for the civil Authority, to cut them off; hereby they become Mini&s;ters of God for the People's Good, nor can they become otherwi&s;e a Terror to Evil-Doers; to acquit the Guilty is as much an Abomination in the Sight of God, as to condemn the Innocent. The cutting of a Wart or a Wen from the Body, does not only free it from that trouble&s;ome and deforming Excre&s;cence, which to the Lo&s;s of the whole, drew off &s;o much Nutrition to maintain its u&s;ele&s;s and trouble&s;ome Bulk; but it may prevent the Growth of many more, that would in Proportion, rob the Body of proper Nouri&s;hment. The public Puni&s;hment of a Malefactor, is not meerly to re&s;train him, but that it may

terrify other Workers of Iniquity, <HI>that they may hear and fear, and do no more &s;o wickedly.</HI> All &s;uitable Care and Pains &s;hould be taken by the civil Magi&s;tracy to reform Offenders, and to &s;pare all that are like to be reformed, and become whole|&s;ome Members of Society; but &s;uch as render them&s;elves un&s;ufferable, mu&s;t be treated as a gangreened Limb, which mu&s;t be amputated, rather than the whole Body peri&s;h. If we have a proper Temper of Mind, we cannot but feel Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion moving in our Hearts, to the very wor&s;t of the human Species, when we &s;ee them &s;uffering for their own criminal Follies: Yet a Regard to di&s;tributive Ju&s;tice and the public Good, &s;hould di&s;po&s;e us to approve the Sentence, and bear a &s;olemn Te&s;timony to its Execution. Achan, by his Wickedne&s;s, had become a &s;inking Burthen, &s;uch as all I&s;rael could not &s;tand under; his Theft was too weighty for the whole Army, and therefore, as &s;oon as his Crime was di&s;co|covered, they readily gave him up to Death, the happy Con&s;equence of which was, that God turned away the Fierc|ne&s;s of his Anger from I&s;rael, and then they could not only &s;tand in Battle, but put their Enemies to Flight. And this, my Hearers, would no doubt be our happy Ca&s;e, were there no Achans to be Trublers of our I&s;rael. Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d</HI> INFER. The great Rea&s;on of the &s;ore and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Judgments we are under, is the open and aggravated Breaches of the divine Laws, that are found in the mid&s;t of us. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that for Years pa&s;t we have been under the Frowns of Heaven, manife&s;ted in a long Series of divine Judgments, one after another, &s;ome in a lighter, and others in a heavier Degree, on this Land.

Where God points out their Sins, and more than once concludes with this awful Inquiry,

<P N="4">4th INFER. How little &s;oever great Sinners think of it, while they are troubling God's People by their horrid Crimes, they are all the while pulling down complicated Sorrows and Troubles on them&s;elves; and they &s;hall, by their own &s;ad Experience feel, that all the&s;e Things &s;hall be Bitterne&s;s in the End. Whil&s;t Sinners are in their full Career of Rebellion again&s;t Heaven, living in Wantonne&s;s and Lux|ury, Idlene&s;s and Theft, Prophanene&s;s and Perjury, rolling Sin as a &s;weet Mor&s;el under their Tongue; they think no|thing of a reckoning Day approaching, or what Sin mu&s;t co&s;t them in the End. But, alas! alas! when divine Ju&s;tice &s;eizes them, and gives them up Pri&s;oners to the Hands of the Civil Magi&s;trate, to cut them off from the Face of the Earth, then Sin appears with another Pro&s;pect; before, they &s;aw nothing but its painted Face, but now they &s;ee and feel its Scorpion's Tail, &s;tinging them to Death! Now all the Honey turns into the Gall of A&s;ps. The Di&s;tre&s;s that will then unavoi|dably &s;eize them, from a View of the Vilene&s;s of their Lives, the &s;candalous Shamefulne&s;s of their Deaths, the Change of their State, and if they are in any &s;uitable Mea&s;ure convinced of the Greatne&s;s and Aggravations of their Guilt, and the

<P N="5">5th INFER. When Sinners, by their heinous and daring Crimes, have for&s;eited their Lives into the Hand of civil Ju&s;|tice, they have none to blame for it, but them&s;elves. They cannot rea&s;onably plead Ignorance of the Law; but know, that he who does &s;uch and &s;uch Things, is worthy of Death; yet they venture on the Crime, and commit the Fact in the Face both of the Law, and of Con&s;cience, knowing that it is for their Lives. Who can they blame? Not the Law; for it is ju&s;t and good: Not their own Ignorance, but their horrid Pre&s;umption; for they know, that the Murderer, the Thief, the Hou&s;e-breaker, the Robber, the Counterfeiter, if convicted, mu&s;t die. Not the Jury that finds them guilty, for they are un|der &s;olemn Oath to do &s;o, upon &s;ufficient Evidence, and may not do otherwi&s;e. Not the Judge who condemns them, for he is obliged in general to give Sentence according to the Jury's Verdict. Not the Governor, becau&s;e he does not reprieve them, for he is under no Obligations to give them back that Life, which they have already forfeited to the Publick; and it might in its Con&s;equences, be very injurious to the Public, to &s;pare that Life, which has already been ju&s;tly forfeited; &s;o that the Blame lies wholly at the Malefactor's own Door, and his Blood will be found upon his own Head. But I &s;hall now conclude with a few brief Addre&s;&s;es on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, I would addre&s;s the Criminal ready to be executed.&mdash;Poor Malefactor! my Compa&s;&s;ions are moved, and my Bowels yern towards you.&mdash;I am now to make my la&s;t Addre&s;s to you, in the Name of my divine Ma&s;ter, in Behalf of your precious Soul, ju&s;t before you &s;tep into the World of Spirits, to make your mo&s;t &s;olemn Appearance before the great and dreadful God.

and if you are yet an Impenitent and out of Chri&s;t, how &s;hock|ing mu&s;t the gloomy Pro&s;pect be! It is a great thing to die, and enter into Eternity; but to die in &s;uch a Manner, and under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, mu&s;t have &s;omething in it peculiarly dread|ful. Let me then urge and pre&s;s it upon you, with the ten|dere&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion, and yet with utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, as you love your own never-dying Soul, to think clo&s;ely of the dreadful Scene now opening upon you. Think how you will appear before a God of inflexible Ju&s;tice, that will by no Means clear the Guilty. What, O! what have you, poor Criminal, to re|commend you to his Love and Favour?</P>
<P>Since your Condemnation, I have &s;hewn you what Confe&s;|&s;ion you ought to make for your abu&s;e to the Public; al&s;o how you ought to repent, and cry to God with all your Might, if perhaps the Wickedne&s;s of your Heart and Life may be for|given you, and Mercy extended to your immortal Soul, thro' Je&s;us the only Saviour; that he would renew you by the pow|erful Influence of his holy Spirit, ju&s;tify you by the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and yet meeten and prepare you for eternal Felicity&punc; I al&s;o told you that the Go&s;pel conditi|on of Life, is Faith in the Son of God; which I endeavour'd al&s;o, in the cleare&s;t Manner I cou'd, to explain to you. Now poor Man, your Con&s;cience knows what Improvement you have made of my Advice and In&s;tructions. Whether you have ince&s;&s;antly &s;ent up your earne&s;t Cries to Heaven for renewing Grace; and whether God has enabled you, from a deep and affecting Conviction of your own Vilene&s;s and Wretchedne&s;s, Guilt and Mi&s;ery, and an effectual Di&s;covery of the Sufficien|cy, and Willingne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the Beauty, Excel|lency, and Safety of the Go&s;pel Way of Salvation by him, as has prevailed with you to comply with the Terms, and ven|ture your eternal Intere&s;t into his Hands, as knowing he is able to keep that which is committed unto him. If you have not accepted the free and gracious Offer, you are yet <HI>in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and under the Bonds of Iniquity,</HI> expo&s;ed to the Wrath and Vengeance of that God, who, out of Chri&s;t, will be a con&s;uming Fire to Workers of Iniquity. Nothing&punc; poor Heart! will &s;ave you, but an Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. You mu&s;t be ju&s;tified, clean&s;ed, and &s;anctified, in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by the Spirit of God. O! then, fly, fly
<PB N="18" REF="008356_0018_102F3C53E069E9A0">
to the Arms of divine Mercy, and lay hold on the Scepter of Grace. Repent of all your Sins, for except you repent, you &s;hall &s;urely peri&s;h; pur&s;ue a Di&s;po&s;ition to forgive your Ene|mies, and hartily a&s;k Forgivene&s;s of tho&s;e you have injured and wronged. But remember this, you can never do this ac|ceptable to God, without Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; nor is Faith a meer &s;peculative View of Truth, or a rational Conviction that gains only a general A&s;&s;ent. Human Nature has entirely warp'd off from God, and Sinners mu&s;t turn to him &s;incerely and unre&s;ervedly, or they cannot be happy. Hence God bids us look to him, come to him, tru&s;t in him, &amp;c. all which Scripture Phra&s;es intimate, that the Mind mu&s;t upon a Di&s;co|very of his Power and Ability, Love and Grace in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, turn to him, centre in him, rely upon him, and make choice of him, as its only Portion, and delight in its Choice, and &s;o love him &s;upremely, with all its Heart; from hence will natural|ly flow Grief for Sin, Hatred to Sin, Aver&s;ion from all Sin, as being what it is, and a &s;teady vigorous Endeavour after new Obedience, with a free De&s;ire frankly to forgive Mankind, as the Penitent de&s;ires to be forgiven of God. This is the Sub&s;tance of what every Child of Adam mu&s;t feel, in Order to partake in the great Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Con&s;ider then, whether you have really complied with the Terms of the Go&s;pel, and thus accepted the Grace of God, as one poor and wretched, mi&s;erable, blind and naked; morally uncapable of &s;aving or relieving your&s;elf, and in this View, have you ca&s;t your&s;elf at the Foot of divine Sovreignty, owning the Sentence of God's holy Law to be ju&s;t, and re&s;olved all your Hopes of Help and Salvation, into the meer &s;elf-moving Mercy of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that you mu&s;t be cloathed with the perfect Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us, or you can never make a comfort|able Appearance before a righteous God; for tho' God de|clares <HI>he can be ju&s;t, and yet the Ju&s;tifier of &s;uch as believe in Je&s;us,</HI> Rom. iii. 26; yet he cannot, con&s;i&s;tent with his governing Perfections, &s;ave one Soul out of Chri&s;t. It is a vain Thing therefore, for any to fling them&s;elves on divine Mer|cy, without a Regard unto Ju&s;tice, or a Reliance on the com|pleat Satisfaction that Chri&s;t hath made; for tho' God be infinitely merciful, yet he is equally ju&s;t, and all his glorious
<PB N="19" REF="008356_0019_102F3C594EA69C40">
Attributes are equally dear to him, and mu&s;t therefore per|fectly harmonize in the Sinner's Salvation: He will never rai&s;e the Honours of one, on the Ruins of another, but here whil&s;t Mercy is abundantly magnified, Ju&s;tice is gloriou&s;ly di&s;play'd. O! therefore, accept of the Go&s;pel-Offer of a Saviour, come to him as one weary and heavy laden with Sin, under a pre&s;|&s;ing Sen&s;e of your Guilt, and your peri&s;hing need of Help, and &s;urrender your&s;elf into his Hands, for here is the only Door of Hope, out of which there is no Salvation.</P>
<P>Spread all your Sins, of every Kind, before God; tho&s;e Sins that are again&s;t God only, confe&s;s to God alone; tho&s;e again&s;t Man, mu&s;t be acknowledged to Man. And it will be your Intere&s;t, poor Man, who are ju&s;t entering into a fix'd E&s;tate for a whole Eternity, who&s;e precious Soul my Heart pities; your Intere&s;t it is, I &s;ay, as well as Duty, to repent of every Sin: Repentance with any Re&s;erve, will be fatal, one Sin unrepented of, will bring certain Damnation, bani&s;h from God's Life-giving Pre&s;ence, and &s;ink you into that Lake that burns for ever and ever, which is the &s;econd Death. Now &s;hould this be your dreadful Portion (which may infinite Mer|cy prevent) con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, before it be too late, you can|not charge God with Severity, nor complain of him as unkind; then you will be convinced, &s;adly convinced, that he gave you Means, but you would not u&s;e them; he gave you Laws, but you wou'd not obey them; Calls, but you wou'd not hearken to them; Threatnings, but you contemned them; Mercies, but you abu&s;ed them; Judgments, but you defy'd them. O poor Creature! Remember, if you peri&s;h, the Fault is your own. God <HI>will be ju&s;t when he &s;peaks, and clear when he judges.</HI> O! what a glorious Reward have you often rejected? What rich Mercy have you all along de&s;pi&s;ed? What Patience and Long-&s;uffering have you abu&s;ed? Mu&s;t not all your De&s;truction then be of your own procuring, your|&s;elf being Judge? God has not fail'd on his Part, he has al|lowed you a State of Probation, provided a Saviour for the chief of Sinners, given you his Go&s;pel, &s;ent you his Mini&s;ters, repeated his Calls, lengthen'd out his Patience to this Hour, and done all that could be done in the&s;e Regards; but you have held fa&s;t Wickedne&s;s and Deceit, and refu&s;ed to turn.

Part of that is &s;pent; if you are yet out of Chri&s;t, the glori|ous and only Ark of Safety, your Ca&s;e is mo&s;t extremely dan|gerous, as your Time is ju&s;t &s;pent; having but an Hour or Two more to live, and perhaps the great Work of a whole Life, for which you were &s;ent into the World, all to do, in the&s;e few remaining Moments, or you undone for ever.</P>
<P>O! bethink your&s;elf, poor Man! for God's Sake, bethink your&s;elf, where you are going, and to whom you mu&s;t betake your&s;elf in this Hour of Darkne&s;s and Di&s;tre&s;s. Remember Chri&s;t is ready to &s;ave the chief of Sinners, even at the eleventh Hour: He &s;aved a Malefactor when ju&s;t expiring; follow the Example of that poor Thief on the Cro&s;s, and apply to Je&s;us Chri&s;t as he did, and who knows but you may find the like Acceptance. Chri&s;t is &s;till the &s;ame, his Love and Pity, his Willingne&s;s and Readine&s;s, his Grace and Sufficiency, &s;till the &s;ame as ever; and he is near to you, for he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es your Reins, and is perfectly acquainted with all your Wants, Mi&s;e|ries and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and he alone is able to &s;ave you from the Wrath to come.</P>
<P>Time urges me to fini&s;h, yet I know not how to leave you, and at the &s;ame Time at a Lo&s;s what farther Motives to u&s;e with you. My very Heart aches for your precious Soul, and I would gladly be the In&s;trument of &s;aving it from eternal De|&s;truction. Your only Safety I mu&s;t again tell you, is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but with what Arguments &s;hall I prevail with you to accept of his Grace, and be happy for ever! you are at Va|rience with the World, as a Criminal, and perhaps with Hea|ven al&s;o as a Sinner. O di&s;tre&s;&s;ing State! Fly, O fly, from the Wrath to come, and lay hold on offered Mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; cry to him, pour out your Soul before him; plead the Riches and Freedom of his Grace: Tell him he has en|couraged you to plead by former di&s;plays of his Mercy; he has pitied other Sinners, great Sinners, when in utmo&s;t Di&s;|tre&s;s, and bro't to the la&s;t Extremity; and beg that he would extend the &s;ame divine Compa&s;&s;ion to your precious and im|mortal Soul, and not leave you now to peri&s;h in your Iniqui|ties, after you have lived &s;o long in a Land of Light, under the greate&s;t Advantages; and venture your naked, guilty and polluted Soul into his Hand, tru&s;ting to his Merits, relying on his Grace, and pro&s;trate at his Foot; if you peri&s;h, re&s;olve to

peri&s;h there. Now, to conclude, what &s;hall I, what can I &s;ay more to you&punc; poor wretched Man? I can only beg and be&s;eech you, for Chri&s;t's Sake, to be reconciled to God. Spend the very few remaining Moments of Life, in reallizing that cer|tain Death, that is ju&s;t before you; and that Eternity you mu&s;t this Day enter into; and cry to God with every Breath you have yet to draw, to have Mercy upon your immortal Soul; wa&s;h it in the Blood of Chri&s;t, which clean&s;es from all Sin; give Faith unfeigned, and Repentence never to be re|pented of. And I pray &s;overeign rich Mercy may yet pluck you as a Brand, out of the Burning; give you a ju&s;t and af|fecting Sen&s;e of your Guilt and Vilene&s;s; convince you tho|roughly of your undone State, and lead you to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; accept you thro' his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, clean&s;e you in his Blood, renew and &s;anctify you by his Grace; and that tho' now you are to die as a Criminal on Earth, by the Hand of civil Ju&s;tice, yet he wou'd compa&s;&s;ionately receive you to Glory, and make you a &s;ingular Monument of his free and &s;overeign Grace, to all Eternity. Amen.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would beg leave to addre&s;s the civil Authority, here pre&s;ent, on this awful Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, tho' I have in &s;ome Mea&s;ure anticipated what I de&s;igned for the Matter of this Addre&s;s; Yet,</P>
<P>Allow me to remind you, that your Work, is not in it&s;elf, greater or more arduous, than it is nece&s;&s;ary and important to the Public. You are to be Mini&s;ters of God, for the Good of his People; in the pur&s;uit of which noble End, you mu&s;t be a Terror to Evil-doers, and a Prai&s;e to &s;uch as do Well. The executive Power of penal Laws is put into your Hands; you wear the Sword of civil Ju&s;tice, which is the Sword of the Lord; let it not ru&s;t in the Scabbard, or be worn in vain, but ever keep it drawn in the Cau&s;e of God, and the Public.</P>
<P>Suffer me therefore, with that Authority, Freedom, and Faithfulne&s;s, that becomes a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; with that Pathos and Solemnity that the Importance of the Matter calls for, and yet with all that dutiful Re&s;pect to you, as Fathers in the State, to whom Honour is ju&s;tly due, even upon the Foot of divine In&s;titution and Precept, to exhort and be&s;eech you, to put our whole&s;ome Laws in the &s;tricte&s;t Execution, again&s;t the open Contemners and Violaters of them. Let the
<PB N="22" REF="008356_0022_102F3C61C5E6C9B8">
prophane Swearer, Sabbath Breaker, the bea&s;tly Drunkard, and the covetous Thief, feel the Weight of the Law, whil&s;t they Smart under your Rod. The&s;e, my Honoured Fathers, the&s;e are Crimes not only mo&s;t flagicious in them&s;elves, but pregnant of many others; fill Heaven with Indignation, and pull down the awfull and de&s;olating Judgments of God upon the Land: Again&s;t the&s;e, and &s;uch like Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, there|fore enter into a &s;acred Combination&punc; among your&s;elves, and employ all your Power, Influence and Authority to bear them down as with a &s;trong Hand; and whil&s;t, on the one Hand, you with a becoming Vigilence, and due Severity, &s;earch out and puni&s;h Immorality, Wickedne&s;s, Debauchery and Pro|fanene&s;s; be &s;ure you neglect not to encourage Regularity, Virtue and Piety, on the other. In this Way you may expect a divine Ble&s;&s;ing on your civil Admini&s;trations, be honoured as In&s;truments of a general Reformation, in a loo&s;e and de|generate Age, and merit the Character of being the Chariots of our I&s;rael, and the Hor&s;e-Men thereof; and to your abundant Satisfaction, &s;ee Peace and good Order flouri&s;h in your Day.</P>
<P N="3">3. To conclude, I would addre&s;s my&s;elf to this numerous and crouded Auditory, convened on this mournful Occa&s;ion. O Sirs! what more awful than the Errand we are come upon this Day, to &s;ee one of our poor fellow Men, and fellow Sin|ners, receive the ju&s;t Recompence of his Crimes. Now, what can be thought of more dreadful than Sin, that furni&s;hes us with the rueful Spectacle we are a&s;&s;embled to view! Behold then in the poor contemned Criminal, as in a Gla&s;s, the vile, &s;hameful and deba&s;ing Nature of Sin, to how low a State it may bring you, and then leave you expo&s;ed to public Shame and Di&s;grace, helple&s;s and forlorn: And let this &s;ad Warning excite every one of you, my Hearers, to flee from all Sin; without Delay to reform, repent and turn to God, through Je&s;us the only Mediator, that &s;o Iniquity may not be your Ruin. Here I would particularly urge you to beware of com|mitting any known Sin, do not &s;in again&s;t the Light and Dictates of your own Con&s;ciences; this is to &s;in wilfully, and &s;o to &s;in pre&s;umptuou&s;ly, and we find no Sacrifices were ap|pointed, under the Law, for the pre&s;umptuous Sinner. Sin|ners do not u&s;ually begin with the mo&s;t flagrant Crimes, but
<PB N="23" REF="008356_0023_102F3C658CFBFD68">
they proceed from le&s;s to greater, and &s;o their Progre&s;&s;ion, is from bad to wor&s;e. Per&s;ons at fir&s;t perhaps learn to lie, then to &s;wear prophanely, then to di&s;obey their Parents, then to break God's Sabbaths, and de&s;pi&s;e his Me&s;&s;engers; from thence they proceed to pilfer and &s;teal, then to Burglary, and it may be, Murder. Beware then of the lea&s;t Sin, as that which, by &s;wift Degrees will draw you on to blacker Crimes, till it bring full De&s;truction upon you. Every Sin, how little &s;oever it may appear in your Eye, is an Evil of infinite Deme|rit, and expo&s;es to the Cur&s;e of the Law, and the Wrath of the Law-giver, both in this Life and that which is to come; and if unrepented of, will a&s;&s;uredly bring eternal Ruin. La|bour therefore every one of you more and more, to get a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Soul-damning Nature of Sin. And, O! &s;trive Day and Night, after an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, who&s;e Blood can clean&s;e you from all Sin; who&s;e Righteou&s;ne&s;s can cover your Nakedne&s;s, who&s;e Grace can renew, &s;anctify, and meeten you for his Kingdom above. Then you will be &s;afe in him, and tho' you Sin, you will have an Advocate with the Father, Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Righteous; and he that has begun a good Work in you, will carry it on to the Day of compleat Redemp|tion; then his Grace will be your Sufficiency again&s;t every Temptation, and his Spirit your Guide into all Truth, and Conducter in the plea&s;ant Ways of Wi&s;dom, and peaceful Pathes of Virtue, afford you the Te&s;timony of a good Con|&s;cience for your Rejoicing in the Hour of Death, when you re&s;ign up your Breath, and under the Conduct of Guardian Angels take wing, and &s;oar above all created Rounds, to the ble&s;&s;ed Regions of immortal Peace and Felicity, and place you in the happyfying Pre&s;ence of the glorious God, where is Fullne&s;s of Joy, and give you an honourable Seat at his Right-Hand, where are Plea&s;ures for ever more; where you &s;hall a&s;cribe Glory and Honour, and Ble&s;&s;ing and Prai&s;e to him that &s;itteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb, who loved you and wa&s;hed you from your Sins in his own Blood, and made you Kings and Prie&s;ts unto God for ever and ever. To whom belongs the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory, World without End. AMEN.</P>
