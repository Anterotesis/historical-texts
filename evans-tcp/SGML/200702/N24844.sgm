<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the fir&s;t ob&s;erva|tions, the author of the following &s;heets made, upon his return to his native country, after an ab&s;ence of &s;even years, was the extreme avidity, with which books of mere amu&s;e|ment were purcha&s;ed and peru&s;ed by all ranks of his countrymen. When he left New England, books of Bi|ography, Travels, Novels, and mod|ern
<PB N="vi" REF="032945_0005_0FF5E96A7A128420">
Romances, were confined to our &s;ea ports; or, if known in the coun|try, were read only in the families of Clergymen, Phy&s;icians, and Law|yers: while certain funeral di&s;cour&s;|es, the la&s;t words and dying &s;peeches of Bryan Shaheen, and Levi Ames, and &s;ome dreary &s;omebo|dy's Day of Doom, formed the mo&s;t diverting part of the farmer's library. On his return from captivity, he found a &s;urpri&s;ing alteration in the public ta&s;te. In our inland towns of con&s;equence, &s;ocial libraries had been in&s;tituted, compo&s;ed of books, de&s;igned to amu&s;e rather than to in|&s;truct;
<PB N="vii" REF="032945_0006_0FF5E9914ACF7C90">
and country book&s;ellers, fo&s;|tering the new born ta&s;te of the peo|ple, had filled the whole land with modern Travels, and Novels almo&s;t as incredible. The diffu&s;ion of a ta&s;te, for any &s;pecies of writing, through all ranks, in &s;o &s;hort a time, would appear impracticable to a European. The pea&s;ant of Europe mu&s;t fir&s;t be taught to read, before he can acquire a ta&s;te in letters. In New England, the work is half completed. In no other country are there &s;o many people, in proportion to its numbers, who can read and write; and therefore,
<PB N="viii" REF="032945_0007_0FF5E96C89A2ACC0">
no &s;ooner was a ta&s;te for amu&s;ing literature diffu&s;ed than all orders of country life, with one accord, for|&s;ook the &s;ober &s;ermons and Practi|cal Pieties of their fathers, for the gay &s;tories and &s;plendid impieties of the Traveller and the Noveli&s;t. The worthy farmer no longer fatigued him&s;elf with Bunyan's Pilgrim up the "hill of difficulty" or through the "&s;lough of de&s;pond;" but quaff|ed wine with Brydone in the her|mitage of Ve&s;uvius, or &s;ported with Bruce on the fairy land of Aby&s;in|ia: while Dolly, the diary maid, and Jonathan, the hired man, threw a|&s;ide
<PB N="ix" REF="032945_0008_0FF5E99352F42088">
the ballad of the cruel &s;tep|mother, over which they had &s;o oft|en wept in concert, and now a|mu&s;ed them&s;elves into &s;o agreeable a terrour, with the haunted hou&s;es and hobgobblins of Mrs. Ratcliffe, that they were both afraid to &s;leep a|lone.</P>
<P>While this love of literature, however frivolous, is plea&s;ing to the man of letters, there are two things to be deplored. The fir&s;t is that, while &s;o many books are vended, they are not of our own manufac|ture. If our wives and daughters
<PB N="x" REF="032945_0009_0FF5E970986F9D80">
will wear gauze and ribbands, it is a pity, they are not wrought in our own looms. The &s;econd mi&s;|fortune is that Novels, being the picture of the times, the New En|gland reader is in&s;en&s;ibly taught to admire the levity, and often the vices of the parent country. While the fancy is enchanted, the heart is cor|rupted. The farmer's daughter, while &s;he pities the misfortune of &s;ome modern heroine, is expo&s;ed to the attacks of vice, from which her ignorance would have formed her &s;ure&s;t &s;hield. If the Engli&s;h Nov|el does not inculcate vice, it at
<PB N="xi" REF="032945_0010_0FF5E96E0ECB6E08">
lea&s;t impre&s;&s;es on the young mind an erroneous idea of the world, in which &s;he is to live. It paints the manners, cu&s;toms, and habits of a &s;trange country; excites a fondne&s;s for fal&s;e &s;plendour; and renders the home&s;pun habits of her own coun|try di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>There are two things wanted, &s;aid a friend to the author: that we write our own books of amu&s;ement, and that they exhibit our own man|ners. Why then do you not write the hi&s;tory of your own life? The first part of it, if not highly intere&s;t|ing,
<PB N="xii" REF="032945_0011_0FF5E9729AF21DF8">
would at lea&s;t di&s;play a portrait of New England manners, hitherto unattempted. Your captivity a|mong the Algerines, with &s;ome no|tices of the manners of that fero|cious race, &s;o dreaded by commercial powers, and &s;o little known in our country, would be intere&s;ting; and I &s;ee no advantage the Novel writer can have over you, unle&s;s your read|ers &s;hould be of the &s;entiment of the young lady, mentioned by Addi&s;on in his &s;pectator, who, he informs us, borrowed Plutarch's lives; and, af|ter reading the fir&s;t volume, with infinite delight, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be a

<P>The Author giveth an Account of his gallant Ance&s;tor, Captain John Underhill, his Arrival in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and Per&s;ecu|tion by the fir&s;t Settlers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I DERIVE my birth from one of the fir&s;t emigrants to New England, being lineally de&s;cended from Captain John Underhill, who came into the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts
<PB N="26" REF="032945_0023_0FF5E9D46EA62380">
in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty; of whom honourable mention is made by that elegant, accurate, and intere&s;ting hi&s;torian, the Reverend Jeremy Belknap, in his Hi&s;tory of New Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>My honoured ance&s;tor had early im|bibed an ardent love of liberty, civil and religious, by his &s;ervice as a &s;oldier among the Dutch, in their glorious and &s;ucce&s;s|ful &s;truggle for freedom, with Philip the &s;econd of Spain; when, though quite a youth, he held a commi&s;&s;ion in the Earl of Leice&s;ter's own troop of guards, who was then &s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that brave people, by the renowned Queen Eliza|beth of England.</P>
<P>The extravagant pa&s;&s;ion, which that prince&s;s was &s;uppo&s;ed to entertain for va|rious male favourites, which occa&s;ioned the di&s;grace of one, and the prema|ture death of another, while it has fur|ni&s;hed a darling theme to the noveli&s;t, and
<PB N="27" REF="032945_0024_0FF5E9A384432BD8">
has been wept over in the tragic &s;cene, has never yet received the &s;ober &s;anction of the hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>A traditional family anecdote, while it places the affection of the queen for Leice&s;ter beyond doubt, may not be un|plea&s;ing to the learned reader, and may benefit the Engli&s;h hi&s;toriographer.</P>
<P>It is well known that this crafty queen, though repeatedly &s;olicited, never effica|ciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Netherlanders, until their affairs were apparently at the lowe&s;t ebb, and they in &s;uch de&s;perate circum|&s;tances, as to offer the &s;overeignty of their country to her general, the Earl of Leice&s;ter. Captain Underhill carried the di&s;patches to England, and delivered them at the office of Lord Burleigh. The &s;ame evening, the queen &s;ent for the captain, and, with apparent perturbation, inquired of him, if he was the me&s;&s;enger from Leice&s;ter, and whether he had any private di&s;patches for her. He replied, that he
<PB N="28" REF="032945_0025_0FF5E9D5F4793A40">
had delivered all his letters to the &s;ecreta|ry of &s;tate. She appeared much di&s;ap|pointed, and, after mu&s;ing &s;ome time, &s;aid, "So Leice&s;ter wants to be a king." Un|derhill, who was in the general's confi|dence, replied that the Dutch had indeed made the offer of the &s;overeignty of their country to her general&mdash;e&s;teeming it a great honour, as they &s;aid, to have a &s;ub|ject of her grace for their &s;overeign. No, replied the queen, it is not the Dutch; they hate kings and their divine right; it is the proud Leice&s;ter, who yearns to be independent of his own &s;overeign, who moves this in&s;olent propo&s;al. Tell him, from me, that he mu&s;t learn to obey, be|fore he is fit to govern. Tell him, added the queen, &s;oftening her voice, that obedi|ence may make him a <HI>king indeed.</HI> Im|mediately after Captain Underhill had taken the public di&s;patches, the queen &s;ent for him to her privy clo&s;et, recalled her verbal me&s;&s;age, delivered him a letter for
<PB N="29" REF="032945_0026_0FF5E9A509363338">
Leice&s;ter, directed with her own hand, and a pur&s;e of one hundred crowns for him&s;elf; charging him to enclo&s;e the let|ter in lead, &s;ink it in ca&s;e of danger in his pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea, and to deliver it privately. On the receipt of this letter, Leice&s;ter was violently agitated, walked his chamber the whole of the en&s;uing night. Soon after, he re&s;igned his command, and returned to England, animated by the brighte&s;t hopes of realizing the lofty &s;ugge&s;tions of his ambition. With him Captain Underhill returned, and upon the decea&s;e of the Earl of Leice&s;ter, attached him&s;elf to the fortunes of the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, the unfortu|nate &s;ucce&s;&s;our to Leice&s;ter in the queen's favour. He accompanied that gallant nobleman in his &s;ucce&s;sful attack upon Cadiz, and &s;hared his ill fortune in his fruitle&s;s expedition again&s;t Tyronne, the rebel chief of the revolted clans of Ire|land; and, returning with the Earl into Eng|land, by his attachment to that imprudent
<PB N="30" REF="032945_0027_0FF5E9D78F3320E8">
nobleman, &s;allying into the &s;treets of Lon|don in the petty in&s;urrection, which co&s;t E&s;&s;ex his head, he was obliged to &s;eek &s;afety in Holland, until the acce&s;&s;ion of King James, in one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and three, when he applied for pardon and leave to return to his native country. But that monarch entertained &s;uch an ex|alted idea of the dignity of kings, and from policy, affected &s;o great a veneration for the memory of his predece&s;&s;or, that no intere&s;t of his friends could procure his pardon for an offence, which, in this day and country, would be con&s;idered a &s;imple rout or riot, and puni&s;hed with a &s;mall &s;ine, in that age of kingly glory was &s;uppo&s;ed to combine trea&s;on and bla&s;|phemy: trea&s;on again&s;t the queen in her political capacity, and bla&s;phemy a|gain&s;t her as God's repre&s;entative and vicegerent on earth.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. Robin&s;on, with a number of other pious puritans, having
<PB N="31" REF="032945_0028_0FF5E9A712356080">
&s;led, from the per&s;ecuting fury of the Eng|li&s;h prelates, to Holland, in one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and three, he dwelt and com|muned with them a number of years. He was &s;trongly &s;olicited to go with Gover|nour Carver, Elder Brew&s;ter, and the oth|er worthies, part of Mr. Robin&s;on's church, to the &s;ettlement of Plymouth, and had partly engaged with them, as their chief military officer; but, Captain Miles Standi&s;h, his brave fellow &s;oldier in the low countries, undertaking the bu&s;ine&s;s, he declined.</P>
<P>How he joined Governour Winthrop, does not appear, but he came over to New England with him, and &s;oon after we find him di&s;ciplining the Bo&s;ton militia, where he was held in &s;uch high e&s;timation that he was cho&s;en to repre&s;ent that town in the general court; but, his ideas of relig|ious toleration being more liberal than tho&s;e around him, he lo&s;t his popularity, and was, on the twentieth of November,
<PB N="32" REF="032945_0029_0FF5E9DA8904F5C0">
one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty &s;ev|en, di&s;franchi&s;ed and eventually bani&s;hed the juri&s;diction of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>The writers of tho&s;e times differ, as to the particular offence for which he was puni&s;hed. Some &s;ay that it was for hold|ing the antinomian tenets of the cele|brated Ann Hutchin&s;on, others that the charge again&s;t him was for &s;aying, <HI>That the government al Bo&s;ton were as zealous as the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, and as Paul before his conver&s;ion.</HI> The be&s;t account, I have been able to collect, is, that at the time when the zeal of our worthy fore|fathers burned the hotte&s;t again&s;t heretics and &s;ectaries, when good Roger Williams, who &s;ettled Providence, the pious Wheel|wright, and others, were bani&s;hed, he, with about &s;ixty other imprudent per&s;ons, who did not believe in the then popular arguments of fines, impri&s;onment, di&s;fran|chi&s;ement, confi&s;cation, bani&s;hments, and halters for the conver&s;ion of infidels,
<PB N="33" REF="032945_0030_0FF5E9A993E761F8">
&s;uppo&s;ed that the chri&s;tian faith, which had &s;pread &s;o wonderfully in its infancy, when the &s;word of civil power was drawn again&s;t it, in that age, &s;urrounded by nu|merous pro&s;elites, needed not the &s;ame &s;word un&s;heathed in its favour. The&s;e mi&s;taken people &s;igned a remon&s;trance a|gain&s;t the violent proceedings, which were the order of that day. William A&s;pinwall and John Cogge&s;hell, two of the Bo&s;ton repre&s;entatives, who &s;igned the remon|&s;trance, were &s;ent home, and the town or|dered to choo&s;e others in their room. Some of the remon&s;trants recanted, &s;ome were fined, &s;ome were disfranchi&s;ed, and others, among whom was Captain Underhill, were bani&s;hed.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by &s;ome authors, that he was charged with the heinous crime of adulte|ry, and that he even confe&s;&s;ed it. The candid American author, above named, has fallen into this error. As I am &s;ure it mu&s;t have given him pain <HI>to &s;peak evil
<PB N="34" REF="032945_0031_0FF5E9DC94A435D0">
even of the dead,</HI> &s;o I am certain he will rectify this mi&s;take in the next edition of his invaluable hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>That author informs us, page forty three of his fir&s;t volume, "That he, Captain Un|derhill, was privately dealt with, on &s;u&s;pi|cion of adultery, which he di&s;regarded, and therefore on the next &s;abbath was que&s;|tioned for it before the church; but the evidence not being &s;ufficient to convict him, the church could only admoni&s;h him."&mdash;Page forty five, "He went to Bo&s;ton, and in the &s;ame public manner acknowledged his adultery. But his con|fe&s;&s;ion was mixed with &s;o many excu&s;es and extenuations, that it gave no &s;ati&s;fac|tion."</P>
<P>The unwary reader would perhaps con|clude, that actual adultery was intended, as well as expre&s;&s;ed, in the&s;e extracts. The Reverend author him&s;elf did not advert to the idea, that the moral law of Bo&s;ton, in one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty &s;ev|en,
<PB N="35" REF="032945_0032_0FF5E9AB9D475C80">
was not &s;o lax as the moral law of the &s;ame place, in one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty four, as explained by the prac|tice of its inhabitants. The rigid di&s;ci|pline of our fathers of that era often con|&s;trued actions, expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;ometimes thoughts, into crimes; which actions in this day, even the mo&s;t preci&s;e would con&s;ider either innocent, indifferent, or beneath the dignity of official notice. The fact is, that Captain Underhill, &s;o far from CONFESSING, was never charged with committing actual &s;tatute book a|dultery. At a certain lecture in Bo&s;ton, in&s;tead of noting the referred texts in his bible, according to the profitable cu&s;tom of the times, this gallant &s;oldier had fixed his eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly, and perhaps inordi|nately, upon one Mi&s;tre&s;s Miriam Wil|bore; who it &s;eems was, at that very time, her&s;elf in the breach of the &s;pirit of an exi&s;ting law, which forbad women to appear in public with uncovered arms and nocks,

by appearing at the &s;ame lecture with a pair of wanton open worked gloves, &s;lit at the thumbs and fingers, for the conven|iency of taking &s;nuff; though &s;he was not charged with the latter crime of u&s;|ing tobacco. It was the ADULTERY OF THE HEART, of which my gallant ance&s;tor was accu&s;ed, and founded on that text of &s;cripture, "Who&s;oever looketh on a wom|an to lu&s;t after her, hath committed a|dultery with her already in his heart."</P>

<P>WHEN the &s;entence of ban|i&s;hment pa&s;&s;ed on Captain Underhill, he returned to Dover in New Hamp&s;hire,
<PB N="46" REF="032945_0043_0FF5E9E84820FA78">
and was elected governour of the Euro|pean &s;ettlers there; but, notwith&s;tanding his great &s;ervice to the people of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, in the Pequod wars, his per&s;e|cutors in Bo&s;ton would not allow him to die in peace. Fir&s;t, by writing injurious letters to tho&s;e he governed; by threats of their power; and la&s;tly, by determin|ing that Dover was within the juri&s;diction of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, they forced him to flee to Albany, then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Dutch, under the name of Amboyna.</P>
<P>The Dutch were highly plea&s;ed with the Captain, and after Dutchifying his name into Captain Hans Van Vanderhill, they gave him a command of one hundred and twenty men, in their wars with the natives.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I WAS born on the &s;ixteenth of July, Anno Domini, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty two. My mother, &s;ome months before my birth, dreamed that &s;he
<PB N="50" REF="032945_0047_0FF5E9ECCD99B468">
was delivered of me; that I was lying in the cradle, that the hou&s;e was be&s;et by Indians, who broke into the next room, and took me into the fields with them; that, alarmed by their hideous yellings and warhoops, &s;he ran to the window, and &s;aw a number of young tawny &s;avages, playing at foot ball with my head; while &s;everal &s;achems and &s;agamores were look|ing on unconcerned.</P>
<P>This dream made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on my mother. I well recollect, when a boy, her &s;troking my flaxen locks, repeat|ing her dream, and ob&s;erving with a &s;igh to my father, that &s;he was &s;ure Updike was born to be the &s;port of fortune, and that he would one day &s;uffer among &s;av|ages. Dear woman, &s;he had the native Indians in her mind, but never appre|hended her poor &s;on's &s;uffering, many years as a &s;lave, among barbarians, more cruel than the mon&s;ters of our own woods.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="032945_0048_0FF5E9BBDEFC7308">
The learned reader will &s;mile con|temptuou&s;ly, perhaps, upon my mention|ing dreams, in this enlightened age. I on|ly relate facts, and leave the reader to his own comments. My own opinion of dreams I &s;hall conceal, perhaps becau&s;e I am a&s;hamed to di&s;clo&s;e it. I will venture to ob&s;erve that, if we in&s;pect the &s;acred &s;criptures, we &s;hall find frequent in&s;tances, both of direction to duty, and forewarning of future events, communi|cated by Providence, through the inter|vention of dreams. Is not the modern chri&s;tian equally the care of indulgent Heaven, as the favoured Jew, or the belov|ed patriarch?</P>
<P>Many modern examples, of the fore|boding vi&s;ions of the night, may be adduc|ed. William Phipps, a poor journeyman &s;hip carpenter, dreamed that he &s;hould one day ride in his coach, and live in a grand hou&s;e near Bo&s;ton common. Many years afterwards, when he was knighted

by King William the third, and came from England, governour of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, this dream, even as to the &s;ituation of the grand hou&s;e, was literally and minutely fulfilled.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN my childhood I was &s;ent, as is cu&s;tomary, to a woman's &s;chool, in the &s;ummer, and to a man's, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, and made great progre&s;s in &s;uch learning as my preceptors dealt in. A|bout my twelfth year, our mini&s;ter, who made it his cu&s;tom to in&s;pect the &s;chools annually, came to our di&s;trict. My ma&s;|ter, who looked upon me as his be&s;t &s;chol|ar,
<PB N="54" REF="032945_0051_0FF5E9F0576F9A70">
directed me to read a le&s;&s;on in Dil|worth's &s;pelling book, which I recited as loud as I could &s;peak, without regard to empha&s;is or &s;tops. This &s;o plea&s;ed our mini&s;ter, who prided him&s;elf on the &s;trength of his own lungs, that, a &s;hort time after, coming to my father's, to <HI>dicker,</HI> as they &s;tiled it, about a &s;wop of cattle, and not finding my father &s;harp at the bargain, he changed the di&s;cour&s;e upon me; ob|&s;erving how delighted he was with my performances at &s;chool. What a pity it was &s;uch a genius was not encouraged. Mr. Underhill, you mu&s;t put Updike to learning. My father pleaded poverty. When I went to Harvard College, replied the mini&s;ter, I was poor indeed. I had no father with a good farm to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; but, with being butler's fre&s;hman, and ringing the bell the fir&s;t year, waiter the three la&s;t, and keeping &s;chool in the va|cations, I rubbed through, and am now what I am; and who knows, continued
<PB N="55" REF="032945_0052_0FF5E9BEE957A610">
he, but when Updike has completed his education, he may make a mini&s;ter, and po&s;&s;ibly, when my u&s;efulne&s;s is over, &s;up|ply our very pulpit.</P>
<P>My mother here interfered. She was a little &s;pare woman. My father was a large bony man; famous, in his youth, for carrying the ring at wre&s;tling; and, in his latter years, for his per&s;everance at town meetings. But, notwith&s;tanding my father's &s;ucce&s;s in carrying points abroad, my mother, &s;ome how or other, contrived always to carry them at home. My father never would acknowledge this; but, when a coar&s;e neighbour would &s;ometimes &s;lily hint the old adage of the gray mare being the better hor&s;e, he would &s;ay to his particular friends that he always was conqueror in his dome&s;tic warfare: but would confe&s;s that he loved quiet, and was of late tired of perpetually getting the victory. My mother joined the mini&s;|ter; ob&s;erving that Updike &s;hould have
<PB N="56" REF="032945_0053_0FF5E9F2DC428EE0">
learning, though &s;he worked her hands to the bone to procure it. She did not doubt, when he came to preach, he would be as much run after as the great Mr. Whit|field. I always thought, continued &s;he, the child was a genius; and always in|tended he &s;hould go to college. The boy loves books. He has read Valentine and Or&s;on, and Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe. I went, the other day, three miles to borrow Pil|grim's Progre&s;s for him. He has read it through every bit; ay, and under&s;tands it too. Why, he &s;tuck a &s;kewer through Apollyon's eye in the picture, to help Chri&s;tian beat him. My father could not an&s;wer my mother's argument. The dicker about the oxen was renewed; and it was concluded to &s;wop even, though my father's were much the likelier cattle, and that I &s;hould go that week and &s;tudy Latin with the mini&s;ter, and be fitted for college.</P>
<P>With him I &s;tudied four years, la|bouring ince&s;&s;antly at Greek and Latin:
<PB N="57" REF="032945_0054_0FF5E9C20600B670">
as to Engli&s;h grammar, my preceptor, knowing nothing of it him&s;elf, could com|municate nothing to me. As he was en|thu&s;ia&s;tically attached to the Greek, and had delivered an oration in that language, at the commencement at Cambridge, when he took his fir&s;t degree, by his direction, I committed to memory above four hun|dred of the mo&s;t &s;onorous lines in Ho|mer, which I was called to repeat before a number of clergymen, who vi&s;ited him at an annual convention, in our pari&s;h.

third was &s;ure that I &s;hould become a Wither&s;poon in divinity, from the pathos, with which I declaimed Jupiter's &s;peech to all the gods.

In June, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty, my father began &s;eriou&s;ly to think of &s;ending me to college.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHAT added to the misfor|tune, mentioned in the la&s;t chapter, a worthy divine, &s;ettled in Bo&s;ton, pa&s;&s;ing through our town, told my father, in a private con|ver&s;ation, that all the Greek I had acquir|ed, was of no other &s;ervice than fitting me for college. My father was a&s;toni&s;hed. He was a plain unlettered man, of &s;trong natural abilities. Pray, Reverend Sir, &s;aid my father, do they not learn this Greek language at college? If &s;o, why do &s;uch wi&s;e men, as the governours of col|leges, teach boys what is entirely u&s;ele&s;s?
<PB N="61" REF="032945_0058_0FF5E9C58B7983E8">
I thought that the &s;um of all good edu|cation was, to teach youth tho&s;e things, which they were to practi&s;e in after life. Learning, replied our enlightened vi&s;itor, has its fa&s;hions; and, like other fa&s;hions of this world, they pa&s;s away. When our forefathers founded the college, at Cam|bridge, critical knowledge in the mazes and &s;ubtleties of &s;chool divinity was all the mode. He that could give a new turn to an old text, or detect a mi&s;tran&s;la|tion in the ver&s;ion, was more admired than the man, who invented printing, di&s;covered the magnetic powers, or con|trived an in&s;trument of agriculture, which &s;hould abridge the labour of the hu&s;band|man. The books of our faith, with the voluminous commentaries of the fathers, being originally written, in what are now called, the dead languages, the knowledge of tho&s;e languages was then nece&s;&s;ary, for the accompli&s;hment of the fa&s;hionable &s;cholar. The moderns, of New England,
<PB N="62" REF="032945_0059_0FF5E9F88D085978">
have cea&s;ed to intere&s;t them&s;elves in the di&s;putes, whether a civil oath may be ad|mini&s;tered to an unregenerate man; or, whether &s;ouls, exi&s;ting merely in the con|templation of Deity, are capable of actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Fa&s;hion has given a new direction to the pur&s;uits of the learned. They no longer &s;oar into the regions of in|finite &s;pace; but endeavour, by the aid of natural and moral philo&s;ophy, to a|mend the manners and better the condi|tion of man: and the college, at Cam|bridge, may be a&s;&s;imilated to an old beau, with his pocket holes under his arm pits, the &s;kirts of his coat to his ancles, and three gro&s;s of buttons on his breeches; looking with contempt on the more ea&s;y, u&s;eful garb of the pre&s;ent day, for deviat|ing from what was fa&s;hionable in his youth.</P>
<P>But, inquired my father, is there not &s;ome valuable knowledge contained in tho&s;e Greek books? All that is u&s;eful in
<PB N="63" REF="032945_0060_0FF5E9C82DE5A240">
them, replied our vi&s;itor, is already tran&s;|lated into Engli&s;h; and more of the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit may be imbibed, from tran&s;|lations, than mo&s;t &s;cholars would be a|ble to extract, from the originals, if they even availed them&s;elves of &s;uch an ac|quaintance with that language, as is u&s;ually acquired, at college.</P>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> replied my father, do you call them dead languages. It appears to me now, that confining a lad of lively genius to the &s;tudy of them, for five or &s;ix of the mo&s;t precious years of his youth, is like the ingenious cruelty of tho&s;e tyrants, I have heard of, who chained the living and the dead together. If Updike went to college, I &s;hould wi&s;h he would learn, not <HI>hard words,</HI> but <HI>u&s;eful things.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;pake of governours of col|leges, continued our vi&s;itor. Let me ob|&s;erve, as an apology, for the concern they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have, in this er|rour, that they are moral, worthy men,
<PB N="64" REF="032945_0061_0FF5E9FB1094D7B0">
who have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame dull routine of education, and who&s;e knowledge is nece&s;|&s;arily confined to the&s;e defunct languages. They mu&s;t teach their pupils what they know, not what they do not know. That mea&s;ure, which was mea&s;ured unto them, they mete out, mo&s;t liberally, unto others.</P>
<P>Should not the legi&s;lature, as the fathers of the people, interfere, inquired my fa|ther? We will not talk politics, at this time, replied our vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>My father was now determined that I &s;hould not go to college. He concealed this conver&s;ation from me, and I was left to be proud of my Greek. The little ad|vantage, this decea&s;ed language has &s;ince been to me, has often cau&s;ed me &s;orely to regret the mi&s;pen&s;e of time, in acquiring it. The French make it no part of their academical &s;tudies. Voltaire, D'Alem|bert, and Diderot, when they completed their education, were probably ignorant of the <HI>cognata tempora</HI> of a Geek verb.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="032945_0062_0FF5E9CA2E754F80">
It was re&s;olved that I &s;hould labour on my father's farm; but alas! a ta&s;te for Greek had quite eradicated a love for la|bour. Poring &s;o inten&s;ely on Homer and Virgil had &s;o completely filled my brain with the heathen mythology, that I imagined a Hamadryade in every &s;apling, a Naiad in every puddle; and expected to hear the &s;obbings of the infant Fauns, as I turned the furrow. I gave Greek names to all our farming tools; and cheer|ed the cattle with hexameter ver&s;e. My father's hired men, after a tedious day's labour in the woods, in&s;pecting our &s;tores, for refre&s;hment, in&s;tead of the cu&s;tomary bread and chee&s;e and brandy, found Ho|mer's Iliad, Virgil Delphini and Schreve|lius's Lexicon, in the ba&s;ket.</P>
<P>After I had worked on the farm &s;ome months, having killed a fat heifer of my father's, upon which the family depend|ed for their winter's beef, covered it with green boughs, and laid it in the &s;hade to

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY our mini&s;ter's recommend|ation, I was engaged to keep a &s;chool, in a neighbouring town, &s;o &s;oon as our fall's work was over.</P>
<P>How my heart dilated with the pro&s;|pect, in the tedious interval, previous to my entering upon my &s;chool. How oft|en have I &s;tood &s;u&s;pended over my dung fork, and anticipated my &s;cholars, &s;eated
<PB N="68" REF="032945_0065_0FF5E9FEA18FCC00">
in awful &s;ilence around me, my arm chair and birchen &s;ceptre of authority. There was an echo in my father's &s;heep pa&s;ture. More than once have I repaired there a|lone, and exclaimed with a loud voice, is MASTER Updike Underhill at home? I would &s;peak with MASTER Under|hill, for the plea&s;ure of hearing how my title &s;ounded. Do&s;t thou &s;mile, indig|nant reader, pau&s;e and recollect if the&s;e &s;en&s;ations have not been familiar to thee, at &s;ometime in thy life. If thou an&s;wer|e&s;t di&s;dainfully&mdash;no&mdash;then I aver thou ha&s;t never been a corporal in the militia, or a &s;ophimore at college.</P>
<P>At times, I however entertained le&s;s plea&s;ing, but more rational contemplations on my pro&s;pects. As I had been once unmercifully whipt, for detecting my ma&s;|ter in a fal&s;e concord, I re&s;olved to be mild in my government, to avoid all manual cor|rection, and doubted not by the&s;e means to &s;ecure the love and re&s;pect of my pupils.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="032945_0066_0FF5E9CDB85090A0">
In the interim of &s;chool hours, and in tho&s;e peaceful intervals, when my pupils were engaged in &s;tudy, I hoped to indulge my&s;elf with my favourite Greek. I ex|pected to be overwhelmed with the grati|tude of their parents, for pouring the fre&s;h in&s;truction over the minds of their children, and teaching their young ideas how to &s;hoot. I anticipated indepen|dence from my &s;alary, which was to be e|qual to four dollars, hard money, per month, and my boarding; and expected to find amu&s;ement and plea&s;ure among the circles of the young, and to derive infor|mation and delight from the cla&s;&s;ic con|ver&s;e of the mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>In due time my ambition was gratified, and I placed at the head of a &s;chool, con|&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ixty &s;cholars. Excepting three or four overgrown boys of eighteen, the 'generality of them were under the age of &s;even years. Perhaps a more rag|ged, ill bred, ignorant &s;et, never were col|lected,
<PB N="70" REF="032945_0067_0FF5EA23BB764E28">
for the puni&s;hment of a poor peda|gogue. To &s;tudy in &s;chool was impo&s;&s;i|ble. In&s;tead of the &s;ilence I anticipated, there was an ince&s;&s;ant clamour. Pre|dominant among the jarring &s;ounds were, Sir, may I read? May I &s;pell? Ma&s;ter, may I go out? Will ma&s;ter mend my pen? What with the pouting of the &s;mall children, &s;ent to &s;chool, not to learn, but to keep them out of "harm's way," and the gruff &s;urly complaints of the larger ones, I was nearly di&s;tracted. Homer's <HI>poluphlo&s;boio thala&s;&s;es,</HI> roaring &s;ea, was a whi&s;per to it. My re&s;olution, to avoid beating of them, made me invent &s;mall puni&s;hments, which often have a &s;alutary impre&s;&s;ion, on delicate minds; but they were in&s;en&s;ible to &s;hame. The putting of a paper fool's cap on one, and ordering an|other under my great chair, only excited mirth in the &s;chool; which the very de|linquents them&s;elves often increa&s;ed, by loud peals of laughter. Going, one fro&s;|ty

morning, into my &s;chool, I found one of the larger boys &s;itting by the fire in my arm chair. I gently reque&s;ted him to re|move. He replied that he would, when he had warmed him&s;elf; "father finds wood, and not you." To have my throne u&s;urped, in the face of the whole &s;chool, &s;hook my government to the centre. I immediately &s;natched my two foot rule, and laid it pretty &s;martly acro&s;s his back. He quitted the chair, muttering that he would tell father. I found his threats of more con&s;equence than I apprehended. The &s;ame afternoon, a tall, raw boned man called me to the door; immediately col|lering me with one hand, and holding a cart whip over my head with the other; with fury in his face, he vowed he would whip the &s;kin from my bones, if ever I &s;truck Jotham again&punc; ay, he would do it that very moment, if he was not afraid I would take the law of him. This was the only in&s;tance of the overwhelming grati|tude
<PB N="72" REF="032945_0069_0FF5EA00A7343970">
of parents I received. The next day, it was reported all over town, what a cruel man the ma&s;ter was. "Poor Jotham came into &s;chool, half frozen and near fainting; ma&s;ter had been &s;itting a whole hour by the warm fire; he only begged him to let him warm him&s;elf a little, when the ma&s;ter ro&s;e in a rage, and cut open his head with the tongs, and his life was de&s;paired of."</P>
<P>Fatigued with the vexations of my &s;chool, I one evening repaired to the tav|ern, and mixed with &s;ome of the young men of the town. Their conver&s;ation I could not reli&s;h; mine they could not comprehend. The &s;ubject of race hor&s;es being introduced, I ventured to de&s;cant upon Xanthus, the immortal cour&s;er of Achilles. They had never heard of '&s;quire Achilles, or his hor&s;e; but they offered to bet two to one, that Bajazet, the Old Roan, or the deacon's mare, Pumpkin and Milk, would beat him, and challenged me to appoint time and place.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="032945_0070_0FF5EA3433D33A28">
Nor was I more acceptable among the young women. Being invited to &s;pend an evening, after a quilting, I thought this a happy opportunity to introduce Andromache, the wife of the great Hec|tor, at her loom; and Penelope, the faith|ful wife of Uly&s;&s;es, weaving her &s;even years web. This was received with a &s;tupid &s;tare, until I mentioned the long time the queen of Uly&s;&s;es was weaving; when a &s;mart young woman ob&s;erved, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Mi&s;s Penelope's yarn was rotted in whitening, that made her &s;o long: and then told a tedious &s;tory of a piece of cotton and linen &s;he had her&s;elf woven, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances. She had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, than, to enforce my ob&s;ervations, I recited above forty lines of Greek, from the Ode&s;&s;ey, and then began a di&s;&s;ertation on the <HI>cae&s;u|ra.</HI> In the mid&s;t of my harrangue, a florid faced young man, at the further end of the room, with two large promi|nent

<Q><L>"Fire upon the mountains, run boys, run;"</L></Q>
And immediately the whole company ru&s;hed forward, to &s;ee who &s;hould get a chance in the reel of &s;ix.</P>
<P>I was about retiring, fatigued and di&s;|gu&s;ted, when it was hinted to me, that I might wait on Mi&s;s Mima home; but as I could recollect no word in the Greek, which would con&s;true into <HI>bundling,</HI> or any of Homer's heroes, who <HI>got the bag,</HI> I de|clined. In the Latin, it is true, that AEne|as and Dido, in the cave, &s;eem &s;omething like a precedent.

<P>Di&s;appointed of recreation, among the young, my next object was the mini&s;ter. Here I expected plea&s;ure and profit. He had &s;pent many years in preaching, for the edification of private families, and was &s;ettled in the town, in a fit of enthu|&s;ia&s;m;
<PB N="75" REF="032945_0072_0FF5EA364003EBE8">
when the people drove away a clergyman, re&s;pectable for his years and learning. This he was plea&s;ed to call an awakening. He lectured me, at the fir&s;t on&s;et, for not attending the conference and night meetings; talked much of gifts, and decried human learning, as carnal and devili&s;h, and well he might, he certainly was under no obligations to it; for a new &s;inging ma&s;ter coming into town, the young people, by their ma&s;ter's advice, were for introducing Dr. Watts's ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms.

<P>As for the independence I had found|ed, on my wages, it vani&s;hed, like the re&s;t of my &s;chola&s;tic pro&s;pects. I had con|tracted &s;ome debts. My reque&s;t for pre&s;|ent

<P>I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and yearned for the expiration of my contract, when an unexpected period was put to my di&s;|tre&s;s. News was brought, that, by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the boys, the &s;chool hou&s;e was burnt down. The common cry now was, that I ought, in ju&s;tice, to pay for it; as to my want of proper government the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the boys ought to be im|puted. The beating of Jotham was for|gotten, and a thou&s;and &s;tories of my want of proper &s;pirit circulated. The&s;e reports, and even the lo&s;s of a valuable <HI>Gradus ad Parno&s;&s;um,</HI> did not damp my joy. I am &s;ometimes led to believe, that my e|mancipation from real &s;lavery in Algiers,

He now told the &s;tory of the putrified heifer, with triumph; as he had read, in the news papers, that play|ing with paper kites was the foundation of Doctor Franklin's fame; that John Locke, who di&s;&s;ected the human mind,

and di&s;covered the circulation of the &s;oul had, in the full exerci&s;e of his under&s;tand|ing, played at duck and drake, on the Thames, with his gold watch, while he gravely returned the pebble &s;tone, which he held in his other hand, into his fob; and, that the learned Sir I&s;aac Newton made &s;oap bladders with the funk of a to|bacco pipe, and was, ever after, &s;o enam|oured with his &s;ooty funk, as to make u&s;e of the delicate finger of a young lady, he courted, as a pipe &s;topper.</P>
<P>I was allowed the choice of my profe&s;|&s;ion, to di&s;cover the bent of my genius. By the advice of a friend, my father put into my hands, what he was told were &s;ome of the prime books, in the &s;everal &s;ciences. In divinity, I read ten funer|al, five election, three ordination, and &s;eventeen farewell &s;ermons, Bunyan's Ho|ly War, the Life of Colonel Gardner, and the Religious Court&s;hip.

The &s;ubject was a young man, of twenty two years of age, of a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, amiable manners, and oppulent connex|ions. He was born &s;tone blind. His blindne&s;s was in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen|&s;ated, by the attention of his friends; and the encrea&s;ed power of his other or|gans of perception. His brothers and &s;i&s;ters enriched his mind, by reading to him, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, two hours every day, from the be&s;t authors. His &s;en&s;e of feel|ing was a&s;toni&s;hingly delicate, and his hearing, if po&s;&s;ible, more acute. His &s;en&s;es of ta&s;te and &s;melling, were not &s;o remarkable. After the cu&s;tomary &s;aluta|tion, of &s;haking hands, with a &s;tranger, he would know a per&s;on, by the touch of the &s;ame hand, &s;everal years after, though ab&s;ent in the interim. He could read a book or news paper, newly printed, tol|erably well, by tracing, with the tip of his finger, the indents of the types. He ac|quired a knowledge of the letters of the
<PB N="83" REF="032945_0080_0FF5C40334B5E968">
alphabet early, from the prominent let|ters on the gingerbread alphabets of the baker. He was ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic, and had contrived a board, perforated with many gimblet holes; and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a little bag of wooden pegs, &s;haped at top, according to his directions, he could prick almo&s;t any tune, upon its being &s;ung to him. When in a large company, who &s;at &s;ilent, he could di&s;tingui&s;h how many per&s;ons were pre&s;ent, by noting, with his ear, their different manner of breathing. By the rarity or den&s;ity of the air, not perceivable by tho&s;e in company, he could di&s;tingui&s;h high ground from low; and by the motion of the &s;ummer's breeze, too &s;mall to move the loftie&s;t leaf, he would pronounce, whether he was in a wood or open country.</P>
<P>He was an unfeigned believer, in the &s;al|utary truths of chri&s;tianity. He had imbib|ed its benevolent &s;pirit. When he &s;poke of religion, his language was love to God,
<PB N="84" REF="032945_0081_0FF5EA0D52711990">
and good will to man. He was no zeal|ot, but, when he talked of the wonders of creation, he was animated with a glow of enthu&s;ia&s;m. You ob&s;erved, the other day, as we were walking on this plain, my friend, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, as I was intimate in the family, that you knew a certain per&s;on, by his gait, when at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that you could not di&s;|cern his features. From this you took oc|ca&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that you &s;aw the ma&s;ter hand of the great Creator, in the obvious difference that was between man and man: not only the gro&s;&s;er difference between the Indian, the African, the E&s;quimeaux, and the white man; but that which di&s;|tingui&s;hes and defines accurately, men of the &s;ame nation, and even children of the &s;ame parents. You ob&s;erved, that as all the children of the great family of the earth, were compounded of &s;imilar members, features, and lineaments, how wonderfully it di&s;played the &s;kill of the
<PB N="85" REF="032945_0082_0FF5EA3E89FC2318">
Almighty Arti&s;t, to model &s;uch an infinite variety of beings, and di&s;tinctly diver&s;ify them, from the &s;ame materials. You added, that the incident, you had noticed, gave fre&s;h in&s;tance of admiration; for you was now convinced that, if even all men had been formed of &s;o near re&s;emblance, as not to be di&s;cerned from each other, when at re&s;t; yet, when in motion, from their gait, air, and manner, they might readily be di&s;tingui&s;hed. While you &s;poke, I could perceive, that you pitied me, as being blind to a wonderful opera|tion of creative power. I too, in my turn, could triumph. Blind as I am, I have di&s;covered a &s;till minuter, but as certain a di&s;tinction, between the children of men, which has e&s;caped the touch of your eyes. Bring me five men, perfect &s;trangers to me; pair the nails of the &s;ame finger, &s;o as to be even with the fingers' ends, let me touch, with the tip of my finger, the nails thus prepared. Tell me each per&s;on's
<PB N="86" REF="032945_0083_0FF5EA0ED7337BD0">
name, as he pa&s;&s;es in contact before me, bring the &s;ame per&s;ons to me one month afterwards, with their nails paired, in the &s;ame manner, and I will call every one by his right name. For, be a&s;&s;ured, my friend, that arti&s;t, who has denied to me that thing called light, hath opened the eyes of my mind, to know that there is not a greater difference between the African and the European, than what I could di&s;|cover, between the finger nails of all the men of this world. This experiment he afterwards tried, with uniform &s;ucce&s;s. It was amu&s;ing, in a gayer hour, to hear him argue the &s;uperiority of the touch to the &s;ight. Certainly, the feeling is a no|bler &s;en&s;e, than that you call &s;ight. I in|fer it from the care nature has taken of the former, and her di&s;regard to the latter. The eyes are comparatively poor, puny, weak organs. A &s;mall blow, a mote, or a &s;traw may reduce tho&s;e, who &s;ee with them, to a &s;ituation as pitiable as mine; while
<PB N="87" REF="032945_0084_0FF5EA400DA9B9F8">
feeling is diffu&s;ed over the whole body. Cut off my arm, and a &s;en&s;e of feeling re|mains. Completely di&s;member me, and, while I live, I po&s;&s;e&s;s it. It is coexi&s;tent with life it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;es of &s;melling and ta&s;te are but modifications of this noble &s;en&s;e, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, through the inaccuracy of men, by other names. The flavour of the mo&s;t delicious mor&s;el is felt by the tongue; and, when we &s;mell the aromatic, it is the effluvia of the ro&s;e, which comes in contact with the olfactory nerves. You, that en|joy &s;ight, inadvertently confe&s;s its inferi|ority. My brother, honing his penknife, the other day, pa&s;&s;ed it over his thumb nail, to di&s;cover if the edge was &s;mooth. I heard him, and inquired, why he did not touch it with his eyes, as he did other objects. He confe&s;&s;ed that he could not di&s;cover the gaps, by the &s;ight. Here, the &s;uperiority of the mo&s;t inaccurate &s;eat of the feeling, was manife&s;t. To conclude,
<PB N="88" REF="032945_0085_0FF5EA10DAFD6C80">
he would archly add: in marriage, the mo&s;t important concern in life, how many mi&s;erable, of both &s;exes, are left to deplore, in tears, their dependence on this treach|erous thing, called &s;ight. From this dan|ger, I am happily &s;ecured, continued he, &s;miling and pre&s;&s;ing the hand of his cou|&s;in, who &s;at be&s;ide him; a beautiful blooming young woman, of eighteen, who had been bred with him, from child|hood, and who&s;e affection for him, was &s;uch that &s;he was willing, notwith&s;tanding his blindne&s;s, to take him as a partner for life. They expected &s;hortly to be married. Notwith&s;tanding his accuracy and verac|ity upon &s;ubjects, he could comprehend; there were many, on which he was mi&s;era|bly confu&s;ed. He called &s;ight the touch of the eyes. He had no adequate idea of colours. White, he &s;uppo&s;ed, was like the feeling of down; and &s;carlet he re&s;embled to the &s;ound of martial mu&s;ic. By pa&s;&s;ing his hands over the porcelain, earthern, or
<PB N="89" REF="032945_0086_0FF5EA419DD4B800">
plai&s;ter of Paris images, he could readily conceive of their being repre&s;entations of men or animals. But he could have no idea of pictures. I pre&s;ented him a large picture of his grand father, painted with oil colours on canva&s;s; told him who&s;e re&s;emblance it was. He pa&s;&s;ed his hand over the &s;mooth &s;urface and mu&s;ed. He repeated this; exclaimed it was wonder|ful; looked melancholy; but never a&s;ked for the picture again.</P>
<P>Upon this young man, my preceptor operated &s;ucce&s;sfully. I was pre&s;ent during the whole proce&s;s, though few were admitted. Upon the introduction of the couching in&s;truments, and the re|moval of the film from the retina, he ap|peared confu&s;ed. When the operation was completed, and he was permitted to look a|round him, he was violently agitated. The irritability of the ophthalmic mu&s;cles faint|ly expre&s;&s;ed the perturbation of his mind. After two and twenty years of total dark|ne&s;s,
<PB N="90" REF="032945_0087_0FF5EA136165F128">
to be thus awakened to a new world of &s;en&s;ation and light; to have &s;uch a flood of day poured on his benighted eye ball, overwhelmed him. The infant &s;ight was too weak, for the &s;hock, and he fainted. The doctor immediately intercepted the light with the proper bandages, and, by the application of volatiles, he was reviv|ed. The next day, the dre&s;&s;ings were removed. He had fortified his mind, and was more calm. At fir&s;t, he appear|ed to have lo&s;t more than he had gained, by being re&s;tored to vi&s;ion. When blind, he could walk tolerably well, in places familiar to him. From &s;ight, he collected no ideas of di&s;tance. Green was a colour peculiarly agreeable to the new born &s;ight. Being led to the window, he was charm|ed with a tree in full verdure, and extended his arms to touch it, though at ten rods di&s;|tance. To di&s;tingui&s;h objects within reach, he would clo&s;e his eyes, feel of them with his hands, and then look earne&s;tly upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="032945_0088_0FF5EA44A3AE56A0">
According to a preconcerted plan, the third day, his bandages were removed, in the pre&s;ence of his parents, brothers, &s;i&s;ters, friends, and of the amiable, lovely girl, to whom he was &s;hortly to be mar|ried. By his reque&s;t, a profound &s;ilence was to be ob&s;erved, while he endeavour|ed to di&s;cover the per&s;on of her, who was the object of his deare&s;t affection. It was an intere&s;ting &s;cene. The company obeyed his injunction. Not a finger mov|ed, or a breath a&s;pirated. The bandage was then removed; and, when he had re|covered from the confu&s;ion of the in&s;tant effu&s;ion of light, he pa&s;&s;ed his eye ha&s;ti|ly over the whole group. His &s;en&s;a|tions were novel and intere&s;ting. It was a moment of importance. For aught he knew, he might find the bo&s;om part|ner of his future life, the twin &s;oul of his affection, in the fat &s;cullion wench, of his father's kitchen; or in the per&s;on of the toothle&s;s, pal&s;ied, decriped
<PB N="92" REF="032945_0089_0FF5EA156735B070">
nur&s;e, who held the ba&s;on of gruel at his elbow.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing his eye a &s;econd time over the circle, his attention was arre&s;ted, by his beloved cou&s;in. The agitations of her love|ly features, and the evane&s;cent blu&s;h on her cheek, would have at once betrayed her, to a more experienced eye. He pa&s;|&s;ed his eye to the next per&s;on, and imme|diately returned it to her. It was a mo|ment big with expectation. Many a finger was rai&s;ed to the lips of the &s;pectators, and many a look, expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ilence &s;he &s;hould pre&s;erve, was ca&s;t towards her. But the conflict was too violent for her delicate frame. He looked more inten&s;e|ly; &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and &s;poke. At the well known voice he clo&s;ed his eyes, ru&s;hed towards her, and cla&s;ped her in his arms. I envied them their feelings; but I thought then, and do now, that the &s;en&s;ations of my preceptor, the &s;kilful hu|mane operator, were more enviable. The
<PB N="93" REF="032945_0090_0FF5EA4629FD8EB8">
man who could re&s;tore life and u&s;efulne&s;s, to the darling of his friends, and &s;catter light in the paths of an amiable young pair, mu&s;t have known a joy never &s;urpa&s;|&s;ed; except, with reverence be it &s;poken, by the &s;ati&s;faction of our benevolent Sa|viour, when, by his miraculous power, he opened the eyes of the actually blind, made the dumb to &s;ing, and the lame and impotent leap for joy.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I PASSED my time very a|greeably, with my preceptor; though I could not help being a&s;toni&s;hed, that a man of his acknowledged learning, &s;hould not, &s;ometimes, quote Greek. Of my acquirements, in that language, I was &s;till proud. I attributed the indifference, with which it was received in the town, where I had kept &s;chool, to the ru&s;ticity
<PB N="98" REF="032945_0095_0FF5EA1A77C99208">
and ignorance of the people. As I now moved in the circles of poli&s;hed life, I ventured, &s;ometimes, when the young ladies had &s;uch mon&s;trous colds, as that they could not, by the earne&s;t per|&s;ua&s;ions of the company, be prevailed on to &s;ing; when it had been frequently ob|&s;erved, that it was quaker meeting, to &s;pout a few lines from the Iliad. It is true, they did not interrupt me with,</P>
<LG>
<L>"Fire upon the mountains, run boys, run;"</L>
</LG>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;onorous lines of the di|vine blind bard were received with cold approbation of politene&s;s. One young lady, alone, &s;eemed plea&s;ed. She would frequently a&s;k me, to repeat tho&s;e lines of Waba&s;h poetry. Though once, in the &s;ublime pa&s;&s;age of the hero Uly&s;&s;es, hanging fifty young maidens, with his own hands, in the Ody&s;&s;ey, I heard the term, pedant, pronounced with peculiar empha&s;is, by a beau, at my back. If I had taken the hint, and pa&s;&s;ed my Greek
<PB N="99" REF="032945_0096_0FF5EA4CD001C740">
upon my companions, for Indian, they would have heard me with rapture. I have &s;ince known that worthy, indefatiga|ble mi&s;&s;ionary to the Indians, the Rever|end Mr. K&mdash;, and the modern Elliot, entertain the &s;ame companies, for whole evenings, with &s;peeches in the aboriginal of America, as unintelligible to them, as my in&s;ulted Greek.</P>
<P>I was &s;o plea&s;ed with the young lady, who approved the Greek heroics, that I determined to make my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, in me|tre, in an ode, addre&s;&s;ed to her, by name. I accordingly mu&s;tered all the high &s;ound|ing epithets of the immortal Grecian bard, and &s;cattered them with profu&s;ion, through my ode. I prai&s;ed her golden locks, and a&s;&s;imilated her to the ox eyed Juno; &s;ent her a correct copy, and di&s;per&s;ed a num|ber of others, among her friends. I af|terwards found, that what I intended as the &s;ublime&s;t panegyric, was received as cutting in&s;ult. The golden tre&s;&s;es, and

the ox eyed epithet, the mo&s;t favourite pa&s;&s;ages, in my poem, were very unfortu|nate; as the young lady was remarkable, for very prominent eyes, which re&s;em|bled what, in hor&s;es, are called wall eyes. Her hair was, what is vulgarly called, car|roty. Its unfa&s;hionable colour &s;he en|deavoured, in vain, to conceal, by the dai|ly u&s;e of a leaden comb.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Though I was engaged to watch that night, with one of my preceptor's cu&s;tom|ers; yet, as Mr. Ja&s;per T&mdash;, &s;eemed &s;o friendly and civil, I could not find it in my heart, to refu&s;e him, and replied that I would, with plea&s;ure, wait upon the gentleman. Sir, re&s;umed the bearer, you are a man of honour, every inch of you, and I am your mo&s;t obedient, mo&s;t ob&s;equious, and mo&s;t humble &s;ervant: and then, making two profound bows, in the &s;hop, and one more at the door, he re|tired. He was no &s;ooner departed, than I &s;at down, to reperu&s;e this elegant and
<PB N="104" REF="032945_0101_0FF5EA21A0E02340">
very extraordinary billet. I had no par|ticular acquaintance with Mr. Ja&s;per T&mdash;, and why he &s;hould write to me, at all, puzzled me. The fir&s;t part of the letter, I doubted not, contained an appro|bation of my ode, and a reque&s;t to be in|dulged with an explanation of &s;ome of its peculiar beauties. I began to recollect illu&s;trations and parodies, from &s;ome fa|vourite pa&s;&s;ages in the Iliad. But, what we were to do, in wa&s;ting a few charges of powder, was utterly inexplicable. At one time, indeed, I thought it an invitation to &s;hoot partridges, and bethought my&s;elf of &s;couring a long barrelled gun, which had de&s;cended as an heir loom in our family; and had, perhaps, killed Indians, on Long I&s;land, in the hands of my brave ance&s;tor, Captain John Underhill. Then again, I reflected, that the lower end of a wharf, in a populous town, was not the mo&s;t probable place, to &s;pring a covey of partridges. But what puzzled me mo&s;t,
<PB N="105" REF="032945_0102_0FF5EA526C365048">
was his punctual attention to hours, and e|ven &s;econds. My doubts were all clear|ed, by the entrance of a fellow &s;tudent, to whom I communicated the letter. He was born in Carolina, and under&s;tood the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. It is a challenge, &s;aid he. A challenge! exclaimed I. For what? Why only, repeated he cooly, to fight a duel, with Mr. Ja&s;per T&mdash;, with &s;word and pi&s;tol. Pho! replied I, you banter. Do look at the conclu&s;ion of the letter. Will you make me believe that any man, in his &s;en&s;es, would conclude, with all the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip, an invitation to give him an opportunity of cutting my throat, or blowing by brains out? You have been bred in yankee land, replied my fellow &s;tudent. Men of hon|our are above the common rules of pro|priety and common &s;en&s;e. This letter, which is a challenge, bating &s;ome little inaccuracies of grammar and &s;pelling, in &s;ub&s;tance, I a&s;&s;ure you, would not di&s;|grace

While, with one hand, he, with a deadly longe, pa&s;&s;es his &s;word through your lungs, he will take his hat off, with the other, and bow gracefully to your corps. Lord deliver me from &s;uch po|litene&s;s, exclaimed I. It &s;eems to me, by your account of things, that the principal difference between a man of honour, and a vulgar murderer, is that the latter will kill you in a rage, while the former will write you complai&s;ant letters, and &s;mile in your face, and bow gracefully, while he cuts your throat. Honour, or no hon|our, I am plaguy &s;orry I accepted his in|vitation. Come, continued my fellow &s;tudent, you con&s;ider this little affair too &s;eriou&s;ly. I mu&s;t indoctrinate you.

Why, I fought three duels my&s;elf in Carolina, before I was &s;eventeen years old; and one was for an affront offered to the negro wench, who &s;uckled me: and I declare I had rather fight ten more, than pa&s;s once, in a &s;tage waggon, over Hor&s;e Neck.

You will then turn a copper for the fir&s;t fire; but I &s;hould advi&s;e you to grant it to him. This will give him a va&s;t idea of your firmne&s;s, and contempt of danger. Your antagoni&s;t, with bani&s;h|ment from his country, and the gallows &s;taring him in the face, will be &s;ure not to hit you, on his own account.

My challenger, who had lived &s;ome years in town, as a merchant's clerk, viewing me as a raw lad, from the coun|try, that would never dare accept his challenge, when this me&s;&s;enger returned, was petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment. When a&s;&s;ured that I had accepted his challenge, as a man of courage and honour, his heart died within him.

<P>The Author is happy, in the Acquaintance of a Learned Lady.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the circle of my acquaint|ance, there was a young lady, of not the mo&s;t promi&s;ing per&s;on, and, of rather a vinegar a&s;pect, who was ju&s;t approxi|mating towards thirty years of age. Though, by avoiding married parties, mingling with very young company, dre&s;&s;|ing airily; &s;hivering in lawn and &s;arce|net, at meeting, in December; affecting a girli&s;h li&s;p, blu&s;h, and giggle, &s;he was &s;till endeavouring to ward off that invidious appellation of old maid. Upon good grounds, I am led to believe, that the charity of the tea table had added to her
<PB N="113" REF="032945_0110_0FF5EA5AA43BB220">
years; becau&s;e, from a long acquaintance with her, I could never induce her to re|member any event, however trivial, which happened before Lexington battle. The girls, of my age, re&s;pected me, as a man of &s;pirit; but I was more fond of being e&s;|teemed, as a man of learning. This young lady loved literature, and lamented to me her ignorance of the Greek. I gave her a decided preference to her rivals. She borrowed books of me, and read them with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity. From my own little library, and from tho&s;e of my friends, I procured above &s;ixty vol|umes for her; among which were Locke on Human Under&s;tanding, Stackhou&s;e's Body of Divinity, and Gla&s;s's works, not on cookery, but the benignant works of John Gla&s;s, the father of Sandiman, and the Sandimanians; in which collection I did not however omit Pope's Homer, and Dryden's Virgil: and, to my a&s;toni&s;h|ment, though I knew that her afternoons
<PB N="114" REF="032945_0111_0FF5EA2C0A991AB0">
were devoted to the &s;tructure of caps and bonnets, &s;he peru&s;ed tho&s;e &s;ixty volumes completely, and returned them to me, in le&s;s than a month. There was one thing peculiarly plea&s;ing to me, as a man of let|ters; that &s;he never made dog leaves, or &s;oiled the books; a &s;lovenly practice, of which even great &s;cholars are &s;ome times guilty. I would, at times, endeavour to draw her into a conver&s;ation, upon the author &s;he had recently peru&s;ed. She would blu&s;h, look down, and &s;ay that it did not become a young girl, like her, to talk upon &s;uch &s;ubjects, with a gentle|man of my &s;en&s;e. The compliment it contained ever rendered the apology irre&s;i&s;table. One day, &s;he a&s;ked me to lend her a dictionary. I immediately pro|cured for her the great Doctor John&s;on's, in two volumes folio. About three days afterwards, &s;he offered to return them. Knowing that a dictionary was a work, to which reference was often nece&s;&s;ary&punc;
<PB N="115" REF="032945_0112_0FF5EA5D20CEA6B0">
and, thinking it might be of &s;ome &s;ervice to every lady of her learning, I pre&s;&s;ed her to keep it longer. When &s;he replied, with the prettie&s;t li&s;p imaginable, that they were indeed very pretty &s;tory books; but, &s;ince I had lent them to her, &s;he had read them all through twice; and then inquired, with the &s;ame gentle li&s;p, if I could not lend her a book, called Rolling Belly Lettres. I was in ab&s;o|lute a&s;toni&s;hment. Virgil's traveller, treading on the &s;nake in the gra&s;s, was comparatively in perfect compo&s;ure. I took a folio under each arm, and &s;kipped out of the hou&s;e, as lightly as if I had had nothing heavier, than a late antifeder|al election &s;ermon to carry. This learned young lady was amazingly affronted, at my abrupt departure; but, when the cau&s;e of it was explained to her, &s;ome months after, &s;he endeavoured to per|&s;uade a journeyman tailor, who courted her niece, to challenge me to fight a

duel, who actually penned a challenge, upon one of his ma&s;ter's pa&s;teboard pat|terns; and, I verily believe, would have &s;ent it, by his &s;econd, if he had not been informed, that my character was e&s;tab|li&s;hed, as a man of honour.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>DISGUSTED with the friv|olity of the young, and the deceit of the antiquated, I now applied my&s;elf &s;edu|lou&s;ly to my &s;tudies. Cullen, Munroe, Boerhaave, and Hunter, were my con|&s;tant companions. As I progre&s;&s;ed in val|uable &s;cience, my admiration of the Greek declined. I now found, that Machaon and Podalirious, the &s;urgeons of Homer, were mere quacks; ignorant of even the applica|tion
<PB N="118" REF="032945_0115_0FF5EA2F9576A100">
of plai&s;ters, or the eighteen tailed bandage: and, in botany, inferiour to the Indian Powwows; and that the green ointment, of my learned friend, Doctor Kitteridge, would have immortalized a bone &s;etter, in the Grecian era, and tran&s;|lated him, with E&s;culapius, to a &s;eat a|mong the gods. In ju&s;tice to that ven|erable language, and to the learned pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Cambridge, Yale, and Dart|mouth, I will candidly confe&s;s, that my knowledge of it, was now, in the fir&s;t year of my apprentice&s;hip, of &s;ome &s;ervice to me, in now and then finding the root of the labels cyphered on our gallipots. I &s;hall mention a little incident, which hap|pened about this time, as it contains a le&s;&s;on, valuable to the reader, if he has penetra|tion enough to di&s;cover it, and candour e|nough to apply it to him&s;elf. Though I applied my&s;elf clos&s;ely to my books; yet, as hours of relaxation were recommended, by my preceptor, I &s;ometimes indulged
<PB N="119" REF="032945_0116_0FF5EA60B00B54E8">
in the dance, and in &s;leighing rides. The latter being propo&s;ed, at a time when I was without the means of paying my club, I had retired, with di&s;content, to my chamber; where I accidentally ca&s;t my eyes upon a little old fa&s;hioned duodeci|mo bible, with &s;ilver cla&s;ps, in the corner of my trunk, a pre&s;ent from my mother, at parting; who had recommended the frequent peru&s;al of it, as my guide in difficulty, and con&s;olation in di&s;tre&s;s. Young people, in perplexity, always think of home. The bible reproached me. To remove the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, and for the want of &s;omething more agreeable to do, I took up the neglected book. No &s;ooner had I uncla&s;ped it, than a guinea dropt from the leaves, which had been depo&s;it|ed there, by the generous care of my af|fectionate mother; and, by my inexcu&s;a|ble inattention, had lain there undi&s;cover|ed, for more than two years. I ha&s;tily &s;natched the brilliant prize, joined my

young companions, and re&s;olved that, in gratitude, I would read a chapter in the bible, every remaining day of my life. This re&s;olution I then per&s;evered in, a whole fortnight. As I am on this &s;ubject, I will ob&s;erve, though no zealot, I have &s;ince, in the hours of mi&s;ery and poverty, with which the reader &s;hall be acquainted, in the &s;equel, drawn trea&s;ures of &s;upport and con&s;olation, from that ble&s;t book, more precious than the gems of Golcon|da, or the gold of Ophir.</P>

In the mo&s;t &s;imple language, he would trace the latent di&s;ea&s;e, to its diagno&s;|tic; and, from his lips, &s;ubjects the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e, were rendered familiar to the unlettered man. Excepting when he was with his pupils, or men of &s;ci|ence, I never heard him u&s;e a technical term.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the autumn of one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty five, I returned to my parents, who received me with rapture. My father had reared, for me, a likely pie bald mare. Our &s;addler e|quipped me with hor&s;e furniture, not for|getting the little &s;addle bags, which I rich|ly repleni&s;hed with drugs, purcha&s;ed at Bo&s;ton. With a few books, and my &s;ur|geon's in&s;truments, in my portmanteau, and a few dollars in my pocket, I &s;at out,
<PB N="129" REF="032945_0126_0FF5EA6AE607A050">
with a light heart, to &s;eek practice, fame, and fortune, as a country practitioner.</P>
<P>My primary object was to obtain a place of &s;ettlement. This I imagined an ea&s;y ta&s;k, from my own acquirements, and the celebrity of my preceptor. My fir&s;t &s;top was at a new town&s;hip, though tolerably well &s;tocked with a hardy labo|rious &s;et of inhabitants. Five phy&s;i|cians of eminence had, within a few years, attempted a &s;ettlement in this place. The fir&s;t fell a &s;acrifice to &s;trong liquor; the &s;econd put his tru&s;t in hor&s;es, and was ruined, by the lo&s;s of a valuable &s;ire; the third quarrelled with the midwife, and was obliged to remove; the fourth hav|ing pre&s;cribed, rather unluckily, for a young woman of his acquaintance, griev|ou&s;ly afflicted with a tympany, went to the Ohio; and the la&s;t, being a prudent man, who &s;old his books and in&s;truments for wild land, and rai&s;ed his own crop of medicine, was actually in the way of
<PB N="130" REF="032945_0127_0FF5EAA085B3EE30">
making a great fortune; as, in only ten years practice, he left, at his decea&s;e, an e&s;tate, both real and per&s;onal, which was apprai&s;ed at one hundred pounds, law|ful money. This account was not likely to engage the attention of a young man, upon who&s;e education twice the &s;um had been expended.</P>
<P>In the next town, I was a&s;&s;ured I might do well, as a phy&s;ician, if I would keep a grog &s;hop, or let my&s;elf, as a labourer, in the hay &s;ea&s;on, and keep a &s;chool in the winter. The fir&s;t part of the propo&s;i|tion, I heard with patience; but, at the bare mention of a &s;chool, I fled the town abruptly. In the neighbouring town, they did not want a phy&s;ician, as an ex|perienced itinerant doctor vi&s;ited the place, every March, when the people had mo&s;t lei&s;ure to be &s;ick and take phy&s;ic. He practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s, e&s;pecially in &s;low con&s;umptions, charged very low, and took his pay in any thing and every
<PB N="131" REF="032945_0128_0FF5EA6D6131D168">
thing. Be&s;ides, he carried a mould with him, to run pewter &s;poons, and was e|qually good at mending a kettle and a con&s;titution.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT length, I fixed my re&s;i|dence in a town, where four phy&s;icians were already in full practice, of &s;uch con|trariety in theory, that I never knew any two of them agree in any practice, but in abu&s;ing me, and decrying my &s;kill. It was however four months before I had
<PB N="133" REF="032945_0130_0FF5EA6F6C368310">
any practice, except the extracting of a tooth, from a corn fed girl, who &s;pun at my lodgings, who u&s;ed to look wi&s;tfully at me, and a&s;k, if the doctorer did not think the tooth ache a &s;ign of love? and &s;ay &s;he felt dreadfully all over; and the application of a young virgin, in the neigh|bourhood, who wi&s;hed to be favoured with a private lecture upon the virtues of the &s;avin bu&s;h. I verily believe I might have remained there to this day unemployed, if my landlord, a tavern keeper, finding my payment for board rather tardy, had not, by &s;ometimes &s;end|ing his boy, in a violent ha&s;te, to call me out of meeting, and always vowing I was cute at the trade, at length drawn the at|tention of the people towards me.</P>
<P>I had now &s;ome opportunity of in|crea&s;ing my information, by in&s;pecting the practice of my &s;eniors. The principal phy&s;ician had been regularly educated. As I had been likewi&s;e, he affected to pay
<PB N="134" REF="032945_0131_0FF5EAA418BB15D0">
me &s;ome attention, on purpo&s;e to mortify tho&s;e three quacks, who, he &s;aid, had picked up their knowledge, as they did their medicine, by the way &s;ide. He was a very formal man, in manners and prac|tice. He viewed fre&s;h air highly noxious, in all di&s;ea&s;es. I once vi&s;ited a patient of his, in dog days, who&s;e parched tongue and acrid &s;kin denoted a violent fever. I was almo&s;t &s;uffocated, upon entering the room. The windows were clo&s;ed, and the cracks &s;tuffed with tow; the curtains were drawn clo&s;e round the patient's bed, which was covered with a rug, and three comfortable blankets; a large fire was made in the room; the door lifted, and the key hole &s;topped; while the Doc|tor gravely admini&s;tered irritating &s;tim|ulants to allay the fever. He car|ried a favourite practical author, in his bags, and after finding the patient's ca&s;e, in the index, pulled out a pair of money &s;cales, and, with the utmo&s;t nicety,
<PB N="135" REF="032945_0132_0FF5EA70F1E00D18">
weighed off the pre&s;cribed do&s;e, to the decimal of a drachm. He told me, as a great &s;ecret, that about thirteen years and one day pa&s;t, he had nearly de&s;troyed a patient, by admini&s;tering half a drachm of pill cochia more than was pre&s;cribed in the books. He was called the learned doctor.</P>
<P>The practice of the &s;econd town phy|&s;ician was directly oppo&s;ite. He pre|&s;cribed large do&s;es of the mo&s;t powerful drugs. If he had been inclined to weigh his medicine, I believe it would have been with gro&s;s weight, rather than troy. He was an untaught di&s;ciple of the Eng|li&s;h Ratcliffe, carele&s;s, daring, and often &s;ucce&s;sful. He was admirable in ner|vous ca&s;es, ro&s;e cancers, and white &s;well|ings. Upon the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the&s;e &s;tubborn di&s;orders, he would drive them, and the &s;ubjects of them, to a &s;tate of qui|e&s;cence. He was called the cheap doctor; becau&s;e he always &s;peedily cured or&mdash;killed.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="032945_0133_0FF5EAA62C28F268">
The third phy&s;ician dealt altogether in &s;imples. The only compound he ever gave, or took, was buttered flip, for a cough. It was &s;aid, that, if he did no good, he never did any harm. He was called the &s;afe doctor.</P>
<P>The fourth phy&s;ician was not celebrat|ed for being learned, &s;afe, or cheap; but he had more practice than all the other three together, for he was a mu&s;ical<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Do not let guitars and fiddles po&s;&s;e&s;s thy brain, gentle reader.

<P>Sketch of an Hereditary Doctor, and a Lit|erary Quack: Critical Operation in Sur|gery.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE was another gentle|man in town, who had &s;ome preten&s;ions to the character of a phy&s;ician: even the &s;ame preten&s;ions with the crowned heads of Europe, to their wi&s;dom, power, and greatne&s;s. He derived it from his birth; for he was the &s;eventh &s;on of a &s;eventh &s;on, and his mother was a doctre&s;s. He did not indeed bear the name or rank, but I remember him with the learned; as he was &s;ometimes called to vi&s;it a pa|tient, at that critical, intere&s;ting period,
<PB N="138" REF="032945_0135_0FF5EAA8B6FC7E08">
when the other phy&s;icians had given him over; but his ordinary practice lay whol|ly among &s;heep, hor&s;es, and cattle. He al&s;o could boa&s;t of a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s, and was as proud and opinionated as the be&s;t of them; and, for aught I know, it was as in&s;tructive to hear him talk of his ring|bones, wind galls, and &s;pavins, as to hear our fir&s;t phy&s;ician de&s;cant upon his paroxy&s;ms and peripneumony.</P>
<P>Being &s;ent for, one day, to attend a man who&s;e leg was &s;aid to be broken, by a fall from a frame at a rai&s;ing, I found, upon my arrival at the patient's, that a brother of the faculty, from the vicinity, had ar|rived before me, and completed the ope|ration. He was celebrated for his &s;kill in de&s;perate ca&s;es; and univer&s;ally allowed to be a man of learning. He had pre&s;cribed a gill of burnt brandy, with a pepper pod in it, to keep up the patient's &s;pirits, un|der the operation, and took another him|&s;elf, to keep his hand &s;teady. He &s;plin|tered
<PB N="139" REF="032945_0136_0FF5EA758FABC7A0">
the fractured limb, with the bone of two pair of old fa&s;hioned &s;tays, he had cau&s;ed to be ript to pieces and bound round the leg, with all the garters in the neighbourhood. He bowed gracefully, as I entered, and regretted extremely that he had not my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;etting the bones; and with a loud voice, and the mo&s;t un|paralleled a&s;&s;urance, began to lay the ca&s;e before me, and amplify the operation he had performed. Sir, &s;aid he, when I came to view the patient, I had little hopes of &s;aving his life. I found the two le&s;&s;er bones of the leg, the mu&s;a and the tri&s;tis &s;hivered into a thou&s;and &s;plinters. While the larger bone, the ambobus, had happi|ly e&s;caped unhurt. Perceiving I could &s;carce refrain from laughing, and was a|bout to &s;peak; &s;ir, &s;aid he, winking upon me, I perceive you are one of us men of &s;cience, and I wi&s;h you to &s;u&s;pend your opinion, until a private con&s;ultation; left our conver&s;ation may alarm the patient
<PB N="140" REF="032945_0137_0FF5EAAA40678400">
too much, for you know, as the learned Galen ob&s;erves,
<Q><L>Omne quod exit in <HI>Hum,</HI> &s;eu Graecum, five Latinum</L>
<L>E&s;&s;e genus neutrum, &s;ic invariabile nomen.</L></Q>
By the way, mind, the&s;e learned languages are apt to make the profe&s;&s;ors of them ve|ry thir&s;ty. While the toddy was making, he proceeded. When I pondered this per|ilous, piteous, pertinacious, pe&s;tiferous, petrifying ca&s;e, I immediately thought of the directions of the learned doctors Hu|dibras and Mc'Fingal, not forgetting, as the wound was on the leg, the great Crook&s;hank's church hi&s;tory. When we had drunk our liquor, of which he took four fifths, by his direction a new mug was made a little &s;tronger, and we retired to our con&s;ultation.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you, &s;aid he, for not di&s;covering my ignorance, to the&s;e people; though, it is ten to one, if I had not rather convinced the blockheads of
<PB N="141" REF="032945_0138_0FF5EA7796A2B938">
yours, if you had attempted it. A regu|lar bred phy&s;ician, &s;ometime &s;ince, at|tempted this. He declared over the &s;ick man's bed, that I was ignorant, and pre|&s;uming. I replied that he was a quack; and offered to leave our preten&s;ions to knowl|edge, to the company, which con&s;i&s;ted of a midwife, two experienced nur&s;es, and &s;ome others, not &s;o eminent for learning. He quoted Cullen and Che&s;&s;elden; and I Tully and Virgil. Until at length, when I had nearly exhau&s;ted my &s;tock of cant phra&s;es, and he was gaining the atten|tion of our judges, I luckily bethought me of Lilly's Grammar. I began Propria quae maribus; and before I had got twenty lines, the opinion of the audience was ap|parently in my favour. They judged naturally enough, that I was the mo&s;t learned man, becau&s;e the mo&s;t unintelligi|ble. This rai&s;ed the doctor's ire &s;o much that from di&s;puting me, he began to be|rate them for a parcel of fools, &s;ots, and
<PB N="142" REF="032945_0139_0FF5EAAC4014EF60">
old women, to put their lives in the hands of &s;uch an ignoramus as me. This quick|ly decided the conte&s;t in my favour. The old nur&s;es rai&s;ed their voices, the mid|wife her broom &s;tick, and the whole train of mob caped judges, their &s;kinny fi&s;ts, and we drove him out of the hou&s;e in triumph. Our victory was &s;o com|plete, that, in the military &s;tile, we did not allow him to remain on the field to bury his dead.</P>
<P>But it is time to tell you who I am. Sir, I drink your health. In brief, &s;ir, I am the &s;on of a re&s;pectable clergyman, received a college education, entered into merchandize, failed, and, by a train of misfortunes, was obliged to commence doctor, for &s;u&s;tenance. I &s;ettled my&s;elf in this back country. At fir&s;t I was ap|plied to chiefly, in de&s;perate ca&s;es; where no reputation is lo&s;t, if the patient dies, and much gained, if he recovers. I have performed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;ing cures; but
<PB N="143" REF="032945_0140_0FF5EA791C9C62F8">
how I cannot tell you, except it was by allowing my patients &s;mall beer, or any thing el&s;e they hankered after, which I have heard was &s;ometimes efficacious, in the cri&s;is of a fever. But talking of drink, &s;ir, I wi&s;h your health. I believe I have never injured any per&s;ons, by my pre|&s;criptions. A powdered, burnt cru&s;t, chalk, and juice of beets and carrots are my mo&s;t powerful medicines. We can be of mutual &s;ervice to each other; nur&s;e, another mug. We doctors find this a very difficult ca&s;e. As I have borne down the&s;e country quacks, by &s;uperiour effrontery, I can recommend you to full practice. I will call you to con&s;ult with me, in difficult ca&s;es; for, as I was &s;aying, &s;ir, I wi&s;h your good health, mine are all difficult ca&s;es; and you, in return, &s;hall lend me books, and give me &s;uch in&s;truc|tions as will enable me to do good, as well as get fame and bread. The propo&s;al was rea&s;onable. I clo&s;ed with it. He
<PB N="144" REF="032945_0141_0FF5EAB0D9201D18">
emptied the third mug, and we returned to our patient. When the dre&s;&s;ings were removed, I di&s;covered that there was not the &s;lighte&s;t fracture of the fibula or tibia; but only a &s;light contu&s;ion on the patula, which would perhaps not have alarm|ed any other per&s;on, but our patient, who was a rich old bachelor. I recom|mended an emollient, which my learned brother acquie&s;ced in, &s;aying, with his u|&s;ual air, that it was the very application he intended, having applied the garters and whalebone, merely to concoct the tri&s;tis, the mu&s;a and the ambobus firmly together.</P>
<P>A young girl, at the door, &s;hewed him a wound on her elbow, which &s;he had re|ceived in &s;truggling about red ears at a hu&s;king; which he gravely pronounced to be a te&s;tula in ano. This gentleman is really a man of abilities; has &s;ince made valuable acquirements in the knowl|edge of the human machine, and the ma|teria

medica. If he could be led to &s;ub|&s;titute the aquatic draughts of Doctor Sangrado, as a &s;uccedaneum for the dif|fu&s;ible &s;timuli of Brown, he would be|come u&s;eful in the faculty, and yet &s;ee happy days.</P>
<P>The doctor kept his word. He read my books, received my in&s;tructions, and recommended me to his patients. But, as I copied my preceptor, in the &s;implici|ty of my language I never attempted to excite the fear of my patients, to magnify my &s;kill; and could not reduce three frac|tured bones in a limb, which contained but two. My advice was little attended to, except when backed with that of my pu|pil, accompanied with frequent quotations from Lilly. He obtained all the credit of our &s;ucce&s;s; and the people generally &s;uppo&s;ed me a young man of moderate talents, whom the learned doctor might make &s;omething of, in a cour&s;e of years.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A MERRY incident gave a perfect in&s;ight into the practice of the &s;ev|eral phy&s;icians I have ju&s;t eulogized. A drunken jockey, having fallen from his hor&s;e, at a public review, was taken up &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and extended upon the long ta|ble of the tavern. He &s;oon recovered his breath, and groaned mo&s;t piteou&s;ly. As his head &s;truck the ground fir&s;t, it was apprehended by &s;ome, unacquainted with its &s;olidity, that he had fractured his &s;kull. The faculty ha&s;tened, from all quarters, to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The learned, &s;crupu|lous phy&s;ician, after reque&s;ting that the doors and windows might be &s;hut, ap|proached
<PB N="147" REF="032945_0144_0FF5EA7DC6B41C38">
the patient; and, with a &s;tately air, declined giving his opinion, as he had unfortunately left at home his Pringle on contu&s;ions.</P>
<P>The cheap doctor immediately pro|nounced the wound a compound fracture, pre&s;cribed half a do&s;e of crude opium, and called for the trepanning in&s;truments.</P>
<P>The &s;afe doctor propo&s;ed brown pa|per, dipped in rum and cobwebs, to &s;taunch the blood. The popular phy&s;i|cian, the mu&s;ical doctor, told us a jovial &s;tory; and then &s;uddenly relaxing his fea|tures, ob&s;erved, that he viewed the groan|ing wretch as a monument of ju&s;tice: that he, who &s;pent his days in tormenting hor&s;es, &s;hould now, by the agency of the &s;ame animal, be brought to death's door, an event, which he thought ought to be &s;et home upon our minds by prayer.</P>
<P>While my new pupil, pre&s;&s;ing through the crowd, begged that he might &s;tate the ca&s;e to the company; and, with an audi|ble
<PB N="148" REF="032945_0145_0FF5EAB25E09ED18">
voice, winking upon me, began. The learned doctor Nominativo Hoc Caput, in his treati&s;e on brains, ob&s;erves that, the &s;eat of the &s;oul may be known, from the affections of the man. The re&s;idence of a wife man's &s;oul is in his ears; a glut|ton's, in his palate; a gallant's, in his lips; and old maid's, in her tongue; a dancer's, in his toes; a drunkard's, in his throat. By the way, landlord, give us a button of &s;ling. When we learned wi&s;h to know if a wound endangers life, we con&s;equently inquire into the affec|tions of the patient, and &s;ee if the wound injures the &s;eat of his &s;oul. If that e&s;|capes, however deep and gha&s;tly the wound, we pronounce life in no danger. A hor&s;e jockey's &s;oul&mdash;gentlemen, I wi&s;h your healths, is in his heel, under the left &s;pur. When I was pur&s;uing my &s;tudies, in the ho&s;pitals in England, I once &s;aw &s;eventeen hor&s;e jockies, &s;ome of whom were noblemen, killed by the fall of a
<PB N="149" REF="032945_0146_0FF5EA7FCD8067D8">
&s;caffold in Newmarket, and all wounded in the heel. Twenty others, with their arms, backs, and necks broken, &s;urvived. I &s;aw one noble jockey, with his nominati|vo caret, which is Greek for a nobleman's head, &s;plit entirely open. His brains ran down his face, like the white of a broken egg; but, as his heel was unhurt, he &s;urvived; and his judgment in hor&s;es is &s;aid not to be the lea&s;t impaired. Come, pull off the patient's boot, while I drink his better health. Charmed with the har|rangue, &s;ome of the &s;pectators were about following his directions, when the other doctors interfered. They had heard him, with di&s;dainful impatience, and now each rai&s;ed his voice, to &s;upport his particular opinion, backed by his adherents. Bring the brown paper&mdash;compound fracture&mdash;cobwebs I &s;ay&mdash;hand the trepanning in|&s;truments&mdash;give us &s;ome tod, and pull off the boot, echoed from all quarters. The landlord for bad quarrelling in his hou&s;e.
<PB N="150" REF="032945_0147_0FF5EAB463C92200">
The whole company ru&s;hed out, to form a ring on the green, for the medical pro|fe&s;&s;ors; and they to a con&s;ultation of fif|ty cuffs. The practitioner in &s;heep, hor&s;es, and cattle, poured a do&s;e of urine and mo|la&s;&s;es down the patient's throat; who &s;oon &s;o happily recovered as to pur&s;ue his vo|cation, &s;wop hor&s;es three times, play twenty rubbers of all fours, and get dead drunk again before &s;un&s;et.</P>

<P>Anecdotes of Doctor Benjamin Franklin, whom the Author vi&s;its in Philadelphia.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I CARRIED a reque&s;t to the late Doctor Benjamin Franklin, then pre&s;ident of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, for certain papers, I was to deliver further &s;outhward. I anticipated much plea&s;ure, from the interview with this truly great man: To &s;ee one, who, from &s;mall beginnings, by the &s;ole exertion of native genius, and indefatigable indu&s;try, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the pinnacle of politics and letters. a man, who, from an hum|ble porter's boy, had elevated him&s;elf to be the de&s;irable companion of the great
<PB N="154" REF="032945_0151_0FF5EAB6EB3B8140">
ones of the earth: who, from trundling a wheelbarrow in bye lanes, had been advanced to pa&s;s in &s;plendour, through the courts of kings; and, from hawking vile ballads, to the contracting and &s;ign|ing treaties, which gave peace and inde|pendence to three millions of his fellow citizens, was a &s;ight intere&s;ting in the ex|treme.</P>
<P>I found the doctor &s;urrounded by com|pany, mo&s;t of whom were young people. He received me with the attention due to a young &s;tranger. He di&s;patched a per&s;on for the papers I wanted; a&s;ked me politely to be &s;eated; inquired after the family I &s;prang from; and told me a plea&s;ing anecdote of my brave ance&s;tor, Captain Underhill. I found, in the doc|tor, all that &s;implicity of language, which is remarkable in the fragment of his life, publi&s;hed &s;ince his decea&s;e; and which was con&s;picuous in my medical precep|tor. I have &s;ince been in a room a few
<PB N="155" REF="032945_0152_0FF5EA85DF009D70">
hours with Governour Jay, of New York; have heard of the late Governour Living&s;ton, of New Jer&s;ey; and am now confirmed in the opinion, I have &s;ugge&s;t|ed, that men of genuine merit, as they po&s;&s;e&s;s the e&s;&s;ence, need not the pa|rade of great knowledge. A rich man is often plain in his attire, and the man, who has abundant trea&s;ures of learning, &s;imple in his manners and &s;tile.</P>
<P>The doctor, in early life, was economi|cal from principle; in his latter days, perhaps from habit. Poor Richard held the pur&s;e &s;trings of the pre&s;ident of Penn|&s;ylvania. Permit me to illu&s;trate this ob&s;ervation, by an anecdote. Soon after I was introduced, an airy, thoughtle&s;s re|lation, from a New England &s;tate, enter|ed the room. It &s;eems he was on a party of plea&s;ure, and had been &s;o much involved in it, for three weeks, as not to have paid his re&s;pects to his ven|erable relative. The purpo&s;e of his
<PB N="156" REF="032945_0153_0FF5EABC0D4F0350">
pre&s;ent vi&s;it was, to &s;olicit the loan of a &s;mall &s;um of money, to enable him to pay his bills, and tran&s;port him&s;elf home. He preluded his reque&s;t, with a detail of embarra&s;&s;ments, which might have befal|len the mo&s;t circum&s;pect. He &s;aid that he had loaded a ve&s;&s;el for B&mdash;, and as he did not deal on credit, had purcha&s;ed be|yond his current ca&s;h, and could not read|ily procure a draft upon home. The doctor, inquiring how much he wanted, he replied, with &s;ome he&s;itation, fifty dollars. The benevolent old gentleman went to his e&s;critoir, and counted him out an hundred. He received them with many promi&s;es of punctual payment, and ha&s;tily took up the writing implements, to draught a note of hand, for the ca&s;h. The doctor, who &s;aw into the nature of the borrower's embarra&s;&s;ments, better than he was aware; and was po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed with the improbability of ever recov|ering his ca&s;h again, &s;tepped acro&s;s the

room, laying his hand gently upon his cou&s;in's arm, &s;aid, &s;top cou&s;in, we will &s;ave the paper; a quarter of a &s;heet is not of great value, but it is worth &s;av|ing: conveying, at once, a liberal gift and gentle reprimand for the borrower's prevarication and extravagance. Since I am talking of Franklin, the reader may be as unwilling to leave him as I was. Allow me to relate another anecdote. I do not recollect how the conver&s;ation was introduced; but a young per&s;on in company, mentioned his &s;urprize, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great riches &s;hould ever be attended with &s;uch anxiety and &s;olic|itude; and in&s;tanced Mr. R&mdash;M&mdash;, who, he &s;aid, though in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of unbound|ed wealth, yet was as bu&s;y and more anxious, than the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous clerk in his counting hou&s;e. The doctor took an apple from a fruit ba&s;ket, and pre&s;ented it to a little child, who could ju&s;t totter a|bout the room. The child could &s;carce
<PB N="158" REF="032945_0155_0FF5EABA879AE640">
gra&s;p it in his hand. He then gave it another, which occupied the other hand. Then choo&s;ing a third, remarkable for its &s;ize and beauty, he pre&s;ented that al&s;o. The child, after many ineffectual attempts to hold the three, dropped the la&s;t on the carpet, and bur&s;t into tears. See there, &s;aid the philo&s;opher; there is a little man, with more riches than he can en|joy.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN one of the &s;tates, &s;outhward of Philadelphia, I was invited, on a &s;un|day, to go to church. I will not &s;ay which, as I am loth to offend; and our fa&s;hionable fellow citizens of the &s;outh arm of the union may not think divine &s;ervice any credit to them. My friend apologized for inviting me to &s;o hum

drum an amu&s;ement, by a&s;&s;uring me, that immediately after &s;ervice, there was to be a famous match run for a pur&s;e of a thou|&s;and dollars, be&s;ides private bets, between 'Squire L's imported hor&s;e, Slammerkin, and Colonel F's bay mare, Jenny Driver. When we arrived at the church, we found a brilliant collection of well dre&s;&s;ed peo|ple, anxiou&s;ly waiting the arrival of the par&s;on, who, it &s;eems, had a &s;mall branch of the river M&mdash;to pa&s;s; and, we af|terwards learned, was detained by the ab&s;ence of his negro boy, who was to fer|ry him over. Soon after, our impatience was relieved, by the arrival of the par&s;on, in his canonicals: a young man, not of the mo&s;t mortified countenance, who, with a &s;witch, called &s;upple jack, in his hand, belaboured the back and head of the faulty &s;lave, all the way from the wa|ter to the church door; accompanying every &s;troke, with &s;uitable language. He entered the church, and we followed.
<PB N="161" REF="032945_0158_0FF5EA8B7B357498">
He a&s;cended the reading de&s;k, and, with his face glowing with the exerci&s;e of his &s;upple jack, began the &s;ervice with, I &s;aid I will take heed unto my ways, that I &s;in not with my tongue. I will keep my tongue as it were with a bridle, when I am before the wicked. When I mu&s;ed the fire burned within me, and I &s;pake with my tongue, &amp;c. &amp;c. He preached an ani|mated di&s;cour&s;e, of eleven minutes, upon the practical duties of religion, from the&s;e words, remember the &s;abbath day, to keep it holy; and read the fourth commandment, in the communion. The whole congre|gation prayed fervently, that their hearts might be inclined to keep this holy law. The ble&s;&s;ing was pronounced; and par&s;on and people ha&s;tened to the hor&s;e race. I found the par&s;on as much re&s;pected on the turf, as upon the ha&s;&s;oc. He was one of the judges of the race; de&s;canted, in the language of the turf, upon the points of the two rival hor&s;es, and the
<PB N="162" REF="032945_0159_0FF5EAC12B225008">
&s;leeve of his ca&s;&s;oc was heavy laden, with the principal bets. The confidence of his pari&s;hioners was not ill founded; for they a&s;&s;ured me, upon oath and honour, that he was a gentleman, of as much up|rightne&s;s as his grace the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Ay, they would &s;port him for a &s;ermon or a &s;ong, again&s;t any par&s;on in the union.</P>
<P>The whole of this extraordinary &s;cene was novel to me. Be&s;ides, a certain &s;ta|ple of New England I had with me, call|ed con&s;cience, made my &s;ituation, in e|ven the pa&s;&s;ive part I bore in it, &s;o awkward and unea&s;y, that I could not re|frain from ob&s;erving to my friend my &s;urpri&s;e at the par&s;on's conduct, in cha&s;ti&s;|ing his &s;ervant immediately before divine &s;ervice. My friend was &s;o happily influ|enced by the habits of the&s;e liberal, en|lightened people, that he could not even comprehend the tendency of my remark. He &s;uppo&s;ed it levelled at the improprie|ty,
<PB N="163" REF="032945_0160_0FF5EA8E0B431E20">
not of the mini&s;ter, but the man; not at the act, but the &s;everity of the cha&s;ti&s;e|ment; and ob&s;erved, with warmth, that the par&s;on &s;erved the villain right, and, that if he had been his &s;lave, he would have killed the black ra&s;cal, if he was &s;ure he &s;hould have to pay an hundred guin|eas to the public trea&s;ury for him. I will note here, that the reader is reque&s;t|ed, whenever he meets with quotations of &s;peeches, in the above &s;cenes, excepting tho&s;e during divine &s;ervice, that he will plea&s;e, that is, if his habits of life will per|mit, to interlard tho&s;e quotations with a|bout as many oaths, as they contain mon|o&s;ylables. He may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that it will render the &s;cene abundantly more natural. It is true, I might have in&s;ert|ed them my&s;elf, and &s;upported thus do|ing, by illu&s;trations and parodies from grave authors; but I never &s;wear pro|fanely my&s;elf, and I think it almo&s;t as bad to oblige my readers to purcha&s;e the im|precations

of others. I give this hint of the introduction of oaths, for the benefit of my readers to the &s;outhward of Phila|delphia; who, however they may enjoy a &s;cene, which reflects &s;uch honour upon their country, when &s;ea&s;oned with the&s;e palatable expletives, without them perhaps would e&s;teem it as ta&s;tele&s;s and vapid, as a game at cards or billiards, without bets; or boiled veal or turkey, without ham.</P>

<P>Succe&s;s of the Doctor's &s;outhern Expedition: He is in Di&s;tre&s;s: Contemplates a School: Prefers a Surgeon's Birth, on board a Ship, bound to Africa, Via London.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I FOUND the &s;outhern &s;tates not more engaging, to a young practi|tioner, than the northern. In the &s;ea ports of both, the bu&s;ine&s;s was engro&s;&s;ed by men of e&s;tabli&s;hed practice and emi|nence. In the interiour country, the peo|ple could not di&s;tingui&s;h, or encourage merit. The gains were &s;mall, and tardi|ly collected; and, in both wings of the union, and I believe every where el&s;e,

fortune and fame are generally to be ac|quired in the learned profe&s;&s;ions, &s;olely, by a patient, undeviating application to local bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>If di&s;&s;ipation could have afforded plea&s;|ure, to a mind yearning after profe&s;&s;ion|al fame and independence, I might, &s;o long as my money la&s;ted, have been hap|py, at the &s;outhward. I was often invit|ed to the turf; and, might have had the honour of being intoxicated frequently, with the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters. An a&s;&s;ociation with the well educated of the other &s;ex was not &s;o readily attained. There was a haughty re&s;erve, in the manners of the young ladies. Every attempt at familiarity, in a young &s;tran|ger, habituated to the &s;ocial, but re&s;pect|ful intercour&s;e, cu&s;tomary in the northern &s;tates, excited alarm. With my New Eng|land ideas, I could not help viewing, in the anxious efforts of their parents and relatives, to repel every approach to innocent and e|ven
<PB N="167" REF="032945_0164_0FF5EA91A1273E60">
cha&s;tened intercour&s;e, a &s;trong &s;u&s;pi|cion of that virtue, they were &s;olicitous to protect.</P>
<P>Depre&s;&s;ed by the gloomy view of my pro&s;pects; and determined never to face my parents again, under circum&s;tances, which would be burthen&s;ome to them, I attempted to obtain practice in the town of F&mdash;, in Virginia, but in vain. The very decorum, prudence, and economy, which would have enhanced my charac|ter at home, were here con&s;trued into poverty of &s;pirit. To obtain medical practice, it was expedient, to &s;port, bet, drink, &s;wear, &amp;c. with my patients. My pur&s;e forbad the former; my habits of life the latter. My ca&s;h wa&s;ted, and I was near &s;uffering. I was obliged to di&s;|po&s;e of my books, for pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and, in that country, books were not the prime articles of commerce. To avoid &s;tarving, I again contemplated keeping a &s;chool. In that country, knowledge was
<PB N="168" REF="032945_0165_0FF5EAC75F3FB9B0">
viewed as a handicraft trade. The &s;chool ma&s;ters, before the war, had been u&s;ually collected from unfortunate European youth, of &s;ome &s;chool learning, &s;old for their pa&s;&s;age into America. So that to purcha&s;e a &s;chool ma&s;ter and a negro was almo&s;t &s;ynonimous. Mr. J&mdash;n, and &s;ome other citizens of the world, who had been ca&s;t among them, had by their writ|ings, influence, and example, brought the knowledge of letters into &s;ome repute, &s;ince the revolution; but, I believe, tho&s;e excellent men have yet to lament the general inefficacy of their liberal efforts. This &s;tatement, and my own prior expe|rience in &s;chool keeping, would have de|termined me rather to have prefered la|bouring, with the &s;laves on their planta|tions, than &s;u&s;taining the &s;lavery and con|tempt of a &s;chool.</P>
<P>When reduced to my la&s;t dollar; and beginning to &s;uffer, from the embarra&s;&s;|ments of debt, I was invited, by a &s;ea
<PB N="169" REF="032945_0166_0FF5EA93AEA19388">
captain, who knew my friends, to accept the birth of &s;urgeon, in his &s;hip. Every new pur&s;uit has its flattering pro&s;pects. I was encouraged by hand&s;ome wages, and a privilege in the &s;hip, to carry an ad|venture; for the purcha&s;e of which, the owners were to advance me, on account of my pay. I was to be companion to the captain, and have a fine chance of &s;eeing the world. To quit my home, for all parts of the union I con&s;idered as home; to tempt the perilous ocean, and encoun|ter the &s;everities of a &s;ea faring life, the di&s;ea&s;es of torrid climes, and perhaps a total &s;eparation from my friends and pa|rents, was melancholy; but the de&s;ire to &s;ee the world, to acquire practical knowl|edge, in my profe&s;&s;ion, to obtain proper|ty, added to the nece&s;&s;ity of immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and the horrours of a jail, de|termined me to accept his offer. I ac|cordingly entered &s;urgeon, on board the &s;hip Freedom, Captain Sidney Ru&s;&s;ell

My de&s;tination, as a &s;urgeon, being principally in the voyage from that city to the African coa&s;t, and thence to the We&s;t Indies; and, if I had not &s;uffered from a previous nau|&s;ea or &s;ea &s;ickne&s;s, the novelty of the &s;cene would have rendered me tolerably happy. In the perturbation of my thoughts, I had omitted writing to my parents of the places of my de&s;tination. This carele&s;s omi&s;&s;ion afterwards, cau&s;ed them and me much trouble.

zeal and &s;ubtlety of argument, than in per&s;onal appearance; for, like that fervid apo&s;tle, his bodily pre&s;ence was both mean and contemptible. When I &s;aw him, he was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;nuff coloured coat, olive velvet ve&s;t, drab breeches, coar&s;e ho&s;e. His &s;hoe buckles of the &s;ize of half a dollar.

<PB N="179" REF="032945_0176_0FF5EAFCB000E508">
men of &s;en&s;e, to the ignorant among man|kind, is at lea&s;t as twenty, thirty, or even forty nine, to an hundred. The majority of mankind are con&s;equently mo&s;t prone to errour; and, if we would atchieve right, the minority ought, in all ca&s;es, to govern. Peter continued to &s;mile archly. If we look to experience, continued Paine, for there are no conclu&s;ions I more prize than tho&s;e drawn, not from &s;peculation, but plain matter of fact, we &s;hall find an examination into the debates of all delib|erative bodies, in our favour. To pro|ceed no farther than your country, Mr. Wolcott, I love to look at home. Sup|po&s;e the re&s;olutions of the hou&s;es of lords and commons had been determined by this &s;alutary rule; why, the &s;en&s;ible mi|nority would have governed. George Wa&s;hington would have been a private citizen; and the United States of Ameri|ca mere colonies, dependent on the Brit|ti&s;h crown. As a patriotic Engli&s;hman,
<PB N="180" REF="032945_0177_0FF5EACF8E1D24D8">
will you not confe&s;s, that this would have been better than to have the&s;e United States independent, with the illu&s;trious Wa&s;hington at their head, by their wi&s;|dom confounding the juggling efforts of your mini&s;try to embroil them; and to have the comfortable pro&s;pect before you, that from the extent of their territory, their maritime re&s;ource, their natural en|crea&s;e, the a&s;ylum they offer to emigrants, in the cour&s;e of two centuries, Scotland and Ireland, if the United States have not too much real pride to attempt it, may be reduced to the &s;ame dependence upon them, as your We&s;t India i&s;lands now have upon you: and even England, haughty England, thrown in as a make weight, in the future treaty between them and the French nation. Peter, who had li&s;tened with great &s;eeming attention, now mildly replied. I will not &s;ay but that your arguments are cogent, though not entirely convincing. As it is a &s;ubject
<PB N="181" REF="032945_0178_0FF5EAFE51FC1870">
rather out of my line, I will, for form &s;ake, hold the negative of your propo&s;i|tion, and leave it to the good company, which is right. Agreed, &s;aid Paine, who &s;aw him&s;elf &s;urrounded by his admirers. Well, gentlemen, &s;aid Peter, with all the gravity of a &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of com|mons; you, that are of the opinion that the minority, in all deliberative bodies, ought, in all ca&s;es, to govern the majority, plea&s;e to ri&s;e in the affirmative. Paine im|mediately &s;tood up him&s;elf, and, as he had fore&s;een, we all ro&s;e in his favour. Then I ri&s;e in the negative, cried Peter. I am the wi&s;e minority, who ought, in all ca&s;es, to govern your ignorant majority; and, con&s;equently, upon your own princi|ples, I carry the vote. Let it be re|corded.</P>
<P>This unexpected manoeuvre rai&s;ed a hearty laugh. Paine retired from the pre&s;ence of triumphant wit, mortified with being foiled at his own weapons.</P>

<P>IN the frequent interviews I had with this celebrated republican apo&s;|tle, I never heard him expre&s;s the lea&s;t doubt of, or ca&s;t the &s;malle&s;t reflection upon revealed religion. He &s;pake of the glowing expre&s;&s;ions of the Jewi&s;h prophets with fervour; and had quoted liberally from the &s;criptures, in his Com|mon

Sen&s;e. How he came to write that unrea&s;onable little pamphlet, called the Age of Rea&s;on, I am at a lo&s;s to conjec|ture. The probable opinion attributes it to his pa&s;&s;ion for paradox; that this &s;mall mor&s;el of infidelity was offered as a &s;acri|fice to &s;ave his life from the devouring cruelty of Rober&s;pierre, that Moloch of the French nation. It probably had its de&s;ired effect; for annihilating reveal|ed religion could not but afford a diabol|ical plea&s;ure, to that ferocious wretch and his inhuman a&s;&s;ociates, who could not ex|pect a &s;anction for their cruelties, while the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of any thing &s;acred remained among men.</P>
<P>When the reign of the terrori&s;ts cea&s;|ed, an apology was expected; and, even by the pious, yet catholic American, would have been received. To the of|fended religion of his country no propi|tiatory &s;acrifice was made. This mi&s;&s;ion|ary of vice has proceeded pro&s;elyting.

He has added &s;econd parts, and made other, and audacious adjuncts to dei&s;m. No might nor greatne&s;s e&s;capes him.

<P>The Author &s;ails for the Coa&s;t of Africa: Manner of purcha&s;ing Negro Slaves.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the eighteenth of July, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty eight, I received orders, from my captain, to join the &s;hip in the Downs. I accord|ingly took pa&s;&s;age in a po&s;t chai&s;e; and, after a rapid journey of &s;eventy four miles, arrived, the &s;ame afternoon at Deal; and the next morning entered as &s;urgeon, on board the &s;hip Sympathy, of three hundred tons, and thirty eight men,
<PB N="187" REF="032945_0184_0FF5EB0730D8BED8">
Captain Sydney Ru&s;&s;ell commander; bound to the coa&s;t of Africa, thence to Barbadoes, and to South Carolina with a cargo of &s;laves.</P>
<P>We were favoured with a clear &s;ky and plea&s;ant gales; and, after a &s;hort and a|greeable voyage, we touched at Porto San|to, one of the Madeira i&s;les; where we watered and &s;upplied our&s;elves with fre&s;h provi&s;ions in abundance, to which the captain added, at my reque&s;t, a quan|tity of Madeira, malm&s;ey, and tent wines, for the &s;ick. We had a fine run, from the Madeiras to the Canary i&s;les. The morning after we &s;ailed, I was highly gratified with a full view of the i&s;land and peak of Teneriff; which made its ap|pearance the day before, ri&s;ing above the ocean, at one hundred miles di&s;tance. We anchored off Fuertuventura one of the Canaries, in a good bottom. I went on &s;hore, with the mate, to procure green vegetables; as I ever e&s;teemed them the
<PB N="188" REF="032945_0185_0FF5EAD6C804A878">
&s;pecific for that dreadful &s;ea di&s;order, the &s;curvy. Before we had reached the Ma|deiras, though I had &s;tored our medicine che&s;t with the be&s;t anti&s;corbutics, and we had a plenty of dried vegetables on board, yet the &s;curvy had began to infect us. A plentiful di&s;tribution of green veg|etables, after our arrival at Porto Santo, &s;oon expelled it from the crew. At Fu|ertuventura, I was delighted with the wild notes of the Canary bird, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t excellent of tho&s;e I had &s;een in cages, in the United States.</P>
<P>I was anxious to vi&s;it the Cape de Verd i&s;lands; but, our cour&s;e being too far ea&s;t, we ran down to the little i&s;land of Coree, to which the contentious of the Engli&s;h and French crowns have annexed its only importance. The French officers received us with politene&s;s, and were ex|tremely anxious for news, from their pa|rent country. Soon after, we dropt an|chor off Loango city, upon a &s;mall
<PB N="189" REF="032945_0186_0FF5EB051CC17728">
well peopled i&s;land, near the coa&s;t of Congo or lower Guinea, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Portugue&s;e. Our captain carried his papers on &s;hore, and, the next day, weigh|ed anchor and &s;tood in for the continent. All hands were now employed to unlade the &s;hip, and the cargo was depo&s;ited in a Portugue&s;e factory, at a place called Cacongo, near the mouth of the river <HI>Zaire.</HI> The day after our arrival at Ca|congo, &s;everal Portugue&s;e and Negro mer|chants, hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable however, by their manners, employments, or com|plexions, came to confer with the captain, about the purcha&s;e of our cargo of &s;laves. They contracted to deliver him two hun|dred and fifty head of &s;laves, in fifteen days' time. To hear the&s;e men conver&s;e upon the purcha&s;e of human beings, with the &s;ame indifference, and nearly in the &s;ame language, as if they were contract|ing for &s;o many head of cattle or &s;wine, &s;hocked me exceedingly. But, when I
<PB N="190" REF="032945_0187_0FF5EADA28FF1248">
&s;uffered my imagination to rove to the habitation of the&s;e victims to this infa|mous, cruel commerce, and fancied that I &s;aw the peaceful hu&s;bandman dragged from his native farm; the fond hu&s;band torn from the embraces of his belov|ed wife; the mother, from her babes; the tender child, from the arms of its pa|rent; and all the tender, endearing ties of natural and &s;ocial affection rended by the hand of avaricious violence, my heart &s;unk within me. I execrated my&s;elf, for even the involuntary part I bore in this execrable traffic: I thought of my native land and blu&s;hed. When the captain kindly inquired of me how many &s;laves I thought my privilege in the &s;hip entitled me to tran&s;port, for my adventure, I reject|ed my privilege, with horrour; and declar|ed I would &s;ooner &s;uffer &s;ervitude than purcha&s;e a &s;lave. This ob&s;ervation was received in the great cabin with repeated bur&s;ts of laughter, and excited many a
<PB N="191" REF="032945_0188_0FF5EB09C93B8A68">
&s;troke of coar&s;e ridicule. Captain Ru&s;|&s;ell ob&s;erved, that he would not in&s;i&s;t upon my u&s;ing my privilege, if I had &s;o much of the yankee about me. Here is my clerk, Ned Randolph, will jump at the chance; though the rogue has been rather unlucky in the trade. Out of five and twenty negroes he purcha&s;ed, he nev|er carried but one alive to port; and that poor devil was broken winded, and he was obliged to &s;ell him for half price in Antigua.</P>
<P>Punctual to the day of the delivery, the contractors appeared, and brought with them about one hundred and fifty negroes, men, women, and children. The men were fa&s;tened together, in pairs, by a bar of iron, with a collar to receive the neck at each extremity; a long pole pa&s;&s;|ing over their &s;houlder, and between each two, bound by a &s;taple and ring, through which the pole was thru&s;t, and thus twenty, and &s;ometimes thirty, were con|nected
<PB N="192" REF="032945_0189_0FF5EADBAD22A060">
together; while their conductors ince&s;&s;antly applied the &s;courge to tho&s;e, who loitered, or &s;ought to &s;trangle them|&s;elves, by lifting their feet from the ground in de&s;pair, which &s;ometimes had been &s;uc|ce&s;sfully attempted. The women and children were bound with cords, and driven forward by the whip. When they arrived at the factory, the men were unloo&s;ed from the poles; but &s;till chain|ed in pairs, and turned into &s;trong cells, built for the purpo&s;e. The dumb &s;or|row of &s;ome, the frenzy of others, the &s;obbings and tears of the children, and &s;hrieks of the women, when they were pre&s;ented to our captain, &s;o affected me that I was ha&s;tening from this &s;cene of barbarity, on board the &s;hip; when I was called by the mate, and di&s;covered, to my &s;urprize and horrour, that, by my &s;tation in the &s;hip, I had a principal and active part of this inhuman tran&s;action impo&s;ed upon me. As &s;urgeon, it was my duty to
<PB N="193" REF="032945_0190_0FF5EB0BD886CF00">
in&s;pect the bodies of the &s;laves, to &s;ee, as the captain expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, that our owners were not &s;hammed off with un&s;ound fle&s;h. In this in&s;pection, I was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Randolph the clerk, and two &s;tout &s;ailors. It was tran&s;|acted with all that unfeeling in&s;olence, which wanton barbarity can inflict up|on defencele&s;s wretchedne&s;s. The man, the affrighted child, the mode&s;t ma|tron, and the timid virgin were alike expo&s;ed to this &s;evere &s;crutiny, to hu|manity and common decency equally in&s;ulting.</P>
<P>I cannot reflect on this tran&s;action yet without &s;huddering. I have de|plored my conduct with tears of an|gui&s;h; and, I pray a merciful God, the common parent of the great family of the univer&s;e, who hath made of one fle&s;h and one blood all nations of the earth, that the mi&s;eries, the in&s;ults, and cruel wound|ings, I afterwards received, when a &s;lave

<P>OF one hundred and fifty Af|ricans we rejected &s;eventeen, as not mer|chantable. While I was doubting which to lament mo&s;t, tho&s;e, who were about being precipitated into all the mi&s;eries of an American &s;lavery, or tho&s;e, whom we had rejected, as too wretched for &s;laves; Captain Ru&s;&s;ell was congratulating the &s;lave contractors, upon the immen&s;e good luck they had, in not &s;uffering more by this lot of human creatures. I under|&s;tood
<PB N="196" REF="032945_0193_0FF5EADF4773B318">
that, what from wounds received by &s;ome of the&s;e mi&s;erable creatures, at their capture, or in their violent &s;truggles for liberty, or attempts at &s;uicide; with the fatigue of a long journey, partly over the burning &s;ands of a &s;ultry climate, it was u&s;ual to e&s;timate the lo&s;s, in the pa&s;&s;age to the &s;ea &s;hore, at twenty five per cent.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the purcha&s;e complet|ed, than the&s;e wretched Africans were tran&s;ported in herds aboard the &s;hip, and immediately precipitated between decks, where a &s;trong chain, attached to a &s;taple in the lower deck, was rivetted to the bar, before de&s;cribed; and then the men were chained in pairs, and al&s;o hand cuffed, and two &s;ailors with cutla&s;&s;es guarded ev|ery twenty: while the women and chil|dren were tied together in pairs with ropes, and obliged to &s;upply the men with provi&s;ions, and the flu&s;h bucket; or, if the young women were relea&s;ed, it was only to gratify the brutal lu&s;t of the &s;ail|ors;
<PB N="197" REF="032945_0194_0FF5EB0F6E7D0810">
for though I cannot &s;ay I ever was witne&s;s to an actual rape, yet the frequent &s;hrieks of the&s;e forlorn females in the births of the &s;eamen, left me little charity to doubt of the repeated commi&s;&s;ion of that degrading crime. The eve after we had received the &s;laves on board, all hands were piped on deck, and ordered to a&s;&s;i&s;t in manufacturing and knotting cat o'nine tails, the application of which, I was in|formed, was always nece&s;&s;ary to bring the &s;laves to their appetite. The night after they came on board was &s;pent by the&s;e wretched people, in &s;obbings, groans, tears, and the mo&s;t heart rending bur&s;ts of &s;or|row and de&s;pair. The next morning all was &s;till. Surpri&s;ed by this unexpected &s;ilence, I almo&s;t hoped that providence, in pity to the&s;e her mi&s;erable children, had permitted &s;ome kindly &s;uffocation to put a period to their angui&s;h. It was neither novel nor unexpected to the &s;hip's crew. It is only the dumb fit come on, cried
<PB N="198" REF="032945_0195_0FF5EAE25D9B1618">
every one. We will cure them. After breakfa&s;t, the whole &s;hip's crew went be|tween decks, and carried with them the provi&s;ions for the &s;laves, which they one and all refu&s;ed to eat. A more affecting group of mi&s;ery was never &s;een. The&s;e injured Africans, prefering death to &s;lave|ry, or perhaps buoyed above the fear of di&s;&s;olution, by their religion, which taught them to look with an eye of faith to a country beyond the grave; where they &s;hould again meet tho&s;e friends and relatives, from who&s;e endearments they had been torn; and where no fiend &s;hould torment, or chri&s;tian thir&s;t for gold, had, wanting other means, re&s;olved to &s;tarve them&s;elves, and every eye low|ered the fixed re&s;olve of this deadly in|tent. In vain were the men beaten. They refu&s;ed to ta&s;te one mouthful; and, I believe, would have died under the op|eration, if the ingenious cruelty of the clerk, Randolph, had not &s;ugge&s;ted the
<PB N="199" REF="032945_0196_0FF5EB1202B3AE50">
plan of whipping the women and chil|dren in &s;ight of the men; a&s;&s;uring the men they &s;hould be tormented until all had eaten. What the torments, exerci&s;|ed on the bodies of the&s;e brave Africans, failed to produce, the feelings of nature effected. The Negro, who could un|dauntedly expire under the angui&s;h of the la&s;h, could not view the agonies of his wife, child, or his mother; and, though repeatedly encouraged by the&s;e female &s;ufferers, unmoved by their torments, to per&s;evere unto death; yet, though the <HI>man</HI> dared to die, the <HI>father</HI> relented, and in a few hours they all eat their provi&s;ions, <HI>mingled with their tears.</HI></P>
<P>Our &s;lave dealers being unable to ful|fil their contract, unle&s;s we tarried three weeks longer, our captain concluded to remove to &s;ome other market. We ac|cordingly weighed anchor, and &s;teered for Benin, and anchored in the river Formo&s;a, where we took in one hundred and fifteen
<PB N="200" REF="032945_0197_0FF5EAE3E3996F10">
more &s;laves. The &s;ame proce&s;s in the purcha&s;e was pur&s;ued here; and, though I frequently a&s;&s;ured the captain, as a phy&s;i|cian, that it was impracticable to &s;tow fif|ty more per&s;ons between decks, without endangering health and life, the whole hundred and fifteen were thru&s;t, with the re&s;t, between decks. The &s;tagnant con|fined air of this infernal hole, rendered more deleterious by the &s;tench of the fae|ces, and violent per&s;piration of &s;uch a crowd, occa&s;ioned putrid di&s;ea&s;es; and, e|ven while in the mouth of the Formo&s;a, it was u&s;ual to throw one or two Negro corp&s;es over every day. It was in vain I remon&s;trated to the captain. In vain I enforced the nece&s;&s;ity of more commodi|ous births, and a more free influx of air for the &s;laves. In vain I repre&s;ented, that the&s;e mi&s;erable people had been u&s;ed to the vegetable diet, and pure air of a country life. That at home they were remarka|ble for cleanline&s;s of per&s;on, the very rites
<PB N="201" REF="032945_0198_0FF5EB14142764B0">
of their religion con&s;i&s;ting, almo&s;t entire|ly, in frequent ablutions. The captain was, by this time, prejudiced again&s;t me. He ob&s;erved that he did not doubt my &s;kill, and would be bound by my advice, as to the health of tho&s;e on board his &s;hip, when he found I was actuated by the in|tere&s;t of the owners; but, he feared, that I was now moved by &s;ome <HI>yankee non|&s;en&s;e about humanity.</HI></P>
<P>Randolph, the clerk, blamed me in plain terms. He &s;aid he had made &s;even African voyages, and with as good &s;ur|geons as I was; and that it was their common practice, when an infectious di&s;|order prevailed, among the &s;laves, to make critical &s;earch for all tho&s;e, who had the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ymptoms of it, or who&s;e habits of body inclined them to it; to tie them up and ca&s;t them over the &s;hip &s;ide together, and thus, at one da&s;h, to purify the &s;hip. <HI>What &s;ignifies, added he, the lives of the black devils; they love to die. You
<PB N="202" REF="032945_0199_0FF5EAE889B58CC8">
cannot plea&s;e them better, than by chucking them into the water.</HI></P>
<P>When we &s;tood out to &s;ea, the rolling of the ve&s;&s;el brought on the &s;ea &s;ickne&s;s, which encrea&s;ed the filth; the weath|er being rough, we were obliged to clo&s;e &s;ome of the ports, which ventilated the &s;pace between decks; and death raged dreadfully among the &s;laves. Above two thirds were di&s;ea&s;ed. It was affecting to ob&s;erve the gha&s;tly &s;mile on the counte|nance of the dying African, as if rejoic|ing to e&s;cape the cruelty of his oppre&s;&s;ors. I noticed one man, who gathered all his &s;trength, and, in one la&s;t effort, &s;poke with great empha&s;is, and expired. I un|der&s;tood, by the lingui&s;t, that, with his dying breath, he invited his wife, and a boy and girl to follow him quickly, and &s;laken their thir&s;t with him at the cool &s;treams of the fountain of their Great Father, be|yond the reach of the wild white bea&s;ts. The captain was now alarmed for the
<PB N="203" REF="032945_0200_0FF5EB159A3F3918">
&s;ucce&s;s of his voyage; and, upon my urg|ing the nece&s;&s;ity of landing the &s;laves, he ordered the &s;hip about, and we anchored near an uninhabited part of the gold coa&s;t. I conjecture not far from Cape St. Paul.</P>
<P>Tents were erected on the &s;hore, and the &s;ick landed. Under my direction, they recovered &s;urpri&s;ingly. It was af|fecting to &s;ee the effect gentle u&s;age had upon the&s;e hitherto &s;ullen, ob&s;tinate peo|ple. As I had the &s;ole direction of the ho&s;pital, they looked on me as the &s;ource of this &s;udden tran&s;ition from the filth and rigour of the &s;hip, to the cleanline&s;s and kindne&s;s of the &s;hore. Their gratitude was exce&s;&s;ive. When they recovered &s;o far as to walk out, happy was he, who could, by picking a few berries, gathering the wild fruits of the country, or doing any menial &s;ervices, manife&s;t his affection for me. Our lingui&s;t has told me, he has often heard them, behind the

bu&s;hes, praying to their God for my pro&s;|perity, and a&s;king him with earne&s;tne&s;s, why he put my good <HI>black</HI> &s;oul into a <HI>white</HI> body. In twelve days all the convale&s;|cents were returned to the &s;hip, except five, who &s;taid with me on &s;hore, and were to be taken on board the next day.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEAR the clo&s;e of the fourteenth of November, one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and eighty eight, as the &s;un was &s;ink|ing behind the mountains of Fundia, I &s;at at the door of my tent, and perceived our &s;hip, which lay at one mile's di&s;tance, getting under way, apparently in great ha&s;te. The jolly boat, about ten min|utes before, had made towards the &s;hore; but was recalled by a mu&s;ket &s;hot from the &s;hip. Alarmed by this unexpected manoeu|vre, I ran to the top of a &s;mall hill, back of the ho&s;pital, and plainly di&s;covered a &s;quare rigged ve&s;&s;el in the offing, endeav|ouring
<PB N="206" REF="032945_0203_0FF5EAEA8E3E29F8">
to lock our &s;hip within the land; but a land breeze &s;pringing up from the north ea&s;t, which did not extend to the &s;trange ve&s;&s;el, and our &s;hip putting out all her light &s;ails, being well provided with king &s;ail, &s;cudding &s;ails, water &s;ails, and driver, I could perceive &s;he out &s;ailed her. It was &s;oon &s;o dark that I lo&s;t &s;ight of both, and I pa&s;&s;ed a night of extreme anxiety, which was increa&s;ed by, what I conjectured to be, the fla&s;hes of guns in the <HI>&s;outh we&s;t;</HI> though at too great di&s;|tance for me to hear the reports.</P>
<P>The next morning no ve&s;&s;els were to be &s;een on the coa&s;t, and the en&s;uing day was &s;pent in a &s;tate of dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Although I had provi&s;ions enough with me for &s;ome weeks, and was &s;heltered by our tents, yet to be &s;eparated from my friends and country, perhaps forever, and to fall into the hands of the barbarous people, which infe&s;ted this coa&s;t, was tru|ly alarming. The five Africans, who
<PB N="207" REF="032945_0204_0FF5EB19CDA898E8">
were with me, could not conceal their joy, at the departure of the &s;hip. By &s;igns they manife&s;ted their affection to|wards me; and, when I &s;ignified to them that the ve&s;&s;el was gone not to return, they clapped their hands, and pointing inland, &s;ignified a de&s;ire to convey me to their native country, where they were &s;ure I &s;hould be happy. By their con|&s;ultation, I could &s;ee that they were to|tally ignorant of the way. On the third day towards evening, to my great joy, I &s;aw a &s;ail approaching the &s;hore, at the pro&s;pect of which my African a&s;&s;ociates, manife&s;ted every &s;ign of horrour. I im|mediately concluded that no great blame would ari&s;e, from my not detaining five men, in the ab&s;ence of the &s;hip; and I intimated to them that they might con|ceal them&s;elves in the bru&s;h and e&s;cape. Four quitted me; but one, who made me comprehend, that he had a beloved &s;on among the &s;laves, refu&s;ed to go, prefering
<PB N="208" REF="032945_0205_0FF5EAEC1C9F50F8">
the company of his child, and <HI>&s;lavery</HI> it|&s;elf, to <HI>freedom</HI> and the land of his nativi|ty. I retired to re&s;t, plea&s;ed with the imagination of &s;oon rejoining my friends, and proceeding to my native country. On the morning of the fourth day, as I was &s;leeping in my tent with the affec|tionate negro at my feet, I was &s;uddenly awakened, by the blowing of conch &s;hells, and the &s;ound of uncouth voices. I a|ro&s;e to dre&s;s my&s;elf, when the tent was over&s;et, and I received a blow from the back of a &s;abre, which levelled me to the earth; and was immediately &s;eized and bound by &s;everal men of &s;allow and fierce demeanour, in &s;trange habits, who &s;pake a language I could not compre|hend. With the negro, tents, baggage, and provi&s;ions, I was carried to the boat, which, being loaded, was immediately pu&s;hed off from the &s;hore, and rowed to|wards a ve&s;&s;el, which I now, for the fir&s;t time, noticed, and had no doubt but it was
<PB N="209" REF="032945_0206_0FF5EB1C605D2418">
the &s;ame, which was in pur&s;uit of the Sympathy. She was rigged differently from any I had ever &s;een, having two ma&s;ts, a large &s;quare main &s;ail, another of equal &s;ize, &s;eized by the middle of a main yard to her fore ma&s;t, and, what the &s;ail|ors call, a &s;houlder of mutton &s;ail abaft; which, with top &s;ails and two banks of oars, impelled her through the water with amazing velocity: though, from the clum&s;ine&s;s of her rigging, an American &s;eaman would never have pronounced her a good &s;ea boat. On her main ma&s;t head was a broad black pennant, with a half moon, or rather cre&s;cent, and a drawn &s;abre, in white and red, emblazoned in the middle. The &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el were manned as we approached, and a tackle be|ing let down, the hook was attached to the cord, which bound me, and I was hoi&s;ted on board in the twinkling of an eye. Then, being unbound, I was carried upon the quarter deck, where a man, who
<PB N="210" REF="032945_0207_0FF5EAEDA1516758">
appeared to be the captain, glittering in &s;ilks, pearl, and gold, &s;et cro&s;s legged upon a velvet cu&s;hing to receive me. He was nearly encircled by a band of men, with mon&s;trous tufts of hair on their upper lips, dre&s;&s;ed in habits of the &s;ame mode with their leader's, but of coar&s;er contex|ture, with drawn &s;cimitars in their hands, and by his &s;ide a man of lighter complex|ion, who, by the captain's command, in|quired of me, in good Engli&s;h, if I was an Engli&s;hman. I replied I was an A|merican, a citizen of the United States. This was no &s;ooner interpreted to the captain than, at a di&s;dainful nod of his head, I was again &s;eized, hand cuffed, and thru&s;t into a dirty hole in the fore ca&s;tle, where I lay twenty four hours, without &s;traw to &s;leep on, or any thing to eat or drink. The treatment we gave the unhappy Africans, on board the Sympathy, now came full into my mind; and, what was the more mortifying, I di&s;|covered
<PB N="211" REF="032945_0208_0FF5EB1FEE39D8D8">
that the negro who was, captured with me, was at liberty, and fared as well as the &s;ailors on board the ve&s;&s;el. I had not however been confined more than one half hour, when the interpreter came to examine me privately re&s;pecting the de&s;tination of the &s;hip, to which he &s;u&s;|pected I belonged; was anxious to know if &s;he had her full cargo of &s;laves; what was her force; whether &s;he had Engli&s;h papers on board; and if &s;he did not in|tend to &s;top at &s;ome other African port. From him I learned that I was cap|tured by an Algerine Rover, Hamed Ha|li Saad captain; and &s;hould be carried into &s;lavery at Algiers. After I had lain twenty four hours in this loath&s;ome place, covered with vermin, parched with thir&s;t, and fainting with hunger, I was &s;tartled at a light, let through the hatchway, which opened &s;oftly, and a hand pre&s;ented me a cloth, dripping with cold water, in which a &s;mall quantity of boiled rice was
<PB N="212" REF="032945_0209_0FF5EAF0C9392908">
wrapped. The door clo&s;ed again &s;oftly, and I was left to enjoy my good fortune in the dark. If Abraham had indeed &s;ent Lazarus to the rich man, in torment, it appears to me, he could not have received a greater plea&s;ure, from the cool water on his tongue, than I experienced, in &s;ucking the moi&s;ture from this cloth. The next day, the &s;ame kindly hand ap|peared again, with the &s;ame refre&s;hment. I begged to &s;ee my benefactor. The door opened further, and I &s;aw a countenance in tears. It was the face of the grateful African, who was taken with me. I was oppre&s;&s;ed with gratitude. Is this, ex|claimed I, one of tho&s;e men, whom we are taught to vilify as beneath the human &s;pecies, who brings me &s;u&s;tenance, per|haps at the ri&s;k of his life, who &s;hares his mor&s;el with one of tho&s;e barbarous men, who had recently torn him from all he held dear, and who&s;e ba&s;e companions are now tran&s;porting his darling &s;on to
<PB N="213" REF="032945_0210_0FF5EB1DE4ED23E8">
a grievous &s;lavery? Grant me, I ejacu|lated, once more to ta&s;te the freedom of my native country, and every moment of my life &s;hall be dedicated to preaching again&s;t this dete&s;table commerce. I will fly to our fellow citizens in the &s;outhern &s;tates; I will, on my knees, conjure them, in the name of humanity, to aboli&s;h a trafic, which cau&s;es it to bleed in every pore. If they are deaf to the pleadings of nature, I will conjure them, for the &s;ake of con&s;i&s;tency, to cea&s;e to deprive their fellow creatures of freedom, which their writers, their orators, repre&s;entatives, &s;enators, and even their con&s;titutions of government, have declared to be the un|alienable birth right of man. My &s;able friend had no occa&s;ion to vi&s;it me a third time; for I was taken from my confine|ment, and, after being &s;tripped of the few clothes, and the little property I chanced to have about me, a log was fa&s;tened to my leg by a chain, and I was permitted
<PB N="214" REF="032945_0211_0FF5EAF2DC0C7F08">
to walk the fore ca&s;tle of the ve&s;&s;el, with the African and &s;everal Spani&s;h and Por|tugue&s;e pri&s;oners. The treatment of the &s;laves, who plied the oars, the man|agement of the ve&s;&s;el, the order which was ob&s;erved among this ferocious race, and &s;ome notices of our voyage, might af|ford ob&s;ervations, which would be highly gratifying to my readers, if the limits of this work would permit. I will ju&s;t ob|&s;erve however that the regularity and fre|quency of their devotion was a&s;toni&s;hing to me, who had been taught to con&s;ider this people as the mo&s;t bla&s;phemous infidels. In ten days after I was captured, the Ro|ver pa&s;&s;ed up the &s;traits of Gibralter, and I heard the garri&s;on evening gun fired from that formidable rock; and the next morn|ing hove in &s;ight of the city of Algiers.</P>

The Portugue&s;e pri&s;oners, to which nation the Algerines have the mo&s;t violent an|tipathy, were immediately, with every mark of contempt, &s;purned into a dark dungeon beneath the foundations of the tower, though there were &s;everal mer|chants of eminence, and one young no|bleman, in the number. The Spaniards, whom the Dey's &s;ubjects equally dete&s;t, and fear more, were confined with me in a grated room, on the &s;econd &s;tory. We received, the &s;ame evening, rations &s;im|ilar to what, we under&s;tood, were i&s;&s;ued to the garri&s;on. The next day, we were all led to a clean&s;ing hou&s;e, where we were cleared from vermin, our hair cut &s;hort, and our beards clo&s;e &s;haved; thence
<PB N="15" REF="032945_0224_0FF5EB2CA885DEF0">
taken to a bath, and, after being well bathed, we were clothed in coar&s;e linen drawers, a &s;trait wai&s;tcoat of the &s;ame without &s;leeves, and a kind of tunic or loo&s;e coat over the whole, which, with a pair of leather &s;lippers, and a blue cotton cap, equipped us, as we were informed, to appear in the pre&s;ence of the Dey, who was to &s;elect the tenth pri&s;oner from us in per&s;on. The next morning, the dragomen or interpreters, were very bu|&s;y in impre&s;&s;ing upon us the mo&s;t pro|found re&s;pect for the Dey's per&s;on and power, and teaching us the obei&s;ance nec|e&s;&s;ary to be made in our approaches to this augu&s;t potentate. Soon after, we were paraded; and Captain Hamed pre&s;ented each of us with a paper, written in a ba&s;e kind of Arabic, de&s;cribing, as I was in|formed, our per&s;ons, names, country, and conditions in life; &s;o far as our captors could collect from our &s;everal examina|tions. Upon the back of each paper was
<PB N="16" REF="032945_0225_0FF5EB5BD3616D00">
a mark or number. The &s;ame mark was painted upon a flat oval piece of wood, &s;omewhat like a painter's palette, and &s;u&s;|pended by a &s;mall bra&s;s chain to our necks, hanging upon our brea&s;ts. The guards then formed a hollow &s;quare. We were blind folded until we pa&s;&s;ed the fortifications, and then &s;uffered to view the city, and the immen&s;e rabble, which &s;urrounded us, until we came to the palace of the Dey. Here, after much military parade, the gates were thrown open, and we entered a &s;pacious court yard, at the upper end of which the Dey was &s;eated, upon a eminence, covered with the riche&s;t carpeting fringed with gold. A circular canopy of Per&s;ian &s;ilk was rai&s;ed over his head, from which were &s;u&s;pended curtains of the riche&s;t embroidery, drawn into fe&s;toons by &s;ilk cords and ta&s;&s;els, enriched with pearls. Over the eminence, upon the right and left, were canopies, which almo&s;t vied in
<PB N="17" REF="032945_0226_0FF5EB2E2C33C3F0">
riches with the former, under which &s;tood the Mufti, his numerous Hadgi's, and his principal officers, civil and military; and on each &s;ide about &s;even hundred foot guards were drawn up in the form of a half moon.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Dey, Vizier Ha&s;&s;en Ba|&s;haw, is about forty years of age, five feet ten inches in height, inclining to corpulen|cy, with a countenance rather comely than commanding; an eye which betrays &s;agacity, rather than in&s;pires awe: the latter is &s;ufficiently in&s;pired by the fierce appearance of his guards, the &s;plen|dour of his attendants, the grandeur of his court, and the magnificence of his at|tire. He was arrayed in a &s;umptuous Turki&s;h habit. His feet were &s;hod with bu&s;kins, bound upon his legs with dia|mond buttons in loops of pearl; round his wai&s;t was a broad &s;a&s;h, glittering with jew|els, to which was &s;u&s;pened a broad &s;cim|itar, the hilt of which dazzled the eye
<PB N="18" REF="032945_0227_0FF5EB5DDB50FF08">
with brilliants of the fir&s;t water, and the &s;heath of which was of the fine&s;t velvet, &s;tudded with gems and the pure&s;t gold. In his &s;carf was &s;tuck a poignard and pair of pi&s;tols of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip. The&s;e pi&s;tols and poignard were &s;aid to have been a pre&s;ent from the late unfortu|nate Louis the &s;ixteenth. The former was of pure gold, and the value of the work was &s;aid to exceed that of the pre|cious mettle two hundred times. Upon the Dey's head was a turban with the point erect, which is peculiar to the roy|al family. A large diamond cre&s;cent &s;hone con&s;picuous in the front, on the back of which a &s;ocket received the quills of two large o&s;trich feathers, which wav|ed in graceful maje&s;ty over his head. The pri&s;oners were directed by turns to approach the foot of the eminence. When within thirty paces, we were made to throw our&s;elves upon the earth and creep towards the Dey, licking the du&s;t as
<PB N="19" REF="032945_0228_0FF5EB304EA6E290">
a token of reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. As each captive approached, he was com|manded to ri&s;e, pull of his &s;lippers, and &s;tand with his face bowed to the ground, and his arms cro&s;&s;ed over his brea&s;t. The chieux or &s;ecretary then took the paper he carried and read the &s;ame. To &s;ome the Dey put que&s;tions by his drog|oman, others were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by a &s;light nod of his head. After &s;ome con&s;ulta|tion among the chief men, an officer came to where the pri&s;oners were pa|raded, and called for three by the num|ber, which was marked on their brea&s;ts. The Dey's prerogative gives him the right to &s;elect the tenth of all pri&s;oners; and, as the &s;ervice or ran&s;om of them con&s;titutes one part of his revenue, his policy is to choo&s;e tho&s;e, who&s;e friends or wealth would be mo&s;t likely to en|rich his coffers. At this time, he &s;elect|ed two wealthy Portugue&s;e merchants, and a young nobleman of the &s;ame na|tion,
<PB N="20" REF="032945_0229_0FF5EB5F60DAFAF0">
called Don Juan Combri. Im|mediately after this &s;election, we were car|ried to a &s;trong hou&s;e, or rather pri&s;on, in the city, and there guarded by an of|ficer and &s;ome of the crew of the Rover, that had taken us. The remainder of us being con&s;idered as private prop|erty, another &s;election was made by the captain and owners of the Rover; and all &s;uch, as could probably pay their ran&s;om in a &s;hort time, were removed into a place of &s;afety and &s;uffered only a clo&s;e confinement. The remnant of my companions being only eleven, con&s;i&s;ted of the Negro &s;lave, five Portugue&s;e, two Spani&s;h &s;ailors, an Italian fiddler, a Dutch|man from the Cape of Good Hope, and his Hottentot &s;ervant. As we could prof|fer no probability of ran&s;om we were re|&s;erved for another fate.</P>

<P>ON the next market day, we were &s;tripped of the dre&s;s, in which we appeared at court A napkin was wrapped round our loins, and a coar&s;e cloak thrown over our &s;houlders. We were then expo&s;ed for &s;ale in the market place, which was a &s;pacious &s;quare, inclo&s;|ed by ranges of low &s;hops, in different &s;ections of which were expo&s;ed the va|rious articles intended for &s;ale. One &s;ection was gay with flowers; another expo&s;ed all the fruits of the &s;ea&s;on. Grapes, dates, pomegranates, and orang|es
<PB N="22" REF="032945_0231_0FF5EB6163172780">
lay in tempting ba&s;kets. A third was devoted to &s;allads and pot herbs; a fourth to milk and cream. Between every &s;ection was a &s;mall room, where tho&s;e, who come to market, might occa|&s;ionally refre&s;h them&s;elves with a pipe of tobacco, a cud of opium, a gla&s;s of &s;her|bet, or other cooling liquors. Sherbet is compo&s;ed of lemons, oranges, &s;ugar, and water. It is what we, in New England, call beverage. In the centre of the mar|ket, an oblong &s;quare was railed in, where the dealers in bea&s;ts and &s;laves expo&s;ed their commodities for &s;ale. Here were camels, mules, a&s;&s;es, goats, hares, dromedaries, women and men, and all other creatures, whether for appetite or u&s;e; and I ob&s;erved that the purcha&s;ers turned from one article to the other, with equal indifference. The women &s;laves were concealed in a latticed &s;hop, but the men were expo&s;ed in open view in a &s;tall, &s;ituated between tho&s;e appropriated

to the a&s;&s;es and to the kumrah, a wretch|ed looking, though &s;erviceable animal in that country, propagated by a jack upon a cow. I now di&s;covered the rea&s;on of the alteration in our dre&s;s; for, as the people here, no more than in New En|gland, love to buy a pig in the poke, our loo&s;e coats were ea&s;ily thrown open, and the purcha&s;er had an opportunity of ex|amining into the &s;tate of our bodies. It was a&s;toni&s;hing to ob&s;erve, how critically they examined my mu&s;cles, to &s;ee if I was naturally &s;trong; moved my limbs in va|rious directions, to detect any latent lamene&s;s or injury in the parts; and &s;truck &s;uddenly before my eyes, to judge by my winking, if I was clear &s;ighted. Though I could not under&s;tand their language, I doubt not, they &s;poke of my activity, &s;trength, age, &amp;c. in the &s;ame manner, as we at home talk in the &s;wop of a hor&s;e. One old man was very crit|ical in his examination of me. He made
<PB N="24" REF="032945_0233_0FF5EB63E9491780">
me walk, run, lie down, and lift a weight of about &s;ixty pounds. He went out, and &s;oon returned with another man. They conferred together, and the &s;econd was more critical in his examination than the fir&s;t. He obliged me to run a few rods, and then laid his hand &s;uddenly to my heart, to &s;ee, as I conjecture, if my wind was good. By the old man I was pur|cha&s;ed. What the price given for me was, I cannot tell. An officer of the mar|ket atte&s;ted the contract, and I was oblig|ed by the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop, who &s;old me upon commi&s;&s;ions, for the benefit of the concerned in the Rover, to lie down in the &s;treet, take the foot of my new ma&s;|ter, and place it upon my neck; making to him, what the lawyers call, attornment. I was then &s;eized by two &s;laves, and led to the hou&s;e of my new ma&s;ter.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE higher his rank in &s;ocie|ty, the further is man removed from na|ture. Grandeur draws a circle round the great, and often excludes from them the finer feelings of the heart. The wretch|ed are all of one family; and ever regard each other as brethren. Among the &s;laves of my new ma&s;ter, I was received
<PB N="27" REF="032945_0236_0FF5EB37EA84FAB0">
with pity, and treated with tenderne&s;s, bordering upon fraternal affection. They could not indeed &s;peak my language, and I was ignorant of theirs; but, by dividing the &s;canty meal, compo&s;ing my couch of &s;traw, and alleviating my more rugged la|bours, they &s;pake that univer&s;al language of benevolence, which needs no lingui&s;t to interpret.</P>
<P>It is true, I did not meet, among my fellow &s;laves, the rich and the noble, as the dramati&s;t and the noveli&s;t had taught me to expect. To betray a weakne&s;s I will confe&s;s that, &s;ometime after I was captured, I often &s;uffered fancy to cheat me of my "weary moments," by por|traying tho&s;e &s;cenes, which had often a|mu&s;ed me in my clo&s;et, and delighted me on the &s;tage. Sometimes, I even contem|plated with plea&s;ure the company and conver&s;e of my fellow &s;laves. I expected to find them men of rank at lea&s;t, if not of learning. I fancied my ma&s;ter's cook
<PB N="28" REF="032945_0237_0FF5EB67782D83F8">
an Engli&s;h lord; his valet an Italian duke; his groom a knight of Malta; and even his foot boy &s;ome little lively French marquis. I fancied my future ma&s;ter's head gardener, taking me one &s;ide, pro|fe&s;&s;ing the warme&s;t friend&s;hip, and telling me in confidence that he was a Spani&s;h Don with forty noble names; that he had fallen in love with my ma&s;ter's fair daughter, who&s;e mother was a chri&s;tian &s;lave; that the young lady was equally charmed with him; that &s;he was to rob her father of a rich ca&s;ket of jewels, there being no di&s;honour in &s;tealing from an infidel; jump into his arms in boy's clothes that very night, and e&s;cape by a ve&s;&s;el, already provided, to his native country. I &s;aw in imagination all this accompli&s;hed. I &s;aw the lady de&s;cend the rope ladder; heard the old man and his &s;ervants pur&s;ue; &s;aw the lady carried off breathle&s;s in the arms of her knight; arrive &s;afe in Spain; was pre&s;ent at the
<PB N="29" REF="032945_0238_0FF5EB3B0C16F880">
lady's bapti&s;m into the catholic church, and at her marriage with her noble deliv|erer. I was my&s;elf almo&s;t &s;tifled with the care&s;&s;es of the noble family, for the part I had borne in this perilous adventure; and in fine married to Donna &s;ome body, the Don's beautiful &s;i&s;ter; returned into my own country, loaded with beauty and riches; and perhaps was arou&s;ed from my reverie by a poor fellow &s;lave, who&s;e ex|treme ignorance had almo&s;t blunted the &s;en&s;ibility of his own wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;o &s;weet were the delu&s;ions of my own fancy, I am loth to de&s;troy the innocent gratification, which the read|ers of novels and plays enjoy from the works of a Behn and a Colman; but the &s;ober character of the hi&s;torian compels me to a&s;&s;ure my readers that, whatever may have happened in the &s;ixteenth cen|tury, I never &s;aw during my captivity, a man of any rank, family, or fortune a|mong the menial &s;laves. The Dey, as I
<PB N="30" REF="032945_0239_0FF5EB699F7BDC38">
have already ob&s;erved, &s;electing his tenth pri&s;oner from tho&s;e, who would mo&s;t probably afford the riche&s;t ran&s;om, tho&s;e concerned in the captures are influenced by the &s;ame motive. All, who may be expected to be ran&s;omed, are deprived of this liberty, it is true; but fed, clothed, and never put to manual labour, except as a puni&s;hment for &s;ome actual crime, or attempting to recover their lib|erty. The menial &s;laves are generally compo&s;ed of the dregs of tho&s;e nations, with whom they are at war; but, though my fellow &s;laves were gro&s;sly illiterate, I mu&s;t do them the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, they had learned well the kinder virtues: tho&s;e vir|tues, which &s;chools and colleges often fail to teach, which, as Ari&s;totle well ob&s;erves, are like a flame of fire.

<P>Account of my Ma&s;ter Abdel Melic: de|&s;cription of his Hou&s;e, Wife, Country Hou&s;e, and &s;evere Treatment of his Slaves.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE name of my ma&s;ter was Abdel Melic. He had been former|ly an officer in the Dey's troops, and, it was &s;aid, had rendered the Dey's father &s;ome important &s;ervice in an in&s;urrection, and was therefore highly re&s;pected; though at that time he had no publick employ|ment. He was an au&s;tere man; his nat|ural &s;everity being probably encrea&s;ed by his employment as a military officer. I
<PB N="32" REF="032945_0241_0FF5EB6C306E7FA0">
never &s;aw the face of any other per&s;on in his family, except the male &s;laves. The hou&s;es of the Algerines are nearly all up|on the &s;ame model; con&s;i&s;ting of a building towards the &s;treet of one or two &s;tories, which is occupied by the ma&s;ter and male dome&s;|tics, and which is connected by a gallery up|on the ground, if the hou&s;e is of one &s;tory; if of two, the entrance is above &s;tairs, to a building of nearly the &s;ame &s;ize behind, which has no windows or lattices at the &s;ide, but only looking into a garden, which is always &s;urrounded by a high wall. In the&s;e back apartments <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> women are lodged, both wives and &s;laves. My ma&s;|ter had a wife, the daughter of a princi|pal officer in the Dey's court, and, to my &s;urpri&s;e, had only one. I found it to be a vulgar errour, that the Algerines had gen|erally more. It is true they are allowed four by their law; but they generally find, as in our country, one lady &s;ufficient for all the comforts of connubial life; and
<PB N="33" REF="032945_0242_0FF5EB3E95CE88E8">
never take another, except family alliance or barrenne&s;s renders it eligible or nec|e&s;&s;ary. The more I became acquainted with their cu&s;toms, the more was I &s;truck with their great re&s;emblance to the pa|triarchical manners, de&s;cribed in holy writ. Concubinage is allowed; but few re&s;pectable people practi&s;e it, except for the &s;ake of heirs. With the Algerines the barrenne&s;s of a RACHEL is &s;ometimes compen&s;ated to the hu&s;band, by the fertil|ity of a BILHAH. After I had lived in this town hou&s;e about three weeks, dur|ing which time I was clothed after the fa&s;hion of the country, my ma&s;ter moved, with his whole family, to a country hou&s;e on the river Saffran. Our journey, which was about twelve miles, was per|formed in the evening. Two carriages, re&s;embling our travelling waggons, con|tained the women. Only the bodies of them were latticed, and furni&s;hed with cur|tains to cover them in the day time, which
<PB N="34" REF="032945_0243_0FF5EB6E349165C0">
were rolled up in the evening. Two &s;laves preceded the carriages. Abdel Melic followed on hor&s;eback, and I ac|companied a baggage waggon in the rear. When we arrived at the country hou&s;e, the garden gates were thrown open, and the carriages with the women entered. The men were introduced to the front apartments. I found here &s;everal more &s;laves, equally ignorant and equally attentive and kind towards me, as tho&s;e I had &s;een in the town. The next day, we were all &s;et to work in digging for the foundation of a new wall, which was to enlarge our ma&s;ter's gardens. The weath|er was &s;ultry. The &s;oil below the &s;urface was almo&s;t a quick&s;and. I, un|u&s;ed to hard labour, found my &s;trength &s;oon exhau&s;ted. My fellow &s;laves, com|pa&s;&s;ionating my di&s;tre&s;s, were anxious, by changing places with me, to render my &s;hare of the labour le&s;s toil&s;ome. As we had our &s;tint for the whole party &s;taked
<PB N="35" REF="032945_0244_0FF5EB40A3480350">
out to us every morning, it was in the power of my kind fellow labourers to fa|vour me much. Often would they re|que&s;t me, by &s;igns, to repo&s;e my&s;elf in the &s;hade, while they encouraged each other to perform my &s;hare of the ta&s;k. After a while, our ma&s;ter came to in&s;pect the work; and, conceiving that it did not progre&s;s as fa&s;t as he wi&s;hed, he put an over&s;eer over us, who, finding me not &s;o active as the re&s;t, fir&s;t threatened and then &s;truck me with his whip. This was the fir&s;t di&s;graceful blow I had ever received. Judge you, my gallant, freeborn fellow citizens, you, who rejoice daily in our federal &s;trength and independence, what were my &s;en&s;ations. I threw down my &s;pade with di&s;dain, and retired from my work, lowering indignation upon my in|&s;ulting oppre&s;&s;or. Upon his lifting his whip to &s;trike me again, I flew at him, collared him, and threw him on his back. Then, &s;etting my foot on his brea&s;t, I
<PB N="36" REF="032945_0245_0FF5EB6FB923C6F0">
called upon my fellow &s;laves to a&s;&s;i&s;t me to bind the wretch, and to make one glo|rious effort for our freedom. But I called in vain. They could not com|prehend my language; and, if they could, I &s;poke to &s;laves, a&s;toni&s;hed at my pre|&s;umption, and dreading the con&s;equences for me and them&s;elves. After their fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, they ran and took me gent|ly off from the over&s;eer, and rai&s;ed him with the greate&s;t re&s;pect. No &s;ooner was he upon his feet than, mad with rage, he took up a mattoc; and, with a violent blow upon my head, levelled me to the ground. I lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and was awak|ened from my &s;tupor by the &s;evere la&s;hes of his whip, with which the da&s;tardly wretch continued to beat me, until his &s;trength failed. I was then left to the care of my fellow &s;laves, who could only wa&s;h my wounds with their tears. Com|plaint was immediately made to my ma&s;|ter, and I was &s;ent to work in a &s;tone

I was &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t mi&s;erable objects. My fellow labourers had been put to this place, as a puni&s;hment for do|me&s;tic crimes, or for their &s;uperiour &s;trength, and all were obliged to labour equally hard. To break hard rocks with heavy mauls, to tran&s;port large &s;tones upon our backs up the craggy &s;ides of the quarry, were our common labours; and to drink water, which would have been delicious, if cold, and to eat black barley bread and onions, our daily fare; while the few hours, allotted to re&s;t upon our flinty beds, were di&s;turbed by the tormenting in&s;ects, or on my part by the more tor|menting dreams of the dainties of my fa|ther's hou&s;e. There is a &s;pring under a rock upon my father's farm, which we called the cold &s;pring, from which we u&s;|ed

Being pre&s;ented with a tumbler filled from this &s;pring, af|ter my return, in a large, circle of friends, the agonies I had &s;uffered came &s;o forci|bly into my recollection, that I could not drink the water, but had the weakne&s;s to melt into tears.</P>

He arre&s;ted my atten|tion. For a moment I &s;u&s;pended my la|bour. At the &s;ame moment, an unmer|ciful la&s;h, from the whip of the &s;lave driv|er, recalled my attention to my work, and excited his, who was the cau&s;e of my neg|lect. At his approach, the &s;lave driver quitted me. The &s;tranger acco&s;ted me, and in good Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;erated my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which, he &s;aid, he &s;hould de|plore the more, if they were remedile&s;s.

For three years after my captivity, like you, I groaned under the la&s;h of the &s;lave driv|er; I ate the &s;canty mor&s;el of bitterne&s;s, moi&s;tened with my tears. Borne down by the complicated ills of hunger and &s;evere labour, I was carried to the infir|mary for &s;laves, to breathe my la&s;t, where I was vi&s;ited by a Mollah or Mahometan prie&s;t. He pitied the misfortunes of a wretch, who, he &s;aid, had &s;uffered a cruel exi&s;tence, in this life, and had no rational hopes of exchanging it for a better, in the world to come.

I &s;orrow for your di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and pity your preju|dices. I pity you too, replied I, the tears &s;tanding in my eyes. My body is in &s;lave|ry, but my mind is free.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next day, an order came from the Mufti to my ma&s;ter, who receiv|ed the order, touched his forehead with the tefta re&s;pectfully, and directed me to be in&s;tantly delivered to the Mollah. I was carried to the college, a large gloomy building, on the out&s;ide; but, within the walls, it was an earthly paradi&s;e. The
<PB N="47" REF="032945_0256_0FF5EB4D8AC337F0">
&s;tately rooms, refre&s;hing baths, cooling fountains, luxuriant gardens, ample lar|ders, rich carpets, downy &s;ofas, and &s;ilken mattre&s;&s;es, offered with profu&s;ion all tho&s;e &s;oft excitements to indolent plea&s;ure, which the mo&s;t refined voluptu|ary could de&s;ire. I have often ob|&s;erved that, in all countries, except New England, tho&s;e, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it is to decry the luxuries and vanities of this world, &s;ome how or other, con|trive to po&s;&s;e&s;s the greate&s;t portion of them.</P>
<P>Immediately upon my entering the&s;e &s;a|cred walls, I was carried to a warm bath, into which I was immediately plunged; while my attendants, as if emulous to clean&s;e me from all the filth of errour, rub|bed me &s;o hard with their hands and fle&s;h bru&s;hes, that I verily thought they would have flayed me. While I was relaxed with the tepid, I was &s;uddenly plunged into a contiguous cold bath. I confe&s;s I
<PB N="48" REF="032945_0257_0FF5EB7C941B9D10">
apprehended dangerous con&s;equences, from &s;o &s;udden a check of &s;uch violent per&s;piration; but I aro&s;e from the cold bath highly invigorated. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Indian of North America &s;urpri&s;ed the European phy&s;ician, by a proce&s;s founded on &s;im|ilar principles. The patient, in the mo&s;t violent fever, was confined in a low hut, built of turf and flat &s;tones, which had been previou&s;ly heated by fire. When the profu&s;e&s;t per&s;piration was thus excited, the patient was carried, and often, with Indian fortitude, ran to the next &s;tream, and plunged frequently through the ice into the cold|e&s;t water. This proce&s;s, which Boerhaave and Sydenham would have pronounced deletery, ever produced pri&s;tine health and vigour, when pre&s;cribed by the Indian phy&s;ician or Pow|wow.</NOTE> I was then an|ointed in all parts, which had been ex|po&s;ed to the &s;un with a preparation of a gum, called the balm of Mecca. This ap|plication excited a very unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, &s;imilar to the &s;troke of the water pepper,
<PB N="49" REF="032945_0258_0FF5EB4F0E88DEF8">
to which "the liberal &s;hepherds give a gro&s;&s;er name." In twenty four hours, the &s;un browned cuticle peeled off, and left my face, hands, legs, and neck as fair as a child's of &s;ix months old. This balm the Algerine ladies procure at a great expen&s;e, and u&s;e it as a co&s;metic to heighten their beau|ty.</P>
<P>After I had been clothed in the drawers, &s;lippers, loo&s;e coat, and &s;hirt of the country, if &s;hirt it could be called, which neck had none; with a decoction of the herb hen|na, my hands and feet were tinged yel|low: which colour, they &s;aid, denoted purity of intention. I was lodged and fed well, and &s;uffered to amu&s;e my&s;elf, and recover my &s;anity of body and mind. On the eleventh day, as I was reclining on the margin of a retired fountain, re|flecting on my dear native country, I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> joined by the Mollah.

He was born at Antioch, and educated a chri&s;tian of the Greek church. He was de&s;igned by his parents for a pre|ferment in that church, when he was cap|tured by the Algerines, and almo&s;t imme|diately, conformed to the mu&s;&s;ulman faith; and was in high e&s;teem in the &s;a|cred college of the prie&s;ts. As he &s;poke latin and &s;ome modern languages fluent|ly, was well ver&s;ed in the bible and chri&s;|tian doctrines, he was often employed in pro&s;elyting the European &s;laves, and prided him&s;elf in his frequent &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>He acco&s;ted me with the &s;weete&s;t mod|ulation of voice; kindly inquired after my welfare; begged to know if my lodg|ing, dre&s;s, and fare, were agreeable; a&s;|&s;uring me that, if I wi&s;hed to alter either, in &s;uch a manner as to bring them nearer to the fare and modes of my native country, and would give my directions, they &s;hould be obeyed. He reque&s;ted me to appoint

a time, when we might conver&s;e upon the great &s;ubject of religion. He ob&s;erved that he wi&s;hed me free from bodily indi&s;|po&s;ition, and that the powers of my mind would recover their activity. He &s;aid, the holy faith, he offered to my embraces, di&s;dained the u&s;e of other powers than ra|tional argument; that he left to the church of Rome, and its mercile&s;s inqui&s;itors, all the honour and profit of conver&s;ion by faggots, dungeons, and racks. He made &s;ome further inquiry, as to my u&s;age in the college, and retired. I had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to the in&s;olence of do|me&s;tic tyranny; &s;o often groaned under the whip and burthen; &s;o often been buffetted, &s;purned and &s;pit upon, that I had &s;teeled my mind again&s;t the &s;orce and terrour, I anticipated from the Mollah; but was totally unprepared for &s;uch ap|parent candour and gentlene&s;s.

<P>So is ours; which is the more remarkable, as our great prophet de|clared, he was not &s;ent into the world to work miracles, but to preach the unity of the fir&s;t cau&s;e, the re&s;urrection of the dead, the bli&s;s of paradi&s;e, and the tor|ments of the damned. Yet his whole life was a miracle. He was no &s;ooner born than, with a voice, like the thundering of Heronon, he pronounced the adorable creed to his mother and nur&s;es: <HI>I profe&s;s
<PB N="59" REF="032945_0268_0FF5EBB96E7F55E8">
that there is only one God, and that I am his apo&s;tle.</HI> He was circumci&s;ed from all eternity; and, at the &s;ame hour, a voice of four mighty angels was heard proclaiming from the four corners of the holy hou&s;e. The fir&s;t &s;aying, proclaim the truth is ri&s;en, and all lies &s;hall return into hell. The &s;econd uttering, now is born an apo&s;tle of your own nation, and the Omnipotent is with him. The words of the third were, a book full of illu&s;trious light is &s;ent to you from God; and the fourth voice was heard to &s;ay, O Maho|met, we have &s;ent thee to be a prophet, apo&s;tle, and guide to the world.</P>
<P>When the &s;ent of God was about three years old, the ble&s;&s;ed child retired into a cave, at the ba&s;is of mount Uriel; when the archangel Gabriel, covering his face with his wings, in awful re&s;pect approach|ed him &s;aying, Bi&s;millahi Rrahmani Rrha|himi; in the name of the one Almighty, Compa&s;&s;ionate, and Merciful, I am &s;ent to

<P>My friend, you &s;urely have not read the writings of your own hi&s;to|rians. The hi&s;tory of the chri&s;tian church is a detail of bloody ma&s;&s;acre: from the in&s;titution of the chri&s;tian thundering le|gion, under Con&s;tantine the great, to the expul&s;ion of the Moors out of Spain by the ferocious inqui&s;ition, or the dragoon|ing of the Hugonots from France, under Louis the great. The mu&s;&s;ulmen never yet forced a man to adopt their faith. When Abubeker, the caliph, took a chri&s;|tian city, he forbore to enter a principal church, as he &s;hould pray in the temple of God; and, where he prayed, the build|ing would be e&s;tabli&s;hed as a mo&s;que by

the piety of the faithful. The compan|ions and &s;ucce&s;&s;ours of the apo&s;tle conquer|ed cities and kingdoms, like other nations. They gave civil laws to the conquered, according to the laws of nations; but they never forced the con&s;cience of any man. It is true, they then and we now, when a &s;lave pronounces the infallible creed, immediately knock off his fet|ters and receive him as a brother; be|cau&s;e we read in the book of Zuni that the &s;ouls of true believers are bound up in one fragrant bundle of eternal love. We leave it to the chri&s;tians of the We&s;t In|dies, and chri&s;tians of your &s;outhern plan|tations, to baptize the unfortunate Af|rican into your faith, and then u&s;e your brother chri&s;tians as brutes of the de&s;|ert.</P>

<P>So the doctors of your church tell you; but a &s;en&s;ual heaven is no more imputable to us than to you.

The enjoyment of the Houri, tho&s;e immortal virgins, who will attend the beatified believer; the &s;plendid pa|vilions of the heavens, are all but types and &s;ignifications of holy joys too &s;ub|lime for man in fle&s;h to conceive of. In your bible, I read, your prophet refers to the time, when he &s;hould drink new wine in his father's kingdom.

<P>THE very day, I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the college of the prie&s;ts, I was re|turned to my ma&s;ter, and the next morn|ing &s;ent again to labour in the quarry. To my &s;urpri&s;e, no har&s;h reflections were made upon, what the&s;e true believers mu&s;t have &s;tiled, my ob&s;tinate prejudice again&s;t the true faith; for I am &s;en&s;ible that my ma&s;ter was &s;o good a mu&s;&s;ulman as to have rejoiced in my conver&s;ion, though it might affect his pur&s;e. I experienced
<PB N="67" REF="032945_0276_0FF5EBC194888BC8">
the extreme&s;t contumely and &s;everity; but I was never branded as a heretic. I had by this time acquired &s;ome knowl|edge of their language, if language it could be called, which bad defiance to modes and ten&s;es, appearing to be the &s;hreds and clippings of all the tongues, dead and living, ever &s;poken &s;ince the creation. It is well known on the &s;ea coa&s;ts of the Mediterranean by the name of LINGUA FRANCA. Probably it had its ri&s;e in the awkward endeavours of the natives to conver&s;e with &s;trangers from all parts of the world, and the vulgar people, calling all foreigners <HI>Franks,</HI> &s;upplied its <HI>name.</HI> I the more readily acquired this jargon, as it contained many Latin derivatives. If I have conjectured the principle, upon which the <HI>Lingua Franca</HI> was originally formed, it is applied through all &s;tages of its exi&s;tence: every per&s;on having good right to introduce words and phra&s;es from his vernacular tongue, and which, with
<PB N="68" REF="032945_0277_0FF5EB909382C040">
&s;ome alteration in accent, are readily a|dopted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I well recollect, being once at a lo&s;s to name a compo&s;ition of boiled barley, rice and treacle, I called for the HASTY PUDDING and MOLASSES. The phra&s;e was immediately adopted, and HASCHI PUDAH MOLASCHI is now a &s;ynonima with the ancient name: and, I doubt not, if a dictionary of the Lingua Franca &s;hall ever be compiled, the name of the &s;taple cookery of New England will have a con&s;picuous place.</NOTE></P>
<P>This medley of &s;ounds is generally &s;poken, but the people of the higher rank pride them&s;elves in &s;peaking pure Arabic. My conference with the Mol|lah was effected in Latin, which the prie&s;t pronounced very differently from the learned pre&s;ident and profe&s;&s;ors of Har|vard college, but delivered him&s;elf with fluency and elegance.</P>

quitted it; and the labours and hard fare &s;eemed, if po&s;&s;ible, to be augmented. The ea&s;e and comfort, with which I lived for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t, had vitiated my appetite, &s;oftened my hands, and relaxed my whole frame, &s;o that my coar&s;e fare and rugged labours &s;eemed more in&s;upportable. I nau&s;eated our homely food, and the &s;kin peeled from my hands and &s;houlders. I made what inquiries I could, as to the interiour geography of the country, and comforted my&s;elf with theh ope of e&s;cape; conceiving it, under my de&s;perate circum|&s;tances, po&s;&s;ible to penetrate unob&s;erved the interiour country, by the ea&s;tern boundaries of the kingdom of Morocco, and then pa&s;s on &s;outh we&s;t, until I &s;truck the river Sanaga, and cour&s;ing that to its mouth I knew would bring me to &s;ome of the European &s;ettlements near Goree or Cape Verd. Preparatory to my intend|ed e&s;cape I had procured an old goat's &s;kin, which to make into &s;omething like a
<PB N="71" REF="032945_0280_0FF5EBC65E53EE68">
knap&s;ack, I deprived my&s;elf of many hours of nece&s;&s;ary &s;leep; and of many a &s;canty meal to fill it with provi&s;ions. By the u&s;e of my Lingua Franca and a lit|tle Arabic, I hoped to obtain the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the &s;laves and lower orders of the people, through whom I might journey. The only in&s;urmountable difficulty in my projects was to elude the vigilance of our over&s;eers. By a kind of roll call the &s;laves were numbered every night and morning, and at meal times: but, very fortunate|ly, a probable opportunity of e&s;caping unnoticed &s;oon offered. It was announced to the &s;laves that in three days time there would be a day of re&s;t, a holiday, when they would be allowed to recreate them|&s;elves in the fields. This intelligence diffu&s;ed general joy. I received it with rapture. I doubled my diligence in my preparations; and, in the afternoon pre|vious to this fortunate day, I contrived to place my little &s;tock of provi&s;ions under
<PB N="72" REF="032945_0281_0FF5EB951F25C528">
a rock at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the quarry. At &s;un&s;et we were all admitted to bathe, and I retired to my repo&s;e with bright hopes of freedom in my heart, which were &s;uc|ceeded by the mo&s;t plea&s;ing dreams of my native land. That Beneficent Being, who brightens the &s;lumbers of the wretched with rays of bli&s;s, can alone expre&s;s my raptures, when, in the vi&s;ions of that night, I &s;tepped lightly over a father's thre&s;h|hold; was &s;urrounded by congratulating friends and faithful dome&s;tics; was pre&s;&s;|ed by the embraces of a father; and with holy joy felt a mother's tears moi&s;ten my cheek.</P>
<P>Early in the dawn of the morning, I was awakened by the congratulations of my fellows, who immediately collected in &s;mall groups, planning out the intended amu&s;ements of the day. Scarce had they portioned the little &s;pace alloted to ea&s;e, according their various inclinations, when an expre&s;s order came from our

ma&s;ter that we &s;hould go under the im|mediate direction of our over&s;eers, to a plain, about five miles di&s;tance, to be pre&s;ent at a publick &s;pectacle. This was a grievous di&s;appointment to them, and more e&s;pecially to me. I buoyed up my &s;pirits however with the hopes that, in the hurry and crowd, I might find means to e&s;cape, which, although I knew I could not return for my knap&s;ack, I was re&s;olved to attempt, having a little millet and two onions in my pocket.</P>

<P>WE were &s;oon paraded and marched to the plain, to be amu&s;ed with the promi&s;ed &s;pectacle, which, notwith|&s;tanding it might probably fru&s;trate my attempts for freedom, I anticipated with a plea&s;ing curio&s;ity. When we arrived at the plain, we found, &s;urrounding a &s;pot, fenced in with a &s;light railing, a large concour&s;e of people, among whom I could di&s;cern many groups of men, who&s;e hab|its and &s;orrow indented faces &s;hewed them to be of the &s;ame mi&s;erable order with us. In the mid&s;t of this &s;pot there was a frame

erected, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the &s;tage of our pillories; on the centre of which a pole or &s;trong &s;take was erected, &s;harpened at the end and pointed with &s;teel.

The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I had been, one mo|ment before, meditating the &s;ame act, for which this wretch was to &s;uffer &s;o cruel|ly, added to my feelings for a fellow crea|ture, excited &s;o &s;trong a &s;ympathy for the devoted wretch, that I was near faint|ing.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HERE I was lodged comforta|bly, and had all the attention paid me, which good nur&s;es and ignorant phy&s;i|cians could render. The former were men, who had made a vow of poverty, and who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion was to attend the couches of the &s;ick; the latter were more ignorant than tho&s;e of my own country, who had amu&s;ed me in the gayer days of life. They had no theory nor any &s;y&s;tem|atic practice; but it was immaterial to me. I had ca&s;t my la&s;t anxious thoughts upon
<PB N="82" REF="032945_0291_0FF5EB9F6A1FB4E8">
my dear native land, had ble&s;&s;ed my af|fectionate parents, and was re&s;igned to die.</P>
<P>One day as I was &s;unk upon my bed, after a violent fit of coughing, I was a|wakened from a doze, by a familiar voice, which acco&s;ted me in Latin. I opened my eyes and &s;aw at my &s;ide, the Mol|lah, who attempted to de&s;troy my faith. It immediately &s;truck me that his purpo&s;e was to tempt me to apo&s;tatize in my la&s;t moments. The religion of my country was all I had left of the many ble&s;&s;ings, I once enjoyed, in common with my fellow citizens. This rendered it doubly dear to me. Not that I was in&s;en&s;ible of the excellence and verity of my faith; no. If I had been expo&s;ed to &s;everer agonies than I &s;uffered, and had been flattered with all the riches and honours, the&s;e infidels could be&s;tow, I tru&s;t I &s;hould never have foregone that faith, which a&s;&s;ured me for the mi&s;e|ries, I &s;u&s;tained in a cruel &s;eparation from
<PB N="83" REF="032945_0292_0FF5EBD2675FD198">
my parents, friends, and intolerable &s;lave|ry, a rich compen&s;ation in that future world, where I &s;hould rejoin my beloved friends, and where &s;orrow, mi&s;ery, or &s;lavery, &s;hould never come. I judged uncandidly of the prie&s;t. He acco&s;ted me with the &s;ame gentlene&s;s, as when at the college, commi&s;erated my deplorable &s;ituation, and, upon my expre&s;&s;ing an a|ver&s;ion to talk upon religion, he a&s;&s;ured me that he di&s;dained taking any advan|tage of my weakne&s;s; nor would attempt to deprive me of the con&s;olation of my faith, when he feared I had no time left to ground me in a better. He recom|mended me to the particular care of the religious, who attended the &s;ick in the ho&s;|pital; and, having learned in our former conferences that I was educated a phy|&s;ician, he influenced his friend the direc|tor of the infirmary to purcha&s;e me, if I regained my health, and told him I would be &s;erviceable, as a minor a&s;&s;i&s;tant. If
<PB N="84" REF="032945_0293_0FF5EBA0EF8D9968">
any man could have effected a change of my religion, it was this prie&s;t. I was charmed with the man, though I abom|inated his faith. His very &s;mile exhiler|ated my &s;pirits and infu&s;ed health; and, when he repeated his vi&s;its, and communi|cated his plan of alleviating my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the very idea, of being freed from the op|pre&s;&s;ions of Abdel Melic, made an ex|change of &s;lavery appear de&s;irable. I was again attached to life, and reque&s;ted him to procure a &s;mall quantity of the quinquina or je&s;uits bark.

<P>MY circum&s;tances were now &s;o greatly ameliorated that, if I could have been a&s;&s;ured of returning to my native country in a few years, I &s;hould have e&s;|teemed them eligible.

After a marked and a&s;&s;iduous atten|tion of &s;ome months to the duties of my office, I acquired the confidence of my &s;uperiours &s;o far, that I was &s;ometimes &s;ent abroad in the city to examine a pa|tient, who had applied for admi&s;&s;ion into the infirmary; and &s;ometimes the phy&s;i|cians them&s;elves would conde&s;cend to con&s;ult me.

<P>Vi&s;its a &s;ick Lady.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY reputation increa&s;ed, and I was called the learned &s;lave; and, &s;oon after, &s;ent for to vi&s;it a &s;ick lady. This was very agreeable to me; for, during my whole captivity, I had never yet &s;een the face of a woman; even the female chil|dren being carefully concealed, at lea&s;t
<PB N="92" REF="032945_0301_0FF5EBA90E3B4B98">
from the &s;ight of the vulgar. I now an|ticipated much &s;ati&s;faction from this vi&s;it, and hoped that, through the confi|dence, with which a tender and &s;ucce&s;s|ful phy&s;ician &s;eldom fails to in&s;pire his patient, I &s;hould be able to acquire much u&s;eful information upon &s;ubjects of do|me&s;tic concern, impervious to travellers. Preparatory to this vi&s;it, I had received a new and better &s;uit of clothes than I had worn, as a pre&s;ent from the father of the young lady. A gilt waggon came to the gate of the ho&s;pital, which I entered with our principal phy&s;ician, and was drawn by mules to a country hou&s;e, a|bout five miles from the city, where I was received by Hadgi Mulladin, the fa|ther of my patient, with great civility. Real gentlemen are the &s;ame in all coun|tries. He treated us with fruit and &s;her|bet; and, &s;miling upon me, after he had pre&s;ented a bowl of &s;herbet to the princi|pal phy&s;ician, he handed me another
<PB N="93" REF="032945_0302_0FF5EBDAAF949678">
bowl, which to my &s;urpri&s;e I found fill|ed with an excellent Greek wine, and archly inquired of me how I liked the <HI>&s;herbet.</HI> Hadgi Mulladin had travel|led in his youth, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to have imbibed the libertine principles of the chri&s;tian, as it re&s;pected wine. This was the only in&s;tance, which came to my knowledge, of any profe&s;&s;ed Mu&s;&s;ulman indulging him&s;elf with wine or any &s;trong liquor; and it was not unnoticed by the principal phy&s;ician, who afterwards grave|ly told me that Hadgi Mulladin would be undoubtedly damned for drinking wine; would be condemned to perpetual thir&s;t in the next world, while the black &s;pirit would pre&s;ent him with red hot cups of &s;calding wine. Exhilirated by the wine and the comparitively free manners of this Algerine, I was anxious to &s;ee my patient. I was &s;oon gratified. Being in|troduced into a large room, I was left a|lone nigh an hour. A &s;ide door was
<PB N="94" REF="032945_0303_0FF5EBAB1DB97B58">
then opened, and two eunuchs came for|ward with much &s;olemnity and made &s;igns for me to retire to the farthe&s;t part of the room, as if I had been infe&s;ted with &s;ome malignant di&s;order. They were, in about ten minutes, followed by four more of the &s;ame &s;ex, bearing a &s;pecies of couch, clo&s;e covered with double curtains of &s;ilk, which they &s;et down in the mid&s;t of the room; and every one drew a broad &s;cimitar from his belt, flouri&s;hing it in the air, inclined it over his &s;houlder, and &s;tood guard at every corner of the couch, While I was wondering at this parade, the two fir&s;t eunuchs retired and &s;oon re|turned; the one bearing an ewer or ba&s;on of water, the other a low marble &s;tand, and &s;ome napkins in a China di&s;h. I was then directed to wa&s;h my feet; and, an|other ba&s;on being produced, it was &s;igni|fied that I mu&s;t wa&s;h my hands, which I did three times. A large thick mu&s;lin veil was then thrown over my head, I was
<PB N="95" REF="032945_0304_0FF5EBDD036EF7A0">
led towards the couch, and was pre|&s;ented with a pul&s;e gla&s;s, being a long gla&s;s tube graduated and terminated be|low with a hollow bulb, and filled with &s;ome liquid, which ro&s;e and fell like &s;pir|its in the thermometer. This in&s;trument was in&s;erted through the curtains, and the bulb applied to the pul&s;e of my patient, and the other extremity put un|der my veil. By this I was to form my opinion of her di&s;order, and pre&s;cribe a remedy; for I was not allowed to a&s;k any que&s;tions or even to &s;peak to, much more &s;ee the lady, who was &s;oon reconveyed to her apartment. The two fir&s;t eunuchs now marched in the rear, and clo&s;ed and fa&s;tened the doors carefully after them. After waiting alone two hours or more, I was called to give my advice; and never was I more puzzled. To confe&s;s igno|rance would have ruined my reputation, and reputation was then life it&s;elf. The temptations to quackery were powerful
<PB N="96" REF="032945_0305_0FF5EBAD9F73A2C0">
and overcame me. I boldly pronounced her di&s;ea&s;e to be an intermittent fever, pre&s;cribed vene&s;ection, and exhibited &s;ome common febrifuge, with directions to throw in the bark, when the fever cea&s;ed. My pre&s;criptions were attended with ad|mirable &s;ucce&s;s; and, if I had conformed to their faith, beyond a doubt, I might have acquired immen&s;e riches. But I was a &s;lave, and all my gains were the property of my ma&s;ter. I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay that, he permitted me to keep any particular pre&s;ents, that were made to me. Frequent applications were made to the director for my advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the di&s;ea&s;ed; and, though he received generally my fee, yet it was &s;ufficiently gratifiying to me to be permit|ted to walk abroad, to amu&s;e my&s;elf, and obtain information of this extraordinary people, as much of which, as the pre&s;crib|ed limits of this little work will admit, I &s;hall now lay before my readers.</P>

<P>MUCH antiquarian lore might here be di&s;played, in determining wheth|er the &s;tate of Algiers was part of the ancient Mauritinia Ma&s;&s;ilia, or within the boundaries of the republic of Car|thage; and pages of fruitle&s;s re&s;earch might be wa&s;ted, in preci&s;ely a&s;certaining the era, when that portion of the &s;ea coa&s;t of Af|rica,

now generally known by the name of the Barbary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bruce, an Engli&s;hman, who travelled to col|lect fairy tales for the amu&s;ement of London cits, ob&s;erves that this territory was called <HI>Barbaria</HI> by the Greeks and Romans from <HI>Beber,</HI> &s;ignifying a &s;hepherd; and even the accurate compiler of the American edition of Guthrie's Geography has quoted the ob&s;ervation in a marginal note. We can|not expect that geographers &s;hould be philologi&s;ts any more than that every printer &s;hould be a Web&s;ter. How the Greeks or Romans came by the word <HI>Beber,</HI> I leave Mr. Bruce to elucidate. The form|er had the term <HI>barbaros,</HI> a barbarian, which they indi&s;criminately applied to all foreigners; and, when Greek literature became fa&s;hionable in Ro|man &s;chools, the latter adopted the term, and <HI>bar|barus</HI> was applied by the Romans with the &s;ame &s;oppi&s;h contempt.</NOTE> Shore, was &s;ubdued by the Romans, or conquered by the Vandals.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of nations like the biogra|phy of man, only a&s;&s;umes an intere&s;ting importance, when its &s;ubject is matured into vigour. To trace the infancy of the

Suffice it then to &s;ay, that the mixed multitudes, which inhabited this country, were reduced to the &s;ubjection of the Greek emperours by the arms of the celebrated Beli&s;arius, and &s;o continued, until the clo&s;e of the &s;eventh century, when they were &s;ubdued by the invinci|ble power, and converted to the creed of the ancient caliphs, the immediate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ours of the prophet Mahomet, who parcelled the country into many &s;ubordi|nate governments, among which was that of Algiers; which is now bounded, on the north, by the Mediterranean; on the &s;outh, by mount Atlas, &s;o familiar to the cla&s;&s;ic reader, and the chain of hills, which extends thence to the north ea&s;t; on the we&s;t, by the kingdom of Morocco; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The common geography compilers add the kingdom of T<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">filet, I conjecture, upon the au|thority of Dr. Shaw, though I could never hear of any &s;uch kingdom in Africa.

on the ea&s;t, by the &s;tate of Tunis. The &s;tate of Algiers is about five hundred miles in length, upon the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean, and from fifty to one hundred and twenty miles in breadth, and boa&s;ts about as large an extent of territo|ry, as is contained in all the United States proper, which lay to the north of Penn|&s;ylvania including the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It was nine hundred years after the conque&s;t of the caliphs, and at the begin|ning of the tenth century, that the Alge|rines, by becoming formidable to the Eu|ropeans, acquired the notice of the enlight|ened hi&s;torian. About this time, two enterprizing young men, &s;ons of a potter, of the i&s;land of Mytelene the ancient Le&s;bos,
<PB N="101" REF="032945_0310_0FF5EC0CB540EF40">
called Horrie and Hayraddin, collect|ing a number of de&s;peradoes, &s;eized upon a brigantine and commenced pirates, making indi&s;criminate depredations upon the ve&s;&s;els of all nations. They &s;oon augmented their force to a fleet of twelve gallies, be&s;ide &s;mall craft, with which they infe&s;ted the &s;ea coa&s;t of Spain and Italy, and carried their booty into the ports of Barbary, &s;tyling them&s;elves the lords of the &s;ea, and the enemies of all tho&s;e, who &s;ailed upon it. European nations were not then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hed and formidable navies, as at the pre&s;ent day: even the Engli&s;h, who &s;eem formed for the command of the &s;ea, had but few &s;hips of force. Henry the eighth built &s;ome ve&s;|&s;els, which, from their unmanageable bulk, were rather &s;uited for home defence than foreign enterprize; and the fleet of Elizabeth, which, in fifteen hundred and eighty eight, de&s;troyed the Spani&s;h. Ar|mada, was principally formed of &s;hips,
<PB N="102" REF="032945_0311_0FF5EC17A85729E8">
chartered by the merchants, who were the general re&s;ource of all the maratime pow|ers. The fleet of the&s;e adventurers was therefore formidable; and, as Robert&s;on &s;ays, &s;oon became terrible from the &s;traits of the Dardanelles to tho&s;e of Gibralter. The pro&s;pects of ambition increa&s;e, as man a&s;cends its &s;ummit. Horrie, the elder brother, &s;urnamed Barbaro&s;&s;a, as &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, from the red colour of his beard, a&s;pired to the attainment of &s;ove|reign power upon land; and a favourable opportunity &s;oon offered of gratifying his pride. His frequent intercour&s;e with the Barbary States induced an acquaintance with Eutimi, then king of Algiers, who was then at war with Spain, and had made &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful attacks upon a &s;mall fort, built by that nation on the Oran. In his di&s;tre&s;s, this king incon&s;iderately ap|plied to Barbaro&s;&s;a, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who readily embraced the invitation, and con|ducted him&s;elf like more modern allies.
<PB N="103" REF="032945_0312_0FF5C41BB650F3F8">
He fir&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted this weak king again&s;t his enemy, and then &s;acrificed him to his own ambition; for, leaving his brother Hay|raddin to command the fleet, he entered the city of Algiers, at the head of five thou&s;and men, was received by the inhab|itants, as their deliverer, a&s;&s;i&s;ted them a|gain&s;t the Spaniards, and then arre&s;ted and di&s;armed the principal people, &s;ecret|ly murdered the un&s;u&s;pecting Eutimi, and cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be proclaimed king of Algiers. Lavi&s;h of his trea&s;ures to his adherents, and cruelly vindictive to tho&s;e, he di&s;tru&s;ted, he not only e&s;tabli&s;h|ed his government, but dethroned the neighbouring king of Temecien, and an|nexed his dominions to his own. But the brave Marquis de Come&s;es, the Span|i&s;h governour of Oran, by the direction of the Emperour Charles the fifth, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the dethroned king; and, after defeating Barbaro&s;&s;a in &s;everal bloody battles, be|&s;ieged him in Temecien, the capital of

that kingdom, where this ferocious ad|venturer was &s;lain in attempting his e&s;|cape, but &s;ought his pur&s;uers with a bru|tal rage, becoming the ferocity of his life. Upon the death of Barbaro&s;&s;a, his broth|er Hayraddin a&s;&s;umed the &s;ame name, and the kingdom of Algiers. This Bar|baro&s;&s;a is better known to the European annali&s;t for rendering his dominions trib|utary to the Grand Seignior. He en|larged his power with a body of the Turk|i&s;h &s;oldiers; and, being promoted to the command of the Turki&s;h fleet, he &s;pread the fame of the Ottoman power through all Europe: for though obliged by the &s;uperiour power of the Emperour Charles fifth to relinqui&s;h his conque&s;t of Tunis, which he had effected by a &s;imilar treach|ery, with which his brother had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of Algiers; yet his being the acknowledged rival of Andrew Doria, the fir&s;t &s;ea commander of his age, has laurelled his brow among tho&s;e, who e&s;|teem

glory to con&s;i&s;t in carnage. This Barbaro&s;&s;a built a mole for the protection of the harbour of Algiers, in which, it is &s;aid, he employed thirty thou&s;and chri&s;|tian &s;laves, and died a natural death, and was &s;ucceeded by Ha&s;&s;an Aga, a renega|do from Sardinia, elected by the &s;oldiers, but confirmed by the Grand Seignior, who, taking an advantage of a violent &s;torm, which wrecked the navy of the Emperour Charles fifth, who had invaded his territories, drove that proud emperour from the coa&s;t, defeated the rear of his army, and captured &s;o many of his &s;ol|diers, that the Algerines, it is reported, &s;old many of their pri&s;oners by way of contempt, at the price of an onion per head. Another Ha&s;&s;an, &s;on to the &s;ec|ond Barbaro&s;&s;a, &s;ucceeded and defeated the Spaniards, who invaded his domin|ions under the command of the Count de Alcandara, killed that nobleman, and took above twelve thou&s;and pri&s;oners.

But his &s;ucce&s;&s;our, Mahomet, merited the mo&s;t of his country, when, by ingratiat|ing him&s;elf with the Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, by incorporating them with his own troops, he annihilated the conte&s;ts of the&s;e fierce rivals, formed a permanent body of brave, di&s;ciplined troops, and enabled his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;our to renounce that dependence upon the Grand Seignior, to which the &s;econd Barbaro&s;&s;a had &s;ubmitted.</P>

In &s;ixteen hundred and thirty &s;even, the Algerine rovers entered the Briti&s;h channel, and made &s;o many captures that, it was con|jectured, near five thou&s;and Engli&s;h were made pri&s;oners by them; and, in the

&s;ame year, they di&s;patched Hall Pinchi|nin with &s;ixteen gallies to rob the rich chapel of our lady of Loretto; which prov|ing un&s;ucce&s;sful, they ravaged the &s;hores of the Adriatic, and &s;o enraged the Ve|netians, that they fitted out a fleet of twenty eight &s;ail, under the command of Admiral Cappello, who, by a late treaty with the Porte, had liberty to enter any of its harbours, to de&s;troy the Algerine gal|lies. Cappello was ordered by the Ve|netians to &s;ink, burn, and de&s;troy, without mercy, all the cor&s;airs of the enemy, and he bravely and &s;ucce&s;sfully executed his commi&s;&s;ion. He immediately overtook and defeated Pinchinin, di&s;abled five of his gallies; and, this Algerine retreat|ing to Valona and landing his booty, where he erected batteries for its defence, the brave Cappello manned his boats and &s;mall craft, and captured his whole fleet. In the&s;e actions, about twelve hun|dred Algerines were &s;lain; and, what
<PB N="109" REF="032945_0318_0FF5EBE8212B0EF0">
was more plea&s;ing, &s;ixteen hundred chri&s;|tian galley &s;laves &s;et at liberty. Hi&s;tory affords no in&s;tance of a people, &s;o repeat|edly and &s;uddenly recovering their lo&s;&s;|es, as the Algerines. Within a few years, we find them fitting out &s;eventy &s;ail of armed ve&s;&s;els, and making &s;uch daring and de&s;perate attacks upon the commerce of nations, that the mo&s;t haugh|ty maritime powers of Europe were more anxious, to &s;helter them&s;elves under a treaty and pay an humiliating tribute, than to attempt nobly to reduce them to rea&s;on and humanity. But, after many ineffectual attempts had been made to unite the force of Europe again&s;t them, the gallant French, by the command of Louis fourteenth, again rou&s;ed them&s;elves to cha&s;ten this intractable race. In &s;ix|teen hundred and eighty two, the Mar|quis du Que&s;ne, with a large fleet and &s;everal bomb ketches, reached Algiers; and, with his &s;ea mortars, bombarded it &s;o
<PB N="110" REF="032945_0319_0FF5EC201F64D1C8">
violently that, he laid almo&s;t the whole city in ruins. Whether his orders went no further, or the vice admiral judged he had cha&s;ti&s;ed them &s;ufficiently, or wheth|er a violent &s;torm drove his fleet from its moorings, does not appear. But it is cer|tain, that he left the city abruptly; and the Algerines, to revenge this in&s;ult, im|mediately &s;ent their fleet to the coa&s;t of France, and took &s;ignal reparation.</P>
<P>The next year, Du Que&s;ne ca&s;t anchor before Algiers with a larger fleet; and, for forty eight hours, made &s;uch deadly di&s;|charges with his cannon, and &s;howered &s;o many bombs over this devoted city, that the Dey &s;ued for peace.</P>
<P>The French admiral with that gener|o&s;ity, which is peculiar to his nation, in|&s;i&s;ted, as an indi&s;pen&s;able preliminary, that all the chri&s;tian &s;laves &s;hould be &s;ent on board his &s;quadron, with Mezemorto the Dey's admiral, as a ho&s;tage for the performance of this preliminary article.
<PB N="111" REF="032945_0320_0FF5EBEA390434E8">
The Dey a&s;&s;embled his divan, or council of great officers, and communicated the French demands. Mezemorto immedi|ately collected the &s;ailors, who had man|ned the ramparts, and with whom he was a favourite; and, accu&s;ing the Dey of cowardice, he &s;o inflamed them that, be|ing joined by the &s;oldiers, they murdered the Dey, and elected Mezemorto in his &s;tead. This was a &s;ignal for re|newed ho&s;tility, and never was there a &s;cene of greater carnage. The French &s;eemed to have re&s;erved their fire for this moment, when they poured &s;uch ince&s;&s;ant vollies of red hot &s;hot, bombs, and car|ca&s;&s;es into the city, that it was nearly all in flames. The &s;treets run blood, while the politic and furious Mezemorto, dread|ing a change in the public mind, and con&s;cious that another ce&s;&s;ation of arms would be attended with his death or de|livery to the French, ran furiou&s;ly round the ramparts and exhorted the military to
<PB N="112" REF="032945_0321_0FF5EC21A4853670">
their duty; and, to make his new &s;ub|jects de&s;perate, cau&s;ed all the French &s;laves to be murdered; and, &s;eizing the French con&s;ul, who had been a pri&s;oner among them, &s;ince the fir&s;t declaration of war, he ordered him to be tied hand and foot, and placed over a bomb mortar and &s;hot into the air towards the French fleet. The French were &s;o highly enraged, the &s;ailors could &s;carce be prevented from attempting to land, and de&s;troy this barbarous race. The vice admiral contented him&s;elf with levelling their fortifications, reducing the city to rubbi&s;h, and burning their whole fleet. A fair opportunity now pre&s;ent|ed of preventing the Algerines from again mole&s;ting commerce. If the European maritime powers had by treaty engaged them&s;elves to de&s;troy the fir&s;t armed gal|ley of the Algerines, which appeared up|on the &s;eas, and conjointly forbidden them to repair their fortifications; this peo|ple might ere this have from nece&s;&s;ity

turned their attention to commerce; the mi&s;creants and outca&s;ts of other nations would have no longer found refuge a|mong them; and this people might at this time have been as celebrated for the peace|ful arts, as they are odious for the con|&s;tant violation of the laws of nations and humanity. This was &s;urely the com|mon intere&s;t of the European powers; but to talk of their common intere&s;t is idle. The narrow politics of Europe &s;eek an individual not a common good; for no &s;ooner had France humbled the Alge|rines than England thought it more for her intere&s;t to enter into a treaty with the new Dey, and, by way of douceur, &s;ent to Algiers a &s;hip load of naval and military &s;tores, to help them to rebuild their navy and &s;trengthen their fortre&s;&s;es; while France, jealous le&s;t the affections of the mon&s;ter Mezemorto, who barba|rou&s;ly murdered their fellow citizens, &s;hould be attached to their rival the En|gli&s;h,

immediately patched up a peace with the Algerines upon the mo&s;t favour|able terms to the latter; and, to conclude the farce, &s;ent them another &s;hip load of &s;imilar materials of &s;uperiour value to tho&s;e, pre&s;ented by the Engli&s;h. This, my readers, is a &s;mall &s;pecimen of Euro|pean policy.</P>
<P>The late&s;t authentic account of any at|tack upon the Algerines was on the twen|ty third of June, one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and &s;eventy five; when the Span|iards &s;ent the Count O'Rally with a re|&s;pectable fleet, twenty four thou&s;and land forces, and a prodigious train of artillery, to de&s;troy the city. The count landed about two thirds of his troops, about a league and an half to the ea&s;tward of the city; but, upon marching into the coun|try, they were oppo&s;ed by an immen&s;e army of natives. The Spaniards &s;ay, it con&s;i&s;ted of one hundred and fifty thou|&s;and, probably exaggerated by their ap|prehen&s;ions.
<PB N="115" REF="032945_0324_0FF5EBED4F3BB820">
This is certain, they had force &s;ufficient, or &s;uperiour &s;kill to de|feat the Spaniards, who retreated to their &s;hips with the lo&s;s of thirteen cannon, &s;ome howitzers, and three thou&s;and killed, be|&s;ides pri&s;oners; while they de&s;troyed &s;ix thou&s;and Algerines. No &s;ooner had the treaty of Paris, in one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty two, completely lib|erated the United States from their de|pendence upon the Briti&s;h nation than that haughty, exa&s;perated power, anxious to &s;hew their late coloni&s;ts the value of that protection, under which their ve&s;&s;els had heretofore navigated the Mediterra|nean, excited the Algerines to capture the &s;hipping of the United States, who, following from nece&s;&s;ity the policy of European nations, concluded a treaty with this piratical &s;tate on the fifth of Sep|tember, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety five.</P>

<P>De&s;cription of the City of Algiers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I CANNOT give &s;o particular a de&s;cription of this city, as I could wi&s;h, or my readers may de&s;ire. Perhaps no town contains &s;o many places impervious to &s;trangers. The interiour of the Dey's palace, and the female apartment of every hou&s;e are &s;ecluded even from the natives. No one approaches them but their re&s;pec|tive ma&s;ters, while no &s;tranger is permitted to in&s;pect the fortifications; and the mo&s;ques, or churches, are &s;crupulou&s;ly guarded from the polluted &s;teps of the un|believer. A poor &s;lave, branded as an infi|del,
<PB N="118" REF="032945_0327_0FF5EC28D7DD19B0">
would obtain only general information from a re&s;idence in the mid&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Algiers is &s;ituated in the bay of that name, and built upon the &s;ea &s;hore, an eminence, which ri&s;es above it, and which naturally gave the di&s;tinction of the up|per and lower city. Towards the &s;ea, it is &s;trengthened with va&s;t fortifications, which are continued upon the mole, which &s;ecures the port from &s;torms and a&s;&s;aults. I never perambulated it, but &s;hould judge that, a line drawn from the we&s;t arm of the mole, and extended by land, until it terminated on the ea&s;t, com|prehending the buildings, would mea&s;ure about two miles. It contains one hun|dred and twenty mo&s;ques, two hundred and twenty public baths, and innumera|ble coffee hou&s;es. The mo&s;ques are large &s;tone buildings, not lofty in propor|tion to their extent on the ground, and have u&s;ually erected, upon their corners, &s;mall &s;quare towers or minarets, whence
<PB N="119" REF="032945_0328_0FF5EBF30E339AD8">
the inferiour prie&s;ts call the people to prayers. The baths are convenient buildings, lighted on the top, provided with cold and warm waters, which you mingle at your plea&s;ure, in &s;mall marble ci&s;terns, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of bra&s;s cocks. Every bather pays two rials at his en|trance, for which he is accommodated with a dre&s;&s;ing room, contiguous to the bathing ci&s;tern, towels, fle&s;h bru&s;hes, and other conveniences, a gla&s;s of &s;herbet, and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, if he choo&s;es. The coffee hou&s;es or rooms are generally piazzas, with an opening over them, projecting from the front of the hou&s;es into the &s;treets. Here the inhabitants delight to loll, to drink &s;herbet, &s;ip coffee, and chew opium, or &s;moak tobacco, &s;teeped in a decoction of this exhilarating drug.</P>
<P>I have already &s;ketched a de&s;cription of the hou&s;es, and &s;hall only add, that the roofs are nearly flat with a &s;mall declivity to ca&s;t the rain water into &s;pouts. Al|giers
<PB N="120" REF="032945_0329_0FF5EC2AEFFE1E18">
is tolerably well &s;upplied with &s;pring water, conveyed in pipes from the back country; but the Algerines, who are im|moderately attached to bathing, prefer rain water, as be&s;t adapted to that u&s;e, con&s;idering it a luxury in compari&s;on with that, obtained from the &s;prings or &s;ea.</P>
<P>The inhabitants &s;ay, Algiers contains twenty thou&s;and hou&s;es, one hundred and forty thou&s;and believers, twenty two thou&s;and Jews, and &s;ix thou&s;and chri&s;tian &s;laves. I &s;u&s;pect, Algerine vani|ty has exaggerated the truth; but I can|not contradict it.

<P>The Government of the Algerines.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been noticed that Hay|raddin Barbaro&s;&s;a, in the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, rendered his kingdom tributary to the Grand Seignior; and that, in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and twenty three, the Algerines threw off their dependence on the &s;ublime Porte. Since that time, the Turki&s;h court have made &s;everal attempts to reduce the Al|gerines to their &s;ubjection; and, by &s;id|ing with the numerous pretenders to the regency, &s;o common in this un&s;table gov|ernment, they have, at times, apparently effected their de&s;ign: while the Alge|rines, by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating or dethroning tho&s;e
<PB N="122" REF="032945_0331_0FF5EC2D166A4FD0">
princes, who&s;e weakne&s;s or wants have in|duced them to &s;ubmit to extraneous power, have reduced their dependence on the &s;ub|lime Porte to a mere name. At pre&s;ent, the Grand Seignior, fearful of lo&s;ing the very &s;hadow of authority, he has over them, contents him&s;elf with receiving a tribute al|mo&s;t nominal; con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of a pre&s;ent, towards defraying the expen&s;es of the annual canopy, which is &s;ent to a|dorn the prophet's tomb at Medina: while, on the other hand, the Algerines, dread|ing the Grand Seignior's interference in their popular commotions, allow the &s;ub|lime Porte to confirm the election of their Dey, and to badge his name, by affixing and terminating it with tho&s;e of the prin|cipal officers of the Turki&s;h government. Hence the pre&s;ent Dey, who&s;e real name is Ha&s;&s;an, is &s;tyled Vizier, which is al&s;o the appellation of the Grand Seignior's fir&s;t mini&s;ter. As Ba&s;haw, which ter|minates the Dey's name, is the Turki&s;h

title of their viceroys and principal com|manders, he makes war or peace, negoti|ates treaties, coins money, and performs every other act of ab&s;olute independence.</P>
<P>Nor is the Dey le&s;s independent of his own &s;ubjects. Though he obtains his office frequently by the election of a fu|rious &s;oldiery, and wades to the regency through the blood of his predece&s;&s;or; yet he is no &s;ooner inve&s;ted with the in&s;ignia of office, than, an implicit reverence is paid to his commands, even by his fero|cious electors; and, though he often &s;ummons his divan or council of great of|ficers, yet they are merely advi&s;ory. He conducts foreign affairs, at his own good plea&s;ure; and, as to internal, he knows no re&s;traint, except from certain local cu&s;|toms, opinions, and tenets, which he him&s;elf venerates, in common with his meane&s;t &s;ubjects. Ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered in his name. He even determines controver|&s;ies in his own per&s;on, be&s;ides being &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="124" REF="032945_0333_0FF5EC2FC9F178A0">
virtually pre&s;ent in the per&s;ons of his cadis or judges. If he inclines to in|terfere in the determination of a &s;uit, upon his approach, the authority of the cadis cea&s;e, and is merged in that of the Dey. Some cu&s;toms have been intimated, which re&s;train the Dey's de&s;poti&s;m. The&s;e re|late principally to religion, property, and females. He will not condemn a prie&s;t to death; and, although up|on the decea&s;e of a &s;ubject, his landed property immediately e&s;cheats to the reigning Dey, yet he never &s;eizes it, in the life of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and, when a man is executed for the highe&s;t crime, the females of his family are treated with re&s;pect; nay, even in an in&s;urrection of the &s;ol|diery, when they murdered their Dey, neither they nor his &s;ucce&s;&s;our violat|ed the female apartments of the &s;lain. A mere love of novelty in the &s;oldiery, the wi&s;h to &s;hare the large&s;&s;es of a new &s;overeign, the policy of his courtiers,

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Dey's revenue is &s;tated by writers at &s;even hundred thou&s;and dollars per annum. If the limits of this work would permit, I think I could prove it under rated, from a view of his expenditures. It ari&s;es from a &s;light tax up|on his &s;ubjects, a tribute from &s;ome Moors and tribes of Arabs, in the interiour country; a capitation tax upon the Jews; prizes taken at &s;ea; pre&s;ents from foreign powers, as the price of peace; annual &s;ub|&s;idies from tho&s;e nations, with whom he is in alliance; and cu&s;tomary pre&s;ents made by his courtiers on his birth day,
<PB N="127" REF="032945_0336_0FF5EBFB6D758320">
To the&s;e may be added &s;ums, &s;queezed from his Ba&s;haws in the government of the interiour provinces, and from the Jews, as the price of their protection. With the&s;e &s;upplies he has to &s;upport the mag|nificene of his court, defray the expen&s;e of foreign emba&s;&s;ies, pay his army, &s;upply his navy, and repair his fortifications; and, by frequent gratuities, if he is not ve|ry &s;ucce&s;sful and popular, &s;upport his in|tere&s;t among tho&s;e, who have the power to dethrone him. His proportion of the prizes, captured at &s;ea, and the concilia|tory pre&s;ents, made by the commercial powers, are the principal &s;ources of his revenue. It is obviou&s;ly the policy of the Dey, by frequently enfringing his treaties, to augment his finances, by new captures or fre&s;h premiums for his friend&s;hip. A pacific Dey is &s;ure not to reign long; for, be&s;ide the di&s;gu&s;t of the formidable body of &s;ailors, who are emulous of employ, when the reigning Dey has once gone

through the routine of &s;eizing the ve&s;&s;els, receiving the pre&s;ents, and concluding treaties with the u&s;ual foreign powers, he finds that the annual payments, &s;ecured by treaties, are in&s;ufficient for the main|tenance of his nece&s;&s;ary expenditures; and is therefore con&s;trained frequently to declare war as a principle of &s;elf pre&s;|ervation. I have been told, the pre&s;ent Dey conde&s;cended to explain the&s;e prin|ciples to an American agent in Algiers, and grounded his capturing the Ameri|can &s;hipping upon this nece&s;&s;ity. I mu&s;t, &s;aid the Dey, be at war with &s;ome nation, and yours mu&s;t have its turn. When the Dey, from a pacific di&s;po&s;ition or dread of foreign power, is at peace with the world, the di&s;gu&s;ted &s;ailor and avaricious &s;oldier join to dethrone him; having e&s;tabli&s;hed it, as a maxim, that all treaties expire with the reigning Dey, and mu&s;t be renewed with his &s;ucce&s;&s;our.

<P>THERE are but few ve&s;&s;els actually belonging to the Dey's navy.

I can give but a &s;lender account of his land forces. Tho&s;e in e&s;tabli&s;hed pay are &s;aid to amount to about eight thou&s;and foot, and two thou&s;and Moori&s;h hor&s;e. To
<PB N="131" REF="032945_0340_0FF5EBFF30CB9F78">
the&s;e may be added four thou&s;and inhab|itants of the city, who enrol them&s;elves as &s;oldiers, for protection in military tu|mults, receive no pay, but are liable to be called upon to man the fortifications in emergency, in&s;urrection, or inva&s;ion. Perhaps there are more of this &s;pecies in the provinces. The hor&s;e are cantoned in the country round the city, and do du|ty by detachments at the palace. Three thou&s;and foot are &s;tationed in the fortifi|cations, and mar&s;halled as the Dey's guards. The re&s;idue of the land forces are di&s;tributed among the Ba&s;haws to o|verawe the provinces. But the princi|pal reliance, in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion, is the va&s;t bodies of what may be &s;tyled mili|tia, which the Ba&s;haws, in ca&s;e of emer|gency, lead from the interiour country.</P>

<P>THE men wear next to their bodies a linen &s;hirt, or rather chemi&s;e, and drawers of the &s;ame texture. Over their &s;hirt a linen or &s;ilk gown, which is girded about their loins by a &s;a&s;h, in the choice of which they exhibit much fancy. In this dre&s;s their legs and lower extrem|ity of their arms are bare. As an outer garment, a loo&s;e coat of coar&s;er materials is thrown over the whole. They wear turbans, which are long pieces of mu&s;lin
<PB N="133" REF="032945_0342_0FF5EC01D6472BB8">
or &s;ilk curiou&s;ly folded, &s;o as to form a cap comfortable and ornamental. Slip|pers are u&s;ually worn, though the &s;ol|diers are provided with a &s;ort of bu&s;kin, re&s;embling our half boots. The dre&s;s of the women, I am told, for I never had the plea&s;ure of in&s;pecting it very critical|ly, re&s;embles that of the men, except that their drawers are longer, and their out &s;ide garment is like our old fa&s;hioned riding hoods. When the ladies walk the &s;treets, they are muffled with bandages or hand|kerchiefs of mu&s;lin or &s;ilk over their faces, which conceals all but their eyes; and, if too nearly in&s;pected, will let fall a large vail, which conceals them intirely. The men u|&s;ually &s;et cro&s;s legged upon mattre&s;&s;es, laid upon low &s;eats at the &s;ides of the room. They loll on cu&s;hions at their meals; and, after their repa&s;ts, occa&s;ionally indulge with a &s;hort &s;lumber. I have &s;uch a lauda|ble attachment to the cu&s;toms of my own country, that I doubt whether I can
<PB N="134" REF="032945_0343_0FF5EC39B82E9D38">
judge candidly of their cookery or mode of eating. The former would be unpal|atable and the latter di&s;gu&s;ting to mo&s;t A|mericans; for &s;affron is their common &s;ea&s;oning. They cook their provi&s;ions to rags or pap, and eat it with their fin|gers, though the better &s;ort u&s;e &s;poons. Their diver&s;ions con&s;i&s;t in a&s;&s;ociating in the coffee hou&s;es, in the city, and, in the country, under groves, where they &s;moke and chat, and drink cooling not inebri|ating liquors. Their more active amu&s;e|ments are riding and throwing the dart, at both which they are very expert. They &s;ometimes play at che&s;s and drafts, but never at games of chance or for mon|ey; tho&s;e being expre&s;sly forbidden by the alcoran.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is the privilege of travellers to exaggerate; but I wi&s;h not o avail my&s;elf of this pre&s;criptive right. I had rather di&s;appoint the curio&s;ity of my readers by conci&s;ene&s;s, than di&s;gu&s;t them with untruths. I have no ambition to be
<PB N="136" REF="032945_0345_0FF5EC3C12F4D820">
ranked among the Bruces and Cha&s;tel|reux of the age. I &s;hall therefore endeav|our rather to improve the under&s;tanding of my reader, with what I really know, than amu&s;e him with &s;tories, of which my circum&s;cribed &s;ituation rendered me nece&s;&s;arily ignorant. I never was at an Algerine marriage; but obtained &s;ome authentic information on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>That extreme caution, which &s;eparates the &s;exes in elder life, is al&s;o attached to the youth. In Algiers, the young peo|ple never collect to dance, conver&s;e, or a|mu&s;e them&s;elves with the innocent gaities of their age. Here are no theatres, balls, or concerts; and, even in the pub|lic duties of religion, the &s;exes never a&s;|&s;emble together. An Algerine court&s;hip would be as di&s;agreeable to the hale youth of New England, as a common bundling would be di&s;gu&s;ting to the Mu&s;&s;ulman. No opportunity is afforded to the young &s;uitor to &s;earch for tho&s;e namele&s;s bewitch|ing
<PB N="137" REF="032945_0346_0FF5EC056D76B7B8">
qualities and attentions, which attach the American youth to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and form the ba&s;is of connubial bli&s;s; nor is the young Algerine permitted, by a thou|&s;and tender a&s;&s;iduities, to win the affec|tions of the future partner of his life. His choice can be only directed by the rank or re&s;pectability of the father of his intended bride. He never &s;ees her face, until after the nuptial ceremony is per|formed; and even &s;ome days after &s;he has been brought home to his own hou&s;e. The old people frequently make the match, or, if it originates with the youth, he con&s;ides his wi&s;hes to his father or &s;ome re&s;pectable relation, who communi|cates the propo&s;al to the lady's father. If he receives it favourably, the young couple are allowed to exchange &s;ome un|meaning me&s;&s;ages, by an old nur&s;e of the family. The bride's father or her next male kin, with the bridegroom, go before the Cadi and &s;ign a contract of marriage,
<PB N="138" REF="032945_0347_0FF5EC3DB1633428">
which is atte&s;ted by the relatives on each &s;ide. The bridegroom then pays a &s;tip|ulated &s;um to the bride' father; the nup|tial ceremony is performed in private, and the bridegroom retires. After &s;ome days, the bride is richly arrayed, accom|panied by females, and conveyed in a covered coach or waggon, gaudy with flowers, to her hu&s;band's hou&s;e. Here &s;he is immediately immured in the wom|en's apartments, while the bridegroom and his friends &s;hare a convivial fea&s;t. After &s;ome ceremonies, the nature of which I could not di&s;cover, the bride|groom enters the women's apartment, and for the fir&s;t time di&s;covers whether his wife has a no&s;e or eyes. Among the higher ranks, it is &s;aid, the bride, after the expiration of a month, goes to the public bath for women, is there receiv|ed with great parade, and loaded with pre&s;ents by her female relations, a&s;|&s;embled on the occa&s;ion. The bride|groom
<PB N="139" REF="032945_0348_0FF5EC079A8A8670">
al&s;o receives pre&s;ents from his friends.</P>
<P>Within a limited time, the hu&s;band may break the contract, provided he will add another item to that already given, return his bride with all her parapherna|lia; and, putting the holy alcoran to his brea&s;t, a&s;&s;ert that he never benefited him|&s;elf of the rights of an hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the apparent re&s;traint, the women are under, they are &s;aid to be attached to their hu&s;bands, and enjoy greater liberty than is generally conceiv|ed. I certainly &s;aw many women in the &s;treets, &s;o muffled up, and &s;o &s;imilar from their outward garment, that their neare&s;t relatives could not di&s;tingui&s;h one from another. The vulgar &s;laves conjecture that the women take great liberties in this general di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Their funerals are decent but not o&s;|tentatious. I &s;aw many. The corps, car|ried upon a bier, is preceded by the prie&s;ts,
<PB N="140" REF="032945_0349_0FF5EC407829EE00">
chanting pa&s;&s;ages from the alcoran in a dolorous tone. Wherever the proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;es, the people join in this dirge. The relatives follow, with the folds of their turbans loo&s;ened. The bodies of the rich are depo&s;ited in vaults, tho&s;e of the poor, in graves. A pillar of marble is erected over them, with an unblown ro&s;e carved on the top for the unmarried.</P>
<P>At certain &s;ea&s;ons, the women of the family join a proce&s;&s;ion in clo&s;e habits, and proceed to the tomb or grave, and a|dorn it with garlands of flowers. When the&s;e proce&s;&s;ions pa&s;s, the &s;laves are o|bliged to throw them&s;elves on the ground with their faces in the du&s;t, and all, of whatever rank, cover their faces.</P>

<P>The Religion of the Algerines: Life of the Prophet Mahomet.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN de&s;cribing the religious ten|ets of the Algerines, the attention is im|mediately drawn to Mahomet or Ma|homed, the founder of their faith.</P>
<P>This fortunate impo&s;tor, like all other great characters in the drama of life, has been indignantly vilified by his oppo|nents, and as ardently prai&s;ed by his ad|herents. I &s;hall endeavour to &s;teer the middle cour&s;e of impartiality; neither influenced by the biggoted aver&s;ion of
<PB N="142" REF="032945_0351_0FF5EC4287001958">
Sales and Prideaux, or the &s;pecious prai&s;e of the <HI>philo&s;ophic Boulanvilliers.</HI></P>
<P>Mahomet was born in the five hun|dred and &s;ixty ninth year of the chri&s;tian era. He was de&s;cended from the Coreis, one of the noble&s;t of the Arabian tribes. His father, Abdalla, was a man of moder|ate fortune, and be&s;towed upon his &s;on &s;uch an education as a parent in confined, if not impoveri&s;hed circum&s;tances, could confer. The Turks &s;ay, he could not write; becau&s;e they pride them&s;elves in decrying letters, and becau&s;e the pious among them &s;uppo&s;e his ignorance of let|ters a &s;ufficient evidence of the divine o|riginal of the book, he publi&s;hed, as re|ceived from and written by the finger of Deity.</P>
<P>But when the Arabian authors record, that he was employed as a factor by his un|cle Abutileb, there can little doubt remain but that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the litera|ry acquirements, nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h
<PB N="143" REF="032945_0352_0FF5C41A2836F7B8">
him for his bu&s;ine&s;s. He has been &s;tig|matized as a mere camel driver. He had the direction of camels it is true. The merchandize of Arabia was tran&s;|ported to different regions by carri|vans of the&s;e u&s;eful animals, of a troop of which he was conductor; but there was as much difference between his &s;tation and employment, and that of a common camel driver, as between the &s;upercargo of an India &s;hip in our days, and the &s;eaman before the ma&s;t. In his capacity of factor, he travelled into Syr|ia, Pale&s;tine, and Egypt; and acquired the mo&s;t u&s;eful knowledge in each coun|try. He is repre&s;ented as a man of a beautiful per&s;on, and commanding pre&s;|ence. By his engaging manners and re|markable attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, he became the factor of a rich Arabian merchant, after who&s;e death he married his widow, the beautiful Cadija, and came into the lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of immen&s;e wealth, which
<PB N="144" REF="032945_0353_0FF5EC44B6F35260">
awakened in him the mo&s;t unbounded ambition. By the venerable cu&s;tom of his nation, his political career was con|fined to his own tribe; and, the patri|archal being the prominent feature of the Arabian government, he could not hope to &s;urmount the claims of elder families, even in his own tribe, the genealogies of which were accurately pre&s;erved. To be the founder and prophet of a new re|ligion would &s;ecure a glorious preemi|nence, highly gratifying to his ambition, and not thwarting the preten&s;ions of the tribes.</P>
<P>Mankind are apt to impute the mo&s;t profound abilities to &s;ounders of religious &s;y&s;tems, and other fortunate adventurers, when perhaps they owe their &s;ucce&s;s more to a fortunate coincidence of circum|&s;tances, and their only merit is the &s;a|gacity to avail them&s;elves of that tide in the affairs of men, which leads to wealth and honour. Perhaps there never was a
<PB N="145" REF="032945_0354_0FF5EC0E3B8A9590">
conjuncture more favourable for the in|troduction of a new religion than that, of which Mahomet availed him&s;elf. He was &s;urrounded by Arian chri&s;tians, who&s;e darling creed is the unity of the Deity, and who had been per&s;ecuted by the Athena&s;ians into an abhorrence of almo&s;t every other chri&s;tian tenet: by Jews, who had fled from the vindictive Emperour Adrian, and who, too willful|ly blind to &s;ee the accompli&s;hment of their prophecies in the per&s;on of our Sa|viour, in the mid&s;t of exile were ready to contemn tho&s;e prophecies, which had &s;o long deluded them with a Me&s;&s;iah, who nev|er came: and by Pagans, who&s;e belief in a plurality of gods made them the ready pro&s;elytes of any novel &s;y&s;tem; and the more wi&s;e of whom were di&s;gu&s;ted with the gro&s;s ad&s;urdities of their own mythol|ogy. The &s;y&s;tem of Mahomet is &s;aid to have been calculated to attach all the&s;e. To gratify the Arian and the Jew, he
<PB N="146" REF="032945_0355_0FF5EC4783DD8468">
maintained the unity of God; and, to plea&s;e the Pagans, he adopted many of their external rites, as fa&s;tings, wa&s;hings, &amp;c;. Certain it is, he &s;poke of Mo&s;es and the patriarchs, as me&s;&s;engers from heaven, and that he declared Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be the true Me&s;&s;ias, and the exemplary pat|tern of a good life, a &s;entiment critically expre&s;&s;ing the Arian opinion. The &s;to|ries of Mahomet's having retired to a cave with a monk and a Jew to compile his book; and falling into fits of the epi|lep&s;y, per&s;uading his di&s;ciples that the&s;e &s;its were trances in order to propagate his &s;y&s;tem more effectually, &s;o often related by geography compilers, like the tales of Pope Joan and the nag's head con&s;ecra|tion of the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops, are fit only to amu&s;e the vulgar. It is certain, he &s;eclud|ed him&s;elf from company and a&s;&s;umed an au&s;terity of manners, becoming the reformer of a vicious world. In his re|tirement, he commenced writing the al|coran.
<PB N="147" REF="032945_0356_0FF5EC0FC78D0778">
His fir&s;t pro&s;elytes were of his own family, the next, of his near rela|tives. But the tribe of Corei were &s;o fa|miliar with the per&s;on and life of Maho|met that they de&s;pi&s;ed his preten&s;ions; and, fearful le&s;t what they &s;tyled his mad enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;hould bring a &s;tigma upon their tribe, they fir&s;t attempted to rea&s;on him out of his &s;uppo&s;ed delu&s;ion; and, this failing, they &s;ought to de&s;troy him. But a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger of heaven, who, Mahomet &s;ays, mea&s;ured ten million fur|longs at every &s;tep, informed him of their de&s;ign, and he fled to Medina, the inhab|itants of which, being already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of his doctrine, received him with great re&s;pect. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This flight was in the &s;ix hundred and twen|ty &s;econd year of the chri&s;tian era, when Maho|met was fifty four years of age.

He &s;oon in&s;pired them with the mo&s;t implicit confidence in the divinity of his mi&s;&s;ion, and confirmed their faith by dai|ly portions of the alcoran, which he de|clared was written by the finger of God, and tran&s;mitted to him immediately from heaven by archangels, commi&s;&s;ioned for that important purpo&s;e. He declared him&s;elf the <HI>Sent of God,</HI> the &s;word of his almighty power, commi&s;&s;ioned to enforce the unity of the divine e&s;&s;ence, the unchangea|blene&s;s of his eternal decrees, the future bli&s;s of true believers, and the torment of the damned, among the nations. He boldly pronounced all tho&s;e who died fighting in his cau&s;e, to be entitled to the glory of martyrs in the heavenly paradi&s;e; and, availing him&s;elf of &s;ome of the an|tient &s;euds among the neighbouring tribes, cau&s;ed his di&s;ciples in Medina to wage war upon their neighbours, and they invariably conquered, when he headed their troops.

He &s;ubdued the greater part of Arabia, and obtained a re&s;pectable footing in Syria. He died at Medina in the year &s;ix hun|dred and thirty three, and in the &s;ixty fourth year of his age. European writ|ers, who have de&s;troyed almo&s;t as many great per&s;onages by poi&s;on as the French have with the guillotine, have attributed his death to a do&s;e admini&s;tered by a monk.

<P>UPON the decea&s;e of the prophet, his followers were almo&s;t con|founded. They could &s;carce credit their &s;en&s;es. They fancied him only in a &s;woon, and waited in re&s;pectful &s;ilence until he &s;hould again ari&s;e to lead them to conque&s;t and glory. His more con|fidential friends gathered around the corp&s;e; and, being impre&s;&s;ed with the policy of immediately announcing his &s;ucce&s;&s;our, they held a fierce debate upon the &s;ubject. In the alcoran, they found no direction for the election, nor any &s;uc|ce&s;&s;our to the caliphate pointed out.
<PB N="151" REF="032945_0360_0FF5EC818D084DC0">
They agreed to &s;end for his wives and confidential dome&s;tics. The younge&s;t of his wives produced &s;ome writings, containing the precious &s;ayings of the prophet, which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had collect|ed for her own edification. To the&s;e were afterwards added &s;uch ob&s;ervations of the prophet, as his more intimate a&s;&s;oci|ates could recollect, or the policy of tho&s;e in power invent. The&s;e were annexed to the alcoran, and e&s;teemed of equal au|thority. This compilation was called the book of the companions of the apo&s;|tle. In the writings, produced by his fa|vourite wife, the prophet had directed his great officers to elect his &s;ucce&s;&s;our from among them, and a&s;&s;ured them that a portion of his own power would re&s;t up|on him. Abubeker, a friend and relative, and &s;ucce&s;sful leader of the forces of the Prophet, by the per&s;ua&s;ions of tho&s;e a|round, immediately entered the public mo&s;que; and, &s;tanding on the &s;teps of

the de&s;k, from which the prophet u&s;ed to deliver his oracles, he informed the mul|titude that God had indeed called the prophet to paradi&s;e, and that his kingly authority and apo&s;tolic powers re&s;ted up|on him. To him &s;ucceeded Omar and O&s;man: while the troops in Syria, con|ceiving that Ali, their leader, was better entitled to &s;ucceed than either, elevated him al&s;o to the caliphate, though he refu&s;|ed the dignity until he was called by the voice of the people to &s;ucceed O&s;man. Hence &s;prang that great &s;chi&s;m, which has divided the Mu&s;&s;ulman world; but, though divided, as to the &s;ucce&s;&s;our of the prophet, both parties were actuated by his principles and adhered to his creed. Omar and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ours turned their arms towards Europe; and, under the name of Saracens or Moors, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the greater part of Spain and the Mediterranean i&s;les: while the friends of Ali, e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves as

and the &s;ublime&s;t conceptions of the Deity. The fundamental doctrine of the alcoran is the unity of God. The evil &s;pirit, &s;ays the koran, is &s;ubtly deluding men, into the belief that there are more gods than one, that in the confu&s;ion of deities he may obtain a &s;hare of devo|tion; while the Supreme Being, pitying the delu&s;ions of man, has &s;ent Abraham, Mo&s;es, Soliman, breathed forth the Me&s;|&s;ias of the chri&s;tian in &s;igh of divine pity, and la&s;tly &s;ent Mahomet, the &s;eal of the prophets, to reclaim men to this e&s;|&s;ential truth. The next fundamental points in the Mu&s;&s;ulman creed are a be|lief in the eternal decrees of God, in a re&s;urrection and final judgment to bli&s;s or mi&s;ery. Some hold with chri&s;tians that the future puni&s;hment will be infinite, while others &s;uppo&s;e that, when the &s;ouls of the wicked are purified by fire, they will be received into the favour of God. They adhere to many other points of

practical duty: &s;uch as daily prayers, fre|quent ablutions, acts of charity and &s;evere fa&s;tings; that of rhammadin, is the principal, which is &s;imilar to the catholic lent, in ab&s;tin|ence, for the penitent ab&s;tains only from a particular kind of food, while he gluts him&s;elf with others perhaps more lu&s;|cious. The alcoran al&s;o forbids games of chance, and the u&s;e of &s;trong liquors; inculcates a tenderne&s;s for idiots, and a re&s;pect for age. The book of the com|panions of the apo&s;tle enjoins a pilgrim|age to his tomb, to be made by the true believers once at lea&s;t in their lives: but though they view the authority, which enjoined this tedious journey divine, yet they have contrived to evade its rigour by allowing the believer to perform it by proxy or attorney.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, there does not appear to be any articles in their faith, which in|cite them to immorality or can counte|nance the cruelties, they commit. Neither

their alcoran nor their prie&s;ts excite them to plunder, in&s;lave or torment. The former expre&s;sly recommends charity, ju&s;tice, and mercy towards their fellow men. I would not bring the &s;acred vol|ume of our faith in any comparative view with the alcoran of Mahomet; but I cannot help noticing it as extraordinary, that the Mahometan &s;hould abominate the chri&s;tian on account of his faith, and the chri&s;tian dete&s;t the Mu&s;&s;ulman for his creed; when the koran of the former acknowledges the divinity of the chri&s;tian Me&s;&s;ias, and the bible of the latter com|mands us to love our enemies.

<P>Why do not the Powers in Europe &s;up|pre&s;s the Algerine Depredations? is a Que&s;tion frequently a&s;ked in the United States.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I ANSWER, that this mu&s;t be effected by a union of the European mari|time powers with the Grand Seignior; by a combination among them&s;elves; or by an individual exertion of &s;ome particular &s;tate. A union of the European powers with the Grand Seignior mo&s;t probably would be attended with &s;ucce&s;s; but this is not to be expected; as it never can be the intere&s;t of the &s;ublime Porte to
<PB N="159" REF="032945_0368_0FF5EC8A69BBC6E0">
&s;uppre&s;s them, and the common faith of the Mu&s;&s;ulman has more influence in uniting its profe&s;&s;ors than the creed of the chri&s;tian, to the di&s;grace of the <HI>latter:</HI> and, as the Grand Seignior's dominion over the Algerines is little more than nominal, he is anxious to conciliate their favour by affording them his protection; con&s;idering prudently, that though in|tractable, they are &s;till a branch of the Mu&s;&s;ulman &s;tock. Provoked by their in&s;ults, he has &s;ometimes withdrawn his protection, as was the ca&s;e, when he by treaty with the Venetians permitted their fleet to enter the Ottoman ports, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of de&s;troying the Alge|rine gallies; but, it is obvious, the &s;ublime Porte meant merely to cha&s;ti&s;e not to ruin them.</P>
<P>In the Grand Seignior's wars with the Europeans, the piratical &s;tates have ren|dered &s;ignal &s;ervices, and he him&s;elf not unfrequently receives valuable douceurs
<PB N="160" REF="032945_0369_0FF5EC55F69BE390">
for exerting his &s;uppo&s;ed influence over them, in favour of one or another of the contending powers of Europe. In the &s;iege of Gibraltar by the Spaniards, dur|ing the late American war, that garri&s;on received frequent &s;upplies of provi&s;ion from the Barbary Shore; but, by the ap|plication of Louis XVI. to the &s;ublime Porte, the Grand Seignior influenced the Barbary &s;tates to prohibit tho&s;e &s;upplies; and the Engli&s;h con&s;ul was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from one of them with the mo&s;t pointed marks of contempt. While the Grand Seign|ior reaps &s;uch &s;olid advantages from them, it is ab&s;urd to predicate upon his cooperation again&s;t them; neither can a union of the European powers be more fully anticipated. Jealou&s;y as often actu|ates mighty nations, as weak individuals. Whoever turns the pages of hi&s;tory with profit, will perceive that &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ion is the impul&s;e of action to the greate&s;t &s;tates. Commercial &s;tates are al&s;o actu|ated

by avarice, a pa&s;&s;ion &s;till more bane|ful in its effects. The&s;e excite war, and are the grand plenipotentiaries in the ad|ju&s;tment of the articles of peace. Hence it is, that, while every European power is &s;olicitous to enrich and aggrandize it&s;elf, it can never join in any common project, the re&s;ult of which, it is jealous, may ad|vantage its neighbour; and is content to &s;uffer injury, rather than its rival &s;hould &s;hare in a common good. Hence it is, that chri&s;tian &s;tates, in&s;tead of uniting to vindicate their in&s;ulted faith, join the cro&s;s and the cre&s;cent in unholy alliance, and form degrading treaties with piratical powers; and, as the acme of political folly, pre&s;ent tho&s;e very powers, as the purcha&s;e of their friend&s;hip, weapons to annoy them&s;elves in the fir&s;t war, that their avarice or caprice &s;hall wage. But, if ever a confederacy of the European powers &s;hould be formed again&s;t the Al|gerines, experience affords us but &s;lender
<PB N="162" REF="032945_0371_0FF5EC5836E07640">
hopes of its &s;ucce&s;s; for, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that from the confederacy of Ahab and Jeho&s;haphat, when they went up to battle to Ramoth Gilead, to the treaty of Philnitz, there never was a combination of princes or nations, who, by an actual union of their forces, attained the object of their coalition. If the political finger is pointed to the war of the allies of Queen Anne, and the conque&s;ts of the Duke of Marlborough, as an exception, I likewi&s;e point to the di&s;tracting period, when that conqueror was &s;uperceded by the Duke of Ormond, and the treaty of Utrecht will confirm the opinion I have advanced.</P>
<P>The detail of the hi&s;tory of the Alge|rines evinces, that the arms of individual &s;tates can be attended with no deci&s;ive &s;ucce&s;s. Indeed, the expen&s;e of an effi|cacious armament would defray the price of the Dey's friend&s;hip for years; and the powers of Europe &s;ubmit to his in|&s;ults and injuries from a principle of e|conomy.
<PB N="163" REF="032945_0372_0FF5EC8F05DFCCA8">
An ab&s;olute conque&s;t of the Algerine territory cannot be effected but by inva&s;ion from the interiour, through the cooperation of the Grand Seignior or the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other Barbary &s;tates. The former I have &s;hewn cannot be pred|icated, and the latter, for obvious rea|&s;ons, is as little to be expected. A per|manent conque&s;t of the city and port of Algiers cannot be effected, without the &s;ubjection of the interiour country. Tem|porary though &s;pirited attacks, upon that city and port, have never an&s;wered any &s;alutary purpo&s;e. They may be com|pared to the de&s;truction of our &s;eaports, in our revolutionary war. The port at|tacked bore &s;o &s;mall a proportion to the whole, that its de&s;truction rather &s;erved to irritate, than to weaken or &s;ubjugate. It &s;hould be con&s;idered, likewi&s;e, that the hou&s;es of the Algerines are built of &s;light and cheap materials; that upon the ap|proach of an enemy the rich effects of the inhabitants are ea&s;ily removed in|land,

while nothing remains but heavy fortifications to batter, and buildings, which can be readily re&s;tored, to de&s;troy. The following anecdote will &s;hew how &s;en&s;ible the Algerines them&s;elves are of the&s;e advantages. When the French vice admiral, the Marquis de Que&s;ne, made his fir&s;t attack on Algiers, he &s;ent an officer with a flag on &s;hore, who magnifi|ed the force of his commander, and threat|ened to lay the city in a&s;hes, if the de|mands of the marquis were not immedi|ately complied with. The Dey, who had, upon the fir&s;t approach of the ene|my, removed the aged, the females and his riche&s;t effects, coolly inquired of the officer how much the levelling his city to a&s;hes would co&s;t. The officer, think|ing to encrea&s;e the Dey's admiration of the power of the Grand Monarque, an|&s;wered, two millions of livres. Tell your commander, &s;aid the Dey, if he will &s;end me half the money I will burn the city of a&s;hes my&s;elf.</P>

<P>An Algerine Law Suit.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AN officer of police parades the city at uncertain hours, and in all di|rections, accompanied by an executioner and other attendants. The proce&s;s of his court is entirely verbal. He examines into all breaches of the cu&s;toms, all frauds, e&s;pecially in weights and mea&s;ures, all &s;udden affrays, di&s;putes concerning per|&s;onal property, and compels the perfor|mance of contracts. He determines cau&s;es on the &s;pot, and the delinquent is puni&s;hed in his pre&s;ence. The u&s;ual puni&s;hments, he inflicts, are fines, beating on the &s;oles of the feet, di&s;memberment

of the right hand; and, it is &s;aid, he has a power of taking life; but, in &s;uch ca&s;e, an appeal lies to the Dey. If complaint is made to him of the military, the prie&s;ts or officers of the court navy, or cu&s;toms, or again&s;t per&s;ons attached to the families of the con&s;uls, envoys, or other repre&s;en|tatives of foreign powers, upon &s;ugge&s;tion, the cau&s;e is immediately reported to the Dey, who hears the &s;ame in per&s;on, or deputes &s;ome officer of rank to determine it, either from the civil, military, or re|ligious orders, as the nature of the cau&s;e may require. In fact, this officer of pol|ice &s;eldom judges any cau&s;e of great im|portance. The object of his commi&s;&s;ion &s;eems to be the detection and puni&s;h|ment of common cheats, and to &s;uppre&s;s broils among the vulgar; and, as he has the power to adapt the puni&s;hment to the enormity of the offence, he often exer|ci&s;es it capriciou&s;ly, and, &s;ometimes, ludi|crou&s;ly. I &s;aw a baker, who, for &s;elling
<PB N="167" REF="032945_0376_0FF5EC929BCA74C8">
bread under weight, was &s;entenced to walk the public market, three times each day, for three days in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, with a &s;mall loaf, attached by a ring to each of his ears; and to cry aloud at &s;hort di&s;tances <HI>"bread for the poor."</HI> This excited the re&s;entment of the rabble, who follow|ed him with abundance of coar&s;e ridicule. Be&s;ides this itinerant judge, there are many others, who never meddle with &s;uits, unle&s;s they are brought formally before them, which is done by mere ver|bal complaint; they &s;end for the parties and witne&s;&s;es, and determine almo&s;t as &s;ummarily as the officer of police. I confe&s;s that, when I left the United States, the golden fee, the lengthy bill of co&s;t, the law's delay, and the writings of Hone&s;|tus, had taught me to view the judicial proceedings of our country with a jaun|diced eye; and, when I was made ac|quainted with the Algerine mode of di&s;|tributive ju&s;tice, I yearned to &s;ee a cau&s;e
<PB N="168" REF="032945_0377_0FF5EC5EAC6CAA58">
determined in a court, where in&s;tant de|ci&s;ion relieved the anxiety, and &s;aved the pur&s;es of the parties; and where no long winded attorney was &s;uffered to perplex the judge with &s;ubtle argument or mu&s;ty precedent. I was &s;oon delighted with an excellent di&s;play of &s;ummary ju&s;tice. Ob&s;erving a collection of people upon a piazza, I leaned over the rails, and di&s;|covered that an Algerine cadi or judge had ju&s;t opened his court. The cadi was &s;eated cro&s;s legged on a cu&s;hion with a &s;lave, with a whip and batten on one &s;ide; and another with a drawn &s;cimitar on the other. The plaintiff came forward and told his &s;tory. He charged a man, who was in cu&s;tody, with having &s;old him a mule, which he &s;aid was &s;ound, but which prov|ed blind and lame. Several witne&s;&s;es were then called, who proved the con|tract and the defects of the mule. The defendant was then called upon for his defence. He did not deny the fact, but
<PB N="169" REF="032945_0378_0FF5EC9659A932D8">
pleaded the law of retaliation. He &s;aid, he was a good Mu&s;&s;ulman, performed all the rites of their holy religion, had &s;ent a proxy to the prophet's tomb at Medina, and maintained an idiot; that he never cheated any man before, but was ju&s;tified in what he had done, for, ten years before, the plaintiff had cheated him wor&s;e in the &s;ale of a dromedary, which proved broken winded. He proved this by &s;ev|eral witne&s;&s;es, and the plaintiff could not deny it. The judge immediately order|ed the mule and the money paid for it to be produced. He then directed his at|tendants to &s;eize the defendant, and give him fifty blows on the &s;oles of his feet for this fraud. The plaintiff at every &s;troke applauded the cadi's ju&s;tice to the &s;kies; but, no &s;ooner was the puni&s;hment inflicted, than, by a nod from the judge, the exulting plaintiff was &s;eized and re|ceived the &s;ame number of blows with the batten for the old affair of the broken
<PB N="170" REF="032945_0379_0FF5EC60CBD73830">
winded dromedary. The parties were then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, without co&s;ts, and the judge ordered an officer to take the mule, &s;ell it at publick outcry, and di&s;tribute the product, with the money depo&s;ited, in alms to the poor. The officer proceeded a few &s;teps with the mule, and, I thought, the court had ri&s;en, when the cadi &s;up|po&s;ing one of the witne&s;&s;es had prevari|cated in his te&s;timony called back the of|ficer, who had charge of the mule, order|ed the witne&s;s to receive twenty five blows of the batten, and be mounted on the back of the mule, with his face to|wards the tail, and be thus carried through the city, directing the mule to be &s;topped at every corner, where the culprit &s;hould exclaim; "before the en|lightened, excellent, ju&s;t, and merciful cadi Mir Karchan, in the trial of O&s;man Beker and Abu I&s;oul, I &s;poke as I ride." The people around magnified Mir Kar|chan for this exemplary ju&s;tice; and I

pre&s;ent it to my fellow citizens. If it is generally plea&s;ing, it may be ea&s;ily intro|duced among us. Some ob&s;tinate peo|ple may be &s;till attached to our cu&s;tomary modes of di&s;pen&s;ing ju&s;tice, and think that the advocates we fee, and the prece|dents they quote, are but guards and en|clo&s;ures round our judges, to prevent them from capriciou&s;ly invading the rights of the citizens.</P>

I pre&s;ent it to the candid reader, as a curious &s;peci|men of their pulpit eloquence; and as, perhaps, conveying a more &s;atisfactory idea of their creed, than I have already attempted, in the account I have given of their religion. The attributes of Deity were the &s;ubject of the prie&s;t's di&s;cour&s;e; and, after &s;ome exordium, he elevated his voice and exclaimed:</P>
<P>GOD ALONE IS IMMORTAL. Ibra|ham and Soliman have &s;lept with their fathers, Cadijah the fir&s;t born of faith, Ayi&s;ha the beloved, Omar the meek, Omri the benevolent, the companions of the apo&s;tle and the Sent of God him&s;elf, all died. But God mo&s;t high, mo&s;t holy, liveth forever. Infinities are to him, as the numerals of arithmetic to the &s;ons of Adam; the earth &s;hall vani&s;h be|fore the decrees of his eternal de&s;tiny; but he liveth and reigneth forever.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="032945_0383_0FF5EC650B9FCCB0">
GOD ALONE IS OMNISCIENT. Mi|chael, who&s;e wings are full of eyes, is blind before him, the dark night is unto him as the rays of the morning; for he noticeth the creeping of the &s;mall pi&s;mire in the dark night, upon the black &s;tone, and apprehendeth the motion of an atom in the open air.</P>
<P>GOD ALONE IS OMNIPRESENT. He toucheth the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, as a point. He moveth in the depths of o|cean, and mount Atlas is hidden by the &s;ole of his foot. He breatheth fragrant odours to cheer the ble&s;&s;ed in paradi&s;e, and enliveneth the pallid flame in the pro|founde&s;t hell.</P>
<P>GOD ALONE IS OMNIPOTENT. He thought, and worlds were created; he frowneth, and they di&s;&s;olve into thin &s;moke; he &s;mileth, and the torments of the damned are &s;u&s;pended. The thun|derings

of Hermon are the whi&s;perings of his voice; the ru&s;tling of his attire cau&s;eth lightning and an earthquake; and with the &s;hadow of his garment he blot|teth out the &s;un.</P>
<P>GOD ALONE IS MERCIFUL. When he forged his immutable decrees on the anvil of eternal wi&s;dom, he tempered the mi&s;eries of the race of I&s;mael in the foun|tains of pity. When he laid the founda|tions of the world he ca&s;t a look of be|nevolence into the aby&s;&s;es of futurity; and the adamantine pillars of eternal ju&s;|tice were &s;oftened by the beamings of his eyes. He dropt a tear upon the embryo mi&s;eries of unborn man; and that tear, falling through the immea&s;urable lap&s;es of time, &s;hall quench the glowing flames of the bottomle&s;s pit. He &s;ent his prophet into the world to enlighten the darkne&s;s of the tribes; and hath prepared the pa|vilions of the Houri for the repo&s;e of the true believers.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="032945_0385_0FF5EC672AC0DAD0">
GOD ALONE IS JUST. He chains the latent cau&s;e to the di&s;tant event; and binds them both immutably fa&s;t to the fitne&s;s of things. He decreed the unbe|liever to wander amid&s;t the whirlwinds of errour; and &s;uited his &s;oul to future tor|ment. He promulgated the ineffable creed, and the germs of countle&s;s &s;ouls of believ|ers, which exi&s;ted in the contemplation of Deity, expanded at the &s;ound. His ju&s;tice refre&s;heth the faithful, while the damned &s;pirits confe&s;s it in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>GOD ALONE IS ONE. Ibraham the faithful knew it. Mo&s;es declared it a|mid&s;t the thunderings of Sinai. Je&s;us pronounced; it and the me&s;&s;enger of God, the &s;word of his vengeance, filled the world with immutable truth.</P>

The wealth, which would render a &s;ub|ject too powerful, the de&s;pot can tru&s;t with an unambitious Jew; and confide &s;ecrets, which involve his own &s;afety to a mi&s;erable I&s;raelite. whom he can annihi|late with a nod.

Popular prejudice is generally again&s;t them; and the Dey of|ten avails him&s;elf of it by heavy amerce|ments for his protection. In the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ninety, he threatened to extirpate the whole race in his dominions, and was final|ly appea&s;ed by a large contribution they rai&s;ed and offered as an expiation of a &s;uppo&s;ed offence. It was commonly reported, that the Jews in Algiers, at that time, had procured a chri&s;tian child, which they privately purified with much ceremony, fattened and prepared for a &s;ac|rifice, at their fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over, as a &s;ub&s;titute for the pa&s;chal lamb.

<P>RETURNING from a jaunt into the city, I was immediately com|manded to retire to my room, and not to quit it, till further orders, which it was impracticable to do, as the doors were fa&s;|tened upon me. The next morning my provi&s;ions were brought me, and the doors again carefully &s;ecured. Surpri&s;ed at this impri&s;onment, I pa&s;&s;ed many re&s;t|le&s;s hours in recurring to my pa&s;t con|duct, and perplexing my&s;elf in &s;earching for &s;ome inadvertent offence, or in dread|ful apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t the pre&s;ent impri&s;|onment &s;hould be a prelude to future and

more &s;evere puni&s;hment. The &s;tone quar|ry came to my imagination in all its hor|rours, and the frowns of Abdel Melic again pierced my &s;oul. I attempted in vain to obtain from the &s;lave, who brought me provi&s;ions, the cau&s;e of my confinement. He was probably ignorant; my &s;olici|tations were uniformly an&s;wered by a melancholy &s;hake of the head. The next day, the director of the ho&s;pital ap|peared. To him I applied with great earne&s;tne&s;s; but all the information he would give was, that it was by the Dey's order I was confined; and that he, with the phy&s;icians and my friend the Mollah were u&s;ing all their influence to obtain my relea&s;e. He coun&s;elled me to amu&s;e my&s;elf in preparing and compound|ing drugs, and promi&s;ed to &s;ee me again, as &s;oon as he could bring any good news. About a week after, an officer of the court, with a city judge, entered my apartment, and informed me of the cau&s;e of my im|pri&s;onment.
<PB N="186" REF="032945_0395_0FF5EC7224AFB940">
From them I learned, that &s;everal American ve&s;&s;els had been cap|tured; and, it was &s;u&s;pected, I had been conver&s;ing with my countrymen; and, from my &s;uperiour knowledge of the coun|try, I might advi&s;e them how to e&s;cape. If a man is de&s;irous to know how he loves his country, let him go far from home; if to know how he loves his countrymen, let him be with them in mi&s;ery in a &s;trange land. I wi&s;h not to make a vain di&s;play of my patrioti&s;m, but I will &s;ay, that my own mi&s;fortunes, upon this intelligence, were &s;o ab&s;orbed in tho&s;e of my unfortunate fel|low citizens, thus delivered over to chains and torment, many of them perhaps &s;ep|arated from the tendere&s;t dome&s;tic con|nexions and homes of ca&s;e, that, I thought, I could again have willingly en|dured the la&s;hes of the &s;lave driver, and &s;ink my&s;elf beneath the burthens of &s;lave|ry, to have &s;aved them from an Algerine captivity. I could readily a&s;&s;ure the
<PB N="187" REF="032945_0396_0FF5ECA9D2D18140">
Dey's officers, that I had not conver&s;ed with my mi&s;erable countrymen; but, while I &s;pake, the idea of embracing a fellow citizen, a brother chri&s;tian, per|haps &s;ome one, who came from the &s;ame &s;tate, or had been in the &s;ame town, or &s;een my dear parents, pa&s;&s;ed in rapid &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and I was determined, betide what would, to &s;eek them the fir&s;t opportunity. We were &s;oon joined by the Mollah, who repeatedly a&s;&s;ured my examiners, that, though an infidel, I might be believed. By his &s;olicitation, I was to be relea&s;ed; but not until I would bind my&s;elf by a &s;olemn oath, admini&s;tered after the chri&s;|tian manner, that I would never &s;peak to any of the American &s;laves. When this oath was propo&s;ed, I doubted whether to take it; but, recollecting that, if I did not, I &s;hould be equally debarred from &s;eeing them, and &s;uffer a grievous con|finement, which could do them no &s;er|vice, I con&s;ented and bound my&s;elf never

directly or indirectly to attempt to vi&s;it or conver&s;e with my fellow citizens in &s;la|very. It was, at the &s;ame time, intimat|ed to me, that for the breach of this oath I might expect to be impaled alive.&mdash;Often, when I have drawn near the places of their confinement and labours, I have regretted my &s;ubmitting to this oath, and once was almo&s;t tempted to break it, at &s;eeing Captain O'Brien at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>

<P>AFTER I had taken this oath, the officers departed, and I was liberated. I was now more cautious in my rambles, avoided the notice of the Mu&s;&s;ulmen in|habitants, and made more frequent vi&s;|its to that part of the city, inhabited by Jews and foreigners. Refre&s;hing my&s;elf with a gla&s;s of &s;herbet in an inferiour room, I was acco&s;ted by an old man, in mean attire, with a pack of handkerchiefs and &s;ome remnants of &s;ilk and mu&s;lins on his back. He a&s;ked me, if I was not the learned &s;lave, and reque&s;ted me to vi&s;it a &s;ick &s;on. I immediately re&s;olved
<PB N="190" REF="032945_0399_0FF5EC7672451460">
to go with him; rejoicing that Providence, in my low e&s;tate, had left me the power to be charitable. We traver&s;ed &s;everal &s;treets and &s;topped at the door of a hou&s;e, which, in appearance, well &s;uited my conductor. It had but two windows towards the &s;treet, and tho&s;e were clo&s;ed up with rough boards, the cracks of which were &s;tuffed with rags and &s;traw. My conductor looked very cautiou&s;ly about, and then, taking a key from his pocket, opened the door. We pa&s;&s;ed a dark en|try, and, I confe&s;s, I &s;huddered, as the door clo&s;ed upon me, reflecting that, per|haps, this man was employed to decoy me to &s;ome &s;ecret place, in order to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate me, by the direction of my &s;upe|riours, who might wi&s;h to de&s;troy me in this &s;ecret manner. But I had but little time for the&s;e gloomy reflections; for, opening another door, I was &s;tartled with a blaze of light, let into apartments &s;plen|didly furni&s;hed. My conductor now a&s;|&s;umed
<PB N="191" REF="032945_0400_0FF5ECAD952AAF98">
an air of importance, reque&s;ted me to repo&s;e my&s;elf on a &s;ilken couch, and retired. A young lady, who was veiled, of a graceful per&s;on and plea&s;ing addre&s;s, &s;oon brought a plate of &s;weet|meats and a bottle of excellent wine. The old man &s;oon reappeared; but, &s;o changed in his habit and appearance, I could &s;carce recognize him. He was now arrayed in drawers of the fine&s;t lin|en, an embroidered ve&s;t, and loo&s;e gown of the riche&s;t Per&s;ian &s;ilk. He &s;miled at my &s;urpri&s;e, &s;hook me by the hand, and told me that he was a Jew; a&s;&s;uring me, that he was with his brethren under the protection of the Dey. The outward appearance of his hou&s;e, and the mean|ne&s;s of his attire abroad were, he &s;aid, ne|ce&s;&s;ary to avoid envy and &s;u&s;picion. But come, &s;aid he, I know all about you; I can confide in you. Come refre&s;h your&s;elf with a gla&s;s of this wine;&mdash;nei|ther Mo&s;es nor your Me&s;&s;iah forbid the
<PB N="192" REF="032945_0401_0FF5EC78C5095650">
u&s;e of it. We ate of the collation, drank our wine liberally; and then he in|troduced me to his &s;on, whom I found labouring under a violent ague. I ad|mini&s;tered &s;ome &s;udorifics, and left direc|tion for the future treatment of my pa|tient. Upon my departure, the Jew put a zequin into my hand, and made me promi&s;e to vi&s;it his &s;on again; reque&s;t|ing me to &s;eat my&s;elf in the place, he had found me, at the &s;ame hour, the next day but one afterwards; and, in pa&s;&s;ing through the dark entry, conjured me not to mention his dome&s;tic &s;tyle of living. The name of this Jew was Adonah Ben Benjamin. I vi&s;ited his &s;on, according to appointment, and found him nearly re|&s;tored to health. The father and &s;on both expre&s;&s;ed great gratitude; but the former told me he would not pay me for this vi&s;it in &s;ilver or gold, but with &s;ome|thing more valuable, by his advice. Come and &s;ee me &s;ometimes; I know
<PB N="193" REF="032945_0402_0FF5ECB02F1A4DC8">
this people well, and may render you more &s;ervice than you expect. I after|wards vi&s;ited this Jew frequently, and from him obtained much information. He told me, in much confidence, that &s;oon after I was taken, a Jew and two Algerines made a tour of the United States, and &s;ent home an accurate account of the American commerce; and that the Dey was &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with the idea of our wealth, that he would never permit the American &s;laves to be ran&s;omed under a large premium, which mu&s;t be accom|panied with the u&s;ual pre&s;ents, as a pur|cha&s;e of peace, and an annual tribute. Expre&s;&s;ing my anxiety to recover my freedom, he advi&s;ed me to write to &s;ome of the American agents in Europe. I accordingly addre&s;&s;ed a letter to William Carmichael, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> charge des affairs from the United States at the court of Mad|rid, repre&s;enting my deplorable circum|&s;tances, and the mi&s;erable e&s;tate of my
<PB N="194" REF="032945_0403_0FF5EC7AF256EEB0">
fellow pri&s;oners; praying the inter|ference of our government, &s;tating the probable mode of acce&s;s to the Dey, and enclo&s;ing a letter to my parents. This my friend, the Jew, promi&s;ed to convey; but, as I never received any an&s;wer from Mr. Carmichael, and my letters never found the way to my friends, I conclude, from the known humanity of that gen|tleman, my letters mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>Some time after, I heard that the Unit|ed States had made application, through Mr. I amb, for the redemption of their citizens, and I had hopes of liberty; in|tending, if that gentleman &s;ucceeded in his negotiations, to claim my right to be ran&s;omed, as an American citizen, but his propo&s;als were &s;couted with con|tempt. I have &s;ometimes heard this gentleman cen&s;ured for failing to accom|pli&s;h the object of his mi&s;&s;ion, but very unju&s;tly; as I well remember that I, who was much intere&s;ted in his &s;ucce&s;s, never
<PB N="195" REF="032945_0404_0FF5ECB25FAA6260">
blamed him at the time; and, I know, the ran&s;om, he offered the Dey, was rid|iculed in the common coffee hou&s;es, as extremely pitiful. The few Algerines, I conver&s;ed with, affected to repre&s;ent it as in&s;ulting. It was reported, that he was empowered to offer only two hun|dred dollars per head for each pri&s;oner indi&s;criminately, when the common price was four thou&s;and dollars per head for a captain of a ve&s;&s;el, and one thou&s;and four hundred for a common fore ma&s;t &s;ailor. When this un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt failed, the pri&s;oners were treated with greater &s;everity; doubtle&s;s with a de&s;ign to af|fright the Americans into terms, more advantageous to the Dey.</P>
<P>Finding my hopes of relea&s;e from the applications of my country to fade, I con&s;ulted the friendly Jew, who advi&s;ed me to endeavour to pay my own ran&s;om, which, he &s;aid, might be effected with my &s;avings from my practice by the media|tion
<PB N="196" REF="032945_0405_0FF5EC7DBB1A5348">
of a rich Jew, his relation. I ac|cordingly put all my &s;avings into Adonah Ben Benjamin's hands, which amounted to two hundred and eighty dollars, and re&s;olved to add to it all I could procure. To this intent I hoarded up all I could obtain; denying my&s;elf the &s;lender re|fre&s;hments of bathing and cooling liq|uors, to which I had been for &s;ome time accu&s;tomed. The benevolent Hebrew promi&s;ing that, when I had attained the &s;um requi&s;ite, within two or three hun|dred dollars, he him&s;elf would advance the remainder, no mi&s;er was ever more engaged than I to increa&s;e my &s;tore. After a tedious interval, my pro&s;pects brightened &s;urpri&s;ingly. Some fortunate operations, I performed, obtained me valuable pre&s;ents; one to the amount of fifty dollars. My &s;tock, in the Jew's hands, had increa&s;ed to nine hundred dollars; and, to add to my good fortune, the Jew told me, in great confidence, that,
<PB N="197" REF="032945_0406_0FF5ECB3E3AC4360">
from the plea&s;ing account of the United States, which I had given him, for I al|ways &s;pake of the privileges of my native land with fervour, he was determined to remove with his family thither. He &s;aid he would make up the deficiency in my ran&s;om, and &s;end me home by the fir&s;t European ve&s;&s;el, with letters to a Mr. Lopez, a Jew, who, he &s;aid, lived in Rhode I&s;land or Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, to whom he had a recommendation from a relation, who had been in America. To Mr. Lo|pez he intended to con&s;ign his property. He accordingly procured his friend, who&s;e name I did not then learn, to agree about my ran&s;om. He concluded the contract at two thou&s;and dollars. My friends in the ho&s;pital expre&s;&s;ed &s;orrow at parting with me; and making me &s;ome pecunia|ry pre&s;ents, I immediately added them to my &s;tock, in the hands of the Jew. In order to le&s;&s;en the price of my ran&s;om, the contractor had told my ma&s;ter that
<PB N="198" REF="032945_0407_0FF5EC7FF2590DA8">
he was to advance the money, and take my word to remit it, upon my return to my friends. This &s;tory I confirmed. I went to the Jew's hou&s;e, who hone&s;tly produced all my &s;avings; we counted them together, and he added the remain|der, tying the money up in two large bags, We &s;pent a happy hour, over a bottle of his be&s;t wine: I, in anticipating the plea&s;|ure my parents and friends, would receive in recovering their &s;on, who was lo&s;t, and the Jew in framing plans of commerce in the United States, and in the enjoyment of his riches in a country, where no de&s;|pot &s;hould force from him his hone&s;t gains; and, what added to my enjoyment, was the information that a ve&s;&s;el was to &s;ail for Gibraitar in two days, in which, he a&s;&s;ured me, he would procure me a pa&s;&s;age. I returned to the ho&s;pital, ex|ulting in my happy pro&s;pects. I was quite be&s;ide my&s;elf with joy. I capered and danced as merrily, as my youthful ac|quaintance
<PB N="199" REF="032945_0408_0FF5ECB5F97AD030">
at a hu&s;king. Sometimes I would be lo&s;t in thought, and then bur&s;t &s;uddenly into loud laughter. The next day towards evening, I ha&s;ted to the hou&s;e of my friend the Jew, to &s;ee if he had en|gaged my pa&s;&s;age, and to gratify my&s;elf with conver&s;ing upon my native land. Being intimate in the family, I was en|tru&s;ted with a key of the front door. I opened it ha&s;tily, and pa&s;&s;ing the entry, knocked for admittance at the inner door, which was &s;oon opened. But, in&s;tead of the accu&s;tomed &s;plendour, all was gloo|my; the windows darkened, and the fam|ily in tears. Poor Adonah Ben Benja|min had, that morning, been &s;truck with an apoplexy, and &s;lept with his fathers. I &s;oon retired as &s;incere a mourner as the neare&s;t kindred. I had indeed more rea|&s;on to mourn than I conceived; for, up|on applying to his &s;on for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in perfecting my freedom, which his good fa|ther had &s;o happily begun, he profe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="200" REF="032945_0409_0FF5ECDEEAFA3280">
the utmo&s;t ignorance of the whole tranf|action; declared that he did not know the name of the agent, his father had employ|ed, and gave no credit to my account of the monies I had lodged with his father. I de&s;cribed the bags. He cooly an&s;wer|ed, that the God of his father Abraham had ble&s;&s;ed his father Adonah with many &s;uch bags. I left him, di&s;tracted with my di&s;appointment. Sometimes I deter|mined to relate the whole &s;tory to the di|rector of the ho&s;pital, and apply for legal redre&s;s to a cadi; but the &s;pecimen I had of an Algerine law &s;uit deterred me. I had been &s;o inadvertent, as to counte|nance the &s;tory that a Jew was to advance the whole &s;um for me. If I had been a Mu&s;&s;ulman, I might have atte&s;ted to my &s;tory; but a &s;lave is never admitted as an evidence in Algiers, the We&s;t Indies, or the Southern States. The di&s;appoint|ment of my hopes were &s;oon known in the ho&s;pital, though the hand Adonah
<PB N="201" REF="032945_0410_0FF5ECDB30DDA4C0">
Ben Benjamin had in the contract re|mained a &s;ecret. The artful Jew, who had contracted for my ran&s;om, fearing he &s;hould have to advance the money him|&s;elf, &s;pread a report that I was immen&s;ely rich in my own country. This coming to the ears of my ma&s;ter, he rai&s;ed my ran&s;om to &s;ix thou&s;and dollars, which the wily I&s;raelite declining to pay, the con|tract was di&s;&s;olved. From my ma&s;ter I learned his name, and waited upon him, hoping to obtain &s;ome evidence of Ado|nah's having received my money, at lea&s;t &s;o far as to induce his &s;on to re&s;tore it. But the Jew po&s;itively declared that Adonah never told him other, than that he was to advance the ca&s;h him&s;elf. Thus, from the brighte&s;t hopes of freedom, I was re|duced to de&s;pair; my money lo&s;t; and my ran&s;om rai&s;ed. I ble&s;s a merciful God that I was pre&s;erved from the de&s;|perate folly of &s;uicide. I never attempt|ed my life; but, when I lay down, I oft|en

hoped that I might never awake again, in this world of mi&s;ery. I grew dejected and my fle&s;h wa&s;ted. The phy&s;icians recommended a journey into the country, which my ma&s;ter approved; for, &s;ince the report of my wealth in my native land, he viewed my life as valuable to him, as he doubted not my friends would one day ran&s;om me at an exorbitant premium.</P>

He pre&s;&s;ed my hand at parting, gave me ma|ny &s;alutary cautions, as to my conduct during the voyage; and &s;aid, while the tears &s;tarted in his eyes, my friend, you have &s;uffered much misfortune and mi&s;|ery in a &s;hort life; let me conjure you not to add the torments of the future to the mi&s;eries of the pre&s;ent world. But, added he, pau&s;ing, who &s;hall alter the de|crees

of God? I flatter my&s;elf, that the &s;cales of natal prejudice will yet fall from your eyes, and that your name was numbered among the faithful from all eternity.</P>
<P>Our company con&s;i&s;ted of two Alge|rine merchants, or factors, twenty pilgrims, nine Jews, among whom was the &s;on of my decea&s;ed friend Adonah, and two Greek traders from Chios, who carried with them &s;everal bales of &s;ilks and a quantity of ma&s;tic, to vend at Scanda|roon, Grand Cairo and Medina. We took pa&s;&s;age in a Xebec; and, coa&s;t|ing the African &s;hore, &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed the ru|ins of antient Carthage, the Bay of Tu|nis; and, weathering cape Bona, and &s;teering &s;outh ea&s;terly, one morning hove in &s;ight of the I&s;land of Malta, inhabited by the knights of that name, who are &s;worn enemies of the Mahometan faith. I could perceive, that the &s;ight of this i&s;land gave a &s;en&s;ible alarm to the crew
<PB N="206" REF="032945_0415_0FF5ECE5E0AE1E90">
and pa&s;&s;engers. But the captain, or rather &s;kipper, who was a blu&s;tering, rough renegado, affected great courage and &s;wore that, if he had but one can|non on board, he would run down and give a broad &s;ide to the infidel dogs. His bravery was &s;oon put to the te&s;t; for, as the &s;un aro&s;e, we could di&s;cern plainly an armed ve&s;&s;el bearing down upon us. She overhauled us fa&s;t, and our &s;kipper conjectured &s;he bore the Malte&s;e colours. All hands were now &s;ummoned to get out &s;ome light &s;ails, and &s;everal oars were put out, at which the brave &s;kipper tugged as lu&s;tily as the meane&s;t of us. When the wind lulled and we gained of the ve&s;|&s;el, he would run upon the quarters of the Xebec, and hollow; "Come on, you chri&s;tian dogs, I am ready for you," I have &s;ome doubts, whether the ve&s;&s;el ever noticed us. If &s;he did, &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed us; for &s;he tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outh we&s;t. This was no &s;ooner perceived by
<PB N="207" REF="032945_0416_0FF5ECB8D21E4288">
our gallant commander, than he ordered the Xebec to lay too, and &s;wore, that he would pur&s;ue the uncircumci&s;ed dogs, and board them; but he fir&s;t would pru|dently a&s;k the approbation of the pa&s;&s;en|gers, who in&s;tantly determined one and all that their bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;uch, that they mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon the captain's making his be&s;t way to port. The captain con&s;ent|ed, but not without much grumbling at his misfortune, in lo&s;ing &s;o fine a prize; and declared that, when he landed his pa&s;&s;engers, he would directly quit the port and renew the cha&s;e. After a &s;mart run, we dropt anchor in the port of Alex|andria, called by the Turks Scandaroon. This is the &s;ite of the antient Alex|andria, founded by Alexander the great; though its pre&s;ent appearance would not induce an opinion of &s;o magnificent a founder. It lies not far from the we&s;ter|mo&s;t branch of the river Nile, by which, in ancient day, it was &s;upplied with wa|ter.
<PB N="208" REF="032945_0417_0FF5ECE766108D78">
The antiquarian eye may po&s;&s;ibly ob&s;erve, in the &s;cattered fragments of rocks, the ve&s;tiges of the ruins of its an|tient grandeur; but a vulgar traveller, from the appearance of the harbour, chok|ed with &s;and, the mi&s;erable buildings, and more wretched inhabitants of the town, would not be led to conclude that this was the port, which ro&s;e triumphant on the ruins of Tyre and Carthage. We here hired camels; and, being joined by a number of pilgrims and traders, collect|ed from various parts of the Levant, we proceeded towards Grand Cairo, the pre&s;|ent capital of Egypt; and, after travel|ling three days, or rather three nights, for we generally repo&s;ed in the heat of the day, which is &s;evere from one hour after the &s;un's ri&s;ing until it &s;ets, we came to a pretty town on the we&s;t bank of the Nile, called Gize, and hence pa&s;&s;ed over on rafts to the city of Grand Cairo, called by the Turks Almizer; the &s;uburbs of which
<PB N="209" REF="032945_0418_0FF5ECBAE7C97C60">
extend to the river, but the principal town commences its proper boundaries, at about three miles ea&s;t of the Nile. I was now within a comparatively &s;hort di&s;tance of two magnificent curio&s;ities, I had ever been de&s;irous of beholding. The city of Jeru&s;alem was only about five day's journey to the &s;outh ea&s;t, and I had even caught a glimp&s;e of the pyra|mids near Gize. I went with my ma&s;|ters and others to &s;ee a deep &s;toned pit, in the ca&s;tle, called Jo&s;eph's well; and &s;aid to have been dug by the direction of that patriarch. I am not antiquarian enough to know the particular &s;tyle of Jo&s;eph's well archite|cture; but the water was &s;weet and extremely cold. The Turks &s;ay that Potiphar's wife did not cea&s;e to per&s;ecute Jo&s;eph with her love, after he was relea&s;ed from pri&s;on, and advanced to power; but the patriarch, being warned by a dream to dig this well, and invite her to drink of the water, which &s;he had no

&s;ooner done, but one cup of it &s;o effectu|ally cooled her de&s;ires, that &s;he was ever afterwards an eminent example of the mo&s;t frigid cha&s;tity. In Grand Cairo, we were joined by many pilgrims from Pale&s;tine, and the adjacent countries. The third day, our carivan, which con|&s;i&s;ted of three hundred camels and drom|edaries, &s;et out for Medina, under the convoy of a troop of Mamaleuk's guards, a tawny, raw boned, ill clothed people. Some of the merchants, and even pilgrims made a hand&s;ome appearance in per&s;on, dre&s;s, and equipage. I was my&s;elf well mounted upon a camel, and carried with me only my leather wallet of drugs, which I di&s;pen&s;ed freely among the pilgrims; my ma&s;ters receiving the ordinary pay, while I collected many &s;mall &s;ums, which the gratitude of my patients added to the u&s;ual fee. We pa&s;&s;ed near the north arm of the red &s;ea, and then pur&s;ued our journey &s;outh, until we &s;truck the &s;ame
<PB N="211" REF="032945_0420_0FF5ECBC6DB4D9F8">
arm again, near the place where the learned Wortley Montague has con|cluded the I&s;raelites, under the conduct of Mo&s;es, effected their pa&s;&s;age. The breadth of the &s;ea here is great, and the waters deep and turbulent. The infidel may &s;neer, if he choo&s;es; but, for my own part, I am convinced beyond a doubt, that, if the I&s;raelites pa&s;&s;ed in this place, it mu&s;t have been by the miraculous in|terpo&s;ition of a divine power. I could not refrain from reflecting upon the in|fatuated temerity, which impelled the E|gygtian king to follow them. Well does the Latin poet exclaim; <HI>Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.</HI> We then travelled ea&s;t, until we came to a &s;mall village, called Tadah. Here we filled many goat &s;kins with water, and laded our camels with them. In addition to my wallet, I received two goat &s;kins or bags of water upon my camel. The weight, this u&s;eful animal will carry, is

a&s;toni&s;hing; and the facility and promp|titude, with which he kneels to receive his rider and burthen, &s;urpri&s;ing. We now entered the confines of Arabia Petrea, very aptly denominated the rocky Ara|bia; for, journeying &s;outh ea&s;t, we pa&s;&s;ed over many ridges of mountains, which appeared of &s;olid rocks, while the vallies and plains between them were almo&s;t a quick&s;and. Not a tree, &s;hrub, or vegeta|ble is to be &s;een. In the&s;e vallies, the &s;un poured intolerable day, and its re|flections from the land were in&s;upport|able. No refre&s;hing breeze is here felt. The intelligent traveller often fears the ri&s;ing of the wind, which blows &s;uch &s;ultry gales, that man and bea&s;t oft|en &s;ink beneath them, "never to ri&s;e again" or, when agitated into a tempe&s;t drive the &s;and with &s;uch tumultuous vio|lence, as to overwhelm whole caravans. Such indeed were the &s;tories told me, as I pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e dreary plains. The only
<PB N="213" REF="032945_0422_0FF5ECBE8A9EE328">
inconvenience, I &s;u&s;tained, aro&s;e from the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un, and the chills of the night, which our thin garments were not calculated to exclude. On the third day, after we left Tadah, the water, which we tran&s;ported on our camels, was nearly expended. The&s;e extraordinary animals had not drank but once, &s;ince our departure. Near the middle of the fourth day, I ob&s;erved our camels &s;nuff the air, and &s;oon &s;et off in a bri&s;k trot, and ju&s;t before night brought us to wa|ter. This was contained in only one deep well, dug, like a rever&s;ed pyramid, with &s;teps, to de&s;cend on every &s;ide, to the depth of one hundred feet; yet the &s;agacity of the camel had di&s;covered this water at perhaps twenty miles di&s;tance. So my fellow travellers a&s;&s;erted; but I have &s;ince thought, whether the&s;e camels, from frequently pa&s;&s;ing this de&s;ert coun|try, did not di&s;cover their approach to water, rather from the eye, noting familiar
<PB N="214" REF="032945_0423_0FF5ECEE546F3380">
objects, than the actual &s;centing the water it&s;elf. A hor&s;e that has journeyed the whole day, will quicken his &s;tep at night, when, upon a familiar road, within &s;ome miles of an accu&s;tomed &s;table. Our e&s;|cort delighted in the marvellous. Many a dreadful &s;tory did they tell of poi&s;|onous winds and overwhelming &s;ands; and of the fierce wandering Arabs, who captured whole caravans, and eat their pri&s;oners. Many a bloody battle had they fought with this cruel banditti, in which, according to their narratives, they always came off conquerours. Fre|quently were we alarmed, to be in read|ine&s;s to combat their &s;avage free booters; though I never &s;aw but two of the wild Arabs, in the whole of our journey. They joined us at a little village, ea&s;t of I&s;lamboul, and acco&s;ted us with great ci|vility. They were dre&s;&s;ed in blue frocks, girded round the wa&s;te with particolour|ed &s;a&s;hes, in which were &s;tuck a pi&s;tol
<PB N="215" REF="032945_0424_0FF5ECC1548D3718">
and a long knife. Their legs were bare, and &s;heep&s;kin caps covered their heads. Their complexions were &s;allow, but their garments and per&s;ons were clean. In|deed, their dre&s;s and addre&s;s evinced them to be of a more civilized race than our guards, who affected to treat them with lofty hauteur; and, when they departed, a&s;&s;ured us that they were &s;pies, and that an attack from their countrymen might now be apprehended with certainly; if, &s;aid the leader of our e&s;cort, they are not ter|rified by finding you under our protec|tion.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN we were within one day's journey of Medina, we halted for a longer time than u&s;ual; occa&s;ioned, as I found, by the arrival of a mo&s;t holy &s;aint. As I had never &s;een a &s;aint, be|ing bred, in a land, where even the re|lics of the&s;e holy men are not pre&s;erved, for I believe all New England cannot produce &s;o much as a &s;aint's rotten tooth or toe nail, I was &s;olicitous to &s;ee and conver&s;e with this ble&s;&s;ed per&s;onage. I &s;oon di&s;covered him, in the mid&s;t of a|bout fifty pilgrims, &s;ome of whom were devoutly touching their foreheads with
<PB N="217" REF="032945_0426_0FF5ECC2D9602F70">
the hem of his garment, while others, &s;till more devout, pro&s;trated them&s;elves on the ground, and ki&s;&s;ed the prints of his foot&s;teps in the &s;and. Though I was a&s;|&s;ured, that he was filled with divine love, and conferred felicity on all, who touched him; yet, to outward appearance, he was the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting, contemptible object, I had ever &s;een. Figure to your&s;elves, my readers, a little decrepit, old man, made &s;horter by &s;tooping, with a counte|nance, which exhibited a vacant &s;tare, his head bald, his finger and toe nails as long as hawks' claws, his attire &s;qualid, his face, neck, arms, and legs begrimed with dirt and &s;warming with vermin, and you will have &s;ome faint idea of this Mu&s;&s;ulman &s;aint. As I was too rea&s;onable to expect that holine&s;s exi&s;ted in a man's exteriour, I waited to hear him &s;peak; anticipating, from his lips, the profounde&s;t wi&s;dom, delivered in the honied accents of the &s;aints in bli&s;s. At length he &s;pake; and
<PB N="218" REF="032945_0427_0FF5ECF1FA696268">
his &s;peech betrayed him, a mere idiot. While this a&s;toni&s;hed me, it rai&s;ed the re&s;pect of his admirers, who e&s;timated his &s;anctity in an inver&s;e ratio to the weak|ne&s;s of his intellects. If they could have a&s;certained, that he was born an idiot, I verily believe, they would have adored him; for the Mahometans are taught by their alcoran, that the &s;ouls of &s;aints are often lodged in the bodies of idiots; and the&s;e pious &s;ouls, being &s;o intent on the joys of paradi&s;e, is the true rea&s;on, that the actions of their bodies are &s;o little &s;uited to the manners of this world. This &s;aint however did not a&s;pire to the &s;anctity of a genuine idiot; though, I fancy, his mode&s;ty injured his prefer|ment, for he certainly had very fair pre|ten&s;ions. It was re&s;olved, that the holy man &s;hould go with us; and, to my great mortification and di&s;gu&s;t, he was mount|ed behind me on the &s;ame camel; my Mahometan friends probably conceiving,
<PB N="219" REF="032945_0428_0FF5ECC50EABA550">
that he would &s;o far communicate his &s;anctity by contact, as that it might affect my conver&s;ion to their faith. Whatever were their motives, in the embraces of this naus&s;eous being, with the people pro&s;trat|ing them&s;elves in reverence on each &s;ide, I made my entry into the city of Medina.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MEDINA Tadlardh, errone|ou&s;ly called Medina Talmabi, is &s;ituated in Arabia De&s;erta, about forty five miles ea&s;t from the borders of the red &s;ea. To this place, as has been before related, the prophet &s;led, when driven from Mecca his birth place; and here he was buried, and his remains &s;till are pre&s;erved, in a &s;ilver cu&s;&s;in, ornamented with a golden cre&s;cent, enriched with jewels, covered with cloth of gold, &s;upported upon &s;ilver ta&s;&s;els, and &s;hadowed by a canopy, embroidered with
<PB N="221" REF="032945_0430_0FF5ECC740DF82C0">
&s;ilk and gold thread upon &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue. This canopy is renewed annually, by the ba&s;haw of Egypt; though other ba&s;haws, and great men among the Turks, often a&s;&s;i&s;t in the expen&s;e, or augment the value of the yearly pre&s;ent, by &s;ilver lamps and other ornaments. The whole are con|tained in a magnificent mo&s;que, in which are &s;u&s;pended innumerable gold and &s;il|ver lamps, &s;ome of which are kept contin|ually burning, and all are lighted on cer|tain public occa&s;ions; and even upon the approach of &s;ome dignified pilgrim. I had not acquired &s;ufficient holine&s;s, from my ble&s;&s;ed companion, to be permitted to enter this &s;anctified building. The Ara|bians are profu&s;ely extravagant, in the ti|tles they be&s;tow on the city of Medina; calling it the mo&s;t holy, mo&s;t renowned, mo&s;t excellent city; the &s;anctuary of the ble&s;&s;ed fugitive; model of the refulgent city in the cele&s;tial paradi&s;e; and &s;ome of the great vulgar &s;uppo&s;e, that when
<PB N="222" REF="032945_0431_0FF5ECF6D23D4408">
the world &s;hall be de&s;troyed, this city, with the prophet's remains, will be tran&s;|ported by angels, with all its inhabitants, to paradi&s;e. We tarried there but a few hours, as the great object of the devotions of the pilgrims was Mecca. Pilgrim|ages are performed to both places; but tho&s;e to Medina are not indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; being directed by the book of the companions of the apo&s;tles, while tho&s;e to Mecca are enjoined by the alco|ran it&s;elf. The former are &s;uppo&s;ed meritorious, the latter nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion. I had the curio&s;ity to inquire re|&s;pecting the prophet's co&s;&s;in being &s;u&s;|pended in the air by a load &s;tone, and was a&s;&s;ured that this was a mere chri&s;tian obloquy, as no preten&s;ions of any &s;uch &s;u&s;pen&s;ion were ever made.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEING freed from my ble&s;&s;ed companion, I had an agreeable journey from Medina to Mecca, which is the mo&s;t antient city in all Arabia; &s;ituated about two hundred miles &s;outh ea&s;t of Medina, twenty one degrees and forty five minutes north latitude, and one hundred and &s;ixteen degrees ea&s;t longitude, from Philadelphia, according to late American calculations. I &s;aw the great mo&s;que in the centre of Mec|ca, which it is &s;aid, far &s;urpa&s;&s;es in grandeur that of Sancta Sophia in Con&s;tantinople. It certainly is a very augu&s;t building, the roof of which is refulgent; but even the
<PB N="224" REF="032945_0433_0FF5ECF85C5BC018">
inhabitants &s;miled at my credulity, when I ob&s;erved that I had read it was covered with plated gold. This mo&s;que contains within its limits the grand object of the Mu&s;&s;ulman's pilgrimage; the <HI>Al Kaaba,</HI> or hou&s;e of God, &s;aid to have been built by the hands of the patriarch Abraham; to confirm which the Arabian prie&s;ts &s;hew a black &s;tone, upon which they &s;ay Abraham laid his &s;on I&s;aac, when he had bound him in preparation for his intend|ed &s;acrifice. This &s;tone and building were great objects of veneration, before the mi&s;&s;ion of the prophet, and he artfully availed him&s;elf of this popular prejudice, in rendering the highe&s;t re&s;pect to the holy hou&s;e, in his life time, and enjoin|ing upon his followers, without di&s;tinc|tion among males, to vi&s;it it once in their lives. The advent of the prophet was &s;aid to be announced from the four cor|ners of the hou&s;e, which exhibit the four cardinal points. Few pilgrims are per|mitted
<PB N="225" REF="032945_0434_0FF5ECCC3A9350C8">
to enter this &s;acred, venerable building; but, after travelling, &s;ome of them perhaps a thou&s;and miles, they are content to pro&s;trate them&s;elves in the courts, which &s;urround it. Few Mahom|etans perform this pilgrimage in per&s;on; tho&s;e who do are highly re&s;pected. This pilgrimage was enjoined, by the prophet, to be performed in per&s;on; but, when he laid this injunction, it is not probable he anticipated the exten&s;ive &s;pread of his doctrines. So long as his di&s;ciples were limited by the boundaries of Arabia, or had only extended them|&s;elves over a part of Syria, this pious journey was practicable and ea&s;y; but, when the cre&s;cent ro&s;e triumphant on the &s;ea coa&s;t, and mo&s;t of the interiour of Af|rica, when it &s;hone with &s;plendour in Per&s;ia, Tartary, and Turkey, and even adorned the Moori&s;h minarit in Spain, actual pilgrimage was deemed impractica|ble; and the faithful were allowed to
<PB N="226" REF="032945_0435_0FF5ECF9E25448C8">
vi&s;it the Kaaba by deputy. The inge|nuity of more modern times has alleviated this religious burthen &s;till further, by al|lowing the deputy to &s;ub&s;titute other at|tornies under him. Thus for example: the pious Mu&s;&s;ulman in Belgrade will employ a friend at Con&s;tantinople, who will empower another friend at Scanda|roon to procure a confidential friend at Grand Cairo to go in the name of him at Belgrade, and perform his pilgrimage to Mecca. Certificates of the&s;e &s;everal &s;ub|&s;titutions are pre&s;erved, and the lazy Mu&s;&s;ulman hopes by this fine&s;&s;e to reap the rewards of the faithful in paradi&s;e.</P>

<P>The Author returns to Scandaroon: Finds Adonah's Son &s;ick: His Contrition: Is re&s;tored to Health.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER tarrying &s;ixteen days at Mecca, during which time my ma&s;ters fa&s;ted, prayed, performed their devotions at the Kaaba, and &s;old their merchandize, we retraced the &s;ame rout to Scandaroon. Here we found the &s;on of Adonah Ben Benjamin, who had been detained in this place by &s;ickne&s;s, &s;o weakened from a tedious &s;low fever that his life was de&s;pair|ed of. He expre&s;&s;ed great joy, at our re|turn,
<PB N="228" REF="032945_0437_0FF5ECFD2B88A740">
and begged my profe&s;&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance; a&s;&s;uring me, that he e&s;teemed his pre&s;ent di&s;order a judicial puni&s;hment from the God of his fathers, for the injury he had done me; candidly confe&s;&s;ing, that he knew of his father's having received my money, which he would re&s;tore upon our return to Algiers, if I would effect his re|covery. He prevailed upon my ma&s;ters that I &s;hould abide in the hou&s;e with him, during their ab&s;ence, as they were engaged upon a trading tour to a place called Ginge, upon the river Nile. I exerted all my &s;kill, both as a phy&s;i|cian and nur&s;e. Perhaps my atten|tion in the latter capacity, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his youth, was of more &s;ervice than my pre|&s;criptions. Be that as it may, he recov|ered rapidly, and in ten days was able to walk the &s;treets; but I could not help noticing with &s;orrow, that as his &s;trength increa&s;ed, his gratitude and promi&s;es to refund my money decrea&s;ed.</P>

<P>The Gratitude of a Jew.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ONE day, walking on the beach, the Jew looked me &s;teadily in the face; and, laying his hand upon my &s;houl|der, &s;aid I owe you my life, I owe you money, which you cannot oblige me to pay. You think, a Jew will always de|ceive in money matters. You are mi&s;tak|en. You &s;hall not wait for your pay in Algiers; I will pay you here in Alexan|dria. I owe you one thou&s;and dollars on my father's account. Now, what do you demand for re&s;toring me to health? Nothing replied I, overjoyed at his prob|ity; re&s;tore me my money, and you are welcome to my &s;ervices. This mu&s;t not
<PB N="230" REF="032945_0439_0FF5ECFF55843978">
be, &s;aid the &s;on of Adonah, I have done wickedly, but mean not only to pay you, but &s;ati&s;fy my own con&s;cience. I will allow you in addition to the one thou&s;and dollars, two thou&s;and more for your a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, as a phy&s;ician; and then will ad|vance three thou&s;and more, which I will take your word to repay me, when you are able. I was a&s;toni&s;hed. I &s;eized his hand and felt his pul&s;e, to di&s;cover if he was not delirious. His pul&s;e were regu|lar, and I knew his ability to perform his promi&s;e. We will meet here on the morrow, and I will pay you. I met him the next day, and he was not ready to make payment. I now began to doubt his promi&s;es, and blame my&s;elf for the de|lu&s;ions of hope. By his appointment I met him the third day, on a retired part of the beach, we&s;tward from the port. We now &s;aw a man approaching us. That man, &s;aid the Jew, will pay you. You well under&s;tand, my friend, that your
<PB N="231" REF="032945_0440_0FF5ECD2D94C6CD8">
ran&s;om is fixed at &s;ix thou&s;and dollars. Now, whoever gives you your liberty, really pays you that &s;um. I have engag|ed the per&s;on, who is approaching, and who is the ma&s;ter of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, to tran&s;port you to Gibraltar, whence you may find your way home. The man now joined us and confirmed the words of the Jew, for whom he profe&s;&s;ed a great friend|&s;hip. It was concluded, that I &s;hould come to that &s;pot immediately after dark, where I &s;hould find a &s;mall boat waiting to carry me on board the ve&s;&s;el. The ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el declaring, that he run a great ri&s;k, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting in my e&s;cape; but was willing to do it out of commi&s;era|tion for me, and friend&s;hip for the Jew; and reminded me, that I had better pack up all my property, and bring it with me. I ha&s;tened home with the Jew, and collect|ed all the property I could with propriety call my own; which con&s;i&s;ted of a few clothes, and to the amount of three hun|dred
<PB N="232" REF="032945_0441_0FF5ED00D9AE0538">
and twenty dollars in ca&s;h. As &s;oon as it was dark, the Jew accompanied me to the beach, and then took an affection|ate leave of me, pre&s;enting me with the value of ten dollars, as a loan, gravely re|marking, that now I owed him three thou|&s;and and ten dollars, which he hoped I would tran&s;port to him as &s;oon as I arriv|ed in America. The Jew quitted me, and I &s;oon di&s;covered the approach of the boat, which I &s;lept into with a light heart, congratulating my&s;elf, that I was a|gain A FREE MAN. The boat &s;oon row|ed along &s;ide of a ve&s;&s;el, that was laying to for us. I jumped on board, and was directly &s;eized by two men, who bound me and hurried me below deck; and, af|ter robbing me of all my property, left me in the dark to my own reflections. I had been &s;o long the &s;port of cruel fortune, that the&s;e were not &s;o &s;evere, as my &s;ym|pathi&s;ing readers may conjecture. Re|peated mi&s;fortunes blunt &s;en&s;ibility. I
<PB N="233" REF="032945_0442_0FF5ECD4F114E930">
perceived that I had been played a vil|lanous trick, and exchanged a tolerable &s;lavery, for one perhaps more in&s;upporta|ble; but &s;hould have been perfectly re|&s;igned to my fate, if the dread of being returned to Algiers and &s;uffering the dreadful puni&s;hment, already related, had not pre&s;ented it&s;elf. In the morning, I reque&s;ted to &s;ee the captain; and, by his orders, was brought upon deck; to my &s;urpri&s;e, it was not the &s;ame per&s;on who had decoyed me on board. I was con|founded. I intended to have expo&s;tu|lated; but could I tell a &s;tranger, a man, who appeared a Mu&s;&s;ulman by his garb, that I was a runaway &s;lave? While I was perplexing my&s;elf what to &s;ay, the man, who had decoyed me on board, appeared. He was a pa&s;&s;enger, and claimed me as his &s;lave, having purcha&s;ed me, as he &s;aid, for four hundred zequins of a Jew, my for|mer ma&s;ter, and meant to carry me with him to Tunis. I was now awakened to
<PB N="234" REF="032945_0443_0FF5ED02601A98F0">
all the horrours of my &s;ituation. I dar|ed not irritate my new ma&s;ter by contra|dictions, and acquie&s;ced in his &s;tory in dumb de&s;pair. On the eighth day, after we departed from Scandaroon, the ve&s;&s;el made cape Bona, and expected &s;oon to anchor in the port of Tunis. My ma&s;ter had a Portugue&s;e &s;lave on board, who &s;lept in the birth with me. He &s;poke a little broken Engli&s;h, having been for|merly a &s;ailor on board a ve&s;&s;el of that nation. He gave me the mo&s;t alarming apprehen&s;ions of the cruelty of our ma&s;|ter, but flattered me by &s;aying that the Tuni&s;e in general were more mild with their &s;laves than the Algerines, and allow|ed a freer intercour&s;e with the European merchants; and, by their interference, we might obtain our liberty. While my fellow &s;lave &s;lept, I lay agonizing with the dread of entering the port of Tunis. Often did I wi&s;h that &s;ome friendly rock or kindly leak would &s;ink me, and my
<PB N="235" REF="032945_0444_0FF5ECD674E30448">
mi&s;fortunes, in perpetual oblivion; and I was nigh being gratified in my de&s;pe|rate wi&s;hes; for, the &s;ame night, a tre|mendous &s;torm aro&s;e, and the gale &s;truck us with &s;uch violence, that our &s;ails were in&s;tantly flittered into rags. We could not &s;hew a yard of canva&s;s, and were o|bliged to &s;cud under bare poles. The night was exce&s;&s;ively dark; and, to in|crea&s;e our di&s;tre&s;s, our balla&s;t &s;hifted and we were obliged to cut away our ma&s;ts by the board, to &s;ave us from foundering. The ve&s;&s;el righted, but being &s;trong and light, and the hatchways being well &s;e|cured, our captain was only fearful of being driven on &s;ome chri&s;tian coa&s;t. The next night, the wind lulled; and the morning after, the &s;un aro&s;e clear, and we found our&s;elves off the coa&s;t of Sar|dinia, and within gun &s;hot of an armed ve&s;&s;el. She proved to be a Portugue&s;e frigate. To the confu&s;ion and di&s;may of our captain and pa&s;&s;enger, and to the great
<PB N="236" REF="032945_0445_0FF5ED05183816A8">
joy of my&s;elf and fellow &s;lave. The frig|ate hoi&s;ted her colours, manned her boats, and boarded us. No &s;ooner was his na|tional flag di&s;played, than the overjoyed Portugue&s;e ran below and liberated me from my fetters, hugged me in raptures, and hauling me upon deck, the fir&s;t man we met was our ma&s;ter, whom he &s;aluted with a kick, and then &s;pit in his face. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that this rever&s;e of fortune made me feel for the wretched Mu&s;&s;ul|man, who &s;tood quivering with apprehen|&s;ions of in&s;tant death; nor could I refrain from preventing the Portugue&s;e from a|venging him&s;elf for the cruelties, he had &s;uffered, under this barbarian. The boats &s;oon boarded us, and &s;ecured the cap|tain and crew, whom they treated with as much bitter contempt, as my fellow had exerci&s;ed toward our late ma&s;ter. This poor fellow &s;oon introduced me to his countrymen, with a brief account of my country and mi&s;fortunes.</P>

<P>THE Portugue&s;e officers treat|ed me with politene&s;s; and, when they were rifling the ve&s;&s;el, reque&s;ted me to &s;elect my property from the plunder. I was then &s;ent on board the frigate. The captain expre&s;&s;ed much joy, at being the means of my deliverance, and told me, that the Portugue&s;e had a &s;incere regard for the Americans; and that he had re|ceived expre&s;s orders to protect our com|merce from the Barbary cor&s;airs. The pri&s;oners were brought on board and confined below; and, after every thing valuable was taken from the prize, the &s;hip &s;tood for the &s;traits of Gibraltar,
<PB N="238" REF="032945_0447_0FF5ED07C6DF23D8">
leaving a boat to fire the Tuni&s;e ve&s;&s;el. I never received more civility than from the officers of this frigate. In compliment to them, I was obliged to throw my Ma|hometan dre&s;s over the &s;hip's &s;ide; for they furni&s;hed me with every nece&s;&s;ary, and many ornamental articles of Europe|an clothing. The &s;urgeon was particu|larly attentive. I lent him &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance among the &s;ick, his mate being unwell; and, among other pre&s;ents, he gave me a hand&s;ome pocket ca&s;e of &s;urgical in&s;tru|ments. After a plea&s;ant voyage, we an|chored in port Logos, in the &s;outhern extremity of Portugal. Here I received the agreeable intelligence, that the Unit|ed States were about commencing a trea|ty with the Dey of Algiers, by the agen|cy of Jo&s;eph Donald&s;on, jun. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which would liberate my unhappy fellow citi|zens, and &s;ecure the American commerce from future depredations. Without landing, I had the good fortune to ob|tain
<PB N="239" REF="032945_0448_0FF5C41FD64A5C20">
a pa&s;&s;age on board an Engli&s;h mer|chantman, bound for Bri&s;tol, Captain Jo&s;eph, Joceline, commander. We had a pro&s;perous voyage to the land's end; and, very fortunately for me, ju&s;t off the little i&s;le of Lundy, &s;pake with a brigan|tine, bound to Che&s;apeak Bay, Captain John Harris, commander. In thirty two days, we made Cape Charles, the north chop of the Che&s;apeak, and I pre|vailed upon the captain to &s;et me on &s;hore; and, on the third day of May, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety five, I landed in my native country, after an ab&s;ence of &s;even years and one month; about &s;ix years of which I had been a &s;lave. I purcha&s;ed a hor&s;e, and ha&s;tened home to my parents, who received me as one ri&s;en from the dead. I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe their emotions, or my own raptures. I had &s;uffered hunger, &s;ickne&s;s, fatigue, in&s;ult, &s;tripes, wounds, and every other cruel injury; and was
<PB N="240" REF="032945_0449_0FF5ED094C547A98">
now under the roof of the kinde&s;t and ten|dere&s;t of parents. I had been degraded to a &s;lave, and was now advanced to a citizen of the free&s;t country in the univer&s;e. I had been lo&s;t to my parents, friends, and country; and now found, in the em|braces and congratulations of the former, and the rights and protection of the latter, a rich compen&s;ation for all pa&s;t mi&s;eries. From &s;ome minutes I pre&s;erved, I com|piled the&s;e memoirs; and, by the &s;olici|tations of &s;ome re&s;pectable friends, have been induced to &s;ubmit them to the pub|lic. A long di&s;u&s;e of my native tongue, will apologize to the learned reader for any inaccuracies.</P>
<P>I now mean to unite my&s;elf to &s;ome a|miable woman, to pur&s;ue my practice, as a phy&s;ician; which, I hope, will be at|tended with more &s;ucce&s;s than when e&s;|&s;ayed with the inexperience and giddi|ne&s;s of youth. To contribute cheerfully to the &s;upport of our excellent govern|ment,
<PB N="241" REF="032945_0450_0FF5ECDD667922E8">
which I have learnt to adore, in &s;chools of de&s;poti&s;m; and thus &s;ecure to my&s;elf the enviable character of an u&s;eful phy&s;ician, a good father and worthy FEDERAL citizen.</P>
<P>My ardent wi&s;h is, that my fellow cit|izens may profit by my mi&s;fortunes. If they peru&s;e the&s;e pages with attention they will perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of uniting our federal &s;trength to inforce a due re&s;pect among other nations. Let us, one and all, endeavour to &s;u&s;tain the general gov|ernment. Let no foreign emi&s;&s;aries in|flame us again&s;t one nation, by raking in|to the a&s;hes of long extingui&s;hed enmity or delude us into the extravagant &s;chemes of another, by recurring to fancied grati|tude. Our fir&s;t object is union among our&s;elves. For to no nation be&s;ides the United States can that antient &s;aying be more emphatically applied; BY UNIT|ING WE STAND, BY DIVIDING WE FALL.</P>
