<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following account of the life of VENTURE, is a relation of &s;imple facts, in which nothing is added in &s;ub&s;tance to what he related him&s;elf. Many other intere&s;ting and curious pa&s;&s;ages of his life might have been in&s;erted; but on account of the bulk to which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;welled this narrative, they were omitted. If any &s;hould &s;u&s;pect the truth of what is here related, they are referred to people now living who are acquainted with mo&s;t of the facts men|tioned in the narrative.</P>
<P>The reader is here pre&s;ented with an account, not of a renowned politician or warrior, but of an untu|tored African &s;lave, brought into this Chri&s;tian country at eight years of age, wholly de&s;titute of all education but what he received in common with other dome&s;ti|cated animals, enjoying no advantages that could lead him to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf &s;uperior to the bea&s;ts, his fellow &s;ervants. And if he &s;hall derive no other advantage from peru&s;ing this narrative, he may experience tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations of &s;hame and indignation, that will prove him to be not wholly de&s;titute of every noble and ge|nerous feeling.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of the following pages, had he received only a common education, might have been a man of high re&s;pectability and u&s;efulne&s;s; and had his educa|tion been &s;uited to his genius, he might have been an ornament and an honor to human nature. It may per|haps, not be unplea&s;ing to &s;ee the efforts of a great mind wholly uncultivated, enfeebled and depre&s;&s;ed by &s;lavery, and &s;truggling under every di&s;advantage.&mdash;

The reader may here &s;ee a Franklin and a Wa&s;hington, in a &s;tate of nature, or rather in a &s;tate of &s;lavery. De&s;titute as he is of all education, and broken by hard|&s;hips and infirmities of age, he &s;till exhibits &s;triking traces of native ingenuity and good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>This narrative exhibits a pattern of hone&s;ty, pru|dence and indu&s;try, to people of his own colour, and perhaps &s;ome white people would not find them&s;elves degraded by imitating &s;uch an example.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Containing an account of his life, from his birth to the time of his leaving his native country.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born at Dukandarra, in Guinea, about the year 1729. My father's name was Saungm Furro, Prince of the Tribe of Dukandarra. My father had three wives. Polygamy was not uncommon in that country, e&s;pecially among the rich, as every man was allowed to keep as many wives as he could maintain. By his fir&s;t wife he had three children. The elde&s;t of them was my&s;elf, named by my father, Broteer. The other two were named Cundazo and Soozaduka. My father had two children by his &s;econd wife, and one by his third. I de&s;cended from a very large, tall and &s;tout race of beings, much larger than the generality of people in other parts of the globe, being commonly con&s;iderable above &s;ix feet in height, and every way well proportioned.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing worthy of notice which I remember was, a contention between my father and mother, on account of my father's marrying his third wife without the con&s;ent of his fir&s;t and elde&s;t, which was contrary to the cu&s;tom generally ob&s;erved among my country|men. In con&s;equence of this rupture, my mother left her hu&s;band and country, and travelled away with her three children to the ea&s;tward. I was then five years old. She took not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;tenance along with her, to &s;upport either her&s;elf or children. I was able to
<PB N="6" REF="034560_0005_0FFE29942E7BB050">
travel along by her &s;ide; the other two of her offspring &s;he carried one on her back, and the other being a &s;uck|ing child, in her arms. When we became hungry, my mother u&s;ed to &s;et us down on the ground, and gather &s;ome of the fruits which grew &s;pontaneou&s;ly in that climate. The&s;e &s;erved us for food on the way. At night we all lay down together in the mo&s;t &s;ecure place we could find, and repo&s;ed our&s;elves until morning. Though there were many noxious animals there; yet &s;o kind was our Almighty protector, that none of them were ever permitted to hurt or mole&s;t us. Thus we went on our journey until the &s;econd day after our departure from Dukandarra, when we came to the en|trance of a great de&s;ert. During our travel in that we were often affrighted with the doleful howlings and yel|lings of wolves, lions, and other animals. After five days travel we came to the end of this de&s;ert, and im|mediately entered into a beautiful and exten&s;ive inter|val country. Here my mother was plea&s;ed to &s;top and &s;eek a refuge for me. She left me at the hou&s;e of a very rich farmer. I was then, as I &s;hould judge, not le&s;s than one hundred and forty miles from my native place, &s;eparated from all my relations and acquaintance. At this place my mother took her farewel of me, and &s;et out for her own country. My new guardian, as I &s;hall call the man with whom I was left, put me into the bu&s;ine&s;s of tending &s;heep, immediately after I was left with him. The flock which I kept with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a boy, con&s;i&s;ted of about forty. We drove them every morning between two and three miles to pa&s;ture, into the wide and delightful plains. When night drew on, we drove them home and &s;ecured them in the cote. In this round I continued during my &s;tay there. One incident which befel me when I was driving my flock from pa&s;ture, was &s;o dreadful to me in that age, and is to this time &s;o fre&s;h in my memory, that I cannot help noticing it in this place. Two large dogs &s;allied out of
<PB N="7" REF="034560_0006_0FFE296815B26D98">
a certain hou&s;e and &s;et upon me. One of them took me by the arm, and the other by the thigh, and before their ma&s;ter could come and relieve me, they lacerated my fle&s;h to &s;uch a degree, that the &s;cars are very vi&s;ible to the pre&s;ent day. My ma&s;ter was immediately &s;ent for. He came and carried me home, as I was unable to go my&s;elf on account of my wounds. Nothing re|markable happened afterwards until my father &s;ent for me to return home.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this country, I mu&s;t ju&s;t inform my reader what I remember concerning this place. A large river runs through this country in a we&s;terly cour&s;e. The land for a great way on each &s;ide is flat and level, hedged in by a con&s;iderable ri&s;e of the country at a great di&s;tance from it. It &s;carce ever rains there, yet the land is fertile; great dews fall in the night which refre&s;h the &s;oil. About the latter end of June or fir&s;t of July, the river begins to ri&s;e, and gradually increa&s;es until it has inundated the country for a great di&s;tance, to the height of &s;even or eight feet. This brings on a &s;lime which enriches the land &s;urpri&s;ingly. When the river has &s;ub&s;ided, the natives begin to &s;ow and plant, and the vegetation is exceeding rapid. Near this rich river my guardian's land lay. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, I cannot exactly tell how much, yet this I am certain of re&s;pect|ing it, that he owned an immen&s;e tract. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed likewi&s;e a great many cattle and goats. During my &s;tay with him I was kindly u&s;ed, and with as much tender|ne&s;s, for what I &s;aw, as his only &s;on, although I was an entire &s;tranger to him, remote from friends and rela|tions. The principal occupations of the inhabitants there, were the cultivation of the &s;oil and the care of their flocks. They were a people pretty &s;imilar in every re&s;pect to that of mine, except in their per&s;ons, which were not &s;o tall and &s;tout. They appeared to be very kind and friendly. I will now return to my departure from that place.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034560_0007_0FFE2995B1739B60">My father &s;ent a man and hor&s;e after me. After &s;ettling with my guardian for keeping me, he took me away and went for home. It was then about one year &s;ince my mother brought me here. Nothing remark|able occured to us on our journey until we arrived &s;afe home.</P>
<P>I found then that the difference between my parents had been made up previous to their &s;ending for me. On my return, I was received both by my father and mo|ther with great joy and affection, and was once more re&s;tored to my paternal dwelling in peace and happine&s;s. I was then about &s;ix years old.</P>
<P>Not more than &s;ix weeks had pa&s;&s;ed after my return, before a me&s;&s;age was brought by an inhabitant of the place where I lived the preceding year to my father, that that place had been invaded by a numerous army, from a nation not far di&s;tant, furni&s;hed with mu&s;ical in&s;truments, and all kinds of arms then in u&s;e; that they were in&s;tigated by &s;ome white nation who equipped and &s;ent them to &s;ubdue and po&s;&s;e&s;s the country; that his nation had made no preparation for war, having been for a long time in profound peace that they could not defend them&s;elves again&s;t &s;uch a formidable train of in|vaders, and mu&s;t therefore nece&s;&s;arily evacuate their lands to the fierce enemy, and fly to the protection of &s;ome chief; and that if he would permit them they &s;hould come under his rule and protection when they had to retreat from their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. He was a kind and merciful prince, and therefore con&s;ented to the&s;e propo&s;als.</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely returned to his nation with the me&s;|&s;age, before the whole of his people were obliged to re|treat from their country, and come to my father's do|minions.</P>
<P>He gave them every privilege and all the protection his government could afford. But they had not been there longer than four days before news came to them
<PB N="9" REF="034560_0008_0FFE296997831AA0">
that the invaders had laid wa&s;te their country, and were coming &s;peedily to de&s;troy them in my father's territo|ries. This affrighted them, and therefore they imme|diately pu&s;hed off to the &s;outhward, into the unknown countries there, and were never more heard of.</P>
<P>Two days after their retreat, the report turned out to be but too true. A detachment from the enemy came to my father and informed him, that the whole army was encamped not far out of his dominions, and would invade the territory and deprive his people of their liberties and rights, if he did not comply with the following terms, The&s;e were to pay them a large &s;um of money, three hundred fat cattle, and a great num|ber of goats, &s;heep, a&s;&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P>My father told the me&s;&s;enger he would comply rather than that his &s;ubjects &s;hould be deprived of their rights and privileges, which he was not then in circum&s;tances to defend from &s;o &s;udden an inva&s;ion. Upon turning out tho&s;e articles, the enemy pledged their faith and honor that they would not attack him. On the&s;e he relied and therefore thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to be on his guard again&s;t the enemy. But their pledges of faith and honor proved no better than tho&s;e of other unprin|cipled ho&s;tile nations; for a few days after a certain relation of the king came and informed him, that the enemy who &s;ent terms of accommodation to him and re|ceived tribute to their &s;atisfaction, yet meditated an at|tack upon his &s;ubjects by &s;urpri&s;e, and that probably they would commence their attack in le&s;s than one day, and concluded with advi&s;ing him, as he was not pre|pared for war, to order a &s;peedy retreat of his family and &s;ubjects. He complied with this advice.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night which was fixed upon to retreat, my father and his family &s;et off about break of day. The king and his two younger wives went in one company, and my mother and her children in another. We left our dwellings in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and my father's company
<PB N="10" REF="034560_0009_0FFE2997344F4028">
went on fir&s;t. We directed our cour&s;e for a large &s;hrub plain, &s;ome di&s;tance off, where we intended to conceal our&s;elves from the approaching enemy, until we could refre&s;h and re&s;t our&s;elves a little. But we pre&s;ently found that our retreat was not &s;ecure. For having &s;truck up a little fire for the purpo&s;e of cooking victuals, the enemy who happened to be encamped a little di&s;tance off, had &s;ent out a &s;couting party who di&s;covered us by the &s;moke of the fire, ju&s;t as we were extingui&s;hing it, and about to eat. As &s;oon as we had fini&s;hed eating, my father di&s;covered the party, and immediately began to di&s;charge arrows at them. This was what I fir&s;t &s;aw, and it alarmed both me and the women, who being unable to make any re&s;i&s;tance, im|mediately betook our&s;elves to the tall thick reeds not far off, and left the old king to fight alone. For &s;ome time I beheld him from the reeds defending him&s;elf with great courage and firmne&s;s, till at la&s;t he was obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf into their hands.</P>
<P>They then came to us in the reeds, and the very fir&s;t &s;alute I had from them was a violent blow on the head with the fore part of a gun, and at the &s;ame time a gra&s;p round the neck. I then had a rope put about my neck, as had all the women in the thicket with me, and were immediately led to my father, who was likewi&s;e pinion|ed and haltered for leading. In this condition we were all led to the camp. The women and my&s;elf being pretty &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, had tolerable treatment from the ene|my, while my father was clo&s;ely interrogated re&s;pecting his money which they knew he mu&s;t have. But as he gave them no account of it, he was in&s;tantly cut and pounded on his body with great inhumanity, that he might be induced by the torture he &s;uffered to make the di&s;covery. All this availed not in the lea&s;t to make him give up his money, but he de&s;pi&s;ed all the tortures which they inflicted, until the continued exerci&s;e and increa&s;e of torment, obliged him to &s;ink and expire.
<PB N="11" REF="034560_0010_0FFE296B1B9C4C60">
He thus died without informing his enemies of the place where his money lay. I &s;aw him while he was thus tortured to death. The &s;hocking &s;cene is to this day fre&s;h in my mind, and I have often been overcome while thinking on it. He was a man of remarkable &s;tature. I &s;hould judge as much as &s;ix feet and &s;ix or &s;even inches high, two feet acro&s;s his &s;houlders, and every way well proportioned. He was a man of re|markable &s;trength and re&s;olution, affable, kind and gen|tle, ruling with equity and moderation.</P>
<P>The army of the enemy was large, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e con&s;i&s;ting or about &s;ix thou&s;and men. Their leader was called Baukurre. After de&s;troying the old prince, they decamped and immediately marched towards the &s;ea, lying to the we&s;t, taking with them my&s;elf and the wo|men pri&s;oners. In the march a &s;couting party was de|tached from the main army. To the leader of this party I was made waiter, having to carry his gun, &amp;c.&mdash; As we were a &s;couting we came acro&s;s a herd of fat cattle, con&s;i&s;ting of about thirty in number. The&s;e we &s;et upon, and immediately wre&s;ted from their keepers, and afterwards converted them into food for the army. The enemy had remarkable &s;ucce&s;s in de&s;troying the country wherever they went. For as far as they had penetrated, they laid the habitations wa&s;te and captur|ed the people. The di&s;tance they had now brought me was about four hundred miles. All the march I had very hard ta&s;ks impo&s;ed on me, which I mu&s;t perform on pain of puni&s;hment. I was obliged to carry on my head a large flat &s;tone u&s;ed for grinding our corn, weigh|ing as I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, as much as 25 pounds; be|&s;ides victuals, mat and cooking uten&s;ils. Though I was pretty large and &s;tout of my age, yet the&s;e burthens were very grievous to me, being only about &s;ix years and an half old.</P>
<P>We were then come to a place called Malaga&s;co.&mdash; When we entered the place we could not &s;ee the lea&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="034560_0011_0FFE299A2278A178">
appearance of either hou&s;es or inhabitants, but upon &s;tricter &s;earch found, that in&s;tead of hou&s;es above ground they had dens in the &s;ides of hillocks, contiguous to ponds and &s;treams of water. In the&s;e we perceived they had all hid them&s;elves, as I &s;uppo&s;e they u&s;ually did up|on &s;uch occa&s;ions. In order to compel them to &s;urren|der, the enemy contrived to &s;moke them out with fag|gots. The&s;e they put to the entrance of the caves and &s;et them on fire. While they were engaged in this bu|&s;ine&s;s, to their great &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome of them were de&s;|perately wounded with arrows which fell from above on them. This my&s;tery they &s;oon found out. They per|ceived that the enemy di&s;charged the&s;e arrows through holes on the top of the dens directly into the air.&mdash; Their weight brought them back, point downwards on their enemies heads, whil&s;t they were &s;moking the in|habitants out. The points of their arrows were poi|&s;oned, but their enemy had an antidote for it, which they in&s;tantly applied to the wounded part. The &s;moke at la&s;t obliged the people to give them&s;elves up. They came out of their caves, fir&s;t &s;patting the palms of their hands together, and immediately after extended their arms, cro&s;&s;ed at their wri&s;ts, ready to be bound and pinioned. I &s;hould judge that the dens above menti|oned were extended about eight feet horizontally into the earth, &s;ix feet in height and as many wide. They were arched over head and lined with earth, which was of the clay kind, and made the &s;urface of their walls firm and &s;mooth.</P>
<P>The invaders then pinioned the pri&s;oners of all ages and &s;exes indi&s;criminately, took their flocks and all their effects, and moved on their way towards the &s;ea. On the march the pri&s;oners were treated with clemency, on account of their being &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and humble. Having come to the next tribe, the enemy laid &s;iege and imme|diately took men, women, children, flocks, and all their valuable effects. They then went on to the next di&s;|trict
<PB N="13" REF="034560_0012_0FFE296E06320B58">
which was contiguous to the &s;ea, called in Africa, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. The enemies provi&s;ions were then almo&s;t &s;pent, as well as their &s;trength. The inhabitants know|ing what conduct they had pur&s;ued, and what were their pre&s;ent intentions, improved the favorable oppor|tunity, attacked them, and took enemy, pri&s;oners, &s;tocks and all their effects. I was then taken a &s;econd time. All of us were then put into the ca&s;tle, and kept for market. On a certain time I and other pri&s;oners were put on board a canoe, under our ma&s;ter, and rowed away to a ve&s;&s;el belonging to Rhode-I&s;land, com|manded by capt. Collingwood, and the mate Thomas Mumford. While we were going to the ve&s;&s;el, our ma&s;ter told us all to appear to the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible advan|tage for &s;ale. I was bought on board by one Robert|&s;on Mumford, &s;teward of &s;aid ve&s;&s;el, for four gallons of rum, and a piece of calico, and called VENTURE, on account of his having purcha&s;ed me with his own private venture. Thus I came by my name. All the &s;laves that were bought for that ve&s;&s;el's cargo, were two hundred and &s;ixty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. Containing an account of his life, from the time of his leaving Africa, to that of his becoming free.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER all the bu&s;ine&s;s was ended on the coa&s;t of Africa, the &s;hip &s;ailed from thence to Barbadoes. After an ordinary pa&s;&s;age, except great mortality by the &s;mall pox, which broke out on board, we arrived at the i&s;land of Barbadoes: but when we reached it, there were found out of the two hundred and &s;ixty that &s;ailed from Africa, not more than two hundred alive. The&s;e were all &s;old, except my&s;elf and three more, to the planters there.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034560_0013_0FFE299E842BB7F0">The ve&s;&s;el then &s;ailed for Rhode-I&s;land, and arrived there after a comfortable pa&s;&s;age. Here my ma&s;ter &s;ent me to live with one of his &s;i&s;ters, until he could carry me to Fi&s;her's I&s;land, the place of his re&s;idence. I had then completed my eighth year. After &s;taying with his &s;i&s;ter &s;ome time I was taken to any ma&s;ter's place to live.</P>
<P>When we arrived at Narragan&s;et, my ma&s;ter went a&s;hore in order to return a part of the way by land, and gave me the charge of the keys of his trunks on board the ve&s;&s;el, and charged me not to deliver them up to any body, not even to his father without his orders. To his directions I promi&s;ed faithfully to conform. When I arrived with my ma&s;ter's articles at his hou&s;e, my ma&s;|ter's father a&s;ked me for his &s;on's keys, as he wanted to &s;ee what his trunks contained. I told him that my ma&s;ter intru&s;ted me with the care of them until he &s;hould return, and that I had given him my word to be faith|ful to the tru&s;t, and could not therefore give him or any other per&s;on the keys without my ma&s;ter's directions. He in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould deliver to him the keys, threat|ening to puni&s;h me if I did not. But I let him know that he &s;hould not have them let him &s;ay what he would. He then laid a&s;ide trying to get them. But notwith|&s;tanding he appeared to give up trying to obtain them from me, yet I mi&s;tru&s;ted that he would take &s;ome time when I was off my guard, either in the day time or at night to get them, therefore I &s;lung them round my neck, and in the day time concealed them in my bo&s;om, and at night I always lay with them under me, that no per&s;on might take them from me without being apprized of it. Thus I kept the keys from every body until my ma&s;ter came home. When he returned he a&s;ked where VEN|TURE was. As I was then within hearing, I came, and &s;aid, here &s;ir, at your &s;ervice. He a&s;ked me for his keys, and I immediately took them off my neck and reached them out to him. He took them, &s;troked my hair, and commended me, &s;aying in pre&s;ence of his father that
<PB N="15" REF="034560_0014_0FFE297252DBF8F0">
his young VENTURE was &s;o faithful that he never would have been able to have taken the keys from him but by violence; that he &s;hould not fear to tru&s;t him with his whole fortune, for that he had been in his native place &s;o habituated to keeping his word, that he would &s;acri|fice even his life to maintain it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the time of living at my ma&s;ter's own place, I was pretty much employed in the hou&s;e at card|ing wool and other hou&s;hold bu&s;ine&s;s. In this &s;ituation I continued for &s;ome years, after which my ma&s;ter put me to work out of doors. After many proofs of my faithfulne&s;s and hone&s;ty, my ma&s;ter began to put great confidence in me. My behavior to him had as yet been &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and obedient. I then began to have hard ta&s;ks impo&s;ed on me. Some of the&s;e were to pound four bu&s;hels of ears of corn every night in a barrel for the poultry, or be rigorou&s;ly puni&s;hed. At other &s;ea|&s;ons of the year I had to card wool until a very late hour. The&s;e ta&s;ks I had to perform when I was about nine years old. Some time after I had another difficulty and oppre&s;&s;ion which was greater than any I had ever ex|perienced &s;ince I came into this country. This was to &s;erve two ma&s;ters. James Mumford, my ma&s;ter's &s;on, when his father had gone from home in the morning and given me a &s;tint to perform that day, would order me to do <HI>this</HI> and <HI>that</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s different from what my ma&s;ter directed me. One day in particular, the autho|rity which my ma&s;ter's &s;on had &s;et up, had like to have produced melancholy effects. For my ma&s;ter having &s;et me off my bu&s;ine&s;s to perform that day and then left me to perform it, his &s;on came up to me in the cour&s;e of the day, big with authority, and commanded me very arrogantly to quit my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s and go directly about what he &s;hould order me. I replied to him that my ma&s;ter had given me &s;o much to perform that day, and that I mu&s;t therefore faithfully complete it in that time. He then broke out into a great rage, &s;natched
<PB N="16" REF="034560_0015_0FFE29A169AB3C80">
a pitchfork and went to lay me over the head therewith; but I as &s;oon got another and defended my&s;elf with it, or otherwi&s;e he might have murdered me in his outrage. He immediately called &s;ome people who were within hearing at work for him, and ordered them to take his hair rope and come and bind me with it. They all tried to bind me but in vain, tho' there were three a&s;&s;i&s;tants in number. My up&s;tart ma&s;ter then de&s;i&s;ted, put his pocket handkerchief before his eyes and went home with a de&s;ign to tell his mother of the &s;truggle with young VENTURE. He told her that their young VEN|TURE had become &s;o &s;tubborn that he could not con|troul him, and a&s;ked her what he &s;hould do with him. In the mean time I recovered my temper, voluntarily cau&s;ed my&s;elf to be bound by the &s;ame men who tried in vain before, and carried before my young ma&s;ter, that he might do what he plea&s;ed with me. He took me to a gallows made for the purpo&s;e of hanging cattle on, and &s;u&s;pended me on it. Afterwards he ordered one of his hands to go to the peach orchard and cut him three dozen of whips to puni&s;h me with. The&s;e were brought to him, and that was all that was done with them, as I was relea&s;ed and went to work after hanging on the gallows about an hour.</P>
<P>After I had lived with my ma&s;ter thirteen years, be|ing then about twenty two years old, I married Meg, a &s;lave of his who was about my age. My ma&s;ter owned a certain Iri&s;hman, named Heddy, who about that time formed a plan of &s;ecretly leaving his ma&s;ter. After he had long had this plan in meditation he &s;ugge&s;ted it to me. At fir&s;t I ca&s;t a deaf ear to it, and rebuked Heddy for harboring in his mind &s;uch a ra&s;h undertaking. But after he had per&s;uaded and much enchanted me with the pro&s;pect of gaining my freedom by &s;uch a method, I at length agreed to accompany him. Heddy next inveigled two of his fellow &s;ervants to accompany us. The place to which we de&s;igned to go was the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. Our
<PB N="17" REF="034560_0016_0FFE29754E99A7D8">
next bu&s;ine&s;s was to lay in a &s;ufficient &s;tore of provi&s;ions for our voyage. We privately collected out of our ma&s;ter's &s;tore, &s;ix great old chee&s;es, two firkins of but|ter, and one whole batch of new bread. When we had gathered all our own clothes and &s;ome more, we took them all about midnight, and went to the water &s;ide. We &s;tole our ma&s;ter's boat, embarked, and then directed our cour&s;e for the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi river.</P>
<P>We mutually confederated not to betray or de&s;ert one another on pain of death. We fir&s;t &s;teered our cour&s;e for Montauk point, the ea&s;t end of Long-I&s;land. After our arrival there we landed, and Heddy and I made an incur&s;ion into the i&s;land after fre&s;h water, while our two comrades were left at a little di&s;tance from the boat, employed at cooking. When Heddy and I had &s;ought &s;ome time for water, he returned to our compa|nions, and I continued on looking for my object. When Heddy had performed his bu&s;ine&s;s with our companions who were engaged in cooking, he went directly to the boat, &s;tole all the clothes in it, and then travelled away for Ea&s;t-Hampton, as I was informed. I returned to my fellows not long after. They informed me that our clothes were &s;tolen, but could not determine who was the thief, yet they &s;u&s;pected Heddy as he was mi&s;|&s;ing. After reproving my two comrades for not taking care of our things which were in the boat, I adverti&s;ed Heddy and &s;ent two men in &s;earch of him. They pur&s;ued and overtook him at Southampton and return|ed him to the boat. I then thought it might afford &s;ome chance for my freedom, or at lea&s;t a palliation for my running away, to return Heddy immediately to his ma&s;|ter, and inform him that I was induced to go away by Heddy's addre&s;s. Accordingly I &s;et off with him and the re&s;t of my companions for our ma&s;ter's, and arrived there without any difficulty. I informed my ma&s;ter that Heddy was the ringleader of our revolt, and that he had u&s;ed us ill. He immediately put Heddy into
<PB N="18" REF="034560_0017_0FFE29A2EDE592A0">
cu&s;tody, and my&s;elf and companions were well received and went to work as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Not a long time pa&s;&s;ed after that, before Heddy was &s;ent by my ma&s;ter to New-London gaol. At the clo&s;e of that year I was &s;old to a Thomas Stanton, and had to be &s;eparated from my wife and one daughter, who was about one month old. He re&s;ided at Stonington|point. To this place I brought with me from my late ma&s;ter's, two johannes, three old Spani&s;h dollars, and two thou&s;and of coppers, be&s;ides five pounds of my wife's money. This money I got by cleaning gentle|men's &s;hoes and drawing boots, by catching mu&s;k-rats and minks, rai&s;ing potatoes and carrots, &amp;c. and by fi&s;hing in the night, and at odd &s;pells.</P>
<P>All this money amounting to near twenty-one pounds York currency, my ma&s;ter's brother, Robert Stanton, hired of me, for which he gave me his note. About one year and a half after that time, my ma&s;ter purcha&s;|ed my wife and her child, for &s;even hundred pounds old tenor. One time my ma&s;ter &s;ent me two miles af|ter a barrel of mola&s;&s;es, and ordered me to carry it on my &s;houlders. I made out to carry it all the way to my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e. When I lived with Captain George Mumford, only to try my &s;trength, I took up on my knees a tierce of &s;alt containing &s;even bu&s;hels, and car|ried it two or three rods. Of this fact there are &s;everal eye witne&s;&s;es now living.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the time that I re&s;ided with this ma&s;ter, I had a falling out with my mi&s;tre&s;s. This hap|pened one time when my ma&s;ter was gone to Long-I&s;land a gunning. At fir&s;t the quarrel began between my wi&s;e and her mi&s;tre&s;s. I was then at work in the barn, and hearing a racket in the hou&s;e, induced me to run there and &s;ee what had broken out. When I en|tered the hou&s;e, I found my mi&s;tre&s;s in a violent pa&s;&s;ion with my wife, for what &s;he informed me was a mere trifle; &s;uch a &s;mall affair that I forbear to put my mi&s;|tre&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="034560_0018_0FFE2976E2A9B3F8">
to the &s;hame of having it known. I earne&s;tly re|que&s;ted my wife to beg pardon of her mi&s;tre&s;s for the &s;ake of peace, even if &s;he had given no ju&s;t occa&s;ion for offence. But whil&s;t I was thus &s;aying my mi&s;tre&s;s turned the blows which &s;he was repeating on my wife to me. She took down her hor&s;e-whip, and while &s;he was glutting her fury with it, I reached out my great black hand, rai&s;ed it up and received the blows of the whip on it which were de&s;igned for my head. Then I immediately committed the whip to the devouring fire.</P>
<P>When my ma&s;ter returned from the i&s;land, his wife told him of the affair, but for the pre&s;ent he &s;eemed to take no notice of it, and mentioned not a word about it to me. Some days after his return, in the morning as I was putting on a log in the fire-place, not &s;u&s;pecting harm from any one, I received a mo&s;t violent &s;troke on the crown of my head with a club two feet long and as large round as a chair-po&s;t. This blow very badly wounded my head, and the &s;car of it remains to this day. The fir&s;t blow made me have my wits about me you may &s;uppo&s;e, for as &s;oon as he went to renew it, I &s;natched the club out of his hands and dragged him out of the door. He then &s;ent for his brother to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but I pre&s;ently left my ma&s;ter, took the club he wounded me with, carried it to a neighboring Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and complained of my ma&s;ter. He final|ly advi&s;ed me to return to my ma&s;ter, and live contented with him till he abu&s;ed me again, and then complain. I con&s;ented to do accordingly. But before I &s;et out for my ma&s;ter's, up he come and his brother Robert after me. The Ju&s;tice improved this convenient opportunity to caution my ma&s;ter. He a&s;ked him for what he treat|ed his &s;lave thus ha&s;tily and unju&s;tly, and told him what would be the con&s;equence if he continued the &s;ame treatment towards me. After the Ju&s;tice had ended his di&s;cour&s;e with my ma&s;ter, he and his brother &s;et out with me for home, one before and the other behind me.
<PB N="20" REF="034560_0019_0FFE29A5D88F27B8">
When they had come to a bye place, they both di&s;|mounted their re&s;pective hor&s;es, and fell to beating me with great violence. I became enraged at this and im|mediately turned them both under me, laid one of them acro&s;s the other, and &s;tamped both with my feet what I would.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned my ma&s;ter's brother to advi&s;e him to put me off. A &s;hort time after this I was taken by a con&s;table and two men. They carried me to a black|&s;mith's &s;hop and had me hand-cuffed. When I return|ed home my mi&s;tre&s;s enquired much of her waiters, whether VENTURE was hand-cuffed. When &s;he was informed that I was, &s;he appeared to be very contented and was much tran&s;ported with the news. In the mid&s;t of this content and joy, I pre&s;ented my&s;elf before my mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;hewed her my hand-cuffs, and gave her thanks for my gold rings. For this my ma&s;ter commanded a negro of his to fetch him a large ox chain. This my ma&s;ter locked on my legs with two padlocks. I conti|tinued to wear the chain peaceably for two or three days, when my ma&s;ter a&s;ked me with contemptuous, hard names whether I had not better be freed from my chains and go to work. I an&s;wered him, No. Well then, &s;aid me, I will &s;end you to the We&s;t-Indies or bani&s;h you, for I am re&s;olved not to keep you. I an|&s;wered him I cro&s;&s;ed the waters to come here, and I am willing to cro&s;s them to return.</P>
<P>For a day or two after this not any one &s;aid much to me, until one Hemp&s;ted Miner, of Stonington, a&s;ked me if I would live with him. I an&s;wered him that I would. He then reque&s;ted me to make my&s;elf di&s;con|tented and to appear as unreconciled to my ma&s;ter as I could before that he bargained with him for me; and that in return he would give me a good chance to gain my freedom when I came to live with him. I did as he reque&s;ted me. Not long after Hemp&s;ted Miner purcha&s;|ed me of my ma&s;ter for fifty-&s;ix pounds lawful. He
<PB N="21" REF="034560_0020_0FFE2978941ECD78">
took the chain and padlocks from off me immediately after.</P>
<P>It may here be remembered, that I related a few pages back, that I hired out a &s;um of money to Mr. Robert Stanton, and took his note for it. In the fray between my ma&s;ter Stanton and my&s;elf, he broke open my che&s;t containing his brother's note to me, and de|&s;troyed it. Immediately after my pre&s;ent ma&s;ter bought me, he determined to &s;ell me at Hartford. As &s;oon as I became apprized of it, I bethought my&s;elf that I would &s;ecure a certain &s;um of money which lay by me, &s;afer than to hire it out to a Stanton. Accordingly I buried it in the earth, a little di&s;tance from Thomas Stanton's, in the road over which he pa&s;&s;ed daily. A &s;hort time after my ma&s;ter carried me to Hartford, and fir&s;t propo&s;ed to &s;ell me to one William Hooker of that place. Hooker a&s;ked whether I would go to the Ger|man Flats with him. I an&s;wered, No. He &s;aid I &s;hould, if not by fair means I &s;hould by foul. If you will go by no other mea&s;ures, I will tie you down in my &s;leigh. I replied to him, that if he carried me in that manner, no per&s;on would purcha&s;e me, for it would be thought that he had a murderer for &s;ale. After this he tried no more, and &s;aid he would not have me as a gift.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter next offered me to Daniel Edwards, E&s;q. of Hartford, for &s;ale. But not purcha&s;ing me, my ma&s;|ter pawned me to him for ten pounds, and returned to Stonington. After &s;ome trial of my hone&s;ty, Mr. Ed|wards placed con&s;iderable tru&s;t and confidence in me. He put me to &s;erve as his cup-bearer and waiter. When there was company at his hou&s;e, he would &s;end me into his cellar and other parts of his hou&s;e to fetch wine and other articles occa&s;ionally for them. When I had been with him &s;ome time, he a&s;ked me why my ma&s;ter wi&s;hed to part with &s;uch an hone&s;t negro, and why he did not keep me him&s;elf. I replied that I could not give him the rea&s;on, unle&s;s it was to convert me into ca&s;h, and
<PB N="22" REF="034560_0021_0FFE29A77814F6D0">
&s;peculate with me as with other commodities. I hope that he can never ju&s;tly &s;ay it was on account of my ill conduct that he did not keep me him&s;elf. Mr. Ed|wards told me that he &s;hould be very willing to keep me him&s;elf, and that he would never let me go from him to live, if it was not unrea&s;onable and inconveni|ent for me to be parted from my wife and children; therefore he would furni&s;h me with a hor&s;e to return to Stonington, if I had a mind for it. As Miner did not appear to redeem me I went, and called at my old ma&s;|ter Stanton's fir&s;t to &s;ee my wife, who was then owned by him. As my old ma&s;ter appeared much ruffled at my being there, I left my wife before I had &s;pent any con&s;iderable time with her, and went to Colonel O. Smith's. Miner had not as yet wholly &s;ettled with Stanton for me, and had before my return from Hart|ford given Col. Smith a bill of &s;ale of me. The&s;e men once met to determine which of them &s;hould hold me, and upon my expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to be owned by Col. Smith, and upon my ma&s;ter's &s;ettling the remainder of the money which was due to Stanton for me, it was agreed that I &s;hould live with Col. Smith. This was the third time of my being &s;old, and I was then thirty-one years old. As I never had an opportunity of re|deeming my&s;elf whil&s;t I was owned by Miner, though be promi&s;ed to give me a chance, I was then very ambi|tious of obtaining it. I a&s;ked my ma&s;ter one time if he would con&s;ent to have me purcha&s;e my freedom. He replied that he would. I was then very happy, know|ing that I was at that time able to pay part of the pur|cha&s;e money, by means of the money which I &s;ome time &s;ince buried. This I took out of the earth and ten|dered to my ma&s;ter, having previou&s;ly engaged a free negro man to take his &s;ecurity for it, as I was the pro|perty of my ma&s;ter, and therefore could not &s;afely take his obligation my&s;elf. What was wanting in redeeming my&s;elf, my ma&s;ter agreed to wait on me for, until I
<PB N="23" REF="034560_0022_0FFE297FA65212E8">
could procure it for him. I &s;till continued to work for Col. Smith. There was continually &s;ome intere&s;t ac|cruing on my ma&s;ter's note to my friend the free negro man above named, which I received, and with &s;ome be|&s;ides which I got by fi&s;hing, I laid out in land adjoin|ing my old ma&s;ter Stanton's. By cultivating this land with the greate&s;t diligence and economy, at times when my ma&s;ter did not require my labor, in two years I laid up ten pounds. This my friend tendered my ma&s;ter for my&s;elf, and received his note for it.</P>
<P>Being encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s which I had met in redeeming my&s;elf, I again &s;olicited my ma&s;ter for a fur|ther chance of completing it. The chance for which I &s;olicited him was that of going out to work the en&s;uing winter. He agreed to this on condition that I would give him one quarter of my earnings. On the&s;e terms I worked the following winter, and earned four pounds &s;ixteen &s;hillings, one quarter of which went to my ma&s;|ter for the privilege, and the re&s;t was paid him on my own account. This added to the other payments made up forty four pounds, eight &s;hillings, which I had paid on my own account. I was then about thirty five years old.</P>
<P>The next &s;ummer I again de&s;ired he would give me a chance of going out to work. But he refu&s;ed and an&s;wered that he mu&s;t have my labor this &s;ummer, as he did not have it the pa&s;t winter. I replied that I con&s;i|dered it as hard that I could not have a chance to work out when the &s;ea&s;on became advantageous, and that I mu&s;t only be permitted to hire my&s;elf out in the poore&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year. He a&s;ked me after this what I would give him for the privilege per month. I replied that I would leave it wholly with his own genero&s;ity to deter|mine what I &s;hould return him a month. Well then, &s;aid he, if &s;o two pounds a month. I an&s;wered him that if that was the lea&s;t he would take I would be con|tented.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="034560_0023_0FFDC73317E7E750">Accordingly I hired my&s;elf out at Fi&s;her's I&s;land, and earned twenty pounds; thirteen pounds &s;ix &s;hillings of which my ma&s;ter drew for the privilege, and the re|mainder I paid him for my freedom. This made fifty-one pounds two &s;hillings which I paid him. In October following I went and wrought &s;ix months at Long I&s;land. In that &s;ix month's time I cut and corded four hundred cords of wood, be&s;ides thre&s;hing out &s;eventy-five bu&s;hels of grain, and received of my wages down only twenty pounds, which left remaining a larger &s;um. Whil&s;t I was out that time, I took up on my wages only one pair of &s;hoes. At night I lay on the hearth, with one co|verlet over and another under me. I returned to my ma&s;ter and gave him what I received of my &s;ix months labor. This left only thirteen pounds eighteen &s;hillings to make up the full &s;um for my redemption. My ma&s;ter liberated me, &s;aying that I might pay what was behind if I could ever make it convenient, otherwi&s;e it would be well. The amount of the money which I had paid my ma&s;ter towards redeeming my time, was &s;eventy-one pounds two &s;hillings. The rea&s;on of my ma&s;ter for a&s;king &s;uch an unrea&s;onable price, was he &s;aid, to &s;e|cure him&s;elf in ca&s;e I &s;hould ever come to want. Being thirty-&s;ix years old, I left Col. Smith once for all. I had already been &s;old three different times, made con|&s;iderable money with &s;eemingly nothing to derive it from, been cheated out of a large &s;um of money, lo&s;t much by misfortunes, and paid an enormous &s;um for my free|dom.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Containing an account of his life, from the time of his purcha&s;ing his freedom to the pre&s;ent day.</HEAD>
<P>MY wife and children were yet in bondage to Mr. Thomas Stanton. About this time I lo&s;t a che&s;t, containing be&s;ides clothing, about thirty-eight pounds in paper money. It was burnt by accident. A &s;hort time after I &s;old all my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions at Stonington, con|&s;i&s;ting of a pretty piece of land and one dwelling hou&s;e thereon, and went to re&s;ide at Long-I&s;land. For the fir&s;t four years of my re&s;idence there, I &s;pent my time in working for various people on that and at the neigh|boring i&s;lands. In the &s;pace of &s;ix months I cut and corded upwards of four hundred cords of wood. Many other &s;ingular and wonderful labors I performed in cut|ting wood there, which would not be inferior to tho&s;e ju&s;t recited, but for brevity &s;ake I mu&s;t omit them. In the aforementioned four years what wood I cut at Long-I&s;land amounted to &s;everal thou&s;and cords, and the mo|ney which I earned thereby amounted to two hundred and &s;even pounds ten &s;hillings. This money I laid up carefully by me. Perhaps &s;ome may enquire what main|tained me all the time I was laying up money. I would inform them that I bought nothing which I did not ab&s;o|lutely want. All fine clothes I de&s;pi&s;ed in compari&s;on with my intere&s;t, and never kept but ju&s;t what clothes were comfortable for common days, and perhaps I would have a garment or two which I did not have on at all times, but as for &s;uperfluous finery I never thought it to be compared with a decent home&s;pun dre&s;s, a good &s;upply of money and prudence. Expen&s;ive gatherings of my mates I commonly &s;hunned, and all kinds of lux|uries I was perfectly a &s;tranger to; and during the time
<PB N="26" REF="034560_0025_0FFE29B1747BB6F8">
I was employed in cutting the aforementioned quantity of wood, I never was at the expence of &s;ix-pence worth of &s;pirits. Being after this labour forty years of age, I worked at various places, and in particular on Ram-I&s;land, where I purcha&s;ed Solomon and Cuff, two &s;ons of mine, for two hundred dollars each.</P>
<P>It will here be remembered how much money I earn|ed by cutting wood in four years. Be&s;ides this I had con&s;iderable money, amounting in all to near three hundred pounds. When I had purcha&s;ed my two &s;ons, I had then left more than one hundred pounds. After this I purcha&s;ed a negro man, for no other rea&s;on than to oblige him, and gave for him &s;ixty pounds. But in a &s;hort time after he run away from me, and I thereby lo&s;t all that I gave for him, except twenty pounds which he paid me previous to his ab&s;conding. The re&s;t of my money I laid out in land, in addition to a farm which I owned before, and a dwelling hou&s;e thereon. Forty four years had then completed their revolution &s;ince my entrance into this exi&s;tence of &s;ervitude and misfortune. Solomon my elde&s;t &s;on, being then in his &s;eventeenth year, and all my hope and dependence for help, I hired him out to one Charles Church, of Rhode-I&s;land, for one year, on con&s;ideration of his giving him twelve pounds and an opportunity of acquiring &s;ome learning. In the cour&s;e of the year, Church fitted out a ve&s;&s;el for a whaling voyage, and being in want of hands to man her, he induced my &s;on to go, with the promi&s;e of giv|ing him on his return, a pair of &s;ilver buckles, be&s;ides his wages. As &s;oon as I heard of his going to &s;ea, I immediately &s;et out to go and prevent it if po&s;&s;ible.&mdash; But on my arrival at Church's, to my great grief, I could only &s;ee the ve&s;&s;el my &s;on was in almo&s;t out of &s;ight going to &s;ea. My &s;on died of the &s;curvy in this voyage, and Church has never yet paid me the lea&s;t of his wa|ges. In my &s;on, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of his life, I lo&s;t equal to &s;eventy-five pounds.</P>

About this time I chartered a &s;loop of about thirty tons burthen, and hired men to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in navigating her. I employed her mo&s;tly in the wood trade to Rhode|I&s;land, and made clear of all expences above one hun|dred dollars with her in better than one year. I had then become &s;omething forehanded, and being in my forty-fourth year, I purcha&s;ed my wife Meg, and there|by prevented having another child to buy, as &s;he was then pregnant. I gave forty pounds for her.</P>
<P>During my re&s;idence at Long-I&s;land, I rai&s;ed one year with another, ten cart loads of water-melons, and lo&s;t a great many every year be&s;ides by the thievi&s;hne&s;s of the &s;ailors. What I made by the water-melons I &s;old there, amounted to nearly five hundred dollars. Va|rious other methods I pur&s;ued in order to enable me to redeem my family. In the night time I fi&s;hed with &s;et-nets and pots for eels and lob&s;ters, and &s;hortly after went a whaling voyage in the &s;ervice of Col. Smith.&mdash; After being out &s;even months, the ve&s;&s;el returned, laden with four hundred barrels of oil. About this time, I become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of another dwelling-hou&s;e, and my temporal affairs were in a pretty pro&s;perous condition. This and my indu&s;try was what alone &s;aved me from be|ing expelled that part of the i&s;land in which I re&s;ided, as an act was pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;elect-men of the place, that all negroes re&s;iding there &s;hould be expelled.</P>
<P>Next after my wife, I purcha&s;ed a negro man for four hundred dollars. But he having an inclination to return to his old ma&s;ter, I therefore let him go. Shortly after I purcha&s;ed another negro man for twenty-five pounds, whom I parted with &s;hortly after.</P>
<P>Being about forty-&s;ix years old, I bought my olde&s;t child Hannah, of Ray Mumford, for forty-four pounds, and &s;he &s;till re&s;ided with him. I had already redeemed from &s;lavery, my&s;elf, my wife and three children, be|&s;ides three negro men.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="034560_0027_0FFE29B2F6F2DD30">About the forty-&s;eventh year of my life, I di&s;po&s;ed of all my property at Long-I&s;land, and came from thence into Ea&s;t-Haddam. I hired my&s;elf out at fir&s;t to Timo|thy Chapman, for five weeks, the earnings of which time I put up carefully by me. After this I wrought for Abel Bingham about &s;ix weeks. I then put my mo|ney together and purcha&s;ed of &s;aid Bingham ten acres of land, lying at Haddam neck&punc; where I now re&s;ide.&mdash; On this land I labored with great diligence for two years, and &s;hortly after purcha&s;ed &s;ix acres more of land con|tiguous to my other. One year from that time I pur|cha&s;ed &s;eventy acres more of the &s;ame man, and paid for it mo&s;tly with the produce of my other land. Soon after I bought this la&s;t lot of land, I &s;et up a comfortable dwelling hou&s;e on my farm, and built it from the produce thereof. Shortly after I had much trouble and expence with my daughter Hannah, who&s;e name has before been mentioned in this account. She was married &s;oon after I redeemed her, to one I&s;aac, a free negro, and &s;hort|ly after her marriage fell &s;ick of a mortal di&s;ea&s;e; her hu&s;band a di&s;&s;olute and abandoned wretch, paid but lit|tle attention to her in her illne&s;s. I therefore thought it be&s;t to bring her to my hou&s;e and nur&s;e her there. I procured her all the aid mortals could afford, but not|with&s;tanding this &s;he fell a prey to her di&s;ea&s;e, after a lingering and painful endurance of it.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician's bills for attending her during her ill|ne&s;s amounted to forty pounds. Having reached my fifty-fourth year, a hired two negro men, one named William Jacklin, and the other Mingo. Mingo lived with me one year, and having received his wages, run in debt to me eight dollars, for which he gave me his note. Pre&s;ently after he tried to run away from me without troubling him&s;elf to pay up his note. I procured a warrant, took him, and reque&s;ted him to go to Ju&s;tice Throop's of his own accord, but he refu&s;ing, I took him on my &s;houlders, and carried him there, di&s;tant
<PB N="29" REF="034560_0028_0FFE29859BD601D0">
about two miles. The ju&s;tice a&s;king me if I had my pri&s;oner's note with me, and replying that I had not, he told me that I mu&s;t return with him and get it. Ac|cordingly I carried Mingo back on my &s;houlders, but before we arrived at my dwelling, he complained of be|ing hurt, and a&s;ked me if this was not a hard way of treating our fellow creatures. I an&s;wered him that it would be hard thus to treat our hone&s;t fellow creatures. He then told me that if I would let him off my &s;houlders, he had a pair of &s;ilver &s;hoe-buckles, one &s;hirt and a pocket handkerchief, which he would turn out to me. I agreed, and let him return home with me on foot; but the very following night, he &s;lipped from me, &s;tole my hor&s;e and has never paid me even his note. The other negro man, Jacklin, being a comb-maker by trade, he reque&s;ted me to &s;et him up, and promi&s;ed to reward me well with his labor. Accordingly I bought him a &s;et of tools for making combs, and procured him &s;tock. He worked at my hou&s;e about one year, and then run away from me with all his combs, and owed me for all his board.</P>
<P>Since my re&s;idence at Haddam neck, I have owned of boats, canoes and &s;ail ve&s;&s;els, not le&s;s than twenty. The&s;e I mo&s;tly employed in the fi&s;hing and trafficking bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the&s;e occupations I have been cheated out of con&s;iderable money by people whom I traded with taking advantage of my ignorance of numbers.</P>
<P>About twelve years ago, I hired a whale-boat and four black men, and proceeded to Long-I&s;land after a load of round clams. Having arrived there, I fir&s;t pur|cha&s;ed of James Webb, &s;on of Orange Webb, &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty clams, and afterwards, with the help of my men, fini&s;hed loading my boat. The &s;ame even|ing, however, this Webb &s;tole my boat, and went in her to Connecticut river, and &s;old her cargo for his own benefit. I thereupon pur&s;ued him, and at length, after an additional expence of nine crowns, recovered the
<PB N="30" REF="034560_0029_0FFE29B478017E70">
boat; but for the proceeds of her cargo I never could obtain any compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Four years after, I met with another lo&s;s, far &s;upe|rior to this in value, and I think by no le&s;s wicked means. Being going to New-London with a grand-child, I took pa&s;&s;age in an Indian's boat, and went there with him. On our return, the Indian took on board two hog&s;heads of mola&s;&s;es, one of which belonged to Capt. Eli&s;ha Hart, of Saybrook, to be delivered on his wharf. When we arrived there, and while I was gone, at the reque&s;t of the Indian, to inform Captain Hart of his arrival, and receive the freight for him, one hog&s;head of the mola&s;&s;es had been lo&s;t overboard by the people in attempting to land it on the wharf. Although I was ab&s;ent at the time, and had no concern whatever in the bu&s;ine&s;s, as was known to a number of re&s;pectable wit|ne&s;&s;es, I was neverthele&s;s pro&s;ecuted by this con&s;cien|tious gentleman, (the Indian not being able to pay for it) and obliged to pay upwards of ten pounds lawful money, with all the co&s;ts of court. I applied to &s;e|veral gentlemen for coun&s;el in this affair, and they ad|vi&s;ed me, as my adver&s;ary was rich, and threatened to carry the matter from court to court till it would co&s;t me more than the fir&s;t damages would be, to pay the &s;um and &s;ubmit to the injury; which I according did, and he has often &s;ince in&s;ultingly taunted me with my unmerited misfortune. Such a proceeding as this, com|mitted on a defencele&s;s &s;tranger, almo&s;t worn out in the hard &s;ervice of the world, without any foundation in rea&s;on or ju&s;tice, whatever it may be called in a chri&s;tian land, would in my native country have been branded as a crime equal to highway robbery. But Captain Hart was a <HI>white gentleman,</HI> and I a <HI>poor Afri|can,</HI> therefore it was <HI>all right, and good enough for the black dog.</HI></P>
<P>I am now &s;ixty nine years old. Though once &s;trait and tall, mea&s;uring without &s;hoes &s;ix feet one inch and
<PB N="31" REF="034560_0030_0FFE298B69BD5168">
an half, and every way well proportioned, I am now bowed down with age and hard&s;hip. My &s;trength which was once equal if not &s;uperior to any man whom I have ever &s;een, is now enfeebled &s;o that life is a bur|den, and it is with fatigue that I can walk a couple of miles, &s;tooping over my &s;taff. Other griefs are &s;till behind; on account of which &s;ome aged people, at lea&s;t, will pity me. My eye-&s;ight has gradually failed, till I am almo&s;t blind, and whenever I go abroad one of my grand-children mu&s;t direct my way; be&s;ides for many years I have been much pained and troubled with an ulcer on one of my legs. But amid&s;t: all my griefs and pains, I have many con&s;olations; Meg, the wife of my youth, whom I married for love, and bought with my money, is &s;till alive. My freedom is a privilege which nothing el&s;e can equal. Notwith&s;tanding all the lo&s;&s;es I have &s;uffered by fire, by the inju&s;tice of knaves, by the cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion of fal&s;e hearted friends, and the per&s;idy of my own countrymen whom I have a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed and redeemed from bondage, I am now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than one hundred acres of land, and three habit|able dwelling hou&s;es. It gives me joy to think that I <HI>have</HI> and that I <HI>de&s;erve</HI> &s;o good a character, e&s;pecially for <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>integrity.</HI> While I am now looking to the grave as my home, my joy for this world would be full&mdash;IF my children, Cuff for whom I paid two hun|dred dollars when a boy, and Solomon who was born &s;oon after I purcha&s;ed his mother&mdash;If Cuff and Solomon &mdash;O! that they had walked in the way of their father. But a father's lips are clo&s;ed in &s;ilence and in grief!&mdash; Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!</P>
