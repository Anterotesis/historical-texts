<P>When the hand of tyranny, armed in bo&s;tile man|ner, was extended from Great-Britain to &s;poil Ame|rica of whatever &s;he held mo&s;t valuable; it was, for the mo&s;t important purpo&s;es, that the good people of this colony delegated you, to repre&s;ent them in the Continental Congre&s;s at Philadelphia.&mdash;It became your bu&s;ine&s;s to a&s;certain the rights of America&mdash;to point out her violated franchi&s;es&mdash;to make humble repre&s;entation to the King for redre&s;s&mdash;and&mdash; he be|ing deaf to the cries of his American &s;ubjects&mdash;to appeal to the King of Kings, for the recovery of the rights of an infant people, by the Maje&s;ty of Heaven formed for future empire.</P>

<P>In an important cri&s;is like the pre&s;ent, to receive the public thanks of a free people, is to receive the mo&s;t honourable recompence for pa&s;t &s;ervices&mdash;and to de&s;erve &s;uch thanks, is to be truly great.

<P>THE very great, un&s;olicited, and unexpected honour, which you have been plea&s;ed to confer on me, has overwhelmed me, with gratitude and concern.&mdash;Permit me to return you my mo&s;t &s;incere thanks, for &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing, and un|merited, a mark, of your confidence and e&s;teem.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honourable Gentlemen of the Legi&s;lative Council, Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the General A&s;&s;embly.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has afforded me much &s;atisfaction, to ob&s;erve, that though the &s;ea&s;on of the year rendered your &s;itting very inconvenient; your private concerns, which mu&s;t have &s;uffered greatly by your long and clo&s;e application in the late Congre&s;s to the affairs of this colony, requiring your pre&s;ence in the country; yet, continuing to prefer the public weal to ea&s;e and retirement, you have been bu&s;ily engaged, in fram|ing &s;uch laws, as our peculiar circum&s;tances render|ed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be pa&s;&s;ed, before your ad|journment.&mdash;Having given my a&s;&s;ent to them, I pre|&s;ume you are now de&s;irous of a rece&s;s.</P>
<P>On my part, a mo&s;t &s;olemn oath has been taken, for the faithful di&s;charge of my duty&mdash;On yours, a &s;o|lemn a&s;&s;urance has been given, to &s;upport me therein. &mdash;Thus, a public compact, between us, &s;tands re|corded.&mdash;You may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that I &s;hall keep this oath ever in mind&mdash;the Con&s;titution &s;hall be the in|variable rule of my conduct&mdash;my ears &s;hall be always open, to the complaints of the injured&mdash;Ju&s;tice, in mercy, &s;hall neither be denied, or delayed&mdash;Our Laws and Religion, and the Liberties of America &s;hall be maintained and defended, to the utmo&s;t of my power.&mdash;I repo&s;e the mo&s;t perfect confidence in your engagement.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="015091_0159_0F95D165ACF458B8">And now, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> let me intreat, that you will in your &s;everal pari&s;hes and di&s;tricts, u&s;e your influ|ence and authority, to keep peace, and good order, and procure &s;trict ob&s;ervance of, and ready obedience to, the Law.&mdash; If any per&s;ons, therein, are &s;till &s;trangers to the nature and merits of the di&s;pute be|tween Great-Britain and the Colonies, you will, ex|plain it to them fully, and teach them, if they are &s;o unfortunate as not to know, their inherent Rights. &mdash;Prove to them, that the Privileges of being tried by a jury of the vicinage, acquainted with the parties and witne&s;&s;es; of being taxed only with their own con&s;ent, given by their Repre&s;entatives, freely cho&s;en by, and &s;haring the burthen, equally, with them&s;elves, not for the aggrandizing a rapacious mini&s;ter, and his dependant favourites, and for corrupting the peo|ple, and &s;uverting their Liberties, but, for &s;uch wi&s;e and &s;alutary purpo&s;es, as they them&s;elves ap|prove; and of having their internal polity regulated, only by laws, con&s;ented to, by competent judges of what is be&s;t adapted to their &s;ituation and circum|&s;tances, equally bound too by tho&s;e laws, are INESTIMABLE, and derived from that Con&s;titution, which is the birthright of the poore&s;t man, and the be&s;t inheritance of the mo&s;t wealthy.&mdash;Relate to them, the various unju&s;t, and cruel &s;tatutes, which the Briti&s;h Parliament, claiming a right <HI>to make laws for binding the colonies in all ca&s;es what&s;oever,</HI> have enacted, and the many &s;anguinary mea&s;ures, which have been, and are, daily, pur&s;ued, and threatened, to wre&s;t from them tho&s;e invaluable benefits, and to enforce &s;uch an unlimited and de&s;tructive claim. To the mo&s;t illiterate it mu&s;t appear, that no power
<PB N="161" REF="015091_0160_0F95D16672516C88">
on earth can, of right, deprive them of the hardly-earned fruits of their hone&s;t indu&s;try, toil and la|bour&mdash;even to them, the impious attempt, to pre|vent many thou&s;ands, from u&s;ing the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, provided for man, by the bounty of his Creator, and to compel them, by famine, to &s;urrender their rights, will &s;eem to call for Divine Vengeance.&mdash;The endeavours, by deceit and bribe|ry, to engage barbarous nations, to embrue their hands, in the innocent blood, of helple&s;s women and children, and the attempts, by fair but fal&s;e promi&s;es, to make ignorant dome&s;ticks, &s;ub&s;ervi|ent, to the mo&s;t wicked purpo&s;es, are acts, at which humanity mu&s;t revolt.</P>
<P>Shew your con&s;tituents, then, the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity which there was, for e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome mode of government in this colony; the benefits of <HI>that,</HI> which a full and free repre&s;entation has e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, that the con&s;ent of the people is the origin, and their happine&s;s, the end of govern|ment.&mdash;Remove the apprehen&s;ions with which ho|ne&s;t and well-meaning, but weak and credulous minds, may be alarmed; and prevent ill impre&s;|&s;ions by artful and de&s;igning enemies.&mdash;Let it be known, that this con&s;titution is but temporary&mdash; till an accommodation of the unhappy differences between Great-Britain and America can be ob|tained; and that &s;uch an event is &s;till de&s;ired, by men who yet remember former friend&s;hips and intimate connections, though, for defending their per&s;ons and properties, they are &s;tigmatized and treated as Rebels.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="015091_0161_0F95D1672E15B6D8">Truth, being known, will prevail over artifice and mi&s;repre&s;entation&mdash;Conviction mu&s;t follow its di&s;covery.&mdash;In &s;uch a ca&s;e, no man, who is wor|thy of life, liberty or property, will, or can, refu&s;e to join you, in defending them to the la&s;t extre|mity&mdash;Di&s;daining every &s;ordid view, and the mean paltry con&s;iderations of private intere&s;t, and pre&s;ent emolument, when placed in competition, with the liberties of millions; and &s;eeing that there is no alternative, but, ab&s;olute unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, or a defence becoming men, born to freedom, he will not he&s;itate about the choice.&mdash;Although &s;uperior force may, by the permi&s;&s;ion of Heaven, lay wa&s;te our towns, and ravage our country, it can never eradicate, from the brea&s;ts of freemen, tho&s;e principles which are in|grafted in their very nature&mdash;&s;uch men will do their duty, neither knowing, or regarding, con|&s;equences, but, &s;ubmitting them, with humble confidence, to the Omni&s;cient and Omnipotent Arbiter, and Director, of the fate of empires, and tru&s;ting that his Almighty Arm, which has been &s;o &s;ignally &s;tretched out for our defence, will de|liver them, in a righteous cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The eyes of Europe, nay of the whole world, are on America.&mdash;The eyes of every other colony, are on this&mdash;a colony, who&s;e reputation, for gene|ro&s;ity and magnanimity, is univer&s;ally acknow|ledged. I tru&s;t, therefore, it will not be dimini&s;hed by our future conduct; that there will be no civil di&s;cord here; and that, the only &s;trife among&s;t brethren will be, who &s;hall do mo&s;t, to &s;erve, and to &s;ave, an oppre&s;&s;ed and injured country.</P>
