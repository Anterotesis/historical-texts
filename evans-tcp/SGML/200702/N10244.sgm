<P>THE following SERMON, printed in <HI>London,</HI> and re-printed in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> is admirably well adapted to lead tho&s;e, who may think proper to read it, into ju&s;t Sentiments of the <HI>im|policy</HI> of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try in their conduct towards the Colonies, and of the only effectual method they can take to promote that love, harmony, peace, and mutual confidence, without which neither <HI>England,</HI> nor <HI>America,</HI> can be truly happy. It has been highly &s;poken of, by the be&s;t writers on the &s;ide of Liberty, in the public Papers at home, and recom|mended to the peru&s;al of all, who have at heart the real wel|fare of the <HI>whole</HI> Briti&s;h Empire, and not a detached part of it only. As it was preached by a Lord Bi&s;hop, and before &s;o great and re&s;pectable a Body as the honorable Society for pro|pagating the Go&s;pel, it will, doubtle&s;s, be thought eminently worthy of the attention of <HI>Epi&s;copalians</HI> in this part of the world; e&s;pecially, as it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to con|tain the real &s;entiments of that Society, who have give their thanks to the preacher of this Sermon, and de&s;ired its publi|cation for the common good. Some parts of this Sermon re|late peculiarly to the affairs of the Society before whom it was preached; for which rea&s;on, tho&s;e parts of the Sermon might have been omitted: but it was judged expedient to re|print the <HI>whole,</HI> le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;aid, detached pa&s;&s;ages only were &s;elected, and others &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, with a view to &s;erve a turn.</P>

<BIBL>LUKE CHAP. ii. VER. 14.</BIBL>
<Q>Glory be to God in the highe&s;t, and on Earth Peace, good will towards Men.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I KNOW no pa&s;&s;age in the holy &s;criptures, that may be adapted with more propriety to our pre&s;ent meeting, than this declaration from the angel of the gracious purpo&s;es of Heaven in publi&s;hing the Go&s;pel. That which was the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel it&s;elf mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be the chief object of a Society in&s;tituted to propagate it. The generous office, we have undertaken, is by in&s;tructing di&s;tant countries in religious truths to promote the peace and happine&s;s of mankind. It is by &s;uch actions that the holy &s;criptures allow the &s;ons of men to con&s;ider them&s;elves as glorifying God; and &s;uch, we are a&s;&s;ured, are the mo&s;t likely to obtain his favour and good will to men. Without entering into a farther explication of the words, &s;uffer me to de&s;ire that you will keep in your minds the general principle contained in them; and you will find it ea&s;ily applicable to the facts, the circum&s;tances, and the different &s;ituations of things,
<PB N="4" REF="013009_0004_0F8FB13D4D025280">
which I &s;hall take leave to mention&punc; as being more or le&s;s connected with the credit and influence of this Society.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object of our zeal was the conver&s;ion of the Indians; and it &s;hould &s;eem no difficult ta&s;k to influence the minds of men, who have few religious notions of their own growth, and appear to have no &s;trong prejudices in favour of them Such minds one would think might ea&s;ily be led to receive a religion of the mo&s;t &s;imple form, con&s;i&s;ting of a few great luminous principles, and incul|cating plain rules of life and conduct, which mu&s;t approve their u&s;efulne&s;s in de&s;arts, as well as in cities. Such doctrines founded on Divine authority, would, in all appearance be particularly welcome, where the re&s;traints of law and government have but little force. Yet it has happened contrary to our hopes, that the preaching of the go&s;pel has been of &s;mall efficacy among&s;t the Indians. The &s;agacity for which they are remarkable &s;eems to be of a partial kind, and to partake more of in&s;tinct than of rea&s;on. They can employ great art to obtain their ends; to procure what they de&s;ire; or to gain a &s;uperiority over an enemy; but their pa&s;&s;ions and habits proceeding al|ways in one narrow track, they have neither reli&s;h nor di&s;|cernment for the cleare&s;t truths, to which they have not been accu&s;tomed. After &s;hewing the greate&s;t addre&s;s and courage in &s;ubduing or &s;urpri&s;ing an enemy, they cannot comprehend that it would be generous not to tor|ture him; and that it would be wi&s;e to give &s;uch treatment as they would wi&s;h to receive. They have be&s;ides an un|tameable &s;avage &s;pirit, which has refu&s;ed to hear the voice of in&s;truction; which has ob&s;tinately rejected the arts and improvements of the Europeans, and has hitherto only adopted the mo&s;t bea&s;tly of their vices.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, though we ought not to remit our endeavours, yet I fear we have little rea&s;on to hope for their conver&s;ion, till &s;ome great change in their manners
<PB N="5" REF="013009_0005_0F8FB13DF15760D0">
has made them abandon their &s;avage vagrant life, and prepared them for the di&s;cipline of law and religion.</P>
<P>But a more promi&s;ing field is opened to our hopes, in the populous provinces of our own colonies. The rapid increa&s;e of their numbers on every &s;ide, in a country where the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence are ea&s;y and open, together with the perpetual acce&s;&s;ion of inhabitants from Europe are continually forming new congregations. Now know|ledge of all kinds will probably be rare among&s;t men who are entering into the fir&s;t rudiments of &s;ociety; and while their attention is bent on procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life, it is not to be expected that they &s;hould be either diligent or &s;ucce&s;sful in the improvement of religious knowledge. Here therefore the in&s;tructions that are conveyed to them by the liberality of this Society, may be of e&s;&s;ential and durable &s;ervice. This is &s;owing the good &s;eed in a fruitful &s;oil; and what is &s;o planted may produce returns of an hundred fold, and afford fruit and nouri&s;hment to future generations. Allow me to indulge a little the plea&s;ure of contemplating to pro&s;pect the good that may re&s;ult in after times from this our labour of love.</P>
<P>Perhaps the annals of hi&s;tory have never afforded a more grateful &s;pectacle to a benevolent and philo&s;ophick mind than the growth and progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h colo|nies in North America. We &s;ee a number of &s;cattered &s;ettlements, formed at fir&s;t for the purpo&s;es of trade, or from a &s;pirit of enterprize; to procure a maintenance, or to enjoy the exerci&s;e of their religion, <HI>which in tho&s;e un|happy days was refu&s;ed them at home,</HI> growing by de|grees, under the protection of their mother country, who treated them with the indulgence due to their weakne&s;s and infancy, into little &s;eperate common-wealths. Placed in a climate, that &s;oon became fruitful and healthy by their indu&s;try; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that liberty which was the <HI>natural growth of their own country,</HI> and &s;ecured by her
<PB N="6" REF="013009_0006_0F8FB14199A6B238">
power again&s;t foreign enemies, they &s;eem to have been intended, as a &s;olitary experiment, to in&s;truct the world to what improvements and happine&s;s mankind will natu|rally attain, when they are &s;uffered to u&s;e their own prudence, in &s;earch of their own intere&s;t. I mu&s;t repeat it again as an ob&s;ervation not unworthy of this audience and this occa&s;ion, that there is no in&s;tance in the records of time, where infant colonies have been treated with &s;uch a ju&s;t and liberal indulgence.</P>
<P>Had the&s;e &s;ettlements been left to &s;hift for them&s;elves, they would have peri&s;hed and been &s;wept away by the rough cour&s;e of accidents, like &s;eeds that are &s;cattered by the winds, of which not one in a thou&s;and take root and come to maturity. Had they been planted by any king|dom but our own, the inhabitants would have carried with them the chains and oppre&s;&s;ion, to which they had been inured at home: they would have been &s;ubject to the &s;chemes of mini&s;ters and favourites, and have &s;uffered more from their ignorance than from their rapine. At be&s;t they could only have hoped to be con&s;idered as the live &s;tock upon a lucrative farm, which might &s;ometimes be &s;uffered to thrive for the &s;ake of it's produce.</P>
<P>But Britain from the beginning has treated her colo|nies in a very different manner. She has not &s;old them her protection at the price of their liberty; &s;he has al|ways been ready to encourage their indu&s;try, to relieve their wants, and to revenge their injuries; and has &s;ought no other advantage from &s;o generous a conduct, but the mutual benefit ari&s;ing to di&s;tant countries from the &s;upply of each other's wants. Adhering to the&s;e maxims, &s;he has continued to reap the fruits of her own wi&s;dom and moderation in a &s;urpri&s;ing encrea&s;e of na|tional greatne&s;s; while her pro&s;perous colonies are &s;preading without interruption over a va&s;t continent, that may in a few centuries rival the commerce, the arts and the power of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="013009_0007_0F8FB142CB75B740">
It is difficult for man to look into the de&s;tiny of future ages, the de&s;igns of Providence are too va&s;t and compli|cated, and our own powers are too narrow, to admit of much &s;atisfaction to our curio&s;ity. But when we &s;ee many great and powerful cau&s;es con&s;tantly at work, we cannot doubt of their producing proportionable effects. The colonies in North America have not only taken root and acquired &s;trength; but &s;eem ha&s;tening with an accelerated progre&s;s to &s;uch a powerful &s;tate, as may in|troduce a new and important change in human affairs. De&s;cended from ance&s;tors of the mo&s;t improved and enlightened part of the old world, they receive as it were by inheritance all the improvements and di&s;coveries of their mother-country. And it happens fortunately for them to commerce their flouri&s;hing &s;tate at a time when the human under&s;tanding has attained to the free u&s;e of it's powers, and has learned to act with vigour and certainty. They may avail them&s;elves not only of the experience and indu&s;try, but even of the errors and mi&s;takes of former days. Let it be con&s;idered for how many ages great part of the world appears not to have thought at all; how many more they have been bu&s;ied in forming &s;y&s;tems and conjectures; while rea&s;on has been lo&s;t in a labyrinth of words, and they never &s;eem to have &s;u&s;pected, on what frivolous matters their minds were employed. And let it be well under&s;tood, what rapid improvements, what important di&s;coveries have been made in a few years, by a few countries, with our own at their head which have at la&s;t di&s;covered the right method of u&s;ing their faculties. May we not rea|&s;onably expect that a number of provinces, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e advantages, and quickened by mutual emulation, with only the common progre&s;s of the human mind, &s;hould very con&s;iderably enlarge the boundaries of &s;cience. The va&s;t continent it&s;elf, over which they are gradually &s;preading, may be con&s;idered as a trea&s;ure, yet untouched
<PB N="8" REF="013009_0008_0F8FB143867FC1E0">
of natural productions, that &s;hall hereafter afford ample matter for commerce and contemplation. And if we reflect what a &s;tock of knowledge may be accumulated by the con&s;tant progre&s;s of indu&s;try and ob&s;ervation, fed with fre&s;h &s;upplies from the &s;tores of nature, a&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;ometimes by tho&s;e happy &s;trokes of chance, which mock all the powers of invention, and &s;ometimes by tho&s;e &s;uperior characters which ari&s;e occa&s;ionally to in&s;truct and enlighten the world; it is difficult even to imagine to what heighth of improvement their di&s;coveries may extend.</P>
<P>And perhaps they may make as con&s;iderable advances in the arts of civil government and the conduct of life.</P>
<P>We have rea&s;on to be proud, and even jealous, of our excellent con&s;titution. But tho&s;e equitable principles on which it was formed, an equal repre&s;entation,(the be&s;t di&s;covery of political wi&s;dom) and a ju&s;t and commo|dious di&s;tribution of power, which with us were the price of civil wars, and the reward of the virtues and &s;ufferings of our ance&s;tors, de&s;cend to them as a natural inheritance, without toil or pain. But mu&s;t they re&s;t here as in the utmo&s;t effort of human genius? Can chance and time, the wi&s;dom and the experience of publick men, &s;ugge&s;t no new remedy again&s;t the evils, their vices and ambition are perpetually apt to cau&s;e? May they not hope without pre&s;umption to pre&s;erve a greater zeal for piety and publick devotion than we have done? For &s;ure it can hardly happen to them, as it has to us, that when religion is be&s;t under&s;tood and rendered mo&s;t pure and rea&s;onable, that then &s;hould be the preci&s;e time, when many cea&s;e to believe and practi&s;e it, and all in general become mo&s;t indifferent to it. May they not po&s;&s;ibly be more &s;ucce&s;sful than their mother-country has been, in pre&s;erving that reverence and authority, which is due to the laws? to tho&s;e who make? and to tho&s;e who execute them? May not a method be invented of
<PB N="9" REF="013009_0009_0F8FB144039CA308">
procuring &s;ome tolerable &s;hare of the comforts of life to tho&s;e inferior u&s;eful ranks of men, to who&s;e indu&s;try we are indebted for the whole? Time and di&s;cipline may di&s;cover &s;ome means to correct the extreme inequa|lities of condition between the rich and the poor, &s;o dangerous to the innocence and the happine&s;s of both. They may fortunately be led by habit and choice to de&s;|pi&s;e that luxury, which is con&s;idered with us as the true enjoyment of wealth. They may have little reli&s;h for that cea&s;ele&s;s hurry of amu&s;ements, which is pur&s;ued in this country without plea&s;ure exerci&s;e, or employment. And perhaps after trying &s;ome of our follies and caprices, and rejecting the re&s;t, they may be led by rea&s;on and experiment to that old &s;implicity, which was fir&s;t pointed out by nature, and has produced tho&s;e models which we &s;till admire in arts, eloquence and manners. The di|ver&s;ity of new &s;cenes and &s;ituations, which &s;o many growing &s;tates mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s through, may intro|duce changes in the fluctuating opinions and manners of men, which we can form no conception of. And not only the gracious di&s;po&s;ition of Providence, but the vi&s;i|ble preparation of cau&s;es, &s;eems to indicate &s;trong ten|dencies towards a general improvement.</P>
<P>And I hope that the&s;e matters, which I have pre&s;umed to dwell upon, perhaps a little too minutely, will not appear totally foreign to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, if we reflect that to whatever limits the population of our colonies may extend, whatever &s;tates and kingdoms they may form; through all the progre&s;s of their fortunes and pro&s;perity; the labours of this Society will probably continue to operate with an increa&s;ing influence. That &s;ober and rea&s;onable &s;en&s;e of duty, which has been taught under our direction to a few &s;cattered villages, may give it's character hereafter to the religion and morals of a powerful &s;tate. The weak and imperfect fruits we reap at pre&s;ent may bear no higher proportion
<PB N="10" REF="013009_0010_0F8FB144C1607290">
to the future benefits that may ari&s;e, than that of a few &s;cattered &s;eeds to the fulne&s;s of the harve&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>And perhaps</HI> the di&s;intere&s;ted zeal of this Society for the in&s;truction of our brethren in North America, may tend to REVIVE that union and cordiality between the mother country and it's colonies, which for the common utility ought never to have been interrupted. It is by no means decent from this place to cen&s;ure the conduct of our &s;uperiors, or even to &s;uppo&s;e it blameable; but &s;urely as goods &s;ubjects we may wi&s;h and endeavour to heal the wounds of our country, without enquiring by what hand they were inflicted. We may, and I think we ought to wi&s;h, that the true intere&s;t of the whole exten|&s;ive community may govern our future conte&s;ts, and regulate all our claims. Our mutual relation was formed, and has hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, by a perpetual communication of benefits. We want the produce of &s;oils and climates, that differ &s;o much from our own; and they will long have occa&s;ion for the fruits of our arts, our indu&s;try and our experience. And &s;hould they ever cea&s;e to want our protection, which as long as we render it beneficial to them they never will; yet we may &s;till continue united in intere&s;t in commerce and the grateful remembrance of old &s;ervices. May the wi&s;e and good on both &s;ides, <HI>without enquiring too curiou&s;ly</HI> into the grounds of pa&s;t animo&s;ities, endeavour by all prudent means to re&s;tore that old publick friend&s;hip and confidence, which made us great, happy and victorious. To countries &s;o clo&s;ely united it is needle&s;s, and even dangerous, to have recour&s;e to the interpretation of charters and written laws. Such di&s;cu&s;&s;ions excite jealou&s;y, and intimate an unfriendly di&s;po&s;ition. It is common utility, mutual wants and mutual &s;ervices, that &s;hould point out the true line of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and authority. Let them re&s;pect the power that &s;aved them; and let us always love the companions of our dangers and our glories. If we con&s;ider their
<PB N="11" REF="013009_0011_0F8FB1457B323490">
pro&s;perity as making part of our own, we &s;hall feel no jealou&s;y at their improvements: and they will always chearfully &s;ubmit to an authority, which they find is exerci&s;ed invariably to the common advantage. During all our happy days of concord, partly from our national moderation, and partly from the wi&s;dom and &s;ometimes perhaps from the carele&s;sne&s;s of our mini&s;ters, they have been tru&s;ted in a good mea&s;ure with the entire manage|ment of their affairs: and the &s;ucce&s;s they have met with ought to be to us an ever memorable proof, that the true art of government con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>not governing too much.</HI> And why &s;hould friend&s;hip and gratitude, and long at|tachments, which in&s;pire all the reli&s;h and &s;weetne&s;s of private life, be &s;uppo&s;ed to be of no weight in the intercour&s;e between great communities? The&s;e are principles of human nature, which act with much greater certainty on numbers than on individuals. If properly cultivated they may to us be productive of the noble&s;t benefits; and at all events, will neither le&s;&s;en the extent of our power, nor &s;horten the duration of it.</P>
<P>When things are on &s;o rea&s;onable a footing, if there &s;hould happen to be any errors in government, they will &s;oon be corrected by the friendly di&s;po&s;ition of the people; and the endeavours to &s;eparate the intere&s;t of the colo|nies from that of Great Britain will be received with the indignation, that is due to the artifices of <HI>factious men, who wi&s;h to grow eminent by the misfortunes of their country.</HI></P>
<P>Even in that future &s;tate of independency, which &s;ome among&s;t them ignorantly wi&s;h for, but which for their true intere&s;t can never be too long delayed; the old and prudent will often look back on their pre&s;ent happi|ne&s;s with regret; and con&s;ider the peace and &s;ecurity, the &s;tate of vi&s;ible improvement, and brotherly equality, which they enjoyed under the protection of their mother country, as the true golden age of America.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013009_0012_0F8FB14632FC5A58">
I need not &s;ugge&s;t how favourable tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions mu&s;t prove to the reception of the religious and benevo|lent doctrines which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of this Society to propagate. Under a mutual inclination to peace and good will, the le&s;&s;ons of piety we teach will be heard with that fair attention which always turns to the advan|tage of truth; and the claims we will make will be e&s;timated (which is all we ought to de&s;ire) by the rea&s;on|ablene&s;s of them.</P>
<P>I own I feel upon my mind a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of the publick advantages that would re&s;ult from this bene|volent and chri&s;tian policy; and I could wi&s;h for the intere&s;t of mankind, and of our country in particular, that it may not be thought wholly of a vi&s;ionary nature. I think I can &s;ee a &s;trong and immediate demand upon us for &s;uch a conduct from the &s;ituation we are in, and the unu&s;ual occurrences that have pa&s;&s;ed before us within <HI>a few years.</HI> There &s;eems at pre&s;ent to be a great and ge|neral commotion, and tendency to change in the minds of men. Animated by the gradual improvement of know|ledge, and the fortunate example of this country, our neighbours have had the courage to think with greater freedom on the mo&s;t important &s;ubjects, and to look for &s;omething better in religion and government, than they find e&s;tabli&s;hed among them&s;elves. And even in this land of liberty, where we have been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t &s;olid and valuable truths, the &s;pirit of en|quiry is &s;till at work, and urging it's pur&s;uits with a dangerous freedom, that ri&s;ks more than it can hope to gain. At the &s;ame time not only di&s;content and faction, but the real difficulties of things, the extent, the fluctua|tion and the intricacies of commerce afford &s;ufficient ex|erci&s;e for political wi&s;dom. Add to this a va&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of di&s;tant territory, the art of governing which we are <HI>yet to learn.</HI> Our colonies are ri&s;ing into &s;tates and nations. The extreme boundaries of the world are
<PB N="13" REF="013009_0013_0F8FB146F0655BC8">
opening to our view; and regions, unknown to our fathers, may &s;oon become the objects of contention. In this great &s;hifting &s;cene of human affairs, the concerns of this exten&s;ive empire are growing every year into more importance and dignity. It behoves us to adopt &s;ome plan of conduct, that &s;hall be &s;uitable to our &s;itua|tion and the high character we &s;u&s;tain. The intere&s;t of Britain, con&s;idered &s;ingly by it&s;elf, ought not at pre&s;ent to be the &s;ole; and in a few ages may not be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable object of attention. <HI>We have already tried what advantage is to be found in governing by force, and have no rea&s;on to be proud of the experiment.</HI> What benefit has accrued to the publick from the plunder and de&s;olation of an indu&s;trious helple&s;s people? The whole profit, we have reaped from &s;o much inju&s;tice and di&s;|honour, has ended in fraudulent &s;chemes, vain and extravagant expectations, ruinous expence and luxury; attended with a general lo&s;s of credit and confidence, a &s;udden &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of commerce and indu&s;try, and an almo&s;t total &s;toppage of the main &s;prings and vital mo|tions of &s;ociety. It requires no common degree of wi&s;dom to deliver our country from &s;uch gains and &s;uch pro&s;perity as this!</P>
<P><HI>A great liberal commanding &s;pirit is wanting;</HI> &s;uch as has appeared but rarely in modern times, but was better known to the ancients; which, without com|puting and calculating what is &s;trictly due, can extort affection and gratitude by publick &s;ervices; which can &s;acrifice little and even great intere&s;ts to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a &s;olid permanent authority, founded on ju&s;tice and moderation: which permitting it's &s;ubjects to enjoy and improve all their natural advantages, can always avail it&s;elf of their wealth and numbers for the defence or the glory of the empire; <HI>and is &s;ure to find the mo&s;t powerful re&s;ources of government in their friend|&s;hip and love.</HI></P>

We pre&s;ume not to in&s;truct our rulers in the mea&s;ures of government: but it is the proper office of a preacher of the go&s;pel of peace, to point out the laws of ju&s;tice and equity which mu&s;t ultimately regulate the happine&s;s of &s;tates as well as of individuals: and which are no other in effect than tho&s;e benevolent chri&s;tian morals which it is the province of this Society to teach transferred from the duties of private life to the admini&s;tration of publick affairs. In fact, by what bond of union &s;hall we hold together the members of this great empire, di&s;per&s;ed and &s;cattered as they be over the face of the earth? No <HI>power</HI> can be &s;wift or exten&s;ive enough to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. Some art mu&s;t be employed to intere&s;t all the di&s;tant parts in the pre&s;ervation of the whole; which can only be effected by &s;erving&punc; obliging and protecting them. It ought not to be the fir&s;t object in contemplation, what we are to get by them; but how we can be&s;t improve, a&s;&s;i&s;t and reward them; by what benefits we may pro|cure their happine&s;s and win their affection. But is government then intitled to no emoluments in recompence for all its cares? I an&s;wer, that they who have the heart to do good to tho&s;e who depend upon them&punc; will always meet with an ample return. None are &s;o &s;ure to reap the benefits of the &s;oil, as they who have &s;pared no ex|pence in the cultivation. And it is univer&s;ally true, that the more we exact from our &s;ubjects, the le&s;s we &s;hall gain from them. <Q>BOUNTIFULNESS IS A PLENTI|FUL GARDEN, AND MERCIFULNESS ENDURETH FOR EVER.</Q> Let the di&s;tant nations, that depend upon us, be made to know and feel that they owe their peace and happine&s;s to our protection. Let them be encouraged to con&s;ider them&s;elves not as our &s;laves, but as our friends and brethren. And let us endeavour to wipe away the tears from the poor oppre&s;&s;ed natives of India; and &s;uffer them, if po&s;&s;ible, to enjoy &s;ome ta&s;te of the legal &s;ecurity and civil liberty, which renders life dear

to our&s;elves; which are ble&s;&s;ings hitherto unknown to tho&s;e climates, but more grateful to the heart of man&punc; than all the fruits and odours which nature has lavi&s;hed upon them.</P>
<P>This righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy, which is due to all men&punc; but e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are under our protection, is the law of nature, the command of religion, and it ought to be the fir&s;t and leading maxim of civil policy. But it is amazing how &s;lowly in all countries the principles of natural ju&s;tice, which are &s;o evidently nece&s;&s;ary in private life, have been admitted into the admini&s;tration of pub|lick affairs. Not many ages ago, it was cu&s;tomary to engage in war without a rea&s;onable cau&s;e or provocation, and to carry it on without humanity or mercy. Since then, it is happily become nece&s;&s;ary for &s;tates to explain their motives, and ju&s;tify their conduct, before they begin to de&s;troy their fellow-creatures. And ble&s;&s;ed be his memory who fir&s;t taught the &s;oldier to &s;pare the u&s;eful hu&s;band-man, and to feel a horror at the &s;hedding of innocent blood.</P>
<P>It has been the policy of government, &s;uch as it is, from the earlie&s;t times, to keep di&s;tant provinces and colonies under the mo&s;t &s;evere re&s;traints and &s;ubjection. Yet when tho&s;e re&s;traints have been removed, the mo|ther-country has always been a great gainer by the advantages &s;he has communicated to her &s;ubjects. In|deed it is a truth, not more important than it is evident and obvious, that the mo&s;t &s;ure and effectual method of receiving good from men is to do good to them; or, as St. Paul beautifully expre&s;&s;es it, <Q>TO PROVOKE ONE ANOTHER TO GOOD WORKS.</Q> But the minds of men are not &s;ufficiently prepared and enlightened by ex|perience to adopt it in practice. <HI>A time, I doubt not will come.</HI> in the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of human affairs, when the checks and re&s;traints we lay on the indu&s;try
<PB N="16" REF="013009_0016_0F8FB14C37C586E0">
of our fellow-&s;ubjects, and the jealou&s;ies we conceive at their pro&s;perity, will be con&s;idered as the effects of a mi&s;taken policy, prejudicial to all parties, but chiefly to our&s;elves. It would be a noble effort of virtuous am|bition to anticipate this di&s;covery; to break through the prejudices and &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit of the age; to find a better path to our true intere&s;t; and to make our country great, and powerful, and rich, not by force or fraud, but by ju&s;tice, friend&s;hip and humanity.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have dwelt &s;o long on &s;o unu&s;ual a &s;ubject, had it not been for the great and almo&s;t infinite impor|tance of it. The virtue of a private man a&s;&s;i&s;ts and &s;upports a few individuals; but this publick virtue does good to thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands. The former relieves the di&s;tre&s;s of a friend, or of a family: the latter acts in a higher &s;phere; it founds &s;tates and kingdoms, or makes them pro&s;perous and happy. Yet all this merit, which a nation can never &s;ufficiently acknowledge, at lea&s;t all that we pre&s;ume to de&s;cribe, con&s;i&s;ts in the right application of the plain good rules, which are &s;o often tepeated to us in &s;cripture; <Q>WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO UNTO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO UNTO THEM. FOLLOW THAT WHICH IS GOOD TO ALL MEN. LOOK NOT EVERY MAN ON HIS OWN THINGS, BUT EVERY MAN ALSO ON THE THINGS OF OTHERS. BEAR YE ONE ANOTHER'S BURTHENS, AND SO FUL|FIL THE LAW OF CHRIST.</Q> But the&s;e truths lie before the eyes of men, like medicinal herbs in the open field; and for want of applying them to their proper objects, they remain ignorant of their virtues. Yet we may &s;ay, with a pious confidence, that this has not been our own ca&s;e. This Society has thought that we could not obey the&s;e divine precepts in a manner more agreeable to the true &s;pirit of them, than by
<PB N="17" REF="013009_0017_0F8FB14CF133BBD0">
teaching to di&s;tant nations the truths that are be&s;t cal|culated to make them happy. Could we teach them to the great and the wi&s;e of this world, that would be happine&s;s indeed; that would be the mo&s;t effectual and the mo&s;t beneficial Propagation of the Go&s;pel, that the world has yet &s;een. Mankind would then have an ex|perimental proof of the &s;alvation offered to us from above; and would acknowledge with gratitude the propriety of that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from Heaven. <Q>GLORY BE TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST, ON EARTH PEACE, GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN.</Q></P>
