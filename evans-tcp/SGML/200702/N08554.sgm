<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF RASSELAS, PRINCE OF ABISSINIA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. De&s;cription of a palace in a valley.</HEAD>
<P>YE who li&s;ten with credulity to the whi&s;|pers of fancy, and pur&s;ue with eager|ne&s;s the phantoms of hope; who expect that age will perform the promi&s;es of youth, and that the deficiencies of the pre&s;ent day will be &s;upplied by the morrow; attend to the hi&s;tory of Ra&s;&s;elas prince of Abi&s;&s;inia.</P>
<P>Ra&s;&s;elas was the fourth &s;on of the mighty emperor, in who&s;e dominions the Father of waters begins his cour&s;e; who&s;e bounty pours down the &s;treams of plenty, and &s;catters over half the world the harve&s;ts of Egypt.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010939_0009_0F852A7446BE6120">
According to the cu&s;tom which has de|&s;cended from age to age among the monarchs of the torrid zone, he was confined in a private palace, with the other &s;ons and daughters of Abi&s;&s;inian royalty, till the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould call him to the throne.</P>
<P>The place, which the wi&s;dom or policy of antiquity had de&s;tined for the re&s;idence of the Ab&s;&s;inian princes, was a &s;pacious valley in the kingdom of Amh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ra, &s;urrounded on every &s;ide by mountains, of which the &s;ummits overhang the middle part. The only pa&s;|&s;age, by which it could be entered, was a cavern that pa&s;&s;ed under a rock, of which it has long been di&s;puted whether it was the work of nature or of human indu&s;try. The outlet of the cavern was concealed by a thick wood, and the mouth which opened into the valley was clo&s;ed with gates of iron, forged by the the artificers of ancient days, &s;o ma&s;&s;y that no man could, without the help of engines, open or &s;hut them.</P>
<P>From the mountains on every &s;ide, rivulets de&s;cended that filled all the valley with verdure and fertility, and formed a lake in the middle inhabited by fi&s;h of every &s;pecies, and frequent|ed by every fowl whom nature has taught to dip the wing in water. This lake di&s;charged its &s;uperfluities by a &s;tream which entered a
<PB N="9" REF="010939_0010_0F852A746491D4E8">
dark cleft of the mountain on the northern &s;ide, and fell with dreadful noi&s;e from precipice to precipice till it was heard no more.</P>
<P>The &s;ides of the mountains were covered with trees, the banks of the brooks were di|ver&s;ified with flowers; every bla&s;t &s;hook &s;pices from the rocks, and every month dropped fruits upon the ground. All Animals that bite the gra&s;s, or brou&s;e the &s;hrub, whether wild or tame, wandered in this exten&s;ive cir|cuit, &s;ecured from bea&s;ts of prey by the mountains which confined them. On one part were flocks and herds feeding in the pa&s;tures, on another all the bea&s;ts of chace fri&s;king in the lawns; the &s;prightly kid was bounding on rocks, the &s;ubtle monkey fro|licking in the trees, and the &s;olemn elephant repo&s;ing in the &s;hade. All the diver&s;ities of the world were brought together, the ble&s;&s;ings of nature were collected, and its evils extrac|ted and excluded.</P>
<P>The valley, wide and fruitful, &s;upplied its inhabitants with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and all delights and &s;uperfluities were added at the annual vi&s;it which the emperor paid his chil|dren, when the iron gate was opened to the &s;ound of mu&s;ick; and during eight days every one that re&s;ided in the valley was required to propo&s;e whatever might contribute to make
<PB N="10" REF="010939_0011_0F852A75185F8C38">
&s;eclu&s;ion plea&s;ant, to fill up the vacancies of attention, and le&s;&s;en the tediou&s;ne&s;s of time. Every de&s;ire was immediately granted. All the artificers of plea&s;ure were called to glad|den the fe&s;tivity; the mu&s;icians exerted the power of harmony, and the dancers &s;hewed their activity before the prince&s;s, in hope that they &s;hould pa&s;s their lives in this bli&s;sful captivity, to which the&s;e only were admitted who&s;e performance was thought able to add novelty to luxury. Such was the appearance of &s;ecurity and delight which this retirement afforded, that they to whom it was new always de&s;ired that it might be perpetual; and as tho&s;e on whom the iron gate had once clo&s;ed were never &s;uffer'd to return, the effect of longer experience could not be known. Thus every year produced new &s;chemes of delight, and new competitors for impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>The palace &s;tood on an eminence, rai&s;ed about thirty paces above the &s;urface of the lake. It was divided into many &s;quares or courts, built with greater or le&s;s magnificence, according to the rank of tho&s;e for whom they were de&s;igned. The roofs were turned into arches of ma&s;&s;y &s;tone, joined with a cement that grew harder by time, and the building &s;tood from century to century, deriding the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rains and equinoctial hurricanes, with|out need of reparation.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010939_0012_0F852A7B2410B638">
This hou&s;e, which was &s;o large as to be fully known to none but &s;ome ancient officers, who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively inherited the &s;ecrets of the place, was built as if &s;u&s;picion her&s;elf had dictated the plan. To every room there was an open and &s;ecret pa&s;&s;age, every &s;quare had a communication with the re&s;t, either from the upper &s;tories by private galleries, or by &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;ages from the lower apart|ments. Many of the columns had un&s;u&s;pected cavities, In which &s;ucce&s;&s;ive monarchs repo|&s;ited their trea&s;ures. They then clo&s;ed up the opening with marble, which was never to be removed but in the utmo&s;t exigencies of the kingdom; and recorded their accumu|lations in a book which was it&s;elf concealed in a tower not entered but by the emperor, attended by the prince who &s;tood next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The di&s;content of Ra&s;&s;elas in the happy valley.</HEAD>
<P>HERE the &s;ons and daughters of Abi&s;&s;inia lived only to know the &s;oft vici&s;&s;itudes of plea&s;ure and repo&s;e, attended by all that were &s;kilful to delight and gratified with what|ever the &s;en&s;es can enjoy. They wandered in gardens of fragrance, and &s;lept in the fortre&s;&s;es
<PB N="12" REF="010939_0013_0F852A7D2B09AF58">
of &s;ecurity. Every art was practi&s;ed to make them plea&s;ed with their own condition. The &s;ages who in&s;tructed them, told them of noth|ing but the mi&s;eries of publick life, and de&s;|cribed all beyond the mountains as regions of calamity, where di&s;cord was always raging, and where man preyed upon man.</P>
<P>To heighten their opinion of their own feli|city, they were daily entertained with &s;ongs, the &s;ubject of which was the <HI>happy valley.</HI> Their appetites were excited by frequent enumera|tions of different enjoyments, and revelry and merriment was the bu&s;ine&s;s of every hour from the dawn of morning to the clo&s;e of evening.</P>
<P>The&s;e methods were generally &s;ucce&s;sful; few of the princes had ever wi&s;hed to enlarge their bounds, but pa&s;&s;ed their lives in full conviction that they had all within their reach that art or nature could be&s;tow, and pitied tho&s;e whom fate had excluded from this &s;eat of tranquillity, as the &s;port of chance, and the &s;laves of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Thus they ro&s;e in the morning, and lay down at night, plea&s;ed with each other and with them&s;elves, all but Ra&s;&s;elas, who, in the twenty-&s;ixth year of his age, began to withdraw him&s;elf from their pa&s;times and
<PB N="13" REF="010939_0014_0F852A7D8EBC9D10">
a&s;&s;emblies, and to delight in &s;olitary walks and &s;ilent meditation. He often &s;at before tables covered with luxury, and forgot to ta&s;te the dainties that were placed before him: he ro&s;e abruptly, in the mid&s;t of the &s;ong and ha&s;tily retired beyond the &s;ound of mu&s;ick. His attendants ob&s;erved the change, and endea|voured to renew his love of plea&s;ure: he neglected their endeavours, repul&s;ed their in|vitations, and &s;pent day after day on the banks of rivulets &s;heltered with trees, where he &s;ometimes li&s;tened to the birds in the branches, &s;ometimes ob&s;erved the fi&s;h playing in the &s;tream, and anon ca&s;t his eyes upon the pa&s;tures and mountains filled with animals, of which &s;ome were biting the herbage, and &s;ome &s;leeping among the bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>This &s;ingularity of his humour made him much ob&s;erved. One of the &s;ages, in who&s;e conver&s;ation he had formerly delighted, fol|lowed him &s;ecretly, in hope of di&s;covering the cau&s;e of his di&s;quiet. Ra&s;&s;elas, who knew not that any one was near him, having for &s;ome time fixed his eyes upon the goats that were brou&s;ing among the rocks, began to compare their condition with his own.</P>
<P>"What," &s;aid he, "makes the difference between man and all the re&s;t of the animal creation? Every bea&s;t that &s;trays be&s;ide me has
<PB N="14" REF="010939_0015_0F852A7E1460FAE0">
the &s;ame corporeal nece&s;&s;ities with my&s;elf; he is hungry and crops the gra&s;s, he is thir&s;ty and drinks the &s;tream, his thir&s;t and hunger are appea&s;ed, he is &s;atisfied and &s;leeps; he ri&s;es again and is hungry, he is again fed and is at re&s;t. I am hungry and thir&s;ty like him, but when thir&s;t and hunger cea&s;e I am not at re&s;t; I am like him pained with want, but am not, like him, &s;atisfied with fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The intermediate hours are tedious and gloomy; I long again to be hungry that I may again quicken my attention. The birds peck the berries or the corn, and fly away to the groves where they &s;it in &s;eeming happine&s;s on the branches, and wa&s;te their lives in tuning one unvaried &s;eries of &s;ounds. I likewi&s;e can call the lutani&s;t and the &s;inger, but the &s;ounds that plea&s;ed me ye&s;terday weary me to|day, and will grow yet more weari&s;ome to|morrow. I can di&s;cover within me no power of perception which is not glutted with its proper plea&s;ure, yet I do not feel my&s;elf de|lighted. Man has &s;urely &s;ome latent &s;en&s;e for which this place affords no gratification, or he has &s;ome de&s;ires di&s;tinct from &s;en&s;e, which mu&s;t be &s;atisfied before he can be happy."</P>
<P>After this he lifted up his head, and &s;eeing the moon ri&s;ing, walked towards the palace. As he pa&s;&s;ed through the fields, and &s;aw the animals around him, "Ye, &s;aid he, are hap|py,
<PB N="15" REF="010939_0016_0F852A7ED78291E8">
and need not envy me that walk thus among you, burthened with my&s;elf; nor do I, ye gentle beings, envy your felicity; for it is not the felicity of man. I have many di&s;tre&s;&s;es from which ye are free; I fear pain when I do not feel it; I &s;ometimes &s;hrink at evils recol|lected, and &s;ometimes &s;tart at evils anticipated: &s;urely the equity of providence has ballanced peculiar &s;ufferings with peculiar enjoyments."</P>
<P>With ob&s;ervations like the&s;e the prince amu&s;ed him&s;elf as he returned, uttering them with a plaintive voice, yet with a look that di&s;covered him to feel &s;ome complacence in his own per&s;picacity, and to receive &s;ome &s;olace of the mi&s;eries of life, from con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the delicacy with which he felt, and the elo|quence with which he bewailed them. He mingled chearfully in the diver&s;ions of the evening, and all rejoiced to find that his heart was lightened.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The wants of him that wants nothing.</HEAD>
<P>ON the next day his old in&s;tructor, ima|gining that he had now made him&s;elf acquainted with his di&s;ea&s;e of mind, was in hope of curing it by coun&s;el, and officiou&s;ly &s;ought an opportunity of a conference, which
<PB N="16" REF="010939_0017_0F852A7F95067A10">
the prince was not very willing to afford, hav|ing long con&s;idered him as one who&s;e intellects were exhau&s;ted: "Why, &s;aid he, does this man thus intrude upon me; &s;hall I be never &s;uffered to forget tho&s;e lectures which plea&s;ed only while they were new, and to become new again mu&s;t be forgotten;" He then walked into the wood, and compo&s;ed him&s;elf to his u&s;ual meditations; when before his thoughts had taken any &s;ettled form, he per|ceived his pur&s;uer at his &s;ide, and was at fir&s;t prompted by his impatience to go ha&s;tily away; but, being unwilling to offend a man whom he had once reverenced and &s;till loved, he invited him to &s;it down with him on the bank.</P>
<P>The old man, thus encouraged, began to lament the change which had been lately ob|&s;erved in the prince, and to enquir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> why he &s;o often retired from the plea&s;ures of the pa|lace, to loneline&s;s and &s;ilence. "I fly from plea&s;ure, &s;aid the prince becau&s;e plea&s;ure has cea&s;ed to plea&s;e; I am lonely becau&s;e I am mi&s;erable, and am unwilling to cloud with my pre&s;ence the happine&s;s of others. "You, Sir, &s;aid the &s;age, are the fir&s;t who, has complained of mi&s;ery in the <HI>happy valley.</HI> I hope to convince you that your complaints have no real cau&s;e. You are here in full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that the emperor of Abi&s;&s;inia can
<PB N="17" REF="010939_0018_0F852A805B6EEB30">
be&s;tow; here is neither labour to be endured, nor danger to be dreaded, yet here is all that labour or danger can procure. Look round and tell me which of your wants is without &s;upply: if you want nothing, how are you un|happy?"</P>
<P>"That I want nothing, &s;aid the prince, or that I know not what I want, is the cau&s;e of my complaint; if I had any known want, I &s;hould have a certain wi&s;h; that wi&s;h would excite endeavour, and I &s;hould not then repine to &s;ee the &s;un move &s;o &s;lowly towards the we&s;t|ern mountain, or lament when the day breaks and &s;leep will no longer hide me from my|&s;elf. When I &s;ee the kids and the lambs cha&s;ing one another, I fancy that I &s;hould be happy if I had &s;omething to pur&s;ue. But, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all that I can want, I find one day and one hour exactly like another, except that the latter is &s;till more tedious than the former. Let your experience inform me how the day may now &s;eem as &s;hort as in my childhood, while nature was yet fre&s;h, and every moment &s;hewed me what I never had ob&s;erved before. I have already enjoyed too much; give me &s;omething to de&s;ire."</P>
<P>The old man was &s;urpri&s;ed at this new &s;pecies of affliction, and knew not what to reply, yet was unwilling to be &s;ilent, "Sir, &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he,

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The prince continues to grieve and mu&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>AT this time the &s;ound of mu&s;ick pro|claimed the hour of repa&s;t, and the conver&s;ation was concluded. The old man went away &s;ufficiently di&s;contented to find that his rea&s;onings had produced the only conclu&s;ion which they were intended to prevent. But in the decline of life, &s;hame and grief are of &s;hort duration; whether it be that we bear ea&s;ily what we have borne long, or that, finding our|&s;elves in age le&s;s regarded, we le&s;s regard others; or, that we look with &s;light regard upon afflictions, to which we know that the hand of death is about to put an end.</P>
<P>The prince, who&s;e views were extended to a wider &s;pace, could not &s;peedily quiet his emotions. He had been before terrified at the length of life which nature promi&s;ed him, becau&s;e he con&s;idered that in a long time much mu&s;t be endured; he now rejoiced in his youth, becau&s;e in many years much might be done.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010939_0020_0F852A82007F2AB0">
This fir&s;t beam of hope, that had been ever darted into his mind, rekindled youth in his cheeks, and doubled the lu&s;tre of his eyes. He was fired with the de&s;ire of doing &s;ome|thing, tho' he knew not yet with di&s;tinctne&s;s, either end or means.</P>
<P>He was now no longer gloomy and un&s;ocial; but, con&s;idering him&s;elf as ma&s;ter of a &s;ecret &s;tock of happine&s;s, which he could enjoy only by concealing it, he affected to be bu&s;y in all &s;chemes of diver&s;ion, and endeavoured to make others plea&s;ed with the &s;tate of which he him|&s;elf was weary. But plea&s;ures never can be &s;o multiplied or continued, as not to leave much of life unemployed; there were many hours, both of the night and day, which he could &s;pend without &s;u&s;picion in &s;olitary thought. The load of life was much light|ened: he went eagerly into the a&s;&s;emblies, becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;ed the frequency of his pre|&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of his purpo&s;es; he retired gladly to privacy, becau&s;e he had now a &s;ubject of thought.</P>
<P>His chief amu&s;ement was to picture to him|&s;elf that world which he had never &s;een; to place him&s;elf in various conditions; to be entangled in imaginary difficulties, and to be engaged in wild adventures: but his bene|volence always terminated his projects in the
<PB N="20" REF="010939_0021_0F852A829A574D28">
relief of di&s;tre&s;s, the detection of fraud, the defeat of oppre&s;&s;ion, and the diffu&s;ion of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed twenty months of the life of Ra&s;&s;elas. He bu&s;ied him&s;elf &s;o inten&s;ely in vi&s;ionary bu&s;tle, that he forgot his real &s;oli|tude; and, amid&s;t hourly preparations for the various incidents of human affairs, neglected to con&s;ider by what means he &s;hould mingle with mankind.</P>
<P>One day as he was &s;itting on a bank, he feigned to him&s;elf an orphan virgin robbed of her little portion by a treacherous lover, and crying after him for re&s;titution and re|dre&s;s. So &s;trongly was the image impre&s;&s;ed upon his mind, that he &s;tarted up in the maid's defence, and ran forwards to &s;eize the plun|derer with all the eagerne&s;s of real pur&s;uit. Fear naturally quickens the flight of guilt. Ra&s;&s;elas could not catch the fugitive with his utmo&s;t efforts; but re&s;olving to weary, by per&s;everance, him whom he could not &s;urpa&s;s in &s;peed, he pre&s;&s;ed on till the foot of the mountain &s;topped his cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Here he recollected him&s;elf, and &s;miled at his own u&s;ele&s;s impetuo&s;ity. Then rai&s;ing his eyes to the mountain, "This, &s;aid he, is the fatal ob&s;tacle that hinders at once the
<PB N="21" REF="010939_0022_0F852A8362F65910">
enjoyment of plea&s;ure, and the exerci&s;e of virtue. How long is it that my hopes and wi&s;hes have flown beyond this boundary of my life, which yet I never have attempted to &s;urmount!"</P>
<P>Struck with this reflection he &s;at down to mu&s;e, and remembered, that &s;ince he fir&s;t re&s;ol|ved to e&s;cape from his confinement, the &s;un had pa&s;&s;ed twice over him in his annual cour&s;e. He now felt a degree, of regret with which he had never before been acquainted. He con&s;idered how much might have been done in the time which had pa&s;&s;ed and left nothing real be|hind it. He compaired twenty months with the life of man. "In life, &s;aid he, is not to be counted the ignorance of infancy, or imbecillity of age. We are long before we are able to think, and we &s;oon cea&s;e from the power of acting. The true period of human exi&s;tence may be rea&s;onably e&s;timated at forty years, of which I have mu&s;ed away the four and twentieth part. What I have lo&s;t was certain, for I have certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it; but of twenty months to come who can a&s;&s;ure me?"</P>
<P>The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own folly pierced him deeply, and he was long before he could be reconciled to him&s;elf. "The re&s;t of my time, &s;aid he, has been lo&s;t by the crime or
<PB N="22" REF="010939_0023_0F852A8413B4E048">
folly of my ance&s;tors, and the ab&s;urd in&s;titu|tions of my country; I remember it with di&s;gu&s;t, but without remor&s;e: but the months that have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince new light darted into my &s;oul, &s;ince I formed a &s;cheme of rea&s;onable felicity, have been &s;quandered by my own fault. I have lo&s;t that which can never be re&s;tored. I have &s;een the &s;un ri&s;e and &s;et for twenty months an idle gazer on the light of heaven: In this time the birds have left the ne&s;t of their mother, and committed them&s;elves to the woods and to the &s;kies: the kid has for&s;aken the teat, and learned by degrees to climb the rocks in que&s;t of independant &s;u&s;|tenance. I only have made no advances, but am &s;till helple&s;s and ignorant. The moon, by more than twenty changes, admoni&s;hed me of the flux of life; the &s;tream that rolled be|fore my feet upbraided my inactivity. I &s;at fea&s;ting on intellectual luxury, regardle&s;s alike of the examples of the earth, and the in&s;truc|tions of the planets. Twenty months are pa&s;t, who &s;hall re&s;tore them!"</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;orrowful meditations fa&s;tened upon his mind; he pa&s;t four months in re&s;olving to lo&s;e no more time in idle re&s;olves, and was awakened to more vigorous exertion by hear|ing a maid, who had broken a porcelain cup, remark, that what cannot be repaired is not to be regretted.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="010939_0024_0F852A84F3F233D8">
This was obvious; and Ra&s;&s;elas reproached him&s;elf that he had not di&s;covered it, having not known, or not con&s;idered, how many u&s;e|ful hints are obtained by chance, and how of|ten the mind, hurried by her own ardour to di&s;tant views, neglects the truths that lie open before her. He, for a few hours, regretted his regret, and from that time bent his whole mind upon the means of e&s;caping from the valley of happine&s;s.</P>

<P>HE now found that it would be very dif|ficult to effect that which it was very ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e effected. When he looked round about him, he &s;aw him&s;elf confined by the bars of nature which had never yet been broken, and by the gate, through which none that once had pa&s;&s;ed, were ever able to return. He was now impatient as an eagle in a grate. He pa&s;&s;ed week after week in clambering the the mountains, to &s;ee if there was any aper|ture which the bu&s;hes might conceal, but found all the &s;ummits inacce&s;&s;ible by their promi|nence. The iron gate he de&s;paired to open; for it was not only &s;ecured with all the power of art, but was always watched by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tinels, and was by its po&s;ition expo&s;ed
<PB N="24" REF="010939_0025_0F852A859FDF9778">
to the perpetual ob&s;ervation of all the inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>He then examined the cavern through which the waters of the lake were di&s;charged; and looking down at a time when the &s;un &s;hone &s;trongly upon its mouth, he di&s;cover'd it to be full of broken rocks, which, though they permitted the &s;tream to flow through many narrow pa&s;&s;ages, would &s;top any body of &s;olid bulk. He returned di&s;couraged and dejected; but, having now known the ble&s;&s;ing of hope re&s;olved never to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>In the&s;e fruitle&s;s re&s;earches he &s;pent ten months. The time, however, pa&s;&s;ed chearfully away: in the morning he ro&s;e with new hope, in the evening applauded his own diligence, and in the night &s;lept &s;ound after his fatigue. He met a thou&s;and amu&s;ements which beguiled his labour, and diver&s;ified his thoughts. He di&s;|cerned the various in&s;tincts of animals, and properties of plants, and found the place re|plete with wonders, of which he purpo&s;ed to &s;olace him&s;elf with the contemplation, if he &s;hould never be able to accompli&s;h his flight; rejoicing that his endeavours, though yet un|&s;ucce&s;sful, had &s;upplied him with a &s;ource of inexhau&s;tible enquiry.</P>

he re&s;olved to obtain &s;ome knowledge of the ways of men. His wi&s;h &s;till continued, but his hope grew le&s;s. He cea&s;ed to &s;urvey any longer the walls of his pri&s;on, and &s;pared to &s;earch by new toils for inter&s;tices which he knew could not be found, yet determined to keep his de&s;ign always in view, and lay hold on any expedient that time &s;hould offer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A di&s;&s;ertation on the art of flying.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the arti&s;ts that had been allured into the happy valley, to labour for the accomodation and plea&s;ure of its in|habitants, was a man, eminent for his know|ledge of the mechanick powers, who had con|trived many engines both of u&s;e and recrea|tion. By a wheel, which the &s;tream turned, he forced the water into a tower, whence it was di&s;tributed to all the apartments of the palace. He erected a pavillion in the garden, around which he kept the air always cool by artificial &s;howers. One of the groves, appropriated to the ladies, was ventilated by fans, to which the rivulet that ran through it, gave a con|&s;tant motion; and in&s;truments of &s;oft mu&s;ick were placed at proper di&s;tances, of which &s;ome played by the impul&s;e of the wind, and &s;ome by the power of the &s;tream.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="010939_0027_0F852A87187E4F38">
This arti&s;t was &s;ometimes vi&s;ited by Ra&s;&s;elas, who was plea&s;ed with every kind of knowledge, imagining that the time would come, when all his accqui&s;itions &s;hould be of u&s;e to him in the open world. He came one day to amu&s;e him&s;elf in his u&s;ual manner, and found the ma&s;ter bu&s;y in building a &s;ailing chariot: he &s;aw that the de&s;ign was practicable upon a level &s;urface, and with expre&s;&s;ions of great e&s;teem &s;olicited its completion. The workman was plea&s;ed to find him&s;elf &s;o much regarded by the prince, and re&s;olving to gain yet higher honours. "Sir, &s;aid he, you have &s;een but a &s;mall part of what the mechanick &s;ciences can perform. I have been long of opinion, that in&s;tead of the tardy conveyance of &s;hips and chariots, man might u&s;e the &s;wifter migration of wings; that the fields of air are open to knowledge, and that only ignorance and idle|ne&s;s need crawl upon the ground."</P>
<P>This hint rekindled the prince's de&s;ire of pa&s;&s;ing the mountains; and having &s;een what the mechani&s;t had already performed, he was willing to fancy that he could do more; yet re&s;olved to enquire further before he &s;uffered hope to afflict him by di&s;appointment. "I am afraid &s;aid he to the arti&s;t, that your ima|gination prevails over your &s;kill, and that
<PB N="27" REF="010939_0028_0F852A87D53CC868">
you now tell me rather what you wi&s;h than what you know. Every animal has his element a&s;|&s;igned him; the birds have the air, and men and bea&s;ts the earth." "So, replied the me|chani&s;t, fi&s;hes have the water, in which yet bea&s;ts can &s;wim by nature, and men by art. He that can &s;wim needs not de&s;pair to fly: to &s;wim is to fly in a gro&s;&s;er fluid, and to fly is to &s;wim in a &s;ubtiler. We are only to pro|portion our power of re&s;i&s;tance to the different den&s;ity of the matter through which we are to pa&s;s. You will be nece&s;&s;arily upborne by the air, if you can renew any impul&s;e upon it, fa&s;ter than the air can recede from the pre&s;|&s;ure."</P>
<P>"But the exerci&s;e of &s;wimming, &s;aid the prince, is very laborious, the &s;tronge&s;t limbs are &s;oon wearied; I am afraid the act of fly|ing will be yet more violent, and wings will be of no great u&s;e, unle&s;s we can fly further than we can &s;wim."</P>
<P>"The labour of ri&s;ing from the ground, &s;aid the arti&s;t will be great, as we &s;ee it in the heavier dome&s;tick fowls; but, as we mount higher the earth's attraction, and the body's gravity will be gradually dimini&s;hed, till we &s;hall arrive at a region where the man will float in the air without any tendency to fall: no care will then be nece&s;&s;ary, but to move forwards, which
<PB N="28" REF="010939_0029_0F852A8C5738FA10">
the gentle&s;t impul&s;e will effect. You, Sir, who&s;e curio&s;ity is &s;o exten&s;ive, will ea&s;ily con|ceive with what plea&s;ure a philo&s;pher, furni&s;hed with wings and hovering in the &s;ky, would &s;ee the earth, and all its inhabitants rolling be|neath him, and pre&s;enting to him &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by its diurnal motion, all the countries within the &s;ame parallel. How mu&s;t it amu&s;e the pendent &s;pectator to &s;ee the moving &s;cene of land and ocean, cities and de&s;arts! to &s;urvey with equal &s;ecurity the marts of trade, and the fields of battle, mountains infe&s;ted by barbarians, and fruitful regions gladdened by plenty, and lulled by peace! How ea&s;ily &s;hall we then trace the Nile through all his pa&s;&s;age; pa&s;s over to di&s;tant regions, and examine the face of nature from one extremity of the earth to the other!"</P>
<P>"All this, &s;aid the prince, is much to be de&s;ired, but I am afraid that no man will be able to breath in the&s;e regions of &s;peculation and tranquillity. I have been told that re|&s;piration is difficult upon lofty mountains, yet from the&s;e precipices, though &s;o high as to produce great tenuity of the air, it is very ea&s;y to fall; and I &s;u&s;pect, that from any height, where life can be &s;upported, there may be dan|ger of too quick de&s;cent."</P>
<P>"Nothing, replied the arti&s;t, will ever be

attempted, if all po&s;&s;ible objections mu&s;t be fir&s;t overcome. If you will favour my project, I will try the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light at my own hazard. I have con&s;idered the &s;tructure of all volant animals, and find the folding continuity of the bat's wings mo&s;t ea&s;ily accommodated to the hu|man form. Upon this model I &s;hall begin my ta&s;k to morrow, and in a year expect to tower into the air beyond the malice or pur|&s;uit of man. But I will work only on this condition, that the art &s;hall not be divulged, and that you &s;hall not require me to make wings for any but our&s;elves."</P>
<P>"Why, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, &s;hould you envy others &s;o great an advantage? All &s;kill ought to be exerted for univer&s;al good; every man has owed much to others, and ought to repay the kindne&s;s that he has received."</P>
<P>"If men were all virtuous, returned the arti&s;t, I &s;hould with great alacrity teach them all to fly. But what would be the &s;ecurity of the good, if the bad could at plea&s;ure in|vade them from the &s;ky? again&s;t an army &s;ailing through the clouds neither walls, nor mountains, nor &s;eas could afford any &s;ecurity. A flight of northern &s;avages might hover in the wind, and light at once with irre&s;i&s;tible vio|lence upon the capital of a fruitful region that was rolling under them. Even this valley,
<PB N="30" REF="010939_0031_0F852A8EB2C183D8">
the retreat of princes, the abode of happine&s;s, might be violated by the &s;udden de&s;cent of &s;ome of the naked nations, that &s;warm on the coa&s;t of the &s;outhern &s;ea."</P>
<P>The prince promi&s;ed &s;ecrecy, and waited for the performance, not wholly hopele&s;s of &s;uc|ce&s;s. He vi&s;ited the work from time to time, ob&s;erved its progre&s;s, and remarked the inge|nious contrivances to facilitate motion, and unite levity with &s;trength. The arti&s;t was every day more certain, that he &s;hould leave vultures and eagles behind him, and the contagion of his confidence &s;eized upon the prince.</P>
<P>In a year the wings were fini&s;hed, and, on a morning appointed, the maker appeared furni&s;hed for flight on a little promontory: he waved his pinions a while to gather air, then leaped from his &s;tand, and in an in&s;tant dropped into the lake. His wings which were of no u&s;e in the air, &s;u&s;tained him in the water, and the prince drew him to land, half dead with-terror and vexation.</P>

<P>THE prince was not much afflicted by this di&s;a&s;ter, having &s;uffered him&s;elf to

hope for a happier event, only becau&s;e he had no other means of e&s;cape in view. He &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign to leave the happy valley by the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>His imagination was now at a &s;tand; he had no pro&s;pect of entering into the world; and notwith&s;tanding all his endeavours to &s;upport him&s;elf, di&s;content by degrees preyed upon him, and he began again to lo&s;e his thoughts in &s;adne&s;s when the rainy &s;ea&s;on, which in the&s;e countries in periodical, made it inconvenient to wander in the woods.</P>
<P>The rain continued longer and with more violence than had been ever known: the clouds broke on the &s;urrounding mountains, and the torrents &s;treamed into the plain on every &s;ide, till the cavern was too narrow to di&s;charge the water. The lake overflowed its banks, and all the level of the valley was covered with the inundation. The eminence on which the palace was built, and &s;ome other &s;pots of ri&s;ing ground, were all that the eye could now di&s;cover. The herds and flocks left the pa&s;|tures, and both the wild bea&s;ts and the tame retreated to the mountains.</P>
<P>This inundation confined all the princes to dome&s;tick amu&s;ements, and the attention of Ra&s;&s;elas was particularly &s;eized by a poem,
<PB N="32" REF="010939_0033_0F852A9554048300">
which Imlac recited, upon the various conditi|ons of humanity. He commanded the poet to attend him in his apartment, and recite his ver&s;es a &s;econd time; then entering into fami|liar talk, he thought him&s;elf happy in having found a man who knew the world &s;o well, and co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;o &s;kilfully paint the &s;cenes of life. He a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions about things, to which, though common to all other mortals, his confinement from childhood had kept him a &s;tranger. The poet pitied his ignorance, and loved his curio&s;ity, and entertained him from day to day with novelty and in&s;truction, &s;o that the prince regretted the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;leep, and longed till the morning &s;hould re|new his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As they were &s;itting together, the prince commanded Imlac to relate his hi&s;tory, and to tell by what accident he was forced, or by what motive induced, to clo&s;e his life in the happy valley. As he was going to begin his narrative, Ra&s;&s;elas was called to a concert, and obliged to re&s;train his curio&s;ity till the evening.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The hi&s;tory of Imlac.</HEAD>
<P>THE clo&s;e of the day is, in the regions of the torrid zone, the only &s;ea&s;on of
<PB N="33" REF="010939_0034_0F852A956C40D798">
diver&s;ion and entertainment, and it was there|fore mid-night before the mu&s;ick cea&s;ed, and the prince&s;&s;es retired. Ra&s;&s;elas then called for his companion and required him to begin the &s;tory of his life.</P>
<P>"Sir, &s;aid Imlac, my hi&s;tory will not be long: the life that is devoted to knowledge pa&s;&s;es &s;ilently away, and is very little diver&s;i|fied by events. To talk in public, to think in &s;olitude, to read and to hear, to enquire, and an&s;wer inquires, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;cholar. He wanders about the world without pomp or terror, and is neither known nor valued but by men like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I was born in the kingdom of Goiama, at no great di&s;tance from the fountain of the Nile. My father was a wealthy merchant, and traded between the inland countries of Africk and the ports of the Red Sea. He was hone&s;t, frugal, and diligent, but of mean &s;entiments, and narrow comprehen&s;ion: he de&s;ired only to be rich, and to conceal his riches, le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;poiled by the governors of the pro|vince."</P>
<P>"Surely, &s;aid the prince, my father mu&s;t be negligent of his charge, if any man in his dominions dares take that which belongs to another. Does he not know that kings are
<PB N="34" REF="010939_0035_0F852A97352F0168">
accountable for inju&s;tice permitted as well as done? If I were emperor not the meane&s;t of my &s;ubjects &s;hould be oppre&s;&s;ed with impunity. My blood boils when I am told that a mer|chant dur&s;t not enjoy his hone&s;t gains, for fear of lo&s;ing by the rapacity of power. Name the governor who robbed the people, that I may declare his crimes to the emperor."</P>
<P>"Sir, &s;aid Imlac, your ardour is the na|tural effect of virtue animated by youth: the time will come when you will acquit your father, and perhaps hear with le&s;s impatience of the governor. Oppre&s;&s;ion is, in the Abi&s;|&s;inian dominions, neither frequent nor tolera|ted; but no form of government has been yet di&s;covered, by which cruelty can be wholly prevented. Subordination &s;uppo&s;es power on one part and &s;ubjection on the other; and if power be in the hands of men, it will &s;ome|times be abu&s;ed.

<P>"Why &s;aid the prince, did thy father de&s;ire the increa&s;e of his wealth, when it was already greater than he dur&s;t di&s;cover or enjoy? I am unwilling to doubt thy veracity, yet incon&s;i&s;t|encies cannot both be true."</P>
<P>"Incon&s;i&s;tencies, an&s;wered Imlac, cannot both be right, but, imputed to man, they may both be true. Yet diver&s;ity is not incon|&s;i&s;tency. My father might expect a time of greater &s;ecurity. However, &s;ome de&s;ire is nece&s;&s;ary to keep life in motion, and he, who&s;e real wants are &s;upplied, mu&s;t admit tho&s;e of fancy."</P>
<P>"This, &s;aid the prince, I can in &s;ome mea&s;ure conceive. I repent that I interrupted thee."</P>
<P>"With this hope, proceeded Imlac, he &s;ent me to &s;chool; but when I had once found the delight of knowledge, and felt the plea&s;ure of intelligence and the pride of invention, I be|gan &s;ilently to de&s;pi&s;e riches, and determined

to di&s;appoint the purpo&s;e of my father, who&s;e gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of conception rai&s;ed my pity.

As every hour taught me &s;omething new, I lived in a continual cour&s;e of gratifications; but, as I advanced towards manhood, I lo&s;t much of the reverence with which I had been u&s;ed to look on my in&s;tructors; becau&s;e, when the le&s;&s;on was ended, I did not find them wi&s;er or better than common men.</P>
<P>"At length my father re&s;olved to initiate me in commerce, and, opening one of his &s;ubterranean trea&s;uries, counted out ten thou|&s;and pieces of gold. This, young man, &s;aid he, is the &s;tock with which you mu&s;t nego|ciate. I began with le&s;s than the fifth part, and you &s;ee how diligence and par&s;imony have increa&s;ed it.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. The Hi&s;tory of Imlac continued.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t entered upon the world of waters, and lo&s;t &s;ight of land, I looked round about me with plea&s;ing terror, and thinking my &s;oul enlarged by the bound|le&s;s pro&s;pect, imagined that I could gaze round forever without &s;atiety; but, in a &s;hort time, I grew weary of looking on barren uniformity, where I could only &s;ee again what I had al|ready &s;een. I then de&s;cended into the &s;hip, and doubted for a while whether all my fu|ture plea&s;ures, would not end like this in di&s;|gu&s;t and di&s;appointment. Yet, &s;urely, &s;aid I, the ocean and the land are very different; the only variety of water is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t and motion, but the earth has mountains and vallies, de&s;arts and cities: it is inhabited by men of different cu&s;toms and contrary opinions; and I may hope to find variety in life, though I &s;hould mi&s;s it in nature.</P>
<P>"With this hope I quieted my mind, and amu&s;ed my&s;elf during the voyage; &s;ometimes by learning from the &s;ailors the art of naviga|tion, which I have never practi&s;ed, and &s;ome|times by forming &s;chemes for my conduct in different &s;ituations, in not one of which I have been ever placed.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="010939_0040_0F852A9AC0E10190">
"I was almo&s;t weary of my naval amu&s;ements when we landed &s;afely at Surat. I &s;ecured my money, and purcha&s;ing &s;ome commodities for &s;how, joined my&s;elf to a caravan that was pa&s;&s;ing into the inland country. My com|panions, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, conjecturing that I was rich, and by my inquiries and admiration, finding that I was ignorant, con&s;idered me as a novice whom they had a right to cheat, and who was to learn at the u&s;ual expence the art of fraud. They ex|po&s;ed me to the theft of &s;ervants, and exaction of officers, and &s;aw me plundered upon fal&s;e pretences, without any advantage to them&s;elves, but that of rejoicing in the &s;uperiority of their own knowledge."</P>
<P>"Stop a moment, &s;aid the prince, is there &s;uch depravity in man, as that he &s;hould injure another without benefit to him&s;elf? I can ea&s;ily conceive that all are plea&s;ed with &s;uperiority: but your ignorance was meerly accidental, which, being neither your crime nor your folly, could afford them no rea&s;on to applaud them|&s;elves; and the knowledge which they had, and which you wanted, they might as effect|ually have &s;hewn by warning you, as betraying you."</P>
<P>"Pride, &s;aid Imlac, is &s;eldom delicate, it will plea&s;e it&s;elf with very mean advantages;

and envy feels not its own happine&s;s, but when it may be compared with the mi&s;ery of others. They were my enemies becau&s;e they thought me rich, and my oppre&s;&s;ors, becau&s;e they de|lighted to find me weak."</P>
<P>"Proceed, &s;aid the prince: I doubt not of the facts which you relate, but imagine that you impute them to mi&s;taken motives."</P>
<P>"In this company, &s;aid Imlac, I arrived at Agra, the capital of Indo&s;tan, the city in which the great Mogul commonly re&s;ides. I applied my&s;elf to the language of the country, and in a few months was able to conver&s;e with the learned men; &s;ome of whom I found moro&s;e and re&s;erved, and others ea&s;y and communica|tive; &s;ome were unwilling to teach another, what they had with difficulty learned them|&s;elves; and &s;ome &s;hewed that the end of their &s;tudies was to gain the dignity of in&s;tructing.</P>
<P>"To the tutor of the young princes I re|commended my&s;elf &s;o much, that I was pre|&s;ented to the emperor as a man of uncommon knowledge. The emperor a&s;ked me many que&s;tions concerning my country and my tra|vels; and though I cannot now recollect any thing that he uttered above the power of a common man, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me, a&s;toni&s;hed at his wi&s;dom, and enamoured of his gooodne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="010939_0042_0F852A9C24D6C558">
"My credit was now &s;o high, that the mer|chants with whom I had travelled, applied to me for recommendations to the ladies of the court. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at their confidence of &s;olicitation, and gently reproached them with their practices on the road. They heard me with cold indifference, and &s;hewed no tokens of &s;hame or &s;orrow.</P>
<P>"They then urged their reque&s;t with the offer of a bribe; but what I would not do for kindne&s;s I would not do for money; and re|fu&s;ed them, not becau&s;e they had injured me, but becau&s;e I would not enable them to injure others; for I knew they would have made u&s;e of my credit to cheat tho&s;e who &s;hould buy their wares.</P>
<P>"Having re&s;ided at Agra, till there was no more to be learned, I travelled into Per&s;ia, where I &s;aw many remains of ancient magnifi|cence, and ob&s;erved many new accommodati|ons of life. The Per&s;ians are a nation emi|nently &s;ocial, and their a&s;&s;emblies afforded me daily opportunities of remarking characters and manners, and of tracing human nature through all its variations.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Imlac's hi&s;tory continued. A di&s;&s;ertation upon poetry.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREVER I went, I found that Poetry was con&s;idered as the highe&s;t learning, and regarded with a veneration &s;ome|what approaching to that which man would pay to the Angelick Nature. And it yet fills me with wonder, that, in almo&s;t all countries, the mo&s;t ancient poets are con&s;idered as the be&s;t: whether it be that every other kind of knowledge is an acqui&s;ition gradually attained, and poetry is a gift conferred at once; or that the fir&s;t poetry of every nation &s;urpri&s;ed them as a novelty, and retained the credit by con|&s;ent which it received by accident at fir&s;t: or whether the province of poetry is to de&s;cribe Nature and Pa&s;&s;ion, which are always the &s;ame, and the fir&s;t writers took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t &s;triking objects for de&s;cription, and the mo&s;t probable occurrences for fiction, and left no|thing, to tho&s;e that followed them, but tran|&s;cription of the &s;ame events, and new combi|nations of the &s;ame images. Whatever be the
<PB N="43" REF="010939_0044_0F852A9DA8CFB548">
rea&s;on, it is commonly ob&s;erved that the early writers are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of nature, and their fol|lowers of art: that the fir&s;t excel in &s;trength and invention, and the latter in elegance and refinement.</P>
<P>"I was de&s;irous to add my name to this illu&s;trious fraternity. I read all the poets of Per&s;ia and Arabia, and was able to repeat by memory the volumes that are &s;u&s;pended in the mo&s;que of Mecca. But I &s;oon found that no man was ever great by imitation. My de&s;ire of excellence impelled me to transfer my at|tention to nature and to life. Nature was to be my &s;ubject, and men to be my auditors: I could never de&s;cribe what I had not &s;een: I could not hope to move tho&s;e with delight or terror, who&s;e intere&s;ts and opinions I did not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Being now re&s;olved to be a poet, I &s;aw every thing with a new purpo&s;e; my &s;phere of atten|tion was &s;uddenly magnified: no kind of know|ledge was to be overlooked. I ranged moun|tains and de&s;erts for images and re&s;emblances, and pictured upon my mind every tree of the fore&s;t and flower of the valley. I ob&s;erved with equal care the crags of the rock and the pinnacles of the palace. Sometimes I wan|dered along the mazes of the rivulet, and &s;ome|times watched the changes of the &s;ummer clouds. To a poet nothing can be u&s;ele&s;s.

Whatever is beautiful, and whatever is dread|ful, mu&s;t be familiar to his imagination: he mu&s;t be conver&s;ant with all that is awfully va&s;t, or elegantly little. The plants of the garden, the animals of the wood, the minerals of the earth, and meteors of the &s;ky, mu&s;t all concur to &s;tore his mind with inexhau&s;tible variety: for every idea is u&s;eful for the inforcement or deco|ration of moral or religious truth; and he, who knows mo&s;t, will have mo&s;t power of diver&s;ify|ing his &s;cenes and of gratifying his reader with remote allu&s;ions and unexpected in&s;truction.</P>
<P>"All the appearances of nature I was there|fore careful to &s;tudy, and every country which I have &s;urveyed has contributed &s;omething to my poetical powers."</P>
<P>"In &s;o wide a &s;urvey, &s;aid the prince, you mu&s;t &s;urely have left much unob&s;erved. I have lived, till now, within the circuit of the&s;e mountains, and yet cannot walk abroad with|out the &s;ight of &s;omething which I had never beheld before, or never heeded."</P>
<P>"The bu&s;ine&s;s of a poet, &s;aid Imlac, is to examine, not the individual, but the &s;pecies; to remark general properties and large appear|ances: he does not number the &s;treaks of the tulip, or de&s;cribe the different &s;hades in the verdure of the fore&s;t He is to exhibit in his
<PB N="45" REF="010939_0046_0F852A9F1A1F9B58">
portraits of nature &s;uch prominent and &s;trik|ing features, as recal the original to every mind; and mu&s;t neglect the minuter di&s;crimi|nations which one may have remarked, and another have neglected, for tho&s;e characteri&s;|tics which are alike obvious to vigilance and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"But the knowledge of nature is only half the ta&s;k of a poet; he mu&s;t be acquainted likewi&s;e with all the modes of life. His cha|racter requires that he e&s;timate the happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of every condition; ob&s;erve the power of all the pa&s;&s;ions in all their combina|tions, and trace the changes of the human mind as they are modified by various in&s;tituti|ons and accidental influences of climate or cu|&s;tom, from the &s;prightline&s;s of infancy to the de&s;pondence of decrepitude. He mu&s;t dive&s;t him&s;elf of the prejudices of his age or coun|try; he mu&s;t con&s;ider right and wrong in their ab&s;tracted and invariable &s;tate; he mu&s;t di&s;re|gard pre&s;ent laws and opinions, and ri&s;e to ge|neral and tran&s;cendental truths, which will al|ways be the &s;ame: he mu&s;t therefore content him&s;elf with the &s;low progre&s;s of his name; and contemn the applau&s;e of his own time, and commit his claims to the ju&s;tice of po&s;te|rity. He mu&s;t write as the interpreter of na|ture, and the legi&s;lature of mankind, and con|&s;ider him&s;elf as pre&s;iding over the thoughts and

manners of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations; as a being &s;uperior to time and place. His labour is not yet at an end: he mu&s;t know many languages and many &s;ciences; and, that his &s;tile may be worthy of his thoughts, mu&s;t, by ince&s;&s;ant practice, familiarize to him&s;elf every delicacy of &s;peech and grace of harmony."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Imlac's narrative continued. A hint on pilgrimage.</HEAD>
<P>IMLAC now felt the enthu&s;ia&s;tic fit, and was proceeding to aggrandize his own pro|fe&s;&s;ion, when the prince cried out, "Enough! Thou ha&s;t convinced me, that no human be|ing can ever be a poet. Proceed now with thy narration."</P>
<P>"To be a poet, &s;aid Imlac, is indeed very difficult." "So difficult, returned the prince, that I will at pre&s;ent hear no more of his la|bours. Tell me whither you went when you had &s;een Arabia."</P>
<P>"From Arabia, &s;aid the poet, I travelled through Syria, and for three years re&s;ided in Pale&s;tine, where I conver&s;ed with great numbers of the northern and we&s;tern nations of Europe; the nations which are now in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="47" REF="010939_0048_0F852AA0944EDA40">
of all power and all knowledge; who&s;e armies are irre&s;i&s;tible, and who&s;e fleets com|mand the remote&s;t parts of the globe. When I compared the&s;e men with the natives of our own kingdom, and tho&s;e that &s;urround us, they appeared almo&s;t another order of beings. In their countries it is difficult to wi&s;h for any thing that may not be obtained: a thou&s;and arts, of which we never heard, are continually labouring for their convenience and plea&s;ure; and whatever their own climate has denied them, is &s;upplied by their commerce."</P>
<P>"By what means, &s;aid the prince, are the Europeans thus powerful? or why, &s;ince they can &s;o ea&s;ily vi&s;it A&s;ia and Africa for trade or conque&s;t, cannot the A&s;iaticks and Africans in|vade their coa&s;ts, plant colonies in their ports, and give laws to their natural princes? The &s;ame wind that carries them back would bring us thither."</P>
<P>"They are more powerful, Sir, than we, an&s;wered Imlac, becau&s;e they are wi&s;er; knowledge will always predominate over ig|norance, as man governs the other animals. But why their knowledge is more than ours, I know not what rea&s;on can be given, but the un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">chable will of the Supreme Being."</P>
<P>"When, &s;aid the prince with a &s;igh, &s;hall
<PB N="48" REF="010939_0049_0F852AA1592AC3A8">
I be able to vi&s;it Pale&s;tine, and mingle with this mighty confluence of nations? Till that happy moment &s;hall arrive, let me fill up the time with &s;uch repre&s;entations as thou can&s;t give me. I am not ignorant of the motive that a&s;&s;embles &s;uch numbers in that place, and cannot but con&s;ider it as the center of wi&s;dom and piety, to which the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men of every land mu&s;t be continually re&s;orting."</P>
<P>"There are &s;ome nations, &s;aid Imlac, that &s;end few vi&s;itants to Pale&s;tine; for many numerous and learned &s;ects in Europe, concur to cen&s;ure pilgrimage as &s;uper&s;titious, or deride it as ridiculous."</P>
<P>"You know, &s;aid the prince, how little my life has made me acquainted with diver&s;ity of opinions: it will be too long to hear the arguments on both &s;ides; you, that have con|&s;idered them, tell me the re&s;ult."</P>
<P>Pilgrimage, &s;aid Imlac, like many other acts of piety, may be rea&s;onable or &s;uper&s;titious, according to the principles upon which it is performed. Long journeys in &s;earch of truth are not commanded. Truth, &s;uch as is nece&s;|&s;ary to the regulation of life, is always found where it is hone&s;tly &s;ought. Change of place is no natural cau&s;e of the increa&s;e of piety, for
<PB N="49" REF="010939_0050_0F852AA21AF79850">
it inevitably produces di&s;&s;ipation of mind. Yet, &s;ince men go every day to view the places where great actions have been performed, and return with &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ions of the event, curio&s;ity of the &s;ame kind may naturally di&s;po&s;e us to view that country whence our religion had its beginning; and I believe no man &s;urveys tho&s;e awful &s;cenes without &s;ome confirmation of holy re&s;olutions. That the Supreme Being may be more ea&s;ily propitiated in one place than in another, is the dream of idle &s;uper&s;titi|on; but that &s;ome places may operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner, is an opinion which hourly experience will ju&s;tify. He who &s;uppo&s;es that his vices may be more &s;ucce&s;sfully combated in Pale&s;tine, will, per|haps, find him&s;elf mi&s;taken, yet he may go thither without folly: he who thinks they will be more freely pardoned, di&s;honours at once his rea&s;on and religion."</P>
<P>"The&s;e, &s;aid the prince, are European di&s;|tinctions. I will con&s;ider them another time. What have you found to be the effect of know|ledge? are tho&s;e nations happier than we?"</P>
<P>"There is &s;o much infelicity, &s;aid the poet, in the world, that &s;carce any man has lei&s;ure from his own di&s;tre&s;&s;es to e&s;timate the compar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> happine&s;s of others.

by the natural de&s;ire which every mind feels of increa&s;ing its ideas. Ignorance is meer privation, by which nothing can be produced: it is a vacuity in which the &s;oul &s;its motionle&s;s and torpid for want of attraction; and, with|out knowing why, we always rejoice when we learn, and grieve when we forget. I am there|fore inclined to conclude, that, if nothing counteracts the natural con&s;equence of learning, we grow more happy as our minds take a wider range.</P>
<P>"In enumerating the particular comforts of life we will find many advantages on the &s;ide of the Europeans. They cure wounds and di&s;ea&s;es with which we langui&s;h and peri&s;h. We &s;uffer inclemencies of weather which they can obviate. They have engines for the di&s;patch of many laborious works, which we mu&s;t perform by manual indu&s;try. There is &s;uch communica|tion between di&s;tant places that one friend can hardly be &s;aid to be ab&s;ent from another.

of protection and reverence? All this may be done without the help of European refinements, which appear by their effects to be rather &s;pecious than u&s;eful. Let us leave them and pur&s;ue our journey."</P>
<P>"From Pale&s;tine, &s;aid Imlac, I pa&s;&s;ed through many regions of A&s;ia; in the more civilized kingdoms as a trader, and among the Barbarians of the mountains as a pilgrim. At la&s;t I began to long for my native country, that I might repo&s;e after my travels, and fa|tigues, in the places where I had &s;pent my earlie&s;t years, and gladden my old companions with the recital of my adventures. Often did I figure to my&s;elf tho&s;e, with whom I had &s;ported away the gay hours of dawning life, &s;itting round me in its evening, wondering at my tales, and li&s;tening to my coun&s;els.</P>
<P>"When this thought had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind, I con&s;idered every moment as wa&s;ted which did not bring me nearer to Abi&s;&s;inia. I ha&s;tened into Egypt, and, not|with&s;tanding my impatience, was detained ten months in the contemplation of its ancient mag|nificence, and in enquiries after the remains of its ancient learning. I found in Cairo a mixture of all nations; &s;ome brought thither by the love of knowledge, &s;ome by the hope of gain, and many by the de&s;ire of living
<PB N="53" REF="010939_0054_0F852AA7F631EE90">
after their own manner without ob&s;ervation, and of lying hid in the ob&s;curity of multitudes: for, in a city, populous as Cairo, it is po&s;&s;ible to obtain at the &s;ame time the gratifications of &s;ociety, and the &s;ecrecy of &s;olitude.</P>
<P>"From Cairo I travelled to Suez and embarked on the red &s;ea pa&s;&s;ing along the coa&s;t till I arrived at the port from which I had departed twenty years before. Here I joined my&s;elf to a caravan and re-entered my native country.</P>
<P>"I now expected the care&s;&s;es of my kin&s;|men, and the congratulations of my friends, and was not without hope that my father, whatever value he had &s;et upon riches, would own with gladne&s;s and pride, a &s;on who was able to add to the felicity and honour of the nation. But I was &s;oon convinced that my thoughts were vain. My father had been dead fourteen years, having divided his wealth among my brothers, who were removed to &s;ome other provinces. Of my companions the greater part was in the grave, of the re&s;t &s;ome could with difficulty remember me, and &s;ome con&s;idered me as one corrupted by foreign manners.</P>
<P>"A man u&s;ed to vici&s;&s;itudes is not ea&s;ily de|jected. I forgot, after a time, my di&s;appoint|ment,
<PB N="54" REF="010939_0055_0F852AA8AF132D90">
and endeavoured to recommend my&s;elf to the nobles of the kingdom: they admitted me to their tables, heard my &s;tory, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me. I opened a &s;chool, and was prohibited to teach. I then re&s;olved to &s;it down in the quiet of dome&s;tick life and addre&s;&s;ed a lady that was fond of my conver&s;ation, but rejected my &s;uit, becau&s;e my father was a merchant.</P>
<P>"Wearied at la&s;t with &s;olicitation and re|pul&s;es, I re&s;olved to hide my &s;elf for ever from the world, and depend no longer on the opinion or caprice of others. I waited for the time when the gate of the <HI>happy valley</HI> &s;hould open, that I might bid farewell to hope and fear: the day came; my performance was di&s;tingui&s;hed with favour, and I re&s;igned my&s;elf with joy to perpetual confinement."</P>
<P>"Ha&s;t thou here found happine&s;s at la&s;t? &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas. Tell me without re&s;erve; art thou content with thy condition? or, do&s;t thou wi&s;h to be again wandering and enquiring? All the Inhabitants of this valley celebrate their lot, and, at the annual vi&s;it of the emperor, invite others to partake of their felicity."</P>
<P>"Great prince, &s;aid Imlac, I &s;hall &s;peak the truth: I know not one of all your attendants who does not lament the hour when he entered this retreat. I am le&s;s unhappy than the re&s;t, becau&s;e I have a mind replete with Images,
<PB N="55" REF="010939_0056_0F852AA9AF176F68">
which I can vary and combine at plea&s;ure. I can amu&s;e my &s;olitude by the renovation of the knowledge which begins to fade from my memory, and with the recollection of ac|cidents of my pa&s;t life. Yet all this ends in the &s;orrowful con&s;ideration, that my accquir|ments are now u&s;ele&s;s, and that none of my plea&s;ures can be again enjoyed. The re&s;t, who&s;e minds have no impre&s;&s;ion but of the pre|&s;ent moment, are either corroded by malignant pa&s;&s;ions, or &s;it &s;tupid in the gloom of perpetual vacancy."</P>
<P>"What pa&s;&s;ions can infe&s;t tho&s;e, &s;aid the prince, who have no rivals? We are in a place where impotence precludes malice, and where all envy is repre&s;&s;ed by community of enjoy|ments."</P>
<P>"There may be community, &s;aid Imlac, of material po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but there can never be community of love or of e&s;teem. It mu&s;t hap|pen that one will plea&s;e more than another; he that knows him&s;elf de&s;pi&s;ed will always be envious; and &s;till more envious and ma|levolent, if he is condemned to live in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e him. The invitations, by which they allure others to a &s;tate which they feel to be wretched, pro|ceed from the natural malignity of hopele&s;s mi&s;ery&punc; They are weary of them&s;elves, and of each other, and expect to find relief in

new companions. They envy the liberty which their folly has forfeited, and would gladly &s;ee all mankind impri&s;oned like them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"From this crime, however, I am wholly free. No man can &s;ay that he is wretched by my per&s;ua&s;ion. I look with pity on the crowds who are annually &s;oliciting admi&s;&s;ion to capti|vity, and wi&s;h that it were lawful for me to warn them of their danger."</P>
<P>"My dear Imlac, &s;aid the prince, I will open to thee my whole heart, that I have long meditated an e&s;cape from the happy valley. I have examined the mountains on every &s;ide, but find my&s;elf in&s;uperably barred: teach me the way to break my pri&s;on; thou &s;halt be the companion of my flight, the guide of my ram|bles, the partner of my fortune, and my &s;ole director in the <HI>choice of life.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Sir, an&s;wered the poet, your e&s;cape will be difficult, and perhaps, you may &s;oon repent your curio&s;ity. The world, which you figure to your&s;elf &s;mooth and quiet as the lake in the valley, you will find a &s;ea foaming with tem|pe&s;ts, and boiling with whirlpools: you will be &s;ometimes overwhelmed by the waves of vio|lence, and &s;ometimes da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks of treachery. Amid&s;t wrongs and frauds, com|petitions and anxieties, you will wi&s;h a thou|&s;and

times for the&s;e &s;eats of quiet, and willingly quit hope to be free from fear."</P>
<P>"Do not &s;eek to deter me from my pur|po&s;e, &s;aid the prince. I am impatient to &s;ee what thou ha&s;t &s;een; and, &s;ince thou art thy|&s;elf weary of the valley, it is evident, that thy former &s;tate was better than this. Whatever be the con&s;equence of my experiment, I am re&s;olved to judge with my own eyes of the various conditions of men, and then to make deliberately my <HI>choice of life.</HI></P>
<P>"I am afraid &s;aid Imlac, you are hindered by &s;tronger re&s;traints than by per&s;ua&s;ions; yet, if your determination is fixed, I do not coun&s;el you to de&s;pair. Few things are impo&s;&s;ible to diligence and &s;kill."</P>

<P>THE prince now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his favourite to re&s;t, but the narrative of wonders and novelties filled his mind with perturbation. He revolved all that he had heard, and pre|pared innumerable que&s;tions for the morning.</P>
<P>Much of his unea&s;ine&s;s was now removed. He had a friend to whom he could impart his
<PB N="58" REF="010939_0059_0F852AB17A988CA0">
thoughts, and who&s;e experience could a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his de&s;igns. His heart was no longer con|demned to &s;well with &s;ilent vexation. He thought that even the <HI>happy valley</HI> might be endured with &s;uch a companion, and that, if they could range the world together, he &s;hould have nothing further to de&s;ire.</P>
<P>In a few days the water was di&s;charged, and the ground dried. The prince and Imlac then walked out together to conver&s;e without the notice of the re&s;t. The prince, who&s;e thoughts were always on the wing, as he pa&s;&s;ed by the gate, &s;aid, with a countenance of &s;orrow, "Why art thou &s;o &s;trong, and why is man &s;o weak;"</P>
<P>"Man is not weak, an&s;wered his com|panion; knowledge is more than equivalent to force. The ma&s;ter of mechanicks laughs at &s;trength. I can bur&s;t the gate, but cannot do it &s;ecretly. &s;ome other expedient mu&s;t be tried."</P>
<P>As they were walking on the &s;ide of the mountain, they ob&s;erved that the conies, which the rain had driven from their burrows, had taken &s;helter among the bu&s;hes, and formed holes behind them, tending upwards in an oblique line. "It has been the opinion of antiquity, &s;aid Imlac, that human rea&s;on bor|rowed

many arts from the in&s;tinct of animals; let us, therefore, not think our&s;elves degraded by learning from the coney. We may e&s;cape by piercing the mountain in the &s;ame direction. We will begin where the &s;ummit hangs over the middle part, and labour upward till we &s;hall i&s;&s;ue out beyond the prominence."</P>
<P>The eyes of the prince, when he heard this propo&s;al, &s;parkled with joy. The execution was ea&s;y, and the &s;ucce&s;s certain.</P>
<P>No time was now lo&s;t. They ha&s;tened early in the morning to chu&s;e a place proper for their mine. They clambered with great fatigue among crags and brambles, and return|ed without having di&s;covered any part that favoured their de&s;ign. The &s;econd and the third day were &s;pent in the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame fru&s;tration. But, on the fourth, they found a &s;mall cavern, concealed by a thicket, where they re&s;olved to make their experiment.</P>
<P>Imlac, procured in&s;truments proper to hew &s;tone and remove earth, and they fell to their work on the next day with more eagerne&s;s than vigour. They were pre&s;ently exhau&s;ted by their efforts, and &s;at down to pant upon the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s. The prince for a moment, appear&punc; to be di&s;couraged. "Sir, &s;aid his companion

practice will enable us to continue our labour for a longer time; and mark, however, how far we have advanced, and you will find that our toil will &s;ome time have an end.

<P>They returned to their labour day after day, and, in a &s;hort time found a fi&s;&s;ure in the rock, which enabled them to pa&s;s far with very little ob&s;truction. This Ra&s;&s;elas con&s;idered as a good omen. "Do not di&s;turb your mind, &s;aid Imlac, with other hopes or fears than rea&s;on may &s;ugge&s;t; if you are plea&s;ed with progno&s;ticks of good, you will be terrified likewi&s;e with tokens of evil, and your whole life will be a prey to &s;uper&s;tition.

<P>THEY had now wrought their way to the middle, and &s;olaced their labour with the approach of liberty, when the prince coming down to refre&s;h him&s;elf with air, found his &s;i&s;ter Nekayah &s;tanding before the mouth of the cavity. He &s;tarted and &s;tood confu&s;ed, afraid to tell his de&s;ign, and yet hopele&s;s to conceal it. A few moments determined him to repo&s;e on her fidelity, and &s;ecure her &s;ecrecy by a declaration without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>"Do not imagine, &s;aid the prince&s;s, that I came hither as a &s;py: I had often ob&s;erved from my window that you and Imlac directed your walk every day towards the &s;ame point, but I did not &s;uppo&s;e that you had any better rea&s;on for the preference than a cooler &s;hade, or more fragrant bank; nor followed you with any other de&s;ign than to partake of your con|ver&s;ation. Since then not &s;u&s;picion but fond|ne&s;s has detected you, let me not lo&s;e the advantage of my di&s;covery. I am equally weary of confinement with your&s;elf, and not le&s;s de&s;irous of knowing what is done or &s;uf|fered in the world. Permit me to fly with you from this ta&s;tele&s;s tranquillity, which will yet grow more loath&s;ome when you have left me.
<PB N="62" REF="010939_0063_0F852AB4F373F388">
You may deny me to accompany you, but cannot hinder me from following."</P>
<P>The prince, who loved Nekayah above his other &s;i&s;ters, had no inclination to refu&s;e her reque&s;t, and grieved that he had lo&s;t an oppor|tunity of &s;hewing his confidence by a volun|tary communication. It was therefore agreed that &s;he &s;hould leave the valley with them; and that, in the mean time, &s;he &s;hould watch, lea&s;t any other &s;traggler &s;hould, by chance or curio&s;ity, follow them to the mountain.</P>
<P>At length their labour was at an end; they &s;aw light beyond the prominence, and, i&s;&s;uing to the top of the mountain, beheld the Nile, yet a narrow current, wandering beneath them.</P>
<P>The prince looked round with rapture, an|ticipated all the plea&s;ures of travel, and in thought was already tran&s;ported beyond his fathers dominions. Imlac, though very joyful at his e&s;cape, had le&s;s expectation of plea&s;ure in the world, which he had before tried, and of which he had been weary.</P>
<P>Ra&s;&s;elas was &s;o much delighted with a wider horizon, that he could not &s;oon be per&s;uaded to return into the valley. He informed his &s;i&s;ter that the way was open, and that nothing now remained but to prepare for their departure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV The prince and prince&s;s leave the valley, and &s;ee many wonders.</HEAD>
<P>THE prince and prince&s;s had jewels &s;uf|ficient to make them rich whenever they came into a place of commerce, which, by Im|lac's direction, they hid in their cloaths, and, on the night of the next full moon, all left the valley. The prince&s;s was followed only by a &s;ingle favourite, who did not know whither &s;he was going.</P>
<P>They clambered through the cavity, and began to go down on the other &s;ide. The prince&s;s and her maid turned their eyes towards every part, and, &s;eeing nothing to bound their pro&s;pect, con&s;idered them&s;elves as in danger of being lo&s;t in a dreary vacuity. They &s;topped and trembled. "I am almo&s;t afraid, &s;aid the prince&s;s, to begin a journey of which I cannot perceive an end, and to venture into this im|men&s;e plain where I may be approached on every &s;ide by men whom I never &s;aw." The prince felt nearly the &s;ame motions, though he thought it more manly to conceal them.</P>
<P>Imlac &s;miled at their terrors, and encouraged them to proceed; but the prince&s;s continued
<PB N="64" REF="010939_0065_0F852AB658D08618">
irre&s;olute, till &s;he had been imperceptibly drawn forward too far to return.</P>
<P>In the morning they found &s;ome &s;hepherds in the field, who &s;et milk and fruits before them. The prince&s;s wondered that &s;he did not &s;ee a palace ready for her reception, and a table &s;pread with delicacies; but, being faint and hungry, &s;he drank the milk and eat the fruits, and thought them of a higher flavour than the products of the valley.</P>
<P>They travelled forward by ea&s;y journeys, be|ing all unaccu&s;tomed to toil or difficulty, and knowing, that though they might be mi&s;&s;ed, they could not be pur&s;ued. In a few days they came into a more populous region, where Imlac was diverted with the admiration which his companions expre&s;&s;ed at the diver&s;ity of manners, &s;tations; and employments.</P>
<P>Their dre&s;s was &s;uch as might not bring up|on them the &s;u&s;picion of having any thing to conceal, yet the prince, wherever he came, ex|pected to be obeyed, and the prince&s;s was fright|ed, becau&s;e tho&s;e that came into her pre&s;ence did not pro&s;trate them&s;elves before her. Imlac was forced to ob&s;erve them with great vigi|lance, le&s;t they &s;hould betray their rank by their unu&s;ual behaviour, and detained them &s;everal weeks in the fir&s;t village to accu&s;tom them to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ght of common mortals<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">punc;</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="010939_0066_0F852AB731447CE0">
By degrees the royal wanderers were taught to under&s;tand that they had for a time laid a&s;ide their dignity, and were to expect only &s;uch regard as liberality and courte&s;y could procure. And Imlac, having, by many admonitions, prepared them to endure the tumults of a port, and the ruggedne&s;s of the commercial race, brought them down to the &s;ea-coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The prince and his &s;i&s;ter, to whom every thing was new, were gratified equally at all places, and therefore remained for &s;ome months at the port without any inclination to pa&s;s fur|ther. Imlac was content with their &s;tay, be|cau&s;e he did not think it &s;afe to expo&s;e them, unpracti&s;ed in the world, to the hazards of a foreign country.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he began to fear le&s;t they &s;hould be di&s;covered, and propo&s;ed to fix a day of their departure. They had no preten&s;ions to judge for them&s;elves, and referred the whole &s;cheme to his direction. He therefore took pa&s;&s;age in a &s;hip to Suez; and, when the time came, with great difficulty prevailed on the prince&s;s to en|ter the ve&s;&s;el. They had a quick and pro&s;per|ous voyage, and from Suez travelled by land to Cairo.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. They enter Cairo, and find every man happy.</HEAD>
<P>AS they approached the city, which filled the &s;trangers with a&s;toni&s;hment, "This, &s;aid Imlac to the prince, is the place where travellers and merchants a&s;&s;emble from all the corners of the earth. You will here find men of every character, and every occupation.

<P>They now entered the town, &s;tunned by the noi&s;e, and offended by the crowds. In&s;truction had not yet &s;o prevailed over habit, but that they wondered to &s;ee them&s;elves pa&s;s undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed along the &s;treet, and met by the lowe&s;t of the people without reverence or notice. The prince&s;s could not at fir&s;t bear the thought of being levelled with the vulgar, and, for &s;ome days, continued in her chamber, where &s;he was &s;erved by her favourite as in the palace of the valley.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="010939_0068_0F852AB8A4C59AD0">
Imlac, who under&s;tood traffick, &s;old part of the jewels the next day, and hire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a hou&s;e, which he adorned with &s;uch magnificence, that he was immediately con&s;ider'd as a merchant of great wealth. His politene&s;s attracted many acquaintance, and his genero&s;ity made him courted by many dependants. His table was crowded by men of every nation, who all admired his knowledge and &s;olicited his favour. His companions, not being able to mix in the conver&s;ation, could make no di&s;covery of their ignorance or &s;urpri&s;e, and were gradually initi|ated in the world, as they gained knowledge of the language.</P>
<P>The prince had, by frequent lectures, been taught the u&s;e and nature of money; but the ladies could not, for a long time comprehend what the merchants did with &s;mall pieces of gold and &s;ilver, or why things of &s;o little u&s;e &s;hould be received as equivalent to the nece&s;|&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>They &s;tudied the language two years, while Imlac was preparing to &s;et before them the various ranks and conditions of mankind. He grew acquainted with all who had any thing uncommon in their fortune or conduct. He frequented the voluptuous and the frugal, the idle and the bu&s;y, the merchants and the men of learning.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="010939_0069_0F852AB976C40500">
The prince, being now able to conver&s;e with fluency, and having learned the caution nece&s;|&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in his intercour&s;e with &s;trangers, began to accompany Imlac to places of re&s;ort, and to enter into all a&s;&s;emblies, that he might make his <HI>choice of life.</HI></P>
<P>For &s;ome time he thought choice needle&s;s, becau&s;e all appeared to him equally happy. Wherever he went he met gaiety and kindne&s;s, and heard the &s;ong of joy, or the laugh of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. He began to believe that the world overflowed with univer&s;al plenty, and that nothing was with-held either from want or merit; that every hand &s;howered liberality, and every heart melted with benevolence: "And who then, &s;ays he, will be &s;uffered to be wretched?"</P>
<P>Imlac permitted the plea&s;ing delu&s;ion, and was unwilling to cru&s;h the hope of inexperience, till one day, having &s;at a while &s;ilent, "I know not, &s;aid the prince, what can be the rea&s;on that I am more unhappy than any of our friends. I &s;ee them perpetually and unaltera|bly chearful, but feel my own mind re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y. I am un&s;atisfied with tho&s;e plea|&s;ures which I &s;eem mo&s;t to court; I live in the crowds of jollity, not &s;o much to enjoy company as to &s;hun my&s;elf; and am only loud and merry to conceal my &s;adne&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="010939_0070_0F852ABA155F5428">
"Every man, &s;aid Imlac, may, by ex|amining his own mind, gue&s;s what pa&s;&s;es in the minds of others: when you feel that your own gaiety is counterfeit, it may ju&s;tly lead you to &s;u&s;pect that of your companions not to be &s;incere. Envy is commonly reciprocal. We are long before we are convinced that happine&s;s is never to be found, and each be|lieves it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by others, to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for him&s;elf. In the a&s;&s;embly, where you pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t night, there appeared &s;uch &s;prightline&s;s of air, and volatility of fancy, as might have &s;uited beings of an higher order, formed to inhabit &s;erener regions inacce&s;&s;ible to care or &s;orrow: yet, believe me, prince, there was not one who did not dread the moment when &s;olitude &s;hould deliver him to the tyranny of reflection."</P>
<P>"This &s;aid the prince, may be true of others &s;ince it is true of me; yet, whatever be the general infelicity of man, one condition is more happy than another, and wi&s;dom &s;urely directs us to take the lea&s;t evil in the <HI>choice of life.</HI>"</P>
<P>"The cau&s;es of good and evil, an&s;wered Imlac, are &s;o various and uncertain, &s;o often entangled with each other, &s;o diver&s;ified by various relations, and &s;o much &s;ubject to ac|cidents which cannot be fore&s;een, that he who
<PB N="70" REF="010939_0071_0F852ABADFB96238">
would &s;ix his condition upon inconte&s;table rea|&s;ons of preference, mu&s;t live and die enquiring and deliberating."</P>
<P>"But &s;urely, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, the wi&s;e men, to whom we li&s;ten with reverence and wonder, cho&s;e that mode of life for them&s;elves which they thought mo&s;t likely to make them happy."</P>
<P>"Very few, &s;aid the poet, live by choice. Every man is placed in his pre&s;ent condition by cau&s;es which acted without his fore&s;ight, and with which he did not always willingly co-operate; and therefore you will rarely meet one who does not think the lot of his neighbour better than his own."</P>
<P>"I am plea&s;ed to think, &s;aid the prince, that my birth has given me at lea&s;t one advantage over others, by enabling me to determine for my &s;elf. I have here the world before me; I will review it at lea&s;ure: &s;urely happine&s;s is &s;omewhere to be found."</P>

<P>RASSELAS ro&s;e next day, and re&s;olv|ed to begin his experiments upon life. "Youth, cried he, is the time of gladne&s;s: I will join my&s;elf to the young men, who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s is to gratify their de&s;ires, and who&s;e time is all &s;pent in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of enjoyments."</P>
<P>To &s;uch &s;ocieties he was readily admitted, but a few days brought him back weary and di&s;gu&s;ted. Their mirth was without images, their laughter without motive; their plea&s;ures were gro&s;s and &s;en&s;ual, in which the mind had no part; their conduct was at once wild and mean; they laughed at order and at law, but the frown of power dejected, and the eye of wi&s;dom aba&s;hed them.</P>
<P>The prince &s;oon concluded, that he &s;hould never be happy in a cour&s;e of life of which he was a&s;hamed. He thought it un&s;uitable to a rea&s;onable being to act without a plan, and to be &s;ad or chearful only by chance. "Happi|ne&s;s, &s;aid he, mu&s;t be &s;omething &s;olid and per|manent, without fear and without uncertainty."</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="010939_0073_0F852ABC988CD210">
But his young companions had gained &s;o much of his regard by their frankne&s;s and courte&s;y, that he could not leave them with|out warning and remon&s;trance. "My friends, &s;aid he, I have &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered our man|ners and our pro&s;pects, and find that we have mi&s;taken our own intere&s;t. The fir&s;t years of man mu&s;t make provi&s;ion for the la&s;t. He that never thinks never can be wi&s;e. Perpe|tual levity mu&s;t end in ignorance; and intem|perance, though it may fire the &s;pirits for an hour, will make life &s;hort or mi&s;erable. Let us con&s;ider that youth is of no long duration, and that in maturer age, when the enchant|ments of fancy &s;hall cea&s;e, and phantoms of delight dance no more about us, we &s;hall have no comforts but the e&s;teem of wi&s;e men, and the means of doing good. Let us, therefore, &s;top, while to &s;top is in our power: let us live as men who are &s;ome time to grow old, and to whom it will be the mo&s;t dreadful of all evils not to count their pa&s;t years but by their follies, and to be reminded of their former luxuriance of health only by the maladies which riot has produced."</P>
<P>They &s;tared awhile in &s;ilence one upon ano|ther, and, at la&s;t, drove him away by a gene|ral chorus of continued laughter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. The prince finds a wi&s;e and happy man.</HEAD>
<P>AS he was one day walking in the &s;treet, he &s;aw a &s;pacious building, which all were, by the open doors, invited to enter: he followed the &s;tream of people, and found it a hall or &s;chool of declamation; in which profe&s;|&s;ors read lectures to their auditory. He fixed his eye upon a &s;age rai&s;ed above the re&s;t, who di&s;cour&s;ed with great energy on the govern|ment of the pa&s;&s;ions. His look was venera|ble, his action graceful, his pronunciation clear, and his diction elegant. He &s;hewed, with great &s;trength of &s;entiment, and variety of il|lu&s;tration, that human nature is degraded and deba&s;ed, when the lower faculties predominate over the higher; that when fancy, the parent of pa&s;&s;ion, u&s;urps the dominion of the mind, nothing en&s;ues but the natural effect of unlaw|ful government, perturbation and confu&s;ion; that &s;he betrays the fortre&s;&s;es of the intellect to rebels, and excites her children to &s;edition again&s;t rea&s;on, their lawful &s;overeign. He compared rea&s;on to the &s;un, of which the light
<PB N="74" REF="010939_0075_0F852ABDEC406650">
is con&s;tant, uniform and la&s;ting; and fancy to a meteor, of bright but tran&s;itory lu&s;tre, irregular in its motion, and delu&s;ive in its direction.</P>
<P>He then communicated the various pre|cepts given from time to time for the conque&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, and di&s;played the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who had obtained the important victory, after which man is no longer the &s;lave of fear, nor fool of hope; is no more emaciated by envy, inflamed by anger, ema&s;culated by tenderne&s;s, or depre&s;&s;ed by grief; but walks on calmly through the tumults or the privacies of life, as the &s;un pur&s;ues alike his cour&s;e through the calm or the &s;tormy &s;ky.</P>
<P>He enumerated many examples of heroes in moveable by pain or plea&s;ure, who looked with indifference on tho&s;e modes or acci|dents to which the vulgar give the names of good and evil. He exhorted his hearers to lay a&s;ide their prejudices, and arm them&s;elves again&s;t the &s;hafts of malice or misfortune, by invulnerable patience; concluding, that this &s;tate only was happine&s;s, and that this happi|ne&s;s was in every one's power.</P>
<P>Ra&s;&s;elas li&s;tened to him with the veneration due to the in&s;tructions of a &s;uperior being, and waiting for him at the door, humbly im|plored
<PB N="75" REF="010939_0076_0F852ABEAF4286A8">
the liberty of vi&s;iting &s;o great a ma&s;ter of true wi&s;dom. The lecturer he&s;itated a mo|ment, when Ra&s;&s;elas put a pur&s;e of gold into his hand, which he received with a mixture of joy and wonder.</P>
<P>"I have found, &s;aid the prince, at his re|turn to Imlac, a man who can teach all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be known, who, from the un|&s;haken throne of rational fortitude, looks down on the &s;cenes of life changing beneath him. He &s;peaks, and attention watches his lips. He rea&s;ons, and conviction clo&s;es his periods. This man &s;hall be my future guide: I will learn his doctrines, and imitate his life."</P>
<P>"Be not too ha&s;ty, &s;aid Imlac, to tru&s;t, or to admire, the teachers of morality: they di&s;|cour&s;e like angels, but they live like men."</P>
<P>Ra&s;&s;elas, who could not conceive how any man could rea&s;on &s;o forcibly without feeling the cogency of his own arguments, paid his vi&s;it in a few days, and was denied admi&s;&s;ion. He had now learned the power of money, and made his way by a piece of gold to the inner apartment, where he found the philo&s;opher in a room half darkned, with his eyes mi&s;ty, and his face pale. "Sir, &s;aid he, you are come at a time when all human friend&s;hip is u&s;ele&s;s; what I &s;uffer cannot be remedied, what I have
<PB N="76" REF="010939_0077_0F852ABF55EFB130">
lo&s;t cannot be &s;upplied. My daughter, my only daughter, from who&s;e tenderne&s;s I ex|pected all the comforts of my age, died la&s;t night of a fever. My views, my purpo&s;es, my hopes are at an end: I am now a lonely being di&s;united from &s;ociety."</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the prince, mortality is an event by which a wi&s;e man can never be &s;urpri&s;ed: we know that death is always near, and it &s;hould therefore always be expected. "Young man, an&s;wered the philo&s;opher, you &s;peak like one that has never felt the pangs of &s;eparati|on." "Have you then forgot the pre|cepts, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, which you &s;o powerfully enforced? Has wi&s;dom no &s;trength to arm the heart again&s;t calamity? Con&s;ider, that ex|ternal things are naturally variable, but truth and rea&s;on are always the &s;ame." "What comfort &s;aid the mourner, can truth and rea|&s;on afford me? of what effect are they now, but to tell me, that my daughter will not be re&s;tored?"</P>
<P>The prince, who&s;e humanity would not &s;uf|fer him to in&s;ult mi&s;ery with reproof, went away convinced of the emptine&s;s of rhetorical &s;ound, and the inefficacy of poli&s;hed periods and &s;tudied &s;entences.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. A glimp&s;e of pa&s;toral life.</HEAD>
<P>HE was &s;till eager upon the &s;ame enquiry; and, having heard of a hermit, that lived near the lowe&s;t cataract of the Nile, and filled the whole country with the fame of his &s;anctity, re&s;olved to vi&s;it his retreat, and en|quire whether that felicity, which publick life could not afford, was to be found in &s;olitude; and whether a man, who&s;e age and virtue made him venerable, could teach any peculiar art of &s;hunning evils, or enduring them.</P>
<P>Imlac and the prince&s;s agreed to accompany him, and, after the nece&s;&s;ary preparations, they began their journey. Their way lay through fields where &s;hepherds tended their flocks, and the lambs were playing upon the pa&s;ture." "This &s;aid the poet, is the life which has been often celebrated for its innocence and quiet: let us pa&s;s the heat of the day among the &s;hepherds tents, and know whether all our &s;earches are not to terminate in pa&s;toral &s;implicity."</P>
<P>The propo&s;al plea&s;ed them, and they in|duced the &s;hepherds, by &s;mall pre&s;ents and familiar que&s;tions, to tell their opinion of their
<PB N="78" REF="010939_0079_0F852AC11C7D22F8">
own &s;tate: they were &s;o rude and ignorant, &s;o little able to compare the good with the evil of the occupation, and &s;o indi&s;tinct in their narratives and de&s;criptions, that very lit|tle could be learned from them. But it was evident that their hearts were cankered with di&s;content; that they con&s;idered them&s;elves as condemned to labour for the luxury of the rich, and looked up with &s;tupid malevolence toward tho&s;e that were placed above them.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s pronounced with vehemence, that &s;he would never &s;uffer the&s;e envious &s;a|vages to be her companions, and that &s;he &s;hould not &s;oon be de&s;irous of &s;eeing any more &s;pecimens of ru&s;tick happine&s;s; but could not believe that all the accounts of primeval plea|&s;ures were fabulous, and was yet in doubt whether life had any thing in it that could be ju&s;tly preferred to the placid gratifications of fields and woods. She hoped that the time would come, when, with a few virtuous and elegant companions, &s;he &s;hould gather flowers planted by her own hand, fondle the lambs of her own ewes, and li&s;ten, without care, among brooks and breezes, to one of her maidens reading in the &s;hade.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. The danger of pro&s;perity.</HEAD>
<P>ON the next day they continued their journey, till the heat compelled them to look round for &s;helter. At a &s;mall di&s;tance they &s;aw a thick wood, which they no &s;ooner entered than they perceived that they were approaching the habitations of men. The &s;hrubs were diligently cut away to open walks where the &s;hades were darke&s;t; the boughs of oppo&s;ite trees were artificially interwoven; &s;eats of flowery turf were rai&s;ed in vacant &s;paces, and a rivulet, that wantoned along the &s;ide of a winding path, had its banks &s;ometimes opened into &s;mall ba&s;ons, and its &s;tream &s;ome|times ob&s;tructed by little mounds of &s;tone heaped together to increa&s;e its murmurs.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly through the wood, de|lighted with &s;uch unexpected accommodations, and entertained each other with conjecturing what, or who, he could be, that, in tho&s;e rude and unfrequented regions, had lei&s;ure and art for &s;uch harmle&s;s luxury.</P>
<P>As they advanced, they heard the &s;ound of mu&s;ick, and &s;aw youths and virgins dancing in the grove; and, going &s;till further, beheld
<PB N="80" REF="010939_0081_0F852AC25C3AC2C8">
a &s;tately palace built upon a hill &s;urrounded with woods. The laws of ea&s;tern ho&s;pitality allowed them to enter, and the ma&s;ter wel|comed them like a man liberal and wealthy.</P>
<P>He was &s;kilful enough in appearances &s;oon to di&s;cern that they were no common gue&s;ts, and &s;pread his table with magnificence. The eloquence of Imlac caught his attention, and the lofty courte&s;y of the prince&s;s excited his re&s;pect. When they offered to depart, he en|treated their &s;tay, and was the next day &s;till more unwilling to di&s;mi&s;s them than before&punc; they were ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to &s;top, and civility grew up in time to freedom and confidence.</P>
<P>The prince now &s;aw all the dome&s;ticks chearful, and all the face of nature &s;miling round the place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could not forbear to hope that he &s;hould find here what he was &s;eeking; but when he was congratulating the ma&s;ter upon his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he an&s;wered with a &s;igh, "My condition has indeed the ap|pearance of happine&s;s, but appearances are delu&s;ive. My pro&s;perity puts my life in dan|ger; the Ba&s;&s;a of Egypt is my enemy, incen&s;ed only by my wealth and popularity.

<P>They all joined in lamenting his danger, and deprecating his exile; and the prince&s;s was &s;o much di&s;turbed with the tumult of grief and indignation, that &s;he retired to her apartment. They continued with their kind inviter a few days longer, and then went for|ward to find the hermit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. The happine&s;s of &s;olitude. The hermit's hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>THEY came on the third day, by the direction of the pea&s;ants, to the hermit's cell: it was a cavern in the &s;ide of a mountain, over-&s;hadow'd with palm-trees; at &s;uch a di&s;|tance from the cataract, that nothing more was heard than a gentle uniform murmur, &s;uch as compo&s;ed the mind to pen&s;ive meditation, e&s;pecially when it was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the wind whi&s;tling among the branches. The fir&s;t rude e&s;&s;ay of nature had been &s;o much improved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> human labour, that the cave contained &s;everal apartments, appropriated to different
<PB N="82" REF="010939_0083_0F852AC3D9768A18">
u&s;es, and often afforded lodging to travellers, whom darkne&s;s or tempe&s;ts happened to overtake.</P>
<P>The hermit &s;at on a bench at the door, to enjoy the coolne&s;s of the evening. On one &s;ide lay a book with pens and papers, on the other mechanical in&s;truments of various kinds. As they approached him unregarded, the prince&s;s ob&s;erved that he had not the countenance of a man that had found, or could teach, the way to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>They &s;aluted him with great re&s;pect, which he repaid like a man not unaccu&s;tomed to the forms of courts. "My children &s;aid he, if you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t your way, you &s;hall be willingly &s;upplied with &s;uch conveniencies for the night as this cavern will afford.

<P>They thanked him and entering, were plea&s;ed with the neatne&s;s and regularity of the place. The hermit &s;et fle&s;h and wine before them, though he fed only upon fruits and water. His di&s;cour&s;e was chearful without levity, and pious without enthu&s;ia&s;m. He &s;oon gained the e&s;teem of his gue&s;ts and the prince&s;s repented of her ha&s;ty cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="010939_0084_0F852AC4A3ADBA60">
At la&s;t Imlac began thus: "I do not now wonder that your reputation is &s;o far extended; we have heard at Cairo of your wi&s;dom, and came hither to implore your direction for this young man and maiden in the <HI>choice of life.</HI>"</P>
<P>"To him that lives well, an&s;wered the hermit, every form of life is good; nor can I give any other rule for choice, than to re|move from all apparent evil."</P>
<P>"He will remove mo&s;t certainly from evil, &s;aid the prince, who &s;hall devote him&s;elf to that &s;olitude which you have recommended by your example."</P>
<P>"I have indeed lived fifteen years in &s;oli|tude, &s;aid the hermit but have no de&s;ire that my example &s;hould gain any imitators. In my youth I profe&s;&s;ed arms, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ed by de|grees to the highe&s;t military rank. I have traver&s;ed wide countries at the head of my troops, and &s;een many battles and &s;ieges. At la&s;t, being di&s;gu&s;ted by the preferment of a younger officer, and finding my vigour be|ginning to decay, I re&s;olved to clo&s;e my life in peace, having found the world full of &s;nares, di&s;cord, and mi&s;ery. I had once e&s;caped from the pur&s;uit of the enemy by the &s;helter of this cavern, and therefore cho&s;e it for my final
<PB N="84" REF="010939_0085_0F852AC55A08D350">
re&s;idence. I employed artificers to form it into chambers, and &s;tored it with all that I was likely to want."</P>
<P>"For &s;ome time after my retreat, I rejoiced like a tempe&s;t-beaten &s;ailor at his entrance into the harbour, being delighted with the &s;ud|den change of the noi&s;e, and hurry of war, to &s;tillne&s;s and repo&s;e. When the plea&s;ure of novelty went away, I employed my hours in examining the plants which grow in the valley, and the minerals which I collected from the rocks. But that enquiry is now grown ta&s;tele&s;s and irk&s;ome. I have been for &s;ome time un|&s;ettled and di&s;tracted: my mind is di&s;turbed with a thou&s;and perplexities of doubt, and vanities of imagination, which hourly prevail upon me, becau&s;e I have no opportunities of relaxation or diver&s;ion. I am &s;ometimes a|&s;hamed to think that I could not &s;ecure my&s;elf from vice, but by retiring from the practice of virtue, and begin to &s;u&s;pect that I was ra|ther impelled by re&s;entment, than led by devo|tion, into &s;olitude. My fancy riots in &s;cenes of folly, and I lament that I have lo&s;t &s;o much, and have gained &s;o little. In &s;olitude, if I e&s;cape the example of bad men, I want like wi&s;e the coun&s;el and conver&s;ation of the good.

&s;o laudably followed. The &s;entiments of the hearers were various. Some were of opinion, that the folly of his choice had been ju&s;tly puni&s;hed by condemnation to perpetual per&s;e|verance. One of the younge&s;t among them, with great vehemence, pronounced him an hypocrite. Some talked of the right of &s;ociety to the labour of individuals, and con&s;idered retirement as a de&s;ertion of duty. Others readily allowed, that there was a time when the claims of the publick were &s;atisfied, and when a man might properly &s;eque&s;ter him&s;elf, to review his life, and purify his heart.</P>
<P>One, who appeared more affected with the narrative than the re&s;t, thought it likely, that the hermit would, in a few years, go back to his retreat, and, perhaps, if &s;hame did not re|&s;train, or death intercept him, return once more from his retreat into the world: "For the hope of happine&s;s, &s;ays he, is &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed, that the longe&s;t experience is not able to efface it.

Nothing is more idle, than to enquire after happine&s;s, which nature, has kindly placed within our reach. The way to be happy is to live according to na|ture, in obedience to that univer&s;al and un|alterable law with which every heart is ori|ginally impre&s;&s;ed; which is not written on it by precept, but engraven by de&s;tiny, not in|&s;tilled by education, but infu&s;ed at our nativity. He that lives according to nature, will &s;uffer nothing from the delu&s;ions of hope, or impor|tunities of de&s;ire: He will receive and reject with equability of temper; and act or &s;uffer as the rea&s;on of things &s;hall alternately pre|&s;cribe. Other men may amu&s;e them&s;elves with &s;ubtle definitions, or intricate ratiocina|tion. Let them learn to be wi&s;e by ea&s;ier means: let them ob&s;erve the hind of the fore&s;t, and the linnet of the grove: let them con&s;ider the life of animals, who&s;e motions are regulated by in&s;tinct; they obey their guide and are hap|py. Let us therefore at length, cea&s;e to di&s;|pute, and learn to live; throw away the in|cumbrance of precepts, which they who utter them with &s;o much pride and pomp do not under&s;tand, and carry with us this &s;imple and intelligible maxim, That deviation from nature is deviation from happine&s;s."</P>

When he had &s;poken, he looked round him with a placid air, and enjoyed the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own beneficence. "Sir, &s;aid the prince, with great mode&s;ty, as I, like all the re&s;t of mankind, am de&s;irous of felicity, my clo&s;e&s;t attention has been fixed upon your di&s;cour&s;e: I doubt not the truth of a po&s;ition which a man &s;o learned has &s;o confidently advanced. Let me only know what it is to live according to nature."</P>
<P>"When I find young men &s;o humble and &s;o docile, &s;aid the philo&s;opher, I can deny them no information which my &s;tudies have enabled me to afford. To live according to nature, is to act always with due regard to the fitne&s;s ari&s;ing from the relations and qualities of cau&s;es and effects; to concur with the great and un|changeable &s;cheme of univer&s;al felicity; to co-operate with the general di&s;po&s;ition and ten|dency of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. The prince and his &s;i&s;ter divide between them the work of ob&s;ervation.</HEAD>
<P>RASSELAS returned home full of re|flections, doubtful how to direct his fu|ture &s;teps. Of the way to happine&s;s he found the learned and &s;imple equally ignorant; but, as he was yet young, he flattered him|&s;elf that he had time remaining for more expe|riments, and further enquiries. He commu|nicated to Imlac his ob&s;ervations and his doubts, but was an&s;wered by him with new doubts, and remarks that gave him no com|fort. He therefore di&s;cour&s;ed more frequently and freely with his &s;i&s;ter, who had yet the &s;ame hope with him&s;elf, and always a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to give &s;ome rea&s;on why, though he had been hitherto fru&s;trated, he might &s;ucceed at la&s;t.</P>
<P>"We have hitherto, &s;aid &s;he, known but little of the world: we have never yet been either great or mean. In our own country, though we had royalty, we had no power, and in this we have not &s;een the private rece&s;|&s;es of dome&s;tick peace. Imlac favours not our &s;earch, le&s;t we &s;hould in time find him mi&s;taken. We will divide the ta&s;k between us: you &s;hall try what is to be found in the &s;plendor of courts, and I will range the &s;hades of humbler life. Perhaps command and au|thority may be the &s;upreme ble&s;&s;ings, as they

afford mo&s;t opportunities of doing good: or, perhaps, what this world can give may be found in the mode&s;t habitations of middle for|tune; too low for great de&s;igns, and too high for penury and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. The prince examines the happine&s;s of high &s;tations.</HEAD>
<P>RASSELAS applauded the de&s;ign, and appeared next day with a &s;plendid retinue at the court of the Ba&s;&s;a. He was &s;oon di&s;|tingui&s;hed for his magnificence, and admitted, as a prince who&s;e curio&s;ity had brought him from di&s;tant countries, to an intimacy with the great officers, and frequent conver&s;ation with the Ba&s;&s;a him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was fir&s;t inclined to believe, that the man mu&s;t be plea&s;ed with his own condition, whom all approached with reverence, and heard with obedience, and who had the power to extend his edicts to a whole kingdom. "There can be no plea&s;ure, &s;aid he, equal to that of feeling at once the joy of thou&s;ands all made happy by wi&s;e admini&s;tration, Yet, &s;ince, by the law of &s;ubordination, this &s;ublime delight can be in one nation but the lot of one, it is &s;urely rea|&s;onable to think there is &s;ome &s;atisfaction more popular and acce&s;&s;ible, and that millions can hardly be &s;ubjected to the will of a &s;ingle man,
<PB N="91" REF="010939_0092_0F852ACCF4CA6398">
only to fill his particular brea&s;t with incom|municable content."</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts were often in his mind, and he found no &s;olution of the difficulty. But as pre&s;ents and civilities gained him more fami|liarity, he found that almo&s;t every man that &s;tood high in employment hated all the re&s;t, and was hated by them, and that their lives were a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of plots and detec|tions, &s;tratagems and e&s;capes, faction and treachery. Many of tho&s;e, who &s;urrounded the Ba&s;&s;a, were &s;ent only to watch and report his conduct; every tongue was muttering cen|&s;ure, and every eye was &s;earching for a fault.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the letters of revocation arrived, the Ba&s;&s;a was carried in chains to Con&s;tantinople, and his name was mentioned no more.</P>
<P>"What are we now to think of the prero|gatives of power, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas to his &s;i&s;ter; is it without any efficacy to good? or, is the &s;ubordinate degree only dangerous, and the &s;upreme &s;afe and glorious? Is the Sultan the only happy man in his dominions? or, is the Sultan him&s;elf &s;ubject to the torments of &s;u&s;|picion, and the dread of enemies?"</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time the &s;econd Ba&s;&s;a was depo&s;ed. The Sultan, that had advanced him, was mur|dered by the Jani&s;aries, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or had other views and different favourites.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. The prince&s;s pur&s;ues her enquiry with more diligence than &s;ucce&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THE prince&s;s in the mean time, in&s;inuated her&s;elf into many families; for there are few doors, through which liberality, joined with good humour, cannot find its way. The daughters of many hou&s;es were airy and chear|ful, but Nekayah had been too long accu&s;|tomed to the conver&s;ation of Imlac, and her brother, to be much plea&s;ed with childi&s;h levity and prattle which had no meaning. She found their thoughts narrow, their wi&s;hes low, and their merriment often artificial. Their plea|&s;ures, poor as they were, could not be pre|&s;erved pure, but were embittered by petty com|petitions and worthle&s;s emulation. They were always jealous of the beauty of each other; of a quality to which &s;olicitude can add nothing, and from which detraction can take nothing away. Many were in love with triflers like them&s;elves, and many fancied that they were in love when in truth they were only idle. Their affection was &s;eldom fixed on &s;en&s;e or virtue, and therefore &s;eldom ended but in vexa|tion. Their grief, however, like their joy, was tran&s;ient; every thing floated in their mind unconnected with the pa&s;t or future, &s;o that one de&s;ire ea&s;ily gave way to another, as a &s;econd &s;tone ca&s;t into the water effaces and confounds the circles of the fir&s;t.</P>

With the&s;e girls &s;he played as with inoffen|&s;ive animals, and found them proud of her countenance, and weary of her company.</P>
<P>But her purpo&s;e was to examine more deeply, and her affability ea&s;ily per&s;uaded the hearts that were &s;welling with &s;orrow to di&s;charge their &s;ecrets in her ear: and tho&s;e whom hope flattered, or pro&s;perity delighted, often courted her to partake of their plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s and her brother commonly met in the evening in a private &s;ummer-hou&s;e on the bank of the Nile, and related to each other the occurrences of the day. As they were &s;itting together, the prince&s;s ca&s;t her eyes upon the river that flowed before her. "An|&s;wer, &s;aid &s;he, great father of waters, thou that rolle&s;t thy floods through eighty nations, to the invocations of the daughter of thy native king. Tell me if thou watere&s;t, through all thy cour&s;e, a &s;ingle habitation from which thou do&s;t not hear the murmurs of complaint?"</P>
<P>"You are then, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, not more &s;ucce&s;sful in private hou&s;es than I have been in courts." "I have, &s;ince the la&s;t partition of our provinces, &s;aid the prince&s;s, enabled my|&s;elf to enter familiarly into many families, where there was the faire&s;t &s;how of pro&s;perity and peace, and know not one hou&s;e that is not haunted by &s;ome fiend that de&s;troys its quiet.</P>

"I did not &s;eek ea&s;e among the poor, be|cau&s;e I concluded that there it could not be found. But I &s;aw many poor whom I had &s;uppo&s;ed to live in affluence. Poverty has, in large cities, very different appearances: it is often concealed in &s;plendor, and often in ex|travagance. It is the care of a very great part of mankind to conceal their indigence from the re&s;t: they &s;upport them&s;elves by temporary expedients, and every day is lo&s;t in contriving for the morrow.</P>
<P>"This, however, was an evil, which, though frequent, I &s;aw with le&s;s pain, becau&s;e I could relieve it. Yet &s;ome have refu&s;ed my bounties; more offended with my quickne&s;s to detect their wants, than plea&s;ed with my readine&s;s to &s;uccour them: and others, who&s;e exigencies compelled them to admit my kind|ne&s;s, have never been able to forgive their benefactre&s;s.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. The prince&s;s continues her remarks upon private life.</HEAD>
<P>NEKAYAH perceiving her brother's attention fixed, proceeded in her narrative.</P>
<P>"In families, where there is or is not po|verty, there is commonly di&s;cord: if a kingdom be, as Imlac tells us, a great family, a family likewi&s;e is a little kingdom, torn with factions and expo&s;ed to revolutions. An unpracti&s;ed ob&s;erver expects the love of parents and child|ren to to be con&s;tant and equal; but this kind|ne&s;s &s;eldom continues beyond the years of in|fancy: in a &s;hort time the children become rivals to their parents. Benefits are allayed by reproaches, and gratitude deba&s;ed by envy.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="010939_0098_0F852963B3DE7140">
"Parents and children &s;eldom act in con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">: each child endeavours to appropriate the e&s;teem or fondne&s;s of the parents, and the par|ents, with yet le&s;s temptation, betray each other to their children; thus &s;ome place their confidence in the father, and &s;ome in the mother, and, by degrees, the hou&s;e is filled with artifices and feuds.</P>
<P>"The opinions of children and parents, of the young and the old, are naturally oppo&s;ite, by the contrary effects of hope and de&s;pon|dence, of expectation and experience, without crime or folly on either &s;ide. The colours of life in youth and age appear different, as the face of nature in &s;pring and winter. And how can children credit the a&s;&s;ertions of parents, which their own eyes &s;how them to be fal&s;e?</P>
<P>"Few parents act in &s;uch a manner as much to enforce their maxims by the credit of their lives. The old man tru&s;ts wholly to &s;low contrivance and gradual progre&s;&s;ion: the youth expects to force his way by genius, vig|our, and precipitance. The old man pays regard to riches, and the youth reverences vir|tue. The old man deifies prudence: the youth commits him&s;elf to magnanimity and chance. The young man, who intends no ill, believes that none is intended, and therefore acts with openne&s;s and candour: but his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,

having &s;uffered the injuries of fraud, is impel|led to &s;u&s;pect, and too often allured to prac|tice it. Age looks with anger on the temerity of youth, and youth with contempt on the &s;cru|pulo&s;ity of age. Thus parents and children, for the greate&s;t part, live on to love le&s;s and le&s;s: and, if tho&s;e whom nature has thus clo&s;ely uni|ted are the torments of each other, where &s;hall we look for tenderne&s;s and con&s;olation?"</P>
<P>"Surely, &s;aid the prince, you mu&s;t have been unfortunate in your choice of acquain|tance: I am unwilling to believe, that the mo&s;t tender of all relations is thus impeded in its effects by natural nece&s;&s;ity."</P>
<P>"Dome&s;tick di&s;cord an&s;wered &s;he, is not inevitably and fatally nece&s;&s;ary; but yet is not ea&s;ily avoided. We &s;eldom &s;ee that a whole family is virtuous: the good and evil cannot well agree; and the evil can yet le&s;s agree with one another: even the virtuous fall &s;ome|times to variance, when their virtues are of different kinds, and tending to extremes. In general tho&s;e parents have mo&s;t reverence who mo&s;t de&s;erve it: for he that lives well cannot be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Many other evils infe&s;t private life. Some are the &s;laves of &s;ervants whom they have tru&s;ted with their affairs. Some are kept in
<PB N="100" REF="010939_0100_0F852964D5F2BE70">
continual anxiety to the caprice of rich re|lations, whom they cannot plea&s;e, and dare not offend. Some hu&s;bands are imperious, and &s;ome wives perver&s;e: and, as it is always more ea&s;y to do evil than good, though the wi&s;dom or virtue of one can very rarely make many happy, the folly or vice of one may often make many mi&s;erable."</P>
<P>"If &s;uch be the general effect of marriage, &s;aid the prince, I &s;hall for the future, think it dangerous to connect my intere&s;t with that of another, le&s;t I &s;hould be unhappy by my partner's fault."</P>
<P>"I have met, &s;aid the prince&s;s, with many who live &s;ingle for that rea&s;on; but I never found that their prudence ought to rai&s;e envy. They dream away their time without friend&s;hip, without fondne&s;s, and are driven to rid them|&s;elves of the day, for which they have no u&s;e, by childi&s;h amu&s;ements, or vicious delights. They act as beings under the con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of &s;ome known inferiority, that fills their minds with rancour, and their tongues with cen&s;ure. They are peevi&s;h at home, and ma|levolent abroad; and, as the out-laws of hu|man nature, make it their bu&s;ine&s;s and their plea&s;ure to di&s;turb that &s;ociety which debars them from its privileges. To live without feeling or exciting &s;ympathy, to be fortunate
<PB N="101" REF="010939_0101_0F852965A94E7A68">
without adding to the felicity of others, or afflicted without ta&s;ting the balm of pity, is a &s;tate more gloomy than &s;olitude: it is not re|treat but exclu&s;ion from mankind. Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no plea|&s;ures."</P>
<P>"What then is to be done? &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas; the more we enquire, the le&s;s we can re&s;olve. Surely he is mo&s;t likely to plea&s;e him&s;elf that has no other inclination to regard."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. Di&s;qui&s;ition upon greatne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THE conver&s;ation had a &s;hort pau&s;e. The prince, having con&s;idered his &s;i&s;ter's ob|&s;ervations, told her, that &s;he had &s;urveyed life with prejudice, and &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;ery where &s;he did not find it "Your narrative, &s;ays he, throws yet a darker gloom upon the pro&s;pects of futurity: the predictions of Imlac were but faint &s;ketches of the evils painted by Nekayah. I have been lately convinced that quiet is not the daughter of grandeur, or of power: that her pre&s;ence is not to be bought by wealth, nor enforced by conque&s;t. It is evident, that as any man acts in a wider compa&s;s, he mu&s;t be more expo&s;ed to oppo&s;ition from enmity or mi&s;carriage from chance; whoever has many

to plea&s;e or to govern, mu&s;t u&s;e the mini&s;try of many agents, &s;ome of whom will be wicked, and &s;ome ignorant; by &s;ome he will be mi&s;led, and by others betrayed. If he gratifies one he will offend another: tho&s;e that are not favoured will think them&s;elves injured; and, &s;ince fa|vours can be conferred but upon few, the greater number will be always di&s;contented."</P>
<P>"The di&s;contents &s;aid the prince&s;s, which is thus unrea&s;onable, I hope that I &s;hall always have &s;pirit to de&s;pi&s;e, and you power to repre&s;s."</P>
<P>"Di&s;content, an&s;wered Ra&s;&s;elas, will not always be without rea&s;on under the mo&s;t ju&s;t or vigilant admini&s;tration of public affairs. None, however attentive, can always di&s;cover that merit which indigence or faction may happen to ob&s;cure; and none however power|ful, can always reward it. Yet, he that &s;ees inferior de&s;ert advanced above him, will natu|rally impute that preference to partiality or caprice; and, indeed, it can &s;carcely be hoped that any man, however magnanimous by nature, or exalted by condition, will be able to per&s;i&s;t for ever in fixed and inexorable ju&s;tice of di&s;|tribution: he will &s;ometimes indulge his own affections, and &s;ometimes tho&s;e of his favour|rites; he will permit &s;ome to plea&s;e him who can never &s;erve him; he will di&s;cover in tho&s;e
<PB N="103" REF="010939_0103_0F852967291A0C88">
whom he loves, qualities which in reality they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s; and to tho&s;e, from whom he receives plea&s;ure, he will in his turn endea|vour to give it. Thus will recommendations &s;ometimes prevail which were purcha&s;ed by money, or by the more de&s;tructive bribery of flattery and &s;ervility."</P>
<P>"He that has much to do will do &s;omething wrong, and of that wrong mu&s;t &s;uffer the con|&s;equences; and, if it were po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould always act rightly, yet when &s;uch num|bers are to judge of his conduct, the bad will cen&s;ure and ob&s;truct him by malevolence, and the good &s;ometimes by mi&s;take.</P>
<P>"The highe&s;t &s;tations cannot therefore hope to be the abodes of happine&s;s, which I would willingly believe to have fled from thrones and palaces to &s;eats of humble privacy and placid ob&s;curity. For what can hinder the &s;atisfacti|on, or intercept the expectations, of him who&s;e abilities are adequate to his employments, who &s;ees with his own eyes the whole circuit of his influence, who choo&s;es by his own know|ledge all whom he tru&s;ts, and whom none are tempted to deceive by hope or fear? Surely he has nothing to do but to love and to be loved, to be virtuous and to be happy."</P>
<P>"Whether perfect happine&s;s would be pro|cured
<PB N="104" REF="010939_0104_0F852967DB296E20">
by perfect goodne&s;s, &s;aid Nekayah, this world will never afford an opportunity of de|ciding. But this, at lea&s;t, may be maintained, that we do not always find vi&s;ible happine&s;s in proportion to vi&s;ible virtue. All natural and al|mo&s;t all political evils are incident alike to the bad and good: they are confounded in the mi&s;ery of a famine, and not much di&s;tingui&s;hed in the fury of a faction; they &s;ink together in a tempe&s;t, and are driven together from their country by invaders. All that virtue can afford is quietne&s;s of con&s;cience, a &s;teady pro|&s;pect of a happier &s;tate; this may enable us to endure calamity with patience; but remember that patience mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e pain."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. Ra&s;&s;elas and Nekayah continue their Conver&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P>"DEAR prince&s;s, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, you fall into the common errors of exaggera|tory declamation, by producing, in a familiar di&s;qui&s;ition, examples of national calamities, and &s;cenes of exten&s;ive mi&s;ery, which are found in books rather than in the world, and which, as they are horrid, are ordained to be rare. Let us not imagine evils, which we do not feel, nor injure life by mi&s;repre&s;entations. I cannot bear that querulous eloquence which
<PB N="105" REF="010939_0105_0F85296911BB2770">
threatens every city with a &s;iege like that of Jeru&s;alem, that makes famine attend on every flight of locu&s;ts, and &s;u&s;pends pe&s;tilence on the wings of every bla&s;t that i&s;&s;ues from the &s;outh.</P>
<P>"On nece&s;&s;ary and inevitable evils, which overwhelm kingdoms at once, all di&s;putation is vain: when they happen they mu&s;t be en|dured. But it is evident, that the&s;e bur&s;ts of univer&s;al di&s;tre&s;s are more dreaded than felt: thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands, flouri&s;h in youth, and wither in age, without the knowledge of any other than dome&s;tick evils, and &s;hare the &s;ame plea&s;ures and vexations whether their kings are mild or cruel, whether the armies of their country pur&s;ue their enemies, or retreat before them. While courts are di&s;turbed with inte&s;tine competitions, and emba&s;&s;adors are negotiating in foreign countries, the &s;mith &s;till plies his anvil, and the hu&s;bandman drives his plow forward; the nece&s;&s;aries of life are required and obtained, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons continues to make its wonted revolutions."</P>

<P>"I know not, &s;aid the prince&s;s, whether marriage be more than one of the innumera|ble modes of human mi&s;ery.

<P>"You &s;eem to forget, replied Ra&s;&s;elas, that you have, even now, repre&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed celibacy as le&s;s happy than marriage. Both conditions may be bad, but they cannot both be wor&s;t. Thus

it happens when wrong opinions are entertain|ed, that they mutually de&s;troy each other, and leave the mind open to truth."</P>
<P>"I did not expect, an&s;wered the prince&s;s to hear that imputed to fal&s;ehood which is the con&s;equence only of frailty. To the mind, as to the eye, it is difficult to compare with ex|actne&s;s objects va&s;t in their extent, and various in their parts. Where we &s;ee or conceive the whole at once we readily note the di&s;criminati|ons and decide the preference: but of two &s;y&s;tems, of which neither can be &s;urveyed by any human being in its full compa&s;s of magni|tude and multiplicity of complication, where is the wonder, that judging of the whole by parts, I am affected by one or the other as either pre&s;&s;es on my memory or fancy? We differ from our&s;elves ju&s;t as we differ from each other, when we &s;ee only part of the que&s;tion, as in the multifarious relations of politicks and morality: but when we perceive the whole at once, as in numerical computations, all agree in one judgement, and none ever varles his opinion."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. The debate on marriage continued.</HEAD>
<P>"THE good of the whole &s;ays Ra&s;&s;elas, is the &s;ame with the good of all its parts. If marriage be be&s;t for mankind it mu&s;t be evidently be&s;t for individuals, or a permanent and nece&s;&s;ary duty mu&s;t be the cau&s;e of evil, and &s;ome mu&s;t be inevitably &s;acrificed to the convenience of others. In the e&s;timate which you have made of the two &s;tates, it ap|pears that the incommodities of a &s;ingle life are, in a great mea&s;ure, nece&s;&s;ary and, certain, but tho&s;e of the conjugal &s;tate accidental and avoidable.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="010939_0109_0F85296D3113DF90">
"I cannot forbear to flatter my&s;elf that prudence and benevolence will make marriage happy. The general folly of mankind is the cau&s;e of general complaint. What can be expected but di&s;appointment and repentance from a choice made in the immaturity of youth, in the ardour of de&s;ire, without judgment, without fore&s;ight, without enquiry after con|formity of opinions, &s;imilarity of manners, rectitude of judgment, or purity of &s;entiment.</P>
<P>"Such is the common proce&s;s of marriage. A youth and maiden meeting by chance, or brought together by artifice, exchange glances, reciprocate civilities, go home, and dream of one another. Having little to divert attention, or diver&s;ity of thought, they find them&s;elves unea&s;y when they are apart, and therefore con|clude that they &s;hall be happy together. They marry, and di&s;cover what nothing but voluntary blindne&s;s had before concealed; they wear out life in altercations, and charge nature with cruelty.</P>
<P>"From tho&s;e early marriages proceeds likewi&s;e the rivalry of parents and children: the &s;on is eager to enjoy the world before the father is willing to for&s;ake it, and there is hardly room at once for two generations. The daughters begins to bloom before the mother
<PB N="110" REF="010939_0110_0F85296DD8EE2808">
can be content to fade, and neither can forbear to wi&s;h for the ab&s;ence of the other.</P>
<P>"Surely all the&s;e evils may be avoided by that deliberation and delay which prudence pre&s;cribes to irrevocable choice. In the variety and jollity of youthful plea&s;ures, life may be well enough &s;upported without the help of a partner. Longer time will encrea&s;e experience, and wider views will allow better opportunities of enquiry and &s;election: one advantage, at lea&s;t, will be certain; the parents will be vi&s;ibly older than their children."</P>
<P>"What rea&s;on cannot collect, &s;aid Nekayah, and what experiment has not yet taught, can be known only from the report of others. I have been told that late marriages are not emi|nently happy. This is a que&s;tion too impor|tant to be neglected, and I have often pro|po&s;ed it to tho&s;e, who&s;e accuracy of remark, and comprehen&s;ivene&s;s of knowledge, made their &s;uffrages worthy of regard. They have generally determined, that it is dangerous for a man and woman to &s;u&s;pend their fate upon each other, at a time when opinions are fixed, and habits are e&s;tabli&s;hed; when friend&s;hips have been contracted on both &s;ides, when life has been planned into method, and the mind has long enjoyed the contemplation of its own pro&s;pects.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="010939_0111_0F8529739B2C0A18">
"It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that two travelling through the world under the conduct of chance, &s;hould have been both directed to the &s;ame path, and it will not often happen that either will quit the track which cu&s;tom has made plea&s;ing. When the de&s;ultory levity of youth has &s;ettled into regularity, it is &s;oon &s;ucceeded by pride a&s;hamed to yield, or ob&s;ti|nacy delighting to contend. And even though mutual e&s;teem produces mutual de&s;ires to plea&s;e, time it&s;elf as it modifies unchangeably the external mien, determines likewi&s;e the direction of the pa&s;&s;ions, and gives an inflexible rigidity to the manners. Long cu&s;toms are not ea&s;ily broken: he that attempts to change the cour&s;e of his own life, very often labours in vain; and how &s;hall we do that for others, which we are &s;eldom able to do for our&s;elves."</P>
<P>"But &s;urely, interpo&s;ed the prince, you &s;uppo&s;e the chief motive of choice forgotten or neglected. Whenever I &s;hall &s;eek a wife, it &s;hall be my fir&s;t que&s;tion, whether &s;he be will|ing to be led by rea&s;on."</P>
<P>"Thus it is, &s;aid Nekayah, that philo&s;o|phers are deceived. There are a thou&s;and familiar di&s;putes which rea&s;on never can de|cide; que&s;tions that elude inve&s;tigation, and make logick ridiculous; ca&s;es where &s;omething mu&s;t be done, and where little can be &s;aid.

Con&s;ider the &s;tate of mankind, and enquire how few can be &s;uppo&s;ed to act upon any occa&s;ion whether &s;mall or great, with all the rea&s;ons of action pre&s;ent to their minds. Wretched would be the pair above all names of wretchedne&s;s, who &s;hould be doomed to adju&s;t by rea&s;on every morning all the minute detail of a dome&s;tick day.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e who marry at an advanced age, will probably e&s;cape the encroachments of their children; but, in diminution of this advantage, they will be likely to leave them, ignorant and helple&s;s, to a guardian's mercy: or, if that &s;hould not happen, they mu&s;t at lea&s;t go out of the world before they &s;ee tho&s;e whom they love be&s;t either wi&s;e or great.</P>
<P>"From their children, if they have le&s;s to fear, they have le&s;s al&s;o to hope, and they lo&s;e, without equivalent, the joys of early love, and the convenience of uniting with manners pliant, and minds &s;u&s;ceptible of new impre&s;&s;ions, which might wear away their di&s;&s;imilitudes by long cohabitation, as &s;oft bodies, by continual attrition, conform their &s;urfaces to each other.</P>
<P>"I believe it will be found that tho&s;e who marry late are be&s;t plea&s;ed with their children, and tho&s;e who marry early with their partners."</P>

"The union of the&s;e two affections, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, would produce all that could be wi&s;hed. Perhaps there is a time when marriage might unite them, a time neither too early for the father, nor too late for the hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"Every hour, an&s;wered the prince&s;s, con|firms my prejudice in favour of the po&s;ition &s;o often uttered by the mouth of Imlac, 'That nature &s;ets her gifts on the right hand and on the left." Tho&s;e conditions, which flatter hope and attract de&s;ire, are &s;o con&s;tituted, that, as we approach one, we recede from another. There are goods &s;o oppo&s;ed that we cannot &s;eize both, but, by too much prudence, may pa&s;s between them at too great a di&s;tance to reach either. This is often the fate of long con&s;ideration; he does nothing who endea|vours to do more than is allowed to humanity. Flatter not your&s;elf with contrarieties of plea|&s;ure. Of the ble&s;&s;ings &s;et before you make your choice, and be content.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. Imlac enters, and changes the conver&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P>HERE Imlac entered, and interrupted them. His look was clouded with thought. "Imlac, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, I have been hearing from the prince&s;s the di&s;mal hi&s;tory of private life, and am almo&s;t di&s;couraged from further &s;earch."</P>
<P>"It &s;eems to me, &s;aid Imlac, that while you are making the choice of life, you ne|glect to live. You wander about a &s;ingle city, which, however large and diver&s;ified, can now afford few novelties, and forget that you are in a country, famous among the earlie&s;t monarchies for the power and wi&s;dom of its inhabitants: a country where the &s;ciences fir&s;t dawned that illuminate the world, and beyond which the arts cannot be traced of civil &s;ociety or dome&s;tick life.</P>
<P>"The old Egyptians have left behind them monuments of Indu&s;try and power before which all European magnificence is confe&s;&s;ed to fade away. The ruins of their architecture are the &s;chools of modern builders, and from the won|ders which time has &s;pared we may conjecture, though uncertainly, what it has de&s;troyed."</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="010939_0115_0F8529771B790CF0">
"My curio&s;ity, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, does not very &s;trongly lead me to &s;urvey piles of &s;tone, or mounds of earth; my bu&s;ine&s;s is with man. I came hither not to mea&s;ure fragments of temples, or trace choaked aqueducts, but to look upon the various &s;cenes of the pre&s;ent world."</P>
<P>"The things that are now before us, &s;aid the prince&s;s, nece&s;&s;arily require attention, and &s;ufficiently de&s;erve it.

<P>"To know any thing, returned the poet, we mu&s;t know its effects; to &s;ee men we mu&s;t &s;ee their works, that we may learn what rea&s;on has dictated, or pa&s;&s;ion has incited, and find what are the mo&s;t powerful motives of action. To judge rightly of the pre&s;ent we mu&s;t oppo&s;e it to the pa&s;t; for all judgement is compara|tive, and of the future nothing can be known. The truth is, that no mind is much employed upon the pre&s;ent: recollection and anticipation fill up almo&s;t all our moments. Our pa&s;&s;ions are joy and grief, love and hatred, hope and fear. Of joy and grief the pa&s;t is the object and the future of hope and fear; even love and

<P>"The pre&s;ent &s;tate of things is the con&s;e|quence of the former, and it is natural to in|quire what were the &s;ources of the good that we enjoy, or of the evil that we &s;uffer. If we act only for our&s;elves, to neglect the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, is not prudent: if we are entru&s;ted with the cares of others, it is not ju&s;t. Igno|rance, when it is voluntary, is criminal; and he may properly be charged with evil, who refu&s;ed to learn how he might prevent it.</P>
<P>"There is no part of hi&s;tory &s;o generally u&s;eful as that which relates the progre&s;s of the human mind, the gradual improvement of rea|&s;on, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive advances of &s;cience, the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of learning and ignorance, which are the light and darkne&s;s of thinking beings, the extinction and re&s;u&s;citation of arts, and all the revolutions of the intellectual world. If ac|counts of battles and inva&s;ions are peculiarly the bu&s;ine&s;s of princes, the u&s;eful or elegant arts, are not to be neglected; tho&s;e who have kingdoms to govern, have under&s;tandings to cultivate.</P>

<P>"When they came to the great pyramid they were a&s;toni&s;hed at the extent of the ba&s;e, and the height of the top. Imlac explained to them the principles upon which the pyramidi|cal form was cho&s;en for a fabrick intended to co-extend its duration with that of the world: he &s;howed that its gradual diminution gave it &s;uch &s;tability, as defeated all the common at|tacks of the elements, and could &s;carcely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> overthrown by earthquakes them&s;elves, the ea&s;t re&s;i&s;tible of natural violence.

<P>They mea&s;ured all its dimen&s;ions, and pitch|ed their tents at its foot. Next day they pre|pared to enter its interior apartments, and having hired the common guides climbed up to the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age, when the favourite of the prince&s;s, looking into the cavity, &s;tepped back and trembled. "Pekuah, &s;aid the prince&s;s, of what art thou afraid?" "Of the narrow entrance, an&s;wered the lady, and of the dread|ful gloom.

<P>"Yet I do not mean to add new terrors to tho&s;e which have already &s;eized upon Pekuah. There can be no rea&s;on why &s;pectres &s;hould haunt the pyramid more than other places, or why they &s;hould have power or will to hurt innocence and purity.

<P>"My dear Pekuah, &s;aid the prince&s;s, I will always go before you, and Imlac &s;hall follow you. Remember that you are the companion of the prince&s;s of Abi&s;&s;inia."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII. The prince&s;s meets with an unexpected misfortune.</HEAD>
<P>THEY ro&s;e up, and returned through the cavity at which they had entered, and the prince&s;s prepared for her favourite a long narrative of dark labyrinths, and co&s;tly rooms, and of the different impre&s;&s;ions which the varieties of the way had made upon her. But, when they came to their train, they found every one &s;ilent and dejected: the men di&s;covered &s;hame and fear in their countenances, and the women were weeping in the tents.</P>
<P>What had happened they did not try to conjecture, but immediately enquired. "You had &s;carcely entered into the pyramid, &s;aid one of the attendants, when a troop of Arabs ru&s;hed upon us: we were too few to re&s;i&s;t
<PB N="124" REF="010939_0124_0F85297DA91D5078">
them, and too &s;low to e&s;cape. They were about to &s;earch the tents, &s;et us on our camels, and drive us along before them, when the ap|proach of &s;ome Turki&s;h hor&s;emen put them to flight; but they &s;eized the lady Pekuah with her two maids, and carried them away: the Turks are now pur&s;uing them by our in&s;ti|gation, but I fear they will not be able to overtake them."</P>
<P>"The prince&s;s was overpowered with &s;ur|pri&s;e and grief. Ra&s;&s;elas in the fir&s;t heat of his re&s;entment, ordered his &s;ervants to follow him and prepared to pur&s;ue the robbers with his &s;a|bre in his hand. "Sir, &s;aid Imlac, what can you hope from violence or valour? the Arabs are mounted on hor&s;es trained to battle and retreat; we have only bea&s;ts of burthen. By leaving our pre&s;ent &s;tation we may lo&s;e the prince&s;s, but cannot hope to regain Pekuah."</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time the Turks returned, having not been able to reach the enemy. The prince&s;s bur&s;t out into new lamentations, and Ra&s;&s;elas could &s;carcely forbear to reproach them with cowardice; but Imlac was of opinion, that the e&s;cape of the Arabs was no addition to their misfortune, for perhaps, they would have killed their captives rather than have re|&s;igned them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. They return to Cairo without Pekuah.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was nothing to be hoped from longer &s;tay. They returned to Cairo repenting of their curio&s;ity, cen&s;uring the negligence of the government, lamenting their own ra&s;hne&s;s which had neglected to procure a guard, imagining many expedients, by which the lo&s;s of Pekuah might have been prevented, and re&s;olving to do &s;omething for her recovery, though none could find any thing proper to be done.</P>
<P>Nekayah retired to her chamber where her women attempted to comfort her, by telling her that all had their troubles, and that lady Pekuah had enjoyed much happine&s;s in the world for a long time, and might rea&s;onably expect a change of fortune. They hoped that &s;ome good would befal her where&s;oever &s;he was, and that their mi&s;tre&s;s would find another friend who might &s;upply her place.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s made them no an&s;wer, and they continued the form of condolance, not much grieved in their hearts that the favourite was lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="010939_0126_0F85297F18DB6358">
Next day the prince pre&s;ented to the Ba&s;&s;a a memorial of the wrong which he had &s;uffered, and a petition for redre&s;s. The Ba&s;&s;a threatened to puni&s;h the robbers, but did not attempt to catch them, nor, indeed, could any account or de&s;cription to given by which he might di|rect the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>It &s;oon appeared that nothing would be done by authority. Governors, being ac|cu&s;tomed to hear of more crimes than they can puni&s;h, and more wrongs than they can redre&s;s, &s;et them&s;elves at ea&s;e by indi&s;crimi|nate negligence, and pre&s;ently forget the reque&s;t where they lo&s;e &s;ight of the petitioner.</P>
<P>Imlac then endeavoured to gain &s;ome in|telligence by private agents. He found many who pretended to an exact knowledge of all the haunts of the Arabs, and to regular corre&s;|pondence with their chiefs, and who readily undertook the recovery of Pekuah. Of the&s;e, &s;ome were furni&s;hed with money for their journey, and came back no more; &s;ome were liberally paid for accounts which a few days di&s;covered to be fal&s;e. But the prince&s;s would not &s;uffer any means however, improbable to be left untried. While &s;he was doing &s;ome|thing &s;he kept her hope alive as one expedi|ent failed, another was &s;ugge&s;ted; when one me&s;&s;enger returned un&s;ucce&s;sful, another was di&s;patched to a different quarter.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="010939_0127_0F85297FD8BF3868">
Two months had now pa&s;&s;ed, and of Pe|kuah nothing had been heard; the hopes which they had endeavoured to rai&s;e in each other grew more languid, and the prince&s;s when &s;he &s;aw nothing more to be tried, &s;unk down incon&s;olable in hopele&s;s dejection. A thou&s;and times &s;he reproached her&s;elf with the ea&s;y com|pliance by which &s;he permitted her favourite to &s;tay behind her. "Had not my fondne&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, le&s;&s;ened my authority, Pekuah had not dared to talk of her terrors. She ought to have feared me more than &s;pectres. A &s;evere look would have overpowered her; a peremptory command would have compelled obedience. Why did fooli&s;h indulgence pre|vail upon me? Why did I not &s;peak and refu&s;e to hear?"</P>
<P>"Great prince&s;s, &s;aid Imlac, do not re|proach your&s;elf for your virtue, or con&s;ider that as blameable by which evil has acciden|tally been cau&s;ed. Your tenderne&s;s for the timidity of Pekuah was generous and kind. When we act according to our duty, we com|mit the event to him by who&s;e laws our actions are governed, and who will &s;uffer none to be finally puni&s;hed for obedience.

Man cannot &s;o far know the connection of cau&s;es and events, as that he may venture to do wrong in order to do right. When we pur&s;ue our end by lawful means, we may always con&s;ole our mi&s;carriage by the hope of future recompence.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV. The prince&s;s continues to lament Pekuah.</HEAD>
<P>NEKAYAH, being thus reconciled to her&s;elf, found that no evil is in&s;up|portable but that which is accompanied with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of wrong. She was, from that time, delivered from the violence of tempe&s;|tuous &s;orrow, and &s;unk into &s;ilent pen&s;ivene&s;s and gloomy tranquillity. She &s;at from morn|ing to evening recollecting all that had been done or &s;aid by her Pekuah, trea&s;ured up with care every trifle on which Pekuah had &s;et an accidental value, and which might re|call to mind any little incident or carele&s;s conver&s;ation. The &s;entiments of her, whom &s;he now expected to &s;ee no more, were trea&s;ured up in her memory as rules of life, and &s;he deliberated to no other end than to conjecture on any occa&s;ion, what would have been the opinion and coun&s;el of Pekuah.</P>
<P>The women by whom &s;he was attended, knew nothing of her real condition, and there|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> &s;he could not talk to them but with cauti|on and re&s;erve. She began to remit her curio&s;ity,
<PB N="130" REF="010939_0130_0F85298371B94368">
having no great care to collect notions which &s;he had no convenience of uttering. Ra&s;&s;elas endeavoured fir&s;t to comfort and afterwards to divert her; he hired mu&s;icians, to whom &s;he &s;eemed to li&s;ten, but did not hear them, and procured ma&s;ters to in&s;truct her in various arts, who&s;e lectures, when they vi&s;ited her again, were again to be repeated. She had lo&s;t her ta&s;te of plea&s;ure and her ambition of excellence. And her mind, though forced into &s;hort excur&s;ions, always recurred to the image of her friend.</P>
<P>Imlac was every morning earne&s;tly enjoined to renew his enquiries, and was a&s;ked every night whether he had yet heard of Pekuah, till not being able to return the prince&s;s the an&s;wer that &s;he de&s;ired, he was le&s;s and le&s;s willing to come into her pre&s;ence. She ob|&s;erved his backwardne&s;s, and commanded him to attend her. "You are not, &s;aid &s;he, to confound impatience with re&s;entment, or to &s;uppo&s;e that I charge you with negligence, becau&s;e I repine at your un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s. I do not much wonder at your ab&s;ence; I know that the unhappy are never plea&s;ing, and that all naturally avoid the contagion of mi&s;ery. To hear complaints is weari&s;ome alike to the wretched and the happy; for who would cloud by adventitious grief the &s;hort gleams of gaiety which life allows us? or who, that is
<PB N="131" REF="010939_0131_0F852984210629A0">
&s;truggling under his own evils, will add to them the mi&s;eries of another?</P>
<P>"The time is at hand, when none &s;hall be di&s;turbed any longer by the &s;ighs of Nekayah: my &s;earch after happine&s;s is now at an end. I am re&s;olved to retire from the world with all its flatteries and deceits, and will hide my&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in &s;olitude, without any other care than to compo&s;e my thoughts, and regulate my hours by a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of innocent occupations, till with a mind purified from all earthly de&s;ires, I &s;hall enter into that &s;tate, to which all are ha&s;tening, and in which I hope again to enjoy the friend&s;hip of Pekuah."</P>
<P>"Do not entangle your mind &s;aid Imlac, by irrevocable determinations, nor increa&s;e the burden of life by a voluntary accumulation of mi&s;ery; the wearine&s;s of retirement will con|tinue or increa&s;e when the lo&s;s of Pekuah is forgotten. That you have been deprived of one plea&s;ure is no very good rea&s;on for re|jection of the re&s;t."</P>
<P>"Since Pekuah was taken from me, &s;aid the prince&s;s, I have no plea&s;ure to reject or to retain. She that, has no one to love or tru&s;t has little to hope. She wants the radical principle of happine&s;s. We may per|haps, allow that what &s;atisfaction this world
<PB N="132" REF="010939_0132_0F85298455841268">
can afford, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the conjunction of wealth, knowledge and goodne&s;s: wealth is nothing but as it is be&s;towed, and knowledge nothing but as it is communicated. Goodne&s;s affords the only comfort which can be en|joyed without a partner, and goodne&s;s may be practi&s;ed in retirement."</P>
<P>"How far &s;olitude may admit goodne&s;s, or advance it, I &s;hall not, replied Imlac, di&s;pute at pre&s;ent. Remember the confe&s;&s;ion of the pious hermit. You will wi&s;h to return into the world when the image of your companion has left your thoughts." "That time &s;aid Nekayah, will never come. The generous frankne&s;s, the mode&s;t ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, and the faithful &s;ecrecy of my dear Pekuah, will always be more mi&s;&s;ed as I &s;hall live longer to &s;ee vice and folly."</P>
<P>"The &s;tate of a mind oppre&s;&s;ed with a &s;ud|den calamity, &s;aid Imlac, is like that of the fabulous inhabitants of the new created earth, who, when the fir&s;t night came upon them, &s;uppo&s;ed that the day never would return. When the clouds of &s;orrow gather over us, we &s;ee nothing beyond them, nor can imagine how they will be di&s;pelled: yet a new day &s;ucceeded to the night, and &s;orrow is never long without a dawn of ea&s;e. But they who
<PB N="133" REF="010939_0133_0F8529871B2F7CE8">
re&s;train them&s;elves from receiving comfort, do as the &s;avages would have done, had they put out their eyes when it was dark. Our minds, like our bodies, are in continual flux; &s;omething is hourly lo&s;t, and &s;omething ac|quired. To lo&s;e much at once is inconvenient to either, but while the vital powers remain uninjured, nature will find the means of re|paration. Di&s;tance has the &s;ame effect o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mind as on the eye, and while we glide along the &s;tream of time, whatever we leave be|hind us is always le&s;&s;ening, and that which we approach increa&s;ing in magnitude. Do not &s;uffer life to &s;tagnate; it will grow mud|dy for want of motion: commit your&s;elf again to the current of the world; The remem|brance of Pekuah will vani&s;h by degrees; you will meet in your way &s;ome other favourite, or learn to diffu&s;e your&s;elf in general conver|&s;ation."</P>
<P>"At lea&s;t, &s;aid the prince, do not de&s;pair before all remedies have been tried: the enquiry after the unfortunate lady is &s;till con|tinued, and &s;hall be carried on with yet greater diligence, on condition that you will promi&s;e to wait a year for the event, without any un|alterable re&s;olution."</P>
<P>Nekayah thought this a rea&s;onable demand, and made the promi&s;e to her brother, who had been advi&s;ed by Imlac, to require <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="134" REF="010939_0134_0F852987923DA1C8">

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. Pekuah is &s;till remembered by the prince&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>NEKAYAH, &s;eeing that nothing was omitted for the recovery of her favourite, and having by her promi&s;e, &s;et her intention of retirement at a di&s;tance began impercepti|bly to return to common cares and common plea&s;ures. She rejoiced without her own con|&s;ent at the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of her &s;orrows, and &s;ometimes caught her&s;elf with indignation in the act of turning away her mind from the remembrance of her, whom yet &s;he re&s;olved never to forget.</P>
<P>She then appointed a certain hour of the day for meditation on the merits and fondne&s;s of Pekuah, and for &s;ome weeks retired con|&s;tantly at the time fixed, and returned with her eyes &s;wollen and her countenance clouded. By degrees &s;he grew le&s;s &s;crupulous, and &s;uf|fered any important and pre&s;&s;ing avocation to delay the tribute of daily tears. She then yielded to le&s;s occa&s;ions; &s;ometimes forgot what &s;he was indeed afraid to remember, and

at la&s;t, wholly relea&s;ed her&s;elf from the duty of periodical affliction.</P>
<P>Her real love of Pekuah was yet not di|mini&s;hed. A thou&s;and occurrences brought her back to memory, and a thou&s;and wants, which nothing but the confidence of friend&s;hip can &s;upply, made her frequently regretted. She, therefore, &s;olicited Imlac never to de|&s;i&s;t from inquiry, and to leave no art of in|telligence untried, that at lea&s;t, &s;he might have the comfort of knowing, that &s;he did not &s;uf|fer by negligence or &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s. "Yet what, &s;aid &s;he, is to be expected from our pur&s;uit of happine&s;s, when we find the &s;tate of life to be &s;uch, that happine&s;s it&s;elf is the cau&s;e of mi&s;ery?

<P>IN &s;even months, one of the me&s;&s;engers, who had been &s;ent away upon the day when the promi&s;e was drawn from the prince&s;s, returned, after many un&s;ucce&s;sful rambles, from the
<PB N="136" REF="010939_0136_0F852988DA359070">
borders of Nubia, with an account that Pekuah was in the hands of an Arab chief, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a ca&s;tle or fortre&s;s on the extremity of Egypt. The Arab, who&s;e revenue was plun|der, was willing to re&s;tore her, with her two attendants, for two hundred ounces of gold.</P>
<P>The price was no &s;ubject of debate. The prince&s;s was in exta&s;ies when &s;he heard that her favourite was alive, and might &s;o cheaply be ran&s;omed. She could not think of delaying for a moment Pekuah's happine&s;s or her own, but entreated her brother to &s;end back the me&s;&s;enger with the &s;um required. Imlac, being con&s;ulted, was not very confident of the veracity of the relator, and was &s;till more doubtful of the Arab's faith, who might, if he were too liberally tru&s;ted, detain at once the money and the captives. He thought it dangerous to put them&s;elves in the power of the Arab, by going into his di&s;trict, and could not expect that the Arab would &s;o much expo&s;e him&s;elf as to come into the lower coun|try, where he might be &s;eized by the forces of the Ba&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>It is difficult to negotiate where neither will tru&s;t. But Imlac, after &s;ome deliberation, directed the me&s;&s;enger to propo&s;e that Pekuah &s;hould be conducted by ten hor&s;emen to the
<PB N="137" REF="010939_0137_0F85298E68758370">

<P>That no time might be lo&s;t, as they expected that the propo&s;al would not be refu&s;ed, they immediately began their journey to the mona&s;tery; and, when they arrived, Imlac went forward with the former me&s;&s;enger to the Arab's fortre&s;s. Ra&s;&s;elas was de&s;irous to go with them, but neither his &s;i&s;ter nor Imlac would con&s;ent. The Arab, according to the cu&s;tom of his nation, ob&s;erved the laws of ho&s;pitality with great exactne&s;s to tho&s;e who put them&s;elves into his power, and, in a few days, brought Pekuah with her maids, by ea&s;y journeys, to their place appointed, where he received the &s;tipulated price, and, with great re&s;pect, re&s;tored her to liberty and her friends, and undertook to conduct them back towards Cairo beyond all danger of robbery or violence.</P>

<P>"AT what time, and in what manner, I was forced away &s;aid Pekuah, your &s;ervants have told you.

My confu|&s;ion was increa&s;ed by the &s;peed and tumult of our flight while we were followed by the Turks, who as it &s;eemed, &s;oon de&s;paired to overtake us, or were afraid of tho&s;e whom they made a &s;hew of menacing.</P>
<P>"When the Arabs &s;aw them&s;elves out of danger they &s;lackened their cour&s;e, and, as I was le&s;s harra&s;&s;ed by external violence, I be|gan to feel more unea&s;ine&s;s in my mind.

I was &s;uffered to &s;it with my maids apart from the re&s;t, and none attempted to comfort or in&s;ult us. Here I fir&s;t began to feel the full weight of my mi&s;ery. The girls &s;at weeping in &s;ilence, and from time to time looked up to me for &s;uccour. I knew not to what condition
<PB N="139" REF="010939_0139_0F852990076668C0">
we were doomed, nor could conjecture where would be the place of our captivity, or whence to draw any hope of deliverance. I was in the hands of robbers and &s;avages, and had no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that their pity was more than their ju&s;tice, or that they would for|bear the gratification of any ardour of de&s;ire, or caprice of cruelty.

with any appetite of my own. When the meat was taken away they &s;pread the carpets for repo&s;e.

<P>"In the morning, as I was &s;itting on the gra&s;s, the chief of the troop came towards me: I ro&s;e up to receive him, and he bowed with great re&s;pect. "Illu&s;trious lady, &s;aid he, my fortune is better than I had pre&s;umed to hope; I am told by my women, that I have a prince&s;s in my camp."

"You will ea&s;ily believe that I was plea&s;ed with his courte&s;y; and finding that his predo|minant pa&s;&s;ion was de&s;ire of money, I began now to think my danger le&s;s, for I knew that no &s;um would be thought too great for the relea&s;e of Pekuah. I told him that he &s;hould have no rea&s;on to charge me with ingratitude, if I was u&s;ed with kindne&s;s, and that any ran|&s;ome, which could be expected for a maid of common rank, would be paid, but that he mu&s;t not per&s;i&s;t to rate me as a prince&s;s.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX. The adventures of Pekuah continued.</HEAD>
<P>WE wandered about in this manner for &s;ome weeks, whether, as our chief pretended, for my gratification, or, as I ra|ther &s;u&s;pected, for &s;ome convenience of his own. I endeavoured to appear contented

where &s;ullenne&s;s and re&s;entment would have been of no u&s;e, and that endeavour conduced much to the calmne&s;s of my mind; but my heart was always with Nekayah, and the trou|bles of the night much over-balanced the amu&s;ements of the day. My women, who threw all their cares upon their mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;et their minds at ea&s;e from the time when they &s;aw me treated with re&s;pect, and gave them|&s;elves up to the incidental alleviations of our fatigue without &s;olicitude or &s;orrow. I was plea&s;ed with their plea&s;ure, and animated with their confidence. My condition had lo&s;t much of its terror, &s;ince I found that the Arab ranged the country merely to get riches. Avarice is an uniform and tractable vice: other intellectual di&s;tempers are different in different con&s;titutions of mind; that which &s;ooths the pride of one will offend the pride of another; but to the favour of the covetuous there is a ready way, bring money and nothing is denied.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t we came to the dwelling of our chief, a &s;trong and &s;pacious hou&s;e built with &s;tone in an i&s;land of the Nile, which lies, as I was told, under the tropick. "La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, &s;aid the Arab, you &s;hall re&s;t a few weeks after your journey in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> place, where you are to con&s;ider your&s;elf as &s;overeign My occupation is war: I have therefore cho&s;en this ob&s;cure re&s;idence, from which I can i&s;&s;ue unexpected,

and to which I can retire unpur&s;ued. You may now repo&s;e in &s;ecurity: here are few plea&s;ures, but here is no danger." He then led me into the inner apartments, and &s;eating me in the place of honour bowed to the ground. His women, who con&s;idered me as a rival, looked on me with malignity; but be|ing &s;oon informed that I was a great lady de|tained only for my ran&s;ome, they began to vie with each other in ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and re|verence.</P>
<P>"Being again comforted with new a&s;&s;urances, of &s;peedy liberty, I was for &s;ome days diverted from impatience by the novelty of the place. The turrets overlooked the country to a great di&s;tance, and afforded a view of many windings of the &s;tream. In the day I wandered from one place to another, as the cour&s;e of the &s;un varied the &s;plendor of the pro&s;pect, and &s;aw many things which I had never &s;een before. The crocodiles and river-hor&s;es were common in this unpeopled region, and I often looked upon them with terror, though I knew that they could not hurt me. For &s;ome time I expected to &s;ee merma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ds and tritons, which, as Imlac has told me, the European travellers have &s;tationed in the Nile, but no &s;uch beings ever appeared, and the Arab, when I en|quired after them, laughed at my credulity.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="010939_0146_0F852997171A71A8">
"At night the Arab always attended me to a tower &s;et apart for cele&s;tial ob&s;ervations, where he endeavoured to teach me the names and cour&s;es of the &s;tars. I had no great in|clination to this &s;tudy, but an appearance of attention was nece&s;&s;ary to plea&s;e my in&s;tructor, who valued him&s;elf for his &s;kill, and in a little while, I found &s;ome employment requi&s;ite to beguile the tediou&s;ne&s;s of time, which was to be pa&s;&s;ed always amid&s;t the &s;ame objects. I was weary of looking in the morning on things from which I had turned away weary in the evening: I therefore was at la&s;t willing to ob|&s;erve the &s;tars rather than do nothing, but could not always compo&s;e my thoughts, and was very often thinking on Nekayah when others imagined me contemplating the &s;ky. Soon after the Arab went upon another ex|pedition, and then my only plea&s;ure was to talk with my maids about the accident by which&punc; we were carried away, and the happine&s;s that we &s;hould all enjoy at the end of our captivity.</P>
<P>"There were women in your Arab's fortre&s;s, &s;aid the prince&s;s, why did you not make them your companions, enjoy their conver&s;ation, and partake their diver&s;ions? In a place where they found bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ement, why &s;hould you alone &s;it co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with idle melancholy? or why could not you bear for a few months,
<PB N="147" REF="010939_0147_0F8529981F34A5C0">
that condition to which they were condemned for life?"</P>
<P>"The diver&s;ions of the women, an&s;wered Pekuah, were only childi&s;h play, by which the mind accu&s;tomed to &s;tronger operations could not be kept bu&s;y. I could do all which they delighted in doing by powers merely &s;en|&s;itive, while my intellectual faculties were flown to Cairo. They ran from room to room as a bird hops from wire to wire in his cage. They danced for the &s;ake of motion, as lambs fri&s;k in a meadow. One &s;ometimes pretended to be hurt that the re&s;t might be alarmed, or hid her&s;elf that another might &s;eek her. Part of their time pa&s;&s;ed in watching the progre&s;s of light bodies that floated on the river, and part in marking the various forms into which clouds broke in the &s;ky.</P>
<P>"Their bu&s;ine&s;s was only n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">e-work, in which I and my maids &s;ometimes helped them; but you know that the mind will ea&s;ily &s;traggle from the fingers, nor will you &s;u&s;pect that the captivity and ab&s;ence from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could be much &s;olaced by &s;ilken flowers.</P>
<P>"Nor was much &s;atisfaction to be hoped from their conver&s;ation: for of what could they be expected to talk? They had &s;een nothing;
<PB N="148" REF="010939_0148_0F852998B0647550">
for they had lived from early youth in that narrow &s;pot: of what they had not &s;een they could have no knowledge, for they could not read. They had no ideas but of the few things that were within their view, and had hardly names for any thing but their cloaths and their food. As I bore a &s;uperior character, I was often called to terminate their quarrels, which I decided as equitably as I could. If it could have amu&s;ed me to hear the complaints of each again&s;t the re&s;t, I might have been often detained by long &s;tories, but the motives of their animo&s;ity were &s;o &s;mall, that I could not li&s;ten long without intercepting the tale."</P>
<P>"How, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, can the Arab, whom you repre&s;ented as a man of more than com|mon accompli&s;hments, take any plea&s;ure in his &s;eraglio, when it is filled only with women like the&s;e. Are they exqui&s;itely beautiful?"</P>
<P>"They do not, &s;aid Pekuah, want that unaffecting and ignoble beauty which may &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;priteline&s;s or &s;ublimity, with|out energy of thought or dignity of virtue. But to a man like the Arab &s;uch beauty was only a flower ca&s;ually plucked and carele&s;sly thrown away. Whatever plea&s;ures he might find among them, they were not tho&s;e of friend&s;hip or &s;ociety. When they were play|ing

about him he looked on them with inat|tentive &s;uperiority: when they vied for his regard he &s;ometimes turned away di&s;gu&s;ted. As they had no knowledge, their talk could take nothing from the tediou&s;ne&s;s of life: as they had no choice, their fondne&s;s, or appearance of fondne&s;s, excited in him neither pride nor gratitude; he was not exalted in his own, e&s;teem by the &s;miles of a woman who &s;aw no other man, nor was much obliged by that re|gard, of which he could never know the &s;in|cerity, and which he might often perceive to be exerted not &s;o much to delight him as to pain a rival. That which he gave, and they received, as love, was only a carele&s;s di&s;tribu|tion of &s;uperfluous time, &s;uch love as man can be&s;tow upon that which he de&s;pi&s;es, &s;uch as has neither hope nor fear, neither joy nor &s;orrow."</P>
<P>"You have rea&s;on lady, to think your&s;elf happy, &s;aid Imlac, that you have been thus ea&s;ily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. How could a mind, hungry for knowledge, be willing, in an intellectual famine, to lo&s;e &s;uch a banquet as Pekuah's conver&s;ation?</P>
<P>"I am inclined to believe, an&s;wered Pekuah, that he was for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; for,

notwith&s;tanding his promi&s;e whenever I pro|po&s;ed to di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger to Cairo, he found &s;ome excu&s;e for delay. While I was detained in his hou&s;e he made many incur&s;ions into the neighbouring countries, and, perhaps, he would have refu&s;ed to di&s;charge me, had his plunder been equal to his wi&s;hes. He returned always courteous, related his adven|tures, delighted to hear my ob&s;ervations, and endeavoured to advance my accquaintance with the &s;tars. When I importuned him to &s;end away my letters, he &s;oothed me with profe&s;|&s;ions of honour and &s;incerity; and when I could be no longer decently denied, put his troop again in motion, and left me to govern in his ab&s;ence. I was much afflicted by this &s;tudied procra&s;tination, and was &s;ometimes afraid that I &s;hould be forgotten; that you would leave Cairo, and I mu&s;t end my days in an i&s;land of the Nile.</P>
<P>"I grew at la&s;t hopele&s;s and dejected, and cared &s;o little to entertain him, that he for a while more frequently talked with my maids. That he &s;hould fall in love with them, or with me, might have been equally fatal, and I was not much plea&s;ed with the growing friend&s;hip. My anxiety was not long; for, as I recovered &s;ome degree of chearfulne&s;s, he returned to me, and I could not forbear to de&s;pi&s;e my former unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>THEY returned to Cairo, and were &s;o well plea&s;ed at finding them&s;elves together, that none of them went much abroad.

<P>"Before you make your final choice, an|&s;wered Imlac, you ought to examine its ha|zards, and conver&s;e with &s;ome of tho&s;e who are

I have ju&s;t left the ob&s;ervatory of one of the mo&s;t learned a&s;tronomers in the world, who has &s;pent forty years in unwearied attention to the motions and the appearances of the cele&s;tial bodies, and has drawn out his &s;oul in endle&s;s calculations.

<P>"On the next day of vacation I renewed my vi&s;it, and was &s;o fortunate as to plea&s;e him again. He relaxed from that time the &s;everity of his rule, and permitted me to enter at my own choice. I found him always bu&s;y, and always glad to be relieved. As each knew much which the other was de|&s;irous of learning, we exchanged our notions with great delight. I perceived that I had every day more of his confidence, and always found new cau&s;e of admiration in the pro|fundity of his mind. His comprehen&s;ion

<P>"His integrity and benevolence are equal to his learning.

<P>"I vi&s;ited him, &s;aid Imlac, with more and more frequency, and was every time more enamoured of his conver&s;ation: he was &s;ub|lime without haughtine&s;s, courteous without formality, and communicative without o&s;ten|tation. I was at fir&s;t, Madam, of your opi|ion, thought him the happie&s;t of mankind, and often congratulated him on the ble&s;&s;ing that he enjoyed.

inhabitants of the earth. This contemplation fa&s;tened on my mind, and I &s;at days and nights in imaginary dominion, pouring upon this country and that the &s;howers of fertility, and &s;econding every fall of rain with a due pro|portion of &s;un&s;hine. I had yet only the will to do good, and did not imagine that I &s;hould ever have the power.</P>
<P>"One day as I was looking on the fields withering with heat, I felt in my mind a &s;ud|den wi&s;h that I could &s;end rain on the &s;outhern mountains, and rai&s;e the Nile to an inundati|on. In the hurry of my imagination I com|manded rain to fall, and, by comparing the time of my command, with that of the inun|dation, I found that the clouds had li&s;tened to my lips."</P>
<P>"Might not &s;ome other cau&s;e, &s;aid I, pro|duce this concurrence? the Nile does not al|ways ri&s;e on the &s;ame day."</P>
<P>"Do not believe, &s;aid he with impatience, that &s;uch objections could e&s;cape me: I rea&s;oned long again&s;t my own conviction, and laboured again&s;t truth with the utmo&s;t ob&s;tinacy. I &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected my&s;elf of madne&s;s, and &s;hould not have dared to impart this &s;ecret but to a man like you, capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the wonderful from the impo&s;&s;ible, and the incredible from the fal&s;e."</P>

<P>The prince heard this narration with very &s;erious regard, but the prince&s;s &s;miled, and Pekuah convul&s;ed her&s;elf with laughter. Ladies &s;aid Imlac, to mock the heavie&s;t of human afflictions is neither charitable nor wi&s;e. Few can attain this man's knowledge, and few prac|ti&s;e his virtues, but all may &s;uffer his calamity. Of the uncertainties of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, the mo&s;t dreadful and and alarming is the uncer|tain continuance of rea&s;on."</P>
<P>The prince&s;s was recollected, and the fa|vourite was aba&s;hed. Ra&s;&s;elas, more deeply affected, enquired of Imlac, whether he thought &s;uch maladies of the mind frequent, and how they were contracted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIV. The dangerous prevalence of imagination.</HEAD>
<P>"DISORDERS of intellect, an&s;wered Imlac, happen much more often than &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers will ea&s;ily believe. Per|haps, if we &s;peak with rigorous exactne&s;s, no human mind is in its right &s;tate. There is no man who&s;e imagination does not &s;ome|times predominate over his rea&s;on, who can
<PB N="161" REF="010939_0161_0F8529A7A3C31720">
regulate his attention wholly by his will, and who&s;e ideas will come and go at his command. No man will be found in who&s;e mind airy no|tions do not &s;ometimes tyranni&s;e, and force him to hope or fear beyond the limits of &s;o|ber probability. All power of fancy over rea|&s;on is a degree of in&s;anity but while this power is &s;uch as we can control and repre&s;s, it is not vi&s;ible to others, nor con&s;idered as any depra|vation of the mental faculties: it is not pro|nounced madne&s;s but when it becomes ungo|vernable, and apparently influences &s;peech or action.</P>
<P>"To indulge the power of fiction, and &s;end imagination out upon the wing, is often the &s;port of tho&s;e who delight too much in &s;ilent &s;peculation. When we are alone we are not always bu&s;y; the labour of excogitation is too violent to la&s;t long; the ardour of enquiry will &s;ometimes give way to idlene&s;s or &s;atiety. He who has nothing external that can divert him, mu&s;t find plea&s;ure in his own thoughts, and mu&s;t conceive him&s;elf what he is not; for who is plea&s;ed with what he is? He then expatiates in boundle&s;s futurity, and culls from all imaginable conditions that which for the pre&s;ent moment he &s;hould mo&s;t de&s;ire, amu&s;es his de&s;ires with impo&s;&s;ible en|joyments, and confers upon his pride unattain|able dominion. The mind dances from &s;cene
<PB N="162" REF="010939_0162_0F8529A972B6CDA8">
to &s;cene, unites all plea&s;ures in all combinati|ons, and riots in delights which nature and fortune, with all their bounty, cannot be&s;tow.</P>
<P>"In time &s;ome particular train of ideas fixes the attention, all other intellectual gra|tifications are rejected, the mind, in wearine&s;s or lei&s;ure, recurs con&s;tantly to the favourite conception, and fea&s;ts on the lu&s;cious fal&s;ehood, whenever &s;he is offended with the bitterne&s;s of truth. by degrees the reign of fancy is con|firmed; &s;he grows fir&s;t imperious, and in time de&s;potick. Then fictions begin to operate as realities, fal&s;e opinions fa&s;ten upon the mind and life pa&s;&s;es in dreams of rapture or of angui&s;h.</P>
<P>"This, Sir, is one of the dangers of &s;oli|tude, which the hermit has confe&s;&s;ed not always to promote goodne&s;s, and the a&s;tronomer's mi&s;ery has proved to be not always propitious to wi&s;dom."</P>
<P>"I will no more, &s;aid the favourite, ima|gine my&s;elf the queen of Abi&s;&s;inia. I have often &s;pent the hours, which the prince&s;s gave to my own di&s;po&s;al, in adju&s;ting ceremonies and regulating the court; I have repre&s;&s;ed the pride of the powerful, and granted the petitions of the poor; I have built new palaces in more happy &s;ituations, planted groves upon
<PB N="163" REF="010939_0163_0F8529AA1A201C40">
the tops of mountains, and have exulted in the beneficence of royalty, till, when the prince&s;s entered, I had almo&s;t forgotten to bow down before her."</P>
<P>"And I, &s;aid the prince&s;s, will not allow my&s;elf any more to play the &s;hepherde&s;s in my waking dreams. I have often &s;oothed my thoughts with the quiet and innocence of pa&s;|toral employments, till I have in my cham|ber heard the wind whi&s;tle, and the &s;heep bleat; &s;ometimes freed the lamb entangled in the thicket, and &s;ometimes with my crook encoun|tered the wolf. I have a dre&s;s like that of the village maids, which I put on to help my imagination, and a pipe on which I play &s;oftly, and &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf followed by my flocks."</P>
<P>"I will confe&s;s &s;aid the prince, an indul|gence of fanta&s;tick delight more dangerous than yours. I have frequently endeavoured to image the po&s;&s;ibility of a perfect govern|ment, by which all wrong &s;hould be re&s;trained, all vice reformed, and all the &s;ubjects pre&s;erved in tranquillity and innocence. This thought produced innumerable &s;chemes of reformation, and dictated many u&s;eful regulations and &s;alu|tary edicts. This has been the &s;port and &s;ometimes the labour of my &s;olitude; and I &s;tart, when I think with how little angui&s;h I once &s;uppo&s;ed the death of my father and my brothers."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLV. They di&s;cour&s;e with an old man.</HEAD>
<P>THE evening was now far pa&s;t, and they ro&s;e to return home. As they walked along the bank of the Nile, delighted with the beams of the moon quivering on the water, they &s;aw at a &s;mall di&s;tance an old man, whom, the prince had often heard in the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;ages. "Yonder, &s;aid he, is one who&s;e years have calmed his pa&s;&s;ions, but not clouded his rea&s;on: let us clo&s;e the di&s;qui&s;itions of the night, by enquiring what are his &s;entiments of his own &s;tate, that we may know whether youth alone is to &s;truggle with vexation, and whether any better hope remains for the lat|ter part of life."</P>
<P>Here the &s;age approached and &s;aluted them. They invited him to join their walk, and prat|tled a while as acquaintance that had unexpec|tedly me another. The old man was chear|ful and talkative, and the way &s;eemed &s;hort in his company. He was plea&s;ed to find him|&s;elf
<PB N="165" REF="010939_0165_0F8529AB58F413A8">
not di&s;regarded, accompanied them to their hou&s;e, and, at the prince's reque&s;t, entered with them. They placed him in the &s;eat of honour, and &s;et wine and con&s;erves before him.</P>
<P>"Sir, &s;aid the prince&s;s, an evening walk mu&s;t give to a man of learning, like you, plea|&s;ures which ignorance and youth can hardly conceive. You know the qualities and the cau&s;es of all that you behold, the laws by which the river flows, the periods in which the planets perform their revolutions. Every thing mu&s;t &s;upply you with contemplation, and renew the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own dignity."</P>
<P>"Lady an&s;wered he, let the gay and the vigorous expect plea&s;ure in their excur&s;ions, it is enough that age can obtain ea&s;e. To me the world has lo&s;t its novelty: I look round, and &s;ee what I remember to have &s;een in happier days. I re&s;t again&s;t a tree, and con&s;ider, that in the &s;ame &s;hade, I once di&s;puted upon the annual overflow of the Nile, with a friend who is now &s;ilent in the grave. I ca&s;t my eyes upwards, fix them on the changing moon, and think with pain on the vici&s;&s;itudes of life. I have cea&s;ed to take much delight in phy&s;ical truth; for what have I to do with tho&s;e things which I am &s;oon to leave?"</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="010939_0166_0F8529AE427326C8">
"You may at lea&s;t recreate your&s;elf, &s;aid Imlac, with the recollection of an honourable and u&s;eful life, and enjoy the prai&s;e which all agree to give you."</P>
<P>"Prai&s;e, &s;aid the &s;age with a &s;igh, is to an old man an empty &s;ound. I have neither mo|ther to be delighted with the reputation of her &s;on, nor wife to partake the honours of her hu&s;band. I have outlived my friends and my rivals. Nothing is now of much importance; for I cannot extend my intere&s;t beyond my|&s;elf. Youth is delighted with applau&s;e, becau&s;e it is con&s;idered as the earne&s;t of &s;ome future good, and becau&s;e the pro&s;pect of life is far extended: But to me, who am now declining to decrepitude, there is little to be feared from the malevolence of men, and yet le&s;s to be hoped from their affection or e&s;teem. Some|thing they may yet take away, but they can give me nothing. Riches would now be u&s;ele&s;s, and high employment would be pain. My retro&s;pect of life recalls to my view many op|portunities of good neglected, much time &s;quandered upon trifles, and more lo&s;t in idle|ne&s;s and vacancy. I leave many great de&s;igns unattempted, and many great attempts un|fini&s;hed. My mind is burthened with no hea|vy crime, and therefore I compo&s;e my&s;elf to tranquillity; endeavour to ab&s;tract my thoughts from hopes and cares, which, though
<PB N="167" REF="010939_0167_0F8529AE5B7B6298">
rea&s;on knows them to be vain, &s;till try to keep their old po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart; expect, with &s;erene humility, that hour which nature can|not long delay; and hope to po&s;&s;e&s;s in a bet|ter &s;tate that happine&s;s which here I could not find, and that virtue which here I have not attained."</P>
<P>He ro&s;e and went away, leaving his au|dience not much elated with the hope of long life. The prince con&s;oled him&s;elf with re|marking, that it was not rea&s;onable to be di&s;|appointed by this account; for age had never been con&s;idered as the &s;ea&s;on of felicity, and, if it was po&s;&s;ible to be ea&s;y in decline and weakne&s;s, it was likely that the days of vigour and alacrity might be happy; that the noon of life might be bright, if the evening could be calm.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s &s;u&s;pected that age was que|rulous and maligant, and delighted to repre&s;s the expectations of tho&s;e who had newly entered the world. She had &s;een the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of e&s;tates look with envy on their heirs, and known many who enjoy plea&s;ure no longer than they can confine it to them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Pekuah conjectured, that the man was older than he appeared, and was willing to

impute his complaints to delirious dejection; or el&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed that he had been unfortunate, and was therefore di&s;contented: "For no|thing, &s;aid &s;he, is more common than to call our own condition, the condition of life.</P>
<P>Imlac, who had no de&s;ire to &s;ee them depre&s;&s;ed, &s;miled at the comforts which they could &s;o readily procure to them&s;elves, and remembered, that at the &s;ame a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, he was equally confident of unmingled pro&s;perity, and equally fertile of con&s;olatory expedients. He forbore to force upon them unwelcome know|ledge, which time it&s;elf would too &s;oon im|pre&s;s.

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI. The prince&s;s and Pekuah vi&s;it the a&s;tronomer.</HEAD>
<P>THE prince&s;s and Pekuah having talked in private of Imlac's a&s;tronomer, thought his character at once &s;o amiable and &s;o &s;trange, that they could not be &s;atisfied without a nearer knowledge, and Imlac was reque&s;ted to find the means of bringing them together.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="010939_0169_0F8529AFD8D4E730">
This was &s;omewhat difficult; the philo&s;opher had never received any vi&s;its from women, though he lived in a city that had in it many Europeans, who followed the manners of their own countries, and many from other parts of the world that lived their with European liberty. The ladies would not be refu&s;ed, and &s;everal &s;chemes were propo&s;ed for the accompli&s;hment of their de&s;ign. It was propo&s;ed to introduce them as &s;trangers in di&s;tre&s;s, to whom the &s;age was always acce&s;&s;ible; but, after &s;ome deliberation, it appeared, that by this artifice, no acquaintance could be formed, for their conver&s;ation would be &s;hort, and they could not decently importune him often. "This, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, is true; but I have yet a &s;tronger objection again&s;t the mi&s;repre&s;entation of your &s;tate. I have always con&s;idered it as trea&s;on again&s;t the great republick of human nature, to make any man's virtues the means of deceiving him, whether on great or little oc|ca&s;ions. All impo&s;ture weakens confidence and chills benevolence. When the &s;age finds that you are not what you &s;eemed, he will feel the re&s;entment natural to a man who, con&s;cious of great abilities, di&s;covers that he has been tricked by under&s;tandings meaner than his own, and, perhaps, the di&s;tru&s;t, which he can never afterwards wholly lay a&s;ide, may &s;top the voice of coun&s;el, and clo&s;e the hand of charity; and where will you find the power
<PB N="170" REF="010939_0170_0F8529B099596528">
of re&s;toring his benefactions to mankind, or his peace to him&s;elf?"</P>
<P>To this no reply was attempted, and Imlac began to hope that their curio&s;ity would &s;ub|&s;ide; but, next day, Pekuah told him, &s;he had now found an hone&s;t pretence for a vi&s;it to the a&s;tronomer, for &s;he would &s;olicite permi&s;&s;ion to continue under him the &s;tudies in which &s;he had been initiated by the Arab, and the prince&s;s might go with her either as a fellow-&s;tudent, or becau&s;e a woman could not de|cently come alone. "I am afraid, &s;aid Imlac, that he will be &s;oon weary of your company: men advanced far in knowledge do not love to repeat the elements of their art, and I am not certain, that even of the elements, as he will deliver them connected with inferences, and mingled with reflections, you are a very capable auditre&s;s." "That, &s;aid Pekuah, mu&s;t be my care: I a&s;k of you only to take me thither. My knowledge is, perhaps, more than you imagine it, and by concurring al|ways with his opinions I &s;hall make him think it greater than it is."</P>
<P>The a&s;tronomer, in pur&s;uance of this re&s;o|lution, was told, that a foreign lady travelling in &s;earch of knowledge, had heard of his repu|tation, and was de&s;irous to become his &s;cholar. The uncommonne&s;s of the propo&s;al rai&s;ed at once his &s;urpri&s;e and curio&s;ity, and when, after
<PB N="171" REF="010939_0171_0F8529B15B1CF6B8">
a &s;hort deliberation, he con&s;ented to admit her, he could not &s;tay without impatience till the next day.</P>
<P>The ladies dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves magnificently, and were attended by Imlac to the a&s;tronomer, who was plea&s;ed to &s;ee him&s;elf approached with re&s;pect by per&s;ons of &s;o &s;plendid an appearance&punc; in the exchange of the fir&s;t civilities he was timorous and ba&s;hful; but, when the talk be|came regular, he recollected his powers, and ju&s;tified the character which Imlac had given. Enquiring of Pekuah what could have turned her inclination towards a&s;tronomy, he received from her a hi&s;tory of her adventure at the py|ramid, and of the time pa&s;&s;ed in the Arab's I&s;land. She told her tale with ea&s;e and elegance, and her conver&s;ation took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart. The di&s;cour&s;e was then turned to a&s;tronomy: Pekuah di&s;played what &s;he knew: he looked upon her as a prodigy of genius, and entreated her not to de&s;i&s;t from a &s;tudy which &s;he had &s;o happily begun.</P>
<P>They came again and again, and were every time more welcome than before. The &s;age endeavoured to amu&s;e them, that they might prolong their vi&s;its, for he found his thoughts grow brighter in their company; the clouds of &s;olicitude vani&s;hed by degrees, as he forced him&s;elf to entertain them, and he grieved
<PB N="172" REF="010939_0172_0F8529B282E3DE40">
when he was left at their departure to his old employment of regulating the &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s and her favourite had now watched his lips for &s;everal months, and could not catch a &s;ingle word from which they could judge whether he continued, or not, in the opinion of his preternatural commi&s;&s;ion. They often contrived to bring him to an open decla|ration, but he ea&s;ily eluded all their attacks, and on which &s;ide &s;oever they pre&s;&s;ed him e&s;caped from them to &s;ome other topick.</P>
<P>As their familiarity increa&s;ed, they invited him often to the hou&s;e of Imlac, where they di&s;tingui&s;hed him by extraordinary re&s;pect. He began gradually to delight in &s;ublunary plea&s;ures. He came early and departed late; laboured to recommend him&s;elf by a&s;&s;iduity and compliance; excited their curio&s;ity af|ter new arts, that they might &s;till want his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and when they made any excur&s;ion of plea&s;ure or enquiry, entreated to attend them.</P>
<P>By long experience of his integrity and wi&s;|dom, the prince and his &s;i&s;ter were convinced that he might be tru&s;ted without danger; and, le&s;t he &s;hould draw any fal&s;e hopes from the civilities which he received, di&s;covered to him their condition, with the motives of their

<P>"Of the various conditions which the world &s;preads before you, which you &s;hall prefer, &s;aid the &s;age, I am not able to in&s;truct you. I can only tell that I have cho&s;en wrong. I have pa&s;&s;ed my time in &s;tudy without experi|ence; in the attainments of &s;ciences which can, for the mo&s;t part, be but remotely u&s;eful to mankind. I have purcha&s;ed knowledge at the expence of all the common comforts of life: I have mi&s;&s;ed the endearing elegance of female friend&s;hip, and the happy commerce of dome&s;tick tenderne&s;s. If I have obtained any prerogatives above other &s;tudents, they have been accompanied with fear, di&s;quiet, and &s;crupulo&s;ity; but even of the&s;e prerogatives, whatever they were, I have, &s;ince my thoughts have been diver&s;ified by more intercour&s;e with the world begun to que&s;tion the reality. When I have been for a few days lo&s;t in plea&s;ing di&s;&s;ipation, I am always tempted to think that my enquiries have ended in error, and that I have &s;uffered much, and &s;uffered it in vain.</P>
<P>Imlac was delighted to find that the &s;age's under&s;tanding was breaking through its mi&s;ts, and re&s;olved to detain him from the planets till he &s;hould forget his ta&s;k of ruling them, and rea&s;on &s;hould recover its original influence.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="010939_0174_0F8529B3B7A018D8">
From this time the a&s;tronomer was received into familiar friend&s;hip, and partook of all their projects and plea&s;ures: his re&s;pect kept him attentive and the activity of Ra&s;&s;elas did not leave much time unengaged. Something was always to be done; the day was &s;pent in making ob&s;ervations which furni&s;hed talk for the evening, and the evening was clo&s;ed with a &s;cheme for the morrow.</P>
<P>The &s;age confe&s;&s;ed to Imlac, that &s;ince he had mingled in the gay tumults of life, and divided his hours by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of amu&s;e|ments, he found the conviction of his authority over the &s;kies fade gradually from his mind, and began to tru&s;t le&s;s to an opinion which he never could prove to others, and which he now found &s;ubject to variation from cau&s;es in which rea&s;on had no part. "If I am acciden|tally left alone for a few hours, &s;aid he, my inveterate per&s;ua&s;ion ru&s;hes upon my &s;oul, and my thoughts are chained down by &s;ome irre&s;i&s;tible violence, but they are &s;oon di&s;en|tangled by the prince's conver&s;ation, and in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly relea&s;ed at the entrance of Pe|kuah. I am like a man habitually afraid of &s;pectres, who is &s;et at ea&s;e by a lamp, and wonders at the dread which harra&s;&s;ed him in the dark; yet, if his lamp be extingui&s;hed, feels again the terrors which he knows that when it is light he &s;hall feel no more. But I
<PB N="175" REF="010939_0175_0F8529B4561C3B88">
am &s;ometimes afraid le&s;t I indulge my quiet by criminal negligence, and voluntarily forget the great charge with which I am intru&s;ted. If I favour my&s;elf in a known error, or am determined by my own ea&s;e in a doubtful que&s;tion of this importance, how dreadful is my crime!"</P>
<P>"No di&s;ea&s;e of the imagination, an&s;wered Imlac, is &s;o difficult of cure, as that which is complicated with the dread of guilt: fancy and con&s;cience then act interchangeably upon us, and &s;o often &s;hift their places, that the illu&s;ions of one are not di&s;tingui&s;hed from the dictates of the other. If fancy pre&s;ents images not moral or religious, the mind drives them away when they give it pain, but when me|lancholick notions take the form of duty, they lay hold on the faculties without oppo&s;iti|on, becau&s;e we are afraid to exclude or bani&s;h them. For this rea&s;on the &s;uper&s;titious are often melancholy, and the melancholy almo&s;t always &s;uper&s;titious.</P>
<P>"But do not let the &s;ugge&s;tions of timidity overpower your better rea&s;on: the danger of neglect can be but as the probability of the obligation, which when you con&s;ider it with freedom, you find very little, and that little growing every day le&s;s. Open your heart to the influence of the light, which, from time

to time, breaks in upon you: when &s;cru|ples importune you, which you in your lucid moments know to be vain, do not &s;tand to parley, but fly to bu&s;ine&s;s or to Pe|kuah, and keep this thought always prevalent, that you are only one atom of the ma&s;s of hu|manity, and have neither &s;uch virtue nor vice, as that you &s;hould be &s;ingled out for &s;uperna|tural favours or&punc; afflictions."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. The prince enters and brings a new topick.</HEAD>
<P>"ALL this &s;aid the a&s;tronomer, I have often thought, but my rea&s;on has been &s;o long &s;ubjugated by an uncontroulable and overwhelming idea, that it dur&s;t not con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters"> its own deci&s;ions. I now &s;ee how fa|tally I betrayed my quiet, by &s;uffering chime|ras to prey upon me in &s;ecret; but melancholy &s;krinks from communication, and I never found a man before, to whom I could impart my troubles, though I had been certain of relief. I rejoice to find my own &s;entiments confirmed by yours, who are not ea&s;ily deceived, and can have no motive or purpo&s;e to deceive. I hope that time and variety will di&s;&s;ipate the gloom that has &s;o long &s;urrounded me, and the lat|ter part of my days will be &s;pent in peace."</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="010939_0177_0F8529B84050AC58">
"Your learning and virtue, &s;aid Imlac, may ju&s;tly give you hopes."</P>
<P>Ra&s;&s;elas then entered with the prince&s;s and Pekuah, and enquired whether they had con|trived any new diver&s;ion for the next day. "Such, &s;aid Nekayah, is the &s;tate of life, that none are happy but by the anticipation of change: the change it&s;elf is nothing; when we have made it, the next wi&s;h is to change again. The world is not yet exhau&s;ted; let me &s;ee &s;omething to-morrow which I never &s;aw before.</P>
<P>"Variety, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to content, that even the happy valley di&s;gu&s;ted me by the recurrence of its luxuries; yet I could not forbear to reproach my&s;elf with im|patience, when I &s;aw the monks of St. An|thony &s;upport without complaint, a life, not of uniform delight, but uniform hard&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e men, an&s;wered Imlac, are le&s;s wretched in their &s;ilent convent than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Abi&s;|&s;inian princes in their pri&s;on of plea&s;ure. What|ever is done by the monks is incited by an adequate and rea&s;onable motive. Their la|bour &s;upplies them with nece&s;&s;aries; it there|fore cannot be omitted, and is certainly re|warded. Their devotion prepares them for another &s;tate, and reminds them of its ap|proach,
<PB N="178" REF="010939_0178_0F8529B8E515AAE8">
while it fits them for it. Their time is regularly di&s;tributed; one duty &s;ucceds ano|ther, &s;o that they are not left open to the di&s;|traction of unguided choice, nor lo&s;t in the &s;hades of li&s;tle&s;s inactivity. There is a certain ta&s;k to be performed at an appropriated hour; and their toils are chearful, becau&s;e they con&s;i|der them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as acts of piety, by which they are always advancing towards endle&s;s felicity."</P>
<P>"Do you think, &s;aid Nekayah, that the mona&s;tick rule is a more holy and le&s;s imperfect &s;tate than any other? May not he equally hope for future happine&s;s who conver&s;es openly with mankind, who &s;uccours the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by his charity, in&s;tructs the ignorant by his learning, and contributes by his indu&s;try to the general &s;y&s;tem of life; even though he &s;hould omit &s;ome of the mortifications which are practi&s;ed in the cloi&s;ter, and allow him&s;elf &s;uch harm|le&s;s delights as his condition may place within his reach?"</P>
<P>"This, &s;aid Imlac, is a que&s;tion which has long divided the wi&s;e, and perplexed the good. I am afraid to decide on either part. He that lives well in the world, is better than he that lives well in a mona&s;tery. But, perhaps, every one is not able to &s;tem the temptations of publick life; and, if he cannot conquer, he may properly retreat. Some have little
<PB N="179" REF="010939_0179_0F8529B9A46A1138">
power to do good, and have likewi&s;e little &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t evil. Many are weary of their conflicts with adver&s;ity, and are willing to eject tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which have long bu&s;ied them in vain. And many are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by age and di&s;ea&s;es from the more laborious duties of &s;ociety. In mona&s;teries the weak and timor|ous may be happily &s;heltered, the weary may repo&s;e, and the penitent may meditate. Tho&s;e retreats of prayer and contemplation have &s;omething &s;o congenial to the mind of man, that, perhaps, there is &s;carcely one that does not purpo&s;e to clo&s;e his life in pious ab&s;traction with a few a&s;&s;ociates &s;erious as him&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Such, &s;aid Pekuah, has often been my wi&s;h, and I have heard the prince&s;s declare, that &s;he would not willingly die in a croud."</P>
<P>"The liberty of u&s;ing harmle&s;s plea&s;ures, proceeded Imlac, will not be di&s;puted; but it is &s;till to be examined what plea&s;ures are harm|le&s;s. The evil of any plea&s;ure that Nekayah can image is not in the act it&s;elf, but in its con&s;equences. Plea&s;ure, in it&s;elf harmle&s;s, may become mi&s;chievous, by endearing to us a &s;tate which we know to be tran&s;ient and pro|batory, and withdrawing our thoughts from that, of which every hour brings us nearer to the beginning, and of which no length of time will bring us to the end. Mortification is not vir|tuous
<PB N="180" REF="010939_0180_0F8529BA5D6730F0">
in it&s;elf, nor has any other u&s;e, but that it di&s;engages us from the allurements of &s;en&s;e. In the &s;tate of future perfection, to which we all a&s;pire, there will be plea&s;ure without dan|ger, and &s;ecurity without re&s;traint."</P>
<P>The prince&s;s was &s;ilent, and Ra&s;&s;elas, turn|ing to the a&s;tronomer, a&s;ked him, whether he could not delay her retreat, by &s;hewing her &s;omething which &s;he had not &s;een before.</P>
<P>"Your curio&s;ity, &s;aid the &s;age, has been &s;o general, and your pur&s;uit of knowledge &s;o vi|gorous, that novelties are not now very ea&s;ily to be found: but what you can no longer pro|cure from the living may be given by the dead. Among the wonders of this country are the catacombs, or the ancient repo&s;itories, in which the bodies of the earlie&s;t generations were lodged, and where, by the virtue of the gums which embalmed them, they yet remain without corruption.</P>
<P>"I know not, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, what plea&s;ure the &s;ight of the catacombs can afford; but, &s;ince nothing el&s;e is offered, I am re&s;olved to view them, and &s;hall place this with many other things which I have done, becau&s;e I would do &s;omething."</P>
<P>They hired a guard of hor&s;emen, and the

next day vi&s;ited the catacombs. When they were about to de&s;cend into the &s;upulchral caves, "Pekuah, &s;aid the prince&s;s, we are now again invading the habitations of the dead; I know that you will &s;tay behind; let me find you &s;afe when I return." No, I will not be left, an|&s;wered Pekuah; I will go down between you and the prince."</P>
<P>They then all de&s;cended, and roved with wonder through the labyrinth of &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, where the bodies were laid in rows on either &s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVIII. Imlac di&s;cour&s;es on the nature of the &s;oul.</HEAD>
<P>"WHAT rea&s;on, &s;aid the prince, can be given, why the Egyptians &s;hould thus expen&s;ively pre&s;erve tho&s;e carca&s;&s;es which &s;ome nations con&s;ume with fire, others lay to mingle with the earth, and all agree to remove from their &s;ight as &s;oon as decent rites can be performed?</P>
<P>"The original of ancient cu&s;toms, &s;aid Imlac, is commonly unknown; for the prac|tice often continues when the cau&s;e has cea&s;ed; and concerning &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies it is vain to conjecture; for what rea&s;on did not dictate rea&s;on cannot explain. I have long
<PB N="182" REF="010939_0182_0F8529BC7067AD88">
believed that the practice of embalming, aro&s;e only from tenderne&s;s to the remains of rela|tions or friends, and to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s opinion I am more inclined, becau&s;e it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that this care &s;hould have been general: had all the dead been embalmed, their repo&s;itories mu&s;t in time have been more &s;pacious than the dwellings of the living. I &s;uppo&s;e only the rich or honourable were &s;ecured from corrup|tion, and the re&s;t left to the cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>"But it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed that the Egyptians believed the &s;oul to live as long as the body continued undi&s;&s;olved, and there|fore tried this method of eluding death."</P>
<P>"Could the wi&s;e Egyptians, &s;aid Nekayah, think &s;o gro&s;ly of the &s;oul? If the &s;oul could once &s;urvive its &s;eparation, what could it after|wards receive or &s;uffer from the body?</P>
<P>"The Egyptians would doubtle&s;s think er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oneou&s;ly, &s;aid the a&s;tronomer, in the dark|ne&s;s of heatheni&s;m, and the fir&s;t dawn of philo&s;ophy. The nature of the &s;oul is &s;till di&s;puted amid&s;t all our opportunities of clearer knowledge: &s;ome yet &s;ay, that it may be material who neverthele&s;s, believe it to be immortal."</P>
<P>"Some, an&s;wered Imlac, have indeed &s;aid
<PB N="183" REF="010939_0183_0F8529BD14BDE408">
that the &s;oul is material, but I can &s;carcely believe that any man has thought it, who knew how to think; for all the conclu&s;ions of rea&s;on enforce the immateriality of the mind, and all the notices of &s;en&s;e and inve&s;tigations of &s;cience concur to prove the uncon&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of matter.</P>
<P>"It was never &s;uppo&s;ed that cogitation is inherent in matter, or that every particle is a thinking being. Yet, if any part of matter be devoid of thought, what part can we &s;up|po&s;e to think? Matter can differ from matter only in form, den&s;ity, bulk, motion, and direction of motion: to which of the&s;e, however varied or combined, can con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s be annex|ed? to be round or &s;quare, to be &s;olid or fluid, to be great o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> little, to be moved &s;lowly or &s;wiftly one way or another, are modes of material exi&s;tence, all equally alien from the nature of cogitation. If matter be once without thought, it can only be made to think by &s;ome new modification, but all the modifications which it can admit are equally unconnected wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h cogitative p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wers."</P>
<P>"But the materiali&s;ts, &s;aid the a&s;tronomer, urge that matter may have qualities with which we are unacquainted."</P>
<P>"He who will determine, returned Imlac, again&s;t that which he knows, becau&s;e there
<PB N="184" REF="010939_0184_0F8529BDEEC914D0">
may be &s;omething which he knows not; he that can &s;et hypothetical po&s;&s;ibility again&s;t acknowledged certainty, is not to be admit|ted among rea&s;onable beings. All that we know of matter is, that matter is inert, &s;en&s;e|le&s;s and lifele&s;s; and if this conviction cannot be oppo&s;ed but by referring us to &s;omething that we know not, we have all the evidence that human intellect can admit. If that which is known may be over-ruled by that which is unknown, no being, not omni&s;cient, can ar|rive at certainty."</P>
<P>"Yet let us not, &s;aid the a&s;tronomer, too arrogantly limit the Creators power."</P>
<P>"It is no limitation of omnipotence, replied the poet; to &s;uppo&s;e that one thing is not con&s;i&s;tent with another, that the &s;ame propo|&s;ition cannot be at once true and fal&s;e, that the &s;ame number cannot be even and odd, that cogitation cannot be conferred on that which is created incapable of cogitation."</P>
<P>"I know not, &s;aid Nekayah, any great u&s;e of this que&s;tion. Does that immateriality, which, in my opinion, you have &s;ufficiently proved, nece&s;&s;arily include eternal duration?"</P>
<P>"Of immateriality, &s;aid Imlac, our ideas are negative, and therefore ob&s;cure. Imma|teriality,
<PB N="185" REF="010939_0185_0F8529BE25A271F8">
&s;eems to imply a natural power of perpetual duration as a con&s;equence of exempti|on from all cau&s;es of decay: whatever peri&s;hes, is de&s;troyed by the &s;olution of its contexture, and &s;eparation of its parts; nor can we con|ceive how that which has no parts, and there|fore admits no &s;olution, can be naturally cor|rupted or impaired."</P>
<P>"I know not &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, how to conceive any thing without exten&s;ion: what is extended mu&s;t have parts, and you allow, that what|ever has parts may be de&s;troyed."</P>
<P>"Con&s;ider your own conceptions, replied Imlac, and the difficulty will be le&s;s. You will find &s;ub&s;tance without exten&s;ion. An ideal form is no le&s;s real than material bulk: yet, an ideal form has no exten&s;ion. It is no le&s;s certain, when you think on a pyramid that your mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the idea of a pyramid, than that the pyramid it&s;elf is &s;tanding. What &s;pace does the idea of a pyramid occupy, more than the idea of a grain of corn? or how can either idea &s;uffer laceration? As is the effect &s;uch is the cau&s;e: as the thought is, &s;uch is the power that thinks; a power impa&s;&s;ive and indi&s;cerpible.</P>
<P>"But the Being &s;aid Nekayah, whom I fear to name, the Being which made the &s;oul, can de&s;troy it."</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="010939_0186_0F8529C26E8414C0">
"He, &s;urely can de&s;toy it, an&s;wered, Imlac, &s;ince, however unperi&s;hable in it&s;elf, it re|ceives from a higher nature its power of duration. That it will not peri&s;h by any in|herent cau&s;e or trouble or corruption, may be collected from philo&s;ophy; but philo|&s;ophy can tell no more. That it will not be annihilated by him that made it, we mu&s;t humbly learn from higher authority."</P>
<P>The whole a&s;&s;embly &s;tood a while &s;ilent and collected. "Let us return, &s;aid Ra&s;&s;elas, from this &s;cene of mortality. How gloomy would be the&s;e man&s;ions of the dead to him who did not know that he &s;hould never die; that what now acts &s;hall continue its agency, and what now thinks &s;hall think on for ever. Tho&s;e that lie here &s;tretched before us, the wi&s;e and the powerful of ancient times, warn us to re|member the &s;hortne&s;s of our pre&s;ent &s;tate: they were, perhaps, &s;natched away while they were bu&s;y, like us, in the choice of life."</P>
<P>"To me &s;aid the prince&s;s, the choice of life is become le&s;s important; I hope hereafter to think only on the choice of eternity."</P>

<P>IT was now the time of the inundation of the Nile: a few days after their vi&s;it to the catacombs, the river began to ri&s;e.</P>
<P>They were confined to their hou&s;e. The whole region being under water gave them no invitation to any excur&s;ions, and, being well &s;upplied with materials for talk, they diverted them&s;elves with compari&s;ons of the different forms of life which they had ob&s;erved, and with various &s;chemes of happine&s;s which each of them had formed.</P>
<P>Pekuah was never &s;o much charmed with any place as the convent of St. Anthony, where the Arab re&s;tored her to the prince&s;s, and wi&s;hed only to fill it with pious maidens, and to be made priore&s;s of the order: &s;he was weary of expectation and di&s;gu&s;t, and would gladly be fixed in &s;ome unvariable &s;tate.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s thought, that of all &s;ublunary things, knowledge was the be&s;t: She de&s;ired fir&s;t to learn all &s;ciences, and then purpo&s;ed to found a college of learned women, in which

&s;he would pre&s;ide, that, by conver&s;ing with the old, and educating the young, &s;he might divide her time between the acqui&s;ition and communication of wi&s;dom, and rai&s;e up for the next age models of prudence, and patterns of piety.</P>
<P>The prince de&s;ired a little kingdom, in which he might admini&s;ter ju&s;tice in his own per&s;on, and &s;ee all the parts of government with his own eyes; but he could never fix the limits of his dominion, and was always adding to the number of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Imlac and the a&s;tronomer were contented to be driven along the &s;tream of life, without directing their cour&s;e to any particular port.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e wi&s;hes that they formed they well knew that none could be obtained. They deliberated a while what was to be done, and re&s;olved, when the inundation &s;hould cea&s;e, to return to the land of in Abi&s;&s;inia.</P>

<P>"LIFE," &s;ays <HI>Seneca,</HI> <Q>is a voyage, in the progre&s;s of which, we are perpetually changing our &s;cenes; we fir&s;t leave child|hood behind us, then youth, then the years of ripened manhood, then the more plea&s;ing part of old age.</Q> The peru&s;al of this pa&s;|&s;age, having excited in me a train of reflections on the &s;tate of man, the ince&s;&s;ant fluctuation of his wi&s;hes, the gradual change of his di&s;|po&s;ition to all external objects, and the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s with which he floats along the &s;tream of time, I &s;unk into a &s;lumber amid&s;t my me|ditations, and, on a &s;udden, found my ears filled with the tumult of labour, the &s;houts of alacrity, the &s;hrieks of alarm, the whi&s;tle of winds, and the da&s;h of waters.</P>
<P>MY a&s;toni&s;hment for a time repre&s;&s;ed my curio&s;ity; but &s;oon reco|vering my&s;elf &s;o far as to enquire whither we were going, and what was the cau&s;e of &s;uch clamour and confu&s;ion, I was told that we were launching out into the <HI>ocean of life;</HI> that we had already pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treights of infancy, in which multitudes had peri&s;hed, &s;ome by the weakne&s;s and fragility of their ve&s;&s;els, and more by the folly, per|ver&s;ene&s;s, or negligence of tho&s;e who undertook to &s;teer them; and

<P>I THEN looked round <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ith anxious eagerne&s;s; and fir&s;t turning my eyes behind me, &s;aw a &s;tream flowing through flowery I&s;lands, which every one that failed along &s;eemed to behold with plea&s;ure; but no &s;ooner touched, than the current, which, though not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or turbulent, was yet irre&s;i&s;tible, bore him away. Beyond the&s;e i&s;lands all was darkne&s;s, nor could any of the pa&s;&s;engers de&s;cribe the &s;hore at which he fir&s;t embarked.</P>
<P>BEFORE me, and on each &s;ide, was an expan&s;e of waters vio|lently agitated, and covered with &s;o thick a rai&s;t, that the mo&s;t per|&s;picacious eye could &s;ee but a little way. It appeared to be full of rocks and whirlpools, for many &s;unk unexpectedly while they were courting the gale with full &s;ails, and in&s;ulting tho&s;e whom they had left behind. So numerous, indeed, were the dangers, and &s;o thick the darkne&s;s, that no caution could confer &s;ecurity. Yet there were many, who, by fal&s;e intelligence, betrayed their followers into whirlpools, or by violence pu&s;hed tho&s;e whom they found in their way again&s;t the rocks.</P>
<P>THE current was invariable and in&s;urmountable; but though it was impo&s;&s;ible to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail again&s;t it, or to return to the place that was once pa&s;&s;ed, yet it was not &s;o violent as to allow no opportunities for dexterity on courage, &s;ince, though none could retreat back from danger, yet they might often avoid it by oblique direction.</P>
<P>IT was, however, not very common to &s;teer with much care or prudence; for; by &s;ome univer&s;al infatuation, every man appeared to think him&s;elf &s;afe, though he &s;aw his con&s;orts every moment &s;inking round him; and no &s;ooner had the waves clo&s;ed over them, than their fate and their mi&s;conduct were forgotten; the voyage was pur|&s;ued with the &s;ame jocund confidence; every man congratulated him|&s;elf upon the &s;oundne&s;s of his ve&s;&s;el, and believed him&s;elf able to &s;tem the whirlpool in which his friend was &s;wallowed, or glide over the rock on which he was da&s;hed: nor was it often ob&s;erved that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of a wreck made any man change his cour&s;e; if he turned a&s;ide for a moment, he &s;oon forgot the rudder, and left him&s;elf again to the di&s;po&s;al of chance.</P>
<P>THIS negligence did not proceed from indifference, or from wea|rine&s;s of their pre&s;ent condition; for not one of tho&s;e, who thus ru&s;hed upon de&s;truction, failed, when he was &s;inking, to call loudly upon his a&s;&s;ociates for that help which could not now be given him; and many &s;pent their la&s;t moments in cautioning others again&s;t the

folly, by which they were intercepted in the mid&s;t of their cour&s;e. Their benevolence was &s;ometimes prai&s;ed, but their admonitions were unreg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rded.</P>
<P>THE ve&s;&s;els, in which we had embarked, being confe&s;&s;edly une|qual to to the turbulence of the &s;tream of life, were vi&s;ibly impaired in the cour&s;e of the voyage; &s;o that every pa&s;&s;enger was certain, that how long &s;oever he might, by favourable accidents, or by ince&s;&s;ant vigilance, be pre&s;erved, he mu&s;t &s;ink at la&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS nece&s;&s;ity of peri&s;hing might have been expected to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dden the gay, and intimidate the daring, at lea&s;t to keep the melancholy and timorous in perpetual torments, and hinder them from any enjoy|ment of the varieties and gratifications which nature offered them as the &s;olace of their labours; yet in effect none &s;eemed le&s;s to expect de&s;truction than tho&s;e to whom it was mo&s;t dreadful; they all had the art of concealing their danger from them&s;elves; and tho&s;e who knew their inability to bear the &s;ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the terrors that embarra&s;&s;ed their way, took care never to look forward, but found &s;ome amu&s;e|ment for the pre&s;ent moment, and generally entertained them&s;elves by playing with HOPE, who was the con&s;tant a&s;&s;ociate of the voyage of life.</P>
<P>YET all that HOPE ventured to promi&s;e, even to tho&s;e whom &s;he favoured mo&s;t, was, not that they &s;hould e&s;cape, but that they &s;hould &s;ink among the la&s;t; and with this promi&s;e every one was &s;atisfied, though he laughed at the re&s;t or &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eming to believe it. HOPE, indeed, apparently mocked the credulity of her companions, for, inproportion as their ve&s;&s;els grew leaky, &s;he redoubled her a&s;&s;urances of &s;afety; and none were more bu&s;y in making provi&s;ion for a long voyage, than they, whom all but them&s;elves &s;aw likely to peri&s;h &s;oon by irreparable decay.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of the current of life was the <HI>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ph of</HI> INTEMPE|RANCE, a dreadful whirlpool, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;per&s;ed with rocks, of which the pointed crags were concealed under water, and the tops covered with herbage, on which EASE &s;pread couches of repo&s;e, and with &s;hades, where PLEASURE warbled the &s;ong of invitation. Within &s;ight of the&s;e rocks all who &s;ailed on the ocean of life mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily pa&s;s. REASON, indeed; was always at hand to &s;teer the pa&s;&s;en|gers through a narrow outlet by which they might e&s;cape; but very few could, by her entreaties or remon&s;trances, be induced to put the rudder into her hand, without &s;tipulating that &s;he &s;hould approach &s;o near unto the rocks of PL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ASURE, that they might &s;olace them|&s;elves with a &s;hort enjoyment of that delicious region, after which they always determined to pur&s;ue their cour&s;e without any other deviation.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="010939_0192_0F8529C7F31D9DF8">
REASON was too often prevailed upon &s;o far by the&s;e promi&s;es, as to venture her charge within the eddy of the gulph of INTEM|PERANCE, where, indeed, the circumvolution was weak, but yet interrupted the cour&s;e of the ve&s;&s;el, and drew it by in&s;en&s;ible rotations, towards the centre. She then repented her temerity, and with all her force endeavoured to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">treat; but the draught of the gulph was generally too &s;trong to be overcome; and the pa&s;&s;enger, having danced in circles with a plea&s;ing and giddy velocity, was at la&s;t overwhelmed and lo&s;t. Tho&s;e &s;ew whom REASON was able to extricate, generally &s;uffered &s;o many &s;hocks upon the points which &s;hot out from the rocks of PLEASURE,, that they were unable to continue their cour&s;e with the &s;ame &s;trength and facility as before, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> floated along timorou&s;ly and feeb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, endangered by every breeze, and &s;hattered by every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uffle of the water, till they &s;unk, by &s;low degrees, after long &s;truggles, and innumerable expedients, always repining at their own folly, and warning others again&s;t the fir&s;t-approach to the gulph of INTEMPERANCE.</P>
<P>THERE were arti&s;ts who profe&s;&s;ed to repair the breach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and &s;top the leaks of the ve&s;&s;els which had been &s;hattered on the rocks of PLEA|SURE. Many appeared to have great confidence in their skill, and &s;ome, indeed, were pre&s;erved by it from &s;inking, who had received only a &s;ingle blow; but I remarked&punc; that few ve&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s la&s;ted long which had been much repaired, nor was it found that the arti&s;ts them&s;elves continued afloat longer than tho&s;e who had lea&s;t of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE only advantage, which in the voyage of life, the cautious had above the negligent, was, that they &s;unk later, and more &s;uddenly; for they pa&s;&s;ed forward till they had &s;ometimes &s;een all tho&s;e in who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e company they had i&s;&s;ued from the &s;treights of infancy, peri&s;h in the way, and at la&s;t were over&s;et by a cro&s;s breeze, without the toil of re&s;i&s;tance, or the angui&s;h of expectation. But &s;uch as had often fallen again&s;t the rocks of PLEASURE, commonly &s;ub|&s;ided by &s;en&s;ible degrees, contended long with the encroaching waters, and hara&s;&s;ed them&s;elves by labours that &s;carce HOPE her&s;elf could flatter with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>AS I was looking upon the various fate of the multitude about me, I was &s;uddenly alarmed with an admonition from &s;ome unknown Power, <Q>Gaze not idly upon others when thou thy&s;elf art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inking. Whence is this thoughtle&s;s tranquillity, when thou and they are equally endangered?</Q> I looked, and &s;eeing the gulph of INTEM|PERANCE before me, &s;tarted and awaked.</P>
