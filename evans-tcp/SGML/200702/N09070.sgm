<HEAD>A &s;hort Narrative of the horrid Ma&s;&s;acre in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> perpetrated in the Evening of the
<DATE>Fifth Day of <HI>March,</HI> 1770,</DATE>
by Soldiers of the XXIX^t^h Re|giment; which with the XIV^t^h Regi|ment were then quartered there: with &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on the State of Things prior to that Cata&s;trophe.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be a proper introduction to this nar|rative, briefly to repre&s;ent the &s;tate of things for &s;ome time previous to the &s;aid ma&s;&s;acre: And this &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary in order to the forming a ju&s;t idea of the cau&s;es of it.</P>
<P>At the end of the late war, in which this Province bore &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a part, a happy union &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Great-Britain and the Colonies. This was unfortunately interrupted by the Stamp-Act: but it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored by the Repeal of it. It was again in|terrupted by other acts of parliament for taxing America; and by the appointment of a Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, in pur&s;uance of an act&punc; which by the face of it was made for the relief and encouragement of commerce, but which in it's operation, it was apprehended, would have, and it has in fact had, a contrary effect. By the &s;aid act the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners were "to be re&s;ident
<PB N="6" REF="011580_0006_0F8745A9999DE450">
in &s;ome convenient part of his Maje&s;ty's do|minions in America".&mdash;This mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be in &s;ome part convenient for the whole&mdash; But it does not appear, that in fixing the place of their re&s;idence, the convenience of the whole was at all con&s;ulted, for Bo&s;ton being very far from the centre of the colonies, could not be the place mo&s;t convenient for the whole.&mdash; Judging by the act, it may &s;eem this town was intended to be favoured, by the Commi&s;&s;ioners being appointed to re&s;ide here; and that the con&s;equence of that re&s;idence would be the re|lief and encouragement of commerce: but the rever&s;e has been the con&s;tant and uniform effect of it: So that the commerce of the town, from the embara&s;&s;ments in which it has been latety involved, is greatly reduced. For the particulars on this head, &s;ee the &s;tate of the trade not long &s;ince drawn up and tran&s;mitted to England by a committee of the merchants of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The re&s;idence of the Commi&s;&s;ioners here, has been detrimental not only to the commerce, but to the political intere&s;ts of the town and pro|vince; and not only &s;o, but we can trace from it the cau&s;es of the late horrid ma&s;&s;acre. Soon after their arrival here in November 1767, in|&s;tead of confining them&s;elves to the proper bu&s;i|ne&s;s of their office, they became partizans of Governor Bernard in his political &s;chemes; and had the weakne&s;s and temerity to infringe upon one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights of the hou&s;e of commons of this province&mdash;that of giving
<PB N="7" REF="011580_0007_0F8745A9A6694C38">
their votes with freedom, and not being accoun|table therefor but to their con&s;tituents. One of the members of that hou&s;e Capt. Timothy Folgier, having voted in &s;ome affair contrary to the mind of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners, was for &s;o doing di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the office he held under them.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings of theirs, the difficulty of acce&s;s to them on office-bu&s;ine&s;s, and a &s;uperci|lious behaviour, rendered them di&s;gu&s;tful to peo|ple in general, who in con&s;equence thereof treated them with neglect. This probably &s;ti|mulated them to re&s;ent it: and to make their re&s;entment felt, they and their coadjutor Gover|nor Bernard, made &s;uch repre&s;entations to his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters as they thought be&s;t calculated to bring the di&s;plea&s;ure of the nation upon the town and province: and in order that tho&s;e re|pre&s;entations might have the more weight, they are &s;aid to have contrived, and executed plans for exciting di&s;turbances and tumults, which otherwi&s;e would probably never have exi&s;ted; and when excited, to have tran&s;mitted to the mini&s;try the mo&s;t exaggerated accounts of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars of their conduct his Maje&s;ty's Council of this province have fully laid open in their proceeding in council, and in their addre&s;s to General Gage, in July and October 1768; and in their letter to Lord Hill&s;borough of the 15th of April 1769.&mdash;Unfortunately for us, they have been too &s;ucce&s;sful in their &s;aid repre|&s;entations, which in conjunction with Governor Bernard's, have occa&s;ioned his Maje&s;ty's faithful
<PB N="8" REF="011580_0008_0F8745AA659DDE18">
&s;ubjects of this town and province to be treated as enemies and rebels, by an inva&s;ion of the town by &s;ea and land: to which the approaches were made with all the circum&s;pection, u&s;ual where a vigorous oppo&s;ition is expected. While the town was &s;urrounded by a con&s;iderable number of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war, two regi|ments landed and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and to &s;upport the&s;e, two other regiments arrived &s;ome time after from Ireland: one of which landed at Ca&s;tle I&s;land, and the other the town.</P>
<P>Thus were we, in aggravation of our other embarra&s;&s;ments, embarra&s;&s;ed with troops, forced upon us contrary to our inclination &mdash;contrary to the &s;pirit of Magna Charta,&mdash; contrary to the very letter of the Bill of Rights, in which it is declared, that the rai&s;ing or keeping a &s;tanding army within the kingdom in time of peace, unle&s;s it be with the con&s;ent of parliament, is again&s;t law&mdash;and with|out the de&s;ire of the civil magi&s;trates, to aid whom was the pretence for &s;ending the troops hither: who were quartered in the town in direct violation of an act of parliament for quartering troops in America: and all this in con&s;equence of the repre&s;entations of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners and the &s;aid Governor, as appears by their me|morials and letters lately publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>As they were the procuring cau&s;e of troops being &s;ent hither, they mu&s;t therefore be the re|mote and a blameable cau&s;e of all the di&s;turban|ces and blood&s;hed that have taken place in con|&s;equence of that Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011580_0009_0F8745AB1EEBD908">But we &s;hall leave them to their own reflec|tions, after ob&s;erving, that as they had &s;ome months before the arrival of the troops, under pretence of &s;afety to their per&s;ons, retired from town to the Ca&s;tle, &s;o after the arrival of the troops, and their being quartered in the town, they thought proper to return: having an&s;wered, as they doubtle&s;s thought, the purpo&s;e of their voluntary flight.</P>
<P>We &s;hall next attend to the conduct of the troops, and to &s;ome circum&s;tances relative to them.&mdash;Governor Bernard without con&s;ulting the Council, having given up the State-hou&s;e to the troops at their landing, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the chambers, where the repre&s;entatives of the province and the courts of law held their meet|ings; and (except the council-chamber) of all other parts of that hou&s;e: in which they conti|nued a con&s;iderable time, to the great annoyance of tho&s;e courts while they &s;at, and of the mer|chants and gentlemen of the town, who had al|ways made the lower floor of it their exchange. They had a right &s;o to do, as the property of it was in the town: but they were deprived of that right by meer power.&mdash;The &s;aid Governor &s;oon after, by every &s;tratagem and by every me|thod, but a forcible entry, endeavored to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the manufactory-hou&s;e, to make a barrack of it for the troops: and for that pur|po&s;e cau&s;ed it to be be&s;ieged by the troops, and the people in it to be u&s;ed very cruelly; which extraordinary proceedings created univer&s;al un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="10" REF="011580_0010_0F8745ABDF05ECD0">
ari&s;ing from the apprehen&s;ion; that the troops under the influence of &s;uch a man would be employed to effect the mo&s;t dangerous pur|po&s;es: but failing of that other hou&s;es were pro|cured, in which, contrary to act of parliament, he cau&s;ed the troops to be quartered. After their quarters were &s;ettled, the main guard was po&s;ted at one of the &s;aid hou&s;es, directly oppo&s;ite to, and not twelve yards from, the State-hou&s;e, (where the General Court, and all the Law Courts for the County were held) with two field pieces pointed to the State-hou&s;e. This &s;ituation of the main guard and field pieces &s;eemed to indicate an attack upon the con&s;titu|tion, and a defiance of law; and to be intended to affront the legi&s;lative and executive authority of the province.</P>
<P>The General Court, at the fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ion after the arrival of the troops, viewed it in this light, and applied to Governor Bernard to cau&s;e &s;uch a nu&s;ance to be removed; but to no purpo&s;e. Di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;uch an indignity, and at the appear|ance of being under dure&s;&s;e, they refu&s;ed to do bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;uch circum&s;tances; and in con&s;e|quence thereof were adjourned to Cambridge, to the great inconvenience of the members.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the challenging the inhabitants by centinels po&s;ted in all parts of the town be|fore the lodgings of officers, which (for about &s;ix months, while it la&s;ted) occa&s;ioned many quarrels and great unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;</P>

Wil&s;on's, of the 59th, exciting the ne|groes of the town to take away their ma&s;ters lives and property, and repair to the army for protection, which was fully proved again&s;t him. &mdash;The attack of a party of &s;oldiers on &s;ome of the magi&s;trates of the town&mdash;the repeated re&s;|cues of &s;oldiers from peace officers&mdash;the firing of a loaded mu&s;ket in a public &s;treet, to the en|dangering a great number of peaceable inhabi|tants&mdash;the frequent wounding of per&s;ons by their bayonets and cutla&s;&s;as, and the numerous in&s;tances of bad behaviour in the &s;oldiery made us early &s;en&s;ible, that the troops were not &s;ent here for any benefit to the town or pro|vince, and that we had no good to expect from &s;uch con&s;ervators of the peace.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants, in&s;tead of making application to the military officers on the&s;e occa&s;ions, cho&s;e rather to oppo&s;e the civil au|thority and the laws of the land to &s;uch offenders; and had not the &s;oldiery found means to evade legal puni&s;hments, it is more than probable their in&s;olence would have received a check and &s;ome of the mo&s;t melancholy effects of it been prevented.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was not expected however, that &s;uch an outrage and ma&s;&s;acre, as happened here on the evening of the fifth in&s;tant, would have been perpetrated. There were then killed and wound|ed, by a di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry, eleven of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, viz.</P>
<P>Mr. Samuel Gray, killed on the &s;pot by a ball entering his head.</P>

<P>Me&s;&s;i'rs John Green, Robert Patter&s;on and David Parker: all dangerou&s;ly wounded.</P>
<P>The actors in this dreadful tragedy were a party of &s;oldiers commanded by Capt. Pre&s;ton of the 29th regiment: This party, including the Captain, con&s;i&s;ted of eight, who are all com|mitted to goal.</P>
<P>There are depo&s;itions in this affair which mention, that &s;everal guns were fired at the &s;ame time from the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e; before which this &s;hocking &s;cene was exhibited. Into this matter inqui&s;ition is now making.&mdash;In the mean time it may be proper to in&s;ert here the &s;ub&s;tance of &s;ome of tho&s;e depo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Benjamin Frizell, on the evening of the 5th of March, having taken his &s;tation near the we&s;t corner of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e in King&s;treet, be|fore and at the time of the &s;oldiers firing their guns, declares (among other things) that the fir&s;t di&s;charge was only of one gun, the next of two guns, upon which he the deponent thinks he &s;aw a man &s;tumble: the third di&s;charge was
<PB N="13" REF="011580_0013_0F8745AF0A4BE128">
of three guns, upon which he thinks he &s;aw two men fall, and immediately after were di&s;charged five guns, two of which were by &s;oldiers on his right hand, <HI>the other three, as appeared to the deponent, were di&s;charged from the balcony, or the chamber window of the</HI> CUSTOM-HOUSE, <HI>the fla&s;hes appearing on the left hand, and higher than the right hand fla&s;hes appeared to be, and of which the deponent was very &s;en&s;ible,</HI> altho' his eyes were much turned to the &s;oldiers, who were all on his right hand.</P>
<P>Gillam Ba&s;s, being in King-&s;treet at the &s;ame time, declares that they (the party of &s;oldiers from the main guard) po&s;ted them&s;elves between the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e door, and the we&s;t corner of it; and in a few minutes began to fire upon the people: <HI>Two or three of the fla&s;hes &s;o high above the re&s;t, that he the deponent verily believes they mu&s;t have come from the</HI> CUSTOM-HOUSE <HI>windows.</HI></P>
<P>Jeremiah Allen declares, that in the evening of the 5th day of March current, being at about nine o'clock in the front chamber in the hou&s;e occupied by Col. Inger&s;oll in King-&s;treet, he heard &s;ome guns fired, which occa&s;ioned his going in|to the balcony of the &s;aid hou&s;e.&mdash;That when he was in the &s;aid balcony in company with Mr. William Molineux jun'r. and John Simp&s;on, he heard the di&s;charge of four or five guns, the fla&s;hes of which appeared to be to the we&s;tward of the centry box, and immediately after, he the deponent <HI>heard two or three more guns and &s;aw
<PB N="14" REF="011580_0014_0F8745B063F8C168">
the fla&s;hes thereof from out of the hou&s;e, now cal|led the</HI> CUSTOM-HOUSE, <HI>as they evidently ap|peared to him,</HI> and which he the &s;aid deponent at the &s;ame time declared to the afore&s;aid Moli|neux and Simp&s;on being then near him, <HI>&s;aying to them,</HI> (at the &s;ame time pointing his hand to|wards the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e) <HI>there they are out of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>George Co&s;ter being in King-&s;treet at the time above mentioned, declares that in five or &s;ix mi|nutes after he &s;topped, he heard the word of command given to the &s;oldiers <HI>fire,</HI> upon which one gun was fired, which did no execution, as the deponent ob&s;erved, about half a minute after two guns, one of which killed one Samuel Gray a ropemaker, the other a molatto man, between which two men the deponent &s;tood, after this the deponent heard the di&s;charge of four or five guns more, by the &s;oldiers; immediately after which <HI>the deponent heard the di&s;charge of two guns or pi&s;tols, from an open window of the middle &s;tory of the</HI> CUSTOM-HOUSE, near to the place where the centry box is placed, and being but a &s;mall di&s;tance from the window, he heard the people from within &s;peak and laugh, and &s;oon after &s;aw the ca&s;ement lowered down; after which the deponent a&s;&s;i&s;ted others in carrying off one of the corps.</P>
<P>Cato, a Negro man, &s;ervant to Tuthill Hub|bart, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> declares, that on Monday evening the fifth of March current, on hearing the cry of fire, he ran into King&s;treet, where he &s;aw a number
<PB N="15" REF="011580_0015_0F8745B12D891EA8">
of people a&s;&s;embled before the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, that he &s;tood near the centry-box and &s;aw the &s;oldiers fire on the people, who &s;tood in the middle of &s;aid &s;treet; directly after which <HI>he &s;aw two fla&s;hes of guns, one quick upon the other, from the chamber window of the</HI> CUSTOM-HOUSE; and that after the firing was all over, while the people were carrying away the dead and wound|ed, <HI>he &s;aw the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e door opened, and &s;everal &s;oldiers (one of whom had a cutla&s;s) go into the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e</HI> and &s;hut the door after them.</P>
<P>Benjamin Andrews declares, that being de&s;ired by the committee of enquiry to take the ranges of the holes made by mu&s;quet balls, in two hou&s;es near oppo&s;ite to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, he finds the bullet hole in the entry door po&s;t of Mr. Payne's hou&s;e (and which graz'd the edge of the door, before it enter'd the po&s;t, where it lodged, two and a half inches deep) <HI>ranges ju&s;t under the &s;tool of the we&s;ternmo&s;t lower chamber window of the</HI> CUSTOM-HOUSE.</P>
<P>Samuel Drowne, towards the end of his depo|&s;ition (which contains a pretty full account of the proceedings of the &s;oldiers on the evening of the 5th in&s;tant) declares, that <HI>he &s;aw the fla&s;hes of two guns fired from the</HI> CUSTOM-HOUSE, <HI>one of which was out of a window of the chamber we&s;tward of the balcony, and the other from the balcony; the gun (which he clearly di&s;cerned) being pointed through the balli&s;ters, and the per|&s;on who held the gun, in a &s;tooping po&s;ture with|drew
<PB N="16" REF="011580_0016_0F8745B1E1C270D8">
him&s;elf into the hou&s;e, having a handker|chief or &s;ome kind of cloth over his face.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e depo&s;itions &s;hew clearly that a number of guns were fired from the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e.&mdash; As this affair is now enquiring into, all the no|tice we &s;hall take of it is, that it di&s;tingui&s;hes the actors in it into Street-Actors and Hou&s;e-Actors; which is nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>What gave occa&s;ion to the melancholy event of that evening &s;eems to have been this. A difference having happened near Mr. Gray's ropewalk, between a &s;oldier and a man belong|ing to it, the &s;oldier challenged the ropemakers to a boxing match. The challenge was accepted by one of them, and the &s;oldier wor&s;ted. He ran to the barrack in the neighbourhood, and returned with &s;everal of his companions. The fray was renewed, and the &s;oldiers were driven off. They &s;oon returned with recruits and were again wor&s;ted. This happened &s;everal times, till at length a con&s;iderable body of &s;oldiers was collected, and they al&s;o were driven off, the ropemakers having been joined by their brethren of the contiguous ropewalks. By this time Mr. Gray being alarmed interpo&s;ed, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome gentlemen prevented any further di&s;turbance. To &s;atisfy the &s;oldiers and puni&s;h the man who had been the occa&s;ion of the fir&s;t difference, and as an example to the re&s;t, he turned him out of his &s;ervice; and waited on Col. Dalrymple, the commanding officer of the troops, and with him concerted mea&s;ures for

At this time there were very few per&s;ons in the &s;treet be&s;ide them&s;elves.&mdash;This party in proceeding from Exchange lane into King-&s;treet mu&s;t pa&s;s the centry po&s;ted at the we&s;terly corner of the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e, which butts on that lane and fronts on that &s;treet. This is needful to be mentioned, as near that &s;pot and in that &s;treet the bloody tragedy was acted, and the &s;treet-ac|tors in it were &s;tationed: Their &s;tation being but a few feet from the front &s;ide of the &s;aid Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e.&mdash;The outrageous behavior and the threats of the &s;aid party occa&s;ioned the ringing of the meeting hou&s;e bell near the head of King-&s;treet: which bell ringing quick as for fire, it pre&s;ently brought out a number of the inhabi|tants, who being &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of the occa&s;ion of it, were naturally led to King-&s;treet, where the &s;aid party had made a &s;top but a little while before: and where their &s;topping had drawn to|gether a number of boys, round the centry at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e. Whether the boys mi&s;took the centry for one of the &s;aid party, and thence took occa&s;ion to differ with him, or whether he fir&s;t affronted them, which is affirmed in &s;everal depo|&s;itions,

&mdash;however that may be, there was much foul language between them: and &s;ome of them in con&s;equence of his pu&s;hing at them with his bayonet, threw &s;now balls at him:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since writing this narrative, &s;everal depo&s;itions have appeared, which make it clear, that the centry was fir&s;t in fault.&mdash;He overheard a barber's boy, &s;aying that a captain of the 14th (who had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by) was &s;o mean a fellow as not to pay his bar|ber for &s;having him; upon this the centry left his po&s;t and followed the boy into the middle of the &s;treet, where he told him to &s;hew his face; the boy pertly reply'd, I am not a&s;ham'd to &s;hew my face to any man: Upon this the centry gave him a &s;weeping &s;troke on the head with his mu&s;ket, which made him reel and &s;tagger and cry much. A fellow apprentice a&s;ked the centry what he meant by this abu&s;e? He reply'd, damn your blood, if you do not get out of the way I will give you &s;omething; and then fixed his bayonet and pu&s;hed at the lads, who both run out of his way. This di&s;pute collected a few per&s;ons about the boy near the cu&s;tom hou&s;e. Pre&s;ently after this, the party above-mentioned came into king&s;treet, which was a further occa&s;ion of drawing people thither, as above related. (See depo&s;ition of Benj<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. Broaders and others.)</NOTE> which occa|&s;ioned him to knock ha&s;tily at the door of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e. From hence two per&s;ons there|upon proceeded immediately to the main guard, which was po&s;ted (oppo&s;ite to the State-hou&s;e) at a &s;mall di&s;tance near the head of the &s;aid &s;treet. The officer on guard was Capt. Pre&s;ton, who with &s;even or eight &s;oldiers with fire arms, and charged bayonets, i&s;&s;ued from the guard hou&s;e, and in great ha&s;te po&s;ted him&s;elf and his &s;oldiers in the front of the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e near the cor|ner afore&s;aid. In pa&s;&s;ing to this &s;tation the &s;oldiers pu&s;hed &s;everal per&s;ons with their bay|onets, driving through the people in &s;o rough a manner that it appeared they intended to create a di&s;turbance. This occa&s;ioned &s;ome
<PB N="28" REF="011580_0028_0F8745BD20E013A0">
&s;now balls to be thrown at them: which &s;eems to have been the only provocation that was given. Mr. Knox (between whom and Capt. Pre&s;ton there was &s;ome conver&s;ation on the &s;pot) declares, that while he was talking with Capt. Pre&s;ton, the &s;oldiers of his detachment had attacked the people with their bayonets; and that there was not the lea&s;t provocation given to Capt. Pre&s;ton, or his party: the backs of the people being towards them when the people were attacked. He al&s;o declares, that Captain Pre&s;ton &s;eemed to be in great ha&s;te and much agitated; and that according to his opinion there were not then pre&s;ent in King&s;treet above &s;eventy or eighty per&s;ons at the extent.</P>
<P>The &s;aid party was formed into a half circle, and, within a &s;hort time after they had been po&s;ted at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, began to fire upon the people.</P>
<P>Capt. Pre&s;ton is &s;aid to have ordered them to fire, and to have repeated that order. One gun was fired fir&s;t: then others in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and with deliberation, till ten or a dozen guns were fired; or till that number of di&s;charges were made from the guns that were fired. By which means eleven per&s;ons were killed, and wounded, as above repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts with divers circum&s;tances attend|ing them, are &s;upported by the depo&s;itions of a con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons: and among others, of the following viz. Me&s;&s;ir's. Henry Ba&s;s Samuel Atwood, Samuel Drowne, James Kirk|wood,

Robert Polley, Samuel Condon, Daniel U&s;her, Jo&s;iah Simp&s;on, Henry Knox, Gillam Ba&s;s, John Hickling, Richard Palmes, Benjamin Frizzel, and others; who&s;e depo&s;itions are in the appendix.</P>
<P>Soon after the firing, a drum with a party from the main guard went to Murray's and the other barracks, beating an alarm as they went, which with the firing had the effect of a &s;ignal for action. Whereupon all the &s;oldiers of the 29th regiment, or the main body of them, appeared in King&s;treet under arms; and &s;eem|ed bent on a further ma&s;&s;acre of the inhabi|tants, which was with great difficulty prevented. They were drawn up between the State Hou&s;e and main guard: their lines extending acro&s;s the &s;treet and facing down King&s;treet, where the town-people were a&s;&s;embled. The fir&s;t line kneeled; and the whole of the fir&s;t plattoon pre|&s;ented their guns ready to fire, as &s;oon as the word &s;hould be given. They continued in that po&s;ture a con&s;iderable time. But by the good Providence of God, they were re&s;tained from firing.</P>
<P>That they then went into King&s;treet with &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition will appear probable by the two following depo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mary Gardner, living in Atkin&s;on &s;treet, declares, that on Monday evening the 5th of March current, and before the guns fired in King&s;treet, there were a number of &s;oldiers a&s;|&s;embled from Green's barracks towards the &s;treet, and oppo&s;ite to her gate; that they &s;tood very
<PB N="30" REF="011580_0030_0F8745C05B056778">
&s;till until the guns were fired in King&s;treet, then they clapped their hands and gave a cheer, &s;ay|ing, <HI>this is all that we want.</HI> They ran to their barrack, and came out again in a few minutes, all with their arms, and ran towards King&s;treet.</P>
<P>William Falla&s;s declares, that (after the mur|der in King&s;treet) on the evening of the 5th in&s;tant, upon his return home he had occa&s;ion to &s;top oppo&s;ite to the lane leading to Green's barracks, and while he &s;tood there, the &s;oldiers ru&s;hed by him with their arms, towards King|&s;treet, &s;aying, <HI>this is our time or chance:</HI> and that he never &s;aw men or dogs &s;o greedy for their prey as tho&s;e &s;oldiers &s;eemed to be, and the &s;ergeants could hardly keep them in their ranks.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances with tho&s;e already men|tioned, amount to a clear proof of a combination among them to commit &s;ome outrage upon the town on that evening; and that after the enor|mous one committed in King&s;treet, they intend|ed to add to the horrors of that night by mak|ing a further &s;laughter.</P>
<P>At the time Capt. Pre&s;ton's party i&s;&s;ued from the main guard, there were in King&s;treet about two hundred per&s;ons, and tho&s;e were collected there by the ringing of the bell in con&s;equence of the violences of another party, that had been there a very little while before. When Captain Pre&s;ton had got to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, &s;o great a part of the people di&s;per&s;ed at &s;ight of the &s;ol|diers, that not more than twenty or thirty then remained in King&s;treet, as Mr. Drowne declares,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Depo&s;ition.</NOTE>

<P>But after the firing, and when the &s;laughter was known, which occa&s;ioned the ringing of all the bells of the town, a large body of the inha|bitants &s;oon a&s;&s;embled in King&s;treet, and conti|nued there the whole time the 29th regiment was there under arms, and would not retire till that regiment and all the &s;oldiers that appeared, were ordered, and actually went, to their bar|racks: after which, having been a&s;&s;ured by the Lieutenant Governor, and a number of the civil magi&s;trates pre&s;ent, that every legal &s;tep &s;hould be taken to bring the criminals to ju&s;tice, they gradually di&s;per&s;ed.

<P>I am extremely &s;orry for the unhappy differences between the inhabitants and troops, and e&s;pecially for the action of the la&s;t evening, and I have ex|erted my&s;elf upon that occa&s;ion, that a due enquiry may be made, and that the law may have its cour&s;e.

It is not in my power to countermand tho&s;e orders. The Council have de&s;ired that the two regiments may be removed to the Ca&s;tle. From the particular concern which the <HI>29</HI>th regiment has had in your differences, Col.

<PB N="37" REF="011580_0036_0F8745C81E054D80">
<P>&rindx;IN the concluding Paragraph of the foregoing Nar|rative it is &s;aid, that the Town-Meeting was di&s;|&s;olved after the mea&s;ures were taken for the &s;ecurity of the Town in the night, by a &s;trong military watch.</P>
<P>Our implacable enemies, in pur&s;uance of their plan of mi&s;repre&s;entation, have taken pains to mi&s;repre&s;ent this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure, by declaring it to have been contrary to the mind of the Commander in Chief, and again&s;t Law.</P>
<P>This matter will be judged of, by &s;tating the fact, and producing the Law.</P>
<P>When the Committee, who had waited on the Lieutenant Governor, had reported to the Town, that the Troops would be removed to Ca&s;tle-I&s;land, (at which time it was near night) it was thought nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the Town, and for preventing a re&s;cue of the per&s;ons committed to goal for firing upon, and killing a number of, his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, that there &s;hould be a military watch: and divers Gentlemen were de&s;ired to take the needful &s;teps for that purpo&s;e. It being then night, it was impo&s;&s;ible a regular no|tification &s;hould i&s;&s;ue from the officers of the militia: a con|&s;iderable number of re&s;pectable per&s;ons therefore offered them&s;elves voluntiers, and did the duty of a military watch under the direction of the Lieutenant-Colonel, who attend|ed that &s;ervice with the approbation of the chief Colonel of the Bo&s;ton regiment. The next day, with two of the Select|men of the Town, the chief Colonel went to the Lieutenant-Governor, &amp; they informed him it was apprehended ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the Town, there &s;hould be a mili|tary watch kept; and that the Colonel then waited upon him to receive his orders. The Lieutenant Governor declined giving any orders concerning it, but &s;aid the Law was clear, that the Colonel, as chief officer of the regiment, might order a military watch; and that he might do about it as he thought fit. In con&s;equence of this, and knowing the Law gave him &s;uch a power, the Colonel i&s;&s;ued his orders for that purpo&s;e, &amp; a regular watch was kept the following night. The
<PB N="38" REF="011580_0037_0F8745C8A3BFDB00">
next day the Lieutenant Governor &s;ent for the Colonel, and let him know, that he was in doubt about the legality of the appointment of the military watch: and recommended to the Colonel to take good advice, whether he had a right by Law to order &s;uch a watch.</P>
<P>This being quite unexpected, occa&s;ioned the Colonel to expre&s;s him&s;elf with &s;ome fervor. He al&s;o &s;aid, he had already taken advice, and had no doubt of his own power; but had the preceeding day waited upon his Honor as Commander in Chief to receive his orders: which as his Honor had declined giving, and left the matter with him&s;elf, he had appointed a military watch: and judged it a nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure to quiet the fears and apprehen&s;ions of the town. The interview ended with the Lieut. Governor's recommending again, that the Colonel would take care to proceed according to law; and without his forbidding a military watch.</P>
<P>This military watch was continued every night, till Col. Dalrymple had cau&s;ed the two Regiments under his command to be removed to the barracks at Ca&s;tle-I&s;land. During the continuance of the watch, the Ju&s;tices of the Peace in their turns attended every night: and the utmo&s;t order and regula|rity took place through the whole of it.</P>
<P>This is the &s;tate of the fact, upon which every one is left to make his own ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Now for the Law: with re&s;pect to which nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than ju&s;t to recite it. It runs thus, "That there be military watches appointed and kept in every town, at &s;uch times, in &s;uch places, and in &s;uch numbers, and under &s;uch regulation, as the chief military officers of each town &s;hall appoint, or as they may receive orders from the chief officer of the regiment."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a Law of the Province for regulating the Militia. made in the 5th year of William and Mary, Chap. 7. Sect. 10.</NOTE>&mdash;This needs no comment. It clearly authorizes the chief officer of the regiment to appoint military watches. The late military watch in Bo&s;ton being founded on &s;uch an appointment was therefore according to Law.</P>

<P>I JOHN Gray, of lawful age, te&s;tify and &s;ay, that on the Saturday preceeding the ma&s;&s;acre on the Monday evening of the 5th in&s;tant, Middleton the chimney-&s;weeper being at my hou&s;e, &s;aid to my maid, as &s;he informed me, that he was well acquainted with the &s;oldiers, and they had determined to have their revenge of the rope-walk people; being alarmed with this news, I determined to &s;ee Col. Dalrymple on Monday morning. At &s;abbath noon I was &s;urpriz'd at hearing that Col. Carr, and his officers had enter'd my rope-walk, open'd the windows, doors, &amp;c. giving out that they were &s;earching for a dead &s;erjeant of their regiment; this put me upon im|mediately waiting upon Col. Dalrymple, to whom I related

what I under&s;tood had pa&s;&s;ed at the rope-walk days before, he reply'd it was much the &s;ame as he had heard from his people; but &s;ays he, "your man was the aggre&s;&s;or in affront|ing one of my people, by a&s;king him if he wanted to work, and then telling him to clean his little-hou&s;e." For this expre&s;&s;ion I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my journeyman on the Monday morning following; and further &s;aid, I would do all in my power to prevent my peoples giving them any affront in future. He then a&s;&s;ur'd me, he had, and &s;hould do every thing in his power to keep his &s;oldiers in order, and prevent their any more entering my in|clo&s;ure. Pre&s;ently after, Col. Carr came in, and a&s;ked Col. Dalrymple what they &s;hould do, for they were daily lo&s;ing their men; that three of his grenadiers pa&s;&s;ing quietly by the rope-walks were greatly abus'd, and one of them &s;o much beat that he would die. He then &s;aid he had been &s;earching for a &s;erjeant who had been murder'd; upon which, I &s;aid, Yes Colonel, I hear you have been &s;earching for him in my rope-walks; and a&s;ked him, whether that &s;erjeant had been in the affray there on the Friday; he reply'd, no: for he was &s;een on the Saturday. I then a&s;ked him, how he could think of looking for him in my walks; and that had he apply'd to me, I would have waited on him, and opened every apart|ment I had for his &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>I Nathaniel Fo&s;dick, of lawful age, te&s;tify and &s;ay, that on the night of the fifth in&s;tant, betwixt the hours of nine and ten o'clock, being in my hou&s;e with my family, hear|ing the bells ring for fire ran out to a&s;&s;i&s;t the inhabitants, ran towards the north; when I came to the town-hou&s;e I &s;ee the people running down king&s;treet, I followed, when I came by the guard-hou&s;e I &s;ee &s;ome &s;oldiers come out and fix their bayonets, I ran to know where the fire was, after I had got into king&s;treet I made a halt, as I &s;topt I was pu&s;hed behind, I turn'd round and &s;aw &s;ome &s;oldiers with their bayonets charged, which came again&s;t me. I a&s;ked them if this was the fire that is cry'd; they made no an&s;wer. I a&s;k'd them what they meant by coming on me in that manner; their an&s;wer was, <HI>Damn you, &s;tand out of our way.</HI> I told them I would not move for no man under the heavens. I offended no one. Therefore they pa&s;&s;ed me, &s;ome on my right and &s;ome on my left. I followed behind them, they went to the centry-box
<PB N="37" REF="011580_0074_0F8745ED22C4E8D0">
and faced round and form'd in a half-circle. I &s;aw a number of people near the middle of king&s;treet, about twenty yards from the centry-box. I &s;poke out and de&s;ired that no di&s;tur|bance might be betwixt the inhabitants and the &s;oldiers, for if the &s;oldiers were in fault, there was their officer, which I look'd upon to be the officer of the day, and he could &s;ettle the affair in one minute; then I &s;pake to two men to &s;peak to the offi|cer; then I &s;ee two or three advance towards the officer. I heard &s;ome words pa&s;s, what they were I know not, I turned round and &s;pake to the people to &s;tep off and let them that went to the officer &s;ettle the di&s;pute, the people &s;tanding &s;till, <HI>I turned towards the officer and &s;ee him fall into the regular circle, then I heard the word</HI> FIRE, on my left one gun was fir'd off by a &s;oldier on their right. Upon which I ru&s;hed in, then &s;eeing the fir&s;t &s;oldier that fired run at &s;ome per&s;ons and fall upon the ground, I hallow'd to take his gun from him, then <HI>I received three pu&s;hes by their bayonets, two in my left arm and one in my brea&s;t, that at my brea&s;t I &s;truck off with a &s;tick, and the gun went off in&s;tantly.</HI> Then I drew back, and finding one dead, as I thought, on my left and one on my right, I then run over to quaker-lane, where I &s;aw a number of people, I de&s;ired them to &s;tep out and keep the &s;oldiers from getting off; from thence I went over to the other &s;ide the &s;treet, to the lane near the town watch-hou&s;e, where I de&s;ired the people to &s;tep out, and not to let the &s;oldiers get off, for I would go home and get my gun and bring a party again&s;t them, which I did, but meet|ing &s;ome of the inhabitants returning, they told me the &s;oldiers were gone off and affairs would be &s;ettled to-morrow, on that I went home.</P>

But when I got to the town-pump, we were told there was a rumpus at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e door; Mr. Spear &s;aid to me you had better not go, I told him I would go and try to make peace; I immediately went there and &s;aw <HI>Capt.

<P>I John Wil&s;on of lawful age te&s;tify, that on monday even|ing the 5th current, I was at Mr. Burdett's at the head of long-lane, and heard the bells ring and fire cried, and there|upon went in company with others to king-&s;treet, and &s;aw no di&s;turbance there, hearing the bells &s;till ringing, I a&s;ked what was the matter? The people &s;aid the &s;oldiers had in&s;ulted the inhabitants, on which I went to Cornhill, where the bu&s;tle had been, and found no &s;oldiers there. Then I came down King|&s;treet oppo&s;ite the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and &s;aw a man with a light colour'd &s;urtout coming from the main guard go up to the centry, and lay his hand on his &s;houlder and &s;peak &s;ome words to the centry, and then <HI>enter the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e door.</HI> On this the centry grounded the breech of his gun, took out a cartridge, primed and loaded, and &s;houlder'd his firelock. After this I drew back oppo&s;ite Mr. Stone's, &amp; in a few minutes &s;aw a party of &s;oldiers headed by <HI>an officer</HI> coming down from the main guard, crying to the inhabitants, <HI>Damn you, make way you boogers!</HI> I not moving from my place was &s;truck by one of them on the hip with the butt of his mu&s;quet, which brui&s;ed me &s;o much that it was next day very &s;ore, and much di&s;|coloured. <HI>The officer</HI> &s;eeing the &s;oldier &s;trike me <HI>&s;aid to the &s;oldier in an angry manner why don't you prick the boogers?</HI> The party drew up before the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e door, and ranged to the we&s;t corner in a half circle, and charged their pieces brea&s;t high. Some &s;mall boys coming up made a noi&s;e to the &s;oldiers, on which <HI>the officer &s;aid to them why don't you fire? Damn you fire!</HI> They hereupon fired and two men fell dead

in my &s;ight. I then left the place, and went over the &s;treet and a&s;&s;i&s;ted Patter&s;on the wounded man in getting home.

<P>I Thomas Jack&s;on jun'r. do te&s;tify and declare that on Mon|day the 5th in&s;tant in the evening, being in company, I heard, (as near as I can recollect) between nine and ten o'clock, a drum beat to arms, I immediately told the gentleman (with whom I was then engaged) I imagin'd there was &s;ome di&s;tur|bance between the inhabitants and the &s;oldiery, he replied, foh, I believe it is nothing but boys, I told him I was afraid there was &s;omething more in it than that, and de&s;ired him (as the drum approached us) to look out of the window to &s;ee whether they were &s;oldiers, or not. He immediately opened the window, and told me they were &s;oldiers. Upon this in|formation, I immediately put on my hat and went out. I had not gone many paces before I met a man, of whom I enquired the rea&s;on of the drum beating. He told me there were &s;ix men killed in king&s;treet by the military: I immediately ha&s;ten|ed on in my way to king&s;treet, and met another per&s;on by Concert-hall, of whom I likewi&s;e enquired as afore&s;aid; his an&s;wer to me corre&s;ponded with the other. When I got into king&s;treet, I found a great number of people there a&s;&s;embled, and intended going into the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, to find out the particulars of the affair. Upon my knocking at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e door with the knocker, Mr. Hammond Green (who was then looking out of the window) a&s;k'd me Who was there?

<P>I Thomas Greenwood of lawful age, te&s;tify and &s;ay, that on Monday the 5th in&s;tant &s;pending the evening at Mrs. Whee|ler's, I was alarmed by the bells ringing and people's crying fire, upon which I turn'd out with Mrs. Wheeler's three &s;ons and help'd Mr. Wheeler's engine as far as the Old South meet|ing hou&s;e, we met &s;everal people who told us it was not fire, but it was the <HI>&s;oldiers and inhabitants, fighting in king&s;treet and de&s;ired them to go back and get their arms,</HI> upon hearing this, I ha&s;tened down to king&s;treet and coming near the we&s;t door of the town hou&s;e, I fell in with a <HI>number</HI> of people, mo&s;t of them that I &s;aw had &s;ticks and clubs in their hands and huzza'd, af|ter that we went round the north &s;ide of the town hou&s;e, and &s;tood between the ea&s;t &s;teps of the town hou&s;e and whipping-po&s;t, I heard a number of people &s;peaking, and <HI>one per&s;on in par|ticular</HI> &s;poke to the two centinels, who were walking up and down the &s;treet on the &s;ide of the town hou&s;e, u&s;ing the&s;e words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may not be improper to remark here, that the deponent, Thomas Greenwood, is a hired &s;ervant to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, on whom he is altogether dependent, and when before the Ju&s;|tices, he was &s;everal times detected in plain fal&s;hoods; parti|cularly in &s;wearing fir&s;t that the number of per&s;ons who called the &s;oldiers "bloody back ra&s;cals," &amp;c. was nine, then &s;even, and finally but one, as it now &s;tands; and through the whole of his examination he was &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent and &s;o frequently contradicted him&s;elf, that all pre&s;ent were convinced no credit ought to be given to his depo&s;ition, for which rea&s;on it would not have been in&s;erted had it not been known that a depo&s;ition was taken relating to this affair, from this Greenwood, by Ju&s;|tice Murray, and carried home by Mr. Robin&s;on.</NOTE> <HI>come out and fight us if you dare,</HI> calling them <HI>Damn'd bloody back ra&s;cals and &s;coundrels to come out and fight them,</HI> if they dared, We are enough for you now, <HI>but I do not know whether the above per&s;on belonged to the town</HI>; I looked round and &s;aw about twenty people before the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e door, upon which I went down to the cu&s;tom hou&s;e, I then heard two or
<PB N="76" REF="011580_0113_0F87461640B38120">
three per&s;ons u&s;e the&s;e words, one after another,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As this deponent is the only per&s;on out of a great number of witne&s;&s;es examined, who heard any mention made of the Cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e, and as it is very uncommon for &s;everal people to repeat exactly the &s;ame words upon &s;uch occa&s;ions (for the deponent in&s;i&s;ted that the identical words were u&s;ed by each per&s;on) con&s;idering the character and connections of the deponent, and his own expre&s;s declaration in this affidavit, that he &s;aw no per&s;on attempt even to break a &s;quare of gla&s;s or to get into the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, it may very ju&s;tly be doubted whether &s;uch words were u&s;ed by any one.</NOTE> <HI>I wi&s;h I could get into the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e, I would make the money circulate among&s;t us,</HI> after that I went up to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e door and &s;aw 2 or 3 &s;now balls fall on the flat &s;tones near the &s;teps of the door; I knock'd and Mr. Hammond Green came to the door, while I was &s;peaking to the centry, who &s;tood upon the &s;teps, I told him not to let any body come into the door and no per&s;on of|fer'd to come in; the &s;aid Green a&s;k'd who was there, I an|&s;wer'd 'tis Thomas, let me in Hammond, when I got in, the &s;aid Green &s;aid to me if I wanted to &s;ee any thing, go up &s;tairs, I went into the back room and got the key of the little draw|ing-room, being the lower we&s;t corner chamber, and went up &s;tairs, and Elizabeth Avery, Mary Rogers and Ann Green followed me into the room; we all looked thro' the gla&s;s, I &s;aw &s;ome per&s;ons &s;tanding by the centry-box &s;triking with &s;ticks, <HI>but did not &s;ee them hit any body, tho' a number of per&s;ons were clo&s;e by them</HI>; I told the women above mentioned that I would not &s;tay, for I was afraid that the hou&s;e would be pull|ed down, there being about <HI>forty or fifty per&s;ons con&s;i&s;ting of men and boys; I &s;aw no per&s;on throw any &s;tones or attempt to break even a &s;quare of gla&s;s, or get into the hou&s;e (the next morning I found there was not a pane of gla&s;s broke in the &s;aid hou&s;e.)</HI> Afterwards, I went down &s;tairs and met Hammond Green in the middle room; he a&s;ked me where I was going, I told him, I was going out, upon which I went into the kitchen and took my hat and went into the yard, got upon the wood pile and went to the fence; John Green being by the gate a&s;ked me to open the gate and let him in, I told him I would not open the gate for any body, one per&s;on pa&s;&s;ing by, &s;aid to me, heave over &s;ome &s;halales, I jump'd off the fence into royal exchange lane, went down the lane with John Green, and went round by the po&s;t-office to the main-guard; I told one of the &s;oldiers if they did not go
<PB N="77" REF="011580_0114_0F8746165EC67E88">
down to the centry at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems very difficult, according to Greenwood's account, to form even a conjecture of the rea&s;on of his fears, which he ex|pre&s;&s;ed for the centry, when in the &s;ame breath he declares that he had not &s;een any per&s;on in&s;ult him.&mdash;But probably the true motives of his application to the main-guard were not of a nature to be made public.</NOTE> <HI>I was afraid they would hurt him, tho' I had not &s;een any per&s;on in&s;ult him,</HI> &s;ome|body &s;aid they were gone; I &s;tood with John Green near the guard-hou&s;e, &s;aw the guns go off and heard the report; after|wards <HI>I heard a per&s;on &s;ay, which I took to be a &s;oldier, that's right, damn them, kill them all, they have no bu&s;ine&s;s there,</HI> and from thence I went to the hou&s;e of Mr. Burch, one of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, where I &s;aw Mr. Burch and wife, Mr. Paxton ano|ther Commi&s;&s;ioner, and Mr. Reeves &s;ecretary to the Board; one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners a&s;ked me what was the matter, I told him the &s;oldiers had fired upon the inhabitants and had killed two or three, and wounded &s;ome more, upon which Mr. Reeves &s;aid, God ble&s;s my &s;oul, and then went into the other room. I left Mr. Burch's hou&s;e and went to the barracks at Wheelwright's Wharf, and &s;taid there all night; <HI>I heard &s;eve|ral &s;oldiers &s;ay they wi&s;h'd they were let out, for if they were, there &s;hould not be many people alive in the morning</HI>; the whole of the 14th regiment being under arms, and the piquet guard went to the main guard hou&s;e about 12 o'clock that night.</P>
