<P>THE reader is here pre&s;ented with not only the tragi|cal di&s;&s;olution of one of our fellow mortals, but al&s;o &s;ome of the in&s;truments made u&s;e of by the enemy of &s;ouls, in order to bring about this di&s;a&s;trous event. We frequently hear the people of God pray that he would rule our rulers; and that all our great men might &s;peedily become good men; a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well: but an an&s;wer to tho&s;e prayers has never yet been fully given: for in peru|&s;ing the following lines, you may be able to make the di&s;cove|ry of no le&s;s than three of the magi&s;trates of this county&punc; who have (in the hand of Satan) been (I do not &s;ay de&s;ignedly) in&s;trumental, in bringing about, not only the untimely di&s;&s;o+lution of our worthy and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">iend Dr. <HI>I&s;aac Smith</HI> but al&s;o in bringing <HI>John</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ituation, that nothin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hort of d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> could <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> ju&s;tice, and pay the

debt which he ju&s;tly owed to the laws of his country. The fir&s;t thing of this nature which (in the cour&s;e of his &s;peech) comes under our con&s;ideration is the &s;eeming kindne&s;s exerci&s;ed towards him, by one of our magi&s;trates, who after taking the pi&s;tols from him (with which he was armed) in&s;tead of treating him with that degree of contempt, which &s;uch conduct loud|ly called for, and which might have detered him and others from any future conduct of &s;o diabolical a nature: I &s;ay, in|&s;tead of dealing with him according to the directions of law, for &s;o great a breach of our peace he only deprived him of his arms for five or &s;ix weeks; and then returned them to him again. The &s;econd indulgence of this kind, is &s;till more contemptible than the fir&s;t: For Ryer, being met by a magi|&s;trate, no le&s;s a per&s;on than E&s;q. J. B&mdash;, who, after di&s;co|vering his arms, in&s;tead of giving due attention to the di&s;|charge of his duty, and u&s;ing all lawful means for the promo|tion of our peace (which peace he was &s;olemnly bound to ob&s;erve) he connived at his unlawful conduct, and told him in a very delicate manner, he appeared to be a dangerous man, and pa&s;&s;ed it off with a &s;mile.&mdash;We will now attend to a di&s;play of the gro&s;s ignorance, of another of our magi|&s;trates, in telling John Ryer, that in the di&s;charge of his duty as a civil officer, if he crowded upon any per&s;on, in order to make him a pri&s;oner; and got killed in the attempt, there was no redre&s;s to be obtained.&mdash;From the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions, may we not &s;uppo&s;e that there was a notion, in&s;tilled into the mind of Ryer, that he was almo&s;t excu&s;able for car|rying arms again&s;t the officers of our country; and that a belief (which he had borrowed from the authority) that it was no great crime for a man to defend him&s;elf in &s;uch a &s;ituation, was what &s;timulated him to &s;trike the fatal &s;troke, and cau&s;e a &s;eparation to take place between the &s;oul and body of our much re&s;pected friend. He very plainly tells us, that at a certain time, he was &s;o countenanced by a per&s;on in authority, that it impre&s;&s;ed on his mind an idea, that there was &s;ome degree of ju&s;tice in his conduct. Let us therefore, ince&s;|&s;antly offer up our petitions to Heaven; that the Ruler of the Univer&s;e, might repleni&s;h the hearts of our rulers with grace and wi&s;dom; for our land loudly groans, to obtain deliverance, from the burt<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">n with which &s;he is oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE, And Dying Speech, of JOHN RYER.</HEAD>
<P>I JOHN RYER, was born at the Manor of Fordom, in the town and county of We&s;tche&s;ter and &s;tate of New-York, the 15th day of February, 1759, of &s;ober, hone&s;t, and reputable parents, and was put to &s;chool in my youth, but was not con|tinued there long; &s;o that my education was hardly tolerable. My father being de&s;titute of any other help, occa&s;ioned me to be put to labour on the farm; and continued at the farming bu&s;ine&s;s with him, until &s;pring of the year 79 or 80, when I left my father; and went to live with my grand mother, at the &s;aid Manor of Fordom; where I continued for the &s;pace of 9 or 10 months; was then taken a pri|&s;oner by the guides belonging to the continental army, was kept in pri&s;on about one week, when eleven others, with my&s;elf broke guard made our e&s;cape, and then went to New-York, where I tarried but a &s;hort time, but went to a place called Morri&s;ena; and imbodied in a militia core under Capt. Cu&s;&s;er; belonging to a regiment commanded by Col. James De-Lancy, where I fell in with &s;uch company, as introduced me to many of the vices of the world; &s;uch as exce&s;s of drinking, card-playing, cock-fighting, cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, together with almo&s;t every kind of vice, wick|edne&s;s and debauchery. But tho&s;e evils with which I was the mo&s;t delighted&punc; was card-playing and cock-fighting; which (together with every other evil) I would advi&s;e young people to endeavour to &s;hun; for tho&s;e evils, have a peculiar tendency, to allure the mind; and are the common &s;ources from whence all evil doth flow; after continuing there a while, and thus mi&s;pending my precious time, I went into the country, with a body of troops which reconnoitred around and returned again to Morri&s;ena: where I continued for &s;ome con&s;iderable time. After a while, my father was taken and confined by Col. De-Lancy: I then returned to live with my mother and family, where I continued until my father was re&s;tored to his liberty. I then went with my father and his family to New-York, in the winter of the year 1781; where I was married to a girl of a reputable family, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e endowments that are nece&s;&s;ary, to make life contented and happy; with whom I lived about ten years, with all the agreeablene&s;s that a married life could afford. But &s;till indulged my&s;elf in my former vices, &s;uch as com|pany-keeping, card-playing, and cock-fighting until my mind got &s;o &s;trongly attached to tho&s;e practices, that I had but little power over my own will; and it &s;eemed almo&s;t beyond my power to re|frain from them.</P>
<P>After marrying my wife I lived about 9 or 10 months, in a room hired in Prince-&s;treet, (during which time I belonged to the engi|neer department) where I continued until the clo&s;e of the War.&mdash; Then moved to my father's, at the afore&s;aid Manor of Fordom;
<PB N="6" REF="046873_0007_102245310F67C960">
where I lived about one year, from thence moved with my family, to White Plains, in the &s;aid county, on a farm, belonging to one of my uncles where I lived near four years; during which time, there was &s;everal in&s;tances occured, that are too ruinous to &s;ociety for me to pa&s;s by, without &s;peaking &s;omething to them; hoping thereby that this may be a warning to others; that they may &s;hun tho&s;e evils which has (through inattention) plunged me into one of the mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation that can (in this life) befall a poor un|happy wretch as I am. The fir&s;t, of which was a wrangle with one of my nighe&s;t neighbours, to wit, Benjamin Lyon: I, by being urged on by others reviled him with unbecoming language and vain reproaches, but did not carry the matter to &s;uch an ex|treme as to lay my&s;elf open to the law: This controver&s;y broke up a communication between us as neighbours: which introduced many inconveniences that commonly attend di&s;putes of this kind, and prove di&s;tructive to &s;ociety.&mdash;I &s;hall now &s;peak of a very di&s;a|greeable wrangle that took place between Daniel Mertine and my&s;elf; who (by marriage) was my uncle: he lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e and occupied a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rt of the &s;ame farm, which I did: One day while at work in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">e garden, he came out in a great rage and immediately began a wrangle with me; which continued but a &s;hort, time, before he layed hands upon me in order to appea&s;e his anger; we were then parted by &s;ome of the by&s;tanders and I readily gave up that method of &s;eeking revenge and told him I would make application to the authority in order to get redre&s;s: He made u&s;e of &s;ome threats, in order to deter me from putting my de&s;ign into execution; I however, went to a magi&s;trate, complain|ed of his treatment and had a warrant i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him: 'Twas not long before the di&s;pute broke forth again and his wife engaging in the wrangle, attacked me with a fire-&s;hovel, and I retreating from her being armed with a weapon of the &s;ame kind, by parrying off the blows the &s;hovel glanced, &s;truck her forhead and wounded her &s;o that the blood gu&s;hed forth: She (together with her hu&s;band) went on with threats in an extreme degree of revengeful language; and I &s;carcely knew what method to take in order to make my&s;elf &s;ecure; they immediately went to a ju&s;tice of the peace, in order to get a warrant again&s;t me: I then to &s;ecure my&s;elf from their fury, armed my&s;elf with pi&s;tols; and within a &s;hort time after, was be|fore the magi&s;trate with them and had my pi&s;tols with me.&mdash;Mer|tine informed the ju&s;tice that I carried arms again&s;t him; the ju&s;tice inquired of me if it was true? I told him yes; whereupon he took them from me; and kept them for five or &s;ix weeks and then re|turned them to me again. After the di&s;pute between, Mertine and I was ended, I moved again to the Manor of Fordom, where I lived until the year 1789. when I began to buy beaves, kill and &s;ell out to my neighbours, which continued for three years together; for &s;ome of the cattle I was credited, and &s;ome of the meat I &s;old upon credit, and could not collect the money; which was due for the &s;ame; by which means, I found my&s;elf unable to make remitance to my
<PB N="7" REF="046873_0008_10224533A3F36268">
creditors; who were continually calling on me for money.&mdash; A report was rai&s;ed and circulated abroad, that the place I was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, was to be taken from me and &s;old; which le&s;&s;ened my credit among people and which circum&s;tance &s;o in&s;tantly alarmed my creditors that they thought proper (mo&s;t generally) to pre&s;s me for the collection of the debts due from me to them, and for that purpo&s;e had recour&s;e to compul&s;ive means by in&s;titu|ting law &s;uits again&s;t me. At a particular time one of my credi|tors threatened me with impri&s;onment unle&s;s I made him pay|ment, and &s;aid many things again&s;t me, &s;peaking in a reproach|ful language, which had &s;uch undue influence on my mind and enraged me in &s;uch a manner as to rai&s;e tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions to which human frailty is liable, that I was induced to carry Pi&s;tols in order to keep off the public officers until after the court of com|mon pleas which was in a few days to &s;et at Bedford. At the &s;ame time there was a law-&s;uit pending again&s;t me before a certain ju&s;tice of the peace who was then holding a court at a hou&s;e occupied by Levi Hunt, at We&s;tche&s;ter; I approached within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the hou&s;e, was met there by the &s;aid ju&s;tice when he di&s;covered me with a pi&s;tol and drawn &s;word, and acco&s;ted me with the&s;e words&mdash;Ryer, you appear like a very dangerous per&s;on &mdash; and pa&s;&s;ed it off with a &s;mile. I afterwards being much irritated as afore&s;aid, and &s;till receiving the threats from the per&s;on afore&s;aid, reque&s;ted him to arm him&s;elf, and put him&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;ituation I was in, to meet me and decide the quarrel aforementioned. This unfortunate di&s;pute being countenanced by a per&s;on in authority impre&s;&s;ed on my mind an idea that there was &s;ome degree of ju&s;tice in my conduct, and by degrees I became more and more aver&s;e to the laws of my country. &mdash;I was cho&s;en con&s;table and collector in the town of We&s;tche&s;ter in the year 1791, and executed that office for that year: During the execution and continuance of the &s;ame, I had a warrant deli|vered to me to &s;erve by a certain magi&s;trate, who at the time he handed me the &s;ame, he a&s;ked me if I knew the duty of a con&s;ta|ble, I an&s;wered that for want of longer experience I had not a perfect knowledge of my duty; he then told me that if I had a warrant again&s;t any per&s;on I was not obliged to croud upon him or run the ri&s;que of my life, for if I did, and got killed in the attempt, there was no &s;atisfaction to be obtained for it. I was induced from the &s;ituation of my property and the conduct of my creditors (one of whom in particular appeard very pre&s;&s;ing) &s;till to continue carrying arms. On the &s;eventeenth of May, 1792, I went from my hou&s;e at the &s;aid Manor of Fordom, to Mr. De-Lancy's Mill, to get &s;ome grain ground, and on my return home, I called at Levi Hunt's Inn, to enquire for &s;ome per&s;ons I wanted to &s;ee; when I came there I di&s;covered &s;everal people in the hou&s;e playing at cards; I was invited to di&s;mount my hor&s;e come in and join them to play for &s;ome liquor, which I very readily a&s;&s;en|ted to, being very fond of that exerci&s;e: I had not been there long before Williams Hunt, then a con&s;table of<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> We&s;tche&s;ter, came into the hou&s;e and went <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> any,

di&s;cour&s;e taking place except my biding him to &s;tand off, he an|&s;wered he was coming no nigher, (&s;ome few words more were &s;po|ken which I cannot particularly recollect) when &s;aid Hunt left the hou&s;e. I went to the door holding a gla&s;s of liquor in one hand, and a pi&s;tol in the other, and invited him to drink with me, when (after drinking with me) I returned to the table where the com|pany were &s;till playing cards, and &s;eated my&s;elf between the ta|ble and the door leading into the bedroom, oppo&s;ite the front door, being in that &s;ituation, di&s;covered a per&s;on by the name of I&s;aac Smith, a deputy &s;heriff, who I did not know upon fir&s;t &s;ight coming into the hou&s;e and making his way with great &s;peed tow|ards the place where I was &s;eated in order (I &s;uppo&s;ed) to make me his pri&s;oner; I being put in great confu&s;ion immediately &s;nap|ed at him one of the pi&s;tols, with which I was armed, having pre|viou&s;ly bidden him to &s;tand off, he then &s;aid I was his pri&s;oner, and demanded a&s;&s;i&s;tance, there being in the room at the &s;ame time &s;everal per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the company with whom I had been &s;pending a part of the afternoon at cards, a young man by the name of John Palmer, who was &s;itting by my &s;ide, &s;aid he had not touched me, and Levi Hunt, junr. who was &s;itting on the other &s;ide of me, al&s;o &s;aid, he had only touched his, and Levi Hunt's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.
