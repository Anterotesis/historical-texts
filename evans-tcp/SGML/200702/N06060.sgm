<P>It mu&s;t be looked upon as a real Smile and &s;ignal Favour of Heaven upon our military En|terpri&s;es, that divine Providence calls and di&s;|po&s;es, one and another of his faithful Servants in the Mini&s;try, to go forth with, and become Teachers of our Army: Such a one I look upon the Author of the following &s;uitable and affect|ing Di&s;cour&s;e to be; through which he breathes forth Love to his glorious Ma&s;ter, and his deare&s;t Intere&s;t; as well as a Heart di&s;po&s;ed to comply with the Call of Providence, and follow the Lamb where&s;oever he leads, as one entirely re|&s;igned to his Lord's Will.&mdash;May Almighty GOD fa&s;ten deep the&s;e parting Coun&s;els, on the Hearts of his dear People; keep them, feed

<P>And they all wept &s;ore, and fell upon <HI>Paul</HI>'s Neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him: Sorrowing mo&s;t of all for the Words which he &s;pake, that they &s;hould &s;ee his Face no more. And they accompanied him to the Ship.&mdash;</P></Q>

<P>SUCH is the State of this World wherein we dwell, and &s;uch the Nature of Things here, that we can find nothing certain or permanent, but all Things in a con&s;tant Fluctuation, and we are pre&s;ented with a Scene of uninterrupted Change. &mdash;What Being then, endued with rational Powers, and acting like it&s;elf, can chu&s;e his Portion here, or vainly expect Happine&s;s in the Fruition of &s;uch changing and uncertain Trifles, as all the Creatures of Time, and Objects of Sen&s;e are?&mdash;As we find a con&s;tant Vici&s;&s;itude, every Good in the Creature mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be uncertain; &s;o that what we call our Property To-day, may be in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another To-morrow; and what we have rai&s;ed Expectations of enjoying, may never be ours. The Events of the pre|&s;ent Moment we &s;ee, but who can tell what will happen the next? All before us is dark and unknown, ex|cept what is di&s;covered by divine Revelation, or de|pends upon the Promi&s;e of eternal Truth.&mdash;No
<PB N="2" REF="007695_0005_102D9AFFF46E5530">
Wonder then, that &s;uch as di&s;card Revelation, not only become Sceptics, but fully commence a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">om|pli&s;h'd Athei&s;ts, in the I&s;&s;ue.&mdash;We may look back and view tho&s;e changing Scenes of an all-wi&s;e Pro|vidence, that we have pa&s;s'd through; Peace and War, Sickne&s;s and Health, Adver&s;ity and Pro&s;pe|rity, and &s;et the one over again&s;t the other: But if we look forward to a Space of Futurity, equal to that of our pa&s;t Lives, who can &s;ay what &s;hall hap|pen? Shall not mo&s;t, or all of us, be in the eternal World, where we &s;hall &s;ee no more Changes? Ble&s;&s;ed &s;urely, and happy is he, that watcheth and keepeth his Garments.&mdash;</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip is one of the &s;tricte&s;t Bonds, and &s;weet|e&s;t Enjoyments of human Nature; yet by Rea&s;on of the changeable State of Things, this al&s;o is Vanity, and a Preparatory to Sorrow; for deare&s;t Friends mu&s;t part, and the &s;tronge&s;t Ties of Nature be di&s;|&s;olved; the mo&s;t kind and generous Benefactor, the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, obliging and agreeable Companion, the mo&s;t &s;ure and faithful Friend, mu&s;t be removed; <HI>Lover and Friend will be put far from us, and our Ac|quaintance into Darkne&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. 88, 18.</P>
<P>It is a mo&s;t amiable, as well as e&s;&s;ential Property of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that it di&s;po&s;es to Love and Kindne&s;s. Benevolence truly &s;o called, and brotherly Love are peculiar to the real Di&s;ciples of <HI>Je&s;us-Chri&s;t.</HI> Though from Con&s;titution, or what is called, natural Temper, &s;ome may appear to be more amicable, kind and obliging, than others; yet that gracious Di&s;po&s;ition, which the Go&s;pel calls brotherly Love, has &s;omething truly divine, in its Nature; and is &s;pecifically different from any Thing that meer Nature does, or can produce, in fallen and depraved Humanity; there is &s;omething from Heaven rendered vi&s;ible in the Object, which &s;uitably influences the Subject: The divine Image, or Re&s;emblance of God's
<PB N="3" REF="007695_0006_102D9B0323711308">
moral Perfections in the Former, and an agreeable Temper, or Reli&s;h for moral Beauty in the Latter, whence Love ari&s;es in the Subject towards its Objects, from proper and genuine Motives.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Felicity of the heavenly State con&s;i&s;ts in per|fect Love, Freedom from Sin, and the full immediate Fruition of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed God, who is the Sum and Comprehen&s;ion, of all Glory, Excellency, Per|fection and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and ju&s;t &s;o far as we are di&s;|po&s;ed to love God here, and one another, upon the &s;ame Grounds, and from the &s;ame Motives, as the ble&s;&s;ed, and perfectly holy Inhabitants of the World of Glory, love God and one another; ju&s;t &s;o far are we real Chri&s;tians, and no farther. Such a divine Temper as this, &s;uch a Reli&s;h for moral Excellency, in the real undi&s;&s;embled Di&s;ciples of our ble&s;&s;ed Em|manuel, was the Source of all that Grief which po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed their Hearts, and Spring of tho&s;e Rivers of Tears, which flowed from their Eyes, at the De|parture of Paul, their &s;piritual Father, the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>In the Words of our Text, the <HI>Holy-Gho&s;t</HI> inti|mates, that it was not meerly the Apo&s;tle's Depar|ture for a Sea&s;on, that &s;o deeply affected their Hearts, but it was this Expre&s;&s;ion of his, <HI>That they &s;hould &s;ee his Face no more,</HI> which pierced them to the very Center of their Souls.&mdash;The ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle went up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> expecting Per&s;ecution, and his Expec|tation met with no Di&s;appointment; hence the Di&s;|ciples greatly fear'd, or rather rea&s;onably concluded, that they &s;hould &s;ee his Face no more. Now the dark and gloomy Moment was come, wherein they mu&s;t be, in all Probability, for ever deprived of &s;o eminent an In&s;trument of their Comfort and Edifica|tion; but e&s;pecially, that by his Departure, they &s;hould lo&s;e &s;uch a bright Re&s;emblance of God's moral Perfections, and &s;hining Example of every Chri&s;tian Grace and Virtue, which had in it the Force and
<PB N="4" REF="007695_0007_102D9B04D5E3D220">
Power of all other Motives, to excite them to Imita|tion: This, ah! This, was what did rend their Hearts with Grief, and filled their Eyes with Tears.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, the&s;e Words teach us the en|dearing mutual Love of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Di&s;ciples, one to|wards another; and e&s;pecially to their &s;piritual Guides and Teachers: Yet that there is no Relation, in Life, &s;o near and dear, but mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved, and a dark de|parting Hour mu&s;t come; and &s;uch is the imperfect State of the mo&s;t &s;anctify'd Chri&s;tian in this Life, that it would be next Door to impo&s;&s;ible to ex|clude every Degree of un&s;uitable Dependence on Mini&s;ters, or inordinate Affections towards them; and no Doubt at Paul's Departure, there was &s;ome Exce&s;s, in the Di&s;ciples Mourning.&mdash;</P>
<P>From the Words, in this View of them, we may infer the&s;e three Propo&s;itions, as the Subject of the following Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That there is a very peculiar Love and Affection that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the true Di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t&punc;</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That the deare&s;t Chri&s;tian Friends &s;hould &s;o live to|gether and conduct towards one another, as that when they are called to a Seperation, they may depart in Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That God's People are liable to have too great a Dependence upon &s;uch as faithfully labour for their &s;pi|ritual and eternal Benefit.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. Prop. <HI>That there is a very peculiar Love and en|dearing Affection &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the true Di&s;ciples of</HI> JESUS-CHRIST.</P>
<P>Love &s;o much enters into both the Character and Temper of the true Chri&s;tian, that the divine Author of this holy Religion makes it the Criterion of Sin|cerity, and di&s;criminating Badge of his guilele&s;s Fol|lowers. It is the only convincing vi&s;ible Evidence of Di&s;ciple&s;hip; <HI>John</HI> 13, 35. <HI>By this &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another:</HI> And it is a &s;atisfying internal Evidence to every Believer's own Heart, i. <HI>John</HI> 3, 14. <HI>We know that we have pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="007695_0008_102D9B07565F6AC0">
from Death unto Life, becau&s;e we love the Brethren.</HI> Love is an e&s;&s;ential Branch of the Religion <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> taught, and a mo&s;t important Duty which he has, both by his indi&s;putable Authority and bright Exam|ple, enjoin'd. How often does he repeat it! How pre&s;&s;ingly in&s;i&s;t upon it! And with what powerful Motives does he inculcate it upon the Minds of his Di&s;ciples! <HI>John</HI> xiii, 12.xv, 34.&mdash;And how full are the Apo&s;tolick Writings of the mo&s;t cogent Ar|guments and Incentives to this God-like Principle! 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 4.9. <HI>But as touching brotherly Love, ye need not that I write unto you, for ye your&s;elves are taught of GOD, to love one another.&mdash;Let brotherly Love continue&mdash;above all Things have fervent Charity.&mdash;If we have not Charity, we are Nothing.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>One great De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel, is, to train Men up, meeten, and qualify them for the Fruitions and Employments of the heavenly State; to beget in them a Reli&s;h for, and a Temper &s;uited to that Kind of Felicity, that Heaven con&s;i&s;ts in; which is perfect Love, eternal Peace, and univer&s;al Harmony. No contrary Intere&s;ts, no jarring Lu&s;ts, no unruly Pa&s;|&s;ions, or inordinate Affections, &s;hall ever enter or &s;ub&s;i&s;t there; but perfect Love will for ever reign.&mdash;</P>
<P>This divine Propen&s;ity is the fir&s;t Principle of all holy living, the very Root of all Conformity to the preceptive Will of God. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who <HI>&s;pake as never Man &s;pake;</HI> and <HI>taught as One having Au|thority,</HI> plainly declares, that Love to God and our Neighbour, are the two grand Topicks, or impor|tant Commands, in which all, both the Law and the Prophets, are comprehended: And the Apo&s;tle makes Love, as it were, the Comprehen&s;ion of all Reli|gion; when he &s;ays, <HI>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</HI> Nor is there any Thing, wherein the Chri&s;tian can more re&s;emble the ble&s;&s;ed God, than in This. Hence he &s;ays, <HI>He that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, for God is Love.</HI> Love, therefore, is that divine Principle which &s;overeign Grace implants in the Soul. The Face
<PB N="6" REF="007695_0009_102D7254E5CC8380">
of Things veil'd with any Degree of Darkne&s;s, may be brightened and illu&s;trated by their Oppo&s;ites, and judged by their Contraries: So here,&mdash;If we find a malevolent Temper, or Ill-Will towards our Bre|thren and Fellow-Men, e&s;pecially if it ari&s;es from tho&s;e very Motives on which we ought to love them; it is a &s;ad Sign that we are de&s;titute of a gracious Princi|ple at Heart.&mdash;All Malice, Strife, Envy and Ha|tred, are diametrically oppo&s;ite to the true Temper of a real Chri&s;tian. It is the peculiar Property of the Chri&s;tian, to have <HI>the &s;ame Mind,</HI> Temper or Di&s;po&s;i|tion, <HI>in him, which was in</HI> Je&s;us-Chri&s;t. <HI>He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit,</HI> like minded with <HI>Chri&s;t; that is,</HI> he loves what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> loves, and hates what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hates; upon the &s;ame Motives. He that is begotten of GOD, and &s;o is made truly gracious; &s;o far as he is renewed and &s;anctified, re&s;embles his heavenly Father; and in nothing more than in Love. All <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Di&s;ciples are in Love with, and bear a Re&s;emblance of the &s;ame infinitely amiable Object; therefore it is the Image of God, which the Saint &s;ees in his Brother; which is the Ground of his brotherly Love and Chri&s;tian Charity. <HI>He that loveth Him who begets, loveth Him al&s;o, who is begotten of Him</HI>; and that, on the Account of the&s;e amiable Qualities, wherein he &s;ees him to re&s;emble his hea|venly Father: The divine Image di&s;cern'd in Chri|&s;tians, mu&s;t, and cannot but attract every Heart that loves GOD &s;upremely. The &s;ame Rea&s;ons hold for our Love to the Brethren, as for our Love to GOD; though not in the &s;ame Degree: GOD is in|finitely, and ab&s;olutely amiable in him&s;elf; and the Saint is derivatively amiable, and therefore to be loved; not for him&s;elf, but for his Father's Sake, and in Proportion to that Degree of Likene&s;s he bears to him.&mdash;by the Way&mdash;</P>
<P>Hence we may &s;ee, how much it concerns &s;uch as would be e&s;teemed as Saints, and held in Charity; to act out and exhibit a divine Temper in all their Con|duct.
<PB N="7" REF="007695_0010_102D9B0BEF5E5F90">
Your Brother cannot &s;ee your Heart, other|wi&s;e than as your Life, Conduct and Conver&s;ation mu&s;t be taken as an Index of the inward Frame and Temper of your Mind.&mdash;In vain therefore, do loo&s;e, frothy, carnal, carele&s;s Profe&s;&s;ors claim the Charity of the People of GOD.&mdash;In a Word,</P>
<P>How can it be but that &s;uch an endearing tender Love, &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t among all <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Di&s;ciples, one towards another; &s;eeing they are Children of the &s;ame Father, Branches of the &s;ame Family, Mem|bers of the &s;ame Body, fighting under the &s;ame glo|rious Captain, all engaged in the &s;ame Intere&s;t, fed at the &s;ame Table, led by the &s;ame Spirit, initiated into the &s;ame Priviledges, travelling in the &s;ame Way, running the &s;ame Race, and Heirs of the &s;ame Inheritance; nay enrolled Citizens of the &s;ame new <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> where they all hope, ere long, to meet in one great and general A&s;&s;embly, to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, each for him&s;elf, of a Crown and King|dom, dwell for ever together in Fulne&s;s of Joy, bow before the Throne, and with all their Hearts and Tongues join in one eternal Song of Prai&s;e: A&s;crib|ing Glory and Honour, Thanksgiving, and Ble&s;&s;ing to God, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.&mdash;</P>

<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="007695_0011_102D9B0E0D24D288">1. That divine Providence may call Them to part, tho' they be continued in Life, and &s;o in a State of Probation. This is &s;o much our own pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, that no other In&s;tance need be introduced for Illu&s;tra|tion. I am by an all-di&s;po&s;ing Providence, called, &s;o far as I am capable of judging in the Ca&s;e, to part with my reverend and greatly e&s;teemed Brethren, my beloved People and dear Family; and were it not that I fear le&s;t I &s;hould be found to counteract infi|nite Wi&s;dom in it's providential Conduct; my &s;trong Affections to Tho&s;e I leave behind, in the various Re|lations of Life, mu&s;t have preponderated all other Rea&s;ons, determined my Continuance, and &s;o pre|vented my pre&s;ent De&s;ign. The Scene, which is ju&s;t now opening to me, and the Province I am ready to enter upon, I can mo&s;t freely &s;ay is what I never have either coveted or &s;ought after; and as I have not, my dear People, look'd upon your generous and &s;elf-denying Con&s;ent to my leaving you, in Or|der to &s;erve the publick Intere&s;t, as any Argument at all of your Want of &s;uitable Affections to your Mini&s;ter; but as the genuine Fruit of a truly gene|rous and publick Spirit; &s;o I hope you will not en|tertain my Departure (with your own manife&s;t Con|&s;ent) as ari&s;ing from any Want of Love to you, or of real and tender Regard for your Good; for it is the common Cau&s;e that I am &s;till going to plead, and (as far as I &s;hall thro' Grace be enabled) to pro|mote.&mdash;As I do not entertain the lea&s;t Doubt of your Affections towards me, even far beyond my De&s;erv|ing; &s;o I am very con&s;cious of my own tender Re|gard to you, and hearty Concern for your Pro&s;perity and Welfare in all your Intere&s;ts.
