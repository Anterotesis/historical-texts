<HEAD>CHAP. I. The de&s;cription of the family of Wakefield; in which a kindred likene&s;s prevails as well of minds as of per|&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS ever of opinion that the hone&s;t man who married and brought up a large family, did more &s;er|vice than he who continued &s;ingle, and only talked of population. From this motive, I had &s;carce taken or|ders a year, before I began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of matri|mony, cho&s;e my wife as &s;he did her wedding gown, not for a fine glo&s;&s;y &s;urface, but &s;uch qualities as would wear well. To do her ju&s;tice, &s;he was a good natured notable woman: and as for breeding, there were few country ladies who at that time could &s;hew more. She could read any Engli&s;h book without much &s;pelling, and for pickling, pre&s;erving, and cookery, none could excel her. She prided her&s;elf much al&s;o upon being an excel|lent contriver in hou&s;e-keeping; yet I cou'd never find that we grew richer with all her contrivances.</P>
<P>However, we loved each other tenderly, and our fondne&s;s encrea&s;ed with age. There was in fact nothing that could make us angry with the world or each other. We had an elegant hou&s;e, &s;ituated in a fine country, and a good neighbourhood. The year was &s;pent in moral or rural amu&s;ements; in vi&s;iting our rich neighbours, or relieving &s;uch as were poor. We had no revolutions to fear, nor fatigues to undergo; all our adventures were by the fire-&s;ide, and all our migrations from the blue bed to the brown.</P>
<P>As we lived near the road, we often had the traveller or &s;tranger come to ta&s;te our goo&s;eberry wine, for which we had great reputation; and I profe&s;s with the veracity of an hi&s;torian, that I never knew one of them find fault with it. Our cou&s;ins too even to the fortieth remove,
<PB N="6" REF="012405_0005_0F89729BB2DF0A70">
all remembred their affinity, without any help from the Herald's office, and came very frequently to &s;ee us. Some of them did us no great honour by the&s;e claims of kindred; for literally &s;peaking we had the blind, the maimed, and halt among&s;t the number. However, my wife always in&s;i&s;ted that as they were the &s;ame <HI>fle&s;h and blood,</HI> with us, they &s;hould &s;it with us at the &s;ame table. So that if we had not very rich, we generally had very happy friends about us; for this remark will hold good thro' life, that the poorer the gue&s;t, the better plea&s;ed he ever is with being treated: and as &s;ome men gaze with admiration at the colours of a tulip, and others are &s;mitten with the wings of a butterfly, &s;o I was by nature an admirer of happy human faces. However, when any one of our relations was found to be a per&s;on of very bad character, a trouble&s;ome gue&s;t, or one we de&s;ired to get rid of, upon his leaving my hou&s;e for the fir&s;t time, I ever took care to lend him a riding coat, or a pair of boots, or &s;ometimes an hor&s;e of &s;mall value, and I al|ways had the &s;ati&s;faction of finding he never came back to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them. By this the hou&s;e was cleared of &s;uch as we did not like; but never was the family of Wake|field known to turn the traveller or the poor dependant out of doors.</P>
<P>Thus we lived &s;everal years in a &s;tate of much happi|ne&s;s, not but that we &s;ometimes had tho&s;e little rubs which Providence &s;ends to enhance the value of its fa|vours. My orchard was often robbed by &s;chool-boys, and my wife's cu&s;tards plundered by the cats or the chil|dren. The 'Squire would &s;ometimes fall a&s;leep in the mo&s;t pathetic parts of my &s;ermon, or his lady return my wife's civilities at church with a mutilated curte&s;y. But we &s;oon got over the unea&s;ine&s;s cau&s;ed by &s;uch accidents, and u&s;ually in three or four days we began to wonder how they vext us.</P>
<P>My children, the offspring of temperance, as they were educated without &s;oftne&s;s, &s;o they were at once well formed and healthy; my &s;ons hardy and active, my daughters dutiful and blooming. When I &s;tood in the mid&s;t of the little circle which promi&s;ed to be the &s;up|ports of my declining age, I could not avoid repeating the famous &s;tory of Count Aben&s;berg, who, in Henry
<PB N="7" REF="012405_0006_0F89729C771AA8B0">
II's progre&s;s through Germany, when other courtiers came with their trea&s;ures, brought his thirty two chil|dren and pre&s;ented them to his &s;overeign as the mo&s;t va|luable offering he had to be&s;tow. In this manner, though I had but &s;ix, I con&s;idered them as a very valuable pre|&s;ent made to my country, and con&s;equently looked upon it as my debtor. Our elde&s;t &s;on was named George, af|ter his uncle, who left us ten thou&s;and pounds. Our &s;econd child, a girl, I intended to call after her aunt Gri&s;&s;el; but my wife, who during her pregnancy had been reading romances, in&s;i&s;ted upon her being called Olivia. In le&s;s than another year we had a daughter again, and now I was determined that Gri&s;&s;el &s;hould be her name; but a rich relation taking a fancy to &s;tand godmother, the girl was, by her directions, called So|phia; &s;o that we had two romantic names in the family; but I &s;olemnly prote&s;t I had no hand in it. Mo&s;es was our next, and after an interval of twelve years, we had two &s;ons more.</P>
<P>It would be fruitle&s;s to deny my exultation when I &s;aw my little ones about me; but the vanity and the &s;atisfac|tion of my wife were even greater than mine. When our vi&s;itors would u&s;ually &s;ay,
<Q>Well, upon my word, Mrs. Primro&s;e, you have the fine&s;t children in the whole country.</Q>
&mdash;"Ay, neighbour," &s;he would an&s;wer,
<Q>they are as heaven made them, hand&s;ome enough, if they be good, enough; for hand&s;ome is that hand&s;ome does.</Q> And then &s;he would bid the girls hold up their heads; who, to conceal nothing, were certainly very hand&s;ome. Mere out&s;ide is &s;o very trifling a circum&s;tance with me, that I &s;hould &s;carce have re|membered to mention it, had it not been a general topic of conver&s;ation in the country. Olivia, now about eighteen, had that luxuriancy of beauty with which painters have generally drawn Hebe; open, &s;prightly, and commanding. Sophia's features were not &s;o &s;triking at fir&s;t; but often did more certain execution; for they were &s;oft, mode&s;t, and alluring. The one vanqui&s;hed by a &s;ingle blow, the other by efforts &s;ucce&s;&s;ively re|peated.</P>
<P>The temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn of her features, at lea&s;t it was &s;o with my daughters.
<PB N="8" REF="012405_0007_0F89729D32165B70">
Olivia wi&s;hed for many lovers, Sophia to &s;ecure one. Olivia was often affected from too great a de&s;ire to plea&s;e. Sophia even repre&s;t excellence from her &s;ears to offend. The one entertained me with her vivacity when I was gay, the other with her &s;en&s;e when I was &s;erious. But the&s;e qualities were never carried to exce&s;s in either, and I have often &s;een them exchange characters for a whole day together. A &s;uit of mourning has transform|ed my coquet into a prude, and a new &s;et of ribbands given her younger &s;i&s;ter more than natural vivacity. My elde&s;t &s;on George was bred at Oxford, as I intended him for one of the learned profe&s;&s;ions. My &s;econd boy Mo|&s;es, whom I de&s;igned for bu&s;ine&s;s, received a &s;ort of mi&s;cellaneous education at home. But it would be needle&s;s to attempt de&s;cribing the particular characters of young people that had &s;een but very little of the world. In &s;hort, a family likene&s;s prevailed through all, and, properly &s;peaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, &s;imple, and inof|fen&s;ive.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Family misfortunes. The lo&s;s of fortune only &s;erves to encrea&s;e the pride of the worthy.</HEAD>
<P>THE temporal concerns of our family were chiefly committed to my wife's management, as to the &s;piritual, I took them entirely under my own direction. The profits of my living, which amounted to but thirty- five pounds a year, I gave to the orphans and widows of the clergy of our dioce&s;e; for having a &s;ufficient fortune of my own, I was carele&s;s of temporalities, and felt a &s;ecret plea&s;ure in doing my duty without reward. I al&s;o &s;et a re&s;olution of keeping no cura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and of being ac|quainted with every man in the pari&s;h, exhorting the married men to temperance, and the batchelors to ma|trimony? &s;o that in a few years it was a common &s;aying, that there were three &s;trange wants at Wakefield, a par|&s;on
<PB N="9" REF="012405_0008_0F89729EB9765B90">
wanting pride, young men wanting wives, and ale-hou&s;es wanting cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>Matrimony was always one of my favourite topics, and I wrote &s;everal &s;ermons to prove its utility and hap|pine&s;s: but there was a peculiar tenet which I made a point of &s;upporting; for I maintained with Whi&s;ton, that it was unlawful for a prie&s;t of the church of England, after the death of his fir&s;t wife, to take a &s;econd, or, to expre&s;s it in one word, I valued my&s;elf upon being a &s;trict monogami&s;t.</P>
<P>I was early initiated into this important di&s;pute, on which &s;o many laborious volumes have been written. I publi&s;hed &s;ome tracts upon the &s;ubject my&s;elf, which, as they never &s;old, I have the con&s;olation of thinking are read only by the happy <HI>Few.</HI> Some of my friends called this my weak &s;ide; but alas! they had not like me made it the &s;ubject of long contemplation. The more I reflected upon it, the more important it appeared. I even went a &s;tep beyond Whi&s;ton in di&s;playing my principles: as he had en|graven upon his wife's tomb, that &s;he was the <HI>only</HI> wife of William Whi&s;ton; &s;o I wrote a &s;imilar epitaph for my wife, tho' &s;till living, in which I extolled her prudence, oeconomy and obedience till death; and having got it copied fair, with an elegant frame, it was placed over the chimney-piece, where it an&s;wered &s;everal very u&s;eful purpo&s;es. It admoni&s;hed my wife of her duty to me, and my fideli|ty to her; it in&s;pired her with a pa&s;&s;ion for fame, and con&s;tantly put her in mind of her end.</P>
<P>It was thus, perhaps, from hearing marriage &s;o often recommended, that my elde&s;t &s;on, ju&s;t upon leaving college, fixed his affections upon the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman, who was a dignitary in the church, and in circum&s;tances to give her a large fortune: but fortune was her &s;malle&s;t accompli&s;hment. Mi&s;s Arabella Wil|mot was allowed of all, except my two daughters, to be completely pretty. Her youth, health, and innocence, were &s;till heightened by a complexion &s;o tran&s;parent, and &s;uch an happy &s;en&s;ibility of look, that even age could not gaze with indifference. As Mr. Wilmot knew that I could make a very hand&s;ome &s;ettlement on my &s;on, he was not aver&s;e to the match; &s;o both families lived to|gether in all that harmony which generally precedes an
<PB N="10" REF="012405_0009_0F89729FC00668A0">
expected alliance. Being convinced by experience that the days of court&s;hip are the mo&s;t happy of our lives, I was willing enough to lengthen the period; and the va|rious amu&s;ements which the young couple every day &s;hared in each other's company, &s;eemed to encrea&s;e their pa&s;&s;ion. We were generally awakened in the morning by mu&s;ic, and on fine days rode a hunting. The hours be|tween breakfa&s;t and dinner, the ladies devoted to dre&s;s and &s;tudy: they u&s;ually read a page, and then gazed at them&s;elves in the gla&s;s, which even philo&s;ophers might own, often pre&s;ented the page of greate&s;t beauty. At dinner my wife took the lead; for as &s;he always in&s;i&s;t|ed upon carving every thing her&s;elf, it being her mother's way, &s;he gave us upon the&s;e occa&s;ions the hi&s;tory of eve|ry di&s;h. When we had dined, to prevent the ladies leaving us, I generally ordered the table to be removed; and &s;ometimes, with the mu&s;ic ma&s;ter's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the girls would give us a very agreeable concert. Walk|ing out, drinking tea, country dances, and forfeits, &s;hortened the re&s;t of the day, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cards, as I hated all manner of gaming, except back|gammon, at which my old friend and I &s;ometimes took a two-penny hit. Nor can I here pa&s;s over an ominous circum&s;tance that happened the la&s;t time we played toge|ther. I only wanted to fling a quatre, and yet I threw deuce ace five times running.</P>
<P>Some months were elap&s;ed in this manner, till at la&s;t it was thought convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young couple, who &s;eemed earne&s;tly to de&s;ire it. During the preparations for the wedding, I need not de|&s;cribe the bu&s;y importance of my wife, nor the &s;ly looks of my daughters: in fact, my attention was fixed on another object, the completing a tract which I intended &s;hortly to publi&s;h in defence of monogamy. As I looked upon this as a ma&s;ter piece both for argument and &s;tyle, I could not in the pride of my heart avoid &s;hewing it to my old friend Mr. Wilmot, as I made no doubt of re|ceiving his approbation: but too late I di&s;covered that he was mo&s;t violently attached to the contrary opinion, and with good rea&s;on; for he was at that time actually courting a fourth wife. This, as may be expected, pro|duced a di&s;pute attended with &s;ome acrimony, which
<PB N="11" REF="012405_0010_0F8972A0357739B0">
threatened to interrupt our intended alliance: but on the day before that appointed for the ceremony, we agreed to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubject at large.</P>
<P>It was managed with proper &s;pirit on both &s;ides: he a&s;&s;erted that I was heterodox. I retorted the charge: he replied, and I rejoined. In the mean time, while the controver&s;y was hotte&s;t, I was called out by one of my relations, who, with a face of concern, advi&s;ed me to give up the di&s;pute, and allow the old gentlemen to be a hu&s;band, if he could, at lea&s;t till my &s;on's wedding was over. "How," cried I,
<Q>relinqui&s;h the cau&s;e of truth, and let him be an hu&s;band, already driven to the very verge of ab&s;urdity. You might as well ad|vi&s;e me to give up my fortune as my argument.</Q> "That fortune," returned my friend,
<Q>I am now &s;or|ry to inform you is almo&s;t nothing. Your merchant in town, in who&s;e hands your money was lodged, has gone off, to avoid a &s;tatute of bankruptcy, and it is thought has not left a &s;hilling in the pound. I was unwilling to &s;hock you or the family with the account till after the wedding: but now it may &s;erve to mode|rate your warmth in the argument; for, I &s;uppo&s;e, your own prudence will enforce the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;|&s;embling, at lea&s;t, till your &s;on has the young lady's fortune &s;ecured.</Q>
&mdash;"Well," returned I,
<Q>if what you tell me be true, and if I am to be a beggar, it &s;hall never make me a ra&s;cal, or induce me to di&s;avow my principles. I'll go this moment and inform the company of my circum&s;tances; and as for the argu|ment, I even here retract my former conce&s;&s;ions in the old gentleman's favour, nor will I allow him now to be an hu&s;band either de jure, de facto, or in any &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to de&s;cribe the different &s;en&s;ations of both families when I divulged the news of my misfor|tunes; but what others felt was &s;light to what the young lovers appeared to endure. Mr. Wilmot, who &s;eemed before &s;ufficiently inclined to break off the match, was by this blow &s;oon determined: one virtue he had in per|fection, which was prudence, too often the only virtue that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> left us unimpaired at &s;eventy-two.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A migration. The fortunate circum&s;tances of our lives are generally found at la&s;t to be of our own pro|curing.</HEAD>
<P>THE only hope of our family now was, that the report of our mi&s;fortunes might be malicious or premature: but a letter from my agent in town &s;oon came with a confirmation of every particular. The lo&s;s of fortune to my&s;elf alone would have been trifling; the only unea&s;ine&s;s I felt, was for my family, who were to be humble without &s;uch an education as could render them callous to contempt.</P>
<P>Near a fortnight pa&s;&s;ed away before I attempted to re&s;train their affliction; for premature con&s;olation is but the remembrance of &s;orrow. During this interval my thoughts were employed on &s;ome future means of &s;up|porting them; and at la&s;t a &s;mall Cure of fifteen pounds a year was offered me in a di&s;tant neighbourhood, where I could &s;till enjoy my principles without mole&s;tation. With this propo&s;al I joyfully clo&s;ed, having determined to encrea&s;e my &s;alary by managing a little farm.</P>
<P>Having taken this re&s;olution, my next care was to get together the wrecks of my fortune; and all debts col|lected and paid, out of fourteen thou&s;and pounds we had now but four hundred remaining. My chief attention therefore, was next to bring down the pride of my fami|ly to their circum&s;tances; for I well knew that a&s;piring beggary is wretchedne&s;s it&s;elf.
<Q>You can't be igno|rant, my children,</Q>
cried I,
<Q>that no prudence of ours could have prevented our late misfortune; but prudence may do much in di&s;appointing its effects. We are now poor, my fondlings, and wi&s;dom bids us conform to our humble &s;ituation. Let us then, with|out repining, give up the&s;e &s;plendours with which numbers are wretched, and &s;eek in humbler circum|&s;tances that peace with which all may be happy. The poor live plea&s;antly without our help, and we are not &s;o imperfectly formed as to be incapable o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="13" REF="012405_0012_0F8972A1B3A8A3D0">
living without theirs. No, my children, let us from this moment give up all preten&s;ions to gentility; we have &s;till enough left for happine&s;s, if we are wi&s;e, and let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune.</Q></P>
<P>As my elde&s;t &s;on was bred a &s;cholar, I determined to &s;end him to town, where his abilities might contribute to our &s;upport and his own. The &s;eparation of friends and families is, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful cir|cum&s;tances attendant on penury. The day &s;oon arrived on which we were to di&s;per&s;e for the fir&s;t time. My &s;on, after taking leave of his mother and the re&s;t, who ming|led their tears with their ki&s;&s;es, came to a&s;k a ble&s;&s;ing from me. This I gave him from my heart, and which, added to five guineas, was all the patrimony I had now to be&s;tow. "You are going, my boy," cried I,
<Q>to London on foot, in the manner Hooker, your great ance&s;tor, travelled there before you. Take from me the &s;ame hor&s;e that was given him by the good bi&s;hop Jewel, this &s;taff, and take this book too, it will be your comfort on the way: the&s;e two lines in it are worth a million, <HI>I have been young, and now am old; yet never &s;aw I the righteous man for&s;aken, or his &s;eed beg|ging their bread.</HI> Let this be your con&s;olation as you travel on. Go, my boy, whatever be thy fortune let me &s;ee thee once a year; &s;till keep a good heart, and farewell.</Q>
As he was po&s;&s;e&s;t of integrity and honour, I was under no apprehen&s;ions from throwing him naked into the amphitheatre of life; for I knew he would act a good part whether he ro&s;e or fell.</P>
<P>His departure only prepared the way for our own, which arrived a few days afterwards. The leaving a neighbourhood in which we had enjoyed &s;o many hours of tranquillity, was not without a tear, which &s;carce for|titude it&s;elf could &s;uppre&s;s. Be&s;ides, a journey of &s;even|ty miles to a family that had hitherto never been above ten from home, filled us with apprehen&s;ion, and the cries of the poor, who followed us for &s;ome miles, contributed to encrea&s;e it. The fir&s;t day's journey brought us in &s;afety within thirty miles of our future retreat, and we put up for the night at an ob&s;cure inn in a village by the way. When we were &s;hewn a room, I de&s;ired the land|lord,
<PB N="14" REF="012405_0013_0F8972A272F11B70">
in my u&s;ual way, to let us have his company, with which he complied, as what he drank would encrea&s;e the bill next morning. He knew, however, the whole neighbourhood to which I was removing, particularly 'Squire Thornhill, who was to be my landlord, and who lived within a few miles of the place. This gentleman he de&s;cribed, as one who de&s;ired to know little more of the world than the plea&s;ures it afforded, being particu|larly remarkable for his attachment to the fair &s;ex. He ob&s;erved that no virtue was able to re&s;i&s;t his arts and a&s;&s;i|duity, and that &s;carce a farmer's daughter within ten miles round, but what had found him &s;ucce&s;sful and faithle&s;s. Though this account gave me &s;ome pain, it had a very different effect upon my daughters, who&s;e features &s;eemed to brighten with the expectation of an approaching triumph, nor was my wife le&s;s plea&s;ed and confident of their allurements and virtue. While our thoughts were thus employed, the ho&s;te&s;s entered the room to inform her hu&s;band that the &s;trange gentleman, who had been two days in the hou&s;e, wanted money, and could not &s;atisfy them for his reckoning.
<Q>Want mo|ney!</Q>
replied the ho&s;t,
<Q>that mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible; for it was no later than ye&s;terday he paid three gui|neas to our beadle to &s;pare an old broken &s;oldier that was to be whipped through the town for dog-&s;teal|ing.</Q> The ho&s;te&s;s, however, &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in her fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, he was preparing to leave the room, &s;wear|ing that he would be &s;atisfied one way or another, when I begged the landlord would introduce me to a &s;tranger of &s;o much charity as he de&s;cribed. With this he com|plied, &s;hewing in a gentleman who &s;eemed to be about thirty, dre&s;t in cloaths that once were laced. His per|&s;on was well formed, though his face was marked with the lines of thinking. He had &s;omething &s;hort and dry in his addre&s;s, and &s;eemed not to under&s;tand ceremony, or to de&s;pi&s;e it. Upon the landlord's leaving the room, I could not avoid expre&s;&s;ing my concern to the &s;tranger, at &s;eeing a gentleman in &s;uch circum&s;tances, and offered him my pur&s;e to &s;atisfy the pre&s;ent demand.
<Q>I take it with all my heart, Sir,</Q>
replied he,
<Q>and am glad that a late over&s;ight in giving what money I had about me, has &s;hewn me that there is &s;till &s;ome benevolence
<PB N="15" REF="012405_0014_0F8972A333F82748">
left among us. I mu&s;t, however, previou&s;ly entreat being informed of the name and re&s;idence of my bene|factor, in order to remit it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</Q>
In this I &s;atisfied him fully, not only mentioning my name and late misfortunes, but the place to which I was going to remove. "This" cried he,
<Q>happens &s;till more luckily than I hoped for, as I am going the &s;ame way my&s;elf, having been detained here two days by the floods, which, I hope, by to morrow will be found pa&s;&s;able.</Q>
I te&s;tified the plea&s;ure I &s;hould have in his company, and my wife and daughters joining in entreaty, he was prevailed upon to &s;tay to &s;upper. The &s;tranger's conver&s;ation, which was at once plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive induced me to wi&s;h for a continuance of it; but it was now high time to retire and take refre&s;hment again&s;t the fatigues of the following day.</P>
<P>The next morning we all &s;et forward together: my family on hor&s;eback, while Mr. Burchel, our new com|panion, walked along the foot-path by the road-&s;ide, ob&s;erving, with a &s;mile, that as we were ill mounted, he would be too generous to attempt leaving us behind. As the floods were not yet &s;ub&s;ided, we were obliged to hire a guide, who trotted on before, Mr. Burchel and I bringing up the rear. We lightened the fatigues of the road with philo&s;ophical di&s;putes, which he &s;eemed per|fectly to under&s;tand. But what &s;urpri&s;ed me mo&s;t was, that though he was a money borrower, he defended his opinions with as much ob&s;tinacy as if he had been my patron. He now and then al&s;o informed me to whom the different &s;eats belonged that lay in our view, as we travelled the road. "That," cried he, pointing to a very magnificent hou&s;e which &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance,
<Q>belongs to Mr. Thornhill, a young gentleman who enjoys a large fortune, though entirely dependant on the will of his uncle, Sir William Thornhill, a gentle|man, who content with a little him&s;elf, permits his nephew to enjoy the re&s;t, and chiefly re&s;ides in town.</Q>
"What!" cried I,
<Q>is my young landlord then the ne|phew of a man who&s;e virtues, genero&s;ity, and &s;ingu|larities are &s;o univer&s;ally known? I have heard Sir William Thornhill repre&s;ented as one of the mo&s;t ge|nerous, yet whim&s;ical, men in the kingdom; a man
<PB N="16" REF="012405_0015_0F8972A3F2D79830">
of con&s;ummate benevolence.</Q>
&mdash;Something, per|haps, too much &s;o, replied Mr. Burchel,
<Q>at lea&s;t he carried benevolence to an exce&s;s when young; for his pa&s;&s;ions were then &s;trong, and as they all were upon the &s;ide of virtue, they led it up to a romantic ex|treme. He early began to aim at the qualifications of the &s;oldier and &s;cholar; was &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed in the army, and had &s;ome reputation among men of learn|ing. Adulation ever follows the ambitious; for &s;uch alone receive mo&s;t plea&s;ure from flattery. He was &s;urrounded with crowds, who &s;hewed him only one &s;ide of their character; &s;o that he began to lo&s;e a re|gard for private intere&s;t in univer&s;al &s;ympathy. He loved all mankind; for fortune prevented him from knowing that there were ra&s;cals. Phy&s;icians tell us of a di&s;order in which the whole body is &s;o exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible, that the &s;lighte&s;t touch gives pain: what &s;ome have thus &s;uffered in their per&s;ons, this gentleman felt in his mind. The &s;lighte&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, whether real or fictitious, touched him to the quick, and his &s;oul la|boured under a fickle &s;en&s;ibility of the mi&s;eries of o|thers. Thus di&s;po&s;ed to relieve, it will be ea&s;ily con|jectured, he found numbers di&s;po&s;ed to &s;olicit: his profu&s;ions began to impair his fortune, but not his good-nature; that, indeed, was &s;een to encrea&s;e as the other &s;eemed to decay; he grew improvident as he grew poor; and though he talked like a man of &s;en&s;e, his actions were tho&s;e of a fool. Still, how|ever, being &s;urrounded with importunity, and no longer able to &s;atisfy every reque&s;t that was made him, in&s;tead of <HI>money</HI> he gave <HI>promi&s;es.</HI> They were all he had to be&s;tow, and he had not re&s;olution enough to give any man pain by a denial. By this means he drew round him crowds of dependants, whom he was &s;ure to di&s;appoint; yet wi&s;hed to relieve. The&s;e hung upon him for a time, and left him with merited reproaches and contempt. But in proportion as he became contemptible to others, he became de&s;picable to him&s;elf. His mind had leaned upon their adulation, and that &s;upport taken away, he could find no plea&s;ure in the applau&s;e of his heart, which he had never learnt to reverence it&s;elf. The world now began to wear
<PB N="17" REF="012405_0016_0F8972A4B56B2FA8">
a different a&s;pect; the flattery of his friends began to dwindle into &s;imple approbation, that &s;oon took the more friendly form of advice, and advice when re|jected ever begets reproaches. He now found that &s;uch friends as benefits hath gathered round him were by no means the mo&s;t e&s;timable: it was now found that a man's own heart mu&s;t be ever given to gain that of another. I now found, that&mdash;but I forget what I was going to ob&s;erve: in &s;hort, Sir, he re&s;olved to re&s;pect him&s;elf, and laid down a plan of re&s;toring his &s;hattered fortune. For this purpo&s;e, in his own whim&s;ical manner he travelled through Europe on foot, and before he attained the age of thirty, his circum&s;tances were more affluent than ever. At pre|&s;ent, therefore, his bounties are more rational and moderate than before; but &s;till he pre&s;erves the cha|racter of an humouri&s;t, and finds mo&s;t plea&s;ure in ec|centric virtues.</Q></P>
<P>My attention was &s;o much taken up by Mr. Burchel's account, that I &s;carce looked forward as we went along, till we were alarmed by the cries of my family, when turning. I perceived my younge&s;t daughter in the mid&s;t of a rapid &s;tream, thrown from her hor&s;e, and &s;trug|gling with the torrent. She had &s;unk twice, nor was it in my power to di&s;engage my&s;elf in time to bring her relief. My &s;en&s;ations were even too violent to permit my attempting her re&s;cue; &s;he would have certainly peri&s;hed had not my companion, perceiving her danger, in&s;tantly plunged in to her relief, and, with &s;ome difficulty, brought her in &s;afety to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. By taking the current a little farther up; the re&s;t of the family got &s;afely over; where we had an opportunity of joining our acknowledgments to her's. Her gratitude may be more readily imagined than de&s;cribed: &s;he thanked her deli|verer more with looks than words, and continued to lean upon his arm, as if &s;till willing to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance. My wife al&s;o hoped one day to have the plea&s;ure of re|turning his kindne&s;s at her own hou&s;e. Thus, after we were all refre&s;hed at the next inn, and had dined to|gether, as he was going to a different part of the coun|try, he took leave; and we pur&s;ued our journey. My wife ob&s;erving as we went, that &s;he liked Mr. Burchel
<PB N="18" REF="012405_0017_0F8972A573919578">
extremely, and prote&s;ting, that if he had birth and for|tune to entitle him to match into &s;uch a family as our's, &s;he knew no man &s;he would &s;ooner fix upon. I could not but &s;mile to hear her talk in this &s;train: one almo&s;t at the verge of beggary thus to a&s;&s;ume language of the mo&s;t in&s;ulting affluence, might excite the ridicule of ill- nature; but I was never much di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e in|nocent delu&s;ions that tend to make us more happy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A proof that even the humble&s;t fortune may grant hap|pine&s;s and delight which depend not on circum&s;tance, but con&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>THE place of our new retreat was in a little neighbourhood, con&s;i&s;ting of farmers, who tilled their own grounds, and were equal &s;trangers to opulence and poverty. As they had almo&s;t all the conveniences of life within them&s;elves, they &s;eldom vi&s;ited towns or cities in &s;earch of &s;uperfluity. Remote from the polite, they &s;till retained a primaeval &s;implicity of manners, and frugal by long habit, &s;carce knew that temperance was a virtue. They wrought with chearfulne&s;s on days of la|bour; but ob&s;erved fe&s;tivals as intervals of idlene&s;s and plea&s;ure. They kept up the Chri&s;tmas carol, &s;ent true love-knots on Valentine morning, eat pancakes on Shrove-tide, &s;hewed their wit on the fir&s;t of April, and religi|ou&s;ly cracked nuts on Allhollow eve. Being apprized of our approach, the whole neighbourhood came out to meet their mini&s;ter, dre&s;t in their fine&s;t cloaths, and preceded by a pipe and tabor: al&s;o a fea&s;t was provided for our reception, at which we &s;at chearfully down; and what the conver&s;ation wanted in wit, we made up in laugh|ter.</P>
<P>Our little habitation was &s;ituated at the foot of a &s;lo|ping hill, &s;heltered with a beautiful underwood behind, and a pratling river before; on one &s;ide a meadow, on
<PB N="19" REF="012405_0018_0F8972A6336BBA10">
the other a green. My farm con&s;i&s;ted of about twenty acres of excellent land, having given an hundred pounds for my predece&s;&s;or's good-will. Nothing could exceed the neatne&s;s of my little enclo&s;ures: the elms and hedge rows appearing with inexpre&s;&s;ible beauty. My hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of but one &s;tory, and was covered with thatch, which gave it an air of great &s;nugne&s;s: the walls on the in&s;ide were nicely white-wa&s;hed, and my daughters un|dertook to adorn them with pictures of their own de&s;ign|ing. Though the &s;ame room &s;erved us for parlour and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Be&s;ides, as it was kept with the utmo&s;t neatne&s;s, the di&s;hes, plates, and coppers, being well &s;coured, and all di&s;po&s;ed in bright rows on the &s;helves, the eye was agreeably relieved, and did not &s;eem to want rich furniture. There were three other apartments, one for my wife and me, another for our two daughters, within our own, and the third, with two beds, for the re&s;t of my children.</P>
<P>The little republic to which I gave laws, was regulat|ed in the following manner; by &s;un-ri&s;e we all a&s;&s;embled in our common apartment: the fire being previou&s;ly kindled by the &s;ervant. After we had &s;aluted each other with proper ceremony, for I always thought fit to keep up &s;ome mechanical forms of good breeding, without which, freedom ever de&s;troys friend&s;hip, we all bent in gratitude to that Being who gave us another day. This duty being performed, my &s;on and I went to pur&s;ue our u&s;ual indu&s;try, while my wife and daughters employed them&s;elves in providing breakfa&s;t, which was always rea|dy at a certain time. I allowed half an hour for this meal, and an hour for dinner; which time was taken up in innocent mirth between my wife and daughters, and in philo&s;ophical arguments between my &s;on and me.</P>
<P>As we ro&s;e with the &s;un, &s;o we never pur&s;ued our la|bours after it was gone down, but returned home to the expecting family, where &s;miling looks, a neat hearth, and plea&s;ant fire, were prepared for our reception. Nor were we without other gue&s;ts: &s;ometimes farmer Flam|borough, our talkative neighbour, and often the blind piper, would pay us a vi&s;it, and ta&s;te our goo&s;eberry wine; for the making of which we had lo&s;t neither the
<PB N="20" REF="012405_0019_0F8972A81A3E52A0">
receipt nor the reputation. The&s;e harmle&s;s people had &s;everal ways of being good company, while one played the pipes, another would &s;ing &s;ome &s;oothing ballad, Jonny Arm&s;trong's la&s;t good night, or the cruelty of Barbara Allen. The night was concluded in the manner we began the morning, my younge&s;t boys being appoint|ed to read the le&s;&s;ons of the day, and he that read loud|e&s;t, di&s;tincte&s;t, and be&s;t, was to have an halfpenny on Sunday to put in the poor's box.</P>
<P>When &s;unday came it was indeed a day of finery, which all my &s;umptuary edicts could not re&s;train. How well &s;oever I fancied my lectures again&s;t pride had con|quered the vanity of my daughters: yet I &s;till found them &s;ecretly attached to all their former finery: they &s;till loved laces, ribbands, bugles and catgut; my wife her&s;elf retained a pa&s;&s;ion for her crim&s;on padua&s;oy, be|cau&s;e I formerly happened to &s;ay it became her.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;unday in particular their behaviour &s;erved to mortify me: I had de&s;ired my girls the preceding night to be dre&s;t early the next day; for I always loved to be at church a good while before the re&s;t of the con|gregation. They punctually obeyed my directions; but when we were to a&s;&s;emble in the morning at breakfa&s;t, down came my wife and daughters, dre&s;t out in all their former &s;plendour: their hair plai&s;tered up with poma|tum, their faces patched to ta&s;te, their trains bundled up into an heap behind, and ru&s;tling at every motion. I could not help &s;miling at their vanity, particularly that of my wife, from whom I expected more di&s;cretion. In this exigence, therefore, my only re&s;ource was to order my &s;on, with an important air, to call our coach. The girls were amazed at the command; but I repeated it with more &s;olemnity than before.&mdash;
<Q>Surely, my dear, you je&s;t,</Q>
cried my wife,
<Q>we can walk it per|fectly well: we want no coach to carry us now</Q>
"You mi&s;take, child," returned I,
<Q>we do want a coach; for if we walk to church in this trim, the very children in the pari&s;h will hoot after us for a &s;hew.</Q>
&mdash;Indeed, replied my wife,
<Q>I always imagined that my Charles was fond of &s;eeing his chil|dren neat and hand&s;ome about him.</Q> &mdash;
<Q>You may be as neat as you plea&s;e,</Q>
interrupted I,
<Q>and
<PB N="21" REF="012405_0020_0F8972A873590500">
I &s;hall love you the better for it; but all this is not neatne&s;s, but frippery. The&s;e rufflings, and pink|ings, and patchings, will only make us hated by all the wives of all our neighbours. No, my children,</Q>
continued I, more gravely,
<Q>tho&s;e gowns may be al|tered into &s;omething of a plainer cut; for finery is ve|ry unbecoming in us, who want the means of de|cency. I don't know whether &s;uch flouncing and &s;hredding is becoming even in the rich, if we con&s;ider, upon a moderate calculation, that the nakedne&s;s of the indigent world may be cloathed from the trim|mings of the vain.</Q></P>
<P>This remon&s;trance had the proper effect: they went with great compo&s;ure, that very in&s;tant, to change their dre&s;s; and the next day I had the &s;atisfaction of finding my daughters, at their own reque&s;t, employed in cut|ting up their trains into Sunday wai&s;tcoats for Dick and Bill, the two little ones, and what was &s;till more &s;atis|factory, the gowns &s;eemed improved by being thus cur|tailed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>A new and great acquaintance introduced.</HI> What we place mo&s;t hopes upon generally proves mo&s;t fatal.</HEAD>
<P>AT a &s;mall di&s;tance from the hou&s;e my predece&s;&s;or had made a &s;eat, over-&s;haded by an hedge of haw|thorn, and honey&s;uckle. Here when the weather was fine, and our labour &s;oon fini&s;hed, we u&s;ually all &s;at to|gether, to enjoy an exten&s;ive land&s;cape in the calm of the evening. Here too we drank tea, which now was be|come an occa&s;ional banquet; and as we had it but &s;el|dom, it diffu&s;&s;ed a new joy, the preparations for it being made with no &s;mall &s;hare of bu&s;tle and ceremony. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, our two little ones always read for us, and they were regularly &s;erved after we had done. Some|times,
<PB N="22" REF="012405_0021_0F8972A9349E46A0">
to give a variety to our amu&s;ements, the girls fung to the guitar; and while they thus formed a little concert, my wife and I would &s;troll down the &s;loping field, that was embelli&s;hed with blue bells and centaury, talk of our children with rapture, and enjoy the breeze that wa&s;ted both health and harmony.</P>
<P>In this manner we began to find that every &s;ituation in life might bring its own peculiar plea&s;ures: every morning waked us to a repetition of toil; but the even|ing repaid it with vacant hilarity.</P>
<P>It was about the beginning of autumn, on a holiday, for I kept &s;uch as intervals of relaxation from labour, that I had drawn out my family to our u&s;ual place of amu&s;ement, and our young mu&s;icians began their u&s;ual concert, as we were thus engaged, we &s;aw a &s;tag bound nimbly by, within about twenty paces of where we were &s;itting, and by its panting, it &s;eemed pre&s;t by the hunters. We had not much time to reflect upon the poor animal's di&s;tre&s;s, when we perceived the dogs and hor&s;emen come &s;weeping along at &s;ome di&s;tance be|hind, and making the very path it had taken. I was in|&s;tantly for returning in with my family, but either cu|rio&s;ity or &s;urpri&s;e, or &s;ome more hidden motive, held my wife and daughters to their &s;eats. The hunt&s;man who rode foremo&s;t, pa&s;t us with great &s;wiftne&s;s, followed by four or five per&s;ons more, who &s;eemed in equal ha&s;te. At la&s;t a young gentleman of a more genteel appearance than the re&s;t came forward, and for a while regarding us, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the chace, &s;topt &s;hort, and giving his hor&s;e to a &s;ervant who attended, approached us with a carele&s;s &s;uperior air. He &s;emeed to want no introducti|on, but was going to &s;alute my daughters as one certain of a kind reception; but they had early learnt the le&s;&s;on of looking pre&s;umption out of countenance. Upon which he let us know that his name was Thornhill, and that he was owner of the e&s;tate that lay for &s;ome extent round us. He again, therefore, offered to &s;alute the female part of the family, and &s;uch was the power of fortune and fine cloaths, that he found no &s;econd repul&s;e. As his addre&s;s, though confident, was ea&s;y, we &s;oon be|came more familiar; and perceiving mu&s;ical in&s;truments lying near, he begged to be favoured with a a &s;ong. As I
<PB N="23" REF="012405_0022_0F8972A9F4E02200">
did not approve of &s;uch di&s;proportioned acquaintances, I winked upon my daughters, in order to prevent their compliance; but my hint was counteracted by one from their mother; &s;o that with a chearful air they gave us a favourite &s;ong of Dryden's. Mr. Thornhill &s;eemed high|ly delighted with their performance and choice, and then took up the guitar him&s;elf. He played but indif|ferently; however, my elde&s;t daughter repaid his for|mer applau&s;e with intere&s;t, and a&s;&s;ured him that his tones were louder than even tho&s;e of her ma&s;ter. At this compliment he bowed, which &s;he returned with a curte&s;y. He prai&s;ed her ta&s;te, and &s;he commended his under&s;tanding: an age could not have made them better acquainted. While the fond mother too, equally hap|py, in&s;i&s;ted upon her landlord's &s;tepping in, and ta&s;ting a gla&s;s of her goo&s;eberry. The whole family &s;eemed earne&s;t to plea&s;e him: my girls attempted to entertain him with topics they thought mo&s;t modern, while Mo|&s;es on the contrary, gave him a que&s;tion or two from the ancients, for which he had the &s;atisfaction of being laughed at; for he always a&s;cribed to his wit that laugh|ter which was lavi&s;hed at his &s;implicity: my little ones were no le&s;s bu&s;y, and fondly &s;tuck clo&s;e to the &s;tranger. All my endeavours could &s;carce keep their fingers from handling and tarni&s;hing the lace on his cloaths, and lift|ing up the flaps of his pocket holes, to &s;ee what was there. At the approach of evening he took his leave; but not till he had reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to renew his vi&s;it, which, as he was our landlord, we mo&s;t readily agreed to.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, my wife called a council on the conduct of the day. She was of opinion that it was a mo&s;t fortunate hit; for that &s;he had known even &s;tran|ger things at la&s;t brought to bear. She hoped again to &s;ee the day in which we might hold up our heads with the be&s;t of them; and concluded, &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he could &s;ee no rea&s;on why the two Mi&s;s Wrinkles &s;hould marry great fortunes, and her children get none. As this la&s;t argument was directed to me, I prote&s;ted I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould &s;ee no rea&s;on for it neither, nor why one got the ten thou&s;and pound prize in the lottery, and another &s;at down with a blank. "But tho&s;e," added I,
<Q>who either aim at
<PB N="24" REF="012405_0023_0F8972AAB3F08A10">
hu&s;bands greater than them&s;elves, or at the ten thou|&s;and pound prize, have been fools for their ridiculous claims, whether &s;ucce&s;sful or not.</Q>
<Q>I prote&s;t, Charles,</Q>
cried my wife,
<Q>this is the way you always damp my girls and me, when we are in &s;pirits. Tell me Sophy, my dear, what do you think of our new vi&s;itor? Don't you think he &s;eemed to be good-na|tured?</Q>
&mdash;"Immen&s;ely &s;o, indeed, Mamma," re|plied &s;he.
<Q>I think he has a great deal to &s;ay upon every thing, and is never at a lo&s;s; and the more trifling the &s;ubject, the more he has to &s;ay; and what is more, I prote&s;t he is very hand&s;ome.</Q>
&mdash;"Yes," cried Oliva,
<Q>he is well enough for a man; but, for my part, I don't much like him, he is &s;o extremely impudent and familiar, but on the guitar he is &s;hock|ing.</Q>
The&s;e two la&s;t &s;peeches I interpreted by con|traries. I found by this, that Sophia internally de&s;pi&s;ed, as much as Olivia &s;ecretly admired him.&mdash;
<Q>What|ever may be your opinions of him, my children,</Q>
cri|ed I,
<Q>to confe&s;s a truth, he has not prepo&s;&s;e&s;t me in his favour. Di&s;proportioned friend&s;hips ever termi|nate in di&s;gu&s;t; and I thought notwith&s;tanding all his ca&s;e that he &s;eemed perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;|tance between us.

This well-timed pre&s;ent pleaded more powerfully in his &s;avour, than any thing I had to &s;ay could obviate.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The happine&s;s of a country fire-&s;ide.</HEAD>
<P>AS we carried on the former di&s;pute with &s;ome de|gree of warmth, in order to accommodate matters it was univer&s;ally concluded upon, that we &s;hould have a part of the veni&s;on for &s;upper, and the girls undertook the ta&s;k with alacrity. "I am &s;orry," cried I,
<Q>that we have no neighbour or &s;tranger to take a part in this good cheer: fea&s;ts of this kind acquire a double reli&s;h from ho&s;pitality.</Q> &mdash;
<Q>Ble&s;s me, cried my wife, here comes our good friend Mr. Burchell, that &s;aved our Sophia, and that run you down fairly in the argument.</Q> &mdash;"Confute me in argument, child!" cried I.
<Q>You mi&s;take there, my dear. I believe there are but few that can do that: I never di&s;pute your abilities at making a goo&s;e-pye, and I beg you'll leave argument to me,</Q> &mdash;As I &s;poke, poor Mr. Bur|chell entered the hou&s;e, and was welcomed by the fami|ly, who &s;hook him heartily by the hand, while little Dick officiou&s;ly reached him a chair.</P>
<P>I was plea&s;ed with the poor man's friend&s;hip for two rea&s;ons; becau&s;e I knew that he wanted mine, and I knew him to be friendly as far as he was able. He was known in our neighbourhood by the character of the poor Gentleman that would do no good when he was young, though he was not yet above thirty. He would at intervals talk with great good &s;en&s;e; but in general he was fonde&s;t of the company of children, whom he u&s;ed to call harmle&s;s little men. He was famous, I found, for &s;inging them ballads, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling them &s;tories; and &s;eldom went without &s;omething in his pockets for them, a piece of ginger-bread, or a ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">penny whi&s;tle.

of Beverland, with the hi&s;tory of Patient Gri&s;&s;el. The adventures of Cat&s;kin next entertained them, and then Fair Ro&s;amond's bower. Our cock, which always crew at eleven, now told us it was time for repo&s;e; but an unfore&s;een difficulty &s;tarted about lodging the &s;tranger: all our beds were already taken up, and it was too late to &s;end him to the next ale-hou&s;e. In this dilemma, little Dick offered him his part of the bed, if his brother Mo&s;es would let him lie with him; And I, cried Bill,
<Q>will give Mr. Burchell my part, if my &s;i&s;ters will take me to theirs</Q> &mdash;"Well done, my good children," cried I,
<Q>ho&s;pitality is one of the fir&s;t chri&s;tian duties. The bea&s;t retires to its &s;helter, and the bird flies to its ne&s;t; but helple&s;s man can only find refuge from his fellow creature. The greate&s;t &s;tranger in this world, was he that came to &s;ave it. He never had an hou&s;e as if willing to &s;ee what ho&s;pitality was left re|maining among&s;t us. Deborah, my dear,</Q> cried I, to my wife,
<Q>give tho&s;e boys a lump of &s;ugar each, and let Dick's be the large&s;t, becau&s;e he &s;poke fir&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>In the morning early I called out my whole family to help at &s;aving an after-growth of hay, and our gue&s;t of|fering his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was accepted among the number. Our labours went on lightly, we turned the &s;wath to the wind, I went foremo&s;t, and the re&s;t followed in due &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. I could not avoid, however, ob&s;erving the a&s;|&s;iduity of Mr. Burchell, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting my daughter Sophia in her part of the ta&s;k. When he had fini&s;hed his own, he would join in her's, and enter into a clo&s;e conver&s;ation: but I had too good an opinion of Sophia's under&s;tand|ing&punc; and was too well convinced of her ambition, to be under any unea&s;ine&s;s from a man of a broken fortune. When we were fini&s;hed for the day, Mr. Burchell was invited as on the night before; but he refu&s;ed, as he was to lie that night at a neighbour's to who&s;e child he was carrying a whi&s;tle. When gone, our conver&s;ation at &s;up|per turned upon our late unfortunate gue&s;t.
<Q>What a &s;trong in&s;tance.</Q> &s;aid I,
<Q>is that poor man of the mi&s;eries attending a youth of levity and extravagance. He by no means wants &s;en&s;e, which only &s;erves to ag|gravate his former folly. Poor forlorn creature, where are now the revellers, the flatterers, that he
<PB N="27" REF="012405_0026_0F8972ACF3EA8AE8">
could once in&s;pire and command! Gone, perhaps, to attend the bagnio pander, grown rich by his extrava|gance. They once prai&s;ed him, and now they applaud the pander: their former raptures at his wit, are now converted into &s;arca&s;ms at his folly: he is poor, and perhaps de&s;erves poverty; for he has neither the am|bition to be independent, nor the &s;kill to be u&s;eful.</Q>
Prompted, perhaps, by &s;ome &s;ecret rea&s;ons, I delivered this ob&s;ervation with too much acrimony, which my Sophia gently reproved.
<Q>What&s;oever his former con|duct may be, papa, his circum&s;tances &s;hould exempt him from cen&s;ure now. His pre&s;ent indigence is a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment for former folly; and I have heard my papa him&s;elf &s;ay, that we &s;hould never &s;trike our unnece&s;&s;ary blow at a victim over whom providence already holds the &s;courge of its re&s;ent|ment.</Q> &mdash;"You are right, Sophy," cried my &s;on Mo&s;es,
<Q>and one of the ancients finely repre&s;ents &s;o malicious a conduct, by the attempts of a ru&s;tic to flay Mar&s;yas, who&s;e &s;kin, the fable tells us, had been wholly &s;tript off by another. Be&s;ides, I don't know if this poor man's &s;ituation be &s;o bad as my father would repre&s;ent it. We are not to judge of the feel|ings of others, by what we might feel if in their place. However dark the habitation of the mole to our eyes, yet the animal it&s;elf, finds the apartment &s;ufficiently light&s;ome. And to confe&s;s a truth, this man's mind &s;eems fitted to his &s;tation; for I never heard any one more &s;prightly than he was to-day, when he conver&s;ed with you.</Q> &mdash;This was &s;aid without the lea&s;t de|&s;ign, however it excited a blu&s;h, which &s;he &s;trove to cover by an affected laugh, a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he &s;carce took any notice of what he &s;aid to her; but that &s;he believed he might once have been a very fine gentle|man. The readine&s;s with which &s;he undertook to vin|dicate her&s;elf, and her blu&s;hing were &s;ymptoms I did not internally approve; but I repre&s;t my &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>As we expected our landlord the next day, my wife went to make the veni&s;on pa&s;ty; Mo&s;es &s;at reading, while I taught the little ones: my daughters &s;eemed e|qually bu&s;y with the re&s;t; and I ob&s;erved them for a good while cooking &s;omething over the fire. I at fir&s;t

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A town wit de&s;cribed. The dulle&s;t fellows may learn to be comical for a night or two.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our young landlord, it may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed what provi&s;ions were exhau&s;ted to make an appearance. It may al&s;o be conjectured, that my wife and daughters expanded their gaye&s;t plumage upon this occa&s;ion. Mr. Thornhill came with a couple of friends, his chaplain and feeder. The &s;ervants, who were nu|merous, he politely ordered to the next ale-hou&s;e: but my wife, in the triumph of her heart, in&s;i&s;ted on enter|taining them all; for which, by the bye, the family was pinched for three weeks after. As Mr. Burchell had hinted to us the day before, that he was making &s;ome propo&s;als of marriage to Mi&s;s Wilmot, my &s;on George's former mi&s;tre&s;s, this a good deal damped the heartine&s;s of his reception: but accident, in &s;ome mea&s;ure relieved our embarra&s;&s;ment; for one of the company happening to mention her name, Mr. Thornhill ob&s;erved with an oath, that he never knew any thing more ab&s;urd than calling &s;uch a fright a beauty: "for &s;trike me ugly," continued he,
<Q>if I &s;hould not find as much plea&s;ure in choo&s;ing my mi&s;tre&s;s by the information of a lamp un|der the clock at St. Du&s;tan's.</Q> At this he laughed, and &s;o did we:&mdash;the je&s;ts of the rich are ever &s;ucce&s;sful.
<PB N="29" REF="012405_0028_0F8972AE74FF0440">
Olivia too, could not avoid whi&s;pering, loud enough to be heard, that he had an infinite fund of humour.</P>
<P>After dinner, I began with my u&s;ual toa&s;t, the church; for this I was thanked by the chaplain, as he &s;aid the church was the only mi&s;tre&s;s of his affecti|ons. &mdash;"Come tell us hone&s;tly, Frank," &s;aid the 'Squire, with his u&s;ual archne&s;s, "&s;uppo&s;e the church, your pre&s;ent mi&s;tre&s;s, dre&s;t in lawn &s;leeves, on one hand, and Mi&s;s Sophia, with no lawn about her on the other, which would you be for?" "For both, to be &s;ure," cried the chaplain.&mdash;"Right Frank," cried the 'Squire; "for may this gla&s;s &s;uffocate me but a fine girl is worth all the prie&s;tcraft in the na|tion. For what are tythes and tricks but an impo|&s;ition, all a confounded impo&s;ture, and I can prove it." &mdash;"I wi&s;h you would," cried my &s;on Mo&s;es, "and I think," continued he, "that I &s;hould be able to combat in the oppo&s;ition."&mdash;"Very well, Sir," cried the 'Squire, who immediately &s;moaked him, and winking on the re&s;t of the company, to prepare us for the &s;port, "if you are for a cool argument upon that &s;ubject, I am ready to accept the challenge. And fir&s;t, whether are you for managing it analogically, or dialogically? "I am for managing it rationally," cried Mo&s;es, quite happy at being permitted to di&s;pute. "Good again," cried the 'Squire, and fir&s;tly, of the fir&s;t. I hope you'll not deny that whatever is is. If you dont grant me that, I can go no further."&mdash;Why," return'd Mo&s;es, "I think I may grant that, and make the be&s;t of it."&mdash;"I hope too," returned the other, "you'll grant that a part is le&s;s than the whole." "I grant that too," cried Mo&s;es, "it is but ju&s;t and rea|&s;onable." &mdash;"I hope, cried the 'Squire, "you will not deny, that the two angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones."&mdash;"Nothing can be plainer," return'd t'other, and looked round with his u&s;ual importance.&mdash;"Very well," cried the 'Squire &s;peaking very quick, "the premi&s;es being thus &s;ettled, I proceed to ob&s;erve, that the concatenation of &s;elf exi&s;tences, proceeding in a reciprocal duplicate ratio, naturally produce a problematical dialogi&s;m, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure proves that the e&s;&s;ence of &s;pirituality may
<PB N="30" REF="012405_0029_0F8972AF333D10C0">
be referred to the &s;econd predicable."&mdash;"Hold, hold," cried the other, "I deny that: Do you think I can thus tamely &s;ubmit to &s;uch heterodox doctrines?" &mdash;"What," replied the 'Squire, as if in a pa&s;&s;i|on, "not &s;ubmit! An&s;wer me one plain que&s;tion; Do you think Ari&s;totle right when he &s;ays, that relatives are related?" undoubtedly," replied the other.&mdash; "If &s;o then," cried the 'Squire, "an&s;wer me directly to what I propo&s;e; Whether do you judge the analyti|cal inve&s;tigation of the fir&s;t part of my enthymem defici|ent &s;ecundum quoad, or quoad minus, and give me your rea&s;ons, too: give me your rea&s;ons I &s;ay, directly," "I prote&s;t," cried Mo&s;es, I don't rightly comprehend the force of your rea&s;oning; but if it be reduced to one &s;im|ple propo&s;ition, I fancy it may have an an&s;wer,"&mdash;"O then &s;ir," cried the 'Squire, "I am your mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, I find you want me to furni&s;h you with argument and intellects both. No, Sir, there I prote&s;t you are too hard for me." This effectually rai&s;ed the laugh again&s;t poor Mo&s;es, who &s;ate the only di&s;mal figure in a groupe of merry faces: nor did he offer a &s;ingle &s;yllable more dur|ing the whole entertainment.</P>
<P>But though all this gave me no plea&s;ure, it had a very different effect upon Olivia, who mi&s;took this humour, which was a mere act of the memory, for real wit. She thought him therefore a very fine gentleman: and &s;uch as con&s;ider what powerful ingredients a good figure, fine cloaths, and fortune, are in that character, will ea&s;ily forgive her. Mr. Thornhill notwith&s;tanding his real ignorance, talked with ea&s;e, and could expatiate upon the common topics of conver&s;ation with fluency. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing then, that &s;uch talents &s;hould win the af|fections of a girl, who by education was taught to value an appearance in her&s;elf, and con&s;equently to &s;et a value upon it when found in another.</P>
<P>Upon his departure, we again entered into a debate upon the merits of our young landlord. As he directed his looks and conver&s;ation to Olivia, it was no longer doubted but that &s;he was the object that induced him to be our vi&s;itor. Nor did &s;he &s;eem to be much di&s;plea&s;ed at the innocent raillery of her brother and &s;i&s;ter upon this occa&s;ion. Even Deborah her&s;elf &s;eemed to &s;hare the
<PB N="31" REF="012405_0030_0F8972AFF1E8FE28">
glory of the day, and exulted in her daughter's victory as if it were her own. "And now, my dear," cried &s;he to me, "I'll fairly own, that it was I that in&s;tructed my girls to encourage our landlord's addre&s;&s;es. I had al|ways &s;ome ambition, and you now &s;ee that I was right; for who knows how this may end?" Ay, who knows that indeed? an&s;wered I, with a groan: "for my own part I don't much like it; and I could have been better plea&s;ed with one that was poor and hone&s;t, than this fine gentleman with his fortune and infidelity, for depend on't; if he be what I &s;u&s;pect him, no free-thinker &s;hall ever have a child of mine.</P>
<P>"Sure, father," cried Mo&s;es, "you are too &s;evere in this; for heaven will never arraign him for what he thinks, but for what he does. Every man has a thou|&s;and vicious thoughts, which ari&s;e without his power to &s;uppre&s;s. Thinking freely of religion, may be invo|luntary with this gentleman; &s;o that allowing his &s;enti|ments to be wrong, yet as he is purely pa&s;&s;ive in their re|ception, he is no more to be blamed for their incur&s;ions, than the governor of a city without walls for the &s;helter he is obliged to afford an invading enemy."</P>
<P>"True, my &s;on," cried I; "but if the governor in|vites the enemy, there he is ju&s;tly culpable. And &s;uch is always the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who embrace error. The vice does not lie in a&s;&s;enting to the proofs they &s;ee; but in being blind to many of the proofs that offer. Like corrupt judges on a bench, they determine right on that part of the evidence they hear; but they will not hear all the evidence. Thus, my &s;on, though our erroneous opinions be involuntary when formed, yet as we have been wilfully corrupt, or very negligent in forming them, we de&s;erve puni&s;hment for our v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or contempt for our folly."</P>
<P>My wife now kept up the conver&s;ation, though not the argument: &s;he ob&s;erved, that &s;everal very prudent men of our acquaintance were free thinkers, and made very good hu&s;bands; and &s;he knew &s;ome &s;en&s;ible girls, that had &s;kill enough to make converts of their &s;pou&s;es: "And who knows, my dear," continued &s;he, "what Olivia may be able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o? The girl has a great deal to
<PB N="32" REF="012405_0031_0F8972B17ABF7D60">
&s;ay upon every &s;ubject, and to my knowledge is very well &s;killed in controver&s;y."</P>
<P>"Why, my dear, what controver&s;y can &s;he have read?" cried I. "It does not occur to my memory that I ever put &s;uch books into her hands: you certainly over-rate her merit," "Indeed, papa, replied Olivia, "&s;he does not: I have read a great deal of controver&s;y. I have read the di&s;putes between Thwackum and Square; the controver&s;y between Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe and Friday the &s;avage, and I am now employed in reading the con|trover&s;y in the Religious court&s;hip."&mdash;"Very well," cried I, "that's a good girl, I find you are perfectly qualified for making converts, and &s;o go help your mo|ther to make the goo&s;eberry-pye."</P>

<P>THE next morning we were again vi&s;ited by Mr. Burchell, though I began, for certain rea|&s;ons, to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the frequency of his re|turn; but I could not refu&s;e him my company and fire-&s;ide. It is true, his labour more than requited his entertainments; for he wrought among us with vigour, and either in the meadow or at the hay-rick, put him&s;elf foremo&s;t. Be&s;ides, he had always &s;omething amu&s;ing to &s;ay, that le&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed our toil, and was at once &s;o out of the way, and yet &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that I loved, laughed at, and pitied him. My only di&s;like aro&s;e from an attach|ment he di&s;covered to my daughter: he would, in a je&s;ting manner, call her his little mi&s;tre&s;s, and when he bought each of the girls a &s;et of ribbands, her'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was the fine&s;t. I knew not how, but he every day &s;eemed to become more amiable, his wit to improve, and his &s;implicity to a&s;&s;ume the &s;uperior airs of wi&s;|dom.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="012405_0032_0F8972B282CDE540">Our family dined in the field, and we &s;ate, or rather reclined, round a temperate repa&s;t, our cloth &s;pread up|on the hay, while Mr. Burchel &s;eemed to give chear|fulne&s;s to the fea&s;t. To heighten our &s;atisfaction two blackbirds an&s;wered each other from oppo&s;ite hedges, the familiar red-brea&s;t came and pecked the crumbs from our hands, and every &s;ound &s;eemed but the echo of tranquillity. "I never &s;it thus," &s;ays Sophia, "but I think of the two lovers, &s;o &s;weetly de&s;cribed by Mr. Gay, who were &s;truck dead in each other's arms under a barley mow. There is &s;omething &s;o pathetic in the de&s;cription, that I have read it an hun|dred times with new rapture."&mdash;"In my opinion," cried my &s;on, "the fine&s;t &s;trokes in that de&s;cription, are much below tho&s;e in the Acis and Galatea of Ovid. The Roman poet under&s;tands the u&s;e of <HI>contra&s;t</HI> better, and upon that figure artfully managed all &s;trength in the pa|thetic depends."&mdash;"It is remarkable," cried Mr. Burchell, "that both the poets you mention, have e|qually contributed to introduce a fal&s;e ta&s;te into their re|&s;pective countries, by loading all their lines with epithet. Men of little genius found them mo&s;t ea&s;ily imitated in their defects, and Engli&s;h poetry, like that in the latter empire of Rome, is nothing at pre&s;ent but a combination of luxuriant images, without plot or connexion; a &s;tring of epithets that improve the &s;ound, without carrying on the &s;en&s;e. But, perhaps, madam, while I thus repre|hend others, you'll think it ju&s;t that I &s;hould give them an opportunity to retaliate, and indeed I have made this remark, only to have an opportunity of introducing to the company a ballad, which, whatever be its other de|fects, is, I think, at lea&s;t free from tho&s;e I have menti|oned."</P>

<P><PB N="38" REF="012405_0037_0F8972B5F34CEB58">While this ballad was reading, Sophia &s;eemed to fix an ear of tenderne&s;s with her approbation. But our tran|quillity was &s;oon di&s;turbed by the report of a gun ju&s;t by us, and immediately after a man was &s;een bur&s;ting thro' the hedge, to take up the game he had killed. This &s;port&s;man was the 'Squire's chaplain, who had &s;hot one of the black birds that &s;o agreeably entertained us. So loud a report, and &s;o near, &s;tartled my daughters; and I could perceive that Sophia in the fright had thrown her&s;elf into Mr. Burchell's arms for protection. The gen|tleman came up, and a&s;ked pardon for having di&s;turbed us, affirming that he was ignorant of our being &s;o near. He therefore &s;ate down by my younge&s;t daughter, and, &s;port&s;man like, offered her what he had killed that morn|ing. She was going to refu&s;e, but a private look from her mother &s;oon induced her to correct the mi&s;take, and accept his pre&s;ent, though with &s;ome reluctance. My wife, as u&s;ual di&s;covered her pride in a whi&s;per, ob&s;erv|ing, that Sophy had made a conque&s;t of the chaplain, as well as her &s;i&s;ter had of the 'Squire. I &s;u&s;pected how|ever, with more probability, that her affections were placed upon a different object. The chaplain's errand was to inform us, that Mr. Thornhill had provided mu|&s;ic and refre&s;hments, and intended that night giving the young ladies a ball by moon-light, on the gra&s;s-plot be|fore our door. "Nor can I deny," continued he, but I have an intere&s;t in being fir&s;t to deliver this me&s;&s;age, as I expect for my reward to be honoured with mi&s;s Sophia's hand as a partner." To this my girl replied, that &s;he &s;hould have no objection, if &s;he could do it with honour: "But here," continued &s;he, "is a gentleman," looking at Mr Burchell&punc; "who has been my companion in the ta&s;k for the day, and it is fit he &s;hould &s;hare in its amu&s;e|ments." Mr. Burchell returned her a compliment for her intentions; but re&s;igned her up to the chaplain, adding, that he was to go that night five miles, being invited to an harve&s;t &s;upper. His refu&s;al appeared to me a little extraordinary, nor could I conceive how &s;o &s;en&s;ible a girl as my younge&s;t, could thus prefer a middle aged man of broken fortune, to a &s;prightly young fellow of twenty-two. But as men are mo&s;t capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing me|rit in women, &s;o the ladies often form the true&s;t judg|ments

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Two ladies of great di&s;tinction introduced. Superior finery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver &s;eems to confer &s;uperior breeding.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Burchell had &s;carce taken leave, and Sophia con&s;ented to dance with the chaplain, when my little ones came running out to tell us that the 'Squire was come, with a crowd of company. Upon our return, we found our landlord, with a couple of under gentlemen and two young ladies richly dre&s;t, whom he introduced as women of very great di&s;tinction and fa&s;hion from town. We happened not to have chairs enough for the whole company; but Mr. Thornhill immediately propo&s;ed that every gentleman &s;hould &s;it in a lady's lap. This I po&s;i|tively objected to, notwith&s;tanding a look of di&s;approba|tion from my wife. Mo&s;es was therefore di&s;patched to borrow a couple of chairs; and as we were in want of ladies al&s;o to make up a &s;et at country dances, the two gentlemen went with him in que&s;t of a couple of part|ners. Chairs and partners were &s;oon provided. The gentlemen returned with my neighbour Flamborough's ro&s;y daughters, flaunting with red top-knots. But there was an unlucky circum&s;tance which was not adverted to; though the Mi&s;s Flamboroughs were reckoned the very be&s;t dancers in the pari&s;h, and under&s;tood the jig and the round-about to perfection; yet they were totally unac|quainted with country dances. This at fir&s;t di&s;compo&s;ed us: however, after a little &s;hoving and dragging, they beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to go merrily on. Our mu&s;ic con&s;i&s;ted of two fid|dles, with a pipe and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">bor. The moon &s;hone bright, Mr. Thornhill and my elde&s;t daughter led up the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, to the great delight of the &s;pectators; for the neighbours hearing what was going forward, came flocking about us. My gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> moved with &s;o much grace and vivacity, that my wife could not avoid di&s;covering the pride of
<PB N="40" REF="012405_0039_0F8972B772164018">
her heart, by a&s;&s;uring me, that though the little chit did it &s;o cleverly, all the &s;teps were &s;tolen from her&s;elf. The ladies of the town &s;trove hard to be equally ea&s;y, but without &s;ucce&s;s. They &s;wam, &s;prawled, langui&s;hed, and fri&s;ked; but all would not do: the gazers indeed owned that it was fine; but neighbour Flamborough ob&s;erved, that Mi&s;s Livy's feet &s;eemed as pat to the mu&s;ic as its echo. After the dance had continued about an hour, the two ladies, who were apprehen&s;ive of catching cold, moved to break up the ball. One of them, I thought, expre&s;&s;ed her &s;entiments upon this occa&s;ion in a very coar&s;e manner, when &s;he ob&s;erved, that by the <HI>living jingo,</HI> &s;he was all of a muck of &s;weat. Upon our return to the hou&s;e, we found a very elegant cold &s;upper, which Mr. Thornhill had ordered to be brought with him. The conver&s;ation at this time was more re&s;erved than before. The two ladies threw my girls quite into the &s;hade; for they would talk of nothing but high life, and high lived company; with other fa&s;hionable topics, &s;uch as pic|tures, ta&s;te, Shake&s;pear, and the mu&s;ical gla&s;&s;es. 'Tis true they once or twice mortified us &s;en&s;ibly by &s;lipping out an oath; but that appeared to me as the &s;ure&s;t &s;ymp|tom of their di&s;tinction, (tho' I am &s;ince informed &s;wear|ing is now perfectly unfa&s;hionable.) Their finery, how|ever, threw a viel over any gro&s;&s;ne&s;s in their conver&s;ati|on. My daughters &s;eemed to regard their &s;uperior ac|compli&s;hments with envy; and what appeared ami&s;s was a&s;cribed to tip-top quality breeding. But the conde&s;cen|&s;ion of the ladies was &s;till &s;uperior to their other accom|pli&s;hments. One of them ob&s;erved, that had mi&s;s Olivia &s;een a little more of the world, it would greatly improve her. To which the other added, that a &s;ingle winter in town would make her little Sophia quite another thing. My wife warmly a&s;&s;ented to both; adding, that there was nothing &s;he more ardently wi&s;hed, than to give her girls a &s;ingle winter's poli&s;hing. To this I could not help replying, that their breeding was already &s;uperior to their fortune; and that greater refinement would only &s;erve to make their poverty ridiculous, and give them a ta&s;te for plea&s;ures they had no right to po&s;&s;e&s;s."&mdash;"And what plea&s;ures," cried Mr. Thornhill, "do they not de&s;erve, who have &s;o much in their power to be&s;tow? As for my part," continued he, "my fortune is pretty large, love,
<PB N="41" REF="012405_0040_0F8972B8330E4C18">
liberty, and plea&s;ure, are my maxims; but cur&s;e me if a &s;ettlement of half my e&s;tate could give my charming Oli|via plea&s;ure, it &s;hould be her's; and the only favour I would a&s;k in return, would be to add my&s;elf to the be|nefit." I was not &s;uch a &s;tranger to the world as to be ignorant that this was the fa&s;hionable cant to di&s;gui&s;e the in&s;olence of the ba&s;e&s;t propo&s;al; but I made an effort to &s;uppre&s;s my re&s;entment. "Sir," cried I, "the family which you now conde&s;cend to favour with your compa|ny, has been bred with as nice a &s;en&s;e of honour as you. Any attempts to injure that, may be attended with very dangerous con&s;equences. Honour, Sir, is our only po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion at pre&s;ent, and of that la&s;t trea&s;ure we mu&s;t be particularly careful."&mdash;I was &s;oon &s;orry for the warmth with which I had &s;poken this, when the young gentleman, gra&s;ping my hand, &s;wore he commended my &s;pirit, though he di&s;approved my &s;u&s;picions. "As to your pre&s;ent hint, continued he," "I prote&s;t nothing was farther from my heart than &s;uch a thought. No, by all that's tempting, the virtue that will &s;tand a regu|lar &s;iege was never to my ta&s;te; for all my amours are carried by a coup de main."</P>
<P>The two ladies, who affected to be ignorant of the re&s;t, &s;eemed highly di&s;plea&s;ed with this la&s;t &s;troke of free|dom, and began a very di&s;creet and &s;erious dialogue up|on virtue: in this my wife, the chaplain, and I, &s;oon joined; and the 'Squire him&s;elf was at la&s;t brought to confe&s;s a &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow for his former exce&s;&s;es. We talked of the plea&s;ures of temperance, and the &s;un-&s;hine in the mind unpolluted with guilt. I was well plea&s;ed that my little ones were kept up beyond the u&s;ual time to be edified by &s;uch good conver&s;ation. Mr. Thornhill even went beyond me, and demanded if I had any objec|tion to giving prayers. I joyfully embraced the propo&s;al, and in this manner the night was pa&s;&s;ed in a mo&s;t com|fortable way, till at la&s;t the company began to think of returning. The ladies &s;eemed very unwilling to part from my daughters; for whom they had conceived a par|ticular affection, and joined in a reque&s;t to have the plea&s;ure of their company home. The 'Squire &s;econded the propo&s;al, and my wife added her entreaties: the girls
<PB N="42" REF="012405_0041_0F8972B8F7489A68">
too looked upon me as if they wi&s;hed to go. In this per|plexity I made two or three excu&s;es, which my daughters as readily removed: &s;o that at la&s;t I was obliged to give a preremptory refu&s;al; for which we had nothing but &s;ullen looks and &s;hort an&s;wers the whole day en&s;uing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. The family endeavours to cope with their betters. The mi&s;eries of the poor when they attempt to appear above their circum&s;tances.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW began to find that all my long and painful lec|tures upon temperance, &s;implicity and contentment, were entirely di&s;regarded. The di&s;tinctions lately paid us by our betters awaked that pride which I had laid a&s;leep, but not removed. Our windows now again, as formerly, were filled with wa&s;hes for the neck and face. The &s;un was dreaded as an enemy to the &s;kin without doors, and the fire as a &s;poiler of the complexion within. My wife ob&s;erved, that ri&s;ing too early would hurt her daughter's eyes, that working after dinner would redden their no&s;es, and convinced me, that the hands never looked &s;o white as when they did nothing. In&s;tead therefore of fini&s;hing George's &s;hirts we now had them new modelling their old Gauzes, or flouri&s;hing upon cat|gut. The poor Mi&s;s Flamboroughs, their former gay companions, were ca&s;t off as mean acquaintance, and the whole conver&s;ation ran upon high life and high lived company, with pictures, ta&s;te, Shake&s;pear, and the mu|&s;ical gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But we could have borne all this, had not a fortune- telling gyp&s;ey come to rai&s;e us into perfect &s;ublimity. The tawny &s;ybil no &s;ooner appeared, than my girls came running to me for a &s;hilling a-piece to cro&s;s her hand with &s;ilver. To &s;ay the truth, I was tired of being always wi&s;e, and could not help gratifying their reque&s;t, be|cau&s;e I loved to &s;ee them happy. I gave each of them
<PB N="43" REF="012405_0042_0F8972B9B200BC48">
a &s;hilling; though, for the honour of the family, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that they never went without money them|selves, as my wife always generou&s;ly let them have a guinea each, to keep in their pockets: but with &s;trict injunctions never to change it. After they had been clo|&s;etted up with the fortune-teller for &s;ome time, I knew by their looks, upon their returning, that they had been promi&s;ed &s;omething great.&mdash;"Well, my girls, how "have you &s;ped? Tell me, Livy, has the fortune-tel|ler given thee a pennyworth?"&mdash;"I prote&s;t, papa," &s;ays the girl with a &s;erious face, "I believe &s;he deals with &s;ome body that's not right; for &s;he po&s;itively de|clared, that I am to be married to a great 'Squire in le&s;s than a twelve-month?&mdash;"Well now Sophy, my child," &s;aid I, "and what &s;ort of a hu&s;band are you to have?" "Sir, replied &s;he, "I am to have a Lord &s;oon after my &s;i&s;ter has been married to the 'Squire."&mdash; "How," cried I, "is that all you are to have for your "two &s;hillings! Only a Lord and a 'Squire for two &s;hil|lings! You fools, I could have promi&s;ed you a prince and Nabob for half the money."</P>
<P>This curio&s;ity of theirs, however was attended with very &s;erious effects; we now began to think our&s;elves de|&s;igned by the &s;tars for &s;omething exalted, and already anticipated our future grandeur."</P>
<P>It has been a thou&s;and times ob&s;erved, and I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve it once more, that the hours we pa&s;s with happy pro&s;pects in view, are more plea&s;ing than tho&s;e crowned with fruition. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e we cook the di&s;h to our own appetite; in the latter nature cooks it for us. It is impo&s;&s;ible to repeat the train of agreeable reveries we call up for our entertainment. We looked upon our fortunes as once more ri&s;ing; and as the whole pari&s;h a&s;&s;erted that the 'Squire was in love with my daughter, &s;he was actually &s;o with him; for they per&s;uaded her into pa&s;&s;ion. In this agreeable interval, my wife had the mo&s;t luckly dreams in the world, which &s;he took care to tell us every morning, with great &s;olemnity and exact|ne&s;s. It was one night a coffin and cro&s;s bones, the &s;ign of an approaching wedding, at another time &s;he imagin|ed her daughter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s pockets filled with farthings, a certain &s;ign of their being one day &s;tuffed with gold. The girls
<PB N="44" REF="012405_0043_0F8972BA71E51DF8">
had their omens too: they felt &s;trange ki&s;&s;es on their lips; they &s;aw rings in the candle, pur&s;es bounced from the fire, and true love-knots lurked at the bottom of eve|ry tea-cup.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the week we received a card from the town ladies; in which, with their compliments, they hoped to &s;ee all our family at church the Sunday follow|ing. All Saturday morning I could perceive, in con&s;e|quence of this, my wife and daughters in clo&s;e conference together, and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot. To be &s;incere, I had &s;trong &s;u&s;picions that &s;ome ab&s;urd propo&s;al was preparing for appearing with &s;plendor the next day. In the evening they began their operations in a very regular manner, and my wife undertook to conduct the &s;iege. After tea, when I &s;eemed in &s;pirits, &s;he began thus&mdash;"I fancy, Charles, my dear, we &s;hall have a great deal of good company at our church to-morrow."&mdash;"Perhaps we may, my dear," returned I; though you need be under no unea&s;ine&s;s about that, you &s;hall have a &s;ermon whether there be or not."&mdash;"That is what I expect," returned &s;he; "but I think, my dear, we ought to appear there as decently as po&s;&s;ible, for who knows what may happen?" "Your precautions," replied I, "are highly commendable. A decent behaviour and appearance in church is what charms me. We &s;hould be devout and humble, chear|ful and &s;erene."&mdash;"Yes," cried &s;he, "I know that: but I mean we &s;hould go there in as proper a manner as po&s;&s;ible; not altogether like the &s;crubs about us." "You are quite right, my dear," returned I, "and I was going to make the very &s;ame propo&s;al. The proper manner of going is, to go there as early as po&s;&s;ible, to have time for meditation before the &s;ervice begins."&mdash;"Phoo, Charles," interrupted &s;he, "all that is very true; but not what I would be at. I mean, we &s;hould go there genteelly. You know the church is two miles off, and I prote&s;t I don't like to &s;ee my daughters trudging up to their pew all blouzed and red with walking, and looking for all the world as if they had been winners at a &s;mock race. Now, my dear, my propo&s;al is this: there are our two plow hor&s;es, the colt that has been in our fa|mily the&s;e nine years, and his companion Blackberry, that
<PB N="45" REF="012405_0044_0F8972BBF9BDA978">
that have &s;carce done an earthly thing for this month pa&s;t, and are both grown fat and lazy. Why &s;hould not they do &s;omething as well as we? And, let me tell you, when Mo&s;es has trimmed them a little, they will not be &s;o contemptible."</P>
<P>To this propo&s;al I objected, that walking would be twenty times more genteel than &s;uch a paltry conveyance, as Blackberry was wall-eyed, and the Colt wanted a tail: that they had never been broke to the rein; but had an hundred vicious tricks; and that we had but one &s;addle and pillion in the whole hou&s;e. All the&s;e objections, however were over-ruled; &s;o that I was obliged to com|ply. The next morning I perceived them not a little bu&s;y in collecting &s;uch materials as might be nece&s;&s;ary for the expedition; but as I found it would be a bu&s;ine&s;s of much time, I walked on to the church before, and they promi&s;ed &s;peedily to follow. I waited near and hour in the reading de&s;k for their arrival; but not finding them come as expected, I was obliged to begin, and went through the &s;ervice, not without &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at find|ing them ab&s;ent. This was encrea&s;ed when all was fi|nished, and no appearance of the family. I therefore walked back by the hor&s;eway, which was five miles round, though the foot-way was but two, and when got about half way home, perceived the proce&s;&s;ion marching &s;lowly forward towards the church; my &s;on, my wife, and the two little ones exalted upon one hor&s;e, and my two daughters upon the other. I demanded the cau&s;e of their delay; but I &s;oon found by their looks they had met with a thou&s;and misfortunes on the road. The hor&s;es had at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to move from the door, till Mr. Bur|chell was kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his cudgel. Next the &s;traps of my wife's pillion broke down, and they were obliged to &s;top to repair them before they could proceed. After that, one of the hor&s;es took it into his head to &s;tand &s;till, and neither blows nor entreaties could prevail with him to proceed. It was ju&s;t recovering from this di&s;mal &s;itu|ation that I found them; but perceiving every thing &s;afe, I own their pre&s;ent mortification did not much di&s;|plea&s;e me, as it might give me many opportunities of fu|ture triumph and teach my daughters more humility.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The family &s;till re&s;olves to hold up their heads.</HEAD>
<P>ALLHALOWS eve happening on the next day, we were invited to burn nuts and play tricks at neighbour Flamborough's. Our late mortifications had humbled us a little, or it is probable we might have re|jected &s;uch an invitation with contempt: however, we &s;uffered our&s;elves to be happy. Our hone&s;t neighbour's goo&s;e and dumplings were fine, and the lamb's-wool, e|ven in the opinion of my wife, who was a connoi&s;&s;eur, was thought excellent. It is true, his manner of telling &s;tories was not quite &s;o well. They were very long, and very dull, and all about him&s;elf, and we had laugh|ed at them ten times before: however, we were kind enough to laugh at them once more.</P>
<P>Mr. Burchell, who was of the party, was always fond of &s;eeing &s;ome innocent amu&s;ement going forward, and &s;et the boys and girls to blind man's buff. My wife too was per&s;uaded to join in the diver&s;ion, and it gave me plea&s;ure to think &s;he was not yet too old. In the mean time, my neighbour and I looked on, laughed at every feat, and prai&s;ed our own dexterity when we were young. Hot cockles &s;ucceeded next, que&s;tions and commands followed that, and la&s;t of all, they &s;ate down to hunt the &s;lipper. As every per&s;on may not be accquainted with this primaeval pa&s;time, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the company at this play plant them&s;elves in a ring upon the ground, all, except one who &s;tands in the mid|dle, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to catch a &s;hoe, which the com|pany &s;hove about under their hams from one to another, &s;omething like a weaver's &s;huttle. As it is impo&s;&s;ible&punc; in this ca&s;e for the lady who is up to face all the company at once, the great beauty of the play lies in hitting her a thump with the heel of the &s;hoe on that &s;ide lea&s;t ca|pable of making a defence. It was in this manner that
<PB N="47" REF="012405_0046_0F8972BD73EEA998">
my elde&s;t daughter was hemmed in, and thumped about, all blowzed, in &s;pirits, and bawling for fair play, fair play, with a voice that might deafen a ballad &s;inger, when, confu&s;ion on confu&s;ion, who &s;hould enter the room but our two great acquaintances from town, Lady Blarny and Mi&s;s Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs! De&s;cription would but beggar, therefore it is unnece&s;|&s;ary to de&s;cribe this new mortification. Death! To be &s;een by ladies of &s;uch high breeding in &s;uch vulgar atti|tudes! Nothing better could en&s;ue from &s;uch a vulgar play of Mr. Flamborough's propo&s;ing. We &s;eemed &s;truck to the ground for &s;ome time, as if actually petrifi|ed with amazement.</P>
<P>The two ladies had been at our hou&s;e to &s;ee us, and finding us from home, came after us hither, as they were unea&s;y to know what accident could have kept us from church the day before. Olivia under|took to be our prolocutor, and delivered the whole in a &s;ummary way, only &s;aying, "We were thrown from our hor&s;es." At which account the ladies were greatly concerned: but being told the family received no hurt, they were extremely glad: but being informed that we were almo&s;t killed by the fright, they were va&s;t|ly &s;orrow; but hearing that we had a very good night, they were extremely glad again. Nothing could exceeed their complai&s;ance to my daughters; their profe&s;&s;ions the la&s;t evening were warm, but now they were ardent. They prote&s;ted a de&s;ire of having a more la&s;ting acquain|tance. Lady Blarny was particularly attached to Oli|via; Mi&s;s Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs (I love to give the whole name) took a greater fancy to her &s;i&s;ter. They &s;upported the conver&s;ation between them&s;elves while my daughters &s;ate &s;ilent, admiring their exalted breeding. But as every reader, however beggarly him|&s;elf is fond of high lived dialogues, with anecdotes of Lords, Ladies, and Knights of the Garter, I mu&s;t beg leave to give him the concluding part of the pre&s;ent con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"All that I know of the matter," cried Mi&s;s Skeggs, "is this, that it may be true, or it may not be true: but this I can a&s;&s;ure your Lady&s;hip, that the whole rout was in amaze; his Lord&s;hip turned all manner of colours,
<PB N="48" REF="012405_0047_0F8972BE329C2188">
my lady fell into a &s;woon; but Sir Tomkyn, drawing his &s;word, &s;wore he was her's to the la&s;t drop of his blood."</P>
<P>"Well replied our Peere&s;s, "this I can &s;ay, that the Dutche&s;s never told me a &s;yllable of the matter, and I believe her Grace would keep nothing a &s;ecret from me. But this you may depend upon as fact, that the next morning my Lord Duke cried out three times to his valet de chambre, Jernigan, Jernigan Jernigan, bring me my garters."</P>
<P>But previou&s;ly I &s;hould have mentioned the very im|polite behaviour of Mr. Burchell, who, during this di&s;|cour&s;e, &s;ate with his face turned to the fire, and at the conclu&s;ion of every &s;entence would cry out <HI>fudge,</HI> an ex|pre&s;&s;ion which di&s;plea&s;ed us all, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure damped the ri&s;ing &s;pirit of the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides, my dear Skeggs," continued our Peere&s;s, "there is nothing of this in the copy of ver&s;es that Dr. Burdock made upon the occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>"I am &s;urprized at that," cried Mi&s;s Skeggs; "for he &s;eldom leaves any thing out, as he writes only for his own amu&s;ement. But can your Lady&s;hip favour me with a &s;ight of them?"</P>
<P>"My dear creature," replied our Peere&s;s, "do you think I carry &s;uch things about me? Though they are very fine to be &s;ure, and I think my&s;elf &s;omething of a judge; at lea&s;t I know what plea&s;es my&s;elf. Indeed I was ever an admirer of all doctor Burdock's little pieces; for except what he does, and our dear Counte&s;s at Ha|nover-Square, there's nothing comes out but the mo&s;t lowe&s;t &s;tuff in nature; not a bit of high life among them."</P>
<P>"Your Lady&s;hip &s;hould except," &s;ays t'other, 'your own things in the Lady's Magazine. I hope you'll &s;ay there's nothing low lived there; but I &s;uppo&s;e we are to have no more from that quarter."</P>
<P>"Why, my dear," &s;ays the lady, "you know my reader and companion has left me, to be married to cap|tain Roach, and as my poor eyes won't &s;uffer me to write my&s;elf, I have been for &s;ome time looking out for ano|ther. A proper per&s;on is no ea&s;y matter to find, and to be &s;ure thirty pounds a year is a &s;mall &s;tipend for a well bred girl of character, that can read, write, and behave
<PB N="49" REF="012405_0048_0F8972BEF39D4990">
in company; as for the chits about town, there is no bearing them about one.</P>
<P>"That I know," cried Mi&s;s Skeggs, by experience. For of the three companions I had this la&s;t half year, one of them refu&s;ed to do plain work an hour in the day, another thought twenty-five guineas a year too &s;mall a &s;alary, and I was obliged to &s;end away the third, be|cau&s;e I &s;u&s;pected an intrigue with the chaplain. Virtue, my dear Lady Blarny, virtue is worth any price; but where is that to be found?"</P>
<P>My wife had been for a long time all attention to this di&s;cour&s;e; but was particularly &s;truck with the latter part of it. Thirty pounds and twenty-five guineas a year, made fifty-&s;ix pounds five &s;hillings Engli&s;h money, all which was in a manner going a-begging, and might ea|&s;ily be &s;ecured in the family. She for a moment &s;tudied my looks for approbation; and, to own a truth, I was of opinion, that two &s;uch places would fit our two daugh|ters exactly. Be&s;ides, if the 'Squire had any real affec|tion for my elde&s;t daughter, this would be the way to make her every way qualified for her fortune. My wife therefore was re&s;olved that we &s;hould not be deprived of &s;uch advantages for want of a&s;&s;urance, and undertook to harrangue for the family. "I hope," cried &s;he, your Lady&s;hips will pardon my pre&s;ent pre&s;umption. It is true, we have no right to pretend to &s;uch favours; but yet is natural for me to wi&s;h putting my children for|ward in the world. And I will be bold to &s;ay, my two girls have had a pretty good education, and capacity, at lea&s;t the country can't &s;hew better. They can read, write, and ca&s;t accompts; they under&s;tand their needle, bread&s;tich, cro&s;s and change, and all manner of plain work; they can pink, point, and frill; and know &s;ome|thing of mu&s;ic; they can make up &s;mall cloaths, work upon catgut; my elde&s;t can cut paper, and my younge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> has a very pretty manner of telling fortunes upon the cards&punc;</P>
<P>When &s;he had delivered this pretty piece of eloquence, the two ladies looked at each other a few minutes in &s;i|lence, with an air of doubt and importance. At l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Mi&s;s Carolina Wielmina Amelia Skeggs conde&s;cended to ob&s;erve, that the young ladies from the opinion &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> form of them from &s;o &s;light an accquaintance, &s;eem|ed

very fit for &s;uch employments: "But a thing of this kind, Madam," cried &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing my &s;pou&s;e, "re|quires a thorough examination into characters, and a more perfect knowledge of each other. Not Madam," continued &s;he, "that I in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect the young ladies virtue, prudence and di&s;cretion; but there is a form in the&s;e things, Madam, there is a form."</P>
<P>My wife approved her &s;u&s;picions very much, ob&s;erv|ing, that &s;he was very apt to be &s;u&s;picious her&s;elf; but referred her to all the neighbours for a character: but this our Peere&s;s declined as unnece&s;&s;ary, alledging that her cou&s;in Thornhill's recommendation would be &s;uffici|ent, and upon this we re&s;ted our petition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Fortune &s;eems re&s;olved to humble the family of Wake|field. Mortifications are often more painful than real calamities.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we were returned home, the night was dedicated to &s;chemes of future conque&s;t. De|borah exerted much &s;agacity in conjecturing which of the two girls was likely to have the be&s;t place, and mo&s;t op|portunities of &s;eeing good company. The only ob&s;tacle to our preferment was in obtaining the 'Squire's recom|mendation; but he had already &s;hewn us too many in|&s;tances of his friend&s;hip to doubt of it now. Even in bed my wife kept up the u&s;ual theme: "Well, faith, my dear Charles, between our&s;elves, I think we have made an excellent day's work of it."&mdash;"Pretty well,"&mdash; cried I, not knowing what to &s;ay.&mdash;"What, only pretty well!" returned &s;he. "I think it is very well.

<PB N="51" REF="012405_0050_0F8972C0730AC5C0">
Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs has my warm heart. But yet, when they came to talk of places in town, you &s;aw how at once&punc; I nailed them. Tell me, my dear, don't you think I did for my children there?&mdash;" Ay," returned I, not knowing well what to think of the mat|ter, heaven grant they may both be the better for it this day three months!" This was one of tho&s;e ob&s;erva|tions I u&s;ually made to impre&s;s my wife with an opinion of my &s;agacity; for if the girls &s;ucceeded, then it was a pious wi&s;h fulfilled: but if any thing unfortunate en|&s;ued, then it might be looked upon as a prophecy. All this conver&s;ation, however, was only preparatory to ano|ther &s;cheme, and indeed I dreaded as much. This was nothing le&s;s than, that as we were now to hold up our heads a little higher in the world, it would be proper to &s;ell the Colt, which was grown old, at a neighbouring fair, and buy us an hor&s;e that would carry &s;ingle or dou|ble upon an occa&s;ion, and make a pretty appearance at church or upon a vi&s;it. This at fir&s;t I oppo&s;ed &s;toutly; but it was as &s;toutly defended. However, as I weak|ened, my antagoni&s;t gained &s;trength, till at la&s;t it was re&s;olved to part with him.</P>
<P>As the fair happened on the following day, I had in|tentions of going my&s;elf; but my wife per&s;uaded me that I had got a cold, and nothing could prevail upon her to permit me from home. "No, my dear," &s;aid &s;he, "our &s;on Mo&s;es is a di&s;creet boy, and can buy and &s;ell to very good advantage; you know all our great bargains are of his purcha&s;ing. He always &s;tands out and higgles, and actually tires them till he gets a bargain."</P>
<P>As I had &s;ome opinion of my &s;on's prudence, I was willing enough to entru&s;t him with this commi&s;&s;ion, and the next morning I perceived his &s;i&s;ters mighty bu&s;y in fitting out Mo&s;es for the fair; trimming his hair, bru&s;h|ing his buckles, and cocking his hat with pins. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the toilet being over, we had at la&s;t the &s;a|tisfaction of &s;eeing him mounted upon the Colt, with a doal box before him to bring home groceries in. He had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder and lightening, which though grown too &s;hort, was much too good to be thrown away. His wai&s;tcoat was of go&s;ling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and his &s;i&s;ters had tied his hair with a broad black
<PB N="52" REF="012405_0051_0F8972C137CADE10">
riband. We all followed him &s;everal paces from the door, bawling after him good luck, good luck, till we could &s;ee no him longer.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce gone, when Mr. Thornhill's butler came to congratulate us upon our good fortune, &s;aying that he overheard his young ma&s;ter mention our names with great commendations.</P>
<P>Good fortune &s;eemed re&s;olved not to come alone. Another footman from the &s;ame family followed with a card for my daughters, importing, that the two ladies had received &s;uch a plea&s;ing account from Mr. Thorn|hill of us all, that after a few previous enquires more they hoped to be perfectly &s;atisfied. "Ay," cried my wife, "I now &s;ee it is no ea&s;y matter to get into the families of the great; but when one once gets in, then as Mo&s;es &s;ays, they may go &s;leep." To this piece of humour, for &s;he intended it for wit, my daughters a&s;&s;ented with a loud laugh of plea&s;ure. In &s;hort, &s;uch was her &s;atisfac|tion at this me&s;&s;age, that &s;he actually put her hand to her pocket, and gave the me&s;&s;enger &s;even pence halfpenny.</P>
<P>This was to be our vi&s;iting-day. The next that came was Mr. Burchell, who had been at the fair. He brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread each, which my wife undertook to keep for them, and gave them by letters at a time.. He brought my daughters al&s;o a couple of boxes, in which they might keep wafers, &s;nuff, patch|es or even mony, when they got it. My wife was u&s;u|ally fond of a wee&s;el &s;kin pur&s;e, as being the mo&s;t lucky; but this by the bye. We had &s;till a regard for Mr. Bur|chell, though his late rude behaviour was in &s;ome mea|&s;ure di&s;plea&s;ing: nor could we now avoid communicat|ing our happine&s;s to him, and a&s;king his advice: al|though we &s;eldom followed advice, we were all ready e|nough to a&s;k it. When he read the note from the two ladies, he &s;hook his head, and ob&s;erved, that an affair of this &s;ort demanded the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection.&mdash;This air of diffidence highly di&s;plea&s;ed my wife. "I never doubt|ed, Sir," cried &s;he, "your readine&s;s to be again&s;t my daughters and me. You have more circum&s;pection than is wanted. However, I fancy when we come to a&s;k ad|vice, we will apply to per&s;ons who &s;eem to have made u&s;e of it them&s;elves."&mdash;"Whatever my own cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="53" REF="012405_0052_0F8972C1F3BE1800">
may have been, madam," replied he, "is not the pre|&s;ent que&s;tion; though as I have made no u&s;e of advice my&s;elf, I &s;hould in con&s;cience give it to tho&s;e that will." &mdash;As I was apprehen&s;ive this an&s;wer might draw on a repartee, making up by abu&s;e what it wanted in wit, I changed the &s;ubject, by &s;eeming to wonder what could keep our &s;on &s;o long at the fair, as it was now almo&s;t night-fall.&mdash;Never mind our &s;on," cried my wife, de|pend upon it he knows what he is about. I'll warrant we'll never &s;ee him &s;ell his hen of a rainy day. I have &s;een him buy &s;uch bargains as would amaze one. I'll tell you a good &s;tory about that, that will make you &s;plit your &s;ides with laughing.&mdash;But as I live, yonder comes Mo&s;es, without an hor&s;e, and the box at his back."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, Mo&s;es came &s;lowly on foot, and &s;weat|ing under the deal box, which he had &s;trapt round his &s;houlders.&mdash;"Welcome, welcome Mo&s;es; well, my boy, what have you brought us from the fair?"&mdash;"I have brought you my&s;elf," cried Mo&s;es with a &s;ly look, and re&s;ting the box on the dre&s;&s;er.&mdash;"Ay Mo&s;es cri|ed my wife, that we know, but where is the hor&s;e?" "I have &s;old him," cried Mo&s;es, "for three pounds five &s;hillings and two-pence."&mdash;Well done, my good boy," returned &s;he, "I knew you would touch them off. Between our&s;elves, three pounds five &s;hillings and two-pence is no bad days work. Come, let us have it then."&mdash;"I have brought back no money," cried Mo&s;es, again. I have laid it all out in a bargain, and here it is," pulling a bundle from his brea&s;t: "here they are; a groce of green &s;pectacles, with &s;ilver rims and &s;hagreen ca&s;es."&mdash;"A groce of green &s;pectacles!" re|peated my wife in a faint voice. And you have part|ed with the Colt, and brought us back nothing but a groce of green paltry &s;pectacles!"&mdash;"Dear, mother," cried the boy, why won't you li&s;ten to rea&s;on? I had them a dead bargain, or I &s;hould not have bought them. The &s;ilver rims alone will &s;ell for double the money."&mdash; "A fig for the &s;ilver rims, cried my wife&punc; in a pa&s;&s;ion: "I dare &s;wear they won't &s;ell for above half the money at the rate of broken &s;ilver, five &s;hillings an ounce."&mdash; "You need be under no unea&s;ine&s;s," cried I, "about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lling the rims; for I perceive they are only copper
<PB N="54" REF="012405_0053_0F8972C2B1DA3CD0">
varni&s;hed over."&mdash;What," cried my wife, "not &s;ilver, the rims not &s;ilver!" "No," cried I, "no more &s;ilver than your &s;auce-pan."&mdash;"And &s;o," returned &s;he, we have parted with the Colt, and have only got a groce of green &s;pectacles, with copper rims and &s;hagreen ca&s;es! A murrain take &s;uch trumpery. The blockhead has been impo&s;ed upon, and &s;hould have known his company better."&mdash;"There, my dear," cried I, "you are wrong, he &s;hould not have known them at all."&mdash;"Marry, hang the ideot," returned &s;he again, "to bring me &s;uch &s;tuff, if I had them, I would throw them into the fire." "There again you are wrong, my dear," cried I "for though they be copper we will keep them by us, as cop|per &s;pectacles, you know, are better than nothing."</P>
<P>By this time the unfortunate Mo&s;es was undeceived. He now &s;aw that he had indeed been impo&s;ed upon by a prowling &s;harper, who ob&s;erving his figure, had mark|ed him for an ea&s;y prey. I therefore a&s;ked the circum|&s;tances of his deception. He &s;old the hor&s;e, it &s;eems and walked the fair in &s;earch of another. A reverend looking man brought him to a tent, under a pretence of having one to &s;ell. "Here," continued Mo&s;es, we met
<Q>another man, very well dre&s;t, who de&s;ired to borrow twenty pounds upon the&s;e, &s;aying, that he wanted money and would di&s;po&s;e of them for a third of the value. The fir&s;t gentleman, who pretended to be my friend, whi&s;pered me to buy them and cautioned me not to let &s;o good an offer pa&s;s. I &s;ent for Mr. Flam|borough, and they talked him up as finely as they did me, and &s;o at la&s;t we were per&s;uaded to buy the two groce between us.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Mr. Burchell is found to be an enemy; for he has the confidence to give di&s;agreeable advice.</HEAD>
<P>OUR family had now made &s;everal attempts to be fine; but &s;ome unfore&s;een di&s;a&s;ter demoli&s;hed each as &s;oon as projected. I endeavoured to take the advan|tage of every di&s;appointment, to improve their good &s;en&s;e in proportion as they were fru&s;trated in ambition. "You &s;ee, my children," cried I, "how little is to be got by attempts to impo&s;e upon the world, in coping with our betters. Such as are poor and will a&s;&s;ociate with none but the rich, are hated by tho&s;e they avoid, and de&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e they follow. Unequal combina|tions are always di&s;advantageous to the weaker &s;ide: the rich having the plea&s;ure, and the poor the inconvenien|cies that re&s;ult from them. But come, Dick, my boy, and repeat the fable that you were reading to-day, for the good of the company."</P>
<P>"Once upon a time," cried the child, "a Giant and a Dwarf were friends, and kept together. They made a bargain that they would never for&s;ake each other, but go &s;eek adventures. The fir&s;t battle they fought was with two Saracens, and the Dwarf, who was very cou|rageous, dealt one of the champions a mo&s;t angry blow. It did the Saracen but very little injury, who lifting up his &s;word fairly &s;truck off the poor Dwarf's arm. He was now in a woeful plight; but the Giant coming to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in a &s;hort time left the two Saracens dead on the plain, and the Dwarf cut off the dead man's head out of &s;pite. They then travelled on to another adven|ture. This was again&s;t three bloody minded Satyrs, who were carrying away a dam&s;el in di&s;tre&s;s. The Dwarf was not quite &s;o fierce now as before; but for all that, &s;truck the fir&s;t blow, which was returned by another,
<PB N="56" REF="012405_0055_0F8972C543920830">
that knocked out his eye: but the Giant was &s;oon up with them, and had they not fled, would certainly have killed them every one. They were all very joyful for this victory, and the dam&s;el who was relieved fell in love with the Giant, and married him. They now travelled far, and farther than I can tell, till they met with a company of robbers. The Giant, for the fir&s;t time, was foremo&s;t now: but the Dwarf was not far behind. The battle was &s;tout and long. Wherever the Giant came, all fell before him; but the Dwarf had like to have been killed more than once. At la&s;t the victory declared for the two adventurers; but the Dwarf lo&s;t his leg. The Dwarf was now without an arm, a leg, and an eye, while the Giant, who was without a &s;ingle wound, cri|ed out to him, Come on my little heroe; this is glorious &s;port; let us get one victory more, and then we &s;hall have honour for ever. No, cries the Dwarf, who was by this time grown wi&s;er, no, I declare off, I'll fight no more: for I find in every battle, that you get all the ho|nour and rewards, but all the blows fall upon me."</P>
<P>I was going to moralize this fable, when our attention was called off to a warm di&s;pute between my wife and Mr. Burchell, upon my daughter's intended expedition to town. My wife very &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon the ad|vantages that would re&s;ult from it. Mr. Burchell, on the contrary, di&s;&s;uaded her with great ardor, and I &s;tood neuter. His pre&s;ent di&s;&s;ua&s;ions &s;eemed but the &s;econd part of tho&s;e which were received with &s;o ill a grace in the morning. The di&s;pute grew high, while poor De|borah, in&s;tead of rea&s;oning &s;tronger, talked louder, and at la&s;t was obliged to take &s;helter from a defeat in cla|mour. The conclu&s;ion of her harangue, however, was highly di&s;plea&s;ing to us all: &s;he knew &s;he &s;aid, of &s;ome who had their own &s;ecret rea&s;ons for what they advi&s;ed; but, for her part, &s;he wi&s;hed &s;uch to &s;tay away from her hou&s;e for the future.&mdash;"Madam," cried Burchell, with looks of great compo&s;ure, which tended to enflame her the more, "as for &s;ecret rea&s;ons, you are right: I have &s;ecret rea&s;ons, which I forbear to mention, becau&s;e you are not able to an&s;wer tho&s;e of which I make no &s;e|cret: but I find my vi&s;its here are become trouble&s;ome&punc; I'll take my leave therefore now, and perhaps come once
<PB N="57" REF="012405_0056_0F8972C5B2BDF5B0">
more to take a final farewell, when I am quitting the country." Thus &s;aying, he took up his hat, nor could the attempts of Sophia, who&s;e looks &s;eemed to upbraid his precipitancy, prevent his going.</P>
<P>When gone, we all regarded each other for &s;ome mi|nutes with confu&s;ion. My wife, who knew her&s;elf to be the cau&s;e, &s;trove to hide her concern with a forced &s;mile, and an air of a&s;&s;urance, which I was willing to reprove: "How, woman," cried I to her, "is it thus we treat &s;trangers? Is it thus we return their kindne&s;s? Be a&s;&s;ured, my dear, that the&s;e were the har&s;he&s;t words, and to me the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing that ever e&s;caped your lips!&mdash;"Why would he provoke me then," replied &s;he, "but I know the motives of his advice perfectly well. He would prevent my girls from going to town, that he may have the plea&s;ure of my younge&s;t daughter's company here at home. But whatever happens, &s;he &s;hall chu&s;e better company than &s;uch low-liv'd fellows as he."&mdash;"Low-liv'd, my dear, do you call him," cried I, "it is very po&s;&s;ible we may mi&s;take this man's cha|racter: for he &s;eems upon &s;ome occa&s;ions the mo&s;t fini&s;h|ed gentleman I ever knew.&mdash;Tell me, Sophia, my girl, has he ever given you any &s;ecret in&s;tances of his attachment?"&mdash;"His conver&s;ation with me, Sir," replied my daughter, "has ever been &s;en&s;ible, mode&s;t, and plea&s;ing. As to aught el&s;e, no, never. Once, in|deed, I remember to have heard him &s;ay, he never knew a woman who could find merit in a man that &s;eemed poor." "Such, my dear," cried I, "is the common cant of all the unfortunate or idle. But I hope you have been taught to judge properly of &s;uch men, and that it would be even madne&s;s to expect happine&s;s from one who has been &s;o very bad an oeconomi&s;t of his own. Your mother and I have now better pro&s;pects for you. The next winter, which you will probably &s;pend in town, will give you opportunities of making a more prudent choice."</P>
<P>What Sophia's reflections were upon this occa&s;ion, I can't pretend to determine; but I was not di&s;plea&s;ed at the bottom, that we were rid of a gue&s;t from whom I had much to fear. Our breach of ho&s;pitality went
<PB N="58" REF="012405_0057_0F8972C6723B8EE0">
to my con&s;cience a little: but I quickly &s;ilenced that monitor, by two or three &s;pecious rea&s;ons, which &s;erved to &s;atisfy and reconcile me to my&s;elf. The pain which con&s;cience gives the man who has already done wrong, is &s;oon got over. Con&s;cience is a coward, and tho&s;e faults it has not &s;trength enough to prevent, it &s;el|dom has ju&s;tice enough to puni&s;h by accu&s;ing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Fre&s;h mortifications, or a demon&s;tration that &s;eeming ca|lamities may be real ble&s;&s;ings.</HEAD>
<P>THE journey of my daughters to town was now re&s;olved upon, Mr. Thornhill having kindly pro|mi&s;ed to in&s;pect their conduct him&s;elf, and inform us by letter of their behaviour. But it was thought indi&s;pen|&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary that their appearance &s;hould equal the greatne&s;s of their expectations, which could not be done without &s;ome expence. We debated therefore in full council, what were the ea&s;ie&s;t methods of rai&s;ing money, or, more properly &s;peaking, what we could mo&s;t conve|niently &s;ell. The deliberation was &s;oon fini&s;hed, it was found that our remaining hor&s;e was utterly u&s;ele&s;s for the plow, without his companion, and equally unfit for the road, as wanting an eye. It was therefore deter|mined that we &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of him for the purpo&s;es a|bove-mentioned, at the neighbouring fair, and to prevent impo&s;ition, that I &s;hould go with him my&s;elf. Though this was one of the fir&s;t mercantile tran&s;actions of my life, yet I had no doubt about acquitting my&s;elf with re|putation. The opinion a man forms of his own prudence is mea&s;ured by that of the company he keeps, and as mine was mo&s;tly in the family way, I had conceived no unfavourable &s;entiments of my worldly wi&s;dom. My wife, however, next morning, at parting, after I had
<PB N="59" REF="012405_0058_0F8972C7342993A0">
got &s;ome paces from the door, called me back, to ad|vi&s;e me, in a whi&s;per, to have all my eyes about me.</P>
<P>I had, in the u&s;ual forms, when I came to the fair, put my hor&s;e through all his his paces; but for &s;ome time had no bidders. At la&s;t a chapman ap|proached, and after he had for a good while exa|mined the hor&s;e round, finding him blind of one eye, would have nothing to &s;ay to him: a &s;econd came up; but ob&s;erving he had a &s;pavin, declared he would not take him for the driving home: a third perceiv|ed he had a windgall, and would bid no money: a fourth knew by his eye, that he had the botts: a fifth, more impertinent than all the re&s;t, wondered what a plague I could do to the fair with a blind, &s;pavined, galled hack, that was only fit to be cut up for a dog kennel. By this time, I began to have a mo&s;t hearty contempt for the poor animal my&s;elf, and was almo&s;t a&s;hamed at the approach of every new cu&s;|tomer; for though I did not entirely believe all the fel|lows told me; yet I reflected that the number of witne&s;|&s;es was a &s;trong pre&s;umption they were right, and St. Gregory, upon good works, profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>I was in this mortifying &s;ituation, when a brother clergyman, an old acquaintance, who had al&s;o bu&s;i|ne&s;s to the fair, came up, and &s;haking me by the hand, propo&s;ed adjourning to a public-hou&s;e, and ta|king a gla&s;s of whatever we could get. I readily clo&s;ed with the offer, and entering an ale-hou&s;e, we were &s;hewn into a little back room, where there was only a venerable old man, who &s;at wholly intent o|ver a large book, which he was reading. I never in my life &s;aw a figure that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me more fa|vourably. His locks of &s;ilver grey venerably &s;haded his temples, and his green old age &s;eemed to be the re&s;ult of health and benevolence. However, his pre|&s;ence did not interrupt our conver&s;ation; my friend and I di&s;cour&s;ed on the various turns of fortune we had met: the Whi&s;tonian controver&s;y, my la&s;t pam|phlet, the archdeacon's reply, and the hard mea&s;ure that was dealt me. But our attention was in a &s;hort
<PB N="60" REF="012405_0059_0F8972C7F2F83BA8">
time taken off by the appearance of a youth, who, entering the room, re&s;pectfully &s;aid &s;omething &s;oftly to the old &s;tranger. "Make no apologies, my child," &s;aid the old man, "to do good is a duty we owe to all our fellow creatures: take this, I wi&s;h it were more: but five pounds will relieve your di&s;tre&s;s, and you are welcome." The mode&s;t youth &s;hed tears of gratitude, and yet his gratitude was &s;carce equal to mine. I could have hugged the good old man in my arms, his benevo|lence plea&s;ed me &s;o. He continued to read, and we re|&s;umed our conver&s;ation, until my companion, after &s;ome time, recollecting that he had bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act in the fair, promi&s;ed to be &s;oon back; adding, that he always de&s;ired to have as much of Dr. Primro&s;e's company as po&s;&s;ible. The old gentleman hearing my name mention|ed, &s;eemed to look at me with attention, and when my friend was gone, mo&s;t re&s;pectfully demanded if I was any way related to the great Primro&s;e, that couragious monogami&s;t, who had been the bulwark of the church. Never did my heart feel &s;incerer rapture than at that mo|ment. "Sir," cried I, "the applau&s;e of &s;o good a man, as I am &s;ure you are, adds to that happine&s;s in my brea&s;t which your benevolence has already excited. You behold before you, Sir, that Doctor Primro&s;e, the monogami&s;t, whom you have been plea&s;ed to call great. You here &s;ee that unfortunate Divine, who has &s;o long, and it would ill become me to &s;ay, &s;ucce&s;sfully, fought again&s;t the deuterogamy of the age." "Sir," cried the &s;tranger, &s;truck with awe, "I fear I have been too fa|miliar; but you'll forgive my curio&s;ity, Sir: I beg par|don." "Sir," cried I, gra&s;ping his hand, "you are &s;o far from di&s;plea&s;ing me by your familiarity, that I mu&s;t beg you'll accept my friend&s;hip, as you already have all my e&s;teem."&mdash;"Then with gratitude I accept the offer," cried he, &s;queezing me by the hand, "thou glorious pil|lar of un&s;haken orthodoxy; and do I behold&mdash;I here interrupted what he was going to &s;ay; for tho', as an author, I could dige&s;t no &s;mall &s;hare of flattery, yet now my mode&s;ty would permit no more. However, no lov|ers in romance ever cemented a more in&s;tantaneous friend|&s;hip. We talked upon &s;everal &s;ubjects: at fir&s;t I thought he &s;eemed rather devout than learned, and began to think
<PB N="61" REF="012405_0060_0F8972C8B3958D18">
he de&s;pi&s;ed all human doctrines as dro&s;s. Yet this no way le&s;&s;ened him in my e&s;teem; for I had for &s;ome time begun privately to harbour &s;uch an opinion my&s;elf. I therefore took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve that the world in general began to be blameably indifferent as to doctrinal matters, and followed human &s;peculations too much.&mdash; "Ay, Sir," replied he, as if he had re&s;erved all his learning to that moment, "Ay, Sir, the world is in its dotage, and yet the co&s;mogany or creation of the world has puzzled philo&s;ophers of all ages. What a medly of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world? Sanconiathon, Manetho, Bero&s;us, and Ocellus Lucanus, have all attempted it in vain. The latter has the&s;e words, <HI>Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan,</HI> which imply that all things have neither beginning nor end. Manetho al&s;o, who lived about the time of Nebuchadon-A&s;&s;er, A&s;&s;er being a Syriac word, u&s;ually applied as a &s;urname to the kings of that country, as Teglat Phael-A&s;&s;er, Nabon-A&s;&s;er, he, I &s;ay, formed a conjecture e|qually ab&s;urd; for as we u&s;ually &s;ay, <HI>ek to bib lion ku|bernetes,</HI> which implies, that books will never teach the world; &s;o he attempted to inve&s;tigate&mdash;But, Sir, I a&s;k pardon, I am &s;traying from the que&s;tion."&mdash;That he actually was; nor could I for my life &s;ee how the creation of the world had any thing to do with the bu&s;i|ne&s;s I was talking of, but it was &s;ufficient to &s;hew me, that he was a man of letters, and I now reverenced him the more. I was re&s;olved therefore to bring him to the touch-&s;tone; but he was too mild and too gentle to con|tend for victory. Whenever I made any ob&s;ervation that looked like a challenge to controver&s;y, he would &s;mile, &s;hake his head, and &s;ay nothing; by which I under&s;tood he could &s;ay much, if he thought proper. The &s;ubject therefore in&s;en&s;ibly changed from the bu&s;ine&s;s of anti|quity to that which brought us both to the fair; mine, I told him, was to &s;ell an hor&s;e, and very luckily, indeed, his was to buy one for one of his tenants. My hor&s;e was &s;oon produced, and in fine we &s;truck a bargain. Nothing now remained but to pay me, and he according|ly pulled out a thirty pound note, and bid me change it. Not being in a capacity of complying with his demand, he ordered the landlady to call up his footman, who
<PB N="62" REF="012405_0061_0F8972C9724BCF08">
made his appearance in a very genteel livery. "Here, Abraham," cried he, "go and get gold for this; you'll do it at neighbour Jack&s;on's, or any where." While the fellow was gone, he entertained we with a pathetic harrangue on the great &s;carcity of &s;ilver, which I under|took to improve, by deploring al&s;o the great &s;carcity of gold; and by the time Abraham returned, we had both agreed that money was never &s;o hard to be come at as now. Abraham returned to inform us, that he had been over the whole fair and could not get change, though he had offered half a crown for doing it. This was a very great di&s;appointment to us all; but the old gentleman having pau&s;ed a little, a&s;ked me if I knew one Solomon Flamborough in my part of the country: upon replying that he was my next door neighbour, "If that be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e then," returned he, "I believe we &s;hall deal. You &s;hall have a draught upon him, payable at &s;ight; and let me tell you, he is as warm a man as any within five miles round him. Hone&s;t Solomon and I have been acquaint|ed for many years together. I remember, I always beat him at three jumps; but he could hop upon one leg farther than I." A draught upon my neighbour was to me the &s;ame as money; for I was &s;ufficiently convinced of his ability: the draught was &s;igned and put into my hands, and Mr. Jenkin&s;on, the old gentleman, his man Abraham, and my hor&s;e, old Blackberry, trotted off very well plea&s;ed with each other.</P>
<P>Being now left to reflection, I began to recollect that I had done wrong in taking a draught from a &s;tranger, and &s;o prudently re&s;olved upon having back my hor&s;e, and following the purcha&s;er. But this was now too late: I therefore made directly homewards, re&s;olving to get the draught changed into money at my friend's as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. I found my hone&s;t neighbour &s;moaking his pipe at his own door, and informing him that I had a &s;mall bill upon him, he read it twice over. "You can read the name, I &s;uppo&s;e," cried I, "Ephraim Jenkin&s;on." Yes, returned he, "the name is written plain enough, and I know the gentleman too, the greate&s;t ra&s;cal under the canopy of heaven. This is the very &s;ame rogue who &s;old us the &s;pectacles. Was he not a venerable look|ing
<PB N="63" REF="012405_0062_0F8972CA37AD43F0">
man, with grey hair, and no flaps to his pocket-holes? And did he not talk a long &s;tring of learning a|bout Greek and co&s;mogony and the world?" To this I replied with a groan. "Aye," continued he, "he has but that one piece of learning in the world, and he al|ways talks it away whenever he finds a &s;cholar in com|pany: but I know the rogue, and will catch him yet."</P>
<P>Though I was already &s;ufficiently mortified, my great|e&s;t &s;truggle was to come, in facing my wife and daugh|ters. No truant was ever more afraid of returning to &s;chool, there to behold the ma&s;ter's &s;weet vi&s;age, than I was of going home. I was determined, however, to anticipate their fury, by fir&s;t falling into a pa&s;&s;ion my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>But, alas! upon entering, I found the family no way di&s;po&s;ed for battle. My wife and girls were all in tears, Mr. Thornhill having been there that day to inform them, that their journey to town was entirely over: The two ladies having heard reports of us from &s;ome malici|ous per&s;on about us, were that day &s;et out for London. He could neither di&s;cover the tendency, nor the author of the&s;e: but whatever they might be, or whoever might have broached them, he continued to a&s;&s;ure our family of his friend&s;hip and protection. I found, there|fore, that they bore my di&s;appointment with great re&s;ig|nation, as it was eclip&s;ed in the greatne&s;s of their own. But what perplexed us mo&s;t was to think, who could be &s;o ba&s;e as to a&s;per&s;e the character of a family &s;o harmle&s;s as ours, too humble to excite envy, and too inoffen&s;ive to create di&s;gu&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. All Mr. Burchell's villainy at once detected. The folly of being over-wi&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THAT evening and a part of the following day was employed in fruitle&s;s attempts to di&s;cover our enemies: &s;carce a family in the neighbourhood but in|curred our &s;u&s;picions, and each of us had rea&s;ons for our
<PB N="64" REF="012405_0063_0F8972CBC3313AF0">
opinion be&s;t known to our&s;elves. As we were in this perplexity, one of our little boys, who had been playing abroad, brought in a letter-ca&s;e, which he found on the green. It was quickly known to belong to Mr. Burchell, with whom it had been &s;een, and, upon examination, contained &s;ome hints upon different &s;ubjects; but what particularly engaged our attention, was a &s;ealed note, &s;uper&s;cribed, <HI>The Copy of a Letter to be &s;ent to the two Ladies at Thornhill-Ca&s;tle.</HI> It in&s;tantly occured, that he was the ba&s;e informer, and we deliberated whether the note &s;hould not be broke open. I was again&s;t it; but Sophia, who &s;aid &s;he was &s;ure, that of all men, he would be the la&s;t to be guilty of &s;o much ba&s;ene&s;s, in&s;i&s;t|ed upon its being read. In this &s;he was &s;econded by the re&s;t of the family, and, at their joint &s;olicitation, I read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE bearer will &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy you as to the per&s;on from whom this comes: one at lea&s;t the friend of innocence, and ready to prevent its being &s;e|duced. I am informed for a truth, that you have &s;ome intentions of bringing two young ladies to town, whom I have &s;ome knowledge of, under the character of com|panions. As I would neither have &s;implicity impo&s;ed upon, nor virtue contaminated. I mu&s;t offer it as my opinion, that the impropriety of &s;uch a &s;tep will be at|tended with dangerous con&s;equences. It has never been my way to treat the infamous or the lewd with &s;everity; nor &s;hould I now have taken this method of explaining my&s;elf or reproving folly, did it not aim at guilt. Take therefore the admonition of a friend, and &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on the con&s;equences of introducing infamy and vice into retreats where peace and innocence have hitherto re&s;ided.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Our doubts were now at an end. There &s;eemed indeed &s;omething applicable to both &s;ides in this letter, and its cen&s;ures might as well be referred to tho&s;e to whom it was written, as to us; but the malicious meaning was obvious, and we went no farther. My wife had &s;carce patience to hear me to the end, but railed at the writer with unre&s;trained re&s;entment, Olivia was equally &s;evere,
<PB N="65" REF="012405_0064_0F8972CCB475FA38">
and Sophia &s;eemed perfectly amazed at his ba&s;ene&s;s. As for my part, it appeared to me one of the vile&s;t in&s;tances of unprovoked ingratitude I had met with. Nor could I account for it in any other manner, than by imputing it to his de&s;ire of detaining my younge&s;t daughter in the country, to have the more frequent opportunities of an interview. In this manner we all &s;ate ruminating upon &s;chemes of vengeance, when our other little boy came running in to tell us that Mr. Burchell was approaching at the other end of the field. It is ea&s;ier to conceive than de&s;cribe the complicated &s;en&s;ations which are felt from the pain of a recent injury, and the plea&s;ure of approach|ing revenge. Though our intentions were only to up|braid him with his ingratitude; yet it was re&s;olved to do it in a manner that would be perfectly cutting. For this purpo&s;e we agreed to meet him with our u&s;ual &s;miles, to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary kindne&s;s, to amu&s;e him a little; but then in the mid&s;t of the flat|tering calm to bur&s;t upon him like an earthquake, and overwhelm him with the &s;en&s;e of his own ba&s;ene&s;s. This being re&s;olved upon, my wife undertook to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s her&s;elf, as &s;he really had &s;ome talents for &s;uch an undertaking. We &s;aw him approach, he entered, drew a chair, and &s;ate down.&mdash;"A fine day, Mr. Burchell." "A very fine day, Doctor; though I fancy we &s;hall have &s;ome rain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;hooting of my corns."&mdash;"The &s;hooting of your horns," cried my wife, in a loud fit of laughter, and then a&s;ked pardon for being fond of a joke.&mdash;"Dear madam," replied he, "I pardon you with all my heart; for I prote&s;t I &s;hould not have thought it a joke till you told me."&mdash;" Perhaps not, Sir," cried my wife, "wink|ing at us, and yet I dare &s;ay you can tell us how many jokes go to an ounce."&mdash;"I fancy, madam,," returned Bur|chell, "you have been reading a je&s;t book this morning, that ounce of jokes is &s;o very good a conceit; and yet, madam, I had rather &s;ee half an ounce of under&s;tanding," &mdash;"I believe you might," cried my wife, &s;till &s;miling at us, tho' the laugh was again&s;t her; "and yet I have &s;een &s;ome men pretend to under&s;tanding that have very little." "And no doubt," replied her antagoni&s;t, "you have known ladies &s;et up for wit that had none."&mdash;I quickly began to find that my wife was likely to gain but little at

this bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o I re&s;olved to treat him in a &s;tile of more &s;everity my&s;elf. "Both wit and under&s;tanding," cried I, "are trifles, without integrity: it is that which gives value to every character. The ignorant pea&s;ant, without fault, is greater than the philo&s;opher with many; for what is genius or courage without an heart? <HI>An hone&s;t man is the noble&s;t work of God.</HI>"</P>
<P>"I always held that favourite maxim of Pope," re|turned Mr. Burchell, "as very unworthy a man of ge|nius, and a ba&s;e de&s;ertion of his own &s;uperiority. As the reputation of books is rai&s;ed not by their freedom from defect, but the greatne&s;s of their beauties; &s;o &s;hould that of men be prized, not for their exemption from fault, but the &s;ize of tho&s;e virtues they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The &s;cholar may want prudence, the &s;tate&s;man may have pride, and the champion ferocity; but &s;hall we prefer to the&s;e men the low mechanic, who laboriou&s;ly plods on through life, without cen&s;ure or applau&s;e? We might as well prefer the tame correct paintings of the Flemi&s;h &s;chool to the erroneous, but &s;ublime animations of the Roman pencil."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied I, "your pre&s;ent ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t, when there are &s;hining virtues and minute defects; but when it appears that great vices are oppo&s;ed in the &s;ame mind to as extraordinary virtues, &s;uch a character de|&s;erves contempt."</P>
<P>"Perhaps," cried he, "there may be &s;ome &s;uch mon|&s;ters as you de&s;cribe, of great vices joined to great vir|tues; yet in my progre&s;s through life, I never yet found one in&s;tance of their exi&s;tence: on the contrary, I have ever perceived, that where the mind was capacious, the affections were good. And indeed, Providence &s;eems kindly our friend in this particular, thus to debilitate the under&s;tanding where the heart is corrupt, and dimini&s;h the power where there is the will to do mi&s;chief. This rule &s;eems to extend even to other animals: the little vermin race are ever treacherous, cruel, and cowardly, whil&s;t tho&s;e endowed with &s;trength and power are gene|rous, brave, and gentle."</P>
<P>"The&s;e ob&s;ervations found well," returned I, "and yet it would be ea&s;y this moment to point out a man," and I fixed my eye &s;tedfa&s;tly upon him," who&s;e head and heart

Do you know this, Sir, this pocket-book?"&mdash;"Yes, Sir" returned he with a face of impenetrable a&s;&s;urance, "that pocket-book is mine, and I am glad you have found it."&mdash; "And do you know," cried I, "this letter? Nay, ne|ver falter, man; but look me full in the face: I &s;ay, do you know this letter?"&mdash;"That letter returned he, "yes, it was I that wrote that letter."&mdash;"And how could you," &s;aid I, &s;o ba&s;ely, &s;o ungratefully pre&s;ume to write this letter?"&mdash;"And how came you," replied he, with looks of unparallelled effrontry, "&s;o ba&s;ely to pre&s;ume to break open this letter? Don't you know, now I could hang you all for this? All that I have to do, is to &s;wear at the next ju&s;tice's, that you have been guilty of breaking open the lock of my pocket book, and &s;o hang you all up at his door." This piece of unexpected in&s;olence, rai&s;ed me to &s;uch a pitch, that I could &s;carce govern my pa&s;&s;ion. "Ungrateful wretch, begone, and no longer pollute my dwelling with thy ba&s;ene&s;s. Begone, and never let me &s;ee thee again; go from my doors, and the only puni&s;hment I wi&s;h thee, is an alarmed con&s;cience, which will be a &s;ufficient tormentor! &s;o &s;aying, I threw him his pocket-book, which he took up with a &s;mile, and &s;hutting the cla&s;ps with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, left us, quite a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;erenity of his a&s;&s;urance. My wife was particularly enraged that nothing could make him angry, or make him &s;eem a&s;hamed of his villainies, "My dear," cried I, willing to calm tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions that had been rai&s;ed too high among us, we are not to be &s;urpri&s;ed that bad men want &s;hame; they only blu&s;h at being detected in doing good, but glory in their vices."</P>
<P>"Guilt and &s;hame &s;ays the allegory, were at fir&s;t com|panions, and in the beginning of their journey in&s;e|parably kept together. But their union was &s;oon found to be di&s;agreeable and inconvenient to both; guilt gave &s;hame frequent unea&s;ine&s;s&punc; and &s;hame often betrayed the &s;ecret con&s;piracies of guilt.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. The family u&s;e art which is oppo&s;ed with &s;till greater.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER might have been Sophia's &s;en&s;ations, the re&s;t of the family was ea&s;ily con&s;oled for Mr. Burchell's ab&s;ence, by the company of our landlord, who&s;e vi&s;its now became more frequent and longer. Though he had been di&s;appointed in procuring my daughters the amu&s;ements of the town, as he de&s;igned, he took every opportunity of &s;upplying them with tho&s;e little recreations which our retirement would admit of. He u&s;ually came in the morning, and while my &s;on and I followed our occupations abroad, he &s;at with the fa|mily at home, and amu&s;ed them by de&s;cribing the town, with every part of which he was particularly acquainted. He could repeat all the ob&s;ervations that were retailed in the atmo&s;phere of the play hou&s;es, and had all the good things of the high wits by rote, long before they made way into the je&s;t books. The intervals between conver&s;ation were employed in teaching my daughters pi|quet, or &s;ometimes in &s;etting my two little ones to box, to make them <HI>&s;harp,</HI> as he called it: but the hopes of having him for a &s;on-in-law, in &s;ome mea&s;ure blinded us to all his defects. It mu&s;t be owned, that my wife laid a thou&s;and &s;chemes to entrap him, or, to &s;peak it more tenderly, u&s;ed every art to magnify the merit of her daughter. If the cakes at tea eat &s;hort and cri&s;p, they were made by Olivia: if the goo&s;eberry wine was well
<PB N="69" REF="012405_0068_0F8972CF7396ECA8">
knit, the goo&s;eberries were of her gathering: it was her fingers gave the pickles their peculiar green; and in the compo&s;ition of a pudding, her judgment was infalli|ble. Then the poor woman would &s;ometimes tell the 'Squire, that &s;he thought him and Olivia extremely like each other, and would bid both &s;tand up to &s;ee which was talle&s;t. The&s;e in&s;tances of cunning, which &s;he thought impenetrable, yet which every body &s;aw thro' were very plea&s;ing to our benefactor, who gave every day &s;ome new proofs of his pa&s;&s;ion, which though they had not ari&s;en to propo&s;als of marriage, yet we thought fell but little &s;hort of it; and his &s;lowne&s;s was attributed &s;ometimes to native ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and &s;ometimes to his fear of offending a rich uncle. An occurrence, however, which happened &s;oon after, put it beyond a doubt, that he de&s;igned to become one of the family, my wife even regarded it as an ab&s;olute promi&s;e.</P>
<P>My wife and daughters happening to return a vi&s;it to neighbour Flamborough's, found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by a limner, who travelled the country, and did them for fifteen &s;hillings a head. As this family and ours had long a &s;ort of rivalry in point of ta&s;te, our &s;pirit took the alarm at this &s;tolen march up|on us, and notwith&s;tanding all I could &s;ay, and I &s;aid much, it was re&s;olved that we &s;hould have our pictures done too. Having, therefore, engaged the limner, for what could I do? Our next deliberation was to &s;hew the &s;uperiority of our ta&s;te in the attitudes. As for our neighbour's family, there were &s;even of them, and they were drawn with &s;even oranges, a thing quite out of ta&s;te, no variety in life, no compo&s;ition in the world. We de&s;ired to have &s;omething done in a brighter &s;tyle and, after many debates, at length came to an unanimous re|&s;olution to be drawn together, in one large hi&s;torical fa|mily-piece. This would be cheaper, &s;ince one frame would &s;erve for all, and it would be infinitely more gen|teel; for all families of any ta&s;te were now drawn in the &s;ame manner. As we did not immediately recollect an hi&s;torical &s;ubject to hit us, we were contented each with being drawn as independant hi&s;torical figures. My wife de&s;ired to be repre&s;ented as Venus, with a &s;tomacher richly &s;et with diamonds, and her two little ones as Cu|pids
<PB N="70" REF="012405_0069_0F8972D0333CC688">
by her &s;ide, while I, in my gown and band, was to pre&s;ent her with my books on the Bangorean controver&s;y. Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon, &s;itting upon a bank of flowers, dre&s;t in a green jo&s;eph, laced with gold, and a whip in her hand. Sophia was to be a &s;hepher|de&s;s with as many &s;heep as the painter could &s;pare; and Mo&s;es was to be dre&s;t out with an hat and white fea|ther. Our ta&s;te &s;o much plea&s;ed the 'Squire, that he in|&s;i&s;ted on being put in as one of the family, in the charac|ter of Alexander the Great at Olivia's feet. This was con&s;idered by us all as an indication of his de&s;ire to be in|troduced into the family in reality&punc; nor could we refu&s;e his reque&s;t. The painter was therefore &s;et to work, and as he wrought with a&s;&s;iduity and expedition, in le&s;s than four days the whole was compleated. The piece was large, and it mu&s;t be owned he did not &s;pare his colours; for which my wife gave him great encomiums. We were all perfectly &s;atisfied with his performance; but an unfortunate circum&s;tance had not occured till the pic|ture was fini&s;hed, which now &s;truck us with di&s;may. It was &s;o very large, that we had no place in the hou&s;e to fix it. How we all came to di&s;regard &s;o material a point is inconceivable; but certain it is, we were this time all greatly over &s;een. In&s;tead therefore of gratify|ing our vanity as we hoped, there it leaned, in a mo&s;t mortifying manner, again&s;t the kitchen wall, where the canvas was &s;tretched and painted, much too large to be got through any of the doors, and the je&s;t of all our neighbours. One compared it to Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe's long-boat, too large to be removed; another thought it more re&s;embled a reel in a bottle; &s;ome wondered how it &s;hould be got out, and &s;till more were amazed how it ever got in.</P>
<P>But though it excited the ridicule of &s;ome, it effectu|ally rai&s;ed more ill-natured &s;ugge&s;tions in many. The 'Squire's portrait being found united with ours, was an honour too great to e&s;cape envy. Malicious whi&s;pers began to circulate at our expence, and our tranquillity continually to be di&s;turbed by per&s;ons who came as friends to tell us what was &s;aid of us by enemies. The&s;e reports we always re&s;ented with becoming &s;pirit; but &s;candal ever improves by oppo&s;ition. We again there|fore
<PB N="71" REF="012405_0070_0F8972D0F7909430">
entered into a con&s;ultation upon obviating the ma|lice of our enemies and at la&s;t came to a re&s;olution which had too much cunning to give me entire &s;atisfac|tion. It was this: as our principal object was to di&s;co|ver the honour of Mr. Thornhill's addre&s;&s;es, my wife undertook to &s;ound him, by pretending to a&s;k his advice in the choice of an hu&s;band for her elde&s;t daughter. If this was not found &s;ufficient to induce him to a declara|tion, it was then fixed upon to terrify him with a rival, which it was thought would compel him, though never &s;o refractory. To this la&s;t &s;tep, however, I would by no means give my con&s;ent, till Olivia gave me the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn a&s;&s;urances, that &s;he would marry the per&s;on pro|vided to rival him upon this occa&s;ion, if Mr. Thornhill did not prevent it by taking her him&s;elf. Such was the &s;cheme laid, which though I did not &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;e, I did not entirely approve.</P>
<P>The next time, therefore that Mr. Thornhill came to &s;ee us, my girls took care to be out of the way, in order to give their mama an opportunity of putting her &s;cheme in execution; but they only retired to the next room, from whence they could over-hear the whole con|ver&s;ation; which my wife artfully introduced, by ob|&s;erving that one of the Mi&s;s Flamboroughs was likely to have a very good match of it in Mr. Spanker. To this the 'Squire a&s;&s;enting, &s;he proceeded to remark, that they who had warm fortunes were always &s;ure of getting good hu&s;bands: "But heaven help," continued &s;he, "the girls that have none. What &s;ignifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what &s;ignifies all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the world, in this age of &s;elf-intere&s;t? It is not, what is &s;he? but what has &s;he? is all the cry."</P>
<P>"Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the ju&s;|tice, as well as the novelty, of your remarks, and if I were a king, it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e. It would then, indeed, be fine times with the girls without fortunes: our two young ladies &s;hould be the fir&s;t for whom I would provide."</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir!" returned my wife, "you are plea&s;ed to be facetious: but I wi&s;h I were a queen, and then I know where they &s;hould look for an hu&s;band. But now that you have put it into my head, &s;eriou&s;ly Mr. Thornhill, can't
<PB N="72" REF="012405_0071_0F8972D1B1BF0FC8">
you recommend me a proper hu&s;band for my elde&s;t girl? She is now nineteen years old, well grown and well edu|cated, and in my humble opinion, does not want for parts."</P>
<P>Madam, replied he, "if I were to chu&s;e, I would find out a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every accompli&s;hment that can make an angel happy. One with prudence, fortune, ta&s;te, and &s;incerity, &s;uch, madam, would be, in my opi|nion, the proper hu&s;band." "Ah, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "but do you know of any &s;uch per&s;on?"&mdash;No, madam," re|turned he, "it is impo&s;&s;ible to know any per&s;on that de|&s;erves to be her hu&s;band: &s;he's too great a trea&s;ure for one man's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he's a godde&s;s. Upon my &s;oul, I &s;peak what I think, &s;he's an angel."&mdash;" Ah, Mr. Thorn|hill, you only flatter my poor girl: but we have been thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants, who&s;e mother is lately dead, and who wants a manager: you know whom I mean, farmer Williams: a warm man, Mr. Thornhill, able to give her good bread; ay, and who has &s;everal times made her propo&s;als: (which was actually the ca&s;e) but, Sir concluded &s;he, I &s;hould be glad to have your approbation of our choice."&mdash;"How, madam," replied he, "my approbation! My approba|tion of &s;uch a choice! Never! What! Sacrifice &s;o much beauty, and &s;en&s;e, and goodne&s;s, to a creature in&s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ing! Excu&s;e me, I can never approve of &s;uch a piece of inju&s;tice! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I have my rea&s;ons?"&mdash;"Indeed, Sir," cried D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if you have your rea&s;ons, that's another affair, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould be glad to know tho&s;e rea|&s;ons.&mdash;"Excu&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> madam," returned he, "they lie too deep for di&s;cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wing his hand upon his bo&s;om) they remain burie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivetted here.</P>
<P>After he was gone, upon general con&s;ultation we could not tell what to make of the&s;e fine &s;entiments.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Scarce any virtue found to re&s;i&s;t the power of long and plea&s;ing temptation.</HEAD>
<P>AS I only &s;tudied my child's real happine&s;s, the a&s;|&s;iduity of Mr. Williams plea&s;ed me, as he was in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, prudent and &s;incere. It required but very little encouragement to revive his former pa&s;|&s;ion; &s;o that in an evening or two after, he and Mr. Thornhill met at our hou&s;e, and &s;urveyed each other for &s;ome time with looks of anger: but Williams owed his landlord no rent, and little regarded his indignation. Olivia, on her &s;ide, acted the coquet to perfection, if that might be called acting which was her real charac|ter, pretending to lavi&s;h all her tenderne&s;s on her new lover. Mr. Thornhill appeared quite dejected at this preference, and with a pen&s;ive air took leave, though I own it puzzled me to find him &s;o much in pain as he appeared to be, when he had it in his power &s;o ea&s;ily to remove the cau&s;e, by declaring an honourable pa&s;&s;ion. But whatever unea&s;ine&s;s he &s;eemed to endure, it could ea&s;ily be perceived that Olivia's angui&s;h was &s;till greater. After any of the&s;e interviews between her lovers, of which there were &s;everal&punc; &s;he u&s;ually retired to &s;olitude, and there indulged her grief. It was in &s;uch a &s;ituation I found her one evening, after &s;he had been for &s;ome time &s;upporting a fictitious gaiety.&mdash;
<Q>You now &s;ee, my child,</Q> &s;aid I,
<Q>that your confidence in Mr. Thorn|hill's pa&s;&s;ion was all a dream: he permits the rivalry of another every way his inferior, though he knows it lies in his power to &s;ecure you by a candid declara|tion of him&s;elf.</Q> &mdash;"Yes, papa," returned &s;he,
<Q>but he has his rea&s;ons for this delay: I know he has. The &s;incerity of his looks and words convince me of
<PB N="74" REF="012405_0073_0F8972D43AA0C230">
his real e&s;teem. A &s;hort time, I hope, will di&s;cover the genero&s;ity of his &s;entiments, and convince you that my opinion of him has been more ju&s;t than yours.</Q> &mdash; "Olivia, my darling," returned I,
<Q>every &s;cheme that has been hitherto pur&s;ued to compel him to a decla|ration, has been propo&s;ed and planned by your&s;elf, nor can you in the lea&s;t &s;ay that I have con&s;trained you. But you mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e, my dear, that I will be ever in&s;trumental in &s;uffering his hone&s;t rival to be the dupe of your ill-placed pa&s;&s;ion. Whatever time you require to bring your fancied admirer to an explanation &s;hall be granted? but at the expira|tion of that term, if he is &s;till regardle&s;s, I mu&s;t ab&s;o|lutely in&s;i&s;t that hone&s;t Mr. Williams &s;hall be re|warded for his fidelity. The character which I have hitherto &s;upported in life demand this from me, and my tenderne&s;s, as a parent, &s;hall never influence my integrity as a man. Name then your day, let it be as di&s;tant as you think proper, and in the mean time take care to let Mr. Thornhill know the exact time on which I de&s;ign delivering you up to another. If he really loves you, his own good &s;en&s;e will readily &s;ugge&s;t that there is but one method alone to prevent his lo&s;ing you for ever.</Q> &mdash;This propo&s;al, which &s;he could not avoid con&s;idering as perfectly ju&s;t, was readily agreed to. She again renewed her mo&s;t po&s;i|tive promi&s;e of marrying Mr. Williams, in ca&s;e of the other's in&s;en&s;ibility; and at the next opportunity, in Mr. Thornhill's pre&s;ence, that day month was fixed upon for her nuptials with his rival.</P>
<P>Such vigorous proceedings &s;eemed to redouble Mr. Thornhill's anxiety; but what Olivia really &s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gave me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. In this &s;truggle between prudence and pa&s;&s;ion, her vivacity quite for&s;ook her, and every oppor|tunity of &s;olitude was &s;ought, and &s;pent in tears. One week pa&s;&s;ed away; but her lover made no efforts to re|&s;train her nuptials. The &s;ucceeding week he was &s;till a&s;&s;iduous; but not more open. On the third he di&s;con|tinued his vi&s;its entirely, and in&s;tead of my daughter te&s;tifying any impatience, as I expected, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;eemed to retain a pen&s;ive tranquillity, which I looked upon as re|&s;ignation. For my own part, I was now &s;incerely plea&s;ed
<PB N="75" REF="012405_0074_0F8972D4B2563718">
with thinking that my child was going to be &s;ecured in a continuance of competence and peace, and frequently applauded her re&s;olution. It was within about four days of her intended nuptials that my little family at night were gathered round a charming fire, telling &s;tories of the pa&s;t, and laying &s;chemes for the future. Bu&s;ied in forming a thou&s;and projects, and laughing at whatever folly came uppermo&s;t, "Well, Mo&s;es," cried I,
<Q>we &s;hall &s;oon, my boy, have a wedding in the family, what is your opinion of matters and things in gene|ral?</Q> &mdash; <Q>My opinion, father, is, that all things go on very well; and I was ju&s;t now thinking, that when &s;i&s;ter Livy is married to farmer Williams, we &s;hall then have the loan of his cyder-pre&s;s and brew|ing tubs for nothing.</Q>&mdash;"That we &s;hall, Mo&s;es," cried I,
<Q>and he will &s;ing us Death and the Lady, to rai&s;e our &s;pirits into the bargain.</Q> &mdash; <Q>He has taught that &s;ong to our Dick,</Q> cried Mo&s;es;

<Q>A very good boy, Bill, upon my word, and an elegy that may truly be called tragical. Come, my children, here's Bill's health, and may he one day be a bi&s;hop.</Q></P>
<P>"With all my heart," cried my wife;
<Q>and if he but preaches as well as he &s;ings, I make no doubt of him. The mo&s;t of his family, by the mother's &s;ide. could &s;ing a good &s;ong: it was a common &s;aying in our country, that the family of the Blenkin&s;ops could never look &s;traight before them, nor the Huggin&s;es blow out a candle; that there were none of the Grograms but could &s;ing a &s;ong, or of the Majorams but could tell a &s;tory,</Q> &mdash;"However that be," cried I,
<Q>the mo&s;t vulgar ballad of them all generally plea&s;es me better than the fine modern odes, and things that petrify us in a &s;ingle &s;tanza; productions that we at once dete&s;t and prai&s;e. Put the gla&s;s to your brother, Mo&s;es. The great fault of the&s;e ele|gi&s;ts is, that they are in de&s;pair for griefs that give the &s;en&s;ible part of mankind very little pain. A lady lo&s;es her lap dog, and &s;o the &s;illy poet runs home to ver&s;ify the di&s;a&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>"That may be the mode," cried Mo&s;es,
<Q>in &s;ub|blimer compo&s;itions; but the Ranelagh &s;ongs that come down to us are perfectly familiar, and all ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould: Collin meets Dolly, and they hold a dialogue together, he gives her a fairing to put in her hair, and &s;he pre&s;ents him with a no&s;egay, and then they go together to church, where they give good advice to young nymphs and &s;wains to get married as fa&s;t as they can.</Q></P>
<P>"And very good advice too," cried I,
<Q>and I am told there is not a place in the world where advice can be given with &s;o much propriety as there; for as it per&s;uades us to marry, it al&s;o furni&s;hes us with a wife, and &s;urely that mu&s;t be an excellent market, my boy, where we are told what we want, and &s;up|plied with it when wanting.</Q></P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," returned Mo&s;es,
<Q>and I know but of two &s;uch markets for wives in Europe, Ranelagh in England, and Fontarabia in Spain. The Spani&s;h
<PB N="78" REF="012405_0077_0F8972D6F2024EA0">
market is open once a year, but our Engli&s;h wives are &s;aleable every night.</Q></P>
<P>"You are right, my boy," cried his mother,
<Q>Old England is the only place in the world for hu&s;bands to get wives.</Q> &mdash; <Q>And for wives to manage their hu&s;bands,</Q> interrupted I&punc;
<Q>It is a proverb abroad, that if a bridge were built acro&s;s the &s;ea, all the la|dies of the Continent would come over to take pat|tern from ours; for there are no &s;uch wives in Eu|rope as our own.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But let us have one bottle more, Deborah, my life, and Mo&s;es give us a good &s;ong. What thanks do we not we owe to heaven for thus be&s;towing tranquillity, health and competence. I think my&s;elf happier now than the greate&s;t monarch upon earth. He has no &s;uch fire-&s;ide, nor &s;uch plea&s;ant faces about it. Yes, Deborah, my dear, we are now growing old; but the evening of our life is likely to be happy. We are de&s;cended from ance&s;tors that knew no &s;tain, and we &s;hall leave a good and virtuous race of chil|dren behind us. While we live they will be our &s;up|port and our plea&s;ure here, and when we die they will tran&s;mit our honour untainted to po&s;terity. Come, my &s;on, we wait for your &s;ong: let us have a cho|rus. But where is my darling Olivia? That little cherub's voice is always &s;weete&s;t in the concert.</Q>&mdash; Ju&s;t as I &s;poke Dick came running in&mdash; <Q>O papa, papa, &s;he is gone from us, &s;he is gone from us, my &s;i&s;ter Livy is gone from us, for ever.</Q> &mdash; <Q>Gone, child!</Q> &mdash;Yes, &s;he is gone off with two gentlemen in
<Q>a po&s;t chai&s;e, and one of them ki&s;&s;ed her, and &s;aid he would die for her; and &s;he cried very much, and was for coming back; but he per&s;uaded her again and &s;he went into the chai&s;e, and &s;aid, O what will my poor papa do when he knows I am undone!</Q> &mdash; "Now then," cried I,
<Q>my children, go and be mi&s;e|rable; for we &s;hall never enjoy one hour more. And O may heaven's everla&s;ting fury light upon him and his! Thus to rob me of my child! And &s;ure it will, for taking back my &s;weet innocent that I was leading up to heaven Such &s;incerity as my child was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. But all our earthly happine&s;s is now over. Go

my children, go, and be mi&s;erable and infamous; for my heart is broken within me!</Q> &mdash;"Father," cried, my &s;on, "is this your fortitude?"&mdash; <Q>Fortitude, child! Yes, he &s;hall &s;ee I have fortitude! Bring me my pi&s;tols. I'll pur&s;ue the traitor. While he is on earth I'll pur&s;ue him. Old as I am, he &s;hall find I can &s;ting him yet. The villain! The per&s;idious villain!</Q> &mdash;I had by this time reached down my pi&s;tols, when my poor wife, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were not &s;o &s;trong as mine, caught me in her arms.
<Q>My deare&s;t, deare&s;t hu&s;band,</Q> cried &s;he,
<Q>the bible is the only weapon that is fit for your old hands now. Open that my love, and read our angui&s;h into patience, for &s;he has vilely deceived</Q> &mdash;Her &s;orrow repre&s;&s;ed the re&s;t in &s;ilence.&mdash;"Indeed, Sir," re&s;umed my &s;on, after a pau&s;e,
<Q>your rage is too violent and unbecom|ing. You &s;hould be my mother's comforter, and you encrea&s;e her pain. It ill &s;uited you and your reverend character thus to cur&s;e your greate&s;t enemy: you &s;hould not to have cur&s;t the wretch, villain as he is.</Q> &mdash;"I did not cur&s;e him, child, did I?"&mdash; <Q>In|deed, Sir, you did, you cur&s;t him twice.</Q>&mdash; <Q>Then may Heaven forgive me and him if I did! And now, my &s;on, I &s;ee it was more than human benevo|lence that fir&s;t taught us to ble&s;s our enemies! Ble&s;t be his holy name for all the good he has given, and for that he has taken away. But it is not, it is not a &s;mall di&s;tre&s;s that can wring tears from the&s;e old eyes, that have not wept for &s;o many years. My child!&mdash; To undo my darling! May confu&s;ion &s;eize! Heaven forgive me, what am I about to &s;ay! You may remember, my love, how good &s;he was, and how charming; till this vile moment all her care was to make us happy. Had &s;he but died! But &s;he is gone, the honour of our family contaminated, and I mu&s;t look out for happine&s;s in other worlds than here. But, my child, you &s;aw them go off: perhaps he forced her away? If he forced her, &s;he may yet be innocent.</Q> &mdash;"Ah no, Sir!" cried the child,
<Q>he only ki&s;&s;ed her, and called her his angel, and &s;he wept very much, and leaned upon his arm, and they drove off very fa&s;t.</Q> &mdash;"She's an ungrateful creature," cried
<PB N="80" REF="012405_0079_0F8972D871B7A558">
my wife, who could &s;carce &s;peak for weeping,
<Q>to u&s;e us thus. She never had the lea&s;t con&s;traint put upon her affections. The vile &s;trumpet has ba&s;ely de&s;erted her parents without any provocation, thus to bring your grey hairs to the grave, and I mu&s;t &s;hortly fol|low.</Q></P>
<P>In this manner that night, the fir&s;t of our real mi&s;|fortunes, was &s;pent in the bitterne&s;s of complaint, and ill &s;upported &s;allies of enthu&s;ia&s;m. I determined, how|ever, to find out our betrayer, wherever he was, and reproach his ba&s;ene&s;s. The next morning we mi&s;&s;ed our wretched child at breakfa&s;t, where &s;he u&s;ed to give life and chearfulne&s;s to us all. My wife, as before, at|tempted to ea&s;e her heart by reproaches. "Never," cried &s;he,
<Q>&s;hall that vile&s;t &s;tain of our family again darken tho&s;e harmle&s;s doors. I will never call her daughter more. No, let the &s;trumpet live with her vile &s;educer: She may bring us to &s;hame, but &s;he &s;hall never more deceive us.</Q></P>
<P>"Wife," &s;aid I,
<Q>do not talk thus hardly: my de|te&s;tation of her guilt is as great as yours; but ever &s;hall this hou&s;e and this heart be open to a poor re|turning repentant &s;inner. The &s;ooner &s;he returns from her tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the more welcome &s;hall &s;he be to me. For the fir&s;t time the very be&s;t may err; art may per&s;uade, and novelty &s;pread out its charm. The fir&s;t fault is the child of &s;implicity; but every other the offspring of guilt. Yes, the wretched creature &s;hall be welcome to this heart and this hou&s;e, tho' &s;tained with ten thou&s;and vices. I will again hearken to the mu&s;ic of her voice, again will I hang fondly on her bo&s;om, if I find but repentance there. My &s;on, bring hither my bible and my &s;taff; I will pur|&s;ue her, wherever &s;he is, and tho' I cannot &s;ave her from &s;hame, I may prevent the continuance of ini|quity.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. The pur&s;uit of a father to reclaim a lo&s;t child to virtue.</HEAD>
<P>THO' the child could not de&s;cribe the gentle|man's per&s;on who handed his &s;i&s;ter into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, yet my &s;u&s;picions tell entirely upon our young landlord, who&s;e character for &s;uch intrigues was but too well known. I therefore directed my &s;teps towards Thornhill-ca&s;tle. re&s;olving to upbraid him, and, if po&s;|&s;ible to bring back my daughter: but before I had reached his &s;eat, I was met by one of my pari&s;hioners, who &s;aid he &s;aw a young lady re&s;embling my daughter in a po&s;t-chai&s;e with a gentleman, whom, by the de|&s;cription, I could only gue&s;s to be Mr. Burchell, and that they drove very fa&s;t. This information, however, did by no means &s;atisfy me. I therefore went to the young 'Squire's, and though it was yet early, in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing him immediately: he &s;oon appeared with the mo&s;t open familiar air, and &s;eemed perfectly amazed at my daughter's elopement, prote&s;ting upon his honour that he was quite a &s;tranger to it. I now therefore con|demned my former &s;u&s;picions, and could turn them only on Mr. Burchell, who I recollected had of late &s;everal private conferences with her: but the appearance of another witne&s;s left me no room to doubt of his villainy, who averred, that he and my daughter were actually gone towards the wells, about thirty miles off, where there was a great deal of company. Hearing this, I re|&s;olved to pur&s;ue them there. I walked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g with ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, and enquired of &s;everal by the way, but re|ceived no accounts, till entering the town, I was met by a per&s;on on hor&s;eback, whom I remembered to have &s;een at the Squire's, and he a&s;&s;ured me that if I followed them to the races, which were but thirty miles farther, I might depend upon overtaking them; for he had &s;een them dance there the night before, and the whole a&s;|&s;embly
<PB N="82" REF="012405_0081_0F8972DB01B82F80">
&s;eemed charmed with my daughter's performance. Early the next day I walked forward to the races, and about four in the afternoon I came upon the cour&s;e. The company made a very brilliant appearance, all ear|ne&s;tly employed in one pur&s;uit, that of plea&s;ure; how different from mine, that of reclaiming a lo&s;t child to virtue! I thought I perceived Mr. Burchell at &s;ome di&s;|tance from me: but, as if he dreaded an interview, upon my approaching him, he mixed among a crowd, and I &s;aw him no more. I now reflected that it would be to no purpo&s;e to continue my pur&s;uit farther, and re&s;olved to return home to an innocent family, who wanted my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But the agitations of my mind, and the fatigues I had undergone, threw me into a fe|ver, the &s;ymptoms of which I perceived before I came off the cour&s;e. This was another unexpected &s;troke, as I was more than &s;eventy miles di&s;tant from home: however, I retired to a little ale-hou&s;e by the road-&s;ide, and in this place, the u&s;ual retreat of indigence and fru|gality, I laid me down patiently to wait the i&s;&s;ue of my di&s;order. I langui&s;hed here for near three weeks; but at la&s;t my con&s;titution prevailed, though I was unpro|vided with money to defray the expences of my enter|tainment. It is po&s;&s;ible the anxiety from this la&s;t cir|cum&s;tance alone might have brought on a relap&s;e, had I not been &s;upplied by a traveller, who &s;topt to take a cur&s;ory refre&s;hment. This per&s;on was no other than the philanthropic book&s;eller in St. Paul's church-yard, who has written &s;o many little books for children: he called him&s;elf their friend; but he was the friend of all mankind. He was no &s;ooner alighted, but he was in ha&s;te to be gone; for he was ever on bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t importance, and was at that time actually com|piling materials for the hi&s;tory of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I immediately recollected this good-natured man's red pimpled face; for he had publi&s;hed for me again&s;t the Deuterogami&s;ts of the age, and from him I borrowed a few pieces, to be paid at my return. Leaving the inn, therefore, as I was yet but weak, I re&s;olved to return home by ea&s;y journeys of ten miles a day. My health and u&s;ual tranquillity were almo&s;t re&s;tored, and I now condemned that pride which had made me refractory
<PB N="83" REF="012405_0082_0F8972DB75775508">
to the hand of correction. Man little knows what ca|lamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them; as in a&s;cending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every &s;tep we ri&s;e &s;hews us &s;ome new pro&s;pect of hidden di&s;appointment; &s;o in our de|&s;cent to the vale of wretchedne&s;s, which, from the &s;um|mits of plea&s;ure appears dark and gloomy, the bu&s;y mind &s;till attentive to its own amu&s;ement, finds &s;omething to flatter and &s;urpri&s;e it. Still as we de&s;cend, the objects appear to brighten, unexpected pro&s;pects amu&s;e, and the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I now proceeded forwards, and had walked about two hours, when I perceived what appeared at a di&s;|tance like the waggon, which I was re&s;olved to over|take; but when I came up with it, found it to be a &s;trolling company's cart, that was carrying their &s;cenes and other theatrical furniture to the next village, where they were to exhibit. The cart was attended only by the per&s;on who drove it, and one of the company, as the re&s;t of the players were to follow the en&s;uing day. Good company upon the road, &s;ays the proverb, is al|ways the &s;horte&s;t cut, I therefore entered into conver|&s;ation with the poor player; and as I once had &s;ome theatrical powers my&s;elf, I de&s;canted on &s;uch topics with my u&s;ual freedom: but as I was pretty much unac|quainted with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the &s;tage, I demanded who where the pre&s;ent theatrical writers in vogue, who the Drydens and Otways of the day.&mdash; <Q>I fancy, Sir,</Q> cried the player,
<Q>few of our modern drama|ti&s;ts would think them&s;elves much honoured by being compared to the writers you mention. Dryden and Rowe's manner, Sir, are quite out of fa&s;hion; our ta&s;te has gone back a whole century. Fletcher, Ben John&s;on, and all the plays of Shake&s;peare, are the only things that go down.</Q> &mdash;"How," cried I,
<Q>is it po&s;&s;ible the pre&s;ent age can be plea&s;ed with that anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uated dialect that ob&s;olete humour, tho&s;e over charged characters, which abound in the works you mentioned?</Q> &mdash;"Sir," returned my companion,
<Q>the publick think nothing about dialect, or humour, or character; for that is none of their bu&s;ine&s;s, they only go to be amu&s;ed, and find them&s;elves happy
<PB N="84" REF="012405_0083_0F8972DC321453E8">
when they can enjoy a pantomime, under the &s;anction of John&s;on's or Shake&s;pear's name.</Q> &mdash; <Q>So then, I &s;uppo&s;e,</Q> cried I,
<Q>that our modern dramati&s;ts are rather imitators of Shake&s;peare than of nature.</Q> &mdash; "To &s;ay the truth," returned my companion,
<Q>I don't know that they imitate any thing at all; nor indeed does the publick require it of them: it is not the com|po&s;ition of the piece, but the number of &s;tarts and at|titudes that may be introduced into it that forces ap|plau&s;e. I have known a piece, with not one je&s;t in the whole, &s;hrugged into popularity, and another &s;aved by the poet's throwing in a fit of the gripes. No, Sir, the works of Congreve and Farquhar have too much wit in them for the pre&s;ent ta&s;te; our modern dialogue is much more natural.</Q></P>
<P>By this time the equipage of the &s;trolling company was arrived at the village, which, it &s;eems, had been ap|pri&s;ed of our approach, and was come out to gaze at us; for my companion ob&s;erved, that &s;trollers always have more &s;pectators without doors than within. I did not con&s;ider the impropriety of my being in &s;uch company till I &s;aw a mob gathered about me. I therefore took &s;helter, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, in the fir&s;t ale-hou&s;e that of|fered, and being &s;hewn into the common room, was ac|co&s;ted by a very well-dre&s;t gentleman, who demanded whether I was the real chaplain of the company, or whether it was only to be my ma&s;querade character in the play. Upon informing him of the truth, and that I did not belong to the company, he was conde&s;cending enough to de&s;ire me and the player to partake of a bowl of punch, over which he di&s;cu&s;&s;ed modern politics with great earne&s;tne&s;s and &s;eeming intere&s;t. I &s;et him down in my own mind for nothing le&s;s than a parliament-man at lea&s;t; but was almo&s;t confirmed in my conjectures, when upon my a&s;king what there was in the hou&s;e for &s;upper, he in&s;i&s;ted that the player and I &s;hould &s;up with him at his hou&s;e, with which reque&s;t, after &s;ome entrea|ties, I was prevailed on to comply.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. The de&s;cription of a per&s;on di&s;contented with the pre|&s;ent government, and apprehen&s;ive of the lo&s;s of our liberties.</HEAD>
<P>THE hou&s;e where we were to be entertained, ly|ing at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the village, our invi|ter ob&s;erved, that as the coach was not ready, he would conduct us on foot, and we &s;oon arrived at one of the mo&s;t magnificent man&s;ions I had &s;een in the country. The apartment into which we were &s;hewn was perfectly elegant and modern; he went to give orders for &s;upper, while the player, with a wink, ob&s;erved that we were perfectly in luck. Our entertainer &s;oon returned, an elegant &s;upper was brought in, two or three ladies, in an ea&s;y di&s;habille, were introduced, and the conver&s;ati|on began with &s;ome &s;prightline&s;s. Politics, however, was the &s;ubject on which our entertainer chiefly expatiat|ed; for he a&s;&s;erted that liberty was at once his boa&s;t and his terror. After the cloth was removed, he a&s;ked me if I had &s;een the la&s;t Monitor, to which replying in the negative, "What, nor the Auditor, I &s;uppo&s;e?" cried he. "Neither, Sir," returned I. "That's &s;trange, very &s;trange," replied my entertainer. Now, I read all the politics that come out. The Daily, the Public, the Ledger, the Chronicle, the London Evening, the Whitehall Evening, the &s;eventeen magazines, and the two reviews; and though they hate each other, I love them all. Liberty, Sir, liberty is the Briton's boa&s;t, and by all my coal mines in Cornwall, I reverence its guardians." "Then it is to be hoped," cried I, "you reverence the king." "Yes," returned my entertainer, "when he does what we would have him; but if he goes on as he has done of late, I'll never trouble my&s;elf more with his matters. I &s;ay nothing. I think only. I could have directed &s;ome things better. I don't think there has been a &s;ufficient number of advi&s;ers; he &s;hould

<P>"I wi&s;h," cried I, "that &s;uch intruding advi&s;ers were fixed in the pillory.

But the&s;e ignorants &s;till continue the cry of liberty, and if they have any weight ba&s;ely throw it into the &s;ub&s;id|ing &s;cale."</P>
<P>"How," cried one of the ladies, "do I live to &s;ee one &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o &s;ordid, as to be an enemy to liberty, and a defender of tyrants? Liberty, that &s;acred gift of hea|ven, that glorious privilege of Britons!"</P>
<P>"Can it be po&s;&s;ible, cried our entertainer, "that there &s;hould be any found at pre&s;ent advocates for &s;la|very? Any who are for meanly giving up the privileges of Britons? Can any, Sir, be &s;o abject?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir," replied I, "I am for liberty, that attri|bute of Gods! Glorious liberty! that theme of modern declamation. I would have all men kings. I would be a king my&s;elf. We have all naturally an equal right to the throne: we are all originally equal. This is my o|pinion, and was once the opinion of a &s;et of hone&s;t men who were called Levellers. They tried to erect them|&s;elves into a community, where all &s;hould be equally free. But alas! it would never an&s;wer; for there were &s;ome among them &s;tronger, and &s;ome more cunning than others, and the&s;e became ma&s;ters of the re&s;t; for as &s;ure as your groom rides your hor&s;es, becau&s;e be is a cun|ninger animal than they, &s;o &s;urely will the animal that is cunninger animal than they, &s;o &s;urely will the animal that is cunninger or &s;tronger than he, &s;it upon his &s;houl|ders in turn. Since then it is entailed upon humanity to &s;ubmit, and &s;ome are born to command, and others to obey, the que&s;tion is, as there mu&s;t be tyrants, whether it is better to have them in the &s;ame hou&s;e with us, or in the &s;ame village, or &s;till farther off, in the metropo|lis. Now, Sir, for my own part, as I naturally hate the face of a tyrant, the farther off he is removed from me, the better plea&s;ed am I. The generality of man|kind al&s;o are of my way of thinking, and have unani|mou&s;ly
<PB N="87" REF="012405_0086_0F8972DE73459C40">
created one King, who&s;e election at once dimi|ni&s;hes the number of tyrants, and puts tyranny at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the greate&s;t number of people. Now tho&s;e who were tyrants them&s;elves before the elec|tion of one tyrant, are naturally aver&s;e to a power rai&s;|ed over them, and who&s;e weight mu&s;t ever lean heavie&s;t on the &s;ubordinate orders. It is the intere&s;t of the great, therefore, to dimini&s;h kingly power as much as po&s;&s;ible; becau&s;e whatever they take from it is naturally re&s;tored to them&s;elves; and all they have to do in a &s;tate, is to undermine the &s;ingle tyrant, by which they re&s;ume their primaeval authority. Now a &s;tate may be &s;o con&s;tituti|onally circum&s;tanced, its laws may be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, and its men of opulence &s;o minded, as all to con&s;pire to carry on this bu&s;ine&s;s of undermining monarchy. If the cir|cum&s;tances of the &s;tate be &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as to fa|vour the accumulation of wealth, and make the opulent &s;till more rich, this will encrea&s;e their &s;trength and their ambition. But an accumulation of wealth mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be the con&s;equence in a &s;tate, when more riches flow in from external commerce, than ari&s;e from internal in|du&s;try: for external commerce can only be managed to advantage by the rich, and they have al&s;o at the &s;ame time all the emoluments ari&s;ing from internal indu&s;try: &s;o that the rich, in &s;uch a &s;tate, have two &s;ources of wealth, whereas the poor have but one. Thus wealth in all commercial &s;tates is found to accumulate, and &s;uch have hitherto in time become ari&s;tocratical. Be&s;ides this, the very laws of a country may contribute to the accumulation of wealth; as when tho&s;e natural ties that bind the rich and poor together are broken, and it is ordained that the rich &s;hall only marry among each other; or when the learned are held unqualified to &s;erve their country as merely from a defect of opulence, and wealth is thus made the object of a wi&s;e man's ambition, by the&s;e means I &s;ay, and &s;uch means as the&s;e, riches will accumulate. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of accumulated wealth, when furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;aries and plea&s;ures of life, can employ the &s;uperfluity of fortune only in purcha&s;ing power. That is, differently &s;peaking, in making de|pendants, in purcha&s;ing the liberty of the needy or the venal, of men who are willing to bear the mortification
<PB N="88" REF="012405_0087_0F8972DF419BFCC0">
of contiguous tyranny for bread. Thus every very o|pulent man generally gathers round him a circle of the poore&s;t of the people; and the polity abounding in accu|mulated wealth, may be compared to a Carte&s;ian &s;y&s;tem, each orb with a vortex of its own. Tho&s;e, however, who are willing to move in a great man's vortex, are only &s;uch as mu&s;t be &s;laves, the rabble of mankind, who&s;e &s;ouls and who&s;e education are adapted to &s;ervitude, and who know nothing of liberty except the name. But there mu&s;t &s;till be a large number of the people without the &s;phere of the opulent man's influence, namely, that order of men which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the very rich and the very rabble; tho&s;e men who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two large fortunes to &s;ubmit to the neighbouring man in power, and yet are too poor to &s;et up for tyranny them|&s;elves. In this middle order of mankind are generally to be found all the arts, wi&s;dom, and virtues of &s;ociety. This order alone is known to be the true pre&s;erver of freedom, and may be called the People. Now it may happen that this middle order of mankind may lo&s;e all its influence in a &s;tate, and its voice be in a manner drowned in that of the rabble: for if the fortune &s;uffici|ent for qualifying a per&s;on at pre&s;ent to give his voice in &s;tate affairs, be ten times le&s;s than was judged &s;ufficient upon forming the con&s;titution, it is evident that greater numbers of the rabble will thus be introduced into the political &s;y&s;tem, and they, ever moving in the vortex of the great, will follow where greatne&s;s &s;hall direct. In &s;uch a &s;tate, therefore, all that middle order has left, is to pre&s;erve the prerogative and privileges of one princi|pal tyrant with the mo&s;t &s;acred circum&s;pection. For he divides the power of the rich, and calls off the great from falling with tenfold weight on the middle order placed beneath them. The middle order may be com|pared to a town of which the opulent are forming the &s;iege, and which the tyrant is ha&s;tening to relieve. While the be&s;iegers are in dread of the external enemy, it is but natural to offer the town&s;men the mo&s;t &s;pecious terms; to flatter them with &s;ounds, and amu&s;e them with privileges: but if they once defeat the tyrant, the walls of the town will be but a &s;mall defence to its inha|bitants. What they may then expect, may be &s;een by
<PB N="89" REF="012405_0088_0F8972DFF7EF0010">
turning our eyes to Holland, Genoa, or Venice, where the laws govern the poor, and the rich govern the law. I am then for, and would die for, monarchy, &s;acred monarchy; for if there be any thing &s;acred among&s;t men, it mu&s;t be the anointed &s;overeign of his people, and eve|ry diminution of his power in war, or in peace, is an in|fringement upon the real liberties of the &s;ubject. The &s;ounds of liberty, patrioti&s;m, and Britons, have already done <HI>much;</HI> it is to be hoped that the true &s;ons of free|dom will prevent their ever doing more. I have known many of tho&s;e bold champions for liberty in my time, yet do I not remember one that was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant."</P>
<P>My warmth I found had lengthened this harangue be|yond the rules of good breeding: but the impatience of my entertainer, who often &s;trove to interrupt it could be re&s;trained no longer. "What," cried he, "then I have been all this while entertaining a Je&s;uit in par&s;on's cloaths: but by all the coal mines of Cornwall, out he &s;hall pack, if my name be Wilkin&s;on. I now found I had gone too far, and a&s;ked pardon for the warmth with which I had &s;poken. "Pardon," returned he in a fu|ry: "I think &s;uch principles demand ten thou&s;and par|dons. What, give up liberty, property, and, as the Gazetteer &s;ays, lie down to be &s;addled with wooden &s;hoes! Sir, I in&s;i&s;t upon your marching out of this hou&s;e immediately to prevent wor&s;e con&s;equences, Sir, I in&s;i&s;t upon it." I was going to repeat my remon&s;trances; but ju&s;t then we heard a footman's rap at the door, and the two ladies cried out, "As &s;ure as death there is our ma|&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s come home." It &s;eems my entertainer was all this while only the butler, who, in his ma&s;ter's ab&s;ence, had a mind to cut a figure, and be for a while the gentleman him&s;elf; and to &s;ay the truth, he talked politics as well as mo&s;t country gentleman do. But no|thing could now exceed my confu&s;ion upon &s;eeing the gentleman, with his lady, enter, nor was their &s;urprize, at finding &s;uch company and good cheer, le&s;s than ours. "Gentlemen," cried the real ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, to me and my companion, "I am your mo&s;t humble &s;er|vant; but I prote&s;t this is &s;o unexpected a favour, that I almo&s;t &s;ink under the obligation." However unexpected

our company might be to him, his, I am &s;ure, was &s;till more to us, and I was &s;truck dumb with the apprehen&s;i|ons of my own ab&s;urdity, when whom &s;hould I next &s;ee enter the room but my dear mi&s;s Arabella Wilmot, who was formerly de&s;igned to be married to my &s;on George; but who&s;e match was broken off, as already related. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he flew to my arms with the utmo&s;t joy. "My dear &s;ir," cried &s;he, "to what happy acci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dent is it that we owe &s;o unexpected a vi&s;it? I am &s;ure my uncle and aunt will be in raptures when they find they have the good Dr. Primro&s;e for their gue&s;t." Upon hearing my name, the old gentleman and lady very po|litely &s;tept up, and welcomed me with mo&s;t cordial ho&s;|pitality. Nor could they forbear &s;miling upon being in|formed of the nature of my pre&s;ent vi&s;it: but the unfor|tunate butler, whom they at fir&s;t &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to turn away, was, at my interce&s;&s;ion, forgiven.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold and his lady, to whom the hou&s;e belong|ed now, in&s;i&s;ted upon having the plea&s;ure of my &s;tay for &s;ome days, and as their niece, my charming pupil, who&s;e mind, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, had been formed under my own in&s;tructions, joined in their entreaties, I complied. That night I was &s;hewn to a magnificent chamber, and the next morning early, Mi&s;s Wilmot de&s;ired to walk with me in the garden, which was decorated in the modern manner. After &s;ome time &s;pent in pointing out the beauties of the place, &s;he enquired with &s;eeming uncon|cern, when la&s;t I had heard from my &s;on George.
<Q>A|las! Madam,</Q> cried I,
<Q>he has now been near three years ab&s;ent, without ever writing to his friends or me. Where he is I know not; perhaps I &s;hall never &s;ee him or happine&s;s more. No, my dear Madam, we &s;hall never more &s;ee &s;uch plea|&s;ing hours as were once &s;pent by our fire-&s;ide at Wakefield. My little family are now di&s;per&s;ing very fa&s;t, and poverty has brought not only want, but in|famy upon us.</Q> The good-natured girl let fall a tear at this account; but as I &s;aw her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of too much &s;en&s;ibility, I forbore a more minute detail of our &s;ufferings. It was, however, &s;ome con&s;olation to me to find that time had made no alteration in her affecti|ons, and that &s;he had rejected &s;everal matches that had
<PB N="91" REF="012405_0090_0F8972E27B728568">
been made her &s;ince our leaving her part of the country. She led me round all the exten&s;ive improvements of the place, pointing to the &s;everal walks and arbours, and at the &s;ame time catching from every object a hint for &s;ome new que&s;tion relative to my &s;on. In this manner we &s;pent the forenoon, till the bell &s;ummoned us in to dinner, where we found the manager of the &s;trolling company, who was come to di&s;po&s;e of tickets for the Fair Penitent, which was to be acted that evening, the part of Horatio by a young gentleman who had never ap|peared on any &s;tage before. He &s;eemed to be very warm in the prai&s;es of the new performer, and averred, that he never &s;aw any who bid &s;o fair for excellence. Acting he ob&s;erved was not learned in a day;
<Q>But this gentleman,</Q> continued he,
<Q>&s;eems born to tread the &s;tage. His voice, his figure, and attitudes, are all admirable. We caught him up accidentally in our journey down.</Q> This account in &s;ome mea&s;ure, excited our curio&s;ity, and, at the entreaty of the ladies, I was prevailed upon to accompany them to the play|hou&s;e, which was no other than a barn. As the com|pany with which I went was inconte&s;tably the chief of the place, we were received with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, and placed in the front &s;eat of the theatre; where we &s;at for &s;ome time with no &s;mall impatience to &s;ee Ho|ratio make his appearance. The new perfomer ad|vanced at la&s;t, and I found it was my unfortunate &s;on. He was going to begin, when, turning his eyes upon the audience, he perceived us, and &s;tood at once &s;peech|le&s;s and immoveable. The actors behind the &s;cenes, who a&s;cribed this pau&s;e to his natural timidity, attempt|ed to encourage him; but in&s;tead of going on, he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and retired off the &s;tage. I don't know what were the &s;en&s;ations I felt; for they &s;ucceeded with too much rapidity for de&s;cription: but I was &s;oon awaked from this di&s;agreeable reverie by Mi&s;s Wilmot, who, pale and with a trembling voice, de&s;ired me to conduct her back to her uncle's. When got home, Mr. Arnold, who was as yet a &s;tranger to our extraordinary behaviour, being informed that the new performer was my &s;on, &s;ent his coach, and an in|vitation, for him; and as he per&s;i&s;ted in his refu&s;al to

appear again upon the &s;tage, the players put another in his place, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;oon had him with us. Mr. Arnold gave him the kinde&s;t reception, and I received him with my u&s;ual tran&s;port; for I could never counterfeit fal&s;e re&s;entment. Mi&s;s Wilmot's reception was mixed with &s;eeming neglect, and yet I could perceive &s;he acted a &s;tudied part. The tumult in her mind &s;eemed not yet abated; &s;he &s;aid twenty giddy things that looked like joy, and then laughed loud at her own want of meaning. At intervals &s;he would take a &s;ly peep at the gla&s;s, as if happy in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of unre&s;i&s;ting beauty, and often would a&s;k que&s;tions, without giving any manner of attention to the an&s;wers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The hi&s;tory of a philo&s;ophic vagabond, pur&s;uing no|velty, but lo&s;ing content.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER we had &s;upped, Mrs. Arnold politely of|fered to &s;end a couple of her footmen for my &s;on's baggage, which he at fir&s;t &s;eemed to decline; but upon her pre&s;&s;ing the reque&s;t, he was obliged to inform her, that a &s;tick and a wallet were all the moveable things upon this earth that he could boa&s;t of. "Why, aye, my &s;on," cried I, "you left me but poor, and poor I find you are come back; and yet I make no doubt you have &s;een a great deal of the world."&mdash; "Yes, Sir," replied my &s;on, "but travelling after for|tune, is not the way to &s;ecure her; and, indeed, of late, I have de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit,"&mdash;"I fancy Sir," cried Mrs Arnold," "that the account of your adventures would be amu&s;ing: the fir&s;t part of them I have often heard from my niece: but could the company prevail for the re&s;t, it would be an additi|onal obligation."&mdash;"Madam," replied my &s;on, "I can promi&s;e you the plea&s;ure you have in hearing, will not be half &s;o great as my vanity in the recital and yet in the whole narrative I can &s;carce promi&s;e you one adventure, as my account is not of what I did, but what I &s;aw. The fir&s;t misfortune of my life, which you all know was great; but tho' it di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, it could not &s;ink me. No per&s;on ever had a better knack at hoping than I. The le&s;s kind I found fortune then, the more I expected from her another time, and being now at the bottom of her wheel, every new revolution might lift, but could not depre&s;s me. I proceeded there|fore, towards London in a fine morning no way unea&s;y about to morrow, but chearful as the birds that caroll'd by the road. I comforted my&s;elf with various reflections,
<PB N="96" REF="012405_0094_0F8972E532000898">
that London was the true mart where abilities of every kind were &s;ure of meeting di&s;tinction and reward.</P>
<P>"Upon my arrival in town, Sir, my fir&s;t care was to deliver your letter of recommendation to your cou&s;in who was him&s;elf in little better circum&s;tances than me. My fir&s;t &s;cheme, you know, Sir, was to be the u&s;her at an academy, and I a&s;ked his advice on the affair. Our cou&s;in received the propo&s;al with a true Sardonic grin. Aye, cried he, this is a pretty career, indeed, that has been chalked out for you. I have been once an u&s;her at a boarding &s;chool my&s;elf; and may I die by an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be an under turnkey in Newgate. I was up early and late: I was brow-beat by the ma&s;ter, hated for my ugly face by the mi&s;tre&s;s, worried by the boys within and ne|ver permitted to &s;tir out to meet civility abroad. But are you &s;ure you are fit for a &s;chool? Let me examine you a little. Have you been bred apprentice to the bu&s;ine&s;s? No. Then you won't do for a &s;chool. Can you dre&s;s the boys hair? No. Then you won't do for a &s;chool. Have you had the &s;mall pox? No. Then you won't do for a &s;chool. Can you lie three in a bed? No. Then you will never do for a &s;chool? H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve you got a good &s;tomach? Yes. Then you will by no means do for a &s;chool. No, Sir, if you are fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> genteel ea&s;y profe&s;&s;ion bind your&s;elf &s;even years as an apprentice to turn a cut|ler's wheel; but avoid a &s;chool by any means. But come, continued he, I &s;ee you are a lad of &s;pirit and &s;ome learning, what do you think of commencing au|thor, like me? You have read in books, no doubt, of men of genius &s;tarving at the trade: but at pre&s;ent I'll &s;hew you forty very dull fellows about town that live by it in opulence. All hone&s;t jogg trotmen, who go on &s;moothly and dully, and write hi&s;tory and politics, and are prai&s;ed; and who, had they been bred coblers, would all their lives have only mended &s;hoes, but never made them."</P>
<P>"Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an u&s;her, I re&s;olved to accept his propo&s;al; and having the highe&s;t re&s;pect for literature, I hailed the antiqua mater of Grub-&s;treet with reverence. I thought it my glory to pur&s;ue a track which Dryden
<PB N="97" REF="012405_0095_0F8972E5F1F828F8">
and Otway trod&punc; before me. In fact, I con&s;idered the godde&s;s of this region as the parent of excellence; and however an intercour&s;e with the world might give us good &s;en&s;e, the poverty &s;he granted was the nur&s;e of genius! Big with the&s;e reflections, I &s;at down, and find|ing that the be&s;t things remained to be &s;aid on the wrong &s;ide, I re&s;olved to write a book that &s;hould be wholly new. I therefore dre&s;t up three paradoxes with &s;ome ingenuity. They were fal&s;e, indeed, but they were new. The jewels of truth have been &s;o often imported by others, that nothing was left for me to import but &s;ome &s;plendid things that at a di&s;tance looked every bit as well. Witne&s;s you powers what fancied importance &s;at perched upon my quill while I was writing. The whole learned world, I made no doubt, would ri&s;e to oppo&s;e my &s;y&s;tems; but then I was prepared to oppo&s;e the whole learned world. Like the porcupine I &s;at &s;elf collected, with a quill pointed again&s;t every oppo&s;er"</P>
<P>"Well &s;aid my boy," cried I, "and what &s;ubject did you treat upon? I hope you did not pa&s;s over the importance of Hierarchial monogamy. But I interrupt, go on; you publi&s;hed your paradoxes; well, and what did the learned world &s;ay to your paradoxes?"</P>
<P>"Sir," replied my &s;on, "the learned world &s;aid nothing to my paradoxes? nothing at all, Sir. Every man of them was employed in prai&s;ing his friends and him&s;elf, or condemning his enemies; and unfortunately, as I had neither, I &s;uffered the cruelle&s;t mortification, neglect."</P>
<P>"As I was meditating one day in a coffee-hou&s;e on the fate of my paradoxes, a little man happening to enter the room, placed him&s;elf in the box before me, and after &s;ome preliminary di&s;cour&s;e, finding me to be a &s;cholar, drew out a bundle of propo&s;als, begging me to &s;ub&s;cribe to a new edition he was going to give the world of Propertius, with notes. This demand nece&s;&s;a|rily produced a reply that I had no money; and that conce&s;&s;ion led him on to enquire into the nature of my expectations. Finding that my expectations were ju&s;t as great is my p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, I &s;ee, cried he, you are unacquainted with the to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; I'll teach you a part of it. Look at the&s;e propo&s;als, upon the&s;e very propo&s;als I have &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed

very comfortably for twelve years. The moment a nobleman returns from his travels, a Creolian arrives from Jamaica, or a dowager from her country &s;eat, I &s;trike for a &s;ub&s;cription. I fir&s;t be&s;iege their hearts with flattery, and then pour in my propo&s;als at the breach. If they &s;ub&s;cribe readily the fir&s;t time, I renew my re|que&s;t to beg a dedication fee. If they let me have that, I &s;mite them once more for engraving their coat of arms at the top. Thus, continued he, I live by vanity and laugh at it. But between our&s;elves, I am now too well known, I &s;hould be glad to borrow your face a bit: a nobleman of di&s;tinction has ju&s;t returned from Italy; my face is familiar to his porter; but if you bring this copy of ver&s;es, my life for it you &s;ucceed, and we divide the &s;poil."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s us, George," cried I, "and is that the em|ployment of poets now! Do men of their exalted talents thus &s;toop to beggary! Can they &s;o far di&s;grace their calling, as to make a vile traffic of prai&s;e for bread!"</P>
<P>"O no, Sir," returned he, "a true poet can never be &s;o ba&s;e; for wherever there is genius there is pride. The creatures I now de&s;cribe are only beggars in rhyme. The real poet, as he braves every hard&s;hip for fame, &s;o he is equally a coward to contempt, and none but tho&s;e who are unworthy protection conde&s;cend to &s;olicit it."</P>
<P>"Having a mind too proud to &s;toop to &s;uch indig|nities, and yet a fortune too humble to hazard a &s;econd attempt for fame, I was now obliged to take a middle cour&s;e, and write for bread. But I was unqualified for a profe&s;&s;ion where mere indu&s;try alone could en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. I could not &s;uppre&s;s my lurking pa&s;&s;ion for applau&s;e: but u&s;ually con&s;umed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but little room, when it &s;hould have been more advantageou&s;ly employed in the diffu&s;ive productions of fruitful mediocrity. My little piece would come forth in the mid&s;t of a periodical publication, unno|ticed and unknown. The public were more importantly employed, than to ob&s;erve the ea&s;y &s;implicity of my &s;tyle, or the harmony of my periods. Sheet after &s;heet was thrown off to oblivion. My e&s;&s;ays were buried a|mong the e&s;&s;ays upon liberty, ea&s;tern ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and cures for the bite of a mad dog; while Philau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Philalethes,

Philelutheros, and Philanthropos, all wrote better, be|cau&s;e they wrote fa&s;ter, than I."</P>
<P>"Now, therefore, I began to a&s;&s;ociate with none but di&s;appointed authors, like my&s;elf, who prai&s;ed, deplored, and de&s;pi&s;ed each other. The &s;atisfaction we found in every celebrated writer's attempts, was inver&s;ely as their merits. I found that no genius in another could plea&s;e me. My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that &s;ource of comfort. I could neither read nor write with &s;atisfaction; for excellence in another was my aver&s;i|on, and writing was my trade."</P>
<P>"In the mid&s;t of the&s;e gloomy reflections, as I was one day &s;itting on a bench in St. James's park, a young gentleman of di&s;tinction who had been my intimate ac|quaintance at the univer&s;ity, approached me. We &s;alut|ed each other with &s;ome he&s;itation, he almo&s;t a&s;hamed of being known to one who made &s;o &s;habby an appear|ance, and I afraid of a repul&s;e. But my &s;u&s;picions &s;oon vani&s;hed; for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very good-natured fellow."</P>
<P>"What did you &s;ay, George?" interrupted I. "Thornhill, was not that his name? it can certainly be no other than my landlord."&mdash;"Ble&s;s me," cried Mrs. Arnold, "is Mr. Thornhill &s;o near a neigh|bour of yours? He has long been a friend in our family, and we expect a vi&s;it from him &s;hortly."</P>
<P>"My friend's fir&s;t care," continued my &s;on, "was to alter my appearance by a very fine &s;uit of his own cloaths, and then I was admitted to his table upon the footing of half-friend, half-underling. My bu&s;ine&s;s was to attend him at auctions, to put him in &s;pirits when he &s;at for his picture, to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t at tatter|ing a kip, as the phra&s;e was, when we had a mind for a frolic. Be&s;ides this, I had twenty other little employ|ments in the family. I was to do many &s;mall things without bidding; to carry the cork&s;crew; to &s;tand god|father to all the butler's children; to &s;ing when I was bid; to be never out of humour; always to be humble, and, if I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to be happy."</P>

a rival. A captain of marines, who &s;eemed formed for the place by nature, oppo&s;ed me in my patron's af|fections. His mother had been laundre&s;s to a man of quality, and thus he early acquired a ta&s;te for pimping and pedigree. As this gentleman made it the &s;tudy of his life to be acquainted with lords, though he was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from &s;everal for his &s;tupidity; yet he found many of them who permitted his a&s;&s;iduities, being as dull as him&s;elf. As flattery was his trade, he practi&s;ed it with the ea&s;ie&s;t addre&s;s imaginable; but it came aukward and &s;tiff from me; and as every day my patron's de&s;ire of flattery encrea&s;ed, &s;o every hour being better acquainted with his defects, I became more unwilling to give it. Thus I was once more fairly going to give up the field to the captain, when my friend found occa&s;ion for my a&s;i&s;t|ance. This was nothing le&s;s than to fight a duel for him, with a gentleman who&s;e &s;i&s;ter it was pretended he had u&s;ed ill. I readily complied with his reque&s;t, and tho' I &s;ee you are di&s;plea&s;ed at my conduct, yet as it was a debt indi&s;pen&s;ably due to friend&s;hip, I could not refu&s;e. I undertook the affair di&s;armed my antagoni&s;t, and &s;oon after had the plea&s;ure of finding that the lady was only a woman of the town, and the fellow her bully and a &s;harper. This piece of &s;ervice was repaid with the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude; but as my friend was to leave town in a few days, he knew no other method to &s;erve me, but by recommending me to his uncle Sir William Thornhill, and another nobleman of great di&s;|tinction, who enjoyed a po&s;t under the government. When he was gone, my fir&s;t care was to carry his recom|mendatory letter to his uncle, a man who&s;e character for every virtue was univer&s;al yet ju&s;t. I was received by his &s;ervants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable &s;miles; for the looks of the dome&s;tics ever tran&s;mit their ma&s;ter's benevolence.

that my pre&s;ent refu&s;al may be &s;ome puni&s;hment for your guilt; but &s;till more, that it may be &s;ome induce|ment to your repentance.&mdash;The &s;everity of this rebuke I bore patiently, becau&s;e I knew it was ju&s;t. My whole expectations now, therefore, lay in my letter to the great man. As the doors of the nobility are almo&s;t ever be&s;et with beggars, all ready to thru&s;t in &s;ome &s;ly petition, I found it no ea&s;y matter to gain admittance. However, after bribing the &s;ervants with half my worldly fortune, I was at la&s;t &s;hewn into a &s;pacious apartment, my letter being previou&s;ly &s;ent up for his lord&s;hip's in|&s;pection. During this anxious interval I had full time to look round me. Every thing was grand, and of happy contrivance: the paintings, the furniture, the gildings, petrified me with awe, and rai&s;ed my idea of the owner. Ah, thought I to my&s;elf, how very great mu&s;t the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of all the&s;e things be, who carries in his head the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, and who&s;e hou&s;e di&s;plays half the wealth of a kingdom: &s;ure his genius mu&s;t be unfathom|able! During the&s;e awful reflections I heard a &s;tep come heavily forward. Ah, this is the great man him&s;elf; No, it was only a chambermaid. Another foot was heard &s;oon after. This mu&s;t be He! No, it was only the great man's valet de chambre. At la&s;t his lord&s;hip actually made his appearance. Are you, cried he, the bearer of this here letter? I an&s;wered with a bow.

I &s;aw no more of him&punc; till told by a footman that his lord&s;hip was going to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> coach at the door. Down I immediately followed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> joined my voice to that of three or four more, who came, like me, to petition for favours.

He was by this time got in, and muttered an an&s;wer, half of which only I heard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he other half was lo&s;t in the rattling of his chariot wheels.

&s;ounds till looking round me, I found my&s;elf alone at his lord&s;hip's gate."</P>
<P>"My patience," continued my &s;on, "was now quite exhau&s;ted: &s;tung with the thou&s;and indignities I had met with, I was willing to ca&s;t my&s;elf away, and only wanted the gulph to receive me. I regarded my&s;elf as one of tho&s;e vile things that nature de&s;igned &s;hould be thrown by into her lumber room, there to peri&s;h in unpitied ob|&s;curity. I had &s;till however, half a guninea left, and of that I thought fortune her&s;elf &s;hould not deprive me: but in order to be &s;ure of this I was re&s;olved to go in&s;tantly and &s;pend it while I had it, and then tru&s;t to occurren|ces for the re&s;t. As I was going along with this re&s;olu|tion, it happened that Mr. Crip&s;e's office &s;eemed invit|ingly open to give me a welcome reception. In this of|fice Mr. Crip&s;e kindly offers all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects a generous promi&s;e of 30 l. a year, for which promi&s;e all they give in return is their liberty for life, and permi&s;&s;ion to let him tran&s;port them to America as &s;laves. I was hap|py at finding a place where I could lo&s;e my fears in de&s;|peration, and therefore entred this cell; for it had the appearance of one, being dark, damp, and dirty. Here I found a number of poor creatures, all in circum&s;tances like my&s;elf, expecting the arival of Mr. Crip&s;e, pre&s;enting a true epitome of Engli&s;h impatience. Each untractable &s;oul at variance with fortune, wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ked her injuries on their own hearts: but Mr. Crip&s;e at la&s;t came down, and all our murmurs were hu&s;hed. He deigned to re|gard me with an air of peculiar approbation, and in|deed he was the fir&s;t man who for a month pa&s;t talked to me with &s;miles. After a few que&s;tions, he found I was fit for every thing in the world. He pau&s;ed a while up|on the propere&s;t means of providing for me, and &s;lap|ping his forehead, as if he had found it, a&s;&s;ured me, that there was at that time an emba&s;&s;y talked of from the &s;y|nod of Penn&s;ylvania to the Chicka&s;aw Indians, and that he would u&s;e his intere&s;t to get me made &s;ecretary. I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied, and yet his promi&s;e gave me plea&s;ure, there was &s;omething &s;o mag|nificent in the &s;ound. I fairly, therefore, divide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny half guinea, one half of which went to be added to his thirty thou&s;and pounds, and with the other half I re|&s;olved

to go to the next tavern, to be there more happy than he.</P>
<P>"As I was going out with that re&s;olution, I was met at the door by the captain of a &s;hip, with whom I had formerly &s;ome little acquaintance, and he agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch. As I never cho&s;e to make a &s;ecret of my circum&s;tances, he a&s;&s;ured me that I was upon the very point of ruin, in li&s;tening to the of|fice-keeper's promi&s;es; for that he only de&s;igned to &s;ell me to the plantations." "But," continued he, "I fancy you might, by a much &s;horter voyage, be very ea&s;ily put into a genteel way of bread. Take my advi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. My &s;hip &s;ails to-morrow for Am&s;terdam; what if you go in her as a pa&s;&s;enger? The moment you land all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen Engli&s;h, and I'll warrant you'll get pupils and money enough. I &s;uppo&s;e you un|der&s;tand Engli&s;h," added he, "by this time, or the duece is in it." I confidently a&s;&s;ured him of that; but expre&s;&s;ed a doubt whether the Dutch would be willing to learn Engli&s;h. He affirmed with an oath that they were fond of it to di&s;traction; and upon that affirmati|on I agreed with his propo&s;al, and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch Engli&s;h in Holland. The wind was fair, our voyage &s;hort, and after having paid my pa&s;&s;age with half my moveables, I found my&s;elf, fallen as if from the &s;kies, a &s;tranger in one of the principal &s;treets of Am&s;terdam. In this &s;ituation I was unwilling to let any time pa&s;s unemployed in teaching. I addre&s;|&s;ed my&s;elf therefore to two or three of tho&s;e I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et, who&s;e appearance &s;eemed mo&s;t promi&s;ing; but it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to make our&s;elves mutually under&s;tood. It was not till this very moment I recollected, that in order to teach Dutchmen Engli&s;h, it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould fir&s;t teach me Dutch. How I came to overlook &s;o obvious an objection, is to me amazing; but certain it is I over|looked it.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme thus blown up, I had &s;ome thoughts of fairly &s;hipping back to England again; but happening into company with an Iri&s;h &s;tudent, who was returning from Louvain, our conver&s;ation turning upon topics of literature, (for by the way it may be ob&s;erved, that I always forgot the meanne&s;s of my circum&s;tances when I
<PB N="104" REF="012405_0102_0F89732133A36410">
could conver&s;e upon &s;uch &s;ubjects) from him I learned that there were not two men in his whole univer&s;ity who under&s;tood Greek. This amazed me. I in&s;tantly re|&s;olved to travel to Louvain, and there live by teaching Greek; and in this de&s;ign I was heartened by my bro|ther &s;tudent, who threw out &s;ome hints that a fortune might be got by it.</P>
<P>I &s;et boldly forward the next morning. Every day le&s;&s;ened the burthen of my moveables, like Ae&s;op and his ba&s;ket of bread; for I paid them for my lodgings to the Dutch as I travelled on. When I came to Louvain, I was re&s;olved not to go &s;neaking to the lower profe&s;&s;ors, but openly tendered my talents to the principal him&s;elf. I went, had admittance, and offered him my &s;ervice as a ma&s;ter of the Greek language, which I had been told was a de&s;ideratum in his univer&s;ity. The <HI>principal</HI> &s;eem|ed at fir&s;t to doubt of my abilities; but of the&s;e I offered to convince him, by turning a part of any Greek author he &s;hould fix upon into Latin. Finding me perfectly ear|ne&s;t in my propo&s;al, he addre&s;&s;ed me thus: "You &s;ee me, young man," continued he, I never learned Greek, and I don't find that I ever mi&s;&s;ed it. I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek: I have ten thou&s;and flo|rins a year without Greek: and I eat heartily without Greek. In &s;hort," continued he, "I don't know Greek, and I do not believe there is any u&s;e in it."</P>
<P>I was now too far from home to think of returning: &s;o I re&s;olved to go forward. I had &s;ome knowledge of mu&s;ic, with a tolerable voice, and now turned what was once my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ement into a pre&s;ent means of bare &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. I pa&s;&s;ed among the harmle&s;s pea&s;ants of Flanders, and among &s;uch of the French as were poor enough to be very merry; for I ever found them &s;prightly in pro|portion to their wants. Whenever I approached a pea|&s;ant's hou&s;e towards night-fall, I played one of my mo&s;t merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the next day. I once or twice at|tempted to play for people of fa&s;hion; but they &s;till thought my performance odious, and never rewarded me even with a trifle. This was to me the more extra|ordinary, as whenever I u&s;ed formerly to play for com|pany, when playing was my amu&s;ement, my mu&s;ic never
<PB N="105" REF="012405_0103_0F897321F13A62F0">
failed to throw them into raptures, and the ladies e&s;pe|cially; but as it was now my only means, it was receiv|ed with contempt: a proof how ready the world is to under-rate tho&s;e talents which a man lives by.</P>
<P>In this manner I proceeded to Paris, with no de&s;ign but ju&s;t to look about me, and then to go forward. The people of Paris are much fonder of &s;trangers that have money, than of tho&s;e that have wit. You may imagine then, as I could not boa&s;t much of either, that I was no great favourite. After I had walked about the town four or five days, and &s;een the out&s;ides of the be&s;t hou&s;es, I was preparing to leave this retreat of venal ho&s;pitality, when pa&s;&s;ing through one of the principal &s;treets, whom &s;hould I meet but our cou&s;in, to whom you fir&s;t recom|mended me. This meeting was very agreeable to me, and I believe not di&s;plea&s;ing to him. He enquired into the nature of my journey to Paris, and informed me of his bu&s;ine&s;s there, which was to collect pictures, medals, in|taglios, and antiques of all kinds, for a gentleman in London, who had ju&s;t &s;tept into ta&s;te and a large for|tune. I was &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing our cou&s;in pitched upon for this office, as him&s;elf had often a&s;&s;ured me he knew nothing of the matter. Upon my a&s;king how he had been taught the art of a conno&s;cento &s;o very &s;uddenly, he a&s;&s;ured me that nothing was more ea&s;y. The whole &s;ecret con&s;i&s;ted in a &s;trict adherence to two rules: the one always to ob&s;erve, that the picture might have been better if the painter had taken more pains; and the other, to prai&s;e the works of Pietro&punc; Perugino. But, &s;ays he, as I once taught you how to be an author in London, I'll now undertake to in&s;truct you in the art of picture buying at Paris.</P>
<P>With this propo&s;al I very readily clo&s;ed, as it was a living, and now all my ambition was to live. I went therefore to his lodgings, improved my dre&s;s by his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and after &s;ome time, accompanied him to auc|tions of pictures&punc; where the Engli&s;h gentry were expect|ed to be purcha&s;ers. I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at his intimacy with people of the be&s;t fa&s;hion, who referred them&s;elves to his judgment upon every picture or medal, as to an unerring &s;tandard of ta&s;te. He made very good u&s;e of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance upon the&s;e occa&s;ions; for when a&s;k|ed
<PB N="106" REF="012405_0104_0F897322B308E160">
his opinion, he would gravely take me a&s;ide, and a&s;k mine, &s;hrug, look wi&s;e, return, and a&s;&s;ure the company, that he could give no opinion upon an affair of &s;o much importance. Yet there was &s;ometimes an occa&s;ion for a more &s;upported a&s;&s;urance. I remember to have &s;een him, after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mellow enough, very deliberately take a bru&s;h with brown varni&s;h, that was accidently lying in the place, and rub it over the piece with great compo&s;ure before all the company, and then a&s;k if he had not im|proved the tints.</P>
<P>When he had fini&s;hed his commi&s;&s;ion in Paris, he left me &s;trongly recommended to &s;everal men of di&s;tinction, as a per&s;on very proper for a travelling tutor; and I was after &s;ome time employed in that capacity by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris, in order to &s;et him for|ward on his tour through Europe. I was to be the young gentleman's governor, with this injunction, that he &s;hould always be permitted to direct him&s;elf. My pu|pil in fact under&s;tood the art of guiding in money con|cerns much better than I. He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thou&s;and pounds, left him by an un|cle in the We&s;t-Indies; and his guardians, to qualify him for the management of it, had bound him appren|tice to an attorney. Thus avarice was his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion: all his que&s;tions on the road were, how money might be &s;aved; which was the lea&s;t expen&s;ive cour&s;e of travel; whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when di&s;po&s;ed of again in London. Such curio&s;ities on the way as could be &s;een for nothing he was ready enough to look at; but if the &s;ight was to be paid for, he u&s;ually a&s;&s;erted that he had been told it was not worth &s;eeing. He never paid a bill, that he would not ob&s;erve, how amazingly expen&s;ive travelling was, and all this though he was not yet come to the age of twenty-one. When arrived at Leghorn, as we took a walk to look at the port and &s;hipping, he enquired the expence of the pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea home to England. This he was in|formed was but a trifle, compared to his returning by land, he was therefore unable to with&s;tand the temptati|on; &s;o paying me the &s;mall part of my &s;alary that was then due, he took leave, and embarked with only one attendant for London.</P>

The company &s;eemed not much to di&s;approve of me for an a&s;&s;ociate. They all, howe|ver, apprized me of the importance of the ta&s;k at which I aimed; that the public was a many headed mon&s;ter, and that only &s;uch as had very good heads could plea&s;e it: that acting was not to be learned in a day; and that without &s;ome traditional &s;hrugs, which had been on the &s;tage, and only on the &s;tage, the&s;e hundred years, I could never pretend to plea&s;e. The next difficulty was in fitting me with parts, as almo&s;t every character was in keeping. I was driven, for &s;ome time, from one cha|racter to another, till at la&s;t Horatio was fixed upon, which the pre&s;ence of the pre&s;ent company happily hindered me from acting."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The &s;hort continuance of friend&s;hip among&s;t the vicious, which is coeval only with mutual &s;atisfaction.</HEAD>
<P>MY &s;on's account was too long to be delivered at once, the fir&s;t part of it was begun that night, and he was concluding the re&s;t after dinner the next day, when the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equipage at the door &s;eemed to make a pau&s;e in the ge|neral &s;atisfaction. The butler, who was now become my friend in the family, informed me with a whi&s;per, that the 'Squire had already made &s;ome overtures to Mi&s;s Wilmot, and that her aunt and uncle &s;eemed high|ly to approve the match. Upon Mr. Thornhill's enter|ing, he &s;eemed, at &s;eeing my &s;on and me, to &s;tart back; but I readily imputed that to &s;urprize, and not di&s;plea|&s;ure. However, upon our advancing to &s;alute him, he returned our greeting with the mo&s;t apparent candour; and after a &s;hort time, his pre&s;ence &s;eemed only to en|crea&s;e the general good humour.</P>
<P>After tea he called me a&s;ide, to enquire after my daughter; but upon my informing him that my en|quiry was un&s;ucce&s;sful, he &s;eemed greatly &s;urpri&s;ed; adding, that he had been &s;ince frequently at my hou&s;e, in order to comfort the re&s;t of my family, whom he left perfectly well. He then a&s;ked if I had communicated her misfortune to Mi&s;s Wilmot, or my &s;on; and upon my replying that I had not told them as yet, he greatly approved my prudence and precaution, de&s;iring me by all means to keep it a &s;ecret; "For at be&s;t," cried he,
<Q>it is but divulging one's own infamy; and perhaps Mi&s;s Livy may not be &s;o guilty as we all imagine.</Q> We were here interrupted by a &s;ervant, who came to a&s;k the 'Squire in, to &s;tand up at country dances; &s;o that he left me quite plea&s;ed with the intere&s;t he &s;eemed to take in my concerns. His ad|dre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="109" REF="012405_0107_0F8973255334EA78">
however, to Mi&s;s Wilmot, were too obvious to be mi&s;taken; and yet &s;he &s;eemed not perfectly plea&s;ed, but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her aunt, than from real inclination. I had even the &s;atis|faction to &s;ee her lavi&s;h &s;ome kind looks upon my unfor|tunate &s;on, which the other could neither extort by his fortune nor a&s;&s;iduity. Mr. Thornhill's &s;eeming compo|&s;ure, however, not a little &s;urpri&s;ed me: we had now continued here a week, at the pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances of Mr. Arnold; but each day the more tenderne&s;s Mi&s;s Wilmot &s;hewed my &s;on, Mr. Thornhill's friend&s;hip &s;eemed pro|portionably to encrea&s;e for him.</P>
<P>He had formerly made us the mo&s;t kind a&s;&s;urances of u&s;ing his intere&s;t to &s;erve the family; but now his genero&s;ity was not confined to promi&s;es alone: the morning I de&s;igned for my departure, Mr. Thorn|hill came to me with looks of real plea&s;ure to inform me of a piece of &s;ervice he had done for his friend George. This was nothing le&s;s than his having pro|cured him an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion in one of the regi|ments that was going to the We&s;t-Indies, for which he had promi&s;ed but one hundred pounds, his intere&s;t having been &s;ufficient to get an abatement of the other two. "As for this trifling piece of &s;ervice," continued the young gentleman,
<Q>I de&s;ire no other reward but the plea&s;ure of having &s;erved my friend; and as for the hundred pound to be paid, if you are unable to rai&s;e it your&s;elves, I will advance it, and you &s;hall repay me at your lei&s;ure.</Q> This was a favour we wanted words to expre&s;s our &s;en&s;e of: I readily therefore gave my bond for the money, and te&s;tified as much gratitude as if I never intended to pay.</P>
<P>George was to depart for town the next day to &s;ecure his commi&s;&s;ion, in pur&s;uance of his generous pa|tron's directions, who judged it highly expedient to u&s;e di&s;patch, le&s;t in the mean time another &s;hould &s;tep in with more advantageous propo&s;als. The next morn|ing, therefore, our young &s;oldier was early prepared for his departure, and &s;eemed the only per&s;on among us that was not affected by it. Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter, nor the friends and

mi&s;tre&s;s, for Mi&s;s Wilmot actually loved him, he was leaving behind, any way damped his &s;pirits. After he had taken leave, of the re&s;t of the company, I gave him all I had, my ble&s;&s;ing. "And now, my boy," cried I,
<Q>thou art going to fight for thy country, remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his &s;acred king, when loyalty among Britons was a virtue. Go, my boy, and imitate him in all but his misfortunes, if it was a misfortune to die with Lorld Falkland. Go, my boy, and if you fall, tho' di&s;tant, expo&s;ed and un|wept by tho&s;e that love you, the mo&s;t precious tears are tho&s;e with which heaven bedews the unburied head of a &s;oldier.</Q></P>
<P>The next morning I took leave of the good fa|mily, that had been kind enough to entertain me &s;o long, not without &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to Mr. Thornhill for his late bounty. I left them in the enjoyment of all that happine&s;s which affluence and good breeding procure, and returned towards home, de&s;pairing of ever finding my daughter more, but &s;end|ing a &s;igh to heaven to &s;pare and to forgive her. I was now come within about twenty miles of home, having hired an hor&s;e to carry me, as I was yet but weak, and comforted my&s;elf with the hopes of &s;oon &s;eeing all I held deare&s;t upon earth. But the night coming on, I put up at a little public hou&s;e by the road-&s;ide, and a&s;ked for the landlord's company over a pint of wine. We &s;at be&s;ide his kitchen fire, which was the be&s;t room in the hou&s;e, and chatted on politics and the news of the country. We happened, among other topics, to talk of young 'Squire Thornhill, whom the ho&s;t a&s;&s;ured me was hated as much as an uncle of his, who &s;ometimes came down to the country, was loved. He went on to ob&s;erve, that he made it his whole &s;tudy to betray the daughters of &s;uch as received him to their hou&s;es, and after a fortnight or three weeks po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he turned them out unregarded and abandoned to the world. As we con|tinued our di&s;cour&s;e in this manner, his wife, who had been out to get change, returned, and perceiving that her hu&s;band was enjoying a plea&s;ure in which &s;he was not a &s;harer, &s;he a&s;ked him, in an angry tone, what
<PB N="111" REF="012405_0109_0F89732733F9A618">
he did there, to which he only replied in an ironical way by drinking her health. "Mr. Symmonds," cried &s;he,
<Q>you u&s;e me very ill, and I'll bear it no longer. Here three parts of the bu&s;ine&s;s is left for me to do, and the fourth left unfini&s;hed; while you do nothing but &s;oak with the gue&s;ts all day long, where|as if a &s;poonful of liquor were to cure me of a fever, I never touch a drop.</Q> I now found what &s;he would be at, and immediately poured her out a gla&s;s, which &s;he received with a curte&s;y, and drinking towards my good health, "Sir," re&s;umed &s;he,
<Q>it is not &s;o much for the value of the liquor I am angry, but one can|not help it, when the hou&s;e is going out of the win|dows. If the cu&s;tomers or gue&s;ts are to be dunned, all the burthen lies upon my back, he'd as lief eat that gla&s;s as budge after them him&s;elf. There now above &s;tairs, we have a young woman who has come to take up her lodgings here, and I don't believe &s;he has got any money by her over civility. I am certain &s;he is very &s;low of payment, and I wi&s;h &s;he were put in mind of it.</Q> &mdash;
<Q>What &s;ignifies minding her,</Q>
cried the ho&s;t, "if &s;he be &s;low, &s;he is &s;ure." &mdash;"I don't know that," replied the wife;
<Q>but I know that I am &s;ure &s;he has been here a fortnight, and we have not yet &s;een the cro&s;s of her money.</Q> &mdash;"I &s;uppo&s;e, my dear," cried he,
<Q>we &s;hall have it all in a lump.</Q> &mdash;"In a lump!" cried the other,
<Q>I hope we may get it any way; and that I am re&s;olved we &s;hall this very night, or out &s;he tramps, bag and baggage.</Q> &mdash;"Con&s;ider, my dear," cried the hu&s;|band,
<Q>&s;he is a gentlewoman, and de&s;erves more re|&s;pect.</Q> &mdash;"As for the matter of that," returned the ho&s;t|e&s;s,
<Q>gentle or &s;imple, out &s;he &s;hall p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck with a &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|rara. Gentry may be good things where they take, but for my part I never &s;aw much good of them at the &s;ign of the Harrow.</Q> &mdash;Thus &s;aying, &s;he ran up a narrow flight of &s;tairs, that went from the kitchen to a room over head, and I &s;oon perceived by the loudne&s;s of her voice, and the bitterne&s;s of her re|proaches, that no money was to be had from her lodger. I could hear her remon&s;trances very di&s;tinctly&punc; "Out, I &s;ay, pack out this moment, tramp, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

famous &s;trumpet, or I'll give thee a mark thou won't be the better for this three months. What! you trumpery, to come and take up an hone&s;t hou&s;e, without cro&s;s or coin to ble&s;s your&s;elf with; come along, I &s;ay."&mdash;"O dear madam," cried the &s;tranger, "pity me, a poor a|bandoned creature for one night, and death will &s;oon do the re&s;t."&mdash;I in&s;tantly knew the voice of my poor ruin|ed child Olivia. I flew to her re&s;cue, while the woman was dragging her along by the hair, and caught the dear forlorn wretch in my arms.&mdash;"Welcome, any way welcome, my deare&s;t lo&s;t one, my trea&s;ure, to your poor old father's bo&s;om. Tho' the vicious for&s;ake thee, there is yet one in the world that will never for&s;ake thee; tho' thou had&s;t ten thou&s;and crimes to an&s;wer for, he will forget them all."&mdash;"O my own dear"&mdash;for minutes &s;he could no more&mdash;"my own deare&s;t good papa! Could angels be kinder! How do I de&s;erve &s;o much! The villain, I hate him and my&s;elf, to be a reproach to &s;uch goodne&s;s. You can't forgive me, I know you can|not."&mdash;"Yes, my child, from my heart I do forgive thee! Only repent, and we both &s;hall yet be happy. We &s;hall &s;ee many plea&s;ant days yet, my Olivia!"&mdash;"Ah! never, &s;ir, never. The re&s;t of my wretched life mu&s;t be infamy abroad and &s;hame at home. But, alas! papa, you look much paler than you u&s;ed to do. Could &s;uch a thing as I am give you &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s? Sure you have too much wi&s;dom to ta&s;te the mi&s;eries of my guilt upon your&s;elf."&mdash;"Our wi&s;dom, young woman," re|plied I.&mdash;"Ah, why &s;o cold a name, papa&punc;" cried &s;he. "This is the fir&s;t time you ever called me by &s;o cold a name"&mdash;I a&s;k pardon, my darling," returned I; "but I was going to ob&s;erve, that wi&s;dom makes but a &s;low defence again&s;t trouble, though at la&s;t a &s;ure one."</P>
<P>The landlady now returned to know if we did not chu&s;e a more genteel apartment, to which a&s;&s;enting, we were &s;hewn a room, where we could conver&s;e more free|ly. After we had talked our&s;elves into &s;ome degree of tranquillity, I could not avoid de&s;iring &s;ome account of the gradations that led to her pre&s;ent wretched &s;ituation. "That villain, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "from the fir&s;t day of our meeting made me honourable, though private, propro|&s;als."</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="012405_0111_0F897328B3268350">"Villain indeed," cried I; "and yet it in &s;ome mea|&s;ure &s;urpri&s;es me, how a per&s;on of Mr. Burchell's good &s;en&s;e and &s;eeming honour could be guilty of &s;uch delibe|rate ba&s;ene&s;s, and thus &s;tep into a family to undo it."</P>
<P>"My dear papa," returned my daughter, "you la|bour under a &s;trange mi&s;take, Mr. Burchell never at|tempted to deceive me. In&s;tead of that he took every opportunity of privately admoni&s;hing me again&s;t the ar|tifices of Mr. Thornhill&punc; who now I find was even wor&s;e than he repre&s;ented him."&mdash;"Mr. Thornhill," inter|rupted I, "can it be?"&mdash;"Yes, Sir," returned &s;he, "it was Mr. Thornhill who &s;educed me, who employ|ed the two ladies, as he called them, but who, in fact, were abandoned women of the town, without breeding or pity, to decoy us up to London. Their artifices, you may remember, would have certainly &s;ucceeded, but for Mr. Burchell's letter, who directed tho&s;e reproaches at them, which we all applied to our&s;elves. How he came to have &s;o much influence as to defeat their intenti|ons, &s;till remains a &s;ecret to me; but I am convinced he was ever our warme&s;t, &s;incere&s;t friend."</P>
<P>"You amaze me, my dear," cried I; "but now I find my fir&s;t &s;u&s;picions of Mr. Thornhill's ba&s;ene&s;s were too well grounded: but he can triumph in &s;ecurity; for he is rich and we are poor. But tell me, my child, &s;ure it was no &s;mall temptation that could thus obliterate all the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch an education, and &s;o virtuous a di&s;po&s;ition as thine."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir," replied &s;he, "he owes all his triumph to the de&s;ire I had of making him, and not my&s;elf, hap|py. I knew that the ceremony of our marriage, which was privately performed by a popi&s;h prie&s;t, was no way binding, and that I had nothing to tru&s;t to but his ho|nour." "What," interrupted I, "and were you in|deed married by a prie&s;t, and in orders."&mdash;"Indeed. Sir, we were," replied &s;he, "though we were both &s;worn to conceal his name."&mdash;"Why then, my child, come to my arms again, and now you are a thou&s;and times more welcome than before: for you are now his wife to all intents and purpo&s;es: nor can all the laws of man, tho' written upon tables of adamant, le&s;&s;en the force of that &s;acred connexion."</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="012405_0112_0F89732972D85798">"Alas, papa," replied &s;he, "you are but little ac|quainted with his villainies: he has been married alrea|dy, by the &s;ame prie&s;t, to &s;ix or eight wives more, whom, like me, he has deceived and abandoned."</P>
<P>"Has he &s;o?" cried I, "then we mu&s;t hang the prie&s;t, and you &s;hall inform again&s;t him to morrow."&mdash; "But, Sir," returned &s;he, "will that be right, when I am &s;worn to &s;ecrecy?"&mdash;"My dear," I replied, "if you have made &s;uch a promi&s;e, I cannot, nor will not, tempt you to break it. Even tho' it may benefit the pub|lic, you mu&s;t not inform again&s;t him. In all human in|&s;titutions a &s;maller evil is allowed to procure a greater good; as in politics, a province may be given away to &s;e|cure a kingdom; in medicine, a limb may be lopt off, to pre&s;erve the body. But in religion the law is written, and inflexible, <HI>never</HI> to do evil. And this law, my child, is right: for otherwi&s;e, if we commit a &s;maller evil, to procure a greater good, certain guilt would be thus in|curred, in expectation of contingent advantage. And though the advantage &s;hould certainly follow, yet the in|terval between commi&s;&s;ion and advantage, which is al|lowed to be guilty, may be that in which we are called away to an&s;wer for the things we have done, and the volume of human actions is clo&s;ed for ever. But I inter|rupt you, my dear, go on."</P>
<P>"The very next morning," continued &s;he, "I found what little expectations I was to have from his &s;incerity. That very morning he introduced me to two unhappy women more, whom, like me, he had deceived, but who lived in contented pro&s;titution. I loved him too tender|ly to bear &s;uch rivals in his affections, and &s;trove to for|get my infamy in a tumult of plea&s;ures. With this view, I danced, dre&s;&s;ed, and talked; but &s;till was unhappy. The gentlemen who vi&s;ited there, told me every moment of the power of my charms, and this only contributed to encrea&s;e my melancholy, as I had thrown all their pow|er quite away. Thus each day I grew more pen&s;ive, and he more in&s;olent, till at la&s;t the mon&s;ter had the a&s;&s;ur|ance to offer me to a young Baronet of his acquaintance. Need I de&s;cribe, Sir, how his ingratitude &s;tung me? My an&s;wer to this propo&s;al was almo&s;t madne&s;s. I de&s;ired to part. As I was going he offered me a pur&s;e; but I flung
<PB N="115" REF="012405_0113_0F89732A3394A2B8">
it at him with indignation, and bur&s;t from him in a rage, that for a while kept me in&s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;eries of my &s;ituation. But I &s;oon looked round me, and &s;aw my&s;elf a vile, abject, guilty thing, without one friend in the world to apply to.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t in that interval, a &s;tage-coach happening to pa&s;s by, I took a place, it being my only aim to be driven at a di&s;tance from a wretch I de&s;pi&s;ed and dete&s;ted. I was &s;et down here, where, &s;ince my arrival, my own anxiety, and this woman's unkindne&s;s, have been my on|ly companions. The hours of plea&s;ure that I have pa&s;&s;|ed with my mamma and &s;i&s;ter, now grow painful to me. Their &s;orrows are much; but mine are greater than theirs; for mine are guilt and infamy."</P>
<P>"Have patience, my child," cried I, "and I hope things will yet be better. Take &s;ome repo&s;e to-night, and to-morrow I'll carry you home to your mother, and the re&s;t of the family, from whom you will receive a kind reception. Poor woman, this has gone to her heart: but &s;he loves you &s;till, Olivia, and will forget it."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Offences are ea&s;ily pardoned where there is love at bottom.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning I took my daughter behind me, and &s;et out on my return home. As we travelled along, I &s;trove by every per&s;ua&s;ion, to calm her &s;orrows and fears, and to arm her with re&s;olu|tion to bear the pre&s;ence of her offended mother. I took every opportunity, from the pro&s;pect of a fine country, through which we pa&s;&s;ed to ob&s;erve how much kinder Heaven was to us, than we were to each other, and that the misfortunes of nature's making were very few. I a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he &s;hould never per|ceive any change in my affections, and that during my life, which yet might be long, &s;he might depend upon a guardian and an in&s;tructor. I armed her again&s;t the cen&s;ures of the world, &s;hewed her, that books were &s;weet unreproaching companions to the mi&s;erable, and that if they could not bring us to en|joy life, they would teach us to endure it.</P>
<P>The hired hor&s;e that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the way, within about five miles from my hou&s;e, and as I was willing to prepare my family for my daughter's reception, I determined to leave her that night at the inn, and to come for her, acompanied by my daughter Sophia, early the next morning. It was night before we reached our appointed &s;tage: however, after &s;eeing her provided with a decent apartment, and having ordered the ho&s;te&s;s to prepare proper refre&s;h|ments, I ki&s;&s;ed her, and proceeded towards home. My heart caught new &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure the nearer I approached that peaceful man&s;ion. As a bird that has been frighted from its ne&s;t, my affections out-went my ha&s;te, and hovered round my little fire-&s;ide, with all the rapture of expectation. I called up the many
<PB N="117" REF="012405_0115_0F89732BB4E784A0">
fond things I had to &s;ay, and anticipated the welcome I was to receive. I already felt my wife's tender em|brace, and &s;miled at the joy of my little ones. As I walked but &s;lowly, the night waned apace. The labourers of the day were all retired to re&s;t; the lights were out in every cottage; no &s;ounds were heard but of the &s;hrilling cock, and the deep-mouthed watch-dog, at hollow di&s;tance. I approached my little abode of plea&s;ure, and before I was within a furlong of the place, our hone&s;t ma&s;tiff came running to welcome me.</P>
<P>It was now near mid-night that I came to knock at my door: all was &s;till and &s;ilent: my heart dilated with unutterable happine&s;s, when, to my amazement, the hou&s;e was bur&s;ting out in a blaze of fire, and every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perture was red with conflagration! I gave a loud con|vul&s;ive outcry, and fell upon the pavement in&s;en&s;ible. This alarmed my &s;on, who perceiving the flames, in|&s;tantly waked my wife and daughter, and all running, out naked, and wild with apprehen&s;ion, recalled me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ife with their angui&s;h. But it was only to objects of new terror; for the flames had, by this time, caught the roof of our dwelling, part after part continuing to fall in, while the family &s;tood, with &s;ilent agony, look|ing on, as if they enjoyed the blaze. I gazed upon them and upon it by turns, and then looked round me for my two little ones; but they were not to be &s;een. O mi&s;ery! "Where," cried I,
<Q>where are my little ones?</Q> &mdash;"They are burnt to death in the flames," &s;ays my wife calmly, "and I will die with them."&mdash; That moment I heard the cry of the babes within, who were ju&s;t awaked by the fire, and nothing could have &s;topped me. "Where, where, are my children?" cried I, ru&s;hing through the flames, and bur&s;ting the door of the chamber in which they were confined, "Where are my little ones?"&mdash; <Q>Here, dear-papa, here we are,</Q> cried they together, while the flames were ju&s;t catching the bed where they lay. I caught them both in my arms and &s;natched them through the fire as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, while ju&s;t as I got out, the roof &s;unk in. "Now," cried I, holding up my children,
<Q>now let the flames burn on, and all my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions

peri&s;h. Here they are, I have &s;aved my trea&s;ure. Here, my deare&s;t, here are our trea&s;ures, and we &s;hall yet be happy.</Q> We ki&s;&s;ed our little darlings a thou|&s;and times, they cla&s;ped us round the neck, and &s;eemed to &s;hare our tran&s;ports, while their mother laughed and wept by turns.</P>
<P>I now &s;tood a calm &s;pectator of the flames, and, af|ter &s;ome time began to perceive that my arm to the &s;houlder was &s;corched in a terrible manner. It was therefore out of my power to give my &s;on any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, either in attempting to &s;ave our goods, or preventing the flames &s;preading to our corn. By this time, the neighbours were alarmed, and came running to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but all they could do was to &s;tand, like us, &s;pectators of the calamity. My goods, among which were the notes I had re&s;erved for my daughters for|tunes, were entirely con&s;umed, except a box, with &s;ome papers, that &s;tood in the kitchen, and two or three things more of little con&s;equence, which my &s;on brought away in the beginning. The neighbours contributed, however what they could to lighten our di&s;tre&s;s. They brought us cloaths, and furni&s;hed one of our out-hou&s;es with kitchen uten&s;ils; &s;o that by day-light we had another, tho' a wretched dwelling to retire to. My hone&s;t next neighbour, and his chil|dren were not the lea&s;t a&s;&s;iduous in providing us with every thing nece&s;&s;ary, and offering whatever con&s;olati|on untuto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed benevolence could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>When the fears of my family had &s;ub&s;ided, curio&s;ity to know the cau&s;e of my long &s;tay began to take place; having therefore informed them of every particular, I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lo&s;t one; and tho' we had nothing but wretchedne&s;s now to impart, yet to procure her a welcome to what we had. This ta&s;k would have been more difficult but for o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. None but the guilty can be long and completely mi&s;erable.</HEAD>
<P>SOME a&s;&s;iduity was now required to make our pre|&s;ent abode as convenient as po&s;&s;ible, and we were &s;oon again qualified to enjoy our former &s;erenity. Being di&s;abled my&s;elf from a&s;&s;i&s;ting my &s;on in our u&s;ual occu|pations, I read to my family from the few books that were &s;aved, and particularly from &s;uch, as, by amu&s;ing the imagination, contributed to ea&s;e the heart. Our good neighbours too came every day with the kinde&s;t condolence, and fixed a time in which they were all to a&s;&s;i&s;t at repairing my former dwelling. Hone&s;t farmer Williams was not la&s;t among the&s;e vi&s;itors; but hear|tily offered his friend&s;hip. He would even have re|newed his addre&s;&s;es to my daughter; but &s;he rejected them in &s;uch a manner as totally repre&s;&s;ed his future &s;o|licitations. Her grief &s;eemed formed for continuing, and &s;he was the only per&s;on of our little &s;ociety that a week did not re&s;tore to chearfulne&s;s. She now lo&s;t that unblu&s;hing innocence which once taught her to re&s;pect her&s;elf, and to &s;eek plea&s;ure by plea&s;ing. Anxiety now had taken &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, her beauty began to be impared with her con&s;titution, and neglect &s;till more contributed to dimini&s;h it. Every tender epi|thet, be&s;towed on her &s;i&s;ter brought a pang to her heart and a tear to her eye; and as one vice, tho' cured, al|mo&s;t ever plants others where it has been, &s;o her former guilt, tho' driven out by repentance, left jealou&s;y and envy behind. I &s;trove a thou&s;and ways to le&s;&s;en he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

care, and even forgot my own pain in a concern for her's, collecting &s;uch amu&s;ing pa&s;&s;ages of hi&s;tory, as a &s;trong memory and &s;ome reading could &s;ugge&s;t.
<Q>Our happine&s;s, my dear,</Q> I would &s;ay,
<Q>is in the power of one who can bring it about a thou&s;and unfore&s;een ways, that mock our fore&s;ight. If example be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to prove this, I'll give you a &s;tory, my child, told us by a grave, tho' &s;ometimes a romancing, hi&s;torian.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Matilda was married very young to a Neapolitan nobleman of the fir&s;t quality, and found her&s;elf a widow and a mother at the age of fifteen. As &s;he &s;tood one day care&s;&s;ing her infant &s;on in the open window of an apartment, which hung over the river Volturna, the child, with a &s;udden &s;pring leaped from her arms into the flood below, and di&s;appeared in a moment. The mother, &s;truck with in&s;tant &s;ur|prize, and making an effort to &s;ave him, plunged in after; but, far from being able to a&s;&s;i&s;t the infant, &s;he her&s;elf with great difficulty e&s;caped to the op|po&s;ite &s;hore, ju&s;t when &s;ome French &s;oldiers were plundering the country on that &s;ide, who immediate|ly made her their pri&s;oner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians with the utmo&s;t inhumanity, they were going at once to perpetrate tho&s;e two extremes, &s;ugge&s;ted by appetite and cruelty. This ba&s;e re&s;o|lution, however, was oppo&s;ed by a young officer, who, tho' their retreat required the utmo&s;t expedition, placed her behind him, and brought her in &s;afety to his native city. Her beauty at fir&s;t caught his eye, her merit &s;oon after his heart. They were married; he ro&s;e to the highe&s;t po&s;ts; they lived long together, and were happy. But the &s;elicity of a &s;oldier can never be called permanent: after an interval of &s;eve|ral years the troops, which he commanded having met with a repul&s;e, he was obliged to take &s;helter in the city where he had lived with his wife. Here they &s;uffered a &s;iege, and the city at length was taken. Few hi&s;tories can produce more various in&s;tances of cruelty, than tho&s;e which the French and Italians at
<PB N="122" REF="012405_0120_0F8973303335CD60">
that time exerci&s;ed upon each other. It was re&s;olved by the victors, upon this occa&s;ion, to put all the French pri&s;oners to death; but particularly the hu&s;band of the unfortunate Matilda, as he was prin|cipally in&s;trumental in protracting the &s;iege. Their determinations were, in general executed almo&s;t as &s;oon as re&s;olved upon. The captive &s;oldier was led forth, and the executioner, with his &s;word, &s;tood ready, while the &s;pectators in gloomy &s;ilence awaited the fatal blow, which was only &s;u&s;pended till the ge|neral, who pre&s;ided as judge, &s;hould give the &s;ignal. It was in this interval of angui&s;h and expectation, that Matilda came to take her la&s;t farewell of her hu&s;band and deliverer, deploring her wretched &s;ituation and the cruelty of fate, that had &s;aved her from peri&s;hing by a premature death in the river Volturna, to be the &s;pectator of &s;till greater calamities. The general, who was a young man, was &s;truck with &s;urprize at her beauty, and pity at her di&s;tre&s;s; but with &s;till &s;tronger emotions when he heard her mention her former dangers. He was her &s;on, the infant for whom &s;he had encountred &s;o much danger. He acknowledged her at once as his mother and fell at her feet. The re&s;t may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed: the cap|tive was &s;et free, and all the happine&s;s that love, friend&s;hip, and duty could confer on each, were united.</Q></P>
<P>In this manner I would attempt to amu&s;e my daugh|ter; but &s;he li&s;tened with divided attention; for her own misfortunes engro&s;&s;ed all the pity &s;he once had for tho&s;e of another, and nothing gave her ea&s;e. In com|pany &s;he dreaded contempt: and in &s;olitude &s;he only found anxiety. Such was the colour of her wretched|ne&s;s, when we received certain information, that Mr. Thornhill was going to be married to Mi&s;s Wilmot, for whom I always &s;u&s;pected he had a real pa&s;&s;ion, tho' he took every opportunity before me to expre&s;s his con|tempt both of her per&s;on and fortune. This news only &s;erved to encrea&s;e poor Olivia's affliction; &s;uch a fla|grant breach of fidelity, was more than her courage could
<PB N="123" REF="012405_0121_0F897330F2ED27B8">
&s;upport. I was re&s;olved, however, to get more certain information, and to defeat, if po&s;&s;ible, the completion of his de&s;igns, by &s;ending my &s;on to old Mr. Wilmot's, with in&s;tructions to know the truth of the report, and to deliver Mi&s;s Wilmot a letter, intimating Mr. Thornhill's conduct in my family. My &s;on went, in pur&s;uance of my directions, and in three days returned, a&s;&s;uring us of the truth of the account; but that he had found it impo&s;&s;ible to deliver the letter, which he was therefore obliged to leave, as Mr. Thornhill and Mi&s;s Wilmot were vi&s;iting round the country. They were to be mar|ried, he &s;aid, in a few days, having appeared together at church the Sunday before he was there, in great &s;plendour, the bride attended by &s;ix young ladies dre&s;&s;ed in white, and he by as many gentlemen. Their ap|proaching nuptials filled the whole country with re|joicing, and they u&s;ually rode out together in the grand|e&s;t equipage that had been &s;een in the country for many years. All the friends of both families, he &s;aid, were there, particularly the 'Squire's uncle, Sir William Thornhill, who bore &s;o good a character. He added, that nothing but mirth and fea&s;ting were going for|ward; that all the country prai&s;ed the young bride's beauty and the bridegroom's fine per&s;on, and that they were immen&s;ely fond of each other; concluding, that he could not help thinking Mr. Thornhill one of the mo&s;t happy men in the world.</P>
<P>"Why let him if he can," returned I:
<Q>but, my &s;on, ob&s;erve this bed of &s;traw, and un&s;heltering roof; tho&s;e mouldering walls, and humid floor; my wretch|ed body thus di&s;abled by fire, and my children weeping round me for bread; you have come home, my child, to all this, yet here, even here you &s;ee a man that would not for a thou&s;and worlds ex|change &s;ituations. O, my children, if you could but learn to commune with your own hearts, and know what noble company you can make them, you would little regard the elegance and &s;plendours of the worthle&s;s. Almo&s;t all men have been taught to call life a pa&s;&s;age and them&s;elves the travellers. The &s;imilitude &s;till may be improved when we ob&s;erve that

I bade her mother &s;upport her, and after a &s;hort time &s;he recovered. She appeared from this time more calm, and I imagined had gained a new degree of re&s;olution: but appearances deceived me: for her tran|quillity was the languor of over wrought re&s;entment. A &s;upply of provi&s;ions, charitably &s;ent us by my kind pari&s;hioners, &s;eemed to diffu&s;e chearfulne&s;s among&s;t the re&s;t of the family, nor was I di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;eeing them once more &s;prightly and at ea&s;e. It would have been unju&s;t to damp their &s;atisfactions, merely to condole with re&s;olute melancholy, or to burthen them with a &s;adne&s;s they did not feel. Once more therefore, the tale went round and the &s;ong was demanded, and chear|fulne&s;s conde&s;cended to hover round our little habi|tation.</P>

<P><PB N="126" REF="012405_0124_0F8973333356DA50">As &s;he was concluding the la&s;t &s;tanza, to which an interruption in her voice from &s;orrow gave peculiar &s;oftne&s;s, the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equipage at a di&s;tance alarmed us all, but particularly encrea&s;ed the unea&s;ine&s;s of my elde&s;t daughter, who, de&s;irous of &s;hun|ning her betrayer, returned to the hou&s;e with her &s;i&s;ter. In a few minutes he was alighted from his cha|riot, and making up to the place where I was &s;till &s;it|ting, enquired after my health with his u&s;ual air of fa|miliarity." Sir, "replied I,
<Q>your pre&s;ent a&s;&s;urance only &s;erves to aggravate the ba&s;ene&s;s of your character; and there was a time when I would have cha&s;ti&s;ed your in&s;olence, for pre&s;uming thus to appear before me. But now you are &s;afe; for age has cooled my pa&s;&s;ions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d my calling re&s;trains them.</Q></P>
<P>"I vow, my dear &s;ir," returned he,
<Q>I am amazed at all this; nor can I under&s;tand what it means! I hope you don't think your daughter's late excur&s;ion with me had any thing criminal in it.</Q></P>
<P>"Go," cried I,
<Q>thou art a wretch, a poor pitiful wretch, and every way a liar; but your meanne&s;s &s;ecures you from my anger! Yet, &s;ir, I am de&s;cended from a family that would not have borne this! And &s;o, thou vile thing, to gratify a momentary pa&s;&s;ion, thou ha&s;t made one poor creature wretched for life, and polluted a family that had nothing but honour for their portion.</Q></P>
<P>"If &s;he or you," returned he, <Q>are re&s;olved to be mi&s;erable, I cannot help it. But you may &s;till be happy; and whatever opinion you may have formed of me, you &s;hall ever find me ready to contribute to it. We can readily marry her to another, and what is more, &s;he may keep her lover be&s;ide; for I prote&s;t I &s;hall ever continue to have a true regard for her.</Q></P>
<P>I found all my pa&s;&s;ions awakened at this new de|grading propo&s;al; for though the mind may often be calm under great injuries, little villainy can at any time get within the &s;oul, and &s;ting it into rage.&mdash; <Q>Avoid my &s;ight, thou reptile,</Q> cried I,
<Q>nor continue to in|&s;ult me with thy pre&s;ence. Were my brave &s;on at

home, he would not &s;uffer this; but I am old, and di&s;abled, and every way undone.</Q></P>
<P>"I find," cried he,
<Q>you are bent upon obliging me to talk in an har&s;her manner than I intended. But as I have &s;hewn you what may be hoped from my friend&s;hip, it may not be improper to repre&s;ent what may be the con&s;quences of my re&s;entment. My attorney, to whom your late bond has been tran&s;|ferred, threatens hard, nor do I know how to pre|vent the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, except by paying the mo|ney my&s;elf, which, as I have been at &s;ome expences lately, previous to my intended marriage, it is not &s;o ea&s;y to be done. And then my &s;teward talks of driving for the rent: it is certain he knows his duty; for I never trouble my&s;elf with affairs of that nature. Yet &s;till I could wi&s;h to &s;erve you, and even to have you and your daughter pre&s;ent at my marriage, which is &s;hortly to be &s;olemnized with Mi&s;s Wilmot: it is even the reque&s;t of my charming Arabella her|&s;elf, whom I hope you will not refu&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"Mr. Thornhill," replied I,
<Q>hear me once for all: as to your marriage with any but my daughter, that I never will con&s;ent to; or though your friend&s;hip could rai&s;e me to a throne, and your re&s;entment &s;ink me to the grave, yet would I de&s;pi&s;e both. Thou ha&s;t once wofully, irreparably deceived me. I re|po&s;ed my heart upon thine honour, and have found it's ba&s;ene&s;s. Never more, therefore, expect friend|&s;hip from me. Go and po&s;&s;e&s;s what fortune has given thee, beauty, riches, health, and plea&s;ure. Go, and leave me to want, infamy, di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;orrow. Yet humbled as I am, &s;hall my heart &s;till vindicate its dignity, and though thou ha&s;t my forgivene&s;s, thou &s;halt ever have my contempt.</Q></P>
<P>"If &s;o," returned he,
<Q>depend upon it you &s;hall feel the effects of this in&s;olence, and we &s;hall &s;hortly &s;ee which is the fitte&s;t object of &s;corn, you or I.</Q> &mdash; Upon which he departed abruptly.</P>
<P>My wife and &s;on, who were pre&s;ent at this interview, &s;eemed terrified with the apprehen&s;ion. My daughters al&s;o finding that he was gone, came out to be informed
<PB N="128" REF="012405_0126_0F8973358459A1D8">
of the re&s;ult of our conference, which, when known, alarmed them not le&s;s than the re&s;t. But as to my&s;elf I di&s;regarded the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of his malevolence: he had already &s;truck the blow, and now I &s;tood pre|pared to repel every new effort. Like one of tho&s;e in|&s;truments u&s;ed in the art of war, which, however, thrown, &s;till pre&s;ents a point to receive the enemy.</P>
<P>We &s;oon, however found that he had not threatened in vain; for the very next day his &s;teward came to de|mand my annual rent, which, by the train of accidents already related, I was unable to pay. The con&s;equence of my incapacity was his driving my cattle that evening, and their being apprai&s;ed and &s;old the next day for le&s;s than half their value. My wife and children now there|fore entreated me to comply upon any terms, rather than incur certain de&s;truction. They even begged of me to admit his vi&s;its once more, and u&s;ed all their little eloquence to paint the calamities I was going to endure: the terrors of a pri&s;on, in &s;o rigorous a &s;ea&s;on as the pre&s;ent, with the danger that threatened my health from the late accident that happened by the fire. But I continued inflexible.</P>
<P>"Why, my trea&s;ures," cried I,
<Q>why will you thus attempt to per&s;uade me to the thing that is not right! My duty has taught me to forgive him; but my con&s;cience will not permit me to approve. Would you have me applaud to the world what my heart mu&s;t internally condemn? Would you have me tamely &s;it down and flatter our infamous betrayer; and to avoid a pri&s;on continually &s;uffer the more galling bonds of mental confinement! No, never. If we are to be taken from this abode, only let us hold to the right, and wherever we are thrown, we can &s;till retire to a charming apartment, and look round our own hearts with intrepidity and with plea&s;ure!</Q></P>
<P>In this manner we &s;pent that evening. Early the next morning, as the &s;now had fallen in great ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|dance in the night, my &s;on was employed in clearing it away, and opening a pa&s;&s;age before the door. He had not been thus engaged long, when he came running in,
<PB N="129" REF="012405_0127_0F897336839148C8">
with looks all pale, to tell us that two &s;trangers, whom he knew to be officers of ju&s;tice, were making towards the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he &s;poke, they came in, and approaching the bed where I lay, after previou&s;ly informing me of their employment and bu&s;ine&s;s, made me their pri&s;oner, bid|ding me prepare to go with them to the county goal, which was eleven miles off.</P>
<P>"My friends," &s;aid I,
<Q>this is &s;evere weather on which you have come to take me to a pri&s;on; and it is particularly unfortunate at this time, as one of my arms has lately been burnt in a terrible manner, and it has thrown me into a &s;light fever, and I want cloaths to cover me, and I am now too weak and old to walk far in &s;uch deep &s;now: but if it mu&s;t be &s;o, I'll try to obey you.</Q></P>
<P>I then turned to my wife and children, and directed them to get together what few things were left us, and to prepare immediately for leaving this place. I en|treated them to be expeditious and de&s;ired my &s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t his elder &s;i&s;ter, who, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that &s;he was the cau&s;e of all our calamities, was fallen, and had lo&s;t angui&s;h in in&s;en&s;ibility. I encouraged my wife, who, pale and trembling, cla&s;ped our affrighted little ones in her arms, that clung to her bo&s;om in &s;ilence, dreading to look round at the &s;trangers. In the mean time my young+e&s;t daughter prepared for our departure, and as &s;he re+ceived &s;everal hints to u&s;e di&s;patch, in about an hour we were ready to depart.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. No &s;ituation, however wretched it &s;eems, but has &s;ome &s;ort of comfort attending it.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;et forward from this peaceful neighbourhood, and walked on &s;lowly. My elde&s;t daughter being enfeebled by a &s;low fever, which had begun for &s;ome days to undermine her con&s;titution, one of the officers, who had an hor&s;e, kindly took her behind him; for even the&s;e men cannot entirely dive&s;t them&s;elves of hu|manity. My &s;on led one of the little ones by the hand, and my wife the other, while I leaned upon my younge&s;t girl, who&s;e tears fell not for her own but my di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>We were now got from my late dwelling about two miles, when we &s;aw a crowd running and &s;houting be|hind us, con&s;i&s;ting of about fifty of my poore&s;t pari&s;hio|ners. The&s;e, with dreadful imprecations &s;oon &s;eized upon the two officers of ju&s;tice, and &s;wearing they would never &s;ee their mini&s;ter go to gaol while they had a drop of blood to &s;hed in his defence, were going to u&s;e them with great &s;everity. The con&s;equence might have been fatal, had I not immediately inter|po&s;ed, and with &s;ome difficulty re&s;cued the officers from the hands of the enraged multitude. My children who looked upon my delivery now as certain, appeared tran&s;|ported with joy, and were incapable of containing their raptures. But they were &s;oon undeceived, upon hear|ing me addre&s;s the poor deluded people, who came, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they imagined, to do me &s;ervice.</P>
<P>"What! my friends, cried I,
<Q>and is this th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> way you love me! Is this the manner you obey the

in&s;tructions I have given you from the pulpit! Thus to fly in the face of ju&s;tice, and bring down ruin on your&s;elves and me! Which is your ringleader? Shew me the man that has thus &s;educed you. As &s;ure as he lives he &s;hall feel my re&s;entment. Alas! my dear deluded flock, return back to the duty you owe to God, to your country and to me. I &s;hall yet per|haps one day &s;ee you in greater felicity here, and contribute to make your lives more happy. But let it at lea&s;t be my comfort when I pen my fold for im|mortality, that not one here &s;hall be wanting.</Q></P>
<P>They now &s;eemed all repentance, and melting into tears, came one after the other to bid me farewell. I &s;hook each tenderly by the hand, and leaving them my ble&s;&s;ing, proceeded forward without meeting any farther interruption. Some hours before night we reached the town, or rather village; for it con&s;i&s;ted but of a few mean hou&s;es, having lo&s;t all its former opulence, and re|taining no marks of its ancient &s;uperiority but the gaol.</P>
<P>Upon entering, we put up at an inn, where we had &s;uch refre&s;hments as could mo&s;t readily be procured, and I &s;upped with my family with my u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s. After &s;eeing them properly accomodated for that night, I next attended the &s;heriff's officers to the pri&s;on, which had formerly been built for the purpo&s;es of war, and con&s;i&s;ted of one large apartment, &s;trongly grated, and paved with &s;tone, common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the four and twenty. Be&s;ides this, every pri&s;oner had a &s;eparate cell, where he was locked in for the night.</P>
<P>I expected upon my enterance to find nothing but lamentations, and various &s;ounds of mi&s;ery; but it was very different. The pri&s;oners &s;eemed all employed in one common de&s;ign, that of forgetting thought in mer|riment or clamour. I was apprized of the u&s;ual per|qui&s;ite required upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, and immediately complied with the demand, though the little money I had was very near being all exhau&s;ted. This was immedi|ately &s;ent away for liquor, and the whole pri&s;on &s;oon was filled with riot, laughter, and prophanene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="012405_0130_0F89733874497F80">"How," cried I to my&s;elf,
<Q>&s;hall men &s;o very wicked be chearful, and &s;hall I be melancholy! I feel only the &s;ame confinement with them, and I think I have more rea&s;on to be happy.</Q></P>
<P>With &s;uch reflections I laboured to become chearful; but chearfulne&s;s was never yet produced by effort, which is it&s;elf painful. As I was &s;itting therefore in a corner of the gaol, in a pen&s;ive po&s;ture, one of my fellow pri&s;oners came up, and &s;itting by me, entered into conver&s;ation. It was my con&s;tant rule in life never to avoid the conver&s;ation of any man who &s;eemed to de&s;ire it: for if good, I might profit by his in&s;truction: if bad, he might be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by mine. I found this to be a knowing man, of &s;trong unlettered &s;en&s;e; but a thorough knowledge of the world, as it is called, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more properly &s;peaking, of human nature on the wrong &s;ide. He a&s;ked me if I had taken care to provide my|&s;elf with a bed, which was a circum&s;tance I had never once attended to.</P>
<P>"That's unfortunate," cried he,
<Q>as you are allow|ed here nothing but &s;traw, and your appartment is very large and cold. However, you &s;eem to be &s;omething of a gentleman, and as I have been one my&s;elf in my time, part of my bed-cloaths are hear|tily at your &s;ervice.</Q></P>
<P>I thanked him, profe&s;&s;ing my &s;urprize at finding &s;uch humanity in a gaol in misfortunes; adding, to let him &s;ee that I was a &s;cholar,
<Q>That the &s;age ancient &s;eemed to under&s;tand the value of company in affliction when he &s;aid, Ton ko&s;mon aire, ei dos ton etairon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and in fact,</Q> continued I,

&s;o much learning; but I think I have heard all this before. Have I not had the plea&s;ure of once &s;ee|ing you at Welbridge fair, and is not your name Ephra|im Jenkin&s;on?" At this demand he only &s;ighed. "I &s;uppo&s;e you mu&s;t recollect," re&s;umed I, "one Doctor Primro&s;e, from whom you bought a hor&s;e."</P>
<P>He now at once recollected me; for the gloomine&s;s of the place and the approaching night had prevented his di&s;tingui&s;hing my features before.&mdash;"Yes, Sir," returned Mr. Jenkin&s;on, "I remember you perfectly well, I bought an hor&s;e, but forgot to pay for him. Your neighbour Flamborough is the only pro&s;e|cutor I am any way afraid of at the next a&s;&s;izes: for he intends to &s;wear po&s;itively again&s;t me as a coiner. I am heartily &s;orry, Sir, I ever deceived you, or indeed any man: for you &s;ee," continued, he, &s;hewing his &s;hackles, "what my tricks have brought me to."</P>
<P>"Well, &s;ir," replied I, "your kindne&s;s in offering me a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when you could expect no return, &s;hall be repaid with my endeavours to &s;often or totally &s;up|pre&s;s Mr. Flamborough's evidence, and I will &s;end my &s;on to him for that purpo&s;e the fir&s;t opportunity; nor do I in the lea&s;t doubt but he will comply with my re|que&s;t, and as to my own evidence, you need be under no unea&s;ine&s;s about that."</P>
<P>"Well, &s;ir," cried he, "all the return I can make &s;hall be yours. You &s;hall have more than half my bed|cloaths to night, and I'll take care to &s;tand your friend in the pri&s;on, where I think I have &s;ome influence."</P>
<P>I thanked him, and could not avoid being &s;urpri&s;ed at the pre&s;ent youthful change in his a&s;pect, for at the time I had &s;een him before, he appeared at lea&s;t &s;ixty. &mdash;'Sir," an&s;wered he, "you are little acquainted with the world; I had at that time fal&s;e hair, and have learnt the art of counterfeiting every age from &s;even|teen to &s;eventy. Ah &s;ir, had I but be&s;towed half the pains in learning a trade, that I have in learning to be a &s;coundrel, I might have been a rich man at this day.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A reformation in the gaol. To make laws complete they &s;hould reward as well as puni&s;h.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning early I was awakened by my family, whom I found in tears at my bed-&s;ide. The gloomy-&s;trength of every thing about us, it &s;eems, had daunted them. I gently rebuked their &s;orrow, a&s;&s;uring them I had never &s;lept with greater tranquillity, and next enquired after my elde&s;t daughter, who was not among them. They informed me that ye&s;terday's unea&s;ine&s;s and fatigue had encrea&s;ed her fever, and it was judged proper to leave her behind. My next care was to &s;end my &s;on to procure a room or two to lodge the family in, as near the pri&s;on as conveniently could be found. He obeyed; but could only find one apartment, which was hired at a &s;mall expence, for his mother and &s;i&s;ters, the gaoler with humanity con&s;enting to let him and his two little brothers lie in the pri&s;on with me. A bed was therefore prepared for them in a corner of the room, which I thought an&s;wered very conveniently. I was willing however previou&s;ly to know whether my little children cho&s;e to lie in a place which &s;eemed to fright them upon entrance.</P>
<P>"Well," cried I, "my good boys, how do you like your bed? I hope you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears."</P>
<P>"No, papa" &s;ays Dick, "I am not afraid to lie any where, where you are."</P>
<P>"And I," &s;ays Bill, who was yet but four years old, "love every place be&s;t that my papa is in."</P>
<P>After this, I allotted to each of the family what they were to do. My daughter was particularly directed to watch her declining &s;i&s;ter's health; my wife was to at|tend
<PB N="136" REF="012405_0134_0F89733C48D7BBA0">
me; my little boys were to read to me: "And as for you, my &s;on," continued I, "it is by the labour of your hands we mu&s;t all hope to be &s;upported. Your wages, as a day labourer, will be full &s;ufficient, with proper frugality, to maintain us all, and comfortably too. Thou art now &s;ixteen years old, and ha&s;t &s;trength, and it was given to thee, my &s;on, for very u&s;eful purpo&s;es; for it mu&s;t &s;ave from famine your helple&s;s parents and family. Prepare then this evening to look out for work again&s;t to-morrow, and bring home every night what money you earn, for our &s;upport."</P>
<P>Having thus in&s;tructed him, and &s;ettled the re&s;t, I walked down to the common pri&s;on, where I could enjoy more air and room. But I was not long there when the execrations, lewdne&s;s, and brutality that in|vaded me on every &s;ide, drove me back to my apartment again. Here I &s;at for &s;ome time, pondering upon the &s;trange infatuation of wretches, who finding all man|kind in open arms again&s;t them, were, however labour|ing to make them&s;elves a future and a tremendous ene|my.</P>
<P>Their in&s;en&s;ibility excited my highe&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, and blotted my own unea&s;ine&s;s a while from my mind. It even appeared as a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them. I re&s;olved therefore once more to re|turn, and in &s;pite of their contempt to give them my advice, and conquer them by per&s;everance. Going therefore among them again, I informed Mr. Jen|kin&s;on of my de&s;ign, at which he laughed, but com|municated it to the re&s;t. The propo&s;al was received with the greate&s;t good humour, as it promi&s;ed to afford a new fund of entertainment to per&s;ons who had now no other re&s;ource for mirth, but what could be de|rived from ridicule or debauchery.</P>
<P>I therefore read them a portion of the &s;ervice with a loud unaffected voice, and found my audience per|fectly merry upon the occa&s;ion. Lewd whi&s;pers&punc; groans of contrition burle&s;qued, winking and cough|ing, alternately excited laughter. However, I con|tinued with my natural &s;olemnity to read on, &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|ble that what I did might amend &s;ome, but could it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> receive no contamination from any.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="012405_0135_0F89733CF1D86BF8">After reading, I entered upon my exhortation, which was rather calculated at fir&s;t to amu&s;e them than to re|prove. I previou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that no other motive but their welfare could induce me to this; that I was their fellow pri&s;oner, and now gained nothing by preach|ing. I was &s;orry, I &s;aid, to hear them &s;o very prophane; becau&s;e they got nothing by it, but might lo&s;e a great deal: "For be a&s;&s;ured, my friends," cried I, for you are my friends, however the world may di&s;claim your friend&s;hip, though you &s;wore twelve thou&s;and oaths in a day, it would not put one penny in your pur&s;e. Then what &s;ignifies calling every moment upon the devil, and courting his friend&s;hip, &s;ince you find how &s;curvily he u&s;es you? He has given you nothing here, you find, but a mouthful of oaths and an empty belly; and by the be&s;t accounts I have of him, he will give you nothing that's good hereafter.</P>
<P>"If u&s;ed ill in our dealings with one man, we natur|ally go el&s;ewhere. Were it not worth your while then, ju&s;t to try how you may like the u&s;age of another ma&s;ter, who gives you fair promi&s;es at lea&s;t to come to him? Surely, my friends, of all &s;tupidity in the world, his mu&s;t be greate&s;t, who after robbing an hou&s;e, runs to the thief-takers for protection. And yet how are you more wi&s;e? You are all &s;eeking comfort from him that has already betrayed you, applying to a more malicious being than any thief-taker of them all; for they only decoy, and then hang you but he decoys, and hangs, and, what is wor&s;t of all, will not let you loo&s;e after the hangman has done."</P>
<P>When I had concluded, I received the compliments of my audience, &s;ome of whom came and &s;hook me by the hand, &s;wearing that I was a very hone&s;t fellow, and that they de&s;ired my further acquaintance. I therefore promi&s;ed to repeat my lecture next day, and actually con|ceived &s;ome hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was pa&s;t the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the &s;hafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim. When I had thus &s;atisfied my mind, I went back to my apartment, where my wife had prepared a frugal meal, while Mr. Jenkin&s;on begged leave to add his dinner to
<PB N="138" REF="012405_0136_0F89733DB35ED160">
ours, and partake of the plea&s;ure, as he was kind enough to expre&s;s it, of my conver&s;ation. He had not yet &s;een my family, for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow pa&s;&s;age, already de&s;cribed, by this means they avoided the common pri&s;on. Jenkin&s;on at the fir&s;t interview therefore &s;eemed not a little &s;truck with the beauty of my younge&s;t daughter, which her pen&s;ive air contributed to heighten, and my little ones did not pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>
<P>"Alas, Doctor," cried he, "the&s;e children are too hand&s;ome and too good for &s;uch a place as this!"</P>
<P>"Why, Mr. Jenkin&s;on," replied I, "thank heaven my children are pretty tolerable in morals, and if they be good, it matters little for the re&s;t."</P>
<P>"I fancy, &s;ir, returned my fellow pri&s;oner, "that it mu&s;t give you great comfort to have this little family a|bout you."</P>
<P>A comfort, Mr. Jenkin&s;on," replied I, "yes it is in|deed a comfort, and I would not be without them for all the world; for they can make a dungeon &s;eem a palace. There is but one way in this life of wounding my happine&s;s, and that is by injuring them."</P>
<P>"I am afraid then, &s;ir," cried he, "that I am in &s;ome mea&s;ure culpable; for I think I &s;ee here (looking at my &s;on Mo&s;es) "one that I have injured, and by whom I wi&s;h to be forgiven."</P>
<P>My &s;on immediately recollected his voice and features, though he had before &s;een him in di&s;gui&s;e taking him by the hand, with a &s;mile forgave him. "Yet," continued he, "I can't help wondering at what you could &s;ee in my face, to think me a proper mark for deception."</P>
<P>"My dear &s;ir, returned the other, "it was not your face, but your white &s;tockings and the black ribband in your hair that allured me But no di&s;paragement to your parts, I have deceived wi&s;er men than you in my time, and yet, with all my tricks, the blockheads have been too many for me at la&s;t."</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e," cried my &s;on, "that the narrative of &s;uch a life as yours mu&s;t be extremely in&s;tructive and amu&s;ing."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="012405_0137_0F89733E71AFAA60">"Not much of either," returned Mr. Jenkin&s;on. "Tho&s;e relations which de&s;cribe the tricks and vices only of mankind, by encrea&s;ing our &s;u&s;picion in life, re|tard our &s;ucce&s;s. The traveller that di&s;tru&s;ts every per|&s;on he meets, and turns back upon the appearance of e|very man that looks like a robber, &s;eldom arrives in time to his journey's end.</P>
<P>"Indeed I think from my own experience I may &s;ay, that the knowing one is the &s;illie&s;t fellow under the &s;un. I was thought cunning from my very childhood: when but &s;even years old the ladies would &s;ay that I was a perfect little man; at fourteen I knew the world, cocked my hat, and loved the ladies; at twenty, though I was perfectly hone&s;t, yet every one thought me &s;o cunning, that not one would tru&s;t me. Thus I was at la&s;t obliged to turn &s;harper in my own defence, and have lived ever &s;ince, my head throbbing with &s;chemes to deceive, and my heart palpitating with fears of detection.</P>
<P>"I u&s;ed often to laugh at your hone&s;t &s;imple neigh|bour Flamborough, and one way or another generally cheated him once a year. Yet &s;till the hone&s;t man went forward without &s;u&s;picion, and grew rich, while I &s;till continued trick&s;y and cunning, and was poor, without the con&s;olation of being hone&s;t.</P>
<P>"However," continued he, "let me know your ca&s;e&punc; and what has brought you here; perhaps though I have not &s;kill to avoid a goal my&s;elf, I may extricate my friends."</P>
<P>In compliance with his curio&s;ity, I informed him of the whole train of accidents and follies that had plunged me into my pre&s;ent troubles, and my utter inability to get free.</P>
<P>After hearing my &s;tory, and pau&s;ing &s;ome minutes, he &s;lapt his forehead, as if he had hit upon &s;omething mate|rial, and took his leave, &s;aying he would try what could be done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The &s;ame Subject continued.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning I communicated to my wife and children the &s;cheme I had planned of reforming the pri&s;oners, which they received with univer&s;al di&s;ap|probation, alledging the impo&s;&s;ibility and impropriety of it; adding, that my endeavours would no way contri|bute to their amendment, but might probably di&s;grace my calling.</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me," returned I,
<Q>the&s;e people, however fallen, are &s;till men, and that is a very good title to my affections. Good council rejected, returns to en|rich the giver's bo&s;om; and though the in&s;truction I communicate may not mend them, yet it will a&s;&s;ured|ly mend my&s;elf. If the&s;e wretches, my children, were princes, there would be thou&s;ands ready to of|fer their mini&s;try; but, in my opinion, the heart that is buried in a dungeon is as precious as that &s;eated up|on a throne. Yes, my trea&s;ures, if I can mend them I will; perhaps they will not all de&s;pi&s;e me. Per|haps I may catch up even one from the gulph, and that will be great gain; for is there upon earth a gem &s;o precious as the human &s;oul?</Q></P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, I left them, and de&s;cended to the com|mon pri&s;on, where I found the pri&s;oners very merry, expecting my arrival: and each prepared with &s;ome goal trick to play upon the doctor. Thus, as I was going to begin, one turned my wig awry, as if by ac|cident, and then a&s;ked my pardon. A &s;econd, who &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance, had a knack of &s;pitting through his teeth, which fell in &s;howers upon my book. A
<PB N="141" REF="012405_0139_0F89733FF2CDC490">
third would cry amen in &s;uch an affected tone, as gave the re&s;t great delight. A fourth hath &s;lily picked my pocket of my &s;pectacles. But there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he who&s;e trick gave more univer&s;al plea&s;ure than all the re&s;t; for ob&s;erving the manner in which I had di&s;po&s;ed my books on the table before me, he very dexterou&s;ly di&s;|placed one of them, and put an ob&s;cene je&s;t-book of his own in the place. However I took no notice of all that this mi&s;chievous groupe of little beings could do; but went on, perfectly &s;en&s;ible that what was ridiculous in my attempt, would excite mirth only the fir&s;t or &s;e|cond time, while what was &s;erious would be permanent. My de&s;ign &s;ucceeded, and in le&s;s than &s;ix days &s;ome were penitent, and all attentive.</P>
<P>It was now that I applauded my per&s;everance and addre&s;s, at thus giving &s;en&s;ibility to wretches dive&s;ted of every moral feeling, and now began to think of doing them temporal &s;ervices al&s;o, by rendering their &s;ituation &s;omewhat more comfortable. Their time had hitherto been divided between famine and exce&s;s, tumultuous riot and bitter repining. Their only employment was quarrelling among each other, playing cribbage, and cutting tobacco &s;toppers. From this la&s;t mode of idle indu&s;try I took the hint of &s;etting &s;uch as cho&s;e to work at cutting pegs for tobacconi&s;ts and &s;hoemakers, the pro|per wood being bought by a general &s;ub&s;cription, and when manufactured, &s;old by my appointment; &s;o that each earned &s;omething every day: a trifle indeed, but &s;ufficient to maintain him.</P>
<P>I did not &s;top here, but in&s;tituted fines for the puni&s;h|ment of immorality, and rewards for peculiar indu&s;try. Thus in le&s;s than a fortnight I had formed them into &s;omething &s;ocial and humane, and had the plea&s;ure of regarding my&s;elf as a legi&s;lator, who had brought men from their native ferocity into friend&s;hip and obedi|ence.</P>
<P>And it were highly to be wi&s;hed, that legi&s;lative power would thus direct the law rather to reformation than &s;everity. That it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making puni&s;h|ments familiar, but formidable. In&s;tead of our pre&s;ent,
<PB N="142" REF="012405_0140_0F897340B37274B8">
pri&s;ons, which find or make men guilty, which enclo&s;e wretches for the commi&s;&s;ion of one crime, and return them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpetration of thou&s;ands; it were to be wi&s;hed we had as in other parts of Europe, places of penitence and &s;olitude, where the accu&s;ed might be attended by &s;uch as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives to virtue if inno|cent. And this, but not the increa&s;ing puni&s;hments, is the way to mend a &s;tate: nor can I avoid even que&s;|tioning the validity of that right which &s;ocial combi|nations have a&s;&s;umed of capitally puni&s;hing offences of a &s;light nature. In ca&s;es of murder their right is obvi|ous, as it is the duty of us all, from the law of &s;elf-de|fence, to cut off that man who has &s;hewn a di&s;regard for the life of another. Again&s;t &s;uch, all nature ri&s;es in arms; but it is not &s;o again&s;t him who &s;teals my pro|perty. Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the hor&s;e he &s;teals is as much his property as mine. If then I have any right, it mu&s;t be from a compact made between us, that he who deprives the other of his hor&s;e, &s;hall die. But this is a fal&s;e compact; be|cau&s;e no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away, as it is not his own. And next the compact is inadequate, and would be &s;et a&s;ide even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience, &s;ince it is far better that two men &s;hould live, than that one man &s;hould ride.&mdash; But a compact that is fal&s;e between two men, is equally &s;o between an hundred, or an hundred thou&s;and; for as ten millions of circles can never make a &s;quare, &s;o the united voice of myriads cannot lend the &s;malle&s;t founda|tion to fal&s;ehood. It is thus that rea&s;on &s;peaks, and un|tutored nature &s;ays the &s;ame thing. Savages that are di|rected nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other; they &s;eldom &s;hed blood but to reta|liate former cruelty.</P>
<P>Our Saxon ance&s;tors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commencing governments that have the print of na|ture &s;till &s;trong upon them, &s;carce any crime is held capital.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="012405_0141_0F8973417358F560">It is among the citizens of a refined community that pe|nal laws, which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, &s;eems to acquire the moro&s;ene&s;s of age; and as if our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were become dearer in proportion as they en|crea&s;ed, as if the more enormous our wealth, the more exten&s;ive our fears, our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are paled up with new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to &s;care every invader.</P>
<P>Whether it is from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of our people, that this country &s;hould &s;hew more convicts in a year, than half the dominions of Europe united? Perhaps it is owing to both; for they mutually produce each other. When by indi&s;criminate penal laws a nation beholds the &s;ame puni&s;hment affixed to di&s;&s;imilar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no di&s;tinc|tion in the penalty, the people are led to lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of di&s;tinction in the crime, and this di&s;tinction is the bul|wark of all morality: thus the multitude of laws pro|duce new vices, and new vices call for fre&s;h re&s;traints.</P>

<P>I HAD now been confined more than a fornight, but had not &s;ince my arrival been vi&s;ited by my dear Olivia, and I greatly longed to &s;ee her. Having com|municated my wi&s;hes to my wife, the next morning the poor girl entered my apartment, leaning on her &s;i&s;ter's arm. The change which I &s;aw in her countenance &s;truck me. The numberle&s;s graces that once re&s;ided there were now fled, and the hand of death &s;eemed to have moulded every feature to alarm me. Her temples were &s;unk, her forehead was ten&s;e, and a fatal palene&s;s &s;at up|on her cheek.</P>
<P>"I am glad to &s;ee thee, my dear," cried I; "but why this dejection, Livy? I hope my love, you have too great a regard for me, to permit di&s;appointment thus to undermine a life which I prize as my own. Be chearful, child, and we may yet &s;ee happier days."</P>
<P>"You have ever, &s;ir," replied &s;he, "been kind to me, and it adds to my pain that I &s;hall never have an oppor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unity of &s;haring that happine&s;s you promi&s;e. Happine&s;s, I fear, is no longer re&s;erved for me here; and I long to be rid of a place where I have only found di&s;tre&s;s. Indeed, Sir, I wi&s;h you would make a proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Mr. Thornhill; it may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, induce him to pity you, and it will give me relief in dying."</P>
<P>"Never, child," replied I, "I never &s;hall be brought to acknowledge my daughter a pro&s;titute; for tho' the world may look upon your offence with &s;corn, let it be mine to regard it as a mark of credulity, not of guilt. My dear, I am no way mi&s;erable in this place, however di&s;mal it may &s;eem and be a&s;&s;ured that while

<P>After the departure of my daughter, my fellow pri|&s;oner, who was by at this interview, &s;en&s;ibly enough ex|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ulated upon my ob&s;tinacy, in refu&s;ing a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which promi&s;ed to give me freedom. He ob&s;erved, that the re&s;t of my family was not to be &s;acrificed to the peace of one child alone, and &s;he the only one who had offended me. "Be&s;ide," added he, "I don't know if it be ju&s;t thus to ob&s;truct the union of man and wife, which you do at pre&s;ent, by refu&s;ing to con&s;ent to a match which you cannot hinder, but may render un|happy."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied I, "you are unacquainted with the man that oppr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;es us. I am very &s;en&s;ible that no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion I can make could procure me liberty even for an hour. I am told that even in this very room a debtor of his, no later than la&s;t year, died for want. But though my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and approbation could tran&s;|fer me from hence, to the mo&s;t beautiful apartment he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, yet I would grant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; as &s;omething whi&s;pers me that it would be giving a &s;anction to adul|tery. While my daughter lives, no other marriage of of his &s;hall ever be legal in my eye. Were &s;he removed, indeed, I &s;hould be the ba&s;e&s;t of men, from any re&s;ent|ment of my own, to attempt putting a&s;under tho&s;e who wi&s;h for an union. No, villain as he is, I could then wi&s;h him married, to prevent the con&s;equences of his future debaucheries. But &s;hould I not now be the mo&s;t cruel of all fathers, to &s;ign an in&s;trument which mu&s;t &s;end my child to the grave, merely to avoid a pri&s;on my&s;elf; and thus to e&s;cape one pang, break my child's heart with a thou&s;and?</P>
<P>He acquie&s;ced in the ju&s;tice of this an&s;wer, but could not avoid ob&s;erving, that he feared my daughter's life was already too much wa&s;ted to keep me long a pri&s;oner. "However, continued he, though you refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the nephew, I hope you have no objections to lay|ing your ca&s;e before the uncle, who has the fir&s;t cha|racter in the kingdom for every thing that is ju&s;t and good. I would advi&s;e you to &s;end him a letter by the
<PB N="146" REF="012405_0144_0F897343B415D108">
po&s;t intimating all his nephew's ill u&s;age, and my life for it that in three days you &s;hall have an an&s;wer." I thank'd him for the hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and in&s;tantly &s;et about com|plying; but I wanted paper, and unluckily all our money had been laid out that morning in provi&s;ions, however he &s;upplied me.</P>
<P>For the three en&s;uing days I was in a &s;tate of anxiety, to know what reception my letter might meet with; but in the mean time was frequently &s;olicited by my wife to &s;ubmit to any conditions rather than remain here, and every hour received repeated accounts of the decline of my daughter's health. The third day and the fourth arrived, but I received no an&s;wer to my letter: the com|plaints of a &s;tranger again&s;t a favourite nephew, were no way likely to &s;ucceed; &s;o that the&s;e hopes &s;oon va|ni&s;hed like all my former. My mind, however, &s;till &s;up|ported it&s;elf though confinement and bad air began to make a vi&s;ible alteration in my health, and my arm that had &s;uffered in the fire, grew wor&s;e. But my children &s;till &s;at by me, and while I was &s;tretched on my &s;traw, read to me by turns, or li&s;tned and wept at my in&s;ruc|tions. But my daughter's health declined fa&s;ter than mine; every me&s;&s;age from her contributed to encrea&s;e my apprehen&s;ions and pain. The fifth morning after I had written the letter which was &s;ent to Sir William Thornhill, I was alarmed with an account that &s;he was &s;peechle&s;s. Now it was that confinement was truly painful to me: my &s;oul was bur&s;ting from its pri&s;on to be near the pillow of my child, to comfort, to &s;trengthen her, to receive her la&s;t wi&s;hes, and teach her &s;oul the way to heaven! Another account came. She was ex|piring, and yet I was debarred the &s;mall comfort of weeping by her. My fellow pri&s;oner, &s;ome time after, came with the la&s;t account. He bade me be patient. She was dead!&mdash;The next morning he returned, and found me with my two little ones, now my only compa|nions, who were u&s;ing all their innocent efforts to com|fort me. They entreated to read to me, and bid me not to cry, for I was now too old to weep. "And is not my &s;i&s;ter an angel, now, papa," cried the elde&s;t, "and why then are you &s;orry for her? I wi&s;h I were an angel out of this frightful place, if my papa were with me." Yes," added my younge&s;t darling, "Heaven where my &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="147" REF="012405_0145_0F8973449889D470">
is, is a finer place than this, and there are none but good people there, and the people here are very bad."</P>
<P>Mr. Jenkin&s;on interrupted their harmle&s;s prattle, by ob&s;erving that now my daughter was no more I &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly think of the re&s;t of my family, and at|tempt to &s;ave my own life, which was every day declin|ing for want of nece&s;&s;aries and whol&s;ome air. He added, that it was now incumbent on me to &s;acrifice any pride or re&s;entment of my own, to the welfare of tho&s;e who depended on me for &s;upport; and that I was now, both by rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, obliged to try to reconcile my landlord.</P>
<P>"Heaven be prai&s;ed," replied I, "there is no pride left me now, I &s;hould dete&s;t my own heart if I &s;aw either pride, or re&s;entment lurking there. On the contrary, as my oppre&s;&s;or has been once my pari&s;hioner, I hope one day to pre&s;ent him up an unpolluted &s;oul at the eternal tribunal. No, &s;ir, I have no re&s;entment now, and though he has taken from me what I held dearer than all his trea&s;ures, though he has wrung my heart, for I am &s;ick almo&s;t to fainting, very &s;ick, my fellow pri&s;oner, yet that &s;hall never in&s;pire me with vengeance. I am now willing to approve his marriage, and if this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion can do him any plea&s;ure, let him know, that if I have done him any injury, I am &s;orry for it." Mr. Jenkin&s;on took pen and ink, and wrote down my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion nearly as I have expre&s;t it, to which I &s;igned my name. My &s;on was employed to carry the letter to Mr. Thornhill, who was then at his &s;eat in the country. He went, and in about &s;ix hours returned with a verbal an&s;wer. He had &s;ome difficulty, he &s;aid, to get a &s;ight of his landlord, as the &s;ervants were in&s;olent and &s;u&s;|picious; but he accidently &s;aw him as he was going out upon bu&s;ine&s;s, preparing for his marriage, which was to be in three days. He continued to inform us, that he &s;tept up in the humble&s;t manner, and delivered the letter, which, when Mr. Thornhill had read, he &s;aid that all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was now too late and unnece&s;&s;ary; that he had heard of our application to his uncle, which met with the contempt it de&s;erved; and as for the re&s;t, that all future applications &s;hould be directed to his attorney, not to him. He ob&s;erved, however, that as he
<PB N="148" REF="012405_0146_0F89734620E96A40">
had a very good opinion of the di&s;cretion of the two young ladies, they might have been the mo&s;t agreeable interce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>"Well, &s;ir," &s;aid I to my fellow pri&s;oner, "you now di&s;cover the temper of the man that oppre&s;&s;es me. He can at once be facetious and cruel; but let him u&s;e me as he will, I &s;hall &s;oon be free, in &s;pite of all his bolts to re&s;train me. I am now drawing to|wards an abode that looks brighter as I approach it: this expectation cheers my afflictions; and though I &s;hall leave an helple&s;s family of orphans behind me, yet they will not be utterly for&s;aken; &s;ome friend, perhaps, will be found to a&s;&s;i&s;t them for the &s;ake of their poor father, and &s;ome may charitably relieve them for the &s;ake of their heavenly father."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I &s;poke, my wife, whom I had not &s;een that day before, appeared with looks of terror, and making efforts, but unable to &s;peak. "Why, my love," cried I, "why will you thus encrea&s;e my affliction by your own; what though no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions can turn our &s;evere ma&s;ter, though he has doomed me to die in this place of wretchedne&s;s, and though we have lo&s;t a darling child, yet &s;till you will find comfort in your other children when I &s;hall be no more." "We have indeed lo&s;t," returned &s;he, "a darling child. My Sophia, my deare&s;t, is gone, &s;natched from us, carried off by ruffians."</P>
<P>"How, madam," cried my fellow pri&s;oner, " Mi&s;s Sophia carried off by villains, &s;ure it cannot be?"</P>
<P>She could only an&s;wer with a fixed look and a flood of tears. But one of the pri&s;oners wives, who was pre&s;ent, and came in with her, gave us a more di&s;tinct account: &s;he informed us that as my wife, my daughter, and her|&s;elf, were taking a walk together on the great road a lit|tle way out of the village, a po&s;t-chai&s;e and four drove up to them and in&s;tantly &s;topt. Upon which, a well-dre&s;t man, but not Mr. Thornhill, &s;tepping out, cla&s;ped my daughter round the wai&s;t, and forcing her in, bid the po&s;tillion drive on, &s;o that they were out of &s;ight in a moment.</P>
<P>"Now," cried I, "the &s;um of my mi&s;eries is made up, nor is it in the power of any thing on earth to
<PB N="149" REF="012405_0147_0F89734709556398">
give me another pang. What! not one left! not to leave me one! the mon&s;ter! the child that was next my heart! &s;he had the beauty of an angel, and almo&s;t the wi&s;dom of an angel. But &s;upport that woman, nor let her fall. Not to leave me one!"&mdash;"Alas! my hu&s;hand," &s;aid my wife, "you &s;eem to want comfort even more than I. Our di&s;tre&s;&s;es are great; but I could bear this and more, if I &s;aw you but ea&s;y. They may take away my children and all the world, if they leave me but you."</P>
<P>My &s;on, who was pre&s;ent, endeavoured to moderate our grief; he bade us take comfort, for he hoped that we might &s;till have rea&s;on to be thankful&mdash;"My child," cried I, "look round the world, and &s;ee if there be any happine&s;s left me now. Is not every ray of comfort &s;hut out; while all our bright pro&s;pects only lie be|yond the grave!"&mdash;"My dear father," returned he, "I hope there is &s;till &s;omething that will give you an interval of &s;atisfaction; for I have a letter from my brother George,"&mdash;"What of him, child," interrupted I, does he know of our mi&s;ery. I hope my boy is exempt from any part of what his wretched family &s;uffers?"&mdash; Yes, &s;ir," returned he, "he is perfectly gay, chear|ful, and happy. His letter brings nothing but good news; he is the favourite of his colonel, who promi&s;es to procure him the very next lieutenancy that becomes vacant!"</P>
<P>"And are you &s;ure of all this," cried my wife, "are you &s;ure that nothing ill has befallen my boy?"&mdash; Nothing indeed, madam," returned my &s;on, "you &s;hall &s;ee the letter, which will give you the highe&s;t plea&s;ure; and if any thing can procure you comfort I am &s;ure that will." "But are you &s;ure," &s;till re|peated &s;he, "that the letter is from him&s;elf, and that he is really &s;o happy?"&mdash;"Yes, madam," replied he, it is certainly his, and he will one day be the credit and the &s;upport of our family!"&mdash;"Then I thank providence," cried &s;he, "that my la&s;t letter to him has mi&s;carried. Yes, my dear," continued &s;he, turn|ing to me, "I will now confe&s;s that though the hand of heaven is &s;ore upon us in other in&s;tances, it has been favourable here. By the la&s;t letter I wrote my &s;on,
<PB N="150" REF="012405_0148_0F8973477480B450">
which was in the bitterne&s;s of anger, I de&s;ired him, upon his mother's ble&s;&s;ing, and if he had the heart of a man, to &s;ee ju&s;tice done his father and &s;i&s;ter, and avenge our cau&s;e. But thanks be to him that directs all things, it has mi&s;carried and I am at re&s;t."&mdash; "Woman," cried I, "thou ha&s;t done very ill, and at another time my reproaches might have been more &s;evere. Oh! what a tremendous gulph ha&s;t thou e&s;caped, that would have buried both thee and him in endle&s;s ruin. Providence, indeed, has here been kinder to us than we to our&s;elves. It has re&s;erved that &s;on to be the father and protector of my children when I &s;hall be away. How unju&s;tly did I complain of being &s;tript of every comfort, when I &s;till hear that he is happy and in&s;en&s;ible of our afflictions; &s;till kept in re&s;erve to &s;upport his widowed mother, to protect his brothers and &s;i&s;ters. But what &s;i&s;ters has he left, he has no &s;i&s;ters now, they are all gone, robbed from me, and I am undone."&mdash; "Father," interrupted my &s;on, "I beg you will give me leave to read his letter, I know it will plea&s;e you." Upon which, with my permi&s;&s;ion, he read as follows:</P>

<P>"In all our mi&s;eries," cried I, "what thanks have we not to return, that one at lea&s;t of our family is exempt|ed from what we &s;uffer. Heaven be his guard, and keep my boy thus happy to be the &s;upporter of his wi|dowed mother, and the father of the&s;e two babes, which are all the patrimony I can now bequeath him.

I had &s;carce &s;aid the&s;e words, when a noi&s;e, like that of a tu|mult, &s;eemed to proceed from the pri&s;on below; it died away &s;oon after, and a clanking of &s;etters was heard along the pa&s;&s;age that led to my apartment. The keeper of the pri&s;on entered, holding a man all bloody, wounded and fettered with the heavie&s;t irons. I looked with compa&s;&s;ion on the wretch as he approached me, but with horror when I found it was my own &s;on.&mdash; "My George! My George! and do I behold thee thus? Wounded! Fettered! Is this thy happine&s;s! Is this the manner you return to me! O that this &s;ight could break my heart at once and let me die!"</P>
<P>"Where, Sir, is your fortitude," returned my &s;on with an intrepid voice. "I mu&s;t &s;uffer, my life is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|feited, and let them take it; it is my la&s;t happine&s;s that I have committed no murder, tho' I have lo&s;t all hopes of pardon."</P>
<P>I tried to re&s;train my pa&s;&s;ions for a few minutes in &s;ilence, but I thought I &s;hould have died with the effort. &mdash;"O my boy, my heart weeps to behold thee thus,
<PB N="152" REF="012405_0150_0F897349B2B097D0">
and I cannot, cannot help it. In the moment that I thought thee ble&s;t, and prayed for thy &s;afety, to behold thee thus again! Chained, wounded. And yet the death of the youthful is happy. But I am old, a very old man, and have lived to &s;ee this day. To &s;ee my chil|dren all untimely falling about me, while I continue a wretched &s;urvivor in the mid&s;t of ruin! May all the cur&s;es that ever &s;unk a &s;oul fall heavy upon the murderer of my children. May he live, like me, to &s;ee&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hold, Sir," replied my &s;on, "or I &s;hall blu&s;h for thee. How, Sir, forgetful of your age, your holy calling, thus to arrogate the ju&s;tice of heaven, and fling tho&s;e cur&s;es upward that mu&s;t &s;oon de&s;cend to cru&s;h thy own grey head with de&s;truction! No, Sir, let it be your care now to fit me for that vile death I mu&s;t &s;hortly &s;uffer, to arm me with hope and re&s;olution, to give me courage to drink of that bitterne&s;s which mu&s;t &s;hortly be my por|tion"</P>
<P>"My child, you mu&s;t not die: I am &s;ure no offence of thine can de&s;erve &s;o vile a puni&s;hment. My George could never be guilty of any crime to make his ance&s;tors a&s;hamed of him."</P>
<P>"Mine, Sir," returned my &s;on, "is, I fear, and un|pardonable one. I have &s;ent a challenge, and that is death by a late-act of parliament. When I received my mother's letter from home, I immediately came down, determined to puni&s;h the betrayer of our honour and &s;ent him an order to meet me, which he an&s;wered, not in per&s;on, but by his di&s;patching four of his dome&s;tics to &s;eize me. I wounded one, but the re&s;t made me their pri&s;o|ner. The coward is determined to put the law in execu|tion again&s;t me, the proofs are undeniable; and as I am the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;or upon the &s;tatute, I &s;ee no hopes of pardon. But you have often charmed me with the le&s;|&s;ons of fortitude, let me now, Sir, find them in your example,"</P>
<P>"And, my &s;on, you &s;hall find them. I am now rai&s;ed above this world, and all the plea&s;ures it can produce. From this moment I break from my heart all the ties that held it down to earth, and will prepare to fit us both for eternity. Yes, my &s;on, I will point out the way, and my &s;oul &s;hall guide yours in the a&s;cent, for
<PB N="153" REF="012405_0151_0F89734A71D9DB28">
we will take our flight together. I now &s;ee and am convinced you can expect no pardon here, and I can only exhort you to &s;eek it at that greate&s;t tribunal where we both &s;hall &s;hortly an&s;wer. But let us not be niggardly in our exhortation, but let all our fellow pri&s;oners have a &s;hare: good gaoler, let them be permitted to &s;tand here, while I attempt to improve them." Thus &s;aying, I made an effort to ri&s;e from my &s;traw, but wanted &s;trength, and was able only to recline again&s;t the wall. The pri&s;oners a&s;&s;embled according to my directions, for they loved to hear my council, my &s;on and his mother &s;upported me on either &s;ide, I looked and &s;aw that none were wanting, and then addre&s;&s;ed them with the following exhortation.</P>

<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. The equal dealings of providence demon&s;trated with re|gard to the happy and the mi&s;erable here below. That from the nature of plea&s;ure and pain, the wretched mu&s;t be repaid the balance of their &s;ufferings in the life hereafter.</HEAD>
<P>MY friends, my children, and fellow-&s;ufferers, when I reflect on the di&s;tribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to enjoy, yet &s;till more to &s;uffer. Though we &s;hould examine the whole world, we &s;hall not find one man &s;o happy as to have nothing left to wi&s;h for; but we daily &s;ee thou&s;ands who by &s;uicide &s;hew us they have nothing left to hope. In this life then it appears that we cannot be entirely ble&s;t, but yet we may be completely mi&s;erable!</P>
<P>Why man &s;hould thus feel pain, why our wretchedne&s;s &s;hould be requi&s;ite in the formation of univer&s;al felicity, why, when all other &s;y&s;tems are made perfect only by the perfection of their &s;ubordinate parts, the great &s;y&s;|tem &s;hould require for its perfection, parts that are not only &s;ubordinate to others, but imperfect in them&s;elves?
<PB N="154" REF="012405_0152_0F89734B33841470">
The&s;e are que&s;tions that never can be explained, and might be u&s;ele&s;s if known. On this &s;ubject providence has thought fit to elude our curio&s;ity, &s;atisfied with granting us motives to con&s;olation</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, man has called in the friendly a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of philo&s;ophy, and heaven &s;eeing the incapacity of that to con&s;ole him, has given him the aid of religion. The con&s;olations of philo&s;ophy are very amu&s;ing, but often fallacious. It tells us that life is filled with com|forts, if we will but enjoy them; and on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have mi&s;eries here, life is &s;hort, and they will &s;oon be over. Thus do the&s;e con|&s;olations de&s;troy each other; for if life is a place of com|fort, its &s;hortne&s;s mu&s;t be mi&s;ery, and if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philo&s;ophy is weak; but religion comforts in an higher &s;train. Man is here, it tells us, &s;itting up his mind, and preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making him|&s;elf a heaven of happine&s;s here, while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices &s;hrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has antici|pated the vengeance of heaven. To religion then we mu&s;t hold in every circum&s;tance of life for our true&s;t comfort; for if already we are happy, it is a plea&s;ure to think that we can make that happine&s;s unending, and if we are mi&s;erable, it is very con&s;oling to think that there is a place of re&s;t. Thus to the fortunate religion holds out a continuance of bli&s;s, to the wretched a change from pain.</P>
<P>But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promi&s;ed peculiar reward to the unhappy; the &s;ick, the naked, the hou&s;ele&s;s, the heavy-laden, and the pri&s;oner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have ever mo&s;t frequent promi&s;es in our &s;acred law. The author of our religion every where profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf the wretch's friend, and unlike the fal&s;e ones of this world be&s;tows all his care&s;&s;es upon the forlorn. The unthink|ing have cen&s;ured this as partiality, as a preference with out merit to de&s;erve it. But they never reflect that it is not in the power even of heaven it&s;elf to make the offer of uncea&s;ing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the mi&s;erable. To the fir&s;t eternity is but a &s;ingle ble&s;&s;ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="155" REF="012405_0153_0F89734BF10A69B0">
&s;ince at mo&s;t it but encrea&s;es what they already po&s;&s;e&s;s. To the latter it is a double advantage; for it dimi|ni&s;hes their pain here, and rewards them with heavenly bli&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>But providence is in another re&s;pect kinder to the poor than the rich; for as it thus makes the life after death more de&s;irable, &s;o it &s;mooths the pa&s;&s;age there. The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man of &s;orrows lays him&s;elf quietly down, he has no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to regret, and but few ties to &s;top his de|parture: he feels only nature's pang in the final &s;epara|tion, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the con&s;titution, nature kindly covers with in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Thus providence has given the wretched two advan|tages over the happy in this life, greater felicity in dy|ing, and in heaven all that &s;uperiority of plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from contra&s;ted enjoyment. And this &s;uperiority, my friends, is no &s;mall advantage, and &s;eems to be one of the plea&s;ures of the poor man in the parable; for though he was already in heaven; and felt all the rap|tures it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happine&s;s, that he had once been wretched and now was comforted, that he had known what it was to be mi&s;erable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, my friends, you &s;ee religion does what philo&s;o|phy could never do: it &s;hews the equal dealings of heaven to the happy and to the unhappy, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the &s;ame &s;tandard. It gives to both rich and poor the &s;ame happine&s;s hereafter, and equal hopes to a&s;pire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying plea&s;ure here, the poor have the endle&s;s &s;atisfaction of knowing what it was once to be mi&s;erable, when crowned with endle&s;s felicity hereafter; and even though this &s;hould be called a &s;mall advantage, yet being an eternal one, it mu&s;t make up by duration what the temporal happine&s;s of the great may have ex|ceeded by inten&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e are therefore the con&s;olations which the wretch|ed have peculiar to them&s;elves, and in which they are above the re&s;t of mankind; in other re&s;pects they are
<PB N="156" REF="012405_0154_0F89734D777E7B60">
below them. They who would know the mi&s;eries of the poor mu&s;t &s;ee life and endure it. To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none either believe or practi&s;e. The men who have the nece&s;&s;aries of living are not poor, and they who want them mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. Yes, my friends we mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can &s;ooth the wants of nature, can give ela&s;tic &s;weetne&s;s to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ea&s;e to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the philo&s;opher from his couch of &s;oftne&s;s tell us that we can re&s;i&s;t all the&s;e. Alas! the effort by which we re&s;i&s;t them is &s;till the greate&s;t pain! Death is &s;light, and any man &s;u&s;tains it; but tor|ments are dreadful, and the&s;e no man can endure.</P>
<P>To us then, my friends, the promi&s;es of happine&s;s in heaven &s;hould be peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are then indeed of all men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. When I look round the&s;e gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us: this light that only &s;erves to &s;hew the horrors of the place, tho&s;e &s;hackles that tyranny has impo&s;ed, or crime made nece&s;&s;ary: when I &s;urvey the&s;e emaciated looks, and hear tho&s;e groans, O my friends, what a glorious exchange would heaven be for the&s;e. To fly through regions unconfin|ed as air, to ba&s;k in the &s;un&s;hine of eternal bli&s;s, to carol over endle&s;s hymns of prai&s;e, to have no ma&s;ter to threaten or in&s;ult us, but the form of goodne&s;s him&s;elf for ever in our eyes, when I think of the&s;e things, death becomes the me&s;&s;enger of very glad tidings; when I think of the&s;e things, his &s;harpe&s;t arrow becomes the &s;taff of my &s;up|port; when I think of the&s;e things, what is there in life worth having? When I think of the&s;e things, what is there that &s;hould not be &s;purned away? Kings in their palaces &s;hould groan for &s;uch advantages; but we, hum|bled as we are, &s;hould yearn for them.</P>
<P>And &s;hall the&s;e things be ours? Ours they will cer|tainly be, if we but try for them; and what is a comfort, we are &s;hut out from many temptations that would retard our pur&s;uit. Only let us try for them: and they will certainly be ours, and what is &s;till a comfort, &s;hortly too; for if we look back on pa&s;t life, it appears but a very &s;hort &s;pan, and whatever we may think of the re&s;t
<PB N="157" REF="012405_0155_0F89734E706E6830">
of life, it will yet be found of le&s;s duration; as we grow older the days &s;eem to grow &s;horter, and our intimacy with time ever le&s;&s;ens the perception of his &s;tay. Then let us take comfort now, for we &s;hall &s;oon be at our journey's end; we &s;hall &s;oon lay down the heavy burthen laid by heaven upon us, and though death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and like his horizon, &s;till flies before him; yet the time will certainly and &s;hortly come, when we &s;hall cea&s;e from our toil; when the luxurious great ones of the world &s;hall no more tread us to the earth; when we &s;hall think with plea&s;ure on our &s;uffer|ings below; when we &s;hall be &s;urrounded with all our friends, or &s;uch as de&s;erved our friend&s;hip; when our bli&s;s &s;hall be unutterable, and &s;till, to crown all, unending.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Happier pro&s;pects begin to appear. Let us be inflexible, and fortune will at la&s;t change in our favour.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I had thus fini&s;hed and my audience was retired, the gaoler, who was one of the mo&s;t humane of his profe&s;&s;ion, hoped I would not be di&s;plea&s;ed, as what he did was but his duty, ob&s;erving that he mu&s;t be obliged to remove my &s;on into a &s;tronger cell, but that he &s;hould be permitted to revi&s;it me every morning. I thanked him for his clemency, and gra&s;ping my boy's hand, bade him farewell, and be mindful of the great duty that was before him.</P>
<P>I again therefore laid me down, and one of my little ones &s;at by my bed&s;ide reading, when Mr. Jenkin&s;on entering, informed me that there was news of my daugh|ter; for that &s;he was &s;een by a per&s;on about two hours before in a &s;trange gentleman's company, and that they had &s;topt at a neighbouring village for refre&s;hment, and &s;eemed as if returning to town. He had &s;carce delivered this news, when the gaoler came with looks of ha&s;te and plea&s;ure, to inform me, that my daughter was found.
<PB N="158" REF="012405_0156_0F89734EF19FD798">
Mo&s;es came running in a moment after, crying out that his &s;i&s;ter Sophy was below, and coming up with our old friend Mr. Burchell.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he delivered this news my deare&s;t girl entered, and with looks almo&s;t wild with plea&s;ure, ran to ki&s;s me in a tran&s;port of affection. Her mother's tears and &s;ilence al&s;o &s;hewed her plea&s;ure&mdash;"Here, papa," cried the charming girl, "here is the brave man to whom I owe "my delivery; to this gentleman's intrepidity I am in|debted for my happine&s;s and &s;afety.&mdash;" A ki&s;s from Mr. Burchell, who&s;e plea&s;ure &s;eemed even greater than hers, interrupted what &s;he was going to add.</P>
<P>"Ah, Mr. Burchell," cried I, "this is but a wretch|ed habitation you now find us in; and we are now very different from what you la&s;t &s;aw us. You were ever our friend: we have long di&s;covered our errors with regard to you, and repented of our ingratitude. After the vile u&s;age you then received at my hands, I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to behold your face; yet I hope you'll forgive me, as I was deceived by a ba&s;e ungene|rous wretch, who, under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip has undone me."</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible," replied Mr. Burchell, "that I &s;hould forgive you, as you never de&s;erved my re&s;entment. I partly &s;aw your delu&s;ion then, and as it was out of my power to re&s;train, I could only pity it!"</P>
<P>"It was ever my conjecture," cried I, "that your mind was noble; but now I find it &s;o. But tell me, my dear child, how ha&s;t thou been relieved, or who the ruffians were who carried thee away?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir," replied &s;he, "as to the villain who brought me off, I am yet ignorant. For as my mam|ma and I were walking out, he came behind us, and almo&s;t before I could call for help, forced me into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and in an in&s;tant the hor&s;es drove away. I met &s;everal on the road, to whom I cried out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but they di&s;regarded my entreaties. In the mean time the ruffian him&s;elf u&s;ed every art to hinder me from crying out: he flattered and threatened by turns, and &s;wore that if I continued but &s;ilent, he in|tended no harm. In the mean time I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up, and whom &s;hould I per|ceive

at &s;ome di&s;tance but your old friend Mr. Burchell, walking along with his u&s;ual &s;wiftne&s;s, with the great &s;tick for which we u&s;ed &s;o much to ridicule him. As &s;oon as we came within hearing, I called out to him by name, and entreated his help. I repeated my ex|clamations &s;everal times, upon which, with a very loud voice, he bid the po&s;tilion &s;top; but the boy took no notice, but drove on with &s;till greater &s;peed. I now thought he could never overtake us, when in le&s;s than a minute I &s;aw Mr. Burchell come running up by the &s;ide of the hor&s;es, and with one blow knock the po&s;tilion to the ground. The hor&s;es when he was fallen &s;oon &s;topt of them&s;elves, and the ruffian &s;tepping out, with oaths and menaces drew his &s;word, and order|ed him at his peril to retire; but Mr. Burchell run|ning up, &s;hivered his &s;word to pieces, and then pur|&s;ued him for near a quarter of a mile; but he made his e&s;cape. I was at this time come out my&s;elf, willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t my deliverer; but he &s;oon returned to me in tri|umph. The po&s;tilion, who was recovered, was going to make his e&s;cape too; but Mr. Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again, and drive back to town. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t, he reluctantly complied, though the wound he had received &s;eemed, to me at lea&s;t, to be dangerous. He continued to complain of the pain as we drove along, &s;o that he at la&s;t excited Mr. Burchell's compa&s;&s;ion, who, at my reque&s;t, exchang|ed him for another at an inn where we called on our return."</P>
<P>"Welcome then," cried I, "my child, and thou her gallant deliverer, a thou&s;and welcomes. Though our cheer is but wretched, yet our hearts are ready to re|ceive you. And now, Mr. Burchell, as you have de|livered my girl, if you think her a recompence &s;he is yours, if you can &s;toop to an alliance with a family &s;o poor as mine, take her, obtain her con&s;ent, as I know you have her heart, and you have mine. And let me tell you, Sir, that I give you no &s;mall trea&s;ure, &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been celebrated for beauty it is true, but that is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> meaning, I give you up a trea&s;ure in her mind."</P>

<P>"If your pre&s;ent objection," replied I, be meant as an eva&s;ion of my offer, I de&s;i&s;t: but I know no man &s;o worthy to de&s;erve her as you; and if I could give her thou&s;ands, and thou&s;ands &s;ought her from me, yet my hone&s;t brave Burchell &s;hould be my deare&s;t choice."</P>
<P>To all this his &s;ilence alone &s;eemed to give a mortify|ing refu&s;al, and without the lea&s;t reply to my offer, he, demanded if we could not be furni&s;hed with refre&s;hment from the next inn? To which being an&s;wered in the af|firmative, he ordered them to &s;end in the be&s;t dinner that could be provided upon &s;uch &s;hort notice. He be&s;poke al&s;o a dozen of their be&s;t wine; and &s;ome cordials for me. Adding, with a &s;mile, that he would &s;tretch a little for once, and tho' in a pri&s;on, a&s;&s;erted he was never better di&s;po&s;ed to be merry. The waiter &s;oon made his appearance with preparations for dinner, a table was lent us by the gaoler, who &s;eemed remarkably a&s;&s;iduous, the wine was di&s;po&s;ed in order, and two very well-dre&s;t di&s;hes were brought in.</P>
<P>My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy &s;ituation, and we all &s;eemed unwilling to damp her chearfulne&s;s by the relation. But it was in vain that I attempted to appear chearful, the circum|&s;tances of my unfortunate &s;on broke through all efforts to di&s;&s;emble: &s;o that I was at la&s;t obliged to damp our mirth by relating his misfortunes, and wi&s;hing that he might be permitted to &s;hare with us in this little interval of &s;atisfaction. After my gue&s;ts were recovered from the con&s;ternation my account had produced, I reque&s;ted al&s;o that Mr. Jenkin&s;on a fellow pri&s;oner might be ad|mitted, and the gaoler granted my reque&s;t with an air of vnu&s;ual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The clanking of my &s;on's irons was no &s;ooner heard along the pa&s;&s;age, than his &s;i&s;ter ran im|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ently to meet him; while Mr. Burchell in the mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;ked me if my &s;on's name was George, to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the affirmative, he &s;till continued &s;ilent.

<P>My &s;on &s;eemed all this while regardle&s;s of what I &s;aid, and &s;till continued fixed at re&s;pectful di&s;tance&mdash;"My dear brother," cried his &s;i&s;ter, "why don't you thank my good deliverer; the brave &s;hould ever love each other."</P>
<P>He &s;till continued his &s;ilence and a&s;toni&s;hment, till our gue&s;t at la&s;t perceived him&s;elf to be known, and a&s;&s;uming all his native dignity, de&s;ired my &s;on to come forward. Never before had I &s;een any thing &s;o truly maje&s;tic as the air he a&s;&s;umed upon this occa&s;ion. The greate&s;t object in the univer&s;e, &s;ays a certain philo&s;opher, is a good man &s;truggling with adver&s;ity; yet there is &s;till a greater, which is the good man that comes to relieve it. After he had regarded my &s;on for &s;ome time with a &s;u|perior air, "I again find," &s;aid he, "unthinking boy, that the &s;ame crime"&mdash;But here he was interrupted by one of the gaoler's &s;ervants, who came to inform us that a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, who had driven into town with a chariot and &s;everal attendants, &s;ent his re&s;pects to the gentleman that was with us, and begged to know when he &s;hould think proper to be waited upon.&mdash; "Bid the fellow wait, cried our gue&s;t, till I &s;hall have lei&s;ure to receive him;" and then turning to my &s;on, "I again find, Sir," proceeded he, "that you are guil|ty of the &s;ame offence for which you once had my reproof, and for which the law is now preparing its ju&s;te&s;t puni&s;hment. You imagine, perhaps, that a con|tempt for your own life, gives you a right to take that of another: but where, Sir, is the difference be|tween a dueli&s;t who hazards a life of no value, and the murderer who acts with greater &s;ecurity? Is it any di|minution of the game&s;ter's fraud when he alledges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t he has &s;taked a counter?"</P>
<P>"Alas, Sir," cried I, "whoever you are, pity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> poor mi&s;guided creature; for what he has done was in obedience to a deluded mother, who in the bitterne&s;s

of her re&s;entment required him upon her ble&s;&s;ing to avenge her quarrel. Here, Sir is the letter, which will &s;erve to convince you of her imprudence and dimini&s;h his guilt"</P>
<P>He took the letter and ha&s;tily read it over. "This," &s;ays he, though not a perfect excu&s;e, is &s;uch a palliation of his fault, as induces me to forgive him: And now, Sir" continued he, kindly taking my &s;on by the hand, "I &s;ee you are &s;urprized at finding me here; but I have often vi&s;ited pri&s;ons upon occa&s;ions le&s;s intere&s;t|ing. I am now come to &s;ee ju&s;tice done a worthy man, for whom I have the mo&s;t &s;incere e&s;teem. I have long been a di&s;gui&s;ed &s;pectator of thy father's benevolence. I have at his little dwelling enjoyed re&s;pect uncontamina|ted by flattery, and have received that happine&s;s that courts could not give, from the amu&s;ing &s;implicity round his fire-&s;ide. My nephew has been apprized of my in|tentions of coming here, and I find is arrived; it wou'd be wronging him and you to condemn him without examination: if there be injury, there &s;hall be redre&s;s; and this' I may &s;ay without boa&s;ting, that none have ever taxed the inju&s;tice of Sir William Thornhill.</P>
<P>We now found the per&s;onage whom we had &s;o long entertained as an harmle&s;s amu&s;ing companion, was no other than the celebrated Sir William Thornhill, to who&s;e virtues and &s;ingularities &s;carce any were &s;trangers. The poor Mr. Burchell was in reality a man of large for|tune and great intere&s;t, to whom &s;enates li&s;tened with applau&s;e, and whom party heard with conviction; who was the friend of his country, but loyal to his king. My poor wife recollecting her former familiarity, &s;eemed to &s;hrink with apprehen&s;ion; but Sophia, who a few mo|ments before thought him her own, now perceiving the immen&s;e di&s;tance to which he was removed by fortune, was unable to conceal her tears.</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir" cried my wife, with a piteous a&s;pect, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;ible that I can ever have your forgivene&s;s; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ts you received from me the la&s;t time I had the ho|nour of &s;eeing you at our hou&s;e, and the jokes&punc; which I audaciou&s;ly threw out, the&s;e jokes, Sir, I fear can never be forgiven."</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="012405_0161_0F897352B236F330">"My dear good lady," returned he with a &s;mile, "If you had your joke, I had my an&s;wer: I'll leave it to all the company if mine were not as good as yours.&mdash; To &s;ay the truth, I know no body whom I am di&s;po&s;ed to be angry with at pre&s;ent but the fellow who &s;o frighted my little girl here. I had not even time to examine the ra&s;cal's per&s;on &s;o as to de&s;cribe him in an adverti&s;ement. Can you tell me, Sophia, my dear, whe|ther you &s;hould know him again?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir," replied &s;he, "I can't be po&s;itive; yet now I recollect he had a large mark over one of his eye-brows." "I a&s;k pardon, madam," interrupted Jenkin&s;on, who was by, "but be &s;o good as to inform me if the fellow wore his own red hair?"&mdash;"Yes, I think &s;o," cried Sophia.&mdash;"And did your honour," continued he, turning to Sir William, "ob&s;erve the length of his legs?"&mdash;"I can't be &s;ure of their length," cried the Baronet, "but I am convinced of their &s;wiftne&s;s; for he out-ran me, which is what I thought few men in the kingdom could have done."&mdash;"Plea&s;e your ho|nour," cried Jenkin&s;on, "I know the man: it is cer|tainly the &s;ame; the be&s;t runner in England; he has beaten Pinwire of Newca&s;tle, Timothy Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter is his name, I know him perfectly, and the very place of his retreat this moment. If your honour will bid Mr. Gaoler let two of his men go with me, I'll engage to produce him to you in an hour at farthe&s;t. Upon this the gaoler was called, who in&s;tantly appearing, Sir William demanded if he knew him. "Yes, plea&s;e your honour," reply'd the gaoler, "I know Sir William Thornhill well, and every body that knows any thing of him, will de&s;ire to know more of him."&mdash;"Well then," &s;aid the baronet, "my reque&s;t is, that you will permit this man and two of your &s;ervants to go upon a me&s;&s;age by my authority and as I am in the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace, I undertake to &s;ecure you."&mdash;"Your promi&s;e is &s;ufficient," replied the other, and you may at a minute's warning &s;end them over England whenever your honour thinks fit."</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the gaoler's compliance, Jenkin&s;on was di&s;patched in &s;earch of Timothy Baxter, while we were amu&s;ed with the affiduity of our younge&s;t boy Bill, who
<PB N="164" REF="012405_0162_0F89735373B1FE58">
had ju&s;t come in and climbed up to Sir William's neck in order to ki&s;s him. His mother was immediately going to cha&s;ti&s;e his familiarity, but the worthy man prevented her; and taking the child, all ragged as he was, upon his knee, "What, Bill, you chubby rogue," cried he, "do you remember your old friend Burchell; and Dick too, my hone&s;t veteran, are you here, you &s;hall find I have not forgot you." So &s;aying, he gave each a large piece of gingerbread, which the poor fellows eat very heartily, as they had got that morning but a very &s;canty breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>We now &s;at down to dinner, which was almo&s;t cold; but previou&s;ly, my arm &s;till continuing painful, Sir, Wil|liam wrote a pre&s;cription, for he had made the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic his amu&s;ement, and was more than moderately &s;killed in the profe&s;&s;ion; this being &s;ent to an apothecary who lived in the place, my arm was dre&s;&s;ed, and I found almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous relief. We were waited upon at dinner by the gaoler him&s;elf, who was willing to do our gue&s;t all the honour in his power. But before we had well dined, another me&s;&s;age was brought from his ne|phew, de&s;iring permi&s;&s;ion to appear, in order to vindi|cate his innocence and honour, with which reque&s;t the baronet complied, and de&s;ired Mr. Thornhill to be in|troduced.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XII. Former benevolence now repaid with unexpected intere&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Thornhill made his entrance with a &s;mile, which he &s;eldom wanted, and was going to em|brace his uncle, which the other repul&s;ed with an air of di&s;dain. "No fawning, Sir, at pre&s;ent," cried the ba|ronet, with a look of &s;everity, "the only way to my heart is by the road of honour; but here I only &s;et complicated in&s;tances of fal&s;ehood, cowardice, and oppre&s;&s;ion. How is it, Sir, that this poor man, for whom I know you profe&s;&s;ed a friend&s;hip, is u&s;ed thus
<PB N="165" REF="012405_0163_0F897354F91FDEF0">
hardly? His daughter vilely &s;educed, as a recompence for his ho&s;pitality, and he him&s;elf thrown into a pri&s;on perhaps but for re&s;enting the in&s;ult? His &s;on too, whom you feared to face as a man&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible, Sir," interrupted his nephew, "that my uncle could object that as a crime which his re|peated in&s;tructions alone have per&s;uaded me to avoid." "Your rebuke," cried Sir, William, "is ju&s;t: you have acted in this in&s;tance prudently and well, though not quite as your father would have done: my brother indeed was the &s;oul of honour; but thou&mdash;yes you have acted in this in&s;tance perfectly right, and it has my warme&s;t approbation."</P>
<P>"And I hope," &s;aid his nephew, "that the re&s;t of my conduct will not be found to de&s;erve cen&s;ure. I appeared, Sir, with this gentleman's daughter at &s;ome places of public amu&s;ement: thus what was levity, &s;candal called by a har&s;her name, and it was reported that I had debauched her. I waited on her father in per&s;on, willing to clear the thing to his &s;atisfaction, and he received me only with in&s;ult and abu&s;e. As for the re&s;t, with regard to his being here, my attorney and &s;teward can be&s;t inform you, as I commit the management of bu&s;ine&s;s entirely to them. If he has contracted debts and is unwilling or even unable to pay them, it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to proceed in this man|ner, and I &s;ee no hard&s;hip or inju&s;tice in pur&s;uing the mo&s;t legal means of redre&s;s."</P>
<P>"If this, cried Sir William, "be as you have &s;tated it, there is nothing unpardonable in your offence; and though your conduct might have been more generous in not &s;uffering this gentleman to be oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;ubordi|nate tyranny, yet it has been at lea&s;t equitable."</P>
<P>"He cannot contradict a &s;ingle particular," replied the '&s;quire, "I defy him to do &s;o, and &s;everal of my &s;ervants are ready to atte&s;t what I &s;ay. Thus, Sir," continued he, finding that I was &s;ilent, for in fact I could not contradict him, "thus, Sir, my own innocence is vindicated; but though at your entreaty I am ready to forgive this gentleman every other offence, yet his attempts to le&s;&s;en me in your e&s;teem, excite a re&s;ent|ment that I cannot govern.&mdash;And this too at a time
<PB N="166" REF="012405_0164_0F897355F5254920">
when his &s;on was actually preparing to take away my life; this, I &s;ay, was &s;uch guilt, that I am determined to let the law take its cour&s;e. I have here the challenge that was &s;ent me and two witne&s;&s;es to prove it; and even though my uncle him&s;elf &s;hould di&s;&s;uade me, which I know he will not, yet I will &s;ee public ju&s;tice done, and he &s;hall &s;uffer for it."</P>
<P>"Thou mon&s;ter," cried my wife, "ha&s;t thou not had vengeance enough already, but mu&s;t my poor boy feel thy cruelty. I hope that good Sir William will protect us, for my &s;on is as innocent as a child; I am &s;ure he is, and never did harm to man."</P>
<P>"Madam," replied the good man, "your wi&s;hes for his &s;afety are not greater than mine; but I am &s;orry to find his guilt too plain; and if my nephew per&s;i&s;ts&mdash;" But the appearance of Jenkin&s;on and the gaoler's two &s;er|vants now called off our attention, who entered, haling in a tall man, very genteelly dre&s;t, and an&s;wering the de&s;cription already given of the ruffian who had carried off my daughter&mdash;"Here," cried Jenkin&s;on, pulling him in, "here we have him, and if ever there was a candidate for Tyburn, this is one."</P>
<P>The moment Mr. Thornhill perceived the pri&s;oner, and Jenkin&s;on who had him in cu&s;tody, he &s;eemed to &s;hrink back with terror. His face became pale with con&s;cious guilt, and he would have withdrawn; but Jenkin&s;on, who perceived his de&s;ign, &s;topt him&mdash; "What, '&s;quire, cried he, "are you a&s;hamed of your two old acquaintances, Jenkin&s;on and Baxter: but this is the way that all great men forget their friends, though I am re&s;olved we will not forget you.&mdash; Our pri&s;oner, plea&s;e your honour," continued he, turn|ing to Sir William, "has already confe&s;&s;ed all.&mdash; He declares that it was Mr. Thornhill who fir&s;t put him upon this affair, that he gave him the cloaths he now wears to appear like a gentleman, and furni&s;hed him with the po&s;t-chai&s;e. The plan was laid between them that he &s;hould carry off the young lady to a place of &s;afety, and that there he &s;hould threaten and terrify her; but Mr. Thornhill was to come in, in the mean time, as if by accident, to her re&s;cue, and that they &s;hould fight a while, and then he was to ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="167" REF="012405_0165_0F8973567299A4D0">
off, by which Mr. Thornhill would have the better op|portunity of gaining her affections him&s;elf under the cha|racter of her defender."</P>
<P>Sir William remembered the coat to have been fre|quently worn by his nephew, and all the re&s;t the pri&s;o|ner him&s;elf confirmed by a more circum&s;tantial account; concluding, that Mr. Thornhill had often declared to him that he was in love with both &s;i&s;ters at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>"Heavens," cried Sir William, "what a viper have I been fo&s;tering in my bo&s;om! And &s;o fond of public ju&s;tice too as he &s;eemed to be. But he &s;hall have it; &s;ecure him, Mr. Gaoler&mdash;yet hold, I fear there is not legal evidence to detain him."</P>
<P>Upon this, Mr. Thornhill, with the utmo&s;t humility, entreated that two &s;uch abandoned wretches might not be admitted as evidences again&s;t him, but that his &s;ervants &s;hould be examined.&mdash;"Your &s;ervants" replied Sir Wil|liam, "wretch, call them yours no longer: but come let us hear what tho&s;e fellows have to &s;ay, let his butler be called."</P>
<P>When the butler was introduced, he &s;oon perceived by his former ma&s;ter's looks that all his power was now over. "Tell me," cried Sir William &s;ternly, "have you ever &s;een your ma&s;ter and that fellow dre&s;t up in his cloaths in company together?" "Yes, plea&s;e your honour," cried the butler, "a thou&s;and times: he was the man that always brought him his ladies."&mdash; "How," interrupted young Mr. Thornhill, "this to my face!"&mdash;"Yes," replied the butler, "or to any man's face. To tell you a truth, ma&s;ter Thornhill, I never either loved you or liked you, and I don't care if I tell you now a piece of my mind."&mdash;"Now then," cried Jenkin&s;on, "tell his honour whether you know any thing of me."&mdash;"I can't &s;ay," replied the butler, "that I know much good of you. The night that gentleman's daughter was deluded to our hou&s;e, you were one of them,&mdash;"So then," cried Sir Wil|liam, "I find you have brought a very fine witne&s;s to prove your innocence: thou &s;tain to humanity! to a&s;&s;ociate with &s;uch wretches!" (But continuing his examination) "You tell me, Mr. Butler, that this
<PB N="168" REF="012405_0166_0F897357318FE1A8">
was the per&s;on who brought him this old gentleman's daughter,"&mdash;"No, plea&s;e your honour," replied the butler, "he did not bring her, for the '&s;quire him&s;elf undertock that bu&s;ine&s;s; but he brought the prie&s;t that pretended to marry them."&mdash;"It is but too true," cried Jenkin&s;on, "I cannot deny it, that was the em|ployment a&s;&s;igned me, and I confe&s;s it to my confu|&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the baronet, "how every new di&s;covery of his villainy alarms me. All his guilt is now too plain, and I find his pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution was dictated by tyranny, cowardice and revenge; at my reque&s;t, Mr. Gaoler, &s;et this young officer, now your pri&s;oner, free, and tru&s;t to me for the con&s;equences.&mdash; I'll make it my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;et the affair in a proper light to my friend the magi&s;trate who has committed him. But where is the unfortunate young lady her&s;elf: let her appear to confront this wretch, I long to know by what arts he has &s;educed her honour. Entreat her to come in. Where is &s;he?"</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir," &s;aid I, "that que&s;tion &s;tings me to the heart: I was once indeed happy in a daughter, but her mi&s;eries."&mdash;Another interruption here prevent|ed me; for who &s;hould make her appearance but Mi&s;s Arabella Wilmot, who was next day to have been mar|ried to Mr. Thornhill. Nothing could equal her &s;urprize at &s;eeing Sir William and his nephew here before her; for her arrival was quite accidental. It happened that &s;he and the old gentleman her father were pa&s;&s;ing through the town, on their way to her aunt's, who had in&s;i&s;ted that her nuptials with Mr. Thornhill &s;hould be con&s;um|mated at her hou&s;e; but &s;topping for refre&s;hment, they put up at an inn at the other end of the town. It was there from the window that the young lady happened to ob&s;erve one of my little boys playing in the &s;treet, and in&s;tantly &s;ending a footman to bring the child to her, &s;he learnt from him &s;ome account of our mi&s;fortunes; but was &s;till kept ignorant of young Mr. Thornhill's be|ing the cau&s;e. Though her father made &s;everal remon|&s;trances on the impropriety of going to a pri&s;on to vi&s;it us, yet they were ineffectual; &s;he de&s;ired the child to
<PB N="169" REF="012405_0167_0F897357F29E6790">
conduct her, which he did, and it was thus &s;he &s;urpri&s;ed us at a juncture &s;o unexpected.</P>
<P>Nor can I go on, without a reflection on tho&s;e acci|dental meetings, which, though they happen every day, &s;eldom excite our &s;urprize but upon &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ion. To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe every plea&s;ure and convenience of our lives. How many &s;eemiag accidents mu&s;t unite before we can be cloathed or fed. The pea&s;ant mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to labour, the &s;hower mu&s;t fall, the wind fill the merchant's fail, or numbers mu&s;t want the u&s;ual &s;upply.</P>
<P>We all continued &s;ilent for &s;ome moments, while my charming pupil, which was the name I generally gave this young lady, united in her looks compa&s;&s;ion and a&s;toni&s;hment, which gave new fini&s;hings to her beauty. "Indeed, my dear Mr. Thornhill," cried &s;he to the '&s;quire, who &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed was come here to &s;uccour and not to oppre&s;s us; "I take it a little unkindly that you &s;hould come here without me, or never inform me of the &s;ituation of a family &s;o dear to us both; you know I &s;hould take as much plea&s;ure in contributing to the relief of my reverend old ma&s;ter here, whom I &s;hall ever e&s;teem, as you can. But I find that, like your uncle, you take a plea&s;ure in doing good in &s;ecret."</P>
<P>"He find plea&s;ure in doing good!" cried Sir Wil|liam, interrupting her. "No, my dear, his plea&s;ures are as ba&s;e as he is.&mdash;You &s;ee in him, madam, as complete a villain as ever di&s;graced humanity. A wretch, who after having deluded this poor man's daughter, after plotting again&s;t the innocence of her &s;i&s;ter, has thrown the father into pri&s;on, and the elde&s;t &s;on into fetters, becau&s;e he had courage to face his betrayer.&mdash; And give me leave, madam, now to congratulate you upon an e&s;cape from the embraces of &s;uch a mon&s;ter."</P>
<P>"O goodne&s;s," cried the lovely girl, "how have I been deceived! Mr. Thornhill informed me for cer|tain that this gentleman's elde&s;t &s;on, Captain Primro&s;e, was gone off to America with his new-married lady."</P>
<P>"My &s;weete&s;t mi&s;s," cried my wife, "he has told you nothing but fal&s;ehoods. My &s;on George never left the kingdom, nor ever was married. Tho' you
<PB N="170" REF="012405_0168_0F897358B42AB4B0">
have for&s;aken him, he has always loved you too well to think of any body el&s;e; and I have heard him &s;ay "he would die a batchelor for your &s;ake." She then proceed|ed to expatiate upon the &s;ncerity of her &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;et his duel with Mr. Thornhill in a proper light, from thence &s;he made a rapid digre&s;&s;ion to the '&s;quire's debaucheries, his pretended marriages, and ended with a mo&s;t in&s;ulting picture of his cowardice.</P>
<P>"Good heavens!" cried Mi&s;s Wilmot, how very "near have I been to the brink of ruin! But how great is my plea&s;ure to have e&s;caped it! Ten thou&s;and fal&s;ehoods has this gentleman told me! He had at la&s;t art enough to per&s;uade me that my promi&s;e to the only man I e&s;teemed was no longer binding, &s;ince he had been un|faithful. By his fal&s;ehoods I was taught to dete&s;t one equally brave and generous!"</P>
<P>But by this time my &s;on was freed from the incum|brances of ju&s;tice. Mr. Jenkin&s;on al&s;o, who had acted as his valet de chambre, had dre&s;&s;ed up his hair, and fur|ni&s;hed him with whatever was nece&s;&s;ary to make a gen|teel appearance. He now therefore entered, hand&s;omely dre&s;t in his regimentals, and without vanity, (for I am above it) he appeared as hand&s;ome a fellow as ever wore a military dre&s;s. As he entered, he made Mi&s;s Wilmot a mode&s;t and di&s;tant bow, for he was not as yet acquaint|ed with the change which the eloquence of his mother had wrought in his favour. But no decorums could re|&s;train the impatience of his blu&s;hing mi&s;tre&s;s to be for|given. Her tears, her looks, all contributed to di&s;cover the real &s;en&s;ations of her heart for having forgotten her former promi&s;e, and having &s;uffered her&s;elf to be delud|ed by an impo&s;tor. My &s;on appeared amazed at her conde&s;cen&s;ion, and could &s;carce believe it real.&mdash;"Sure, madam," cried he, "this is but delu&s;ion! I can ne|ver have merited this! To be ble&s;t thus is to be too happy."&mdash;No, Sir, replied &s;he, "I have been de|ceived, ba&s;ely deceived, el&s;e nothing could have ever made me unju&s;t to my promi&s;e. You know my friend|&s;hip, you have long known it; but forget what I have done, and as you once had my warme&s;t vows of con|&s;tancy, you &s;hall now have them repeated; and be a&s;&s;ured that if your Arabella cannot be yours, &s;he &s;hall
<PB N="171" REF="012405_0169_0F89735971AD73F8">
never be another's."&mdash;"And no other's you &s;hall be," cried Sir William, "if I have any influence with your father."</P>
<P>This hint was &s;ufficient for my &s;on Mo&s;es, who imme|diately flew to the inn where the old gentleman was, to inform him of every circum&s;tance that had happened. But in the mean time the '&s;quire perceiving that he was on every &s;ide undone, now finding that no hopes were left from flattery and di&s;&s;imulation, concluded that his wi&s;e&s;t way would be to turn and face his pur&s;uers. Thus laying a&s;ide all &s;hame, he appeared the open hardy vil|lain. "I find then," cried he, "that I am to expect no ju&s;tice here; but I am re&s;olved it &s;hall be done me.&mdash; "You &s;hall know, Sir," turning to Sir William, "I am no longer a power depending upon your favours. I &s;corn them. Nothing can keep Mi&s;s Wilmot's fortune from me, which, I thank her father's a&s;&s;iduity, is pret|ty large. The articles, and a bond for her fortune, are &s;igned, and &s;afe in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It was her fortune, not her per&s;on, that induced me to wi&s;h for this match, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the one, let who will take the other."</P>
<P>This was an alarming blow, Sir William was &s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tice of his claims, for he had been in&s;trumen|tal in drawing up the marriage articles him&s;elf. Mi&s;s Wilmot therefore perceiving that her fortune was irre|trievably lo&s;t, turning to my &s;on, &s;he a&s;ked if the lo&s;s of fortune could le&s;&s;en her value to him. "Though for|tune." &s;aid &s;he, "is out of my power, at lea&s;t I have my hand to give."</P>
<P>"And that, madam," cried her real lover, was indeed "all that you ever had to give; at lea&s;t all that I ever thought worth the acceptance. And I now prote&s;t, my Arabella by all that's happy, your want of fortune this moment encrea&s;es my plea&s;ure, as it &s;erves to convince my &s;weet girl of my &s;incerity."</P>
<P>Mr. Wilmot now entering, he &s;eemed not a little plea&s;ed at the danger his daughter had ju&s;t e&s;caped, and readily con&s;ented to a di&s;&s;olution of the match. But finding that her fortune, which was &s;ecured to Mr. Thornhill by bond, would not be given up, nothing could exceed his di&s;appointment. He now &s;aw that his
<PB N="172" REF="012405_0170_0F89735A33372138">
money mu&s;t all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own. He could bear his being a ra&s;cal; but to want an equivalent to his daughter's fortune was wormwood. He &s;at therefore for &s;ome minutes employed in the mo&s;t mortifying &s;peculations till Sir William attempted to le&s;|&s;en his anxiety.&mdash;"I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Sir," cried he, "that your pre&s;ent di&s;appointment does not entirely di&s;plea&s;e me. Your immoderate pa&s;&s;ion for wealth is now ju&s;tly puni&s;hed. But tho' the young lady cannot be rich, &s;he has &s;till a competence &s;ufficient to give content. Here you &s;ee an hone&s;t young &s;oldier, who is willing to take her without fortune; they have long loved each other, and for the friend&s;hip I bear his father, my intere&s;t &s;hall not be wanting for his promotion. Leave then that ambi|tion which di&s;appoints you, and for once admit happi|ne&s;s which courts your acceptance"</P>
<P>"Sir William," replied the old gentleman, "be a&s;|&s;ured I never yet forced her inclinations, nor will I now. If &s;he &s;till continues to love this young gentleman, let her have him with all my heart. There is &s;till, thank heaven, &s;ome fortune left, and your promi&s;e will make it &s;omething more. Only let my old friend here (mean|ing me) give me a promi&s;e of &s;ettling &s;ix thou&s;and pounds upon my girl, if ever he &s;hould come to his fortune, and I am ready this night to be the fir&s;t to join them together."</P>
<P>As it now remained with me to make the young cou|ple happy, I readily gave a promi&s;e of making the &s;et|tlement he required, which to one who had &s;uch little expectations as I, was no great favour &mdash; We had now therefore the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing them fly into each other's arms in a tran&s;port. "After all my misfortunes." cried my &s;on George, "to be thus rewarded! Sure this is more than I could ever have pre&s;umed to hope for.&mdash; To be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all that's good, and after &s;uch an interval of pain! My warme&s;t wi&s;hes could never ri&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o high!"&mdash;"Yes, my George," returned his lovely bride, now let the wretch take my fortune; &s;ince you are happy without it, &s;o am I. O what an exchange have I made from the ba&s;e&s;t of men to the deare&s;t, be&s;t.&mdash;Let him enjoy our fortune, I now can
<PB N="173" REF="012405_0171_0F89735AF2BF6CB0">
be happy even in indigence."&mdash;"And I pro|mi&s;e you," cried the '&s;quire, with a malicious grin, "that I &s;hall be very happy with what you de&s;pi&s;e." &mdash;Hold, hold, Sir," cried Jenkin&s;on, "there are two words to that bargain.&mdash;As for that lady's fortune, Sir, you &s;hall never touch a &s;ingle &s;tiver of it. Pray your honour," continued he to Sir William, "can the '&s;quire have this lady's fortune if he be mar|ried to another?"&mdash;"How can you make &s;uch a &s;imple demand," replied the baronet, "undoubtedly he can|not."&mdash;"I am &s;orry for that," cried Jenkin&s;on; for as this gentleman and I have been old fellow &s;porters, I have a friend&s;hip for him. But I mu&s;t de|clare, well as I love him, that his contract is not worth a tobacco &s;topper, for he is married already." "&mdash;You lie like a ra&s;cal," returned the '&s;quire, who &s;eemed rouzed by this in&s;ult, "I never was legally married to any woman."&mdash;"Indeed, begging your honour's pardon," replied the other, "you were; and I hope you will &s;hew a proper return of friend|&s;hip to your own hone&s;t Jenkin&s;on, who brings you a wife, and if the company re&s;train their curio&s;ity a few minutes, they &s;hall &s;ee her."&mdash;So &s;aying he went off with his u&s;ual celerity, and left us all unable to form any probable conjecture as to his de&s;ign.&mdash;"Ay let him go," cried the '&s;quire, "whatever el&s;e I may have done I defy him there. I am too old now to be frightened with '&s;quibs."</P>
<P>"I am &s;urpri&s;ed," &s;aid the baronet, "what the fellow can intend by this. Some low piece of humour I &s;up|po&s;e!&mdash;"Perhaps, Sir," replied I, "he may have a more &s;erious meaning.&mdash;For when we reflect on the various &s;chemes this gentleman laid to &s;educe inno|cence, perhaps &s;ome one, more artful than the re&s;t, has been found able to deceive him. When we con|&s;ider what numbers he has ruined, how many parents now feel with angui&s;h the infamy and the contamina|tion which he has brought into their families, it would not &s;urpri&s;e me if &s;ome one of them.&mdash;Amazement! Do I &s;ee my lo&s;t daughter! Do I hold her! It is, it is my life, my happine&s;s. I thought thee lo&s;t, my Olivia, yet &s;till I hold thee&mdash;and &s;till &s;halt thou live

to ble&s;s me."&mdash;The warme&s;t tran&s;ports of the fonde&s;t lover were not greater than mine when I &s;aw him intro|duce my child, and held my daughter in my arms, who&s;e &s;ilence only &s;poke her raptures. "And art thou return|ed to me, my darling," cried I, "to be my comfort in age!"&mdash;"That &s;he is," cried Jenkin&s;on, "and make much of her, for &s;he is your own honourable child, and as hone&s;t a woman as any in the whole room, let the other be who &s;he will. And as for you, '&s;quire, as &s;ure as you &s;tand there, this young lady is your lawful wedded wife. And to convince you that I &s;peak no|thing but truth, here is the licence by which you were married together."&mdash;So &s;aying, he put the licence into the baronet's hands, who read it, and found it per|fect in every re&s;pect. "And now, gentlemen," con|tinued he, "I find you are &s;urpri&s;ed at all this; but a few words will explain the difficulty. That there '&s;quire of renown, for whom I have a great friend&s;hip, but that's between our&s;elves, has often employed me in doing odd little things for him. Among the re&s;t he commi&s;&s;ioned me to procure him a fal&s;e licence and a fal&s;e prie&s;t, in order to deceive this young lady. But as I was very much his friend, what did I do but I went and got a true licence and a true prie&s;t, and married them both as fa&s;t as the cloth could make them. Perhaps you'd think it was genero&s;ity that made me do all this. But no. To my &s;hame I confe&s;s it, my only de&s;ign was to keep the licence, and let the '&s;quire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper, and &s;o make him come down whenever I wanted money." A bur&s;t of plea&s;ure now &s;eemed to fill the whole apartment; our joy reached even to the common room, where the pri&s;oners them&s;elves &s;ympathized,

<P>Happine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s expanded upon every face, and even Oli|via's cheek &s;eemed flu&s;hed with plea&s;ure. To be thus re&s;tored to reputation, to friends and fortune at once was a rapture &s;ufficient to &s;top the progre&s;s of decay

and re&s;tore former health and vivacity. But perhaps among all there was not one who felt &s;incerer plea&s;ure than I. Still holding the dear-loved child in my arms, I a&s;ked my heart if the&s;e tran&s;ports were not delu&s;ion. "How could you," cried I turning to Mr. Jenkin&s;on, "how could you add to my mi&s;eries by the &s;tory of her death! But it matters not, my plea&s;ure at finding her again, is more than a recompence for the pain."</P>
<P>"As to your que&s;tion&punc;" replied Jenkin&s;on, "that is ea&s;ily an&s;wered. I thought the only probable means of freeing you from pri&s;on, was by &s;ubmitting to the '&s;quire, and con&s;enting to his marriage with the other young lady. But there you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living: there was therefore no other method to bring things to bear but by per|&s;uading you that &s;he was dead. I prevailed on your wife to join in the deceit, and we have not had a fit opportunity of undeceiving you till now."</P>
<P>In the whole a&s;&s;embly now there only appeared two faces that did not glow with tran&s;port. Mr. Thornhill's a&s;&s;urance had entirely for&s;aken him: he now &s;aw the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lph of infamy and want before him, and trembled to take the plunge. He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle, and in a voice of piercing mi&s;ery implored compa&s;&s;ion. Sir William was going to &s;purn him away, but at my reque&s;t be rai&s;ed him, and after pau&s;ing a few moments. "Thy vices, crimes, and ingratitude," cried he, "de&s;erves no tenderne&s;s; yet thou &s;halt not be en|tirely for&s;aken, a bare competence &s;hall be &s;upplied, to &s;upport the wants of life, but not its follies. This young lady, thy wife, &s;hall be put in po&s;e&s;&s;ion of a third part of that fortune which once was thine, and from her te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+derne&s;s alone thou art to expect any extraordinary &s;up|plies for the future." He was going to expre&s;s his gra|titude for &s;uch kindne&s;s in a &s;et &s;peech; but the Baronet prevented him by bidding him not to aggravate his mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;s, which was already but too aparent. He or|dered him at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me time to be gone&punc; and from all his former dome&s;tics to chu&s;e out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch as he &s;hould think p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">per, which was all that &s;hould be granted to amend him.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="012405_0174_0F89735E36E9BD40">As &s;oon as he left us, Sir William very politely &s;tept up to his new niece with a &s;mile, and wi&s;hed her joy.</P>
<P>His example was followed by Mi&s;s Wilmot and her father; my wife too ki&s;&s;ed her daughter with much affec|tion, as, to u&s;e her own expre&s;&s;ion, &s;he was now made an hone&s;t woman of. Sophia and Mo&s;es followed in turn, and even our benefactor Jenkin&s;on de&s;ired to be admit|ted to that honour. Our &s;atisfaction &s;eemed &s;carce capable of increa&s;e. Sir William, who&s;e greate&s;t plea|&s;ure was in doing good, now looked round with a coun|tenance open as the &s;un, and &s;aw nothing but joy in the looks of all except that of my daughter Sophia, who, for &s;ome rea&s;ons we could not comprehend, did not &s;eem perfectly &s;atisfied. "I think now," cried he, with a &s;mile, "that all the company, except one or two, &s;eem perfectly happy. There only remains an act of ju&s;tice for me to do. You are &s;en&s;ible, Sir," continued he, turning to me, "of the obligations we both owe Mr. Jenkin&s;on for his late a&s;&s;iduity in detecting a &s;coundrel. It is but ju&s;t we &s;hould both reward him for it.&mdash; Your younge&s;t daughter Mi&s;s Sophia, will, I am &s;ure, make him very happy, and he &s;hall have from me five hundred pounds as her fortune, and upon this I am &s;ure they can live very comfortably together. Come, Mi&s;s Sophia, what &s;ay you to this match of my making? Will you have him?"&mdash;My poor girl &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;inking into her mother's arms at the hideous propo&s;al.&mdash; "Have him, Sir!" cried &s;he faintly. "No, Sir, never." "What." cried he again, "not have Mr. Jenkin&s;on, your benefactor, an hand&s;ome young fellow, with five hundred pounds and good expectations!"&mdash;"I beg, Sir," returned &s;he, &s;carce able to &s;peak, "that you'll de&s;i&s;t, and not make me &s;o very wretched."&mdash;"Was ever &s;uch ob&s;tinacy known." cried he again, "to refu&s;e a man whom the family has &s;uch infinite obligations to, who pre&s;erved your &s;i&s;ter.

"My lovelie&s;t, my mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of girls." cried he, "how could you ever think your own Burchell could

deceive you, or that Sir William Thornhill could ever cea&s;e to admire a mi&s;tre&s;s that loved him for him&s;elf a|lone? I have for &s;ome years &s;ought for a woman, who, a &s;tranger to my fortune, could think that I had merit as a man. After having tried in vain, even among&s;t the pert and ugly, how great at la&s;t mu&s;t be my rapture to have made a conque&s;t over &s;uch &s;en&s;e and &s;uch heavenly beauty!" Then turning to Jenkin&s;on, "As I cannot, Sir, part with this young lady my&s;elf, for &s;he has taken a fancy to the cut of my face, all the recompence I can make is to give you her fortune; and you may call upon my &s;teward to-morrow for five hundred pounds." Thus we had all our compliments to repeat, and Lady Thorn|hill underwent the &s;ame round of ceremony that her &s;i&s;ter had done before. In the mean time Sir William's gentleman appeared to tell us that the equipages were ready to carry us to the inn, where every thing was pre|pared for our reception. My wife and I led the van, and left tho&s;e gloomy man&s;ions of &s;orrow. The gene|rous Baronet ordered forty pounds to be di&s;tributed a|mong the pri&s;oners, and Mr. Wilmot, induced by his ex|ample, gave half that &s;um. We were received below by the &s;houts of the villagers, and I &s;aw and &s;hook by the hand two or three of my hone&s;t pari&s;hioners, who were among the number. They attended us to our inn, where a &s;umptuous entertainment was provided&punc; and coar&s;er provi&s;ions di&s;tributed in great quantities among the po|pulace.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, as my &s;pirits were exhau&s;ted by the al|teration of plea&s;ure and pain which they had &s;u&s;tained during the day, I a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to withdraw, and leav|ing the company in the mid&s;t of their mirth, as &s;oon as I found my&s;elf alone, I poured out my heart in gratitude to the giver of joy as well as of &s;orrow, and then &s;lept undi&s;turbed till morning.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning as &s;oon as I awakened, I found my elde&s;t &s;on &s;itting by my bed-&s;ide, who came to encrea&s;e my joy with another turn of fortune in my fa|vour. Fir&s;t having relea&s;ed me from the &s;ettlement that I had made the day before in his favour, he let me know that my merchant who had failed in town was arre&s;ted at Antwerp, and there had given up effects to a much greater amount than what was due to his creditors. My boy's genero&s;ity plea&s;ed me almo&s;t as much as this unlooked for good fortune. But I had &s;ome doubts whether I ought in ju&s;tice to accept his offer. While I was pondering upon this, &s;ir Willi|am entered the room, to whom I communicated my doubts. His opinion was, that as my &s;on was already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very affluent fortune by his marriage, I might accept his offer without any he&s;itation. His bu&s;i|ne&s;s, however, was to inform me, that as he had the night before &s;ent for the licences, and expected them every hour, he hoped that I would not refu&s;e my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in making all the company happy that morning. A foot|man entered while we were &s;peaking, to tell us that the me&s;&s;enger was returned, and as I was by this time ready, I went down, where I found the whole company as mer|ry as affluence and innocence could make them. How|ever, as they were now preparing for a very &s;olemn ce|remony, their laughter entirely di&s;plea&s;ed me. I told them of the grave, becoming and &s;ublime deportment they &s;hould a&s;&s;ume upon this my&s;tical occa&s;ion, and read them two homilies and a the&s;is of my own compo&s;ition, in order to prepare them. Yet they &s;till &s;eemed perfectly refractory and ungovernable. Even as we were going along to church, to which I led the way, all gravity had quite for&s;aken them, and I was often tempted to turn back in indignation. In church a new dilemma aro&s;e, which promi&s;ed no ea&s;y &s;olution. This was, which couple &s;hould be married fir&s;t; my &s;on's bride warmly in&s;i&s;ted, That lady Thornhill (that was to be) &s;hould
<PB N="179" REF="012405_0177_0F897360325377F8">
take the lead; but this the other refu&s;ed with equal ar|dour, prote&s;ting &s;he would not be guilty of &s;uch rude|ne&s;s for the world. The argument was &s;upported for &s;ome time between both with equal ob&s;tinacy and good breeding. But as I &s;tood all this time with my book ready, I was at la&s;t quite tired of the conte&s;t, and &s;hutting it, "I perceive," cried I, "that none of you have a mind to be married, and I think we had as good go back again; for I &s;uppo&s;e there will be no bu&s;ine&s;s done here to-day."&mdash;This at once reduced them to rea&s;on. The Baronet and his Lady were fir&s;t married, and then my &s;on and his lovely partner.</P>
<P>I had previou&s;ly that morning given orders that a coach &s;hould be &s;ent for my hone&s;t neighbour Flamborough and his family, by which means, upon our return to the inn, we had the plea&s;ure of finding the two Mi&s;s Flam|boroughs alighted before us. Mr. Jenkin&s;on gave his hand to the elde&s;t, and my &s;on Mo&s;es led up the other: (and I have &s;ince found that he has taken a real liking to the girl, and my con&s;ent and bounty he &s;hall have whenever he thinks proper to demand them.) We were no &s;ooner returned to the inn, but numbers of my pari|&s;hioners, hearing of my &s;ucce&s;s, came to congratulate me, but among the re&s;t were tho&s;e who ro&s;e to re&s;cue me, and whom I formerly rebuked with &s;uch &s;harpne&s;s. I told the &s;tory to Sir William, my &s;on-in-law, who went out and reproved them with great &s;everity; but finding them quite di&s;heartened by his har&s;h reproof, he gave them half a guinea a-piece to drink his health, and rai&s;e their dejected &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Soon after this we were called to a very genteel enter|taiment, which was dre&s;t by Mr. Thornhill's cook. And it may not be improper to ob&s;erve with re&s;pect to that gentleman, that he now re&s;ides in quality of com|panion at a relation's hou&s;e, being very well liked and &s;eldom &s;itting at the &s;ide-table, except when there is no room at the other; for they make no &s;tranger of him. His time is pretty much taken up in keeping his relation, who is a little melancholy, in &s;pirits, and in learning to blow the French-horn. My elde&s;t daughter, however, &s;till remembers him with regret; and &s;he has even told me, though I make a great &s;ecret of it, that when he re|forms
<PB N="180" REF="012405_0178_0F897360F80C5F98">
&s;he may be brought to relent. But to return, for I am not apt to digre&s;s thus; when we were to &s;it down to dinner our ceremonies were going to be renewed. The que&s;tion was whether my elde&s;t daughter, as being a matron, &s;hould not &s;it above the two young brides, but the debate was cut &s;hort by my &s;on George, who propo&s;ed, that the company &s;hould &s;it indi&s;criminately, every gentleman by his lady. This was received with great approbation by all, excepting my wife, who I could perceive was not perfectly &s;atisfied, as &s;he ex|pected to have had the plea&s;ure of &s;itting at the head of the table and carving all the meat for all the company. But notwith&s;tanding this, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe our good humour. I can't &s;ay whether we had more wit among&s;t us now than u&s;ual; but I am certain we had more laughing, which an&s;wered the end as well. One je&s;t I particularly remember, old Mr. Wilmot drinking to Mo&s;es, who&s;e head was turned another way, my &s;on re|plied, "Madam, I thank you." Upon which the old gentleman, winking upon the re&s;t of the company, ob|&s;erved that he was thinking of his mi&s;tre&s;s. At which je&s;t I thought the two Mi&s;s Flamboroughs would have died with laughing. As &s;oon as dinner was over, accor|ding to my old cu&s;tom, I reque&s;ted that the table might be taken away, to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing all my fa|mily a&s;&s;embled once more by a chearful fire-&s;ide. My two little ones &s;at upon each knee, the re&s;t of the compa|ny by their partners. I had nothing now on this &s;ide of the grave to wi&s;h for, all my cares were over, my plea&s;ure was un&s;peakable. It now only remained that my gratitude in good fortune &s;hould exceed my former &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in adver&s;ity.</P>
