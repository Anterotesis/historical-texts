<HEAD>A PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> BRIDGWATER has been a Town favoured of GOD; yea, &s;ome Favours of Heaven unto it, have indeed been di&s;tingui&s;hing.</P>
<P>It was <HI>planted a Noble Vine.</HI>&mdash; And may no more of the Text from whence this Phra&s;e is borrowed, ever be applied unto it! The <HI>Fir&s;t Planters</HI> of it, were a &s;ett of People, who made RELIGION their main <HI>Intere&s;t</HI>; and it be|came their <HI>Glory.</HI> There was a Time&punc; when it &s;tood in a <HI>Land of unwalled Vill<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ages,</HI> with fierce Armies of Bloody <HI>Indians</HI> de&s;troying round about them; And the Di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD our SAVIOUR towards it at <HI>this time,</HI> were &s;o won|derful, that the &s;hort Report thereof given in, <HI>The Church-Hi&s;tory of New-England,</HI> is not un|worthy to be here tran&s;cribed and repeated.</P>
<Q><P>Remarkable was the Fate of <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> a mo&s;t <HI>Praying,</HI> and a mo&s;t <HI>Pious</HI> Town, &s;eated in the very <HI>mid&s;t</HI> of the Dangers of the <HI>War;</HI> that altho' they were often a&s;&s;aulted by formidable
<PB N="ii" REF="001888_0003_0FB9C6C33971FA78">
Numbers of the Enemies, yet in all their &s;harp A&s;&s;aults, they <HI>never lo&s;t one</HI> of their Inhabi|tants, Young or Old. They were &s;ollicited &s;trong|ly to de&s;ert their Dwellings: but they re&s;olved, that they would keep their <HI>Stations.</HI> And now on <HI>May 8. 1676.</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> began to Fire the Town; but the Inhabitants with notable Courage, i&s;&s;ued forth from their Garri&s;ons, to fight the Enemy; and <HI>GOD from Heaven</HI> at the &s;ame time fought for them, with a Storm of <HI>Lightning, Thunder, and Rain,</HI> whereby a con&s;iderable part of their Hou&s;es were pre&s;erved. Thou, Church of <HI>Bridgwater,</HI></P>
<P><HI>O niminus dilecta Deo, cui militat aether.</HI> One that was no <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> &s;o &s;ang the Favours of Heaven to the Emperour <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI>; and &s;o might the <HI>Pagan</HI> Foe now &s;ing of thy Salvations!</P></Q>
<P>Ever &s;ince that memorable Day, the Town has been proceeding, with the Smile of GOD upon them, and upon the Intentions of His Go&s;pel among them, until they are <HI>now become Two Bands.</HI> They are Lovingly and Peaceably &s;warmed into a <HI>New A&s;&s;embly,</HI> and began to meet in their <HI>New Edifice</HI> on a <HI>Day of Prayer</HI> (as 'tis the manner of <HI>New-England,</HI>) when the Two SERMONS were Preached, which the affected Hearers have here Publi&s;hed. GOD grant, that from the Tokens of His Gracious Pre&s;ence with them, the Place may claim the Name of, <HI>Mahanaim</HI>&punc; And may there be &s;till found among them &s;uch a Number of Lively, Watch|ful,

<HI>Fruitful Chri&s;tians,</HI> Exemplarily <HI>Living to GOD,</HI> and <HI>by the Faith of the Son of GOD</HI>; May a <HI>value</HI> for the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of our SAVI|OUR, be &s;o pre&s;erved in Vigour with them, and the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> thereof appear in all <HI>Real and Vital Godline&s;s</HI> quickened among the <HI>Young</HI> as well as the <HI>Old</HI> among them; And may their <HI>Brother|ly-Love continue</HI> at &s;uch a rate, that it may be plainly &s;een, GOD is yet among them. <HI>Wo to them, if I depart from them, &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>It has been a &s;ingular Felicity unto this Good People, that from the very Infancy of their Plan|tation, they have &s;att under the Mini&s;try of a Gra|cious, Faithful, Humble Servant of GOD, who <HI>continues with them to this Day.</HI> He has been a Precious <HI>Gift</HI> of our <HI>A&s;cended</HI> LORD un|to them; and they have hitherto <HI>Rejoyced in his Light;</HI> and <HI>We</HI> Rejoyce with them, that after Fifty Four Years, his <HI>Light</HI> yet &s;hines with &s;uch Brightne&s;s among them.</P>
<P>We can make no Doubt, but that, as they have grown into &s;uch Good Circum&s;tances under his painful and patient conduct, they will &s;tudy in all the Methods if Goodne&s;s, to render his <HI>Old Age</HI> comfortable to him, and &s;o multiply all the Offices and Expre&s;&s;ions of a <HI>Grateful People</HI> towards him, with an Affection and Reverence, like what the Church of <HI>Smyrna</HI> paid unto their Aged <HI>Po|lycarp,</HI> that he may anon Die, Ble&s;&s;ing of them,

<P>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of, by the Hou&s;e of I&s;|rael, to do it for them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Shall not in&s;i&s;t upon the Divi&s;ion of this Chapter, into the &s;everal parts of it; Only we may con&s;ider for an In|troduction to the Text, that from the four and twentieth ver&s;e to the clo&s;e of the Chapter, we have a Number of <HI>exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es</HI> made to <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; Promi&s;es both of Spiritual and Temporal Ble&s;&s;ings. In the fir&s;t place, there are Promi&s;es made to
<PB N="2" REF="001888_0007_0FB9C6CB8D6BAF28">
them of a <HI>new Heart</HI> and a <HI>right Spirit,</HI> pro|mi&s;es of <HI>Pardoning Mercy,</HI> and promi&s;es of Con|verting and Sanctifying Grace; and there|unto we have an addition of Promi&s;es re|&s;pecting <HI>Temporal Ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> the ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>In|crea&s;e,</HI> the Increa&s;e of Men, the ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>Peace,</HI> of quietne&s;s and &s;afety in their Dwel|lings; the Ble&s;&s;ings of plentiful Provi&s;ion in the increa&s;e of the Field, and the fruit of the Trees. After a long Enumeration of Divine Ble&s;&s;ings, the Lord &s;hews them in our Text, <HI>what is to be done</HI> on their part in order to the obtaining of the great Ble&s;&s;ings he doth pro|mi&s;e to be&s;tow upon them.</P>
<P>We may con&s;ider the Text, as it contains a &s;olemn Declaration; and therein we have,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t: The <HI>Author</HI> of it, and that is <HI>the Lord.</HI> That which we have in the Text was publi&s;h|ed and declared in a mini&s;terial way, by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> by divine In&s;piration and di|vine Authority; &s;o the Text expre&s;&s;eth, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God</HI>; It was from the Great and Glorious <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the Self-Exi&s;ting, the In|finite and Eternal Being, the Fountain of all being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly, We have the <HI>Object,</HI> unto whom this Declaration is directed, and that is <HI>The Hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> the Family, the Po&s;terity of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; who were &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the Nations, and taken into &s;pecial Covenant
<PB N="3" REF="001888_0008_0FB9C6CDA2661F30">
Relation unto God. As this is fir&s;tly and more immediately directed to the Church of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &s;o it is of concernment unto <HI>all the I&s;|rael of God,</HI> unto all the Churches and People of God thorow all Generations.</P>
<P>Thirdly. We have the <HI>way</HI> and <HI>means</HI> to be attended in order to the Enjoyment of the good which God hath promi&s;ed to be&s;tow; and therein we have</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The <HI>Duty</HI> enjoyned. <HI>I will yet be en|quired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael</HI>: That Enquiry mu&s;t be made by <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Supplication</HI> to God, not in a &s;light &s;uperficial way, but with great <HI>earne&s;tne&s;s</HI> and &s;o with <HI>per&s;everance</HI> in <HI>Prayer; Prayer</HI> notwith&s;tanding delays as to the Accompli&s;hment of Promi&s;es: <HI>I will yet be enquired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael</HI>; It mu&s;t be a careful and diligent Enquiry as Criticks ob&s;erve from the Hebrew Word <HI>Dare&s;h.</HI> Such mu&s;t the Enquiry be, of tho&s;e that would pre|vail with God.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We have the <HI>Good</HI> to be &s;ought for from the Lord; <HI>For this I will be enquired of that I may do it for them,</HI> i. e. that I may per|form my Word to them, that the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of Mercy and Ble&s;&s;ing I have made to them may have their Accompli&s;hment. That which is to be &s;ought for is here expre&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Sin|gular Number.</HI> We find in Scripture phra&s;e, the Singular Number put for the <HI>Plural,</HI> as em|phatical

and more comprehen&s;ive; and &s;o [<HI>This</HI>] may be taken as comprehending not only that particular promi&s;e immediately pre|ceeding the Text, but all the foregoing Pro|mi&s;es; But whether we take the Word [This] in a large or &s;trict &s;en&s;e, the Text will afford this plain genuine <HI>Doctrine,</HI></P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>That as the Lord hath made Promi&s;es of great Ble&s;&s;ings to his People, &s;o he will be enquired of by them; he will be &s;ought to in the way of Prayer and Supplication in order to the perfor|mance of that which he hath promi&s;ed, that he may do it for them.</P>

<P>This is that which God expects from his People, this is that he hath obliged them to, as to all the Good which he hath promi&s;ed to be&s;tow upon them; This is the great <HI>Means</HI> which God hath in&s;tituted, which mu&s;t be at|tended with the greate&s;t &s;eriou&s;sne&s;s and dili|gence, This is that the Lord in&s;i&s;ts upon in all Ca&s;es; <HI>He will be enquired of,</HI> He will have <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Supplication</HI> to be made to him in order to the Di&s;pen&s;ation of all Covenant Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>We may find the Doctrine confirmed by abundant Te&s;timony of the <HI>Holy Scripture.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001888_0010_0FB9C6D34F6AAF90">
Among many Scriptures which might be cited I would refer particularly and peculiarly unto that&punc; Jer. 29.11, 12, 13, 14. <HI>For I know the thoughts which I think towards you, &s;aith the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an ex|pected End; Then &s;hall ye call upon me and ye &s;hall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye &s;hall &s;eek me and find me, when ye &s;hall &s;earch for me with all your heart! and I will be found of you &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>For the opening of the Doctrine we are to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That God hath a <HI>People</HI> in the World, unto whom he hath made <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of great Ble&s;&s;ings. All the People in the World, the whole Po&s;terity of <HI>Adam</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively from Ge|neration to Generation, con&s;idered in their natural Apo&s;tatic State, have <HI>forfeited</HI> the Ble&s;&s;ing, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eparated from God, &s;eparated from his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and from Communion with God, and as Sinners, as Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the Law of God, are all ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to the <HI>cur&s;e of the Law,</HI> Gal. 3.10. Notwith&s;tanding God hath in infinite Mercy &s;ingled out a <HI>cer|tain Number</HI> of the lo&s;t Race of <HI>Adam</HI> to inhe|rit the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> After that Man had broken the <HI>Fir&s;t Covenant of Works,</HI> it plea&s;ed God to make a <HI>New Covenant</HI> with a <HI>Select Number</HI> of the Children of Men, a <HI>Covenant</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> and Mercy, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the hand of
<PB N="6" REF="001888_0011_0FB9C6D82AB21590">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Glorious <HI>Mediator,</HI> by whom all the Good of the Covenant is purcha&s;ed and conveyed; According to that Covenant God doth prepare and <HI>form a People for him&s;elf in the World, to be to the prai&s;e of his Glory.</HI> I&s;ai. 43.21. <HI>This People have I formed for my &s;elf, they &s;hall &s;hew forth my Prai&s;e.</HI> Such a People the Lord had under the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> di&s;pen|&s;ation; It was the great privilege of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> that they were &s;et apart to be a <HI>peculiar People unto God,</HI> Exod. 19.5. Such a People the Lord hath rai&s;ed up and multiplied and will yet multiply more and more, both among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> under the <HI>New-Te&s;tament</HI> di&s;pen|&s;ation, whom he will pre&s;erve through all Ge|nerations unto the Worlds End. The Grace and Mercy of the <HI>New-Covenant</HI> is di&s;played in the vi&s;ible Di&s;pen&s;ation of it in <HI>vi&s;ible Church Relation</HI> to God, in the outward Pri|vileges of the Covenant, the Mini&s;try of the Word and Sacraments, &amp;c. But more e&s;peci|ally in the &s;aving Di&s;pen&s;ation of it unto his Elect and Cho&s;en, unto all <HI>true Believers,</HI> to his called, his ju&s;tifyed and &s;anctifyed Ones. Such a Number the Lord hath among Men who are for a <HI>peculiar People</HI> to him. We have their Characters in the Word of Truth, where|by they are di&s;tingui&s;hing from all others in the World, as in, P&s;al. 15. They <HI>are &s;uch as walk uprightly, and work righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;peak
<PB N="7" REF="001888_0012_0FB9C6D9A8B60AF8">
the truth in their hearts.</HI> Again in, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 24.3, 4. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. at the beginning; and frequent|ly el&s;ewhere. It is to &s;uch that all the <HI>Pro|mi&s;es of Covenant Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> are made and con|firmed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; However they be de&s;|pi&s;ed by the Men of the World, yet they are the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord</HI>; On them the Lord will be&s;tow the Ble&s;&s;ings both of the <HI>upper and nether Springs,</HI> the Ble&s;&s;ings of Time and of Eternity.</P>
<P N="2">2. That &s;uch as live in the neglect of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Supplication</HI> to God, have no right to the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of God, they can lay no claim to any <HI>Covenant Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI> Such a number there is in the World, that have no regard to <HI>Prayer,</HI> and they are by far the greate&s;t Number among Men. It is &s;o univer&s;ally with the Race of <HI>Adam</HI> by nature. P&s;al. 14.2, 3. <HI>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, to &s;ee if there were any that did under&s;tand and &s;eek God, they are all gone a&s;ide.</HI> So, Rom. 3, 11. <HI>There is none that &s;eek after God:</HI> This is the black Character of all that are <HI>Ungodly,</HI> They <HI>call not upon the Lord,</HI> P&s;al. 14.4. Such is their State, that they do not &s;eek the Lord, they <HI>will not &s;eek after God,</HI> P&s;al. 10.4. In that re&s;pect they have <HI>no Right</HI> to any Cove|nant Ble&s;&s;ing. Indeed &s;uch may be favoured according to the <HI>Sovereign Will</HI> of God in the way of his <HI>Common Providence</HI> with many tem|poral
<PB N="8" REF="001888_0013_0FB9C6DB53B2FBE8">
Mercies, with the ble&s;&s;ings of Peace and Plenty, yea of all outward <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI>; they may be favoured with the outward vi&s;ible privileges of the Covenant&punc; but they can have nothing from God in a way of <HI>&s;pecial Favour and Covenant Mercy</HI>; in&s;tead of a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> they are expo&s;ed to the <HI>Cur&s;e,</HI> the Cur&s;e of the Lord. Such is the ca&s;e of all <HI>Prayerle&s;s</HI> Na|tions, and <HI>Prayerle&s;s</HI> Families, of every <HI>Prayer|le&s;s</HI> Society, or every individual Per&s;on in the World, that doth not <HI>&s;eek after God.</HI> P&s;al. 79.6. Jer. 10.25.</P>
<P N="3">3. As it is a <HI>moral Duty</HI> incumbent upon all Men to &s;eek the Lord by <HI>Prayer</HI>; &s;o it is eminently the Duty of the <HI>People of God</HI> to <HI>Pray,</HI> to pre&s;ent their Supplications to the Lord. I &s;ay, it is the Duty of <HI>all,</HI> of all Ranks, Orders and Degrees of Men to Pray. As the Divine Exi&s;tence, the Eternal Being of <HI>God</HI> is manife&s;t by the <HI>Light of Nature</HI>: So the Light and the Law of Nature doth oblige all to <HI>Pray to God.</HI> It is an Homage due to God as the Glorious Creator and Pre&s;erver of Men, as the Great <HI>Benefactor</HI> on whom all have their Dependance. It is a part of that <HI>natural Wor|&s;hip</HI> due to God which is required in the <HI>Fir&s;t Commandment,</HI> Exod. 20.3. There are indeed no Promi&s;es from God, that he will hear the <HI>Prayers</HI> of the <HI>Ungodly</HI>; they have no <HI>Faith</HI> and therefore he can take no plea&s;ure in their
<PB N="9" REF="001888_0014_0FB9C6E1B4ACA268">
<HI>Prayers.</HI> Heb. 11.6. <HI>Without faith it is im|po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e him.</HI> Neverthele&s;s &s;uch is the Goodne&s;s and Mercy of God, that his Ear is open to the cries of <HI>&s;uch</HI> in the Times of Trou|ble, P&s;al. 107.19. <HI>They cry unto the Lord in their Trouble, he &s;aveth them out of their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</HI> Many &s;uch In&s;tances there are in the way of his Providence.</P>
<P>But we are further to con&s;ider, That it is e|minently the Duty of the <HI>People of God</HI> to <HI>Pray</HI>; It is commended unto them, not only as a part of <HI>natural Wor&s;hip,</HI> but as a &s;pecial part of <HI>in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip</HI>; and they are under <HI>peculiar Obligations</HI> thereunto above all others in the World. This the Lord expects from the <HI>Hou&s;e of I&s;rael</HI>; &s;o the Text. As to all the Good that God hath promi&s;ed to his People, He will be <HI>enquired of,</HI> he will be &s;ought unto, that he may do it for them.</P>
<P>For the further Explication of this Head, there are divers things to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. That God hath given a <HI>Directory for Prayer.</HI> We have in the Holy Scriptures a compleat <HI>Directory</HI> with re&s;pect to all the parts of Religious <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and particularly of <HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot give you a better Definition of Prayer than that you have in the <HI>A&s;&s;emblies Catechi&s;m</HI> wherein you have been in&s;tructed, as it is drawn from the Word of God.</P>
<P>All Prayer mu&s;t be directed to <HI>God,</HI> as the
<PB N="10" REF="001888_0015_0FB9C6E36CFC5B80">
One only Object of all Religious Wor&s;hip, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.10. It is the Glory of the Lord to be the <HI>Hearer of Prayer,</HI> and his <HI>Glory he will not give to another,</HI> P&s;al. 65.1.2.</P>
<P>As Prayer mu&s;t be made to the One True and Living <HI>God,</HI> &s;o in the <HI>Name</HI> of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in His Name alone, as he is the One only <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and Man. 1 Tim. 2.5. in who&s;e <HI>Name</HI> alone we are commanded and encouraged to ask.

<P N="3">3. It is the Duty of the People of God to wait on the Lord, both in the way of <HI>Or|dinary</HI> and <HI>Extraordinary Prayer</HI>: and &s;o it mu&s;t be con&s;idered,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is an <HI>Ordinary Cour&s;e of Prayer</HI> to be attended by all that would approve them|&s;elves to God. <HI>Prayer</HI> mu&s;t be the <HI>con&s;tant Exerci&s;e</HI> of the Saints and People of God; and &s;o Prayer is to be con&s;idered both as <HI>mental</HI> and <HI>vocal.

and to &s;uch a degree, as may be mo&s;t &s;ub|&s;ervient to the Honour and Glory of God, our per&s;onal Relief, the Comfort and Edification of others.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Ordinary Prayer,</HI> it is further to be con|&s;idered, that there are divers ways of Prayer to be attended. There is the Duty of <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> of Praying &s;ingly and apart, of per&s;o|nal and particular Application to God, which ought to be and will be the <HI>daily Exerci&s;e</HI> of all that belong to God. Mat. 6.6. <HI>When thou praye&s;t, enter into thy clo&s;et, and pray to thy Father which is in &s;ecret.</HI> The Children of God have many <HI>&s;ecret Ca&s;es</HI> of Prayer, many <HI>&s;ecret</HI> wants and nece&s;&s;ities both Temporal and Spiritual, to pre&s;ent to him, &s;uch as the World doth not know and &s;uch as are not meet for the World to know. The <HI>Life of Religion</HI> depends much upon that way of Conver&s;e with God by <HI>Se|cret Prayer.</HI> Again, There is the Duty of <HI>Family Prayer</HI> to be attended by Heads of <HI>Fa|milies</HI> with tho&s;e that appertain to them: There are many Obligations upon the Servants of God to attend that Duty, to pre&s;ent to God a <HI>Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer</HI>; and there are &s;uch <HI>Examples</HI> of Devotion left on Sacred Record, which may convince all that will con&s;ult the Oracles of God, that <HI>Family Prayer</HI> is an e&s;&s;ential part of practical Godli|ne&s;s; as that of <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 18.19. Al&s;o
<PB N="14" REF="001888_0019_0FB9C6EF5DBDA5C0">
&s;ee Jo&s;h. 24.25. Job. 1.5. All <HI>Heads of Fa|milies</HI> that would approve them&s;elves to God, mu&s;t <HI>walk within their Hou&s;es with a perfect Heart,</HI> according to that great Example, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 101.2. There can be no Evidence of Since|rity with &s;uch as live in the habitual Neglect of <HI>Family Prayer</HI>; however &s;uch may <HI>think them&s;elves &s;omething, they are nothing,</HI> their <HI>Reli|gion is vain.</HI></P>
<P>Again, With re&s;pect to <HI>Ordinary Prayer,</HI> there mu&s;t be <HI>Publick Prayers</HI> made to God in Church A&s;&s;embles. <HI>Acts&punc;</HI> 2.42. <HI>Prayer</HI> is a &s;pecial part of that <HI>Publick Wor&s;hip</HI> which is to be performed to God on the Sabbath; All other Ordinances mu&s;t be attended with <HI>Prayer,</HI> as the Mini&s;terial Di&s;pen&s;ation of the <HI>Word,</HI> the Admini&s;tration of the Holy <HI>Sacraments,</HI> the Seals of the <HI>Covenant</HI>; all mu&s;t be accompa|nied with Prayers and Supplications unto God.</P>
<P N="2">2 It is to be con&s;idered, that there are <HI>Ex|traordinary Prayers</HI> to be made to God by his People; as they are liable to <HI>Extraordinary Di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> of Providence, &s;o they are to &s;eek God by <HI>Extraordinary Prayer</HI> as the great means of their relief in all Ca&s;es of di&s;tre&s;s. So God is to be &s;ought by <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> by a particular and per&s;onal Application to him; for this we have many Examples pre&s;ented to us, as that of <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 32.24, 25. Ho&s;. 12.4. <HI>He wept
<PB N="15" REF="001888_0020_0FB9C6F040D8A8D8">
and made Supplication</HI>; of <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 35.13. <HI>I humbled my Soul with Fa&s;ting and my Prayer re|turned into mine own bo&s;om</HI>; of <HI>Daniel,</HI> Dan. 6.10. Above all we have the Example of our Lord Chri&s;t, Luk. 6.12. Luk. 22.44. <HI>Be|ing in an agony, he prayed the more earne&s;tly.</HI></P>
<P>And as <HI>Extraordinary Prayer</HI> is to be made in <HI>Secret</HI> &s;ingly and apart; &s;o al&s;o by <HI>Families,</HI> 1 Cor. 7.5. There are many <HI>Family Ca&s;es</HI> which call for &s;uch Prayer.</P>
<P>Withal, there are <HI>Extraordinary Prayers</HI> to be made to God by his People in their <HI>Publick A&s;&s;emblies.</HI> Times and Ca&s;es of <HI>Extraordinary di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> call for &s;uch Prayer. For this we have plain Commands and great Examples, which &s;tand for our in&s;truction and imitation, as 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20. <HI>Joel</HI> 2.15, 16. <HI>Act.</HI> 12.5. Such Prayer is nece&s;&s;ary for the preventing and removing of &s;pecial Plagues and Judg|ments, and in order to the obtaining &s;pecial Mercies, po&s;itive, <HI>Extraordinary Ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> both Temporal and Spiritual. As there are times of <HI>extraordinary di&s;tre&s;s</HI> that pa&s;s upon the Peo|ple of God, wherein they are to Pray in an <HI>extraordinary way</HI>; &s;o there are <HI>extraordinary Communications</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> in &s;uch times of di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. Thus God doth di&s;pen&s;e to his People, as he is gracious and merciful, abundant in goodne&s;s and truth; when God doth &s;o di&s;pen&s;e, it is an evident
<PB N="16" REF="001888_0021_0FB9C6F21094B870">
<HI>Token for Good</HI>; when his People follow him with a &s;trong current of Prayer, it is an <HI>hope|ful Sign</HI> of &s;ome great work to be done, &s;ome great Salvation from the Lord near to be re|vealed. The greate&s;t Mercies are obtained in that way of Prayer; &s;o we may find from, Jer. 31.18, 19, 20. <HI>I have heard Ephraim be|moaning him&s;elf, turn thou me and I &s;hall be turn|ed</HI>; Upon that earne&s;t cry of <HI>Ephraim</HI> we have that return from the Lord, <HI>I will &s;urely have mercy upon him.</HI> So Jer. 50.45. <HI>In tho&s;e days and in that time, &s;aith the Lord, the children of I&s;rael &s;hall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping, they &s;hall go and &s;eek the Lord their God, They &s;hall ask the way to Sion, with their faces thitherward.</HI> The An&s;wer to tho&s;e Prayers we have in that which follows, ver. 18, 19, 20. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts the God of I&s;rael, Behold I will puni&s;h the King of Ba|bylon and his Land, as I have puni&s;hed the King of A&s;&s;yria and I will bring I&s;rael again to his habi|tation&mdash;In that time, &s;aith the Lord, the ini|quity of I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;ought for and there &s;hall be none, and the &s;ins of Judah and they &s;hall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I re&s;erve.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That God hath laid him&s;elf under <HI>En|gagements</HI> to his People who <HI>Enquire</HI> after him and Pray unto him, that he will <HI>hear their Prayers.</HI> As the Lord hath laid many <HI>Com|mands</HI> upon his People to make their Suppli|cations

This is that we ought to remember in all the <HI>Prayers</HI> we pre&s;ent to God, that he is <HI>able</HI> to do and <HI>will</HI> do according to that which he hath pro|mi&s;ed.

<P><PB N="11" REF="001888_0048_0FB9C734AF123B60">The&s;e Con&s;iderations being premi&s;ed, let us Explain the parts of the Doctrine.</P>
<P>PROP. I. The <HI>Building up of Sion</HI> is <HI>God's peculiar Work,</HI> in the carrying on of which work the Glory of God doth eminently ap|pear, and is di&s;played.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Invi&s;ible work of <HI>Grace</HI> in the Souls of the Elect is the <HI>peculiar Work of God</HI> by his Holy Spirit; in the beginning and progre&s;s of this work of Grace, the Lord doth <HI>appear in his Glory</HI> unto each of their Souls. The cal|ling and gathering of them out of the World (which <HI>lyes in wickedne&s;s</HI>) unto him&s;elf by an holy and effectual calling unto their real and thorough <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> is a glorious <HI>Creation-work</HI> of God: &s;o is al&s;o the <HI>pre&s;erving</HI> of Grace a|live in them and maintaining it in exerci&s;e and cau&s;ing it to grow in &s;trength and to higher degrees of Perfection, notwith&s;tanding all the force and fraud u&s;ed by Satan and the car|nal World to weaken and extingui&s;h Grace in them, were it po&s;&s;ible. The Beauty and Glo|ry of the <HI>Grace, Wi&s;dom, Power,</HI> and of the other Attributes of God &s;hining forth in the begin|ning, upholding, increa&s;ing and perfecting the work of Grace in the Souls of his Elect &s;hall at the la&s;t day be <HI>admired in all tho&s;e that be|lieve,</HI> 2 The&s;. 1.10. Indeed God conde&s;cends to make u&s;e of the Preaching of the Word, and of the outward means of Grace, in car|rying

on this Work; but until Men do hear the voice of God &s;peaking to their hearts as well as the voice of Men &s;peaking to their ears they will not be Converted; until they feel the power of <HI>God's Spirit,</HI> which goes beyond any humane power in the efficacy of it, their <HI>hard Hearts</HI> will not be broken for and from Sin, nor their <HI>blind Minds</HI> be &s;avingly enligh|tened in the knowledge of Chri&s;t &s;o as to be|lieve in him for Salvation, nor will their <HI>love to Sin</HI> be turned to an hatred thereof, nor will they accept of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and &s;ubmit to him in all his Offices and Ordinances and upon his own Terms on which he is offered in the Go&s;pl.</P>
<P>And after Men are Converted the &s;ame Divine creating power doth <HI>appear in its Glory</HI> to pre&s;erve Grace alive in their Souls. We need the <HI>fre&s;h Anointings</HI> of the Spirit to give new &s;upplies of &s;trength and nouri&s;hment un|to Faith and every other Grace in us: we need to have our <HI>Souls watered</HI> every moment from above to pre&s;erve Grace in a thriving and flouri&s;hing &s;tate in our Souls: we need the help of God to recover us from decays in Grace, to quicken and revive Grace in us, to &s;trengthen us with might in <HI>the inner man by the Glorious Power</HI> of his Holy Spi|rit, to enable us to get a victory over <HI>Sin</HI> dwelling in us, and over <HI>Satan</HI> and the <HI>World</HI> without us, which are the Enemies that fight

<P>This internal <HI>Building up of Zion</HI> in the hearts of the Elect, is that peculiar work of God which he chiefly aims at and intends to &s;ee accompli&s;hed in this World; and there|fore is <HI>the World</HI> it&s;elf pre&s;erved in its being 'till all the Elect of God are born into an Ex|i&s;tence in the World and New-born unto Chri&s;t by their Regeneration: All other the works of <HI>Divine Providence</HI> are put in &s;ub&s;er|viency unto this great work of the calling home of the Elect unto Chri&s;t, even as <HI>many as were fore-ordained unto Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Building up of Sion Vi&s;ibly,</HI> or the upholding and enlarging the Vi&s;ible Church is the <HI>peculiar work</HI> of God, in effecting where|of he doth <HI>appear in his Glory.</HI> For, God is wont to carry on his <HI>invi&s;ible work</HI> in the Hearts of his Elect, by the <HI>outward means</HI> of Grace, by the Word Preached and by Ordi|nances admini&s;tred; therefore for the Elects &s;ake God will uphold and pre&s;erve a <HI>Vi&s;ible Sion</HI> or Church &s;tate upon Earth, until all his Elect are gathered in unto Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And God has promi&s;ed that Chri&s;t &s;hall <HI>&s;ee his Seed,</HI> that is, &s;hall have a <HI>Vi&s;ible Seed</HI> upon

Earth in all Generations, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 53.9. Al&s;o it is for the declarative or manife&s;tative <HI>Glory</HI> of God in the World, that a <HI>Vi&s;ible Church</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;erved therein. The forming or plan|ting of <HI>Churches,</HI> the new forming or giving forth new Editions of the Church, the Refor|mations of it in the &s;everal ages of the World; the defending of it again&s;t its Enemies, are &s;uch di&s;plays of the Wi&s;dom, Power, Faith|fulne&s;s and Grace of God, yea of all his At|tributes, that it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that the Lord doth <HI>appear in his Glory</HI> here on Earth, when this good work is going forward.</P>
<P>God the <HI>Father</HI> hath therefore in his Eter|nal Coun&s;els re&s;olved that Chri&s;t &s;hall have a <HI>Vi&s;ible Kingdom</HI> upon Earth, and the contrary <HI>works of the Devil</HI> &s;hall be de&s;troyed; by means whereof the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall be glori|fied upon Earth. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 22.22, 27, 30, 31.</P>
<P>Take &s;ome In&s;tances of the <HI>Glorious Appea|rances</HI> of God in building up his Vi&s;ible Church and Kingdom upon Earth.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) There was a <HI>Vi&s;ible Church</HI> erected or formed in <HI>Adam's</HI> Family, after his Fall: The foundation on which it was built, was the <HI>promi&s;ed Seed,</HI> the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> that <HI>Seed of the Woman who was to break the Serpents head,</HI> who was to come into the World to <HI>de&s;troy the works of the Devil.</HI> In that Church, the Wor&s;hip of God by <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> was upheld, and there was <HI>Church
<PB N="15" REF="001888_0052_0FB9C73FA6D1BE80">
Di&s;cipline</HI> exerci&s;ed therein, as when <HI>Cain</HI> was rejected from the enjoyment of the pre&s;ence of God in his Hou&s;e and Ordinances. In <HI>A|dam's Family</HI> was formed the fir&s;t <HI>Vi&s;ible Go&s;pel Church</HI> that ever was in the World.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Lord did <HI>appear in His Glory</HI> to build up his Church Vi&s;ible in the days of <HI>Noah:</HI> with him was the Covenant of Grace renewed; by him who was a <HI>Preacher of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> was Chri&s;t preached; and by the <HI>Ark</HI> a Type of Chri&s;t, Men were taught that in Chri&s;t only Mankind could be &s;aved from the deluge of Eternal Wrath: al&s;o <HI>Laws</HI> of Wor|&s;hip were given to <HI>Noah</HI>; and the apo&s;tatized World of Men, were &s;wept out of the World by that univer&s;al Flood, that they might no longer ob&s;truct the thriving and flouri&s;hing of the true Religion upon Earth, &s;eeing they were become incorrigible in their Sins. Thus we &s;ee that God was content to part with a <HI>whole World</HI> of &s;inful Men, rather than <HI>Religion</HI> &s;hould not be upheld in the World; rather than Sinners by their numerou&s;ne&s;s and mul|titude &s;hould ob&s;truct the work of <HI>Reformation</HI> and the Progre&s;s of <HI>Religion</HI> upon Earth.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Another remarkable Period, wherein the Lord did appear in his Glory for the <HI>Build|ing of Sion,</HI> was at the time of the <HI>Di&s;per&s;ion</HI> of Mankind by the confu&s;ion of their Languages at <HI>Babel.</HI> For hereby va&s;t number of <HI>Hypo|crites</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001888_0053_0FB9C7425CE9EE88">
were &s;eparated from the true Church and purged out from fellow&s;hip with the Church; while <HI>Religion</HI> (and probably the <HI>Original Language</HI> al&s;o) was pre&s;erved in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Shem,</HI> the Father of <HI>Heber,</HI> Gen. 10.21. who would not (as is conceived) joyn with the re&s;t in building the Tower of <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P>And this <HI>Confu&s;ion of Languages</HI> proved a Bar to hinder the re&s;t of the World from hold|ing Communion with the true Church, nor was this Bar or <HI>Partition Wall</HI> remov'd 'till <HI>Chri&s;t made Peace by the Blood of the Cro&s;s</HI> and obtained the <HI>Gift of Tongues</HI> in order to the publi&s;hing of the Go&s;pel among all Nations, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) Another remarkable Period, wherein God appeared in his Glory for the <HI>Building up of Sion,</HI> was when God renewed his Co|venant with <HI>Abraham.</HI> For, tho' during tho&s;e Ten Generations from the Confu&s;ion of Lan|guages at <HI>Babel</HI> until the time of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Church enjoyed a Mini&s;try by excellent Tea|chers, for <HI>Noah</HI> lived <HI>Three Hundred &amp; Forty Years</HI> after the Flood, and &s;erved in the Church as a great Prophet, as al&s;o <HI>Shem</HI> was pre&s;erved in life 'till <HI>Abrahams</HI> time, and <HI>Melchizedeck,</HI> who was a <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> to offer Sacrifices and to ex|plain the meaning of them, as well as a <HI>King</HI> to do Ju&s;tice. Yet <HI>Religion</HI> was before the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of <HI>Abraham</HI> almo&s;t extinct in the World,
<PB N="17" REF="001888_0054_0FB9C748CB51A0F8">
being mi&s;erably decayed and corrupted: The Lord therefore thought it high time to <HI>appear in his Glory</HI> for the pre&s;ervation and re&s;toration of it: by calling <HI>Abraham</HI> to &s;eparate him&s;elf even from his Fathers Hou&s;e and his Native Land, and by revealing him&s;elf unto <HI>Abraham</HI> and Covenanting with him to be a <HI>God to him and to his Seed</HI>; and made him the <HI>Father</HI> in re&s;pect of this Covenant renewed with him, not only of his own natural Seed but of his <HI>adopted Seed in all Nations,</HI> namely, of all that &s;hould have the like Faith in the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> which was wrought in <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 12.1. and he became <HI>Heir of the World</HI> or of the Church in the World, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.11, 12, 13. and thus in <HI>Abrahams Family</HI> God pre&s;erved a <HI>Seed to &s;erve him,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;ht from the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tate World.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Another Period of time wherein there was a very <HI>Glorious Appearance</HI> of God for the Building up of the Church, was in the time of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> For <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> were become very ignorant, and being kept like Slaves and Drudges under their Taskma&s;ters, laboured under woful di&s;advantages for the upholding of Religion and the Wor&s;hip of God. The Lord, rather than <HI>Religion</HI> &s;hould be wholly lo&s;t upon Earth, was plea&s;ed by remarkable works of Providence to revive it out of the a&s;hes. He rai&s;ed up <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> reveal'd him&s;elf
<PB N="18" REF="001888_0055_0FB9C74A30780138">
to him from Heaven, taught <HI>I&s;rael</HI> the Ten Commandments from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> appointed Ordinances of Wor&s;hip and the Rules of a <HI>Church State</HI> as well as of a well ordered Civil Polity: which Laws and Ordinances Cere|monial and Judicial were of force for the &s;pace of <HI>Fifteen Hundred Years,</HI> namely 'till the coming of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Yet in this interval between <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Church fell under woful Degene|racies and Apo&s;tacy into Vice and Idolatry; &s;o that God was provoked to &s;end them into <HI>Babylon</HI> for Seventy Years. But at the end of that term it plea&s;ed God to proceed to a <HI>New Forming</HI> of his Church that he might have a People &s;et apart <HI>for him&s;elf to &s;hew forth his Prai&s;e</HI> vi&s;ibly on Earth, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 43.21. and the <HI>Temple</HI> was rebuilt and the Ordinances of Divine Wor&s;hip again &s;et up: This our Text &s;eems to refer unto.</P>
<P>But at length the Jews fell to idolizing the very Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> expecting <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> by the literal ob&s;ervance of it; which was a great di&s;honour to Chri&s;t the true <HI>Mediator,</HI> that the <HI>Shadow</HI> &s;hould be preferr'd before the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI>; yet thus they did, for under an Opinion of being &s;teady <HI>Di&s;ciples of Mo&s;es,</HI> they refu&s;ed to become <HI>Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hence at this time and age of the World, there was as much need of <HI>making all things</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="001888_0056_0FB9C74BD92A4A90">
new, or of new forming the Church as there was at the time of <HI>Noahs</HI> Flood, when the <HI>whole World had corrupted their ways</HI>; and as there was in any other of the aforementioned Periods.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) Hereupon, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> appeared in the World, as the greate&s;t of Prophets and the chief Builder to carry on this work of <HI>Building up the Church</HI> and to ren|der the &s;tate of it &s;till more glorious.

No|thing can hurt us but <HI>Sin</HI>; Sin provokes the Lord to withdraw him&s;elf from particular Per&s;ons, who indulge them&s;elves therein. <HI>Fa|mily Sins</HI> unreformed provoke the Lord to hide him&s;elf from &s;uch Families; and the pre|vailing <HI>Sins of the Place</HI> and People where we live, bring down the Judgments of Heaven upon the Publick Society and procure the Frowns and Rebukes of God upon us: and bring a bla&s;t on Mens endeavours, tho' the work be materially Good which they &s;et a|bout. Let each of us labour to find out his own iniquity; and lament it before the Lord. Is there any Sin, which we have not yet re|pented of and reformed? Let us do it <HI>now,</HI> for in this work we are engaging in, the God with whom we have to do is an <HI>Holy God,</HI> of <HI>purer Eyes than to behold iniquity</HI> with any ap|probation thereof.</P>
<P>Let us lament the <HI>pride</HI> of our hearts, the <HI>vanity</HI> and <HI>carnality</HI> of our minds, our confor|mity

to the &s;inful cour&s;es of the <HI>carnal World,</HI> the <HI>coldne&s;s</HI> and lukewarmne&s;s of our Affecti|ons towards God and Religion, our back|wardne&s;s and indi&s;po&s;edne&s;s to that which is Good, our want of <HI>Zeal</HI> again&s;t Vice, and that we have mourned and grieved &s;o little for the Sins prevailing in the Time and Place where we have lived, and that we have neg|lected to u&s;e our utmo&s;t influence and intere&s;t for the reforming of them. Let us mourn for our <HI>Barrenne&s;s</HI> under the means of Grace, and that &s;o many of us are not yet laid as poli&s;hed <HI>Stones in God's Building,</HI> namely <HI>The Church.</HI> That we have lived in Omi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Family Prayer</HI> and of the Holy <HI>Ordinances</HI> of Divine In&s;titution: that we have been too negligent in giving good Coun&s;el, Exhortations and Reproofs unto others, e&s;pecially to our own Children and Inferiours. And whatever o|ther Sin our Con&s;ciences cannot but charge us with, upon &s;erious Self-Examination; Let us mourn for it before the Lord this day.</P>

the Remi&s;&s;ion of all our Sins, that we may be clean&s;ed from the Guilt and Filth of them; that through Chri&s;t our <HI>Peace</HI> may be renewed with God, all matter of Controver&s;y between God and us removed; and that we may ob|tain well-grounded hopes, that God will <HI>not hide</HI> him&s;elf from us or withdraw his gracious pre&s;ence from us. We are cloath'd with <HI>fil|thy Garments</HI> (as <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was after the return from <HI>Babylon</HI>) and <HI>Satan is ready to re&s;i&s;t us</HI>; objecting that &s;uch contemptible Per&s;ons as we are, are utterly unfit to be improved in God's Service.

<P>It is not in vain to Supplicate to the Lord for the&s;e Favours; that the ri&s;ing Generation and tho&s;e who &s;ucceed them may be privi|ledged with a &s;tanding and being planted within the pale of the Vi&s;ible Church and un|der the initiatory Seal of <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI>; that their Parents may be moved from the Love they bear to their Children, to bring them near unto God and to offer and dedicate them un|to the Lord in their <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI>; that they may enjoy the priviledge of <HI>Parental Chri&s;tian Nur|ture</HI> in the knowlege and fear of God, and an Education under an Orthodox and Learned and Pious Mini&s;try from their Youth until their riper Years, whereby they may be form|ed to be a Generation whom the Lord &s;hall take plea&s;ure in; of whom the Lord &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>This People have I formed for my &s;elf, they &s;hall &s;hew forth my Prai&s;e.</HI></P>
