<HEAD>A DEFENCE OF THE New-England CHARTERS.</HEAD>
<P>_THE general Name of <HI>New-England,</HI> includes in its common Acceptation the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay,</HI> the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> the Government of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> with <HI>Providence</HI> Plantations, and the Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> The Three former are Charter Govern|ments: The la&s;t, <HI>viz. New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> never had any peculiar Privileges, but is under the immediate and ab&s;olute Direction of the Crown. The <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> as it is the fir&s;t of all the Colonies in Extent of Terri|tory and Number of Inhabitants, was the fir&s;t incorpo|rated, having obtain'd their Charter from King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, in the Fourth Year of his Reign. The Colo|ny of <HI>Connecticut</HI> receiv'd theirs from King <HI>Charles</HI> the
<PB N="2" REF="002216_0005_0FDACFA99202BBA8">
Second in 1662, and the Fourteenth Year of his Reign. The Government of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> had theirs in the Year following. The&s;e Charters agreed in all the main Points, confirming to the Patentees their Title to the Soil, and giving them ample Privileges for the well ordering and governing the re&s;pective Plantations: They had Power to make a Common Seal; to plead and be impleaded; to call General A&s;&s;emblies; to make Laws, &s;o as they were not repugnant to the Laws of <HI>England</HI>; to a&s;&s;e&s;s the Freemen; to con&s;titute all Civil Officers; to array the Inhabitants in warlike Po&s;ture, and u&s;e the Martial Law, when Occa&s;ion re|quir'd. And it was provided further, That in ca&s;e a|ny Doubts &s;hould ari&s;e, the Charters &s;hould have the mo&s;t favourable Con&s;truction for the Benefit of the &s;e|veral Corporations.</P>
<P>INVITED and encourag'd by the&s;e Advantages, a con|&s;iderable Number of Per&s;ons di&s;&s;enting from the <HI>Di&s;ci|pline</HI> of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, tho' agreeing with it in <HI>Doctrine,</HI> remov'd into tho&s;e remote Regions, upon no other View than to enjoy the Liberty of their Con|&s;ciences without Hazard to them&s;elves, or Offence to others. Thus the Colonies went on increa&s;ing and flouri&s;hing, in &s;pite of all Difficulties, till the Year 1684, when the City of <HI>London</HI> lo&s;t its Charter, and mo&s;t of the other Corporations in <HI>England,</HI> influenced by Fear or Flattery, complimented King <HI>Charles</HI> with a Surrender of theirs. In this general Ruin of Char|ters at Home, it could not be expected that tho&s;e in <HI>America</HI> &s;hould e&s;cape. It was then that a <HI>Quo War|ranto</HI> was i&s;&s;u'd again&s;t the Governour and Company of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay,</HI> and &s;oon after a Judgment was given again&s;t them in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</HI> At the &s;ame Time Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;s,</HI> then the King's Gover|nour of <HI>New-England,</HI> did by Order from Court repair to <HI>Hartford,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> with arm'd At|tendants, and forcibly &s;eiz'd their Charter for the King. <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> finding there was no Remedy to
<PB N="3" REF="002216_0006_0FDACFAB12F83F38">
be had, made a Vertue of Nece&s;&s;ity, and peaceably re&s;ign'd theirs. But as &s;oon as the News arriv'd of the happy Revolution in <HI>England,</HI> the&s;e Two la&s;t mention'd Go|vernments re-a&s;&s;um'd their Charters, and put them|&s;elves under the old Form of Admini&s;tration, in which they have continu'd ever &s;ince. The Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> cautious of offending their Superiours at Home, and con&s;idering there was a Judgment again&s;t them in the Court of <HI>Chancery,</HI> tho' mo&s;t unfairly and illegally obtain'd, did not think it advi&s;eable to make this Step; but &s;ent Agents to Court to &s;upplicate, in a humble Manner the Re&s;toration of their Charter. To what Mi&s;management, or other Cau&s;e it was owing, that they did not obtain it, and that this Loyal Cor|poration was the only one either in <HI>Old</HI> or <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> that did not recover its lo&s;t Liberty under our late Glorious Deliverer King <HI>William,</HI> 'tis now too late, and therefore to no Purpo&s;e, to enquire. A new Char|ter was order'd, which the Province now has, and is not much more than the Shadow of the old One. For by the&s;e new Letters Patents, the Appointment of a Governour, Lieutenant-Governour, Secretary, and all the Officers of the Admiralty, is ve&s;ted in the Crown. The Power of the Militia is wholly in the Hands of His Maje&s;ty's Governour, as Captain-General. All Judges, Ju&s;tices, and Sheriffs, to whom the Execution of the Laws is intru&s;ted, are nominated by the Gover|nour, with the Advice of His Maje&s;ty's Council. The Governour has a Negative upon the Choice of Council|lors, which is both <HI>peremptory</HI> and <HI>unlimited:</HI> He is neither oblig'd to render a Rea&s;on, nor re&s;train'd to a|ny Number. All Laws enacted by the General A&s;&s;em|bly are to be &s;ent Home for the Royal Approbation or Di&s;allowance. There is, be&s;ides, one very comprehen|&s;ive Article in&s;erted in this Charter, that no Laws, Or|dinances, Elections, or Acts of Government what&s;o|ever, &s;hall be of any Validity, without the Con&s;ent of the King's Governour &s;ignify'd in Writing.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002216_0007_0FDACFAC91D6CD90">BY the&s;e Re&s;ervations, the Prerogative of the Crown, and the Dependance of the Province thereon are in the mo&s;t effectual Manner &s;ecur'd, if there had been any Danger before, as I hope in the Sequel of this Di&s;|cour&s;e, to demon&s;trate there was not. And yet it hap|pens unaccountably that this Charter of King <HI>William,</HI> &s;o limited and re&s;trained, is as obnoxious as either of the other which have their full and entire Force. Ac|cordingly when about Six Years &s;ince a Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, and twice read, for regu|lating the Charter and Proprietary Governments, This was one among the re&s;t, and the fir&s;t nam'd in the Bill. And tho' the Honourable Hou&s;e thought fit, upon hear|ing the Petitions pre&s;ented to them on that Occa&s;ion, to drop their Proceedings, there is Rea&s;on to believe they may at another time re&s;ume them. It is in this View, that I have put together my Thoughts on the Subject, which for Methods &s;ake I have di&s;pos'd under the following Heads:</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how, that the Charter Go|vernments have a good and undoubted Right to their re&s;pective Charters.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> That they have not forfeited them by any Mi&s;|government or Male-Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> That if they had, it would not be the Intere&s;t of the Crown to accept the Forfeitures. And,</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> I &s;hall make &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon the ex|traordinary Method of Proceeding again&s;t the Char|ters by a Bill in Parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1&s;t. Propo&s;ition,</HI> That the Charter Govern|ments have a good and undoubted Right to their re&s;pective Char|ters.</NOTE>As to the fir&s;t Point there can be no Difficulty. The Charters were Granted by the Crown, and the King is acknowledg'd to be the Head and Fountain of all Corporations and Franchi&s;es. For tho' my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> takes notice, That a Body Po|litick may be e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Pre&s;cription, yet &s;uch Pre|&s;cription
<PB N="5" REF="002216_0008_0FDACFAE11FCD008">
is only valid upon a Pre&s;umption that there was an Ancient Grant of the Crown, which by the In|jury of Time was afterwards lo&s;t. I need not in&s;i&s;t upon what no Body controverts; but it is material to ob&s;erve, that the <HI>American</HI> Charters are of a higher Nature, and &s;tand on a better Foot, than the Corpora|tions in <HI>England.</HI> For the&s;e latter were granted upon Improvements already made, and therefore were Acts or meer Grace and Favour in the Crown; whereas the former were given as Praemiums for Services to be per|form'd, and therefore are to be con&s;ider'd as Grants upon a <HI>valuable Con&s;ideration</HI>; which adds Weight and Strength to the Title.</P>
<P>To increa&s;e the Nation's Commerce and enlarge her Dominions, mu&s;t be allow'd a Work of no little Merit, if we con&s;ider the Hard&s;hips to which the Adventurers were expo&s;ed; or the Expence in making their Settle|ments; or la&s;tly, the great Advantages thence accruing to the Crown and Nation. It would be an endle&s;s Task to recount all the Di&s;appointments, and Di&s;a&s;ters that befel the fir&s;t Planters in the&s;e Enterprizes. I &s;hall therefore only &s;ay in General, that after many Dangers in their Voyages over the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> which was not &s;uch an ea&s;y Navigation a Hundred Years ago as it is now, they arriv'd at an Inho&s;pitable Shore and a wa&s;te Wilderne&s;s, where there were few of the Ne|ce&s;&s;aries, and not one Accommodation of Life; where the Climate was &s;o extreme, the Summer Heats &s;o &s;corching, and the Winters &s;o long and &s;o cold, that the Countrey &s;eem'd &s;carcely habitable; and to &s;um up their Misfortunes, they found them&s;elves inevitably engag'd in a War with the Natives. So that by Fatigue and Famine, by the Extremity of the Sea&s;ons, and by a War with the Savages, the fir&s;t Planters &s;oon found their Graves, leaving the young Settlements to be per|fected by their Survivors.</P>
<P>To omit all this, I &s;hall only be particular in the Expence, which was above 200,000 <HI>l.</HI> in &s;etling the &s;ingle Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay.</HI> The Account
<PB N="6" REF="002216_0009_0FDACFAF9232FB38">
&s;tands thus: The Freight of the Pa&s;&s;engers co&s;t 95000 <HI>l.</HI> The Tran&s;portation of their fir&s;t Stock of Cattle came to 12000 <HI>l.</HI> The Provi&s;ions laid in for Sub&s;i&s;tance, till by Tillage more could be rais'd, co&s;t 45000 <HI>l.</HI> The Materials for Building their fir&s;t little Cottages came to 18000 <HI>l.</HI> Their Arms and Ammunition co&s;t 22000<HI>l.</HI> The&s;e &s;everal Articles amount to 192000 <HI>l.</HI> not taking into the Account the very great Sums which were ex|pended in Things of private U&s;e, that People could not be without, who were going to po&s;&s;e&s;s an uninha|bited Land. I mu&s;t add, that 192 Ships were employ'd in making this great Plantation, and Twelve Years were &s;pent before it was brought to any tolerable Degree of Perfection.</P>
<P>As great, however, as this Expence was, I believe it will appear that the Settlement of <HI>New-England</HI> was not more chargeable to the Adventurers, than it has bin in its Con&s;equence profitable to <HI>Great Britain.</HI> There is no &s;ort of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture, but what the Subjects there demand in a greater or le&s;s Proportion, as they have Ability to pay for it; every Thing for the U&s;e, Convenience, Ornament, and (I &s;ay it with regret) for the Luxury and Pride of Life. Some of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t experienc'd Traders to tho&s;e Parts have by Com|putation made the&s;e Exports ari&s;e to the Value of 300000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI> The Imports from thence are equally beneficial to the Kingdom. They brought home Bullion as long as they had any left; and now they are &s;o exhau&s;ted they can no longer &s;end it directly, they con|tinue to remit it by the Way of <HI>Stain, Portugal</HI> and the <HI>Streights</HI>; It is there they &s;ell their Fi&s;h, and the Produce of it comes hither in Gold and Silver, or Bills of Exchange, which is the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>OTHER and better Returns than Money it &s;elf they make in Ma&s;ts, the faire&s;t and large&s;t in the whole World, be&s;ides Pitch, Tarr, Turpentine, Ro&s;in, Plank, Knees for Ships, and other Species of Timber for various U&s;es. The&s;e, e&s;pecially Pitch and Tar, were formerly pur|chas'd of the <HI>Swede</HI> with Crown Pieces at intollerable
<PB N="7" REF="002216_0010_0FDACFB1FAFE2C40">
Prices; but &s;ince the Encourgement given for their Importation from <HI>New-England,</HI> they have fallen to half the Value. It is to be farther con&s;ider'd, that what we take of the&s;e Commodities from our own Plantati|ons, is brought Home in our own Ships, and paid for with our Manufactures.</P>
<P><HI>New England</HI> al&s;o imports Logwood for the dying our Woollen Goods in Quantites &s;ufficient for our own U&s;e, and a Surplus with which we furni&s;h <HI>Holland, Hambro',</HI> and other Markets in <HI>Europe.</HI> It is wholly owing to the Indu&s;try of the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> that this u&s;eful Commodity is reduc'd from 30 and 40<HI>l. per</HI> Ton, which we us'd to pay for it to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> to 12 <HI>l. per</HI> Ton, which is the pre&s;ent Price, and out of this 12 <HI>l.</HI> there is 4 <HI>l.</HI> 5 <HI>s.</HI> 0 <HI>d.</HI> paid to the Crown for Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>OTHER Articles might be mention'd, as Whale-Oil and Finns, which are yearly imported from <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> in no contemptible Quantities. They are u&s;eful in &s;everal Manufactures; and if nor had from thence mu&s;t have been purchas'd of the <HI>Dutch</HI> with ready Mo|ney and at exce&s;&s;ive Prices.</P>
<P>'TIS true, <HI>New England,</HI> makes no Sugar, but it a&s;|&s;i&s;ts the I&s;lands that do; without which A&s;&s;i&s;tance they could not make it, at lea&s;t not cheap enough, and in &s;ufficient Quantities to an&s;wer the Markets in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> For if the Sugar I&s;lands were oblig'd to &s;ow Wheat, and plant as much <HI>Indian</HI> Corn as they wanted, they mu&s;t needs plant the fewer Canes, and by con&s;e|quence make the le&s;s Sugar. From thence they are al&s;o &s;upply'd with Hor&s;es for their Mills, Timber for their Sugar Works, Staves for their Cask, and what is more con&s;iderable, with Barrel Pork, Mackrel, and refu&s;e Cod-Fi&s;h for their Negroes, without which their Labour would yield nothing to their Owners. For were they to feed their Slaves with Beef and other Provi&s;ions from <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Expence of a Plantation would devour the whole Produce of it. There are now &s;uch great Quantities of Sugar made in
<PB N="8" REF="002216_0011_0FDACFB354783818">
the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Plantations, and &s;o much import|ed from <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> that our Sugar I&s;lands need all Advantages to make this Commodity cheap and in Plenty, that we may be able to out-do, or at lea&s;t equal our Neighbours in the foreign Markets.</P>
<P>IT may be added, that <HI>New-England</HI> is a good Nur&s;e|ry of Seamen for the Navy. I believe I may affirm, that there was hardly a Ship, during the la&s;t War, in the Royal Navy without &s;ome of <HI>their</HI> Sailors on Board, which &s;o di&s;tre&s;s'd the <HI>New England</HI> Merchants, that they were oblig'd to man their Ships with <HI>Indians</HI> and Negroes.</P>
<P>WHAT I have &s;aid amounts to this: THAT <HI>New-England</HI> receiv'd her Charters on this expre&s;s Conditi|on, of &s;ettling Colonies for the Benefit of the Crown:</P>
<P>THAT &s;he was at a va&s;t Expence, and through in|credible Difficulties accompli&s;h'd the Work even be|yond what was ever hop'd or expected.</P>
<P>AND then the Conclu&s;ion, that I would draw from the&s;e Ptemi&s;es is this, THAT to &s;trip the Country of their Charters after the Service has been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful|ly perform'd, is abhorrent from all Rea&s;on, Equity and Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BUT it is urg'd, <HI>That the Crown does not take back the Soil, though it does the Charters</HI>; which indeed is &s;aying very little or nothing The Crown, &s;trictly &s;peaking, neither did nor could grant the Soil, having no Right in it &s;elf. Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> gave out the fir&s;t Patent to Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> in 1584; and if &s;he had any Right, what was it and whence deriv'd? It was not a <HI>Right of Inheritance,</HI> becau&s;e tho&s;e Countries did not de&s;cend to her from her Ance&s;tors. Not of <HI>Con|quest,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he neither conquer'd, nor attempted to conquer them. Be&s;ides, it would be pretty hard to conceive how a Conque&s;t, where there was no preceed|ing Injury or Provocation, could create a Right. Nor did it ari&s;e by <HI>Purcha&s;e,</HI> there being no Money or other valuable Con&s;ideration paid. Nor could &s;he claim by
<PB N="9" REF="002216_0012_0FDACFB4D1DA86B0">
the <HI>prior Di&s;covery or Pre-occupancy,</HI> as the Civilians &s;peak, becau&s;e that gives a Right only to <HI>derelict Lands,</HI> which the&s;e were not, being full of Inhabitants, who undoubtedly had as good a Title to their own Country, as the <HI>Europeans</HI> have to theirs. And &s;ure no Body will &s;ay in plain Terms, that we have any Claim upon the Foot that we were <HI>Christians,</HI> and they <HI>Heathen</HI>; which yet I know &s;ome Per&s;ons of no ob&s;cure Fame have tacitly &s;ugge&s;ted. <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf, as imperious as &s;he is, never carry'd her Pretences to this Height: For though &s;ome of her Doctors have taught, ab&s;urdly enough&punc; that <HI>Dominion</HI> is founded in Grace, none of 'em ever &s;aid that <HI>Property</HI> was. There remains then no other Right than what is deriv'd from the native Lords of the Soil, and that is what the hone&s;t <HI>New-England</HI> Planters rely on, having purchas'd it with their Mo|ney. The <HI>Indian Title</HI> therefore, as it is decry'd and undervalu'd here, &s;eems the only fair and ju&s;t one; and neither Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> by <HI>her</HI> Patents, or King <HI>James</HI> by <HI>his</HI> afterwards, could give any more than a bare <HI>Right of Preemption.</HI></P>
<P>AND yet admitting that the Crown granted the Soil, to how little mu&s;t the Value of &s;uch Grants amount, all Circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd? The Patentees were not only oblig'd to travel a Thou&s;and Leagues beyond Sea, but to purcha&s;e the Grants over again of the Natives, before they could be put into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Land it &s;elf was of a rough &s;avage Nature, incumber'd with unprofitable Woods, and of no U&s;e till by va&s;t Labour and Expence &s;ubdu'd and cultivated. For to &s;peak the Truth, tho&s;e Parts were but <HI>bare Creation</HI> to the fir&s;t Planters, and their Labour <HI>like the Beginning the World.</HI></P>
<P>So that which Way &s;oever we take it, I think it's plain, if the Crown re&s;umes the Charters, it will take away the Whole it gave, and deprive the Patentees of the only Recompence they were to have for all their Toils and Fatigues, which they thought to have con|veyed &s;afe to their Po&s;terity. Could they have ima|gin'd this, could they have fore&s;een that their Privi|leges
<PB N="10" REF="002216_0013_0FDACFB651F51778">
were &s;uch <HI>tran&s;itory things,</HI> as to la&s;t no longer than their Work &s;hould be done, and their &s;ettlements compleated, they had never engag'd in &s;o hazardous and difficult an Enterprize. They would never have parted from their Native Land being neither Crimi|nals nor Nece&s;&s;itous; and tho&s;e Countries which have &s;ince added &s;o much to the Wealth and Greatne&s;s of the Crown, might have been a barren Wilderne&s;s to this Day; or what is wor&s;e, and more probable, might have bin fill'd with <HI>French</HI> Colonies, whereby <HI>France</HI> would have reign'd &s;ole Mi&s;tre&s;s of <HI>North America.</HI></P>
<P>I believe it will be generally allow'd, that my Ar|gument is thus far right, if I can make good my &s;econd Propo&s;ition, <HI>VIZ.</HI></P>

<P>SOME of the able&s;t Common Lawyers that <HI>England</HI> could ever boa&s;t of, have maintain'd that a Corporation, being an <HI>Ens Rationis,</HI> is in it's Nature indi&s;&s;olvable, and that therefore no Abu&s;e of it's Franchi&s;es can effect it in point of Forfeiture, or determine its Being. If this Argument &s;hould be thought too &s;ubtle and meta|phy&s;ical, I hope however it will be allow'd an Extreme on the other &s;ide, that a Corporation &s;hould be threaten'd for <HI>every</HI> Offence to be &s;eiz'd into the King's Hands. The Subjects Abroad claim the Privilege of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> which &s;ays that no Man &s;hall be fin'd above the Nature of his Offence, and whatever his Mi&s;carriage be, a <HI>Salvo Contenemento &s;uo</HI> is to be ob&s;erv'd by the Judge. If therefore they have committed Faults, let them be <HI>cha&s;tiz'd,</HI> not <HI>de&s;troy'd,</HI> let not their Corpora|tions be di&s;&s;olv'd for any other Crime than a Failure of their Allegiance. But I need not go into this or any other nice Point of Law, it being &s;ufficient to &s;how that the Charter Governments are clear of the &s;everal Facts
<PB N="11" REF="002216_0014_0FDACFB7D5F49718">
which have been objected again&s;t them, and a&s;&s;ign'd as matter of Forfeiture. In the Bill that was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, there were two Allegations again&s;t the Charter and Proprietary Governments, which I &s;hall fir&s;t an&s;wer, and then go on to con&s;ider &s;uch other Complaints as I have met with from Time to Time again&s;t the&s;e Governments.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Charge in the Bill again&s;t the Charter Governments is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>1</HI>&s;t Charge again&s;t the Charter Governments, that they have neglect|ed the Defence of the Inhabitants, <HI>an&s;wered.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>they have neglected the Defence of the Inhabi|tants.</HI> This I mu&s;t own, if true, and &s;uch Neglect was voluntary, while they had the Means and Power of De|fence in their Hands, was a high and trea&s;onable Breach of their Tru&s;t and would be the &s;tronge&s;t Argument that could be brought for a Re&s;ump|tion of the Charters. But now, if I &s;hall prove that the&s;e Governments, e&s;pecially the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> and <HI>Connecticut,</HI> have in all pa&s;t Times defended the Inha|bitants both by Sea and Land, as well again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> as <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy: If I &s;hall prove that they have all the late War protected one of the <HI>King's Provinces</HI> lying on their Confines, which would otherwi&s;e inevitably have bin lo&s;t; and that <HI>another</HI> of the&s;e Provinces took no Part in the War, but maintain'd a &s;hameful Neu|trality with the Enemy, whereby the whole Weight of the War fell on the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI>; If I &s;hall prove that they have frequently carry'd offen&s;ive Arms into the <HI>French</HI> Territories, and made one important Con|que&s;t, &s;ince annex'd to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown; and that all this was done at their own va&s;t Expence; then, I hope, <HI>New-England</HI> will &s;tand fairly acquitted of this &s;uppos'd Crime of <HI>Neglecting to defend the Inhabitants,</HI> and be al|low'd not only irreprehen&s;ible in this re&s;pect, but to have highly merited of the Crown and Nation.</P>
<P>THESE FACTS are &s;o certain and &s;o well known, that I'm per&s;waded this had never bin a&s;&s;ign'd as a Rea&s;on for di&s;&s;olving the Charters&punc; but with a &s;pecial View to <HI>Carolina,</HI> which, when this Bill was brought into the
<PB N="12" REF="002216_0015_0FDACFB9550BB9D0">
Hou&s;e, was reduc'd to extremity by a War with the <HI>Spani&s;h Indians</HI>; and being neither able to defend them|&s;elves, nor obtain Succours from their Lords Proprie|tors, addre&s;s'd the Crown to take them under its Protection. It was therefore natural enough to mention this in the Bill; though with humble Submi&s;&s;ion, it being the &s;ingle Ca&s;e of one Proprietary Colony, it &s;hould in all Rea&s;on have bin re&s;train'd to that, and not extended to the Charter Provinces, which are neither alike con&s;tituted, nor were in the &s;ame Di&s;tre&s;s. For <HI>New-England,</HI> as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;how, has defended it &s;elf from the fir&s;t Beginning to this Day without being burden&s;ome to the Crown, though not without great Struggles and Difficulties.</P>
<P>'TIS TRUE, they did not commence Ho&s;tilities, nor even take up Arms of Defence, till they found by Experience that no other Means would prevail. The fir&s;t Planters, far from u&s;ing the barbarous Methods practis'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the <HI>Southern</HI> Continent, which have made them dete&s;table to the whole Chri&s;tian World, &s;ought to gain the Natives by &s;trict Ju&s;tice in their Dealings with them, as well as by all the En|dearments of Kindne&s;s and Humanity. To lay an ear|ly Foundation for a firm and la&s;ting Friend&s;hip, they a&s;&s;ur'd the <HI>Americans,</HI> that they did not come among them as Invaders but Purcha&s;ers, and therefore call'd an A&s;&s;embly of them together, to enquire who had the Right to di&s;po&s;e of their Lands; and being told it was their <HI>Sachems</HI> or Princes, they thereupon agreed with them for what Di&s;tricts they bought, publickly and in open Market. If they did not pay a great Price for their Purcha&s;es yet they paid as much as they were worth. For it mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd, that Land was of little U&s;e to the Natives, and therefore but of little Value. They liv'd chiefly on Fi&s;h and Fowl, and Hunt|ing, becau&s;e they would not be at the Pains to clear and break up the Ground. And as for their Meadows and Mar&s;hes, they were of no U&s;e at all, for want of neat Cattle to feed them, of which there were none in tho&s;e Parts of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002216_0016_0FDACFBB27237478">THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had no &s;ooner made &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ion for them&s;elves, than they apply'd their Cares for the Benefit of the <HI>Indians,</HI> by endeavouring to bring them from their wild manner of Life to the civil and polite Cu&s;toms of <HI>Europe.</HI> For this purpo&s;e, they mark'd out Land to build <HI>Indian</HI> Towns, &s;upply'd them with all proper Uten&s;ils for Building, pre&s;crib'd to them forms of Government, and above all, omitted no Pains to bring them acquainted with the Go&s;pel. After &s;ome Time, when it was found nece&s;&s;ary, the Colony made a Law to forbid any Per&s;on's purcha&s;ing Land of the <HI>Indians</HI> without the Approbation of the General Court, to prevent their being over-reach'd or ill us'd in their private Bargains: and &s;ome Land, ly|ing very convenient for them, was by another law made inalienable, and never to be purcha&s;ed out of their Hands, than which nothing could more demon|&s;trate the Colony's Care and Concern for the Natives.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT my &s;elf oblig'd to make this Preface to the main Argument, that I might wipe off an unworthy A&s;per&s;ion that has been ca&s;t on the fir&s;t Setlers of <HI>New-England,</HI> that they never treated the Savages well, but en|croach'd on their Land by Degrees, till they fraudulently and forcibly turn'd them out of all. It was far otherwi&s;e, as I have &s;hown; yet nothing could oblige the <HI>Indians</HI> to Peace and Friend&s;hip. They were alarm'd with the &s;trong Jealou&s;ies of the growing Power of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and therefore began a War with a Re&s;olution to extirpate them, before they had too well e&s;tabli&s;h'd them&s;elves. Yet as terrible as this Pro&s;pect was to Two or Three young Colonies, who had work enough to defend them|&s;elves again&s;t Famine, which in a cold barren Country &s;urrounded with Enemies &s;tar'd them in the Face, they neverthele&s;s made no Application to the Crown for A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, but drew up Articles of Confederacy among them&s;elves, by the Name of the <HI>United Colonies of</HI> New-England, for their mutual Defence. This done, they took the Number of all the Males in the &s;everal Plantations, and rai&s;ing a Poll Tax according to each
<PB N="14" REF="002216_0017_0FDACFBC51B81648">
Per&s;on's re&s;pective Ability, they with one Con&s;ent laid a&s;ide their Plough&s;hares and Pruning Hooks for the Sword and the Spear, and under the Command of Major-Generals, whom they cho&s;e after the manner then in <HI>England,</HI> march'd directly to the Enemy's Head-Quarters, and &s;tronge&s;t Fortifications, from whence they drove them with great Precipitation. Nor did they &s;top there, but pur&s;u'd them through all their Rece&s;&s;es, 'till they oblig'd them to enter into a &s;olemn Treaty of Peace. Such however was the perfidious Nature of the <HI>American</HI> Savages, that they &s;oon renew'd the Ho&s;tilities, tho' to their own fatal Co&s;t. For if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> experienc'd a Variety of Fortune, as could not but be expected in the Vici&s;&s;itudes of War, yet they were for the mo&s;t part victorious, and in the Cour&s;e of &s;ome Years, after many terrible Slaughters of the Enemy, &s;ubdu'd and utterly extirpated Seven or Eight fierce and populous Nations.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible &s;ome have endeavour'd to depreciate the&s;e Conque&s;ts, as gain'd over a rude barbarous people unexercis'd to Arms; which if granted, &s;till it can't be &s;aid, that <HI>the Defence of the Inhabitants was neglected</HI>; and therefore the Charter Governments can fall under no Cen&s;ure, if they &s;hould be thought to have merited no Prai&s;e. But if it be con&s;ider'd, that the <HI>New-England</HI> Forces contended with Enemies bloody in their Nature and &s;uperiour in Number; that they attack'd them in deep Mora&s;&s;es, defended with Fortifications &s;ufficiently &s;trong, tho' not regular; and that the A&s;&s;ai|lants were not provided with Canon, nor could approach by Trenches, but advanc'd on level Ground: And if to this be added the va&s;t Fatigues of their Campaigns, where Officers and Soldiers lay on the Snow without any Shelter over their Heads in the mo&s;t rigorous Win|ters; I &s;ay, if a ju&s;t Con&s;ideration be had of the&s;e Things, Envy it &s;elf mu&s;t acknowledge that their En|terprizes were hardy, and their Succe&s;&s;es glorious. And tho' the brave Commanders who led on the&s;e Troops, and mo&s;t of them died in the Bed of Honour, mu&s;t not

&s;hine in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Annals, yet their Memory ought to be &s;acred in their own Country, and there at lea&s;t be tran&s;mitted to the late&s;t Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE inland Parts being now at re&s;t, the War was remov'd to the Frontiers, which were cruelly harra&s;s'd by other <HI>Indian Tribes,</HI> animated and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> who have given the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> but few Intervals of Peace, and tho&s;e very &s;hort ones from that Time to this Day. All this while THAT Go|vernment was never wanting to protect the King's Subjects within their Juri&s;diction, even in the remote&s;t Parts of it. They kept Troops on foot, no le&s;s than Six or Seven Hundred at a Time, to cover the Barrier Line, and built Forts wherever they were nece&s;&s;ary; one of them nam'd <HI>William-Henry,</HI> but commonly call'd <HI>Pemaquid</HI> Fort, becau&s;e built on a River of that Name, was in the Heart of the Enemy's Country, and de&s;erves a particular De&s;cription. It was built of Stone in a quadrangular Figure, 737 Foot in Circumference, with|out the outer Wall, and 108 Foot &s;quare within the inner ones. It had 28 Ports, and 18 Guns mounted, 6 being 18 Pounders. The Wall on the South Line fronting to the Sea was 22 Foot high, and above 6 Foot thick at the Ports, which were 8 Foot from the Ground. The round Tower at the We&s;t End of this Line, was 29 Foot high: The Wall on the Ea&s;t Line was 12 Foot high, on the North 10, and on the We&s;t 18. It &s;tood 20 Rod from High-Water Mark, and was garri&s;on'd with 60 and &s;ometimes 100 Men. The Expence in building and maintaining this Garri&s;on was con&s;idera|ble, yet the Province chearfully &s;ubmitted to it; nor did they decline rebuilding it, after it was &s;urpriz'd and demoli&s;h'd by the <HI>French,</HI> for any other rea&s;on, but that it was found by Experience, the Enemy could come many Miles wide of it, and attack their Frontiers. They therefore built Forts at <HI>Saco</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> and other Places mo&s;t expos'd which an&s;wer'd the &s;ame End.</P>
<P>BY this Care the Power of the Enemy was very much broke, and the King's Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="002216_0019_0FDACFBF60746150">
from whence the Royal Navy is annually &s;upply'd with Ma&s;ts, has been pre&s;erv'd, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have unavoidably been lo&s;t, being unable to help it &s;elf, and receiving no Succours from Home. <HI>New-York,</HI> a|nother of the King's Provinces, has always kept it &s;elf in a State of Neutrality, contributing nothing to the common Safety, whil&s;t the <HI>Canada Indians,</HI> join'd by Parties of the <HI>French,</HI> us'd to make their <HI>Route</HI> by their Borders without mole&s;ting them, and fall upon the Out Towns of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets.</HI> This Behaviour was the more unpardonable in that Government, becau&s;e they have 400 regular Troops maintain'd among them at the King's Charge, and have the five Nations of the <HI>Iroquoi&s;e</HI> on their Confines, who are entirely depen|dent on them, and might ea&s;ily, had they bin engag'd in the common Cau&s;e, at all Times have intercepted the Enemy in their Marches, and thereby have preven|ted the Depredations committed on his Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects. Solemn and repeated Applications were made to the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> by the Governours of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, Connecticut,</HI> and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> in joint Letters on this Subject, but in vain. The An&s;wer was they could not think it proper to engage their <HI>Indians</HI> in an actual War, le&s;t they &s;hould endanger their own Frontiers, and bring upon them&s;elves an Expence which they were in no Condition to provide for. And thus the poor Charter Colonies were left to bear the whole Burden, and do all the Work them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay</HI> has been equal|ly &s;ollicitous to protect their Inhabitants by Sea, a|gain&s;t any Foreign Inva&s;ion. For this End they have kept their Militia well train'd and di&s;ciplin'd and by an Act of the A&s;&s;embly oblig'd all Per&s;ons, under pro|per Penalties, to be well provided with Ammunition and Arms, that they might be ready in ca&s;e of a &s;ud|den De&s;cent from Abroad. <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which is their Ca|pital Town, and principal Sea-port, is fortify'd with Two Batteries to the Sea, one at each End of the Town; and about a League from it, at the Entrance of the
<PB N="17" REF="002216_0020_0FDAC8E0B3FF4780">
Harbour, there is a &s;trong beautiful Ca&s;tle, which is by far the fine&s;t Piece of military Architecture in the <HI>Briti&s;h America.</HI> It was built by Colonel <HI>Romer,</HI> a famous <HI>German</HI> Engineer, at the Countries Expence, and is call'd <HI>Ca&s;tle William.</HI> It is a <HI>Quarre</HI> &s;urrounded with a cover'd Way, and join'd with two Lines of Commu|nication from the main Battery, as al&s;o a Line of Com|munication from the main Gate to a Redoubt, which is to prevent the Landing. It is well &s;ituated near the Channel, to hinder Ships from coming up to the Town, which mu&s;t all come within Pi&s;tol &s;hot of this Battery. It is mounted with 100 Pieces of Cannon, &s;everal of which are plac'd on a Platform, near High-water Mark, &s;o as to rake a Ship fore and aft, before &s;he can bring her Broad&s;ides to bear again&s;t the Ca&s;tle, and &s;ome of the&s;e Cannon carry 42 Pounders. In Peace there is an independent Company of 50 or 100 Men, I'm not cer|tain which, that con&s;tantly are on Duty; but in time of War 500 able Men are exempted from all other military Duty, to attend the Service of the Ca&s;tle at an Hours Warning, upon any Signal given of the Ap|proach of an Enemy. To prevent the Ca&s;tle's being &s;urpriz'd, there's a Light-Hou&s;e built on a Rock appear|ing above Water two Leagues from the Town, which makes a Signal to the Ca&s;tle of the Appearance of any Ships and their Number. The Ca&s;tle again warns the Town, and if there be 5 Ships or more in time of War, an Alarm is given to all the adjacent Countries by firing a Beacon. The Province has al&s;o a Galley or Frigate well man'd in time of War, to guard the Coa&s;t from Privateers, and to convoy their Home Trade. In &s;hort, nothing that could be done for Defence of the Subject by Sea or Land, has bin left undone. It is really a&s;to|ni&s;hing to con&s;ider, and difficult to believe, that the&s;e little Governments &s;hould be able by their own Strength, and at their own Charge, to perform &s;uch great Things.</P>
<P>AND YET this is not all that mu&s;t be &s;aid in their Defence. For as I have before ob&s;erv'd, they have
<PB N="18" REF="002216_0021_0FDACFC252D95910">
di&s;cover'd a noble Zeal to enlarge the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire, by undertaking &s;everal chargeable Expeditions again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>French</HI> Settlements in <HI>America.</HI> In the Year 1690 they made an Armament again&s;t <HI>Fort Royal,</HI> which was a Ne&s;t of Privateers, and a <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the <HI>American</HI> Trade; be&s;ides that it was the Head Quarter, from whence Parties of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> i&s;&s;ued out, and fell upon the Ea&s;tern Parts of <HI>New-England.</HI> They made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Place with all the Country of <HI>Accadie,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI> who com|manded in chief, admini&s;ter'd to the Inhabitants an Oath of Allegiance to the Crown of <HI>England</HI>; in which State that Country remain'd till the Peace of <HI>Ry&s;wick</HI>&punc; when it was deliver'd up to the <HI>French.</HI> The great Service done the Crown by this Acqui&s;ition, is now too well known to need being particularly mention'd.</P>
<P>THE <HI>New-Englanders</HI> being willing to pur&s;ue this good Succe&s;s, made an Attempt again&s;t <HI>Canada</HI> the &s;ame Year, with a Fleet of 32 Sail of Ve&s;&s;els, be&s;ides Ten|ders, having on Board 2000 Men, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time a little Army of 1000 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and 1500 <HI>Indians</HI> were to march by Land and attack <HI>Mont-Real.</HI> 'Tis true, they fatally mi&s;carry'd, (and who can an&s;wer for the Fortune of War?) But this ought not to le&s;&s;en the Merit of an Enterprize, which they &s;o well intended, and by which they &s;o greatly &s;uffer'd. It co&s;t 150,000 <HI>l.</HI> in Money, and what was infinitely more valuable, the Lives of 1000 Men. Nor were the&s;e Vagrants, &s;uch as are pickt up here in the Streets, and di&s;orderly Hou&s;es, and thence pre&s;s'd into the War, but Heads of Families, Artificers, and robu&s;t young Men, &s;uch as no Country can &s;pare, and lea&s;t of all New Settlements, where Labour is the deare&s;t Thing in the World, becau&s;e no|thing &s;o much wanted as Hands. They did not indeed fall by the Sword of the Enemy, if that could alle|viate their Misfortune, but by a Camp Fever, by Fa|mine, and various Di&s;a&s;ters in their return Home, oc|ca&s;ion'd chiefly by the early Approach of a &s;evere Win|ter which made it impracticable for Provi&s;ions to fol|low them.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="002216_0022_0FDACFC3D40415A0">GREAT was the di&s;tre&s;s to which the&s;e poor Colo|nies were reduc'd by this expen&s;ive and impro&s;perous Expedition; yet by the wi&s;e Conduct of the Govern|ments, and the Indu&s;try of the People, they &s;o well recover'd them&s;elves in le&s;s than 20 Years, as to re&s;olve upon making another Vi&s;it to their <HI>French</HI> Neighbours, whom they &s;aw daily growing in Power, and threat|ning in time to de&s;troy all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlements. But not thinking them&s;elves &s;trong enough to deal with <HI>Quebeck,</HI> they were content to make only an Attempt on <HI>Port Royal,</HI> which was done accordingly, tho' not with the former Succe&s;s, the <HI>French</HI> Fort being now &s;trong and regular, and well provided for a Defence or Siege.</P>
<P>NOT di&s;courag'd by this Repetition of Misfortunes, when the late Queen &s;ignify'd to the&s;e Governments, her Royal Intention to reduce <HI>Canada,</HI> and requir'd them to provide their Quota of Troops; it can't be imagin'd with what Alacrity they came into it, and made in all Re&s;pects ample Provi&s;ion for it.

<P>THE next Year they rais'd a Body of Troops again, which commanded by Colonel <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> with 500 Auxiliaries from hence, made another De&s;cent upon <HI>Port Royal</HI> and reduc'd it. For which Service they were promis'd by her then Maje&s;ty con&s;iderable Advan|tages in re&s;pect of Trade and the Fi&s;hery, to which it's hop'd a ju&s;t regard will be had, when <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> is brought under a Civil E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>ONE may imagine now that the&s;e Colonies were quite out of Breath, and needed a little Re&s;t.

<P>WHEN in the Year 1703, or about that Time, <HI>Ja|maica</HI> was in Fear of an Inva&s;ion, and de&s;ir'd &s;ome Help from the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI>; They, not|with&s;tanding the length of the Voyage, which is often 8 or 9 Weeks, &s;ent them two Companies of Foot, com|manded by Colonel <HI>Walton,</HI> and Captain <HI>Larimore,</HI> both very gallant Officers. The Companies arriv'd &s;afe, and &s;erv'd there two Years, &s;ometimes on Shore, and at other Times as Marines on Board the Man of War, then in the Service of the I&s;land; and I believe very few of the&s;e Soldiers ever returned to their Native Country.</P>

<P><PB N="21" REF="002216_0024_0FDACFC6D1E8D2D8">UPON the whole, what a va&s;t Fund of Merit have the Charter Governments rais'd to them&s;elves from a long Series of Faithful and Heroick Services!

<P>THE other Charge in the Bill is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>2</HI>d Charge in the Bill again&s;t the Charter Govern|ments, that they have exercis'd arbi|trary Power, <HI>an&s;|wer'd.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>That they have exercis'd arbitrary Power.</HI> If this be aim'd at the Pro|prietary Governments, which how|ever I don't accu&s;e, I have nothing to &s;ay, but am &s;ure that the Charter Governments &s;tand clear of it. The Thing &s;peaks loudly for it &s;elf. For in the Govern|ments, where there are Charters, and tho&s;e Charters entire, all Officers Civil and Military are elected by the People, and that anually; than which Con&s;titution nothing under Heaven can be a &s;tronger Barrier again&s;t arbitrary Rule. For &s;hould it be allow'd, that the Peo|ple, <HI>corrupted</HI> or <HI>deceiv'd,</HI> might in&s;tead of wi&s;e Ma|gi&s;trates chu&s;e Tyrants and Oppre&s;&s;ors to Lord over them one Year; yet it can't be imagin'd, that after they have felt the Smart of it, they will do &s;o the next. Nor can there be a greater Obligation on the Rulers them&s;elves to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice than that their Election depends on it the next Year. Hence the fre|quent Choice of Magi&s;trates has bin ever a main Pillar; upon which all who have aim'd at Freedom in their Schemes of Government, have depended.</P>
<P>As the Rea&s;on is inconte&s;tible, &s;o the Fact is appa|rent, that the&s;e Governments, far from retrenching the Liberty of the Subject, have improv'd it in &s;ome important Articles, which the Circum&s;tances of Things in <HI>Great Britain</HI> perhaps don't require, or won't ea&s;ily admit:</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002216_0025_0FDACFC852DD1230">To in&s;tance in a few; There has bin from the begin|ning an Office erected by Law in every Country, where all Conveyances of Land are enter'd at large, after the Grantors have fir&s;t acknowledg'd them before a Ju&s;tice of Peace; by which means much Fraud is prevented, no Per&s;on, being able to &s;ell his E&s;tate twice, or take up more Money upon it than it's worth. Provi&s;ion has likewi&s;e been made for the Security of the Life and Property of the Subject in the Matter of Juries, who are not return'd by the Sherriff of the County, but are cho&s;en by the Inhabitants of the Town a convenient Time before the &s;itting of the Courts. And this Election is under the mo&s;t exact Regulation, in Order to prevent Corruption, &s;o far as Humane Prudence can do it. It mu&s;t be noted, that Sherriffs in the Plantations are com|paratively but little Officers, and therefore not to be tru&s;ted as here, where they are Men of ample Fortunes. And yet even here &s;uch flagrant Corruptions have been found in returning Juries by Sherriffs, that the Hou&s;e of Commons thought it nece&s;&s;ary in their la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion to amend the Law in this Point, and pa&s;s'd a Bill for choo&s;ing them by Ballot.</P>
<P>REDRESS in their Courts of Law is <HI>ea&s;y, quick</HI> and <HI>cheap.</HI> All Proce&s;&s;es are in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and no &s;pecial Pleadings or Demurrers are admitted, but the general I&s;&s;ue is always given, and &s;pecial Matters brought in Evidence; which &s;aves Time and Expence; and in this Ca&s;e a Man is not liable to lo&s;e his E&s;tate for a Defect in Form, nor is the Merit of the Cau&s;e made to depend on the Niceties of Clerk&s;hip. By a Law of the Coun|try no Writ may be abated for a circum&s;tantial Error, &s;uch as a &s;light Mi&s;-nomer or any Informality. And by another Law, it is enacted, that every Attorney taking out a Writ from the Clerk's Office, &s;hall indor&s;e his Sirname upon it, and be liable to pay to the adver&s;e Party his Co&s;ts and Charges in Ca&s;e of Non-Pro&s;ecution or Di&s;continuance, or that the Plaintiff be Non-&s;uit, or Judgment pa&s;s again&s;t him. And it is provided in the &s;ame Act, That if the Plaintiff &s;hall &s;uffer a Non&s;uit
<PB N="23" REF="002216_0026_0FDACFC9D57583D8">
by the Attorney's mi&s;-laying the Action, he &s;hall be oblig'd to draw a new Writ without a Fee, in ca&s;e the Party &s;hall &s;ee fit to revive the Suit. I can't but think that every body, except Gentlemen of the long Robe and the Attornies, will think this a whole&s;ome Law, and well calculated for the Benefit of the Subject. For the quicker Di&s;patch of Cau&s;es, Declarations are made Parts of the Writ, in which the Ca&s;e is fully and par|ticularly &s;et forth. If it be matter of Account, the Account is annex'd to the Writ, and Copies of both left with the Defendant; which being done Fourteen Days before the Sitting of the Court, he is oblig'd to plead directly, and the I&s;&s;ue is then try'd. Whereas by the Practice of the Court of <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> Three or Four Months Time is often lo&s;t after the Writ is &s;erv'd, before the Cau&s;e can be brought to I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>NOR are the People of <HI>New-England</HI> oppre&s;s'd with the infinite Delays and Expence that attend the Proceed|ings in <HI>Chancery,</HI> where both Parties are often ruin'd by the Charge and Length of the Suit. But as in all other Countries, <HI>England,</HI> only excepted, <HI>Jus &amp; Aequum</HI> are held the &s;ame, and never divided; &s;o it is there: A Power of <HI>Chancery</HI> being ve&s;ted in the Judges of the Courts of Common Law as to &s;ome particular Ca&s;es, and they make equitable Con&s;tructions in Others. I mu&s;t add, that the Fees of Officers of all &s;orts are &s;etled by Acts of A&s;&s;embly at moderate Prices, for the Ea&s;e of the Subject.</P>
<P>IT were ea&s;y to mention other Articles, but that I per&s;wade my &s;elf it is needle&s;s. The Charter Govern|ments are celebrated for their excellent Laws and mild Admini&s;tration; for the Security of Liberty and Pro|perty; for the Encouragement of Vertue, and Sup|pre&s;&s;ion of Vice; for the promoting Letters, by erecting Free-Schools and Colleges; and in one Word, for every Thing that can make a People happy and pro&s;perous, To the&s;e Arts it is owing, that <HI>New-England,</HI> though &s;he has attain'd but little more than the Age of a Man, with all the Di&s;advantages under which &s;he labours in

re&s;pect to her Trade and Climate, and almo&s;t a perpetual <HI>Indian</HI> War, has hitherto flouri&s;h'd far above any other of the Plantations.</P>
<P>THIS being the Ca&s;e of the Charter Governments, let us turn the Tables, and &s;ee how it far'd with them when in an <HI>evil Reign</HI> they lo&s;t their Charters. Then the Governour or <HI>New-England</HI> with Four or Five Strangers of his Council, Men of de&s;perate Fortunes, and bad if any Principles, made what Laws, and levy'd what Taxes they pleas'd on the People. They with|out an A&s;&s;embly, rais'd a Penny in the Pound on all the E&s;tates in the Country, and another Penny on all im|ported Goods, be&s;ides Twenty Pence <HI>per</HI> Head as Poll Money, and an immoderate Exci&s;e on Wine, Rum, and other Liquors. Several worthy Per&s;ons, having in an humble Addre&s;s repre&s;ented this Proceeding as a Grie|vance, were committed to the common Goal for a High Mi&s;demanour; deny'd the Benefit of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act; try'd out of their own County; fin'd exorbi|tantly, and oblig'd to pay 160 <HI>l.</HI> for Fees, when the Pro&s;ecution would hardly have co&s;t them &s;o many Shillings in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And to compleat the Op|pre&s;&s;ion, when they upon their Tryal claim'd the Privileges of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> they were &s;coffingly told, <HI>Tho&s;e Things would not follow them to the Ends of the Earth.</HI> Unnatural In&s;ult; mu&s;t the brave Adventurer, who with the Hazard of his Life and Fortune, &s;eeks out new Climates to inrich his Mother Country, be deny'd tho&s;e common Rights, which his Countrymen enjoy at Home in Ea&s;e and Indolence? Is he to be made mi&s;erable, and a Slave by his own Acqui&s;itions? Is the Labourer alone unworthy of his Hire, and &s;hall they <HI>only</HI> reap, who have neither &s;ow'd nor planted? Mon&s;trous Ab&s;urdity! Horrid inverted Order!</P>
<P>THESE Proceedings, however Arbitrary and Oppre&s;|&s;ive, were but the Prelude: The Cata&s;trophe was, if po&s;&s;ible, yet more di&s;mal. Having invaded their Li|berties, by an ea&s;y Tran&s;ition the next Attack was di|rectly on their Properties. Their Title to their Lands
<PB N="25" REF="002216_0028_0FDACFCCE95C3220">
was ab&s;olutely deny'd by the Governour and his Crea|tures upon two pretences: One, that their Conveyances were not according to the Law of <HI>England</HI>; the Other, that if they might be thought to have had &s;omething like a Title formerly, yet it now ceas'd by the Revoca|tion of their Charters. So that they who had fairly purchas'd their Lands, and held them in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on for above Fifty Years, were now oblig'd to accept new Deeds from the Governour and pay for them a third Part of their Value, in order to a&s;certain their Titles or otherwi&s;e they would be &s;eized for the Crown.</P>
<P>IT would be an Injury to Vertue, if I did not in this Place pay di&s;tingui&s;h'd Honour to the Memory of an hone&s;t and worthy Patriot, Col. <HI>Shrimpton</HI> long &s;ince deceas'd, who being rich in Lands, was courted to re|ceive new Patents <HI>gratis,</HI> that others might be drawn in by the Authority of his Example; but when he was appriz'd of their De&s;ign, he cho&s;e rather to have his Lands &s;eiz'd (and they were &s;eiz'd) than by &s;uch a ba&s;e Complyance betray his Countrymen into the Snares prepar'd for them. I &s;hould not have thus far entred into the Detail of Things &s;o long pa&s;t, but to &s;how from Experience, as well as from the Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing, that Charters are not the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> of Arbitrary Government, but indeed <HI>strong Works</HI> rais'd again&s;t it, which once thrown down, Oppre&s;&s;ion ru&s;hes in like a Tide, and bears down every thing before it.</P>
<P>HAVING thus an&s;wer'd the Allegations of the Bill, in a Manner which I hope may be &s;atisfactory, I am next to con&s;ider &s;uch Arguments as I have met with in Conver&s;ation from Per&s;ons in the Mini&s;try and others.</P>
<P>WHAT I have heard mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Third Objec|tion, that the Acts of Trade are di&s;re|garded, <HI>an&s;wer'd.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>That the Acts of Trade and Naviga|tion, made on purpo&s;e to render the Plantations beneficial to</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>are di&s;regarded in the Charter Governments; and that this Evil cannot be effectually cur'd, but by a Re&s;umption of the Charters.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002216_0029_0FDACFCE52FE32A8">TO which I an&s;wer very particularly and di&s;tinctly,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> THE Complaints on this Head are for the mo&s;t Part of an old Date, and when the Bill again&s;t the Charters was depending in the Hou&s;e of Commons, were produc'd from the Files of the Plantation Board, whither they had bin tran&s;mitted in former Reigns, when Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers in the Plantations were &s;uch great Rarities, that One Collector &s;erv'd Four en|tire Provinces. And can it be thought &s;trange that Merchants, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is Gain, &s;hould have &s;ome|times for Lucre tran&s;gre&s;s'd the Acts of Trade, when there were no Officers to &s;ee them duly ob&s;erv'd? The Ca&s;e is va&s;tly different now. Officers of the Revenue are multiply'd, and are extremely rigorous, &s;o that in|&s;tead of <HI>their</HI> Complaints of unfair Traders, the Mer|chants on the other hand greatly complain of the Op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Officers. Ive &s;een an Account of &s;uch intollerable Hard&s;hips impos'd on fair well-meaning Traders, under Colour of Law, that one would hardly give Credit to the lea&s;t of the Articles, if the Whole had not bin deliver'd publickly in an A&s;&s;embly of one of the Provinces by a worthy Member, and afterwards printed with his name to it. The Author I refer to, after a Recital of the &s;everal Facts, in which he is very full as to every Circum&s;tance, draws up this melanchol|ly Conclu&s;ion, That the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers had by their violent Practices either &s;eiz'd or driven away all the Ve&s;&s;els belonging to that Part of the Country, &s;o that they had no Sloops left to carry their Produce to Market in the adjacent Colonies.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> IF there be &s;ome <HI>late</HI> Complaints, perhaps up|on Examination, they will appear to be ill grounded. I can &s;peak this knowingly with re&s;pect to a Complaint, tran&s;mitted not long &s;ince by the Surveyor General of <HI>North America</HI> and the Collector of <HI>New London,</HI> again&s;t His Maje&s;ty's Colony of <HI>Connecticut.</HI> The&s;e Gentlemen, one or both of them, drew up a Charge again&s;t that innocent and loyal Colony in very &s;evere Terms, as <HI>&s;et|ting the Laws of Trade and Navigation at the utmo&s;t De|fiance.</HI> Whereas in Truth and in Fact, the In&s;tances
<PB N="27" REF="002216_0030_0FDACFCFDB9D4A48">
they produc'd of &s;uch Defiance were clear Proofs of that Colony's Inclination to &s;upport the Laws of Trade and their own Traffick; and on the contrary, what the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers in&s;i&s;ted on was manife&s;tly &s;ub|ver&s;ive of both, and could &s;erve no End in the World but enhancing the Collectors Fees. The Ca&s;e is this: There are on the Coa&s;t of His Maje&s;ty's Colony of <HI>Con|necticut</HI> Eight convenient Ports or Harbours for Ship|ping. The Government there did from the Beginning place a Naval Officer in each of them, to &s;ee that the &s;everal Acts of Trade were duly ob&s;erv'd. After the Act of the 7th and 8th of King <HI>William,</HI> the Collector of the Colony appointed a Deputy in each of the&s;e Ports, who requir'd all Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els, Outward and Inward-bound, to Enter and Clear with him as well as with the Naval Officer, whether they had any Goods on Board paying a Duty to the Crown or not; which they &s;ubmitted to, tho' not oblig'd by Law, as Sir <HI>Wil|liam Thomp&s;on</HI> the late Sollicitor General has upon a full and impartial State of the Ca&s;e given his Opinion. The pre&s;ent Collector, thinking it be&s;t to receive all the Fees him&s;elf, refu&s;es to make any Deputations, or allow the Power of the Naval Officers to be &s;ufficient in his Ab&s;ence, but commands all Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els what&s;oever to repair to the Port of his Re&s;idence, and there to Enter and Clear with him: By which Regu|lation Seven of the Eight Ports are left open for ille|gal Traders, to the great Detriment of the Crown; whil&s;t with equal Injury to the Subject, Sloops &s;ailing from one Town to another, or perhaps to a neighbour|ing Province with no better a Cargo than a few Deals and Turnips, &s;hall be oblig'd to go &s;ometimes 120 Miles out of their Way, which often happens to be further than the Port of Delivery, to find the Collector. The Agent for the Colony has fully repre&s;ented this Hard|&s;hip to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms, and &s;hown the Injury that will be done to the King as well as the Subject by this E&s;tabli&s;hment; but all in vain, there is no Redre&s;s; and what puts one out of all Pa|tience,
<PB N="28" REF="002216_0031_0FDACFD152B17A08">
this very Ca&s;e is cited as one Allegation among others to &s;upport the General Charge again&s;t the Char|ter Governments that they carry on an illegal Commerce.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> IF IT were true that &s;ome Per&s;ons did now and then concern them&s;elves in an illegal Trade, can it be thought ju&s;t or rea&s;onable that the whole Com|munity &s;hould &s;uffer for their private fault? No Body will &s;ay that the Acts of Trade are perfectly ob&s;erv'd in the Provinces immediately under the Crown, or in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> it &s;elf. I believe there is no Corporati|on in the Kingdom, being a Sea-Port, wherein there are not at &s;ome Time or other contraband Goods im|ported, or other Goods clande&s;tinely run, to the preju|dice of the King's Duties. In this Port of <HI>London</HI> great Abu&s;es are daily committed in &s;pight of the utmo&s;t Vigilance to prevent them. The Fraud of re|landing Callicoes after a pretended Exportation, only to receive the Drawback, is a mo&s;t flagrant In&s;tance, if One either con&s;iders the Perjuries that attend it, or the immen&s;e Sums that are thereby rob'd from the Publick, or the va&s;t Injuries that are done by it to the hone&s;t Linen-Draper. And yet, whoever us'd this, or any other Cheat of the like Kind, as an Argument to disfranchi&s;e this Ancient Corporation? The Rule of Law is, <HI>Noxa Caput &s;equitur</HI>; and it is agreeable to Natural Ju&s;tice that every Man &s;hould &s;uffer for his own Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. On the other part, if a Corpo|rate Body were to forfeit their Privileges for every private Per&s;on's Offence, they would be of no Value. A Charter &s;o limited could not &s;tand a Week, nor would be worth the Expence of the Great Seal.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> I MIGHT &s;till make a further Remark. If the Grievances complain'd of were not antiquated Sto|ries, but &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at this Time; if they were fairly repre&s;ented; and la&s;tly, if it were equitable that the Crimes of Per&s;ons in a private Capacity &s;hould be ex|piated by the Publick, yet no Conclu&s;ion could be drawn from the&s;e Premi&s;es prejudicial to the Charters, becau&s;e the di&s;&s;olving them would be no Remedy in
<PB N="29" REF="002216_0032_0FDACFD2D1BEF800">
any &s;ort. The Rea&s;on is plain, that putting this Ca&s;e, not only the In&s;pection of Trade, but the Pro&s;ecu|tion, Tryal, and Puni&s;hment of every Offender would re&s;t in the &s;ame Hands, and be carry'd on in the &s;ame Manner as before. All the Officers of the Revenue are <HI>in the pre&s;ent State of Things</HI> appointed by the Crown; all Breaches of the Acts of Trade, &s;aving a &s;ingle one excepted by Act of Parliament, are cognizable only in the Court of Admiralty, where the Judge and every inferiour Officer are created either by Commi&s;&s;ions un|der the Broad Seal, or by Warrants from the Lord High Admiral. The Laws of the Country are not plea|ded in that Court, but Acts of Parliament, and when, they are &s;ilent, the Civil and Maritime Laws take place. The Forms of Proceeding, were <HI>they</HI> of any Con&s;e|quence, are regulated after the Manner practis'd in <HI>Doctors Commons.</HI> If then his Maje&s;ty &s;hould re&s;ume the Charters, nothing more could be done to pre&s;erve the Acts of Trade than is at pre&s;ent, and therefore how plau&s;ible &s;oever this Pretext may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight, it's plain upon a nearer View that there is no Weight in it.</P>
<P>I am appriz'd that the Judge of the Vice-Admiralty in <HI>New-England</HI> has often complain'd home of the fre|quent Prohibitions &s;erv'd on him from the Courts of Judicature there, which he &s;ays, <HI>Weaken and in a man|ner &s;uppre&s;s the Authority of that Court, and all the good Ends for which it was constituted.</HI> But neither does this Matter in the lea&s;t relate to the Charters, though there were Rea&s;on for the Complaint, as on the other hand, I &s;hall immediately &s;how there is none. The Right of the Courts of Common Law within the Pro|vince of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> to re&s;train the Exce&s;&s;es of the Admiralty Juri&s;diction, are not deriv'd from their Charter, but from &s;ub&s;equent Laws of the Province, confirm'd afterwards by the Crown; which Power therefore, whether the Charters &s;tand or fall, will re|main unhurt, and &s;till the &s;ame. But the Matter of this Complaint is wholly groundle&s;s, which I mu&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="002216_0033_0FDACFD482210370">
particularly &s;how, becau&s;e a Handle has bin taken from it to hurt <HI>New-England</HI> in its Charters. I therefore take leave to &s;ay, That the &s;uperiour Court of Judica|ture for the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's</HI> Bay has a le|gal Power to i&s;&s;ue Prohibitions to the Court of Vice- Admiralty: That it is very fitting and nece&s;&s;ary &s;uch a Power &s;hould be lodg'd in that Court: And, la&s;tly, that the particular Ca&s;es wherein the Judges of that &s;uperiour Court have hitherto exercis'd this Power, were apparently without and beyond the Admiralty Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>To begin with the Power it &s;elf: 'Tis founded on an Act of the A&s;&s;embly pa&s;s'd in the 11th Year of King <HI>William,</HI> and by him confirm'd, entitl'd, <HI>An Act for establi&s;hing a &s;uperiour Court of Judicature, Court of A&s;&s;izes and General Goal Delivery.</HI> The Act after a Re|cital of &s;everal Powers ve&s;ted in the Court, has this general Clau&s;e: <HI>And the &s;aid Court is hereby ve&s;ted with the &s;ame Power as fully and amply to all Intents and Pur|po&s;es what&s;oever as the Courts of</HI> King's Bench, Common- Pleas <HI>and</HI> Exchequer <HI>within His Majesty's Kingdom of</HI> Eng|land <HI>have or ought to have.</HI> By Con&s;equence then, if the Court of <HI>King's-Bench</HI> has a Power to re&s;train the Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> this Court of Judica|ture mu&s;t have the &s;ame in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>THE Rea&s;ons for &s;uch a Re&s;training Power are as &s;trong in <HI>New-England</HI> as in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> It has bin ever boa&s;ted as the peculiar Privilege of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> &amp; the grand Se|curity of his Property to be try'd by his Country and the Laws of the Land; whereas this Admiralty Method of Tryal deprives him of both, as it puts his E&s;tate in the Di&s;po&s;al of a &s;ingle Per&s;on, and makes the Civil Law the Rule of Judgment; which though it may not per|haps properly he call'd Foreign, being the Law of Na|tions, yet 'tis what he has not con&s;ented to him&s;elf, of his Repre&s;entative for him. A Juri&s;diction therefore &s;o &s;ounded ought not to extend beyond what Nece&s;&s;ity requires, that is, to nothing but what is really&punc; tran&s;ac|ted on the High Seas, which not being <HI>infra Corpus
<PB N="31" REF="002216_0034_0FDACFD5D6E90D20">
Comitatus,</HI> is not triable at Common Law. If &s;ome Bounds are not &s;et to the Juri&s;diction of the Admiral|ty, beyond which it &s;hall not pa&s;s, it may in Time, like the Element to which it ought to be confin'd, grow outrageous &amp; overflow the Banks of all the other Courts of Ju&s;tice. This Danger is &s;till greater in the Plantati|ons, where neither the Judge nor any of the Inferior Officers of the Admiralty have Salaries, or perhaps other Dependance than upon what they get by their Fees, and therefore mu&s;t be &s;trongly tempted to receive all Bu&s;ine&s;s that comes before them, however improper for their Cognizance.</P>
<P>IN vain do the Advocates for the Admiralty urge on this Occa&s;ion that an Appeal lies home, and therefore if a Cau&s;e try'd there be found to be <HI>Coram non Judice,</HI> Ju&s;tice will be done to the injur'd Party on the Appeal. For if this Argument has any Force, it would take place in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e an Appeal lies here from the Sen|tences of the Admiralty to the Court of Delegates, and yet that is not thought a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to prevent the Court of <HI>King's-Bench</HI> from granting Prohibitions when they think them nece&s;&s;ary. Be&s;ides it is to be remark'd, that the Appeal does not lie to the <HI>King</HI> and Council as it does from other Courts, but to the Judge of the Admiralty&punc; and therefore one may imagine that the Appellant will have but a <HI>cold Cau&s;e</HI> of it; for I believe it has bin rarely found that any Court was for|ward to limit its own Power.</P>
<P>IF then the Court of Judicature in <HI>New-England</HI> has a right in general to award Prohibitions again&s;t the Court of Vice-Admiralty, there will, I believe be no Di&s;pute as to the particular In&s;tances wherein they have exercis'd this Power. Hitherto there have bin but Three; nor did the Judges come into the&s;e, but upon &s;olemn Argument fir&s;t had before them by the able&s;t Lawyers on the Spot. Not that I &s;uppo&s;e there was any real Difficulty, but it being a Ca&s;e <HI>prima Impre&s;&s;ionis</HI> in that Country, 'twas thought proper to proceed &s;o delibe|rately.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="002216_0035_0FDACFD751A96C60">ONE Prohibition was granted on a Libel fil'd upon the Wool Act of the 10th and 11th of <HI>William</HI> III. which provides, That all Offences therein mention'd &s;hall be try'd in &s;ome <HI>Court of Record,</HI> which 'tis cer|tain the Court of Admiralty is not. Another was i&s;&s;u'd to &s;top Proceedings in a Cau&s;e which had bin try'd before at Common Law, and receiv'd the Judgment of the Court. If the Court of Vice-Admiralty &s;hould a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a Prerogative as this, in&s;tead of being confin'd to Maritime Affairs, it would be the Supreme Court in all Cau&s;es, and the <HI>Dernier Re&s;ort</HI> of Ju&s;tice. The Third Prohibition was upon a Charter Party made and execu|ted upon the Land with a Penalty under Hand &amp; Seal, which neverthele&s;s was libell'd in the Court of Admi|ralty, and the Judge would very gravely have heard and determin'd it, on a Colour of it's having relation to a Voyage, or at lea&s;t to &s;omething which was to be perform'd on the Seas.

<P>IF the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et</HI> Charter were &s;ingly in Que&s;tion, this Allegation would have no place, becau&s;e no Act pa&s;s'd by that A&s;&s;embly has the Force of a Law till the King's Governour has a&s;&s;ented to it, and then it comes home for his Maje&s;ty's Approbation, who if he plea&s;es, annuls it. There is therefore no Danger of their making Laws repugnant to the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; or if they &s;hould, there being a Remedy al|ways at hand, if it be not made u&s;e of, the Fault will lie &s;ome where el&s;e, and can't affect the Province.</P>
<P>BUT let us examine a little, whether any of the other Governments acting under Charters may de&s;erve this Cen&s;ure&punc; in order to which, we mu&s;t con&s;ider what this Phra&s;e [REPUGNANT TO THE LAWS OF ENGLAND] imports. I believe it will be ea&s;ily al|low'd, that a Law may be <HI>various</HI> from the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and yet not <HI>repugnant</HI> to them; or otherwi&s;e the&s;e Governments mu&s;t make no Laws at all, which no Body will &s;ay, who knows that a Right of Legi&s;la|ture is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Part of their Charters, and what indeed the Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing make ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Every Country has Cir|cum&s;tances peculiar to it &s;elf in Re&s;pect of its Soil, Si|tuation, Inhabitants, and Commerce, to all which con|venient Laws mu&s;t with the nice&s;t Care and Judgment be adapted; whereas the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are calcula|ted for their own Meridian, and are many of them no ways &s;uitable to the Plantations, and others not po&s;&s;ible to be executed there.</P>
<P>THIS Point, however clear and evident, has not bin always rightly under&s;tood. There was a pretty extra|ordinary In&s;tance of it a few Years &s;ince, with re&s;pect
<PB N="34" REF="002216_0037_0FDACFDB13E7EAB0">
to a Law in force in <HI>Carolina</HI> for choo&s;ing Jury-men by Ballot. This was part of their Original Body of Laws fram'd by the famous Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> and what they had found by Experience a great Pre&s;ervative to their Liberties and Properties. Yet I don't know how it happen'd, the Lord Palatine and other Lords Proprie|tors of that Province, imagining this Law to be repug|nant to the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that they &s;hould thereby incur a Forfeiture of their Charter, directed their Landgraves to get it repeal'd. The People in that Government, unwilling to part with what they &s;o much e&s;teem'd, &s;ent over two Deputies expre&s;s to &s;et the Matter in a fair Light before their Lord&s;hips. When they arriv'd, I accompany'd them at their De&s;ire to the Board, where after &s;ome &s;hort Debates, we &s;atis|fy'd their Lord&s;hips that their Charter could be in no Danger on this Account, and that one Law might be various from another without being repugnant to it.</P>
<P>HAVING premis'd this Di&s;tinction, I an&s;wer the Que&s;tion in direct Terms, That <HI>then a Law in the Plan|tations may be &s;aid to be repugnant to a Law made in</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>when it flatly contradicts it, &s;o far as the Law made here mentions and relates to the Plantation. Contraria &s;unt ad idem:</HI> And therefore one Thing can|not be &s;aid to be contrary to another, that does not im|mediately relate to it, and diametrically oppo&s;e it. For the Purpo&s;e, if a Law pa&s;s'd here has its Force re|&s;train'd to <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and the Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> on the <HI>Tweed,</HI> no Law in the Plantations can properly be &s;aid to repugn it; becau&s;e whatever Diver&s;ity there may be between them, yet one having no manner of Relation to the other, they are not repugnant. I be|lieve I am Right in my Logick, but am &s;ure I am as to the legal Acceptation of the Phra&s;e, becau&s;e what I advance is founded on the Words of an Act of Parlia|ment. It is the 7<HI>th</HI> and 8<HI>th</HI> of King <HI>William,</HI> which (Cap. 22. Sect 9<HI>th.</HI>) Enacts, <HI>That all Laws, By-Laws, U|&s;ages or Cu&s;toms at this Time, or which hereafter &s;hall be in Practice, or endeavoured or pretended to be in Force

or Practice in any of the Plantations, which are in any wi&s;e repugnant to the before-mention'd Laws or any of them,</HI> SO FAR AS THEY DO RELATE TO THE SAID PLANTATIONS OR ANY OF THEM, <HI>or which are any ways repugnant to this pre&s;ent Act, or to any other Law hereafter to be made in this Kingdom,</HI> SO FAR AS SUCH LAW SHALL RELATE TO AND MENTION THE SAID PLANTATIONS, <HI>are illegal, null, and void, to all Intents and Purpo&s;es what&s;oever.</HI> If then we'll take the Sen&s;e of the Phra&s;e from an Act of Parliament, (and where can we have a better Expo&s;itor?) no Man will pre|tend that there ever was a Law made in the Plantati|ons repugnant to the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> And yet I am apt to think that if an A&s;&s;embly &s;hould do a Thing &s;o illegal, they ought to be puni&s;h'd for it them&s;elves, and not their Con&s;tituents. They were cho&s;en and de|legated by the People to frame Laws according to the Powers given them by their re&s;pective Charters, which if they exceed, why &s;hould a whole Country &s;uffer for their Offence? This would be to puni&s;h the Innocent for the Guilty, and is not agreeable to the Law in other Ca&s;es, where if the Tru&s;tee does any Act that is illegal and beyond his Tru&s;t, the <HI>Cestuyq. Tru&s;t</HI> is not oblig'd by it, nor to be hurt for it.</P>
<P>IF the Words will receive any other Con&s;truction than what the Act of Parliament has put upon them, I think it mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to be this; that the Paten|tees &s;hould not under colour of their particular Charters pre&s;ume to make any Laws incon&s;i&s;tent with the great Charter and other Laws of <HI>England,</HI> by which the Lives, Liberties and Properties of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are &s;ecur'd. It &s;eems rea&s;onable enough to think that the Crown might intend by this Injunction to provide for all it's Subjects, that they might not be oppre&s;s'd by arbitrary Power; but in whatever di&s;tant Part of the World they were &s;ettled, being &s;till Subjects, they &s;hould have the U&s;age of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> be protected by the &s;ame mild Laws, &amp; enjoy the &s;ame happy Government, as if they continued within the Realm. Con&s;ider the Expre&s;&s;ion in this Light, and the Colonies (which I am defending) are &s;till &s;afe,

having in no re&s;pect impair'd, but many Ways improv'd the Liberty of the Subject, as I have before &s;hown un|der another Head. If hereafter &s;o unaccountable a Thing &s;hould happen, that tho&s;e Privileges which were de&s;ign'd as Fences again&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion and De&s;potick Power prove the means to introduce both, and the Bo|dy of the People &s;hould petition to be reliev'd from the Yoke of their Charters, for my part, I'll be no long|er an Advocate for them.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>5</HI>th Objection, that the Charter Colonies will grow great and formida|ble. <HI>an&s;wer'd.</HI></NOTE>THERE is one Thing more I have heard often urg'd again&s;t the Charter Colonies, and in|deed 'tis what one meets with from People of all Conditions and Qualities, tho' with due re&s;pect to their better Judgments, I can &s;ee neither Rea&s;on nor Colour for it. 'Tis &s;aid, <HI>that their encrea&s;ing Numbers and Wealth join'd to their great Di&s;tance from</HI> Britain <HI>will give them an Op|portunity in the Cour&s;e of &s;ome Years to throw off their De|pendance on the Nation, and declare them&s;elves a free State, if not curb'd in Time by being made entirely &s;ubject to the Crown.</HI> Whereas in Truth there's no Body tho' but little acquainted with the&s;e or any of the <HI>Northern</HI> Plantations, who does not know and confe&s;s, that their Poverty and the declining State of their Trade is &s;o great at pre&s;ent&punc; that there's far more Danger of their linking, without &s;ome extraordinary Support from the Crown, than of their ever revolting from it.

&s;o dangerous an Enterprize. It is for this Rea&s;on I have often wondered to hear &s;ome Great Men profe&s;s their Belief of the Fea&s;iblene&s;s of it, and the Probability of i'ts &s;ome Time or other actually coming to pa&s;s, who yet with the &s;ame Breath advi&s;e that all the Go|vernments on the Continent be form'd into one, by being brought under one Vice-Roy, and into one A&s;&s;embly. For &s;urely if we in earne&s;t believ'd that there was or would be hereafter a Di&s;po&s;ition in the Provinces to Re|bel and declare them&s;elves Independent, it would be good Policy to keep them di&s;united; becau&s;e if it were po&s;&s;i|ble they could contrive &s;o wild and ra&s;h an Undertaking, yet they would not be hardy enough to put it in Exe|cution, unle&s;s they could fir&s;t &s;trengthen them&s;elves by a Confederacy of all the Parts.</P>
<P>BUT to return from this &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion: Our Neigh|bours of <HI>Holland,</HI> who are allow'd to be a wi&s;e State, did not entertain the&s;e Jealou&s;ies of their Subjects in <HI>India,</HI> when they were a young &amp; growing Plantation, nor do they even now when they are a potent flouri&s;hing People. Had they done &s;o, and in con&s;equence of it re&s;train'd and check'd them, <HI>Holland</HI> would not at this Day have drawn &s;uch immen&s;e Riches from that Part of the World, and furni&s;h'd all <HI>Europe</HI> with <HI>Indian</HI> Commodities. And yet what Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign'd for the Jealou&s;ies we enter|tain of our Colonies, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have not, and far &s;tronger with re&s;pect to their <HI>Batavian</HI> Subjects? If the Di&s;tance be urg'd as an Argument, every body knows that <HI>New-England</HI> is but a thou&s;and Leagues from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Shore, but the <HI>Dutch</HI> mu&s;t run eight Times that Ground from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> before they arrive at <HI>Batavia,</HI> Or if the Number and Power of the Inhabitants &s;hould give any Umbrage, this is an Article which with re&s;pect to <HI>Batavia</HI> won't admit of the mo&s;t di&s;tant Compari&s;on. The General of that Place maintains a Port &s;uperiour to many Sovereign Princes in <HI>Europe,</HI> and has all the Kings in <HI>Java</HI> in a manner Tributary to him. He has 3000 &s;tanding European Troops, not reckoning the Natives&punc; &amp; all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Inhabitants live in that flowing Wealth and Plenty which makes <HI>Batavia</HI> look like the Capital of a Great &amp; Migh+ty

Empire. But do the States of <HI>Holland</HI> look on this their pro&s;perous Condition with envious or jealous Eyes? Ju&s;t the rever&s;e; they do every thing in their Power &s;till to promote and advance it, well knowing their foreign Plan|tations can't thrive, but they mu&s;t receive the Benefit of it them&s;elves, and therefore ju&s;tly e&s;teem the Wealth of their Subjects Abroad as their own Riches. Why then &s;hould not <HI>Great-Britain</HI> form the &s;ame Judgment, and proceed by the like Mea&s;ures in regard to her <HI>American</HI> Dominions, from whence &s;he receives the greate&s;t Ad|vantages? It were no difficult Task to prove that <HI>London</HI> has ri&s;en out of the Plantations, and not out of <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis to them we owe our va&s;t Fleets of Merchant Ships, and con&s;equently the Increa&s;e of our Seamen, and Improve|ment of our Navigation. 'Tis their Tobacco, Sugar, Fi&s;h, Oil, Logwood and other Commodities, which have ena|bled us to &s;upport our Trade in <HI>Europe,</HI> to bring the Bal|lance of &s;ome Countries in our Favour, which would o|therwi&s;e be again&s;t us, and to make the Figure we do at pre&s;ent, and have done for near a Century pa&s;t, in all Parts of the commercial World.</P>
<P>THE Mother Kingdom mu&s;t therefore needs rejoyce in the Pro&s;perity of every one of her Colonies, becau&s;e it is her own Pro&s;perity. The Fable of the Belly and Members illu&s;trates this Argument. It would be unrea|&s;onable for the Belly to grudge the Labour of dige&s;ting the Food and di&s;per&s;ing the Blood and Juices to the ex|tream Parts, &s;eeing they return purify'd and exalted in the Circulation. There's a clo&s;e Analogy between the Natural Body and the Body Politick; as in the one, a Finger can't ake, but the Whole feels it, &s;o in the other the remote&s;t Plantation can't decay, but the Nation mu&s;t &s;uffer with it.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid that the Charter Colonies are not &s;o va|luable as &s;ome of the re&s;t, I an&s;wer, that the Inhabi|tants have the more need of their Charters to make them amends; for People mu&s;t have &s;ome Incourage|ment to &s;it down on a cold and barren Soil. Yet I have &s;hown before that they are many ways of great U&s;e and Advantage to the Crown; to which I add, that they will be more &s;o than ever in a few Years, to &s;trengthen the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire in <HI>America</HI> again&s;t the
<PB N="39" REF="002216_0042_0FDACFE2928AD768">
formidable Settlement of <HI>Loi&s;iana,</HI> which for &s;ome Years pa&s;t has bin carry'd on by the <HI>French</HI> with great Ex|pence, and with the utmo&s;t Vigour and Application. This Country was given by the late <HI>French</HI> King to the <HI>SieurCroizat,</HI> but is now (as every Body knows) in the famous <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi</HI> Company, who have a Fund of a Hun|dred Millions of Livres for this very Purpo&s;e, and are daily &s;ending over a va&s;t Number of People for Tillage, as well as all &s;orts of Artificers, with proper Materials for making a Settlement. It is &s;ituate on the great Ri|ver of <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> and by help of the &s;uperiour Lakes and Rivers, on &s;ome of which the <HI>French</HI> have already erec|ted Fortre&s;&s;es, a Communication may be made between <HI>New-France</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which indeed was the very Scheme of the <HI>French</HI> Court in projecting this Enterprize, as is expre&s;ly declar'd in the Preamble to <HI>Croizat</HI>'s Patent. 'Tis ea&s;y then to &s;ee that the <HI>French</HI> will be hereby enabled to draw a Line, and in Time have a Chain of Towns on the Back of all our Colonies from the Borders of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> to the we&s;termo&s;t Part of <HI>Ca|rolina.</HI> And what <HI>Briton</HI> can con&s;ider this without being in Pain for the Fate of our Provinces in future Times? E&s;|pecially &s;ince we know that the <HI>Illinois</HI> and other War|like <HI>Indian</HI> Nations lye near the <HI>French,</HI> and for many Rea&s;ons, which it would be too much a Digre&s;&s;ion to re|count here, are devoted to their Intere&s;t, and by con&s;e|quence ready at all Times to joyn their Forces in any Attempt again&s;t us.</P>
<P>THIS being the Ca&s;e, I think with humble Submi&s;&s;ion, it is very prepo&s;terous to amu&s;e our &s;elves with vain, i|maginary Pro&s;pects of what is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to come to pa&s;s, &amp; neglect doing what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; I mean, the enlarging and &s;upporting our Provinces, that they may be able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t being one Day totally extirpated by a Foreign Power. And then I have only to &s;ugge&s;t an old approv'd Maxim, <HI>That every Thing is be&s;t pre&s;erv'd by the &s;ame Principles by which it was at fir&s;t form'd,</HI> and con&s;equently the be&s;t Method of en|couraging the Charter Colonies is, to pre&s;erve their Pri|vileges inviolate, without which they had never bin|&s;etled.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="002216_0043_0FDACFE414917CD8"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>3</HI>d <HI>Propo&s;ition,</HI> That it is not the In|tere&s;t of the Crown to re&s;ume the Charters f forfeited.</NOTE>ANOTHER Propo&s;ition I advanced was, That if the&s;e Governments &s;hould be adjudg'd to have forfeited their Charters back to the Crown, yet it is not the true Intere&s;t of the Crown to re&s;ume them.</P>
<P>IT is a generally receiv'd Opinion, that the People in the Plantations have an Intere&s;t di&s;tinct from that of the Crown; when it is &s;uppo&s;ed at the &s;ame time, that the Intere&s;t of the Governours, they being the King's Repre|&s;entatives, is one with the Crown; and from the&s;e Pre|mi&s;es it is concluded, that there can't be too much Pow|er given to the Governours or too little to the People. Whereas, with humble Submi&s;&s;ion, I conceive this to be a very wrong Judgment, and that the Rever&s;e of it is true. The only Intere&s;t of the People is to thrive and flouri&s;h in their Trade, which is the true Intere&s;t of the Crown and Nation, becau&s;e they reap the Profit of it. When on the other Hand, the View that Governours generally have is private Gain, which being too often acquir'd by di&s;coura|ging and oppre&s;&s;ing Trade, is not only an Intere&s;t di&s;tinct from that of the Crown, but extreamly prejudicial to it. The Trade of a young Plantation is like a tender Plant, &amp; &s;hould be cheri&s;h'd with the fonde&s;t Care; but if in&s;tead of that, it meets with the rough Hand of Oppre&s;&s;ion, it will &s;oon die. The proper Nur&s;ery for this Plant is a free Go|vernment, where the Laws are &s;acred, Property &s;ecure, &amp; Ju&s;tice not only impartially, but expeditiou&s;ly di&s;tributed. For to what purpo&s;e &s;hall the Merchant expo&s;e his E&s;tate to the Dangers of the Sea, the Enemy, and many more Ac|cidents, if after all he can't &s;ave it at Home from Rapine and Violence?</P>
<P>As this is evident, &s;o is it that whatever injures the Trade of the Plantations, mu&s;t in Proportion affect <HI>Great- Britain,</HI> the Source and Center of their Commerce; from whence they have their Manufactures, whether they make their Returns, and where all their Superlucration is lodg'd. The Blow then may &s;trike the Colonies fir&s;t, but it comes Home at la&s;t, and falls heavie&s;t on our &s;elves.</P>
<P>THAT Governours are apt to abu&s;e their Power and grow rich by Oppre&s;&s;ion, Experience &s;hows us. We have &s;een not many Years &s;ince, &s;ome Governours &s;eiz'd by their Injur'd People, and &s;ent Pri&s;oners to

Others after being recall'd, have been pro&s;ecuted at the <HI>King's-Bench Bar,</HI> pur&s;uant to an Act of Parliament made in the Reign of the late King <HI>William,</HI> whereby it is provided, That Gover|nours &s;hall be impleadable at Home for any Injuries done in their Go|vernments Abroad. We have had more than one flagrant In&s;tance of this very lately, where Governours have bin convicted and cen&s;ur'd not &s;o properly for oppre&s;&s;ing, as for a direct plundering their People, and &s;uch other Acts of Mi&s;-rule and lawle&s;s Power, as one would not have thought it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have committed if Experience had not &s;hown it to be more than po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I don't however intend by what is here &s;aid, to reproach our own Nati|on, as if we were greater Sinners than others, or to reflect on the pre&s;ent Times, as if they were wor&s;e than the former. I know that the &s;ame Abu&s;es have bin practis'd in every Age as well as this, &amp; in Foreign Colonies as well as our own. The ancient <HI>Romans</HI> were as brave &amp; as vertuous a Peo|ple as any in the World, and yet their Procon&s;uls or Governours were very guilty in this re&s;pect. Their Corruption was &s;o notorious as to be di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by the Name of <HI>Crimen Repetundarum,</HI> a Phra&s;e not us'd in any other meaning, and deriv'd from the Obligation which the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate laid on their Governours to make Re&s;titution.</P>
<P>NOR have the modern Governours in the <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plantations bin le&s;s Criminal. It's a famous Story of a Great Mini&s;ter at the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> who writ to his Friend the Vice-Roy of <HI>Peru,</HI> that great Com|plaints were made again&s;t him for having extorted immen&s;e Sums of Mo|ney from the People in his Government; <HI>Which,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I wi&s;h may be true, or el&s;e you are undone.</HI> It &s;eems the &s;ame Thing that wounded him, was nece&s;&s;ary to heal him; and what put him out of Favour, was the only Thing could re&s;tore him,</P>
<P>INDEED it can hardly be expected but the&s;e Corruptions mu&s;t hap|pen, when one con&s;iders that few Gentlemen will cro&s;s the Seas for a Go|vernment, who&s;e Circum&s;tances are not a little &s;treight at Home, &amp; that they know by how &s;light &amp; uncertain a Tenure they hold their Com|mi&s;&s;ions; from whence they wi&s;ely conclude, that no Time is to be lo&s;t. And then for the Account to be rendred at Home, that is not thought of at &s;o great a Di&s;tance, for <HI>Procul a Jove, procul a Fulmine.</HI></P>
<P>TO enlarge then the Power of Governours, is to give them greater Power to oppre&s;s; and to vacate the Charters is to enlarge their Power, the Government in that Ca&s;e of Cour&s;e devolving upon them; as we &s;ee in tho&s;e Plantations which never had any Charters, but are imme|diately dependent on the Crown. There they have, in a manner, the intire Legi&s;lative &amp; Executive Powers, or at lea&s;t &s;o great an Influence on the con&s;tituent Parts of the Former, as leaves them little <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> than Nominal Sharers, &s;erving rather as Screens to the Govern <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a Defence to the People. The Militia is ab&s;olutely ve&s;ted in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Go|vernours, which influences all Elections of Repre&s;entatives: They appoint Judges, Ju&s;tices, Sheriffs and other Civil Officers with the Con&s;ent, it's &s;aid indeed, of the Council; but that &s;uch Con&s;ent voluntary or involuntary will ever be refus'd, &s;eems too much to be expected, if we con&s;ider
<PB N="42" REF="002216_0045_0FDACFE7172AAA00">
that altho' the Governours do not indeed appoint the Council, yet they recommend proper Per&s;ons to the King; and it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a Gentleman who is intru&s;ted with the chief Command of a Province, and is actually on the Spot, will be thought the be&s;t Judge who are fit to &s;erve, and therefore his Recommendations will almo&s;t always prevail. Be&s;ides, if there be a Turn to &s;erve, or an Emergency real or imaginary, &amp; any of the Members &s;hould be &s;o refractory as not to give into his Mea|&s;ures with an implicit Faith, the Governour can &s;u&s;pend as many of them as he plea&s;es; and when he has reduc'd the Board under a Num|ber limited in his In&s;tructions, he can then fill it up to that Number <HI>in&s;tanter</HI> with whom he plea&s;es; and who will they be, may we pre|&s;ume, but &s;uch as are pa&s;&s;ively obedient to his Will? And too many &s;uch there are to be found in all Colonies &s;o con&s;tituted, who are con|tent to be <HI>&s;adled</HI> them&s;elves, provided they may <HI>ride</HI> others under the <HI>chief Rider.</HI> I mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that where there are no Charters, there are Courts of Equity e&s;tabli&s;h'd, in which the Governour is always Chancellor, and for the mo&s;t part Chief Ju&s;tice, and Ordinary at the &s;ame time; which puts the E&s;tates, Lives and Liberties of the Inhabi|tants, &s;aving the Liberty of Appeal at Home, intirely in his Di&s;po&s;al; and even an Appeal in all Ca&s;es under a con&s;iderable Sum, in all Ca&s;e; of the ordinary Juri&s;diction, and in all Ca&s;es Capital, is either di&s;allow'd by his In&s;tructions, or wholly in the Governour's Brea&s;t to allow or not</P>
<P>THE Sum of my Argument is, That the Benefit which <HI>Great-Britain</HI> receives from the Plantations, ari&s;es from their Commerce: That Op|pre&s;&s;ion is the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite Thing in the World to Commerce, and the mo&s;t de&s;tructive Enemy it can have: That Governours have in all Times, and in all Countries, bin too much inclin'd to oppre&s;s. And con|&s;equently it cannot be the Intere&s;t of the Nation to increa&s;e their Power, and le&s;&s;en the Liberties of the People. I am &s;o &s;anguine in this Opinion, that I really think it would be for the Service of the Crown &amp; Nation to incorporate tho&s;e Governments which have no Char<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> rather than Disfranchize tho&s;e that have.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t Thing I propos'd to con&s;ider was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>4</HI>th <HI>Propo&s;ition,</HI> That it &s;eems incon|&s;i&s;tent with Ju&s;tice to Di&s;franchize the Charter Colonies by an Act of Parliament.</NOTE>
how far it may be con&s;i&s;tent with Ju&s;tice, to deprive the Colonies of their Charters, with|out giving them a fair Tryal or any previous Notice.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that Bills of Attainder, &s;uch as this would be, have bin &s;eldom us'd in <HI>England,</HI> and then only upon the mo&s;t extraordinary Oc|ca&s;ions: As when flagrant Crimes have been committed of a new and unu&s;ual Nature, again&s;t which the Law had made no Provi&s;ion; or when the Witne&s;&s;es have avoided, and perhaps by the Contrivance of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">; or la&s;tly, which is the mo&s;t common Ca&s;e, when the attainted <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> having him&s;elf ab&s;conded, and fled from Ju&s;tice, has thereby made <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> extrajudicial Proceeding Ju&s;tifiable. It is al&s;o as certain that neither of the&s;e Things can be pleaded in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, which I need not be particular in &s;howing, becau&s;e not &s;ugge&s;ted, nor is there the lea&s;t Colour for &s;uch Sugge&s;tion. And yet I pretend to know the People in the Charter Governments &s;o well, and to be &s;o thoroughly acquainted with their meek Principles of Obedience, that I dare affirm
<PB N="43" REF="002216_0046_0FDACFE923674350">
if &s;uch an Act &s;hould pa&s;s, however rigorous and &s;evere they might think it within them&s;elves, they would not let fall an indecent Word of their Superiours, but would receive the News with the lowe&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion: So great is their Loyalty to the King, and &s;o profound their Regard for the Re&s;olutions of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly in the World. However, &s;eeing there is no &s;uch Act already pa&s;s'd, and 'tis to be hop'd from the Honour &amp; Ju&s;tice of Parliaments, never will, it can't be thought a Crime mode&s;tly to &s;tate the Hard|&s;hip of the Ca&s;e: I don't mean with re&s;pect to the Merits of it, which have bin already con&s;ider'd, but as to the <HI>Manner of Proceeding by Bill in Parliament.</HI> It is a mo&s;t &s;acred and unalterable Rule of Ju&s;tice, and has ever bin &s;o e&s;teem'd by all the civiliz'd Nations of the World, that no Per&s;on be depriv'd of Life, Liberty or E&s;tate, or any thing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, till he has had Time and Opportunity to make his Defence. And if the Matter in Judgment be of great Value, dearly paid for, and long enjoy'd, it adds much to the Weight of the Argument, and aggravates the Injury in depriving the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors unheard. Now this is the Ca&s;e of the Charter Governments. How great the Purcha&s;e Con&s;ideration was, has been before &s;aid; but how valuable the Charters them&s;elves are can never be &s;aid, Liberty being ine&s;timable. And for the Time they have enjoy'd them, were they not on Record, it would be what the Civilians call <HI>Immemorial,</HI> one of them being above Four&s;core Years &s;tanding. It &s;eems therefore a Severity without a Precedent, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> People who have the Misfortune of being a Thou&s;and Leagues di&s;tant from their Sovereign, a Misfortune great enough in it &s;elf, &s;hould UNSUMMON'D, UNHEARD, IN ONE DAY be depriv'd of all their valuable Privileges, which they and their Fathers have enjoy'd for near a Hundred Years. It's true, the Legi&s;lative Power is ab&s;olute and unaccountable, and King, Lords and Commons may do what they plea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, but the Que&s;tion here is not about <HI>Power,</HI> but <HI>Right: And &s;hall not the Supream Judicature of all the Nation do right</HI>? One may &s;ay, that what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Parliament can't do ju&s;tly, they can't do at all. <HI>In maximis minima e&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ntia.</HI> The higher the Power is, the greater Caution is to be us'd in the Execution of it, becau&s;e the Sufferer is helple&s;s &amp; without Re&s;ort.</P>
<P>WHEN in an Arbitrary Reign, the Charter of <HI>New-England</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> fir&s;t gave the Colony Notice to prepare for their Trial. Altho' this was a Pro&s;ecution at Law, and the High Court of Parliament is not &s;trictly confin'd to the Forms of the Courts below, yet it is not doubted but the great Fountain of Law &amp; Ju&s;tice will have &s;ome regard, if not to all the Rules made for inferiour Judicatures, yet to &s;uch as are E&s;&s;ential to Ju&s;tice. And &s;o in other Ca&s;es it has. For the Purpo&s;e: If a Bill be brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons that touches any Man's Property in <HI>Ireland,</HI> it mu&s;t lie 30 Days, that the Party may have Notice and not &s;uffer unheard. Why then &s;hould not a rea&s;onable Time be allow'd to the Subjects in <HI>America,</HI> in Proportion to their more di&s;tant Situation; &s;eeing they are no le&s;s the Subjects of the Crown, than the Inhabitants of <HI>Ireland</HI>; and Liberty is at lea&s;t as va|luable as Property; and &s;urely the concern of whole Provinces challen|ges as much regard as the Intere&s;t of a &s;ingle Per&s;on. If it &s;hould be &s;aid, as I confe&s;s a great Mini&s;ter once &s;aid to me, That <HI>the Regulation of Charters mu&s;t be look'd on as Part of the publick Oeconomy, and not as the Affair of any particular Per&s;on or Province</HI>; I humbly ap|prehend,
<PB N="44" REF="002216_0047_0FDACFEA12CAAB40">
with the utmo&s;t Deference to that great Per&s;on, that this does not reach the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. It's indeed very rea&s;onable that all publick Affairs be &s;ubject to the Determination of the publick Wi&s;dom, and there's no Occa&s;ion to notify any Body, becau&s;e every Body is &s;up|pos'd to be pre&s;ent in the Repre&s;entative Body of the Whole; but here the Provinces to be cen&s;ur'd &amp; depriv'd have no Repre&s;entative in Parliament, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd as ab&s;ent Per&s;ons &s;uffering unheard.</P>
<P>I KNOW of but one thing more that can be &s;aid to palliate a Pro|ceeding again&s;t the Charters in this way, which is, <HI>That the Provin|ces always have their re&s;pective Agents at Court, who may be heard by Petition before the Bill pa&s;&s;es into an Act.</HI> To which I an&s;wer, fir&s;t, that &s;ometimes they have Agents here, and at other Times they have not. Next, that a Bill may pa&s;s into an Act without the Know|lege of the Agents, they having no Citation. This had once like to have bin the Ca&s;e, when a Bill of this Nature was formerly brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons; and certainly had prov'd &s;o, if the Agent for <HI>New-England</HI> had at that nice Juncture bin indi&s;po&s;ed in his Health, or but a Day's Journey out of Town, or if he had not bin more than ordina|rily active &amp; diligent when he was in Town. And, la&s;tly, I mu&s;t oberve that Agents are only in&s;tructed in Things that fall within the ordinary Cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s, &amp; when any thing of a new &amp; extraordinary Nature is brought on the Carpet, they have a general In&s;truction to pray for Time in order to notify their Principals, &amp; receive their &s;pecial Commands. Be&s;ides, it's well known that the Right Honourable the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Trade and Plantations were, at the Time before mentioned, prepared to urge many Complaints both New &amp; Old; to which Facts it had bin impo&s;&s;i|ble for any Agent to an&s;wer <HI>oretenus,</HI> without being ever appriz'd of them. To conclude, what <HI>tho&s;e Governments</HI> de&s;ire of their Superiours at home is, that they may not be judg'd and condemn'd unheard. And I cannot but flatter my &s;elf they will obtain it, whether I con&s;ider the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Demand it &s;elf, or the celebrated Ju&s;tice &amp; Lenity of His Maje&s;ty's Government, or the Importance of the Thing in Que&s;tion to the Provinces concern'd. I mention this la&s;t particular, being &s;ure they would reckon the lo&s;s of their Privileges a greater Calamity, than if their Hou&s;es were all in Flames at once. Nor can they be ju&s;tly blam'd, the one being a reparable Evil, but the other irreparable Burnt Hou&s;es may ri&s;e again out of their A&s;hes, and even more Beautiful than before, but 'tis to be fear'd that Liberty <HI>once lo&s;t, is lo&s;t for ever.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have ventur'd into the World my Thoughts on the <HI>New-England</HI> Charters; happy! if my imperfect E&s;&s;ay may provoke &s;ome learned Pen to do full Ju&s;tice to the Subject, which yet in the great Scarcity of Friends that the&s;e Governments have, &s;eems too much to be expected. In the mean Time, being my &s;elf a Native of one of them, I could not forbear &s;howing my Good-will; for how little &s;o|ever one is able to write, yet when the Liberties of one's Country are threatned, it's &s;till more difficult to be &s;ilent. The Dumb Son of <HI>Crae&s;us,</HI> when he &s;aw an Attempt made on his Father's Life, broke into &s;udden Speech by a &s;trong Effort of Nature. It's a fine Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Sallu&s;t,</HI> which I've plac'd in the Title Page of this little Work, <HI>Pulchrum e&s;t Patriae benefacere, etiam benedicere haud ab&s;urdum e&s;t.</HI> Every Man would be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ubitious to do his Country each of the&s;e Services, and if I have not been Fortunate enough to attain to <HI>Either</HI> of 'em, THIS &s;hall be my Satisfac|tion, that I have always aim'd and endeavour'd at <HI>Both.</HI></P>
