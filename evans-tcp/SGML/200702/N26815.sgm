<HEAD>THE Author's Dedication. TO MY FRIEND CHARLES GEORGE GRAUMANN, ST. PETERSBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>"OLD love ru&s;ts not," &s;ays our German adage, and, like many others, it is fal&s;e; for a thou&s;|and times in my life have I &s;een old love ru&s;t, nay, ru&s;t, and &s;o completely moulder away, that not the lea&s;t memory of the fonde&s;t and mo&s;t endearing con|nections &s;eemed to remain.</P>
<P>Let us my dear GRAUMANN, &s;ub&s;titute friend|&s;hip for love, and &s;ay, "Old friend&s;hip ru&s;ts not." With grateful heart, then, I can rai&s;e my eyes to hea|ven, and exclaim, "The adage is true!"</P>
<P>My faithful, my generous friend for eighteen years, far di&s;tant removed as &s;ometimes lay the paths we have pur&s;ued in the journey through life, we have never forgotten to cheri&s;h our acquaintance with kind remembrances. Allow me, then, to indulge the delightful hope, that in tho&s;e regions to which death is our com|mon guide, and where, by various caur&s;es, our wan|derings mu&s;t all terminate at la&s;t, you will offer the &s;ame generous hand to the mature old man, which you gave to the ri&s;ing youth.</P>
<P>The child of my fancy, which I now pre&s;ent to you, deign to receive with that indulgence, with which, eighteen years ago, you conde&s;cended to li&s;ten to the fir&s;t prattle of my nur&s;e. Whatever faults you may di&s;cover in it, think &s;till that it is my child, and, for the father's &s;ake, you will not ca&s;t it from you!</P>

<HEAD>MY LITERARY LIFE.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following account of the Literary Life of Kotzebue is written by him&s;elf. Sill pre&s;erving the narrative in the Author's own words, the tran&s;lator has omitted many things which, to the Engli&s;h reader, would have been unintere&s;ting, and which would have extended this article to an exce&s;&s;ive length.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>AS an author, I have experienced both good and bad &s;ucce&s;s, both in a high degree, both fre|quently unmerited. I flatter my&s;elf that it may be u&s;eful to young men de&s;irous of entering upon the &s;lippery career of literature, to read the hi&s;tory of a man, who has not reached the goal indeed&mdash; for how few ever do reach it!&mdash;but who has &s;o far advanced before them in the progre&s;s towards it; one who, without ceremony, joins their circle, and relates without di&s;gui&s;e when he fell, when he erred, and when he was deceived; where he enjoyed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Nine, and where he mi&s;took the ravings of a Bacchante for the in&s;piration of the Mu&s;e.</P>
<P>Come hither, then, ye inexperienced youths, who have, for the fir&s;t time, dipped the tip of your tongue in the honey of Parna&s;&s;us, and think it de|&s;irable becau&s;e it is &s;weet; &s;it down and li&s;ten to me. You &s;ee I am in the vein; my &s;oul is uncon|&s;trained, and my lips are opened to confe&s;s with candour when I have been deluded by vanity, and when my mind has been warmed with the feelings of the true and the beautiful.</P>
<P>Ri&s;e then! ri&s;e before me, ye fairy phantoms of my happy childhood! In remembrance you now &s;carce form a part of the being I now am! Ri&s;e and hover round me, ye gentle &s;hades!&mdash;Gracious Providence! &s;uffer once more tho&s;e delightful hours to ri&s;e out of the ocean of the pa&s;t, like a dim mi&s;t before my fancy!</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="035693_0004_10064C59D256FDF8">Seize then the fleeting &s;hades as they pa&s;s!&mdash; See&s;t thou there that boy who hangs with rapt at|tention on his mother's tongue, as &s;he reads to him and his &s;i&s;ter &s;ome winter evening the intere&s;ting tale?&mdash;That boy was your&s;elf!&mdash;See&s;t thou again how he makes the chair his table, and the foot&s;tool his chair? See how he devours the romance, while ball and playthings lie neglected in the corner!&mdash; That boy was your&s;elf!</P>
<P>My honoured mother&mdash;Heaven be prai&s;ed &s;he &s;till lives, &s;he hears my grateful acknowledgments&mdash; My good mother, when but a very young widow, denied her&s;elf many of the plea&s;ures and enjoy|ments of life to devote her&s;elf entirely to the edu|cation of her children. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ta&s;te, reading, &s;en&s;ibility, and a rich portion of patient maternal affection. With the&s;e qualities, her efforts could not be wholly un&s;ucce&s;sful She provided precep|tors of different kinds, but to her own di&s;cernment and ta&s;te I owe more than to the tutors to who&s;e care my in&s;truction was confided.</P>
<P>In the evening I u&s;ed to read to her in the par|lour. The fir&s;t book that made a lively impre&s;&s;ion on me was a Collection of Tales &s;elected from all languages, then in great repute; the next was Don Quixote; Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe then engro&s;&s;ed my fan|cy, and I wi&s;hed my&s;elf the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;ome de|&s;art I&s;land.</P>
<P>Even in my &s;ixth year I began to compo&s;e rude e&s;&s;ays in ver&s;e; not long after I made my fir&s;t dra|matic effort. I made a comedy, which was ju&s;t the length of an octavo page. I was &s;en&s;ible, indeed, that it ought to be much longer, in order to re&s;em|ble a comedy; but who was to teach me the art of &s;pinning out the thread, and expanding my mate|rials?</P>
<P>I now come to that incident of my life, which, in its con&s;equences, produced the greate&s;t influence on my character, and from my tendere&s;t childhood
<PB N="vii" REF="035693_0005_10064C5B5E052A58">
irrevocably de&s;tined me to be a dramatic writer. The late Abt, the player, came with his &s;trolling company to Weimar. Since I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any power of thought, there had been no players in Weimar, and my curio&s;ity was unbounded. Mu&s;aeus, the amiable and excellent Mu&s;aeus, who was attached to me from a child, offered to take me to the theatre.</P>
<P>I went with a kind of reverential awe; my ex|pectation was wound up to the highe&s;t pitch. The piece was Klop&s;tock's death of Adam. Mu&s;aeus placed me before him on a bench, that I might &s;ee over the heads of the &s;pectators. The curtain drew up. I was all ear, all eye. Not a word, not a movement e&s;caped me. Never had I before ex|perienced &s;uch powerful impre&s;&s;ions. I returned home enchanted. Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe and the de|&s;art i&s;land di&s;appeared. The theatre now engro&s;&s;ed my whole &s;oul.</P>
<P>My joy, therefore, was unbounded, when the Duche&s;s Amelia, that favourite of the Mu&s;es, e&s;|tabli&s;hed a theatre at Weimar. Several of the mo&s;t celebrated performers of the time came there, and among others, the admirable Eckhof. I never omitted any opportunity of going to the play, and I wondered that tho&s;e who could do what they plea|&s;ed, could prefer any other &s;pecies of entertainment. As a proof of my attention, I could repeat the whole of Le&s;&s;ing's Emilia Galotti without ever having had the book in my hand. To the honour of the fa&s;hiona|ble world at Weimar, I mu&s;t confe&s;s indeed that Emilia Galotti was very often performed, and always to full hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Meanwhile I was a pupil of Mu&s;aeus in the Gymna|&s;ium <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Weimar. Among other things, we had every Saturday an hour dedicated to the reading of little poetical attempts. At this period the rage for ballets was at its height, and the magazines &s;warmed with terrific &s;tories of chivalry and gho&s;ts. I com|po&s;ed
<PB N="viii" REF="035693_0006_10064C5D755503E0">
a ballet in the ta&s;te of the times. It contain|ed abundance of murder and gho&s;ts; a Spirit read a lecture on vice, and the &s;inner was at length car|ried away by the Devil.</P>
<P>I read this performance the fir&s;t Saturday after it was ready; and judge my raptures when after it was fini&s;hed, Mu&s;aeus pronounced tho&s;e words which I &s;hall never forget: "Well, very well! From what magazine have you taken this?" With what tri|umph did I reply, that it was my own compo&s;ition&punc; "Really!" an&s;wered Mu&s;aeus: "Bravo! go on." Nothing could exceed my tran&s;ports at this pa|negyric, and my poetic propen&s;ity was confirmed.</P>
<P>At this time of life every thing is imitation, and I am convinced that there is not a &s;ingle origi|nal idea in a man's head till he is of an age to pro|pagate his &s;pecies. Every thing I now made was only an imitation of the book I had la&s;t read. I wrote a comedy called All's Well that Ends Well, which I believe had a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the Count of Ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bach. Goethe u&s;ed to vi&s;it in our hou&s;e; he heard of my comedy, and was &s;o con|de&s;cending, or &s;o polite, as to a&s;k a reading of it. By this wi&s;h he highly gratified my mother; and this probably was his object, for I never heard more of the comedy. This able man, however, in my boyi&s;h days always treated me with great kind|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In my &s;ixteenth year I went to Iena. At fir&s;t my attention was principally directed to the acqui|&s;ition of the dead and living languages, and in both the&s;e my knowledge was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed. At Iena my partiality for the &s;tage &s;till continued. Before my arrival, there was a private theatre e&s;|tabli&s;hed among the &s;tudents, and it was one of my fir&s;t objects to be admitted into the a&s;&s;ociation. As it is not cu&s;tomary for ladies to appear in &s;uch theatres, on account of my youth female characters of the younger &s;ort were often a&s;&s;igned to me. My
<PB N="ix" REF="035693_0007_10064C60B0839DE0">
propen&s;ity for rhyming likewi&s;e continued, and I produced a number of poetic trifles.</P>
<P>In my eighteenth year I undertook to write a Romance, which I fini&s;hed. It con&s;i&s;ted of eight or ten &s;heets, and, in my own opinion at the time, was nothing inferior to Goethe's Werter. The &s;tory indeed was much more terrific; for my hero pre|cipitated him&s;elf from the top of a high rock, and was da&s;hed to pieces. This performance I &s;ent to the Weygand, then publi&s;her of mo&s;t fa&s;hiona|ble romances at Leipzie. After waiting &s;ome time, however, I had the mortification to receive an an|&s;wer from him, in which he told me that the manu&s;cript was at my &s;ervice, and de&s;ired me to order payment of the po&s;tage of it! I never, how|ever, inquired after it.</P>
<P>In the year 1779 I returned to Iena from the vi&s;it I had paid to my &s;i&s;ter then lately married, and applied with con&s;iderable zeal to the &s;tudy of juri&s;|prudence. I likewi&s;e attended the profe&s;&s;ors of hi&s;tory, logic, and metaphy&s;ics, and continued to improve my&s;elf in modern languages.</P>
<P>I this year produced a tragedy called Charlotte Trank, which was performed at our private theatre, and I my&s;elf enacted one of the principal cha|racters. The reception of it, however, was rather cold. Soon after I wrote a comedy, which was much better received, and, as far as I recollect, containing &s;ome tolerable comic touches. I like|wi&s;e in&s;tituted a poetic club, from which I derived con&s;iderable improvement.</P>
<P>In my nineteenth year I returned to Weimar, and &s;tudied the Pandects with great indu&s;try; was examined by the Government, and admitted Ad|vocate. While I waited for clients, I my&s;elf con|tinued a zealous client of the Mu&s;es. The &s;um|mer after my return I wrote &s;everal little things, which I am not now ambitious to recall into notice. I likewi&s;e wrote &s;ome Tales, which were publi&s;hed
<PB N="x" REF="035693_0008_10064C658D72DB18">
with my name by Dyk, at Leipzic, with an hun|dred and fifty pages by &s;ome other hand. Several little dramatic pieces were likewi&s;e the produce of my partiality for the theatre.</P>
<P>In 1781 I went to Peter&s;burgh. For &s;ome time I repre&s;&s;ed my turn for poetic pur&s;uits, but I again began occa&s;ionally to indulge my ruling propen&s;ity. There was a German theatre at Peter&s;burgh. It was then in a very indifferent &s;tate; but &s;oon after it was put in the number of the royal theatres, and the direction of it given to my friend General Bawr, of the artillery, a German. I now again found my&s;elf in my element.</P>
<P>I wrote a tragedy in five acts, called Demetrius Czar of Mo&s;cow. By a whim&s;ical circum&s;tance the repre&s;entation of this piece was nearly prohibi|ted. In the hi&s;tory Demetrius was by many call|ed an impo&s;tor. In my play I found it conve|nient to make him an hero. It turned out, how|ever, that there was an old proclamation of Peter the Great, in which this &s;ame Demetrius was de|clared to be an impo&s;tor. With much difficulty, however, the piece was allowed to be performed; after I had in a very formal manner been made to declare that I was perfectly &s;atisfied of the impo&s;ture of Demetrius, and the ju&s;tice of the proclamation, and that the freedom which I had u&s;ed in my play was merely a <HI>licentia poetica.</HI> I likewi&s;e wrote a comedy, called The Nun and the Chambermaid, which was performed with great &s;ucce&s;s. It was never publi&s;hed, and the copy of it was accidentally left.</P>
<P>In the year 1782, &s;ome of my friends who had influence at court propo&s;ed to procure me a place, and to facilitate their exertions I was reque&s;ted to write a &s;mall volume of Tales and Fables for young Princes, to be dedicated to the young Grand Duke. Though I felt no great call for &s;uch a ta&s;k, I com|plied;
<PB N="xi" REF="035693_0009_10064C67182C7A00">
and the volume was printed in a mo&s;t &s;uperb manner by the direction of one of my friends. Finding, however, that I was not qualified for this kind of writing, I re&s;olved, after the work had proceeded a con&s;iderable length, to repay the publi&s;her for his expence, and to bury the four &s;heets which were fini&s;hed in eternal oblivion.</P>
<P>Ye who &s;o often and &s;o loudly accu&s;e me of vanity, to my Fables I appeal as the proof of your fal&s;ehood! Their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion co&s;t me &s;ome hundred rubles, but my vanity not a &s;igh.</P>
<P>I now come to the period when I went to re&s;ide at Revel. Soon after this I wrote two plays, The Hermit of Formentera, and Adelaide of Wulfingen. The former was performed at a private theatre, and my propen&s;ity for the &s;tage revived. To this pro|pen&s;ity the people of Revel are indebted for a theatre, which for the la&s;t ten years has had an excellent company, and can boa&s;t of performers of no common merit. It was opened with a piece of mine, called Every Fool has his Cap. The piece bore a &s;triking re&s;emblance to Moliere's Mi&s;er, and I have buried it among my papers.</P>
<P>In autumn, 1787, I was &s;eized with a &s;evere illne&s;s, which for &s;everal years reduced me to a &s;tate between life and death; or, what is wor&s;e than death, a &s;tate of gloomy dejection of &s;pirits. In the very height of this malady I wrote Mi&s;an|thropy and Repentance, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Stranger.</NOTE> and &s;oon after The In|dians in England. Both of them were fini&s;hed within about eight or nine weeks. Never in my life, either before or &s;ince, did I feel &s;uch copiou&s;ne&s;s of ideas, &s;uch vigour of imagination, &s;uch fertility of diction; and I believe it to be undeniable that there are &s;ome kinds of maladies (among which may particularly be included tho&s;e which increa&s;e the
<PB N="xii" REF="035693_0010_10064C68A1A334C0">
irritability of the nerves) which elevate the powers of the mind to an unu&s;ual height; ju&s;t as, accor|ding to the &s;tory, a di&s;ea&s;ed mu&s;cle forms a pearl.</P>
<P>In the year 1790 I wrote The Virgin of the Sun, The Child of Love, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lover's Vows.</NOTE> and Brother Montz the Hu|mouri&s;t. I likewi&s;e proceeded in the collection of my &s;maller works.</P>
<P>Upon Mi&s;anthrophy and Repentance many fooli&s;h things were &s;aid and written at the time. Among other things, it was objected that it was defective in poetic ju&s;tice, becau&s;e, by an uncon|ditional forgivene&s;s, I had re&s;tored the criminal to the enjoyment of all the plea&s;ures of life. Whether any forgivene&s;s could completely remove the cruel puni&s;hment which her crime carried with it; whether &s;uch a woman as Eulalia, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Called Adelaide, or Mrs. Haller, in the play as performed here.</NOTE> with a con|&s;cience &s;o awakened, could ever again be happy, are que&s;tions which nobody thought it worth while to a&s;k, except Mr. Ziegler, who, however, took up the whole affair erroneou&s;ly, and by the unju&s;tifia|ble freedom of calling Eulalia's &s;educer from the dead, completely changed the nature of the ca&s;e. I therefore wrote The Noble Lie, in which, although certainly there appears a young lady fallen from virtue, a circum&s;tance on which the impure imagi|nation of Reviewers continues to dwell, unque&s;|tionably prevails the pure&s;t moral that ever was in|culcated from the pulpit or the &s;tage.</P>
<P>In 1790, I experienced one of the &s;evere&s;t di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence in the death of an amiable wife. Grief for this lo&s;s drove me to Paris, and the account of this excur&s;ion I publi&s;hed under the title of The Flight to Paris, This book was like|wi&s;e &s;everely attacked by &s;ome critics.</P>
<P>Full of indignation again&s;t the Pari&s;ians, of who&s;e exce&s;&s;es I had been an eye-witne&s;s, on my return
<PB N="xiii" REF="035693_0011_10064C6A2C35AC38">
to Mentz I wrote The Female Jacobin Club, a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rce not without &s;ome humour. My friend Huber, however, becau&s;e he happened to be of a different political creed from me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell &s;oul of it in the mo&s;t violent manner. Neverthele&s;s, however, de&s;poti&s;m is to me as hateful as to him, and this I te&s;tified &s;oon after in my Philo&s;ophical Sketch of Louis XIV. My publi&s;her at Stra&s;burgh &s;ent me the work in manu&s;cript, and the corre&s;pondence which I had with him on the &s;ubject was broken open before it reached me. I complained to our mini&s;ter at Frankfort on the &s;ubject, who took my &s;ide; but it was alleged at Mentz that the letters were open before they arrived there, and I never was able to learn who it really was who did me the honour to mi&s;take me for a &s;py, or a red-capped Jacobin. It &s;eems to be my fate, that while Mr. Huber and Co. exclaim again&s;t me as an advocate of de&s;poti&s;m, the de&s;pots around con&s;ider me as a dangerous de|mocrat, worthy of their mo&s;t jealous attention. I could give &s;ignal examples of this, if a man were at liberty to tell all he could.</P>
<P>Once in my life I had the weakne&s;s to write a book in complai&s;ance to another. It was the book on Nobility. I could &s;ay a great deal on this &s;ub|ject, but I am not at liberty to do it If the world knew&mdash;and perhaps they may one day know&mdash;into what equivocal reputation of a certain kind I have been thrown by the opinions, which both before and &s;ince I have expre&s;&s;ed, and which have been &s;o egregiou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented; if they know how my mo&s;t confidential private corre&s;pondence was turn|ed again&s;t me; if they knew what inducements I had, and from whom they proceeded, they would decide upon that production upon quite different grounds; they would take into view not only the author, but the citizen and the father. I confe&s;s, however, that my incon&s;iderate complai&s;ance laid
<PB N="xiv" REF="035693_0012_10064C6E13846620">
me open in &s;everal points to the attacks of critici&s;m; but for attack from tho&s;e with whom I had lived in habits of friend&s;hip, I was not prepared.</P>
<P>All that I have written &s;ince has been received by the public with approbation, and by the critics announced without approbation. The&s;e are, Count Benyow&s;ky, The Death of Rolla, The Younge&s;t Children of my Fancy, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under this general title the following Novel was fir&s;t pub|li&s;hed.</NOTE> Poverty and Honour, The Man of Forty Years, The Negro Slave, The Chace, The Count of Burgundy, The Defamers, Fal&s;e Shame, and La Peyrou&s;e.</P>
<P>Many of my plays have had the good fortune to be tran&s;lated into French, Dutch, Dani&s;h, Poli&s;h, Ru&s;&s;ian, Italian: <NOTE PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, when this was written, heard of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">untry.</NOTE> a new thorn in the &s;ide of the Reviewers! A few days ago I received the follow|ing piece of intelligence in a letter from Mo&s;cow: "Your play, The Child of L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve, was as often re|pre&s;ented, and with more applau&s;e here than The Marriage of Figaro in Paris. It is very well tran|&s;lated into Ru&s;&s;ian."</P>
<P>Is it not matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that at the &s;ame time, and in &s;o many countries, the Public &s;hould every where have judged wrong, and approved of things upon which the Reviews had pronounced irrevocable &s;entence of condemnation?&mdash;The inve&s;tigation of that phenomenon, however, I mu&s;t re&s;erve for the continuation of this article on &s;ome other occa&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. THE BOY.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM &s;at by the &s;ide of a brook under an alder tree. He had ju&s;t &s;lipped the bark from a willow branch, and formed it into a ru&s;tic flute. He &s;at and drew from his artle&s;s in&s;trument &s;imple, plaintive melodies; and now and then he would gaze upon the brook that babbled by, and weep bitterly. A few &s;teps from the banks of the rivulet lay his hat, and in the hat a piece of bread. The linnets and goldfinches hopped from twig to twig, approaching nearer and nearer, till at la&s;t they had the boldne&s;s to peek the crumbs out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t. William viewed them with a melancholy
<PB N="16" REF="035693_0014_10064C719B1C0488">
&s;mile, and &s;truggled to &s;uppre&s;s his &s;obs that he might not di&s;turb the little gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>"Why do you weep, my boy?" &s;uddenly cried a rough voice behind him.</P>
<P>"Why do you weep, my boy?" repeated a &s;weet tender echo. William &s;tarted, and blu&s;hed as if he had been caught in &s;ome criminal act. Mankind are a&s;hamed of a gift which te&s;tifies their noble origin. We are a&s;hamed to &s;hed tears. Nobody choo&s;es it &s;hould appear that he has been weeping. We pull out our handkerchiefs, and pre&s;s them to our red eyes, to wipe away the la&s;t traces of hu|manity.</P>
<P>William had not time to dry up the large drops which trickled over his &s;un-burnt cheeks. With his fine black eyes he gazed at the &s;trangers from whom the que&s;tion proceeded. Before him &s;tood a corpulent man, dre&s;&s;ed in a clo&s;e dark blue coat and a bob wig. In his right hand, which di&s;play|ed no common &s;ize, he carried a long Spani&s;h cane with a golden head, and in the left he led a beau|tiful girl of eleven years of age, on who&s;e ro&s;y cheeks the evening &s;un played through the trees, while the gentle zephyr wantoned in her fair flowing locks.</P>
<P>"Why do you weep, my boy?" repeated this benignant creature, and dropped a tear on the bunch of May-flowers which &s;he had newly plucked.</P>
<P>"Ah, Mi&s;s!" &s;aid William, as he ro&s;e from the ground where he &s;at, "I weep becau&s;e I know not what in the world will become of me."</P>
<P>"Are you an orphan?" &s;aid the corpulent man.</P>

<P>William &s;tared at the corpulent man; in his fine eyes it was ea&s;y to read&mdash;"I do not under&s;tand you."</P>
<P>"You do not under&s;tand me," proceeded the corpulent man; "and it were better that I did not under&s;tand my&s;elf.&mdash;How old are you?"</P>

<P>&mdash;Then, indeed, are you too young and too weak to pur&s;ue your father's occu|pation.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;I am extremely willing to work, but then I &s;hould forget all I have learnt at &s;chool. I u&s;ed always to think with my&s;elf that I ought to be diligent and attentive, for it was po&s;&s;ible that I too might one day come to be a &s;choolma&s;ter, and be able to provide for my old father when is no longer able to carry burdens.</P>
</SP>
<P>"Give him &s;omething, father!" li&s;ped the little Mi&s;s as &s;he clung round the corpulent man, and looked up to him with eager, &s;parkling eyes. When &s;he found that her father did not immediately an|&s;wer, &s;he added, in querulous accents, "This too, is my birth-day, and you have yet made me no pre&s;ent."</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="035693_0016_10064C77BA2DFF48">The good old man was touched; with a compla|cent &s;mile he chucked her tenderly under the chin, and &s;aid to William, "Dry up your tears, my boy; I will pay the expence of your education at &s;chool. Come to-morrow morning early with your father to my hou&s;e, and we will talk farther upon the bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>William ha&s;tily &s;eized the corpulent man's right hand, and bathed it with his tears; the little girl ki&s;|&s;ed the left; the old man was affected. William gave his flute to the little girl. She accepted it, kindly nodded her head, and in return gave him the bunch of May-flowers. Not a word pa&s;&s;ed between them; but the young Mi&s;s viewed the flute with compla|cency, and William pre&s;&s;ed the May-flowers to his heart.</P>
<P>"Farewell till to-morrow!" &s;aid the corpulent man as he went away, and the little girl tripped gaily by his &s;ide through the willows. William followed her with his eyes. She frequently looked behind, and every time with a kindly nod, till a hillock concealed the lovely angel from his view. William took up his hat, crumbled the piece of bread, and &s;cattered it on the gra&s;s for the linnets and goldfinches. He then &s;tuck the bunch of May-flowers in his hat with more pride than a young cornet his fir&s;t cockade, and went home in the highe&s;t &s;pirits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP II. THE FIRST VISIT.</HEAD>
<P>HE that goes to bed with his head full of the idea that to-morrow he has &s;omething of great importance before him, commonly awakes betimes. Scarce was it day-break, when William &s;tood before a &s;hattered looking-gla&s;s to prepare for his vi&s;it. He powdered his hair, and &s;pared no pains to deck out his locks in the neate&s;t &s;tyle. A ro&s;e-coloured coat, of pretty fine &s;tuff, but now worn thread|bare, which three years before had been purcha&s;ed from an old-clothes-man, and con&s;equently now much too &s;hort at all points, this day received a new decoration from the half-faded bunch of May-flowers, which William had fa&s;tened upon his brea&s;t with two large corking pins.</P>
<P>Old John Meadows &s;pread a towel upon his &s;houlders, and pulled the bra&s;s comb at lea&s;t twenty times through his clo&s;e-cropped hair. From the che&s;t, which he ever kept locked with religious care, he drew out his Sunday's coat of dark blue cloth, and his &s;carlet wai&s;tcoat. It was trimmed &s;uperbly from the &s;houlders down to his thighs; his clean &s;hirt was mo&s;t carefully plaited, and di&s;played innu|merable folds. A dark cane with an ivory head waved in his hand by a leathern thong, and a hat with three huge cocks covered his head.</P>
<P>Thus proudly arrayed, they bent their way to the hou&s;e of the corpulent man; and as they paced along, old John Meadows thanked God in &s;ilence, who had in&s;pired the heart of a heretic to a&s;&s;i&s;t William honorably through the world.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="035693_0018_10064C7B08E11240">What! and the corpulent man then was an here|tic?</P>
<P>Yes, courteous prote&s;tant reader! yet was he no political, but only a theological heretic; and at this time of day &s;uch a thing has cea&s;ed to be a crime. The cut of your religion and of your clothes, the form of your creed and of your hair, are now &s;ubjected to the omnipotent &s;ceptre of Fa|&s;hion; and Voltaire, who was once bani&s;hed from his country becau&s;e he ventured to &s;tart the impi|ous doubt whether Adam and Eve in Paradi&s;e had their navels cut,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Mondain.</NOTE> would now have been driven back to his country becau&s;e he makes Titus exclaim&mdash;

<P>Mr. Jerome, whom the inhabitants of the little country town of L * * *, by an ea&s;y corruption, u&s;ed to call <HI>Skrum,</HI> was a French emigrant&mdash;driven from his native land, however, neither by the revo|cation of the edict of Nantes, nor by the violence of the National Convention. He had left the country of his ance&s;tors in pur&s;uit of fortune, becau&s;e &s;he had not chanced to vi&s;it him at home. He was a &s;taunch, thorough Roman catholic; by trade a &s;tocking-manufacturer, a calling he had exerci&s;ed for twenty years, during which he had been &s;ettled in Germany. Here by a pair of fine eyes his con|&s;cience was &s;o overcome, that he was fain to accom|modate it to the wi&s;hes of his heart, as he fa&s;hioned his &s;tockings to an&s;wer every &s;ize of foot, great or &s;mall. In other words, he had ventured to marry a prote&s;tant heretic, who, however, for the puni&s;h|ment of her mi&s;belief, died in childbed a year after their union, leaving him an only daughter, who was called <HI>Jeanette</HI> by her father, and <HI>Jenny</HI> by the re&s;t of the family.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="035693_0019_10064C7C92BD93B0">Mr. Jerome was corpulent; but when a wretch|ed fellow-creature laid his hand on Mr. Jerome's brea&s;t, he felt his heart beat loud and kindly enough. He was of a cheerful di&s;po&s;ition; well he loved a laugh, heartily enjoyed a gla&s;s of Burgundy, de|lighted in the &s;ocial circle, but mo&s;t of all when his morning had been employed in performing a kind and beneficent action. Benevolence, indeed, is the parent of gaiety, and the cheerful man is ever more ready than the gloomy and moro&s;e to draw his pur&s;e to relieve a brother.</P>
<P>The doors in&s;tantly fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w open when John Mea|dows and his &s;on were announced. Mr. Jerome was &s;moking a pipe of tobacco, and Jeanette was &s;oaking a roll in tea: be&s;ide her cup lay the flute. She nodded benignantly to the giver, who returned her &s;alutation with awkward bows, and blu&s;hed till his cheeks vied in colour with his father's wai&s;t|coat. She looked at the flute, and then at William, as if &s;he meant to &s;ay, "Do you &s;ee how much I value your pre&s;ent?" William &s;tood with down|ca&s;t eyes, and played with the May-flowers, as if he would have an&s;wered&mdash;"Nor is yours le&s;s dear to me."</P>
<P>John Meadows broke &s;ilence. He &s;poke at great length of the Chri&s;tian temper, and of God's ble&s;|&s;ing. He even ventured to maintain, that the man who protected and &s;upported the poor orphan might, in &s;pite of his corrupted faith, be placed among the &s;heep on the right hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Jerome &s;miled with much good-nature, and glanced at his tobacco &s;moke as it rolled up in &s;preading volumes, as if he would have &s;aid, <HI>&s;moke</HI> or <HI>cloud,</HI> it is all one in the end.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall be very happy," &s;aid he with a gentle inclination of the head, "if the young lad continues to be diligent and well-behaved. I will pay the ex|pence of his education at &s;chool, and take care like|wi&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="035693_0020_10064C7F654C2438">
that he &s;hall not want any thing nece&s;&s;ary to his progre&s;s. Let him attend the precentor of the pari&s;h church two hours a week to learn to &s;ing, as I under&s;tand he has a mind to be a &s;chool-ma&s;ter. He may come here every day, and dine with the &s;uperintendant of my manufactory upon what Provi|dence is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow. I &s;hall then have an op|portunity of hearing what progre&s;s he makes. A|dieu! the table is always covered at two o'clock."</P>
<P>"Now, William, mind what you are about!" muttered his father, pinching his &s;on's arm! "go and ki&s;s this worthy gentleman's hand!"</P>
<P>Heaven knows from what feeling it proceeded, but William ba&s;hfully walked up with trembling &s;teps to the tea-table, and ki&s;&s;ed Jeanette's hand. Jeanette blu&s;hed as red as &s;carlet. John Meadows &s;aid: Blockhead! and Mr. Jerome laughed. "Be not di&s;plea&s;ed, good John! The lad has done quite right, &s;ince what I now do to a&s;&s;i&s;t him he owes ori|ginally to my daughter."</P>
<P>With many bows which no dancing-ma&s;ter would have endured, and many cordial ble&s;&s;ings which God and the worthy old man's heart accepted, the happy pair took their leave. William, at fir&s;t, in compliance with the dictates of politene&s;s, was about to withdraw to the door, carefully ob&s;erving always to pre&s;ent his face to the company. Vani|ty, however, whi&s;pered him to turn round, that the pretty little girl might have an opportunity of &s;eeing his finely dre&s;&s;ed and powdered hair. He wheeled abruptly round therefore, and with head erect he marched out of the room.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. THE PEAR-TREE.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM continued to advance in &s;tature; he learnt to write, to read, to ca&s;t accounts, to &s;ing, and had Luther's &s;maller catechi&s;m at his finger's ends. Jeanette likewi&s;e improved in &s;ize, and learnt even more than William. When they were together, however, they were wont to forget what they had learnt. William dined every day with Mr. Jerome's over&s;eers. Frequently upon Sundays he was invited to his benefactor's table, as he was a well bred, mode&s;t lad. On the&s;e occa&s;ions he never forget to drink the healths of the whole company, and generally had the misfortune to &s;pill a few drops of wine on the table-cloth, becau&s;e, in making the circuit of the gue&s;ts, his hand trembled whenever his eye lighted on Jeanette.</P>
<P>Every year William celebrated Mr. Jerome's birth-day in a poem in <HI>Ale andrines,</HI> a yard long, elegantly tran&s;cribed upon royal paper, &s;titched up in morocco with blue &s;ilk. Jeanette's birth-day was likewi&s;e &s;ung with equal honor, but in <HI>dactyls</HI>; and in&s;tead of blue &s;ilk, the binding was ornament|ed with purple red. The father, on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, rewarded him with a guinea, and the daughter with a kind glance. The guinea dropped into his pocket, the glance went to his heart. The guinea he u&s;ually carried to his father, and not a halfpenny did he retain for him&s;elf; the glance he would not have &s;hared either with father or mother. He felt &s;omething like the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation as the young gen|tlemen of London when they a&s;cend Dr. Graham's cele&s;tial bed.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="035693_0022_10064C83B4E7F200">Of the mo&s;t delightful of all feelings, man is una|ble to give the lea&s;t account, becau&s;e, prai&s;ed be the great Creator! they are original in&s;tincts in his na|ture. Envy, hatred, &s;lander, and all the furies which compo&s;e the black catalogue of vice, are, at a later period, the ba&s;tard brood of the &s;ocial &s;tate. W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am had never reflected why he employed pur|ple &s;ilk for Jeanette, nor examined for what rea&s;on, at the &s;ight of her, his heart leaped like his own dac|tyls. Neither did Jeanette know why at noon, ju&s;t at the time when William came to dinner, &s;he was &s;ure to &s;eat her&s;elf at the door. As little did &s;he reflect why upon Sundays, in helping about the &s;oup, &s;he never failed to give William the large&s;t &s;hare of the <HI>bouilli.</HI> It proceeded doubtle&s;s from this cau&s;e, that, without our ever &s;u&s;pecting it, in the fir&s;t part of our life we are ripening for love, as in the latter part of it we are ripening for death. Love and death have many things in common. No mortal can defy their power. Both come upon us by &s;urpri&s;e, like a thief in the night; both tran&s;port us in Ely&s;ium. A dying man and a lover re&s;emble each other in this too, that the &s;pectators generally di&s;cover before the per&s;on him&s;elf, what is his real &s;ituation. Fortunately this was not the ca&s;e with William and Jeanette. Mr. Jerome never dreamt that Jeanette could ever forget in the amiable youth, poor William the porter's &s;on; or that William would ever a&s;pire to the daughter of a manufactur|er. He did not con&s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r that liberty and equality is the great my&s;terious law in love as in death.</P>
<P>When the light down began to &s;pread it&s;elf on William's upper lip, and Jeanette's bo&s;om began to extend, Cupid, the mi&s;chievous boy, with cunning artifice prepared by various little incidents to unra|vel that web which, with playful hand, he had wove in their infant hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="035693_0023_10064C85A0A00918">Mr. Jerome, who was univer&s;ally con&s;idered a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of property, among other things po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a gar|den in front of his hou&s;e, where, in a fine &s;ummer evening, he was wont to enjoy him&s;elf. Hither u&s;ed William to come after he had hara&s;&s;ed his mem|ory all day long, or had &s;ung him&s;elf hoar&s;e with the pari&s;h clerk, in order to refre&s;h him&s;elf with new milk and vegetables.</P>
<P>One harve&s;t day Jeanette happened to long for a pear, which hung deliciou&s;ly tempting on the top of a branch. William in&s;tantly proceeded to climb the tree. The wi&s;h to gratify her was combined with the little vanity of &s;howing with what &s;peed and adroitne&s;s he could mount the highe&s;t tree; for it is a delightful &s;en&s;ation to extort admiration from tho&s;e we love. He &s;oon a&s;cended the trunk, and lightly &s;wung from branch to branch.</P>
<P>"William! William! you will fall," cried the old man from the bower. "There is no danger," re|turned William carele&s;sly, and &s;tretched out his hand to &s;eize the tempting fruit. As his arm, how|ever, was too &s;hort, in leaning forwards he lo&s;t his balance, tumbled, gra&s;ped a rotten branch; the branch broke, and William fell to the ground like a piece of lead.</P>
<P>Jeanette &s;creamed. "There it is!" cried the old man, and waddled up in all ha&s;te quite breath|le&s;s. In the fall the &s;plinter of the branch tore the thoughtle&s;s boy's temple. "William!" cried Jea|nette with trembling voice; "William! you bleed!"</P>

He was immediately laid upon a barrow, conveyed home with all po&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s, and lodged in Mr. Jerome's hou&s;e, where he was attended with the utmo&s;t care for &s;ix weeks.

<P>"How are you now?" &s;aid &s;he one day at the beginning of the &s;eventh week. "Alas!" &s;aid William in a querulous tone, "I am well, and the happie&s;t of my days are flown!"</P>
<P>"You dream dear William. Have you not lain con&s;tantly in bed, and endured the mo&s;t violent pain?"</P>
<P>"Ah! how &s;oon was it forgotten when I &s;aw Jeanette enter the room!"</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, he concealed his glowing coun|tenance with the bed-clothes; and Jeanette, over|&s;pread with the mo&s;t captivating blu&s;hes of mode&s;|ty, pretended &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s at the window; in do|ing which &s;he awkwardly overturned three phials with medicines. Of the&s;e, however, there was &s;tore remaining. The &s;urgeon declared what Wil|liam of his own free impul&s;e would never have an|nounced, that his patient was completely cured. William, with a deep &s;igh, left the hou&s;e in which his heart had enjoyed more delightful emotions than his leg had co&s;t him painful hours. Winter cover|ed with &s;now the garden in front of the hou&s;e, and the glimmering &s;parks of fir&s;t love. Jeanette and

William &s;aw each other le&s;s frequently, and, when they met, they were con&s;trained by an embarra&s;&s;|ment which they had never before experienced.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the youth received the mo&s;t flattering te&s;timonies from his in&s;tructors. "He is dili|gent," &s;aid they, "and he has talents; it is a pity indeed that he is &s;ometimes a dreamer. For hours together he will &s;it with open mouth, and gaze. Do you call him, he does not hear; do you &s;hake him, he &s;tarts up in amaze! and do you a&s;k him what he has been thinking of, the common an&s;wer is: Of <HI>nothing.</HI>"</P>
<P>I know very well what I am thinking of, would William whi&s;per a&s;ide to him&s;elf; I know well of what I dream, but I cannot impart it to you.&mdash;Jea|nette felt &s;ome kind of &s;entiment, as if &s;he knew likewi&s;e; but it was a &s;ubject which &s;he was &s;till le&s;s qualified than William to mention.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. THE CANARY BIRD.</HEAD>
<P>SOON as the &s;pring again awaked every bud to life, and every bird to love, Mr. Jerome began to vi&s;it his garden. There would Jeanette often &s;it under the fatal pear-tree, and wonder that her bo|&s;om, which was now &s;o much enlarged, &s;hould feel even more confined than when &s;he wore frocks. With the frocks of childhood its joys too had flown. La&s;t harve&s;t the pear-tree was intere&s;ting only on account of its fruit, but now &s;he preferred the blo&s;|&s;oms. Formerly &s;he delighted to &s;ee the linnet
<PB N="28" REF="035693_0026_10064C8DB6D0D258">
with his clipped wings hop through the room, but now &s;he would rather li&s;ten to his &s;ong in the groves. <HI>Childhood</HI> loves to demoli&s;h; <HI>youth</HI> to enjoy; <HI>manhood</HI> wi&s;hes to build up, and to repair, but in the mid&s;t of its &s;chemes is &s;urpri&s;ed by <HI>old age,</HI> which loves to lie down beneath a ruin, and doze away the re|mainder of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Out of the abundant trea&s;ure of her youthful joys, Jeanette had nothing now remaining but a fa|vorite canary bird, which, by the help of a violin, had been taught to &s;ing the melodies of the &s;ong, <HI>"Marlborough's to the wars gone.</HI>" He would often fit upon her &s;houlder, and peck the &s;ugar from her mouth. As her father and this canary were the on|ly living creatures &s;he could venture to acknow|ledge, either to her&s;elf or to others, that &s;he pa&s;&s;ion|ately loved, &s;he &s;oon became per&s;uaded that little <HI>Marlborough</HI> was indi&s;pen&s;ible to her. "I &s;hould fret to death," would &s;he often &s;ay, "were he to die." This in other words meant, "I cannot live without love, and I know not yet how ea&s;y it is to &s;upply the place of a canary bird."</P>
<P>One hot &s;ultry &s;ummer day it happened&mdash;and William chanced to be in the garden&mdash;that all the windows of the hou&s;e were thrown open to invite the breeze, which gently waved the vine-leaves that arched round the window. While little Marl|borough hopped at liberty through the room, the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of his great ance&s;tor &s;uddenly began to move in him. Perhaps he was enticed by the twit|tering of a &s;parrow on the out&s;ide, which reminded him, that in &s;pite of his golden plumage, and his pre&s;ent delicate &s;tyle of living, he was originally &s;prung from the &s;parrow race. He re&s;olved, there|fore to teach the courtier a le&s;&s;on, by conde&s;cending to acknowledge his humble relation. Pre&s;to! in a moment he was out at the window, and Jeanette had well nigh leaped out after him. She &s;tood with
<PB N="29" REF="035693_0027_10064C8FA6114CE0">
uplifted arms, and &s;creamed as if &s;he had &s;een &s;ome|body murdered below in the garden.</P>
<P>It was long before the cau&s;e of her &s;creams could be a&s;certained, &s;ince nobody had ob&s;erved the little fugitive, and Jeanette was &s;o frightened that &s;he could not for her life &s;tammer out the word <HI>Marl|borough.</HI> William &s;tood before her, moved his lips, twi&s;ted his fingers, and with anxious looks &s;eemed labouring to draw the words from her mouth. When he at la&s;t learnt what was the matter, he took the &s;horte&s;t way out at the window; and Jeanette was on the point of following him, had not female delicacy in the critical moment pulled her by the &s;leeve, and held her back. She flew out at the door, and &s;oon joined William, who&s;e eyes wander|ed from tree to tree.</P>
<P>"There he &s;its!" cried he at la&s;t, pointing to a cherry-tree, where Marlborough perched, and devoured with keenne&s;s a May cherry. "But how are we to entice him down without frightening him away?"</P>
<P>William whi&s;tled; Jeanette cried, but all in vain! A lump of &s;ugar was &s;hewn him at a di&s;tance; but he eyed it a&s;kance, like a contented pea&s;ant who is invited to the table of a prince, and yet would eat his buttermilk at home with much greater plea&s;ure and appetite. After the little fugitive had pecked the cherry to the &s;tone, he flew merrily away, like the favorite of &s;ome great lady, who is compelled to give the tone to the feelings of his mi&s;tre&s;s, though his heart refu&s;es to beat in uni&s;on, and at la&s;t has the good fortune to fall into di&s;grace. His pur&s;uers followed him clo&s;e. He then perched up|on a birch, and the feelings of liberty appeared quite to overcome the duty of gratitude; for he took not the lea&s;t notice of Jeanette's fond, enticing complaints.</P>
<P>William was preparing to climb the birch, but Marlborough &s;aved him the trouble, and flew from
<PB N="30" REF="035693_0028_10064C9440345E40">
tree to tree. At la&s;t he flew over the hedge into the adjoining meadows. Without wings, and in &s;pite of the thorns, William &s;oon contrived to find his way over the hedge. Poor Jeanette, however, was obliged to remain behind, and content her&s;elf with her tender hands to make a little opening in the thicket, through which &s;he could have a pro&s;|pect of the meadow, and at lea&s;t follow the beloved fugitive with her eye.</P>
<P>"Ah! William! William! get me him back" cried &s;he to the youth with a voice &s;o touching<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;weet, that he would have pur&s;ued the bird into the very cage of the fairy <HI>Strigillina,</HI> for who&s;e acquaint|ance we are indebted to the facetious <HI>Cazotte.</HI> The meadow was but thinly planted with trees, and at the di&s;tance of a few hundred paces was bounded by a river of con&s;iderable breadth, though not very deep. On the banks of this &s;tream Marlborough perched on a willow, &s;o low, that he &s;eemed ea&s;ily within reach. William &s;lipped up upon tiptoe, and when he was opening his hand&mdash;away the little fu|gitive took his flight acro&s;s the &s;tream, &s;at down upon an a&s;pen tree, and began to &s;ing merrily&mdash;not <HI>Marlborough's to the wars gone</HI>&mdash;but the &s;ong which nature had taught him without the help of an in|&s;trument. It is thus that we all do. Every one has his piece which he has learnt by rote, and he &s;ings it no longer than he is obliged. The par&s;on drones it from the pulpit, and at home re&s;igns him|&s;elf to the &s;pirit of the cloth, while he calculates the amount of his tythes.</P>
<P>There was no time to be lo&s;t. William &s;prang forward into the water without con&s;ideration, clothes and all, waded up to the &s;houlders, and &s;afe|ly gained the oppo&s;ite bank, but not the object of his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Jeanette through the hedge &s;aw what William had done, and the big tear of angui&s;h which rolled
<PB N="31" REF="035693_0029_10064C95CA474190">
down her cheek changed into the &s;ilent &s;tealing tear of tenderne&s;s. She trembled &s;till, but it was not for Marlborough. "Kind William!" &s;aid &s;he aloud: "Dear William!" &s;oftly re-echoed her heart.</P>
<P>He had now, together with the bird, di&s;appeared from her view. He leaped and &s;prang over hedges and ditches, keeping the runaway favourite con|&s;tantly in &s;ight. His &s;trength now began to fail; his breath was nearly exhau&s;ted; the agitation of his brea&s;t was vi&s;ible; the moment &s;eemed at hand when he would be compelled to drop down with fatigue, and the re&s;u&s;citated Marlborough would be abandoned to his fate.</P>
<P>Unexpectedly a third party now came into ac|tion, who, unob&s;erved, had long watched his advan|tage. A hawk &s;oared in air, lurking like a villain that prowls abroad to ruin innocence. Ah! that nature had not be&s;towed upon man the in&s;tinct of the feathered creation, to detect wickedne&s;s and trea|chery at a di&s;tance, when they &s;eem to hover care|le&s;s over him without menacing de&s;truction! Little Marlborough, in his golden pri&s;on, had never &s;een a hawk, but nature di&s;tinctly told him&mdash;"Above you there is your foe!" What neither &s;educing love nor tempting dainties could accompli&s;h, fear at la&s;t effected. He &s;haped his flight lower and low|er; at la&s;t, but ju&s;t above the &s;urface, he perched upon a juniper bu&s;h&mdash;the hawk darted down&mdash;and Marlborough leaped for refuge into William's pro|tecting hand.</P>
<P>"I have got him!" cried William panting for breath; "thank God, I have got him." He for|got that his &s;trength was exhau&s;ted; he thought only of Jeanette's tran&s;ports, and the idea in&s;pired him with new vigor. He could not allow him|&s;elf to think of going round by the high road over the bridge, and through the town to Mr. Jerome's
<PB N="32" REF="035693_0030_10064C97585CC548">
garden. With the bird in his hand he leaped more lightly than before over all the hedges and ditches which &s;eparated him from Jeanette; with the bird in his hand he plunged again into the river, and held his captive over his head.</P>
<P>"I have got him!" exclaimed he, when he &s;aw the white robes of his beloved waving through the hedge. A tender tear &s;tole down her cheek when &s;he at la&s;t &s;aw William &s;tanding before her breath|le&s;s, drenched to the &s;kin, his hands torn and bloo|dy, his face inflamed and di&s;coloured, his hair as wet with per&s;piration as his clothes with water. She darted an animated glance which betrayed her whole &s;oul; &s;he forgot Marlborough and her di&s;ordered morning gown, &s;uddenly threw her&s;elf round his neck, and with loud &s;obs ki&s;&s;ed his glowing cheek.</P>
<P>Poor William, indeed, had earned well his re|ward. He was &s;o much exhau&s;ted that he could not even return Jeanette's care&s;&s;es. He &s;unk down on the gra&s;s, and panted for breath; Jeanette could not &s;peak her thanks&mdash;&s;he was &s;ilent; but this mo|ment decided the fate of her life. William was re|que&s;ted to go to town and change his clothes. He would not go. Next morning he was &s;eized with a fever and ague.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. LOVE FOR LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>THE cunning boy Cupid claims an indi&s;putable right to inhabit every dam&s;el's heart. Should you knock and inquire whether he is within, and

This cele&s;tial divinity too has it in common with the gods of the earth that he &s;ubmits to the tyranny of favorites, provided they never fall into di&s;grace with him. Gentle reader! do you gue&s;s the names of the&s;e favourites? They are called <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Sen&s;e.</HI> Love, indeed, has al&s;o a <HI>friend,</HI> le&s;s a favorite, as u&s;ual, it is true, than the flatter|ers, but often po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t influence.

<P>William, without being aware of it, had &s;uc|ceeded in intere&s;ting both the friend and the flatter|er in his favor. As early as the day when his tears dropped into the brook, and the flute breathed the &s;imple tones of his plaintive melody, <HI>Pity</HI> fir&s;t &s;tole into the gentle bo&s;om of Jeanette. The broken leg of la&s;t year nouri&s;hed this feeling, and the ague now lent it incalculable &s;trength. Hence was formed the triple alliance to which we have ju&s;t alluded. Vanity whi&s;pered in &s;oothing accents: "For thy &s;ake it was he climbed the tree; for thy &s;ake he plunged into the river."&mdash;<HI>Sen&s;e</HI>&mdash;Fy! fy! what has an innocent girl of &s;ixteen to do with the &s;ugge&s;|tions of <HI>Sen&s;e?</HI></P>

to you as a crime?&mdash;William was a tall hand&s;ome &s;tripling; he had the glow of health upon his cheek; his countenance di&s;played the fre&s;h bloom of youth; he had a fine intelligent eye, purple lips, white teeth&mdash;Is it my fault that nature has communica|ted to the&s;e qualities the power to plea&s;e? When all is done, mu&s;t we not exclaim with Boufflers:
<Q><L>Que deviendroient les familles,</L>
<L>Si les coeurs des jeunes gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons</L>
<L>Etoient faits comme ceux des filles?</L></Q></P>
<P>The very &s;ame apartment where la&s;t year Willi|am had found his health but too &s;peedily re-e&s;tab|li&s;hed, was on this occa&s;ion likewi&s;e the &s;cene of his joys and &s;ufferings. He entered it with delightful warmth of emotion, to which the &s;hivering fit of his di&s;temper was for a moment forced to yield.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the whole day Jeanette was wont to &s;it by his bed-&s;ide. Her father troubled him&s;elf little about the matter, partly becau&s;e the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;pi|cion never entered his imagination, and partly be|cau&s;e his affairs, for &s;ome time fallen into di&s;order, occupied his attention, and &s;oured his temper.</P>
<P>Jeanette had learnt botany from an old French|man, a pupil of <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau,</HI> and inherited from her mo|ther a number of notable receipts. She liked to dabble a little in medicine too, and &s;he re&s;olved to undertake in per&s;on the cure of her beloved patient; a de&s;ign, in which &s;he very probably would have ul|timately &s;ucceeded without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any re|ceipts whatever. Sometimes &s;he prepared for him fre&s;h decoctions of cre&s;&s;es, borage, and other herbs; again &s;he would give him mint leaves with honey; and &s;ometimes &s;he made him drink coffee with lem|on juice. William, without reluctance, &s;wallow|ed whatever her fair hand pre&s;ented to him; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d it plea&s;ed her to pre&s;cribe it, he would have drank coloquintida without making a wry face&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="035693_0033_10064C9F34AC8328">When he at length perceived that the fever had left his body, but that his love for Jeanette was not likely to be &s;oon expelled from his heart, he became pen&s;ive and melancholy. Jeanette daily made ten|der and pre&s;&s;ing inquiries after the cau&s;e; but in vain! no decoction could loo&s;en his tongue. Mo&s;t willingly indeed would he have rolled away the heavy burden that lay upon his heart, but where could he find courage for the attempt?</P>
<P>"Ba&s;hful boy! when love is deficient in cou|rage, it has recour&s;e to art. You dread Jeanette's re&s;entment? Why, well! Try then to di&s;cover your love without betraying the de&s;ign. Have you not a fever? Cannot you affect delirium? The ra|vings of a di&s;tempered fancy &s;he cannot take ami&s;s."</P>
<P>Something, <HI>I know not what,</HI> whi&s;pered the&s;e &s;ug|ge&s;tions to William's heart, and to its &s;oothing ac|cents William lent a willing ear. Several days he revolved his little plan of impo&s;ture, and watched only for a favorable opportunity to put it in prac|tice.</P>
<P>One evening Jeanette amu&s;ed him in reading the celebrated <HI>Reinecke Fuchs,</HI> which M. Goethe has dre&s;&s;ed out in a new garb. He was &s;o wearied with the pranks and the jokes of ma&s;ter <HI>Reinecke,</HI> that he had abundance of time to &s;tudy his part. Twenty times was Jeanette, yawning with fatigue, on the point of laying the book a&s;ide; but as William was &s;ilent, and his eyes, &s;teadily fixed upon her, &s;eemed to indicate that he was intere&s;ted in the &s;tory, &s;he concluded that it mu&s;t be very entertaining, though &s;he could not comprehend it. She continued to read on to the ninth canto, and kept her&s;elf from &s;leep as well as &s;he could. She was at the place which &s;ays that the "hero <HI>boldly</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to all the barons," when the word <HI>boldly</HI> &s;truck William's ear, and vibrated to his heart. "Why do you he&s;itate?" whi&s;pered Love; "take cou|rage!
<PB N="36" REF="035693_0034_10064CA0C5167D80">
be <HI>bold!</HI>"&mdash;Here, however, it was no barons that William had to deal with; and he would have thought it far ea&s;ier to addre&s;s him&s;elf to all the barons in Chri&s;tendom, than to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the offended looks of Jeanette.</P>
<P>Suddenly William began to to&s;s him&s;elf about in bed, and to utter unintelligible jargon. Jeanette looked up: "William, are you not well?"&mdash;He returned no an&s;wer. Jeanette repeated her que&s;|tion, and William &s;till refu&s;ed to an&s;wer. Alarmed, &s;he threw away the book, ro&s;e, leant over him, and gazed upon his countenance with inqui&s;itive looks. His cheeks glowed&mdash;and that appeared a &s;u&s;picious &s;ymptom; his brow was hot&mdash;it was a return of the fever; his eyes rolled&mdash;he breathed quick&mdash;&s;he was &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed. Silent and anxious &s;he &s;tood be&s;ide him to watch the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>William now began to give loo&s;e to his tongue: "Jeanette!" exclaimed he without turning his eyes towards the place where &s;he &s;tood, "my belov|ed Jeanette!" Then he proceeded to talk enthu&s;i|a&s;tically of palaces and cottages, which he would inhabit with his Jeanette. Now he would &s;uppo&s;e that he &s;aw Mr. Jerome before him; with tears he entreated and conjured him not to refu&s;e him Jea|nette becau&s;e he was poor. Now he thought he &s;aw her in the arms of another; then wept and raved, complained and &s;tormed.</P>
<P>Jeanette was terribly frightened. She attempted to run away, but did not go; &s;he was about to cry for help, but &s;he did not. William's ravings were &s;o intere&s;ting that they fixed her whole attention, and the confe&s;&s;ion of his love &s;he heard with rap|ture, as his &s;ituation &s;pared her blu&s;hes.</P>
<P>After the pretended &s;ick man had played his part for a con&s;iderable time with great &s;ucce&s;s, and had unveiled the mo&s;t &s;ecret wi&s;hes of his heart with|out embarra&s;&s;ment, he &s;unk down upon the bed as
<PB N="37" REF="035693_0035_10064CA2E0013108">
if exhau&s;ted, and peered at Jeanette with half-&s;hut eyes, in order to a&s;certain the effects of his talents for theatrical performance. His &s;inking down ap|peared to Jeanette to be a &s;woon; and when he gazed &s;teadily at her, &s;he thought that his eyes were &s;et in his head. Away &s;he ran to the window, where &s;tood a phial with cordial drops, took a cup, and intended to pour out twenty; there were at lea&s;t eighty however, partly becau&s;e her hand trem|bled, and partly becau&s;e &s;he reckoned as much out of rule as if &s;he had in her life heard no more of addition or multiplication than of <HI>Kant's</HI> Critici&s;m on pure Rea&s;on. Had this cordial been applied as it was intended, the rogui&s;h patient would indeed have &s;u&s;tained no injury; for on the way between the window and the bed her trembling hand had &s;pilt four parts of the potent drug. With the re|mainder &s;he approached the patient's lips, and with &s;oothing accents &s;aid, "My dear William!"&mdash;At the&s;e words, in&s;tead of the cup he &s;eized her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it ardently to his mouth, and gazed upon her with langui&s;hing &s;oftne&s;s.</P>
<P>"You will &s;pill the drops!" cried Jeanette con|founded. But the drops were already &s;pilt. Wil|liam troubled him&s;elf no more about them; he threw his arms round the lovely girl, hid his face in her bo&s;om, and &s;tammered, "Forgive me, Jea|nette, I do not rave!"</P>
<P>"What is the matter with you, William?"</P>
<P>"Alas! I am poor! I have nothing but a heart that dotes upon you!"</P>
<P>"You are &s;ick!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"O yes! to death if you di&s;dain me!"</P>
<P>It was indeed an excellent, though a very danger|ous fa&s;hion among the old Germans, which a&s;&s;ign|ed to the fair &s;ex the practice of the healing art. What extraordinary cures might not in tho&s;e days a young hand&s;ome baggage have performed! How
<PB N="38" REF="035693_0036_10064CA6A40B5738">
often, on the other hand, might &s;he not have been the victim of her humanity! How often has the patient been cured when the phy&s;ician caught the di&s;temper!</P>
<P>Jeanette felt that &s;he had more occa&s;ion for the cordial drops than William. She would have run out of the room, but &s;he wanted &s;trength to di&s;en|tangle her&s;elf from his arms. She would have chid, but &s;he wanted breath to &s;peak, as William's glow|ing lips were pre&s;&s;ed to hers. At this moment the <HI>juggler</HI> Cupid, with inconceivable dexterity, exchang|ed their hearts; and &s;howed them, by the help of a little of his Necromantic &s;kill, in&s;tead of a yawn|ing aby&s;s under their feet, a di&s;tant pro&s;pect of flow|ery fields and beds of ro&s;es.</P>

no apprehen&s;ions for the future. On account of the coincidence which we have mentioned, it is u&s;ual to call lovers childi&s;h, drunk, or mad; and I have nothing to &s;ay &s;hould the reader be inclined to apply the&s;e honorable appellations to the princi|pal per&s;onages of my &s;tory; for it was <HI>childi&s;h</HI> at their age to permit love to &s;teal into their hearts; it was <HI>intoxication</HI> to acknowledge their mutual at|tachment; it was <HI>madne&s;s</HI> to dream of future bli&s;s.</P>
<P>William's mo&s;t ambitious hopes &s;carcely a&s;pired &s;o high as the rank of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter. Jeanette, indeed, thought that love ennobled every &s;tation, and con&s;tituted the happine&s;s of the beggar as well as the prince. She already anticipated in imagina|tion how &s;he would feed the hens and gee&s;e, and bake cakes at Chri&s;tmas. Even the difference of their religious faith gave her no unea&s;ine&s;s. Lovers have only one religion.</P>
<P>William thought the&s;e &s;entiments extremely well founded, and did not fail to add many other rea&s;ons no le&s;s conclu&s;ive. If a warlike prince, would he argue, returns his &s;word into the &s;cabbard to repo&s;e in the arms of his confort, why 'tis the &s;ame thing exactly when the &s;choolma&s;ter lays down the rod and embraces his helpmate. The prince adorns his brows with laurel, and the &s;choolma&s;ter at Whit|&s;untide decorates his apartment with birch. The laurel is dyed with blood, but the birch &s;heds a &s;weet perfume.&mdash;Love delights to amu&s;e it&s;elf with &s;uch companions. The imagination admits them with|out &s;cruple; but as with infants, who thru&s;t every thing indi&s;criminately into their mouth, it is &s;oon di&s;covered that &s;ome things will not go down.</P>
<P>William, who&s;e fever had now taken a different turn, appeared endued with &s;upernatural powers &s;ince Jeanette's lips had been pre&s;&s;ed to his. His ma&s;ters no longer called him dreamer. He was

the mo&s;t attentive, the mo&s;t &s;tudious &s;cholar in the &s;chool. He acquired every branch of knowledge with extraordinary expedition, and never lo&s;t &s;ight of the object of his exertions, the valuable prize for which he &s;truggled. He now learnt more in &s;ix months than formerly in as many years; and at a public examination, in pre&s;ence of the &s;uperintend|ant-general <HI>Hori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iophilius,</HI> he made &s;o favorable an appearance, that notwith&s;tanding his youth he re|ceived the appointment of &s;choolma&s;ter at <HI>Walldorf,</HI> a &s;ituation of no contemptible emolument.</P>
<P>Prouder than a cardinal who has received from the vi&s;ible head of the church the right to wear a purple robe, and to lead a great white hor&s;e by a golden bridle; happier than a &s;hipwrecked naviga|tor, who for many weeks has defied the attacks of hunger and thir&s;t in a crazy canoe, and at la&s;t de&s;|cries a friendly South Sea i&s;land at hand, on who&s;e coa&s;ts the bread-tree invites him to allay his hunger; prouder and happier did Wiiliam now &s;ly home to revive his &s;ick father with the news.</P>
<P>Good old John Meadows was not de&s;tined to enjoy the fruits of his &s;on's indu&s;try and preferment, for he died a few weeks after. To the day of his death, however, he continued to amu&s;e him&s;elf with a hundred little plans how he &s;hould &s;pend an ea&s;y old age, how he &s;hould &s;uperintend the kitchen|garden and the orchard, or undertake the manage|ment of the &s;chool upon occa&s;ion, when urgent bu|&s;ine&s;s took his &s;on to town In the mid&s;t of the&s;e flattering dreams John Meadows fell a&s;leep&mdash;the happier for him, perhaps!

<P>It may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed that William, on being inve&s;ted with his new dignity, immediately after communicating his good fortune to his father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied away to Mr. Jerome's hou&s;e. Before he &s;et

<P>"I am extremely happy to hear it," &s;aid Mr. Jerome; "God ble&s;s you, my &s;on!" Jeanette's cheeks glowed with tran&s;port; and &s;he could &s;carce re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;e to throw her&s;elf round his neck, and ki&s;s the beloved youth. The word <HI>&s;on,</HI> which her father had employed, awaked in her mind a train of &s;miling images.</P>
<P>William was invited to &s;tay dinner. He &s;at in &s;peechle&s;s joy; he could not eat a bit, and &s;atisfied him&s;elf with fea&s;ting his eyes; and when the old man poured out a gla&s;s of wine, and kindly &s;aid, "Your health, Mr. Meadows!"&mdash;the tears bur&s;t into Jeanette's eyes; &s;he was obliged to ri&s;e from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able on pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It is a good old practice to drink healths. It is indeed the mo&s;t in&s;ipid thing in the world when it is merely a piece of ceremony in a polite company.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. PATIENCE!</HEAD>
<P>A FEW days after this joyful incident, death &s;ummoned &s;ome half-dozen princes and lords to the other world, and by the &s;ame conveyance di&s;patched likewi&s;e John Meadows the porter, there to be interrogated, by a more penetrating examiner than the &s;uperintendant-general <HI>Hori&s;tophilius,</HI> how each of them had borne his burden through life, and whether they had dragged it without &s;tumbling from the cradle to the grave?</P>
<P>After William had dropped a tear of filial piety upon his father's grave, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his whole inheritance, con&s;i&s;ting of the blue Sunday's coat and the &s;carlet wai&s;tcoat, he departed in good &s;pirits for Walldorf. He found on his arrival a delightful country; a ho&s;pitable man&s;ion, inhabited by a good old lady, the widow of the decea&s;ed &s;choolma&s;ter; a kitchen-garden and orchard, a bower formed of honey&s;uckles and je&s;&s;amines; a piece of arable land, a &s;mall meadow, an hone&s;t pea&s;antry, and a worthy clergyman! All, all ex|ceeded his wi&s;hes and his hopes. Happy as a child, he made his little dome&s;tic arrangements in the gaiety of a benevolent heart. His arri|val had alarmed the old widow of his predece&s;|&s;or, as &s;he was afraid that &s;he would be thru&s;t out of the little cottage, in which for more than thirty years &s;he had lived in peace. Her fears were groundle&s;s. "You may live in my hou&s;e, mother!"</P>
<P>William, "till death &s;ummon you hence, and God may perhaps provide in the &s;ame manner for my widow when I am gone." He thought of Jeanette. She is unacquainted with the manage|ment
<PB N="43" REF="035693_0041_10064CB142244760">
of a family, and the old woman will teach her both by her advice and example. The old woman under&s;tands cookery as well even as the par&s;on's wife; and when I bring home the bride, &s;he will treat us with a di&s;h of pancakes, which I know Jeanette dearly loves. Then &s;hall we dine in the honey-&s;uckle bower, and after dinner &s;hall I lead her through the fields, and &s;how her all our riches. In the orchard are pears, and as good too as tho&s;e for which I broke my leg; and in the kitchen-garden are &s;allads, which little Marlborough will reli&s;h &s;weetly.</P>
<P>With thoughts like the&s;e did William nightly lull him&s;elf to &s;leep, till he had fairly &s;ettled in his new habitation; and according to his opinion, every thing was properly dre&s;&s;ed out and prepared for the reception of the bride. One Morning then, with anxious beating heart, he &s;at out for town, and, as he went, conned over a &s;peech, which was quite to overwhelm Mr. Jerome; every word of which however, he forgot the moment he laid his trembling hand upon the door of the room. "Hah! welcome, Mr. Meadows!" cried the old man when he entered, "how goes it with you?"</P>

<P>Jeanette drew in her breath, and li&s;tened behind the door. Her bo&s;om heaved with agitation, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> alone prevented her from being mi&s;taken for &s;tatue.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="035693_0042_10064CB2CE587858">"Ah! Mr. Jerome," proceeded William with trembling voice, "what &s;hould I do with riches? The art to be rich is the art to have few wants, and thank God I am content. The daughter of a far|mer, or a beggar, it is all one if my wife loves me."</P>

<P>&mdash;Dear Mr. Jerome! you are my benefactor! you have rai&s;ed me from nothing, and made me a man&mdash;Complete your work!&mdash;Give me Jeanette to wife!</P>

<P>"What! what! are you out of your wits?" &s;aid Mr. Jerome, and the pipe dropped from his mouth.</P>
<P>William &s;eized the old man's hand, devoured it with ki&s;&s;es, and bathed it with his tears as he &s;tam|mered the words: "Jeanette loves me!"</P>
<P>"This is very ab&s;urd in you," &s;aid Mr. Jerome, after he had a little recovered from his &s;urpri&s;e; "very childi&s;h and thoughtle&s;s in both of you. I am indeed no friend of old-fa&s;hioned whim&s;ies, but order mu&s;t &s;till exi&s;t in the world. Every one &s;hould match with his equal.

In &s;hort, my friend, I can forgive you for hankering after Jeanette; for you are young, and &s;he is a hand&s;ome baggage: but I hope you will give up all ideas of matrimony, and never return the benefits I have conferred upon you with ingratitude."</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t time in &s;even years that Mr.
<PB N="45" REF="035693_0043_10064CB480B7B740">
Jerome had dropped a hint of the word benefit; &s;o it went the more &s;everely to poor William's heart. "Ingratitude!" &s;aid he, while his quiver|ing lips drank up the falling tear: "No! God pre&s;erve me from that crime! Befall me what may, God pre&s;erve me from ingratitude!"&mdash;He &s;queez|ed his hat between his hands, looked to heaven, his eyes bedewed with tears, and exclaimed: "I may be wretched, but never ungrateful!"</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he &s;taggered to the door. The old man was affected. A compa&s;&s;ionate emotion pleaded the cau&s;e of his adopted &s;on; but rea&s;on interfered, and prote&s;ted with deci&s;ive voice: "it mu&s;t not be!"&mdash;So he bade him go in God's name.</P>
<P>When William opened the door, Jeanette lay upon the thre&s;hold and &s;obbed. From the thre&s;h|old &s;he crept to her father's feet. She could not &s;peak, but her eyes &s;poke a language which her father's heart under&s;tood. Mr. Jerome was obliged to &s;ummon up all his firmne&s;s to with&s;tand its dumb eloquence. He &s;truggled, and was victorious; for the good man's oppo&s;ition to the marriage was founded neither upon regard to rank, nor to the catholic religion, but upon rea&s;ons which he was a&s;hamed openly to avow.</P>
<P>High living, indolence, and di&s;hone&s;t &s;ervants had &s;quandered his means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and for &s;ome time pa&s;t he had been meditating &s;ome &s;cheme for repairing his fortune. The ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t commodious appeared to be to marry his daugh|ter to a rich young trade&s;man who had lately &s;et|tled at L***, and &s;eemed to be much attached to Jeanette.</P>
<P>The world talks a great deal of prejudice, and yet in nine in&s;tances out of ten it is only the cover for human actions. Intere&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion are the &s;ecret &s;prings of the machine, and prejudice is only

<P>THERE are a number of virtues of which we are unable to form any ju&s;t e&s;timate. A number did I &s;ay?&mdash;Perhaps all!&mdash;Climate, con|&s;titution, and age here form a &s;aint, and there a villain. If the Indian, who&s;e fruitful &s;oil returns his increa&s;e an hundred-&s;old, is more beneficent than the native of Findland, who mu&s;t draw his &s;canty bread from the rugged rock, in what does the &s;uperior merit of the former con&s;i&s;t? When Boileau preaches cha&s;tity, becau&s;e a cold-blooded tutor had in his boyi&s;h years taught him to be a woman hater, in him it is no virtue. And if Mr. Jerome, in the &s;ixtieth year of his age, &s;hould prac|ti&s;e the patience which he recommends, he is indebt|ed for it to the &s;ober temperament of his blood, which no longer darts rapidly through his veins, but creeps on in a &s;low and ea&s;y current.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of youth is compo&s;ed of <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> and of <HI>hopes</HI>; that of the old man, of <HI>habits.</HI> Wi&s;hes and hopes, the youth may change or renew; but

the old man clings to his habits like an oy&s;ter to his &s;hell; tear him from his habits, and he dies. Mr. Jerome felt that an ea&s;y life, a well covered table, and a gla&s;s of good wine, were become in|di&s;pen&s;ible to him. William was unable to &s;up|ply him with the&s;e, and accordingly he per&s;i&s;ted re&s;olutely in his refu&s;al.</P>
<P>William and Jeanette parted as life parts from youth, with &s;truggles and convul&s;ions. "Alas! had fate but ordained me to be a porter!" exclaim|ed William, as he tore him&s;elf away. "Even then &s;hould I have loved you!" returned Jeanette in a voice almo&s;t &s;tifled with &s;obs. In vain her father employed every means to divert the atten|tion of the doting maid. He took her out to the garden&mdash;but there lay William under the pear-tree!&mdash;He walked with her in the meadows&mdash;there &s;prang William into the river!&mdash;He invited com|pany&mdash;but among them at table &s;he &s;till &s;aw the image of William!&mdash;He pre&s;ented her with new dre&s;&s;es&mdash;but for whom &s;hould &s;he now adorn her per&s;on? Her hair remained uncurled; her flow|ers were no longer tended; and poor Marl|borough was almo&s;t &s;tarved. She exchanged her apartment for that where &s;he had nur&s;ed William in his &s;ickne&s;s. There &s;he would &s;it upon the bed where fir&s;t he had encircled her in his arms; there &s;he would rivet her&s;elf to the ground where the fatal drops he had &s;pilt yet &s;tained the floor.</P>
<P>William returned to his village with a &s;tern in|difference to every thing that is called mankind and the world. The good old dame at home ob&s;erved with &s;orrow, that he gave to the dog the &s;avoury pancakes &s;he had &s;o carefully prepared for his en|tertainment. He went out to the fields, and &s;mi|led when he &s;aw that the vermin had de&s;troyed the green &s;hoots of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orn.

<P>In this temper of mind, he proceeded with ha&s;ty &s;teps to the village.

William, the once tender, kind-heart|ed William, ever ready to comfort and to relieve, now did not think it worth his pains to inquire the cau&s;e of her &s;orrow. "What can be the matter?" thought he. "She has perhaps been robbed, or her cow-hou&s;e has been burnt down. Poh! a trifle!" He was pa&s;&s;ing on.</P>

The old dame looked at him with a&s;toni&s;hment, and twenty times a&s;ked him what he meant, but received no an&s;wer. In the evening the &s;ergeant whi&s;tled. "Farewell! good mother!" &s;aid William, and threw his bundle over his &s;houlder.</P>
<P>"Gracious God! Where are you going? and &s;o late in the afternoon too?"</P>
<P>"Go to &s;leep in peace, good mother! When the morn &s;hall dawn in <HI>that place</HI> where merch|ants and &s;choolma&s;ters, catholics and prote&s;tants, awake together, we &s;hall meet again!"&mdash;The old lady under&s;tood him not. She looked after him till the hawthorn hedge concealed him from her &s;ight. She &s;hook her head, waddled away to a neighbour, with whom &s;he puzzled her brain till midnight in vain, to conjecture what could have befallen the &s;choolma&s;ter.</P>

command a view of the place of William's nativity. William di&s;tinctly di&s;covered the top of the hou&s;e in which Jeanette lived. The garden before the door appeared quite plain to his &s;ight, and he thought that he could even di&s;tingui&s;h the fatal pear-tree.</P>
<P>Hitherto he had followed his conductor in gloo|my &s;ilence. Neither words nor &s;ighs had betrayed the &s;ufferings of his heart. Now he &s;uddenly &s;topped, as if rooted to the &s;pot on which he &s;tood, &s;tretched out his arms towards the place of his na|tivity, and wept bitterly.</P>
<P>"Courage!" &s;aid the &s;ergeant. "Though you were to &s;pend twenty years in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, the town wont &s;tir an inch from its place.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A NEW CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>WERE it not incon&s;i&s;tent with the re&s;pect which I entertain for what is called <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> I would &s;ay, that the &s;oul &s;ometimes re&s;embles a &s;prained joint&mdash;you cannot touch it without cau|&s;ing violent pain. Often, however, a little &s;troking by a &s;kilful hand is &s;ufficient to re&s;tore every mu&s;|cle to its proper tone. Accident led the &s;ergeant to quote a few words of <HI>Schiller</HI>'s &s;onnet to <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>William had the &s;ong completely by heart; every line ru&s;hed into his memory, and every one bore the &s;tamp of perfection; every one irre&s;i&s;tibly rou&s;|ed his &s;oul to heavenly emotions. I know no hu|man ills for which this exqui&s;ite poem will not afford a cordial drop of con&s;olation. Ble&s;&s;ings on the poet's head who wrote it! Once in a dreary hour it revived me!&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ings on his head!" exclaimed William, as a beam of hope dawned in his brea&s;t, and a &s;park of courage awoke in his &s;oul.</P>
<P>William, with moi&s;tened eyes, ca&s;t a parting look at his father's grave, the beloved pear-tree, and the ivy mantled roof of Mr. Jerome's hou&s;e. With ha&s;ty &s;trides he darted down the hill, and felt a kind of &s;atisfaction when he found that it
<PB N="53" REF="035693_0051_10064CC799639A70">
concealed the la&s;t &s;pires of the town from his view. <HI>Satisfaction</HI> do you &s;ay?&mdash;Certainly. As long as a man can gra&s;p at a beloved image with the &s;mall|e&s;t probability of reaching it, he is more wretched than when the la&s;t ray of hope vani&s;hes from his brea&s;t. As often as William &s;aw, in the blue ho|rizon <HI>behind</HI> him, the hill which the preceding day he had de&s;cried in the blue horizon <HI>before</HI> him, as often as he cro&s;&s;ed a river, and &s;aw the flying bridge again removed behind him, he felt as if his heart was ever collected more firmly within it|&s;elf; the &s;torm in his &s;oul was &s;ilent; and if he did not enjoy tranquility, yet the tempe&s;t had cea&s;ed to rage.</P>
<P>Very naturally, the &s;ergeant, in this expedition, became his confidante. Communication is indi&s;pen|&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to a lover; and had no human ear been open to William's melancholy tale, he would have &s;tolen a dog in the fir&s;t village he came to, and made him the partner of his &s;orrows. William's companion, indeed, was no &s;uch rough fellow as his fierce whi&s;kers and his &s;tern voice &s;eemed to indicate. He had left a wife and a child at home. He loved to talk of war and battles; but he loved &s;till better to talk of his dear Nancy, and his fine boy at her brea&s;t. The man who combines affec|tion for a virtuous wife and a &s;en&s;e of dome&s;tic happine&s;s can never be hard-hearted. Patiently he li&s;tened to the complaints of his love-&s;ick recruit, or at lea&s;t &s;eemed to li&s;ten; and that was enough for William.</P>
<P>After &s;everal days journey they arrived at the place of their de&s;tination, a fortre&s;s upon the fron|tiers, where the recruits were a&s;&s;embled, and the new levies in&s;tructed in military &s;ervice. The &s;o|briety, regularity, attention, and rapid progre&s;s of the young man &s;oon gained the regard of his &s;upe|riors. With ea&s;e he acquired dexterity in the man|ual
<PB N="54" REF="035693_0052_10064CCBB416C720">
exerci&s;es of his new profe&s;&s;ion. He was &s;tea|dy and correct in his conduct, and never was in|volved in any unplea&s;ant adventures. He wrote a fine hand, and in&s;tructed his captain's children in the rudiments of education. By the&s;e means he gained univer&s;al love and re&s;pect; and even the wilde&s;t of his comrades entertained no animo&s;ity again&s;t him, as he pretended no call to the office of a preacher of morality&punc; and never interfered to damp their plea&s;ures. There was one, however, more at|tached to him than the re&s;t; and this was preci&s;ely the mo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated among them.</P>
<P><HI>Frederick Perl&s;tadt,</HI> the &s;on of a collector of the revenue, combined with an open generous heart a very &s;prightly di&s;po&s;ition. When a boy he u&s;ed to tea&s;e and torment his ma&s;ter by his mi&s;chievous tricks, and was inexhau&s;tible in wanton &s;allies of waggery. Sometimes he would fa&s;ten a hook to the venerable peruke of the &s;choolma&s;ter, and whip it off, to the infinite entertainment of his compani|ons. Sometimes he would &s;ew together the &s;kirts of his &s;choolfellows' coats, or &s;tick their heads be|tween the &s;pars of the benches, as if they &s;tood in the pillory. Neither admonition nor the rod was &s;pared for the good of his &s;oul, but the latter &s;uc|ceeded wor&s;e than the former. His father, who had been &s;everal years a widower, was di&s;po&s;ed to overlook his boyi&s;h tricks; and perhaps every thing would have gone &s;moothly with him, had not his evil genius cur&s;ed him with a &s;tep-mother.</P>
<P>Truth demands the confe&s;&s;ion, that &s;ometimes good &s;tep-mothers may be found; they are very rare, however, like hone&s;t divines. Such a rarity the French call <HI>belle mere</HI>; the common &s;tep-mother they &s;tyle <HI>mar&acirc;tre,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Step-mothers <HI>(les mar&acirc;tres)</HI> de&s;olate cities and villages; and, no le&s;s than poverty, they people the earth with beggars, vaga|bonds, dome&s;tics, and &s;laves.&mdash;<HI>Characters of La Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yere.</HI></NOTE> a very &s;ignificant and energetic

phra&s;e, for which the poverty of our language has no corre&s;ponding term. Frederick's pe&s;t was a <HI>mar&acirc;|tre.</HI> She hated the wild boy from the bottom of her &s;oul, and every childi&s;h waggery &s;he a&s;cribed to a rooted bad di&s;po&s;ition; every thoughtle&s;s, youthful extravagance &s;he imputed to a vicious and corrupted heart. His wildne&s;s daily increa&s;ed; and as no debt on earth is more faithfully repaid than that of hatred, he returned his &s;tep-mother's animo&s;ity with &s;ilent dete&s;tation. Wherever he found an opportunity to do her a mi&s;chief, he was &s;ure to &s;eize it. His u&s;ual enterpri&s;es of ho&s;tility were to throw &s;ugar into the cream; to catch rats and mice; and then &s;et them loo&s;e in her bed-room; to place a number of beetles under her pillow, to keep her from &s;leeping. By this conduct he eter|nally di&s;turbed the peace of the family; and his father was daily more and more &s;pirited up again&s;t him, till his &s;tep-mother began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of getting rid of the gracele&s;s youth.</P>
<P>One day &s;he was to &s;tand godmother to the child of &s;ome per&s;on of con&s;equence. For this fe&s;tival &s;he had brought out of her wardrobe a &s;plendid white dre&s;s, which was carefully &s;pread out upon the &s;ofa. Frederick &s;aw it and chuckled. He went and brought into the room a large tabby cat, which had the bad cu&s;tom of con&s;idering the mo&s;t valuable things of no more importance than the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s. The cat was laid on the middle of the gown, and the con&s;equences an&s;wered Frede|rick's mo&s;t &s;anguine expectation.&mdash;At la&s;t, however, the &s;torm which had long been gathering over his head, bur&s;t.</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible to live any longer with Frede|rick," &s;aid the &s;tep-mother; "either he or I mu&s;t leave the hou&s;e!"</P>
<P>"But where &s;hall he go?"</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="035693_0054_10064CCF5D4BB5C8">"It is no matter to me! I will no longer live under the &s;ame roof with him. Is not the ra&s;cal big enough? Why, let him be a &s;oldier. I'll war|rant the mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will &s;oon drive the mi&s;chief out of his head."</P>
<P>Frederick laughed; his &s;i&s;ter wept and prayed; his father made &s;ome feeble objections, but in vain. The irre&s;i&s;tible decree of his &s;tep-mother was pro|nounced, and before a month elap&s;ed Frederick was a fu&s;ilier in the celebrated regiment of <HI>O&s;tein.</HI></P>
<P>But the mu&s;ket did not drive the mi&s;chief out of his head. Without being guilty of any very crimi|nal exce&s;&s;es, he &s;till continued, as formerly, a wild, thoughtle&s;s fellow, ever ready to knock his head again&s;t the wall, and in danger of being betrayed by his impetuous temper into trouble&s;ome &s;crapes. It is difficult to &s;ay what &s;uch a temper, with a mind totally neglected and uncultivated, would have led to, had not chance brought a company of players to his native town. With this intellectual plea|&s;ure he was altogether unacquainted. By the help of a few &s;hillings, with which the &s;avings of his &s;i&s;ter enabled her to &s;upply him, he had &s;ometimes an opportunity of going to the theatre. The <HI>Grate|ful Son</HI> was the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ece which he &s;aw repre&s;ented. It made a wonderful impre&s;&s;ion upon him. He laughed and wept. They were the fir&s;t tears of &s;entiment which he had &s;hed. He was a&s;hamed of them, and was &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed at the delight|ful &s;en&s;ations which they produced.</P>
<P>This moment, however, decided the nobler cha|racter of his &s;oul. He was not, indeed, all at once changed into a new mortal, Still he was &s;ome|times hurried away by his impetuo&s;ity, and indulg|ed his di&s;po&s;ition to wild and boi&s;terous enjoyments. There were periods, however, in which he ta&s;ted the plea&s;ure of reading. There were moments in which he peru&s;ed <HI>Don Quixote</HI> and <HI>Tom Jones</HI> with
<PB N="57" REF="035693_0055_10064CD108B04228">
delight; and at la&s;t he began to reli&s;h <HI>Don Carlos</HI> and <HI>Oberon.</HI></P>
<P>It was at this aera that the hero of this hi&s;tory became Frederick's companion, and the books which William received from him, and read over and over with &s;o much rapture, formed the fir&s;t links of their acquaintance. It was yet a &s;lender tie, but time gave it &s;trength. The di&s;&s;ipated Frederick &s;ome|times followed the prudent coun&s;els of his &s;ober friend; could not help entertaining a kind of re&s;pect for his judgment, and profited by his &s;ociety. Wil|liam, too, would &s;ometimes gratify Frederick by joining his &s;ocial parties; and often by his pre&s;ence prevented many follies and quarrels which &s;o natur|ally ari&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> among the votaries of Bacchus. In a word, William de&s;cended to Frederick, and Frede|rick elevated him&s;elf to William. He daily di&s;cov|ered in the unexplored regions of his heart new de|licate emotions; his judgment every day became more correct, his &s;oul more refined; and in a &s;hort time, of all his youthful foibles nothing remained but his ardent temper and impetuous &s;pirit; quali|ties which, if they do not con&s;titute a virtuous man, at lea&s;t are more compatible with goodne&s;s of heart than in&s;idious coldne&s;s and frigid equanimity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. THE MURDERER.</HEAD>
<P>IN this way of life two years had now elap&s;ed. William had never received any intelligence from home, nor did he wi&s;h for any. What indeed
<PB N="58" REF="035693_0056_10064CD522B99278">
could he expect to hear from &s;uch a quarter?&mdash; That Jeanette had married &s;ome rich re&s;pectable hu&s;band? That now, perhaps, &s;he was a mother?&mdash; Melancholy news! ungrateful ever to a lover's ear. William carefully avoided meeting any body from the neighbourhood of his native place; and was even afraid to read the new&s;papers, from a fear of finding Jeanette's marriage announced. Still he continued to love Jeanette beyond every one in the world; and, to tell a &s;ecret, Frederick Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tadt would not &s;o ea&s;ily have gained his friend&s;hip, had he not chanced to have a &s;i&s;ter who was like|wi&s;e called Jeanette. It was not that his &s;i&s;ter her|&s;elf could ever have gained an intere&s;t in his heart. He had not the lea&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee her, though fre|quently invited by Frederick to accompany him to vi&s;it her. It was enough for him to know that his friend too was affectionately attached to a creature called Jeanette. On this account, he delighted to hear him talk of her; and whenever the word Jea|nette was mentioned, William nodded benignantly, as if he would &s;ay: "I too have a &s;i&s;ter called Jeanette."</P>
<P>The ince&s;&s;ant activity of his &s;ituation alone pre|vented William from falling a victim to the melan|choly of this la&s;ting hopele&s;s love. The lei&s;ure hours which the &s;ervice allowed him were employ|ed in the in&s;truction of &s;ome children, and in the cultivation of his own mind. It was but &s;eldom that his gay friend could contrive to draw him from his books to roam abroad. The weather mu&s;t have been very inviting, and the heavens very &s;erene in|deed, if William con&s;ented to accompany Frederick in his excur&s;ions. When he did &s;o, however, he could be extremely cheerful in his way; for his &s;orrows were never &s;o inten&s;e, but that the beauties of Nature were able, at lea&s;t for a moment, to &s;ooth his mind to tranquillity.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="035693_0057_10064CD6B0438B88">One delightful May-day Frederick came and per&s;uaded William to accompany him in a walk to a neighbouring village. They went, and &s;trolled along in friendly chat between two blooming haw|thorn hedges. Near the village, where they inten|ded to drink a gla&s;s of beer, another &s;oldier, called <HI>Frank Moritz,</HI> joined them. This Moritz was a peevi&s;h, ill-natured fellow, con&s;tantly &s;eeking quar|rels and taking offence. When he had drank a gla&s;s of brandy too much, he fell on friend and foe, like <HI>Huber</HI> the reviewer; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A critic who has frequently fallen foul of our author's writings.</NOTE> and if you could not get out of his way, you were obliged either to take no notice of him at all, or compelled to cane him.</P>

<P>The two friends fell into one another's arms. There was no time now for much reflection. The danger required an immediate re&s;olution. Every moment they might be &s;urpri&s;ed be&s;ide the corp&s;e. Delay would render flight more difficult. William exerted all his eloquence to convince Frederick that regard for his parents and relations, on whom his di&s;grace would redound, impo&s;ed it on him as a duty to allow his friend to fly. He did not con|vince, but he &s;ilenced him. Alas! Frederick, the involuntary murderer, was already &s;o confounded, that he knew not what he did. Weeping, he put his pur&s;e into the hand of the generous youth&mdash; &s;peechle&s;s, he pre&s;&s;ed him to his heart. William tore him&s;elf away.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. THE PRIEST.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a fugitive with a few &s;hillings in his pocket, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a good action in his heart, gra&s;ps the beggar's &s;crip with more joy and &s;atisfaction than the crowned rob|ber his &s;eeptre&mdash;O God! can man demand from thee a &s;till farther reward for that conduct which, in the moment it is performed, &s;o richly rewards it&s;elf? About the clo&s;e of day William heard three guns fired, and &s;oon after the &s;ound of bells in the neighbouring villages. He knew that he was the object of pur&s;uit, and he concealed him&s;elf in a ditch under a bridge that cro&s;&s;ed a river on the high-way. Over the bridge in a &s;hort time he heard the trampling of the hor&s;es of the hu&s;&s;ars who were &s;couring the country in &s;earch of him. He did not quit his hiding-place till darkne&s;s favour|ed his flight. Although he was unacquainted with the road, he knew that he was near the fron|tier; and after he had travelled on as fa&s;t as he was able for two hours, a crucifix appri&s;ed him of his &s;afe arrival on a foreign &s;oil, as the adjoining country was catholic.</P>
<P>Wearied with his journey, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e threw him&s;elf up|on the gra&s;s to re&s;t him&s;elf. He had not laid long before the purple morn announced the coming day, and at a little di&s;tance he di&s;covered a village, in which he re&s;olved to &s;eek an a&s;ylum till the evening, &s;ince even in a foreign territory he dur&s;t not, for fear of the hue and cry, venture to pur&s;ue his journey during the day. "That church &s;pire
<PB N="64" REF="035693_0062_10064CE2160177F8">
before me," thought he, "is a proof that there is a clergyman in the village. He is not of my per&s;ua|&s;ion, to be &s;ure, but humanity dwells among all religions; Jeanette, too, was a catholic. If I tell him candidly the circum&s;tance, which compels me to fly, he will not refu&s;e me a corner of his hay|loft till it grow dark."</P>
<P>Having formed this re&s;olution, he entered the village, and knocked at the prie&s;t's door. A win|dow opened, out of which locked a chubby round head with the clerical ton&s;ure. A pair of &s;mall &s;quinting eyes peered with gracious looks over his red bloated cheeks, and played on his pur&s;y double chin.</P>
<P>"What do you want, my friend?" &s;aid the fat prie&s;t to the fugitive.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h to &s;peak a word in private with your rev|erence."</P>
<P>"A little patience, and I will open the door."</P>
<P>The ro&s;y prie&s;t drew in his head, &s;hut the win|dow, came to the door with &s;ilent &s;teps, and open|ed it without noi&s;e. William now &s;aw that the head was only a model of the belly, which, if ano|ther Jonah had been doomed to be thrown into du|rance, and no whale at hand, would have been able to contain a couple of prophets. That fat men may be generous and beneficent, William had al|ready experienced, nor was he &s;taggered in his opin|ion by the tun-bellied figure of the little prie&s;t.</P>
<P>Kindne&s;s, however, is of two &s;orts. The one is like the du&s;t on a butterfly's wings; men's faces are only powdered over with it. The other bears the rich colour of an autumn fruit; it indicates full maturity and exqui&s;ite flavour; it refre&s;hes the thir&s;ty. When men &s;mile, and &s;mile whenever you addre&s;s them; if they are always &s;mooth and &s;im|pering, the kindne&s;s of &s;uch men is only farmed; it is not their <HI>property.</HI> From a lea&s;e-hold it is u&s;ual
<PB N="65" REF="035693_0063_10064CE3F4E077F0">
to draw as much advantage as po&s;&s;ible; while the proprietor alone has a real regard for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without continually planning how he is to draw &s;ome profit from it. The little fat prie&s;t farmed his kindne&s;s, and it brought him annually large &s;ums from his pari&s;hioners. He looked with the &s;ame gracious &s;mile on the bride and bridegroom whom he married, and on the poor &s;inner whom he re|proved when doing penance before the congregation.</P>
<P>William had not &s;ufficient &s;kill in the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy to determine whether the kindne&s;s of his ho&s;t bore the &s;tamp of the heart, or of cu&s;tom. With courage and calmne&s;s, &s;ince he was no crimi|nal, William informed the prie&s;t of his difficulties, who li&s;tened to him without altering his counte|nance.</P>
<P>"Very well, my &s;on," &s;aid he with a &s;oft and gentle voice; "follow me without apprehen&s;ion." He conducted his gue&s;t to a loft, which was form|ed by a partition of boards, and &s;hewed him a bun|dle of hay for his bed.</P>
<P>"It is probable you have wandered about all night, and will require repo&s;e. Here nobody will di&s;turb you. At dinner time, I my&s;elf will fetch you a ba&s;on of broth, and whatever kind Providence may &s;end. When it is dark you may, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, proceed on your journey. Two leagues hence lies a market-town, the mayor of which is my friend. I will give you a recommend|ation to him that you may procure a pa&s;&s;port, for without a pa&s;&s;port you will find it difficult to pro|ceed. I advi&s;e you likewi&s;e, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to exchange your uniform for a pea&s;ant's jacket."</P>
<P>William, affected and tran&s;ported by this active and voluntary attention, ki&s;&s;ed with ardent expre&s;|&s;ions of gratitude the fat hand of the prie&s;t. "I thought indeed," &s;aid he to him&s;elf after he was alone, "that a religion which Jeanette profe&s;&s;es
<PB N="66" REF="035693_0064_10064CE8A53CDA28">
mu&s;t teach humanity." Free from all care and ap|prehen&s;ion, he &s;unk down upon the new-gathered hay, and &s;lept &s;weetly for &s;everal hours. When he awoke about noon, the prie&s;t &s;tood before him with a ba&s;on of broth, a &s;lice of bread and bacon, and a bottle of beer.</P>
<P>"Here, my friend, take this and refre&s;h your|&s;elf. There al&s;o is the letter to the mayor. I ad|vi&s;e you, however, not to quit my hou&s;e till mid|night. There are Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars in the village; the alehou&s;e where they are quartered is not far off, and you had better not &s;tir till the landlord and his gue&s;ts are all gone to &s;leep. If you had only your dre&s;s changed, and the pa&s;sport in your pocket, you are &s;afe."</P>
<P>William renewed his expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude. The prie&s;t took leave of him with his u&s;ual kind|ne&s;s. William ate, drank, and again fell a&s;leep. Towards evening he awoke refre&s;hed and invigora|ted, and in this &s;olitude re&s;igned him&s;elf to his re|flections. With melancholy emotion he reviewed the pa&s;t; hopele&s;s he looked to the future. Whi|ther &s;hould he go? What was to become of him? He knew not, and indeed it was almo&s;t indifferent to him. A man who can work, thought he, may earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence any where; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he mu&s;t fore|go love, it is of no con&s;equence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e he finds a livelihood.</P>
<P>Till now the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence had prevailed in the hou&s;e. William heard not a foot&s;tep, not a word, not a whi&s;per. Two or three mice attracted by the &s;avour of the bacon, and which ran about quite tame, &s;eemed the only inhabitants of the place. In the du&s;k of the evening, however, William thought he heard a feeble moaning in the room be|low. He li&s;tened&mdash;and again all was &s;ilent. I mu&s;t have been mi&s;taken, thought he, and took no farther notice of the circum&s;tance. Scarcely had
<PB N="67" REF="035693_0065_10064CEA2ECFA868">
his mind turned to &s;ome new object, when the moans he had heard again &s;truck his ear. He held in his breath, and again li&s;tened. He now di&s;tinct|ly heard, &s;ometimes with longer, &s;ometimes with &s;horter intervals, &s;ighs and groans. They appeared to i&s;&s;ue from the apartment directly under his place of refuge. The hou&s;e was built entirely of wood, and the thin floor favored his curio&s;ity. He laid him|&s;elf down, and put his ear to the boards. He now heard quite di&s;tinctly that he was not mi&s;taken; but from who&s;e brea&s;t the complaining proceeded&punc; and by what &s;ufferings it was occa&s;ioned, he could not gue&s;s.</P>
<P>Sometimes he thought he heard the voice of the prie&s;t. From this he concluded that there mu&s;t be another wretched &s;ufferer in the hou&s;e be&s;ides him|&s;elf, who was treated by the benevolent prie&s;t with the &s;ame kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality. Still, however, he could not conceive from what the accents of grief and pain which he had heard could ari&s;e. If it was a &s;ick per&s;on, the illne&s;s mu&s;t be &s;evere in|deed which could extort &s;uch violent expre&s;&s;ions of pain and angui&s;h. His heart &s;ympathi&s;ed with the unknown &s;ufferer; and in that feeling he forgot his own danger.</P>
<P>As night advanced the groars became more vio|lent and more ince&s;&s;ant; at la&s;t they changed to &s;hrieks. They were the &s;hrieks of a female, and they cut William &s;o cruelly to the heart that he wi&s;hed him&s;elf with the hu&s;&s;ars in the alehou&s;e. In about half an hour all was &s;ilent; he li&s;tened, and heard &s;ome one &s;tep &s;oftly; in a little time the hou&s;e door creaked on its hinges. Curio&s;ity led him to the window; the moon &s;hone bright. He &s;aw the prie&s;t &s;lip through the court to the garden, and he &s;eemed to carry &s;omething under his ca&s;&s;ock. William's eyes followed him into the garden. The prie&s;t &s;topped under a large tree, laid his burden on the ground, took up a &s;pade, and began to dig.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="035693_0066_10064CEBB9503DC0">The female &s;hrieks had meanwhile changed again into groans and &s;ighs, and William was withdrawn by their gentle influence from the extraordinary &s;cene which he now witne&s;&s;ed. He &s;lipped down &s;tairs upon tiptoe, and, keeping in his breath, ap|proached the apartment from which the voice of angui&s;h proceeded. A glimp&s;e of light di&s;covered to him that the prie&s;t as he went out had left the door a-jar. He advanced, and &s;aw the floor &s;tain|ed with new-&s;hed b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood; a lamp threw a feeble light upon a bed, in which lay a young woman pale as death.&mdash;Here I mu&s;t drop the pen, nor attempt to paint the horror of William's feelings&mdash;Eternal Providence! it was Jeanette!</P>
<P>Cold as a &s;tone, and deprived of &s;en&s;ation, &s;tood the wretched youth. His feet were rooted to the floor, his knees knocked again&s;t each other, his hair &s;tood on end, his eyes gazed motionle&s;s on the &s;pec|tre that threw around a doleful glance, and groaned. He attempted to cry, but his throat was choaked; he attempted to fly, but his limbs were nervele&s;s.&mdash; How long he &s;tood, how at la&s;t he had torn him&s;elf from the frightful &s;cene, how he reached the &s;treet-door and gained the high road, and of every circum|&s;tance which had pa&s;&s;ed, he had next morning no|thing but a confu&s;ed remembrance. When he fir&s;t recovered his &s;en&s;es, he found him&s;elf &s;eated under a tree; the &s;un was high, and a young pea&s;ant girl that &s;tood before him a&s;ked kindly whether he was ill; offering him at the &s;ame time a pitcher of milk for his refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>He gazed at this girl with wild looks. He felt as if he had recovered from the delirium of a fever. "I thank you, my girl," &s;aid he in &s;eeble accents, "I want nothing."&mdash;The girl threw a compa&s;&s;ion|ate glance at him, &s;hook her head, and went away.</P>

<P>WHEN God &s;ent grief into the world he gave in&s;en&s;ibility as its beneficent companion. Grief &s;ometimes would, in a moment, annihilate the machine, if it did not plunge us into the bo&s;om of in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>William flew, uncon&s;cious, from the &s;cene of horror. Ha&s;tily, and without reflection, he contin|ued to walk on. He went pa&s;t the alehou&s;e; by the moon light he &s;aw two hu&s;&s;ars &s;leeping upon a bench, and never mended his pace. After walking &s;everal hours, exhau&s;ted with fatigue, he threw him|&s;elf upon the gra&s;s, under a tree. The chill morn|ing due wet him to the &s;kin&mdash;he felt it not.&mdash;Night &s;ucceeded to day&mdash;he &s;aw it not.&mdash;The lark mount|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">loft to greet the morn with her melodious notes&mdash;but he heard it not. When the milk-maid left him, he gazed after her without thinking what he did; he dropped his head upon the ground, and, as far as he could reach, plucked the dai&s;ies which grew around.</P>
<P>About noon a &s;torm aro&s;e, and the di&s;tant thun|der rolled. William heard it, as through a &s;lum|ber, and it was plea&s;ant to him. The heavens were ob&s;cured with gloomy clouds, and he rai&s;ed his eyes with &s;atisfaction. The big drops of rain fell upon his face; they cooled the heat of his glow|ing cheeks. The lightning fla&s;hed more and more vivid; the thunder p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aled louder and louder, and William began to breathe more freely. A violent
<PB N="70" REF="035693_0068_10064CF05EC68658">
&s;hower of hail, accompanied by a furious whirl|wind, ru&s;hed from the black bo&s;om of an angry cloud. A little penthou&s;e offered a &s;afe &s;helter to the traveller. William &s;aw it, but he moved not from his place.</P>
<P>At this moment, a party of hu&s;&s;ars pa&s;&s;ed by. To &s;hield them&s;elves from the &s;torm, they had drawn their cloaks over their faces, and rode on at a rapid pace. They &s;aw him not; but William viewed them without apprehen&s;ion; he recogni&s;ed them to be Pru&s;&s;ians, and could not comprehend for what rea&s;on they appeared in &s;uch numbers in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The louder the &s;torm howled and the thunder roared, the more he felt his brea&s;t lightened; with more firmne&s;s he looked up. The tempe&s;t now hung over his head. Not an hundred paces from the place where he lay, the lightning, with tremen|dous cra&s;h, &s;truck an oak-tree, and &s;hivered it to pieces from the top to the very root.</P>
<P>"Why not <HI>this!</HI>" &s;aid William, pointing to the tree under which he lay. "O God! annihilate me amid&s;t this conflict of the elements! Take back thy unwelcome pre&s;ent of exi&s;tence, and give it to the fool who thinks it worth his pains to thank thee for it!"</P>
<P>Happy for thee, wretched youth, that thy lips, which angui&s;h had &s;ealed, are again opened.

ri&s;ing thought of &s;elf murder. "I am not yet wholly detached from the chain of exi&s;tence," exclaimed he, "I have &s;till a friend whom I mu&s;t &s;ave! a friend to whom I have pledged my&s;elf to defend my life.&mdash;Fly! fly! every &s;tep increa&s;es his tran|quility, and removes you from the faithle&s;s woman on whom you doted!&mdash;Ah! Jeanette! Jeanette! how low art thou fallen!</P>
<P>He now ro&s;e, and proceeded on his journey. Towards evening, he arrived in the town to which the prie&s;t had directed him. Here he recollected the letter he had received to the mayor; and though his heart revolted at the idea of obtaining a favour by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a man who had violated the &s;anctuary of his heart, yet the con&s;ideration that the &s;afety of his friend was now his only duty, prevailed, and reluctantly compelled him to take this &s;tep. He went to the mayor's hou&s;e, was u&s;hered in to an old &s;ilver-haired per&s;onage with a benevo|lent countenance, to whom he pre&s;ented the letter.</P>
<P>The old man took the letter, peru&s;ed it with amazement, threw an inqui&s;itive look at William, and the &s;ymptoms of di&s;&s;atisfaction were vi&s;ible in his face. He took off his &s;pectacles thoughtfully, laid the letter on the table, and paced &s;ilently through the room. At la&s;t he pulled a bell, his trembling hand &s;eemed reluctantly to perform the &s;ervice. An officer of ju&s;tice immediately appear|ed.</P>
<P>"My friend," &s;aid the old man to William, "I am &s;orry to inform you that you have been betray|ed. You have fallen into a prie&s;t's hands, and of cour&s;e into bad hands. Were you merely a de&s;er|ter, I would willingly overlook the circum&s;tance; but this letter charges you as a murderer. You are my pri&s;oner. Officer do your duty."</P>
<P>William &s;tood petrified. "Is it po&s;&s;ible," exclaimed he, "that &s;o much villany &s;hould lurk
<PB N="72" REF="035693_0070_10064CF4CBFD2B08">
under the ma&s;k of friendly tenderne&s;s? This de|ceitful prie&s;t, who has &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly abu&s;ed the con|fidence of a per&s;ecuted man, has &s;educed an inno|cent girl, murdered his own child, and buried it, la&s;t night, under a tree in his garden."</P>
<P>The hone&s;t old man heard this charge with &s;atis|faction&punc; which William, who&s;e natural feelings of re&s;entment were rou&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch, cir|cum&s;tantially related, without con&s;idering the dan|ger to which he thus expo&s;ed the wretched Jea|nette. With feelings mo&s;t cruelly di&s;tracted, his reliance upon love, faith, and the whole human race &s;everaly &s;haken, he followed the officers of ju&s;tice to pri&s;on, where an heavy chain upon each leg fa&s;tened him to the wall. In other re&s;|pects he was treated with as much indulgence as the &s;trict duty of his judge would permit.</P>
<P>The following night the magi&s;trate repaired, with a party of officers to the hou&s;e of the prie&s;t. The mother did not deny her &s;ituation. When a&s;ked what had become of her child, &s;he replied, that it had been taken from her, and given to a country woman to nur&s;e, though &s;he would willingly have &s;uckled it her&s;elf. She &s;poke this with the tone of innocence and truth; but terror and anxiety &s;at on the prie&s;t's countenance, and betrayed his guilt.</P>
<P>They went out to the garden, and found under a tree the earth n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w turned up. They dug, and found the body of a new born child, wrapped in a bloody cloth, with a large nail driven through its temples. The officers &s;eized the culprit, and threw him in irons into a dungeon, from which the &s;pirit|ual power &s;oon after removed him. He did not, as he de&s;erved, expiate his crime upon the &s;caffold, for the honor of the church was concerned in hu&s;h|ing up the affair. He was &s;hut up in a di&s;tant cloi&s;ter, and nothing more was heard of him.</P>
<P>When poor Jeanette was informed of the murder
<PB N="73" REF="035693_0071_10064CF659F04240">
of her child, &s;he lay three days &s;en&s;ele&s;s; on the fourth &s;he was delirious. The humane ju&s;tice did not attempt, in this &s;ituation, to throw her into clo&s;e confinement. He ordered a phy&s;ician to be called, and appointed nur&s;es and midwives to attend her; and after the lap&s;e of a month, when the phy&s;ician declared that &s;he could be removed without dan|ger, &s;he was carried to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>During this period, William langui&s;hed in his cell, without knowing what was determined re&s;pect|ing his fate. Legal forms had retarded his being delivered up. It was nece&s;&s;ary to write to the gar|ri&s;on, and receive an&s;wers backwards and forwards, till at la&s;t the news arrived that a party of &s;oldiers were &s;ent to take him into cu&s;tody. The ju&s;tice was anxious to accelerate William's removal; be|cau&s;e the place where he was confined was the only apartment in the pri&s;on in which a man could be lodged without danger to his health.</P>
<P>One morning when the youth was bu&s;y in trying to entice, with crumbs of bread, a mou&s;e, which was his only companion, to come nearer, he heard, at an unu&s;ual hour, the doors of his pri&s;on grate har&s;h|ly on their hinges, and the heavy keys rattle. The officers of ju&s;tice opened the door, and pu&s;hed in a woman, who &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the thre&s;hold.&mdash; "Jeanette!" e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">claimed William, and tore his chains, and tugged with all his might at the rings which fa&s;tened him to the wall.

He roared out with agony!&mdash;The noi&s;e he made, and the clanking of his chains, awoke the wretched girl from her &s;woon.

He was indeed &s;o once, but di&s;hone&s;t people had cheated him out of his property. He was anxious to have an opulent &s;on-in-law to re-e&s;tabli&s;h his affairs.

<P>"At la&s;t, he addre&s;&s;ed the old lady with a pro|po&s;al to take me as his hou&s;e-keeper. He him&s;elf indeed remarked, that I was too young; but he re|lied upon my di&s;cretion, and upon his own well-e&s;tabli&s;hed character. This propo&s;al was extreme|ly acceptable to my avaricious aunt. She never cea&s;ed to congratulate me on my good fortune; &s;he extolled his piety and the fame of his holine&s;s throughout the country. She di&s;played, with all her eloquence, the advantages of &s;uch a &s;ituation in the cleare&s;t light. She repre&s;ented to me, that I &s;hould be &s;upplied with every thing, that my repu|tation would be &s;hielded from all attack.

<P>"For many months, indeed, I had no rea&s;on to repent the &s;tep I had taken. Father Hieronymus treated me with &s;tudied attention; whenever it was in his power he anticipated my wi&s;hes, and

&s;eemed as dependent upon me as I was upon him. At this period indeed tranquility, that friend by whom I had been &s;o long de&s;erted, again returned to my brea&s;t. I called him father; he called me daughter. Gratitude filled up the void in my heart.</P>
<P>"Sometimes, indeed, it &s;truck me that his eyes dwelt upon me with unu&s;al fire. I called it kind|ne&s;s; it was voluptuou&s;ne&s;s.

When he found that he did not &s;ucceed in this attempt, he endea|voured by a thou&s;and arts to inflame my pa&s;&s;ions. When here too he was baffled, he employed the mo&s;t villainous arts, mingled heating drugs in my food, and &s;tupefying potions in my drink, till in an evil hour he availed him&s;elf of a death-like in|&s;en&s;ibility to render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a violated form, and reduced me to a wretched, degraded woman!&mdash; Alas!

Alas! I knew not the villainy of my &s;e|ducer, and my own feeble means of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>"I am puni&s;hed!&mdash;The cup of my &s;ufferings is filled to the very brim, and I mu&s;t drink it to the dregs.&mdash;I defy the utmo&s;t malice of fate, and I fly to a pri&s;on with joy, there to conceal my &s;hame.&mdash; At lea&s;t, the&s;e were the &s;entiments I felt an hour ago.

<P>She threw her&s;elf at his feet, and bathed his knees with her tears. Her moi&s;tened hair clung round his chains; her trembling arms embraced the pillar to which he was fa&s;tened. William's heart was brui&s;ed to pieces, and his tears mingled with hers.</P>
<P>"Till death &s;hall I love thee!" exclaimed William &s;uffocated with &s;obs; "till death &s;hall I love thee, poor ill-fated girl! I&mdash;I alone am to blame for thy undoing!&mdash;My precipitate elopement gave this cruel turn to thy fortune.

<P>Thus did this luckle&s;s pair mingle their com|plaints, and mutually exculpate each other, till in about an hour the doors of the pri&s;on were again opened, and a party of &s;oldiers entered, to whom the gaoler delivered up William.

the blame upon the decea&s;ed, who cannot contra|dict you.</P>
</SP>
<P>With the&s;e words the good-hearted captain left the guiltle&s;s pri&s;oner. William was put into clo&s;e confinement, again chained to the wall, and fed upon bread and water. There was a little grated window, through which you might &s;ee into the cell. Almo&s;t all his comrades came to the grate to &s;ee him, and to &s;ympathize with his &s;ituation&mdash; Almo&s;t all&mdash;except Frederick Perl&s;tadt.</P>
<P>"He is right," thought William. "His heart is made of too &s;u&s;ceptible &s;tuff; he would betray him&s;elf."&mdash;In tranquil expectation he awaited the coming day, in order to confirm the &s;uppo&s;ition of his guilt by a &s;olemn confe&s;&s;ion upon his trial.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the &s;cene was &s;uddenly changed. Two hours after William's arrival, Frederick Perl|&s;tadt came pale as death, but firm and collected, to the guard-room, took off his &s;word, gave it to the corporal, and de&s;ired to be taken into cu&s;tody, as he was really Frank Moritz's murderer. They &s;tared at him and thought him out of his wits; but he per&s;evered in his purpo&s;e. The commanding officer of the watch was called. Frederick repeat|ed his &s;tory. He was therefore taken into cu&s;tody, and the affair reported to the commanding officer.</P>
<P>Next morning a court-martial was a&s;&s;embled, which was not a little confounded, at the behaviour of both the pri&s;oners, as each of them re&s;olutely per&s;i&s;ted in &s;aying that he was the criminal. They were confronted, &s;unk into each other's arms, and kindly reproached one another with their mutual ob&s;tinacy. The circum&s;tance was &s;o &s;ingular that it excited great attention. The duke of Brun&s;wick, the commander in chief of the Pru&s;&s;ian troops, happened to be then in the garri&s;on. His curio&s;ity was rai&s;ed, and he ordered the pri&s;oners to be brought before him. Frederick, without he&s;itation, relate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="82" REF="035693_0080_10064D0CDCA93438">
the affair as it had really happened, and how his friend had &s;acrificed him&s;elf on his account to &s;pare the &s;ufferings of an old drooping father. He had accepted the magnanimous offer of his friend, in hopes that he would make his e&s;cape, and becau&s;e by his talents he would be able to provide for him&s;elf every where. Now, however, as the in|nocent young man had been apprehended, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to derive any advantage from his generous devotion. He knew that he mu&s;t die, but death would be le&s;s bitter to him than the thought of having brought his friend to the gal|lows.</P>
<P>William contradicted this &s;tory in every point, told how Frederick from his youth had been the victim of a cruel &s;tep-mother, and at la&s;t had been driven by her artifices to enli&s;t. He had embra|ced the life of a &s;oldier with reluctance; &s;ince ever he had known him he had been overwhelmed with di&s;gu&s;t at exi&s;tence, and he had often expre&s;|&s;ed how eagerly he wi&s;hed for &s;ome favourable opportunity of &s;acrificing his life for a man of worth and honor. He entreated the duke not to a&s;k him to profit by this mental malady of his friend. He only in an unlucky hour had done the act, and was willing to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment which it involved.</P>
<P>The excellent duke eyed them alternately. "You are a couple of brave lads," &s;aid he with emotion; "one or other of you mu&s;t have done it. Con|fe&s;s to me candidly: I will report the affair to the king, and who knows what may happen?"</P>
<P>His arguments, however, were in vain. The two friends per&s;i&s;ted in their &s;tory, and Heaven knows how the affair would have terminated if the <HI>vi&s;um repertum</HI> had not contributed to unravel the my&s;tery. The body of Moritz had been examined with the u&s;ual formalities, and a detailed account
<PB N="83" REF="035693_0081_10064D0E68E6EAB0">
of it drawn up. From the&s;e minutes it appeared that the wound had been inflicted with a &s;word, which, a few inches from the point, had a pretty deep notch. The auditor availed him&s;elf of this hint, cau&s;ed the &s;words of the two delinquents to be examined, and it was di&s;covered that Frederick's &s;word had this identical notch. William's denial was now in vain; the affair was decided. Frederick re&s;igned him&s;elf to joy, and William to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>But the generous conte&s;t between the two young men had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of the duke. He reported this extraordinary oc|currence to the court, and employed his intere&s;t to procure a pardon for the parties. William ac|cordingly was liberated without puni&s;hment, and Frederick condemned to a year's labour on the ramparts.</P>
<P>William now applied him&s;elf to the &s;ervice as before; and when he could &s;pare an hour, he flew to the ramparts to vi&s;it his friend, and to carry him refre&s;hments and con&s;olation; or, when duty per|mitted he would labour for half a day in&s;tead of his companion. By this generous proceeding, by his attention to his duty, his &s;obriety and fidelity, he gained the friend&s;hip of his &s;uperiors in &s;o high a degree, that in a year's time he was promoted to be a &s;ergeant. The period of Frederick's &s;entence was now expired, and the two friends were more in&s;eparable than ever. Officers and privates con|&s;idered them with &s;ome degree of re&s;pect, and William was rendered particularly intere&s;ting by a &s;ettled melancholy which hung upon his counte|nance. Alas! how could his heart enjoy tranquil|lity when he thought of Jeanette's fate!</P>
<P>He had received intelligence, that although pro|nounced innocen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the charge of child-murder, &s;he had been condemned to &s;ix years impri&s;on|ment in the correction-hou&s;e for having concealed

The image of this &s;ufferer, &s;till &s;o dear to him, haunted his imagination ince&s;|&s;antly. He could not drink a drop of wine while he knew that Jeanette was langui&s;hing upon bread and water. He could not be gay while &s;he pined in tears.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XV. FORTUNE OF WAR.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM's regiment received &s;udden orders to march. The victorious enemy revenged the di&s;grace with which their capital had ra&s;hly been threatened. They ru&s;hed over the boundaries of the German empire, and every effort was re|quired to check their impetuous career.</P>
<P>William and Frederick fought with di&s;tingui&s;hed courage; for the one fought death, and the other an opportunity to &s;ave the life of his friend. Cour|age is a quality which combines with every other pa&s;&s;ion; it equally a&s;&s;ociates it&s;elf with love and honour, with hatred and revenge. Towards the end of the campaign, one day the grenadier com|pany of the regiment of O&s;tein received orders to &s;torm an enemy's redoubt immediately under the eye of the commander in chief. They advanced under a &s;hower of grape &s;hot. The captain lo&s;t an arm, the fir&s;t lieutenant a leg, and the &s;econd was left dead on the &s;pot. The en&s;ign, a delicate

milk&s;op, took to flight. The brave grenadiers depri|ved of their leaders, expo&s;ed to an horrible di&s;charge of artillery, began to give way, and but a moment longer and they would have fled. William then &s;prang forward, and exclaimed with animation: "Follow me, my friends! for the king and for our country!"</P>
<P>With fixed bayonet he a&s;cended the hill; his companions pre&s;&s;ed round him with wild cries; Frederick was at his &s;ide. A &s;hot carried off his grenadier's cap and half of his ear. Bleeding vio|lently, his head bare, William reached the top of the eminence, and ran through the body the engi|neer as he was on the point of applying the match to the touch-hole. The conflict was now decided by the bayonet. William received a thru&s;t through his &s;ide. Frederick &s;tretched upon the ground the man who did it. William &s;unk down, and &s;houted "Victory!" Frederick thought his friend was killed, and raged like a lion among the enemy. A private &s;oldier here decided the event of the enter|pri&s;e. Reader! you are &s;urpri&s;ed?&mdash;The gazette, it is true, &s;ays nothing of the matter. Often, how|ever, has the courage of a common grenadier, who&s;e exertions are afterwards rewarded with a crown, atchieved exploits which in future periods, &s;hine in the biography of the general.</P>
<P>The redoubt was taken; the enemy fled; Wil|liam was carried to the ho&s;pital. His wounds were no farther dangerous than from the lo&s;s of blood they had occa&s;ioned, and in three weeks he was perfectly recovered. He received a me&s;&s;age to at|tend at head-quarters.</P>
<P>"En&s;ign Meadows," &s;aid the general, pre&s;enting him with a &s;word, "it gives me plea&s;ure to reward your gallantry. The king allows you an hundred ducats to provide your accoutrements."</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="035693_0084_10064D14B0324D78">The mode&s;t young man was almo&s;t a&s;hamed of a di&s;tinction for which he was con&s;cious that he was indebted to the courage of de&s;pair. He even ven|tured to repre&s;ent to the general, that, if the di&s;|charge of duty con&s;tituted any claim to reward, Frederick Perl&s;tadt's preten&s;ions were perhaps better founded than his.</P>
<P>"I have not overlooked his merits," replied the general. "Perl&s;tadt &s;ucceeds you."</P>
<P>Ha! What &s;neers were thrown out by the little-minded noblemen when they &s;aw William the port|er's &s;on appear with &s;carf and epaulets, and invited to the general's table! "To rai&s;e him to the rank of en&s;ign might pa&s;s, as it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a thing might be de&s;erved; but to bring him to the table of a prince, among men of birth and rank, that was too much."</P>
<P>The &s;neers and the whi&s;pers were &s;till more loud when William, who had ju&s;t enjoyed the honor of dining with the commander in chief, met his friend Perl&s;tadt at the door of his tent, and embraced him without ceremony. One of his new comrades, a hero over a gla&s;s and a lamb in the field of battle, tripped up to him with great &s;elf-importance, and, pulling him by the &s;leeve, whi&s;pered: "En&s;ign, that really is improper."</P>

<P>William &s;miled&mdash;"I have often heard," would he &s;ay, "that family pride is intolerable, but I find the contrary to be the ca&s;e; for it rids us of trou|ble&s;ome company."</P>
<P>Mode&s;t and unaffected, firmly attached to e&s;tab|li&s;hed principles, indulgent to fools, and haughty to the in&s;olent, William &s;howed that he knew how to maintain by the dignity of merit what he had gain|ed in the field of battle by the equivocal courage of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The troops retired into winter quarters. William divided his days between the performance of his du|ty, the calls of friend&s;hip, and the cultivation of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d. His nights were &s;pent in broken &s;lumbers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in tears for Jeanette.

<P>He checked the wi&s;h he felt to &s;ee her, and con|tented him&s;elf with &s;ending her every month, by the hands of a worthy merchant who had exten&s;ive de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lings at Mun&s;ter, the money which he was able to &s;ave out of his pay.

<P>Jeanette received this gratuity with a&s;toni&s;hment. "Lives there yet a human being in the world who pities me? I know nobody but William, and him I have cruelly injured! His magnanimity, indeed, forgav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me; but is he &s;till alive? Has he not taken upon him&s;elf another's guilt?

He never &s;aid a &s;yllable more, and neither tears nor entreaties could extort a word from him. Jeanette thought him cruel, but he knew nothing of the matter him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What rapture did William feel, when fir&s;t he &s;aw Jeanette's &s;ub&s;cription! what &s;orrow when he read: "The unfortunate Jeanette Jerome returns her thanks to her unknown benefactor, and earne&s;t|ly wi&s;hes to know his name.

<P><PB N="89" REF="035693_0087_10064D1ADC8963B0">The campaign was opened with great fury; &s;kir|mi&s;hes and battles were daily occurrences. Di&s;cord &s;at on a &s;able cloud, looked down with a gha&s;tly &s;mile, and with bloody lips ki&s;&s;ed her general, <HI>Death,</HI> who with unwearied efforts overthrew the hopes of wives and mothers. William and Frederick, as in the former campaign, behaved with great gallantry. Courage without fortune, however, is like merit without birth; neither of them can obtain di&s;tinc|tion. The two young heroes wanted an opportu|nity to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves; and to confe&s;s the truth, William did not covet &s;uch an opportunity &s;o eagerly as formerly. What had he to lo&s;e the preceding year? At that time death to him would have been a joyful event. Now, however&mdash;who would &s;hare the &s;canty pittance with Jeanette, &s;hould William fall?&mdash;Whoever wi&s;hes to rai&s;e an army of de&s;perate heroes, let him admit no lover among them who contributes to the &s;upport of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But &s;top! Once indeed chance pre&s;ented the young hero with an opportunity of &s;ignalizing him|&s;elf, and he &s;eized it with avidity. Under the view of the king a deci&s;ive action was to be fought. Each party endeavored to gain a march upon the other, in order to be able to occupy the mo&s;t advantageous po&s;i|tion upon the plain where the action was to take place. It was the intention of the general to extend the left wing to a village, which it was nece&s;&s;ary to occupy before the arrival of the enemy. A &s;trong corps was detached to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this village. The enemy, who had gained a march of &s;ome miles, were approaching very near. They had already advanc|ed into the village in great numbers, compelled the corps to give way, and were on the point of di&s;con|certing the king's plan of operation.</P>
<P>William &s;aw how extremely important it was to gain time. He found him&s;elf in the middle of the
<PB N="90" REF="035693_0088_10064D1D9BDBF928">
di&s;ordered crowd, and was hurried along with the fugitives. By threats and remon&s;trances he at la&s;t collected a little troop, and, with a few hundred grenadiers and &s;ome rifle-men, threw him&s;elf into the church, which was &s;ituated in &s;uch a manner as to command the whole of the plain. Here he barricaded the doors with the benches and &s;eats, and po&s;ted his men advantageou&s;ly at the windows. Grenadoes were &s;cattered among the foe wherever they appeared in numbers, and the rifle-men levell|ed every one who ventured to come too near.</P>
<P>The enemy, who&s;e numbers every moment in|crea&s;ed, were ungovernable with rage, to find them|&s;elves checked by a handful of men. In vain they poured &s;howers of balls in at the windows. The gallant fellows were &s;heltered by the walls. A ge|neral advanced, and, convinced of the importance of the po&s;t, conde&s;cended, at the head of an army, to offer the little party a free retreat. William an|&s;wered: He was determined rather to bury him&s;elf under the ruins of the church.</P>
<P>Already more dead lay on the graves in the church-yard than under the ground; but William's companions had nearly expended all their ammu|nition, and the enemy were preparing to open their heavy artillery upon the church, when the king, who had availed him&s;elf of this diver&s;ion, &s;uddenly appeared with the whole army. As long as Wil|liam held out, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the enemy to form their right wing as they wi&s;hed. They were, therefore obliged to abandon this po&s;ition entirely, and the fortunate i&s;&s;ue of the battle was partly a&s;cribed to the gallant officer who had &s;o bravely defend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the church.</P>
<P>"Who is he? What is his name?" &s;aid the king.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="035693_0089_10064D20A2F8F508">William was pre&s;ented to him. With glowing cheeks and downea&s;t eyes, he &s;tood as if a&s;hamed of the &s;ervice he had performed.</P>
<P>"I return you my thanks, lieutenant," &s;aid the king, "You have this day done us mo&s;t noble &s;er|vice. Speak, what can I do for you?"</P>
<P>"Plea&s;e your maje&s;ty!" exclaimed William, throwing him&s;elf at his &s;overeign's feet, "I have an unfortunate &s;i&s;ter&mdash;&s;he does not carry my name in|deed&mdash;&s;he is but my half &s;i&s;ter&mdash;yet I love her more than if we had lai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> under the &s;ame heart.&mdash;Youth and ba&s;e &s;eduction have plunged her into mi&s;ery! Three years has &s;he langui&s;hed in pri&s;on, and three years more is the ill-fated girl condemned to expi|ate the crime of a villain. I intreat your maje&s;ty for her liberty!"</P>
<P>The king inquired the particulars of the affair; and when he heard that Jeanette was entirely inno|cent of the child-murder, he granted William's prayer, gave him a letter of recommendation writ|ten with his own hand, and leave of ab&s;ence for ten days, that he might in per&s;on announce to his beloved &s;i&s;ter her freedom.</P>
<P>William could not expre&s;s his thanks, he could only weep. It is a charming thing to &s;ee a man &s;hed tears, who two hours before has performed an heroic action. The king was affected. "I will provide farther for you," &s;aid he. William flow out of the tent. Frederick in vain a&s;ked him what was the matter. He could utter only a few broken &s;yllables, embraced his friend with tears, ordered his hor&s;e to be &s;addled, and &s;et off full &s;peed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. THE MEETING AND SEPARATION.</HEAD>
<P>MUNSTER is a city of con&s;iderable celebrity. The traveller, if he is a politician, vi&s;its with re&s;pect the town-hall, in which the famous treaty of We&s;tphalia was concluded, of which the differ|ent contracting parties ob&s;erved ju&s;t no more than they &s;ound convenient. If he is a curious traveller, he &s;eats him&s;elf with fear and awe in the chair of king John of Leyden, who twice baptized his fol|lowers, though once &s;eems quite &s;ufficient. The &s;entimental traveller, however, will in future vi&s;it the little cell where for three long years Jeanette &s;uffered for the ab&s;urdities of the primitive church, and the arts of prie&s;tcraft which it had produced.</P>
<P>The &s;hades of evening had already begun to de|&s;cend upon St. Paul's hill, in the neighbourhood of the town, and the harve&s;t mi&s;ts began to veil the tops of an hundred u&s;ele&s;s &s;teeples, when William allowed his blowing &s;teed to &s;top at the barriers, and with ha&s;ty impatience an&s;wered the que&s;tions of the officer on guard. He di&s;mounted at the fir&s;t good inn he came to, gave his hor&s;e to the fir&s;t per|&s;on he met, called a porter from the &s;treet to guide him, and, covered with du&s;t and &s;weat, was u&s;her|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d into the antichamber of the magi&s;trate to whom his letters were addre&s;&s;ed. Some time elap&s;ed be|fore he obtained an audience; for the magi&s;trate, in company with his confe&s;&s;or and an old gouty coun&s;ellor, had five points to play out at an intere&s;t|ing game of ombre. William bit his nails, and viewed, without the lea&s;t intere&s;t, the pictures of the &s;aints which adorned the antichamber.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="035693_0091_10064D23E7181268">At la&s;t the doors were opened, and he delivered his di&s;patches. The king's &s;uper&s;cription produ|ced a powerful effect; the affair was immediately de|cided; but the execution of it was po&s;tponed till the next day, and the lieutenant invited to &s;up. Although for three days William had &s;carcely eaten a mor|&s;el, he felt not the &s;lighte&s;t &s;en&s;ation of hunger. He could not conceive how the magi&s;trate had in|vited him &s;o calmly, how the &s;ervants &s;o uncon|cernedly waited at table, and every thing procee|ded &s;o evenly in its natural cour&s;e.</P>
<P>"Speedy a&s;&s;i&s;tance," &s;aid William, "doubles its value. Night appears long to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck, but to the wretched it &s;eems longer &s;till.

<P>His whole appearance prayed mo&s;t affectingly to be excu&s;ed, as he &s;aid the&s;e words, but there was no remedy. Your great people think they can confer no higher honour upon a common untitled man than to permit him to eat in their company; and as they them&s;elves place &s;o high a value upon the favour, they are not plea&s;ed that others &s;hould treat it with indifference. They do not con&s;ider, that a man of &s;en&s;e and independence pays dearer for his dinner by con&s;traint and ceremony, than if he went to dine at the mo&s;t expen&s;ive tavern.</P>
<P>Poor William &s;at upon thorns&punc; and whenever he &s;aw a new di&s;h placed upon the table, he was ready to expire with vexation. During &s;upper, his excellency read a lecture upon politics, in which he declared that he had long ago predicted, in the cabinet, every thing which had lately happened,
<PB N="94" REF="035693_0092_10064D288AA5DC50">
and every now and then appealed to the coun&s;el|lor for the truth of his &s;tory; and the latter corro|borated every word with "Yes, brother," and at la&s;t became as eloquent in his turn, when the con|ver&s;ation related to the different flavours of <HI>Rheni&s;h.</HI> On this &s;ubject the confe&s;&s;or found him&s;elf at home. He &s;wallowed every gla&s;s with the air of a con|noi&s;&s;eur, &s;macked his lips, and began to rail again&s;t a party of Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars, who, when he was &s;u|perintendant of a certain convent, had drank a whole ca&s;k of the be&s;t old hock.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the hour of breaking up arrived, and William received his di&s;charge. With what ra|pidity did he de&s;cend the &s;tair-ca&s;e! a little fat &s;e|cretary was &s;carcely able to follow him. In the &s;treet he would have left his companion behind, if he could have found his way to the correction|hou&s;e without him.

<P>"We mu&s;t ring," &s;aid the &s;ecretary; and in an in&s;tant William had broke down the bell. Jea|nette was paying her evening devotions. William was the &s;aint to whom &s;he commended her&s;elf;

<P>There are &s;cenes in human life which after the curtain drops appear a dream to tho&s;e who have played the principal parts. Such &s;cenes defy all the &s;kill of art to repre&s;ent; and if the arti&s;t does not find the picture already &s;ketched in the imagi|nation of the reader, it is better to throw away the pencil.</P>
<P>Jeanette was uncon&s;cious of what pa&s;&s;ed around her. In&s;en&s;ible &s;he lay in William's arms, in&s;en|&s;ible was &s;he carried to an hackney coach; and when &s;he at la&s;t recovered from her &s;woon, in a &s;trange room, &s;he began to con&s;ider, with a&s;toni&s;hment, how &s;he had come into this hou&s;e, and lay in this bed.</P>
<P>All was &s;till around. Near the bed &s;tood a night lamp, which &s;hed a melancholy light on the old em|broidered tape&s;try. "Where am I?" &s;aid &s;he. "Did not William appear to me? Alas! I have had &s;trange dreams."</P>
<P>She now accidentally looked round, and &s;aw her beloved &s;itting at the bed-&s;ide; the exce&s;&s;ive fatigue of the three preceding days and nights had thrown him, in &s;pite of his efforts, into a &s;hort &s;lum|ber. "William!" &s;houted Jeanette. He awoke, and &s;unk down on her bo&s;om. A flood of joyful tears ea&s;ed his panting bo&s;om. After many &s;ilent embraces, William at la&s;t recovered &s;trength and recollection to relate his &s;tory in broken &s;entences.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="035693_0094_10064D2D0D1384D8">Jeanette li&s;tened with great attention, and par|ticularly inquired the period when he was rai&s;ed to be an officer. His an&s;wer coincided with her &s;u&s;|picions. The my&s;tery of the unknown benefactor was now &s;olved.&mdash;"Yes, it is you to whom I am indebted for every thing! My heart long &s;ince whi&s;pered it to me!"&mdash;She hung, &s;obbing, round his neck. Day found them di&s;&s;olved in delightful tears; night &s;urpri&s;ed them in innocent endearments. Quicker than thought two days flew away.</P>
<P>What might not a young man, who had gained &s;o many titles to the love and gratitude of his mi&s;tre&s;s, have a&s;ked? What might he not have ventured to attempt? But William honoured in|nocence and virtue, which, though once left de|fencele&s;s in the &s;poiler's cruel fangs, had never for&s;aken the fair man&s;ion in which they re&s;ided. At the word <HI>innocence,</HI> perhaps &s;ome prudes may &s;neer. It is an eternal truth, however, that inno|cence is gone only when the purity of the heart is lo&s;t, and many women, who may boa&s;t them&s;elves innocent from man, have forfeited theirs.</P>
<P>When they began to enjoy &s;ome moments of tranquility, the que&s;tion naturally aro&s;e, "What is to be done with Jeanette?"</P>
<P>"She &s;hall be my wife!" exclaimed, William, and pre&s;&s;ed her, blu&s;hing, to his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>"God forbid," &s;aid the generous girl, "that one who has &s;uffered an ignominious puni&s;hment &s;hould &s;tain thy opening fame! How could you &s;ubmit to the &s;arca&s;tic je&s;ts of your comrades?"</P>
<P>"Ha! I would&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Why, yes, I know what you would do. You would dye your &s;word in blood to wipe away my &s;hame; you would make me a widow, or your&s;elf a murderer.&mdash;No, William, the king cannot tru&s;t the honor of a man who could give his hand to a degraded outca&s;t like me. Though I may be more

unfortunate than capable, though I de&s;erve pity rather than contempt, this I mu&s;t demon&s;trate by the refu&s;al of a hand, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which I &s;o willingly would have purcha&s;ed with my blood. You have called me &s;i&s;ter&mdash;Then, brother William, let us for ever forego the &s;weete&s;t and the mo&s;t endearing of appellations!"</P>
<P>William exerted all the eloquence of love to &s;hake this re&s;olution. Five days of his period of ab&s;ence were now elap&s;ed, the &s;ixth arrived, and he had no time to lo&s;e. The heart of the poor girl was a&s;&s;ailed with care&s;&s;es and with &s;pecious argu|ments, which in &s;uch ca&s;es commonly pa&s;s for in|vincible rea&s;ons. She felt that longer re&s;i&s;tance exceeded her power, and that &s;he mu&s;t at length yield to the &s;olicitations of her lover. With great difficulty &s;he obtained a &s;hort re&s;pite from him till next day.</P>
<P>When he tenderly pre&s;&s;ed her hand, as he retired to bed, and had opened the door to go to his apart|ment, &s;he threw her&s;elf abruptly round his neck, and wept bitterly. "What ails you, Jeanette?" &mdash;"Nothing! nothing!&mdash;To-morrow! to-morrow!" "How? Do you think with alarm of the happy hour which will extort from you the delightful promi&s;e to be eternally mine?"&mdash;"No! no!&mdash; Eternally thine!&mdash;Go, good William&mdash;&s;leep &s;ound &mdash;for God's &s;ake go!&mdash;I can endure it no longer!"</P>
<P>William withdrew. Delightful hopes &s;oon lull|ed him to &s;leep, and plea&s;ant dreams hovered over his head. Ha&s;tily he &s;prung out of bed next morn|ing, threw on his great coat, and &s;lipped &s;oftly to the door of Jeanette's room. He found that it was only on the latch, opened it without noi&s;e, and whi&s;pered, "Are you awake, dear Jeanette?"&mdash; There was no an&s;wer.&mdash;He put his head into the room, it was empty&mdash;he threw a glance towards

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. THE WANDERER.</HEAD>
<P>JEANETTE, with a &s;mall bundle hanging on her arm, and a few pieces of gold in her pocket, had &s;ilently &s;tolen at midnight out of the inn. She fir&s;t thought of applying to her old aunt; but after what had happened how could &s;he expect a wel|come reception? Had &s;he, during three years, ever &s;hown the lea&s;t anxiety about the poor orphan, or ever &s;ent the lea&s;t refre&s;hment to her cell? Jeanette preferred throwing her&s;elf on the wide world.</P>
<P>With great difficulty, and by doubling the toll at the gate, &s;he prevailed upon the centinel to let her pa&s;s, under pretence of going to vi&s;it a &s;ick per&s;on
<PB N="101" REF="035693_0099_1006487D33BCFEC0">
in the &s;uburbs. When morning dawned, &s;he had already walked a mile, and arrived at a village where two roads cro&s;&s;ed each other. She &s;at down to re&s;t her&s;elf under a row of trees at the entrance of the village, where &s;he had not been long when a &s;tage|coach pa&s;&s;ed by. A few hundred &s;teps farther on, the carriage &s;topped at an alehou&s;e, becau&s;e the po&s;tillion, according to the laudable cu&s;tom of his calling, wi&s;hed to have his morning pint.</P>
<P>The idea in&s;tantly &s;truck Jeanette, "What if I &s;hould take a place in this coach, and go on with it, in order the &s;ooner to e&s;cape from William's inqui|ries?"</P>
<P>She yet was entirely ignorant whither the road on which &s;he now travelled conducted. This, however, was of little con&s;equence, as &s;he had the world before her, and had left Mun&s;ter behind. In the fir&s;t con&s;iderable town, whatever it was, &s;he re|&s;olved to apply for &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Engro&s;&s;ed with the&s;e reflections &s;he went into the alehou&s;e, and found the po&s;tillion at breakfa&s;t. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> propo&s;ed to take a place in his vehicle, and at the &s;ame time offered him &s;ome drink-money. He grinned at the &s;ight of her white teeth, expre&s;&s;ed his con&s;ent by a nod, and &s;ea&s;oned his complai&s;ance with &s;ome dry jokes at the expence of the &s;olitary pede&s;trian. After he had fini&s;hed his breakfa&s;t, and with ru&s;tic politene&s;s invited Jeanette to drink a gla&s;s, he went out to the coach: "Gentlemen, &s;it a little clo&s;er if you plea&s;e, and make room for a pretty young girl, who has walked her&s;elf lame." With blunt officiou&s;ne&s;s he a&s;&s;i&s;ted Jeanette into her place; and, as the weather was fine, he took his great coat down from the coach-box, and &s;pread it under the &s;eat as a bol&s;ter. The power of beauty is felt by the pea&s;ant as well as the poet, and the po&s;tillion's coat was as great an homage to Jeanette's charms as a &s;onnet.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="035693_0100_1006488305B47300">When &s;he took her &s;eat &s;he apologi&s;ed to the pa&s;|&s;engers with mode&s;t conde&s;cen&s;ion for incommo|ding them. It was impo&s;&s;ible to be angry with her, and they willingly made room.&mdash;A &s;tage-coach is often a place where a young woman, like <HI>Gre&s;&s;et's Vert-vert,</HI> finds her&s;elf in bad company. Jeanette had already experienced this the fir&s;t time &s;he went to Mun&s;ter to her aunt. Scarcely had &s;he now taken her &s;eat, therefore, when &s;he began unob&s;er|ved to examine the phy&s;iognomies of her fellow-travellers, to di&s;cover what &s;he had to hope or to fear.</P>
<P>This &s;urvey (for which the penetrating, infallible eye of a woman requires only a &s;econd, were the coach &s;tuffed as full as Noah's ark) gave her great &s;atisfaction, as &s;he &s;aw four or five grave old men who had the appearance of merchants, and did not &s;eem inclined to interrupt her melancholy medita|tions. In&s;tead of &s;aluting her, they had only pul|led up their night-caps a little, and one of them offered Jeanette a pinch of &s;nuff. This how<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, was all; they gave them&s;elves no farther concern about her.</P>
<P>She felt a &s;trong de&s;ire to a&s;k the per&s;on who had offered to &s;hare the contents of his &s;nuff-box with her, to what place the coach was going. She was afraid, however, of betraying by this que&s;tion that &s;he was &s;etting out in the wide world without object or provi&s;ion, and by that means attracting attention. She therefore remained &s;ilent; her companions continued &s;ilent al&s;o, and &s;eemed as if they were calculating the profit or lo&s;s of an ad|venture. The gloomy &s;ilence, which was inter|rupted only by an exclamation of "God ble&s;s us!" when any of the company happened to &s;neeze, cheri&s;hed Jeanette's melancholy; and the jolting and rattling of the carriage could not withdraw her from her comfortle&s;s reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="035693_0101_100648854C64F940">For the fir&s;t two days they travelled only through villages and little towns, the names of which were utterly unknown to Jeanette, as &s;he had never troubled her&s;elf much about geography. As &s;he had no opportunity in the&s;e ob&s;cure places to at|tain the object &s;he had in view, &s;he pur&s;ued her journey. On the evening of the third day, as &s;he gazed pen&s;ively on the fields and trees on the right hand, which &s;eemed to recede from the coach, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;tarted, and with difficulty &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a loud &s;hriek.</P>
<P>William rode pa&s;t the carriage!&mdash;His hor&s;e moved on at a &s;luggi&s;h trot; William's head was re|clined upon his brea&s;t, and his eyes &s;eemed to be &s;o intent on the pummel of his &s;addle, that he ne|ver once looked at the &s;tage-coach. Indeed he could not have &s;een Jeanette, as &s;he &s;at back in a corner. A &s;ingle glance was enough for a lover, and &s;he would have pledged her &s;alvation that it was William. How it appeared evident, that in|&s;tead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying from him him &s;he was running directly into his arms.</P>
<P>"My God! what &s;hall I do now?&mdash;At the next &s;tage the carriage will be emptied, I mu&s;t di&s;mount, and perhaps meet William at the door!"</P>
<P>She became re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y on her &s;eat, her face glowed, her heart beat. The nearer they ap|proached the &s;tage, the more violent her anxiety be|came. One of the pa&s;&s;engers happened to a&s;k the po&s;tillion, "Friend, have we far yet to go?"&mdash;"Half a mile farther yet," replied the po&s;tillion, Jeanette was alarmed, and formed an ha&s;ty re&s;olution. "Stop, friend!" cried &s;he &s;uddenly. The po&s;til|lion &s;topped. She took up her bundle, put half a guinea into the po&s;tillion's hand, and bade him drive on.</P>
<P>"What a God's name do you mean, Mi&s;s? What! It is almo&s;t dark. You don't mean to &s;tay here on the road all night.?"</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="035693_0102_10064887069CB7F0">"In the next village I am at home," returned Jeanette; "drive on if you plea&s;e without me." The po&s;tillion &s;hook his head, mounted his hor&s;e, cracked his whip, and in a few minutes the carri|age di&s;appeared from Jeanette's view. She looked after it with a kind of &s;tupefaction; and when &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf alone and helple&s;s amid&s;t all nature, when &s;he heard the cricket chirrup its evening &s;ong, and the gra&s;shopper buzzing in the bu&s;hes, &s;he be|gan to weep bitterly.</P>
<P>"Poor girl! what will now become of you?&mdash; Return?&mdash;Whither?&mdash;Advance&mdash;Alas! Wil|liam!"&mdash;She paced on a little way upon the high road, till on the left hand &s;he &s;aw a little foot-path, which &s;he followed without farther con&s;ideration, and in &s;ecret prayer &s;he proceeded.</P>
<P>Hitherto twilight had &s;hed a feeble ray upon the pathway, but night darkened round, and &s;he found her&s;elf at the entrance of a thick wood. A few moments &s;he &s;tood irre&s;olute, but her courage re|vived. "This foot-path," thought &s;he, "mu&s;t lead to the abode of men. I mu&s;t &s;urely find &s;ome village, or at lea&s;t a farm-hou&s;e, and the deeper in the wood the better." At fir&s;t &s;he pur&s;ued her way with &s;pirit; but the darkne&s;s every moment increa&s;|ed, and the &s;ullen &s;ilence was interrupted only by the di&s;tant cooing of the wood-pigeon. She felt a fearful oppre&s;&s;ion &s;teal round her heart which &s;he had never before experienced. She redoubled her &s;peed, and terror lent her new &s;trength.</P>
<P>Till now &s;he thought that &s;ee had ob&s;erved the marks of a beaten foot-path; but at length her progre&s;s became &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed by the thick twining bu&s;hes, that &s;he began to fear &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e the path altogether. Alas! what &s;he feared &s;oon hap|pened. She &s;uddenly found her&s;elf in a &s;mall opening, bare of trees; and where all around the pines and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs entwined their branches, the &s;hrubs
<PB N="105" REF="035693_0103_1006487B5BDAE3D0">
oppo&s;ed their clo&s;e-grown twigs, and appri&s;ed her that here no human foot had &s;moothed a pa&s;&s;age. Terror now deprived her of &s;trength and reflec|tion: &s;he groped round as if &s;truck blind, and was unable to find the path by which &s;he had come. Trembling, &s;he &s;unk down upon the root of a tree, and recommended her&s;elf to God and to his angels.</P>
<P>In about an hour the moon ro&s;e, and with it a beam of hope in her &s;oul. She ro&s;e, and cho&s;e the place where it &s;eemed ea&s;ie&s;t to penetrate through the bu&s;hes. After &s;he had wrought her way through with great per&s;everance for a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, her hands &s;cratched and bloody, and her white cloak torn to pieces on the thorns, &s;he came to a hedge, which, as far as the feeb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> light of the moon enabled her to judge, &s;eemed to border a &s;tack of hay. "God be prai&s;ed!" exclaimed &s;he, "here mu&s;t be the habitation of men!" She had not advanced many &s;teps farther when &s;he really &s;aw a light at a di&s;tance. "Ha! a light! &s;he ha&s;tily cried, and felt her &s;trength invigorated. With renewed courage &s;he followed the &s;ide of the hedge, advanced towards the light, and &s;oon per|ceived that it i&s;&s;ued from the window of a little hou&s;e which was thatched with &s;traw, but yet had a better appearance than common cottages. It was &s;urrounded by a few out-hou&s;es, and &s;kirted all round by the wood.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. THE HUMORIST.</HEAD>
<P>MAN, who now no longer has a window in his brea&s;t, nor carries a mark upon his forehead (&s;hould he even have killed a brother,) yet in two ways di&s;plays his character with con&s;iderable preci|&s;ion, namely by his <HI>&acirc;re&s;s</HI> and his <HI>habitation.</HI> He who&s;e head is clear, and who&s;e heart is tranquil loves to dre&s;s him&s;elf with ta&s;te, and to live in a plea&s;ant &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. Only the enthu&s;ia&s;t or the mi&s;er|able bury them&s;elves in de&s;arts.</P>
<P>Such thoughts as the&s;e lay heavy upon Jeanette's brea&s;t when &s;he &s;aw the little hou&s;e in the mid&s;t of the wood. "Could I but find an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ylum here; could I but be allowed here to attach my&s;elf to &s;ome unfortunate being, who flies from envy and per&s;e|cution as I fly from love!"</P>
<P>She advanced a few &s;teps nearer till &s;he came to an aged oak, which &s;haded a &s;eat formed of turf. Higher up on the trunk of the tree &s;omething glit|tered in the light of the moon. It was a white board with &s;ome in&s;cription, and fa&s;tened to the tree by a gilt thong. Jeanette &s;tepped up on the bench, and by the moonlight read the following lines in French:
<Q><L>La plainte e&s;t pour le fat, le bruit e&s;t pour le &s;ot;</L>
<L>L'honn&ecirc;te homme trompe s'eloigne, et ne dit mot.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fool complains, the knave makes a noi&s;e; but the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> man decei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed retires and &s;ays nothing.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>"Ha!" exclaimed Jeanette, "here lives &s;ome mortal who has quarreled with the world; he will not &s;hut his door upon the wretched."</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="035693_0105_1006488DD7E34BA0">Animated with hope, &s;he leaped down from the bench, and went &s;traight to the hou&s;e-door. A large dog with a chain about his neck &s;uddenly ru&s;h|ed out of his kennel, and bawled out like a review|er. Jeanette was frightened, and did not venture to approach. She &s;tood like a young ba&s;hful au|thor, whom the reviewer denies admittance into the temple of fame, the &s;acred rece&s;&s;es of which he him&s;elf enters as little as the watch-dog the hou&s;e of his ma&s;ter. Both are kept only to bark, and to growl at every &s;tranger.</P>
<P>At the noi&s;e which the dog made, Jeanette thought &s;he &s;aw the light in the hou&s;e move pa&s;t the window. She heard a bolt drawn; the door opened, a man looked out, &s;aid "Tu&s;h, <HI>Fagel!</HI>" to the dog; and when the bark &s;oftened into a lower growl, the woodman turned to the place where the white figure of Jeanette glanced in his eye, and cried: "Who is there?"&mdash;Jeanette told in a few words that &s;he had lo&s;t her way, and begged a night's lodging.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger an&s;wered not a word. He went in and &s;hut the door behind him. The poor wander|er could not conceive what this meant. The cur again began to rage as before; the light appeared to be placed in its old &s;ituation; and, except the dog, nobody &s;eemed to think of her being there.</P>
<P>After a few minutes of anxious expectation, the light again moved through the hou&s;e; the bolt was withdrawn, the door grated on its hinges, the man who had before come out, made his appearance, &s;aid "Tu&s;h, <HI>Fagel!</HI>" to the dog, and to Jeanette two words: "Come in."&mdash;Jeanette followed. She now perceived by the light of the lamp that her con|ductor was an old man, with a blue jacket and clo&s;e cut hair. He did not appear to &s;hare the curio&s;ity with which &s;he viewed him, as he &s;carcely once looked at her. He led her into a little room adjoining to
<PB N="108" REF="035693_0106_10064890E94F2648">
the lobby. "Here is a bed," &s;aid he; put the lamp on the table, and retired.</P>
<P>Jeanette knew not well what to think of this ex|traordinary reception. She examined the room, in which a kind of indigent cleanline&s;s &s;eemed to pre|vail. The furniture con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;mall folding bed with fine bed-clothes, a looking-gla&s;s with a brown frame, two tables covered with green cloth, and &s;ix &s;traw-bottomed chairs. The floor was &s;trewed with white &s;and and new cut fir branches. The only articles which &s;eemed to indicate the owner to be a man of property, were four valuable land&s;capes by <HI>Wouvermann,</HI> which were fixed to the wall.</P>
<P>When &s;he ob&s;erved that all was quiet in the hou&s;e, and that nobody thought any thing more of her, &s;he threw her&s;elf in her clothes upon the bed; and exhau&s;ted by three &s;leeple&s;s nights, by bodily exertion and mental di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he enjoyed a pretty calm night's re&s;t. The day was well advanced when &s;he was awaked by a noi&s;e in the room. It was the &s;ame &s;ilent man who had attended her the night before. He entered with a ba&s;ket, from which, without &s;aying a word, he drew a white cloth, and &s;pread it upon the table. He then pla|ced upon it bread, butter, chee&s;e, honey, a ba&s;on of milk, and a gla&s;s of &s;mall beer. "Here is break|fa&s;t," &s;aid he, and again withdrew.</P>
<P>This laconic invitation extorted a &s;mile from Jeanette. She remained lying on the bed for half an hour, and puzzled her&s;elf with conjectures to ac|count for the &s;ingular behaviour of her ho&s;t. She then ro&s;e, and refre&s;hed her&s;elf with bread and milk. As &s;he happened to look out at the win|dow, &s;he ob&s;erved another man, about forty years of age, in a grey coat, and &s;hort hair like the other. He &s;at upon the turf &s;eat under the oak, reading a book. His pale, haggard countenance bore the traces of &s;orrow; his eyes were hollow, and &s;haded
<PB N="109" REF="035693_0107_1006489477624C88">
with &s;haggy eyebrows, which gave his features a gloomy character mixed with &s;omething of wild|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Jeanette con&s;idered him long with attention. She concluded that he was the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e; and &s;he re&s;olved, as &s;oon as he gave up reading, to throw her&s;elf in his way, to thank him for his ho&s;pitable entertainment, and to offer her&s;elf to him as maid-&s;ervant. The man in grey, however, did not &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to quit his place. Sometimes indeed, he laid a&s;ide his book, &s;troked a &s;paniel, or cut a piece of hazle, in doing which he lo&s;t him|&s;elf in meditation; he would then take up the book again, though he &s;eemed to read but little.</P>
<P>About mid-day the &s;ervant, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch Jeanette con|&s;idered the man in the blue jacket, placed a table under the oak tree, and carried out a few frugal di&s;hes, of which the man in grey &s;paringly partook. Immediately after the &s;ervant brought the &s;ame fare to Jeanette, and &s;aid: "Here is dinner," and went away. "The&s;e men," thought Jeanette, "are not curious. It appears to be very indiffer|ent to them who I am. I however am very anxi|ous to know who the per&s;on is to whom I owe this a&s;ylum."</P>
<P>When the &s;ervant returned to clear the table, &s;he ventured, for the fir&s;t time, to a&s;k him a que&s;tion: "Where am I?"&mdash;"Among hone&s;t people," re|turned the man, and went his way. Jeanette con|cluded that &s;peech was here u&s;ed only as a nece&s;&s;a|ry, and not, as at court, as a luxury. Notwith|&s;tanding her de&s;ire to gratify her female curio&s;ity, &s;he felt a repugnance equally &s;trong to hara&s;s by her que&s;tions; and &s;he &s;truggled with her&s;elf the whole morning, whether &s;he &s;hould go out and &s;peak to the man in grey. More than once &s;he had the door in her hand; but after &s;he had &s;ummoned courage to make her propo&s;als, &s;he perceived that the &s;tran|ger
<PB N="110" REF="035693_0108_1006489763FA7EB8">
had left his &s;eat, and hid him&s;elf in the woods.</P>
<P>The &s;hades of evening clo&s;ed around. The man in the blue jacket brought a lamp, and &s;aid: "Here is a light." In a little white he covered the table in &s;ilence; and when he had placed the victuals upon it, he retired, &s;aying: "Here is your &s;upper." The conver&s;ation for the day there clo&s;ed. Jeanet|te remained alone, neither &s;aw nor heard any thing farther, and &s;lept as well as &s;he could till next morn|ing.</P>
<P>When next day her breakfa&s;t was placed on the table, and &s;he had begun to eat, the mono&s;yllabic man in blue &s;aid: "Now you may go. The road on the left hand takes you out of the wood."&mdash; "Alas! my friend!" &s;aid Jeanette, "does your ma&s;ter want no &s;ervant girl?"&mdash;The man in blue for the fir&s;t time looked her broad in the face, an|&s;wered however not a word, but went out to his ma&s;ter, who was &s;eated under the oak-tree. In a few minutes he returned, and &s;aid: "No. The left hand road takes you out of the wood."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall go this moment," &s;aid Jeanette with a &s;igh; "but may I not be permitted to return your ma&s;ter my thanks?"&mdash;"No!" was the rough an|&s;wer with which the man in blue left her. Melan|choly and di&s;con&s;olate &s;he went to the window, every moment thought of preparing to &s;et out, and &s;till po&s;tponed it. "Where &s;hall I find an a&s;ylum &s;o peculiarly adapted for the gloomy temper of my &s;orrow? The bu&s;tle of cities, the ceremony of great hou&s;es, the importunity of talkative men&mdash;and here&mdash;this dreary wilderne&s;s, the &s;olemn firs, the dome&s;tic &s;ilence&mdash;O! he mu&s;t retain me; the &s;trange mortal there under the oak mu&s;t take me into his &s;ervice."</P>
<P>Suddenly &s;he felt, as it were, &s;omething whi&s;per her: "To &s;ucceed in your object with &s;ingular characters you mu&s;t your&s;elf act in a &s;ingular man|ner."
<PB N="111" REF="035693_0109_1006489A96338478">
&mdash;The day before &s;he had accidentally ob&s;erv|ed, that at this hour the &s;ervant had brought &s;ome pails out of an adjoining hou&s;e, taken them to the well, and wa&s;hed them clean. He had then gone into a little &s;hed where a couple of cows were kept, milked them, and brought the milk into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On this di&s;covery, Jeanette immediately formed her plan. She ha&s;tily pinned up her gown, went out without he&s;itation, carefully avoided looking at the man in grey as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed him under the oak-tree, went into the out-hou&s;e, took the pails, and wa&s;hed them clean at the well. She then po&s;ted to the &s;hed, milked the cows, and proceeded to carry the milk into the hou&s;e. All this &s;he did with the &s;ame neatne&s;s and dexterity as if &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to it all her life.</P>
<P>The man in grey dropped his book upon his knees, and eyed her with &s;urpri&s;e. When &s;he came out of the &s;hed and was pa&s;&s;ing by him, he &s;aid: "What is the meaning of this?"</P>
<P>"Good Sir!"&mdash;"I am no good Sir! But I am a man!"&mdash;"Alas! I am unfortunate."&mdash;"Who is not &s;o?"&mdash;"I wi&s;h to remain with you as maid-&s;ervant."&mdash;"I want no maid-&s;ervant."&mdash;"If you do not want me&mdash;Ah! good Sir! I &s;tand in need of you!"</P>
<P>The man in grey remained a few moments &s;ilent. "Peter!" cried he to the &s;ervant, "the girl may &s;tay." After the&s;e words he took up the book, and took no farther notice of Jeanette.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. IMPROVEMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>AN old Latin proverb maintains, that the &s;ame con&s;equence does not always follow when two men perform the &s;ame action; and this ob&s;er|vation holds as true in the woods of We&s;tphalia as in the city of Rome. If nature is adorned with youth, beauty, gentlene&s;s and grace, the fortunate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the&s;e advantages may boldly undertake what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> old wrinkled beldame dur&s;t not attempt. Had not Jeanette been a lovely girl, had not her hand excelled the milk in whitene&s;s, and her form tran&s;cended the elegance of the poplars, perhaps the man in grey might have con&s;idered her unbid|den officiou&s;ne&s;s as extremely impertinent and di&s;|agreeable. But it was impo&s;&s;ible to meet the glance of the lovely girl's fine benignant eye, without feel|ing &s;ome emotion of kindne&s;s, though you had been &s;tretched on a bed of thorns. When you &s;aw her you felt the &s;ame effects which <HI>Moritz,</HI> in his Mag|azine of Moral Experiments, mentions to have been produced by the glowing tints of an even|ing &s;ky. A melancholy man was walking one fine &s;ummer evening up and down upon the Mall, with his face fir&s;t turned towards the ea&s;t, where the &s;ky was dark and gloomy. Corroding care and di&s;gu&s;t of life filled his brea&s;t. Suddenly he turned round&mdash;The &s;oft beauties of the purple we&s;tern &s;ky &s;aluted his view. Hope, love, and con|fidence awoke in his &s;oul.</P>
<P>The man in grey would not li&s;ten to Jeanette's thanks. He &s;aid; "O! very well!" and beckon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="113" REF="035693_0111_100648A168E68138">
with his hand for her to retire. He conceived that he had performed a pure duty of humanity, ab&s;tracted from all collateral feelings and views. "She is unfortunate," thought he, "and imagines that it is po&s;&s;ible in this world to enjoy happine&s;s. Happy for her! &s;o long as &s;he continues to cheri&s;h this dream!&mdash;But what misfortunes can &s;he have &s;u&s;|tained?&mdash;O! 'tis all one! What is it to me?"&mdash; He continued to read, but &s;oon perceived that he knew nothing of what he had been reading. "My thoughts wander," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, put his book in his pocket, and plunged, as was his cu&s;tom, deep|er into the wood.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Jeanette went cheerily about her new occupation. She took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kitchen, ar|ranged every thing in the neate&s;t order, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d and burni&s;hed what was not &s;ufficiently bright, cleaned the pots, put water on the fire, ingeniou&s;ly made her&s;elf a &s;cuttle of twigs, which &s;he pealed with her fair hands. All this &s;he did without &s;aying a word; for &s;he had already ob&s;erved that in this hou&s;e <HI>&s;ilence</HI> was the greate&s;t recommendation, and &s;he was de|termined to &s;hew the man in grey, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary to bani&s;h the fair &s;ex from his &s;olitude on account of their reputed deficiency in this virtue.</P>
<P>Peter &s;tood and gazed at her. He &s;aid not a word indeed, but he &s;miled kindly, and &s;ometimes with a half nod muttered Ha! hem! However eagerly Jeanette longed to know where, and in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he was, &s;he reflected that her &s;ilent ho&s;t had &s;till a better right to anticipate her curious inquiries; and as he allowed her to remain undi&s;|turbed, &s;he thought it fair to ob&s;erve a &s;imilar de|licacy.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed a whole month without a human voice being heard in the &s;olitude. Every hour of the day was dedicated to its appropriate employ|ment, every employment had its e&s;tabli&s;hed form&punc;
<PB N="114" REF="035693_0112_100648A58E256620">
Good morning! Good night! were expre&s;&s;ed with a nod of the head, and at mo&s;t by a &s;ingle word. The di&s;hes required for dinner were &s;ettled and communicated to Jeanette by their bare appella|tions. Never once had they inquired her name. When &s;he was called, it was, Girl!&mdash;The man in grey was called Ma&s;ter, and the valet was called Peter.</P>
<P>Jeanette endeavored, by every little attention, to win the favor of her new ma&s;ter. She had now cau&s;e to rejoice that her old aunt at Mun&s;ter had initiated her in the my&s;teries of cookery. From the happy days of her youth &s;he had &s;till cheri&s;hed her propen&s;ity for gardening. She was &s;killed in rearing fruits and flowers; and every thing, as for|merly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouri&s;hed in her hands.</P>
<P>In a corner of the kitchen-garden &s;he cho&s;e a &s;pot of good rich &s;oil for a flower-plot. "Peter," &s;aid &s;he, "take the &s;pade and dig me this &s;pot." Peter looked at her, &s;miled, muttered, with a half nod, Hem! hem! ha! and prepared the ground as he was de&s;ired. In a &s;hort time, ro&s;es and hyacinths began to &s;hoot up, which Jeanette carefully watered every evening. When they began to perfume the air with their full-blown beauties, &s;he tran&s;planted them into flower-pots, and &s;tuck them in the ground, by the turf bench, round the oak-tree. When the man in grey repaired next morning, as, u&s;ual, to his favorite &s;pot, it &s;eemed as if during the night, ro&s;es and hyacinths had &s;prung up under his feet.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t ob&s;erved this little piece of gallant|ry, he &s;tood a good while gazing at it. Peter brought breakfa&s;t, and his ma&s;ter pointed with his finger to the ro&s;es. Peter under&s;tood him, and an&s;wered, "The girl."</P>
<P>"The girl!" involuntarily repeated the man in grey, and a &s;mile e&s;caped him which &s;till pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound his li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with a ca&s;t of &s;everity.

a guinea, gave it to Peter, and &s;aid "The girl." Peter carried the money, with the words, "From ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>"For what?"&mdash;"For the flowers."&mdash;"If the flowers afford ma&s;ter any plea&s;ure, I am rewarded. Kindne&s;s cannot be purcha&s;ed with gold."</P>
<P>Peter looked at her with a little a&s;toni&s;hment, and for the fir&s;t time in his life clapped her on her &s;houl|der. He carried the money back, laid it on the table, and &s;aid: "She refu&s;es."&mdash;"Why?"</P>
<P>She &s;ays, "If the flowers have afforded ma&s;ter any plea&s;ure, &s;he is rewarded. Kindne&s;s is not to be purcha&s;ed with money."&mdash;"Said &s;he &s;o?"&mdash; "Yes."</P>
<P>This time the countenance of the man in grey relaxed into a &s;mile, in which the &s;everity was al|mo&s;t totally eclip&s;ed. Thus did Jeanette avail her|&s;elf of every opportunity which pre&s;ented to &s;mooth the brow or the humouri&s;t. He was not ungrate|ful; he was &s;en&s;ible of the effort, though he long remained &s;ilent. When &s;he pa&s;&s;ed him in the morn|ing to milk the cows, he could not refrain from lifting his eyes from the book, and looking after her. This &s;tolen plea&s;ure had, without his being aware of it, become &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to him, that, if &s;he happened to be longer in coming than u&s;ual, his eye wandered an hundred times from the book to the hou&s;e-door, to catch her dear form. This, however, was all. In the &s;ame uniformity pa&s;&s;ed a quarter of a year. Jeanette could not help feel|ing her female vanity a little hurt, that with all her efforts, and all her attention, &s;he had not been able to intere&s;t the man in grey &s;o far as to inquire her name. At la&s;t, however, &s;he hit upon a thought, the execution of which at fir&s;t appeared extremely difficult, but which &s;ucceeded beyond her hopes.</P>
<P>"Who made the tablet which hangs on the oak?" &s;aid &s;he one day to Peter.&mdash;"It was I."&mdash;"And
<PB N="116" REF="035693_0114_100648ADCE234B10">
who painted the in&s;cription?"&mdash;"I."&mdash;"Are you a painter?"&mdash;"I was in my youth."</P>
<P>"I am glad of that. Make me &s;uch a tablet." Peter looked and &s;miled. "Are you &s;erious?"&mdash; "Yes. You mu&s;t &s;ay nothing of it, however, to your ma&s;ter. I wi&s;h to procure him an unexpec|ted plea&s;ure." Peter laughed, again muttered hem! hem! and made the tablet. When it was ready, Jeanette gave him a &s;tanza to be in&s;cribed upon it. Peter wrought <HI>con amore,</HI> and &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. The kind thanks with which Jeanette repaid his trouble gave him more &s;atisfaction than the celebrated <HI>Ca&s;anova</HI> enjoys in a pre&s;ent from the Semiramis of the North.</P>
<P>When the man in grey, according to cu&s;tom, &s;lipped out one morning to the turf &s;eat under the oak-tree, and happened to look up to the trunk, be|hold! the old tablet was taken away; in its place hung a new one, on which he read, with great &s;ur|pri&s;e, the following words:
<Q><L>Ne te vante point d'avoir en cet a&s;yle</L>
<L>Rencontr&eacute; le parfait bonheur.</L>
<L>Il n'e&s;t point retire dans le fond d'un bocage,</L>
<L>Il e&s;t moins chez les rois,</L>
<L>Il e&s;t encore moins chez le &s;age;</L>

<P>He read it over twice, three times, and could &s;carcely believe his eyes. Peter brought breakfa&s;t, his ma&s;ter pointed with his finger to the tablet. Peter under&s;tood the ge&s;ture, and replied with a &s;mile, "<HI>The girl.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="035693_0115_100648B2C222D448">"<HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> involuntarily repeated the man in grey, and &s;miled without any mixture of &s;everity. When Jeanette pa&s;&s;ed by, quite unconcerned, a &s;hort time after, to pay her morning vi&s;it to the cows, he could no longer maintain his re&s;erve. "Girl!" cried he.&mdash;"Sir," replied Jeanette, and turned round to him.</P>
<P>"Who are you?"&mdash;"I am unfortunate."&mdash;"Can you tell me no more?"&mdash;"Excu&s;e me."&mdash;"Well, I am not di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the unfortunate take ref|uge with me. Will you remain with me till I die?" &mdash;"Mo&s;t willingly."&mdash;"What is your name?"&mdash; "Jeanette."&mdash;"Well, you may go." Jeanette with|drew.</P>
<P>The man in grey had not &s;poken &s;o much at one time for many years. He was &s;urpri&s;ed, even him|&s;elf, at the effort, and fell into a profound medita|tion, in which he forgot his morning walk. What was the preci&s;e &s;ubject of his reflections, kind reader, he ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntured to communicate even to the oak-tree; and perhaps he him&s;elf did not exact|ly know. This explanation, however, produced no alteration in the mode of life of the hermit and his dome&s;tics. Every thing moved on in its u&s;ual cour&s;e; and except the new in&s;cription upon the oak, every thing remained in its former place.</P>
<P>Winter had now &s;tripped the leaves from the trees, covered Jeanette's flower-garden with &s;now, and kept the man in grey confined to his chamber. To the want of exerci&s;e, perhaps, it was owing that &s;ecret grief, and ince&s;&s;ant brooding over a &s;ilent &s;orrow, affected his health this &s;ea&s;on more than he had before experienced.

di&s;tre&s;s. Jeanette never &s;tirred from his bed. Botany, formerly the amu&s;ement her youth, &s;he now employed with advantage. In the morning &s;he prepared him cooling draughts, and made him drink potions made from the juice of the mo&s;t agreea|ble and &s;alutary fruits. For dinner &s;he made him light vegetable &s;oups; in the evening &s;he took a book from his &s;mall but &s;elect library, and read till he fell a&s;leep. She then lay down, without throwing off her clothes, on a &s;ofa in the adjoining room, and if the patient but &s;tirred &s;he was with him in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>By her unwearied care his health was in a few weeks re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. He appeared &s;till, it is true, as formerly, pen&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;erved. His counte|nance, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no longer moro&s;e and mi&s;an|thropic. He was &s;ilen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> indeed, as before, but his &s;ilence &s;eemed to be con&s;trained.</P>
<P>"Go to Jeanette's chamber," &s;aid he one morn|ing to Peter, "and lay this pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on her table." Peter did as he was de&s;ired. Jeanette found the pur&s;e, and ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed from whom it came.</P>
<P>"Go to your ma&s;ter's room," &s;aid &s;he to Peter, "and lay this pur&s;e upon his table." Peter obey|ed, and the pur&s;e was &s;ent three times backwards and forwards, without any farther explanation taking place upon the &s;ubject. The man in grey was at la&s;t obliged to put up his pur&s;e again in his pocket. In the evening, as he &s;tood at the window, with his face to the ca&s;ement, and his back to Jea|nette, he began, contrary to cu&s;tom, to whi&s;tle a tune. Suddenly he &s;topped, and without turning round &s;aid, in a low he&s;itating voice: "you take no money?"</P>
<P>"No!" replied Jeanette. The man in grey continued to whi&s;tle, and beat time with his fin|gers upon the gla&s;s, but &s;aid not a word more.</P>
<P>Next day, however, at dinner-time, when Peter
<PB N="119" REF="035693_0117_100648B9F708E5D0">
began to cover the table, his ma&s;ter &s;aid, "Lay two covers." Peter &s;tarted, and remained &s;tanding in the middle of his work, like a clock run out, till his ma&s;ter gravely repeated the order. He then placed the two covers, without &s;aying a word, and thought with him&s;elf that company mu&s;t be com|ing. No gue&s;t appeared, however, and dinner was &s;erved up.</P>
<P>"Call Jeanette!"&mdash;Jeanette appeared.&mdash;"Sit down, and dine with me."</P>
<P>Jeanette felt the kindne&s;s of this behaviour. She &s;at down, and attempted to eat; but the tears &s;tart|ed in her eye, and &s;he could not &s;wallow a mor|&s;el. The man in grey threw a &s;tolen glance at her. "Why do you weep?" &s;aid he. Jeanette ro&s;e, and ran out of the room.</P>
<P>"She is a good girl!" muttered the hermit; a &s;mile played round his lips, but in&s;tead of the for|mer &s;everity it was blended with a look of &s;orrow.</P>

<P>The hermitage of the man in grey by degrees lo&s;t its gloomy a&s;pect. A groupe of tall firs, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the hou&s;e, intercepted the pa&s;&s;age of the cheering rays of the morning &s;un. This was pre|ci&s;ely to his mind, as he fled from the light of the

The man in grey bowed to the authority, as a loyal old Frenchman would have done to a di&s;agreeable order announced <HI>de par le Roi.</HI></P>
<P>Two hundred paces from the hou&s;e lay a little hillock, overgrown with thick bu&s;hes and &s;hrubbery. When &s;pring began to open the leaves on the trees, Jeanette reque&s;ted the ever obliging Peter to clear the top of the hillock, and to leave only as much as was nece&s;&s;ary to form a bower. The ivy, the je&s;|&s;amine, and the honey-&s;uckles were arched over a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urf bank.

<P>He &s;aid nothing; but, when Jeanette retired a few &s;teps to pull a bunch of May-flowers, he turn|ed round, and nodded to Peter with an inqui&s;itive air. Peter nodded and winked. Another time, Jeanette privately bought a nightingale from a country girl. This was a bird rarely &s;een in this part of the wood, where only owls &s;creeched and hawks &s;creamed. She hung the &s;weet &s;inger, in the evening, under the window of her ma&s;ter's bed|room. The bird began his melodious &s;ong, now in plaintive, now in joyous notes. The man in grey

awoke from his fir&s;t &s;lumber, li&s;tened, wondered, and rejoiced at this unu&s;ual vi&s;it; and he even wi&s;h|ed that the nightingale might not be a pa&s;&s;ing gue&s;t, but that it might build a ne&s;t in the garden.</P>
<P>When he opened the window next morning, he perceived from whence the &s;erenade had proceeded. Peter brought up breakfa&s;t, and his ma&s;ter had al|ready lifted up his hand, as u&s;ual, to point to the object the appearance of which had excited his &s;urpri&s;e; but he drew back his hand.

It was anxiety to obtain this endearing appellation which had anima|ted all her exertions, and every day &s;eemed more and more to promi&s;e her complete &s;ucce&s;s. Since the period when &s;he had &s;o di&s;intere&s;tedly refu&s;ed the fee which her medical care had earned, &s;he commonly dined at table with her ma&s;ter. With|out her knowledge, he &s;ent Peter into the next vil|lage, to hire a pea&s;ant girl to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. He no longer &s;uffered her to do any work that had the appearance of drudgery. In the evening &s;he par|ticipated in his hours of reading and with the mo&s;t

Sometimes even he conde&s;cended to li&s;ten to the humorous adventures of Gil Blas. In a word, after the lap&s;e of a twelvemonth, he as little re&s;embled the man in grey of the la&s;t ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as the bare ro&s;e-bu&s;h which you bring out of the cellar re&s;embles the ro&s;e-bu&s;h that in a few weeks di&s;plays its foliage, and &s;preads its blo&s;&s;oms to the &s;un.</P>
<P>He was con&s;cious of this change, and his heart opened to tender &s;en&s;ations. How dear Jeanette had become to him, and what might be the con|&s;equence of the attachment, he had never reflected; and an opportunity alone was wanting to appri&s;e him of the true nature of his feelings.</P>
<P>Since the bower on the top of the hillock had been reared, he had, in a great mea&s;ure, de&s;erted his former favourite &s;pot, the turf bank under the oak-tree. He often &s;tole, well plea&s;ed, through the fields, and hied by the winding path to the top of the hill, where an unconfined pro&s;pect no lon|ger, as formerly, was di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>One day, as he was approaching the bower with &s;ilent &s;teps, he thought he heard an unu&s;ual noi&s;e. He li&s;tened, and he imagined he heard &s;ome one &s;ob. By a &s;udden turn he entered the bower, and di&s;covered Jeanette in tears. She had been think|ing of William, and her tears flowed to ab&s;ence and to love. She &s;tarted up, and endeavoured to force a &s;mile. The man in grey, however, looked her keenly in the face. "Jeanette," &s;aid he, "you weep!" She could not an&s;wer.&mdash;"Are you &s;till unhappy?"</P>
<P>"Alas! No! I am as happy as I can ever be upon earth."</P>

<P>"Do you mean this &s;eriou&s;ly?"&mdash;"I &s;hould hate my&s;elf if I thought differently; I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf if I could act differently."&mdash;A pau&s;e en&s;ued.

<P>"Were you to know that, you would expel me from this &s;olitude, the only a&s;ylum which is now left me."</P>
<P>"With you, then, I &s;hould bani&s;h the happi|ne&s;s of my life." And a violent glow ru&s;hed to his cheeks, as if he had been a&s;hamed of this invol|untary confe&s;&s;ion.

<P>THE following day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed in tranquility. Jea|nette had recovered her u&s;ual &s;erenity, but &s;omething &s;eemed to brood in the &s;oul of the man in grey.</P>
<P>"Let us take a walk, dear Jeanette!" &s;aid he in the evening. They went up in &s;ilence to the hill, and &s;at down, as the preceding day, upon the turf bank before they exchanged a word. A long pau&s;e followed. Jeanette looked round with em|barra&s;&s;ment, and twi&s;ted the leaves which hung down from the arching honey&s;uckles. The un|erring penetration which is in&s;eparable from a fe|male mind in ca&s;es of this nature enabled her to anticipate the &s;cene which was impending. The man in grey &s;at with his head reclining upon his brea&s;t, and his heart &s;eemed labouring to be deliv|ered from a heavy burden. "Jeanette!" &s;aid he at la&s;t, "do you &s;till continue in the &s;entiments which you expre&s;&s;ed ye&s;terday?"&mdash;"I &s;hall never entertain any other."&mdash;Then you renounce your William?"</P>
<P>Jeanette with a &s;igh: "I have already renounc|ed him forever!"</P>
<P>The man in grey, with &s;altering voice, and draw|ing figures in the &s;and with his cane, continued: "Will you marry me?"</P>
<P>Jeanette &s;tarted. A que&s;tion &s;o abrupt &s;he had not anticipated. She gazed at the man in grey with a look which te&s;tified &s;ome feeling of horror,
<PB N="126" REF="035693_0124_100648D29EBF5A68">
an emotion quite foreign to the &s;entiments which he had hitherto in&s;pired.</P>
<P>"Ye&s;terday," proceeded he vi&s;ibly relieved, "you honored me with your confidence, and it is ju&s;t that I &s;hould return it. My hi&s;tory you &s;hall hear in a few words.&mdash;I am a Dutchman, and my name is Van Shipper. My father was a rich mer|chant, who loved money beyond every thing in the world. The little cultivation which my mind has received, I owe to my re&s;idence in foreign countries, and to the peru&s;al of good books.</P>
<P>"When I returned home, I had the misfortune to fall in love with a young lady of great beauty. I wi&s;hed to make her my wife, but dur&s;t not gratify my de&s;ire for fear of offending my father. The threat of di&s;inheriting me, added fuel to the flame. I endeavoured to per&s;uade her to elope with me, and would have &s;acrificed for her every expectation of pre&s;ent fortune. Before, however, my plan could be accompli&s;hed, a German coxcomb brought the pe&s;t of &s;entimental cant into her family, and &s;he became faithle&s;s.</P>
<P>"I now exchanged love to the fair &s;ex for love to my country. I became what was called a patri|ot, and was bani&s;hed. A per&s;on of the name of <HI>Fag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l,</HI> whom I had once &s;aved from being drowned at Baden, was my mo&s;t violent per&s;ecutor. I &s;hould have forgotten the worthle&s;s fellow, but that the name of my dog daily reminds me of him. A re|ward was offered for my apprehen&s;ion. My father was dead. I ventured to go &s;ecretly as far as Am|&s;terdam, and lived &s;ome weeks concealed in the hou&s;e of my mother. There I made arrangements for remitting my property out of the country. I had already &s;afely transferred one half of it, when I learnt that I was betrayed by my own mother. Party &s;pirit and fanatici&s;m trample upon the feelings of nature. I was on the point of being arre&s;ted; I
<PB N="127" REF="035693_0125_100648D66CB1AE50">
fled, and tru&s;ted the other half of my property with my own brother, by whom I have been cheated of it. Thus did fate di&s;&s;olve the bands of love, friend|&s;hip, and nature. I remained alone in the world, and in vain opened my arms to catch to my heart a being of congenial di&s;po&s;ition. I then withdrew into this &s;olitude, accompanied by a &s;ingle dome&s;tic, who&s;e &s;tupidity &s;eemed a pledge for his hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>"What I have been able to &s;ave from the wreck of my fortune is far more than I &s;pend, but &s;till le&s;s than my heart requires. Since I have known you, the pa&s;t &s;eems a dream, and the future begins to &s;mile upon me. I cannot live without you. A man like me of eight-and-thirty, rough and forbid|ding withal, can &s;carce venture to pretend to your love. If, however, you are &s;erious in your re&s;olu|tion to &s;pend your life in this &s;eque&s;tered &s;olitude, why not as my wife? as my clo&s;e united friend and companion?&mdash;You have re&s;tored confidence in hu|manity to my brea&s;t, if you con&s;ent to confer hap|pine&s;s and tranquillity upon me, &s;ay the tran&s;port|ing <HI>yes!</HI></P>
<P>"You are &s;ilent?&mdash;You tremble?&mdash;Do I gue&s;s your &s;entiments?&mdash;The heart can love but once!&mdash; No, dear Jeanette, you are mi&s;taken. Try only to make a human being happy, and you will &s;oon con|ceive an attachment to your own work.&mdash;Come, then! accept the hand of an hone&s;t man, and let me ble&s;s the hour which brought you to this wood!"</P>
<P>Jeanette, trembling and blu&s;hing, heard only one half of his narration, and of the apo&s;trophe at the end nothing at all. An hundred times had &s;he &s;e|cretly lamented that the day before &s;he had not been more candid; that &s;he had not di&s;covered all, even at the ri&s;k of being turned once more into the wide world. The man in grey, indeed, was agree|able to her, but the &s;entiment he in&s;pired was not

a-kin to the tender pa&s;&s;ion; his plea&s;ing qualities were not tho&s;e which are rewarded with love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;he really felt for him, however, what he felt for her, and &s;he felt for William, &s;he was incapable of impo&s;ing upon him an innocence which re&s;ided only in her pure &s;oul. She opened her mouth to make a full confe&s;&s;ion, but her tongue refu&s;ed its office, and &s;hame clo&s;ed her lips.</P>
<P>The man in grey looked in her face with pene|trating eyes; he read confu&s;ion and anxiety, but no repugnance. This ob&s;ervation gave him courage, and he became more pre&s;&s;ing. At length, with faltering accents, Jeanette entreated permi&s;&s;ion to give him her an&s;wer in writing. "When?" ex|claimed he eagerly.&mdash;"To-morrow," &s;aid the wretched girl, and ha&s;tened away. He was about to follow her&mdash;She turned round "For goodne&s;s &s;ake leave me alone!"&mdash;He withdrew. She plung|ed into the rece&s;&s;es of the wood, where &s;he wander|ed till it was dark, con&s;idering with her&s;elf in what terms &s;he &s;hould couch her confe&s;&s;ion. The attach|ment of the man in grey flattered her; the lo&s;s of it was inevitable, and it was painful. Yet to lo&s;e his e&s;teem&mdash;the thought was intolerable!&mdash;"But it mu&s;t be &s;o! Better to &s;uffer what I have merited; better to &s;ink to the &s;ituation of a de&s;pi&s;ed woman, than to deceive a worthy man who is my bene|factor."</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed her &s;oliloquies with this deter|mination, &s;he returned to the hermitage. She did not make her appearance in the parlour before Mr. Van Shipper, whom &s;he heard pacing through the room. She prepared &s;upper as expeditiou&s;ly as &s;he could, and retired to her clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Peter covered the table, and laid only one cover. His ma&s;ter pointed to it, and &s;aid: "Why?"&mdash; "The girl does not &s;up."&mdash;"Where is &s;he?"&mdash; "She is in her room."&mdash;"What is &s;he doing?"&mdash;
<PB N="129" REF="035693_0127_100648DD4CEEFD48">
"I can't tell."&mdash;"How does &s;he look?"&mdash;"She has been weeping."&mdash;The man in grey redoubled his &s;trides. Peter placed the di&s;hes on the table, took his &s;tation with his towel under his arm be|hind the chair, and coughed &s;everal times to make his ma&s;ter perceive that &s;upper was waiting. When he found that neither coughing nor &s;tamping the ground produced the effect, he at la&s;t took the freedom to &s;ay: "Supper is cooling." This hint, however, he was obliged to repeat three times be|fore Mr. Van Shipper could be &s;o far rou&s;ed from his reverie as to &s;ay peevi&s;hly: "I don't choo&s;e any &s;upper!" Nine years had Peter lived with his ma&s;ter in this &s;olitude, and never had been treated by him in this manner. It was no wonder, then, that this fir&s;t ebullition of pa&s;&s;ion made a &s;trong im|pre&s;&s;ion on the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll good hearted creature. He began to weep. "Good ma&s;ter!" &s;aid he &s;obbing, "how am I to blame becau&s;e you cannot eat?"</P>
<P>Mr. Van Shipper immediately recollected him|&s;elf. "Go!" &s;aid he, with &s;oftened voice, as he clapped him on the &s;houlder, "go, good Peter! Be not offended with me, I am ill." Peter carried the di&s;hes back to the kitchen, but his appetite was gone al&s;o.</P>
<P>The man in grey continued for two hours to pace backwards and forwards in the room. He was at la&s;t &s;o fatigued that his knees trembled, but he found it impo&s;&s;ible either to &s;it down or go to bed. He burned with curio&s;ity to know whether Jeanet|te was a&s;leep. He &s;lipped &s;oftly through the court, from which he could have a view of her window, which was on the ground floor. There was light in the room. He approached the window, and found the curtain half open. He &s;aw Jeanette writing at a table; often &s;he laid down the pen to wipe her eyes. This picture haunted him in his bed-room, and was not very well calculated to pro|cure him found repo&s;e</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="035693_0128_100648E091D25CD8">The morning &s;un found Jeanette &s;till at the de&s;k. She had now fini&s;hed her &s;tory; &s;he revi&s;ed what &s;he had written, &s;ealed it with trembling hand, and called Peter. The man in grey &s;huddered when he heard her voice. He &s;topped his breath to li&s;ten. Peter now opens the door of Jeanette's room&mdash;he returns, and every &s;tep he advanced, the heart of the anxious expectant beat more violently. The door opened; he &s;aw a letter in Peter's hand, and the la&s;t drops of blood vani&s;hed from his cheeks. Trembling he broke the &s;eal; a mi&s;t ob&s;cured his eyes.</P>
<P>Jeanette, when &s;he had removed this burden from her brea&s;t, went with lightened heart to perform her u&s;ual occupations in the kitchen. She ordered the fire to be kindled, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the maid to gather vegetables in the garden, and, as &s;he prepared din|ner, li&s;tened with beating heart when &s;he heard the lea&s;t noi&s;e in the adjoining room.</P>
<P>After the lap&s;e of an hour, the door opened. Mr. Van Shipper came into the kitchen with Jea|nette's letter in his hand. The poor girl, covered with blu&s;hes, dur&s;t not look up.

<P>Jeanette &s;obbed. Mr. Van Shipper gave the maid a hint to withdraw. "Look at me, dear girl," &s;aid he, and &s;eized her trembling hand.

<P>Alas! poor Jeanette was in a cruel &s;ituation.

It co&s;t floods of tears, and a long &s;truggle between love and gratitude; but love prevailed, and &s;he pronounced an irrevo|cable refu&s;al.</P>

<P>THE &s;orrows of the heart have this in common with corporeal &s;ufferings, that they render us indifferent to life.

<P>One morning he retired, as u&s;ual, into the wood, but did not return at his accu&s;tomed hour to din|ner. Jeanette became unea&s;y; night came, but he did not appear. She waited all night long, but the man in grey &s;till remained ab&s;ent.</P>

<P>"I am &s;orry for that. I did not know that you took &s;o warm an intere&s;t in my life. I thank you for it. It is a cordial drop in the cup of my &s;or|rows!&mdash;Be ea&s;y, ri&s;e, night approaches, let us re|turn home."</P>
<P>Jeanette ro&s;e, and tottered to his arm. She was &s;trongly inclined to a&s;k why he had &s;tolen away &s;o privately? Where and how he had &s;pent the two days he had been ab&s;ent? As he him&s;elf, however, &s;aid nothing on the &s;ubject, &s;he did not venture to put the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Peter came to meet his ma&s;ter, with his eyes red and &s;wollen, ki&s;&s;ed his hand with &s;obs, and in the evening &s;ang, in a very audible voice, in his room, "Prai&s;ed be the Lord, &amp;c."</P>
<P>A few days after this occurrence, the man in grey fell &s;ick. He him&s;elf refu&s;ed to take any no|tice of it, and in&s;i&s;ted that he was very well. But whence that unu&s;ual flu&s;h upon your cheeks? Whence this want of &s;leep and appetite? Whence the&s;e &s;hivering fits which agitate your whole frame? Alas! poor man in grey, in vain you endeavour to
<PB N="134" REF="035693_0132_100648ECF262C5F0">
conceal the violent fever which rages in your veins!</P>
<P>Jeanette, alarmed and di&s;tracted, pre&s;&s;ed him to accept her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, <HI>him</HI> who with joy &s;aw him|&s;elf at the period of his thorny pilgrimage. Every morning &s;he prepared, with the fonde&s;t care and the mo&s;t tender anxiety, the medicines, which he took from her hands with complacency and with thanks. He placed them on the table, however, and allowed them to remain untouched. In vain did the faith|ful Peter entreat leave to call a phy&s;ician from the next town. "You are &s;trange children," would he reply with a &s;mile&mdash;"I am quite well." Never had he been more &s;erene or more affable than now; he even &s;ometimes indulged a joke. This pierced Jeanette to the heart. Bitter reproaches would have affected her le&s;s than the &s;ilent anxiety which he di&s;covered to conceal his &s;orrow.</P>
<P>He continued the&s;e exertions till at la&s;t nature was too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted. He was obliged to confine him&s;elf to bed. His &s;trength &s;eemed to have &s;u&s;tained a rapid decay; his health in a few hours was &s;o much altered for the wor&s;e, that Jeanette began to be &s;eriou&s;ly apprehen&s;ive for his life. She &s;tood by his bed&s;ide, and &s;eized his burn|ing hand; big tears trickled down her cheeks; &s;he anxiou&s;ly counted his feveri&s;h pul&s;e; her heaving bo&s;om &s;ympathized with the &s;hort, quick breath|ing of the patient; in his eyes the fever glowed, in hers the tears &s;parkled.</P>
<P>Her grateful heart was cruelly torn. Without knowing well what &s;he did, &s;he &s;uddenly pre&s;&s;ed her lips to his burning hand. He made an attempt to prevent her. "What do you mean?" &s;aid he in a low voice. "Do not embitter my la&s;t mo|ments."</P>
<P>"My benefactor!" cried Jeanette with extreme emotion. "No! you &s;hall not die! I &s;hould be the mo&s;t ungrateful wretch in nature if I could
<PB N="135" REF="035693_0133_100648F24FAC6BB0">
endure this &s;ight."&mdash;She kneeled by his bed&s;ide.&mdash; "My benefactor!" &s;aid &s;he with the utmo&s;t eager|ne&s;s, "if the thought of &s;eeing your&s;elf united to a faithful, dutiful wife can now cheer you, live &s;till&mdash;I am yours."</P>
<P>The&s;e words made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;ick man. For a long time he remained &s;ilent. At la&s;t, he tenderly pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and, not|with&s;tanding his bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> weakne&s;s, &s;aid with great animation: "My good girl! I can perceive what pa&s;&s;es in your brea&s;t. A generous feeling has extorted from you an offer which your heart di&s;|claims. The &s;ight of my &s;ufferings you con&s;ider as a reproach; you would &s;acrifice your own re|po&s;e to &s;hield your&s;elf from it. Of &s;uch a &s;tate of your feelings I ought not to avail my&s;elf, nor would I accept the offer you make, did not my own &s;en&s;a|tions now tell me&mdash;that you hazard nothing. On the contrary, I flatter my&s;elf with the hope of e&s;tab|li&s;hing the happine&s;s of your life on a more &s;olid foundation, and turning the compa&s;&s;ion you have &s;hown to your own advantage. <HI>Yes, I will die as your hu&s;band.</HI>&mdash;Ri&s;e, dear Jeanette, and, if you are &s;erious, ha&s;ten to call the par&s;on of the village. If he cannot unite our hearts, he can at lea&s;t join our hands. You &s;hall beat my name till you change it with the con&s;ent of your heart. And even then &mdash;&s;urely, dear Jeanette&mdash;you will not forget the unfortunate man who acted &s;o honorably towards you!"</P>
<P>Jeanette could not &s;peak. She retired in tears, and ordered Peter to go to the village for the par|&s;on. About noon he arrived. Jeanette was more dead than alive. The man in grey &s;eemed for a moment to gain new &s;trength. He rai&s;ed him&s;elf in bed, propped up by pillows. The bride's hand trembled! his was firm and &s;teady. The <HI>yes</HI> which &s;he pronounced was &s;carcely audible; his was manly and unembarra&s;&s;ed. The prie&s;t &s;poke the
<PB N="136" REF="035693_0134_100648F48C21ED30">
ble&s;&s;ing, the bride ru&s;hed out of the room, and lay for &s;everal hours in&s;en&s;ible on the floor of her chamber.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the &s;ick man had a long private con|ver&s;ation with the par&s;on. When Jeanette had recovered a little, and dried up her tears, &s;he re|turned as collected as po&s;&s;ible to the patient's room, and found him weaker than in the morning. With unwearied care &s;he exerted all her medical &s;kill, and exhau&s;ted all her recipes. "You have now," &s;aid &s;he, "conferred upon me an endearing intere&s;t in your life. Will you then reject the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that hand which is your own, and which &s;o anx|iou&s;ly would contribute to your relief?"</P>
<P>"Heaven forbid!" &s;aid the &s;ick man with a &s;mile: "on the marriage-day we mu&s;t refu&s;e the bride nothing. Give me, my dear wife, give me whatever you think proper; I am ready to &s;wallow every thing."</P>
<P>He kept his word, and took one &s;poonful after another; though it was ea&s;y to perceive that he did it merely from complai&s;ance, and expected no farther relief. Towards night he became vi&s;ibly weaker. Jeanette and the par&s;on &s;at by his bed&s;ide. The latter &s;poke to him con&s;olation drawn from religious views; Jeanette could only weep. Her tears the &s;ick man repaid with a grateful &s;queeze by the hand. To the par&s;on he replied, "I have ever endeavoured to act as became an hone&s;t man, and God will deal graciou&s;ly with me!"</P>
<P>At midnight his breath became &s;horter. Some|times it &s;topped altogether. In dumb angui&s;h his wife hung over his pale countenance. A cold &s;weat covered his brow&mdash;her trembling hand was going to wipe it off. Suddenly he &s;eized it with a kind of convul&s;ion, and laid it upon his eyes&mdash; his throat rattled&mdash;he uttered a groan&mdash;and expired.</P>

<P>Jeanette's grief was without bounds. Had William died in her arms &s;he could not have felt a more &s;incere &s;orrow. She lay in a paroxy&s;m of grief over the dead body. The hou&s;e rang with Peter's lamentations.</P>
<P>In vain the clergyman preached comfort. She heard not what he &s;aid, till he announced to her the la&s;t wi&s;h of the decea&s;ed, that &s;he &s;hould imme|diately leave this &s;olitude, and re&s;ide in the par&s;on's hou&s;e until the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of her grief were over, and her affairs were arranged. She was re|moved from the body almo&s;t by force; in a &s;tate of &s;peechle&s;s &s;tupefaction &s;he placed her&s;elf in the carriage, and allowed them to carry her wherever they thought proper.</P>
<P>The par&s;on committed her to the care of his wife, an hone&s;t good-hearted woman, and returned next day, in order to &s;uperintend the burial. Two or three weeks elap&s;ed before Jeanette recovered &s;pirits enough to pay any attention to what was pa&s;&s;ing around her; and during this period &s;he had never once thought of William. She now learnt how Mr. Van Shipper had &s;pent the two days of ab&s;ence in which &s;he had &s;uffered &s;o much anxiety on his account. He had been at the neighbouring town with a notary, where he formally made his la&s;t will. Jeanette was nominated heire&s;s of his

whole property, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty thou&s;and ducats, under the &s;ingle condition of providing for hone&s;t Peter till his death, in &s;uch a manner as to enable him to &s;pend his life agreeably in any way he thought be&s;t.</P>
<P>When this was announced to her, Jeanette wept bitterly. Such a di&s;intere&s;ted proof of hope|le&s;s love, at a time when &s;he did not yet bear the name of his wife, tore her heart afre&s;h. "Where is Peter?" &s;aid &s;he with emotion. Peter immedi|ately appeared, for he had been in the hou&s;e ever &s;ince his ma&s;ter's burial; and had been kept out of the way, that Jeanette's wounds might not, by &s;eeing him, be opened anew.</P>
<P>Bathed in tears, Jeanette pre&s;ented him her hand, which Peter ki&s;&s;ed with &s;obs. "We &s;hall never part, good Peter," &s;aid &s;he with faltering voice; "I will provide for you as if you were my brother."</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid the hone&s;t fellow, you are gener|ous&mdash;I know it&mdash;but my good ma&s;ter&mdash;I &s;hall never forget him!"</P>
<P>A few months Jeanette continued in the hou&s;e of the worthy par&s;on; and willingly would &s;he there have fixed her abode, but &s;he &s;aw that his hou&s;e was too &s;mall to accommodate her longer. She, therefore, was obliged to think of another a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>The war, which raged in the adjoining di&s;tricts, made re&s;idence in the country very in&s;ecure and unplea&s;ant, e&s;pecially for a woman. She re&s;olved, therefore, after &s;he had rewarded the par&s;on's kind|ne&s;s as far as it could be rewarded by a pre&s;ent, to retire into a garri&s;on town with her property. She there bought a hou&s;e, and lived reti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">though on a very re&s;pectable footing, under the name of Mrs. Van Shipper.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. THE SIEGE.</HEAD>
<P>FOR more than a year &s;he had heard no intel|ligence of William. The man in grey indeed received the Hamburgh new&s;papers, and Jeanette never failed, on the accounts of any battle, to read with great anxiety the li&s;ts of the killed and wound|ed. Fortunately &s;he never found William's name among the number; her prayers &s;eemed to have made him invulnerable. But among tho&s;e, too, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in a particular manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;he likewi&s;e &s;ought in vain for this beloved name&punc; and often &s;ecretly cur&s;ed his unlucky &s;tars, which denied him an opportunity of acquiring fre&s;h laurels.</P>
<P>Now, when a young, rich, and independent widow, it occurred to her an hundred times a day: "Where is William? Does he &s;till love me?" To the la&s;t que&s;tion her heart ever replied, Yes; but the fir&s;t nobody could &s;o readily an&s;wer, for the flames of war &s;till raged around, and the country where &s;he re&s;ided, to William was a ho&s;tile land.</P>
<P>Could &s;he but find &s;ome per&s;on to &s;end in &s;earch of him&mdash;not to renew their old long-forgotten corre&s;pondence&mdash;no, God forbid! her heart never confe&s;&s;ed &s;uch a de&s;ign!&mdash;but only to inquire whether he was alive? A &s;i&s;ter &s;urely may enquire, without impropriety, after the life of a brother.&mdash; Who can tell too in what circum&s;tances he may be placed? Whether he is not laboring under the weight of poverty?&mdash;Be&s;ides, &s;he is &s;till deep in his debt. Once did he pinch him&s;elf in the nece&s;|&s;aries

of life, to &s;ave for her the half of his pay. It was indeed but a few crowns. The heart, how|ever, does not calculate by crowns, and, in &s;hort, it was the <HI>half!</HI> Ought &s;he not now to &s;hare her property with him?&mdash;O! yes, yes! Could &s;he but find him! Had &s;he but &s;ome di&s;creet, prudent, faithful per&s;on to &s;end in &s;earch of him! Why, &s;uch a one is Peter. He is faithful and di&s;creet; but is he prudent too? Could it be &s;aid of him that he was wi&s;e as the &s;erpent and harmle&s;s as the dove? Yet what extraordinary wi&s;dom was nece&s;&s;ary to inquire for &s;uch a per&s;on, who&s;e name was &s;uch a thing; to travel as a pedlar through the country where the ho&s;tile armies lay; to inquire from regiment to regiment, for a certain officer, till he was found; and then to tell him the&s;e words: &mdash;"Your &s;i&s;ter Jeanette &s;ends you her compli|ments; &s;he lives in R***." This is the whole my&s;tery, and &s;urely Peter is &s;ufficiently qualified for the ta&s;k. To be &s;ure, he may very probably give him&s;elf a great deal of u&s;ele&s;s trouble; he will often expo&s;e the name of Mrs. Van Shipper to the je&s;ts of the young en&s;igns and lieutenants; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> where is the harm of that? Who knows Mrs. Van Shipper? Who knows her connections with William?&mdash;It is worth a trial!</P>
<P>Peter received two hundred ducats for the ex|pences of his journey, was obliged to get his le&s;&s;on by heart, and was di&s;patched with the injunction, "that he mu&s;t find out the gentleman, though he &s;hould be obliged to follow him to the extremities of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire!"</P>
<P>He had now been away two months. Jeanette counted every minute, in anxious expectation of his return. During his ab&s;ence &s;he &s;ecluded her|&s;elf from the world, and lived alone in the joyful hope of finding William alive and faithful.&mdash;Alive, that was very right&mdash;but why faithful?&mdash;Had &s;he
<PB N="141" REF="035693_0139_1006490702F5ACD8">
not renounced him? What if, during their &s;epara|tion, he had found a young, beautiful, and rich lady, with whom he had indi&s;&s;olubly united his fate? Ought not Jeanette to rejoice that he had thus for|tified the weakne&s;s of her heart, that he had &s;ecured her more firmly again&s;t the danger of a relap&s;e?&mdash; She formerly had con&s;idered her&s;elf unworthy of him&mdash;had her &s;ituation &s;ince been changed? Wealth could not re&s;tore her lo&s;t reputation.</P>
<P>No, no! By fidelity &s;he under&s;tood only the faithful affection of a brother; to this &s;he was &s;till permitted to lay claim!</P>
<P>Enough! We &s;hall not call her to a too rigorous account for the feelings by which &s;he is actuated, but boldly declare that none of my fair readers will be the fir&s;t to cen&s;ure her conduct.</P>
<P>Two months had &s;he waited in vain. The the|atre of war approached nearer and nearer, and &s;he was &s;oon obliged to renounce the hope of her me&s;|&s;enger's return, as the fortre&s;s of R*** was &s;udden|ly inve&s;ted, and immediately be&s;ieged in form. No human being was permitted either to enter or quit the place. Spies, indeed, might always contrive to make their way, but hone&s;t Peter was not formed for a &s;py.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of R*** had little de&s;ire to &s;ee their hou&s;es reduced to a&s;hes by the enemy's bombs; they pre&s;ented petition after petition to the commandant, entreating him to &s;urrender the for|tre&s;s. The gallant officer, however, knew his du|ty: and as he was wearied at la&s;t with their impor|tunities, he &s;wore to tuck up the fir&s;t man who &s;poke of &s;urrender, upon a tree, on the ram<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arts. This threat produced its effect; the citizens were obliged to be &s;ilent, and endured want and terror with &s;ecret murmurs.</P>
<P>The works of the be&s;iegers were daily brought nearer and nearer to the walls. What the be&s;ieg|ed

with great difficulty de&s;troyed in a week, was of|ten repaired, with incredible activity in the &s;pace of a night. The people began, at la&s;t, to be as much habituated to the thunder of cannon as to the ring|ing of bells upon a Sunday. The enemy, how|ever, had yet done little injury to the fortifications, nor was there any immediate danger of &s;carcity. The place was repeatedly &s;ummoned. An officer, who one day came for this purpo&s;e, with a flag of truce, to the gates, was taken to the commandant with his eyes hood-winked.</P>
<P>Jeanette lived in the &s;treet through which he was to pa&s;s; &s;he heard a noi&s;e, and went to the win|dow.&mdash;Ha! among ten thou&s;and &s;he would have known him to be William!&mdash;A white handkerchief indeed covered his eyes, and part of his no&s;e; but his mouth, his hair, his gait, his &s;ize!&mdash;She would have known him among ten thou&s;and!&mdash;She &s;creamed aloud, and &s;tretched her arms out at the window. Fortunately the noi&s;e of the crowd drowned her &s;hrieks; and as every eye was fixed on the &s;tranger, her extraordinary agitation re|mained unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>With anxious beating heart &s;he waited his re|turn, to be thoroughly convinced of the truth of her ob&s;ervation. Half an hour elap&s;ed. Jeanette walked through the room with ha&s;ty &s;teps, and a magic force irre&s;i&s;tibly attracted her to the window. At la&s;t he came.&mdash;O! yes, it was he! At an im|men&s;e di&s;tance &s;he recogni&s;ed him!&mdash;The unfeel|ing wretches led him pa&s;t.&mdash;He is &s;o near&mdash;every mu&s;cle bounds towards him.&mdash;Alas! &s;he dares not call him&mdash;&s;he cannot detain him&mdash;he di&s;appears from her &s;ight, and &s;he &s;inks in&s;en&s;ible upon the &s;ofa.</P>
<P>When &s;he recovered her &s;en&s;es, &s;he recollected to have ob&s;erved a cro&s;s hanging at his button-hole. "Noble William!" exclaimed &s;he, "gallantly ha&s;t
<PB N="143" REF="035693_0141_1006490E2CDB3720">
thou behaved, though the lying gazettes have pa&s;&s;|ed over your deeds in &s;ilence!"&mdash;This cro&s;s flatter|ed Jeanette's vanity not a little. A woman who dotes, thinks her&s;elf honored in the man &s;he loves. Her eagerne&s;s to cla&s;p her brave brother in her arms is redoubled. Her thoughts every moment wandered to the enemy's camp to William: and we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that &s;ince his appearance &s;he had been a di&s;loyal citizen; for, had it been in her pow|er, the garri&s;on would, right or wrong, have been &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>She could not conceal her joy whenever &s;he heard that a new battery began to play, that the place was more clo&s;ely inve&s;ted on all &s;ides, and that all &s;uc|cors were cut off. When the commandant found it nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent a &s;carcity, to dimini&s;h the allowance of bread, and a general murmur aro&s;e among the inhabitants, Jeanette alone remained tranquil and unconcerned, as &s;he con&s;idered it as a proof that the place would &s;peedily be given up; in expectation of which &s;he would willingly have lived upon an ounce a day. Such is the character of the be&s;t of men! The pa&s;&s;ion of love for our country excepted, every other pa&s;&s;ion renders us &s;elfi&s;h, and extingui&s;hes our feeling for the good of the whole.</P>
<P>Yet the fulfilment of her hopes was not &s;o near as &s;he had expected. In proportion as the &s;carcity increa&s;ed, the ob&s;tinate courage of the command|ant was confirmed; and to the la&s;t &s;ummons, in which he was threatened with a &s;torm, he gave the indignant an&s;wer, that he would bury him&s;elf under the ruins of the fortre&s;s. The enemy began &s;eri|ou&s;ly to make preparations for a &s;torm, and the be|&s;ieged remained day and night upon the walls, ready to oppo&s;e the mo&s;t vigorous re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>One rainy September night, the thunder of can|non awaked the citizens from their fir&s;t &s;leep. The enemy unexpectedly carried their threats into
<PB N="144" REF="035693_0142_1006490FE4E39A80">
execution, and with wild &s;houts attacked the for|tifications. The din in the &s;treets, the wailing of women, and the cries of children, the thunder of cannon, the di&s;tant &s;houts of the combatants, the bombs in the air, which gleamed a feeble light up|on the horrid &s;cene below&mdash;every thing was com|bined that could &s;hake the firme&s;t courage. But Jeanette &s;carcely retained any &s;en&s;e of her own danger, &s;he &s;aw nothing but William, be&s;meared with blood; &s;he lay on her knees, and prayed for William.</P>
<P>Several hours victory remained doubtful, till day broke, and with it the cry ro&s;e from every quarter, that the enemy were in town!&mdash;All that were able to fly took to flight. People concealed them&s;elves in churches and cloi&s;ters, in cellars and garrets. Like a ru&s;hing torrent the enemy's legions poured along the &s;treets, the doors were every where bro|ken open, every merchant's &s;hop and every con|&s;iderable hou&s;e plundered. Children were torn from their mother's brea&s;ts, and &s;tuck upon pikes; cha&s;te matrons and innocent virgins were violated in pre&s;ence of their hu&s;bands and fathers. In vain the officers endeavoured to &s;tem the fury of their troops; the bands of &s;ubordination were di&s;&s;olved, and the voice of command was lo&s;t in the dreadful confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>A troop of the&s;e wild rioters broke likewi&s;e into Jeanette's hou&s;e. She lay on her knees in prayer. The avaricious robbers fell fir&s;t upon the &s;ilver plate, and broke and plundered every thing of value. At the &s;ight of the lovely &s;upplicant, however, a new pa&s;&s;ion aro&s;e in their &s;avage brea&s;ts. They flew upon their prey with brutal violence. The poor victim maintained an unequal &s;truggle with her executioners&mdash;and alas! &s;he had been undone if her &s;creams had not brought a humane deliverer to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A young officer entered, &s;eized the
<PB N="145" REF="035693_0143_10064913E0ACF1C8">
brutal mi&s;creant by the hair, and with his drawn &s;word threatened to pierce his heart. The firm tone with which he &s;poke, and the &s;ight of the &s;word at his brea&s;t, compelled the ruffian to abandon his prey; one after another &s;tole away with the booty, and left Jeanette alone with her deliverer.</P>
<P>She awoke from the &s;woon into which &s;he had &s;unk. With timid looks &s;he eyed her deliverer, and hoped in him to recogni&s;e her William. It was not he. A young man of a noble appearance &s;tood before her, and congratulated him&s;elf on being the in&s;trument of her deliverance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. CONSTANCY REWARDED.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Jeanette had a little recovered from her terror and alarm, &s;he &s;pent the remainder of the day at the window, and reviewed the enemy's officers, who now pa&s;&s;ed in crowds. She trembled whenever &s;he &s;aw a figure which in &s;ize and air bore any re&s;emblance to her beloved brother. Often &s;he thought &s;he de&s;cried him at a di&s;tance. "That is he! that is he!" whi&s;pered her heart. He came nearer, but it was not William.</P>
<P>"O! why mu&s;t I be indebted to a &s;tranger for my deliverance? Why did not fortune and love bring him to his &s;i&s;ter's hou&s;e?&mdash;Or&mdash;Almighty God! Should he be dead!&mdash;His courage mu&s;t cer|tainly have hurried him too far!&mdash;Sure he was the fir&s;t to lead the a&s;&s;ailants!&mdash;Alas! he knew not that here his Jeanette by upon her knees imploring guardian angels for her &s;afety!"</P>
<P>Her &s;oul thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> between hope and fear. Longer than till the promi&s;ed vi&s;it of the young officer &s;he was determined not to endure this dread|ful &s;u&s;pence; and &s;he re&s;olved immediately to a&s;k intelligence of William.</P>
<P>"O! that the &s;tranger would come! Why does he tarry &s;o long? Why did I indulge this un&s;ea&s;on|able delicacy? Perhaps, now, I might have lain in William's arms!"</P>
<P>Patience, dear Jeanette! Look down the &s;treet; there comes your deliverer. You may recogni&s;e him by his elegant form, and his fine blue eye.
<PB N="147" REF="035693_0145_1006491AC0EEF7C8">
Now he &s;alutes you kindly&mdash;now he knocks at the door&mdash;the maid opens&mdash;heare&s;t thou not his foot upon the &s;tair? Why do you tremble? Have you not already prepared your&s;elf to put the que&s;tion?</P>
<P>The officer entered. Jeanette welcomed him with politene&s;s, but he allowed her no time to fini&s;h her compliment. "Madam," &s;aid he, "you were &s;o good this morning as to offer me a te&s;timony of your gratitude. However little claim my &s;mall &s;ervice may have upon you, I feel my&s;elf at pre&s;ent compelled to employ your kindne&s;s."</P>
<P>Jeanette mi&s;under&s;tood him, and &s;eized the ring which &s;he had upon her finger. The officer in|&s;tantly waved with his hand, as much as to &s;ay that &s;he was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>"No! it is not that which I come to a&s;k. I take the liberty to reque&s;t another favor, which per|haps may occa&s;ion you inconvenience. I have a friend who is dearer to me than life. He has been dangerou&s;ly wounded in &s;torming the town. In the fir&s;t moments of confu&s;ion he was carried to a hou&s;e, where he is de&s;titute of every accommoda|tion; and the number of the wounded renders it impo&s;&s;ible to tend him with &s;ufficient care. If your hou&s;e were large enough to receive him, you would not only recompence the &s;ervice I was fortunate enough to render you, but make me eternally your debtor; &s;ince every thing you can do for my friend, I &s;hall con&s;ider more than all the trea&s;ures you could heap on me!"</P>
<P>At the&s;e words the tear &s;tarted in his eye. Jea|nette was affected. She ha&s;tily replied: "And if I had but this &s;ingle apartment, I would &s;leep on the floor till your friend is out of danger. Here he &s;hall want for nothing. May I a&s;k your friend's name?"</P>
<P>"Captain Von Eichenwald."</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="035693_0146_1006491D6E5148D8">"And yours?"</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Perl&s;tadt."</P>
<P>"Lo&s;e not a moment then, Sir, to make arrange|ments for bringing your friend here. This hou&s;e and all I po&s;&s;e&s;s belong to you."</P>
<P>The officer ki&s;&s;ed her hand with gratitude, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">low down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Again &s;he felt her&s;elf a&s;hamed to inquire for William. But was this the moment for &s;uch an inquiry? The friend of a man to whom &s;he was indebted for the pre&s;ervation of her honor lay helple&s;s in the ho&s;pital, and his life, perhaps de|pended upon a &s;ingle minute. What c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> generous young man, who &s;poke of his friend with tears in his eyes, have thought of her un&s;ea&s;onable curio&s;ity? No; &s;he could not blame her&s;elf for hav|ing this time po&s;tponed the feelings of love to the &s;acred duties of gratitude. She immediately gave orders to prepare the be&s;t apartment in her hou&s;e for the reception of the expected gue&s;t, and in half an hour four grenadiers brought the wounded of|ficer down the &s;treet upon a litter.</P>
<P>Jeanette threw a compa&s;&s;ionate glance at the death-pale countenance of the young officer, who lay motionle&s;s with his eyes clo&s;ed, and &s;eemed in|&s;en&s;ible of what was pa&s;&s;ing. His friend accom|panied the litter, and watched every &s;tep of the bearers with anxiety, and warned them of every &s;tone that lay in the way.</P>
<P>"But, gracious God! what a re&s;emblance&mdash;this Captain Eichenwald and Willliam!&mdash;It is he him|&s;elf!&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;It is he!&mdash;No! no!&mdash;My God! what a cruel deception!"</P>
<P>He was now brought into the hou&s;e, where, that he might be lea&s;t di&s;turbed, he was laid in a room upon the ground floor. Jeanette was going down &s;tairs, but &s;he was not able to reach the door; her knees trembled; &s;he was obliged to &s;it down. She
<PB N="149" REF="035693_0147_10064921A2A33FA0">
was quite alone. In vain &s;he called the maid, and a boy &s;he had hired in Peter's room. Both of them had been attracted by curio&s;ity to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bby to &s;ee the wounded officer brought in.</P>
<P>Alas! what cruel anxiety &s;he &s;uffered! With what painful, impotent &s;truggles &s;he exerted all the power of her mind to animate and put in motion her agitated frame!&mdash;"What if it were William, and I cannot quit this &s;pot&mdash;am confined here&mdash; and perhaps he requires my aid&mdash;or perhaps the dreadful moment is at hand when he will no lon|ger &s;tand in need of human a&s;&s;i&s;tance!&mdash;O God! he dies, and I &s;hall never &s;ee him more!"&mdash;She made a &s;econd effort to go out, but terror had com|pletely deprived her of the u&s;e of her limbs.</P>
<P>Peace, peace, poor Jeanette? Why art thou &s;o ingenious to torture thy&s;elf? What is Captain Eichenwald to thee?&mdash;Can a &s;light re&s;emblance to William &s;o violently di&s;compo&s;e your &s;pirits, and enervate your body?&mdash;Perhaps, too, your imagina|tion deceived you. The per&s;on who thinks he &s;ees &s;pirits glide in every corner, and &s;talk abroad at night, will, in the end, really come to &s;ee &s;pectres.</P>
<P>Thus did rea&s;on whi&s;per con&s;olation to her when anxiety allowed her to exert her under&s;tanding. But rea&s;on communicated as little firmne&s;s to Jea|nette's mind as an evening zephyr could re&s;tore &s;erenity to the &s;tormy &s;ea. Anxiety and terror were vi&s;ibly painted in every feature of her coun|tenance when Lieutenant Perl&s;tadt entered the room to return her his thanks. At the fir&s;t glance he perceived that &s;he laboured under &s;ome extra|ordinary emotion. "Heavens, madam! what is the matter? You appear agitated?"</P>
<P>"And I am &s;o indeed!&mdash;Tell me, Sir&mdash;repeat to me once more your friend's name?"</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="035693_0148_100649241A5B2970">"Captain Eichenwald."</P>
<P>"Are you &s;ure?"</P>
<P>"Quite &s;ure; but how"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Now I am ea&s;y.&mdash;Forgive me, Sir&mdash;a &s;trange caprice of nature&mdash;an accidental re&s;emblance&mdash;I had a brother in your &s;ervice&mdash;his name was Mea|dows."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible! Madam&mdash;this Captain Eich|enwald&mdash;and that Meadows&mdash;but he had no &s;i&s;ter"&mdash;</P>
<P>JEANETTE (with extreme emotion)&mdash;"Proceed, Sir, for heaven's &s;ake proceed! What do you tell me?"</P>
<P>"<HI>Are the &s;ame per&s;on!</HI>"</P>
<P>He uttered the&s;e words &s;o abruptly and incon|&s;iderately, that he had not time to catch Jeanette in his arms as &s;he dropped &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground. A&s;&s;i&s;tance was called, and &s;he was laid on a bed. Perl&s;tadt, the confidante of William's heart, &s;udden|ly gue&s;&s;ed who Jeanette mu&s;t be, and bitterly re|proached him&s;elf for his want of con&s;ideration. He &s;at down be&s;ide her, held her hand in his, be&s;|prinkled her with hart&s;horn, rubbed her temples, and li&s;tened with trembling anxiety till &s;he again began to breathe.</P>
<P>At length Jeanette opened her eyes. "Does he yet live?" were her fir&s;t words.</P>
<P>"Compo&s;e your&s;elf, madam," &s;aid Frederick with friendly anxiety; "if my conjectures do not de|ceive me&mdash;if it be really Jeanette Jerome whom I &s;ee"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I am &s;he," interrupted Jeanette.</P>
<P>"Why then! every thing will go well. That name will &s;ave the life of my friend."</P>
<P>"Allow me to go to him."</P>
<P>"What is it you a&s;k? The &s;udden joy would kill him. He mu&s;t previou&s;ly be prepared."</P>
<P>"Are his wounds dangerous?"</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="035693_0149_10064928ABEAD028">"The fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ing has not yet been taken away, but the &s;urgeon gives us great hopes."</P>
<P>"Does he yet love me?"</P>
<P>"Can you a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion?"</P>
<P>"But how comes this &s;trange name?"</P>
<P>"Captain Meadows one day &s;tormed an <HI>abbatis,</HI> and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an oak wood, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eichenwald.</NOTE> from which with matchle&s;s courage, he drove an enemy three times &s;uperior in number. The con&s;equence of this achievement procured us a victory. To re|ward his gallantry, the king conferred upon him, what nature had long before be&s;towed, <HI>nobility,</HI> and called him in memory of the exploit Von Eichen|wald."</P>
<P>Jeanette would have li&s;tened for hours together to the &s;peaker, for William was the &s;ubject; but it occurred to her how indi&s;pen&s;ible Frederick was at his friend's bed-&s;ide. Abruptly &s;he drove him out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> room to inquire whether her beloved wanted any thing; whether he yet exhibited &s;ymp|toms of convale&s;cence; whether the removal had not affected him; whether he found him&s;elf com|modious in his new apartment. Scarce was he gone when &s;he called him back; for there &s;till was &s;omething which &s;he had forgot.</P>
<P>Frederick brought her the welcome intelligence that William had &s;lept well, and now &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire &s;he felt at lea&s;t to &s;ee him as he &s;lept. She pulled off her &s;hoes, and &s;tole &s;oftly to his chamber door; &s;he li&s;tened through the key|hole; joy, grief, hope, melancholy&mdash;all the&s;e feel|ings combined, drew tears from her eyes. Fre|derick was obliged to bring her away with a friend|ly violence, that her &s;obs might not di&s;turb the patient.</P>
<P>Several weeks elap&s;ed before Frederick dur&s;t venture to communicate to his friend the joyful
<PB N="152" REF="035693_0150_1006492B9CC449D0">
intelligence. He did it with the greate&s;t care and prudence, and &s;uffered him only by degrees to in|fer at la&s;t that he was under the &s;ame roof with his beloved. Yet, perhaps, the joy wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> have been too much for the invalid, if it had not been damped by the name of Van Shipper.</P>
<P>"Mrs. Van Shipper! And was it po&s;&s;ible &s;he could give her hand to another man?"&mdash;This moderated his raptures, and even made him melancholy.</P>
<P>Frederick gue&s;&s;ed what pa&s;&s;ed in his &s;oul, and bani&s;hed his gloomy, jealous apprehen&s;ions by a narrative of Jeanette's fortune. William heard every word with the mo&s;t anxious curio&s;ity. O! his fond heart received with welcome the flatter|ing con&s;olation from the lips of his friend! His beloved &s;tood ju&s;tified. Scarcely could he wait the moment when he &s;hould be permitted to pre&s;s her to his brea&s;t. He cur&s;ed the &s;urgeon, who prohibited him in the &s;tricte&s;t manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;e him&s;elf to any violent mental agitation.</P>
<P>The wi&s;hed-for hour at length arrived&mdash;the door flew open&mdash;Jeanette lay in his arms.&mdash;Their feel|ings were too powerful for utterance; feelings, which no tongue can &s;peak, no pencil de&s;cribe. In delightful raptures William &s;at on the &s;ofa. In his right hand he held his faithful mi&s;tre&s;s; in his left, the friend to whom he owed the pre&s;ervation of her honor. "I am the mo&s;t fortunate man on earth!" He could &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o more.</P>
<P>A few weeks after he heard with indifference that the king had appointed him a major. How could he now rejoice at &s;uch in event? To-mor|row was his wedding-day! And on this joyful, important day did Peter return to his mi&s;tre&s;s with di&s;con&s;olate looks, to inform her, that not|with&s;tanding all his inquiries Lieutenant Meadows was not to be found.</P>

If however, the propen&s;ity to kill rever&s;es this order; if it awakes in the &s;pring only to de&s;troy, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;oldier is at vari|ance with the cour&s;e of nature. Love alone &s;hould take the field, and the May-dew &s;hould mingle with the tears of fondne&s;s to render every grain of pow|der u&s;ele&s;s which is de&s;tined to de&s;troy the exi&s;t|ence of any being capable of the tender pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Such were the reflections which William indulg|ed when, after the lap&s;e of a happy winter, he receiv|ed the unwelcome order to hold him&s;elf in readi|ne&s;s to march, to envelope the fir&s;t genial rays of the &s;un in clouds of &s;moke, and to tread the ri&s;ing &s;eed deep in the bo&s;om of the earth. For five months he had now experienced, that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t ardent imagination conceives of the joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t-love falls infinitely &s;hort of the inexhau&s;tible felicity of dome&s;tic content; that if the imagination of the enamoured youth lends him the fiery chariot of the prophet to &s;oar into vi&s;ionary heavens, &s;ober reality brings him down to earth and to humanity, but lays him on a bed of ro&s;es. His intoxication was now gone; he enjoyed the flame, however, which formerly had been expo&s;ed to every puff of wind, and threatened at la&s;t to con&s;ume the rich fuel by which it was fed. Now, indeed, it re&s;embled the lamp which has been di&s;covered at Portici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; enclo&s;ed in the pure chry&s;tal lamp of marriage, it burnt with a mild and eternal light.</P>
<P>Large cities, in one re&s;pect, re&s;emble a retired cottage; you may live in them ju&s;t as you plea&s;e; nobody troubles him&s;elf how the happy reclu&s;e &s;pends his time. If you allow the great to enjoy their fea&s;ts, their routs, and their card-parties undi&s;|turbed,
<PB N="155" REF="035693_0153_100649351ABF9C48">
they will permit you, with a contemptuous &s;mile at your &s;ingularity, to remain happy at home. William had fully availed him&s;elf of this permi&s;&s;ion. A fond accompli&s;hed wife, a proved friend, a &s;imple yet plentiful table, a gla&s;s of good wine, and a &s;u|perfluous guinea for a brother in di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;&s;uch were his plea&s;ures; and he who requires more for the happine&s;s of life, is indeed to be pitied, were he even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the wealth for which he &s;ighs.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hes rarely abandon even the happie&s;t brea&s;t. But William belonged to that cla&s;s of the peculiar favorites of de&s;tiny, who feel no other wi&s;h but "that every thing may continue as it now is;" who wi&s;h to lo&s;e nothing of what they enjoy, and covet nothing more. The king had pre&s;ented him with a &s;mall e&s;tate in the country. "God &s;end the king peace!" would he often exclaim, "that I may retire from the army to enjoy what his bounty has be&s;tow|ed, and what love will adorn." The country round it is delightful, and the neighbourhood inhabited by old proud nobility, who would not conde&s;cend to vi&s;it new-rai&s;ed merit. What tran&s;porting pro&s;|pects! Love, friend&s;hip, a country life, and no company.</P>
<P>The ro&s;es on Jeanette's cheeks were now indeed a little faded, and the u&s;ual lu&s;tre of her eye was ob|&s;cured; but the happy hu&s;band rejoiced at the &s;ymptoms, and anxiou&s;ly longed for the pledge of faithful love. Ambition was a&s;leep in his brea&s;t. Willingly would he have taken the laurel from his brow to deck the cradle of his &s;on.</P>
<P>Never, therefore, was an order to march more unwelcome than that which William had received. Several days he concealed the di&s;agreeable intelli|gence from his wife, now become doubly dear to him. The penetrating eye of love, however, &s;oon di&s;covered his anxiety; Jeanette had long trembled at the thought of a new &s;eparation; &s;he endeavored
<PB N="156" REF="035693_0154_100649380B7063F8">
to arm her&s;elf with firmne&s;s, and &s;peak to William that comfort which &s;he her&s;elf &s;o much required. She concealed her tears, and wept only in the &s;ilence of the night when William &s;eemed to be a&s;leep at her &s;ide. If her &s;obs waked him from his &s;lumbers, &s;he imputed her agitation to an unplea&s;ant dream.</P>
<P>His tenderne&s;s would almo&s;t have induced him, at the opening of the campaign to quit the &s;ervice; but Jeanette oppo&s;ed this &s;acrifice. "It &s;hall not be &s;cornfully &s;aid of you that you lo&s;t your warlike ardor in my arms; never &s;hall it be &s;aid that you was ungrateful to your &s;overeign. Go to the field&mdash; be courageous, but not fool-hardy; remember your duty, but remember too the helple&s;s innocent whom yet you have not &s;een. When you return, he will bound to you with cries of fondne&s;s from my brea&s;t. When you have fulfilled the demands of duty, un|gird your &s;word, and let our boy play with your arms while you repo&s;e upon my bo&s;om."</P>
<P>Thus did &s;he conceal her anxiety and her grief under a feigned heroi&s;m, while the moment of &s;epa|ration was &s;till at &s;ome di&s;tance. When, however, the Sunday of the la&s;t week arrived, and William's regiment for the la&s;t time marched in proce&s;&s;ion to church, her courage di&s;appeared, and &s;he trembled like a condemned criminal as &s;he tied William's belt over his &s;houlder. He went to church&mdash;and anxiety and dovotion prompted her likewi&s;e to go thither. During the &s;ermon &s;he had frequently, unob&s;erved, wiped away the falling tear; but when the chaplain of the regiment began to offer up a &s;olemn prayer for the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms, when he ble&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embled warriors, and the tear dropped upon the whi&s;kers of the old grenadiers, &s;he hid her face in her muff, and prayed in &s;peech|le&s;s grief.</P>
<P>With what warmth did her heart repeat the words of the preaches: "Permit me, O God! to
<PB N="157" REF="035693_0155_1006493A9659E0C8">
&s;ee all tho&s;e who are now before thee, once more a&s;&s;embled in this place; let not one of them be mi&s;&s;ing; and in thy temple let us hear the triumph|ant voice of gratitude, not the complaint of the widow, and the wailing of the orphan!"</P>
<P>She returned home quite exhau&s;ted. Her cou|rage had fled. In two days the regiment was to march. Every hour &s;he heard the dreadful note of preparation under her window. Baggage and &s;tores were continually pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treets, and the dull &s;ound of the cannon rattled along. Every thing was alive; every thing was in motion, while &s;he lay weeping before a trunk packing up her hu&s;|band's linen. She had prepared bandages and lint in ca&s;e he &s;hould be wounded, and twenty times in|formed his &s;ervant where he would find every thing the moment it was wanted.</P>
<P>After this melancholy ta&s;k was performed, &s;he wandered di&s;con&s;olate from room to room, and fix|ed her &s;orrowful eyes on the empty &s;pot where Wil|liam's camp bed had &s;tood, now on the bare wall where William's pi&s;tols were u&s;ed to hang. When the morning of &s;eparation arrived, and William had &s;tolen early from her &s;ide to drown in bu&s;tle and activity the agony of &s;eparation, &s;he threw her|&s;elf into a carriage, and drove on for half a mile to a cottage, where &s;he was to bid her hu&s;band fare|well.</P>
<P>A thick cloud of du&s;t announced the approach of the troops. One regiment after another marched pa&s;t. Women and children pre&s;&s;ed with cries of &s;orrow between the ranks; here a weeping grena|dier led a little girl by the hand, while the pregnant mother walked &s;obbing be&s;ide them; here a lu&s;ty boy carried his father's mu&s;ket; here a rough, blunt &s;oldier &s;hook his aged mother's hand; there another embraced his wife, who clung in tears round his neck. Young fellows, who had no at|tachments,
<PB N="158" REF="035693_0156_1006493F5B35CA30">
laughed and made merry, waving their hats adorned with green leaves. Here and there pedlars and huck&s;ters offered their wares to &s;ell. Many drank to drown care, and tears trickled into the gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Jeanette &s;aw nothing that pa&s;&s;ed. Her heart beat, her breath was irregular, her eyes were inflamed. She gazed with fixed attention towards the gate from which the troops &s;till continued to pour. The well-known uniform of William's regiment now glanced in her view. William rode carele&s;sly on at the head of his battalion. The once fiery &s;teed paced along with &s;ober &s;teps. The reins had un|perceived dropped upon the hor&s;e's neck. When William reached the cottage, he leaped from his hor&s;e, and Jeanette from the carriage. He flew to her pale as death, and &s;he &s;unk down in his arms. He kneeled by her &s;ide, pre&s;&s;ed his cold lips to hers, which glowed with feveri&s;h heat, left the marks of his tears on her cheek, &s;prung ha&s;tily up, and mounted his &s;teed. Jeanette lay in&s;en&s;ible. When &s;he recovered, the di&s;tant drum &s;ounded in her ear. She ro&s;e, looked down the valley, and &s;aw the la&s;t clouds of du&s;t driving in the wind.</P>
<P>She quitted her attendants, retired into a neigh|bouring thicket, fell upon her knees, and prayed. Spare, ye &s;ceptres! &s;pare the &s;orrowful heart this comfort in affliction! which, if it does not heal the wound, protects it again&s;t the violence of external a&s;&s;aults. Happy the mortal who is confident in prayer! Tranquillity and hope are the rewards of his pious conviction. Early in the morning when &s;he awoke, late in the evening when &s;he retired to re&s;t, Jeanette revived her&s;elf with this cordial bal|&s;am. It &s;trengthened her in the heavy hour of her delivery, and bani&s;hed every melancholy pre&s;age concerning her hu&s;band's fate.</P>
<P>Alas! his regiment was but too &s;oon engaged in

a &s;evere action between the advanced po&s;ts. Wil|liam fought by the &s;ide of his friend, and was &s;ur|rounded. He &s;aw his gallant comrades fall around him, and, overpowered by numbers, was at la&s;t obliged to yield. He and Frederick were taken pri|&s;oners. After being plundered by the enemy's hu&s;&s;ars, they were conducted to the camp. There, indeed, they were treated with re&s;pect, but clo&s;ely watched; and in a few days they were &s;ent off, with a number of other pri&s;oners, into the interio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of France.</P>

<P>WANT and &s;orrow accompanied William in his captivity. One con&s;olation only was left him. He was not &s;eparated from his friend, who&s;e ear and heart were ever open to his &s;ighs, and who li&s;tened to the eternal monotony of his complaints with unwearied attention. Often had Frederick formerly laughed at him, as an enamour|ed enthu&s;ia&s;t, and tea&s;ed him with his raillery, tell|ing him that marriage was fain to keep it&s;elf warm by the embe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which the flame of love left behind, and that eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e it would often extingui&s;h when they began to glow. Now, however, he acknow|ledged that Love did not always extingui&s;h his torch when Hymen lighted his, &s;ince never had William doted on his wife with &s;uch fond affection. The flame of fir&s;t de&s;ire, which the &s;oft gales&punc; of undi&s;|turbed
<PB N="160" REF="035693_0158_1006729677B34700">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion blow invi&s;ibly from heart to heart, was now awakened by the regret of &s;eparation. He thought only of Jeanette. He &s;poke only of her; no privations affected him, no object could engage his curio&s;ity. Plundered and &s;tript of the mo&s;t ur|gent nece&s;&s;aries, he leapt for joy when in a corner of his pocket he found a &s;mall ink-horn and a &s;ilver pen, which had e&s;caped the avarice of the hu&s;&s;ars. He now daily wrote a letter, at every place where the e&s;cort &s;topped, when he could find even a &s;tone by the road-&s;ide to &s;erve as a table. When others ate or &s;lept, his heart was awake. Grief, the pain of &s;eparation, the fonde&s;t con&s;olation, the mo&s;t glowing hopes of meeting, he painted in his letters with ihe mo&s;t ardent enthu&s;ia&s;m; and with what grateful rapture did he pre&s;s to his brea&s;t the good-natured corporal, who promi&s;ed to forward his fir&s;t letter!</P>
<P>After a long and fatiguing journey, they at la&s;t arrived at the place of their de&s;tination, a little town in Guienne. Here they received permi&s;&s;ion to go about at large on their parole of honor. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur&s;t not avail them&s;elves much of this indulgence, as the deluded people hated every foreigner, as the &s;lave of de&s;poti&s;m, and thought them&s;elves ju&s;tified, with &s;avage ferocity to &s;eize the &s;lighte&s;t pretext to in&s;ult or even to murder men whom they con&s;id|ered as tools hired for their &s;ubjugation.</P>
<P>During the day, therefore, William and Frederick &s;eldom left their &s;orry habitation. Commonly they &s;tole out in the twilight, &s;trolled through the bloom|ing fields, &s;tretched them&s;elves on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anks of the Garonne, or at night &s;ought the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> hut of &s;ome pea&s;ant, who entertained them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h milk, ho|ney, and fruit.</P>
<P>One evening they accidentally met with a Ger|man book; and as they had &s;o long been deprived of the plea&s;ure of reading, they congratulated them|&s;elves
<PB N="161" REF="035693_0159_1006729806DEC618">
on the fea&s;t that awaited them next morning. The fir&s;t rays of the &s;un found the two friends already in the fields. The unclouded &s;ky and the dewy gra&s;s &s;eemed to threaten a warm day, and they &s;ought, therefore, at a little di&s;tance from the town, a &s;ha|dy thicket which lay on the brow of a hill. There they found a delightful retired &s;pot, and &s;tretched them&s;elves under an olive-tree. William pulled the book out of his pocket, and Frederick lay care|le&s;sly on the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>They had not been here above two hours when a wild din from the neighbouring village &s;truck their ears. They were alarmed, and he&s;itated whether they &s;hould leave their retreat, or conceal them|&s;elves deeper in the wood. The la&s;t might appear &s;u&s;picious; they remained, therefore, where they were, re&s;olved to return to the town as &s;oon as the road &s;hould be clear, for it pa&s;&s;ed directly by the village church, from the &s;teeple of which proceed|ed the alarm which had rou&s;ed their apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>As they li&s;tened, and lo&s;t them&s;elves in conjec|tures re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of the tumult, they &s;ud|denly heard a ru&s;tling in the thicket at a little di&s;|tance. It &s;eemed as if a flying roe ru&s;hed pa&s;t them. It came nearer&mdash;again it &s;eemed to recede &mdash;&s;ometimes on the right, &s;ometimes on the left&mdash; the irregular breathing of a per&s;on exhau&s;ted with running appri&s;ed them that &s;ome one was at hand. The two friends held in their breath, and anxiou&s;ly looked towards the place from which the &s;ound &s;eemed nearer and nearer to approach.</P>
<P>"Here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are!" exclaimed ha&s;tily and in a feeble voice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rown girl, with flowing hair and di&s;ordered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, while with eager anxiety, and oc|ca&s;ionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g behind, &s;he broke upon the a&s;to|ni&s;hed &s;tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs.</P>

<P>"<HI>How? Why? What is the matter?</HI>"</P>
<P>The girl was exhau&s;ted and could not an&s;wer, &s;he only pointed with her finger to the footpath; and then the &s;trangers &s;till he&s;itated, &s;he ran be|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re them&punc; pointed and folded her hands in the attitude of entreaty. William and Frederick at la&s;t f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owed her, without knowing why or whither. Their &s;wift conductor &s;oon brought them to a fi&s;herman's empty hut. Here &s;he &s;ank down on the gra&s;s, and exclaimed: "I can do no more!"</P>
<P>Her full bo&s;om heaved with violent agitation; the blood for&s;ook her cheeks. Yet now and then &s;he &s;truggled to hold in her breath, turned towards the village to li&s;ten, and again panted more violent|ly. The two friends &s;tood before her, and knew not what to think of this extraordinary incident. They gave her time to recover her&s;elf. Frederick lighted upon a wooden di&s;h in the hut, which he filled with water and gave her. She drank a few drops, and bathed her cheeks, to cool the glowing heat. When at la&s;t &s;he recovered the u&s;e of her tongue, &s;he told them in broken incoherent &s;en|tences:</P>
<P>"Some ill-inclined per&s;ons have la&s;t night cut down the tree of liberty in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llage. The whole village is in an uproar.

<P>"If you follow this footpath, it will carry you into the road to Montauban; then leave our village on your left hand, and after making a circuit of a few miles you may in the twilight return to town."</P>
<P>"But we are innocent," &s;aid William.</P>
<P>"We have never even &s;een your tree of liberty," pur&s;ued Frederick.</P>
<P>"That will avail you nothing," returned the girl ha&s;tily. "You will be murdered&mdash;you are &s;trangers&mdash;you are not French citizens (this &s;he &s;aid with &s;ome degree of &s;olemnity.)

<P>William and Frederick &s;oon perceived that in &s;pite of their innocence, their lives were in danger, and that they had not a moment to lo&s;e. They thanked their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">erous deliverer, and flew down the pathway which &s;he had pointed out.

<P>AS they had now left the dreadful village a good way behind, the fugatives con&s;idered them&s;elves &s;afe, re&s;ted a few minutes, and then &s;lowly pur&s;ued their way, ble&s;&s;ing the generous girl who, notwith&s;tanding her pride in the title of a French citizen, had &s;o kindly appri&s;ed them of their danger. They &s;oon perceived, however, that the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit, like a raging lione&s;s, had thrown the whole country round into alarm and apprehen&s;ion by its wild roar. They found, that in our times the cutting down of a tree of liberty can excite the &s;ame fury, which two hundred years ago the de&s;truction of a cro&s;s, or two thou&s;and years ago the violation of a &s;acred oak, would have occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>When Alcibiades demoli&s;hed the &s;tatue of Mer|cury, the Athenians raged ju&s;t like the new men of France about their tree of Liberty. On the right and on the left, before and behind the fugitives, the &s;ullen &s;ound of bells was heard in all the villages. They redoubled their &s;peed. The road led to a hill, which they endeavoured to reach; but, alas! under the brow of the hill lay a village, from which
<PB N="165" REF="035693_0163_100672A20763DC68">
the confu&s;ed noi&s;e of &s;houts and the rattling of arms proceeded. Ha&s;tily they wheeled round, ran rapidly down the hill, directly back again, and per|ceived, at a di&s;tance, a cloud of du&s;t, which warn-them that their pur&s;uers were at hand.</P>
<P>They now flew over hedges and ditches acro&s;s the fields; &s;ometimes they thought of concealing them&s;elves in the &s;tanding corn; &s;ometimes they thought of hiding them&s;elves in a farmer's hay|loft; but a loud-mouthed cur or a bawling infant frightened them away. They now knew not whither they went, ran through brooks and mora&s;&s;es, with|out reflection. They heard the alarm all around, and at la&s;t they arrived, without &s;u&s;pecting it, at the road they had left.</P>
<P>The danger every moment increa&s;ed. The fields round were covered with their pur&s;uers; before and behind, clouds of du&s;t rolled; the bells rang from every &s;teeple, and the &s;houts of men and the barking of dogs broke on them from every quarter.</P>
<P>"I can go no farther!" &s;aid William. "Heaven protect my wife and child! Here will I die!"</P>
<P>He &s;unk down under a tree. Frederick &s;um|moned up all his &s;trength, climbed the tree, and viewed the country around.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee a country hou&s;e," &s;aid he, "not two thou&s;and paces di&s;tant. Belong to whom it may, the owner will &s;urely protect us at lea&s;t from the fury of the mob. If he is a man of honor, he will deliver us into the hands of the civil power, but not permit us&mdash;even &s;hould he con&s;ider us guilty&mdash; to be murdered like wild bea&s;ts by a frantic rab|ble."</P>
<P>He came down. William ro&s;e, and they exert|ed every effort to gain the country-hou&s;e. In a romantic valley, through which a branch of the Garonne rolled meandering, lay a &s;olitary habitation, &s;haded by lofty elms, on the north &s;ide bounded
<PB N="166" REF="035693_0164_100672A3992FC8D0">
by a thick grove, which &s;tretched down to the banks of the river. The fugitives arrived, with|out interruption, at the iron gate that bounded the front lawn, which was ta&s;tefully ornamented with flower-beds. They &s;ound the doors &s;hut and barred. William boldly took a &s;tone, and knocked loud at the iron wicket. The grove re|echoed the &s;ound, but no dog barked, no living creature &s;tirred. They called. Nobody an&s;wered. The hou&s;e appeared to be empty. A number of broken windows confirmed the &s;uppo&s;ition. The railing was too high for them to climb over, and too &s;trong for them to break. The moments were precious. William and Frederick ha&s;tened to the other &s;ide of the grove, there to look for a place where they might wait the &s;hades of night.</P>
<P>The grove was likewi&s;e &s;urrounded by a pretty high wall, but time had here and there loo&s;ened the &s;tones; and fear lent them wings, for the voices of their pur&s;uer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> already re&s;ounded through the valley. A gloomy thicket of tall pines received them in its &s;hade. Here they li&s;tened a few mo|ments; and as the whole grove &s;eemed to be inha|bited by the feathered creation, as the linnets and bullfinches hopped as fearle&s;sly about them as if they had never &s;een a human form, they ventured to penetrate deeper into its rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>They &s;oon perceived that a little walk, in the &s;tile of the Engli&s;h gardens, &s;kirted round the whole of the grove; but the gra&s;s that grew thick through the gravel, which was here and there broken up by the rain, and not repaired, &s;eemed to prove that it was long &s;ince it had been trod by human foot. Courageou&s;ly the two friends advanced, intending, if po&s;&s;ible, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome empty corner of the hou&s;e; when Frederick &s;uddenly &s;topped, as William pulled him by the coat and pointed, with a mixture of fear and &s;urpri&s;e, to the mark of a lady's foot in a mole-hill.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="035693_0165_100672A78A9EDB58">It was now plain that this mu&s;t have happened ye&s;terday or the day before, con&s;equently the hou&s;e with the broken windows was not altogether un|inhabited, and the fugitives remained irre&s;olute in new embarra&s;&s;ment and apprehen&s;ion. In &s;pite of their dangerous &s;ituation (for the voice of their pur&s;uers &s;till &s;ounded more terrible in the valley) their feelings, on perceiving the prints of the foot were very different from tho&s;e which Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe had experienced on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion. They could not cea&s;e to contemplate with plea&s;ure the mark, which was that of an elegant foot; and William thought, that if it was po&s;&s;ible that Jea|nette could be here, it mu&s;t have been made by hers. For a moment fear gave place to &s;ofter emotions. So feels the traveller, who, &s;urrounded by the murky &s;hades of night, &s;uddenly de&s;cries at a di&s;tance a friendly light.</P>
<P>What a powerful effect does an inch more or le&s;s produce upon the &s;en&s;es of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en, through them on the imagination, and &s;o on upon the under&s;tand|ing! Had the mark covered the whole of the mole|hill, the idea of beauty, and with it of harmle&s;s goodne&s;s, would not have a&s;&s;ociated with the feel|ings of our fugitives. Perhaps, alarmed at the appearance, they might have again made their re|treat over the walls. A creature, however, that had &s;uch elegant feet, &s;eemed &s;o little calculated to in&s;pire terror, that they were inclined to wi&s;h rather than to avoid a meeting.</P>
<P>With more caution and circum&s;pection they now pur&s;ued the winding way, which appeared to lead to the banks of the river. The murmuring of the &s;tream &s;oon convinced them that they were right; and after de&s;cending the footpath, winding through a thick &s;hrubbery, down a gentle declivity, they commanded a pro&s;pect of the water. They ob&s;erv|ed a little i&s;land, on which was built, with &s;ingular
<PB N="168" REF="035693_0166_100672A90CB66CD0">
art and ta&s;te, a grotto, &s;urrounded with weeping willows, which bended their branches to the &s;tream. A little draw-bridge led to the i&s;land. This &s;ecret rece&s;s appeared a &s;ecure a&s;ylum, and they redoubled their &s;teps to reach the bridge. Silently they pa&s;&s;ed over, and drew it up behind them. Silently, and with &s;ome anxiety, they approached the avenue to the grotto. Frederick was a few &s;teps before, as William was detained fixing the bridge. When William had fini&s;hed, and was running up to over|take him, he &s;aw his friend &s;uddenly turn round, his face pale and his knees trembling. He laid his finger on his mouth, waved his hand, and by his ge&s;tures &s;ignified that William &s;hould approach without noi&s;e.</P>
<P>William obeyed, and threw a fearful glance to|wards the grotto, which was lighted by a window in the roof. Two coffins lay clo&s;e together, covered with black, and without any ornament. Upon one of the coffins lay a female figure, in profound grief, her back towards them, and her head leaning upon her hand. She &s;eemed to be a&s;leep, or to be lo&s;t in grief&mdash;they did not hear her breathe.</P>
<P>Dreadfully &s;hocked at this &s;pectacle, the two friends &s;tood motionle&s;s, and conver&s;ed only by doubtful looks. They waited long to &s;ee whether this &s;olemn figure would turn round. As not the lea&s;t movement betrayed the appearance of life, and they &s;aw a beetle crawling on her white neck, without attracting her attention, Frederick began to think that &s;he mu&s;t be in a &s;woon, and ventured to ad|vance a few &s;teps nearer. His foot trod upon &s;ome dry leaves: they ru&s;tled&mdash;the figure ro&s;e up. Hea|vens! what a creature! with every quality of an angel but fearle&s;&s;ne&s;s!</P>
<P>Fair as a lily, with long flowing black hair, an eye mild as the evening &s;tar &s;urrounded with light clouds, her bo&s;om negligently covered, who&s;e dazz|ling

whitene&s;s was heightened by the contra&s;t of her black robe, a tall elegant form, a hand which &s;eemed formed to wipe away the tears of love, a foot which the fugitives ea&s;ily recogni&s;ed to be that which had left the mark in the grove&mdash;Such did the lovely &s;tranger &s;tand before them, in the fir&s;t bloom of her charms. Had not her full bo&s;om anxiou&s;ly heaved&mdash;had not her white hand trembled, they would have dropped on their knees before her, as a &s;uperior being. Frederick &s;tood &s;peechle&s;s, with his eyes riveted to this cele&s;tial figure. Wil|liam endeavored to &s;peak, but it was only in broken &s;entences. The &s;tranger fir&s;t broke &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"Who are you?&mdash;What do you want?&mdash;Why have you intruded upon this &s;anctuary of my grief? Would you rob me even of the&s;e dear remains?"</P>
<P>At the&s;e words &s;he ha&s;tily threw the lid from one of the coffins, and di&s;covered the corp&s;e of an old man, who&s;e head was &s;evered from his body. This &s;hocking &s;pectacle occa&s;ioned a long pau&s;e, during which the young lady gazed at the corp&s;e with fold|ed hands, and &s;hed a tender tear. Frederick was unable to &s;peak, nor did he attempt to reply. Wil|liam collected him&s;elf as well as he could, and in &s;oothing accents began to relate the accident which had brought them here. He begged for an a&s;ylum for a few hours, till they could elude their pur&s;uers. The uproar which every moment grew louder and louder, te&s;tified the truth of his &s;tory.</P>
<P>As William &s;poke, the young lady's attention was involuntarily fixed by his figure and di&s;cour&s;e. When he had fini&s;hed, her looks fluctuated doubt|fully between him and his companion. She had not made any an&s;wer, when a wild mob was heard thundering at the iron gate, and another round the walls of the grove.</P>
<P>"What can I do to a&s;&s;i&s;t you?" &s;aid &s;he: "Where can I conceal you?&mdash;Every corner of the

grove is well known to the&s;e mon&s;ters. From its mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es they dragged my aged father, and cruelly murdered him!" She bur&s;t into tears, and &s;eemed anew to be quite engro&s;&s;ed with her grief, till a noi&s;e at the gate louder than before, an|nounced that the mob had bur&s;t it open.</P>
<P>"They come!" &s;aid William. Frederick did not &s;eem to hear them. "They come!" repeated the lady with anxiety. "It is too late to take you to the de&s;olate man&s;ion&mdash;there you would be&mdash;but no&mdash;it is too late. Fly! fly! I cannot &s;ee you murdered!"</P>
<P>The frantic rabble now ru&s;hed through the gar|den in crowds. Nothing remained for the fugitives but to plunge in the river; but it was deep, and neither of them could &s;wim. "Ha!" exclaimed William, "for what an inglorious death has fate re|&s;erved me!"&mdash;Frederick &s;aid nothing. He gazed at the young lady, and &s;eemed to be utterly in&s;en|&s;ible.</P>
<P>The young mourner walked up and down, wring|ing her hands. She looked compa&s;&s;ionately at the &s;trangers, and appeared to &s;truggle with a thought which &s;he &s;ometimes reluctantly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and again benevolently cheri&s;hed. William &s;aw what pa&s;&s;ed in her &s;oul. He threw him&s;elf at her feet: "If this angel form can give the lea&s;t pledge of huma|nity, &s;ave an unfortunate being, who has left in his own land, other helple&s;s creatures dependent on him!"</P>
<P>"Humanity!" repeated the lady, "Alas! that was denied to me!"</P>
<P>Suddenly the whole grove re&s;ounded with the voices of men, and on all &s;ides the &s;houts of frenzy were heard. It ru&s;hed like a whirlwind througn the trees, and the frightened birds for&s;ook their ne&s;ts. The mob had already di&s;covered the path which led to the grotto; numbers had reached the
<PB N="171" REF="035693_0169_100672AF31672010">
bridge, and began to cut down with their &s;cythes the pulleys by which it was drawn up. A glow over&s;pread the young lady's cheeks; the mild lu&s;|tre of her eye kindled into fire. She threw her&s;elf on the coffin. Anxiety lent her &s;trength; &s;he lifted out the dead body and laid it on the mo&s;&s;y bank.</P>
<P>"Stranger! conceal your&s;elf here," &s;aid &s;he, pointing to the coffin. William &s;prang into it, and in a moment the lid was replaced. She now open|ed the &s;econd coffin. It was empty. She made a &s;ign to Frederick, which &s;he was thrice obliged to repeat before he under&s;tood. At la&s;t he threw him|&s;elf into the coffin, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with an air which &s;eemed to &s;how that he only obeyed her commands. She &s;hut the lid upon him, and at this moment the &s;teps of their pur&s;uers thundered over the bridge.</P>
<P>The young lady threw her&s;elf down between the two coffins, with an arm extended over each, and in this po&s;ture &s;he awaited the arrival of the mob.&mdash; They came.&mdash;Men armed with &s;cythes, &s;ickles, &s;words and mu&s;kets, &s;urrounded the entry into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rotto; but &s;uddenly the foremo&s;t &s;tood &s;till, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">under&s;truck, and kept back tho&s;e behind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith gaping mouths, gazed over their &s;hould|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</P>
<P>&punc;What do you want!" &s;aid the lady to them with firm voice. "Is it not enough that you have murdered my father?

<P>The pea&s;ants looked at one another doubtfully. The contra&s;t between the beauty of the lady and the bloody corp&s;e, together with their di&s;appointed ex|pectations, made a powerful impre&s;&s;ion on the rough &s;ons of nature. The wild clamor was &s;ucceeded
<PB N="172" REF="035693_0170_100672B1F1FC0158">
by a death-like &s;ilence. "Come, friends!" at la&s;t &s;aid one of them, "they are not here!"</P>
<P>"You may be perfectly ea&s;y, mi&s;s," &s;aid ano|ther, "tell us only where the villains have fled."</P>
<P>"Whom do you mean?" pur&s;ued the lady. "Since that old man fell under your weapons, no human foot has entered this &s;olitude. If you mean to in&s;ult&mdash;if you mean to delight your&s;elves with the &s;ight of a murdered man, come nearer! See how placidly he &s;miles; he has forgiven his mur|derers. Come in, and touch tho&s;e cold hands, of who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing you have deprived me!"</P>
<P>At the&s;e words &s;he &s;eized the hand of the corp&s;e, and held it out to them. The pea&s;ants were &s;hock|ed, and &s;tarted back. The hindermo&s;t di&s;appeared; the crowd di&s;per&s;ed, and the la&s;t went away with fearful looks. "They are not here!" cried they as they cro&s;&s;ed the bridge. "They are not here!" they &s;ounded through the grove. The noi&s;e grad|ually &s;ub&s;ided, and before a quarter of an hour elap&s;ed, the birds had again taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ne&s;ts, and a gloomy &s;ilence of the &s;olitude.</P>

<P>BABET&mdash;for it is now time to di&s;cover the name of this lovely guardian angel&mdash;Babet was the daugh|ter of a nobleman, who had the misfortune to be rich, and to be a man of worth and honor. Of cour&s;e he was obnoxious to the party now in power. They re&s;olved to get rid of him in the u&s;ual man|ner; that is to &s;ay, they denounced him as an ari&s;|tocrat; he became a marked man; and the people, ever ready for &s;uch deeds, undertook the execution of the &s;entence. Two of his &s;ons were murdered. The third fled, as was &s;aid, to America, there to weep in company with young La Fayette.</P>
<P>The old man him&s;elf cho&s;e the mo&s;t retired of all his e&s;tates, and thought to e&s;cape per&s;ecution by a voluntary &s;eclu&s;ion. In vain, however!&mdash;Party fury traced him to this harmle&s;s retreat, tore him from the arms of his only daughter, and hurried him to the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>Babet, in the &s;ixteenth year of her age, had been educated in a cloi&s;ter; and when the de&s;troying angel, called <HI>Liberty,</HI> bur&s;t tho&s;e holy cells, &s;he returned to the bo&s;om of her family. While &s;he lived im|mured within the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls of the cloi&s;ter, except the old blind gardener, &s;he had never &s;een the face of man; and, except a favorite cat, had never loved any thing. When &s;he became acquainted with her worthy father, and her &s;prightly brothers, &s;he loved them with her whole &s;oul, and their &s;entiments and modes of thinking became hers; for women rarely choo&s;e their own opinions, they are formed by the company in which they live. They commonly love with great con&s;tancy; but if they ever change their attachments, they likewi&s;e change their prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Babet was a decided royali&s;t. The death of her
<PB N="174" REF="035693_0172_100672B4F6E7AA00">
father and brothers at fir&s;t made her quite delirious&punc; and &s;till nouri&s;hed by the &s;olitude in which &s;he lived, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eadful objects to which &s;he was habituated, her grief bordered upon lunacy. She conver&s;ed only with the corp&s;e of her father, &s;he &s;lept on the mo&s;s bank in the grotto, ate only the fruits which the trees a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cidentally pre&s;ented; never went beyond the limits of the gloomy grove, was de&s;erted by the officious &s;ervants of her former pro&s;perity, and even di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the few who offered to &s;hare her danger and her poverty.</P>
<P>Her inflamed imagination had in&s;pired her with a &s;uper&s;titious idea, which &s;he neither could nor wi&s;hed to drive from her mind. Having dream|ed that on the anniver&s;ary of her father's birth|day, which was to happen in a few weeks, &s;he would be united to her father and brothers by a &s;troke of lightning, &s;he was firmly convinced that the dream would be reali&s;ed; for which rea&s;on &s;he had prepared an empty coffin to receive her. This firm belief rendered her indifferent to what pa&s;&s;ed around her. She &s;miled when any attempt was made to amu&s;e her, and wi&s;tfully &s;hook her head when &s;he was advi&s;ed to collect the remains of her e&s;tates in different provinces, which were left a prey to rapine.</P>
<P>In this temper of mind the two friends found her; and on &s;eeing them, nature, for the fir&s;t time, re&s;umed her rights, and bound her to life with new and tender ties. A young lady, who, till now, &s;eemed to be abandoned by God and the world, who had no relation, no friend to whom &s;he could fly; a young, helple&s;s, in&s;ulated creature, could not but feel her&s;elf in a new element when &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf the deliverer of two hand&s;ome, gene|rous young men. When Babet opened the cof|fin, &s;he felt &s;omething as if &s;he &s;aw her brother ri&s;e from it. She was no longer without &s;upport. She
<PB N="175" REF="035693_0173_100672B8E545FA18">
had purcha&s;ed at the ri&s;k of her life, perhaps of her honor, two grateful protectors.</P>
<P>The young men lay at her feet, pre&s;&s;ed their glowing lips to her hand, and uttered &s;oothing words of gratitude. A new and delightful feeling diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through that brea&s;t, which, till now, had heaved only with &s;ighs. She looked down upon the creatures with complacency; &s;he wi&s;hed to complete the work of their deliverance; &s;he for|got her father's corp&s;e, and &s;he even forgot to re|proach her&s;elf for her negligence.</P>
<P>"Follow me!" &s;aid &s;he. "Your per&s;ecutors and mine might repent their having been &s;urpri&s;ed and overcome by a feeling of humanity; they might &s;uddenly return. Follow me into the man&s;ion, which they have di&s;mantled. I will conduct you to a cavern, which, for many weeks, &s;erved my fa|ther as a &s;ecure retreat. Alas! he would have liv|ed &s;till had he not left it!"</P>
<P>Babet went out of the grotto. Frederick and William followed her; the former like a per&s;on intoxicated; the latter had recovered the perfect ex|erci&s;e of his faculties With politene&s;s and ten|der concern he conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with their fair guide as &s;he ha&s;tily walked on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fore them, and he contri|ved to introduce &s;o many refined and elegant com|pliments on her beauty and beneficence, that Ba|bet by degrees, was brought down from her con|ver&s;e with &s;pirits to an intercour&s;e with kindred mortals. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much con&s;ideration, as to avoid every open and expo&s;ed place of the garden, and to &s;teal along between high hedges till &s;he brought her gue&s;ts &s;afe through many a winding alley to the back-door of the de&s;olate habitation.</P>
<P>Here they mounted a winding &s;tair-ca&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;mall antichamber, and went into the kitchen; where an old footman and a young &s;er|vant girl lay trembling on their knees, emploring

all the &s;aints in the calendar for help&punc; When the frantic mob broke into the garden, they thought that the rabble had come to de&s;troy the la&s;t frail &s;hoot of the old &s;tem, and gave up their mi&s;tre&s;s for lo&s;t. When they heard foot&s;teps on the &s;tair, they imagined that their own hour was come, and were pronouncing their la&s;t prayer. At the &s;ight of Babet their terrors were changed into the wild|e&s;t tran&s;ports. They &s;prang up, leaped and &s;ung around her, and it was a longtime before &s;he could make the footman under&s;tand that &s;he wanted the key of the &s;ubterraneous cavern. He then ran to find it, &s;ought it over the whole hou&s;e from the garret to the cellar, and at la&s;t found it in her own pocket.</P>
<P>Babet now conducted the &s;trangers into her father's clo&s;et. Here &s;he took a lighted lamp, opened a concealed door in the tape&s;try, and de|&s;cended a narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e, which, through many windings, terminated in a &s;pacious vault. She fought and found an iron crow, which accident &s;eemed to have left in a corner. She gave it to William, and de&s;ired him, as &s;he pointed out the place in the wall, to remove the &s;tones, which were but newly built up, and were but weakly fa&s;tened.</P>
<P>He did as he was de&s;ired. An iron dooor ap|peared, &s;o &s;mall that a per&s;on could hardly pu&s;h through. Babet touched a concealed &s;pring. The door flew open, and they entered a &s;pacious cavern, which was furni&s;hed only with a few nece&s;&s;ary articles of furniture, a &s;traw bed, and a mattre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Here you may remain quiet and ea&s;y till night|fall. Meanwhile I will di&s;patch a per&s;on to reconnoitre the road, and to bring intelligence. When all is &s;afe, I my&s;elf will return and liberate you from this confinement. My &s;ervant, in the mean time, &s;hall bring you bread and fruit for your refre&s;hment. Except &s;uch &s;canty fare I have nothing to offer.

The plunderers have robbed me of every thing. Meanwhile, replace the &s;tone in the wall, and &s;hut the iron door; you may then &s;leep in peace till I awake you."</P>
<P>She di&s;appeared. A few minutes after old An|tony brought a light and a ba&s;ket of fruit. The two friends were then left alone. Frederick threw him&s;elf on the &s;traw-bed, and hid his face; while William employed him&s;elf, in &s;ilence, in rebuilding the &s;tones which formed the fal&s;e wall that con|cealed the &s;ecret door.</P>

<P>Con&s;ider only how many things combined to heighten the force of Babet's charms.

He walked backwards and forwards, whi&s;tled, &s;ang, examined the furniture, and &s;urveyed the inhabitants, which con&s;i&s;ted of toads and beetles.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, having found a ru&s;ty nail, idlene&s;s &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him the amu&s;ement &s;o natural in inns and

pri&s;ons, of &s;crawling his name on the wall. For this purpo&s;e he took a view of the wall, and pitch|ed upon the large&s;t &s;quare &s;tone, which was di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by &s;ome degree of co|louring mingled with its grey hue. He took a chair to &s;tand upon, which &s;eemed to have been manufactured in the time of Henry IV. and with the lamp, now quite &s;uperfluous to his dreaming companion, in his left hand, the ru&s;ty nail in his right, he mounted up to immortalize his name in this &s;ubterraneous retreat.</P>
<P>But what was his a&s;toni&s;hment when he held up the lamp and &s;aw an in&s;cription engraved upon the &s;tone? It was clear that it had been formerly employed for the purpo&s;e he had intended, a cir|cum&s;tance which had made it whiter and more con&s;picuous than any of the re&s;t. The characters were feeble, and in &s;ome places &s;carcely legible. With con&s;iderable exertion, however, William made out the following:</P>
<P>"<HI>Deare&s;t Babet! If thy innocence at la&s;t can find no a&s;ylum but this; if you are robbed of all, you will find, under this &s;traw-bed, a proof that, even in his mo&s;t dreary hours, thy father &s;till remembered and cared for thee.</HI>"</P>
<P>William in&s;tantly communicated the di&s;covery to Frederick, but Frederick &s;eemed to treat it with indifference.&mdash;"What, don't you hear?" &s;aid William. "Ri&s;e, probably beneath that &s;traw a trea&s;ure lies concealed."</P>
<P>"What is the trea&s;ure to us?" &s;aid Frederick, and never &s;tirred.</P>
<P>"But it belongs to our guardian angel&mdash;to our generous deliverer!"</P>
<P>Scarce had William fini&s;hed this remon&s;trance, when Frederick was on his feet, carefully turning over the &s;traw. They found a place where the earth &s;eemed loo&s;e. They employed the nail to dig it up, and in a few minutes they pulled out a

ca&s;ket, which was filled with articles of value. Tran&s;ported at this accident, which enabled them to te&s;tify their gratitude to their generous ho&s;te&s;s, they expected the coming night with redoubled impatience.

<P>"How fortunate is my friend," &s;aid William, with a generous &s;acrifice of his own accidental merit&mdash;"how fortunate is my friend, that he can repay this benevolent kindne&s;s!

<P>Frederick &s;tood be&s;ide him, and pre&s;ented the ca&s;ket. Babet looked with doubtful a&s;toni&s;hment, now at her gue&s;ts, now at the well-known ca&s;ket, the appearance of which in the hands of &s;trangers, as well as the mention of her name, &s;eemed equally unaccountable.

<P>Scarcely had the tender girl recogni&s;ed the tra|ces of that honored hand, no &s;ooner had &s;he heard the words "deare&s;t Babet," than &s;he dropped upon her knees, bur&s;t into tears, and rai&s;ed her hands to the &s;acred &s;tone. She received the ca&s;ket as a re|lick, and pre&s;&s;ed it with re&s;pect to her lips. "Honored father," cried &s;he, "thou knowe&s;t that I no longer &s;tand in need of this provi&s;ion"!</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow turned round to the two friends: "You have made &s;trong profe&s;&s;ions of your gratitude. If indeed I have any claim to your thanks, it is in your power to di&s;charge the obligation."</P>
<P>"Speak!" &s;aid William, while his friend's eyes &s;parkled with eagerne&s;s; and it was ea&s;y to read in them that he hoped it would at lea&s;t demand the hazard of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="035693_0181_100672CA68CC4660">"You will &s;oon return to your native country," continued Babet, "and there it is my reque&s;t that you would endeavour to obtain intelligence of the Chevalier Belloy. He fled to America&mdash;perhaps he is &s;till alive!"&mdash;She &s;aid this with &s;uch warmth of feeling, her eye &s;eemed to glance to heaven &s;o ardent a prayer for the life of the Chevalier, that Frederick was greatly agitated. But he was &s;oon relieved from his anxiety when the lovely creature proceeded: "He is my brother&mdash;now my only brother!&mdash;To him belongs the&s;e jewels; they may enable him perhaps again to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;plen|dor of his hou&s;e&mdash;for him I commit them to your care.

<P>She held out her hand to them at once, to re|ceive their oaths. William pre&s;&s;ed it with firm|ne&s;s, but his friend was deprived of his con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s when her fingers touched him. He trembled and he&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted Had Babet been vain or &s;u&s;picious, &s;he would have known him to be a lover, or &s;u&s;|pected him to be a knave.&mdash;She continued with compo&s;ure:</P>
<P>"If all your pains and inquiries are in vain, if my Philip has likewi&s;e gone before me, I bequeath this ca&s;ket to you. Share its contents, be benefi|cent, and remember me!"</P>
<P>When William ob&s;erved that &s;he was &s;ilent, and fixed her tearful eyes upon the ground, he took the liberty to repre&s;ent to her that &s;he was &s;till very young, and &s;tood more in need of a provi&s;ion&punc; than a brother, who could every where obtain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence in foreign military &s;ervice.

but no nobleman could live in &s;afety. "Such a flight," added he, "is difficult, and with|out money almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>Babet had li&s;tened to him with &s;ilence; and with a &s;orowful &s;mile, "Yes," &s;aid &s;he with a look of wild enthu&s;ia&s;m, "I will fly!&mdash;not fly&mdash;but de|part in triumph&mdash;and that is po&s;&s;ible&mdash;it is quite ea&s;y, without money.&mdash;You do not know, "pro|ceeded &s;he with a &s;ecret horror, while her eye &s;parkled benignantly, "you know not, that in ten days I &s;hall be with my father!" She looked to heaven with revere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al awe and devotion.</P>
<P>William a&s;ked her if &s;he was ill, that &s;he felt her&s;elf &s;o near death?</P>
<P>"O no!" replied &s;he, "God deals very graci|ou&s;ly with me; he takes me out of this world with|out &s;ickne&s;s." (She continued in a low and &s;olemn voice) "In ten days, towards evening, a violent &s;torm will take place; the wicked men around &s;hall tremble, but I &s;hall rejoice.&mdash;Then will the lightning &s;trike upon the turret which &s;tands there by the water &s;ide.

<P>As &s;he &s;poke this, &s;he betrayed an enthu&s;ia&s;tic rapture, and appeared her&s;elf to be tran&s;porte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with ec&s;ta&s;y. William gazad at her with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and began to think that her mind was di&s;|ordered. He &s;oon perceived that her mona&s;tic education and her early misfortunes had given her a tincture of &s;uper&s;titious enthu&s;ia&s;m. Se told them, that after her father's death, deprived of her rea&s;on, &s;he wandered through the grove day and night in wild de&s;pair, without &s;leep or refre&s;hment. One morning &s;he had &s;unk, exhau&s;ted, into a pro|found &s;lumber, and in a dream God had revealed to her that her deliverance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as at hand.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="035693_0183_100672CD6F1592D8">"Since that moment," pur&s;ued &s;he, "I have been in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;en&s;es; my &s;orrow has become more placid. I have prepared a coffin to receive my body, and an angel is de&s;tined to re|ceive my &s;pirit. Congratulate me, the hour is not far di&s;tant!"</P>
<P>With &s;ecret compa&s;&s;ion William li&s;tened to the vi&s;ionary maid; Frederick turned round, and dropped a &s;ilent tear. William was too well acquainted with mankind to know that argument and rea&s;on would here be fruitle&s;s. He rather appeared to have no doubt of the prophetic dream. He put the ca&s;ket in his pocket, and promi&s;ed punctually to fulfil her commands. By degrees he endeavored to awaken other images in her &s;oul, to withdraw her attention from that &s;ingle object on which &s;he in|ce&s;&s;antly gazed. He continued to give the con|ver&s;ation a direction towards indifferent topics, and even to matters connected with Babet's family. He made her talk of her brothers, their per&s;on, their character, the regiments in which they had &s;erved, and the vi&s;its they had formerly paid her in the cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>From this he naturally pa&s;&s;ed to inquiries con|cerning the mona&s;tic &s;y&s;tem of education. He affected to be more unacquainted with it than he really was. He inquired after the mode of life, the plan of in&s;truction, the connections and friend|&s;hip to which &s;uch a &s;cene gave ri&s;e.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t Babet &s;eemed to an&s;wer with reluctance; but, by degrees, &s;o many &s;cenes were recalled to her remembrance, &s;o many youthful incidents oc|curred to her fancy, that at la&s;t, if &s;he was not talkative, &s;he took part in the conver&s;ation. She related many anecdotes; and, at la&s;t, &s;he felt a plea&s;ure in relating them. In a word, the charm|ing vivacity which gradually di&s;played it&s;elf in her

whole conduct, clearly &s;howed that &s;he was for|med for cheerfulne&s;s, not for melancholy, and that &s;olitary grief alone could have produced &s;o violent an effect upon her temper.</P>
<P>She was a&s;toni&s;hed when morning dawned, was vexed at her di&s;&s;ipation, as &s;he called it, ba&s;hfully apologized, and took her leave, to allow her gue&s;ts to enjoy repo&s;e. William threw him&s;elf on the &s;traw. He &s;oon dropped into a placid &s;lumber, while Frederick paced through the cavern, &s;tand|ing &s;till occa&s;ionally on the &s;pot which Babet's foot had con&s;ecrated.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. THE RIGHTS OF NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>IT has an hundred times been &s;aid that flattery is a poi&s;on. Well! be it &s;o; but does it fol|low that it ought never to be employed? Do not the phy&s;icians pre&s;cribe poi&s;ons for the mo&s;t de&s;|perate di&s;ea&s;es?&mdash;Is not, for example, <HI>Belladonna</HI> con&s;idered an excellent remedy for a cancer?&mdash; And is not a deep rooted grief more dangerous than this cruel malady?</P>
<P>Such were William's reflections when be awoke, after a few hours &s;leep; and on them he formed the de&s;ign to beguile the &s;orrow of his benefac|tre&s;s by well-directed flattery. Really there are no means &s;o well calculated to withdraw men from &s;erious or gloomy objects, as this bal&s;am properly applied. You mu&s;t be careful, however, not to betray the de&s;ign. It mu&s;t not be a vi&s;ible e&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

it mu&s;t be an invi&s;ible perfume. It mu&s;t not de|&s;cend in &s;howers like the atmo&s;phere of our earth, but, like that of the moon, it mu&s;t di&s;til in dew. Oh! there is not a &s;age in the univer&s;e who could with&s;tand the effect of this &s;oothing anodyne.</P>
<P>When Babet returned, about noon, and brought with her, for the entertainment of her gue&s;ts, what nature in the ravaged garden &s;till offered un&s;olicit|ed, William began to play his part. He could not calculate indeed upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friend, for the man who truly loves cannot flatter. He &s;ummoned all his knowledge of the human heart, and all his experience. What he had often &s;een in the world, and had treated only with contempt, he now endeavored to imitate. Pity and gratitude communicated an irre&s;i&s;tible force to his words, and an ardor before which Babet's coldne&s;s began to melt. Sometimes he was able to extort a &s;mile from her; and when &s;he detected her&s;elf in it, a &s;tolen &s;igh &s;eemed to a&s;k forgivene&s;s of her father's &s;pirit. Before two hours had elap&s;ed, William's flattering tongue had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that the lovely mourner &s;at down to table with her gue&s;ts and &s;hared the fruits &s;he had provided.</P>
<P>Day flew rapidly away. Babet with regret &s;aw evening approach, for &s;he had in&s;en&s;ibly acquired a ta&s;te for &s;ociety. Her eye often dwelt with parti|cular complacency on William, who principally &s;up|ported the conver&s;ation. His unembarra&s;&s;ed heart allowed him to di&s;play all his amiable qualities, while Frederick &s;at dreaming by his &s;ide, and, for fear of &s;aying &s;omething &s;illy, cho&s;e to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>When the &s;hades of night began to clo&s;e round, Babet &s;ent the girl and the footman out, different ways, to learn whether the tempe&s;t, which had ra|ged &s;o violently, was yet allayed. Both returned like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oah's pigeons with the olive-branch. How|ever &s;atisfactory this intelligence might be, it was
<PB N="188" REF="035693_0186_100672D46EF30718">
received with welcome by nobody but William, who was extremely anxious to return to town, be|cau&s;e he was afraid that he and his companion might be mi&s;&s;ed, and con&s;idered as de&s;erters.</P>
<P>His friend was not at pre&s;ent affected by the&s;e con&s;iderations. He wi&s;hed to &s;ee the villa as thick|ly &s;urrounded by murderers, as the nightly traveller in &s;ome regions of Africa &s;ees him&s;elf &s;urrounded by moving fires, for he felt courage to defend Babet again&s;t a ho&s;t; and he found that it was in &s;uch moments alone that he could te&s;tify to her his love. As no enemy, however, was to be &s;een, and as the fields were occupied only by crickets and gra&s;shopp|ers; as the owls glided out and in through the broken windows of the man&s;ion, the two friends prepared for their departure.</P>
<P>Babet was pen&s;ive and melancholy when they went away. She accompanied them to the iron gate, and gave them her hand as they took leave. "Providence above," &s;aid &s;he, "has brought us together&mdash;be to me as brothers while I continue to &s;ojourn here below.&mdash;It is but ten days to the wi&s;h|ed for hour&mdash;vi&s;it your &s;i&s;ter &s;ometimes before &s;he goes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence, provided you can do it without dan|ger."</P>
<P>Frederick &s;miled at the word <HI>danger.</HI> William promi&s;ed to come, were it even in <HI>di&s;gui&s;e.</HI> Frede|rick &s;miled at the word <HI>di&s;gui&s;e.</HI> He had ki&s;&s;ed Babet's hand.&mdash;She had called him brother.&mdash; Where is the danger?&mdash;Why di&s;gui&s;e?</P>
<P>They took their leave. Frederick often &s;topped to look back, though it was quite dark. Babet &s;tood at the gate, and li&s;tened to the foot&s;teps of her gue&s;ts, which &s;ounded through the &s;ilent night. She then &s;lowly returned.&mdash;She thought of going to the grotto, to her father's body, yet de&s;cended pen&s;ive to the cavern. She threw her&s;elf on the bed of &s;traw, to meditate fully on her approaching death.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="035693_0187_100672D63B3A6638">Since her acquaintance with William, this idea &s;eemed to have acquired new charms, for with the &s;olemn image of death &s;he a&s;&s;ociated the agreeable picture of her new brother. She re&s;olved, that up|on the eventful day he &s;hould not leave her. She &s;aw her&s;elf, &s;truck lifele&s;s by the lightning, &s;ink into his arms&mdash;&s;he thought how he would &s;tretch her body tenderly upon the gra&s;s&mdash;how he would kneel be&s;ide her&mdash;A tear dropped from his eye on her cold hand&mdash;and at the thought her cheek glowed&mdash; he impre&s;&s;es a brother's ki&s;s upon her pallid lips!</P>
<P>Thus were a&s;&s;ociated with the thoughts of death many delightful images, drawn by the pencil of pure&s;t innocence in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing colours. Death indeed &s;till was in the per&s;pective of the picture, but with a fainter light than the more cap|tivating features. She expected, with a degree of impatience, a &s;econd vi&s;it from her gue&s;ts. She no longer lay uncon&s;cious on her father's coffin, but &s;at upon it wi&s;tfully, and li&s;tened to the murmur of the waters which da&s;hed on the banks of the little I&s;land. The nightingale &s;ung in the grove, and &s;he blamed her&s;elf beau&s;e his melody gave her plea&s;ure. The &s;ervant brought her a pigeon for dinner. She chid him for &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he could be hungry; and when he was gone, &s;he ate fir&s;t one wing, then ano|ther, then the whole pigeon.</P>
<P>A &s;oft and &s;ecret melancholy &s;ometimes drove her from the grotto to the hou&s;e, from the windows of which &s;he had a view of the road, both on the right and left. She walked up and down through the empty apartment, and &s;ometimes threw a &s;tolen glance on the &s;hattered looking-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, poor Frederick, ill at heart, &s;talked about like a &s;pectre, and mu&s;t have bled to death of the deep wound he had received, had not his friend, with unwearied attention, poured into it the balm of hope. As the words of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> are to

a lover &s;acred as holy writ, Frederick, notwith|&s;tanding his excellent under&s;tanding, was not di&s;in|clined to believe that really in ten days a &s;troke of lightning would tear Babet from him; and William was obliged to laugh him out of this conceit, &s;ince to rea&s;on him out of it was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Even although, perhaps, Babet &s;hould be &s;aved from the dreaded lightning, would &s;he be di&s;po&s;ed to forget her grief in his arms? The hope appear|ed too bold, for true love would make even a Nar|ci&s;&s;us mode&s;t! William, who coolly con&s;idered the &s;ituation of affairs, endeavored to remove every doubt, and to convince the timid lover that Babet's youthful innocence, her de&s;titute &s;ituation, and the unoccupied &s;tate of her heart, would enable him to &s;ecure her affection. He encouraged him, at lea&s;t, to make his eyes the interpreters of his heart, and not to appear ever before her with downca&s;t looks. Frederick promi&s;ed every thing, but did not keep his word; for fir&s;t love embarra&s;&s;es every motion, becau&s;e it is ever fearful to offend.</P>
<P>They received a very agreeable piece of intelli|gence on their return to town. The per&s;ons who had cut down the tree of liberty, had been taken in another village, and condemned to an ignominious puni&s;hment. The two friends, therefore, were enabled, without danger, to continue their little ex|cur&s;ions, and Frederick wi&s;hed to avail him&s;elf of this liberty, though a circum&s;tance in it&s;elf very in|different, to prevail upon William to pay Babet a &s;econd vi&s;it the following day. William, however, more cool than his friend, was afraid that the en|thu&s;ia&s;tic girl might be di&s;plea&s;ed, and thought it better to wait till the day after.</P>
<P>Frederick cur&s;ed the coldne&s;s of his companion, &s;tood the whole day che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rle&s;s at the window, and wondered to &s;ee the people pur&s;uing their occupa|tions &s;o coolly. When it was &s;carce midnight, he
<PB N="191" REF="035693_0189_100672DA9D1914D8">
rou&s;ed William, who lay fa&s;t a&s;leep, and maintained that it was already day-break. It was but the de|clining moon, which &s;hot a feeble ray into their apartment.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the ea&s;tern horizon was over&s;pread with purple clouds, and before the fir&s;t rays of the &s;un peeped through the grey twilight, the two friends were already in the &s;treet. The doors were all &s;hut, and their foot&s;teps alone re&s;ounded along the empty pavement. They had this time loaded their pockets with all kinds of provi&s;ions, and hoped to prevail upon their benefactre&s;s to partake of a frugal meal. William meditated, as he walked along, how he &s;hould tempt her from the gloomy grotto, where the terrific objects it contained furni&s;hed fre&s;h food for her grief. His care, however, was unnece&s;&s;ary; for when the travellers arrived at the iron gate, they &s;aw Babet &s;itting under a lime-tree on the lawn, feeding her two hens with crumbs of bread.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vely creature blu&s;hed mode&s;tly, and bade them kindly welcome. William &s;ecretly made the agreeable remark that her hair was dre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome degree of care, and that her bo&s;om was more &s;tudiou&s;ly covered than it was the fir&s;t time they &s;aw her.</P>
<P>They all &s;at down under the lime-tree. The conver&s;ation of the little circle, indeed, was con|&s;trained. They &s;eemed to be afraid to di&s;play any &s;ymptoms of joy. The lovely dreamer was &s;ome|what hurt to perceive that all allu&s;ion to her afflic|tion was carefully avoided, and &s;he her&s;elf likewi&s;e forbore to mention it. William exerted every ef|fort in his power to animate the conver&s;ation, and he &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded. Babet appeared to feel his anxiety with gratitude, and repaid his exertions by many kind looks. In a word, her natural feel|ings for the plea&s;ures of life awoke. She again
<PB N="192" REF="035693_0190_100672DD54E54228">
re&s;umed an intere&s;t in what pa&s;&s;ed around her. Of Frederick's love, however, &s;he entertained no &s;u&s;|picion. A more experienced girl would have gue&s;&s;|ed, from his vacant &s;tare, his embarra&s;&s;ment when &s;he &s;poke to him, the blu&s;h upon his cheeks when her eye met his, what pa&s;&s;ed in his heart. But Babet, educated in the &s;eclu&s;ion of a cloi&s;ter, never &s;u&s;pected the power of her charms.</P>
<P>The day pa&s;&s;ed in the utmo&s;t harmony. Babet led her gue&s;ts through the fields, the meadows, and gardens, pointed out and de&s;cribed to them all its former beauties, every place that was now de&s;troy|ed. She dwelt with a melancholy plea&s;ure on every &s;pot which had been the favorite of her fa|ther, and &s;aid, that if &s;he were not &s;o well convinced of her &s;peedy death, &s;he could not endure the me|lancholy pro&s;pect of the&s;e &s;cenes, but would fly from her country.</P>
<P>William &s;eized this opportunity to de&s;cant on the charms of his native land, and to declare with what cordial welcome &s;he would there be received. He lamented that fate denied him the plea&s;ure of being her deliverer. He ventured even to expre&s;s the wi&s;h that his prayers might avert the fatal lightning.</P>
<P>He then watched her countenance unob&s;erved, to &s;ee whether &s;he betrayed any di&s;like at &s;uch an idea; and he had the &s;atisfaction to perceive that, though &s;he was &s;ilent, her downca&s;t looks te&s;tified &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, not di&s;plea&s;ure. Contented with his fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, he broke off the conver&s;ation, and left to her own imagination to complete the &s;ketch in &s;olitude.</P>
<P>When evening began to &s;pread its &s;hades, the party &s;eparated, with the promi&s;e of &s;eeing each other daily till the fatal hour arrived. Poor Fre|derick's heart was more deeply pierced than ever, for Babet, in a few hours, with &s;i&s;terly &s;olicitude,

developed the whole charms of her &s;oul; and an innocence, which Ge&s;&s;ner's pencil alone could pour|tray, diffu&s;ed round her per&s;onal cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the glory of an angel.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. THE SPECTRE.</HEAD>
<P>REVIEWERS and undertakers re&s;emble each other in this, that they both perform their re&s;pective functions for hire; the latter are paid to mourn, the former to abu&s;e. Both of them are engaged indeed in preci&s;ely the &s;ame occupation, that of making hired critici&s;ms, the latter upon men who are carried to the grave; the former upon books, which people are at perfect liberty, if they plea&s;e, to carry to the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>Should any body ob&s;erve that this remark is very un&s;ea&s;onable upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I have two an&s;wers ready. Fir&s;t, I follow the example of Cato, who, whatever &s;ubject might have been di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed in the &s;enate, always concluded his &s;peech with: <HI>Coeter&ugrave;m puto Carthaginem e&s;&s;e delen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>; and
<PB N="194" REF="035693_0192_100672E064C930C8">
the authority of this great example mu&s;t be the more conclu&s;ive for my ju&s;tification, as the republic of letters would evidently gain a great deal more by the extermination of Reviewers than Rome could do by the de&s;truction of Carthage.</P>
<P>Secondly, this remark is not quite &s;o foreign from the purpo&s;e as on the fir&s;t glance might be imagined; for this true hi&s;tory now is at that very period which gives the Prometheu&s;es among the reviewers an opportunity to &s;urpa&s;s the work of the gods. Babet, will they &s;ay, the rapt enthu&s;ia&s;t, that &s;carce &s;eemed to touch the earth, now too ea&s;ily admits of con&s;olation, and forgets the mur|der of her father and brothers, as &s;oon as if merely her lap-dog had torn her handkerchief. <HI>There is no con&s;i&s;tency in the character!</HI></P>
<P>Very well, gentlemen! It is a pity, however, that mother Nature cares as little for your &s;age rulers as a lam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kin in the meads would care for a dancing-ma&s;ter, who &s;hould pre&s;cribe how he ought to &s;kip. The celebrated Mr. <HI>Huber</HI> (I had almo&s;t forgot to add, author of the <HI>Secret Tribunal</HI>) &s;ome|where ob&s;erves, that "Brutus is the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;t|ent character in the hi&s;tory of the world." Although &s;uch a remark is advanced only becau&s;e it &s;ounds extraordinary, it follows, from this hyper-critic's own confe&s;&s;ion, that there are very few con&s;i&s;tent characters in the hi&s;tory of the world. The author of the world, we all know, is dame Nature; and if &s;he exhau&s;ted her powers on Brutus, Babet may ju&s;tly hope to be forgiven.</P>
<P>We candidly acknowledge, therefore, that the good young lady, in con&s;equence of the repeated vi&s;its of her new brothers, di&s;covered in the la&s;t ten days of her life a quite different temper of mind from that which &s;he had di&s;played when &s;he rejec|ted the ca&s;ket, with contempt of all terre&s;trial things. She was now attached to life by &s;ecret wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="035693_0193_100672E452FC07F8">Three days had Babet, according to her calcu|lation, &s;till to live. On the fir&s;t &s;he confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had too precipitately prayed for death; on the &s;e|cond &s;he even ventured to think that God too ha&s;tily had granted her prayer; and on the third &s;he trem|bled for the &s;ucceeding morn.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as William ob&s;erved this favourable di&s;|po&s;ition, he began to &s;ugge&s;t doubts of the fulfill|ment of the prophetic dream. He repeated a number of examples of dreams which had never been fulfilled. He explained as well as he could (for who can perfectly explain it?) the effect of the &s;tate of the blood, or exce&s;&s;ive agitation of the corporeal organs, upon the mind of the &s;leeper. Babet did not under&s;tand him; but &s;he li&s;tened with re&s;pect, and &s;ecretly wi&s;hed he might be right.</P>
<P>She had in&s;en&s;ibly conceived a &s;trong attachment to William; with this attachment was connected a &s;i&s;terly confidence, and in their walks &s;he clung to his &s;ide with as little con&s;traint as if he had been one of the nuns with whom &s;he u&s;ed to walk in the gardens of the convent. Frederick, on the con|trary, &s;eemed only the moon, which borrowed a feeble ray from the friendly &s;un. She e&s;teemed him likewi&s;e, but it was more with a feeling of friend&s;hip. How could it be otherwi&s;e? Love had veiled all his &s;plendid and amiable qualities in the mi&s;t of re&s;erve.</P>
<P>When, on the evening before the awful day, they &s;eparated with beating hearts, the lovely Ba|bet, with trembling voice, entreated her friends to return very early next day, that &s;he might not be utterly de&s;erted in her la&s;t hour. William prom|i&s;ed for both; and as the &s;ultry evening really portended a &s;torm, they &s;carce went an hundred yards from Babet's hou&s;e, to be nearer at hand, and took up their lodgings at an inn.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="035693_0194_100672E5D5B8D250">A lover, as all the world knows, is ever in ex|tremes. He is in raptures or in de&s;pair; he is dumb or talkative; and when in the humour to &s;peak, his &s;ubject is &s;o inexhau&s;tible, that he commonly &s;pares the hearer the trouble of an an&s;wer; and a tree or a man, therefore, are often equally his con|fidantes. That Frederick, in the &s;ilence of night, in the &s;leeple&s;s hours, &s;hould dwell upon the charms of his beloved; that he &s;hould de&s;cant with all his eloquence on Babet's beauty and innocence, was quite as natural as that William, who could hope to hear nothing new on this &s;ubject, &s;hould fall a&s;leep. Receiving no an&s;wer to his que&s;tions, and hearing his companion breathe louder than before, the orator at length perceived that he was uttering his complaints to the bare walls. He was unwil|ling to di&s;turb his friend's &s;lumber; he ro&s;e, went out, and groped his way in the dark along the road.</P>
<P>As during the la&s;t ten days he had formed an ac|quaintance with every &s;tone and tree which &s;tood or lay in the road to Babet's hou&s;e, it was not dif|ficult for him, in &s;pite of the darkne&s;s which &s;ur|rounded him, to find the well-known path to the abode of his beloved, without &s;tumbling or knock|ing his head again&s;t a po&s;t. He arrived &s;afe at the iron gate, and through the rails contemplated with &s;ighs the broken windows, from which a &s;olitary lamp &s;hed a feeble light. He walked backwards and forwards, breathed lengthened &s;ighs, and in the &s;ilence of night repeated, &s;ometimes aloud, &s;ometimes in a low voice, the name of Babet.</P>
<P>Alas! he knew not what agoni&s;ing tortures he had occa&s;ioned his beloved by this nocturnal ex|cur&s;ion. The timorous maiden had &s;tood at the window ever &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her friends had left her, gazing at the gloomy clouds, which gathered in the we&s;t, and &s;eemed to carry in their bo&s;om the arrow of death. The di&s;tant lightning increa&s;ed her ap|prehen&s;ion
<PB N="197" REF="035693_0195_100672E7A797F898">
&mdash;her heart trembled as often as the fla&s;h bur&s;t from the cloud!</P>
<P>But what were her feelings when, by this hor|rid light, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;aw a figure walking back|wards and forwards at the iron gate!&mdash;when &s;he heard profound &s;ighs, and di&s;tinctly heard her name pronounced!</P>
<P><HI>My father's gho&s;t!</HI>&mdash;The idea &s;truck horror through her whole frame, and her teeth chattered.&mdash;"The gho&s;t of my father &s;ummons me hence!&mdash;My dream was no idle phantom of the brain!&mdash;My la&s;t hour approaches!&mdash;The &s;pirits of the dead are ready to receive me!"</P>
<P>She dropped down upon her knees, and attempt|ed to pray; but &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the floor. Frederick, uncon&s;cious of the mi&s;chief he had done, had now fini&s;hed his romantic excur&s;ion; for the light &s;treaks which appeared in the ea&s;t announced the coming day. He returned and awaked his friend. With the fir&s;t dawn of the morning they were at the door.</P>
<P>They a&s;cended the &s;tair without noi&s;e and found the &s;ervants &s;till buried in &s;leep. They imagined that Babet was likewi&s;e in bed. William opened the door of her room as carefully as a mother who is fearful of di&s;turbing the &s;lumbers of her &s;ick child. Frederick &s;tood behind him, and threw a timid glance over his &s;houlders. The maid lay &s;tretched upon the door.</P>
<P>"She is a&s;leep," whi&s;pered William, and was about to retire. But Frederick, with ill pre&s;aging alarm, advanced nearer, took her hand, found it cold as clay, and &s;creamed, "She is dead!&mdash;The terrors of imagination have killed her!" William endeavoured without &s;ucce&s;s, to moderate the tran&s;|ports of his grief. He ran through the room like a per&s;on frantic and exclaimed in agonizing de|&s;pair:
<PB N="198" REF="035693_0196_100672E92BBD4FB8">
"She is gone!&mdash;Is there now a compa&s;|&s;ionate thunderbolt re&s;erved for me!" With wild cries he threw him&s;elf on the &s;uppo&s;ed corp&s;e&mdash; with frantic grief he &s;prang up to look for &s;ome weapon to put an end to his mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. William begged and threatened&mdash;&s;ometimes with tenderne&s;s, &s;ometimes with anger&mdash;in vain! Frederick, heard him not&mdash;till at la&s;t his friend &s;eized him forcibly in his arms, and &s;houted in his ear: Man! are you mad?&mdash;She is not dead!&mdash;her heart beats &s;till!"</P>
<P>Frederick now threw him&s;elf down tran&s;ported be&s;ide his beloved, laid his trembling hand upon her heart, felt it beat, and to the mo&s;t violent grief &s;ucceeded the mo&s;t immoderate expre&s;&s;ions of joy. He pre&s;&s;ed William to his brea&s;t&mdash;embraced the old footman&mdash;he wept, and &s;houted. He never thought of applying the proper means to recover her from the &s;woon&mdash;it was enough that &s;he was alive&mdash;her heart beat, he thanked heaven with en|thu&s;ia&s;m!</P>
<P>Meanwhile, William had rou&s;ed the &s;ervant. Cold &s;pring water was the only cordial with which &s;he could &s;upply him. He &s;prinkled Babet's face, rubbed her arms and temples, and in a few minutes &s;he opened her eyes.</P>
<P>She looked round wildly, and eagerly pre&s;&s;ed William's hand. "I thank you," &s;aid &s;he, "for having come &s;o early.&mdash;Soon, very &s;oon, and my death-hour knells." William led her to the win|dows, pointed out to her the beauties of the blu&s;h|ing morn, remarked how the black clouds di&s;per|&s;ed, how the thick mo&s;t formed an ocean in the valley, all indications of a plea&s;ant day. The blu&s;h|ing morn, however, had no charms for Babet. Her eye gazed wildly at the iron gate&mdash;there was the place where the &s;pectre &s;talked&mdash;thence i&s;&s;ued the di&s;mal groans&mdash;thence it had called the name of
<PB N="199" REF="035693_0197_100889A6B1AEC3E8">
Babet. In vain did William endeavor to amu&s;e her mind, and to withdraw her attention from the object on which it dwelt. "Leave me, &s;aid &s;he, "I mu&s;t die&mdash;too &s;ure this day I die&mdash;My father's gho&s;t has appeared to me&mdash;his warning &s;ummons has rou&s;ed me from my &s;inful hopes.&mdash;I go to pre|pare for death."</P>
<P>Without farther explanation re&s;pecting the na|ture of the apparition, &s;he retired into an adjoining room to pray. A&s;toni&s;hed and chagrined, William looked at her, and cur&s;ed the demon that, with &s;ome new phanta&s;y of a di&s;ordered imagination, had bla&s;ted the fruits of his exertions. In vain the two friends endeavoured to gather from the dome&s;tics, whether, &s;ince la&s;t night, any thing ex|traordinary had occurred. They knew of nothing. Babet had ordered them to go to bed, and they obeyed without oppo&s;ition, for it was no new thing for their mi&s;tre&s;s not to undre&s;s at all. William could now no longer conceal the impre&s;&s;ion which the circum&s;tance made upon his mind. He dreaded not indeed any miracle of nature; but he dreaded the wonderful effects of imagination, which, &s;o of|ten governed by phantoms of its own creation, &s;ilences the feeble voice of rea&s;on. In a word, he dreaded not Babet's death, but, what is wor&s;e than&punc; death&mdash;madne&s;s. He endeavored, as well as he could, to conceal the&s;e melancholy thoughts from his friend, who walked about with tottering &s;teps and folded hands, in vi&s;ible agitation. Sometimes he &s;tood gazing at the door through which &s;he had di&s;appeared. Sometimes he &s;topped &s;hort, looked at him wi&s;tfully, as if to &s;eek con&s;olation in his eye.</P>
<P>After the lap&s;e of an hour Babet returned to the room, and a &s;upernatural &s;erenity &s;at maje&s;tic upon her brow. She &s;poke little, an&s;wered &s;hortly, and &s;eemed afraid to drop a &s;ingle word that could indi|cate
<PB N="200" REF="035693_0198_10064D489A62AB50">
a doubt of her approaching death&mdash;as if &s;he feared to lo&s;e that compo&s;ure and re&s;ignation &s;he had prayed from heaven.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was very con&s;trained. Of dreams, apparitions, and dying, the brothers would not talk, and the &s;i&s;ter would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear of nothing el&s;e. They walked up and down together, almo&s;t in &s;ilence. From Frederick's brea&s;t heaved long heavy &s;ighs, as if he him&s;elf had been condemned to die. Babet walked about in &s;till meditation, not a breath, not a foot&s;tep was heard. Spirits &s;kim along the earth&mdash;and Babet was already almo&s;t di&s;embodied.</P>
<P>William, from time to time, went to the window, and failed not always to ob&s;erve, that the morning was delightful and &s;erene, that not a threating cloud hung on the horizon. The vi&s;ionary maid how|ever, heard his remarks with indifference, for the voice of the &s;pectre &s;till vibrated in her ear.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. THE STORM.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the &s;un had advanced far towards the meridian, and an oppre&s;&s;ive heat announced the highe&s;t influence of his reign; when his burn|ing rays penetrated through the un&s;haded windows into the apartment, Babet her&s;elf propo&s;ed a walk in the grove. It was not, indeed, in order to re|fre&s;h her&s;elf in the cooling &s;hade; for &s;he would have been a&s;hamed, when at the very verge of the world of &s;pirits, to have expre&s;&s;ed any corporeal
<PB N="201" REF="035693_0199_10064D4A6D7F4338">
inconvenience. She wi&s;hed unob&s;erved to approach the turret which her dream had pointed out as the termination of her pilgrimage, and the humanity which &s;till adhered to her, taught her the tender delicacy of concealing this circum&s;tance from her anxious friends.</P>
<P>William &s;eized the proffered plan of amu&s;ement, &s;light as it was. They went out; and the good-hearted William, who&s;e &s;u&s;picions had wan|dered into a wrong track, &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavored to conduct her far from the little i&s;land and the hideous grotto. Babet ob&s;erved it, and &s;aid with a &s;mile: "Why this anxiety?&mdash;Why &s;hould I now with to vi&s;it the melancholy remains of my father, &s;ince in a few hours I &s;hall &s;ee him in glory?"</P>
<P>William &s;ighed &s;oftly at her invincible credulity, and Frederick &s;orrowfully broke the twigs as he pa&s;&s;ed along from every bu&s;h. At la&s;t the &s;ultry noon-day heat compelled them to &s;eek the mo&s;t &s;hady place of the grove, where a gravel foot-path led to a &s;olitary hermitage which received only a feeble light through a little window, round which ivy and wild hopes were entwined.</P>
<P>Here a mo&s;&s;y bank invited them to re&s;t from their fatigue. Babet &s;eated her&s;elf between her two brothers; and William, who found that it was important to talk, be the &s;ubject what it might, in order to divert the attention of the vi&s;ionary, took up the mo&s;t indifferent topics. He de&s;canted upon the beauty of the butterfly, and the indu&s;|try of the ant. At la&s;t, a coat of arms, which was pointed on one of the panes, afforded matter for along and intere&s;ting conver&s;ation. Among many other u&s;ele&s;s things, Babet in the cloi&s;ter had likewi&s;e learnt heraldry. The artful William, who really under&s;tood little of the &s;ubject, affected to be more ignorant than he really was, and with exem|plary patience led her to explain all the mummery
<PB N="202" REF="035693_0200_10064D4D51BF4238">
of cre&s;ts, &s;upporters, &amp;c. When upon a critical occa&s;ion it is important to withdraw the mind from &s;ome ruling object, the mo&s;t trifling means are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;ince by the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas they awaken they produce the happie&s;t ef|fects. Babet exhau&s;ted the &s;cience &s;he had acquir|ed in the cloi&s;ter on the arms of her female friends, who&s;e images recurred to her mind as &s;he dwelt upon topics with which they were connected, or renewed the faded recollection of pa&s;t &s;cenes. In|&s;en&s;ibly the &s;ubject withdrew her from the gloomy contemplation of death. Who knows how far William might have &s;ucceeded, for two hours had thus clap&s;ed, when &s;uddenly the noi&s;e of the di&s;tant thunder &s;truck alarm into the little party!</P>
<P>Babet grew pale&mdash;the blood for&s;ook Frederick's cheeks&mdash;even William was di&s;concerted, and &s;ecretly repined at fortune, which &s;eemed re&s;olved &s;till farther to prove the poor &s;uper&s;titious maid. All three &s;prang up, and ha&s;tened to the door. The horizon was overca&s;t, the wind howled through the trees, the croaking ravens flew to their ne&s;ts, and the birds flattered about in alarm.</P>
<P>Babet folded her trembling hands: "Follow me!" &s;aid &s;he with faltering voice; "leave me not!"</P>
<P>Frederick was &s;o confounded and agitated by what he &s;aw, and what he felt, that he knew not what he did. "Would to God!" &s;aid he as he &s;eized Babet's hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it eagerly, "would to God I could die with you!"&mdash;She &s;tarted, and gazed at him wildly. She then gently di&s;engaged her&s;elf, and flew &s;o rapidly through the thick bu&s;h|es, that the two friends could hardly follow her. The &s;torm approached nearer and nearer, the big drops fell, the wind whi&s;tled, and the ru&s;tling leaves were &s;haken from the trees.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reathle&s;s ran Babet through a meadow, which
<PB N="203" REF="035693_0201_10064D5026123B28">
the river formed into a penin&s;ula, at the extremity of which &s;tood the ruins of the old tower, under the nodding walls of which &s;he re&s;olved to bury her&s;elf. William followed her clo&s;e, and over|took her ju&s;t as &s;he &s;unk down exhau&s;ted upon a &s;tone, and &s;tretched out her arms to Heaven to re|ceive the angel of death.</P>
<P>Her brothers kneeled by her &s;ide. With ter|ror and the agitation of her rapid race her brea&s;t was like to bur&s;t. William looked round&punc; and perceived that in this dangerous &s;ituation accident might very ea&s;ily realize Babet's prophetic dream; for the turret was &s;urrounded by tall oaks, who&s;e tops defied the tempe&s;t, and &s;eemed boldly to tempt the lightning down. But it would have been in vain to mention this danger. The luckle&s;s Babet was already almo&s;t in the agonies of death.</P>
<P>The black cloud hung directly over their head &mdash;the thunder pealed tremendous&mdash;the lightning darted quicker and more vivid&mdash;the wind &s;uddenly died away&mdash;the rain cea&s;ed&mdash;a &s;ullen &s;ilence reign|ed over the &s;ullen land&s;cape&mdash;a &s;ultry breeze taint|ed every flower&mdash;death &s;eemed to hang the threat|ning clouds in maffy chains over their heads&mdash; Babet breathed languid&mdash;the lu&s;tre of her eye was faded&mdash;Hark! the lightning cra&s;hes upon the tur|ret, &s;hivers the wall, the ruins roll into the river, and the earth trembles.</P>
<P>"<HI>Je&s;u Maria!</HI>" cried a voice from the mid&s;t of the ruins.&mdash;Babet lay lifele&s;s on the ground&mdash;the hail de&s;cended in torrents&mdash;Frederick was motion|le&s;s&mdash;William lifted Babet, who lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s, cov|ered her with his great coat, and turned towards the ruins, from whence the voice had i&s;&s;ued. He &s;aw, and &s;huddered.&mdash;Through the gaping wall, between &s;tones which &s;till &s;eparated and tumbled down, appeared the figure of a young man as if ri&s;ing out of the grave. Pale and haggard, covered
<PB N="204" REF="035693_0202_10064D51E81A3C40">
only with a few rags, he gazed wildly it the &s;tran|gers, and advanced in &s;ilence like a &s;pectre.</P>
<P>"Who art thou?" cried William. The &s;pectre an&s;wered not. The rain beat on his uncovered head; he vi&s;ibly trembled, and endeavored to hide his naked limbs. Rou&s;ed by William's &s;ummons, his friend turned round, and gazed at the figure, which in&s;pired a mingled feeling of compa&s;&s;ion and fear. He &s;prang up, advanced ha&s;tily towards the apparition, and cried in a rougher voice, "Who are you? What do you want?"</P>
<P>"Spare me!" &s;aid the young man with trem|bling voice; "you &s;ee that God has now &s;pared me.&mdash;I beheld from the turret how you kneeled&punc; by the &s;ide of this virtuous maid.&mdash;Happy for me that you prize her &s;o much! My Babet will pray for me!"</P>
<P>"<HI>Your</HI> Babet?" cried Frederick &s;tarting back, and eyeing the figure with doubtful penetrating looks, and reluctantly perceived in him an hand|&s;ome young man, whom want and mi&s;ery had worn to the bone.</P>
<P>"<HI>Your Babet!</HI>" repeated William with curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>"<HI>My Babet!</HI>" &s;aid the young man &s;omewhat more firmly, and advanced uninterrupted to the lifele&s;s maid, kneeled be&s;ide her, and endeavoured to warm her cold hands between his. Frederick &s;tood gazing &s;peechle&s;s&mdash;an indignant feeling darted through his heart. He felt as if the odious wi&s;h aro&s;e in his mind that Babet might never awake.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the &s;tormy clouds had &s;pent their fury, the thunder now rolled at a greater di&s;tance, a &s;oft &s;hower revived the earth, the flowers again reared their heads, the birds began to twitter; with the birds and the flowers Babet al&s;o awoke, and found her&s;elf&mdash;in the arms of her brother.</P>
<P>His countenance was the fir&s;t object which met her half-opened eyes; it was not extraordinary,
<PB N="205" REF="035693_0203_10064D5378D1B720">
therefore, that her imagination, a&s;&s;ailed by dreams and by realities, &s;hould fancy that &s;he awoke in L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y&s;ium. She thought her&s;elf decea&s;ed, and tran&s;|ported to the abodes of the ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"My brother Philip!" &s;aid &s;he in feeble accents, "has death again united us?&mdash;Where is our father? &mdash;Why comes he not to receive his daughter?"</P>
<P>When he heard the un&s;u&s;picious name of bro|ther, peace returned to Frederick's brea&s;t. The youth, again&s;t whom he thought he had felt an emotion of hatred, &s;uddenly became dear to him&mdash; he was Babet's brother!</P>
<P>It was a long time before Babet could per&s;uade her&s;elf that &s;he was really alive; the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pir|it of her brother before her &s;upported the decep|tion, which was not in any degree removed by the pre&s;ence of her friends, for &s;he believed that they too had been killed by the lightning. The youth, by lengthened mi&s;ery and continual danger, from which he had not yet e&s;caped, was weakened both in mind and body; he &s;till con&s;idered the &s;trangers as pur&s;uers, who thir&s;ted for his blood. In Frederick's bo&s;om, joy on Babet's recovery &s;truggled with the apprehen&s;ion of what might be the con&s;equence of her having found a brother, who might perhaps di&s;approve his love. The&s;e doubts kept him pen&s;ive and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>William was the only one who, in a few min|utes, recovered his pre&s;ence of mind. He ob&s;erv|ed that this place, drenched with rain, and the melancholy pro&s;pect of the ruins, was not calcula|ted for receiving mutual explanations. He made a &s;ign to his friend to lead the exhau&s;ted Babet home, while he him&s;elf &s;upported her tottering brother. The way was long through the dripping grove. Whenever a drop from the branches fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pon Babet's hand or cheeks, the poor maid &s;tarted&punc;

<P>Frederick's eyes hung upon her with anxious &s;olicitude; her arm lay in his; he trembled like the a&s;pen-tree, who&s;e overhanging leaves cooled the glow of his cheeks; it was the mo&s;t painful journey he had ever performed. He thought he &s;hould never be able to reach its termination; he looked towards the hou&s;e, and yet wi&s;hed that it were miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>William was examined with keenne&s;s and ap|prehen&s;ion by his haggard companion. The near|er they approached the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, the more his hollow eye te&s;tified &s;u&s;picion and unea&s;ine&s;s. Often he was on the point of running away, and probably he would have yielded to this impul&s;e had he felt him&s;elf &s;trong enough to e&s;cape from two vigorous pur&s;uers. He trembled as he entered the hou&s;e, and his confidence did not return till on the &s;tair he met the faithful old footman, who threw him&s;elf at his feet with &s;houts or joy.</P>
<P>They at la&s;t reached Babet's apartment, where the brother and &s;i&s;ter viewed every thing around them with looks of wildne&s;s and &s;urpri&s;e. William pre&s;cribed for them refre&s;hment and repo&s;e, medi|cines of powerful virtue even for di&s;ea&s;ed minds.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. THE SEPARATION.</HEAD>
<P>CHEVALIER BELLOY, the &s;ame whom his &s;i&s;ter imagined to be on his way to America, had &s;een his father and brother murdered by his &s;ide, and had withdrawn him&s;elf from the fury of his per&s;ecutors by taking an a&s;ylum among &s;ome inacce&s;&s;ible ruins, which in the amu&s;ements of his boyi&s;h days had been thoroughly explored, and were perfectly familiar to him. Here he ventured for many weeks only to creep out with the owls, to gather wild roots and fruits for his &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. At fir&s;t he &s;uppo&s;ed that the whole man|&s;ion was de&s;troyed, and that his &s;i&s;ter too had fal|len a prey to the rage of his &s;anguinary per&s;ecu|tors, till one day, through the chink of his retreat, he &s;aw her in deep &s;orrow walking at the foot of the tower.</P>
<P>He was on the point of running down to throw him&s;elf into her arms, when he was deterred by a dread of the loud expre&s;&s;ions of her &s;udden joy. He did not know who might be in the neighbourhood; whether &s;he might not be a pri&s;oner. Had he not rea&s;on to dread &s;pies and ambu&s;h in every thicket?&mdash;The &s;orrowful Babet again retired from the tower; and though in a few days after want and affection had overcome all his &s;cruples, and he was determined to come forth in &s;pite of every danger, the lovely form never again appeared to his view.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when he had no longer any means of &s;upporting his exi&s;tence, he re&s;olved in de&s;pair to
<PB N="208" REF="035693_0206_10064D5AD71B4498">
quit his retreat, and again throw him&s;elf into his &s;i&s;ter's arms, or expo&s;e him&s;elf to the daggers of his blood-thir&s;ty murderers. He had for this purpo&s;e fixed upon the day when the roots he had collected by moonlight were exhau&s;ted, and he had no longer any means of &s;upporting his wretch|ed exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>This, however, was the very day when our fugi|tives had been driven into the grotto by the wild rabble, who filled the garden, the grove, and the whole neighbourhood with their frantic &s;houts. Philip thought he was betrayed, that this careful &s;earch, this roar of the wild bea&s;ts for prey was directed again&s;t him. More than once, indeed, the tower had been &s;urrounded by the raging mob; the bolde&s;t of them ventured into the tower, and clambered over the mo&s;s-grown ruins. As the only acce&s;s to Philip's retreat was by a &s;mall opening, before which he had piled up the &s;tones in artful di&s;order, he e&s;caped their &s;earch.</P>
<P>As, however, nothing appeared more certain than that he was the object of their pur&s;uit, his fears were redoubled, and in the fir&s;t days which &s;ucceeded this incident, he did not even tru&s;t his life to the friendly darkne&s;s of night, but re&s;igned him&s;elf a prey to the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing hunger and thir&s;t, till he was almo&s;t too much reduced to be able to quit the place of his retreat&punc;</P>
<P>Meanwhile he &s;ometimes &s;aw his &s;i&s;ter in the neighbourhood of the tower, and rejoiced to &s;ee her &s;afe. Now, however, &s;he appeared to be attend|ed by two &s;trangers, who&s;e &s;u&s;picious pre&s;ence pre|vented him from di&s;covering him&s;elf, more e&s;pe|cially as the deep grief which Babet's features bore, gave him rea&s;on to apprehend that her atten|dants were no friends but guards.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t in the ob&s;curity of night he ventured out to allay his thir&s;t in a neighbouring pond, de&s;|pair
<PB N="209" REF="035693_0207_10064D5C6238D958">
drove him into the court of his father's hou&s;e; and had he found the door open, he would in &s;pite of all danger have penetrated to his &s;i&s;ter's cham|ber; but all was fa&s;t. Should he make a noi&s;e, &s;hould he knock at the door, mu&s;t he not meet the &s;u&s;picious &s;trangers whom he daily &s;aw wand|ering in the garden? Irre&s;olute he walked about till the fir&s;t cock-crow cha&s;ed him back to his ruins.</P>
<P>Yet longer to endure this accumulation of mi&s;|ery was beyond the &s;trength of a young man rear|ed in the lap of pro&s;perity, on whom every joy of life had &s;hed its gentle&s;t influence, and whom the winds of Heaven had never vi&s;ited too roughly, Want and de&s;pair unfolded that courage which&punc; effeminacy and profu&s;ion, had weakened: for all our virtues and vices are the offspring of natural or artificial wants. He had formed an irrevocable determination the en&s;uing night to force his way into his father's hou&s;e, and, if it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by murderers, to die in his &s;i&s;ter's arms. The tem|pe&s;t anticipated the execution of his de&s;ign, &s;prang open his dungeon, and accidentally threw him into the hands of friends.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tory which he communicated when refre&s;hment had recovered him from the fir&s;t &s;tupefaction of returning &s;en&s;ibility. The di&s;covery that William and Frederick were pri&s;oners of war in&s;pired him with confidence. Their blue coats, which he had hitherto mi&s;taken for the uniform of the national guard, he no longer viewed with ab|horrence, The&s;e men had fought for <HI>his</HI> rights; they were of <HI>his</HI> political faith, and could not betray him. When &s;imilar nece&s;&s;ities and &s;imilar principles form a point of union among men, the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious &s;ouls &s;oon cordially fraterni&s;e.</P>
<P>The clouds which had ob&s;cured Babet's mind
<PB N="210" REF="035693_0208_10064D5F0F167128">
now began to di&s;per&s;e. She felt that &s;he was alive, and appeared to be plea&s;ed at the feeling. William, who anxiou&s;ly ob&s;erved every change of her coun|tenance, now ventured more directly to pronounce the prophetic dream to be a delu&s;ion of the imagi|nation; and to refute his opinion, &s;he recapitula|ted the &s;tory of the apparition of her father, and the awful &s;ummons, with the minute&s;t circum|&s;tances. When &s;he led her friends to the window, to &s;how them the place at the gate where the &s;pec|tre had walked and &s;ighed, Frederick blu&s;hed, and &s;tammered out the confe&s;&s;ion, that he was the figure which had occa&s;ioned her &s;o much unea&s;i|ne&s;s, and he re&s;pectfully begged her forgivene&s;s for having &s;ighed &s;o loud.</P>
<P>Babet's joy at this di&s;covery &s;erved to conceal the ingenuous &s;hame which glowed in her cheeks, on hearing Frederick's confe&s;&s;ion. His romantic nocturnal excur&s;ion recalled to her mind the un|common eagerne&s;s with which, at the door of the hermitage, he had expre&s;&s;ed the wi&s;h that he might die with her. Inexperienced as &s;he was in the ten|der pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he yet would have &s;worn that this was love&mdash;and the ro&s;es on her cheeks changed into the deepe&s;t &s;carlet.</P>
<P>Philip, who had long known that pa&s;&s;ion, gue&s;&s;ed what pa&s;&s;ed in the heart of the &s;tranger. The conque&s;t his &s;i&s;ter had made &s;eemed to give him plea&s;ure, as in his own de&s;titute and un&s;ettled &s;ituation he was unable to afford her protection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and he rejoiced at the pro&s;pect of her honor being &s;ecured, in a union with a man of worth. That the mode&s;t, backward Frederick was no &s;educer his own experience convinced him, for at the fir&s;t glance he di&s;covered a man unhackneyed in the ways of vice. The &s;ame evening, too, William completely removed every doubt, by availing him|&s;elf of a favourable opportunity to acquaint him with the pure and honorable pa&s;&s;ion of his friend.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="035693_0209_10064D62598F80B8">"Is he a nobleman?" was the only que&s;tion which the prejudices of this Frenchman of the old &s;chool &s;ugge&s;ted; and when William, by an eva&s;ion, had &s;atisfied him upon that &s;ubject, he joyfully gave his con&s;ent to the propo&s;al, that, as &s;oon as an ex|change of pri&s;oners took place, Babet &s;hould ac|company Frederick as his bride.</P>
<P>The ba&s;hful lover meanwhile had remained alone with the object of his wi&s;hes, but his courage had cea&s;ed with the tempe&s;t. He allowed the favora|ble opportunity of completing in the evening what he had begun in the morning, to e&s;cape. They both &s;at in profound &s;ilence&mdash;both fixed their eyes on the ground&mdash;Frederick becau&s;e he had already &s;aid too much, and Babet becau&s;e &s;he had heard too much to remain longer doubtful of the &s;ituation of his heart.</P>
<P>In the delightful feeling of having e&s;caped the dangers by which they were threatened, the little party &s;pent, in friendly confidence and harmony, the remainder of a day which had begun with &s;uch unfavorable au&s;pices. They now began to con&s;ult what was to be done with Philip. Babet in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould take refuge in the inacce&s;&s;ible ca|vern till the republican tempe&s;t had &s;pent its fury. Even Philip him&s;elf was at fir&s;t inclined to this propo&s;al. When he was informed, however, of the trea&s;ure which had been found, and &s;aw the ca&s;ket full of diamonds, with the value of which he ac|quainted the inexperienced company, he &s;uddenly changed his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>He was too generous, indeed, or rather too thoughtle&s;s, notwith&s;tanding Babet's entreaties, to take more than a &s;mall proportion of his father's beque&s;t. He would not, as he &s;aid, dimini&s;h the little dowry of his &s;i&s;ter, as the three rings which he appropriated to him&s;elf were fully &s;ufficient to carry him out of the territories of France. He
<PB N="212" REF="035693_0210_10064D63E4F37CE8">
then propo&s;ed to equip him&s;elf in a manner &s;uitable to his rank, ha&s;ten to the army of the Prince of Conde, and never again &s;et his foot on the &s;oil of his ungrateful country, till he came back to reclaim his paternal inheritance with armed hand. "Thy &s;ate, my dear Babet," &s;aid he with a &s;ignificant &s;mile, "I commit to the&s;e brave men. They are noblemen, they are &s;oldiers, and I rely upon them with confidence. To them I transfer the father's authority and the brother's duties, which fortune now denies me an opportunity to exerci&s;e. Under their protection leave this de&s;olate man&s;ion, as &s;oon as they invite you to fly to a more &s;afe and agreea|ble retreat."</P>
<P>In vain Babet laboured to prevail upon him to prefer the &s;ecurity of the cavern to an un&s;afe flight; in vain &s;he offered, &s;ince he was not to be diverted from his re&s;olution, to accompany him and &s;hare every danger. He urged &s;o many plau&s;ible and powerful rea&s;ons again&s;t this propo&s;al, and William, although he did not altogether approve the thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s with which the Chevalier entru&s;ted the happine&s;s of his &s;i&s;ter in the hands of men whom he had never before &s;een, &s;upported him &s;o ably, that Babet was at la&s;t obliged to yield.</P>
<P>The old &s;ervant procured his young ma&s;ter the dre&s;s of a pea&s;ant. They cut off his hair, changed his fair complexion into a &s;un-burnt olive, and equip|ped in large wooden &s;hoes, accompanied by the faithful old footman, who knew every bye road and footpath: the incon&s;iderate youth at midnight took leave of his weeping &s;i&s;ter. He fir&s;t took the road to Montauban, where he expected the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a &s;teady friend to enable him to proceed on his journey.</P>
<P>After his departure, the little &s;ociety he had left behind lived more than a month in great concord and tranquility. Frederick enjoyed many delight|ful
<PB N="213" REF="035693_0211_10064D65DC2A6748">
hours, but it was only in &s;eeing his beloved; for as often as William either &s;eriou&s;ly or with raillery reproached him with his timidity, and often as he him&s;elf formed the heroic re&s;olution this day to open his heart, and to entreat from Babet's lips the deci&s;ion of his fate, yet he continued to return at night to town as undecided as he had come, and communicated only to the trees the &s;ecret which he ought to have confided to the ear of his mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;We can indeed offer but one apology for this conduct. Babet carefully avoided being alone with him, and a declaration of love, even in pre&s;ence of the be&s;t friend, is, God knows why, a very unplea&s;ant ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Matters, however, could not long remain in this &s;tate. It was improper that a young lady of &s;ix|teen &s;hould receive daily vi&s;its from two young officers. In the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the country, indeed, nobody paid any attention to their conduct, and the new marriage code ju&s;tified many things which formerly would have attracted cen&s;ure. But Ba|bet her&s;elf felt the doubtful nature of her &s;ituation, her tender &s;en&s;ibility revolted at it, and her help|le&s;&s;ne&s;s alone led her to &s;uppre&s;s the dictates of her trembling delicacy. To this likewi&s;e was ad|ded, the general report of a &s;peedy exchange of pri&s;oners, an event which might daily take place. A &s;udden departure then mu&s;t render the favora|ble i&s;&s;ue of Frederick's declaration &s;till more doubt|ful; for experience tells us, that it is ea&s;ier to ob|tain a lady's con&s;ent, when there is the pro&s;pect of a long court&s;hip, and when &s;he has time to think of her new &s;ituation. Precipitation might ruin all.</P>
<P>This and much more did William daily urge to his ba&s;hful friend; nor was Frederick in&s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tice of his remon&s;trances, but he wanted courage to obey his own conviction. One day, as they were walking &s;lowly home in the du&s;k of the evening, William bethought him&s;elf of endea|voring
<PB N="214" REF="035693_0212_10064D693643D498">
to give new effect to his &s;olicitations, by &s;ugge&s;ting &s;omething, the mere po&s;&s;ibility of which is &s;ufficient to drive a lover to de&s;pair. "What," &s;aid he, "if by your procra&s;tination the cha&s;tity and innocence of your mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould be expo&s;ed to dan|ger? What, if a horde of frantic per&s;ons, hurried on by &s;ome criminal ebullition&mdash;a circum&s;tance indeed which cannot be fore&s;een, but which, in the pre&s;ent frenzy of the people, may always be apprehended&mdash; &s;hould again bur&s;t into Babet's hou&s;e? The fir&s;t time, the gha&s;tly &s;ight of her father's corp&s;e allayed their fury, but what now will protect her from their brutal outrage?"</P>
<P>Frederick &s;topped, &s;tared wildly around and trembled.</P>
<P>"Who," proceeded William, "who will an&s;wer that even now, while we are walking quietly here"&mdash;</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake, no more!" cried Frederick with trembling lips, "you have &s;ucceeded, here is my hand.&mdash;Sure as the&s;e planets revolve over our heads&mdash;&s;ure as a God is enthroned above the&s;e planets, to-morrow &s;hall I tell her all!"</P>
<P>William received the hand and promi&s;e of his friend. In order to facilitate this bold attempt, he re&s;olved to remain at home next day, under pre|tence of indi&s;po&s;ition. Frederick hurried on be|fore him, immer&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in thought. He imagined him&s;elf at the feet of his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ought words to expre&s;s his pa&s;&s;ion, and found that either Babet's language <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, or he had made but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the French tongue.</P>

<P>An officer of the national guard, who was by trade a butcher, told him roughly, that the number of pri&s;oners of war in this little town was by far too great; that &s;ymptoms of di&s;order had been ob|&s;erved, and the municipality had therefore thought proper to transfer the half of their gue&s;ts to the next department. Lieutenant Perl&s;tadt was a|mong the latter, and therefore he would be &s;o good as to follow him immediately.</P>
<P>Frederick was confounded. William collected him&s;elf, and expre&s;&s;ed a hope that at lea&s;t they would not &s;eparate him from his friend, but &s;end them together to the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>"To &s;eparate &s;uch friend&s;hip," pur&s;ued the officer bluntly, "is the very object the municipali|ty have in view." He begged them to make ha&s;te, as he had many other pri&s;oners to call out of their beds. "On account of the temper of the peo|ple," added he, "who hate all foreigners, you may con&s;ider your&s;elves indebted to the magi&s;|trates for giving orders that you &s;hould be &s;ent out of the town by night."</P>
<P>William ea&s;ily &s;aw that all kind of oppo&s;ition would here be fruitle&s;s, Frederick was too much &s;tupefied by the order to be able to make any pre|paration for his departure. William packed up the few nece&s;&s;aries which belonged to his friend, and whi&s;pered in his ear: "Be ea&s;y! I will &s;peak to Babet to-morrow upon your affair."</P>
<P>Frederick embraced William, and took leave in &s;ilence.&mdash;Silently he walked along the &s;treets, &s;ur|rounded by grenadiers.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. THE FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THE lovely mourner did not hear with perfect indifference of the departure of her lover. Be&s;ides that a young man who dotes upon a woman with his whole &s;oul mu&s;t ever have a claim to &s;ome con&s;ideration, even with the mo&s;t inflexible beauty, Babet really felt a cordial regard for Fred|erick; and who knows how far this feeling which &s;he indulged without di&s;tru&s;t might have carried her, had not William's pre&s;ence, uncon&s;ciou&s;ly to both of them, extingui&s;hed every &s;ofter emotion of his friend?</P>
<P>The &s;orrow &s;he felt at Frederick's departure was rather &s;ympathy with William's grief; nay, we mu&s;t confe&s;s that this feeling was in&s;tantly blended with a &s;en&s;ation of &s;ecret joy, becau&s;e in future &s;he &s;hould enjoy William's company without the con|&s;traint which the penetrating eye of a lover impo&s;ed. Yet let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed that her mind di&s;tinctly avow|ed this thought. No; it was only an ob&s;cure feel|ing which &s;he never properly explained to her&s;elf, and which, perhaps, &s;he did not exactly under|&s;tand.</P>
<P>With the mo&s;t childi&s;h unembarra&s;&s;ment &s;he laid her hand in his during their walks, or &s;he clung to him when the cold harve&s;t wind ru&s;tled through the trees; or &s;he would allow him to carry her over a ditch; or eagerly &s;natched the gla&s;s from his hand when he was over-heated, and was about to &s;wallow a ha&s;ty draught.&mdash;In a word, &s;he gave
<PB N="217" REF="035693_0215_10064D6F608F1D10">
him involuntarily &s;o many proofs of her innocent attachment, and the &s;parks of love diffu&s;ed &s;o many new charms over her enchanting form, that it re|quired the infinite affection he bore Jeanette, and the pure friend&s;hip he entertained for Frederick, to enable him to avoid the dangerous influence of a pa&s;&s;ion, which it would have been criminal to indulge.</P>
<P>Never, perhaps, had his con&s;tancy &s;u&s;tained a &s;everer trial. Better acquainted than Babet with the wandering of the human heart, he ventured to examine the &s;tate of his feelings; he could not but perceive that the beauty and innocence of this maid powerfully intere&s;ted him, he trembled when he contemplated the precipice on which he &s;tood, and re&s;olved, the better to avoid the danger, to ha&s;ten the di&s;covery which he had promi&s;ed to communicate of his friend's attachment.</P>
<P>He was not deterred from the performance of his promi&s;e by ob&s;erving that Babet avoided all conver&s;ation upon this &s;ubject; that &s;he endeavor|ed to interrupt what &s;he could not altogether &s;hun. He declared to her with warmth and importunity, that it was in her power to make his friend happy, and at the &s;ame time to confer the greate&s;t happi|ne&s;s upon him&s;elf. Babet had but one an&s;wer to all that William urged &s;o eloquently in favor of the ab&s;ent lover.</P>
<P>"But do I love him?" &s;aid &s;he blu&s;hing, while &s;he peeped through the veil over her long &s;ilken eye-la&s;hes. "But do I love him?" repeated &s;he with glowing cheeks, as &s;he darted a glance at the more fortunate advocate, which told him what he dur&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e. In a word, the &s;uitor was obliged to content him&s;elf with the equivocal an&s;wer: that &s;he would leave her re&s;olution to be formed by time, that &s;he would not &s;tudiou&s;ly re&s;i&s;t his

wi&s;hes, but would candidly acknowledge whenever &s;he began to feel any thing more for Frederick than e&s;teem."</P>
<P>His ab&s;ence, while William was daily with her, was not very well calculated indeed to effect &s;o fa|vourable an alteration. And why then did not William mode&s;tly decline his vi&s;its, when he but too di&s;tinctly perceived that his intercour&s;e with Babet would be fatal to his friend?&mdash;Two &s;ophi&s;ti|cal rea&s;ons, backed by vanity, prevented this nece&s;|&s;ary &s;tep. "She is quite alone," thought &s;he, "&s;he has no protector but me. I cannot venture to aban|don the young helple&s;s orphan to chance. And be&s;ides, the intere&s;t of my friend! Mu&s;t I not ra|ther redouble my vi&s;its, to talk to her daily of his accompli&s;hments, and thus by degrees animate her heart to love?"</P>
<P>Alas! all this might have perfectly &s;ucceeded, had he only appri&s;ed her of the &s;ecret that he was married; that he was united to an amiable wife, and was now perhaps a father. But we mu&s;t here confe&s;s a weakne&s;s in our hero&mdash;a weakne&s;s which he had in common with three-fourths of his &s;ex Although unque&s;tionably he laid no claim to Ba|bet's love, yet he &s;ecretly felt him&s;elf &s;o flattered by it, that &s;uch a di&s;covery daily became more un|plea&s;ant. Often the deci&s;ive word hovered upon his lips; but one of Babet's ingenious glances again overthrew his re&s;olution; and though he did not u&s;e the &s;malle&s;t effort to cheri&s;h the flame, it was high trea&s;on to friend&s;hip and to love not to extin|gui&s;h it. Far be it from us, therefore, to attempt to ju&s;tify our hero's foible, who, in this in&s;tance, allowed him&s;elf to be governed by his vanity.</P>

<P><PB N="219" REF="035693_0217_10064D752B8305D8">One evening when he entered his apartment in profound meditation, he found a letter from Jeanette lying upon the table. He blu&s;hed, pre&s;&s;ed the well known characters to his lips, and ha&s;tily broke the &s;eal. She informed him of her happy delivery, de&s;cribed the beauty of the lovely boy, her mater|nal tran&s;ports, her anxiety to &s;ee the beloved father. All was tenderne&s;s and love. Not a trace of jea|lou&s;y was to be found in the whole letter; every line di&s;covered the fonde&s;t confidence, which re|jected the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of the po&s;&s;ibility of infidelity. Ha! this genero&s;ity touched him to the quick. A tear &s;tarted in his eye; he rai&s;ed his eyes, and &s;ecretly &s;wore to God and his con&s;cience to appear before Babet next day with this letter in his hand.</P>
<P>And indeed this time he would have kept his word, but the caprice of fortune was not yet weary of embittering his cup of life. In th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> morning William awoke in a &s;trong fever, which had been occa&s;ioned by a cold he had caught in coming home one wet harve&s;t evening. At fir&s;t he paid no at|tention to it. He attempted to ri&s;e and put on his clothes, but &s;carcely had he left his bed, when the fever attacked him more violently. One &s;hivering fit &s;ucceeded another, and again compelled him to return to bed.</P>
<P>There was but one phy&s;ician in the town, who combined with William's impatience to increa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition. On the fifth day he felt his &s;trength &s;o impaired by a profu&s;ion of drugs, that he began to fear he &s;hould never more revi&s;it his native land.</P>
<P>When Babet had for &s;omedays expected in vain a vi&s;it from her friend, &s;he &s;ent a pea&s;ant boy to the town to inquire after him. The news of the danger in which the man &s;he &s;ecretly loved was placed, plung|ed her into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able anxiety.

times &s;he was on the point of flying to his bed &s;ide, and an hundred times her female mode&s;ty with|held her. She now felt, and for the fir&s;t time ac|knowledged to her&s;elf, how much &s;he was attached to William. She now &s;aw that it was on his ac|count that life had acquired new charms. Two or three times a day &s;he &s;ent the boy to town to bring her tidings of his health. The impatience with which &s;he expected his return, the inqui&s;itive anx|iety with which &s;he ran to meet him, indubitably te&s;tified the warmth of her attachment.</P>
<P>William's illne&s;s, though not dangerous, was very lingering. It left a languor and debility be|hind, which prevented him from going abroad. In a few weeks he again walked through the room, but he could not mount the &s;tair, and dur&s;t not ven|ture to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the bleak autumn winds. He always &s;ent, however, the mo&s;t flattering ac|counts to his anxious friend, and was &s;o accu&s;tom|ed to the appearance of the little me&s;&s;enger, that at the hour when the latter u&s;ed to arrive he &s;tood at the window, and expected him with impatience.</P>
<P>All at once the boy failed to come at the u&s;ual hour. He came not in the morning; he did not appear in the evening. This &s;urpri&s;ed William the fir&s;t day; the &s;econd it gave him unea&s;ine&s;s; the third his anxiety was extremely painful; and on the fourth he could no longer endure the tor|tures of &s;u&s;pence. He threw on his great-coat, &s;upported him&s;elf on a crutch, and &s;lowly bent his way along the well-known road.</P>
<P>When he &s;aw at a di&s;tance Babet's habitation, his heart beat; but he carried his tali&s;man, Jean|ette's letter, in his bo&s;om, and it was the anxiety of friend&s;hip alone which cau&s;ed his agitation. Ex|pectation redoubled his &s;trength and his &s;peed. He entered the gate with inqui&s;itive looks; he went through the de&s;olate court; he a&s;cended the &s;tair,
<PB N="221" REF="035693_0219_10064D7863289088">
found all the doors open, and all the apartments empty. Not a trace was to be &s;een of Babet or her &s;ervant; not a &s;ound announced the pre&s;ence of a human being.</P>
<P>"Perhaps," thought he, "&s;ome new tumult has compelled her to take refuge in the cavern." He endeavoured to grope his way in the dark down to the dungeon, and to find the place where the en|trance of the cavern was guarded by loo&s;e &s;tones. He found it, and whi&s;pered &s;oftly&mdash;then louder and louder: "Babet! It is I! it is your friend!"&mdash; In vain, all was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Perhaps," did hope again &s;ugge&s;t, "&s;olitude has renewed her enthu&s;ia&s;tic turn. Perhaps I &s;hall find her in the grotto."&mdash;With much difficulty he &s;ucceeded in finding his way back through th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dark winding pa&s;&s;ages. He went to the garden, traver&s;ed the grove through the leafle&s;s trees, went &s;oftly over the bridge, &s;tood before the door of the grotto, and &s;aw nothing but the picture of de&s;olation.</P>
<P>"My God," exclaimed he, "what can have be|come of the helple&s;s creature?"&mdash;With exhau&s;ted &s;trength he pryed round the whole neighbourhood, vi&s;ited the hermitage, &s;earched the ruins of the tower, through which he clambered, calling every where the name of Babet&mdash;but in vain.</P>
<P>One time the murmur of the &s;tream deceived his ear; again the buz of a gra&s;hopper in the neigh|bouring thicket. Still he hoped to cla&s;p Babet; but his hopes deceived him, and every moment his &s;trength decrea&s;ed. At la&s;t he &s;unk down exhau&s;t|ed under the lime tree on the lawn, and fell into a kind of uncon&s;cious &s;tupor. "Is there then no compa&s;&s;ionate mortal at hand, who can give me &s;ome intelligence of her?&mdash;Would I could but &s;ee the little me&s;&s;enger?"&mdash;In vain; his vows were un|heard, and the approaching night obliged him at

la&s;t to think of returning home without being able to form one probable conjecture re&s;pecting Babet, to cheer him on his &s;olitary way.</P>
<P>Di&s;tracted by gloomy pre&s;ages, tortured by the thought of the de&s;pair into which his friend would be plunged by the intelligence, he proceeded on to the town in &s;orrowful plight, his head reclining on his brea&s;t, when he met a pea&s;ant boy chanting merrily, "<HI>Allons, erfans de la patrie!</HI>" The &s;ound rou&s;ed him from his reverie. He looked up&mdash;it was the little me&s;&s;enger. "Ha!" cried he ha&s;tily, "what has become of the lady, who for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t &s;ent you daily to inquire for me?"</P>
<P>"The lady?" &s;aid the boy carele&s;sly, "I don't know. Three days ago &s;he engaged me to come to her, as u&s;ual, the following day. When I went, however, &s;he was gone; I found nobody at all in the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>The boy could tell him nothing more. Tired of importunate que&s;tions, he took off his hat, again began to &s;ing, and went his way.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. THE CONFLAGRATION.</HEAD>
<P>BABET's &s;udden elopement made &s;o violent an impre&s;&s;ion upon William, that his illne&s;s be|came more &s;erious than ever, and he would not perhaps have e&s;caped a dangerous relap&s;e, if he had lei&s;ure to dwell upon his &s;ituation, and had followed the advice of his phy&s;ician, who ordered
<PB N="223" REF="035693_0221_10064D7DF3035768">
him to keep his bed; for nothing, perhaps, tends more to confirm &s;ickne&s;s than &s;uch a regimen. He now forgot his own health, and made ince&s;&s;ant in|quiries after Babet in all the neighbouring country; traver&s;ed every road, and &s;earched avery village, to di&s;cover &s;ome traces of her. Thus the fre&s;h air and exerci&s;e &s;uper&s;eded the phy&s;ician, and com|pletely cured the patient without farther pre&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>His con&s;cience now became unea&s;y, and &s;marted &s;everely at the lea&s;t touch. To the blame which he ju&s;tly had incurred, his ingenuous &s;en&s;ibility add|ed a new charge, which preyed upon him no le&s;s acutely. When after long inquiry and reflection William could di&s;cover no other rea&s;on for Babet's my&s;terious flight, vanity at la&s;t whi&s;pered him, that &s;he had fled from him to &s;eek that cure from the &s;oothing hand of time, which his coldne&s;s had ap|pri&s;ed her that &s;he could not expect from love.</P>
<P>Alas! had he but told her &s;ooner that he was married, this would never have happened. If a traveller ignorant of his way comes to a thick gloomy wood, and finds an high road, he proceeds with caution; even a foot-path may induce him to go on; but if there is neither beaten track nor path-way, he returns. So is it with the labyrinth of Love, in which Cupid's bye roads abound, but through which, too, the great high road of Hymen leads. If the latter is &s;hut, &s;ome Werter &s;eeks a forbidden path; a virtuous maid turns quick and flies, however &s;weetly Love's groves and nightin|gales may entice.&mdash;Babet would have overcome her pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he now had been the bride of his friend, had not childi&s;h vanity&mdash;Alas! how he blu&s;hed for his weakne&s;s!&mdash;and be a&s;&s;ured, the wor&s;t kind of &s;hame is that which &s;urpri&s;es us when there is none to witne&s;s its effects.</P>
<P>Where now was he to inquire for Babet?&mdash;
<PB N="224" REF="035693_0222_10064D7F826B6A50">
Where obtain intelligence of her?&mdash;It was danger|ous to inquire after her with too much anxiety. The &s;teps of the pri&s;oners were watched with jea|lou&s;y; their conver&s;ation and their conduct were marked. Babet's family was obnoxious; the warm intere&s;t he expre&s;&s;ed for her might excite &s;u&s;picion of a &s;ecret connection, and at this time a &s;ecret connection was always con&s;idered a con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>He dur&s;t venture, therefore, only to put indirect que&s;tions, or endeavor by &s;ome artifice to di&s;cover what he &s;ought; but the un&s;atisfactory an&s;wers which he thus obtained, afforded him no light in his darkne&s;s. He at la&s;t was &s;ilent, and expected from accident a clue to the my&s;tery.</P>
<P>In order, if po&s;&s;ible, to put him&s;elf in the way of &s;uch a di&s;covery, he wandered about from morn|ing till night through all the villages in the neigh|bourhood, and failed not from time to time to vi&s;it Babet's habitation, which he &s;till found de&s;olate and forlorn.</P>
<P>One evening he wandered weary with his &s;earch through a village, returning cheerle&s;s home with &s;till renewed di&s;appointment. Scarcely had he got through the village, when &s;uddenly he heard a cry of Fire! He looked back, and &s;aw a cottage in flames, which &s;pread &s;o rapidly, that before William could reach the &s;pot, the neighbouring hou&s;es were in a blaze. The inhabitants flocked together from all quarters; every thing that could be re&s;cued from the flames was &s;aved, and William vigorou&s;ly con|tributed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to carry off whatever he could reach. Sometimes he bore a che&s;t upon his &s;houl|ders, which anxiety alone enabled him to carry; now he tottered under heavy bundles of linen; and again, to recover him&s;elf, &s;tood at the well to &s;up|ply water. The flames continued to rage, the fire gained ground, tho&s;e who endeavoured to extin|gui&s;h it &s;houted, the unfortunate proprietors la|mented their fate, and the fire bell rang.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="035693_0223_10064D8136293818">A piercing cry &s;uddenly bur&s;t through the dread|ful noi&s;e, and &s;truck William's ear. He made his way to the place from which the voice of woe pro|ceeded, and &s;aw a young woman rolling her&s;elf on the ground in the agonies of de&s;pair. She had been in the fields at work when the fire broke out; &s;he ran breathle&s;s to the &s;pot, and found her cottage in flames. She had left a &s;ucking infant in the cradle, and a boy of eight years old to watch his little &s;i&s;ter. Neither of them was any where to be found; the flames prevented all acce&s;s to the cottage, and the roof every moment threatened to fall in.</P>
<P>The woman lay on the ground, tearing her hair, and uttering &s;uch bitter cries as cut the hearts of the by-&s;tanders. "My children! my children!&mdash; My Antony! my little Babet!"&mdash;William could not &s;u&s;tain this cruel &s;pectacle. Without con&s;id|eration&mdash;for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lle&s;t reflection would, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, have deterred him from the ra&s;h deed&mdash;he plunged into the flames.</P>
<P>The &s;pectators &s;huddered&mdash;the mother rai&s;ed her&s;elf on her knees, and &s;tretched her hands to heaven in the attitude of prayer. She could not &s;peak&mdash;&s;he only cried, and God heard her cries!&mdash; With the &s;creaming boy in one hand, and the &s;leep|ing babe in the other, their deliverer returned in half a minute, and, almo&s;t &s;uffocated with du&s;t and &s;moke, dropped &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the feet of the weeping mother.</P>
<P>Her joy expre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf in the wilde&s;t tran&s;ports. She pre&s;&s;ed the children warmly to her brea&s;t&mdash; laughed, wept, and prayed&mdash;crept to William, ki&s;&s;ed his feet, bathed him in tears, ble&s;&s;ed him!&mdash; Then &s;he rai&s;ed the little &s;uckling to Heaven, and ordered the boy to fold his hands, and pray for his benefactor. The old men &s;tood round&mdash;tears hung on their grey eye-la&s;hes; they pulled off their caps

when William again opened his eyes, and gazed at him with re&s;pect as a &s;uperior being.</P>
<P>The flames were at la&s;t extingui&s;hed; no lives were lo&s;t; William was the only per&s;on who had &s;u&s;tained much injury, and lay unable to crawl home. "Generous &s;tranger," &s;aid the woman, "willingly would I carry you to my cottage, but I have none to offer you!"&mdash;"Come to mine, come to mine," cried an hundred voices. They con|tended for the honor of entertaining the &s;tranger, who had &s;o magnanimou&s;ly ri&s;ked his life. An old man at la&s;t obtained the preference, becau&s;e his hou&s;e was neare&s;t. William was removed to it with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, and every thing was provided that could contribute to remove the pain, or conduce to his refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>The grateful woman watched all the fir&s;t night be&s;ide him. She &s;at with the babe at her brea&s;t by his bed-&s;ide, and offered &s;ecret prayers to Heaven for his recovery. They had applied to his wound a &s;alve compo&s;ed of olive oil and &s;weet cream, mix|ed with &s;ome white lead, a remedy which &s;o great|ly a&s;&s;uaged the pain, that about midnight he fell a&s;leep, and next morning when the day was well advanced he awoke, greatly &s;trengthened and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|fre&s;hed.</P>

She held out to him the little Babet, as if &s;he would have &s;aid: "See there that lovely innocent; to thee &s;he owes her life!" The dear name of Babet awakened in his mind a train of agreeable ideas, which perhaps ye&s;terday, when the mother expre&s;&s;ed her agoni&s;ing grief, had uncon&s;ciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted to compel him to the ra&s;h attempt. He now learned that the hu&s;band and

<P>William was &s;o unweariedly tended with the mo&s;t anxious care, that in a few days he was in a &s;ituation to quit the hou&s;e of his benevolent ho&s;t. He was followed with ble&s;&s;ings from every quar|ter. The young woman accompanied him out of the village; and when he was about to leave her, &s;he attempted to ki&s;s his hand. She entreated him with tears not to forget her, but as often as his walks were in this direction to call at her hou&s;e, and ta&s;te the joys of the noble action he had per|formed.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed to vi&s;it her again, &s;hook her hearti|ly by the hand, and, accompanied by the delightful feeling of having been the benefactor of an hone&s;t family, which he con&s;idered r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> enough, he walked light and cheerily home.</P>

<P>WHILE all this was pa&s;&s;ing upon the agitated theatre of French liberty, Nature had &s;et free a little captive, who had long been expected with anxiety. Jeanette was delivered of a boy&mdash; lovely as a May-day would I &s;ay, were all May|days

<P>Poor Jeanette's joy at the birth of her boy was greatly embittered by the intelligence of William's captivity. It was &s;ome con&s;olation to her, indeed, that his life was no longer expo&s;ed to the &s;words and bullets of the enemy, and that &s;he might now hear or read of battles without trembling.

<P>Jeanette made every arrangement which mater|nal anxiety could &s;ugge&s;t for the mo&s;t careful treat|ment of her child. She committed him to the &s;u|perintendance of a clergyman's widow, who was her friend and neighbor. She left him in the hands of a nur&s;e, an hone&s;t country woman who loved the boy as her own child. The moment of &s;eparation was dreadful, but &s;he tore her&s;elf away, and obeyed the dictates of the mo&s;t &s;acred duty.

Hitherto a guardian angel &s;eemed to have guided her &s;teps, but no difficulties increa&s;ed upon her which it was difficult for an helple&s;s woman to &s;urmount. She remained &s;ev|eral weeks in Paris before &s;he could learn to whom &s;he ought to apply for a pa&s;&s;port, to carry her &s;afe through the interior of France. She was &s;ent from one office to another, and no where was &s;he treat|ed with the re&s;pect due to her &s;ex. Here a taylor gave him&s;elf airs, there &s;he was expo&s;ed to the vul|gar je&s;ts of a peruke-maker, dre&s;&s;ed out with the tri-coloured cockade; here &s;he was hooted by a &s;ecretary, and there impo&s;ed upon by a clerk. Tho&s;e who treated her be&s;t, advi&s;ed her not to ex|cite &s;u&s;picion by too much importunity, and bade her be patient till to-morrow.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="035693_0228_10064D8D080EBA98">Judge of the &s;ituation of a poor helple&s;s woman, who alone in the mid&s;t of this huge Golgotha un|acquainted with the dangers by which &s;he was &s;ur|rounded, trod every moment on the brink of a pre|cipice, knew nothing of the forms it was nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, and among a million of pretended phil|anthropi&s;ts, could not find a &s;ingle good man, who &s;howed a real principle of humanity and friend&s;hip. Think of the mi&s;ery of a woman who longed, with the mo&s;t glowing impatience, to be again united to her hu&s;band; who every morning left her lodgings with renewed hopes that now &s;he &s;hould attain the object and reward of her fond per&s;everence, when &s;he returned home again in the evening weary and forlorn. Thus did &s;everal weeks elap&s;e, and the &s;ickne&s;s of hope di&s;appointed, began at length to give place to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>One morning, when &s;he had wandered from &s;treet to &s;treet, and from office to office, and had every where in vain &s;ought humanity under the red cap, exhau&s;ted with fatigue, &s;he lo&s;t her&s;elf in the garden of the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> &s;unk down upon a bench, and, without regarding the company pa&s;&s;ing by, bitterly wept her fate. Many &s;topped and gazed at her a moment. Many, accu&s;tomed to the daily &s;pectacle of mi&s;ery, pa&s;&s;ed carele&s;&s;ly along. Nobody a&s;ked, "Poor woman, what is the matter with you?"</P>
<P>A beautiful woman, elegantly dre&s;&s;ed in the Gre|cian &s;tyle, now came down one of the walks. Jea|nette did not ob&s;erve her. The lady ob&s;erved Jea|nette with &s;ympathy, did not &s;top indeed, but fre|quently looked back. After pa&s;&s;ing on a little &s;he returned, repa&s;&s;ed the mourner, and whi&s;pered&punc; "Do not weep, my child! To &s;hed tears is a crime here!"</P>
<P>Jeanette looked up.&mdash;Scarce had &s;he time to ob|&s;erve the benignant profile of the lovely &s;tranger;
<PB N="231" REF="035693_0229_10064D8FE2E3DE98">
but the features were &s;o blended with humanity and kindne&s;s, that they in&s;tantly in&s;pired the poor outca&s;t with confidence. She &s;tarted up, followed the lady, and eagerly exclaimed: "Ah! madam, pity a poor helple&s;s &s;tranger!"</P>
<P>The angelic creature turned timorou&s;ly round, and &s;aid eagerly: "Not here! not here!&mdash;Come in the evening to the <HI>Rue St. Hanor&eacute;,</HI> and inquire at number 27, for <HI>There&s;a Cabarrus.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent Madame Tall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on.</NOTE></P>
<P>She di&s;appeared, but her words remained deep in Jeanette's memory. With impatience &s;he ex|pected the evening; hope lent her wings; with &s;erene confidence &s;he appeared before the amiable There&s;a.</P>
<P>"Forgive me, Madam," &s;aid the gentle creature, "forgive me for &s;eeming this morning to treat you with har&s;hne&s;s; but you know not how dangerous it is in this place to &s;how compa&s;&s;ion for the unfor|tunate.

I have a little influ|ence. Speak freely."</P>
<P>Alas! &s;uch accents! &s;uch kind attentive good|ne&s;s were now &s;trange to Jeanette's ear and heart. She bur&s;t into tears, but they were tears of melan|choly plea&s;ure. The artle&s;s narrative of her &s;im|ple tale affected There&s;a. She detained the amia|ble wife, to whom &s;he felt her&s;elf attracted, to &s;up|per, and &s;et down to write a note. She then en|tertained her gue&s;t with the mo&s;t uncon&s;trained cheerfulne&s;s, and carefully avoided touching upon any chord which did not found in uni&s;on with in|nocent gaiety.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. THE MAYOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE happy pilgrim breathed &s;ilent ble&s;&s;ings over her guardian angel when &s;he &s;aw the barrier of Paris &s;hut behind her. Engro&s;&s;ed with delightful contemplations &s;he lolled in the corner of her chai&s;e. The mo&s;t enchanting land&s;capes pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed. She never &s;topped at any &s;tage. Twenty times a day indeed was Jeanette obliged to &s;how her pa&s;&s;port; but it was immediately returned to her with &s;ulky looks, becau&s;e the mo&s;t dexterous inqui&s;itor could find no error in it.</P>
<P>The anxious wife, ha&s;tening to her beloved hu&s;|band, allowed her&s;elf neither repo&s;e nor refre&s;h|ment; the third day had dawned, when a re&s;tle&s;s &s;lumber overpowered her for a few moments. A large town now pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their view, where &s;he re&s;olved to &s;top till next morning, to recruit her exhau&s;ted &s;trength.</P>
<P>As &s;he entered the gate &s;he heard a noi&s;e in the neighboring &s;treets, to which at fir&s;t &s;he paid no attention. When &s;he came near the market-place, however, &s;he &s;aw an immen&s;e crowd of people, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">locked together from all quarters. She was now
<PB N="233" REF="035693_0231_10064D938EBA10B8">
alarmed; for all &s;he had read and heard of the wild ebullitions of popular fury &s;uddenly recur|red to her mind.</P>
<P>Alas! in a luckle&s;s hour &s;he had entered within the walls of the town. It would be &s;uper&s;luous to relate how the tumult aro&s;e. The people re&s;em|ble the &s;and in the de&s;art, which at fir&s;t whirled round by the gentle breeze in little volumes, is by degrees agitated deeper and deeper, till it &s;wells into a &s;weeping torrent which overwhelms every thing it meets, tears the trees up by the roots, and buries men and hou&s;es in de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Some Jacobin had been preaching up the plun|dering &s;y&s;tem of an equal divi&s;ion of property, and collected the journeymen, and porters, and &s;er|vants, by the force of their arms to carry it into effect. The enfuriated people a&s;&s;embled in crowds to murder a &s;ource of rich people, and &s;hare their inheritance under the banner of liberty.</P>
<P>When Jeanette entered the town, the people were entertaining them&s;elves with that &s;pectacle with which they had &s;o often been glutted &s;ince the 9th Thermidor, that of bloody heads carried in proce&s;&s;ion upon pikes. The carriage was &s;ud|denly caught in the crowd, and could move neither backward nor forward. Jeanette trembled and grew pale when &s;he perceived the frantic rabble, who, in&s;tead of the former images of &s;aints and con&s;ecrated banners, carried in triumph the bloody en&s;igns of human heads which they had cut off.</P>
<P>Peter &s;at on the coach-box, and gazed with open mouth and looks of horror. The lofty box made the poor fellow, again&s;t his will, a prominent ob|ject. When the &s;anguinary rout came up, one of the &s;tandard-bearers thought proper to practi&s;e the cruel je&s;t of clapping the goary head to Peter's no&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted on his ki&s;&s;ing it. As Peter did not under&s;tand a word of French, and therefore
<PB N="234" REF="035693_0232_10064D97E094F528">
did not know what they required him to do, the natural di&s;gu&s;t which &s;uch a &s;pectacle in&s;pired, taught him to turn away the bloody head with both his hands. But the greater reluctance he ex|pre&s;&s;ed, and the more he prote&s;ted, in German, again&s;t this violence, the more ob&s;tinate the peo|ple became, and with frantic &s;houts in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould obey.</P>
<P>Jeanette dropped down &s;en&s;ele&s;s. Her faithful &s;ervant was torn from the box, kicked and abu&s;ed in the mo&s;t cruel manner. Peter mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice to their fury, if the attention of the mi&s;creants had not been withdrawn from the foot|man to his mi&s;tre&s;s in the carriage. "This way, brothers!" cried one of them in a brutal tone, "here is an Au&s;trian lady, who cannot &s;tand the &s;ight of royali&s;t blood." They broke open the carriage, pulled out the uncon&s;cious victim, &s;earch|ed her pockets, plundered her of her money, took her pa&s;&s;port, tore it to pieces, and &s;cattered it in the air.</P>
<P>Already a thou&s;and voices thundered her doom, and a &s;avage mon&s;ter, with an ax in his hand, offered to undertake the office of her executioner. Mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onably, at this moment, a young man, of a genteel appearance, followed by a detachment of the national guard, made his way through the crowd, and, in the name of the law, enjoined tran|quillity. This command, enforced by threatening bayonets, procured re&s;pect, and re&s;cued the victim. The people di&s;per&s;ed with murmurs.</P>
<P>When Jeanette opened her eyes, &s;he found her|&s;elf, &s;urrounded by &s;oldiers, in the arms of a young man, who gazed at her with complacency. He announced him&s;elf as the mayor of the town, and &s;o politely congratulated him&s;elf on his good for|tune in being her deliverer, that Jeanette imme|diately recogni&s;ed him to be an elegant, accom|pli&s;hed
<PB N="235" REF="035693_0233_10064D99697EC5B0">
man.&mdash;"Take courage, madam," &s;aid he with re&s;pectful intere&s;t, "the danger is over. Have the goodne&s;s to allow me to conduct you to my hou&s;e. My wife and I will do every thing in our power to give you a better opinion of our town."</P>
<P>The mention of a wife redoubled Jeanette's con|fidence; &s;he accepted his offer with thanks; he a&s;|&s;i&s;ted her into the carriage, which the guard &s;ur|rounded, and he him&s;elf followed on foot. Poor Peter was &s;o beaten and brui&s;ed, that he was not able to mount the coach-box, but was obliged to be led by two grenadiers. He had, at la&s;t, found out what they wi&s;hed him to do, and in whimper|ing voice cur&s;ed the horrible propo&s;al. "Were there never," &s;aid he to his conductors, "another woman for me in the world but here, and were &s;he the faire&s;t that ever was &s;een, I &s;hould not come for her to your country, and be forced to ki&s;s bloody heads." The &s;oldiers looked at him and laughed, for they did not under&s;tand what he &s;aid&mdash;Every body knows, but the circum&s;tance has never been explained, even by Kant, that an ignorant man always laughs when he does not un|der&s;tand a thing.&mdash;The mayor's lady welcomed the &s;tranger with polite ho&s;pitality. She was u&s;hered into an elegant apartment, which was furni&s;hed with every conveniency; the table was covered with all kinds of refre&s;hments. They pre&s;&s;ed her earne&s;tly to partake of them; but when &s;he a&s;&s;ur|ed them that &s;he wanted nothing but repo&s;e, they politely withdrew and left her alone.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t care was to thank God on her knees for her deliverance. She threw her&s;elf on the bed, which was adorned with &s;ilken curtains, that form|ed an agreeable &s;hade. She fell a&s;leep, and did not awake till the evening, greatly refre&s;hed. Scarcely had a little noi&s;e &s;he made announced
<PB N="236" REF="035693_0234_10064D9B4C3E23D8">
that &s;he was awake, when the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e drew a&s;ide the curtains, kindly inquired how &s;he did, and invited her to &s;upper in the family circle.</P>
<P>Jeanette appeared in full &s;plendour of youthful beauty. The ro&s;es which terror had cha&s;ed from her cheeks, bloomed afre&s;h. Refre&s;hing &s;leep, and a delightful dream of having met with her hu&s;band, had kindled a delicate fire in her eye. Every body complimented her, all pre&s;&s;ed round her, every one endeavored to &s;ay &s;omething civil, and Beaublanc him&s;elf (for that was the mayor's name) di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his a&s;&s;iduity, con|ver&s;ed with her in the mo&s;t agreeable manner, and &s;trove to anticipate her mo&s;t trivial wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Jeanette would have forgot her&s;elf in this plea|&s;ing &s;ociety, if her anxiety to &s;ee William had not been much more powerful than the charms of any kind of amu&s;ement. Immediately after &s;upper &s;he entreated her deliverer to &s;end for po&s;t hor&s;es, as &s;he wi&s;hed to pur&s;ue her journey, even by night. Her reque&s;t &s;eemed to throw him into &s;ome con|fu&s;ion. He repre&s;ented to her the nece&s;&s;ity of re|po&s;e; he called a phy&s;ician, who happened to be in company, to give weight to his remon&s;trance; and when nothing could &s;hake the impatience of the anxious wife to be gone, he exaggerated the dangers to which &s;he expo&s;ed her&s;elf, as the people &s;till &s;warmed di&s;orderly round the hou&s;e; he pro|mi&s;ed her next day to take precautions for her &s;afety. All was in vain. Jeanette per&s;evered in her re&s;olution to &s;et off immediately.</P>
<P>Beaublanc at la&s;t was obliged to acquie&s;ce, and begged to &s;ee her pa&s;&s;port, which his duty required him to examine. Jeanette ha&s;tily put her hand in her pocket&mdash;but how great was her terror when &s;he found neither pa&s;&s;port nor money, and was obliged to bring out her hand empty!&mdash;"Ah! God!" exclaimed &s;he, turning pale as a&s;hes&mdash;
<PB N="237" REF="035693_0235_10064D9CDC2E0128">
"Ah! God!"&mdash;She could &s;ay no more&mdash;her knees &s;hook, and &s;he was forced to &s;it down.</P>
<P>The mayor &s;eemed to receive the news of this unfortunate accident with feigned concern, and a &s;ecret joy was painted in his countenance. He com|forted her with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s, and promi&s;ed to write immediately to Paris, giving a faithful &s;tate|ment of the accident, and immediately procure her a new pa&s;&s;port. He a&s;&s;ured her likewi&s;e that &s;he need not be under any unea&s;ine&s;s re&s;pecting money, for he &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf happy in being permitted to lend her. He entreated her, during the &s;hort delay, to con&s;ider his hou&s;e as her own, and in the mean time to announce to her hu&s;band her &s;peedy arrival.</P>
<P>She li&s;tened to all he &s;aid in &s;ilent &s;tupor, and could only expre&s;s her thanks in broken &s;entences.</P>
<P>The propo&s;als, indeed, were the mo&s;t agreeable which, in her &s;ituation, could be made; and &s;ince fortune had re&s;olved to make her the object of its caprice, it was happy that &s;he had found a hou&s;e were &s;he could remain with comfort and with re&s;|pectability, and await a more favorable turn of her affairs. She yielded, therefore, to the nece&s;&s;ity of circum&s;tances, and with tears entreated the mayor to ha&s;ten his proffered a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>He repeated the con&s;olatory a&s;&s;urance, promi&s;|ed this very evening to di&s;patch a courier to Paris, and in the mean time enjoined his dome&s;tics to do every thing to render the agreeable &s;tranger as happy as her &s;ituation would admit. "My exam|ple," added he, "will teach you how to con|duct your&s;elves."</P>
<P>Alas! this la&s;t was the only point in which he kept his word. Beaublanc belonged to that cla&s;s of good weak men who are irre&s;i&s;tibly attracted by new charms. He was married to an amiable woman, with whom before his marriage he had
<PB N="238" REF="035693_0236_10064D9FA261BA30">
carried on a long and romantic court&s;hip, and en|countered a thou&s;and ob&s;tacles before he attained the object of his wi&s;hes. He loved her &s;till, his heart was hers, but his licentiou&s;ne&s;s &s;he was not able to re&s;train. Many a tear &s;he wept in &s;ecret; &s;ometimes a tender reproach e&s;caped her, which the young man felt indeed, but it produced no other effect but to render him more guarded in his in|trigues, and more &s;ecret in his infidelities. When he was detected, he threw him&s;elf at her feet, cla&s;p|ed her knees, wept, intreated, called him&s;elf a wretched licentious profligate, and could not con|ceive, when he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o amiable a wife, how he could have any ta&s;te for other charms. In a word, he never cea&s;ed till &s;he tenderly forgave him.</P>
<P>After the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;ucceeded an interval of dome&s;tic happine&s;s for two or three months, dur|ing which his wife was &s;atisfied with his conduct, and he was &s;atisfied with him&s;elf; for after &s;uch occurrences he &s;eriou&s;ly endeavoured to correct his bad habits, but all his re&s;olution vani&s;hed if a new beauty fell in his way. In a word, he re&s;em|bled a needle, which turns &s;teadily to its pole &s;o long as it is not attracted by &s;ome new and more powerful magnet.</P>
<P>Jeanette's appearance happened ju&s;t in one of the&s;e intervals of dome&s;tic tranquility, during which Beaublanc had been the be&s;t hu&s;band in the world, and when he had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed after his la&s;t error never to wander again. Who could have &s;u&s;pected that he &s;hould thus accidentally meet with a woman like Jeanette? who &s;eemed as if formed by an adver&s;e fate on purpo&s;e to triumph over his firme&s;t re&s;olutions. When he re&s;cued her from the fury of the populace; when &s;he lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s in his arms, and her half-covered bo&s;om beat again&s;t his; when her lily cheeks touched his, and his mouth received the fir&s;t breath which re|animated
<PB N="239" REF="035693_0237_10064DA291B16B40">
her lips&mdash;ah! his heart was gone!&mdash;His attention, his ho&s;pitality, his humane exertions &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ang from a &s;ource which his experienced wife ea&s;ily di&s;covered. The&s;e &s;u&s;picions which had been but too often ju&s;tified, awaked. She trembled, and concealed her apprehen&s;ion, too patient to cry Fire on perceiving the fir&s;t &s;parks, and too gener|ous to revenge the incon&s;tancy of her hu&s;band on an innocent &s;tranger.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t day &s;he con&s;oled her&s;elf in the expectation of the &s;peedy departure of her gue&s;t; but when the di&s;agreeable accident of the lo&s;s of the pa&s;&s;port was mentioned, when &s;he di&s;covered the &s;ecret joy of her hu&s;band, and &s;aw her&s;elf compelled to entertain &s;o dangerous a rival in the hou&s;e for &s;everal weeks, her only hope was in the character of the &s;tranger, who&s;e dignified manners and mo|de&s;t re&s;erve in&s;pired her with confidence that the licentious views of her hu&s;band would here be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>She was not mi&s;taken. It was &s;ome time before Jeanette perceived the unwelcome triumph of her charms; and when &s;he could no longer doubt the fact, it cau&s;ed her the mo&s;t cruel vexation. Her &s;ituation became more painful than ever. What could &s;he now do?&mdash;Was &s;he to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;e with importunities the man who had &s;aved her life, and given her a &s;ecure a&s;ylum in his hou&s;e?&mdash;But he had not yet made any expre&s;s declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion. His looks only &s;poke what he felt; a thou|&s;and little attentions betrayed the &s;tate of his heart. It was po&s;&s;ible that he &s;truggled with him&s;elf, that he endeavored to extingui&s;h his ri&s;ing attachment, and in this ca&s;e he de&s;erved pity rather than reproach. How happy would &s;he have been to have aided his &s;truggling virtue by a &s;udden &s;light! but whither could &s;he fly, without money, and without a pa&s;&s;|port?</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="035693_0238_10064DA41B9D5218">Should &s;he confide the &s;ecret to her kind ho&s;te&s;s? Ought &s;he to awaken the jealou&s;y of an un&s;u&s;pect|ing wife; and, as a reward for her &s;i&s;terly atten|tion, plant a dagger in her heart? No! She ra|ther cho&s;e to be &s;ilent, to conceal her angui&s;h, to throw a veil over her grief, and re&s;olved as much as po&s;&s;ible to avoid the company of Beaublanc, and to wait the arrival of her pa&s;&s;port in &s;olitude, which &s;he took every opportunity to indulge. She con|trived many pretexts for &s;pending the forenoon in her own apartment. In the afternoon &s;he was going to write to William, or an head-ache fur|ni&s;hed her with an apology, or &s;he walked with her ho&s;te&s;s in the garden. Often too unwelcome gue&s;ts detained the mayor, &s;o that he found but lit|tle opportunity to enjoy the company of his new love.</P>
<P>The conduct which Jeanette ob&s;erved was indeed perfectly well calculated to keep Beaublanc at a di&s;tance; but it could have little effect in repre&s;&s;ing his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ince perpetual ob&s;tacles only inflamed him the more, and drove him to de&s;pair. The more his wife felt her&s;elf indebted to the delicate and di&s;creet conduct of the generous &s;tranger, the more expedients did Beaublanc contrive to prolong Jeanette's &s;tay, in the hope that a favourable oppor|tunity would at la&s;t lead to the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>For the attainment of his object he was not very &s;crupulous about the means he employed. A month had elap&s;ed, the new pa&s;&s;port had really arrived, but Beaublanc concealed it. During this period Jeanette had written eight letters to her hu&s;band; but Beaublanc had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them, and his jealou&s;y delighted to ob&s;erve the angui&s;h of the wife, who con&s;idered William's &s;ilence as an ill pre&s;age. He him&s;elf undertook to make inquiries in the place where William re&s;ided, but only to communicate
<PB N="241" REF="035693_0239_10064DA5E5B60998">
to her equivocal intelligence. Sometimes he gave the anxious wife rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the death of her hu&s;band; &s;ometimes he told her of a pri&s;oner of war an&s;wering his de&s;cription who had married a rich heire&s;s.</P>
<P>With regard to the pa&s;&s;port, it was ea&s;ier to mi&s;|lead her un&s;u&s;pecting confidence; for what could be more natural than in the revolutionary confu|&s;ion which now prevailed in Paris that &s;uch a tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;hould be forgotten?&mdash;A letter to There&s;a remained unan&s;wered. There&s;a and William were &s;ilent preci&s;ely for the &s;ame rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The poor forlorn Jeanette, &s;eparated from all &s;he loved and honored, trembling for the life of her hu&s;band, of her child, wept bitter tears in &s;ecret. As Beaublanc had now completely laid a&s;ide the ma&s;k, as he became more pre&s;&s;ing, and did not he&s;|itate eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to offend her tender ear with his ardent pa&s;&s;ion, her &s;orrows reached the highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>She endeavored by raillery and remon&s;trance, by &s;everity and by mildne&s;s, to recall him to the path of rea&s;on and of duty, but in vain. He remained unmoved by her tears, deaf to her repre&s;entations, and callous to the &s;ilent grief of his wife. He was at no pains to conceal the hope that William might be dead. He laboured to render her familiar with this frightful idea. He in&s;inuated how ea&s;y it would be for him, according to the pre&s;ent marriage code of France, to procure a &s;eparation from his wife. He dropped hints of his wealth, his con&s;e|quence, the &s;plendid life which he could enable a wife whom he loved to enjoy. In a word, he left no arts unemployed which could &s;hake Jeanette's con|jugal fidelity. Her pa&s;&s;ions he likewi&s;e endeavored to engage by the di&s;play of an elegant figure which was animated and adorned by the glow of love; and he exerted him&s;elf to give it new charms by the mo&s;t ta&s;teful di&s;play of dre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="035693_0240_10064DAA0D0E6458">It is unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ure the reader that all his arts were ba&s;&s;led, and fell harmle&s;s from Jeanette's heart, like a blunt arrow from a mail of &s;teel. Not a foul drop ever mingled in the pure fountain of her feelings. Never once did her vanity li&s;ten with compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cency to his pa&s;&s;ion, and even the cer|tainty of William's death would have produced no alteration in her &s;entiments. But this did not at all contribute to render her &s;ituation le&s;s wretch|ed. She was dependent upon a man who laboured to obtain his criminal object at every ri&s;k; who, as appeared, did not even &s;hrink from the com|mi&s;&s;ion of a crime if it promi&s;ed to conduct him to his wi&s;hes; for he had now gone &s;o far as to throw out menaces, and to drop hints at which her vir|tue trembled.

<P>After Babet di&s;appeared, and his friend was torn from him, William's mo&s;t delightful dreams now hung undivided upon his native land, on his beloved Jeanette, the object of his mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes. En|gro&s;&s;ed with the&s;e contemplations, he &s;trolled in harve&s;t through the fading flowers; or, when the bu&s;tle of indu&s;try offered him unwelcome amu&s;e|ment, he plunged into the &s;hady rece&s;&s;es of a wood, or &s;tole among the bulru&s;hes which &s;kirted a mur|muring brook. The hope of again finding Babet daily decrea&s;ed, like the bank which the &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m every moment wa&s;hes and &s;weeps away.</P>
<P>One day the morning had i&s;&s;ued from the cham|bers of the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t wrapped in a veil of thick mi&s;es, but the &s;un had withdrawn the clouds from the face of day, as a youthful hu&s;band by his care&s;&s;es prevails upon his wife t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lay a&s;ide her veil&mdash;Wil|liam &s;tood earlier <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hal upon a little hillock near the town, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> meditations, which the land&s;cape around and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> view of the flitting clouds had in&s;pired. He thought of the birth of man, and the fir&s;t dawn of life; how often the cradle of
<PB N="244" REF="035693_0242_10064DAD4AC7B848">
a king is adorned by the beams of morn, while before 'tis noon the throne is involved in clouds and tempe&s;ts; how often darkne&s;s and mi&s;ts co|ver the poor man's cradle, while the caprice of fortune prepares for the ob&s;cure child a &s;erene and joyful evening. His own example recurred to his mind, and with the la&s;t traces of the parting clouds his gratitude mounted up to heaven.</P>
<P>The temper of his &s;oul was now &s;o &s;ublimated that it &s;ought for kindred objects, and he therefore re&s;olved this day to a&s;cend to the top of a hill, which he had long marked out as the boundary of his ex|cur&s;ions. The way to it was through the village, the inhabitants of which, &s;ince the conflagration, loved him with brotherly affection. He wi&s;hed to pa&s;s on unob&s;erved; but the little boy he had &s;aved came running after him, and pulling him by the coat, &s;aid: "Mother is coming too; &s;he can|not run &s;o fa&s;t." William &s;topped, and waited till the young woman came up with the mo&s;t cordial expre&s;&s;ions of joy, and held out to him her &s;miling infant. She kindly complained that he had quite forgot her; the boy had daily a&s;ked for him, and &s;he had been much grieved at his ab&s;ence. A thou&s;and times &s;he had thanked God for the deliv|erance of her children, but &s;he had lamented that &s;he had not an opportunity to expre&s;s her gratitude to the angel whom God had &s;ent. She then in|formed him that &s;he now lived in the hou&s;e of her father-in-law till her cottage was rebuilt, and beg|ged him to be &s;o good as come and partake of a rural breakfa&s;t. She was &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, &s;he &s;o eager|ly wi&s;hed in this way to &s;how her kindne&s;s, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>He was conducted to a neat, clean hou&s;e, where he was cordially received by an old man with &s;il|ver grey locks. Every body was employed in the hou&s;e; they ran backwards and forwards, &s;ought

the white&s;t cloth, the cleare&s;t gla&s;&s;es, the fine&s;t plates. They brought out honey, butter, milk, and fruits; and every eye &s;parkled with joy when the welcome gue&s;t &s;eemed to eat with appetite. They appeared delighted that their efforts had &s;uc|ceeded in plea&s;ing their benefactor.</P>
<P>The young woman told him that during his ab|&s;ence her hu&s;band and brother had been at home, and heard of his noble deed, and both of them intended to come to town to thank him, but the calls of &s;ervice prevented them. "Ye&s;terday," added the weeping wife, "they were &s;ent off in &s;earch of ari&s;tocrats, and God knows when they will return."</P>
<P>At the late&s;t, however, &s;he hoped they would be home on Saturday, and William was obliged to promi&s;e &s;olemnly to repeat his vi&s;it next Sunday.</P>
<P>After he had eat and drank a great deal from pure complai&s;ance, he told the good people his in|tention to walk to the top of the hill, which be|gan gradually to a&s;cend ju&s;t at the back of the vil|lage. He inquired which road he ought to take. They told him it was &s;everal miles to the top; fir&s;t, he mu&s;t cro&s;s a bridge, then he would come to a &s;heep-cot, then he mu&s;t quit the road, and a&s;cend by the left-hand way. The a&s;cent was &s;teep and difficult. They advi&s;ed him to provide him&s;elf with refre&s;hments, and in&s;i&s;ted on filling his pock|ets with fruit. William, however, refu&s;ed, as he wi&s;hed to be as light as po&s;&s;ible; and &s;aid, if nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould find milk at the &s;heep-cot to which he was directed. The young woman, however, repre&s;ented the inhabitants to be rough unobliging people, and de&s;ired him to ob&s;erve a &s;mall hou&s;e, not far from the &s;heep-cot. "There," &s;aid &s;he, "lives our con&s;titutional prie&s;t, a good, kind-hearted man; call there if you want refre&s;h|ment.
<PB N="246" REF="035693_0244_10064DB463A780A0">
He receives every body with welcome."</P>
<P>William thanked her, and went away with the re&s;olution to call no where unle&s;s he was compelled by &s;ome unfore&s;een accident. He ea&s;ily found the road which had been pointed out to him, lay on the top of the hill, and enjoyed the delightful pro&s;|pect into the fertile valley below, through which the river rolled along, in a thou&s;and meanders. He traced out Babet's de&s;erted habitation, the &s;ight of which bani&s;hed the &s;erenity of his &s;oul. He re&s;ol|ved to look at it no more, and his eyes &s;till recur|red to it. The land&s;cape lo&s;t its charms, he &s;unk into a melancholy mood, and did not ob&s;erve that twilight began to approach.</P>
<P>He &s;tarted up. The &s;hades of night already covered the valley. A grey &s;treak of the &s;etting &s;un &s;till glittered on the &s;ummits of the rocks. He ha&s;tily de&s;cended the foot-path, and night thickened fa&s;t around. Too much precipitation might lead him a&s;tray. He began, therefore, to walk more &s;lowly, and to examine the path, &s;ince, if he lo&s;t it, he mu&s;t be compelled to pa&s;s the cold harve&s;t night in the open air in this &s;olitude, which after his late illne&s;s, might be attended with danger.</P>
<P>He was extremely happy, therefore, after wan|dering &s;everal hours through unbeaten tracks, to reach a fold belonging to the &s;heep-cot. Recol|lecting the advice of his friends, however, he did not call, but directed his &s;teps to the abode of the prie&s;t, who&s;e white-wa&s;hed walls glittered through the &s;hade at the di&s;tance of a few hundred paces. Here he re&s;olved to beg a night's lodging, as it be|gan to rain, and the darkne&s;s became every moment thicker.</P>
<P>As no light appeared through the windows, he began to fear that there was nobody at home, and was about to ring the bell, when the &s;creams of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> female voice &s;truck his ear. The &s;ound &s;eemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

proceed from a back hou&s;e or cellar, and William di&s;tinctly heard the words "<HI>Help! help!</HI>"</P>
<P>He now pulled the bell with violence &s;everal times. He endeavored to open the hou&s;e-door, but it was locked. He attempted to get over the wall round the court, but it was too high. The &s;creams &s;till continued, and cut him to the heart. He ran anxiou&s;ly as fa&s;t as he could round the whole place, hovering like a hen over a pond where her fo&s;ter ducklings &s;wim. He reached a garden fenced with a thick hedge. He was not deterred by the thorns, continued to make his way through, and ha&s;tened to the place from which the cries proceed|ed.</P>
<P>He came to a back-door, which appeared but ill &s;ecured; he &s;truck it with his foot, and it flew open. He entered, &s;tumbled, and fell. An iron &s;hovel lay in his way: he ro&s;e, &s;eized the &s;hovel, for &s;ome ob&s;cure feeling told him that here arms were nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;hrieks had changed into moan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of lamentations; he followed the &s;ound, which &s;oon brought him to the door of a room. It was &s;hut; he thund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red at it with his fi&s;t. A man's voice cried, "<HI>Who is there?</HI>"</P>
<P>"Open," cried William.&mdash;They refu&s;ed.&mdash; "Open, or I will break open the door!"&mdash;They &s;till refu&s;ed. William threw him&s;elf with all his force again&s;t the door, and drove it from its hinges.</P>
<P>At this moment the light in the room was ex|tingui&s;hed, and William received a violent blow on the &s;houlder, which probably was aimed at his head. He ea&s;ily could di&s;cern the figure that had &s;truck the blow. He lifted up his &s;hovel, and &s;truck &s;o violent a blow at the &s;hadow, that the latter cried, "Je&s;u Maria!" and dropped to the ground.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time another figure &s;lipped pa&s;t him out at the door. He now remained thunder&s;truck in this extraordinary &s;ituation; here at his feet a

man whom probably he had mortally wounded, a few &s;teps from him a low voice of lamentation con|tinued to moan; utter darkne&s;s prevailed, and the whole hou&s;e was utterly unknown. He groped round the place from which the &s;ound proceeded, &s;truck again&s;t a bed, and found a per&s;on whom by the dre&s;s he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a lady.</P>
<P>"Who is here?" &s;aid he. Groans were the on|ly an&s;wer. He was almo&s;t inclined to join in uni&s;on with the&s;e groans, for the pain in his &s;houl|der was very violent. Without light, however, he could neither a&s;&s;i&s;t him&s;elf nor others. But where was he to find it?&mdash;Where was the kitchen, in which, perhaps, the fire was &s;till alive in the embers? He went out, groped along the wall, creeped through the whole hou&s;e, &s;ometimes found the doors open, &s;ometimes &s;hut, but no where was he &s;ought. He now was unable to find the way back to the my&s;terious chamber, and had re&s;olved to wait on the &s;tair till morning, when he heard keys turning, and a door &s;ling open with great noi&s;e. A number of voices &s;ounded through the pa&s;&s;age, and a gleam of light was &s;een at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of his innocence, he went fearle&s;s to meet the party, and found a number of half-naked pea&s;ants, who, armed with all kinds of weapons, pre&s;&s;ed in, led by an ugly old woman with a lan|thorn.&mdash;"There is the robber," cried the woman when &s;he &s;aw William. He had thrown down the &s;hovel; the pea&s;ants &s;eized him quite defence|le&s;s, and tied his hands behind his back.</P>
<P>In vain he prote&s;ted his innocence, in vain he attempted to relate the accident which had brought him to the hou&s;e; the old beldame bore him down. "He meant to rob my good ma&s;ter, your worthy pa&s;tor!" cried &s;he with &s;hrill voice. "Who knows but he may have already murdered him? His niece, the villain fir&s;t gagged; by God's mercy I contri|ved to e&s;cape in the dark."</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="035693_0247_10064DB9427D9A90">The accu&s;ation was &s;o mon&s;trous, that William was amazed, and viewed the woman with looks or contempt.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. A CRITICAL SITUATION.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE is &s;o fruitful in &s;urpri&s;ing incidents, that the mo&s;t creative imagination cannot &s;urpa&s;s her works. The reader &s;hould not, there|fore, pronounce this hi&s;tory improbable becau&s;e it is &s;urpri&s;ing. We live in times when it would be matter of no great wonder to &s;ee the Emperor of China, like Diony&s;ius of old, turn &s;choolma&s;ter. Why then &s;hould we wonder to find a prie&s;t in his vocation? But he was a convicted child-murderer! &mdash;Why, what then?&mdash;When the innocent and vir|tuous La Fayette langui&s;hes in a dungeon, is it matter of &s;urpri&s;e that an infamous mi&s;creant &s;hould be at large? As long as the former is found not improbable, the latter mu&s;t be allowed to pa&s;s for ever natural.&mdash;The whole affair too hangs &s;o &s;imply together, that it is very ea&s;y to &s;olve the my&s;tery.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="035693_0248_10064DBE0C408920">The prie&s;t, as the reader will remember, in the fir&s;t volume of this hi&s;tory was withdrawn from the civil power, and &s;hut up in a cloi&s;ter. This, however, was done only <HI>pro forma,</HI> to remove him from the view of the good believers, who might have taken offence at his little mi&s;chievous tricks. His more tolerant brethren took no offence at the matter, but cha&s;ti&s;ed him as the Spartans u&s;ed to cha&s;ti&s;e a boy who happened to &s;teal clum&s;ily. After a &s;hort confinement, they gave him money for his expences, and &s;ent him about his bu&s;ine&s;s. He cho&s;e France as the place of his retreat, where, according to the &s;pirit of the prie&s;thood, he took a &s;hare in every thing, accommodated him&s;elf to the &s;pirit of the time, practi&s;ed the ea&s;y art of in|gratiating him&s;elf with the people, was one of the fir&s;t who, without &s;cruple, took the famous con|&s;titutional oath, recommended him&s;elf to the peo|ple in power, and, in the mo&s;t natural way ima|ginable, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the confidence of an un&s;u&s;pecting congregation, who cho&s;e him their pa&s;tor, and &s;ettled upon him a con&s;iderable income and a comfortable hou&s;e, from which a worthy old man, who&s;e con&s;cience revolted from the oath, was driven naked and helple&s;s.</P>
<P>Here he played his part with more prudence and &s;ucce&s;s than in Germany.

<PB N="251" REF="035693_0249_10064DBF98F75F68">
that he dropped the de&s;ign of marrying her which he had fir&s;t conceived, and employed her helli&s;h art in corrupting the innocence of the country girls, till Babet's charms captivated his foul pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>That very day when William was attacked by the fever, and Babet expected her friend under the lime-tree on the lawn, accident brought the prie&s;t this way. He &s;aw the lovely maid, as &s;he lay care|le&s;lly on the bench, her head reclining on her &s;now white hand, while her auburn locks waved round her bo&s;om, and her elegant foot played in the &s;and. This was more than &s;ufficient to inflame his pa&s;|&s;ions. He approached, with that &s;oft, &s;impering air which he had ever at command, as a courtier his &s;mile. "Tho&s;e mourning weeds," &s;aid he, "tell me that you are in grief, and my office ju&s;tifies me in intruding upon you with an offer of con&s;olation."</P>
<P>He &s;at down be&s;ide her, and talked to her a jar|gon for which we Germans ought to have a word, &s;ince the thing may likewi&s;e be found among the prie&s;ts of our country. Babet, educated in a cloi&s;ter, was accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider the&s;e wolves in &s;heep's cloathing as a &s;uperior cla&s;s of beings. She recei|ved him with re&s;pect and confidence. She rejoi|ced once more to &s;ee a prie&s;t, who&s;e con&s;oling con|ver&s;ation &s;he had been &s;o long denied. She wil|lingly gave him permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her daily. She even begged him to come, and, on the very fir&s;t interview, joyfully offered him one of her dia|monds to &s;ay ma&s;&s;es for the &s;ouls of her father and brother.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t &s;oon found what an un&s;u&s;picious crea|ture chance had thrown in his way. The very next vi&s;it he di&s;covered all Babet's &s;ecrets of every kind; he learnt the flight of her brother, her attachment to William, the trea&s;ure &s;he had concealed in the ca&s;ket; he di&s;covered all, and bounded with joy, like Satan in Klop&s;tock's Me&s;&s;iah. Any attempt, indeed, to change Babet's childi&s;h confidence into
<PB N="252" REF="035693_0250_10064DC121EBC2F8">
love, was not very likely to &s;ucceed, as &s;he was much too innocent to under&s;tand what he meant. When he gazed at her with glowing pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he con&s;idered his ardour to be paternal kindne&s;s; and when he pre&s;&s;ed her hand, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed his re&s;pect|fully. To give her any opportunity of di&s;cover|ing the foul corruption of his heart was dangerous: her innocence might be alarmed, and &s;he might take offence.</P>
<P>Under pretence of placing her in &s;afety, he pro|po&s;ed to take her home to his hou&s;e, as his niece. He repre&s;ented to her the danger to which &s;he was daily expo&s;ed in this &s;olitary habitation; the impro|priety of a young lady, quite de&s;erted, living thus without protection. He then di&s;played the ad|vantages of the undi&s;turbed tranquillity &s;he might enjoy at his hou&s;e, the &s;ecurity with which &s;he could there, unknown and unper&s;ecuted, indulge her grief, and perform the duties of devotion.</P>
<P>His arguments made an impre&s;&s;ion upon Babet, but they were not attended with all the effect which &s;he expected. The image of her friend was too deeply engraved upon her heart; &s;he mu&s;t &s;ee him and con&s;ult with him before &s;he finally adopt|ed a re&s;olution by which they would be &s;eparated. She did not, therefore, ab&s;olutely refu&s;e the pater|nal offer of the prie&s;t, as &s;he called it, but po&s;tpo|ned her deci&s;ion till William's recovery.</P>
<P>Such a delay and &s;uch con&s;ultation were not con|&s;i&s;tent with the prie&s;t's plan. He dreaded the return of this dangerous pri&s;oner, and &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of accompli&s;hing his purpo&s;e before the arrival of this friend oppo&s;ed a new ob&s;tacle to his &s;ucce&s;s. One evening, therefore, when Babet informed him with joy, that &s;he had received the mo&s;t favourable accounts of the convale&s;cence of her friend, and that &s;he expected to &s;ee him in a few days, he con|ceived a diabolical artifice for the completion of his de&s;ign.

</LETTER>
<P>Babet trembled as &s;he read this letter. Tears &s;tarted in her eyes, &s;i&s;terly affection glowed in her brea&s;t. Without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion &s;he in&s;tantly re&s;olved to tru&s;t her&s;elf with the expected me&s;&s;en|ger, to put the ca&s;ket into her pocket, to give her unfortunate brother the half of its contents, and by her tender con&s;olation perhaps &s;ave him from &s;elf-murder.</P>
<P>She had never &s;een the hand-writing of the Chevalier; but though &s;he had been acquainted with it, yet would not the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion have

ari&s;en in her guilele&s;s heart. With anxious impa|tience &s;he waited the day, and, with tender anxiety, the night. The prie&s;t vi&s;ited her as u&s;ual. He hoped &s;he would impart to him what had happened, and the re&s;olution &s;he had taken; but &s;he was &s;ilent. It was not <HI>her own</HI> &s;ecret; the care of her brother's &s;afety &s;ealed her lips.</P>
<P>The cunning &s;educer, however, ea&s;ily perceived that &s;he labored under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;ecret anxiety, and in her agitation he gue&s;&s;ed the &s;ucce&s;s of his villainy. In the evening he went away with an air &s;uch as the celebrated Catharine de Medicis might have a&s;&s;umed, when, for the la&s;t time, &s;he vi&s;ited the unfortunate Coligni. He drew him&s;elf up &s;quat in the middle of his net, like a malignant &s;pider, to be ready to &s;pring out on the harmle&s;s in&s;ect for which he had &s;pread it.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner gone than Babet began to pack up her ca&s;ket; and after a warm prayer to her guardian &s;aints, in the ob&s;curity of night, accom|panied by her faithful &s;ervant, the tripped through the court, li&s;tened, till &s;he heard a &s;light noi&s;e and coughing at the gate. It was the procur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s we have mentioned, who, like a rattle-&s;nake, opened her jaws to &s;wallow the fa&s;cinated bird.</P>

&s;o did Babet &s;hudder in wild di&s;may, when &s;he &s;aw the villain &s;he had begun to re&s;pect as a &s;econd father, unma&s;ked at her feet. For the fir&s;t two or three hours &s;he could neither &s;peak, &s;igh, nor weep. She was fir&s;t obliged to reflect on the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a ba&s;ene&s;s, before &s;he could com|plain or reproach The prie&s;t was obliged to con|fe&s;s his &s;hameful purpo&s;e before &s;he could com|prehend what he meant. When &s;he under&s;tood his de&s;ign, however, from impotent re&s;entment &s;he ro&s;e, at once, to the height of un&s;peakable con|tempt. Her innocence was &s;o intimately blended with the whole of what con&s;tituted <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> that &s;he felt that it could be torn from her only with her life. This feeling in&s;pired her with a di&s;cretion and courage far beyond her years and &s;trength. While the hours of night &s;lowly glided by, &s;he re|mained ob&s;tinately dumb, and not a motion of her eye betrayed the &s;malle&s;t intere&s;t in what pa&s;&s;ed around. She paid no attention either to the di&s;|gu&s;ting talk of the prie&s;t, or the wretched con&s;ola|tions of the procure&s;s. She &s;at in a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rance till morning dawned. When it was day, and &s;he heard at a little di&s;tance the &s;hepherd's pipe, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;tarted up, ran to the window, threw it open, and cried: "Help! help!"</P>
<P>The prie&s;t and his female Satan were alarmed at this unexpected movement. They pulled at the &s;truggling maid, who clung with her nails to the window &s;hutters, and cried with all her might. At la&s;t they di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngaged her by force, and hur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied her into a remote apartment.

<P>Her cries, mean while, had really a&s;&s;embled the &s;hepherd, who were ea&s;ily &s;atisfied with the &s;tory that their prie&s;t, who&s;e virtue they never &s;u&s;pected,

The prie&s;t de&s;ired the hone&s;t pea&s;ants to inform their neigh|bours of this circum&s;tance, that they might not again be alarmed by her cries. Thus every &s;u&s;pi|cion was obviated.

<P>The prie&s;t left none of his helli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h arts untried to habituate the mind of Babet to the thoughts of vice. Sometimes he de&s;cended to every kind of flattery, and again he endeavored to alarm her with the ba&s;e&s;t threats. On the one &s;ide he painted to her a life of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, if &s;he would con&s;ent to live with him as his mi&s;tre&s;s or his wife, and on the other, an ignominious death, &s;hould he give her up as a roy|ali&s;t to the exi&s;ting authorities. But neither his threats nor his flattery could produce the &s;malle&s;t effect on the pure innocence of the angelic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>The experienced procure&s;s endeavored to inflame her mind by la&s;civious de&s;criptions, but their pol|lutions could not &s;tain the mirror of her &s;oul.

The prie&s;t breathed out his foul &s;pirit, and the la&s;t influence which hell exerci&s;ed over the dying reprobate was to dictate the fal&s;e declaration that William was a robber, a murderer.&mdash;Thus did he de&s;cend to the other world; the hand of his murdered child &s;eized him, and led him di&s;mayed to the tribunal of an offended Judge.</P>
<P>But his villainous accu&s;ation remained behind. Every thing te&s;tified again&s;t William; the words of the decea&s;ed, the cries of the procure&s;s, the bro|ken door, the gagged maid, and la&s;tly his own confu&s;ion; for the &s;ight of his &s;uffering benefac|tre&s;s on the one hand, and of the dete&s;ted betrayer of his wife on the other, had &s;truck him dumb with a&s;toni&s;hment. Nothing declared in his fa|vor but the voice of Babet, and &s;he was con&s;idered our of her &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherds, who were attached to the hypo|critical priJ&s;t, loaded William with cur&s;es, and al|mo&s;t &s;acrificed his life to the fir&s;t dictates of their re&s;entment.

<P>Only in the village where William's friends lived did things a&s;&s;ume a different appearance.

<P>The rattling of keys &s;uddenly awaked him. Two &s;oldiers of the national guard entered with a dark lanthorn. William &s;tarted up, and thought the awful moment was come. In one of the &s;oldiers he recogni&s;ed the man to whom he had entru&s;ted the la&s;t proof of his love for Jeanette. "I am glad," &s;aid William, "that you have been cho&s;en to attend me on this occa&s;ion. Be witne&s;s of my

<P>"Be &s;ilent, and follow us," &s;aid the &s;oldiers, as he rai&s;ed up his chains to allow him to walk more ea&s;ily. William followed in &s;ilence. They led him through a gloomy pa&s;&s;age, which he never before had trod. They reached an open court. The &s;tars glimmered over their heads. William wondered to find that it was yet night. They came to a little door, which &s;tood open. When William went out, he heard the trampling of hor&s;es, and &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed a carriage and four. The &s;oldiers a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to mount, and took their &s;eats be&s;ide him.</P>
<P>Away they drove, full &s;peed. William knew not what they meant to do with him. He a&s;ked, but they gave him no an&s;wer, and the rattling of the carriage drowned his words. The moon ro&s;e. William looked round in the open fields&mdash;he thought it was all a dream.</P>
<P>After they had proceeded about a mile, they came to the high-way, and the carriage &s;uddenly &s;topped. They obliged him to di&s;mount. When he touched the ground, &s;ome per&s;on ki&s;&s;ed his hand, and bathed it with tears. William looked round&mdash;it was the young woman who&s;e children he had &s;aved.&mdash;The two &s;oldiers were her hu&s;band and brother.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band now pre&s;&s;ed him to his heart. "You &s;aved my children from the flames," &s;aid he with tears&mdash;"I have delivered you from an un|merited death&mdash;that was but the duty of a man, now &s;hall I reward you."</P>
<P>William followed him in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment; the young woman led him by the hand. A few &s;teps farther &s;omething white glittered behind a tree&mdash;a female figure now ru&s;hed into his arms.&mdash;

<P>IF the author &s;hould anticipate objections, and begin this chapter with the ob&s;ervation that "probability is really nothing more than the fea|&s;ibility or po&s;&s;ibility of a thing," it would &s;eem to infer that he him&s;elf entertained doubts of the probability of this true hi&s;tory.

It does not however require this foreign aid to ju&s;tify the incidents of this hi&s;tory; for the &s;imple&s;t &s;tate|ment will immediately bring down the reader from the fairy fields of the wonderful into the region of the uncommon, but at the &s;ame time very po&s;&s;ible,</P>
<P>Gratitude impelled the hone&s;t pea&s;ants, in con|tempt of every danger, to attempt William's deliv|erance. Their &s;ituation as &s;oldiers of the national guard, a&s;&s;i&s;ted however with Babet's diamonds, af|forded them ready means for the attainment of their purpo&s;e. While the hu&s;band began the un|dertaking, the wife, accompanied by her brother, went to the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed par&s;on, to di&s;|cover the meaning of William's my&s;terious reque&s;t. At fir&s;t, however, they found none but the old pro|cure&s;s, who was bu&s;y in packing up all the move|ables, in order to transfer them to &s;ome place of &s;afety. When a&s;ked whether there was not a mad girl in the hou&s;e, &s;he replied, that the poor creature had made her e&s;cape. Some degree of confu&s;ion, which &s;till lurked behind her unblu&s;hing impudence, excited &s;u&s;picion. The keys were demanded, which &s;he refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The woman and her brother agreed to &s;eparate, and traver&s;e the whole hou&s;e from top to bottom, and at every door they found &s;hut to call aloud, to a&s;certain whether any pri&s;oner would an&s;wer. This re&s;olution they immediately carried into effect. The one went up &s;tairs; the other down. In a few minutes they returned, and they had found more than they &s;ought. "Above, there," &s;aid the &s;i&s;ter, "I heard the voice of complaint." "And below, there," replied the brother, "I heard the &s;ound of groans in the cellar."</P>
<P>The procure&s;s was now aware of her danger.

The hone&s;t &s;oldier overtook her ju&s;t as &s;he was &s;tealing out at the garden-door. She had left be|hind the heavy and bulky part of the &s;poil, and con|tented her&s;elf with a &s;mall bundle, from which the &s;oldier pulled out a &s;u&s;picious-looking ca&s;ket. "To the right about, mi&s;tre&s;s!" &s;aid he in a &s;tern voice, &s;eizing her roughly by the arm: "Give me the keys, or I &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l plunge you into the pond."</P>
<P>This pond, which was but a few &s;teps di&s;tant, and the threatening a&s;pect of the young man, who&s;e flaming eyes promi&s;ed that he would keep his word, compelled the old &s;erpent to be more compliant. She offered to exchange the keys for the ca&s;ket; but this was refu&s;ed, in ca&s;e any body &s;hould be found who had a better claim to it. This hard condition produced a fruitle&s;s refu&s;al. The &s;ol|dier advanced a few paces nearer the pond, and the keys were delivered up.</P>
<P>Joyfully the young woman a&s;cended the &s;tair, and her brother ha&s;tily went down to the cellar. The former liberated the langui&s;hing Babet, and the latter brought out the half-&s;tarved maid-&s;ervant. While mutual explanations were going on, and Babet, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the pea&s;ants, related her unfortunate &s;tory, the old beldame took the opportunity of their confu&s;ion to make her e&s;cape. She made off without the booty of the ca&s;ket, but provided with accompli&s;hments by which &s;he every where earned a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, till at la&s;t, under Car|rier's admini&s;tration at Nantz, &s;he again ro&s;e to be a woman of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Babet was unable to give any &s;atisfactory ac|count of her fate till &s;he heard that William was alive, and that hopes were entertained of his deliv|erance. With joy &s;he offered the contents of her ca&s;ket to contribute to that object, an offer which, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, they promi&s;ed to accept.

Be&s;ides her own grief, that of an amiable young woman likewi&s;e lay heavy upon her heart for Beaublanc's wife could no longer conceal that the new infidelity of her hu&s;band was no &s;ecret to her. She indeed was perfectly con&s;cious to her&s;elf that Jeanette's con|duct was entirely unexceptionable. The fair &s;tran|ger, however, &s;till was the de&s;troyer of her peace, and &s;he could not love her. She &s;howed her all the attentions which her misfortunes and the duties of ho&s;pitality demanded; but the cordial kindne&s;s which &s;ea&s;ons all the&s;e attentions it was not in her power to di&s;play. A cold politene&s;s was all &s;he could be&s;tow, which to noble minds is not le&s;s galling than open hate.</P>
<P>They at la&s;t only met at table; they &s;aluted each other coldly; they talked only of the mo&s;t indif|ferent &s;ubjects, and both were glad when the de&s;|&s;ert was introduced. Beaublanc him&s;elf played a very awkward part. The more he felt the impro|priety of his conduct, the more he endeavored, as men u&s;ually do, to ju&s;tify it to him&s;elf by impu|ting it to cau&s;es in which he was not to blame. The cold behavior of his wife he did not overlook, and he reproached her for it when they were alone. She an&s;wered him only with tears, which &s;till more di&s;plea&s;ed him. In a word, the part which the different per&s;ons had to &s;upport was now become &s;o &s;erious, that a melancholy cata&s;trophe was ju&s;tly to be apprehended, when a beneficent <HI>deus ex machina</HI> appeared upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>One evening Jeanette heard a carriage drive up to the door, to which at fir&s;t &s;he paid no attention.
<PB N="265" REF="035693_0263_10064DDE92392D28">
When immediately on his arrival, however, &s;he heard the whole hou&s;e in motion; when &s;he heard baggage brought up &s;tairs, and Beaublanc's chil|dren &s;kipping about in great joy, &s;he a&s;ked the &s;er|vant who brought her a light, whether any company was come?&mdash;"Our ma&s;ter's grand-mother," &s;aid the man.</P>
<P>The news was very agreeable to Jeanette, partly becau&s;e &s;he hoped that Beaublanc in pre&s;ence of his grandmother would be more attentive to his wife, partly becau&s;e, in a company of per&s;ons who are intimately acquainted with each other's affairs, a &s;tranger is always welcome, becau&s;e it gives &s;ome relief to the conver&s;ation. Jeanette, therefore, when &s;ummoned to &s;upper, went down with more ea&s;e and courage then &s;he had done for &s;everal weeks. She &s;aw upon the &s;opha a venerable matron, who ro&s;e on her entrance, and, with that amiable frankne&s;s which age is entitled to di&s;play, came to meet her. Beaublanc pre&s;ented the old lady to her with the words "My grandmother, madame Jerome."</P>
<P>"Madame Jerome!" &s;tammered Jeanette, and grew pale.&mdash;"Madame Jerome!" &s;he repeated with an earne&s;tne&s;s which &s;truck the company.</P>
<P>"You appear to know that name," &s;aid the lady; "I flatter my&s;elf that it is not di&s;agreeable to you."</P>
<P>"Di&s;agreeable! No. Jerome was my father's name."</P>
<P>Beaublanc appeared &s;urpri&s;ed. The old lady &s;tarted. With vi&s;ible anxiety &s;he rubbed her hands, and &s;aid: "you are a German?"</P>
<P>"My father," continued Jeanette, "was a Frenchman, who had left his country for more than twenty years."</P>
<P>"His &s;irname?"</P>
<P>"Jo&s;eph Aime."</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="035693_0264_10064DE15AA72E60">"Great God!" exclaimed the old lady&mdash;her knees &s;hook&mdash;&s;he &s;unk in Beaublanc's arms. In a word, we need no longer conceal what the reader mu&s;t have anticipated: &s;he was Jeanette's grand|mother, and the mayor was Jeanette's cou&s;in german.</P>
<P>Extravagance and irregular conduct had former|ly irritated the old lady again&s;t her &s;on; &s;he bani&s;h|ed him from her pre&s;ence, and by her &s;everity compelled him to &s;eek his fortune in foreign coun|tries. Nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;the great ma&s;ter which leads its pupils either to virtue, or drives them to de&s;pair&mdash; had reclaimed the prodigal to the path of order and of indu&s;try. He did not choo&s;e, however, to com|municate any intelligence of him&s;elf to his mother till he had accumulated as much property as &s;hould enable him to di&s;pen&s;e with all a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his relations, in order that &s;he might have no founda|tion for thinking that he only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> repentance for the &s;ake of her money. When this moment arrived, he wrote the mo&s;t tender and affecting letters. A &s;eries of years however, had elap&s;ed; his family had experienced various vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;&s;itudes. From Picardy, where they formerly re&s;ided, they had, on account of accidents unconnected with the hi&s;tory, gone to re&s;ide in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> doe; his let|ters, therefore, never reached the place of their de&s;tination.</P>
<P>His fruitle&s;s expectation of an an&s;wer from his mother long embitt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red his dome&s;tic happine&s;s. He could a&s;cribe her &s;ilence only to two cau&s;es: either his mother was irreconci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble, or &s;he was dead. The former his heart di&s;claimed; he wept over her therefore, as no more, and cea&s;ed to write.</P>
<P>Madame Jerome, on the other hand, had long &s;ince forgotten her re&s;entment; for the re&s;entment of a mother is like a flake of &s;now in the month of May. She reproached her&s;elf bitterly for her har&s;h|ne&s;s. In the &s;leeple&s;s hours of night &s;he wept her

lo&s;t &s;on; &s;he &s;aw him wandering in the world poor and abandoned. With what joy would &s;he have called him back! but in what region of the globe was &s;he to &s;eek him?&mdash;With what anxiety did &s;he expect &s;ome filial application from him! But he was &s;ilent.&mdash;How often did &s;he invite him by pub|lic adverti&s;ements in the new&s;papers to return! They never reached him. Was it po&s;&s;ible that he, who, in &s;pite of his levity and wildne&s;s, was &s;o affectionate towards her, could remain &s;o long &s;ilent?&mdash;Ah! no! he is dead! he has fallen a &s;acrifice to his mother's unnatural &s;everity!</P>
<P>This reproach, which ince&s;&s;antly preyed on her maternal heart, threw a gloom over her evening of life&mdash;and now to be &s;o delightfully awaked from this di&s;agreeable dream! True, indeed, her Jo&s;eph was gone!&mdash;but he had lived happily, and he had left behind a youthful repre&s;entative, who fondly called her <HI>Mother</HI>; a being of her own fle&s;h and blood, and of whom &s;he had rea&s;on to be proud.</P>
<P>Every thing in the hou&s;e now a&s;&s;umed a quite different a&s;pect. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aublanc cea&s;ed to be an object of dread, &s;ince his c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;anguinity dictated to him n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, and &s;o pre&s;ence of his grandmother impo&s;ed upon him a &s;alutary re&s;traint. He was a&s;hamed when he reflected that madame Jerome had a right to &s;ay to him: "Bapti&s;te, remember with what a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to obtain your wife; think what I did and &s;acrificed to enable you to &s;ucceed." He trembled to think that his wife might complain of his conduct, and in what light he mu&s;t then appear to a mother, to whom he was indebted for &s;o many favors; one, too, whom amid&s;t all his errors he had ever continued to love with filial a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion.</P>
<P>Jeanette at l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t completed his reformation by a &s;tep which was now ea&s;y for her, &s;ince &s;he con&s;id|ered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eaublanc as her cou&s;in, and was &s;ecure in

the protection of her grandmother. She &s;ought what formerly &s;he had &s;o carefully avoided, an op|portunity of being alone with him. She even led the conver&s;ation to a circum&s;tance which &s;he for|merly did not wi&s;h to &s;eem to perceive, his pa&s;&s;ion for her. She then &s;poke with &s;uch intere&s;t to his heart; &s;he painted the &s;orrow of his wife and her own with &s;uch truth and feeling; &s;he mingled &s;uch cordial a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip and gratitude with her delicate reproaches, that he threw him&s;elf at her feet quite overcome, and with tears of the mo&s;t &s;incere repentance entreated her to forget his im|proper conduct.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t moments of repentance derive a pecu|liar &s;trength from that virtue which is ever ready to unite in the bands of cordial affection, when it ob&s;erves the lea&s;t advances to amendment. Beau|blanc felt in him&s;elf a &s;pirit which animated him with a &s;erene joy, to which he had long been a &s;tranger. He was happy to feel that it co&s;t him no pangs to prepare what was nece&s;&s;ary for Jea|nette's departure. A few days, indeed, &s;he was obliged to &s;pend with her new-di&s;covered grand|mother; but the good old lady was too con&s;iderate to require more than a few day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; under the con|dition however that Jeanette, with her hu&s;band and child, &s;hould vi&s;it her as &s;oon as the troubles of the republic allowed her to do it with &s;afety.</P>

<P>How peevi&s;h he feels at every crooked turning of the road! how he cur&s;es the phlegm of the po&s;|tillion, who, &s;o near the end of his journey, &s;tops to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en his &s;tirrup, or to take a gla&s;s of beer at &s;ome ob&s;cure inn!

O &s;evere trial of patience!

reached the gate, and had a new delay to encount<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r. Her pa&s;&s;port mu&s;t be examined. It availed no|thing here that nature had written the pa&s;&s;port of virtue and innocence upon her brow; this might have availed her only on the banks of the Ohio, or Hud&s;on's Bay. Captious objections were advan|ced; her per&s;on was to be compared with the de&s;|cription. Formalities and ceremonies of every kind were to be ob&s;erved. Here an officer of the municipality thought he di&s;charged his duty well in proportion to the time he con&s;umed; there an officer of police thought that the colour of her eyes did not exactly corre&s;pond with the original.</P>
<P>Every thing was at la&s;t adju&s;ted, pa&s;&s;port and baggage were &s;tamped with the &s;eal of liberty. The po&s;tillion &s;lowly mounted his hor&s;e, and, look|ing back, inquired where madame cho&s;e to alight.</P>
<P>"At the fir&s;t good inn," replied Jeanette ha&s;tily&punc; and the carriage rolled heavily through the &s;treets. The principal &s;treets were full of men; the win|dows were likewi&s;e crowded with &s;pectators.&mdash; Jeanette &s;aw nobody; &s;he looked only for William's face. The people &s;eemed in great agitation; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> words murder and guillotine were re-echoed through the mob.&mdash;Jeanette was quite ina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tentive to every thing; &s;he had no ears but for William's voice&punc; with a light &s;pring &s;he jumped out of the carriage when it &s;topped at the gate of an inn. A go&s;&s;iping ho&s;te&s;s conducted her up &s;tairs, and immediately began to entertain her with the news of the day. She told her that a pri&s;oner of war, an officer had murdered a con&s;titutional prie&s;t, and violated his niece; that he had been thrown into pri&s;on, and probably in a &s;hort time would receive his de&s;erts under the guillotine.</P>
<P>Jeanette &s;tarted at the words pri&s;oner of war, but in&s;tantly laid a&s;ide her fear when &s;he heard the nature of the crime of which he was accu&s;ed.

"He has dined at my table," &s;aid the prattling ho&s;te&s;s; "he appeared &s;o quiet, well-behaved a young man, that I would not have &s;crupled to have tru&s;ted him either with my &s;trong box or my daugh|ter.

<P>Jeanette &s;tood petrified, and the blood for&s;ook her cheeks.&mdash;"A cro&s;s?&mdash;Major?&mdash;What is his name?"</P>
<P>Alas! he had a very hard German name; the ho&s;te&s;s could not pronounce it. "But how did he look?"&mdash;She de&s;cribed his per&s;on, feature for fea|ture. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee that William had &s;at for the picture. From Jeanette's pale lips dropped the name of Eichenwald! and&mdash;"Right!" interrupt|ed the ho&s;te&s;s&mdash;"Right! Eichenwald is the very name!"</P>
<P>Poor Jeanette &s;unk to the ground; night ob&s;cu|red her eyes; her pul&s;e at her heart cea&s;ed to beat, and a convul&s;ive movement of her lips was the only &s;ymptom of life. The ho&s;te&s;s in terrible alarm, in|voking all the &s;aints to her aid, contributed all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in her power. "Ah! my God! Ah! poor madame!" &s;he repeated an hundred times, and tears of &s;ympathy bur&s;t from her eyes when &s;he heard that the lady before her was the wife of the unfortunate pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>She immediately &s;hut the door, that the populace might not hear of the di&s;covery, and confound in|nocence with guilt. But Jeanette became delirious: &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on going out&mdash;&s;he would throw her&s;elf at the feet of the judges&mdash;in the public market-place prote&s;t the innocence of her hu&s;band.&mdash;The good-natured ho&s;te&s;s was obliged to detain her by force; was obliged to &s;tifle her cries by &s;hutting the win|dows, and repeat to her a thou&s;and times that her interference would only accelerate the fate of her hu&s;band.

When the beams of hope, like an electrical &s;hock, re&s;tored her the u&s;e of her tongue, and &s;he again was able to &s;peak, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed upon the generous &s;oldier as much as was nece&s;&s;ary for the payment of all expences; but he in&s;i&s;ted that he alone mu&s;t an&s;wer the&s;e, &s;hould it co&s;t him his la&s;t &s;ixpence.</P>
<P>She now a&s;ked pen and ink to write a note to her hu&s;band to announce her arrival, and commu|nicate to him con&s;olation in his dungeon. The &s;ol|dier, however, refu&s;ed to carry the letter. He would not even undertake to inform the pri&s;oner of Jeanette's arrival, becau&s;e it was to be feared that his joy might betray him.</P>
<P>"Patience!" &s;aid the generous young man, "patience till to-morrow, or the day after; by that time it will be decided. Meanwhile this good wo|man will bring you as &s;oon as it is night to the vil|lage

where I re&s;ide. There you may remain in tranquility in my hou&s;e, and wait the re&s;ult."</P>
<P>"In tranquility!" &s;ighed Jeanette.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier endeavored to rai&s;e her &s;pirits, in|formed the ho&s;te&s;s which way &s;he &s;hould take, and ha&s;tened back to his po&s;t to avoid &s;u&s;picion. Re|gardle&s;s of her fever and her weakne&s;s, Jeanette prepared for her departure; and when night &s;pread its &s;hades over the earth, &s;he &s;et out in company with her worthy ho&s;te&s;s, and about midnight reach|ed the young woman's cottage. She was received as the wife of her benefactor, and in Babet &s;he found a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed in the heart of the lovely maid when &s;he &s;o &s;uddenly &s;aw the wife of her beloved appear, tho&s;e who are acquainted with the human heart may conceive.

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. THE FLIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader will not be greatly &s;urpri&s;ed that our hero, at the &s;cene before him, which &s;eem|ed altogether &s;o miraculous, began to think whether his head was not &s;eparated from his body, and tho&s;e he &s;aw were not the vi&s;ionary &s;hades of Ely&s;ium hovering round him:&mdash;The explanation of the my&s;tery, however, upon a public and well fre|quented road, might be dangerous. The brave &s;ol|dier rou&s;ed William from his dream, and led him into the thicket, where a large open cart waited for them, furni&s;hed with every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary to facilitate their flight.</P>
<P>In ten minutes William was freed from his irons. In&s;tead of his uniform, he put on a coar&s;e frock, and his hair he tied up under a red cap. Jeanette and Babet were likewi&s;e obliged to bind up their wav|ing locks in a le&s;s con&s;picuous form. Coar&s;e hand|kerchiefs concealed want their fa&s;hionable cor&s;&s;et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> threatened to betray; &s;hort clum&s;y coats di&s;gui&s;ed the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ces of their per&s;on, and mon&s;trous wooden &s;hoes covered their elegant feet.</P>
<P>Already Jeanette and Babet had taken leave of their kind ho&s;te&s;s, with tears. William had a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed them into the carriage, and was him&s;elf about to follow, when an unexpected di&s;covery changed his re&s;olution, and almo&s;t determined him volunta|rily to return to his pri&s;on. Till now it had never occurred to him, in the &s;lutter of &s;pirits into which he had been thrown, to inquire who was his con|ductor; and for the fir&s;t time he was fully aware of the extent of the &s;acrifice which gratitude had led the worthy ru&s;tics to make.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="035693_0274_10064DF849723E50">The &s;oldier had retired a few &s;teps with his wife. William &s;aw how anxiou&s;ly &s;he clung round his neck; he heard her &s;ob, and a&s;k when &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him again:&mdash;He heard her husband comfort|ing her in broken accents; he heard him ble&s;&s;ing her and his children, promi&s;ing to return as &s;oon as he could venture it without ri&s;k of his life.&mdash;The poor woman could not tear her&s;elf away; &s;he &s;till hung upon him to take her la&s;t embrace, till her husband whi&s;pered her: "Think of the fire, and our duty!"&mdash;She then let him go.</P>
<P>"God protect you!" &s;aid he, and went away.&mdash; His wife remained &s;tanding and wringing her hands. "No!" cried William with emotion&mdash;"No! I cannot purcha&s;e my life at &s;uch a price. If my deliverance mu&s;t render you an helple&s;s fugitive, your wife a widow, and your children orphans, I &s;hould a thou&s;and times rather return to my cell, and meet death to-morrow."</P>
<P>The&s;e words diffu&s;ed terror through the whole party. Babet and Jeanette ro&s;e up from their &s;eats, the &s;oldier &s;topped, his wife immediately dried up her tears, and &s;tifled her &s;ighs.&mdash;"What do you mean?" began the &s;oldier in firm voice. "Take your place quietly in the carriage. The &s;tep which puts my life in danger cannot be recalled. Suppo&s;e even that you were to return to your pri&s;on, it might now be more difficult to get into it unob&s;er|ved than it was to get out. You mu&s;t already be mi&s;&s;ed. If not, you cannot reach the town before day-break; and then it mu&s;t be ju&s;t as fatal to your guard, whether you really e&s;caped, or only attempt|ed it by his connivance. Away then, without lo&s;ing a moment! My wife and child I commit to the protection of God and my brother, who was not pre&s;ent with me on the po&s;t, and con&s;equently has nothing to an&s;wer for. I will conduct you to the frontiers, and there remain till the tyrant of

my country it overthrown, which &s;ooner or later mu&s;t happen, as I know the temper of my comrades. Ju&s;tice will then have time to breathe again, and it will no longer be reckoned criminal to obey the dictates of gratitude and humanity.&mdash;Away then, and God be with us!"</P>
<P>He &s;eized the reins, and leaped into the &s;addle. William, though his alarms were not bani&s;hed, was convinced by his arguments, that now to recede would nothing dimini&s;h the dangers to which the gallant fellow was expo&s;ed; he re&s;igned him&s;elf to nece&s;&s;ity, &s;eated him&s;elf by Jeanette's &s;ide, and the carriage drove on.</P>
<P>Had I <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouvet</HI>'s pen to paint the danger of this flight, the de&s;cription would an&s;wer the fearful ex|pectation of the reader. Often would he remain breathle&s;s with anxiety, and &s;tretch every fibre of attention.&mdash;Five nights they travelled through un|frequented roads, known only to their guide. Dur|ing the day they concealed them&s;elves in woods and deep retired vallies among the mountains. Twice did the harne&s;s break in pa&s;&s;ing over the rocks. On the third night they lo&s;t their way, and at dawn &s;aw, with terror and a&s;toni&s;hment, the lofty &s;pires of a large town at a little di&s;tance; and as they &s;uddenly turned the hor&s;es to &s;hun this danger, one of them dropped down dead.</P>
<P>The courage of the men and the firmne&s;s of the women at la&s;t overcame all dangers. The morning &s;un of the fifth day dawned as they entered the frontiers of Switzerland. In vain Jeanette opened her pur&s;e, and Babet her ca&s;ket, to &s;upply their gen|erous guide, at lea&s;t with what was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure him from want during his exile. "I can work," &s;aid he&mdash;"Indu&s;try and hone&s;ty are wel|come every where. If you would alleviate the pain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion from my family, give me nothing, in order that while I follow my labour, I may have the con&s;oling reflection that I have done well."</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="035693_0276_10064DFC9AC4D820">About noon, William with his fair companions reached a town, where they re&s;olved to recruit them|&s;elves after the many difficulties they had encoun|tered. There their hearts, for the fir&s;t time, open|ed to ea&s;y unembarra&s;&s;ed conver&s;ation. Fear no longer &s;ealed their lips, no dangers now obliterated the remembrance of the pa&s;t, or clouded their hopes of the future.</P>
<P>Jeanette had now an opportunity to inquire with cordial &s;ympathy the hi&s;tory of her husband's friend; and William availed him&s;elf of this occa|&s;ion to relate, in Babet's pre&s;ence, the &s;tate of his heart. He gained this advantage by the &s;tep, that he was not obliged to addre&s;s him&s;elf to Babet, and &s;he could blu&s;h in &s;ilence, as the looks of her friend were too delicate to dwell on her ingenuous &s;hame.</P>
<P>He now painted Frederick's pa&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t glowing colours, expatiated with eloquence on all the amiable qualites which the re&s;erve of his friend had rendered him incapable of di&s;playing, and con|cluded with the ardent wi&s;h (which he addre&s;&s;ed to heaven, and not to Babet) that the lovely creature might one day reward the fir&s;t love of a man of honour by a mutual attachment.</P>
<P>Babet was &s;ilent, and fixed her eyes on the ground. What really pa&s;&s;ed in her heart it is im|po&s;&s;ible for us to unfold. All that &s;he heard, however, connected with the impo&s;&s;ibility of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the man who had made the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on her heart, and now &s;poke &s;o warmly for another, combined too with her helple&s;s &s;ituation in a fo|reign land, produced no di&s;advantageous impre&s;&s;ion on her mind to Frederick's preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>William now was &s;ilent, and left the re&s;t to his wife, to whom he made a &s;ignificant &s;ign to &s;econd the wi&s;hes of Babet, convinced that in &s;uch ca&s;es a woman is the be&s;t agent that can be employed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. THE TYRANNY OF HONOUR.</HEAD>
<P>TWO days had now elap&s;ed. Repo&s;e and anxiety to &s;ee her child had armed Jeanette with new &s;trength. For &s;ome days pa&s;t &s;he had ob&s;erved a cloud on William's brow, the cau&s;e of which &s;he was unable to explain; and &s;he hoped, by a &s;peedy departure, to re&s;tore his wonted &s;eren|ity. She intreated him, therefore, to make pre|parations to &s;et out next morning, and he pro|mi&s;ed to comply.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e indeed appeared to co&s;t him &s;ome pain. He &s;eemed reluctantly to make prepara|tions for the journey; and the evening previous to their intended departure he was uncommonly pen&s;ive; melancholy clouded his open countenance. Jeanette's eye dwelt upon him with anxious looks; but as &s;he could not devi&s;e the rea&s;on, and he &s;tudi|ou&s;ly evaded her inquiries, &s;he contented her&s;elf in the expectation that time would unravel the my&s;|tery, and bani&s;h her unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions with the thoughts of &s;oon &s;eeing her infant.</P>
<P>The morning came. Jeanette awoke, but Wil|liam was gone. On the day of their departure &s;o many things were to be arranged, that at fir&s;t &s;he was not &s;urpri&s;ed. She leaped out of bed, and went into the adjoining room, to awake Babet, and began very bu&s;ily to pack up her baggage.</P>
<P>Breakfa&s;t was brought up, and with it the waiter delivered her a &s;ealed letter. She glanced over it, and turned pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;the addre&s;s was William's hand|writing. With trembling hands &s;he ha&s;tily broke the &s;eal, and read as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="035693_0278_100646CC537FCA70">"My deare&s;t wife! it is not in my power to re|turn with you. I am bound by my word of hon|or, and I mu&s;t perform it. For the &s;ake of my comrades who &s;till remain in captivity, I mu&s;t not abu&s;e the indulgence for which we pledged our honor. Be ea&s;y, however. I do not intend to deliver my&s;elf up to the frantic deluded people. There are &s;till in France men of worth, who will protect me till the expected exchange takes place. Be not offended at the &s;tep I have thus taken. I am indeed a husband and a father, but I am like|wi&s;e a citizen and a &s;oldier. I cannot appear in my native land as a di&s;honored run-away. I can|not enjoy happine&s;s in your arms if I violate my word. If my joyful pre&s;ages do not deceive me, we &s;hall &s;oon meet again. Proceed in your journey&mdash; may it be happy! Carry my ble&s;&s;ing to our child. I leave you far from the theatre of war, and your road home is quite &s;ecure. You have an amiable companion, a faithful &s;ervant, and more money than you will require. I am ea&s;y there|fore. Proceed on your journey, then, this very day. Every thing is ready. Forbear all fruitle&s;s attempts to di&s;cover me. When you receive this letter I &s;hall be upon the territories of France. Take the &s;horte&s;t way home&mdash;do not plunge your|&s;elf into new dangers; think of our de&s;erted child. Heaven guide you, and &s;horten our &s;eparation!"</P>
<P>To &s;ee a thunderbolt from the unclouded &s;ky &s;ud|denly &s;hiver to pieces the lofty oak by his &s;ide, would le&s;s a&s;toni&s;h the affrighted traveller than this letter amazed Jeanette. Pale and trembling &s;he handed the letter to Babet. "Ah! William, William, what ha&s;t thou done?&mdash;You are going to a land where the laws of nations afford no pro|tection&mdash;to a land where noble &s;entiments are de&s;|pi&s;ed, where the few who yet are animated by prin|ciples of humanity, mu&s;t bend under the iron rod of

tyranny; and can I then be ea&s;y?&mdash;A thou&s;and dangers have I defied&mdash;through difficulties innu|merable, through frightful precipices did I pre&s;s to find thee&mdash;yet again you abandon me!&mdash;Ah! William, what ha&s;t thou done?"</P>
<P>Thus did &s;he lament under the heavy load of her angui&s;h, and was inacce&s;&s;ible to the cold con&s;ola|tions of her friend. Her &s;pirits quite exhau&s;ted, unable to turn her attention to any object, &s;he did uncon&s;ciou&s;ly whatever &s;he was de&s;ired; con&s;ent|ed, without being &s;en&s;ible of what &s;he did, to Ba|bet's reque&s;t that they &s;hould leave this melancho|ly &s;pot. She followed her into the carriage, &s;eated her&s;elf in &s;ilence, and neither a&s;ked nor cared whither they were going.</P>
<P>When &s;he began again to breathe her native air, when they pa&s;&s;ed the frontiers of Germany, Babet &s;ucceeded in rou&s;ing her from her &s;tupor, by re|minding her of her child. At la&s;t, when they had advanced within a day's journey of the place of their de&s;tination, the feelings of the wife yielded to tho&s;e of the mother; her imagina|tion painted the little &s;miling William &s;tretching out his arms to her. She calculated in idea how much he had grown; &s;he heard the new words he had learnt to li&s;p, and rejoiced in the thought that in &s;pite of her long ab&s;ence he would &s;till know his mother.</P>
<P>It was evening when they reached a little town only two &s;hort &s;tages from the object of her tender anxiety. As they had pur&s;ued their journey day and night without repo&s;e, the wearied Babet here wi&s;hed to enjoy a few hours &s;leep; and in this wi&s;h &s;he was confirmed by the repre&s;entations of the landlord, who told them that there was a wood in their way, through which it was very un&s;afe to pa&s;s. "A de&s;perate band," &s;aid he, "con&s;i&s;ting of Ger|man de&s;erters, Dutch run-aways, and French re|fugees,

have collected here, and render travelling very dangerous. The neighborhood of the fron|tiers favor their de&s;igns. Dreadful &s;tories of rob|bery and murder are circulated, which perhaps may be exaggerated, but yet are terrible enough if you believe only one half of them. Government, it is &s;aid, however, is making preparations to put an end to the di&s;order, and a &s;trong party of &s;ol|diers is to be &s;ent to &s;urround the wood, and hunt the robbers from their retreats." Whether the detachment had yet arrived, whether the at|tempt had yet been made to clear the wood, and with what &s;ucce&s;s, the landlord could not tell, and he thought it very dangerous, for the travellers to proceed, e&s;pecially by night.</P>
<P>The tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rous Babet agreed with the ho&s;t, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of William's recommendation to expo&s;e her&s;elf to no new dangers. Maternal anxiety, however, overcame every apprehen&s;ion; for a mother's love knows no fear. Jeanette had formed to her&s;elf &s;o delightful an idea of embra|cing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> day-break, her &s;leeping babe&mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t was clear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oon-&s;ight&mdash;and the ho&s;t him&s;elf had confe&s;&s;ed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions were taken by government for the &s;afety of travellers.

In a word, her maternal anxiety overcame the fears of her friend, and, lighted by the ri&s;ing moon, they proceeded on their journey.</P>
<P>Their confidence was increa&s;ed, when at the di&s;tance of half a mile from the fatal wood they met a traveller on hor&s;e-back, who had rode through it unmole&s;ted, and who communicated to them the agreeable intelligence, that in the morning two companies of gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">diers had been drawn out, and had inve&s;ted the wood on every &s;ide.</P>

<P>IT would be an intere&s;ting &s;ubject for the cu|rious in the phenomena of the human mind, to inve&s;tigate why the &s;oul expands it&s;elf in open and luminous &s;ituations, and the flame of courage burns then more bright; why, on the contrary, in the gloomy rece&s;&s;es of rocky cliff, or the ob&s;cu|rity of a &s;haggy wood, the brea&s;t &s;eems contracted, and the frame is agitated by an involuntary horror.</P>
<P>As long as the road &s;tretched through cultiva|ted fields, and here and there the village dog was heard to bark, the travellers felt no apprehen&s;ion. When the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l wood, however, blacker and black|er, &s;kirted the horizon before them; when they began to enter upon it, and the &s;olitary trees grad|ually thickened into an impenetrable grove, through which the beams of the moon could not pa&s;s, they began to conceive &s;ome degree of alarm. An anxious &s;ilence prevailed in the carriage&mdash;every accidental ru&s;tling among the leaves, every de|ceitful &s;hadow of the trees, &s;truck them with di&s;may.</P>
<P>At little intervals the wood &s;ometimes opened, and di&s;played little &s;pots, on which the gentle light of the moon &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e unclouded.

had &s;he &s;aid this, however, when a &s;hrill whi&s;tle from a thicket on their left hand &s;ounded &s;o fright|fully through the &s;ilence of night, that they &s;tarted up. The &s;ignal was repeated at a little di&s;tance before them in the &s;ame &s;hri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l note, and imme|diately they heard the trampling of hor&s;es, and the &s;ound of human voices.</P>
<P>"God protect us!" &s;aid the po&s;tillion, and cro&s;|&s;ed him&s;elf. In trembling broken accents Jeanette endeavored to comfort her companion with the hope that perhaps it was the grenadiers who were in &s;earch of the robbers, and who guarded the road. But at this moment a &s;hot which levelled the po&s;t-boy confirmed all their fears. The carriage was &s;urrounded, and the ladies &s;creamed for help. One of the robbers mounted upon a &s;tately charger ad|vanced to the door with a pi&s;tol in his hand; he &s;poke to them in French, and ordered them, as they prized their lives, to ob&s;erve a &s;trict &s;ilence. One of his companions pulled down Peter from the coach-box; another leaped into the &s;addle, and drove the carriage into the wood. The robbers &s;urrounded it on all &s;ides; two of them &s;tood behind, and one rode before, to guide it through the rough, unformed path.</P>
<P>Scarcely had they advanced two hundred paces, when the carriage &s;truck violently again&s;t &s;ome f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lled timber, and broke the axle-tree. The rob|bers &s;wore; the ladies trembled; nothing remained to be done but to take the animate as well as inan|imate booty out of the carriage, and leave it. This the robbers in&s;tantly re&s;olved to do; twenty hands were employed in removing the baggage; and the per&s;on on hor&s;eback, who appeared the command|er of the gang, came up and politely reque&s;ted the ladies to di&s;mount. They were obliged to obey.</P>
<P>He immediately quitted them again to &s;uperin|tend his companions, and to ha&s;ten the bu&s;ine&s;s.

Jeanette and Babet &s;at down upon the mo&s;&s;y &s;tump of a tree, and were obliged to look on and &s;ee their little property thrown about and plundered. Mo&s;t of it was heaped upon poor Peter's &s;houlders, and when he groaned under the burden, they &s;timulated him with la&s;hes. In a very few minutes the rob|bers had emptied the carriage, and &s;haken the lining to &s;ee whether any thing was concealed.</P>
<P>They immediately put the cav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade in motion, and the ladies at fir&s;t believed that the robbers would content them&s;elves with the booty, and leave them behind in the wood, as nobody &s;eemed to take any concern about them. Their &s;ituation was &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, that the frightful alternative of re|maining alone in the heart of the pathle&s;s wood &s;eemed preferable, and Jeanette in &s;ecret breathed a fervent prayer that they might be left; for a mo|ther can find her way through a wilderne&s;s to her child. Of this wretched hope, however, they were deprived. Two &s;addled hor&s;es were brought, and a &s;ignal was made that they &s;hould mount and follow the re&s;t of the party as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>They declined with abundance of tears, and both declared that they had never in their lives been on hor&s;eback; that they would rather follow on foot; but their intreaties were fruitle&s;s. A dozen of rude fellows &s;urrounded them, and with coar&s;e je&s;ts promi&s;ed to take care and keep them from falling. When the ladies &s;till refu&s;ed, they &s;eized them rudely, and placed them on hor&s;eback by force.</P>
<P>At this moment a volley of mu&s;ket &s;hot poured in among them&punc; the balls whi&s;tled about Jeanette's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars. Two of the robbers who &s;tood be&s;ide her fell dead; others &s;everely wounded crept away deeper into the thicket.</P>
<P>The whole wood &s;eemed &s;uddenly to be anima|ted. Thundering cries re&s;ounded through the trees. "<HI>This way! this way!</HI>' cried a man on

hor&s;eback, who cut his way through the bu&s;hes with his &s;abre. Behind him grenadiers' caps glanced in the light of the moon.</P>
<P>The robbers who had gone before, threw down their booty when they heard the firing, &s;eized their arms, and a&s;&s;embled courageou&s;ly round their lead|er, who boldly advanced to meet the &s;oldiers. A furious engagement began, which was rendered &s;till more dreadful by the darkne&s;s of the night, and the narrow &s;pace within which the combatants were confined. Jeanette and her companion were almo&s;t as much expo&s;ed to danger as tho&s;e engaged. They attempted to fly, but on all &s;ides they were &s;urrounded by the &s;anguinary conflict. Balls &s;truck the trees by their &s;ide, and wounded men dropped down at their feet.</P>
<P>The robbers exceeded the &s;oldiers in number, and the latter began to retreat, &s;till maintaining a run|ning fight. By this movement the ladies were in|volved in the middle of the crowd. The officer who commanded them was wounded. His hor&s;e received a &s;hot, and reeled&mdash;he leaped to the ground ju&s;t be&s;ide Babet, who lay trembling on her knees, and with a &s;igh &s;tammered the words, "I can do no more!"</P>
<P>"My God!" exclaimed Babet as &s;he wrung her hands, and threw her tearful eyes to heaven. At the&s;e words, the wounded man looked up, &s;creamed "Babet! Babet!" and plunged anew into the bat|tle. That &s;weet name &s;eemed in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to have clo&s;ed his wounds, and manned his arms with &s;upernatural &s;trength. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is &s;word &s;la&s;hed de&s;truc|tion among the rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at la&s;t he reached their valiant leader, with whom he maintained an une|qual combat.

<P>Alas! he was again driven back to Babet's feet&mdash; covered with new wounds he &s;unk down be&s;ide her, and exclaimed, "Here will I die with plea|&s;ure!"&mdash;The &s;tranger was bending forwards to cleave his head, when the &s;ight of Babet again &s;eem|ed to be endued with an inexplicable charm. "Babet!" cried the robber, and his uplifted arm dropped nervele&s;s. "Babet!" repeated he; then leaped ha&s;tily from his hor&s;e, &s;eized the kneeling maid, and hurried her through the crowd deeper into the thicket. The officer lay unable to move, or to make the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition to this attempt.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. THE DELIVERER.</HEAD>
<P>SCARCELY had Babet thus, without her con|&s;ent, quitted the &s;pot where robbers and &s;ol|diers contended with equal courage and doubtful fortune, when the &s;cene &s;uddenly changed. An officer at the head of twenty hu&s;&s;ars &s;tarted &s;ud|denly from the thicket, fell like thunder upon the robbers, and in a moment decided the victory. All that were able to fly took to &s;light. The place was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> with killed and wounded. Tho&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> attempt to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re taken pri&s;oners, were bound.</P>
<P>The officer leaped from his hor&s;e, ha&s;tily traver|&s;ed

the field of battle, found Jeanette, who lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s under an oak, and threw him&s;elf down be&s;ide her.&mdash;She &s;ighed&mdash;&s;he opened her eyes, and found her&s;elf in William's arms!</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hment and joy deprived her of &s;peech. She could not a&s;k what miracle had &s;ent her hu&s;|band as her deliverer. She could only feel an un|&s;peakable joy, and this feeling venting it&s;elf in tears, &s;he hung on his neck and wept.</P>
<P>The groans of a wounded man attracted his attention, and rou&s;ed William from the delightful tran&s;ports into which he was thrown. He looked round, &s;aw a man lying weltering in his blood&mdash;looked again&mdash;&s;tarted with affright&mdash;and &s;unk down overpowered with grief by the &s;ide of the &s;ufferer.&mdash;It was Frederick&mdash;his friend, who knew him not; for the night of death &s;at heavy on his eyes.</P>
<P>"Help! help!" cried William with great emo|tion, and pulled ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his handkerchief to bind up the wounds, which bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d violently. Jeanette, too, came up and uttered a piercing &s;hriek, when &s;he recogni&s;ed the pale countenance of the gallant youth.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit of the robbers, returned, and ha&s;tily made up two litters of twigs; gently placed the wounded man upon the one, and the exhau&s;ted Jeanette upon the other, and bore them with cautious &s;teps through the wood. The hu&s;&s;ars drove the pri&s;oners before them. William rode &s;lowly be&s;ide the litters, and a thou&s;and conflicting emotions agitated his brea&s;t. When he looked at the wife he had &s;aved from &s;uch danger, he was filled with a melancholy joy; but when he turned to his dying friend, and heard Jeanette's lamentations for the lo&s;t Babet his plea|&s;ure in being the deliverer of his wife was cruelly embittered.</P>
<P>At day-break they reached the extremity of the
<PB N="289" REF="035693_0287_100646E8AAA38700">
wood, and with it a village; where, though de&s;|titute of every accommodation, they were obliged to remain, for the wounded man could not endure to be moved any farther. William immediately di&s;patched a hu&s;&s;ar to the next town to call &s;ur|geons. They came about noon, and to William's un&s;peakable joy declared that none of his friend's wounds were mortal. They pledged them&s;elves for his recovery, and &s;aid, that the only dangerous circum&s;tance was the weakne&s;s which the lo&s;s of &s;o much blood ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>The par&s;on of the pari&s;h, a benevolent old man, now came to the inn, and with the kinde&s;t ho&s;pita|lity made an offer of his hou&s;e for the accommoda|tion of the patient. The offer was gratefully ac|cepted, and Frederick, after the fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ing was taken off, with permi&s;&s;ion of the &s;urgeon was re|moved. The good old man prepared the be&s;t and quiete&s;t room in the hou&s;e for his reception; and with the mo&s;t tender anxiety produced whatever his kitchen, his cellar, and his little dome&s;tic med|icine che&s;t could furni&s;h.</P>
<P>In the evening Frederick again became perfectly &s;en&s;ible. He could not &s;peak, however, but he &s;miled complacently when he &s;aw his friend &s;itting at his bed-&s;ide. He &s;miled, too, when he &s;aw Jeanette bu&s;ied going backwards and forwards; and his eye glanced with looks of anxiety round the room, as if he &s;till &s;ought another object. William under&s;tood this look, and with a &s;ignificant ge&s;|ture a&s;ked his wife, whether Babet was yet a&s;leep: Jeanette nodded a&s;&s;ent, but &s;he was forced to turn a&s;ide to conceal the ri&s;ing tear. This little decep|tion produced an happy effect upon Frederick; he &s;eemed to be perfectly &s;atisfied, and &s;oon after fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>By the fatigues of her journey, and the terrors &s;he had &s;u&s;tained the preceding night, Jeanette
<PB N="290" REF="035693_0288_10064D34C9C2C780">
was &s;o exhau&s;ted that &s;he was &s;carce able to move. William was almo&s;t as much worn out; but he re|&s;olved this night to watch by his friend's bed-&s;ide, and in&s;i&s;ted that his wife &s;hould return and enjoy the repo&s;e &s;he &s;o much required in the adjoining room. One of the &s;urgeons likewi&s;e remained with Fre|derick. As the patient, however, &s;eemed to &s;leep quietly, the &s;urgeon fell a&s;leep al&s;o. William con|tinued awake; and the remembrance of all his wonderful adventures furni&s;hed his mind with &s;uch copious &s;ubject of meditation, as enabled him to re&s;i&s;t the attacks of &s;leep.</P>
<P>A little after midnight he heard repeated knocks at the door; but as the room where the &s;ick man lodged was at the back of the hou&s;e, and the knock|ing could not di&s;turb the repo&s;e of his friend, he took no further notice of it. In a &s;hort time, how|ever, his attention was attracted by the noi&s;e in|crea&s;ing, by the &s;ound of people pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;|&s;ing, and talking at a di&s;tance. Not long after, &s;ome one &s;tepped up to the door of the room, and knocked &s;oftly. William went out, and found the par&s;on with a light in his hand, who told him that a beautiful young lady with a ca&s;ket under her arm had come to his hou&s;e on foot, and had called him up to &s;peak with him. As &s;he, however &s;poke nothing but French, and he did not under&s;tand that language, he had conducted her to his clo&s;et, and taken the liberty to call him as an interpreter. The lady appeared very unea&s;y, and was bathed in tears.</P>
<P>William ha&s;tened to awake the &s;urgeon, and fol|lowed the old man with a pre&s;entiment which did not deceive him; for, when the door opened, Babet flew into his arms!&mdash;William's unexpected ap|pearance gave her extreme joy a tinctu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of wild|ne&s;s. She now con&s;idered her&s;elf completely &s;av|ed when &s;he found her&s;elf again under the protec|tion
<PB N="291" REF="035693_0289_10064D3664C15510">
of a beloved friend. She laughed, wept, &s;igh|ed, prayed, and for a long time could not utter a coherent &s;entence. At la&s;t &s;he inquired fir&s;t for Jeanette&mdash;and then, with vi&s;ible emotion, for Fre|derick, whom, in the confu&s;ion of the &s;ight, &s;he had too well recogni&s;ed when he dropped at her feet, and his la&s;t words, "Here will I die with plea|&s;ure!" &s;till vibrated in her ears.</P>
<P>After William had given her a favorable an&s;wer to all her inquiries, and had &s;omewhat &s;ettled her &s;pirits by a compo&s;ing draught, he expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to know by what lucky adventure &s;he had &s;o unexpectedly appeared:&mdash;Babet, however, laid her fingers on her mouth&mdash;&s;he remained &s;ilent&mdash; her eyes lo&s;t their fire&mdash;and, after taking two or three turns through the room, &s;he &s;eized William's hand, and intreated him never again to di&s;tre&s;s her with this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>William could not comprehend the cau&s;e of this refu&s;al; but as &s;he repeated her intreaty in the mo&s;t fervent tone, and he was not accu&s;tomed to pry into oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r people's &s;ecrets, he de&s;i&s;ted from all inquiry. The par&s;on, too, could give no clue to the my&s;tery. The &s;ervant could only tell that when Babet knocked, a carriage, &s;urrounded by &s;everal men on hor&s;eback, &s;tood at a little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e; and that as &s;oon as the door was opened, and &s;he admitted, the carriage and the at|tendants wheeled round, at full gallop took the way back to the wood.</P>
<P>Next morning the joy of the company was com|pleted by the appearance of hone&s;t Peter, about whom, in the fir&s;t alarm of the &s;ight, nobody had &s;hown any concern; and availing him&s;elf of this circum&s;tance, he had fled with the baggage on his back into the th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ke&s;t part of the wood The whole day he had wandered about the wood, and was almo&s;t &s;tarved, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at la&s;t a good-natured pea&s;ant

brought him into the road. He then traced out his ma&s;ter, and arrived ju&s;t at the moment when, on the removal of the &s;econd dre&s;&s;ing, the &s;urgeon gave the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of Frederick's &s;peedy recovery, and Babet and Jeanette &s;tood arm in arm by his bed-&s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>FOR an author to con&s;ider all his readers to be per&s;ons of the dulle&s;t intellects, and there|fore to leave them nothing to anticipate, or to &s;up|ply, would be no le&s;s ab&s;urd and injudicious than it would be in the manager of a theatre, who, after dropping the curtain on the conclu&s;ion of a grand &s;cenic opera, &s;hould draw it up once more to ex|hibit to the &s;pectators the whole mechani&s;m of the metamorpho&s;es, and to &s;how them every contri|vance by which the various objects were repre|&s;ented.</P>
<P>The narrator of this &s;urpri&s;ing but true hi&s;tory is convinced that mo&s;t of his readers, particularly tho&s;e of the fair &s;ex, (whom, from his own expe|rience, he knows to po&s;&s;e&s;s a peculiar felicity of conjecture, in proof of which they are much quick|er of comprehen&s;ion than men) mu&s;t long &s;ince have penetrated into the contents of the two la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, and anticipated the cata&s;trophe.

<PB N="293" REF="035693_0291_10064D3D11813380">
route of navigators, that the reader may follow them till he traces our heroes into the haven of Love, con&s;tant through every trial.</P>
<P>That Frederick, &s;oon after his &s;eparation from his friend, was exchanged; that he returned to his regiment, which during the war had &s;uffered very much, and which, partly to allow it a re&s;pite, and partly that it might be recruited to its full comple|ment, was &s;tationed in its old garri&s;on; that the young hero, accu&s;tomed to activity, undertook the ta&s;k of clearing the wood of the robbers by whom it was infe&s;ted; are circum&s;tances extremely natu|ral, and unnece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;i&s;ted upon.</P>
<P>William's elopement was the effect of, perhaps, too nice a feeling of honor, and his &s;peedy return was the effect of a proper di&s;play of genero&s;ity in the enemy. When he arrived at the head-quarters of the general, who was encamped on the frontiers of Switzerland, he voluntarily &s;urrendered him&s;elf as a pri&s;oner of war, and, with the noble candour which te&s;tifies the innocent man, recounted the &s;tory of his flight. The commander in chief did not think it his duty again to expo&s;e the life of the pri&s;oner to the fury of his countrymen, by detain|ing him. He joyfully &s;eized the opportunity which his office of intendant of the exchange of pri&s;oners pre&s;ented, to re&s;cue William from all farther in|conveniences, and that very evening he gave him liberty to return home.</P>
<P>What u&s;e William made of his freedom it is ea&s;y to conceive. He flew back to the place where he had left his faithful Jeanette with the hope of &s;till finding her there. When he found that &s;he had got the &s;tart of him by twenty miles, he took po&s;t-hor&s;es, and followed her. Every moment the di&s;tance by which they were &s;eparated dimin|i&s;hed. The la&s;t &s;tage he reached an hour after her departure, and the timorous ho&s;t told him how
<PB N="294" REF="035693_0292_10064D3EA21EECA0">
he had warned her not to proceed; and that in &s;pite of his friendly remon&s;trances, and Babet's fatigue, &s;he had re&s;olved to continue her journey.</P>
<P>William trembled to think of the danger in which &s;he was involved by her maternal anxiety. He ha&s;tened to the commandant of the place, an old fellow-&s;oldier, and reque&s;ted a &s;trong e&s;cort to the next &s;tage. Twenty hu&s;&s;ars immediately re|ceived orders to attend him, and he &s;et off full&s;peed. The tumult in the wood reached his ear, and he arrived ju&s;t in time to &s;ave his wife, and avenge his friend.</P>
<P>The thicke&s;t veil concealed the &s;ecret of Babet's adventure; and we &s;hould never have been able to penetrate it, if &s;he had not &s;ome years after, her|&s;elf communicated the my&s;tery in a moment of confidence to her husband. The captain of the rubbers, who had called her name, &s;eized and car|ried her off, was her brother Philip. In his youth &s;poiled by indulgence, perverted by the prejudices of birth, he left his country full of chimerical hopes, tru&s;ted to the di&s;tinction of his birth, and expected to perform an important part among the emigrants, for which he was not qualified. He thought him|&s;elf neglected; he then joined him&s;elf with other di&s;contented per&s;ons in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and became a robber.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time he carried on his depredations cautiou&s;ly, and with &s;ucce&s;s. But when his troop was increa&s;ed by new acce&s;&s;ions, he had the hardi|hood to engage in &s;ome extravagant attempts, which attracted the attention of government, and invol|ved him in the mo&s;t &s;erious di&s;a&s;ters. He was overpowered, his troop di&s;per&s;ed, and he had the good fortune to avoid an ignominious death by making his e&s;cape to America.</P>
<P>When in the heat of the battle he recogni&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter on her knees, a &s;park of fraternal affection
<PB N="295" REF="035693_0293_10064D4076762F38">
awoke in his brea&s;t. He forgot his own danger, and thought only of carrying the helple&s;s maid to a place of &s;afety. After the &s;kirmi&s;h was over, and the re&s;t of his troop were a&s;&s;embled, he cau&s;ed her ca&s;ket to be &s;ought for, returned it to her, and in per|&s;on conducted her by circuitous paths, known to him&s;elf alone, to the par&s;on's hou&s;e; here he pre|&s;ented her his rugged hand, which &s;he bathed with tears of &s;orrow to &s;ee him fallen &s;o low. All her &s;i&s;terly admonitions to divert him from his career of guilt&mdash;her affecting appeal to her honor|ed father's &s;pirit&mdash;he heard only in &s;ullen &s;ilence.</P>
<P>With a heavy heart, and a determination at lea&s;t not to divulge her brother's &s;hame, &s;he re&s;igned him to his fate, and ha&s;tened back to the arms of friend&s;hip, in the bo&s;om of a new family; where in per&s;on of her hu&s;band, the orphan found a fa|ther, brother, and friend.</P>
<P>Love, friend&s;hip, virtue, hope, &s;oon re&s;tored Frederick to perfect health. On William's e&s;tate the two families now grew and flouri&s;hed. Harmony, contentment, and cheerfulne&s;s beamed in the looks of their parents, and &s;miled in the eyes of their children. The two friends hung up their arms in the hall, tended their turnips and cabbages, and exclaimed with Voltaire:
<Q><L>Ah! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les &s;ages</L>
