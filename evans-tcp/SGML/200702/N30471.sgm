<HEAD>A Narrative &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AT the <HI>Great-Meadow-Fort</HI> fourteen Miles above <HI>Fort-Dummer, October</HI> 11th 1745, where I was an Inhabitant, I went out from the Fort about 50 Rods to our Wood; and when I had done, I walk'd towards the Fort, but in my Way heard the crackling of Fences behind me, &amp; turning about, &s;aw 12 or 13 Indians, with red painted Heads, running after me: On which I cry'd to God for Help, and ran, and hollow'd as I ran, to alarm the Fort; but by that I had ran ten Rods, the Indians came up with me and took hold of me: At the &s;ame Time the Men at the Fort &s;hot at the In|dians, and kill'd one on the Spot, wounded another, who died fourteen Days after he got Home, and like|wi&s;e &s;hot a Bullet thro' the Powder-Horn of one that had hold of me. They then led me into the Swamp and pinion'd me. I then committed my Ca&s;e to God, and pray'd, that &s;ince it was his Will to deliver me into the Hands of the&s;e cruel Men, I might find Favour in their Eyes: Which Reque&s;t, God of his infinite Mercy was plea&s;ed to grant; for they were generally kind to me while I was with 'em: Some of the Indians, at that Time, took the Charge of

me, others ran into the Field to kill Cattle. They led me about half a Mile; where we &s;taid in open Sight of the Fort, 'till the Indians who were killing Cattle came to us laden with Beef: Then they went a little further to a Hou&s;e, where they &s;tay'd to cut the Meat from the Bones, and cut the Helve off my Ax, and &s;tuck it into the Ground, pointing the Way we went.</P>
<P>Then we travel'd along by the River Side; and when we had got about three Miles, I e&s;pied a Canoe coming down on the further Side the River, with <HI>David Rugg</HI> and <HI>Robert Baker</HI> belonging to our Fort. I made as much Noi&s;e as I could, by Hamming &amp;c. that they might &s;ee us before the Indians &s;aw them, and &s;o get a&s;hore, and happily e&s;cape; but the Indians &s;aw them, and &s;hot a-cro&s;s the River twenty or thirty Guns at them, and kill'd the fir&s;t mention'd Per&s;on, viz <HI>David Rugg,</HI> but <HI>Robert Baker</HI> the other Per&s;on got a&s;hore, and e&s;caped. Then &s;ome of the In|dians &s;wam over the River, &amp; bro't the Canoe over the River, &s;calp'd &amp; &s;tript the dead Man, and then went about a Mile further, when we came to another Hou&s;e, where we &s;top'd; while there, we heard Men running by the Bank of the River, whom I knew to be <HI>Jonathan Thayer, Samuel Nutting,</HI> &amp; my Son <HI>Caleb How:</HI> Five of the Indians ran to head them. My Heart ak'd for them, &amp; pray'd to God to &s;ave them from the Hands of the Enemy. I &s;uppo&s;e they hid under the Bank of the River; for the Indians were gone &s;ome Time, but came back without them, ble&s;&s;ed be God.</P>
<P>We went about a Mile further, where we lodg'd that Night, and roa&s;ted the Meat they had got. The next Day we travel'd very &s;low, by Rea&s;on of the In|dian

&s;tay'd there about two Hours, when a French Gen|tleman who could &s;peak good Engli&s;h came in and told me, I mu&s;t go with him to the Governour; which I did; and after an&s;wering to a great many Que&s;ti|ons, and treated with as much Bread &amp; Wine as I de&s;ir'd, I was &s;ent with an Officer to the Guard Hou&s;e, and led into a &s;mall Room, where was an Engli&s;h-Man named <HI>William Stroud,</HI> a Kin&s;man of the Hon.

<P>After this we were &s;ent to Pri&s;on, where I found one <HI>James Kinlade,</HI> who was taken 14 Days before I was, at <HI>Sheep&s;cot</HI> at the Ea&s;tward in <HI>New-England:</HI> I was much plea&s;ed with his Conver&s;ation, e&s;teeming him a Man of true Piety: We were kept in Pri&s;on eight Days, with Liberty to keep in the Room with the Pri&s;on-keeper. We were daily vi&s;ited by Gen|tlemen and Ladies, who &s;hew'd us great Kindne&s;s, in giving us Money and other Things, and a plea&s;ant Behaviour towards us; ble&s;&s;ed be God therefor, for I de&s;ire to a&s;cribe all the Favours I have been the Partaker of ever &s;ince my Captivity, to the abun|dant Grace &amp; Goodne&s;s of a bountiful God, as the fir&s;t Cau&s;e.</P>

We had two large Stoves in it, &amp; Wood enough, &s;o that we could keep our &s;elves warm in the colde&s;t Weather. We had Provi&s;ion &s;ufficient, viz. two Pound of good Wheat Bread, one Pound of Beef, and Peas an&s;werable, to each Man ready dre&s;s'd every Day.</P>
<P>When I had been there a few Days the Captives de&s;ir'd me to lead them in carrying on Morning and Evening Devotion, which I was willing to do: We had a Bible, a P&s;alm-Book, and &s;ome other good Books; our con&s;tant Practice was to read a Chapter in the Bible, and &s;ing Part of a P&s;alm, and to pray, Night and Morning.</P>
<P>When I was at the fir&s;t Pri&s;on I was &s;tript of all my old and lou&s;ey Cloaths, and had other Cloathing given me from Head to Foot, and had many Kind|ne&s;&s;es &s;hewn me by tho&s;e that liv'd thereabouts, more e&s;pecially by one Mr. <HI>Corby</HI> and his Wife, who gave me Money there, and brought me many good Things at the other Pri&s;on.

<P>About a Fortnight after, a Dutchman was bro't to Pri&s;on, who was one of the Captives the &s;aid Ar|my had taken; he told me they had burnt Mr. <HI>Ly|dius</HI>'s Fort, and all the Hou&s;es at that new Town&s;hip and had kill'd Capt. <HI>Schyler</HI> and five or &s;ix more, and had brought 50 Whites and about 60 Negroes to <HI>Montreal:</HI> I was &s;orry to hear of &s;o much Mi&s;chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> done, but rejoyc'd they had not been upon our River and the Towns thereabouts; for which I gave Thanks to God for his great Goodne&s;s in pre&s;erving them, and particularly my Family.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;tmas came, the Governour &s;ent us 24 Livres; the Lord-Intendant came into the Pri&s;on and gave us 24 Livres more, which was about two Guineas: He told us he hop'd we &s;hould be &s;ent Home in a little Time; he was a plea&s;ant Gentle|man, and very kind to the Captives: Some time af|ter Mr. <HI>Shearly</HI> a Gentleman of Quality came to us, and gave to the three Sea Captains 24 Livres, and to me twelve, and the next Day &s;ent me a Bottle of Cla|ret Wine.

<P><HI>MAY</HI> 25 1747. This Day died M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Nehemiah How</HI> in the Ho&s;pital at <HI>Quebec</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> in the 55th Year of his Age; who had been a Cap|tive there one Year, &s;even Months, and fifteen Days: He enjoy'd his Health 'till about the middle of this Month: He was a loving Hu&s;band, and a tender Father; greatly belov'd by his Brethren and Si&s;ters, and indeed by every One who was acquainted with him: Mr. <HI>How</HI> was a Per&s;on who had behav'd him&s;elf as a Chri&s;tian from his Youth. His Death is a great Lo&s;s to his Friends; but I believe a Gain to him&s;elf; and that he is gone from a Captivity of Sorrow on Earth, to join in Songs of everla&s;ting Joy among the Ran&s;om'd of the Lord in the heavenly <HI>Zion.</HI></P>
