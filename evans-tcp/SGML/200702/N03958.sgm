<P>_THAT &s;ame Spirit of Pride and Malice, which the Phari&s;ees manife&s;ted towards our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf, whil&s;t ful|filling his Mini&s;try in the Fle&s;h, pre|vailed very much again&s;t his Church after his Death, and A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven; where|fore the Church of Chri&s;t at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was greatly oppre&s;&s;ed, and many were afraid to unite them&s;elves to it, for fear they &s;hould fall under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Rulers; and e&s;pecially were the Rich and Great unwilling to hazard their All for the Sake of Religion, &s;o that the Number of Believers con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the poorer Sort, who were not well able to &s;upport the Go&s;pel. St. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore the A|po&s;tle
<PB N="2" REF="004883_0004_100E08AF8647BE08">
to the Gentiles, endeavours to &s;tir up a Spirit of Charity among&s;t them; and tells them, <HI>they were Debtors to the Jews,</HI> and <HI>ought to give them of their carnal Things, &s;ince they had &s;o largely received of their &s;piritual Things,</HI> ver. 27. (Such was the Temper, and &s;uch the primitive Spirit in the Days of the Apo&s;tles; and would to God there was more of it handed down to us in the&s;e remote Ages.) And when the Apo&s;tle had obtained a Collection among the Gentiles, and was going up to Jeru&s;alem to de|liver the &s;ame to the Saints, he writes this Epi&s;tle from <HI>Corinth</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI>; wherein he informs the Chri&s;tians there, that when he &s;hould Journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> he purpo&s;ed to come to them, and a&s;&s;ures them he &s;hould come to them in the Fulne&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, <HI>ver.</HI> 29. And therefore he be&s;eeches them to &s;trive in Prayer for him to God. In the Words we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Duty recommended, and this is <HI>&s;triving.</HI> And he lets them know he was engaged in it him|&s;elf. <HI>Strive together with me.</HI> He does indeed tell us, 2 Tim. 2.24. <HI>That it is not lawful for a Ser|vant of the Lord to &s;trive.</HI> But there he u&s;es a diffe|rent Word <HI>(Mache&s;thai)</HI> which &s;ignifies to contend in Anger and with Weapons: But the Word here rendred <HI>&s;trive,</HI> is (<HI>Agoni&s;a&s;thai</HI>) to be in an Agony, or to agonize; and the &s;ame Word is u&s;ed, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Manner of &s;triving; and that is, in <HI>Prayer</HI>: in which we are to be in an Agony. Thus <HI>Jacob</HI> wre&s;tled in Prayer, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.24. So Chri&s;t him&s;elf was in an Agony in Prayer, <HI>Luke</HI> 22.44. And <HI>Epaphras</HI> laboured fervently in Prayer, <HI>Col.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="004883_0005_100E08B1B40C66E0">
4.12. Our Prayers &s;hould all be fervent and in|wrought Prayers.</P>
<P N="3">3. What it is the Apo&s;tle urged them thus earne&s;t|ly to &s;trive for in Prayer; and it was, that <HI>he might come unto them in the fulne&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t</HI>; that <HI>he might come to them with Joy by the Will of God, and be refre&s;hed with them,</HI> ver&s;es 29, &amp; 32.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Motives to this Duty of earne&s;t Prayer for him. And they are the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake,</HI> and <HI>the Love of the Spirit.</HI> As if the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid; be it &s;o you have no Love for me, yet if you have any De&s;ire to advance the Kingdom of your Lord; and have any De&s;ire to feel the ble&s;&s;ed In|fluences of the Spirit upon your own Hearts, and &s;ee the Operations thereof upon others, then pray for me, that my Mini&s;try may be pro&s;pered.</P>
<P>Hence the
<Q><HI>DOCT.</HI> That it greatly concerns both Mini&s;ters, and People, to unite their earne&s;t Endeavours, and mo&s;t fervent Prayers to God, that the great Ends and Purpo&s;es of the Mini&s;try may be an&s;wered.</Q></P>
<P>When our Lord had purcha&s;ed a Church here with his own Blood, and was about to a&s;cend up on high; he did not leave it comfortle&s;s; but &s;ent down his Holy Spirit, which wonderfully filled the Hearts of his People: nor did he leave his Church without Means and Helps for it's Growth and In|crea&s;e; but gave Gifts to Men, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.8. He was plea&s;ed to con&s;titute an Order of Men to teach and
<PB N="4" REF="004883_0006_100E08B34EE0CAC8">
build Men up in the Faith, and graciou&s;ly has pro|mi&s;ed them his Pre&s;ence to the End of the World.</P>
<P>Now, do we con&s;ider what their Bu&s;ine&s;s is, who it is that &s;ends them forth to it, and how they mu&s;t e're it be long, render an Account to him: how does it concern them in an e&s;pecial Manner to be fervent in Spirit &s;erving the Lord? Mankind are ready to think the Work of the Mini&s;try is an ea&s;y Employ|ment, very much freed from all Difficulties; and many have envied them their Ea&s;e; yea it is to be feared &s;ome have left their &s;ecular Employments, and turned into the Mini&s;try, that they might in|dulge greater Sloth and Idlene&s;s: But &s;uch Men are gro&s;ly ignorant of the &s;harp Conflicts &amp; &s;evere Agonies, which attend a faithful Di&s;charge of the Mini&s;try. Oftentimes Earth and Hell unite again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Wherefore a People are not to look upon them|&s;elves altogether unconcerned about the Mini&s;try; whether it be &s;ucceeded or not; but mu&s;t do all in their Power to promote the great De&s;igns of it: they mu&s;t do nothing to oppo&s;e, and hinder it them&s;elves; and when they &s;ee it labouring under Difficulties, and Oppo&s;itions, they may not &s;it &s;till, and leave Mini&s;ters to grapple with them; but mu&s;t appear for their Help, and &s;ay to them as the Peo|ple once did, to <HI>Ezra,</HI> Chap. 10.4. <HI>Ari&s;e, for this Matter belongeth unto thee; we al&s;o will be with thee, be of good Courage and do it.</HI> It is of great Concern, that a People as well as Mini&s;ters do what they can to forward the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>But in handling this Doctrine I propo&s;e,</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004883_0007_100E08B62EE93B48">Fir&s;t, <HI>To &s;how what it is that Mini&s;ters &amp; People are to endeavour after and pray earne&s;tly for.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Point out the Manner in which they are to &s;eek the Advancement of the Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Give &s;ome Rea&s;ons of the Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>Apply the Truth to Mini&s;ters and People.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, <HI>I am to &s;how what it is Mini&s;ters and People are to endeavour after and pray earne&s;tly for.</HI></P>
<P>And in general, it is the Glory of God by the Salvation of Men in the Way of the Go&s;pel. The Glory of God is the great End of our Creation, and it is what we &s;hould always aim at in our Actions. As we are Men we &s;hould endeavour &s;o to live that God may be honoured by us: and as we are Mini|&s;ters and Chri&s;tians we are e&s;pecially concerned to promote the Honour and Glory of God, by &s;eeking our own, and the Salvation of others, in that Way revealed by Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel: And in order to this,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t &s;trive and even be in an Agony, till Chri&s;t be formed in their own Souls, and the Souls of their Hearers.</HI></P>
<P>Men are not always converted when they enter into the Mini&s;try: many In&s;tances there have been of their Conver&s;ion by their own Mini&s;try. But if this be the Ca&s;e of any Mini&s;ters not to be convert|ed, how &s;hould they cry to God Day and Night for pardoning and &s;anctifying Mercy? And give no Peace to them&s;elves till they are born of the Spirit of God: <HI>le&s;t whil&s;t they preach the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t to others, they be a Ca&s;taway them&s;elves,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.27. How &s;hould they wre&s;tle in Prayer till they know the Work of God upon the Heart, and can feelingly
<PB N="6" REF="004883_0008_100E08B7B3A3ECC8">
pitty, and travail in Birth with others? And when this happy Change is effected in their own Souls; how &s;hould they &s;trive and agonize in Prayer <HI>till Chri&s;t be formed in the Souls of their Hearers?</HI> Gal. 4.19.</P>
<P>And if Mini&s;ters have ever felt the Terrors of the Law, and experienced the Comforts of God's Spirit, they can't be ea&s;y till their People are bro't out of a State of Sin and Death into the Favour of God, they will not re&s;t till they have re&s;cued them from the Hands of the Devil, and introduced them into the Kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Mini|&s;ters mu&s;t take much Pains for the Conver&s;ion of their Hearers; and e&s;pecially if at any Time they perceive a good Work begun in their Souls: they &s;hould never give over till it end in a thoro' Con|ver&s;ion to God.</P>
<P>And at the &s;ame Time that Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;|pel are travailing in Birth for their own and the Souls of others, a People mu&s;t join with them and pray earne&s;tly for them. <HI>Have any of you an unconverted Mini&s;ter, you may not reject him even for that; you have no &s;uch Warrant from the Word of God; to do this would be to impeach the Wi&s;dom of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, who commanded the Hearers to ob&s;erve and do all that the Scribes and Phari&s;ees taught them.</HI> Mat. 23.2, 3. <HI>And it would be to make your &s;elves wi&s;er than the Wi&s;dom of God, who cho&s;e one to the Apo&s;tle&s;hip whom he knew was in a State of Nature; and at that very Time fore&s;aw he would lift up his Heel again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P>Your Duty in &s;uch a Ca&s;e is to pray earne&s;tly to God for him; that he may be made of God a faith|ful
<PB N="7" REF="004883_0009_100E08B9E7B2FAA8">
experimental Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And is your Mini&s;ter labouring for the Conver&s;ion of you or yours, can you neglect &s;triving with him, 'till &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed Work be effected in you?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Mini&s;ters and People are unitedly to endeavour to uphold and promote real Piety and Godline&s;s among them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t &s;trive to be exemplary them&s;elves, to be Patterns of Patience, Holine&s;s and heavenly Mindedne&s;s; they mu&s;t re&s;i&s;t all Temptations to Lewdne&s;s and Vanity. It is a great Reproach to Religion when Men, who bear the Character of Chri&s;t's Amba&s;&s;adors, give them&s;elves up to Sen|&s;uality, and have no Government over their Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites. But this has been unhappily &s;ome|times the Ca&s;e to the great Di&s;honour of Chri&s;t. Would we be Mini&s;ters of our a&s;cended Lord and glorified Redeemer, we mu&s;t avoid every Thing, which tends to bring our &s;elves and his Doctrines into Contempt.</P>
<P>And all &s;uch as profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians mu&s;t be very watchful over them&s;elves, and <HI>walk circum|&s;pectly, not as Fools but as Wi&s;e, redeeming the Time,</HI> Eph. 5.15, 16. They mu&s;t avoid all Appearances of Evil, and live up to the Character they &s;u&s;tain. Nor is it enough here, that Mini&s;ters and People are externally &s;ober and religious; but they mu&s;t keep up the <HI>Life and Power of Godline&s;s, as well as the Form of it,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.5.</P>
<P>And do Mini&s;ters and People at any Time ob|&s;erve Religion dying, how &s;hould they &s;trive toge|ther, to revive it? Is any Sin prevailing and grow|ing rampant; they mu&s;t awake to put a Stop to it,
<PB N="8" REF="004883_0010_100E08BC05266F88">
and face it down: It is not enough that Mini&s;ters exert them&s;elves; but a People mu&s;t al&s;o join their &s;tronge&s;t Endeavours and mo&s;t &s;ervent Prayers: they mu&s;t &s;trengthen the Hands, and encourage the Hearts of Mini&s;ters; as they in <HI>Ezra</HI> 10.4. <HI>forecited.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Mini&s;ters and People are concerned to do all in them lies to pre&s;erve Peace and good Order among&s;t them&s;elves.</HI> Chri&s;t's Ble&s;&s;ing to his Church was <HI>Peace.</HI> Joh. 14.27. And the Go&s;pel often enjoins Peace upon the Followers of Chri&s;t. Hence we are commanded <HI>to live peaceably as much as po&s;&s;ible,</HI> Rom. 12.18. and to <HI>follow the Things which make for Peace,</HI> Rom. 14.19. And Peace among&s;t a Peo|ple is very nece&s;&s;ary in order to the flouri&s;hing of Reli|gion: The Spirit of God will not dwell in the mid&s;t of War and Contention. How watchful therefore &s;hould Mini&s;ters and People be that they don't fall into Strifes and Animo&s;ities? Satan is always ready to ca&s;t in Bones of Contention: Mini&s;ters mu&s;t &s;trive &s;o to live that they may give none Offence to any; and that Satan may have nothing to improve again&s;t them to de&s;troy their U&s;efulne&s;s: And a People mu&s;t avoid all Occa&s;ions of Contention, by living in Love, by bearing with, and forgiving one ano|ther. And is any Feud &s;pringing up, how does it concern us all to quench the Coals?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Mini&s;ters and People mu&s;t unite their Endeavours and Prayers that the Doctrines of Chri&s;t may be pre|&s;erved pure and unmixed with Errors.</HI> We are all bound <HI>earne&s;tly to contend for the Faith,</HI> Jude 3. And e&s;pecially &s;hould it be of a great Concern to &s;uch, as are appointed to teach the Truth to others, to be well grounded them&s;elves in the Truth. Mini|&s;ters
<PB N="9" REF="004883_0011_100E08BF01A883C8">
may not indifferently embrace any Tenets; thinking it no Matter &s;o their People are ea&s;y with them; but they mu&s;t examine the Truth, and when they are well in&s;tructed in it, mu&s;t teach it to others: and they are commanded <HI>to convince Gain&s;ayers,</HI> Tit. 1.9. And is any Here&s;y &s;pringing up at any Time, they mu&s;t make a vigorous Oppo&s;ition; and a People mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t them herein, le&s;t the Corruption become epidemical, and prove fatal to the Souls of many.</P>
<P><HI>So al&s;o it equally concerns Mini&s;ters &amp; People to pre|&s;erve the Wor&s;hip of God unmixed with the Inventions and Super&s;titions of Men. Mo&s;es</HI> in building the Ta|bernacle, was to follow exactly the Pattern &s;hewn him in the Mount: So we in all our Wor&s;hip &s;hould pattern after the Mind of God revealed in his Word. We mu&s;t keep up a holy Jealou&s;y for God's Wor&s;hip, and be always ready to re&s;cue it from the Impo&s;itions of Men, which however plea|&s;ing they may be to carnal Rea&s;on, yet are con|demned by God, and un&s;afe for us.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Mini&s;ters and People mu&s;t do all they can to &s;up|port Chri&s;t's Authority in his Church, that his Laws and Government may take Place upon Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</HI> That Chri&s;t has left Authority in his Church is cer|tain, <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. &amp; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. In who&s;e Hands it is repo&s;ited, I &s;hall not now attempt to determine; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be decided, would Mini&s;ters and People a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;trengthen one another, and both do what in them lies to reclaim Sinners and bring them to Repentance; but &s;o long as Mini&s;ters and People are jealous of one another, and all they aim at is to engro&s;s the Power into their own Hands; and
<PB N="10" REF="004883_0012_100E08C086DE6858">
refu&s;e to &s;trengthen one another, Things will grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e if po&s;&s;ible. It is a Reproach to Chri&s;tians, that there is &s;carce &s;o much as a Shadow of Government in the Church; and it is &s;o hard a Matter to bring Offenders to humble them&s;elves: and ob&s;tinate Men cannot be brought to &s;ubmit to Order. Happy would it be, would Mini&s;ters and People unite to recover the &s;inking Authority of Chri&s;t in particular Churches; <HI>&s;ince we can't have any Help from Councils of Churches:</HI> Authority is as nece&s;&s;ary in a Church as in a Kingdom: and the more this &s;inks, the more will Religion die with it. Mi|ni&s;ters therefore mu&s;t bear a Te&s;timony again&s;t Offenders; mu&s;t boldly call them to an Account; and a People mu&s;t &s;trengthen a Mini&s;ter's Hands and encourage his Heart herein; and may not ju&s;tify the Wicked, as is too commonly the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>It concerns Mini&s;ters and People to endeavour to &s;upport the Honour and Credit of the Mini&s;try.</HI> How|ever a corrupt and degenerate Age may de&s;pi&s;e Men of a &s;acred Character; yet certainly the Work of the Mini&s;try is the mo&s;t honourable Employment in the World: and Chri&s;t a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that &s;uch as de&s;|pi&s;e them de&s;pi&s;e him,</HI> Luk. 10.16. He will have them <HI>e&s;teemed highly for their Works &s;ake,</HI> 1 The&s;. 5.13. and <HI>accounted worthy of double Honour,</HI> 1 Tim. 5.17. And when we con&s;ider how much the Suc|ce&s;s of the Mini&s;try depends upon the E&s;teem Men have of Mini&s;ters them&s;elves, &s;hall not both they and a People do all they can to advance their Credit and Reputation? They mu&s;t them&s;elves live &s;o holy and exemplary, that none may have any Rea&s;on to Cen&s;ure and Reproach them. They mu&s;t ap|prove
<PB N="11" REF="004883_0013_100E08C20D80A270">
them&s;elves to the Con&s;ciences of Men. Their Lives and Conver&s;ations mu&s;t be &s;uch as will com|mand Reverence from Men: But then Mini&s;ters are <HI>Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ubject to like Temptati|ons with other Men,</HI> Act. 14.15. And if they do any Thing incon&s;i&s;tent with their Character, and Calling; a People mu&s;t bear with their Infirmities, overlook, and cover their Failings. God has guard|ed their Reputation better than any Mens whatever, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.19. How afraid then &s;hould you be to &s;peak Evil of them, as is the common Practice of Mankind? <HI>As tho' they hired them into the Mini&s;try, to let loo&s;e reproachful Words of them?</HI> But not|with&s;tanding all the Care God has taken to pre&s;erve the Reputation of Mini&s;ters, how ready are Men to &s;pread every Failing they are guilty of to the great|e&s;t Di&s;tance? But when Mini&s;ters are thus wound|ed in their Reputations, their U&s;efulne&s;s is greatly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>And in order to <HI>your upholding the Credit of the Mini&s;try, you mu&s;t &s;upport them honourably who labour for your Souls</HI>&punc; God commanded that <HI>the Ox which treadeth out the Corn &s;hould not be muzzled,</HI> Deut. 25.4. Which the Apo&s;tle applies to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, 1 Cor. 9.9, 10. And he lets us know there is the &s;ame Rea&s;on <HI>they who preach the Go&s;pel &s;hould live of the Go&s;pel; as they who attended upon the Altar &s;hould be Partakers of the Altar,</HI> Ver&s;es 13, 14. But it is certain, the Prie&s;ts under the Law were allowed by God a va&s;tly greater Maintenance than Men are willing to allow Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel. It is a vain Imagination &s;ome Men have, that if Mi|ni&s;ters are kept poor and dependant, they will be
<PB N="12" REF="004883_0014_100E08C44F61E590">
more faithful, that they may not be rejected by the People: This is the Way to make them Servants to Mens Humours, in&s;tead of Servants to their Sal|vation; if they are kept mean and low, they will not have Courage to reprove Men boldly, and face down their darling Sins: <HI>their Strength is not the Strength of Stones, nor their Fle&s;h Bra&s;s,</HI> Job 6.12. And if they are kept poor and dependant, when Troubles ari&s;e and Men evil intreat them, they are ready to &s;ink, and know not how to per&s;i&s;t in their Work. <HI>And it is to be feared this has overborn and wa&s;ted the Spirits of &s;ome of the faithful Servants of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I am to &s;how in what <HI>Way and Manner Mini&s;ters and People are to endeavour to promote the great Ends of the Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>And the particular Way the Apo&s;tle points out to us all is <HI>Prayer:</HI> Yet we are not to &s;uppo&s;e this is the only Method Mini&s;ters and People are to u&s;e, for the Light of Nature, and the Word of God it &s;elf, will teach us to add to Prayer all rea&s;onable Means and Endeavours; but as we are intirely de|pendant upon God and Chri&s;t for our Salvation, and can do nothing of our &s;elves; &s;o nothing is more rea&s;onable than this, that we &s;hould make known all our Wants to God, and commit all our Cares to him by Prayer; He alone can pro&s;per our Endea|vours, and grant us our De&s;ires. And e&s;pecially &s;hould Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t be frequent in this Duty of Prayer; they are altogether of them&s;elves in|&s;ufficient for this Work, and <HI>all their Sufficiency is of God,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.5. And how earne&s;tly &s;hould they implore upon their Knees the compa&s;&s;ionate Pre&s;ence
<PB N="13" REF="004883_0015_100E08C682D2F620">
of their Lord, and the gracious Influences of his Spi|rit, to conduct them into the Paths of Truth, and &s;ave them from the endle&s;s Labyrinths of Error? That he would Support and Comfort them under all the great Difficulties and Di&s;couragements they meet with in their Work? How &s;hould they ago|nize in Prayer, and plead for the Influence of the Spirit in all their more private or publick Services? That both in their Studies, and in the Congrega|tion they may approve them&s;elves to God, and be faithful Mini&s;ters of the New Te&s;tament? They mu&s;t al&s;o be much in Prayer for their People; mu&s;t carry all their Ca&s;es to God. <HI>They mu&s;t confe&s;s and bewail their Sins before God, and intreat God to &s;pare them,</HI> Joel 2.17. Yea they mu&s;t do this, when God &s;eems to be ready to de&s;troy them: Mini&s;ters may not hide them&s;elves in the Day of God's An|ger. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t plead with God for all the Mercies their People want; and e&s;pecially for the Graces of his Holy Spirit upon them. <HI>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be well acquainted with the State of their Flocks,</HI> Prov. 27.23. That they may &s;uit their Prayers to their various Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><HI>And at the &s;ame Time that Mini&s;ters are thus wre&s;t|ling in Prayer, a People mu&s;t al&s;o lift up holy Hands to God, and labour earne&s;tly in Prayer for their Mini|&s;ters and them&s;elves.</HI> It is not enough that you put up &s;ome cold Petitions for your Mini&s;ters on Lord's Days; and yet perhaps this is more than many, who would be accounted Chri&s;tians, do. You mu&s;t wre&s;tle in Prayer for them, that God would be with them; direct, a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;ucceed and pro&s;per them in their Work; and this &s;hould be Matter of your daily Prayer, both in the Clo&s;et and Family; &s;o al&s;o how
<PB N="14" REF="004883_0016_100E08C8B1A9D248">
earne&s;t mu&s;t you be in Prayer for your &s;elves, that God would keep you from Sin, and guide you in the Paths of Life and Peace.</P>
<P>But as Mini&s;ters and People &s;tand in different Re|lations to one another, it concerns them to &s;trive in different Ways to forward and &s;ucceed the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, <HI>as to Mini&s;ters they mu&s;t take much Pains to be furni&s;hed with Knowledge for their Work.</HI> They <HI>mu&s;t give them&s;elves to reading, and attend continually upon the&s;e Things,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.13, <HI>&amp;</HI> 15. That they may handle the Word of God skilfully, and be <HI>Workmen that need not to be a&s;hamed,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.15. They <HI>mu&s;t convince Gain&s;ayers,</HI> Tit. 1.9. and give to every one his Portion in due Sea&s;on; which they never can do unle&s;s they are Men of Knowledge and acquainted with Learning of diver&s;e Sorts. It is in vain for Mini&s;ters to pretend they need not take Pains for their Di&s;cour&s;es; and that the Spirit of God will &s;ugge&s;t Truths while they are &s;peaking. We are not &s;o to expect the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spi|rit at the pre&s;ent Day. We mu&s;t <HI>&s;earch out accepta|ble Words,</HI> Eccl. 12.10. <HI>However Men of &s;uch a Stamp who de&s;pi&s;e humane Learning and Study may be admired and followed when Men are over heated with Zeal; it is certain they cannot la&s;t long; and in a little Time their Folly will be known to all Men; and the World will as much de&s;pi&s;e them, as now they ad|mire and care&s;s them.</HI> A Mini&s;ter may at &s;ome Times have a Call to enter into the Desk with but little previous Meditation &amp; Preparation; but always to do this, is Pre&s;umption, and inexcu&s;able Arrogance.</P>
<P>And while we are compo&s;ing our Sermons, we mu&s;t endeavour to &s;uit them to the Con&s;ciences of Men, and not to their itching Ears: We mu&s;t &s;trive
<PB N="15" REF="004883_0017_100E08CB1C304348">
for &s;uch Words as will awaken Mens Hopes and Fears, and make them engaged for the Salvation of their Souls; and not &s;tudy for poli&s;hed Words and &s;trains of Rhetorick, which will &s;oar above Mens Under&s;tandings, and make no la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion upon their Souls.</P>
<P><HI>And not only mu&s;t Mini&s;ters &s;trive to compo&s;e their Sermons well&punc; but mu&s;t take Pains in the delivery of them.</HI> I &s;hall not pretend to determine whether it ought to be with, or without reading their written Notes: I think there is much needle&s;s Di&s;pute in this Matter: and after all there is Liberty of Con&s;ci|ence. But let the Way and Manner be what it will, Mini&s;ters mu&s;t &s;peak in the Name of God, and with Authority. Their Words, their Ge&s;ture, and very Countenance mu&s;t di&s;cover them in earne&s;t for the Salvation of Souls. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t not be cold and lifele&s;s in the Desk; but &s;hould <HI>be Flames of Fire,</HI> Heb. 1.7. When they addre&s;s them&s;elves to Sinners, they mu&s;t be Sons of Thunder, de|nouncing the Terrors of the Law in &s;uch a Manner that Fear and Trembling may take hold on them. And when they &s;peak to awakened and weary Sin|ners, it mu&s;t be with &s;uch Tenderne&s;s &amp; Compa&s;&s;ion that they may be drawn to Chri&s;t for Life and Re&s;t. If Mini&s;ters are cold and lifele&s;s in their Delivery, they will make carele&s;s and dead Hearers.</P>
<P><HI>So al&s;o they mu&s;t take much Pains in their publick Prayers</HI>; and manife&s;t &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s, and &s;o &s;uit them&s;elves to the State of their Flocks, that they may command the Attention of the People. And in all their Conver&s;ation they mu&s;t endeavour &s;o to behave them&s;elves, &s;o to teach, exhort, and reprove
<PB N="16" REF="004883_0018_100E08CCCEE1EBD8" MS="y">
Men privately, that all may profit by them, as well as in their publick Mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>On the other Hand a People mu&s;t (according to the Relation they &s;tand in to Mini&s;ters) take much Pains that the Mini&s;try may be &s;ucceeded.</HI> A People mu&s;t then take due Care to attain to a &s;uitable Pre|paration of Heart to attend upon the preaching of the Word of God. <HI>You mu&s;t break up the fallow Ground of your Hearts,</HI> Jer. 4.3. That the Seed to be &s;own may be received into good Ground. If you come to the publick Wor&s;hip without any Preparation of Soul, you cannot expect to profit by what is delivered to you: It will be no more than a dead Letter. And is not this one great Rea&s;on why Multitudes have heard Thou&s;ands of Sermons, and never profited at all by them? If Hearers do not awake the Powers of their Souls with Meditation and Prayer to hear the Word preached, Mini&s;ters may ordinarily preach to dead Walls and lifele&s;s Images, to as much Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>You mu&s;t al&s;o embrace all Opportunities to hear the Word preached, and not neglect a&s;&s;embling your &s;elves together,</HI> Heb. 10.25. What will all the Study and Pains of a Mini&s;ter avail, if you will not attend upon their Mini&s;try? You mu&s;t willingly mi&s;s no Op|portunity of hearing, le&s;t you mi&s;s of &s;ome Truth that might awaken, convince, and comfort your Souls.</P>
<P><HI>And you mu&s;t strive to hear aright what is preached to you,</HI> Mar. 4.24. You mu&s;t take Pains to under|&s;tand it, and not allow your Tho'ts to wander to the Ends of the Earth; nor your &s;elves drowned in Sleep, while Truths of the greate&s;t Importance are delivered to you.</P>
<P><HI>And you mu&s;t take much Pains to trea&s;ure up in
<PB N="17" REF="004883_0019_100E08CF05904160">
your Memories; that you may pray over what you hear.</HI> It is unhappily the Ca&s;e of many Hearers, they never carry any Thing from the Hou&s;e of God&punc; But would you profit by the Mini&s;try, you mu&s;t of|ten think of what you hear, and pray over it, that God would ble&s;s it to your Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>And you mu&s;t be careful to practice what you hear from Time to Time</HI>; otherwi&s;e it will be of no Advan|tage to you, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.24,&mdash;27. Many think if they hear good Di&s;cour&s;es and commend them, they an&s;|wer their Duty; and are ea&s;y if they never put them in Practice; but the End of Hearing is to Practice: and how careful &s;hould you be to Practice what you hear, le&s;t the wicked One take it from you.</P>
<P><HI>And to &s;um up all here with re&s;pect to a People, would you &s;trive together with Mini&s;ters to promote their Mini&s;try; you mu&s;t govern your own Families.</HI> And herein you will make their Work much ea&s;ier, and more happy: Hereby you may do much towards the Peace of a Church, and flouri&s;hing of Religion; but if you are negligent in this Point, you will lay a Foundation for Rebellion &amp; Trouble in the Church. If Children are not bound to obey at Home, they will not &s;ubmit either to Mini&s;ters or Magi&s;trates. It is what God mentions of <HI>Abraham</HI> to his Honour, <HI>that he governed his Hou&s;hold,</HI> Gen&punc; 18.19. And a Want of this has been the Cau&s;e of &s;o much Trouble and Vexation to Mini&s;ters; and &s;uch a World of Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion in Church &amp; State. Would you then help and encourage Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, you mu&s;t train up your Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Proceed we now to give &s;ome Rea&s;ons of the Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="18" REF="004883_0020_100E08D1338E3630">1. Then, <HI>when we con&s;ider how very great and noble the Ends and De&s;igns of the Mini&s;try are</HI>; it is enough to animate Mini&s;ters and People to do all they can to promote the &s;ame: Now <HI>the&s;e are no|thing &s;hort of the Glory of God, and the eternal well-being of immortal Souls.</HI> What can we better em|ploy our &s;elves about, and &s;pend our Strength for, than the&s;e? The&s;e are worthy our highe&s;t Ambition, and well de&s;erve our warme&s;t Endeavours. Can we do too much for God's Honour, or the Salvation of our own Souls? And the&s;e are what the Mini&s;try is aiming at.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The greatne&s;s and weightine&s;s of this Work of the Mini&s;try calls for the mutual Endeavours of Mini|&s;ters and People.</HI> Have Mini&s;ters &s;o much upon their Hands, and will they not be concerned to accompli&s;h the &s;ame? Can they loiter, and indulge Sloth? And have a People any Pity for Mini&s;ters, and know how great a Burden they &s;u&s;tain, can they refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t, encourage and &s;trengthen them? God com|manded his People <HI>to help even an A&s;s labouring un|der a Burden,</HI> Exod. 23.5. And can you omit bearing with Mini&s;ters, and &s;triving with them?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Succe&s;s of the Mini&s;try depends very much upon the joint Endeavours of Mini&s;ters and People to promote it.</HI> What can either Mini&s;ters or People do alone? If Mini&s;ters are zealous &amp; laborious in their Work; yet if a People remain carele&s;s &amp; &s;lothful, they will have Rea&s;on to complain they labour in vain: So, if a People are &s;triving in Prayer, and Mini&s;ters are void of Life, there will be but little Fruit: But when they both unite their Endeavours <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Prayers, there is a Pro&s;pect of a glorious Harve&s;t.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="19" REF="004883_0021_100E08D2B99418D8">4. <HI>The Con&s;ideration that Mini&s;ters are employed to advance the Kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ought to invigorate Mini&s;ters and People to u&s;e their be&s;t Endeavours to promote the Mini&s;try.</HI> If we have any Love to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has loved us to the Death, &s;hall we not &s;eek the Advancement of his Kingdom of Peace in the World? His Government is mo&s;t happy &amp; rea&s;onable: his Laws all ju&s;t and good. And &s;hall we not &s;eek to promote &s;uch a Kingdom in the World? Which the more it pre|vails, the more happy it will make Men; for <HI>his Yoke is ea&s;y, and his Burden light,</HI> Mat. 11.29, 30.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Have Mini&s;ters and People any Love to the Spi|rit of God, they will thus &s;trive together.</HI> If they have any De&s;ire to feel the ble&s;&s;ed Influences of the Spi|rit of God upon their own Hearts; or do they long to &s;ee the ble&s;&s;ed Fruits and Effects of it upon the Souls of others, they will &s;trive together herefor: The more faithful and labourious Mini&s;ters are, and the more a People &s;trive to profit, &s;o much the more is the good Spirit of God cheri&s;hed among&s;t a People: But if Mini&s;ters are unfaithful, and a Peo|ple carele&s;s and &s;lothful, they will quench the Spirit of God, and drive him from them.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of Religion in the Country require the mo&s;t vigorous Endeavours of Mi|ni&s;ters and People to &s;upport the &s;ame.</HI> God has been plea&s;ed remarkably to revive his Work in our Land: But by Rea&s;on of the Imprudence and over-heated Zeal of one Set of Men; and the Coldne&s;s and In|difference of another towards Religion; it is dying in many Parts of the Land: and we are in the ut|mo&s;t Danger of falling into the wilde&s;t Confu&s;ion in our religious Affairs. Some are ha&s;tening on the
<PB N="20" REF="004883_0022_100DEF48C2B177E8">
greate&s;t Extravagance in Religion, and others grow|ing into a Coldne&s;s and Contempt of the Work of God. And is it not now high Time for Mini&s;ters and People to u&s;e their be&s;t Endeavours to guard Religion, and &s;ave them&s;elves from the&s;e approach|ing Calamities?</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Both Mini&s;ters and People are accountable to Chri&s;t their Judge for what they do. We mu&s;t all &s;tand before the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. 14.10. And <HI>mu&s;t give an Account of our &s;elves,</HI> Ver. 12. Mini&s;ters for what they have preached, and you for what you have heard, and how you have profited by it: And what Account can we give, if we have not done our Endeavours to advance the Kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If Mini&s;ters are not faith|ful to di&s;charge their Tru&s;t, and a People don't take Care to profit under their Mini&s;try, how amazing will their Account be?</P>
<P>What remains is to apply what has been &s;aid to Mini&s;ters and People.</P>
<P>USE I. Of Information. <HI>And what you have heard &s;hews you how fal&s;ly they judge of Things, who envy Mini&s;ters their Work becau&s;e it is attended with greater Ea&s;e than other Employments.</HI> They know not what Trials and Sorrows they are exerci&s;ed with, who attend upon the Mini&s;try: While you eat and &s;leep &s;weetly, Mini&s;ters feed upon the Bread of Tears, and Sleep flies from them: They have Agonies and Struggles which the World know not of.</P>
<P><HI>So al&s;o what has been &s;aid &s;hows us what Rea&s;on both Mini&s;ters and People have for Humiliation and Self-Aba&s;ement:</HI> We have all done too little for Chri&s;t: Have not &s;trove together as we ought to
<PB N="21" REF="004883_0023_100E08D72C6BD380">
have done; the be&s;t and mo&s;t faithful Mini&s;ters have Rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed they have &s;trove no more to advance the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and the Sal|vation of Souls, and may ju&s;tly &s;ay, <HI>they have been unpro|fitable Servants,</HI> Luk. 17.10. And that People who have &s;trove mo&s;t to advance the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and the Salvation of their Souls, may ju&s;tly &s;ay, <HI>in many Things we have offended all,</HI> Jam. 3.2.</P>
<P><HI>We may al&s;o, from what has been &s;aid, account for it that the Mini&s;try is attended with no better Succe&s;s.</HI> Mini&s;ters and People don't &s;trive together, and are not &s;uitably concerned to promote Religion; would they &s;tir up them&s;elves and put their Hands to the Work, would not a merciful God do for them what they can't do them&s;elves?</P>
<P><HI>We al&s;o learn from what has been &s;aid it &s;hould be Matter of great rejoycing, when God pours out his Spirit, to both Mini&s;ters &amp; People, for now Mini&s;ters may expect much Succe&s;s in their Work, and a People hope for the Salvation of Souls.</HI> So on the other Hand, how &s;hould they mourn when God takes away his Spirit from them; for then Mini&s;ters will labour very much in vain; and a People will grow cold, and draw back in Religion.</P>
<P>USE. II. Of Direction to Mini&s;ters and People. Would they mutually &s;trive together:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let both Mini&s;ters and People endeavour to en|tertain ju&s;t Thoughts of one another.</HI> It has too often happened, becau&s;e Mini&s;ters and a People have en|tertained wrong Thoughts of each other, in a little Time they have fallen into a &s;hameful coldne&s;s and indifferency towards each other: Thus a People &s;ometimes when they call a Mini&s;ter among them,
<PB N="22" REF="004883_0024_100E08DA0C648028" MS="y">
exalt him above Mea&s;ure; and &s;carcely will allow humane Frailties in him: <HI>but this is only to prepare him for the greater Fall:</HI> Like a Pendulum, the far|ther it is &s;tretched on one &s;ide; will in its return &s;wing as far on the oppo&s;ite Side. And even &s;uch a People are commonly as ready to deba&s;e him as be|fore to exalt him. Let a People therefore look up|on their Mini&s;ter as a Man of the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions and Infirmities with them&s;elves; and expect he will fail in &s;ome Things as well as they.</P>
<P>So let a Mini&s;ter look upon his People as Men who have many Remainders of Corruption, from whom he mu&s;t expect to receive Injuries and Abu&s;es. Mi|ni&s;ters have &s;ometimes been ready to look upon their People wholly free from the&s;e Things, and when they have evilly intreated them, have been ready to &s;ink under it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let Mini&s;ters and People take pains to grow and increa&s;e in their Love for one another; and then they will &s;trive together; and will not oppo&s;e one another.</HI></P>
<P>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t love their People, as their &s;pecial Charge, who&s;e Souls they are accountable for. And if they peri&s;h thro' their Neglect, they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> an&s;wer for them to God. And let a People look upon their Mini&s;ters as &s;pecial Ble&s;&s;ings be&s;towed by Chri&s;t the great Head of the Church, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11, 12, 13. and a People ought to love them in a high Degree as &s;uch.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Would Mini&s;ters and People &s;trive together, let them learn to bear with and cover over one another's Failings.</HI> A Mini&s;ter mu&s;t be very &s;paring in &s;pread|ing abroad the Weakne&s;s or Sins of his People: and a People mu&s;t always conceal as much as
<PB N="23" REF="004883_0025_100E08DB92B84068">
po&s;&s;ible the Infirmities of their Mini&s;ters, Let not the Failings of Mini&s;ters be the Subject of your Con|ver&s;ation, and the News you carry abroad with you. A want of this mutual bearing between Mini&s;ters and People, has greatly hindred the Mini&s;try and the Salvation of Souls.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let Mini&s;ters and People make the Advancement of Religion their great Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> Both Mini&s;ters and People are too cold in the Service of Chri&s;t, by Rea|&s;on of their being too much engaged in worldly Affairs. A People think hard to &s;upport the Mini|&s;try, and do much to promote it; becau&s;e they are more concerned to promote &s;omething el&s;e. Now if the Advancement of Chri&s;t's Kingdom lies neare&s;t the Hearts of Mini&s;ters and People, they will &s;trive together.</P>
<P>USE. III. Of Motive to Mini&s;ters and People to &s;trive together. And</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us all con&s;ider how much the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has done for us.</HI> He freely undertook for our Redemption; left the Glories of Heaven, came down and dwelt in Fle&s;h: <HI>He who was rich emptied him&s;elf and became poor, that we might be made rich,</HI> 2 Cor. 8.9. He obeyed the Law which we had broke; and has paid the Debt we owed to divine Ju&s;tice. He &s;uffered the &s;hameful and cruel Death of the Cro&s;s; and is a&s;cended into Heaven, there to make Interce&s;&s;ion for Sinners: And now, can we be unwilling to do all we can for Chri&s;t, who has done &s;o much for us?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let Mini&s;ters and People con&s;ider how awful it will be to peri&s;h after they have lived under the Go&s;pel, the one preaching and the other hearing the glad Tidings
<PB N="24" REF="004883_0026_100E08DDA2D38318">
of Salvation.</HI> Barely preaching the Word of God, or hearing the Go&s;pel preached, will not intitle Men to Salvation; and many who now preach, and hear the Go&s;pel preached, will another Day hear Chri&s;t &s;ay to them, <HI>I know you not,</HI> Mat. 7.22, 23. Luk. 13.25. But can Mini&s;ters or People bear the Tho'ts of being thus di&s;owned by Chri&s;t?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Often think what Joy and Satisfaction it will yield you in the great Day of Accounts to be found to|gether at the right Hand of Chri&s;t.</HI> What Plea&s;ure will it be to Mini&s;ters to &s;ee in that Day great Num|bers of their People, whom they travailled in Birth for, &s;tanding with them at the right Hand of Chri&s;t cloathed in white Raiment. This will afford mutual and inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy to Mini&s;ters and People.</P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>Let us all keep in View the Glories of the upper World, and that un&s;peakable Reward which will be given both to Mini&s;ters and People who are faithful and &s;trive together to promote the Kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Eye has not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor can it enter into our Hearts to conceive of the great Things God has prepared for &s;uch,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.9. And both Mini&s;ters and People who &s;trive together to promote the Kingdom of Chri&s;t; and are made the happy In&s;truments of recovering Souls from Sin to God, will <HI>&s;hine as the Brightne&s;s of the Firma|ment, and as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI></P>

<P>WHEN our ble&s;&s;ed Lord a&s;cended up on high, he gave Gifts to Men; and this was one of the precious Gifts of our a&s;cended Redeemer, even a &s;ettled Mini&s;try, an Order of Men &s;eperated and ordained to the Office and Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, to teach and in&s;truct Men in the Way of Salvation: And God having in his wi&s;e Providence inclined the Hearts of this People, to call you to this great and good Work among them; and your's al&s;o to accept their Invitation: We the Elders and Me&s;&s;engers now pre&s;ent, being &s;atisfied of your Gifts and Qualifications therefor, do now heartily join together to &s;eperate and ordain you to the Go&s;|pel Mini&s;try, according to Chri&s;t's Appointment, and particularly a Pa&s;tor over this Church, who&s;e Call you have now accepted: And we give thee Charge in the Sight of God, and before our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall judge the Quick and the Dead, at his Appearing and Kingdom, to take the Over&s;ight thereof, not for filthy Lucre &s;ake; but of a ready Mind. And we tru&s;t the great Lord of the Harve&s;t will be with you; who calls you to La|bour in his Vineyard, and make you an able, faith|ful, and &s;ucce&s;sful Mini&s;ter of the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>And we &s;olemnly Charge you before God, to preach the Word; be in&s;tant in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on: Reprove, Rebuke, Exhort, with all Long-&s;uffering and Doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004883_0028_100E08E2159AE628">Take Care to &s;hew thy &s;elf approved, a Work|man that needeth not to be a&s;hamed, rightly divid|ing the Word of Truth; and give to every one his Portion in due Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>Give Attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine; holding fa&s;t the faithful Word as thou ha&s;t been taught, according the Scriptures of Truth; that thou may&s;t be able both to exhort and convince Gain&s;ayers.</P>
<P>Take care al&s;o to in&s;truct the ignorant, convince the erroneous; contend earne&s;tly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints: You mu&s;t rebuke the ob|&s;tinate, and comfort the feeble minded.</P>
<P>Make full Proof of thy Mini&s;try: Meditate upon the&s;e Things; give thy &s;elf wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all Men.</P>
<P>Take heed to thy Self, and thy Doctrine; that thou maye&s;t both &s;ave thy &s;elf, and them that hear thee.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t pray for this People both in publick and private; and be their daily Interce&s;&s;or at the Throne of Grace.</P>
<P>Do thou al&s;o now receive Authority to admini&s;ter the Sacraments, and Seals of the New Te&s;tament, to Per&s;ons &s;uitably qualified: taking Care always to di&s;tingui&s;h between the precious and the vile; re|membring that Holine&s;s becomes God's Hou&s;e for ever.</P>
<P>Unto thee are now committed the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Key of Doctrine, and the Key of Di&s;cipline; them that Sin rebuke before all.</P>
<P>And we now &s;olemnly Charge thee before the great GOD, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and the elect
<PB N="27" REF="004883_0029_100E08E449735790">
Angels, that thou ob&s;erve the&s;e Things without preferring one before another; doing nothing by Partiality: keep thy &s;elf pure.</P>
<P>Let no Man de&s;pi&s;e thee; but be thou an Exam|ple to the Believers, in Word, in Conver&s;ation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider al&s;o that a Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s, and the Servant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be gen|tle towards all Men.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t be patient, in Meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them&s;elves, if peradventure God may give them Repentance to the acknowledgement of the Truth.</P>
<P>Carefully thus feed the Flock of CHRIST now committed to your Charge; not as being a Lord over God's Heritage, but as being an Example to the Flock: And when our ble&s;&s;ed LORD the great Shepherd &s;hall appear, you &s;hall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</P>
