<HEAD>CHAPTER I. General de&s;cription of the country of Algiers. Climate. Sea|coa&s;t. Principal cities.</HEAD>
<P>ALGIERS is a country which derives its name from its metropolis; and extends four hundred and eighty miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t along the northern coa&s;t of Africa. Its utmo&s;t breadth is three hundred and twenty miles, but at the di&s;tance of an hundred miles from the the &s;ea-coa&s;t, that part of Africa becomes a barren de&s;ert, almo&s;t utterly unin|habitable either by man or bea&s;t. Algiers is &s;ituated between thirty-two and thirty-&s;even degrees of north latitude, which corre&s;ponds to that of the United States, from Virginia to Carolina, inclu&s;ive. It is bounded on the north, by the Me|diterranean &s;ea; on the &s;outh, by mount Atlas; on the ea&s;t, by the country of Tunis; and on the we&s;t, by the river Mul|via, which &s;eparates it from the empire of Morocco.</P>
<P>The principal rivers, which water the territory of Algiers, ri&s;e in Mount Atlas, and run by a northerly direction into the Mediterranean &s;ea. They are &s;even in number. None of them has a long cour&s;e, or even is navigable; at lea&s;t none of them is made u&s;e of in navigation. It is however likely that they might be made u&s;e of for this purpo&s;e, were the inhabi|tants of a more intelligent and indu&s;trious character; for &s;ome of them are of a tolerable depth. Such is the gro&s;s ignorance of the natives in whatever concerns dome&s;tic improvement, that there is not a &s;ingle bridge over any of the&s;e rivers. When they are to be cro&s;&s;ed, the traveller hath &s;ometimes to wander for &s;everal miles in &s;earch of a ford, as ferry boats are unknown. If a heavy rain happens to fall, he is forced to wait, till the river returns to its u&s;ual &s;ize.</P>
<P>This country con&s;i&s;ts of eighteen provinces. The climate is remarkably delightful. The air is pure and &s;erene. The &s;oil is covered with almo&s;t a perpetual verdure. Extreme heat is not common. This de&s;cription applies to the lands on the
<PB N="4" REF="026733_0005_0FD1ACDFABEDED08">
&s;ea-coa&s;t; for as we advance into the country, the &s;oil becomes more parched and barren. Indeed a con&s;iderable part of the back country is a &s;avage de&s;ert, abounding with lions, tigers, leopards, buffaloes, wild boars, and porcupines. And it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the&s;e animals are not the lea&s;t amiable inhabitants of this country.</P>
<P>There are few towns of any con&s;equence, though when &s;ucce&s;&s;ively under the dominion of Carthage and Rome, it abounded with populous cities. Bona is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame place with the ancient Hippo, a &s;ea-port built by the an|cients. It was formerly the capital of the province of Bona. It lies on the Mediterranean &s;ea, and there is a coral fi&s;hery near it. It is a town of no importance, and of &s;lender popu|lation. In this part of the world, elegant architecture has, for many centuries, been utterly forgotten or de&s;pi&s;ed. The buildings of Bona, as every where el&s;e, are therefore mean. It is expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of the Arabs. The name of this people is u&s;ed by travellers in a very indefinite manner. Algiers is at the di&s;tance of &s;ome hundreds of leagues from Arabia: but as this part of Africa was formerly conquered by that nation, under the banners of Mahomet, the name is &s;till applied to a race of tawny and independent barbarians, who wander in gangs about the country, and unite the double profe&s;&s;ions of a &s;hepherd and a robber. Bona was formerly a magnificent city. Its grandeur is now only to be traced in the ruins of a mona|&s;tery. It has a fortre&s;s, and a garri&s;on of three hundred Turks, as the banditti chu&s;e to call them&s;elves; a Turk being the mo&s;t reputable title in that country. This circum&s;tance is alone &s;ufficient to a&s;certain the depth of its wretchedne&s;s. The&s;e ad|venturers however are not Turks, but the &s;weepings of all nations blended together. They are commanded by an aga, who is likewi&s;e governor of the town. Bona was taken by Charles V. in his expedition to Tunis, but was not long after recovered by its former ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantina is &s;ituated on the river Sef Gomar, forty-eight miles from the &s;ea-coa&s;t. It received its pre&s;ent name from that of a prince&s;s, the daughter of the emperor Con&s;tantine, to whom it was indebted for magnificence. The &s;ituation is on a penin&s;ula, difficult of acce&s;s, except towards the &s;outh-we&s;t. It is one mile in circumference, well fortified, and contains many fragments of ancient architecture. In particular there is part of a noble bridge; and near it is a large &s;ubterraneous aqueduct, which terminates in a ca&s;cade. State criminals are &s;ometimes precipitated down this place, and da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the rocks at its bottom. A bey re&s;ides here, and has under his command three hundred Turki&s;h hor&s;e, and one
<PB N="5" REF="026733_0006_0FD1ACE5AB163660">
thou&s;and five hundred Moori&s;h &s;oldiers. This is the account giv|en by travellers, though it is not likely that the number of the garri&s;on is always the &s;ame. In details of this kind, we mu&s;t be contented with the be&s;t materials that can be had, though &s;ometimes not entirely above exception. The inhabitants of Con&s;tantina are &s;aid to be opulent and haughty. This city was formerly the re&s;idence of a race of kings who governed the province of Con&s;tantina, of which it is the metropolis; but in the year 1520, the whole territory was conquered by Barbaro&s;&s;a, that di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;courge of mankind, who annexed it to the government of Algiers. Some &s;plendid ruins exi&s;t in the vici|nity of Con&s;tantina. Upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from it, are the traces of a Roman colony, anciently called Colo. It is &s;ituated on a high rock, and has a garri&s;on. Ad|joining to it is a French factory, to which the Moors bring hides, wax, and wool, for &s;ale. At no great di&s;tance are the remains of the ancient city of Stora. It is &s;aid that the moun|tainous part of this territory is inhabited by a hardy people, who can rai&s;e forty thou&s;and fighting men. It is not probable, that tho&s;e writers who made this affection had ever an oppor|tunity of counting their number. Hi&s;tory abounds with &s;uch random calculations. The vagabond who founded Rome has been &s;upplied by the genero&s;ity of &s;ucceeding hi&s;torians, with an army about equally numerous, though it is, at the &s;ame time, acknowledged, that his <HI>kingdom</HI> was only &s;even or eight miles in length.</P>
<P>Gigeri is &s;ituated about fifteen miles from Bona. It contains about fifteen hundred hou&s;es, and the inhabitants are very poor. It is defended by a fort and a &s;mall garri&s;on. The natives of this part of the country are independent and barbarous. They retire, when circum&s;tances require it, to inacce&s;&s;ible fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, and &s;et the dey of Algiers at defiance. Ships, when wrecked on this coa&s;t, are plundered, and the crews are treated with the utmo&s;t &s;avagene&s;s. In this re&s;pect, however, the natives of the territory of Gigeri cannot differ much for the wor&s;e from the re&s;t of their countrymen; nor is the practice peculiar to Barbary. Scenes of the &s;ame kind are frequently acted, and if any thing can be &s;till more infamous, are almo&s;t always acted with impunity, on the coa&s;t of Cornwall, and other maritime counties of England.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a &s;tory of an Engli&s;h par&s;on, who&s;e congregation, dur|ing the time of divine &s;ervice, heard of a &s;hipwreck. In &s;pite of his utmo&s;t efforts to detain them, the whole a&s;&s;embly ru&s;hed out of church, in a body, to divide the plunder.</NOTE> The French, in the year 1666, had begun to fortify Gigeri. They were driven from it by the
<PB N="6" REF="026733_0007_0FD1ACE5B028CFC8">
Algerines, with the lo&s;s of their cannon, and mo&s;t of their effects.</P>
<P>Bugia was formerly the capital of a kingdom of the &s;ame name. It &s;tands at the mouth of the river Major, or Zinganor, about twenty leagues to the ea&s;tward of Algiers. It is little better than a heap of ruins; a de&s;cription which applies to al|mo&s;t every town in that part of the world. It has three ca&s;tles, two at the port, and one upon a rock, at a &s;mall di&s;tance be|hind them. In the year 1671, a Briti&s;h admiral took or de|&s;troyed, in this harbour, nine Algerine &s;hips of war. It is ex|tremely &s;eldom, that an admiral has been charged with &s;uch a laudable commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ste&s;&s;a or Steffa is &s;ituated in a fertile valley, &s;ixty miles to the &s;outh of Bugia, and fifteen miles from the &s;ea. It exhibits only the melancholy ruins of its former magnificence, contain|ing about three hundred mi&s;erable families.</P>
<P>Tebef was formerly a flouri&s;hing city, but is at pre&s;ent extremely reduced. Zamoura is in the &s;ame condition. It is defended by a fort. Couco was once the metropolis of a king|dom of the &s;ame name. Its &s;overeigns were in the habit of forming alliances with the court of Spain. For this rea&s;on, the Algerines, in the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, ravag|ed the whole country, and de&s;troyed every town in it. The inhabitants have &s;till &s;upported their independence, by taking refuge in the mountainous parts of the country, which are &s;aid to be very fertile; but the Algerines prevent them from holding any intercour&s;e with foreign nations. Bi&s;cara has a fort and garri&s;on. One of the chief employments of the people here, is to catch and tame lions, tigers, and other bea&s;ts of prey, which they carry for &s;ale to Algiers. Necanz is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t towns in Barbary. It is watered by an agree|able river, who&s;e banks are adorned with a variety of beautiful trees. The town contains a magnificent mo&s;que and a college for the education of Mahometan &s;tudents.</P>
<P>Oran is &s;ituated about two hundred and fifty miles we&s;t of Algiers. It lies partly on a plain, and partly on the a&s;cent of a hill. It is a mile and an half in circumference and tolerably fortified. But it is unfortunately commanded by &s;ome of the neighbouring eminences; &s;o that a garri&s;on of ten or twelve thou&s;and men is nece&s;&s;ary to defend it with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t a &s;kilful enemy. As the Spani&s;h coa&s;ts and merchant &s;hips had &s;uffered much from the cor&s;airs of this port, Ferdinand, king of Spain, determined to attempt its reduction. For this purpo&s;e, he tran&s;ported into Africa an army, under the command of his prime mini&s;ter cardinal Ximenes, one of tho&s;e &s;ew &s;tate&s;|men, who have not de&s;erved the dete&s;tation of mankind.
<PB N="7" REF="026733_0008_0FD1ACEA48D16E58">
The wonted good fortune of Ximenes did not, at this junc|ture, de&s;ert him. He had maintained a corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of the people of Oran; and when the Moors &s;allied out to attack the Spani&s;h army, their perfidious countrymen &s;hut the gates again&s;t them. Ximenes killed four thou&s;and of the barbarians, and &s;et at liberty twenty thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;laves. The Algerines, during almo&s;t two hundred years, made frequent and un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to recover the town. At la&s;t, in 1708, they retook it. In June, 1732, a Spani&s;h army was di&s;embarked not far from Oran. The Turki&s;h com|mander, his troops, and the inhabitants were &s;eized with a panic, and abandoned their fortifications without much re|&s;i&s;tance. The victors found in the place an hundred and forty-&s;ix pieces of cannon, be&s;ides mortars, and at lea&s;t fifty &s;hip loads of provi&s;ions. This latter &s;upply contributed much to the pre&s;ervation of their new conque&s;t. Without it they mu&s;t have run the greate&s;t hazard of peri&s;hing in the mid&s;t of &s;ucce&s;s; as a tempe&s;t, which la&s;ted for &s;everal days, cut off all intercour&s;e between the army upon &s;hore, and the fleet at &s;ea. The Moors not long after attacked the Spaniards with great fury, but were finally repul&s;ed with much &s;laughter on both &s;ides. Oran is &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Spain.</P>
<P>Treme&s;en was formerly the capital town of a kingdom of that name. It is &s;ituated ninety miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Oran, &s;urrounded by a &s;trong wall and well fortified. It has five gates with draw-bridges before them, and a ca&s;tle containing hand&s;ome barracks for the Jani&s;aries who are in garri&s;on. Treme&s;en while a metropolis was a &s;plendid city. It contained one hundred and fifty mo&s;ques, and one hundred and &s;ixty public baths. Since it cea&s;ed to be the &s;eat of an independent government, it hath &s;hrunk into ruins and de&s;olation. The mo&s;ques are reduced to eight, and its public baths to four. The inhabitants are extremely indigent.</P>
<P>Mo&s;tagan &s;tands fifty miles ea&s;t of Oran. This town is built in the form of a theatre opening to the &s;ea, and &s;urrounded on every other &s;ide with rocks that hang over it. The ruins of an old Moori&s;h ca&s;tle &s;tand in a &s;pace between the rocks, and there is a &s;trong &s;tone wall towards the port, with a modern built ca&s;tle, garri&s;oned by a number of Turks. The citadel is erected upon the &s;ummit of one of the rocks, and commands both city and territory. The haven is commodious, and the town is well &s;upplied with water. The neighbouring moun|tains are inhabited by a people called Magarabas, who live in tents, po&s;&s;e&s;s a great number of flocks, and pay to the dey of Algiers twelve thou&s;and crowns annually. There is a hand|&s;ome mo&s;que in this town.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="026733_0009_0FD1ACEC68D8F090">
Tenez is &s;ituated about one hundred miles to the ea&s;tward of Oran, twenty miles ea&s;t of Mo&s;tagan, and at a league di&s;tant from the &s;ea, where it has a convenient port. There is a ca&s;tle that was once a royal palace, and in which the governor re&s;ides. The fortifications are &s;trong, the garri&s;on numerous, and the neighbouring territory fertile. This was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the Julia Cae&s;area of the ancients.</P>
<P>Sercelli lies between Tenez and Algiers, about twenty-four miles to the we&s;tward of the latter. It is defended by a Turki&s;h garri&s;on, and has a port, which will only admit of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. This was anciently a large and populous city, but is at pre&s;ent a poor and de&s;olate place.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern part of the Algerine territories is inhabited by a wandering race of people, who, like the Tartars, roam from place to place, and live in tents. The country it&s;elf is hilly, a branch of mount Atlas running through it. The only riches of the people are their numerous flocks and herds. The government exacts a tribute from them, but a bey is obliged to come annually at the head of an army to collect it; and many of them retire to inacce&s;&s;ible places till the troops are withdrawn, in order to evade the payment.</P>
<P>Algiers it&s;elf &s;tands on a bay of the Mediterranean &s;ea. It is built on the &s;ide of a mountain. The hou&s;es ri&s;e gra|dually from the &s;ea-&s;hore up the a&s;cent, in the form of an amphitheatre. The town appears beautiful at a di&s;tance, when approaching from the water. The mo&s;ques, ca&s;tles, and other public buildings have a &s;triking effect; but the &s;treets are narrow, and the hou&s;es mean. The roofs are flat, &s;o that the people can vi&s;it each other, at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance in the town without going into the &s;treets. The walls are about a league in circumference, and defended by &s;ome &s;quare towers and ba&s;tions. The port has a pier about five hundred paces in length, which extends from the continent to a &s;mall rocky i&s;land called the Lantern. On this i&s;land, there is a ca&s;tle with three lines of bra&s;s cannon. The town has five gates, ten great mo&s;ques, and fifty le&s;&s;er ones, and is computed to contain an hundred thou&s;and inhabitants. The fortifications are exten&s;ive and &s;trong. The Chri&s;tian &s;laves are often employed in removing &s;tones from a quarry, at &s;ome di&s;tance in the country, which they lay on the &s;and, to defend the mole from the impetuo&s;ity of the waves. This laborious work is never at an end, becau&s;e the &s;ea con&s;tantly wa&s;hes away the &s;tones, and makes a perpetual &s;upply nece&s;|&s;ary. One &s;treet, which is broad and hand&s;ome, pa&s;&s;es through the town from ea&s;t to we&s;t; but all the other &s;treets are narrow, incommodious, and dirty. There are &s;aid to be
<PB N="9" REF="026733_0010_0FD1ACEEC0433ED8">
fifteen thou&s;and hou&s;es, which are commonly built round a &s;mall &s;quare with a paved court in the centre. Around this court is a double range of galleries, one above the other, and both &s;upported by columns. The palace of the dey &s;tands in the centre of the city. This building is very exten&s;ive, and &s;urrounded by two &s;uperb galleries, &s;upported by marble pillars. There is a law here, by which any woman con|victed of amorous corre&s;pondence with a Chri&s;tian, is thrown into the &s;ea, with her head tied up in a &s;ack, unle&s;s her lover chu&s;es to turn Mahometan. Examples of this kind are not unfrequent, as the fair &s;ex, in that part of the world, are &s;aid to be remarkably frail. Six of the baths have been converted into pri&s;ons for the Chri&s;tian &s;laves. In each of the&s;e, there is a chapel for the free exerci&s;e of their religion. Every &s;lave is let out at a certain hour in the morning, and mu&s;t return at a &s;tated hour at night, in order to be locked up. Each of them is allowed a matra&s;s and a rug for a bed. There are &s;everal tolerable edifices without the walls of the town, which add to the beauty of the environs. Among the&s;e are a variety of Turki&s;h &s;epulchres and monuments. One of the&s;e monu|ments contains &s;ix magnificent tombs of a circular figure. They were erected to the memory of &s;ix deys, who were, in the cour&s;e of a few days, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively elected and murdered. There is perhaps no nation in the world from which we may not learn &s;ome u&s;eful le&s;&s;on. With re&s;pect to the burial of their dead, travellers inform us, that the Mahometans di&s;co|ver a degree of delicacy, of which Chri&s;tians have no concep|tion. In our church yards, nothing is more common, and &s;urely nothing can be more completely &s;hocking, than to &s;ee graves broke up, a &s;econd time, before the per&s;on has returned to his original du&s;t; and the remains of the dead are to&s;&s;ed about with as little ceremony as po&s;&s;ible. This wretched violation of decency ari&s;es from the orthodox de&s;ire of being buried in holy ground; a practice which has no doubt been encouraged by the parties concerned, for the purpo&s;e of exacting a high price. Exorbitant demands of this kind have not long &s;ince been paid within le&s;s than an hundred miles of Philadelphia. The Algerines, and the other profe&s;&s;ors of the Mahometan religion, would regard it as an act of the mo&s;t barbarous &s;acrilege to di&s;turb the remains of the dead, by open|ing their graves, at any di&s;tance of time, or upon any pre|tence whatever.

<P>Algiers had formerly nothing but rain water. A Moor, who had been driven from Spain, con&s;tructed two aqueducts, by which it is now &s;upplied with abundance of excellent water

from the adjacent mountains. The country around this city is very fertile. Country-&s;eats, gardens, and groves of trees are &s;aid to be numerous. The Algerines are unacquainted with the art of pruning and grafting trees. Their gardens are not walled, but fenced round with a peculiar &s;pecies of fig-trees, which from their prickles, and the compactne&s;s with which their branches interweave, are well adapted for that purpo&s;e. Among other rich tracts in the province of Algiers Proper, the great plain of Mettijah is admired for its a&s;toni&s;hing fertility. It is fifty miles in length, twenty in breadth, and includes many villas, fragrant groves, and delightful gardens. The &s;oil produces &s;uch a profu&s;ion of the mo&s;t delicious fruits, rice, roots, and grain of every &s;pecies, that the inhabitants enjoy annually two, and frequently three crops. The hot baths of M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">cga, in the neighbourhood of this city, are natural curi|o&s;ities. The principal one is twelve feet &s;quare and four deep. The water is very hot, and when it has filled the larger ba&s;on, runs through into another of a &s;maller &s;ize, where the Jews bathe, as they are not permitted to u&s;e the &s;ame bath, with the Mahometans. The&s;e hot fountains are conjectured to proceed from the great quantities of &s;ulphur, nitre, and other inflam|mable &s;ub&s;tances in the bowels of the earth. To this cau&s;e likewi&s;e have been a&s;cribed tho&s;e earthquakes, to which the whole country, and Algiers in particular, are frequently &s;ubjected.</P>

<P>THE pre&s;ent inhabitants of the territory of Algiers are compo&s;ed of a multitude of different nations. Among tho&s;e are the Moors or More&s;cos who were driven out of Spain about the end of the &s;ixteenth century, and the Arabians who trace their de&s;cent from tho&s;e di&s;ciples of Mahomet who former|ly &s;ubdued this country. Levantines, Turks, Jews, and Chri&s;tian &s;laves, with a croud formed of the po&s;terity of all the&s;e different people, make up the re&s;t of the population. The Moors and Arabs are the mo&s;t numerous. The former compo&s;e the great body of the inhabitants of the towns. But it may be readily &s;uppo&s;ed, that amid&s;t &s;uch a variety of differ|ent races, immen&s;e numbers cannot be &s;aid to belong to any particular tribe or nation whatever. In this country there are many wondering bands of &s;hepherds who live together in camps, and remove from one place to another as they want pa&s;ture for their herds and flocks, or as any other accidental circum&s;tance hap|pens
<PB N="11" REF="026733_0012_0FD1ACF494025468">
to make it nece&s;&s;ary. They &s;ometimes pay rent to land|lords, in corn, fruit, honey, wax, and other productions of the &s;ame kind. The dey likewi&s;e demands a tribute. The ex|cellence of the climate renders this &s;imple way of living tolera|ble, though the tents of the&s;e people are mean, their uten&s;ils of little value, and their lodging filthy. The family and their dome&s;tic animals lie promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the tents together, ex|cept the dogs, which are left on the out&s;ide as guards. They rai&s;e con&s;iderable numbers of bees and of &s;ilk-worms. They &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on bread, rice and fruit. Wine and &s;pirituous liquors are almo&s;t entirely unknown.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the men is only a long piece of coar&s;e cloth wrapped round the &s;houlders, and falling down to their ankles, with a cap of the &s;ame &s;tuff. The women pay &s;ome more at|tention to the ornamental part of dre&s;s. The children are &s;uf|fered to go &s;tark naked till &s;even or eight years of age. The Sheik or chief of a tribe wears a cap of fine cloth. The&s;e peo|ple are u&s;ually called Arabs; their cu&s;toms, language and religion bear a &s;trict affinity with tho&s;e of Arabia. They are robu&s;t and of a &s;warthy complexion. The men are active, the women prolific, and the children healthy. They have neither to encounter the hard&s;hips incident to the life of a North-American &s;avage, nor are their con&s;titutions enfeebled, as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e in manufacturing towns, by &s;edentary and unhealthy employments. When a young man would marry, he drives a number of cattle to the hut where the pa|rents of his mi&s;tre&s;s re&s;ide. The bride is &s;et on hor&s;eback and led home, amid&s;t the &s;houts of a croud of young people, who have been invited to the nuptial fea&s;t. When &s;he arrives at the hut of her lover, a mixture of milk and honey is given her to drink, and a &s;ong &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion is &s;ung. She then alights, and is pre&s;ented with a &s;tick, which &s;he thru&s;ts into the ground, and repeats &s;ome lines to the following effect: <Q>As this &s;tick is fa&s;tened in the earth, &s;o I am in duty bound to my hu&s;band; as nothing but violence can remove it, &s;o death alone &s;hall force me from his love.</Q> She then drives his flock to water and back again, to &s;hew her willing|ne&s;s to perform any duty that he may a&s;&s;ign her. The&s;e pre|vious ceremonies being &s;ettled, all the company enter the hut, and the evening concludes with the greate&s;t fe&s;tivity that the&s;e people are capable of enjoying. Sub&s;equent to the marriage, the wife is obliged to wear a vail. She never &s;tirs from the hut for the &s;pace of a month, after that time. The&s;e are the ceremonies reported to be cu&s;tomary in celebrating a marriage among the pa&s;toral tribes of Barbary. But narratives of this kind mu&s;t be received, as bi&s;hop Burnet admoni&s;hes the reader,

to peru&s;e his Hi&s;tory of his own times, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>with &s;ome grains of allowance.</HI> Such uniform regularity is hardly to be expect|ed among a race of wandering &s;hepherds. Perhaps an African critic would turn from our de&s;cription of his country with as much di&s;dain, as a citizen of the United States feels in at|tempting to peru&s;e a frothy volume re&s;pecting North-America, fabricated by &s;ome of the profe&s;&s;ional book-builders of Paris or of London.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following curious circum&s;tances may &s;erve to &s;hew what kind of opinion ought to be entertained of the authors of oriental tra|vels. In the year 1783, an adventurer, who called him&s;elf a mo|dern Greek, publi&s;hed a &s;mall volume entitled <HI>the life of Ali Bey.</HI> It contained &s;ome romantic &s;tories, which the author atte&s;ted as an eye|witne&s;s. About this time the court of France had di&s;patched into Egypt Mon&s;ieur Savary, a gentleman of &s;ome note in the republic of letters. His bu&s;ine&s;s was to obtain authentic information concern|ing the ancient and modern &s;ituation of that country. He returned, and in due time publi&s;hed two large volumes, pregnant with learning and &s;ublimity. Mon&s;ieur Volney &s;oon after entered the li&s;ts as a third champion. He made a very &s;evere attack on the veracity of his French predece&s;&s;or. In particular, he upbraided him with having &s;tolen a great number of pages, from a very contemptible impo&s;ture which pretended to be a <HI>life of Ali Bey.</HI> This biographer, as an evidence, perhaps, of his cla&s;&s;ical pedigree, had a&s;&s;umed the name of <HI>Co&s;mopolitos.</HI> Volney added that a copy of the book having by chance come to Egypt, while he was there, the European merchants in that province could not help expre&s;&s;ing their &s;urprize, that their country|men were &s;tupid enough to dige&s;t &s;uch ridiculous reveries. Mon&s;ieur Savary did not long &s;urvive this humiliating di&s;covery. But the "Modern Greek" replied in a volume of letters, which he in&s;cribed by permi&s;&s;ion to Sir William Fordyce, an eminent Engli&s;h phy&s;ician. In this work he affirms that Volney him&s;elf wrote HIS travels <HI>in a gar|ret at London.</HI> BELLA! HORRIDA BELLA!</P>
<P>It is certainly, though not generally known, that the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague are the off&s;pring of a mercantile pen. Even Baron Tott, and Mr. Bruce, though writers of <HI>comparative</HI> authenticity, require in the reader, &s;trong and frequent do&s;es of faith.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The Moors or Arabs, for the two names appear to be &s;ynonymous, are good hor&s;emen, but great thieves. Their principal arms are a &s;hort lance and a &s;cymitar, though they are likewi&s;e acquainted with the bow and the mu&s;ket. It is dan|gerous to travel in the country, for fear of being robbed; but per&s;ons are &s;aid to be in &s;afety, if attended by one of the Ma|hometan Marabouts or hermits. The inhabitants of the &s;ea-coa&s;t are perfectly ver&s;ant in the u&s;e of fire-arms.</P>
<P>Algiers retains the title of a kingdom; an epithet which might, without regret, be expunged from every human voca|bulary.
<PB N="13" REF="026733_0014_0FD1AD04E365D808">
It is however a military republic, though it certainly can reflect no lu&s;tre on that &s;pecies of government. The na|tional ordinances run in the&s;e words: <Q>We, the great, and &s;mall members of the mighty and invincible militia of Al|giers,</Q> &amp;c. The dey is elected by a divan compo&s;ed from the army. He &s;eldom &s;ecures his office, without tumult and blood&s;hed; and he often falls by the dagger of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. This &s;overeign may with peculiar propriety adopt the expre&s;|&s;ion of one of the heroes of O&s;&s;ian: <Q>I was born in the mid&s;t of battles, and my &s;teps mu&s;t move in blood to the tomb.</Q> The way in which his authority is exerci&s;ed, corre&s;ponds with that by which it has been obtained. When Mr. Bruce, as Briti&s;h re&s;ident at Algiers, had occa&s;ion to vi&s;it the dey, he &s;ometimes found him in his hall of audience, with his clothes all be&s;pattered with blood, like tho&s;e of a carca&s;e butcher. It is a very frequent amu&s;ement with him, to cau&s;e the heads of his &s;ubjects to be &s;truck off in his pre&s;ence. Mr. Bruce &s;aid, that he knew of one man, who was executed, for no greater offence than becau&s;e a gun-flint was found upon him. His indictment and trial were very conci&s;e. <Q>You ra&s;cal, what bu&s;ine&s;s have you with a flint, unle&s;s you were going to con&s;pire again&s;t the &s;tate?</Q></P>
<P>The aga of the Jani&s;aries is the officer next to the dey in dignity and power. He enjoys his po&s;t but two months, and then retires upon a pen&s;ion. The other officers of importance are a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, twenty-four Chiah ba&s;&s;as or colonels &s;ubordinate to the aga, eight hundred &s;enior captains, and four hundred lieutenants. Among the&s;e officers, the right of &s;eniority is &s;trictly ob&s;erved. A breach of this point would be expected to produce a revolt among the &s;oldiers, and might per|haps co&s;t the dey his life. Be&s;ides the&s;e officers, there are others belonging to the Turki&s;h forces, who form a &s;eparate body. The dey has a corps of guards; a very nece&s;&s;ary, though &s;ometimes a fruitle&s;s precaution; as any private &s;oldier who has the courage to murder him, &s;tands an equal chance of becoming his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Experiments of this de&s;cription are &s;ometimes made. Since the beginning of the pre&s;ent cen|tury, &s;ix private &s;oldiers entered into a con&s;piracy to kill a dey of one of the &s;tates of Barbary. They gave him a mortal wound in his palace, and in the mid&s;t of a croud of people. He expired, exclaiming, "Has nobody the courage to kill a villain?" One of the con&s;pirators, the intended &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in&s;tantly a&s;cended the vacant throne, and brandi&s;hing his naked &s;cymitar, declared <HI>that he would do ju&s;tice to ali!</HI> His five a&s;&s;ociates went about the hall to inforce the title of their new ma&s;ter; and none pre&s;ent &s;eemed to give them&s;elves any

di&s;turbance about what had happened. He kept his &s;ituation unmole&s;ted, for about ten minutes, till an old veteran unob|&s;erved took aim with a mu&s;ket or blunderbu&s;s, and &s;hot him dead. Upon this, the five others were immediately di&s;patched by the per&s;ons pre&s;ent. But what &s;hewed the nature of the government in its proper light was the ob&s;ervation of the new dey. He &s;aid, that if the u&s;urper could have held his place for twenty minutes longer, he would have obtained the throne.</P>
<P>The people of Algiers in general &s;peak a compound of Ara|bic, More&s;co, and the remains of the ancient Phoenician lan|guages. The natives of all denominations, for the mo&s;t part, under&s;tand the <HI>Lingua Franca.</HI> This is a kind of dialect, which, without being the proper language of any country on the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean &s;ea, has a kind of univer&s;al currency all over that quarter of the world, as the channel of information for people, who cannot under&s;tand each other through any medium but it&s;elf. The public bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation is tran&s;acted in the Turki&s;h tongue, in which al&s;o the records are kept. It is curious, that in conver&s;ation, a Turk tran&s;po&s;es his nouns and verbs, in the &s;ame way that the Greek and Latin writers have done. Some of our modern critics have been woefully perplexed in attempting to explain this practice, which they &s;eem to con&s;ider as peculiar to tho&s;e two ancient languages. Had they been acquainted with the circum&s;tance ju&s;t now mentioned, they might readily have &s;olved &s;ome of their doubts by a voyage to Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>In Algiers, both men and women &s;pend a great part of their time in indolence; the men, in drinking coffee and &s;moak|ing; and the women, in dre&s;&s;ing, bathing, vi&s;iting the tombs of their relations, and &s;auntering in their gardens. The Algerines by their law may have four wives, but they u&s;ually content them&s;elves with two or three at the mo&s;t. The hu&s;band &s;eldom &s;ees his wife before marriage, but accepts her upon de&s;cription of a female confident. When the match is agreed upon, the bridegroom &s;ends a pre&s;ent of fruits and &s;weetmeats to the bride, and entertains her relations with a fea&s;t and a mu&s;ical entertainment.</P>
<P>The militia who elect the dey are either Turks or renegado Chri&s;tians. Their number has been variou&s;ly &s;tated by differ|ent authors from &s;ix thou&s;and five hundred to twelve thou&s;and. The dey pays no other revenue to the grand &s;eignior, than that of a certain number of hand&s;ome youths, and &s;ome other annual pre&s;ents. His income is more or le&s;s in proportion to his opportunities of plundering his neighbours or his &s;ubjects. Dr. Shaw &s;ays, that the taxes of the whole kingdom produce
<PB N="15" REF="026733_0016_0FD1AD0954056590">
yearly to the dey but about three hundred thou&s;and dollars. He conjectures that the eighth &s;hare of the prizes, the property of per&s;ons who die without children, and to whom the dey falls heir, with the pre&s;ents from foreign nations, and his private acts of robbery at home, extend to an equal &s;um. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that this calculation mu&s;t be extremely que&s;|tionable. The tyrant him&s;elf can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed capable to give a di&s;tinct e&s;timate.</P>
<P>The Mufti, the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">i, and the grand Marabout, are the principal eccle&s;ia&s;tics. The fir&s;t is the high prie&s;t of their religion; the &s;econd, the &s;upreme judge in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, and in &s;uch civil matters as the civil power does not interpo&s;e in. The third is the chief of an order of &s;aints or hermits. The&s;e three per&s;ons are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the largene&s;s of their turbans. They &s;it in the divan a little below the dey, on his right hand. The divan it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ts of about two thou&s;and Turki&s;h officers and &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The common puni&s;hment at Algiers, for offences not capital, is the ba&s;tinado; for tho&s;e, which are &s;o, the bow-&s;tring, which two people pull different ways with all their &s;trength, &s;o that the criminal is in&s;tantly di&s;patched. The Chri&s;tian &s;laves are liable to a variety of puni&s;hments. They are &s;ome|times burned, or rather roa&s;ted alive. At other times, they are impaled. This is done, by placing the offender on the end of a &s;harp &s;take, which is thru&s;t up his po&s;teriors clo&s;e by the back-bone, till it appears above his &s;houlders. Slaves are &s;ometimes ca&s;t over the walls of a town upon iron hooks. The&s;e catch by the jaws, by the ribs, or &s;ome other part of the body; and the &s;ufferers have been known to hang thus for &s;everal days, alive, and in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torture. Cru|cifixion, by nailing the hands and feet to walls, is likewi&s;e practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>A Moor convicted of hou&s;e-breaking, hath his right hand cut off and fa&s;tened about his neck. He is then led through the city on an a&s;s, with his face towards its tail. Per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, for crimes again&s;t the &s;tate, are placed between two boards, and &s;awed a&s;under. Women, detected in adul|tery, are fixed by their necks to a pole, and held under water till they are &s;uffocated.</P>
<P>When an Algerine pirate takes a prize, he examines into the quality and circum&s;tances of the pri&s;oners If he di&s;be|lieves the account that they give of them&s;elves, they are ba&s;|tinadoed, till he has met with an agreeable an&s;wer. Having obtained what information he is able, he brings them on &s;hore, after having &s;tripped them almo&s;t naked. He carries them directly to the palace of the dey, where the European
<PB N="16" REF="026733_0017_0FD1AD0A6009CC28">
con&s;uls a&s;&s;emble, to &s;ee if any of the pri&s;oners belong to their re&s;pective nations, who are at peace with Algiers. In that ca&s;e, they reclaim them, provided that they were only pa&s;|&s;engers; but if they have &s;erved on board of the &s;hips of any people at war with "the mighty and invincible militia," they cannot be di&s;charged without payment of the full ran&s;om.</P>
<P>Matters are thus &s;ettled between the dey and the con&s;uls, what part of the pri&s;oners are to be &s;et at liberty, and what part are to be con&s;idered as &s;laves. The dey has next his choice of every eighth &s;lave. He generally chu&s;es the ma&s;ters, &s;urgeons, carpenters, and mo&s;t u&s;eful hands belonging to the &s;everal prizes. Be&s;ides his eighth, he lays claim to all pri|&s;oners of quality, for whom a &s;uperior ran&s;om is to be expected. The re&s;t are left to the cor&s;air and his owners. They are car|ried to the &s;lave market; the crier proclaims their rank, pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and circum&s;tances, and the price &s;et upon each of them. They are then led to the court before the palace of the dey, and there &s;old to the be&s;t bidder. If any &s;um is offered beyond the price fir&s;t &s;et upon them, it belongs to the govern|ment. The captors and owners have only that which was originally &s;et upon the &s;laves. For this practice of buying and &s;elling &s;laves, we are not entitled to charge the Algerines with any exclu&s;ive degree of barbarity. The Chri&s;tians of Europe and America carry on this commerce an hundred times more exten&s;ively than the Algerines. It has received a recent &s;anction from the immaculate <HI>Divan</HI> of Britain. Nobody &s;eems even to be &s;urpri&s;ed by a diabolical kind of adverti&s;e|ments, which, for &s;ome months pa&s;t, have frequently adorned the new&s;papers of Philadelphia. The French fugitives from the We&s;t-Indies have brought with them a croud of &s;laves. The&s;e mo&s;t injured people &s;ometimes run off, and their ma&s;ter adverti&s;es a reward for apprehending them. At the &s;ame time, we are commonly informed, that his &s;acred name is marked in capitals, on their brea&s;ts; or in plainer terms, it is &s;tamped on that part of the body with a red hot iron. Before therefore we reprobate the ferocity of the Algerines, we &s;hould enquire whether it is not po&s;&s;ible to find, in &s;ome other regions of the globe, a &s;y&s;tematic brutality &s;till more di&s;graceful?</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Origin of the pre&s;ent government of Algiers. Expedition of Charles V.</HEAD>
<P>ALGIERS had undergone a variety of revolutions in its form of government, previous to the beginning of the
<PB N="17" REF="026733_0018_0FD1AD0EA8FD4170">
&s;ixteenth century, which it is not within the plan of this &s;ketch to de&s;cribe. But about that time a &s;udden revolution happened, which, by rendering the &s;tates of Barbary formidable to the Europeans, hath made their hi&s;tory worthy of more attention. Horuc and Hayradin, the &s;ons of a potter in the i&s;le of Le&s;bos, prompted by a re&s;tle&s;s and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, for&s;ook their fa|ther's profe&s;&s;ion, ran to &s;ea, and joined a crew of pirates. They &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their valour and activi|ty, and becoming ma&s;ters of a &s;mall brigantine, &s;upported their infamous trade with &s;uch conduct and &s;ucce&s;s, that they a&s;&s;embled a fleet of twelve galleys, be&s;ides many ve&s;&s;els of &s;maller force. Of this fleet, Horuc, the elder brother, called Barbaro&s;&s;a from the red colour of his beard, was admiral, and Hayradin &s;econd in command. Their names &s;oon became terrible from the Straits of the Dardanelles to tho&s;e of Gibraltar. Together with their power their ambitious views extended, and while acting as cor&s;airs, they a&s;&s;umed the ideas, and acquired the talents of conquerors. They often carried the prizes, which they took on the coa&s;t of Spain and Italy, into the ports of Barbary. The convenient &s;ituation of the&s;e harbours, lying &s;o near the great|e&s;t commerical &s;tates at that time in Chri&s;tendom, made the brothers wi&s;h for an e&s;tabli&s;hment in that country. An opportu|nity of accompli&s;hing this project, pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and they did not &s;uffer it to pa&s;s unimproved. Eutemi, king of Algiers, having attempted &s;everal times, without &s;ucce&s;s, to take a fort which the Spani&s;h governors of Oran had built not far from his capital, applied to Barbaro&s;&s;a. The cor&s;air, leaving his bro|ther Hayradin with the fleet, marched at the head of five thou|&s;and men to Algiers. Such a force gave him the command of the town. He &s;ecretly murdered the monarch whom he had come to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and proclaimed him&s;elf king in his &s;tead. The authority which he had u&s;urped, he e&s;tabli&s;hed by arts &s;uited to the genius of the people whom he had to govern; by liberality without bounds to tho&s;e who favoured his promotion, and by cruelty no le&s;s unbounded to all whom he had any rea&s;on to mi&s;tru&s;t. He continued to infe&s;t the coa&s;t of Spain and Italy with fleets which re&s;embled the armaments of a great monarch, rather than the &s;quadrons of a pirate. Their frequent and cruel deva&s;tations obliged Charles V. about the beginning of his reign, to furni&s;h the Marquis de Comares, governor of Oran, with troops &s;ufficient to attack him. That officer executed the commi&s;&s;ion with &s;uch &s;pirit, that Barbaro&s;&s;a's forces being van|qui&s;hed in &s;everal encounters, he him&s;elf was &s;hut up in Tre|me&s;en, and in attempting to make his e&s;cape was fortunately &s;lain.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="026733_0019_0FD1AD0F9EA72330">
His brother Hayradin, known likewi&s;e by the name of Bar|baro&s;&s;a, a&s;&s;umed the &s;ceptre of Algiers. He carried on his na|val robberies with great vigour, and extended his conque&s;ts on the continent of Africa. But perceiving that the Moors and Arabs &s;ubmitted to his government with the utmo&s;t reluc|tance, and being afraid that his continual depredations would, one day, draw upon him the arms of the Chri&s;tians, he put his dominions under the protection of the grand &s;eignior, and re|ceived from him a body of Turki&s;h &s;oldiers &s;ufficient for his &s;e|curity again&s;t his dome&s;tic as well as foreign enemies. At la&s;t, the infamy, or, as Dr. Robert&s;on calls it, the <HI>fame</HI> of his ex|ploits daily increa&s;ing, Solyman offered him the command of the Turki&s;h fleet; and Hayradin on the other hand, ju&s;tly dreading the con&s;equences of the tyranny of his officers over the Algerines, &s;ought the protection of the grand &s;eignior. This was readily granted, and him&s;elf appointed ba&s;haw or viceroy of Algiers; by which means he received &s;uch con&s;iderable rein|forcements, that the unhappy Algerines dur&s;t not make the lea&s;t complaint; and &s;uch numbers of Turks re&s;orted to him, that he was not only capable of keeping the Moors and Arabs in &s;ubjection at home, but of annoying the Chri&s;tians at &s;ea.</P>
<P>Hayradin &s;et about building a &s;trong mole for the &s;afety of his &s;hips. In this he employed thirty thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;laves, whom he obliged to work, without intermi&s;&s;ion, for three years, in which time the work was completed. Hayradin &s;oon became dreaded not only by the Arabs and Moors, but al&s;o by the maritime Chri&s;tian powers, e&s;pecially the Spaniards. The viceroy failed not to acquaint the grand &s;eignior with his &s;ucce&s;s, and obtained from him a fre&s;h &s;upply of money, by which he was enabled to build &s;trong forts, and to erect batteries on all places that might favour the landing of an enemy. All the&s;e have &s;ince received greater improvements from time to time, as often as there was occa&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>In the mean time the &s;ultan, either out of a &s;en&s;e of the great &s;ervices of Hayradin, or perhaps out of jealou&s;y le&s;t he &s;hould make him&s;elf independent, rai&s;ed him to the dignity of ba&s;haw of the empire, and appointed Ha&s;&s;an-Aga, a Sardinian rene|gado, to &s;ucceed him as ba&s;haw of Algiers. Ha&s;&s;an had no &s;ooner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new government, than he began to pur&s;ue his ravages on the Spani&s;h coa&s;t with greater fury than ever; extending them to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, and other parts of Italy. Pope Paul III. alarmed at this proceeding, exhorted the emperor Charles V&punc; to &s;end a powerful fleet to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e frequent piracies: and, that nothing might be wanting to ren|der the enterprize &s;ucce&s;sful, a bull was publi&s;hed by his holi|ne&s;s, wherein a plenary ab&s;olution of &s;ins, and the crown of
<PB N="19" REF="026733_0020_0FD1AD11D95B9B90">
martyrdom, were promi&s;ed to all tho&s;e who either fell in battle or were made &s;laves. The emperor, on his part, needed no incitement, and therefore &s;et &s;ail at the head of a powerful fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of an hundred and twenty &s;hips and twenty gallies, having on board thirty thou&s;and troops, with an immen&s;e quantity of arms and ammunition. In this expedition, many young nobility and gentlemen attended as volunteers, and a|mong the&s;e many knights of Malta, &s;o remarkable for their va|lour again&s;t the enemies of Chri&s;tianity. Even ladies of birth and character attended Charles, and the wives and daughters of the officers and &s;oldiers followed him with a de&s;ign to &s;ettle in Barbary, after the conque&s;t was fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>By this prodigious armament, the Algerines were thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. The city was &s;urrounded only by a wall with &s;carce any out-works. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of eight hundred Turks and &s;ix thou&s;and Moors, without fire-arms, and poorly di&s;ciplined and accoutred; the re&s;t of their forces being di&s;per&s;ed in the other provinces of the king|dom, to levy the u&s;ual tribute on the Arabs and Moors. The Spa|niards landed without oppo&s;ition, and immediately built a fort, under the cannon of which they encamped, and diverted the cour&s;e of a &s;pring which &s;upplied the city with water. Being now reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, Ha&s;&s;an received a &s;ummons to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, on pain of being put to the &s;word with all his garri&s;on. The herald was ordered to extol the va&s;t power of the emperor both by &s;ea and land, and to exhort him to return to the Chri&s;tian religion. But to this Ha&s;&s;an only replied, that he mu&s;t be a madman, who would pretend to advi&s;e an enemy, and that the per&s;on advi&s;ed would act &s;till more madly who would take coun&s;el of &s;uch an advi&s;er. He was, however, on the point of &s;urrendering the city, when intelligence was brought him that the forces belonging to the we&s;tern government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was re&s;olved to defend it to the utmo&s;t. Charles, in the mean time, re&s;olving upon a general a&s;&s;ault, kept a con&s;tant firing on the town; which, from the weak defence made by the garri&s;on, he looked upon as already in his hands. But while the divan were deliberating on the mo&s;t proper means of obtaining an honourable capitulation, a mad pro|phet, attended by a multitude of people, entered the a&s;&s;embly, and foretold the de&s;truction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhorting the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was &s;oon accompli&s;hed in a very &s;ur|pri&s;ing and unexpected manner; for, on the 28th of October 1541, a dreadful &s;torm of wind, rain, and hail, aro&s;e from the north, accompanied with violent &s;hocks of earthquakes,
<PB N="20" REF="026733_0021_0FD1AD14921A4700">
and a di&s;mal and univer&s;al darkne&s;s both by &s;ea and land; &s;o that the &s;un, moon, and elements, &s;eemed to combine to|gether for the de&s;truction of the Spaniards. In that one night, &s;ome &s;ay in le&s;s than half an hour, eighty-&s;ix &s;hips and fifteen gallies were de&s;troyed, with all their crews and military &s;tores; by which the army on &s;hore was deprived of all means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. Their camp al&s;o, which &s;pread it&s;elf along the plain under their fort, was laid quite under water by the torrents which de&s;cended from the neighbouring hills. Many of the troops, by trying to remove into &s;ome better &s;ituation, were cut to pieces by the Moors and Arabs; while &s;everal gallies, and other ve&s;&s;els, endeavouring to gain &s;ome neighbouring creeks along the coa&s;t, were immediately plundered, and their crews ma&s;&s;acred by the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Next morning, Charles beheld the &s;ea covered with the fragments of &s;hips, and the bodies of men, hor&s;es, and other creatures, &s;wimming on the waves; at which he was &s;o di&s;|heartened, that abandoning his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, to the enemy, he marched at the head of his army, in no &s;mall di&s;order, towards Cape Mallabux, in order to reimbark in tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which had out-weathered the &s;torm. But Ha&s;&s;an, who had watched his motions, allowed him ju&s;t time to get to the &s;hore, when he &s;allied out, and attacked the Spaniards in the mid&s;t of their hurry to get into their &s;hips. He killed great numbers, and brought away a &s;till greater number of captives; after which he returned in triumph to Algiers.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the prophet Yu&s;ef, who had foretold the de&s;truction of the Spaniards, was declared the deliverer of his country, and had a con&s;iderable gratuity decreed him, with the liberty of exerci&s;ing his prophetic function unmole&s;ted. It was not long, however, before the Marabouts, and &s;ome interpreters of the law, made a &s;trong oppo&s;ition again&s;t him, remon&s;trating to the ba&s;haw, how ridiculous and &s;candalous it was to their nation, to a&s;cribe its deliverance to a poor for|tune-teller, which had been obtained by the fervent prayers of an eminent &s;aint of their own profe&s;&s;ion. But though the ba&s;haw and his divan &s;eemed out of policy, to give into this la&s;t notion, yet the impre&s;&s;ion, which the prediction of Yu&s;ef and its accompli&s;hment had made upon the minds of the com|mon people, proved too &s;trong to be eradicated; and the &s;pirit of divination and conjuring has &s;ince got into &s;uch credit among them, that not only their great &s;tate&s;men, but their prie&s;ts, marabouts, and &s;antoons, have applied them&s;elves to that &s;tudy, and dignified it with the name of Mahomet's Revelations.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="026733_0022_0FD1AD1EE04EBC98">
The Spaniards had &s;carce reached their &s;hips, when they were attacked by a fre&s;h &s;torm, in which &s;everal more of them peri&s;hed. A ve&s;&s;el in particular, containing &s;even hundred &s;oldiers, be&s;ides &s;ailors, &s;unk in the &s;ight of Charles, without a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;aving a &s;ingle man. At length with much la|bour, they reached the port of Bujeyah. They &s;tayed no longer here than till the &s;ixteenth of November, when they &s;et &s;ail for Carthagena, and reached it on the twenty-fifth of the &s;ame month. In this unfortunate expedition upwards of one hundred and twenty &s;hips and gallies were lo&s;t, with above three hundred colonels and other officers, and eight thou&s;and &s;oldiers and marines, be&s;ides tho&s;e de&s;troyed by the enemy on their reimbarkation, or drowned in the la&s;t &s;torm. The num|ber of pri&s;oners was &s;o great, that the Algerines &s;old &s;ome of them, by way of contempt, for an onion per head.</P>
<P>From this time, the Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines, in any con&s;iderable degree. In 1555, they lo&s;t the city of Bujeyah, which was taken by Salab <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Ha&s;&s;an. This commander, in 1556, &s;et out upon a new expedition, &s;u&s;pected to be again&s;t Oran; but he was &s;carcely got four leagues from Algiers, when the plague, which at that time reged violently in the city, broke out in his grom, and luckily carried him off in twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>Immediately after his death, the Algerine &s;oldiery cho&s;e a Cor&s;ican renegado, Ha&s;&s;an Cor&s;o, in his room, till they &s;hould receive further orders from the porte. He did not ac|cept of the ba&s;haw&s;hip without a good deal of difficulty, but immediately pro&s;ecuted the intended expedition again&s;t Oran, di&s;patching a me&s;&s;enger to acquaint the porte with what had happened. The army had hardly begun their ho&s;tilities again&s;t the place, when orders came from the porte, expre&s;sly forbidding Ha&s;&s;an Cor&s;o to begin the &s;iege, or, if he had begun it, enjoining him to rai&s;e it immediately, which he accord|ingly did.</P>
<P>Cor&s;o had enjoyed his dignity for four months, when Tekelli, a new ba&s;haw, arrived, as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or from Con|&s;tantinople. The Algerines re&s;olved not to admit him; but by the treachery of the Levantine &s;oldiers, he at la&s;t entered. Cor&s;o was thown over a wall, in which a number of iron hooks were fixed. One of the&s;e catching the ribs of his &s;ide, he hung three days in horrid agony before he expired. <Q>We meet with events in the annals of mankind, that make us doubt the truth of the mo&s;t authentic hi&s;tory.

<P>Tekelli was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated under the dome of a &s;aint, by Yu&s;ef Calabres, the favourite renegado of Ha&s;&s;an Cor&s;o. The mur|derer was cho&s;en ba&s;haw, but died of the plague, &s;ix days after his election.</P>
<P>Yu&s;ef was &s;ucceeded by Ha&s;&s;an the &s;on of Hayradin Barba|ro&s;&s;a. Not long after, the Spaniards undertook an expedi|tion again&s;t Mo&s;tagan under the command of the count d'Alcandela, but were utterly defeated, the commander him|&s;elf killed, and twelve thou&s;and men taken pri&s;oners. Ha&s;&s;an having di&s;obliged his &s;ubjects, they &s;ent him in irons to Con|&s;tantinople, while two Turki&s;h officers &s;upplied his place. Ha&s;&s;an cleared him&s;elf; but Achmet, a new ba&s;haw, was ap|pointed. Upon his arrival at Algiers, he &s;ent the two deputy ba&s;haws to Con&s;tantinople, where their heads were &s;truck off. Achmet, in four months, died; and Ha&s;&s;an was &s;ent a third time viceroy to Algiers.</P>
<P>He &s;oon engaged in the &s;iege of Mar&s;alquiver, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards, and &s;ituated near the city of Oran. The Turki&s;h &s;tandards were &s;everal times planted on the walls, and as often di&s;lodged; but in the end Ha&s;&s;an was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege.</P>
<P>In 1567, Ha&s;&s;an was again recalled to Con&s;tantinople. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Mahomet, incorporated the Jani&s;aries and Le|vantine Turks together. He thus put an end to their di&s;&s;en|tions, and laid the foundation of the Algerine independency on the porte. He likewi&s;e added &s;ome con&s;iderable fortifica|tions to the city and ca&s;tle, which he de&s;igned to render im|pregnable. At this time, one John Ga&s;con, a bold Spani&s;h adventurer, formed a de&s;ign of &s;urpri&s;ing the whole piratic navy in the bay, and &s;etting them on fire in the night time. He had the permi&s;&s;ion of Philip II. and was furni&s;hed by him with ve&s;&s;els, mariners, and fire-works, for the execution of his plan. He &s;et &s;ail for Algiers in the beginning of October, when mo&s;t, if not all the &s;hips lay at anchor there; and ad|vanced near enough, un&s;u&s;pected, to view them. He came accordingly, unperceived by any, to the very mole gate, and di&s;patched his men with their fire-works; but the&s;e were &s;o ill mixed, that they could not be kindled. Ga&s;con finding him&s;elf di&s;covered, and in the utmo&s;t danger, &s;ailed away with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te; but he was pur&s;ued, overtaken, and brought back a pri&s;oner. Mahomet immediately cau&s;ed a gibbet to be erected on the &s;pot where Ga&s;con had landed, and hung
<PB N="23" REF="026733_0024_0FD1AD241C086440">
him by the feet upon a hook, with his royal commi&s;&s;ion tied to his toes. He had not been long &s;u&s;pended, when the cap|tain who made him pri&s;oner, and a number of other cor&s;airs, interceded &s;o &s;trongly in his behalf, that he was taken down, and put under the care of &s;ome Chri&s;tian &s;urgeons; but two days after, &s;ome Moors having reported as the common talk and belief in Spain, that the Algerines dur&s;t not hurt a hair of Ga&s;con's head, he was hoi&s;ted up by a pulley to the top of the execution wall, and thrown down again. In his fall, a hook catched him by the belly, and gave him a wound, of which he in&s;tantly expired.</P>
<P>Mahomet was &s;ucceeded by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">hali, a renegado, who re|duced the kingdom of Tunis. It remained &s;ubject to the vice|roy of Algiers only till the year 1586, when a ba&s;haw of Tu|nis was appointed by the Sultan.</P>
<P>Algiers continued to be governed, till the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, by Turki&s;h viceroys or ba&s;haws. At la&s;t, the Turki&s;h Jani&s;aries and militia becoming powerful enough to &s;uppre&s;s the tyrannic &s;way of tho&s;e ba&s;haws, they &s;ent a deputation of &s;ome of their chief members to Con&s;tantinople to complain of their rapacity. They repre&s;ented to the mini&s;try, how much more honourable it would be for the grand &s;eignior to permit them to chu&s;e their own dey, or governor, from among them&s;elves, who&s;e intere&s;t it would be to &s;ee that the revenue of the country was rightly applied in keeping up its forces complete, and in &s;upplying all other exigencies of the &s;tate, without any farther charge or trouble to the porte, than that of allowing them its protection. Algiers was to be wholly left under the direction of the dey and his divan. The power of the Turki&s;h ba&s;haw was to be reduced to a &s;hadow.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;als were accepted by the porte. The divan elected a dey from among them&s;elves. They compiled a new &s;et of laws, and made &s;everal regulations for the better &s;upport and maintenance of this new form of government. The &s;ub|&s;equent altercations that frequently happened between the ba&s;haws and deys, the one endeavouring to recover their former power, and the other to curtail it, cau&s;ed &s;uch frequent complaints and di&s;contents at the Ottoman court, as made them &s;ometimes repent of their compliance.</P>
<P>In the year 1601, the Spaniards made another attempt upon Algiers. Their fleet was driven back by contrary winds, &s;o that they came off without lo&s;s. In 1609, the Moors being expelled from Spain, flocked in great numbers to Algiers; and as many of them were very able &s;ailors, they undoubtedly contributed to make the Algerine fleet &s;o formidable as it be|came &s;oon after. In 1616, their fleet con&s;i&s;ted of forty &s;hips between two hundred and four hundred tons burthen, and
<PB N="24" REF="026733_0025_0FD1AD256A708080">
their admiral was five hundred tons. It was divided into two &s;quadrons, one of eighteen &s;ail, &s;tationed before the port of Malaga; and the other at the Cape of Santa Maria, between Li&s;bon and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; both of which attacked Chri&s;tian &s;hips, both Engli&s;h and French, with whom they pretended to be in friend&s;hip, as well as Spaniards, and Portugue&s;e, with whom they were at war</P>
<P>The Algerines were now become formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards, who were mo&s;t in danger, &s;olicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England, the Pope, and other &s;tates. The French, however, were the fir&s;t who dared to &s;hew their re|&s;entment at the perfidious behaviour of the&s;e mi&s;creants; and in 1617, M. Beaulieu was &s;ent again&s;t them with a fleet of fifty men of war. He defeated their fleet, and took two of their ve&s;&s;els. Their admiral &s;unk his own &s;hip and crew, rather than fall into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>In 1620, a &s;quadron of Engli&s;h men of war was &s;ent again&s;t Algiers, but did nothing. The Algerines, becoming more in&s;olent, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only excepted, to whom, in 1625, they &s;ent a propo&s;al, that in ca&s;e they would fit out twenty &s;ail of &s;hips in the following year, upon any &s;ervice again&s;t the Spaniards, the cor&s;airs would join them with &s;ixty &s;ail.</P>
<P>Next year, the Cologlies, or children of &s;uch Turks as had been permitted to marry at Algiers, who were inrolled in the militia, &s;eized on the citadel, and had well nigh made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city. They were attacked by the Turks and renegadoes, who defeated them with terrible &s;laughter. Numbers were executed, and their heads thrown in heaps on the city walls.</P>
<P>In 1623, the Algerines and other &s;tates of Barbary, threw off their dependence on the porte. Sultan Amurath IV. had been obliged to make a truce for twenty-five years, with the emperor Ferdinand II. As this put a &s;top to the piratical trade of the Algerines, they proceeded as above mentioned; and re&s;olved, that whoever de&s;ired to be at peace with them, mu&s;t, &s;eparately, apply to their own government. They began to make prizes of &s;everal merchant &s;hips belonging to the powers at peace with the porte. They &s;eized a Dutch &s;hip and poleacre at Scanderoon; they even ventured on &s;hore, and finding the town abandoned by the Turki&s;h aga and inhabitants, they plundered all the magazines and ware|hou&s;es, and &s;et them on fire. About this time, Louis XIII. undertook to build a fort on their coa&s;ts, in&s;tead of one for|merly built by the Mar&s;ilians, and which had been demoli&s;hed. This, after &s;ome difficulty, he accompli&s;hed; and it was
<PB N="25" REF="026733_0026_0FD1AD29DC67F518">
called the Ba&s;tion of France; but the &s;ituation being found in|convenient, the French purcha&s;ed the port of La Calle, and obtained liberty to trade with the Arabians and Moors. The Ottoman court, in the mean time, was &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ed with a Per&s;ian war, that there was no lei&s;ure to check the Algerines piracies. This gave an opportunity to the vizir and other courtiers to compound matters with the Algerines, and to get a &s;hare of the prizes, which were very con&s;iderable. For the &s;ake of form a &s;evere reprimand, accompanied with threats, was &s;ent them. They replied, that <Q>they de&s;erved to be indulged in the&s;e depredations, as they were the only bulwark again&s;t the Chri&s;tian powers, and in particular, again&s;t the Spaniards, the &s;worn enemies of the Mo&s;lem name.</Q> They added, that <Q>if they &s;hould pay a punc|tilious regard to all who could purcha&s;e liberty to trade with the Ottoman empire, they would have nothing to do but &s;et fire to their &s;hipping, and turn camel-drivers.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 16<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">5, four brothers of a family in France, en|tered into an undertaking &s;o de&s;perate, that perhaps the annals of knight-errantry can &s;carcely furni&s;h its equal. This was no le&s;s than to retort the piracies of the Algerines, upon them&s;elves; and as they indi&s;criminately took the &s;hips of all nations, &s;o were the&s;e heroes indi&s;criminately to take the &s;hips belonging to Algiers; and this with a &s;mall frigate of ten guns! An hundred volunteers embarked; a Malte&s;e commi&s;&s;ion was ob|tained, with an able ma&s;ter, and thirty mariners. On their fir&s;t &s;etting out, they took, on the Spani&s;h coa&s;t, a &s;hip laden with wine. Three days after, they engaged two large Algerine cor&s;airs, one of twenty and the other of twenty-four guns. The French made &s;o de&s;perate a re&s;i&s;tance, that the pirates were not able to take them, till five other cor&s;airs came up. The French ve&s;&s;el, being almo&s;t torn to pieces, was then boarded and taken. In 1642, the brothers redeemed them&s;elves, at the price of &s;ix thou&s;and dollars.</P>
<P>In 1637, the Algerines infe&s;ted the Briti&s;h channel; and, accordingly to Mrs. Macauley,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of England, vol. II. chap. 4.</NOTE> had made &s;uch a va&s;t number of captures, as to have at one time, between four and five thou&s;and &s;ubjects of England pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The Algerines pro&s;ecuted their piracies with impunity, to the terror and di&s;grace of Chri&s;tendom, till the year 1652; when a French fleet being accidentally driven to Algiers, the admiral took it into his head to demand a relea&s;e of all the captives of his nation without exception. This being refu&s;ed, the Frenchman without ceremony carried off the Turki&s;h vice|roy,
<PB N="26" REF="026733_0027_0FD1AD29DFBA6BD8">
and his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> or judge, who were ju&s;t arrived from the porte, with all their equipage and retinue. The Algerines, by way of repri&s;al, &s;urpri&s;ed the Ba&s;tion of France already mentioned, and carried off the inhabitants to the number of &s;ix hundred, with all their effects. Upon this, the admiral &s;ent them word, that he would pay them another vi&s;it, next year, with his whole fleet.</P>
<P>The Algerines fitted out a fleet of &s;ixteen galleys and gal|liots, under the command of Hali Pinchinin. The chief de&s;ign of this armament was again&s;t the trea&s;ure of Loretto; which they were prevented by contrary winds from obtaining. Hereupon they made a de&s;cent on Puglia in the kingdom of Naples; where they ravaged the whole territory of Necotra. They carried off a va&s;t number of captives.

<P>The Venetians, alarmed at &s;uch &s;avages, equipped a fleet of twenty-eight &s;ail, under the command of admiral Capello, with expre&s;s orders to burn, &s;ink, or take, all the Barbary cor&s;airs which he met with, either on the open &s;eas, or even in the Ottoman harbours, agreeable to a late treaty of peace with the porte. On the other hand, the captain ba&s;haw, who had been &s;ent out with a Turki&s;h fleet to cha&s;e the Flo|rentine and Malte&s;e crui&s;ers from the Archipelago, learning that the Algerine &s;quadron was &s;o near, &s;ent expre&s;s orders to the admiral to come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Pinchinin readily agreed; but he was overtaken by Capello, from whom he retired to Valona, a &s;ea port belonging to the grand &s;eignior, whi|ther the Venetian admiral pur&s;ued him; but the Turki&s;h governor refu&s;ing to turn out the pirates, according to the articles of the peace between the Ottoman court and Venice, Capello was obliged to content him&s;elf with watching them for &s;ome time. Pinchinin &s;oon ventured out, an engagement immediately en&s;ued, and the Algerines were defeated. Five of their ve&s;&s;els were di&s;abled; one thou&s;and five hundred men, Turks, and Chri&s;tian <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">aves, were killed; be&s;ides one thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred galley &s;laves who regained their liberty. Pinchinin, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where he was again watched by Capello, but the latter had not lain long at his old anchorage, before he received a letter from the &s;enate, de&s;iring him to make no farther attempt on the pirates at that time, for fear of a rupture with the porte. Ca|pello was forced to &s;ubmit; but re&s;olving to take &s;uch a leave of the Algerines as he thought they de&s;erved, ob&s;erved how they had reared their tents, and drawn their booty and equi|page along the &s;hore. He then kept firing among their tents,
<PB N="27" REF="026733_0028_0FD1AD2EC7289C70">
while &s;ome well manned galliots and brigantines were di&s;|patched to attack their &s;hipping. Sixteen gallies, with all their cannon, and &s;tores, were towed out. In this la&s;t en|gagement, a ball from one of the Venetian gallies, &s;truck a Turki&s;h mo&s;que, and hence, the whole action was con&s;idered as an in&s;ult to the grand &s;eignior. To conceal this, Capello was ordered to &s;ink all the Algerine &s;hips that he had taken, ex|cept the admiral; which was to be conducted to Venice, and laid up as a trophy. Capello received a &s;evere reprimand, and the Venetians were obliged to buy, with five hundred thou&s;and ducats, a peace from the porte.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the news of this defeat and lo&s;s filled Algiers with rage and confu&s;ion. The city was on the point of an in|&s;urrection, when the ba&s;haw publi&s;hed a proclamation, forbid|ding, not only complaints and outcries, under the &s;evere&s;t pe|nalties, but all per&s;ons whatever to take their thumbs from with|in their girdles, while they were deliberating on this &s;ubject. They applied to the porte for an order, that the Venetians &s;et|tled in the Levant, &s;hould make up their lo&s;s. But with this the grand &s;eignior refu&s;ed to comply, and left them to repair their lo&s;&s;es, and to build new &s;hips in the be&s;t manner that they could. It was not long, however, before they had the &s;atis|faction of &s;eeing one of their captains land, with a fre&s;h &s;upply of &s;ix hundred &s;laves, whom he had brought from the coa&s;t of Iceland, whither he had been directed by a mi&s;creant native taken on board a Dani&s;h &s;hip.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Pinchinin. His engagement with a Dutch &s;hip. Bombardment and de&s;truction of Algiers, by the French. Defeat of the Spaniards.</HEAD>
<P>THE pirates did not long continue in their weak and de|fencele&s;s &s;tate; being able, at the end of two years, to appear at &s;ea with a fleet of &s;ixty-five &s;ail. The Admiral Pin|chinin equipped four galliots at his own expence; with which, in conjunction with the Chiayah or &s;ecretary of the ba&s;haw of Tripoli, he made a &s;econd excur&s;ion. This &s;mall &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of five galleys and two brigantines, fell in with an Engli&s;h &s;hip of forty guns; which, however, Pinchinin's cap|tains refu&s;ed to engage, but being afterwards reproached by him for their cowardice, they &s;wore to attack the next Chri&s;|tian &s;hip that came in their way. This happened to be a Dutch merchantman, of twenty-eight guns and forty men, deeply laden, and di&s;abled by a calm from u&s;ing her &s;ails.
<PB N="28" REF="026733_0029_0FD1AD3571379FE8">
Pinchinin immediately &s;ummoned her to &s;urrender; but re|ceiving an ironical an&s;wer, drew up his &s;quadron in form of an half moon, that they might pour their &s;hot all at once into their adver&s;ary. This, however, the Dutchman avoid|ed, by means of a breeze of wind which fortunately &s;prung up and enabled him to turn his &s;hip; by which the galleys ran foul of each other. Upon this Pinchinin ran his own galley along &s;ide the merchantman, the upper deck of which &s;eventy Algerines immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, &s;ome of them cut|ting the rigging, others plying the hatches with hand-gre|nadoes; but the Dutch having &s;ecured them&s;elves in their clo&s;e quarters, began to fire at the Algerines on board, from two pieces of cannon loaded with &s;mall &s;hot; by which they were all &s;oon killed or forced to &s;ubmit. Pinchinin in the mean time made &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to relieve his men, as well as to &s;urround the Dutch with his other gallies; but their &s;hip lay &s;o deep in the water, that every &s;hot did terrible execution among the pirates; &s;o that they were obliged to remove farther off. At la&s;t the Dutch captain, having ordered his guns to be loaded with cartouches, gave them a parting volley, which killed, as it is &s;aid, two hun|dred of them, and &s;ent the re&s;t back to Algiers in a di&s;mal condition.</P>
<P>But though Pinchinin thus returned in di&s;grace, the re&s;t of the fleet quickly came back with va&s;t numbers of &s;laves, and an immen&s;e quantity of rich &s;poils; in &s;o much that the Engli&s;h, French, and Dutch, were obliged to cringe to the Algerines, who &s;ometimes conde&s;cended to be at peace with them, but &s;wore eternal war again&s;t Spain, Portugal, and Italy, whom they con&s;idered as the greate&s;t enemies to the Mahometan name. At la&s;t Lewis the fourteenth, provoked by the grievous outrages committed by the Algerines on the coa&s;ts of Provence and Lan|guedoc, ordered, in 1681, a con&s;iderable fleet to be fitted out again&s;t them, under the Marquis du Que&s;ne, vice admiral of France. His fir&s;t expedition was again&s;t a number of Tripolitan cor&s;airs; who had the good fortune to outrow him, and &s;helter them&s;elves in the i&s;land of Scio belonging to the Turks. This did not prevent him from pur&s;uing them thither, and making &s;uch a terrible fire upon them, as de&s;troyed fourteen of their ve&s;&s;els, be&s;ides battering the walls of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This &s;everity &s;eemed only to be de&s;igned as a check to the piracies of the Algerines; but, finding that they &s;till continued their outrages on the French coa&s;t, Du Que&s;ne &s;ailed in Augu&s;t, 1682, to Algiers, cannonading and bom|barding it &s;o furiou&s;ly, that, in a very &s;hort time, the whole town was in flames. The great mo&s;que was battered down,
<PB N="29" REF="026733_0030_0FD1AD3771233170">
and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es laid in ruins, &s;o that the inhabitants were on the point of abandoning the place; when, on a &s;ud|den the wind turned about, and obliged Du Que&s;ne to return to Toulon. The Algerines immediately made repri&s;als, by &s;ending a number of galleys and galliots to the coa&s;ts of Pro|vence, where they committed the mo&s;t dreadful ravages, and brought away a va&s;t number of captives; upon which a new armament was ordered to be got ready at Toulon and Mar|&s;eilles, again&s;t them the next year; and the Algerines, hav|ing received early notice, put them&s;elves into as good a &s;tate of defence as the time would allow.</P>
<P>In May, 1683, Du Que&s;ne with his &s;quadron ca&s;t anchor before Algiers; where, being joined by the marquis d'Affran|ville, at the head of five &s;trong ve&s;&s;els, it was re&s;olved to bom|bard the town next day, when accordingly, one hundred bombs were thrown into it which did terrible execution, while the be&s;ieged made &s;ome hundred di&s;charges of their can|non again&s;t the a&s;&s;ailants, without doing any con&s;iderable damage. The following night, bombs were again thrown into the city in &s;uch numbers, that the dey's palace and other great edifices were almo&s;t de&s;troyed; &s;ome of the batteries were di&s;mounted, and &s;everal ve&s;&s;els &s;unk in the port. The dey, and Turki&s;h ba&s;haw, as well as the whole &s;oldiery, alarmed at this dreadful havock, immediately &s;ued for peace. As a preliminary, the French in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;urrender of all Chri&s;tian captives who had been taken fighting under their flag, which being granted, one hundred and forty-two per|&s;ons were directly delivered up, with a promi&s;e of &s;ending on board the remainder, as &s;oon as they could be got from the different parts of the country. Accordingly Du Que&s;ne &s;ent his commi&s;&s;ary general and one of his engineers into the town; but with expre&s;s orders to in&s;i&s;t upon the delivery of all the French captives without exception, together with the effects that had been taken from the French; and that Mezomorto their then admiral, and Hali<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rais one of their captains, &s;hould be given as ho&s;tages.</P>
<P>This la&s;t demand having embarra&s;&s;ed the dey, he a&s;&s;embled the divan, and acquainted them with it. Upon this Mezomorto fell into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and told the a&s;&s;embly, that the cowardice of tho&s;e who &s;at at the helm had occa&s;ioned the ruin of Algiers; but, that for his part, he would never con&s;ent to deliver up any thing that was taken from the French. He immediately acquainted the &s;oldiery with what had pa&s;&s;ed; which &s;o exa&s;perated them, that they murdered the dey that very night, and on the morrow cho&s;e Mezomorto in his place. This was no &s;ooner done, than he cancelled all the articles of
<PB N="30" REF="026733_0031_0FD1AD38DD685DB8">
peace which had been made, and ho&s;tilities were renewed with greater fury than ever.</P>
<P>The French admiral now kept pouring in &s;uch volleys of bombs, that in le&s;s than three days, the greate&s;t part of the city was reduced to a&s;hes; and the fire burnt with &s;uch fury, that the &s;ea was enlightened for more than two leagues round. Mezomorto, unmoved by all the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, and the va&s;t numbers of the &s;lain, who&s;e blood ran in rivulets along the &s;treets; or rather, grown furious and de&s;perate, &s;ought only how to wreak his revenge on the enemy; and, not content with cau&s;ing all the French in the city to be cruelly murdered, he ordered their con&s;ul to be tied hand and foot, and fa&s;tened alive to the mouth of a mortar, from which he was &s;hot away again&s;t their navy. By this piece of inhumanity, Du Que&s;ne was &s;o exa&s;perated, that he did not leave Algiers till he had utterly de&s;troyed all their fortifications, &s;hipping, almo&s;t all the lower part, and above two thirds of the upper part of the city, which became little more than an heap of ruins.</P>
<P>The Algerines were now thoroughly convinced that they were not invincible; and, therefore, immediately &s;ent an em|ba&s;&s;y into France, begging in the mo&s;t abject terms for peace; which Lewis very &s;oon granted, to their inexpre&s;&s;ible joy. They now began to pay &s;ome regard to other nations, and to be &s;omewhat cautious how they wantonly provoked their di&s;|plea&s;ure. The fir&s;t bombardment by the French had &s;o far humbled the Algerines, that they conde&s;cended to enter into a treaty with England; which was in 1686 renewed upon terms very advantageous to the latter. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, however, that the natural perfidy of the Algerines would di&s;|appear on a &s;udden. Notwith&s;tanding this treaty, therefore, they lo&s;t no opportunity of making prizes of Engli&s;h &s;hips, when they could conveniently &s;eize them. Upon &s;ome in|fringement of this kind, captain Beach, in 1695, drove a&s;hore and burned &s;even of their frigates which produced a renewal of the treaty five years after; but it was not until the taking of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, that Britain could have a &s;ufficient check upon them to enforce the ob&s;ervation of treaties; and the&s;e have &s;ince proved &s;uch re&s;traints upon Algiers, that they &s;till continue to pay a greater deference to the Engli&s;h than to any other European power.</P>
<P>In 1708, Oran, as has been already related, was taken by the Algerines from the Spaniards, and recovered by the latter in 1732. The Turki&s;h ba&s;haw was in 1710, finally expelled.</P>
<P>Since the la&s;t &s;iege of Oran the mo&s;t remarkable event in the annals of Barbary is the attack of Algiers, by the Spaniards in the year 1775. With a conci&s;e account of that expedition, we &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter of blood.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="026733_0032_0FD1AD3B22A5B0A0">
On the 23d of June 1775, a fleet of &s;ix &s;hips of the line, twelve frigates and thirty-three other armed ve&s;&s;els &s;et &s;ail from Carthagena, in Spain, to attack Algiers. There was on board a body of troops amounting to twenty-four thou&s;and four hundred and forty-&s;even men, including infantry, caval|ry, marines, and &s;ix hundred de&s;erters de&s;tined to &s;erve as workmen. They were commanded by the count O'Reilly, a per&s;onal favourite of the late king of Spain. They had likewi&s;e for the land &s;ervice, an hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix pieces of artillery, mortars, and howitzers, with a &s;uitable quantity of military &s;tores. On the 30th of June, and 1&s;t of July, they anchored in the bay of Algiers. They ob&s;erved a large encampment, placed behind a battery, ea&s;t of the river Xarach, which runs on the ea&s;tward of the city. On the 2d of July, a council was held; and orders were given that the troops &s;hould hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to di&s;embark next morning, by day-break. But as the &s;ucceeding night was windy, and a &s;well had &s;et in from the &s;hore, the&s;e orders were counter|manded. From this day, to the 6th, there were frequent councils, violent debates, and nothing done. A quarrel broke out between O'Reilly and the Marquis de Romana, a Spani&s;h major-general, who was killed in the &s;ub&s;equent action. On the 6th, the principal officers were again a&s;&s;embled, to receive their ultimate in&s;tructions. The commander in chief warned the army, that it was the cu&s;tom of the Moors, to pretend a mo&s;t violent attack, and on the &s;malle&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, to fly with precipitation, that they might draw the enemy into an ambu&s;cade. He cautioned the troops not to break their ranks, as nothing but the force of di&s;cipline could &s;ecure them again&s;t &s;o active an enemy. He pointed out the very error which they &s;oon after committed, and the &s;nare into which they were betrayed. On landing, the army was directed to gain &s;ome heights, which were &s;uppo&s;ed requi&s;ite to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t Algiers. In the afternoon of the 6th, &s;ome &s;hips of war were ordered to fire again&s;t three batteries to the ea&s;tward of that city. This com|mi&s;&s;ion was executed with &s;o much laudable attention to the per&s;onal &s;afety of the a&s;&s;ailants, if &s;uch we may term them, that their &s;hot <HI>did not reach the &s;hore,</HI> tho&s;e of one &s;eventy-four gun &s;hip excepted. At &s;un &s;et this formidable attack cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 7th at day-break, between eight and nine thou&s;and men were put on board the boats for landing. They advanced, under the protection of &s;ome larger ve&s;&s;els very near the coa&s;t. Not a Moor appeared to oppo&s;e them; and at &s;even o'clock in the morning, they <HI>returned on board the tran&s;ports.</HI> Not a &s;hot was fired on either &s;ide, during the whole day.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="026733_0033_0FD1AD3D1F94C338">
On the 8th, at day-break, the &s;hips being &s;tationed to bat|ter the different forts to the right and left of the place of di&s;em|barkation, the troops, to the number of about eight thou&s;and, were put on board the boats; which formed in &s;ix columns. The place of landing was a league and an half to the ea&s;tward of the city of Algiers. Eighty thou&s;and Moors, of whom two thirds were cavalry, came in &s;ight, but did not attempt to op|po&s;e the landing of the Spani&s;h forces. It is &s;aid, that the whole number of Africans collected on this occa&s;ion, was not le&s;s than one hundred and fifty thou&s;and. The troops advanced into a clo&s;e country, which the Algerines had occupied in &s;mall parties. The grenadiers and light infantry of the Spaniards were repulled, and the whole body fell into confu&s;ion. In a very &s;hort time they fled, leaving behind them a great number of killed and wounded. The latter, a few excepted, were, in &s;pite of their intreaties, left to the <HI>mercy</HI> of the conquerors. Part of a &s;econd embarkation of troops added to the general confu&s;ion. A third body had ca&s;t up an entrenchment on the &s;hore, for the protection of the army. The Africans attacked it, but were driven back with great &s;laughter on both &s;ides. The Spaniards, in their gazette, acknowledged the lo&s;s of five hun|dred and twenty-one men killed, and two thou&s;and two hun|dred and &s;eventy-nine wounded. It is &s;aid, that the Algerines had between five and &s;ix thou&s;and men &s;lain on the &s;pot. The wounded Spaniards, who were left on the field of battle, were every one murdered by the enemy. The government of Algiers had offered ten zequins for the head of each Spaniard. Fifteen pieces of cannon, and three howitzers were left behind by the&s;e unfortunate invaders. The real amount of their lo&s;s can hardly have been le&s;s than three thou&s;and lives, and was perhaps con|&s;iderably greater. In the gazette of a court, we &s;eldom expect an hone&s;t reckoning of this kind. If the writer of that of Ma|drid intended us to believe that two thou&s;and two hundred and &s;eventy-nine of the wounded were brought off, the officer from who&s;e journal this account is extracted, &s;ays that a much great|er number were left behind, than were &s;aved, which makes the &s;tory wor&s;e and wor&s;e. On details of this kind, we cannot dwell with plea&s;ure. One circum&s;tance is evident, that the Spani&s;h commanders did not under&s;tand their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. State of America as to Algiers. Conduct of Britain. Con|cluding Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>IN the two la&s;t Chapters, we have &s;een the Algerines &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively &s;et at defiance, &s;everal of the mo&s;t formidable nations of Europe. When the United States of America had obtained their infant independence, it was naturally to be expected, that they al&s;o &s;hould, in &s;ome degree, &s;uffer, by the ravages of the cor&s;airs. Various circum&s;tances pointed them out, as eligible objects of piratical rapine. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an exten&s;ive trade with Europe, which in the fir&s;t place, pre&s;ented a &s;plendid temptation to plunder. There was, on the part of the Alge|rines, a &s;econd and irre&s;i&s;tible motive to ho&s;tilities. America did not &s;upport, at her national expence, any maritime force whatever; and thirdly, had &s;he even e&s;tabli&s;hed an armed navy, this country lies at the di&s;tance of more than three thou&s;and miles, from the common range of the privateers of Barbary. Hence, to reduce them to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t always require a proportion of trouble and expence greatly &s;uperior to the &s;ub|&s;tantial magnitude of the object of attack; and this remotene&s;s of our &s;ituation might be con&s;idered as an additional induce|ment to the regency of Algiers for interrupting our navigation. Of the number and &s;trength of the cor&s;airs, it is impo&s;&s;ible to give an accurate &s;tatement. Their actual force, however, compared with that which the United States could ea&s;ily fit out, is but trifling. To bring their whole &s;hips of war, at once, to a regular engagement, never can be practicable, but &s;hould it happen, it may without pre&s;umption be &s;uppo&s;ed, that fifteen or twenty American forty gun frigates would &s;end their navy to the bottom. When we reflect on the numerous and peculiar incitements which the&s;e Africans had, to commence depreda|tions on the commerce of the United States, in&s;tead of being &s;urpri&s;ed at our having &s;uffered &s;o much, it rather becomes an object of wonder that we have &s;uffered &s;o little. The late alarming intelligence from Li&s;bon has excited univer&s;al atten|tion from the public to that &s;ubject, which may be divided into two que&s;tions. Fir&s;t, why, excepting two ve&s;&s;els,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the 25th of July, 1785, the &s;chooner Maria, captain Stephens, belonging to Mr. For&s;ter, of Bo&s;ton, was taken off Cape St. Vincents, by an Algerine crui&s;er; and five days afterwards, the &s;hip Dolphin, captain O'Brien, belonging to Me&s;&s;rs. Irvines, of Philadelphia, was taken by another, fifty leagues we&s;tward of Li&s;bon. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els, with their cargoes, and crews, twenty-one in number, were carried into Algiers. Of this number two have been ran&s;omed by their friends. The remainder now reduced by death to thirteen, are yet &s;laves. In the new&s;papers about that time, two or three other &s;hips are reported as captured, but upon enquiry, the&s;e two ve&s;&s;els only appear to have been &s;o.</NOTE> have not

the &s;hips of this country met with any interruption &s;ince the end of the war with Britain? Second, why has our trade now &s;uf|fered &s;o unexpected and &s;evere a check?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the fir&s;t query, it has happened, that &s;ince the independence of North-America, the Algerines have been con|&s;tantly at war, with the Dutch, or the Portugue&s;e, or both at once; and as either of the&s;e nations is greatly &s;uperior, in regular &s;trength at &s;ea, to the cor&s;airs, they have, hitherto, for the &s;ecurity of their own commerce, watched the entrance of the Mediterranean &s;o carefully, that the cor&s;airs have been &s;eldom able to get out of it. That they &s;ometimes did &s;o, is unfortunately certain, from the fate of the two American ve&s;|&s;els above-mentioned; but, in general, they were &s;hot up in the Mediterranean as in a pri&s;on, without a po&s;&s;ibility of extending their depredations on the Atlantic ocean. Into the former, American ve&s;&s;els but &s;ometimes ventured, and when they did &s;o, they derived &s;ecurity from forged or purcha&s;ed Mediterranean pa&s;&s;es. A Briti&s;h &s;hip has for her protection a pa&s;s, which is written on a large &s;heet of parchment, and has, by way of ornament, &s;ome figures or da&s;hes drawn with a pen, or engraved on the margin. The Algerines cannot read Engli&s;h, and it would mo&s;t likely co&s;t the captain of a cor&s;air his head, were he to carry a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el, by mi&s;take, as a prize into the harbour of Algiers. They have adopted a <HI>&s;agacious</HI> contrivance to di&s;cover whether &s;uch pa&s;&s;es are genuine. They keep a &s;tick marked with notches corre&s;ponding to the &s;hape of tho&s;e figures, that are uniformly delineated on the margin of the parchment. When the pa&s;s is produced, their mea&s;ure is applied. In this was, it cannot be difficult for the mo&s;t bungling arti&s;t, who has an original pa&s;s before him, to deceive them, and, by this means, it is &s;aid, upon repu|table authority, that many ve&s;&s;els have been pre&s;erved. Be|&s;ides, even in the Mediterranean it&s;elf, the progre&s;s of the Al|gerines has been con&s;iderably cramped by the Portugue&s;e and Dutch &s;hips of war, and both the&s;e nations, as well as the Spaniards, from a regard to their own intere&s;t, as well as from the common principles of ju&s;tice and humanity, have been for|ward to extend their protection to the American flag.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the &s;econd query, this protection has, at pre|&s;ent been &s;u&s;pended, becau&s;e a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities has taken

place between Holland and Portugal on the one &s;ide, and the regency of Algiers on the other. Spain, at the &s;ame time, has been engaged in the general con&s;piracy of the Domitians and Caligulas of Europe, again&s;t the republic of France; and as this country has contracted the guilt of becoming a free nation, we likewi&s;e are involved, though, <HI>as yet,</HI> but at &s;econd hand, in the vengeance of the imperial and royal Van|dals. The cor&s;airs of Barbary are now at liberty to attack the ve&s;&s;els of the United States, not only in the Mediterranean, but al&s;o in the Atlantic ocean. From the final e&s;tabli&s;hment of American independence, &s;ome attempts are reported to have been made by the American government, to conclude a pacifi|cation with the &s;tate of Algiers, but for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, the&s;e attempts have hitherto proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. The cir|cum&s;tances which have always di&s;appointed the pacific de&s;igns of our admini&s;tration, de&s;erve to be inve&s;tigated.</P>
<P>Several of our late letters from Li&s;bon agree in a&s;&s;erting, that the pre&s;ent peace or truce between Algiers and Portugal has been formed by the officious intervention of England, without the knowledge of the latter. The &s;ame advices add, and their information is univer&s;ally believed, that this has been done by England, that the cor&s;airs of Barbary might have liberty to interrupt the commerce of this country with Europe. Since the commencement of the unfortunate war, that now &s;preads de&s;olation and bankruptcy over &s;o many countries in that quarter of the world, American bottoms, be|cau&s;e they were neutral, obtained the preference to tho&s;e of England in the carrying trade. <HI>They were not liable to be &s;eized by French privateers,</HI> and could, therefore, unmole&s;ted, tran&s;|port the commodities of any one country to any other. This advantage gave our ve&s;&s;els a decided &s;uperiority; and the ma&s;|ter of an American &s;hip frequently received twenty per cent. more for the &s;ame freight, than would be given to the ma&s;ter of an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el. This humiliating di&s;tinction alarmed the pride of the Engli&s;h nation. Dive&s;ted of the carrying trade, the naval de&s;poti&s;m of England would at once &s;hrink into nothing. The powers of Europe may reduce her to the natural level of her importance, without the expen&s;e of firing a &s;ingle gun. Let them declare, that no ve&s;&s;el of that country &s;hall bring into their harbours, any commodities but tho&s;e of Briti&s;h growth or manufacture. Her navy, which has perpe|trated &s;uch ince&s;&s;ant mi&s;chief, would then, if I may borrow the trite quotation from Shake&s;peare, vani&s;h, <HI>like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The Americans, for &s;ome time time pa&s;t, have been making rapid &s;trides towards her expul&s;ion from the carrying trade.

England could hardly venture, at this cri&s;is, to add a &s;econd republic to the catalogue of her enemies. She has, therefore, adopted the mi&s;erable expedient of turning loo&s;e the Algerines, that the&s;e execrable ruffians might plunder our property, and plunge our fellow-citizens into &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Lord Sheffield, in a pamphlet which has obtained more notice than it de&s;erved, informs the Engli&s;h nation, <Q>That it will not be the intere&s;t of any of the great maritime pow|ers, to protect the American ve&s;&s;els from the Barbary &s;tates.</Q> This benevolent remark has received a proper an&s;wer from the author of "Ob&s;ervations" on his lord&s;hip's pamphlet. The moderation of &s;tile, the candour of rea&s;oning, and the un|que&s;tioned authenticity of the facts advanced by Mr. Coxe, de&s;erve, in an uncommon degree, the attention, and the gra|titude of his countrymen.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the peace &s;o maliciou&s;ly patched up through the interference of the Briti&s;h, con&s;iderable havoc has been made on the American commerce, a number of our ve&s;&s;els having been taken, and the crews, to the number of above 130, carried into the mo&s;t cruel &s;lavery. The whole of the&s;e depre|dations were committed in the month of October and November 1793. Shortly afterwards, the court of Portugal ordered its ve&s;&s;els on their old &s;tation, and &s;ince that time, they have kept the cor&s;airs within the &s;traits, and pre&s;erved our ve&s;&s;els from their rapine.</P>
<P>When the news of the misfortune of &s;o many of our citizens arrived in America, the &s;ympathy of the public was excited to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree. Committees were appointed in &s;e|veral places to collect money, for their relief, if not for their ran&s;om. The committee appointed in Philadelphia for this purpo&s;e, received con&s;iderable &s;ums; from the managers of the new theatre alone nearly one thou&s;and dollars. But humanity has to deplore, that a mo&s;t unaccountable torpor has taken place of benevolence and charity on this trying occa&s;ion. Curio&s;ity has in vain exerted it&s;elf to di&s;cover, why a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o extremely in|tere&s;ting, and undertaken with &s;o much ardour, has utterly died away, and even &s;eemed to have been obliterated from public recollection!</P>
<P>During the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, an act was pa&s;&s;ed em|powering the Pre&s;ident to purcha&s;e, or cau&s;e to be built, a number of ve&s;&s;els for the defence of the commerce of the United States again&s;t the Algerines. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els are now building&mdash;and it is hoped, from the excellence of their con&s;truction, and the acknowledged abilities of the gentlemen appointed to com|mand them, that &s;hould they ever meet any of tho&s;e dete&s;table pirates, they will fully avenge the injured honour of America.</P>

In this &s;ituation, we were obliged to lay on deck; the people they let go below, and Mr. Barry by &s;ome means or other, got below for two nights&mdash;I was forced to lay on the poop, and the wind being at E.

In this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">|tion we continued eight days.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t we arrived at Algiers we thought our&s;elves hardly treated on board the cruizer; but al&s;o, our &s;orrows were but com|ing on; for we were not on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, when they almo&s;t loaded us with irons, and the &s;econd day <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to work like criminals, and murderers: we are in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">bject &s;lavery ever people were, in the world.

<P>THE 28th ult. we had the plea&s;ure of acquainting you of the no|velty of the truce made by this court with the regency of Al|giers, for 12 months, and as &s;uch their cruizers at liberty to cruize without re&s;traint of the others as hitherto, which they are actually doing, and no le&s;s than 8 of their cor&s;airs pa&s;&s;ed into the ocean; &s;ome reports make them 16 &s;ail; but we are happy to inform you, that hitherto they have met with little &s;ucce&s;s, for we find they cap|tured only one large American &s;hip, bound to Barcelona for Spani&s;h account&mdash;name or where loaded unknown; and this we are advi&s;ed from Gibraltar, under the 28th ult. One letter &s;ays &s;he was in Tan|giers, and another that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed up e&s;corted by two xebooks; whe|ther the&s;e advices mean one or two ve&s;&s;els, we are at a lo&s;s to determine, for want of further explanation. It is reported four more Americans are captured, but as yet no particulars are mentioned, and our letters by this day's po&s;t from Cadiz and other ports, are quite &s;ilent on this head. We con&s;ider and hope the reports ill grounded and &s;pread by de&s;igning per&s;ons for intere&s;ted purpo&s;es, and have the &s;ati&s;faction to advi&s;e you that a number of American ve&s;&s;els are &s;afe arrived at this and the ports in Spain; as to their return home, they are free of be|ing captured, as this court and that of Spain, grant them convoys to a certain latitude, whence they are clear of the cor&s;airs, who&s;e cruizing &s;tation we learn is between Cape St. Vincents and the We&s;tern I&s;lands; and the ve&s;&s;els coming to the&s;e markets &s;hould &s;teer a con|trary cour&s;e, and make Cape Fini&s;ter their fir&s;t land, and from thence coa&s;t it to their re&s;pective de&s;tinations: be&s;ides, as the winter ap|proaches, the&s;e rovers will &s;kulk home, for they will not venture to keep in the ocean during the rough months, being un&s;kilful naviga|tors, and their ve&s;&s;els ill calculated to work in the&s;e &s;eas; &s;o that, during this &s;ea&s;on there will be no great ri&s;k in calling on us to try this market.</P>

<P>WE have ju&s;t received the inclo&s;ed letter by a Portugue&s;e frigate: it is we pre&s;ume from Captain M'Shane, who had the mi&s;|fortune of being captured near the mouth of the Streights, by an Algerine cruizer, and carried a &s;lave to Algiers.&mdash;We feel very much for him, and all the Americans who have fallen victims to the dete&s;ted rovers, and it will give us plea&s;ure to alleviate their unfortunate &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="026733_0040_0FD1AD55801EBF18">
We are &s;orry to inform you, that on the 5th of November, to the date of Captain M'Shane's letter, there were 120 to 130 poor Ame|ricans in &s;lavery; and this is not the wor&s;t, the piratical beings came out again into the Atlantic the 29th ult. in &s;earch of more plunder, and we fear they will do further mi&s;chief. Their cruizing now is contrary to their old &s;y&s;tem of retiring from the ocean in November, and coming out in April; but they never did much harm to the Portugue&s;e, for &s;ince our re&s;idence in this city, half a century, they captured but three brigs, one &s;hip, and three or four &s;chooners, and carried them into Algiers. We hope the United States will &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;h a force to keep tho&s;e pirates from ever entering the Atlantic again.</P>

<P>ON the 18th October, about five leagues from Gibraltar, we were boarded by a zebecque of 20 guns, belonging to this place, who after coming within mu&s;ket-&s;hot, kept up a con&s;tant firing with &s;mall arms, until they manned our yards from theirs, then the firing cea&s;ed, and they came down &s;word in hand, &s;pared our lives, but nothing el&s;e, having &s;tripped us of the clothes we had on, and put us on board the zebecque, which brought us to this place on the 30th ult. when we were taken before the dey, from thence to the canyon, where the &s;laves are kept locked up at night: next day we were all &s;ent to the marine, and kept at hard labor from day light till dark, with an iron chain which reaches from our legs to our hips; about 50lb. weight, and treated with great &s;everity by our ma&s;ters, who allow us nothing but bread and water for our &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance. The wheel-barrow men in your city lived a genteel life to what we do.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation is truly &s;hocking&mdash;and how long we can exi&s;t, God only knows. The carpenter, John M'Farlane, a Scotchman, was taken out of the marine, by the Briti&s;h con&s;ul&mdash;the &s;ail-maker, John Fogereaux, and two Spaniards, G. Romeo and B. Gazona, were &s;old at public auction. On the evening of the &s;ame day, I arrived here, the following ma&s;ters with their crews were brought in&mdash;Captains Wallace, Virginia; Newman, Bo&s;ton; Taylor, Rhode-I&s;land; Furnace, New-Hamp&s;hire: Calder, Glouce&s;ter; Burnham, New-York; Bailey, New bury; Mo&s;s, ditto; Penro&s;e, Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The whole number of Americans is between 120 and 130. They treat the Dutch in the &s;ame manner they do us.&mdash;Captain O'Brian and Stephens, with their crews are here, ten of them are living, the re&s;t dead.&mdash;If their &s;mall number could not be redeemed, we

have no hopes of relief; therefore endeavour to make our&s;elves as happy as po&s;&s;ible: they a&s;k for my ran&s;om 4000 dollars, fir&s;t and &s;econd mate, 3000 dollars each, and for each man, 1500 dollars. If a peace is not made, or our &s;hips protected, we may expect to encrea&s;e daily as we are all employed in the marine department, fitting out cruizers. I have not yet learned their force; but as there is no check on them, no American ve&s;&s;el will be able to go to Europe in &s;afety.

<HEAD>No. V. Copy of a letter from captain O'Brien, to James Simp&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> at Gibraltar, dated Algiers, the 28th November, 1793.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR letter of the 12th in&s;t. I received the 25th. It is a long period &s;ince I heard from you; but I hope you will be this way &s;hortly from Toulon.</P>
<P>The Algerines, in their October expedition, captured ten &s;ail of American ve&s;&s;els; nine of them have &s;afely arrived. The crews of the&s;e ten ve&s;&s;els, amounting to 102, are at pre&s;ent in Algiers, experi|encing what we have &s;uffered for upwards of eight years.&mdash;I have repeatedly, for the&s;e five years pa&s;t, forewarned the United States of the impending danger; for the Portugue&s;e have been trying a long time to effect a peace with Algiers; but the Americans in general would put but little confidence in the a&s;&s;ertions of a poor victim cap|tive; but they now find that they contained the truth.</P>
<P>On the 11th in&s;tant, Mr. Humphreys, the Amba&s;&s;ador for Algiers, &s;ent hither a courier to obtain the dey's permi&s;&s;ion to come hither in order to make peace. The dey an&s;wered, that he would not receive him, either to make peace or redeem the American &s;laves&mdash;that he had been &s;oliciting the Americans to come and make a peace with this regency for three years pa&s;t, and they had treated his pro|po&s;itions with neglect and indifference; and that &s;ince he had made a truce with the Dutch and Portugue&s;e, and captured ten &s;ail of Americans, and likely to take many more, he could not and would not make peace with them: that he made the truce with Portugal for the purpo&s;e of capturing American ve&s;&s;els, and could not there|fore be at peace with all nations. The courier returned to Mr. Humphreys at Alicant with the dey's reply&mdash;but we have heard no|thing more &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="026733_0042_0FD1AD5C37C28940">
The terms pre&s;cribed by the dey for the relief of the Portugue&s;e, is as follows: 1,200,000 Mexican dollars for the trea&s;ury; 600,000 dollars for the dey's voice and the great officers, of the regency, am|ba&s;&s;adorial and con&s;ular pre&s;ents&mdash;equal to what Spain gave; and the redemption of 75 Portugue&s;e captains, at 2000 dollars each. On the 7th in&s;t. the Portugue&s;e frigate &s;ailed from Algiers for Li&s;|bon, with the dey's propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>The day following the dey called captain Logie, and de&s;ired he would immediately write to Portugal, that he demanded for his family and friends 600,000 dollars in addition to the terms above expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Algerine politicians are of opinion, that Portugal will not agree to the dey's demands; but, &s;ir, I think they will, as they wi&s;h to extend their commerce, and well know the difficulty of blocking up the Streights, and the va&s;t &s;ums they expend in keeping up the fleets again&s;t the Barbary States.</P>
<P>The Dutch truce will expire in twelve days from this date; and if Van Trump is not here in the limited time, away go the rovers in que&s;t of Dutchmen.</P>
<P>The Danes, in my opinion, are on the verge of lo&s;ing their peace with Algiers. Should the&s;e three nations be baffled, relative to Alge|rine affairs, then the United States might probably have an oppor|tunity of e&s;tabli&s;hing a peace; but never on &s;o favourable terms as they might have had three years pa&s;t; which neglect will co&s;t them four millions, together with lo&s;s of trade, in&s;urance, armaments, and peace redemptions. At all events, the United States have no alternative but to fit out twelve of the be&s;t &s;ailing ve&s;&s;els that can po&s;&s;ibly be built; the&s;e cruizers to be properly appointed and complete|ly manned, for all depends on this mea&s;ure. At the &s;ame time, the door for obtaining a peace &s;hould be kept open, and care taken that the United States do not become the dupe and buffoon of all Europe.</P>

<P>We tru&s;t, and hope, that the United States will adopt &s;uch ef|fectual plans, in order to prevent any more of our brethren, &s;haring our unhappy fate, which unavoidably mu&s;t happen, if &s;ome &s;peedy and deci&s;ive means is not immediately put in execution, as we under|&s;tand the Portugue&s;e truce, with this regency, was agreed on for one year.</P>
<P>What damps our &s;prits in &s;ome degree, is, that we are informed, that the plague, that fatal and tremendous di&s;order, has given its awful alarm in the country adjacent.

<P>I HAVE been favoured by the receipt of your joint letter, dated 29th December, and, as I am about to &s;et out immediately for Li&s;bon, I &s;hall be able to do little more than a&s;&s;ure you that your memorials to the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States &s;hall be forwarded to them in the earlie&s;t and &s;afe&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Having communicated to Mr. Carmichael, and Mr. Short, your apprehen&s;ion that the plague may again be introduced to Algiers, from the adjacent countries, where it is already &s;aid to prevail; we have not he&s;itated to concur with you in &s;entiment, that in ca&s;e of that dreadful event, it might be u&s;eful for you to have a hou&s;e hired in the country; in order to endeavour, by all human precau|tions, to prevent your falling victims to that terrible di&s;order. Whereupon Mr. Robert Montgomery, con&s;ul of the United States, at Alicant, has been empowered, in ca&s;e that dreadful event &s;hould happen, to furni&s;h &s;ufficient money to pay for the hire of a hou&s;e, in the manner, and for the purpo&s;e you propo&s;e. This provi&s;ional ar|rangement to continue in force, until Mr. Montgomery &s;hall receive ulterior in&s;tructions from the government of the United States, for continuing or &s;u&s;pending the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I entreat you will be per&s;uaded, my dear and unfortunate coun|trymen, that I receive with great &s;ati&s;faction the marks of your ap|probation, of the hone&s;t, but ineffectual efforts I have made in your favor. Would to Heaven, they had been as &s;ucce&s;sful, as they were di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;incere.</P>

<P>P. S. Though I have repeatedly remarked, that it may perhaps, (for particular rea&s;ons) be inexpedient for me to keep up a regular corre&s;pondence with you; yet it is proper I &s;hould add, that I &s;hall always be glad to hear from you; and that it may be particularly intere&s;ting to the government of our country, to receive at the earlie&s;t po&s;&s;ible period, all intelligence of importance. I &s;hall therefore always be ready to communicate &s;uch intelligence, until &s;ome nearer, and better channel of communication can be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>No. VIII. Treatment of the American Pri&s;oners at Algiers.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the people of the United States, anxious to pre&s;erve their liberty at home, they cannot be unconcerned at knowing the hard fate of tho&s;e of their countrymen, who, by being expo&s;ed to the &s;evere and perilous duties of the &s;ea, are rendered at the &s;ame time ob|noxious to, and many of them actually enduring the hard condition of &s;laves, to the mo&s;t ferocious enemies to humanity.</P>
<P>Captain Laurence, of the Hull Packet, was de&s;irous of obtaining the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentic information, re&s;pecting the condition of his unfortunate countrymen in Algiers, obtained it at Cadiz, and now re&s;pectfully lays it before the American people.&mdash; The Americans taken by the Algerines, have their heads clo&s;e &s;haved; nor are they allowed to wear any kind of covering on the head: they are entirely &s;tript of their apparel, and a coar&s;e dre&s;s given in&s;tead of it. At night they are confined in a dungeon, and at day-light led in chains to their u&s;ual work, which is generally rigging and fitting &s;hips; &s;ome are &s;ent as navigators and pilots on board the cruizers, and are obliged, on pain of puni&s;hment, to exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t of their abilities.</P>
<P>Their food is generally bread and water, nor is the lea&s;t difference made between &s;ick and well, officers and men, but all treated equally ill. It was reported at Cadiz, that there were &s;everal European na|vigators lately gone among them; particularly one Kelly, who was tried in Dublin for piracy; and that they were determined to &s;cour the we&s;tern ocean next &s;pring. The Hull Packet left Cadiz with an Engli&s;h fleet, under convoy of a frigate and &s;loop of war. A few days after leaving that place, two &s;ail pa&s;&s;ed the fleet, &s;teering in for the Streights, the &s;loop of war gave chace and &s;poke them; and cap|tain Laurence was informed they were an Algerine cruizer, and an American &s;hip, her prize.</P>

<L>Now helmle&s;s &s;hips in devious routes are driv'n,</L>
<L>The cordage torn, the ma&s;ts to atoms riv'n:</L>
<L>Now here they glow with curling waves of fire,</L>
<L>In one explo&s;ion total crews expire.</L>
<L>Here barks relinqui&s;h'd, burnt to ocean's brink,</L>
<L>Half veil'd in crim&s;on clouds begin to &s;ink.</L>
<L>With men &s;ubmerg'd, there frailer fragments float,</L>
<L>Here yawning gulfs ab&s;orb th' o'erloaded boat:</L>
<L>There red-hot balls, that graze the waters, hi&s;s,</L>
<L>And plunge the gallies down the dread aby&s;s.</L>
<L>Here &s;hatter'd limbs&mdash;there garments dipt in blood,</L>
<L>With mingling crim&s;on &s;tain the foughten flood,</L>
<L>While Afric's pirates, &s;hrinking from the day,</L>
<L>By terror urg'd, drag wounded hulks away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when two adver&s;e &s;torms impetuous driv'n,</L>
<L>From ea&s;t and we&s;t, &s;ail up the azure heav'n,</L>

In flaming field of day together run,</L>
<L>Explode their fires, and blot with night the &s;un&mdash;</L>
<L>The ea&s;tern cloud, its flames expir'd at la&s;t,</L>
<L>Flies from the light'ning of the we&s;tern bla&s;t:</L>
<L>So fled the cor&s;air line the blightning &s;troke</L>
<L>Of freedom's thunder&mdash;&s;o their battle broke&mdash;</L>
<L>As if by heav'n's own arm &s;ubdu'd at length,</L>
<L>Their courage peri&s;h'd, wither'd all their &s;trength.</L>
</LG>

<L>Oh then let vict'ry &s;timulate the chace,</L>
<L>To free from &s;hameful chains the human race,</L>
<L>To drive the&s;e pirates from th' in&s;ulted waves,</L>
<L>To ope their dungeons to de&s;pairing &s;laves,</L>
<L>To &s;natch from impious hands and break the rod,</L>

<L>Woe to proud Algiers; to your princes woe!</L>
<L>Your pride is falling with your youths laid low&mdash;</L>
<L>Woe to ye people, woe, di&s;tre&s;s, and fears!</L>
<L>Your hour is come to drink the cup of tears:</L>

<L>In triumph ride th' avengers of the waves.</L>

<L>Where anxious crouds in expectation &s;tand,</L>
<L>See raptur'd nations hail the kindred race,</L>
<L>And court the heroes to their fond embrace:</L>
<L>In fond embraces &s;train'd, the captive clings,</L>
<L>And feels and looks unutterable things.</L>
<L>See there the widow finds her darling &s;on,</L>
<L>See in each others' arms the lovers run,</L>
<L>With joy tumultuous their &s;woll'n bo&s;oms glow,</L>
<L>And one &s;hort moment pays for years of woe!</L>

<P>SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE MALIGNANT FEVER,
Lately prevalent at Philadelphia, with a &s;tatement of the proceedings that took place on the &s;ubject, in different parts of the United States.

<P>AMERICAN MUSEUM. From its commencement in January, 1787, to its termination in December, 1792. Twelve volumes, 8vo. Price nineteen dollars and one fifth.</P>
<P>"The American Mu&s;eum is not only eminently calculated to di&s;|&s;eminate political, agricultural, philo&s;ophical, and other valuable information&mdash;but it has been uniformly conducted with ta&s;te, atten|tion, and propriety. If to the&s;e important objects be &s;uperadded the more immediate de&s;ign, of re&s;cuing public documents from oblivion, I will venture to pronounce, as my &s;entiment, that a more u&s;eful literary plan has never been undertaken in America, nor one more de&s;erving of public encouragement."
GEN. WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>YOUNG MISSES' MAGAZINE. Containing&mdash;Dialogues between a governe&s;s and &s;everal young ladies of quality, her &s;cholars;&mdash;in which each lady is made to &s;peak according to her particular genius, temper, and inclination.&mdash;Their &s;everal faults are pointed out, and the ea&s;y way to amend them, as well as to think, and &s;peak, and act properly; no le&s;s care being taken to form their hearts to goodne&s;s, than to enlighten their under&s;tanding with u&s;eful know|ledge. A &s;hort and clear abridgment is al&s;o given of &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory, and &s;ome le&s;&s;ons in geography. The u&s;eful is blended throughout with the agreeable; the whole being inter|&s;per&s;ed with proper reflections and moral tales. Price one dollar, thirty-three cents.</P>

<P>"IT may be a Tale of Truth, for it is not unnatural, and it is a tale of real di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;Charlotte, by the artifice of a teacher, recom|mended to a &s;chool, from humanity rather than a conviction of her integrity, or the regularity of her former conduct, is enticed from her governe&s;s, and accompanies a young officer to America.&mdash;The marriage ceremony, if not forgotten, is po&s;tponed, and Charlotte dies a martyr to the incon&s;tancy of her lover, and treachery of his friend. The &s;ituations are artle&s;s and affecting&mdash;the de&s;cription natural and pathetic; we &s;hould feel for Charlotte if &s;uch a per&s;on ever exi&s;ted, who for one error, &s;carcely, perhaps, de&s;erved &s;o &s;evere a puni&s;hment. If it is a fiction; poetic ju&s;tice is not, we think, properly di&s;tributed." Critical Review, vol. i. p. 468.</P>
