<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE <HI>been a reader of the u&s;eful publications for children with which the world abounds, till I feel my|&s;elf in&s;pired with emulation, to devote my own lei&s;ure hours to the &s;ame benevolent purpo&s;e, that &s;o properly em|ploys the pens of many of my &s;ex. The ladies who are already engaged in furni&s;hing a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of books, fit for children in their</HI> early <HI>years, &s;eem to &s;tand in no need of an auxiliary; being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, both of talents, and indu&s;|try, equal to their laudable undertaking; nor do I wi&s;h to invade their province; but, as I ob&s;erve, that the&s;e re&s;pectable writers content them&s;elves with conducting their pupils to a cerain period; I think I may with pro|priety</HI> follow <HI>them, and offer &s;ome hints to young ladies preparatory to (what they are too apt to regard as the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of liberty) the time of their leaving &s;chool; when numbers of unexperienced young per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;e them|&s;elves capable of forming ju&s;t opinions of people and things, and of regulating their own conduct.</HI></P>
<P><HI>With a view of preventing, in &s;ome degree, this impro|per</HI> SELF-CONFIDENCE, <HI>which naturally produces pride, impatient of controul, and various other intellectual de|formities, I have projected a de&s;ign of pre&s;enting to the public, a few dome&s;tic &s;cenes; calculated to &s;hew, the happy effects of</HI> filial affection, &s;weetne&s;s of temper, <HI>and</HI> &s;teadine&s;s of mind, <HI>when exerci&s;ed in the</HI> &s;ea&s;on of YOUTH, <HI>towards either</HI> good <HI>or</HI> bad <HI>parents.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Were all per&s;ons to di&s;charge their duty to their offs|pring, it would be</HI> unju&s;t <HI>to exhibit, even fictitious cha|racters of parents in an unamiable light; and it certainly is commendable, in every one concerned in the education of children, to throw a veil over the imperfections of tho&s;e, whom nature and religion require to be honored and obey|ed. But it mu&s;t be acknowledged and lamended, that many parents indulge them&s;elves in faults, which are
<PB N="iv" REF="023336_0003_0FBEFF1474C458B8">
productive of much unhappine&s;s to their families <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> faults, which they an nor &s;trive to</HI> hide, <HI>and are therefore</HI> una|voidably <HI>di&s;covered to their children; as &s;oon as they are permitted to</HI> dwell <HI>under the paternal roof, from whence they are almo&s;t totally excluded, till they are old enough to di&s;tingui&s;h characters: the effect of this is, that many an</HI> amiable <HI>girl, when &s;he returns from &s;chool, where &s;he has been accu&s;tomed to practi&s;e regularity, and receive good in&s;truction, is continually at a lo&s;s how to act at home, where &s;he &s;ees nothing but</HI> idlene&s;s, di&s;&s;ipation, pa&s;&s;ion <HI>and</HI> fretfulne&s;s; <HI>and con&s;equently through the in&s;inuations of &s;ervants, or the incon&s;iderate a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of</HI> young <HI>friends, may be induced to think that &s;he is</HI> excu&s;able <HI>for omit|ting to pay attention and obedience to the&s;e, who neglect to act a parent's part. Would it not, therefore, be a be|nevolent office, in tho&s;e who &s;uperintend the education of</HI> female <HI>youth in particular,</HI> prudently <HI>to prepare them for the conflicts they may be engaged in, by &s;trongly inculca|ting the duty of a daughter in its almo&s;t extent; and en|forcing a per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ion that their felicity principally depends on rectitude of their</HI> own <HI>conduct; that they may be for|tified to bear, with dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the many evils which the improper behavior of</HI> bad <HI>parents may expo&s;e them to; or learn to feel the comforts of their &s;ituation, of they are ble&s;&s;ed with</HI> good <HI>ones?</HI></P>
<P>SECOND MARRIAGES, <HI>though in many ca&s;es highly expedient, are frequently productive of family di&s;cord; for children are u&s;ually, by &s;ome means or other, preju|diced again&s;t a mother-in-law; and di&s;inclined to obey or re&s;pect her. I have therefore fixed on this as the &s;ub|ject of the pre&s;ent Volume; and have adapted the</HI> drama|tic &s;tyle, <HI>as mo&s;t likely to engage attention.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the fir&s;t of the following little pieces I have attempt|ed to &s;hew</HI> what kind of behavior is mo&s;t likely to pro|duce harmony, where all parties have good &s;en&s;e and good di&s;po&s;itions: <HI>and in the &s;econd to point out,</HI> that affection for a parent &s;hould guard young minds from revolting again&s;t him, even &s;hould he form a di&s;agreea|ble connection.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="023336_0004_0FBEFF15EE573C48">
<HI>If my labors are honored with the approbation of the public, I &s;hall pur&s;ue my plan, with the hope, that the le&s;|&s;ons I inculcate may be conducive towards e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch habits of</HI> patience, meekne&s;s <HI>and</HI> complacency, <HI>as are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to render young ladies</HI> happy in them&s;elves, <HI>and to qualify them for the di&s;charge of the various duties, which particularly belong to the</HI> FEMALE CHARACTER.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELCOME! my dear Mrs. <HI>Sutton,</HI> to this hou&s;e, once the abode of your beloved friend; by your kind compliance with her dying reque&s;t, that you would &s;upply to her dear children the lo&s;s of a tender parent, you have re&s;tored peace to my long afflicted bo&s;om, and engaged my warme&s;t gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, &s;ir, the &s;incerity of your profe&s;&s;ion; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y frequent re&s;idence in your hou&s;e, during the life of my mo&s;t valued friend, convinced me of your merit, and you were long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my e&s;teem, I there|fore gladly accepted your hand, and will endeavor to imitate, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the character of her, who&s;e memory is as dear to me as to your&s;elf.&mdash;But where are the dear children? I long to fold them to my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! madam, you know not the arduous talk you have undertaken; for &s;ome months before her death, <HI>So|phia</HI> had been obliged to remit her u&s;ual attention to them; &s;he perceived the unhappy effects of her invo|luntary neglect, and her la&s;t hours were embittered
<PB N="8" REF="023336_0006_0FBEFF1902F2A768">
apprehen&s;ions, that the faults she perceived ari&s;ing in their tempers would encrea&s;e for want of proper ma|nagement. Whil&s;t I beheld her langui&s;hing with &s;ick|ne&s;s, I could not my&s;elf attend to their in&s;truction; and the fatal &s;troke which deprived me of her for ever, totally di&s;qualified me for dome&s;tic duties; all I could do, was, to weep over my children. But I now re|&s;olve to bani&s;h unavailing &s;orrow, and be again a fa|ther. I will immediately introduce them to you, and may they improve the happy advantage I have pro|cured them! but I fear your reception will not be very agreeable, as I under&s;tand, &s;ince my return, that my elder daughters are greatly di&s;plea&s;ed at my mar|riage. I thought to give them an agreeable &s;urprize, by bringing you home as their mother, as they were once &s;o affectionately attached to you.</P>

<P>No, Mi&s;s, that you won't. I knew a mother-in-law who half &s;tarved her children, and &s;hut them quite up from company, and made them learn hard ta&s;ks, and would never let them go out.

I left them below, be|cau&s;e I thought we could have no chat if they were by, for they are old enough to tell tales. For my part, I never will live nur&s;ery maid again where there are children who can talk. When the poor little dears are in <HI>arms</HI> there is plea&s;ure in nur&s;ing them; for if a friend, or one's &s;weetheart comes, one can to&s;s them into a cradle, or tie them in a chair, and if they cry, a lump of &s;ugar will pacify them.

<P>Indeed, my dear Mr. <HI>Sutton,</HI> you take up this mat|ter too &s;eriou&s;ly.

Let me ob|tain your permi&s;&s;ion to di&s;charge the nur&s;ery-maids, for I am certain we &s;hall not thoroughly &s;ucceed till they are gone; my own woman will do what is nece&s;|&s;ary for the younger children, till I can hire other &s;ervants; and her ta&s;k will not be difficult, for I pro|po&s;e to keep them as much as po&s;&s;ible under my own eye.</P>

<P>Excellent woman! now do your virtues ri&s;e upon me! Pur&s;ue your own plans, I will cheerfully co-ope|rate with you in them; but find it difficult to re&s;train my anger at &s;uch perver&s;ene&s;s.</P>

<P>I contemplate with great delight their growing vir|tues.

<P>Your ob&s;ervation, Mi&s;s <HI>Tate,</HI> is very natural to eve|ry thinking mind; there is not an object, in my opinion, more de&s;erving pity then young people, born of parents who&s;e &s;ole delight proceeds from gaiety and dre&s;s. The children, it is true, for a few years, are kept from partaking their plea&s;ures, but where &s;uch is the con|duct of the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, &s;ervants catch the infection, and in&s;till gay ideas into the minds of children. even from their cradle. Thus prepared, they long to grow up, merely to be introduced into every &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation and folly, without imagin|ing there is any other end propo&s;ed by their exi&s;tence, and mea&s;ure each other's happine&s;s by the greate&s;t number of times they are allowed to partake in every public entertainment.</P>

<P>It is thus, indeed, madam, they become bad wives and mothers; with &s;uch a foundation is it wonderful, that all the attention of a governe&s;s cannot overcome prejudices &s;o unhappily imbibed, growing as it were with their &s;trength, and interwoven in their natures; We who have the care of &s;o many different young ladies ea&s;ily di&s;cern the advantage of children's having mo|thers who have been attentive to them from their ear|lie&s;t infancy; nor can it be more &s;trongly marked than in the characters we were &s;peaking of.

<P>What a noble example, al&s;o, does Mrs. <HI>Gower</HI> &s;et, who, in the prime of her life, gives up all amu&s;ement but what &s;he can partake with her children, teaching them her&s;elf almo&s;t every branch of their education, and thus converting tho&s;e talents, which were uncom|monly cultivated by her father, to the mo&s;t u&s;eful and plea&s;ing end. She was an only child, and had a very large fortune; but being ble&s;&s;ed with a numerous family, and her hu&s;band's circum&s;tances much reduced during the American war, he has at her de&s;ire laid down his coach, given up his hou&s;e in town, and they now re&s;ide throughout the year in the country.

<P>I rejoice to &s;ee it my dear mi&s;s; reflect always that many have greater &s;orrows than yours' without your comforts; but I mu&s;t now leave you, as it is, I &s;hall not be in time to &s;end in my lady's &s;upper, although &s;he never has it till ten o'clock.. The leaving you as I do with &s;uch worthy friends, relieves my heart from its unea&s;ine&s;s on your account. One affectionate em|brace, my dear, my beloved child! may you be ble&s;t and happy! cheri&s;h your good di&s;po&s;ition, and it will relieve, if it can-not cure your &s;orrows.</P>

<P>I have not rode farther than I do every fine even|ing; but if I had, do you think I &s;hould mind any fatigue that was to be a mean of relieving your anxie|ty, my beloved child?

as I am become their father I am determined, if I can|not alter their mode of thinking, I will never expo&s;e their follies.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>pur&s;uance of the plan laid down in the former part of this little work, I now pre&s;ent my Readers with two additional</HI> Dramatic Pieces; <HI>in which I have endea|voured to &s;hew, that a</HI> life of di&s;&s;ipation is <HI>dreadful in its con&s;equences, as it puts a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">op to</HI> mental improvements, <HI>de&s;troys</HI> dome&s;tic harmony, is <HI>highly</HI> injurious to &s;o|ciety, <HI>and endangers the lo&s;s of</HI> eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>It is impo&s;&s;ible, in the compa&s;s of &s;o &s;hort a work as the pre&s;ent, to place this important matter in its</HI> &s;trongest ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; <HI>neither can advice given in this, or any other mode, be expected to have due weight, unle&s;s enforced by parental</HI> authority <HI>and</HI> example; <HI>a proper exertion of the one, and circum&s;pection in regard to the other, would &s;pare many mothers the &s;orrow of &s;eeing their blooming offspring &s;ink into untimely graves; and the bitter re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">r&s;e that mo&s;t &s;ucceed</HI> [<HI>if any &s;en&s;e of</HI> religion <HI>remains in the mind</HI>] <HI>for neglecting to prepare them for &s;o awful a change.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Full of health and gaiety, young per&s;ons, are apt to imagine their &s;trength equal to every exertion which their love of in&s;atiable plea&s;ure may require. They expo&s;e them&s;elves alternately to the exce&s;&s;es of</HI> heat <HI>and</HI> cold; <HI>they</HI> defy fatigue; <HI>they</HI> abridge <HI>them&s;elves of their</HI> re&s;t, <HI>or they take</HI> repo&s;e <HI>in tho&s;e hours, when the air, cleared from</HI> noxious vapours <HI>by the</HI> morning &s;un, <HI>is full of</HI> invigorating fre&s;hne&s;s; <HI>which would give &s;trength to their bodies, and improve the natural cheerfulne&s;s of their minds; not con&s;idering, that till their</HI> growth is com|pleted, <HI>the utmo&s;t care is requi&s;ite to</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h a good con&s;titution. <HI>For &s;uch imprudent irregularities, the</HI> inexperience <HI>and</HI> impetuo&s;ity <HI>of</HI> youth <HI>may be admitted as an apology; but what can excu&s;e the</HI> mother <HI>who, frequently for</HI> her own gratification, <HI>leads on her</HI> daugh|ters <HI>in &s;o dangerous a career? Many in&s;tances does the pre&s;ent day afford, of per&s;ons, who like Mrs.</HI> Lovele&s;s

encourage, <HI>nay</HI> cheri&s;h <HI>tho&s;e very faults, which it is their duty to</HI> eradicate.</P>
<P><HI>Sorry I am to &s;ay, that &s;uch</HI> reformations <HI>as are ex|hibited in the&s;e</HI> Dramatic Pieces, <HI>are not &s;o much</HI> pic|tures of what really happens in the world, <HI>as</HI> ideal repre&s;entations <HI>of &s;uch as</HI> ought to take place; <HI>yet, I flatter my&s;elf, they will prove acceptable to mothers of another de&s;cription, and u&s;eful to tho&s;e for whom they are particularly de&s;igned; young ladies, who&s;e</HI> &s;chool-education is completed, <HI>and who are arrived at that period of their lives, when the in&s;truction given them, &s;hould have for its immediate object the cultivation of the</HI> Dome&s;tic Virtues, <HI>with a view to their filling, with propriety, the important offices of</HI> WIVES <HI>and</HI> MO|THERS.</P>
<P><HI>Could the</HI> elder daughters of families <HI>be prevailed on to imitate, as far as opportunity admits, the example of the</HI> MATERNAL SISTER. <HI>they would certainly find the benefit of it in their own improvement, the increa&s;e of their parents affections, the attachment and re&s;pectfulne&s;s of their younger brothers and &s;i&s;ters, the e&s;teem of the world, and the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven.</HI></P>

<P>HOW fortunate has my life hitherto been, dear <HI>Maria!</HI> an invariably kind <HI>mother-in-law,</HI> &s;uc|ceeded to the tendere&s;t of <HI>real</HI> ones; and for &s;ome time I have been ble&s;&s;ed with the con&s;tant &s;ociety of my mo&s;t e&s;teemed friend, who&s;e amiable virtues en|dear her to every heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> LOVELESS</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not let your partiality over-rate my worth, <HI>Isabella;</HI> when you con&s;ider what examples I have had before my eyes from my infancy, it is rather won|derful that I am not a <HI>perfect</HI> character, than that I &s;hould endeavour to be an humble copy of their excel|lencies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a&s;toni&s;hes me in your conduct, is, the &s;weet|ne&s;s with which you bear mi&s;fortune and di&s;appoint|ment. I for my part, have no <HI>merit</HI> in being contented and happy, becau&s;e every circum&s;tance has commenced to make me &s;o; but you, on the contrary, have known

<HI>&s;orrow</HI> and <HI>mortification</HI> without complaining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I really po&s;&s;e&s;s the fortitude you kindly attribute to me, my dear friend, I am chiefly indebted for it to my honoured mother, who from the dawn of rea&s;on, &s;tudied to &s;trengthen my mind to bear di&s;appointments; her kind endeavours were &s;econded by the arguments of my worthy governe&s;s; and at length, &s;trongly con|firmed by the conduct and precepts of my good aunt, during the two years I lived with her as her adopted daughter.

<P>And &s;o I ought to be. It is true, I do, and ever &s;hall regret them; no time will wear out the remem|brance of their perfections, or my gratitude for their kindne&s;s to me. But ought I to repine for ble&s;&s;ings pa&s;t, who have not only the tendere&s;t of fathers, but, in Mrs. <HI>Sutton,</HI> one of the kinde&s;t of friends? &s;he has taken me as one of her own family, and never &s;uffers me to feel any other ill effects from the death of my relations, than the lo&s;s of their &s;ociety.</P>

<P>How can I &s;ufficiently thank you, my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Lovele&s;s,</HI> for your kind indulgence to an unhappy crea|ture! I cannot give you now the whole hi&s;tory of my &s;hameful mi&s;conduct, for I expect every minute to be called to Mi&s;s <HI>Blomberg,</HI> I mu&s;t therefore, ha&s;ten to tell you, that after treating my dear father and his amiable wife, with the utmo&s;t ingratitude and di&s;re&s;|pect, in return for their unparalleled kindne&s;s and in|dulgence, I formed a connection with a worthle&s;s man, of low degree, and con&s;ented to a <HI>clande&s;tine mar|riage.</HI>&mdash;An unhappy &s;tep which I have had cau&s;e to repent from the fir&s;t moment I was ra&s;h enough to take it! I exchanged my dear father's hou&s;e for a mean mi&s;erable lodging. And &s;oon as the wretch, I had married, found he was deceived in the information which had been given him, that I could claim my mo|ther's jointure on the day of my marriag, he began to treat me in the cruele&s;t manner; in con&s;equence of &s;uch inhumanity, I was &s;oon &s;eized with a violent ill|ne&s;s, in which he abandoned me, and I have never &s;ince heard of him. I happily recovered through the tender care of my landlady; and finding an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for doing &s;omething for a livelihood, [for I had not courage to return to my father] I reque&s;ted

this good woman to make enquiries for me; and by her recommendation, I now wait upon the Mi&s;s <HI>Blom|bergs.</HI> So far from repining at the mortifications I en|dure, I regard them as the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of my di&s;o|bedience.</P>

<P>I am greatly affected with your narrative. It con|firms me in the opinion I have heard my dear mother often expre&s;s, "that <HI>clande&s;tine marriages</HI> are general|ly unhappy ones."Do not think, that by &s;aying this, I mean to ca&s;t reflections on you, my friend; it would be cruel to do &s;o, as you are &s;en&s;ible of your errors, and are &s;o great a &s;ufferer by them. I would not add to your afflictions, but if I could le&s;&s;en them, it would give me much &s;ati&s;faction. Parhaps, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my good Mrs. <HI>Sutton,</HI> I may be a mean of concil|iating matters between you and your parents, if you will allow me to act as a mediatrix.</P>

<P>Nor is it in <HI>human nature,</HI> my dear, to commit &s;uch enormities, where the <HI>better part</HI> of that nature, <HI>Rea|&s;on,</HI> is &s;uffered to prevail.

In vain does parental authority exert its influence over a mind re&s;olved to re&s;i&s;t it; the ear of the &s;elf-willed is deaf to the kinde&s;t admoni|tions. All that a parent can do, is to recommend the be&s;t path; but if the child will think her knowlege &s;uperior to that of her in&s;tructors, and refu&s;e to obey the advice of experience, &s;he mu&s;t fall, and become mi&s;erable, like poor Mi&s;s <HI>Rawlins.</HI></P>

What a rock have we e&s;caped, my dear mamma, left, as we were, for a time, to our own guidance, or rather to the fatal influence of &s;ervants.

<P>It is very true, my dear. But though I can by no mean acquit Mi&s;s <HI>Rawlins,</HI> yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, that &s;he has an excu&s;e which you could not have pleaded. Her mamma was the very rever&s;e of yours, and lived ju&s;t long enough to &s;trengthen the weeds &s;pringing in her child's mind, which was the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of mater|nal care to eradicate. The unfortunate prejudice, which in common with many other young people, Mi&s;s <HI>Rawlins</HI> took up again&s;t a mother-in-law, prevented her li&s;tening to the admonitions of hers, which increa&s;|ed her &s;tubborne&s;s to &s;uch pitch, that nothing but the mi&s;eries &s;he has endured, could have evercome them.</P>

<P>I hope her con&s;titution will &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock, and do, mo&s;t &s;incerely pity her; but is not her father a &s;till greater object of compa&s;&s;ion, who does not de&s;erve the mi&s;ery of mind which &s;he has brought to him? But you were enquiring, Mrs. <HI>Lovele&s;s,</HI> what means Mr. <HI>Lovele&s;s</HI> and I had been employing in her behalf? you were right in your conjecture, that it was on her ac|count I &s;ummoned him to my hou&s;e, which, on a le&s;s important bu&s;ine&s;s, would, at &s;uch a time, have, been impertinent.

<P>I mu&s;t fir&s;t tell you, that on my return to my lodg|ing, I found Mrs. <HI>Rawlins</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Gower</HI> waiting for me. It &s;eems Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Rawlins</HI> came the day before to &s;pend a week or two with Mr. <HI>Gower</HI> at <HI>Redlands</HI> where he has lately taken a hou&s;e; Mi&s;s <HI>Gower</HI> having vi&s;ited us &s;ince we came to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> mentioned this circum&s;tance to Mrs. <HI>Rawlins,</HI> who re&s;olved to call on me, in hopes that <HI>Maria</HI> might be

able to give her &s;ome information concerning the un|happy fugitive. The letter I &s;ent this morning, of cour&s;e has not yet reached her hands; but by conver&s;ing with Mrs. <HI>Rawlins,</HI> I had an opportunity of &s;aying more in Mrs. <HI>Benfield'</HI>s favour, than a letter could compri&s;e; and I took the liberty of &s;ending for Mr. <HI>Lovele&s;s</HI> as a joint advocate.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. SUTTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>As much, my love, as I could rea&s;onably expect: Mrs. <HI>Rawlins</HI> is all gentlene&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, and would, I am &s;ure, immediately receive her daughter home; but Mr. <HI>Rawlins</HI>'s con&s;ent mu&s;t be obtained fir&s;t; and that &s;he cannot a&s;k at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e his mind has been greatly irritated by the ill behaviour of his &s;on-in-law, who has been in&s;olent enough to go to his hou&s;e and demand his wife, under pretence, that &s;he has eloped from him: not that he wants to live with her, but merely to extort money from her father.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Rawlins</HI> is a very good man, Mi&s;s <HI>Fanny,</HI> and will act as a Chri&s;tian, I make no doubt: but con&s;ider, his feelings mu&s;t have been very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ones, and &s;ome time mu&s;t be allowed to conquer them. Con&s;ider al&s;o, the di&s;grace his daughter has brought upon a re|putable family, and her former di&s;obedient behaviour, and then you cannot wonder if he withholds his for|givene&s;s, at lea&s;t till he is &s;ure that her penitence is &s;incere.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mr</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot comprehend your meaning, <HI>Jemima:</HI> the nur&s;e was well recommended, as I under&s;tood; and the child appeared to be in a very thriving &s;tate when I la&s;t &s;aw her.</P>

<P>She was greatly altered then indeed, &s;ir, when I found her; and I have rea&s;on to think would have peri&s;hed through neglect and bad management, if I had not been fortunate enough to call on her as I did. You know, that nur&s;e's hou&s;e is in the road from my aunt's hither, &s;o affection led me to &s;top as I was com|ing home, in order to &s;ee my little &s;i&s;ter: but what
<PB N="6" REF="023336_0153_0FBEFD803A507B68">
was the &s;urpri&s;e, both of my aunt and me, at finding the cottage door wide open, though expo&s;ed to the cold ea&s;terly wind; the floor of the room wet; &s;everal panes in the ca&s;ements broken; and the dear little ba|by lying in a cradle, as dirty as a beggar, crying in the mo&s;t pitious manner imaginable? I approached the cradle with an agitation of mind not to be de&s;cribed, and took the dear little creature up; at the &s;ame time de&s;iring my aunt's maid, who accompanied us, to &s;earch the hou&s;e for the nur&s;e; but her &s;earch was fruitle&s;s; at la&s;t, in the garden, &s;he found a boy of &s;ix years old, who, it &s;eems had been left by his mother to rock the cradle; but who, tired of his employment, had e&s;caped to play, and left her by her&s;elf.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>On enquiring in the neighbourhood, we learnt, that this inhuman woman, who had undertaken to perform a mother's part made it a daily cu&s;tom to neglect her infant charge, that &s;he might range from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, hearing and relating idle tales, thoughtle&s;s of the dear babe's wants, unmindful of her own obliga|tion: &s;o with my aunt's advice, I re&s;olved to take her home with me.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, <HI>Jemima,</HI> or I &s;hall be ready to ca&s;t reflections on your mother, who, if &s;he was not able to nur&s;e <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> &s;hould at lea&s;t have been more circum|&s;pect in the choice of a &s;ub&s;titute. If &s;he would have done as I at fir&s;t de&s;ired her, and acted a mother's part by <HI>you</HI> her <HI>elde&s;t,</HI> I have rea&s;on to think we &s;hould have been a <HI>united happy family,</HI> for I once loved <HI>little children;</HI> and had <HI>mine</HI> been managed properly, &s;hould have placed my delight in them: but alas! I have known no comfort with them. Whil&s;t at nur&s;e, they were &s;o &s;hy, there was no inviting them to come near one; and when they returned home, they were &s;o
<PB N="7" REF="023336_0154_0FBEFD86150AC7A0">
unmanageable I was glad to have them kept in the nur&s;ery, and from thence &s;ent to &s;chool as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible. But let me &s;ee the little &s;ufferer. I am exceed|ingly affected with the account you have given me of her. I hope &s;he is not in danger of dying?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, &s;ir; my good aunt &s;taid with us till <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t, when &s;he was obliged to go home for a few days; by my following her directions, <HI>Frances</HI> is quite charm|ingly. I left her in a fine &s;leep, and ordered the maid to take her after breakfa&s;t into the park, from whence I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he is not yet returned; when &s;he comes in I will bring her to you. In the mean time, will you permit me to fetch <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Henry?</HI> but before they make their appearance, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I have taken advantage of being here a month before you returned from the We&s;t, and have elected my&s;elf into the office of their governe&s;s, as I thought even <HI>my poor in&s;tru&s;tion</HI> was better then none at all.

<P>We will allow that it was, as you &s;ay, their indi&s;|cen&s;ible duty; but is there no <HI>reciprocal</HI> duty on the <HI>child's part?</HI> Is there no return of affection required or fifteen years comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? Look down

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would endeavour to do &s;o, <HI>Clari&s;&s;a;</HI> for I enter|tain the highe&s;t idea of <HI>filial duty,</HI> and cannot conceive what plea&s;ure there can be in di&s;covering a parent's faults. To me it appears a great crime to ferutinize their characters, unle&s;s with a view of di&s;covering their virtues, in order to copy them. All human be|ings are liable to error, and why &s;hould we expect our parents in particular to be exempt from them? For my part, I am firmly of opinion, that no children can delight in pointing out defects in a father or mother's conduct, who are not con&s;cious of improprieties in their own, which they hope to excu&s;e to the world, by throwing the blame on their parents. Pardon me, <HI>Clari&s;&s;a;</HI> but if you were a little older I &s;hould really &s;u&s;pect from the complaints you have exhibited again&s;t yours, thet you were going to throw off their author|ity by a <HI>clande&s;tine marriage.</HI></P>

<P>You can &s;carcely figure to your&s;elf a more di&s;tracted place than this hou&s;e was when we came home to pa&s;s the la&s;tholidays. Whenever it was po&s;&s;ible for mamma to bear the fatigue of dre&s;&s;ing &s;he went out, but &s;el|dom took us with her, becau&s;e my papa objected to the expence attending our being introduced into the world; and not only to that, but really &s;eemed to grudge mo|ney for hou&s;ekeeping. This produced dreadful alter|cations between them. Papa would &s;ometimes be in &s;uch violent pa&s;&s;ions that you would have been frigh|tened to &s;ee him, and generally left the hou&s;e for the whole day afterwards; and then mamma would &s;it and fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;uch a degree, that there was no &s;uch thing as being comfortable with her.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! <HI>Clari&s;&s;a!</HI> how can you a&s;k that que&s;tion? Is filial affection extingui&s;hed in your heart? I hope not! rather let me &s;uppo&s;e, that the indifference with which you &s;peak of altercations that di&s;tre&s;s me even to hear of, ari&s;es from want of reflection. Depend on it, my dear, there mu&s;t have been &s;ome very material cau&s;e for &s;uch a change in papa's temper, which is natural|ly a very good one. A cau&s;e, which, from what I ju&s;t now told you of his circum&s;tances, you can no lon|ger be at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s. But go on with your &s;tory.</P>

<P>She had; and what I am going to tell you will un|fold them to you.

Among Mrs. <HI>Carter's</HI> vi&s;itors was a young man of very &s;mart appearance, who &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, was really a young gentleman, who had, like us, bad parents.

<P>I was, my dear, the &s;econd &s;on of my father, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, as you know, a con&s;iderable e&s;tate; but as I had an elder brother and four &s;i&s;ters, my expectations of for|tune were moderate, and my father intended me for the bar. With a view to my advancement in life, he placed me with an eminent batri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er.

<PB N="47" REF="023336_0193_0FBEFDDD529971B0">
and being entirely at a lo&s;s how to provide for our future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of throwing our|&s;elves at the feet of our parents.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Greater than you can imagine, my dear. Their ju&s;t reproaches were like daggers to our hearts. My wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e's father, being a man of the nice&s;t honor was at fir&s;t inexo|rable, for he &s;eared the world would &s;u&s;pect him of being privy to the match; and mine treated me with a coolne&s;s which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having de&s;erved it rend|ered doubly afflicting; however, he kindly continued the &s;um he had allotted for my annual allowance, with &s;ome addition; and then my father-in-law was induced to give my wife a &s;mall portion. We took a little house in town: and had we under&s;tood dome&s;tic oeconomy, might have lived very comfortably; but in&s;tead of re|doubling my a&s;&s;iduities at the law, I entirely neglected my &s;tudies; and your mother having no judgment in re&s;pect to the expenditure of money, was liable to numberle&s;s impositions; this, added to a ta&s;te for public diver&s;ions, which we fooli&s;hly &s;ub&s;tituted for dome&s;tic plea&s;ures, in|volved us in a variety of difficulties, [<HI>Mi&s;s</HI> Clari&s;&s;a <HI>bur&s;ts into tears.</HI> My dear <HI>Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> why are you &s;o greatly af|fected?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed my good &s;ir, my feelings are very great as well as <HI>Clari&s;&s;a's.</HI> The idea of what our parents mu&s;t have &s;uf|fered is enough to awaken the tendere&s;t emotion.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear girls, I will ha&s;ten to a conclu&s;ion of my &s;tory. To add to our embarra&s;&s;ment a young family came on. I wi&s;hed your mother to nur&s;e you her&s;elf, <HI>Jemima;</HI> but &s;ome of her fa&s;hionable acquaintance per|&s;uaded

her, that it would ruin her health, and confine her con&s;tantly at home, &s;o &s;he was prevailed on to put you to nur&s;e. And thus was one of the greate&s;t delights in life, that of <HI>enjoying our children in their infancy,</HI> turned out of doors; for every &s;ucceeding child was, like you, con&s;igned to the care of a &s;tranger; two we buried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, &s;ir, but that, notwith&s;tanding we were put to nur&s;e, both you and my dear mother had a great deal of care and trouble, as well as expence on our account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>We had indeed, my dear. After we had been married &s;even years, my elder brother died of a fever, and I be|came my father's heir; he lived but &s;ix months after his &s;on, and, with his dying breath, urged me to leave the idle cour&s;e of life I was in, and pa&s;s my time like a <HI>chri&s;|tian.</HI> I fully intended to obey him; but both your mo|ther and I found it difficult to &s;hake off our old compan|ions, who enticed us on from day to day, till having mo|ney at command, we became more di&s;&s;ipated than ever; fortunately, neither of us had any ta&s;te for gaming, or we might have totally ruined our family. The events of this day have recalled to my mind my father's dying injunc|tions, which I am re&s;olved, though late to fultil.&mdash;O! my dear, my honored parent! how does my heart reproach me for ingratitude to your memory!</P>

<P>My dear &s;ir, you afflict your&s;elf beyond mea&s;ure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CLEVELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> my remor&s;e, though great, is not equal to my offences. <HI>Obedience to parents</HI> is one of the fir&s;t of moral duties; no one can violate it without offending their <HI>heavenly Father,</HI> who&s;e repre&s;entatives our <HI>earthly parents</HI> are to us. Nay, di&s;obedience naturally leads to the breach of other duties. Had I been a good &s;on, and followed my father's early advice, which was to <HI>&s;ettle my principles, e&s;tabli&s;h a good character,</HI> and <HI>have a pro&s;pect of providing for a family before I thought of marrying,</HI> I

<P>Henceforth you &s;hall find me all a parent &s;hould be; but I lo&s;e the thread of my narration.

However, the prudent plan you have propo&s;ed, my dear <HI>Jemima,</HI> will I think, in a few years bring my affairs round, and I hope to live in &s;uch a manner as to give my chil|dren cau&s;e to ble&s;s me.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="023336_0198_0FBEFB0753B7E5B8">
<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>Dramatic Pieces,</HI> which con&s;titute the pre&s;ent volume, I have endeavoured to point out the <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>odiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of <HI>pride,</HI> the <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>amiable|ne&s;s</HI> of <HI>humility,</HI> and the advantages which may be deri|ved from the different acquirements of a liberal education, in <HI>a &s;tate of adver&s;ity.</HI> In the &s;econd, an attempt is made to exhibit a &s;triking <HI>contra&s;t</HI> between the manners of a daughter, brought up under the tuition of a &s;en&s;ible and tender mother, and tho&s;e of a poor young creature, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been vani&s;hed by a mi&s;taken parent to a foreign land, where &s;he wa&s;ted &s;ome of her mo&s;t valuable years in the acqui&s;ition of <HI>vanity, conceit</HI> and <HI>pertne&s;s,</HI> under the idea of <HI>politene&s;s</HI> and <HI>refinement.</HI></P>
<P>It is really wonderful to think, how parents can thus bring them&s;elves to &s;end their children from under the eye of tenderne&s;s, and watchful &s;olicitude? At <HI>nine</HI> or <HI>ten</HI> years of age, many girls are &s;eparated from every relation or friend, who would kindly correct their growing errors, and are placed as boarders in <HI>convents.</HI> It is the intere&s;t of the Superiors to &s;end the mo&s;t flattering accounts of the di&s;po&s;itions and improvements of tho&s;e committed to their care. The mother is naturally precluded from any knowledge of the real <HI>truth,</HI> neither can &s;he a&s;certain the treatment which her child meets with, who is &s;ubimitted to the <HI>chance</HI> of becoming the object of <HI>ill-natured &s;everi|ty,</HI> without an affectionate friend to &s;oothe her affliction, or redre&s;s her grievances. But the&s;e are trifling con&s;ide|rations, in compari&s;on with a &s;till greater danger to which children, &s;ent for education to a <HI>catholic country,</HI> are ex|po&s;ed. That of imbibing the principles of an <HI>erroneous</HI> and <HI>&s;uper&s;titious religion;</HI> one great <HI>tenet</HI> of which is <HI>the merit of making converts.</HI> How then can it be expected, that the zealous profe&s;&s;ors of it, with forbear employing their endeavours to bias tho&s;e tender minds which are
<PB N="3" REF="023336_0199_0FBEFB08B05F8F68">
thus expo&s;ed to their delu&s;ions? but allowing that the per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the children of <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are <HI>true to their tru&s;t:</HI> what better can be expected, than that their <HI>pupils</HI> return home without <HI>any religion at all?</HI></P>
<P>Having in this volume brought my work to a conclu|&s;ion, I mu&s;t entreat my Readers to con&s;ider it, as parti|cularly intended for <HI>young ladies ju&s;t entering into the world,</HI> who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be preparing them&s;elves for tho&s;e relations in life, which it is natural for them to look forward to. For <HI>their</HI> benefit only, have I been induced to bring forth to view, the <HI>faults of parents.</HI> I hope it will appear, from the execution of my plan, that nothing is farther from my de&s;ign than the exciting in young fe|male minds, <HI>premature thoughts</HI> of <HI>love</HI> and <HI>marriage;</HI> though I do not agree in opinion with many parents, who would on no account conver&s;e on tho&s;e &s;ubjects with their daughters, till they are ju&s;t entering the marriage &s;tate. Under proper regulations they ought frequently to be referred to, &s;o far, I mean, as is nece&s;&s;ary to point out the errors which prove fatal to the happine&s;s of numbers, that young ladies may know, before they engage in the mo&s;t important connections of life, the danger of <HI>impro|per conduct;</HI> and be qualified when they have an oppor|tunity of marrying with a good pro&s;pect, and the full con|&s;ent of their friends, to make a "well ordered home, their hu&s;bands be&s;t delight."To in&s;truct their children, govern their &s;ervants, and regulate their expences; in|&s;tead of fancying, as is too frequently the ca&s;e with the <HI>modern fair,</HI> that when they leave &s;chool they have no|thing to do but to <HI>di&s;play</HI> their <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>accompli&s;hments,</HI> to <HI>adorn their per&s;ons,</HI> in order to gain admiration, and <HI>to run the giddy round of ince&s;&s;ant amu&s;ement.</HI> Wretch|ed mu&s;t be the man who calls &s;uch an one his <HI>wi&s;e!</HI> mi&s;|erable the lot of her <HI>neglected children<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI></P>

<P>I am at pre&s;ent very bu&s;y in making the children's things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is an employment in which you will never re|ceive any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me; I &s;hould not have thought of troubling my&s;elf about a parcel of tire&s;ome bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were once a little brat, as you call it, your&s;elf; what would have become of you if every body had been of your opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, but I was the elde&s;t, and a rarity&mdash;and had people

now to wait upon me? and &s;o ought my brothers and &s;i&s;ters to have&mdash;for mamma cannot rea&s;onably expect that I &s;hould throw my time away upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, how do we in all companies hear Mi&s;s <HI>True-worth</HI> prai&s;ed; becau&s;e &s;he takes &s;o much pains with her brothers and &s;i&s;ters, and teaches them every thing they learn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may do very well for her, who has no great for|tune to boa&s;t of&mdash;but my papa, though he is a <HI>trade&s;man,</HI> has money enough for a <HI>lord;</HI> and my aunt told me, he could make us as rich as <HI>ladies.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be &s;o, but mamma teaches a different le&s;&s;on; &s;he &s;ays, we had better be <HI>good</HI> than <HI>great,</HI> and that <HI>hu|mility</HI> is a mo&s;t amiable virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know the rea&s;on of that? becau&s;e &s;he her&s;elf had no fortune, but was a pennyle&s;s colonel's daughter, and, therefore, as my aunt told me, &s;he de&s;pi&s;es money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;ure mamma is the mo&s;t agreeable woman I ever &s;aw. She is &s;o gentle and kind to every one, I think it very &s;trange that my aunt &s;hould have &s;poken again&s;t her, and to her own child too!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ee much harm in what my aunt &s;aid. When my papa con&s;ented to my living with her, &s;he endeavour|ed to eradicate many &s;entiments which differed from her own; It was natural for her to try to per&s;uade me to think like her&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o. But I know your going to live with her was contrary to mamma's inclination, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have of|ten &s;een her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am only &s;orry my poor aunt died, which obliged me
<PB N="5" REF="023336_0203_0FBEFB1638386520">
to return home, for I &s;hall never be &s;o happy again as I was with her. Mamma confines me and will not let me have a variety of fine cloaths. I was forced to get at papa alone, and coax him to con&s;ent to our going to Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Fierville'</HI>s ball, and to allow us new dre&s;&s;es for the occa&s;ion; and I can perceive that mamma is di&s;|plea&s;ed becau&s;e I have gained my point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie! <HI>Matilda,</HI> you accu&s;e my dear mother very wrongfully; indeed &s;he is delighted to give us plea&s;ure under proper re&s;trictions; and &s;urely &s;he mu&s;t be a bet|ter judge of propriety than either you or I can pretend to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps &s;o; but her notions are very &s;trange. The other day &s;he chid me for not giving Mrs. <HI>Molly,</HI> the hou&s;emaid an an&s;wer. Why, I cannot think there is any nece&s;&s;ity for &s;hewing civility to &s;uch &s;ort of people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of treating them otherwi&s;e than civilly. Whil&s;t they do their duty, they have a right to our regard; and the be&s;t method of in&s;uring re&s;|pect from them, is &s;etting a good example, which can|not be done without feeling both for them and our&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I always treated my aunt's &s;ervants ju&s;t as I plea&s;ed, and they were forced to &s;ubmit to it: &s;om times I made them play with me, and at other times, u&s;ed them as ill as ever I could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould be a&s;hamed, even if mamma permitted it, to act &s;o by any body inferior to me; if they are <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> they are as good as I am, and much more <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>So are the cat and the dog, I con&s;ider them all on a footing.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do not I: but you have no <HI>&s;pirit.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, the other afternoon, you would have &s;ubmitted to Mi&s;s <HI>Foley</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itting above us; yet I &s;oon &s;ent the lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o her proper &s;tation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To confe&s;s the truth, I never was &s;o much confu&s;ed in my life as at your conduct on that occa&s;ion; for I am &s;ure, <HI>Harriet Foley</HI> would not for the world, be guilty of rudene&s;s to any one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What bu&s;ine&s;s had &s;he to &s;et her&s;elf <HI>above me?</HI> I &s;hall always act &s;o by every body I think beneath me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mamma &s;ets us a very different example; and yet &s;he is every where treated with great re&s;pect.</P>

<P>To be &s;ure does not <HI>money make the man;</HI> and has not mamma an elegant coach, a great hou&s;e and riches enough to outdo mo&s;t of her neighbours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But &s;he does not plume her&s;elf upon the&s;e advantages. You know, <HI>"the humble &s;hall be exalted."</HI></P>

<P>And <HI>"the exalted may be aba&s;ed for me."</HI> I &s;hall never think of &s;uch precepts while I am <HI>rich, poor</HI> I cannot be; for I know my aunt left me hand&s;omely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard &s;o much about <HI>rickes</HI> before; my mam|ma has always armed my mind to bear a <HI>rever&s;e</HI> of for|tune, and I think papa mu&s;t have had great lo&s;&s;es lately, or he would not have di&s;charged &s;everal &s;ervants, and given up his hou&s;e in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be horrid indeed, if he reduces his circum&s;tan|ces;
<PB N="7" REF="023336_0205_0FBEFB196CF59520">
though it will not trouble me, for he mu&s;t always &s;upport me as I have been u&s;ed to live; I cannot &s;ubmit to a <HI>rever&s;e.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be a great &s;hame if we murmured at any em|ployment which my mamma &s;ets us the example of. To &s;ave her trouble, I offered to make the&s;e frocks, as the maid, who u&s;ed to work for the children, is one of tho&s;e who are di&s;charged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>One comfort is, I do not know how either to make or mend, and I am not ambitious of learning, believe me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never &s;aw my mamma at &s;uch employment till very lately, yet &s;he does it with as much cheerfulne&s;s as em|broidery, or any other fancy work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the truth, <HI>I hate work,</HI> nor <HI>will</HI> I do any. My aunt never made me, and why &s;hould any other per|&s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I cannot bear <HI>idlene&s;s.</HI> My mamma's example has taught me to love employment, and I am by that means, free from the danger of having my time ever hang heavi|ly on my hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have found time &s;adly heavy &s;ince my return home, but never did &s;o at my aunt's; for there I u&s;ed, when tired of the <HI>parlour,</HI> to go into the <HI>kitchen,</HI> or <HI>garden,</HI> and make the &s;ervants romp with me; but now it is in vain to &s;peak to a dome&s;tic, for they have orders not to hold conver&s;ation, or be more with me than their bu&s;ine&s;s re|quires, on pain of lo&s;ing their places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wa&s;ted time in pa&s;&s;ing it &s;o unprofitably; the attention to my education, mamma's conver&s;ation, and playing with the little ones, fills up all my hours without leaving a moment to &s;pare. Apropos, have you &s;een the

<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope &s;o. She will at lea&s;t treat them with kindne&s;s; even &s;ervants may behave &s;o as to de&s;erve thanks. If <HI>Matilda</HI> acts properly, the advantage will be her <HI>own;</HI> for, giving encouragement where it is due, &s;ecure her re&s;|pect. But in this in&s;tance, the heart mu&s;t be ill formed that could lead any one to forget the mi&s;fortunes which reduced poor Mrs. <HI>Gates</HI> to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation: yet, while we pity her di&s;tre&s;s we mu&s;t honor the fortitude that has &s;et her above it, and made her prefer gaining her bread by virtuous indu&s;try, to becoming the flatterer of empty pride with a view of gaining a livelihood among the great.</P>

<P>At lea&s;t you are to blame, for de&s;pi&s;ing, and treating with hautine&s;s, a worthy amiable woman, only becau&s;e &s;he makes your gowns. A woman who was better <HI>born</HI> and as <HI>well educated</HI> as your&s;elf.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meanne&s;s is not a nece&s;&s;ary attendant on poverty. Your aunt is dead, and her faults ought to be buried in oblivion. Truly am I concerned, that through the nar|rowne&s;s of her mind, &s;he has &s;o greatly contracted your's: yet, I hope, precept and ob&s;ervation, will overcome the prejudices of education.&mdash;Would your father's becoming poor make me le&s;s a gentlewoman?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you <HI>doubt.</HI> Let me, therefore, endeavour to convince your <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> by relating two examples of people per&s;onality known to you. To begin with Mrs. <HI>Gates,</HI> her hu&s;band was a gentleman of fortune but unhappily fond of <HI>&s;hew</HI> and <HI>parade;</HI> he lived to &s;quander away his whole e&s;tate, among people who only de&s;pi&s;ed, though they a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed to ruin him; as his death &s;he was left de&s;titute with three
<PB N="15" REF="023336_0213_0FBEFB2FC62F5020">
young children. All her acquaintance of high rank for|&s;ook her; &s;ome few friends remained, but they were &s;uch as you would call <HI>mean,</HI> becau&s;e they were not <HI>rich.</HI> The&s;e &s;olicited relief for her, from her hu&s;band's former inti|mates. They all turned a deaf ear, except one great lady, who offered to give her the run of her hou&s;e, that is to <HI>feed her;</HI> in return for which, &s;he was to <HI>flatter</HI> her <HI>ab&s;ur|dities,</HI> and even her <HI>vices.</HI> Her children were to be put out to &s;ervice as they grew up. Mrs. <HI>Gates</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed the <HI>offer</HI> and the <HI>offerer;</HI> and with the advice and recommen|dation of her more humble friends, &s;he undertook her pre&s;ent employment, in which &s;he has happily &s;ucceeded, and is regarded, and re&s;pected by the <HI>good,</HI> whether of <HI>high</HI> or <HI>low</HI> degree. Mrs. <HI>Combs,</HI> who you know lives with Lady <HI>Harris,</HI> was reduced al&s;o by the extravagance of others; yet rather than undertake any thing like <HI>work,</HI> &s;he &s;ubmitted to become her lady&s;hip's <HI>humble friend.</HI> You have often remarked the cruel treatment &s;he receives even before us, who vi&s;it Lady <HI>Harris,</HI> merely on a foot|ing of formality. Now tell me, <HI>Matilda,</HI> which of the&s;e two per&s;ons is the mo&s;t <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> character and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the <HI>propere&s;t pride?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you relate it, Mrs. <HI>Gates</HI> is undoubtedly the be&s;t, and the happie&s;t. But if my <HI>papa</HI> were to lo&s;e his fortune, I do not know what would become of <HI>me,</HI> for I am cer|tain I could not follow her example.</P>

<P>It cannot be plea&s;ing to you young as you are, to dwell upon &s;uch a thought. Yet [<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ghs</HI>] it is a mi&s;fortune very likely to happen. Your papa carries on an exten&s;ive trade, and his &s;ucce&s;s depends more frequently on others, or even on the uncertain elements, than on him&s;elf. It is therefore the duty of all connected with him to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m their minds for a rever&s;e; and I would wi&s;h you to con|&s;ider things in a proper light, that you may be &s;trengthened to &s;upport a mi&s;fortune, which it will probably be your portion to bear.</P>

<P>I begin to honor and love my dear mother, as much as you do. Her mildne&s;s has convinced my rea&s;on; had &s;he exerted any violence, I am certain &s;he would have found me ob&s;tinate, though I mu&s;t confe&s;s greatly again&s;t my own intere&s;t.</P>

<P>You are right, I am convinced; that thought never &s;truck me before, but I did not give my&s;elf time to con|&s;ider much about any thing; however, I &s;hall become a new being. But do you think, <HI>Clara,</HI> mamma will ever love me as well as &s;he does you?</P>

<P>I have no room to believe &s;he makes any difference among any of us, in re&s;pect to her <HI>affection,</HI> though I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e your being guided by her better judgment, will procure you a larger portion of her e&s;teem than you at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>

<P>You are very polite young ladies, with &s;uch a di&s;po&s;i|tion your &s;ociety will be de&s;irable to people of all ages. But there is time for all things.

<P>I was plea&s;ed with the &s;olemnity of their wor&s;hip; and &s;till I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my dear mamma, that I rather feel a bias towards a religion which, notwith&s;tanding the promi&s;es that were made to you to the contrary, tho&s;e who had the care of my education took &s;o much pains to inculcate; and had it not been for the urgent de&s;ire I felt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o return to <HI>England,</HI> I certainly &s;hould have profe&s;|&s;ed my&s;elf a Roman Catholic; but I knew I &s;hould by thi&s; mean cut my&s;elf off from my family and deare&s;t con|nections, therefore, re&s;olved to re&s;i&s;t all importunities; and the levity of conduct which I a&s;&s;umed, (though high|ly blameable) was thus far &s;erviceable to me, that it &s;elt me little time to attend to any &s;erious &s;ubject; for, except during the time of divine &s;ervice, and whil&s;t I was re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">iving grave lectures, I &s;eldom thought on religion at all.</P>

<P>Do not, my dear daughter, afflict your&s;elf too much for an error, which, I tru&s;t, is not irreparable.
