<P>_AT a time, when the unju&s;t &s;torm of mi|ni&s;terial wrath, is di&s;charging it&s;elf in a cruel and ignominous manner, on the noble, patriotic, brave people of the ancient, loyal important colony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, in New-England;&mdash;at a time when all the other colonies in North-Ame|rica, like the true children of <HI>a free-born family,</HI> are rou&s;ed to &s;ome ju&s;t re&s;entment of &s;uch in|&s;ults, on their natural and legal rights, taking each other as by the hand, and uniting by the invincible chains of love, friend&s;hip, and inte|re&s;t, are determined to &s;upport this their elder &s;i&s;ter colony, now &s;uffering &s;o gloriou&s;ly in the common cau&s;e, or <HI>&s;ink</HI> together.&mdash;At a time, when the alarm is &s;ounding from ea&s;t to we&s;t, over this va&s;t continent of North-America, to arms!&mdash;to arms!&mdash;in &s;hort, at a time when the minds of <HI>all</HI> are in &s;uch a ferment, that they can be &s;carce com|po&s;ed to hear any &s;ubject, but what may have &s;ome reference to the pre&s;ent times; it is but rea&s;ona|ble to &s;uppo&s;e, that even the Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Prince
<PB N="6" REF="013861_0005_0F9254889EC073A8">
of peace,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s for ordinary is, neither <HI>war</HI> or <HI>politicks,</HI> in &s;uch a &s;ituation, being mem|ber of civil &s;ociety, and intere&s;ted like other men, would improve the times, by adopting their public in&s;tructions, to the be&s;t &s;ervice of the people, and not offen&s;ive or di&s;plea&s;ing to God; who&s;e holy word is a ble&s;&s;ed directory in every emergency.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o but rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that every judicious, &s;ober American, being now reduced to the dreadful alternative, either to take up arms, apparently again&s;t that very government, which he was wont to revere, and under which he ex|pected protection for both life and property; or &s;ubmit tamely to the galling yoke of <HI>perpetual &s;lavery;</HI> I &s;ay, it is &s;uppo&s;able, that every &s;uch Chri&s;tian American &s;oldier will be all ear to whole&s;ome in&s;tructions, relative to his pre&s;ent duty.</P>
<P>We own it is rare for &s;oldiers to a&s;k coun&s;el of go&s;pel Mini&s;ters; and the more pity&mdash;for they are men and &s;inners, as well as others; but I am not called to addre&s;s <HI>Red-Coats,</HI> but CHRISTIAN <HI>Provincials;</HI> yet ble&s;&s;ed be God, it is not a ca&s;e wholly unprecedented, for even regulars to apply to a go&s;pel Preacher for direction; we have an in&s;tance in the words of our text.&mdash;<HI>And the &s;oldiers demanded of him, &s;aying, And what &s;hall we do? and he &s;aid unto them, Do violence to no man, neither ac|cu&s;e any fal&s;ly, and be content with your wages</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>We here find a very important que&s;tion propo|&s;ed to a per&s;on, every way qualified to &s;olve it; for the mouth of truth it&s;elf tells us, that of all who were then born of woman, there was not a greater prophet than John the Bapti&s;t: Al&s;o, the angel who predicted his birth, &s;aid, that he &s;hould be fil|led with the Holy Gho&s;t, from his mother's womb. He was therefore de&s;ervedly very popular&mdash;was
<PB N="7" REF="013861_0006_0F92548939B5C208">
rai&s;ed for the great purpo&s;e of introducing the Jewi&s;h church, to the Saviour of the world; and hence much true go&s;pel light &s;hone round this great Preacher.&mdash;The an&s;wers he gave the que&s;ti|on, may be depended on to be &s;ufficient and con|clu&s;ive.</P>
<P>But let us hear, what does John &s;ay? Does he tell them, to lay down their arms, and throw them by, as there can be no &s;ort of war lawful? as &s;ome would have us believe!&mdash;No, no, this is not his an&s;wer; John knew better;&mdash;he knew the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our depraved world would render war in many ca&s;es unavoidable, and even nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;So that a &s;oldier might &s;erve the end of his being in his place and calling, as well as a plowman or preacher in theirs.</P>
<P>But then it mu&s;t be a ju&s;t war, conducted in a lawful, righteous manner; for the legality of the action, will never ju&s;tify the illegality of the manner of pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier mu&s;t do violence to no man&mdash;mu&s;t not accu&s;e any fal&s;ly&mdash;and mu&s;t be content with his wages; leading vices the&s;e, for ordinary, among <HI>regular</HI> troops; but the CHRISTIAN <HI>&s;oldier</HI> mu&s;t guard again&s;t them, from the genuine prin|ciples of true religion, in the heart; and then may hope for heaven, as well from a field of bat|tle, as expiring on his couch in the mid&s;t of peace and tranquility.</P>
<P>I now deduce this doctrine from the text, thus explained&mdash;Doctrine.</P>
<P>That although war is in it&s;elf a very great evil, and one of tho&s;e &s;ore judgments, by which a holy God puni&s;hes the world for &s;in, therefore to be deprecated, and avoided as much as po&s;&s;i|ble; yet is at times, by rea&s;on of certain cir|circum&s;tances, &s;o unavoidable, that it is our duty to enter into it.&mdash;The method I de&s;ign to
<PB N="8" REF="013861_0007_0F925489F9353BB0">
pur&s;ue, in opening up the doctrine, for improv|ment, is the following:&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Humbly attempt to &s;hew (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to better judgment) when a war is &s;o unavoidable and nece&s;&s;ary, that it is our duty to enter into it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Shew how we &s;hould enter into, and pro&s;ecute even a ju&s;t war.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Improve the &s;ubject, by the deduction of a few natural inferences from the whole.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>You are &s;en&s;ible, my hearers, that there are &s;ome Chri&s;tian people in the world, and &s;ome of them in the&s;e parts, who merit the regard of the public, by their general character of indu&s;try, inoffen&s;ivene&s;s, and &s;obriety; yet do maintain it, as a &s;acred con&s;cientious tenet, not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, <HI>not to go to war, or take up arms on any occa&s;ion what&s;oever</HI>; and charity, the leading grace of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, will lead us to deal tenderly with &s;uch, as far as we have grounds to believe they are &s;incere in their profe&s;&s;ion: We ought to pity &s;uch for their mi&s;take, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to convince them; but not by any means to urge them again&s;t their avowed &s;entiments, le&s;t we come under the odious appellation of <HI>per&s;ecutors.</HI></P>
<P>As far as the&s;e &s;ober people make u&s;e of the Bible, to found their principles on, they rely on &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e, Gen. ix.6. <HI>He that &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed</HI>; and Exod. xx.13. <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill</HI>; and in the New Te&s;ta|ment, <HI>But I &s;ay unto you, love your enemies;&mdash;if any &s;mite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other al|&s;o;&mdash;for all they that take the &s;word &s;hall peri&s;h by the &s;word:</HI> Matth. v. 39, 44. and xxvi. 52. and hence conclude, though I think fal&s;ly, that all war is unlawful, except the &s;piritual, with our own cor|ruptions, by the &s;word of the &s;pirit, in Chri&s;t's
<PB N="9" REF="013861_0008_0F92548ABAFF2258">
&s;piritual kingdom, which is not of this world, el&s;e would his children fight.</P>
<P>But if I mi&s;take not, the&s;e people regard only &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of holy &s;cripture, as &s;eem to favour their favourite opinion, let the language of other pa&s;&s;ages be what they will;&mdash;and hence their own imagination is &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of divine reve|lation, &s;o that when people are determined to keep by a &s;entiment, be it right or wrong, there is an end of all di&s;putation.&mdash;</P>
<P>We readily allow, that it would be happy for us all, if there was no moral or natural evil in the world: But how plau&s;ible &s;oever &s;uch opini|ons may appear, to the weal of &s;ociety, they are rather calculated to the condition of innocent, than depraved nature; which now is, and ever has been &s;uch, &s;ince the fall of our fir&s;t parents, that there is need of &s;ome remedy to curb its evil tendencies, or mankind would &s;carce be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the world; and this our indulgent, righteous Creator knows; and has therefore &s;et up civil government to keep man from de&s;troy|ing each other: But civil government has no power, if it has not the &s;word, to be a terror to evil doers,&mdash;and a prai&s;e to them that do well.&mdash;Hence it will follow, that men are under a nece&s;&s;ity to part with &s;ome of their na|tural rights, to &s;ecure the re&s;t;&mdash;they mu&s;t give part of their earnings to &s;uch as are cho&s;en by them&s;elves, to rule the whole;&mdash;and then again, they mu&s;t help the rulers to execute the good and whol&s;ome laws of government, again&s;t their vio|lators. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, a great banditti ri&s;e to re&s;cue murderers; if the&s;e are not quelled, government is overthrown, if the people do not a&s;&s;i&s;t good government, and here then ari&s;es a nece&s;&s;ity to go to war.</P>
<P>And &s;uppo&s;e again, on the other hand, which
<PB N="10" REF="013861_0009_0F92548B7984CAE0">
is very &s;uppo&s;able, That the rulers of the people &s;hould give way to the many temptations their high &s;tations will lead them to; to indulge evil, the inclinations of a lu&s;t for ab&s;olute dominion, independent of the people, &s;o that all the barrier of oaths and covenants are broke through, to effect the plan; and the people have no &s;ecurity, for either life or property, but the mere &s;ove|reign plea&s;ure of the ab&s;olute rulers;&mdash;then the people are under a di&s;agreeable, but pre&s;&s;ing ne|nece&s;&s;ity, rather than be cru&s;hed by an iron rod, to re-a&s;certain their own ju&s;t rights; and &s;tand forth all of them to oppo&s;e &s;uch tyranny:&mdash;Here then is another in&s;tance of &s;elf-defence&mdash;in which a war is both unavoidable and nece&s;&s;ary, and therefore lawful, if &s;elf-pre&s;ervation is lawful; which is the point I &s;hall next, in order, endea|vour to prove indi&s;putably, both from the light of nature, and divine revelation; and fir&s;t from the light of nature.</P>
<P>It is certainly evident, wherever we turn our eyes, on any part of the whole creation of God, that the principle of &s;elf-love or &s;elf-pre&s;ervation or the de&s;ire of exi&s;tence, is deeply engraved on the nature of every creature. And when this great fir&s;t principle is ob&s;erved, it is, and mu&s;t be agreeable to God, as he will love his own work; and &s;o al&s;o, the neglect of the exerci&s;e of this principle, can not but di&s;plea&s;e him, as it is un|natural and mon&s;trous. Thus the generous vine will extend her arms, to lay hold on the fir&s;t neighbouring prop; and with her little tender tendants, twine around it, to pre&s;erve her clu&s;t|ers from peri&s;hing on the cold ground.</P>
<P>The little indu&s;trious bee, is furni&s;hed by her Creator, with a &s;ting to pre&s;erve for her own u&s;e, to her&s;elf, her &s;weet honey, the fruit of her toil and indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="013861_0010_0F92548C4D866ED0">The ox has his horns; and the hor&s;e his teeth and hoofs.&mdash;The deer her feet for flight, and the fowls their wings to e&s;cape danger, and pre&s;erve them&s;elves. And &s;hall man, the noble&s;t creature in the lower world, be de&s;titute of this nece&s;&s;ary principle! which we &s;ee engraved by in&s;tinct on the irrational creation? Man is ble&s;t with rea&s;on to direct his enquiries, in &s;earch of happine&s;s. His maker God allows him to &s;eek, to be as happy as he po&s;&s;ibly can, both in this life and the life to come. But &s;ince man is a fallen, &s;inful creature, he has lo&s;t his true road to happine&s;s&mdash;and can never find it, until his maker points it out to him in the Holy Bible. Here we are taught how to conduct both in the civil and religious life: We are certain the &s;criptures allow us to defend our|&s;elves in the be&s;t manner we can again&s;t an enemy.</P>
<P>Therefore, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, as would &s;eem to &s;peak a different language; &s;uch as tho&s;e already quoted, mu&s;t be under&s;tood, in a con&s;i&s;tency with this great law of nature; as well as con&s;i&s;t|ent with other parts of &s;cripture. For Chri&s;t came not to make void, or de&s;troy the law, but to fulfil&mdash;when therefore we are forbid to &s;hed blood, or to kill; it is innocent blood is meant&mdash; but this doth not forbid to execute a murderer. The divine law requires, that a murderer &s;hould be executed, and forbids to take a ran&s;om for his life.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, when a body of wicked people join to|gether, or a nation unite, to call upon and de|&s;troy without any ju&s;t cau&s;e an innocent people. The in&s;ulted, or invaded people, are then to unite together, to oppo&s;e, expel and puni&s;h the guilty invaders&mdash;as in Judges v. 23. <HI>Cur&s;e ye Meroz (&s;aid the Angel of the Lord,) cur&s;e ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof: Becau&s;e they can not to the help of the Lord, again&s;t the mighty:</HI> And Jeremiah
<PB N="12" REF="013861_0011_0F92548D007D88B8">
xlviii.10. <HI>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully; and cur&s;ed be he that keepeth back his &s;word from blood:</HI> And in Luke xxii. 36. Je&s;us Chri&s;t told his Di&s;ciples to arm them&s;elves again&s;t approachng danger.&mdash;<HI>And he that hath no &s;word let him &s;elf his garment and buy one.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ince our Lord did not allow the Di&s;ciples then to defend them&s;elves by their weapons, for when Peter cut off Malcus's ear he immediately healed it, and bid Peter to put up his &s;word, to let them know, and the enemy al&s;o know, that he was Lord of life and death&mdash;and that the Di&s;ciples were &s;afe with &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us, while the age of miracles continued; I &s;ay, &s;ince this was the ca&s;e then, we mu&s;t under&s;tand the pa&s;&s;age to intend, that it is both lawful and a duty, for the followers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in a time and age, when we are not to expect miracles, to arm our&s;elves and u&s;e our arms for our own pre|&s;ervation again&s;t any invading enemy.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e follow, that where our ble&s;&s;ed Lord enjoins us, when &s;mote on the one cheek, to turn the other al&s;o, he does not mean to forbid us to u&s;e lawful and proper means of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. But the meaning mu&s;t be as the phra&s;e is proverbial, that we &s;hould at no time di&s;cover a revengeful or unforgiving di&s;po&s;ition; but &s;hould be ready to put up with a good deal of ill-u&s;age, before we would create di&s;turbance,&mdash; yea that we &s;hould do any thing con&s;i&s;tent with our own &s;afety. Again, where our Lord enjoins us to love our enemies&mdash;he can't po&s;&s;ibly mean that we &s;hould love them better than our&s;elves&mdash; that we &s;hould put it in the enemy's power to kill us, when we had it in our power to &s;ave our own life, by killing the enemy. I &s;ay, this cannot be the meaning; for that expo&s;ition will thwart the original fir&s;t great law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. The
<PB N="13" REF="013861_0012_0F925492A6E029E8">
meaning therefore mu&s;t be, that we do not che|ri&s;h a &s;pirit of hatred towards the enemies, and would be willing to be reconciled again&mdash;and would be de&s;irous, the enemy would be convinced of his evil &s;entiment again&s;t us, that we might be again on friendly terms,&mdash;that we can be &s;in|cere in our prayer to God, to bring &s;uch a de&s;ir|able event to pa&s;s. Again,</P>
<P>That a &s;elf-defen&s;ive war is lawful, I will prove from the conduct of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf. If civil government is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and war is nece&s;&s;ary, at times, in government, as has been already proved; then it will follow, that tho&s;e who &s;upport civil government, do &s;upport war, and &s;o of con&s;equence approve of war. But Je&s;us Chri&s;t did pay his tribute money, to the Emperor Tiberius, Matthew xvii, 27, and tho&s;e who are acquainted with the life of Tiberius Cae|&s;ar, know that he had frequent wars. Our Lord did here, as in &s;everal other places, draw a line of di&s;tinction between church and &s;tate; the church was his own kingdom, and &s;piritual in its nature and government, and was not of this world; but the &s;tate was a di&s;tinct con&s;titution, was of this world, was purely civil, and it was not e&s;&s;ential to the being of an Emperor, of what &s;ort of religion he was of, or whether of any, as was the ca&s;e of Tiberius; but as the Jews were tributaries to the Romans, and our Lord was a Jew by birth; he paid his tax as a peaceable member of the commonwealth; but had our Lord been a Menoni&s;t he would have refu&s;ed to pay tribute, to &s;upport war, which &s;hews the ab&s;ur|dity of the&s;e people's conduct.</P>
<P>Had our Lord been a Covenanter of the church of Scotland, he would refu&s;e to pay tribute, be|cau&s;e the Emperor was not a Covenanter.&mdash;I own, it is not e&s;&s;ential to the very being of a King
<PB N="14" REF="013861_0013_0F9254949D85F008">
to be a Chri&s;tian, yet it is e&s;&s;ential to the being of a good man, to be a Chri&s;tian; and certainly the more pious and truly godly any Chri&s;tian ru|ler is, if he is not a bigot to a party, or certain de|nomination, but equally regardful of all, the re|gular, &s;ober, and well behaving, in all his domi|nions&mdash;the happier for the people.&mdash;In Rom. 13, from the beginning, to the 7th ver&s;e, we are in|&s;tructed at large the duty we owe to civil-govern|ment, but if it was unlawful and anti-Chri&s;tian, or anti-&s;criptural to &s;upport war, it would be un|lawful to pay taxes; if it is unlawful to go to war, it is unlawful to pay another to do it, or to go to do it: What a fooli&s;h trick tho&s;e people put on their con&s;ciences, who for the rea&s;ons al|ready mentioned will not pay their taxes, and yet let others come and take their money, where they can find it, and be &s;ure they will leave it where they can find it handily.</P>
<P>I think I have now proved, from the light of nature, from the rea&s;on of things&mdash;from the Old and New-Te&s;tament as well as from the example of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, that a &s;elf-defen&s;ive war is lawful.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e who deny this doctrine ought, if they would be ingenious, candid and hone&s;t, to place their argument on this footing: Suppo&s;e them&s;elves capable of being by them&s;elves, all on &s;ome part of our Globe, and none el&s;e but them&s;elves; and &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, none el&s;e ever to come to them, and without any connection with any people, but them&s;elves, they had all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life; in &s;uch a &s;ituation, if they car|ry with them the common nature of the human &s;pecies, as it has di&s;covered it&s;elf in the world in every age, &s;ince the fall of Adam; the&s;e good, peaceable, inoffen&s;ive people, would &s;oon find e|vil di&s;po&s;itions and practices break out even among

them&s;elves, if they would then make no re&s;i&s;t|ance at all, to tho&s;e evils, but on their avowed principles, when &s;mote on the one cheek, turn the other; there would &s;oon be an end of their &s;ociety&mdash;the evil would &s;oon de&s;troy the peacea|ble and good out of the world; then the judge|ments of the Almighty would undoubtedly over|take and cut off the wicked, when there would be none el&s;e in the world; and then there would be an end to the being of mankind on the earth. Now this was the re&s;ult of things in the Antede|luvian age, when there was no civil government at all in the world, the wicked de&s;troyed the righteous, till there was none left but Noah;&mdash; the Almighty &s;aved him by a miracle, and cut off the re&s;t entirely from the globe.&mdash;And though Noah was as good a man as any of tho&s;e people with whom I am now di&s;puting, his po&s;terity de|generated, and the world needed government to keep it in being to this day. It is al&s;o equally unfair, to &s;ay, <HI>Let us &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee the &s;alvati|on of God;</HI> for if this proves any thing, it proves too much, it proves that we are to u&s;e no means at all, for why to u&s;e lawful means in our power one time, and not another? we mu&s;t therefore neither plow or &s;ow; build, rai&s;e &s;tock, or do any any thing in the u&s;e of means, <HI>but &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee the &s;alvation of God:</HI> But our rea&s;on is given us to u&s;e it in a proper manner, to pre&s;erve our own lives and the lives of others, as God's &s;ervants, in a &s;tate of probation in this world; and God will reward every one finally according to his works; when we have no means in our power, we honor God to tru&s;t him, as I&s;rael at the Red-Sea, and in the wilderne&s;s;&mdash;but when means are in our power, and we do not u&s;e them, we then tempt God, and rebel again&s;t his govern|ment,

<P>I now proceed to the &s;econd thing propo&s;ed, in this di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;hew how a lawful war is to be carried on.</P>
<P N="1">I. Every one that draws the &s;word, &s;hould be well &s;atisfied, in his con&s;cience, that he is called of God to do &s;o;&mdash;that, with a good con&s;cience and courage, he may rely on God for &s;trength and and protection.&mdash;Then it is drawn for the&s;e rea|&s;ons, or el&s;e it cannot be lawful; either to op|po&s;e a foreign enemy&mdash;or to a&s;&s;i&s;t the magi&s;trates to &s;uppre&s;s a riot, or wicked &s;action and rebel|lion that may have broke out, by a lawle&s;s &s;et of ruffians, that will be under no re&s;traint of law

<P N="2">2d. Every &s;oldier &s;hould &s;ee to it above all things, that his peace is made with God, by be|lieving in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t for &s;alvation; and have &s;ome comfortable evidences of the truth of his faith, by his love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in keeping his commandments;&mdash;el&s;e how can he expect a ble&s;&s;ing, or &s;ucce&s;s, even in a ju&s;t cau&s;e, if he is him&s;elf in a &s;tate of enmity and rebellion again&s;t that God, in who&s;e hand his life is, and who&s;e are all his ways? For no &s;oldier is &s;o undaunted and truly couragious, as him that on the princi|ples of true religion, is above the fear of death.</P>
<P>To ru&s;h forward on death, thoughtle&s;s of, and unprepared for, a future eternity, is rather a &s;pecies of mere madne&s;s, than true heroi&s;m.</P>

<P N="4">4thly. The &s;oldier mu&s;t ob&s;erve &s;trictly tho&s;e di|rections in our text: <HI>He mu&s;t do violence to no man;</HI> as &s;oldiers carry with them the in&s;truments of death, they are too prone to conduct them&s;elves towards the defencele&s;s with pride and in&s;olence; &s;omething of this temper di&s;covered it&s;elf, at the time that the&s;e <HI>Regulars</HI> a&s;ked John in the man|ner of their a&s;king the que&s;tion;&mdash;others treated John with re&s;pect and manners;&mdash;the very Pub|licans called him Ma&s;ter;&mdash;but the <HI>Red-Coats</HI> came and <HI>demanded of him,</HI> as if they were his &s;uperi|ors,

<P>But ble&s;&s;ed be the God of heaven, that the gentlemen who now form our militia, in Ameri|ca, are the Americans them&s;elves, who&s;e cha|racters are known to be not &s;uch as but ju&s;t now de&s;cribed; and who we hope, under God, will &s;ave this country, and of con&s;equence the Briti&s;h empire from apparent ruin.</P>

occa&s;ion the very mi&s;eries, they were rai&s;ed to avert. A few inferences &s;hall now conclude this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Our &s;ubject teaches us deeply to bewail the univer&s;al depravity of human nature;&mdash;O Adam! in what a deplorable condition is thy family now!&mdash;what ha&s;t thou done!&mdash;how many evil pa&s;&s;ions and appetites rage in the world!&mdash;Envy, wrath, malice, di&s;&s;imulation, covetou&s;ne&s;s, pride, brutal lu&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> whence ari&s;e tho&s;e cru&s;hing woes and calamities of wars, murder, rapine, &s;laughter and de&s;olations among mankind. How ju&s;t it is for a holy God, as the moral Governor of the world, to puni&s;h &s;uch &s;inful guilty crea|tures.</P>
<P N="2">2. We learn hence the exceeding innate evil of &s;in, if the puni&s;hment is not inadequate to the offence, which we are not to &s;uppo&s;e; then the offence is very great, becau&s;e of the great pu|ni&s;hment inflicted.</P>
<P N="3">3. We al&s;o learn from our &s;ubject, to admire the care of divine providence over the human race, to continue men on the earth amid&s;t &s;uch deluges of mi&s;eries or de&s;truction on every hand. And as civil government, in the hand of divine providence, is &s;ub&s;ervient here too, we ought to ble&s;s God for the in&s;titution, and &s;upport it while government continues to ob&s;erve its original de|&s;ign <HI>viz.</HI> the protection of the lives and properties of the people.</P>
<P N="4">4. We may al&s;o acknowledge the goodne&s;s of God, in abridging the life of man, to 70 years, for that is long enough for the wicked to rage, and the righteous to &s;uffer&mdash;and be ab&s;ent from that re&s;t that God has prepared for his people. How amazing that the Church of Chri&s;t has not been &s;wallowed up, by the united combinations of all the evil&mdash;&s;pirits of darkne&s;s, and the
<PB N="20" REF="013861_0019_0F92549A12D332D8">
wicked in this world in every age! this is the mighty power of God indeed!</P>
<P N="5">5. We learn from this &s;ubject, the &s;pecial need our world &s;tands in of a SAVIOUR, that by the grace of his holy covenant, according to the great rich divine plan he has revealed in the holy Bible, &s;uch &s;inful creatures as we are, may be &s;anctified and pardoned, and made fit for u&s;efulne&s;s in this life, and the enjoyment of God in heaven.</P>
<P N="6">6. Our &s;ubject teaches us to be reconciled to the thoughts of death, on the true principles of go&s;|pel holine&s;s, whenever it &s;hall plea&s;e God to call us hence; as all in this &s;inning, tea&s;ing mortify|ing di&s;appointing world, as Solomon ju&s;tly ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <HI>vanity and vexation of &s;pirit;</HI> and yet on the other hand, we mu&s;t not repine at the hand of God, if we are continued long even in a &s;tate of affliction;&mdash;but &s;hould &s;ay with that old Te&s;ta|ment-&s;aint, <HI>all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come:</HI>&mdash;It is our great wi&s;dom and intere&s;t, to take heed, that we have not with Dives our good things here, but would make the be&s;t of this pre&s;ent life, as a wilderne&s;s pa&s;&s;age, through which we would journey to the better country, the heavenly.</P>
<P N="7">7. We hence learn how much it is our duty to be both frequent, and very fervent in prayer to God, for the &s;piritual kingdom of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ts &s;o much in peace and love, to come with divine power and ener|gy, to check and &s;top tho&s;e evils that now rage in the world, as it is well known, by long expe|rience, that it is the holy &s;pirit accompanying a preached go&s;pel, that is the only &s;overeign reme|dy, to cure the evils that are in the hearts of men, to qualify them to be real ble&s;&s;ings to each other, as members of &s;ociety in this life, and to
<PB N="21" REF="013861_0020_0F92549AB0A47038">
put them in a capacity for communion with the holy Trinity and &s;aints and angels in heaven.</P>
<P N="8">8thly And la&s;tly, Our &s;ubject teaches us, how much we &s;hould deprecate the calamities of war &mdash;e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a civil war; the mo&s;t awful of any, if it could be avoided. And O what an awful dark cloud, pregnant with all the horrors of civil war, hangs now over this whole conti|nent of Briti&s;h America; and this terrifying thought leads me to clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e in two addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. To all my hearers in general&mdash;you are, in this town, now at ea&s;e, in the lap of peace and plenty; far from any &s;cene of either blood or &s;laughter&mdash;in the heart of a rich province, &s;itu|ated in the center of the whole American Conti|nent&mdash;you hear of di&s;tre&s;s, but you do not yet feel it; and God forbid you ever &s;hould, as &s;ome of your worthy brethren now do in Bo&s;ton. But know, my dear hearers, that if you abu&s;e the&s;e rich, temporal good things (with which the God of heaven has di&s;tingui&s;hed you) in luxury, pro|fanene&s;s, Sabbath-breaking, &s;wearing, unclean|ne&s;s, drunkenne&s;s, worldline&s;s, pride and con|tempt of the &s;acred and divine in&s;tructions of his holy word and ordinances. Your &s;ins will find you out, and God will vi&s;it you with his cha&s;ti&s;ing rod for your iniquities. Let all then be exhorted by a &s;incere, unfeigned repentance, for pa&s;t &s;ins and reformation of life and manners, to fly to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by faith, as a hiding place from the &s;torm, and a covert from the tempe&s;t&mdash;be much in prayer to God, to over-rule the&s;e unhappy di&s;turbances for his own glory, and the be&s;t weal of Zion&mdash;pray that they may be brought to a &s;peedy and happy i&s;&s;ue on the genuine principles of liberty and true religion&mdash; pray that the ju&s;t attempts of all America, for
<PB N="22" REF="013861_0021_0F92549F6B9AE338">
the&s;e great ends, may prove &s;ucce&s;sful&mdash;guard again&s;t every thing that has the lea&s;t or remote&s;t tendency, to jar the ble&s;&s;ed uni&s;on of the whole American harp&s;icord, as now &s;et to the tune of liberty, by the honourable great arti&s;ts the CON|TINENTAL CONGRESS&mdash;Let every denomination of Chri&s;tians treat each other with love and re&s;pect, as brethren engaged in, and &s;trugling for the one and &s;ame common cau&s;e&mdash;treat all the officers of civil government in this province with becom|ing honor and re&s;pect&mdash;&s;ympathize with your di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;uffering brethren in Bo&s;ton, both with your prayers and pur&s;es. Finally, dread nothing that can befall you, &s;o ruinous to your&s;elves and po&s;terity in this life, as <HI>&s;lavery.</HI> Therefore u&s;e every lawful means to avert it; &s;ee then that you mo&s;t heartily accord with whatever may be the final determination of all America agreed to in the CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.</P>
<P>I now turn my&s;elf to the Gentlemen of the <HI>Militia,</HI> Officers and Soldiers that appear before me in Church in their UNIFORM.</P>
<P>By your pre&s;ent appearance you declare to the world, that you are nobly willing to ri&s;k your lives and fortunes to &s;ave your country from <HI>&s;lavery</HI>; you are accompanied with the &s;incere wi&s;hes of all good people, for God Almighty to ble&s;s you, protect and &s;ucceed you in your brave undertakings.</P>
<P>Your own improved under&s;tandings will lead you to apply the &s;everal in&s;tructions &s;ugge&s;ted in this Sermon, relative to your duty as warriors; &s;hould we be all &s;o unhappy, as that you &s;hould be ever called to action on account of the pre&s;ent &s;truggles for liberty. In the mean time allow me to require of you, to do your utmo&s;t to pre&s;erve and maintain the good order and peace of this
<PB N="23" REF="013861_0022_0F9254A0E46A0968">
province inviolate; for it is certain, that nothing next to <HI>&s;lavery</HI> is more to be dreaded, than the anarchy and confu&s;ion that will en&s;ue, if proper regard is not paid to the good and whole&s;ome laws of government. And &s;hould we be &s;ubject|ed to &s;uch evils, we will, and mu&s;t blame our Militia&mdash;for no men have it &s;o much in their pow|er to keep the peace and good order of &s;ociety as the gentlemen of the &s;word.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t &s;till continue to revere royalty, and ob&s;erve your allegiance to the King, on the true principles of the con&s;titution. Your drawing the &s;word now mu&s;t not be again&s;t the per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty; but the mal-admini&s;tration of his government, by de&s;igning, mi&s;chief-making mi|ni&s;ters. Your pre&s;ent appearances mu&s;t then be not of choice, but of nece&s;&s;ity. While his Ma|je&s;ty George the third will ob&s;erve his own coro|nation oath, and the principles of the revolution, for the &s;upport of which again&s;t all Jacobite facti|ons, and Tory plots of popery, his ance&s;tors of the illu&s;trious line of Brun&s;wick were placed on the throne of Great-Britain, do you ob&s;erve your allegiance.</P>
<P>I am happy, that I can with a good con&s;cience, congratulate you and my&s;elf this day, on the cer|tainty we have, for the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of our cau&s;e: The angry tools of power who mi&s;lead government, may call us American
<Q>rebels, who would throw off all government,&mdash;would be in|dependent and what not.</Q>
&mdash;But we can now, with great confidence, appeal to God that that is fal&s;e&mdash;we de&s;ire no &s;uch things&mdash;we de&s;ire to be as we were in the beginning of the pre&s;ent unhap|py reign&mdash;we have tried every lawful, peaceable mean in our power&mdash;but all in vain!&mdash;we would love them if they would &s;uffer us&mdash;we would be peaceable, obedient, loving &s;ubjects if they would
<PB N="24" REF="013861_0023_0F9254A139D9B910">
let us; but it would &s;eem as if the pre&s;ent mi|ni&s;try were determined to cram di&s;loyalty, and di&s;obedience down our throats&mdash;and then call us all rebels&mdash;then confi&s;cate our country and &s;ell it, to pay their 140,000,000 of debt, or el&s;e we know not what they would be at. We do in America all declare our&s;elves the &s;ubjects of King George the third, but we never &s;wore allegi|ance to the Parliament of Great-Britain&mdash;or el&s;e we would have above 500 Kings&mdash;they are our fellow &s;ubjects, cho&s;en by the freeholders of that i&s;land to legi&s;late for them, as our A&s;&s;embly doth for Penn&s;ylvania; but if their pre&s;ent claims are admitted, we may give up our A&s;&s;emblies&mdash;and our Charters are cyphers!&mdash;</P>
<P>In the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war, the King had not in all his dominions &s;o many more affectionate &s;ubjects than the Americans&mdash;and by their indu&s;try and trade with England, the nation ro&s;e to her pre&s;ent eminence; and now the very power they helped to give her is retorted on them with re|doubled vengeance and unheard of cruelty&mdash;but if they beat down our trading Cities and oppre&s;s us all they can, we will have our woods and li|berty, for as we are the de&s;cendants of Britons, <HI>we &s;corn to be &s;laves.</HI>&mdash;We are now come to our <HI>ne plus ultra</HI>&mdash;the &s;word, the la&s;t argument mu&s;t decide the controver&s;y. Therefore, you can, GENTLEMEN SOLDIERS, appeal to GOD, for the ju&s;tice of your cau&s;e, he is the judge of all the earth, and will do right, the final determination of all matters is in his righteous, holy, power|ful hand. When England went to war with France and Spain in the time of la&s;t reign, they invoked the aids of the God of heaven by fa&s;t|ing and prayer&mdash;and then government di&s;covered no leanings to popery&mdash;But now, when they are going to murder and butcher their own children

in America, that have been &s;o obedient, u&s;eful and affectionate&mdash;we do not hear that they a&s;k coun&s;el of God&mdash;but if they do not, let us a&s;k coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the God of heaven&mdash; he is on our &s;ide we hope, and if God is on our &s;ide we need not fear what man can do unto us.</P>
