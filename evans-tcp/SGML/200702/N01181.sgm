<P>THE <HI>Greate&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Noblest</HI> Work, that ever is done among the Chil|dren of Men, is this Day to be done in this A&s;&s;embly. The very <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven, fly to the <HI>Win|dows</HI> of Heaven, that they may be the <HI>Glad Spectators</HI> of Such a WORK done among the Children of Men upon Earth. It is, <HI>To E|rect a</HI> TEMPLE <HI>of God.</HI> And what? An <HI>American Wilderne&s;s</HI> be the Place, where the Glorious LORD &s;hall See <HI>Temples</HI> Erected for Him! O Sovereign GRACE! O Won|derful
<PB N="2" REF="001408_0003_0FB2FB231E22EB88">
GRACE! <HI>It is even &s;o, Lord, becau&s;e it Plea&s;es thee</HI>!</P>
<P>Indeed, the Whole CHURCH of GOD, collectively taken, is a TEMPLE, which our <HI>Magnificent Solomon</HI> is Building for Him. The <HI>Building</HI> is not yet Fini&s;hed. The Pe|riod which an&s;wers to the <HI>Seventh Year,</HI> wherein the <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Solomon</HI> was fini&s;hed, is not yet arrived. When it is arrived, the <HI>Acclamations</HI> [and <HI>Solomons</HI> too among the re&s;t!] will be &s;uch as no Age ever yet heard: they will be <HI>A&s;toni&s;hments,</HI> beyond all that were ever yet &s;een in the World. In the mean time, we are told; <HI>All the Building fitly framed together, groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Temple</HI> is <HI>Growing,</HI> in the Con|ver&s;ion of Sinners unto GOD; and the <HI>Ad|dition to the Church daily of tho&s;e that &s;hall be Saved.</HI> When a Sinner is Converted, a New <HI>Stone</HI> is brought and laid in the <HI>Building</HI> of the <HI>Temple.</HI> The <HI>Temple</HI> grows bigger and higher, as often as any Sinner is Converted. God fetches in <HI>Matter</HI> for His <HI>Church,</HI> from all Corners of the World. He will go on doing &s;o, till all the <HI>Elect</HI> are <HI>Effectually Called.</HI> The <HI>Top-&s;tone</HI> of the Church will not be laid, until the La&s;t of the <HI>Elect</HI> be called home to God, that ever &s;hall be &s;o. What a <HI>Shout</HI> will be given upon that Stroke, <HI>It is Fini&s;hed! It is Fini&s;hed</HI>! Until this be done, this is the Rea&s;on why we are &s;o earne&s;t with our Hearers, to Repent of <HI>Sin,</HI> and Return to

<HI>God,</HI> and Believe on <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Lay Hold on Eternal Life.</HI> The Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are <HI>Workmen</HI> about the <HI>Temple.</HI> Their only <HI>Work</HI> in the World &s;hould be, to build the <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. For this we are in conti|nual Agony. Oh&punc; That this Con&s;ideration might prevail with our Hearers, to become <HI>Seriou&s;ly Religious.</HI>
<Q><HI>Children</HI>; At the Mo|ment that you do indeed Re&s;olve to become <HI>Seriou&s;ly Religious,</HI> the <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD, re|ceives a de&s;ireable <HI>Growth</HI> by your Acce&s;&s;ion unto it. You will contribute unto the <HI>Growth</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> in the Day that you turn unto God. Oh! Happy Souls, that are <HI>Stones</HI> in the <HI>Temple</HI> of the Lord! Oh! Glorious Happine&s;s, to be a <HI>Part</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>Temple</HI>! GOD will own you for <HI>His,</HI> in the <HI>Day when He makes up His Jewels.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But there is another Ob&s;ervation, unto which we are now to be invited. As the <HI>&V;niver&s;al Church</HI> is the <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD, So E|very <HI>Particular Church</HI> is to be a <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>There were <HI>Three</HI> Things of High Ac|count, among the Ancient People of GOD; The <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>; The <HI>Family</HI> of <HI>David</HI>; And, the <HI>Temple</HI> of the LORD. In the CHURCH of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, there is a bright <HI>Constellation</HI> of all tho&s;e Glories meeting together. That CHURCH, which is the Body of them, that <HI>Love the Lord, and Hate Evil,</HI> and hope for Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in the Heavenly World. Our
<PB N="4" REF="001408_0005_0FB2FB27A8487830">
Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, That this <HI>Church,</HI> is, The <HI>City of God</HI>; and&punc; The <HI>Family of God</HI>; and, The <HI>Temple of God.</HI> And, Oh! who would not give him&s;elf up unto the Conduct of a Glorious CHRIST, that he may be brought into a <HI>Church</HI> of &s;o great a Character!</P>
<P>Now, the Apo&s;tle having &s;aid, That the <HI>&V;niver&s;al Church</HI> is the <HI>Temple</HI> of God, pre|&s;ently &s;ayes to the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us; You al&s;o are builded together.</HI> The <HI>Particular Church</HI> of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI>; the <HI>Congregational Church,</HI> was al&s;o a <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>I may then, without any Ob&s;truction in the way, pa&s;s on to this <HI>Doctrine and Admoni|tion of the Lord.</HI></P>
<Q>Every Particular <HI>CHURCH</HI> of the Lord <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> is to be together Built in the Glo|rious <HI>LORD,</HI> as a <HI>TEMPLE</HI> of <HI>GOD.</HI></Q>
<P>A <HI>Particular Church,</HI> is, A Society of Chri&s;tians&punc; combining for the Wor&s;hip of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, in the ways that He has In&s;tituted. Or, as our <HI>Catechi&s;ed Children</HI> can tell us; 'Tis <HI>a Congregation of Saints joyned together in the Bond of the Covenant, to Wor&s;hip the Lord, and Edify One another, in all His Holy Ordinances.</HI> I make no Scruple, to call it, <HI>A Congregational Church.</HI> For it is un|que&s;tionable, That a <HI>Congregational Church</HI> is an <HI>In&s;tituted Church.</HI> If a <HI>Church</HI> of another
<PB N="5" REF="001408_0006_0FB2FB2927CA7E30">
Form, &s;hould pretend unto In&s;titution, &s;till 'tis the <HI>Congregational Church,</HI> that has the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> claim, and a <HI>Plain</HI> claim it has, unto it. The <HI>Churches</HI> mention'd in the New Te&s;tament, were every One of them, evidently <HI>Congrega|tional.</HI> And the mo&s;t Judicious, Laborious and Impartial Searches into Chri&s;tian Anti|quity, do declare, That they can't find any other <HI>Churches,</HI> in the Fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tia|nity, but what were <HI>Congregational.</HI> This Truth will mo&s;t certainly gain, as Ignorance, and Prejudice, and Pa&s;&s;ion, in the Treating of &s;uch matters, does abate in the World. Concerning &s;uch a <HI>Particular Church,</HI> we are now to receive divers <HI>Propo&s;itions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Unto what may a CHURCH of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, be likened? Unto what, &s;o well as unto an <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> unto which our Lord JESUS CHRIST Him&s;elf has likened it. You &s;hall find this compari&s;on a&s;&s;erted; 1. Tim. 3.15. <HI>The Hou&s;e of God, which is the Church of the Living God.</HI> In ma|ny Articles <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Compari&s;on be carried on; we will with <HI>Delight</HI> and <HI>Profit,</HI> Reflect upon &s;everal of them.</P>
<P>Has not an <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Builder</HI>? A <HI>Church</HI> has One. And 'tis the Lord Him&s;elf, that is the <HI>Builder</HI> of it. We read, Heb. 3.4. <HI>Every Hou&s;e is built by Some Man; but he that built all things</HI> (here) <HI>is God.</HI></P>
<P>Has not an <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> an <HI>Owner</HI>? A <HI>Church</HI> has
<PB N="6" REF="001408_0007_0FB2FB2AA2A98130">
One. And it is the Lord JESUS CHRIST Him&s;elf that is the <HI>Owner</HI> of it. We read, Heb 3 6 <HI>Chri&s;t is a Son over His own Hou&s;e, who&s;e Hou&s;e we are.</HI></P>
<P>Is there not <HI>Skill</HI> required unto the Buil|ding of an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI>? An <HI>Architect</HI> &s;hould be an <HI>Arti&s;t.</HI> It is no little <HI>Skill,</HI> that is requi&s;ite unto the producing of a <HI>Church,</HI> the Ordering of it, and the Managing of it. It calls for the greate&s;t <HI>Skill</HI> in the World. We read, 1 Cor. 3.10&punc; <HI>A Wi&s;e Master-builder,</HI> mu&s;t be con|cerned.</P>
<P>Does an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> con&s;i&s;t of <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Choice Materials</HI>? A <HI>Church</HI> mu&s;t not con&s;i&s;t of what is <HI>Rotten</HI>; But of <HI>Saints,</HI> that are Styled <HI>Cedars</HI>; and, <HI>Comparable to find Gold.</HI> Nothing but what is <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Choice,</HI> is to be Admitted here; Except we would make a <HI>Vile Cottage</HI> of it. We read, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.1. They mu&s;t be, <HI>Saints, and Faithful in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Mu&s;t the <HI>Materials</HI> of an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> be well <HI>Prepared,</HI> that they may be laid into it? They that are laid in the <HI>Church,</HI> mu&s;t be fetch'd out of the <HI>Rude Heap</HI> of Mankind&punc; and form'd and hew'd and Squar'd and <HI>Shap'd</HI> for a <HI>Place</HI> among <HI>them that are Sanctified.</HI> A Work of <HI>Effectual Calling,</HI> and <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and <HI>Sancti|fication,</HI> is to pa&s;s upon them, to prepare them for it. We read, 1. Pet. 2.5. <HI>As lively Stones,</HI> (not &s;uch <HI>Lifele&s;s</HI> Things, as the <HI>Temple</HI> of old, was compo&s;ed of,) <HI>ye are built up, a Spiritual Hou&s;e; an Holy Prie&s;t-hood.</HI> [Probably <HI>Peter</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001408_0008_0FB2FB31AD5CAFA8">
now had in his Eye the words, which our Saviour had formerly Spoken unto him, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16 18.]</P>
<P>Mu&s;t the <HI>Materials</HI> of an <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> be well <HI>Joyned</HI> unto One another? It will never be an <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> if they be not &s;o. The <HI>Form</HI> of it, ari&s;es from the <HI>Conjunction</HI> of the <HI>Materials.</HI> In the <HI>Church</HI> there is a <HI>Conjunction</HI> of tho&s;e, of whom it is made up. Their <HI>Conjunction</HI> is by a <HI>Covenant</HI> of God. In &s;ome &s;ort or other, they do Re&s;olve and Engage together to Serve the Lord. We read; P&s;al. 122 3. <HI>It is compact together.</HI></P>
<P>What is the <HI>End</HI> of an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI>? 'Tis to <HI>Dwell</HI> in; 'Tis a <HI>Dwelling-place.</HI> A <HI>Church</HI> is the Lords <HI>Dwelling-place.</HI> 'Tis an <HI>Habitation of God.</HI> We read, Rev 2 1&punc; <HI>He walks there.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; In an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> there are various <HI>Ve&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>&V;tin&s;els</HI> And in a <HI>Church</HI> there are &s;o too. We read, 2 Tim 2 20. <HI>In a great Hou&s;e, there are not only Ve&s;&s;els of Gold and of Silver, but al&s;o of Wood&punc; and of Earth; and &s;ome to Honour, &s;ome to Di&s;honour.</HI> Godly and Sincere Per&s;ons in a <HI>Church,</HI> the&s;e are <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Honour&punc; Golden Ve&s;&s;els</HI>&punc; or, The <HI>Plate</HI> of the Hou&s;e. Wicked Per&s;ons, and the men of <HI>this World,</HI> are <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Earth.</HI> Such as <HI>Di&s;ho|nour</HI> God by Sin are <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Di&s;honour</HI> God Save us from coming under &s;uch a Denomi|nation&punc;</P>
<P>But, if a <HI>Church</HI> be an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI>&punc; I Suppo&s;e it will put us in mind. That <HI>Church Work</HI> is
<PB N="8" REF="001408_0009_0FB2FB32E73CAD80">
<HI>Building-Work.</HI> I do not wonder then, that <HI>Church-Work</HI> does go on with <HI>Difficulty</HI>; Or, that it goes on with <HI>Deliberation</HI>; Or, that it is <HI>Expen&s;ive</HI> to carry it on. To <HI>Build</HI> &s;uch an <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> mu&s;t needs be an <HI>Hard</HI> Work, a <HI>Slow</HI> Work, and a <HI>Co&s;tly</HI> One.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> But what kind of an <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> is a <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST? It is an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> that may be called, A <HI>Temple.</HI> Do but &s;ay, Who's <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> it is, and you pre&s;ently deter|mine it, <HI>A Temple.</HI> It is an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD. Hence we read; 2 Cor. 6 16. <HI>Ye are the Tem|ple of the Living GOD.</HI></P>
<P>In affirming a <HI>Church</HI> to be a TEMPLE, there are Two very Important Things af|firm'd concerning a <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t&punc; It is to be Remembred, That a <HI>Church,</HI> is like a <HI>Temple, <HI>Dedicated</HI></HI> and <HI>Con|&s;ecrated</HI> unto the <HI>Special Service</HI> of GOD. What is a <HI>Temple</HI>? 'Tis an <HI>Hou&s;e Dedicated</HI> unto the Wor&s;hip of GOD. What is a CHURCH? 'Tis a Company of Men, who have <HI>Dedicated them&s;elves</HI> unto the Wor&s;hip of GOD. GOD &amp; the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is Wor&s;hipped in the <HI>Church.</HI> The very <HI>De|&s;ign</HI> upon which a <HI>Church</HI> is Erected, is, That the Lord might be Wor&s;hipped there. A CHURCH is, as we read, 1 Cor. 1 2. <HI>To call upon the Name of JES&V;S CHRIST&punc; our Lord.</HI> The Lord JESUS CHRIST affords unto men in His Church, peculiar Opportu|nities
<PB N="9" REF="001408_0010_0FB2FB34790CC838">
of Communion with Him&s;elf. A <HI>Church</HI> is gathered upon this Intention; That Men may therein Enjoy a <HI>Special Com|munion</HI> with GOD, and the Lord JESUS CHRIST. The Language, the Pretence, the very <HI>Motto</HI> of a <HI>Church</HI>&punc; is that; 1 Joh. 1.3. <HI>Truly our Fellow&s;hip is with the Father, and with His Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> In a <HI>Church,</HI> the Children of Men pre&s;ent their <HI>Offerings</HI> unto GOD; and in a <HI>Church,</HI> GOD Vi&s;its the Children of Men, with <HI>Communications</HI> of Light and Life and Grace unto them. A <HI>Temple</HI> is made for this Purpo&s;e; That there may be upon <HI>Earth,</HI> in the Devotions of Men, Some <HI>Conformity</HI> to what is doing in <HI>Heaven</HI>; And that here may be a fit <HI>Recepta|cle,</HI> to take in Such <HI>Communications</HI> from <HI>Hea|ven,</HI> as God will favour Men upon <HI>Earth</HI> withal. This, This is the very purpo&s;e of a <HI>Church,</HI> 'Tis made, that <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> may therein come &s;weetly together; 'Tis made, that <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> may therein Con|ver&s;e with one another.</P>
<P>Secondly. It is to be Remembred, That a <HI>Church</HI> is to take its mea&s;ures, in many Things, from the <HI>Temple,</HI> which the Lord had of old, in the Land of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> There was a <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> built for the Special Service of GOD, according to a <HI>Pattern which God had &s;hown him,</HI> of what is Exi&s;ting, and Managed, in the <HI>Heavenly World</HI> There was a <HI>Second Edition</HI> of the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> in an Illu&s;tri|ous
<PB N="10" REF="001408_0011_0FB2FB36DF74FA80">
<HI>Temple,</HI> built by <HI>Solomon,</HI> for the Speci|al Service of GOD, according to the <HI>Further Directions,</HI> which the Vi&s;ions of God, had given unto his Father <HI>David</HI>; who had a clearer view than <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had, of particularly, the <HI>Throne of Glory,</HI> in the <HI>Third Heaven,</HI> or that Apartment of the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> which was an&s;wered, by, <HI>The Holy of Holies,</HI> in the <HI>Temple.</HI> The Dying Servant of God, left that charge; 1 Chron. 22.19. <HI>Now &s;et your Heart and your Soul, to Seek the Lord your God; Ari&s;e therefore, and Build ye the Sanctuary of the Lord.</HI> This <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD, is now laid in A&s;hes. GOD has fulfill'd unto the Jews, His Threatning; <HI>Your Hou&s;e &s;hall be Left unto you De&s;olate.</HI> The Jews are making that bitter complaint; <HI>Our Holy and our Beauteous Hou&s;e, where our Fathers Prai&s;ed thee, is burnt up with Fire.</HI> But the <HI>Temple</HI> was built on a Spot of Land, bought of a <HI>Gentile</HI>! GOD has many a <HI>Temple</HI> now in the Land of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Every CHURCH of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is now to be a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. It is remarkable, That all the <HI>Furniture</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> Seen by <HI>John,</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> is introduced, as <HI>Liv|ing.</HI> The very <HI>Lamps,</HI> are <HI>Spirits</HI>; The very <HI>Horns</HI> of the <HI>Altar</HI> have a <HI>Voice</HI>; The <HI>Throne</HI> it &s;elf <HI>Speaks.</HI> A <HI>Church</HI> is more like the <HI>Tem|ple</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> than any <HI>Inanimate Compo&s;ition</HI> that has been called a <HI>Temple.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Living,</HI> every part of it. But that it may have the more of a <HI>Temple</HI> in it, what was in
<PB N="11" REF="001408_0012_0FB2FB3841C91F70">
the <HI>Temple</HI> of old, mu&s;t be <HI>Imitated</HI> and <HI>Spiritualized</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of the LORD. A <HI>Church</HI> is to con&s;ider, what was to be <HI>Seen,</HI> and what was to be <HI>Done,</HI> in the <HI>Tem|ple;</HI> and to take its Mea&s;ures accordingly. I fore-&s;ee&punc; That I mu&s;t anon Re&s;ume this Admonition.</P>
<P>But if a <HI>Church</HI> be a <HI>Temple,</HI> Methinks All that are in the <HI>Church</HI> are hence Admo|ni&s;hed. <HI>Holine&s;s becomes this Hou&s;e for ever!</HI></P>
<P>It becomes them, to take up this Re&s;olu|tion.
<Q>Well; I am in an <HI>Holy Place</HI>: I am where the <HI>Holy God</HI> is pre&s;ent, with Singu|lar Di&s;coveries of Him&s;elf. Oh! Let me be very <HI>Holy.</HI> In &s;uch an <HI>Holy Place,</HI> Let me do nothing Offen&s;ive unto the Lord, who is <HI>greatly to be feared in the A&s;&s;embly of the Holy Ones, and to be had in Reverence of all them that are about Him.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> But what <HI>Regard</HI> &s;hould the <HI>Parts</HI> of a <HI>Church</HI> have to one another? They &s;hould ly well <HI>Together,</HI> that they may be a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. A <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST mu&s;t have this property, <HI>Built together.</HI> It cannot pretend unto the <HI>Con&s;i&s;tency</HI> of a TEMPLE, if it be not &s;o.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. By a <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> the &s;eve|ral <HI>Parts</HI> of a <HI>Church</HI> are to be Brought and Laid well <HI>Together.</HI> While men ly <HI>Scat|tered</HI> one from another, and are not come
<PB N="12" REF="001408_0013_0FB2FB39E0932068">
<HI>Voluntarily <HI>together</HI>,</HI> and are not come into a <HI>Voluntary Relation</HI> unto each other, they cannot be a <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. And how can they do this, but by a <HI>Mutual Confaederation</HI>? The Formation of a <HI>Church,</HI> is by a <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> wherein men bind them&s;elves to Walk toge|ther, according to the <HI>Order of the Go&s;pel.</HI> 'Tis a Sacred <HI>Corporation.</HI> Every <HI>Corpora|tion</HI> is made &s;o by a <HI>Covenant.</HI> It mu&s;t be by a <HI>Covenant,</HI> that men are <HI>Incorporated</HI> into an Evangelical <HI>Church-State</HI> before the Lord. Tho' the Hazard of having the <HI>Word</HI> mi&s;|con&s;trued among Malignant Enemies, might make the Apo&s;tles forbear u&s;ing the Word, <HI>Covenant,</HI> yet we find the Thing in the Apo&s;tolical Writings.

<P>Briefly, The <HI>Covenant</HI> for the Duties of the <HI>Church-State,</HI> is the <HI>Cement</HI> of a <HI>Church.</HI> The <HI>Stones</HI> of a <HI>Temple</HI> are to be well <HI>Cemen|ted</HI> and <HI>&V;nited</HI> unto one another, by an Holy <HI>Covenant.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Church-Members,</HI> You have given your &s;elves unto the <HI>Church</HI> whereto you do be|long; Engaging, <HI>That in the Fellow&s;hip thereof you will attend upon the Ordinances of the Glo|rious Go&s;pel, while your Opportunities to be there|by Edified in your mo&s;t Holy Faith &s;hall be conti|nued.</HI> There is much that you have now to <HI>Do Together,</HI> in waiting on the Lord, that So you may be <HI>Built Together</HI> as a <HI>Temple of the Lord</HI></P>
<P>There are <HI>Duties,</HI> which the ELDERS of the <HI>Church,</HI> are to do towards the <HI>Brethren.</HI> Oh! That our Glorious LORD would help

<P>I readily acknowledge, Very many, very awful are the <HI>Duties</HI> of the <HI>Elders.</HI> But will my doing &s;o, obtain for me the Liberty now to &s;ay, <HI>That the Duties between the Elders and the People are Mutual</HI>?

But &s;omething of a more particular Impor|tance, than all of this, mu&s;t be Spoken unto the <HI>People,</HI> who are this Day becoming a a <HI>Temple</HI> for the LORD.</P>
<P>Brethren; 'Tis a very Great Glory, which is this Day put upon you, by this Glorious ONE.

<P>May this CHURCH of the Lord, be &s;uch a TEMPLE, and &s;o accommodated; Then &s;hall we &s;ay, <HI>'Tis Good to be here.</HI></P>
<P>I will not break off, till I have Illu&s;trated that Saying, with quoting Two pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>One Pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t be from our Incompara|ble <HI>Goodwin,</HI> who having de&s;cribed, the Grand Intention of a <HI>Congregational Church,</HI> com|ing together,
<Q><HI>To Wor&s;hip the Lord, and Edify One another in all His Holy Ordinances</HI>;</Q> adds, <Q>'Tis an <HI>Honourable</HI> A&s;&s;embly, wherein CHRIST is the Head! And they meet, not for the Good of the <HI>Common wealth</HI> directly; tho' that be honourable, yet it is nothing to the Salvation of Souls, and the Edifying of One another in the Fear of God. How there|fore
<PB N="30" REF="001408_0031_0FB2FB6550C07F78">
&s;hould all matters be carried? There &s;hould nothing appear but the <HI>Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t</HI>; the Love of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Power of His <HI>Grace</HI>: And then, they are the mo&s;t <HI>honourable</HI> Meetings in the World!</Q></P>
<P>Another Pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t be, from our celebrated <HI>Shepard</HI>; who in a <HI>Manu&s;cript,</HI> which I have in my hands, relates the Gathering of the Church at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> quickly after his coming into <HI>New England,</HI> and the condition of his own Vertuous Con&s;ort at that time very near her Death, of a Con&s;umption. The Relation has the&s;e words in it.
<Q>It plea&s;ed the Lord to joyn us into <HI>Church-fellow&s;hip.</HI> After the Day was ended, we came to her Chamber, She being unable to come unto us. And becau&s;e we feared, her End was not far off, we did &s;olemnly ask her, <HI>If &s;he was de&s;irous to be a Member with us.</HI> Which &s;he Expre&s;&s;ing&punc; and &s;o Entring into <HI>Covenant</HI> with us, we there|upon all took her by the hand, and received her as become One with us&punc; having had full Trial &amp; Experience of her Faith &amp; Life be|fore. At this Time, and by this means, the Lord did not only &s;how us the worth of this Ordinance, but gave us a Seal of His Accep|ting of us, and of His Pre&s;ence with us <HI>that Day.</HI> For the Lord hereby fill'd her Heart, with &s;uch un&s;peakable Joy and A&s;&s;urance of Gods Love, that She &s;aid to us, <HI>She had now Enough</HI>; and we were afraid, her Feeble Body, would have at that time fallen, under the
<PB N="31" REF="001408_0032_0FB2FB66C7493818">
weight of her Joy. Thus She told me; <HI>Tho' in my Judgment&punc; I &s;aw that the Lord had Loved me, yet in my Affection I fear'd, that there might be &s;ome flaw in my Heart, Some Sin in my Soul, which might Separate between me &amp; my God, at the La&s;t, which I neither Saw, nor Others could di&s;cern: But now, by this Ordinance, the Lord hath Satisfied &amp; driven away my Fears. I look on my Entrance into the Church of Christ here, as a Re&s;emblance &amp; Fore-runner, of my Entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven among the Saints there. And tho' I know, that Hypocrites are, &amp; may be received into the Bo&s;om of the Church, yet I am willing the Lord &s;hould try me, &amp; mend me, and by this Means, He hath Sealed it unto me, that I am not One of them.</HI> And thus, a Fort|night almo&s;t before her Death, unto her Departure, in the mid&s;t of mo&s;t bitter Afflicti|ons &amp; angui&s;hes, her Peace continued.</Q></P>
<P>I return to the <HI>Temple.</HI> May this <HI>Church,</HI> be &s;uch a <HI>Temple</HI>; Then, as there were <HI>Che|rubims</HI> on the Walls of the <HI>Temple,</HI> the very <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD, will take Plea&s;ure, to Behold you, to Befriend you.</P>
<P>Yea, Then, The Glorious LORD Him&s;elf, will afford a mo&s;t gracious Pre&s;ence of His unto You. And, <HI>Lord, If thou wilt be here, we &s;hall not Dye; nor &s;hall the Souls of our Children Dye</HI>!</P>
<P>The Name of this <HI>Church</HI> will be, <HI>Iehovah Shammah,</HI> THE LORD IS THERE.</P>
