<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of tho&s;e villages, immediately under the ridge of chalky hills, called the South Downs, where the &s;oil changing &s;uddenly to a &s;trong clay, renders the country deep, and the roads bad; there dwelt, a few years &s;ince, the rector of a neighbouring pari&s;h, of the name of Le&s;&s;ington. In the village where he lived, he was only the curate; e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g his re&s;idence there, becau&s;e the hou&s;e was larger and more commodious, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that which belonged to his own living, three miles di&s;tant. His family con&s;i&s;ted of a wife, two &s;ons, and four daughters.</P>
<P>One of the &s;ons had a fellow&s;hip at Oxford. The other was a younger partner in a re&s;pectable trade&s;man's hou&s;e in London.</P>
<P>The daughters were reckoned hand&s;ome. The two elde&s;t had been, for &s;ome years, the toa&s;ts at the convivial meetings in the next market towns. The third was now a candidate for an equal &s;hare
<PB N="2" REF="029524_0004_0FE1D3365509AE60">
of ru&s;tic admiration, and her claims were gene|rally allowed. But the younge&s;t, who was about eighteen, when this narrative commences, though &s;he was &s;till con&s;idered as a child by her &s;i&s;ters, and treated as &s;uch by her mother; was thought by &s;ome of the few per&s;ons who happened to &s;ee her, to be much the hand&s;ome&s;t of the four, though her beauty was of a very different cha|racter from that of her &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>Perhaps in the&s;e days of refinement the ima|gination might be in &s;ome degree a&s;&s;i&s;ted, by the romantic &s;ingularity of her name. She was called Ro&s;alie at the reque&s;t of a lady of the Catholic religion, the wife of a man of very large fortune, who &s;ometimes inhabited an old family &s;eat, about three miles farther from the hills. Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington had been for &s;ome years her mo&s;t intimate friend, and accepted with plea&s;ure her offer of an&s;wering for, and giving her name, to the younge&s;t of her girls. Mrs. Vyvian, the daughter of an illu&s;trious Catholic family, being born at Naples, had received the name of the female &s;aint &s;o highly venerated in the two Sicilies; and before her marriage, had lived a good deal alone with an infirm father at Holm|wood Hou&s;e, which, having de&s;cended to her mother from noble ance&s;tors, became hers, and was part of the great fortune &s;he brought to Mr. Vyvian.</P>
<P>During the &s;olitary years when &s;he attended the couch of a parent, the victim of complicated di&s;ea&s;es, the &s;ociety of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington had been her greate&s;t con&s;olation. It continued &s;o till her
<PB N="3" REF="029524_0005_0FE1D33888EFEEF0">
marriage&mdash;a marriage which &s;he was compelled to con&s;ent to, by her father's peremptory com|mands. Mrs. Vyvian afterwards pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years on the continent with her hu&s;band; and returned to England mother of three children, a &s;on and two daughters. And whenever this fa|mily inhabited the old man&s;ion-hou&s;e of Holm|wood, Ro&s;alie pa&s;&s;ed all her time with them. When young Vyvian was about thirteen, his &s;i&s;ters twelve and eleven, the young ladies were &s;o much attached to their companion, that Mrs. Vyvian, to indulge them, took her with them to London, and afterwards to their e&s;tate in the North. Young Vyvian, the only &s;on of the fa|mily, being &s;ent abroad, Ro&s;alie remained with his mother and &s;i&s;ters above two years, making only &s;hort vi&s;its at home. At the end of that period, Mr. Vyvian thought proper to have his daughters introduced into the world, and in a &s;tile of life to which Ro&s;alie could have no pre|ten&s;ions. She therefore returned to the par&s;onage; and though &s;he could not but be &s;en&s;ible of the great change in her &s;ituation, her good &s;en&s;e, and the peculiar mildne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, ena|bled her, if not to conquer her regret, at lea&s;t &s;o far to conceal it, that, though generally pen|&s;ive, &s;he was neither &s;ullen nor melancholy; and entered with placid re&s;ignation into a way of life, &s;o different from that to which &s;he had (&s;he now thought unfortunately) been accu&s;tomed.&mdash;Her mother, who probably remembered that &s;he had been &s;en&s;ible of &s;omething like the &s;ame unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation when &s;he bade adieu to the &s;ociety of
<PB N="4" REF="029524_0006_0FE1D33D30F32C78">
her friend, then Mi&s;s Montalbert, to marry Mr&punc; Le&s;&s;ington, &s;eemed to pity, though &s;he forbore to notice, the dejection which was occa&s;ionally vi&s;ible in her younge&s;t daughter, in de&s;pite of her endeavours to hide it. As to her father, he treat|ed her as he did the re&s;t, with general kindne&s;s, but no marked affection. Her &s;i&s;ters were not unkind to her, &s;o long as &s;he affected no &s;uperiori|ty, but &s;eemed better plea&s;ed to be con&s;idered as too young to be admitted of their parties, than to make one, where &s;he knew &s;he &s;hould find no enjoyment: And they were, on their parts, content to leave out, as long as they could, a per&s;on who would be at lea&s;t a formidable competitor for the prize of beauty. The elde&s;t was courted by a gentleman-farmer of con&s;iderable property in the county, the &s;econd by an attorney in a neighbouring town: And as the&s;e lovers were accepted, parties of plea&s;ure were continually ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the Mi&s;s Le&s;&s;ingtons&mdash;&s;ometimes to the &s;ea coa&s;t, or the races or cricket matches, Mr. Le&s;&s;ington attended his daughters on the&s;e expeditions, till the elde&s;t was married. The care of Mi&s;s Catharine and Mi&s;s Maria, was then left to her; and the Vicar of Mayfield returned to the duties of his pari&s;hes, and his farm.</P>
<P>On the&s;e occa&s;ions, Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington and her younge&s;t daughter being left alone, their conver|&s;ation &s;ometimes turned on the family of Vyvian. It was a &s;ubject of which Ro&s;alie was never weary, though it was not always that her mother would indulge her with talking upon it. Ro&s;alie was ten|derly and gratefully attached to Mrs. Vyvian, even
<PB N="5" REF="029524_0007_0FE1D33FD11E6E58">
more than to her young friends; and frequently mentioned to her mother, how much &s;he had been hurt at remarking, during the latter part of her &s;tay in the family, that this amiable and ex|cellent woman was extremely unhappy. One day when they were &s;itting at work together, this conver&s;ation was renewed&mdash;"You hear nothing, Madam," &s;aid Ro&s;alie to her mother, "of our neighbours at Holmwood Park, being to come down &s;oon."&mdash;"Nothing," replied her mother coldly; "I &s;uppo&s;e, from what Mr. Allingham &s;aid," (Mr. Allingham was the Catholic prie&s;t of the neighbouring town), "that we &s;hall not &s;ee them here this year."&mdash;Ro&s;alie &s;ighed.&mdash;"He told me" added Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, "that Mrs. Vyvian was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed when he &s;aw her in town, that the phy&s;icians talked of order|ing her to Cheltenham. It is more than two months &s;ince I have had a letter from her."&mdash; Ro&s;alie &s;ighed again.&mdash;"It is her mind" &s;aid &s;he, "that preys upon her frame; and will I am afraid, de&s;troy her."</P>
<P>"I hope not," replied Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, "for I think her &s;pirits have been always much the &s;ame &s;ince I knew her. Perhaps they are not mended by Mr. Vyvian's having renounced his religion, and by having her children brought up Prote&s;t|ants, contrary to his promi&s;e, when he him&s;elf changed. Be&s;ides, you know he is a har&s;h and ha&s;ty man, po&s;itive, violent, and ill-natured enough to make a woman, like Mrs. Vyvian, unhappy, if there is no <HI>other</HI> cau&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="029524_0008_0FE1D3416D255B98">"Ah! that <HI>other,</HI>" &s;aid Ro&s;alie: "I have heard a great deal about it."</P>
<P>"About what?" cried Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington in a tone of &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"About the&mdash;the&mdash;the lover," replied Ro&s;alie, blu&s;hing "that Mrs. Vyvian was &s;o much at|tached to before &s;he was married to Mr. Vyvian."</P>
<P>"I don't know," &s;aid her mother, colouring as if by &s;ympathy, "who could tell you, child, of any &s;uch fooli&s;h &s;tory."</P>
<P>"Nay, dear Madam, but was it not &s;o?"</P>
<P>"Was it not, how? <HI>I</HI> really know nothing about it; and yet I believe nobody &s;aw &s;o much of my friend Mrs. Vyvian, as I did at that time; for though it was long after I married, I u&s;ed to be almo&s;t as much with her as when we were both &s;ingle."</P>
<P>"The gentleman is &s;till living, Madam," &s;aid Ro&s;alie.</P>
<P>"I again a&s;&s;ure you, Ro&s;e," replied her mother, peevi&s;hly, "that I know nothing of&mdash;of <HI>any</HI> gen|tleman. But I think I heard your father come into his &s;tudy&mdash;Do, child, a&s;k him for the key of the clo&s;et above."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie obeyed. But &s;he well knew her father was not in his &s;tudy, and &s;aw that her mother only &s;ent her to &s;eek him, that &s;he might e&s;cape from conver&s;ation, which, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, &s;he was &s;trangely unwilling to continue. This was not the fir&s;t time Ro&s;alie had remarked, that her mother &s;olicitou&s;ly avoided recounting any circum&s;tance that u&s;ed to happen in her gir|li&s;h days, at tho&s;e periods when &s;he was con|nected
<PB N="7" REF="029524_0009_0FE1D3439DA0BF50">
with the family of Montalbert: and if ever &s;he uncon&s;ciou&s;ly began to &s;peak of Mi&s;s Montalbert, now Mrs. Vyvian, &s;he either &s;top|ped as &s;oon as &s;he recollected her&s;elf, and chang|ed the conver&s;ation, or &s;poke in a manner par|ticularly guarded, and only of trifling occurren|ces.</P>
<P>"What can be my mother's rea&s;on?" &s;aid Ro&s;alie, mu&s;ing to her&s;elf as &s;he went to walk in their little garden. "There is &s;ome my&s;tery certainly. Surely the marriage with the man Mrs. Vyvian was &s;o attached to, could not have been broken off on <HI>her</HI> account?&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible! for though my mother, I believe, has been a very hand&s;ome woman, &s;he certainly never could be compared to her friend; who even now, in ill health, and half heart-broken, as &s;he is, is much more beautiful than either of her daughters."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie &s;ighing when &s;he thought of Mrs. Vyvian's illne&s;s, and regretting that &s;he did not this year come into the country, felt all the cold and blank regret, which departed plea&s;ure leaves. She wi&s;hed now, that &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed le&s;s time in the Vyvian family, where &s;he had been accu&s;|tomed to the conver&s;ation of Mrs. Vyvian, of which &s;he was particularly fond; and to a man|ner of life, very different from that which &s;he was now in&mdash;&s;till more different, from what it was probable &s;he would be expected to enter into, when her two elder &s;i&s;ters were both married: her father having lately &s;aid, half laughingly, and as if he &s;uppo&s;ed it would plea&s;e her, that &s;he &s;hould then go out with Maria; appear at
<PB N="8" REF="029524_0010_0FE1D3484FCA05D0">
a&s;&s;emblies, and try to get an hu&s;band too; for he wanted to get his girls off his hands as fa&s;t as he could.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie felt, that &s;he had an invincible aver&s;ion to this plan of dre&s;&s;ing and going out in hopes of getting as her father termed it, an hu&s;band. She was convinced, that to be addre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch men as the hu&s;band of her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, or the man to whom the &s;econd was &s;oon to be married, would render her completely mi&s;erable; for it &s;eemed but too probable, that her father would not allow her a negative.</P>
<P>Youth, however, dwells not long on remote po&s;&s;ibilities. But though no acute unea&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;ailed her, the languor and dejection of Ro&s;alie increa&s;ed as the Autumn came on. Solitude was infinitely preferable to the &s;ociety, &s;uch as was at pre&s;ent within her reach: But &s;eclu&s;ion &s;o per|fect as that &s;he was now condemned to, depre&s;&s;|ed her &s;pirits. In every other period of her be|ing at home, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, her elder brother had been there al&s;o, who, being very par|tial to her, delighted to in&s;truct her. But now this dear brother was gone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto the North with one of his college friends, and was to be at home only for a few days before his return to Oxford. She thought every body was gone to the North; for the Vyvian family were perhaps there by this time, if Mrs. Vyvian's health had allowed her to leave Cheltenham; and never had &s;he felt &s;o de|jected and forlorn. The hill which aro&s;e imme|diately behind the vicarage hou&s;e, afforded a view even half way up, of a great extent of coun|try;

and Holmwood Park, the old family &s;eat of Mr. Vyvian, though at near three miles di&s;tance, &s;eemed to be within five minutes walk. Ro&s;alie had now a melancholy plea&s;ure, in viewing it from the high grounds, as the &s;etting &s;un blazed on the we&s;tern windows, while the characters of the inhabitants were forcibly recalled to her mind.</P>
<P>Mr. Vyvian, a man of very exten&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and the head of an ancient Catholic family, had been rather received as an hu&s;band by Mi&s;s Montalbert, becau&s;e her father commanded her to receive him, than for any other rea&s;on; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o far were they from having any &s;ympathy, that their religion was the only thing in which they agreed; and even that tie of union between them did not long exi&s;t: for &s;oon after the death of his wife's father, he renounced the church of Rome, and going through all the ceremonies of reconci|liation to that of England, entitled him&s;elf to re|pre&s;ent a borough that belonged to him, and became a member of parliament. From that time, the tutors that had been entru&s;ted with the edu|cation of his &s;on, were removed. His daughters, contrary to the promi&s;e he had at fir&s;t made to his wife, were no longer &s;uffered to go to ma&s;s, or to be in&s;tructed by the old prie&s;t, who had for a great number of years re&s;ided in their mother's hou&s;e. And Mrs. Vyvian&punc; who was &s;trongly attached to the religion of her ance&s;tors, was from that period a &s;olitary and de&s;olate being in the mid&s;t of her family.</P>
<P>Mr. Vyvian was one of tho&s;e men, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|turally haughty and tyrannical, had never u&s;e

becau&s;e he never would endure, the lea&s;t contra|diction. His temper re&s;embled that of tho&s;e rea|&s;onable beings one &s;ometimes &s;ees among the common people, who not unfrequently beat their children till they make them cry; and then beat them for crying. Ju&s;t &s;o he contrived to do ex|actly what he knew would make his wife com|pletely mi&s;erable; and then quarrelled with her becau&s;e &s;he could not (though &s;he endeavoured to do &s;o mo&s;t &s;incerely), always conceal her wretch|edne&s;s. Till lately, &s;he had found the e&s;trange|ment of her daughters, who too much re&s;em|bled their father, compen&s;ated in a great mea&s;ure by the attentive gratitude of Ro&s;alie, who u&s;ed to pa&s;s much of her time at Holmwood, while Mrs. Vyvian was there alone, and her family remained in London. But lately &s;he appeared to have lo&s;t all plea&s;ure, even in vi&s;iting this favorite &s;eat; and though when &s;he did write to Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, or to Ro&s;alie, her letters expre&s;&s;ed all her former regard, yet the&s;e letters became every day more rare. At length &s;he hardly ever wrote to Ro&s;alie. An air of languor and di&s;quiet pervaded tho&s;e parts of the letters addre&s;&s;ed to her mother, that Ro&s;alie &s;ometimes &s;aw; for it now and then happened, that Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington received letters which her daughter knew to be from Mrs. Vyvian, the contents of which &s;he never di&s;clo&s;ed, and did not &s;eem plea&s;ed to be que&s;tioned upon them.&mdash;The&s;e Ro&s;alie concluded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> filled with the murmurs of an oppre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that found a melancholy indulgence in view eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its hopele&s;s &s;orrows into the bo&s;om of an

old and faithful friend; though &s;he her&s;elf had never heard one repining &s;entence.</P>
<P>The venerable prie&s;t, now the only inhabitant, except &s;ervants, of the &s;olitary man&s;ion of Holm|wood, had been accu&s;tomed to walk over now and then to Barlton-Brook, (the name of the pa|ri&s;h where the Le&s;&s;ington family re&s;ided); and Ro&s;alie, who honoured his character, and knew how highly Mrs. Vyvian e&s;teemed him, was never happier than when &s;he was allowed to make his tea for him, or to walk with him part of the way home. During the pre&s;ent &s;ummer, how|ever, the&s;e vi&s;its had become le&s;s frequent, and at length entirely cea&s;ed; a terrible deprivation to Ro&s;alie, though none of the re&s;t of the family &s;eemed con&s;cious that it had happened. Ro&s;alie at length remarked it to her mother, who an|&s;wered drily, that Mr. Hayward was probably ill. "May I not walk over &s;ome day to Holmwood Mamma, and &s;ee how he does?"</P>
<P>"I do not know when I can &s;pare you, my dear," was the reply, and the conver&s;ation drop|ped.</P>
<P>Another, and another week pa&s;&s;ed; and Mr. Hayward did not appear. Ro&s;alie then enquired news of him, of one of tho&s;e itinerant fi&s;hmon|gers who travel round the country, and who con&s;tantly carried his wares to Holmwood. The man a&s;&s;ured her, that he had that day &s;een Mr. Hayward in good health. Ro&s;alie &s;oon after|wards di&s;covered, but with extreme vexation, that her old friend forbore to vi&s;it her, becau&s;e it had been hinted to him, that the &s;u&s;picion of
<PB N="12" REF="029524_0014_0FE1D3538B7430A0">
his influencing her on religious &s;ubjects was likely to be very injurious to her future pro&s;pects in the world: Mr. Grier&s;on, who had married her elder &s;i&s;ter, and Mr. Blagham, the intended hu&s;band of the &s;econd, having declared their ap|prehen&s;ions of her becoming a Papi&s;t; in which opinion two young men, who had very much ad|mired her, al&s;o agreed. The &s;i&s;ters of one of them prote&s;ting that <HI>she was sure Miss Rose Lessington was disposed to that religion, which made her give into such mopish ways, and always affect soli|tude, like nuns, and such sort of people.</HI> Thus de|prived of the innocent plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing with a man, whom, from her infancy, &s;he had con&s;ider|ed almo&s;t as a &s;econd father&mdash;a cypher at home&mdash; and rather &s;uffered as one of the family, than &s;eeming to make a part of it, nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of the re&s;t, Ro&s;alie had no other re|&s;ource than in her own mind again&s;t the unvary|ing medium of life. Her mother though not more ignorant than the generality of women in middling life, had received no better education than a country boarding &s;chool afforded, which, five and thirty years ago, were much le&s;s cele|brated for the <HI>accomplishments</HI> they communica|ted, than they are at pre&s;ent. Since that period, &s;he had &s;tudied the <HI>utile</HI> rather than the <HI>dulce.</HI> Having, before her marriage, lived very much in the family of Montalbert, though by no means in the &s;tyle of an humble companion (for &s;he had a &s;mall independent fortune), &s;he had accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to undertake many little dome&s;tic duties for the friend &s;he loved; and after her marriage,
<PB N="13" REF="029524_0015_0FE1D356007EE848">
&s;he had a family which kept her con&s;tantly occu|pied; &s;o that, never having her curio&s;ity rai&s;ed in regard to books, and never having been accu&s;|tomed to read, &s;he had now no reli&s;h even for books of amu&s;ement; and wondered at the eager|ne&s;s &s;he &s;ometimes heard her acquaintance ex|pre&s;s for them. It may ea&s;ily be believed, that thus di&s;po&s;ed, &s;he had no collection of books likely to amu&s;e her daughter; who had long &s;ince exhau&s;ted all the information or entertain|ment afforded, by an odd volume of the Tatler&mdash; Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe&mdash;Nel&s;on's Fea&s;ts and Fa&s;ts&mdash; Hervey's Meditations&mdash;a volume of Echard's Gazetteer&mdash;Mrs. Gla&s;s's Cookery&mdash;and every Lady her own Hou&s;e-keeper.</P>
<P>The library of Mr. Le&s;&s;ington, though more exten&s;ive and occupying a room dignified with the name of a &s;tudy, was not better adapted to be|guile the &s;olitary hours of a very young woman. It con&s;i&s;ted &s;olely of &s;ermons&mdash;Polemics&mdash;&s;uch publications as related to Que&s;tions on infant Bapti&s;m, and Elaborate Defences of the Thirty-nine Articles&mdash;Clarendon's Hi&s;tory&mdash;Rapin, and bad Tran&s;lations of Mezerai and Froi&s;&s;art&mdash;an old Hi&s;tory of Rome, in black letters&mdash;Jo&s;ephus &mdash;Thomas a Kempis&mdash;Elucidations of difficult Parts of Scripture&mdash;and Treati&s;es on the Nature of the Soul. Among all the&s;e it was the hi&s;|tory only that could attract Ro&s;alie; and du|ring this &s;olitary &s;ummer, &s;he became a tolerable hi&s;torian: though &s;he did not find it either con|tributed to enlarge her philanthropy, or furni&s;h her with rules for the conduct of her life; &s;ince

&s;he flattered her&s;elf, that beings &s;o di&s;hone&s;t and de&s;picable as modern hi&s;tory repre&s;ents, are found only in tho&s;e elevated regions of human exi&s;tence where it was never likely to be her lot to move.</P>
<P>During her frequent vi&s;its to the family of Vy|vian, where that language was generally &s;poken, Ro&s;alie had learnt to &s;peak French fluently; could read well, and &s;peak a little Italian, which Mr. Hayward had taken great plea&s;ure in teach|ing her. The&s;e little acquirements were, &s;he knew not for what rea&s;on, more the object of her &s;i&s;ters' envy than any other of the advantages her being with the Mi&s;s Vyvians might have given her over them. She &s;aw with &s;urpri&s;e and con|cern, that though her &s;i&s;ters were as little, as &s;he now was her&s;elf, in company where to &s;peak foreign languages, could be of the &s;lighte&s;t ad|vantage, yet that <HI>her</HI> being qualified to do &s;o, vexed and humbled them. She therefore con|cealed what indeed there was now little merit, and le&s;s difficulty in concealing; and having no books to read in either language, and no longer an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> opportunity of conver&s;ing with Mr. Hayward, &s;he felt, with infinite concern, that this &s;ource of amu&s;ement and of knowledge would very &s;oon be lo&s;t to her.</P>
<P>The only plea&s;ure &s;he now found was in draw|ing; in which, though no great proficient, &s;he was far enough advanced to find her&s;elf improve very materially, by following, and continually practi&s;ing the few rules &s;he had learned. To &s;eat her&s;elf on the turf of the down above the hou&s;e, on the root of a thorn, or one of tho&s;e

And very &s;incerely did &s;he regret, and very reluctantly did &s;he obey, the &s;ummons, &s;he too frequently received to return to the hou&s;e, either to make tea for &s;ome accidental vi&s;itors of her new brother-in-law's acquaintance, or to &s;uperintend a &s;yllabub in the &s;ummer hou&s;e.&mdash; The&s;e parties calling at the par&s;onage, now be|came frequent; for this new member of the fami|ly lived in the vale, a few miles from Barlton Brook; and the hou&s;e of his father-in-law lay directly in the hor&s;e way to what is called in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> country, "up the hills." Tho&s;e hills (the South Downs) gradually decline towards the &s;ea. On the coa&s;t, within a few years, many bathing pla|ces have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, where the &s;ick and the idle pa&s;s the &s;ummer or autumnal months. The variety of people thus collected make a vi&s;it to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, a plea&s;urable jaunt to the inhabitants of the neighbouring country; and Mr. Grier&s;on, a man perfectly at ea&s;e in his circum&s;tances, and lately married to one of the mo&s;t celebrated beau|ties in the county, failed not to amu&s;e his bride and her friends with many of the&s;e tours. His fu|ture brother-in-law, Blagham the attorney, who lived at Chiche&s;ter, was a great promoter of what he called "a little &s;ociability." He gratified at once two pa&s;&s;ions; the love of what he called plea&s;ure, and the pro&s;pect of future advantage,
<PB N="16" REF="029524_0018_0FE1D35FA73166C8">
to which he always looked forward with peculiar earne&s;tne&s;s. While he was bu&s;tling about with Grier&s;on and his wife, together with his "own intended," as he cho&s;e to call her, he was di&s;play|ing his &s;kill in ordering dinners, in hiring boats for water-parties, in con&s;oling "<HI>the ladies,</HI>" when they were &s;ick, and, "<HI>cutting jokes upon them when they got better</HI>"&mdash;in making &s;ure bets at Broad <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A down in Hamp&s;hire, on the borders of Su&s;&s;ex, the re&s;ort of both counties for cricket matches.</NOTE> Halfpenny, for "Egad, Sir, he always knew what he was about"&mdash;and in hedging well at poney races. And while this went on, "Egad, Sir, he never lo&s;t &s;ight of the main chance&mdash;not he. Egad, Sir, he had all his eyes about him."</P>
<P>And it was true, that while thus entered into what he called "the enjoyments of life, <HI>and a little sociability,</HI>" he made acquaintance among the yeomanry, or the few of that rank of men who are &s;till <HI>called</HI> &s;o: among men, however, who had made money to put out at intere&s;t, and who employed him to find for them good &s;ecuri|ties, and to tran&s;act other matters for them. So that though a young man in the honourable pro|fe&s;&s;ion of an attorney, and newly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the already well-&s;tocked city of Chiche&s;ter, he was con&s;idered as very likely to make his fortune; and Mr. Le&s;&s;ington had, in the contemplation of &s;uch a pro&s;pect, granted him the hand of the fair Catharine, his &s;econd daughter; rich indeed only in her&s;elf&mdash;in very hand&s;ome wedding clothes, which were now preparing for her&mdash;and in her connections and acquaintance among the gentlemen's families of the county.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>IT was on a beautiful afternoon towards the end of Augu&s;t, when Ro&s;alie, retired to her u&s;ual &s;eat on the hill, was again engaged in her now favour|ite occupation. The rays of the &s;un declining early in the afternoon, gilt the land&s;cape with tints more than u&s;ually luxuriant. Holmwood Hou&s;e, its windows always lighted up when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> evening rays glanced on them, was an object which, as it continually forced it&s;elf upon her ob&s;ervation, &s;he almo&s;t for the fir&s;t time in her life wi&s;hed to e&s;cape from. Yet in&s;en&s;ibly it brought to her mind a train of ideas melancho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, yet not to be repelled. Her pencils and drawing cards were laid down on the turf, while, with folded arms, and her head reclined again&s;t the tree &s;he was &s;itting under, &s;he fell into a reverie. A long row of old pines, &s;tretched their grote&s;que heads from the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the hou&s;e towards a ri&s;ing ground, where this wild and irregular avenue was terminated by an octagon temple, now falling fa&s;t to ruin; where Ro&s;alie remembered to have pa&s;&s;ed many hours, when &s;he was a child, the happy thoughtle&s;s com|panion of the little Vyvians, who u&s;ed to call this old &s;ummer-hou&s;e their hou&s;e, and to carry thither their play things, and make their &s;portive arrangements, while their governe&s;s a little old

Frenchwoman, was accu&s;tomed to &s;it on the &s;teps knitting or netting. The &s;teps Ro&s;alie could di&s;tingui&s;h from her &s;olitary &s;eat on the hill: But the playful groupe, and their old little guardian, were gone. Ro&s;alie recollected how happy &s;he had been there: And already &s;he had acquired that painful experience that had made her fear &s;he &s;hould ta&s;te of unalloyed happine&s;s no more. Her friend and protectre&s;s, Mrs. Vyvian, who now &s;eemed to have de&s;erted, from &s;ome unac|countable change of ta&s;te, the habitation &s;he was once &s;o fond of, appeared before her in imagina|tion more pale and dejected than u&s;ual. She fancied &s;he &s;aw her &s;lowly coming out of the little con&s;ervatory, which &s;he had cau&s;ed to be built, and in which &s;he took peculiar plea&s;ure. She had a no&s;egay in her hand for each of her girls&mdash; Ro&s;alie was once received under that appellation &mdash;and &s;he beckoned to them as &s;he &s;aw them walking in the &s;hrubbery, and, with one of her pen&s;ive &s;miles, gave to every one her little pre&s;ent. The Abb&eacute; Hayward, that excellent and venera|ble man, met her. Benignity and pious re&s;ig|nation were in his countenance, as he endea|voured to find &s;ome conver&s;ation that might cheer the depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of Mrs. Vyvian. She bade her daughters and Ro&s;alie walk before them; and, making a &s;hort tour in the plantations, &s;eemed to remove her languor, and enable her to meet her family at &s;upper with &s;ome appearance of cheerfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Such were the &s;cenes Ro&s;alie was recalling to her mind, and &s;uch the figures with which me|mory
<PB N="19" REF="029524_0021_0FE1D364D92149E0">
was bu&s;y in peopling them, when her con|templations were di&s;turbed by figures very differ|ent, who pre&s;ented them&s;elves under all the di&s;advantages of contra&s;t. . . . Blagham, and two other young men, whom &s;he did not recollect ever to have &s;een before, came whooping and hallooing from the hou&s;e, and a&s;cended the hill towards her. As it &s;oon became very &s;teep, Blagham leaped from his hor&s;e, and ran towards her; and the other two followed him.</P>
<P>"Why, my &s;weet Ro&s;e," cried he, "my Ro&s;e of the world! why do you cruelly hide your&s;elf among thorns? Only to be looked after &mdash;eh! my pretty Ro&s;e,&mdash;Aye, 'tis the way of you all:&mdash;there's my Kate below yonder, would fain &s;erve me the &s;ame &s;auce&mdash;but I'm come to drink tea with you, my dear little &s;i&s;ter, that is to be, and to introduce two of my friends to you." The friends by this time were come to the &s;pot. "This, Madam, is Captain Mildred of the 98th, now quartered in our town; and this," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded he, with all &s;olemnity, "this is the Rev. Philibert Hugh&s;on, a worthy clergyman, and Rector of Higgin&s;ton cum Sillingbourn in this county." Ro&s;alie had nothing to do but to cur|te&s;y to them both. Her future brother-in-law, however, had not yet done with her; but, &s;tep|ping back, he made a ridiculous bow, and in a theatrical tone, exclaimed, "And, now, gentle|men, give me the &s;uperlative plea&s;ure of introduc|ing to <HI>your</HI> admiration Mi&s;s Ro&s;alie Le&s;&s;ington, fourth and younge&s;t daughter of the Rev. Jo&s;eph Le&s;&s;ington, Ma&s;ter of Arts, Vicar of Cold Hamp|ton, and Curate of Barlton Brooks in this county:
<PB N="20" REF="029524_0022_0FE1D36C4E57E3E8">
A young lady, of who&s;e per&s;onal perfections, gentlemen, I dare not &s;peak; but who is, I may venture to &s;ay, endowed with every qualification to render the marriage &s;tate completely happy." &mdash;Shocked and amazed at this impertinent ad|dre&s;s, Ro&s;alie felt her cheeks glow with anger and indignation; but recovering her&s;elf, &s;he a&s;k|ed coldly, if her mother had &s;ent for her?</P>
<P>"She has&mdash;&s;he has"&mdash;cried her per&s;ecutor, who, &s;he now perceived, had added to his natu|ral impertinence all that which liquor gives when it overflows a &s;hallow brain,&mdash;"She has, fair flower of the de&s;art, and we are the beatified amba&s;&s;adors charged with the delectable commi&s;|&s;ion. Come then, bright nymph!"&mdash;</P>
<P>He was proceeding in this &s;tyle, when Ro&s;alie, taking from him the hand he would forcibly have held, &s;aid, "I wi&s;h my mother had &s;ent &s;ome per&s;on who was more in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his rea&s;on."&mdash;"Ah! Madam," cried the young man, who was announced as the Rev. Philibert Hugh&s;on, "there are moments when rea&s;on is lo&s;t in wonder and delight, and when"&mdash; "What, Sir?" interrupted Ro&s;alie, in a tone &s;o unexpected, that the young divine was unable to proceed, and even blu&s;hed as he attempted to fini&s;h a &s;peech, which he probably thought was in the &s;tyle of the &s;ociety he was with.</P>
<P>As they walked down the hill towards the hou&s;e, &s;he turned to Captain Mildred, who, as he had hitherto been &s;ilent, had not offended her; and whom, being an officer, &s;he hoped was a gentleman, and entered with him into the com|mon

conver&s;ation, while Blagham, too drunk to make much &s;peed, &s;taggered after them, and Mr. Hugh&s;on went &s;idling down a little before her. As if &s;till &s;olicitous to attract her notice, yet half afraid of another rebuff, he was trying to recal his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elf importance.&mdash; The Rev. Philibert Hugh&s;on was what is called a dapper, tight-made, little man. His face nei|ther well nor ill, but with &s;omething in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of it that &s;oon let an ob&s;erver of faces in|to his character. If the Rev. Philibert Hugh&s;on had even ventured to think, in the &s;ame unre|&s;trained manner in which he &s;ometimes &s;poke, it is very certain he thought him&s;elf a d&mdash;d clever fellow. The &s;econd &s;on of a very rich father, he had been a buck of the fir&s;t rate at Cambridge, &s;pent four times as much as he was allowed, and contrived to get &s;ome thou&s;ands in debt. He was an excellent judge of hor&s;e-fle&s;h, and a great connoi&s;&s;eur in carriages. He knew the dimen|&s;ions and properties of every vehicle from a phaeton to a &s;ulky; had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them all by turns, and had changed them oftener than his clothes, or his friends. He had made a merit of taking orders, when he knew his careful father had bought the valuable livings of Higgin&s;ton cum Sillingbourn, worth together above eight hundred a year. Nor did he determine to make this &s;acrifice, and, from the &s;marte&s;t fellow at Cambridge, &s;ink into a country par&s;on, till he had &s;tipulated for the payment of his debts, and a hand&s;ome &s;um in ready money. He then cut off his hair, turned his green coat into a grey one,
<PB N="22" REF="029524_0024_0FE1D36F88DCF778">
and re&s;olved to be very orthodox and very good. His father mo&s;t devoutly hoping he would keep his word, complied with all his conditions, and was delighted when he had &s;worn that he felt an irre&s;i&s;tible call from heaven, and was inducted to the living of Higgin&s;ton cum Sillingbourn. The mo&s;t plea&s;ant circum&s;tance attending his new &s;ituation, was, that this cure of &s;ouls was under|taken in the be&s;t country po&s;&s;ible for killing phea|&s;ants, and not half a mile from him partridges were equally plenty. A pack of the be&s;t fox hounds in England were within five miles; and he had greyhounds of his own, of the true Orford breed. To take advantage of all the&s;e plea&s;ures, he had begun by &s;itting up and enlarging the &s;ta|bles, filling them with high-prized hunters, and &s;ending to Newmarket for boys to attend them. He &s;tored his cellars&mdash;furni&s;hed his hou&s;e for his brother &s;port&s;men who had promi&s;ed to vi&s;it him &mdash;bought a new phaeton; changed it for a curri|cle; then imagined a new whi&s;ky of his own com|po&s;ing, calculated for the Suffex roads. And, in &s;hort, during the eight months that he had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the living, had felt &s;o many irre|&s;i&s;tible impul&s;es, be&s;ides that which had given &s;o valuable a member to the church, that he had already received from the friend&s;hip of his dear friend Blagham a trifling accommodation of the 'needful'; for to apply to the old gentleman &s;o &s;oon was hardly di&s;creet; parental patience, like &s;ome other virtues, being &s;ometimes apt to wear out, if too frequently called into u&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Blagham had not been many days introdu|ced
<PB N="23" REF="029524_0025_0FE1D371267561F8">
to the Rev. Philibert Hugh&s;on, before he di&s;covered that &s;omething very advantageous might ari&s;e from cultivating his acquaintance. He perfectly under&s;tood the way to recommend him&s;elf, and &s;et about it with &s;o much zeal, that he became very &s;oon the deare&s;t friend he had in the world. . . . . . . Blagham thought he could not do better than endeavour to recommend one of the &s;i&s;ters of his intended wife: And he had already tried to per&s;uade his friend that he was in love with Maria, in which he would probably have &s;ucceeded, if, at a convivial meeting where the beauty of the neighbouring dam&s;els was can|va&s;&s;ed, &s;ome young man, who had accidentally &s;een Ro&s;alie, had not warmly a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he was the prettie&s;t girl in the county; and when another &s;poke of the celebrity of her &s;i&s;ters, agreed that they were fine women, but a&s;&s;ured Mr. Hugh&s;on, to whom he &s;at near, in half a whi&s;per, that there was no more compari&s;on between them and the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, than between light and darkne&s;s. This had greatly rai&s;ed the curio&s;ity of Hugh&s;on, who had &s;ince pre&s;&s;ed his friend Blagham to carry him to the hou&s;e of his intended father-in-law; a reque&s;t which was heard with plea&s;ure, and immediately granted.</P>
<P>Equally ra&s;h and head&s;trong in whatever he undertook, Hugh&s;on was pa&s;&s;ionately in love at fir&s;t &s;ight; and as immediately determined to pur&s;ue the object that had thus &s;truck him, no|thing doubting her ready and even joyful accept|ance of a man &s;o unexceptionable in point of for|tune, and &s;o very clever a fellow. Under this

impre&s;&s;ion he took no pains to conceal his admira|tion, but per&s;ecuted the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and reluctant Ro&s;alie with &s;peeches to which it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to reply. She looked timidly towards her father for protection: but &s;he &s;aw, that far from being willing to afford it to her, he &s;eemed delighted with the attention Mr. Hugh&s;on paid her; and &s;miled and rubbed his hands, as who &s;hould &s;ay, "Oh! oh! here comes a chapman for another of my girls."&mdash;Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington ap|peared to be impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame idea, and overwhelmed the little man with civility; while Maria, to whom he had before &s;hewn a great pre|ference, and who &s;eemed to have been much bet|ter plea&s;ed with it, was piqued at his now ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf entirely to her &s;i&s;ter; and &s;hewed that &s;he &s;everely felt the mortification, but en|deavoured to conceal her vexation, by laughing and talking with Captain Mildred, who, being one of tho&s;e military heroes who&s;e talents are greater in the field than in the cabinet, &s;he found it rather difficult to keep up the gaiety &s;he affect|ed; for Captain Mildred be&s;ides that his head was very &s;cantily &s;tocked with ideas, was too fine a man to give him&s;elf the trouble to produce the few he had, to amu&s;e a country par&s;on's daugh|ter. He only came with Blagham and Hugh&s;on, becau&s;e he had nothing better to do with him|&s;elf; and had be&s;ides an inclination to buy one of Hugh&s;on's hor&s;es, which he was in hopes of get|ting a bargain, and which he had therefore been depreciating, and trying to put the little divine out of conceit with; telling him that the hor&s;e in

the fir&s;t place had been &s;trained behind, and would never &s;tand &s;ound. "And be&s;ides," &s;aid he, "my dear Doctor, it grieves all your friends to &s;ee you upon &s;uch a tall, long-legged animal. By Heavens! Jack Norton of our regiment cal|led to me the other day, as you rode through Ea&s;t Street, and a&s;ked me who that little fellow upon the tail hor&s;e was: 'For damme,' &s;ays he, 'he puts me in mind of Tom Thumb upon an ele|phant.'&mdash;Such was Captain Mildred, on whom neither beauty nor wit could make the &s;lighte&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and who, equally &s;tupid and &s;elfi&s;h, had every qualification for a rogue, except talents. But he had a tolerable per&s;on, a red coat, and was &s;aid to be a man of fortune; &s;o that he had been reckoned among the mi&s;&s;es a very charming man, and their mammas had invited him to their concerts and their card parties.</P>
<P>Before the tea was fini&s;hed, at which Ro&s;alie &s;o reluctantly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, Mr. Hugh&s;on received from both her father and mother the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;|ing invitation to renew his vi&s;its as often as he could. "And I hope, my good Sir," cried Mr. Le&s;&s;ington, "I hope you will not let the begin|ning of the &s;hooting &s;ea&s;on deprive us of the hap|pine&s;s of &s;eeing you; for, I a&s;&s;ure you, we &s;hall have excellent &s;port round about this village. I my&s;elf know of a great number of birds. I ex|pect my &s;on too. My elde&s;t &s;on, will be here &s;hortly: and I am &s;ure he will be greatly flattered by the honour of your acquaintance."</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure he will not," &s;ighed Ro&s;alie to her&s;elf; "for never can a man be imagined

<P>Plans were now talked of for the next week, which Hugh&s;on &s;poke of as dedicated to the gun, with childi&s;h eagerne&s;s. He gave to Mr. Le&s;|&s;ington a very long and elaborate de&s;cription of a new gun he had bought, which had co&s;t him five and twenty guineas: not indeed that he wanted any &s;uch thing, for he was an admirable &s;hot&mdash; killed nineteen out of twenty, and was reckoned as &s;ure as any man in Norfolk. "I remember about two years ago," &s;aid he, "I went out, only I and my father's gamekeeper: and we killed, that is, I killed, about forty brace in about five hours; for he hardly ever fired."</P>
<P>"Birds were remarkably plenty I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid Mr. Le&s;&s;ington.</P>
<P>"Why no, really not &s;o very remarkably plenty&mdash;I have &s;een them as much &s;o: but, my dear Sir, Norfolk is the county for game. . . . why, I have &s;een, Sir, of a morning, when the birds were at feed, the very ground covered with them; &s;o that you could not have thrown a peb|ble without touching them&mdash;as clo&s;e, Sir,&mdash;as clo&s;e"&mdash;</P>
<P>Le&s;&s;ington, who by a glance from Ro&s;alie's eye, &s;aw that Hugh&s;on was doing him&s;elf di&s;&s;er|vice with her by this &s;ort of rhodomontading, &s;aved him the trouble of finding the compari&s;on he was &s;eeking for, by &s;aying, "Yes, yes&mdash;I have been in Norfolk&mdash;I know there is a pro|digious quantity of game in that county."</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="029524_0029_0FE1D37D5E98FA30">But Hugh&s;on, elevated with wine and in&s;pir|ed by love, could no longer check the violent inclination he always felt, to relate &s;ome very marvellous &s;tory, and to make him&s;elf the hero of it. He thought it was impo&s;&s;ible to find any audience better di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten and believe, with the exception only of Captain Mildred, who&s;e coldne&s;s he imputed to envy. He began, therefore, and told &s;ome of the mo&s;t extraordi|nary adventures that ever were heard:&mdash;how he once, with his &s;ingle arm, defended &s;everal offi|cers of dragoons from the in&s;ults of an enraged populace, whom &s;ome of them had offended, ju&s;t for throwing an old woman over a bridge into the river in a frolic. . . .

<P>The evident fallacy and folly of &s;uch a &s;tory would not have been tolerated in any other com|pany.

&s;he went into a cop&s;e that adjoined to it, and was pre&s;ently out of hearing the inquiries that &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed would be made for her.

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE cop&s;e into which Ro&s;alie had thrown her&s;elf, like an affrighted bird, was very exten|&s;ive, &s;tretching along the edge of the hill, and making a curve as if to let in the few hou&s;es that compo&s;ed the village. It &s;pread beyond into a very exten&s;ive wood, and there a&s;&s;umed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me of the Hunacres, probably a corruption of hundred acres. It was as wild and almo&s;t as
<PB N="30" REF="029524_0032_0FE1D3865760D148">
unfrequented as when the ancient Anderid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ought their food amid&s;t the &s;ame entangled woods, then over&s;hadowing the whole country under the hills.</P>
<P>Now, however, there were &s;ome winding paths through it, made to &s;olitary farms around: And a nobleman, to whom the greater part of it belonged, had cut ridings from the Downs to|wards his own hou&s;e in two or three directions, to facilitate the way of the &s;port&s;man. The path along which Ro&s;alie went, was &s;o intricate, that &s;he forgot how far or whither it carried her, till &s;he found it became du&s;k, and was &s;topped by arriving at one of the&s;e ridings or cuts through the wood. She then recollected how far &s;he had wandered from home, and was turning to go back, when three gentlemen on hor&s;eback, fol|lowed by two &s;ervants, came gal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oping &s;o fa&s;t from a turn in this green lane a little beyond her, that they were near her almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;he per|cei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d them. The foremo&s;t of them checking his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e, and looking at her with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, &s;aid to his companions, "Here is a young lady who, if we are not right, I am &s;ure will be &s;o obliging as to direct us."</P>
<P>Rather wondering than alarmed, Ro&s;alie &s;top|ped, and the gentleman who had fir&s;t &s;poken, &s;aid, politely taking off his hat&mdash;"We are going, Madam, to Holmwood Park, which we plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the hill, and to which my friend here, <HI>who ought to know,</HI> thought he could lead us by a nearer way than that which we were directed to take. But he now thinks he has ta|ken
<PB N="31" REF="029524_0033_0FE1D3888AC93EE8">
the wrong turning, and that we are too much to the left. Can you inform us how we can be&s;t make our way out of the wood? for if we could &s;ee the hou&s;e again, we could ea&s;ily reach it."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie was about to an&s;wer, that the way they were in, led directly to a common, which ad|joined the Park at Holmwood, when the young man, of whom the inquirer had &s;poken, as one who <HI>ought</HI> to know the way to it, jumped from his hor&s;e, and exclaimed, "I cannot have forgot|ten you, whatever el&s;e I have forgotten during two years ab&s;ence. It is Ro&s;alie, my dear play-fellow and companion."</P>
<P>"It is indeed," an&s;wered &s;he; "but, Hea|vens! Mr. Vyvian, how tall you are grown? Upon my word, I &s;hould hardly have recollected you. How is my dear Mrs. Vyvian?&mdash;How are your &s;i&s;ters?"</P>
<P>The other two gentlemen, &s;eeing the dialogue was not li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely immediately to end, di&s;mounted, and were introduced to Ro&s;alie; the one as the nephew of Mrs. Vyvian, Mr. Montalbert, who, after a long re&s;idence abroad, was come to Eng|land for a few months only, on a vi&s;it to the Vy|vian family: the other as the Count de Torriani, an Italian nobleman, to whom al&s;o the Vyvians were, though more di&s;tantly, related. So many and &s;o rapid were the que&s;tions that Mr. Charles Vyvian now had to make, that he wholly engro&s;&s;|ed the conver&s;ation: And as they &s;lowly walked down the green avenue before them, he &s;eemed totally to have forgotten whither he was going, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that he had any other bu&s;ine&s;s in the world
<PB N="32" REF="029524_0034_0FE1D38F27D93F88">
than to conver&s;e with Ro&s;alie as long as he could. It was now, however, &s;o nearly dark, that &s;he thought it would be wrong to proceed any far|ther.&mdash;"I mu&s;t wi&s;h you a good night," &s;aid &s;he, "and make the be&s;t of my way through the wood home."</P>
<P>"Indeed, but you mu&s;t not think of returning by your&s;elf," an&s;wered Vyvian.&mdash;"Harry," ad|ded he, &s;peaking to Montalbert "let us go home with Mi&s;s Le&s;&s;ington.&mdash;Shall we not, Harry?"</P>
<P>Harry an&s;wered, "With great plea&s;ure:" and the oppo&s;ition of Ro&s;alie was in vain.</P>
<P>"But we need not go down this way, &s;urely," &s;aid Vyvian; "we may go along the path I &s;aw you in, and &s;o through your father's orchard or garden, or &s;omething&mdash;I am &s;ure I remember &s;uch a way."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie an&s;wered, that it was certainly a much &s;horter road, but it was only a foot-path, and that there was a &s;tile to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>"Never mind the &s;tile," cried the young man, "we will leap our hor&s;es over."</P>
<P>He then led the way into the path, which only allowed two per&s;ons to walk abrea&s;t. Mr. Montalbert and the Count de Torriani followed; the former murmuring loudly again&s;t Vyvian's monopoly, and the narrowne&s;s of the path.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie expected to have found her father and mother returned from their walk, and in no very plea&s;ant humour, becau&s;e &s;he had left them&punc; but, on entering the hou&s;e through the garden, the noi&s;e &s;he heard in her father's book-room convinced her that the party whom &s;he &s;o earne&s;t|ly

wi&s;hed to avoid were not gone, but were, on the contrary, &s;et in to drinking; an alteration of plan which did not at all &s;urpri&s;e her, when Mr. Blagham and Mr. Hugh&s;on were of the party.</P>
<P>Young Vyvian, who&s;e &s;ole meaning was to &s;ee her &s;afe, was however now compelled in common civility to inquire for her mother and her &s;i&s;ters. Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, amazed at his &s;ud|den appearance, received him with a mixture of civility and confu&s;ion, for which Ro&s;alie knew not how to account. Mingled with this extraor|dinary expre&s;&s;ion, there was al&s;o &s;ome anger towards her, and &s;omething that &s;eemed like a di&s;po&s;ition to reproach her for having introduced vi&s;itors &s;o unexpected.</P>
<P>Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington expre&s;&s;ing her &s;urprize at &s;ee|ing him, when &s;he imagined he was at Chelten|ham, or in the North with the re&s;t of the family, he &s;aid, "The Count de Torriani and my cou&s;in Harry, having an inclination to &s;ee Holmwood, we agreed to make a tour round the Coa&s;t, to pa&s;s about ten days at Brighthelm&s;tone, and to make Holmwood in our way back.

"I am at this moment more di&s;po&s;ed than ever I was in my life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> make a longer abode at our old enchanted, but not enchanting ca&s;tle." Ro&s;alie did not &s;eem to think any an&s;wer nece&s;&s;ary to this: and Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington put on a look of great gravity and re&s;erve, but &s;aid nothing; and as at that mo|ment Mr. Montalbert did not &s;eem to find any thing to &s;ay, a profound &s;ilence en&s;ued for a minute, which was interrupted by the noi&s;y en|trance of Mr. Le&s;&s;ington and his friends. The former being appri&s;ed of the arrival of young Vy|vian, came to pay him his compliments: And the others were about to depart, or at lea&s;t to at|tempt it, though the whole party, without ex|cepting even the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, &s;eemed to have taken &s;uch large potations, that they ap|peared to be but little in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;en&s;es. Mr. Le&s;&s;ington, however, bu&s;tled up to young Vyvian, expre&s;&s;ing the greate&s;t delight in meet|ing him: And, amid&s;t the confu&s;ion, Mr. Mont|albert approached Ro&s;alie, to whom he had yet hardly had an opportunity of &s;peaking, though his eyes had declared how much he wi&s;hed it. "Do you not recollect me Mi&s;s Le&s;&s;ington?" &s;aid he, &s;peaking low&mdash;"I perfectly remember you, and the days I once pa&s;&s;ed with you at Holmwood made an impre&s;&s;ion on me that never will be effaced.

<P>"You do me too much honour," an&s;wered Ro&s;alie; "I was, indeed, very young&mdash;but (an involuntary &s;igh forced its way as &s;he &s;poke) tho&s;e were my days of unallowed felicity; it was my golden age, and every &s;cene has imprinted it&s;elf deeply on my memory. . .

<P>"Yes; and an Italian tutor. I recollect, but I dare &s;ay you do not, that then I could &s;peak very little Engli&s;h."</P>
<P>"Why, you can't &s;peak much now, Sir," in|terrupted a voice from behind Ro&s;alie's chair. "I &s;uppo&s;e by your accent, Sir, that you are a foreigner?"</P>
<P>"<HI>You</HI> &s;uppo&s;e, Sir," &s;aid Mr. Montalbert angrily; and pray, Sir, who are you?"</P>
<P>"Me, Sir!" an&s;wered the Rev. Mr. Hugh|&s;on&mdash;"Me, Sir!&mdash;Why, Sir, my name is Hugh&s;on."</P>
<P>"Well, Sir," &s;aid Montalbert haughtily, "whatever name you bear, I &s;uppo&s;e it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary for you to make a third in my conver&s;a|tion with this lady."

brave, and may, perhaps, render &s;ome brave men cowards. However, that might be, Hugh|&s;on attempted no reply: But &s;till, unwilling that this &s;tranger &s;hould engro&s;s the attention of Ro&s;a|lie, he determined at lea&s;t to keep as clo&s;e to her as he could, and therefore &s;quatted down in the window &s;eat near her, being in truth not very well able to &s;tand.</P>
<P>Montalbert, &s;hocked at his vulgarity and im|pertinence, and having no idea that much cere|mony was nece&s;&s;ary towards a man, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a little, dirty, drunken curate, &s;poke in a &s;till lower tone to Ro&s;alie, and what was yet more mortifying, he &s;poke in Italian, while, with open mouth and watery eyes, her unfortunate admirer &s;at ga&s;ping and &s;taring be|hind her totally di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>Montalbert, as well as Ro&s;alie, had forgotten not only that he was in the room, but that any other per&s;ons were in it but them&s;elves. From an oblivion &s;o plea&s;ing, however, they were &s;oon rou&s;ed by Vyvian, who, di&s;engaging him&s;elf with great difficulty from the mandling civilities of Mr. Le&s;&s;ington, who was very drunk and very tedious, came ha&s;tily to Montalbert and told him they mu&s;t go. Vyvian then took Ro&s;alie's hand, and &s;ighing &s;aid, "Alas! how little I have &s;een of you, and <HI>that</HI> only by chance; can I not come to-morrow to take leave of you, Ro&s;alie? for you know I am going abroad again almo&s;t immediate|ly; and who knows when we &s;hall meet once more?

had by this time &s;idled up near her daughter, to whom &s;he did not allow time to reply, but with an air mo&s;t repul&s;ively grave and formal, &s;he &s;aid, "I am very &s;orry, Mr. Vyvian, it happens &s;o, as your time is &s;o &s;hort; but my daughter is par|ticularly engaged to-morrow. We are all par|ticularly engaged. It is extremely unfortunate indeed. Another time I hope we &s;hall be more lucky."</P>
<P>This rebuff &s;eemed particularly mortifying to Vyvian. He bowed coldly to the mother, and then, gently pre&s;&s;ing the hand of Ro&s;alie, which he &s;till held, he &s;aid in a whi&s;per, "I <HI>must</HI> &s;ee you again; where are you going to?"&mdash;"I do not know, indeed," an&s;wered Ro&s;alie, "for this is the fir&s;t I have heard of any engagement.

<P>Blagham was no longer in a &s;ituation to be trouble&s;ome: And Mi&s;s Catharine, &s;omewhat a&s;hamed of the figure he had made, had prevailed upon him to leave the room. . . . .

<P>"He is tall, indeed" replied her mother; "but you may &s;ee he is a mere boy. That young man, would you believe it, Mr. Hugh&s;on, is hardly &s;eventeen?

<P>"Pray, Ma'am," &s;aid Mi&s;s Catharine, "who is that other gentleman; I don't mean the fo|reign Count, but the other Engli&s;hman? He is a remarkable hand&s;ome man."</P>

<P>"Why, certainly," replied Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, "he can hardly be called an Engli&s;hman; for in the fir&s;t place, his mother was a foreign lady; and, though his father is an Engli&s;hman, he liv|ed chiefly abroad, and this gentleman has never been in England above half a year at a time, though they have a very fine &s;eat in the North of England, and a great fortune in the family."</P>
<P>"He &s;eems to be a very proud man," &s;aid Hugh&s;on. "I believe I have affronted h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> though I am &s;ure I don't know what I &s;aid."</P>

<P>Hugh&s;on who had no clear idea of what he <HI>had</HI> &s;aid, would have taken her hand, but &s;he &s;natch|ed it away, and ha&s;tened out of the room.

<P>Ro&s;alie, who&s;e &s;pirits were fatigued by the events of the afternoon, could not, however, compo&s;e her&s;elf to &s;leep. The &s;ight of Charles Vyvian had recalled all tho&s;e &s;cenes which &s;he had vainly been trying to forget, and to think of with le&s;s concern: And his manners, but &s;till more tho&s;e of his relation, Mr. Montalbert, formed &s;o decided a contra&s;t to tho&s;e of the per&s;ons with whom it was now her lot to be a&s;&s;ociated, that &s;he found &s;he &s;hould, by continually making the compari&s;on, be rendered more unea&s;y than ever. She &s;aw too, by her mother's manner, that &s;he would have yet to undergo &s;ome &s;evere reproofs for having brought Charles Vyvian and his two companions home with her; and though it was ea&s;y to account for their appearance, which it mu&s;t be known was merely in con&s;equence of ac|cidentally meeting her, yet &s;he knew that the circum&s;tance of her &s;o abruptly quitting company, in which it was her father's wi&s;h that &s;he &s;hould remain, would bring upon her reproaches that &s;he &s;hould not &s;oon or ea&s;ily appea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="029524_0042_0FE1D3A885E55E70">The next day verified her apprehen&s;ions. Her father ordered her to attend him in his &s;tudy at an early hour of the morning, as he was going out.

<P>Ro&s;alie remained &s;ilent.

<P>"Whither am I to go, Madam?" &s;aid Ro&s;a|lie in a dejected tone.</P>
<P>"To Chiche&s;ter," replied her mother dryly. . . "We dine with Mr. Blagham. His uncle is to be there with &s;ome other friends. Your &s;i&s;ter Catharine's &s;ettlement is to be &s;igned.

<P>ROSALIE was &s;oon ready to proceed on an expedition, from which &s;he found no pretence would excu&s;e her. She mounted her &s;i&s;ter Ca|tharine's poney with reluctance. Her father, mother, and Mi&s;s Le&s;&s;ington, were in the po&s;t chai&s;e. The other &s;i&s;ter was al&s;o on hor&s;eback; and it did not add much to Ro&s;alie's pro&s;pect for the day, that it was her &s;i&s;ter Maria who had been put out of humour the preceding evening by the unfortunate and unde&s;ired preference Hugh|&s;on had &s;hewn Ro&s;alie; and who, now &s;ullen and
<PB N="46" REF="029524_0048_0FE1D3B90AFF2B98">
pouting, endeavoured to &s;hew her &s;i&s;ter that &s;he had not forgotten the mortification.</P>
<P>They had a&s;cended and were riding along the hill; but the morning being hot and &s;ultry, Ro|&s;alie turned her hor&s;e towards its edge, where began a wood that &s;haded one &s;ide of it, and the a&s;h and beech afforded a temporary &s;kreen. Several roads wound up the hill from the villages below, and as Ro&s;alie was cro&s;&s;ing one of the&s;e, &s;he &s;aw Montalbert &s;uddenly appear, who, ap|proaching her with the common &s;alutation of the morning, rode along by her &s;ide without noticing the re&s;t of the party.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie con&s;cious that this would give great of|fence to her father and mother, and unwilling to increa&s;e the di&s;like they &s;eemed already to have taken to him from the little attention he &s;hewed to them the preceding evening, inquired if he would not &s;peak to them?</P>
<P>"Bye and bye," &s;aid he coldly; "but good God, is it never po&s;&s;ible to have a moment's con|ver&s;ation with you?&mdash;I have a great re&s;pect for Mr. and Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, becau&s;e they are &s;o nearly related to you: But you know I have not the plea&s;ure of being acquainted with them."</P>
<P>There was &s;omething of peculiar dejection in the manner of Montalbert as he &s;poke.</P>
<P>"You are not well?" &s;aid Ro&s;alie.</P>
<P>"Not very well," replied he; "but the hot weather of England never agrees with me. There is &s;omething &s;trangely oppre&s;&s;ive in it. I don't know whether it is that which has affected poor Charles; but, I a&s;&s;ure you, he is &s;eriou&s;ly

<P>"I am very &s;orry," &s;aid Ro&s;alie with quick|ne&s;s, "it will &s;o di&s;tre&s;s my dear Mrs. Vyvian!&mdash; Has he &s;ent for any advice?"</P>

"Has Mr. Vyvian &s;ent for Mr. Harri&s;on, the apothecary?"</P>
<P>"I believe Mr. Hayward intended it," replied Montalbert; "for the poor old man was frighten|ed out of his wits. Charles, however, oppo&s;ed it. Perhaps it will be nothing. But you know that his mother has nur&s;ed him to death; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Hayward is as timid as an old woman about him."</P>
<P>"I am very unea&s;y," &s;aid Ro&s;alie, pau&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> moment. "I think I had better tell my mother&punc; She will &s;urely &s;ee Mr. Vyvian, as &s;he knows how very wretched her friend would be &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her &s;on b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l at a di&s;tance from her."

<P>"Well?"&mdash;&s;aid Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington &s;harply, as the chai&s;e &s;topped&mdash;"and what now?"</P>
<P>"Dear Madam," an&s;wered Ro&s;alie in vi&s;ible con&s;ternation, "here is Mr. Montalbert, whom I have met by accident, who tells me that Mr. Charles Vyvian is taken very ill!"</P>

<P>"I don't &s;ee what <HI>we</HI> can do, my dear," &s;aid Mr. Le&s;&s;ington. "Probably Mr. Hayward has taken proper care of the young gentleman.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e," added he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Ro&s;alie, "&s;ince Mr. Montalbert came hither by <HI>accident,</HI> that Mr. Charles has not &s;ent any me&s;&s;age ex|pre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h to &s;ee your mother?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir," an&s;wered Ro&s;alie.</P>

repeatedly, as if enquiring with angry counten|ance, whether Montalbert had left her, which &s;he now entreated him to do. He &s;ighed deeply, and &s;aid, in a mournful tone, "And &s;o you are going to that town, and do not return perhaps the&s;e two or three days, and before that time we &s;hall have left the country, and I &s;hall &s;ee you no more!"</P>
<P>This idea, which &s;eemed &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to him, was by no means the plea&s;ante&s;t that could be pre&s;ented to the imagination of Ro&s;alie.

But &s;he attempted to &s;mile, and to an|&s;wer cheerfully, "O yes&mdash;I am per&s;uaded we &s;hall meet again."&mdash;"But when? or where?" cried Montalbert, fixing his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> earne&s;tly on her face. "Alas! Mi&s;s Le&s;&s;ington, <HI>I</HI> &s;hall &s;oon leave England; and this, perhaps, is the la&s;t time we &s;hall meet!"</P>
<P>"I &s;hould be <HI>so</HI> &s;orry to believe that," an|&s;wered &s;he, he&s;itating and blu&s;hing, "that I will not &s;tay to hear it repeated. . . . .

<P>Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ington, now putting his head once more out of the window, waved his hand impa|tiently for his daughter to keep up with them. Ro&s;alie under&s;tood the &s;ignal but too well; and though relu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntly, put her hor&s;e in a gallop, while Montalbert checked his, more reluctantly &s;till.

in the &s;ame place, following with his eyes the object from which he was &s;o unwilling to part, till a wood, into which the road turned, concealed her from his &s;ight.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie, in the mean time, proceeded with a heavier heart than &s;he knew how to account for. The illne&s;s of Charles Vyvian, which alarmed her not only on his own account, but on that of his mother, and the certainty that &s;he &s;hould be compelled to pa&s;s two or three days among per|&s;ons &s;o extremely di&s;agreeable to her, were in|deed rea&s;ons enough for chagrin; but the con|cern &s;he felt was &s;omething deeper than belonged to either of the&s;e. That &s;he had &s;een Montalbert for the la&s;t time, &s;he could not think of without the mo&s;t acute unea&s;ine&s;s: And &s;o much did that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dea dwell on her mind, that &s;he arrived at the end of her journey hardly knowing how &s;he got t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere: Nor was &s;he rou&s;ed from the indulgence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e painful reflections, till the trouble&s;ome a&s;&s;iduities of Hugh&s;on re&s;tored her to her&s;elf, by impo&s;ing on he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he nece&s;&s;ity of repre&s;&s;ing his im|pertinence; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he did, however with an a&s;perity &s;o unu&s;ual to her, that her mother &s;e|verely reproved her the moment they were alone.

<P>"Gracious Heaven!" exclaimed Ro&s;alie, as &s;oon as her mother left her, "I am thus to be dre&s;&s;ed up, and offered like an animal to &s;ale; and my mother &s;eems to think it a matter of cour&s;e. . . . . .

<P>It was not, however, in the eyes of Hugh&s;on only that &s;he appeared the faire&s;t of the rural nymphs from 'under the hills.'

<P>Before &s;he returned, the card tables were ad|ju&s;ted: And Mr. and Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, who dear|ly loved a game at whi&s;t, were &s;ettled with Blag|ham, who really had, and Hugh&s;on who fan|cied he had, great &s;kill in the game.

<P>Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington would have reproved her younge&s;t daughter for having thus neglected her admonitions; but, when &s;he &s;aw the three to|gether, &s;he could not help being &s;en&s;ible that Ro|&s;alie looked like a girl of fa&s;hion, while Catharine and Maria had the appearance of people dre&s;&s;ed for the performance of &s;trolling plays, with all the finery the property man could furni&s;h. Without any remon&s;trance, therefore, &s;he was &s;uffered to go with the re&s;t: But not &s;o ea&s;ily did &s;he e&s;cape from the renewed importunities of Mr. Hugh&s;on to dance with him, who having engaged her father to interfere in his favour, &s;he received &s;o peremptory an order to accept him, accompanied by looks &s;o angry and menacing, that &s;he was compelled, though with extreme reluctance, to &s;ubmit. Her &s;i&s;ter, on the point of being marri|ed, was of cour&s;e taken out by her lover: But by &s;ome mortifying fatality Mi&s;s Maria was una&s;ked; and the fir&s;t dance was nearly ended, when, to the extreme &s;urprize of Ro&s;alie, who with her &s;kipping partner was arrived at the bottom, &s;he &s;aw, (almo&s;t doubting the information of her eyes) her &s;i&s;ter Maria &s;tanding up with Montalbert&punc;</P>

The figure of the dance now obliged them to &s;eparate; but in a few mo|ments declining to go down the dance, which was &s;oon after over, Montalbert &s;eated him&s;elf by her, taking without any &s;cruple the place of her partner, whom &s;he &s;ent away for &s;ome negus. "You inquire after my friend," &s;aid Montalbert, "with an intere&s;t &s;o tender, that, however I may envy his happine&s;s in exciting that intere&s;t, it be|comes me to &s;atisfy your inquiries: Yet you might, perhaps, obtain more &s;atisfactory infor|mation from him&s;elf."</P>
<P>"From him&s;elf!" cried Ro&s;alie eagerly; "is he here then?"</P>
<P>"Alas!" an&s;wered Montalbert, again deeply &s;ighing, "he &s;eems in&s;en&s;ible of the good fortune which <HI>I</HI> would purcha&s;e with worlds, if I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed them, for there he is conver&s;ing with L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &mdash;, and Lady Anne &mdash;, at the other en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the room.

<P>"I am very glad, however," &s;aid &s;he, affect|ing not to under&s;tand this, "I am extremely glad to find Mr. Vyvian &s;o much recovered; I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> alarmed at his threatened illne&s;s on account of his mother."</P>

<P>"Yes; Sir," &s;aid Ro&s;alie gravely, "certainly on account of his mother."</P>
<P>At this moment two per&s;ons of very different de&s;cription approached them. . . . Hugh&s;on came &s;mirking and prancing with a gla&s;s of negus, and began telling how he had mixed it after a manner peculiar to him&s;elf; but &s;eeing that Ro&s;alie gave no attention to him, and that Montalbert mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no offer to re&s;ign the place he had u&s;urped, he re|mained looking even le&s;s wi&s;e than ordinary, till his di&s;may was increa&s;ed by the appearance of Vyvian, who, putting him on one &s;ide with very little ceremony, entered into conver&s;ation with Ro&s;alie, who expre&s;&s;ed as warmly as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e felt it, the plea&s;ure his recovery gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he loved Charles Vyvian exactly as &s;he loved her brothers.

of impropriety, &s;he ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and walked with him to the other end of the room, Montalbert taking his place in &s;ilence on the other &s;ide; while the luckle&s;s Hugh&s;on drank up him&s;elf what he had fetched for his part|ner, and then went with a rueful countenance to find at the &s;ideboard below &s;omething more pow|erful to di&s;&s;ipate the chagrin he felt, as well as the aukward &s;en&s;ations of con&s;cious inferiority. Ro&s;alie in the mean time, not thinking about him, was inquiring of Charles Vyvian why he prolonged his &s;tay in the country, when he was well enough to go? "I thought," &s;aid &s;he, "I thought you told me, that Mrs. Vyvian did not even know of your intentions of being at Holm|wood. If &s;he &s;hould hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of your remaining there on account of illne&s;s, 'tis &s;o far from advice, I cannot imagine why you &s;tay."</P>
<P>"What would you think," replied he in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whi&s;per, as if he was &s;olicitous that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> might not hear him&mdash;"what would you think Ro&s;alie, if I were to tell you, that I went thither in the hope of &s;eeing you; that I linger here for no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e I cannot prevail up|on my&s;elf to quit the country where you are?"</P>

She was proceeding, though &s;he he&s;itated, blu&s;hed, and was evidently di&s;concert|ed, when &s;he was interrupted by her mother, who coming towards her, &s;aid, with more ap|pearance of ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r than &s;he had ever yet &s;hewn,

"Why is it, Ro&s;e, that you thus quit Mr. Hugh|&s;on I am a&s;toni&s;hed at your rudene&s;s, child, and <HI>must insist</HI> upon having no more of &s;uch behavi|our." Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington then &s;eized her hand, and giving it into that of Hugh&s;on, &s;aid, with a &s;ort of convul&s;ive laugh, "Here, Sir&mdash;I am &s;ure Ro&s;e will be happy&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;to go down the dance with you.

<P>Hugh&s;on then, endeavouring to &s;mile and &s;mirk in order to conceal the extreme vexation he felt, advanced to take her hand; but, from &s;ome unu&s;ual courage which at that moment &s;he felt, &s;ome &s;udden impul&s;e for which &s;he could hardly account, and which &s;he afterwards thought blameable, &s;he &s;natched away the hand Hugh&s;on would have taken, and telling him di&s;dainfully that &s;he did not know that &s;he &s;hould dance any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore, &s;he turned to the &s;eat &s;he had before occu|pied, whither Vyvian, wholly regardle&s;s of the evident anger of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, followed her&punc;</P>
<P>Hugh&s;on, &s;welling with rage and re&s;entment, which he had, however, no means of &s;atisfying, now &s;eemed to give up the point in ab&s;olute de&s;|pair. But, accu&s;tomed as he had been to fancy that &s;o clever a little fellow, with his fortune and expectations, might have his choice among the young women of a whole county, he could not repre&s;s the mortification he felt. The plan that Montalbert had adopted of dancing with Maria Le&s;&s;ington, in order to obtain the opportunity of conver&s;ing with her &s;i&s;ter, had been &s;o far from an&s;wering, that it had entirely ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed his pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e.

<P>Montalbert, however, who had &s;een too much of the world to be ea&s;ily diverted from his de&s;ign, made a fal&s;e &s;tep as he was going down the dance that was now begun, and prote&s;ting he had hurt him&s;elf &s;o as to make his going on impo&s;&s;ible, was limping to a &s;eat; but &s;eizing on poor Hugh|&s;on in his way, he cried, "My good Sir, I per|ceive your fair partner declines dancing a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more; I am, mo&s;t unfortunately for my&s;elf, di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+abled&mdash;It will be happy for you; for you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have the plea&s;ure of taking one lovely &s;i&s;ter in&s;tead of the other."</P>

<P>Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington had retired to cards after her la&s;t &s;harp remon&s;trances to her daughter; and the eagerne&s;s with which &s;he always pur&s;ued her game, kept her in another room for &s;ome time. At length, however, &s;he was either put out of the game by rotation, or &s;ome evil-di&s;po&s;ed per|&s;ons had whi&s;pered to her what was pa&s;&s;ing among the dancers; for about an hour and an half after her la&s;t rebuke, &s;he returned to the ball-room, and, in a voice and manner more angry than be|fore, told Ro&s;alie that &s;he was going home, and &s;hould take her thither at the &s;ame time.

But why her mother &s;hould make her conver&s;ation with Charles Vyvian &s;o great a crime, &s;he could not imagine, &s;ince in fact &s;he had &s;hewn a much greater di&s;po&s;ition to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver&s;e with his cou&s;in than with him, and was perfectly con&s;cious that &s;he gave him no other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence than what aro&s;e from the long intimacy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> being &s;o much together in childhood, had created between them. . . . .

Montal|bert therefore loved her. An idea &s;o &s;oothing acquired new power to charm her in proportion as &s;he reflected on all he had &s;aid, and the man|ner in which he &s;aid it. How fortunate would be her de&s;tiny, &s;hould &s;he become the wife of &s;uch a man, and how was it po&s;&s;ible that her mother, who mu&s;t &s;ee the marked preference he gave her, could he&s;itate a moment between him and &s;uch a man as Hugh&s;on!

<P>"My &s;i&s;ter Ro&s;e's great and fine friends&punc;" an&s;wered Maria, "Mr. Vyvian and Mr.&mdash; I forget his name, that very fine&s;t of all fine men."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie who had &s;een them as well as her &s;i&s;ter, could not help blu&s;hing. Montalbert had looked earne&s;tly in as he pa&s;&s;ed, and checked his hor&s;e a moment when he perceived he had caught her eye.</P>
<P>"I hope," &s;aid Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington au&s;terely, "that Mr. Vyvian is returning immediately to his mother, who is extremely ill, who knows no|thing of his being here, and who would be ex|tremely unhappy were &s;he to be informed of it.

<P>The other young ladies had a great deal to do in the town; for Mi&s;s Catharine was now to be married in three days. Mantua-makers and mil|liners were therefore to be hurried; and, as &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over, they went out together for that purpo&s;e, attended by Blagham and Hugh&s;on, while Ro&s;alie remained where &s;he was, having no ambition to accompany them. Her prepara|tions for her &s;i&s;ter's wedding were confined, (as it was intended that Maria only &s;hould accompa|ny the bride,) and about the&s;e &s;he was by no means &s;olicitous.</P>
<P>Di&s;agreeable and unea&s;y to her as the remon|&s;trances and reproaches were that &s;he was &s;till obliged to hear, &s;he flattered her&s;elf that one good effect would ari&s;e from the circum&s;tances of the preceding evening&mdash;that Hugh&s;on, convinced of its inefficacy, would carry his &s;uit no farther, and that his pride would prevent her being teazed with addre&s;&s;es, which her &s;i&s;ter &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to receive favourably.</P>
<P>But in this hope &s;he was di&s;ppointed. The admiration Ro&s;alie had &s;o univer&s;ally excited, while her &s;i&s;ter had been hardly noticed, the whi&s;pers of approbation that he had heard from

the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable &s;et in the room, for who&s;e opinion the whole country around had the mo&s;t implicit deference, as well as the impre&s;&s;ion &s;he &s;eemed to have made on Vyvian and Montalbert, were altogether circum&s;tances &s;o far from deter|ring Hugh&s;on from pur&s;uing her, that they &s;erv|ed only to inflame his ambition: And, though he affected to direct his attention towards Mi&s;s Ma|ria, for a while, in hopes of piquing Ro&s;alie, he &s;oon renewed tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of affection and prote&s;tations of unwearied per&s;everance, from which Ro&s;alie fore&s;aw &s;o much per&s;ecution and trouble.</P>
<P>As Hugh&s;on was to perform the marriage cere|mony between his friend Blagham and Mi&s;s Kitty Le&s;&s;ington, he went back with the family; and by his trouble&s;ome a&s;&s;iduities, and ridiculous at|tempts at gaiety and wit, deprived her of the &s;atis|faction &s;he would have derived from having left a place &s;o very di&s;agreeable to her as the provin|cial town where they had pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t three days. . . . .

known to have private meetings with any one&mdash; but what <HI>meetings</HI> can I have?&mdash;Is not Mr. Mon|talbert immediately going back to Italy: And is there any probability of my ever &s;eeing him again?&mdash;Ah! no."&mdash;The argument concluded with a deep &s;igh: But it had not helped to deter|mine her. From an almo&s;t intuitive &s;en&s;e of pro|priety, for &s;he had received but little in&s;truction on &s;uch matters, &s;he was con&s;cious that &s;he ought not to go out with a view of meeting Mon|talbert. Yet to think that &s;he had &s;een him for the la&s;t time, to let him go with impre&s;&s;ions of her having a predilection in favour of &s;uch a man as Hugh&s;on, of her being happy among &s;uch &s;oci|ety as &s;he was condemned to, it was impo&s;&s;ible to determine on. Sleep the en&s;uing night was driven from the pillow of Ro&s;alie by the&s;e debates; but it was at this &s;ea&s;on, long before day appear|ed with its fir&s;t dawn, however, &s;he left her bed; for it would very &s;oon be nece&s;&s;ary to determine whether &s;he would venture to commit &s;uch an impropriety as meeting Montalbert, or &s;uffer him to depart under the impre&s;&s;ions he would carry with him, if &s;he &s;aw him no more.</P>
<P>His dejection when he &s;poke of immediately leaving England, his re&s;pectful manners, the warm and lively affection he &s;eemed to have for her, the advantageous light in which his honour|able addre&s;&s;es appeared to her, all contributed to di&s;po&s;e her to meet him. Again&s;t it there was only that internal &s;en&s;e of prudence, (which like the voice of con&s;cience, could not be entirely &s;tifled,) and the fear of offending her mother.
<PB N="71" REF="029524_0073_0FE1D40767FED4A0">
Yet why &s;hould her mother be offended?&mdash;Con|&s;idered in every way whether as to fortune&punc; rank of life, family, or pro&s;pects, there could, &s;he thought, be no compari&s;on between Montalbert and Hugh&s;on; and if to have her married well was the wi&s;h of her parents, why &s;hould they be angry at her not declining an acquaintance which &s;eemed likely to end in an e&s;tabli&s;hment above their hopes. There was &s;ome truth, but more &s;ophi&s;try, in the arguments &s;he u&s;ed with her&s;elf to conquer her remaining apprehen&s;ions; when, having determined to venture, &s;ince it could be but for once, &s;he left the hou&s;e, and trembling and looking behind her at every &s;tep, ha&s;tened through the heavy dews and grey fogs of a late October morning to the cop&s;e where &s;he had fir&s;t unexpectedly met Vyvian and Montalbert, and where he had told her he &s;hould be very early on this morning, the la&s;t of his &s;tay in the country, in hopes of her giving him an opportunity of ta|king a long leave of her.</P>

<P>It was not till &s;he retired to dre&s;s for dinner that &s;he was at liberty to reflect on all that had pa&s;&s;ed with Montalbert.

<P>Soon dre&s;&s;ed for the day, &s;he &s;at in the window of her bed chamber, pen&s;ively looking towards the quarter where Holmwood Hou&s;e was &s;ituated, though &s;he could not di&s;tingui&s;h it. "He is gone!" &s;aid &s;he. "Already he is on his way to London; in a few days after he arrives there he will leave it&mdash;will leave England&mdash;the &s;ea will be between us!" She took out the picture he had given her, and, for the third time &s;ince it had been in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, fixed her eyes earne&s;tly upon it. The candour and integrity of the coun|tenance &s;truck her particularly. "Never," &s;ighed &s;he, "can the heart that belongs to the&s;e features be otherwi&s;e than generous, tender, and &s;incere." She was thus feeding the infant pa&s;&s;ion which had taken entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, and was lo&s;t in thought, holding the picture &s;till in her hand, when her elder brother opened the door. "Are you dre&s;&s;ed Ro&s;alie?" &s;aid he, "and may I come in?"&mdash;"O yes! yes! brother," an&s;wer|ed &s;he, hurrying the picture into her pocket, "pray come in."</P>
<P>"I have a great deal to &s;ay to you, my dear Ro&s;e," &s;aid he. "Come, give me a place in the window by you. You are very much impro|ved, my love, &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t; I don't won|der at the havoc you make; but my mother complains of you, Ro&s;e."</P>
<P>"On what account, my brother? I am &s;ure I never intentionally offended my mother."</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="029524_0081_0FE1D41E59631988">"But &s;he tells me that you have now an op|portunity of marrying extremely well; but that from &s;ome unaccountable perver&s;ene&s;s, or unrea|&s;onable prejudice, or perhaps," added he, fixing his eyes earne&s;tly on hers, "perhaps through &s;ome unhappy predilection, you drive from you, with contempt and di&s;dain, a man every way unexceptionable."</P>
<P>"You have &s;een him, brother," an&s;wered Ro|&s;alie, "and can tell whether you think him all that my mother has repre&s;ented."</P>
<P>"I have only &s;een him for a moment, and have hardly exchanged ten words with him. His per&s;on is neither good nor bad; but &s;urely my &s;i&s;ter has too much &s;en&s;e to refu&s;e a man mere|ly becau&s;e he is not an Adonis."</P>
<P>"But indeed, brother, it is not that. Mr. Hugh&s;on is a man, whom it is impo&s;&s;ible I can ever like.

<P>"All that is very well," &s;aid William Le&s;&s;ing|ton; "but tell me, Ro&s;alie, what do you &s;ay as to this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of another, of which my mother accu&s;es you?"</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="029524_0082_0FE1D424B7EA6C30">"I can &s;ay nothing," replied &s;he, "becau&s;e I &mdash;becau&s;e I know that&mdash;indeed I do not know who &s;he means."</P>
<P>"Is there no &s;uch predilection exi&s;ting then, Ro&s;alie?"</P>
<P>"Not for the per&s;on my mother thinks of," an&s;wered &s;he, colouring &s;till higher.</P>
<P>"You allow there is for &s;ome other then?"</P>
<P>"Not at all. I am &s;ure I did not &s;ay any thing like that; but if there were, why, my dear brother, &s;hould it of nece&s;&s;ity be in favour of a per&s;on who would di&s;grace my family?"</P>
<P>"There may be very improper attachments, Ro&s;alie," replied he very gravely, "which may not be di&s;graceful in the u&s;ual acceptation of the word: As, for example, if a young woman &s;hould be flattered into a partiality for a <HI>boy</HI> of a <HI>different</HI> religion, and in who&s;e power it could ne|ver be to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulfil any promi&s;es which a childi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion might induce him to make." The coun|tenance of Ro&s;alie changed to a deeper &s;carlet. "I &s;ee how it is, my &s;i&s;ter," added he, "and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill not di&s;tre&s;s you any farther; but I tru&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our own &s;weetne&s;s and candour to give me an op|portunity of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this matter when we are both more at lei&s;ure. . . . . .

<P>"Before you go, my dear William," cried Ro&s;alie, recovering her&s;elf a little, "let me a&s;&s;ure you, that my mother has no grounds whatever for her &s;u&s;picions, but becau&s;e Mr. Charles Vy|vian has appeared particularly plea&s;ed at our m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t|ing; and what was more natural?

<P>"And is <HI>that</HI> all, Ro&s;alie?"</P>
<P>"That is all, upon my honour, replied &s;he, in regard of Mr. Vyvian."</P>
<P>Young Le&s;&s;ington, who did not know Montal|bert even by name, appeared &s;atisfied, and they went down together; when, from the beginning of the dinner, conver&s;ation, and quantity of wine which Hugh&s;on very &s;oon &s;wallowed Ro&s;alie flat|tered her&s;elf that long before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he even|ing he would do or &s;ay &s;ometh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would thoroughly di&s;gu&s;t her elder bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and, by convincing him that &s;he was right in refu&s;ing him, procure for her a defence again&s;t the irk&s;ome im|portunity of his future addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In this &s;he was not mi&s;taken.

<P><PB N="82" REF="029524_0084_0FE1D4289EF8C5A0">Dinner was hardly over, and the bottle going as bri&s;kly about as it could do before the ladies retired, when Abraham came &s;tumbling into the room, and muttered &s;omething which nobody un|der&s;tood: and, before there was time for enqui|ry, Mr. Charles Vyvian and Mr. Montalbert en|tered, to the di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;ome of the company, and to the a&s;toni&s;hment of Ro&s;alie, who, on meeting her brother's eyes, looked &s;o confu&s;ed, that all the &s;u&s;picions Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington had hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to him in the morning &s;eemed to be confirmed.

<P>The repul&s;ive gravity with which Mrs. Le&s;&s;|ington an&s;wered him, was but ill &s;econded by the

increa&s;ing confu&s;ion of her daughter, who he&s;itat|ed, blu&s;hed, and &s;tammered out a few incoherent words; &s;ymptoms which did not e&s;cape her bro|ther, who narrowly watched her, and who &s;ailed not to impute it all to a very different motive from the real one.</P>
<P>Montalbert, in the mean time, was on thorns. Surrounded as &s;he was, there was no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;peaking to her: and he could not bear to leave her without having fixed on &s;ome means by which they might hear from each other. He recollected that none of her family under&s;tood Italian: he looked round to &s;ee if it was likely any one in the room did, and being &s;oon convinced he had no|thing to apprehend, unle&s;s it was from the Oxford man, and even with him he thought the chances were much in his favour, he told Ro&s;alie, addre&s;|&s;ing her with great gravity, that &s;inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, he had rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted the words of the Italian &s;ong &s;he had mentioned, and that, if &s;he would favour him with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en and ink in the next room, he would write them out.</P>
<P>At this moment the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ceiving a hint from her hu&s;band to depart, &s;aid as &s;he ro&s;e from the table, "we will &s;end you one down &s;ir."&mdash;"O no!" replied he, "rather let me write it, dear Madam, in your apartment; and, Vyvian, as we mu&s;t immediately return home, we will now wi&s;h Mr. Le&s;&s;ington and his friends good night." This &s;hort ceremony pa&s;&s;ed with great formality on all &s;ides: and Vyvian and Mon|talbert followed the woman of the family into an|other room, the latter &s;at him&s;elf down with great

&s;olemnity to write out his &s;ong, which having done in the plaine&s;t Italian he could imagine, but written as if it was in mea&s;ure, he gave it to Ro&s;a|lie; and Vyvian, who had been talking earne&s;tly to her the whole time, reluctantly took his leave al&s;o, and they both departed.</P>
<P>They were hardly out of the room before Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, who&s;e anger and &s;u&s;picions were rou&s;|ed anew, demanded to &s;ee the paper Montalbert had given her. Ro&s;alie, not without fear and trembling, delivered it to her. She looked at it a moment; and believing from the manner in which it was written it was really a &s;ong, gave it her back again, not without evident marks of di&s;plea&s;ure, and many hints of her re&s;olution to inform Mrs. Vyvian where her &s;on was, and of the impropriety of his conduct, if he did not leave th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntry the next day. Of all this, as Ro&s;alie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not obliged to think it addre&s;&s;ed to her, &s;he took no notice.</P>
<P>The next day the wedding of her &s;econd &s;i&s;ter and Mr. Blagham was celebrated. The party were more noi&s;y and di&s;agreeable than is even u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions. Hugh&s;on was the mo&s;t drunk, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t impertinent; and never was an hour &s;o welcome to Ro&s;alie as that which took them all away, by the favour of a full moon, and left her alone with her mother.</P>
<P>Till now the tumult, with which &s;he had been &s;urrounded, had not allowed her a moment, ex|cept tho&s;e allotted to repo&s;e, to indulge reflections on what had pa&s;&s;ed. The &s;ullen calm that &s;uc|ceeded was calculated to re&s;tore her di&s;&s;ipated
<PB N="85" REF="029524_0087_0FE1BAAB3AA8EFF0">
and bewildered thoughts. Her mother, bu&s;ied in arranging her hou&s;e, left her to her&s;elf. Her father had accompanied the bride and bridegroom to their hou&s;e, and was afterwards to go on a tour with them into the ea&s;tern part of the coun|ty. It was at once a matter of plea&s;ure and &s;ur|pri&s;e to Ro&s;alie, that he had never once propo&s;ed her being of the party: and &s;he remarked that he now appeared much le&s;s anxious than her mother to promote with her the &s;uit of Mr. Hugh&s;on; it &s;eemed as if he would have been as well contented that his daughter Maria &s;hould en&s;ure this important conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Le&s;&s;ington was one of tho&s;e men who have ju&s;t as much under&s;tanding as enables them to fill, with tolerable decency, their part on the theatre of the world. He loved the conveniences of life, and indulged rather too much in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea&s;ures of the table. His le&s;s fortunate acquaintances (a race of people to whom he was not particular|ly attached) knew that Mr. Le&s;&s;ington was not a man to whom the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed could apply with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y hope of receiving any thing but good a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tho&s;e who were more fortunate had for the mo&s;t part a very good opinion of Mr. Le&s;&s;ington. If he was exact and &s;omewhat &s;trict in exacting his dues, he was al&s;o very regular in the duties of his office; and if he did not feel much for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor, he never offended, as &s;ome country curates have done, the ears of the rich, by complaints which tho&s;e who <HI>overlook</HI> the labourers in the vineyard are always &s;o unwilling to hear.

re&s;pectably: and every body concluded he had &s;ome private fortune, be&s;ides the two or three thou&s;and pounds he was known to have received with his wife. He kept a po&s;t-chai&s;e; not, in|deed, a very &s;uperb and fa&s;hionable equipage, but very well for that country. His cart hor&s;es drew it, but they were &s;leek and well trimmed: and Abraham tru&s;&s;ed up in a tight blue jacket, and his broad cheeks &s;et off by a jockey cap, made a very re&s;pectable appearance as conductor of a vehicle which gave no incon&s;iderable degree of con&s;equence to its owners in a country thinly inhabited by gentlemen. Mr. Le&s;&s;ington was the mo&s;t punctual man imaginable at all meetings of the clergy, where he did equal honour to the &s;ublunary good things that were to be eaten, and the &s;piritual good things that were to be li&s;tened to.

Mr. Blagham had not been entirely without con|&s;iderations of this &s;ort, when he married a wife with no other portion than her wedding clothes. But Mr. Le&s;&s;ington had promi&s;ed her &s;omething hand&s;ome at his death: and there was no doubt in the mind of the lawyer of his ability to fulfil his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington and Ro&s;alie had now been at home alone three days. The former had &s;ettled her hou&s;e, and was quietly enjoying the order &s;he had re&s;tored after all the bu&s;tle they had lately been in; while Ro&s;alie, with mingled emo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ons of fear, anxiety, and doubt, waited for intelli|gence from Montalbert.</P>
<P>It was in the evening of the third day, that as &s;he was walking in a &s;ort of court, that was before the hou&s;e next a road, an hor&s;eman &s;topped, and inquired if this was not the par&s;onage? On Ro&s;a|lie's an&s;wering in the affirmative, he produced a letter, which he &s;aid he had been &s;ent with from Lewes.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="029524_0090_0FE1D43D0B4698C0">The predominant idea in the head of Ro&s;alie being Montalbert, &s;he trembled like a leaf when the man gave her the letter, and, without con&s;i|dering whether it was likely her lover &s;hould &s;end it thus openly, or how it &s;hould come from Lewes, &s;he ha&s;tened breathle&s;s into the hou&s;e to obtain a light to read it by, for it was now nearly dark.

<P>Though nothing was more likely than &s;uch an event, from the form and manner of life of her hu&s;band, it had never once occurred to her as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary to relate all that pa&s;&s;ed in the Le&s;&s;ington family, till the period when all its members were a&s;&s;embled to hear the will read. It was then found that he had given his widow, for her life, a third of all he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which amounted in the whole to about eight thou&s;and pounds, and divided the re&s;t among his children, to each of whom he allotted a certain portion to be paid at a certain time, except to Ro&s;alie, who&s;e name was not even mentioned in the will.</P>

The behaviour of her elder brother, however, would have given her comfort, could &s;he have conquered the pain|ful idea, that her father had thrown her off as a &s;tranger to his blood. As &s;oon as the funeral was over, her brother William took occa&s;ion to talk to her alone. "Be not &s;o dejected, my dear Ro&s;alie," &s;aid he; "unpromi&s;ing as your pro|&s;pects appear, you have at lea&s;t the con&s;olation of knowing that you have always a friend in me, who will never for&s;ake you."</P>

that you could have given him the lea&s;t offence. I rather think that this &s;trange circum&s;tance aro&s;e from the opinion he entertained, that Mrs. Vyvi|an would provide for you."</P>
<P>"How could my father think that," &s;aid Ro&s;a|lie, "when he mu&s;t have known that Mrs. Vyvi|an, notwith&s;tanding the large fortune &s;he brought, has not even the power to hire or di&s;charge a &s;er|vant, and is hardly allowed enough yearly to ap|pear as her rank requires, lea&s;t, as her cro&s;s tyrant of an hu&s;band &s;ays, &s;he &s;hould &s;quander his for|tune on begging friars and mummers of her own religion? She had, indeed, a &s;ettlement of her own: but I heard him reproach her with having di&s;po&s;ed of it in &s;ome &s;uch way: but, however that may be, my father mu&s;t have known that it was not in her power to do any thing for me. Of late, too, he mu&s;t have thought that it was not her wi&s;h, for &s;he has appeared almo&s;t entirely to have forgotten me."</P>
<P>"There is, however, no other way of account|ing for the circum&s;tance: and the more I reflect on it, the more I am per&s;uaded that this is the truth."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie, though far from being convinced by the rea&s;oning of her brother, was con&s;oled by his tenderne&s;s, and by degrees regained her &s;erenity, which was, however, again di&s;turbed by a letter from Montalbert, in which he renewed all the profe&s;&s;ions he had made on their parting; told her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> continued to po&s;tpone his journey to Ital<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for &s;ome time longer, and had done &s;o only in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of &s;eeing her again.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="029524_0094_0FE1D44C21F8A3D8">He did not &s;eem to have heard of her father's death. She knew that her being left de&s;titute of fortune would make no alteration whatever in his affection. The little &s;he would in any ca&s;e have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed could never indeed have been any object to him, even if fortune had ever once been in his thoughts. She wrote to him, therefore, of what had happened; and without affecting to deny the partiality &s;he felt for him, and lamenting the little probability of their meeting properly, &s;ubmitted it to him, whether it would not be more prudent to forbear meeting at all till there was le&s;s danger of offending her mother. She told him, that of the future de&s;tination of the family &s;he knew no|thing: but that, from what &s;he could learn, her mother had &s;ome thoughts of taking a &s;mall hou&s;e in or near London, when the period arrived, in which &s;he mu&s;t quit their pre&s;ent habitation.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie now found her&s;elf for a while relieved from the irk&s;ome importunities of Hugh&s;on, who was obliged to be ab&s;ent.

<P>Sometimes when her brother William, who continued at home, was either in&s;tructing her as the kinde&s;t tutor, or amu&s;ing her as the tendere&s;t friend, her heart reproached her for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceri|ty towards &s;uch a brother, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> half tempted to relate to him her e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

Montalbert. But when &s;he had nearly argue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her&s;elf into a re&s;olution of doing this, her natural timidity checked her. She recollected how ma|terial it was to her lover, that their engagements &s;hould remain a &s;ecret: and &s;he was be&s;ides de|terred by the fear that her brother would, from education and principle, in all probability, &s;tren|uou&s;ly oppo&s;e her becoming the wife of a Catho|lic.</P>
<P>But naturally ingenious and candid, it was impo&s;&s;ible for her &s;o well to di&s;&s;imulate, but that Mr. Le&s;&s;ington &s;aw there was &s;omething more on her mind than &s;he ever ventured to expre&s;s. The impre&s;&s;ion that his mother had given him of &s;ome attachment between her and young Vyvian fre|quently returned to his recollection; though he thought it could be only a childi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion on the part of Vyvian, who could think no more of it after he left England, he dreaded lea&s;t the &s;pirits and health of Ro&s;alie might &s;uffer, as he had &s;een &s;o often happen to young women, who had been incautiou&s;ly led to li&s;ten to vows and promi&s;es that were meant by the men that made them only as the amu&s;ement of an idle hour.</P>
<P>In his frequent conver&s;ations with his &s;i&s;ter, therefore, and intermingled with the le&s;&s;ons he &s;ometimes gave her, he found opportunities con|tinually to hint at the weakne&s;s and danger of attending to &s;uch &s;ort of profe&s;&s;ions; while, at other times, he took notice, how generally un|fortunate mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ages turned out to be, where the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were of different religons, giving Mr. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> as an example immediately within

their own knowledge. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, he fixed his eyes on tho&s;e of Ro&s;alie: and, &s;ure that he meant more than he expre&s;&s;ed, her counte|nance betrayed her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; for whatever her brother &s;aid, when he remotely alluded to Vyvian, was equally applicable to Montalbert: and whatever re&s;olutions &s;he &s;ometimes made, when &s;he was alone, to avow ingenuou&s;ly the truth, the&s;e hints entirely deprived her of the courage &s;he had been thus trying to obtain.</P>
<P>Montalbert, who, by means of a &s;ervant at Holmwood Hou&s;e, on who&s;e fidelity he could depend, continued to write to her and receive her letters, became now impatient to learn where was to be her future re&s;idence. As this &s;eemed &s;till uncertain, he implored leave to come down incog. to the neighbourhood of Holmwood; than which, he &s;aid, nothing was more ea&s;y, as he could be concealed in the hou&s;e of a farmer, a tenant of Mr. Vyvian's, who, being a Catholic, was entirely devoted to his &s;ervice, and of an integrity on which he could rely. Ro&s;alie, how|ever, extremely alarmed at &s;uch a propo&s;al, urg|ed &s;o many rea&s;ons why it &s;hould not be executed, and a&s;&s;ured him it would make her &s;o extremely mi&s;erable, that he, for that time, con&s;ented to relinqui&s;h it, which was done with le&s;s reluctance, when &s;he informed him, that within a few days her mother had talked in more po&s;itive terms of their immediate removal to London, or to its neighbourhood; that her broth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to look for a hou&s;e for them: and &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> extremely probable, from the im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ther

expre&s;&s;ed, that they &s;hould there begin the new year. Ro&s;alie was at a lo&s;s to comprehend by what means Montalbert prolonged his &s;tay in England &s;o much beyond the time, when he told her, his mother expected his return to Naples, where &s;he generally re&s;ided. This &s;urpri&s;ed her &s;till more, when &s;he found by part of a letter from Mrs. Vyvian, which Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington read to her, that Charles Vyvian was already gone. The &s;entences of the letter which her mother cho&s;e to communicate ran thus:&mdash;</P>
<P>"I have determined, in order to be near Dr. W&mdash;, without re&s;iding immediately in London, to take an hou&s;e at Hamp&s;tead, and my uphol|&s;terer informs me he has found one that an&s;wers my de&s;cription. Mr. Vyvian has, in his cold way, a&s;&s;ented to my engaging it, taking care, however, to let me under&s;tand, at the &s;ame time, that he thought my not being well or able to live in London was a mere whim, and that the air of Hamp&s;tead was not at all better than at his hou&s;e in Park Lane, or even &s;o good. Till now I did not know that he had taken an hou&s;e in Park Lane, in&s;tead of that in Brook Street; but, alas! my dear old friend, there are many other rea&s;ons, be&s;ides the difference of the air, that will make me adhere to my intention of going to Hamp&s;tead.

The olde&s;t, though not yet &s;ixteen, her father thinks of mar|rying to a man of high rank, with whom &s;he got acquainted while &s;he was with her father's &s;i&s;ter in York&s;hire. He has not, however, the title to which he is to &s;ucceed; but his uncle, who&s;e heir he is, being old and without children, and having &s;ome political connection, I know not what, with Mr. Vyvian, it is by them that this union is propo&s;ed: while the mother of the young man, who has an immen&s;e fortune in her own di&s;po&s;al, has hitherto &s;hewn a di&s;inclination to the match, in the per&s;ua&s;ion that my daughter is &s;till a Catholic. I have learned the&s;e particu|lars from per&s;ons who are in their confidence, which I am not, and I ea&s;ily comprehend that this intended connection adds a &s;trong rea&s;on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> others why the father and the daughter would be quite as well plea&s;ed if we &s;aw no more of each other, during the winter, than we have done for the&s;e two la&s;t &s;ummers.

<P>MRS. Vyvian arrived at the hou&s;e &s;he had taken at Hamp&s;tead a few days after the family of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington had become inhabitants of that village.

it is her being &s;o nearly related to you, or the memory of her pa&s;t kindne&s;s, or both, but to me there is an attraction about Mrs. Vyvian that I never was con&s;cious of in any other per&s;on. The eminent beauty &s;he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed is gone, and its ruins only remain: but the delicacy, the faded loveline&s;s of her whole form, is, perhaps, more intere&s;ting than the mo&s;t animated bloom of youth and health.

<P>"It is long, very long, &s;ince any circum&s;tance has given me &s;uch plea&s;ure as being re&s;tored to my beloved benefactre&s;s; yet &s;he &s;ays little to me.

<P>"Yet, while I think thus, perhaps I am con|tinuing a corre&s;pondence with you, that may be di&s;plea&s;ing to her, that may add to her &s;olicitude, and deprive her of the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing her nephew married to a woman of equal rank and of his own church. This reflection is extremely bitter to me: and it occurs the oftener, becau&s;e I &s;ee with what alarm &s;he thinks of her &s;on's making any other alliance than what his father would chu&s;e for him; though it is very certain that ambition only will govern him, and that, in regard to religion, &s;he cannot, if Mr. Vyvian dictates, be gratified.</P>

<P>That &s;he was totally de&s;titute of fortune gave not a moment's concern to Ro&s;alie.

felt not the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s as to pecuniary circum|&s;tances. But, with the ea&s;y faith of youth, tru&s;t|ed that the attachment of her lover would &s;ave her from every di&s;tre&s;s, and that before &s;he &s;hould be deprived of her &s;urviving parent, who&s;e life was apparently a very good one, &s;he &s;hould be the wife of Montalbert.</P>
<P>He now &s;aw her almo&s;t every day; for as he had always been very attentive to Mrs. Vyvian, there was nothing remarkable in his frequent vi&s;its to her; nor was it &s;trange that he &s;hould renew his &s;light acquaintance with her friends.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Le&s;&s;ington, who&s;e acquaintance increa&s;ed every day, had continual invitations to &s;tay at the hou&s;es of &s;ome of them for &s;everal nights together. Ro&s;alie failed not &s;ometimes to receive the &s;ame kind of compliments: but &s;he generally declined them, &s;aying, that &s;he could not leave her mo|ther alone. But, in fact, &s;he had no wi&s;h to mix in tho&s;e &s;ocieties, or to enter into tho&s;e public amu&s;ements, which gave &s;o much plea&s;ure to her &s;i&s;ter. And Maria, apprehen&s;ive of the &s;uperior elegance of Ro&s;alie, &s;hewed a vi&s;ible di&s;inclination to her joining the&s;e parties, and gradually di&s;+couraged her friends from giving the&s;e invita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by ob&s;erving, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r &s;i&s;ter was of a very r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ed turn; that &s;he had formed connections in a very different &s;phere of life from the re&s;t of her family; and that it was merely giving her the trouble to find excu&s;es, to invite her to &s;cenes or &s;ociety for which &s;he had a decided repugnance.</P>
<P>In a very &s;hort time, therefore, the attornies' and brokers' wives, to whom Mr. Blagham had

<P>Her mother, le&s;s refined, and loving cards ra|ther too much, was not equally difficult as to her companions; though &s;he had really as much af|fection for Mrs. Vyvian as &s;he was capable of feel|ing for any body, &s;he could not help being &s;ome|times &s;en&s;ible of a want of variety. Her friend's piety and e&s;trangement from the world made her, as good Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington &s;ometimes thought, ra|ther re&s;pectable than amu&s;ing: and in&s;tead of &s;uch long vi&s;its from her confe&s;&s;or, Mrs. Le&s;&s;ing|ton &s;ecretly wi&s;hed for another, that they might <HI>make up a rubber.</HI> In&s;en&s;ibly &s;he became ac|quainted with &s;ome "mighty agreeable people" in the village, who never played high, but were happy to make a little &s;nug party ju&s;t to pa&s;s away the long evenings.

<P>But from that unfortunate prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion receiv|ed early in life, that to deny her&s;elf the mo&s;t in|nocent gratifications were &s;acrifices acceptable to Heaven, Mrs. Vyvian frequently ab&s;tained from

Montalbert, be&s;ides the advantages of a very hand&s;ome per&s;on, had the mo&s;t in&s;inuating manners and the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting addre&s;s. He was naturally eloquent&mdash; love rendered his eloquence doubly formidable; and Ro&s;alie had nothing to oppo&s;e to his earne&s;t entreaties for a &s;ecret marriage, but the arms with which he had him&s;elf furni&s;hed her&mdash;the fear of a di&s;covery on the part of his mother, which he owned would injure, indeed ruin, his future pro&s;pects in life. This he &s;till acknow|ledged, but averred that it was impo&s;&s;ibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his mo|ther, who re&s;ided at Naples, &s;hould know that he was married in England.

Ro&s;alie entreated that he would fir&s;t go to Italy, without ri&s;king the di&s;plea&s;ure of a parent on whom he depended. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntalbert declared, he &s;hould be wretched to leave her;

<P>But notwith&s;tanding the frequent opportunities they now had of meeting, and even of pa&s;&s;ing whole hours alone together, how was it po&s;&s;ible that a private marriage could be effected?&mdash;Ro|&s;alie knew that to e&s;cape to Scotland, and return without being mi&s;&s;ed, and without avowedly elop|ing, was impo&s;&s;ible. Montalbert allowed it to be &s;o, but he had another expedient ready&mdash;they might be married by a Catholic prie&s;t. Ro&s;alie had heard but in a vague way, that &s;uch mar|riages were not valid: but Montalbert rea&s;oned her out of this per&s;ua&s;ion.

In point of family and fortune, Montalbert was infinitely her &s;uperior. Her mother, therefore, however &s;he might reproach her with having married clande&s;tinely, could not accu&s;e her with having deba&s;ed her&s;elf&punc; or degraded her family. She had no other per&s;on to whom &s;he was account|able, unle&s;s it was her elder brother, whom &s;he loved too much to be quite ea&s;y as to his &s;enti|ments: but, on the other hand, it was in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could make any objection, unle&s;s it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> difference of religion.

<P>Every opportunity that occurred, Montalbert pre&s;&s;ed his &s;uit with redoubled ardour.

<P>Be&s;ides the con&s;equence, both in England and in Italy, of his family and his connections, the ea&s;e with which a di&s;pen&s;ation might be obtained whenever his mother withdrew her oppo&s;ition, and the pecuniary advantage Montalbert pro|mi&s;ed, the prie&s;t, with whom he had at length &s;ucceeded, knew that Ro&s;alie was the daughter of of a country clergyman&punc; and had no relations who were at all likely to be di&s;plea&s;ed at her marry|ing a man &s;o greatly her &s;uperior, and of cour&s;e not likely to proceed again&s;t one who had com|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a breach of law &s;o much to their advant|age. He rather wi&s;hed to detach Montalbert from his pur&s;uit, by repre&s;enting the great di&s;|tance between him and Ro&s;alie in temporal con|cerns, as well as the difference in &s;piritual affairs, which appeared to him &s;o momentous. Finding it, however, very bootle&s;s to argue with a man of three and twenty, madly in love, he con&s;ent|ed to do as Montalbert required, and reconciled his con&s;cience by that accommodating reflection at hand on &s;o many occa&s;ions, "If I do not do it &s;ome other will." He &s;tipulated with Montal|bert, however, that if there &s;hould be any pro|bability of his incurring the heavy penalty for marrying a minor, that he &s;hould be immediately &s;ent to Rome at the expence of Montalbert; an expedient which Montalbert immediately agreed to, as indeed he would have done to any demands the father thought proper to have made, however unrea&s;onable they might have been.</P>

<P>WHAT had pa&s;&s;ed the preceding evening be|tween Mrs. Vyvian and Ro&s;alie was no &s;ooner re|peated to Montalbert, than it &s;erved as an additi|onal argument to enforce the con&s;ent he had been &s;o long &s;oliciting. Montalbert was of a warm and impetuous temper. Though he had never yet been emancipated from the government of an high-&s;pirited and imperious mother, he was not the le&s;s bent on plea&s;ing him&s;elf, than are tho&s;e who have never been contradicted. It &s;eemed, indeed, as if the &s;evere re&s;traint he had &s;o long habitually been under, di&s;po&s;ed him to be more earne&s;t in a circum&s;tance on which the whole happine&s;s of his life depended: and when Ro&s;alie a&s;ked him how he could hope ever to reconcile his mother to a marriage, to which he hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> owned &s;he would have unconquerable objectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he inquired, in his turn, what amends &s;he co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> make him for oppo&s;ing the only connection which could make him happy, only from prejudice and difference of opinion in matters wherein he could not think as &s;he did, and wherein he thought it unrea&s;onable that her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hould inter|fere

with his choice. "I will certainly not make my mother unea&s;y." &s;aid he. "I will &s;o far pay a compliment to her unfortunate prejudices, as to conceal from her what would make her &s;o. But to relinqui&s;h the only woman I could ever love, is &s;urely a greater &s;acrifice than &s;he ought to demand of me. If, indeed, I were about to di&s;grace her, Ro&s;alie, by uniting my&s;elf with a woman without reputation, or of a very mean and unworthy origin, I &s;hould feel that I ought not to be forgiven. But why, becau&s;e our modes of wor&s;hipping God are different&mdash;why, becau&s;e my mother was born in Italy, and you in England, &s;hould an imaginary barrier be rai&s;ed, which mu&s;t &s;hut me out from happine&s;s for ever?

than as a common acquaintance. Mon|talbert young as he was, had been a great travel|ler. He had lived at Paris, at Vienna, at Tu|rin, at Rome, and at Florence, and had acquir|ed in the more early part of his life the reputation of being a young man of di&s;&s;ipation and intrigue. The&s;e gaieties had been exaggerated: and Mrs. Vyvian had received an impre&s;&s;ion of his liber|tini&s;m, which had never been effaced. She now, therefore, could not imagine, that for &s;uch a man the &s;implicity of Ro&s;alie's beauty could have any attractions; and per&s;uaded, as &s;he was, that he was engaged in intrigues among women of a very different de&s;cription, &s;he &s;ometimes gently re|proved and &s;ometines &s;lightly rallied him, on the&s;e fa&s;hionable exce&s;&s;es. He humoured her in the an&s;wers he gave; li&s;tened as if half di&s;po&s;ed to feel contrition, or defended him&s;elf, as if con|&s;cious of the truth of the&s;e charges&mdash;management which would have concealed his real &s;entiments and de&s;igns from a more penetrating ob&s;erver than Mrs. Vyvian.</P>

Mrs. Vyvian acquie&s;ced, without any remon&s;trance on the cruelty of thus di&s;po&s;ing of her child at &s;o early an age, without even con&s;ulting her mother. A few tears involuntarily fell from her eyes as &s;oon as her unfeeling hu&s;band was gone; but &s;he immediately went to her oratory, and found con&s;olation in the duties of religion; to which, under all the&s;e trying circum&s;tances, &s;he had ever recour&s;e.</P>
<P>But the appearance of the two Mi&s;s Vyvians had another effect on Montalbert. The&s;e ladies, young as they were, had been early initiated into the world.

<P>During the &s;tay Montalbert made at her fa|ther's &s;eat in the north, Mi&s;s Vyvian had been piqued at the little attention he had &s;hewn her, and mortified to ob&s;erve his neglect of tho&s;e charms, which <HI>she</HI> thought, and which her maid a&s;&s;ured her, ought to attract the homage of all the world. That Montalbert <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;o far from paying her this homage, that he took the privilege of his near relation&s;hip to tell her of her faults, was not to be forgiven by Mi&s;s Vyvian. She had by no means forgotten, now that &s;he met him in Lon|don, the &s;lights &s;he had received in York&s;hire, and attacked him with a &s;evere &s;ort of raillery, which he failed not to return, though with more good-humour than the lady de&s;erved. Thus pa&s;|&s;ed the fir&s;t vi&s;it; but, on the &s;econd, (as the young ladies affected &s;till to retain &s;o much con|&s;ideration for their mother as to make their air|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very frequently towards Hamp&s;tead), it hap|pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, unluckily enough, that Mrs. Vyvian, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> aware of their coming, had &s;ent for Ro&s;alie to &s;it with her. Montalbert &s;oon after came in; and as Mrs. Vyvian was plea&s;ed to encourage her ta&s;te in drawing, Montalbert, who, without any affectation under&s;tood it extremely well, was giving her &s;ome rules, and leaning over her chair, was lo&s;t in the plea&s;ure of in&s;tructing his charming pupil. But he &s;ometimes varied a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

what he undertook to teach, and in&s;tead of giving her a &s;ketch of the object he was de&s;cribing, he wrote a line or two in Italian. Mrs. Vyvian was pen&s;ively at work, and did not regard them. The room where they &s;at was at a di&s;tance from the door to which the coaches drove up, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> while this was going on, a footman entered, an|nouncing the two Mi&s;s Vyvians.</P>
<P>Montalbert in confu&s;ion quitted the table near which he was &s;tanding; and Ro&s;alie, who&s;e cheeks were dyed with blu&s;hes, was putting away her drawings. But Mrs. Vyvian, &s;peaking mild|ly, bade her not di&s;turb her&s;elf; then, welcom|ing her daughters, &s;he &s;aid, "My dears, he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your playfellow and acquaintance, the youn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mi&s;s Le&s;&s;ington, your old friend Ro&s;alie."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Vyvian, towards whom her younger &s;i&s;ter &s;eemed to look, as if to regulate her own behavi|our, turned haughtily to Ro&s;alie, and making her a formal and cold courte&s;y, muttered &s;omething in &s;o low a voice, that it could not be heard; then, without taking any further notice, began to tell her mother where &s;he had been, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he had &s;een.

<P>"You &s;taid there then &s;ome time?"</P>
<P>"I cannot be correct," an&s;wered Montalbert, he&s;itating; "our &s;tay, whether there or el&s;ewhere, &s;eemed to me to be a matter of no con&s;equence at the time&mdash;nor could I imagine why it was nece&s;|&s;ary to keep a man's vi&s;it to the &s;eat of his father a &s;ecret.

<P>"Seven or eight days!" repeated Mrs. Vy|vian; "and did Charles pa&s;s &s;o much time at the hou&s;e of Mr. Le&s;&s;ington?"</P>

Mr. Hayward a&s;&s;ured Montalbert, that he would quiet the &s;pirits of Mrs. Vyvian relative to the &s;uppo&s;ed vi&s;its of her &s;on at Barlton Brooks; and recommended it to Montalbert very earne&s;tly to conceal, as far as was now po&s;&s;ible, the di&s;agree|able dialogue which had pa&s;&s;ed that morning. "You know Mr. Vyvian," &s;aid he, "and how violent and unfeeling he is. . . . . . .

<P>Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington had gone to London early in the morning, was to go to a play that night, and to an opera the next, a &s;pectacle which &s;he had not &s;een for many years, and about which &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed as much eagerne&s;s as a girl. It was in hopes of making his advantage of this ab&s;ence, that Montalbert had met Ro&s;alie at Mrs. Vyvian's in the morning. Ro&s;alie, dreading importunity which &s;he had no longer re&s;olution to contend with, had taken &s;helter there.

The country &s;ervants of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, a maid and a boy, took every thing that was told them for granted. The ceremony was &s;oon over; and a te&s;timony of its performance being given to Ro&s;alie, the prie&s;t departed for London with the friend of Montalbert, while he him&s;elf went to Mrs. Vyvian's, where he intended to dine, and where he hoped his aunt would, without any &s;o|licitation, &s;end for Ro&s;alie. In this, however, he was mi&s;taken. He found Mrs. Vyvian &s;o much affected by the &s;cene of the day before, that &s;he was confined to her bed. She admitted him to her bed &s;ide: and he was &s;hocked to &s;ee the havoc which even a few hours acute unea&s;i|ne&s;s had made in her enfeebled frame.

<P>Montalbert remained &s;ilent in anxious expec|tation of what &s;he was going to &s;ay&punc; but, as if &s;he could not collect re&s;olution enough, &s;he &s;igh|ed deeply, put her hand to her head, and &s;eemed to &s;uffer great pain there; then, becoming more languid, &s;aid, "But I hope I <HI>shall</HI> &s;ee you again, Harry, when I am more able to conver&s;e: yet &s;urely you do not mean to prolong much your &s;tay in England?"</P>

<P>It was but too certain, however, that he had that morning received the mo&s;t po&s;itive commands from his mother to &s;et out immediately, mingled with &s;ome &s;evere reproaches for his having delay|ed his journey, from time to time, &s;o much be|yond that which he had originally fixed for his &s;tay.

As he could not retreat without being &s;een, and his

unea&s;y curio&s;ity was excited by this unexpected and unwelcome return, he advanced towards Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, and was beginning a &s;peech about Mrs. Vyvian, who&s;e name he meant to u&s;e as an excu&s;e for his calling; but, without &s;eem|ing to attend, &s;he began to apologize for not hav|ing it in her power to a&s;k him in, being, &s;he &s;aid, in great alarm on account of her daughter.</P>
<P>"What daughter?&mdash;and oh! for Heaven's &s;ake, what is the matter?"&mdash;were words that were on the point of i&s;&s;uing from Montalbert's lips, who thought only of Ro&s;alie: when this in|di&s;cretion on his part was prevented by Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington's proceeding to tell him, that her elde&s;t married daughter, who was near her time, had &s;uffered from being overturned in a cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, and had entreated to &s;ee her mother, who had, therefore, ha&s;tened from London, where &s;he re|ceived the letter, to pack up a few nece&s;&s;aries, and was &s;etting out po&s;t immediately afterwards for the hou&s;e of her daughter in Su&s;&s;ex. Mon|talbert, alarmed le&s;t Ro&s;alie was going too, troubled &s;o much, that he had not courage to a&s;k but to leave the hou&s;e without knowing was im|po&s;&s;ible. Regardle&s;s, therefore, of the rules of decorum, which certainly demanded that he &s;hould ab&s;ent him&s;elf, he followed Mrs. Le&s;&s;ing|ton into the hou&s;e, where his &s;udden re-appear|ance, and the unexpected arrival of her mother, had &s;uch an effect on the countenance and man|ner of Ro&s;alie, as could not have e&s;caped ob&s;erva|tion, had not Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington and Maria been both much engaged with the immediate prepara|tions

for their journey; for amid&s;t her maternal anxiety for her daughter, the elder lady was by no means indifferent to the appearance &s;he was to make among her former country neighbours and though &s;he was &s;till in deep mourning, &s;he ob&s;erved that it was not the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to be "tolerably dre&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Maria was of cour&s;e more &s;olicitous on this important matter than her mother: and in the mid&s;t of their giving orders to one to run to the mantua-makers, and another to fetch home a new bonnet, &amp;c. &amp;c. they neither of them &s;eem|ed to recollect that it was nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome arrangement about Ro&s;alie, or even to remember that &s;he was in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She remained, therefore, a few moments in the parlour with Montalbert, who, advancing trembling to her, inquired eagerly if &s;he al&s;o was going? "I think not," an&s;wered &s;he.

<P>This pretence could not, however, be long continued: and Ro&s;alie returned, though reluc|tantly, to the common bu&s;ine&s;s of life, while Montalbert, &s;carcely knowing what he did, pur|&s;ued his way to the &s;ea coa&s;t from whence he was to embark for France, meaning to pa&s;s through that country to Italy. But the greater the di&s;|tance became between him and the object of his love, the le&s;s &s;upportable it became.

<P>As it was now a time when multitudes of Engli&s;h, who had long been prevented by the war from vi&s;iting the continent, were ha&s;tening to France, Montalbert was not many hours waiting for a wind, before he met &s;ome of his acquaintance, from whom it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape.

<P>"You would not &s;urely wonder if there were," an&s;wered Ro&s;alie. "I have often wondered at my own incon&s;equence in not being more depre&s;|&s;ed, when I recollect, that, whenever I lo&s;e my mother, I &s;hall become a friendle&s;s and de&s;titute orphan."</P>
<P>"Not, if I live," &s;aid Mrs. Vyvian. Then, pau&s;ing a moment, &s;he added, in a &s;low and &s;o|lemn voice&mdash;"for, as I think, my early indul|gence to my daughters, or rather to my&s;elf, in having you &s;o much at Holmwood during your infancy, has perhaps been the means of &s;trang|ing you from your family, I con&s;ider it as my duty to make you what little amends I can. Much, alas! is not in my power, for the unin|tentional injury I have done you."</P>
<P>The tears ro&s;e in the eyes of Ro&s;alie as Mrs. Vyvian concluded this &s;entence. "O no deare&s;t Madam," an&s;wered &s;he&mdash;"your kindne&s;s to me, never, never, injured me: &s;o far otherwi&s;e, that I think I &s;hould, <HI>but</HI> for that kindne&s;s, have been the mo&s;t unhappy creature in the world. At lea&s;t I know that the only moments for which I would wi&s;h to live are tho&s;e when you permit me to be with you."</P>
<P>"And therefore it is, my love, that I think I have injured you. Your mother, your &s;i&s;ters, are happy among acquaintance and parties of their own, from which you fly with di&s;gu&s;t: nor is this

all&mdash;I am &s;en&s;ible that you have refu&s;ed a very advantageous match from the &s;ame prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear Mrs. Vyvian, that, as far as I am able to judge, I &s;hould have refu&s;ed Mr. Hugh&s;on, though I had never enjoyed the advantages of being admitted to Holmwood. In|deed, had I been in the mo&s;t humble condition of life, I am &s;ure I &s;hould have preferred remain|ing in it, and even embracing the harde&s;t labour, to giving my per&s;on to a man from whom my heart recoiled."</P>
<P>A deep and long-drawn &s;igh, as if &s;ome painful recollections had ari&s;en at that moment, half interrupted the an&s;wer of Mrs. Vyvian, who &s;aid, "You are certainly right in the &s;entiment, Ro&s;alie: but it is &s;ometimes not in the power of young women to re&s;i&s;t parental authority.

<P>The eyes of Mrs. Vyvian, which, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+nerally &s;oft and languid, were very expre&s;&s;ive, were fixed &s;teadily on the countenance of Ro|&s;alie as &s;he a&s;ked this que&s;tion. Ro&s;alie, who af|fected to be &s;teadily at work, looked up, and met the&s;e penetrating eyes. A deep blu&s;h &s;uffu&s;ed her cheeks; &s;he was con&s;cious of it, and became more confu&s;ed. Yet, making an effort to recol|lect her&s;elf, and to &s;peak with compo&s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, "O nothing is &s;o&mdash;&s;o very unlikely, as that <HI>any</HI> man &s;hould have a preference for me!&mdash;I
<PB N="154" REF="029524_0156_0FE1D4EFACBA39D0">
never thought whether I &s;hould refu&s;e any other offer or no: becau&s;e it is &s;o improbable, that it is hardly worth while to &s;uppo&s;e about it."</P>
<P>"Not &s;o improbable as you affect to imagine, Ro&s;alie; but you are not &s;incere. I do not wi&s;h my dear, to di&s;tre&s;s you; and we will drop the di&s;cour&s;e at this time.

<P>More and more confu&s;ed, and not doubting but that by &s;ome means or other Mrs. Vyvian had di&s;covered her marriage, &s;he was too much agitated to allow her&s;elf to con&s;ider, whether, if this were really the ca&s;e, it was likely Mrs. Vy|vian &s;hould &s;peak as &s;he had done. But trembling and breathle&s;s &s;he ha&s;tened to put her work into the work-ba&s;ket, and, affecting to under&s;tand what her friend had la&s;t &s;aid as an hint to de|part, &s;he &s;miled, and replying that &s;he was al|ways happy to an&s;wer any que&s;tions from her, and that &s;he hoped always to be ingenuous with &s;o good a friend, &s;he ha&s;tened away, which Mrs. Vyvian did not oppo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE night that followed this conver&s;ation was the mo&s;t unea&s;y Ro&s;alie had ever yet known. From what had pa&s;&s;ed &s;he could not doubt but that Mrs. Vyvian knew of her marriage. Yet it was incomprehen&s;ible if &s;he did, that &s;he &s;hould have expre&s;&s;ed &s;o little anger or di&s;approbation: yet what el&s;e but her knowing of the mutual at|tachment between her nephew and her protegee could have urged her to &s;peak as &s;he did?</P>
<P>The various conjectures that agitated the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Ro&s;alie, allowed her not to &s;leep. She h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> never till now ta&s;ted, in its full bitterne&s;s, the pain that is inflicted on an ingenuous mind by concealment and di&s;&s;imulation. Con&s;cious that &s;he merited the lo&s;s of Mrs. Vyvian's good opini|on, and that the longer this my&s;tery was contin|ued on her part, the more unpardonable it would appear, &s;he endeavoured to rea&s;on her&s;elf into a re&s;olution of unbo&s;oming her&s;elf to Mrs. Vyvian, and rather enduring her reproaches for precipi|tancy and indi&s;cretion, than &s;uffer the mi&s;ery of living in continual dread of being detected in a fal&s;ehood. The mo&s;t probable conjecture &s;he could form, was, that Mrs. Vyvian knew the
<PB N="156" REF="029524_0158_0FE1D4F50135B910">
truth, and had held the conver&s;ation &s;he had heard the preceding evening to give Ro&s;alie an opportunity of declaring what was already known. This &s;uppo&s;ition &s;trengthened her wavering re|&s;olves: and &s;he aro&s;e in the morning, believing &s;he had force of mind enough to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecret that weighed upon her mind. But when a note came from Mrs. Vyvian reque&s;ting to &s;ee her as &s;oon as &s;he had breakfa&s;ted, her courage at once for&s;ook her, and hardly could &s;he find &s;trength to obey the &s;ummons.</P>
<P>On her arrival, however at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Vyvian, &s;he found nothing remarkable in the manner or looks of her friend, who &s;eemed as to her health to &s;uffer le&s;s than u&s;ual. Ro&s;alie in|quired, as &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to do, if &s;he &s;hould fetch a book. Mrs. Vyvian an&s;wered no; and bid her take her work.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time the conver&s;ation ran on indiffer|rent topics. At length, contriving to bring it without abruptne&s;s to the point &s;he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hed, Mrs. Vyvian renewed the &s;ubject on which &s;he had touched the day before. Ro&s;alie, who&s;e heart was beating &s;o violently that &s;he could hardly breathe, li&s;tened to her in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"I &s;poke to you ye&s;terday, my love," &s;aid &s;he, "with a de&s;ire to hear your &s;entiments on a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very important to you.

in mo&s;t re&s;pects unexceptionable, were to be found?"</P>
<P>"I am not my own mi&s;tre&s;s, you know, my dear Madam," &s;aid Ro&s;alie, &s;peaking this equi|vocation, for it could not be called a fal&s;ehood, in &s;o low a voice as hardly to be heard.</P>
<P>"That is true," an&s;wered Mrs. Vyvian; "but I think, indeed I am <HI>sure,</HI> your <HI>friends</HI> would not di&s;approve the propo&s;al in que&s;tion&mdash;indeed there can be but one objection to it, which I think would not have much weight; the gentleman is a Catholic."</P>
<P>"A Catholic!" repeated Ro&s;alie faintly.</P>
<P>"You are &s;urpri&s;ed, I &s;ee; but you know, Ro&s;alie, there <HI>are</HI> con&s;iderations that may influ|ence per&s;ons to overlook this difference of opinion.

Would you receive &s;uch a man as your hu&s;band?"</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attempt Ro&s;alie made to an&s;wer this que&s;tion failed; &s;he was unable to articulate a &s;yllable. Collecting, however, all her re&s;olution, &s;he at la&s;t found courage to &s;ay, "I am very &s;en|&s;ible, Madam, that I ought to feel extremely grateful for the notice of any man of whom you have a good opinion;&mdash;but&mdash;my dear, dear be|ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;s," added &s;he in a voice that her agitati|on re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red indi&s;tinct, and ri&s;ing from her &s;eat,

"I cannot any longer conceal the truth from you &mdash;<HI>I am already</HI> married."</P>
<P>"Already married!" exclaimed Mrs. Vyvian with a tone and look of amazement;&mdash;"Already married!&mdash;Merciful Heaven! and to whom?"</P>
<P>"Can I hope, deare&s;t and be&s;t of women, to be forgiven, when I tell you&mdash;O no!&mdash;I dare not &mdash;you will reproach me, perhaps dete&s;t me, and ca&s;t me off for ever."</P>
<P>"Speak," &s;aid Mrs. Vyvian, trembling as much as the unhappy girl&mdash;&s;peak". . . . . . She had her &s;alts in her hand; and her eyes were eagerly fixed on the face of Ro&s;alie, who was compelled to &s;upport her&s;elf by holding the table.</P>
<P>"Since you have ju&s;t &s;aid, Madam, that a Catholic might, in your opinion, make &s;uch an alliance.". . . . . .</P>
<P>"A Catholic!" cried Mrs. Vyvian, &s;till more faintly.</P>
<P>"I might hope, perhaps," continued Ro&s;alie, "to be forgiven for every thing, but the pre&s;ump|tion of becoming part of your family&mdash;of marrying a very near relation of your own."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie might have continued her confe&s;&s;ion without interruption another hour. Mrs. Vyvi|an heard no more, but &s;unk back in her chair to all appearance lifele&s;s.</P>
<P>In an agony of terror, to which no words can do ju&s;tice, Ro&s;alie flew towards her, then to the bell, which &s;he rang with violence: and when her &s;ervants came, &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in carrying Mrs. Vyvian to her room, though &s;he was her&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ituation but little better. . . . . .

&s;aid &s;he,&mdash;"I &s;hall never be forgiven. . . . .

<P>While Ro&s;alie was making this mournful mo|nologue on one &s;ide of the bed, the applications u&s;ed by Mrs. Vyvian's woman were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that &s;he opened her eyes; but, turning them on Ro&s;alie, &s;he &s;eemed &s;hocked by the &s;ight of her, and without &s;peaking, waved her hand that &s;he might leave her.</P>
<P>This was too much. Ro&s;alie, regardle&s;s of the pre&s;ence of the &s;ervant, threw her&s;elf upon her knees by the bed &s;ide, and attempted to take Mrs. Vyvian's hand&mdash;&s;he &s;natched it from her with abhorrence, and, &s;peaking with great dif|ficulty, &s;aid, "Wretched, mo&s;t wretched girl&mdash; if you would not &s;ee me die before your face&mdash; go&mdash;I conjure you go."</P>
<P>"Hear me but for one moment; let Hallam leave the room while I &s;peak to you for the la&s;t time, if it mu&s;t be &s;o."</P>
<P>The maid, who under&s;tood nothing of all this, and who felt no curio&s;ity to know what it meant, re&s;trained by &s;ome degree of terror, retired with|out being bid; and Ro&s;alie again mo&s;t earne&s;tly imploring for pity and pardon, Mrs. Vyvian, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice at once &s;hrill and plaintive, &s;aid&mdash;</P>

<P>"You are my daughter," &s;aid Mrs. Vyvian, the unhappy child of an unfortunate man, who&s;e very name I never &s;uffer to e&s;cape my lips."</P>
<P>This confirmed Ro&s;alie in the apprehen&s;ions that her mind was deranged; but, heart &s;truck with horror, &s;he could not &s;peak. Mrs. Vyvian, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, proceeded&mdash;</P>

<P>Ro&s;alie, more and more amazed, and doubting the evidence of her &s;en&s;es, could only li&s;ten in breathle&s;s wonder, while Mrs. Vyvian, who&s;e heart &s;eemed to be already relieved, proceeded&mdash;</P>

Mrs. Vyvian, yielding for a moment to the tenderne&s;s &s;he had for &s;o many years &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed, cla&s;ped her daughter fondly to her bo&s;om, and, for almo&s;t the fir&s;t time in her life, called her by the dear name of her child. There was &s;ome danger that they would both have indulged too long in the&s;e effu&s;ions of natural affection, but a rap at the chamber-door compelled them ha&s;tily to recover them&s;elves. It was a me&s;&s;age from the venerable Mr. Hayward, who, return|ing from his morning walk, had heard of Mrs. Vyvian's being greatly indi&s;po&s;ed, and now &s;o|licited leave to enquire after her.

To find her&s;elf the daughter of Mrs. Vyvian, though of her father &s;he was yet ignorant, &s;eemed to be knowledge more flattering, more elevating than any event that could be imagined.&mdash;She was now ready to account for a thou&s;and things which had before &s;eemed extraordinary.

<P>ROSALIE now &s;aw the beloved parent, whom &s;he yet dared not own, every day. And the di&s;covery of her marriage with Montalbert, which &s;he had &s;o much dreaded, had been the means of procuring her the knowledge of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;|&s;ing &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a mother, who now &s;ecr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> indulged all the tenderne&s;s of her heart. The elde&s;t Mi&s;s Vyvian, now Mrs. Bo&s;worth, was &s;till at the family &s;eat of her hu&s;band with her &s;i&s;ter, and her father was gone into the north du|ring the rece&s;s of parliament.

<P><PB N="168" REF="029524_0170_0FE1D505514A9AF0">It was now indeed that &s;uch a friend was more nece&s;&s;ary to her than ever; and it was more re|qui&s;ite that this dear friend &s;hould know &s;he was a wife, &s;ince &s;he found it was probable &s;he &s;hould become a mother. Nothing was more immedi|ately pre&s;&s;ing than that Montalbert &s;hould be in|formed of this. But without the concurrence of Mrs. Vyvian, and indeed without her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he dared not hazard a letter, which, if it fell into the hands of his mother, might be of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equence. The two letters &s;he had received from Montalbert were but too ex|pre&s;&s;ive of his de&s;pondence and unea&s;ine&s;s; and though he &s;eemed to &s;tifle part of the angui&s;h of his heart from tenderne&s;s towards his wife, &s;he &s;aw that the reception his mother had given him was far from having been plea&s;ant, and that, while he yet acknowledged the nece&s;&s;ity of his journey, he regretted that he had made it.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Vyvian, who had received letters from her &s;on, knew yet more. She had learned that one rea&s;on for the impatience, expre&s;&s;ed by the mother of Montalbert for his return to Naples, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that &s;he had projected a marriage for him with the daughter of a friend of her own, who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lately lo&s;t her hu&s;band, a Roman of high rank, and was now a very rich widow. Charles Vyvian related all the advantages offered by &s;uch an alliance. On the beauty of the young widow, and her predilection in favour of Montalbert, with whom &s;he had been acquainted before her fir&s;t marriage, he dwelt particularly; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> added, laughingly, that he &s;uppo&s;ed Harry had left his

heart in England, for at pre&s;ent he &s;eemed as in|&s;en&s;ible to the charms of the lady, as deaf to the remon&s;trances of his mother.</P>
<P>Mrs. Vyvian was extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this intelligence, which &s;he carefully avoided com|municating. Though &s;he loved Montalbert ex|tremely, &s;he had many doubts whether in affairs of love he had more honour than other gay young men. She had rea&s;on formerly to believe his principles were very free, and &s;he could not but fear, that he might con&s;ider his marriage with Ro&s;alie, celebrated as it had been contrary to the laws of England, as an engagement &s;o little bind|ing, that he might break it whenever ambition or the love of variety might induce him to it.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation, therefore, of this beloved child, more dear than ever to her, was a dreadful weight on the &s;pirits of Mrs. Vyvian: and &s;he now felt renewed, in the per&s;on of Ro&s;alie, all tho&s;e cruel &s;en&s;ations which had corroded her own heart, when, betrayed by an unhappy pa&s;&s;ion into g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and dangerous imprudence, &s;he was compelled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> undergo all the meanne&s;s of concealment, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the terrors of detection. The &s;imilarity of their de&s;tinies hitherto endeared to her mother this lovely unfortunate young woman, who &s;eemed too likely to be doubly a victim. Yet, circum&s;tan|ced as &s;he was her&s;elf, &s;he could not protect her openly, and even trembled every time &s;he reflect|ed that, with the return of the family of her hu&s;|band&punc; the indulgence of ever &s;eeing Ro&s;alie mu&s;t be re&s;igned; and that they mu&s;t equally &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their fears and their affections.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="029524_0172_0FE1D5078964A1F0">Every day rendered the &s;ituation of Ro&s;alie more critical. Though Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington &s;eemed, as if by a tacit agreement with Mrs. Vyvian, not to notice the preference Ro&s;alie &s;o evidently gave to the latter, and to &s;uffer her to act as &s;he plea&s;|ed, others, who &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed her a member of the Le&s;&s;ington family, could not be but &s;urpri&s;ed at her a&s;&s;ociating &s;o little with them, nor help re|marking, that whenever they did &s;ee her among them, there was &s;omething peculiar in her man|ner and appearance. The men, who had admir|ed her beauty, but who had been repul&s;ed by her coldne&s;s, now di&s;covered, as they always do on &s;uch occa&s;ions, that the poor girl was in love: and while the elder ladies thought her proud, conceited, and full of airs, &s;ome of the younger entirely agreed with them; while others, more candid or more &s;en&s;ible, pitied her on the &s;uppo|&s;ition that &s;he had an "unhappy attachment;" or, as the dam&s;els of the lower rank would have expre&s;&s;ed it, "that &s;he was cro&s;&s;ed in love."</P>
<P>Mrs. Vyvian was too deeply intere&s;ted to have a moment's tranquility; and when the hour of Mrs. Bo&s;worth's return approached, this anxiety became more and more in&s;upportable: and it was certain that health &s;o delicate could not long re&s;i&s;t &s;uch painful &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>After long deliberation and con&s;ulting with the Abbe Hayward, who had long been aware of who Ro&s;alie really was, Mrs. Vyvian determined to write to Montalbert with the &s;ame precautions as tho&s;e Ro&s;alie u&s;ed by his directions. This &s;he executed, not without finding it the mo&s;t difficult

and painful ta&s;k &s;he had ever undertaken. To avow the di&s;&s;imulation of her whole life to her nephew, to explain to him circum&s;tances of which &s;he knew he mu&s;t be entirely ignorant, words were not ea&s;ily found. At length, how|ever, the letter was written and &s;ent off: and &s;he returned once more to her long and pen&s;ive con|ferences with the object of it, with whom al&s;o a ta&s;k yet remained quite as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to her.</P>
<P>This was to tell Ro&s;alie to whom &s;he owed her birth; to give a relation of circum&s;tances which &s;he knew mu&s;t appear very &s;trange to her. Mrs. Vyvian &s;aw her often look as if &s;he at once dread|ed and expected this explanation; but never yet had &s;he acquired courage to begin the conver&s;a|tion, and Ro&s;alie was too timid to make any in|quiries that led to it.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Bo&s;worth and Mi&s;s Vyvian would now return in a &s;hort time: and then the mother and daughter mu&s;t no longer indulge them&s;elves with being together for whole days as they were now&mdash;a heavy pre&s;entiment of future evil, to which the former was too apt to yield, told her, that if the pre&s;ent time was lo&s;t, future opportuni|ties might be wanting.&mdash;The next morning, therefore, after having made her re&s;olution&punc; &s;he put it into execution.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie, whom &s;he had de&s;ired to come early, was &s;eated at work by her bed-&s;ide, for &s;he was too much indi&s;po&s;ed to leave it; when Mrs. Vy|vian, opening a little ca&s;ket which &s;he had pre|viou&s;ly placed near her pillow, put into the hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Ro&s;alie a miniature picture, and, in a tremb|ling

<P>"Does my father yet live, Madam?" Ro&s;alie would have &s;aid; but &s;he could not articulate the &s;entence. Her mother, however, under&s;tood her. "He does," replied &s;he, "but not in Eng|land.

He knew that I was compelled to marry him. He was indelicate and &s;elfi&s;h enough to con&s;ider only the convenience of

<P>"You &s;hould have an idea of what &s;ort of a man, my father, Mr. Montalbert, was, before you can imagine how I was &s;ituated. I do not believe you know more than his name; for Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington was probably cautious of entering into any part of my unfortunate hi&s;tory.&mdash;Mr. Montalbert then, my father, was the elder bro|ther of a family, which, from its name, was evidently of Norman extraction&mdash;a boa&s;t that is generally deemed a &s;ufficient ground for the pride of ance&s;try in England. The Montalberts, how|ever, could carry their genealogy much farther, and were content to begin it only among the Em|perors of the Ea&s;t. As Engli&s;h Peers, they adhered to the unfortunate James the Second, were bani&s;hed with him, and lo&s;t their property, their title, and their rights as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. My father, being much connected with noble families more fortunate, had intere&s;t enough
<PB N="174" REF="029524_0176_0FE1D50F9721B120">
to obtain re&s;titution of a &s;mall part indeed of the great fortunes of his family, but &s;ufficient to give him once more a footing in England, where he was happy enough to marry one of its riche&s;t heire&s;&s;es. My mother who was the only offspring of an alliance between two noble hou&s;es, inherit|ed all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and gave them and her&s;elf to my father, in de&s;pite of the oppo&s;ition of &s;uch of her family as pretended to any right of giving their opinion; for her father and mother being dead, there were only uncles or cou&s;ins who&s;e di&s;&s;ent could not prevent her following her own inclinations.</P>
<P>"This great property was divided between me and my brother, the father of Montalbert, your hu&s;band, but not equally; for he had of cour&s;e the greate&s;t &s;hare. The noble ca&s;tle and the e&s;tates, belonging to it in the north, are the principal part of what remains to him in England; for having early formed connections upon the continent, he never loved or lived long in Eng|land. His life was not long, for he died &s;oon after the birth of your hu&s;band; &s;o &s;oon, indeed, that he had neglected to make for him the provi|&s;ion he ought to have made, and, by a prior will, Harry Montalbert was left almo&s;t entirely depen|dent on his mother.</P>

about fifteen; and, from that time, you may imagine, my life was very reclu&s;e; for then the country around it was le&s;s inhabited, and the roads le&s;s pa&s;&s;able than they are now.</P>
<P>"Har&s;h as my father was, I loved him very tenderly, and therefore did not murmur at the confinement thus impo&s;ed upon me at a time of life when other young women enter the world and enjoy its plea&s;ures: nor did the fatigues of con|&s;tant attendance in a &s;ick chamber, and continu|ing to read &s;ometimes for half the night, for a moment deter me from doing my duty, or for a moment induce me to repine.</P>
<P>"I have &s;ince thought, Ro&s;alie, that this peri|od, with all its little hard&s;hips and inconvenien|ces, was the happie&s;t of my life.&mdash;My friend Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, though then married, and &s;ome years older than me, was &s;till often my compani|on, and &s;hared a ta&s;k which without her I could not have executed &s;o well.

<P>"One of the &s;ons, however, having been &s;ent young to the Ea&s;t Indies, had done &s;o well, that he wrote to have <HI>two</HI> of his three brothers follow him, informing his father, that though he could not make remittances for the purpo&s;e of &s;itting them out, he was &s;ure when they arrived there, of getting them into &s;ituations nearly as advan|tageous as his own.</P>
<P>"In con&s;equence of this, their father &s;ent his third and fourth &s;ons to England, to &s;olicit among their friends and their relations the means of equipping them in &s;uch a way as might enable them to avail them&s;elves of the&s;e advantageous pro&s;pects.

<P>IN the evening Mrs. Vyvian found her&s;elf able to proceed, and thus continued her narrative:&mdash;</P>
<P>"My friend Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, who had now a family of children, was no longer at liberty to give me &s;o much of her time as &s;he had hitherto done; but, at this period, the living of May|field, which was in my father's gift, becoming vacant, I was fortunate enough to procure it for her hu&s;band, and had the comfort of &s;eeing her &s;ettled within four miles of Holmwood.</P>

But &s;ometimes, when my fathers old &s;ervant was able to give that attendance for which he was often di&s;qualified by illne&s;s, Orm&s;by was unexpectedly relea&s;ed; and it was at one of the&s;e periods that the explanation was brought on, which afterwards co&s;t me &s;o dear.</P>
<P>"My father had been extremely ill for many days. It was &s;pring, a &s;ea&s;on that always brought on the mo&s;t painful paroxy&s;ms of the gout: his old &s;ervant, hardly le&s;s a victim to this di&s;ea&s;e than him&s;elf, had been laid up, and Orm&s;by had been my father's attendant for ten days, almo&s;t without taking off his clothes, and certainly with|out having had any interval of re&s;t.</P>
<P>"Barford, my father's &s;ervant, having a little recovered, came down to his relief; for no other per&s;on was &s;uffered to enter the room, but Orm&s;|by, my&s;elf, and this man.</P>
<P>"At this time Orm&s;by was &s;o much fatigued, that he could hardly &s;upport him&s;elf. He ha&s;ten|ed to procure what refre&s;hment a change of clothes afforded, and then to relieve a violent head-ache, the effect of want of &s;leep, he wandered into the garden for the air. . . . . .

Ro&s;alie, the temple at the end of the avenue of &s;tone pines&mdash;thither I often went with my work, or with a book, when I was alone; behind it is, you recollect, a cop&s;e, which, at the &s;ea&s;on of the year now pre&s;ent, for it was the middle of May, echoed with the mu&s;ic of innumerable birds. Every object breathed of peace and beauty; and as <HI>my</HI> heart had long &s;ince learned to a&s;&s;ociate the idea of Orm&s;by with every &s;cene that gave me plea&s;ure, I was meditating on fu|ture po&s;&s;ibilities of happine&s;s, when the object of my dangerous contemplations &s;uddenly appear|ed coming towards the place where I &s;at.</P>

which was &s;o likely to ari&s;e between two young per&s;ons. I had imagined, that, finding us both nece&s;&s;ary to his comfort, he intended to unite us. My fortune mu&s;t be &s;uch, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, made any con&s;ideration as to that of my lover entirely needle&s;s.&mdash;Alas! how little is the inexperienced mind of youth capable of judging of tho&s;e motives that influence men in advanced life. Though my father was retired from the world, he had not lo&s;t in retirement the pa&s;&s;ions that influence the men of that world. On the contrary, living where he was the lord of many miles, where none, either in his hou&s;e or around it, ever di&s;|puted his will, he had, like a de&s;pot, entirely forgotten that others had any will at all. Of a marriage of love he had no idea; nor did it ever occur to him, as a thing po&s;&s;ible, that a depen|dent relation, who was indebted to his bounty for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, could dare to lift his eyes to a daughter of the hou&s;e of Montalbert, for whom, though he had never yet hinted at them, my father had very different views.</P>
<P>"But love, too apt to li&s;ten to the voice of hope, &s;uffered us not to &s;ee the mi&s;ery we were laying up for our&s;elves; and even amid&s;t the re|proaches Orm&s;by often made him&s;elf, for what he termed treachery and ingratitude, the flatter|ing illu&s;ions into which we were betrayed by youthful inexperience, not only quieted the&s;e alarms of con&s;cience, but made us li&s;ten with &s;omething bordering on re&s;entment to the remon|&s;trances of my friend, Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, who took every occa&s;ion of repre&s;enting the danger of my

Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, who undoubtedly knew the world and my father's temper much better than I did, left nothing un|&s;aid that was likely to convince me of this danger|ous error.

This menace which I knew &s;he would never execute, had an effect exactly oppo&s;ite to that which &s;he intended. The idea of Orm&s;by driven from the hou&s;e, &s;uffering poverty and mortification, and abandoned by the world only for his attachment to me, endeared him to me infinitely more than he would have been had I &s;een him &s;urrounded with affluence and pro&s;perity. Nothing is &s;o dangerous as pity; and my friend, in attempting to &s;ave me, ha&s;tened my ruin by exciting it.</P>
<P>"I cannot, Ro&s;alie, trace the progre&s;s of this fatal pa&s;&s;ion. My confe&s;&s;or, who alone might have checked its progre&s;s, was &s;urely carele&s;s of his charge, or was po&s;&s;ibly become indifferent to the welfare of a family he was &s;oon on the point of quitting.

In the&s;e di&s;mal rambles rain and tempe&s;t, and once or twice night, overtook me. I was carele&s;s or in&s;en&s;ible of outward circum&s;tances; and certainly if my father had not determined to &s;hut his eyes to the truth, as if the only alternative was between extreme &s;everity and total ignorance, he mu&s;t have di&s;covered from my conduct that all his &s;u&s;picions did not go beyond the reality.</P>
<P>"Some very fatal cata&s;trophe would have fol|lowed the &s;tate of mind I was in, had not the pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and friendly councils of the Abbe Hayward, and
<PB N="207" REF="029524_0209_0FE1D5D825ADACF8">
the a&s;&s;iduous care of Helene, &s;aved me from my|&s;elf: the one exhorted me to patience, and a reli|ance on the mercy of Heaven; the other &s;oothed and flattered my &s;ickening &s;oul with the hope of better days, and enabled me to endure the pre&s;ent by encouraging me to look forward to the return of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, who alone &s;eemed to be like|ly to advi&s;e and &s;uccour me in a &s;ituation which every hour and every day rendered more peril|ous.</P>
<P>"Mr. Hayward frequently followed me into the depth of the woods, argued, remon&s;trated, and then &s;oothed and endeavoured to con&s;ole me. I heard his arguments, and even his reproo&s;s, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and calmne&s;s; but when he told me that I ought to be cheerful, to be re&s;igned, to endeavour to conquer my affection for Orm&s;by, and to attempt by every means in my power, to conceal that it had ever exi&s;ted to &s;o fatal an exce&s;s&mdash;I lo&s;t my patience, and my re&s;pect for this good man did not prevent my flying from him with &s;omething like re&s;entment and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>"So pa&s;&s;ed a month&mdash;a wretched month, during which time the name of Orm&s;by had never reach|ed my ears, &s;ave only when Mr. Hayward, in the conver&s;ation which he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to hold with me, reluctantly named him, or when I could &s;o far command the agonies with which my heart was torn as to name him to Helene, and li&s;ten to the conjectures with which &s;he attempt|ed to relieve me as to what was become of him.</P>
<P>"Of this, however, &s;he knew no more than
<PB N="208" REF="029524_0210_0FE1D58A01325DB0">
I did; yet, from the looks and manners of the &s;ervants with whom &s;he conver&s;ed at the times when they were nece&s;&s;arily altogether, a thou&s;and vague ideas floated in her mind, to which &s;he &s;ometimes gave utterance with more zeal than prudence. From her I learned, that the two men who had di&s;appeared when Orm&s;by was &s;o &s;uddenly &s;ent away had never &s;ince returned, and that the places they filled were now occupied by others. I heard too, that though the name of Orm&s;by was never mentioned whenever the &s;teward, my father's old &s;ervant, or the hou&s;e|keeper were pre&s;ent; yet that the inferior &s;er|vants were continually whi&s;pering &s;trange things, and that the people in the neighbourhood talked of nothing el&s;e; &s;ome of them going &s;o far as to &s;ay, that inquiry ought to be made by people authori&s;ed, for that Mr. Orm&s;by had certainly been &s;pirited away; while others gave dark hints, that, con&s;idering the revengeful temper of Mr. Montalbert, it would be well if &s;omething wor&s;e than being &s;pirited away had not befallen the poor young man.</P>
<P>"All this I heard with alternate angui&s;h and depre&s;&s;ion, of which it would be difficult to con|vey any idea to another. The fatal predilection that I had for Orm&s;by was then known, for no other rea&s;on could be given for &s;uch conduct to|wards him as was imputed to my father. I now &s;aw none of the neighbours, for of the very few who had been accu&s;tomed to vi&s;it at the hou&s;e, not one at this time approached it, and as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be|lieved curio&s;ity would have prompted them to

come if they had no other motive, I thought it certain that my father had taken mea&s;ures to prevent their vi&s;its. This I was not di&s;plea&s;ed at, for <HI>their</HI> looks would have been more unea&s;y to me than were tho&s;e of the &s;ervants; whenever I &s;aw any of <HI>them</HI> I was covered with confu&s;ion, and fancied they would remark and account for the &s;ad change in my face and figure, of which I could not fail to be my&s;elf con&s;cious.</P>
<P>"But if I fled thus from the ob&s;ervation of &s;ervants, what was my fear when compelled to appear before the &s;evere and &s;crutini&s;ing eyes of my father?&mdash;I had always an awe approaching to dread of him, even in tho&s;e comparatively happy days when no reproaches of con&s;cience a&s;&s;ailed me. . . . . Now I endeavoured to attend on him with the &s;ame a&s;&s;iduity as I u&s;ed to do before Orm&s;by became a &s;harer in the ta&s;k, or rather undertook it entirely; but whether it was that my timidity made me aukward, and that, therefore, I was incapable of acquitting my&s;elf as I formerly did, or whether my father, more really angry than he cho&s;e to avow, took the&s;e occa&s;ions to vent in peevi&s;hne&s;s &s;ome part of the re&s;entment and indignation he felt. Certain it is, that his har&s;hne&s;s and a&s;perity were almo&s;t in&s;up|portable, and the unkind expre&s;&s;ions he &s;ometimes u&s;ed, the looks of rage and di&s;dain he ca&s;t upon me, were not unfrequently &s;uch as affected my &s;pirits &s;o much as to throw me into fainting fits, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which I reproached my poor Helene for re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng me. . . .

and I know not what would have been the con&s;e|quence of &s;uch a &s;eries of pre&s;ent &s;uffering, added to the dread of the future, had they continued much longer.</P>
<P>"Yet before the return of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, to which only I looked forward with the lea&s;t hope of mitigating my woes, I had &s;ome trials of fortitude to encounter more difficult to &s;u&s;tain than any I had yet experienced.</P>
<P>"At the end of a long row of elms, of which now a few &s;ingle trees only remain, you recollect a high mount now planted with firs, poplars, and larches, into which, as it is railed round, nobo|dy now enters; you perhaps remember too, the very large yew tree that &s;hadows a great &s;pace of ground near it, and which is al&s;o railed round. That mound covers the ruins of a &s;mall pari&s;h church, and that yew tree was in the church|yard.</P>
<P>"An avenue of ancient trees was terminated by this church, at the di&s;tance of &s;omething more than a quarter of a mile from the hou&s;e. It was merely the chancel of a larger edifice which had belonged to a mona&s;tery, &s;ome of the ruins of which remained &s;cattered over the ground, and when I and my brother were children, we had been told by the &s;ervants many of tho&s;e legends that almo&s;t always belong to &s;uch places. It was &s;aid too among them, that beneath the&s;e ve&s;tiges of buildings, which were not con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ble above the ground, there were arched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, which formerly &s;erv|ed as burial places for the religious per&s;ons of
<PB N="211" REF="029524_0213_0FE1D5DB791B9160">
this mona&s;tery. Their coffins, placed in niches along the walls, had been formerly &s;een by &s;eve|ral per&s;ons, who had given a very terrific ac|count of the &s;keletons in the&s;e di&s;mal rece&s;&s;es; accounts which were now traditional in the neighbouring villages, and were of cour&s;e greatly exaggerated.&mdash;The mournful relics that had been &s;een under the earth were imagined to vi&s;it its &s;urface, and the place was univer&s;ally believed to be haunted. The &s;tyle of the building that remained, where light was admitted through long windows ob&s;cured by pieces of coloured gla&s;s, and now darkened by the ivy that mantled almo&s;t the whole edifice; the walls of great thickne&s;s, in &s;ome places green with the damps that continually &s;treamed from the roof, in others marked with the remains of Latin &s;entences, &s;ur|rounding the half-effaced repre&s;entations of the crucifixion, all contributed to give an air of wild|ne&s;s and horror to this almo&s;t-de&s;erted building; where, though at the Reformation, as it is called, under Henry the Eighth, it became a pari&s;h church, yet &s;ervice was performed in it only once a year, as a mere matter of form, for the pari&s;h contained only the hou&s;e of Holmwood, and three cottages belonging to my father, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pulled down. So that when it was his plea&s;ure to de&s;troy this &s;mall church entirely, and unite the pari&s;h it belonged to with another, there were none to oppo&s;e the act of parliament he &s;oli|cited and obtained for that purpo&s;e.

which naturally gives ri&s;e to the reports of &s;uper|natural appearances; there was not a &s;ervant who would on any account have gone thither of a night, and even the gardeners and workmen, who were at any time occupied near it, related &s;trange &s;tories of uncommon noi&s;es, as of mourn|ing and complaint, and more than once have ran in terror to their fellow labourers, declaring that &s;ome ob&s;cure figures had i&s;&s;ued from the vaults beneath, and then melted into air.</P>
<P>"Such was the &s;tern &s;pirit of my father, and he &s;o little knew how to make allowances for any weakne&s;s which he had never felt, that had any dome&s;tic betrayed fears of this &s;ort before him, they would have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with di&s;grace, nor did my brother and I, while children, though we knew all the legends of the country, ever dare &s;peak to him of the &s;tories we had been taught. Thus compelled to &s;tifle our infantine fears, they were gradually &s;ubdued as our rea&s;on became &s;tronger; and <HI>we</HI> were accu&s;tomed not only to find our way in the dark all over the exten&s;ive old buildings of Holmwood, but to traver&s;e without fear the avenue that led to, and even the area that &s;urrounded, the ruined church, though we credited the probable account that in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beneath re&s;ted the remains of the former inhabi|tants of the decayed mona&s;tery.</P>

<P>"The intelligence I had received on this par|ticular evening from Mr. Hayward, that he had heard Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington would be at home in two or three days, had given &s;ome relief to my &s;pirits, and, rather le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;&s;ed than u&s;ual, I &s;trolled almo&s;t mechanically up the avenues.

<P>"The well-known objects around me were becoming indi&s;tinct, but I continued to walk &s;lowly on&mdash;I even &s;at down for a few moments on the remains of a ru&s;tic tomb, and li&s;tened to the dull &s;ighing of the wind as it &s;ung round the but|tre&s;&s;es, and waved the black boughs of the old yew tree.

In my &s;olitary and gloomy walks, however, I &s;aw no more any object like that which had before alarmed me, nor did I hear any noi&s;e but &s;uch as I could ea&s;i|ly account for.

<P>"But imagine, my Ro&s;alie, if it be po&s;&s;ible, imagine what I &s;uffered, when, about five days after the circum&s;tance of my finding the letter, I was alarmed by the &s;udden entrance of Helene into my room, who breathle&s;s with &s;ome new ter|ror, endeavoured to explain &s;omething, which it was long before I under&s;tood. At length I made out, that a neighbouring gentleman in the com|mi&s;&s;ion was come, as the &s;ervants believed, to ap|prehend my father with peace officers, for that a regular complaint had been laid, it was not known by whom, of the &s;udden di&s;appearance of Orm&s;|by; and at length the accu&s;ation of having mur|dered him had been &s;o often repeated, and the clamours of the country, where certainly my fa|ther had many enemies, had become &s;o loud, that the gentleman in que&s;tion could act no otherwi&s;e than he did.</P>

dreadful command I had received, &s;till vibrated in my ears: and the horrors of my fate were &s;o forcibly pre&s;ented to my mind, that the few di&s;|tinct thoughts that pa&s;&s;ed through it pointed to &s;uicide as the only way to e&s;cape from a de&s;tiny I was utterly unable to &s;upport. At length the tears and prayers of my faithful Helene re&s;tored to me &s;ome degree of recollection. She knelt at my feet, imploring me to have mercy on my&s;elf and on my infant, and to exert my&s;elf, if it were only to &s;ave my &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the crimes to which his furious revenge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht excite him.

<P>"Though I knew great part of this rea&s;oning was fallacious, I affected to be more calm, that Helene who would not be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, might talk to me no longer.

the avenue, and &s;tood a moment looking at the half-ruined church, and meditating on the horri|ble idea taken up by the people of the country, that Orm&s;by was de&s;troyed and buried is this place. . . . . What an opinion mu&s;t they have of the violence and ferocity of my father's &s;pirit! What an idea of the provocation he had received before they could have &s;uppo&s;ed him likely to be driven to extremities &s;o dangerous and dreadful! &mdash;It was impo&s;&s;ible but the cau&s;e for &s;uch ven|geance mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pected.

<P>"Many were the conferences we now had; but probably it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;aved me from that death, which my fa|ther might have thought could alone wipe away the di&s;honour I had brought upon his family, had not providence interfered in my favour.</P>
<P>"Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington now met and conver&s;ed with George Orm&s;by. They agreed that the only means of &s;aving his brother was to procure his renunciation of every preten&s;ion to me in what|ever form my father &s;hould dictate. This I alone could engage him to do; and this at length Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington extorted from me in a few lines, by which I <HI>asked</HI> this of him. With a trembling hand, and eyes overflowing with tears, I &s;igned the fatal paper. Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington a&s;&s;ured me, that George Orm&s;by went immediately with it to
<PB N="232" REF="029524_0234_0FE1D5B29AC418B8">
London.&mdash;In about ten days afterwards, Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, who remained at Holmwood, inform|ed me &s;he had heard from him; that his brother Charles was relea&s;ed, and on his voyage to India. There was &s;omething in all this that I could not comprehend; but I dared not tru&s;t my&s;elf either with inquiries or conjectures&mdash;Orm&s;by was lo&s;t to me for ever; and I, &s;ometimes in the bitter|ne&s;s of my &s;oul, accu&s;ed him of having abandoned me, though, in more rea&s;onable moments, I was compelled to acknowledge that his &s;tay would have been de&s;tructive to us both. . . . . . My father, who, as it appeared from his conduct, knew much of the truth, though the lo&s;s of my honour was yet unknown to him, became &s;ome|what le&s;s &s;evere towards me. Yet I &s;hrunk more than ever from his eye, and my timidity and ter|ror mu&s;t have betrayed me, if the change in my per&s;on, now every day more evident, could have e&s;caped ob&s;ervation; but whether it was that the violence of temper, which my father had yielded to in regard to Orm&s;by, had aggravated his athri|tic complaints, or whether his con&s;titution was entirely breaking up, he became at this period &s;o ill, that a phy&s;ician, who had always &s;ucce&s;sfully attended him, was &s;ent for from London; he gave him &s;ome relief, but declared, that unle&s;s he went to town, where con&s;tant attendance could be given him, the con&s;equence would be greatly to be apprehended.</P>
<P>"The re&s;ult of this advice was, that we re|moved to London. Thither al&s;o my friends Mr. and Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington removed. And Mrs Le&s;|&s;ington
<PB N="233" REF="029524_0235_0FE1D600A01D9A78">
being then near her time, it was &s;o managed, that when the hour arrived when you, my beloved child, came into the world, you were concealed by Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington for three weeks, and then produced as twin with the daughter of which &s;he was delivered, who is &s;ince dead.</P>
<P>"You may imagine, my Ro&s;alie, how very difficult it was to conceal the fatal &s;ecret of your birth&mdash;you may imagine, for I cannot de&s;cribe, what were the terrors I had to encounter&mdash;the angui&s;h of heart with which, when I had once beheld you, once pre&s;&s;ed you to my heart, I &s;aw you torn from me, and knew that I &s;hould never dare to call you mine, or again to &s;hed over you the tears excited by the re&s;emblance your infant features bore to tho&s;e of your father.</P>
<P>"But, on calmer reflection, I agreed with Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, who repre&s;ented to me ince&s;|&s;antly, how thankful I ought to be for the good fortune with which I had &s;aved my reputation, if not my life. The &s;u&s;picions that had been enter|tained, in con&s;equence of my father's violent conduct towards Orm&s;by, were now, &s;he &s;aid, blown over and forgotten.

I was not however, the le&s;s mi&s;erable, though I owned the truth of all Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington urged; and whenever I was alone, I gave way to that angui&s;h of heart, which, while I was with her, I endeavoured to repre&s;s or conceal, becau&s;e I would not be thought ungrateful, or in&s;en&s;ible of the obligations I owed to her friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>"During my father's very &s;evere illne&s;s, I heard no more of Mr. Vyvian. Indeed I &s;eldom &s;aw my father, and when it was unavoidable, only for a few minutes. Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, in whom he had great confidence, and expre&s;&s;ed a regard unu&s;ual for him to feel, had contrived to obtain his leave for me to &s;tay with her while &s;he was very ill and unable to come to me; and by this management only it was that I e&s;caped ob|&s;ervation at the period when I could &s;o little bear it. As my father recovered, however, my more con&s;tant attendance was again nece&s;&s;ary. He now &s;ometimes ordered me to read to him, and, when he was &s;till more at ea&s;e, to play at che&s;s with him. I was, indeed, but a poor &s;ub&s;titute for Orm&s;by or Mr. Hayward; but I fancied that the latter &s;ometimes got out of the way, as if on purpo&s;e to make me more nece&s;&s;ary to my father, and to leave us together.</P>
<P>"It was in one of the&s;e tete-a-tete parties, that my father, without much ceremony or much preface, a&s;ked me, whether I had reflected on what he had determined upon in regard to Mr. Vyvian, who would now in a fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> days be in

<P>"The violent effect of this intelligence was evident on my countenance. I tried in vain to &s;peak. My lips refu&s;ed to articulate a &s;yllable. Not only di&s;regarding but enraged at the pain I &s;eemed to feel, he declared in a voice that made me tremble like a leaf, that if I did not de|termine to obey without remon&s;trance, or he&s;ita|tion, he knew how to puni&s;h, and <HI>would</HI> puni&s;h me as I de&s;erved.

<P>"My friend Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, however, and the Abbe Hayward, joined in this cruel per&s;ecu|tion. The former removed you from my &s;ight

entirely, and &s;ent you into the country. The latter &s;eemed to have lo&s;t his u&s;ual humanity and tenderne&s;s, and to think that duty, which I had once violated, had now &s;tronger claims upon me than before the fatal indi&s;cretion I had been guilty of. From your father I heard nothing. His family reported every where that he was married to a woman of fortune, with whom he became acquainted on her voyage to India, whither &s;he was &s;ent for by an uncle, who&s;e heire&s;s &s;he was. This I believed, as I had done many other &s;tories that were among the artifices that were u&s;ed to force me into this dete&s;ted marriage. They &s;uc|ceeded but too well, or rather the extreme terror I had of my father left me no means of e&s;cape. I became then the wife of Mr. Vyvian. I have been ever &s;ince the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of women; my &s;on only, and the con&s;olation of having &s;a|crificed my&s;elf to duty, alone &s;upported me. Before, however, I was driven into this mi&s;era|ble union, I executed, as I was then of age, a deed of gift, in which I made over, during my life, to Mr. and Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, the intere&s;t of four thou&s;and pounds, which was the gift of a relation, and which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed independent of my father, but without the power of alienating the principal. This is part of the money which Mr. Vyvian has &s;o often reproached me with <HI>wasting,</HI> as he terms it, on begging monks and canting hypocrites; though, had I really be&s;tow|ed it on my nece&s;&s;itous fellow creatures, I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf well ju&s;tified in &s;uch a di&s;|po&s;al of it.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="029524_0239_0FE1D603D93552C8">"I had not been married above fifteen months when my father died, and left Mr. Vyvian in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fortune, which was undoubtedly his chief motive for overlooking my reluctance which I repeatedly avowed to him, and which he well knew accompanied me to the altar. After my father's death, he no longer affected to treat me with the lea&s;t regard. We went abroad for &s;ome years, which &s;erved in &s;ome mea&s;ure to relieve and di&s;&s;ipate the heavine&s;s of my heart. I had often the con&s;olation of hearing from Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington: and in her letters, with the account &s;he gave me of her family, my Ro&s;alie, as one of that family, was always mentioned. When I returned to England, I found you, child of my fond affections, all that my fancy could form of loveline&s;s and perfection. So many tears had my fatal error co&s;t me, and &s;o much, I hoped, had been expiated by the &s;ub&s;equent &s;acrifice I made&punc; that I tru&s;ted it was not criminal to indulge my|&s;elf with a &s;ight of you.

<P>AT home and alone Ro&s;alie had time to re|flect on the &s;tory &s;he had heard; and though &s;he knew very little of the world, and Mrs. Vyvian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> failed to be very minute in many parts of her &s;tory, it &s;eemed certain that the family of Mr. Orm&s;by had been the principal in&s;truments in ter|rifying her into a marriage, which would have rendered her life mi&s;erable even if her heart and her per&s;on had not belonged to another.

Their motives were probably good; but Ro&s;alie could not help reflecting, that had not &s;uch been their conduct, &s;he might now have been the acknowledged daughter of the mo&s;t tender and affectionate of mothers; &s;he might have known and been ble&s;&s;ed by the fondne&s;s and protection of her father; and they might in a happy union have effaced the remembrance of their early indi&s;cretion; for the death of Mr. Montalbert would &s;oon have left his daughter at liberty: and her life would not have been pa&s;&s;ed in the mi&s;eries of &s;uch a marriage, nor her &s;pirits have been overwhelmed with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being the wife of one man while her whole heart was another's.

The aver&s;ion that Barbara Vyvian &s;eemed to have to her was even greater than that of Mrs. Bo&s;worth; and on recollecting &s;everal circum&s;tances that had happened &s;ince the e&s;trangement the &s;i&s;ters had &s;hewn towards her, Ro&s;alie could not but imagine that they knew, or &s;u&s;pected, her near relation&s;hip to their mother. . . . . . . . Ingenuous and liberal as her own heart was, &s;he imagined not that it was po&s;&s;ible for envy only, malignant hatred of &s;uperior excellence and beauty, to call forth the ill-humour and provoke the ill offices of the&s;e young women, though &s;he had already had a &s;pecimen of the effect of tho&s;e odious pa&s;&s;ions in the behaviour of the Mi&s;s Le&s;|&s;ingtons, whom &s;he once thought her &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>In this family &s;he now &s;eemed to be almo&s;t a &s;tranger. The character of Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, &s;ince the death of her hu&s;band, &s;eemed totally changed; and her pa&s;&s;ion for cards, and for the &s;ociety of the &s;et of people among whom &s;he now lived, ab&s;orbed almo&s;t every other feeling but her pa&s;&s;ion for money. To Ro&s;alie &s;he was not only become perfectly indifferent; but &s;eemed weary of the ta&s;k of affecting &s;entiments &s;he did not feel. From the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Mrs. Vyvian, it was probable &s;he would never be able to increa&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al gift &s;he had made as a con&s;ideration for

adopting her daughter, and her former and long attachment to her, &s;eemed, if not entirely forgot|ten, at lea&s;t in&s;ufficient now to urge her to any exertions of friend&s;hip and attention. She &s;eldom &s;aw Mrs. Vyvian, and, when &s;he did, her con|ver&s;ation related entirely to people with whom the latter held no intercour&s;e, and her vi&s;it ap|peared to be always a matter of ceremony rather than of choi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Though the &s;olitude in which Ro&s;alie was left, was infinitely the mo&s;t plea&s;ing circum&s;tance of her pre&s;ent re&s;idence, yet &s;he could not but imagine that the &s;tyle in which &s;he was treated in the family mu&s;t occa&s;ion &s;u&s;picions of the truth. The difficulties of concealing for a &s;eries of years &s;uch a &s;ecret, appeared the more wonderful the longer &s;he thought of it. But, from the&s;e meditations on the extraordinary e|vents Mrs. Vyvian had related to her, &s;he re|covered her&s;elf only to reflect on what was to be her future fate. Her mother had been abandoned by the man to whom &s;he had &s;acrificed her honor and her peace. And though probably it was to pre&s;erve her life and his own that this &s;eparation had been &s;ubmitted to, though it was certain that compul&s;ion had at fir&s;t been u&s;ed to bring about this cruel &s;eparation, and that rea&s;on and a re&s;pect for the object of his unfortunate love had after|wards prevented Mr. Orm&s;by from making any attempt to write to her, Ro&s;alie could not think, without extreme pain, that even <HI>such</HI> an attach|ment was not proof again&s;t time and ab&s;ence. Mrs. Vyvian had &s;aid, that &s;he believed that though Orm&s;by &s;till lived, he had forgotten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="243" REF="029524_0245_0FE1D60F2242B8B0">

She added, that &s;he mo&s;t &s;incerely <HI>hoped he had;</HI> but, as &s;he &s;aid this&punc; her tears fell more abundantly, and her heart &s;eemed to feel all the bitterne&s;s that attends the conviction of being forgotten by tho&s;e we have fondly loved. Ro&s;alie thought that nothing could ever induce her even to <HI>say,</HI> that &s;he wi&s;hed to be forgotten by Montalbert.</P>
<P>It was now &s;ome weeks &s;ince &s;he had heard from him. There had even been time for an an|&s;wer to Mrs. Vyvian's le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r.

<P>When &s;he &s;aw her mother in the morning, it was with increa&s;ed concern &s;he ob&s;erved the deep dejection into which Mrs. Vyvian had &s;unk. The little &s;trength which &s;he had collected to enable her to relate to Ro&s;alie what it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould know, was now exhau&s;ted: and pale and languid, &s;he appeared to &s;u&s;tain with difficulty the fatigue of leaving her bed to receive her daughters, who were to be with her at noon: the one to take leave of her again for &s;ome time, the other to become a re&s;ident in a hou&s;e which offered &s;cenes &s;o different from tho&s;e to which &s;he had long been accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>As the &s;ight of Ro&s;alie &s;eemed rather more deeply to affect than to relieve her mother, &s;he &s;hortened her vi&s;it, and returned to her u&s;ual home, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the day entirely alone;

<P>In the evening &s;he &s;at down to write to Mon|talbert, and had nearly fini&s;hed her letter, when a maid (for there were only two female &s;ervants in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;e) came to tell her, that there was a per&s;on at the gate who de&s;ired to &s;peak to her; who, upon her a&s;king his bu&s;ine&s;s, an&s;wered that he could communicate it only to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>As Ro&s;alie had no acquaintance likely to make &s;uch a vi&s;it, nor any bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act, and as &s;o nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> London there is always danger of admitting &s;trangers, &s;he bid the &s;ervant tell him, &s;he could &s;peak to no per&s;on with who&s;e name and purpo&s;e &s;he was unacquainted. The girl &s;taid &s;ome time, and then returned with a piece of paper, on which was written with a pencil, "Be not alarmed. It is Montalbert, who, compelled to return in &s;ecret, has been to Mrs. Vyvian's, and finds per&s;ons with her before whom it is im|po&s;&s;ible for him to appear."</P>
<P>The mingled joy and &s;urpri&s;e, not without &s;ome alloy of fear, with which Ro&s;alie read this, may be ea&s;ily imagined.

When they were calm enough to conver&s;e upon it, he told her, that as &s;oon as he had rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Mrs. Vyvian's letter, he determined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> over him&s;elf to England at every hazard.&mdash; It

was not very ea&s;y," &s;aid he, "to prevail on my mother, who has, unluckily for me, projects in her head for e&s;tabli&s;hing my fortune, which made her more unwilling to allow of my ab&s;ence. But a young Sicilian nobleman, with whom I was brought up, and who is di&s;tantly related to my mother, was exactly at that period returning to Sicily for a few months. I communicated my di&s;tre&s;s to him, and he managed the difficulty &s;o well, that I obtained a &s;hort leave of ab&s;ence, and am now &s;uppo&s;ed to be with him in Sicily. A thou&s;and circum&s;tances may happen to betray me. But I tru&s;t much to the friend&s;hip and prevoyance of my friend to guard again&s;t detection at pre&s;ent; and, for the future, I know my Ro&s;alie will not &s;hrink from any trial of that affection which makes the happine&s;s of my exi&s;tence&mdash;even though a greater &s;acrifice were required of her than to quit her pre&s;ent abode."</P>
<P>The an&s;wer that Ro&s;alie gave to this was, that with him every place and every country would be equally plea&s;ant to her. He then explained to her his views.&mdash;"Unable to live without you," &s;aid he, "I have never cea&s;ed, &s;ince I have been in Italy, to meditate on the means of conciliating my happine&s;s, and the deference I owe my mo|ther. That friend, of whom I have ju&s;t been &s;peaking, is now ma&s;ter of his fortune. He has offered me a &s;mall, but beautiful villa in Sicily, about &s;even miles from Me&s;&s;ina, and not more than two and a half from the &s;ea. There you may live, my Ro&s;alie, unremarked and unque&s;|tioned; and there I can pa&s;s months with you,

without incurring, on the part of my mother, any &s;u&s;picion, or any other remon&s;trance, than mu&s;t in every event ari&s;e from my refu&s;al of the match &s;he wi&s;hes to make for me. When, how|ever, &s;he finds I am determined, and lo&s;es her apprehen&s;ions of my forming &s;ome attachment to an Engli&s;h-woman and a Prote&s;tant, I &s;hall be left at liberty to wander about Italy occa&s;ionally as I u&s;ed to do: and we may be happy at the pre&s;ent with each other, without ri&s;king the lo&s;s of that pro&s;perity hereafter, in which it is the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart to place you."</P>
<P>This plan appeared to Ro&s;alie not only practi|cable, but delightful. The unfeigned plea&s;ure with which &s;he embraced it &s;eemed to redouble the &s;atisfaction with which Montalbert expatiated on their future pro&s;pects. He appeared, indeed, to have thought of every thing, and &s;ettled what &s;hould be &s;aid to per&s;ons in England, to account for her departure. It was to be given out, that Mrs. Vyvian had procured for her a &s;ituation in a foreign family of di&s;tinction, who were de&s;irous of having a young Engli&s;hwoman as in&s;tructre&s;s to their daughters; an e&s;tabli&s;hment, which, as Ro&s;alie Le&s;&s;ington was left entirely without for|tune, was extremely advantageous and de&s;irable. &mdash;However improbable &s;uch an arrangement might appear to tho&s;e who were acquainted with Italian cu&s;toms and manners, Ro&s;alie and Montal|bert agreed, that there were none of that de&s;crip|tion among tho&s;e who were likely to inquire of the Le&s;&s;ington family; &s;he had appeared, indeed, &s;o little in their &s;ocieties, that it was probable &s;he would &s;oon be wholly forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="029524_0249_0FE1BAB9B7A46280">Mrs. Bo&s;worth and Mi&s;s Vyvian were certainly more likely to inquire after her with more active malignity, and, doubting any &s;tory that was at all unlikely, to form conjectures to her di&s;advan|tage. But, as the journey of Montalbert, at this period, was unknown to them, as they had no communication with the Le&s;&s;ington family, and were both too proud to annex any con&s;equence to Ro&s;alie, except what &s;he had derived from their fears of their brother's or their mother's too great affection for her, it was probable that when they &s;aw her, and heard of her no more, they would cea&s;e to think about her.</P>
<P>It was, however, a very inconvenient circum|&s;tance to them, that the pre&s;ence of Barbara Vy|vian prevented Montalbert's &s;eeing her mother, with whom it was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for him to con&s;ult. As he could not &s;tay more than a week in Eng|land, there was not a moment to lo&s;e. Many purcha&s;es were to be made for Ro&s;alie, as well as many precautions to be taken; and it was proper that Mrs. Vyvian and Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington &s;hould meet to adju&s;t &s;everal points relative to a per&s;on in whom both were intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>After &s;ome debate how to obtain admittance to Mrs. Vyvian, it was agreed that this could be done only by the means of Mr. Hayward. To him, therefore, Montalbert immediately wrote, engaging him to meet him at a tavern early the following morning. Then reluctantly, and not without her repeating her remon&s;trances on the impropriety of his &s;taying any longer, he took leave of Ro&s;alie, and retired for the night to the
<PB N="248" REF="029524_0250_0FE1D618E03BEC30">
hou&s;e, where, in pur&s;uance of his appointment, Mr. Hayward came to him the next day at &s;ix o'clock.</P>
<P>They together contrived &s;o well, that Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington was admitted to the apartment of her friend without any &s;u&s;picion on the part of Mi&s;s Vyvian; and in a few days every nece&s;&s;ary ar|rangement was made, and Ro&s;alie ready to de|part.</P>
<P>There were in England only two per&s;ons, of whom to take leave for &s;o long a time, perhaps for ever, gave her &s;evere pain. The&s;e were her real mother, for whom her affection &s;eemed to be greater than if &s;he had been accu&s;tomed always to con&s;ider her in that endearing relation&s;hip, and the elde&s;t Mr. Le&s;&s;ington, from whom &s;he had for &s;o many years received in&s;truction, and to|wards whom &s;he had been u&s;ed to look for future protection and regard. To him, however, &s;he could have no opportunity of &s;aying farewel, as he was gone into Wales with a young man of for|tune, from whom he had expectations of prefer|ment. Ro&s;alie dared not even write to him, as Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, object|ed to it; &s;he was compelled, therefore, to go without bidding him adieu.</P>
<P>Her parting with her mother was attended with many tears on both &s;ides; but each wi&s;hed to &s;horten a painful &s;cene, which it was not &s;afe long to continue, as Ro&s;alie and Montalbert were introduced into the hou&s;e by &s;tealth. This &s;ad farewel being over, they got into a hackney <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch with their baggage, and being &s;et dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an

<P>THE fatigue of travelling, and the &s;uffering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, were rendered &s;upportable to Ro&s;alie by every care and attention which vigi|lant love could dictate. Having recovered from the latter, and wondered at the novelty which a French town pre&s;ents to one who never before cro&s;&s;ed the channel, the travellers proceeded, after a few days re&s;t, to Paris, and from thence to Lyons. Ro&s;alie, though delighted with her journey, and acquiring new ideas at every &s;tep, was impatient to proceed, becau&s;e &s;he dreaded nothing &s;o much as that the mother of Montal|bert &s;hould di&s;cover, by his protracted &s;tay, that
<PB N="250" REF="029524_0252_0FE1D61A7B258290">
he had been to England; while he, more &s;olicit|ous for the health of his lovely wife, than influ|enced by any other motive, regulated his journey rather by her convenience, than by the nece&s;&s;ity of appearing in proper time from his &s;uppo&s;ed Sicilian voyage, leaving to his friend, the Count of &mdash;, the care of keeping up appearances for him as well as he could.</P>
<P>Had not apprehen&s;ions of what might happen to embitter his future felicity a little derogated from the enjoyment of the pre&s;ent, it would have been difficult to have found a happier being than Montalbert. While he pointed out to Ro&s;alie the beauty of the country through which they were pa&s;&s;ing, every &s;cene, every view, &s;eemed to acquire new charms. The plea&s;ure which the varied pro&s;pects of nature gave to her young and unadulterated heart, the de&s;ire of information &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, and the &s;en&s;e and &s;olidity of her re|marks, communicated to him delight more ex|qui&s;ite than that which he felt in contemplating the beauty of her form and face, which he could not but ob&s;erve, attracted univer&s;al admiration wherever &s;he appeared, even in the ha&s;te of a journey, and under the few advantages of a tra|velling dre&s;s.</P>
<P>In France, &s;uperior or even common beauty is generally much noticed; and almo&s;t at every po&s;t town Montalbert heard &s;ome ob&s;ervation on the loveline&s;s of <HI>la jeune Anglaise:</HI> or, if they remained in any city more than a day, had an attempt made by &s;ome gay young man or other to be introduced to his notice.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="029524_0253_0FE1D641904A45D8">From the&s;e &s;ort of acquaintance, however, Montalbert &s;hrunk, with a &s;en&s;ibility unu&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions to his natural character, which was open, un&s;u&s;picious, and &s;ociable. He not unfrequently was &s;en&s;ible of &s;omething like jea|lou&s;y, for which he failed not to rea&s;on with him&s;elf. But &s;till his di&s;like of the adulation which he &s;aw likely to be offered to his wife, wherever &s;he appeared, conquered the &s;en&s;e he had of the ab&s;urdity of feeling &s;uch a &s;entiment in regard to her, who was all innocence and &s;impli|city; who certainly lived but to plea&s;e him, and was &s;o uncon&s;cious of her per&s;onal attractions as not to have the lea&s;t idea of the rea&s;ons which made him avoid every &s;ort of &s;ociety on the road. She imputed his &s;hunning it, to the fear he had, le&s;t he &s;hould be met by &s;ome of his former ac|quaintance, who might betray to his mother his pre&s;ent expedition.&mdash;There was, however, in this re&s;erve of Montalbert's le&s;s of per&s;onal jea|lou&s;y than of another &s;entiment. The mind of Ro&s;alie, unadulterated by the fal&s;e refinements of modern education, and yet new to the world, &s;eemed, to her hu&s;band, capable of being adorned with all that lends grace to beauty, and gives perfection to genius. She had &s;een &s;o little of &s;ociety &s;ince her &s;hort re&s;idence near London, that the bloom of the mind (if &s;uch an expre&s;|&s;ion may be allowed) had not been tarni&s;hed by any commerce with inferior &s;ociety, or the com|mon &s;tudies of a circulating library. Her natu|ral under&s;tanding was excellent: and &s;he had more judgment than generally attends on &s;o much
<PB N="252" REF="029524_0254_0FE1D61C1AAEA0A0">
genius as &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but hitherto this judg|ment had been unexerci&s;ed, and this genius dor|mant.</P>
<P>The little &s;he had read was but ill-calculated to form the fir&s;t: and the &s;ociety &s;he had been u&s;ually among, had allowed her little &s;cope for the latter. But, at a very early period of her life &s;he became con&s;cious, that &s;uch &s;ort of peo|ple as &s;he was u&s;ually thrown among, people who only e&s;cape from dullne&s;s by flying to defamation, were extremely tire&s;ome to her, though &s;he &s;aw that nobody el&s;e thought &s;o, and &s;u&s;pected her&s;elf of being fa&s;tidious and perver&s;e. The cold, and &s;ometimes contemptuous treatment &s;he had met with from her &s;uppo&s;ed &s;i&s;ters, the little real affection &s;he had ever found from the per&s;ons whom &s;he believed to be her parents, had render|ed her timid and diffident.&mdash;As nobody but Mrs. Vyvian &s;eemed to love her, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that to none but Mrs. Vyvian &s;he &s;eemed worthy of affection. Since the explanation that had been given, all the pa&s;&s;ages of her former life appeared in a new light: and &s;he accounted for the indif|ference of her &s;uppo&s;ed, and the tenderne&s;s of her real, parent.</P>
<P>This extraordinary di&s;covery was a frequent topic of conver&s;ation between her and Montal|bert as they pur&s;ued on their journey: and they often canva&s;&s;ed the circum&s;tances that would, if the narrative of Mrs. Vyvian had been le&s;s au|thenticated, have given ri&s;e to incredulity.&mdash; Montalbert, when he fir&s;t heard it from Ro&s;alie, had remarked the&s;e circum&s;tances&mdash;"It is

&s;trange" &s;aid he "that the account you have giv|en of your father's pre&s;ent &s;ituation is &s;o vague, &s;o indi&s;tinct, that you have no clue to guide you even to the certainty of his exi&s;tence, none by which you can identify your&s;elf to him. I can make every allowance for the &s;ingular circum&s;tan|ces in which Mrs. Vyvian was placed; for the timidity of her temper, and for the violence of my grandfather, whom I have always heard re|pre&s;ented as a tyrant, who was not to be, would not be, contradicted. Still it appears equally un|fortunate and &s;trange, that &s;he omitted to tell you whether he knew of your birth? whether the fa|mily of Orm&s;by were appri&s;ed of it?"</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e remarks, the ju&s;tice of which &s;he however acknowledged, Ro&s;alie bade him recollect, how much of all the circum&s;tances mo&s;t interre&s;ting to her might be unknown, even to Mrs. Vyvian her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"When I remember" &s;aid &s;he "the counte|nance and manner of my mother, when &s;he re|called tho&s;e &s;cenes in which &s;he &s;uffered &s;o cruel|ly, when I think how little capable &s;he was, even at this di&s;tance of time, of dwelling on tho&s;e parts of her &s;tory, where &s;he had occa&s;ion to name my unfortunate father, and the awe &s;he had of her own, as well as the tyranny &s;he had &s;ince experi|enced from Mr. Vyvian, and the nece&s;&s;ity there has ever been for &s;ecrecy as to a part of her for|mer life, which would undoubtedly have aggra|vated her actual &s;orrows, I cannot wonder, though, perhaps, I may have occa&s;ion to lament the incomplete information this dear unhappy pa|rent

has given me. . . . . I have &s;een her lips tremble, and cold and death-like dew on her temples, while, in a languid voice, &s;he was re|lating what I have repeated to you; and I know that no motives le&s;s powerful than her love and her fears for me could have engaged her to write as &s;he did to you. Long years of &s;orrow have &s;o broken her &s;pirits, that the mo&s;t gloomy ideas &s;ometimes take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind; &s;he trem|bles, le&s;t incidents in her life, for which &s;urely &s;he has already been puni&s;hed &s;ufficiently, &s;hould &s;till draw the anger of Heaven on her children, as well as hazard her future happine&s;s. She thinks, that &s;he &s;hould not have deceived Mr. Vyvian; though, had &s;he not done &s;o, there is no imagin|ing what might have been the con&s;equence from the furious temper of her father; and the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of having done &s;o has made her patiently &s;ubmit to every unworthy treatment&mdash;offering" to u&s;e her own pathetic phra&s;e "her &s;ufferings as a &s;acrifice to the God whom &s;he had offended, and hoping their bitterne&s;s and duration might expi|ate the errors of her early life.&mdash;From hence I ac|count for many parts of my mother's conduct," continued Ro&s;alie, "that before appeared my&s;te|rious&mdash;her &s;evere penances, her voluntary re&s;ig|nation of the world&mdash;and her patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the undutiful and even cruel conduct of her daughters. And from the pains the&s;e ladies took to alarm her about their brother's attachment to me, though ignorant of all the agonies they were inflicting, I have an explanation of that forced and involuntary neglect of me, which rendered
<PB N="255" REF="029524_0257_0FE1D64B585606B8">
me &s;o very wretched for &s;ome time, and of which I am per&s;uaded nothing but this cruel idea could have induced her to a&s;&s;ume even the appear|ance."</P>
<P>Montalbert li&s;tened &s;ilently to this natural and &s;en&s;ible vindication of conduct, which appeared to him more extraordinary and le&s;s accountable than it did to Ro&s;alie. He thought it, indeed, almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that Mr. Vyvian &s;hould be &s;o ignorant of his wife's former attachment as he &s;eemed to be; and he was &s;ure that her father had known, if not all, yet &s;o much of the truth, as had induced him to act in concert with Orm&s;|by's family, or at lea&s;t to compel them &s;o to act with him as to have &s;aved his daughter's reputa|tion at the expence of her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject was frequently renewed during the progre&s;s of their journey: and the tears of Ro&s;alie as often flowed from the recollection of the &s;ad &s;tate of &s;pirits and health in which &s;he had left her mother. So great were Mrs. Vyvian's apprehen&s;ions of any accident, that might di&s;cover the &s;ecret &s;o long cheri&s;hed like a &s;erpent in her bo&s;om, that &s;he had de&s;ired Ro&s;alie and Montalbert not to write to her on the way; thus depriving her&s;elf of what &s;he owned would be one great alleviation of the re&s;traint and mi&s;ery under which &s;he was condemned to repine. The moments of reflection, therefore, on the un|ea&s;y hours of this beloved parent, were the only moments that pa&s;&s;ed without plea&s;ure, amounting &s;ometimes to rapture, when, as &s;he approached
<PB N="256" REF="029524_0258_0FE1D6257A31D3C0">
the Alps, the mo&s;t &s;ublime and magnificent views of nature were opened to her a&s;toni&s;hed view.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed of late to the flat, monotonous, and unintere&s;ting views round London, &s;he had frequently &s;ighed for the more animating land|&s;capes of her native country; and had no ideas of beauty &s;uperior to that which is formed by tho&s;e green and undulating hills, in &s;ome places fringed half-way up by beech woods, in others rearing their turfy mounds, covered with &s;heep on one &s;ide above the once impenetrable fore&s;ts of the weald, on the other gradually declining towards the apparently boundle&s;s ocean that forms the Engli&s;h channel.</P>
<P>But when &s;he &s;aw the rich and luxuriant coun|try, which nature, "with all her great works about her," &s;preads before the a&s;toni&s;hed travel|ler, between Lyons and Civita Vecchia, the port from whence Montalbert determined to embark for Sicily, in order to avoid both Rome and Na|ples, her mind was exalted by &s;cenes &s;o much &s;uperior to any &s;he had ever formed an idea of either from the efforts of the pen or the pencil. She &s;eemed tran&s;ported to a world of higher rank in the univer&s;e than that &s;he had inhabited while &s;he was in England; and &s;he was of an age and di&s;po&s;ition to forget, or at lea&s;t be indifferent to tho&s;e circum&s;tances which can hardly fail to re|mind Engli&s;h travellers, that, though other countries may have more bold and attractive &s;cenery, their own is that where life is enjoyed with the greate&s;t comfort.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="029524_0259_0FE1D64CF500E0D0">Arrived at Civita Vecchia, after an ab&s;ence of ten weeks, from England, Montalbert felt &s;ome degree of unea&s;ine&s;s when he knew he mu&s;t hear from his friend, the Count d'Alozzi, what had pa&s;&s;ed during his ab&s;ence. From this he was re|lieved by finding a &s;ervant of the Count's waiting for him with a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el hired to convey him and Ro&s;alie to Me&s;&s;ina, where the Count waited his arrival, that, after Ro&s;alie was fixed at the habitation he had prepared for her, they might return together to Naples.</P>
<P>Montalbert, who now &s;aw him&s;elf freed from the painful &s;olicitudes that had &s;o long perplexed him, would not, however, li&s;ten to Ro&s;alie's en|treaties to embark immediately.

<P>Montalbert, however, who knew that this was not a place where it was likely he &s;hould be known, remained with great tranquillity for three days. All &s;eemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> favour their voyage, which he con&s;idered, not without &s;ome pain, mu&s;t be twice as long as if he had &s;ailed from the Bay of Naples. The weather, however, was mild, and the wind favourable; and a voyage begun thus propitiou&s;ly was as happily concluded, though not till they had been eight days at &s;ea. On the

evening of the la&s;t, by as bright a moon as ever enlightened the &s;welling waves of the Mediterra|nean, they entered the port of Me&s;&s;ina. Never did the magnificent &s;pectacle it afforded give more delight than Ro&s;alie felt, as, &s;itting upon deck, Montalbert pointed out to her the beauty of the &s;cene. The inconveniences and tediou&s;|ne&s;s of the voyage were no longer remembered. As the ve&s;&s;el &s;lowly approached the &s;hore, every object, in the beautiful bay, was di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible. The bright light of the moon fell on the long line of magnificent buildings that overlook the Faro of Me&s;&s;ina, above which ro&s;e the mountains, who&s;e outline was boldly marked in the deep blue aether, while Etna, no otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h|ed than by its towering grandeur, ro&s;e &s;ublimely above the re&s;t.

<P>WHILE Montalbert felt him&s;elf highly grati|fied and obliged by the car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his friend had taken to provide every thing in their new abode that could render it convenient and agreeable to Ro&s;a|lie, &s;he was never weary with contemplating the beauty of the &s;cenery around her. A garden, which even the fal&s;e Italian ta&s;te could not &s;poil, aro&s;e behind the hou&s;e, and its orange trees fring|ed the foot of a hill, which would in England have been called a mountain. Even the verdure

of England was in &s;ome mea&s;ure enjoyed here amid the glowing &s;uns of Italy; for the higher lands are refre&s;hed by dews, which prevent their being parched like the plains. Beyond the en|clo&s;ure, &s;hrubs, which are carefully cultivated in England, grew &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and formed a na|tural wilderne&s;s of the gaye&s;t colours and lighte&s;t foliage. From hence the mo&s;t glorious view pre&s;ented it&s;elf that imagination could picture: the &s;ea, and the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Calabria; the Lipari i&s;lands; Strombolo, marked by a black wreath of curling &s;moke &s;taining the mild and clear &s;ky; innumerable ve&s;&s;els &s;cattered about the blue expan&s;e of water; and the faro of Me&s;|&s;ina giving to the whole a new and &s;ingular fea|ture, connecting the varieties of an exten&s;ive &s;ea view with a port, &s;eemed almo&s;t to unite the i&s;land to the oppo&s;ite continent.</P>
<P>Dive&s;ted of every care that related to the pa&s;t, &s;ave only her &s;olicitude for Mrs. Vyvian, Ro&s;alie would have fancied her&s;elf in Paradi&s;e, had not Montalbert been reminded by the Count of the nece&s;&s;ity of their immediately departing together for Naples.</P>
<P>This zealous friend had forborne to vi&s;it them till &s;ome days after their being &s;ettled in their new habitation. He appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o feel for Ro&s;alie all that re&s;pectful admiration which beauty and &s;weetne&s;s, like hers, naturally in&s;pired. Her manner of &s;peaking Italian was particularly in|tere&s;ting to the Count, who &s;eemed to be delight|ed to in&s;truct her. He lamented to her the cru|el but nece&s;&s;ary repre&s;entations that he thought
<PB N="261" REF="029524_0263_0FE1D65392C2A878">
him&s;elf obliged to make to Montalbert, that he mu&s;t either determine to go back to Naples, or give up the plan of concealment which had alrea|dy co&s;t him &s;o much trouble. Ro&s;alie in her in|genuous and intere&s;ting manner, confe&s;&s;ed their obligations to him, but &s;ighed, and with difficulty re&s;trained from tears; while acknowledging the truth of his ob&s;ervations, &s;he trembled at the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of yielding to them.</P>
<P>Montalbert, with whom rea&s;on and love were at variance with each other, became every day more gloomy, pen&s;ive, and unea&s;y. Sometimes he determined to hazard every thing rather than leave her. "After all," &s;aid he, as he entered into the&s;e arguments with him&s;elf&mdash;"after all, what is it that I am contending for?&mdash;for what is it that I am &s;acrificing tho&s;e hours that will re|turn no more?&mdash;for money which I may never enjoy&mdash;for high pro&s;perity which is not, that I know of, conducive to real happine&s;s. Is it not true, that a day, an hour, at this &s;ea&s;on of my life, is worth half an age towards its clo&s;e?&mdash;Yet I am throwing away the&s;e precious hours of youth and health, in hopes of being a very rich man hereafter."</P>
<P>However, the&s;e arguments, whatever might be their &s;olidity, if tried by the maxims of Epi|curean Philo&s;ophy, &s;ometimes yielded to other con&s;iderations.&mdash;He was not devoid of ambition; nor could he wholly dive&s;t him&s;elf of that &s;ort of attachment towards his mother, which, though it had more of fear than of love it it, had become a &s;ort of principle from habit.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="029524_0264_0FE1D630A64122F8">His frequent fits of &s;ilence, his melancholy look, and long &s;olitary walks by the &s;ea &s;ide, the evident irre&s;olution and deep depre&s;&s;ion he labour|ed under, gave to Ro&s;alie the mo&s;t poignant un|ea&s;ine&s;s. She &s;ometimes was afraid of increa&s;ing the&s;e &s;ymptoms of a mind, ill at ea&s;e, by appear|ing to notice them. At other times &s;he ventured gently to remon&s;trate with him. At length, after a conference of &s;ome hours with Alozzi, he &s;ud|denly took a re&s;olution to depart the next day. Alozzi was returning to Naples, and they were to embark together.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution he &s;eemed to have adopted in con&s;equence of having reflected, that, if he did not &s;oon go, he might not return time enough for the hour &s;o dreaded, yet &s;o de&s;ired, when Ro&s;alie might give birth to another being only le&s;s dear to him than her&s;elf. This was to be expected now within two months. To be ab&s;ent at &s;uch a time was infinitely more formidable to his imagination than leaving her now; and, as if this had never occurred to him before, he now re&s;olutely determined to tear him&s;elf away.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie &s;aw him depart with angui&s;h of heart, which &s;he endeavoured to &s;tifle, that what he felt might not be increa&s;ed. But when Alozzi had carried him off, almo&s;t by force, &s;o dreadful did it &s;eem to him to &s;ay adieu!&mdash;&s;he was &s;o much affected, that &s;he could not remain at the window till they were out of &s;ight; but, &s;hutting her|&s;elf in her own appartment, &s;he gave her&s;elf up to tears.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="029524_0265_0FE1D655CD920790">The remon&s;trances, however, of her Italian woman, who was already much attached to her, and the care which, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, &s;he owed to her own health, even for his &s;ake, who&s;e ab&s;ence &s;he lamented, rou&s;ed her at length from this indulgence of u&s;ele&s;s regret. She now &s;ought to amu&s;e her mind by contemplating anew the &s;cenes around her; but their charms were in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t. Montalbert was no longer with her to point out the beauties that every where &s;urrounded their abode, or to enjoy them with her. There was an aweful &s;ublimity in the great outline of Etna, its deep fore&s;ts, and mag|nificent features, which afforded a kind of me|lancholy plea&s;ure. Not in &s;ituation to explore the &s;cenes it offered more minutely, yet feeling infinite curio&s;ity, &s;he endeavoured to amu&s;e her mind with the pro&s;pect of future days. Montal|bert would return to her; &s;he &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed in beholding his tenderne&s;s for his child; &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould again li&s;ten to his animated de&s;cription of a country replete with wonders, or be able, per|haps, to vi&s;it it with him. In the mean time &s;he determined to pa&s;s the heavy, heavy hours in cultivating the talents he loved. She took up her pencils, and, &s;trolling into the garden, placed her&s;elf on the &s;eat where, as they often fat toge|ther, he had pointed out to her &s;ome points of view which were particularly favourable to the painter. She would have &s;ketched them, but her efforts were faint and uncertain. In &s;pite of all her exertions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ark pre&s;entiments of future evil hung upon her &s;pirits. Their depre&s;&s;ion &s;he im|puted
<PB N="264" REF="029524_0266_0FE1D63270077C88">
to her per&s;onal &s;ufferings. The period, to which it was &s;o natural for her to look forward with dread, was now near. She had heard, indeed, that in the climate of Sicily infinitely le&s;s was to be apprehended than in England. But this &s;he only knew from the report of per&s;ons who might &s;ay it to appea&s;e her &s;ears and rea&s;&s;ure her &s;pirits. Perhaps it was her de&s;tiny to be &s;natched from Montalbert, to relea&s;e him from his embar|ra&s;&s;ment, and to make room for the Roman lady, to whom his mother was &s;o de&s;irous of uniting him.&mdash;While the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed through her mind, in gloomy &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;he repeated, from the little, &s;imple ballad of Gay&mdash;
<Q><L>"Thou'lt meet a happier maiden,</L>
<L>"But none that loves thee &s;o!"</L></Q>
At length, however &s;lowly, the tedious hours wore away. Montalbert returned. He return|ed apparently more enamoured than before this ab&s;ence of nine weeks, and Ro&s;alie forgot that &s;he had ever been unhappy.</P>
<P>When, the fir&s;t joy of their meeting being a little &s;ubdued, Ro&s;alie &s;poke to her hu&s;band of his mother, &s;he fancied that though he declined conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject, he was in reality le&s;s anxious about the future con&s;equences of his mar|riage than &s;he had ever yet &s;een him. When he could not wholly evade &s;peaking on the &s;ubject, he affected an indifference, which made Ro&s;alie believe he was him&s;elf at ea&s;e; for, little &s;killed her&s;elf in di&s;&s;imulation, &s;he did not for a moment imagine that this tranquillity was artificial.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="029524_0267_0FE1D657690D52B8">At length the hour arrived when real joy &s;uc|ceeded to this external calm. Ro&s;alie brought into the world a lovely boy: and her own health was &s;o &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, that, in a very few weeks, her beauty appeared more brilliant than before her confinement. More attached to her than ever, Montalbert could hardly bear to have her a moment out of his &s;ight; yet the time was come, when, if he followed the dictates of that prudence to which he had already made &s;o many &s;acrifices, he mu&s;t return to Naples.</P>
<P>Alozzi, who&s;e friend&s;hip for him appeared to be undimini&s;hed, failed not to remind Montalbert of the nece&s;&s;ity of this return. But his remon|&s;trances, however rea&s;onable and gentle, were always received with unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ometimes with impatience and ill-humour. The vi&s;its of Alozzi had not been more frequent than formerly; on the contrary, he had been more rarely their vi&s;itor than during his former &s;tay at Me&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> though he returned thither before Montalbert, he never appeared at the re&s;idence of Ro&s;alie till his friend arrived there. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, however, the fault of Montalbert's temper found food to nouri&s;h it&s;elf in the looks of Alozzi, who he fancied, regarded Ro&s;alie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> too much admiration, and &s;ometimes fixed on her eyes in which pa&s;&s;ion and hope were too evi|dently expre&s;&s;ed. This idea having once &s;eized the imagination of Montalbert, became a &s;ource of inexpre&s;&s;ible torment: and when he reflected, that he mu&s;t &s;oon leave his wife in the hou&s;e of this friend, who was, he per&s;uaded him&s;elf, in
<PB N="266" REF="029524_0268_0FE1D6341059E5D8">
love with her, neither her virtues, nor her at|tachment to him, neither the honour of his friend nor the confidence he ought to have had in Ro&s;a|lie, were &s;ufficient to quiet his apprehen&s;ions, though he felt them to be alike injurious to his own peace, and to that of tho&s;e whom he mo&s;t loved.</P>
<P>Sometimes he gazed on Ro&s;alie as &s;he &s;at with his boy &s;leeping in her arms, and tried to per|&s;uade him&s;elf, that if once his mother could &s;ee the&s;e intere&s;ting creatures, &s;he would not only pardon him, but receive them to her protection and tenderne&s;s. Then, recollecting what had pa&s;&s;ed during his la&s;t vi&s;it to this violent and impracticable parent, he felt that all &s;uch hopes were delu&s;ive. He became a&s;hamed of what often appeared to him an unpardonable meanne&s;s, and re&s;olved, at whatever pecuniary ri&s;k, to throw off a yoke which degraded him in his own eyes; to produce his wife and his child and abide the con&s;equences of his mother's di&s;plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>While Montalbert was thus deliberating, and every hour forming and abandoning projects for the future, a letter he received from Naples, compelled him to adopt the mea&s;ure of immedi|ately going thither. It was from a female rela|tion, who u&s;ually re&s;ided with his mother; and who now informed him, that &s;he was extremely ill, and it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;ee her as immediately as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Wretched is the policy which too often puts at variance the be&s;t feelings of human nature; which &s;ets the parent again&s;t the child, becau&s;e
<PB N="267" REF="029524_0269_0FE1D6590BA87F40">
expences either affect his ea&s;e, or are painful to his avarice; which e&s;trange the brother from the &s;i&s;ter, and make enemies of the amiable and love|ly group, who, but a few, a very few years be|fore, were happy a&s;&s;ociates in the innocent&punc; thoughtle&s;s hours of childhood.&mdash;Ah! wretched is the policy which makes the &s;on too often rejoice when &s;he who bore him and nouri&s;hed him min|gles with the du&s;t; when tho&s;e eyes are clo&s;ed which have &s;o often been filled with tears of ten|der anxiety as they gazed on him!&mdash;and yet all the contrivances, which cunning and caution have invented for the &s;ecurity of property, have a direct tendency to occa&s;ion all this, while mi&s;taken views of happine&s;s, unfortunate mi&s;takes in the head, or deficiency of feeling in the heart, do the re&s;t, and occa&s;ion more than half the mi&s;eries of life.</P>
<P>Montalbert, on receiving the letter that gave him notice of his mother's danger, felt, for a mo|ment, that he was her &s;on; but almo&s;t as &s;oon this &s;en&s;e of filial duty and affection was lo&s;t in an involuntary recollection of the relea&s;e which her death would give him from the pain of con|cealing a clande&s;tine marriage, or reducing him|&s;elf and his po&s;terity to indigence if he betrayed it.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner felt this &s;entiment ari&s;e in his mind than he was &s;hocked at and re&s;i&s;ted it; but again it aro&s;e: and he found all his affection for his mother weak, when oppo&s;ed to the idea of the advantages he might derive from her quit|ting the world where &s;he alone was the barrier
<PB N="268" REF="029524_0270_0FE1D6364522F100">
between him and happine&s;s with the woman he adored.</P>
<P>It was not, however, a time to inve&s;tigate the&s;e &s;entiments deeply, but to act in pur&s;uance of the letter. He ha&s;tened, therefore, to inform his wife of its contents, who agreed with him entire|ly as to the urgency of his immediate departure, yet wept and hung about him as if impre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome unu&s;ual apprehen&s;ion of future &s;orrow; and, as &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her child, &s;he almo&s;t drowned it with her tears.</P>
<P>Montalbert, who felt none of this violent grief at an ab&s;ence, the duration of which would, as he thought, depend on him&s;elf, con&s;oled her with views of future pro&s;perity and uninterrupted hap|pine&s;s. Alozzi had a few days before left Me&s;&s;i|na, and was gone to Agrigentum, where he intended to remain &s;ome time. Montalbert, therefore, who had no doubt but that he &s;hould return within five or &s;ix weeks, felt no unea&s;ine&s;s at the thoughts of leaving to frequent interviews with his wife, in his ab&s;ence, a man whom all his rea&s;on did not enable him to &s;ee with her, in his pre&s;ence, without pain.</P>
<P>The letter Montalbert had received was written in &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing terms, that there was no time to be lo&s;t; and he determined to begin his journey on the next day.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie, far from feeling the u&s;ual tranquility, &s;aw the moment of his bidding her adieu arrive with agonies of &s;orrow, which &s;he knew not how to account for&mdash;yet could not &s;tifle or command. Nothing new had occurred in her &s;ituation to
<PB N="269" REF="029524_0271_0FE1D6614B162E38">
make this ab&s;ence more dreadful than the two preceding ones. Indeed it &s;hould have been otherwi&s;e, for the pre&s;ence of her infant, on which &s;he doated with all the fondne&s;s of a fir&s;t maternal affection, was what was mo&s;t likely to con&s;ole her in this temporary parting from its father: nor had &s;he to &s;ay, with the unhappy Dido&mdash;
<Q><L>"Si quis mihi parvulus aula</L>
<L>"Luderet Aeneas, qui te tantum ore referret;</L>
<L>"Non equidem omnino capta aut de&s;erta viderer."</L>
<BIBL>VIRGIL'S AENEID.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The &s;ervants about her were the &s;ame as tho&s;e with whom &s;he had formerly rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied. The &s;ituation around her offered all that the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lively &s;cenes of nature could do to a&s;&s;uage the pain inflicted by her hu&s;band's involuntary and &s;hort ab&s;ence. All this &s;he urged to appea&s;e the tumult of her &s;pirits. She owned the ju&s;tice of it all: but nothing gave her any con&s;olation; and, when &s;he at la&s;t allowed him to tear him&s;elf away, the re&s;olution to &s;ee him depart was ac|quired by an effort &s;o painful, that he was hardly out of &s;ight before her &s;en&s;es for&s;ook her; and it was many hours before the remo&s;trances of Zuli|etta, her Italian maid, and of an older woman who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the care of her infant boy, &s;o far rou&s;ed her from the de&s;pondence into which &s;he fell, as to engage her to attend to the care of her own health, on which depended that of the child &s;he nouri&s;hed at her brea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="029524_0272_0FE1D63B84CAD268">By degrees, however, &s;he became more com|po&s;ed. She received a cheerful letter from Mon|talbert, &s;ent by a ve&s;&s;el which pa&s;&s;ed them at &s;ea. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntioned, that they were becalmed, but that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as perfectly well, and had no doubt of writ|ing to her the next day from Naples. A&s;hamed of fears and of de&s;pondence, which &s;eemed, as &s;oon as &s;he could rea&s;on upon them, to have &s;o little foundation, &s;he returned once more to the amu&s;ements which u&s;ed to beguile the hours of her hu&s;band's ab&s;ence: and all that were not de|dicated to the care of her child, whom &s;he at|tended to her&s;elf, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed in cultivating tho&s;e talents which Montalbert loved, and in which he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted and marked her progre&s;s with &s;uch exqui&s;ite delight.</P>
