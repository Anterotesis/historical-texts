<P>FOR the Wages of Sin is Death: but the Gift of God is eternal Life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle having, in this chapter, repre|&s;ented the obligations Chri&s;tians are under to avoid &s;in and lead a virtuous life; he, in the clo&s;e of it, declares the different ends of the righte|ous and wicked: how happy one will be, and how mi&s;erable the other. See the two ver&s;es immediately preceeding our text, <HI>What fruit had ye then in tho&s;e things, whereof ye are now a&s;hamed? for the end of tho&s;e things is death. But now being made free from &s;in, and become &s;ervants to God, ye have your fruits unto holine&s;s, and the end everla&s;ting life.</HI> And here our text follows&mdash; <HI>For the wages of &s;in is death; but the gift of God is eter|nal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable here, that the puni&s;hment of the wicked is called wages, to &s;hew that it is the ju&s;t de|merit of their crimes; and that the reward of the righteous, is called the gift of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to &s;hew that it is not merited by their good works, but is a free gift procured for them by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great Mediator between God and man.&mdash; It is ob&s;ervable al&s;o, that the puni&s;hment of the wicked is called Death, and the reward of the righteous Life, to &s;hew the greatne&s;s both of the one and of the other:
<PB N="6" REF="012375_0004_0F893F1F638CA988">
It being u&s;ual in &s;cripture to expre&s;s the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s by life, and the greate&s;t mi&s;ery by death; life being the greate&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings, as it is the foundation of all others, and death the greate&s;t of evils to tho&s;e who have their portion in this world, not only as it is painful and terrible in it&s;elf, but al&s;o as it deprives them of all their enjoyments, and fixeth them in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery, which is the natural con&s;equence as well as puni&s;hment of their &s;ins.</P>
<P>Our text, as it &s;tands connected with the preceed|ing context, will lead to the con&s;ideration of the fol|lowing things.</P>
<P>That the end of a wicked life, will be everla&s;ting mi&s;ery. And</P>
<P>That this is the due wages, or ju&s;t demerit of the &s;inners crimes.</P>
<P>That the end of a religious life, will be eternal happine&s;s. And</P>
<P>That this is, in no mea&s;ure, merited by the good works of the righteous, but is the free gift of God. And</P>
<P>That this un&s;peakable gift, is procured for them&punc; by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered is,</P>
<P>That the end of a wicked life will be everla&s;ting mi&s;ery; that is, to tho&s;e who continue in their wick|edne&s;s, and die without repentance. Some repent, and apply to Chri&s;t, and through him, obtain for|givene&s;s. Yea God is &s;ome times plea&s;ed, to give re|pentance to tho&s;e, who have lived in a long cour&s;e of &s;in; and have been guilty of very heinous tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons; even &s;uch as the wi&s;dom of human govern|ments, has thought fit to puni&s;h with death. I &s;ay God is &s;ometimes plea&s;ed, in great mercy to &s;uch, to give them grace to repent and receive an offered Sa|viour, and then they are plucked as brands out of the burning, and made happy forever. But when &s;inners
<PB N="7" REF="012375_0005_0F893F2025D52670">
refu&s;e to be reclaimed, and continue in their &s;ins till they leave the world; there is then nothing for them but <HI>a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indigna|tion to devour them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x.27.</NOTE> They then <HI>go away into everla&s;t|ing puni&s;hment,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxv.46.</NOTE> and <HI>&s;uffer the vengeance of eternal fire.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jude 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>By death, in our text, may be implied temporal as well as eternal death: For that is al&s;o the wages of &s;in; as appears not only from that threatening of God to Adam&mdash;<HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die,</HI> but al&s;o from what is &s;aid in Rom. v.12. <HI>As by one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in; and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned.</HI></P>
<P>And an untimely, violent, and ignominious death is the wages of tho&s;e atrocious crimes, which render the committers of them dangerous to others, and pe&s;ts to &s;ociety: Or when the public good requires their being made examples of, for a terror to others. This is the puni&s;hment which they receive from men. But this, how &s;evere and terrible &s;oever it may &s;eem, is no|thing to that, which if they die impenitent, they will re|ceive, more immediately from the hand of God. For, what is mainly intended by death, in our text, is eternal mi&s;ery; as appears by its being put in oppo&s;ition to eternal life: And from the &s;ame oppo&s;ition in Mat. xxv.46. where it is al&s;o expre&s;ly &s;aid to be everla&s;ting, <HI>the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment: but the righteous into life eternal.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame greek word is here u&s;ed to expre&s;s the duration both of the happine&s;s of the righteous and mi&s;ery of the wicked.</NOTE> And it is not only a&s;&s;erted here, but in many other places of &s;cripture, where it is called <HI>everla&s;ting de&s;truction</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">2 The&s;. i.9.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>eternal damnation</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Mark iii.29.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>and everla&s;ting &s;hame and contempt.</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Dan. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ii.2.</NOTE> And &s;inners are &s;aid to be puni&s;hed, in <HI>everla&s;ting burnings</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xxxiii.14.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>in fire that is never quenched</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark ix.43, 44&punc; 45, 46, 48.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>in blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s forever</HI><NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">Jude 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>and the &s;moke of their torment is</HI> &s;aid to <HI>a&s;cend forever and ever.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiv.11.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012375_0006_0F893F20E3185830">It appears from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, that the puni&s;hment of the wicked, in another world will not only be everla&s;ting, but exceeding great in degree: Since it is repre&s;ented by that which is capable of putting us to the greate&s;t mi&s;ery in this world; namely, burning in the hotte&s;t fire. And as their torment will be exqui&s;ite, &s;o it &s;eems it will be without inter|mi&s;&s;ion or mitigation: They will not be allowed &s;o much as a <HI>drop of water to cool their tongues.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi.23, 24, 25.</NOTE> And into this dreadful &s;tate of exqui&s;ite and everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, &s;inners pa&s;s as &s;oon as they leave the world. They go, with Judas, to their own place <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts i.25.</NOTE> and in hell they lift up their eyes being in torment.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding this puni&s;hment is thus great and everla&s;ting; yet</P>
<P>It is but the due wages and ju&s;t demerit of the &s;in|ner's crimes. It is what God has ordered, and therefore mu&s;t be ju&s;t and right: And what the &s;inner will not have the lea&s;t rea&s;on to complain of.&mdash;Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? If any &s;hould enquire, how it can con&s;i&s;t with the ju&s;tice of God, to puni&s;h temporary crimes with eternal mi&s;ery let them con&s;ider,</P>
<P>That the dignity of the per&s;on again&s;t whom a crime is committed, greatly inhances the crime. The &s;ame crime, as to the matter of it, is much greater when committed again&s;t a king, than when committed again&s;t one of our fellow &s;ubjects: And doubtle&s;s the &s;ame crime committed again&s;t God, ri&s;eth in propor|tion to his &s;uperiority and dignity above a temporal king: And in the &s;ame proportion, the puni&s;hment of it may be ju&s;tly increa&s;ed. 1 Sam. ii.25. If one man &s;in again&s;t another, the Judge &s;hall judge him; but if a man &s;in again&s;t the Lord, who &s;hall intreat for him? Again, let them con&s;ider,</P>
<P>That God &s;ets before men, life and death, rewards and puni&s;hments, and deals with them according to
<PB N="9" REF="012375_0007_0F893F21A3701908">
their own free choice: And that this is agreeable to ju&s;tice, cannot be denied. We have the offer of eter|nal happine&s;s, for a &s;hort life of obedience, as well as the threatening of eternal mi&s;ery, for a &s;hort life of &s;in: And it is not only left to us which we will chu&s;e, but various powerful means are u&s;ed with us to induce us to avoid death and mi&s;ery, and to chu&s;e life and happine&s;s; and if after all we chu&s;e death, and wilfully expo&s;e our&s;elves to the threatened puni&s;hment; is it not ju&s;t in God to let us have our choice, and leave us to &s;uffer the &s;ad effects of our folly? To u&s;e the words of another&mdash;
<Q>Since the rewards and puni&s;h|ments are both eternal, the terms on both &s;ides are equal; and &s;ince it is in our power, by the help of divine grace, to avoid the puni&s;hment, and to ob|tain the reward, the condition is &s;uch, as any wi&s;e man would be thankful for; far from complaining, that the terrors of puni&s;hment are joined to the en|couragements of reward; that all motives concur to make him happy; and that God, in his great mer|cy, has u&s;ed all means, both inward by his grace, and outward by his threats and promi&s;es, to bring him to &s;alvation.</Q>
Once more, let them con&s;ider,</P>
<P>That it &s;eems to have been nece&s;&s;ary, that eternal puni&s;hment &s;hould be threatened again&s;t the violaters of the divine laws, &s;ince a le&s;s puni&s;hment would not have been &s;ufficient to &s;ecure man's obedience to them. We &s;ee, now eternal mi&s;ery is threatened, it is not &s;ufficient, with the greate&s;t part of mankind, to deter them from &s;in; and if a le&s;s puni&s;hment had been threatened, it would have had a proportionably le&s;s influence. And God's end in threatening is not that he may puni&s;h, but that he might prevent men's wick|edne&s;s, which hath a nece&s;&s;ary connection with mi&s;ery; and to excite them to a religious life, the end whereof is happine&s;s. Since then God's goodne&s;s was the foundation of his threatenings, it was certainly ju&s;t for
<PB N="10" REF="012375_0008_0F893F2263DB7568">
him to threaten as he hath done; and if it was ju&s;t for him to threaten, then it is ju&s;t for him to execute his threatenings; and that he will execute them, ap|pears from his truth and veracity; Num. xxiii.19. <HI>God is not a man, that he &s;hould lie, nor the Son of man, that he &s;hould repent; hath he &s;aid, and &s;hall he not do it? or hath he &s;poken, and &s;hall he not make it good?</HI> Thus it appears that the wicked will be puni&s;hed, in the world to come, with everla&s;ting mi&s;ery; and that this is the due wages, and ju&s;t demerit, of their crimes.&mdash; I now proceed to the next thing propo&s;ed, which was to &s;hew,</P>
<P>That the end of a life of piety and virtue, in this world, will be eternal happine&s;s, in the world to come. This al&s;o, God, who is truth it&s;elf, hath declared and promi&s;ed. See the ver&s;e immediately preceeding our text,&mdash;<HI>But now being made free from &s;in, and become &s;er|vants to God, ye have your fruit unto holine&s;s, and the end everla&s;ting life.</HI> And Mat. xxvth chap. and la&s;t ver&s;e, <HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment; but the righteous unto life eternal.</HI> By life eternal, is not only intended, a &s;tate of eternal exi&s;tence, for &s;o the wicked will live forever; but by it is intended, a &s;tate of ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s. When the righteous leave this world, they leave all &s;orrow and trouble with it, and enter into an unchangeable &s;tate of ea&s;e, comfort and happine&s;s. They go into <HI>God's pre&s;ence,</HI> where there <HI>is fullne&s;s of joy,</HI> and are placed <HI>at his right hand,</HI> where there <HI>are plea&s;ures forever more.</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">P&s;al. x<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">vi.11.</NOTE> Their happine&s;s is not only eternal, but compleat and perfect. All their de&s;ires are &s;atisfied; yea, they have more than heart can wi&s;h. <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard,</HI> nor is the heart of man, (while in this world) capable of con|ceiving <HI>the good things, which God hath laid up for them that love him.</HI></P>
<P>The next thing propo&s;ed was to &s;hew, that this glorious and eternal &s;tate of happine&s;s, is in no mea|&s;ure
<PB N="11" REF="012375_0009_0F893F2323000D70">
merited by the good works of the righteous, but is the free gift of God. The Phari&s;ees among the Jews, thought they could do God much &s;ervice, and merit a reward of him, by their good works. And the Papi&s;ts among Chri&s;tians, hold the &s;ame doctrine now. But this is a vain notion, and without the lea&s;t foundation, either in rea&s;on or &s;cripture; but what is plainly condemned by both. Rea&s;on tells us, that as we are God's creatures, and depend entirely on him for life, breath, and all things, all the &s;ervice we can po&s;&s;ibly render him, is mo&s;t ju&s;tly due to him. And therefore that when we have done our utmo&s;t, we can|not demand a reward of him, for what we have done, any more, than we can demand a reward of our neighbour for paying him a debt, which we ju&s;tly owed him. The &s;criptures al&s;o plainly teach us the &s;ame; Luke xvii.7&mdash;10. <HI>Which of you, having a &s;ervant plowing or feeding cattle, will &s;ay to him by and by, when he cometh from the field, go and &s;it down to meat? And will not rather &s;ay unto him, make ready wherewith I may &s;up&punc; and gird thy&s;elf and &s;erve me, 'till I have eaten and drank, and afterward thou &s;halt eat and drink. Doth he thank that &s;ervant becau&s;e he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewi&s;e ye, when ye &s;hall have done all the&s;e things that are commanded you; &s;ay, we are unprofitable &s;ervants; we have done that which was our duty to do.</HI> As we are God's &s;ervants, all our time, &s;trength, and abilities&mdash;all we have and are, are his; and therefore we &s;hould be con&s;tantly employed in his &s;ervice. And when we are &s;o, we do but our duty, and mu&s;t &s;ay, we are unprofitable &s;ervants. This we ought to &s;ay, if we did all that is commanded us, which we know we never do; and therefore we are not only unprofitable, but &s;inful, di&s;|obedient &s;ervants. There is none that doeth good, and &s;inneth not. And therefore in&s;tead of meriting any thing at God's hands, we &s;tand in continual need of his pardoning mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012375_0010_0F893F23E24529B0">All the good things therefore which we receive at God's hands (or in other words, all we enjoy, for we receive all from him) are the effects of his free grace and bounty. Not unto us therefore, not unto us&mdash; but to his name the prai&s;e is due.</P>
<P>The la&s;t thing propo&s;ed, was to &s;hew,</P>
<P>That this un&s;peakable gift of eternal life, was pro|cured for us by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. We are all &s;inners; and &s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law; the penalty whereof is death. The &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die; that is, be mi&s;erable forever.</P>
<P>By Sin we had ruined and de&s;troyed our&s;elves, but in God and Chri&s;t was our help found. <HI>God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who|&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;t|ing life.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii.16.</NOTE> Chri&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed Son of God, came into the world, and &s;uffered and died, to <HI>make reconciliation for iniquity,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dan. ix.24.</NOTE> <HI>and bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> He &s;uffered&mdash;<HI>the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii.18.</NOTE> <HI>Chri&s;t is the way, the truth and the life,</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John xiv.6.</NOTE> and <HI>there is no other name under heaven, whereby we can be &s;aved.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts iv.12.</NOTE> God hath given us <HI>the promi&s;e of eternal life</HI> <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">1 John, ii.15.</NOTE> but <HI>this life is in the Son.

<P>Let us now make &s;ome improvement of what has been thus briefly &s;aid on this &s;ubject, And</P>
<P N="1">1. Will the end of a &s;inful life, be eternal death and mi&s;ery? How exceeding fooli&s;h then are they who lead &s;uch a life! And alas! how many &s;uch are there! What multitudes <HI>live, as without God in the world, and as if they were made to &s;erve divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures?</HI>&mdash; are under no re&s;traint&punc; but <HI>commit all manner of &s;in with greedine&s;s</HI> How &s;trange is it that rational crea|tures,
<PB N="13" REF="012375_0011_0F893F2588968450">
&s;hould act &s;o mad and fooli&s;h a part!

And oh! be per&s;uaded immediately to <HI>break off from your &s;ins by repentance, and from your iniquities, by turning unto God. Turn ye&mdash;turn ye, for why will ye die</HI> and be mi&s;erable forever.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is eternal mi&s;ery the due wages, and ju&s;t demerit of &s;in? This &s;hews the evil nature and great maligni|ty of it. For how vile a thing mu&s;t that be, which de&s;erves &s;o great a puni&s;hment? God who knows the true nature of things, is repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as having the greate&s;t hatred to &s;in: It is &s;tiled <HI>the abo|minable thing which his &s;oul hates.</HI> Shall not we then dete&s;t and abhor it, and u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours to avoid it? When we are tempted to &s;in, let us tremble at the thought; and &s;ay, with Jo&s;eph, <HI>how &s;hall we do this great wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Is this puni&s;hment but the due wages, and ju&s;t de&s;ert of &s;in? We hence &s;ee, who the wretched Inha|bitants of hell mu&s;t blame, that they are thus mi&s;erable. They will be without excu&s;e: Their own con&s;ciences will condemn them; and they will have none to blame but them&s;elves, that this awful puni&s;hment is inflicted on them. They will &s;ee that their condemnation is perfectly ju&s;t; and that it is entirely their own fault that they peri&s;h. And Oh! What an aggravation will it be of their mi&s;ery, to act on their folly and madne&s;s, in thus ruining and de&s;troying them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="14" REF="012375_0012_0F893F262C914188">4. Is eternal life the gift of God, how great then is his goodne&s;s?

<P>THE unhappy man, previous to who&s;e execution the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e was delivered, was born in Ireland&punc; and educated in the principles of the Church of Rome. In his 20th year he came over to America, lived about a year at Bo&s;ton, and then went to Ca&s;co-Bay, where he married, and had a number of children. His wife and all his children, except one, died &s;ome time before his tragical end. In the time of the la&s;t war, he was &s;ix years and an half in the army, and was finally at the taking of the Havannah. His bu&s;ine&s;s before and after this was that of a mariner. He was employed &s;ometimes in the fi&s;hery, &s;ometimes in the coa&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ometimes in foreign voyages. Though he appeared to be tolerably well acquainted with reading and writing, yet he was very ignorant in things of Religion, having almo&s;t entirely neglected the means of religious knowledge. For a number of years, he attended no publick wor&s;hip, &s;eldom looked into the bible, or any other book on religious &s;ubjects. And when he did read, he confined his reading, as he told me, to hi&s;tory and books of di|ver&s;ion. In con&s;equence of this, he was a mo&s;t abandon'd &s;inner; living as without God in the world, and as if he had been made to &s;erve divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures. He was horribly profane; was addicted to intemperate drinking, whoring, lying, fighting and quarrelling, and almo&s;t all manner of wickedne&s;s; and finally was charged with, and convicted of the heinous crime which brought him to the gallows.</P>
<P>It appeared on his trial that he went up, in the middle of the night, to the room where Mrs. <HI>Hollowell</HI> lay, found her a&s;leep, awaken her, and &s;wore, if &s;he made the lea&s;t noi&s;e, he would kill her; and then &s;topping her mouth, perpe|trated the atrocious crime. After which (to prevent, it &s;eems, a pregnancy) he abu&s;ed her with his hand, in an unheard-of, cruel and &s;hocking man|ner: In&s;omuch that her life was for &s;ome time almo&s;t de&s;paired of; and &s;he was not able for ten days after to get off her bed without help. It was ob&s;erved by the honourable court, that they never had a cau&s;e of this kind before them, wherein the evidence again&s;t the criminal was more full and clear. Yet he de|nied both the Rape and the abu&s;e after it; and in&s;i&s;ted that his living with her, which he owned, was by mutual agreement. This be per&s;i&s;ted in during the whole time of his confinement in goal, and even to the la&s;t; though he was often urged to confe&s;s the truth, and put in mind of the dreadful con&s;equence of going out of the world with a lie in his mouth. This has induced many to entertain hard thoughts of the woman, and to think more favourably of him: And many have &s;aid he ought not to have been hanged.</P>

<P>Again, let it be con&s;idered, that notwith&s;tanding he pretended to have renounced the errors of the church of Rome, yet he died a Papi&s;t. This appears from the te&s;timony of an intimate friend of his, of the &s;ame religion; who was with him
<PB N="24" REF="012375_0022_0F893F2E68AA8D90">
in goal, and attended him at the gallows. Now we know one tenet of the church of Rome is, that they are not obliged, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to perform their mo&s;t &s;olemn vows to Hereticks&punc; and he might po&s;&s;ibly think that if he might &s;wear fal&s;ely, he might doubtle&s;s &s;peak fal&s;ely to Hereticks, as they call all who&s;e religious principles differ from theirs.</P>
<P>Again, let it be con&s;idered that it appears evidently from &s;cripture, that God is &s;ometimes provoked to give heinous &s;inners up to blindne&s;s of mind and hard|ne&s;s of heart&mdash;to leave them to the power of their lu&s;ts and of the devil. When they commence devils&mdash;contract the temper of the infernal &s;pirits before they leave the world, and go to that place of puni&s;hment which is prepared for the devil and his angels. And when men are thus blinded and hardened, the mo|tives and arguments of religion, have little or no influence on them. And that <HI>Sheehen</HI> was &s;uch an one, there is great rea&s;on to believe, not only from his general character, and behaviour in goal, but al&s;o from what I am now going to relate.</P>
<P>Two credible per&s;ons have, &s;ince his execution, informed me, that there was a young woman, daughter of one <HI>Williams,</HI> of Gould&s;borough, in the Ea&s;tern part of this province, abu&s;ed in the &s;ame manner Mrs. <HI>Hollowell</HI> was. That &s;he was way-layed in the evening, between her father's hou&s;e and a neighbour's; was &s;eized, forced, and wounded to &s;uch a degree, that her friends were obliged to carry her home, &s;he being unable to walk, and that the next morning early &s;he died. That the villain, who perpetrated this crime, returned after he had done it, to his companions, who, it &s;eem, were before, or then, made acquainted with his enterprize; for &s;uch wretches declare their &s;in as Sodom: And that one of them told him he would probably have a child to maintain: He an&s;wered no, that he had taken care to prevent that, and that &s;he would never have a child by him, nor by any other man. That he was taken up, and confined in a private hou&s;e, they having no goal, and that after two or three days, he made his e&s;cape. My informers were, at that time, both of them, at a place very near to Gould&s;borough, heard the talk about the affair, and the man's name, and are pretty confident it was <HI>Bryan Sheehen.</HI> And they &s;ay, he was &s;aid to be an Iri&s;hman, and a married man, and that his wife was at Ca&s;co-Bay.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He mentioned to me his going a coa&s;ting from Ca&s;co to the Ea&s;tward, in a little boat owned by him and another man.</NOTE> Soon after this <HI>Sheehen</HI> left Ca&s;co-Bay (fearing, I imagine, he &s;hould be pur&s;ued and taken there) came to Marblehead, changed his name, and went a fi&s;hing from thence. While he was in goal, there was a man in town from Gould&s;borough, or &s;ome place adjacent, who was a&s;ked if he knew the man that abu&s;ed <HI>Williams</HI>'s daughter, in that cruel, fatal manner. He &s;aid he knew him well, that he had often &s;een him, and then de&s;cribed him: And the de&s;cription an&s;wered pretty exactly to <HI>Sheehen.</HI> He was told there was a man in goal, who &s;ome thought might be the &s;ame man. He went to the goal, &s;aw him, and when he returned, declared he was the &s;ame. Now if he was the man, and I think there is the highe&s;t proba+bility that he was; there can be no doubt of his guilt with re&s;pect to Mrs. <HI>Hol|lowell.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I was pre&s;ent when Mrs. <HI>Hollowell</HI> vi&s;ited him in goal after his condemnation, and ob&s;erved critically, not only what they &s;aid, but al&s;o their behaviour, and was of opinion that &s;he talked and behaved much more like an innocent per&s;on than he did.</NOTE> And as I would hope there are not many &s;uch mon&s;ters upon earth, &s;o I think it a favour that the earth is rid of him.</P>
<P>Let all hear, and fear and do no &s;uch wickedne&s;s. Oh con&s;ider the evil na|ture and dreadful con&s;equences of &s;in! Dreadful in this world, and infinitely more &s;o in the world to come. Exhort one another daily, le&s;t any be hardened thro' the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in.&mdash;hardened pa&s;t remedy&mdash;hardened to their ruin here, and eternal mi&s;ery hereafter.</P>
<P>Let women con&s;ider their danger from whoremongers and adulterers: And let them be &s;o far from tru&s;ting them&s;elves in their power, as to &s;hun and avoid them, as they would bears and tygers.</P>
<P>Let parents be careful to bring up their children in the fear of God. Let them con&s;ider of what va&s;t importance this is. That if they are neglected in childhood and youth, they may contract &s;uch habits of &s;inning, as it will be as hard for them to break off, as it is for the Ethiopian to change his &s;kin or the leopard his &s;pots; whereas if they are trained up in the way of religion, they will be likely never to depart from it.</P>
<Q><L>Whatever turn you give the infant mind,</L>
<L>That way 'twill ever after be inclin'd.</L></Q>
