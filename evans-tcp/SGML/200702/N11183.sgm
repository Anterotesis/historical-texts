<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Subjects,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am at pre&s;ent on a journey of bu&s;ine&s;s in America, yet, being one of the people of Great-Britain, to whom you addre&s;s your&s;elves in congre&s;s, I thought it my duty to peru&s;e your addre&s;s with as much at|ten&s;ion as the nature of my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s would permit; and having &s;o done, I beg leave to addre&s;s you in an&s;wer to it. But as the nature of my bu&s;ine&s;s will not permit me to de|vote &s;o much time to it, as would be nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;cribe your particular pa&s;&s;ages, verbatim, and then to an&s;wer them at large; I would reque&s;t that your addre&s;s to us may lay be|fore you, while you read what I &s;hall write on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>When a nation, led to greatne&s;s by the hand of liberty, turns advocate for &s;lavery, there, doubtle&s;s, mu&s;t be great rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, either, that virtue is fled, or that negligence in the appointment of rulers has crept in; but I mu&s;t not be &s;o ha&s;ty as to charge Britain with this, till I proceed farther into your addre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="014159_0003_0F9333BC887DEB70">Our ance&s;tors, in almo&s;t every age (if you mean &s;ince they have been a di&s;tinct kingdom) have indeed, during both foreign and civil wars, maintained their independence (if you mean with re&s;pect to any other &s;tate in point of government) and I am happy in agreeing with you, that they tran&s;mitted their rights and liberties to us their po&s;terity: Neither am I &s;urprized, that you, who are de&s;cended from the &s;ame ance&s;tors, and en|titled to the &s;ame rights,
<Q>&s;hould refu&s;e to &s;urrender them to men, who found their claim on no principles of rea&s;on, and who pro&s;ecute them, with a de&s;ign, that by having your lives and property in their power, they may with the great|er felicity en&s;lave us.</Q>
The cau&s;e of America, is indeed an object of univer&s;al attention; and it is really become very &s;erious; but I am in a great mea&s;ure unacquainted with the oppre&s;&s;ions, abu&s;es, and mi&s;repre&s;entations, which you &s;peak of; and though you a&s;&s;ure us, that you are led to addre&s;s us, by a dutiful re&s;pect for our general welfare, yet, till I get fur|ther on in your addre&s;s, I &s;hall not join with you in tho&s;e ap|prehen&s;ions of &s;lavery, which you &s;ay is intended for you and for us.</P>
<P>I, and I believe, all my fellow-&s;ubjects in Great-Britain, con&s;ider, that you are, and ought to be as free as us, and that you are entitled to all the benefits of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, a trial by jury, and a hearing in your defence. I think, with you, that the legi&s;lature of Great-Britain, is not authorized to e&s;tabli&s;h an impious religion, or an arbitrary form of govern|ment; but till I have advanced farther, I cannot join with you that the&s;e &s;acred rights have been &s;o frequently and flagrantly violated.</P>
<P>The proprietors of the &s;oil of Great-Britain, are, indeed, lords of their own property, &s;ubject only to the regulations of the legi&s;lature; but the legi&s;lature has power to di&s;po&s;e of any part or all of it, without the con&s;ent of the owner; and this power they do exerci&s;e, when they judge it nece&s;&s;ary for the pub|lic good; had they not, we never &s;hould have had that elegant avenue to Black Frier's bridge, or the numerous navigable ca|nals made, and now making, all through the kingdom; but I would not be under&s;tood to &s;ay, that they ever exerci&s;e it with|out giving the owner its hone&s;t value, unle&s;s he be ob&s;tinate and will not receive it, which I might &s;ay is &s;ometimes, tho' not very often, the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The proprietors of the &s;oil of America, are no le&s;s lords of their property than we are of ours, neither is there any rea&s;on that you &s;hould &s;ubmit it to the di&s;po&s;al of our parliament, pro|vided
<PB N="5" REF="014159_0004_0F9333BD233949C8">
our parliament be not your parliament al&s;o. The in|tervention of the &s;ea that divides us, can in my opinion cau&s;e no di&s;parity of rights, neither can any rea&s;on be given, why Engli&s;h &s;ubjects who live three thou&s;and miles from the Royal Palace, &s;hould enjoy le&s;s liberty than tho&s;e who live three hundred miles from it; and, <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI> (for it cannot be a good rule unle&s;s it works both ways) no rea&s;on can be given, why they &s;hould enjoy more.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on looks with indignation on &s;uch di&s;tinctions, and as I am a freeman I cannot perceive their propriety. But yet you &s;ay, that the parliament a&s;&s;erts, that it has "authority to bind you in all ca&s;es without exception, whether you con&s;ent or not." I grant that it does a&s;&s;ert that it has full power and authority to bind you in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. And now let us con&s;ider on what this a&s;&s;ertion is founded.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the parliament con&s;ider you to be a part of the Briti&s;h empire or &s;tate: Entitled to all the privileges of Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, capable of holding any office of profit, tru&s;t, or honour, in Great-Britain, and of &s;etting in parliament: Entitled to the protection of the Briti&s;h fleets and armies, and to every benefit which accrues to members of that &s;ociety.</P>
<P>And Secondly, the parliament con&s;ider them&s;elves to be the legi&s;lature of that empire, (con&s;equently to be our parliament, and your parliament, and the parliament of every other Briti&s;h &s;ubject,) who&s;e duty it is to make laws, to regulate the mem|bers of that empire, for the common good of the whole, and to affix and determine for each of the re&s;pective parts, &s;uch orbs, as that the motion of one part, &s;hall not retard the motion of another part; and to make provi&s;ion out of the whole, for the &s;upport and maintenance of a &s;ufficient force, to protect, &s;e|cure, and defend, every of the re&s;pective parts, in their re&s;pec|tive orbs, again&s;t the force of all its enemies, whether foreign or dome&s;tic, &s;o that the whole &s;hall form one regular, &s;trong, and la&s;ting &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that an empire compo&s;ed of &s;everal parts, &s;hould be without an imperial legi&s;lature to re|gulate and bind the whole; for without &s;uch a legi&s;lature, the whole could not be con&s;idered together, and regulated as one empire. To &s;uppo&s;e then that America is not to be bound by the &s;tatutes of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, and that too in all re&s;pects, mu&s;t confound every idea of its being part and parcel of the Briti&s;h empire&punc; mu&s;t invalidate your claims to the be|nefit which accrue to members of that empire or &s;ociety; and totally de&s;troy your title to the protection of the Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and armies.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="014159_0005_0F9333BDDCA9C8A8">It is true, it might neverthele&s;s be a part of the dominions of the King (but not of the imperial crown) of Great-Britain, in which ca&s;e you would be in the &s;ame &s;tate (with re&s;pect to our &s;ociety) as his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in Hanover are; but give me leave to a&s;k, are his Maje&s;ty's Hanoverian &s;ubjects entitled to partake of the benefits of the Briti&s;h &s;ociety in any re&s;pect whatever? Surely not.</P>
<P>Would you &s;ay, that your Royal charters give you the rights and privileges of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, and declare that you &s;hall always be e&s;teemed as members of the Briti&s;h &s;ociety? But even if the King's charter was &s;ufficient for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, each of you, as are not in charter-governments, could not make this plea.&mdash;But let me a&s;k again, is it in his Maje&s;ty's power to give his foreign &s;ubjects (for in&s;tance his Hanoverian &s;ubjects) the privileges of Engli&s;hmen? Surely not: He may, it is true, give them privileges among them&s;elves, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which are enjoyed by his Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, but cannot make them partakers of the privileges of the Briti&s;h &s;ociety. He cannot make them capable of holding any office in Britain, or of &s;itting in the Briti&s;h parliament, neither can he entitle them to the protection of the Briti&s;h forces. Nothing but the legi&s;lature can give them tho&s;e privileges, or receive them into that &s;ociety; nor could any thing be more ab&s;urd, than to &s;uppo&s;e, that any per&s;on &s;hould be capable of &s;itting in parlia|ment, but &s;uch as are a part of that &s;ociety, over which the parliament pre&s;ides. That the Americans do both claim and enjoy this privilege, I could give many in&s;tances, but I &s;hall mention only two, viz: Mr. Beckford and Mr. Trecothick, both of which &s;erved the office of Lord Mayor of the city of London, 1770, and both were Repre&s;entatives for the city of London in parliament, both tho&s;e Gentlemen were Americans. Seeing therefore, that the Americans are capable of &s;itting in parliament, they mu&s;t be a part of that &s;ociety, over which the parliament pre&s;ides.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it appears, that your title to tho&s;e privileges does not flow from your charters in the lea&s;t degree, but is in fact this; you were a part of the Briti&s;h &s;ociety previous to your emigration; you emigrated under the &s;eal of the em+pire, or imperial &s;eal of that &s;ociety (which &s;urely could not be of any the lea&s;t validity in Hanover, or el&s;ewhere out of the empire;) nor did you emigrate to form a new &s;ociety, but to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a part of that &s;ociety, to which you had ever belonged; and &s;uch of you as emigrated from other nations, were received into the Briti&s;h &s;ociety by virtue of an act of parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014159_0006_0F9333BEDE67C870">Seeing then that you were at that time under the authority of parliament, and that you have ever remained a part of the &s;ame &s;ociety; and &s;eeing al&s;o, that the parliament never relin|qui&s;hed its authority over you, how is it po&s;&s;ible that you can be exempt from it now? Would you &s;ay, that you emigrated to a country over which the parliament or imperial legi&s;lature had no authority? But this, as I &s;aid before, de&s;troys every idea of its being part and parcel of the Briti&s;h empire:&mdash;For, to be a part of the empire, lying out of the juri&s;diction of the imperial legi&s;lature, would be a mo&s;t palpable ab&s;urdity, fairly affronting to common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>But let us con&s;ider whether the authority of the parliament, or imperial legi&s;lature &s;hould in rea&s;on extend hither or not&mdash; The legi&s;lature at the expence of the nation, fits out a fleet, and &s;ends it on di&s;coveries: They di&s;cover a new country, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the u&s;ual manner, by hoi&s;ting the flag of the nation thereon:&mdash;Quere, then does it become the private domains of the King? or does it become a part and parcel of the imperial dominions, the &s;ame as though it had not been &s;eparated from the old dominions by the &s;ea? Surely the latter. The intervention of the &s;ea can cau&s;e no de&s;parity, rea&s;on would look with indignation on &s;uch di&s;tinctions.&mdash; Should it be obtained by con&s;ent from a foreign nation, (which was the ca&s;e with &s;everal of the colonies) the only difference would be that the expence mu&s;t be the greater.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that the Engli&s;h con&s;titution is &s;uch, that the &s;ubject &s;hall not be bound by any laws, or pay any taxes, without his con&s;ent, given either by him&s;elf, or his repre&s;entative, by him cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e: That America has no vote in &s;uch elections, and therefore cannot be con&s;titutionally bound by &s;uch laws.</P>
<P>But in this the Engli&s;h con&s;titution is gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented: The Engli&s;h government being a mixed one differs from a monarchy (or any other &s;ingle con&s;titution of government,) only in this, that in a monarchy, the Prince is in him&s;elf the &s;upreme legi&s;lature, (as is the Nobles in Ari&s;tocracy, and the elected in a Democracy,) and in our mixed government, the &s;upreme legi&s;lature is compo&s;ed of all three, viz. the King, the Lords, and the Commons in parliament; and the con&s;titution is this, that the two fir&s;t of the&s;e branches &s;hall be hereditary, and that the third &s;hall be cho&s;en, by and out of the com|mons: To wit, that the counties of Middle&s;ex, Surrey, &amp; &s;hall &s;end two members each, which &s;hall be elected by a ma|jority of &s;uch of the freeholders of the county, as choo&s;e to
<PB N="8" REF="014159_0007_0F9333BF5985FB38">
attend and vote at the election. That &s;uch and &s;uch cities and towns &s;hall &s;end two members each (the city of London &s;ends four) which &s;hall be elected by a majority of the free|men of &s;uch city or town: That &s;uch and &s;uch towns &s;hall &s;end two members each, which &s;hall be elected by the majority of the corporation in &s;uch town; and here give me leave to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome towns which contain &s;everal thou&s;and inhabitants, have not twenty voters; and many large towns (of which Birmingham, Sheffield and Manche&s;ter are three, the &s;malle&s;t of which is larger than the large&s;t city or town in America) &s;end no members at all; and a large part of South|wark, who&s;e hou&s;es were pulled down by authority of parlia|ment, to make that elegant avenue to Black-Fryars bridge, is al&s;o without the privilege of voting; and upon the whole, there is not one thirtieth part of the people of Great-Britain, that are entitled to vote in the elections. This is the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, with re&s;pect to the commons repre&s;entatives in parliament, notwith&s;tanding the many mi&s;repre&s;entations of it among the common people of America.&mdash;Neither do the&s;e commons repre&s;ent that part in which they are elected, more than they do any and every other part of the empire:&mdash; Forty of them make a hou&s;e of parliament; and the King, the majority of the lords, and the majority of commons repre|&s;entatives, are by our con&s;titution the repre&s;entatives of the whole empire, and by that con&s;titution are empowered to make laws, which &s;hall be binding, on every part of the empire&punc; Not only on every &s;ubject of the empire, but al&s;o on the per|&s;on of the King, and on the Imperial-Crown it&s;elf.&mdash;For how came we by our pre&s;ent gracious &s;overeign? by an act of par|liament, which placed the crown on the head of his royal ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee that upwards of twenty-nine thirtieth parts of the people of Great-Britain are in the &s;ame &s;ituation as you are, with re&s;pect to election, and repre&s;entation. &mdash;They con|&s;ent no more to the laws which are made, or to the taxes which are laid by parliament than you do,&mdash;The only thing to which they in reality give their con&s;ent, is this, they con&s;ent to be Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, &mdash;To be con&s;idered as a part of the Briti&s;h &s;ociety, and to be governed according to the con&s;ti|tution thereof: Which is, in effect, con&s;enting to be governed by &s;uch laws as &s;hall be made, and to pay &s;uch taxes as &s;hall be laid, by tho&s;e whom the con&s;titution has empowered to make the laws, and to lay the taxes. And this kind of con&s;ent is as much given by you as by us. Shall we &s;ay then, that this is
<PB N="9" REF="014159_0008_0F9333C14FE8EBF8">
uncon&s;titutional? Surely not. It is the very con&s;titution it&s;elf. That this part of the con&s;titution might be altered for the bet|ter, I would very readily grant, and I &s;hould be happy in &s;ee|ing an equal repre&s;entation of the commons of the whole em|pire in parliament; but I could never &s;uppo&s;e it con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on or the common good, to be without a &s;upreme &s;overeign legi&s;lature over the whole, which &s;hould have au|thority to bind every part of the empire; for without that, it would be impo&s;&s;ible that the whole &s;hould be regulated for the common good, which is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point in govern|ment.&mdash;This equal repre&s;entation, however, cannot be had without an alteration in that part of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution: and by the bye, a con&s;titution of an empire is too great a thing to be tampered with.&mdash;Alterations in a thing of &s;uch va&s;t importance, &s;hould never be made, but with the greate&s;t and coole&s;t con&s;ideration, and never attempted while the heats of party prejudices actuates the mind, le&s;t, in&s;tead of being mended, it &s;hould be made far wor&s;e.</P>
<P>It is alledged too, that if the Parliament have authority in America, they can, if they will, lay on &s;uch burdens as would inevitably en&s;lave you;&mdash;but &s;urely it is time enough to complain, when they lay on you more than your propor|tion, which none of you have ever yet pretended to accu&s;e them of.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of your Buccaneers, will furni&s;h you with am|ple accounts of the piracies in your &s;eas formerly;&mdash;What el&s;e but the Briti&s;h fleets protects your trade now from tho&s;e pirates? Or what el&s;e protects your coa&s;ts in time of war from the enemy?&mdash;A time of peace is the only time to prepare for war;&mdash;What kind of title then would you have to the pro|tection of our fleets in time of war, unle&s;s you pay a propor|tion of the expence of the preparations which are made in time of peace? Would it not be extremely unju&s;t, that the Parliament &s;hould lay taxes on us, to build &s;hips, or to &s;up|port a fleet, to protect your trade from pirates in time of peace, or to defend your coa&s;ts from the enemy in time of war, was it not that you were a part of our &s;ociety, under their authority and protection, and that they laid a part of the expence on you al&s;o?</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, the Parliament could, if they were &s;o evil minded, de&s;troy or en&s;lave you:&mdash;But what kind of rea&s;oning is this?&mdash;So al&s;o if a man be permitted to walk about at large, he could, if he was &s;o evil minded, kill another man that he might meet with:&mdash;If, therefore, it be &s;aid, that the Parlia|ment
<PB N="10" REF="014159_0009_0F9333C18B247E48">
ought not to have authority, le&s;t it &s;hould mi&s;-u&s;e it; it will follow, by the &s;ame rule, that every man ought to be kept pen'd up in &s;ome little apartment by him&s;elf, le&s;t he &s;hould fall foul on his neighbour. Strange times the&s;e! But let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e both the&s;e ab&s;urdities to happen (for the one is ju&s;t as rea&s;onable as the other) who, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e is to regulate the &s;tate? and in the &s;econd ca&s;e, where in the name of good luck do we find the gaoler?</P>
<P>But let us enquire, whether you did not always, till of late, con&s;ider your&s;elves to be under the &s;upreme authority of Par|liament, and whether the Parliament did not al&s;o con&s;ider you in the &s;elf &s;ame light?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t colonization patent worth notice, was (if I re|member right) granted by King James the fir&s;t, to the Vir|ginia company, in the year 1606, which covered all the lands from Carolina to Nova-Scotia; and though that Prince would willingly have been ab&s;olute over tho&s;e countries, yet &s;o far were the then Hou&s;e of Commons, from &s;uppo&s;ing that the parliamentary authority did not extend to Virginia, that we find the Virginia affairs in that Hou&s;e &s;o early as the year 1614; wherein the Commons firmly a&s;&s;erted the authority of Parliament over tho&s;e countries, and only three of the mem|bers who made the lea&s;t doubt of its authority, and the&s;e quickly altered their opinions.&mdash;So great an unanimity is &s;carcely ever to be found in that Hou&s;e.&mdash;And &s;o far were the fir&s;t &s;ettlers from &s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves to be out of the autho|rity of Parliament, that we find in the Hou&s;e of Commons, a petition to Parliament from the inhabitants of Virginia, &s;o early as the year 1621.&mdash;But as this, and the next reign, is generally &s;poken of with di&s;like in many parts of America, e&s;pecially in the New-England governments, I will look into the Common-Wealth Parliament, under Oliver Cromwell, in the time of the great rebellion. In this Parliament we find in act pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1650&punc; declaring, to all intents and purpo&s;es the authority of the Parliament over the colonies; and &s;o far were the people of New-England from denying their authority, that (though the &s;outhern provinces declared for King Charles the &s;econd) they (in New-England) joined with the Common-wealth's-men; and even to this day, many of them, (who are now mo&s;t inveterate again&s;t Parlia|ment) &s;peak of Cromwell with the highe&s;t veneration and e&s;teem.&mdash;In the charter for Penn&s;ylvania, which was granted about two years after the Re&s;toration of King Charles the &s;econd, the King gives up the idea of ab&s;olute dominion (which his grand-father in all probability aimed at, in Virgi|nia)
<PB N="11" REF="014159_0010_0F9333C24425DFD8">
but he expre&s;sly re&s;erves the power of taxing them, with either "the con&s;ent of the Proprietor, or chief governor, or A&s;&s;embly, or by act of Parliament in England."&mdash;In this reign, nay, in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament after the Re&s;to|ration, we find an act regulating the &s;hipping trade of the colonies, in which the words "Engli&s;hmen and Engli&s;h &s;hip|ping," are explained to mean all the &s;hipping and all the &s;ub|jects of the Briti&s;h empire, in Europe, A&s;ia, Africa, and America.&mdash;And in the twenty-fifth of this reign, an act was pa&s;&s;ed, laying duties in the colonies on &s;ugar, tobacco, cotton-wool, indigo, ginger, logwood, &amp;c. So far were the&s;e Parliaments from doubting their authority over America. But as this reign is &s;poken of by &s;ome of the people here, with no great e&s;teem, I will leave it, and look into the reign of King William and Queen Mary, after the glorious Revolution; a reign which is generally &s;poken of, with the highe&s;t approbation in America.&mdash;In the &s;eventh and eighth of this reign, we find it enacted, that every &s;eaman, in every of the &s;hips belonging either to his Maje&s;ty, or any of his &s;ubjects, in any of his dominions, &s;hall give &s;ix-pence per year out of their wages, to the revenue of Greenwich Ho&s;pi|tal; which tax has been ever &s;ince, and now is, levied in the colonies, by virtue of this act.&mdash;In the act "for preventing frauds and regulating abu&s;es in the plantations," which pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame year, all former acts re&s;pecting the colonies are renewed and enforced, and the &s;hips in the colonies are &s;ubjected to the &s;ame regulations as the &s;hips in the ports of England, and the revenue-officers have the &s;ame powers to to vi&s;it and &s;earch &s;hips, as the officers of the cu&s;toms in Eng|land, and the like a&s;&s;i&s;tance is given to them, with power to give this or other cu&s;tom acts in evidence, and the judges to allow thereof.&mdash;Owners of land too, are by this act, prohi|bitted from &s;elling them without licence from his Maje&s;ty, to any other per&s;on than a natural born &s;ubject.&mdash;But the main matter expre&s;&s;ive of the authority of Parliament in all ca&s;es, is the ninth &s;ection of this act, which &s;ays,
<Q>All laws, by-laws, u&s;ages or cu&s;toms, at this time, or which hereafter &s;hall be in practi&s;e, or endeavoured or pretended to be in force or practice, in any of the &s;aid plantations, which are in any wi&s;e repugnant to the before mentioned laws or any of them, &s;o far as they do relate to the &s;aid planta|tions, or any of them; or which are any ways repugnant to this pre&s;ent act, or to any other law hereafter to be made in this kingdom, &s;o far as &s;uch law &s;hall relate to,
<PB N="12" REF="014159_0011_0F9333C32A720338">
and mention the &s;aid plantations, are illegal, null and void, to all intents and purpo&s;es what&s;oever.</Q>
&mdash;So far was this highly and ju&s;tly e&s;teemed Prince, and the other branches of his Parliament, from doubting their authority over the colonies.&mdash;I might mention other acts, in this, and every &s;ub&s;equent reign: among others, the act for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the po&s;t-office, which is expre&s;sly declared to be for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue in America, and which, not|with&s;tanding, met with high approbation here:&mdash;The acts laying duties on wine, &s;ugar, mola&s;&s;es, &amp;c. which al&s;o met with no oppo&s;ition.&mdash;In &s;hort, there is &s;carce a &s;e&s;|&s;ion of Parliament &s;ince William and Mary's reign, to the pre&s;ent time, but what contains more or le&s;s of the &s;upreme authority over the colonies; but I forbear &s;aying any more of the acts or opinions of the Parliament, and &s;hall next con&s;ider the opinions of the colonies, &s;o lately as the year 1755.&mdash;The colonies were at this time, under the mo&s;t direful apprehen|&s;ions of being de&s;troyed by the French.&mdash;The A&s;&s;embly of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, in a me&s;&s;age to Governor Shirley, the fourth of January, 1754, &s;ay (among other things) that the French have made &s;uch encroachments, and taken &s;uch mea|&s;ures,
<Q>as threaten great danger, and perhaps in time, even the entire de&s;truction of this province, (without the inter|po&s;ition of his Maje&s;ty) notwith&s;tanding any provi&s;ion we can make to prevent it.</Q>
&mdash;The A&s;&s;embly of Virginia too, in the &s;ame year, addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty, informing him, that they have rai&s;ed ten thou&s;and pounds;&mdash;that that &s;um is not &s;ufficient, but that they are unable to rai&s;e more, and therefore pray his Maje&s;ty to extend his royal beneficence.</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee the inability of America to defend her&s;elf again&s;t the French and Canadians (exclu&s;ive of the &s;ea-coa&s;ts&punc; which mu&s;t be defended by fleets) and now let me a&s;k, how could his Maje&s;ty give them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, without his Par|liament? And would it not be the highe&s;t inju&s;tice, for the Parliament to take our money, and give it to the King, for your u&s;e, provided you was not a part of us, and equally with us, under their authority and protection?</P>
<P>The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts A&s;&s;embly in another me&s;&s;age to Gover|nor Shirley, in April 1754, &s;ay,
<Q>It evidently appears, that the French are far advanced in the execution of a plan which hath been laid more than fifty years, for extending their &s;ettlements, &amp;c. and for &s;ubjecting the whole conti|nent to the crown of France.&mdash;That the French have but one intere&s;t, and keep one point in view.&mdash;That the Engli&s;h
<PB N="13" REF="014159_0012_0F9333C3FA684158">
governments have different intere&s;ts, are di&s;united, &s;ome of them have their frontiers covered by their neighbouring governments, and not being immediately affected, &s;eem unconcerned.</Q></P>
<P>The Congre&s;s, from the &s;everal colonies which met at Al|bany, in July 1754, among other things &s;ay,
<Q>That the &s;aid colonies being in a divided di&s;united &s;tate, there has never been any joint exertion of their forces or councils to repel or defeat the mea&s;ures of the French, and particular colonies are unable, and unwilling to maintain the cau&s;e of the whole.</Q></P>
<P>I have not time to tran&s;cribe the&s;e pieces at large, but I would humbly recommend my readers to procure and peru&s;e them.</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee an example of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of there being in every empire, a &s;upreme power that &s;hall command the whole; but the main matter which I &s;hall mention, as declaratory of the opinions of the colonies, with re&s;pect not only of the authority of parliament to bind you, but al&s;o of the nece&s;&s;ity of putting that authority in execution, we &s;hall find in the proceedings of the convention of Committees from the &s;everal provinces, who met at Albany in the year 1755. Governor Shirley (who was held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem, not only by his province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, but by the other colonies al&s;o) pre&s;ented a plan to the&s;e Committees, propo&s;ing a proportionable a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment on their &s;everal colonies, and in order to compel all the colonies to comply, he propo&s;ed as part of his plan, that application &s;hould be made to parlia|ment, for an act to empower the Committees of the &s;everal colonies, to tax the whole, according to their re&s;pective pro|portions; and to this the Committees agreed. And I find in the journals of the New-York A&s;&s;embly, March 27, 1755. When this plan was laid before a Committee of each of their hou&s;es, they re&s;olved, that governor Shirley's &s;cheme was well conceited, and that (if his Maje&s;ty's general &s;hould approve thereof) that colony joined therein; and when the Committee reported it to the hou&s;e, the hou&s;e re&s;olved the &s;ame, <HI>Nemine Contradicente.</HI> So far were the&s;e Committees, and this A&s;&s;em|bly, at that time, from &s;uppo&s;ing that they were out of the authority of parliament.</P>
<P>Thus my fellow &s;ubjects have I con&s;idered the grounds, on which the parliament founded tho&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, which you &s;o much di&s;like: I have &s;hewn the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of there being a &s;upreme power to bind the whole empire; not only
<PB N="14" REF="014159_0013_0F9333C6D800C298">
on doctrinal principles, but al&s;o by giving a proof of it, in a matter, which has within your own memory, happened among your&s;elves; and which in all probability may happen again, and often: I have &s;hewn al&s;o, that that &s;upreme power mu&s;t be in the Briti&s;h parliament, &s;o long as you are a part of the Briti&s;h empire: I have al&s;o &s;hewn, that the parliament ever claimed it, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the colonies until now, and that they have ever exerci&s;ed it, in &s;ome point or other; and I have al&s;o &s;hewn, that you were of the &s;ame opinion with them, even &s;o lately as the late war; from whence your claim of exemption is but of a very &s;hort date. I mu&s;t therefore conclude, that their declarations can by no means be con&s;ider|ed as "here&s;ies in Engli&s;h politics."</P>
<P>Though I &s;o firmly a&s;&s;ert the authority of parliament, yet I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that when the heats and prejudices of the pre&s;ent times abate, you will not accu&s;e me of being an ene|my to America. I could heartily wi&s;h to &s;ee (as I &s;aid before) an equal repre&s;entation of the commons of the whole empire in parliament. I &s;hould be happy in &s;eeing repre&s;entatives from Birmingham, Sheffield and Manche&s;ter, &amp;c. and the old depopulated boroughs cea&s;e to &s;end. I could al&s;o wi&s;h to &s;ee members from America, in both hou&s;es of parliament, &s;o that America might have its &s;hare in the general legi&s;lature, which revolving often into the hands of the electors here, would give you the &s;ame &s;ecurity for your liberties, as your fellow &s;ubjects in England have; but your unhappy ca&s;e in 1754-5, was there nothing el&s;e to be con&s;idered, would be &s;ufficient to convince one of the ab&s;urdity of being without a &s;upreme legi&s;lature to command the whole.</P>
<P>After this equal repre&s;entation, I &s;hould even then, be far from wi&s;hing the parliament to exerci&s;e her authority in in|ternal taxation. If I might wi&s;h it, they &s;hould only regulate the &s;tate, and (appoint Committees if they were not &s;ufficient|ly acquainted them&s;elves,) to a&s;certain the proportion which each colony ought to pay, and make laws, compelling the &s;e|veral A&s;&s;emblies to rai&s;e it, and on failure thereof (but not otherwi&s;e) to empower officers to a&s;&s;e&s;s it, in &s;ome certain man|ner which they &s;hould judge mo&s;t meet, according to the &s;e|cond plan which governor Shirley in the year 1755, propo&s;ed for that purpo&s;e; and then the A&s;&s;emblies &s;hould rai&s;e it in any manner they &s;hould think be&s;t. My rea&s;ons for this, is, that the parliament could not (at lea&s;t would not be &s;o likely to) know on what to lay an internal tax, &s;o as that it might be the lea&s;t burthen po&s;&s;ible on tho&s;e who are to pay it; which
<PB N="15" REF="014159_0014_0F9333C7C991A178">
is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential thing to be con&s;idered in laying a tax.&mdash; But with re&s;pect to commercial duties, the&s;e cannot be laid with judgment, by any other than the general or &s;upreme legi&s;lature, becau&s;e no other can &s;ee how to regulate commerce in &s;uch an exten&s;ive commercial empire, &s;o that it &s;hall on the whole, produce the greate&s;t trade and advantages; which is al&s;o the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential thing to be con&s;idered in laying tho&s;e duties.</P>
<P>Though the latter end of the late war, conducted under the able Earl of Chatham, was exceedingly victorious, yet I can|not conceive the peace to have been &s;o inglorious a one, as &s;ome may imagine. It might perhaps have been made more beneficial to this empire, if the war had been continued longer; but the fate of war is &s;o uncertain, that there was a <HI>perhaps al&s;o,</HI> that it might have turned out otherwi&s;e. You well know that the war was extremely expen&s;ive and long, and the burthens of it began to be very &s;en&s;ibly felt.</P>
<P>I have made diligent &s;earch for the plan, which you &s;ay was at this time formed for en&s;laving America, but I have not been able to find, that it ever had any exi&s;tence, but in ungenerous imaginations.</P>
<P>Prior to this Aera, it is true, nothing but &s;mall duties on merchandize, had been laid in America, but as the riches of any part of the empire increa&s;es, &s;o al&s;o ought their taxes to in|crease, that all parts may pay towards the common &s;ecurity, in proportion to their wealth.</P>
<P>I remember your loyalty in the la&s;t war, and if you will take the trouble to read the pieces I before alluded to, you will find, that you then declared, that all the &s;trength of this va&s;t continent (as you now expre&s;s it,) was in&s;ufficient to pro|tect your own frontiers, let alone your coa&s;ts!&mdash;You prayed Britain to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, and to remove your enemy from your backs&punc; She, like a tender and affectionate parent, heard your complaints, and granted your reque&s;ts. She protected your coa&s;ts. She &s;ent you part of her fleets and armies to join your &s;trength, and to remove your enemy. Nor was &s;he &s;paring in her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but finally they were, and are removed.</P>
<P>Many (though not all) of your provinces, (I &s;ay it with re&s;pect) exerted them&s;elves with that loyalty which did them honour, and though their &s;trength was &s;mall, yet it was &s;uf|ficient to &s;hew their willingne&s;s.</P>
<P>When the war was ended, and the enemy removed, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;ums you had contributed, were but a &s;mall part of the expence which attended your own &s;ecurity and protec|tion,
<PB N="16" REF="014159_0015_0F9333C9CDE25A10">
yet &s;eeing that you had advanced more than what was proportionable to your abilities, with re&s;pect to ours; the par|liament con&s;idering you as a part of us, and equally under their protection and authority, refunded the overplus of your pro|portions, as you frankly acknowledge. This, my fellow &s;ub|jects, I conceive to be proof, and that too, a very high one, of the principles, the equity, and the honor of that nation, and its legi&s;lature, which you now treat with the utmo&s;t ingrati|tude and contempt.</P>
<P>I have already given it as my opinion, that it would be mo&s;t proper that the A&s;&s;emblies of the &s;everal provinces, &s;hould lay their internal taxes them&s;elves. Among the&s;e the Stamp-act might be reckoned; but though I &s;hall not be an advo|cate for the Stamp-act, but on the other hand, &s;hall acknow|ledge that the execution of it, might have been prejudicial to the new &s;ettlers in your interior countries, who, from their &s;ituation, could not have opportunity of getting &s;tamps, with|out hurting them&s;elves much more than the tax could do the crown good; yet, give me leave to ob&s;erve, that an act like that within proper re&s;trictions, might be a means of much &s;er|vice to many parts of America, by contributing to le&s;&s;en a mo&s;t vile de&s;tructive &s;pirit of litigation, under the oppre&s;&s;ion of which, the New-England governments fairly groan.</P>
<P>The Stamp-act, however was repealed, and that too (I be|lieve) upon the principle of its being likely to be prejudicial to particular parts, which Doctor Franklin explained to the hou&s;e of commons.</P>
<P>The duty on Paint, Gla&s;s, &amp;c. was perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with Doctor Franklin's own arguments, while he was &s;olicit|ing the repeal of the Stamp-act. The Doctor (whom I much e&s;teem on many accounts, though I cannot agree with him in all things) at that time, declared to the hou&s;e of commons, that the parliament had an equitable and ju&s;t right to lay a duty on the merchandize, which was carried acro&s;s the &s;eas, becau&s;e (as he told them) it was their fleets, at their expence, which kept the &s;eas clear of Pirates, and maintained the &s;afety of the carriage. For the truth of this, I refer you to Doctor Franklin's examination before the hou&s;e of commons, pub|li&s;hed about the time of the repeal of the Stamp-act.</P>
<P>Another main argument u&s;ed by Doctor Franklin, and by mo&s;t people in America, to wit
<Q>that no man &s;hould pay a tax to which he does not con&s;ent, either in his own per&s;on, or by his repre&s;entative;</Q>
would remain in its fulle&s;t force, without the lea&s;t infringement, by this mode of rai&s;ing a re|venue
<PB N="17" REF="014159_0016_0F9333CADC9C6EB0">
(unle&s;s indeed the duties &s;hould be laid on the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;aries of life;) becau&s;e every man is left to his own choice whether he will purcha&s;e the dutiable articles or not, and con|&s;equently cannot pay the duty without his own con&s;ent in per&s;on. Did not this fully prove that the grand legi&s;lature of the empire was willing, nay was de&s;irous, and determined, to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures only, as they had the greate&s;t rea&s;ons (from the mouth of your agent) to believe, would not be di&s;|agreeable to your own &s;entiments? And this was no all, they repealed this act too, &s;o far as it related to what may be called conveniences, viz. Paint, Gla&s;s, &amp;c. and left unrepealed in this act, only a very &s;mall duty on tea, which is &s;urely one of the &s;uperfluities of life. So far were the&s;e their proceedings from de&s;erving tho&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, which you &s;o ungenerou&s;ly throw out again&s;t them, of being unju&s;t, uncon&s;titutional, &amp;c. that they were perfectly agreeable with every of your then arguments.</P>
<P>How incon&s;i&s;tent then, how repugnant to your former words and declarations, has your late ungrateful conduct been!&mdash; Surely a &s;pirited nation cannot put up with &s;uch in&s;ults. But behold you now make new arguments, which were not at that time thought of, and which have nothing but ab&s;urdity for their foundation. Unhappy! extremely unhappy indeed, &s;hould we all be, if the legi&s;lature were like you, &s;o continu|ally changing with the wind!</P>
<P>How any of the revenues here are applied, I know not, but thus much I know, that your trade is &s;till protected from Pi|rates by the Briti&s;h fleets, and the&s;e mu&s;t be &s;upported from &s;omewhere, nor have I any rea&s;on to doubt, but the&s;e reve|nues are applied for that or &s;ome &s;imilar purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Though I am ready to believe that you have generally rai&s;|ed money for the &s;upport of your particular, internal govern|ments, yet I mu&s;t take the liberty of ob&s;erving, that your de|claration is not true in all re&s;pects. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a&s;&s;em|bly refu&s;ed to make the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of their fortre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding they e&s;teemed it both their in|tere&s;t and their duty, and were urged to do it very &s;trongly by many of their members;) or el&s;e Ca&s;tle William in the bay of Bo&s;ton, would not (in all probability) have been taken into the hands of the King; neither do they alledge any thing for their rea&s;on, but the exerci&s;e of what they them&s;elves acknow|ledge to have been the legal prerogative of the governor, in adjourning the a&s;&s;embly to Cambridge. I could mention other failures, but it is unnece&s;&s;ary. How much you would
<PB N="18" REF="014159_0017_0F9333CB9D4F9210">
do for the &s;tate (if left to your&s;elves) is uncertain, your own affairs in 1754-5, pretty evidently &s;how, that you would not agree in it, be the exigences ever &s;o great.</P>
<P>The laws re&s;pecting the revenue are much the &s;ame (I &s;up|po&s;e) as they are in England; be they what they may, the fair trader is not endangered by them; but many of our towns are &s;o addicted to &s;muggling, that they &s;hrink not at vio|lating the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations, to an&s;wer &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es; and the inward conviction of your guilt, I take to be the only rea&s;on why you &s;o highly dread the rod. Your other laws too, I &s;uppo&s;e, are much the &s;ame as ours.</P>
<P>The carrying offenders from here to England for trial, would doubtle&s;s be extremely bad, was it to be u&s;ed as a gene|ral practice; but &s;urely you will allow that there may be ca&s;es wherein it may be nece&s;&s;ary; and the acts you complain of expre&s;sly re&s;trict the exerci&s;e of it to &s;uch ca&s;es only. If you &s;ay, that you are out of the realm, there is a law for it as an|cient as the reign of King Henry VIII; and if you &s;ay, that you are not out of the realm, you mu&s;t allow the validity (at lea&s;t) of the late acts; &s;o that, be you within or without the the realm, it is not again&s;t law: And where people are in a violent heat with party prejudices, every one will grant that a fair trial cannot be expected; therefore, in &s;uch ca&s;es, it is not again&s;t rea&s;on. That this is now the ca&s;e in particular parts of America, I can a&s;&s;ert of my own certain knowledge, and therefore I &s;hall not condemn the act; but if it &s;hould be made u&s;e of, where there is no danger of a fair trial, then, and not till then, will I condemn the exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;h Jury will never be actuated by the face of a neighbour, or the appearance of a &s;tranger, neither will they be moved by party prejudice, nor national re&s;entment, nor will the wealth or the poverty of the offender, contribute in the lea&s;t to his acquittal or condemnation at their tribunal.</P>
<P>I am &s;urprized, exceedingly &s;urprized indeed, that you &s;hould offer to palm upon us for truth, &s;o notorious an ab&s;ur|dity, as that your refu&s;al and de&s;truction of the tea, was to prevent a pre&s;ident of taxation. The Po&s;t-Office, the duties on Wine, Sugar, Mola&s;&s;es, &amp;c. were &s;urely pre&s;idents of the &s;elf &s;ame nature. The&s;e you continued to pay; and this &s;ame duty on tea too, you had heretofore paid. How fal&s;e! how ridiculous then, are your preten&s;ions! The true rea&s;on (I have been a&s;&s;ured by a reformed &s;muggler, who now reflects on it with horror) was this, the &s;mugglers knowing that the India-Company's tea, would have &s;upplied the country, &s;o much
<PB N="19" REF="014159_0018_0F9333CC0AEF6C58">
better and cheaper than they were heretofore &s;upplied; and knowing of con&s;equence, that their exorbitant profits (produced by perjury and fal&s;e &s;wearing) mu&s;t inevitably fall, unle&s;s they could blind and deceive the people; they therefore endea|voured to mi&s;lead and inflame the minds of the populace again&s;t the tea, and &s;ucceeded in their ba&s;e de&s;ign.</P>
<P>I cannot but drop the tear of pity for &s;uch as are innocently &s;uffering in the town of Bo&s;ton, and I hope they will have compa&s;&s;ion &s;hown them. But as his Maje&s;ty's ports, are like his highways, free for all his &s;ubjects; when that freedom is with impunity de&s;troyed, it (in my opinion) becomes the in|di&s;pen&s;ible duty of the legi&s;lature to pronounce, that till it can be free for all, it &s;hall not be free for any. The main out cry now is, that they were condemned unheard, but it is granted by mo&s;t people, that the po&s;itive information and com|plaint of the de&s;truction of the tea, and of the inhuman treat|ment of the Per&s;on of the King's officer, was &s;ufficient to &s;hut the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e (and con&s;equently the port) till the town &s;hould be heard in their defence. If therefore, the act had ordered, that the port &s;hould have been opened again, when their innocence &s;hould have appeared on fair trial; or as &s;oon as they had made &s;atisfaction, provided they &s;hould be found guilty, then this objection would have been obviated; and let me humbly a&s;k the people of Bo&s;ton, who be&s;t know the circum&s;tances, what benefit would have accrued to them from that clau&s;e, more than as the act now &s;tands. However, I wi&s;h the former part had been in&s;erted in the act, if that would have made them ea&s;ier. But though it was not, I &s;hall not conclude that ju&s;tice and humanity are fled, nor can I per&s;uade my&s;elf that the&s;e proceedings were &s;o irreconcileable to the genius and temper of our laws and con&s;titution, as the proceedings of the Congre&s;s were, to the title by which they call them&s;elves his Maje&s;ty's dutiful and loyal &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>When the populace in any country &s;o far mi&s;interpret and mi&s;|u&s;e their form of government, as to collect and a&s;&s;emble to|gether, the Taylors, and the Coblers, and the Ploughmen, and the Shepherds, and there treat and re&s;olve, about matters of the highe&s;t importance of &s;tate,&mdash;matter which can never be acquired but with the greate&s;t &s;tudy and expence, and which they, from the very nature of things mu&s;t be ignorant of, as of the languages of the Ea&s;t; when the&s;e things, I &s;ay, are carried &s;o far as, to break out in open defiance to both law and ju&s;tice, &s;o that neither per&s;on nor property can be protected from the hands of violence, nor the offenders brought to puni&s;hment;

which if permitted to rage long mu&s;t inevitably breed a gene|ral di&s;order in the &s;tate, if not in time overturn the whole em|pire; it is &s;urely high time that the form of government &s;hould be changed, to &s;uch an one as cannot be &s;o de&s;tructively mi&s;interpreted, and abu&s;ed. This (I am very &s;ure) has for a con&s;iderable time been the ca&s;e in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, not|with&s;tanding you would endeavour to deceive my brethren in the parent country, by &s;aying it was only becau&s;e a tre&s;pa&s;s had been committed on &s;ome merchandize in one of their towns.</P>
<P>Your wicked governors, &amp; I cannot &s;ay much about; I might have given you &s;ome credit as to this, &s;eeing I am not acquainted with it, had I not found other ungenerous and fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions; but to be hone&s;t with you, as the ca&s;e &s;tands, I doubt much whether this may not be like &s;ome of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>You &s;trangely betray your geographical under&s;tandings if you conceive the dominions of Canada, to be extended beyond its ancient limits! The pre&s;ent province of Quebec is far, far &s;maller than what that government always claimed by the name of Canada. Neither is the laws which you &s;peak of, near &s;o unfavourable for the &s;ubject, as the laws of every of your colonies were in their infancy. Pray turn your eyes to the Floridas and &s;ee what tho&s;e new colonies now are. Look into the Virginia charter, which comprehended all the coun|try between Carolina and Nova-Scotia, (under which charter New England fir&s;t &s;ettled,) and you will find that the officers of that government, were appointed by a council of proprie|tors re&s;iding in England, and had by the charter,
<Q>full and ab&s;olute power and authority, to correct, puni&s;h, and par|don, govern and rule, &amp;c. according to &s;uch orders, ordi|nances, con&s;titutions, directions, and in&s;tructions, as by our &s;aid council as afore&s;aid, &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed; and in defect thereof, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, according to the good di&s;cre|tion of the &s;aid governor, and officers re&s;pectively, as well in ca&s;es capital as civil, both maritime and others.</Q>
This, my fellow &s;ubjects, was your con&s;titution once, but happily (&s;ince your circum&s;tances are altered) this as well as the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts charter is aboli&s;hed. Is not the pre&s;ent government of Quebec ten thou&s;and times more &s;ecure for the &s;ubject than this was? nor is there any rea&s;on to doubt, but as &s;oon as a con&s;titution can be more properly adapted to the nature and circum&s;tances of tho&s;e people, than the pre&s;ent is, the mode of government in the province of Quebec will be altered al&s;o.</P>

<Q>both in the de&s;cription and quality of the offence, and in the method of pro&s;ecution and trial.</Q>
Have they not the benefit of their Habeas Corpus then in criminal ca&s;es? And what rea&s;on have we to &s;uppo&s;e that they have not their Habeas Corpus in civil ca&s;es? Many of you enjoy it only by virtue of his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions to his Governors, and may not Governor Carlton have tho&s;e in&s;tructions as well as the other Governors?</P>
<P>I am a&s;toni&s;hed that you &s;hould conceive that any other than the church of England, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the fir&s;t year of Queen Elizabeth, was the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of any part of the empire!&mdash;How is the church of Rome e&s;tabli&s;hed in Quebec? Let us read the clau&s;e in the act&mdash;
<Q>And for the more perfect &s;ecurity and ea&s;e of the minds of the inhabi|tants of the &s;aid province, it is hereby declared, that his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects profe&s;&s;ing the religion of the church of Rome, of and in the &s;aid province of Quebec, may have, hold and enjoy, the free exerci&s;e of the religion of the church of Rome, &s;ubject to the King's &s;upremacy de|clared and e&s;tabli&s;hed by an act made in the fir&s;t year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, over all the dominions and countries, which then did, or hereafter &s;hould belong to the imperial crown of this realm.</Q>
&mdash;Does this e&s;tabli&s;h the church of Rome? Nay, does it not declare, that the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of the whole empire is that of which the King is &s;upreme head, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the fir&s;t year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth; but let us read on,
<Q>and that the clergy of the &s;aid church may hold, receive and enjoy, their accu&s;tomed dues and rights, with re&s;pect to &s;uch per|&s;ons ONLY, as &s;hall profe&s;s the &s;aid religion.</Q>
&mdash;Is it this part of the clau&s;e that e&s;tabli&s;hes the church of Rome? This &s;urely not only leaves every individual who now profe&s;&s;es that religion, at his liberty to turn Prote&s;tant, but declares, that that moment the church of Rome &s;hall lo&s;e that part of her revenue.&mdash;So that this gives the individuals of the laity them|&s;elves, full power and authority either to continue in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of that religion, or totally to extingui&s;h both it and its revenues, ju&s;t as they &s;hall think proper.&mdash;How, and on

what foundation then, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, is the church of Rome e&s;tabli&s;hed?&mdash;This kind of ESTABLISHING is &s;o much like being a part of the empire, lying out of the juri&s;diction of the imperial legi&s;lature, that common &s;en&s;e it&s;elf is affronted at the expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Will you &s;ay this act made provi&s;ion for the clergy of that church? I deny it.&mdash; The provi&s;ion was made long before.&mdash;But you will perhaps &s;ay, this act does not take it away from them; no,&mdash;it takes it away from them no fa&s;ter, than the laity renounce that church,&mdash;but it does ju&s;t &s;o fa&s;t tho'; and that too, to enable his Maje&s;ty to provide another church for them, as the act expre&s;&s;es it.&mdash;But previous to the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, every Prote&s;tant who held an e&s;tate, which was heretofore granted under France, was liable to the payment of the revenues to the church of Rome; nor could any thing le&s;s than an act of Parliament exempt them from it.&mdash;Yet you &s;ay, by this act the church of Rome is e&s;tabli&s;hed! O &s;hame! Shame to your under&s;tandings! rather (I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e) &s;hame for your en|deavours to mi&s;lead the ignorant!&mdash;Had the&s;e revenues been taken away &s;ooner, what &s;hould have been done with it in the opinions of the&s;e good Chri&s;tians?

They would immediately &s;ay it was arbitrary, unju&s;t, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. many hard names they would give it.&mdash;It is a bad rule that will not work both ways,&mdash;&s;urely then the Canadians might have &s;aid &s;o had it been their ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I am &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed at what you tell us of the fruits of their religion.&mdash;Religion of all kinds ought to bring forth good fruit.&mdash;Far be it from me to be &s;o uncharitable as to di&s;like any per&s;on or body of people on account of their re|ligious &s;entiments, if they will not impo&s;e their opinions on others.&mdash;My opinion in religious matters is this,&mdash;That &s;ee|ing all men are an&s;werable to their God, and to their God only, for their religious opinions; &s;o all men ought to enjoy them, and to have the liberty of wor&s;hipping their God in what manner they them&s;elves &s;hall think be&s;t; provided they mole&s;t no other per&s;on or body of people, who&s;e opinions are different from theirs.&mdash;But, if the actions of the different &s;ects in religion are enquired into, we &s;hall find, by turning over

the &s;ad hi&s;toric page, that it was the &mdash; &s;ect (I forget what they call them, I mean the &s;ect which is &s;till mo&s;t nume|rous in New-England, and not the &s;ect which they &s;o much de&s;pi&s;e) that in the la&s;t century deluged our i&s;land in blood! That even &s;hed the blood of the &s;overeign, and di&s;per&s;ed im|piety, bigotry, &s;uper&s;tition, hypocri&s;y, per&s;ecution, murder and rebellion through every part of the empire!&mdash;Neither would that &s;ect, during a &s;eries of years, in which they held the power they had u&s;urped, &s;o much as &s;uffer the members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England, to call upon their God in their u&s;ual manner!&mdash;Yet notwith&s;tanding this treatment, the e&s;tabli&s;hed church when (after the re&s;toration) it rea&s;&s;umed its former power, and &s;hone forth again in its former lu&s;tre, it gave this very &s;ect immediate toleration!</P>
<P>Moreover, we find, thet even long after the re&s;toration, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts not only per&s;ecuted the indu&s;trious &s;ons of qui|etne&s;s and peace called Quakers, unto death; but neither would they &s;uffer any per&s;on to celebrate a day in commemo|ration of the birth of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer; but by an act of A&s;&s;embly of that province, any per&s;on who &s;hould pre&s;ume to keep Chri&s;tmas-day, was fined in an exce&s;&s;ive &s;um! And in &s;ome parts of New-England, even to this day, the members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England, who re&s;ide among them (even if there be no church of England within an hun|dred miles) are not allowed the benefits of the &s;acraments, either of bapti&s;m, or the &s;upper of the Lord, altho' they are largely fined if they omit con&s;tant attendance on their &s;er|mons!&mdash;They are al&s;o to this day, both in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut (whether re&s;idents or &s;trangers) prohibited (under a pretence of purity and piety) from walking or riding out, to view the &s;acred and adorable works of the great Creator on Sunday! Though that mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly contains as much real religion as the hearing of the &s;acred word: And an im|pertinent tything man or con&s;table, is empowered to interro|gate, and (in Connecticut e&s;pecially) either with or without a precept, to &s;eize and impri&s;on any Gentleman who does not yield immediate obedience to his tyrannical commands! Is this, my fellow &s;ubjects, I &s;ay, is this liberty and religion? Surely not.&mdash;It is vile tyranny and &s;uper&s;tition, bigotry, un|charitablene&s;s, per&s;ecution, and hypocri&s;y; (let us remember what is &s;aid by the Prophet I&s;aiah, in a &s;imilar circum&s;tance) &mdash;<HI>It is an abomination unto me, &s;aith the Lord, I cannot away with it.</HI></P>

<P>But let not the hi&s;tory of the actions of this &s;ect, create too exten&s;ive a prejudice in the minds of my readers, again&s;t the people or religion of New-England.&mdash;Let no man be di&s;|re&s;pected for the country in which he lives, or from whence he came; nor for the religion which he profe&s;&s;eth;&mdash;men may be a di&s;grace to their country, or to their religion; but coun|try or religion, can, in my opinion, di&s;grace no man.&mdash;If the per&s;on him&s;elf be an upright man, that is &s;ufficient, whe|ther his country or religion be the &s;ame as mine, or whether it be not. And I have found many individuals in New-Eng|land, both of the clergy and laity, profe&s;&s;ing this religion, who are as good men as any on the earth;&mdash;are free from bi|gotry and uncharitablene&s;s,&mdash;allow members of the church of England to partake with them in their &s;acraments, and as highly de&s;pi&s;e the actions which I have mentioned, as any people in the world.&mdash;Neither is there any that wi&s;h more heartily than &s;ome of them do, to &s;ee &s;uch hypocri&s;y, &s;uper|&s;tition, bigotry and uncharitablene&s;s, totally rooted out from among them.&mdash;Let therefore, the rigid alone take the effects of their bigotry to them&s;elves, and let the free and charita|ble of them, be treated with that re&s;pect and e&s;teem which upright men of every &s;ect are worthy of.</P>
<P>Behold! my fellow-&s;ubjects! while you are telling us, that your liberties are endangered by the religion of the Canadi|ans, you in your addre&s;s to them &s;ay quite the contrary, and bring &s;wift arguments to prove it!&mdash;O ye di&s;&s;emblers! Both Britain and Quebec mu&s;t be blind indeed, if they do not &s;ee your double dealing at the very fir&s;t glance! Surely, that vir|tue, ju&s;tice and public &s;pirit of the nation, to which you appeal, will treat &s;uch deceitful chicane with the contempt it de&s;erves. But I hope the guilty alone will receive it; I am a little acquainted with &s;ome of the New-York Delegates, and am pretty well per&s;uaded that it &s;prung not from them.</P>
<P>Our union we e&s;teem as well as you, neither do we want that you &s;hould be le&s;s free than our&s;elves; we want not that you &s;hould be either hewers of wood, or drawers of water; we want only that you &s;hould behave like fellow &s;ubjects; but &s;eeing your riches are encrea&s;ing, and that you can already afford a little, you may not expect that we &s;hall bear all the burthen of protecting you, that we did previous to the late war.</P>
