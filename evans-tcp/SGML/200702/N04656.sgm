<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM XXVI. 8.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>LORD, I have loved the Habitation of thy Hou&s;e, and the Place where thine Honour dwelleth.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING by <HI>the good Hand of our GOD towards us,</HI> with &s;o much happy Unanimity and Di&s;|patch, built this Hou&s;e to the Honour of his Name; and it being henceforward to be dedi|cated to his more immediate Wor&s;hip and Service, I pro|po&s;e, on this Occa&s;ion, from the Example of the holy P&s;al|mi&s;t before us, to engage your Love to it and Delight in it, that you may always be able to &s;ay as he does in my Text, <HI>LORD, I have loved the Habitation of thy Hou&s;e, and the Place where thine Honour dwelleth.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>David</HI> in this P&s;alm pleads for an Intere&s;t in God's Favour and Protection, in Con&s;ideration of his Sincerity and Integrity in the general Cour&s;e of his Behaviour before him. <HI>Thy Lovingkindne&s;s,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is before mine Eyes and I have walked in thy Truth,</HI> v. 3. He declares his Abhorrence of evil Practices and evil Company, and his Re&s;olution to main|tain

Innocence and Purity, in Order to render his Ap|proaches to GOD in divine Service acceptable to him, ver. 6. <HI>I will wa&s;h my Hands in Innocency, &s;o will I compa&s;s thine Altar, O LORD.</HI> On this Occa&s;ion he profe&s;&s;es and declares in my Text, his great Love to the Hou&s;e and pub|lick Wor&s;hip of GOD; <HI>LORD,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I have loved the Habitation of thy Hou&s;e, and the Place where thine Honour dwelleth.</HI></P>
<P>By the Hou&s;e of GOD, we are to under&s;tand the Place &s;et apart from worldly U&s;es for the Wor&s;hip and Service of GOD: and he calls it <HI>the Place where his Honour dwelleth,</HI> becau&s;e it is the Place where he vouch&s;afes his peculiar Pre&s;ence, and where we meet together to do Honour to him; to wor&s;hip and adore him.&mdash;And when he tells us, how much he loved the Hou&s;e of GOD, his Meaning is, not that he loved it for its own Sake, but for GOD's Sake, and upon Account of the Wor&s;hip and Service that is open|ly performed to the Honour of GOD in it; or, which is the &s;ame Thing, that he loved and delighted in the public Wor&s;hip of GOD.&mdash;What I propo&s;e therefore, is, as I &s;aid, to explain and inforce the <HI>Great Duty of Loving and Delight|ing in the public Wor&s;hip of GOD.</HI> In doing which,</P>
<P>I. I &s;hall give a general Account of the Nature of Wor|&s;hip, and particularly of the public Wor&s;hip of GOD.</P>
<P>II. I &s;hall con&s;ider what is implied in our Love to the public Wor&s;hip, the genuine Tokens and Effects of it.</P>
<P>III. I &s;hall &s;et before you the Rea&s;ons and Motives on the Account of which we ought to love and delight in it.</P>
<P>I. I am to give you a general Account of the Nature of Wor&s;hip, and particularly, of the publick Wor&s;hip of GOD. And in order to this, Wor&s;hip mu&s;t be con|&s;idered both as it is an Act of the <HI>Mind,</HI> and as it is an Act of the <HI>whole Man.</HI>&mdash;As it is an Act of the Mind, it implies, a deep and habitual Sen&s;e of GOD, and of all his adorable Attributes and Perfections, and of our Re|lation
<PB N="7" REF="005795_0005_1026F030B0A59148">
to him, and Dependance upon him, and that we do accordingly from our Hearts give him the Glory of all that we are and enjoy: And con&s;equently, it mu&s;t imply a deep Sen&s;e of our Need of his In&s;truction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and of his Favour and Ble&s;&s;ing both for Soul and Body, and our earne&s;t Application to him therefor, with a hearty and un|Dedication of our &s;elves and all our Powers and Faculties to his true and faithful Service.&mdash;This is Wor&s;hip as it con&s;i&s;ts in the Exerci&s;e of the Mind.&mdash;But, as GOD has given us the Organs and Faculties of the Body where|with to expre&s;s and te&s;tify the inward Sen&s;e and Exertions of the Mind, it is fit in it &s;elf, and therefore he requires, that our whole Man be employed in his Wor&s;hip and Ser|vice;&mdash;that we <HI>glorify him</HI> with our <HI>Mouths</HI> as well as <HI>our Minds;</HI> with <HI>our Bodies</HI> as well as <HI>our Spirits,</HI> which are both equally <HI>his,</HI> being both alike created and redeemed by him.&mdash;It is therefore our Duty to te&s;tify the inward Sen&s;e and Devotion of our Souls by the outward Language and De|portment of our Bodies; by &s;uch a Language, &s;uch Ge&s;tures and Deportment of the Body as are mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t Humility, Reverence and Devotion of our Souls.&mdash;For, &s;ince we are &s;en&s;itive as well as rational Creatures, and are apt to be wro't upon by &s;en&s;ible Objects, it is fit that we make U&s;e of &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Means wherewith the better to exert and affect our Minds.&mdash;But we mu&s;t always remem|ber that as our Minds do properly con&s;titute our rational Character as being what we really are, &s;o our Hearts mu&s;t ever corre&s;pond with the&s;e outward Profe&s;&s;ions and Acti|ons, otherwi&s;e we may more truly be &s;aid to mock God than adore him, and our Performances can be of no Account at all with him: for the <HI>Sacrifice of the Wicked is an Abomina|tion to the LORD,</HI> but it is <HI>the Prayer of the Upright</HI> that is <HI>his Delight.</HI> Prov. 15. 9.</P>
<P>It is moreover nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider Wor&s;hip both as it is a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> and as it is a <HI>&s;ocial</HI> Act.&mdash;Every <HI>particular Per|&s;on</HI> has particular Sins of his own to confe&s;s and repent of, and both needs and receives many particular Ble&s;&s;ings and Favours peculiar to him&s;elf, for which he ought in all Rea|&s;on daily to pray to GOD, and to give him the Glory of them: And it is nece&s;&s;ary in the Nature of the Thing that

Religion be every Man's own per&s;onal Act and Deed even in &s;ocial Wor&s;hip; for the&s;e Rea&s;ons our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour enjoins it upon all his Di&s;ciples as an indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty, That each Per&s;on by him&s;elf, <HI>enter into his Clo&s;et, and &s;hut too the Door, and pray to his Father in &s;ecret, that his Father who &s;eeth in &s;ecret, may reward him openly.</HI> Mat. 6. 4.</P>
<P>But, as we are made for Society, and are a &s;ocial Sy&s;tem of Creatures &s;en&s;ible to each other, and are mo&s;t apt to be engaged <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and affected with what we do in Society and Fellow&s;hip one with another:&mdash;As we have all the &s;ame common Enjoyments and common Nece&s;&s;ities both tem|poral and &s;piritual; and what we do in common enjoy, does in all Rea&s;on demand a common Tribute of Prai&s;e, and what we all equally &s;tand in Need of, it is fit we &s;hould jointly and together make our Addre&s;&s;es to God for:&mdash;As this is our mo&s;t <HI>rea&s;onable Service</HI> in it &s;elf, and nothing is more beautiful, fit and amiable than that a Sy&s;tem of rea|&s;onable Creatures &s;hould join together with one Heart and Voice in doing the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Thing in the World, by which their Hearts would be the more effectually unit|ed and knit together in promoting all the Advantages of the &s;ocial Life;&mdash;on the&s;e and the like Accounts GOD does more e&s;pecially require and in&s;i&s;t upon &s;ocial Religion as our mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible and bounden Duty, both in Fa|milies and Common Wealths.</P>
<P><HI>Families</HI> may be called natural Societies as depending on the Cour&s;e of Nature, and founded in that natural Affection which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among Relatives;&mdash;and as the&s;e are the Foundation of all other Societies, and con&s;equently the good or ill State of other Communities which are made up of the&s;e, does chiefly depend upon the good or ill Habits that we contract in the&s;e original Seminaries of Society;&mdash;And as the public Weal of any Communities does in a great Mea&s;ure depend upon a deep Sen&s;e of GOD and Religion; it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that this be acquired and cultivated in our Souls from our very Infancy by the con&s;tant and regular Exerci&s;e of Family-Religion.&mdash;Hence it is the Character GOD gives with &s;pecial Commendation of <HI>Abraham</HI> the <HI>Father of the Faithful,</HI> that he would <HI>com|mand

his Hou&s;e and his Children after him to keep the Way of the Lord.</HI> Gen. 18. 10. And it was the pious Re&s;olution of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> Chap. 24. 15. <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI> And in <HI>Jer.</HI> 10. 25. God threatens to pour out his Fury <HI>upon the People that know not him, and upon the Families that call not upon his Name.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Civil Governments</HI> or <HI>Common Wealths</HI> are political Socie|ties founded in Compact to promote the general Good of the whole.&mdash;Now, as the general Good of every Commu|nity in the whole depends upon the uniform Practice of every Virtue, Temperance, Meekne&s;s, and Humility, Ju&s;|tice, Truth, Faithfulne&s;s and Integrity, Charity, Mercy, u|niver&s;al Benevolence, and Obedience to Authority, and where the contrary Vices reign, there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be an utter Di&s;&s;olution of all that is amiable and comfortable in Society: As it is nece&s;&s;ary, that the&s;e and the like Vir|tues be founded and rooted in the Heart in Order that they be habitually and &s;teadily exerted in the Life and Behaviour:&mdash;And as here is nothing can tend &s;o effectu|ally to operate upon the Hearts and inward Sentiments of the Souls of Men as a deep Sen&s;e of the all-&s;eeing and Heart-&s;earching Eye of a mo&s;t pure and holy, a mo&s;t kind, true and ju&s;t GOD, ever pre&s;ent with us and to whom we are accountable for all our Behaviour:&mdash;And la&s;tly, as this Sen&s;e of GOD is be&s;t cultivated by a con&s;tant and public Exerci&s;e of Religion in the devout Wor&s;hip and Adoration of this glorious Being on who&s;e Providence all human Af|fairs do ince&s;&s;antly depend; it is hence manife&s;t that who|ever would in the be&s;t Manner con&s;ult the general Good and public Weal of Mankind, whether in larger or &s;mall|er Communities and Combinations, mu&s;t maintain and pro|mote the public Exerci&s;e of Religion, and the devout Wor|&s;hip of Almighty GOD.</P>
<P>And accordingly, as this &s;eems to have been as it were engraven upon the Hearts of all Mankind of every Age and Nation, in&s;omuch that there never have been any Communities of Men who have not cultivated &s;ome Sort of public Religion and Wor&s;hip; &s;o it is remarkable in the Hi&s;tory of all Nations, even tho&s;e who have not had
<PB N="10" REF="005795_0008_1026F038B6A9CA28">
the true Wor&s;hip of GOD among them, and more e&s;peci|ally of his peculiar People, to whom he has pre&s;cribed the right Method of his public Wor&s;hip, (and whom he has appointed and &s;et up <HI>as a City upon an Hill</HI> to hold forth Light and to be Examples to the re&s;t of the World) that they have ever fared well or ill; have ever met with pro|&s;perous or adver&s;e Fortune, have ever been treated with Ble&s;&s;ings or Cur&s;es from Almighty GOD, according as they have been more or le&s;s religious and virtuous, and have been more or le&s;s zealous and regardful of his public Wor|&s;hip.&mdash;So that it is a Matter of the greate&s;t Importance, e&s;pecially to us Chri&s;tians, who are infallibly taught by Revelation from Heaven, the right Method of wor&s;hip|ing GOD, &s;o as to obtain his Favour and Acceptance through the Mediation of his dear Son, and by the A&s;&s;i&s;|tance of his Holy Spirit, that we rightly under&s;tand the Na|ture of the public Wor&s;hip, and the Obligations we are under to a con&s;tant and regular Attendance upon it.&mdash;Let us therefore be a little particular upon this great and im|portant Subject.</P>
<P>In public Wor&s;hip we meet together into one Place, &s;a|cred to Almighty GOD, as being devoted or &s;et apart to the &s;ole Purpo&s;e of doing open and public Honour to him who is the great Maker, Pre&s;erver and Governor of the World.&mdash;We there acknowledge our&s;elves to be his Crea|tures; to be made, pre&s;erved, maintained and redeemed by him, and give him the Glory of all that we have and are, of all our Enjoyments, and all our Hopes in Time and to all Eternity: We addre&s;s our &s;elves to him for all that we want both for Soul and Body, and receive his In&s;tructions and devote our &s;elves to be governed by them in Heart and Life.&mdash;So that public Wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e four Acts; in jointly prai&s;ing GOD, and praying to him, and in receiving his In&s;tructions, and devoting our &s;elves to his Service.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Article of public Wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>joint|ly prai&s;ing GOD.</HI> Now to prai&s;e GOD is to acknowledge him to be what he is, to recognize his glorious Attributes and Operations, and to acknowledge our &s;elves to be what
<PB N="11" REF="005795_0009_1026F03B124064D0">
we are, his Creatures and Dependants, and to give him the Glory of all that we derive from him.&mdash;So that in prai&s;ing GOD we devoutly confe&s;s and adore him as a Being of in|finite Perfection, eternal and unchangeable: We admire his all-comprehending Knowledge, his a&s;toni&s;hing Wi&s;|dom, his boundle&s;s Power, and his unlimited and never-failing Goodne&s;s, which are &s;urprizingly di&s;played in all his Works of Nature, Providence and Grace: We ac|knowledge him to be the Almighty Creator, the mo&s;t in|dulgent Pre&s;erver and &s;upreme Governor of all Things in Heaven and Earth, and declare our &s;incere&s;t Love and Gra|titude, and our profounde&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion and Reverence for the un&s;peakable Goodne&s;s, Kindne&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Truth and Faithfulne&s;s of all his wi&s;e and holy Admini&s;trations, in the Government of the World, and our utmo&s;t Abhor|rence and Dete&s;tation of every Thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the infinite Perfections of his Nature and the expre&s;s Declara|tions of his Will. We acknowledge that all that we are and enjoy, we have received from him, and hold intirely at his Mercy; that it is <HI>He that hath made us, and not we our &s;elves, we are his People and the Sheep of his Pa&s;ture.</HI> (P&s;al. 100. 3.) <HI>That he upholdeth our Souls in Life,</HI> and daily <HI>&s;atisfieth our Mouth with good Things, and reneweth our Youth as the Eagles: That he forgiveth all our Iniquities, and healeth all our Di&s;ea&s;es: He redeemeth our Life from De&s;truction, and crowneth us with his Lovingkindne&s;s and tender Mercies.</HI> (P&s;al. 103. 3, 4, 5.) And that it is he that <HI>giveth us Rain from Heaven and fruitful Sea&s;ons, filling our Hearts with Food and Gladne&s;s, and be&s;toweth upon us all Things richly to enjoy.</HI> (Acts 14. 17. and 1 Tim. 6. 17.) We do moreover mo&s;t gratefully acknowledge, that when we had by Rebellion and wicked Works apo&s;tatized from him, and ca&s;t our|&s;elves out of his Favour, he did, in tender Compa&s;&s;ion to our Souls, &s;end his only Son to redeem us, and his Holy Spirit to &s;anctify us, that we might be recovered again to his Service, and be rein&s;tated in his Favour and Friend&s;hip.&mdash;I &s;ay we acknowledge GOD to be the &s;ole Author of all the&s;e Favours and Ble&s;&s;ings, and a&s;cribe the Glory of all to him, &s;aying, <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, O LORD, but unto thy Name be the Glory, both for thy Truth, and for thy Mercy's Sake.</HI> P&s;al. 115. 1. In &s;uch Acknowledgments as
<PB N="12" REF="005795_0010_1026F03CDCC41708">
the&s;e it is, that we perform the great Duty of prai&s;ing GOD, which is the fir&s;t Act of Wor&s;hip: For which Pur|po&s;e the Church of GOD, and our excellent Church in particular, hath always made U&s;e of the P&s;alms of <HI>David,</HI> and other devout Hymns, chiefly taken out of the Scrip|tures, as being in the be&s;t Manner expre&s;&s;ive of the&s;e great Subjects of Adoration, Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>next</HI> is <HI>public Prayer.</HI> By which, having prai&s;ed GOD for all we enjoy, we make our Addre&s;&s;es to him for what&s;oever we want, both for our Souls and Bodies, for our|&s;elves and others. Our fir&s;t and chief Concern mu&s;t be for our Souls, that we may obtain tho&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings without which we mu&s;t be unavoidably mi&s;erable: And the&s;e are, The Pardon of our Sins, and the Favour and Acceptance of GOD, the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Guidance of his Holy Spirit here, and eternal Happine&s;s in the Life to come.&mdash;Sin is the mo&s;t pernicious of all Evils; it is the mo&s;t fatal Bane of our rational and immortal Natures; for while we continue under the Power and Guilt of it, it is, in the Nature of Things, utterly impo&s;&s;ible but that we mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. The fir&s;t Thing, therefore, that it concerns us to be &s;olicitous, and to pray for, is, that we may be delivered from the Power and Guilt of Sin. In Order to this, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we begin our Addre&s;&s;es to GOD, (as our Church does) with a mo&s;t &s;erious Act of Repentance, which is the &s;ole and indi&s;pen&s;ible Condi|tion of Pardon, and nece&s;&s;ary in Order to render all our &s;ub&s;equent Acts of Prayer and Prai&s;e acceptable to him. This implies, that we do &s;incerely confe&s;s our Sins unto GOD and bewail all our Rebellions again&s;t him, and this with the lowe&s;t Pro&s;tration of Soul and unfeigned Contri|tion of Heart, and full Purpo&s;e and Re&s;olutions of Amend|ment of Life, as being the Qualifications ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to render us fit to receive the Ble&s;&s;ings we ask for at his Hands.&mdash;We then implore his Pardon and Mercy, and intreat his gracious Acceptance of our Repentance, and an Intere&s;t in his Favour through the Mediation and interce&s;|&s;ion of his dear Son.&mdash;And as we do thus confe&s;s our Sins and beg his Pardon, &s;o we do earne&s;tly apply our &s;elves to him for the Grace of his Holy Spirit to enlighten our
<PB N="13" REF="005795_0011_1026F03FE2DAD230">
Souls, to renew our Hearts and to &s;trengthen our Weak|ne&s;s that we may be able to with&s;tand the Power of Sin and all Temptations to it, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the Exerci&s;e of all tho&s;e Graces and Virtues which are nece&s;&s;ary to perfect our Natures, to conform us to his Image and ren|der us plea&s;ing and acceptable in his Sight through the Merits and Mediation of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer: In a Word, to fix and determine the whole Bia&s;s and Temper of our Souls to a &s;incere Union with his Will, and to enable us to per&s;evere in his Service, in Spite of all the Temptati|ons of the Devil, the World, and the Fle&s;h, faithful to the End of our Days, that we may be qualified for, and at Length admitted to the Enjoyment of endle&s;s Felicity and Glory in the Life to come.&mdash;And be&s;ides the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Ble&s;&s;ings that we beg for our Souls, we al&s;o pray for what|&s;oever we need for the Support of our Bodies; for Deli|verance from what&s;oever may be afflictive to us, and the Be&s;towment of what he &s;ees needful and convenient for us; Peace, Health, Food and Raiment, &amp;c. but all with a humble Submi&s;&s;ion to his Will, who knows what is be&s;t for us, infinitely better than we do our &s;elves.&mdash;And la&s;t|ly, We not only te&s;tify our Humility and Piety in praying for our &s;elves, but al&s;o our Benevolence and Charity in in|terceeding for others; <HI>for Kings and all that are in Autho|rity</HI> both in Church and State, and for all that are in any kind of Affliction either of Body or Mind, and not only for our Friends, but even for our very Enemies.&mdash;The&s;e are the &s;everal Acts of Prayer, which is the &s;econd Part of our public Wor&s;hip; for which Purpo&s;e our Church is happily provided with an excellent Liturgy judiciou&s;ly collected out of the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>third</HI> is, <HI>Receiving GOD's In&s;tructions.</HI> For which Purpo&s;e he hath given us the Holy Scriptures, wherein he hath explained his Mind and Will to us, and taught us what he would have us believe, and how he would have us behave and conduct our &s;elves in Or|der to our being truly happy. With Regard to each of which (be&s;ides the great Principles and Laws of Nature which are therein clearly explained and inculcated) he hath made known to us &s;undry Things of the greate&s;t Im|portance,
<PB N="14" REF="005795_0012_1026F04241E50BE0">

The public Wor&s;hip of GOD im|plies in it our <HI>devoting our &s;elves to his Service,</HI> by whom, and for whom we were made and redeemed.&mdash;And tho' this be the Language and Intent of every Act of Wor&s;hip, yet CHRIST hath appointed one holy Ordinance in parti|cular for this Purpo&s;e, I mean the holy Sacrament of the LORD's Supper: Whereby (having &s;olemnly entered into Covenant with GOD by Bapti&s;m, wherein we have de|voted our &s;elves, or been devoted, by our Friends to his Service) we do from Time to Time, refre&s;h upon our Minds a lively Sen&s;e of the dying Love of our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour, and in Con&s;ideration thereof do renew our Engage|ments and Re&s;olutions to live unto him who died for us and aro&s;e again. And as GOD does therein, on his Part, make over to us all tho&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings of the New Covenant which CHRIST hath purcha&s;ed for us by his Blood, &s;o we, on our Part, as a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of our being intere&s;ted in them, do &s;eriou&s;ly make over, or give up and devote our &s;elves to his true and faithful Service in the Performance of all the Duties he requires of us, in Order to our everla&s;ting Happine&s;s. And as we thus con&s;ider this Ordinance as a &s;olemn Act of Devotion, we there|fore receive it in a Po&s;ture of Adoration.&mdash;The&s;e are the &s;everal Parts of public Wor&s;hip, which, as we are Men,
<PB N="15" REF="005795_0013_1026F044979C9610">
but e&s;pecially as we are Chri&s;tians, we are bound to love and delight in with all our Hearts:&mdash;And I am in the</P>
<P>II. <HI>Second</HI> Place, to &s;hew you what is implied in our Love to it.&mdash;And as to this, we know, Love is that Pa&s;|&s;ion of the Soul whereby we delight in any Thing, and take Plea&s;ure in all Opportunities for the Enjoyment of it; and con&s;equently feel our &s;elves very unea&s;y if we are deprived of it.&mdash;Now therefore to apply this general Notion of Love to the Subject we are upon:&mdash;Our Love to the public Wor&s;hip mu&s;t imply the&s;e Things in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we love the public Wor&s;hip of GOD, we &s;hall be &s;o far from thinking it a Burthen, that it will be the great|e&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s to us to be deprived of the Opportunities of attending upon it. We &s;hall not be of the Humour of tho&s;e in the Prophet <HI>Malachi,</HI> Ch. 1. Ver. 3. Who &s;ay, <HI>What Profit is there in &s;erving the LORD, and behold what a Wearine&s;s is it? And when will the Sabbath be ended, that we may buy and &s;ell and get Gain?</HI>&mdash;This is the Language rather of an Athei&s;t than a Chri&s;tian, and favours of a Soul alienated from GOD, immer&s;ed in Fle&s;h and Sen&s;e, and de&s;titute of the &s;piritual and truly rational and divine Life.&mdash;Can there be the lea&s;t Spark of the Love of GOD in our Hearts if we have no Ta&s;te; no Reli&s;h for his Wor|&s;hip, and take no Delight in his Service, and find it a Bur|then to wait upon him and pay our Duty to him?&mdash;On the other Hand, if we have any Love for the Hou&s;e of GOD, when we are deprived of it, we &s;hall think our|&s;elves in the like melancholly Situation with <HI>David</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s, and be apt to &s;ay with him. P&s;al. 42. and 43. <HI>As the Hart panteth after the Water-Brooks, &s;o panteth my Soul after thee, O GOD; my Soul thir&s;teth for GOD even for the living GOD; O when &s;hall I come and appear before GOD?

2. If we love the public Wor&s;hip we &s;hall delight in the Returns of the Times and Sea&s;ons of it, and be far from &s;uffering any &s;light Temptation to prevail upon us to neg|lect it. This was the Temper of the holy Per&s;on who&s;e Example we are now recommending, P&s;al. 122. 1. <HI>I was glad,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>when they &s;aid, Come let us go into the Hou&s;e of the LORD, our Feet &s;hall &s;tand within thy Gates, O</HI> Jeru&s;a|lem, whither <HI>the Tribes go up, the Tribes of the LORD unto the Te&s;timony of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>to give Thanks unto the Name of the LORD.</HI>&mdash;He &s;eems to be in a Rapture at the Thoughts of that heavenly Exerci&s;e wherein he &s;o much delighted, nay, &s;eems as if he could be glad to be always in the Way of it, P&s;al. 27. 4. <HI>One Thing have I de&s;ired,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and that will I &s;eek after, that I may dwell in the Hou&s;e of the LORD all the Days of my Life, to behold the fair Beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his Temple.</HI>&mdash;Now how contrary to this is the Temper of the Generality of us now a-days; how dull and lazy, how cold and indifferent with Regard to the public Wor&s;hip? And how little and trifling a Matter will be &s;ufficient to excu&s;e many of us from attend|ing upon it? A little Degree of bad Weather, or per|haps only &s;ome probable Symptoms of it: A &s;light Indi&s;|po&s;ition or perhaps only an idle dull Humour will be a &s;ufficient Temptation to us to neglect it.&mdash;How ought we to be a&s;hamed of &s;uch a Spirit of Indifference to that which is our mo&s;t <HI>rea&s;onable Service,</HI> and to be re&s;olutely engaged in the Reformation of it? For in vain do we pretend to any true Love to GOD or &s;erious Care for our Souls everla&s;ting Weal, if a &s;mall Excu&s;e will keep us a|way from the public Wor&s;hip, which is the chief Te&s;ti|mony we can give of our Love to him, and as nece&s;&s;ary to the Nouri&s;hment and Support of the &s;piritual Life of our Souls, as our daily Bread is to the animal Life of our Bo|dies.&mdash;As therefore, an utter Lo&s;s of Appetite is a fatal Symptom with Regard to the Health and Life of the Body; &s;o, not to <HI>hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and the Means nece&s;&s;ary for it, is a no le&s;s fatal Symptom with Regard to the Life and Health of the Soul.&mdash;So that a good Man who loves the public Wor&s;hip (as we ought all to do) <HI>like his nece&s;&s;ary Food,</HI> will &s;tudiou&s;ly take Care to prevent every Thing that may hinder his Attendance,
<PB N="17" REF="005795_0015_1026F049CA245040">
and will not only order his Affairs &s;o as to attend con|&s;tantly him&s;elf, but will take his Family; his Children and Servants; all that po&s;&s;ibly he can with him to the Hou&s;e of GOD; it being, as I &s;aid, his &s;tedfa&s;t Re&s;oluti|on with good <HI>Jo&s;hua, As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the LORD.</HI> In a Word, I would advi&s;e every one when he finds him&s;elf tempted by any Excu&s;e to neglect the pub|lic Wor&s;hip of GOD, as well as any other Duty, &s;eriou&s;ly to lay his Hand upon his Heart, and a&s;k him&s;elf this Que&s;tion, Whether he can in earne&s;t think that Excu&s;e, whatever it be, will be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify him in the great Day of Accounts? and let him conduct according to the Views the he may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e he will then have of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Here began the Afternoon Sermon.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. A Man that truly loves the public Wor&s;hip, will make the be&s;t Advantage he can of it for the Purpo&s;es for which it is appointed.&mdash;As he will come in good Sea|&s;on, with a Heart duly prepared for a &s;erious Attendance, that he may be pre&s;ent at the preparatory Office of con|fe&s;&s;ing and repenting of his Sins, and receiving GOD's Declaration of Pardon to all true Penitents; &s;o he will take Care, as far as may be, to loo&s;e nothing of it, will attend diligently to every Part of it, endeavouring to <HI>keep his Heart with all Diligence</HI> (Prov. 4. 23.) and be duly intent and engaged in the Exerci&s;e of all the Acts of Wor&s;hip, making each of them his own Act and Deed; remembring the wi&s;e Man's Advice, <HI>Eccle&s;. 5. 1. Keep thy Foot when thou goe&s;t to the Hou&s;e of GOD, and be more ready to hear than to offer the Sacrifice of Fools.</HI>&mdash;He will endeavour to cha&s;tize and call back every wandering Thought, and to bani&s;h every vain and worldly Imagina|tion: He will rou&s;e him&s;elf up and keep his Sen&s;es and Under&s;tanding awake, and with the utmo&s;t Struggle en|deavour to cha&s;e away all Dulne&s;s and Li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s:&mdash;He will &s;trive to have devout and rai&s;ed Affections at the Con&s;ideration of the great, &s;ublime and noble Objects a|bout which his Mind is employed, and to exert all the Powers of his Soul in the heavenly Exerci&s;e in which he
<PB N="18" REF="005795_0016_1026F04C1F780BA8">
is engaged.&mdash;His Heart will a&s;cend up to GOD with earne&s;t De&s;ires at the offering up of every Petition, and be in&s;pired with ardent Devotion at every Act of Prai&s;e. It will be affected with the &s;incere&s;t Grief, attended with truly pious Re&s;olutions on Occa&s;ion of the Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin, and renewing of Repentance, and with lively Senti|ments of Gratitude upon the Recollection of the &s;everal In&s;tances of the divine Goodne&s;s:&mdash;It will &s;uffer a &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion from the In&s;tructions, Admonitions and Exhor|tations that are &s;ugge&s;ted, and from a deep Sen&s;e of the dying Love of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, be unfeignedly devoted for his Sake, to the faithful Service of Almighty GOD. In a Word, he will endeavour to conduct him&s;elf through all the Acts of public Wor&s;hip, as in the Pre&s;ence and at the Service of that great and all-&s;eeing GOD who ob|&s;erves every Motion of his Heart, and to whom he is ac|countable for all his Behaviour.&mdash;And as his Bu&s;ine&s;s there is to wor&s;hip GOD, he will not divert his Tho'ts to pay his Re&s;pects unto Men, but will employ them to the be&s;t Advantage he can in an&s;wering the Ends of his attending upon the public Wor&s;hip, which are the improv|ing and perfecting his rational and immortal Nature in all tho&s;e Qualifications and Accompli&s;hments that are e&s;peci|ally nece&s;&s;ary to its everla&s;ting Happine&s;s.&mdash;According|ly he applies him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t Diligence in the U&s;e of all the public Admini&s;trations of Religion, to rai&s;e his Soul to a truly divine and heavenly Temper, to increa&s;e in his Mind a deep and devout Sen&s;e of GOD, to mortify and &s;ubdue all vicious Habits and perver&s;e Tempers, and to improve him&s;elf in all Kinds of Virtue and Holine&s;s, that he may be qualified for and intitled to an everla&s;ting Intere&s;t in the Favour and Acceptance of Almighty GOD. The&s;e are the Ends he &s;incerely aims at: And for that Rea&s;on he will not, when Service is over, go into Com|pany and Diver&s;ion which will di&s;engage his Thoughts and Heart from what he has heard, and wipe out the good Impre&s;&s;ions he has received: But he retires home and keeps out of the World that he may cheri&s;h and im|prove them by private Reading, Meditation and Devotion, and take Care of his Family, his Children and Servants,
<PB N="19" REF="005795_0017_1026F04E892195E0">
that the Seeds of true Religion may be early &s;own in their Hearts.</P>
<P N="4">4. And <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> He that thus loves the public Wor&s;hip of GOD, will chearfully and liberally contribute, according to the utmo&s;t of his Ability to maintain and provide hon|ourably for it; whether it be for building or repairing Hou&s;es for the public Wor&s;hip, or for providing Uten&s;ils for it, or for &s;upporting the Mini&s;ters of Religion, &amp;c. as knowing that, &s;ince it is GOD that <HI>gives him all Things richly to enjoy,</HI> it is but his <HI>rea&s;onable Service</HI> and bounden Duty, that he &s;hould, in Te&s;timony of his Gratitude to his great Benefactor, and for &s;ecuring his Ble&s;&s;ing for the future upon all that he hath, be always ready to <HI>honour the LORD with his Sub&s;tance.</HI> (Prov. 3. 9.) And he that finds him&s;elf of a reluctant, narrow and contracted Spirit when any good Opportunity offers for doing Honour to GOD this <HI>Way,</HI> has but too much Rea&s;on to conclude that he <HI>loves the World</HI> and him&s;elf more than GOD, and con&s;equently that <HI>the Love of the Father is not in him.</HI> 1 Joh. 2. 15. And if this be the Ca&s;e, his Soul is in a very mi&s;erable Situation indeed.&mdash;The&s;e and the like, are the genuine Exerci&s;es and Fruits, and con&s;equently the true Evidences of this excellent Temper I am recommend|ing, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> A &s;incere Love to the public Wor&s;hip of GOD. Let us therefore, my Brethren, earne&s;tly endeavour to find them in us, and by no Means content our &s;elves without them: For if we are de&s;titute of them we are void of the true Temper and Spirit of Chri&s;tianity.

<P>III. In the <HI>third</HI> Place, &s;et before our &s;elves the Rea|&s;ons and Motives, on the Account of which, we ought to love and delight in the public Wor&s;hip. And to this Pur|po&s;e let it be con&s;idered, that it is a Duty mo&s;t rea&s;ona|ble,&mdash;mo&s;t amiable,&mdash;va&s;tly advantageous,&mdash;expre&s;ly commanded,&mdash;and was accordingly ever practi&s;ed by all good and holy Communities both of Men and Angels.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is mo&s;t rea&s;onable in it &s;elf that we do publickly and jointly wor&s;hip and adore Almighty GOD.&mdash;For
<PB N="20" REF="005795_0018_1026F050EE73CCC8">
this is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t important Principle of Rea&s;on, that we &s;hould think and act with Regard to every Be|ing; every Per&s;on and Thing, as being what it really is. Since therefore GOD the great Object of our Wor&s;hip, is that glorious Being who made, pre&s;erves and governs the World and every Creature therein, nothing can be more fit and rea&s;onable than that we do acknowledge and adore him as &s;uch. And &s;ince we derived our Being from him, and do, by the Nece&s;&s;ity of our Nature depend upon him every Moment, for the Continuance of it and all the Means nece&s;&s;ary for the Support of it; and do, on the&s;e Accounts, &s;tand in a mo&s;t near and unalterable Relation to him as his Creatures and Dependents; &s;ince we are made after his Image, being by him endowed with rational Powers and Faculties, whereby we are capable of under&s;tanding in what Relation we &s;tand towards him, of being &s;en&s;ible of our ab&s;olute Dependence upon him and innumerable Obli|gations to his infinite Goodne&s;s, and of being affected and conducting in &s;ome Mea&s;ure towards him accordingly;&mdash;and, &s;ince, when we had de&s;troyed our &s;elves by our Re|bellion again&s;t him, he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, of his meer Mercy, to &s;end his ble&s;&s;ed Son, and holy Spirit to recover us and bring us back to our Duty and his Favour; that be|ing delivered from the greate&s;t Mi&s;ery, we might be put into a Capacity for the Enjoyment of the greate&s;t Happi|ne&s;s:&mdash;I &s;ay, the Ca&s;e being really thus, nothing can be more fit and rea&s;onable than that we &s;hould, not only be deeply and mo&s;t gratefully &s;en&s;ible of all the&s;e Things, but likewi&s;e frequently expre&s;s this Sen&s;e of our Minds, by our grateful Acknowledgments for all that we have and are, and by &s;eriou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ing our &s;elves to him for what&s;oever we want, and by living and behaving our&s;elves as it becomes &s;uch a Condition and Apprehen&s;ion of Things: Otherwi&s;e we do not act like Men endowed with Rea&s;on and Con&s;ideration, but rather like irrational and unthinking Bea&s;ts.&mdash;And la&s;tly, Ina&s;much as we all in common partake of the&s;e Benefits and Advantages of Be|ing, Pre&s;ervation and the Enjoyment of our &s;elves and every Thing about us, and all equally <HI>live, move and have our Being in him,</HI> and not only all partake in common of the con&s;tant Fruits of his fatherly Care and his mo&s;t kind

and watchful Providence, but are all equally redeemed by the Blood of his dear Son, and con&s;equently all equally al|lied to him as our common Father, and to one another as Brethren: there is therefore all the Rea&s;on in the World that we &s;hould jointly and in common meet together to pay our Duty and Acknowledgments to him, and give him the Glory of the common Ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, and apply to him for the Supply of our common Wants and Nece&s;&s;ities. Thus you &s;ee that to attend con&s;tantly upon the public Wor&s;hip of Almighty GOD, and there to <HI>pre&s;ent our Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable to him, is our mo&s;t rea|&s;onable Service,</HI> (Rom. 12. 1.)

For it is what re|&s;ults as a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence from our Relation as Crea|tures and Dependents to him as our great Creator and Be|nefactor.

3. It is not only mo&s;t rea&s;onable and amiable, but it is moreover va&s;tly for our own Good and Advantage to wait upon GOD in the holy Services of his Wor&s;hip.&mdash;It cannot be denied, that what&s;oever tends to rai&s;e and per|fect our rational and immortal Nature and make it as hap|py as it is capable of being, not only in Time but to the endle&s;s Ages of Eternity, is of the highe&s;t Advantage to us. Now it is manife&s;t that the Knowledge, Love and Practice of what&s;oever is fit and rea&s;onable in it &s;elf can|not fail of perfecting our rea&s;onable Nature as &s;uch, and con&s;equently mu&s;t render it happy as long as it conti|nues what it is; and &s;ince it endures for ever it mu&s;t render it happy forever. Since therefore we have proved that Religion and the Wor&s;hip of GOD is the mo&s;t fit and rea&s;onable Thing in the World, it evidently follows, that this mu&s;t tend in the directe&s;t Manner to our highe&s;t Perfection and Happine&s;s.

Glories and Felicities of the heavenly State.&mdash;In Con|&s;equence of this, they cannot fail of feeling inexpre&s;&s;ible Calmne&s;s and Tranquillity of Mind, a <HI>Peace that pa&s;&s;eth all Under&s;tanding,</HI> and a <HI>Joy un&s;peakable, and full of Glory,</HI> while they have the comfortable Applau&s;es of a good Con|&s;cience and the glorious Hopes and Expectations of a ble&s;&s;ed Immortality.&mdash;This enables them to take the mo&s;t &s;olid Comfort in every Thing they enjoy in this World, and encourages them to confide in GOD's good Provi|dence for his Ble&s;&s;ing on all their Undertakings and En|joyments; for <HI>Godline&s;s hath the Promi&s;e of the Life that now is, as well as that which is to come.</HI> 2 Tim. 4. 8.&mdash;So many and great Advantages is the devout wor&s;hipping of GOD attended with!&mdash;How then can we fail of de|lighting in it, and pronouncing with the holy P&s;almi&s;t, Surely <HI>One Day &s;pent in the Hou&s;e of GOD is better than a Thou&s;and el&s;ewhere. I had rather be a Door-Keeper in the Hou&s;e of my GOD, than to dwell in the Tents of Wickedne&s;s: For the LORD GOD is a Sun and a Shield: He will give Grace and Glory, and no good Thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,</HI> P&s;al. 84.</P>

And when the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>Wor&s;hip the LORD in the Beauty of Holine&s;s,</HI> (P&s;al. 29. 2.) he means as I ob|&s;erved above, in that amiable Manner which is implied in the joint Addre&s;s of a great Number, unanimou&s;ly con|&s;piring together in devoting them&s;elves to the faithful Service of Almighty GOD.&mdash;Accordingly we find that the primitive Chri&s;tians, (Acts 4. 24.) who&s;e excellent Ex|ample we follow in our Church, <HI>Lift up their Voice with one Accord in the</HI> Wor&s;hip of GOD: And St. <HI>Paul</HI> requires that we &s;hould, <HI>with one Mind and one Mouth glorify GOD, even the Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST.</HI>&mdash;Not that GOD requires us to wor&s;hip him becau&s;e it is any

Advantage to him; for what Profit can <HI>it be to the Al|mighty that we &s;erve him?</HI> But it is meerly becau&s;e he knows it is for our own greate&s;t Good and Advantage, and that we do thereby pur&s;ue our highe&s;t Perfection and Happine&s;s.&mdash;We mu&s;t not therefore imagine that GOD requires us to wor&s;hip him for his own Sake, or that he &s;eeks to add any Thing to his Happine&s;s from it: That he does it becau&s;e he takes Plea&s;ure in hearing him&s;elf applauded by us, or aims at gratifying his arbitrary Will and Plea&s;ure by exacting our Obedience: No, the&s;e are Ends infinitely beneath him who has a boundle&s;s All-&s;uf|ficiency within him&s;elf for his own Happine&s;s, and there|fore cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand in Need of us or any of our Services: But he does it purely becau&s;e it is fit and right in it &s;elf, and upon many Accounts u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary for us to live under a con&s;tant and habitual Sen&s;e of our ab&s;olute Dependance upon him: And that nothing can &s;o effectually tend to keep up a lively Sen&s;e of this upon our Minds, which is the Foundation of all other Virtues, as to live in the daily Practice of attending upon his Wor|&s;hip: He does it becau&s;e he would have us happy, and he knows we cannot be happy without it. How much the greater Rea&s;on have we then to love and delight in his Service when we know that he requires it of us &s;o di&s;|intere&s;tedly, and from &s;o much Kindne&s;s and Good-Will towards us? But let us al&s;o remember that we mu&s;t ex|pect to be &s;o much the more &s;everely puni&s;hed for our Ingratitude and Perver&s;ene&s;s if we live in the Neglect of it.</P>
