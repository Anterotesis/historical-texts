<HEAD>A brief Narration, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 15th of <HI>October</HI> 1763, as I was at work with my father, on the banks of the <HI>Su&s;quehannah,</HI> the Indians, to the number of 135, came upon us and kil|led my father on the &s;pot. My brother <HI>Timothy,</HI> who was at work about half a mile di&s;tant, under|went the &s;ame fate; as did likewi&s;e 14 or 15 others, who were at work in different places.</P>
<P>The Indians, after they had burnt and de&s;troyed all they could, marched off, and carried me up the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> river 150 miles, to a town called by them <HI>Wethouooungque;</HI> and when we had arrived there, they tied me with a rope about my neck, and an Indian was ordered to lead me, while others beat me with their fi&s;ts: This they continued to do un|til I can about a quarter of a mile. When I arrived at one of their huts, they tied me to one of the &s;pars of the hut, where I remained all that night. The next day they let me loo&s;e, but would not let me go out of their &s;ight.</P>
<P>Here I tarried about three months, in which time I underwent many hard&s;hips, and had like to have fami&s;hed with hunger and cold, having nothing to cover me but an old coat and an old blanket, which was almo&s;t worn out. My employment was to
<PB N="3" REF="010652_0003_0F81BC094A9BE970">
fetch wood every day upon my back half a mile, which made me almo&s;t weary of my life.&mdash;At this place was brought a young <HI>Dutchman,</HI> who was ta|ken at the &s;ame time and place that I was; and when we had convenient opportunity, we laid our heads together to contrive an e&s;cape; to this end we &s;tole every thing we could without being di&s;covered, and hid it in the hollow of an old log.</P>
<P>It was about the latter end of March, as near as I could judge (for it rained &s;ucce&s;&s;ively three or four days, which melted away all the &s;now and brake up the river) when we had got together about 40 ears of corn, and &s;ix cakes of bread each, about the big|ne&s;s of an hand. The <HI>Dutchman</HI> tho't it now time for us to endeavour to make our e&s;cape, but I was very aver&s;e to his propo&s;al, telling him it would be better for us to wait till the &s;pring was farther ad|vanced, and the weather grew a little more warm: that we might endure the &s;everity of the nights when we &s;hould have nothing but the cold ground to re&s;t our limbs on, and the heavens to cover our almo&s;t uncovered bodies; but he was &s;o &s;tiflly bent in his opinion of going off the fir&s;t opportunity, that I was obliged to come into his mea&s;ures. The next day at noon we were &s;ent after wood at the u&s;ual place, when in&s;tead of returning back, we &s;at out with a de&s;ign to reach the neare&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettlement we could.&mdash; We ran all the afternoon till evening, when we made a &s;top and built a fire, where we re|mained during the night. Early next morning we &s;et out again, but had not gone far before the cold proved &s;o &s;evere that it froze the ends of my toes, and my mocka&s;ins being very thin and almo&s;t worn out, my toes wore off as fa&s;t as they froze. This
<PB N="4" REF="010652_0004_0F81BC0A1D8EE500">
&s;o far di&s;abled me that it was with great difficulty I could travel, yet we continued our way until about noon, when unable to go any farther, we &s;topt and made a fire, and after we had warmed and refre&s;hed our&s;elves, we &s;et out again, and about &s;un &s;et we arrived at a very thick &s;wamp in which we were &s;ecurely covered by the prodigious thickne&s;s of the hemlock, with which the &s;wamp abounded. We made a large fire, and notwith&s;tanding the fatigues of our march, and the pain that might be expected to ari&s;e from my toes being froze, and being as we aprehended out of danger of any enemy, we re&s;ted very comfortably all night. The next day very early we got on our way again; but the weather was &s;o cold that we were unable to proceed very far before we were obliged to make a halt, and to build a fire to keep us from freezing.&mdash;We &s;tayed in this place two days, when the weather began to moderate to &s;uch a degree that we could pur&s;ue our rout with le&s;s danger of being overcome with the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on: Sometimes we travelled all day, at other times but two or three hours in a day; &s;ometimes we &s;tayed two or three days in a place, altho' many times we had tolerable good weather. This remi&s;|ne&s;s began to make me very unea&s;y&mdash;I u&s;ed all the arguments I po&s;&s;ibly could with my companion to per&s;uade him to expedite our e&s;cape, but all to no purpo&s;e. Sometimes I got hold of his hand, with a view to force him along, but nothing would move him&mdash;It looks to me very probable, had we made the be&s;t u&s;e of our &s;hatter'd limbs, we might have reached &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fort or &s;ettlement before his death. In this di&s;mal condition I knew not what to do&mdash;leave him I could not, for we had but one
<PB N="5" REF="010652_0005_0F81BC0AC9D107F0">
hatchet, and the nights &s;till pretty cold, &s;o that we could not endure them without a fire.&mdash;Thus we moved on &s;lowly for &s;everal days, untill all our pro|vi&s;ions were &s;pent: By this time we had arrived at a &s;mall creek which extends its cour&s;e about S. E. and empties it&s;elf into the <HI>Su&s;quehannah.</HI></P>
<P>We had not gone far down this creek before we &s;topt, and built a fire, and &s;at down, but were &s;oon &s;urprized at the appearance of an <HI>Indian,</HI> who came very near before we di&s;covered each other. He no &s;ooner &s;aw us but he turn'd &s;hort about, and ran down by the creek; and as &s;oon as he was out of &s;ight, we made all the ha&s;te we could to a hill which lay a little before us, on the &s;outh &s;ide of which the &s;now was all gone and the ground dry, by which means we made our e&s;cape.&mdash;The <HI>Indian</HI> &s;oon alar|med hi&s; companions who lay at a little di&s;tance and pur&s;ued us, but the ground being &s;o dry and hard, it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to track us, which made them &s;oon give over pur&s;uing.&mdash;After tarrying on this hill two days, we proceeded on our way, but had nothing to eat but the bark of trees, on which alone we lived to days, without eating any thing el&s;e. The fourth day after we left this hill we be|gan to grow weary and faint, but the fear of an ene|my bani&s;hed all hunger from us. We continued travelling till the &s;eventh day, when we &s;topped again, when my companion, as I &s;uppo&s;e was over|come with fa&s;ting (tho' he never complained) and began to be unable to help him&s;elf. I nur&s;ed him as well as I could. The &s;econd day he made an at|tempt to go to a &s;pring at a &s;mall di&s;tance, but was &s;o weak he fell down &s;everal times before he could get there, it was with difficulty he got back
<PB N="6" REF="010652_0006_0F81BC0D85902DD8">
again; after this he never was able to walk any more.&mdash;I know whether he apprehended his end to be &s;o near, but the third night he died. The af|ternoon before his death he &s;aid but few words, tho' I often tried to di&s;cour&s;e with him. In the evening he told me, that <HI>if he died fir&s;t, he would not have me afraid to eat of his fle&s;h, for I am determin'd, &s;ays he, to eat of yours, if you &s;hould die before me.</HI></P>
<P>And now I was left all alone, &s;tript of every comfort of life, and knew not which way to turn my&s;elf. I thought the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity I was in, would excu&s;e my pur&s;uing the advice he gave me, of eating his fle&s;h as &s;oon as dead: I went immedi|ately about performing the di&s;agreeable operation, and cut off 5 or 6 pounds of his legs and thighs:&mdash;I left the re&s;t, and made the be&s;t way I could down the Creek. I had not travelled but four days before I arrived at an Indian town, where I was &s;oon di&s;|covered; and being taken up by them, they con|veyed me to one of their huts.</P>
<P>They demanded of me from whence I came? and after I had an&s;wered their demands, they gave me &s;ome parched corn to eat.</P>
<P>The next day all the Indians left their habitati|ons, and carried me directly back to the place from whence I had made my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>My old ma&s;ters being &s;o vexed at my leaving them, that they were re&s;olutely bent to have me burnt: But a coun&s;el being called upon the occa|&s;ion, they thought death too &s;evere a puni&s;hment, con&s;idering I was but young, and concluding that I &s;hould not have attempted an e&s;cape, had not the Dutchman enticed me away. Therefore they contented them&s;elves with ordering me to be whipt on the naked body.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010652_0007_0F81BC0E2F7D7C68">
Accordingly, next day I was brought forth, &s;trip'd &s;tark naked, and ordered to run; while the Indians, who were ranged in a row, at certain di&s;t|ances, in a mo&s;t cruel and barbarous manner, bela|boured me with their whips,&mdash;by which they &s;ometimes laid me level with the ground, by their blows.&mdash; Thus they continued to la&s;h me, until I had run about 40 rods, when I received a prodigi|ous blow from one of them, which &s;ettled me to the ground as quick as if I had been &s;hot through the heart. I was &s;o &s;tunned by the blow, that it &s;eems I &s;hould never have recovered again, had not an old &s;quaw run immediately to my relief, and helped me into her hut. By this time my whole body was covered with gore and blood.</P>
<P>I tarried here after this about 14 days, and then they &s;ent me up to the Senecas about 150 miles off. I lived here one year, in which time I &s;uffered al|mo&s;t in&s;urmountable hard&s;hips: being &s;ome times almo&s;t fami&s;hed to death with hunger, at othertimes greatly &s;uffering from the cold, and &s;ome times near peri&s;hing with both. For the mo&s;t part of the time we had nothing but ground nuts and herbs to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon in the &s;ummer, and red plums in the winter. Several of the Indians actually &s;tarv|ed to death.</P>
<P>From this place they carried me to Alaganey, a branch of the River Ohio, and from<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alagany is the name of a place upon the river of the &s;ame name.</HI></NOTE>Alaganey down the river to the place where it empties it&s;elf into the Ohio. After &s;taying here about a month, they carried me down the Ohio three hundred miles.&mdash; Here I found my indian father and mother
<PB N="8" REF="010652_0008_0F81BC0F62A074C8">
and was very kindly received by them, and all the other indians. They &s;upplied me with a good blanket and other nece&s;&s;ary cloathings and provi&s;i|ons in great plenty.</P>
<P><HI>And now the happy time began to draw near, when I &s;hould be relea&s;ed, for after I had been in this place three or four months, to my great joy an Indian came from Sir William John&s;on, with orders that all the pri&s;oners &s;hould be relea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And after they had &s;triped me of almo&s;t every thing I had about me, I was conducted by my guide to Fort Du-Que&s;ne, where I was delivered up to the command|ing officer, and clothing was ordered for me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But having undergone &s;o many hard&s;hips during my &s;tay among the &s;avages, I looked like a mere &s;keleton.&mdash;I remained here about eleven months; at the end of which I was &s;ent to Philadelphia, where I tarried about three months, from thence I went to New Borough, where I arrived the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Day of April, 1767, to the great joy of my mother, brothers and &s;i&s;ters. Being ab&s;ent three years and &s;ix months.</HI></P>
<P>I would take this opportunity to return my mo&s;t unfeigned thanks to all tho&s;e gentlemen and ladies who were &s;o generous as to contribute a con&s;idera|ble &s;um of money on my behalf.</P>
