<OPENER><SALUTE>May it Plea&s;e Your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Arguments for &s;ending Bi&s;hops of the Church of En|gland to America, are &s;o &s;trong and convincing, that an Appeal may be made to the World for the Rea&s;on|ablene&s;s of &s;ending them. The ge|neral Plan which has been long &s;ettled for the Regulation of their Authority when &s;ent, is &s;o well calculated to &s;ecure the religious Privileges of every
<PB N="ii" REF="010578_0004_0F86F07A8A858310">
Denomination of Chri&s;tians, that no|thing more than a proper Explanation can be needful, to recommend it to the Approbation of every candid and unprejudiced Per&s;on. For Want of this, many are &s;till aver&s;e to an Ame|rican Epi&s;copate, and &s;ome are indu&s;|triou&s;ly employed in mi&s;repre&s;enting the Matter, and in propagating their Prejudices and Objections again&s;t it. It is therefore the general Opinion here, that it is at length become ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to explain this Plan, and thereby, as the mo&s;t effectual Method, to remove the&s;e Prejudices and Ob|jections.</P>
<P>Such, <HI>My Lord,</HI> is the De&s;ign of the following <HI>Appeal.</HI> The Author of it was not forward to undertake the Work. Want of Lei&s;ure, and a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Inability to execute it properly, were Difficulties in his Way not ea&s;y to be &s;urmounted. But as no one appeared that was willing to
<PB N="iii" REF="010578_0004_0F86F07A8A858310">
perform what all &s;eemed to allow was nece&s;&s;ary to be done, and as he was reque&s;ted by many of his Brethren to undertake it, he finally con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Without this Apology, the Author would not pre&s;ume to in&s;cribe to <HI>Your Grace</HI> &s;o imperfect a Piece, or to a&s;k for it your Patronage. Nor indeed would any Apology ju&s;tify him in doing &s;o, did he not know that <HI>Your Grace</HI> takes a Plea&s;ure in encou|raging every <HI>well-meant</HI> Endeavour, however un&s;ucce&s;sful it may prove, to &s;erve the Cau&s;e of Religion and the Church of Chri&s;t&mdash;of which amiable Di&s;po&s;ition your whole Life has been a Proof.</P>
<P>As to the Church of England in <HI>America,</HI> it will ever be acknowledged with all Thankfulne&s;s, that none has &s;hewn for it a more affectionate Con|cern, or treated the Members of it or its Clergy with more Kindne&s;s and
<PB N="iv" REF="010578_0005_0F86F07B4CB5B538">
Conde&s;cen&s;ion than <HI>Your Grace.</HI> Se|veral of them You have honoured with a private Corre&s;pondence; and but few have gone Home from this Coun|try for Holy Orders for a long Cour&s;e of Years, who have not been able on their Return, to tell of the great Obligations You have conferred upon them. And this was the Ca&s;e long before your Advancement to that high Station, whereby You became related to all of them as their Metropolitan, and to many of them al&s;o as Pre&s;ident of <HI>the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign Parts.</HI></P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e particular Kindne&s;&s;es &s;hewn to the Clergy, the general State and Intere&s;t of the American Church, has always been the Object of your clo&s;e, and careful, and anxious Atten|tion. None has ever entered &s;o deeply into the Knowledge of her Condition, or had &s;o true a Sen&s;e of her Wants, or repre&s;ented them to the Public in
<PB N="v" REF="010578_0005_0F86F07B4CB5B538">
&s;o proper and &s;triking a Light, as <HI>Your Grace</HI> did many Years ago, in your mo&s;t excellent <HI>anniver&s;ary Ser|mon</HI> preached before <HI>the Society.</HI> Therein particularly You explained the Need and U&s;efulne&s;s of an American Epi&s;copate; and what You then &s;aid and publi&s;hed on the Subject, together with what You have continued to &s;peak and write ever &s;ince, on all proper Occa&s;ions, has probably contributed more to prepare the Way for it, &s;o far as it has been prepared, than what has been &s;aid, and written, and done, by any other Per&s;on. For the&s;e Things, as well as on other Accounts, the Clergy and Friends of the Church in America revere You, with Sentiments of the &s;incere&s;t Gratitude. They look up to <HI>Your Grace</HI> as eminently their Friend and Patron; and they can ne|ver de&s;pair of the Succe&s;s of their late Application, while &s;o rea&s;onable a Cau&s;e is &s;upported by your Abilities and Influence.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="010578_0006_0F86F07C0E81E1E8">At the &s;ame Time they are not in|&s;en&s;ible of the Obligations they are under to many other illu&s;trious Per|&s;ons, and e&s;pecially to &s;ome great Prelates of the Church, who have been plea&s;ed to become their Advocates on this Occa&s;ion: And it is not doubted but they will continue to a&s;&s;i&s;t and co-operate with <HI>Your Grace</HI> in this good Work, of re&s;cuing the Ameri|can Church from the Di&s;tre&s;s &s;he is under, through the Want of an Epi&s;|copate. Every Attempt to relieve her, <HI>My Lord,</HI> is really an Act of Charity; and it may properly be &s;aid that "the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>her</HI> that is ready to peri&s;h," will come upon tho&s;e that befriend her in this Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>As the following Papers were drawn up with a View of &s;erving the Cau&s;e, which you have always had &s;o greatly at Heart, and been foremo&s;t in promo|ting, <HI>in that Re&s;pect</HI> they can be ad|dre&s;&s;ed to none &s;o properly as to <HI>Your

<P>If it may be received al&s;o as a Te&s;timony of Gratitude, for particular Favours which <HI>Your Grace</HI> has con|de&s;cended to be&s;tow on the Author, it will add greatly to his Happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Adverti&s;ement to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following <HI>Appeal,</HI> has &s;aid, by Way of Apology, that
<Q>he was reque&s;ted by many of his Brethren to undertake it.</Q>
He thinks it not ami&s;s to declare more particularly, with the &s;ame View, that the Ta&s;k was fir&s;t impo&s;ed upon him by the very worthy and Reverend Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> of <HI>Strat|ford</HI> in <HI>Connecticut.</HI> From that venerable Per&s;on a Work of this Nature would have come, with more Propriety, and greater Advantage to the Cau&s;e. For <HI>an Appeal to the Public in Behalf of the Church of England in America,</HI> on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, could be made by none &s;o properly, or with &s;o good Effect, as by him, who has &s;o frequently &s;ignalized him&s;elf as its Advocate, for the Cour&s;e of more than Forty Years, and who, for a con&s;iderable Part of that Time, has been anxiou&s;ly &s;olliciting the Cau&s;e of an American Epi&s;copate. But a Tremor in the Hand, which cau&s;es him to write with the utmo&s;t Difficulty him&s;elf, made it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould leave the Work for another. He thought proper to apply to the Author, who&s;e Obligations to him were &s;uch, that he could not refu&s;e him any Thing in his Power, without incuring the Imputation of Ingratitude and Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>At the Time when this Treaty was nearly concluded, the Clergy of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> being met together in a <HI>voluntary Convention,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of their Brethren from the neighbouring Pro|vinces, took into Con&s;ideration the Propriety and Ex|pediency of addre&s;&s;ing the Public, on the Subject of an American Epi&s;copate. After a thorough Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Point, they were unanimou&s;ly of Opinion, that fair|ly to explain the Plan on which American Bi&s;hops had
<PB N="x" REF="010578_0008_0F86F07EB1052220" MS="y">
been reque&s;ted, to lay before the Public the Rea&s;ons of this Reque&s;t, to an&s;wer the Objections that had been made, and to obviate tho&s;e that might be otherwi&s;e conceived again&s;t it, was not only proper and expedient, but a Matter of Nece&s;&s;ity and Duty. It was accor|dingly voted that Something to this Purpo&s;e &s;hould be publi&s;hed, and the Author was appointed to this Ser|vice&mdash;with Liberty, however, to make the Time of his performing it mo&s;t convenient to him&s;elf. Excu&s;es were not admitted, and a Refu&s;al could not be ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>The Author, being brought thus under double En|gagements, determined to acquit him&s;elf as well as his Circum&s;tances and Abilities would permit. In Order to this, he was careful to follow the Directions he had received, and, as he had Opportunity, to con&s;ult the mo&s;t judicious of his Friends, in Regard to the Method and Management of the Work. How he has &s;uc|ceeded, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the Judgment of the Reader, who&s;e Candour is reque&s;ted.</P>
<P>It gives the Author great Plea&s;ure, to find that his Sentiments have been &s;o clearly and forcibly expre&s;&s;ed, by <HI>The Right Reverend the Lord Bi&s;hop of Lan|daff,</HI> in his excellent anniver&s;ary Sermon preached be|fore <HI>the Society</HI> in <HI>February</HI> la&s;t. The Thanks of every Friend of the American Church are due to <HI>His Lord&s;hip,</HI> for &s;o &s;ea&s;onable and &s;pirited an A&s;&s;ertion and Vindication of its Rights; from which it is not doubted but the following Extract will be acceptable to the Reader, although for Want of Room it mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be &s;hort.</P>
<P><Q><HI>The want of Bi&s;hops (in America) hath been all along the more heavily lamented, becau&s;e it is a ca&s;e &s;o &s;ingular, that it cannot be paral|leled in the Chri&s;tian world. For what &s;ect was ever any where at all allowed, that was not
<PB N="xi" REF="010578_0008_0F86F07EB1052220">
allowed the means within them&s;elves of providing for the continual exerci&s;e of their wor&s;hip? the granting one without the other would be but a mockery, Yet &s;uch is the &s;tate of our church in the colonies; and at a time, and in a realm, where the rights of con&s;cience are be&s;t under|&s;tood, and mo&s;t fully allowed and protected. All &s;ects of Prote&s;tant Chri&s;tians at home, and all, &s;ave one, throughout our colonies, have the full enjoyment of their religion. Even the Ro|mi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, within a province lately added to the Briti&s;h dominions, is completely allowed in all points; it hath Bi&s;hops.&mdash;Thus &s;tands the ca&s;e of all churches in our colonies, except only the church here by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; that alone is not tolerated in the whole, it exi&s;ts only in part, in a maimed &s;tate, lopt of Epi&s;copacy, an e&s;&s;ential part of its con&s;titution. And whence this di&s;graceful di&s;tinction? whence this mark of di&s;tru&s;t? what is the fear? what the danger? A few per&s;ons ve&s;ted with authority to ordain mini&s;ters, to confirm youth, and to vi&s;it their own clergy. Can two or three per&s;ons, re&s;train|ed to the&s;e &s;piritual functions, be dangerous to any in any matter? in what? or to whom? Can they po&s;&s;ibly, &s;o limited, on any pretence what|ever, attempt to mole&s;t any in their religious concerns? Can they invade the rights and juri&s;|diction of magi&s;trates? Can they infringe the liberties of the people? Can they weaken, or be thought di&s;po&s;ed to weaken, the fidelity of the colonies to his Maje&s;ty, or their dependence on this country? To the&s;e duties, if there be any difference, the members of this church, as &s;uch are bound by one &s;pecial motive, be&s;ides the many motives common to them with other &s;ub|jects.</HI></Q>

<HEAD>AN APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT Application has been lately made to our Superiors, by the Clergy of &s;everal of the Colonies, reque&s;ting one or more <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> to be &s;ent to <HI>America,</HI> is a Matter now generally known, and was never intended to be kept as a Secret. As there is great Rea&s;on to hope, both from a Review of the Arguments that were offered in the Support of Addre&s;&s;es that were tran&s;mit|ted on the Occa&s;ion, and from the favourable Di&s;po&s;ition of many in Authority, that this Reque&s;t in due Time will be granted; it has been thought
<PB N="2" REF="010578_0010_0F86F080B0A56E20">
proper, in a public Manner, to inform all who may imagine them&s;elves to be any Ways concer|ned in the Event of our Application, <HI>candidly</HI> and <HI>explicitly,</HI> for what Rea&s;ons, and with what Views, an <HI>American Epi&s;copate</HI> is &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired by the Clergy, and the other Friends and Members of the Church.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons are &s;aid to have been alarmed by this Conduct of the Clergy; but when the Ca&s;e &s;hall be duly explained and under&s;tood, it is not apprehended that any Unea&s;ine&s;s will remain, or that any Oppo&s;ition can be formed again&s;t the Execution of a Plan, &s;o rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Church here, and &s;o univer&s;ally harmle&s;s to others of every Denomination. As no Inva&s;ion of the civil or religious Privileges of any, whether Churchmen or Di&s;&s;enters, is thereby in|tended, it is hoped that every Objection, or even Doubt or Su&s;picion of that Nature, will, by this Method, be intirely obviated. But &s;hould any Objections continue which &s;hall be thought to de|&s;erve Notice, the Objectors are invited to pro|po&s;e them in &s;uch a Manner, that they may be fairly and candidly debated, before the Tribunal of the Publick; and if none &s;hall be offered, it will be taken for granted that all Parties acquie&s;ce and are &s;atisfied.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. A Sketch of the Arguments in Favour of Epi&s;copacy.</HEAD>
<P>IN Order to judge properly of the Subject before us, it is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. I.</NOTE> and it &s;hould be well con&s;idered, that the Church of England is <HI>E|pi&s;copal,</HI> and con&s;equently holds the Nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops to govern the Church, and to confer Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Powers upon others. Of this there can be no Di&s;pute, &s;ince many of her public Offices, and indeed the whole Sy&s;tem of her Conduct with Regard to the Clergy is founded on this Principle.</P>
<P>In the general Preface to the Ordination Offices &s;he declares, that
<Q>it is evident to all Men dili|gently reading the Holy Scriptures and ancient Authors, that from the Apo&s;tles Time there has been this Order in Chri&s;t's Church, Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons, as &s;everal Offices.</Q>
And her Practice of admiting none to officiate as Clergy|men, who have not been ordained by Bi&s;hops, is a Proof, that &s;he e&s;teems every other Ordination to be, at lea&s;t, irregular and defective. It is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enter upon a particular Defence of this Doctrine, in an Undertaking of this Nature; &s;ince our pre&s;ent Plea is equally valid, whether the&s;e Principles are founded rightly or wrongly. How|ever, a <HI>brief Sketch</HI> of the Arguments, whereby the Nece&s;&s;ity of Epi&s;copal Government is defended, may, on this Occa&s;ion, be not altogether u&s;ele&s;s or improper.</P>
<P>It is an e&s;&s;ential Doctrine of the Church of Eng|land, that none can have any Authority in the
<PB N="4" REF="010578_0011_0F86F08207C54200" MS="y">
Chri&s;tian Church, but tho&s;e who derive it from Chri&s;t, either <HI>mediately</HI> or <HI>immediately.</HI> Tho&s;e who receive Authority <HI>immediately</HI> from Chri&s;t, before they can expect Submi&s;&s;ion to it from others, mu&s;t be able to prove that they have it; for which no|thing le&s;s can &s;uffice, at this Day, than the Power of working Miracles. Tho&s;e who receive it <HI>medi|ately,</HI> mu&s;t derive it from tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom Chri&s;t has authorized to convey it, <HI>i. e.</HI> they mu&s;t receive it by a regular Succe&s;&s;ion. For any to &s;ay, that &s;uch a Succe&s;&s;ion cannot be proved, is in&s;uffi|cient: it is incumbent on the Objectors to prove that the Succe&s;&s;ion, by which we hold, has been in|terrupted. Proof of this, although zealou&s;ly at|tempted, has never yet been made; and could this Point once be made clear, it would al&s;o prove far|ther, that Chri&s;t has neglected to provide for his Church, in a Ca&s;e &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the very Being of it, notwith&s;tanding his having expre&s;sly promi&s;ed to be "ever with it, to the End of the World."</P>
<P>Men may ridicule the Notion of <HI>uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> as they plea&s;e; but if the Authority of the Clergy is derived from Chri&s;t, (and if it is not, they are no Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t) they mu&s;t receive it in one of the Ways already mentioned. And if the Succe&s;&s;ion be <HI>once</HI> broken, and the Power of Ordi|nation <HI>once</HI> lo&s;t, not all the Men on Earth&mdash;not all the Angels in Heaven, without an immediate Com|mi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, can re&s;tore it. It is as great an Ab&s;urdity, on <HI>St. Paul's</HI> Principles, for a Man to preach without being properly <HI>&s;ent,</HI> as it is to hear without a Preacher, or to believe in him of whom we have never heard.</P>
<P>As Chri&s;t is the great Founder of the Church, &s;o he is the only Fountain of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Autho|rity. Whatever general Laws he was plea&s;ed to
<PB N="5" REF="010578_0011_0F86F08207C54200" MS="y">
injoin, mu&s;t be of indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligation to all his Followers. Indeed, with Regard to the Go|vernment of the Church, his Laws are expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch general Terms, that we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have Recour&s;e to tho&s;e, whom he immediately in|tru&s;ted with the Government of his Church, for a more particular Explanation of them.</P>
<P>That the Apo&s;tles,
<Q>to whom he &s;hewed him&s;elf alive after his Pa&s;&s;ion, being &s;een of them Forty Days, and &s;peaking of the Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God,</Q> under&s;tood the Laws of Chri&s;t, is not to be doubted: and, as they were al&s;o conducted by the Spirit of God, the more ex|plicit and particular Rules which <HI>they</HI> have given for the Government of the Church, mu&s;t be re|ceived&mdash;either as authentic Explanations of Chri&s;t's general Laws, or as Regulations that are agreeable and conformable to them. To this mu&s;t be ad|ded, that the public <HI>Practice</HI> of the Apo&s;tles is a faithful and plain Comment on the Laws of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s we can &s;uppo&s;e them to have been unacquainted with, or di&s;obedient to, his divine Will; and it is of equal Authority with any written In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Now if we carefully examine the Writings of the Apo&s;tles, and the <HI>Canonical</HI> Records of their Pro|ceedings, I mu&s;t think that the&s;e Things will evi|dently appear,&mdash;that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, before his A&s;cen&s;ion, committed the Government of his Church upon Earth, intirely to <HI>them</HI>&mdash;that this Government was <HI>exerci&s;ed</HI> by them&mdash;that they <HI>con|veyed</HI> this Power to others, to be communicated &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to others, to the late&s;t Po&s;terity&mdash;par|ticularly, that the&s;e their Succe&s;&s;ors were an Order di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, tho&s;e who are now called Pre&s;byters&mdash;and that none who were not of

this highe&s;t Order, had the Powers of Ordination and Government committed to them. It would lead me too far from my pre&s;ent De&s;ign, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the&s;e Points by particular Proof; nor can it be nece&s;&s;ary, as &s;everal of the Facts that &s;upport them, have been brought to a clo&s;e Examination, and fairly &s;tated to the Public, in the In&s;tances of <HI>James</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Timothy</HI> at <HI>Ephe&s;us, Titus</HI> at <HI>Crete,</HI> the Angels of the Seven Churches of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Archbi&s;hop</HI> Potter on Church Government. <HI>See al&s;o Mr.</HI> Leaming's Defence of the Epi&s;copal Government, &amp;c. <HI>again&s;t the Ob|jections of Mr.</HI> Welles <HI>and Dr.</HI> Chauncy.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider what Evidence ari&s;es to fa|vour the&s;e Conclu&s;ions, from the general State of the <HI>Primitive Church.</HI> The Travels of &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles are related in Scripture, and from thence, as well as from other Proofs, it appears, that with amazing Succe&s;s they planted and &s;ettled Churches in all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Countries of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> within the Compa&s;s of not many Years. And it is a Fact well known, that all the Churches that were gathered during the <HI>Fir&s;t Century,</HI> whe|ther immediately by the Apo&s;tles, or their Mi&s;|&s;ionaries, were under the Direction of &s;ome or other of that venerable Order. Men of the mo&s;t eminent and undoubted Piety, who had been ho|noured with their intimate Acquaintance, were ap|pointed by the Apo&s;tles to &s;uperintend Churches in certain limited Di&s;tricts, &s;ome of whom were cho&s;en to &s;ucceed them in tho&s;e Churches which they had always kept under their own more im|mediate In&s;pection. So that during this Period, while the Chri&s;tian Church was governed by the Apo&s;tles, and others of their Appointment, no|thing, in our Opinion, but gro&s;s Prejudice, or a
<PB N="7" REF="010578_0012_0F86F082122E9638" MS="y">
wrangling and captious Di&s;po&s;ition, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, can lead any to &s;u&s;pect or a&s;&s;ert, that it was ma|terially corrupted, or that it had departed, in any con&s;iderable Degree, from that Plan of Govern|ment which Chri&s;t had in&s;tituted. The Govern|ment of the Church is as much a po&s;itive In&s;titu|tion as the Chri&s;tian Sacraments, and the Laws relating to it bind us as &s;trongly, as the Laws which oblige us to receive Bapti&s;m or the Holy Euchari&s;t. As &s;uch they were con&s;idered in the Period we are treating of; and any Attempt to change them would have been treated with the &s;ame Indignation and Re&s;entment by the Chri&s;tians of that Age, as if the Laws relating to the Sacra|ments had been wilfully violated.</P>
<P>And if we con&s;ider the general Character of Chri&s;tians, and the State of the Church, in the <HI>Second</HI> and <HI>Third Centuries,</HI> we &s;hall find it not ea&s;y to believe, that there could have been any e&s;&s;en|tial Variation or Departure, from the original Plan of Di&s;cipline and Government committed to the Church. Chri&s;tianity &s;till continued to be attack|ed with all the Engines of worldly Power and Policy, and had nothing to &s;upport it, but its own rational Evidence, accompanied with the Power and Spirit of God, and the Expectation of Happine&s;s in an invi&s;ible State. But very few worldly Pro&s;pects and Motives could operate either on the Clergy or private Chri&s;tians, when they all knew that their Religion tended to deprive them of all worldly Ad|vantages, and would probably cau&s;e them to be a|bu&s;ed, and in&s;ulted, and per&s;ecuted, even to Death. Their only Dependance was on their a&s;cended Re|deemer, for who&s;e Sake, and in Obedience to whom, they &s;acrificed all the Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s and Glory of the World, e&s;teeming them but as
<PB N="8" REF="010578_0013_0F86F082CB7A27F8">
Dro&s;s and Dung in Competition with their Duty: In this State, and with this Di&s;po&s;ition, every Law of Chri&s;t was valued more than Life, every re|ceived U&s;age and Practice of the Church was re|vered as &s;acred, by Chri&s;tians in general.</P>
<P>And as we are obliged to believe, that but few could have been de&s;irous of making Innovations, &s;o it is utterly incredible that many would have been willing to &s;ubmit to them, in Matters of Im|portance. How firmly the Chri&s;tians of tho&s;e Days were attached to, and how con&s;cientiou&s;ly they followed, whatever they e&s;teemed to be an In|&s;titution of Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles, the <HI>Quarto-de|ciman</HI> Controver&s;y, or the Di&s;pute which divided the Church about the proper Time for the keeping of <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> among others, is a noted Proof. And although in this Point one Party mu&s;t have been mi&s;taken, yet it is manife&s;tly a Matter of no great Con&s;equence, and the Church at that Time was <HI>divided</HI> in their Judgment: and, it by no Means follows from this In&s;tance, that the Church might al&s;o have been mi&s;taken in Matters of the greate&s;t Weight, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Faith and Government, e&s;pecially when all were <HI>united</HI> in Opinion.</P>
<P>And as the Practice of the primitive Church was a faithful Comment on the Laws of Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, relating to the Government of the Church; &s;o it is not &s;o difficult a Matter, to di&s;|cover what that Practice was, as &s;ome may ima|gine, The Works of the Apo&s;tolical Fathers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Authenticity of &s;ome of the&s;e has been warmly di&s;puted, e&s;pecially of the Epi&s;tles of <HI>St. Ignatius</HI>; and Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> has, within a few Years, in an Appendix to his <HI>Dudleian Lecture,</HI> endeavoured mo&s;t zealou&s;ly to invalidate their Te&s;timony. But the Doctor undoubtedly knows that he has been able to offer no|thing <HI>new</HI> on &s;o exhau&s;ted a Subject; and others know, that he has &s;aid Nothing again&s;t the Authenticity of the&s;e Epi&s;tles, but what has, long ago, been fairly and fully confuted</P>
<P>Although the Advocates for Epi&s;copacy &s;ee no Nece&s;&s;ity for giving up the Te&s;timony of <HI>St. Ignatius,</HI> it is not from an Opinion that their Cau&s;e would labour under any great Di&s;tre&s;s, without that Support. It has a much &s;urer Foundation to re&s;t upon, and they are willing to have it tried on the Footing of pure Scripture Evidence, as well as that of publick and notorious Facts.</P>
<P>Hard is the Fate of ancient Writers! For if they do not luckily countenance modern Opinions, either their Credit will be directly attacked, or their Arguments ridiculed or &s;ophi&s;tically evaded; and if nothing le&s;s will &s;erve the Authenticity of their Writings, and perhaps that &s;uch Per&s;ons ever exi&s;ted, will be di&s;puted. And when an ob&s;tinate Oppo&s;ition is once undertaken, whether from Intere&s;t, or Spleen and Malignity, no ancient Authors are &s;o &s;ecure, not even &s;ome of tho&s;e of the Holy Bible, but that &s;uch Adventurers may be able to do &s;ome Injury to their Reputation and Authority. This Remark accounts for much of the Oppo&s;i|tion <HI>St. Ignatius</HI> met with in the la&s;t Century: Prejudice and a par|tial Attachment to particular Sy&s;tems may probably account for the Remainder.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Hardouin,</HI> who&s;e general literary Character was not con|temptible, is a remarkable In&s;tance to what Lengths Prejudice, or rather an incomprehen&s;ibly whim&s;ical Humour, may carry a Man, in Ca&s;es of this Nature. In a large Work of his, printed in <HI>Paris</HI> 1693,
<Q>He undertakes to prove from Medals, that the greater Part of tho&s;e Authors, which have pa&s;&s;ed upon the Moderns for ancient, were forged by &s;ome Monks of the xiiith Century, who gave to them the &s;everal Names of Homer&punc; Plato, Ari&s;totle, Plutarch, &amp;c. Tertullian, Origen, Ba&s;il, Augu&s;tine, &amp;c. He only excepts out of this monki&s;h Manufacture, the Works of Cicero, Pliny's Natural Hi&s;tory, Virgil's Georgicks, and Horace's Satyrs and Epi&s;tles. The&s;e he &s;uppo&s;es the only genuine Monu|ments of Antiquity remaining, except &s;ome few In&s;criptions and Fa&s;te; and with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e, he thinks that the&s;e Monks drew up and fa&s;hioned all the other ancient Writings, as Terence Plays, Livy's and Tacitus's Hi&s;tory, Virgil's Aeneid, Horace's Odes, &amp;c nay he pu&s;hed this Chimera &s;o far, that he fancied he could &s;ee plainly enough, that Aeneas in Virgil was de&s;igned for Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and Horace's Mi&s;tre&s;s Lalage for the Chri&s;tian Religion.</Q>

Now the&s;e all agree in their Account of the general Practice and Government of the Church, and the Evidence ari&s;ing from the Whole, appears to us to be of irre|&s;i&s;tible Force in Favour of Epi&s;copacy; and in the Opinion of Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> one of the be&s;t Rea&s;oners the Engli&s;h Nation ever produced, it amounts even to a <HI>Demon&s;tration.</HI> It greatly con|cerns tho&s;e who can re&s;i&s;t this Evidence, to be very careful that the &s;ame Arguments whereby they endeavour to overthrow the Weight of it, do not al&s;o operate with equal Force again&s;t the Authen|ticity of the Canonical Books of the New Te&s;ta|ment.</P>
<P>It is generally allowed by the Rejecters of Epi&s;|copacy, that Epi&s;copal Government obtained very early in the Church. Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his Lectures, &amp;c. Page <HI>498.</HI></NOTE> admits, that
<Q>the Di&s;tinction between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters has been as ancient as the Time of St. <HI>Ignatius:</HI></Q> i. e. the Beginning of the Second Century, and within Seven or Eight Years after the Death of the la&s;t of the Apo&s;tles. Now if this Government was not of Apo&s;tolical In&s;titution, a general U&s;urpa|tion mu&s;t have been attempted&mdash;the Attempt mu&s;t have &s;ucceeded&mdash;and a capital Revolution mu&s;t have been e&s;tabli&s;hed and completely &s;ettled
<PB N="11" REF="010578_0014_0F86F08563B9D408">
throughout the Church within a very few Years of the Apo&s;tles Death. Tho&s;e Powers which were now given to a new Order of Officers, mu&s;t have been quietly abdicated by their former Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and the whole Chri&s;tian Church mu&s;t have been per&s;uaded to give up a Form of Government, which had been con&s;ecrated by the Practice and Authority of the Apo&s;tles, and then to &s;ubmit to a new Form, which they had never experienced or heard of. Surely &s;o great and &s;trange a Work could never have been accompli&s;hed in &s;o &s;hort a Time, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;upernatural Power; and the Enemies of Epi&s;copacy mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that a very extraordinary Miracle mu&s;t, on this Suppo&s;ition, have been wrought in Favour of it.</P>
<P>If the Experiment &s;hould be made at this Day, what Addre&s;s would it require, what a tedious Proce&s;s would be found nece&s;&s;ary, to pro&s;elyte even a &s;ingle national Church, that of <HI>Scotland</HI> for In&s;tance, which holds Epi&s;copacy to have been an Innovation in the Chri&s;tian Church, to a peace|able Submi&s;&s;ion to it? And yet no modern Chri|&s;tians can pretend a greater Veneration and Zeal for apo&s;tolical In&s;titutions, than the primitive Chri&s;tians were undoubtedly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. What long Struggles and violent Convul&s;ions have al|ways been &s;uffered, before any Republican Govern|ments have been brought to acquie&s;ce in a Change to Monarchy? And yet Men have commonly been found as ready to give up the e&s;tabli&s;hed Forms of Civil Government as tho&s;e of Religion.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a Change to have happened, can any tolerable Rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned, why no Re|cords, no Intimations of it are to be found in Hi&s;tory? Can it be imagined, that while many trifling Occurrences in compari&s;on, &s;uch as the

Or, are we able, from this univer&s;al Silence of Hi&s;tory, to form any other Conclu&s;ion, than that the Event in Que&s;tion has never happened?</P>
<P>Let us hear on this Subject a very celebrated Writer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Chillingworth <HI>in his</HI> Demon&s;tration of Epi&s;copacy.</NOTE>.
<Q>When I &s;hall &s;ee therefore all the Fables in the <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> acted, and prove true Stories; when I &s;hall &s;ee all the Democracies and Ari&s;tocra&s;ies in the World lie down and &s;leep, and awake into Monarchies; then will I begin to believe that Pre&s;byterial Government, having continued in the Church, during the Apo&s;tles Times, &s;hould pre&s;ently after (again&s;t the Apo|&s;tles Doctrine and the Will of Chri&s;t) be whirled about like a Scene in a Ma&s;que, and tran&s;|formed into Epi&s;copacy. In the mean Time while the&s;e Things remain thus incredible, and, in human Rea&s;on, impo&s;&s;ible, I hope I &s;hall have Leave to conclude thus:</Q></P>
<Q><P>Epi&s;copal Government is acknowledged to have been univer&s;ally received in the Church, pre&s;ently after the Apo&s;tles Times:</P>
<P>Between the Apo&s;tles Times and this <HI>pre&s;ently after,</HI> there was not Time enough for, nor Po&s;|&s;ibility of, &s;o great an Alteration:</P>
<P>And therefore there was no &s;uch Alteration as is pretended; and therefore Epi&s;copacy being confe&s;&s;ed to be &s;o ancient and Catholic, mu&s;t be granted al&s;o to be Apo&s;tolic.</P></Q>

<P>THE Epi&s;copal Order appearing thus to be di&s;tinct from,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. II.</NOTE> and &s;uperior to that of Pre&s;|byters, it is proper now to enquire, wherein that Di&s;tinction and Superiority con&s;i&s;ts. In Order to this, we mu&s;t carefully &s;eparate the &s;everal Things that have been added as <HI>Appendages</HI> to the Epi&s;|copal Office, from tho&s;e which originally and e&s;&s;entially belong to it. In Chri&s;tian Countries, the Alliance between the Church and State has obtained for the former many Perqui&s;ites and Ad|vantages of an external Nature, which may be reduced to the three Heads of, legal Exemption, temporal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and civil Power. The&s;e have generally varied in different Countries and Ages; and although they have influenced the external Form and Appearance of the Church, yet they have not altered its real Nature, which is always and e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame under all outward Circum|&s;tances, whether protected, neglected or per&s;e|cuted, by the Powers of the World.</P>
<P>Thus the Woman, in the Vi&s;ions of St. <HI>John</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii.</NOTE>, was the very &s;ame, after
<Q>&s;he fled into the Wil|derne&s;s,</Q> and was pur&s;ued by the Dragon, as when &s;he
<Q>was clothed with the Sun, had a Crown of Twelve Stars on her Head, and the Moon under her Feet,</Q>
notwith&s;tanding that her out|ward
<PB N="14" REF="010578_0016_0F86F087516648E0">
Circum&s;tances and Figure were widely dif|ferent. Every one knows that the Office of a Clergyman is the &s;ame, whether he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Fortune, or is without one&mdash;whether he has a large Pari&s;h, or a &s;mall one. And if the&s;e things make no Alteration in the Office of a Pre&s;byter, it will be hard to &s;hew why they &s;hould alter the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Office, and why it &s;hould not be exactly the &s;ame now, as it was before the Days of <HI>Con|&s;tantine.</HI></P>
<P>As worldly Pro&s;perity or Adver&s;ity does not affect the Nature of the Office, &s;o neither does the Location nor Limitation of it with Regard to Place. He who has a &s;mall Dioce&s;s, has the &s;ame Epi&s;copal Powers, as he that has a large one; and it matters not, as to the Validity of the Act, whether it is performed by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Man,</HI> or the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>&mdash;or, in the Lan|guage of St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> whether by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Rhegium,</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> or <HI>Eugubium,</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> or <HI>Tanais.</HI></P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent Inquiry therefore, leads us to the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e Powers only, which, being in&s;eparable from the Office, and peculiar to it, all Bi&s;hops, as &s;uch, are equally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and without which they would cea&s;e to be Bi&s;hops: and the&s;e will be found to be the Powers of <HI>Government, Ordination</HI> and <HI>Confirmation.</HI></P>
<P>The Power or Right of <HI>Government</HI> is nece&s;|&s;arily included in the Superiority of their Office. For in every Society, where there is a Subordi|nation of Offices, that which con&s;titutes the highe&s;t Office is the legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the highe&s;t Power; and the &s;uperintending and governing Power, being &s;uperior to all others, mu&s;t of Con&s;equence

In the Chri&s;tian Church, the Apo&s;tles were inve&s;ted with this Power by Chri&s;t&mdash;as it was intended for perpetual U&s;e, they conveyed it to their Succe&s;&s;ors&mdash;it was exer|ci&s;ed by <HI>Timothy</HI> at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> by <HI>Titus</HI> at <HI>Crete,</HI> by <HI>Dyoni&s;ius the Arcopagite</HI> at <HI>Athens,</HI> by <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> at <HI>Philippi,</HI> by <HI>Archippus</HI> at <HI>Colo&s;&s;&eacute;,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;and, through all the Ages of the Church, it has been tran&s;mitted down and maintained by the Epi&s;copal Order; who, in the exerci&s;e of it, have occa&s;ionally and frequently taken the Advice of their Pre&s;by|ters. The Bi&s;hop may communicate this Power, in &s;ome Degree, to Pre&s;byters or others as he &s;hall think proper; but in &s;uch Ca&s;es, it mu&s;t be exer|ci&s;ed in Subordination to him, for he can never dive&s;t him&s;elf of his controlling and &s;uperintending Authority. It is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to his Office, that he cannot relinqui&s;h it in &s;uch a Manner, as not to be accountable for the Exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The Epi&s;tles to the Seven Churches of the <HI>Lydian A&s;ia</HI> are a Proof of this, and &s;hew plainly, that the Government of tho&s;e Churches re&s;pectively, was lodged in the Hands of &s;ingle Per&s;ons, who are called <HI>Angels</HI>; by which was meant and intended, according to the united Voice of Antiquity, <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> in the appropriated Sen&s;e. Some of the&s;e are reproved for the Relaxation of Di&s;cipline, and all of them are treated as having the intire Government of their re&s;pective Di&s;tricts, and as accountable for the State of Religion within the Bounds of their Spiritual Juri&s;diction. But it is needle&s;s to prove what the Enemies of Epi&s;copacy will not deny, that wherever this Form of Govern|ment has obtained, the Government of the Church has always been exerci&s;ed by Bi&s;hops, and never by Pre&s;byters, unle&s;s in an inferior Degree and in Subordination to them.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="010578_0017_0F86F0880CC35580">Another Power belonging to Bi&s;hops, is that of <HI>Ordination</HI>; which has always been con&s;idered by the Friends of Epi&s;copacy as peculiar to Bi&s;hops, and unalienable from their Office. And indeed there would be an Ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing the con|trary. For to whom can the Appointment of inferior and &s;ubordinate Officers belong, in every Society, but to tho&s;e who govern it? Be&s;ides, the &s;ame Arguments which prove the Di&s;tinction of Bi&s;hops from Pre&s;byters, prove al&s;o that Ordi|nation is an Office peculiar to the former; for it is chiefly by the Appropriation of Offices, that we are able to prove the Di&s;tinction of Orders. Be|cau&s;e &s;ome Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offices are never per|formed by the Clergy in common, but only by &s;uch of them as are particularly ordained for tho&s;e Purpo&s;es, it is evident that tho&s;e who are thus or|dained and impowered&punc; are admitted to a different and higher Order. Now, with Regard to the Power of Ordination, none that have laboured in the Cau&s;e have ever been able to &s;hew from Scrip|ture a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> In&s;tance, wherein this Power has been exerci&s;ed by Pre&s;byters <HI>only</HI>; but there are <HI>many</HI> In&s;tances in which tho&s;e, who are manife&s;tly &s;upe|rior to Pre&s;byters, are found to have u&s;ed it.</P>
<P>As to the Ca&s;e of <HI>Timothy,</HI> whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> ex|horts, in his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Epi&s;tle to him, to
<Q>neglect not the Gift which was given him by Prophecy, <HI>with</HI> the laying on the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery,</Q>
it will not an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e. For allowing, at pre&s;ent, the Word <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> to &s;ignify, what &s;ome would choo&s;e it &s;hould &s;ignify, a Number of meer <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI>; yet we are certain that <HI>Timothy</HI> was not ordained by &s;uch Per&s;ons only, unle&s;s St. <HI>Paul</HI> was but a meer Pre&s;byter. For in his <HI>&s;econd</HI> Epi&s;tle to him he expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts, that this &s;ame Gift was
<PB N="17" REF="010578_0017_0F86F0880CC35580">
imparted to him
<Q><HI>by</HI> the laying on of his own Hands.</Q></P>
<P>The Que&s;tion then ari&s;es, How the&s;e two Ac|counts of <HI>Timothy's</HI> Ordination can be reconciled? To this Que&s;tion the An&s;wer is obvious. There is not a Pre&s;byter of the Church of England but can, with Truth and Propriety &s;ay, that he re|ceived his Ordination <HI>by</HI> the laying on of the Hands of the Bi&s;hop, and <HI>with</HI> the laying on of the Hands of Pre&s;byters. For in <HI>our</HI> Ordinations, in which, as in other Things, we endeavour to come as near as po&s;&s;ible to the primitive Standard, the Pre&s;byters that are pre&s;ent, always join with the Bi&s;hop in the Impo&s;ition of Hands. But ob|&s;erve the Difference between <HI>by</HI> and <HI>with: Timo|thy</HI> received his Gift <HI>by</HI> the Impo&s;ition of St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Hands, as being effectual to convey it; but it was only <HI>with</HI> the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery&punc; which implies not any Power in them, but their Concurrence only. St. <HI>Paul</HI> could have ordained without their Concurrence, but the Im|po&s;ition of their Hands would have been altoge|ther unavailable without the Apo&s;tle&mdash;much more in Oppo&s;ition to him. I am a&s;hamed to repeat Things which have been &s;o frequently &s;aid by others; but an Apprehen&s;ion that the&s;e Papers may fall into the Hands of &s;ome, who are Stran|gers to what has been written on the Subject, mu&s;t be my Apology.</P>
<P>As to the other Ca&s;e of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> which is objected again&s;t us, there is no Evidence that this was any Ordination at all; and when it can be proved that it was, it will be &s;oon enough to con&s;ider it.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that there is no In&s;tance in Holy Scripture, wherein Ordination has been performed
<PB N="18" REF="010578_0018_0F86F088CEE05980">
by meer Pre&s;byters: I may go on and &s;ay, that there is not an In&s;tance of it to be found in the Church for &s;everal Ages. <HI>Aerius</HI> and <HI>Colluthus</HI> in the Fourth Century, &s;eem to have been the fir&s;t Contrivers of Ordinations of this Sort; but, with what Views they acted&mdash;in what Light they were con&s;idered by the Catholic Church&mdash;and how badly they &s;ucceeded&mdash;are Particulars, for which I beg Leave to refer the Engli&s;h Reader to <HI>Hooker's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book vii.

<P>From this Time, until after the Beginning of the Reformation in the <HI>Sixteenth Century,</HI> no In|&s;tances worthy of Notice occur to favour Ordina|tion by Pre&s;byters. So that the uniform Practice of the Church for 1500 Years, may be added to the Evidence of Scripture, in Support of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Epi&s;copal Ordination.</P>
<P>There is another Branch of the Epi&s;copal Office, which mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over on this Occa&s;ion, as we think it a very material one; I mean the Impo&s;ition of Hands in <HI>Confirmation.</HI> The Nature and De&s;ign of Confirmation may be &s;een in our public Office for the Admini&s;tration of it&mdash;wherein the Per&s;ons to be confirmed are, in a public Man|ner, pre&s;ented to the Bi&s;hop, who a&s;ks them with due Solemnity,
<Q>Do ye here in the Pre&s;ence of God, and of this Congregation, <HI>renew</HI> the &s;olemn Promi&s;e and Vow that was made in your Name at your Bapti&s;m; ratifying and confirming the &s;ame <HI>in your own Per&s;ons,</HI> and acknowledging your&s;elves bound to believe, and to do all tho&s;e Things which your God-fathers and God-mo|thers then undertook for you?</Q>

each Per&s;on an&s;wers in the Affirmative, "I do." Then follows the Impo&s;ition of the Bi&s;hop's Hands, with Benediction and Prayer.</P>
<P>We &s;ee here, that Confirmation con&s;i&s;ts of two Parts; one to be performed by the Bi&s;hop, and the other by the Per&s;ons pre&s;ented to him. The Per&s;ons pre&s;ented, on their Parts, &s;olemnly, in the Pre&s;ence of God and the Congregation, renew the Promi&s;es made, not by them&s;elves, but by others in their Name, at their Bapti&s;m, and ratify and confirm the &s;ame in their own Per&s;ons; in Con&s;e|quence of which, the Bi&s;hop for his Part, impo&s;es his Hands upon them with Prayer, and ble&s;&s;es them.</P>
<P>As to that Part of the Tran&s;action which be|longs to the Per&s;ons confirmed, none can di&s;pute the Propriety or U&s;efulne&s;s of it. For nothing can be better adapted for the Promotion of Virtue and Piety, than that tho&s;e who have been baptized in their Infancy, as &s;oon as they are duly in&s;tructed in the Nature of the bapti&s;mal Covenant, &s;hould thus publickly engage, in their own Per&s;ons, to perform the Conditions of it. And as to the Bi&s;hop's Part, for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons that we expect the Ble&s;&s;ing of God to attend any mini&s;terial Offices in the Chri&s;tian Church, it may be expected in this; which is founded on the Example and Au|thority of Scripture, as well as on the unvaried Practice of the primitive Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The Church of England declares, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Can. lx.</NOTE> that
<Q>it hath been a &s;olemn, ancient and laudable Cu&s;tom, continued from the Apo&s;tles Time, that all Bi&s;hops &s;hould lay their Hands upon Children, baptized and in&s;tructed in the Cate|chi&s;m
<PB N="20" REF="010578_0019_0F86F08998109948">
of the Chri&s;tian Religion, praying over them and ble&s;&s;ing them.</Q>
If this Cu&s;tom has been continued <HI>from</HI> the Apo&s;tles Time, it mu&s;t have been practi&s;ed <HI>in</HI> their Time; for, in the Language of the Schools, the <HI>Terminus a quo</HI> is the Time of the Apo&s;tles. And it can with no Pro|priety be &s;aid to have been continued <HI>from</HI> their Time, if it commenced <HI>after</HI> it. Let us &s;ee then what Information the Scripture gives us, relating to this Subject.</P>
<P>In <HI>the Acts of the Apo&s;tles</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. viii.14, 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> we have the follow|ing Pa&s;&s;age:
<Q>When the Apo&s;tles that were at Jeru&s;alem heard that Samaria had received the Word of God, they &s;ent unto them Peter and John; who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Gho&s;t. For as yet he was fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us. Then laid they their Hands on them, and they received the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q>
The&s;e Words exactly de&s;cribe Confirmation, as it is practiced in the Church of England, and there is hardly Room for a Po&s;&s;ibility of applying them to any Thing el&s;e. Two Apo&s;tles are &s;ent to Sa|maria, to perform a particular Office&mdash;had it not been nece&s;&s;ary that this Office &s;hould be performed by tho&s;e of the highe&s;t Order in the Church, others undoubtedly would have been employed in that Service; it being ab&s;urd to imagine, that Apo&s;tles would have been &s;ent from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Samaria</HI> to do that only, which might as effectually have been done by common Elders&mdash;the Office it&s;elf was to impo&s;e Hands on tho&s;e that had received Bapti&s;m&mdash;and the great End of it was, that, by
<PB N="21" REF="010578_0019_0F86F08998109948">
this Impo&s;ition of Hands, the Subjects of it might receive the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>We have another In&s;tance of Confirmation in the Di&s;ciples at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> on whom,
<Q>after they were baptized, St. <HI>Paul</HI> laid his Hands, and the Holy Gho&s;t came upon them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xix.</NOTE>.</Q>
There can be no Rea&s;on to doubt but the Office here performed to the Converts at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> was the very &s;ame that was performed to tho&s;e in <HI>Samaria</HI>; &s;ince it was admini&s;tered, in the &s;ame Manner&mdash;by a Per&s;on of the &s;ame highe&s;t Order in the Church&mdash;to tho&s;e that had the &s;ame Qualifications&mdash;and was atten|ded with the &s;ame Effects.</P>
<P>Should it be objected, that the&s;e In&s;tances prove only what was occa&s;ionally practiced by the Apo|&s;tles, but not that this Rite was intended to be of &s;tanding U&s;e to the Church in all Ages, I an|&s;wer: What was the Intention of the Apo&s;tles, was be&s;t known by their Contemporaries who con|ver&s;ed with them; and what <HI>their</HI> Opinion was of this Matter, we may &s;afely judge from their Practice. That Confirmation was al&s;o practi&s;ed by the immediate Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles, and has been univer&s;ally continued through all the Ages of the Church, until within this Two Centuries, he that has the lea&s;t Acquaintance with Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory mu&s;t confe&s;s. Had there been any Doubts or Di&s;putes, about the U&s;efulne&s;s or Propriety of its Continuance, in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity, we might have &s;ome Rea&s;on to di&s;pute it now. But &s;o far was this from being the Ca&s;e, that it was univer&s;ally received as of &s;acred Obligation, and of great Importance.</P>
<P><Q>Can you be ignorant (&s;ays St. <HI>Jerom</HI>) that this is the common Cu&s;tom of Churches, that
<PB N="22" REF="010578_0020_0F86F08BF8883E88">
Hands are laid upon tho&s;e who have received Bapti&s;m, and in that Manner the Holy Gho&s;t is implored? Do you a&s;k, where this is writ|ten? you will find it in <HI>the Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI> But even if the Authority of Scripture had been wanting, the Con&s;ent of the <HI>whole World</HI> in this Matter, would have the Force of a Com|mand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ni&s;cis etiam Eccle&s;iarum hunc e&s;&s;e Morem, ut baptizatis po&s;tea Manus imponantur, et ita invocetur Spiritus Sanctus.

<HI>Who&s;e</HI> Hands were impo&s;ed in &s;uch Ca&s;es, we are plainly told, &s;oon after.
<Q>The general Cu&s;tom is this, that the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> goes abroad to impo&s;e Hands upon tho&s;e, who, in the &s;maller Cities, and at a Di&s;tance, have been baptized by Pre&s;byters and Deacons, that he may obtain for them by Prayer the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Non quidam abnuo hanc Eccle&s;iarum e&s;&s;e Con&s;uetudinem, ut ad eos qui longe in minoribus Urbibus per Pre&s;byteros et Diaconos baptizati &s;unt, <HI>Epi&s;copus</HI> ad Invocationem &s;ancti Spiritus Manum impo&s;iturus excurrat. <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But that it was the Intention of the Apo&s;tles, that Confirmation &s;hould not expire with them, but be continued for the perpetual Benefit of the Church, we are not only able to prove thus medi|ately, but it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, from what one of them has <HI>&s;aid</HI> concerning it. The Author of the Epi&s;tle to the Hebrews <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. vi.1, 2.</NOTE> &s;peaks of it, as one of the fir&s;t Principles of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine, and fundamental to it; and puts it upon the &s;ame Footing, in that Re&s;pect, with Repentance, Faith, &amp;c.
<Q>Leaving the <HI>Principles</HI> of the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, let us go on to Perfection; not laying again the <HI>Foundation</HI> of Repentance from dead

Works, and of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of Bapti&s;ms, and of <HI>the laying on of Hands,</HI> and of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, and of eternal Judgment.</Q>
What we are to under|&s;tand by <HI>the laying on of Hands,</HI> &s;ub&s;equent to Bap|ti&s;m, tho&s;e who reject the Doctrine of Confirmation may probably di&s;pute. But all the ancient Com|mentators agreed in Opinion, in which they have had the Concurrence of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Moderns, that what is here meant, is the Im|po&s;ition of Hands in Confirmation only. If there|fore, the Principles of Chri&s;tianity are the &s;ame now as they were originally, Confirmation, which, in the above Pa&s;&s;age is declared to be one of them, ought always to be retained in the Church.</P>
<P>But it may be farther objected, that from the In&s;tances of Confirmation recorded in Scripture, the Effects of it appear to have been miraculous, and con&s;equently, as the Power of Miracles has confe&s;&s;edly long cea&s;ed, that this Rite whereby it was imparted, is now u&s;ele&s;s, and ought not to be continued. But the Solution of this Objection is not difficult. There is no Rea&s;on to believe, that miraculous Gifts, although frequently, were always imparted by the Impo&s;ition of the Apo&s;tles Hands. But could this be proved, yet other Gifts of a dif|ferent Nature were al&s;o communicated at the &s;ame Time; and this Communication is nece&s;&s;ary to all Per&s;ons in all Ages. Without the gracious A&s;|&s;i&s;tances of the Holy Spirit, it is as certain now as it ever was, that no Man is able to with&s;tand Temptations, and to fulfil the Conditions of the Go&s;pel Covenant.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e upon whom the Apo&s;tles laid Hands, are &s;aid to have received the Holy Gho&s;t: but, I tru&s;t, there is nothing &s;o extraordinary in this, but that
<PB N="24" REF="010578_0021_0F86F08D425463C8">
Chri&s;tians in all Ages, who have a proper Di&s;po|&s;ition, and make U&s;e of the &s;tanding Means ap|pointed in the Church, may hope to obtain even this un&s;peakable Benefit. And if &s;ome, in Con|&s;equence of this Impo&s;ition of the Apo&s;tles Hands, are &s;aid to have &s;poken with Tongues, and prophe|&s;ied, which was not &s;o much for their own per&s;onal Advantage, as for the Conviction of others; it is &s;ufficient for Chri&s;tians at this Day, that, without the&s;e miraculous Endowments, after
<Q>the For|givene&s;s of their Sins,</Q>
they are
<Q>&s;trengthened with the Holy Gho&s;t the Comforter,</Q>
and that
<Q>the manifold Gifts of Grace are daily increa&s;ed in them&mdash;that they receive the Spirit of Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding&mdash;the Spirit of Coun&s;el and gho&s;tly Strength&mdash;and are filled with the Spirit of the Fear of God;</Q>
for all which Things the Bi&s;hop and Congregation are directed to pray, in the Office of Confirmation.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee upon what Authority this Practice is founded, and the Advantages that attend it; and if Per&s;ons in this Age are di&s;affected, or in|different towards it, it is either becau&s;e they do not under&s;tand the Nature of it, or have not that Zeal and Anxiety for their &s;piritual Intere&s;ts, which Men had formerly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The holy Rite of Confirmation is a divine Ordinance, and it produces divine Effects, and is mini&s;tered by divine Per&s;ons, that is, by tho&s;e whom God hath &s;anctified and &s;eparated to this Mini&s;tration.

<HEAD>SECTION III. That the Church in America, without an Epi&s;copate, is nece&s;&s;arily de&s;titute of a regular Government, and cannot enjoy the Benefits of Ordination and Confirmation.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. III.</NOTE>IN the preceeding Sections I have endeavoured to give a <HI>Summary</HI> of the Arguments in Favour of Epi&s;copacy, and to prove, with all po&s;&s;ible Brevity, that the Powers of ordaining, confirming and governing the Church, belong rightfully to Bi&s;hops, and are not to be exerci&s;ed by any of an inferior Order.</P>
<P>If the Con&s;iderations which have been offered have no Weight with others, they are, however, convincing to us of the Church of England; and we firmly believe the Truth and Importance of the &s;everal Points, the Proof of which has been thus briefly attempted. Indeed the Conviction of Di&s;&s;enters, with Regard to the Divine In&s;titution and Authority of Epi&s;copacy, is not the imme|diate Intention of this Publication: and yet it is no Mark of an unfriendly Di&s;po&s;ition, to hope, that tho&s;e who are unable to invalidate the Force of the preceeding Arguments, will candidly &s;ub|mit to them, unle&s;s they are able to oppo&s;e to them others which they judge to be, at lea&s;t, of equal Strength. For it is the Duty of every rational Inquirer, in all Ca&s;es, and more e&s;pecially in Matters of Religion, to be governed by what appears to be the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence.

Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance of Epi&s;copacy, <HI>in the Opinion of Epi&s;copalians,</HI> and to &s;hew the wretched Condition of the Church of England in America for Want of Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>And this appears, in Part, from what has been already offered. For if, according to the Doctrine and Belief of the Church of England, none have a Right to govern the Church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reader will ob&s;erve, that only &s;uch Authority is here &s;poken of, as is purely Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and peculiar to the Officers of the Church.

<P>Was there no other Di&s;advantage attending our Want of Bi&s;hops, than that it nece&s;&s;arily prevents our having Confirmation admini&s;tered, we &s;hould e&s;teem it a great Grievance. For in Proportion to our Opinion of the U&s;efulne&s;s of this &s;acred In&s;titution, mu&s;t be the Hard&s;hip of being ex|cluded from the Enjoyment of it&mdash;e&s;pecially, when it is con&s;idered that our Enjoyment of it would not interfere with either the civil or reli|gious Rights or Privileges of any. I will not, however, enlarge on this Subject, but proceed immediately to Matters of greater Con&s;equence; and &s;uch are the Church's Want of Government and ordaining Powers.</P>
<P>When it is &s;aid, that the Church of England in America, without Bi&s;hops, mu&s;t be without Go|vernment, this is to be under&s;tood in a qualified Sen&s;e. For where there is ab&s;olutely no Govern|ment at all, there can be nothing but Di&s;order and
<PB N="28" REF="010578_0023_0F86F08E127386A8">
Confu&s;ion, without any Appearance of Regu|larity; which, I tru&s;t, is not yet the Ca&s;e of the Church in America. Some Degree of Govern|ment is e&s;&s;ential to the very Being of every So|ciety, whether civil or religious; and as &s;oon as Government intirely cea&s;es, the Society is di&s;&s;ol|ved and has no Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>It has been allowed that Pre&s;byters may have a &s;ubordinate Authority to govern; and it is well known, that the <HI>Bi&s;hop of London</HI> hath formerly taken &s;ome Cognizance of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters in the Plantations, by Virtue of the King's Com|mi&s;&s;ion. But much more than this is needful, to an&s;wer the Nece&s;&s;ities of the American Church. The Clergy can evidently do but little <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The mo&s;t that the Clergy can do to relieve the Church, in the pre&s;ent State of Things, &s;eems to be in the Way of <HI>voluntary Conventions,</HI> which has been regularly practi&s;ed, for a Number of Years, in &s;ome of the Northern Colonies. A general Concern for the Intere&s;t of Religion and the Church, and a De&s;ire in the Clergy of contributing their united Endeavours to promote it, occa&s;ioned the fir&s;t Ri&s;e of the&s;e Conventions; and the Advan|tages which have been found, on the Whole, to attend them, have cau&s;ed their Continuance.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;uch Conventions of the Clergy, wherein all the Mem|bers meet together on Terms of Equality, are unknown to the Con&s;titution of the Church of England. But it mu&s;t be al&s;o granted, that for &s;uch a Number of Pre&s;byters, to be left without a Bi&s;hop at their Head to &s;uperintend and govern them, is a Thing equally unknown to the Con&s;titution of any Epi&s;copal Church upon Earth. That, of the Church of England in her Colonies, is an extraordinary Ca&s;e: and in extraordinary Ca&s;es uncommon Mea&s;ures may be allowable. If &s;ome Inconveniences may be expected from the&s;e Conventions, which hitherto have been but &s;mall and incon&s;iderable; Inconveniences al&s;o will ari&s;e, from every other Method that can be taken by the Clergy to &s;erve the general Intere&s;t of Religion, while without an Epi&s;copate&mdash; and undoubtedly the greate&s;t Inconveniences of all, from their neglecting to exert them&s;elves <HI>jointly</HI> in the Pro&s;ecution of their general Duty. If tho&s;e who think unfavourably of our Conven|tions, would be &s;o obliging as to tell us, <HI>how,</HI> in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of the Church, we can &s;erve it, and thereby the common Cau&s;e of Religion more effectually, we &s;hould take it kindly. This is the great End we aim at; and we are attached to parti|cular Means, only in Proportion as we judge them to be con|ducive thereto.</P></NOTE> without a Bi&s;hop; and when it is di&s;puted, whether <HI>one</HI>
Bi&s;hop re&s;iding in America would be &s;ufficient for the Colonies, it is agreed, on all Sides, that pro|per Care cannot be taken of them by a Bi&s;hop,
<PB N="29" REF="010578_0023_0F86F08E127386A8">
who has the immediate In&s;pection of a large Dio|ce&s;s in England, and re&s;ides at the Di&s;tance of Three Thou&s;and Miles. Trial has been heretofore made what could be done by Commi&s;&s;aries; but their U&s;efulne&s;s, upon the Whole, appeared to be &s;o incon&s;iderable, that none have been appointed for near Twenty Years.</P>
<P>So that the State of the Church in America is, at pre&s;ent, really this: The Clergy are indepen|dent of each other, and have no Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Superiors to unite or control them; and the Peo|ple are &s;en&s;ible of their Want of Power, and find them&s;elves free from all Re&s;traints of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority. They both con&s;ider them&s;elves as ac|countable to God for their religious Behaviour, and, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, to the World for the Con|&s;i&s;tency of their Characters. They have the <HI>Rubrics</HI> of the Church of England, whereby they profe&s;s to govern them&s;elves, and to which, for the mo&s;t Part, they &s;trictly adhere, in the public Offices of Religion; and they endeavour to conform to the <HI>Canons,</HI> &s;o far as the Circum&s;tances of the Church in this Country will admit of. But after all, Men's governing them&s;elves by certain Rules and Laws, (if the Expre&s;&s;ion may be allowed of) and their being governed by others, who have a proper Authority, although according to the &s;ame Laws, are Things that will ever be found to be different. In the former Ca&s;e, &s;ome Appearance of Order may be maintained, but the Body is
<PB N="30" REF="010578_0024_0F86F08F5DA0F9E8">
without Strength, and liable to be de&s;troyed by innumerable Accidents; whereas it is only in the latter Ca&s;e, that Health and Vigour and Perma|nency can be rea&s;onably expected.</P>
<P>The Government of the Church may be na|turally divided into Two Branches, and con&s;idered as relating either to the Clergy, or the Laity; and it may be proper to take a &s;hort View of it, with Reference to both. Religion being a Matter of free Choice, for which we are ordinarily ac|countable only to him, who will hereafter judge us for our moral Behaviour&mdash;and the Church, con&s;idered with Relation to civil Power, being in the very Nature of it a voluntary Society; it is left to Men's Con&s;ciences, whether they will be|come Members of it or not. But after they are become Members, the Laws of the Church are in Force again&s;t them, and they are &s;ubject, in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters, to the Authority of tho&s;e who govern it.</P>
<P>What the ju&s;t Penalties of Di&s;obedience are, we mu&s;t learn from the Nature of the Church it|&s;elf. In Civil Society, the Magi&s;trate is armed with the Sword of Ju&s;tice, and
<Q>he is the Mini|&s;ter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth Evil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii.4.</NOTE>,</Q>
according to the De|gree and Nature of his Offences. But the Power of the Church is of a &s;piritual Nature, and the utmo&s;t Effect of it in this World, is the cutting off and rejecting tho&s;e Members which are in|curably and dangerou&s;ly corrupted. This Puni&s;h|ment which has commonly been known by the Name of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> however it was dreaded in the pure&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity, has lo&s;t much
<PB N="31" REF="010578_0024_0F86F08F5DA0F9E8">
of its Force in this; wherein Altars are &s;et up again&s;t Altars, and Churches again&s;t Churches, and tho&s;e who are rejected by one, may be received by another. A Di&s;po&s;ition to &s;light the highe&s;t Puni&s;hment which the Church can inflict has become general, and there appears to be no Remedy for it, unle&s;s in the U&s;e of Rea&s;on and Per&s;ua&s;ion. But we live in an Age, in which the Voice of Rea&s;on will not be heard, nor the Strength of Arguments regarded, although &s;up|ported by the Declarations of Heaven, on the Subject of Church Di&s;cipline. Nay, a Man would be generally e&s;teemed to be either wrong-headed, or mean-&s;pirited, or both, who &s;hould profe&s;s much Reverence for Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority; and the Charge of <HI>Prie&s;t-Craft,</HI> &s;o long hackneyed by Infidels and Libertines, would be &s;ure to fall upon the Clergy, &s;hould they have Courage to &s;peak up in Defence of it.</P>
<P>In this State of Things, the Re&s;toration of the primitive Di&s;cipline &s;eems to be a Matter rather to be wi&s;hed for and de&s;ired, than to be rationally attempted by tho&s;e in Authority. Accordingly no Attempts of this Nature will be made under in American Epi&s;copate; the Di&s;cipline of the Church, &s;o far as it relates to the private Mem|bers, will be left as it is, and nothing farther will be done than refu&s;ing the Communion to di&s;or|derly and &s;candalous Per&s;ons, which every Clergy|man may now refu&s;e, and ought to refu&s;e, agree|ably to the <HI>Rubrics.</HI></P>
<P>But with Regard to the Clergy, it is propo&s;ed that a &s;trict Di&s;cipline be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that the Bi&s;hop's Power over them &s;hall be as full and complete, as the Laws and Canons of the Church direct. Of the Nece&s;&s;ity of this, none can be
<PB N="32" REF="010578_0025_0F86F08F8A083108">
more &s;en&s;ible than the Clergy them&s;elves, who, in all their Addre&s;&s;es in Favour of an Epi&s;copate, have propo&s;ed and reque&s;ted that this may be the Ca&s;e. The general Character of the American Clergy, the Author believes, if he may judge from a large and exten&s;ive Acquaintance with them, and he hopes it may be thought excu&s;able in him, on this Occa&s;ion, although one of the Number, to declare his Belief of it, to be truly re&s;pectable. They are &s;ound and &s;teady in their Principles, and regular in their Behaviour. In &s;o large a Body, &s;ome Exceptions from the general Character mu&s;t be expected; but it is rather to be wondered that their Number is &s;o &s;mall, con&s;idering all Things.</P>
<P>Indeed we have heard much of the profligate Behaviour of the Clergy to the Southward, and in the I&s;lands; but this, perhaps, may have been owing to the Conduct of a few Individuals, re|ported and aggravated with a malicious Intention. But allowing many of the&s;e evil Reports to have been ju&s;tly founded, yet we all know that the im|moral Practices of one vicious Clergyman will be more frequently mentioned, than the Virtues of Fifty, of an orderly Life and Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But after all, whatever may be the Proportion between the virtuous and vicious Clergymen in America, as there are undoubtedly &s;ome of both Characters; the Want of Bi&s;hops to &s;uperintend and govern them, is obvious at fir&s;t View. If one Sort have no Need of a Bi&s;hop to keep them to their Duty, yet &s;ome Ca&s;es will ari&s;e in the Di&s;|charge of it in which his Direction will be u&s;eful &mdash;and many Ca&s;es, wherein his Support and En|couragement will be needful&mdash;and in all Ca&s;es, his Friend&s;hip and Patronage will give Life and
<PB N="33" REF="010578_0025_0F86F08F8A083108">
Spirit to them in undergoing the Difficulties, and in performing the Duties, of their Station.</P>
<P>But as there are Clergymen al&s;o of a different Character, it is more immediately nece&s;&s;ary on Account of the&s;e, that Epi&s;copal Government &s;hould take Place in America. The Proce&s;s of carrying an Accu&s;ation, and afterwards of &s;uppor|ting it, before our Superiors, at &s;o great a Di&s;tance, mu&s;t be tedious and difficult; and this Con&s;ide|ration undoubtedly, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, may cau&s;e tho&s;e to e&s;cape Puni&s;hment who really de&s;erve it. But the Ca&s;e will be different under a &s;ettled Epi&s;|copate; as then, for every Grievance of this Nature, the Church will have an ea&s;y and effec|tual Remedy. If a Clergyman &s;hall di&s;grace his Profe&s;&s;ion in an open and &s;candalous Manner, a Bi&s;hop re&s;iding in the Country can &s;u&s;pend him immediately; and if upon Trial the Ca&s;e &s;hall be found to de&s;erve it, he can proceed to deprive him of his Benefice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid that in <HI>Maryland,</HI> a Clergyman once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Living, can hold it for Life, however loo&s;e and profligate he may prove in his Behaviour. If this is really the Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be owing to &s;ome great Defect in the Con&s;titution of that Province, which ought to be remedied. In the mean while, it is &s;uch a Hard&s;hip upon the Church, as, I believe, is &s;uffered in no other Part of the World. And what makes it the more intolerable, is, that the &s;ole Right of di&s;po&s;ing of every Benefice in the Province, is claimed by the Proprietor, and exerci&s;ed by his Governor. It is &s;ome Alleviation however, that the pre&s;ent very worthy Gover|nor makes it a general Rule, (if the Author hath been rightly in|formed) to which he adheres, as far as he can, con&s;i&s;tently with his Obligations to the Proprietor, to grant Induction to no Clergyman, without the Approbation of the Ve&s;try and principal Pari&s;hioners.</NOTE>, and not only &s;ilence and depo&s;e him, but excommunicate him from the Society of Chri&s;tians. The Con&s;ideration of this, and that they are under the Eye of their Bi&s;hop, one main Branch of who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is to in&s;pect and enquire
<PB N="34" REF="010578_0026_0F86F092A53135B0">
into their Conduct, will naturally tend to make the Clergy in general, more regular and diligent in the Di&s;charge of the Duties of their Office, and more careful and circum&s;pect in their whole Beha|viour. In a Word, of tho&s;e who&s;e Characters are ju&s;tly exceptionable, &s;ome may probably be re|formed by a Bi&s;hop; and as to others, they may be ea&s;ily di&s;placed, unle&s;s it be the Fault of the People them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But a greater Di&s;advantage, if po&s;&s;ible, than the Want of a regular Government, attends the Church of England in America in its pre&s;ent State, I mean the Want of Ordination: for none can be ad|mitted to Holy Orders without cro&s;&s;ing the Atlan|tic, with great Hazard and Expence. The Dan|ger of &s;uch a Voyage may, to &s;ome, appear to be trifling; but the Apprehen&s;ion of it, together with a natural Aver&s;ion to the Sea, has been known to deter many worthy Per&s;ons, who have been de|&s;irous of obtaining Ordination in the Church, from attempting it&mdash;the Fear and Apprehen&s;ion of Danger, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, whether rightly founded or not, having always the &s;ame Effect. But what real Foundation there is for &s;uch an Apprehen&s;ion, will be be&s;t di&s;covered from Experience and Facts. Now the exact Number of tho&s;e that have gone Home for Ordination, from the&s;e Northern Co|lonies (excepting &s;ome who have &s;ailed lately, who cannot properly be included in this Account) is Fifty-two. Of the&s;e Forty-two have returned &s;afely, and Ten have mi&s;carried; the Voyage, or Sickne&s;s occa&s;ioned by it, having proved fatal to near a fifth Part of them.</P>
<P>The Expence of this Voyage cannot be reckoned at le&s;s, upon an Average, than One Hundred Pounds Sterling to each Per&s;on. To Men of For|tune
<PB N="35" REF="010578_0026_0F86F092A53135B0" MS="y">
this is an incon&s;iderable Sum; but Men of Fortune mu&s;t not be expected to devote them|&s;elves to the Service of the Church in America, where the Pro&s;pect is &s;o di&s;couraging, and &s;o many di&s;agreeable Circum&s;tances are known to attend it. The Expence mu&s;t therefore generally fall upon &s;uch, as having already expended the greate&s;t Part of their Pittance in their Education, will find it extremely hard to rai&s;e a Sum &s;ufficient for the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e Di&s;couragements, there has al|ways been great Difficulty in &s;upplying the Church with Clergymen, and there always mu&s;t be. In what Manner the Church is &s;upplied at pre&s;ent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">February 1767.</NOTE>, the following In&s;tances will &s;ufficiently te&s;tify. In the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> there are Twenty-one Churches and Congregations; Eleven of the&s;e are intirely de&s;titute of a Mini&s;ter, and there are but Five Clergymen to do the Duties of the other Ten. In <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> including the <HI>Lower Coun|ties,</HI> the Ca&s;e is &s;imilar. In the City of <HI>Philadel|phia</HI> there are Three Churches and Congregations, and but Two Clergymen; in the Re&s;t of the Pro|vince the Number of Churches is Twenty-&s;ix, and that of the Clergy is but Seven.</P>
<P>If &s;ome of the Colonies are better &s;upplied, perhaps others may be found which are provided for not &s;o well. In <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> the late Go|vernor <HI>Dobbs</HI> informed <HI>the Society,</HI> in his Letter dated March 29th, 1764,
<Q>that there were then but Six Clergymen in that Province, although there were Twenty-nine Pari&s;hes, and each Pari&s;h contained a whole County:</Q>
And the Majority of the Inhabitants are &s;aid to profe&s;s
<PB N="36" REF="010578_0027_0F86F093D9104E38" MS="y">
them&s;elves Members of the Church. Other Rea|&s;ons may have contributed to this general Want of Clergymen in America, but it has always been principally owing to the great Difficulty of ob|taining Ordination.</P>
<P>Under this Head it may be ob&s;erved farther, that the Danger and Expence of a Voyage to Eng|land for the Purpo&s;e of obtaining Ordination, are not the only Evils we have Rea&s;on to complain of: for another glaring Di&s;advantage, to which the Church in America is manife&s;tly &s;ubject, ari&s;es from the impo&s;&s;ibility that a Bi&s;hop re&s;iding in England, &s;hould be &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Characters of tho&s;e who go Home from this Country for Holy Orders. To this it is owing, that Ordination has been &s;ometimes fraudulently and &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtained by &s;uch Wretches, as are not only a Scandal to the Church, but a Di&s;|grace to the human Species.</P>
<P>The Church has taken all due Care that none &s;hall be ordained, without full and proper Evi|dence of their <HI>good Character</HI> and Abilities <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Canon xxxiv.</NOTE>; and as to tho&s;e who go Home from this di&s;tant Country for that Purpo&s;e, &s;en&s;ible of the peculiar Hazard attending &s;uch Ca&s;es, the <HI>Bi&s;hop of London,</HI> in Conjunction with <HI>the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign Parts,</HI> every Year proclaims and publi&s;hes to the World, that he
<Q>reque&s;ts and earne&s;tly&punc; be&s;eeches all Per&s;ons concerned, that they recommend no Man out of Favour or Af|fection, or any other worldly Con&s;ideration, but with a &s;incere Regard to the Honour of Al|mighty God, and our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour; as they tender the Intere&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the Good of Men's Souls.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="010578_0027_0F86F093D9104E38" MS="y">But although the Bi&s;hops of London, to whom this Application from America has always been made, have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively exerci&s;ed the greate&s;t Care and Circum&s;pection in this Matter, yet none of them have been able intirely to avoid Impo&s;i|tions of this Nature. Notwith&s;tanding their ut|mo&s;t Caution and Care to prevent it, In&s;tances have happened, wherein Per&s;ons have produced in England the mo&s;t ample written Credentials, obtained God knows how, of their pious and or|derly Conver&s;ation, who&s;e Lives have been noto|riou&s;ly infamous in this Country; and after having been inve&s;ted with the &s;acred Office, they have been &s;ent back to take Charge of the Souls of others&mdash;in the Pro&s;ecution of which Work they have acted as if they had not, or imagined that they had not, any Souls of their own.</P>
<P>And this is not much to be wondered at, &s;ince in &s;uch a Country as America, an artful Man may &s;ometimes be able to procure Te&s;timonials in his Favour, &s;igned by a competent Number of &s;uch Clergymen and others, as a Bi&s;hop of London will not know how to object again&s;t. Or, &s;hould this Attempt fail him, he may even <HI>forge</HI> his Te&s;ti|monials, and &s;o carry his Point before he is de|tected.

<P>And when we con&s;ider the mi&s;erable Con&s;e|quences that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, even from a &s;ingle In&s;tance of this Kind, and that <HI>one worth|le&s;s</HI>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The unparalleled Hard&s;hip of this Ca&s;e repre&s;ented.</HEAD>
<P>WAS the Author di&s;po&s;ed to proceed in the Way of Declamation, he is of Opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. IV.</NOTE> that the Chri&s;tian Church has not, in any In&s;tance, for Ages pa&s;t, afforded a more fruitful Subject for it. But it is his De&s;ign only to &s;tate Arguments and Facts as briefly as he can, and to recommend them to the candid Con&s;ideration of the Public. He therefore begs Leave, on the foregoing Repre|&s;entation, barely to make <HI>an Appeal</HI> to the Con|&s;ciences of Men <HI>in Behalf of the Church</HI>&mdash;whether, in Ca&s;e the religious Society whereto they belong, was doomed to undergo &s;uch an Hard&s;hip as the Church of England in America &s;uffers for Want of Ordination, to &s;ay nothing of other In&s;tances, they would not think them&s;elves injured, and com|plain mo&s;t bitterly? If any other Denomination of Chri&s;tians in his Maje&s;ty's American Dominions was not allowed to have a Clergyman, without paying a Fine of One Hundred Pounds Sterling on his Admi&s;&s;ion, and expo&s;ing him, at the &s;ame Time, to &s;ome dangerous Proce&s;s, which had proved fatal to a fifth Part of his Predece&s;&s;ors, would they not e&s;teem it an intolerable Grievance, and a cruel Per&s;ecution? And indeed, would not every di&s;intere&s;ted Per&s;on con&s;ider it in the &s;ame Light? Now, if this would be e&s;teemed Per&s;ecu|tion, in the Ca&s;e of Pre&s;byterians or Congrega|tionali&s;ts, or of any other religious Denomination of People in this Country, why it &s;hould be e&s;teem|ed le&s;s when &s;uffered by the Church of England,

is hard to conceive. We have the &s;ame Feelings, the &s;ame Sen&s;ibility with other Per&s;ons, and are equally affected by any Sufferings.</P>
<P>Some perhaps may di&s;pute the Propriety of the Word, as the great Grievance in Que&s;tion ari&s;es not from any po&s;itive Exertion of Civil Power again&s;t us: but if it be not properly Per&s;ecution, it is &s;omething that is as bad in its natural Con&s;e|quences. It may be que&s;tioned, whether the wor&s;t Per&s;ecutions have ever exterminated a fifth Part of the Clergy in any Country; and it is evident, that all direct Per&s;ecutions have been attended with this good Effect, that the religious Zeal of tho&s;e again&s;t whom they have been intended, has been animated and increa&s;ed: whereas, in the particular Species of &s;uffering, of which the American Church &s;o ju&s;tly complains, there is a peculiar Tendency to render the Members of it carele&s;s and indiffe|rent in religious Matters, and regardle&s;s of its Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>If there are any Points, in which the Rea&s;on and common Sen&s;e of Mankind can be &s;uppo&s;ed to agree, this mu&s;t unque&s;tionably be one, that the Church of England in America, under the before-mentioned Di&s;advantages, although not formally per&s;ecuted, is in a mo&s;t wretched and deplorable Condition. And, we who are Members of it, cannot but think it an Aggravation of our Unhap|pine&s;s, that it appears to be altogether unprece|dented; we being &s;ingled out from all the People upon Earth to be made the fir&s;t Example of it. It would be but a poor Con&s;olation, we confe&s;s, to be able to recollect In&s;tances, wherein others have &s;uffered in the &s;ame Manner with our&s;elves. But yet our Condition &s;eems to imply, and Strangers may conclude from it, that there has been &s;ome|thing

In our petitioning for Bi&s;hops, all that we a&s;k for our&s;elves, is what has been freely granted to others, what has been refu&s;ed to none el&s;e who have applied for it.

That it is &s;o, compared with the State of religious Denominations in the Briti&s;h Domi|nions, has been already &s;hewn. And if we look abroad, or carry our Inquiries back through all the Ages of the Church to its fir&s;t Origin, I am per&s;uaded we &s;hall not be able to find its Parallel.</P>
<P>During the Time of the Apo&s;tles, as the Num|ber of Chri&s;tians increa&s;ed, Care was taken to form them into proper Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;tricts, and a Bi&s;hop was appointed for each,
<Q>to &s;et in Or|der the Things that were wanting, and to ordain Elders in every City<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus i.5.</NOTE>.</Q>
What was the Extent of the&s;e original Di&s;tricts, to which the Exerci&s;e of the Epi&s;copal Authority was ordinarily limited, is, perhaps, not ea&s;y exactly to determine at this Day. But it is mo&s;t probable, that in every large City, including its <HI>Environs</HI> and Dependencies, where the Go&s;pel had been received, and the Num|ber of Chri&s;tian Congregations and Pre&s;byters was con&s;iderable, Bi&s;hops were appointed. And in every Territory, which had natural Boundaries and Limitations, whereby it was made &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from the neighbouring Countries, whether it did or did not include any Capital City, pro|vided, as before, that the Number of Churches required it, a Bi&s;hop was al&s;o &s;ettled. By this Means due Provi&s;ion was made for the whole Church, and no large Number of Chri&s;tians was
<PB N="44" REF="010578_0031_0F86F0964F8E5878">
neglected, nor &s;uffered to continue long without a regular Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government.</P>
<P>An In&s;tance of this general Care is to be found in <HI>Crete</HI> over which <HI>Titus</HI> was appointed Bi&s;hop by St. <HI>Paul</HI>; at a Time, when the Number of Con|verts in that I&s;land, was probably much inferior to the pre&s;ent Number of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, in more than one of our Briti&s;h American I&s;lands. In the &s;ucceeding Ages, until the Roman Empire be|came Chri&s;tian, this Apo&s;tolic Plan was carefully followed, and the Number of Bi&s;hops was in|crea&s;ed, in Proportion to the growing Extent and Advancement of Chri&s;tianity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bingham's Antiquities, <HI>Book ix.</HI></NOTE>. When the Church at length obtained the Protection and Patronage of the State, the&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Regulations were <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law,</HI> and Bi&s;hops, in the Exerci&s;e of their Juri&s;diction, were aided and &s;upported by Civil Power.</P>
<P>If we pur&s;ue the Hi&s;tory of the Church from this Period, we &s;hall meet with no In&s;tance, in which any large Number of People pro&s;elyted to the Chri&s;tian Religion, or any con&s;iderable Colo|nies, &s;ettled by a Chri&s;tian Country, have been without a Bi&s;hop, the Dutch Colonies excepted, which do not de&s;ire them. It has been the Prac|tice of all Chri&s;tian Nations, to provide for and maintain the national Religion, and to render it as re&s;pectable as po&s;&s;ible, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant Colo|nies; wherein, either a Regard for their Religion, or Rea&s;ons of Policy, and probably both, have led them to take equal Care for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as of Civil Government. As to <HI>America,</HI> in particular, wherever we meet with French or Spani&s;h Settlements, we find Bi&s;hops.

In <HI>Canada,</HI> a Country le&s;s populous than many of the Briti&s;h Colonies, when we took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, there was a compleat Eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;h|ment under an Epi&s;copate.</P>
<P>But we need not confine our Inquiries to Chri|&s;tian Nations and Countries. If we con&s;ult the Records of <HI>Pagani&s;m</HI> and <HI>Mahometani&s;m,</HI> the Ca&s;e appears always to have been the &s;ame in this Re|&s;pect. Among the ancient civilized Heathens, the national Religion was never neglected; for it was generally con&s;idered as one of the fir&s;t Duties of the Civil Magi&s;trate, to encourage, &s;upport and increa&s;e its Influence, to the utmo&s;t of his Power. And the Mahometans have ever been as zealous in propagating their Religion, as in extending their Conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>This univer&s;al Practice of all Nations and Ages, has proceeded from Two general Principles that are deeply founded in human Nature, and human Policy. The fir&s;t is in&s;eparable from our Nature, and nece&s;&s;arily leads Men to exert them&s;elves, for the Pre&s;ervation and Security of whatever they e&s;teem and hold to be valuable, in Proportion as they judge of its U&s;efulne&s;s and Importance. The other &s;eems to be a fundamental Principle of &s;ound and con&s;i&s;tent Policy, which nece&s;&s;arily requires the Protection and Security of the national Reli|gion. For as &s;ome Religion has been ever thought, by the wi&s;e&s;t Legi&s;lators, to be nece&s;&s;ary for the Security of Civil Government, and accordingly has always been interwoven into the Con&s;titution of it; &s;o, in every Nation, that Religion which is thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, mu&s;t be looked upon as, in the Opinion of the Legi&s;lature, the be&s;t fitted for this great Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="010578_0032_0F86F097EFC658C0">Wherever therefore the national Religion is not made, in &s;ome Degree, a national Concern, it will commonly be con&s;idered as an Evidence, that tho&s;e who have the Direction of the national Affairs do not e&s;teem their Religion&mdash;or, that they are negli|gent of the Duty they owe to God and the Public, as the Guardians of its Happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned why the Church in America has been thus neglected.</HEAD>
<P>ARE we then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. V.</NOTE> from the pre&s;ent State of the Church of England in America, immedi|ately to form &s;o har&s;h a Conclu&s;ion, concerning tho&s;e who have the Direction of our national Af|fairs? Mu&s;t we nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e, that they have no E&s;teem and Affection for that Religion, which is &s;o clo&s;ely allied and connected with the Con&s;ti|tution of the State? Has the <HI>Conduct</HI> of the Church of England been &s;uch, with Regard to the Go|vernment&mdash;or, are its <HI>Principles</HI> &s;uch, that it is not intitled to the &s;ame Care and Protection, which other Kingdoms and States have ever afforded to the national Religion, whether Chri&s;tian, Maho|metan, or Pagan? Neither of the&s;e, it is hoped, can be &s;aid properly.</P>
<P>Although the Church of England in America appears not hitherto to have been made a national Concern; yet many Rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for this Neglect, owing to the peculiar Circum&s;tances of the Engli&s;h Nation and Colonies, which will account for, although, perhaps, not altogether ex|cu&s;e it. The Colonies were generally &s;ettled by private Adventurers; and &s;ome of them, by tho&s;e who had an Aver&s;ion to Epi&s;copal Government. The Propriety of not &s;ending a Bi&s;hop to Colonies of the latter Sort, will be di&s;puted by none: and as to the others, their Beginnings were &s;mall, and for &s;ome Time an Epi&s;copate was not greatly wanted.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="010578_0033_0F86F09942963B40">Be&s;ides, it ought to be con&s;idered, that the Chan|ges of Government&mdash;the Revolutions of Power&mdash; the Oppo&s;ition of contending Parties at Home&mdash; the Intrigues of foreign Courts&mdash;and the Attacks of neighbouring Kingdoms and States, have gene|rally been more than &s;ufficient to employ the pub|lic Attention, almo&s;t ever &s;ince the Ri&s;e of our Colonies. Accordingly we have found, that even the <HI>commercial</HI> and <HI>political</HI> Importance of the&s;e Colonies, has been but little known or regarded, until of very late Years. In the&s;e Circum&s;tances, it is not to be wondered, that the Ca&s;e of <HI>the Church</HI> in America, has not been attended to; e&s;pecially as the Members of it, not excepting the Clergy, have been carele&s;s them&s;elves, and not made tho&s;e Repre&s;entations in Favour of it, which they ought to have made.</P>
<P>To this may be added, that &s;o long as no re|gular Plan for an American Epi&s;copate was &s;ettled and propo&s;ed, a Fear of infringing the religious Rights of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters in this Country, for which both our Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Rulers have &s;o tender a Regard, mu&s;t have created an al|mo&s;t in&s;uperable Difficulty in carrying into Exe|cution a Work of this Nature.</P>
<P>Our own Negligence in this Country has been confe&s;&s;ed; and I wi&s;h as much could be fairly &s;aid in Excu&s;e for it. How can the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Church here be known, at a Di&s;tance, unle&s;s tho&s;e who re&s;ide here will be at the Trouble of repre&s;en|ting them? And from whom can &s;uch Repre&s;en|tations be properly expected, but from the Clergy, and other Friends and Members of the Church?</P>
<P>Indeed there have not been wanting &s;ome Indi|viduals, for almo&s;t a Century back, who have &s;een

<PB N="55" REF="010578_0036_0F86F09B6936ACA8">
the American Church, and which peculiarly mark the pre&s;ent Period.</P>
<P>It ought to be farther con&s;idered, that the Ar|guments for &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America, were never &s;o urgent and forcible as they are at pre&s;ent. When &s;uch Progre&s;s was made towards obtaining for this Country an Epi&s;copate, in the former Part of this Century, the Number of American Clergy and Profe&s;&s;ors of the Church, although judged then to be greater than in many Dioce&s;&s;es in Eng|land <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note, Page 52.</NOTE>, was &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, in Compari|&s;on with the Amount of their pre&s;ent Number. The amazing natural Increa&s;e of the Coloni&s;ts, and the va&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion of Europeans to the Briti&s;h Ame|rica, have, in the Compa&s;s of Fifty or Sixty Years, &s;o enlarged the Number of its Inhabitants, and proportionably of the Members of the Church, that perhaps it is not inferior now, to the Number of Inhabitants in all the Dioce&s;&s;es in the Province of <HI>York,</HI> exclu&s;ive of Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>Should it be &s;aid, that the Church of England in America contains now near <HI>a Million</HI> of Mem|bers, the A&s;&s;ertion might be ju&s;tified. It is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the Number exactly, in a Country &s;o widely extended and unequally peopled; but from general Calculations it has been frequently &s;aid of late Years, that the proper Subjects of the Briti&s;h Crown in America amount to <HI>Three Mil|lions.</HI> This has been &s;aid even in the Parliament of Great-Britain, if our Information may be tru&s;ted &mdash;it has been repeatedly &s;aid in this Country, by &s;ome of our mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Writers. Strangers may be a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;o large an Account, but to others it is not incredible.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="010578_0037_0F86F09B8A91B810">An actual Survey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Communicated by a Gentleman of undoubted Veracity.</NOTE> of the Number of Inhabi|tants in 1762, with a Di&s;tribution of them into Cla&s;&s;es, according to their religious Profe&s;&s;ions, is &s;aid to have been carefully made: and it was then found, that, not including the new Colonies ceded by the la&s;t general Treaty of Peace, they amounted to between Two and Three Millions, in the Colonies and I&s;lands. Of the <HI>Whites,</HI> the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Church were about a third Part&mdash;the Pre&s;byterians, Independents and Anabapti&s;ts were not &s;o many&mdash;the Germans, Papi&s;ts and other De|nominations, amounted to more.</P>
<P>Let this Repre&s;entation be carefully con&s;idered, and it will appear in a very evident and &s;triking Light, that the Wants of the American Church, as it has been de&s;titute of Bi&s;hops, mu&s;t have na|turally increa&s;ed, and can amount now to little le&s;s than an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity. In the&s;e Circum&s;tances, could &s;uch a Number of Chri&s;tians, even under a Pagan Government, unle&s;s in a State of open Per|&s;ecution, provided they had always proved them|&s;elves loyal and faithful Subjects, apply in vain for a Favour, &s;o needful for them&s;elves, and &s;o harm|le&s;s to others? How much le&s;s Rea&s;on then can the Church in America have to fear a Refu&s;al in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, not only from a Chri&s;tian Na|tion, famed for its prudent Indulgence to all re|ligious Denominations in general&mdash;but from a Nation, which is moreover di&s;po&s;ed to befriend it, from peculiar Rea&s;ons both of Affection and Policy?</P>
<P>This Argument taken from the <HI>Number</HI> of tho&s;e who belong to the Church of England in America, will receive great additional Force, from a Con|&s;ideration of the State of the <HI>Blacks</HI> in our I&s;lands
<PB N="57" REF="010578_0037_0F86F09B8A91B810">
and Colonies; who were found, in the above-mentioned Survey, to be about Eight Hundred and Forty-four Thou&s;and. Although many of the&s;e, it is to be feared, through the Neglect of their Ma&s;ters, are not Chri&s;tians at all; yet, as they are connected with, and under the immediate Govern|ment of, Per&s;ons who profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity, they may be &s;aid, in an imperfect Sen&s;e, to belong to the re&s;pective religious Cla&s;&s;es of their Owners. However, their Situation is undoubtedly &s;uch, that in Proportion as a Sen&s;e of Religion prevails in their Ma&s;ters, they will receive Benefit. Now as the&s;e are known chiefly to belong to the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Church, if an Epi&s;copate will naturally tend to improve the State of Religion in the Church of England, it mu&s;t con&s;equently, (to &s;ay nothing of a particular Care which will probably be exten|ded to them, when Bi&s;hops &s;hall be &s;ettled) have a general good Effect upon more than half a Million of poor Creatures, Sharers with us of the &s;ame common Nature&mdash;&s;ent into the World as Proba|tioners and Candidates for the &s;ame glorious Im|mortality&mdash;whom Chri&s;t equally purcha&s;ed by his precious blood-&s;hedding&mdash;who notwith&s;tanding, as they are bred up in Ignorance and Darkne&s;s, are &s;uffered, to the eternal Di&s;grace of their Owners, to walk on "in the Shadow of Death," without a Ray of rational religious Hope to chear them.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration mu&s;t make a deep Impre&s;|&s;ion upon the Minds of all &s;erious Chri&s;tians, and lead them to encourage and help forward every Work, which has any probable Appearance of pro|moting the Spiritual Intere&s;ts, of &s;o many of the&s;e wretched Outca&s;ts of Humanity. If it is the Duty of Chri&s;tians to communicate <Q>the glad Tidings of Salvation</Q> to Heathens in general; it is a
<PB N="58" REF="010578_0038_0F86F09EDBC2C408">
Duty more peculiarly incumbent upon us, to ex|tend the Go&s;pel to &s;uch of them as are under our immediate Government and In&s;pection, and who wear out, under the hard Yoke of Bondage, their Strength and very Lives in our Service.</P>
<P>Another Argument for granting an American Epi&s;copate, ari&s;es from the Obligations of Grati|tude; a national Sen&s;e of which, it is humbly con|ceived, ought, at this Time, to have a peculiar Efficacy in Favour of Religion in the American Plantations. By a &s;ignal Interpo&s;ition of Divine Providence, the Briti&s;h Arms in America have triumphed over all that oppo&s;ed them, our Colo|nies have been prodigiou&s;ly extended, and our new Acqui&s;itions, together with our old Settlements, have been &s;ecured, not only by Treaty, but by a total Annihilation of that Power on this Continent, whereby our former Safety was chiefly endangered.</P>
<P>Every <HI>wi&s;e</HI> Nation &s;ees and acknowledges the Hand of God in the Production of &s;uch Events; and every <HI>religious</HI> Nation will endeavour to make &s;ome &s;uitable Returns to him for &s;uch extraordi|nary Favours. And what Returns are proper to be made in &s;uch Ca&s;es, one Moment's &s;erious Re|flection will clearly di&s;cover. The Circum&s;tances of Things evidently point out two Duties to our Governors, on this Occa&s;ion, both of them impor|tant in them&s;elves, and of indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligation: <HI>One</HI> is, the farther Security and Support of the true Religion in America, in tho&s;e Places where it al|ready is; and the <HI>other,</HI> the Propagation of it in tho&s;e Places, to which it has not hitherto been ex|tended.</P>
<P>As America is the Region, wherein the Divine Goodne&s;s has been more remarkably di&s;played, in
<PB N="59" REF="010578_0038_0F86F09EDBC2C408">
Favour of the Briti&s;h Nation; &s;o, America is evi|dently the very Ground, on which &s;ome &s;uitable Monument of religious Gratitude ought to be erected. This &s;hould be of &s;uch a Nature as to be vi&s;ible to the World, and, that the Honour of the Supreme Ruler of Events may be thereby im|mediately promoted. Now as the Honour of God is mo&s;t directly promoted by public Wor&s;hip&mdash;as that Wor&s;hip mu&s;t be mo&s;t acceptable to him, wherein the Prai&s;es and Adorations of his Creatures are regularly offered him, in the &s;olemn Offices of the pure&s;t and be&s;t Religion&mdash;and as the national Religion mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t to an&s;wer the&s;e Characters, in the national Opinion; it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that the State of the national Religion here has a Right, on this Occa&s;ion, to the peculiar Attention and Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who are in|tru&s;ted with the Direction of our public Affairs.</P>
<P>What then does the pre&s;ent State of this Reli|gion in America require to be done? What is <HI>po&s;|&s;ible</HI> to be done for its Benefit and Advantage? The&s;e are the Que&s;tions that, mu&s;t naturally ari&s;e. And every one that profe&s;&s;es it, every Witne&s;s of its &s;uffering Condition, is able to an&s;wer:&mdash;The Church of England in America, is peri&s;hing for Want of common Nece&s;&s;aries. She has long been imploring Relief, under &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es as mu&s;t prove fatal to her, if much longer neglected. She there|fore earne&s;tly reque&s;ts, and &s;he <HI>only</HI> reque&s;ts, that proper Remedies may be provided for her pre&s;ent Sufferings. And &s;he leaves it, with all due Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Wi&s;dom of her Superiors, whether any Thing farther is proper to be done, to &s;trengthen and improve her Intere&s;ts. She wi&s;hes for nothing, which &s;hall be thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rights and Safety of others. She a&s;ks

nothing, but what has been granted to others, without any ill Con&s;equences; and &s;he relies on the common Affection and Ju&s;tice of the Nation, to rai&s;e her to this Equality.

<P>Nothing can be plainer, even from the common Principles of Humanity and Benevolence, if we have no Regard to the &s;acred Injunctions of our holy Religion, than that it is the Duty of tho&s;e whom
<Q>the Day-Spring from on high hath vi|&s;ited,</Q>
to communicate this Light to others, and as they have Opportunity,
<Q>to give the Knowledge of Salvation</Q>
to tho&s;e that are without it,

&mdash;This is the indi&s;|pen&s;ible Duty of every private Chri&s;tian, and it is a Duty &s;till more &s;trongly incumbent upon every Chri&s;tian Nation; as the Means of &s;uch a Com|munication are more in the Power of a Nation, than of private Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The Situation and Circum&s;tances of &s;ome Na|tions are more favourable than tho&s;e of others, for

Attempts of this Nature. The faire&s;t Opportuni|ties are commonly in the Hands of trading Nations, like ours; to which Commerce opens a free Inter|cour&s;e with the unenlightened Parts of the Earth &mdash;and, when conducted fairly and properly, it is attended with &s;uch &s;en&s;ible pre&s;ent Advantages, that farther Propo&s;als for their &s;piritual Benefit, will probably be received, with le&s;s Prejudice, as coming from the Hands of their Benefactors.</P>
<P>When the Engli&s;h Nation fir&s;t propo&s;ed to e&s;ta|bli&s;h Settlements in America, the Propagation of the Go&s;pel among the native Inhabitants was al|ways mentioned as a principal Part of the Plan.

<P>How this original Plan came to be altered, and &s;o e&s;&s;ential a Part of it as the Conver&s;ion of the
<PB N="63" REF="010578_0040_0F86F0A0CD0363F0">
American Heathens, to be afterwards omitted, would require more Time to explain, than the in|tended Brevity of this Publication will admit of. That it has been altogether laid a&s;ide as a <HI>national</HI> De&s;ign, is too evident to be di&s;puted. And yet as the Nation has not rejected the Chri&s;tian Religion, but profe&s;&s;es to be governed by it, and to e&s;teem the Light of the Go&s;pel as an invaluable Ble&s;&s;ing, may it not be hoped that they may &s;till be per|&s;uaded to re&s;ume the Plan? Are there no Sparks of Chri&s;tian Compa&s;&s;ion remaining, to warm the Brea&s;ts of our national Rulers, in Favour of in|numerable Tribes of our Fellow-Creatures, origi|nally "made of one Blood" with us&mdash;with whom we are farther connected by Po&s;ition and political Ties&mdash;and who are &s;till
<Q>Strangers from the Co|venants of Promi&s;e, having no Hope, and with|out God in the World?</Q>
May it not be rea&s;on|ably expected, that &s;ome generous Efforts will be made, to furni&s;h them with the Means of rational and eternal Happine&s;s, of which mo&s;t of them con|tinue to be intirely de&s;titute? E&s;pecially, may it not be expected, under the peculiar Advantages which the pre&s;ent Sea&s;on affords?</P>
<P>The Providence of God, as has been ob&s;erved, points out this general Duty, by the late Events, more plainly and expre&s;sly than ever. We never had, until this Time, &s;o favourable an Opportu|nity for carrying forward this ble&s;&s;ed Work. We never had it &s;o much in our Power; and our Ob|ligations of Gratitude were never &s;o &s;trong. A ne|ce&s;&s;ary Dependance of the Natives upon us, is now e&s;tabli&s;hed; as they can have Recour&s;e to no other European Nation, without the utmo&s;t Difficulty, for the Supply of their Nece&s;&s;ities. The Briti&s;h Standard is now erected in the Heart of their
<PB N="64" REF="010578_0041_0F86F0A190EF01B8" MS="y">
Country; and a friendly Communication is opened with many Tribes and Nations, who&s;e Names were unknown to us until very lately. The Influence of <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and <HI>French Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> cea&s;es to operate in tho&s;e Regions, where formerly every Attempt made by a Prote&s;tant Nation to propagate the Go&s;pel, was &s;ure of being counteracted as effectually as po&s;|&s;ible. In a Word, their Situation is now &s;uch, that no Opportunity or Chance remains for their ever hearing &s;o much as <HI>the Name</HI> of Chri&s;t, if they do not hear it from us.</P>
<P>What Influence the&s;e Con&s;iderations may have upon <HI>our Politicians,</HI> one who is no Politician will not undertake to determine. But certainly they mu&s;t deeply affect the Minds of all &s;erious Chri|&s;tians, and, one would think, of rational and con|&s;i&s;tent Dei&s;ts, who profe&s;s a Regard for natural Religion&mdash;the great Doctrines and Duties of which, are generally corrupted and violated by the Ame|rican Heathens, and will be mo&s;t effectually re&s;to|red and &s;ecured by the Propagation of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>After all, it may de&s;erve to be con&s;idered, Whe|ther, on the Principles of meer worldly Policy, &s;ome Pains and Expence prudently be&s;towed to|wards the Conver&s;ion of the&s;e Savages, would not turn to our Account? The nearer they are brought, in their Principles and Morals, to the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem, the more they will re&s;emble Chri&s;tians in their Way of Life. The Principles of the Go&s;pel, and the Manners of Savages, cannot con&s;i&s;t with each other, for any con&s;iderable Time. The more they improve in Civil Life, the more u&s;eful they will be to us in the Way of Commerce&mdash;and the le&s;s we &s;hall have to fear from their barbarous Cruelties, on any Occa&s;ion.
<Q>Nor &s;hould it be for|gotten, that every &s;ingle Indian, whom we make

<P>But while the Propagation of the Go&s;pel among&s;t the American Heathens has been altogether ne|glected, as a national Concern, many private Per|&s;ons, who&s;e eminent Abilities have been an Honour to the Nation&mdash;who&s;e univer&s;al Benevolence has been as con&s;picuous as their Abilities&mdash;and who&s;e Activity has been equal to their Benevolence&mdash; have not neglected to exert them&s;elves, in Behalf of the general Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity.

This truly <HI>honourable</HI> and illu&s;trious Per&s;on, amid&s;t his unwearied Application for the Improvement of religious and u&s;eful Knowledge at Home, found much Time and large Sums to be|&s;tow, for the Propagation of Chri&s;tian Knowledge, in different remote Parts of the Earth, and parti|cularly among&s;t the Natives of America.</P>
<P><HI>The Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> al|though, notwith&s;tanding they have been abu&s;ed in this Country by many petulant Tongues, and &s;ome petulant Pens, on this Account, the Conver&s;ion of Heathens was not their <HI>primary</HI> and original Ob|ject (for if we read the Hi&s;tory of its Ri&s;e, or exa|mine its Charter, which recites a particular Ca&s;e only, and makes Provi&s;ion for it, and may judge from thence, we &s;hall find it as evident as Language can make it, that the Support and Propagation of the Go&s;pel among&s;t our own People in America, was the immediate and principal De&s;ign of their Incorporation;) I &s;ay, this worthy Society, have mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly and vigorou&s;ly attempted, &s;o far as their more immediate Duty would admit of it,

the Conver&s;ion of the Indians in the neighbour|hood of our Settlements.</P>

It is a&s;toni&s;hing that &s;o gro&s;s a Mi&s;take &s;hould be once made&mdash;more &s;o, that it &s;hould continue to be &s;o often repeated&mdash;and mo&s;t of all, that it &s;hould be adopted by Writers, from who&s;e Accuracy better Things might be expected&mdash;e&s;pecially, as the Society never fails to publi&s;h yearly an exact Account of their Expences, and even to expre&s;s the Par|ticulars. This Mi&s;repre&s;entation may po&s;&s;ibly have been owing to no unfriendly Intentions; but yet, as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to cir|culate widely, it mu&s;t naturally have a bad Effect upon the Society, by preventing Benefactions. For &s;ome who be&s;tow Nothing, on the Suppo&s;ition that the Society's annual Expence is but One Thou&s;and Five Hundred Pounds, would, in all Probability, give liberally, if they knew it amounted to near Five Thou&s;and Pounds, which is really the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Society was incorporated in 1701. In Ten Years Time their Expences aro&s;e to One Thou&s;and Eight Hundred and Forty-&s;ix Pounds, Ten Shillings, and One Penny, <HI>per Annum</HI>; a Sum con&s;iderably larger than the above-mentioned Compilers have a&s;|&s;igned, even for the pre&s;ent Year. Their Expences have been gradually increa&s;ing, from their fir&s;t In&s;titution to the pre&s;ent Time. In 1740 their Expence was Three Thou&s;and Four Hun|dred and Forty Pounds; and in 1765 they expended Four Thou|&s;and Seven Hundred and Eighty Pounds, Five Shillings, and Three Pence&mdash;of which Sum Four Thou&s;and One Hundred and Forty-four Pounds, Five Shillings, and Three Pence, was paid in Salaries to Mi&s;&s;ionaries, Catechi&s;ts, &amp;c. and the Remainder was laid out in Books, Gratuities to Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and in defraying other inci|dental Charges.</P></NOTE> they have annually ex|pended in America for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, that their Progre&s;s in the Conver&s;ion of Heathens has been &s;o &s;mall. But when it comes to be con&s;idered, that their Benefactors have en|tru&s;ted them with their Donations, chiefly for other Purpo&s;es&mdash;and, that their Funds have never been &s;ufficient, to an&s;wer the Occa&s;ions that have ari&s;en in their more immediate Department&mdash;it is rather to be wondered, that they have been able to make any Attempts at all of this Nature, than that they
<PB N="67" REF="010578_0042_0F86F0A25424CCA0">
have done &s;o little. And yet they have always em|ployed &s;ome Per&s;on in this Service; and I believe it may be truly &s;aid, that they have never neglected any fair Opening to introduce the Go&s;pel among&s;t the American Heathens, e&s;pecially if proper Per|&s;ons could be found, to engage in &s;uch a Mi&s;&s;ion. But they can force none into this Service, which heretofore has been attended with great Danger, as well as Fatigue: they can only offer &s;uch Salaries and Rewards by Way of Inducement, as they have Abilities to offer. However, they have not been altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful in their Attempts. Several Hundreds, by Means of the Society, have been converted from Heatheni&s;m to the Chri&s;tian Faith, among whom &s;ome have been Ornaments to their new Profe&s;&s;ion, and an in&s;tructive Example to tho&s;e who have had better Advantages. Yet &s;till it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the Succe&s;s has not been pro|portionable to the Pains that have been taken; and from the repeated Trials that have been made, as well as from other Evidence, it appears, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome more effectual Way for the Conver|&s;ion of Savages, than has been yet taken.</P>
<P>As it was always known, that the living like Chri&s;tians with Re&s;pect to Religion, and like Sa|vages with Re&s;pect to civil Life, could not be re|conciled in the &s;ame Per&s;ons; it was hoped that the Conver&s;ion of Indians to the Chri&s;tian Religion, would naturally introduce among&s;t them Civility of Manners&mdash;and this was reckoned among the Ad|vantages to be expected from converting them. But it &s;eems now to be generally agreed, that what was propo&s;ed as a <HI>Con&s;equence,</HI> ought to be con&s;i|dered as a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Means,</HI> of &s;preading the Go&s;|pel among&s;t &s;avage Nations.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="010578_0043_0F86F0A312810B98">The Religion of the Go&s;pel was intended for Men and rea&s;onable Creatures, and not for Brutes, although in the Shape of Men. Until the&s;e Wretches therefore are, in &s;ome Degree, humani|zed, there can be but little Pro&s;pect of making them Chri&s;tians, to any la&s;ting and valuable Pur|po&s;e. <HI>The Society,</HI> for a long Time, &s;eem to have been growing &s;en&s;ible of this; but as another Me|thod had been undertaken, it was proper that a full Trial &s;hould be made of it.</P>
<P>The venerable Dr. <HI>Bray,</HI> who has not impro|perly been &s;tiled <HI>the Father of the Society,</HI> and than whom, no Man ever more carefully con&s;idered Subjects of this Nature, and but few have had bet|ter Opportunities of informing them&s;elves, was latterly of this Opinion. In his <HI>Memorial relating to the Conver&s;ion of the American Indians,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed to the then Commi&s;&s;aries of <HI>Maryland,</HI> and the Re&s;t of the Clergy, he has the following Para|graph.</P>
<P><Q>You mu&s;t earne&s;tly endeavour to bring them off from a wandering and idle Life, to a &s;ettled and indu&s;trious Way of living; it being impo&s;|&s;ible to conceive how any religious Impre&s;&s;ions and In&s;tructions &s;hould be given them to any Purpo&s;e, or remain upon them in their wandering State. Nor was it ever known in Fact, that Chri|&s;tianity did thrive among a rude and barbarous People, continuing in an un&s;ettled and &s;avage Way of living, as in the Nature of the Thing, it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould. And it is very remarkable, that as our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter came into the World when it had become mo&s;t <HI>civi|lized</HI>; and where it was &s;o, in a few Ages, Chri|&s;tianity over&s;pread the civilized Part of it: &s;o upon the Inundation of wild and barbarous Na|tions

into the Roman Empire, true Chri&s;tianity did &s;en&s;ibly decline; and Satan, by his Deputy or Vicegerent <HI>Anti-Chri&s;t,</HI> regained his Domi|nion over the greate&s;t Part of Chri&s;tendom, both in the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Parts of the Empire.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Stebbing,</HI> a Per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed Abilities and Penetration, and a Member of the Society, in his anniver&s;ary Sermon, delivers the &s;ame Senti|ments.
<Q>Of a general Conver&s;ion of the native Indians, (&s;ays he) I &s;ee no great Likelihood at pre&s;ent. If this is to be done by human Means, there mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary Preparations for human Means to operate. They mu&s;t be poli|&s;hed into good Manners&mdash;there mu&s;t be &s;ome common Intercour&s;e between us&mdash;we mu&s;t bring them to &s;ome good Liking of our Laws and Cu&s;toms. All this is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> where the Power of Miracles is wanting; and <HI>when,</HI> and whether <HI>ever,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> will be done, God only knows.</Q>
One of the grand Ob&s;tacles the Doctor complained of, is now happily removed; the others will always continue, until we heartily engage in the Removal of them. I might avail my&s;elf of the Names of more illu&s;trious Per&s;ons now Living; but farther Authorities are needle&s;s in &s;o plain a Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It having then become a &s;ettled Point, that the mo&s;t proper Way for converting Savages, is pre|viou&s;ly to in&s;truct them in the Arts and Manners of civil Life, <HI>the Society</HI> has been, for a con&s;ide|rable Time, carefully employed in collecting &s;uch Information and Intelligence, relating to this Sub|ject, as may enable them to form a proper Plan for civilizing the Natives of America, in Order to their becoming Chri&s;tians&mdash;in which great and good Work, they cannot doubt of meeting with all needful Encouragement. For this Purpo&s;e many
<PB N="70" REF="010578_0044_0F86F0A3CC93D558">
Per&s;ons in America have been particularly con&s;ul|ted, both Mi&s;&s;ionaries and others; and the Re&s;ult already is, that they have come to a general Deter|mination to erect Schools, for teaching the Indian Children the Elements of Agriculture, and the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary mechanic Arts, together with civilized Manners&mdash;to be followed by proper In&s;truction in the Chri&s;tian Religion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A School on much the &s;ame Plan has been e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;ome Years in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> under the Direction of the worthy Mr. <HI>Whet|lock</HI>; and its Beginnings are not unpromi&s;ing.</NOTE>. They have entered into Re&s;olutions for carrying into Execution a Scheme of this Nature, as &s;oon as proper Places can be fixed for the Erection of &s;uch Schools, and proper Per&s;ons be found to engage in the Service&mdash;tru&s;ting in that good Providence to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in this Un|dertaking, which has &s;o wonderfully &s;upported them in the Pro&s;ecution of their original Work.</P>
<P>But here a Number of Difficulties ari&s;e to retard their Progre&s;s. A Variety of Plans and Propo&s;als have been tran&s;mitted from this Country. The Per&s;ons who have been con&s;ulted, have their par|ticular Prejudices and Attachments. The Things and Places which one repre&s;ents as expedient, are condemned by another. And this mu&s;t of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity happen, where &s;o many Per&s;ons, uncon|nected together, and without Opportunities of con|&s;ulting one another, are called upon to give their Opinion of a Ca&s;e, like this, whereof mo&s;t of them mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have but a partial Knowledge.</P>
<P>To ballance and adju&s;t &s;o many different Opi|nions and Repre&s;entations, mu&s;t be the Work of much Time and Care, and will of Cour&s;e greatly retard the Execution of the general Plan. For one fal&s;e Step taken in the Beginning, may in Time produce Con&s;equences that are pernicious and fatal.
<PB N="71" REF="010578_0044_0F86F0A3CC93D558">
But the&s;e Difficulties would vani&s;h in a great Mea|&s;ure, under an American Epi&s;copate. Suitable Places for the Erection of Indian Schools, might be &s;peedily a&s;certained&mdash;proper Per&s;ons to be intru&s;ted with the immediate Care of them, might be found out and appointed&mdash;and when actually employed, the general Direction and Superintendency of a Bi&s;hop re&s;iding near them, would not only give Spirit to the Work, but would moreover be nece&s;|&s;ary to <HI>unite</HI> &s;o many Per&s;ons, in different Parts of the Country, who are independent of each other, and to make them regular and uniform in their Endeavours to promote the &s;ame general De&s;ign.</P>
<P>In a Sy&s;tem of this Kind, where a Number of Powers and Movements are to be employed to one common Purpo&s;e, a regular and con&s;i&s;tent Direction of them is as requi&s;ite, as of the diffe|rent mechanical Powers, in a Watch or a Clock. And the nearer the &s;uperintending Influence is, the better; for when it is pre&s;ent, if irregularities ari&s;e, they are &s;oon corrected, and are never &s;uffered long to continue. In other Ca&s;es, where a Number of Per&s;ons are employed in one general Work, a com|mon uniform Direction is allowed to be nece&s;&s;ary; and why this particular Ca&s;e &s;hould be an Excep|tion, will not be ea&s;y to &s;hew.</P>
<P>The Nece&s;&s;ity of one common Direction in the Ca&s;e before us, will probably be granted; but per|haps &s;ome may think it may as well be carried on without an Epi&s;copate. This is a Point which de|&s;erves &s;ome Examination. Although the general Direction of &s;uch a Work mu&s;t belong to <HI>the So|ciety</HI> at Home, &s;o long as it is carried on at the Expence of the Society; yet it will be highly re|qui&s;ite that a Superintendent in this Country &s;hould over&s;ee the Whole, with a Power to regulate the
<PB N="72" REF="010578_0045_0F86F0A514E9C280">
Behaviour of all that are immediately employed in it, to hear Complaints, to redre&s;s Grievances, and to correct Abu&s;es; to whom Application may ea&s;ily be made on all Emergencies.</P>
<P>Now the Que&s;tion is, Whether a Bi&s;hop would not be a more proper Per&s;on to be entru&s;ted with this Superintendency, than any other? And if we con&s;ider that the great End in View, is the Ad|vancement and Propagation of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion&mdash;and that many Clergymen as well as others mu&s;t be employed in the Service, there mu&s;t evi|dently appear to be a peculiar Propriety in carrying on this Work, under the Direction of a Bi&s;hop. Who can be &s;o proper to conduct a Plan for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, as one of that Order, to whom the Charge of the Go&s;pel was prin|cipally committed, and to whom a Ble&s;&s;ing was expre&s;sly promi&s;ed, in their Endeavours to pro|mote it? Who &s;o proper to govern Clergymen, as tho&s;e to whom the Government of them, together with that of the whole Church, was particularly in|tru&s;ted by its Divine Founder?</P>
<P>If &s;ome of the Ends of this Superintendency might as well be an&s;wered, by putting it into Lay-Hands, yet others manife&s;tly cannot. There mu&s;t be frequent Occa&s;ions for the Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e &s;piritual Powers, which are peculiar to the Epi&s;co|pal Office; and it will be of great Con&s;equence to the Succe&s;s of the Work, whether Recour&s;e may be had to a Bi&s;hop in &s;uch Ca&s;es ea&s;ily and &s;peedily, or whether the Application mu&s;t be made to one, at the Di&s;tance of more than a Thou&s;and Leagues.</P>
<P>It &s;hould al&s;o be con&s;idered, that &s;uch a Station mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily require &s;ome Per&s;on of eminent Abilities and Influence, to fill it properly. And
<PB N="73" REF="010578_0045_0F86F0A514E9C280">
although many &s;uch, at this Time, are to be found among&s;t the Laity; yet, where &s;hall we find one thus qualified, who is not too deeply engaged in Affairs of another Nature, to devote him&s;elf to this in &s;uch a Degree as will be nece&s;&s;ary? If &s;uch a one &s;hould be &s;ent from Home for this Purpo&s;e, he mu&s;t be &s;upported agreeably to his Rank and Cha|racter, the Expence of which <HI>the Society</HI> can by no Means afford. Whereas if there was a Bi&s;hop in America, this would be con&s;idered as Part of his Office; which he would therefore freely execute, without any Addition to the nece&s;&s;ary Charges. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons in this Country, who may be thought be&s;t qualified for &s;uch a Tru&s;t, I believe, are fully employed in other Matters already, and cannot be expected to relinqui&s;h them and engage in this, without a hand&s;ome Support.</P>
<P><HI>Sir William John&s;on,</HI> who, by his long Expe|rience in, and careful Attention to, Indian Affairs, is probably be&s;t qualified for this Direction, and is undoubtedly the be&s;t Judge of the&s;e Matters in America, has, on this Occa&s;ion, been particularly con&s;ulted by <HI>the Society,</HI> whereof he is a Member, and by &s;ome in this Country. The Opinion of the Matter, which mu&s;t always carry the greate&s;t Weight, is, that an American Epi&s;copate will greatly facilitate the Conver&s;ion of the Indians, upon any Plan that &s;hall be followed. He declares his Readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t and co-operate with a Bi&s;hop in &s;o good a Work, but &s;ays nothing of under|taking it as Principal, as the political Superinten|dency of Indian Affairs, with which he is inve&s;ted by the Government, already affords him &s;ufficient Employment.</P>
<P>What then remains to be done? Shall <HI>the Society,</HI> at an Expence which will in a great Mea&s;ure di&s;|enable

Or, will an Opportunity be granted them, of putting the Management of this important Affair into the Hands of an American Bi&s;hop&mdash;who can more properly and effectually execute the Office, and without any additional Ex|pence? If a Chri&s;tian Nation does not think fit to undertake this Work <HI>immediately,</HI> a Work which will probably be attended with many political Ad|vantages; yet &s;urely it cannot refu&s;e to give all due Countenance and needful Encouragement, to &s;uch benevolent Chri&s;tians and worthy Patriots, as are willing and de&s;irous to undertake it&mdash;e&s;pecially when this can be done, without burthening the Public.</P>

<P>THE De&s;ign of what has been offered in the foregoing Section,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. VIII.</NOTE> is to &s;hew&mdash;That the Pro|pagation of the Go&s;pel among&s;t tho&s;e who are Strangers to it, is a Duty incumbent upon every Chri&s;tian Nation, as they have Opportunity:&mdash; That the Engli&s;h Nation in particular has, at this Time, a much better Opportunity, for converting to the Chri&s;tian Faith the Heathen Nations on the Borders of our Settlements, than has heretofore offered, and that the Obligations of Gratitude to perform this Duty are &s;tronger, and the Providence of God points it out more plainly, than ever:&mdash; That the commercial and political Advantages to be expected from &s;uch a Conver&s;ion, if it can be effected, are a &s;trong Argument for attempting it, on the meer Principles of worldly Policy:&mdash;That the true Method to be taken for the Conver&s;ion of Savages, is by previou&s;ly teaching them the Arts and Manners of civil Life, in order to which, pro|per Schools in different Parts of the Country are nece&s;&s;ary:&mdash;That <HI>the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> not waiting to &s;ee what the Nation will attempt, have, on the&s;e Principles, formed a gene|ral Plan for the Erection of Indian Schools, with a De&s;ign to put it in Execution, as &s;oon, and as ex|ten&s;ively, as po&s;&s;ible:&mdash;And that in Order thereto, it is rea&s;onable to think, that an American Epi&s;co|pate
<PB N="76" REF="010578_0047_0F86F0A60C207E00" MS="y">
will be mo&s;t eminently u&s;eful, and indeed that the Work cannot be properly conducted with|out it. From the&s;e Con&s;iderations it evidently fol|lows, that every Friend, not only to the Church of England, but to Chri&s;tianity in general, ought mo&s;t earne&s;tly to de&s;ire the Settlement of Bi&s;hops in America, on <HI>this Account,</HI> and to u&s;e his Influ|ence for obtaining it.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons which have been offered in Favour of an American Epi&s;copate, appear to us to be of that real Weight and Importance as to de&s;erve, and we humbly hope that they will obtain, the Atten|tion of our Superiors; and if they are duly con|&s;idered, we are unable to conceive that they can fail of producing the de&s;ired Effect, under &s;o mild and equal a Sy&s;tem of Government.</P>
<P>The Principles of Liberty, Ju&s;tice and Benevo|lence, are the main Pillars that &s;upport the fair Fabrick of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution. It is the Glory of Briti&s;h Subjects, that they enjoy as much Happine&s;s and Freedom as is con&s;i&s;tent with Go|vernment, and infinitely more than is con&s;i&s;tent with the Want of Government&mdash;and that their Li|berties are &s;ecured by Laws that have been made by, and cannot be &s;u&s;pended or repealed without the Con&s;ent of, tho&s;e whom they have cho&s;en to act as their Repre&s;entatives. No undue Superio|rity over &s;ome can legally be claimed by others; and for every Act of Inju&s;tice or Oppre&s;&s;ion, a &s;ure Remedy is provided. Provi&s;ion has been carefully made, that all may have full Enjoyment both of civil and religious Liberty; and &s;o free and equitable an Execution of the Powers of Govern|ment is e&s;tabli&s;hed, that no Body of Subjects, not an Individual, can ju&s;tly complain of any Suffering or Grievance, without Confidence of Redre&s;s.
<PB N="77" REF="010578_0047_0F86F0A60C207E00">
Such is the happy Tendency of our Con&s;titution, and we tru&s;t that our pre&s;ent Rulers have a Di&s;po|&s;ition to act, in all Ca&s;es, agreeably to the Genius and Spirit of it.</P>
<P>Will not then the Complaints of near a Million of Briti&s;h Subjects in America, of unimpeached Loyalty and Fidelity, who are &s;uffering under the mo&s;t unprecedented Hard&s;hips with Regard to their Religion, an Intere&s;t dearer than Property and more invaluable than civil Liberty, be re|garded, and procure the Redre&s;s of &s;o intolerable a Grievance? When an impartial Tenderne&s;s and Care for the religious Rights of all, is the profe&s;&s;ed Principle of the Admini&s;tration, as well as of our Legi&s;lature, is it not ab&s;urd, and injurious, and ungrateful, to entertain any Su&s;picions, that &s;o large a Number of Subjects will be treated with a cruel Partiality?&mdash;of &s;uch Subjects e&s;pecially, as have ever been dutiful and faithful, and who &s;tand in a peculiar Connection with, and Relation to, the national Body? Can it be imagined that &s;o gro&s;s a Partiality again&s;t the national Religion, may ever be ju&s;tly imputed to the Briti&s;h Nation, as no other Nation upon Earth was ever guilty of? For no
<Q>Nation has ever treated their Gods, which are no Gods,</Q>
in &s;uch a Manner, as this Imputation would charge a Chri&s;tian and Prote&s;tant Nation with treating the great Sovereign of the World.</P>
<P>As therefore we cannot but hope that the Voice of &s;o many Petitioners will be heard, and that &s;o rea&s;onable a Reque&s;t will be granted; &s;o we cannot but flatter our&s;elves that it will be granted <HI>&s;peedily,</HI> and that no unnece&s;&s;ary Delays will prevent its good Effect. The Rea&s;ons which have been a&s;&s;igned for granting us an Epi&s;copate, are now in full

Force, and &s;tronger than ever; and if they require it at all, they require it <HI>immediately.</HI></P>
<P>It is not apprehended that any Difficulties can attend the Execution of this Plan at the pre&s;ent Time, which will not always continue; and &s;ome peculiar Motives and Advantages now concur to favour it, which probably no future Period will afford. If then our Application fails of Succe&s;s now, we &s;hall de&s;pair of it hereafter; and&mdash;we want Language to expre&s;s the ill Con&s;equences we fear from &s;uch a Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid implies not an Opinion, that there are at this Time <HI>no</HI> Difficulties in the Way, but only that there are no Difficulties but &s;uch as mu&s;t be always expected. We are very &s;en&s;ible that a Work of this Nature will have many to oppo&s;e it. Some will oppo&s;e it from an Enmity to all Religion. Others will oppo&s;e it from an En|mity, either open or &s;ecret, to the <HI>Prote&s;tant Re|ligion</HI>; of which the Church of England is confe&s;|&s;edly the &s;tronge&s;t Barrier again&s;t Popery. There are others again who heretofore have oppo&s;ed it, from an Apprehen&s;ion, that either the Property or religious Liberty of their Friends might be affected by it; as it was not &s;o well known, with what Powers and with what Views it had been reque&s;ted that Bi&s;hops might be &s;ent to us. But this has been &s;o often and explicitly mentioned of late, that it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any Per&s;ons of Power and Influence can remain ignorant of our true Plan.</P>
<P>However, for the Sake of others, and of &s;uch as mi&s;take it, it may be proper, in a Work of this Nature, to make the following Declaration to the Public, (and I appeal to every Reader, who is ac|quainted
<PB N="79" REF="010578_0048_0F86F0A6DD4ACF50" MS="y">
with the Matter, for the Truth of it) that it has been long &s;ettled by our Friends and Supe|riors at Home, and the Clergy of this Country have often &s;ignified their entire Approbation and Ac|quie&s;cence therein&mdash;<HI>That the Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to America, &s;hall have no Authority, but purely of a Spiritual and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Nature, &s;uch as is derived altogether from the Church and not from the State&mdash; That this Authority &s;hall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laiety, nor Di&s;&s;en|ters of any Denomination&mdash;That the Bi&s;hops &s;hall not interfere with the Property or Privileges, whether civil or religious, of Churchmen or Di&s;&s;enters&mdash;That, in particular, they &s;hall have no Concern with the Probate of Wills, Letters of Guardian&s;hip and Ad|mini&s;tration, or Marriage-Licences, nor be Judges of any Ca&s;es relating thereto&mdash;But, that they &s;hall only exerci&s;e the original Powers of their Office as before &s;tated,</HI> i. e. <HI>ordain and govern the Clergy, and admi|ni&s;ter Confirmation to tho&s;e who &s;hall de&s;ire it.</HI></P>
<P>This, without any Re&s;ervation or Equivocation, is the exact Plan of an American Epi&s;copate which has been &s;ettled at Home; and it is the only one, on which Bi&s;hops have been reque&s;ted here, either in our general or more particular Addre&s;&s;es. And &s;o far is it from being our De&s;ire to mole&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, or any Denominations of Chri&s;tians, in the Enjoyment of their pre&s;ent religious Privileges, that we have carefully con&s;ulted their Safety and Security, and &s;tudied not to injure, but oblige them.</P>
<P>Many may have received different Accounts of our De&s;igns, and of our Conduct; but &s;uch as have not proceeded from Ignorance, mu&s;t have been the Effect of Maliciou&s;ne&s;s. When Bi&s;hops were fir&s;t propo&s;ed and reque&s;ted for this Country, they were

mentioned under the Title of <HI>Suffragans.</HI> This is no ambiguous Term; it has a fixed and deter|minate Meaning in the Laws of England, and can|not be mi&s;taken. Suffragan Bi&s;hops are the &s;ame with tho&s;e that were called <HI>Chorepi&s;copi,</HI> or Bi&s;hops of the Country, in the primitive Church; and it is their Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;charge all Offices <HI>merely</HI> Epi&s;copal, in the remote Parts of the Dioce&s;s where|in they re&s;ide, according to the Direction of, and by Virtue of a Commi&s;&s;ion from, the Dioce&s;an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Grey's</HI> Sy&s;tem of Engli&s;h Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Law.</NOTE>.

And of this I am <HI>certain,</HI> that all our Addre&s;&s;es from this and &s;everal of the neighbouring Colonies, for many years, have had one con&s;i&s;tent and unvaried Tenor, agreeable to the preceding Explanation.</P>
<P>What Weight will be allowed to the&s;e A&s;&s;er|tions, the Author knows not; but the Authority of the following Declaration to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, contained in <HI>an An&s;wer to Dr. Mayhew's Ob&s;ervati|ons,</HI> cannot fairly be di&s;puted; as the Author of it, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a very high Dignitary in the Church, manife&s;tly di&s;covers that he is perfectly acquainted with the Affairs of <HI>the Society,</HI> and of the Church in America.

<P>Now what rea&s;onable Objections can be offered again&s;t &s;uch a Plan as this, which is &s;o univer&s;ally harmle&s;s in every Re&s;pect, that none can be injured by it; and &s;o u&s;eful withal, that near a Million of Per&s;ons will receive Benefit, and perhaps the Sal|vation of many Souls will be effected, by its being put in Execution? Can any Thing be promoted by it, but the Good of the Church? Can any Thing then be objected again&s;t it, but that this End will be promoted? But will any dare, in this Age of Briti&s;h Freedom and improved Liberty, to avow the Objection? Would not &s;uch a barefaced At|tempt thus wantonly to oppre&s;s us, and to prevent our Enjoyment of tho&s;e invaluable Rights, to which we are equally intitled with others&mdash;which there is no Pretence that we have ever forfeited&mdash; and no Appearance of a Di&s;po&s;ition to abu&s;e&mdash;

rou&s;e the Indignation and Re&s;entment of all the Friends of religious Liberty and Toleration, whe|ther Churchman or Di&s;&s;enters?</P>
<P>Every Oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a Plan, has the Nature of Per&s;ecution, and de&s;erves the Name. For to puni&s;h us for our religious Principles, when no Rea&s;ons of State require it, is Per&s;ecution in its &s;tricte&s;t and propere&s;t Sen&s;e. Will it be &s;aid, that the Prevention of an Epi&s;copate in America, is no Puni&s;hment? It may as well be &s;aid, that keeping a Man out of his Right is no Inju&s;tice. Whatever Evil is inflicted on us on account of our Principles or Practices, is properly Puni&s;hment; and every Good we are deprived of, is equivalent to an Evil inflicted. Wherever therefore an Evil is inflicted, or we are deprived of a Good, on account of our Religion, unle&s;s it be nece&s;&s;ary for the Security of the Public, we &s;uffer Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>As &s;uch Treatment has the very E&s;&s;ence of Per|&s;ecution, &s;o it can have its Source only in an into|lerant per&s;ecuting Di&s;po&s;ition. And it is not to be doubted but a Di&s;po&s;ition that will produce thus much, if armed with Power, would be productive of more&mdash;and that they, who only endeavour now to prevent our Enjoyment of tho&s;e Advantages, to which we are intitled by the Laws of God and the Con&s;titution, would bring us, if they could, to the Stake or the Gibbet. But what an Abomination is &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition and Behaviour, in the Eyes of every true Engli&s;hman, of every true Prote&s;tant! What an Indignity and Affront to the Nation, to de&s;ire it to countenance &s;uch Inju&s;tice and Cruelty!</P>
<P>It is hard to believe that any Prote&s;tants, e&s;pe|cially that any Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters, who have gene|rally, for a Century pa&s;t, been warm Advocates for
<PB N="83" REF="010578_0050_0F86F0A92EC85180" MS="y">
religious Liberty, and who are greatly indebted to a Toleration them&s;elves, can be &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, as to wi&s;h this Harm to the Members of the national Church. It would be a very ungrateful Return, for the mo&s;t ample, compleat and generous Tole|ration, which is this Day to be found upon Earth. Many of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Men belonging to that Body, have expre&s;&s;ed, on this Subject, Sentiments that are candid and liberal; and he who was late|ly con&s;idered in &s;ome Sen&s;e as their Head <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Samuel Chlandler.</NOTE>, when our Plan was explained to him, and his Opinion thereupon was de&s;ired, did not he&s;itate to declare his free Con&s;ent to, and Approbation of, American Bi&s;hops, in the Manner that we reque&s;t them.</P>
<P>The Principles of religious Liberty profe&s;&s;ed by the Di&s;&s;enters, mu&s;t not only re&s;train them from oppo&s;ing an American Epi&s;copate, as now &s;ettled and explained, but oblige them, if they would act con&s;i&s;tently, even to <HI>befriend</HI> it. Some of them, I am fully per&s;uaded, would freely join with us in our Applications for Bi&s;hops, it their A&s;&s;i&s;tance was needed, as we &s;hould be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, in Ca&s;e of the like Grievances; and all of them will really have a much wor&s;e Opinion of the Church of England in general, or of tho&s;e who belong to it, as probably their Reproaches on future Occa|&s;ions will te&s;tify, if this Matter &s;hould not be brought to a &s;peedy and happy Termination. For certainly nothing can more degrade our national Religion, in the Eyes of Di&s;&s;enters and others, both Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts, at Home and abroad, than to &s;ee that it is in &s;o &s;mall E&s;timation, and its Intere&s;t &s;o little regarded, by tho&s;e who profe&s;s it.</P>
<P>For, wherever Men are indifferent towards the Religion they profe&s;s, one of the&s;e Conclu&s;ions

will nece&s;&s;arily be made, and there is no preven|ting it&mdash;either that their Religion, upon a more intimate Acquaintance, appears to be unworthy of their E&s;teem and Affection&mdash;or, that its Profe&s;&s;ors are of an irreligious Character, and have no Regard for that which is the mo&s;t invaluable of all Things. And in either Ca&s;e, the Reputation of their Reli|gion will greatly &s;uffer.</P>
<P>At the Time of writing this, ca&s;ting my Eyes upon the <HI>Public Paper</HI> of the Day, I was &s;truck with the following Paragraph, &s;aid to be an An&s;wer from the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to the Empre&s;s of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> who had interpo&s;ed with that Monarch, in Behalf of his Prote&s;tant Subjects.
<Q>I have not forgot the Obligations I am under to the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;|&s;ia, among the Means which God Almighty made U&s;e of to rai&s;e me to the Throne: but when I came to it, I promi&s;ed the exact Ob&s;er|vation of my Religion throughout my Kingdom. If I was weak enough to abandon it, my Life and my Throne would be expo&s;ed to the ju&s;t Re&s;entment of my Subjects. I am threatened with forcible Means to oblige me to do what is a&s;ked of me, which would reduce me to an Extremity equally unhappy. I perceive &s;ome Danger in whatever Re&s;olution I may take; but I had rather be expo&s;ed to &s;uch as my <HI>Duty and Honour</HI> induce me to make Choice of; and from this Time I join with my Country in Defence of our holy Religion.</Q></P>
<P>On the Suppo&s;ition, that the Propo&s;als, made by her Ru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty to the King of Poland, were believed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Safety of the national Religion, there is Something &s;o &s;en&s;ible, &s;pirited and open in this Declaration, that every candid and con&s;i&s;tent Prote&s;tant mu&s;t applaud it,

at the &s;ame Time that he condemns the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion of Poland. Popery is a gro&s;s Corruption of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and it has been wrought up to its pre&s;ent State, by the Application and Po|licy of many Ages. It pre&s;ents to us, not the ami|able and undefiled Religion of the Go&s;pel, but under the Name of it, an intolerant Sy&s;tem, com|pounded of Super&s;tition, Ab&s;urdity, and I know not what; and it manife&s;tly appears to be the gene|ral Intere&s;t of Mankind, to endeavour, in the U&s;e of all proper and fair Means, to reform it. But although this appears to be &s;o evident to Prote|&s;tants, there are undoubtedly others, to whom it does not appear at all, and who believe the contrary.</P>
<P>As the King of Poland has &s;olemnly bound him|&s;elf by Oath, to maintain and defend the Popi&s;h Religion, we mu&s;t charitably &s;uppo&s;e that he be|lieves it to be true. And as he believes it to be true, and has &s;worn to maintain it, he cannot give it up, he cannot neglect it, without betraying his <HI>Duty and Honour,</HI> in the Opinion of all rea&s;onable and unprejudiced Per&s;ons. If therefore the Di&s;&s;en|ters and others, who are &s;en&s;ible of the Ab&s;urdities and Corruptions of the Popi&s;h Religion, cannot but commend this firm Adherence to it in his Po|li&s;h Maje&s;ty, &s;o long as he believes it to be the true Religion; &s;urely they mu&s;t at lea&s;t equally com|mend the like Conduct, with Regard to the na|tional Religion, in Prote&s;tant Princes&mdash;more e&s;pecially, when the Security of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Re|ligion, and a Toleration of tho&s;e who peaceably di&s;&s;ent from it, are allowed to be con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Public Paper we are told, that the Courts of <HI>London, Berlin</HI> and <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> have agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t and co-operate with the Ru&s;&s;ian Em|pre&s;s, in Favour of the Prote&s;tants in Poland. It

mu&s;t give Plea&s;ure to every con&s;iderate Prote&s;tant, to hear of &s;o generous an Effort to be made, pro|vided it be made properly, in Behalf of the refor|med Religion; and we cannot but earne&s;tly wi&s;h it Succe&s;s. But could it be conceived, that tho&s;e Powers who are thus active for the Prote&s;tant In|tere&s;t in foreign Countries, would neglect to en|courage it in their own proper Dominions, their Zeal for it abroad would be e&s;teemed but little bet|ter than political Grimace. And on this Principle our Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters would have a much better Opinion of the Church of England, and of our Superiors who are Members of it, if, while they warmly intere&s;t them&s;elves in Favour of Prote&s;tan|ti&s;m in Poland, they do not incon&s;i&s;tently neglect, what they profe&s;s to e&s;teem the pure&s;t Species of it, in our own Colonies. A true Regard for the Pro|te&s;tant Religion is not confined to particular Places: it will produce vigorous Endeavours to improve and &s;ecure it, and to render it as re&s;pectable as we can, in all Places; and e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Places, wherewith we are mo&s;t clo&s;ely connected, and wherein our Power and Influence are greate&s;t.</P>

<P>Indeed in the Time of the late Di&s;turbances oc|ca&s;ioned by the <HI>Stamp-Act,</HI> it was a&s;&s;erted in &s;ome of the <HI>London Papers,</HI> that the Fear of Bi&s;hops being &s;ent into America, was the principal Cau&s;e of that Unea&s;ine&s;s and Clamour, which rai&s;ed &s;uch a Flame in this Country. Every one here knew the A&s;&s;er|tion to be a vile and malicious Repre&s;entation of the Ca&s;e; and whoever could believe it to be true, mu&s;t have previou&s;ly conceived of the Americans, as being of all Creatures the mo&s;t wretchedly &s;tu|pid.

The Affair of Bi&s;hops has been mentioned and explained to many of them, and they appear to have no Di&s;po&s;ition to be jealous or unea&s;y on Ac|count of their coming.</P>

<Q>Whatever formidable Ideas of Epi&s;copacy, tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters that fled into America, might carry along with them, and tran&s;mit to their Po&s;terity, we can &s;afely aver, that Epi&s;copal Power, gran|ting that it was oppre&s;&s;ive formerly, is not &s;o now: and that Di&s;&s;enters at Home have no Rea&s;on to conceive any Terror of it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. XXX. Page 285.</NOTE>.</Q> If then the Di&s;&s;enters in England, who live under the im|mediate Juri&s;diction and Government of an Epi&s;|copate, find no Rea&s;on to complain or <Q>to conceive any Terror of it;</Q> &s;urely in America they can|not have Rea&s;on to be terrified at the Pro&s;pect of the &s;ame Epi&s;copate&mdash;e&s;pecially as they will not be under the Juri&s;diction and Government thereof in any Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>As all Power is liable to be abu&s;ed, and &s;ome Defects mu&s;t be expected in the be&s;t-regulated Government in this World, whether Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Civil; it is not denied but there have been for|merly &s;ome In&s;tances, wherein the Power of our Bi&s;hops has been &s;trained too high. But the&s;e may be con&s;idered rather as the Fault of the Times, in which neither the natural Rights of Men, nor the religious Rights of Chri&s;tians, were &s;o well de|fined and under&s;tood, as in the pre&s;ent Age. And even <HI>then,</HI> the Spirit of the Church of England like
<PB N="92" REF="010578_0055_0F86F0B038771400">
that of the Go&s;pel, was more
<Q>peaceable, gentle and ea&s;y to be entreated,</Q>
than that of any other national Church; and the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, to whom it was greatly owing, were treated with particular Re&s;pect on that Account. In what Light the mo&s;t eminent Reformers and foreign Prote&s;tants have always con&s;idered them and the Engli&s;h Prelacy, may be &s;een in <HI>The French Church's Apology for the Church of England</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bingham's Works,</HI> Folio Edition, Vol. II.</NOTE>, to which I mu&s;t refer tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of particular Information.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, I beg Leave to produce two &s;hort Extracts from that Work. The fir&s;t &s;hall be from a Declaration of the celebrated <HI>Peter du Moulin,</HI> an eminent Profe&s;&s;or of the French Church in the Beginning of the la&s;t Century, in the fol|lowing Words:
<Q>I know that under Pretence that the Church of England hath another Form of Di&s;cipline than ours is, our Adver&s;aries (the Papi&s;ts) charge us that our Religion is divers. But Experience confuteth this Accu&s;ation.&mdash; The mo&s;t excellent Servants of God in our Churches, <HI>Peter Martyr, Calvin, Zanchius, Beza,</HI> &amp;c. have often written Letters full of Re&s;pect and Amity to the Prelates of England.&mdash;Our Adver&s;aries unju&s;tly accu&s;e us to be Enemies of the Epi&s;copal Order.</Q>
The other Extract &s;hall be from the Words of <HI>Calvin</HI> him&s;elf.
<Q>Give us &s;uch a Hierarchy (&s;ays he) in which <HI>Bi&s;hops pre&s;ide,</HI> who are &s;ubject to Chri&s;t and to him alone (not to the Pope) as their only Head; and then I will own no Cur&s;e too bad for him that &s;hall not pay the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect and <HI>Obe|bedience</HI> to &s;uch an Hierarchy as that.</Q>
And what <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;ays in general of &s;uch an Hierarchy
<PB N="93" REF="010578_0055_0F86F0B038771400" MS="y">
as ours, <HI>Beza</HI> and the mo&s;t illu&s;trious foreign Pro|te&s;tants have particularly applied to the Church of England.</P>
<P>If then <HI>Calvin</HI> and the mo&s;t celebrated foreign Prote&s;tants, were of Opinion, <HI>in former Times,</HI> that the Di&s;&s;enters in England ought peaceably to <HI>&s;ub|mit</HI> to the Government of our Bi&s;hops: &s;urely the Di&s;&s;enters in America <HI>now,</HI> when the Engli&s;h Epi&s;|copal Government is &s;o much milder than hereto|fore, will not oppo&s;e the very Exi&s;tence of Bi&s;hops in the &s;ame Country with them&s;elves&mdash;e&s;pecially as no Obedience or Submi&s;&s;ion at all from them is required or expected. But, as was &s;aid before, I take not this to be the pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition of Di&s;&s;enters in America, and believe that they would re&s;ent the Imputation of it as a gro&s;s Affront. They have acquired the &s;ame liberal Turn in their Sentiments and Manners, with the Di&s;&s;enters at Home; and provided there be no Inva&s;ion of their Privileges and Rights, they can live as quietly and peaceably with their Neighbours, although diffe|ring in Principles, and even with Bi&s;hops, as their Brethren can in any other Part of the World.</P>
<P>Some of them indeed formerly have had an Aver&s;ion to the Idea of Bi&s;hops in America, on the Suppo&s;ition that they mu&s;t become &s;ubject to their Authority. But the Plan which is now fixed, mu&s;t effectually obviate all their Objections and di&s;&s;ipate their Fears. As the Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed will have no Power over them, or Concern with them, there can be nothing to alarm them. <HI>Our</HI> Ordinations cannot hurt them; any more than <HI>their</HI> Ordinations can injure us. They can have no more Rea&s;on to complain of Confirmation, or of any other Epi&s;copal Office performed in our Churches by Bi&s;hops, than they now have to complain, that
<PB N="94" REF="010578_0056_0F86F0B0FAB8AB48" MS="y">
Preaching and the common Admini&s;tration of the Sacraments are practiced in them by Pre&s;byters. And as to &s;uch Di&s;cipline and Government as is in|tended to be exerci&s;ed under an Epi&s;copate, they will have no Rea&s;ons to be di&s;&s;atisfied therewith; any more than we now have to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the Di&s;cipline exerci&s;ed by them&mdash;but on the other Hand, they will have many Rea&s;ons to be plea&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Things in the Church of Eng|land in America, owing to the Want of a proper Superintendency and Government, with which they &s;ay they are offended; and the Removal of Offences will naturally give them Plea&s;ure. Sometimes they have been grieved, at &s;eeing the ill Behaviour of a Clergyman in the Orders of our Church; but by the Settlement of American Bi&s;hops, a Remedy will be provided for this Di&s;order. Sometimes they have lamented, that the Bi&s;hops at Home, and <HI>the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> have been impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e Accounts tran&s;mitted from hence by our American Clergy, (whether with or without ju&s;t and &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons, I will not &s;top to enquire); but under an Epi&s;copate, they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that there can be no Opportunity for any gro&s;s Impo&s;itions of this Nature. Sometimes, again, Complaints have been made, that, in Con|&s;equence of this fal&s;e Information, Mi&s;&s;ions have been erected in improper Places, and the Society's Bounty has been mi&s;applied; but of all &s;uch Ca&s;es Bi&s;hops in this Country will be competent Judges, and no Perver&s;ion or Abu&s;e of the Society's Fa|vours will be &s;uffered to continue. Some of them have &s;ignified that it would give them the utmo&s;t Plea&s;ure, to &s;ee more vigorous Efforts made by <HI>the Society,</HI> for propagating the Go&s;pel among&s;t the
<PB N="95" REF="010578_0056_0F86F0B0FAB8AB48" MS="y">
Heathens on our Borders: This Plea&s;ure the So|ciety intends to afford them, as &s;oon as Bi&s;hops &s;hall be &s;ettled in America, without which this im|portant Work cannot be conducted properly&mdash;and this is one Rea&s;on why an Epi&s;copate has been &s;o earne&s;tly reque&s;ted. I might in&s;tance in many other Particulars to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, but the&s;e are &s;uf|ficient to &s;hew, that an American Epi&s;copate will probably produce many Effects that will be agree|able to the Di&s;&s;enters. And as the Laws of Chri|&s;tian Charity and Benevolence oblige them to de|&s;ire it, for our Sake; &s;o they may be &s;uppo&s;ed, very con&s;i&s;tently, to de&s;ire it al&s;o for their own.</P>
<P>If our American Bi&s;hops are to have no Autho|rity over Di&s;&s;enters, nor indeed to exerci&s;e Di&s;ci|pline over our own People, the Clergy excepted; then the frightful Objection of <HI>Spiritual Courts</HI> in|tirely vani&s;hes. For if no Authority of this Kind will be claimed or exerci&s;ed by them, we may be &s;ure that no Courts will be erected for the Exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>What Foundation there is for Complaint of the Spiritual Courts in England, I know not. Per|haps they may have u&s;ed too great Severity in &s;ome particular In&s;tances. But this Complaint is not infrequently made, of our common Courts of Ju&s;tice. Cruelty and Severity is by no Means the Character of the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, nor is it connected with the Exerci&s;e of their Authority, more than with that of the civil Magi&s;trate: and in all Courts, whether Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or others, where an Injury is &s;uffered, the Laws of England have provided a Remedy.</P>
<P>If &s;ome of the Laws which relate to the&s;e Courts, are imagined to bear hard upon Briti&s;h Liberty,
<PB N="96" REF="010578_0057_0F86F0B1527DB808">
this, by the Way, is not nece&s;&s;arily to be con&s;idered as the Fault of the Bi&s;hops&mdash;it ought to be charged to the Account of the Legi&s;lature in general, and not of a particular Branch of it. But be this as it may, it is probable that the&s;e, and all other Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Laws, as well as our Liturgy and public Offices, and our Tran&s;lation of the Bible, will be reviewed, as &s;oon as it &s;hall be thought that there is good Sen&s;e and Candour enough in the Body of the Nation to admit of it.</P>
<P>Some undoubtedly blame the&s;e Courts, becau&s;e they find them&s;elves puni&s;hed therein for Actions, of which other Courts at pre&s;ent take no Cogni|zance. But &s;uch Per&s;ons do not con&s;ider, that if Spiritual Courts were aboli&s;hed, tho&s;e Actions which are pro&s;ecuted and brought to Trial there only, would many of them be made puni&s;hable in other Courts, as they were before the <HI>Norman Con|que&s;t</HI>; &s;ince they are e&s;teemed by the Legi&s;lature of the Nation to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the public Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the Spiritual Courts at Home, with all their De|fects, are an advantage to the Public; and that the Annihilation of them would be no Benefit to tho&s;e Individuals, who make the loude&s;t Com|plaints of them. But whether they are u&s;eful or hurtful, and whether the Aver&s;ion to them in this Country be rightly founded or not; as it is certain that they will never be e&s;tabli&s;hed here, they cannot with Propriety be made an Objection again&s;t an Epi&s;copate.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION X. The Ca&s;e of Tithes di&s;tinctly examined, and the Appre|hen&s;ion of being forced to pay them in this Country, proved to be intirely groundle&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>AS to <HI>Tithes,</HI> of which many Americans have had formidable Apprehen&s;ions, there could be no Rea&s;on to fear the Payment of them here, even &s;hould the Authority of our Bi&s;hops be as full and exten&s;ive as it is in England; and it is owing altogether to Ignorance and Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, that People here have ever given them&s;elves Unea&s;ine&s;s on that Account. As perhaps no Prejudice has taken deeper Root or extended wider in America than this, and as it &s;till continues to prevail in the Minds of many well-meaning but mi&s;taken People; &s;ome Pains taken to undeceive them, and to place this Subject in its true Light, will not be condem|ned by the friendly Reader.</P>
<P>Tithes cannot be demanded by Bi&s;hops in this Country, becau&s;e there are none belonging to the Church: they are demanded in England, only be|cau&s;e they are due to the Church. They are due to the Church there, becau&s;e they have been freely given to it, by the ancient Proprietors of the Lands; and the Laws relating to them do not <HI>convey</HI> them to the Church, but make them recoverable as its Property, to which it had a previous and compleat Right. This Right was ve&s;ted in the Church by King <HI>Ethelwulph,</HI> with the Con&s;ent of his Barons, in the Year 854. At this Time all the Lands in England were properly the Kings <HI>Deme&s;ne,</HI> and he
<PB N="98" REF="010578_0058_0F86F0B211EACEA8">
had as good a Right to di&s;po&s;e of any Part of them in this Manner, as any Proprietor or Owner of Lands in this Country has, to di&s;po&s;e of them to &s;uch Per&s;ons and for &s;uch Purpo&s;es as he thinks proper. Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> in his Comment upon <HI>Littleton's Tenures</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As quoted by Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></NOTE>, &s;ays:
<Q>It appeareth by the Laws and Ordinances of ancient Kings, and e&s;pe|cially of King <HI>Alfred,</HI> that the fir&s;t King of this Realm had all the Lands of England in <HI>Deme&s;ne,</HI> and <HI>les grands Manours</HI> and Royalties they re&s;er|ved to them&s;elves, and with the Remnant they for the Defence of the Realm enfeoffed the Ba|rons of the Realm with &s;uch Juri&s;diction as the Court Baron now hath.</Q></P>
<P>The very Charter, by which this Conveyance was made, is extant, we are told, in the old Ab|bot <HI>Ingulph,</HI> in <HI>Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and the <HI>Leiger Book</HI> of the Abbey of <HI>Abingdon.</HI> This Charter was &s;olemnly offered by the King on the Altar at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of his Bi&s;hops and Barons, and of <HI>Beored</HI> and <HI>Edmund,</HI> the Two tributary Princes of <HI>Mercia</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles,</HI> by whom it was al&s;o &s;igned; it was <HI>accepted</HI> by the Bi&s;hops in Behalf of the Church, and immediately <HI>publi&s;hed</HI> throughout all the Pari&s;hes in England. The Charter, as tran&s;lated by <HI>Collier,</HI> is in the fol|lowing Words:</P>
<P><Q>I <HI>Ethelwulph,</HI> by the Grace of God, King of the <HI>We&s;t-Saxons,</HI> with the Advice of the Bi&s;hops, Earls, and all the Per&s;ons of Condition in my Dominions, Have, for the Health of my Soul, the Good of my People, and the Pro&s;perity of my Kingdom, fixed upon a prudent and &s;er|viceable Re&s;olution of granting the Tenth Part
<PB N="99" REF="010578_0058_0F86F0B211EACEA8">
of the Lands throughout our whole Kingdom to the holy Churches and Mini&s;ters of Religion, officiating and &s;ettled in them, to be perpetually enjoyed by them, with all the Advantages of a Free Tenure and E&s;tate. It being likewi&s;e our Will and Plea&s;ure, that this unalterable and in|defea&s;ible Grant &s;hall for ever remain di&s;charged from all Service due to the Crown, and all other Incumbrances incident to <HI>Lay-Fees:</HI> which Grant has been made by us in Honour of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and all Saints; and out of Regard to the Pa&s;chal Solemnity, and that God Almighty might vouch&s;afe his Ble&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> upon us and our Po&s;terity. Signed Anno <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>Indiction</HI> the Second, at the Fea&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory,</HI> Vol. I. Page 156.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Afterwards, when a Di&s;tribution was made of the Lands to the <HI>Barons</HI> for the Defence of the King|dom, they received them under this Incumbrance; and by Conveyance and De&s;cent they have come down into the Hands of their pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, thus incumbered, <HI>i. e.</HI> Nine Parts as private Property, and the Tenth Part as, through all Changes, be|longing to the Church. When therefore the Tithe is paid to the Church, the Church only receives its own, and what never did, nor can rightfully, be|long to the Per&s;on who pays it.</P>
<P>To make the Nature of Tithes appear plainer if po&s;&s;ible, let us con&s;ider them in their mo&s;t &s;imple and original State, before any Alteration was introduced by <HI>Impropriations, Modus's,</HI> &amp;c. And here let us &s;uppo&s;e two E&s;tates of equal Value, each to be really worth One Thou&s;and Pounds, but one free from Tithes, the other titheable. If the&s;e two E&s;tates were to be &s;old, the Price of the fir&s;t would be its
<PB N="100" REF="010578_0059_0F86F0B2CB877250">
full Value One Thou&s;and Pounds, while that of the other would be abated, in Proportion to this In|cumberance. Or &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e two E&s;tates to be <HI>lea&s;ed</HI> at an annual Rent; in this Ca&s;e, if the former is rented at Fifty Pounds per Annum, the latter will be rated at Forty-five Pounds only, to be paid to the Landlord, the remaining Tenth Part being due and payable to the Church.</P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Ca&s;es the Nature of Tithes plainly appears; and it al&s;o appears, that none have Rea&s;on to complain of the Hard&s;hip of paying them, any more than of paying Rent to the Land|lord&mdash;or than he who receives Money belonging to the Church, can ju&s;tly complain of being accoun|table for the U&s;e of it. For as the Tenth Part of the Produce of the Land, in this latter Ca&s;e, be|longs to the Church, the Landlord never purcha&s;ed it, and con&s;equently he has no Right to receive it from the Tenant. If the Tenant pays Five Pounds in Tithes to the Church, he pays but Forty-five to the Landlord, in all Fifty Pounds; whereas, if he paid no Tithes, he would be obliged to pay the &s;ame Sum of Fifty Pounds to the Landlord. If Tithes were exactly paid in the Manner here &s;tated, neither Party would be injured in their Rights; the Church would receive Nothing but its own from the Land-Holder, nor the Land-Holder from the Church, and neither in this Ca&s;e would be injured or benefited.</P>
<P>Although the State of Tithes in England is now become more complex and intricate than is here &s;tated, owing to many Cau&s;es, which it is not my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s to a&s;&s;ign; yet their true Founda|tion and Original has been explained, from whence the general Nature of them, which continues the &s;ame, may be ea&s;ily under&s;tood. And it evidently
<PB N="101" REF="010578_0059_0F86F0B2CB877250">
follows from what has been &s;aid, that &s;o far as the Church is &s;upported in England by Tithes, e&s;pe|cially by <HI>Predial</HI> Tithes, it is &s;upported without any Expence to the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Some may imagine that the Tithes of mo&s;t Pari&s;hes in England mu&s;t amount to an enormous Sum, and that &s;uch exorbitant Wealth mu&s;t have a general bad Effect upon the Clergy. Whether this be &s;o or not, is, I confe&s;s, not immediately to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to con&s;ider. And yet, &s;ince I have entered upon the Subject, I would willingly, if po&s;&s;ible, remove every Prejudice and Mi&s;take concerning it, which have been conceived in the Minds of Americans. Every Prejudice relating to this Subject, contributes Something to that Aver|&s;ion to Bi&s;hops, which many are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The candid Reader will therefore excu&s;e my taking No|tice, even of &s;uch Prejudices as the&s;e, as not alto|gether impertinent to my general De&s;ign.</P>
<P>In what Manner Wealth has a natural Tendency to affect the Clergy, may be concluded from this common A&s;&s;ertion, &s;ometimes made with a friend|ly Intention, but perhaps more frequently with a malicious one, but which is &s;trictly and literally true, that <HI>the Clergy are but Men.</HI> For this will directly lead us to infer, that Wealth will operate upon them, much in the &s;ame Manner that it does upon Men in general. Upon &s;ome it will have a bad Effect, and upon others a good one, according to the prevailing Di&s;po&s;ition and Character of each Per&s;on re&s;pectively. But as it is hoped that, in Proportion to their Numbers, there is more true Piety and Virtue to be found among&s;t them, than in any other Order of Men; &s;o it will be expected, that their Wealth is proportionably employed to better Purpo&s;e. And, to &s;ay nothing of what has
<PB N="102" REF="010578_0060_0F86F0B38B66AF98">
been be&s;towed in <HI>private</HI> Charity, if we take a View of all the public In&s;titutions in the Kingdom, &s;uch as Colleges, Ho&s;pitals and charitable Societies; the Friends of the Clergy will have the Plea&s;ure to find, that none have been more forward than they, in affording all u&s;eful and charitable A&s;&s;i&s;tance to their Fellow-Creatures.</P>
<P>As to the other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Sugge&s;tion, concer|ning the Amount of Tithes; it is acknowledged, that if they were at this Day paid according to the original Grant of them, they would, in mo&s;t Pa|ri&s;hes, produce a large Revenue to the Church. But under the pre&s;ent Cu&s;toms and Regulations, I believe that there is not a Pari&s;h in England that pays a full Tithe, agreeably to the Intention of the Donors, in &s;uch a Manner that the Incumbent receives Five Pounds out of every Fifty Pounds produced by the Pari&s;h: But of this there is no Complaint, with Regard to tho&s;e Pari&s;hes, where the Clergy are &s;till provided for &s;ufficiently; and it is confe&s;&s;ed that there are &s;uch in the Kingdom. But the Number of them is very &s;mall, when com|pared with that of the Livings that fall &s;hort of it.</P>
<P>An Author of Reputation &s;ays:
<Q>It is well known that there are in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> about Three Thou&s;and parochial Cures, none of which exceed the yearly Value of Thirty Pounds a Year, Two Thou&s;and of which are not above Twenty Pounds a Year a piece, and a Thou&s;and of tho&s;e not above Twelve Pounds a Year. I, (&s;ays he) now Mini&s;ter to a Congregation of about Twelve Hundred People, in the deare&s;t Part of <HI>England,</HI> and almo&s;t daily am employed in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Cure, and yet have not Fifty Pounds per Annum certain, of which the Tithes are about Thirteen Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="010578_0060_0F86F0B38B66AF98">
and the Glebe about Twelve Pounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lewis's Examination of the Rights, <HI>&amp;c. Page 522.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
Now can it be imagined that the Tithes are fully paid in any of the&s;e Pari&s;hes, I mean that the Tenth Part of the yearly Value of the Lands in the Pari&s;h, is paid to the Incumbent? A landed E&s;tate of Three Hundred Pounds per Annum is e&s;teemed but mo|derate in any Part of England; and yet the com|pleat Tithe of &s;uch an E&s;tate is more, than all the Tithes that are actually paid in the large&s;t of Three Thou&s;and Pari&s;hes&mdash;as the proper Tithe of an E&s;tate of but One Hundred and Twenty Pounds per Annum, is equal to the Tithes received by the Incumbent, in a Thou&s;and Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>The Author mentions his own particular Ca&s;e, wherein he cannot mi&s;take. His Cure, I &s;uppo&s;e, he meant <HI>Margate</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> contained about Twelve Hundred People, which cannot be computed at le&s;s than Two Hundred Families, and his Tithes amounted to about Thirteen Pounds per Annum, <HI>i. e.</HI> not to One Shilling and Four Pence to a Fa|mily on an Average, which is but the Tenth Part of Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence.</P>
<P>From this Repre&s;entation, is it po&s;&s;ible not to &s;ee, that the Church at Home has &s;uffered a pro|digious Depredation of its Property? And that, in the Ca&s;e of Tithes, there are indeed the greate&s;t Rea&s;ons for Complaint&mdash;but not on the Side of tho&s;e who pay, but of tho&s;e who receive them? And yet, not &s;atisfied with the Injuries that are pa&s;t, &s;ome, it is &s;aid, &s;till pay with Reluctance the poor Pittance that is left! But, as has been ob|&s;erved, Men might as ju&s;tly refu&s;e to pay the Rent that is due to their Landlords, or any ju&s;t Debts whatever. For what is &s;aved from the full Pay|ment

of Tithes, where they are due, by any Arts or Eva&s;ions, is only &s;o much gained by the Plunder of the Church, already greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in many Pari&s;hes: a Species of Inju&s;tice which has the true Nature of <HI>Sacrilege,</HI> and is as highly criminal un|der the Go&s;pel, and even the Law of Nature, as it ever was under the Law of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>Let us now return, and proceed to the Appli|cation of what has been &s;aid on the Subject of Tithes, to the Ca&s;e of America. If any Per&s;on in America has given to the Church the Tithes of his E&s;tate, as po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may have done, although I have never heard of &s;uch an In&s;tance; the Church has unque&s;tionably a Right to receive it, whether we have Bi&s;hops or not. If any have given le&s;s or more than this Proportion, as &s;ome have; the Church has equally the &s;ame Right to receive it&mdash; the Right being not founded on the Circum&s;tance of its being preci&s;ely a <HI>Tenth</HI> Part, but on the free Gift and Conveyance of the legal Proprietor. Whatever has been given or conveyed to the Church, the Church has a Right to demand; what|ever has not been given or conveyed to the Church, belongs not to the Church, nor can it be claimed as its Property.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of Societies, whether Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Civil, is exactly the &s;ame, in Regard to the Acqui|&s;ition of Property, with that of Individuals. Nei|ther of them can obtain a Right to the Property of others, without the free Con&s;ent or Conveyance of the true Proprietors. The&s;e Principles are evi|dently and nece&s;&s;arily founded on the Law of Na|ture, and no Power, either divine or human, can rever&s;e them. Can any then be &s;o weak as to fear, that the Arrival of Bi&s;hops in America, will imme|diately cau&s;e the Nature and Relation of Things
<PB N="105" REF="010578_0061_0F86F0B5523ADEC0">
to be changed? The Re&s;idence and Power of more than Twenty Bi&s;hops in England have no general Effect upon private Property; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> may be very certain, that the Re&s;idence of one or two Bi&s;hops in this, which is a much larger Country, without any Power of a temporal Nature, will not affect it. In this Re&s;pect, at lea&s;t, our American Bi&s;hops will be like the Bi&s;hops of the primitive Church; they will content them&s;elves with &s;uch a Reception as they can obtain fairly, and claim no Perqui&s;ites, but &s;uch as &s;hall be freely granted them.</P>
<P>But although it is evident, that Tithes, in the pre&s;ent State of Things, cannot be claimed in this Country, and that Bi&s;hops cannot make any Change in the Nature of Property; yet &s;ome may go on to object, that the Laws of England relating to Tithes, will take Place in America, under an Epi&s;copate. I an&s;wer: tho&s;e Laws unle&s;s they are now binding in America, or have &s;ome enacting Clau&s;e to make them to be of Force here as &s;oon as we &s;hall have Bi&s;hops, neither of which will be pretended by the Objectors, can no more operate in this Country under an Epi&s;copate, than without one. They can never have any Effect here, until an Act of Parlia|ment &s;hall be made to extend them to us. And it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch an Act will be made; becau&s;e all that it could effect, is &s;ufficient|ly provided for already, by tho&s;e Laws which are univer&s;ally allowed to be in Force in America.</P>
<P>For, as has been before &s;hewn, the Laws which relate to Tithes in England, only enable the Church to recover them as its lawful and equitable Pro|perty, but do not make them its Property. There are many E&s;tates in England, which, notwith|&s;tanding tho&s;e Laws, pay no Tithes at all. This, in particular, is the Ca&s;e of mo&s;t of the Abbey-Lands
<PB N="106" REF="010578_0062_0F86F0B5F7759608">
which were ve&s;ted in the Crown, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. on the Di&s;&s;olution of the Mona&s;teries. If then the Laws in Que&s;tion make not E&s;tates titheable in England, a Per&s;on of the lowe&s;t Capacity can draw the Con&s;equence, that they can make none &s;o here.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI.
Farther Su&s;picions and Objections obviated, and the Subject concluded.</HEAD>
<P>BUT it may be inquired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. XI.</NOTE> whether <HI>new</HI> Laws will not be made, in Ca&s;e of an American Epi&s;copate, to &s;ubject us to the Payment of Tithes? But of this there can be no more Rea&s;on to be ap|prehen&s;ive, than if Bi&s;hops were not to be &s;ent hither. Tithes are not paid in England to Bi&s;hops, but to the Incumbents of Pari&s;hes; and the Clergy in this Country will have no greater Need of Tithes after the Arrival of Bi&s;hops, than they now have, and have had always. In &s;everal Provinces on this Continent, the Clergy are regularly and well &s;up|ported: and in the others, we have no Pro&s;pect but &s;till to depend, in a great Mea&s;ure, upon the Charity of our Benefactors at Home, until God &s;hall either enable or di&s;po&s;e our Friends in this Country to do more for us.</P>
<P>But as Ignorance is ever &s;u&s;picious, it may far|ther be a&s;ked, Shall we not be <HI>taxed</HI> in this Country for the Support of Bi&s;hops, if any &s;hall be appoin|ted? I an&s;wer, Not at all. But &s;hould a general Tax be laid upon the Country, and thereby a Sum be rai&s;ed &s;ufficient for the Purpo&s;e: and even &s;up|po&s;ing we &s;hould have three Bi&s;hops on the Con|tinent, which are the mo&s;t that have been men|tioned; yet I believe &s;uch a Tax would not amount to more than Four Pence in One Hundred Pounds. And this would be no mighty Hard&s;hip upon the Country. He that could think much of giving the
<PB N="108" REF="010578_0063_0F86F0B7434F4270">
Six Thou&s;andth Part of his Income to any U&s;e, which the Legi&s;lature of his Country &s;hould a&s;&s;ign, de&s;erves not to be con&s;idered in the Light of a good Subject, or Member of Society.</P>
<P>But no &s;uch Tax is intended, nor, I tru&s;t, will be wanted. It has been propo&s;ed from the very Beginning, that the American Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;upported without any Expence to this Country. A Fund accordingly has been e&s;tabli&s;hed, for this particular Purpo&s;e, for more than half a Century pa&s;t, under the Influence and Direction of <HI>the So|ciety for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel</HI>; and many worthy Per&s;ons have contributed generou&s;ly and largely to the Increa&s;e of it. I can recollect as I am writing, the following In&s;tances: Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tenni&s;on,</HI> who has been dead upwards of Fifty Years, bequeathed to it One Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling; Sir <HI>Jonathan Trelawney,</HI> near the &s;ame Time, another Thou&s;and Pounds; the Lady <HI>Eli|zabeth Ha&s;tings,</HI> Five Hundred Pounds; Bi&s;hop <HI>Butler,</HI> Five Hundred Pounds; Bi&s;hop <HI>Ben&s;on,</HI> Two Hundred Pounds; Bi&s;hop <HI>O&s;balde&s;ton,</HI> Five Hundred Pounds; and Mr. <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> One Thou&s;and Pounds. The&s;e, and all other Sums which the Society have received for this U&s;e, were put into the public Funds as &s;oon as paid into their Hands, and have been accumulating ever &s;ince, excepting what they expended at <HI>Burlington,</HI> in the Manner that has been mentioned. If this Stock is not &s;uf|ficient for the Support of a proper Epi&s;copate in America, I imagine the Difficulty in making it &s;uf|ficient, will not be great. For, as many have given liberally on the <HI>remote Pro&s;pect</HI> of its being needed, it is not to be doubted but Benefactors will be rai&s;ed up, when A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hall be called for by a <HI>pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="010578_0063_0F86F0B7434F4270">Another Objection has been made by &s;ome Per|&s;ons, to the following Purport; That if Bi&s;hops are once &s;ettled in America, although in the Man|ner we now propo&s;e, there will probably be an Augmentation of their Power, as &s;oon as Circum|&s;tances will admit of it: and what is ea&s;y and in|offen&s;ive in its Beginning, may become burthen|&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive in its End. But at this Rate there can be no End of objecting. For if every <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> ill Effect of a Thing, although confe&s;&s;edly proper in it&s;elf and harmle&s;s in its <HI>natural Tendency,</HI> may be made an Argument again&s;t it, there is no|thing that can e&s;cape. Arguments of this Sort may be as fairly and properly alledged&mdash;again&s;t a religious Toleration, which is now generally e&s;teemed by Prote&s;tants, to be a natural Right of Men, and a very important one of Chri&s;tians&mdash; again&s;t admitting tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from the na|tional Religion to any Degree of civil or military Power, to which, indeed, they have no natural Right&mdash;again&s;t allowing the common People the U&s;e of the Holy Scriptures, or the Liberty of exa|mining any Points of Religion or Government&mdash; again&s;t &s;uffering any to receive a learned Educa|tion, &amp;c. for none can tell what ill Con&s;equences and Abu&s;es may follow, in &s;ome future Period, from the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions and Indulgences. The Truth is, Men are not to be terrified or influenced by Fears of &s;uch Con&s;equences as are barely <HI>po&s;|&s;ible</HI>; but to con&s;ider what is rea&s;onable and pro|per in it&s;elf, and what Effects will <HI>probably</HI> and <HI>naturally</HI> follow.</P>
<P>That an American Epi&s;copate is rea&s;onable and proper in it&s;elf, and that &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as is now propo&s;ed has a natural Tendency to produce no ill Con&s;equences, has, I tru&s;t, been &s;ufficiently
<PB N="110" REF="010578_0064_0F86F0B74A5942F0">
proved. There is not the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect at pre&s;ent, that Bi&s;hops in this Country will acquire any In|fluence or Power, but what &s;hall ari&s;e from a ge|neral Opinion of their Abilities and Integrity, and a Conviction of their U&s;efulne&s;s and of this, no Per&s;ons need dread the Con&s;equences. But &s;hould the Government &s;ee fit hereafter to inve&s;t them with &s;ome Degree of civil Power worthy of their Acceptance, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay they will not, although there is no Appearance that they ever will; yet as no new Powers will be created in Favour of Bi&s;hops, it is inconceivable that any would thereby be injured. All that the Happine&s;s and Safety of the Public require, is, that the legi&s;lative and executive Power be placed in the Hands of &s;uch Per&s;ons, as are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t Abilities, Integrity and Prudence: and it is hoped that our Bi&s;hops will always be thought to de&s;erve this Character.</P>
<P>To explain in what Manner civil Power, if ve&s;ted in American Bi&s;hops, would be mo&s;t likely to operate, I beg Leave to put the following plain and familiar Ca&s;e. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a Clergyman in this Country, of any Denomination, made a <HI>Ju&s;tice of the Peace,</HI> or <HI>a Judge of the Quorum:</HI> Would the Per&s;ons who are immediately concer|ned in his Proceedings, be otherwi&s;e affected, than if he was a meer Layman? It cannot be preten|ded. Whether it would be proper to give &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion to any of the Clergy, is another Point. In mo&s;t Parts of this Country there can now be no Occa&s;ion for it, and where it is not evidently ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Good of the Public, I know that &s;ome of the Clergy would refu&s;e it, and I believe there are but very few that would de&s;ire it. If then it could be of no great Con&s;equence to the Public
<PB N="111" REF="010578_0064_0F86F0B74A5942F0">
or to Individuals, whether a Ju&s;tice of the Peace be a Clergyman or a Layman, &s;uppo&s;ing their Abilities and per&s;onal Characters to be equal; &s;o, if Bi&s;hops &s;hould be inve&s;ted with a proportionable Degree of civil Authority, neither would there be any great Rea&s;ons for Complaint. But after all, nothing of this Kind is at pre&s;ent fore&s;een or inten|ded; and it is ab&s;olutely determined that no Powers &s;hall be given them, that can interfere with the civil or religious Rights of any.</P>
<P>But there is no Occa&s;ion for dwelling on Parti|culars of this Nature. The real and only Plan on which it is agreed to &s;ettle Bi&s;hops in America, when his Maje&s;ty &s;hall &s;ee fit to appoint them, has been fairly &s;tated and explained in the preceeding Pages. This Plan is now propo&s;ed to the Public, to &s;ee whether any rea&s;onable Objections can be offered again&s;t it. But whatever may be objected again&s;t any different Plan, is not to the Purpo&s;e. The Friends of the Church are de&s;irous to know, what can be &s;aid or &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, in the Form wherein it is propo&s;ed to &s;ettle it; and they who have any Thing to offer, are reque&s;ted to confine them&s;elves to this parti|cular Point: For to object again&s;t Bi&s;hops in this Country, under a Form wherein it is determined not to &s;ettle them, is as foreign to the Purpo&s;e, as to object again&s;t the Authority of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gne&s;na,</HI> or the Pope of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>I have now taken Notice of all the Objections that have been made again&s;t &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America, &s;o far as they have come to my Know|ledge; and it mu&s;t be left to the Reader to judge, whether, with Regard to the Epi&s;copate in Que|&s;tion, they are not unrea&s;onable and groundle&s;s. It is indeed po&s;&s;ible that other Objections may have
<PB N="112" REF="010578_0065_0F86F0B80C840290">
been offered, or may be hereafter &s;ugge&s;ted, again&s;t American Bi&s;hops; but I am per&s;uaded that upon Examination they will generally be found to be Proofs, rather of the Dexterity or Ill-Will of the Inventors, than of the real Fears and Unea&s;ine&s;s of the Inhabitants. Ar ful Men may rai&s;e Objec|tions and Difficulties in the plaine&s;t Ca&s;es, and can make any Thing an Argument again&s;t any Thing, in a Way that &s;hall appear plau&s;ible, to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the Legerdemain of Cavilers and Sophi&s;ts. But whoever employs his Talents in this Exerci&s;e, is as unworthy of the public Attention, as the Child that engages in Crambo or Pu&s;h-Pin.</P>
<P>Thus, having repre&s;ented the Di&s;tre&s;s the Church of England in America is under, for Want of an Epi&s;copate&mdash;having attempted to prove, by various Arguments and Con&s;iderations, the Propriety and Fitne&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of relieving it, and of allow|ing it the &s;ame Advantages which are granted to all other Denominations of Chri&s;tians in his Ma|je&s;ty's American Dominions&mdash;and having explained the Nature and Extent of that Authority with which our Bi&s;hops will be inve&s;ted, when it &s;hall be thought proper to &s;end them, and &s;hewn that &s;uch an Appointment can produce no Harm to the Di&s;&s;enters, nor afford ju&s;t grounds of Unea&s;ine&s;s or Complaint to any; I mu&s;t now ha&s;ten to a Con|clu&s;ion, &s;ubmiting what has been offered to the Judgment of the Reader. Nothing has been a&s;|&s;erted, in the Cour&s;e of this Work, but what the Author believes, upon good Evidence, to be true; no Argument has been advanced, but with a full Per&s;ua&s;ion of its being pertinent and conclu&s;ive. He looks upon the Subject to be of the utmo&s;t
<PB N="113" REF="010578_0065_0F86F0B80C840290">
Importance; and he has no Di&s;po&s;ition to trifle with it, or with the Public to which he appeals.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Papers &s;hould have the Honour of coming into the Hands of any of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, from who&s;e Power or Influence an American Epi&s;|copate is in any Mea&s;ure expected; the Author humbly begs, that the Cau&s;e which he has under|taken to plead, may not &s;uffer, in their E&s;tima|tion, from the Un&s;kilfulne&s;s of its pre&s;ent; Advo|cate. Although he greatly di&s;tru&s;ts his own Management, he has no Diffidence of the Cau&s;e it&s;elf. He believes it to be the Cau&s;e of Truth, of Ju&s;tice, and of Chri&s;tianity, and as &s;uch he mo&s;t re&s;pectfully and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively recommends it, imploring their Attention to &s;o extraordinary and important a Ca&s;e, as that of the Church of Eng|land in America.</P>
<P>It need not be repeated, that unle&s;s Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;peedily &s;ent us, we can fore&s;ee nothing but the Ruin of the Church in this Country. It need not be &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;uch an Event is too much to be hazarded, when no Good can be ex|pected to ari&s;e from &s;uch a Ri&s;que, and much Evil will probably follow it&mdash;Evil, which it is the unque&s;tionable Duty of tho&s;e to prevent, who are intru&s;ted with the Intere&s;ts of the Nation. The Church of England here, is &s;o in&s;eparably con|nected with the Church at Home, or rather, is &s;o e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame with it, that it mu&s;t ever &s;ub|&s;i&s;t or peri&s;h, by the &s;ame Means. The Cau&s;es indeed, which de&s;troy it here, may be local, and not immediately operate in England; but then, that Inattention and Negligence in our national Superiors, which would &s;uffer it to be de&s;troyed in the Colonies, mu&s;t have a general Effect, and can produce no Good to the &s;ame Church in the
<PB N="114" REF="010578_0066_0F86F0BA72C0DFC8">
Mother-Country. Here, the Church has been long &s;truggling under &s;uch an increa&s;ing Load of Difficulties, and is now in &s;uch a State of Oppre&s;|&s;ion, as to de&s;erve the Compa&s;&s;ion&punc; of the whole Chri&s;tian World. From our own Nation, and the Guardians of its Intere&s;ts, it conceives it&s;elf to be intitled to more; as there is a Concurrence of every Kind of Motive for prevailing upon them, to afford it the Relief which is &s;o e&s;&s;entially needed. The common Principles of Ju&s;tice, and the mo&s;t &s;acred Obligations of the Chri&s;tian Religion, have been &s;hewn to require this at their Hands.</P>
<P>Nor need the Author u&s;e many Words to prove, that Con&s;iderations even of a political Nature, are &s;ufficient in this Ca&s;e, to prevail with tho&s;e who are in&s;en&s;ible to other Motives. The Church of England, in its external Polity, is &s;o happily con|nected and interwoven with the Civil Con&s;titution, that each mutually &s;upports and is &s;upported by the other. The greate&s;t Friend&s;hip and Harmony have ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them; and in that me|morable Period, wherein the Ruin of the one was effected, the De&s;truction of the other immediately followed. The Re&s;urrection of the one, after|wards clo&s;ely attended the Re&s;toration of the other; and he that has a Regard for the Happine&s;s of either, can never wi&s;h to &s;ee the Experiment re|peated, either in England or her Colonies.</P>
<P>It is not pretended that the Character and Man|ners of the pre&s;ent Times are, in this Re&s;pect, the &s;ame, as in the Period refered to; nor that tho&s;e who are Enemies to Epi&s;copacy in this Age, are Enemies to Monarchy, as was frequently the Ca&s;e formerly. The contrary is evident, in innume|rable In&s;tances. There are many Briti&s;h Subjects, both at Home and in the Plantations, who reject
<PB N="115" REF="010578_0066_0F86F0BA72C0DFC8">
Epi&s;copacy, and yet are warm Advocates for our happy Civil Con&s;titution. It is therefore ra&s;h and Injurious to charge any with Di&s;affection to the Government, at this Day, becau&s;e they di&s;&s;ent from the national Religion. But notwith&s;tanding, Epi&s;copacy and Monarchy are, in their Frame and Con&s;titution, be&s;t &s;uited to each other. Epi&s;co|pacy can never thrive in a Republican Govern|ment, nor Republican Principles in an Epi&s;copal Church. For the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, in a <HI>mixed</HI> Mo|narchy, no Form of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government can &s;o exactly harmonize with the State, as that of a <HI>qualified</HI> Epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P>And as they are mutually adapted to each other &s;o they are mutually introductive of each other. He that prefers Monarchy in the State, is more likely to approve of Epi&s;copacy in the Church, than a rigid Republican. On the other Hand, he that is for a Parity and a popular Government in the Church, will more ea&s;ily be led to approve of a &s;imilar Form of Government in the State, how little &s;oever he may &s;u&s;pect it him&s;elf. It is not then to be wondered, if our Civil Rulers have always con&s;idered Epi&s;copacy as the &s;ure&s;t Friend of Monarchy; and it may rea&s;onably be expected from tho&s;e in Authority, that they will &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Church in America, if from no other Motives, yet from a Regard to the State, with which it has &s;o friendly and clo&s;e an Alliance.</P>
<P>But there is no Rea&s;on to doubt, but every proper Motive will have its Effect, upon tho&s;e wi&s;e and illu&s;trious Patriots, who now conduct our public Affairs. We no more &s;u&s;pect the Goodne&s;s of their Di&s;po&s;ition, than the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Cau&s;e, for which we are &s;o anxious. All that we can be ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive of, is, that to tho&s;e who
<PB N="116" REF="010578_0067_0F86F0BBA024B6C8">
re&s;ide at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, the Nece&s;&s;ity of relieving the Church in America, with <HI>all po&s;&s;ible Speed,</HI> may not be &s;o evident, as to tho&s;e who are Eye-Wit|ne&s;&s;es of its &s;uffering Condition. We therefore beg Leave to &s;ugge&s;t this&mdash;and earne&s;tly to reque&s;t, that the Relief, which we doubt not is intended, may be <HI>&s;peedily</HI> granted. The ill Effects of delay|ing it, may be irretrievable. The pre&s;ent favour|able Opportunity may be &s;oon lo&s;t, and then De|&s;pair will &s;ucceed our di&s;appointed Expectation.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who have been aver&s;e to American Bi&s;hops, and hitherto have &s;hewn a Di&s;po&s;ition to oppo&s;e their Settlement, I have but a Word more to offer. Their Prejudices, we charitably believe, mu&s;t have ari&s;en altogether from Mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of the Ca&s;e, and from the Fears which, from thence, have been conceived, of their becoming Sufferers, either in their Property or Privileges, by the Epi&s;|copate in Que&s;tion. The Subject is here placed in its true Light, and thereby, it is tru&s;ted, their Mi&s;apprehen&s;ions are fairly removed, and their con|&s;equent Fears are &s;hewn to be groundle&s;s. In&s;tead therefore of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, or of oppo&s;ing the Church in the Ca&s;e before us, we flatter our|&s;elves that they will act the Part which Genero&s;ity and Candour pre&s;cribe, and behave towards us as Fellow-Chri&s;tians and Prote&s;tants ought to behave to one another. If they have been led by Igno|rance or Mi&s;information to oppo&s;e a Cau&s;e, which they now find to be ju&s;t; their Duty obliges them to be careful for the future, at the very lea&s;t, not to ob&s;truct it. If they are in Reality the Friends of Truth, and Ju&s;tice, and Liberty, which they pretend and we are willing to believe them to be, they mu&s;t be heartily di&s;po&s;ed to act a friendly Part towards us, with Regard to an Epi&s;copate;
<PB N="117" REF="010578_0067_0F86F0BBA024B6C8">
which Di&s;po&s;ition will add greatly to their own Happine&s;s, as well as to ours. They know, by Experience, the ine&s;timable Value of tho&s;e Advan|tages, for which we have petitioned; and if we are as fairly intitled to them as any other Chri&s;tian So|cieties, they ought not to envy, but to take Plea|&s;ure in, our Enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>If all the religious Denominations in America, by the general Con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h Colonies, are to be treated on the Footing of a perfect Equa|lity, for which &s;ome have contended; then, the Church of England is as fully intitled to the com|pleat Enjoyment of its own Di&s;cipline and In&s;titu|tions, as any other Chri&s;tians. If any one Deno|mination is intitled to a Superiority above others, as is believed by many; then, the Claim of the Church of England to this Preference, is not to be di&s;puted. One of the&s;e mu&s;t be undoubtedly the Ca&s;e; and on either Suppo&s;ition, to endeavour to prevent the Epi&s;copate we have a&s;ked for, is In|ju&s;tice and Cruelty.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould remain unconvinced by the Argu|ments that have been advanced, or un&s;atisfied with the Solution of Objections that has been attempted, or &s;hould have any new Objections to offer; the Author will be ready, in Ca&s;e of a decent Notifi|cation of it, to recon&s;ider the former, and to exa|mine the latter&mdash;&s;hould it be thought proper by his Friends, upon who&s;e Judgment, in &s;uch Matters, he will always depend more, than upon his own. For the pre&s;ent, he begs Leave to conclude in the Words of an eminent Writer of the la&s;t Century, as they exactly repre&s;ent his own Di&s;po&s;ition and Sentiments:
<Q>I &s;hall heartily be&s;eech all tho&s;e who &s;hall plea&s;e to read what has been written, that if they meet with any Thing therein, which
<PB N="118" REF="010578_0068_0F86F0BCEB4DE448">
either is le&s;s fitly &s;poken, or not clearly evi|denced, they would give me Notice of it in &s;uch a charitable and Chri&s;tian Way, as I may be the <HI>better</HI> for it, and they not the <HI>wor&s;e.</HI> Which Favour if they plea&s;e to do me, they &s;hall be welcome to me as an Angel of God, &s;ent to con|duct me from the Lanes of Error into the open Ways of Truth. And doing the&s;e Chri&s;tian Offices to one another, we &s;hall by God's good Leave and Ble&s;&s;ing, not only hold the Bond of external Peace, but al&s;o in due Time be made Partakers of the Spirit of Unity. Which Ble&s;|&s;ing that the Lord would graciou&s;ly be&s;tow on his afflicted Church, is no &s;mall Part of our De|votions in the public Liturgy; where we are taught to pray unto Almighty God, that he would plea&s;e <HI>continually to in&s;pire his univer&s;al Church with the Spirit of Truth, Unity and Con|cord, and grant that all they which do confe&s;s his holy Name, may agree al&s;o in the Truth of his holy Word, and live in Unity and godly Love.</HI> Unto which Prayer he hath but little of a Chri|&s;tian, which doth not heartily &s;ay, <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the drawing up of the&s;e Papers, I have met with a Pamphlet intitled, <HI>A Demon&s;tra|tion of the uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion and holy Con&s;ecra|tion of the fir&s;t Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, being an Extract from Mr. Ward's Second Canto of his England's Reforma|tion: with an Introduction, Notes and an Appendix, containing the &s;olemn funeral Song of the native Iri&s;h. Printed</HI> M, DCC, LXVI. This curious Performance has been printed with great Secre&s;y, probably in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> although the Place and Name of the Printer be not mentioned, and as &s;ecretly di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t the Inhabitants of the remote Parts of the Country. The De&s;ign of it is to ridicule the Of|fice and Succe&s;&s;ion of our Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, and the Occa&s;ion of it appears to have been the late Application made by &s;ome of the Clergy, for <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>The Editor, in his Introduction, which he has endeavoured to &s;et to the Tune of <HI>Ward's Canto</HI> in doggerel Ver&s;e, <HI>ab&s;urdly</HI> a&s;&s;umes the Character of a <HI>Churchman,</HI> as he introduces his Hero to de|fend, what he even profe&s;&s;es to expo&s;e; whereas a Regard to Con&s;i&s;tency of Character, which is as nece&s;&s;ary in Works of Drollery and Humour as in any other, &s;hould have led him to appear in his
<PB N="120" REF="010578_0069_0F86F0BD9EBF27A0">
true Shape of an <HI>Anti-Epi&s;copalian,</HI> or rather of an <HI>Anti-Prote&s;tant.</HI></P>
<P>For the Story of the <HI>Nag's-Head</HI> Con&s;ecration, the only Engine with which this vain Mortal ad|vances to attack the Church, is well known to have been a Fiction of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> invented Forty Years after the Time wherein it is &s;aid to have been tran&s;acted, and when it was hoped that no direct Proof could be made of its Fal&s;ity. But he, who frequently
<Q>di&s;appointeth the Devices of the Crafty,</Q>
&s;o ordered it in his Providence, that what was thus infamou&s;ly projected to di&s;|honour the Church of England, is an eternal Mo|nument of Reproach to the Church that invented it, as it mu&s;t ever di&s;grace tho&s;e who endeavour to propagate it. But that the Reader may better judge of it, an Account of the whole Affair, as given by <HI>Bi&s;hop Burnet,</HI> is hereunto &s;ubjoined.</P>
<P>The Extract from <HI>Ward,</HI> which makes the Body and even the Soul of the Pamphlet, is no|thing el&s;e than a Repetition of this villainous Slan|der of the <HI>Nag's-Head</HI> Con&s;ecration in wretched Rhyme, cooked up and larded with &s;uch un&s;avory Ingredients, as mu&s;t render it offen&s;ive to every Per&s;on of the lea&s;t Delicacy, and can agree only with &s;uch Stomachs as can bear the Rankne&s;s of Train Oil. It is now generally agreed that Ridicule, even when managed with the greate&s;t Dexterity, is not the Te&s;t of Truth. If this Edi|tor thinks otherwi&s;e, let him try the Experiment with One or Two keener and better Pieces, which are recommended for the Improvement of him and his Friends, if peradventure he has any, I mean <HI>Butler's Hudibras</HI> and <HI>Swift's Tale of a Tub.</HI></P>
<P>The Appendix is intitled <HI>Remarks on the pre|ceeding Piece</HI>; wherein the Editor conde&s;cends to
<PB N="121" REF="010578_0069_0F86F0BD9EBF27A0">
come down to the Level of tame Pro&s;e, and ad|vances a Number of A&s;&s;ertions tending to di&s;credit Epi&s;copacy, which have been frequently and effec|tually confuted, and &s;hewn to be fal&s;e. For the Support of them, he refers to a Li&s;t of Authors, who have been often and abundantly an&s;wered, without taking the lea&s;t Notice of the An&s;wers; and concludes with a doleful Story of a poor Clergyman in Ireland who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be frightened to Death, and a Lamentation of the wild Iri&s;h on the Occa&s;ion. This, we may chari|tably &s;uppo&s;e, was intended for an Exploit of Wit; but it will puzzle a Reader of ordinary Sagacity, to di&s;cover any Thing, either in the Imagination, or Execution of it, that can ju&s;tly intitle it to this Character.</P>
<P>His whole Performance is clo&s;ed with this grace|ful Period:
<Q>I &s;hall conclude my Remarks with only adding, that <HI>I wi&s;h</HI> there may be no Occa|&s;ion to repeat this &s;olemn <HI>Dirge</HI> over your Bi&s;hop upon his Introduction.</Q>
The Danger here in|timated there is no great Rea&s;on to fear, as it is &s;ugge&s;ted, not by any public Appearances, but by the Ferocity and Rancour of his own Heart, of which his whole Performance is a Proof. But does he not &s;ay that he <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> the Occa&s;ion may not happen? Aye, indeed does he; but any one that reads his Pamphlet, will think it to be as cha|ritable and polite Treatment as he de&s;erves, to re|ply to him in the Words of <HI>Valerian,</HI> an old hone&s;t Capuchin, "<HI>Mentiris impudenti&s;&s;ime.</HI>"</P>
<P>Upon the Whole; I can venture to pronounce the Performance before me to be the mo&s;t unfair, impudent and malicious Thing I have met with; and I am per&s;uaded that tho&s;e whom he intended to &s;erve, or rather to deceive, will not thank him
<PB N="122" REF="010578_0070_0F86F0BE0AAEC1A8">
for his Trouble. For &s;o long as Men, in any to|lerable Sen&s;e, continue to be rea&s;onable Creatures, &s;uch Management mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a Di&s;grace to the Cau&s;e which it aims at promoting.</P>
<P>If this Per&s;on is alarmed at the Pro&s;pect of Bi&s;hops in America, Why does he not &s;tand forth fairly and produce his Objections? In the Name of Goodne&s;s, let him &s;hew, if he can, that the Church of England in this Country has no Need of Bi&s;hops&mdash;or that &s;he has no Right to expect that Bi&s;hops will be granted her&mdash;or that &s;uch an Indulgence will harm the Di&s;&s;enters. But con|&s;cious of his Weakne&s;s, &s;hould it be put to a fair Trial, he dares not venture into the open Field. Like a <HI>Cherokee,</HI> he choo&s;es rather to &s;kulk in the Dark, and to do what Mi&s;chief he can among&s;t &s;uch of the Inhabitants as he &s;u&s;pects to be mo&s;t weak and unguarded. Contrary to the Rules of Honour, and the Laws of all civilized Nations, like his Brother-Savages he attacks with poi&s;oned Arrows; and therewith he too is &s;upplied by the inveterate Enemies of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t. For, as has been ob&s;erved, this <HI>Nag's-Head</HI> Affair, was altogether a mean and wicked Contrivance of the Papi&s;ts, to bla&s;t the Reputation of the Engli&s;h Reformation. <HI>Ward</HI> was a notorious Papi&s;t, and his whole Book, from which this Extract is bor|rowed, was written for the very Purpo&s;e of &s;etting the Reformed Religion in a contemptible Light. What mu&s;t the World then think of &s;uch a Pub|lication as this? Or, of a Cau&s;e, that can require &s;uch an Advocate, and &s;uch Arts, to &s;upport it?</P>
<P>I will not give this <HI>poetico-pro&s;aic</HI> Haberda&s;her any farther Di&s;turbance, but leave him in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of as much Tranquillity and Satisfaction as &s;uch a Production, with the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his
<PB N="123" REF="010578_0070_0F86F0BE0AAEC1A8">
own evil Intentions, can afford him. Had his Views been <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> with whatever Abilities he had acquited him&s;elf, his Reward would have been greater. For there is much Truth in the Ob&s;er|vation of <HI>Father Gara&s;&s;e,</HI> &s;peaking of tho&s;e Au|thors that write with a <HI>good</HI> De&s;ign, that
<Q>when a poor Genius toils ince&s;&s;antly to produce &s;ome worthle&s;s ridiculous Piece, and for that Rea&s;on will never obtain the public Applau&s;e, yet that all his Pains might not pa&s;s unrewarded, God gives him a Self-Satisfaction, for which it would be an Inju&s;tice beyond Barbarity to envy him, And thus God, who is all ju&s;t, denies not even to <HI>Frogs</HI> the Plea&s;ure of being charmed with their own Mu&s;ic.</Q>

<HEAD>An Account of the Con&s;ecration of <HI>Archbi&s;hop Par|ker,</HI> and the Fable of the <HI>Nag's-Head</HI> confuted, by <HI>Bi&s;hop Burnet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"On the 8th Day of <HI>July</HI> the <HI>Cong&egrave; d' Elire</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Canterbury</HI>; and upon that, on the 22d of <HI>July,</HI> a <HI>Chapter</HI> was &s;ummoned to meet the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>; where the Dean and Prebendaries meeting, they, according to a Method often u&s;ed in their Elections, did by a Compromi&s;e refer it to the Dean to Name whom he plea&s;ed: and he naming Doctor <HI>Parker,</HI> according to the Queen's Letter, they all confirmed it, and publi&s;hed their Election, &s;inging <HI>Te Deum</HI> upon it. On the 9th of <HI>September</HI> the Great Seal was put to a Warrant for his Con&s;ecration, directed to the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Dure&s;me, Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells, Peterborough, Landaff</HI> and to <HI>Barlow</HI> and <HI>Scory</HI> (&s;tiled only Bi&s;hops, not being then elected to any Sees) requiring them to con&s;ecrate him. From this it appears, that neither <HI>Ton&s;tal, Bourn</HI> nor <HI>Pool</HI> were at that Time
<PB N="124" REF="010578_0071_0F86F0BECDF8EB68">
turned out: It &s;eems there were &s;ome Hope of gaining them to obey the Laws, and &s;o to continue in their Sees.</P>
<P>"This Matter was delayed to the 6th of <HI>De|cember.</HI> Whether this flowed from <HI>Parker's</HI> Un|willingne&s;s to engage in &s;o high a Station, or from any other &s;ecret Rea&s;on, I do not know. But then the Three Bi&s;hops la&s;t named refu&s;ing to do it a new Warrant pa&s;&s;ed under the Great Seal, to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff, Barlow</HI> Bi&s;hop Elect of <HI>Chiche&s;ter, Scory</HI> Bi&s;hop Elect of <HI>Hereford, Cover|dale</HI> late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Exeter, Hodgkins</HI> Bi&s;hop Suffra|gan of <HI>Bedford, John</HI> Suffragan of <HI>Thetford,</HI> and <HI>Bale</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI>; that they, or any Four of them, &s;hould con&s;ecrate him. So by Virtue of this, on the 9th of <HI>December, Barlow, Scory, Cover|dale</HI> and <HI>Hodgkins,</HI> met at the Church of <HI>St. Mary le Bow</HI>; where, according to the Cu&s;tom, the <HI>Cong&egrave; d' Elire,</HI> with the Election, and the Royal A&s;&s;ent&punc; to it, were to be brought before them: and the&s;e being read, Witne&s;&s;es were to be cited to prove the Election lawfully made; and all who would object to it were al&s;o cited. All the&s;e Things being performed according to Law, and none coming to object again&s;t the Election, they confirmed it according to the u&s;ual Manner. On the 17th of <HI>December, Parker</HI> was con&s;ecrated in the Chapel of <HI>Lambeth,</HI> by <HI>Barlow, Scory, Co|verdale,</HI> and <HI>Hodgkins,</HI> according to the Book of Ordinations made in King <HI>Edward's</HI> Time: Only the Ceremony of putting the Staff in his Hands was left out of the Office, in this Reign. He being thus con&s;ecrated him&s;elf, did afterwards con&s;ecrate Bi&s;hops for the other Sees: namely, <HI>Grindal</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>London, Cox,</HI> that had been King <HI>Edward's</HI> Almoner, Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely, Horn</HI> Bi&s;hop
<PB N="125" REF="010578_0071_0F86F0BECDF8EB68">
of <HI>Winche&s;ter, Sandys</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ter, Merick</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bangor, Young</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>St. David's, Bullingham</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln, Jewel</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sa|li&s;bury</HI> (the great Ornament of that Age for Lear|ning and Piety;) <HI>Davis</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>St. A&s;aph, Gue&s;t</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter, Berkley</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells, Bentham</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Litchfield, Alley</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and <HI>Par</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Peter|borough. Barlow</HI> and <HI>Scory</HI> were put into the Sees of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Hereford.</HI> And &s;ometime after this, in <HI>February</HI> 1561, <HI>Young</HI> was tran&s;lated from <HI>St. David's</HI> to <HI>York</HI>; there being now no Hopes of gaining <HI>Heath</HI> to continue in it: which it &s;eems had been long endeavoured, for it was now Two Years that that See had been in Vacancy. In like Manner, after &s;o long waiting to &s;ee if <HI>Ton&s;tal</HI> would conform, there being now no more hope of it, in <HI>March</HI> 1561, <HI>Pilkington</HI> was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dure&s;me. Be&s;t</HI> was afterwards made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and <HI>Downham</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>"I have given the more di&s;tinct Account of the&s;e Promotions, becau&s;e of a malicious Slander with which they were a&s;per&s;t in aftertimes. It was not thought on for Forty Years after this. But then it was forged, and publi&s;hed, and &s;pread over the World, with great Confidence, That <HI>Parker</HI> him|&s;elf was not legally nor truly con&s;ecrated. The Author of it was &s;aid to be one <HI>Neale,</HI> that had been &s;ometime one of <HI>Bonner's</HI> Chaplains. The Contrivance was, that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff</HI> being required by <HI>Bonner</HI> not to con&s;ecrate <HI>Parker,</HI> or to give Orders in his Dioce&s;s, did thereupon refu&s;e it: Upon that the Bi&s;hops Elect being met in <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> at the <HI>Nag's-Head</HI> Tavern, <HI>Neale,</HI> that had watched them thither, peeped in through an Hole of the Door, and &s;aw them in great Di&s;|order,
<PB N="126" REF="010578_0072_0F86F0BF928DA628">
finding the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff</HI> was intract|able. But (as the Tale goes on) <HI>Scory</HI> bids them all kneel, and he laid the Bible upon every one of their Heads or Shoulders, and &s;aid, <HI>Take thou Au|thority to preach the Word of God &s;incerely,</HI> and &s;o they ro&s;e up all Bi&s;hops. This Tale came &s;o late into the World, that <HI>Sanders</HI> and all the other Writers in Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth's</HI> Time, had never heard of it: otherwi&s;e we may be &s;ure they would not have concealed it. And if the Thing had been true, or if <HI>Neale</HI> had but pretended that he had &s;een any &s;uch Thing, there is no Rea&s;on to think he would have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it. But when it might be pre&s;umed that all tho&s;e Per&s;ons were dead that had been pre&s;ent at <HI>Parker's</HI> Con&s;ecra|tion, then was the Time to invent &s;uch a Story; for then it might be hoped that none could contra|dict it. And who could tell but that &s;ome who had &s;een Bi&s;hops go from <HI>Bow-Church</HI> to dine at that Tavern with their Civilians, as &s;ome have done after their Confirmation, might imagine that then was the Time of this <HI>Nag's-Head-Con&s;ecration.</HI> If it were boldly &s;aid, one or other might think he remembered it. But as it plea&s;ed God, there was one living that remembered the Contrary. The old Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who had been at the Con|&s;ecration, declared it was at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and de&s;cribed all the Circum&s;tances of it, and &s;atisfied all rea&s;on|able Men that it was according to the Form of the Church of England. The Regi&s;ters both of the See of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and of the Records of the Crown, do all fully agree with his Relation. For as <HI>Parker's Cong&egrave; d' Elire,</HI> with the Queen's A&s;&s;ent to his Election, and the Warrant for his Con&s;e|cration, are all under the Great Seal: So upon the Certificate made by tho&s;e who con&s;ecrated him, the
<PB N="127" REF="010578_0072_0F86F0BF928DA628">
Temporalities were re&s;tored by another Warrant al&s;o enrolled; which was to be &s;hewed to the Hou&s;e of Lords when he took his Place there. Be&s;ides that the Con&s;ecrations of all the other Bi&s;hops made by him, &s;hew that he alone was fir&s;t con&s;ecrated without any other. And above all other Te&s;timo|nies, the original In&s;trument of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Par|ker's</HI> Con&s;ecration lies &s;till among his other Papers in the Library of <HI>Corpus-Chri&s;ti</HI> College at <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> which I &s;aw and read. It is as manife&s;tly an original Writing, as any that I ever had in my Hands: I have put it in the Collection, for the more full Di&s;covery of the Impudence of that Fiction. But it &s;erved tho&s;e Ends for which it was de&s;igned. Weak People hearing it &s;o po&s;itively told by their Prie&s;ts, came to believe it; and I have my&s;elf met with many that &s;eemed &s;till to give &s;ome Credit to it, after all that clear Confutation of it, made by the mo&s;t ingenious and learned Bi&s;hop <HI>Bramhall,</HI> the late Primate of <HI>Ireland.</HI> Therefore I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to be larger in the Account of this Con&s;ecration; and the rather, be|cau&s;e of the Influence it hath into all the Ordina|tions that have been &s;ince that Time derived down in this Church." <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation,</HI> Vol. II.
