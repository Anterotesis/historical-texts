<HEAD>A SERIOUS ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A Sound mind in a &s;ound body, is &s;aid to be a &s;tate of the highe&s;t human happine&s;s indi|vidually; when the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are &s;eparate, a &s;ound mind, wi&s;e and prudent conduct, tend much to &s;upport and pre&s;erve an un&s;ound body: On the other hand, where the body is &s;ound, the con&s;titution &s;trong and healthy, if the mind is un|&s;ound, the governing principle weak and feeble, the body feels the injuries which en&s;ue, the health and con&s;titution often become enfeebled and &s;ickly, and untimely death clo&s;es the &s;cene. This rea&s;on|ing holds good politically, being &s;ometimes realized in bodies politick, and perhaps never more &s;o than in the conduct lately exhibited to mankind by Great-Britain. Her con&s;titution was &s;ound, &s;trong and firm, in a degree that drew admiration from the whole world; but, for want of a &s;ound mind, her directing and governing powers being imprudent and unwi&s;e, to &s;uch a debilitated and &s;ickly &s;tate is this fine con&s;titution reduced, that, without a change of regimen, her decea&s;e may not be very remote. Ame|rica

is a child of this parent, who long &s;ince, with many &s;evere pangs, &s;truggled into birth, and is now arrived to the &s;tate of manhood, and thrown off the re&s;traints of an unwi&s;e parent, is become ma&s;ter of his own will, and, like a lovely youth, hath &s;tepped upon the &s;tage of action. State phy&s;icians pronounce his con&s;titution &s;trong and &s;ound: the eyes of the world are &s;ingularly attentive to his conduct, in order to determine with certainty on the &s;oundne&s;s of his mind. It is the general Congre&s;s, as the head, that mu&s;t give the colouring, and &s;tamp wi&s;dom or folly on the coun&s;els of America. May they demon&s;trate to the world, that the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, a &s;ound mind in a &s;ound body, are in America politically united!</P>
<P>IT was a claim of freedom unfettered from the arbitrary control of others, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to free agents, and equally the gift of our beneficent Creator to all his rational children, which put fleets and armies into motion, covered earth and &s;eas with rapine and carnage, di&s;turbed the repo&s;e of Europe, and ex|hau&s;ted the trea&s;ure of nations. Now is the time to demon&s;trate to Europe, to the whole world, that America was in earne&s;t, and meant what &s;he &s;aid, when, with peculiar energy, and unan&s;werable rea|&s;oning, &s;he plead the cau&s;e of human nature, and with undaunted firmne&s;s in&s;i&s;ted, that <HI>all mankind</HI> came from the hand of their Creator <HI>equally free.</HI> Let not the world have an opportunity to charge her conduct with a contradiction to her &s;olemn and often repeated declarations; or to &s;ay that her &s;ons are not real friends to freedom; that they have been actuated in this awful conte&s;t by no higher motive than &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and intere&s;t, like the wicked &s;ervant in the go&s;pel, who, after his Lord had forgiven his
<PB N="5" REF="017839_0004_0F4ABDDB984E7150">
debt which he was utterly unable to pay, &s;hewed the mo&s;t cruel &s;everity to a fellow &s;ervant for a tri|fling demand, and thereby brought on him&s;elf a puni&s;hment which his conduct ju&s;tly merited. Ye rulers of America beware: Let it appear to future ages, from the records of this day, that you not only profe&s;&s;ed to be advocates for freedom, but really were in&s;pired by the love of mankind, and wi&s;hed to &s;ecure the invaluable ble&s;&s;ing to all; that, as you di&s;dained to &s;ubmit to the unlimited control of others, you equally abhorred the crying crime of holding your fellow men, as much entitled to freedom as your&s;elves, the &s;ubjects of your undi&s;|puted will and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>HOWEVER habit and cu&s;tom may have render|ed familiar the degrading and ignominious di&s;tincti|ons, which are made between people with a black &s;kin and our&s;elves, I am not a&s;hamed to declare my&s;elf an advocate for the rights of that highly injured and abu&s;ed people; and were I ma&s;ter of all the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s per&s;ua&s;ion of Tully and Demo&s;thenes, could not employ it better, than in vindicating their rights as men, and forcing a blu&s;h on every Ameri|can &s;lave-holder, who has complained of the treat|ment we have received from Britain, which is no more to be equalled, with ours to negroes, than a barley corn is to the globe we inhabit. Mu&s;t not every generous foreigner feel a &s;ecret indignation ri&s;e in his brea&s;t when he hears the language of Americans upon any of their own rights as freemen, being in the lea&s;t infringed, and reflects that the&s;e very people are holding thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of their innocent fellow men in the mo&s;t deba&s;ing and abject &s;lavery, deprived of every right of freemen, except light and air?

<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ettlers of

were protected and de|fended
by the parent

exerci&s;ed a control over
their internal police, and
at length attempted to
levy taxes upon them,
and, by &s;tatute, declared
the colonies to be under
their juri&s;diction, and
that they had, and ought
to have, a right to make
laws to bind them in all
ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>

We need not now turn over the libraries of Europe for authorities to prove that blacks are born equally free with whites; it is de|clared and recorded as the &s;en&s;e of America: Cea&s;e then ye cruel ta&s;kma&s;ters, ye petty tyrants, from attempting to vindicate your having the &s;ame intere&s;t in your fellow men as in your cattle, and let blu&s;h|ing and confu&s;ion of face &s;trike every American, who henceforth &s;hall behold adverti&s;ements offer|ing their brethren to &s;ale, on a footing with brute bea&s;ts.</P>

parent &s;tate with all the bitterne&s;s of invective, for attempting to abridge our freedom, and invade our property; we are holding our brethren in the mo&s;t &s;ervile bondage, ca&s;t out from the <HI>benefit</HI> of our <HI>laws,</HI> and &s;ubjected to the cruel treatment of the mo&s;t imperious and &s;avage tempers, without <HI>redre&s;s,</HI> without advocate or friend.</P>
<P>OUR rulers have appointed days for humiliation, and offering up of prayer to our common Father to deliver us from <HI>our</HI> oppre&s;&s;ors, when &s;ighs and groans are piercing his holy ears from oppre&s;&s;ions which we commit a thou&s;and fold more grievous: pouring forth blood and trea&s;ure year after year in defence of our own <HI>rights;</HI> exerting the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous at|tention and care to &s;ecure them by laws and &s;ancti|ons, while the poor Africans are continued in chains of &s;lavery as creatures unworthy of notice in the&s;e high concerns, and left &s;ubject to laws di&s;graceful to humanity, and oppo&s;ite to every precept of chri|&s;tianty. One of the&s;e in effect gives Fifteen Pounds for the murder of a &s;lave; that is, after a &s;lave has ab&s;conded a certain time, Twenty Pounds is given to any one who &s;hall bring his head, and but Five Pounds if he is brought alive. Another, which empowers certain officers to &s;eize negroes &s;et free, and &s;ell them for the benefit of government: And, even during the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, negroes have been &s;eized with the e&s;tates of per&s;ons who had gone over to the Briti&s;h, and &s;old by publick auction into <HI>perpetual &s;lavery,</HI> and the proceeds ca&s;t into &s;tock for the <HI>defence</HI> of American <HI>liberty.</HI> Of the &s;ame complexion is an in&s;tance in New-Jer&s;ey: A female Quaker, about &s;even years &s;ince, manumitted her ne|groes; the times having reduced her &s;o as to be unable fully to di&s;charge a debt for which &s;he was

only &s;urety, the creditor, a great declaimer in be|half of <HI>American freedom,</HI> although he was offered his principal money, obtains a judgment, levies on the&s;e free negroes, who by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome real friends of freedom, procured a <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> and removed their ca&s;e before the ju&s;tices of the &s;upreme court. How many &s;uch mock patriots hath this day di&s;covered, who&s;e flinty hearts are as impervious to the tender feelings of humanity and commi&s;eration as the nether mill&s;tone; can &s;port with the rights of men; wallow and riot in the plunder, which their unhallowed hands have &s;queezed from others! But only touch <HI>their</HI> imma|culate intere&s;ts, and what an uncea&s;ing outcry in|vades every ear. A love for my country, a regard for the honour of America, rai&s;es an ardent wi&s;h, that this picture may never be realized in her rulers.</P>
<P>IT may be objected that there are many difficul|ties to be guarded again&s;t in &s;etting of negroes free, and that. were they all to be freed at once, they would be in a wor&s;e condition than at pre&s;ent. I admit that there is &s;ome weight in the&s;e objections; but are not the&s;e difficulties of our own creating? And mu&s;t the innocent continue to &s;uffer becau&s;e we have involved our&s;elves in difficulties? Let us do ju&s;tice as far as circum&s;tances will admit, give &s;uch mea&s;ure as we a&s;k, if we expect Heaven to favour us with the continuance of our hard earned liberty. The work mu&s;t be begun, or it can never be completed. "It is begun and many negroes are &s;et free." True, it is begun, but not in a manner likely to produce the de&s;ired <HI>end,</HI> the entire <HI>aboliti|on</HI> of <HI>&s;lavery.</HI> This is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;uperin|tending authority, the main &s;pring which gives motion to the whole political machine; which, were

they to undertake in good earne&s;t, I have no doubt but we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee a period &s;ixed, when our land &s;hould no longer be polluted with &s;lave-holders, nor give forth her increa&s;e to feed &s;laves: And in|deed it hath been a matter of wonder to many, that that body, who have been &s;o much employed in the &s;tudy and defence of the <HI>rights,</HI> of <HI>humanity,</HI> &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o many years to elap&s;e without any effectual movement in this bu&s;ine&s;s. Had they, with the declaration of independence, recommended it to the different Legi&s;latures to provide laws, de|claring, that no per&s;on imported into, or born in America after that date, &s;hould be held in &s;lavery: it would have been a &s;tep corre&s;pondent with our own <HI>claims,</HI> and in time, have completed the work, nor can I &s;ee any impropriety, but what the nature of the ca&s;e will ju&s;tify, to have it &s;till take place.</P>
<P>TO &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of this matter taking its ri&s;e at the head, if any thing effectual is done. I may in&s;tance the Quakers. Some among them, it is &s;aid, always bore a te&s;timony again&s;t &s;lavery from its first introduction, and the unea&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ing, advices were given forth cautioning their members again&s;t being concerned in importing &s;laves, to u&s;e tho&s;e well whom they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, &s;chool their children, <HI>&amp;c;.</HI> but &s;ome of the foremo&s;t of that &s;ociety having experienced the profits of their labour, no effectual &s;top could be put to the practice, tho' many became unea&s;y, and &s;et their negroes free, until the difficulties attending the late French and Indian war, brought the rights of men into a more clo&s;e in&s;pection, when a rule was agreed upon, pro|hibiting their members from being concerned with importing, buying, or &s;elling of &s;laves; and &s;ome years after a further rule was made, enjoining all

tho&s;e who held &s;laves to &s;et them free, otherwi&s;e to be &s;eparated from religious member&s;hip.&mdash;The work was then &s;oon accompli&s;hed, and they now &s;ay there are very few members belonging to the yearly meet|ing of Philadelphia who hold a &s;lave.</P>
<P>WHEN a grievance is general, it is but trifling to apply partial means; it is like attempting to de|&s;troy a great tree by nibbling at its branches. It is only the &s;upreme power which pervades the whole that can take it up by the roots.&mdash;The di&s;qui&s;itions and rea&s;onings of the pre&s;ent day on the rights of men, have opened the eyes of multitudes who clear|ly &s;ee, that, in advocating the rights of humanity, their &s;laves are equally included with them&s;elves, and that the arguments which they advance to con|vict others, rebounds with redoubled force back on them&s;elves, &s;o that few among us are now hardy enough to ju&s;tify &s;lavery, and yet will not relea&s;e their &s;laves; like hardened &s;inners, acknowledge their guilt, but di&s;cover no inclination to reform. It is true the&s;e convictions have occa&s;ioned the re|lea&s;e of many &s;laves, and two or three &s;tates to make &s;ome feeble efforts looking that way; but I fear, after the &s;un&s;hine of peace takes place, we have little more to expect, unle&s;s the &s;overeign power is exerted to fini&s;h this &s;in, and put an end to this crying tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>LET me now addre&s;s that augu&s;t body, who are by their brethren clothed with &s;overeign power, to fit at the helm, and give a direction to the impor|tant concerns of the American union. You, gen|tlemen, have, in behalf of America, <HI>declared</HI> to Europe, to the world, "That all men are born <HI>equal,</HI> and, by the <HI>immutable laws</HI> of <HI>nature,</HI> are <HI>equally</HI> entitled to liberty."

We are encouraged in this expectation by the &s;econd article of your nonimportation agreement in be|half of America, October 1774, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> "That we will neither import nor purcha&s;e any &s;lave imported after the fir&s;t day of December next, after which time we will wholly di&s;continue the &s;lave-trade, and will neither be concerned in it our&s;elves, nor will we hire our ve&s;&s;els nor &s;ell our commodities or ma|nufactures to tho&s;e who are concerned in it."&mdash;And much would it have been for the honour of Ame|rica, had it been added and confirmed by laws in each &s;tate (nor will we &s;uffer &s;uch a &s;tigma to re|main on our land, as that it can produce &s;laves, therefore no child, born in any of the United States after this date, &s;hall be held in &s;lavery.)&mdash;But the children of &s;laves are private property, and cannot be taken from their ma&s;ters without a compen&s;ati|on! What! After it hath &s;o often been echoed from America, "All men are born equally free." "No man or body of men can have a legitimate property in, or control over their fellow-men, but by their own con&s;ent expre&s;&s;ed or implied.

it all hone&s;t men; it is trea&s;on again&s;t the rights of humanity, again&s;t the principles upon which the American revolution &s;tands, and by which the pre|&s;ent conte&s;t can only be ju&s;tified; to deny it, is to ju&s;tify Britain in her claims, and declare our&s;elves rebels. Wherefore our rulers undoubtedly ought to give the&s;e principles, the&s;e laws which them&s;elves have declared <HI>immutable,</HI> a due force and efficacy. This every wellwi&s;her to their country, either in a religious or political &s;en&s;e have a right to a&s;k and expect. But we have laws that will maintain us in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our &s;laves: "The fundamental law of nature being the good of mankind, no human &s;anctions can be good, or valid again&s;t it, but are of them&s;elves void, and ought to be re&s;i&s;t|ed," Lock. Therefore none can have ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint, &s;hould &s;o de&s;irable an event take place, as that no per&s;on brought into, or born within any of the United States after the declara|tion of independence, &s;hall be held a &s;lave.</P>
<P>WHEN I read the con&s;titutions of the different &s;tares, they afford a mournful idea of the partiality and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of man; the extraordinary care, and wi&s;e precautions they manife&s;t to guard and &s;ecure our own rights and privileges, without the lea&s;t notice of the injured Africans, or gleam of expec|tation afforded them, of being &s;harers of the gol|den fruitage, except in that of the Delaware &s;tate, who, to their la&s;ting honour, while they were hedging in their own, provided again&s;t the inva&s;i|on of the rights of others. By the twenty-&s;ixth article of their con&s;titution they re&s;olve, that "No per&s;on hereafter imported into this &s;tate from Afri|ca, ought to be held in &s;lavery under any pretence whatever; and no negro, indian or mulatto &s;lave,
<PB N="20" REF="017839_0019_0FA4BDF35F9A7058">
ought to be brought into this &s;tate for &s;ale from any part of the world." Had they went further and made provi&s;ion by which &s;lavery mu&s;t at length have terminated within their juri&s;diction, it would have been doing &s;omething to the purpo&s;e; and, as this is the only con&s;titution in which po&s;terity will &s;ee any regard paid to that abu&s;ed people, I hope the &s;ame humane con&s;iderations which led them &s;o far, will induce them to take the lead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this was written I had, by information, been led to believe, that the late Penn&s;ylvania &s;lave law was very partial and inadequate, but have &s;ince learned, that it is a judicious and well con&s;tructed law, which provides for the entire abolition of &s;lave|ry in that &s;tate.</NOTE> in doing their part toward putting an effectual end to this crying evil, which will ever remain a &s;tain to the annals of America.</P>

your negro laws calculated not to protect and de|fend them, but to augment and heighten their calamitous &s;ituation! Ca&s;t out and rejected by the regulations formed for the defence and &s;ecurity of the rights and privileges, and to guard and improve the morals and virtue of the whites: Left open to the gratification of every pa&s;&s;ion and criminal commerce with one another, as though they were brutes and not men; fornication, adultery, and all the rights of marriage union among blacks, con&s;idered be|neath the notice of tho&s;e rules and &s;anctions formed to humanize and re&s;train corrupt nature, or the regard of tho&s;e who&s;e duty it is to enforce them.
