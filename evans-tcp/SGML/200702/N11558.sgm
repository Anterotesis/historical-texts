<OPENER><SALUTE>MY EVER HONOURED FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not without the mo&s;t humiliating conviction of my want of ability that I now appear before you: But the &s;en&s;e I have of the obligation I am under to obey the calls of my country at all times, together with an ani|mating recollection of your indulgence exhibited upon &s;o many occa&s;ions, has induced me once more, unde&s;erving as I am, to throw my&s;elf upon that candor which looks with kindne&s;s on the feeble&s;t efforts of an hone&s;t mind.</P>
<P>YOU will not now expect the elegance, he learning, the fire, the enrapturing &s;trains of eloquence which charmed you when a LOVELL, a CHURCH, or a HANCOCK &s;pake; but you will permit me to &s;ay that with a &s;incerity, equal to their's, I mourn over my bleeding country: With them I weep at

her di&s;tre&s;s, and with them deeply re&s;ent the many injuries &s;he has received from the hands of cruel and unrea&s;onable men.</P>
<P>THAT per&s;onal freedom is the natural right of every man; and that property or an exclu&s;ive right to di&s;po&s;e of what he has hone&s;tly acquired by his own labor, nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es therefrom, are truths which common &s;en&s;e has placed be|yond the reach of contradiction. And no man or body of men can; without being guilty of flagrant inju&s;tice, claim a right to di&s;po&s;e of the per&s;ons or acqui&s;itions of any other man, or body of men, unle&s;s it can be proved that &s;uch a right has ari&s;en from &s;ome compact between the parties in which it has been explicitly and freely granted.</P>
<P>IF I may be indulged in taking a retro&s;pective view of the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of our country, it will be ea&s;y to deter|mine with what degree of ju&s;tice the late parliament of Great Britain have a&s;&s;umed the power of giving away <HI>that property</HI> which the Americans have earned by their labor.</P>
<P>OUR fathers, having nobly re&s;olved never to wear the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m, and &s;eeing the European world, at that time, thro' indolence and cowardice, falling a prey to tyranny; bravely threw them&s;elves upon the bo&s;om of the ocean; determined to find a place in which they might enjoy their freedom, or peri&s;h in the glorious attempt. Approving Heaven beheld the favourite ark dancing upon the waves, and graciou&s;ly

pre&s;erved it until the cho&s;en families were brought in &s;afety to the&s;e we&s;tern regions. They found the land &s;warming with &s;avages, who threatned death with every kind of tor|ture. But &s;avages, and death with torture, were far le&s;s ter|rible than &s;lavery:&mdash;Nothing was &s;o much the object of their abhorence as a tyrant's power:&mdash;They knew that it was more &s;afe to dwell with man in his mo&s;t unpoli&s;hed &s;tate than in a country where arbitrary power prevails. Even <HI>anarchy it&s;elf,</HI> that bugbear held up by the tools of power (though truly to be deprecated) is infinitely le&s;s dangerous to man|kind than <HI>arbitrary government. Anarchy</HI> can be but of &s;hort duration; for when men are at liberty to pur&s;ue that cour&s;e which is mo&s;t conducive to their own happine&s;s, they will &s;oon come into it, and from the rude&s;t &s;tate of nature, order and good government mu&s;t &s;oon ari&s;e. But <HI>tyranny,</HI> when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, entails its cur&s;e on a nation to the late&s;t period of time; unle&s;s &s;ome daring genius, in&s;pired by Heaven, &s;hall unappalled by danger, bravely form and exe|cute the arduous de&s;ign of re&s;toring liberty and life to his en&s;laved, murdered country.</P>
<P>THE tools of power in every age have racked their in|ventions to ju&s;tify the FEW in &s;porting with the happine&s;s of the MANY; and, having found their &s;ophi&s;try too weak to hold mankind in bondage, have impiou&s;ly dared to force <HI>religion,</HI> the daughter of the king of <HI>Heaven,</HI> to become a pro&s;titute in the &s;ervice of <HI>Hell.</HI> They taught that princes,
<PB N="8" REF="014608_0007_0F94343483A4E068">
honoured with the name of chri&s;tian, might bid defiance to the founder of their faith, might pillage pagan countries and deluge them with blood, only becau&s;e they boa&s;ted them&s;elves to be the di&s;ciples of that teacher who &s;trictly charged his followers to <HI>do to others as they would that others &s;hould do unto them.</HI></P>
<P>THIS country, having been di&s;covered by an Engli&s;h &s;ub|ject in the year 1620, was (according to the &s;y&s;tem which the blind &s;uper&s;tition of tho&s;e times &s;upported) deemed the pro|perty of the crown of England. Our ance&s;tors, when they re&s;olved to quit their native &s;oil, obtained from King James a grant of certain lands in North-America. This they pro|bably did to &s;ilence the cavils of their enemies, for it can|not be doubted, but they de&s;pi&s;ed the pretended right which he claimed thereto. Certain it is that he might, with equal propriety and ju&s;tice, have made them a grant of the planet Jupiter. And their &s;ub&s;equent conduct plainly &s;hews that they were too well acquainted with humanity and the prin|ciples of natural equity to &s;uppo&s;e that the grant gave them any right to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; they therefore entered into a treaty with the natives and bought from them the lands: Nor have I yet obtained any information that our ance&s;tors ever <HI>pleaded,</HI> or that the natives ever <HI>regarded</HI> the grant from the Engli&s;h crown: The bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted by the parties in the &s;ame independant manner that it would have been, had neither of them ever known or heard of the i&s;land of Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="014608_0008_0F943434C7888EF0">HAVING become the hone&s;t proprietors of the &s;oil, they immediately applied them&s;elves to the cultivation of it; and they &s;oon beheld the virgin earth teeming with riche&s;t fruits, a grateful recompence for their unwearied toil. The fields began to wave with ripening harve&s;ts, and the late barren wilderne&s;s was &s;een to blo&s;&s;om like the ro&s;e. The &s;avage natives &s;aw with wonder the delightful change, and quickly formed a &s;cheme to obtain <HI>that</HI> by fraud or force, <HI>which</HI> nature meant as the reward of indu&s;try alone. But the illu&s;trious emigrants &s;oon convinced the rude invaders that they were not le&s;s ready to take the field for battle than for labor; and the in&s;idious foe was driven from their borders as often as he ventured to di&s;turb them. The crown of England looked with indifference on the conte&s;t; our ance&s;tors were left alone to combat with the natives.&mdash; Nor is there any rea&s;on to believe, that it ever was intended by the one party, or expected by the other, that the <HI>grantor</HI> &s;hould defend and maintain the <HI>grantees</HI> in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands named in the patents. And it ap|pears plainly from the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times that neither the Prince nor the people of England thought them&s;elves much intere&s;ted in the matter. They had not then any idea of a thou&s;andth part of tho&s;e advantages which they &s;ince <HI>have</HI> and we are mo&s;t heartily willing they &s;hould <HI>&s;till continue</HI> to reap from us.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014608_0009_0F943435777C6438">BUT <HI>when</HI> at an infinite expence of toil and blood, this widely extended continent had been cultivated and defend|ed: <HI>When</HI> the hardy adventurers ju&s;tly expected that they and their de&s;cendants &s;hould peaceably have enjoyed the harve&s;t of tho&s;e fields which they had &s;own, and the fruit of tho&s;e vineyards which they had planted; this country was <HI>then</HI> thought worthy the attention of the Briti&s;h mini&s;|try; and the only ju&s;tifiable and only &s;ucce&s;sful means of rendering the colonies &s;erviceable to Britain were adopted. By an intercour&s;e of friendly offices, the two countries became &s;o united in affection, that they thought not of any di&s;tinct or &s;eperate intere&s;ts, they found both countries flouri&s;hing and happy. Britain &s;aw her commerce extend|ed and her wealth increa&s;ed; her lands rai&s;ed to an immen&s;e value, her fleets riding triumphant on the ocean, the terror of her arms &s;preading to every quarter of the globe. The coloni&s;t found him&s;elf free, and thought him&s;elf &s;ecure: He dwelt <HI>under his own vine and under his own figtree and had none to make him afraid</HI>: He knew indeed that by purcha&s;ing the manufactures of Great Britain he contributed to its greatne&s;s: He knew that all the wealth that his labour produced centered in Great Britain: But <HI>that</HI> far from ex|citing his envy filled him with the highe&s;t plea&s;ure; <HI>that thought</HI> &s;upported him in all his toils. When the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day was pa&s;t, he &s;olaced him&s;elf with the <HI>contemplation</HI> or perhaps entertained his li&s;tening family with the <HI>recital</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="014608_0010_0F9434363578A4F8">
of &s;ome great, &s;ome glorious tran&s;action which &s;hines con|&s;picuous in the hi&s;tory of Britain: Or perhaps his elevated fancy led him to foretell, with a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;tic confidence, the glory, power and duration of an empire which &s;hould extend from one end of the earth to the other: He &s;aw, or thought he &s;aw, the Briti&s;h nation ri&s;en to a pitch of grandeur which ca&s;t a veil over the Roman glory, and, ravi&s;hed with the praeview, boa&s;ted a race of Briti&s;h Kings, who&s;e names &s;hould eccho through tho&s;e realms where Cyrus, Alexander, and the Cae&s;ars were unknown; <HI>Princes</HI> for whom millions of grateful &s;ubjects redeemed from &s;lavery and pagan ignorance, &s;hould with thankful tongues offer up their prayers and prai&s;es to that tran&s;cend|antly great and beneficent being <HI>by whom Kings reign and Princes decree ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>THESE plea&s;ing connections might have continued; the&s;e delight&s;ome pro&s;pects might have been every day extended; and even the reveries of the mo&s;t warm imagination might have been realized; but unhappily for us, unhappily for Britain, the madne&s;s of an avaricious mini&s;ter of &s;tate has drawn a &s;able curtain over the charming &s;cene, and in its &s;tead has brought upon the &s;tage, di&s;cord, envy, hatred and revenge, with civil war clo&s;e in their rear.</P>
<P>SOME demon in an evil hour &s;ugge&s;ted to a &s;hort &s;ighted financier the hateful project of transfering the whole
<PB N="12" REF="014608_0011_0F943436F944EB50">
property of the King's &s;ubjects in America to his &s;ub|jects in Britain. The claim of the Briti&s;h parliament to tax the colonies can never be &s;upported but by &s;uch a TRANSFER; for the right of the hou&s;e of commons of Great Britain to originate any tax or to grant money is altoge|ther derived from their being elected by the people of Great Britain to act for them, and the people of Great Britain can|not confer on their <HI>repre&s;entatives</HI> a right to give or grant any thing which <HI>they them&s;elves</HI> have not a right to give or grant <HI>per&s;onally.</HI> Therefore it follows that if the members cho&s;en by the people of Great Britain to repre&s;ent them in parliament have by virtue of their being &s;o cho&s;en, any right to give or grant American property, or to lay any tax upon the lands or per&s;ons of the coloni&s;ts, it is becau&s;e the lands and people in the colonies are bona fide, owned by, and ju&s;tly belong to the people of Great Britain. But (as has been before ob&s;erved) every man has a natural right to per&s;onal freedom, con&s;equently a right to enjoy what is ac|quired by his own labor. And as it is evident that the pro|perty in this country has been acquired by our own labor, it is the duty of the people of Great Britain to produce &s;ome compact in which we have explicitly given up to them a right to di&s;po&s;e of our <HI>per&s;ons</HI> or <HI>property.</HI> Until this is done every attempt of their's, or of tho&s;e whom they have deputed to act for them to give or grant any part of our property is directly repugnant to every principle of
<PB N="13" REF="014608_0012_0F943437B5BBE3D0">
rea&s;on and natural ju&s;tice. But I may boldly &s;ay that &s;uch a compact never exi&s;ted, no, not even in imagination. Ne|verthele&s;s the repre&s;entatives of a nation, long famed for ju&s;tice and the exerci&s;e of every noble virtue, have been prevailed on to adopt the fatal &s;cheme; and although the dreadful con&s;equences of this wicked policy have already &s;haken the empire to its center; yet &s;till it is per&s;i&s;ted in. Regardle&s;s of the voice of rea&s;on&mdash;deaf to the prayers and &s;upplications&mdash;and unaffected with the flowing tears of &s;uf|fering millions, the Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;till hug the darling idol; and every rolling year affords fre&s;h in&s;tances of the ab&s;urd devotion with which they wor&s;hip it. Alas! how has the folly, the di&s;traction of the Briti&s;h coun&s;els bla&s;ted our &s;welling hopes and &s;pread a gloom over this we&s;tern hemi&s;phere. The hearts of Britons and Americans, which lately felt the generous glow of mutual confidence and love, now burn with jealou&s;y and rage. Though but of ye&s;terday I recollect (deeply affected at the ill boding change) the happy hours that pa&s;t whil&s;t Britain and America rejoiced in the pro&s;perity and greatne&s;s of each other, (Heaven grant tho&s;e halcyon days may &s;oon return.) But now the Briton too often looks on the American with an evious eye, taught to con&s;ider his ju&s;t plea for the enjoyment of his earnings as the effect of pride and &s;tubborn oppo&s;ition to the parent country. Whil&s;t the American beholds the Briton as the ruffian, ready <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to take away his property, and <HI>next,</HI> what
<PB N="14" REF="014608_0013_0F94343C142D1D88">
is dearer to every virtuous man, the liberty of his coun|try.</P>
<P>WHEN the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration had di&s;gu&s;ted the colonies to the highe&s;t degree, and the people of Great Bri|tain had by artifice and fal&s;hood been irritated again&s;t America, an army was &s;ent over to enforce &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to certain acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, which rea&s;on &s;corned to countenance, and which placemen and pen&s;ioners were found unable to &s;upport.</P>
<P>MARTIAL law and the government of a well regulated city are &s;o entirely different, that it has always been con&s;i|dered as improper to quarter troops in populous cities, as fre|quent di&s;putes mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e between the citizen and the &s;oldier, even if no previous animo&s;ities &s;ub&s;i&s;t. And it is further certain from a con&s;ideration of the nature of mankind, as well as from con&s;tant experience, that &s;tand|ing armies always endanger the liberty of the &s;ubject. But when the people on the one part, con&s;idered the army as &s;ent to en&s;lave them, and the army on the other were taught to look on the people as in a &s;tate of rebellion, it was but ju&s;t to fear the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. Our fears, we have &s;een, were but too well grounded.</P>
<P>THE many injuries offered to the town I pa&s;s over in &s;ilence. I cannot now mark out the path which led to that unequaled &s;cene of horror, the &s;ad remembrance of which
<PB N="15" REF="014608_0014_0F94343E13E00340">
takes the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul. The &s;anguinary theatre again opens; it&s;elf to view. The baleful images of terror croud around me&mdash;and di&s;contented gho&s;ts with hollow groans appear to &s;olemnize the anniver&s;ary of the FIFTH of MARCH.</P>
<P>APPROACH we then the melancholy walk of death. Hither let me call the gay companion, here let him drop a farewel tear upon that body which &s;o late he &s;aw vigorous and warm with &s;ocial mirth&mdash;Hither let me lead the tender mo|ther to weep over her beloved &s;on&mdash;Come widowed mourner, here &s;atiate thy grief; behold thy murdered hu&s;band ga&s;ping on the ground, and to complete the pomp|ous &s;how of wretchedne&s;s bring in each hand thy infant children to bewail their father's fate&mdash;Take heed, ye or|phan babes, le&s;t whil&s;t your &s;treaming eyes are fixed upon the gha&s;tly corp&s;e, <HI>your feet &s;lide on the &s;tones be&s;pattered with your father's brains.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After Mr. GRAY had been &s;hot through the body and had fallen dead on the ground&mdash; a bayonet was pu&s;hed through his &s;kull, part of the bone being broken his brains fell out upon the pavement.</NOTE> Enough! This tragedy need not be heightened by an infant weltering in the blood of him that gave it birth. Nature reluctant &s;hrinks already from the view, and the chilled blood rolls &s;lowly backward to its fountain. We wildly &s;tare about, and with amazement, a&s;k, who &s;pread this ruin round us? What wretch has dared deface the image of his God? Has haughty France or cruel Spain &s;ent forth her myrmidons? Has the grim &s;avage ru&s;hed again from the far di&s;tant wilderne&s;s? Or does &s;ome fiend, fierce from the depth of Hell, with all the rancour|ous
<PB N="16" REF="014608_0015_0F94343F11D907E0">
malice which the apo&s;tate damned can feel, twang her de&s;tructive bow and hurl her deadly arrows at our brea&s;t? No. None of the&s;e&mdash;but, how a&s;toni&s;hing! It is the hand of Britain that inflicts the wound. The arms of George our rightful King have been employed to &s;hed that blood which freely would have flown at his command when ju&s;tice or the honour of his crown had called his &s;ubjects to the field.</P>
<P>BUT pity, grief, a&s;toni&s;hment, with all the &s;ofter movements of the &s;oul mu&s;t now give way to &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions. Say, fellow-citizens, what dreadful thought now &s;wells your heaving bo&s;oms&mdash;You fly to arms&mdash;Sharp indignation fla&s;hes from each eye&mdash;Revenge gna&s;hes her iron teeth&mdash; Death grins an hideous &s;mile &s;ecure to drench his greedy jaws in human gore&mdash;Whil&s;t hovering furies darken all the air.</P>
<P>BUT &s;top, my bold adventurous countrymen, &s;tain not your weapons with the blood of Britons. Attend to rea&s;on's voice&mdash;Humanity puts in her claim&mdash;and &s;ues to be again admitted to her wonted &s;eat, the bo&s;om of the brave. Revenge is far beneath the noble mind. Many perhaps, compelled to rank among the vile a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, do from their inmo&s;t &s;ouls, dete&s;t the barbarous action. The winged death, &s;hot from your arms, may chance to pierce &s;ome brea&s;t that bleeds, already for your injured country.</P>
<P>THE &s;torm &s;ub&s;ides&mdash;a &s;olemn pau&s;e en&s;ues&mdash;You &s;pare upon condition they depart. They go&mdash;they quit your ci|ty
<PB N="17" REF="014608_0016_0F94343F4339E5B0">
&mdash;they no more &s;hall give offence.&mdash;Thus clo&s;es the important drama.</P>
<P>And could it have been conceived that we again &s;hou'd have &s;een a Briti&s;h army in our land, &s;ent to inforce obedience to acts of par|liament de&s;tructive of our liberty. But the royal ear far di&s;tant from this we&s;tern world, has been a&s;&s;aulted by the tongue of &s;lan|der; and villains, traiterous alike to king and country, have prevail'd upon a gracious prince to cloath his countenance with wrath, and to erect the ho&s;tile banner again&s;t a people ever affectionate and loyal to him and his illu&s;trious predece&s;&s;ors of the hou&s;e of Hanover. Our &s;treets are again filled with armed men: Our harbour is crouded with &s;hips of war; but the&s;e cannot intimidate us; our liberty mu&s;t be pre&s;erved; it is far dearer than <HI>life,</HI> we hold it even dear as our <HI>allegiance;</HI> we mu&s;t defend it again&s;t the attacks of <HI>friends</HI> as well as <HI>enemies</HI>; we cannot &s;uffer even BRITONS to ravi&s;h it from us.</P>
<P>No longer could we reflect with generous pride on the heroic acti|ons of our American fore-fathers,&mdash;no longer boa&s;t our origin from that far famed i&s;land, who&s;e warlike &s;ons have &s;o often drawn their well-tried &s;words to &s;ave her from the ravages of tyranny; could we but for a moment entertain the thought of giving up our liberty. The man who meanly will &s;ubmit to wear a <HI>&s;hackle,</HI> contemns the noble&s;t gift of Heaven, and impiou&s;ly affronts the God that made him free.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="014608_0017_0F9434414CB595F8">IT was a maxim of the Roman people, which eminently conduced to the greatne&s;s of that &s;tate never to de&s;pair of the common-wealth. The maxim may prove as &s;alutary to us now, as it did to them. Short &s;ighted mortals &s;ee not the numerous links of &s;mall and great events which form the chain on which the fate of kings and nations is &s;u&s;pended. Ea&s;e and pro&s;perity, (tho' plea&s;ing for a day,) have often &s;unk a people into effeminacy and &s;loth. Hard&s;hips and dan|gers, (tho' we forever &s;trive to &s;hun them,) have frequently called forth &s;uch virtues, as have commanded the applau&s;e and reverence of an admiring world. Our country loudly calls you to be circum&s;pect, vigilant, active and brave. Perhaps, (all gracious Heaven avert it) perhaps, the power of Britain, a nation great in war, by &s;ome malig|nant influence, may be employed to en&s;lave you. But let not even this di&s;courage you. Her arms, 'tis true, have fill'd the world with terror: her troops have reap'd the laurels of the field: her fleets have rode triumphant on the &s;ea&mdash;And <HI>when</HI> or <HI>where</HI> did <HI>you,</HI> my Countrymen, depart inglorious from the field of fight?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Patience with which this People have borne the repeated Injuries which have been heap'd upon them, and their unwillingne&s;s to take any &s;anguinary Mea&s;ures, has very injudiciou&s;ly been a&s;cribed to Cowardice, by Per&s;ons both here and in Great-Britain. I mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h that an Opinion &s;o erroneous in it&s;elf, and &s;o fatal in its con&s;equences, might be utterly removed before it be too late: And I think no|thing <HI>further</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to convince every intelligent Man, that the Conduct of this People is owing to the <HI>tender Regard</HI> which they have for their Fellow Men, and an <HI>utter Abhorrence to the &s;hedding of human Blood, than</HI> a little Attention to their general Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition, di&s;covered when they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be under any Apprehen&s;ion of Danger to them&s;elves.&mdash;I will only mention the univer&s;al Dete&s;tation which they &s;hew to every Act of Cruelty, by whom and upon whom&s;oever committed; the mild Spirit of their Laws; the very few Crimes to which capital Penalties are annexed; and the very great Backwardne&s;s which both Courts and Juries di&s;cover, in condemning Per&s;ons charged with <HI>capital Crimes.</HI>&mdash;But if any &s;hould think this Ob&s;ervation not to the Purpo&s;e, I readily appeal to tho&s;e Gentlemen of the Army who have been in the Camp, or in the Field, with the Americans.</NOTE> <HI>You</HI> too

can &s;hew the trophies of your <HI>forefather</HI>'s victories and your <HI>own</HI>; can name the fortre&s;&s;es and battles you have won; and many of you count the honourable &s;cars of wounds received, whil&s;t &s;ighting for your king and country.</P>
<P>WHERE ju&s;tice is the &s;tandard, Heaven is the warrior's &s;hield&punc; But con&s;cious guilt unnerves the arm that lifts the &s;word again&s;t the innocent. Britain united with the&s;e colonies, by commerce and affection&mdash;by intere&s;t and blood, may mock the threats of France and Spain: May be the &s;eat of univer&s;al empire. But &s;hould America either by <HI>force,</HI> or tho&s;e more dangerous engines, <HI>luxury</HI> and <HI>corrup|tion,</HI> ever be brought into a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, Britain mu&s;t lo&s;e <HI>her</HI> freedom al&s;o. No longer &s;hall &s;he &s;it the <HI>empre&s;s</HI> of the &s;ea:&mdash; Her &s;hips no more &s;hall waft her thunders over the wide ocean:&mdash; The <HI>wreath</HI> &s;hall wither on her temples:&mdash;Her weakened arm &s;hall be unable to defend her coa&s;ts: and &s;he at la&s;t mu&s;t bow her vene|able head to &s;ome proud foreigner's de&s;potic rule.</P>
<P>BUT if from pa&s;t events we may venture to form a judgment of the future, we ju&s;tly may expect that the devices of our enemies will but increa&s;e the triumphs of our country. I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> indulge a hope that <HI>Britain</HI>'s liberty as well as <HI>ours,</HI> will eventually be pre&s;erved by the virtue of America.</P>
<P>THE attempt of the Briti&s;h parliament to rai&s;e a revenue from America, and our denial of their right to do it, have excited an al|mo&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="014608_0019_0F9434423683BBF8">
univer&s;al enquiry into the rights of mankind in general, and of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in particular; the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of which mu&s;t be &s;uch a liberality of &s;entiment, and &s;uch a jealou&s;y of tho&s;e in pow|er as will, better than an adamantine wall, &s;ecure us again&s;t the fu|ture approaches of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>THE malice of the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Port-Bill has been defeated in a very con&s;iderable degree, by giving <HI>you</HI> an opportunity of <HI>de&s;erving,</HI> and <HI>our brethren</HI> in this and our &s;i&s;ter-colonies an opportunity of <HI>be&s;tow|ing</HI> tho&s;e benefactions which have delighted your friends and a&s;to|ni&s;hed your enemies, not only in America, but in Europe al&s;o. And what is more valuable &s;till, the &s;ympathetic feelings for a bro|ther in di&s;tre&s;s, and the grateful emotions excited in the brea&s;t of him who finds relief, mu&s;t forever endear each to the other, and form tho&s;e indi&s;&s;oluble bonds of friend&s;hip and affection, on which the pre&s;ervation of our rights &s;o evidently depend.</P>
<P>THE mutilation of our charter has made every other colony jealous for its own; for <HI>this,</HI> if once &s;ubmitted to by us, would &s;et on float the property and government of every Briti&s;h &s;ettlement upon the continent. If Charters are not deemed &s;acred, how mi&s;e|rably precarious is every thing founded upon them.</P>
<P>EVEN the &s;ending troops to put the&s;e acts in execution is not without advantages to us. The exactne&s;s and beauty of their Di&s;|cipline in&s;pire our youth with ardor in the pur&s;uit of military knowledge. Charles the <HI>Invicible,</HI> taught Peter the <HI>Great,</HI> the

art of war. The battle of Pultowa convinced Charles of the pro|ficiency Peter had made.</P>
<P>OUR Country is in danger, but not to be de&s;paired of. Our enemies are numerous and powerful&mdash;but we have many friends, determine to BE FREE, and Heaven and Earth will aid the RESOLUTION. On <HI>you</HI> depend the fortunes of America. <HI>You</HI> are to decide the important que&s;tion, on which re&s;t the happine&s;s and liberty of millions yet un|born. Act worthy of your&s;elves. The faltering tongue of hoary age calls on you to &s;upport your country. The li&s;ping infant rai&s;es its &s;uppliant hands, imploring defence again&s;t the mon&s;ter &s;lavery. Your fathers look from their caele&s;tial &s;eats with &s;miling approba|tion on their &s;ons, who boldly &s;tand forth in the cau&s;e of virtue; but &s;ternly frown upon the inhuman mi&s;creant, who, to &s;ecure the loaves and fi&s;hes to him&s;elf, would breed a &s;erpent to de&s;troy his children.</P>
<P>BUT, pardon me, my fellow-citizens, I know you want not zeal Or fortitude. You will maintain your rights or peri&s;h in the gene|rous &s;truggle. However difficult the combat, you never will decline it when freedom is the prize. An independence on Great-Britain is not our aim. No, our wi&s;h is, that Britain and the Colonies may like the oak and ivy, grow and increa&s;e in &s;trength together. But whil&s;t the infatuated plan of making one part of the empire &s;laves to the other, is per&s;i&s;ted in; the intere&s;t and &s;afety of <HI>Britain,</HI> as well as the <HI>Colonies,</HI> require that the wi&s;e mea&s;ures recommended by the honourable, the continental Congre&s;s, be &s;teadily pur&s;ued; whereby

the unnatural conte&s;t between a parent honoured, and a child beloved, may probably be brought to &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue, as that the peace and hap|pine&s;s of both, may be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a la&s;ting ba&s;is. But if the&s;e pacific mea&s;ures are ineffectual, and it appears that the only way to &s;afety is, thro' fields of blood, I know you will not turn your faces from your foes; but will undauntedly pre&s;s forward, until tyranny is trodden under foot, and you have fixed your adored godde&s;s LIBERTY, fa&s;t by a BRUNSWICK's &s;ide, on the American Throne.</P>
<P>YOU <HI>then,</HI> who nobly have e&s;pou&s;ed your Country's cau&s;e, who generou&s;ly have &s;acrificed wealth and ca&s;e&mdash;<HI>who</HI> have de&s;pi&s;ed the pomp and &s;hew of tin&s;el'd greatne&s;s&mdash;refu&s;ed the &s;ummons to the fe&s;tive board, been deaf to the alluring calls of luxury and mirth, <HI>who</HI> have for&s;aken the downy pillow, to keep your vigils by the midnight lamp, for the &s;alvation of your invaded country, that you might break the fowler's &s;nare, and di&s;appoint the vulture of his prey, <HI>you</HI> then will reap that harve&s;t of renown which you &s;o ju&s;tly have de&s;erved.
