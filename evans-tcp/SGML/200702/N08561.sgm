<P>THE Author of the following &s;heets is not ambitious of appearing in print. From this, the bu&s;ine&s;s of his profe&s;&s;ion, and a &s;en&s;e of his own inability, are &s;uf|ficient di&s;couragements. But his affection for the colonies more particularly traduced in his lord&s;hip's &s;ermon, and his greater regard for truth, induced him to become an advocate for injured innocence. While writing the letter, he had no thoughts of prefixing his name: But con&s;idering &s;ince, that facts a&s;&s;erted by a namele&s;s writer, cannot make their appearance in public with the &s;ame degree of credi|bility, as when the a&s;&s;ertor can be called upon for his vouchers, he conceived it his duty, in the mo&s;t public man|ner, to e&s;pou&s;e what he thought it his duty to make public. If after all his caution to be rightly informed, he &s;hould be &s;o unhappy as to be mi&s;taken in any the mo&s;t immaterial circum&s;tances, he will acknowledge him&s;elf under obliga|tions to the friendly hand that points out his error. This however, he promi&s;es, on condition that the per&s;on di&s;co|vering his mi&s;take, does it with decency and temper; and is not a&s;hamed to di&s;cover his own name. Every anonymous piece he &s;hall accordingly treat with neglect; and if defa|matory or virulent, which is but too much the pre&s;ent mode of writing, he &s;hall treat it, as all &s;uch writings de&s;erve, &mdash;with contempt.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter to the Bi&s;hop of LAN|DAFF.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ON reading Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s appeal to the public, in behalf of the church of En|gland in America, I met with a long quotation in favour of an American epi&s;copate, from a &s;ermon preach'd by your lord&s;hip before <HI>the incorporated &s;ociety, for the propagation of the go&s;|pel in foreign parts,</HI> at their anniver&s;ary meeting in the pari&s;h church of St. Mary-le-Bow, on the 20th of February, 1767. This rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity to procure the &s;ermon it&s;elf; and your lord&s;hip will pardon me for &s;aying, that the peru&s;al of it excited at once my indig|nation and &s;orrow;&mdash;my indignation, that any man &s;hould &s;o gro&s;sly have abu&s;ed your lord&s;hip's confidence in his veracity, by the mo&s;t unparallelled mi&s;repre&s;en|tation of facts; and my &s;orrow, that a per&s;on of your lord&s;hip's good &s;en&s;e and di&s;tingui&s;hed character, &s;hould have placed any confidence in &s;o impudent an informer. For indeed, my lord, I que&s;tion whether there be a pamphlet in the nation, that in proportion to the length of the &s;ermon, contains &s;o great a number of aberrations
<PB N="2" REF="010948_0004_0F8530EF56724EB0">
from the truth. And as the facts alledged are extremely injurious to the characters of men, and many of them, to the memory of the mo&s;t excellent per&s;ons decea&s;ed, (whom we have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, have, long &s;ince, received the approbation of their and your lord&s;hip's final judge) whoever abu&s;ed your lord&s;hip's credulity, is on this account, the more inexcu&s;ably cul|pable. How far your lord&s;hip is your&s;elf to blame, for preaching and publi&s;hing &s;o many intere&s;ting facts, on &s;uch incompetent te&s;timony as your lord&s;hip has relied on, I will not pre&s;ume to determine. This how|ever, I think I may venture to &s;ay without offence, that as the charges adduced by your lord&s;hip, affect the reputation of great numbers of his maje&s;ty's loyal &s;ubjects in the&s;e colonies, proportionable deliberation and pains were nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;tigate the truth. And tho' the mo&s;t &s;edulous and impartial inquirer may be deceived by mi&s;information; yet in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it was &s;o ea&s;y a matter to have attained to the utmo&s;t certainty, that directly the rever&s;e of many a&s;&s;ertions in your lord&s;hip's &s;ermon was true; that it is not a little &s;urprizing your lord&s;hip &s;hould have &s;uffered your&s;elf to have been &s;o palpably mi&s;led. And if a prelate of your lord&s;hip's abilities and candour, was &s;o unhappily induced to <HI>take up an ill report again&s;t your neighbour,</HI> from the mouth or pen of &s;ome malicious deceiver, how much ea&s;ier may we imagine, will a misjudging and cen|&s;orious world adopt, what has been preached and printed by &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a per&s;onage as the <HI>bi&s;hop of Landaff.</HI> It cannot therefore, I humbly pre&s;ume, be deemed officious or impertinent, in vindication of the characters &s;o unju&s;tly defamed in your lord&s;hip's &s;ermon, to remove tho&s;e prejudices you have unfortunately imbibed; or to prevent their being farther diffu&s;ed, and more deeply
<PB N="3" REF="010948_0005_0F8530F011A64F80">
rivetted, by a di&s;cour&s;e, which from the dignity of its author, mu&s;t naturally carry great weight, and make very durable impre&s;&s;ions. And it appears truly won|derful to me, that among&s;t the great numbers in this country, who are capable of performing this benevolent ta&s;k, not one that I know of, except <HI>Dr. Chauncey</HI> of Bo&s;ton (to whom I am obliged for &s;everal facts and ob&s;ervations) hath hitherto attempted it. The pa&s;&s;ages in your &s;ermon, my lord, which I would be under&s;tood to have particularly in view, are tho&s;e which relate to the American colonies. Your lord&s;hip &s;ays, page 6, <Q>Since the di&s;covery of the new world, the &s;ame provi|&s;ion hath not been made of mini&s;ters, nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of chri&s;tianity among tho&s;e who removed thi|ther, e&s;pecially in the Briti&s;h colonies.</Q>
This, my lord, affirmed of the colonies without di&s;crimination, is &s;o contrary to truth, that with re&s;pect to many of them, they exceed perhaps in &s;uch provi&s;ion, every other part of the chri&s;tian world. In the <HI>New-England</HI> colonies particularly, they have from their earlie&s;t &s;ettlement been peculiarly attentive to the mo&s;t ample provi&s;ion of a go&s;pel mini&s;try. Their legi&s;lative acts, from the com|mencement of tho&s;e colonies, abundantly evince this attention. By the&s;e provi&s;ion is always made for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upport of the go&s;pel mini&s;try in every new-erected town&s;hip; and without &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment, within three years from the &s;ettlement, the grants are liable to an ab&s;olute forfeiture. In con&s;equence of this provi&s;ion, with the divine ble&s;&s;ing on their pious endea|vours, chri&s;tianity has not only been &s;upported, but &s;o faithfully preached, and &s;o zealou&s;ly inculcated, that I will venture to affirm, there is not a more virtuous, not a more religious people upon the face of the earth. In|deed, my lord, from the mo&s;t authentic accounts re&s;pec|ting
<PB N="4" REF="010948_0006_0F8530F0E020D698">
the &s;tate of religion in England, I have rea&s;on to think, they &s;urpa&s;s both in the theory and practice of chri&s;tianity, tho&s;e who have the advantage of enjoying it under the &s;upports of a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment, and are perpetually ba&s;king in the full &s;un&s;hine of epi&s;copal pre-eminence. Nay, I doubt not your lord&s;hip will readily admit, that notwith&s;tanding the millions expended on the dignitaries of the church, and the boa&s;ted advantage of epi&s;copal ordination, the people of England do not out&s;hine in purity of morals, either the prote&s;tant can|tons of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> the republic of <HI>Holland,</HI> or the church of <HI>Scotland</HI>; all which however know nothing about epi&s;copacy, except, as the&s;e colonies, I mean, at a convenient and comfortable di&s;tance. And though re|crimination, my lord, is reputed to be ju&s;t; yet it is &s;o very di&s;agreeable, that I &s;hall not attempt to heighten the lu&s;tre of the lives and examples of the New-England clergy, by the foil of tho&s;e in the mother country. Let it &s;uffice to inform your lord&s;hip, as what may be depen|ded upon for matter of fact, that there are now within the bounds of New-England, not le&s;s than five hundred and fifty mini&s;ters, &s;ome of the pre&s;byterian, but the greater part of the congregational per&s;ua&s;ion, regularly &s;et apart to the pa&s;toral charge of as many chri&s;tian con|gregations, having been previou&s;ly qualified with divine and human literature in the cour&s;e of a liberal education, at &s;ome of their colleges. They are moreover, men of irreproachable lives, and orthodox in principle, who di&s;charge their &s;acred function in a manner that does honour to the holy religion they profe&s;s. And can it be &s;aid, my lord, with the lea&s;t appearance of truth, of &s;uch a country as this, (a country &s;o thinly inhabited, and &s;o recently emerging out of a &s;tate of political non|exi&s;tence) that it has <Q>not made a provi&s;ion of mini&s;ters
<PB N="5" REF="010948_0007_0F8530F19712AD60">
nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of chri&s;tianity?</Q>
In truth, my lord, however the people of Britain, may, on ac|count of their remote &s;ituation from us, be prevailed on to credit &s;uch marvellous reports, the North-Americans could not be more a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;hould your lord&s;hip a&s;&s;ert, that this part of the world is not inhabited by any of the human &s;pecies, but only by <HI>Satyrs,</HI> and <HI>Cen|taurs,</HI> and <HI>Griffins.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR lord&s;hip proceeds, <Q>A &s;candalous neglect (to wit, this of not making provi&s;ion for mini&s;ters) which hath brought great and de&s;erved reproach both on the adventurers, and on the government whence they went, and under who&s;e protection and power they &s;till remained in their new habitations.</Q>
To convince your lord&s;hip, by an induction of particulars, that the&s;e colonies have of late indeed felt the <HI>power</HI> of the coun|try whence they emigrated, would oblige me to protract this letter to an inexcu&s;able length. A great part of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, the Briti&s;h parliament, and his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters in particular, have exhibited recent proofs, by removing &s;ome of our complaints again&s;t an undue exertion of power, that it had made us feel but <HI>too great</HI> a proportion of it. I am &s;orry, my lord, that &s;o few of the right reverend bench concurred with them in &s;entiment. But with re&s;pect to the <HI>protection</HI> which the mother country hath afforded us, your lord&s;hip has no rea&s;on to triumph. Many of the colonies were not only &s;ettled without her protection, but by rea&s;on of her per&s;ecution and intollerance. The emigrants fled from her, into the wilds of America, to find an a&s;ylum from tho&s;e u&s;urpations over the con&s;ciences of men; which it will be an eternal blemi&s;h on her character, that &s;he &s;o wantonly exerci&s;ed. After having for&s;aken hou&s;es and lands, and the mo&s;t tender connections, with every
<PB N="6" REF="010948_0008_0F8530F253C02AE8">
thing dear and e&s;timable among&s;t human kind, for the undi&s;turbed fruition of the rights of private judgment, &s;acred by the laws of God and of nature, they had to encounter, without the protection of the government, the &s;anguinary &s;avages of the de&s;art, with all tho&s;e un&s;peakable difficulties of &s;ettling a new world in a how|ling wilderne&s;s; which nothing but an inflexible tru&s;t in God, and the mo&s;t infrangible re&s;olution of adhering to their religious principles, could ever have &s;urmounted. A character this, my lord, that will, in the opinion of all impartial men, make a brighter figure in hi&s;tory, than can po&s;&s;ibly be acquired by haranguing on the excel|lency of chri&s;tianity from the downy couch of &s;ecurity and ea&s;e; or recommending the propagation of it among the pagans, the orator the mean while, remaining at the &s;alutary di&s;tance of three thou&s;and miles from the &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>YOUR lord&s;hip proceeds in the following words. <Q>To the adventurers, what reproach could be ca&s;t hea|vier than what they de&s;erv'd? Who, with their native &s;oil, abandoned their native manners and religion; and er'e long were found in many parts without re|membrance or knowledge of God, without any divine wor&s;hip, in di&s;&s;olute wickedne&s;s, and the mo&s;t brutal profligacy of manners. In&s;tead of civilizing and converting barbarous infidels, as they undertook to do, they became them&s;elves infidels and barbarians. And is it not &s;ome aggravation of their &s;hame, that this their neglect of religion was contrary to the pre|tences and conditions under which they obtained royal grants, and public authority to their adventures? The pretences and conditions were, that their de&s;ign was, and that they &s;hould endeavour the enlargement of commerce, and the propagation of chri&s;tian faith.
<PB N="7" REF="010948_0009_0F8530F3240ABAF8">
The former they excuted with &s;incerity and zeal; and in the latter mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly failed.</Q>
&mdash;While rumi|nating, my lord, on tho&s;e &s;triking words, <Q>living with|out remembrance or knowledge of God, without any divine wor&s;hip, in di&s;&s;olute wickedne&s;s, and the mo&s;t brutal profligacy of manners!</Q>
I am almo&s;t tempted to think, that your lord&s;hip hath mi&s;taken &s;ome hi&s;tory of the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> for that of <HI>New-England.</HI> Indeed, I have no conception that the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pencil is capable of drawing a more hideous picture of human nature: Nor do I think that even the Hottentots them&s;elves, if we may credit the more modern travel|lers, are &s;unk into &s;uch an amazing depth of depravity and pollution. Bating the article of <HI>divine wor&s;hip,</HI> I never heard of a people, whom your lord&s;hip's picture more &s;trongly re&s;embles, than &s;ome of the epi&s;copal clergy in the province of Maryland, and the We&s;t-India i&s;lands; but for them al&s;o, it is rather too high-wrought, and coloured beyond the life. Your lord&s;hip, 'tis true, has not been plea&s;ed in direct terms, to tell us in what parts the adventurers were thus irreligious, di&s;&s;olute, brutal, and beyond all parallel profligate in their man|ners: But by certain di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;trokes in this deep-&s;haded and di&s;mal portrait, it is &s;ufficiently evident, that your lord&s;hip intends the adventurers who &s;ettled <HI>New-England.</HI> This I collect from the following words in the paragraph under con&s;ideration.&mdash; <Q>Their not civilizing and converting the barbarous infidels, as they <HI>undertook to do</HI>:</Q>
And this in contrariety <Q>to the <HI>pretences</HI> and <HI>conditions</HI> under which they obtained <HI>royal grants</HI>;</Q>
and in a word, their implicative decla|ration by tho&s;e pretences and conditions, that <Q><HI>their</HI>
de&s;ign was, <HI>and that</HI> they would endeavour the propa|gation of the chri&s;tian faith.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010948_0010_0F8530F56946AA68">As I cannot find, my lord, that any incorporated company of adventurers to America, entered into the engagements mentioned by your lord&s;hip, or obtained any charter on &s;uch condition, except tho&s;e who fixed their re&s;idence in New-England; I mu&s;t conclude tho&s;e were the emigrants, to whom your lord&s;hip more par|ticularly alludes. I therefore take it for granted, it is again&s;t <HI>them,</HI> that your lord&s;hip has preferred the heavy accu&s;ation, of <HI>abandoning with their native &s;oil, their native manners and religion,</HI> &amp;c. It is certainly to be pre&s;umed, my lord, that you was not per&s;onally acquainted with any adventurers who died an hundred years before your lord&s;hip was born. Nor from any hi&s;tory of that people, could &s;o di&s;gu&s;tful a de&s;cription be collected, there being no account of them extant, but what does honour to their moral and religious character. Nay, my lord, &s;o far from de&s;erving to have their memories &s;tig|matized with &s;o uncommon a brand of infamy, that they were remarkable for all the oppo&s;ite virtues. In|&s;tead of <HI>living without the remembrance or knowledge of God,</HI> they maintained a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of the deity, to whom, for his pre&s;ervation of them amid&s;t the perils of the great deep, and their deliverance out of the hands of their per&s;ecutors, they conceived them&s;elves under renewed and additional obligations. Their lives were &s;uitable to tho&s;e devout &s;entiments. In&s;tead of living <HI>without divine wor&s;hip,</HI> their fir&s;t care was to found churches, to found colleges for a learned go&s;pel mini&s;try, and to frame laws for the &s;upport of the public wor&s;hip of God. Nor have tho&s;e colonies from their fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment to this day, been without provincial laws, to enforce an attendance on public wor&s;hip, and puni&s;h the profanation of the &s;abbath. Laws religiou&s;ly ob|&s;erved, and not wantonly violated, as in London, where
<PB N="9" REF="010948_0011_0F8530F61A5CA840">
the lord's-day is le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hable by a proportionate appearance of religion, than a partial depopulation of the city, di&s;gorging her myriads to revel in the coun|try, and &s;pend that con&s;ecrated portion of time, (to borrow your lord&s;hip's expre&s;&s;ive, and in this place, mo&s;t appo&s;ite language, in more than mere di&s;&s;ipation even) <HI>in di&s;&s;olute wickedne&s;s.</HI> So far from being <HI>di&s;&s;o|lutely wicked,</HI> that they were remarkable not only for their &s;obriety, temperance, cha&s;tity and gravity, but moreover for a kind of preci&s;ion and rigidne&s;s of man|ners, very prevalent in the nation at the time of their departure; but which king Charles the &s;econd, and his profligate courtiers &s;oon laughed out of it; and together with it, a great deal of real and &s;ub&s;tantial piety, which all the Engli&s;h clergy, with their united efforts, have not been able hitherto to re&s;tore to the &s;ame flouri&s;hing and vigorous condition. With re&s;pect to their <HI>brutal profligacy of manners</HI>; the charge, my lord, is &s;o gro&s;s, and the contrary &s;o univer&s;ally known to be true, that an attempt to refute it, after what has already been &s;aid (and for which I vouch every hi&s;tory of that people) would be a manife&s;t mi&s;pending of your lord&s;hip's time. You cannot, my lord, require, that we &s;hould tran&s;mit depo&s;itions from hence, to prove, that the &s;un &s;hines in America as well as in Europe. And yet it is not more notorious to all this part of the continent, that the people to who&s;e memories your lord&s;hip has been &s;o injurious, did, in fact, de&s;erve the above amiable and excellent character, than that we enjoy the light of that glorious luminary. Nay, in a matter &s;o generally known, it were a &s;trange ta&s;k to be obliged to adduce particular te&s;timony. It would be like the hard&s;hip complained of by archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> in his &s;ermon again&s;t <HI>tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, that it might well &s;eem &s;trange if any man
<PB N="10" REF="010948_0012_0F8530F6CCFF54E0">
&s;hould write a book, to prove that an egg is not an elephant, and that a mu&s;ket bullet is not a pike.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as your lord&s;hip has neither acquired this intelli|gence by per&s;onal acquaintance, nor hi&s;torical informa|tion, I can conceive of no &s;ource from whence it could &s;o probably have been drawn, as that of the &s;ociety's mi&s;&s;ionaries. And believe me, my lord, if you make u&s;e of no other channel of conveyance, your lord&s;hip will but too &s;eldom be ju&s;tly informed. This declara|tion mu&s;t naturally appear &s;o har&s;h and uncharitable, that I think my&s;elf obliged to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on on which it is grounded. I will, my lord, a&s;&s;ign two. In the fir&s;t place, many of tho&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries, in their accounts re&s;pecting their mi&s;&s;ion, have for many years pa&s;t, made it a practice to mi&s;repre&s;ent facts. And &s;econdly, it being their intere&s;t &s;o to do, a moderate &s;hare of the knowledge of mankind, will be &s;ufficient to induce us to con&s;ider as incompetent witne&s;&s;es, any &s;et of men who are per&s;onally intere&s;ted in the te&s;timony they deliver.</P>
<P>But in what &s;en&s;e, my lord, did tho&s;e adventurers <HI>abandon their native religion?</HI> If your lord&s;hip means by their <HI>native religion,</HI> the doctrines of chri&s;tianity as contained in the thirty-nine articles of <HI>your church</HI>; they were &s;o far from abandoning it, that it were to be wi&s;hed it had been as inviolably pre&s;erved by tho&s;e whom they left behind them. The&s;e were the very doctrines which they, in their time, univer&s;ally believed, con&s;tantly taught, and warmly inculcated. The&s;e are the doctrines which their po&s;terity, to this day, believe, teach, and inculcate. Nay, they believe, teach and inculcate them, in the &s;ame &s;criptural and unadulterated &s;en&s;e, in which they were believed, taught and inculcated at the time of the reformation. They believe, teach, and incul|cate them, without tho&s;e &s;ophi&s;ticating glo&s;&s;es, by which
<PB N="11" REF="010948_0013_0F8530FA03CA69C8">
they have &s;ince, in the mother-country, been wre&s;ted to favour the here&s;y of <HI>Arminius</HI>; which your lord&s;hip well knows was not their native &s;en&s;e; and con&s;equently, as far as the Engli&s;h clergy do now pervert them to any &s;uch meaning; &s;o far have <HI>they</HI>
<Q>abandoned their native religion.</Q>
And if there be any among the <HI>de&s;cendants</HI>
of tho&s;e adventurers, who have, in this &s;en&s;e, I mean in a perver&s;ion of tho&s;e articles, abandoned their <HI>native religion,</HI> they generally happen, I know not by what fatality, to be members of the <HI>epi&s;copal churches.</HI> Few, my lord, very few of any other denominations among&s;t us, have hitherto profe&s;&s;ed that wonderful dexterity in taylor&s;hip, of making <HI>robes of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>garments of &s;alvation,</HI> out of&mdash;<HI>filthy rags.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR lord&s;hip's charge, is certainly &s;o groundle&s;s, that there never was a people in the world, who have been more a&s;&s;iduous in pre&s;erving their <HI>native religion,</HI> and in tran&s;mitting it, pure and incorrupt, to their po&s;te|rity. If catechi&s;ms are conducive to this end, they have publi&s;hed as judicious and elaborate ones as any part of the prote&s;tant world hath ever produced. Let any impartial man read their productions of this kind; a le&s;&s;er and a larger one by <HI>Mr. Norton,</HI> the like by <HI>Mr. Mather,</HI> &s;everal by <HI>Mr. Cotton,</HI> one by <HI>Mr. Davenport,</HI> one by <HI>Mr. Stone,</HI> one by <HI>Mr. Norris,</HI> one by <HI>Mr. Noyes,</HI> one by <HI>Mr. Fi&s;k,</HI> &s;everal by <HI>Mr. Elliot,</HI> one by <HI>Mr. Sea-Born Cotton,</HI> and a large one by <HI>Mr. Fitch</HI>; and then let him &s;ay, whether true divinity was ever better handled; or whether they were not the mo&s;t genuine &s;ons of the church of England, who thus maintained her fundamental articles: Articles, &s;o often &s;ub&s;cribed, and afterwards denied, by &s;ome who are mo&s;t prompt to monopolize that name to them&s;elves. Have eccle&s;i|a&s;tical councils any tendency this way? I find one at

The re&s;olutions of the latter, my lord, are comprized in a work of great theological erudition; and which required a little more towards its compo&s;ition, than the &s;kill of con&s;truing a chapter in the Greek te&s;tament, or reading a &s;ermon of another man's writing, <HI>a la mode D'Angleterre.</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ynods or con-&s;ociations have ever &s;ince been in u&s;e among them; and what may appear extraordinary to an Engli&s;h prelate, they have been &s;o conducted as never to give any ju&s;t umbrage to the civil power.</P>
<P>BUT if your lord&s;hip means by <HI>their native religion,</HI> an implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to eccle&s;ia&s;tico-political power arbitrarily a&s;&s;umed, and tyrannically exerci&s;ed; or, a recognition of any man on earth, as &s;upreme head of the chri&s;tian church, in derogation of the tran&s;cendent authority of him, <HI>to whom angels and authorities, and powers are made &s;ubject</HI>; or a &s;uper&s;titious attachment to rights and ceremonies of human invention, to the neglect of vital piety and purity of heart; it is agreed, my lord, that in this &s;en&s;e, they did in good earne&s;t <HI>abandon their native religion</HI>; and 'tis devoutly to be wi&s;hed, their po&s;terity may never be &s;o infatuated as to re&s;ume it.</P>

of being greatly in&s;trumental in advancing the Briti&s;h empire in America, to an unrival'd degree of extent, power and opulence. Nay, of the &s;till &s;uperior and more ine&s;timable good, of pre&s;erving among&s;t their progeny, that pure and undefiled religion, which in the land of their nativity, hath, &s;ince their emigration, to your lord&s;hip's certain knowledge, &s;uffered &s;o lament|able a declen&s;ion. After having thus, my lord, had the honour of &s;o largely contributing towards the aug|mentation and grandeur of his maje&s;ty's dominions; after the many illu&s;trious proofs of ri&s;ing &s;uperior to the mo&s;t di&s;couraging ob&s;tacles; and &s;urmounting perils, and want, and toil, and famine, and the &s;word of the wilderne&s;s, when they had but to return to their native &s;oil, to be re&s;tored to all the comforts and delights of life; would they have con&s;ented (about what the generality of men, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e in que&s;t of pre|ferment, make no long deliberation) to &s;acrifice their con&s;ciences to their temporal intere&s;t!&mdash;After &s;uch &s;ignal interpo&s;itions of heaven,&mdash;&s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible mani|fe&s;tations of the finger of God in their behalf;&mdash;and, after having left behind them &s;uch a &s;weet memorial, &s;uch a more than brazen monument, of the &s;incerity of their profe&s;&s;ion: After all this, I &s;ay, it might have been hoped, my lord, that their a&s;hes at lea&s;t &s;hould have remained undi&s;turbed; nor their memories been traduced with reproaches, greater perhaps, than were ever de&s;erved by the mo&s;t flagitious of mankind. Sorry am I therefore, &s;orry on your lord&s;hip's account, as well as from the veneration I bear to their memory, that a prelate of the church of England, in the&s;e boa&s;ted times of moderation and candour, at the di&s;tance of more than a century, and for the &s;ingle crime of (what by far the greater part of prote&s;tant chri&s;tendom, is

deemed no crime at all) non-conformity to the epi&s;copal mode of church government, &s;hould pur&s;ue them, even beyond the grave, with a &s;pirit &s;o apparently vindictive, and with &s;uch unu&s;ual a&s;perity and virulence of language.</P>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this head, my lord, with ob&s;erving, that had I met with the terms <HI>native religion,</HI> in the works of an author of inferior name, I &s;hould have been apt to he&s;itate about their propriety. I have often heard of a man's <HI>native country,</HI> as &s;ignifying that in which he is born: But as no man is born <HI>in,</HI> or <HI>with,</HI> any religion, I &s;hall for the future, in adopting that mode of expre&s;|&s;ion, think it prudent to avail my&s;elf of (what no critic will perhaps pre&s;ume to controvert) your lord&s;hip's authority and example.</P>
<P>YOUR lord&s;hip proceeds by &s;aying, that, <Q>in&s;tead of civilizing and converting barbarous infidels, as they undertook to do, they became them&s;elves infidels and barbarians; and that it was &s;ome aggravation of their &s;hame, that this their neglect of religion was contrary to the pretences and conditions, under which they obtained royal grants, and public authority to their adventures.</Q>
Had you levelled this charge, my lord, again&s;t that venerable body before whom your lord&s;hip delivered the &s;ermon in que&s;tion, they would doubtle&s;s have complained of the accu&s;ation: And yet with re&s;pect to their endeavours, in <HI>civilizing and con|verting barbarous infidels,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e will be allowed to be part of the grand de&s;ign of their incorporation, I will venture to affirm, that they have been more defi|cient than the adventurers upon whom your lord&s;hip is plea&s;ed to fix the charge. If by <Q>the propagation of the go&s;pel in foreign parts,</Q>
is to be under&s;tood the epi&s;copi&s;ing of di&s;&s;enters in the American colonies;
<PB N="15" REF="010948_0017_0F8530FCED4979B0">
they have indeed made &s;ome attempts towards it. But how the preaching of the go&s;pel, by their mi&s;&s;ionaries, in places in which it was preached, before either the &s;ociety or their mi&s;&s;ionaries had a being, can be called <HI>civilizing and converting barbarous infidels,</HI> I leave your lord&s;hip and the whole world to judge. What barba|rians, my lord, have they civilized? What infidels have they converted? The immen&s;e &s;ums expended by the venerable &s;ociety, are not laid out in mi&s;&s;ions among&s;t the native pagans, who know not <HI>the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he hath &s;ent:</HI> They are &s;quandered, ridiculou&s;ly &s;quandered on mi&s;&s;ions to places where the go&s;pel was preached, and, (admitting the articles of the church of England, as the &s;tandard of orthodoxy) more faithfully preached before. This, my lord, however people at home may be mendicated or &s;ermonized out of their money, is &s;o notorious here, that an attempt to adduce proofs to evince it, would be like holding a candle to the &s;un. Nor are they generally &s;ent, even into tho&s;e interior &s;ettlements, in which people are more de&s;titute of the means of grace; but into &s;uch, where they are mo&s;t amply provided with them. In &s;hort, my lord, if the original de&s;ign of the &s;ociety, in their mi&s;&s;ions to tho&s;e parts of America, was, as before ob&s;erved, to pro&s;elyte di&s;&s;enters to epi&s;copacy; they have executed it with a con&s;iderable degree of a&s;&s;iduity; and the pay hath undoubtedly been more than the purcha&s;e. But if it was to chri&s;tianize aboriginal indians; or to &s;ub&s;erve the cau&s;e of chri&s;tianity in any other &s;en&s;e, except as abovementioned, <HI>they</HI> have; (with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and reverence be it &s;poken) <HI>notoriou&s;ly failed.</HI> Or &s;hould it be in&s;i&s;ted upon, that the principal de&s;ign of the &s;ociety is not to chri&s;tianize indians; but to maintain the public wor&s;hip of God among our own people in
<PB N="16" REF="010948_0018_0F8530FD8D1DDD48">
the American plantations; it will appear, from a &s;urvey of great part of Maryland and Virginia, the true &s;tate of which, from their con&s;tant commercial intercour&s;e with Great Britain, cannot be a &s;ecret, that in the execution of this part of their de&s;ign, they have been extremely delinquent.</P>
<P>MAY I now entreat your Lord&s;hip's patience, while I recount, by way of contra&s;t, &s;ome of the attempts of tho&s;e adventurers and their po&s;terity, in the execution of the laudable purpo&s;e of <HI>civilizing and converting barbarous infidels.</HI></P>
<P>IT appears by a &s;ermon of <HI>Dr. Cotton Mather,</HI> printed in the year 1698, that there were then in the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, more than thirty indian a&s;&s;emblies, for religious wor&s;hip; and above three thou|&s;and chri&s;tian indians. <Q>The &s;acred books of the old and new te&s;tament, were, in their day, by the &s;kill and labour of the indefatigable <HI>Elliot,</HI> tran&s;lated into the indian language; and di&s;per&s;ed among the natives for their in&s;truction in things pertaining to the kingdom of God and of Chri&s;t. For this purpo&s;e, he made him&s;elf fir&s;t acquainted with their language; when thus accompli&s;hed, he preached to them in their own tongue, and in many of their villages; and by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, on his diligent endeavours, many believed and turned to the lord. He &s;oon had &s;everal companions, and afterwards &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who were faithful and zealous in in&s;tructing the&s;e &s;avages in the go&s;pel-method of &s;alvation. Schools were erected among them, and &s;uch books put into their hands, in their native language, as their edification called for. The con&s;equence was, that in &s;everal villages, indians met together every lord's-day, for the wor&s;hip of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and churches of them
<PB N="17" REF="010948_0019_0F8530FE574C9980">
were gathered, who walked in the fear of the lord, and the religious ob&s;ervation of all go&s;pel ordinances. To the bible, Mr. Elliot added, a ver&s;ion of the p&s;alms in indian metre; which it was their practice to &s;ing. This indian bible is the only one that was ever printed in this hemi&s;phere of the univer&s;e.</Q>
After being made acquainted with the above facts, I doubt not, if your lord&s;hip's &s;ermon &s;hould ever be re-printed, you will at lea&s;t think it proper, to except that worthy and venerable &s;ervant of God, Mr. <HI>Elliot,</HI> out of the number of tho&s;e, who, <Q>in&s;tead of civilizing and converting barbarous infidels, became them&s;elves <HI>infidels</HI> and <HI>barbarians.</HI></Q>
For my part, I cannot but think, that the laborious work of learning an indian language; of tran&s;lating the holy &s;criptures into that language, and of &s;pending one's life among&s;t &s;avages, inevitably &s;ubject from their manner of living to innu|merable inconveniences, for the benevolent purpo&s;e of in&s;tructing them in the chri&s;tian religion, ju&s;tly merits a note of approbation, from the pen of a chri&s;tian bi&s;hop. Could any of the &s;ociety's mi&s;&s;ionaries, my lord, boa&s;t &s;o illu&s;trious an in&s;tance of labour, fatigue, patience, and &s;elf-denial; in what &s;plendid and glowing colours might we not expect to find it immortalized; when their u&s;ual exploits of baptizing a few infants or negroes, which might have been done by others at le&s;s than a tenth part of the expence, or the reading a borrowed &s;ermon, to per&s;ons in the full enjoyment of all go&s;pel ordinances, is annually celebrated with notable o&s;tenta|tion and applau&s;e; to the great con&s;umption of the paper manufactory, and the no &s;mall effu&s;ion of epi&s;|copal ink!</P>
<P>WHAT follows, my lord, is extracted from the rev. Mr. Thomas Prince's general account of the Engli&s;h
<PB N="18" REF="010948_0020_0F8530FF950E51E0">
mini&s;ters, who re&s;ided at Martha's Vineyard. <Q>Mr. Thomas Mayhew, &s;on of an excellent man of this name, began, in another part of the province, the work of go&s;peli&s;ing the infidel-natives, &s;o far back, as 1642. And this good work, has been carried on by one and another of this name and family, from that day to this. In 1657, many hundred <HI>indian</HI> men and women, were added to the chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, in this part of the country, of &s;uch as might be &s;aid to be "<HI>holy in their conver&s;ation</HI>;" and that did not need for knowledge, to be taught, "<HI>the fir&s;t principles of the oracles of God</HI>;" be&s;ides many hundreds of more &s;uperficial profe&s;&s;ors. In the year 1689, the <HI>indian</HI>
church, under the care of Mr. John Mayhew, &s;on of the above Thomas, con&s;i&s;ted of an hundred commu|nicants, walking according to the rule of the &s;crip|tures.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall now, my lord, beg leave to lay before your lord&s;hip, an hi&s;torical quotation from Dr. <HI>Chauncey</HI>'s remarks, on certain pa&s;&s;ages in your lord&s;hip's &s;ermon. <Q>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Experience Mayhew,</HI> &s;on of the before mentioned <HI>John,</HI> and father of the late memorable <HI>Dr. Mayhew,</HI> a gentleman of &s;uch &s;uperior natural endowments, that he would, had he been favoured with common advantages, been ranked among the fir&s;t worthies of New-England; and who &s;pent a life protracted &s;everal years beyond eighty, in the &s;ervice of the indians, publi&s;hed in the year 1727, an octavo volume, entitled, <HI>Indian Converts</HI>; in which he has given an account of the lives of thirty <HI>indian</HI> mini&s;ters, and above eighty <HI>indian</HI> men, women, and young per&s;ons, within the limits only of Martha's Vineyard, an i&s;land in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts province. And of the&s;e, as he was a gentleman of e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation,
<PB N="19" REF="010948_0021_0F8530FFD35CC1B0">
for both judgment and veracity, it may be charitably &s;aid, they were all real converts, to the faith of Chri&s;t, and &s;ome of them in a di&s;tingui&s;hing degree, clearly evidenced by their manner of life; which was &s;uch, as may make many Engli&s;h profe&s;&s;ors blu&s;h, of whom it may be hoped, that they are chri&s;tians in truth, as well as name. In the <HI>atte&s;tation</HI> to this account, &s;igned by eleven Bo&s;ton mini&s;ters, &s;ome of whom are now alive,
it is &s;aid, <Q>that they who may ignorantly and imperiou&s;ly &s;ay, nothing has been done, may be confuted; and that they, who are de&s;irous to &s;ee &s;omething that has been done, may be entertained and gratified; here is now exhibited a collection of examples, wherein the glorious grace of our great redeemer has appeared to, and on, the INDIANS of New-England. It mu&s;t not be imagined, the&s;e are all that could have been collected; for all the&s;e are only &s;elected from one i&s;land.</Q>
&mdash;It is &s;aid farther, the author of this hi&s;tory, Mr. Experience Mayhew, is a per&s;on of <HI>inconte&s;table veracity:</HI>&mdash;We again &s;ay, <HI>his truth may be relied on, his fidelity is irreproachable.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HERE, my lord, before we proceed farther, let us enquire, whether the mi&s;&s;ionaries in the&s;e parts, mu&s;t not be guilty of the mo&s;t inexcu&s;able neglect, in not infor|ming them&s;elves about the propagation of the go&s;pel among&s;t the indians, or render them&s;elves obnoxious to the <HI>heavier charge</HI> of wilful and pertinacious mi&s;repre|&s;entation? Nay, my lord, was it not their duty, their bounden duty, as faithful mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and embarked in the &s;ame common cau&s;e, with others, his profe&s;&s;ed di&s;ciples, of enlarging the borders of his king|dom, and e&s;pecially of directing &s;ome of the benign rays of the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s, to illuminate tho&s;e who &s;at in <HI>the region and &s;hadow of death</HI>;&mdash;was it not their
<PB N="20" REF="010948_0022_0F853101481ECBE0">
indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, I &s;ay, to have informed the &s;ociety of tho&s;e glorious endeavours, and in&s;tead of wilfully con|cealing, or artfully di&s;gui&s;ing them, to have employed the &s;uperior advantage of their corre&s;pondence with the &s;ociety, in &s;oliciting their aid, or rather importunately imploring their chri&s;tian munificence? And may I not a&s;&s;ert, without &s;peaking unadvi&s;edly, that your lord&s;hip appears, from what has been already offered, to be &s;o <HI>notoriou&s;ly</HI> mi&s;taken, with re&s;pect to the not civilizing and converting barbarous infidels, that the &s;ingle family of the <HI>Mayhews,</HI> hath done more towards accompli&s;hing that de&s;irable end, than all the &s;ociety's mi&s;&s;ionaries on the continent of North America?</P>
<P>AND what hath not been attempted in times of more modern date, for the advancement of the &s;ame glorious de&s;ign? "There are at this day," &s;ays that reverend and learned divine <HI>Dr. Chauncey,</HI> already mentioned, <Q>within the province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay</HI> only, &s;ixteen mini&s;ters, engli&s;h and indian, &s;tatedly labouring, as pa&s;tors of &s;o many <HI>Indian</HI> churches, or as preachers to a&s;&s;emblies of <HI>Indians,</HI> that meet together for divine wor&s;hip; nine engli&s;h lecturers, and &s;even &s;tated &s;chool-ma&s;ters, be&s;ides occa&s;ional ones; all which are under the care of commi&s;&s;ioners here, from the honourable company for the propagation of the go&s;|pel in New-England, and parts adjacent in America. The above account was handed to me from the records of the above commi&s;&s;ioners. There are at the &s;ettlement called Ma&s;hpe, two hundred Indians, under the care of the Rev. <HI>Mr. Hawley,</HI> who know no God be&s;ides the ever-living Jehovah, and &s;tatedly pay wor&s;hip to him, through the one mediator Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q>
Doth this, my lord, look like a <HI>notorious failing,</HI> in their endeavours to <HI>propagate the chri&s;tian

<P>IT is now above thirty years &s;ince an indian mi&s;&s;ion hath been e&s;tabli&s;hed at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> on the borders of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay,</HI> and executed by <HI>di&s;&s;enting mini|&s;ters.</HI> Accounts of this undertaking are in print; and the &s;ociety's mi&s;&s;ionaries could be at no lo&s;s to procure them. <HI>Mr. David Brainard,</HI> a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, and mi&s;&s;ionary from the <HI>&s;ociety in Scotland, for propagating chri&s;tian knowledge,</HI> &s;pent his life in go&s;pelizing &s;everal tribes of the natives, both in the province of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey. Being of too delicate a con&s;titution, to undergo the hard&s;hips to which he was expo&s;ed, and too ardently engaged in the work to quit it, he fell a &s;acrifice to the cau&s;e; and his name ought to be tran&s;|mitted to po&s;terity with immortal honour. A journal of his labours and &s;ucce&s;s among the indians, was publi&s;hed by him&s;elf in his life-time, and &s;ince his decea&s;e reprinted in London; &s;o that it appears incre|dible, that any mi&s;&s;ionary in New-Jer&s;ey &s;hould be ignorant of the matter. He was &s;ucceeded by his bro|ther, <HI>Mr. John Brainard,</HI> a mi&s;&s;ionary from the &s;ame &s;ociety, equally laborious and indefatigable, who is &s;till pur&s;uing the &s;ame laudable de&s;ign. At <HI>Lebanon,</HI> in the colony of Connecticut, <HI>Dr. Wheelock,</HI> another di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, has for &s;ome years pa&s;t carried on a &s;chool, for the in&s;truction of indian children in reading, writing, and the principles of chri&s;tianity, with an expre&s;s view of &s;ending the go&s;pel among the indians.
<PB N="22" REF="010948_0024_0F8531020DB7CB88">
Of this he has publi&s;hed a narrative; which it is ama|zing &s;hould never have fallen into the hands of any of the mi&s;&s;ionaries.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See it publi&s;hed at Bo&s;ton, 1763, and the continuation in 1765.</NOTE> <HI>Mr. Kirtland,</HI> a young gentleman educated at this &s;chool, has for three years pa&s;t, with indefatigable indu&s;try, and &s;ometimes at the peril of his life, been propagating the chri&s;tian faith among&s;t &s;ome tribes of the &s;ix nations. There is now, my lord, in England, an indian mini&s;ter, educated at this &s;chool, who has for two years pa&s;t had his maje&s;ty's brief to make collections for its &s;upport, and hath during that time been preaching throughout the kingdom. I am a&s;toni&s;hed, that a thing &s;o extraordinary in its nature, and &s;o frequently mentioned in the engli&s;h prints, &s;hould not have reached the ears of a per&s;on &s;o &s;ollicitous as your lord&s;hip appears to be, about the propagation of the go&s;pel among&s;t our <HI>barbarous infidels.</HI> Can it be a &s;ecret in England, my lord, that his mo&s;t gracious maje&s;ty, hath, by his royal bounty and liberality, at once encouraged and dignified that undertaking; and thereby &s;et a &s;hining example to all chri&s;tian monarchs, not to forget, amid&s;t the arduous affairs of &s;tate, the kingdom of THE PRINCE OF PEACE? Nay, had your lord&s;hip only vouch&s;afed to &s;pare a moment from &s;ecu|lar bu&s;ine&s;s, during the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, that amiable and pious nobleman, my lord <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> could minutely have informed your lord&s;hip, of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of that excellent &s;eminary; and that him&s;elf was pre&s;ident of a board of tru&s;tees, for the di&s;tribution of the money collected for it in England.</P>
<P>YOUR lord&s;hip is equally mi&s;taken in another fact. In the 19th page of the &s;ermon I find the&s;e words. <Q>The want of &s;eminaries in tho&s;e parts, for the educa|tion

Strange it is, my lord, and to me utterly unaccountable, that &s;o accurate an enquirer &s;hould &s;o egregiou&s;ly err, in a matter of &s;uch general notoriety, as public &s;eminaries of learning. We have no le&s;s than &s;ix colleges on the continent of North America; which are perhaps more by one half, than are really nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e of a liberal education, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of this country. There is a very antient one in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay</HI>&punc; The contiguous colonies of <HI>Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> have each of them one; and the dominion of <HI>Virginia</HI> another. <HI>That</HI> in <HI>New-York,</HI> being able to boa&s;t a mo&s;t honourable origin; being di&s;tingui&s;hed by a pre&s;ident, a clergyman of the church of England, <HI>as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> and founded with a particular eye to the advancement of epi&s;copacy in America, will probably e'er long appear as con&s;pi|cuous above the re&s;t, as father <HI>Aeneas</HI> among&s;t his fellow-adventurers. Such a number of &s;eminaries of learning is amply &s;ufficient, one would imagine, for the education of mini&s;ters, to propagate the go&s;pel throughout the whole extent of the habitable globe. In&s;tead of being deficient in this re&s;pect, the mo&s;t judicious among us, think our public &s;eminaries <HI>&s;uperfluou&s;ly</HI> multiplied. We want hands, my lord, more than heads. The mo&s;t intimate acquaintance with the cla&s;&s;ics, will not remove our oaks; nor a ta&s;te for the <HI>Georgics</HI> cultivate our lands. Many of our young people are knocking their heads again&s;t the <HI>Iliad,</HI> who &s;hould employ their hands in clearing our &s;wamps, and draining our mar&s;hes. Others are mu&s;ing, in cogitation profound, on the ar|rangement
<PB N="24" REF="010948_0026_0F853105D5A1F6C0">
of a &s;yllogi&s;m, while they ought to be gui|ding the tail of a plough. It therefore gives me concern, my lord, that your apprehen&s;ions of <HI>the want of &s;emi|naries undoing all that the &s;ociety have for many years been labouring to do,</HI> &s;hould unhappily di&s;compo&s;e the &s;erenity of your lord&s;hip's mind, even for a &s;ingle mo|ment. The apprehen&s;ion is certainly groundle&s;s. But I will not venture to promi&s;e, my lord, that our <HI>&s;uper|numerary</HI>
colleges will not, by diffu&s;ing a &s;pirit of in|quiry, create a general conviction, that it may, with greater truth be affirmed of the <HI>labours of the &s;ociety,</HI> what <HI>Grotius</HI> &s;o mode&s;tly &s;aid of his own, that they had been lo&s;t, <HI>nil opero&s;e agendo</HI>; or that your lord&s;hip hath, by preaching and printing the &s;ermon in que&s;tion, &mdash;<HI>done tho&s;e things which you ought not to have done.</HI></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t indeed, be admitted, that &s;ome of our colleges, for want of profe&s;&s;ors, and the comparative &s;mallne&s;s of their libraries; and others, through a very &s;lender philo&s;ophical apparatus, cannot pretend to vie with the univer&s;ities at home. Con&s;idering, however, the infancy of the country, they are far from being con|temptible; nor has it ever been remarked, that the clergy of the church of England, who have received their education at any of tho&s;e &s;eminaries, &s;everal of whom have been honoured with the degree of doctors of divinity, in England,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on, Dr. Cutler, Dr. Auchmuty, and Dr. Chandler, are in&s;tances, which I now recollect.</NOTE> are inferior in literary accom|pli&s;hments, to tho&s;e who have been educated in the Engli&s;h univer&s;ities. Be this as it may, it is notorious, that the American colleges are friendly to liberty, and our excellent con&s;titution; and &s;o firmly attached to revolution-principles, and the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hano|ver, that not one of them, as far as I have been able

to learn, hath ever produced (with all humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the famous univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI>) a &s;ingle <HI>Jacobite or Tory.</HI></P>
<P>WITH this, my lord, I &s;hall humbly take my leave, hoping that for the &s;ake of truth, and the cau&s;e of reli|gion, e&s;pecially remembring how greatly your lord&s;hip has been deceived in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, you will be &s;o gracious for the future, in whatever concerns the Ame|rican colonies, as to require the highe&s;t evidence of which the nature of the thing is capable. And heartily wi&s;hing, my lord, (it being ea&s;y to &s;ee for what purpo&s;e the&s;e kind of mi&s;informations are calculated) that your lord&s;hip may be &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;o thoroughly &s;atisfied in the di&s;charge of your epi&s;copal function, within the limits of your pre&s;ent dioce&s;e, as never to think it your duty, to exchange the See of <HI>Landaff,</HI> for an <HI>American Bi&s;hoprick.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, my Lord, Your Lord&s;hip's mo&s;t obedient humble &s;ervant, THE AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
