<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Sermon was drawn up on a few days notice, and without any view to the pre&s;s, at the reque&s;t of &s;ome of the Author's worthy Friends, to whom he could refu&s;e nothing of this kind. At their reque&s;t, it is now likewi&s;e &s;ubmitted to the Public, as it was preached, without varying or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a &s;ingle &s;en|timent or material expre&s;&s;ion; and with the addition only of a few lines, and three or four explanatory notes.</P>
<P>The Author con&s;idered that, although he was called to this office by a particular body, yet he was to addre&s;s a great and mixt a&s;&s;embly of his fellow-citizens, and a number of the fir&s;t characters in America, now met in con&s;ultation, at a mo&s;t alarming cri&s;is.</P>
<P>Animated with the pure&s;t zeal for the mutual intere&s;ts of Great-Britain and the Colonies; ardently panting for the return of tho&s;e Halcyon-days of harmony, during which both countries &s;o long flouri&s;hed together, as the glory and wonder of the world; he thought it his duty, with the utmo&s;t impartiality, to attempt a &s;tate of the unhappy controver&s;y that now rends the empire in pieces; and to &s;hew, if peradventure he might be permitted to vouch for his fellow citizens, &s;o far as he has been con|ver&s;ant among them, that the idea of an independence upon the Parent-country, or the lea&s;t licentious oppo&s;iti|on to its ju&s;t intere&s;ts, is utterly foreign to their thoughts; that they contend only for the &s;anctity of charters and laws, together with the right of granting their own money; and that our rightful Sovereign has no where more loyal &s;ubjects, or more zealou&s;ly attached to tho&s;e principles of government, under which his family inhe|rits the Throne.</P>
<P>The&s;e, with a few things which &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary re|&s;pecting the church at this time, are the topics handled in the following Sermon. If the principles it contains
<PB N="iv" REF="014460_0004_0F92B0F010A1C060">
are but thoroughly <HI>felt,</HI> the Reader will not regret that the limits of a &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e would not allow a particu|lar application of them. They will lead to their own application; or, at lea&s;t, that field is left open to &s;uc|ceeding Preachers.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if the kind expectations of the Au|thor's Friends can be in any degree an&s;wered; if what he has delivered &s;hall tend "to promote the <HI>Cau&s;e of Liberty and Virtue;</HI>" and particularly, if it could find its way to the clo&s;ets, or rather to the hearts, of the <HI>Great,</HI> and (after all the arguments they have heard from others) could in the lea&s;t induce them to ju&s;ter and more benevolent &s;entiments concerning their American bre|thren&mdash;he would account it among the happie&s;t circum|&s;tances of his life.</P>
<P>Enough has &s;urely been attempted, by way of experi|ment, to be convinced that the people of this country know their rights, and will not con&s;ent to a <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> &s;ur|render of them&mdash;It is, now at lea&s;t, time to pur&s;ue ano|ther mode, and to li&s;ten to &s;ome plan for averting the dreadful calamities which mu&s;t attend a ho&s;tile pro&s;ecu|tion of this unnatural conte&s;t. The author's wi&s;hes for the accompli&s;hment of &s;uch a plan, have been &s;o frequently expre&s;&s;ed as to &s;ubject him perhaps to &s;u&s;picions which he would not wi&s;h to merit, either here or el&s;e where. But &s;till, if he could &s;ee it take place, upon a ju&s;t and perma|nent foundation, he would be content, if it were required, to &s;ing his "<HI>nunc dimittis,</HI>" and to take a final leave of earthly concerns.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>JOSHUA xxii.22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Lord God of Gods&mdash;the Lord God of Gods&mdash;He knoweth, and I&s;rael he &s;hall know&mdash;if it be in Rebellion, or in Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion a|gain&s;t the Lord&mdash;<HI>Save us not this Day.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words, my Brethren, will lead us into a train of reflections, wholly &s;uitable to the de&s;ign of our pre&s;ent meeting; and I mu&s;t beg your indulgence till I explain, as briefly as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;olemn occa&s;ion on which they were fir&s;t delivered; hoping the application, I may afterwards make of them, may fully reward your attention.</P>
<P>THE two tribes of Reuben and of Gad, and the half tribe of Mana&s;&s;eh, had cho&s;en their inheritance, on the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of Jordan, oppo&s;ite to the other tribes of I&s;rael. And although they knew that this &s;ituation would deprive them of &s;ome privi|leges which remained with their brethren on the other &s;ide, and particularly that great privilege of having the place of the Al|tar and Tabernacle of God among them; yet, as the land of Canaan was judged too &s;mall for all the twelve tribes, they were contented with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion they had cho&s;en. And thus they &s;poke to Mo&s;es&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>IT is a land of cattle, and thy &s;ervants have much cattle. Wherefore, if we have found grace in thy &s;ight, let this land be given to us for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and we will build &s;heepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our <HI>little ones</HI>; and we our|&s;elves will go ready armed before our brethren, the children of I&s;rael,&mdash;and will not return into our hou&s;es, until they have inherited every man his inheritance.&mdash;</P>
<P>AND Mo&s;es &s;aid unto them&mdash;If you will do this thing, and will go all of you <HI>armed</HI> over Jordan before the Lord, until he have driven out his enemies from before him; and the land (of Canaan) be &s;ubdued (for your brethren;) then after|wards ye &s;hall return, and this land (of Gilead) &s;hall be your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion before the Lord</P>
<BIBL>&mdash;Numb. 32.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THIS, then, was the great <HI>original contract,</HI> under which the&s;e two tribes and a half were allowed to &s;eparate from the re&s;t, and
<PB N="6" REF="014460_0006_0F92B0F1AB4243B8">
to dwell on the other &s;ide of Jordan. They were to a&s;&s;i&s;t their brethren in their nece&s;&s;ary wars, and to continue under <HI>one Go|vernment</HI>
with them&mdash;even that of the great Jehovah him&s;elf&mdash; erecting no &s;eparate altar, but coming to perform their &s;acri|fices at that <HI>one Altar</HI> of SHILOH, where the Lord had vouch|&s;afed to promi&s;e his &s;pecial pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>THOUGH this &s;ubjected them to inconveniencies, yet as Uni|formity of Wor&s;hip and the Nature of their <HI>Theocracy</HI> required it, they adhered faithfully to their contract.</P>
<P>IN the fear of God, they bowed them&s;elves at his altar, al|though not placed in their own land; and, in love to their bre|thren, they &s;upported them in their wars, "till there &s;tood not a man of all their enemies before them;" and at la&s;t, JOSHUA, their great leader, having no farther need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, gave them this noble te&s;timony&mdash;That they had in all things obey'd his voice as their general, and faithfully performed all that they had promi&s;ed to Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of God. Where|fore, he ble&s;&s;ed them, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them to return to their own land <Q>with much riches, and with cattle, and with &s;ilver, and with gold, and with much raiment.</Q></P>
<P>No &s;ooner, therefore, had they entered their own country, than in the fullne&s;s of gratitude, on the banks of Jordan, at the common pa&s;&s;age, over again&s;t Canaan, they built an <HI>high</HI> or <HI>great Altar,</HI> that it might remain an eternal monument of their being of one &s;tock, and entitled to the &s;ame civil and religious privileges, with their brethren of the other tribes.</P>
<P>BUT this their work of piety and love was directly mi&s;con&s;tru|ed. The cry was immediately rai&s;ed again&s;t them. The zea|lots of that day &s;crupled not to declare them <HI>Rebels</HI> again&s;t the living God, violators of his &s;acred laws and <HI>Theocracy,</HI> in &s;etting up an altar again&s;t his holy altar; and therefore the whole con|gregations of the brother-tribes, that dwelt in Canaan, gathered them&s;elves together, to go up to war again&s;t their own fle&s;h and blood; in a blind tran&s;port of unrighteous zeal, purpo&s;ing to ex|tirpate them from the face of the earth, as enemies to God and the common wealth of I&s;rael!</P>
<P>IN that awful and important moment (and oh my God that the example could be copied among the brother-tribes of our I&s;|rael, in the parent land) I &s;ay, in that awful and important moment, &s;ome milder and more benevolent men there were, who&s;e zeal did not &s;o far tran&s;port them, but that, before they un&s;heath'd the &s;word to plunge it with unhallowed hand into the bowels of their brethren, they thought it ju&s;tice fir&s;t to enquire into the truth of the charge again&s;t them. And, for the glory of I&s;rael, this peaceable and prudent council prevailed.</P>
<P>A MOST &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y was prepared, at the head of which
<PB N="7" REF="014460_0007_0F92B0F1E5DDFC28">
was a man of &s;acred character, and venerable authority, breath|ing the dictates of religion and humanity; PHINEHAS the &s;on of Eleazer the high Prie&s;t, accompanied with ten other Chiefs or Princes, one from each of the nine tribes as well as from the re|maining half tribe of Mana&s;&s;eh.</P>
<P>GREAT was the a&s;toni&s;hment of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The two tribes and a half are here briefly and generally denominat|ed Gileadites, from the name of the land they had cho&s;en.</NOTE> Gileadites on receiving this emba&s;&s;y, and hearing the charge again&s;t them. But the pow|er of con&s;cious innocence is above all fear, and the language of an upright heart &s;uperior to all eloquence. By a &s;olemn appeal to Heaven for the rectitude of their intentions, unpremeditated and vehement in the words of my text, they di&s;armed their brethren of every &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>"THE Lord God of Gods," &s;ay they (in the fervency of truth, repeating the invocation) "the Lord God of Gods,"&mdash;He that made the heavens and the earth, who &s;earcheth the hearts, and is acquainted with the mo&s;t &s;acred thoughts, of all men&mdash;"He knoweth, and all I&s;rael &s;hall know," by our un&s;haken con&s;tan|cy in the religion of our fathers,&mdash;that this charge again&s;t us is utterly fal&s;e.</P>
<P>THEN turning from their brethren, with un&s;peakable dignity of &s;oul and clearne&s;s of con&s;cience, they addre&s;s the almighty Je|hovah him&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>OH thou &s;overeign Ruler of the univer&s;e&mdash;our God and our Fathers God&mdash;"if it be in Rebellion or in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again&s;t thee," that we have rai&s;ed this monument of our zeal for the com|monwealth of I&s;rael&mdash;"SAVE US NOT THIS DAY!" If the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought has entered our hearts of erecting an <HI>independent altar</HI>; if we have &s;ought, in one in&s;tance, to derogate from the glory of that &s;acred Altar which thou ha&s;t placed among our bre|thren beyond Jordan, as the common bond of union and wor&s;hip among all the tribes of I&s;rael&mdash;let not this day's &s;un de&s;cend up|on us, till thou ha&s;t made us a monument of thine avenging ju|&s;tice, in the &s;ight of the &s;urrounding world!</P>
<P>AFTER this a&s;toni&s;hing appeal to the great God of Heaven and Earth, they proceed to rea&s;on with their brethren; and tell them that, &s;o far from intending a &s;eparation either in government or religion, this altar was built with a direct contrary purpo&s;e&mdash; <Q>That it might be a witne&s;s between us and you, and our gene|rations after us; that your children may not &s;ay to our children in time to come, ye have no part in the Lord.</Q>
We were afraid le&s;t in &s;ome future age, when our po&s;terity may cro&s;s Jordan to offer &s;acrifices in the place appointed, your po&s;terity may thru&s;t them from the altar, and tell them that becau&s;e they live not in
<PB N="8" REF="014460_0008_0F92B0F3529AD140">
the land where the Lord's tabernacle dwelleth, they are none of his people, nor intitled to the Jewi&s;h privileges.</P>
<P>BUT while this altar &s;tands, they &s;hall always have an an&s;wer ready. They will be able to &s;ay&mdash; <Q>Behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made.</Q>
If our fathers had not been of the &s;eed of I&s;rael, they would not have fondly copied your cu&s;toms and models. You would not have beheld in <HI>Gile|ad,</HI> an altar, in all things an imitation of the true altar of God, which is in Shiloh; except only that ours is an high "or great altar to &s;ee" from far. And this may convince you that it was not intended as an altar of &s;acrifice (for then it would have been but three cubits in height, as our law directs) but as a monument|al altar, to in&s;truct our generations for ever, that they are of the &s;ame pedigree with your&s;elves, and intitled to the &s;ame civil and religious privileges.</P>
<P>THIS noble defence wrought an immediate reconciliation a|mong the di&s;cordant tribes. <Q>The Words, (when reported) plea&s;ed the children of I&s;rael&mdash;they ble&s;&s;ed God together</Q>
for preventing the effu&s;ion of kindred blood, <Q>and did not go up to de&s;troy the land where their brethren, the children of Reu|ben <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Though for brevity, the &s;acred text, in this and other places, only mentions Reuben and Gad, yet the half tribe of Mana&s;&s;eh is al&s;o &s;up|po&s;ed to be included.</NOTE> and Gad, dwelt.</Q></P>
<P>THE whole hi&s;tory of the Bible cannot furni&s;h a pa&s;&s;age more in&s;tructive than this, to the members of a great empire, who&s;e dreadful misfortune it is to have the evil Demon of civil or reli|gious <HI>di&s;cord</HI> gone forth among them. And would to God, that the application I am now to make of it could be delivered in ac|cents louder than Thunder, till they have pierced the ear of every Briton, and e&s;pecially their ears who have meditated war and de|&s;truction again&s;t their brother-tribes of Reuben and Gad, in this our <HI>American Gilead.</HI> And let me add&mdash;would to God too that we, who this day con&s;ider our&s;elves in the place of tho&s;e tribes, may, like them, be &s;till able to lay our hands on our hearts in a &s;olemn appeal to the God of Gods, for the rectitude of our in|tentions towards the <HI>whole</HI> common wealth of our BRITISH IS|RAEL. For, call'd to this &s;acred place, on this great occa&s;ion, I know it is your wi&s;h that I &s;hould &s;tand &s;uperior to all <HI>partial motives,</HI> and be found alike unbia&s;s'd by favour or by fear. And happy it is that the parallel, now to be drawn, requires not the lea&s;t &s;acrifice either of truth or virtue!</P>
<P>LIKE the tribes of Reuben and Gad, we have cho&s;en our inhe|ritance, in a land &s;eperated from that of our fathers and brethren, not indeed by a &s;mall River, but an immen&s;e Ocean. This in|heritance
<PB N="9" REF="014460_0009_0F92B0F4478BBB70">
we likewi&s;e hold by a plain <HI>original contract,</HI> entitling us to all the natural and improvable advantages of our &s;ituation, and to a community of privileges with our brethren, in every civil and religious re&s;pect; except in this, that the throne or &s;eat of Empire, that great altar at which the men of this world bow, was to remain among them.</P>
<P>REGARDLESS of this local inconvenience, uncanker'd by jea|lou&s;y, un-depre&s;s'd by fear, and cemented by mutual love and mutual benefits, we trod the path of glory with our brethren for an hundred years and more&mdash;enjoying a length of felicity &s;carce e|ver experienced by any other people. Mindful of the hands that protected us in our youth and &s;ubmitting to every ju&s;t regula|tion for appropriating to them the Benefit of our trade&mdash;our wealth was poured in upon them from ten thou&s;and channels, widening as they flowed, and making their poor to &s;ing, and in|du&s;try to &s;mile, through every corner of their land. And as of|ten as dangers threaten'd, and the voice of the Briti&s;h I&s;rael called our brethren to the field, we left them not alone, but &s;hared their toils, and &s;ought by their &s;ide, <Q>till there &s;tood not a man of all their enemies before them.</Q>
Nay, they them&s;elves te&s;tifi|ed on our behalf, that in all things we not only did our part, but more than our part for the common Good, and they di&s;|mi&s;s'd us home loaded with &s;ilver and with gold, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The parliamentary reinbur&s;ements for our exertions in the late war; &s;imilar to what Jo&s;hua gave the two tribes and a half on the clo&s;e of his wars.</NOTE> in recom|pence for our extraordinary &s;ervices.</P>
<P>So far you &s;ee the parallel holds good. But what <HI>high altars</HI>
have we built to alarm our Briti&s;h I&s;rael; and why have the congregations of our brethren gathered them&s;elves together a|gain&s;t us? why do their embattled ho&s;ts already cover our plains? will they not examine our ca&s;e, and li&s;ten to our plea?</P>
<P>"THE Lord God of Gods&mdash;he knows" and the whole &s;ur|rounding world &s;hall yet know, that whatever <HI>American altars</HI> we have built, far from intending to di&s;honour, have been rai&s;ed with an expre&s;s view to perpetuate the name and glory of that &s;a|cred altar, and &s;eat of empire and liberty, which we left behind us, and wi&s;h to remain eternal, among our brethren, in the pa|rent land!</P>
<P>ESTEEMING our relation to them our greate&s;t felicity; ador|ing the providence that gave us the &s;ame progenitors; glory|ing in this, that when the <HI>new-world</HI> was to be portioned out among the kingdoms of the <HI>old,</HI> the mo&s;t important part of this continent fell to the &s;ons of a prote&s;tant and free nation; de&s;irous of wor&s;hiping for ever at the &s;ame altar with them;
<PB N="10" REF="014460_0010_0F92B0F64C885408">
fond of their manners, even to exce&s;s; enthu&s;ia&s;ts to that &s;a|cred plan of civil and religious happine&s;s, for the pre&s;ervation of which they have &s;acrificed from age to age; maintaining, and always ready to maintain, at the ri&s;que of every thing that is dear to us, the mo&s;t un&s;haken fidelity to our common Sove|reign, as the great center of our union, and guardian of our mutual rights;&mdash;I &s;ay, with the&s;e principles and the&s;e views, we thought it our duty, to build up American altars, or <HI>con|&s;titutions,</HI> as nearly as we could, upon the great Briti&s;h model.</P>
<P>HAVING never &s;old our birth-right, we con&s;idered our&s;elves entitled to the privileges of our father's hou&s;e&mdash;"to enjoy peace, liberty and &s;afety;" to be governed, like our brethren, by our own laws, in all matters properly affecting our&s;elves, and to offer up own our &s;acrifices at the altar of Briti&s;h empire; con|tending that a forced devotion is idolatry, and that no power on earth has a right to come in between us and a gracious &s;ove|reign, to mea&s;ure forth our loyalty, or to grant our property, <HI>without our con&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are the principles we inherited from Britons them&s;elves. Could we depart from them, we &s;hould be deemed ba&s;tards and not &s;ons, aliens and not brethren.</P>
<P>THE altars therefore which we have built, are not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this re&s;pect, our plea is even &s;tronger than that of the two tribes and a half. For, till an explanation was given, the <HI>height</HI> of their altar, like tho&s;e of the heathen, who loved to &s;acrifice on lofty places, might create a &s;u&s;picion of their <Q>lap&s;ing into idolatry; either intending to wor&s;hip other Gods, or the God of I&s;rael in an unlaw|ful place and manner.</Q>
<BIBL><HI>Bp. PATRICK.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> high or rival altars to create jealou&s;y, but humble monuments of our union and love; intended to bring millions yet unborn, from e|very corner of this va&s;t continent, to bend at the great parent-altar of Briti&s;h liberty; venerating the country from which they &s;prung, and pouring their gifts into her lap when their countle&s;s thou&s;ands &s;hall far exceed hers.</P>
<P>IT was our wi&s;h that there &s;hould be an eternal "Witne&s;s be|tween our brethren and us; that if at any future period, amid the &s;hifting &s;cenes of human intere&s;ts and human affections, their children &s;hould &s;ay to our children&mdash;"Ye have no portion" in the birth-right of Britons, and &s;o &s;eek to pu&s;h them from the common &s;hrine of Freedom, when they come to pay their ho|mage there; they might always have an an&s;wer ready&mdash;"Be|hold the pattern of the altar which our Fathers built." Behold your own religious and civil in&s;titutions, and then examine the frames of government and &s;y&s;tems of laws rai&s;ed by our fathers in every part of America! Could the&s;e have been &s;uch exact
<PB N="11" REF="014460_0011_0F92B0F6853F71E0">
copies of your own, if they had not inherited the &s;ame &s;pirit, and &s;prung from the &s;ame &s;tock, with your&s;elvs.</P>
<P>THUS far you &s;ee the parallel yet holds good, and I think cannot be called a perver&s;ion of my text; if you will allow that the &s;upreme power of an empire, whether theocratical, monar|chical, or how&s;oever di&s;tributed, may be repre&s;ented under the figure of <HI>one</HI> common <HI>altar,</HI> at which the ju&s;t devotion of all the &s;ubjects is to be paid.</P>
<P>BUT it is &s;aid that we have of late departed from our for|mer line of duty, and <HI>refu&s;ed</HI> our homage at the great <HI>altar</HI> of Briti&s;h empire. And to this it has been replied, that the very <HI>refu&s;al</HI> is the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of our veneration for the <HI>altar</HI> it|&s;elf. Nay, it is contended by tho&s;e charged with this breach of devotion, that when in the &s;hape of uncon&s;titutional exacti|ons, violated rights and mutilated charters, they were called to wor&s;hip <HI>idols,</HI> in&s;tead of the true <HI>divinity,</HI> it was in a tran&s;port of holy jealou&s;y, that they da&s;hed them to pieces, or whelm'd them to the bottom of the ocean.</P>
<P>THIS is, in brief, the &s;tate of the argument on each &s;ide. And hence, at this dreadful moment, ancient friends and bre|thren &s;tand prepared for events of the mo&s;t tragic nature.</P>
<P>HERE the weight of my &s;ubject almo&s;t overcomes me; but think not that I am going to damp that noble ardor which at this in&s;tant glows in every bo&s;om pre&s;ent. Neverthele&s;s, as from an early acquaintance with many of you, I know that your principles are pure, and your humanity only equal'd by your tran&s;cendent love of your country, I am &s;ure you will indulge the pa&s;&s;ing tear, which a preacher of the Go&s;pel of Love mu&s;t now &s;hed over the &s;cenes that lie before us&mdash;Great and deep di&s;tre&s;s about to pervade every corner of our land! millions to be called from their peaceful labors by "the &s;ound of the trum|pet, and the alarm of war! Garments roll'd in blood," and even Victory it&s;elf only yielding an occa&s;ion to weep over friends and relatives &s;lain! The&s;e are melancholy pro&s;pects; and therefore you will feel with me the difficulties I now labour under&mdash;for&s;aken by my text, and left to lament alone that, in the Parent-land, no PHINEHAS has prevailed; no Emba&s;&s;y <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is acknowledged with gratitude that many great and exalted characters have pled the cau&s;e of America; and, previous to all coer|cive mea&s;ures, advi&s;ed an enquiry or hearing, &s;imilar to that for which <HI>Phinehas</HI> was appointed. What is here lamented, and will be long lamented, is that this council could not take place. If brethren could come together in &s;uch a temper as this, the i&s;&s;ue could not fail to be for their mutual glory and mutual happine&s;s.</NOTE> of great or good men has been rai&s;ed, to &s;tay the &s;word of de&s;truc|tion,
<PB N="12" REF="014460_0012_0F92B0F722CEC440">
to examine into the truth of our ca&s;e, and &s;ave the effu|&s;ion of kindred blood. I am left to lament that, in this &s;ad in|&s;tance, <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> tenderne&s;s has put <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> benevolence to &s;hame.</P>
<P><Q>OUR Brethren, the hou&s;e of our Fathers, even they have called a multitude again&s;t us. Had an enemy thus reproach'd us, then perhaps we might have borne it. But is was you, Men our equals, our guides, our acquaintance, with whom we took &s;weet council and walked together into the hou&s;e of God.</Q>
Or had it been for any e&s;&s;ential benefit to the common|wealth at large, we would have laid our hands on our mouths and bowed obedience with our u&s;ual &s;ilence. But for DIGNITY and SUPREMACY! What are they when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to common utility, common ju&s;tice, and the whole faith and &s;pi|rit of the Con&s;titution? True Dignity is to govern Freemen, not Slaves: and true Supremacy is to excel in Doing Good.</P>
<P>IT is time, and indeed more than time, for a great and enlighten|ed people to make <HI>names</HI> bend to <HI>things,</HI> and <HI>ideal honor</HI> to <HI>practical &s;afety?</HI> Precedents and indefinite claims are &s;urely things too nu|gatory to convul&s;e a mighty empire. Is there no wi&s;dom, no great and liberal plan of policy to re-unite its members, as the &s;ole bulwark of liberty and prote&s;tanti&s;m; rather than by their deadly &s;trife to encrea&s;e the importance of tho&s;e &s;tates that are foes to freedom, truth and humanity? To devi&s;e &s;uch a plan; and to behold Briti&s;h Colonies &s;preading over this immen&s;e Con|tinent, rejoicing in the common rights of freemen, and imitat|ing the Parent State in every excellence&mdash;is more glory than to hold lawle&s;s dominion over all the nations on the face of the earth!</P>
<P>BUT I will weary you no longer with fruitle&s;s lamentations concerning things that <HI>might be</HI> done. The que&s;tion now is&mdash; &s;ince they are not done, mu&s;t we tamely &s;urrender any part of our birthright or of that great charter of privileges, which we not only claim by inheritance, but by the expre&s;s terms of our co|lonization? I &s;ay, <HI>God forbid!</HI> For here, in particular, I wi&s;h to &s;peak &s;o plain that neither my own principles, nor tho&s;e of the church to which I belong, may be mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH, in the beginning of this great conte&s;t, we thought it not our duty to be forward in widening the breach, or &s;pread|ing di&s;content; although it be our fervent de&s;ire to heal the wounds of the public, and to &s;hew by our temper that we &s;eek not to di&s;tre&s;s, but to give the parent &s;tate an opportunity of &s;av|ing them&s;elves and &s;aving us before it be too late; neverthele&s;s, as we know that our civil and religious rights are linked together in one indi&s;&s;oluble bond, we neither have, nor &s;eek to have, any intere&s;t &s;eparate from that of our country; nor can we advi&s;e a de&s;ertion of its cau&s;e. Religion and liberty mu&s;t flouri&s;h or fall together in America. We pray that both may be perpetual.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014460_0013_0F92B0F92D6FC660">A CONTINUED &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to violence is no tenet of our church. When her brighte&s;t luminaries, near a century pa&s;t, were called to propagate the court doctrine of a <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing Power, above Law</HI>&mdash; did they treacherou&s;ly cry&mdash;"<HI>Peace, Peace,</HI>" when there was no <HI>Peace!</HI> Did they not magnanimou&s;ly &s;et their foot upon the line of the con&s;titution, and tell Maje&s;ty to its face that "they could not betray the public liberty," and that the Monarch's only &s;afe|ty con&s;i&s;ted "in governing according to the laws?" Did not their axample, and con&s;equent &s;ufferings, kindle a flame that il|luminated the land and introduced that noble &s;y&s;tem of public and per&s;onal liberty, &s;ecured by the revolution? Since that period, have not the avowed principles of our greate&s;t divines been a|gain&s;t rai&s;ing the <HI>Church</HI> above the <HI>State</HI>; jealou&s;e of the national rights, re&s;olute for the <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, favourable to the <HI>reformed</HI> religion, and de&s;irous to maintain the faith of <HI>Toleration?</HI>
If exceptions have happened, let no &s;ociety of chri&s;tians &s;tand an|&s;werable for the deviations, or corruptions, of individuals.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of ab&s;olute NON-RESISTANCE has been fully exploded among every v<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">uous people. The free-born &s;oul re|volts again&s;t it, and mu&s;t have been long deba&s;ed, and have drank in the la&s;t dregs of corruption, before it can brook the idea <Q>that a whole people injured may, in no ca&s;e, recogni&s;e their trampled Maje&s;ty.</Q>
But to draw the line, and &s;ay where &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion ends and re&s;i&s;tance begins, is not the province of the mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who has given no <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author, in a &s;ermon fir&s;t publi&s;hed <HI>20</HI> years ago, on <HI>1</HI> Peter <HI>ii, 17.</HI> delivered his &s;entiments fully on this point&mdash;in the following words, viz.&mdash;"It would be ab&s;urd to argue as &s;ome have done, that the apo&s;tle here meant to enjoin a <HI>continued &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> to violence&mdash;The love of mankind, and the fear of God, tho&s;e very principles from which we trace the divine original of ju&s;t government, will lead us, by all probable means, to re&s;i&s;t every attempt to en&s;lave the free-born &s;oul, and oppo&s;e the righteous will of God by defeating the happine&s;s of men. Re&s;i|&s;tance, however, is to be a la&s;t re&s;ource, and none but the majority of a whole people, can determine in what ca&s;es it is nece&s;&s;ary. In the Scrip|tures, therefore, obedience is rightly inculcated in general terms. For a people may &s;ometimes imagine grievances they do not feel, but will never mi&s;s to feel and complain of them where they really are, unle&s;s their minds have been gradually prepared for &s;lavery by ab&s;urd tenets."</NOTE> rule in this matter, but left it to the feelings and con&s;ciences of the injured. For when pre&s;&s;ures and &s;ufferings come, when the weight of power grows intolerable, a people will fly to the con&s;titution for &s;helter, and, if able, will re&s;ume that power which they never &s;urrendered, ex|cept &s;o far as it might be exerci&s;ed for the common &s;afety. Pul|pit-ca&s;ui&s;try is too feeble to direct or controul here. God, in

his own government of the world, never violates freedom; and his &s;criptures them&s;elves would be di&s;regarded, or con&s;idered as perverted, if brought to belie his voice, &s;peaking in the hearts of men.</P>
<P>THE application of the&s;e principles, my brethren, is now ea|&s;y and mu&s;t be left to your own con&s;ciences and feelings. You are now engaged in one of the grande&s;t &s;truggles, to which free|men can be called. You are contending for what you conceive to be your con&s;titutional rights, and for a final &s;ettlement of the terms upon which this country may be perpetually united to the Parent State.</P>
<P>LOOK back, therefore, with reverence look back, to the times of ancient virtue and renown. Look back to the mighty pur|po&s;es which your fathers had in view, when they traver&s;ed a va&s;t ocean, and planted this land. Recal to your minds their labors, their toils, their per&s;everance, and let their divine &s;pirit animate you in all your actions.</P>
<P>LOOK forward al&s;o to di&s;tant po&s;terity. Figure to your&s;elves millions and millions to &s;pring from your loins, who may be born <HI>freemen</HI> or <HI>&s;laves</HI> as Heaven &s;hall now approve or reject your councils. Think that on you it may depend, whether this great country, in ages hence, &s;hall be filled and adorned with a virtu|ous and enlightened people; enjoying LIBERTY and all its con|comitant ble&s;&s;ings, together with the RELIGION of JESUS, as it flows uncorrupted from his holy Oracles; or covered with a race of men more contemptible than the &s;avages that roam the wilderne&s;s, becau&s;e they once knew the <Q>things which belong|ed to their happine&s;s and peace, but &s;uffered them to be hid from their eyes.</Q></P>
<P>AND while you thus look <HI>back</HI> to the <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> and <HI>forward</HI> to the future, fail not, I be&s;eech you, to <HI>look up</HI> to "the God of Gods&mdash; the Rock of your Salvation. As the clay in the potter's hands," &s;o are the nations of the earth in the hands of Him. the ever|la&s;ting JEHOVAH! He lifteth up&mdash;and he ca&s;teth down <Q>&mdash;He re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble&mdash;He will keep the feet of his &s;aints&mdash;the wicked &s;hall be &s;ilent in dark|ne&s;s, and by &s;trength &s;hall no man prevail.</Q></P>
<P>THE bright pro&s;pects of the Go&s;pel; a thorough veneration of the Saviour of the world; a con&s;cientious obedience to his di|vine laws; faith in his promi&s;es; and the &s;tedfa&s;t hope of im|mortal life through him; the&s;e only can &s;upport a man in all times of adver&s;ity as well as pro&s;perity. You might more ea&s;ily "&s;trike fire out of ice," than &s;tability or magnanimity out of crimes. But the good man, he who is at peace with the God of all peace, will know no fear but that of offending him, who&s;e hand can cover the righteous <Q>&s;o that he needs not fear the ar|row
<PB N="15" REF="014460_0015_0F92B0FA10575D68">
that fleeth by day, nor the de&s;truction that wa&s;teth at noon-day; for a thou&s;and &s;hall fall be&s;ide him, and ten thou|&s;and at his right hand, but it &s;hall not come nigh to him; for he &s;hall give his angels charge over him to keep him in all his ways</Q></P>
<P>ON the omnipotent God, therefore, thro' his ble&s;&s;ed Son, let your &s;trong confidence be placed; but do not vainly expect that every day will be to you a day of pro&s;perity or triumph. The ways of providence lie through mazes, too intricate for human penetration. Mercies may often be held forth to us in the &s;hape of &s;ufferings; and the vici&s;&s;itudes of our fortune in building up this American fabric of happine&s;s and glory may be various and chequer'd.</P>
<P>BUT let not this di&s;courage you. Yea rather let it animate you with a holy <HI>fervor</HI>&mdash;a divine <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI>&mdash;ever per&s;uading your&s;elves that the cau&s;e of <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>Freedom</HI> is the CAUSE of GOD upon earth; and that the whole theatre of human nature does not exhibit a more augu&s;t &s;pectacle than a number of Free|men, in dependence upon Heaven, mutually binding them&s;elves to encounter every difficulty and danger in &s;upport of their na|tive and con&s;titutional rights, and for tran&s;mitting them wholly and unviolated to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>IT was this principle that in&s;pired the heroes of ancient times; that rai&s;ed their names to the &s;ummit of renown, and filled all &s;ucceeding ages with their un&s;potted prai&s;e. It is this princi|ple too that mu&s;t animate your conduct, if you wi&s;h your names to reach future generations, con&s;picuous in the roll of glory; and &s;o far as this principle leads you, be prepared to follow&mdash; whether to life or to death.</P>
<P>WHILE you profe&s;s your&s;elves contending for Liberty, let it be with the temper and dignity of freemen, undaunted and firm, but without wrath or vengeance, &s;o far as grace may be obtain|ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the weakne&s;s of nature. Con&s;ider it as a happy cir|cum&s;tance, if &s;uch a &s;truggle mu&s;t have happened, that God hath been plea&s;ed to po&s;tpone it to a period, when our country is adorned with men of enlightened zeal; when the arts and &s;ci|ences are planted among us to &s;ecure a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch men; when our morals are not far tainted by luxury, profu&s;ion or di&s;&s;ipation; when the principles that with&s;tood oppre&s;&s;ion, in the brighte&s;t aera of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, are ours as it were by peculiar inheritance; and when we &s;tand upon our own ground, with all that is dear around us, animating us to every patriotic exertion. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances and upon &s;uch principles, what wonders, what atchievements of true glory, have not been performed!</P>
<P>FOR my part, I have long been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;trong and
<PB N="16" REF="014460_0016_0F92B0FC5DFDCBA0">
even enthu&s;ia&s;tic per&s;ua&s;ion, that Heaven has great and gracious purpo&s;es towards this continent, which no human power or human device &s;hall be able finally to fru&s;trate. Illiberal or mi&s;taken plans of policy may di&s;tre&s;s us for a while, and perhaps &s;orely check our growth; but if we maintain our own virtue; if we cultivate the &s;pirit of Liberty among our children; if we guard again&s;t the &s;nares of luxury, venality and corruption; the GENIUS of AMERICA will &s;till ri&s;e tri|umphant, and that with a power at la&s;t too mighty for oppo&s;i|tion. This country <HI>will be free</HI>&mdash;nay, for ages to come, a cho&s;en &s;eat of <HI>Freedom, Arts,</HI> and <HI>heavenly knowledge</HI>; which are now either drooping or dead in mo&s;t countries of the old world.</P>
<P>To conclude, &s;ince the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of all public bodies, under God, con&s;i&s;ts in their UNION; bear with each other's infirmities, and even varieties of &s;entiments, in things not e&s;&s;ential to the main point. The tempers of men are ca&s;t in various molds. Some are quick and <HI>feelingly alive</HI> in all their mental operations, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e which relate to their country's weal, and are there|fore ready to bur&s;t forth into flame upon every alarm. Others a|gain, with intentions alike pure, and a clear unquenchable love of their country, too &s;tedfa&s;t to be damped by the mi&s;ts of preju|dice, or worked up into conflagration by the rude bla&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, think it their duty to weigh con&s;equences, and to deliberate fully upon the probable means of obtaining public ends. Both the&s;e kinds of men &s;hould bear with each other; for both are friends to their country.</P>
<P>ONE thing further let me add, that without <HI>order</HI> and ju&s;t <HI>&s;u|bordination,</HI> there can be no <HI>union</HI> in public bodies. However much you may be equals on other occa&s;ions, yet all this mu&s;t cea&s;e in an united and a&s;&s;ociated capacity; and every individual is bound to keep the place and duty a&s;&s;igned him, by ties far more powerful over a man of virtue and honour, than all the other ties which human policy can contrive. It had been better never to have lifted a voice in your country's cau&s;e, than to betray it by want of <HI>Union</HI>; or to leave worthy men, who have embarked their all for the common good, to &s;uffer, or &s;tand una&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>LASTLY, by every method in your power, and in every po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e, &s;upport the LAWS of your country. In a conte&s;t for liberty, think what a crime it would be, to &s;uffer one <HI>Freeman</HI> to be in|&s;ulted, or wantonly injured in his liberty, &s;o far as by your means it may be prevented.</P>
<P>THUS animated and thus acting&mdash;We may then SING with the prophet&mdash;</P>

In&s;pire us with a high and commanding &s;en&s;e of the value of our con&s;titutional rights! may a &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and virtue be poured down upon us all; and may our Repre&s;entatives, tho&s;e who are delegated to <HI>devi&s;e</HI> and appointed to <HI>execute</HI> public mea|&s;ures, be directed to &s;uch, as thou in thy &s;overeign goodne&s;s &s;hall be plea&s;ed to render effectual for the &s;alvation of a great empire, and re-uniting all its members in one &s;acred bond of harmony and public happine&s;s!
