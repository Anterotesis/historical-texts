<HEAD><BIBL>EXODUS I.8.</BIBL> NOW THERE AROSE UP A NEW KING OVER EGYPT, WHICH KNEW NOT JOSEPH.</HEAD>
<P>_IT will be thought &s;trange, no doubt, at lea&s;t at fir&s;t view, that the preacher &s;hould make choice of a Text like this, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion as the pre&s;ent. The audience will &s;ay,
<Q>What relation can the &s;tory of Jo&s;eph, and the hi&s;tory of the Egyptian kings, have to the important bu&s;ine&s;s on which we are a&s;&s;embled? What remarks can be made on Pharaoh's ignorance of Jo&s;eph, on his cruel oppre&s;|&s;ion of the Hebrews, or on his de&s;potic government of his Egyptian &s;ubjects, which can afford in&s;truc|tion or entertainment &s;uited to the circum&s;tances of this free meeting?</Q>
However if we view the words more accurately, and enter fully into the &s;tory of which they are a part, we may, perhaps, judge, that none could have been more proper: That no topick could have given a finer lead to &s;uch &s;entiments, as are pe|culiarly adapted to an occa&s;ion like the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE Egyptians &s;eem to have been particularly hap|py, in along &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of native kings, from the reign of Mi&s;raim or Menes, the founder of the kingdom of Egypt, to the reign of Concharis or Timaeus, the twenty fifth king of Tanis or of the lower divi&s;ion of
<PB N="6" REF="013049_0004_0F8FF64094AC1570">
Egypt, for the term of about &s;ix centuries and a half<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;raim who was the fir&s;t king of Egypt, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have built Zoan, the &s;eat of the Egyptian kings, in tho&s;e early ages, and to have founded the kingdom of Egypt A. M. 1772. The conque&s;t of Egypt, by the Shepherds, is thought to have happen|ed, in the fifth year of the reign of Timaeus, A. M. 2420, which is 648 years later, near &s;ix centuries and a half. If we &s;hould reckon from the building of Noph or Memphis, and from the beginning of the reign of Naphtuhim, about A&punc; M. 1777, the period will include 643 years.</NOTE>. During this long period the Egyptians, (as did mo&s;t nations in the&s;e early times,) enjoyed great freedom, noble immunities and privileges. E&s;pecially, was this the ca&s;e, until the latter part of the reign of Thu&s;i|mares, the twentieth king of Tanis or of the lower divi&s;ion of Egypt. About the thirteenth year of his reign Jo&s;eph the Hebrew was advanced to the office of prime mini&s;ter in the court of Pharaoh. Near thir|teen years after his advancement, towards the clo&s;e of that remarkable famine, which then prevailed over Egypt, and all the neighbouring kingdoms, he bought the Egyptians them&s;elves, as he had their lands and cattle before. From this time they became the &s;er|vants and tenants of Pharaoh, and their former privi|leges &s;uffered a great eclip&s;e. They now held their lands of the crown, tilled them for Pharaoh, and gave a fifth of their increa&s;e, as an annual acknowledgement and tribute to their prince.</P>
<P>JOSEPH, who had been a father to Pharaoh, and to his &s;ubjects, &s;eemeth to have &s;upported his character, not only during the reign of Thu&s;imares, but al&s;o during the three &s;ucceeding reigns: and to have been prime mini&s;ter, in the courts of four princes &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, for the term of about eighty years.</P>
<P>THE government under his admini&s;tration, &s;eemeth to have been wi&s;e and gentle: and the people, though abridged of &s;ome, yet had many privileges left them.</P>
<P>THE great abilities and integrity of Jo&s;eph, with the eminent &s;ervices he had done in Egypt, rendered
<PB N="7" REF="013049_0005_0F8FF6430505F320">
his name and memory dear, both to the princes whom he had &s;erved, and to the people who&s;e &s;aviour, as well as ruler he had been. He had advanced the crown of Egypt to a &s;tate of grandeur and oppulence, which, before this time, had been unknown in that, and, perhaps, in every other kingdom.</P>
<P>LONG, no doubt, had the memory of Jo&s;eph and of his &s;ervices been precious, and his name been honour|ed by the Egyptian princes and their &s;ubjects, had a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of native kings continued to hold the &s;ceptre. Long, no doubt, the children of Jacob would, not only, have continued to flouri&s;h, but would, for his &s;ake, have obtained protection.</P>
<P>BUT about fifty years after his death, the kingdom was transferred to a foreigner.
<Q>Now there aro&s;e up a new King over Egypt, which knew not Jo&s;eph.</Q>
That is, a king of another family and nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Jo&s;ephus in his Antiquities, Book II, &s;aith, When the king|dom was transferred to another family the Egyptians treated the I&s;raelites inhumanly, contrived to oppre&s;s them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Other Hi&s;torians &s;ay, This new king, who knew not Jo&s;eph, was a foreigner, who with a numerous army of A&s;&s;yrians, or Phaenicians, or of the Arabians, or more probably of the ancient Horims invaded and conquered Egypt, and called them&s;elves Pa&s;tors or Shepherds. Shuckford's Con. Vol. II. P. 206&mdash;210.</P></NOTE>. This new or foreign king, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been Salatis, the fir&s;t of the Shepherd kings, as they are commonly called. He, about the fifth year of the reign of Con|charis or Timaeus, led a numerous army of foreigners, (probably the ancient Horites, whom the children of E&s;au, about this time, expelled from Mount Seir,) again&s;t Egypt. They marked their way with terrible &s;laughter and deva&s;tation. The inhabitants were &s;lain, their cities and hou&s;es laid in a&s;hes, and the country, unable to re&s;i&s;t the fury and valour of the&s;e bloody invaders, &s;oon made its &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The conquerors, advanced Salatis, their principal leader, to the throne. HE knew not JOSEPH. He was a &s;tranger to his per|&s;on and &s;ervices. He had no particular connections
<PB N="8" REF="013049_0006_0F8FF643EDA5C698">
with the Egyptians or Hebrews. He had contracted no particular friend&s;hip or regard for either. How dear &s;oever the benefactors and &s;aviours of their coun|try were to the native inhabitants, it little affected him Their good &s;ervices to a country, for who&s;e welfare, he cared nothing, could have little influence indeed with him. To maintain him&s;elf upon the throne, to which he had waded through blood and &s;laughter, to reward his friends, and fix them in his intere&s;t, (as is u&s;ually the ca&s;e in &s;uch revolutions,) was his &s;pecial care. He therefore di&s;tributed the lands among his &s;oldiers, en&s;laved the ancient inhabitants, &s;ubjected the country to tribute, and garri&s;oned it at plea&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shuckford's Connection, Vol. II, P. 205.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAD he been a native of the country, the intere&s;t of it would have been dear to him. A thou&s;and ten|der connections would have been formed with his countrymen. The intere&s;ts and happine&s;s of the na|tion would have been connected with his own, and in many re&s;pects in&s;eperable from them. To the coun|&s;els of the wi&s;e men of his country, to the religion, cu&s;toms, benefactors, and &s;aviours of it, he would have naturally paid a particular veneration and regard. The&s;e would have all united their influence in favour of a mild and happy government. But now they were all ca&s;t into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, and operated to aggrandize the conquerors, to en&s;lave and ruin the native inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE HEBREWS, who were &s;ettled chiefly in the lower Egypt, and were a brave, numerous, and flou|ri&s;hing people, and bid the faire&s;t to give trouble to the u&s;urper, and to re&s;tore the country to its ancient freedom, he took particular care to en&s;lave: and by every &s;pecies of tyranny to oppre&s;s and keep low. In a word, by the&s;e foreigners, the ancient form of go|vernment was wholly &s;ubverted, and the Egyptians from a free, flouri&s;hing and happy people, were reduc|ed to a &s;tate of &s;lavery and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013049_0007_0F8FF6441E1F78B8">FROM this hi&s;torical &s;ketch of the new king it will not be unnatural to remark,</P>
<P>THAT as the government of a people, by their free-born &s;ons, hath the happie&s;t tendency to main|tain and perpetuate their valuable rights and privi|leges; &s;o the introduction of foreigners, to civil rule, hath the mo&s;t efficacious tendency to &s;ubvert their con&s;titution, and to reduce them to a &s;tate of &s;lavery and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE illu&s;tration of this ob&s;ervation will naturally conduct me into &s;uch a field of di&s;cour&s;e, as, I flatter my&s;elf, could it be executed, in any mea&s;ure, equal to the nature and importance of the &s;ubject, would by no means fail to fix the attention of my audience, and agreeably to entertain them, on this joyful anni|ver&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE provi&s;ion made, by the infinitely wi&s;e LAW|GIVER, for the government of his cho&s;en people, by their brethren, who were trained up among them, and to prevent foreigners having any &s;hare in the govern|ment, cannot fail to throw light on this &s;ubject. He expre&s;sly commanded:
<Q>Thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e &s;et him king over thee, whom the LORD thy GOD &s;hall choo&s;e: one from among thy brethren &s;halt thou &s;et king over thee: thou maye&s;t not &s;et a &s;trang|er over thee, who is not thy brother</Q>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 17.15.</NOTE>. The principal rea&s;ons of this precept were, no doubt, That their king might always be a per&s;on united and con|nected with his &s;ubjects, by all the bonds of nature, religion, and friend&s;hip: That his intere&s;ts and hap|pine&s;s might be in&s;eperably connected with the inte|re&s;ts and happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects:&mdash;That from love to his country, to the religion and laws of it, and from a natural regard to his &s;ubjects, as brethren, he might rule for the general good:&mdash;That he might maintain and promote the true religion, &s;way the &s;cep|tre
<PB N="10" REF="013049_0008_0F8FF644D01078F8">
in righteou&s;ne&s;s, with gentlene&s;s and brotherly kind|ne&s;s, towards all his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE alwi&s;e and perfect GOVERNOR determined that &s;uch a per&s;on would be mo&s;t likely to an&s;wer the great ends of government: And that the con&s;tituting of &s;uch a per&s;on to rule and govern had the happi|e&s;t tendency to promote the common weal, and tran&s;|mit the privileges of his cho&s;en people entire to fu|ture times.</P>
<P>HE &s;aw that the introduction of a foreigner would have a tendency directly the rever&s;e. Therefore the Jewi&s;h Monarch might be no &s;tranger, no u&s;urper, but a native Jew, elected according to divine appoint|ment, by the general con&s;ent and &s;uffrages of his brethren, whom he was to govern.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the SUPREME LAWGIVER taught his people, That their Prince &s;hould be a man of truth, "hating covetou&s;ne&s;s," of known and approved a|bilities, "ju&s;t ruling in the fear of God"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 18.21. 2 Sam. 23.3.</NOTE>. He was prohibited to multiply hor&s;es or chariots, or greatly to hoard up &s;ilver and gold <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 17.16, 17.</NOTE>. GOD &s;aw that this would have a tendency to lift up his heart in pride, make him independent of his &s;ubjects, and put it in his hands to oppre&s;s and tyrannize over them.</P>
<P>FROM this view of the con&s;titution of the Jewi&s;h KING, by the SUPREME LAWGIVER, it is mo&s;t evi|dent, that He viewed it as a matter of great and high importance that tho&s;e who bear rule over others, &s;hould be their brethren, born among them; bound by all the ties of nature, friend&s;hip, intere&s;t, and re|ligion, to rule in righteou&s;ne&s;s: and to maintain, pro|mote, and perpetuate the privileges, immunities, and happine&s;s of their &s;ubjects. This He judged to have the mo&s;t happy tendency to promote and &s;ub&s;erve the&s;e noble ends. Nor could he think the privileges and happine&s;s of his people &s;ecure under the government
<PB N="11" REF="013049_0009_0F8FF645929A9A90">
of my foreigner or u&s;urper. Therefore He expre&s;sly forbiddeth the appointment of a &s;tranger, who was not an I&s;raelite, to be their king. He knew, that the bonds of nature, the alliances of friend&s;hip, that love and fondne&s;s for their native country, which, in a greater or le&s;s degree po&s;&s;e&s;s all men, would, in the ca&s;e of foreign princes, all unite their influence, with innumerable attendant circum&s;tances and con&s;equen|ces, to render them oppre&s;&s;ors and tyrants, and to re|duce their &s;ubjects to a &s;tate the mo&s;t wretched and mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE the &s;ame regulations were to be at|tended in the con&s;titution of all &s;ubordinate officers. It was commanded,
<Q>Thou &s;halt provide out of all the people able men, &s;uch as fear GOD, men of truth, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s: and place &s;uch over them, to be rulers of thou&s;ands, and rulers of hundreds, ru|lers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And Mo&s;es cho&s;e able men out of all I&s;rael and made them heads over the people, rulers of thou&s;ands, &amp;c</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 18.21, 25.</NOTE>. Mo&s;es &s;eemeth to have been fir&s;t directed to this by his fa|ther in Law; but it is evident from &s;everal Parts of the Scripture <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numb. 11.16, 17.</NOTE>, that it was done at the commandment of the LORD, by the general choice and &s;uffrage of the people.
<Q>Take ye wi&s;e men and under&s;tanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. And ye an&s;wered me and &s;aid, The thing which thou ha&s;t &s;poken, is good for us to do. So I took the chief of your tribes, wi&s;e men, and known, and made them heads over you, cap|tains over thou&s;ands, and captains over hundreds, captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes</Q>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 1.13, 14, 15.</NOTE>. Their officers were all to be of them&s;elves, men of great abilities, known and approved in their &s;everal tribes and cities, as men of real piety, of invincible veracity and integrity,
<PB N="12" REF="013049_0010_0F8FF6465BF7CE28">
of found wi&s;dom and real largene&s;s of heart: Men who knew what I&s;rael ought to do, and who would faithfully pur&s;ue the welfare of the people of God.</P>
<P>FROM this view of the Jewi&s;h con&s;titution, &s;o far as it was of a civil nature, it is mo&s;t evident, that &s;uch, and &s;uch only, were to be appointed to rule over them, from time to time, as were their brethren, acquainted with their genius and character, connected with them by nature, friend&s;hip, intere&s;t and religion: and every way &s;o circum&s;tanced, as that they &s;hould not only be the be&s;t able to promote the common good of the people of God; but as that they &s;hould be under the influence and con&s;traint, of all imaginable engage|ments and motives, to u&s;e all their abilities, opportu|nities, and advantages to make them great, religious, and happy.</P>
<P>FURTHER, as this was an appointment of the SU|PREME LAWGIVER, for the good of that favourite people who&s;e GOD and KING He was, it is mo&s;t cer|tain that the appointment of &s;uch men to civil rule hath the mo&s;t efficacious tendency to maintain and &s;ecure the rights of a people, and to tran&s;mit them en|tire to po&s;terity:&mdash;The noble&s;t tendency to make them a well governed, a free, a brave, a great, and flouri&s;h|ing people.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, as the choice of a &s;tranger is peremptorily forbidden, it is equally certain, that the appointment of foreigners hath directly the oppo&s;ite tendency: and is calculated, at once, to &s;trip a com|mon-wealth of every thing dear and valuable, and to reduce them to a &s;tate of &s;lavery and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject will receive further light, if we con|&s;ider, That it was threatened as a terrible cur&s;e <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 28.43, 44.</NOTE> up|on I&s;rael, that &s;trangers &s;hould rule over them: and that it is mentioned as a lamentable ca&s;e indeed, when there were none to lead them among all the &s;ons whom
<PB N="13" REF="013049_0011_0F8FF6471133E670">
they had brought up <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah 51.18.</NOTE>. On the other hand, it is pro|mi&s;ed as a rich ble&s;&s;ing, That
<Q>their nobles &s;hould be of them&s;elves, and that their governour &s;hould proceed from the mid&s;t of them</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 30.21.</NOTE>. But in what re&s;pects can the one be con&s;idered as a cur&s;e, or the other as a ble&s;&s;ing, in any view but this, That the tendency of the one was to make them mi&s;erable, and to deprive them of every thing dear and valuable, and of the other to make them free, pro&s;perous and happy?</P>
<P>AGAIN, the general thir&s;t of nations and communi|ties to be governed by their own &s;ons, and their great aver&s;ion to rulers of foreign extract demon&s;trate the ob&s;ervation, I am attempting to illu&s;trate, and &s;hew it to be agreeable to the common &s;en&s;e and experience of mankind.</P>
<P>THAT there is a &s;trong and univer&s;al thir&s;t in all nations and communities to be governed by their coun|trymen and acquaintance, is indi&s;putably evident from the &s;truggles, which they have univer&s;ally made to &s;upport their native princes and rulers, and to expel others. Where is the nation which hath not run to arms, and di&s;puted this matter at the point of the &s;word? How did the ancient nations of the ea&s;t con|tend with blood and fire for the privilege of being go|verned by their native princes? When the Romans began to extend their conque&s;ts in Italy, and when afterwards they alarmed the European nations with the terrour of their arms, how warmly did the various independent &s;tates and nations di&s;pute this privilege at the expence of their lives and fortunes? When foiled or vanqui&s;hed in one terrible engagement, how &s;oon did they rally again, and with a bravery and heroi&s;m peculiar to free and independent nations ru&s;h to new battles? E&s;teeming the privilege of being governed by their friends dearer than their trea&s;ures or blood.

Saith a fine modern writer,
<Q>The&s;e defended their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions with ob&s;tinate valour. It was by the &s;uperiority of their di&s;cipline rather than of their courage, that the Romans gained any advantage over them. The vanqui&s;hed people re&s;umed their arms with fre&s;h &s;pirit and their undi&s;ciplined valour animated by the love of liberty, &s;upplied the want of conduct as well as of union</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Robert&s;on in his hi&s;tory of Charles V.</NOTE>. How warm and bloody were the &s;truggles of the ancient Britons for the&s;e privileges when Julius Cae&s;ar <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Julius Cae&s;ar fir&s;t landed in Britain on the 26th of Augu&s;t, A. M. 3950, a little more than 54 years before the commence|ment of the Chri&s;tian Aera. The battles between him and the Britons were very ob&s;tinate and bloody, but the Romans, at la&s;t, by their &s;uperior &s;kill and di&s;cipline obtained the advantage, and got footing on the i&s;land. They remained here almo&s;t 500 years; a great part of which time, the Britons were their tributaries. They were, at times, intolerably oppre&s;&s;ed and mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly treated by the Romans: and at turns, for hundreds of years, they di&s;puted their liberties with them, with the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and in|vincible valour. In the reign of Nero A. D. 61, Boadicea, a Bri|ti&s;h Queen, who had been treated with in&s;ufferable inhumanity and outrage, by the Romans, drew together an army of 230000 Britons, to avenge her own, and her country's wrongs. She reduced &s;everal of the principal Roman cities, and put 70 or 80 thou&s;and Romans to the &s;word: But unfortunately engaging Suetonius the Roman general, in a narrow pa&s;s, &s;he was defeat|ed, with the lo&s;s of 80 thou&s;and men. The Romans took their final leave of Briton, A. D. 448. Very &s;oon after their departure, the Saxons began to tran&s;port them&s;elves into Britain, made &s;et|tlements, and in the fifth and &s;ixth centuries formed the Hep|tarchy, or &s;even Saxon kingdoms. They reduced the Britons to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, and employed them in all manner of drudgeries; particularly in cultivating tho&s;e very lands, for their foreign ma&s;ters, of which they had been the Proprietors. In the beginning of the ninth century Egbert put an end to the Hep|tarchy, and became the fir&s;t monarch of all England. The Danes began their Ravages in Britain about the year 832, and continu|ed them until 1013, when Swane or Swein, King of Denmark, made an entire conque&s;t of England, and was acknowledged as king. He died the next year, Feb. 3, 1014, after he had di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed the nation beyond all de&s;cription. Speed, &s;peaking of this time, hath this emphatical expre&s;&s;ion: "The&s;e were the days of England's mourning." His Son, Canute the great, was afterwards made king, and the Dani&s;h Government continued for three &s;hort reigns compri&s;ing in the whole about 29 years.</NOTE> made his di&s;cent upon the Briti&s;h I&s;land?&mdash;And afterwards, with the Saxons, Danes and Normans? How bravely did the Barons of England take up arms in the Reigns of King John, and of Henry the III, to drive foreigners from the courts of the nation, and to fill the &s;eats of Ju&s;tice with their acquaintance and free-born &s;ons? But what can be the language of all the&s;e bloody &s;trug|gles, of this univer&s;al thir&s;t of nations to be governed by their own children, but this, That the government of &s;tates and nations, by their own &s;ons and neigh|bours, hath the happie&s;t tendency to maintain and per|petuate their privileges: and that the introduction of
<PB N="15" REF="013049_0013_0F8FF648CEC1C560">
foreigners to civil government hath the mo&s;t efficaci|ous tendency, to &s;ubvert their con&s;titution, to en&s;lave and make them mi&s;erable? This then is agreeable to the univer&s;al &s;en&s;e and experience of mankind. The&s;e are &s;entiments written not in letters of gold, but in the far more expre&s;&s;ive characters of Human BLOOD.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, the hi&s;tory of ancient, as well as of later ages will reflect light upon this &s;ubject. No &s;ooner did foreigners po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of civil Rule in Egypt, than the ancient inhabitants, Egyptians, as well as Hebrews, lo&s;t their former freedom and &s;unk into a &s;tate of &s;lavery and wretchedne&s;s hardly to be de&s;cribed.

mi&s;ery did the introduction of foreigners to civil rule breed in the nation, in the reign of EDWARD the Con|fe&s;&s;or? Foreigners occupied all the great places of tru&s;t and importance in the kingdom, whether civil or religious. Saith a modern writer,
<Q>The Normans intercepted all the rays of regal favours, and ba&s;k|ed in the &s;plendours, which were cau&s;ed by the mu|nificence and revenues of the Engli&s;h.</Q>
Their per|nicious coun&s;els and influence, had, more than once, well nigh plunged the nation in all the calamities and horrours of a civil war.</P>
<P>THE dreadful effects of the government of foreign|ers, were &s;till more terribly felt in the reign of WIL|LIAM the Conqueror. Though he took the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn oaths, and &s;wore upon the relicks of the dead, to confirm to the nation all their ancient privileges, and to govern them by the laws of the land, yet, how were the ancient inhabitants, without the lea&s;t colour of law or ju&s;tice, deprived both of their lives and for|tunes? By him the native inhabitants were almo&s;t univer&s;ally deprived of every place of honour and tru&s;t, and Normans in every part of the kingdom in|troduced to civil rule, who paid little regard to law or ju&s;tice, and practi&s;ed almo&s;t every &s;pecies of op|pre&s;&s;ion and tyranny. Inferior officers treated the Engli&s;h gentry and nobility with in&s;olence, loaded the people with grievous exactions, and, in time of peace, plundered their hou&s;es, and ravi&s;hed their women, even with a &s;avage and brutal wantonne&s;s. And what is &s;till wor&s;e, this &s;cene of violence, outrage, and hor|rour, which nothing but cruelty could countenance, nothing but the mo&s;t barbarous &s;avagene&s;s could to|lerate, was connived at, if not favoured by the guar|dians of the realm.

The lands and arms of the Natives were taken from them, their hou|&s;es and churches con&s;umed with fire, and even the in|&s;truments of hu&s;bandry were wre&s;ted from their hands. Some parts of the country, for &s;ixty miles together, became a perfect wa&s;te and de&s;art, for many years.

Could this have been expected from a native Prince? Was the conduct of WILLIAM like this towards his own countrymen? By no means. While he appeared not only de&s;titute of all ju&s;tice, but of all humanity to|wards the Britons, he loaded them with every royal favour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>William the Conqueror, &s;ometimes called William the Ba&s;|tard, was the Ba&s;e-born &s;on of Robert, Duke of Normandy, a large and fruitful Province of France, about 200 miles in length, and 100 in breadth. The Normans and Danes made a conque&s;t of this country about the year 912 under one Rollo whom they created their fir&s;t Duke. William, their &s;eventh Duke, was nei|ther of Saxon or Dani&s;h Royal Blood, not doth it appear that he had any ju&s;t claim to the Briti&s;h Crown. However, having a&s;|&s;embled a numerous army he landed in England, near Ha&s;tings in Suffex, Sept. 28, 1066; where, on the 14th of October, com|ing to an engagement with Harold II, Son of the popular Earl Godwin, who had been lately elected King of England, after an ob&s;tinate and bloody battle, fought on both &s;ides with the great|e&s;t re&s;olution and mo&s;t unremitting ardour, from &s;even in the morning until in the Night, he obtained a compleat victory. Harold the Briti&s;h King with about 70000 of his men fell in the battle.</P>
<P>William was proclaimed King of England, and reigned almo&s;t 21 years. He governed without any regard to his Oaths, or to the ancient Laws and cu&s;toms of the Nation: introduced the Norman cu&s;toms and language, and all pleadings at the bar were in French. He treated the Engli&s;h with great inhumanity, cut|ting off the hands and feet of many thou&s;ands of the people, and de&s;troying all the North of England with fire and &s;word. Not le&s;s than 200000 Souls &s;eem either to have been put to the &s;word, to have been &s;tarved, or &s;ome how or other to have been de|&s;troyed by him, from the time of his invading England to his Demi&s;e, Sept. 9, 1087.

<P>THE appointment of Juries, in the Briti&s;h nation &s;eemeth to have been as early as the reign of ALFRED THE GREAT, about the clo&s;e of the ninth century.

The right of trials by juries hath been e&s;teemed as a privilege of ine&s;ti|mable worth, and as the very bulwark of Briti&s;h Li|berty, for many hundred years.

By this the privilege of trials by peers and ju|ries was put upon a more firm and permanent foot|ing. In this Britons glory and think them&s;elves hap|py above any other nation. But wherein lieth the mighty advantage, unle&s;s it be in this, That it &s;ecureth to every man a judgment by his countrymen and neighbours; in which, he may expect all the favour and protection, which his character and circum&s;tances in life, and which the laws of his country will ju&s;tly admit; and is delivered from the intrigues and par|tial determinations of foreigners: with whom his cha|racter and manner of life would have little or no in|fluence, to whom the laws of his country might be le&s;s known, and by whom they might be far le&s;s re|garded?</P>
<P>LASTLY, this point may receive &s;till further light, from a con&s;ideration of the e&s;teem, veneration, con|nections and friend&s;hips, which men contract for their native country, and from a con&s;ideration of the con&s;e|quences of &s;uch friend&s;hips and connections.</P>
<P>SUCH is human nature, that every man hath a pe|culiar regard for his own nation and country.

They feel them&s;elves &s;en&s;ibly intere&s;ted in their welfare, and it is not ea&s;ily that &s;uch a regard for their native land is obliterated, and the influence of it de&s;troyed. They con&s;ider it as the nation to which they are related by the ties of blood, as the country which gave them birth and nur&s;|ed their tender years. It is the country which hath extended to them the brea&s;ts of &s;cience, and enlightened their eyes with the knowledge of men and things. It
<PB N="21" REF="013049_0019_0F8FF64E919DC400">
is the country of their forefathers, which hath libe|rally poured it's favours on them and on their po&s;te|rity. It is the country under who&s;e laws and immu|nities, the religion, lives, fortunes, and every thing dear to their ance&s;tors or to them&s;elves, have been pro|tected and defended. It is the country in the defence of which they have expended both their trea&s;ures and their blood. To the religion, to the laws, cu&s;toms, and manners of it they have been trained from the tender years of Infancy. For them, by long u&s;e, they have contracted a particular regard and veneration. Here are the companions, the guides and protectors of their youth. Here are their neighbours, their friends, their honours, and all their great Intere&s;ts. Here are the people from whom they expect prefer|ment: The people for who&s;e coun&s;el, e&s;teem, and friend&s;hip, above all others they have a particular re|gard, and to who&s;e intere&s;ts and &s;ervice they are mo&s;t ready to be devoted. Here are the Graves and Bones of their Fathers; here they expect to leave their own, with all their friends and dear enjoyments on this &s;ide Heaven. Be&s;ides, if they are exalted to the &s;eats of Legi&s;lature or of Judgment, in a free &s;tate, the e&s;|teem friend&s;hip and &s;uffrages of their neighbours have fixed them in tho&s;e places of honour and tru&s;t. The friend&s;hip of their con&s;tituents, the confidence they place in their abilities, their dependance on their in|tegrity and faithfulne&s;s, the public manife&s;tations of honour and e&s;teem given them, cannot fail to influ|ence noble minds, to conciliate favour and engage fi|delity. Therefore all the ties of nature, of friend&s;hip, of honour, of intere&s;t, of gratitude and religion, unite their influence, and bind them to pur&s;ue the common good of their native country, the welfare of the great whole over which they pre&s;ide, and with which they are &s;pecially connected. When they act as Legi&s;la|tors, or &s;et on the Bench to determine cau&s;es civil or criminal, the&s;e all operate to produce LAWS the mo&s;t

wi&s;e and &s;alutary, and JUDGMENT the mo&s;t righteous and impartial. If they enact Laws for the &s;tate in general, or lift their hands to impo&s;e taxes, they at the &s;ame time make laws for their neighbours, for their friends, for their children and for them&s;elves: They impo&s;e no burden upon others, but what at the &s;ame time they lay, not only upon their neare&s;t friends, but even upon them&s;elves. Every motive, therefore, unit|eth it's influence, and operateth with its whole force to &s;ecure and promote the intere&s;t of the GREAT WHOLE.</P>
<P>If we view them on the Bench, it is their country|man, their neighbour, as well as fellow-creature, whom they are about to judge. Their neighbour and their country both &s;hare in their affections: they would injure neither, but do ju&s;tice to both. They are all attention to evidence, to law and equity, and every thing is &s;o circum&s;tanced, as to effect a righteous de|ci&s;ion, &s;o far as it can be in this imperfect &s;tate.</P>
<P>BESIDE, men educated in a country, mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed, (caeteris paribus,) to have a much better know|ledge of the laws, cu&s;toms, manners, genius and inte|re&s;t of the people, than any other man can be &s;up|po&s;ed to have. A thorough knowledge of the&s;e is of great importance in a Ruler. A man can hardly govern a family in any tolerable manner, without con|&s;ulting the intere&s;t, genius, and manners of it. Much le&s;s can a common wealth or kingdom be govern|ed without the knowledge of them. But &s;ome of the&s;e are to be learned, rather by acquaintance, ob&s;ervation, and experience, than by reading or &s;tudy.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations therefore, at once, &s;hew us, in a &s;triking point of light, that the government of a people by their free-born &s;ons hath the happie&s;t tendency to maintain and perpetuate all their valuable rights and privileges.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, all the&s;e things, in the ca&s;e of a foreigner, or of one who is independent of the peo|ple whom he governeth, and wholly dependent on o|thers,

<P>SUCH Rulers are blinded by the foreign &s;upport and honours they receive, by the foreign friend&s;hips and connections, which they have made, by the parti|al regard they have imbibed for their native land, and they are, by the&s;e, as it were bribed and bought off from the intere&s;ts of the people whom they go|vern. They by no means view things impartially: and it is but an ill chance, which people have of being governed in a mild and righteous manner, or of hav|ing their conduct and grievances fairly repre&s;ented to courts abroad, on whom they are dependent, and whom to deceive it is but too often their great in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>IT may be well ob&s;erved here, That if rulers are made independent of the people whom they govern&punc; and wholly dependent on others, in a di&s;tant country, if their connections, friend&s;hips, and intere&s;ts are there, the effects will be much the &s;ame, as in the ca&s;e of a foreigner in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e. The circum&s;tance of their being born within the empire, in &s;ome other country, many thou&s;and miles di&s;tant from the peo|ple over whom they bear rule, will not greatly help the matter. The circum&s;tances and cau&s;es being near|ly the &s;ame, the effects will be &s;imilar.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;repre&s;entations which have been made of the American Colonies, at the Court of GREAT BRI|TAIN, and the great partiality with which the Ame|ricans have been treated, in the late &s;truggles for li|berty, will evince the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations. How have di&s;orders merely trifling, in America, been magnified and &s;welled into high Trea&s;on, by the par|tial repre&s;entations of &s;uch rulers and their ba&s;e mi|nions? How have the di&s;turbances of a few children or imprudent &s;allies of a young rabble, which a grand juror or common con&s;table might have &s;tilled, and a

Briti&s;h &s;leets have been di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and leagues, and troops collected from various parts of the globe to curb and cha&s;ti&s;e the rebels.</P>
<P>IS not all this done without giving the party accu|&s;ed, though whole towns, yea whole communities of people, the lea&s;t hearing or trial? How unlike to this is the treatment which Britons receive in the Parent State? Do not &s;uch riots and mobs as Americans ne|ver &s;aw, and even in&s;ults of Maje&s;ty it&s;elf, pa&s;s often there unnoticed by admini&s;tration? Not a &s;lave can be puni&s;hed there, but upon a verdict of twelve jurors of the neighbourhood, on a fair trial. But alas! Are not Americans, at the di&s;tance of three thou&s;and miles, in effect, condemned unheard and treated as rebels? If Americans are &s;uppo&s;ed to be guilty of a mi&s;demean|our towards the Parent State, are not their towns in|ve&s;ted with &s;hips of War, and mu&s;t not examination of the matter be had under the mouths of cannon, and before the points of &s;word and bayonet? If under the&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances, any grounds of pro|ce&s;s can be found, is it not ordered that the &s;uppo&s;ed criminal &s;hall be dragged acro&s;s the Atlantic, be at the expen&s;e of tran&s;porting evidences to GREAT BRI|TAIN, and undergo a trial, even for life before &s;trang|ers? What a wretched chance indeed hath a man for his life, though ever &s;o innocent, in circum&s;tances like the&s;e! On the mo&s;t favourable &s;uppo&s;ition that he is at la&s;t acquitted, he and his family are reduced to beggary: to be &s;ure unle&s;s his fortune be more affluent than Americans can commonly boa&s;t. At any rate, condemned or acquitted, he is undone. Are Britons thus u&s;ed in the Parent State? Would they brook &s;uch treatment as this?&mdash;Yet alas! is not all this right and con&s;titutional with regard to their Ame|rican brethren?</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="013049_0023_0F8FF651929DA3E8">FURTHER, it may be ob&s;erved, that when a peo|ple are governed by their own country men, cho&s;en by the &s;uffrages of the free-men whom they govern, they are ordinarily &s;ome of the mo&s;t able, religious, faith|ful men in the land, and they will be careful to fill the places of all inferior officers, with men of good abilities, and of good lives.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, when this is not the ca&s;e, they are but too often of an ill character: either the dependents of the great, &s;hifted off to governments a|broad, to ea&s;e them of the trouble of their &s;upport; or they are reduced Officers, exalted to government to get a piece of bread and advance their for|tunes. Men too often trained to vice, &s;kilful in butchering the Human Species, de&s;titute of the tender feelings of the human heart, ma&s;ters of intrigue and corruption, as unpracti&s;ed in virtue as they are ac|cu&s;tomed to vice, as untaught to govern, as they are artful at intrigue and corruption. Too often are they children in abilities to tho&s;e they govern: men whom the &s;uffrages of a religious and free people would ne|ver advance to the lowe&s;t office in a &s;tate: and through their influence men of the like character are introduc|ed to all places of inferior tru&s;t. When this is the ca&s;e, how dreadful are the con&s;equences? The chief rulers are the great examples and patterns of vice and op|pre&s;&s;ion.

And what maketh the ca&s;e &s;till more deplor|able, is, That if by oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice, the peo|ple are provoked to unwarrantable and &s;editious mea|&s;ures, in&s;tead of redre&s;&s;ing their grievances, and quiet|ing their &s;pirits, by the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, the &s;word is drawn again&s;t them, and they are

butchered by hundreds, with the &s;ame fiercene&s;s and barbarity, with which men trained to revenge, &s;laugh|ter and blood, de&s;troy their mo&s;t implacable enemies.</P>
<P>BUT in colonies governed by their native rulers, no &s;uch in&s;urrections are rai&s;ed, no &s;uch bloody &s;cenes are perpetrated. The people love and venerate their ru|lers.

The rulers and the ruled &s;eek the honour and happine&s;s of each other, and mutually re|joice in the common weal.</P>
<P>THUS we have clear and &s;triking evidence, That the government of a people by their own country-men and neighbours, cho&s;en by common con&s;ent, hath the happie&s;t tendency to &s;ecure and perpetuate the privi|leges, freedom and happine&s;s or communities; and that the introduction of foreigners, or of per&s;ons in|dependent of the people whom they govern, is calcu|lated, at once, to &s;trip them of every valuable enjoy|ment, and to render them &s;ervile and mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>IT will be nece&s;&s;ary, before I improve the &s;ubject, ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, That when per&s;ons become entirely naturali|zed, &amp; have fixed their intere&s;ts, connections, alliances, &amp; friend&s;hips in a country, and become equally connected with it, and dependent upon it, with the natives them|&s;elves; as is often the ca&s;e, they are no more to be con&s;i|dered as foreigners: and it is far from the de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e to maintain or in&s;inuate, that they may not, with the &s;ame &s;afety, as any other men what&s;oever, be cho&s;en into places or tru&s;t, if in other re&s;pects they are equally qualified.

That foreigners have &s;ome times governed well: For there can be no ju&s;t arguing from particulars to gene|rals, from extraordinary and exempt ca&s;es, to what may generally be expected.</P>

They are not only members of our civil, but of our re|ligious communities: members of our churches, bound by bapti&s;m, by a per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion of CHRISTIANI|TY, by &s;acramental vows, and the mo&s;t &s;acred engage|ments to GOD and men, to &s;eek their good, and the general good of their fellow men.

Their experience, &s;uperior wi&s;dom and penetration have compiled for us a mo&s;t excellent &s;y&s;tem of LAWS, founded on the great principles of liberty, ju&s;tice, and religion. Their government is mild and righteous: and as they do not govern to get their bread and ad|vance their fortunes, at the ruin of ours, and as they can lay no burdens on us, without bearing the &s;ame weight them&s;elves, their government is as remarkable for the little expence of it, as it is for it's gentlene&s;s, impartiality and righteou&s;ne&s;s. All our expences, by way of &s;alary <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The whole amount of the &s;alaries paid annually by the go|vernment is only &pound;. 580. The Salary of the Governor is &pound;. 300, of the Deputy Governour &pound;. 100, of the Secretary &pound;. 20, and of the Trea&s;urer &pound; 160. The Judges of the Superior Court have no &s;alary from the government. The Chief Judge is allowed 18 &s;hillings per day, and the four &s;ide Judges have 17 &s;hillings each per day. This court is obliged by law, to &s;et 14 weeks annually, and commonly &s;etteth, by adjournment, much longer, and the co&s;t of it is about &pound;. 600 per annum.

The avails of it, together with the forfeitures, for the &s;ame term, with proper allowances for &s;uch as may not be recovered, amount to &pound;. 2200: So that the Superior Court is of no co&s;t, at pre&s;ent, to the Colony, con&s;idered as a Government. In &s;hort the whole expence of go|vernment in Connecticut is trifling. The co&s;t of the General A&s;&s;embly annually is about &pound;. 1500. A rate of one penny on the pound, on the Grand Li&s;t, which rai&s;eth about &pound;. 6000 per An|num, near the one half of which is annually taken out of the Trea|&s;ury for Schooling, hath of late years been &s;ufficient to defray all our publick charges as a Government.</NOTE> to civil officers, do not, I imagine, a|mount annually, by con&s;iderable, to the one half of the &s;alary of a king's governour, in any of the neighbour|ing Provinces. Our lives and fortunes, all our privi|leges civil and religious are in a very happy manner &s;ecured.</P>
<P>WE have the greate&s;t religious, as well as civil pri|vileges. We enjoy liberty of con&s;cience in the com|pleate&s;t &s;en&s;e. No man is per&s;ecuted for his religion:

<P>THE Go&s;pel is preached among us with light and power. We enjoy our Sabbaths and all go&s;pel or|dinances and privileges. Happy indeed &s;hall we be if we "receive not" this "GRACE of GOD in vain."</P>

<P>WHILE therefore we con&s;ider how great are our pri|vileges and enjoyments, and from whom they are all derived, can we but reflect, How great are our obliga|tions to the mo&s;t grateful &s;entiments, even on the bend|ed knees of our hearts, to offer our devoute&s;t acknow|ledgments of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to GOD, the great author and giver of them?

than for us.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="013049_0028_0F8FF657A5EF8C40">ANOTHER thought which the preceeding &s;entiments &s;ugge&s;t, is this, That all po&s;&s;ible care, and every pro|per mea&s;ure, &s;hould be taken to prevent foreigners, and all others, who are independent of a people, from hav|ing any part in government, and to keep civil rulers, as much as po&s;&s;ible dependent on the people whom they govern, and intimately connected with them.</P>
<P>NOT only the repre&s;entations made, and horrible deeds related in this di&s;cour&s;e, but the hi&s;tory of all na|tions and ages will teach us, that nothing can be more fatal to the civil rights and happine&s;s of a people than the government of &s;trangers, and of rulers independent of the people whom they govern. When the govern|ment of a &s;tate is put into the hands of men unconnect|ed with them, un&s;upported by them, who&s;e intimate friends and &s;pecial connections, are in a different coun|try, and who receive ample &s;upport from another quarter, they may well expect oppre&s;&s;ion, inju&s;tice, the lo&s;s of liberty, and almo&s;t every civil mi&s;chief. As this becometh the ca&s;e with America, or with her &s;everal provinces and governments, may not SHE, and THEY expect to bid farewel to that liberty, to tho&s;e happy times and days, which we and our fathers have &s;een? As things are verging towards this, are not our liber|ties, by little and little, crumbling away, and is not our happine&s;s drawing to a clo&s;e?</P>
<P>EVERY free &s;tate therefore &s;hould maintain a mo&s;t vigilant care and guard again&s;t foreign, or independent rulers, and again&s;t all &s;uch mea&s;ures as are calculated to introduce them, and impo&s;e them upon a people. The very fir&s;t &s;tep this way, ought thoroughly to rou&s;e, thoroughly to alarm them.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould al&s;o be the particular care of every civil community to keep their rulers as much as po&s;&s;ible de|pendent on them, and intimately connected with them. For this purpo&s;e it will be highly politic, in every free &s;tate, to keep property as equally divided among the inhabitants as po&s;&s;ible, and not to &s;uffer a few per&s;ons
<PB N="31" REF="013049_0029_0F8FF6585139ED68">
to ama&s;s all the riches and wealth of a country: and al|&s;o to have a &s;pecial care how they adopt any laws, cu&s;|toms, or precedents, which have a tendency this way. For when men become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Wealth of a &s;tate, it will be in their power to purcha&s;e, or by undue influence, which, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, they may have ways almo&s;t innumerable, to thru&s;t them&s;elves into all places of honour and tru&s;t. This will put it in their power, by fraud or force to keep them&s;elves in tho&s;e important po&s;ts, and to oppre&s;s and tyrannize over their fellow men. It will teach the people to look up to them, as to lords and ma&s;ters, make them &s;ervile, and by little and little it will de&s;poil them of all true liber|ty and freedom. But on the other hand, the keeping of property, as equally divided as po&s;&s;ible among a people, will make elections more free, the rulers more dependent, and the liberty and privileges of the ruled va&s;tly more &s;ecure.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, will not our &s;ubject direct us to this enquiry, Whether the erecting of Courts, and the mak|ing of civil rulers independent of the people, whom they re&s;pect and govern, are not incon&s;i&s;tent with the original great de&s;ign of Government, incon&s;i&s;tent with the great and unchangeable RULES of RIGHTEOUSNESS, and incompatible with the important RIGHTS, which GOD and Nature have given, in common, to mankind?</P>
<P>Is it not the dictate of rea&s;on and of the will of GOD, That the original great de&s;ign of civil Government is the good of the community? The maintaining and &s;e|curing the rights, liberties, privileges and immunities of mankind? The impartial and faithful admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice? Mu&s;t not what&s;oever therefore, tendeth to deprive mankind of the&s;e important rights, and to prevent the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, be con|trary to the great de&s;ign of government, and &s;ubver&s;ive of it's noble in&s;titution? But is not this the ca&s;e, when rulers are made wholly independent of the people, when &s;trangers unconnected with them, and indepen|dent

Is not this calculated to deprive a people of liberty and ju&s;|tice; &mdash;to render life, property, and every dear enjoy|ment very precarious; and to reduce them to a &s;tate of &s;lavery and mi&s;ery, in&s;tead of making them free and happy? Is it not an infraction of the great and un|changeable LAWS of Nature, Rea&s;on, and Religion?&mdash; Incompatible with the e&s;&s;ential rights of mankind? How incon&s;i&s;tent is this with the con&s;titution of the SUPREME LAWGIVER for the good of his cho&s;en peo|ple? Did he not command, That all their rulers &s;hould be dependent upon their brethren and mo&s;t intimately connected with them? HE &s;aid al&s;o,
<Q>Thou &s;halt take no gift; for the gift blindeth the wi&s;e, and pervert|eth the Words of the righteous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 23.8.</NOTE>.</Q>
But if any gift tendeth to pervert judgment, if &s;o &s;mall a gift as one neighbour may ordinarily be&s;tow on another, is a pre|cious &s;tone in the eyes, will not hundreds or thou&s;ands &s;terling much more have this tendency? Will not &s;uch &s;howers of gold and &s;ilver overwhelm rea&s;on, con|found the judgment, and prove not only a &s;tone in the eyes, but even render them totally dark and blind? Have not Courts and civil rulers con&s;tituted, in a manner, wholly independent of the people, ever been the public fountains of oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice? Have they not, in&s;tead of defending the lives and liberties of mankind, wantonly deprived them of both?
