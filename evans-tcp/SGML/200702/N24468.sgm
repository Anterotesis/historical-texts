<HEAD>Love and Patrioti&s;m! OR, THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF M. DUPORTAIL, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM a very &s;ingular publication, which few of our readers will have an opportunity of &s;eeing, we give the following &s;tory. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to preface it by narrating a few particu|lars which are intimately connected with the hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>It was in the year 1783 that the baron de Faublas arrived in Paris, where he had re&s;olved to place his daughter in a convent. He was accompanied by his &s;on the chevalier de Faublas. After remaining &s;ome weeks in the capital, the baron, by the per|&s;ua&s;ion of his intimate friend, M. Duportail, came to the re&s;olution of re&s;iding &s;ome years in Paris, for the purpo&s;e of giving the be&s;t education to the only heir of his name, and of &s;uperintending the
<PB N="4" REF="032388_0003_0FF20D732CC3B398">
happine&s;s of a daughter whom he loved. The young chevalier was &s;oon initiated into all the fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;ipation of the metropolis; his accompli&s;hments were the admiration of the other &s;ex, and the envy of his own. But while indulging in the&s;e criminal pur&s;uits, a pa&s;&s;ion of a purer kind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the empire of his heart. In the cour&s;e of his vi&s;its to the convent, he had &s;een and loved mademoi&s;elle Sophia de Pontis, the amiable friend of his &s;i&s;ter. The heart of Sophia yielded to the attractions of the chevalier; their pa&s;&s;ions was reciprocal. The baron was not long ignorant of their attachment; his &s;on's vi&s;its to the convent were prohibited, and he was given to under&s;tand, that the daughter of M. Duportail was de&s;tined for his wife. What little he knew of this lady he had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from having overheard a conver&s;ation be|tween M. Duportail and his father, from which it appeared, that the former had long mourned a lo&s;t daughter. He farther under&s;tood, that as &s;oon as his education was completed at Paris, it was his father's intention that he &s;hould &s;et out on his travels; that he was to remain for &s;ome months in Poland, and that during his re&s;idence in that country, he was to be employed in making enquiry re&s;pecting the fate of the daughter of M. Duportail, and if &s;he yet lived, in endeavouring to re&s;tore her to her afflicted father. An opportunity was &s;oon
<PB N="5" REF="032388_0004_0FF1D645A3658218">
after embraced by M. Duportail of communicating to the chevalier the particulars of his &s;tory, which we now pre&s;ent to our readers.</P>
<P>My hi&s;tory pre&s;ents a frightful example of the in&s;tability of fortune. It is indeed very flattering, but it is al&s;o &s;ometimes very dangerous, to have an ancient title to &s;u&s;tain and a large e&s;tate to pre|&s;erve. The &s;ole de&s;cendant of an illu&s;trious family, who&s;e origin is lo&s;t in the darkne&s;s of remote ages, I have a right to a&s;pire to, and to occupy the fir&s;t employments in the republic which gave me birth, and yet I behold my&s;elf condemned to langui&s;h in a foreign country, amid&s;t an indolent and inglorious ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The name of Lovzin&s;ki is honourably mentioned in the annals of Poland, and that name is about to peri&s;h with my&s;elf: I know that an au&s;tere philo&s;ophy either rejects or de&s;pi&s;es vain titles and corrupting riches, and perhaps I &s;hould con&s;ole my&s;elf if I had lo&s;t only the&s;e; but, my young friend, I weep for an adored &s;pou&s;e, I &s;earch after a beloved daughter, and I &s;hall never more re-vi&s;it my native land. What courage is capable of oppo&s;ing griefs like mine?</P>
<P>My father, the baron de Lovzin&s;ki, &s;till more di&s;tingui&s;hed by his virtues than by his rank, enjoyed that con&s;ideration at court, which the
<PB N="6" REF="032388_0005_0FF20D452FBFFBD8">
favour of the prince always confers, and which per&s;onal merit &s;ometimes obtains. He be&s;towed all the attention of a tender parent on the educa|tion of my two &s;i&s;ters; and in regard to mine, he occupied him&s;elf with the zeal of a man of family, jealous of the honour of his hou&s;e, of which I was the &s;ole hope, and with the activity of a good citizen, who de&s;ires nothing &s;o ardently as to leave to the &s;tate a &s;ucce&s;&s;or worthy of him.</P>
<P>While I was pur&s;uing my &s;tudies at War&s;aw, the young P&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Tran&s;lator thinks that he can venture to pronounce M. de P&mdash;to be the nobleman who was formerly called Count <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and who lately &s;o worthily filled the throne of Poland.</NOTE> di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf among the re&s;t of my companions by the mo&s;t amiable qualities. To the charms of a per&s;on at once noble and engaging, he joined the graces of a cultivated under&s;tanding. The uncommon addre&s;s which he di&s;played among us young warriors; that rare mo|de&s;ty with which he &s;eemed de&s;irous to conceal his own merit from him&s;elf, on purpo&s;e to exalt the abilities of his le&s;s fortunate rivals, who were generally vanqui&s;hed by him in all our exerci&s;es; the urbanity of his manners, and the &s;weetne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, fixed the attention, commanded the e&s;teem, and rendered him the darling of that
<PB N="7" REF="032388_0006_0FF20D5FAD811FC8">
illu&s;trious band of young nobility, who partook of our &s;tudies and our plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that it was the re&s;emblance of our characters, and the &s;ympathy of our di&s;po&s;itions that occa&s;ioned my attachment to M. de P. would be to pay my&s;elf too flattering a compliment; however that may be, we both lived together in the mo&s;t intimate familiarity.</P>
<P>How happy, but how fleeting is that time of life, when one is unacquainted with ambition, which &s;acrifices every thing to the de&s;ire of fortune, and the glory that follows in her train, and with love, the &s;upreme power of which ab&s;orbs and concen|tres all our faculties upon one &s;ole object! that age of innocent plea&s;ures, and of confident credu|lity, when the heart, as yet a novice, freely follows the impul&s;e of youthful &s;en&s;ibility, and be&s;tows it&s;elf unre&s;ervedly upon the object of di&s;intere&s;ted affection! Then, my dear Faublas, then friend&s;hip is not a vain name!</P>
<P>The confident of all the &s;ecrets of M. de P&mdash;, I my&s;elf undertook nothing without fir&s;t intru&s;ting him with my de&s;igns; his councils regu|lated my conduct, mine determined his re&s;olu|tions; our youth had on plea&s;ures which were not &s;hared, no misfortunes which were not &s;olaced by our mutual attachment.</P>
<P>With what chagrin did I not perceive that fatal

moment arrive, when my friend, obliged by the commands of a father to depart from War&s;aw, prepared to take leave of me! We promi&s;ed to pre&s;erve for ever that lively affection which had con&s;tituted the chief happine&s;s of our youth, and I ra&s;hly &s;wore that the pa&s;&s;ions of a more advanced age &s;hould never alter it.</P>
<P>What an immen&s;e void did the ab&s;ence of M. de P&mdash;leave in my heart! At fir&s;t it appeared that nothing could compen&s;ate for his lo&s;s; the tenderne&s;s of a father, the care&s;&s;es of my &s;i&s;ters, affected me but feebly. I thought that no other method remained for me to di&s;&s;ipate the irk&s;ome|ne&s;s of my &s;ituation, than to occupy my lei&s;ure moments with &s;ome u&s;eful pur&s;uit. I therefore cultivated the French language, already e&s;teemed throughout all Europe; I read with delight tho&s;e famous works, the eternal monuments of genius, which it had produced; and I wondered that, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch an ungrateful idiom, &s;o many celebrated poets, &s;o many excellent philo&s;ophers and hi&s;torians, ju&s;tly immortalized, had been able to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by its means.</P>
<P>I al&s;o applied my&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to the &s;tudy of geometry; I formed my mind in a particular manner to the pur&s;uit of that noble profe&s;&s;ion which makes a hero at the expen&s;e of one hundred thou&s;and unfortunates, and which men le&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="032388_0008_0FF1D62EDE094138">
humane than valiant have called the grand art of war! Several years were employed in the&s;e pur|&s;uits, which are equally difficult and laborious; in &s;hort, they &s;olely occupied my thoughts. M. de P&mdash;, who often wrote to me, no longer received any but &s;hort replies, and our corre&s;pon|dence began to langui&s;h by neglect, when at length love fini&s;hed the triumph over friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>My father had been for a long time intimately connected with count Pulau&s;ki. Celebrated for the au&s;terity of his manners, famous on account of the inflexibility of his virtues, which were truly republican, Pulau&s;ki, at once a great captain and a brave &s;oldier, had on more than one occa&s;ion &s;igna|li&s;ed his fiery courage, and his ardent patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>In&s;tructed in ancient literature, he had been taught by hi&s;tory the great le&s;&s;ons of a noble di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s, an immovable con&s;tancy, an ab&s;olute devotion to glory. Like tho&s;e heroes to whom idolatrous, but grateful Rome, elevated altars, Pulau&s;ki would have &s;acrificed all his property to the pro&s;perity of his country; he would have &s;pilled the la&s;t drop of his blood for its defence; he would even have immolated his only, his beloved daughter, Lodoi&s;ka.</P>
<P>Lodoi&s;ka! how beautiful! how lovely! her dear name is always on my lips, her adored remem|brance will live for ever in my heart!</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="032388_0009_0FF20D7A325A55C8">My friend, from the fir&s;t moment that I &s;aw this fair maid, I lived only for her; I abandoned my &s;tudies; friend&s;hip was entirely forgotten. I con&s;ecrated all my moments to Lodoi&s;ka. My father and her's could not be long ignorant of my attachment; they did not chide me for it;&mdash;they mu&s;t have approved it then. This idea appeared to me to be &s;o well founded, that I delivered my&s;elf up, without &s;u&s;picion, to the &s;weet pa&s;&s;ion that enchanted me; and I took my mea&s;ures &s;o well that I beheld Lodoi&s;ka almo&s;t daily, either at home, or in company with my &s;i&s;ters, who loved her tenderly:&mdash;two &s;weet years flew away in this manner.</P>
<P>At length Pulau&s;ki took me one day a&s;ide, and addre&s;&s;ed me thus: Your father and my&s;elf have formed great hopes of you, which your conduct has hitherto ju&s;tified; I have long beheld you employing your youth in &s;tudies equally u&s;eful and honourable. To day&mdash;(He here perceived that I was about to interrupt him). What would you &s;ay? do you think to tell me any thing that I am unacquainted with? do you think that I have occa&s;ion to be the hourly witne&s;s of your tran&s;|ports, to learn how much my Lodoi&s;ka merits to be beloved! It is becau&s;e I know as well as you the value of my daughter, that you never &s;hall obtain her but by meriting her. Young man, learn that
<PB N="11" REF="032388_0010_0FF20D7BEBAA4C88">
it is not &s;ufficient that our foibles &s;hould be legiti|mate to be excu&s;able! tho&s;e of a good citizen ought to be turned entirely to the profit of his country; love, even love it&s;elf, like the ba&s;e&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ions, is either de&s;picable or dangerous, if it does not offer to generous hearts an additional motive to excite them towards honour.</P>
<P>Hear me: Our monarch, for a long time in a &s;ickly habit of body, &s;eems at length to approach towards his end. His life, become every day more precarious, has awakened the ambition of our neighbours.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ru&s;&s;ians.</NOTE> They doubtle&s;s prepare to &s;ow divi&s;ions among us; and they think, that by over|awing our &s;uffrages, they will be enabled to force upon us a king of their own choo&s;ing. Foreign troops have already dared to appear on the fron|tiers of Poland; already two thou&s;and Poli&s;h gentlemen have a&s;&s;embled, on purpo&s;e to puni&s;h their audacious in&s;olence. Go and join your&s;elf with tho&s;e brave youths; go, and at the end of the campaign, return covered with the blood of our enemies, and &s;hew to Pulau&s;ki a &s;on-in-law worthy of him.^a</P>
<P>I did not he&s;itate a &s;ingle moment; my father approved of my re&s;olutions, but being unable to con&s;ent without pain to my precipitate departure,
<PB N="12" REF="032388_0011_0FF20D81616E6150">
he pre&s;&s;ed me for a long time again&s;t his bo&s;om, while a tender &s;olicitude was depicted in all his looks; his adieus &s;eemed to be inau&s;picious; the trouble that agitated his heart, &s;eized upon my own; our tears were mingled on his venerable cheeks.</P>
<P>Pulau&s;ki, who was pre&s;ent at this moving &s;cene, logically reproached us for what he termed a weakne&s;s. Dry up your tears, &s;aid he to me, or pre&s;erve them for Lodoi&s;ka; it belongs only to childi&s;h lovers who &s;eparate them&s;elves from each other for five or &s;ix months, to weep in this manner! He in&s;tructed his daughter, in my pre&s;ence, both of my departure, and of the motives which had determined me to it. (Lodoi&s;ka grew pale, &s;ighed, looked at her father with a face &s;uffu&s;ed with blu&s;hes, and then a&s;&s;ured me in a trembling voice, that her vows &s;hould be offered up for my &s;afe return, and that her happine&s;s depended upon the &s;afety of Lovzin&s;ki.)</P>
<P>Encouraged in this manner, what dangers had I to fear? I departed accordingly, but in the cour&s;e of that campaign, there happened nothing worthy of narration; the enemy, equally careful with our&s;elves to avoid any action which might pro|duce an open war between the two nations, con|tented them&s;elves with fatiguing us by means of frequent marches: we, on the other hand, bounded
<PB N="13" REF="032388_0012_0FF20D86C7AD3D90">
our views to following and ob&s;erving them; and they only &s;eemed to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to us, in tho&s;e parts where the open country afforded them an ea&s;y opportunity of making good their retreat.</P>
<P>At the end of the campaign, they prepared to retire, on purpo&s;e to take up their winter quarters in their own country; and our little army, com|po&s;ed almo&s;t wholly of gentlemen, &s;eparated &s;oon after.</P>
<P>I returned to War&s;aw, full of joy and impa|tience; I thought that Love and Hymen were about to be&s;tow Lodoi&s;ka on me.&mdash;Alas! I no longer had a father. I learned, on entering the capital, that Lovzin&s;ki died of an apoplexy on the night before my arrival. Thus I was deprived of even the &s;ad con&s;olation of receiving the la&s;t &s;ighs of the mo&s;t tender of parents; I could only offer up my &s;orrows at his tomb, which I bathed with my tears!</P>
<P>&mdash;It is not, &s;ays Pulau&s;ki to me, who was but little moved with my profound &s;orrow; it is not by means of barren tears that you can do honour to a father &s;uch as thine. Poland in him regrets a citizen-hero, who would have been of immen&s;e &s;ervice during the critical moment which now approaches. Worn out with a tedious malady, our monarch has not a fortnight to live, and on
<PB N="14" REF="032388_0013_0FF20D8C1BBC4010">
the choice of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or depends the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of our fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>Of all the rights which the death of your father tran&s;mits to you, the mo&s;t noble is undoubtedly that of a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the diet, in which you are to repre&s;ent him; it is there where he will revive in you; it is there, where you ought to exhibit a courage infinitely more difficult to be &s;u&s;tained than that which con&s;i&s;ts only in braving death in the field of battle!</P>
<P>The valour of a &s;oldier is nothing more than a common virtue; but they are not ordinary men who on awful emergencies, pre&s;erving a tranquil courage, and di&s;playing an active penetration, di&s;cover the projects of the powerful who cabal, di&s;concert the enterpri&s;es of the intriguing, and confront the de&s;igns of the factious; who, always firm, incorruptible, and ju&s;t, give not their &s;uffra|ges but to tho&s;e whom they think mo&s;t worthy of them; whom neither gold nor promi&s;es can &s;educe, whom prayers cannot bend, whom menaces cannot terrify.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the virtues which di&s;tingui&s;hed your father, this is the precious inheritance which you ought to be de&s;irous of &s;u&s;taining. The day on which the &s;tates a&s;&s;emble for the election of a king, will be the epoch on which the preten&s;ions of many of our fellow-citizens, more occupied with their
<PB N="15" REF="032388_0014_0FF20D786A2B9010">
private intere&s;ts than jealous of the pro&s;perity of their country, will be manife&s;ted, as well as the pernicious de&s;igns of the neighbouring powers, who&s;e cruel policy it is to de&s;troy our &s;trength by dividing it.</P>
<P>I am deceived, my friend, if the fatal moment is not fa&s;t approaching, which will for ever fix the de&s;tiny of our country&mdash;its enemies have con&s;pired its ruin; they have &s;ecretly prepared for a revo|lution;&mdash;but they &s;hall not con&s;ummate their purpo&s;es while my arm can &s;u&s;tain a &s;word! May that God, who is the protector of the republic, prevent all the horrors of a civil war! But that extremity, however frightful it appears, may perhaps become nece&s;&s;ary; I flatter my&s;elf that it will be but a &s;hort, although perhaps a violent cri&s;is, after which the regenerated &s;tate will a&s;&s;ume its ancient &s;plendor.</P>
<P>You &s;hall &s;econd my efforts, Lovzin&s;ki; the feeble intere&s;ts of love ought to di&s;appear before more &s;acred claims. I cannot pre&s;ent my daughter to you during this awful moment of &s;u&s;pence, when our common country is in danger; but I promi&s;e to you, that the fir&s;t days of peace &s;hall be marked by your union with Lodoi&s;ka.</P>
<P>Pulau&s;ki did not &s;peak in vain. I felt that I had now more e&s;&s;ential duties to fulfil than tho&s;e of love; but the cares with which my mind was
<PB N="16" REF="032388_0015_0FF20D8DF2970108">
occupied, were hardly able to alleviate my grief. I will even avow to you without blu&s;hing, that the &s;orrow of my &s;i&s;ters, their tender friend&s;hip, and the care&s;&s;es more re&s;erved but no le&s;s plea&s;ing of my mi&s;tre&s;s, made a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on my heart than the patriotic coun&s;els of Pulau&s;ki. I beheld Lodoi&s;ka tenderly affected with my irrepa|rable lo&s;s, and as much afflicted as my&s;elf, at the cruel events which forced us to defer our union; my chagrin, by being thus divided with that lovely woman, &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ibly to dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>In the mean time the king dies, and the diet is convoked. On the day that it was to open, at the very in&s;tant when I was about to repair to the a&s;&s;embly, a &s;tranger pre&s;ented him&s;elf, and de&s;ired to &s;peak to me in private. As &s;oon as my attendants were retired, he enters my apartment with pre|cipitation, throws him&s;elf into my arms, and tenderly embraces me. It was M. de P&mdash;! Ten years, which had elap&s;ed &s;ince our &s;eparation, had not &s;o much changed his features as to prevent me from recogni&s;ing him, and te&s;tifying my joy and &s;urpri&s;e at his unexpected return.</P>
<P>You will be more a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;ays he to me, when you know the cau&s;e. I have arrived this in&s;tant, and am about to repair to the meeting of the diet;&mdash;would it be pre&s;uming too much on your friend&s;hip to reckon on your vote?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="032388_0016_0FF20D918959E7D8">On my vote! and for whom?</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, continues he with vivacity; it is not now time to recount to you the happy revolution that has taken place in my fortune, and which at pre&s;ent permits me to entertain &s;uch exalted hopes: it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that my ambition is at lea&s;t ju&s;tified by a majority of &s;uffrages, and that it is in vain that two feeble rivals would attempt to di&s;pute with me the crown to which I pretend.</P>
<P>Lovzin&s;ki, adds he, embracing me again, if you were not my friend, and if I e&s;teemed you le&s;s, perhaps I &s;hould endeavour to dazzle you by means of promi&s;es; perhaps I &s;hould recount to you the favours which I intend to heap upon you; the honourable di&s;tinctions that are re&s;erved for you, and the noble and glorious career that is about to offer it&s;elf to your ambition;&mdash;but I have not any need of &s;educing, and I only wi&s;h to per&s;uade you.</P>
<P>I behold it with grief, and you know it as well as my&s;elf, that for &s;everal years pa&s;t our Poland, become enfeebled, owes its &s;afety to nothing el&s;e than the di&s;tru&s;t of the three great powers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;&s;ia, Pru&s;&s;ia, and the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</NOTE> which &s;urround it, and the de&s;ire to enrich them|&s;elves with our &s;poils may in one moment reunite our divided enemies!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032388_0017_0FF20D952A1FEB98">Let us prevent, if we can, this inau&s;picious triumvirate from di&s;membering the republic. Undoubtedly, in more fortunate times, our ance&s;tors were able to maintain the freedom of their elections; it is nece&s;&s;ary however that we &s;hould yield to that nece&s;&s;ity which is become inevitable.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ia will nece&s;&s;arily protect a king, whom &s;he her&s;elf has elevated; in receiving the &s;overeign of her choice, you will defeat the views of that triple alliance which will render our perdition certain, and we &s;hall acquire a powerful ally, who will oppo&s;e her&s;elf with &s;ucce&s;s to the two enemies that remain to us.</P>
<P>The&s;e are rea&s;ons which have determined my conduct; I do not abandon part of our rights, but to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t precious of them.

<P>We repaired to the diet together; I voted for M. de P&mdash;. He in effect obtained the ma|jority of the &s;uffrages; but Pulau&s;ki, Zaremba, and &s;ome others, declared them&s;elves in favour of prince C&mdash;. Nothing was decided amid&s;t the tumult of this fir&s;t meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="032388_0018_0FF20D96DE2AB7A0">When the a&s;&s;embly broke up, M. de P&mdash; invited me to accompany him to the palace, which his &s;ecret emi&s;&s;aries had already prepared for him in the capital.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The diet for the election of the kings of Poland was held half a league from War&s;aw, in the open air, on the other &s;ide of the Vi&s;tula, near to the village of Vola.</NOTE> We &s;hut our&s;elves up together during &s;everal hours, and renewed the promi&s;es of a friend&s;hip that &s;hould endure for ever.

<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e ideas, I flew towards my future father-in-law, burning with the de&s;ire of adding him to the party of my friend. Pulau&s;ki was walking at a great pace up and down the chamber of his daughter, who appeared equally agitated with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Behold, &s;aid he to Lodoi&s;ka, the moment that he &s;aw me enter, behold that man whom I e&s;teem, and whom you love! He has &s;acrificed us both to his blind friend&s;hip. I was de&s;irous to reply, but

<P>I be&s;ought him to hear me, and be con&s;trained him&s;elf &s;o far as to pre&s;erve a &s;tern &s;ilence: I then informed him, that M. de P&mdash;, whom I had for a long time neglected, had agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed me by his unexpected return.</P>

<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians, &s;ay I with fury; the Ru&s;&s;ians reign

in my country! On this Pulau&s;ki, advancing towards me with the greate&s;t impetuo&s;ity, cries out: Perfidious youth! you have deceived me, and you would betray the &s;tate! Leave my hou&s;e this very moment, or know that I &s;hall order you to be dragged out of it!</P>
<P>I frankly ackowledge to you, Faublas, that an affront &s;o cruel, and &s;o little merited, di&s;armed me of my prudence: in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of my fury, I placed my hand upon my &s;word; and quicker than lightning Pulau&s;ki brandi&s;hed his in the air.</P>
<P>His daughter, his di&s;tracted daughter, ru&s;hed forward, and precipitated her&s;elf upon me, crying out, Lovzin&s;ki, what are you about to do? On hearing the accents of a voice &s;o dear to me, I recalled my wandering rea&s;on; but I perceived that a &s;ingle in&s;tant was about forever to bereave me of my Lodoi&s;ka! She had left me to throw her&s;elf into the arms of her father. He, cruel man, beheld my grief, and &s;trove to augment it: Go, traitor! &s;ays he&mdash;begone&mdash;you behold Lodoi&s;ka for the la&s;t time!</P>
<P>I returned home in a &s;tate of de&s;peration. The odious names which Pulau&s;ki had lavi&s;hed on me, returned uncea&s;ingly to my reflection. The in|tere&s;ts of Poland, and tho&s;e of M. de P&mdash;, appeared to be &s;o intimately connected together,

that I did not perceive in what manner I could betray my fellow-citizens by &s;erving my friend; in the mean time, I was obliged either to abandon him or renounce Lodoi&s;ka forever. What was I to re&s;olve? what part &s;hould I take? I pa&s;&s;ed the whole night in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t cruel uncer|tainty; and when the day appeared, I went towards Pulau&s;ki's hou&s;e, without yet having come to any determination.</P>
<P>The only dome&s;tic who remained there informed me, that his lord had departed at the beginning of the night, with his daughter, after having fir&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all his people. Think of my de&s;pair on hearing the&s;e news. I a&s;ked to what part Pulau&s;ki had retired, but my que&s;tion was in vain, for he informed me that he was entirely ignorant of the place of his de&s;tination.</P>
<P>All that I can tell you, &s;ays he, is, that you had &s;carce gone away ye&s;terday evening, when we heard a great noi&s;e in the apartment of his daughter&punc; Still terrified at the &s;cene which had taken place between you, I approached the door, and li&s;tened. Lodoi&s;ka wept: her furious father overwhelmed her with injuries, be&s;towed his malediction upon her, and I my&s;elf heard him exclaim: To love a traitor is to be one! Ungrateful wretch! I &s;hall conduct you to a place of &s;afety, where you &s;hall henceforth be at a di&s;tance from &s;eduction.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="032388_0022_0FF20DA6A09C9260">Could I any longer doubt the extent of my mi&s;ery? I in&s;tantly called for Bole&s;las, one of the mo&s;t faithful of my dome&s;tics: I ordered him to place tru&s;ty &s;pies about the palace of Pulau&s;ki, who &s;hould bring an account of every thing that pa&s;&s;ed there; and commanded that if the count returned to the capital before me, he &s;hould follow him wherever he went. Having given the&s;e in&s;tructions, and not yet de&s;pairing of &s;till finding the family at one of their &s;eats in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, I my&s;elf &s;et out in pur&s;uit of my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I accordingly &s;earched through all the domains of Pulau&s;ki, and a&s;ked concerning Lodoi&s;ka, of all the pa&s;&s;engers whom I met, but without &s;ucce&s;s. After having &s;pent eight days in fruitle&s;s enquiry, I re&s;olved to return to War&s;aw, and I was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed, on my arrival, to find a Ruffian army encamped on the banks of the Vi&s;tula, almo&s;t under the very walls of that city.</P>
<P>It was night when I entered the capital: the palaces of the grandees were all illuminated; an immen&s;e multitude filled the &s;treets; I heard &s;ongs of joy: I beheld wine flowing in rivulets in the public &s;quares; every thing announced to me that Poland had a king.</P>
<P>Bole&s;las, who expected me with impatience, informed me that Pulau&s;ki had returned alone on

the &s;econd day after my departure; and that he had not &s;tirred from his own palace but to repair to the diet, where in &s;pite of his efforts, the a&s;cendancy of Ruffia became every day more manife&s;t. During the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly held this very morning, adds he, M. de P&mdash; united almo&s;t all the &s;uffrages in his favour, and was about to be declared king, when Pulau&s;ki pro|nounced the fatal <HI>vote:</HI> at that in&s;tant twenty &s;abres were brandi&s;hed in the air. The fierce palatine of &mdash;, whom the count had in&s;ulted in the former a&s;&s;embly, was the fir&s;t to ru&s;h forwarde, and gave him a terrible wound on the head. Zaremba, and &s;ome others, flew to the defence of their friend; but all their efforts would have been unable to have &s;aved him, if M. de P&mdash;, had not ranged him&s;elf on their &s;ide, exclaiming at the &s;ame time, that he would &s;acrifice, with his own hand, the fir&s;t per&s;on who dared to approach him. On this the a&s;&s;ailants retired. In the mean time Pulau&s;ki, fainting with the lo&s;s of blood, was carried off the field in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. Zaremba departed al&s;o, &s;wearing to avenge his friend. Having thus become ma&s;ter of the deliberations, the numerous parti&s;ans of M. de P&mdash; in&s;tantly proclaimed him &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Pulau&s;ki, who had been carried to his palace,
<PB N="25" REF="032388_0024_0FF20DADB441F9B8">
was &s;oon re&s;tored to life; and the &s;urgeon who attended him, declared that his wounds, although dangerous, were not mortal. In that &s;tate, although langui&s;hing under the mo&s;t cruel torments, con|trary to the advice of all his friends, he ordered him&s;elf to be lifted into a carriage, and before noon he left War&s;aw, accompanied by Mazeppa and a few mal-contents.</P>
<P>It was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to have announced wor&s;e news to me. My friend was upon the throne, but my reconciliation with Pulauski appeared henceforth impo&s;&s;ible, and in all appearance Lo|doiska was lo&s;t for ever. I knew her father &s;o well as to be under apprehen&s;ions left he &s;hould proceed to extremities with his daughter. I was affrighted at the pre&s;ent, I dur&s;t not look forward towards the future; and my heart was &s;o devoured with chagrin, that I did not go out, even to felici|tate the new king.</P>
<P>One of my people Bole&s;las di&s;patched after Pulau&s;ki, returned at the end of the fourth day: he had followed him fifteen leagues from the capital; when about that di&s;tance, Zaremba, who perceived a &s;tranger at a little di&s;tance from the carriage, began to conceive &s;u&s;picions. As they proceeded, four of his followers, who had concealed them|&s;elves behind the ruins of an old hou&s;e, &s;urpri&s;ed my courier, and conducted him to Pulau&s;ki.
<PB N="26" REF="032388_0025_0FF20DB140119FB8">
He, with a pi&s;tol in his hand, forced him to acknowledge to whom he belonged. I &s;hall &s;end you back to Lovzin&s;ki, &s;aid the fierce republican, on purpo&s;e to announce from me, that he &s;hall not e&s;cape my ju&s;t vengeance. At the&s;e words they blind-folded my &s;ervant, who could not tell where they had carried him. At the end of four and twenty hours they returned, and tying a handkerchief once more about his eyes, they put him into a carriage, which having &s;topped at length after a journey of &s;everal hours, he was ordered to de&s;cend. Scarce had he put his foot upon the ground but his guards departed at a full gallop; on which he removed the bandage, and found him&s;elf on the &s;ame &s;pot as that on which he had been fir&s;t arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>This intelligence filled me with unea&s;ine&s;s: the menaces of Pulau&s;ki terrified me much le&s;s on my own account than on Lodoi&s;ka's, who remained in his own power: in the mid&s;t of his fury he might &s;acrifice her life! I re&s;olved, therefore, to expo&s;e my&s;elf to every &s;pecies of danger, on purpo&s;e to di&s;cover the retreat of the father, and the pri&s;on of his only child.</P>
<P>On the &s;ucceeding day, after informing my &s;i&s;ters of my de&s;ign, I left the capital: Bole&s;las alone accompanied me, and I pa&s;&s;ed for his brother. We wandered over all Poland, and I
<PB N="27" REF="032388_0026_0FF20DB2EFA95AE0">
then perceived, that the fears of Pulau&s;ki were but too well ju&s;tified by the event. Under pretence of obliging the inhabitants to take the oath of fidelity to the new king, the Ru&s;&s;ians, &s;cattered about in the provinces, de&s;olated the country, and committed a multitude of exactions in the cities.</P>
<P>After having &s;pent three months in vain enqui|ries, de&s;pairing of being able to find Lodoiska, touched with the mo&s;t lively grief for the fate of my country, and weeping at one and the &s;ame time for her misfortunes and my own, I was about to return to War&s;aw, to inform the new king of the exce&s;&s;es committed by tho&s;e foreigners in his &s;tates, when an adventure that at fir&s;t &s;eemed to be very inau&s;picious, forced me to a very different re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The Turks having declared war again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia, the Tartars of Budziac and the Crimea made fre|quent incur&s;ions into Volhynia, where I then was. Four of tho&s;e robbers attacked us one afternoon, as we were leaving a wood near O&s;tropol. I had imprudently neglected to load my pi&s;tols; but I made u&s;e of my &s;abre with &s;o much addre&s;s and good luck, that in a &s;hort time two of them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> covered with wounds. Bole&s;las encountered the third; the fourth attacked me with great fury; he gave me a &s;light cut upon the leg, but received a terrible &s;troke in return that di&s;mounted him
<PB N="28" REF="032388_0027_0FF20DB4C29EFD70">
from his hor&s;e, and felled him to the ground. Bole&s;las, at the &s;ame moment, perceived him&s;elf di&s;encumbered from his enemy, who, at the noi&s;e made by his comrade's fall, took to flight. He, whom I had ju&s;t vanqui&s;hed, then addre&s;&s;ed me in very bad Poli&s;h, and &s;aid: "A brave man like you, ought to be generous. I beg my life of you; in&s;tead of putting me to death, &s;uccour me, relieve me, bind up my wounds, and a&s;&s;i&s;t me to ari&s;e."</P>
<P>He demanded quarter with an air &s;o noble, that I did not he&s;itate for a moment. I accordingly de&s;cended from my hor&s;e, and Bole&s;las and my&s;elf having helped him to ari&s;e, we dre&s;&s;ed his wounds. "You behave well," &s;ays the Tartar to me: "you behave well!" As he &s;poke, we beheld a cloud of du&s;t, and in a moment after, more than three hundred Tartars ru&s;hed upon us at full &s;peed. "Be not afraid, dread nothing," &s;ays he, whom I had &s;pared; "I am chief of this troop." Accordingly, by means of a &s;ign, he &s;tops his followers, who were on the point of ma&s;&s;acreing us; and &s;peaking to them in their own language, which I was unable to comprehend; they in&s;tantly opened their ranks on purpo&s;e to permit us to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Brave man, exclaims their captain, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me once more, had I not rea&s;on to &s;ay, that you behaved well? You left me my life, and I now &s;ave your's: it is &s;ometimes right to
<PB N="29" REF="032388_0028_0FF20DBC0233FAE8">
&s;pare an enemy, and even a robber! Hear me, my friend: in attacking you, I followed my profe&s;&s;ion, and you did your duty in conquering me; let us therefore embrace.&mdash;He then adds: the day is wa&s;ting, and I would not advi&s;e you to travel in the&s;e cantons during the pre&s;ent night. My people are about to repair each to his re&s;pective po&s;t, and I cannot an&s;wer for their di&s;cretion. You per|ceive a ca&s;tle on a ri&s;ing ground, towards the right: it belongs to a certain Pole of the name of Dourlinski, for whom we have a right e&s;teem, becau&s;e he is very rich: Go, demand an a&s;ylum from him; tell him that you have wounded Tit&s;i|kan, and that Tit&s;ikan pur&s;ues you. He is ac|quainted with my name: I have already made him pa&s;s many an unea&s;y night. As to the re&s;t, you may rely on it, that while you remain with him, his ca&s;tle &s;hall be &s;acred; but be careful not to come forth on any account before the end of three days, and not to remain there longer than eight.&mdash;Adieu!</P>
<P>It was with unfeigned plea&s;ure that we took leave of Tit&s;ikan and his companions. The advice of the Tartar was a command; I therefore &s;aid to Bole&s;las, let us immediately make for the ca&s;tle that he has now pointed out to us; I am well acquainted with this &s;ame Dourlinski by name. Pulauski has &s;ometimes &s;poken to me concerning
<PB N="30" REF="032388_0029_0FF20DBF75A016A0">
him; he perhaps is not ignorant of the place to which the count has retired, and it is not im|po&s;&s;ible but that with a little addre&s;s we may be able to draw the &s;ecret from him. I &s;hall &s;ay at all events that we are &s;ent by Pulauski, and this recommendation will be of more &s;ervice to us than that of Tit&s;ikan: in the mean time, Bole&s;las, do not forget that I am your brother, and be &s;ure not to di&s;cover me.</P>
<P>We &s;oon arrived at the ditch of the ca&s;tle; the &s;ervants of Dourlinski demanded who we were: I an&s;wered that we were come from Pulauski, and wi&s;hed to &s;peak to their lord, and that we had been attacked by robbers, who were &s;till in pur&s;uit of us. The drawbridge was accordingly let down; and having entered, we were informed that at pre&s;ent we could not &s;ee Dourlinski, but that on the next day at ten o'clock he &s;hould give us audience. They then demanded our arms, which we delivered up without any difficulty, and Bole&s;las &s;oon after took an opportunity of looking at my wound, which was found to be but &s;uperficial.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time a frugal repa&s;t was &s;erved up for us, in the kitchen. We were afterwards conducted to a lower chamber, where two bad beds were prepared for us. The dome&s;tics then left us without any light, and immediately locked the door of the apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032388_0030_0FF20DC12AA38ED0">I could not clo&s;e my eyes during the whole night. Tit&s;ikan had given me but a &s;light wound, but that which my heart had received was &s;o very deep! At day break, I became impatient in my pri&s;on, and wi&s;hed to open the &s;hutters, but they were nailed up. I attacked them, however, &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that the fa&s;tening gave way; and I beheld a very fine park. The window being low, I cleared it at a leap, and in a &s;ingle in&s;tant found my&s;elf in the gardens of the Poli&s;h chieftain.</P>
<P>After having walked about for a few minutes, I &s;at down on a &s;tone bench, which was placed at the foot of a tower, who&s;e ancient architecture I had been &s;ome time con&s;idering. I remained for a few &s;econds enveloped in reflection, when a tile fell at my feet. I thought it had dropped from the roof of this old building; and, to avoid the effects of a &s;imilar accident, I went and placed my&s;elf at the other end of the &s;eat. A few moments after, a &s;econd tile fell by my &s;ide. The circum&s;tance appeared &s;urpri&s;ing: I aro&s;e with &s;ome degree of inquietude, and attentively exam|ined the tower. I perceived at about twenty-five or thirty feet from the ground, a narrow opening. On this I picked up the tiles which had been thrown at me, and on the fir&s;t I di&s;covered the following words, written with a bit of plai&s;ter.</P>
<P>Lovzin&s;ki, is it you! Do you &s;till live!</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="032388_0031_0FF20DC6819D2988">And on the &s;econd the&s;e:</P>
<P>Deliver me! &s;ave Lodoi&s;ka.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible for you, my dear Faublas, to conceive how many different &s;entiments occupied my mind at one and the &s;ame time: my a&s;toni&s;h|ment, my joy, my grief, my embarra&s;&s;ment, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. I examined once more the pri&s;on of Lodoiska, and plotted in my own mind how I could procure her liberty. She at length threw down another tile, and I read as follows:</P>
<P>"At midnight, bring me paper, ink, and pens; and to-morrow, an hour after &s;un-ri&s;e, come and receive a letter.&mdash;Begone."&mdash;</P>
<P>Having returned towards my chamber, I called Bole&s;las, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in re-entering through the window. I then informed my faithful &s;ervant, of the unexpected accident that had put an end to my wanderings, and redoubled my inqui|etude.</P>
<P>How could I penetrate into this tower? How could we procure arms? By what means were we to deliver Lodoiska from captivity? How could we carry her off under the eye of Dourlinski, in the mid&s;t of his people, and from a fortified ca&s;tle! and &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;o many ob&s;tacles were not un&s;urmountable, could I attempt &s;uch a diffi|cult enterprize during the &s;hort delay pre&s;cribed by Tit&s;ikan?</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="032388_0032_0FF20DCA03A63FF8">Did not the Tartar enjoin me to &s;tay with Dourlinski three days, but not to remain longer than eight?</P>
<P>Would it not be to expo&s;e our&s;elves to the attacks of the enemy, to leave this ca&s;tle before the third, or after the expiration of the eighth day? Should I relea&s;e my dear Lodoiska from a pri&s;on, on purpo&s;e to deliver her into the hands of robbers, to be forever &s;eparated from her by &s;lavery or by death? This would be a horrible idea!</P>
<P>But wherefore was &s;he confined in &s;uch a frightful pri&s;on? The letter which &s;he had promi&s;ed would doubtle&s;s in&s;truct me: it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to procure paper, pen and ink.

<P>It was broad daylight when they came to &s;et us at liberty, and inform us, that Dourlinski was at lei&s;ure, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee us.&mdash;We accordingly pre&s;ented our&s;elves before him with great confi|dence; and we were introduced to a man of about &s;ixty years of age, who&s;e reception was blunt, and who&s;e manners were repu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">e.

<P>He is well made, and about my height.</P>
<P>His per&s;on?&mdash;is prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; it is&mdash;</P>
<P>He is a wretch, adds he, interrupting me in a great pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;O that he were but to fall into my hands!</P>
<P>My lord, they &s;ay that he is brave&mdash;</P>
<P>He! I will wager any &s;um of money that he is only calculated to &s;educe women!&mdash;O that he would but fall into my hands! Then a&s;&s;uming a le&s;s ferocious tone, he continued thus: It is a long time &s;ince Pulauski wrote to me&mdash;where is he at pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>My lord, I have preci&s;e orders not to an&s;wer that que&s;tion: all that I dare to &s;ay is, that he has the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons for neither di&s;covering the place of his retreat, nor writing to any per&s;on, and that he will &s;oon come and explain them to you in per&s;on.</P>
<P>Dourlinski appeared exceedingly a&s;toni&s;hed at this information: I even thought that I could di&s;cover &s;ome &s;ymptoms of fear in his counte|nance. At length, looking at his confident, who
<PB N="36" REF="032388_0035_0FF20DD49B073080">
&s;eemed equally embarra&s;&s;ed with him&s;elf, he proceeded. You &s;ay that Pulauski will come here &s;oon? Yes, my lord, in about a fortnight, or a little later. On this he again turned to his attendant; but in a &s;hort time affecting as much calmne&s;s as he had before di&s;covered embarra&s;&s;|ment:&mdash;Return to your ma&s;ter, added he; I am &s;orry to have nothing but bad news to communicate to him&mdash;tell him that Lodoiska is no longer here. I my&s;elf became &s;urpri&s;ed in my turn at this infor|mation. What! my lord, Lodoiska&mdash;</P>
<P>Is not longer here, I tell you!&mdash;to oblige Pulauski, whom I e&s;teem, I undertook, although with great repugnance, the task of confining his daughter in my ca&s;tle: nobody but my&s;elf and he (pointing to his confident) knew that &s;he was here. It is about a month &s;ince we went, as u&s;ual, to carry her provi&s;ions for the day, but there was nobody to be found in the apartment. I am ignorant how it happened; but what I know well is, that &s;he has e&s;caped, for I have heard nothing of her &s;ince.&mdash;She mu&s;t undoubtedly have gone to join Lovzinski at War&s;aw, if perchance the Tartars have not intercepted her in her journey.</P>
<P>My a&s;toni&s;hment on this became extreme. How could I reconcile that which I had &s;een in the garden, with that which Dourlinski now told me? There was &s;ome my&s;tery in this bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="37" REF="032388_0036_0FF20DD832409BD8">
which I became exceedingly impatient to be acquainted with: I was however extremely careful not to exhibit any appearance of doubt. My lord, &s;aid I, this is bad news for my ma&s;ter!&mdash;Undoubt|edly, but it is not my fault.</P>
<P>My lord, I have a favour to ask of you.</P>
<P>Let me hear it.&mdash;The Tartars are ravaging the neighbourhood of your ca&s;tle&mdash;they attacked us&mdash;we e&s;caped, as it were, by a miracle. Will you permit my brother and my&s;elf to remain here only for the &s;pace of two days?</P>
<P>For two days only I give my con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Where do they lodge? &s;ays he to his attendant. In an apartment below ground, was the reply.</P>
<P>Which overlooks my gardens? rejoins Dour|linski, interrupting him with great agitation.</P>
<P>The &s;hutters are well fa&s;tened, adds the other.</P>
<P>No matter&mdash;You mu&s;t put them el&s;ewhere. The&s;e words made me tremble.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible, but&mdash;continues the confi|dent, and then whi&s;pered the re&s;t of the &s;entence in his ear.</P>
<P>Right, &s;ays the baron; and let it be done in&s;tantly. Then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, he &s;ays, your brother and you mu&s;t depart the day after to-morrow; before you go you &s;hall &s;ee me again, and I will give you a letter for Pulauski.</P>
<P>I then went to rejoin Bole&s;las in the kitchen,
<PB N="38" REF="032388_0037_0FF20DDBB38EF598">
where he was at breakfa&s;t, who &s;oon after pre|&s;ented me with a little bottle full of ink, &s;everal pens, and &s;ome &s;heets of paper, which he had procured without difficulty. I panted with de&s;ire to write to Lodoiska; and the only difficulty that now remained, was to find a commodious place, where I might not be di&s;covered by the curio&s;ity of Dourlinski's people.</P>
<P>They had already informed Bole&s;las that we could not again be admitted into the apartment where we had &s;pent the preceding night, until the time &s;hould arrive when we were to retire to re&s;t. I &s;oon, however, bethought my&s;elf of a &s;tratagem which &s;ucceeded to admiration.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants were drinking with my pretended brother, and politely invited me to help them to empty a few flasks.</P>
<P>I &s;wallowed, with a good grace, &s;everal gla&s;&s;es of bad wine in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: in a few minutes my legs &s;eemed to totter under me; my tongue faultered: I related a hundred plea&s;ant and improbable tales to the joyous company; in a word, I acted the <HI>drunken man</HI> &s;o well, that Bole&s;las him&s;elf became a dupe to my &s;cheme, and actually trembled le&s;t, in a moment when I &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to commu|nicate every thing, my &s;ecret &s;hould e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;aid he, to the a&s;toni&s;hed bacchanals, my brother's head is not very &s;trong to-day; it is
<PB N="39" REF="032388_0038_0FF20DDD75522198">
perhaps in con&s;equence of his wound; let us not therefore, either &s;peak to or drink any more with him; for I am afraid of his health, and indeed you would oblige me exceedingly if you would a&s;&s;i&s;t me to carry him to his bed.&mdash;To his own bed? &s;ays one of them, that is impo&s;&s;ible! But I will mo&s;t willingly lend him my chamber. They accordingly laid hold of me, and conveyed me into a garret, of which a bed, a table, and a chair formed the &s;ole movables. Having &s;hut me up in this paltry apartment, they in&s;tantly left me. This was all that I wanted, for the moment that I was alone, I immediately &s;at down to write a long letter to Lodoiska.</P>
<P>I began, by fully ju&s;tifying my&s;elf from the crimes of which I had been accu&s;ed by Pulauski: I then recounted every thing that had occured &s;ince the fir&s;t moment of our &s;eparation, until that when I had entered the ca&s;tle of Dourlinski: I detailed the particulars of my conver&s;ation with the baron: I concluded, by a&s;&s;uring her of the mo&s;t tender and the mo&s;t re&s;pectful pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;wore to her, that the moment &s;he gave me the nece&s;&s;ary information concerning her &s;ituation, I would expo&s;e my&s;elf to every danger in order to fini&s;h her horrid captivity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my letter was &s;ealed, I delivered my&s;elf up to a variety of reflections, which threw
<PB N="40" REF="032388_0039_0FF20DE2CADBFBC8">
me into a &s;trange perplexity. Was it actually Lodoiska who had thrown tho&s;e tiles into the garden? Would Pulauski have had the inju&s;tice to puni&s;h his daughter for an attachment which he him&s;elf had approved? Would he have had the inhumanity to plunge her into a frightful pri&s;on? And even if the hatred he had &s;worn to me, had blinded him &s;o much, how was it po&s;&s;ible, that Dourlinski would thus have conde&s;cended to have become the mini&s;ter of his vengeance?</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, for the&s;e three la&s;t long months, on purpo&s;e to di&s;gui&s;e my&s;elf, I had only worn tattered clothes: the fatigues of a tedious journey, and my chagrin, had altered me greatly; and who but a mi&s;tre&s;s could have been able to di&s;cover Lovzinski in the gardens of Dourlinski? Be&s;ides, had I not &s;een the name of Lodoiska traced upon the tile? Had not Dourlinski him&s;elf acknowledged that Lodoiska had been a pri&s;oner with him? Is it true, he had added that &s;he had made her e&s;cape; but was not this incredible? And wherefore that hatred which Dourlinski had avowed again&s;t me, without knowing my per&s;on? What occa&s;ioned that look of inquietude, when it was told him, that the emi&s;&s;aries of Pulauski occupied a chamber that looked into his garden? And why, above all, that appearance of terror, when I announced to him the approaching arrival of my pretended ma&s;ter?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="032388_0040_0FF20DE4AD6640E0">All the&s;e circum&s;tances were well calculated to throw me into the greate&s;t agitation. I ruminated over this frightful and my&s;terious adventure, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to explain. For two hours, I uncea&s;ingly put new que&s;tions to my&s;elf, to which I was exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed to make any reply; when at length Bole&s;las came to &s;ee if I had recovered from my debauch. I had but little difficulty in convincing him that my inebriety was mere affectation; after which we went down together&punc; to the kitchen, where we &s;pent the re&s;t of the day. What a night!&mdash;My dear Faublas, no one in my whole life ever appeared &s;o long, not even that which followed.</P>
<P>At length the attendants conducted us to our chamber, where they &s;hut us up, as on the former occa&s;ion, without any light: it was yet two tedious hours until midnight. At the fir&s;t &s;troke of the clock, we gently opened the &s;hutters and the ca&s;ement. I then prepared to jump into the gar|den; but my embarra&s;&s;ment was equal to my de&s;pair, when I found my&s;elf ob&s;tructed by means of iron bars. "Behold," &s;aid I to Bole&s;las, "what the cur&s;ed confident of Dourlinski whi&s;pered in his ear! behold what his odious ma&s;ter approved, when he &s;aid, <HI>let it be done in&s;tantly!</HI> behold what they have been working at during the day! it was
<PB N="42" REF="032388_0041_0FF20DEA148B4ED0">
on this account that they prevented us from entering the chamber."</P>
<P>"My lord, they have &s;tood on the out&s;ide," replied Bole&s;las; "for they have not perceived that the &s;hutter has been forced."</P>
<P>"Alas! whether they have perceived <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> or not," exclaimed I, with violence, "what does it &s;ignify? This fatal grating de&s;troys all my hopes; it in&s;ures the &s;lavery of Lodoiska&mdash;it in&s;ures my death."</P>
<P>"Yes, without doubt, it in&s;ures thy death!" repeats a per&s;on at the &s;ame time opening the door; and immediately after, Dourlinski, preceded by &s;everal armed men, and followed by others carrying flambeaux, enters our pri&s;on <HI>&s;abre in hand.</HI> "Traitor!" exclaims he, while addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me with a look in which fury was vi&s;ibly depicted, "I have heard all&mdash;I know who you are, &mdash;your &s;ervant has di&s;covered your name. Trem|ble! Of all the enemies of Lovzinski, I am the mo&s;t implacable!"</P>
<P>"Search them," continued he, turning to his attendants: they accordingly ru&s;hed in upon me; and as I was without arms, I made an u&s;ele&s;s re&s;i&s;tance. They accordingly robbed me of my papers, and of the letter which I had ju&s;t written to Lodoiska. Dourlinski exhibited a thou&s;and &s;igns of impatience while reading it, and was &s;carce able to contain him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="032388_0042_0FF20DEBCC7A61B8">"Lovzinski," &s;ays he to me, endeavouring to &s;mother his rage, "I already de&s;erve all your hatred; I &s;hall &s;oon merit it &s;till more: in the mean time, you mu&s;t remain with your worthy confident in this chamber, to which you are &s;o partial."</P>
<P>After uttering the&s;e words, he left me; and having double locked the door, he placed a centinel on the out&s;ide, and another in the garden, oppo|&s;ite to the window.</P>
<P>Figure to your&s;elf the horrible &s;ituation into which Bole&s;las and my&s;elf were now plunged. My misfortunes were at their height; but tho&s;e of Lodoiska affected me infinitely more than my own! How great mu&s;t be her unea&s;ine&s;s! She expects Lovzinski, and Lovzinski abandons her! But no&mdash;Lodoiska knows me too well; &s;he can never &s;u&s;pect me of &s;uch ba&s;e perfidy. Lodoiska! &s;he will judge of her lover by her&s;elf; &s;he will think that Lovzinski partakes her lot, &s;ince he does not &s;uccour her&mdash;Alas! the very certainty of my misfortunes will augment her own.</P>
<P>On the next day, they gave us provi&s;ions through the grating of our window; and by the quality of the viands which they furni&s;hed us with, Bole&s;las augured the mo&s;t &s;ini&s;ter events. Being however le&s;s unhappy than my&s;elf, he &s;upported
<PB N="44" REF="032388_0043_0FF20DF1220916C8">
his fate much more courageou&s;ly. He offered me my &s;hare of the mean repa&s;t which he was about to make; I could not eat: he pre&s;&s;ed me; but it was in vain! for exi&s;tence was become an un&s;upportable burden to me.</P>
<P>"Ah! live! &s;aid he at length, &s;hedding a torrent of tears: "live; and if not for Bole&s;las, let it be for Lodoiska!" The&s;e words made the mo&s;t lively impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind; they even re-animated my courage: and hope having once more re-entered my heart, I embraced my faithful &s;ervant. "O my friend!" exclaimed I at the &s;ame time with tran&s;port, "my true friend! I have been the occa&s;ion of thy ruin, and yet my misfortunes affect thee more than thine own! Yes, Bole&s;las! yes! I will live for Lodoiska; I will live for thee: if ju&s;t heaven &s;hall re&s;tore me to my fortune and rank, you &s;hall &s;ee that your ma&s;ter is not ungrateful!" We now embraced once more.</P>
<P>Ah! my dear Faublas, how much do misfortunes connect men together! how &s;weet it is, when one &s;uffers, to hear another unfortunate addre&s;s a word of con&s;olation to him!</P>
<P>We had groaned in this pri&s;on for no le&s;s than twelve days, when &s;everal ruffians came to drag me forth on purpo&s;e to conduct me to Dourlinski. Bole&s;las wi&s;hed to follow, but they repul&s;ed him
<PB N="45" REF="032388_0044_0FF20DF2E38379F8">
with violence: however they permitted me to &s;peak to him for a &s;ingle moment. I then drew from a private pocket a ring which I had worn for ten years, and &s;aid to Bole&s;las:&mdash;"This ring was given me by M. de P. when we were at college together at War&s;aw: take it, my friend, and pre&s;erve it for my &s;ake. If Dourlinski this day con&s;ummates his trea&s;on by my a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and if he &s;hould at length permit you to leave this ca&s;tle, go, find your king, recal to his memory our ancient attachment, recount my misfortunes to him; he will recompence you, and &s;uccour Lodoiska. Adieu, my friend!"</P>
<P>After this, I was conducted to the apartment of Dourlinski. As &s;oon as the door opened, I perceived a lady in a chair, who had ju&s;t fainted away. I approached her&mdash;it was Lodoiska! Heavens! how much did I find her altered!&mdash; but &s;he was &s;till hand&s;ome! "Barbarian!" ex|claimed I, addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Dourlinski; and at the voice of her lover, Lodoiska recovered her &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>"Ah, my dear Lovzinski," &s;ays &s;he, looking wi&s;tfully at me, "do you know what this infamous wretch has propo&s;ed? do you know at what price he has offered me your liberty?"</P>
<P>"Yes," cries the furious chieftain, "yes, I am determined upon it: you &s;ee that he is in my
<PB N="46" REF="032388_0045_0FF20DF82B22B1B0">
power; and if in three days I do not obtain my wi&s;hes, he &s;hall be no more!" I endeavoured to throw my&s;elf on my knees at the feet of Lodoiska; but my guards prevented me: "I behold you again, and all my ills are forgotten, Lodoiska&mdash; death has now no longer any thing terrifying in its a&s;pect!"</P>
<P>"Wretch," added I, looking &s;ternly at Dour|linski, "know that Pulauski will avenge his daughter! know that the king will avenge his friend!"</P>
<P>"Let him be carried away," was the only reply made by the ferocious palatine.</P>
<P>"Ah!" exclaims Lodoiska, "my love has been your ruin!" I was about to an&s;wer, but the attendants dragged me out, and re-conducted me to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Bole&s;las received me with inexpre&s;&s;ible tran&s;ports of joy; he avowed to me that he thought me lo&s;t forever, and I recounted to him how my death was but deferred. The &s;cene of which I had ju&s;t been a witne&s;s, confirmed all my &s;u&s;picions; it was evident that Pulauski was ignorant of the unworthy treatment which his daughter expe|rienced; it was al&s;o evident that Dourlinski, old, amorous, and jealous, was determined, at any rate, to &s;atisfy his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the mean time, two of the days allowed
<PB N="47" REF="032388_0046_0FF20DF9E1F93848">
by Dourlin&s;ki for the determination of Lodoiska, had already expired; we were now in the mid&s;t of the night which preceded the fatal third one; I could not &s;leep, and I was walking ha&s;tily about my pri&s;on. All at once I heard the cry of To arms! to arms!" The mo&s;t frightful howlings prevailed on the out&s;ide, and a great commotion took place within the ca&s;tle. Bole&s;las and I were able to di&s;tingui&s;h the voice of Dourlinski, calling and encouraging his followers; and we &s;oon di&s;tinctly heard the cla&s;hing of the &s;words; the cries of the wounded, and the groans of the dying. The noi&s;e which at fir&s;t was very great, &s;eemed at length to die away. It recommenced &s;oon after; it redoubled; and at length we heard the &s;hout of "Victory!"</P>
<P>To this frightful tumult, a &s;till more frightful &s;ilence en&s;ues. In a &s;hort time a low crackling &s;ound is heard to approach us; the air &s;eems to hi&s;s with violence; the night becomes le&s;s dark; the trees in the garden a&s;&s;ume a red and warm tint; we fly to the window; the flames are devouring the ca&s;tle of Dourlinski! They approach the cham|ber in which we were confined, from all &s;ides; and to overwhelm me with new horror, the mo&s;t piercing &s;hrieks are uttered from the tower in which I knew that Lodoiska was impri&s;oned!</P>
<P>The fire becoming every moment more violent,
<PB N="48" REF="032388_0047_0FF20DFF428AE100">
was about to communicate to the chamber in which we were &s;hut up, and the flames already began to curl around the ba&s;e of the tower in which Lodoiska was immured!</P>
<P>Lodoiska uttered the mo&s;t dreadful groans, to which I an&s;wered by cries of fury. Bole&s;las ru&s;hed from one part of the pri&s;on to another like a madman; he &s;ent forth the mo&s;t terrible howlings; he attempted to bur&s;t open the door with his hands and feet. As for my&s;elf, I remained at the window, and &s;hook, amid&s;t my tran&s;ports of fury, tho&s;e ma&s;&s;ive iron bars which I was unable to bend.</P>
<P>All of a &s;udden, the dome&s;tics, who had lately mounted the battlements, de&s;cend with precipita|tion, and open the gates: we heard the voice of Dourlinski him&s;elf begging for quarter. The victors in&s;tantly precipitate them&s;elves amid&s;t the flames; and being at length attracted by our cries, they force open the door of our pri&s;on with their hatchets.</P>
<P>By their dre&s;s and their arms, I knew them to be Tartars: their chief arrives&mdash;it is Tit&s;ikan!</P>
<P>Ah! ah! exclaims he; it is my brave friend!</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly threw my&s;elf on his neck:&mdash;Tit&s;ikan! Lodoiska!&mdash;a lady!&mdash;the faire&s;t of women! &mdash;in that tower!&mdash;about to be burnt alive!</P>
<P>The&s;e were the incoherent expre&s;&s;ions by which I made my feelings known.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="032388_0048_0FF20D4DF882ACC0">The Tartar in&s;tantly gives the word of com|mand to his &s;oldiers: they fly to the tower: I fly along with them: Bole&s;las follows us. They bur&s;t open the doors; and near to an old pillar we di&s;cover a narrow, winding &s;tairca&s;e, filled with &s;moke.</P>
<P>The Tartars, affrighted at the danger, &s;tart back: I prepare to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>Alas! what are you about? exclaims Bole&s;las.</P>
<P>To live or die with Lodoiska!</P>
<P>And I will either live or die with my ma&s;ter! was the reply of my generous &s;ervant.</P>
<P>I ru&s;h on&mdash;he follows me! At the risk of &s;uffocation we a&s;cend about forty &s;teps: by the light of the flames we di&s;cover Lodoiska in a corner of her pri&s;on; who feebly utters: Who is it that approaches me?</P>
<P>It is Lovzinski! it is your lover!</P>
<P>Joy in&s;tantly lends her new &s;trength; &s;he ri&s;es and flies into my arms: we carry her away; we de&s;cend a few &s;teps; but volumes of &s;moke now fill the &s;tairca&s;e, and we are forced to re-a&s;cend with precipitation. At that very in&s;tant too, a part of the tower gives way!&mdash;Bole&s;las utters a dreadful &s;hriek, and Lodoiska falls into a &s;woon.</P>
<P>Faublas, that which was on the point of de&s;troying, &s;aved us! The flames, formerly &s;mo|thered, began to extend with greater rapidity;
<PB N="50" REF="032388_0049_0FF20E02CB109888">
but the &s;moke was di&s;&s;ipated.&mdash;Laden with our precious burden, Bole&s;las and I de&s;cend in ha&s;te. &mdash;My friend, I do not exaggerate; every &s;tep trembled under our feet! the walls were all on fire! At length we arrived at the gate of the tower; Tit&s;ikan, trembling for our &s;afety, was expecting us there: Brave men! exclaimed he, on &s;eeing us appear again.&mdash;I place Lodoiska at his feet, and fall down lifele&s;s by her &s;ide!</P>
<P>I remained nearly an hour in this &s;ituation. They tremble for my life; and Bole&s;las weeps aloud. I again recover my &s;en&s;es, on hearing the voice of Lodoiska, who, returning to her&s;elf, calls me her deliverer. The appearance of every thing was altered; the tower was entirely in ruins. The Tartars, however, had &s;topped the progre&s;s of the flames; they had de&s;troyed one part of the ca&s;tle, on purpo&s;e to &s;ave the re|mainder; in fine, we had been carried into a large &s;aloon, where we were &s;urrounded by Tit&s;ikan and &s;ome of his &s;oldiers. Others of them were occupied in pillaging and in bringing away the gold, &s;ilver, jewels, plate, and all the precious effects which the flames had &s;pared.</P>
<P>Near to us, Dourlinski, loaded with fetters, and uttering repeated groans, beheld this heap of riches, of which he was about to be de&s;poiled. Rage, terror, de&s;pair, all the pa&s;&s;ions which can
<PB N="51" REF="032388_0050_0FF20E064EA5D8F0">
tear the heart of a villain &s;uffering under puni&s;h|ment, were vi&s;ibly depicted in his wild and wandering looks. He &s;truck the earth with fury, da&s;hed his clenched hands again&s;t his forehead, and, uttering the mo&s;t horrible bla&s;phemies, he reproached heaven for its ju&s;t vengeance.</P>
<P>In the mean time, my lovely mi&s;tre&s;s holds my hand cla&s;ped in her's. Alas, &s;ays &s;he, at length, with tears in her eyes, alas! you have &s;aved my life, and your own is &s;till in danger! Nay, even if we e&s;cape death, &s;lavery awaits us!</P>
<P>No, no, Lodoiski, be comforted, Tit&s;ikan is not my enemy; Tit&s;ikan will put a period to our misfortunes&mdash;</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, if I am able, exclaims the Tartar, interrupting me: you are in the right, brave man! (adds he) I &s;ee that you are not dead, and I am happy: you always &s;ay and do good things; and you have there (turning to Bole&s;las), you have there a friend who &s;econds you admirably.</P>
<P>On this I embrace Bole&s;las:&mdash;yes, Tit&s;ikan, yes, I have a friend, who &s;hall always be dear to me!&mdash;</P>
<P>The Tartar again interrupts me: What! were not you both confined in an apartment below ground, and was not this lady in a tower? What was the rea&s;on of this? I will lay any wager, continues he with a &s;mile, that you have taken
<PB N="52" REF="032388_0051_0FF20E081CCEA240">
this female from that old lecher (pointing to Dourlinski) and you are in the right; for he is a dotard, and &s;he is beautiful! Come&mdash;inform me of every thing.</P>
<P>I now di&s;cover my name to Tit&s;ikan, that of Lodoiska's father, and every particular that occur|red to me until that moment. It belongs to Lodoiska, I ob&s;erve in conclu&s;ion, to make us acquainted with what &s;he has been obliged to &s;uffer from the infamous Dourlinski, ever &s;ince &s;he has been in his ca&s;tle!</P>
<P>You know, replies Lodoiska, that my father obliged me to leave War&s;aw, on the day that the diet was opened. He fir&s;t conducted me to the territories of the palatine of &mdash;, at only twenty leagues di&s;tance from the capital, to which he returned, on purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the meeting of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>On that very day, when M. de P&mdash; was proclaimed king, Pulauski took me from the ca&s;tle of the palatine, and conducted me here, thinking that I &s;hould be better concealed. He charged Dourlinski to guard me with extraordinary &s;trictne&s;s; and, above all things, to take e&s;pecial care to prevent Lovzinski from di&s;covering the place of my retreat. He then left me, as he informed me, on purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;emble and to encourage the good citizens to defend his country,
<PB N="53" REF="032388_0052_0FF20E0D85A32938">
and to puni&s;h traitors. Alas! the&s;e important avocations have made him forget his daughter, for I have never &s;een him &s;ince.</P>
<P>A few days after his departure, I began to perceive, that the vi&s;its of Dourlinski had been more frequent than u&s;ual; in a &s;hort time, he hardly ever quitted the apartment which had been a&s;&s;igned me for a pri&s;on. He deprived me, under &s;ome trifling pretexts, of the only female attendant, whom my father had left me; and to prevent any per&s;on (as he &s;aid) from knowing that I was in his ca&s;tle, he him&s;elf brought me the food nece&s;&s;ary for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and pa&s;&s;ed whole days along with me.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive, my dear Lovzinski, how much I &s;uffered from die continual pre&s;ence of a man who was odious to me, and who&s;e infamous de&s;igns I was &s;u&s;picious of; he even dared to explain him&s;elf to me one day; but I a&s;&s;ured him, that my hate &s;hould always be the price of his tenderne&s;s, and that his unworthy conduct had drawn upon him my &s;overeign contempt.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered me coldly, that in time I would accu&s;tom my&s;elf to &s;ee him, and to &s;uffer his a&s;&s;iduities; nay, he did not in the lea&s;t alter his u&s;ual conduct, for he entered my chamber in the morning, and never retired until night. Separated from all I loved, I had not even the feeble con&s;o|lation
<PB N="54" REF="032388_0053_0FF20E0F4543BB88">
of being able to enjoy the &s;weet recollection of pa&s;t happine&s;s. A witne&s;s to my misfortunes, Dourlinski took plea&s;ure in augmenting them.</P>
<P>Pulauski, &s;ays he to me, commands a body of Poli&s;h troops; Lovzinski betraying his country, which he does not love, and a woman concerning whom he is indifferent, &s;erves in the Ru&s;&s;ian army, where he will be cut off during &s;ome bloody engagement: be&s;ides, if he &s;urvives, it is evident that nothing can ever reconcile your father to him.</P>
<P>A few days after, he came on purpo&s;e to announce to me, that Pulauski, during the night, had attacked the Ru&s;&s;ians in their camp; and that, amid&s;t the confu&s;ion that en&s;ued, my lover had fallen by the hand of my father. The cruel pala|tine even made me read a narrative of this event, drawn up with every appearance of truth, in a kind of public gazette, which doubtle&s;s he had procured to be printed expre&s;sly for the purpo&s;e: be&s;ides, on perceiving the barbarous joy which he affected on this occa&s;ion, I thought the news but too true.</P>
<P>Pitile&s;s tyrant, cried I, you enjoy my tears and my de&s;pair; but cea&s;e to per&s;ecute me, or you will &s;oon &s;ee that the daughter of Pulauski is her&s;elf able to avenge her own injuries.</P>
<P>One evening that he had left me &s;ooner than u&s;ual after I retired to bed, I heard my door
<PB N="55" REF="032388_0054_0FF20E148B59C300">
open very &s;oftly. By the light of a lamp which I kept always burning, I beheld my tyrant advan|cing towards my bed. As there was no crime of which I did not believe him to be capable, I had fore&s;een this event; and I had even taken mea&s;ures to render it un&s;ucce&s;sful. I accordingly armed my&s;elf with a long, &s;harp knife, which I had the precaution to conceal beneath my pillow; I overwhelmed the wretch with the reproaches which he &s;o ju&s;tly merited; and I vowed, if he dared to advance, that I would poignard him with my own hand.</P>
<P>He retired, with &s;urpri&s;e and affright vi&s;ibly delineated on his countenance; I am tired, &s;aid he, as he went out, with experiencing nothing but &s;corn; and if I were not afraid of being overheard, you &s;hould &s;oon perceive what a woman's arm could effect again&s;t mine! But I know a way of vanqui&s;hing your pride! By and by you will think your&s;elf but too happy in being able to purcha&s;e your pardon, by the mo&s;t humi|liating &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>He now withdrew. A few moments after, his confident entered with a pi&s;tol in his hand. I mu&s;t, however, do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that he wept while he announced to me the orders of his lord.</P>
<P>Dre&s;s your&s;elf, madam; you mu&s;t in&s;tantly
<PB N="56" REF="032388_0055_0FF20E163B2BB868">
follow me!&mdash;This was all that he was able to &s;ay to me.</P>
<P>He then conducted me to that very tower, where, without you, I &s;hould this morning have peri&s;hed: he &s;hut me up in that horrible pri&s;on: it was there that I had langui&s;hed for more than a month, without fire, without the light of heaven, and almo&s;t without clothes; with bread and water for my food; for my bed a few tru&s;&s;es of &s;traw: this was the deplorable &s;tate to which the only daughter of a grandee of Poland was reduced!</P>
<P>You &s;hudder, brave &s;tranger, and yet believe me, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I do not recount to you any more than a &s;mall part of my &s;ufferings. One thing, however, rendered my mi&s;ery le&s;s in&s;upportable: I no longer beheld my tyrant. While he expected with tranquility that I &s;hould &s;olicit my pardon, I pa&s;&s;ed whole days and nights calling on the name of my father, and in bewailing my lover! * * * * * * * * * O Lovzinski!! with what a&s;toni&s;hment was I &s;eized; with what joy was my &s;oul penetrated, on that day when I once more beheld you in the gardens of Dour|linski!! * * * * * * * * * * * * Tit&s;ikan was li&s;tening to the &s;tory of our misfor|tunes, with which he appeared to be deeply

affected, when one of his centinels approached, and &s;ounded an alarm. He immediately left us in great ha&s;te, on purpo&s;e to run to the draw-bridge. We heard a great tumult, and began already to pre&s;age &s;ome inau&s;picious event.</P>
<P>While we remained plunged in con&s;ternation, &mdash;Lovzinski, Lodoiska, cowardly and perfidious pair! exclaims Dourlinski, unable to contain his joy&mdash;you have hoped to be able to elude my vengeance, and e&s;cape my cha&s;ti&s;ement. Tremble, you are once more about to fall into my hands. At the noi&s;e of my captivity and misfortunes, the neighbouring nobility are undoubtedly a&s;&s;embled, and have now come to &s;uccour me.</P>
<P>&mdash;They can only revenge you, villain!&mdash;cries Bole&s;las, interrupting him in the mid&s;t of his threats, and &s;eizing at the &s;ame time, an iron bar, with which he prepared to knock him down; I, however, in&s;tantly interpo&s;ed, and prevented him from executing this act of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Tit&s;ikan returned in a few minutes: it is only a fal&s;e alarm, &s;aid he to us: it is nothing more than a &s;mall detachment which I di&s;patched ye&s;terday, on purpo&s;e to &s;cour the country&mdash;they had orders to rejoin me here; and they have brought me &s;ome pri&s;oners: every thing is quiet, and the neighbourhood does not appear to be in the lea&s;t commotion.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="032388_0057_0FF20E1F2B249DE0">While Tit&s;ikan yet &s;poke to me, a number of unfortunates, who&s;e luckle&s;s fate had delivered them into the hands of the enemy, were dragged before him. We fir&s;t beheld five, who being unbound, walked by the &s;ide of their conquerors, with a downca&s;t and malancholy a&s;pect. The Tartars told us, that one of their companions had been overcome with great difficulty, and that was the rea&s;on why he was bound hand and foot!</P>
<P>The &s;ixth now appeared: O heavens! it is my father! exclaims Lodoi&s;ka, running at the &s;ame time towards him. I, too, throw my&s;elf at the feet of Pulau&s;ki.</P>
<P>Are you Pulau&s;ki? &s;ays the Tartar chieftain, 'tis well&mdash;the event is lucky! Believe me, my friend, it is not more than a quarter of an hour &s;ince I fir&s;t heard of you. I know however that you are proud and hot-headed, but no matter; I e&s;teem you: you po&s;&s;e&s;s both courage and abilities; your daughter is beautiful, and does not want for under&s;tanding; Lovzinski is brave&mdash;braver than my&s;elf, as I have already experienced. Attend to what I am about to &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>Pulauski, motionle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;carcely heard the &s;ound of the Tartar's voice; and &s;truck, at the &s;ame time, with the &s;trange &s;pectacle that offered it&s;elf to his view, he began to conceive the mo&s;t horrible &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="032388_0058_0FF20E24671B3EE8">He repul&s;ed my care&s;&s;es with the mo&s;t &s;ignifi|cant di&s;gu&s;t: Wretch! exclaims he at length, you have betrayed your country, a woman who loved you, a man who prided him&s;elf in calling you his &s;on-in-law; it was only wanting to fill up the mea&s;ure of your crimes, that you &s;hould league with robbers.</P>
<P>With robbers! cries Tit&s;ikan&mdash;with robbers indeed, if it &s;o plea&s;e you to call us; but you your&s;elf mu&s;t acknowledge that de&s;cription of people to be good for &s;omething; for without me, perhaps, your daughter by to-morrow's &s;un, would no longer have been a maiden. Be not alarmed, &s;ays he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me: but I know that he is proud, and I therefore am not angry.</P>
<P>We had, by this time, placed Pulau&s;ki in a chair; his daughter and my&s;elf bathed his manacles with our tears: but he &s;till continued to frown at, and to overwhelm me with re|proaches.</P>
<P>What, in the name of the devil, would you wi&s;h for? cries the Tartar, once more addre&s;&s;ing his captive: I tell you that Lovzin&s;ki is a brave man, whom I intend to &s;ee married; and as for your Dourlin&s;ki, he is a rogue, whom I am about to order to be hanged.</P>
<P>I repeat to you, once more, that you alone are

But if you promi&s;e me, upon your honour, that you will be &s;incerly reconciled to Lovzinski, and give your daughter to him for a wife, I will re&s;tore you to your liberty.</P>
<P>He who can brave death, replies the haughty Pulauski, can &s;upport &s;lavery. My daughter &s;hall never be the wife of a traitor.</P>
<P>Do you love better, that &s;he &s;hould be a Tartar's mi&s;tre&s;s?&mdash;If you do not promi&s;e to give her, within the &s;pace of eight days, to this brave man, I my&s;elf &s;hall e&s;pou&s;e her this very night!

<P>My life is in your hands; do with it what&s;oever you plea&s;e. If Pulauski falls beneath the &s;word of a Tartar, he will be lamented, and even his enemies will agree, that he merits a more glorious de&s;tiny: but if he were to con&s;ent&mdash;No! no! I rather choo&s;e&mdash;I prefer death!</P>

<P>I now beheld the Tartar's eyes &s;parkle with fury, and therefore recalled to his memory the promi&s;e he had made me, that he would not give way to his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly! but this man wearies out the patience of a favourite of our prophet! I am but a robber!&mdash;Yet, Pulau&s;ki, I repeat it to you again, that it is my command that Lovzin&s;ki e&s;pou&s;e your daughter.

<P>But for him!</P>

<P>Was my daughter in that tower?</P>
<P>Yes, that hoary villain had confined her there &mdash;that hoary villain, who attempted to violate her!&mdash;Some of you mu&s;t relate the whole to him; but make ha&s;te, as it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould decide it in&s;tantly: I have bu&s;ine&s;s el&s;e|where,

<P>While Tit&s;ikan ordered the rich booty which he had taken, to be &s;towed in little covered waggons, Lodoi&s;ka informed her father of the crimes of Dourlin&s;ki, and mingled the recital of our affection &s;o artfully with the hi&s;tory of our misfortunes, that nature and gratitude at one and the &s;ame time be&s;ieged the heart of Pulau&s;ki.</P>
<P>Affected in the mo&s;t lively manner with the misfortunes of his daughter, and &s;en&s;ible of the important &s;ervices which I had rendered her: he embraces Lodoi&s;ka, and at length beholding me without re&s;entment, he &s;eemed to wait impatiently for an opportunity to be reconciled to me.</P>

<P>The misfortunes which my youth did not fore&s;ee, thy experience had anticipated: but becau&s;e I have been wanting in prudence, ought you to accu&s;e me of perfidy?

<P>Pulau&s;ki here interrupts me:&mdash;It is not there that you ought to repair: you tell me that M. de P&mdash; is not informed of the wrongs done to his native country, and I believe you; but whether he is acquainted with, or whether he is entirely ignorant of them, is now but of little con&s;equence.

<P>No! no! rejoins the Tartar, it is a mere reflection only&mdash;it is one of tho&s;e ideas which a robber cannot prevent.&mdash;My brave and unfortunate friends, I demand nothing from you&mdash;nay, more, you &s;hall not retire on foot; I have &s;ome charming hor&s;es, with which I intend to pre&s;ent you.

<P>Unworthy friend, &s;ays Pulau&s;ki to him, how could you &s;o cruelly abu&s;e the confidence I repo&s;ed in you? Were you not afraid to expo&s;e your&s;elf to my re&s;entment? What demon blinded you?</P>
<P>Love, replies Dourlin&s;ki, an outrageous love! You, perhaps, do not comprehend to what exce&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions may hurry on a man, violent and jealous by nature.

<P>Pulau&s;ki, I have, indeed, merited your hatred; but I am &s;till worthy of your pity. I have ren|dered my&s;elf exceedingly culpable; but you behold me cruelly puni&s;hed. I lo&s;e, in one &s;ingle day, my rank, my riches, my honour, my liberty! more than all this, I lo&s;e thy daughter.</P>
<P>O, Lodoi&s;ka, lovely maiden, whom I have &s;o much outraged, will you deign to forget my per&s;ecutions, your danger, and your grief? Will you deign to grant to me a generous pardon?</P>
<P>Ah, if there are no crimes which a &s;incere repentance cannot expiate, Lodoi&s;ka, I am no longer criminal. I would I were able, at the price of all my blood, to redeem tho&s;e tears which I have occa&s;ioned you to &s;hed. Amid&s;t the

<P>Dourlin&s;ki was not allowed to utter another &s;entence, for the Tartars ru&s;hed in upon him, and threw him into the mid&s;t of the burning ruins. * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>
<P>What a night! my dear Faublas; how many different cares, how many oppo&s;ite &s;entiments agitated my unhappy mind during its continuance! How many times did I experience the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive emotions of fear, hope, grief and joy. After &s;o many dangers and inquietudes, Lodoi&s;ka was at length pre&s;ented to me by her father, and I was intoxicated with the dear hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her: &mdash;a barbarian had but now a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated her in my pre&s;ence!</P>
<P>This was the mo&s;t cruel and unfortunate moment of any during the whole cour&s;e of my life!&mdash;But be comforted, my friend; my happine&s;s,

eclip&s;ed as it were, in a &s;ingle in&s;tant, was not long in &s;hining forth with all its former &s;plendour.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the Tartars belonging to Tit&s;ikan, was one &s;omewhat conver&s;ant in &s;urgery. We &s;end for him; on his arrival he examines the wound, and a&s;&s;ures us, that it is but a &s;light one. The infa|mous Dourlin&s;ki, con&s;trained by his chains, and blinded by his de&s;pair, had happily been prevented from giving any other than an ill-directed blow.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Tit&s;ikan was informed that the life of Lodoi&s;ka was not in any danger, he prepared to take leave of us.</P>
<P>I leave you, &s;aid he, the five dome&s;tics who accompanied Pulau&s;ki; provi&s;ions for &s;everal days, arms, &s;ix excellent hor&s;es, two covered waggons, and all the people belonging to Dourlin&s;ki in chains. Their ba&s;e lord is no more! Adieu! the day is about to appear; do not leave this place until to-morrow; I &s;hall then vi&s;it the other cantons. Adieu, brave Poles! tell to your country|men that Tit&s;ikan is not &s;o bad as he has been repre&s;ented to them, and that he &s;ometimes re&s;tores with one hand what he takes with another. Adieu!</P>
<P>At the&s;e words he lifts his hand to his head, and having &s;aluted us gracefully, after the manner of his country, he gives the &s;ignal to depart: the Tartars, mount their &s;leet cour&s;ers in an

in&s;tant, pa&s;s along the drawbridge, and make for the neighbouring plain at a full gallop.</P>
<P>They had been gone &s;carcely two hours when &s;everal of the neighbouring nobility, &s;upported by a detachment of militia, came on purpo&s;e to inve&s;t the ca&s;tle of Dourlin&s;ki.</P>
<P>Pulau&s;ki him&s;elf went out to receive them: he related the particulars of all that had occurred; and &s;ome, gained over by his eloquence, promi&s;ed to follow us to the palatinate of Lublin.</P>
<P>They a&s;ked for only two days to prepare every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the expedition, and actually came and rejoined us at the appointed time, to the number of &s;ixty.</P>
<P>Lodoi&s;ka having a&s;&s;ured us, that &s;he was now able to undergo the fatigues of a journey, we placed her in a commodious carriage, which we had luckily been able to procure for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After having re&s;tored Dourlin&s;ki's people to liberty, we abandon the two covered waggons to them, in which Tit&s;ikan, acting with his u&s;ual genero&s;ity, had left part of his immen&s;e booty: this we divided among them in equal proportions.</P>
<P>We arrived, without meeting with an accident, at Polowi&s;ki, in the palatinate of Lublin, this being the place which Pulauski had appointed for the general rendezvous.&mdash;The news of his return having gone abroad, a crowd of malecontents in

the &s;pace of le&s;s than a month, &s;tocked <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and increa&s;ed our little army to &s;uch a degree, that we &s;oon found it to amount to no le&s;s than 10,000 men.</P>
<P>Lodoiska, entirely cured of her wound, and perfectly recovered from her fatigues, had regained her u&s;ual &s;pirits, and appeared in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all her former beauty. Pulauski, one day, called me into his tent, and &s;poke as follows: Three thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians have appeared, as you well know, upon the heights above, and at no greater di&s;tance than half a league from us; take, in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing night, three thou&s;and cho&s;en men, and go and cha&s;e the enemy from the advan|tageous po&s;ts which they now occupy. Recollect, that on the &s;ucce&s;s of a fir&s;t attempt, depends almo&s;t always that of the campaign; recollect, that you are about to avenge your country's wrongs; recollect too, my friend, that to-morrow I &s;hall learn thy victory, and, that to-morrow al&s;o, thou &s;halt e&s;pou&s;e Lodoiska?</P>
<P>I began my march about ten o'clock.&mdash;At midnight we &s;urpri&s;ed our enemies in their camp. Never was a defeat more complete: we killed &s;even hundred men; we took nine hundred pri|&s;oners; we &s;eized all their cannon, the military che&s;t, and the ammunition.</P>
<P>At break of day Pulau&s;ki marches out to join

me with the remainder of the troops: he brings Lodoi&s;ka along with him: we are married in Pulau&s;ki's tent. All the camp re&s;ounds with &s;ongs of gladne&s;s: valour and beauty are cele|brated in joyous epithalamiums: it &s;eemed to be the fe&s;tival of Venus and Mars; and it might be truly &s;aid, that every &s;oldier appeared to be impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame &s;entiments as my&s;elf, and that they all partook of my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>After I had given up the fir&s;t days of &s;o dear an union entirely to love, I began to think of recompen&s;ing the heroic fidelity of Bole&s;las. My father-in-law pre&s;ented him with one of his ca&s;tles, &s;ituate at &s;ome leagues from the capital; and Lodoi&s;ki and my&s;elf added to this princely donation a con&s;iderable &s;um in ready money, on purpo&s;e to enable him to lead an independent and tranquil life.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t refu&s;ed to leave us, but we commanded him to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ca&s;tle, and live peaceably in that honourable retreat which his &s;ervices had &s;o amply merited. On the day of his departure I took him a&s;ide:&mdash;You mu&s;t go in my name, &s;aid I, and wait upon our monarch at War&s;aw: inform him that I am united in the bonds of Hymen to the daughter of Pulauski: &s;tate to him that I am armed on purpo&s;e to cha&s;e out of his kingdom tho&s;e foreigners who are

ravaging it; and tell him, in particular, that Louvzinski, a foe to the Ru&s;&s;ians, is not the enemy of his king.</P>
<P>I will not fatigue you, my dear Faublas, with the recital of our operations, during eight &s;ucceeding years of a bloody war.&mdash;Sometimes vanqui&s;hed; much oftener victorious; equally great in the mid&s;t of a defeat, as formidable after a victory, and always &s;uperior to events, Pulauski attracted and fixed the attention of all Europe, whom he a&s;toni&s;hed by his long and vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. Obliged to abandon one province, he made incur&s;ions into, and performed new prodi|gies of valour in another&punc; and it was thus, that in marching &s;ucce&s;&s;ively throughout all the palati|nates, he &s;ignalized in each of them, by &s;ome glo|rious exploit, that eternal hatred which he had &s;worn again&s;t the enemies of Poland.</P>
<P>Wife of a warrior, daughter of a hero, accu&s;|tomed to the tumult of a camp, Lodoiska accom|panied us every where. Of five children which &s;he had borne me, an only daughter alone remained to us, about eighteen months old. One day, after a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate engagement, the victorious Ru&s;&s;ians precipitated them&s;elves towards my tent, on purpo&s;e to plunder it. Pu|lauski and m&s;elf, followed by &s;ome nobles, flew to the defence of Lodoiska, whom we &s;aved
<PB N="74" REF="032388_0073_0FF20E4EB5780CA0">
with difficulty: my daughter, however, had been carried off.</P>
<P>This lovely child, by a &s;age precaution which her mother had wi&s;ely made u&s;e of in tho&s;e times of inte&s;tine commotion, had the arms of our family impre&s;&s;ed, by means a chemical prepa|ration, under her left brea&s;t: but my &s;earch after my daughter has hitherto been ineffectual. Alas, Dorliska, my dear Dorliska, either exi&s;ts in &s;lavery, or exi&s;ts no more!</P>
<P>This lo&s;s affected me with the mo&s;t lively &s;orrow; Pulauski, however, appeared, almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to my misfortunes; either becau&s;e his mind was occupied at this moment with the great project which he &s;oon after communicated to me, or becau&s;e the mi&s;eries of his country alone could effect his &s;toic heart. He, as u&s;ual, re|a&s;&s;embles the remains his army, takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an advantageous po&s;t, employs &s;everal days in fortifying, and maintains him&s;elf in it for three whole months, again&s;t all the efforts of the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>It, however, became at length nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould abandon this &s;ituation, as provi&s;ions were beginning to be &s;carce&mdash;Pulau&s;ki, on this occa&s;ion, came to my tent; and, having ordered every one to retire, when we alone remained, he addre&s;&s;ed me as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="032388_0074_0FF20E5070C51798">Lovzin&s;ki, I have ju&s;t rea&s;on for complaining of your conduct. Formerly you &s;upported, along with me, the burden of command, and I was enabled to divide with my &s;on-in-law a part of my laborious avocations: but for the&s;e two la&s;t months, you do nothing but weep: you &s;igh like a woman. You have abandoned me in a critical moment, when your a&s;&s;i&s;tance was become the mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary. You &s;ee how I am attacked on all &s;ides; I fear not for my&s;elf; I am not unhappy for my own life: but if we peri&s;h, the &s;tate has no longer any defenders.</P>
<P>Awake, Lovzin&s;ki! how nobly you once par|ticipated in my cares. Do not now remain the u&s;ele&s;s witne&s;s of them. We are indeed bathed in Ru&s;&s;ian blood: our fellow-citizens are avenged, but they are not &s;aved: nay, even in a &s;hort time we may be able no longer to defend them.</P>
<P>You a&s;toni&s;h me, Pulau&s;ki! Whence the&s;e &s;ini&s;ter auguries?</P>
<P>I am not alarmed without rea&s;on. Con&s;ider our pre&s;ent po&s;ition: I am forced to awaken in every heart the love of its country; I have found no where but degenerate men, born for &s;lavery, or weak ones, who, although penetrated with a &s;en&s;e of their own misfortunes, have bounded all their views to barren complaints.</P>
<P>Some true citizens are, indeed, ranged under
<PB N="76" REF="032388_0075_0FF20E578685CCC0">
my &s;tandards; but eight long and bloody campaigns have le&s;&s;ened their number, and almo&s;t extin|gui&s;hed them. I become enfeebled by my very victories; our enemies appear more numerous after their defeats.</P>
<P>I repeat to you, Pulau&s;ki, once more, that you a&s;toni&s;h me! In circum&s;tances no le&s;s di&s;a&s;trous, no le&s;s unhappy, than the pre&s;ent, I have beheld you &s;u&s;tain your&s;elf by your courage. . . . .</P>
<P>Do you think that it now abandons me! True valour does not con&s;i&s;t in being blind to danger, but in braving it after it has been fore&s;een. Our enemies prepare for my defeat; however, if you choo&s;e, Lovzinski, the very day which they point out for their triumph, &s;hall perhaps be that de&s;tined to record their ruin, and atchieve the &s;afety of our fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>If I choo&s;e! Can you doubt my &s;entiments? Speak! what would you have done?</P>
<P>To &s;trike the bolde&s;t &s;troke that I ever meditated. Forty cho&s;en men are a&s;&s;embled at Czen&s;tachow along with Kaluvski, who&s;e bravery is well known; they want a chief, able, firm, intrepid&mdash;It is you whom I have cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Pulauski, I am ready.</P>
<P>I will not di&s;&s;emble to you the danger of the enterprize; the event is doubtful, and, if you do not &s;ucceed, your ruin is inevitable.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="032388_0076_0FF20E5AF87D51A8">I tell you that I am ready, therefore explain your&s;elf.</P>
<P>You are not ignorant, that &s;carce four thou&s;and men now fight under my command: with the&s;e undoubtedly I have &s;till an opportunity of tor|menting our enemies; but with &s;uch feeble means, I dare not hope to be ever able to force them to leave our provinces. All the nobility would flock beneath our banners, if the king were in my camp.</P>
<P>What do you &s;ay? Can you hope that the king would ever con&s;ent to repair hither?</P>
<P>No; but he mu&s;t be forced to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Forced!</P>
<P>Yes. I know that an ancient friend&s;hip connects you with M. de P&mdash;: but &s;ince you have &s;up|ported, along with Pulauski, the cau&s;e of liberty, you know al&s;o that you ought to &s;acrifice every thing to the good of your country: that an intere&s;t &s;o &s;acred&mdash;</P>
<P>I know my duty, and I am ready to fulfil it; but what is it that you now propo&s;e to me? the king never leaves War&s;aw.</P>
<P>True; and it is, therefore, at War&s;aw that you mu&s;t go and find him; it is from the heart of the capital that he mu&s;t be forced.</P>
<P>What preparations have you made for &s;o great an enterpri&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="032388_0077_0FF20E5CAD648B60">You behold yon Ru&s;&s;ian army, three times as &s;trong as mine, and which has been encamped three months in &s;ight of us: its general, tranquil at pre&s;ent within his entrenchments, impatiently waits until, forced by famine, I &s;hall &s;urrender my&s;elf at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Behind my camp are mar&s;hes which he thinks impracticable: the moment that it is night, we &s;hall traver&s;e them. I have di&s;po&s;ed of every thing in &s;uch a manner, that the enemy will be deceived, and not perceive my retreat until it is too late. I hope, therefore, to be able to &s;teal more than an hour's march upon them, and, if fortune &s;econds me, perhaps a whole day. I &s;hall advance &s;trait forward to War&s;aw, by the great road that leads to that capital, notwith|&s;tanding the efforts of the little Ru&s;&s;ian bands who hover continually in its neighbourhood. I &s;hall either encounter or conquer the&s;e &s;epa|rately, or, if they form a junction on purpo&s;e to &s;top my progre&s;s, I &s;hall at lea&s;t be able to occupy their attention in &s;uch a manner, that they will not be able to impede your operations.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Lovzin&s;ki, you will have preceded me. Your forty followers di&s;gui&s;ed, and armed only with &s;abres, poignards and pi&s;tols, concealed under their clothes, &s;hall have arrived at War&s;aw by different roads. You mu&s;t wait

<P>M. de P&mdash;will not &s;ee, in my camp, other than citizen &s;oldiers, the foes of foreigners, but &s;till faithful to their king; under my patriotic tents, he will re&s;pire, as it were, the air of liberty, and the love of his country; the enemies of the &s;tate &s;hall become his; our brave nobility, a&s;hamed of their indolence, will readily combat under the royal banners, for the common cau&s;e; the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;hall either be cut in pieces, or be obliged to pa&s;s the frontiers&mdash;my friend, in thee thy country &s;hall behold her &s;aviour. * * *</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="032388_0079_0FF20E5E6B2B2D90">Pulauski held his word. That very night he accompli&s;hed his retreat, with equal &s;kill and &s;ucce&s;s, by traver&s;ing the mar&s;hes in profound &s;ilence. My friend, &s;aid my father-in-law to me, as &s;oon as we were out of the reach of the enemy, it is now time that you &s;hould leave us. I know well that my daughter has more courage than another woman; but &s;he is a tender wife, and an unfortunate mother. Her tears will affect you, and you will lo&s;e in her embraces that &s;trength of mind, that dignity of &s;oul, which now become more nece&s;&s;ary to you than ever: I advi&s;e you, therefore, to be gone, without bidding her farewel.</P>
<P>Pulauski pre&s;&s;ed me, but in vain, for I was unable to con&s;ent. As &s;oon as Lodoiska knew that I &s;hould depart alone, and perceived that we were re&s;olved not to inform her whither, &s;he &s;hed torrents of tears and &s;trove to detain me. I began to he&s;itate.</P>
<P>Lovzinski, cries my father-in-law, at this critical moment, Lovzinski, depart. Wife, children, relations, all ought to be &s;acrificed, when it is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of your country.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly mount my hor&s;e, and make &s;uch ha&s;te, that I arrived by the middle of next day at Czen&s;tachow. I here found forty brave men waiting for me, and determined for the mo&s;t hazardous enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="032388_0080_0FF20D5A44C0C048">Gentlemen, &s;aid I to them, we are now met on purpo&s;e to carry a king out of the mid&s;t of his own capital. Tho&s;e capable of attempting &s;uch a bold enterprize, are alone capable of effecting it: either &s;ucce&s;s or death awaits us.</P>
<P>After this &s;hort harangue, we prepare to depart. Kaluvski, forewarned of our de&s;ign, had already procured twelve waggons, loaded with hay and &s;traw; each of which was drawn by four good hor&s;es.</P>
<P>We in&s;tantly di&s;gui&s;ed our&s;elves as pea&s;ants; we hide our clothes, our &s;abres, our pi&s;tols, and the &s;addles of our hor&s;es, in the hay with which our waggons were partly filled; we agree upon certain &s;igns, and I give them a <HI>watch-word,</HI> to be u&s;ed according to circum&s;tances.&mdash;Twelve of the con&s;pirators, commanded by Kaluvski, enter into War&s;aw, accompanied by as many waggons, which they them&s;elves conduct.

<P>We depart, and on Saturday the 2d of No|vember, 1771, arrive at War&s;aw, and lodge together at a convent belonging to the Dominicans.</P>
<P>On the next day, which was Sunday, and which will for ever form a memorable epoch in the

annals of Poland, one of my people, of the name of Stravinski, being covered with rags, places him&s;elf near the collegiate church, and &s;oon after proceeds, demanding charity even at the gates of the royal palace, where he ob&s;erves every thing that pa&s;&s;ed. Several of the con&s;pirators walked up and down the &s;ix narrow &s;treets in the neigh|bourhood of the great &s;quare where Kaluvski him&s;elf was po&s;ted. We remain in ambu&s;cade during the whole day, and part of the afternoon.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock at night the king leaves the palace; he is followed, and is &s;een to enter the hotel of his uncle, the grand chancellor of Lithuania.</P>
<P>All our followers receive notice of this event, and a&s;&s;emble in&s;tantly; they throw off their mi&s;erable clothes, &s;addle their hor&s;es, and prepare their arms, in the large &s;quare belonging to the convent, where their movements are entirely concealed. They then &s;ally forth, one after the other, under favour of the night. Too well known in War&s;aw to hazard appearing there, without di&s;gui&s;ing my&s;elf, I &s;till wear my pea&s;ant's dre&s;s, and I mount an excellent hor&s;e, capari&s;oned, however, after the common manner.</P>
<P>I then point out to my followers the different po&s;ts in the &s;uburbs, which I had a&s;&s;igned them before our departure from the convent, and they

were di&s;per&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that all the avenues to the palace of the grand chancellor were carefully and &s;trictly guarded.</P>
<P>Between nine and ten o'clock at night, the king comes forth on purpo&s;e to return home; and we remark, with joy, that his attendants were far from being numerous.</P>
<P>The carriage was preceded by two men, who carried <HI>flambeaux,</HI> &s;ome officers of his &s;uite, two gentlemen and an e&s;quire followed. I know not what was the name of the grandee in the coach along with the king. There were two pages, one at each door, two hey-dukes running by the &s;ide of the equipage, and three footmen, in the royal livery, behind.</P>
<P>The king proceeds &s;lowly: part of my people a&s;&s;emble at &s;ome di&s;tance; twelve of the mo&s;t determined &s;pring forward: I put my&s;elf at their head, and we advanced at a good pace.</P>
<P>As there was a Ru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on at that very moment in War&s;aw, we affect to &s;peak the lan|guage of tho&s;e foreigners, &s;o that our petty troop might be mi&s;taken for one of their patroles.</P>
<P>We overtook the carriage at about a hundred and fifty paces from the grand chancellor's palace, and exactly between tho&s;e of the bi&s;hop of Cra|cow and of the late grand general of Poland.</P>
<P>All of a &s;udden we pa&s;s the heads of the

<P>I in&s;tantly give the &s;ignal agreed upon. Kaluvski gallops up, with the remainder of the con&s;pirators: I pre&s;ent a pi&s;tol to the po&s;tillion, who in&s;tantly &s;tops; the coachman is fired upon, and is precipi|tated beneath the wheels. Of the two hey-dukes who endeavoured to defend their prince, one drops, pierced with two balls; the other is over|turned by means of a backhanded &s;troke from a &s;abre, which he receives on the head; the &s;teed belonging to the e&s;quire, falls down covered with wounds: one of the pages is di&s;mounted, and his hor&s;e taken; pi&s;tol balls fly about in all directions &mdash;in &s;hort, the attack was &s;o hot, and the fire &s;o violent, that I trembled for the king's life.</P>
<P>He him&s;elf, however, pre&s;erving the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s in the mid&s;t of the danger, had now de&s;cended from his carriage, and was &s;triving to regain his uncle's palace on foot. Kaluv&s;ki arre&s;ts and &s;eizes him by the hair; &s;even or eight of the con&s;pirators &s;urround, di&s;arm, overpower him, and, pre&s;&s;ing him between their hor&s;es, make off at full gallop, towards the end of the &s;treet.</P>
<P>During this moment, I confe&s;s to you, that I thought Pulauski had ba&s;ely deceived me; that the death of the monarch was re&s;olved upon, and that a plot had been formed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him.</P>

<P>At that moment a panic terror takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my troop: at fifty paces di&s;tant from the ramparts, there were no more than &s;even who &s;urrounded the per&s;on of the king.</P>

to gain the road by which Pulauski had promi&s;ed me to advance, we re&s;olved to pa&s;s through a village called Burakow: but the king exclaims, do not go that way; there are Ru&s;&s;ians there!</P>
<P>I immediately change our <HI>route;</HI> but in propor|tion as we advance through the wood of Beliany, our number continue to dimini&s;h. In a &s;hort time I perceive nobody around me but Kaluvski and Stravinski; a few minutes after we are challenged by a Ru&s;&s;ian centinel on hor&s;eback, at who&s;e voice we in&s;tantly &s;top, greatly alarmed for our &s;afety.</P>
<P>Let us kill him, cries the ferocious Kaluvski, pointing to the king. I in&s;tantly avow to him, without di&s;gui&s;e, the horror which &s;uch a propo|&s;ition in&s;pired me with. Very well, you may then take upon you the task of conducting him, adds this cruel hearted man, who immediately after precipitates him&s;elf into the woods. Stravinski follows him, and I alone remain with the king.</P>
<P>Lovzinski, &s;ays he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, as &s;oon as they were out of &s;ight; it is you, I can no longer doubt it; it is you, for I well remember your voice. I utter not a &s;ingle word in reply. He then mildly adds, it is certainly you, Lovzinski. Who would have thought this ten years ago?</P>
<P>We find our&s;elves at that moment near to the convent of Beliany, di&s;tant no more than a &s;ingle league from War&s;aw.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="032388_0086_0FF20E6E364520A0">Lovzinski, continues the king, permit me to enter this convent, and &s;ave your&s;elf.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t follow me, was my only an&s;wer.</P>
<P>It is in vain, rejoins the monarch, that you are di&s;gui&s;ed; it is in vain that you endeavour to a&s;&s;ume a feigned voice: I know you well; I am fully a&s;&s;ured that you are Lovzinski:&mdash;ah, who would have &s;aid &s;o ten years &s;ince? you would then have lo&s;t your life, on condition of pre&s;erving that of your friend.</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty now cea&s;es to &s;peak; we advance &s;ome time, in a profound &s;ilence, which he again breaking, exclaims, I am overcome with fatigue&mdash; <HI>If you wi&s;h to carry me alive, permit me to repo&s;e my&s;elf for a &s;ingle moment.</HI></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;i&s;t him to de&s;cend from his hor&s;e; he &s;its down upon the gra&s;s, and making me &s;it down by his &s;ide, he takes one of my hands and pre&s;&s;es it between his own:</P>
<P>Lovzinski, you whom I have &s;o much loved, you who know better than any one the purity of my intentions, how comes it about that you have taken up arms again&s;t me. Ungrateful Lovzin&s;ki, &s;hall I never find you but among&s;t my mo&s;t bitter enemies; do you return but on purpo&s;e to &s;acri|fice me.</P>
<P>He then, in the mo&s;t affecting language, recapitulates the plea&s;ures of our early youth; our
<PB N="88" REF="032388_0087_0FF20E73B776CE88">
more intimate connection at an age approaching to manhood, the tender friend&s;hip which we had &s;worn to each other, and the regard which he had ever treated me with &s;ince that period. He &s;poke to me of the honours with which he would have loaded me during his reign, if I had been ambi|tious to merit them: he reproached me more particularly, re&s;pecting the unworthy enterprize of which I appeared to be the leader, but of which, he &s;aid, he was well a&s;&s;ured, that I was no more than the in&s;trument.</P>
<P>He threw all the horror of the plot upon Pulauski, repre&s;enting to me, at the &s;ame time, that the author of &s;uch an attempt was not the &s;ole culpable per&s;on; that I could not charge my&s;elf with its execution, without committing a crime; and that this odious complai&s;ance, &s;o highly trea&s;onable in a &s;ubject, was infinitely more &s;o in a friend. He concluded, by pre&s;&s;ing me to re&s;tore him to his liberty: fly, &s;aid he to me, and be a&s;&s;ured, if I encounter any of the Ru&s;&s;ian patroles, I &s;hall tell them that you have pur&s;ued an oppo&s;ite road from that which you have taken.</P>
<P>The king continued to pre&s;s me with the mo&s;t earne&s;t entreaties: his natural eloquence, aug|mented by the danger of his &s;ituation, carried per&s;ua&s;ion to my heart, and awakened the mo&s;t tender &s;entiments there.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="032388_0088_0FF20D4FAAD9D558">I confe&s;s that I was &s;taggered; I balanced the circum&s;tances for &s;ome time in my own mind, but Pulauski at length triumphed.</P>
<P>I thought that I &s;till heard the fierce republican reproaching me with my pu&s;illanimity. My dear Faublas, the love of one's country has, perhaps its fanatici&s;m and its &s;uper&s;titions: but if I was then culpable, I am &s;till &s;o; I am more than ever pur&s;uaded, that in obliging the king to remount his hor&s;e again, I performed an action that re|flected honour on my patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>Is it thus, &s;ays he to me, in a melancholy accent, that you reject the prayer addre&s;&s;ed to you by a friend! that you refu&s;e the pardon offered to you by your king? Well, then, let us be gone. I deliver my&s;elf up to my unhappy fate, or rather I abandon you to your's.</P>
<P>We now recommence our journey once more; but the entreaties of the monarch, his arguments, his reproaches, his very menaces, the &s;truggles which I felt within my&s;elf, affected me in &s;uch a manner, that I no longer could di&s;cern my way. Wandering up and down the country, I kept no one certain road: after half an hour's fatigue, we found our&s;elves at Marimont,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marimont is a country hou&s;e belonging to the court of Saxony; it is nearer War&s;aw, by half a league than Beliany.</NOTE> and I was
<PB N="90" REF="032388_0089_0FF20E7742BE9F18">
greatly alarmed at &s;eeing us thus return towards War&s;aw, in&s;tead of leaving it at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>At about a quarter of a league beyond this, we unfortunately fell in with a party of Ru&s;&s;ians. The king immediately di&s;covers him&s;elf to the commanding officer, and then in&s;tantly adds: In the cour&s;e of the preceding afternoon, I happened to bewilder my&s;elf during the chace; this good pea&s;ant, whom you &s;ee here, in&s;i&s;ted on my par|taking a frugal repa&s;t in his cottage; but as I thought that I perceived &s;ome of the &s;oldiers of Pulauski roaming in the neighbourhood, I was de&s;irous of returning to War&s;aw immediately, and you will oblige me much by in&s;tantly accompanying me thither.</P>
<P>As to you, my friend, continues he, turning at the &s;ame time towards me, I am not at all &s;orry that you have given your&s;elf this u&s;ele&s;s trouble, for I am as much plea&s;ed at returning to my capital, attended by the&s;e gentlemen (pointing at the &s;ame time to the e&s;cort) as in accompanying you any farther. However, it would be improper that I &s;hould leave you without any recompen&s;e; what are you de&s;irous of? Speak&mdash;I will grant you any favour which you may demand of me.</P>
<P>Faublas, you may ea&s;ily conceive how much I was alarmed, for I was &s;till doubtful of the king's intentions. I endeavoured therefore to di&s;cover
<PB N="91" REF="032388_0090_0FF20E7AC2993110">
the true meaning of his equivocal di&s;cour&s;e, which mu&s;t be either full of a bitter irony, or a magnani|mous addre&s;s. M. de P&mdash; left me for &s;ome time in this cruel uncertainty: I behold you greatly embarra&s;&s;ed, continues he at length, with a gracious air; you know not what to choo&s;e! Come then, my friend, embrace me: there is indeed more honour than profit in embracing a king (adds he with a &s;mile); however, it mu&s;t be allowed, that in my place, many monarchs would not be at this moment &s;o generous as my&s;elf! On uttering the&s;e words, he in&s;tantly departs, leaving me penetrated with gratitude, and confounded with &s;o much true greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>However, the danger which the king had &s;o generou&s;ly relieved me from, began every moment to a&s;&s;ail me again. It was more than probable that a great number of couriers expedited from War&s;aw, had &s;pread about on all &s;ides the a&s;toni&s;hing news of the king's having been carried off. Already, without doubt, the ravi&s;hers were warmly pur&s;ued. My remarkable dre&s;s might betray me in my flight; and if I once more fell into the hands of any of the Ru&s;&s;ians, better informed of the circum&s;tance, all the efforts of the king would not be able to &s;ave me. Suppo&s;ing Pulauski had obtained all the &s;ucce&s;s which he expected, he mu&s;t &s;till be at a great di&s;tance; a

journey of ten more leagues at lea&s;t remained for me to perform, and my hor&s;e was entirely &s;pent with fatigue; I endeavoured, however, to &s;pur him on, but he had not got five hundred paces before he fell under me.</P>
<P>A cavalier, well mounted, happened to pa&s;s along the road by the &s;ide of me, at this very moment: he perceived the poor animal tumble down, and, thinking to amu&s;e him&s;elf at the expen&s;e of an unfortunate pea&s;ant, he began to banter me about my &s;ituation.&mdash;Piqued at this buffoonry, I re&s;olved to puni&s;h him for his raillery, and &s;ecure my own flight at one and the &s;ame time: I therefore in&s;tantly pre&s;ent one of my pi&s;tols to his brea&s;t, and oblige him to &s;urrender his own hor&s;e to me; nay, I acknowledge to you, that, forced by the peculiarity of my &s;itua|tion, I de&s;poiled him even of his cloak, which being very large, hid all my rags beneath it, which otherwi&s;e might have di&s;covered me. I then ca&s;t my pur&s;e full of gold at the feet of the a&s;toni&s;hed traveller, and &s;prang forward as fa&s;t as my new hor&s;e could carry me.</P>
<P>Luckily for me, he was fre&s;h and vigorous. I dart forward twelve leagues, with all the &s;wift|ne&s;s of an arrow: at length I think I hear the firing of cannon, and I in&s;tantly conjecture that my father-in-law was at hand, and was employed in fighting the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="032388_0092_0FF20E7E56D42978">I was not deceived&mdash;I arrive on the field of battle at the very moment when one of our regi|ments had given way. I in&s;tantly di&s;covered my&s;elf to the fugitives, and having rallied them beneath a neighbouring hill, I attack the enemies in flank, while Pulauski charges them in front with the remainder of his troops. Our manoeuvres were &s;o well concerted, and &s;o admirably executed, that the Ru&s;&s;ians were entirely routed, after ex|periencing a terrible carnage.</P>
<P>Pulauski deigned to attribute to me the honour of their defeat: Ah! cries he, embracing me, after hearing the particulars of my expedition&mdash; ah! if your forty followers had but equalled you in courage, the king would have been at this very moment in my camp! But the Deity does not will it. I am grateful, however, that you have been pre&s;erved to us; and I return you thanks for the important &s;ervice which you have ren|dered me: but for you, Kaluvski would have a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated the monarch, and my name would have been covered with an eternal opprobrium!</P>
<P>I might have been able, added he, to have advanced two miles farther; but I rather cho&s;e to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this re&s;pectable po&s;t, on account of the &s;ecurity of my camp. Ye&s;terday, in the cour&s;e of my march, I &s;urpri&s;ed, and cut in pieces, a party of Ru&s;&s;ians; this morning I beat

two more of their detachments; but another con&s;iderable corps having collected the remainder of the vanqui&s;hed, took advantage of the darkne&s;s of the night, on purpo&s;e to attack me. My &s;ol|diers, fatigued with the toil of a long march, and three &s;ucceeding engagements, began to fly; but victory returned to my camp at your approach. Let us entrench our&s;elves here; we will wait for the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and fight while we yet have a drop of blood remaining.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the camp re&s;ounded with the cries of gladne&s;s, and our victorious &s;oldiers mingled my prai&s;es with tho&s;e of Pulau&s;ki. At the noi&s;e of my name, repeated by a thou&s;and tongues, Lodoi&s;ka ran to her father's tent. She convinced me of the exce&s;s of her tenderne&s;s, by the exce&s;s of her joy at our meeting; and I was obliged once more to commence the recital of the dangers from which I had e&s;caped. She could not hear of the &s;ingular genero&s;ity of the monarch, when I was in the power of the Ru&s;&s;ians, without &s;hedding tears: how magnanimous he is, exclaims &s;he, amid&s;t a tran&s;port of joy; how worthy of being a king, he who &s;o generou&s;ly pardoned you! How many &s;ighs has he &s;pared a wife whom you for&s;ake! how many tears the loving wife whom you are not afraid of &s;acrificing! Cruel Lovzinski, are not the dangers to which you daily expo&s;e your&s;elf &s;ufficient&mdash;</P>

<P>Alas! replies &s;he in a mild accent, alas! mu&s;t I forever tremble for the life of a father and a hu&s;band! Lodoiska al&s;o made the mo&s;t affecting complaints to me, and &s;ighed after a more happy futurity, while fortune was preparing for us the mo&s;t cruel rever&s;e.</P>

<P>Pulauski, always ready, always active, was actually defending them: during the cour&s;e of this fatal night, he atchieved every thing that might have been expected from his valour and expe|rience.</P>
<P>We repel the a&s;&s;ailants no le&s;s than five different times; but they return uncea&s;ingly to the charge, pour in fre&s;h troops at every new attack, and, during the la&s;t one, penetrate into the heart of our very camp by three different avenues, and at one and the &s;ame time.</P>

<P>Believe me, &s;ays he, when I a&s;&s;ure you, whether you have engaged or not in this bold plot, that you ought to fly; leave your uniforms here, which will a&s;&s;uredly betray you: I will in&s;tantly &s;upply you with clothes which are le&s;s remarkable; and as to Lodoiska, I my&s;elf will conduct her to the place which you have cho&s;en for your retreat.</P>

<P>Pulauski repre&s;ents to his daughter, that &s;he was not able to &s;u&s;tain the fatigue incident to &s;uch a long journey, and that be&s;ides we &s;hould be liable to continual dangers.</P>
<P>The greater the peril is, replies &s;he, the more I ought to partake it with you. You have repeated to me a hundred times, that the daughter of Pulauski ought not to be an ordinary woman. For the la&s;t eight years I have con&s;tantly lived in the mid&s;t of alarms; I have &s;een nothing but

<P>Lodoiska did not appear in the lea&s;t affrighted at the long journey which we had to make; and as &s;he could neither be known nor &s;ought after, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon going out to reconnoitre the adjacent country, and at the &s;ame time charged her&s;elf with the fatiguing but important ta&s;k of bringing us the provi&s;ions which we &s;tood in need of.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the day appeared, we retired into the woods; hid either in the trunks of trees, or in the thick groves of pines, we waited impatiently for the return of night, on purpo&s;e to continue our march. It was thus, that, during &s;everal weeks, we were enabled to e&s;cape from the &s;earch of a multitude of different bodies of Ru&s;&s;ian troops, who were &s;ent out on purpo&s;e to di&s;cover us, and who pur&s;ued us like &s;o many blood hounds, animated with the pa&s;&s;ions of hatred and revenge.</P>
<P>One day as Lodoiska, &s;till di&s;gui&s;ed as a pea&s;ant, was returning from a neighbouring hamlet, where &s;he had gone on purpo&s;e to purcha&s;e the provi&s;ions which &s;he was now conveying to us, two Ru&s;&s;ian marauders attacked her at the entry of the fore&s;t in which we were concealed.</P>
<P>After having robbed, they prepared to &s;trip her. At the &s;hrieks which &s;he uttered, we ha&s;tened

from our retreat, and the two ru&s;&s;ians immediately betake them&s;elves to flight upon our appearance: but we were greatly alarmed left they &s;hould recount this adventure to their companions, who&s;e &s;u&s;picions, arou&s;ed by this &s;ingular rencounter, might induce them to come and drag us from our a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>After a mo&s;t fatiguing journey, we entered Pole&s;ia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pole&s;ia is a name given to the palatinate of Bre&s;te, in Lithuania; Bre&s;te, Brie&s;cia, or Bre&s;&s;ici, is &s;ituated upon the banks of the river Bog.</NOTE> Pulauski wept at leaving his native country.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t, exclaims he, with a mournful accent&mdash;at lea&s;t I have faithfully &s;erved you, and I now only go into exile, that I may be enabled to &s;erve you again.</P>
<P>So many fatigues had exhau&s;ted the &s;trength of Lodoiska. Arrived at Novogorod,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There are &s;everal towns of this name in Ru&s;&s;ia. This &s;eems to have been Novogorod Welicki, or Great Novogorod, the capital of a duchy of the &s;ame name.</NOTE> we re&s;olved to &s;top there on purpo&s;e to give her time to recover her &s;trength. It was our de&s;ign to remain for &s;ome days, but &s;ome of the country people whom we que&s;tioned, frankly informed us, that a number of troops were in motion, in that neigh|bourhood, on purpo&s;e to arre&s;t a certain per&s;on of

the name of Pulauski, who had occa&s;ioned the king of Poland to be taken pri&s;oner, and carried off from the mid&s;t of his own capital.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tly alarmed at this intelligence, we remain but a few hours in this town, where we, however, found means to purcha&s;e &s;ome hor&s;es without being di&s;covered.</P>
<P>We then pa&s;&s;ed the De&s;na, above Czernicove;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Czernicove, or Czernikou, is a con&s;iderable town, and is the capital of the duchy of the &s;ame name. It is &s;ituate on the river De&s;na, 75 miles north-ea&s;t of Kiow.</NOTE> and following the banks of the Sula, we cro&s;s that river at Perevoloczna, where we learn, that Pulau&s;ki, who had been traced to Novogorod, had e&s;caped, as it were, by miracle, and that the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers, indefatigable in their pur&s;ue were &s;till &s;earching after him, and were in hopes of making him pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>It was now again become nece&s;&s;ary to fly once more, and once more to change our route; we therefore in&s;tantly made for the immen&s;e fore&s;ts which cover the face of the country between the Sula and the Zem, in the dark retreats of which we hoped to find &s;helter from our foes.</P>
<P>We at length di&s;cover a cavern, in which we were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of taking up our abode. A &s;he-bear di&s;putes with us the entrance
<PB N="104" REF="032388_0103_0FF20ED068655AB8">
into this a&s;ylum, equally &s;olitary and frightful: we a&s;&s;ail, we kill her, and devour her young.</P>
<P>Pulau&s;ki was wounded in this encounter: Lodoi&s;ka, worn out with fatigue and di&s;tre&s;s, was &s;carcely able to &s;upport her exi&s;tence: the winter was approaching, and the cold was already exce&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Pur&s;ued by the Ru&s;&s;ians in the inhabited parts; menaced by wild and ferocious animals in this va&s;t de&s;ert: de&s;titute of any arms but our &s;words; reduced in a &s;hort time to eat our very hor&s;es; what was to become of us?</P>
<P>The danger of the &s;ituation to which my father-in-law and my wife were reduced, had become &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, that no other fear any longer alarmed me. My per&s;onal &s;afety, hitherto &s;o dear to me, did not now &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf once to my mind: I felt only for their's. I re&s;olved, therefore, to procure for them at any rate, tho&s;e &s;uccours which their &s;ituation required, which was &s;till more deplorable than my own; and leaving them both with the promi&s;e of rejoining them in a &s;hort time, I take a few of the diamonds belonging to Lodoi&s;ka, and follow the &s;tream of the Warsklo.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, my dear Faublas, that a traveller, bewildered amid&s;t tho&s;e va&s;t countries, and reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of wandering about without a compa&s;s, and without a guide, is obliged

to follow the cour&s;e of a river, becau&s;e it is upon its banks that the habitations of mankind are mo&s;t commonly to be met with.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould gain, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome con&s;iderable town in which a few merchants re&s;ided: I therefore journeyed along the banks of the War&s;klo, and travelling day and night, found my&s;elf at Pultava<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pultoway, Pultowa, or Pultava, is a fortified town in the Ukraine, famous for a battle fought in its neighbourhood be|tween Charles XII. of Sweden, and Peter the Great of Ru&s;&s;ia. It is 100 miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Bielgorod, from which Lovzin&s;ki pretended to have come on purpo&s;e to purcha&s;e merchandize, &amp;c.</NOTE> at the end of four days. During my re&s;idence in this place, I pa&s;s for a trader belonging to Bielgorod. I there learn that the Ru&s;&s;ian troops were &s;till roaming about in pur&s;uit of Pulauski, and that the empre&s;s had &s;ent an exact de&s;cription of his per&s;on every where, with orders to &s;eize him either dead or alive, wherever he might be found.</P>
<P>I make ha&s;te to &s;ell my diamonds, to purcha&s;e powder, arms, and provi&s;ions of all kinds, different uten&s;ils, and &s;ome coar&s;e but nece&s;&s;ary furniture; every thing, in fine, which I judged mo&s;t proper to relieve our mi&s;ery, and &s;often our misfortunes. With the&s;e I load a waggon, drawn by four good hor&s;es, of which I was the only conductor.</P>
<P>My return was equally tedious and difficult;
<PB N="106" REF="032388_0105_0FF20ED5B9DDBC68">
no le&s;s than eight whole days expired before I arrived at the entrance of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>It was there that terminating my di&s;agreeable and dangerous journey, I was about to &s;uccour my father-in-law and my wife; and I was about to revi&s;it all that was mo&s;t dear to me in the world; and yet my dear Faublas, I felt none of tho&s;e tran&s;ports of joy which &s;uch an event &s;eemed likely to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Your philo&s;ophers have no belief in forebo|dings.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, however, my dear friend, that I experienced an involuntary unea&s;ine&s;s: my mind became di&s;pirited, di&s;mayed, and &s;omething, I know not what, &s;eemed to whi&s;per to me, that the mo&s;t unhappy moment of my whole life was fa&s;t approaching.</P>
<P>On my departure I had placed &s;everal flint &s;tones at certain di&s;tances, on purpo&s;e to enable me to retrace my road; but I could not now di&s;cover them. I had al&s;o cut off with my &s;abre large pieces of the bark of &s;everal trees, which I could not now perceive: I enter the fore&s;t, however: I holla with all my &s;trength: I di&s;|charge my gun from time to time, but nobody an&s;wers me. I dared not tru&s;t my&s;elf among the trees and &s;hrubs for fear of lo&s;ing my way back; neither could I wander too far from my waggon,
<PB N="107" REF="032388_0106_0FF20E9371EC70F8">
which was &s;tored with provi&s;ions &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Pulauski, his daughter, and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The night, which now approached, obliged me to give over my &s;earch, and I pa&s;s it in the &s;ame manner as the former. Rolled up in my cloak, I lay down beneath my waggon, which I had carefully &s;urrounded with my larger movables, and which thus &s;erved me as a rampart again&s;t the wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>I could not &s;leep; the cold was extremely inten&s;e; the &s;now fell in great abundance: at break of day I looked around, and found all the ground covered with it. From that moment I formed the mo&s;t horrible and the mo&s;t &s;ini&s;ter pre&s;ages: the &s;tones, which might have pointed out the path I was to have taken, were all buried, and it appeared impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould ever be able to di&s;cover my father-in-law and my wife.</P>
<P>Had the hor&s;e, which I left with them at my departure, afforded them &s;ufficient &s;u&s;tenance ever &s;ince? Had not hunger, cruel hunger, obliged them to fly from their retreat? Were they &s;till concealed in tho&s;e frightful de&s;erts? If they were not there, where &s;hould I be able to find them? Where, without them, &s;hould I drag out my mi&s;erable exi&s;tence? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="032388_0107_0FF20EBE55BC50D8">But could I believe that Pulauski had aban|doned his &s;on-in-law? that Lodoiska had con&s;ented to &s;eparate her&s;elf from her hu&s;band? No&mdash; undoubtedly not. They were &s;till confined within the circle of this frightful &s;olitude; and if I abandoned them, they mu&s;t die with famine and with cold! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>
<P>The&s;e de&s;perate reflections at length determined my conduct, and I no longer examined whether or not in removing at a di&s;tance from my waggon, I was in danger of never finding it again. To carry &s;ome provi&s;ions to my father-in-law and wife, to &s;uccour Pulauski and Lodoiska&mdash;the&s;e were now the only &s;entiments that occupied my mind.</P>
<P>I accordingly &s;eize my fowling-piece, take &s;ome powder and &s;hot, and load one of my hor&s;es with nece&s;&s;aries: I pierce into the woods, much farther than during the former evening. I again holla with all my &s;trength; I again make frequent di&s;charges with my gun. The mo&s;t melancholy &s;ilence reigned all around me.</P>
<P>I now find my&s;elf in a part of the fore&s;t where the trees were &s;o extremely thick, that there was no longer any pa&s;&s;age for my hor&s;e: I, therefore tie him to a tree, and my de&s;pair getting the better of

every other con&s;ideration, I &s;till continue to ad|vance with my gun and part of my provi&s;ions. I had now wandered about for two hours more, my inquietude forcing me every moment to double my pace, when at length I perceive human foot&s;teps imprinted upon the &s;now.</P>
<P>Hope gives me new &s;trength, and I therefore in&s;tantly follow the traces which were &s;till fre&s;h. Soon after I di&s;covered Pulauski almo&s;t naked, emaciated with hunger, and &s;o changed as &s;carce to be known even by me!</P>
<P>He makes all the efforts in his power to drag his limbs towards me, and to reply to my enquiries. The moment that I had rejoined him, he &s;eizes, with avidity, on the victuals that I pre&s;ented to him, and devours them in an in&s;tant. I then demand of him where Lodoiska is.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;ays he, you will &s;ee her there! The tone of voice in which he pronounced the&s;e words, made me tremble. I run to, I arrive at, the cavern, but too well prepared for the melancholy &s;pectacle that awaited me. Lodoiska, wrapped up in her own clothes, and covered with tho&s;e of her father, was extended upon a bed of half rotten leaves!</P>
<P>She rai&s;es, with &s;ome difficulty, her weary head, and refu&s;ing the aliments which I now offer her, addre&s;&s;es me as follows:&mdash;I am not hungry!

<P>Her father digs a grave for her at a little di&s;tance from the cavern; and I behold the earth inclo&s;e all that I loved in this world! * * * * * *</P>
<P>What a trying moment! Pulauski alone prevented me from becoming the victim of de&s;pair: he forces me to &s;urvive Lodoiska! * * * * * * *</P>
<P>Lovzinski now endeavours to continue his narrative, but his tears prevent his utterance. He demands leave to retire for a moment, pa&s;&s;es into a neighbouring apartment, and returns in a &s;hort time after with a miniature in his hand.</P>

<P>With his eyes &s;till diffu&s;ed with tears, which he &s;trives to retain, Lovzin&s;ki re&s;umes the hi&s;tory of his misfortunes, in a voice overcome as it were with their exce&s;s:</P>
<P>Pulau&s;ki, who&s;e courage never abandoned him, and who&s;e &s;trength was by this time re&s;tored, obliges me to occupy my&s;elf jointly with him, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of procuring our &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>By following along the &s;now the prints of my foot&s;teps, we arrive at length at the place where I had left my waggon, which we immediately unload, and burn &s;oon after, on purpo&s;e to withhold from our enemies the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;u&s;pi|cion of the place of our retreat.</P>
<P>By the aid of our hor&s;es, for which we procure

a pa&s;&s;age by making a circuitous journey, in&s;tead of attempting to bring them &s;traight to the place of our retreat, we were at length able to tran&s;port tho&s;e provi&s;ions and moveables to our cavern, which it was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for us to procure, and to hu&s;band, if we re&s;olved to remain much longer in this &s;olitude. We &s;oon after killed our hor&s;es, which we were unable to &s;upply with food. We lived upon their fle&s;h, which the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on pre&s;erved for a con&s;iderable time; it corrupted, however, at length; and our fire-arms being unable to procure us any other than a &s;canty &s;upply of game, we were obliged to have recour&s;e to our provi&s;ions; which, at the end of three months, were entirely con&s;umed.</P>
<P>Some gold, and the greater part of Lodoiska's diamonds, &s;till remained. Should I make a &s;econd voyage to Pultava? or &s;hould we both run the hazard of &s;uch an undertaking, and quit our retreat in company? We had already &s;uffered &s;o much, and &s;o cruelly in this fore&s;t, that we re&s;olved to embrace the latter re&s;olution.</P>

<P>Approach, adds Pulauski; behold at a little di&s;tance from, and in the mid&s;t of the carnage that &s;urrounds us, among &s;uch a croud of famous warriors, a warrior celebrated even in the mid&s;t of them, by his ma&s;culine courage, his early talents, and his virtues truly republican.

<P>It is young Fayette, already an honour to France, and a &s;courge to tyrants: but he has &s;carce begun his immortal labours!</P>
<P>Envy his fate, Lovzinski; endeavour to imitate his virtues, and follow as near as po&s;&s;ible the &s;teps of &s;o great a man. He, the worthy pupil of a Wa&s;hington, &s;hall &s;oon be the Wa&s;hington of his own country.

<P>Then, Lovzinski, in whatever place thou maye&s;t be, let thy hate re-kindle! Again combat gloriou&s;ly on the &s;ide of Poland.</P>
<P>Let the remembrance of our injuries, and of our &s;ucce&s;&s;es, call forth thy courage!

<P>My friend, I fought for the United States of America, until the happy peace which in&s;ured their independence. M. de C&mdash; who had &s;erved along with me, and who was attached to the <HI>corps</HI> commanded by the marquis de la Fayette &mdash;M. de C&mdash; gave me a letter of recommen|dation to the baron de Faublas. Your father took &s;uch a lively intere&s;t in my fate, that in a very &s;hort time we were connected together by the bonds of the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I only quitted the province in which he re&s;ided, on purpo&s;e to come and live in Paris, where I knew that he would not be long in following me.</P>
