<P>AS the Chri&s;tian Religion comes addre&s;&s;ed to the rea&s;on and un|der&s;tanding of men, &s;o the more we examine and con&s;ider it, we &s;hall find it to be one va&s;t con&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme, commencing almo&s;t as early as the cre|ation of the world, and terminating on|ly in the redemption of all mankind. INFIDELS who have neither temper nor abilities for inve&s;tigating the merits of Chri&s;tianity, may cavil at particular pa&s;&s;ages in &s;acred hi&s;tory, and bring the
<PB N="6" REF="013219_0005_0F8FB6409FE36420">
charge of ab&s;urdity again&s;t the <HI>whole.</HI>&mdash;RELIGIONISTS may urge the various tenets they have adopted, with an un|hallowed and illiberal zeal; adducing each in &s;upport of his opinion &s;ome texts of &s;cripture&mdash;But men who have taken up their religion from the con|viction of their minds&mdash;from calmly revolving the evidence by which it is &s;upported&mdash;as well as its conformity to the rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things&mdash;are not to be &s;haken in their principles by the &s;coffs of unbelievers, or the bigotry of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>As this therefore is the day on which the great founder of our religion deign|ed to become fle&s;h and dwell among us, I cannot more u&s;efully employ your time and my own than, in pointing out the harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the
<PB N="7" REF="013219_0006_0F8FB6412A6ABFD8">
Old and New Te&s;taments in relation to the promi&s;ed MESSIAH. And let me be permitted to hope that, as every in-individual is concerned to "know the certainty of tho&s;e things wherein he hath been in&s;tructed,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Luke, i. 4.</NOTE> you will favour me with a &s;erious attention, whil&s;t I endea|vour, in as &s;ummary a way as the &s;ub|ject will admit of, to prove, that all things which were written in the law of Mo&s;es, and in the Prophets, and in the P&s;alms, concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, have had their literal completion in the per|&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>One of the brighte&s;t ornaments of this or of any other age,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord Lyttleton.</NOTE> after having him&s;elf written very excellently upon the character of St. Paul, hath taken upon him to affirm, that if every part of the

&s;criptures was lo&s;t, &s;ave what related to this Apo&s;tle's conver&s;ion, he would undertake to prove the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion from <HI>it</HI> alone. If then it &s;hall appear that a &s;eries of pro|phecies, the la&s;t of them written near four hundred years before the events they pretend to foretel, at this time pre&s;erved entire in the original Chaldee and Hebrew languages, and tran&s;lated into Greek by &s;eventy interpreters two hundred and &s;ixty years before the birth of Chri&s;t, have all had their critical ful|fillment in HIM; &s;urely, &s;uch demon&s;tra|ble evidence mu&s;t operate with all its force upon every &s;incere and candid en|quirer. And when we further con&s;ider that prophane hi&s;tory, from its earlie&s;t dates, all along concurs with the ac|counts left us by the &s;acred writers, we
<PB N="9" REF="013219_0008_0F8FB644396F56B0">
are compelled to exclaim with the Jew|i&s;h High-Prie&s;t, though with a very different meaning, "what need have we of further witne&s;&s;es!" Many of the antient prophecies indeed are &s;o &s;trong and pointed, that they &s;eem ra|ther to be an hi&s;tory of facts tran&s;acted during the lives of their authors, than the predictions of men in&s;pired with the knowledge of future events. Of this &s;ort is the prophecy of JACOB&mdash;who, at lea&s;t a thou&s;and years before the la&s;t de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, &s;o exactly fore|told the aera of the Me&s;&s;iah's birth, that we may venture to &s;ay of it what the noble author already quoted &s;aid of St. Paul's conver&s;ion, and re&s;t the proof of Chri&s;tianity upon this prophecy alone.</P>

But this will be con&s;idered in its pro|per order. Previous to it, let us take notice of the promi&s;e made by the Al|mighty, immediately after the di&s;obe|dience of our fir&s;t progenitors&mdash;"I will put enmity, &s;aith God, between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed, it &s;hall bruize thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 15.</NOTE>&mdash;Here opens the fir&s;t &s;cene of that grand dra|ma, which was to be accompli&s;hed at Jeru&s;alem.

<P>FOR more than two thou&s;and years after the date of this promi&s;e, no fur|ther intimation was given of the Me&s;&s;i|ah, idolatry had &s;pread it&s;elf almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally throughout the world, and even the memory of the creation &s;eem|ed to be gradually wearing away. Amid&s;t this univer&s;al depravity, it plea|&s;ed God, "who&s;e promi&s;es are yea and amen," to ratify the covenant made with our fir&s;t parents, and to declare that in the family and line of ABRAHAM, "all the nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii. 18. xxii. 18. xxvi. 4.</NOTE> And &s;urely&mdash;if a deliver|ance from the cur&s;e of a violated com|mand,

<P>THE fir&s;t particular predicted of Ju|dah is, that he is <HI>the per&s;on whom his brethren &s;hould prai&s;e</HI>&mdash;And it is one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular circum&s;tances in hi&s;|tory, that, whil&s;t the &s;everal tribes were di&s;per&s;ed by contending Monarchs, through various and di&s;tant kingdoms, and no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in their nation|al capacity, the tribe of Judah alone pre&s;erved, even in captivity, the liber|ty of being governed by its own laws and ordinances. To account for this &s;tupendous occurrence from the com|bination of what are called natural cau|&s;es, would be as weak as impious. We mu&s;t look up to an higher &s;ource, to to the great FIRST CAUSE of all, who&s;e wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s were
<PB N="15" REF="013219_0014_0F8FB64BC6E30408">
concerned for the pre&s;ervation of the true religion, and who&s;e om|nipotence effected &s;o wonderful an event.</P>
<P>AND, that <HI>the hand</HI> of the de&s;cen|dant <HI>of Judah was in the neck of his enemies,</HI> let the miraculous e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Chri&s;t's religion declare. So rapid was its progre&s;s, that, within a &s;ingle century after the re&s;urrection, the &s;ound of the go&s;pel had literally gone forth into all lands, and there was not a nation in the then known world, in which it was not embraced by many. Philo&s;ophy had previou&s;ly exerted its whole force for the reformation of man|kind, and was proved to be in&s;ufficient. But no &s;ooner did the great Legi&s;lator of the Chri&s;tians enter upon his office,
<PB N="16" REF="013219_0015_0F8FB64C79BF2C30">
than the e&s;tabli&s;hments which men had combined and &s;et up, fell pro&s;trate be|fore him&mdash;&s;uper&s;tition retired to her cell&mdash;and the kingdom of Satan trem|bled to its center. Idolatry, which had &s;o long maintained its empire, began gradually to decline&mdash;the boa&s;ted Del|phic oracles forbore to give re&s;pon&s;es&mdash;and thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands were daily brought home to Je&s;us.</P>
<P>BUT enquire now, what is become of the tribe of Judah, and hi&s;tory will in|form you that, not long after the birth of Chri&s;t, it was &s;tripped of all its privileges, and reduced to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t abject va&s;&s;alage. Its &s;cepter, and whatever el&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed this once famous tribe, were forcibly taken away, and ve&s;ted in a foreign power&mdash;

The&s;e &s;eventeen hundred years have they been &s;laves all over the world, nor do they yet find any mitigation of their &s;lavery.</NOTE> Thus faithfully accom|pli&s;hed was this prophecy of Jacob; which &s;o exactly foretold the time of the Me&s;&s;iah's coming, that when the man of Nazareth was born, all the ea&s;t|ern world was "looking for the con|&s;olation of I&s;rael"&mdash;And the Jews, in excu&s;e for their rejecting Je&s;us, were driven to a&s;&s;ert, either that the true

<P>MUCH depends upon a&s;certaining the preci&s;e period of the Me&s;&s;iah's appear|ance; and it has therefore been unan|&s;werably &s;hewn by the labors of the learned, to have been immediately af|ter the expiration of the Prophet Dani|el's weeks, [or years,] and at the time predicted by Haggai and Malachi.
