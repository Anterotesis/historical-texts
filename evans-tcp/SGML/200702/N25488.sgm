<HEAD>A &s;hort <HI>SKETCH,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MR. LENT MUNSON, the &s;on of Lieut. <HI>Levi Mun&s;on,</HI> now of Harwinton, in Connecticut, was born in <HI>Wallingford,</HI> the 3d of March 1768. In the 10th year of his age, he entered as a mu&s;ician into the Continental Army, where he continued until the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace; after which he joined the family, who had in his ab&s;ence removed to Harwinton. Here he re&s;ided until the year 1787, when he again entered into the &s;ervice of his country, in the corps rai&s;ed by Col. David Humphreys, with the rank of Sergeant-Mu&s;ician. The &s;hort duration of that command &s;oon left him again under the direction of his parents, where he continued until the year 1788,&mdash; when he once more determined upon a military life. Ac|cordingly he went to Hartford, and engaged for the term of three years; and joined the army at Fort Harmer, in the We&s;tern Country; where he performed the duty of Mu&s;ician until early in the year 1789, when he was ad|vanced to the rank of Quarter Ma&s;ter-Sergeant to the garri&s;on, in both of which &s;tations his conduct was un|exceptionable. In December 1790, orders came out at Fort Wa&s;hington, where Mr. <HI>Mun&s;on</HI> then was &s;tationed, for re-enli&s;ting the men. He engaged for three years more, and was &s;oon after ordered to Connecticut on the recruiting &s;ervice. He was &s;tationed at Middletown, where he continued in that duty until 1793, when he joined the army again at Fort Wa&s;hington. During his re&s;idence at Middletown, he cultivated an acquaintance with many re&s;pectable inhabitants of that city, who not|with&s;tanding his humble rank in life, di&s;covered his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">l <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and treated him with the politene&s;s and re&s;pect <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;erved. The attention paid him at this and other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> had a tendency to wean him from the army, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> drawn up in his mind a determination, after the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> his pre&s;ent engagements, to obtain his bread <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> means.

the army, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;ent on a detachment, as an e&s;cort to provi&s;ion, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the command of Lieut. <HI>Loury.</HI> On the 17th of October, the party was attacked by the Savages, and totally defeated: The officers, and many of the &s;ol|diers, were killed: Mr. <HI>Mun&s;on,</HI> being with others mi&s;s|ing, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be among&s;t the &s;lain.</P>
<P>The melancholy tidings of this unhappy affair, were communicated to the family, and other friends, who la|mented his untimely end, with all the bitterne&s;s of grief natural to the circum&s;tances of his &s;uppo&s;ed death.</P>
<P>But Providence had re&s;erved him for other &s;cenes. Finding no hopes in flight, he had determined to act the part of a &s;oldier, and &s;ell his life as dear as po&s;|&s;ible; but being quite &s;pent with fatigue, he was &s;oon di&s;armed by the Savages, and &s;tript of all his clothes, ex|cept &s;hoes, &s;ocks, and overalls. They gave him in ex|change an old Indian coat, and the &s;econd day an old &s;hirt. In this dre&s;s he was driven five or &s;ix days; the Indians on hor&s;eback &s;till riding upon his heels, till his &s;trength was almo&s;t wholly exhau&s;ted, and he more than once con|cluded, he could &s;truggle no longer with his fate, but mu&s;t &s;eek a refuge in the &s;hades of death. On the third day after his capture they painted him, in token of life and pardon. Each night he was fa&s;t bound, and placed between two Savages; &s;o that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping from them. They moreover had left the place of action in &s;uch ha&s;te, for fear of pur&s;uit, that they could take but very little provi&s;ion; in con&s;equence of which the pri&s;oners had the additional mi&s;ery of hunger to en|counter. There were eleven taken; but one of the un|happy number, being unable to travel at the unmerciful rate the Savages required, was killed: The other ten ar|rived at an Indian town, belonging to the Ottawa tribe. For &s;everal days after their arrival, Mr. <HI>Mun&s;on</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|able to walk: On the 11th of his captivity they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> hair, and put a jewel in his no&s;e; they attempt<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> cut his ears, which he re&s;i&s;ted with &s;uch &s;pirit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">verance that they finally did not in&s;i&s;t on his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.

cu&s;tom was to let it putrify before they ate it, he could not partake of their repa&s;t, and to &s;tay in their huts at meal time was almo&s;t intolerable.</P>
<P>In this wretched &s;ituation he continued for eight months, compelled to hard labour;&mdash;almo&s;t without clothing ex|po&s;ed to the inclemencies of the winter &s;ea&s;on, far remo|ved from all his friends who, ignorant of his fate, &s;up|po&s;ed him beyond all the troubles of this life.&mdash;His forti|tude, however, did not for&s;ake him;&mdash;he revolved in his mind various plans for e&s;caping from them: But being a &s;tranger to the country thro' which he mu&s;t pa&s;s, ignorant of the cour&s;e he ought to &s;teer, and be&s;et with the jealous vigilance of his enemies, he &s;till found in&s;urmountable ob|&s;tables before him. Having however by much com|plai&s;ance and &s;eeming tranquillity, flattered his Ma&s;ter into a &s;ecurity, he came to the determination of taking his gun, and tru&s;ting him&s;elf to fortune: But before he had put this hazardous experiment in execution, he happily met with an Engli&s;h trader, who &s;ugge&s;ted a &s;afer method. After receiving from this trader the point of compa&s;s he ought to ob&s;erve, and other u&s;eful directions, on the 17th of June he left them in a profound &s;leep; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the light of the moon, which was now ri&s;ing, he took his unknown way through the uninhabited wilderne&s;s, amid the &s;olemn &s;ilence of the night. He travelled till the dawn of day, when he &s;ecreted him&s;elf in &s;ome weeds and gra&s;s, about 15 rods from a kind of road in which he travelled. In this &s;ituation he &s;aw two of his enemies pur&s;uing after him on hor&s;eback. In about an hour and a half they re|turned the &s;ame way. The next night he pur&s;ued his cour&s;e, and arrived at &s;ome French &s;ettlement, where the people &s;hewed him kindne&s;s. Having wa&s;hed the paint from his face, and refre&s;hed him&s;elf, about day-break he continued his rout, and travelling 26 miles, about 11 o'clock he came to another &s;ettlement. He had but ju&s;t &s;tepped into the hou&s;e, when accidentally looking out at the window, he &s;aw twelve Indians cro&s;&s;ing a river within twelve rods of the hou&s;e. The gentleman proved to be friendly, and concealed him in an upper loft for his &s;ecurity in ca&s;e they had entered: But they pur&s;ued the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">hich he came; &s;o that had he been ten minutes

later, he mu&s;t inevitably have fallen into their hands,&mdash; the fatal con&s;equences of which are ea&s;ily conceived. Here he &s;tayed two days, and the people &s;hewed him much kindne&s;s. The Lady gave him a good &s;hirt, and a hat, the fir&s;t which had been on his head in eight months;&mdash; they procured him a pa&s;&s;age by water to Detroit, and gave him a &s;ufficient quantity of provi&s;ions for the journey. Such are the ble&s;&s;ed fruits of benevolence!&mdash;When he arrived at that fortre&s;s, Col. <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the commanding officer, was no le&s;s benevolent: He gave him a plenty of provi&s;ions, and a pa&s;sport;&mdash;put him on board of a ve&s;&s;el in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and &s;ent him to Niagara, where he met with a number of New-England gentlemen, who&s;e liberality &s;upplied him with nece&s;&s;aries to complete his journey. Capt. <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> late of Durham, and Mr. <HI>Salmon Goodrich,</HI> of Berlin, were of the number of the&s;e gentlemen, who&s;e kindne&s;s did honour both to them&s;elves and their country, and who&s;e names Mr. <HI>Mun&s;on</HI> hath frequently mentioned with gratitude.</P>
<P>Here, after eight months of almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant fatigue of body and mind, he took a &s;hort repo&s;e; and afterwards getting a pa&s;&s;age by water to Skenectady, on the 21&s;t of July he again arrived at his Father's hou&s;e. The joy and &s;urpri&s;e of his Parents, on receiving again that Son to their arms whom they had thought no longer an inhabitant of this world;&mdash;whom they had mourned as dead for many &s;orrowful months, is much better conceived than expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mun&s;on's</HI> military career here ended. After &s;tay|ing a &s;hort time with his friends, in Harwinton, he re|paired to Middletown, where he gladdened the hearts of his acquaintance, and with whom he con&s;ulted upon the future plans of his life. As the &s;eas &s;eemed to open the faire&s;t pro&s;pect for him towards wealth and re&s;pectability, he applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of navigation, and &s;oon became ma&s;ter of it. His earne&s;t de&s;ire of perfecting him&s;elf in the maritime profe&s;&s;ion, induced him to &s;hip on board a ve&s;&s;el as a raw hand, in an European voyage. The &s;everal duties to which he was called, during the un|dertaking, were performed with &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and

di&s;patch, that in his &s;ettlement with the owners, on his return, they allowed him Four Dollars a month for extra &s;ervices. He remained with his friends a &s;hort time, ar|ranging his affairs for another voyage, which he under|took for the We&s;t-Indies. This voyage proved his la&s;t: He was captured by the French, and carried into the i&s;land of St. Croix a pri&s;oner, where he was &s;eized with a vio|lent fever, which in a &s;hort time put an end to his labours. He died on the 21&s;t of Sept. 1796;&mdash;after a toil&s;ome life of 28 years, 6 months, and 18 days,&mdash;11 years and four months of which was &s;pent in the &s;ervice of his country.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of his travels, he had contracted an ac|quaintance with many worthy and re&s;pectable people: As their friend&s;hip for him was wholly di&s;intere&s;ted, the un|u&s;ual warmth of their affection, affords us the highe&s;t en|comium upon his character.&mdash;"The opportunity I had of knowing him (&s;aith one of the&s;e, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>JOHN PRATT,</HI> of <HI>Middletown,</HI> in a letter to Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> dated <HI>December 9</HI>th, <HI>17<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6</HI></NOTE>) licences me to de|clare, that he was hone&s;t, prudent, charitable, and ju&s;t in all his dealings:&mdash;That po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e qualities, together with an amiable di&s;po&s;ition, he bid fair to honour &s;ociety, make his family happy, and him&s;elf re&s;pected. Tho&s;e who knew him, loved and re&s;pected him; tho&s;e who may know his character, if they have any regard to merit, will revere his memory. The above ob&s;ervations I have made to you without &s;olicitation: I have offered them as a te&s;ti|mony of my great e&s;teem and regard for a decea&s;ed friend; and let me a&s;&s;ure you, they fall far &s;hort of the evidence I feel within me."</P>
<P>Lieut. <HI>Mun&s;on</HI> who&s;e family, con&s;i&s;ting of eight &s;ons and a daughter, had many of them often been engaged in the &s;ervice of the public, and con&s;equently di&s;per&s;ed into va|rious parts of the country, had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the mo&s;t of them together on the 11th day of January <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">2,&mdash; a plea&s;ure well known to tho&s;e who are parents. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con|&s;equence of this favour, he had de&s;ired his neighbours and friends to meet with him and his family at the Hou&s;e
