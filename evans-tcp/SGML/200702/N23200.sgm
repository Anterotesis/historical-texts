<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>LET the &s;ons and daughters of af|fliction receive comfort from hope.&mdash;The motion of the &s;unbeams on the wave, is not more uncertain than the condition of human life: mi&s;ery, therefore, has much to hope, and happine&s;s much to fear; but vir|tue has always a re&s;ource in Providence, which not on|ly improves the ble&s;&s;ings, but mitigates the evils of life.</P>
<P>In a plea&s;ant valley of Me&s;opotamia, on the banks of the Irwan lived Solyman, the &s;on of Ardavan the &s;age. He was early in&s;tructed in all the learning of the ea&s;t; but as his under&s;tanding opened he grew weary of the labours of &s;tudy, and thir&s;ted only for the knowledge of mankind. With much importun|ity he prevailed on his father to permit him to travel. "My &s;on," &s;aid Ardavan, "let not your curio&s;ity interrupt your happine&s;s: all that nature can give you is in the valley of Irwan, here you are cheri&s;hed by the eye of affection, and indulged with all the bounties of the eternal &s;un. Travel is often danger|ous, and always inconvenient: your knowledge of men may be purcha&s;ed by experiencing their treache|ry, their cruelty and their pride; the un&s;u&s;pecting innocence of your heart will expo&s;e you to the de&s;igns of the &s;elfi&s;h, and the in&s;olence of the vain; you will
<PB N="4" REF="030671_0003_0FE85B3BB9BEF968">
wander from place to place, only for amu&s;ement; as your heart can have no connections that time or in|tere&s;t have rendered dear to you, you will be little af|fected by any thing you &s;ee: and, what is more than all, your virtue will be endangered; when you be|hold the univer&s;al prevalence of vice, when your eye is attracted by the flowery paths in which &s;he &s;eems to tread, you will find it difficult to with&s;tand the force of example, and the blandi&s;hments of plea&s;ure." Solyman humbled him&s;elf, and replied&mdash;"Prince of the &s;ages that dwell between the rivers, let your ear be patient to the words of youth. Can Ardavan doubt the integrity of the heart, which his precepts have formed to virtue; or fear that Solyman &s;hould become the &s;lave of vice? I am not a &s;tranger to the manners of men, though I have mixed but little a|mong them; nor am I unacquainted with the tempt|ations to which I &s;hall be expo&s;ed, nor unprepared to with&s;tand them. Travel may be attended with &s;ome inconvenience, but it has many advantages: next to the knowledge of our&s;elves, mo&s;t valuable is the knowledge of nature; and this is to be acquired only by attending her through the variety of her works; the more we behold of the&s;e, the more our ideas are enlarged and extended; and the nobler and more worthy conceptions we mu&s;t entertain of that Pow|er who is the parent of univer&s;al being."</P>
<P>"My &s;on," &s;aid Ardavan, "if you are determin|ed to travel, let your ear attend to the in&s;truction of age. Move not one pace from the valley of Irwan, if your heart rely not on the Eternal Providence; it is that confidence alone which mu&s;t &s;upport you un|der all the po&s;&s;ible contingencies of di&s;tre&s;s: O let it not depart from you; it is the &s;overeign antidote to the evils of live! the day is not lighted up in vain, let it not pa&s;s without the practice of virtue; dare not to behold the everla&s;ting &s;un go down, if thou ha&s;t wa&s;t|ed his light in idlene&s;s, or vanity: ignorance, mi&s;ery, or want, will always afford thee the means of benifi|cence."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030671_0004_0FE85B3D49D0B5E8">"May that Immortal Being, who&s;e eye is over all his creatures, &s;ave thee from folly and from vice! may his hand direct thee in the hour of negligence, and his &s;pirit guide thee through the maze of error! When thy mind &s;hall be enriched with the knowledge of his works, may he re&s;tore thee, more virtuous, to the valley of Irwan, to the arms of thy aged father! and may he forgive this tear, which proceeds not from a di&s;tru&s;t of his Providence, but falls for the lo&s;s of Solyman.</P>

<P>THE morning was &s;pread upon the mountains, and Solyman prepared to depart: but fir&s;t pro&s;trating him&s;elf towards the &s;un, he thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed that glorious luminary&mdash;"Incomparable, and everla&s;ting! thou that lighte&s;t up a thou&s;and worlds, and extende&s;t thy protecting power to the minute&s;t parts of nature! let thy univer&s;al eye look with favor upon Solyman. When I wander over the wa&s;tes of de&s;olation, may thy cheerful rays comfort and &s;upport me! when I go into the cities of men, maye&s;t thou &s;till look upon me; teach me to di&s;cover the dark de&s;igns of malignity, and to unfold the intricacies of fraud! &s;o maye&s;t thou ri&s;e with &s;evenfold lu&s;tre over the waves of Indus; &s;o maye&s;t thou be adorned by tho&s;e &s;avage nations who experience thy goodne&s;s without acknowl|edgment!" After this &s;hort addre&s;s he &s;ung the fol|lowing hymn.</P>

<P>When Solyman had fini&s;hed his devotions, he pa&s;&s;ed over the Tigris into the kingdom of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome &s;ecret attraction in the place where we have pa&s;&s;ed the cheerful innocence of childhood, that holds our heart to it during the remaining part of life. No &s;ooner had Solyman a&s;cended an eminence that gave him a retro&s;pective view of the valley of Ir|wan, than he turned his eye on his native fields, and gazed for &s;ome time with a kind of pen&s;ive compla|cency. "Happy &s;cenes," &s;aid he, "where I have be|held the everla&s;ting &s;un &s;o often ri&s;e and &s;et! yonder is the grove where I repo&s;ed at noon; and that is the hill where I mu&s;ed at eve. In yon man&s;ion, I fir&s;t drew the breath of Heaven; and there perhaps Ar|davan may yet be weeping for my departure."</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030671_0006_0FE85B4606E63088">The gentle heart of Solyman thus indulged it&s;elf a while, till the declining day called upon him to pro|ceed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN he had reached the foot of Taurus, the &s;hadows of evening fell from the moun|tains; he, therefore, &s;ought to repo&s;e him&s;elf in the village of Abdat: but as he was advancing towards it, he was &s;topped by the exclamation of &s;orrow, that proceeded from an adjacent wood. As he was in hopes of relieving &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, he &s;crupled not to draw near enough to li&s;ten; and &s;oon di&s;covered, that the per&s;ons he heard &s;peaking, were two lovers, who had &s;tolen a &s;ecret interview, before their final &s;epara|tion.</P>
<P>The heart of Solyman had never felt the pa&s;&s;ion of love; and he was therefore the more curious to &s;ee the effects of it. But how great was his a&s;toni&s;hment, when, as he approached the place from whence the voices came he beheld the lover lying in all the ago|nies of &s;orrow, at the feet of his weeping mi&s;tre&s;s! "Immortal Power!" &s;aid he, "I have been told that love was the be&s;t of thy gifts; is this mi&s;erable, this painful &s;ight, a proof of it? Behold that wretched youth, how his heart labors and &s;truggles under its oppre&s;&s;ion; while the amiable maiden, who &s;eems to be the cau&s;e of his mi&s;ery, hangs over him in tears and &s;ilence, as if incapable of relieving him! Heav|ens, what agonies! Rea&s;on will be driven from her &s;eat. Ha! nature gives place; he faints!"</P>
<P>Solyman, perceiving his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was now become nece&s;&s;ary, ru&s;hed into the thicket, and rai&s;ed the un|happy lover from the earth. At length his &s;en&s;es re|turned; but his grief, which had before been &s;o ex|qui&s;itely violent, was changed into gloomy &s;tupidity.&mdash; Solyman, however, by the &s;oothing &s;ounds of pity,
<PB N="8" REF="030671_0007_0FE85B4D103114A0">
awoke his attention, and by gentle importunity drew from him the cau&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Stranger," &s;aid the youth, "whoever thou art thine appearance entitles thee to regard, and the com|pa&s;&s;ion thou ha&s;t &s;hown me merits my confidence. Thou now beholde&s;t the mo&s;t unhappy of men. That lady, at who&s;e feet I &s;o lately lay in&s;en&s;ible, is the daughter of a mercenary wretch, who has &s;old her to the Khan of Bukharia: and to-morrow &s;he is to be conveyed to him without expo&s;tulation or reprieve."</P>
<P>"What!" replied Solyman, "is it po&s;&s;ible that any thing can induce a parent to make his child mi&s;erable! I was not ignorant of the depravity of man; but I thought the affections of nature could not have been overcome. Yet, if it is &s;o, can there be any obliga|tion on the child to take the portion of mi&s;ery that her parent holds out to her? The obligation of chil|dren to parents, can only be founded in gratitude; and where no favor is &s;hown, no gratitude can be due. It is impo&s;&s;ible that, in any circum&s;tances, you &s;hould be more mi&s;erable; but it is very po&s;&s;ible, that you may be happier. Fly, while the moments of liberty remain: and let not tho&s;e hearts which Heaven has formed for each other, be &s;eparated by man. The roof of Ardavan has always been a refuge to inno|cence in di&s;tre&s;s; I will my&s;elf conduct you to the valley of Irwan, where my father's venerable charac|ter, and the retired &s;ituation of his abode, will &s;ecure you from detection; and I &s;hall rejoice to be the means of delivering you from mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>This offer was too intere&s;ting to be refu&s;ed. The lovers put them&s;elves under the conduct of Solyman; and he now repa&s;&s;ed the roads he had travelled by the light of the &s;un, with &s;uperior plea&s;ure, even in the gloom of night; &s;o delightful is beneficence to a vir|tuous mind!</P>
<P>When the morning began to appear they had reach|ed the banks of the Tigris. "It will not be nece&s;&s;a|ry," &s;aid &s;olyman, "that I &s;hould attend you farther:
<PB N="9" REF="030671_0008_0FE85B4E9A74C038">
yonder is the valley of Irwan, and the hou&s;e of Arda|van. To know that you are unhappy, will be a &s;uf|ficient motive for him to receive you; and your &s;tory will procure you his protection. I will now take leave of you, becau&s;e I would not again take leave of my father. Tell him that I recommend you to his care; he will rejoice to hear that Solyman has been the means of your happine&s;s; but tell him not, that I re|turned to the banks of the Tigris." Having thus parted with the lovers, he proceeded on his journey, and in five days arrived at I&s;pahan.</P>
<P>The beauty and magnificence of that exten&s;ive city engaged his attention for many days: he was now a&s;|toni&s;hed at the &s;tupendous effects of indu&s;try, and now delighted by the elegance of art. But by the&s;e he thought him&s;elf rather amu&s;ed than in&s;tructed: and he perceived that day after day departed from him, without being di&s;tingui&s;hed either by the acqui&s;ition of knowledge or the practice of virtue; he, therefore frequented the places of public re&s;ort, and endeavor|ed to form &s;uch connections as were mo&s;t likely to pro|mote both.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e who&s;e conver&s;ation he found mo&s;t in&s;tructing and entertaining, he was par|ticularly fond of an Engli&s;h merchant, who had re&s;i|ded &s;ome time at I&s;pahan, and &s;poke the language of the country: the merchant al&s;o perceiving in Soly|man a &s;uperior under&s;tanding, and a benevolent heart, was delighted with his company, and cultivated his friend&s;hip. They frequently met; and their conver|&s;ation generally turning on the manners and pur&s;uits of men, they mutually gratified each other by accounts of their different countries.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="030671_0009_0FE85B558D5A7118">"You," &s;aid Solyman, "have enjoyed the advan|tages which I am &s;till to procure. You have &s;een many different parts of the world, and can form a collective idea of its inhabitants: your commercial engagements mu&s;t have led you much into the inter|e&s;ts and de&s;igns of men; and you mu&s;t con&s;equently be well acquainted with the prevailing propen&s;ities of the heart. But I &s;hould be particularly obliged to you for an account of your own country, of which I have yet had but an imperfect de&s;cription."</P>
<P>"The difference of men," &s;aid the merchant, "lies only in their complexion and manners: their princi|ples are the &s;ame, in all ages, and in all climates; and &s;elf-intere&s;t is the prevailing principle from Indus to the Thames. I am not however &s;uch a &s;chool phi|lo&s;opher, as to think the whole human &s;pecies &s;hould come under this conclu&s;ion: I have experienced the delights of friend&s;hip, and the con&s;olations of benev|olence, where intere&s;t was no motive; I have even known many, who have contributed to remove the mi&s;eries of their fellow creatures, though by the dim|inution of their own fortune.&mdash;That excellent, that truly u&s;eful &s;pirit of munificence, in a particular man|ner characterizes my countrymen. Were you, my friend, in the metropolis of Great Britain, you would behold &s;pacious edifices erected for helple&s;s in|digence; and find the &s;ame &s;kill and care employed for the health and the lives of the poor, that the mo&s;t affluent circum&s;tances can procure for the rich."</P>
<P>"But munificence is not the only ornament that di&s;tingui&s;hes my country: there, too, dwell liberty and ju&s;tice; liberty, that, however &s;trange it may &s;eem to you, delights in the protection of a monarch; and ju&s;tice, which he cau&s;es to be admini&s;tered without partiality. The greate&s;t ba&s;&s;a in Great Britain can|not invade either the life or the property of the mean|e&s;t &s;ubject with impunity; he is equally obnoxious to the laws, and would &s;uffer indi&s;criminately with the mo&s;t ob&s;cure malefactor.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030671_0010_0FE85B5718E38D30">"This general &s;ecurity of property and life excites an unwearied &s;pirit of indu&s;try, and di&s;per&s;es the &s;ons of commerce over the remote&s;t regions of the earth. Hence, my friend, we vi&s;it the towers of I&s;pahan, and the gulphs of Ba&s;&s;ora; our &s;ails are &s;tretched from the mo&s;t di&s;tant i&s;lands of the Atlantic to the &s;hores of Japan: and London is &s;upplied with all the luxu|ries of nature, and all the labors of art."</P>
<P>"You give me," &s;aid Solyman, "a very magnifi|cent, and a very plea&s;ing idea of your country. But will not commerce, as it enriches the people, corrupt their manners. Will unbounded affluence produce neither riot nor debauchery, vanity nor pride? The inhabitants of Great Britain may be more &s;plendid and luxurious; but the dwellers in Me&s;opotamia are, perhaps, happier, in proportion as they are more inno|cent: for Ardavan my father, has frequently told me, that wealth corrupts the heart of man."</P>
<P>"All the good things of life," an&s;wered the mer|chant, "are complicated with evils. If wealth be not de&s;irable becau&s;e it may lead us into luxury, or inflame us with pride; no more would the &s;anguine cheerfulne&s;s of health, le&s;t it &s;hould betray us into li|centiou&s;ne&s;s. There are, it is to be feared, many who&s;e manners are depraved by riches, but, there are, like|wi&s;e, many who employ them in the diffu&s;ion of knowl|edge, or the relief of indigence.</P>
<P>"The&s;e," &s;aid Solyman, "are glorious ends, and would almo&s;t excite me to turn merchant, for the ac|qui&s;ition of wealth. But give me &s;ome account of the literature of your country."</P>
<P>"Of that," replied the merchant, "I am &s;carce a competent judge, the greate&s;t part of my time having been employed in commercial &s;tudies. I am not, however, wholly unacquainted with it; for I have al|ways thought, that a merchant &s;hould not neglect the accompli&s;hments of a gentleman. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of literature in Great Britain will be &s;een be&s;t by con|&s;idering the performances of the learned in their re&s;|pective
<PB N="12" REF="030671_0011_0FE85C1485995980">
cla&s;&s;es. We have but few hi&s;torians of real merit; either their &s;tyle is &s;lovenly and unharmonious, or their matter undige&s;ted and confu&s;ed; they are ei|ther the tools of a faction, or the &s;laves of a book&s;eller. But I have had the plea&s;ure of hearing, &s;ince I came to I&s;pahan, that the hi&s;tories of England and Scotland, the two divi&s;ions of Great Britain, have lately been written with con&s;iderable &s;pirit, accuracy, and ele|gance. As to the hi&s;tories of other countries, which have been publi&s;hed in Great Britian, they are &s;uch mere compilations that they de&s;erve not to be called the labors of art."</P>
<P>"From this account of your hi&s;torians," &s;aid Soly|man, "I cannot entertain any great idea of them; but what are your orators?"&mdash;"As to rhetorical wri|ting," an&s;wered the merchant, we have many that are truly excellent; &s;pirited and elevated in &s;entiment, in language harmonious and correct: but the powers of compo&s;ition are rendered inefficacious by a &s;piritle&s;s pronunciation. The art of public &s;peaking, however important in it&s;elf, &s;eems entirely to be neglected; and the orator pronounces his di&s;cour&s;e from the ro&s;trum with as little feeling him&s;elf, and as little influence up|on his audience, as if he were reading the new&s;paper of the day."&mdash;"Then I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid Solyman, "that your orators &s;peak on unaffecting, or unintere&s;ting &s;ubjects." "That is not the ca&s;e," replied the mer|chant; "the &s;ubjects they treat are of the la&s;t import|ance: the duties we owe the Supreme Being, the di&s;|pen&s;ations of his providence, the eternal obligations of morality, the charms of virtue, and the delightful exer|ci&s;es of ju&s;tice, mercy, and charity."&mdash;"Holy Mithra!" interrupted Solyman, "can the &s;peakers be unaffected while they are treating the&s;e &s;ubjects? Do they then think them of that importance they really are; or do your teachers di&s;believe and di&s;regard their own doc|trines; or are they unconcerned what effect they may have upon the people?" "It would be uncharitable," &s;aid the merchant, "to admit generally any of the&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="030671_0012_0FE85C161205B560">
&s;uppo&s;itions. Their unanimated and unawakening manner of &s;peaking may proceed from innocent cau&s;|es, which tho&s;e you mention are not."</P>
<P>"I take it for granted," &s;aid Solyman, "that as you have orators, at lea&s;t in point of compo&s;ition, you have al&s;o poets; for rhetoric and poetry are nearly allied. Be&s;ides I have been informed that every country has its poets; and that even on the frozen mountains of the north, the hardy inh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">tants open their mouths to &s;ing." "The love of harmony," replied the mer|chant, "is in man a natural pa&s;&s;ion. There is &s;ome|thing metrical and numerous in his motions, his ac|tions, and his words, and he has always endeavored to reduce the la&s;t to a kind of poetical mea&s;ure, even where the art of writing was unknown or unpracti&s;ed. The art of poetry in Great Britain, has of late years been brought to great perfection; the language of the country is both nervous and harmonious, and cal|culated to expre&s;s the tender and the &s;ublime, in both which &s;pecies of writing we have poets that have nev|er been excelled. Though the Engli&s;h are, in gener|al, of a le&s;s &s;prightly turn than their neighbors the French; yet, in the active powers of imagination, in the flights of fancy, and the &s;trains of humor, their writings are by no means inferior. Hence the Engli&s;h poetry is not only harmonious, but &s;entimental and picture&s;que, abounding with &s;trong images and lively de&s;criptions. In &s;hort, my countrymen have attempt|ed every different &s;pecies of poetry, and have excelled in each."</P>
<P>"The account you give me of your poetry," &s;aid Solyman, "makes me very de&s;irous to learn your lan|guage. There is no &s;pecies of writing that gives me equal plea&s;ure: I caught the enthu&s;ia&s;m from nature, from the harmony and &s;ymmetry of her works. If you who have &s;o long been accu&s;tomed to the elegance of the Engli&s;h, can bear a &s;pecimen of the Me&s;opota|mian poetry, I will repeat you a performance of my own."</P>

<P>IN &s;ocial intercour&s;e the merchant pa&s;&s;ed many days with Solyman, and while he gratified his curio&s;ity, engaged his affection. Being &s;uddenly cal|led by bu&s;ine&s;s to the court of Ba&s;&s;ora, he came one

morning to take a final leave; but the traveller was too much attached to his friend, to &s;uffer any thing but nece&s;&s;ity to part them. "Permit me," &s;aid he, "to at|tend you on your pre&s;ent expedition. I have not ap|pointed to my&s;elf any particular rout, but travel as occa&s;ion or inclination leads me; I am &s;en&s;ible I &s;hall gain more from your experience and ob&s;ervation, than I can from my own." This offer was too agreeable to the merchant, not to be eagerly embraced; and, after the nece&s;&s;ary preparations, they &s;et out from I&s;|pahan, and met the morning on the mountains of Arvan.</P>
<P>The &s;un appeared above the horizon, and Solyman pro&s;trated him&s;elf in the profounde&s;t adoration. When he aro&s;e from his devotions, he advanced to|wards his fellow traveller, with a look of kindne&s;s mixed with pity and concern. The merchant under|&s;tood him: but as he was unwilling to controvert the principles of his religion, he made no apology for his conduct during the devotions of Solyman.</P>
<P>The mild morning light which was diffu&s;ed over the vallies and &s;treams, the various beauty of the meadows, the regular di&s;po&s;ition of blo&s;&s;omed hedge|rows, the &s;oothing murmurs of bees at their early la|bor, and the full concert of the feathered creation, drew their conver&s;ation on the univer&s;al beneficence of nature. "I feel," &s;aid Solyman, a delight, which I can neither account for nor de&s;cribe. The&s;e moun|tains gilded with the rays of the orient &s;un, tho&s;e paint|ed vallies that &s;hame the rich carpets of Per&s;ia, yon di&s;tant waters which gleam with the &s;hifting effulgence of light, the general bu&s;y voice of joy and activity in the animal creation, con&s;pire to fill my heart with in|expre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"That plea&s;ure," replied the merchant, "I believe, proceeds from &s;ympathy: it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s you have &s;ome peculiar cau&s;e of mi&s;ery, not to be plea&s;ed when you &s;ee every thing around you happy. On the contrary, if you go into the man&s;ions of &s;or|row, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand the infection of

it. The God of nature &s;eems to have given us the&s;e &s;ympathetic feelings, to link our affections in the great chain of &s;ociety: hence, &s;ocial virtue is not left to de|pend &s;olely no the moral will, but is founded on the principles of our nature.</P>
<P>But the object of your adoration is &s;o profu&s;e of his favors, that I &s;hould now be glad to find &s;ome conveni|ent &s;hade. I think, I di&s;cover a cave on the &s;outhern declivity of the mountain; let us retire to it during the heat of the day."</P>
<P>As they were advancing towards the cave, they per|ceived a beaten path leading directly from it to a di&s;|tant rivulet: this made them apprehen&s;ive that it might be the habitation of &s;ome wild bea&s;t, that had worn the path by con&s;tantly going to drink at the &s;tream: but their fears were &s;oon removed upon the appearance of an aged hermit, advancing &s;lowly to|wards the rivulet with an earthen pitcher. At &s;ight of the travellers, he ha&s;ted to his abode with all the feeble precipitancy of age; they agrees not to di&s;|turb him, and only took advantage of the rock which projected over his cell to &s;helter them&s;elves from the &s;un; but they had not long continued in this &s;itua|tion, before the hermit, perceiving them to be inoffen|&s;ive travellers invited them into his cave.</P>
<P>"You will excu&s;e," &s;aid the hoary &s;age, "the cau|tion of years: these mountains are not &s;ecure from the ravage of human ferocity; and these grey hairs would be no defence from the wanton cruelty of man. I have &s;uffered &s;o much from my own &s;pecies, that I have at la&s;t for&s;aken their &s;ociety: I thought it better to give up the convenience of it, than to bear the evils; and I have long lived in this &s;olitary cave on nothing more than what uncultivated nature would afford me."&mdash;"Tho&s;e &s;ufferings," &s;aid Solyman, "mu&s;t, indeed, have been extraordinary, that could make you give up one of the greate&s;t advantages of life, the &s;ocial intercour&s;e of your fellow creatures."&mdash; "The narratives of age," replied the hermit, "are

&s;eldom agreeable to youth; but as in&s;truction can be gained only from experience, you will do wi&s;ely to learn it from the misfortunes of Abbas.</P>
<P>I was born to a competent fortune in the prov|ince of Lure&s;tan: but being early left an orphan, my affairs came under the cognizance of a ju&s;ticiary court, which the members of it call the court of equity; but &s;o equitable were they with regard to me, that they claimed two parts of my little fortune for their care of the third."&mdash;"Would to God, that were never the ca&s;e in Great Britain!" interrupted the merchant. "But proceed." Though I had &s;uch in early and convincing proof of the treachery and rapacity of mankind; yet, as I had always exerci&s;ed the benevo|lent virtues my&s;elf, I could not think others totally devoid of them; and at my three and twentieth year being inclined to travel, I without &s;cruple entru&s;ted the remains of my fortune with a per&s;on whom I had long known and re&s;pected; a per&s;on, Holy Allah! who lifted his hands to thee; but I had not been ab|&s;ent from Lure&s;tan more than three moons, when he pretended a commi&s;&s;ion to di&s;po&s;e of my effects, and immediately left the place. Upon my return there|fore to the province, I found neither friend nor for|tune; and being bred to no bu&s;ine&s;s, I was reduced to the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of indigence. I applied, however, not without hopes of redre&s;s or relief, to a per&s;on of power and eminence, whom I had often heard &s;peak of his friend&s;hip with my father. After long and frequent attendance, I was admitted to an interview: I laid open my di&s;tre&s;s to him with that kind of eloquence which the mi&s;eries we &s;uffer from the treachery of others always &s;ugge&s;ts; and which however unaffected it may be to indifferent per&s;ons, utters its complaints with dignity and re&s;entment. I was heard half way through my &s;tory, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the following reply: "It is not nece&s;&s;ary, young man, to proceed with your complaints; I perceive you have been abu&s;ed, and I am &s;orry for you; But
<PB N="18" REF="030671_0017_0FE85B5FA89E1240">
that &s;hall not be the only proof of my regard for you; I will give you a little advice: you &s;hould never de|pend &s;o much on the benevolence or integrity of any human being, as to tru&s;t him with your fortune or your life." Thus ended my hopes from the friend of my father; who&s;e benevolence extended no farther, than to in&s;truct me how to &s;ecure the fortune that was &s;tolen, and to pre&s;erve the life which I wi&s;hed to loo&s;e.</P>
<P>I had now no choice, but to enter as a common &s;ol|dier, into the army of the Sophia. I had always de|lighted in martial exerci&s;es, and was expert in the u&s;e of arms; my dexterity and addre&s;s drew upon me the attention of my officers; and in a &s;hort time obtained a &s;mall commi&s;&s;ion. I had now almo&s;t forgotten my mi&s;eries, and embraced my new &s;ituation with cheer|fulne&s;s and hope; but Fortune, who had for a while cea&s;ed to per&s;ecute me as below her notice, as if &s;he had been indignant at my &s;atisfaction, and jealous of my pro&s;pects, now renewed and redoubled her &s;everity.</P>
<P>"My commanding officer had a daughter of extra|ordinary beauty, and an uncommon capacity. Zara was the object of univer&s;al admiration: but &s;he had &s;et her heart on the unfortunate Abbas. The fir&s;t moment I beheld her, I di&s;covered in her looks the mo&s;t tender and affectionate regard for me, which I imputed to her compa&s;&s;ion for my misfortunes; though at the &s;ame time I wi&s;hed, not knowing why, that it might proceed from another cau&s;e.&mdash;She a&s;ked me for the &s;tory of my life: I told it in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t pathetic manner; yet, when I had fini&s;hed &s;he de&s;ired me to repeat it. From this moment I had done with peace; her infectious tenderne&s;s had &s;uch an influence upon my heart, that I could think of nothing but Za|ra; without Zara I was mi&s;erable. A thou&s;and times did I flatter my&s;elf, that there was &s;omething more than mere compa&s;&s;ion in her look and manner; and not many days had pa&s;&s;ed, before I was convinced of the dear fatal truth from this letter&mdash;</P>

<P>"The emotions I felt on the receipt of this letter can only be conceived by tho&s;e who, in the mid&s;t of de&s;pairing love, have beheld a gleam of hope. The tumult of my heart hurried me to the place appointed, long before the time: I walked backward and forward in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, totally regardle&s;s of every ob|ject about me; &s;ometimes rai&s;ing my hands and eyes in the &s;udden effu&s;ions of tran&s;port, and &s;ometimes &s;miling with the complacency of delight.</P>
<P>At length the day departed, and Zara came. My heart bounded at her &s;ight: I was unable to &s;peak, and threw my&s;elf at her feet. She was alarmed at my exce&s;&s;ive earne&s;tne&s;s and confu&s;ion; but commad|ing me to ri&s;e," "Abbas" &s;aid &s;he, "if your confu&s;ion proceed from your mode&s;t gratitude, re&s;train it, till you find whether I am able to &s;erve you; if it ari&s;es from any other cau&s;e, I mu&s;t leave you this moment." I entreated &s;he would tell me, to what I was indebted for the happine&s;s of this interview, and I would be calm and attentive. "My regard for your merit, and my compa&s;&s;ion for your &s;ufferings," &s;aid &s;he, "make me wi&s;h to &s;erve you. Tell me, Abbas, can I a&s;&s;i&s;t you through the intere&s;t of my father?" I faltered out my acknowledgments: telling her, that to her I mu&s;t owe all my hopes of future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>She left me immediately without reply. The &s;in|gularity of my behavior on the parade before the coming of Zara, had drawn upon me the attention of an officer who was &s;ecretly her admirer, and who, ei|ther through curio&s;ity, or &s;u&s;picion, though unob&s;erv|ed

<P>ZARA, ignorant of what had pa&s;&s;ed, with her u&s;ual freedom and good nature, began to ex|pre&s;s her compa&s;&s;ion for the misfortunes of Abbas, talked of his merits, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee him preferred. The old general, who was naturally jealous and im|petuous, exclaimed with a bur&s;t of indignation, "Yes, I &s;hall prefer him!" Early the next morning he &s;ent my di&s;charge; and while I was gazing in &s;tupid a&s;|toni&s;hment upon my general's letter, a youth, ma&s;ked brought me a &s;mall ca&s;ket, with a letter from Zara, which to the be&s;t of my remembrance, was as fol|lows:"</P>

<P><PB N="21" REF="030671_0020_0FE85C2EE9D45FC0">"In the angui&s;h and confu&s;ion of my heart, I fol|lowed my guide without knowing whither he was leading me, or what I was about to do. I vented my grief in broken ejaculations, frequently calling upon the name of Zara, but not once addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to my attendant. By the evening of the &s;econd day, we had advanced forty miles &s;outhward from the prov|ince of Lure&s;tan; when&mdash;how &s;hall I relate the la&s;t horrid &s;cene of my mi&s;eries!&mdash;pardon me! the&s;e aged eyes have yet a tear left, yet a tear for the memory of Zara!&mdash;we were attacked by a band of robbers. My guide was Zara! in her fright &s;he threw off her ma&s;k, and cried "Zara!" Love, rage, fear and vengeance, gave me &s;upernatural &s;trength: three of the villians fell by my &s;abre; a fourth di&s;armed me; and the re&s;t of the gang carried off Zara."</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is of his &s;tory, the &s;pirits of the aged hermit were exhau&s;ted by their own violence; and it was &s;ome time before he could proceed.</P>
<P>"You have now" continued he, "heard the com|pletion of my misfortunes.

<P>Deprived of hope, and dejected with melancholy, I could no longer bear the &s;ociety of mankind: I therefore betook my&s;elf to the&s;e &s;olitary mountains, where this cell has been my habitation for years, that have pa&s;&s;ed away in unvaried &s;orrow; and where you are the fir&s;t of human beings that have heard me tell my tale."</P>

<P>SOLYMAN expatiated on the &s;ufferings of Abbas with the mo&s;t tender &s;en&s;ibility, and inveighed again&s;t the ba&s;ene&s;s of mankind with all the rage of hone&s;t re&s;entment. "Surely," &s;aid he to the merchant "man is the vile&s;t of all creatures! in proportion as he excels them in rea&s;on, he exceeds them in the ability to do mi&s;chief; and being equally cruel, the mi&s;chief he does renders him more dete&s;table. Sacred Mithra! why do&s;t thou lend thy light to the villain and the ty|rant? Were it not for the enjoyment of your com|pany, my friend, I &s;hould have few inducements to go farther from the valley of Irwan; for po&s;&s;ibly to &s;ee more of human life, is only to know more of its crimes and mi&s;eries."</P>
<P>"From the complicated di&s;tre&s;&s;es of one per&s;on," replied the merchant, "you draw a partial image of the life of man. But the day declines: let us ha&s;ten over the&s;e mountains, that we may repo&s;e at night in &s;ome village of the valley." The travellers took leave of the hermit; and about the clo&s;e of day arrived at the village of Arden.</P>
<P>At their entrance they were met by a per&s;on of a plain dre&s;s, and a cheerful countenance, who without ceremony, invited them, as travellers, to partake of his hou&s;e and table that night. They accepted his in|vitation; and the merchant, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to So|lyman, &s;aid, "From the family of this man, you &s;hall not only be convinced, that there is both happine&s;s and virtue in human life; but you &s;hall &s;ee al&s;o, how much the former depends upon the latter, I have been entertained by him, in travelling this way before: he is never more happy than when he has an opportunity of gratifying his benevolence. His inheritance being much le&s;&s;ened by the lo&s;&s;es of his father, who was a merchant, he has but little wealth, except what ari&s;es from the indu&s;trious cultivation of a farm, which he purcha&s;ed ten years ago with the chief part of his

fortune; yet he is as liberal to the poor and the &s;tran|ger, as if he had large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; his known ho&s;pi|tality and genero&s;ity make his hou&s;e the re&s;ort of the traveller and the indigent; and after he has fini&s;hed the labors of the day, he is always ready to entertain the one, and relieve the other; hence that &s;erene and ea&s;y cheerfulne&s;s which you &s;ee in his countenance. In his family you behold the influence of a good ex|ample; his wife, whom he loves, and by whom he is beloved with the mo&s;t cordial &s;incerity, goes hand in hand with him, not only through their mutual cares, but al&s;o in the exerci&s;es of benevolence. It is the principle of her economy, that dome&s;tic frugality is the &s;upport of liberality; and &s;he di&s;pen&s;es her own, and her hu&s;bands bounties, with that propriety and ea&s;y cheerfulne&s;s, which double their value to the re|ceiver.

<P>WHEN the dawn of the morning broke, Solyman and the merchant, with the mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments of the ho&s;pitality with which they had been entertained, left the village of Arden, fol|lowed by the kind wi&s;hes of their ho&s;t, and his amia|ble family. They travelled for &s;ome days through the &s;outhern provinces of Per&s;ia, without any remark|able occurrences, or any other entertainment, than &s;uch as could be found in the diver&s;ity of pro&s;pects, and the different labors of men. Sometimes they a|mu&s;ed them&s;elves with the contemplation of tho&s;e places, which hi&s;tory had marked out as the &s;cenes of great events; and &s;ometimes had occa&s;ion to reflect on the peri&s;hable monuments of human magnificence.</P>
<P>The noble plain on which &s;tood the once glorious Per&s;epolis afforded them inexhau&s;tible matter of curi|o&s;ity and meditation: this plain extending about nine|teen leagues, abounds every where with villages, and is watered by the great river Araxes. Nature has been &s;o indu&s;trious in the defence of it, that &s;he has rai&s;ed before it mountains, that bear all the appear|ance, and might an&s;wer the end of artificial fortifica|tions. From hence the travellers were amu&s;ed with the ruinous remains of many noble edifices, that had once adorned the range of mountains: but when they were come to that part of them which covered the an|cient palace of Per&s;epolis, the &s;tupendous ruin &s;truck them with &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment. Porticoes, which had with&s;tood the a&s;&s;aults of time more than two thou&s;and years; broken columns of different lengths, ri&s;ing at con&s;iderable di&s;tances within the limits of the &s;ame pile; &s;culptured portals, through who&s;e frowning ar|ches the winds pa&s;s with a hollow murmuring; num|berle&s;s figures engraven on the pila&s;ters of tho&s;e port|als; and multitudes of hieroglyphics on the different parts of the &s;pacious ruin; gave the travellers a
<PB N="26" REF="030671_0025_0FE85B6F472963A8">
mournful and magnificent idea of the pri&s;tine grand|eur of this edifice,</P>
<P>The merchant ob&s;erving Solyman to be totally ab|&s;orbed in thought, would not interrupt the melancholy plea&s;ure of his contemplations; but waited, in &s;ilence, till, with an air of unaffected concern, he thus expre&s;|&s;ed his &s;entiments on Per&s;epolis.</P>
<P>"I am at a lo&s;s, my friend, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e magnificent ruins, whether I &s;hould think more high|ly or more meanly of mankind. Pride rai&s;ed this lof|ty edifice, and pride de&s;troyed it.&mdash;The vanity of a Cyrus, a Darius, or a Xerxes, adorned tho&s;e &s;uperb columns; and the vanity of an Alexander defaced them. The&s;e domes were not reared &s;olely for regal magnificence and &s;ecurity, but to aid the appetites of poverty and luxury, and to &s;ecrete the royal plea&s;ures from tho&s;e that toiled to gratify them. Thus, as this noble &s;tructure was po&s;&s;ibly rai&s;ed not only for vanity but for riot; &s;o, probably, by vanity inflamed by riot, it fell: probably at the reque&s;t of a &s;miling harlot, the towers of Per&s;epolis blazed for her diver&s;ion; probably, becau&s;e the conqueror had taken too large a draught of wine, this palace, the glory of ea&s;tern art, &s;unk to the ground: a &s;triking in&s;tance of the vanity of human labors, and the depravity of human nature! on the other hand, while I con&s;ider the work of the arti&s;t; while I am delighted with the &s;ymme|try and proportion, which is yet to be traced through the&s;e maimed ruins, and &s;truck with the bold relief of the ancient Per&s;ian achitecture; I forget the motives both of the erection and demolition of Per&s;epolis; and admire the indu&s;try and ingenuity of man, that gave &s;uch grace and beauty to the&s;e ma&s;&s;y &s;tructures."</P>
<P>"Your &s;entiments," &s;aid the merchant, "are much the &s;ame with my own, but give me leave now to con|duct you to a mountain, about two leagues di&s;tant from the&s;e ruins, and &s;ituated between two of the mo&s;t beautiful plains in the world. This mountain con&s;i&s;ts of one entire rock, capable of the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite
<PB N="27" REF="030671_0026_0FE85B70D17D8A00">
poli&s;h: it is reduced to form by art, and its &s;ides are perpendicular; &s;o that, at a di&s;tance, it has the appearance of a wall. Upon this rock are &s;everal pieces of ba&s;s relief, exqui&s;itely performed; in one of which is repre&s;ented a combat between the king of Per&s;ia, and the king of the Indies; the latter of whom, according to the tradition of the times, was &s;ubdued. There are be&s;ides many other figures, of which, though you may not di&s;cover the de&s;ign, you will be plea&s;ed with the execution."</P>
<P>Solyman proceeded with his friend to the mountain, much delighted, as well with the extraordinary appear|ance of the rock, as the uncommon beauty of the plains that were &s;pread on either hand beneath, inter|&s;per&s;ed with villas &s;haded by trees&punc; exten&s;ive meadows, and pa&s;tures filled with flocks. When they had grat|ified their curio&s;ity, and indulged their &s;peculations, they proceeded on their journey, and in a &s;hort time arrived at the Gulf of Ba&s;&s;ora.</P>
<P>The merchant, having here found the ve&s;&s;el he ex|pected, told Solyman, that if his inclination led him to Europe, he could accommodate him with a convenient pa&s;&s;age; informing him, at the &s;ame time, that his own affairs would detain him &s;ome years longer in Per&s;ia. Solyman, who&s;e heart was firmly attached to the mer|chant, long he&s;itated between friend&s;hip and curio&s;ity: however, as he mu&s;t have parted with him had he con|tinued his travels in A&s;ia, and was not totally without hopes of &s;eeing him in what he called the new world, he determined to accept his offer.</P>

<P>AS the &s;hip was to remain &s;ome time in the gulf, Solyman took the opportunity to make the tour of India. In his way he vi&s;ited the I&s;le of Ormus, than which no part of nature wears a more

di&s;mal appearance. Excepting a few hou&s;es, which make the capital of the place, the whole looks like a heath bla&s;ted by lightning, or burnt up by de&s;ign. Yet here, in this &s;cene of dreary de&s;olation, Solyman had the mortification to meet with an exile from the city of I&s;pahan.</P>
<P>"Surely," &s;aid he to the unhappy man, "you mu&s;t have been &s;o unfortunate as to commit &s;ome enormous crime, condemned as you are to this mi&s;erable abode?"</P>
<P>"Stranger," replied the exile, "I have been unfor|tunate, but not unju&s;t. One day, being at the Per&s;ian court, I told a gentleman who &s;tood near me in a low whi&s;per, that I thought the Sultana Moratte extremely beautiful.&mdash;This was my crime! and it was the de|cree of imperial ju&s;tice, that for this I &s;hould wear out the remains of life in this dreary &s;olitude,"</P>
<P>"Heavens!" &s;aid Solyman, "what madne&s;s mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s mankind, to lodge unlimited power in the hands of any one human being! when the decrees of ju&s;tice mu&s;t be i&s;&s;ued by numbers united, there are many means of re&s;training partial or illegal &s;entences: &s;elf-intere&s;t, revenge, envy, and every other cau&s;e of per|verting ju&s;tice, would then operate feebly, when oppo&s;|ed by public &s;hame, divided intere&s;ts, and the open appearance of equity. But what comfort can you re|ceive from u&s;ele&s;s declamation? I can help you to the means of deliverance from this wretched pri&s;on; and I think that you are re&s;trained by no principle of du|ty from embracing them; for it is impo&s;&s;ible, that Divine Power &s;hould enforce obedience to the decrees of inju&s;tice. I am now about to travel through In|dia; at my return I will again vi&s;it Ormus and you; and if you &s;hall be inclined to exchange your pri&s;on for the &s;pacious kingdoms of Europe, I will procure you a pa&s;&s;age thither."</P>
<P>The exile heard the&s;e words with inconceivable tran&s;port; he threw him&s;elf at the feet of Solyman, and expre&s;&s;ed his delight in one emphatical word cry|ing out&mdash;"Liberty, liberty!" the plea&s;ure of the trav|eller
<PB N="29" REF="030671_0028_0FE85C406BC50460">
was &s;carce inferior to that of the exile. "Surely," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "the diffu&s;ion of happine&s;s is the highe&s;t bli&s;s that the human heart is capable of! I feel more delight in the hope of defeating the malice of injurious power, than in any thing I have ever met with, either before or &s;ince the beginning of my travels.</P>

<P>SOLYMAN now left Ormus, and proceed|ed towards the frontiers of India. Though the coun|try lies nearly in the &s;ame climate with the &s;outhern provinces of Per&s;ia, yet the a&s;pect of it is different; and it is furni&s;hed with other kinds of plants and an|imals, as well as with people of a different complexion, and different manners: indeed nature &s;eems to have made the intercour&s;e of different nations nece&s;&s;ary, by &s;upplying each with &s;ome peculiar conveniences.</P>
<P>Solyman pa&s;&s;ed not through the provinces of the Mogul's empire without in&s;truction as well as amu&s;e|ment. He was &s;killed in the natural hi&s;tory of plants and animals; and he &s;ound here abundant opportuni|ty to exerci&s;e that kind of knowledge. He was often amu&s;ed by ob&s;erving, how nearly brutal &s;en&s;e borders upon human rea&s;on, in the reflecting &s;agacity of the elephant, and the adroit mi&s;chief of the baboon.</P>
<P>Small, however, in compari&s;on, was the plea&s;ure he received from the natural rarities of India, to that which the excellent admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the &s;everal provinces afforded him.&mdash;The police of that country appeared to him mo&s;t wi&s;ely calculated for the pre&s;ervation of peace and property; the magi&s;|trates that were appointed to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice in their &s;everal di&s;tricts, being obliged to keep per&s;ons contin|ually employed to watch the dealings of commerce, and attend both to public and private tran&s;actions; for the iniquity of which them&s;elves were to be ac|countable,
<PB N="30" REF="030671_0029_0FE85B77B65E4A08">
and the emperor might always be appeal|ed to.</P>
<P>But when he came to Delhi, the capital of the Mo|gal's empire, his opinion of the Indian policy was much altered. He there had the mortification to find a mini&s;try of wives, and a court of concubines, at who&s;e di&s;cretion the principle po&s;ts in the civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hments were u&s;ually di&s;po&s;ed of; and he who was mo&s;t recommended by his per&s;on and ad|dre&s;s, was &s;ure to obtain the highe&s;t office in the leg|i&s;lature or the army. To find that the bands of mu&s;ic at court con&s;i&s;ted only of women, gave him no di&s;|gu&s;t: "There," &s;aid the traveller, "the ladies are in their proper &s;phere. Let them cultivate all the &s;oft and engaging graces: let them employ them&s;elves in the embelli&s;hments of art and the excur&s;ions of fan|cy; but let them not interfere in the important con|cerns of government; nor rai&s;e tho&s;e to the places of power, who&s;e accompli&s;hments are &s;uited only to their ta&s;te."</P>
<P>As Solyman was di&s;plea&s;ed with the caballing arts of the Indian ladies, &s;o he was &s;hocked at their inhu|man and unnatural &s;upe&s;tition. With horror and a|mazement did he &s;ometimes behold a woman, in the bloom of life and beauty, ru&s;h into the flames to ac|company the manes of her dead hu&s;band: and if na|ture &s;huddered at the thought of this dreadful &s;acri|fice, or female &s;oftne&s;s &s;hrunk into fear or irre&s;olution, he beheld a number of diabolical prie&s;ts, with execra|ble &s;creams, and faces of honor, pu&s;hing forward the poor trembling reluctant woman to the burning pile. "Eternal Mithra!" &s;aid the afflicted youth, "what havoc does &s;uper&s;tition make among thy works! when once that fiend enters the human heart, nature and rea&s;on are driven out; their &s;acred lights are wholly extingui&s;hed; truth and humanity are trampled up|on; and the dete&s;ted fury leads her infatuated vota|ries through the horrors of darkne&s;s, into the arms of death!"</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>SOLYMAN was the more affected by this infernal cu&s;tom, as he feared it might one day be the fate of a lady, with whom he had contracted an inti|mate friend&s;hip, and for whom he had the mo&s;t ten|der regard. This amiable per&s;on was a native of Delhi, and her name Almena. As the hou&s;es in which they lodged were contiguous, &s;he fir&s;t drew his atten|tion by her mu&s;ic, which was her favorite employment, and in which &s;he was greatly &s;killed. Solyman had a ta&s;te for all the fine arts; and, after the inquiries and ob&s;ervations of the day, he felt an irre&s;i&s;table plea&s;ure, in li&s;tening, from his portico, to the evening mu&s;ic of Almena. His heart &s;oon became prejudiced in favor of a lady, who had afforded him &s;o much en|tertainment; and he wi&s;hed for nothing more than an opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his gratitude.</P>
<P>It was u&s;ual for Almena to take a morning walk in the &s;uburbs of Delhi. Solyman ob&s;erved this; and in|troduced him&s;elf to her conver&s;ation, by paying his acknowledgments. There is &s;ome &s;ecret attraction in congenial natures, which draws them together, with|out the forms of a long acquaintance. Solyman was &s;oon convinced, that he di&s;covered, in Almena, a di&s;|po&s;ition perfectly &s;uited to his own: her conver&s;ation was the picture of a mind enlarged by virtue, and en|lightened by learning: &s;he had none of the trifling follies or the in&s;ignificant levity of her &s;ex; yet her manner was animated and cheerful: &s;he had no ebul|litions of giddy wit; but her language was the clear and natural image of poli&s;hed &s;en&s;e, and unaffected knowledge. Solyman left no means unattempted to cultivate a friend&s;hip that promi&s;ed &s;o much felicity. He con&s;tantly attended Almena in her morning walk; and, at every interview, entertained &s;ome new &s;enti|ments in her favor. Her heart was not le&s;s benevo|lent than his own: "You have &s;een, my friend," &s;aid &s;he, "almo&s;t every thing in Delhi, that is worth the at|tention
<PB N="32" REF="030671_0031_0FE85B80365DDCA8">
of a &s;tranger; but I &s;uppo&s;e you do not make it your bu&s;ine&s;s, as a traveller, merely to attend to what is uncommon or magnificent; not merely to ex|plore the different operations of nature, and manners of men. Travel mu&s;t afford you many opportunities to relieve the indigent, to comfort the afflicted, to in|form the ignorant, or re&s;cue the oppre&s;&s;ed. Within the compa&s;s of my morning walk, there is a village, the inhabitants of which I call my people; they are all poor; to tho&s;e that are able to labor, I propo&s;e re|wards for the greate&s;t indu&s;try; and tho&s;e who are incapatiated by age or &s;ickne&s;s I take under my own protection."</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive how much Solyman would be delighted with this account of Almena. When he found, that, to all the elegant graces of female &s;oft|ne&s;s, &s;he added the virtues of benevolence, his friend|&s;hip for her was heightened into the mo&s;t refined af|fection. On the other hand, her regard for Solyman increa&s;ed, as &s;he became acquainted with his improved under&s;tanding, and generous temper: for virtue loves her own image, wherever it is found.</P>

<P>SOLYMAN had now pa&s;&s;ed many days at Delhi, in this plea&s;ing intercour&s;e of friend&s;hip; hap|py to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Almena in the diffu&s;ion of happine&s;s, charmed with her virtues, and delighted with her con|ver&s;ation. The time, however, approached, when he was to think of his expedition into Europe; but the friend&s;hip of Almena bound to his heart by &s;tronger ties than that which he had before contracted with the merchant, overbalanced at once every thought of his voyage: he had, therefore, determined to remain at Delhi; when the poor exile at Ormus came into his mind. He &s;tarted at the thought, as he would have
<PB N="33" REF="030671_0032_0FE85B81C5256200">
done at the gho&s;t of Ardavan. "Tis done!" &s;aid he: "Adieu to Almena; adieu to the dear delights of her friend&s;hip, if they mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed at the ex|pence of virtue!"</P>
<P>There is no precept of human wi&s;dom conceived to be of greater u&s;e, and therefore none more frequent|ly urged, than that we &s;hould learn to avoid the evils of life, from the irregularities and misfortunes of oth|ers; yet important as this precept may be, it is, like mo&s;t others, univer&s;ally neglected. We ob&s;erve, in|deed, the events of life; and inquire into their cau&s;es with infatiable curio&s;ity; but we &s;eldom draw any conclu&s;ions for the direction of our own conduct: we hear or read only for amu&s;ement; and the &s;tory pa&s;|&s;es by, without leaving any traces of in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Solyman, who, from the fir&s;t &s;etting out on his trav|els, had received the &s;tronge&s;t convictions of the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of love, without the lea&s;t caution or re&s;i&s;tance &s;uffered that pa&s;&s;ion to make its inroads under the ap|pearance of friend&s;hip; and he now felt all the an|gui&s;h, which he had before been a witne&s;s to, near the village of Abdat. Not once, however, did he he&s;i|tate between love and virtue: the torrent of his grief for the lo&s;s of Almena, violent as it was, could not bear down his determined integrity.</P>
<P>With a heart full of the mo&s;t piercing &s;orrow, he went to take leave of his beloved friend: he re&s;olved, neverthele&s;s, to explain the cau&s;e of his departure with the mo&s;t &s;erene indifference, determined not to af|fect his Almena by the appearance of &s;orrow; he re|&s;olved, and threw him&s;elf at her feet in &s;peechle&s;s an|gui&s;h.</P>
<P>Almena beheld his grief with united &s;orrow and &s;urpri&s;e; and, with tears that flowed from pity and friend&s;hip, entreated him to di&s;cover he cau&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;s. "It is in vain Almena," &s;aid he, "it is in vain any longer to hide my heart from you: nor, in|deed, &s;hould I act the part of friend&s;hip, to di&s;&s;emble its feelings. I, who was ye&s;terday the happie&s;t of

mankind in the enjoyment of your conver&s;ation, am now the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. By the indi&s;pen&s;able laws of honor and humanity, I am called from Delhi: but alas! by the love of Almena, I am induced to &s;tay. I know, my friend, there is no alternative: but that knowledge is my mi&s;ery I go, then, from you and from happine&s;s; perhaps never more to enjoy either; but when I am far from you, it will be &s;ome con&s;ola|tion to believe that you will remember the love and the truth of Solyman."</P>
<P>Almena, as well as the emotions of her heart would give her leave, replied&punc; "Go my friend; go where your virtue leads you, and providence be your guide! Your friend&s;hip while I have life, &s;hall not be forgot|ten: no; Almena &s;hall always re&s;pect your memory, and love you with the &s;ame affection as &s;he does the deare&s;t of her friends."</P>
<P>A flood of tears followed the&s;e words; and Soly|man, unable any longer to behold her &s;orrow, precip|itately withdrew.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>DEPRIVED of that &s;erenity which ever waits on con&s;cious virtue, when free from the great calamities of life, the innocent the once happy Soly|man, was now become the child of affliction. He re|pa&s;&s;ed the provinces of India in deep melancholy, un|affected by every thing that might excite curio&s;ity or exerci&s;e &s;peculation. But, behold the power of virtue! and be convinced, whoever thou art that reade&s;t this &s;tory, that there is nothing equally capable of allevia|ting the afflictions which are incident to human life.</P>
<P>When he arrived at Ormus, and beheld the joy of the poor exile at the &s;ight of his deliverer, he felt a torrent of plea&s;ure in his brea&s;t, overflowing all the oppo&s;itions that grief had rai&s;ed again&s;t it. "O that

Almena," &s;aid he, "were pre&s;ent! that I could com|municate to her the happine&s;s I feel in re&s;cuing this poor Per&s;ian from the oppre&s;&s;ion of tyranny! how would her gentle heart rejoice, and indulge it&s;elf with Solyman in the delights of benevolence! Fate has been &s;evere in dividing tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ouls were made for each other: but it has left me this happine&s;s, and I enjoy it."</P>
<P>Solyman was now about to apply to his friend the merchant, who was &s;till upon the coa&s;t, to procure a pa&s;&s;age for the exile, but he could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of writing immediately to Almena; and from Or|mus he &s;ent the following letter:</P>

<P>AFTER the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of this letter, he went immediately to vi&s;it the merchant, who received him with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip.&mdash;
<PB N="36" REF="030671_0035_0FE84D322AE260D8">
"Welcome," &s;aid he "my valuable friend! who&s;e uncommon virtues have made you devote the plea&s;|urable &s;ea&s;on of life, to the acqui&s;ition of knowledge, and the di&s;tribution of happine&s;s."</P>
<P>"For the latter of the&s;e purpo&s;es," &s;aid Solyman, "I now wait upon you. In the i&s;le of Ormus is an unhappy Per&s;ian, whom the capricious cruelty of his prince has condemned to perpetual exile in that di&s;|mal pri&s;on. Were he a criminal, ju&s;tice &s;hould have its cour&s;e; I might then have beheld him with pity, but &s;hould not have meditated his deliverance; but he is innocent, my friend, he is innocent, and &s;uffers. Cannot you a&s;&s;i&s;t me to effect his e&s;cape? cannot he have that pa&s;&s;age to Europe, which you obligingly offered me?"</P>
<P>"To facilitate the e&s;cape of an exile," replied the merchant, "were as much as my intere&s;t and &s;afety are worth in Per&s;ia. I mu&s;t not be concerned in it; but I will introduce you to the captain of a &s;hip, and engage him to &s;erve you in every thing you &s;hall de|&s;ire: after which if you can take the exile along with you in di&s;gui&s;e, or by any other means, as your friend or attendant, perhaps he may e&s;cape without much difficulty or danger. I have di&s;patched my bu&s;ine&s;s on the coa&s;t, and am obliged to return to I&s;pahan: let us now therefore, if you plea&s;e, wait upon the cap|tain."</P>
<P>Solyman, as he had been in hopes of procuring the exile a pa&s;&s;age without going him&s;elf into Europe, from which the friend&s;hip of Almena had weaned his inclinations, was &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed by this ac|count. However, as he was determined at all events to deliver the poor Per&s;ian, he went immediately to the apartments of the captain, to whom the merchant recommended him as a particular friend who wanted to make the tour of Europe.&mdash;The captain received them with the freedom and cheerfulne&s;s peculiar to his &s;tation, and promi&s;ed Solyman the be&s;t accommo|dation

of his &s;hip; but told him, that &s;he mu&s;t remain there a few months before &s;he could get out of the gulf.</P>
<P>Of this delay, though not an&s;werable to his impa|tient wi&s;hes for the deliverance of the exile, Solyman re&s;olved to make u&s;e, in vi&s;iting his father and the val|ley of Irwan. As &s;oon therefore as he had acquaint|ed the exile with what he had to hope, and advi&s;ed him to provide &s;ecretly for his voyage, and his &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence in a di&s;tant country, he &s;ailed from the gulf up the Euphrates as far as where the Tigris empties it&s;elf into that river, and from thence proceeded by land to the valley of Irwan.</P>

<P>THE venerable Ardavan had a&s;cended an eminence near his hou&s;e, to enjoy the beauties of the &s;ummer evening, and to offer up a prayer to the de|parting &s;un for Solyman, when Solyman appeared be|fore him.</P>
<P>What language can paint the emotions of paternal affection? The feeble remains of aged life twice faint|ed beneath the wait of joy. At length recovering he cried&mdash;"It is enough! Solyman lives! Heaven has regarded the virtues of my &s;on, and re&s;tored him to the arms of Ardavan."</P>
<P>Solyman was not le&s;s affected by this meeting; nor le&s;s delighted to find his aged parent &s;till enjoying health and rea&s;on in the decline of life.

<P>Where are the delights of the valley of Irwan, where the flowery variety of its pa&s;tures and mead|ows, its hills that ro&s;e gradually to meet the morning &s;un, and its groves that &s;pread their foilage to exclude the heats of midday? Wrapt in the gloom, of pen&s;ive &s;olitude, the &s;on of Ardavan was now negligent of the&s;e, and of all that once delighted or amu&s;ed him. In vain did his father de&s;ire a relation of his travels; and in vain did he begin it: when he attempted to &s;peak of Per&s;epolis, he gave a de&s;cription of Delhi; when he was a&s;ked after &s;ome other place, he mention|ed the village of Almena: in&s;tead of de&s;cribing the people of India, he de&s;cribed the per&s;on of Almena; and when an account of their manners was reque&s;ted&mdash; "Her manners," he replied, "are &s;uch as the immor|tal Mithra looks down upon with delight."</P>

<P>ARDAVAN was now no longer at a lo&s;s to account for the gloomy incon&s;i&s;tency of his &s;on's behavior: but willing to be &s;till more convinced of what he &s;u&s;pected to be the cau&s;e, he applied to his pa&s;&s;ions the &s;tory of tho&s;e lovers whom he had rec|ommended to his care. At the mention of the lov|ers, Solyman was rou&s;ed from his melancholy negli|gence, into the mo&s;t eager attention. "Tell me, my father," &s;aid the impatient youth: "tell me, I en|treat you, the fate of the lovers?"</P>
<P>"I thank you," replied the &s;age, "for putting it in my power to a&s;&s;i&s;t the unfortunate. From your com|pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ufferings of the&s;e lovers, and your at|tempt to alleviate them, you will feel more &s;en&s;ibly
<PB N="40" REF="030671_0039_0FE85B9A28B668B8">
the power of the &s;ame con&s;olation, when your own heart becomes a prey to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of love."</P>
<P>Solyman di&s;covered, by his emotions, the effect which this &s;hort preface had upon him.</P>
<P>"You know," continued Ardavan, "a &s;mall build|ing which I erected &s;ome years ago for a retreat in the &s;ummer months; you remember its &s;ituation, in the depth of a &s;pacious wood; which is only acce&s;&s;i|ble by one narrow pa&s;&s;age, to which I have provided a door, &s;o be&s;et with evergreens, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t curious eye to perceive it: the canal of running water in the middle of the wood, and the beautiful gra&s;s-plat I have extended, &s;ince you left me, to the &s;ummer-hou&s;e. To this place I conducted the lovers as &s;oon as I had heard their &s;tory. There they continued for &s;ome time, attended by one of my faith|ful dome&s;tics, who &s;upplied them with every nece&s;&s;a|ry; and they were vi&s;ited almo&s;t every day by my&s;elf. O, my &s;on, how exqui&s;ite was the delight, to behold the happine&s;s of this innocent pair, and at the &s;ame time to con&s;ider my&s;elf as in &s;ome mea&s;ure contribu|ting to it! Surely this was to partake of the plea&s;ure of the Deity, which we believe to con&s;i&s;t in his uni|ver&s;al power of removing evil and di&s;pen&s;ing good!</P>
<P>"After &s;ome time I was informed, that the khan of Bukharia, who had purcha&s;ed the maiden of her father, was depo&s;ed and bani&s;hed by the Sophi. This gave us new hopes; and it was agreed that the youth &s;hould return to Abdat, to learn the di&s;po&s;ition of the unnatural parent. He accordingly went; and told him, that he would endeavor to find his daughter, upon condition that he would con&s;ent to their marriage. The wretch, though he was no &s;tranger to their mu|tual pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;i&s;ted that no man &s;hould ever have his daughter who would not pay the &s;ame price for her which the khan of Bukharia had offered.</P>
<P>"As this price far exceeded the ability of the lover, he returned to Irwan, fallen from tho&s;e plea&s;ing hopes, which he had &s;o lately formed, of enjoying at once
<PB N="41" REF="030671_0040_0FE85B9BB348A980">
his love and his liberty. The father, convinced that his daughter was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the young man, and not now without hopes of recovering her, and of|fering her again to &s;ale, hired a &s;et of ruffians to watch his return, and to extort from him a confe&s;&s;ion of the place where &s;he was &s;ecreted. Of this de&s;ign&punc; however, he was timely appri&s;ed by an hone&s;t villager of Abdat, to whom one of the ruffians had commu|nicated their bu&s;ine&s;s; and he came off in di&s;gui&s;e, and e&s;caped their notice.</P>
<P>"About two months after, it was reported that the father had died of vexation for the di&s;appointment of his avaricious views; I, therefore di&s;patched a &s;ervant to inquire into the truth of this report; and finding it confirmed, conducted the lovers to Abdat without farther apprehen&s;ion. The maiden, who was an only child, inherited her father's fortune, which was very con&s;iderable: but as great part of it had been ama&s;|&s;ed by oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;he made re&s;titution to tho&s;e whom his avarice had injured, and &s;he now enjoys the re|mainder with happine&s;s and her lover."</P>
<P>"What you tell me," &s;aid Solyman, "gives me in|expre&s;&s;ible sati&s;faction: for the lovers are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of eminent virtue; and to be in&s;trumental to the happi|ne&s;s of virtuous lovers, is the mo&s;t delightful ta&s;k within the province of benevolence. Indeed, tho&s;e hearts only that are generous and noble can be capa|ble of the tender &s;en&s;ibility of love: for the brea&s;t which harbors malignity and envy, can never feel the &s;ympathetic tenderne&s;s which is the very e&s;&s;ence of that gentle pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Your ob&s;ervation," replied the &s;age, "may be very ju&s;t; and it is therefore the more nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e to whom nature and the principles of a virtuous education have given the ble&s;&s;ing of an open heart, to guard again&s;t the inroads of that pa&s;&s;ion: if there is no probability of an uninterrupted enjoyment of its object, they &s;hould look upon its advances, as of an evil that will de&s;troy their peace, The plea&s;ures of
<PB N="42" REF="030671_0041_0FE85BA2F3CC5C58">
real-love are, perhaps the mo&s;t refined, the mo&s;t deli|cate and &s;en&s;ible, of any we are capable of enjoying: but believe me, tho&s;e are fortunate lovers, who are in|demnified by the&s;e, for the many unea&s;y hours, the re&s;tle&s;s anxieties, and the painful apprehen&s;ions they undergo."</P>
<P>In the&s;e general terms did Ardavan deliver his in|&s;tructions to his &s;on, who received them with a &s;ilent conviction of their truth and propriety; and imme|diately after this conver&s;ation, retired to offer up the following prayer to the Sun for Almena.</P>
<P>"Incomparable and Everla&s;ting! who&s;e univer&s;al eye &s;ees nothing fairer, nothing more virtuous, than Almena; O let that eye look upon her with the vigi|lence of a parent. She mo&s;t re&s;embles the&s;e in the continual exerci&s;e of beneficence; cheri&s;h, therefore, tho&s;e virtues that are congenial with thy own; and let the dear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, through thy benignant influence, enjoy the con&s;tant ble&s;&s;ings of health and cheerful|ne&s;s: but if &s;ome portion of &s;orrow be the birthright of every human being, immortal Mithra! may Al|mena only &s;igh for the ab&s;ence of her friend!"</P>

<P>IN &s;uch exerci&s;es did Solyman employ his retired hours, till the time approached for his return to Ormus. As he was determined if po&s;&s;ible, to a|void going into Europe, he made no mention of that circum&s;tance to his father: his engagements to the ex|ile were a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his departure&punc; and, in a &s;hort time, he arrived at the gulf, and waited upon the Engli&s;h captain, who was preparing for his voy|age. Solyman informed him, that upon &s;ome inter|e&s;ting occa&s;ion he was obliged to relinqui&s;h his de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Europe; but that he would recommend a Per&s;ian lady to his care, who was bound for England;
<PB N="43" REF="030671_0042_0FE85BA482EC0048">
and he begged that &s;he might enjoy all the retirement her &s;ituation could afford. As no objection was made to this propo&s;al, he privately purcha&s;ed the habit of a Per&s;ian lady, which he concealed &s;ome days on the coa&s;t of Ormus; and, under favor of the night, he found no difficulty to procure a boat to the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el. In a few hours they got under &s;ail; and hav|ing received repeated a&s;&s;urances of the captain's eare, and engaged the good offices of his crew by a hand|&s;ome gratuity, he procured a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea to the coa&s;t of India.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of his heart was now very different from what it had been a few days before: he had di&s;charg|ed his engagements to the exile, with all the &s;ucce&s;s that he could wi&s;h; and his face was now &s;et towards Delhi. On he travelled with the eager pace of a lov|er, and in a few days reached the capital of the Mo|gul's empire.</P>
<P>The evening he arrived, he flew to the hou&s;e of Al|mena, who received him with emotions of tenderne&s;s which &s;he was &s;carcely able to conceal. When the fir&s;t &s;alutations were pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he a&s;ked him how he had di&s;po&s;ed of the exile, and why he did not accompany him to Europe as he had propo&s;ed. He informed her by what means he had procured the exile's e&s;cape; adding, that from the letters he had written, if &s;he had received them, &s;he might at once &s;ee the rea&s;on both of his rejecting the European voyage, and his return to Delhi.</P>
<P>"What would it availed me," &s;aid he, "to have vi&s;ited the di&s;tant regions of the univer&s;e! What plea&s;ure or amu&s;ement could I have expected to find in Europe, when all my heart holds dear was &s;till in A&s;ia? Believe me, this place is now more than the whole world to me; and the friend&s;hip of Almena is the only plea&s;ure I can enjoy."</P>
<P>"I have received your letters," &s;aid &s;he; "and if they &s;peak the language of your heart, I am no &s;tran|ger to its feelings. To deal ingenuou&s;ly with you, I
<PB N="44" REF="030671_0043_0FE85BAB8BB884D0">
am &s;en&s;ible of your merit, and admire your virtues: and were I not more happy in my pre&s;ent condition, than I could hope to be in any other, I know not the man, with whom I would rather divide the enjoy|ments of life, than with Solyman."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible, then," &s;aid Solyman, "that you can think the condition of celibacy happier than that of marriage? Undoubtedly, the principal happine&s;s of mankind depends on the intercour&s;e of &s;ociety, and the connections of friend&s;hip; marriage is nothing el&s;e but a &s;tate of friend&s;hip, in which the friends by u|niting their intere&s;ts, have a con&s;tant and uninterrupt|ed enjoyment of each other. Nature aids this union, and rea&s;on approves it: can any condition bid fairer for happine&s;s, than that in which the mutual delights of friend&s;hip can only be torn from us by the hand of death?</P>
<P>"There may be &s;ome truth," an&s;wered &s;he, "in what you ob&s;erve; but there is an incon&s;tancy in hu|man nature, that makes it dangerous even for two friends to enter into any connection that cannot be broken; and an unaccountable caprice, that makes us quarrel with our happine&s;s, becau&s;e we are &s;ure of en|joying it."</P>
<P>"Were we deterred from every pur&s;uit," &s;aid So|lyman, "by the apprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e inconveniences which the foibles and frailties of our nature might bring upon us, we &s;hould never be either virtuous or happy; but might langui&s;h away our lives in &s;olitary and un&s;ocial indolence. To avoid the inconveniences of human incon&s;tancy, marriage is, &s;urely, the be&s;t in&s;titution in the world; for what could be more like|ly to fix the incon&s;tant, than the habitual intercour&s;e of kindne&s;s and good offices: than that gratitude, which is due to the long exerci&s;e of affectionate ten|derne&s;s; and tho&s;e dear pledges, which mu&s;t depend for happine&s;s and &s;upport on the unanimity of their parents?"</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030671_0044_0FE85BAD16B76A18">"There is, indeed, an in&s;uperable objection to your being married in India: I mean, that contempt, or the horrid alternative of torture, which is entailed on the unhappy woman who &s;urvives her hu&s;band. But that objection &s;hall vani&s;h immediately," continued the lover, with a look of pa&s;&s;ionate earne&s;tne&s;s: "let us go, my friend, let us go to love and happine&s;s in the valley of Irwan. That place, which &s;o lately af|forded a retreat to the lovers who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es I have related to you, &s;hall then become eternally &s;acred to love and friend&s;hip: that place, who&s;e beautiful &s;cenes I &s;o lately beheld with indifference, I &s;hall then vi&s;it with rapture.&mdash;Extacy is in the thought! to enjoy, with Almena the &s;hades of Irwan; with her to walk in my native fields; with her to pluck down on the banks of my favorite &s;tream; for her to pluck the flower, who&s;e beauty may have drawn her attention: to lead her through the&s;e romantic &s;cenes, that delighted the innocent enthu&s;ia&s;m of my childhood: and to &s;how her the more &s;olitary retreats, which I &s;ought when her friend&s;hip had fir&s;t taught me to &s;igh!"</P>
<P>Thus Solyman poured out the natural and pa&s;&s;ion|ate &s;en&s;ations of love; and Almena, who&s;e heart was far from being indifferent to him, ea&s;ily caught the enthu&s;ia&s;m. "To your honor and your friend&s;hip," &s;aid &s;he, "I can tru&s;t every thing. I am ready to at|tend you to tho&s;e &s;cenes, of which you have given me &s;o lively a de&s;cription; whether they may an&s;wer it or not, or whatever they may be, the friend&s;hip of Solyman, will make them agreeable."</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ier to conceive than to expre&s;s the joy which, the lover felt upon this declaration. Within a few, days they &s;et forward from Delhi, on their journey to the valley of Irwan; and for the greater expedition, and the le&s;s fatigue, they determined to go by &s;ea, and accordingly proceeded to the coa&s;t, where they went on board a trading ve&s;&s;el bound for the Per&s;ian gulf.</P>

<P>AT that time there was a war between two petty princes of the higher penin&s;ula of India; and unfortunately, the &s;hip in which they embarked be|longed to one of the&s;e powers.&mdash;They had not proceed|ed above five leagues from the coa&s;t, when they were pur&s;ued by the foe. After an ob&s;tinate and bloody engagement, they were boarded; and their enemies, when they had &s;tripped the ve&s;&s;el of every thing valu|able, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>They di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ve&s;&s;el; but they took Almena. What heart does not bleed, what eye does not &s;hed a tear, for the mi&s;erable Solyman; They di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ve&s;&s;el; but they took Almena! Prayers and tears, and agony and angui&s;h were vain. The lover &s;aw his dear, trembling, fainting maid, dragged by the hands of the unfeeling &s;ailors into their own &s;hip, after they had bound him, to prevent the effects of his rage, "I a&s;k not for your mercy," cried the wretched youth: "only take me into your ve&s;&s;el along with that lady, and prepare your tortures, your racks, and wheels: for me prepare them, and let me peri&s;h, before the&s;e eyes lo&s;e &s;ight of Almena!"</P>
<P>While Solyman was vainly uttering the&s;e pitiable exclamations, the enemy &s;teered away, and was in a &s;hort time out of &s;ight. The men of the &s;hip in which he was, apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome bad con&s;equences from the violence of his rage, were prudent enough to let him continue bound; while he now loaded them with the reproachful terms of &s;laves and cowards, and now excited them by promi&s;es, or entreated them by pray|ers, to pur&s;ue the foe.&mdash;The &s;hip having lo&s;t her freight, did not proceed on her intended voyage, but returned to the coa&s;t of India</P>
<P>When they arrived, Solyman was informed that the ve&s;&s;el which had taken them belonged to the king of Sundah, who at that time was at war with the king of Kanara. Upon this information, as &s;oon as he had
<PB N="47" REF="030671_0046_0FE85BB5D8E8FFB8">
received intelligence of the &s;ituation of the kingdom of Sundah, he went immediately in que&s;t of Almena. Though almo&s;t worn to death with fatigue and &s;or|row, he travelled night and day, till he reached the country. But, alas! when he was there, what could he do? Stranger as he was to the people, and in a great mea&s;ure to their language, he had as much to hope from chance, as from application, for the di&s;cov|ery of Almena.</P>
<P>He would now have &s;unk under the weight of his misfortunes, had he not availed him&s;elf of the fir&s;t advice of Ardavan, and firmly relied on the Eternal Providence. "Immortal Mithra!" &s;aid the afflicted youth, "thou beholde&s;t me oppre&s;&s;ed with mi&s;ery: but thy beams &s;till &s;hine upon me; and while I enjoy thy light, I will hope for thy favor!"</P>
<P>Thus comforting him&s;elf, he &s;till continued his &s;earch: depending, for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upports of na|ture, on the precarious bounty of the villages through which he pa&s;&s;ed; frequently making the mountain rocks the refuge of his night's repo&s;e, when nature, exhau&s;ted with toil and &s;orrow, in her own defence in|clined him to &s;leep. He wandered ince&s;&s;antly from town to town, and from province to province; often expo&s;ed to the attacks of &s;avage bea&s;ts, and often &s;uf|fering the in&s;ults of the more &s;avage people.</P>
<P>Having in vain gone over a large tract of the in|land country, he now confined his &s;earch to the coa&s;t, in hopes that he might again &s;ee the ve&s;&s;el which took his Almena. Day by day he wandered on the beach, con&s;tantly ca&s;ting his eyes on the immen&s;e wa&s;te of waters, and watching the approach of every ve&s;&s;el he &s;aw, with the &s;ame impatience of expectation, as if he had been a&s;&s;ured that it contained Almena.</P>

<P>AS he was walking one evening by the ca&s;|tle of Seva&s;ir, he heard a mournful voice proceeding from a garden within the fort. Solyman never neg|lected the voice of &s;orrow: he went nearer to the place from whence it &s;eemed to proceed; and looking through the iron pali&s;adoes, with which the garden was encompa&s;&s;ed, he beheld a lady &s;itting in a melan|choly po&s;ture on a flower-bank at a &s;mall di&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the irre&s;i&s;table tran&s;port of his heart, he cried a|loud&mdash;"Almena!" The lady ro&s;e; and as &s;he came towards him, he perceived his mi&s;take.&mdash;"Pardon me, Madam," &s;aid he; "I am an unhappy man who have lo&s;t every thing that is dear to me, in a lady whom I have &s;ought in vain for many months in this province; where I have &s;till rea&s;on to believe &s;he is confined, if indeed &s;he yet lives; if &s;he is not fallen a &s;arifice to her own mi&s;eries, or to the barbarous cruelty of the villains who tore her from me.</P>
<P>"Stranger," &s;aid the lady, "it is long &s;ince I have known any comfort my&s;elf, and I am afraid I can have little for you. Your mi&s;eries affect me much: the &s;ame did my beloved hu&s;band once undergo, for whom I now mourn, and mu&s;t forever mourn in hope|le&s;s &s;orrow."</P>
<P>"Is your hu&s;band then dead?" &s;aid Solyman; "or is he only lo&s;t to you as Almena is to me? if the lat|ter is the ca&s;e, you may yet have hope; the all-&s;eeing eye of Providence looks down upon all his creatures, and he will a&s;&s;uredly redre&s;s the misfortunes of the virtuous.</P>
<P>"We were inhabitants," replied the lady, "of the kingdom of Kanara. The Sundians, who made an incur&s;ion into our territories, among&s;t many other wretched people, carried off my hu&s;band and me&mdash;" "How, madam!" interrupted Solyman: "they were merciful, if they &s;uffered your hu&s;band to accompany you."&mdash;"Their mercy," &s;aid &s;he, "did not extend &s;o
<PB N="49" REF="030671_0048_0FE85C4ADE3473D0">
far: they pre&s;ented me to the governor of this ca&s;tle; and my hu&s;band they impri&s;oned in a di&s;tant part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince I came within the&s;e hated walls, their &s;avage ma&s;ter has aggravated my mi&s;eries, by the mortifying offers of his love; totally regardle&s;s of my &s;orrow and di&s;traction, a thou&s;and times has the unfeel|ing wretch in&s;ulted my torn heart with odious care&s;&s;es, and &s;till continues to per&s;ecute me in the &s;ame manner, upbraiding me with ingratitude for what he calls his kindne&s;s in permitting me to live. But I am not a|lone in my misfortunes; here are numbers of unhap|py women under the &s;ame confinement, who&s;e &s;uffer|ings too nearly re&s;emble my own. Some of them, like me, have &s;till re&s;i&s;ted the importunities of the tyrant; while others, more, I hope through fear than inclina|tion&punc; have unhappily &s;ubmitted to his will."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, terror and apprehen&s;ion were again rou&s;ed in the heart of Solyman, and created a conflict which &s;hook his frame. He &s;tood agha&s;t and motion|le&s;s for a moment: at la&s;t recollecting him&s;elf&mdash;"Is there" &s;aid he, "tell me, Madam, is there a lady with|in the&s;e walls, a native of Delhi, who was taken &s;ome months ago from on board a Kanarian ve&s;&s;el by the Sundians?</P>
<P>"To that que&s;tion," &s;aid the lady, "I can make no an&s;wer: we are all kept in different apartments, and not allowed to conver&s;e with each other; we are not even permitted, but alone, to walk in the&s;e gardens: and &s;hould I now be ob&s;erved to talk with you, though through the&s;e dete&s;ted bars my future liberty would probably be endangered. All that you can do to know, whether the lady you have lo&s;t be in this place, is to attend at the different hours of the day near the&s;e pal|i&s;adoes; where you will be able to ob&s;erve, in their re&s;pective turns, the appearance of the women in the gardens. But you will incur great danger in the ex|periment: and, after all, &s;hould you find that your la|dy is here, what can it avail you? You will only have the mortification to know it, without being able to re&s;cue her.</P>

<P>SOLYMAN took his leave of the lady; and having formed his re&s;olution, waited with the ut|mo&s;t impatience for the light of morning. He hap|pened, indeed, to be &s;o far &s;ecured from &s;u&s;picion, as to be dre&s;&s;ed in a Sundian habit, which belonged to an officer of the &s;hip that carried off Almena, who compelled him to take it in exchange for his own. But in&s;en&s;ible of danger, at the earlie&s;t dawn he ha&s;t|ed to his po&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed the day in alternate hope and de&s;pair: he &s;aw many women, but he &s;aw not Almena. In the evening therefore, regretting the di&s;appointment even of tho&s;e expectations which he dreaded to have confirmed, he re&s;olved to quit his &s;ta|tion till the return of morning, when, by the glim|mering of the moon, he perceived another lady enter the garden.</P>
<P>As &s;he came nearer, her image glanced through his heart more &s;wiftly than the lightning &s;mites the traveller on the mountains of Hima. The lady was Almena. In a bur&s;t of tran&s;port, he cried&mdash; "Al|mena! Solyman!" Struck at once with the voice, the name, and the figure of Solyman, &s;urpri&s;e over|came her, and &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the terrace.</P>
<P>Solyman, unable to enter the garden, in an agony of terror cried out&mdash;"Save, &s;ave my Almena; at the &s;ame time running round the walls in the utmo&s;t di&s;traction. His exclamations alarmed the guard, who immediately &s;ecured him; though, from his cries and confu&s;ion, they concluded him to be mad, and made their report of him as &s;uch to the governor of the ca&s;tle, who ordered him to be immediately brought before him.</P>
<P>Solyman, the moment he beheld the governor, fiercely cried out&mdash;"I conjure thee, if thou art a hu|man being, let me in&s;tantly fly to the relief of a lady in the garden." The governor was alarmed by an appearance of rea&s;on in this reque&s;t, and ordered him
<PB N="51" REF="030671_0050_0FE85BC662F854E0">
&s;ecured, while he went him&s;elf into the gardens to know if there was any foundation for it. There he found Almena &s;upporting her&s;elf again&s;t the wall, not having perfectly recovered either her &s;trength or rea&s;on. "Art thou, indeed, my Solyman? &s;aid &s;he: "if thou art my Solyman, &s;upport me in thy arms." in his arms he took her, and bore her to a pavilion: where he held her till her rea&s;on returned. She turn|ed her eyes full upon him; and, with a look of fear and &s;orrow, &s;hrunk from his embrace.</P>
<P>"Tell me, Madam; I be&s;eech you tell me," &s;aid the governor; "what is the cau&s;e of this di&s;traction? Why are tho&s;e dear eyes &s;o full of wildne&s;s and hor|ror? and why do you look upon your protector with &s;uch aver&s;ion? Is there then &s;ome other per&s;on more happy in your favor and affection? and mu&s;t I forev|er langui&s;h at your feet in vain?"</P>
<P>"If thou ha&s;t any other affection for me," &s;aid Al|mena, "than that which is in&s;pired by brutal in&s;tinct; if thou ha&s;t more feeling than the walls that &s;ur|round thee, thou wilt &s;urely pity me. The dear un|happy man, whom I fear ere now thy guards have &s;eized, is the friend for who&s;e lo&s;s thou ha&s;t known me mourn ever &s;ince I came within thy power. Yes, thou wilt pity me for thou has wept: when I related to thee my mi&s;eries the tears of compa&s;&s;ion flowed from thine eyes. Let us throw our&s;elves at thy feet; let us owe our happine&s;s to thee, and thou &s;halt have all the affection which is not due to Solyman.</P>
<P>The weeping beauty, as &s;he uttered the&s;e words, threw her&s;elf before him in &s;uch an agony of &s;orrow, and &s;uch a po&s;ture of &s;upplication, as would have moved any heart in which vice had not extingui&s;hed every &s;park of humanity. Far from being affected by it, the governor of Sava&s;ir made her the follow|ing an&s;wer&mdash; "Ab&s;urd and vain! to &s;uppo&s;e that I &s;hould tamely yield that happine&s;s to another, which I could never obtain my&s;elf. Know, Madam, that both you and your lover are now in my power; and
<PB N="52" REF="030671_0051_0FE85BC7EDD07C30">
that he has no indulgence to hope for but what your kindne&s;s to me may procure him." With the&s;e words he withdrew; rather le&s;s offended at the thought of having a rival in Almena's affections than plea&s;ed with the hope that he might terrify her into compliance by his menaces again&s;t her lover.</P>
<P>Almena remained in the mo&s;t pitiful di&s;tre&s;s, &s;har|pened by painful apprehen&s;ions for her own honor, and the life of Solyman; and wandering alone into the garden &s;he added one night of &s;orrow more to the many &s;he had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Great God! what mi&s;ery may one villain, armed with power, bring upon thy creatures! Were there not a &s;tate of exi&s;tence, where vice &s;hall be puni&s;hed and virtue rewarded, how would thy works &s;eem to reproach their Almighty Maker! But let the &s;ons of men learn, that he who is infinitely wi&s;e, is al&s;o per|fectly ju&s;t; and that he can as ea&s;ily take cognizance of the moral conduct of his creatures, as he could at fir&s;t create this immen&s;e &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, in which the minute&s;t creature declares the &s;kill of the Architect.</P>

<P>THE i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">pous tyrant of Seva&s;ir enjoyed the balm of &s;leep and the refre&s;hment of re&s;t, while the virtuous Solyman and Almena &s;uffered the mo&s;t grievous affliction.</P>
<P>When the morning appeared, Nagrakut, for that was the wretch's name, went at the u&s;ual hour into the garden, Almena who was &s;till there, overcome by the weight of continual &s;orrow, had &s;unk into a tran|&s;ient &s;lumber on a bench in the pavilion. Nagrakut, approached and &s;tood by her as &s;he &s;lumbered. There was a &s;ight that might have excited tenderne&s;s in the brea&s;t of a &s;avage: but it moved not the heart
<PB N="53" REF="030671_0052_0FE85BCECA40DCD8">
of Nagrakut, nor awakened any other pa&s;&s;ion in him but that of a libidinous de&s;ire. In a dream, &s;he wav|ed her hand, and cried, with a voice of mournful ten|derne&s;s, "Do not murder him, Nagrakut! Let my Solyman live!" then letting fall the hand &s;he had rai&s;ed, &s;he &s;unk again into &s;ilent &s;lumber.</P>
<P>Nagrakut yet felt no pity; but placing him&s;elf near her on the bench, inclo&s;ed her in his arms. She awoke; and finding her&s;elf in the embraces of the ty|rant, &s;hrieked out with the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful horror. Her cries pierced the cell where Solyman was confin|ed. With the united &s;trength of rage and terror, he bur&s;t the door of his pri&s;on; and running through the apartments of the ca&s;tle with a dagger in his hand, which he had fortunately &s;natched up in the way, he flew to the Garden.</P>
<P>Almena was &s;till &s;hrieking and &s;truggling in the arms of Nagrakut, who endeavoring to &s;ooth her to his embraces, had not ob&s;erved the approach of So|lyman. "Villain," &s;aid Solyman, "remove thy ex|ecrable hands from the per&s;on of that lady, and em|ploy them in the defence of thy own!" Nagrakut, who was the mo&s;t abject coward, called aloud to his guards. "Coward! &s;lave!" &s;aid Solyman; "draw this in&s;tant, or my dagger &s;hall pierce thy heart." Nagrakut then fell at his feet; and begging for mer|cy, promi&s;ed him Almena and liberty. "This mo|ment then," &s;aid Solyman, "di&s;mi&s;s us from thy cur&s;ed pri&s;on." No &s;ooner had he uttered the&s;e words than the guards appeared. Nagrakut imme|diately beckoned to them to &s;eize him: but Solyman, ob&s;erving his motion, ha&s;tily ran up to him, and plunging his dagger into his heart.</P>
<P>The tyrant fell. No way of e&s;cape, however, was le&s;t for Solyman: he was in&s;tantly &s;eized by the &s;ol|diers, loaded with heavy chains, and &s;hut up, with Almena, in a &s;trong apartment of the ca&s;tle: with Almena he was &s;hut up, for jealou&s;y now no longer
<PB N="54" REF="030671_0053_0FE85BD057A78EA8">
parted them; and &s;he was con&s;idered as an accom|plice in the murder of the governor.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance admini&s;tered inexpre&s;&s;ible con|&s;olation to them both. "At la&s;t, my Almena," &s;aid the lover, "fortune has brought thee to my arms; but after what mi&s;eries, good Heaven! and in what circum&s;tances! Yet my Heart never once doubted the ju&s;tice or the care of Providence; we &s;hall yet be happy in the valley of Irwan."</P>
<P>The &s;pirits of Almena were &s;o exhau&s;ted by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ravages of terror, &s;orrow and &s;urpri&s;e, that &s;he reclined for &s;ome time in the arms of Solyman, unable to &s;peak, and only venting her grief in broken and feeble &s;ighs. The officers of the ca&s;tle of Seva|&s;ir had &s;ent in the mean time to the king of Sundah, to know in what manner he would have the muderers of the governor executed.</P>
<P>The death of a villain is &s;eldom regretted, even by tho&s;e to whom his villainies have been of &s;ervice. The king of Sundah always hated the governor of Seva&s;ir; but he dared not depo&s;e him, becau&s;e he had been e&s;tabli&s;hed under him by the mogul: he, therefore, &s;ent no other commands to the officers of the ca&s;tle, but that the pri&s;oners &s;hould remain there till farther orders.</P>
<P>Not long after this, a body of Kanarians entered the country of Sundah, and laid &s;eige to the ca&s;tle of Seva&s;ir. As the death of the governor had thrown all into confu&s;ion, the fort was ea&s;ily carried; and the Kanarians took pri&s;oners all that were within the ca&s;tle. Solyman and Almena, though they could not be di&s;plea&s;ed at this change of fortune had yet another to encounter, which might prove as fatal to their happine&s;s as any they had e&s;caped could have been.</P>
<P>It is a cu&s;tom in the ea&s;tern nations, to pre&s;ent the women taken in war to the kings, that they may &s;elect whom they like: and the re&s;t are divided among the officers, according to their &s;everal ranks. All the la|dies
<PB N="55" REF="030671_0054_0FE85BD746A727D0">
that were taken in the ca&s;tle of Seva&s;ir, had this fate to undergo; and as the governor had been curi|ous in his choice, the&s;e women were looked upon as a mo&s;t valuable capture.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THEY were immediately conveyed to the court of Kanara, and pre&s;ented to the king for his choice. They all &s;tood before him at the &s;ame time; and he looked upon each of them for &s;ome minutes: but his eye dwelt longer on Almena than the re&s;t. Unfortunately, &s;he ob&s;erved this; and her fear and confu&s;ion new animated her features, and gave fre&s;h beauties to her complexion. The king immediately &s;elected her, and the re&s;t were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Solyman was all this time kept with the garri&s;on of Seva&s;ir as a pri&s;oner of war: but at length hav|ing convinced the Kanarians, that he had no connec|tions with the king of Sundah, and that he was wil|ling to enter into the &s;ervice of their prince, his liber|ty was re&s;tored him. This was the only means by which he could attempt the recovery of Almena; who, as he was now informed, was retained by the king. He immediately repaired to the capital of Kanaria; and &s;ignifying to the officers of the court that he had &s;ome important intelligence relating to the war, to communicate to his maje&s;ty, he gained an ea&s;y admittance to him.</P>
<P>When the king appeared he pro&s;trated him&s;elf be|fore him; and being commanded to &s;peak, he thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf: "Let the king of Kanaria live! for his ear is open to the complaints of the unhappy, and he de&s;pi&s;eth no man for the mi&s;eries which chance hath brought upon him."&mdash;"I am a man," interpo&s;|ed the king; "proceed."&mdash;"It was my hand that put an end to the life of your enemy, the governor of Se|va&s;ir.
<PB N="56" REF="030671_0055_0FE85C5205260228">
"In that, replied the prince, "you did me a &s;ig|nal &s;ervice: but let me know your motives; and I &s;hall be better able to judge of the action, as well as of my obligations to you for it."</P>
<P>"O Prince!" &s;aid Solyman, "I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a lady, more beautiful than the &s;tar that overflows its urn in the evening, and dearer to me than the life drops of my heart. We were on board a Kanarian ve&s;&s;el that was trading to the Per&s;ian Gulph; and were bound to the valley of Irwan in Me&s;opotamia, the place of my nativity: but alas! before we had proceeded many leagues from our coa&s;t, we were boarded by a pirate of Sundah. We were plunder|ed and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; but the dear partner of my heart was taken from me. After long &s;earch, I found that &s;he was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the governor of Seva&s;ir; who regardle&s;s of her mi&s;eries, or the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart, cruelly continued to in&s;ult her with the of|fer of his love."&mdash;"Inhuman wretch!" interrupted the king: "but proceed."&mdash;This ejaculation gave Solyman new hopes, and he continued his relation.</P>
<P>"Walking one evening by the gardens of the fort, I di&s;covered her on a terrace at a &s;mall di&s;tance. She was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;uddenne&s;s of my ap|pearance, that &s;he fainted. Being unable to enter the gardens, in my di&s;tre&s;s I cried for help; and my cries alarming the guard, I was &s;eized. That night I was confined in a dungeon of the ca&s;tle; but early the next morning hearing the &s;hrieks of a female voice, which I either knew or fear imagined to be that of my love, rage and terror gave me more than natural &s;trength, and I bur&s;t open the door of my pri&s;on. I was unarmed; but, fortunately, a dagger lying in my way, I &s;natched it up, and flew to the garden from whence the voice proceeded. There I beheld the dear object of my affections trembling in the em|braces of the tyrant: at the &s;ight of me, he called a|loud to his guards, cowardly refu&s;ing the offer I gave him of defending him&s;elf again&s;t my dagger; nay,
<PB N="57" REF="030671_0056_0FE85BD8D2325EF8">
he meanly begged his life, and offered me, on that condition liberty for my&s;elf and the lady; but the guards immediately coming up, he beckoned to them to &s;eize me: I found time, however, to thru&s;t my dagger into his ba&s;e heart, thus the villain peri&s;hed." &mdash;"And ju&s;tice &s;aid the king directed your arm."</P>
<P>"O prince!" continued Solyman, I am &s;till mi&s;er|able. I have rea&s;on to believe, that &s;ome of your of|ficers will detain the lady, as a prize taken in the ca&s;|tle of Seva&s;ir."&mdash;"No officer of mine," replied the king, "&s;hall be &s;uffered to detain her: let me know her name, and &s;he &s;hall be immediately re&s;tored to you."&mdash;"Her name," &s;aid Solyman, "is Almena."</P>
<P>The king appeared di&s;turbed, and walked backward and forward for &s;ome moments, in the utmo&s;t confu|&s;ion. He knew, that Almena was the lady whom he had &s;elected from the captives; and he had the mo&s;t ardent affection for her. In a few moments he with|drew, and commanded Solyman to attend him the following day.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="23" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE heart of the king was, in the mean time di&s;tracted by different pa&s;&s;ions; urged by the mo&s;t powerful love to detain Almena, and di&s;&s;uaded from that by truth, humanity, and &s;hame. "Am I," &s;aid he, "po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a throne, and &s;hall I have no more power to indulge my wi&s;hes, than the pea&s;ant of the field! what is the worth or the end of ab&s;o|lute power, if kings mu&s;t tamely &s;acrafice their incli|nations, to the creatures they were born to command! Shall I give up &s;uch beauty as that of Almena! a beauty that has &s;mitten my heart, and in&s;pired me with &s;uch tenderne&s;s of affection as I never yet felt for woman! But Almena was Solyman's!&mdash;It might be &s;o; but &s;he is now mine. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion goes from
<PB N="58" REF="030671_0057_0FE85C538FA7CC18">
one to another, according to the laws of nation; and, by tho&s;e laws, Almena is mine."</P>
<P>"Why then do I feel the&s;e unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, as much at the thoughts of keeping, as of parting with her! the laws of nature and truth create them. The laws of nations ought always to be founded on the&s;e; and the&s;e &s;ugge&s;t to me, that to keep Almena, would be mo&s;t injurious and inhuman. Shall I, who have condemned that in another, as a crime which de&s;erved the puni&s;hment of death, commit the very &s;ame my|&s;elf! what a dete&s;table hypocrite &s;hould I appear! Shall I, who promi&s;ed the lover that none of my offi|cers &s;hould deprive him of Almena; &s;hall I degrade the king by doing what I would have puni&s;hed in a &s;ubject? I love Almena, and &s;hould be exqui&s;itely happy in the enjoyment of her; but &s;hall I, therefore, make her mi&s;erable! How &s;hould I ever partake of happine&s;s, if the object of my affections lived with me in &s;ullen di&s;content, or incon&s;olable &s;orrow? Ba&s;e and unworthy of the heart of man, mu&s;t be that love, which would purcha&s;e its gratification by the mi&s;ery of its object! The heart of Almena is Soly|man's, and &s;o &s;hall be her per&s;on: painful is the alter|native; but truth, and honor, and virtue mu&s;t pre|vail!"</P>
<P>Thus the generous king of Kanara overcame the efforts of importunate de&s;ire, by the force of virtue and rea&s;on; and nobly &s;corned to avail him&s;elf of his power again&s;t an unhappy man, who had been long per&s;ecuted by misfortune, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in his love.</P>
<P>The hour came at which he had ordered Solyman to attend him. The king received him with a conde|&s;cending &s;mile; and without the lea&s;t appearance of unea&s;ine&s;s or di&s;&s;atisfaction in his countenance, de&s;ired him not to be apprehen&s;ive about Almena, for that he &s;hould &s;hortly be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken, he went immediately to her apartment, and gently taking her hand, "Mo&s;t beau|tiful of the daughters of India," &s;aid he, "cea&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="030671_0058_0FE85BDFF626C330">
your &s;orrows! I am not come to offer you my love; but to recommend to you another lover, who po&s;&s;ibly may be happier in your favor than I could ever hope to be: he is now in the palace; and if you will give me leave, I will in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">oduce him to you."&mdash;"My heart." &s;aid Almena, "has been &s;o much accu&s;tomed to new di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that it is not now &s;hocked by their frequen|cy: but if you have any pity for me, &s;uffer me to be|wail my mi&s;eries in &s;olitude. Not to be interrupted in my &s;orrows, is all I a&s;k; and that is not, &s;urely, too much for you to grant." The king an&s;wered with a &s;mile, "If I am not to be happy in your love, I am determined that none but the per&s;on whom I am a|bout to introduce to you, &s;hall be &s;o;" and ha&s;tily quitting the appartment, returned with Solyman. The lovers flew to each others arms; "My Solyman!" &mdash;"My Almena!" In a few moments being recol|lected, they threw them&s;elves at the feet of the king; and Solyman, as well as the tran&s;ports of his heart would give him leave, expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude: "Gen|erous prince," &s;aid he, "the thanks of Solyman are not worth your acceptance. But you will not be without a reward: yours &s;hall be the &s;upreme plea&s;|ure of con&s;cious goodne&s;s; yours &s;hall be the care of Eternal Providence, and the prayers and ble&s;&s;ings of Solyman and Almena!"</P>
<P>In the gratitude of his heart, Solyman offered the king his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the pro&s;ecution of the war with the Sundians; but he humanely refu&s;ed his offer; telling him that love and war were no allies; that his &s;ufferings had already been too many and too great; and that neither he &s;hould be expo&s;ed to danger, nor Almena to fear, on his account. He moreover told them, that if they were inclined to return by &s;ea to the valley of Irwan, they &s;hould be attended by an ar|med ve&s;&s;el, to &s;ecure them from the a&s;&s;aults of an en|emy. But this obliging offer they declined; Soly|man was unwilling any more to ri&s;que that which was dearer than life; and Almena yet trembled at
<PB N="60" REF="030671_0059_0FE85BE187B47920">
the thoughts of the Sundian pirate. They, therefore, notwith&s;tanding the length and tediou&s;ne&s;s of the way, determined to go by land; and having taken leave of the king, who &s;upplied them with every ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and lent them his own bea&s;ts and attendants, they &s;et their faces towards Delhi.</P>

<P>THEIR road was through a mountainous country, trouble&s;ome to the traveller; little cultiva|ted by the labors, or enlivened by the habitations of men. But what are the difficulties which love and hope cannot &s;urmount! they de&s;pi&s;e the threats of danger, and the toils of labor; and proceed with re&s;|olution through tho&s;e perplexities, which by other eyes are beheld with de&s;pair. The travellers thus an|imated, and looking forward to tho&s;e delightful &s;cenes of re&s;t, tho&s;e days of rural ea&s;e and happine&s;s which they &s;hould enjoy in the valley of Irwan, pa&s;&s;ed over the rugged mountains that oppo&s;ed their way, with|out the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of wearine&s;s or fear.</P>
<P>After travelling many days, without any accident or delay, more than the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment of na|ture required, they arrived at Delhi. At the &s;ight of her native place, Almena &s;hed a tear of joy, and the lovers embraced each other with more than com|mon tenderne&s;s: &s;o much is there in the power of ex|ternal circum&s;tances, to improve and exalt the plea&s;|ures of the mind. Almena always loved her Soly|man with the mo&s;t tender affection; but &s;he loved him at Delhi, more than in any other place: delight is in&s;eparable from the idea of tho&s;e &s;cenes, where we have pa&s;&s;ed the happy hours of childhood; and though, when in a maturity of life we revi&s;it our na|tive countries, we cannot enjoy that innocent thought|le&s;s chearfulne&s;s, of which we &s;till retain &s;ome notion;
<PB N="61" REF="030671_0060_0FE85BE87A46E648">
yet we are delighted with the remembrance of it, and tho&s;e &s;cenes are always dear to us.</P>
<P>Almena forgot not to vi&s;it her village, and the peo|ple whom &s;he called her own. The poor inhabitants, at the &s;ight of their benefactre&s;s, wept with plea&s;ure; and &s;he did not leave them without giving them new exhortations to their duty, and new in&s;tances of her beneficence. Indeed, in all generous acts &s;he now doubled her a&s;&s;iduities: for &s;he concluded, that, on account of her great and &s;ingular obligations to Providence, &s;he ought in gratitude to have a &s;uperior portion of virtue.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort &s;tay at Delhi, Solyman and Almena renewed their journey, and &s;et forward to I&s;pahan. This route was longer; but it was more ea&s;y, and le&s;s expo&s;ed to robbers, than that which led to the Per&s;ian Gulf. When they arrived at I&s;pahan, Solyman had the plea&s;ure to find his friend the merchant, who was &s;till detained by bu&s;ine&s;s in that city. He ea&s;ily made his apology for not accepting, as he had propo&s;ed, his kind offer of a pa&s;&s;age into Europe, by introduc|ing him to Almena. He related to him their vari|ous intere&s;ting adventures, to which he li&s;tened with the eager curio&s;ity and concern of a friend, acknowl|edging all along the hand of Providence in their pre&s;|ervation. For the amiable and accompli&s;hed Alme|na, he felt great e&s;teem: her pathetic de&s;criptions, and her ju&s;t and natural ob&s;ervations, were extremely entertaining and affecting. But he was mo&s;t charm|ed with the character of the king of Kanara; and reque&s;ted Almena to relate every particular of his behavior.</P>
<P>"When I fir&s;t beheld him" &s;aid &s;he "I perceived in his countenance a noble affability and openne&s;s, which &s;eemed to &s;peak a great and generous mind. This gave me &s;ome plea&s;ure; as I might have hopes from his compa&s;&s;ion, &s;hould it be my fate to be &s;elected by him: &s;uch you know it was.&mdash;When I was con|ducted into an apartment of the palace, he waited on
<PB N="62" REF="030671_0061_0FE85BEA08D1F710">
me with the mo&s;t affable politene&s;s; and &s;eeing me in tears, he gently took my hand, and &s;poke to the following effect. "Be not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, fair Almena! Though you are in the power of a prince, you are not in the hands of a tyrant. If time and the a&s;&s;i|duities of tenderne&s;s may prevail on you to return my love, I &s;hall be happy; if not, you &s;hall never be made mi&s;erable by cruelty or by violence." "Con|&s;i&s;tent with this declaration, was his whole conduct to me, during the time I was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. How I regained my liberty, you have already heard."</P>
<P>"To the character which you have already receiv|ed of the Kanarian prince," &s;aid Solyman to the mer|chant, "I will add a poetical portrait, which po&s;&s;ibly may not be di&s;agreeable to you: my gratitude for his favors, and my admiration of his virtues, induced me to attempt it."</P>

<P>"The ode you have obliged me with," &s;aid Soly|man, "though I do not very well under&s;tand it, gives me &s;ome idea of the enthu&s;ia&s;m and harmony of the Engli&s;h poetry. But I am le&s;s plea&s;ed with the pro|ductions of art in your country, than the affectionate duty which the people &s;how to their king; for that is the ba&s;is of civil happine&s;s; and indeed every human prince, who has the intere&s;t of his &s;ubjects at heart, will always reign in their affections.</P>
<P>But now, my friend, if you are not too much ta|ken up with your concerns at I&s;pahan, will you be prevailed on to vi&s;it the valley of Irwan? As you are a lover of nature, and of the mu&s;es, you will there meet with much to entertain you; at lea&s;t, you

will find a retreat from the fatigues of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the plagues of popularity. Almena too joins in this reque&s;t, and will be glad of &s;o entertaining a friend in the fir&s;t &s;tages of her retirement."</P>
<P>The merchant accepted the invitation, and they left I&s;pahan the following day. He was de&s;irous to hear from Almena the &s;tory of her captivity, and took the fir&s;t opportunity to reque&s;t it: "I have heard," &s;aid he, "from Solyman, the greate&s;t part of your adven|tures; but I have not been informed how you pa&s;&s;ed that unhappy period of time, from your being taken by the Sundians, to your departure from the ca&s;tle at Seva&s;ir."</P>
<P>"You call back memory, Sir," &s;aid Almena, "to the days of mi&s;ery: but as I can, at this di&s;tance, look upon them without terror, I will endeavor to de&s;|cribe them to you.</P>
<P>"When I was fir&s;t taken by the Sundians, my di&s;|traction was &s;o great, that I retain no Idea of what pa&s;&s;ed, till the captain of the ve&s;&s;el conveyed me on &s;hore to the ca&s;tle of Seva&s;ir and pre&s;ented me, terri|fied and almo&s;t frantic as I was, to the dete&s;ted gov|ernor; who as I have been &s;ince informed, received &s;uch kind of acknowledgments from the &s;eamen, for protecting them in their illegal and piratical captures.</P>
<P>"The wretch, as well as I remember, &s;eemed total|ly in&s;en&s;ible to my mi&s;ery; and, with a &s;mile upon his countenance, ordered his dome&s;tics to convey me to my apartments. The&s;e, indeed, wanted neither el|egance nor convenience; but I de&s;pi&s;ed the one, and neglected the other. The fir&s;t evening I pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t painful angui&s;h for the lo&s;s of Solyman, and the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions of injurious treatment from the governor. The women that were about me, &s;eemed the wretched remains of ruined innocence, who had fir&s;t been victims to the de&s;ires of the tyrant, and afterwards made his &s;laves. Dreadful was the &s;cene I had before me! Some of the&s;e unhappy crea|tures &s;eemed to pity me, and to be concerned for my
<PB N="67" REF="030671_0066_0FE85BFB9F206628">
approaching misfortunes; while others, who with their virtue had lo&s;t their humanity, looked upon me with a carele&s;s &s;corn; plea&s;ed, I fear, with the tho't, that they &s;hould &s;ee one woman more, as mi&s;erable and as de&s;picable as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"Early the next morning, the governor came into my apartment; and ca&s;ting his eyes upon the bed on which I had not repo&s;ed, "it &s;eems, madam," &s;aid he, with a &s;cornful &s;mile, "that you approve not of your lodgings; but a little time, it is to be pre&s;umed, will reconcile you to us." The&s;e morning vi&s;its he con|&s;tantly paid me; and as he always found me in &s;ul|len &s;orrow, he behaved much in the &s;ame manner. At la&s;t, he changed his addre&s;s; &s;eemed to pity me; a&s;ked me for the &s;tory of my misfortunes; and I be|lieve wept, when he heard it; but as I was aware of the hypocrite, I was equally regardle&s;s of his pity, as I had been of his &s;corn: and &s;till continued to look upon him, with the &s;ame forbidding aver&s;ion and di&s;|dain.</P>
<P>"Thus pa&s;&s;ed my days in this confinement: but they would have been more intolerable, had I not found a harp in my apartments, which probably had been left there by &s;ome unhappy lady, who had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them before me. With this in&s;trument I amu&s;|ed my&s;elf for many a melancholy hour, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have pa&s;&s;ed away in the mo&s;t mi&s;erable lan|guor, I al&s;o compo&s;ed a &s;ong, &s;uitable to my &s;tate of mind and misfortune; which I adapted to my harp, and which, I think, was as follows:</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<P>THE travellers had now proceeded on their way to the valley of Irwan, as far as the village of Abdat; where Solyman propo&s;ed that they &s;hould vi&s;it the lovers who owed their pre&s;ervation to him. Of this he was the more de&s;irous; as he had never &s;een them, &s;ince he had fir&s;t recommended them to the protection of his father; but the plea&s;ure he propo&s;ed to him|&s;elf from this vi&s;it, aro&s;e not from a de&s;ire of being flattered with their acknowledgments, but of behold|ing and enjoying their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The lovers received their benefactor, with the great|e&s;t ardor of gratitude; but at the &s;ame time with that delicacy, which proved it to be &s;incere: they were not loud in their acknowledgments, nor officious in their compliments; but yet their attention to their gue&s;t, &s;hewed how much they were delighted with this opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing their re&s;pect for Soly|man. The travellers, in the mean time, were not le&s;s plea&s;ed to behold the peculiar happine&s;s of the lovers, who &s;eemed to have but one heart, and one inclina|tion. Solyman and Almena beheld, in them, a pic|ture of them&s;elves; and felt more &s;en&s;ibly their own felicity, when they had before them &s;o plea&s;ing an image of it.</P>
<P>The merchant too was delighted with this &s;cene of conjugal happine&s;s. "Such," &s;aid he to Solyman, "are the genuine fruits of tho&s;e alliances, which are made by love. When I behold them, I blu&s;h for my|&s;elf and for my countrymen; for love, genuine love, as if it were no longer a pa&s;&s;ion e&s;&s;ential to human nature, is looked upon as an Utopian idea, exi&s;ting on|ly in the imagination of poets and enthu&s;ia&s;ts: hence, every tendency to it is ridiculed as romantic, and modern marriages are only contracts of convenience. A Briti&s;h lady is expo&s;ed to &s;ale; and if &s;he has a good per&s;on, as well as an ample fortune &s;he hopes by
<PB N="70" REF="030671_0069_0FE85C04900593E8">
that addition only to fetch a higher price, and make a better market. This, however, it mu&s;t be owned, is not the foible of the women only, the men are equally, if not more mercenary; and have if po&s;&s;i|ble, more &s;elfi&s;h views in their marriages; &s;o that, in this ca&s;e, cunning is only oppo&s;ed to cunning. All this proceeds from that mi&s;chievous opinion, which mea&s;ures happine&s;s by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of fortune. Hence, that mutual coldne&s;s and indifference, which both experience before the marriage torch is extinct: from new acqui&s;itions of wealth, each expects new degrees of felicity, and both are di&s;appointed; when they find them&s;elves mi&s;taken, de&s;titute of that affec|tionate tenderne&s;s which endears the married &s;tate, they look upon each other as the cau&s;e of di&s;content, and di&s;gu&s;t and aver&s;ion &s;ucceed. Thus they &s;acrifice to vanity, and reap the fruits of it!"</P>
<P>From the village of Abdat, Solyman and Almena, with their friend the merchant, proceeded to the val|ley of Irwan, where they found the aged Ardavan &s;till living, and enjoying all the faculties of nature. The benevolent &s;age rejoiced to receive his &s;on, not only &s;afe from the dangers of travel, but happy in the enjoyment of his love; and with a heart full of ten|derne&s;s, he thus conferred on both, his paternal bene|diction:</P>
<P>"Children of the heart, and comfort of the years of Ardavan! Solyman &s;hall be as the &s;un, when he cometh from the chambers of the ea&s;t, when he &s;pread|eth his glories over the waves of Ganges; my &s;on &s;hall be as the Euphrates, the river of plenty, who&s;e waves are the delight of a thou&s;and meadows; he &s;hall be like the roe upon the mountains, that danceth in the vigor of his heart, and &s;aith to the fence of the hu&s;bandman, "What art thou?" His head &s;hall be crowned with the rays of Mithra; becau&s;e his heart melted with compa&s;&s;ion, and becau&s;e his hand was &s;tretched forth to relieve the children of affliction!</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="030671_0070_0FE85C5C223629D8">"Almena is fairer than the women of the ea&s;t; &s;he is more virtuous than the daughters of men: love dwelleth in her heart, and benevolence &s;itteth in her eye. She &s;hall be like the tree that droppeth balm up|on the flowers of Irwan; as the &s;tar of the evening reflected from the river. Her countenance &s;hall be plea&s;ant as the calm &s;urface of the ocean, when the gilded clouds of evening blaze upon its bo&s;om: &s;he &s;hall be as the moon, when &s;he lendeth her rays to the traveller, and &s;heddeth a mild light over the groves and vallies. Her voice &s;hall be as the voice of the turtle, calling to her mate in the thickets of the for|e&s;t. Like the &s;tars that &s;urround the chariot of the moon, &s;hall be the children of Almena; beautiful as the plants of the cedar, and &s;prightly as the fawns upon the mountains!"</P>
<P>Thus ble&s;&s;ed by the voice of Ardavan, and happy in them&s;elves, the virtuous Solyman and Almena live in the valley of Irwan! Each day is endeared by the delights of tender love; and the remembrance of pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es is attended only with the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;a|tions of gratitude to that Being, who&s;e providence is over all his works.</P>

<L>To thee, my humble voice I rai&s;e:</L>
<L>Forgive, while I pre&s;ume to prai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Affliction flies, and Hope returns;</L>
<L>Her lamp with brighter &s;plendor burns.</L>
<L>Gay Love, with all his &s;miling train,</L>
<L>And joy and peace are here again.</L>
<L>The&s;e, the&s;e, I know, 'twas thine to give:</L>
<L>I tru&s;ted; and behold! I live.</L>
<L>To thee, my humble voice I rai&s;e;</L>
<L>Forgive while I pre&s;ume to prai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O may I &s;till thy favor prove!</L>
<L>Still grant me gratitude and love.</L>
<L>Let truth and virtue guide my heart;</L>
<L>Nor peace, nor hope, nor joy, depart.</L>
<L>But yet, whate'er my life may be,</L>
<L>My heart &s;hall &s;till repo&s;e on thee!</L>
<L>To thee, my humble voice I rai&s;e:</L>
<L>Forgive, while I pre&s;ume to prai&s;e!</L>
