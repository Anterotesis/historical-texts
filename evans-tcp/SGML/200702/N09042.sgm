<HEAD>AN HUMBLE ENQUIRY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THOUGH few or none claim infallibility in expre&s;s terms, yet it is very difficult ever to per&s;uade &s;ome men they are mi&s;taken. We generally have &s;o good an opinion of our own under&s;tanding, that in&s;en&s;ibly we take it for granted tho&s;e that do not think as we do mu&s;t needs be in the wrong. When di&s;putes are once heightened by per&s;onal prejudice, or the bitterne&s;s of party, it becomes &s;o much the more difficult to the di&s;putants them&s;elves to &s;ee their mi&s;takes, and e|ven to by&s;tanders the truth appears wrapped up in a cloud, and through the fog and du&s;t of argument becomes almo&s;t impercep|tible.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks I believe will particularly hold good in the &s;ub|ject now in agitation between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her colonies, a &s;ub|ject however of too &s;erious a nature to be given up to prejudice, or to be decided by the rage of party. Every argument <HI>pro</HI> or <HI>con</HI> de&s;erves to be mo&s;t carefully weighed, and he that &s;ets the whole in the cleare&s;t light does the publick no incon&s;iderable &s;ervice, and that whether it be by pointing out the ju&s;tice of the <HI>American</HI> claims to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or &s;etting &s;uch con&s;titutional arguments before the <HI>Americans</HI> as mu&s;t either leave ob&s;tinacy inexcu&s;able, or will di&s;po&s;e loyal and rea&s;onable men to a chearful acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P>The argument on which the <HI>Americans</HI> &s;eem to lay the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s is, they &s;ay that it is a principle of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution that no <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> ought to be taxed but by his own con&s;ent, given ei|ther by him&s;elf or his repre&s;entative. I find it admitted by &s;uch as di&s;approve the <HI>American</HI> claims, that no man is bound by any law to which he hath not given his con&s;ent either in per&s;on or by a re|pre&s;entative. Perhaps the&s;e two propo&s;itions are not perfectly equi|valent; however it &s;eems clear, that he that holds that no man is bound BY ANY LAW to which he has not per&s;onally or by a re|pre&s;entative con&s;ented, mu&s;t al&s;o admit, that no man is bound by any law that lays a tax on him without his con&s;ent given by him&s;elf or repre&s;entative. What is true of ALL laws in general mu&s;t al&s;o. hold true of EVERY law in particular. If no law can operate up|on any man that hath not in the above manner given his a&s;&s;ent to
<PB N="2" REF="011542_0003_0F8725F951F0F0F8">
it, certainly no &s;uch law can be binding upon whole communities, or any con&s;iderable part of the whole nation. In the &s;pirit of the above principle, it &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to law, that it be a&s;&s;ented to by &s;uch on whom it is afterwards to operate. To &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, that a law is binding upon &s;uch as have not given their a&s;&s;ent, is to &s;uppo&s;e (I argue upon that principle) a law may be valid and binding at the &s;ame time it is confe&s;&s;edly de&s;titute of the very e&s;|&s;ential point to make it &s;o; and if the a&s;&s;ent of tho&s;e that are to be governed by the law is not nece&s;&s;ary or e&s;&s;ential to the making of it, then repre&s;entation is a mere &s;uperfluous thing, no better than an excre&s;cence in the legi&s;lative power, which therefore at any con|venient time may be lopped off at plea&s;ure, and without the lea&s;t danger to the con&s;titution; the governed then have no part in the legi&s;lation at all, the will of tho&s;e in power, whoever they be, is the &s;upreme and &s;ole law, and what hath been above a&s;&s;erted to be a con&s;titutional principle &s;eems to me to fall to the ground without remedy to all intents and purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing, on the other hand, that principle, as is a&s;&s;erted to be con&s;titutional, then to me, as is further a&s;&s;erted, it &s;eems to be of the very nature of it, that it be general and hold in all ca&s;es. This it does not only clearly imply, but al&s;o fully and &s;trongly ex|pre&s;s; but yet if &s;o, it would al&s;o &s;eem that no man, or no people, in no ca&s;e, or by no power whatever, can be bound to pay a tax to which they have not con&s;ented either per&s;onally or by their repre|&s;entatives. Every con&s;titutional principle mu&s;t be general and hold in all ca&s;es, and I may add in all places too, for it is u&s;ually &s;aid that the liberties of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> follow him to the end of the world, much more then mu&s;t they follow him over all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> domini|ons; this is &s;o true, that by an expre&s;s law, the children of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parents, though born in a foreign dominion, are ju&s;t as much en|titled to all <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> liberties as tho&s;e who have been born within the realm.</P>
<P>An inference may po&s;&s;ibly hence be drawn, that if &s;o, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> colonies are &s;ubject to none of the acts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, (<HI>&s;cil.</HI> becau&s;e they never a&s;&s;ented to them neither in per&s;on nor by repre&s;entative) and therefore mu&s;t be con&s;idered as independent of the legal or parliamentary power of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> I confe&s;s I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee <HI>America</HI> independent of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and if any of the arguments the <HI>Americans</HI> make u&s;e of imply an independency on the mother &s;tate, I &s;hould &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect there mu&s;t be &s;ome fal|lacy couched under an otherwi&s;e &s;pecious appearance. The &s;um and &s;trength of this inference I conceive lies thus: The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> le|gi&s;lature mu&s;t be the &s;upreme power in all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions, and if &s;o, all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions ought to pay obedience in all ca&s;es to all the laws in which they are mentioned that may be en|acted
<PB N="3" REF="011542_0004_0F8725FA1EF2ED88">
by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, and to refu&s;e obedience in any &s;uch ca&s;e is to declare them&s;elves an independent people.</P>
<P>I freely own I have not heard any thing &s;tronger &s;aid in favour of taxation by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, and I think this argument is highly de&s;erving the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration. Every good man would wi&s;h to hear the voice of di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate rea&s;on before he forms his judgment in any debate. Vulgar prejudices may &s;way vulgar minds, but a wi&s;e man is neither carried away by the torrent of power, nor the bla&s;t of popularity. I would endeavour therefore to con&s;ider this argument with all the can our and impartiality I am capable of; I would do it with a mind open to conviction, and with &s;teadine&s;s &s;ufficient to follow truth wherever &s;he may lead me.</P>
<P>To have a clear view how far this argument may affect the pre|&s;ent que&s;tion between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her colonies, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary carefully to &s;tate the relation which they bear to one ano|ther; without this we &s;hall never have a preci&s;e and determinate idea of the matter. The argument I think is made up of two pro|po&s;itions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is the &s;upreme legi&s;lature in all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions therefore ought to pay obedience there|to in all ca&s;es and to all the laws in which they are mentioned, and to refu&s;e obedience to any &s;uch is to declare them&s;elves an independent people.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to take a di&s;tinct view of each of the&s;e propo&s;i|tions, I repeat, that they are &s;aid to be built upon a con&s;titutional principle, and that this principle mu&s;t be general and hold in all ca&s;es; this mu&s;t undoubtedly be admitted, for what enters into the very e&s;&s;ence of the con&s;titution mu&s;t doubtle&s;s operate as far as the con&s;titution it&s;elf. Let us now proceed to con&s;ider every part of the&s;e two propo&s;itions di&s;tinctly, and this mu&s;t infallibly lead us to form a &s;ound judgment of the whole.</P>
<P>The kingdom of GREAT-BRITAIN con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, north and &s;outh, or <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> united &s;ince 1707 into one kingdom, under the name of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> This union hath not been &s;o full and ab&s;olute, as to put both kingdoms in all re&s;pects upon a perfect equality; but tho' the legi&s;lature is the &s;ame, yet the laws and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice are not the &s;ame in every in&s;tance. The &s;ame legi&s;lature making laws that affect only the one or the other of the&s;e kingdoms, and even laws made to be binding upon both, do not affect both alike, of which the difference in rai&s;ing the &s;up|plies by land tax is a very full and &s;triking proof, this could not be the ca&s;e if the union between the two kingdoms was &s;o entire and ab&s;olute, as for in&s;tance between <HI>England</HI> and the principality of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>The BRITISH EMPIRE is a more exten&s;ive word, and &s;hould not
<PB N="4" REF="011542_0005_0F8725FAD6450CC0">
be confounded with the kingdom or <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; it con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland,</HI> the I&s;lands of <HI>Man, Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Gibraltar,</HI> and <HI>Minorca, &amp;c.</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean; Senegal, &amp;c.</HI> in <HI>Africa; Bombay, &amp;c.</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI>; and the I&s;lands and Colo|nies in <HI>North-America, &amp;c.</HI> As <HI>England,</HI> &s;trictly &s;o called, is at the head of this great body, it is called the mother country; all the &s;et|tled inhabitants of this va&s;t empire are called <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> but indi|viduals, from the place of their nativity or re&s;idence, are called <HI>Engli&s;h, Scotch, Iri&s;h, Welch, Americans, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> were originally di&s;tinct kingdoms and nati|ons, but the colonies in <HI>America,</HI> being &s;ettled upon lands di&s;cover|ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> under charters from the crown of <HI>England,</HI> were always con&s;idered as a part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation, and of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, and looked upon as dependent upon <HI>England</HI>; I mean, that before the union of the two kingdoms, (and very few colonies have been &s;ettled &s;ince) they depended on <HI>England</HI> only, and even now I &s;uppo&s;e are rather con&s;idered as a dependance upon <HI>England</HI> than of the two kingdoms united under the name of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Were it not for the union, which incorporates the two kingdoms, the colonies never would have depended on that part of <HI>Britain</HI> cal|led <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by the terms of the union I apprehend <HI>England</HI> has not given up or brought her colonies under the dominion of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but tho' dependent on <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> they &s;till remain what they always were, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colonies.</P>
<P>All the inhabitants of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire together form the BRI|TISH NATION, and that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament is the &s;upreme power and legi&s;lature in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> nation I never heard doubted.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, which is that which prevails over the whole empire, all <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> or all that make up the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, are entitled to certain privileges indefea&s;ible, unalienable, and of which they can never be deprived, but by the taking away of that con&s;titution which gives them the&s;e privileges. I have ob|&s;erved that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire is made up of different kingdoms and nations, but it is not the original con&s;titution of <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ire|land,</HI> but of <HI>England,</HI> which extends and communicates its privi|leges to the whole empire. This is an undeniable principle, and ought never to be lo&s;t out of &s;ight, if we would form a &s;ound judg|ment on the que&s;tion now to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>From the con&s;ideration above admitted, that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parlia|ment is the &s;upreme legi&s;lative power in the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, the following conclu&s;ion has been drawn; the colonies (and the &s;ame I &s;uppo&s;e is meant of all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, of which the co|lonies are a part) are bound by and &s;ubject to all the laws of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament in which they are mentioned, or are &s;ubject to none of any kind what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="011542_0006_0F8725FB979AFFD0">Before this can be properly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has not only a Parliament, which is the &s;upreme legi&s;|lature, but al&s;o a con&s;titution, and that the now Parliament derives its authority and power from the con&s;titution, and not the con&s;ti|tution from the Parliament. It may al&s;o be very fairly inferred hence, that the liberties of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> ari&s;e from and depend on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, which is permanent and ever the &s;ame, where|as the individuals which compo&s;e the Parliament are changed at lea&s;t once every &s;even years, and always at the demi&s;e of a king.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is the &s;upreme legi&s;lature in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire. It mu&s;t be &s;o either ab&s;olutely or agreeable to the con&s;titution; if ab&s;olutely, it can alter the con&s;titution whenever it &s;ees fit; if ab&s;olutely, it is not bound by the con&s;titution, nor any thing el&s;e; if agreeable to the con&s;titution, then it can no more make laws, which are again&s;t the con&s;titution, or the unalterable privileges of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects, than it can alter the con&s;titution it&s;elf. Suppo&s;ing a Parliament, under &s;ome of the arbitrary reigns of the la&s;t century, &s;hould have made a law, that for the future the king's warrant &s;hould be &s;ufficient to lay a tax on the &s;ubject, or to oblige him to pay &s;hip money, it would have been an act of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature, but it may &s;afely be doubted, whether the nation would have thought it con&s;titutional. I conclude therefore, that the pow|er of Parliament, and of every branch of it, has its bounds a&s;&s;igned by the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If the power of the Parliament is limited by the con&s;titution, it may not be improper next to enquire, whether the power of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament affects all the &s;ubjects of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>If the power of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament affects all the &s;ubjects of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire in the &s;ame manner, it follows, that all the laws made by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament are binding alike upon all tho&s;e o|ver whom this power extends, or in other words, that all the &s;ub|jects of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire are bound not only by tho&s;e laws in which they are expre&s;sly mentioned, but every law by the Parlia|ment made, for what need is there to mention every individual of tho&s;e for whom the law is made in general, every &s;ubject therefore of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, mu&s;t be bound by every law of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, unle&s;s expre&s;sly excepted.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that hold the &s;ubjects of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> living without <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> are bound by every law in which they are men|tioned, &s;eem al&s;o clearly to hold, that the &s;ame per&s;ons are not bound by &s;uch laws in which they are not mentioned. Thus the al|ternative, that the &s;ubjects of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire mu&s;t be &s;ubject to all or none of the laws of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, is limited even by tho&s;e who plead for an univer&s;al &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He that is only bound
<PB N="6" REF="011542_0007_0F8725FC509B1D28">
to obey &s;ome laws, cannot be &s;aid to be bound by all laws, as, on the contrary, he that is bound to obey all laws, is excu&s;ed in none.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, before the union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> none would have &s;crupled to call the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament the &s;upreme legi&s;lature of all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, though <HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;till an independent kingdom, and by the union <HI>Scotland</HI> and its Parliament was not &s;wallowed up and ab&s;orbed by <HI>England</HI> and its Parliament, but unit|ed with the kingdom, and the Parliaments al&s;o of the two kingdoms united in one general legi&s;lature. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws and con|&s;titution al&s;o of each kingdom remains as it was before, <HI>i. e.</HI> entire|ly different from each other.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may not be ami&s;s to conceive, that the authority of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament extends over the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> nation, though the different re&s;pective &s;ubjects are not altogether alike affected by its laws: That, with regard to national trade, the power of mak|ing it mo&s;t beneficial to the head and every branch of the empire is ve&s;ted in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, as the &s;upreme power in the nati|on, and that all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects every where have a right to be ruled by the known principles of their common con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Next, it may be proper to take a nearer view how far, and in what manner, the acts of Parliament operate upon the different &s;ub|jects of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire.</P>
<P>ENGLAND doubtle&s;s is the fir&s;t and primary object of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, and therefore all laws immediately affect every re&s;ident in <HI>England</HI>; and of the king him&s;elf it has been &s;aid, <HI>Rex Angliae in regno &s;uo non habet &s;uperiorem ni&s;i Deum &amp; legem.</HI> Proceedings at law I take to be the &s;ame in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>England</HI>'s dependencies.</P>
<P>SCOTLAND is united with <HI>England,</HI> and therefore there is a diffe|rent operation of the laws that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted before and tho&s;e that have been made &s;ince the union, and even the&s;e do not affect <HI>Scotland</HI> as of them&s;elves; but in con&s;equence of and in the terms of the union between the two nations, the union makes no alteration in proceed|ings at law, nor does it take away any private property.</P>
<P>IRELAND is a di&s;tinct kingdom, and hath been conquered from the native <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> two or three times by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; it hath never|thele&s;s a Parliament of its own, and is a part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire. It will be&s;t appear how far the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament think <HI>Ireland</HI> de|pendent upon <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> by in&s;erting, <HI>A Bill for the better &s;e|curing of the Dependency of</HI> Ireland. The act was as follows: Whereas attempts have lately been made to &s;hake off the &s;ubjection of <HI>Ire|land</HI> unto, and dependence upon the imperial crown of this realm, which will be of dangerous con&s;equence to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> And whereas the Hou&s;e of Lords in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in order thereto, have, of late, again&s;t law, a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves a power and juri&s;diction to examine, correct and amend, the judgment and decrees of the courts of ju&s;tice in the kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI>; therefore, for the bet|ter

&s;peaking the very rever&s;e; but their aver&s;ion to certain new duties, laid upon them for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, have been made a handle of again&s;t them, and they have as good as been charged, that they declare them&s;elves an independent people. The&s;e in&s;inuations the <HI>Americans</HI> are apt to look upon as being neither very fair nor very friendly; however at pre&s;ent I would only con&s;ider what kind of dependence is expected from the <HI>American</HI> colonies. An act of Parliament has fixed that of <HI>Ireland</HI>; a later act of the &s;ame power hath al&s;o fixed that of <HI>America,</HI> though, as will appear from the compari&s;on, not altogether on the &s;ame footing. The act is entitled, <HI>An Act for the better &s;ecuring the De|pendency of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions in</HI> America <HI>upon the Crown and Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, and runs thus:</P>
<P>Whereas &s;everal of the Hou&s;es of Repre&s;entatives in his Maje&s;ty's colonies and plantations in <HI>America</HI> have of late, again&s;t law, claim|ed to them&s;elves, or to the General A&s;&s;emblies of the &s;ame, the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of impo&s;ing duties and taxes upon his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects in the &s;aid colonies and plantations, and, in pur&s;u|ance of &s;uch claim, pa&s;&s;ed certain votes, re&s;olutions and orders, derogatory to the legi&s;lative authority of Parliament, and incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the dependency of the &s;aid colonies and plantations upon the crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> may it therefore plea&s;e your mo&s;t ex|cellent Maje&s;ty, that it may be declared, and be it declared, by the King's mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty, by and with the advice and con|&s;ent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in the pre&s;ent Parliament a&s;&s;embled, and by the authority of the &s;ame. That the &s;aid colonies and plantations in <HI>America</HI> have been, are and of right ought to be, &s;ubordinate unto and dependent upon the imperial crown and Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that the King's Maje&s;ty, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Lords Spiri|tual and Temporal, and Commons, of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in Parliament a&s;&s;embled, had, hath, and of right ought to have, full power and authority to make laws and &s;tatutes of &s;ufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of <HI>America,</HI> &s;ubjects of the crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>And be it further declared and enacted, by the authority afore|&s;aid, That all re&s;olutions, votes, orders and proceedings, in any of the &s;aid colonies or plantations, whereby the power and autho|rity of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to make laws and &s;tatutes as afore&s;aid is denied, or drawn into que&s;tion, are, and are hereby declared to be utterly null and void to all intents and purpo&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This is the &s;tandard of dependence which the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> hath fixed for the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> colonies on the 18th of <HI>March,</HI> 1766. The Stamp Act was repealed the &s;ame day, and the opinion of &s;everal noblemen who prote&s;ted again&s;t that re|peal

was,
<Q>that this declaratory bill cannot po&s;&s;ibly obviate the growing mi&s;chiefs in <HI>America,</HI> where it may &s;eem calculated only to deceive the people of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> by holding forth a de|lu&s;ive and nugatory affirmance of the legi&s;lative right of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> whil&s;t the enacting part of it does no more than abro|gate the re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives in the <HI>North-American</HI> colonies, which have not in them&s;elves the lea&s;t colour of authority, and declares that which is apparently and certainly criminal only null and void.</Q>
I pre&s;ume I may ven|ture to affirm, that in and by this act, the Parliament did not mean to &s;et a&s;ide the con&s;titution, infringe the liberties of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ub|jects, or to vindicate unto them&s;elves an authority which it had not before, was known to have, and would always have had, though this act had never been made. I al&s;o find, that, in order to over&s;et any act, law, re&s;olution, or proceeding, of the colony A&s;&s;emblies, nothing &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, but that the Parliament &s;hould declare it null and void to all intents and purpo&s;es what&s;oever. And it &s;eems pretty clear, that the &s;ame power that can di&s;annul any act by a &s;imple declaration, with one &s;ingle &s;troke more, can al&s;o annihilate the body that made it.</P>
<P>The remark already made, that though all the different parts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire are in a &s;tate of dependence upon the Parli|ament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> yet that the nature and degree of depen|dence is not exactly alike in the re&s;pective different parts of the &s;ame, will receive new &s;trength and light, if we compare the act for better &s;ecuring the dependency of <HI>Ireland</HI> with that for better &s;e|curing the dependency of the colonies. Both acts, though at dif|ferent times, have been made by the &s;ame authority, and for a &s;i|milar purpo&s;e, and none can better tell us what kind and degree of dependency the Parliament expects and requires of its depen|dents than the Parliament it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> is entitled in very general words, for the better &s;ecuring the dependency of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>The title of the <HI>American</HI> law is more explicit; <HI>Ireland</HI>'s depen|dency is mentioned, but the dependency of the <HI>Americans</HI> is more clearly expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;aid to be upon the crown and Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain. America</HI> &s;eems to owe two dependencies, one to the crown, and one to the Parliament.</P>
<P>The preamble of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> bill brings no le&s;s a charge than an attempt to &s;hake off &s;ubjection unto and dependence upon the im|perial crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The preamble of the <HI>American</HI> bill brings no &s;uch accu&s;ation, but only, that the <HI>Americans</HI> have claimed an exclu&s;ive right to lay on taxes on his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects within the colonies, and pa&s;&s;ed votes and re&s;olutions derogatory to the legi&s;lative power of Parlia|ment, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the dependency of the &s;aid colonies

and plantations upon the crown (the word and Parliament is not made u&s;e of in this place) of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> The principal diffe|rences between the&s;e bills &s;eems to me to lie in this, that <HI>Ireland</HI> is &s;aid to be &s;ubject to and dependent only on the crown of <HI>Great-Bri|tain,</HI> whereas <HI>America</HI> throughout is declared &s;ubject, at lea&s;t de|pendent and &s;ubordinate, not only to the crown, but al&s;o to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and then <HI>Ireland</HI> is only declared de|pendent upon, and &s;ubordinate to, in very gentle terms, whereas the right of making laws to bind the <HI>Americans</HI> is expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e very &s;trong, mo&s;t exten&s;ive terms, IN ALL CASES WHATSO|EVER.</P>
<P>Time was when the dependency of the colonies upon <HI>England</HI> was &s;poke of exactly in the terms made u&s;e of for <HI>Ireland</HI>; the char|ter of this province &s;aith, "our plea&s;ure is, that the tenants and inha|bitants of the &s;aid province be &s;ubject IMMEDIATELY to the crown of <HI>England,</HI> as depending thereof forever;" but by the late law all <HI>America</HI> is &s;aid to be dependent on crown and Parliament. This alteration &s;eems to me by no means immaterial, but to imply a change both in the &s;ubjection expected from the colony and in the authority to which the colony owes dependency and &s;ubordination. In Parliament, King, Lords, and Commons, con&s;titute the &s;upreme power; but as each of the&s;e has its own di&s;tinct unalienable right, and incommunicable prerogatives, rights, or privileges, &s;o I can|not but conceive dependency upon the crown and dependency upon crown and Parliament are things not exactly alike. If (as a&s;&s;erted in the charter) the colonies at &s;ome time or other were only depen|dent on the crown, and now are &s;ubordinate unto and dependent upon crown and Parliament, it &s;hould &s;eem both the authority on which they depend, and the nature of their dependency, hath un|dergone &s;ome alteration; neither doth this appear to me a trifling alteration, and it &s;eems to me at lea&s;t if &s;o it mu&s;t needs make &s;ome alteration in the &s;y&s;tem of government and obebience.</P>
<P>Hitherto all appeals from the colonies, after pa&s;&s;ing thro' chancery in <HI>America,</HI> have been made to the King in council; this I con|ceive mu&s;t have been in con&s;equence of the dependency of the co|lonies immediately upon the crown; but perhaps for the future appeals will not be carried to the King in council, but to the King and Parliament.</P>
<P>The crown has hitherto had a right of a negative upon all <HI>Ame|rican</HI> laws, and they were obliged to be pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>America</HI> with a &s;aving clau&s;e; but if, as is a&s;&s;erted in the declaratory bill, the King has a right and power to make laws to bind the <HI>Americans, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>a&s;&s;embled in Parliament,</HI> then probably the &s;ame authority mu&s;t al&s;o concur to repeal the laws made in <HI>America,</HI> whereas the crown hitherto repealed any law made in <HI>A|merica</HI>

without a&s;king or waiting for the con&s;ent of Lords and Commons.</P>
<P>It appears al&s;o, by a late act &s;u&s;pending the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York,</HI> that the parliamentary authority al&s;o extends to &s;u&s;pend, which is but another word for proroguing or di&s;&s;olving (or annihi|lating) A&s;&s;emblies; all which has hitherto been done by the crown without the interfering of Parliament: But that the crown hath a right of proroguing or di&s;&s;olving the Parliament it&s;elf by its own authority I &s;uppo&s;e will not be denied. I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ub|ject without ob&s;erving, that even the declaratory bill &s;peaks of the A&s;&s;emblies in <HI>America</HI> as Hou&s;es of Repre&s;entatives. If it is allowed that they are repre&s;ented in <HI>America,</HI> unle&s;s they are repre&s;ented doubly, they cannot be repre&s;ented any where el&s;e; this &s;trikes at the root of virtual repre&s;entation, and if repre&s;entation is the ba&s;is of taxation, they cannot be taxed but where they are repre&s;ented, unle&s;s they are doubly taxed, as well as doubly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>It is evident upon the whole, that a much greater degree of de|pendency and &s;ubordination is expected of <HI>America</HI> than of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though, by the way, <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the preamble of their bill, is charged with much greater guilt than <HI>America</HI>; nay, the words in ALL CASES WHATSOEVER are &s;o exceeding exten&s;ive, that, in proce&s;s of time, even hewing of wood, and drawing of water, might be argued to be included in them.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the authority claimed by Parliament over <HI>America</HI> as clear and full as po&s;&s;ible; with regard to the <HI>Americans</HI> it mu&s;t be owned, when they profe&s;s to owe dependency and &s;ub|ordination to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, they do not mean &s;o exten&s;ive and ab&s;olute a dependency as here &s;eems to be claimed, but that they think them&s;elves in a con&s;titutional manner dependent upon and in &s;ubordination to the crown and Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> even tho&s;e votes, re&s;olutions, and proceedings, which are di&s;an|nulled by the Hou&s;e of Commons and the declaratory bill, mo&s;t fully and chearfully declare.</P>
<P>It has indeed been &s;aid, that unle&s;s they are &s;ubject to all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> acts in which they are mentioned, they are &s;ubject to none of any kind what&s;oever, and con&s;equently to be con&s;idered as in|dependent of the legal and parliamentary power of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; but I &s;hould think it might be as fairly and &s;afely concluded, that while the <HI>Americans</HI> declare them&s;elves &s;ubject to any one law of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> legi&s;lature, it cannot be &s;aid they declare them&s;elves inde|pendent, or not &s;ubject to any law whatever.</P>
<P>In &s;o delicate and important a matter, may I be permitted to ob&s;erve, that the mea&s;ure of power and of obedience in every coun|try mu&s;t be determined by the &s;tandard of its con&s;titution. The di&s;pute &s;eems to lie between the Parliament and colonies; the Par|liament will certainly be the &s;itting judges; I will not take upon
<PB N="12" REF="011542_0013_0F872607A66A9C28">
me to &s;ay that the <HI>Americans</HI> may not look upon Parliament as judge and party; however, it is very po&s;&s;ible for a judge to give a mo&s;t righteous &s;entence, even where he him&s;elf is deeply intere&s;ted, but they that are &s;ufferers by the &s;entence will ever be apt to wi&s;h that he had not been party as well as judge.</P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid hitherto, the due and con&s;titutional authority of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament appears clear, and it does not le&s;s &s;o I hope, that the &s;ubordination to and dependency on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament is not exactly the &s;ame in all the re&s;pective parts of that exten&s;ive empire; perhaps this will appear with &s;till greater evidence by taking a particular view of the &s;ubject of taxation.</P>
<P>Any unlimited power and authority may lay on the &s;ubjects any tax it plea&s;eth; the &s;ubjects in that ca&s;e them&s;elves are mere pro|perty, and doubtle&s;s their &s;ub&s;tance and labour mu&s;t be at their di&s;po&s;al who have the di&s;po&s;al of their per&s;ons. This is the ca&s;e in arbitrary governments; but the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire is an empire of free|men, no power is ab&s;olute but that of the laws, and, as hath been a&s;&s;erted, of &s;uch laws to which they that are bound by them have them&s;elves con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Did the power and authority of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament in point of taxation extend in the &s;ame manner over all its dependencies, <HI>e. g.</HI> the &s;ame over <HI>Scotland</HI> as over <HI>England,</HI> over <HI>Ireland</HI> in the &s;ame manner as over <HI>Scotland,</HI> over <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> as over <HI>Ireland, &amp;c.</HI> then the very &s;ame act which lays a general tax would lay it al&s;o at the &s;ame time upon all over whom that authority extends. The laws of every legi&s;lature are &s;uppo&s;ed to extend to and be made over all within their juri&s;diction, unle&s;s they are expre&s;sly excepted. Thus an exci&s;e law extends to all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> kingdom, becau&s;e it is a publick law; but acts have frequently been made to lay on a penny <HI>Scots</HI> on beer, which, being for a local purpo&s;e, cannot operate on the whole kingdom. The &s;ame I believe may be &s;aid with regard to the method of recovering &s;mall debts; it &s;eems ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that any &s;upreme legi&s;lature makes an unlimited law which at the &s;ame time is de&s;igned not to be binding upon the greate&s;t part of the &s;ubjects within that empire. Was it ever known that the land tax being laid on the whole united kingdom, the bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> and the manor of <HI>Ea&s;t-Greenwich,</HI> were not al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to be included? and if any part within the immediate juri&s;diction, and equally dependent on the &s;ame legi&s;lature, &s;hould be de&s;igned to be excu&s;ed from, or not liable to pay a general tax, would it not be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch a place &s;hould be expre&s;sly except|ed? If, becau&s;e <HI>America</HI> is a part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, it is as much &s;o, or in the &s;ame manner is a part of it, as is the bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> or the manor of <HI>Ea&s;t-Greenwich,</HI> nothing can be plainer than that it mu&s;t be affected by every tax that is laid ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner and proportion as is the bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> or manor
<PB N="13" REF="011542_0014_0F872608551EA590">
<HI>Ea&s;t-Greenwich.</HI> This hath not been the ca&s;e, nor thought to be the ca&s;e hitherto. <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>America</HI> have not been called upon to pay the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> land tax, malt tax, nor indeed any tax in which they have not been expre&s;sly mentioned; the rea&s;on of which I pre|&s;ume mu&s;t be, either that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament did not look upon them as any part of the kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or el&s;e did not think them liable to any tax in which they were not expre&s;sly men|tioned. If any &s;ubjects of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire are not liable to any or every tax laid on by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, it mu&s;t be either be|cau&s;e they are not liable by the con&s;titution, (as not being repre|&s;ented) or becau&s;e they are excu&s;ed by the favour of Parliament; if they are not liable by the privileges of the con&s;titution, their not being compelled to pay is no favour, the contrary would be op|pre&s;&s;ion and an anticon&s;titutional act; if they have been hitherto excu&s;ed by the lenity of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, it mu&s;t be owned the Parliament bore harder on tho&s;e who were made to pay tho&s;e taxes than on tho&s;e who by their lenity only were excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The noble Lords who prote&s;ted again&s;t the repeal of the Stamp Act ob&s;erve,
<Q>it appears to us, that a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of that authority, (<HI>&s;c.</HI> the whole legi&s;lative authority of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> without any di&s;tinction or re&s;erve what&s;oever) the power of le|gi&s;lation, cannot be properly, equitably, or impartially exerci&s;|ed, if it does not extend it&s;elf to all the members of the &s;tate in proportion to their re&s;pective abilities, but &s;uffers a part to be exempt from a due &s;hare of tho&s;e burdens which the publick exigencies require to be impo&s;ed upon the whole: A partiality which is directly and manife&s;tly repugnant to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed by the people in every legi&s;lature, and de&s;tructive of that confi|dence on which all government is founded.</Q></P>
<P>If in the opinion of the&s;e Noblemen, therefore, it is partiality to &s;uffer any part of the &s;tate to be exempt from a due &s;hare of tho&s;e burdens which the publick exigencies require &s;hould be im|po&s;ed upon the WHOLE, it would al&s;o &s;eem to be a &s;pecies of partia|lity, to lay a burden on ANY PART of the &s;tate which the other parts of the &s;ame &s;tate are not equally bound to bear. Partial burdens, or partial exemptions, would doubtle&s;s affect tho&s;e that are bur|dened or exempted in a very different manner; but if not extend|ing alike to the whole, mu&s;t &s;till be looked upon as partial. And if this partiality is incon&s;i&s;tent with the tru&s;t <HI>repo&s;ed BY THE PEOPLE in every legi&s;lature,</HI> it would al&s;o &s;eem that the legi&s;lature could not lay any burdens but as entru&s;ted by the people who cho&s;e them to be their repre&s;entatives and a part of the legi&s;lature. We may hence al&s;o learn what is to be expected, if every other part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> only excepted, have hitherto been exempted from the taxes paid in <HI>England,</HI> which it mu&s;t be owned are very heavy, by mere favour; or, as &s;ome &s;eem to expre&s;s

it, "<HI>flagrant partiality and inju&s;tice</HI>;" their being indulged time im|memorial will not be deemed a &s;ufficient plea to excu&s;e them al|ways, but with an impartial hand the very &s;ame taxes that now ob|tain in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will be laid upon <HI>Ireland, America, Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey,</HI> the <HI>Mediterranean, African</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> &s;ettlements, and, in &s;hort, on every individual part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire.

<P>There are &s;everal parts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire that pay no tax at all; this I take to be the ca&s;e of <HI>Gibraltar, Minorca, Newfoundland, Ea&s;t-Florida,</HI> and all the <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> &s;ettlements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The rea&s;on is, that all the&s;e places have no legi&s;lature of their own, and con&s;equently none to give or di&s;po&s;e of their property; had the&s;e places been taxed by Parliament, there might however this rea&s;on been given, that having no repre&s;entatives within them&s;elves, and having never contributed any thing to the publick burdens, though they all receive protection, perhaps greater than the <HI>Ame|rican</HI> colonies, the Parliament &s;upplied that detect; but this cannot be urged again&s;t the colonies, who both have legi&s;latures, and al&s;o contributed to the publick burdens, and that &s;o liberally, that even the crown and Parliament thought they had exerted them&s;elves be|yond their abilities, and for &s;everal years gave them &s;ome compen&s;ation. I may mention tho&s;e parts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire as &s;triking in&s;tances, that where there is no repre&s;entation, taxation hath not been thought of, and yet <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> which is not taxed at all, is certainly as much repre&s;ented in Parliament as all the colonies, which are de|&s;igned to be doubly taxed.</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution taxes are in the nature of a free gift of the &s;ubjects to the crown; regulations of trade are mea&s;ures to &s;ecure and improve the trade of the whole nation. There is no doubt but regulations may be made to ruin as well as to improve trade; yet without regulations trade cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but mu&s;t &s;uffer and &s;ink; and it &s;eems no where more proper to lodge the power of making the&s;e regulations than in the highe&s;t court of the empire; yet a man may trade or not, he may buy or let it alone; if merchandizes are rated &s;o high that they will not &s;uit him to purcha&s;e, though it may be an inconvenience, yet there is no law to compel him to buy; to rate the nece&s;&s;aries of life, without which a man cannot well do, beyond their real value, and hinder him at the &s;ame time from pur|cha&s;ing them rea&s;onably of others, is &s;carce con&s;i&s;tent with free|dom; but when duties are laid on merchandizes not to regulate trade, but for the expre&s;s and &s;ole purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, they are to all intents and purpo&s;es equal to any tax, but they can
<PB N="15" REF="011542_0016_0F872609F632AA10">
by no means be called the free gift of tho&s;e who never helped to make the law, but, as far as in them lay, ever looked upon it as an uncon&s;titutional grievance.</P>
<P>If taxes are a free GIFT of the people to the crown, then the crown hath no right to them but what is derived from the GIVERS. It may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;ubject &s;hould give, but &s;till he that is to give mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed the judge both of that nece&s;&s;ity, and how much he may be able and ought to give upon every ne|ce&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion. No man can give what is not his own, and there|fore the con&s;titution hath placed this right to judge of the nece&s;&s;ity, and of what is to be given, in the Commons as the repre&s;entatives of all tho&s;e who are to give, in ve&s;ting a right in them to give pub|lick &s;upplies to the crown; it did not, could not mean to inve&s;t them with any power to give what neither belongs to them, nor tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent; and therefore, as no man con&s;titutio|nally "owes obedience to any law to which he has not a&s;&s;ented either in per&s;on or by his repre&s;entative;" much le&s;s doth the con&s;titution oblige any man to part with his property, but freely and by his own con&s;ent; what tho&s;e who are repre&s;entatives are not willing to give, no power in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> hath any right violently to take, and for a man to have his property took from him under pretence of a law that is not con&s;titutional, would not be much better than to have it took from him again&s;t the expre&s;s con&s;ent of tho&s;e whom he con&s;titutionally made his repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>It is held a maxim, that in government a proportion ought to be ob&s;erved between the &s;hare in the legi&s;lature and the burden to be borne. The <HI>Americans</HI> pretend to no &s;hare in the legi&s;lature of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> at all, but they hope they have never forfeited their &s;hare in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Every government &s;uppo&s;es rule and protection from the gover|nors, &s;upport and obedience from tho&s;e that are governed; from the&s;e duly tempered ari&s;es the prerogative of the crown and the li|berty of the &s;ubject; but he that has not a right to his own hath no property, and he that mu&s;t part with his property by laws again&s;t his con&s;ent, or the con&s;ent of the majority of the people, has no liberty. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution is made to &s;ecure liberty and pro|perty; whatever takes away the&s;e takes away the con&s;titution it|&s;elf, and cannot be con&s;titutional.</P>
<P>To form a clear judgment on the power of taxation, it mu&s;t be enquired on what right that power is grounded. It is a fundamen|tal maxim of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> law, that there is a contract between the crown and &s;ubjects; if &s;o, the crown cannot lay on any tax, or any other burden, on the &s;ubject, but agreeable to the original contract by authority of Parliament; neither can the Lords properly concur, or the Commons frame a tax bill for any other purpo&s;e but the &s;up|port
<PB N="16" REF="011542_0017_0F87260AAE869D30">
of the crown and government, con&s;i&s;tent with the original contract between that and the people.</P>
<P>All &s;ubjects are dependent on and &s;ubordinate to the government under which they live. An <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> in <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t ob&s;erve the laws of <HI>France</HI>; but it cannot be &s;aid that the dependency and &s;ub|ordination in <HI>England</HI> is the &s;ame as dependency and &s;ubordination in <HI>France.</HI> In governments where the will of the &s;overeign is the &s;upreme law, the &s;ubjects have nothing to give, their ALL is in the di&s;po&s;al of the government; there &s;ubjects pay, but having nothing of their own cannot give; but in <HI>England</HI> the Commons GIVE and GRANT. This implies both a free and voluntary act, and that they give nothing but their own property.</P>
<P>Though every part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire is bound to &s;upport and promote the advantage of the whole, it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary that this &s;hould be done by a tax indi&s;criminately laid on the whole; it &s;eems &s;ufficient that every part &s;hould contribute to the &s;upport of the whole as it may be be&s;t able, and as may be&s;t &s;uit with the com|mon con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I have before ob&s;erved the different degree of dependency on the mother &s;tate; I &s;hall now review the &s;ame again, with a particular regard to impo&s;ing or paying taxes, and if a material difference hath always obtained in this re&s;pect, it will confirm my a&s;&s;ertion, that every branch of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire is not affected by the tax laws of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the &s;elf &s;ame manner.</P>
<P><HI>The Parliament has a right to tax,</HI> but this right is not inherent in the members of it as men; I mean, the members of Parliament are not (like the Senate of <HI>Venice</HI>) &s;o many rulers who have each of them a native and inherent right to be the rulers of the people of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> or even their repre&s;entatives; they do not meet together as a court of proprietors to con&s;ider their common intere&s;t, and agree with one another what tax they will lay on tho&s;e over whom they bear rule, or whom they repre&s;ent, but they only exerci&s;e that right which nature hath placed in the people in general, and which, as it can|not conveniently be exerci&s;ed by the whole people, THESE have lodged in &s;ome of their body cho&s;en from among them&s;elves, and by them&s;elves, for that purpo&s;e, and empowered for a time only to tran&s;act the affairs of the whole, and to agree in their behalf on &s;uch &s;upplies as it may be nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h unto the crown for the &s;upport of its dignity, and the nece&s;&s;ities and protection of the people.</P>
<P>It would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that the crown hath a right to lay on a tax, for as taxes are granted to the crown, &s;o in this ca&s;e the crown would make a grant to it&s;elf, and hence the bill of rights expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts, that <HI>the levying of money for or to the u&s;e of the crown, by pre|tence of prerogative, without grant of Parliament, for a longer time or
<PB N="17" REF="011542_0018_0F87260B51EB8640">
in any other manner than the &s;ame is or &s;hall be granted, is illegal</HI>; hence al&s;o there is a material difference between money bills and all other laws. The King and Lords cannot make any amendment in mo|ney bills, as the Hou&s;e of Lords frequently doth in all others, but mu&s;t accept or refu&s;e them &s;uch as they are offered by the Com|mons, the con&s;titutional rea&s;on of which is very obvious, it is the people only that give, and therefore giving mu&s;t be the &s;ole act of tho&s;e by whom the givers are repre&s;ented. The crown cannot take till it is given, and they that give cannot give but on their own be|half, and of tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent; nay even then they cannot give but in a con&s;titutional manner; they cannot give the property of tho&s;e they repre&s;ent without giving their own al&s;o exactly in the &s;ame proportion; every bill mu&s;t be equally binding upon ALL whom they repre&s;ent, and upon every one that is a repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>Every repre&s;entative in Parliament is not a repre&s;entative for the whole nation, but only for the particular place for which he hath been cho&s;en. If any are cho&s;en for a plurality of places, they can make their election only for one of them. The electors of <HI>Middle|&s;ex</HI> cannot chu&s;e a repre&s;entative but for <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> and as the right of &s;itting depends entirely upon the election, it &s;eems clear to de|mon&s;tration, that no member can repre&s;ent any but tho&s;e by whom he hath been elected; if not elected he cannot repre&s;ent them, and of cour&s;e not con&s;ent to any thing in their behalf. While <HI>Great-Britain</HI>'s repre&s;entatives do not &s;it a&s;&s;embled in Parliament, no tax whatever can be laid by any power on <HI>Great-Britain</HI>'s inhabitants; it is plain therefore, that without repre&s;entation there can be no taxation. If repre&s;entation ari&s;es entirely from the free election of the people, it is plain that the elected are not repre&s;entatives in their own right, but by virtue of their election; and it is not le&s;s &s;o, that the electors cannot confer any right on tho&s;e whom they elect but what is inherent in them&s;elves; the electors of <HI>London</HI> cannot confer or give any right to their members to lay a tax on <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter,</HI> but the election made of them doubtle&s;s empowers them to a|gree to or differ from any mea&s;ures they think agreeable or di&s;a|greeable to their con&s;tituents, or the kingdom in general. If the repre&s;entatives have no right but what they derive from their elec|tors and election, and if the electors have no right to elect any re|pre&s;entatives but for them&s;elves, and if the right of &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of Commons ari&s;es only from the election of tho&s;e de&s;igned to be repre&s;entatives, it is undeniable, that the power of taxation in the Hou&s;e of Commons cannot extend any further than to tho&s;e who have delegated them for that purpo&s;e; and if none of the e|lectors in <HI>England</HI> could give a power to tho&s;e whom they elected to repre&s;ent or tax any other part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions except them&s;elves, it mu&s;t follow, that when the Commons are met, they repre&s;ent no other place or part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions, and
<PB N="18" REF="011542_0019_0F87260C1571E9F8">
cannot give away the property but of tho&s;e who have given them a power &s;o to do by choo&s;ing them their repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>The Parliament hath the &s;ole right to lay on taxes, and, as hath been ob&s;erved in Parliament, 'tis not the King and Lords that GIVE and GRANT, but this is the &s;ole act of the Commons. The Commons have the right to do &s;o either from the crown or people, or it is a right inherent in them&s;elves. It cannot be inhe|rent in them&s;elves, for they are not born repre&s;entatives, but are &s;o by election, and that not for life, but only for a certain time; neither can they derive it from the crown, el&s;e the liberty and pro|perty of the &s;ubject mu&s;t be entirely in the di&s;po&s;al and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown; but if they hold it entirely from the people, they cannot hold it from any other people but tho&s;e who have cho&s;en them to be their repre&s;entatives, and it &s;hould &s;eem they cannot extend their power of taxing beyond the limits of time and place, nor indeed for any other purpo&s;e but that for which they have been cho&s;en. As the Commons in Parliament cannot lay any tax but what they mu&s;t pay them&s;elves, and falls equally on the whole kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o, by a fundamental law, they cannot lay but &s;uch a part of the general tax on &s;ome part of the united king|dom. The principality of <HI>Wales</HI> was never taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated and repre&s;ented, and, poor as it is, it pays now con&s;iderably larger than <HI>Scotland,</HI> which is as big again. When <HI>England</HI> is taxed two millions in the land tax, no more is paid in <HI>Scotland</HI> than 48,000<HI>l.</HI> and yet to lay a higher land tax on <HI>North Bri|tain</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament cannot, it cannot without breaking the union, that is, a fundamental law of the kingdom. All the right it hath to tax <HI>Scotland</HI> ari&s;es from and mu&s;t be executed in the terms of the union. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>While <HI>Scotland</HI> was yet a &s;eparate kingdom, it was once debated in Parlia|ment, whether a &s;ub&s;idy &s;hould fir&s;t be granted, or overtures for liberty fir&s;t be con&s;idered; when the Queen's Mini&s;try in&s;i&s;ted on the former, a member urged, that it was now plain the nation was to expect no return for their expence and toil, but to be put to the charge of a &s;ub&s;idy, and to lay down their necks under the yoke of &s;lavery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Another member &s;aid, that he in&s;i&s;ted for having a vote upon the que&s;tion which had been put: That he found as the liberties of the na|tion were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, &s;o the privileges of Parliament were like to be torn from them, but that he would rather venture his life than that it &s;hould be &s;o, and &s;hould chu&s;e rather <HI>to die a freeman</HI> than <HI>live a &s;lave.</HI> Some pre&s;&s;ed for the vote, adding, that if there was no other way of obtaining &s;o natural and undeniable a privilege of the Parliament, <HI>they would demand it with their &s;words in their hands.</HI></P>

<P>The I&s;lands of <HI>Guern&s;ey, &amp;c.</HI> are not taxed by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parlia|ment at all, they &s;till have their own States, and I never heard that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament ever-offered to hinder them to lay on their own taxes, or to lay on additional ones, where they are not repre&s;ented.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="011542_0020_0F87260CD9E30F58"><HI>Ireland</HI> is a conquered kingdom, the greater part of its inhabitants <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> who in <HI>England</HI> pay double tax. The <HI>Romans</HI> always made a difference between their colonies and their conque&s;ts, and as rea|&s;onable, allowed greater and indeed all common liberties to the former. <HI>Ireland</HI> hath been conquered twice again upon the natives &s;ince its fir&s;t conque&s;t, neverthele&s;s it hitherto had its own legi&s;|lature; if the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> claims a right to tax them, they never yet have made u&s;e of that right, and &s;eeing for ages pa&s;t they enjoyed the privilege of having their own property di&s;|po&s;ed of by repre&s;entatives in a Parliament of their own, it is very natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that they think them&s;elves entitled to the&s;e things, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e, in the very bill that determines their dependency, they are not &s;aid to be dependent on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, nor yet on crown and Parliament, but only on the crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>I would now proceed to take a di&s;tinct view of the point in de|bate between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her colonies.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be a prevailing opinion in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that the Parliament hath a right to tax the <HI>Americans,</HI> and that, unle&s;s they have &s;o, <HI>America</HI> would be independent of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>And it &s;eems to be a prevailing opinion in <HI>America,</HI> that to be taxed without their con&s;ent, and where they are not and cannot be repre&s;ented, would deprive them of the rights of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> nay, in time, with the lo&s;s of the con&s;titution, would deprive them of li|berty and property altogether.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ily &s;een, that this is a very intere&s;ting &s;ubject, the con&s;e|quences in each ca&s;e very important, though in neither &s;o alarming and dangerous to <HI>Britain</HI> as to <HI>America.</HI> With regard to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> if it &s;hould not prove &s;o as is claimed, the con&s;equence can only be this, that then no tax can be laid, or revenue be rai&s;ed, on the <HI>A|mericans,</HI> but where they are repre&s;ented, and in a manner which they think con&s;i&s;tent with their natural rights as men, and with their civil and con&s;titutional liberties as <HI>Britons.</HI> The dependency of <HI>America</HI> upon <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will be as full and firm as ever, and they will chearfully comply with the requi&s;itions of the crown in a con&s;titutional manner. The que&s;tion is not, whether the <HI>Americans</HI> will withdraw their &s;ubordination, or refu&s;e their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but, whether they them&s;elves &s;hall give their own property, where they are legally repre&s;ented, or, whether the Parliament of <HI>Great-Bri|tain,</HI> which does not repre&s;ent them, &s;hall take their property, and di&s;po&s;e of it in the &s;ame manner as they do theirs whom in Parlia|ment they actually repre&s;ent. The <HI>Americans</HI> do not plead for a right to withhold, but freely and chearfully to give. If 100,000<HI>l.</HI> are to be rai&s;ed, the que&s;tion is not, &s;hall they be rai&s;ed or no? but &s;hall the Parliament levy &s;o much upon the <HI>Americans,</HI> and order
<PB N="20" REF="011542_0021_0F8A2013B73550E8">
them to pay it, as a gift and grant of the Commons of <HI>Great-Bri|tain</HI> to the King? or, &s;hall the <HI>Americans</HI> al&s;o have an opportunity to &s;hew their loyalty and readine&s;s to &s;erve the King by freely grant|ing it to the King them&s;elves? It is not to be denied the <HI>Americans</HI> apprehend, that if any power, no matter what the name, where they are not repre&s;ented, hath a right to lay a tax on them at plea|&s;ure, all their liberty and property is at an end, and they are upon a level with the meane&s;t &s;laves.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> will not lo&s;e a &s;hilling in point of property; the rights and privileges of the good people of <HI>Britain</HI> will not be in the lea&s;t affected, &s;uppo&s;ing the claim of the <HI>Americans</HI> ju&s;t and to take place; whereas every thing dreadful appears in view to the <HI>Ame|ricans</HI> if it &s;hould turn out otherwi&s;e. The crown cannot lo&s;e; the <HI>Americans</HI> are as willing to comply with every con&s;titutional requi|&s;ition as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament it&s;elf can po&s;&s;ibly be. The Parlia|ment cannot lo&s;e, it will &s;till have all the power and authority it hitherto had, and ought to have had, and when every branch of the legi&s;lature, and every member of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, has a true regard to reciprocal duty, prerogative and privilege, the happine&s;s of the whole is be&s;t likely to be &s;ecured and promoted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Americans</HI> mo&s;t &s;olemnly di&s;claim every thought, and the very idea of independency; they are &s;ometimes afraid they are charged with a de&s;ire of it, not becau&s;e this appears to be the real ca&s;e, but to &s;et their arguments in an invidious light, and to make them appear odious in the &s;ight of their mother country. This is not a di&s;pute about a punctilio, the difference in the con&s;equence is amazingly great; &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>America</HI> is not taxed where not repre|&s;ented, and &s;uppo&s;ing things are left upon the &s;ame footing in which with manife&s;t advantage to <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America</HI> they have been ever &s;ince <HI>Britain</HI> had colonies, neither the trade nor authority of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;uffers the lea&s;t diminution, but the mi&s;chief to the colonies is be|yond all expre&s;&s;ion, if the contrary &s;hould take place. If they are not to rai&s;e their own taxes, all their A&s;&s;emblies become u&s;ele&s;s in a moment, all their re&s;pective legi&s;latures are annihilated at a &s;troke; an act pa&s;&s;ed by per&s;ons, mo&s;t of whom probably never &s;aw, nor cared much for <HI>America,</HI> may de&s;troy all the acts they ever pa&s;&s;ed, may lay every burden upon them under which they are not ex|pected immediately to &s;ink, and all their civil and religious liber|ties, for which their forefathers went into this wilderne&s;s, and, under the &s;miles of Heaven, turned it into a garden, and of im|men&s;e con&s;equence to the mother country, will, or may be at an end at once. Probably the pre&s;ent Parliament or generation would never carry matters to this length, but who knows what might be done in the next? The fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the <HI>American</HI> wilds never ex|pected that would come to pa&s;s what we have &s;een already. It &s;eems as if &s;ome evil genius had prevailed of late; had the&s;e new

duties been laid on payable in <HI>England,</HI> at lea&s;t the expence of a Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, and of the &s;warms of new officers, might have been prevented; but it looks as though &s;ome men wi&s;hed that <HI>America</HI> might not only be borne hard upon, but al&s;o be made to know and feel that their liberty and property lay at the mercy of others, and that they mu&s;t not flatter them&s;elves to enjoy them any longer than the good plea&s;ure of &s;ome who would willingly take a|way what <HI>they</HI> never did give. I have endeavoured candidly to &s;tate the que&s;tion, let us now endeavour to view the claim made on each &s;ide as calmly and impartially as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament hath a right to tax the <HI>Americans.</HI> If this propo&s;ition is incontrovertible, it mu&s;t certainly be built on &s;uch a ba&s;is and &s;uch clear principles as will be &s;ufficient to di&s;po&s;e loyal and rea&s;onable men chearfully to acquie&s;ce in it. There are &s;ome points in government which perhaps are be&s;t never touched upon, but when any que&s;tion once becomes the &s;ubject of publick debate, &s;trength of rea&s;on is the &s;ole authority that with men of rea&s;on can determine the matter.</P>
<P>If the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have a right to tax the <HI>Americans,</HI> it mu&s;t either be the &s;ame right in virtue of which they have a right to tax <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and be ve&s;ted in them by the &s;ame power, or it mu&s;t be a di&s;tinct right either inherent in them&s;elves, or ve&s;ted in them by &s;ome other power.</P>
<P>The right of the Commons of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to lay on taxes ari&s;es, as I conceive, from their having been cho&s;en by the people who are to pay the&s;e taxes to act in their behalf and as their repre&s;enta|tives. There may be other qualifications nece&s;&s;ary, that a man be a <HI>Briton</HI> born, &s;ubject of the King, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a certain e&s;tate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but none is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary as election. He that hath been a repre&s;entative had a right to refu&s;e or concur in any tax bill whil&s;t a member, but if he is not cho&s;en again in a following Parliament, he hath no right whatever to meddle in the matter; this proves that the power is originally in the people, and the legi&s;lative capa|city of the whole Hou&s;e, and of every member, depends upon their free election, and is of force no longer than for the time for which they have been elected; this being elap&s;ed, the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them entirely cea&s;es, it ab&s;olutely returns to the body of the people; in that interval during which the people are unrepre&s;ented, any power their representatives might have is entirely and &s;olely in the people them&s;elves, no tax can be laid on, nor any law to bind the people be formed, for this plain rea&s;on, becau&s;e there are no per&s;ons qua|lified for the purpo&s;e. The people have not repre&s;entatives a&s;&s;ign|ed, but chu&s;e them, and being &s;o cho&s;en, the rights of the people re&s;ide now in them, and they may, but not before, act in their behalf. Now, when the crown i&s;&s;ues writs of election, it is not to
<PB N="22" REF="011542_0023_0F87260F62637B68">
empower the electors to chu&s;e repre&s;entatives for <HI>America,</HI> nor yet for all <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but only for &s;ome certain place &s;pecified in the writ; and when the electors of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> chu&s;e repre&s;entatives, their meaning al&s;o is not to chu&s;e repre&s;entatives for their fellow &s;ubjects in <HI>America,</HI> or any where el&s;e, but for them&s;elves. In <HI>Great-Britain Engli&s;h</HI> electors cannot elect in behalf of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> electors cannot in behalf of <HI>England</HI>; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on neither <HI>Scotch</HI> nor <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> can elect any for <HI>America.</HI> The&s;e electors do not repre&s;ent the <HI>Americans,</HI> nor are they their proxies to vote in members in their behalf; neither can <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> electors give any in&s;tructions to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> repre&s;entatives, or inve&s;t them with any power to di&s;po&s;e of the rights and property of any of their fellow &s;ubjects without the kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> It &s;eems not unrea&s;onable then to conclude, that the right which the elected acquire by their election to pa&s;s tax laws binding upon their electors does not at the &s;ame time give them a right to repre&s;ent and lay on taxes on tho&s;e who never inve&s;ted them with any &s;uch power, and by whom they neither were nor could be elected. If the <HI>Americans</HI> them&s;elves are not received as voters in the bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> manor of <HI>Ea&s;t Greenwich,</HI> or any place mentioned in their charters, and the &s;ame liberty and privileges with tho&s;e places therein &s;ecured unto them, if they are not allowed to chu&s;e any repre&s;entatives for them|&s;elves in the Hou&s;e of Commons, it &s;eems natural, that what they have no right to do them&s;elves, none can have a right to do for them, and &s;o no body can chu&s;e or &s;end a repre&s;entative for them to any place where they are not allowed to &s;it or be repre&s;ented. If &s;o, the electors of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> never in fact elected repre&s;entatives for <HI>America,</HI> nor could the&s;e electors po&s;&s;ibly convey any power to give away property where they have no property them&s;elves. The electors do not repre&s;ent <HI>America,</HI> neither their repre&s;entatives by them elected; the electors cannot di&s;po&s;e of the property of <HI>Ameri|ca,</HI> therefore they cannot give a power &s;o to do unto others. In <HI>England</HI> there can be no taxation without repre&s;entation, and no re|pre&s;entation without election; but it is undeniable that the repre|&s;entatives of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> are not elected by nor for the <HI>Americans,</HI> and therefore cannot repre&s;ent them; and &s;o, if the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has a right to tax <HI>America,</HI> that right cannot po&s;&s;ibly be grounded on the con&s;ideration that the people of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have cho&s;en them their repre&s;entatives, without which choice they would be no Parliament at all.</P>
<P>If the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has a right to tax the <HI>Americans</HI> di&s;tinct from the right which they derive from their electors, and which they exerci&s;e as the repre&s;entatives of the people of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> then this right they mu&s;t hold either from the crown, or from the <HI>Americans,</HI> or el&s;e it mu&s;t be a native inherent right in
<PB N="23" REF="011542_0024_0F87260FD9876680">
them&s;elves, at lea&s;t a con&s;equence of their being repre&s;entatives of the people of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It is plain that the colonies have been &s;ettled by authority and under the &s;anction of the crown, but as the crown did not re&s;erve unto it&s;elf a right to rule over them without their own A&s;&s;emblies, but on the contrary e&s;tabli&s;hed legi&s;latures among them, as it did not re&s;erve a right to lay taxes on them in a manner which, were the experiment made in <HI>England,</HI> might be thought uncon&s;titu|tional, &s;o neither do I find that a re&s;erve of that kind was made by the crown in favour of the Parliament, on the contrary, by the charters all the inhabitants were promi&s;ed the enjoyment of the &s;ame and all privileges of his Maje&s;ty's liege &s;ubjects in <HI>England,</HI> of which doubtle&s;s not to be taxed where they are not repre&s;ented is one of the principal. As to any right that might accrue to Parliament from any act or &s;urrender of the <HI>Americans,</HI> I believe it hath never been thought of; they have a profound veneration for the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, they look upon it as the great palladium of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> liberties, but &s;till they are not the&s;e repre&s;ented, they have had their own legi&s;latures and repre&s;entatives for ages pa&s;t, and as a body cannot be more than in one place at once, they think they cannot be legally repre&s;ented in more than one legi&s;lative body, but al&s;o think, that by the laws of <HI>England Prote&s;tants</HI> ought not to be doubly taxed, or, what they think wor&s;e, taxed in two places.</P>
<P>If therefore this right of taxing the <HI>Americans</HI> re&s;ides in the Com|mons of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> at all, it mu&s;t be an inherent right in them|&s;elves, or at lea&s;t in con&s;equence of their being repre&s;entatives of the people of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> The act for better &s;ecuring the depen|dency of the colonies, which I have in&s;erted at large, evidently &s;eems to tend this way. That the colonies were thought at the di&s;po&s;al of Parliament one might be led to think, becau&s;e by that act, from the &s;imple authority of the crown, which they were till then &s;ubject to by their charters, they were now declared to be &s;ub|ordinate to and dependent (on the joint authority) of crown and Parliament. Yet, concerning this act, I would only ob&s;erve, that however it may determine the ca&s;e from that day, it cannot be the ground on which the &s;ubordination of the colonies originally WAS or now can be built; for it declares not only, that the colonies ARE AND OUGHT TO BE, but al&s;o that they ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, &s;ubject to crown and Parliament. A law binds after it is made, it cannot bind before it exi&s;ts, and &s;o &s;urely it cannot be &s;aid, that the colonies have <HI>always</HI> been bound by a law which is above a hundred years po&s;terior to them in point of exi&s;tence. It is al&s;o a little difficult to reconcile this law with prior charters; our <HI>Carolina</HI> charter makes our province &s;ubject immediately to the crown, and near a hundred years after a law is made to declare, that this was
<PB N="24" REF="011542_0025_0F8726109DD8B388">
not and mu&s;t not be the ca&s;e, but that the <HI>Americans</HI> always were and ought to be &s;ubject to crown and Parliament. Perhaps this hath not been &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered as it may hereafter, but neither this nor any law can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be binding <HI>ex po&s;t facto,</HI> or contrary to our fundamental con&s;titution. <HI>Monte&s;quieu</HI> ob&s;erves, that the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution (which God pre&s;erve) will be lo&s;t, whenever the le|gi&s;lative power &s;hall be more corrupted than the executive part of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>And after all, in this very law, the <HI>Americans</HI> are allowed to be repre&s;ented in their own A&s;&s;emblies, and to lay on duties and taxes, though not exclu&s;ively; but whether <HI>America,</HI> or any part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, &s;hould be liable to have taxes impo&s;ed on them by different legi&s;latures, and whether the&s;e would not frequently cla&s;h with one another to the detriment of crown and &s;ubjects, I leave others duly to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, if <HI>America</HI> cannot be taxed by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, then it would be independent of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> This is now a very popular cry, and it is well if many join in it only becau&s;e they know no better. This is not, will not, cannot be the ca&s;e. <HI>America</HI> con|fe&s;&s;edly hath not been thus taxed &s;ince it was &s;ettled; but no body in <HI>Britain</HI> or <HI>America</HI> ever dreamed that <HI>America</HI> was independent. In <HI>England</HI> the people cannot be taxed when the Parliament does not &s;it, or when it is di&s;&s;olved; are they then therefore indepen|dent. <HI>Scotland</HI> cannot be taxed in the &s;ame degree as <HI>England</HI>; is it therefore independent? <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> have their own legi&s;la|tures, and &s;o tax them&s;elves; will you call them independent? All tho&s;e parts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire that have no A&s;&s;emblies pay no taxes at all, neither among them&s;elves, nor to <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; but it will not therefore be &s;aid, that they are independent. The Parliament it&s;elf claims a right to refu&s;e &s;upplies till their grievances are heard and redre&s;&s;ed, this is looked upon as a con&s;titutional remedy a|gain&s;t any encroachments by the crown, and hath very often been made u&s;e of in former reigns, and yet the Parliament neither claimed nor were charged with a de&s;ire of independency. Tho&s;e who &s;o freely charge with a de&s;ire of independency, and even trea&s;on and rebellion, would do well to con&s;ider, that this charge, heinous as it is, reflects greater di&s;grace on tho&s;e who unju&s;tly make it, than on tho&s;e on whom it is unju&s;tly made. A man of honour would not ea&s;ily forgive him&s;elf whenever he &s;hould di&s;cover that he made &s;o ra&s;h a charge again&s;t two millions of people, as innocent, loyal, and well affected to their King and country, as any of his fellow &s;ubjects or him&s;elf po&s;&s;ibly can be. There never was an <HI>American Jacobite,</HI> the very air of <HI>America</HI> is death to &s;uch mon&s;ters, never any grew there, and if any are tran&s;ported, or import them&s;elves, lo&s;s of &s;peech always attends them. The loyalty of the <HI>Americans</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="011542_0026_0F8726115451CC28">
to their King hath not only been ever untainted, it hath never been as much as &s;u&s;pected. There is a difference between inde|pendency and unea&s;ine&s;s. In the late reign, the people in <HI>England</HI> were unea&s;y at the <HI>Jew</HI> Bill, and it was rapidly repealed; in the pre&s;ent, the Cyder Act was an odious mea&s;ure, and immediately altered, and that without any di&s;grace or diminution of parliamen|tary authority. If there hath been any appearance of riot in <HI>A|merica,</HI> perhaps it may hereafter appear at who&s;e in&s;tigation, the law was ever open, and even overbearing odious Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers might have been redre&s;&s;ed, if they had thought fit to ap|ply for a legal rather than a military remedy. In <HI>England</HI> it is po&s;&s;ible Maje&s;ty it&s;elf hath met with indignities which have not been &s;hewn in <HI>America</HI> even to tho&s;e men to whom the nation in gene|ral is indebted for the pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s, and it is not improbable, that, after all that hath been &s;aid and done, the <HI>Americans</HI> will be found an exception to the general rule, that oppre&s;&s;ion makes even a wi&s;e man mad: An ancient rule, the truth of which hath been experienced in <HI>England</HI> oftener than in <HI>America.</HI> The opinion of the <HI>Americans</HI> is, that to be taxed where they are not repre&s;ented would deprive them of the rights of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> nay, in time, with the lo&s;s of the con&s;titution, might and mu&s;t deprive them of liber|ty and property altogether. The&s;e it mu&s;t be owned are gloomy apprehen&s;ions; two millions of people are &s;o thoroughly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with them, that even their children unborn may feel the parents im|pre&s;&s;ions; &s;hould there be any real ground for them, the <HI>Americans</HI> can hardly be blamed; they &s;it unea&s;y under them; they can no more help their unea&s;ine&s;s, than deny the blood which glows in their veins, or be angry with the milk that was their fir&s;t nouri&s;h|ment. This is not a dark ab&s;tru&s;e point, but &s;eems plain and e&s;&s;en|ttial to the very being of liberty. The &s;ole que&s;tion is, Is it, or is it not, the right of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> not to be taxed where he is not re|pre&s;ented? Can you be tired of being repre&s;ented, O <HI>Britons!</HI> Is it con&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution you &s;o ju&s;tly boa&s;t of to be thus taxed? Then repre&s;entation is not e&s;&s;ential to your con&s;titution, and &s;ooner or later you will either give it up or be deprived of it. A borough that does not exi&s;t &s;hall &s;end two repre&s;entatives, a &s;ingle county, neither the large&s;t nor riche&s;t, &s;hall &s;end forty-four members, and two millions of &s;ouls, and an extent of land of eigh|teen hundred miles in length, &s;hall have taxes laid on them by &s;uch as never were nearer to them than one thou&s;and leagues, and who&s;e intere&s;t it may be to lay heavy burdens on them in order to lighten their own. And are the&s;e, who are thus taxed, unrepre&s;ented, unheard and unknown, <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and taxed by <HI>Engli&s;hmen?</HI> Do the&s;e enjoy what the charters mo&s;t &s;olemnly en&s;ure them, the &s;ame
<PB N="26" REF="011542_0027_0F87261224250188">
and all the privileges of the &s;ubjects born and re&s;ident within the realm? I mu&s;t doubt it.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who make light of <HI>American</HI> grievances give a plain an&s;wer to this plain que&s;tion, Are the colonies to be taxed by Par|liament repre&s;ented in Parliament? if they are, by whom, or &s;ince when? if not, once more, Is it, or is it not, the right of <HI>Britons</HI> not to be taxed where not repre&s;ented? Here the whole matter hinges, and &s;urely the que&s;tion is not &s;o impertinent but a civil an&s;wer might be given before a mother &s;ends fire and &s;word into her own bowels. When con&s;titutional liberty is once lo&s;t, the tran&s;it is very &s;hort to the lo&s;s of property; the &s;ame power that may deprive of the one may al&s;o deprive of the other, and with equal ju&s;tice; tho&s;e that have not liberty enough to keep their property in reality have no property to keep. Some that look no further build right upon power, and in&s;i&s;t the Parliament can do &s;o. If power is all that is meant very like it may, &s;o it may alter the con&s;titution. If a &s;tately tree &s;hould take umbrage at &s;ome diminutive &s;hrubs, it can fall upon and cru&s;h them, but it cannot fall upon them without tearing up its own roots; it can cru&s;h tho&s;e within reach, but its own branches will take off the weight of the impre&s;&s;ion, permit the &s;hrubs to &s;end forth new &s;hoots, while there is no great probability that the envious oak will return to its former &s;tand and vigour. <HI>Ce'&s;t une cho&s;e a bien con&s;iderer,</HI> (this ought to be well con&s;idered fir&s;t) &s;aid <HI>Moliere</HI>'s <HI>Malade imaginaire,</HI> when his quack propo&s;ed to him to have one of his arms cut off, becau&s;e it took &s;ome of the nouri&s;hment which in that ca&s;e would center in the other, and make it &s;o much the &s;tronger. If every A&s;&s;embly in <HI>America</HI> is &s;u&s;|pended, the con&s;equence mu&s;t be, that the people are without their u&s;ual legi&s;lature, and in that ca&s;e nothing &s;hort of a miracle &s;eems capable to prevent an anarchy and general confu&s;ion. No power can alter the nature of things, that which is wrong cannot be right, and oppre&s;&s;ion will never be productive of the love and &s;miles of tho&s;e that feel it.</P>
<P>The Parliament can cru&s;h the <HI>Americans,</HI> but it can al&s;o, and with infinitely greater certainty and ea&s;e, conciliate their affections, have the ultimate gain of all their labours, and by only continuing them the privileges of <HI>Britons,</HI> that is, by only doing as they would be done by, diffu&s;e the ble&s;&s;ings of love and concord throughout the whole empire, and to the late&s;t po&s;terity; and which of the&s;e two is the mo&s;t eligible, it is NOW for you, O <HI>Britons!</HI> to con&s;ider, and in con&s;idering it, <HI>majores ve&s;tros cogitate &amp; po&s;teros,</HI> think on your ance&s;tors and your po&s;terity.</P>
<P><HI>Tho&s;e whom God hath joined together,</HI> (Great-Britain <HI>and</HI> America&punc; <HI>Liberty and Loyalty) let no man put a&s;under: And may peace and pro&s;pe|rity ever attend this happy union.</HI> FEB. 1, 1769.</P>
