<P>WHAT Tidings from the Grave! Why ha&s;t thou left the peaceful Man&s;ions of the Tomb, to vi&s;it again this troubled Earth! Art thou the welcome Me&s;&s;enger of Peace! Art thou ri&s;en again to exhibit thy glorious Wounds, and thro' them proclaim Salvation to thy Country! Or art thou come to demand that la&s;t Debt of Humanity, to which your Rank and Merit have &s;o ju&s;tly entitled you&mdash;but which has been &s;o long ungenerou&s;ly withheld! And art thou angry at the barbarous u&s;age? Be appea&s;ed, &s;weet Gho&s;t! For tho' thy Body has long laid undi&s;tingui&s;hed among the vulgar Dead, &s;carce prive|leged
<PB N="6" REF="014892_0005_0F973FABABEF7F60">
with Earth enough to hide it from the Birds of Prey; tho' not a kindred Tear was dropt, tho' not a friendly Sigh was uttered, o'er thy Grave; and tho' the Execrations of an impious Foe, were all thy Funeral Knells; yet matchle&s;s Patriot! thy Memory has been embalmed in the Affections of thy grateful Countrymen; who in their Brea&s;t have rai&s;ed eternal Monuments to thy Bravery!</P>
<P>BUT let us leave the beloved Remains, and contemplate for a Moment, tho&s;e Virtues of the Man, the Exerci&s;e of which have &s;o de&s;ervedly endeared him to the hone&s;t among the Great, and the Good among the humble.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>private</HI> Walks of Life, he was a Pattern for Man|kind.&mdash;The Tears of her, to whom the World's indebted for &s;o much Virtue, are &s;ilent Heralds of his <HI>filial Piety</HI>: While his tender Offspring, in li&s;ping out their Father's Care, proclaim his <HI>parential Affection:</HI> And an ADAMS can witne&s;s with how much Zeal he loved, where he had formed the &s;acred Connection of a <HI>Friend;</HI>&mdash; their kindred Souls were &s;o clo&s;ely twined, that both felt one Joy, both one Affliction. In Conver&s;ation he had the happy Talent of addre&s;&s;ing his Subject both to the Under&s;tanding and the Pa&s;&s;ions; from the one he forced Conviction, from the other he &s;tole A&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>HE was ble&s;&s;ed with a Complacency of Di&s;po&s;ition, and Equa|nimity of Temper, which peculiarly endeared him to his Friends;
<PB N="7" REF="014892_0006_0F973FAD09294E70">
and which, added to the Deportment of the Gentleman, command|ed Reverence and E&s;teem even from his Enemies.</P>
<P>SUCH was the tender Sen&s;ibility of his Soul, that he need but &s;ee Di&s;tre&s;s to feel it, and contribute to its Relief.&mdash;He was deaf to the Calls of Intere&s;t even in the Cour&s;e of his Profe&s;&s;ion; and wherever he beheld an indigent Object, which claimed his healing Skill, he admini&s;tred it, without even the Hope of any other Re|ward, than that which re&s;ulted from the Reflection of having &s;o far promoted the Happine&s;s of his Fellow Men.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> Departments of Life, practi&s;ing upon the Strength of that Doctrine, he u&s;ed &s;o earne&s;tly to inculcate him&s;elf, that no|thing &s;o much conduced to enlighten Mankind, and advance the great End of Society at large, as the frequent Interchange of Sen|timents, in friendly Meetings; we find him con&s;tantly engaged in this eligible Labour; but on none did he place &s;o high a Value, as on that <HI>mo&s;t honorable</HI> of all detached Societies, THE FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS: Into this Fraternity he was early initiated; and after having given repeated Proofs of a rapid Proficiency in the Arts, and after evidencing by his Life, the Profe&s;&s;ions of his Lips&mdash; finally, as the Reward of his Merit, he was commi&s;&s;ioned <HI>the mo&s;t wor&s;hipful</HI> GRAND MASTER of all the ancient Ma&s;ons, thro' <HI>North-America.</HI>&mdash;And you, Brethren, are living Te&s;timonies, with how much Honor to him&s;elf, and Benefit to the Craft univer&s;al, he di&s;charged the Duties of his elevated Tru&s;t; with what &s;weetned
<PB N="8" REF="014892_0007_0F973FAD4CC9E148">
Accents he courted your Attention, while with <HI>Wi&s;dom, Strength and Beauty,</HI> he in&s;tructed his Lodges in the &s;ecret Arts of <HI>Free-ma&s;onry;</HI> what perfect Order and Decorum he pre&s;erved in the Go|vernment of them; and in all his Conduct, what a bright Example he &s;et us, <HI>to live within Compa&s;s, and act upon the Square.</HI></P>
<P>WITH what Plea&s;ure did he &s;ilence the Wants of poor and pen|nyle&s;s Brethren; yea the Nece&s;&s;itous every where, tho' ignorant of the My&s;teries of the Craft, from his Benefactions, felt the happy Effects of that In&s;titution which is founded on <HI>Faith, Hope and Charity.</HI> And the World may cea&s;e to wonder, that he &s;o readily offered up his Life, on the Altar of his Country, when they are told, that the main Pillar of <HI>Ma&s;onry,</HI> is the LOVE OF MANKIND.</P>
<P>THE Fates, as tho' they would reveal, in the Per&s;on of our GRAND MASTER, tho&s;e My&s;teries, which have &s;o long lain hid from the World, have &s;uffered him, like the great Ma&s;ter-builder in the Temple of old, to fall by the Hands of Ruffians, and be again rai&s;ed in Honor and Authority: We &s;earched in the Field for the murdered Son of a Widow, and we found him, <HI>by the Turf and the Twig,</HI> buried on the Brow of a Hill, tho' not in a decent Grave.&mdash;And tho' we mu&s;t again commit his Body to the Tomb, yet our Brea&s;ts &s;hall be the Burying Spot of his <HI>Ma&s;onic Virtues,</HI> and there&mdash;</P>
<L>"An adamantine Monument we'll rear,"</L>
<L>"With this In&s;cription," <HI>Ma&s;onry</HI> "lies here."&mdash;</L>
<P><PB N="9" REF="014892_0008_0F973FAE0707A308">IN <HI>public</HI> Life, the &s;ole Object of his Ambition was to acquire the Con&s;cience of virtuous Enterprizes; <HI>Amor Patriae</HI> was the Spring of his Actions, and <HI>Mens Con&s;cia Recti</HI> was his Guide.&mdash; And on this Security he was, on every Occa&s;ion, ready to &s;acrifice his Health, his Intere&s;t and his Ea&s;e, to the &s;acred Calls of his Country. When the Liberties of America were attacked, he ap|peared an early Champion in the Conte&s;t; and tho' his Knowledge and Abilities would have in&s;ured Riches and Preferment (could he have &s;toop'd to Pro&s;titution) yet he nobly with&s;tood the fa&s;cinating Charm, to&s;&s;ed Fortune back her Plume, and per&s;ued the inflexible Purpo&s;e of his Soul, in guiltle&s;s Competence.</P>
<P>HE &s;ought not the airy Honors of a Name, el&s;e, many of tho&s;e Publications, which in the early Period of our Controver&s;y &s;erved to open the Minds of the People, had not appeared anonymous. In every time of eminent Danger, his Fellow-Citizens flew to him for Advice; like the Orator of Athens, he gave it, and di&s;pell'd their Fears:&mdash;Twice did they call him to the Ro&s;trum, to comme|morate the Ma&s;&s;acre of their Brethren; and from that In&s;tance, in per&s;ua&s;ive Language he taught them, not only the dangerous Ten|dency, but the actual Mi&s;chief, of &s;tationing a Military Force, in a free City, in a Time of Peace.&mdash;They learnt the profitable Le&s;&s;on, and pen'd it among their Grievances.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014892_0009_0F973FAEA59F64B8">BUT his Abilities were too great, his Deliberations too much wanted, to be confined to the Limits of a &s;ingle City, and at a Time when our Liberties were mo&s;t critically in Danger from the &s;e|cret Machinations and open A&s;&s;aults of our Enemies, this Town, to their la&s;ting Honor, elected him to take a Part in the Councils of the State.&mdash;And with what Faithfulne&s;s he di&s;charged the impor|tant Delegation, the Neglect of his private Concerns, and his un|wearied Attendance on that Betru&s;tment, will &s;ufficiently te&s;tify: and the Records of that virtuous A&s;&s;embly will remain the Te&s;ti|monials of his Accompli&s;hments as a State&s;man, and his Integrity and Services as a Patriot, thro' all Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s of our Colony could not ob&s;erve &s;o much Virtue and Greatne&s;s without honoring it with the highe&s;t Mark of their Favour; and by the free Suffrages of that uncorrupted Body of Freemen, he was &s;oon called to pre&s;ide in the Senate.&mdash;Where by his daily Councils and Exertions, he was con&s;tantly promoting the great Cau&s;e of <HI>General Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when he found the Tools of Oppre&s;&s;ion were ob&s;tinately bent on Violence; when he found the Vengeance of the Briti&s;h Court mu&s;t he glutted with Blood; he determined, that what he could not effect by his Eloquence or his Pen, he would bring to Purpo&s;e by his Sword. And on the memorable 19th of April, he appeared in the Field, under the united Characters of the General, the Soldier and the Phy&s;ician.&mdash;Here he was &s;een animating his
<PB N="11" REF="014892_0010_0F973FAF6F3651A8">
Countrymen to Battle, and fighting by their Side, and there he was found admini&s;tering healing Comforts to the wounded. And when he had repelled the unprovoked A&s;&s;aults of the Enemy, and had driven them back into their Strong-holds, like the virtuous Chief of Rome, he returned to the Senate, and pre&s;ided again at the Councils of the Fathers.</P>
<P>WHEN the vanqui&s;hed Foe had rallied their di&s;ordered Army, and by the Acqui&s;ition of fre&s;h Strength, again pre&s;umed to fight again&s;t Freemen; our Patriot, ever anxious to be, where he could do the mo&s;t good, again put off the Senator, and in Contempt of Danger flew to the Field of Battle, where, after a &s;tern, and <HI>almo&s;t</HI> victorious Re&s;i&s;tance, ah! too &s;oon for his Country! he &s;ealed his Principles with his Blood&mdash;then&mdash;</P>
<L>"Freedom wept, that <HI>MERIT</HI> could not &s;ave,"</L>
<L>But <HI>WARREN's</HI> Manes "mu&s;t enrich the Grave."</L>
<P>Enriched indeed! And the Heights of <HI>Charle&s;town</HI> &s;hall be more memorable for thy Fall, than the <HI>Plains of Abraham</HI> are for that of the Hero of <HI>Britain.</HI> For while <HI>he</HI> died contending for a &s;ingle Country, <HI>You</HI> fell in the Cau&s;e of Virtue and Mankind.</P>
<P>THE Greatne&s;s of his Soul &s;hone even in the Moment of Death; for if Fame &s;peaks true, in his la&s;t Agonies he met the In&s;ults of his barbarous Foe, with his wonted Magnanimity, and with the true Spirit of a Soldier, frowned at their Impotence.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="014892_0011_0F973FB025F32620">IN Fine, to compleat the great Character&mdash;like HARRING|TON he wrote, like CICERO he &s;poke, like HAMPDEN he lived, and like WOLFE he died.</P>
<P>AND can we, my Countrymen, with Indifference behold &s;o much Worth and Valour laid pro&s;trate by the Hand of <HI>Briti&s;h Tyranny!</HI> And can we ever gra&s;p that Hand in Affection again? &mdash;Are we not yet convinced "that he who hunts the Woods for Prey, the naked and untutored Indian, is le&s;s a Savage than the <HI>King of Britain"!</HI> Have we not Proofs, wrote in Blood, that the corrupted Nation, from whence we &s;prang (tho' there may be &s;ome Traces of their ancient Virtue left) are &s;tubbornly fixed on our De&s;truction! And &s;hall we &s;till court a <HI>Dependance</HI> on &s;uch a State? Still contend for a Connection with tho&s;e, who have forfeited not only every kindred Claim, but even their Title to Humanity! Forbid it the Spirit of the brave MONTGOMORY! Forbid it the Spirit of immortal WARREN! Forbid it the Spirits of all our valiant Coun|trymen! Who fought, bled and died for far different Purpo&s;es; and who would have thought the Purcha&s;e <HI>dear indeed!</HI> to have paid their Lives for the paltry Boon, of di&s;placing one Set of Vil|lains in Power, to make Way for another. No. They contend|ed for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Peace, Liberty and Safety to their Coun|try, and we are unworthy to be called their Countrymen, if we &s;top at any Acpui&s;ition &s;hort of this.</P>
