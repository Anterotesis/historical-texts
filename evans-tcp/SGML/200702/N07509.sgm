<P>O GOD, the father of lights, author of truth and virtue, from whom de&s;cendeth every good and perfect gift; we mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech thee, through the mediation of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, favourably with thy mercy to hear our prayers, and grant all our petitions agreable to thy will.

<P>EPHESUS, a maritime city of I&ouml;nia, renowned for its opulence, commerce, and &s;uper&s;titions, was a place of the greate&s;t re&s;ort of any in the <HI>province of A&s;ia:</HI> and bu&s;ine&s;s, curio&s;ity, or religion drew thither men of all cha|racters and conditions.

There being &s;o

great a diver&s;ity in the former &s;tate and opinions of tho&s;e, who had become his converts; &s;ome from Judai&s;m, others from Idolatry; &s;ome from the &s;chools of &s;cience and philo&s;o|phy; others, who had been addicted to magic and the <HI>curious arts</HI> of Super&s;tition: the learned and judicious Apo&s;tle every where adapts his addre&s;s to their &s;everal manners and preju|dices; and labours e&s;pecially, to combine in one body and in one communion, in <HI>the unity of the &s;pirit</HI> and <HI>in the bond of Peace,</HI> men who had no common principle of union or cha|rity, but what they derived from their Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion.

In pur&s;uing this topic of Unity, which is principally kept in &s;ight through the whole Epi&s;tle; he inlar|ges, in the III fir&s;t Chapters, on the tran&s;cendent privileges of the Chri&s;tian Church, into which men of all nations and cha|racters were freely admitted, as into a &s;chool of virtue, and<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">CH. 1. 3, 5, 10.</NOTE> 'ble&s;&s;ed with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings,' that in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times (a well known periphra&s;is for the re|velation of the Go&s;pel) GOD might gather together in One all things in CHRIST: being <HI>cho&s;en in him, before the foundation of the world, that they &s;hould be</HI> henceforth <HI>holy and without blame before him in love; prede&s;tinated unto the adoption of children by</HI>

JESUS CHRIST. In con&s;equence of the&s;e general privileges of Redemption, in the latter part of the Epi&s;tle he exhorts them to <HI>walk worthy of the vocation, wherewith</HI> they were <HI>cal|led;</HI> and de&s;cends to many admirable <HI>precepts</HI> for the conduct of the Chri&s;tian life in all its relations. That of the text, as applicable to the &s;olemnity of this place and time, &s;hall be particularly opened and enlarged upon. It is only &s;o far con|nected with the context, as it is part of an addre&s;s to the E|phe&s;ian converts, in&s;tead of their <HI>former</HI> vain <HI>conver&s;ation,</HI> to &s;ub&s;titute manners becoming their new and holy profe&s;&s;ion. <Q>Ye WERE &s;ometimes darkne&s;s; but NOW are ye light in the LORD: WALK as children of light&mdash;See then that ye walk circum&s;pectly, not as fools but as wi&s;e, redeeming the time:</Q> that is, making up by an extraordinary diligence in Chri&s;tian &s;anctification, for the time lo&s;t in a &s;tate of gentili&s;m. He then exhorts them to temperance and &s;obriety, in oppo|&s;ition to their heathen revellings; <HI>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is exce&s;s,</HI> or luxury and riot: and teaches them to regulate their mirth by the Chri&s;tian &s;tandard. <Q><HI>But be filled with the</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>&s;peaking to your&s;elves in p&s;alms and hymns and &s;piritual &s;ongs,</HI> SINGING and MAKING MELODY <HI>in your heart to the</HI> LORD.</Q></P>
<P>BY being <HI>filled with the &s;pirit,</HI> the Apo&s;tle intimates, what he explains more at large in his Epi&s;tles to the Corinthians, that the P&s;almody or &s;acred Poetry of the Chri&s;tian Church was

<P>THE Engli&s;h Expre&s;&s;ion in the text, <HI>&s;peaking to your&s;elves,</HI> does not, I think, convey the &s;en&s;e of the Apo&s;tle, or indeed any other good &s;en&s;e. <HI>Lalountes eautois</HI> or <HI>en eautois,</HI> is liter|ally, <HI>&s;peaking between your&s;elves,</HI> that is, <HI>alternately,</HI> in the manner in which we recite our P&s;alms. This &s;en&s;e is well expre&s;&s;ed in an invaluable Epi&s;tle of PLINY the con&s;ul<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Lib. x. epi&s;t. 97, de Chri&s;tianis.</NOTE>; who gives this noble te&s;timony of the Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip. <Q>Soliti &s;tato die ante lucem convenire, carmenque CHRISTO qua&s;i DEO dicere &s;ecum invicem.

GOD, alternately.</Q> The <HI>&s;ecum invicem</HI> of PLINY is the <HI>en eautois</HI> of the Apo&s;tle. This interpretation is confirmed by a parallel pa&s;&s;age to the Colo&s;&s;ians:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">COLOSS. III. 16, where <HI>eautois</HI> is u&s;ed for <HI>all&ecirc;lois,</HI> as in Ephe&s;.

<P>IN both places, this di&s;tinction of the &s;acred poetry into <HI>p&s;alms, hymns,</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual &s;ongs,</HI> &s;eems to be taken from the different kinds of poetic compo&s;ition in the old te&s;tament, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the&s;e &s;everal titles. The <HI>p&s;alm</HI> an&s;wers to the <HI>mizmor</HI> of the Hebrews; <HI>hymns,</HI> to their <HI>Te|hillim,</HI> or prai&s;es; and <HI>&s;ongs,</HI> to their <HI>Shirim</HI> or Odes. The epithet of <HI>&s;piritual</HI> either implies their being dictated by the HOLY SPIRIT; or their di&s;tinction from the profane and li|bertine &s;ongs, u&s;ed in the heathen rites and fe&s;tivities.</P>

Of the fir&s;t, there is no doubt of its having always obtained in the wor&s;hip of Chri&s;tians; the latter, as a matter of <HI>Fact,</HI> is not &s;o certain, though, as a matter of <HI>right</HI> and lawfulne&s;s, it is clear enough from this and other texts, and from &s;everal ar|guments
<PB N="6" REF="009584_0011_0F76DE9605D74CE0">
which confirm this po&s;ition. The words <HI>p&s;all&ocirc;</HI> u&s;ed in this text, properly &s;ignifies <HI>to &s;ing to an in&s;trument;</HI> and is appropriated rather to the &s;triking of chords, as in the lute or harp, than to the accompaniment of the voice. But the lawful u&s;e of in&s;trumental mu&s;ic in our Churches, does not depend meerly on the argument drawn from this etymology: though without this appropriation of the words, <HI>&s;inging</HI> to the <HI>voice,</HI> and <HI>making melody,</HI> to the <HI>in&s;truments,</HI> the text will una|voidably labour with a di&s;tinction without a difference: an in|accuracy &s;eldom to be found in the holy writings, wherein a more exact propriety of words, is, I think, ob&s;ervable, than in any other ancient books.</P>
<P>IT is well known that in the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>I&ouml;nian</HI> cities, Mu&s;ic was &s;o much in vogue, that a man was reckoned ill-bred, who could not touch an in&s;trument. All their poetry, e&s;pecially of the lyric kind, and in the rites of Religion, was accompanied with mu&s;ic: And univer&s;ally among the anci|ents, poetry and mu&s;ic were in&s;eparable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hendeca&s;yllaborum volumen&mdash;legitur, de&s;cribitur, <HI>cantatur</HI> etiam, et a Graecis quoque,&mdash;nunc <HI>cithar&acirc;</HI> nunc <HI>lyr&acirc;</HI> per&s;onatur.'

From which we may draw a very probable conclu&s;ion, that the Ephe&s;ian con|verts were permitted by the Apo&s;tle to accompany their p&s;alms and hymns, with &s;uch kinds of in&s;truments, as were then in u&s;e: mere &s;inging, without the grace of harmony and modu|lation by the lute or other in&s;truments, being almo&s;t entirely unknown to antiquity.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009584_0012_0F76DE9673178378">
HAVING thus commented on the text, I proceed to confirm this interpretation, by enquiring into the origin of Poetry and Mu&s;ic, and their application to Religion.</P>
<P>POETRY is the child of Admiration. Our nobler pa&s;&s;ions, when &s;trongly excited by wonder and &s;urprize, vent them&s;elves in elevated &s;entiments and figurative language. Invention, Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and Sublimity of &s;tile form the e&s;&s;ence of Poetry<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><LG>

<L><HI>Magna &s;onaturum</HI>&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<BIBL>HORAT. lib. 1. &s;at. IV. 43.</BIBL></NOTE>; and as the&s;e are connected mo&s;t intimately with our ideas of the Divinity, Religion is the natural &s;ource of Poetry. Among the Greeks, (the mo&s;t poetical nation in the world, except the Hebrews) the fir&s;t efforts of poetry, were the prai&s;es of the gods, in hymns of thankfulne&s;s for fruitful &s;ea&s;ons and the harve&s;t or vintage. Among the Hebrews, the inventors of poetry, it had a &s;till nobler origin, and a truer application: being always con&s;ecrated to Religion, and having never dege|nerated like that of other nations, to inferior purpo&s;es. The poetry of the Hebrews, being dictated by a real In&s;piration, came to its perfection at once; and with the noble&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m and &s;ublimity of &s;tile and &s;entiment, has all the artifice of an exact though &s;imple ver&s;ification. The mo&s;t ancient regular poems that are pre&s;erved entire in the &s;criptures, are tho&s;e of Mo&s;es at the pa&s;&s;age of the Red Sea, Exod. XV. and near the end of his life, Deut. XXXII. and perhaps the XCth P&s;alm.
<PB N="8" REF="009584_0013_0F76DE9771B25DC8">
But fragments of much greater antiquity are inter&s;per&s;ed in the Pentateuch. It is particularly noted, that the &s;ong at the pa&s;&s;age of the Red Sea was performed by choru&s;&s;es of men and women; and accompanied with dancing and in&s;truments.</P>
<P>AS the Poetry of Scripture makes &s;o large a part of the Old Te&s;tament; I will offer a few ob&s;ervations on &s;uch books and pieces, as are &s;trictly poetical, not only in the elevation of &s;tile and &s;entiment, but in the cadence and ver&s;ification. This every where con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>i&auml;mbic</HI> or <HI>troch&auml;ic</HI> mea&s;ures, corre&s;ponding to the numbers and accent of our Engli&s;h poe|try: being not di&s;tingui&s;hed from pro&s;e, by the length or &s;hortne&s;s of feet and &s;yllables, but &s;olely by the regular ac|cent, and harmonious cadence. The figures that mo&s;t a|bound in the Hebrew poetry are the antithe&s;is and the ple|ona&s;m or climax. Mo&s;t of the ver&s;es con&s;i&s;t of two mem|bers, the latter of which is often an amplification or oppo|&s;ition to the former; and is u&s;ually a key to the true inter|pretation of ob&s;curer pa&s;&s;ages. This artifice in the compo|&s;ition is one rea&s;on, that the fire and &s;pirit of the Hebrew poetry cannot be extingui&s;hed in the mo&s;t literal and pro&s;aic ver&s;ion. Our own language &s;eems very happily adapted to expre&s;s, in a kind of mea&s;ured pro&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Should the Church be ble&s;&s;ed with a new Engli&s;h ver&s;ion of the Scriptures, or with an exact and critical correction of the pre&s;ent Tran&s;lation: together with a more ju&s;t divi&s;ion of the Chapters and Paragraphs; might it not add to the per&s;picuity and elegance of the poetical books, to di&s;po&s;e them accord|ing to the Hebrew metre, &s;tiche-wi&s;e or in ver&s;icles; as in Dr. <HI>Grabe'</HI>s edition of the Septuagint, and as in Bi&s;hop <HI>Hare'</HI>s hebrew edition of the P&s;alms, and Dr. <HI>Grey'</HI>s, of Job, Proverbs, &amp;c?</NOTE>, the peculiar genius of Ea&s;tern poetry.</P>

BESIDES the lyric poems of Mo&s;es, which were wrote 1500 years before Homer, we have in the Book of Judges. Ch. V. the triumphant &s;ong of Deborah and Barak, on the defeat of the Midianites.

HIS Proverbs are a didactic poem, of very different charac|ters: the fir&s;t part (ch.

It appears from the CXXXVIIth p&s;alm, that the Jews in their captivity were highly e&s;teemed for their mu&s;ic by their Conquerors; and we read that 200 mu&s;icians of both &s;exes returned with Ezra from Babylon<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">EZRA II. 65.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO nation &s;eems more to have cultivated this art, than the Jews: though wonders are told us of the Grecian mu&s;ic, which was under the regulation of their Legi&s;lators, and of great influence on the public manners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">POLYBIUS, a&s;cribes the ferocity of the <HI>Cynaethians,</HI> and the humane and ho&s;pitable di&s;po&s;ition of the other <HI>Arcadians,</HI> chiefly to the neglect of mu&s;ic among the former, and the e&s;teem and practice of it among the re&s;t.

We find the P&s;almi&s;ts, e&s;pecially David, on all occa|&s;ions exerting, in the prai&s;es of GOD, the combined powers of Mu&s;ic and Poetry; whatever in harmony or &s;ong could &s;ooth the ear, and kindle the heart to holie&s;t raptures:

IN the CLth p&s;alm he calls upon all nature, animate and in|animate, to prai&s;e the LORD; and on man, to prai&s;e him with the &s;ound of the trumpet, with the p&s;altery and harp, with the timbrel and dance, with &s;tringed in&s;truments and organs, with loud and high-&s;ounding cymbals. <HI>Let every thing that hath breath prai&s;e the</HI> LORD.

<P>THE fine arts, not only of Mu&s;ic and Poetry, but tho&s;e of Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting, the powers of Elo|quence, and every true expre&s;&s;ion of ta&s;te and genius, are all undoubtedly derived from GOD. This is as evident from Rea&s;on as from Revelation. There can be no in&s;tance of intelligence in man, but what is derived from an intelligent cau&s;e. In the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hip, the Tabernacle and Temple, with all their rich ornaments; becoming tho&s;e palaces of the KING of Kings, and the maje&s;ty of the Theocracy; were fi|ni&s;hed on the models given by GOD him&s;elf. Yet an opinion &s;eems to have taken deep root in the minds of &s;erious per&s;ons, that what are properly called the fine arts, are almo&s;t incom|patible with the Chri&s;tian life, and a heavenly temper. The rea&s;on of which hard cen&s;ure is, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e arts
<PB N="16" REF="009584_0021_0F76DE9EC3909CE8">
have generally been &s;o gro&s;ly perverted to the gratification of pride and luxury, and a profane voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. Thus, the noble powers of Poetry have been in many in&s;tances deba&s;ed to the vile&s;t purpo&s;es: Mu&s;ic hath been the attendant of re|velling and licentious exce&s;&s;es: Sculpture and Painting, in pagan and papal countries, have lent their aid to &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry: Eloquence, Ta&s;te, and Genius have been pro|faned, to flatter the pomp, or varni&s;h the deformity of vice. The abu&s;e has in a manner de&s;ecrated all the arts of Ele|gance, and made good men piou&s;ly aver&s;e to them. Yet in them&s;elves, and under ju&s;t regulations, they are friendly to <HI>virtue,</HI> and a &s;ource of <HI>happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>To retrieve the ju&s;t e&s;teem of the fine arts, by making them &s;ub&s;ervient to Religion and Virtue, is the true&s;t appli|cation of ta&s;te and genius. Wealth, when it increa&s;es be|yond the wants and conveniencies of Society, if it is not vent|ed on the Elegant arts, will be perverted to the gro&s;&s;er plea|&s;ures of vice and luxury. This &s;eems to be the pre&s;ent ca&s;e of England, where the&s;e arts are even nece&s;&s;ary, to check or di|vert every &s;pecies of corruption. But in our own Country, it mu&s;t be di&s;cerned, that we are &s;o far from that opulence, which demands the cultivation of the finer arts, that the more &s;paringly they are introduced among us, the longer &s;hall we &s;ecure the &s;implicity and frugality of our manners. What we do attempt of this kind, cannot better be applied, than to the &s;ervice and ornament of Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009584_0022_0F76DE9F6E961A08">
IT is natural to object, that the arguments for &s;plendour and elegance, in the buildings, mu&s;ic, and other decorations relating to Religion, being derived from Jewi&s;h in&s;titutions, are of no force when applied to the Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip. Yet there &s;eems to be &s;omething not &s;o ea&s;ily abrogated in the immediate appointments of GOD him&s;elf: and tho&s;e, not (like many of the Jewi&s;h rites) of temporary u&s;e and application, but &s;uitable to the general frame of human nature; and no le&s;s apt at pre&s;ent, than in Solomon's temple, to rai&s;e in our hearts religious affections, and elevate the Soul to GOD.</P>
<P>WE find the prophet Eli&s;ha, when ruffled by his interview with the King of I&s;rael, calming his troubled &s;pirits with mu&s;ic: <HI>and when the min&s;trel played, the hand of the</HI> LORD <HI>came upon him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">KINGS b. II. ch. III. 15.</NOTE>. Such &s;hould be the effect of &s;acred mu&s;ic in our churches; it &s;hould calm the agitations of our minds, it &s;hould compo&s;e our &s;pirits, and lift up our hearts to GOD, in an holy chearfulne&s;s and &s;erenity. GOD loves not a dull and melancholy &s;pirit. Much of that dejection, we &s;ee in &s;ome religious people, is <HI>the &s;orrow of the world</HI> that <HI>worketh death;</HI> or is the effect of wrong apprehen&s;ions. We are commanded to <HI>'Rejoice evermore.' Rejoice in the</HI> LORD <HI>always, and again I &s;ay, Rejoice.</HI> Phil. IV. 4. Much more might be alledged, to prove that the true Chri&s;tian &s;pirit, is a &s;pirit of alacrity and chearfulne&s;s, of &s;erenity and joy: a &s;pirit, as dif|ferent from that dejection and &s;tupid &s;adne&s;s, which good
<PB N="18" REF="009584_0023_0F76DE9FD52131E8">
men &s;ometimes mi&s;take for the temper of the go&s;pel; as it is from the <HI>laughter of fools,</HI> which, like <HI>the crackling of thorns,</HI> is but a &s;hort-lived momentary blaze, that expires in a fla&s;h of mirth. The Chri&s;tian temper is a perfect acquie&s;cence and reliance on GOD, through CHRIST. To the faithful and vir|tuous this opens the happie&s;t pro&s;pects; which, though &s;ome|times thrown into &s;hades, every where brighten on the di&s;|tant view. The Faith, the Hopes, the Duties of a Chri&s;tian &s;upport him in that calm, that peaceful, that delightful ele|vation of Soul, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, is the immediate effect of re|ligious mu&s;ic, on tho&s;e who attend to it with right affections.</P>
<P>MUSIC, when rightly applied, is a powerful aid to a devout and holy temper: it is as powerful, when mi&s;applied, to ef|face every &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion. How much then is it the duty of tho&s;e, who practice this divine art in our churches, to re|gulate their performance by the purpo&s;e of it? and, in&s;tead of indulging them&s;elves in any unbecoming levities of compo&s;i|tion or execution, to practice that grave and &s;ober melody, which may compo&s;e and fix the mind in a &s;erene and holy chearfulne&s;s; tho&s;e &s;oft and pathetic airs, which melt the heart to penitence; or tho&s;e high and &s;olemn &s;trains, which rai&s;e the &s;oul in adoration to GOD?</P>

For which cau&s;e, there is nothing more contagious and pe&s;tilent, than &s;ome kinds of harmony; than &s;ome, nothing more &s;trong and potent unto good.&mdash;At the hearing of &s;ome, we are more inclined unto &s;orrow and heavine&s;s; of &s;ome, more mollified and &s;oftened in mind; one kind, apter to &s;tay and &s;ettle us; another, to move and &s;tir our affections. There is, that

draweth to a marvellous grave and &s;ober mediocrity; there is al&s;o, that carrieth, as it were, into extacies, filling the mind with an heavenly joy, and, for the time, in a manner &s;evering it from the body. So that&mdash;the very harmony of &s;ounds, carried from the ear to the &s;piritual faculties of our &s;ouls, is by a native pui&s;&s;ance and efficacy, greatly available, to bring to a perfect temper what&s;oever is there troubled; apt, as well to quicken the &s;pirits, as to allay that which is too eager; &s;overaign again&s;t melancholy and de&s;pair: forceable to draw forth tears of devotion, if the mind be &s;uch as can yield them; able both to move and to mo|derate all affections.&mdash;In which con&s;iderations, the Church of CHRIST doth likewi&s;e at this pre&s;ent day retain it; as an ornament to GOD's &s;ervice, and an help to our own de|votion.</Q></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t however be ob&s;erved, that, in early times, the Chri&s;|tian p&s;almody, agreable to the depre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted &s;tate of the church, mu&s;t have been very plain and &s;imple: and per|haps for &s;everal ages, e&s;pecially in the we&s;tern parts, without in&s;trumental accompaniments; the Organ in particular hav|ing not been introduced into churches, 'till the XIIth Cen|tury.
