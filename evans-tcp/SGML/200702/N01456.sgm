<P>MAY the GOD of all Grace in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by His holy Spi|rit, &s;o influence our Souls, that by Minding the di&s;pen&s;ations of His holy <HI>Ordinances,</HI> we may come to under|&s;tand &s;omething of the meaning of the di&s;|pen&s;ations of His awful <HI>Providences</HI> among us.

<P>It would be inexcu&s;able inadvertency in us, and a dreadful token of lamentable Stupidity in our Souls, if we &s;hould take no Notice of the late Stupendous, Tre|mendous dealings of the glorious Lord a|mong us, while the very bars of the Infer|nal Pit have &s;eemed, as it were, to &s;hiver and the dreadful Smoke of the bottomle&s;s Lake hath begun to break out and a&s;cend before our Eyes: And the venemous Vi|pers of Hell have had a Permi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e up their heads and after a very uncommon manner, to &s;pit about their Venom upon us, and to &s;hew us a little of their cur&s;ed and cruel di&s;po&s;ition, by the blood that hath been &s;hed, and the fire that hath been kindled in our Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>What means the heat of this anger of the Lord our God! The <HI>Words</HI> of God mu&s;t be attended that we may under&s;tand the <HI>Works</HI> of God.

<P><HI>The Lords voice cryeth unto the City.</HI> The Word of God proclaimes Wrath, Anger, Indignation again&s;t all Impenitent Sinners.

<HEAD>DOCTRINE. It would be the Prudence of all People, and will be the Practice of wi&s;e People to take &s;uch notice of the Extraordinary di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD as to learn the de&s;ign of GOD in managing of His Controver&s;y with Sinners, by tho&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ations.</HEAD>
<P>We have &s;everal Propo&s;itions to be con|&s;idered under this Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">I. PROP. <HI>The GOD of Heaven does frequently manage a controver&s;y with Sinners upon Earth for their Mi&s;demeanours before Him.</HI> He &s;hews that he is di&s;plea&s;ed at them. And he &s;hews them that he hath ju&s;t cau&s;e to be &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed. Their wayes are not plea&s;ing in his &s;ight, and &s;o he walks in wayes toward them, that are not plea&s;ing nor ea&s;y to them. So in the Second Ver&s;e of this Chapter, it is &s;aid,
<PB N="8" REF="001729_0005_0FB77B59944623C8">
<HI>The Lord hath a Controver&s;y with his People and he will plead with I&s;rael.</HI> Then he tells them what he had done for them. And they had not done before him, as he might ju&s;tly have expected, and therefore he was offended, and they &s;hould be made &s;en&s;i|ble of his di&s;plea&s;ure. And &s;o it was fore|told unto the People of God, in Levit 26, 27 <HI>If you will walk contrary unto me, then I will walk contrary unto you.</HI> The Lord having told them that if they were willing to obey him, then they &s;hould enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of his Covenant. But if they would not hearken to his voice and obey his Commandments and walk in his Sta|tutes, then he would be angry again&s;t them, and they might expect the tokens of his anger: Then he &s;hews them that if they would not repent and be reformed by le&s;&s;er Judgments, then he would bring up on them greater Judgments and puni&s;h them yet Seven times for their iniquities and yet Seven times more, and Seven times more, until their Uncircumci&s;ed hearts be humbled When he hath begun a contro|ver&s;y with Sinners, he will go on with it until they be reformed or de&s;troyed.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="001729_0005_0FB77B59944623C8">
II. PROP. <HI>The Lord is often plea&s;ed to bring Judgments upon Sinners for their Sins, while He is managing his Controver&s;y with then.</HI> He hath threatned them with Judg|ments for their Sins, if they don't turn from their Sins He mu&s;t bring the Judg|ments threatned, that he may appear to be the God of Truth. And he hath done from time to time according to his threat|nings, thus in the Thirteenth ver&s;e of this Chapter, He declares, <HI>I will make thee &s;ick in &s;miling thee, in making thee de&s;olate be|cau&s;e of thy Sins.</HI> Thus al&s;o in Deut 28 58. Sayes the Lord, <HI>If thou wilt not ob&s;erve to do all the Words of this Law, that thou maye&s;t year the glorious and fearful Name,</HI> THE LORD THY GOD. <HI>The Lord &s;hall make thy Plagues wonderful.</HI> He told them that if they would be obedient, they &s;hould en|joy abundance of ble&s;&s;ings, but if they would be rebellious, then there &s;hould be cur&s;es multiplyed upon them. According|ly it came to pa&s;s. The Promi&s;es of ble&s;|&s;ing having been fulfilled, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>So|lom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> could bring in their te&s;timony for that, &s;o far as to their dayes, [in Jo&s;h. 23. 14 1 King. 8 56] The threatnings of cur&s;es were al&s;o wonderfully accompli&s;hed, as both <HI>Jeremiah</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> ob&s;erved,
<PB N="10" REF="001729_0006_0FB77B5B8597A400">
[in Lam. 2. 17. Dan. 9 11.] So the Lord often brings various Judgments upon Sin|ners, while he manageth his controver&s;y with them. They find it a perillous thing to continue in wayes of Sin again&s;t the Holy God. But,</P>
<P N="3">III. PROP. <HI>GOD in plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to Warn Sinners, before He brings Judgments upon them in His managing to His controver&s;y with them.</HI> And the&s;e warnings of God are in various wayes delivered.</P>
<P>For &s;ometimes the Lord warns by his Word. So <HI>the Lords voice Cryes unto the City.</HI> People that read the Word of God, may di&s;cern a cry in the Word which they read, like that in I&s;aiah 3. 10. <HI>We to the Wicked, it &s;hall be ill with him.</HI> The Writ|ten Word of God plainly cryes, <HI>Evil pur|&s;ueth Sinners,</HI> it cryes, <HI>The Soul, that Sinneth, &s;hall dye,</HI> it cryes, <HI>The wages of Sin is Death,</HI> The cry of the Word is, <HI>God will render to every one according to their Works: To them that are contentious and will not obey the truth, he will render indignation and wrath, tribula|tion and angui&s;h, upon every Soul of them.</HI> The plain cry of the Word is, The Wicked &s;hall be turned into Hell &amp; all the Nations that forget God. God will rain upon Im|penitent Sinners, fire and brim&s;tone, a
<PB N="11" REF="001729_0006_0FB77B5B8597A400">
burning Tempe&s;t mu&s;t be the Portion of their cup. God will find a time to call to remembrance the Sins of Sinners, and will &s;et their Sins in order before them for their Eternal confu&s;ion. The plain Cry of the word is that in the a The&s;. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;<HI>The Lord Je&s;us will be revealed from Heaven, with his Mighty Angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; They &s;hall be puni&s;hed with ever|la&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</HI> And be|&s;ides and before the terrible things, that will come at la&s;t upon all finally Impeni|tent Sinners, there are awful cryes in the Word of God again&s;t them, denouncing terrible things in this Life and World. Would People Read the Word of God, as they &s;hould, they might find the Written Word crying again&s;t them for their multi|plyed Impieties again&s;t and before God.</P>
<P>So People that hear the Word of God, may often perceive a cry, like that in Ezek. 18 30. <HI>Repent and turn from all your tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, that iniquity may not be your ruine.</HI> A cry, like that in John 3 36. <HI>He that be|lieveth not the Son of God, the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> A cry, like that in Zeph: 2. 3. <HI>Seek ye the Lord, Seek Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Meekne&s;s, that ye may be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="001729_0007_0FB77B5F835A0458">
The Amba&s;&s;adours of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who are to Preach the Word of God, are commanded, as in I&s;aiah 58 1. <HI>Cry aloud, &s;pare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, &s;hew People their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</HI> And as in Ezek 33 8. 9. <HI>Thou &s;halt hear the word at my Mouth and warn People from me, when I &s;ay unto the wicked, Thou &s;halt &s;urely dye; and thou do&s;t not &s;peak to warn the wicked from his way the wicked &s;hall dye in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand. Neverthele&s;s if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn him from it, if he do not turn from his way, he &s;hall die in his iniquity, but thou ha&s;t delivered thy Soul.</HI> Thus mu&s;t the Mi|ni&s;ters of God warn Sinners about their Sins, again&s;t their Sins, that they may turn from their Sins. They mu&s;t cry with ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, with vehemency, with &s;olemnity again&s;t the Sins and Vices of the Times and Places, wherein they live.</P>
<P>Indeed Sinners don't love to have their Sins cryed again&s;t. And if the Mini&s;ters of God will venture to cry again&s;t the Sins of Sinners, then will Sinners be ready to cry again&s;t the Mini&s;ters of God. And if the Mini&s;ters will not let Sinners alone to Sin quietly and to live in quiet, while they live in Sin, they be &s;ure Sinners will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> let the Mini&s;ters of God alone, to
<PB N="13" REF="001729_0007_0FB77B5F835A0458">
have any quietne&s;s in their Lives o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> any comfort in the World, if they can help it. Did not <HI>Elijah, Eli&s;ha, I&s;aiah, Jeremiah, John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> and the Apo&s;tles of our Lord find it &s;o. But if Mini&s;ters do let Sinners alone to live in Sin, to Sin as they plea&s;e, then God will not let Mini&s;ters no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sinners alone very long They &s;hall nei|ther of them enjoy any long time of quiet|ne&s;s. For,</P>
<P>So lies the ca&s;e. If Sinners will Sin a|gain&s;t God, and God &s;end his Mini&s;ters among them, He will have them to cry again&s;t their Sins. But if the Mini&s;ters of God will not cry again&s;t the Sins of Sin|ners, but will be &s;ilent, then will Sinners be in danger of peri&s;hing in their Sins: but negligent Mini&s;ters mu&s;t an&s;wer for the Souls of the peri&s;hing Sinners. Their blood will be required at the hands of tho&s;e that &s;hould have cryed and given them warning, that they might have turned from their Sins: Therefore the Mini&s;ters of God mu&s;t not dare, for their Lives, to be Silent; They mu&s;t cry again&s;t Sin, if they love their own Souls. They mu&s;t be as Trumpets thorow which the Lords voice cryes unto Sinners. Thus there is the cry of the Word, by which the Lord is plea&s;ed to warn Sinners, that they may turn from
<PB N="14" REF="001729_0008_0FB77B67CEF55C68">
Sin, &s;o as to prevent his Judgments from coming.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes notwith&s;tanding all the cryes of the voice of the Lord by his Word, Sinners will go on &s;till in their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. But what comes then?</P>
<P>Then,</P>
<P>Sometimes the Lord warns by His Rod And therefore is it &s;aid, <HI>Hear ye the rod an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> who hath appointed it.</HI> If Sinners will not hear the Word of God, then comes the Rod of God. If the cry of the Word be de&s;pi&s;ed, then the &s;mart of the rod mu&s;t be endured. Le&s;&s;er Judgments come to war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sinners of greater Judgments coming i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> they continue Impenitent, if they are no Reformed by le&s;&s;er Judgments. The rod comes to tell that the Sword is coming, in Sinners will not be per&s;waded of the rod to for&s;ake their Sins. For when God hath begun his controver&s;y with Sinners, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> may expect that he will go on, to fini&s;h in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, if they will not be Re|formed they mu&s;t be ruined. The Lord will overcome when He judgeth. Thus we find it with the People of God, of old, it the fore-mentioned 26th of <HI>Leviticus,</HI> and 28th of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> and in divers other Places of Scripture we find that they were told that if they would not hear the Words
<PB N="15" REF="001729_0008_0FB77B67CEF55C68">
of God, they &s;hould feel the rod of God. There &s;hould come le&s;&s;er Judgments, and if they did not reclaim them, then there &s;hould come greater Judgments. And if they would not be Reformed by the Lord, by the&s;e Judgments, then He would puni&s;h them yet Seven times more for their Sins. The Lord would break the Pride of their Power, and would &s;end the Sword to a|venge the quarrel of his Covenant. So af|terwards we find, the Lord began with them as a Moth, by le&s;&s;er Judgments con&s;uming of them; and then went on as a Lyon, by greater Judgments, devouring of them. So the Lord is plea&s;ed to deal with Sinners. The Word cryes unto Sinners. <HI>You have Sinned again&s;t God, Oh! Turn from Sin, left God bring his rod.</HI> But if the Sinners do not turn from Sin, then they may ju&s;tly look for the rod. And when the rod comes, then the rod cryes unto Sinners <HI>Oh! The Word of God has been de&s;pi&s;ed therefore is the Rod come Take heed, le&s;t you de&s;pi&s;e the rod: For if you don't hear the Rod, the Sword may come next</HI> The cry of a le&s;&s;er Judg|ment, is, Oh! Be Reformed by this le&s;t a greater come. And if there be no Re|formation, a greater does come, and if Sin|ners continue &s;till incorrigible, it may be &s;till complained according to <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 9 11.
<PB N="16" REF="001729_0009_0FB77B6952517018">
The Lord hath brought &s;ad things upon his People, they are environed with Ene|mies; they know not which way to turn, they are exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, yet, <HI>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is &s;tretched out &s;till: For the People turneth not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him that &s;miteth them, neither do they &s;eek the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> By the&s;e things we learn that God is plea&s;ed to give warning to Sin|ners, before He brings Judgments upon them He warns by his Word, before he &s;trikes with his Rod. And by le&s;&s;er Judg|ments coming, He warns that greater will come, unle&s;s there be amendment by le&s;&s;er. So it is commonly with a People external|ly in Covenant with God. He &s;peaks by the Word for their In&s;truction, before he &s;mites with the Rod for their Correction: or &s;trikes with the Sword for their De|&s;truction.

&s;hould be alwayes de&s;igned by all that Preach, and by all that hear the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, &s;ome of the la&s;t words of &s;everal Dying Per&s;ons are now to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The la&s;t words of Dying Per&s;ons have been frequently e&s;teemed con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Of the Per&s;ons, that we are now to con|&s;ider &s;ome of the la&s;t words; One was a very bad man, he had lived wickedly and then he dyed wofully; he continued wick|ed unto the end of his Life, and was very mi&s;erable in his Death, at his la&s;t. Ano|ther had been a very bad man too long, but before his Death, he became a very good Man, he &s;hewed and proved, beyond all contradiction, before he dyed, that he was a very good Man; he had the Appro|bation, the Atte&s;tation of Truth it &s;elf, that he was become really good. So that tho' &s;ome of the circum&s;tances of his death were very doleful, yet he dyed happily he was un&s;peakably happy in his Death at his End. The Other was the very bell Man that ever lived, that ever dyed; H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was more than a meer Man, He was God as well as Man, the Almighty Saviour of Men. Therefore his words, be &s;ure, fir&s;t and la&s;t and all of them are mo&s;t worthy of our Serious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="001729_0039_0FB77BDE51F0E928">
Among the Ancient Predictions about our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, regi&s;tred in the holy Bible, it was foretold by the Prophetical Evangeli&s;t, the Evangelical Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> [who&s;e Name &s;ignifies, <HI>The Salvation of the Lord.</HI> And &s;o clearly does he propo&s;e the Methods of Salvation for Sinners, by our anointed Lord, and &s;o plainly does he de&s;cribe the Per&s;on, who is the Author of eternal Salvation, that he may well wear that Name, He foretold,] in the conclu|&s;ion of the Fifty-third Chapter of his book, That the Lord, our Saviour, &s;hould be numbred with Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, while he bare the Sin of Multitudes, and made In|terce&s;&s;ion for Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Now we find that all the Four Evangeli&s;ts, who wrote the Life and Death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, have taken expre&s;s notice of the Punctual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ul|filment of this Remarkable Prediction.</P>
<P>There were two notable Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors crucifyed with our Saviour, while he was hanging on the Cro&s;s, bearing the Sins of all Multitudes of his People, making Interce&s;&s;ion for the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors that Cru|cifyed him. One Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or was hang|ing on his Right Hand, another Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or was hanging on his Left Hand, He being placed between them, as if he had been the wickede&s;t of all Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="001729_0040_0FB77BDFCA4D0238">
One of tho&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors continued Impenitent, manife&s;ted his impenitence in the time of his Crucifixion, dyed a mi&s;e|rable Impenitent.'</P>
<P>The other of tho&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors di&s;co|vered him&s;elf a true Penitent, evidenced his Repentance in the time of his Cruci|fixion, dyed a truly repenting Believer.</P>
<P>Whether he was a true Convert before his being guilty of the crime, for which he was Crucifyed, or whether he might be Converted after his Apprehen&s;ion, before his Condemnation; or after his Condem|nation, before his being brought unto the Place of Execution; or whether he might receive the Principle of Saving Grace, and might begin the exerci&s;e of Repentance, after he was nailed to, and hanging on the Cro&s;s; are all of them things not &s;o ea&s;ily and certainly to be determined, as that he was a true Penitent, before he dyed, when|&s;oever he began to Repent. We have as clear evidence that he was a true Penitent, as we have concerning any Per&s;on, that we read of in the whole Book of God. We are &s;ure and certain that he was a true Pe|nitent. Some of the &s;ure &s;igns, the certain tokens of his Repentance are to be con&s;ide|red by us, with &s;ome other con&s;iderable things, in the Sermon that is now Preaching.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="001729_0040_0FB77BDFCA4D0238">
Our Text may be divided, according to the Two Parts of the Speech of the Peni|tent Sinner mentioned in the Text. And both Parts of his Speech have &s;everal things in them, well worthy of our Ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have the Speech of the Penitent Sinner unto his Impenitent Companion, with the occa&s;ion of that part of his Speech.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of his Speech to his Com|panion, was the railing expre&s;&s;ion of his Companion again&s;t the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is &s;aid, <HI>One of the Malefactors, which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iled at him, &s;aying, If thou be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Chri&s;t, &s;ave thy &s;elf and us.</HI></P>
<P>If the other Malefactor joyned with him, for a while, in reviling of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or doubting whether he were the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, yet we are &s;ure that he Repented of that wickedne&s;s, that &s;inful In belief, or disbelieving or que&s;tioning the. Truth of the Word of God. But there is room for us to &s;uppo&s;e that he did not joyn with him at all, in his Unbelieving di&s;|cour&s;e, nor &s;o much as countenance him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all in his railing expre&s;&s;ion; or at mo&s;t, not any more than his Silence from re|proving him for a while, might &s;eem, in the apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome of the by-Stan|ders, to countenance him in his Ungodli|ne&s;s;
<PB N="80" REF="001729_0041_0FB77BE305150298">
however, certain it is, he did &s;uffici|ently clear him&s;elf, at la&s;t, from all com|munion with him, in his Impiety. For his Speech to his Companion will be his own everla&s;ting Vindication. It will be a per|petual Te&s;timony for him, that he was en|tirely &s;eparated from the Sin of that Sin|ner, if he had, for any time, at all partaken with him in his Sin. He &s;hewed that he would no longer have any fellow&s;hip with him in his wicked expre&s;&s;ion, but rather would rebuke him for the wickedne&s;s of his words. When his Companion &s;he was his Impenitence by his wicked words, he would not &s;uffer tho&s;e wicked words to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> unrebuked.</P>
<P>And in his rebuking of his Companion, for his Impenitence, he di&s;covers that he had him&s;elf truly Repented, when he &s;ayes, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not thou fear God, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ome Condemnation?</HI> As if he had &s;aid:</P>
<P><Q>If all this great Multitude of People &s;hould have &s;o little of the fear of God in them, as to revile an innocent Per&s;on &s;uffering here, yet THOU &s;houlde&s;t have more of the fear of God in thee, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> revile this innocent Per&s;on. If thou ha&s;t no fear of Man, yet &s;houlde&s;t thou have &s;o much to the fear of God, as to keep thee from adding Sin to Sin. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="81" REF="001729_0041_0FB77BE305150298">
ha&s;t no Love to God, yet the pre&s;ent Ex|ecution of his wrath upon thee, &s;hould produce in thee &s;ome fear of God, &s;o as to hinder thee from going on Impeni|tently in thy wickedne&s;s. Yea, what thou now feele&s;t of the terrible impre&s;&s;i|ons of the Ju&s;tice of God upon thee, in bearing the Temporal Mi&s;eries, to which thou art condemned by Man, &s;hould make thee fear the more terrible impre&s;|&s;ions of the Divine Ju&s;tice upon thee in bearing tho&s;e Eternal Mi&s;eries, to which thou de&s;erve&s;t to be condemned by God, &s;o as to con&s;ider how thou maye&s;t be delivered from his anger for ever. Thy &s;ufferings now are dreadful, but they will quickly be more dreadful, if thou do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t not fear God &s;o as to u&s;e all Means to e&s;cape his everla&s;ting indignation.</Q> So does he advi&s;e and reprove his Impeni|tent Companion.</P>
<P>But here is not all the evidence of his own Repentance, for he does not only re|buke his Companion for his wickedne&s;s, but he al&s;o acknowledges the Ju&s;tice of their Puni&s;hment; <HI>They were ju&s;tly condem|ned, for they received the due reward of their deeds.</HI> And he ju&s;tifies the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, acknowledging that <HI>He had done no|thing ami&s;s.</HI> Nor is this all the evidence of
<PB N="82" REF="001729_0042_0FB77BE447D153D8">
his Repentance, We have yet farther evi|dence in the other Part of his Speech, that he truly Repented.  For,</P>
<P N="2">2. We have the Speech of the Penitent Sinner unto his Merciful Redeemer; with the con&s;equent of that Part of his Speech. He &s;ayes to Chri&s;t, Lord <HI>remember me when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom.</HI> He had ac|knowledged that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was true Man, while he was confe&s;&s;ing his in|nocence. <HI>This Man hath done nothing ami&s;s</HI> But now he acknowledges that he is true God, while he is de&s;iring his Mercy: he calls him <HI>Lord,</HI> Commits and Submits him|&s;elf of his di&s;po&s;al; he owns that he into King, that he hath a Kingdom, that he was to come into his Kingdom; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had Power to admit whom he plea&s;ed into his Kingdom; that he could bring the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Sinner into his Kingdom, as ea&s;ily as think upon him: and he hum|bly de&s;ires the lowe&s;t degree of Mercy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> good thought, that he might be kindly thought upon, that the Merciful Saviour would Mercifully Remember him, when he came into his Kingdom. Thus hum|bly Prayes the Penitent Sinner.</P>
<P>The gracious and comforting an&s;wer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer immediately follows this humble Prayer of the Penitent
<PB N="83" REF="001729_0042_0FB77BE447D153D8">
Sinner. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, To day, thou &s;halt be with me in Paradi&s;e.</HI> It means, that immediately after the &s;eparation of his Soul from his Body, he &s;hould be lodged in a Place of happi|ne&s;s, in a State of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and &s;hould certainly be brought unto the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he humbly de&s;ired; he &s;hould be re|membred by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when he came into his Kingdom. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t would have him a&s;&s;ured, that he would not forget him, and fully &s;atis|fyed that he would Mercifully Remember him. As if he had &s;aid, <HI>Poor Soul, don't fear that I &s;hall forget thee, I'le certainly Remember thee, and thou &s;halt be &s;en&s;ible of it, this very day, to thy un&s;peakable Con&s;olation.</HI> Oh! Then let us think well &amp; &s;peak well about our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom we find thus ready &amp; willing, in the time of his own bitter &s;orrows, to &s;hew compa&s;&s;ion to a mi&s;erable Sinner. What greater encou|ragement for Faith in Chri&s;t, Repentance of Sin, Prayer to God, can be de&s;ired, than to have the Lord nigh to us, in all that we call upon him for, and to hear us, and help us, and be&s;tow upon us all that we can de|&s;ire, as &s;oon as we de&s;ire it; yea, to do for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> exceeding abundantly above all that we can a&s;k or think?</P>

The Day of Judgment will be the mo&s;t glorious Day of God, that ever has been: Then will the glorious Perfections of the ever glorious GOD &s;hine forth mo&s;t glori|ou&s;ly, before the whole World of Men and Angels, in &s;uch a manner, as never before. But next unto the Day of Judgment where|in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will appear upon a glorious Throne, The Day whereon our Lord hanged on the Cro&s;s, may &s;eem the mo&s;t wonderful Day.</P>
<P>For as at the Day of Judgment, there will be &s;ome &s;tanding Condemned at One Hand of the glorious Judge, and &s;ome Ac|quitted on the other Hand; &s;o on the Day of our Lords Crucifixion, There was one, Impenitent, on one &s;ide of Him, and another Penitent, on the other &s;ide of Him.</P>
<P>And as at the Day of Judgment, the Grace of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will appear glorious in the Salvation of them that are Saved; and his Ju&s;tice will appear glori|ous in the De&s;truction of them that are Condemned. So in the time of his Cru|cifixion, He appeared glorious both in his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in his Mercy; Righte|ou&s;ly &s;uffering one Sinner to continue Im|penitent in his wickedne&s;s, &amp; leaving him to Peri&s;h in his Impenitence; and merci|fully enclining &amp; enabling another Sinner

Yet one remained Impenitent, manife&s;ted his Impenitence, proceeded in Sinning again&s;t God. The other appeared Penitent, manife&s;ted his Repentance, gave glorious demon&s;trations, that he &s;incerely Repented of his wicked|ne&s;s, confe&s;&s;ed his Sin, acknowledged the Ju&s;tice of God in his Puni&s;hment, pleaded for the Innocence of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, believed in him for Salvation, &s;hewed the Truth of his Faith by his humble Prayer to the Lord, profe&s;&s;ed Him before all People; there pre&s;ent, had a &s;peedy, gracious glori|ous, wonderful &amp; Soul-&s;atisfying an&s;wer to his Prayer: A full demon&s;tration of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; &s;incerity of his Repentance.

<P>This comes to pa&s;s by the Sovereign di&s;po&s;al of the All-wi&s;e God, who is not obliged to give an account about any of his Matters, unto any of his Creatures.

<P>Yet we are not excu&s;ed from &s;erious di|ligence, in all &s;uitable endeavours, to get good by all the Means of Grace, tho' Sal|vation be not infallibly annexed to tho&s;e means.

<HEAD>DOCT II. Impenitent Sinners would be Saved from Eternal Mi&s;ery, without any Regard to the Glory of God in their Sal|vation.</HEAD>
<P>There is in all Rational Creatures a Na|tural de&s;ire of Happine&s;s, or Freedom from Mi&s;ery. They would not be Eternally Mi&s;erable. The wor&s;t of Sinners have &s;ome &s;ort to de&s;ire to be Ea&s;y and Happy for ever. They think, they pretend, they would be Saved and go to Heaven. They would not be Damned nor go to Hell. If they mu&s;t leave this World; when they leave it, they would not go to a place of Torment, but to a place of Comfort.</P>
<P>But as for all Impenitent Sinners, while they remain Impenitent, they do not &s;in|cerely de&s;ire the Glory of God in their Sal|vation. The Impenitent Malefactor on the Cro&s;s cryed, <HI>If thou be the Chri&s;t, &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> thy &s;elf and us.</HI> He Prayed, after a manner for Salvation, for him&s;elf and his Compa|nion. He de&s;ired that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t would &s;hew Him&s;elf to be the Pro|mi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> by delivering Him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the hands of His Enemies, and from His pre&s;ent Sufferings, and by appearing for the Salvation of him&s;elf and his Compa|nion

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> pre&s;ent Mi&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> regard for the Glory of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> might be Glori|fyed in their Salvation.</P>
<P>So it is with all Impenitent Sinners, might they live in Sin for ever, and be free from Mi&s;ery: they would have no con|cernment about being Saved to Glorify God: they would be contented to live in Sin for ever, to the di&s;honour of God. This is the di&s;po&s;ition of all Impenitent Sinners Univer&s;ally.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;ome Sinners do, more plainly, di&s;cover this di&s;po&s;ition, than &s;ome other Sinners. But all Impenitent Sinners have &s;o much of this ungodly di&s;po&s;ition pre|vailing in them, as long as they are Impe|nitent, that might they be Saved and Freed from Eternal Mi&s;ery, let who will be con|cerned for the Glory of God, they take no care about Glorifying God.</P>
<P>Thence it is, partly, that &s;o many Sin|ners do &s;o Shamefully and Wickedly put off the Work of their Souls, from time to time, and follow their &s;inful cour&s;es, until they think they are near Dying, and then they begin to think &s;omething mu&s;t be done, to get ready for Death, to make their Peace with God, that He may be willing to take their Souls into Happine&s;s, when
<PB N="94" REF="001729_0048_0FB77BFC4FEEF6D8">
they go out of this Mi&s;erable World. They de&s;ire that God would take them to Him&s;elf, now they think, they can live no longer. But if God remove the occa|&s;ion of their pre&s;ent fear of Dying, and they &s;eem like to live longer; they can pre|&s;ently take to the &s;ame Cour&s;e of Sin, that they were in before, they go on &s;till in their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. They are not concerned For the Glory of God in their Salvation. All the Salvation that they de&s;ire, might be &s;eparated from the Glory of God.</P>
<P>And &s;o &s;ome, that &s;eem to be Mightily concerned for &s;ome of the Means of Sal|vation, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Privileges, the Seal|ing Ordinances of God, Bapti&s;m and the Supper of the Lord to be Admini&s;tred to them&s;elves and to others, they are fre|quently too little concerned for the Glory of God. If they might be admitted to Evangelical Privileges, they would be contented to live in their Sins, to the di&s;ho|nour of God, and the reproach of Religion. So, it &s;eems, it was with &s;ome of the Hearers of <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, and therefore he ad|vi&s;ed them to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, if they de&s;ired to be Baptized now they were up grown. So they that de&s;ire Go&s;pel Privileges, in a Church State now, mu&s;t be concerned to prepare
<PB N="95" REF="001729_0048_0FB77BFC4FEEF6D8">
for tho&s;e Privileges, that they may Glorify God in their injoyment of them. They mu&s;t endeavour that there may be, at lea&s;t, room to hope that they do &s;incerely de&s;ire to turn from all Sin to God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to live holily by the Grace of Chri&s;t, and to follow and perfect Holine&s;s in the fear of God, for the Glory of God; before they can be regularly admitted unto the Table of the Lord, or unto Bapti&s;m, if they are come to years of under&s;tanding.

<P>Indeed, it would be a very awful thing, if any People, Profe&s;&s;ing the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, &s;hould be overwhelmed with &s;uch Enthu&s;ia&s;tical Prophanity, as to live con|tentedly without the Holy Ordinances of God, and without any care to prepare for tho&s;e Ordinances, and without any &s;en&s;e of any need of any Preparation for them, and yet think that things are well e|nough with their Souls, tho' they live in di&s;obedience to the plain, expre&s;s, po&s;itive Commands of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But it would be a no le&s;s awful thing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y People, pretending to Chri&s;tianity &s;hould be carried away with &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Formality, as to de&s;ire that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Or|dinances of God &s;hould be pro&s;tituted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>Nor would it &s;eem well, if any Per&s;ons, manife&s;ting a Zeal for God, &s;hould igno|rantly encourage poor Sinners to any &s;uch impiety. For how can they think that the Lord will hold them guiltle&s;s?</P>
<P>For we &s;hould be concerned for the Glory of God, in all the remarkable En|terpri&s;es of our whole Conver&s;ation, but peculiarly in our attending of the Holy Ordinances of His In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip. And it is not for the Glory of God, for us to neglect the Ordinances of God, pre|tending that we are not fit for them. Herein we Rebel again&s;t God. Nor is it for the Glory of God for us to abu&s;e the Ordinances of God by Pro&s;tituting them to the Lu&s;ts of Sinners, in Admini&s;tring them to tho&s;e, that by their clearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to

Ordinances; This would be to Reproach the Lord, who is Glorious in Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>But it will be for the Glory of God, if we mourn for our negligence and care|le&s;sne&s;s about our Preparation for the Or|dinances of God, and beg Pardon for all our &s;inful Omi&s;&s;ions, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, and Pray for Grace that we may be pre|pared for the Ordinances of God, accor|ding to the Directions of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>And when we are &s;o prepared, it will be for the Glory of God, for us to de&s;ire to have them Admini&s;tred unto us, according to the Rules of His Word. This would be for the Glory of God &amp; for the Honour of His People in this World and for their Welfare for ever.</P>
<P>But if People are not concerned for the Glory of God, in their Salvation, He will take care for His own Glory, in their con|fu&s;ion. For He has declared in Lev. 10. 3. <HI>I will be Sanctified in them, that come nigh me, and before all the People I will be Glorified.</HI> Then if God intends our Salvation, He will make us concerned for His Glory.</P>

If People did rightly Fear God, they would Repent of Sin.

<HEAD>DOCT. IV. Penitent Sinners will De&s;ire and Labour that other Sinners may be brought unto Repentance.</HEAD>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition appears in the Peni|tent Sinner on the Cro&s;s; one of the fir&s;t Evidences of His Repentance, was this, he rebuked his Companion for his wicked|ne&s;s, and laboured to excite him to Fear God, and &s;hewed him that there was great rea&s;on for Him to Fear God now he was under Condemnation for his wicked|ne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>DOCT. VI. The Truth of Repentance for Sin &s;hould be di&s;covered in Penitent Sin|ners, not only by their Serious Concernment for the good of others and the Glory of God, as well as their own good; but al&s;o by their Humblene&s;s before God, and their Thankful|ne&s;s unto God.</HEAD>
<P>They mu&s;t humbly refer them&s;elves un|to the Sovereign Plea&s;ure of God, and Thankfully accept and improve the lea&s;t Mercy from God. So the Penitent Sin|ner in our Text, not only endeavours to reclaim his Impenitent Companion from his unrea&s;onable Wickedne&s;s, but he al&s;o &s;en&s;ibly acknowledges the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, in the Puni&s;hments that were come on them for their Wickedne&s;s. And he humbly Prays unto the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and humbly Submits him&s;elf unto the Will of that Glorious Lord, and &s;hews a willingne&s;s to be contented with the lea&s;t Mercy that might be conferred on him, and waits on the Lord for His own Time to know His Will. So Hum|ble, &s;o Thankful was he in his Repentance:</P>
<P>We might here &s;ay, that the Penitent Sinner on the Cro&s;s, having Preached a good Sermon, he then made a good Prayer, in the hearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. His Ser|mon was Occa&s;ioned by what was La|mentable,
<PB N="112" REF="001729_0057_0FB77A85560659F8">
the Railing Language of a Sin|ful Creature at our Suffering Saviour. His Prayer was an&s;wered with what was Com|fortable, the Gracious Promi&s;e of our Mer|ciful Saviour to a Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Sinner.</P>
<P>The Converted Sinner concerned for the Glory of God, perceiving his Uncon|verted Companion to be in a very bad Frame under his terrible Sufferings, for his heinous Wickedne&s;s, he Preaches unto him an Excellent Sermon to promote his Repentance toward God, endeavour|ing to Excite him unto a Con&s;ideration of his Duty, under his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Circum|&s;tances, advi&s;ing him to Evidence more of the Fear of God, than had hitherto ap|peared in his Language, and to con&s;ider and Acknowledge the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in the Puni&s;hment that was Inflicted upon them both for their Wickedne&s;s. And then he Preaches about the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, declaring His Righteou&s;ne&s;s, while he Condemned him&s;elf and his Com|panion for their own Wickedne&s;s, and manife&s;ted an acceptation of the Pu|ni&s;hment of his own Wickedne&s;s, and would have his Companion to be &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble of his Ill de&s;erving that he might ac|cept of the Puni&s;hment of his Wickedne&s;s. Thus he Preached to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Companion.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="001729_0057_0FB77A85560659F8">
But it is po&s;&s;ible that the Penitent Sin|ner, &s;eeing little or no Evidence of Re|pentance in his Companion, he then Ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and makes unto him an Excellent Prayer, to entreat His Compa&s;&s;ion for his own Soul. But probably with an earne&s;t De|&s;ire &s;till for the Welfare of the Soul of his Companion; for he &s;o Expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in his Prayer, that his Companion might be encouraged to Believe in the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t. He plainly di&s;covers before all People, his own firm Confidence in the Tender Compa&s;&s;ions of his Gracious Lord, &s;o that he could venture the Ever|la&s;ting Affairs of his never-dying Soul with Him. This might have been for the Encouragement of his Companion. How|ever, in his Prayer, <HI>Lord, Remember me, when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom;</HI> he Ac|knowledges the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be the Son of God, the Saviour of Souls, and the King of Heaven; that He was then going into His Kingdom, that if He had but a kind Thought about him, and would but think upon him with Compa&s;&s;ion, it would be to his Advantage; and he is contented with the &s;malle&s;t Mercy, a kind Thought: And he de&s;ires this Kindne&s;s of the Lord, when he &s;hould come into
<PB N="114" REF="001729_0058_0FB77A89466A41F8">
His Kingdom. He would wait His Will about the Time and Way for the be&s;towing of any the lea&s;t Mercy that He &s;hould &s;ee cau&s;e to be&s;tow upon him. Thus he Prayed to his Redeemer.</P>
<P>Now for the USE of this Doctrine.</P>
<P>Let all Per&s;ons thus di&s;cover the Truth of Repentance for Sin, imitate the Pe|nitent Sinner on the Cro&s;s. in his di&s;cove|ring of his Repentance for Sin.</P>
<P>It is not enough to &s;ay, that you have Faith in your Souls, toward the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t; nor is it enough to &s;ay, that you have Repentance toward God in your hearts; but you mu&s;t endeavour to &s;atisfy others, that you do truly Repent.</P>
<P>All Sinners have di&s;honoured God, by Sinning again&s;t Him. They &s;hould there|fore endeavour to honour Him by Repen|ting of their Sins. But &s;ome of their Sins have been committed before others, they &s;hould therefore endeavour that others may know, as well about their Repentance for Sin, as they have known about their Com|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin. The Salve &s;hould cover the Sore: and if the Sins of any Per&s;ons have been openly committed, then &s;hould Repentance for tho&s;e their Sins, be openly evidenced.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="001729_0058_0FB77A89466A41F8">
And if God hath, in His Holy Provi|dence, brought Sinners out upon the Stage of the World, to make them to be Exam|ples unto others, then it is their Duty to Glorify God before the World, by con|fe&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e their more Secret Sins, that have Provoked the Lord to leave them unto the more Open Sins, that have ex|po&s;ed them before the World; that others may be warned again&s;t, and &s;o pre&s;erved from the like Out-breakings into Sin, &s;o as to prevent further Di&s;honour from coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Holy Name of God, by Open Sin|ning.

<P>If Sinners have neglected Secret Prayer to God, or grown &s;lack to, or cold in, or carele&s;s about, any other Duty of Godli|ne&s;s, and God has puni&s;hed them for their &s;ecret Neglects, by His leaving them to fall into more Open Sin, that brings them under publick Shame, they &s;hould ac|knowledge how they began to leave God, and &s;hould acknowledge the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in leaving them, and &s;hould there|withal advi&s;e others to take heed, le&s;t they begin to leave God, by giving way to &s;e|cret Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion, that are often pu|ni&s;hed by the guilty Sinners being left unto Open Sins of Commi&s;&s;ion, that bring the woful Sinners at la&s;t unto Open Pu|ni&s;hment.

<P>And if Sinners know, and can truly charge them&s;elves, that they have not kept &s;uch a Guard as they &s;hould have kept, on their Tongues, nor had &s;o much care of Truth, as they &s;hould have had in their &s;peech, but have &s;ometimes talked too much at random, without the Fear of God; and God hath puni&s;hed them for that their Wickedne&s;s, by leaving them to more grievous and ruining Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; They &s;hould warn others to take heed to their Ways, that they Sin not with their Tongues, but keep their Tongues from E|vil, and their Lips from &s;peaking Guile.</P>

And beg of God, that whatever He de|nies you, yet you may not be Deceived about your Soul, &s;o as to lo&s;e your Soul for ever; that whatever He denies you, yet you may be remembred by the Mer|ciful Redeemer, and received into His Kingdom, tho' a Mi&s;erable Sinner. And if it &s;hould be &s;o, that after all your En|deavours about your Soul, the Righteous and Holy Lord &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e to hide the Light of His Countenance from your Soul, &s;o that you mu&s;t go out of this World in the Dark, without any com|fortable Satisfaction of his being Recon|ciled to your Soul, or A&s;&s;urance of the Pardon of your Sins; yet be &s;ure to Ju&s;ti|fy Him in all, Acknowlege His Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s to the la&s;t; and try to keep the Eyes of your Soul upon the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, remembring that He is able to Save unto the uttermo&s;t, all that come to God thro' Him, &s;eeing He ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for them, and

He can Save at the La&s;t. And remember what the Penitent Sinner on the Cro&s;s hath Experienced, at the La&s;t, for your Encou|ragement. God can take from the Cro&s;s into Paradi&s;e, and from the Gallows in|to Glory; and He can help you &s;o to Re|pent of all your Sins that you may Glo|rify Him before you Dye.</P>
<P>And &s;o far as you may be Encouraged by this (and this may be &s;ome Encou|ragement) you may be &s;atisfyed, that they that Fear God will not cea&s;e to Pray to the Lord for you. They will continue to take all proper Sea&s;ons, both in Publick now, and in Private and in Secret to Pray for you, as long as you continue a proper Subject for Prayer. But if you would have any &s;aving benefit by their Prayers, you mu&s;t be &s;ure to continue to take all Times to Pray for your &s;elf, and continue Repenting of Sin as long as you Live, and continue Believing on Chri&s;t as long as you Breath, and keep longing for &s;uch Manife&s;tations of Gods Love in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us unto your own Soul, that you may be able truly to &s;ay (as in P&s;al. 49. 15.) <HI>God will redeem my Soul from Hell, and he will receive me.</HI></P>
