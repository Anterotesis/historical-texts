<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE CANDID READER.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS at the earne&s;t de&s;ire of the church people in <HI>Great-Barrington,</HI> and not from any inclination of appearing in print, I &s;end the following plain and inelegant di&s;cour&s;e abroad; and as there are &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in it, may appear har&s;h, and the facts they relate to, improbable in a land of li|berty, and where the oppre&s;&s;ors can ju&s;tly claim but toleration, I think it expedient to adverti&s;e the reader of tho&s;e facts, and then leave him to judge of the expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Some of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the town of <HI>Great-Bar|rington</HI> were <HI>Dutch</HI> people, who profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and engaged and paid a <HI>Lutheran</HI> mini&s;|ter for coming among them four times every year. When the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came among them, they joined in &s;ettling two di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters, and contributed largely to build the meeting-hou&s;es in <HI>Great-Bar|rington</HI> and <HI>Sheffield;</HI> but could receive no benefit from either, as they did not believe the principles of <HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> con&s;tantly taught in both, and could not

have their children baptized unle&s;s they would openly profe&s;s it.&mdash;Being de&s;irous, their children &s;hould re|ceive the &s;acred ordinance of bapti&s;m, they were obliged to go thirty or forty miles to a <HI>Lutheran</HI> mi|ni&s;ter, for that purpo&s;e. Seeing they received no advantage from the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, and hired one of their own, they applied to the town to con|&s;ider their circum&s;tances, and to allow them a part of the taxes they paid Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> to help pay their own mini&s;ter for vi&s;iting them; but this rea&s;on|able de&s;ire was rejected with di&s;dain, and invectives: However they made no di&s;turbance, but attended Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI>'s meeting, until he compelled them to leave it, by preaching the mi&s;terious notions of ab|&s;olute and irre&s;pective decrees, and the augmenta|tion of good and happine&s;s to the moral &s;y&s;tem, by the introduction and abounding of &s;in, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon this they became unea&s;y, and told him they could not, in con&s;cience, come to hear, and have their chil|dren learn &s;uch doctrines for the go&s;pel. Some of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> laboured under the &s;ame unea&s;ine&s;s, and could not admit the doctrines he con&s;tantly taught, to be true, and according to the revealed will of GOD: Neverthele&s;s if he believed them, he might preach them, but he ought not to compel others to hear and learn them; which however was in &s;ome mea&s;ure the fact; for when &s;ome who were di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied, ab&s;ented for a few days from his meeting, he in&s;tigated, from his de&s;k, his people to pro&s;ecute them with the utmo&s;t rigour of the law: The con&s;e|quence was, &s;everal aged and &s;ober men were put into the &s;tocks, and two into the public goal;&mdash;their crimes were very atrocious, they could not, in con|&s;cience, come to hear preached what they could not believe;&mdash;but they were <HI>Lutherans.</HI>&mdash;One <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI>

Mr. <HI>Hamlin,</HI> was more criminal, yet, he was old, &s;ick and lame, &s;o that he could not go abroad; but then he was a churchman.

The church people began, and be|fore the rates for another year were due, as I think, they rai&s;ed a large and elegant church, and hired a young candidate for the mini&s;try, as a reader, and &s;teadily attended the wor&s;hip of the church. Seeing they had expended &s;o much money, for the church, and in every re&s;pect were known profe&s;&s;ors thereof, 'twas pre&s;umed they would now forego obliging them to pay to Mr. <HI>Hopkins;</HI> but like tho&s;e which the wi&s;e man tells us are never &s;atisfied, they more &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon the rates, and becau&s;e the money could not be rai&s;ed exactly when called for, &s;ome had their goods di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and &s;old, at under rates; and ten of the more aged and &s;ober men, were &s;ent to the public goal, until the rates were paid. Time would fail me to relate the particular aggrevations which attended the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions; the&s;e are ea&s;ily conceived, when the characters of the op|pre&s;&s;ors are known.

people have unanimou&s;ly proceeded, and have ex|pended large &s;ums of money,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a piece wrote at <HI>Great-Barrington,</HI> and publi&s;hed in the <HI>Bo&s;ton Gazette, September</HI> 17, 1764, it is a&s;&s;erted, that <Q>the per|&s;ons who are at the chief expence in this undertaking (that is in building the church) declared for the church of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>e&s;cape rates,</HI> and <HI>&s;ave</HI> money.</Q> 'Tis evident the author ran foul of truth with his eyes open, it being &s;aid by the di&s;&s;enters that the churchmen will ruin their e&s;tates in building their church.

Now whoever will candidly and impartially con&s;ider the&s;e facts, and as being done in land of profe&s;&s;ed freedom, and by a people who can ju&s;tly claim for them&s;elves but toleration, will not think any expre&s;&s;ions in the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e, &s;arca&s;tical or &s;evere.</P>

<P>As to manner or method, it begins with &s;ome &s;elected texts of &s;cripture read by the mini&s;ter, toge|ther with a &s;olemn exhortation to all pre&s;ent; which puts them in mind of what tho&s;e texts declare, and al&s;o of all the &s;ucceeding parts of duty which they meet to perform; calling upon them, with one heart and voice, to the fir&s;t part of prayer, which imme|diately en&s;ues; by which means all have <HI>time,</HI> and <HI>means,</HI> to compo&s;e their minds, and to con&s;ider <HI>where</HI> and <HI>what</HI> we are, and the bu&s;ine&s;s we are going about, which is to kneel down, and unitedly to con|fe&s;s our &s;ins, and to pray for the pardon of them.

The great de&s;ign of erecting this hou&s;e, is to meet and join in the u&s;e of public prayer; but as the knowledge of religion is requi&s;ite, in order for mens becoming religious, and St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hews we come not to this knowledge without teaching, (<HI>Rom.</HI> x. 14) and as all men have not time nor capacity to in&s;truct them&s;elves, therefore, a further de&s;ign, is, that the true principles and duties of our holy religion might be here taught and learned, the &s;um of which religion is contained in the&s;e two terms, <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>repentance.</HI>&mdash;Under the head of faith will be taught, the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> and <HI>attributes</HI> of one eternal, good, wi&s;e, great and &s;elf-exi&s;ting GOD, who created, pre&s;erveth, and governs the univer&s;e, and all creatures; that he is to be adored, loved, and obeyed; that when man had &s;inned, and had expo&s;ed him&s;elf to ju&s;tice and puni&s;hment, incapable of relieving him&s;elf, that GOD &s;o loved the world, that he &s;ent his only begotten &s;on, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life; (<HI>John</HI> iii. 16)&mdash;that he a&s;&s;umed human nature, taught, both by precept and example, mankind, all holy living; died a &s;acra|fice for the &s;ins of the world, and thereby to make peace for us: <Q>And, having made peace through the blood of his cro&s;s, by him to reconcile all things unto him&s;elf, by him I &s;ay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven;</Q> (<HI>Col.</HI> i. 20) and &s;ealed and ratified a covenant of grace, whereby &s;inners may obtain <HI>pardon, grace,</HI> and everla&s;ting &s;alvation. The&s;e particulars will be taught as matters of faith; as nece&s;&s;ary for every one firmly to believe, together with many other con&s;equential principles: Ab&s;tru&s;e and needle&s;s &s;peculations, that tend only to confu&s;e the ignorant, di&s;tract the weak, and advantage none, will be omitted and di&s;carded,

as being contrary to the genius of chri&s;tianity, and the de&s;ign and bu&s;ine&s;s of its mini&s;ters. Under the head of repentance, will, we rea&s;onably expect, be taught, what the grace of GOD, which hath appeared bringing &s;alvation, (<HI>i. e.</HI>) the offers and terms of &s;alvation to all men, teacheth, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that denying un|godline&s;s, and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world; (<HI>Tit.</HI> ii. 12) <HI>i. e.</HI> to quit and turn from all vice and immorality; all profanene&s;s and debauchery; all inju&s;tice, malice, &s;u|per&s;tition, and idolatry; to pray to GOD, for his pardon, and for his grace&punc; to do &s;o no more; but heartily and faithfully to do what he has required; to love, fear, and &s;erve GOD, with all our &s;ouls, and power; to cordially embrace, and &s;tedfa&s;tly believe his revealed <HI>will;</HI> to govern our pa&s;&s;ions, and live in the regular exerci&s;e of our rea&s;on; to love, and do good to our fellow-men every where: Under each of the&s;e particulars are comprehended many other duties, which the preacher will not fail of inculcating, in plain, &s;ober, and engaging words and manners. In a word, we are to expect the plain principles of the go&s;pel, and not the whims and notions of men; the religion and duties which CHRIST our Saviour taught, which is to promote true holine&s;s, and genuine god|line&s;s and hone&s;ty, and not mi&s;terious and u&s;ele&s;s &s;peculations, impracticable and impo&s;&s;ible duties; which make men either proud or de&s;perate, where and when preached and believed.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly repre&s;ented both the wor&s;hip and principles of the church, I &s;hall now as briefly mention the advantages that you may rea&s;onably expect, in con&s;equence of building this hou&s;e, and having the&s;e particulars performed therein. All rea&s;onable actions are done to gain &s;ome de&s;ign and
<PB N="10" REF="009948_0016_0F7B3AB4E94BF1F8">
end; and it may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that you expected the advantages ari&s;ing, would be &s;ufficient to recom|pence you for the co&s;t and trouble you have and will be at; that you would not contentedly &s;uffer &s;o many inconveniencies, <HI>per&s;ecutions,</HI> and more than <HI>ho&s;tile barbarities,</HI> and take &s;o much pains, and ex|pend &s;o much of your intere&s;t, if you had not the pro&s;pect of reaping &s;ome advantage. The motive is good; this has ever been pre&s;ented by the wi&s;e and good parent of nature, to excite and animate man|kind to be religious. The fir&s;t advantage you may expect is the wor&s;hipping GOD almighty, agreeable to your faith, and according to his revealed will.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note, Mr. <HI>Calvin,</HI> and his &s;cholars, make a wide difference in GOD'S revealed and &s;ecret will: by the one, all have the offers of life and &s;alvation; by the other, only a few, and the re&s;t are reprobated by the &s;ame will. Vid. <HI>Cal.</HI> in&s;t. lib. 3. c. 24. <HI>Gill, Cole,</HI> and others.</NOTE> This is mo&s;t certainly a very great benefit, unto all &s;uch as are, by the grace of GOD, willing and en|gaged to join heartily therein. You come here not only to hear another pray, but to attend and join, both with heart and voice, to pray to and prai&s;e your GOD. In other a&s;&s;emblies, you can but hear another pray his own prayer, if that may be called his own which he knows not before he prays, and remembers not afterwards; whereas we ought to pray as well as &s;ing prai&s;es with the &s;pirit and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o, which may be performed here, but as things at pre&s;ent are, cannot be done in the other a&s;&s;emblies in this land.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI>&mdash;You always hear the revealed will of GOD read, a large portion being always appointed, &s;o that you will always when you meet here, certainly hear your GOD &s;peaking and teaching you what to
<PB N="11" REF="009948_0017_0F7B3AB5B174DF98">
believe and do for &s;alvation. In other congrega|tions, the &s;criptures are wholly laid a&s;ide for the preacher to produce &s;omething more plea&s;ing and excellent; ju&s;t as though a glow-worm would yield a more plea&s;ing and advantageous light than the meridian &s;un.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI>&mdash;We commemorate the remarkable events of our &s;aviour CHRIST, particularly his miraculous birth, as upon this ever joyful and memorable day, and for that purpo&s;e we always partake of that holy and valuable in&s;titution, by which we unworthy crea|tures are allowed &s;piritually to eat the fle&s;h and drink the blood of our &s;aviour JESUS CHRIST, and thereby to be evidences of, and to &s;hew forth his death to future ages: And you, my brethren, who de&s;ign this day to come to his holy banquet, &s;hould duly remember your&s;elves, and &s;o to have examined your hearts and repented of your &s;ins, as preparedly to be partakers thereof, that &s;o you may receive &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings from the &s;acred appointer and author.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI>&mdash;Another advantage to be expected, is, that the preacher will entertain and in&s;truct your minds, not with unrea&s;onable mi&s;teries, mere &s;pecula|tive notions, or impracticable duties, which &s;erve only to di&s;tract and bewilder mens under&s;tanding; but that from the exi&s;tence and perfections of one GOD; from the wonderful love and work of one only Saviour; from the agency of one only &s;pirit, he will proceed to explain and enforce the plain duties of a holy life; furni&s;hing your minds with proper argu|ments, and go&s;pel motives, to become truly holy, in heart and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI>&mdash;Another advantage, and that not incon|&s;iderable, will be, that your mini&s;ter will be inve&s;ted with a proper commi&s;&s;ion, and with competent
<PB N="12" REF="009948_0018_0F7B3AB5D9F2D280">
authority from CHRIST, the head of the church, to execute the work of a mini&s;ter among you.</P>
<P>This is an advantage which the <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> in this land can ju&s;tly lay no claim to, unle&s;s every layman has authority to ordain; which appears &s;o glaringly ab&s;urd, that many curious di&s;tinctions are trumped upon the ignorant, and when the&s;e fail, 'tis denied what our Saviour expre&s;sly declared (when he com|mi&s;&s;ioned his apo&s;tles) of <Q>lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world.</Q> Whoever can|didly con&s;iders the fate of the pre&s;umptuous invaders of this office, under the old, and the appointment by CHRIST and his apo&s;tles, under the new te&s;tament, and that for fifteen hundred years after, none but &s;uch as were ordained in this line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, were allowed in the chri&s;tian church, as the hi&s;tory of all ages of the church te&s;tify, will have rea&s;on to e&s;teem it a privilege to be under a mini&s;try which is ju&s;tly unexceptionable in this particular.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, to mention but this one, which crowns all the other advantages, and for to attain this, the others are only de&s;igned as helps and means; in the proper u&s;e of them, through the goodne&s;s and mercy of GOD, by the merits and mediation of JESUS our common Lord and Saviour, you may obtain the pardon of your &s;ins, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ble&s;&s;ings of heaven, peace, unanimity, and contentment in this pre&s;ent world; and in the future, when this mortal &s;hall put on immortality, when contention and male|diction &s;hall be confined to its proper abode, may come the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that everla&s;ting &s;alvation, that incorruptible crown of glory, that heavenly re&s;idence, of <HI>life, light,</HI> and <HI>joy,</HI> which is re&s;erved in heaven for all true and obedient chri&s;tians. This, my brethren, is a prize! worth all your &s;triving; a reward, beyond
<PB N="13" REF="009948_0019_0F7B3AB684CFF2E8">
all your doings for the &s;ervice of GOD, and promo|tion of religion; an advantage, that will more, infi|nitely more, than recompence you, for all the <HI>&s;coffs, ridicule, hatred, oppo&s;ition,</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> ca&s;t at, and laid upon you by others; for all the fatigue, anx|iety and co&s;t, you have voluntarily undergone and expended; or let you be ever &s;o liberal for the fu|ture, in completing this edifice, or engaged in the &s;ervices thereof, and of religion in general, this will abundantly recompence you for all: This great advantage, reward, and recompence, you mu&s;t ever e&s;teem as <HI>&s;uch;</HI> never to flatter or deceive your&s;elves, as to imagine, upon the one hand, you have earned, and therefore may demand it as wages due to you; nor, upon the other, that you ever &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s it, notwith&s;tanding what you have hitherto done, unle&s;s now, and for the future of your lives, you live agree|able to the conditions thereof; the which is evident upon both &s;ides, from <HI>Heb.</HI> v. 9, &s;peaking of the &s;uf|ferings of CHRIST, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 4, the apo&s;tle &s;ubjoins, and being made perfect, he became the <HI>author</HI> of eternal <HI>&s;alvation,</HI> unto <HI>all</HI> them that <HI>obey him.</HI> Here &s;ee CHRIST, and not man, is the author and be&s;tower of this &s;alvation; yet you al&s;o &s;ee, although CHRIST is both author and giver, he will be&s;tow it upon none but &s;uch as will <HI>obey</HI> him; &s;o that we can have no ju&s;t expectation of this, the greate&s;t of all other advan|tages, unle&s;s we faithfully and truly <HI>obey</HI> him. My time only permits me to mention that <HI>obedience</HI> which we mu&s;t perform in this hou&s;e, in order to reap the advantages propo&s;ed, which is briefly thus:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI>&mdash;Be always careful to be here before the wor&s;hip begins; and when you enter this hou&s;e, re|member you enter the hou&s;e of GOD; therefore drop all ceremony to your fellow-men, all the care and
<PB N="14" REF="009948_0020_0F7B3AB76272D518">
concerns of your worldly bu&s;ine&s;s and employment; all improper thoughts and reflections, and have <HI>Ja|cob</HI>'s reflection upon your minds,&mdash;"How dreadful is this place! This is none other but the hou&s;e of GOD! This is the gate of heaven!" (<HI>Gen.</HI> xxviii. 17) let therefore a more &s;olemn awe and reverence be paid here. "Keep thy foot when thou goe&s;t to the hou&s;e of GOD, and be more ready to hear than to give the &s;acrifice of fools:&mdash;Be not ra&s;h with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be ha&s;ty to utter any thing before GOD," <HI>Eccles.</HI> v. 1, 2.</P>
<P><HI>Seccondly.</HI>&mdash;When the wor&s;hip begins, join devoutly and engagedly therein; let your hearts be &s;incerely animated, your affections di&s;creetly warmed, and your attention &s;tedfa&s;tly fixed; for it is a mo&s;t hei|nous and aggravated provocation, <Q>to draw near GOD, with our mouths, and with our lips to ho|nour him, but to have removed our hearts far from him.</Q> As we are compounded of &s;oul and body, and as both are redeemed, we &s;hould &s;erve and honour GOD with both; thus St. <HI>Paul</HI> infers, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 20, "for ye are bought with a price, <HI>therefore</HI> glorify GOD in your <HI>body,</HI> and in your &s;pirit which are GOD'S."&mdash;Neither &s;hould be neglected, in the wor&s;hip of GOD; but it is the &s;ervice and wor&s;hip of our &s;ouls, that mo&s;t excellent part of us, that is prin|cipally regarded; that of the body is in&s;ignificant and criminal, unle&s;s conducive to that of the &s;oul.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI>&mdash;When you pray for the pardon of your &s;ins, be re&s;olved to for&s;ake them; when for grace and GOD'S holy &s;pirit, be determined and engaged to receive, embrace, and comply therewith. When you return thanks, let a &s;en&s;e of GOD'S favors and ble&s;&s;ings be deeply imprinted in your &s;ouls, and with your voices; let your &s;ouls, and all that is
<PB N="15" REF="009948_0021_0F7B3AB810147098">
within, join in praying to and prai&s;ing GOD'S holy name.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI>&mdash;When the word of GOD is read or ex|pounded by the mini&s;ter, be all &s;ilence and attention to hear and learn GOD'S holy will, and your duty, taking up a firm re&s;olution to perform what&s;oever you under&s;tand to be his will and your duty.&mdash;The go&s;pel is, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s language, <Q>the power of GOD unto &s;alvation, unto every one that be|lieveth;</Q> (<HI>Rom.</HI> i. 16)&mdash;and in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, <Q>the incorruptible &s;eed by which we are born again,</Q> 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 23.&mdash;From whence you are therefore to learn what is GOD'S will, what he has and will do for your good and &s;alvation, and what you have to do to comply with, and come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI>&mdash;As the po&s;ture of our bodies, may, in the wor&s;hip of GOD, be &s;ub&s;ervient to the ends and pur|po&s;es of &s;piritual &s;ervices, &s;ome directions might be nece&s;&s;ary, had not tho&s;e wi&s;e and good men who compiled our &s;ervice book, already to your hands laid down all tho&s;e that are nece&s;&s;ary and proper; a little attention thereto, and u&s;e thereof, will lead your minds to di&s;cern the propriety and expediency of them, in the wor&s;hip of GOD in this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>La&s;tly&mdash;We ought to conclude the public &s;ervices of religion, by heartily joining in prayer for a ble&s;|&s;ing from GOD upon what we have heard, and what we have performed; for although <HI>Paul</HI> may plant, and <HI>Apollos</HI> water, 'tis GOD that gives the increa&s;e.&mdash;And &s;ince the mini&s;ter, who is the &s;ervant and em|ba&s;&s;ador of CHRIST, only has authority to pronounce the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, you &s;hould reverently wait, and with attention receive, joining with one heart and one voice, in that &s;ummary conclu&s;ion, AMEN, <HI>i. e.</HI> that it might be &s;o, that GOD would ble&s;s you in|deed.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009948_0022_0F7B3AB8C2E5A360">
If you, my brethren, would conduct your&s;elves after this manner, in the &s;ervice of GOD, and your redeemer JESUS CHRIST, in this hou&s;e of CHRIST'S, which you have with much labour and expence erected for the&s;e purpo&s;es, you will not ever find either your co&s;t or labour in building, nor your at|tention, care, and diligence in performing the&s;e, and the other duties of our holy religion, unrewarded; but that it will be found, from the great goodne&s;s of our heavenly father and creator, through the merits and interce&s;&s;ion of JESUS CHRIST our redeemer, infi|nitely rewarded&mdash;Unto whom, with the holy &s;pirit, let us now, and ever in this hou&s;e, as it is in heaven a&s;cribe all honor and prai&s;e. AMEN.</P>
