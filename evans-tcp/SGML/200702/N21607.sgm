<HEAD>THE CAVERN OF DEATH.</HEAD>
<P><Q>HOW awful is the approach of night amid the&s;e dreary &s;hades!</Q>
cried the brave Sir Albert, as he traver&s;ed the mo&s;t de&s;olate part of the Black Fore&s;t. The&s;e were the fir&s;t words that e&s;caped his lips, &s;ince, about mid-day, he had entered that wild de&s;art: and they were heard with &s;atisfaction by Maurice, his E&s;quire and only attendant, whom re&s;pect had for &s;ome time with difficulty re&s;trained from break|ing the &s;ilence, which, interrupted only at intervals by the &s;hrieks of the owl, or the flutter of the bat, &s;eemed to deepen the horrors of that gloomy &s;cene, and impre&s;&s;ed on his mind a &s;uper&s;titious dread, which had no vi&s;ible object, yet ro&s;e to the mo&s;t agonizing height.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028401_0005_0FD8F315AC6FBF68">"Ah, Sir!" cried he,
<Q>what courage le&s;s intrepid than yours, would at this hour of darkne&s;s thus ra&s;hly penetrate the rece&s;&s;es of this Fore&s;t?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have &s;een thee bold in battle, Mau|rice,</Q>
&s;aid Sir Albert:
<Q>what mighty danger do&s;t thou apprehend in this &s;oli|tude, which thou can&s;t deem it ra&s;hne&s;s in me to encounter?</Q></P>
<P>"Such &s;cenes as the&s;e," returned the E&s;quire,
<Q>bring every deed of horror to one's thought: in gloom like this, the Daemons of the Air, and Spirits of the Dead, have power.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My con&s;cience is clear from every deed,</Q>
&s;aid Sir Albert:
<Q>which &s;hould make me dread the vengeance of de|parted Spirits; and I tru&s;t that Heaven and good Angels will defend me from the malice of the Powers of Darkne&s;s. For any mortal foes I am armed, and fear not to encounter them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Would to heaven I had turned my back,</Q>
cried Maurice,
<Q>before I had reached this di&s;mal place!</Q></P>
<P>"And how could we have avoided it?" demanded the knight.
<Q>Thou ha&s;t thy|&s;elf
<PB N="7" REF="028401_0006_0FD8F318EC91C270">
been my guide towards the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I expected you would have reached it ere &s;un-&s;et, Sir,</Q>
returned the E&s;quire: "but you have rode &s;o &s;lowly"&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is true," &s;aid Sir Albert:
<Q>my mind has been too much occupied with the thoughts of her on who&s;e account, as to thee only I have confided, I have tra|velled hither, to leave me any lei&s;ure to recollect the tardy pace of my wearied hor&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>He was then beginning to relap&s;e into his former mu&s;ing; but Maurice, who, in the &s;ound of a human voice, had found &s;ome relief from the terrific phanta&s;ms which haunted his imagination, was eager to engage him in further di&s;cour&s;e; and though already acquainted with the &s;tory of his love, yet, &s;ince he knew the &s;ati&s;|faction with which on that &s;ubject his ma&s;ter would always enlarge, he would not mi&s;s the opportunity of introducing it.</P>
<P>"Did you not tell me, Sir," &s;aid he,
<Q>that it was three years &s;ince la&s;t you &s;aw the Lady Con&s;tance?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="028401_0007_0FD8F31E22340310">"It is more," replied Sir Albert.
<Q>My heart would per&s;uade me I had been &s;eparated from her during countle&s;s ages. &mdash;Ah! could I but know with what a&s;pect &s;he would review me!</Q></P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible, Sir," &s;aid Maurice,
<Q>that to merit and con&s;tancy like yours, &s;he can be in&s;en&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P>"While I was at a di&s;tance from her," &s;aid Sir Albert,
<Q>I was plea&s;ed at being thus flattered; my own heart flattered me. I knew indeed, that for me &s;he had never acknowledged any affection; but I knew that towards all others &s;he had &s;hewn the mo&s;t marked indifference; and even from the &s;olicitude with which &s;he would often &s;hun me, I could then draw a favourable inference, &s;ince, had &s;he not been con&s;cious that I adored her, &s;he could have had no cau&s;e to treat me with le&s;s courte&s;y than others; and love &s;o carefully concealed as mine, what but reciprocal love could have di&s;|covered? What other motive, have I vainly fancied, could have &s;o frequent|ly &s;uffu&s;ed her check with blu&s;hes, if I gazed on her, perhaps too eagerly?
<PB N="9" REF="028401_0008_0FD8F31F851646D0">
What el&s;e could have occa&s;ioned her emotion when we parted? Had I been indifferent to her, would &s;he not&mdash;after &s;o long an acquaintance with me, would &s;he not have bidden me adieu? But the unfini&s;hed &s;entence died upon her lips; and, though &s;he ha&s;ted from my pre|&s;ence, I had &s;een the tear that was &s;tart|ing from her eye.</Q>
&mdash;Sir Albert pau&s;ed, and was for &s;ome moments lo&s;t in the ten|der recollection; but pre&s;ently recovering him&s;elf&mdash; "Such," &s;aid he, <Q>have been the
ideas which have enabled me to live, while I have been exiled from her pre|&s;ence; but, now that I approach her dwelling, now that my heart once more beats with the expectation to review her, I dare no longer cheri&s;h the&s;e flattering illu&s;ions. If I have deceived my&s;elf, how cruel will be my di&s;appointment! And though my fonde&s;t hopes &s;hould have been ju&s;t, &s;hould &s;he have returned my tendere&s;t affection&punc; yet, after &s;o long a &s;eparation, dare I believe that I &s;till retain a place in her remembrance? May not &s;ome Lover, more worthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="028401_0009_0FD8F323A65E1520">
her, have long ere this effaced every trace of me from her heart?</Q></P>
<P>"I have often wondered, Sir," &s;aid Mau|rice,
<Q>how, with &s;o &s;trong an attachment to the Lady Con&s;tance, you could re|&s;olve to quit Prague, where &s;he re&s;ided, without declaring to her your &s;entiments and endeavouring to obtain the avowal of hers.</Q></P>
<P>"I have told thee, Maurice," returned
Sir Albert, <Q>that I had rather have died than have engaged her who&s;e happine&s;s I prized above my own, to &s;hare the for|tunes of a man who had &s;o little pro&s;|pect of being able to place her in a rank worthy of her merit.&mdash;I not now en|tertain any &s;uch pre&s;umptuous views: I wi&s;h but to &s;ee her: of what further I de&s;ire, my own heart is uncon&s;cious. Perhaps, &s;ince my Sword has purcha&s;ed me &s;ome portion of renown; &s;ince I have received the honour of Knighthood from the imperial Frederick Barbaro&s;&s;a, and have acquired &s;everal noble friends who have promi&s;ed me their &s;ervices&mdash;per|haps, at &s;ome future period, I may find my&s;elf in a &s;ituation&mdash;But I have already
<PB N="11" REF="028401_0010_0FD8F324D2032138">
&s;aid I will not indulge the&s;e thoughts. How far di&s;tant, Maurice, is the Ca&s;tle of Hertzwald, where &s;he now re&s;ides, from that of the Baron of Dornheim?</Q></P>
<P>"It is little more than a league," re|plied the E&s;quire.
<Q>I was frequently there while I dwelt at the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim. It was then occupied by her Uncle; at who&s;e death, a few months &s;ince, it de|volved to her Father.</Q></P>
<P>Another interval of &s;ilence now en&s;ued; but Maurice, again &s;olicitous to break it&mdash;
<Q>Did you never, Sir, acquaint Lord Fre|deric with your love?</Q>
&s;aid he.</P>
<P>"No, never," replied Sir Albert;
<Q>for though, from the time when it was my fortune to &s;ave his life in battle he al|ways profe&s;&s;ed for me the warme&s;t friend|&s;hip, yet his own in&s;en&s;ibility to the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, deterred me from placing in him the &s;ame confidence on that &s;ub|ject as I readily &s;hould on any other. It was by accident that he mentioned to me the arrival of the Father of Con|&s;tance to &s;ettle &s;o near the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim, whither he had before &s;o fre|quently invited me. Had he ever ex|perienced
<PB N="12" REF="028401_0011_0FD8F32B5EB8D670">
a pa&s;&s;ion like mine. I have often &s;ince reflected, that the eager emo|tion with which I then accepted his in|vitation might &s;ufficiently have di&s;co|vered to him the &s;ecret of my &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P>"From his childhood," &s;aid Maurice,
<Q>Lord Frederic was ever of a haughty and violent temper&mdash;a &s;tranger to ten|derne&s;s and pity; and, though I had re|ceived from him many favours and was yet more &s;ecure of the protection of the Baron his Father, I account my&s;elf for|tunate in my removal from&mdash; But whence this &s;udden &s;tream of light up|on our paths?</Q></P>
<P>"Is it not the moon emerging from be|hind a cloud?" &s;aid Sir Albert.</P>
<P>"The moon is already &s;et," returned the E&s;quire, trembling with renewed fears.</P>
<P>Sir Albert looked up&mdash;the thick inter|woven branches of the trees in that &s;pot ob&s;tructed his view; but, advancing a few paces to a more open place, he per|ceived a &s;mall black cloud, which &s;eemed to hang lower than the re&s;t, and hovered over his head with a tremulous motion, from the broken edges of which darted
<PB N="13" REF="028401_0012_0FD8F32E94812158">
forth fla&s;hes of light &s;ufficiently &s;trong to di&s;&s;ipate the darkne&s;s, which by this time completely over&s;pread the earth. Sir Albert gazed on it with wonder, and with that awe which any &s;upernatural appear|ance nece&s;&s;arily impre&s;&s;es on the mind. The terrified Maurice dropped the reins, and in &s;peechle&s;s agony expected &s;ome event of horror.&mdash;Pre&s;ently they heard in the air a loud &s;hriek, which &s;eemed utter|ed by no mortal voice; and at the &s;ame moment the clouds bur&s;t a&s;under; and while the darker parts faded away, and mix|ed with the &s;urrounding air, all the rays of light which had &s;treamed from it, &s;eemed to unite in one large ball of fire, and, de|&s;cending towards the earth with a rapid cour&s;e, &s;unk amid a thick clu&s;ter of trees, and &s;till continued to gleam behind their branches. Sir Albert in&s;tantly &s;purred forward his hor&s;e, and ha&s;tened towards the &s;pot. Maurice, with a trembling voice, urged him to forbear; but regardle&s;s of his fears the Knight advanced, and, for|cing a pa&s;&s;age through the trees, &s;aw that the Meteor &s;till appeared &s;u&s;pended over the entrance of a deep dark Cavern, which
<PB N="14" REF="028401_0013_0FD8F330D30C9258">
was illuminated by its &s;plendour: but ere he could come quite up, it &s;unk into the aby&s;s, and every object was enveloped in a thicker darkne&s;s than before.</P>
<P>Sir Albert, for &s;ome moments, he&s;itated how to act: his mighty courage, which always impelled him to attempt every pe|rilous adventure, &s;trongly urged him to enter the Cavern, and explore the my&s;tery which &s;ome inward and inexplicable pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion concurred with the appearance of the Meteor to per&s;uade him he &s;hould di&s;cover within its rece&s;&s;es; yet the dark|ne&s;s of the night, which &s;eemed to pre|clude the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a di&s;covery, and the probability that the Cavern might be the abode of &s;avage bea&s;ts or venomous &s;erpents, to who&s;e fury &s;hould he, in that di&s;mal place, expo&s;e him&s;elf, he might peri&s;h ingloriou&s;ly, the victim of an unju&s;|tifiable temerity, at la&s;t determined him to defer the attempt till the morrow, when he purpo&s;ed to return with lights; and for the pre&s;ent to pur&s;ue his journey to the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim, where he was already apprehen&s;ive he &s;hould arrive too late for admittance. On returning to Maurice,
<PB N="15" REF="028401_0014_0FD8F3358E8B7320">
he found him &s;o overcome with terror, that he &s;eemed &s;carcely to retain his &s;en&s;es: he talked wildly of a Spirit who pur&s;ued him, and of voices i&s;&s;uing from the Cavern. Sir Albert, though &s;eldom moved to anger by any trivial cau&s;e, was at la&s;t impatient of fears he deemed &s;o groundle&s;s, and reproved his folly with a har&s;hne&s;s which &s;eemed in &s;ome degree to recall him to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>They had not proceeded far, before they di&s;covered a light through the trees; Mau|rice &s;tarted, and would have turned back; for the Meteor &s;till haunted his imagina|tion, and left him no recollection of the vicinity of the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim, whence Sir Albert concluded the light to proceed, and he &s;oon found that his conjecture was ju&s;t. On approaching nearer, he perceived that the whole front of the Ca&s;tle was il|luminated; and, amid many voices which he heard within its walls, he could di&s;|tingui&s;h the &s;trains of mirthful mu&s;ic. Though the &s;oul of Sir Albert was little di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hare in this apparent fe&s;tivity, he was plea&s;ed to find that the drawbridge was not yet rai&s;ed, nor the porter retired to re&s;t; which had he found to be the ca&s;e,
<PB N="16" REF="028401_0015_0FD8F336CE88DEF8">
it had been his intention rather to take up his lodging for that night in the Fore&s;t, than to di&s;turb the family at an un&s;ea&s;on|able hour. On &s;ounding a horn which was &s;u&s;pended by the gate, it was in&s;tantly un|barred, and a Sene&s;chal came forth, and invited him to enter, telling him, that on that day admittance was free to all. Sir Albert could not but demand what pro&s;|perous event was the occa&s;ion of the re|joicing which he perceived in the Ca&s;tle. The Sene&s;chal replied, that it was to cele|brate the approaching nuptials of the Baron with a Lady whom he had for &s;ome time courted, and which, it had been that morn|ing &s;ettled, &s;hould take place in three days time. The Knight then demanded to &s;peak with Lord Frederic; he was con|ducted into a &s;pacious apartment, where he had not waited long before Lord Frederic came.</P>
<P>Sir Albert, having rai&s;ed the vizor of his ca&s;que, advanced to acco&s;t him; but he no &s;ooner recognized the Knight, than, not al|lowing him time to &s;peak, he embraced him with an eagerne&s;s &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of his joy. "Is it po&s;&s;ible, my friend!"
<PB N="17" REF="028401_0016_0FD8F3392E9078A0">
cried he, <Q>that I behold thee here? Thy
arrival at this juncture was the object of my mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes; it was an hap|pine&s;s to which my hope dur&s;t &s;carce a&s;pire.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I con&s;ider &s;o kind a welcome, my Lord!</Q>
replied Sir Albert,
<Q>as an ad|ditional proof of your friend&s;hip towards me; and it enhances the plea&s;ure this meeting has afforded me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A&s;cribe not my joy to friend&s;hip on|ly,</Q>
replied Lord Frederic:
<Q>my own intere&s;t has too principal a &s;hare in it.&mdash; To &s;ee thee at any time I &s;hould re|joice; but now, when to valour like thine I may owe the felicity of my life, thy fortunate arrival has recalled me from de&s;peration.</Q></P>
<P>"What mean you, my Lord?" &s;aid the Knight;
<Q>what cau&s;e can have reduced you to de&s;pair? and in what manner can I be &s;o happy as to &s;erve you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not now a &s;ea&s;on to explain my&s;elf more fully,</Q>
&s;aid Lord Frederic:
<Q>among the crowds who now enter promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly every apartment in the Ca&s;tle, I know not who may over-hear me. To|morrow
<PB N="18" REF="028401_0017_0FD8F33931F663D8">
morning we will walk toge|ther in the Fore&s;t. Meanwhile I will lead thee to the fea&s;t: after thy journey hither, refre&s;hment may be welcome to thee; but, amid the &s;ports and folly of my Father's &s;ervile train, let the re|collection of our mutual amity po&s;&s;e&s;s thy mind; and let me find thee to-mor|row, as thou ha&s;t ever hitherto appeared to me, a friend on whom I may rely.</Q></P>
<P>The words of Lord Frederic, and &s;till more the agitation of his manner, &s;ur|prized and alarmed Sir Albert: he renew|ed his a&s;&s;urances of his readine&s;s to &s;erve him, and they walked together to the Great Hall of the Ca&s;tle. Lord Frederic there pre&s;ented his newly arrived friend to his father, who was encircled by a crowd of the gue&s;ts who were come to partake of his fe&s;tival. The Baron on hearing his name announced, turned ha&s;ti|ly round; but, in&s;tead of bidding him welcome, he for &s;ome moments regarded him and continued &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Sir Albert, who had expected a different reception, was in &s;ome degree confu|&s;ed at this; and Lord Frederic, vi&s;ibly
<PB N="19" REF="028401_0018_0FD8F33D0611C988">
offended at his father's coldne&s;s towards
friend to whom he owed &s;o much&mdash; "I thought, my Lord,"
&s;aid he,
<Q>I had already informed you, that it was this valiant Cavalier who expo&s;ed his own life to the mo&s;t imminent danger, to re&s;cue me from the enemies again&s;t whom, wearied, and fainting with lo&s;s of blood, I was no longer able to defend my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And I will eagerly embrace every op|portunity, my Son!</Q>
returned the Ba|ron, &s;tarting as if from a deep mu&s;ing,
<Q>to prove to him and to the world, how dearly I prize that life which he then pre&s;erved.&mdash;Mo&s;t valiant Sir!</Q>
conti|nued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Sir Albert,
<Q>I mu&s;t entreat your forgivene&s;s, if, at the moment of your approach, my thoughts were &s;o far engro&s;&s;ed by other matters, that I did not, immediately on the mention of your name, recollect the va&s;t obligation I was under to you. It is with unfeigned joy that I embrace the deliverer of my Son, and per&s;onally expre&s;s to him the gratitude and e&s;teem which I long have borne him. You
<PB N="20" REF="028401_0019_0FD8F34150C2EC90">
are mo&s;t welcome to my Ca&s;tle; and I flatter my&s;elf that you will &s;hew, by the length of your abode in it, your per&s;ua|&s;ion of the &s;atisfaction your pre&s;ence affords me.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Albert made a &s;uitable reply to this compliment; and, after a few more ex|pre&s;&s;ions of courte&s;y, the Baron entreated him to di&s;arm. The Knight at fir&s;t re|fu&s;ed; but on being further pre&s;&s;ed, he complied; and retiring to a private cham|ber, he was attended by his own E&s;quire, and by one of the dome&s;tics of the Ca&s;tle, who, by the Baron's command, brought him a rich robe to put on, after he &s;hould have quitted his arms.</P>
<P>As Maurice was unbuckling his cor&s;let. Sir Albert perceived that his hand trem|bled &mdash;"Thou ha&s;t not yet," &s;aid he,
<Q>re|covered from the terror which &s;eized thee in the Fore&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>The E&s;quire acknowledged he had not.</P>
<P><Q>Did you meet with any alarming ad|venture there, Sir?</Q>
&s;aid the Baron's dome&s;tic.</P>
<P><Q>We pa&s;&s;ed near the mouth of a Ca|vern,</Q>
returned Sir Albert:
<Q>what
<PB N="21" REF="028401_0020_0FD8F34152BAE430">
terrific vi&s;ions Maurice might behold there, him&s;elf can be&s;t inform you.</Q></P>
<P>"The mouth of a cavern?" exclaimed the dome&s;tic; "and near this Ca&s;tle?"</P>
<P>"Scarce a furlong di&s;tant," replied the Knight.</P>
<P><Q>And did you then &s;ee nothing there, Sir?</Q>
rejoined, the other.</P>
<P><Q>What &s;hould you &s;uppo&s;e me to have &s;een?</Q>
demanded Sir Albert, with &s;ome emotion.</P>
<P><Q>So many &s;ights of terror have been &s;een in that &s;pot,</Q>
returned the do|me&s;tic, <Q>that it is long &s;ince any of us have dared to approach it. That Ca|vern is a&s;&s;uredly the habitation of the Infernal Spirits. Sometimes there have been heard in it hollow groans, or &s;hrieks of angui&s;h; &s;ometimes, noi&s;es re|&s;embling the ru&s;hing of torrents, or the rumbling of pent-up vapours. There is a report, that &s;ome murder was for|merly perpetrated there, and that it is the avenging Spirit of the Dead who &s;till haunts the place where he was di&s;|united from his body.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="028401_0021_0FD8F342D1862520">
<Q>Were the&s;e opinions current, Mau|rice,</Q>
&s;aid Sir Albert,
<Q>during the time of thy abode at this Ca&s;tle?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have heard &s;ome mention of them, Sir,</Q>
returned the E&s;quire, paler than before.</P>
<P><Q>And how long is it &s;ince the&s;e &s;trange noi&s;es and appearances were fir&s;t noticed in the Cavern? &s;aid the Knight.</Q></P>
<P>"I have been told, Sir," returned the Baron's dome&s;tic,
<Q>that the fir&s;t porten|tous circum&s;tance ob&s;erved there, was a light which &s;hone round the mouth of it, &s;ome four or five and twenty years ago, nearly about the time when the Ca&s;tle came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Lord. But I can aver nothing on the &s;ubject with any certainty, as it is &s;carcely three months &s;ince I came hither my&s;elf; and all the events of that di&s;tant period have been variou&s;ly related to me by different per&s;ons belonging to the Ca&s;tle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thou, Maurice, came&s;t hither with the pre&s;ent Baron,</Q>
&s;aid Sir Albert&mdash;
<Q>Do&s;t not thou remember any further particulars? Did no tradition point
<PB N="23" REF="028401_0022_0FD8F3471BBB0B78">
out who this murdered per&s;on was &s;up|po&s;ed to have been?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Some Traveller, wandering in the Fore&s;t, Sir,</Q>
replied Maurice;
<Q>but in|deed the murder was only a vague re|port; and the Cavern had been dreaded equally by the neighbouring people, from a period far earlier than that of the acce&s;&s;ion of the Baron.</Q></P>
<P>"Has this Cave any particular name?" demanded the Knight.</P>
<P>"It is called the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Die Hole des Todes,</HI> is the name which it &s;till re|tains; and the neighbouring Pea&s;antry at this day dread to approach it, and entertain many wild and &s;uper&s;titious ideas re&s;pecting it.</NOTE> <HI>Cavern of Death?</HI>" returned the dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>Sir Albert made an end of attiring him|&s;elf in &s;ilence; for this account of a place where he had him&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed a circum|&s;tance which he believed to be &s;upernatu|ral, had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his mind. &mdash;His de&s;ire to penetrate the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the Cavern was now &s;tronger than ever: he judged it, however, expe|ent to forbear mentioning the de&s;ign he had conceived, &s;ince he knew not who
<PB N="24" REF="028401_0023_0FD8F34BC4DA3FA0">
might have an intere&s;t in preventing the dire di&s;coveries to which he was inward|ly per&s;uaded it would lead.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was ready, he returned to the Great Hall, where the Baron and his Son received him with new demon&s;trati|ons of joy. A magnificent banquet was now &s;pread. The Baron placed Sir Albert in the mo&s;t honourable &s;eat, neare&s;t him|&s;elf, and treated him as a gue&s;t of the high|e&s;t di&s;tinction. Sir Albert, however, could not but ob&s;erve, that from time to time he fixed his eyes on him with a remarka|ble intentne&s;s, but they were in&s;tantly a|verted if his encountered them. For Lord Frederic, his &s;tern and frowning brow &s;uf|ficiently expre&s;&s;ed the di&s;turbance of his mind; he joined in no di&s;cour&s;e with any of the gue&s;ts; and if ever a momentary &s;mile di&s;pelled the gloom of his counte|nance, it was when he looked towards his newly arrived friend. As Sir Albert extend|ed his hand acro&s;s the table the lu&s;tre of a ring he wore on his finger caught the Ba|ron's eye. He prai&s;ed its richne&s;s, and re|que&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to view it more clo&s;ely. Sir Albert immediately took it off, and
<PB N="25" REF="028401_0024_0FD8F35082FD32A0">
pre&s;ented it to him. It was a large ruby, encircled with brilliants. The Baron ex|amined it with great attention, and declar|ed the ruby to be the mo&s;t valuable he had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>"I am my&s;elf, Sir Knight," added he,
<Q>well &s;killed in jewels; and you have &s;hewn your&s;elf to be equally &s;o, by the purcha&s;e of &s;o fine a &s;tone.</Q></P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you my Lord," returned Sir Albert,
<Q>I am totally unqualified to judge of its value: it bears, indeed, an high one to me&mdash;not on account of its own richne&s;s, but becau&s;e it is the only relic I retain of my decea&s;ed Father.</Q></P>
<P>The Baron again prai&s;ed the beauty of the ring, and returned it to its owner.</P>
<P>The banquet was not ended till a very late hour. At la&s;t, when it was almo&s;t morning, the gue&s;ts departed, well &s;atis|fied with the ho&s;pitality they had expe|rienced; and the Baron him&s;elf conduct|ed Sir Albert to the chamber he had cau&s;ed to be prepared for him, where, af|ter many expre&s;&s;ions of courte&s;y, he left him. In his way thence he met Maurice, who was going to attend upon his ma&s;ter.
<PB N="26" REF="028401_0025_0FD8F3520E4C6E50">
He immediately knew him, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at his return to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"I was &s;orry," added he,
<Q>that you &s;hould receive any cau&s;e for di&s;plea&s;ure in the &s;ervice of my Son: but though you cho&s;e to quit him, you may remain a&s;&s;ured of my friend&s;hip and protection.</Q></P>
<P>The E&s;quire thanked him for this a&s;|&s;urance; and the Baron, telling him he would gladly &s;peak further with him, de|&s;ired him to repair to his apartment in the morning, as early as he &s;hould ri&s;e.</P>
<P>Maurice then attended his ma&s;ter, who &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, and retired to re&s;t; but it was long before &s;leep clo&s;ed his eyes. Lord Frederic's my&s;terious expre&s;&s;ions and vi&s;ible melancholy, rendered him anxious for further di&s;cour&s;e with him; but he was yet more impatient to enter the Cavern, of which &s;uch &s;trange accounts had been given him. He lo&s;t him&s;elf in vain conjectures re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of the noi&s;es and extraordinary appearances reported to proceed from it, and was per|&s;uaded that &s;ome deed of horror had been perpetrated there; though, had it not been for what he had him&s;elf ob&s;erved, he might
<PB N="27" REF="028401_0026_0FD8F3568EAF4700">
probably have treated the whole as the vi&s;ion of the idle &s;uper&s;tition of the pea|&s;ants. At la&s;t his thoughts, &s;eldom &s;o long diverted from the object of his dear|e&s;t affections, returned into their u&s;ual channel: the idea of his vicinity to the dwelling of the Lady Con&s;tance po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it&s;elf of his &s;oul, and left him no recol|lection of any thing be&s;ide. His imagi|nation &s;eemed already to have exhau&s;ted every po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tance which might attend their meeting; yet he continued retracing each fond idea, till, overcome by wearine&s;s and watching, he at la&s;t fell into a &s;lumber.</P>
<P>His dreams did not corre&s;pond with this late&s;t &s;ubject of his meditations: they were di&s;mal, my&s;terious and terrific.&mdash;He imagined him&s;elf again &s;eated at the Ba|ron's fe&s;tive board; the &s;trains of mu&s;ic again &s;ounded in his ears; mirth &s;parkled in the eyes of every gue&s;t, and the light of innumerable tourches diffu&s;ed an artifi|cial day: when &s;uddenly their brightne&s;s was eclip&s;ed by the interpo&s;ition of a dark &s;hadow, which &s;kimmed along the table, and &s;ometimes &s;eemed to re&s;t hovering
<PB N="28" REF="028401_0027_0FD8F35948FAF340">
over the centre of it. Sir Albert and all the gue&s;ts looked up, and beheld a mo&s;t hideous Spectre, of a gigantic &s;ize, tra|ver&s;ing the air above their heads with a &s;low and melancholy flight; his &s;tern and threatening a&s;pect appalled every heart. As they regarded him, an hollow voice proclaimed,</P>
<L>&mdash;"The fated hour is come!</L>
<L>"And the fell powers of vengeance are abroad!"</L>
<P>The Ca&s;tle &s;hook from its foundations: tht Spectre waved his wings, and imme|diately a thick mi&s;t aro&s;e, which in a few moments enveloped all who were pre&s;ent. Sir Albert could no longer di&s;tingui&s;h any object; but, amid the general darkne&s;s, his ears were thrice a&s;&s;ailed with &s;krieks of horror. On a &s;udden, a vivid ray of light &s;treamed from the Ea&s;t upon the &s;pot on which he &s;tood; he turned his eyes, and beheld a cloud re&s;embling that which the preceding evening had directed his &s;teps to the <HI>Cavern of Death</HI>; and by degrees he di&s;cerned, &s;eated in the mid&s;t, a warri|or, clad in refulgent arms, and bearing on his brea&s;t the en&s;ign of the cro&s;s. The ra|diance
<PB N="29" REF="028401_0028_0FD8F35E675778E0">
which &s;urrounded him di&s;per&s;ed the mi&s;t and Sir Albert found, that of all the company who had been a&s;&s;embled at the fea&s;t, him&s;elf alone remained. The horrible Spectre had al&s;o di&s;appeared at the approach of this le&s;s terrific phantom, who, de&s;cending from the cloud, and re|garding Sir Albert with a look of cele&s;tial benignity, extended his arms to embrace him. Sir Albert with an emotion which he had never before experienced, ha&s;tened towards him; but no &s;ooner did the Phantom meet his touch, than its &s;ub|&s;tance &s;eemed to fade away; its &s;hining arms dropped off, and the Knight perceiv|ed that he had folded a &s;keleton to his brea&s;t.&mdash;He &s;tarted, and unclo&s;ed his arms with horror! yet it fell not to the ground; but, waving in the air a bloody &s;word, which at fir&s;t it had not weilded, it di&s;|tinctly uttered, in a thin faint voice the&s;e words:</P>
<L>"From this cold hand thou mu&s;t receive this &s;word,</L>
<L>"Ere I can be aveng'd, or thou re&s;tor'd!"</L>
<P>And immediately vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>The horror it had in&s;pired awoke Sir Albert. A dewy chill had invaded his
<PB N="30" REF="028401_0029_0FD8F35F483DE0E8">
limbs;&mdash;for &s;ome moments he &s;carce dur&s;t rai&s;e his eyes, left they &s;hould meet &s;ome &s;hape of terror; and the fear which now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his &s;oul, was perhaps the more painful to him, becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t time he had ever experienced its power. By degrees, he became &s;en&s;ible that it had no other object than a dream; but though he then &s;oon &s;hook it off, yet &s;till the im|pre&s;&s;ion continued which that dream had made on his mind; and he was per&s;uaded that it was &s;ome vi&s;ion of my&s;terious im|port, and not any common creation of fancy, which had thus deeply moved him.&mdash;The morning was now far advanced. Sir Albert ro&s;e, &s;eated him&s;elf by the window, and mu&s;ed. The words of the apparition, who had &s;o &s;uddenly a&s;&s;umed a form &s;o gha&s;tly, &s;till re&s;ounded in his ears; and he felt a &s;trong conviction that &s;ome event of futu|rity would unfold to him their oracular meaning. He was unable to gue&s;s who the per&s;on &s;hould be who&s;e &s;pirit thus &s;eemed to call for vengeance; yet he was &s;ome|times inclined to &s;uppo&s;e it might be the &s;ame whom popular report averred to have been murdered in the <HI>Cavern of Death.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="028401_0030_0FD8F360EAB9B6B0">His thoughts were &s;till wholly occupied by conjectures on this &s;ubject, when a me&s;|&s;age was brought to him from the Baron, inviting him to breakfa&s;t with him in his apartment.

The compliments he paid to his character, and former heroic actions, were indeed &s;uch as gave pain rather than plea&s;ure to Sir Albert, who&s;e mode&s;ty was &s;uch as rendered all prai&s;es of him&s;elf ex|tremely irk&s;ome to him.

<P><Q>I was born in the city of Prague, my Lord,</Q>
returned the Knight.</P>
<P>"Was your Father, then a Bohemian?" demanded the Baron.</P>
<P>"It may &s;eem &s;trange, my Lord," re|plied Sir Albert,
<Q>to &s;ay, that I know not with any certainty what was my Father's country: my Mother, I&s;abella Von

Glatzdorff, was of one of the mo&s;t an|cient families in Bohemia; but I lo&s;t both my parents too early to retain any recollection of them. I am only acquaint|ed with their misfortunes, and my own &s;hare in them, from the report of an Uncle, to whom I owed my education.</Q></P>
<P>"Your words excite my curio&s;ity," &s;aid the Baron:
<Q>may I enquire what tho&s;e misfortunes were, in which you were &s;o early involved?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I can relate the &s;tory but imperfect|ly, My Lord,</Q>
returned the Knight.
<Q>My Uncle, in his youth, a&s;&s;umed the cro&s;s, and engaged in the &s;ervice of Bald|win the Second of Jeru&s;alem, at that time much &s;traitened by his enemies; and in the battle in which that Prince was unfortunately taken pri&s;oner by the Turki&s;h Emir Balac, he was generally reported to have been &s;lain; but fate had re&s;erved him for &s;everer &s;ufferings: he al&s;o had fallen alive into the power of the Infidels, among whom he remain|ed in a rigorous captivity during eleven years. At la&s;t he contrived means to e&s;|cape; but on his return to Prague, when
<PB N="33" REF="028401_0032_0FD8F36817CC7FB0">
he expected to have been received with joy by his family, he experienced the mo&s;t cruel di&s;appointment. His parents, and his elder Brother, were dead: the latter, believing him no more, had be|queathed all his e&s;tates to a di&s;tant rela|tion, omitting to make any re&s;ervation in his favour, in the event of his return. His &s;i&s;ter alone &s;urvived; but it was many days before he could di&s;cover the mi&s;erable place of her abode; and, when his &s;earch was at la&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, what were the feelings of his generous heart, when he found her bereft of rea&s;on, and &s;upported by the charity of &s;trangers? From them he learned, that after the death of her parents, &s;he had di&s;obliged the Brother on whom &s;he was left de|pendent, by her marriage with Rodolph Von Fahrenbach, a young &s;tranger, of whom they could give no further account than that he had di&s;tingui&s;hed his valour in a conte&s;t with a Bohemian Noble|man, who al&s;o courted her favour; and that &s;hortly after their marriage, he had quitted her, to engage in a cru&s;ade, in compliance with a vow he had made pre|vious
<PB N="34" REF="028401_0033_0FD8F369106D5A50">
to his acquaintance with her: that he had been ab&s;ent two years: at the end of which time certain intelligence of his death was brought to her, the &s;hock proved greater than &s;he was able to &s;up|port; it threw her into a delirious fever, from which, for many days, the utmo&s;t danger was apprehended; her life was however pre&s;erved, but her &s;en&s;es never returned to her. She had been for &s;ome months in this deplorable &s;ituation, when &s;he was vi&s;ited by her brother, who immediately took her and me (who had not been born till after my Father's de|parture) to his own hou&s;e, when he em|ployed every means for her recovery which the advice of the able&s;t phy&s;icians could &s;ugge&s;t; but his cares were un|availing; the deep melancholy which continually preyed upon her mind, &s;oon threw her into a decline; and within a year after his return, &s;he died, the un|happy victim of de&s;pair. From that time, all the affection which my Uncle had borne her, &s;eemed transferred to me. He made many inquiries after my Fa|ther's family, wi&s;hing to obtain their
<PB N="35" REF="028401_0034_0FD8F36D8A60B148">
protection for me; but he could not di&s;cover in what part of Germany they were &s;ettled. My mother, in a moment of phrenzy, had de&s;troyed all the letters &s;he had received from my father, and indeed every memorial of him, except this ring, which you, my Lord, la&s;t night ob&s;erved: it had been his fir&s;t gift to her; and, till the late&s;t moment of her life, &s;he would never &s;uffer it to be taken from her finger. But, if my uncle failed in di&s;covering my other re|lations, he never permitted me to feel their lo&s;s. His income was &s;mall; but he abridged his own expences, that he might be enabled to defray tho&s;e of my education; and, as &s;oon as I was at an age to bear arms, he led me him&s;elf into the paths of glory. Unacquaint|ed with my real father, I always venera|ted this generous kin&s;man as &s;uch: he has now been dead &s;ome years; but I &s;hall ever re&s;pect and love his memory, and the &s;en&s;e of the gratitude I owe him will remain with me to the la&s;t hour of my exi&s;tence.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="028401_0035_0FD8F370A33F77D0">The Baron heard this narrative with much attention; and the various changes of his countenance expre&s;&s;ed how deeply he intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the misfortunes of the unhappy I&s;abella.

They continued in di&s;cour&s;e for &s;ome time longer; when the Knight, recollecting the de&s;ire Lord Fre|deric had expre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee him, thought it time to go in que&s;t of him: he ro&s;e, and bade the baron adieu for the pre&s;ent; and with mutual courte&s;y they parted.</P>
<P>In a long gallery which he pa&s;&s;ed through in his way from the Baron's apartment, he found Lord Frederic, walking to and fro with ha&s;ty &s;teps.</P>
<P><Q>What intere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;es can have detained you &s;o long with my Father?</Q>
&s;aid that impetuous youth:
<Q>I have been here almo&s;t an hour, waiting till you &s;hould quit him.</Q></P>
<P>"I &s;taid the longer with him," replied Sir Albert,
<Q>becau&s;e I expected you would meet me in his apartment: as you came not thither, I concluded you were other|wi&s;e engaged. I was now about to &s;eek

&mdash;And, as he &s;poke, he took the arm of Sir Albert, and led him out of the gallery.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed onwards to the ca&s;tle gate: Lord Frederic threw it open, and went forth into the Fore&s;t.&mdash;Sir Albert &s;till ac|companied him; and neither broke &s;ilence till they reached a deep glade, entirely ex|cluded from all view of the Ca&s;tle. Here they &s;topped&mdash;Lord Frederic quitted Sir Albert's arm, and regarding him earne&s;tly, "I would know," &s;aid he,
<Q>whether I might indeed acco&s;t thee by the title of my friend?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Can you think &s;o meanly of me, my Lord,</Q>
returned the Knight,
<Q>as to &s;up|po&s;e I &s;hould ever afford him for whom I had profe&s;&s;ed a regard, any cau&s;e to que&s;tion its &s;incerity? I &s;hall certainly

never be unmindful of the many cour|te&s;ies I have received from you; and I tru&s;t I may appeal to more than words, to prove the reality of the friend&s;hip I have borne you.</Q></P>
<P>"It is true, dear Albert!" cried Lord Frederic;
<Q>I have not forgotten that to thy friend&s;hip I have owed my life, while mine towards thee has hitherto had no opportunities of &s;hewing it&s;elf but in words and vain profe&s;&s;ions: hereafter, I tru&s;t, I may be able to give thee more &s;olid proofs of gratitude. But fir&s;t, I mu&s;t again have recour&s;e to the valour to which I am already &s;o much indebted, for a &s;ervice, which, if it refu&s;e to render me, it were better it had never been ex|erted in my cau&s;e &mdash;Life is only a ble&s;s|ing to the happy!</Q></P>
<P><Q>And what unexpected calamity, my Lord,</Q>
&s;aid Sir Albert,
<Q>can have ren|dered you otherwi&s;e? Your perturbed looks, and many expre&s;&s;ion which have fallen from you, lead me to apprehend &s;ome dreadful evil.</Q></P>

cried the Knight;&mdash;
<Q>but who is your fair Mi&s;tre&s;s? and how can I pre&s;erve her to you?</Q></P>
<P>"Before I di&s;clo&s;e further, Sir Albert," &s;aid the youth,

<P>Lord Frederic pre&s;&s;ed him further; but Sir Albert liked it not. His intimacy with that young Nobleman had ari&s;en, not from any &s;imilarity of &s;entiment or of temper, but &s;olely from their having been compa|nions in war; and it had a&s;&s;umed the name of friend&s;hip, &s;ince Lord Frederic, pre|&s;erved by Sir Albert from the mo&s;t immi|nent danger, and therefore con&s;idering him as the brave&s;t of men, had eagerly courted his &s;ociety, and had, on every occa&s;ion, profe&s;&s;ed for him the highe&s;t regard. But
<PB N="40" REF="028401_0039_0FD8F37E71585300">
though his unremitted courte&s;ies had gain|ed him a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the affection of Sir Albert, they had not &s;o far blinded his judgment, as to induce him to concur implicitly, and without further informa|tion, in the projects of a youth, who&s;e im|petuous pa&s;&s;ions, but for his own more prudent coun&s;els, would, he knew on ma|ny former occa&s;ions, have involved him in the greate&s;t indi&s;cretions.

per&s;on, left, hearing of it from others, I might be induced to &s;uppo&s;e my own intere&s;ts endangered, and to attempt &s;ome oppo&s;ition to his de&s;igns. I was the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at this intelligence, be|cau&s;e I knew, that, &s;ince the death of his other Sons, it had been a con&s;tant &s;ubject of unea&s;ine&s;s to him to behold in me the la&s;t of his race: I have heard that he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be alarmed by &s;ome prophecy or dream, I know not particularly what, which had denounced &s;ome dreadful fate to his family, when|ever one male &s;hould be the only &s;urvi|vor of it. He never clearly explained him&s;elf to me on this point; but he had often pre&s;&s;ed my marriage with a degree of earne&s;tne&s;s which was very irk&s;ome to me, and had always appeared di&s;plea&s;ed at the invincible reluctance I had di&s;|covered. When, therefore, he acquaint|ed me with his wi&s;h to pre&s;ent me to the Lady to whom he expected me to pay the duties of a &s;on, I attended him to her abode, not without &s;ome &s;atisfaction that he had rather cho&s;en to offer her his own hand, than to attempt to compel me

to give her mine. But how can I ex|pre&s;s to you, Sir Albert! the &s;udden change which, the &s;ight of this peerle&s;s beauty effected in my heart? That heart hitherto &s;o in&s;en&s;ible, in a moment con|fe&s;&s;ed the power of her irre&s;i&s;tible charms. I had been too little intere&s;ted in her to make any previous inquiries re&s;pecting her; I had not been even told &s;he was fair:&mdash;judge, therefore&mdash;if ever your temper, &s;ofter than my own, has felt the influence of beauty&mdash;judge what were my emotions, when in her to whom I was introduced as to my fu|ture Step-mother, I beheld the mo&s;t lovely creature that the world certainly ever &s;aw! With the idea of my Fa|ther's wife, I had connected that of proportionable age; but her's appeared not to exceed my own. Her form&mdash; her eyes&mdash;I cannot de&s;cribe them, Sir Albert!&mdash;If my hopes in you deceive me not, I tru&s;t you will ere long behold her; and believe me, I do not mean to under-rake your &s;ervices, when I tell you that the &s;ight of &s;uch charms were laone a recompen&s;e worthy of them.

The only embelli&s;hment of which her beauty was capable, it received when I was pre&s;ented to her; &s;he was de&s;ired to con&s;ider me as the Son of him to whom her hand was de&s;tined; &s;he &s;ighed as &s;he regarded me; and her cheek, before al|mo&s;t colourle&s;s, was &s;uffu&s;ed with a blu&s;h, as &s;he permitted me to take her hand, which, with an eagerne&s;s which bani&s;h|ed from my remembrance every idea of the character in which the &s;alute was permitted me; I pre&s;&s;ed to my enraptu|red lips. She &s;ighed more deeply than be|fore, and drew her hand &s;uddenly from me; her eyes filled with tears, and &s;he turned away.&mdash;I do not &s;urely flatter my&s;elf, Sir Albert, when I impute the&s;e marks of &s;orrow to the impul&s;e of &s;en|timents with which my appearance had in&s;pired her: &s;he regretted that it was to my Father, and not to my&s;elf, that &s;he was promi&s;ed, and it was her appre|hen&s;ion left this emotion &s;hould be re|marked by tho&s;e in who&s;e eyes it would be deemed a crime, which made her &s;o ha&s;tily quit a &s;ituation in which, if I may judge from my own feelings, &s;he would have found it &s;o difficult to di&s;&s;emble

It was probably fortunate for me that her di&s;cretion, or perhaps her timidity exceeded mine: I &s;hould que&s;|tionle&s;s have otherwi&s;e betrayed to her Father and my own the new-born pa&s;|&s;ion, which, as &s;oon as I had recover|ed from that kind of trance into which the fir&s;t view of her charms had thrown me, every motive &s;o &s;trongly urged me to conceal.

Frederic; <Q>I know your high &s;en&s;e of honour; and tru&s;t me, I would employ your valour in no enterprize unworthy of it. Could the Baron be &s;urprized at any di&s;advantage, I &s;hould never have had recour&s;e to your arm; among my own followers, I could have found tho&s;e who would faithfully have executed my purpo&s;e.

<P>"Call me no longer &s;uch?" cried Sir Albert;
<Q>I di&s;claim the friend&s;hip of a parricide!</Q></P>
<P>Lord Frederic was provoked at the re|proach; but, having already &s;o far put him&s;elf in Sir Albert's power, he dur&s;t not expre&s;s his indignation, but rather fought, by new entreaties, to bend him to his purpo&s;e.

<P>"Con&s;tance!" exclaimed Sir Albert, &s;tarting wildly: "Is it Con&s;tance?"</P>
<P><Q>Con&s;tance of Hertzwald, is the Lady de&s;tined to my Father's arms,</Q>

<Q>if thou refu&s;e, in pity to her and to thy friend, to re&s;cue her

youthful charms from &s;uch a &s;acrifice, and to give her to a lover more worthy to enjoy them!</Q></P>
<P><Q>And does the Lady Con&s;tance return thy love?</Q>
&s;aid Sir Albert, trembling, and &s;carcely able to pronounce the que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>"I cannot doubt it," replied Lord Fre|deric:
<Q>I have never indeed received from her lips the tran&s;porting a&s;&s;ur|ance, &s;ince I have never been able to obtain an interview with her but in my Father's pre&s;ence; but one of her wo|men, who is my only confident, a&s;&s;ures me that &s;he is very aver&s;e to the mar|riage propo&s;ed, and that many circum|&s;tances have rendered it very evident that &s;he &s;ecretly loves another. That I was the man &s;o ble&s;t, I dur&s;t not po&s;i|tively a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf till the la&s;t time I vi&s;ited her Father's Ca&s;tle; but then, her looks, her whole demeanour, were &s;uch as it were impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;interpret. She &s;eemed unable to avert her eyes from my per&s;on; yet if I, or any other, appeared to notice the earne&s;tne&s;s with which &s;he regarded me, &s;he was covered
<PB N="51" REF="028401_0050_0FD8F39B0067F160">
with confu&s;ion; and many times a &s;igh e&s;caped her, which &s;till more &s;trongly &s;poke the tender &s;entiments which oc|cupied her &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P>While Lord Frederic was thus &s;peaking, the countenance of Sir Albert was flu&s;hed with a thou&s;and conflicting pa&s;&s;ions. Twice he laid his hand upon his &s;word; and twice, even amid the tran&s;ports of jealous fury, he recollected that he was the gue&s;t of him on whom he would have drawn it; that he was him&s;elf armed, and that his rival was not&mdash;he recollected, and he was ma&s;ter of the emotion.</P>
<P>"We may meet again, Lord Frederic!" cried he&mdash;
<Q>if we do, remember that we meet no more as friends!</Q>
And, as he &s;poke, he turned from him, and walked with ha&s;ty &s;trides towards the thicke&s;t &s;hades of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Lord Frederic, a&s;toni&s;hed at his demean|our, for which, ignorant that he had ever &s;een the Lady Con&s;tance, he could a&s;&s;ign no adequate cau&s;e, &s;tood for a moment &s;urprized. He would then have called him back; but Sir Albert only quickened his pace.&mdash;Fired with rage, he would then
<PB N="52" REF="028401_0051_0FD8F39CCC8CB138">
have followed him, to demand an expla|nation of his words, and &s;till more of the menacing air with which they had been uttered; but he was now lo&s;t among the trees, and Lord Frederic &s;ought him in vain.</P>
<P>Sir Albert, mean-time, carele&s;s whither he went, walked on. He had fancied his own pa&s;&s;ion hopele&s;s; but, at the moment in which he had heard that Con&s;tance loved his rival, he became con&s;cious that he had hitherto flattered him&s;elf with the per&s;ua|&s;ion that her heart was his own. When he had reached a part of the Fore&s;t con&s;i|derably di&s;tant from the &s;pot where he had left Lord Frederic, he threw him&s;elf heavily on the gra&s;s. and abandoned his &s;oul to the de&s;ponding thoughts which the di&s;|cour&s;e he had heard &s;ugge&s;ted to him.</P>
<P><Q>Lord Frederic is then beloved by Con|&s;tance!</Q>
&s;aid he to him&s;elf:
<Q>the mo|de&s;t maid, who&s;e eyes were ca&s;t down if mine too fondly gazed upon her, has looked on him with tenderne&s;s! Fal&s;e changeful Con&s;tance! yet why do I ac|cu&s;e her? what right had I to her af|fection? what encouragement did &s;he
<PB N="53" REF="028401_0052_0FD8F3A240FCB368">
ever afford to my hopes? To the love which I never avowed to her, what re|turn could I expect?&mdash;Ah! why did I quit her without declaring my&s;elf? What idea could &s;he form of the &s;trength of a pa&s;&s;ion, of which, even in her pre&s;ence, I was &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter to bury it in &s;i|lence? During the years that have elap&s;|ed &s;ince I parted from her, perhaps &s;he has never heard my name pronounced; and, if &s;he has afforded it any place in her remembrance, &s;he has perhaps thought of me as of one from who&s;e heart the impre&s;&s;ion of her charms was already ef|faced; &s;he has fancied her&s;elf more a&s;|&s;ured of the affection of every ca&s;ual ad|mirer who has told her &s;he is fair, than of him to whom &s;he is dearer than his life!&mdash;Ah? why did I quit her with|out declaring my&s;elf?</Q></P>
<P>Sir Albert continued to dwell on this idea with infinite angui&s;h, and would gladly have given years of his future life to recall but a few of the moments which he had formerly pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of Con|&s;tance, when certain of her indifference to every other, his heart had &s;ecretly flat|tered
<PB N="54" REF="028401_0053_0FD8F3A38F372C10">
him &s;he was not without &s;ome pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in his favour, and had not his genero&s;ity forbidden him every at|tempt to improve that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he might po&s;&s;ibly have gained the love, of which one who&s;e black and murderous de|&s;igns rendered him &s;o unworthy of her, now boa&s;ted that he was the object. By degrees, as Sir Albert repeated to him&s;elf Lord Frederic's words, a faint hope aro&s;e in his brea&s;t, that the confidence with which that fierce youth had &s;poken of the favour of Con&s;tance, might have little other foundation than his own vanity; but the &s;atisfaction which this idea afforded him, was almo&s;t in&s;tantly lo&s;t in the recol|lection, that, whatever might be the &s;tate of her affections, the Baron of Dornheim was within three days to receive her hand. He &s;tarted from the ground, and &s;tood for &s;ome moments almo&s;t bereft of thought and rea&s;on. A wi&s;h pre&s;ently ru&s;hed upon his mind, to &s;ee her once more ere that fatal event for ever tore her from his hopes. He had not power to deny him&s;elf that la&s;t gratification; but determined imme|diately to &s;eek admi&s;&s;ion to her pre&s;ence,
<PB N="55" REF="028401_0054_0FD8F3A555859908">
to tell her that his late&s;t breath &s;hould wi&s;h her happine&s;s; and then, bidding an eternal adieu, to his country, to join the armies of the Cru&s;aders, and &s;eek, amid the &s;words of the Infidels, that death which would then be the only object of his de|&s;ires.</P>
<P>Animated by this de&s;ign, he walked on; but he knew not which path would lead him to the Ca&s;tle of Hertzwald, and in that wild Fore&s;t he had little chance of meeting with any one from whom he could obtain directions. He was provoked, to think that he might po&s;&s;ibly have taken a road which would lead him a contrary way from that which he intended; yet he &s;till walked on. At la&s;t he de&s;cried &s;ome turrets through the trees: but much was he di&s;appointed, when, on a nearer ap|proach, he knew them for tho&s;e of Dorn|heim. He turned away with horror from the abode of his rivals, and &s;truck into ano|ther path; in which fortunately he had not proceeded far, when he perceived a pea&s;ant before him. He ha&s;tened to overtake him, and inquired the road to the Ca&s;tle of Hertzwald. The man was him&s;elf going
<PB N="56" REF="028401_0055_0FD8F3ABF89F48F8">
part of the way thither, and offered to be his guide. As they walked together, the pea&s;ant a&s;ked Sir Albert many que&s;tions; but his an&s;wers were &s;hort, and often fo|reign to the purpo&s;e: yet when his con|ductor demanded of him where he meant to lodge that night, it &s;uddenly occurred to him, that in the event of his not being &s;o fortunate that day as to obtain an inter|view with the Lady Con&s;tance, it would be his wi&s;h to remain in the Fore&s;t till the next; and he a&s;ked the pea&s;ant whether he dwelt near, and would afford him a lodging in his cottage? The pea&s;ant replied, that he dwelt not far from the &s;pot where they fir&s;t had met; and readily agreed to give him &s;uch accommodation as he was able. They &s;oon came within &s;ight of the Ca&s;tle of Hertzwald: Sir Albert parted from his guide, and proceeded towards it.</P>
<P>He knew but little of the Father of the Lady Con&s;tance, who during the time of his former acquaintance with her, had been ab&s;ent on a journey, and her Mother, with whom &s;he had then re&s;ided at Prague, was &s;ince dead. He was he&s;itating what mo|tive he &s;hould a&s;&s;ign for his vi&s;it, when he
<PB N="57" REF="028401_0056_0FD8F3AD9638E378">
ob&s;erved a dome&s;tic at the gate: of him he a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions, and learned from his an&s;wers, that the Baron of Dornheim was at that time at the Ca&s;tle, and was to dine there. This intelligence was &s;uffici|ent to deter Sir Albert from &s;eeking ad|mittance till after his departure; for he felt that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to command his emotions in the pre&s;ence of his rival. He therefore quitted the gate, and determined to wait in the vicinity of the Ca&s;tle till the evening. He began to walk to and fro, often looking wi&s;tfully up at the windows, wi&s;hing he could know which were tho&s;e of the apartment of Con&s;tance. He meant to keep at &s;ome di&s;tance from the walls; yet often &s;ome ac|cidental &s;hade on one of the ca&s;ements was magnified by his imagination into an hu|man figure; and he ha&s;tily approached, al|mo&s;t expecting he &s;hould find that it was the Lady Con&s;tance her&s;elf.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, the reflection that he might be ob&s;erved by the dome&s;tics, and incur&s;u&s;pi|cion, induced him to quit the front of the Ca&s;tle, and turn into a path which wound behind it. The Ca&s;tle of Hertz|wald
<PB N="58" REF="028401_0057_0FD8F3B25F2CC620">
was much inferior in &s;ize and &s;trength to that of Dornheim: plea&s;ure, rather than defence appeared to have been the object of its founder. A magnificent garden lay behind it, fenced from the Fo|re&s;t by a high wall, &s;urrounded with bat|tlements. Sir Albert walked on under this wall, with no other view than to pa&s;s away the time till the departure of his rival, who&s;e happine&s;s mean while, in en|joying the pre&s;ence of the Lady Con&s;tance, di&s;tracted his &s;oul with jealous pangs.&mdash; At an angle, of the wall was erected a &s;quare turret, of which the windows looked out upon the Fore&s;t. Sir Albert was pa&s;&s;ing by it, when a voice caught his ear. He looked up; and a window being open, he could di&s;tingui&s;h two female figures in the chamber within; but their faces were not turned towards him. With an invo|luntary curio&s;ity he approached nearer; and could then hear, that &s;he who &s;poke was endeavouring to comfort the other, who was weeping violently, and with many of the arguments &s;o unavailing to tho&s;e who&s;e affliction is real, was urging her to re&s;train her tears.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="028401_0058_0FD8F3B40FC78530">"Suffer me to weep!" returned at la&s;t a gentle voice&mdash;it was the voice of Con|&s;tance; and the heart of Sir Albert in|&s;tantly acknowledged the &s;ound.&mdash;

<P>"This is perhaps the la&s;t time," repli|ed Con&s;tance,

<P><Q>But, if this marriage be indeed &s;o hateful to you, Madam,</Q>
&s;aid the other, "why will you &s;ubmit to it?"</P>

Have not my unwearied &s;upplications repeatedly awakened his fierce&s;t anger, and provoked him to treat me with a har&s;hne&s;s, which, but a few months &s;ince, I could not have &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould have &s;urvived? Thou knowe&s;t how little he regards my tears; and if to-day I have obtained this &s;mall indulgence to with|draw my&s;elf from the Baron's pre&s;ence, I have owed it rather to the fear le&s;t he &s;hould too plainly perceive, by my de|meanour, my reluctance to the marriage, than to any pity for my &s;ufferings: but the Baron does know my reluctance to the marriage. I one day collected &s;uf|ficient boldne&s;s to avow it to him, in the hope, that, if his &s;oul were capable of any generous feelings, he would of his own accord reject the hand of a mai|den who&s;e heart was aver&s;e to him; but I &s;oon found that I have judged too highly of him; and that the only effect of my avowal was, that he pre&s;&s;ed the marriage with greater eagerne&s;s than be|fore, le&s;t delay &s;hould afford me time to devi&s;e &s;ome means of e&s;caping it.</Q></P>

<Q>Were any place of refuge open to me, thou may'&s;t a&s;&s;ure thy&s;elf I &s;hould he watched. What friend have I, in who&s;e protection I could tru&s;t?

<P>"I mu&s;t entreat you, Madam," &s;aid Elinor,
<Q>to forgive me for what I am about to &s;ay: the intere&s;t I feel in your concerns could alone urge me to a que&s;|tion, which I tru&s;t you will be too well a&s;&s;ured of my attachment, to a&s;cribe to impertinence or curio&s;ity.

<P>Sir Albert li&s;tened more eagerly than before.</P>
<P>"If mi&s;take not greatly," returned the Lady Con&s;tance,
<Q>that ca&s;que had once another owner.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="66" REF="028401_0065_0FD8F3CAF89DC640">"To one whom thou ha&s;t never &s;een," replied Con&s;tance;&mdash; <Q>to one whom I will never &s;ee again!</Q></P>
<P>"Was he then the lover who gained your affections?" demanded the dam&s;el.</P>
<P>"He loved me once," &s;aid Con&s;tance,
<Q>but he knew not with what &s;entiments I regarded him. I was per&s;uaded that my Father would never con&s;ent to our union; and I purpo&s;ely &s;lighted him, in the hope of eradicating from his brea&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion which could only render him mi&s;erable.

<P><Q>And how can you imagine it po&s;&s;ible he can have forgotten you?</Q>
replied the enraptured Albert, pre&s;enting him&s;elf be|fore the window.&mdash;
<Q>Ah! lovelie&s;t Con|&s;tance! how little are you acquainted with the power of your own charms, if

you &s;uppo&s;e that the heart which once confe&s;&s;ed it, could ever know a &s;econd love!</Q></P>
<P>At the &s;ound of his well-known voice, Con&s;tance flew to the window; but when &s;he beheld him, &s;he trembled, and had nearly fainted; and, when &s;he would have &s;poken to him, his name was all that &s;he was able to pronounce.&mdash;He gazed on her with a tran&s;port which left him no re|membrance of any of the difficulties which &s;till remained to encounter.</P>
<P>"My adored Con&s;tance!" exclaimed he,
<Q>how infinitely am I repaid at this moment for all the &s;ufferings of my tedi|ous ab&s;ence!&mdash;though bani&s;hed from your pre&s;ence I have been in&s;en&s;ible to every plea&s;ure; though equally uncon|&s;cious and unde&s;erving of your, love, every anxious fear, every jealous doubt has di&s;tracted my &s;oul!</Q></P>
<P>"But whence&mdash;" cried &s;he, with an ha&s;tening and interrupted voice&mdash;
<Q>how came you&mdash;? in this remote Fore&s;t. I had not expected&mdash;I thought you far di&s;tant:&mdash;what chance has brought you hither?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="028401_0067_0FD8F3D41CEFA378">"My impatience to review you," re|turned he,
<Q>was the &s;ole motive of my journey.

<P>"Heavens! exclaimed &s;he,
<Q>and have you then heard what I have carele&s;sly &s;poken?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Can you forgive me, deare&s;t Con|&s;tance?</Q>
&s;aid Sir Albert:
<Q>I expected to have heard you avow your preference of my rival; the apprehen&s;ion was too painful to be borne; and I could not re|&s;olve to tear my&s;elf from the &s;pot where your voice fir&s;t caught my car, till the dreadful certainty &s;hould free me from the torture of &s;u&s;pence:&mdash;from that I indeed am freed; and the fear le&s;t I &s;hould have incurred your di&s;plea&s;ure by pre&s;uming to li&s;ten to your di&s;cour&s;e, is now the only trouble of which my &s;oul
<PB N="69" REF="028401_0068_0FD8F3D51BE9D7F0">
is in&s;en&s;ible.&mdash;Can you forgive me, Con|&s;tance?</Q></P>
<P><Q>If you have occa&s;ioned me any di&s;|plea&s;ure,</Q>
returned &s;he,
<Q>it has been by the &s;u&s;picion which impelled you to li&s;ten. I would not, methinks, that you &s;hould have heard with what &s;enti|ments I thought of you;&mdash;but that you &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e I harboured &s;uch for any other:</Q>
&mdash;</P>
<P>Overcome with joy at this unexpected meeting, Sir Albert &s;poke freely of the love which, for &s;o many years, he had bu|ried in unbroken &s;ilence; and the Lady Con&s;tance, forgetful of the re&s;erve which had formerly induced her to reject even his mo&s;t di&s;tant courte&s;ies, acknowledged the affection with which he had long &s;ince in&s;pired her heart. She was, however, the fir&s;t who awoke from this dream of tran&s;|port; &s;he recollected her &s;ituation, and bur&s;t into tears.&mdash;He eagerly demanded their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>"Alas!" cried &s;he,
<Q>we have only met, that may the more &s;everely feel the pain of our eternal &s;eparation!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="028401_0069_0FD8F3D688941F08">"Never! exclaimed he;
<Q>never, my Con&s;tance! &s;halt thou be torn from me!</Q></P>
<P>"But how," &s;aid &s;he
<Q>can I e&s;cape the dreadful fate to which they de&s;tine me?</Q></P>
<P>"Fly from their power!" returned Sir Albert:
<Q>this arm &s;hall &s;hield you from pur&s;uit!&mdash;It is not my own intere&s;t.</Q>
pur&s;ued he,
<Q>which could ever have in|duced me to urge you to &s;uch a &s;tep. When I formerly knew you, encircled with pro&s;perity, I would rather have died than have propo&s;ed to you to &s;hare my poorer fortunes; and had you but now given me rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e you could be happy with my rival, believe me, my Con&s;tance! no di&s;traction to which &s;uch an idea would have driven me, could ever have in&s;pired me with any wi&s;h to di&s;turb that happine&s;s. But, &s;ituated as you are, it is to re&s;cue you from mi&s;ery, not to en&s;ure to my|&s;elf the highe&s;t earthly ble&s;&s;ing, that I intreat you to fly with me from him who would &s;o unworthily avail him&s;elf of your father's power to force you to the marriage which you dread. I know the
<PB N="71" REF="028401_0070_0FD8F3DBA6E28F30">
delicacy of your mind; and I know how unavailing the &s;plendor of the &s;ituation to which the Baron of Dornheim could rai&s;e you, would be to con&s;titute your felicity.&mdash;I can offer you no riches; nor would I, even at this moment, my adored Con&s;tance! a&s;k your hand, could I any otherwi&s;e than by receiving it, be en|titled to the character of your protector.</Q>
The Lady Con&s;tance li&s;tened, and her heart acknowledged the genero&s;ity of tho&s;e &s;entiments, of which the former conduct of Sir Albert had left her no room to doubt the &s;incerity: yet &s;he he&s;itated to comply. Never had &s;he hitherto di&s;obeyed her Fa|ther; unle&s;s it had been by the involuntary affection &s;he entertained for him who&s;e merits de&s;erved her tendere&s;t love, but who&s;e &s;ituation, &s;he well knew, would preclude him from any chance in his favour. And now to fly the marriage en|forced by his commands, and to give her hand in oppo&s;ition to his will;&mdash;&s;he was alarmed at the idea, and her &s;trict &s;en&s;e of duty forbade her to con&s;ent. But Elinor, who had hitherto taken no part in the di&s;cour&s;e, now interpo&s;ed, and in the
<PB N="72" REF="028401_0071_0FD8F3DC880CC698">
&s;tronge&s;t terms, &s;upported the propo&s;al of Sir Albert. She urged every excu&s;e which the peculiar &s;ituation of the Lady Con&s;tance offered for her compliance; reminded her in how &s;hort a time her e&s;cape from the Baron would be impo&s;&s;ible; and placed before her in the mo&s;t odi|ous colours, every circum&s;tance of the projected marriage, which &s;he knew in|&s;pired her with the greate&s;t dread. She even repre&s;ented to her the guilt &s;he would incur by fal&s;ely plighting her faith to him, while &s;he was con&s;cious of the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of recalling her affections from their fir&s;t and only object. Again&s;t the&s;e argu|ments, again&s;t the per&s;ua&s;ions of Sir Al|bert, and the pleadings of her own heart in his favour, the Lady Con&s;tance was unable to defend her&s;elf; &s;he yielded to their force, and con&s;ented to entru&s;t her|&s;elf to the protection of her lover. Tran&s;|ported at her compliance, he would have had her in&s;tantly throw her&s;elf from the window where &s;he &s;tood, which was not &s;o high but that &s;he might have done it without danger; for he was anxious to avail him&s;elf of the pre&s;ent moment, as
<PB N="73" REF="028401_0072_0FD8F3DEC7FBBB50">
well becau&s;e he feared le&s;t &s;he &s;hould re|cede from her intentions, as becau&s;e many circum&s;tances might intervene to render her e&s;cape, at any future time, le&s;s ea&s;y. But Elinor earne&s;tly di&s;&s;uaded her from this: &s;he &s;aid that many of the Baron's attendants were wandering in the Fore&s;t, awaiting the time of his departure; and &s;he was urging many other difficulties, when Sir Albert him&s;elf recollected a cir|cum&s;tance which obliged him to give up the idea; he had left his hor&s;es at the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim; and it was impo&s;&s;ible for Con&s;tance to proceed &s;o far on foot as to the neare&s;t town where others might be procured. He therefore concurred in the arrangement propo&s;ed by Elinor, who offered, when all the family &s;hould be re|tired to re&s;t, to admit him into the garden, towards which looked the chamber of the Lady Con&s;tance, who, on &s;eeing him, &s;hould let her&s;elf down from the window, and &s;hould be conveyed by him to his hor&s;e. Elinor entreated that &s;he might be the companion of her flight; to which &s;he, with much &s;atisfaction, agreed. It afterwards, however, occurred to the dam|&s;el
<PB N="74" REF="028401_0073_0FD8F3DF456CAC00">
that it would be better if Sir Albert had the key of the garden, and were to admit him&s;elf; &s;ince then &s;he need not quit her mi&s;tre&s;s at the moment when her pre&s;ence might be of &s;o much avail to &s;upport her &s;pirits, and confirm her re&s;o|lution; &s;he could not at that time go in que&s;t of it, becau&s;e it lay in the room in which the Baron of Dornheim was enter|tained; but, as &s;oon as he &s;hould quit the Ca&s;tle, &s;he &s;aid &s;he could ea&s;ily po&s;|&s;e&s;s her&s;elf of it; and &s;he reque&s;ted Sir Al|bert to tell her where he might be found by her, when &s;he &s;hould bring it to him. He de&s;cribed the &s;ituation of the Cottage of the Pea&s;ant who had offered him a lodging; and there &s;he promi&s;ed he &s;hould &s;ee her &s;oon after &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>After a little further di&s;cour&s;e between him and the Lady Con&s;tance, which they terminated by the interchange of the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es of affection and fidelity, the nece&s;&s;ity of his ha&s;tening to recover his hor&s;es, or to procure others in their &s;tead, obliged him to tear him&s;elf from her. Ere he departed, &s;he drew a white
<PB N="75" REF="028401_0074_0FD8F3DF4C0C26F8">
plume from her hair, and threw it to him from the window.</P>
<P>"Wear this in your ca&s;que," &s;aid &s;he:
<Q>I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h it by the light of the moon: and I &s;hall fly without appre|hen&s;ion of mi&s;take, to the only protector in whom I would confide!</Q></P>
<P>Sir Albert ki&s;&s;ed the plume, and placed it in his ca&s;que.
<Q>May I ever give you cau&s;e to continue that confidence in me, my beloved Con&s;tance!</Q>
cried he:&mdash;
<Q>And be a&s;&s;ured that I &s;hall value this pledge of your affection more highly than my life. Good Angels guard you till we meet again!&mdash;till we meet!&mdash; tran&s;porting thought!&mdash; to part no more!</Q></P>
<P>Even that idea did not enable Sir Al|bert to quit the window without pain; but Elinor repeatedly reminding him of the importance of the expedition, he at la&s;t complied with her in&s;tances, and bade the Lady Con&s;tance a final adieu.</P>
<P>It had been his intention to repair to the Cottage of the Pea&s;ant, and to pro|cure &s;ome me&s;&s;enger whom he might thence di&s;patch to the ca&s;tle of Dorn|heim (whether he had re&s;olved he never
<PB N="76" REF="028401_0075_0FD8F3E3C3590E40">
would him&s;elf return) to order his E&s;quire to ha&s;ten to him immediately with his hor&s;es. He deemed it unnece&s;&s;ary to make any excu&s;e to the Baron for his abrupt departure, &s;ince Lord Frederic, who&s;e more immediate gue&s;t he had been, might well &s;uppo&s;e that it was in con&s;e|quence of their conference in the Fore&s;t: and he left it to him to place it in what light he &s;hould chu&s;e, to his Father. His purpo&s;e, however, was anticipated; for he was not yet out of &s;ight of the Ca&s;tle of Hertzwald when Maurice met him. The E&s;quire expre&s;&s;ed great joy to review his ma&s;ter; and recounted to him, that on his not returning with Lord Frederic, he had been much troubled; and after waiting &s;ome time without being able to procure any intelligence of him, he had at la&s;t concluded he mu&s;t be gone to vi&s;it the Lady Con&s;tance, whom he well knew his impatience to review; and that he had therefore taken that road in que&s;t of him. Sir Albert commended his diligence, and imparted to him the happy re&s;ult of the conference he had with her, and her pro|mi&s;e to fly with him that night from her
<PB N="77" REF="028401_0076_0FD8F3E4D257E088">
Father's Ca&s;tle: he added, that it was his intention to carry her to Vienna; and, as &s;oon as the rites of the Church &s;hould have rendered her indi&s;&s;olubly his, to demand the protection of the Emperor, who&s;e for|mer marks of favour left him no doubt of obtaining it, again&s;t any exertions which might be made by the Baron of Dornheim to force her from him; and he flattered him&s;elf that the interce&s;&s;ion of &s;o power|ful a mediator might di&s;po&s;e her Father to an earlier reconciliation than could otherwi&s;e be rea&s;onably expected.</P>
<P>While he was &s;peaking he heard the trampling of hor&s;es; and he retired behind &s;ome trees to avoid them. It was the Ba|ron and his troop, returning to the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim.&mdash;Sir Albert felt a degree of &s;atisfaction, that he had quitted that of Hertzwald without having had time to &s;ee the Lady Con&s;tance. After they had pa&s;|&s;ed, he walked on with Maurice; and en|quiring of him for his hor&s;es, the E&s;quire replied, that he had left them at the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim, not knowing his intention to return thither no more. Sir Albert or|dered him to go immediately and bring
<PB N="78" REF="028401_0077_0FD8F3E67637A768">
them to him at the pea&s;ant's cottage; whither he ha&s;tened him&s;elf, imagining that, &s;ince the Baron was already departed, Elinor would &s;peedily vi&s;it him with the key which was to admit him into the gar|den of Hertzwald.</P>
<P>His generous temper never open to mi&s;tru&s;t, induced him to place a full con|fidence in the intere&s;t &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed in her mi&s;tre&s;s's concerns. The a&s;&s;ertion of Lord Frederic, that one of the dam|&s;els of the Lady Con&s;tance was in his pay, had not, in tho&s;e moments of joy, recurred to his memory; nor, though it had, would Sir Albert ever have &s;u&s;pected that dam|&s;el to be Elinor. Yet Elinor had for &s;ome time been won by the gifts of Lord Fre|deric, to convey to him private intelligence of every confidence her mi&s;tre&s;s repo&s;ed in her. She had hitherto flattered him with the per&s;ua&s;ion, that the Lady Con&s;tance &s;lighted his Father on account of the pre|ference &s;he felt for him&s;elf; and it was with a view of leading her to an avowal of this that &s;he had begun the conference, which contrary to her hopes, had drawn from her the confe&s;&s;ion of her love for Sir Albert.

Di&s;appointed by this, and &s;till more by his &s;udden appearance, Elinor had only li&s;tened to the di&s;cour&s;e which en&s;ued be|tween them, with a view of betraying their mutual intere&s;ts to Lord Frederic; and, having formed a &s;cheme which &s;he was per&s;uaded would be very acceptable to him, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her&s;elf of the key, and &s;et out, not for the Cottage where Sir Al|bert awaited her, but for the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim. She was clo&s;ely veiled, left any of the dome&s;tics of the Baron &s;hould know that &s;he belonged to the Lady Con|&s;tance; and, as it had been her cu&s;tom in former vi&s;its &s;he had made there, &s;he in|quired for one whom &s;he knew to be par|ticularly attached to Lord Frederic, by whom &s;he was immediately and privately conducted to his chamber.</P>
<P>On his return from following Sir Al|bert, he had found that his Father was gone to the Ca&s;tle of Hertzwald, whither him&s;elf had received no invitation; and he had pa&s;&s;ed the day alone, freely in|dulging the wild di&s;traction of his mind, and forming new &s;chemes of violence.&mdash; At the entrance of Elinor, his counten|ance

was brightened by a gleam of hope; and he eagerly a&s;ked her what news &s;he brought him?</P>
<P>"Such, my Lord," returned &s;he,
<Q>as I tru&s;t when you &s;hall have heard it all, you will deem de&s;erving of &s;ome thanks: but the fir&s;t circum&s;tance I mu&s;t im|part to you, will be little welcome&mdash;you have a rival, hitherto unthought of.</Q></P>
<P>"Who?&mdash;what rival?" exclaimed he.</P>
<P>"Let me fir&s;t, my Lord," &s;aid the dam&s;el,
<Q>reque&s;t you to tell me whence you obtained the ca&s;que you wore when la&s;t you vi&s;ited our Ca&s;tle?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I had it from a Knight in the Imperi|al &s;ervice,</Q>
replied Lord Frederic:
<Q>he lent it to me once, when I was &s;ent up|on a &s;udden expedition: I liked it&mdash;was lighter than my own;&mdash;and I gave him another in exchange for it.&mdash;But what of that ca&s;que?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Was that Knight named Albert, my Lord?</Q>
demanded Elinor.</P>
<P>"He was," returned Lord Frederic.</P>
<P>"Then know in him," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>the favoured lover of the Lady Con&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="028401_0080_0FD8F3F246810618">Lord Frederic &s;tarted from his &s;eat in fury; he recollected the manner in which his conference with Sir Albert had termi|nated in the morning, and he wondered he had not before di&s;covered what he was now &s;o incen&s;ed to learn. His rage vented it&s;elf in many horrid imprecations; and &s;carcely could Elinor re&s;train him from going in&s;tantly in que&s;t of the rival, on whom he thir&s;ted to avenge him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Were you more calm, my Lord," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>I could direct you to a &s;urer vengeance than, your &s;word could give you.</Q></P>
<P>"What vengeance", cried Lord Fre|deric:
<Q>tell me of vengeance, and I will li&s;ten to thee.</Q></P>
<P>"This night," returned Elinor,
<Q>Sir Albert is to &s;teal away the Lady Con|&s;tance. I know not whether &s;he would have con&s;ented to this mea&s;ure, had not I per&s;uaded her: but I overcame her &s;cruples; and I have promi&s;ed to admit him into the garden, where &s;he is to meet him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="028401_0081_0FD8F3F638118400">"Thou, Elinor!" exclaimed Lord Fre|deric:

<P><Q>I &s;hall leave that to your own deci|&s;ion, my Lord,</Q>
replied &s;he.
<Q>Here is the key of the garden-gate; and here is a white plume, which if you place in the front of your ca&s;que, Con&s;tance will &s;ly to you as to Sir Albert, and you may bear her whither you will.</Q></P>
<P>"My excellent Elinor?" cried he:
<Q>in this device I recognize thy genius. This will indeed avenge me on them both!</Q></P>

<Q>When once before, un&s;u&s;|picious of this pre-occupation of her heart, I would have coun&s;elled you to propo&s;e to the Lady Con&s;tance a flight with you, to avoid the marriage to which I knew &s;he was aver&s;e, you objected the detriment which might ari&s;e to your own fortunes, from an action which would &s;o greatly irritate your Father.</Q></P>
<P>"I care not for that now," exclaimed the impetuous youth:
<Q>I would &s;acrifice my fortunes, nay my life, rather than mi&s;s this glorious opportunity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="028401_0082_0FD8F3F9CBAD6CF8">
<Q>But you need endanger neither, my Lord,</Q>
returned the dam&s;el&mdash;
<Q>I have offered to attend the Lady Con&s;tance in her flight; let me therefore return the following morning to the Ca&s;tle, and I will throw the imputation on Sir Albert, with &s;uch circum&s;tances as &s;hall not only prevent any &s;u&s;picion from fa&s;tening on you, but &s;hall determine both her Father and your own to wreak on him the rage which the wrong they will &s;uppo&s;e him to have done them will in&s;pire. I am going to him now, to inform him, as from his mi&s;tre&s;s, that &s;he will fly with him to-morrow night, in&s;tead of this: to-morrow, therefore, he will volunta|rily throw him&s;elf into their hands; and judge my Lord, whether the Baron of Dornheim, believing him the rival who has robbed him of his bride, will prove a reluctant executioner of the &s;evere&s;t vengeance your fury could dictate to your wi&s;hes.</Q></P>
<P>However &s;atisfactory Elinor had ima|gined the plot &s;he had thus treacherou&s;ly laid, would prove to Lord Frederic, his tran&s;ports &s;till exceeded her expectations.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="028401_0083_0FD8F3FB44E4E630">He promi&s;ed her the mo&s;t boundle&s;s re|wards, and as an earne&s;t of them, pre&s;ent|ed her with a rich jewel he wore on his finger.

She then quitted him, and ha&s;tened to the Cottage, where Sir Albert had long waited in anxious expectation of her. When he &s;aw her approach, he went ha&s;tily out to meet her, and demanded whether &s;he had brought him the promi&s;ed key?</P>
<P>"Alas! no, Sir!" returned &s;he, with a well-di&s;&s;embled concern&mdash;
<Q>the Lady Con&s;tance has &s;ent me the reluctant bearer of a me&s;&s;age, which, I fear will greatly di&s;appoint you: it will be im|po&s;&s;ible for her this night to leave the Ca&s;tle.</Q></P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" exclaimed Sir Albert:
<Q>O Elinor! what cruel tidings do&s;t thou bring me! Will Con&s;tance violate her promi&s;e?</Q></P>
<P>"Not willingly, valiant Sir!" replied the dam&s;el;
<Q>nor indeed are you to con&s;i|der
<PB N="85" REF="028401_0084_0FD8F401196AA338">
this any other than a &s;hort delay of a mea&s;ure in which her happine&s;s is, if po&s;&s;ible, more concerned than your own. To-morrow night you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf &s;he will be yours.</Q></P>
<P>"But why not to-night?" cried he.</P>
<P>"Sir," an&s;wered Elinor,
<Q>when, after the Baron's departure, I went in que&s;t of the key, I found that it had been remov|ed from its cu&s;tomary place, and the Lady Con&s;tance &s;oon learned, with great di&s;quietude, that her Father was gone from home on &s;ome &s;udden bu&s;ine&s;s, and that, uncertain at what hour he might return, he had taken with him the key of the garden, meaning to re|admit him&s;elf that way, without oblig|ing his family to watch for him.</Q></P>
<P>"But if he has taken the key," cried Sir Albert impatiently, <Q>why cannot I &s;cale the wall?</Q></P>
<P>"Alas! Sir," replied &s;he,
<Q>and do you not then con&s;ider the danger of his re|turning at the moment to &s;urprize you? &s;hould he meet you in your flight with the Lady Con&s;tance, what but eternal ruin to your hopes could be the con&s;e|quence?
<PB N="86" REF="028401_0085_0FD8F402CB262FE0">
He would certainly attempt to force her from you; and, &s;hould you de|fend her, think what would be her &s;en|&s;ations &s;hould her Father fall by your hand! Her mind is &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the idea, that I am confident, no arguments you could urge, would per|&s;uade her this night to venture:&mdash;but to-morrow no &s;uch dangers will threaten you; and to-morrow you may depend on her flying with you, to e&s;cape the tyranny of tho&s;e who would force her to e&s;pou&s;e the man whom &s;he dete&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Albert was by no means di&s;po&s;ed to content him&s;elf with this delay of his hopes, but Elinor &s;aid &s;o much, and with &s;uch an appearance of a &s;incere attachment to his intere&s;ts, that he was at la&s;t obliged to &s;ubmit, and to con&s;ent to wait till the following night. The dam&s;el promi&s;ed to re-vi&s;it him in the morning, to bring him word whether he might &s;afely attempt an|other conference with the Lady Con&s;tance during the cour&s;e of the day, and likewi&s;e to arrange with him finally the mode of her e&s;cape. She then quitted him, and went back to the Ca&s;tle of Hertzwald;
<PB N="87" REF="028401_0086_0FD8F40787F22A18">
when to her mi&s;tre&s;s, who had longed for her return, &s;he accounted for the length of her ab&s;ence, by feigning that Sir Albert had detained her with innumerable que&s;|tions re&s;pecting all that had befallen the object of his love during their tedious &s;e|paration. The deceived Con&s;tance was plea&s;ed at every in&s;tance of the tender in|tere&s;t he took in her concerns: yet, during the ab&s;ence of Elinor, her re&s;olution had begun to waver, and her apprehen&s;ions of the guilt &s;he &s;hould contract, by a marri|age contrary to the will of her Father, had almo&s;t determined her to &s;tay, and &s;uffer him to &s;acrifice her happine&s;s for ever. But the crafty di&s;cour&s;es of the dam&s;el re|vived &s;o &s;trongly in her brea&s;t her horror for the Baron, and her love for the valiant Albert, that &s;he was confirmed in her for|mer intentions; and with a kind of dread le&s;t further reflection &s;hould finally oblige her to renounce them, &s;he awaited the hour appointed for her flight.</P>
<P>She retired earlier than u&s;ual to her chamber; for her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her in|tended di&s;obedience overwhelmed her in the pre&s;ence of her Father, with all the
<PB N="88" REF="028401_0087_0FD8F408C5AE2D88">
confu&s;ion of guilt; and, unaccu&s;tomed to di&s;&s;emble, &s;he fancied that her every look betrayed the hidden purpo&s;e of her heart. Had he conver&s;ed with her with kindne&s;s, &s;he would have found it impo&s;&s;ible to command her feelings; but, with more than u&s;ual har&s;hne&s;s, he reproved her for the aver&s;ion &s;he expre&s;&s;ed towards him, whom it was his plea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould e&s;|pou&s;e, and exaggerated the pa&s;&s;ion with which her charms had in&s;pired the Baron, in &s;uch terms as tended only to heighten the di&s;gu&s;t with which &s;he thought of him. She heard in &s;ilence; for &s;he dared not tru&s;t her&s;elf to an&s;wer: but, when &s;he left the room, the idea &s;truck upon her mind, that &s;he quitted it, not for a night, but perhaps for ever; and &s;he bur&s;t into tears. In her own chamber &s;he wept for &s;ome time without re&s;traint; while Elinor was bu&s;ied in preparing &s;uch things as it was expedient &s;he &s;hould be provided with on her journey.</P>
<P>In the mean time the family retired to re&s;t, and the hour approached, at which Sir Albert was to arrive. The heart of Con&s;tance palpitated with expectation,
<PB N="89" REF="028401_0088_0FD8F40E224C74E0">
and her tears cea&s;ed to flow. Nor had &s;he expected long, before &s;he de&s;cried a figure in the garden; his arms, as he ad|vanced, glittered to the moon-beam; and he was &s;oon &s;o near, that &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the white feather in his ca&s;que. He came under her window; and Elinor, apprehen|&s;ive le&s;t her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould ob&s;erve that his voice was not that of Sir Albert ha&s;|tily de&s;ired him in a whi&s;per, not to &s;peak, le&s;t he &s;hould be heard by any one who might yet be &s;tirring in the Ca&s;tle. He comprehended her meaning, and made her a &s;ign of obedience. For Con&s;tance, it had been unnece&s;&s;ary to enjoin her &s;i|lence;&mdash;for the fir&s;t time in her life, &s;he was about to commit an action, of which &s;he doubted the propriety; and on that action the whole of her future fate was to depend:&mdash;her emotion was &s;o &s;trong, that it hardly left her the power of &s;peech; and &s;he would even yet have receded from her purpo&s;e, and remained at the Ca&s;tle, but Elinor reproached her irre&s;olution, and repre&s;ented to her, that if &s;he neglected the pre&s;ent moment, e&s;cape at any future one would be impo&s;&s;ible. She had pre|viou&s;ly
<PB N="90" REF="028401_0089_0FD8F40FCE1DB178">
provided a ladder of ropes, and the trembling Con&s;tance de&s;cended from the window.</P>
<P>Ere &s;he reached the ground, her tran&s;|ported lover caught her to his brea&s;t; &s;he was offended at a boldne&s;s &s;o new to her, and di&s;engaged her&s;elf from his arms, in a manner &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of her di&s;|plea&s;ure. Apprehen&s;ive of too &s;oon alarm|ing her, he re&s;trained his pa&s;&s;ion, and with a re&s;pectful air, led her towards the gate of the garden, where a confidential &s;ervant was waiting with two fleet hor&s;es. He vaulted on one, taking before him in his arms his lovely and un&s;u&s;pecting prize: his &s;ervant, in the &s;ame manner, took charge of Elinor: and applying &s;purs to their hor&s;es, they &s;at out with the utmo&s;t &s;peed.</P>
<P>Meantime, the real Sir Albert, little imagining for what purpo&s;e his name and cre&s;t had been a&s;&s;umed, had &s;at for &s;ome time, after the dam&s;el had left him, in|dulging his di&s;appointment at the me&s;&s;age &s;he had treacherou&s;ly brought him. Mau|rice was not yet returned with the hor&s;es: Sir Albert wi&s;hed for his arrival, that he
<PB N="91" REF="028401_0090_0FD8BEE9216A88F0">
might have with him one to whom he could &s;peak freely on the &s;ubject which oc|cupied him; and at la&s;t, impatiently ri&s;ing, he walked forth into the Fore&s;t, where for a while he &s;trolled, di&s;quieting him&s;elf with inventing new ob&s;tacles which might ari&s;e to prevent the accompli&s;hment of his hopes on the morrow. The night was now &s;et in, and its &s;hades &s;eemed to offer &s;ome relief to the trouble of Sir Albert; for they revived in his memory the re|flections which had agitated his mind, when, at a &s;imilar hour, he had traver&s;ed that part of the Fore&s;t the preceding night; and when he recollected how in|valuable he &s;hould then have thought the certainty which he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of the love of Con&s;tance, he was a&s;hamed of having &s;o far &s;uffered the delay of the promi&s;e, which &s;he &s;till meant to fulfil, to prey upon his peace: he endeavour|ed to dive&s;t him&s;elf of every de&s;ponding fear, and earne&s;tly recommended the ob|ject of his affections to the protection of every Saint and Holy Angel.</P>
<P>He then recollected, that, by wander|ing at &s;o late an hour, he was detaining
<PB N="92" REF="028401_0091_0FD8F41586963FB0">
from re&s;t the pea&s;ant to who&s;e courte&s;y he was indebted for a lodging; but he had attended &s;o little to his way, that he was at a lo&s;s to determine which path would lead him back to his cortage. He was &s;till he&s;itating, when he de&s;cried at &s;ome di&s;tance, a light, glimmering through the trees. He ha&s;tened towards it; but &s;oon perceived that it was brighter than could proceed from a candle in a pea&s;ant's win|dow. Still he advanced:&mdash;it &s;eemed to recede before him. Surprized and &s;truck with &s;ome emotion of dread, he &s;till fol|lowed it; when &s;uddenly it &s;unk into the earth, and Sir Albert perceived that he was at the mouth of the <HI>Cavern of Death.</HI></P>
<P>His dream, the &s;trange accounts he had received at the Ca&s;tle of Dornheim, and the determination he had formed to explore the my&s;teries of that di&s;mal place, of which the various events of the day had &s;u&s;pend|ed the remembrance, now ru&s;hed at once upon his mind; the di&s;appointment which had prevented his quitting the Fore&s;t that night, now appeared to him the interpo&s;i|tion of that de&s;tiny which had re&s;erved him for the di&s;covery of &s;ome dire &s;ecret;
<PB N="93" REF="028401_0092_0FD8F418DE6B23D0">
and he re&s;olved immediately to attempt the adventure, to which the inward pre|&s;ages of his &s;oul &s;o &s;trongly impelled him.</P>
<P>The night was not du&s;k; but, in that &s;pot, the thick &s;hadow of the trees diffu&s;ed a gloom through which objects were &s;carce di&s;cernable; yet a few gleams of light were reflected by a narrow but rapid &s;tream, which having its &s;ource in the innermo&s;t part of the Cavern, forced its pa&s;&s;age through the rocks, a little below the only entrance it pre&s;ented to human feet. That entrance, for many years untrod, was half overgrown by briars, amid which &s;cream|ed the birds of night. Sir Albert at|tempted to &s;eparate the branches; but the want of a light embarra&s;&s;ed him; and, but a few paces beyond the, mouth of the Cavern, the darkne&s;s was total. He judged it nece&s;&s;ary to return to the pea&s;ant's cot|tage to procure a torch: as he now knew in what part of the Fore&s;t he was, he found the way thither without difficulty.</P>
<P>At the door he was met by Maurice, who was arrived then with his hor&s;es, and who had wondered at his ab&s;ence, know|ing that it was already the hour at which
<PB N="94" REF="028401_0093_0FD8F41A0B96ACC0">
he had appointed to repair to the Ca&s;tle of Hertzwald. Sir Albert acquainted him with the alteration that had taken place in his &s;chemes, and with his intention to enter immediately the <HI>Cavern of Death.</HI> Maurice heard him with vi&s;ible con&s;terna|tion, and would have remon&s;trated; but Sir Albert interrupted him&mdash;</P>
<P>"Be &s;atisfied," &s;aid he,
<Q>that I require not thee to follow me. Wert thou le&s;s &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly fearful, thy company on &s;uch an adventure, would to my&s;elf di|mini&s;h the &s;en&s;ation of awe with which my mind is even painfully impre&s;&s;ed; but coward as thou art, thou could&s;t afford me no a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Remain here with my hor&s;es, and await my return.&mdash; If no evil befall me, thou &s;halt &s;ee me ere the morning dawn.</Q></P>
<P>He then went into the cottage, and de|manded a torch. When the pea&s;ant heard the purpo&s;e for which he required it, he expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame horror which was vi&s;i|ble in the countenances of all in who&s;e pre&s;ence the <HI>Cavern of Death</HI> was named.</P>
<P>"Alas! valiant Sir!" cried he,
<Q>what de&s;perate project have you formed? No
<PB N="95" REF="028401_0094_0FD8F41F47A43128">
human being has ever entered it, and returned to the regions of the living.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Albert continued un&s;haken in his re&s;olution.&mdash;The pea&s;ant reluctantly gave him a torch, and he returned alone to the mouth of the Cavern.</P>
<P>Though his &s;oul was fortified with a courage which ro&s;e &s;uperior to every dan|ger, yet his imagination was affected by the various terrific circum&s;tances which attended the adventure he had undertaken; and if his ear caught the light flutter of the leaves, or if the &s;hadow of a branch, agi|tated by the wind, waved acro&s;s his path, he &s;tarted, and for an in&s;tant fancied it &s;u|pernatural.</P>
<P>When he reached the Cavern, he again attempted to di&s;entangle the briars which ob&s;tructed his entrance: but finding it difficult, he drew his &s;word, and with that &s;oon opened him&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age. The birds, which had long been accu&s;tomed to roo&s;t undi&s;turbed among their branches, now rou&s;ed, flew out in &s;uch numbers, that Sir Albert found it nece&s;&s;ary to retire a few &s;teps, left, as they all made towards the light, the motion of their wings &s;hould
<PB N="96" REF="028401_0095_0FD8F422EA1FEB98">
extingui&s;h his torch. When they were di&s;per&s;ed, he again advanced; and finding the pa&s;&s;age now clear, he commended him|&s;elf to the protection of his Tutelary Saint, and entered the Cavern. For a few paces he proceeded with his &s;word &s;till drawn; but his path &s;oon became &s;o difficult, by rea&s;on of the large fragments of the broken rocks over which he was obliged to climb, that he found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;heath it, that he might be at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t him&s;elf with his hand; and indeed of no encounter with &s;uch enemies as it might avail again&s;t, had he, in that place, any apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>As he advanced, the horrors of the Ca|vern &s;eemed to deepen. The chill damp air froze the current of his blood: the &s;i|lence was only broken, at di&s;tant intervals, by droppings from the roof, encru&s;ted with half congealed vapours. At every &s;tep he trod more lightly; and if &s;ometimes his foot &s;lid upon a &s;mooth and &s;lippery &s;tone, his heart, at the &s;ound beat with a quicker motion. By degrees, he approached the bed of the &s;ubterraneous &s;tream which he had ob&s;erved i&s;&s;uing near the mouth of the Cavern; and the death-like &s;tillne&s;s of the
<PB N="97" REF="028401_0096_0FD8F425468DB818">
place was interrupted by the noi&s;e of its current, fir&s;t, murmuring at a di&s;tance, then, as his path wound nearer to it, roar|ing with impetuous fury over the rough rocks which ob&s;tructed its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Albert now found him&s;elf obliged to &s;toop, for the roof was too low to per|mit him to walk upright. He advanced, and it became &s;till lower; but, after he had proceeded a few &s;teps on his hands and knees, it &s;uddenly widened, and he found him&s;elf in a &s;pacious and lofty part of the Cavern; though neither of its extent nor height could he form any accurate judg|ment, for its bounds were lo&s;t in impene|trable darkne&s;s. In that thick and ob&s;cure air, his torch ca&s;t no light but on the hand which bore it. Only when he climbed the &s;teep banks which overhung the &s;tream, the white foam of its waters enabled him to trace its cour&s;e, where it fell from a high rock in a broken cataract.</P>
<P>The deafning noi&s;e of the torrent filled the &s;oul of Sir Albert with an unknown horror: he de&s;cended precipitately from the bank, and retreated to a rock, which &s;eemed on one &s;ide the boundary of the
<PB N="98" REF="028401_0097_0FD8F429537B0F80">
Cavern; again&s;t which he leaned, while his imagination, unrelieved by any vi&s;ible object, and wholly occupied in the recol|lection of his dream, was left at liberty to repre&s;ent him, now, the hideous phantom hovering in the du&s;ky air, and now, the fle&s;hle&s;s warrior, &s;hunning his embrace, and waving high the fatal &s;word.</P>
<P>Sir Albert did not long give way to the&s;e vi&s;ionary fears, but &s;trove by reflec|tion to recal the firmne&s;s, which, at no mo|ment of real danger, ever had for&s;aken him. He was a&s;hamed of his weakne&s;s; and re|collecting that no circum&s;tance which could authori&s;e it had as yet occurred, he withdrew his arm from the rock, and would have proceeded to explore farther when he felt him&s;elf &s;uddenly drawn back; &mdash;his heart gave a fearful beat; he turned his head with perturbation, but &s;aw no|thing near him; he looked eagerly on all &s;ides, and at la&s;t, concluding his own ter|tors had deceived him, he would again have advanced from that &s;pot, when again he felt him&s;elf drawn back; and in&s;tantly a Form, to which even his fancy could a&s;&s;ign no certain &s;hape, flitted by him
<PB N="99" REF="028401_0098_0FD8F42A8F78C508">
through a cha&s;m in the rock, which the darkne&s;s had before prevented his ob&s;erv|ing, but which, when he approached it, opened to his view a long narrow pa&s;&s;age, leading downwards with a &s;teep de&s;cent, at the further extremity of which he de&s;|cried a &s;mall red flame; it re&s;embled the dog-&s;tar, when he &s;ets bloodily in a mi&s;ty horizon.</P>
<P>Sir Albert now &s;ummoned all his re&s;o|lution, and de&s;cended the path.&mdash;Hitherto, the ground on which he had trodden had been hard and rocky; but now, at every &s;tep his feet &s;unk into a loo&s;e dry &s;and. Guided by the flame, which grew larger and brighter as he advanced, he &s;oon reached a &s;mall and nearly circular vault, entirely illuminated by its radiance; and beyond this no further path appeared.</P>
<P>In this &s;pot, thus &s;upernaturally pointed out to him, Sir Albert was per&s;uaded he was to meet the conclu&s;ion of the adven|ture. He cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and implored the protection of the holy Angels; then, fix|ing his eyes on the flame, which hung in the air con&s;iderably above his head, he ob|&s;erved that it darted downwards, in a &s;piral ray, on a &s;pot where the &s;and ro&s;e

in a little hillock: and he heard around him a faint &s;ound, like the fluttering of di&s;tant pinions. He regarded the hillock, and ob&s;erved &s;omewhat glittering beneath the &s;urface: he &s;tooped, and removing a little of the &s;and, di&s;covered the blade of a &s;word; but what were his emotions, when he perceived that the hilt was gra&s;ped by the dry cold hand of a &s;keleton!</P>
<P>The words of the phantom who had vi|&s;ited him in his &s;leep, were in&s;tantly pre|&s;ent to his remembrance: and he dropped keeling on the earth.</P>
<P>"Yes, injured Spirit?" exclaimed he;
<Q>thou whom I know not by what name to addre&s;s, but who ha&s;t que&s;tionle&s;s led me hither, and art now invi&s;ibly pre&s;ent to my invocation! I receive thy gift! and I &s;wear to allow my&s;elf no re&s;t, till the vengeance &s;hall be completed, in which, though by what my&s;terious con|nexion as yet I comprehend not, thou ha&s;t taught me to believe my own de&s;|tiny involved!</Q></P>
<P>As he uttered the&s;e words, with an awe which half checked his voice, he extended his hand to take the &s;word; and in&s;tantly

at his touch, the bony fingers which held it, unclo&s;ed them&s;elves, and left it in his gra&s;p. At the &s;ame moment the flame, with a vivid fla&s;h, di&s;appeared; and a &s;ud|den whirlwind ari&s;ing extingui&s;hed the torch, and involved Sir Albert in an eddy of the &s;and.</P>
<P>His &s;oul, already worked up to the highe&s;t pitch of horror, now fainted with|in him; and he &s;unk on the ground, al|mo&s;t as lifele&s;s as the gha&s;tly form which lay be&s;ide him. He continued for &s;ome time devoid of all &s;en&s;ation; and, when his recollection returned to him, as he un|clo&s;ed his eyes in total darkne&s;s, he felt that his hand was laid on that of the &s;kele|ton.&mdash;He drew it back with ha&s;ty ter|ror.&mdash;He again made an effort to recover his fortitude; and, ri&s;ing, he li&s;tened to the ru&s;hing of the torrent, and hoped, by following that &s;ound, to find the pa&s;&s;age between the rocks by which he had enter|ed that rece&s;s. But &s;uddenly it was ren|dered vi&s;ible to him by a light which &s;treamed through it from the outer part of the Cavern. He approached, and perceiv|ed &s;everal lights moving in different direc|tions

acro&s;s the further entrance; and he imagined he heard the &s;teps of feet, and the cla&s;h of arms; when, in an in&s;tant, a cry of horror, uttered by many united voices, a&s;&s;ailed his ear; and amid the in|articulate &s;hrieks of &s;ome, he could di&s;tin|gui&s;h that others, exclaimed,
<Q>blood! a cataract of blood.</Q></P>
<P>The Cavern now &s;hook from its foun|dations, and the voices were at once lo&s;t in a cra&s;h, which &s;eemed as if the whole frame of Nature were violently rent a&s;un|der. The &s;ound was reverberated from the hollow &s;ides of the Cavern in repeated echos, which by degrees died away, and again no noi&s;e was heard, be&s;ide the ru&s;h|ing of the torrent.</P>
<P>The lights had di&s;appeared, yet &s;till a faint glimmering remained, which enabled Sir Albert to di&s;cern the pa&s;&s;age. Still gra&s;ping the fatal &s;word, he now re|a&s;cended his former path, and, on i&s;&s;uing out into the open part of the Cavern, he perceived that the glimmering he had ob|&s;erved was that of a torch, which lay un|extingui&s;hed on the ground. Rejoiced to recover a light, he took it up, and &s;oon

di&s;covered that the violent noi&s;e he had heard, had been occa&s;ioned by the fall of a huge fragment of the rock, under which, on a further examination, he perceived the mangled bodies of two men, whom its enormous weight had cru&s;hed.&mdash;Struck with new horror, he was regarding the&s;e wretched victims, when he heard behind him a deep and agonizing groan.&mdash;He &s;tarted!&mdash;and after &s;ome interval, it was repeated.&mdash;He turned, and looking round, he at la&s;t de&s;cried an armed figure, lying pro&s;trate on the earth.&mdash;As he approached him, this unknown per&s;on groaned again.</P>
<P>"Who art thou?" cried Sir Albert, bending over to regard him;
<Q>and what purpo&s;e led thee hither?</Q></P>
<P>The &s;tranger, at the &s;ound of a human voice, half rai&s;ed his head, and di&s;covered to Sir Albert the features of the Baron of Dornheim?&mdash;A&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;carcely cre|diting his eyes, he &s;tood for a moment &s;ilent; while the Baron, on beholding, him, &s;hrunk agha&s;t! and again turning his face to the earth, lifted up his arm, as if to &s;hroud him&s;elf from the view of &s;ome terrific object.</P>

<P>Sir Albert, acco&s;ting him by his name, demanded to whom he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and what had thus &s;trangely agitated him; but to all his que&s;tions he returned &s;uch di&s;ordered an&s;wers, as induced the Knight to believe that di&s;traction had &s;eized him. At la&s;t the Baron, with a &s;udden &s;tart, a|gain rai&s;ed his head, and leaning on his arm, regarded Sir Albert with a fixed horror.</P>
<P>"Why do you thus wildly gaze one me?" cried the Knight; "do you not know me?"</P>
<P>"Know thee!" exclaimed the Baron;
<Q>Ah! too well I know thee!&mdash;And that &s;word? The moment threatened by the Phantom is arrived, and already is my family extingui&s;hed on the earth!</Q></P>

<Q>Rodolph, Baron of Dornheim, was thy Father. He was my Brother&mdash;my elder Brother; and from the Holy Land was he returning, to claim the inheri|tance which, at the death of our com|mon parent, devolved of right to him, when I, covetous to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, met him in this Fore&s;t, with a band of ruffians devoted to my intere&s;t. He was alone; but, with his native valour, and with that Sword, which had often drank deeply of the blood of Infidels, he long defended him&s;elf again&s;t his a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins. At la&s;t, overpowered by numbers, he fell; and, in the convul&s;ions of death, he &s;o &s;trongly gra&s;ped the hilt, that one of my men, unable to force it from him, was about to &s;trike off the hand which held it, when I forbade him. To none of the brave Knights who had warred in Pale&s;tine was the Sword of Rodolph unknown; and, &s;hould it be found in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or in that of any of my people, a di&s;covery that he had peri&s;hed by our hands might have en&s;ued:&mdash;I therefore commanded them to forego the rich &s;poil, and to

&s;eized her&s;elf and Elinor, and had borne them to the Ca&s;tle, which they had reach|ed about an hour before; during which in|terval &s;he had abandoned her&s;elf to the bit|tere&s;t grief, and had ince&s;&s;antly wept the in|evitable death of the imaginary Sir Albert.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances afforded the pious Knight new cau&s;e to admire the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of Providence, which had thus ren|dered the meditated crimes of the victims of its ju&s;tice the means of bringing down its judgments on their heads; and he could not but feel &s;ome &s;atisfaction, that his enemies had thus been the in&s;truments of their own de&s;truction; &s;ince he was now &s;pared the ta&s;k of avenging his murdered Father on one &s;o nearly allied to him as the Baron, and of di&s;puting his claim to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, with one with whom he had lived on &s;uch habits of intimacy as with Lord Frederic, till the impious pro|po&s;al he had made him in the Fore&s;t had di&s;covered to him the blackne&s;s of his &s;oul. The Lady Con&s;tance heard with tran&s;port, of the change which that night had effected in the fortunes of her Lover.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="028401_0118_0FD8F468DBDC4F18">The morning now began to dawn; and Sir Albert immediately di&s;patched a me&s;|&s;enger to her Father, to inform him of the death of the late Baron, and his own &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, in right of his Father, Lord Ro|dolph&mdash;to acquaint him that his Daugh|ter was at the Ca&s;tle; and to invite him thither, to learn &s;uch further particulars as it was expedient he &s;hould know.</P>
<P>The invitation was immediately com|plied with; nor was Sir Albert deceived in his hope, that he who had been about, from motives of intere&s;t, to &s;acrifice his only child to a man &s;o unworthy to po&s;|&s;e&s;s her, would, with equal readine&s;s, con|&s;ent to be&s;tow her on him&s;elf, who now enjoyed the power and dignities of his late rival. His propo&s;als were received with manife&s;t joy; and, till the marriage could be celebrated with proper magnificence, the Lady Con&s;tance returned with her Father to the Ca&s;tle of Hertzwald, where during that interval, Sir Albert, now uni|ver&s;ally acknowledged Baron of Dorn|heim, daily vi&s;ited her.</P>
<P>He cau&s;ed the bodies of the late u&s;urp|er and his Son to be privately interred:
<PB N="120" REF="028401_0119_0FD8F46BC67B83F0">
but the remains of his unhappy father, him&s;elf, at the head of a large body of his va&s;&s;als, re-entered the <HI>Cavern of Death</HI> to bring forth; and mourning his untimely fate with the deepe&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of filial &s;orrow, he cau&s;ed them to be depo&s;ited, with the mo&s;t &s;olemn rites of the Church, and every funeral honour, in the Chapel of the Ca&s;tle: erecting over them a magnifi|cent tomb, above which was &s;u&s;pended the fatal Sword.</P>
<P>Shortly after, he e&s;pou&s;ed the Lady Con|&s;tance; and in the hand of her who had been the object of his earlie&s;t affections, he received the completion of that felicity to which his virtues entitled him.</P>
