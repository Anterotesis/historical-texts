<P>IN the following Ob&s;ervations. I have taken that liberty of examining public mea&s;ures, which, happily for this kingdom, every per&s;on in it enjoys. They contain the &s;entiments of a private and unconnected man; for which, &s;hould there be any thing wrong in them, he alone is an&s;werable.</P>
<P>After all that has been written on the di&s;|pute with <HI>America,</HI> no reader can expect to be informed, in this publication, of much that he has not before known. Perhaps, however, he may find in it &s;ome new matter; and if he &s;hould, it will be chiefly in the Ob&s;ervations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, and the Policy of the War with America; and in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR Colonies in NORTH America appear to be now determined to do and &s;uffer every thing, under the per&s;ua&s;ion, that GREAT BRITAIN is attempting to rob them of that Liberty to which every member of &s;ociety, and all civil communities, have a natural and unalienable right. The que&s;tion, therefore, whether this is a rea&s;onable per&s;ua&s;ion, is highly intere&s;ting, and de&s;erves the mo&s;t careful attention of every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> who values Liberty, and wi&s;hes to avoid &s;taining him&s;elf with the guilt of invading it. But it is impo&s;&s;ible to judge properly of this que&s;tion without correct ideas of Liberty <HI>in general</HI>; and of the nature, limits, and principles of Civil Liberty <HI>in parti|cular.</HI>&mdash;The following ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject appear to me important, as well as ju&s;t; and I cannot make my&s;elf ea&s;y without offering them to the public at the pre&s;ent period, big with events of the la&s;t con&s;equence to this kingdom. I do this with reluctance and pain, urged by &s;trong feelings, but at the &s;ame time checked by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I am likely to deliver &s;entiments not favourable to the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures of that government, under which I live, and to which I am a con&s;tant and zealous well-wi&s;her. Such, however, are my pre&s;ent &s;entiments and views, that this is a con&s;idera|tion of inferior moment with me; and, as I hope never to go beyond the bounds of decent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and expo&s;tulation, I flatter my&s;elf, that I &s;hall be able to avoid giving any per&s;on ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations with which I &s;hall begin, are of a more general and ab&s;tracted nature; but being, in my opinion, of particular con&s;equence; and nece&s;&s;ary to introduce what I have principally in view, I hope they will be patiently read and con&s;idered.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the Nature of Liberty in General.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to obtain a more di&s;tinct and accurate view of the nature of Liberty as &s;uch, it will be u&s;eful to con&s;ider it under the four following general divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Phy&s;ical</HI> Liberty.&mdash;Secondly, <HI>Moral</HI> Liberty.&mdash; Thirdly, <HI>Religious</HI> Liberty.&mdash;And Fourthly, <HI>Civil</HI> Liberty. &mdash;The&s;e heads comprehend under them all the different kinds of Liberty. And I have placed <HI>Civil</HI> Liberty la&s;t, be|cau&s;e I mean to apply to it all I &s;hall &s;ay of the other kinds of Liberty.</P>
<P>By PHYSICAL LIBERTY I mean that principle of <HI>Sponta|neity,</HI> or <HI>Self-determination,</HI> which con&s;titutes us <HI>Agents</HI>; or which gives us a command over our actions, rendering them properly <HI>ours,</HI> and not effects of the operation of any foreign cau&s;e.&mdash;MORAL LIBERTY is the power of following, in all circum&s;tances, our &s;en&s;e of right and wrong; or of acting in conformity to our reflecting and moral principles, without being controuled by any contrary principles.&mdash;RELIGIOUS LIBERTY &s;ignifies the power of exerci&s;ing, without mo|le&s;tation, that mode of religion which we think be&s;t; or of making the deci&s;ions of our own con&s;ciences, re&s;pecting religious truth, the rule of our conduct, and not any of the deci&s;ions of others.&mdash;In like manner, CIVIL LIBERTY is the power of a <HI>Civil Society</HI> or <HI>State</HI> to govern it&s;elf by its own di&s;cretion; or by laws of its own making, without being &s;ub|ject to any foreign di&s;cretion, or to the impo&s;itions of any extraneous will or power.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that, according to the&s;e definitions of the different kinds of liberty, there is one general idea, that runs through them all; I mean, the idea of <HI>Self-direction,</HI> or <HI>Self government.</HI>&mdash;Did our volitions originate not with <HI>our|&s;elves,</HI> but with &s;ome cau&s;e over which we have no power; or were we under a nece&s;&s;ity of always following &s;ome will diffe|rent from our own, we &s;hould want PHYSICAL LIBERTY.</P>
<P>In like manner; he who&s;e perceptions of moral obligation are controuled by his pa&s;&s;ions has lo&s;t his <HI>Moral Liberty</HI>; and the mo&s;t common language applied to him is, that he wants <HI>Self-government.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="015032_0005_0F95506836FEB858">He likewi&s;e who, in religion, cannot govern him&s;elf by his convictions of religious duty, but is obliged to receive for|mularies of faith, and to practi&s;e modes of wor&s;hip impo&s;ed upon him by others, wants <HI>Religious Liberty.</HI>&mdash;And the Community al&s;o that is governed, not by it&s;elf, but by &s;ome will independent of it, and over which it has no controul, wants <HI>Civil Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>In all the&s;e ca&s;es there is a force which &s;tands oppo&s;ed to the agent's <HI>own</HI> will; and which, as far as it operates, produces <HI>Servitude.</HI>&mdash;In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, this force is incompatible with the very idea of voluntary motion; and the &s;ubject of it is a mere pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument which never <HI>acts,</HI> but is always <HI>acted upon.</HI>&mdash;In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> ca&s;e; this force is the influence of pa&s;&s;ion getting the better of rea&s;on; or the <HI>brute</HI> overpowering and conquering the will of the <HI>man.</HI>&mdash;In the <HI>third</HI> ca&s;e; it is <HI>Human Authority</HI> in religion requiring conformity to parti|cular modes of faith and wor&s;hip, and &s;uper&s;eding <HI>private judgment.</HI>&mdash;And in the la&s;t ca&s;e, it is any will di&s;tinct from that of the Majority of a Community, which claims a power of making laws for it, and di&s;po&s;ing of its property.</P>
<P>This it is, I think, that marks the limit, or that lays the line between <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Slavery.</HI> As far as, in any in&s;tance, the operation of any cau&s;e comes in to re&s;train the power of Self-government, &s;o far Slavery is introduced: Nor do I think that a preci&s;er idea than this of Liberty and Slavery can be formed.</P>
<P>I cannot help wi&s;hing I could here fix my reader's attention, and engage him to con&s;ider carefully the dignity of that ble&s;&s;ing to which we give the name of LIBERTY, according to the repre|&s;entation now made of it. There is not a word in the whole compa&s;s of language which expre&s;&s;es &s;o much of what is im|portant and excellent. It is, in every view of it, a ble&s;&s;ing truly &s;acred and invaluable.&mdash;Without <HI>Phy&s;ical Liberty,</HI> man would be a machine acted upon by mechanical &s;prings, having no principle of motion in him&s;elf or command over events; and, therefore incapable of all merit and demerit.&mdash;With|out <HI>Moral Liberty</HI> he is a wicked and dete&s;table being, &s;ubject to the tyranny of ba&s;e lu&s;ts, and the &s;port of every vile appetite. &mdash;And without <HI>Religious</HI> and <HI>Civil Liberty</HI> he is a poor and abject animal, without rights, without property, and without a con&s;cience, bending his neck to the yoke, and crouching to the will of every &s;illy creature who has the in&s;olence to pretend to authority over him.&mdash;Nothing, therefore, can be of &s;o much

con&s;equence to us as <HI>Liberty.</HI> It is the foundation of all honour, and the chief privilege and glory of our natures.</P>
<P>In fixing our ideas on the &s;ubject of Liberty it is of parti|cular u&s;e to take &s;uch an enlarged view of it as I have now given. But the immediate object of the pre&s;ent enquiry being <HI>Civil Liberty,</HI> I will confine to it all the &s;ub&s;equent ob&s;ervations.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. Of Civil Liberty and the Principles of Government.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, it is obvious, that all civil go|vernment, as far as it can be denominated <HI>free,</HI> is the creature of the people. It originates with them. It is con|ducted under their direction; and has in view nothing but their happine&s;s. All its different forms are no more than &s;o many different modes in which they chu&s;e to direct their affairs, and to &s;ecure the quiet enjoyment of their rights.&mdash; In every free &s;tate every man is his own legi&s;lator.&mdash;All <HI>taxes</HI> are free gifts for public &s;ervices.&mdash;All <HI>laws</HI> are particular pro|vi&s;ions or regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed by COMMON CONSENT for gaining protection and &s;afety.&mdash;And all <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> are Tru&s;tees or Deputies for carrying the&s;e regulations into execution.</P>
<P>Liberty, therefore, is too imperfectly defined when it is &s;aid to be "a Government by LAWS, and not by MEN." If the laws are made by one man, or a junto of men in a &s;tate, and not by COMMON CONSENT, a government by them does not differ from Slavery. In this ca&s;e it would be a contradiction in terms to &s;ay that the &s;tate governs it&s;elf.</P>
<P>From hence it is obvious that <HI>Civil Liberty,</HI> in its mo&s;t per|fect degree, can be enjoyed only in &s;mall &s;tates, where every member is capable of giving his &s;uffrage in per&s;on, and of being cho&s;en into public offices. When a &s;tate becomes &s;o numerous, or when the different parts of it are removed to &s;uch di&s;tances from one another, as to render this impracticable, a diminution of Liberty nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es. There are, however, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, methods by which &s;uch near approaches may be made to perfect Liberty as &s;hall an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of government, and at the &s;ame time &s;ecure every right of human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="015032_0007_0F9550690142FB98">Tho' all the members of a &s;tate &s;hould not be capable of giving their &s;uffrages on public mea&s;ures, <HI>individually</HI> and <HI>per|&s;onally,</HI> they may do this by the appointment of <HI>Sub&s;titutes</HI> or <HI>Repre&s;entatives.</HI> They may entru&s;t the powers of legi&s;lation, &s;ubject to &s;uch re&s;trictions as they &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary, with any number of <HI>Delegates</HI>; and whatever can be done by &s;uch delegates, within the limits of their tru&s;t, may be con&s;idered as done by the united voice and coun&s;el of the community.&mdash; In this method a free government may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in a large &s;tate; and it is conceiveable that by regulations of this kind, any number of &s;tates might be &s;ubjected to a &s;cheme of go|vernment, that would exclude the de&s;olations of war, and produce univer&s;al peace and order.</P>
<P>Let us think here of what may be practicable in this way with re&s;pect to <HI>Europe</HI> in particular.&mdash; While it continues divided, as it is at pre&s;ent, into a great number of independent kingdoms, who&s;e intere&s;ts are continually cla&s;hing, it is im|po&s;&s;ible but that di&s;putes will often ari&s;e which mu&s;t end in war and carnage. It would be no remedy to this evil to make one of the&s;e &s;tates &s;upreme over the re&s;t; and to give it an ab&s;olute plenitude of power to &s;uperintend and controul them. This would be to &s;ubject all the &s;tates to the arbitrary di&s;cretion of one, and to e&s;tabli&s;h an ignominious &s;lavery not po&s;&s;ible to be long endured. It would, therefore, be a remedy wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e; nor is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be approved by any mind that has not lo&s;t every idea of Civil Liberty. On the contrary.&mdash;Let every &s;tate, with re&s;pect to all its internal concerns, be continued independent of all the re&s;t; and let a ge|neral confederacy be formed by the appointment of a SENATE con&s;i&s;ting of Repre&s;entatives from all the different &s;tates. Let this SENATE po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of managing all the <HI>common</HI> concerns of the united &s;tates, and of judging and deciding between them, as a common <HI>Arbiter</HI> or <HI>Umpire,</HI> in all di&s;putes; having, at the &s;ame time, under its direction, the common force of the &s;tates to &s;upport its deci&s;ions.&mdash;In the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, each &s;eparate &s;tate would be &s;ecure again&s;t the interference of foreign power in its private concerns, and, therefore, would po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>Liberty</HI>; and at the &s;ame time it would be &s;ecure again&s;t all oppre&s;&s;ion and in&s;ult from every neighbour|ing &s;tate.&mdash;Thus might the &s;cattered force and abilities of a whole continent be gathered into one point; all litigations &s;ettled as they ro&s;e; univer&s;al peace pre&s;erved; and nation prevented <HI>from any more lifting up a &s;word again&s;t nation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="015032_0008_0F955075C4471F90">I have ob&s;erved, that though, in a great &s;tate, all the indivi|duals that compo&s;e it cannot be admitted to an immediate participation in the powers of legi&s;lation and government, yet they may participate in the&s;e powers by a delegation of them to a body of repre&s;entatives.&mdash;In this ca&s;e it is evident that the &s;tate will be &s;till <HI>free</HI> or <HI>&s;elf-governed</HI>; and that it will be more or le&s;s &s;o in proportion as it is more or le&s;s fairly and adequately repre&s;ented. If the per&s;ons to whom the tru&s;t of government is committed hold their places for &s;hort terms; if they are cho&s;en by the unbia&s;&s;ed voices of a majority of the &s;tate, and &s;ubject to their in&s;tructions; Liberty will be en|joyed in its highe&s;t degree. But if they are cho&s;en for long terms by a part only of the &s;tate; and if during that term they are &s;ubject to no controul from their con&s;tituents; the very idea of Liberty will be lo&s;t, and the power of chu&s;ing con&s;tituents becomes nothing but a power, lodged in a <HI>few,</HI> to chu&s;e, at certain periods, a body of <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> for them&s;elves and for the re&s;t of the Community. And if a &s;tate is &s;o &s;unk that the body of its repre&s;entatives are elected by a handful of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of near &s;ix <HI>millions</HI> of inhabitants, 5723 per&s;ons, mo&s;t of them the lowe&s;t of the people, elect one half of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI>; and 364 votes chu&s;e a ninth part. This may be &s;een di&s;tinctly made out in the <HI>Political Di&s;qui&s;itions,</HI> Vol. I. Book 2. C. 4. a work full of important and u&s;eful in&s;truction.</NOTE> meane&s;t per&s;ons in it, who&s;e votes are always paid for; and if al&s;o, there is a higher will on which even the&s;e mock repre&s;entatives them&s;elves depend, and that directs their voices: In the&s;e circum&s;tances, it will be an abu&s;e of language to &s;ay that the &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es Liberty. Private men, indeed, might be allowed the exerci&s;e of Liberty; as they might al&s;o under the mo&s;t de&s;potic government; but it would be an <HI>indulgence</HI> or <HI>connivance</HI> derived from the &s;pirit of the times, or from an accidental mildne&s;s in the admini&s;tration. And, rather than be governed in &s;uch a manner, it would perhaps be better to be governed by the will of one man without any repre&s;entation: For a repre&s;entation &s;o degenerated could an&s;wer no other end than to mi&s;lead and deceive, by di&s;gui&s;ing &s;lavery, and keeping up a <HI>form</HI> of Liberty when the <HI>reality</HI> was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Within the limits now mentioned, Liberty may be enjoyed in every po&s;&s;ible degree; from that which is complete and perfect, to that whch is merely nominal; according as the people have more or le&s;s of a &s;hare in government, and of a controuling power over the per&s;ons by whom it is admini&s;tered.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="015032_0009_0F955069CEB6E438">In general, to be <HI>free</HI> is to be guided by one's own will; and to be guided by the will of another is the characteri&s;tic of <HI>Servitude.</HI> This is particularly applicable to Political Liberty. That &s;tate, I have ob&s;erved, is <HI>free,</HI> which is guided by its own will; or, (which comes to the &s;ame) by the will of an a&s;&s;embly of repre&s;entatives appointed by it&s;elf and ac|countable to it&s;elf. And every &s;tate that is not &s;o governed; or in which a body of men repre&s;enting the people make not an e&s;&s;ential part of the Legi&s;lature, is in <HI>&s;lavery.</HI>&mdash;In order to form the mo&s;t perfect con&s;titution of government, there may be the be&s;t rea&s;ons for joining to &s;uch a body of repre&s;en|tatives, an <HI>Hereditary Council,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of men of the fir&s;t rank in the &s;tate, with a <HI>Supreme executive Magi&s;trate</HI> at the head of all. This will form u&s;eful checks in a legi&s;lature; and contribute to give it vigour, union, and di&s;patch, with|out infringing liberty: for, as long as that part of a govern|ment which repre&s;ents the people is a <HI>fair repre&s;entation</HI>; and al&s;o has a negative on all public mea&s;ures, together with the &s;ole power of impo&s;ing taxes and originating &s;upplies; the e&s;&s;entials of liberty will be pre&s;erved.&mdash;We make it our boa&s;t in this country, that this is our own con&s;titution. I will not &s;ay with how much rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Of &s;uch Liberty as I have now de&s;cribed, it is impo&s;&s;ible that there &s;hould be an exce&s;s. Government is an in&s;titution for the benefit of the people governed, which they have power to model as they plea&s;e; and to &s;ay, that they can have too much of this power is to &s;ay, that there ought to be a power in the &s;tate &s;uperior to that which gives it being, and from which all juri&s;diction in it is derived.&mdash;Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which has been commonly mentioned, as an extreme of liberty, is indeed its oppo&s;ite. It is government by the will of rapacious individuals, in oppo&s;ition to the will of the com|munity, made known and declared in the laws. A free &s;tate, at the &s;ame time that it is free it&s;elf, makes all its mem|bers free by excluding licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and guarding their per&s;ons and property and good name again&s;t in&s;ult. It is the end of all ju&s;t government, at the &s;ame time that it &s;ecures the liberty of the public again&s;t <HI>foreign</HI> injury, to &s;ecure the liberty of the individual again&s;t <HI>private</HI> injury. I do not, therefore, think it &s;trictly ju&s;t to &s;ay, that it belongs to the nature of government to entrench on private liberty. It ought never to do this, except as far as the exerci&s;e of private liberty
<PB N="10" REF="015032_0010_0F9550768E4949A0">
encroaches on the liberties of others. That is, it is licentiou&s;ne&s;s it re&s;trains, and liberty it&s;elf only when u&s;ed to de&s;troy liberty.</P>
<P>It appears from hence, that licentiou&s;ne&s;s and de&s;poti&s;m are more nearly allied than is commonly imagined. They are both alike incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, and the true end of government; nor is there any other difference between them, than that the one is the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>great</HI> men, and the other the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>little</HI> men; or that, by the one, the per&s;ons and property of a people are &s;ubject to outrage and inva&s;ion from a King, or a lawle&s;s body of <HI>Grandees</HI>; and that, by the other, they are &s;ubject to the like outrage from a <HI>lawle&s;s mob.</HI>&mdash;In avoiding one of the&s;e evils, mankind have often run into the other. But all well-con&s;tituted governments guard equally again&s;t both. Indeed of the two, the la&s;t is, on &s;everal accounts, the lea&s;t to be dreaded, and has done the lea&s;t mi&s;chief. It may be truly &s;aid, that if licentiou&s;ne&s;s has de&s;troyed its thou&s;ands, de&s;poti&s;m has de|&s;troyed its millions. The former, having little power, and no &s;y&s;tem to &s;upport it, nece&s;&s;arily finds its own remedy; and a people &s;oon get out of the tumult and anarchy attending it. But a de&s;poti&s;m, wearing the form of government, and being armed with its force, is an evil not to be conquered without dreadful &s;truggles. It goes on from age to age, de|ba&s;ing the human faculties, levelling all di&s;tinctions, and preying on the rights and ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety.&mdash;It de&s;erves to be added, that in a &s;tate di&s;turbed by licentiou&s;ne&s;s, there is an animation which is favourable to the human mind, and which puts it upon exerting its powers. But in a &s;tate habi|tuated to a de&s;poti&s;m, all is &s;till and torpid. A dark and &s;avage tyranny &s;tifles every effort of genius; and the mind lo&s;es all its &s;pirit and dignity.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to what I have farther in view, I will ob&s;erve, that the account now given of the principles of public Liberty, and the nature of an equal and free government, &s;hews what judgment we &s;hould form of that OMNIPOTENCE, which, it has been &s;aid, mu&s;t belong to every government as &s;uch. Great &s;tre&s;s has been laid on this, but mo&s;t unrea&s;ona|bly. &mdash;Government, as has been before ob&s;erved is, in the very nature of it, a TRUST; and all its powers a DELEGA|TION for gaining particular ends.

rights which it ought to protect.&mdash;A PARLIAMENT, for in&s;tance, con&s;i&s;ting of a body of repre&s;entatives cho&s;en for a limited period, to make laws, and to grant money for public &s;ervices, would forfeit its authority by making it&s;elf perpetual, or even prolonging its own duration; by nominating its own members; by accepting bribes; or &s;ubjecting it&s;elf to any kind of foreign influence. This would convert a <HI>Parliament</HI> into a <HI>conclave</HI> or <HI>junto</HI> of &s;elf-created tools; and a &s;tate that has lo&s;t its regard to its own rights, &s;o far as to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a breach of tru&s;t in its rulers, is en&s;laved.&mdash;Nothing, there|fore, can be more ab&s;urd than the doctrine which &s;ome have taught, with re&s;pect to the omnipotence of parliaments. They po&s;&s;e&s;s no power beyond the limits of the tru&s;t for the execution of which they were formed. If they contradict this tru&s;t, they betray their con&s;tituents, and di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves. All delegated power mu&s;t be &s;ubordinate and limited.&mdash;If omnipotence can, with any &s;en&s;e, be a&s;cribed to a legi&s;lature, it mu&s;t be lodged where all legi&s;lative authority originates; that is, in the PEOPLE. For <HI>their</HI> &s;akes government is in&s;tituted; and their's is the only real omnipotence.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that all I have been &s;aying would be very ab&s;urd, were the opinions ju&s;t which &s;ome have maintained concerning the origin of government. According to the&s;e opinions, government is not the creature of the people, or the re&s;ult of a convention between them and their rulers: But there are certain men who po&s;&s;e&s;s in them&s;elves, indepen|dently of the will of the people, a right of governing them, which they derive from the Deity. This doctrine has been abundantly refuted by many <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See among others Mr. Locke on Government, and Mr. Prie&s;tley's E&s;&s;ay on the fir&s;t Principles of Government.</NOTE> excellent writers. It is a doc|trine which avowedly &s;ubverts Civil Liberty; and which repre&s;ents mankind as a body of va&s;&s;als, formed to de&s;cend like cattle from one &s;et of owners to another, who have an ab&s;olute dominion over them. It is a wonder, that tho&s;e who view their &s;pecies in a light &s;o humiliating, &s;hould ever be able to think of them&s;elves without regret and &s;hame. The inten|tion of the&s;e ob&s;ervations is not to oppo&s;e &s;uch &s;entiments; but, taking for granted the rea&s;onablene&s;s of Civil Liberty, to &s;hew wherein it con&s;i&s;ts, and what di&s;tingui&s;hes it from its contrary.&mdash;And in con&s;idering this &s;ubject, as it has been now treated, it is unavoidable to reflect on the excellency of a free government, and its tendency to exalt the nature of

Liberty is the &s;oil where the arts and &s;ciences have flouri&s;hed; and the more free a &s;tate has been, the more have the powers of the human mind been drawn forth into action, and the greater number of brave men has it produced.

<P>The&s;e are reflections which &s;hould be con&s;tantly pre&s;ent to every mind in this country.&mdash;As <HI>Moral</HI> Liberty is the prime ble&s;&s;ing of man in his <HI>private</HI> capacity, &s;o is <HI>Civil</HI> Liberty in his <HI>public</HI> capacity.

<P>The people of this kingdom were once warmed by &s;uch &s;entiments as tho&s;e. Many a &s;ycophant of power have they &s;acrificed. Often have they fought and bled in the cau&s;e of Liberty.

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the Authority of one Country over another.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the nature and principles of Civil Liberty, as they have been now explained, it is an immediate and nece&s;&s;ary inference that no one community can have any power over the property or legi&s;lation of another community, that is not incorporated with it by a ju&s;t and adequate repre&s;entation.&mdash; Then only, it has been &s;hewn, is a State <HI>free,</HI> when it is governed by its own will. But a country that is &s;ubject to the legi&s;lature of another country, in which it has no voice, and over which it has no controul, cannot be &s;aid to be governed by its own will. Such a country therefore, is in a &s;tate of &s;lavery. And it de&s;erves to be particularly con&s;idered, that &s;uch a &s;lavery is wor&s;e, on &s;everal accounts, than any &s;lavery of private men to one another, or of kingdoms to de&s;pots within them&s;elves.&mdash;Between one &s;tate and another, there is none of that fellow-feeling that takes place between per&s;ons in private life. Being detached bodies that never &s;ee one another, and re&s;iding perhaps in different quarters of the globe, the &s;tate that governs cannot be a witne&s;s to the &s;ufferings occa&s;ioned by its oppre&s;&s;ions; or a competent judge of the circum&s;tances and abilities of the people who are go|verned. They mu&s;t al&s;o have in a great degree &s;eparate intere&s;ts; and the more the one is loaded, the more the other may be ea&s;ed. The infamy likewi&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, being in &s;uch circum&s;tances &s;hared among a multitude, is not likely to be much felt or regarded. &mdash; On all the&s;e accounts there is, in the ca&s;e of one country &s;ubjugated to another, little or nothing to check rapacity; and the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice and cruelty may be practi&s;ed without remor&s;e or pity.&mdash;I will add, that it is particularly difficult to &s;hake off a tyranny of this kind. A &s;ingle de&s;pot, if the people are unanimous and re&s;olute, may be &s;oon &s;ubdued. But a de&s;potic &s;tate is not ea&s;ily &s;ubdued; and a people &s;ubject to it cannot emancipate them&s;elves without entering into a dreadful, and, perhaps, very unequal conte&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving farther, that the &s;lavery of a people to internal de&s;pots may be qualified and limited; but I don't &s;ee what can limit the authority of one &s;tate over another. The exerci&s;e of power in this ca&s;e can have no other mea&s;ure than di&s;cretion; and, therefore, mu&s;t be indefinite and ab&s;olute.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="015032_0014_0F95507806CFDDB0">Once more. It &s;hould be con&s;idered that the government of one country by another, can only be &s;upported by a military force; and, without &s;uch a &s;upport, mu&s;t be de&s;titute of all weight and efficacy.</P>
<P>This will be be&s;t explained by putting the following ca&s;e. &mdash;There is, let us &s;uppo&s;e, in a province &s;ubject to the &s;overeignty of a di&s;tant &s;tate, a &s;ubordinate legi&s;lature, con&s;i&s;t|ing of an A&s;&s;embly cho&s;en by the people; a Council cho&s;en by that A&s;&s;embly; and a Governor <HI>appointed</HI> by the Sovereign State, and paid by the Province. There are, likewi&s;e, judges and other officers, appointed and paid in the &s;ame manner, for admini&s;tering <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> agreeably to the laws, by the verdicts of juries fairly and indi&s;criminately cho&s;en.&mdash;This forms a con&s;titution &s;eemingly free, by giving the people a &s;hare in their own government, and &s;ome check on their rulers. But, while there is a higher legi&s;lative power, to the controul of which &s;uch a con&s;titution is &s;ubject, it does not it&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;s Liberty, and therefore, cannot be of any u&s;e as a &s;ecurity to Liberty; nor is it po&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be of long duration. Laws offen&s;ive to the Province will be enacted by the Sovereign State. The legi&s;|lature of the Province will remon&s;trate again&s;t them. The ma|gi&s;trates will not execute them. Juries will not convict upon them; and con&s;equently, like the Pope's Bulls which once go|verned <HI>Europe,</HI> they will become nothing but forms and empty &s;ounds, to which no regard will be &s;hewn.&mdash;In order to re|medy this evil, and to give efficiency to its government, the &s;upreme &s;tate will naturally be led to withdraw the <HI>Governor,</HI> the <HI>Council,</HI> and the <HI>Judges</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The independency of the Judges we e&s;teem in this country one of our greate&s;t privileges.&mdash;Before the revolution they generally, I believe, held their places <HI>during plea&s;ure.</HI> King William gave them their places <HI>during good behaviour.</HI> At the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Royal Family their places were given them <HI>during good behaviour,</HI> in con&s;equence of the Act of Settlement, 12 and 13 W. III. c. 2. But an opinion having been entertained by &s;ome, that though their commi&s;&s;ions were made under the Act of Settlement to continue, during good behaviour, yet that they determined on the demi&s;e of the Crown; it was enacted by a &s;tatute made in the fir&s;t year of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">3.
<Q>That the com|mi&s;&s;ions of Judges for the time being &s;hall be, continue, and remain in full force, during their good behaviour, notwith&s;tanding the demi&s;e of his Maje&s;ty, or of any of his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors;</Q>
with a provi&s;o,
<Q>that it may be lawful for his Maje&s;ty, his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, to remove any Judge upon the addre&s;s of both Hou&s;es of Parliament.</Q>
And by the &s;ame Statute their &s;alaries are &s;ecured to them during the continuance of their commi&s;&s;ions: His Maje&s;ty, ac|cording to the preamble of the Statute, having been plea&s;ed to declare from the Throne to both Hou&s;es of Parliament,
<Q>That he looked upon the Independency and uprightou&s;ne&s;s of Judges, as e&s;&s;ential to the impartial admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, as one of the be&s;t &s;ecurities to the Rights and Liberties of his loving Subjects, and as mo&s;t conducive to the honour of his Crown.</Q></P>
<P>A worthy friend and able Lawyer has &s;upplied me with this note. It affords, when contra&s;ted with that <HI>dependence</HI> of the Judges which has been thought rea|&s;onable in <HI>America,</HI> a &s;ad &s;pecimen of the different manner in which a kingdom may think proper to govern it&s;elf, and the provinces &s;ubject to it.</P></NOTE> from the controul of the Province,
<PB N="15" REF="015032_0015_0F95506C01024530">
by making them entirely dependent on it&s;elf for their <HI>pay</HI> and <HI>continuance in office,</HI> as well as for their appointment. It will al&s;o alter the mode of chu&s;ing Juries on purpo&s;e to bring them more under its influence: And in &s;ome ca&s;es, under the pre|tence of the impo&s;&s;ibility of gaining an impartial trial where government is re&s;i&s;ted, it will perhaps ordain, that offenders &s;hall be removed from the Province to be tried within its own territories: And it may even go &s;o far in this kind of policy, as to endeavour to prevent the effects of di&s;contents, by forbidding all meetings and a&s;&s;ociations of the people, except at &s;uch times, and for &s;uch particular purpo&s;es, as &s;hall be permitted them.</P>
<P>Thus will &s;uch a Province be exactly in the &s;ame &s;tate that <HI>Britain</HI> would be in, were our fir&s;t executive Magi&s;trate, our Hou&s;e of Lords, and our Judges, nothing but the in&s;truments of a foreign democratical power; were our Juries nominated by that power; or were we liable to be tran&s;ported to a di&s;tant country to be tried for offences committed here; and re&s;trained from calling any meetings, con&s;ulting about any grievances, or a&s;&s;ociating for any purpo&s;es, except when leave &s;hould be given us by a <HI>Lord Lieutenant</HI> or <HI>Viceroy.</HI></P>
<P>It is certain that this is a &s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion which no country could endure, and to which it would be vain to expect that any people &s;hould &s;ubmit an hour without an armed force to compel them.</P>
<P>The late tran&s;actions in <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay</HI> are a perfect ex|emplification of what I have now &s;aid. The government of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in that Province has gone on exactly in the train I have de&s;cribed; till at la&s;t it became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tation troops there, not amenable to the civil power; and all termi|nated in a government by the SWORD. And &s;uch, if a people are not &s;unk below the character of men, will be the i&s;&s;ue of all governments in &s;imilar circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked&mdash;
<Q>Are there not cau&s;es by which one &s;tate may acquire a <HI>rightful</HI> authority over another, though not con&s;olidated by an adequate Repre&s;entation?</Q>
&mdash; I an&s;wer that there are no &s;uch cau&s;es.&mdash;All the cau&s;es to which &s;uch an effect <HI>can</HI> be a&s;cribed are CONQUEST, COM|PACT, or OBLIGATIONS CONFERRED.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="015032_0016_0F955078B79D80C8">Much has been &s;aid of the right of <HI>conque&s;t</HI>; and hi&s;tory contains little more than accounts of kingdoms reduced by it under the dominion of other kingdoms, and of the havock it has made among mankind.

<P>Neither can any &s;tate acquire &s;uch an authority over other &s;tates in virtue of any <HI>compacts</HI> or <HI>ce&s;&s;ions.</HI> This is a ca&s;e in which compacts are not binding. <HI>Civil</HI> Liberty is, in this re&s;pect, on the &s;ame footing with <HI>Religious</HI> Liberty.

Such a ce&s;&s;ion, being incon&s;i&s;tent with the un|alienable rights of human nature, would either not bind at all; or bind only the individuals who made it. This is a ble&s;&s;ing which no one generation of men can give up for another; and which, when lo&s;t, a people have always a right to re&s;ume.&mdash;Had our ance&s;tors in this country been &s;o mad as to have &s;ubjected them&s;elves to any foreign Community, we could not have been under any obligation to continue in &s;uch a &s;tate. And all the nations now in the world who, in con&s;equence of the tamene&s;s and folly of their predece&s;&s;ors, are &s;ubject to arbitrary power, have a right to emancipate them&s;elves as &s;oon as they can.</P>
<P>If neither <HI>conque&s;t</HI> nor <HI>compact</HI> can give &s;uch an authority, much le&s;s can any favours received, or any &s;ervices performed by one &s;tate for another.&mdash;Let the favour received be what it will, Liberty is too dear a price for it. A &s;tate that has been <HI>obliged</HI> is not, therefore, bound to be <HI>en&s;laved.</HI> It

ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to make an adequate return for the &s;ervices done to it; but to &s;uppo&s;e that it ought to give up the power of governing it&s;elf, and the di&s;po&s;al of its property, would be to &s;uppo&s;e, that, in order to &s;hew its gratitude, it ought to part with the power of ever afterwards exerci&s;ing gratitude.&mdash; How much has been done by this kingdom for <HI>Hanover?</HI> But no one will &s;ay that on this account, we have a right to make the laws of <HI>Hanover</HI>; or even to draw a &s;ingle penny from it without its own con&s;ent.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid it will, I am afraid, be trifling to apply the preceding arguments to the ca&s;e of different com|munities, which are con&s;idered a different parts of the &s;ame <HI>Empire.</HI> But there are rea&s;ons which render it nece&s;&s;ary for me to be explicit in making this application.</P>
<P>What I mean here is ju&s;t to point out the difference of &s;itu|ation between communities forming and <HI>Empire</HI>; and particu|lar bodies or cla&s;&s;es of men forming different parts of a <HI>King|dom.</HI> Different communities forming an <HI>Empire</HI> have no con|nexions, which produce a nece&s;&s;ary reciprocation of intere&s;ts between them. They inhabit different di&s;tricts, and are go|verned by different legi&s;latures.&mdash;On the contrary. The dif|ferent cla&s;&s;es of men <HI>within a kingdom</HI> are all placed on the &s;ame ground. Their concerns and intere&s;ts are the &s;ame; and what is done to one part mu&s;t affect all&mdash;The&s;e are &s;itua|tions totally different; and a con&s;titution of government that may be con&s;i&s;tent with Liberty in one of them, may be entirely incon&s;i&s;tent with it in the other. It is, however, certain that, even in the la&s;t of the&s;e &s;ituations, no one part ought to govern the re&s;t. In order to a fair and equal government, there ought to be a fair and equal repre&s;entation of all that are governed; and as far as this is wanting in any government, it deviates from the principles of Liberty, and becomes unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive.&mdash;But in the circum&s;tances of different com|munities, all this holds with un&s;peakably more force. The government of a part in this ca&s;e becomes complete tyranny, and &s;ubjection to it becomes complete &s;lavery.</P>
<P>But ought there not, it is a&s;ked, to exi&s;t &s;omewhere in an <HI>Empire</HI> a &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority over the whole; or a power to controul and bind all the different &s;tates of which it con&s;i&s;ts.&mdash;This enquiry has been already an&s;wered. The truth is, that &s;uch a &s;upreme controuling power ought to exi&s;t no where except in &s;uch a SENATE or body of delegates as that de&s;cribed in page 7; and that the authority or &s;upremacy
<PB N="18" REF="015032_0018_0F955079753E2850">
of even this Senate ought to be limited to the common concerns of the <HI>Empire.</HI>&mdash;I think I have proved that the fundamental principles of Liberty nece&s;&s;arily require this.</P>
<P>In a word. An <HI>Empire</HI> is a collection of &s;tates or commu|nities united by &s;ome common bond or tye. If the&s;e &s;tates have each of them free con&s;titutions of government, and, with re&s;pect to taxation and internal legi&s;lation, are independent of the other &s;tates, but united by compacts or alliances, or &s;ub|jection to a Great <HI>Council,</HI> repre&s;enting the whole, or to one monarch entru&s;ted with the &s;upreme executive power: In the&s;e circum&s;tances, the Empire will be an Empire of Freemen. &mdash;If, on the contrary, like the different provinces &s;ubject to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> none of the &s;tates po&s;&s;e&s;s any independent legi&s;lative authority; but are all &s;ubject to an ab&s;olute mo|narch, who&s;e will is their law; then is the Empire an Empire of Slaves.&mdash;If one of the &s;tates is free, but governs by its will all the other &s;tates; then is the Empire, like that of the Romans in the times of the republic, an Empire con&s;i&s;ting of one &s;tate free, and the re&s;t in &s;lavery: Nor does it make any more difference in this ca&s;e, that the governing &s;tate is it&s;elf free, than it does in the ca&s;e of a kingdom &s;ubject to a <HI>de&s;pot,</HI> that this de&s;pot is him&s;elf free. I have before ob&s;erved, that this only makes the &s;lavery wor&s;e. There is, in the one ca&s;e, a chance, that in the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of de&s;pots, a good one will &s;ometimes ari&s;e. But bodies of men continue the &s;ame; and have generally proved the mo&s;t unrelenting of all tyrants.</P>
<P>A great writer, before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;quieu's Spirit of Laws, Vol. 1, Book 11. C. xix.</NOTE> quoted, ob&s;erves of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> that while Liberty was at the center, tyranny pre|vailed in the di&s;tant provinces; that &s;uch as were free under it were extremely &s;o, while tho&s;e who were &s;laves groaned under the extremity of &s;lavery; and that the &s;ame events that <HI>de&s;troyed</HI> the liberty of the former, <HI>gave</HI> liberty to the latter.</P>
<P>The liberty of the <HI>Romans,</HI> therefore, was only an additional calamity to the provinces governed by them; and though it might have been &s;aid of the <HI>Citizens</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> that they were the "free&s;t members of any civil &s;ociety in the known world;" yet of the <HI>Subjects</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> it mu&s;t have been &s;aid, that they were the complete&s;t &s;laves in the known world.&mdash;How remarkable is it, that this very people, once the free&s;t of mankind, but at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t proud and tyrannical, &s;hould become at la&s;t the mo&s;t contemptible and abject &s;laves that ever exi&s;ted?</P>

We have been &s;o u&s;ed to &s;peak of the Colo|nies as <HI>our</HI> Colonies, and to think of them as in a &s;tate of &s;ub|ordination to us, and as holding their exi&s;tence in <HI>America</HI> only for our u&s;e, that it is no wonder the prejudices of many are alarmed, when they find a different doctrine maintained. The meane&s;t per&s;on among us is di&s;po&s;ed to look upon him&s;elf&punc; as having a body of &s;ubjects in <HI>America</HI>; and to be offended at the denial of his right to make laws for them, though perhaps he does not know what colour they are of, or what language they talk.&mdash;Such are the natural prejudices of this country.&mdash; But the time is coming, I hope, when the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of them will be &s;een; and more ju&s;t &s;entiments prevail.</P>
<P>Before I proceed, I beg it may be attended to, that I have cho&s;en to try this que&s;tion by the general principle of Civil Liberty; and not by the practice of former times; or by the <HI>Charters</HI> granted the Colonies.&mdash;The arguments <HI>for</HI> them, drawn from the&s;e la&s;t topics, appear to me greatly to outweigh the arguments <HI>again&s;t</HI> them. But I wi&s;h to have this que&s;tion brought to a higher te&s;t, and &s;urer i&s;&s;ue. The que&s;tion with all liberal enquirers ought to be, not what juri&s;diction over them <HI>Precedents, Statutes,</HI> and <HI>Charters</HI> give, but that rea&s;on and equity, and the rights of humanity give.&mdash;This is, in truth, a que&s;tion which no kingdom has ever before had occa&s;ion to agitate. The ca&s;e of a free country branching it&s;elf out in the

manner <HI>Britain</HI> has done, and &s;ending to a di&s;tant world colo|nies which have there, from &s;mall beginnings, and under free legi&s;latures of their own, increa&s;ed, and formed a body of pow|erful &s;tates, likely &s;oon to become &s;uperior to the parent &s;tate. &mdash;This is a ca&s;e which is new in the hi&s;tory of mankind; and it is extremely improper to judge of it by the rules of any nar|row and partial policy; or to con&s;ider it on any other ground than the general one of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice.&mdash;Tho&s;e who will be candid enough to judge on this ground, and who can dive&s;t them&s;elves of national prejudices, will not, I fancy, re|main long un&s;atisfied.&mdash;But alas! Matters are gone too far. The di&s;pute probably mu&s;t be &s;ettled another way; and the &s;word alone, I am afraid, is now to determine what the rights of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America</HI> are.&mdash;Shocking &s;ituation!&mdash;Dete&s;ted be the mea&s;ures which have brought us into it: And, if we are endeavouring to enforce inju&s;tice, cur&s;ed will be the war. &mdash;A retreat, however, is not yet impracticable. The duty we owe our gracious &s;overeign obliges us to rely on his di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;tay the &s;word, and to promote the happine&s;s of all the different parts of the Empire at the head of which he is placed. With &s;ome hopes, therefore, that it may not be too late to rea&s;on on this &s;ubject, I will, in the following Sections, enquire what the war with <HI>America</HI> is in the following re&s;pects.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the Ju&s;tice of the War with America.</HEAD>
<P>THE enquiry, whether the war with the Colonies is a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> war, will be be be&s;t determined by &s;tating the power over them, which it is the end of the war to maintain: And this connot be better done, than in the words of an act of Parlia|ment, made on purpo&s;e to define it. That act, it is well known, declares,
<Q>That this kingdom has power, and of right ought to have power to make laws and &s;tatutes to bind the Colonies, and people of <HI>America,</HI> in all ca&s;es whatever.</Q>
<PB N="21" REF="015032_0021_0F95507C78C3AD60">
&mdash;Dreadful power indeed! I defy any one to expre&s;s &s;lavery in &s;tronger language. It is the &s;ame as declaring "that we have a right to do with them what we plea&s;e."&mdash;I will not wa&s;te my time by applying to &s;uch a claim any of the preceeding arguments. If my reader does not feel more in this ca&s;e, than words can expre&s;s, all rea&s;oning mu&s;t be vain.</P>
<P>But, probably, mo&s;t per&s;ons will be for u&s;ing milder lan|guage; and for &s;aying no more than, that the united legi&s;la|tures of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> have of right power to tax the Colonies, and a &s;upremacy of legi&s;lation over <HI>America.</HI>&mdash; But this comes to the &s;ame. If it means any thing, it means, that the property, and the legi&s;lations of the Colonies, are &s;ub|ject to the ab&s;olute di&s;cretion of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and ought of right to be &s;o. The nature of the thing admits of no limita|tion. The Colonies can never be admitted to be judges, how far the authority over them in the&s;e ca&s;es &s;hall extend. This would be to de&s;troy it entirely,&mdash;If <HI>any</HI> part of their property is &s;ubject to our di&s;cretion, the <HI>whole</HI> mu&s;t be &s;o. If we have a right to interfere at all in their internal legi&s;lations, we have a right to interfere as far as we think proper.&mdash;It is &s;elf-evident, that this leaves them nothing they can call <HI>their own.</HI>&mdash;And what is it that can give to any people &s;uch a &s;upremacy over another people?&mdash;I have already examin|ed the principal an&s;wers which have been given to this enquiry. But it will not be ami&s;s in this place to go over &s;ome of them again.</P>
<P>It has been urged, that &s;uch a right mu&s;t be lodged &s;ome|where, "in order to pre&s;erve the UNITY of the Briti&s;h Empire."</P>
<P>Pleas of this &s;ort have, in all ages, been u&s;ed to ju&s;tify tyranny.&mdash;They have in RELIGION given ri&s;e to num|berle&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive claims, and &s;lavi&s;h Hierarchies. And in the <HI>Romi&s;h Communion</HI> particularly, it is well known, that the POPE claims the title and powers of the &s;upreme head on earth of the Chri&s;tian church, in order to pre&s;erve its UNITY. &mdash;With re&s;pect to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire, nothing can be more prepo&s;terous than to endeavour to maintain its unity, by &s;etting up &s;uch a method of e&s;tabli&s;hing unity, which, like the &s;imilar method in religion, can produce nothing but mi&s;chief. &mdash;The truth is, that a common relation to one &s;upreme executive head; an exchange of kind offices; tyes of intere&s;t and affection, and <HI>compacts,</HI> are &s;ufficient to give the Briti&s;h
<PB N="22" REF="015032_0022_0F95507D356FFA38">
Empire all the unity that is nece&s;&s;ary. But if not&mdash;If, in order to pre&s;erve its <HI>Unity,</HI> one half of it mu&s;t be en|&s;laved to the other half, let it, in the name of God, want Unity.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid of "the <HI>Superiority</HI> of the Briti&s;h State." But what gives us our &s;uperiority?&mdash;Is it our <HI>Wealth?</HI>&mdash;This never confers real dignity. On the contrary: Its effect is always to deba&s;e, intoxicate, and corrupt.&mdash;Is it the <HI>numbers of our people?</HI> The Colonies will &s;oon be equal to us in num|ber.&mdash;Is it our <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Virtue?</HI> They are probably <HI>equally</HI> knowing, and <HI>more</HI> virtuous. There are names among them that will not &s;toop to any names among the philo&s;ophers and politicians of this i&s;land.</P>
<P>"But we are the PARENT STATE."&mdash;The&s;e are the magic words which have fascinated and mi&s;led us.&mdash;The Engli&s;h came from <HI>Germany.</HI> Does that give the <HI>German</HI> &s;tates a right to tax us?&mdash;Children, having no property, and being incapable of guiding them&s;elves, the author of nature has committed the care of them to their parents, and &s;ubjected them to their ab&s;olute authority. But there is a period when, having acquired property, and a capacity of judging for them|&s;elves, they become independent agents; and when, for this rea&s;on, the authority of their parents cea&s;es, and becomes nothing but the re&s;pect and influence due to benefactors. Sup|po&s;ing, therefore, that the order of nature in e&s;tabli&s;hing the relation between parents and children, ought to have been the rule of our conduct to the Colonies, we &s;hould have been gra|dually relaxing our authority as they grew up. But like mad parents, we have done the contrary; and, at the very time when our authority &s;hould have been mo&s;t relaxed, we have carried it to the greate&s;t extent, and exerci&s;ed it with the greate&s;t rigour. No wonder then, that they have turned upon us; and obliged us to remember that they are not children.</P>
<P><Q>But we have, it is &s;aid, protected them, and run deeply in debt on their account.</Q> &mdash;The full an&s;wer to this has been already given (p. 16, 17.) Will any one &s;ay, that all we have done for them has not been more on our <HI>own</HI> account,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is particularly true of the <HI>bounties</HI> granted on &s;ome American commodities (as pitch, tar, indigo, &amp;c.) when imported into <HI>Britain</HI>; for it is well known, that the end of granting them was, to get tho&s;e commodities cheaper from the Colonies and in return for our manufactures, which we u&s;ed to get from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and other foreign countries. And this is expre&s;&s;ed in the preambles of the laws which grant the&s;e bounties. See the Appeal to the Ju&s;tice, &amp;c. page 21, third edition. It is, therefore, &s;trange that Doctor TUCKER and others, &s;hould have in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much upon the&s;e bounties as favours and indulgences to the Co|lonies,&mdash;But it is &s;till more &s;trange, that the &s;ame repre&s;entation &s;hould have been made of the compen&s;ations granted them for doing more during the la&s;t war in a&s;&s;i&s;ting us than could have been rea&s;onably expected; and al&s;o of the &s;ums we have &s;pent in maintaining troops among them <HI>without</HI> their con&s;ent; and in oppo&s;ition to their wi&s;hes.&mdash;See a Pamphlet, entitled "The rightt of Great Britain a&s;&s;erted again&s;t the claims of America."</NOTE> than on

<HI>theirs?</HI>&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e the contrary. Have they done nothing for us? Have they made no compen&s;ation for the protection they have received? Have they not helped us to pay our <HI>taxes,</HI> to &s;upport our poor, and to bear the burden of our debts, by taking from us, at our own price, all the commodities with which we can &s;upply them?&mdash;Have they not, for our advan|tage, &s;ubmitted to many re&s;traints in acquiring property? Mu&s;t they likewi&s;e re&s;ign to us the di&s;po&s;al of that property?&mdash; Has not their exclu&s;ive trade with us been for many years one of the chief &s;ources of our national wealth and power?&mdash; In all our wars have they not fought by our &s;ide, and contri|buted much to our &s;ucce&s;s? In the la&s;t war particularly, it is well known, that they ran them&s;elves deeply in debt; and that the parliament thought it nece&s;&s;ary to grant them con&s;iderable &s;ums annually as compen&s;ations for going beyond their abilities in a&s;&s;i&s;ting us. And in this cour&s;e would they have continued for many future years; perhaps, for ever.&mdash;In &s;hort, were an accurate account &s;tated, it is by no means certain which &s;ide would appear to be mo&s;t indebted. When a&s;ked as <HI>free|men,</HI> they have hitherto &s;eldom di&s;covered any reluctance in giving. But, in obedience to a demand, and with the bayonet at their brea&s;ts, they will give us nothing but blood.</P>
<P>It is farther &s;aid, "that the land on which they &s;ettled was ours."&mdash;But how came it to be ours? If &s;ailing along a coa&s;t can give a right to a country, then might the people of <HI>Japan</HI> become, as &s;oon as they plea&s;e, the proprietors of <HI>Britain.</HI> Nothing can be more chimerical than property founded on &s;uch a rea&s;on. If the land on which the Colonies fir&s;t &s;ettled had any proprietors, they were the natives. The greate&s;t part of it they bought of the natives. They have &s;ince cleared and cultivated it; and, without any help from us, converted a wilderne&s;s into fruitful and plea&s;ent fields. It is, therefore, now on a double account their property; and no power on earth can have any right to di&s;turb them in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, or to take from them without their con&s;ent, any part of its produce.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="015032_0024_0F95507EB64EB1D8">But let it be granted, that, the land was ours. Did they not &s;ettle upon it under the faith of charters which promi&s;ed them the enjoyment of all the rights of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>; and allowed them to tax them&s;elves, and to be governed by legi&s;latures of their own, &s;imilar to ours? The&s;e charters were given them by an authority, which at the time was thought competent; and they have been rendered &s;acred by an acquie&s;cence on our part for more than a century. Can it be wondered at, that the Colonies &s;hould revolt, when they found their Charters violated; and an attempt made to force INNOVATIONS upon them by famine and the &s;word?&mdash;But I lay no &s;tre&s;s on charters. They derive their rights from a higher &s;ource. It is incon&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e to imagine, that any people would ever think of &s;ettling in a di&s;tant country, on any &s;uch condition, as that the people from whom they with|drew, &s;hould forever be ma&s;ters of their property, and have power to &s;ubject them to any modes of government they plea&s;ed. And had there been expre&s;s &s;tipulations to this purpo&s;e in all the charters of the colonies, they would, in my opinion, be no more bound by them, than if it had been &s;tipulated with them, that they &s;hould go naked, or expo&s;e them&s;elves to the incur&s;ion of wolves and tigers.</P>
<P>The defective &s;tate of the repre&s;entation of this kingdom has been farther pleaded to prove our right to tax <HI>America.</HI> We &s;ubmit to a parliament that does not repre&s;ent us, and therefore they ought.&mdash;How &s;trange an argument is this? It is &s;aying we want liberty; and therefore, they ought to want it.&mdash;Suppo&s;e it true, that they are indeed contending for a better con&s;titution of government, and more liberty than we enjoy. Ought this to make us angry?&mdash;Who is there that does not &s;ee the danger to which this country is expo&s;ed?&mdash;Is it generous, becau&s;e we are in a &s;ink, to endeavour to draw them into it? Ought we not rather to wi&s;h earne&s;tly, that there may at lea&s;t be ONE FREE COUNTRY left upon earth, to which we may fly, when venality, luxury, and vice have completed the ruin of liberty here?</P>
<P>It is, however, by no means true, that <HI>America</HI> has no more right to be exempted from taxation by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament, than <HI>Britain</HI> it&s;elf.&mdash;<HI>Here,</HI> all freeholders, and burge&s;&s;es in boroughs, are repre&s;ented. <HI>There,</HI> not one <HI>Freeholder,</HI> or any other per&s;on, is repre&s;ented.&mdash;<HI>Here,</HI> the <HI>aids</HI> granted by the repre&s;ented part of the kingdom mu&s;t be proportionably
<PB N="25" REF="015032_0025_0F95507F7881BA90">
<HI>paid</HI> by them&s;elves; and the laws they make for <HI>others,</HI> they at the &s;ame time make for <HI>them&s;elves. There,</HI> the aids they would grant would not be <HI>paid,</HI> but <HI>received,</HI> by them&s;elves; and the laws they made would be made for <HI>others only.</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort, the relation of one country to another country, who&s;e repre|&s;entatives have the power of taxing it (and of appropriating the money rai&s;ed by the taxes) is much the &s;ame with the relation of a country to a &s;ingle de&s;pot, or a body of de&s;pots, within it&s;elf, inve&s;ted with the like power. In both ca&s;es, the people taxed and tho&s;e who tax have &s;eparate intere&s;ts; nor can there be any thing to check oppre&s;&s;ion, be&s;ides either the abilities of the people taxed, or the humanity of the <HI>taxers.</HI>&mdash; But indeed I can never hope to convince that per&s;on of any thing, who does not &s;ee an e&s;&s;ential difference <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It gives me plea&s;ure to find, that the author of the <HI>Remarks on the Principal Acts of the</HI> 13<HI>th Parliament of Great Britain,</HI> &amp;c. acknowledges this difference. &mdash;It has, however, been at the &s;ame time mortifying to me to find &s;o able a writer adopting &s;uch principles of government, as are contained in this work. According to him, a people have no property or rights, except &s;uch as their <HI>Civil governors</HI> are plea&s;ed not to take from them.

<P>But enough has been &s;aid by others on this point; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for me to throw any new light upon it. To fini&s;h, therefore, what I meant to offer under this head, I mu&s;t beg that the following con&s;iderations may be particularly attended to.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion now between us and the Colonies is, Whe|ther, in re&s;pect of taxation and internal legi&s;lation, they are bound to be &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of this kingdom: Or, in other words, Whether the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament has or has not of right, a power to di&s;po&s;e of their property, and to model as it plea&s;es their governments?&mdash;To this &s;upremacy over them, we &s;ay, we are entitled; and in order to maintain it, we have begun the pre&s;ent war.&mdash;Let me here enquire,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Whether, if we have now this &s;upremacy, we &s;hall not be equally entitled to it in any future time?&mdash;They are now but little &s;hort of half our number. To this number they have grown, from a &s;mall body of original &s;ettlers, by a

very rapid increa&s;e. The probability is, that they will go on to increa&s;e; and that, in 50 or 60 years, they will be <HI>double</HI> our number;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Ob&s;ervations on Rever&s;ionary Payments, page 207, &amp;c.</NOTE> and form a mighty Empire, con&s;i&s;ting of a variety of &s;tates, all equal or &s;uperior to our&s;elves in all the arts and accompli&s;hments, which give dignity and happine&s;s to human life. In that period, will they be &s;till bound to acknowledge that &s;upremacy over them which we now claim? Can there be any per&s;on who will a&s;&s;ert this; or who&s;e mind does not revolt at the idea of a va&s;t continent, holding all that is valuable to it, at the di&s;cretion of a handful of people on the other &s;ide the <HI>Atlantic?</HI>&mdash;But if, at that period, this would be unrea&s;onable; what makes it otherwi&s;e <HI>now?</HI>&mdash;Draw the line, if you can.&mdash;But there is &s;till a greater difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Britain</HI> is now, I will &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;eat of Liberty and virtue, and its legi&s;lature con&s;i&s;ts of a body of able and independent men, who govern with wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice. The time may come when all will be rever&s;ed: When its excellent con&s;ti|tution of government will be &s;ubverted: When pre&s;&s;ed by debts and taxes, it will be greedy to draw to it&s;elf an increa&s;e of revenue from every di&s;tant Province, in order to ea&s;e its own burthens: When the influence of the Crown, &s;trengthen|ed by luxury and an univer&s;al profligacy of manners, will have tainted every heart, broken down every fence of Liberty, and rendered us a nation of tame and contented va&s;&s;als: When a general <HI>Election</HI> will be nothing but a general <HI>Auction</HI> of <HI>Boroughs</HI>: And when the PARLIAMENT, the Grand Council of the nation, and once the faithful guardian of the &s;tate, and a terror to evil mini&s;ters, will be degenerated into a body of <HI>Sycophants,</HI> dependent and venal, always ready to confirm <HI>any</HI> mea&s;ures; and little more than a public court for regi&s;tering royal edicts.&mdash;Such, it is po&s;&s;ible, may, &s;ome time or other, be the &s;tate of <HI>Great Britain.</HI>&mdash;What will, at that period, be the duty of the Colonies? Will they be &s;till bound to un|conditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? Mu&s;t they always continue an appen|dage to our government! and follow it implicitly through every change that can happen to it?&mdash;Wretched condition, indeed, of millions of freemen as good as our&s;elves &mdash; Will you &s;ay that we now govern equitably; and that there is no danger of any &s;uch revolution?&mdash;Would to God this were true.&mdash;But will you not always &s;ay the &s;ame?

judge whether we govern equitably or not?&mdash;Can you give the Colonies any <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> that &s;uch a period will never come? &mdash;Once more.</P>
<P>If we have indeed that power which we claim over the legi&s;lations and internal rights of the Colonies, may we not, whenever we plea&s;e, &s;ubject them to the arbitrary power of the crown?&mdash;I do not mean that this would be a di&s;ad|vantageous change: For I have before ob&s;erved, that if a people are to be &s;ubject to an external power over which they have no command, it is better that power &s;hould be lodged in the hands of one man than of a multitude. But many per&s;ons think otherwi&s;e; and &s;uch ought to con&s;ider that, if this would be a calamity, the condition of the Colonies mu&s;t be deplorable.&mdash;"A government by King, Lords, and Commons, (it has been &s;aid) is the perfection of government;" and &s;o it is, when the Commons are a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the people; and when al&s;o, it is not extended to any di&s;tant people, or communities, not repre&s;ented. But if this is the <HI>be&s;t,</HI> a go|vernment by a king only mu&s;t be the <HI>wor&s;t</HI>; and every claim implying a right to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a government among any people mu&s;t be unju&s;t and cruel.&mdash;It is &s;elf-evident, that by claiming a right to alter the con&s;titution of the Colonies, according to our di&s;cretion, we claim this power: And it is a power that we have thought fit to exerci&s;e in <HI>one</HI> of our Colonies; and that we have attempted to exerci&s;e in <HI>another. &mdash;Canada,</HI> according to the late exten&s;ion of its limits, is a country almo&s;t as large as half <HI>Europe</HI>; and it may po&s;&s;ibly come in time to be filled with Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. The <HI>Quebec</HI> act makes the king of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> a de&s;pot over all that country.&mdash;In the Province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay</HI> the &s;ame thing has been attempted and begun.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Whether the War with <HI>America</HI> is ju&s;tified by the Principles of the Con&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE propo&s;ed, in the next place, to examine the war with the Colonies by the principles of the con&s;titution.&mdash; I know, that it is common to &s;ay that we are now maintaining the con&s;titution in <HI>America.</HI> If this means that we are endea|vouring to e&s;tabli&s;h our own con&s;titution of government there; it is by no means true; nor, were it true, would it be right. They have chartered governments of their own with which they are plea&s;ed; and which, if any power on earth may change without their con&s;ent, that power may likewi&s;e, if it thinks proper, deliver them over to the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI>&mdash; Suppo&s;e the Colonies of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> had, by compacts, enjoyed for near a century and a half, free governments open to all the world, and under which they had grown and flouri&s;hed; what &s;hould we think of tho&s;e kingdoms, were they to attempt to de&s;troy their governments, and to force upon them their own mode of government? Should we not

applaud any zeal they di&s;covered in repelling &s;uch an injury? &mdash;But the truth is, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, that we are not maintaining but violating our own con&s;titution in <HI>America.</HI> The e&s;&s;ence of our con&s;titution con&s;i&s;ts in its independency.

A free government lo&s;es its nature from the moment it becomes liable to be com|manded or altered by any &s;uperior power.</P>
<P>But I intended here principally to make the following ob|&s;ervation. The fundamental principle of our government is, "The right of a people to give and grant their own money." &mdash;It is of no con&s;equence, in this ca&s;e, whether we enjoy this right in a proper manner or not. Mo&s;t certainly we do not. It is, however, the <HI>principle</HI> on which our government, as a <HI>free</HI> government, is founded. The <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of the con&s;titution gives it us; and, however imperfectly enjoyed, we glory in it as our fir&s;t and greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing. It was an attempt to encroach upon this right, in a trifling in&s;tance, that produced the civil war in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t.&mdash;Ought not our brethren in <HI>America</HI> to enjoy this right as well as our&s;elves? Do the principles of the con&s;titution give it us, but deny it to them? Or can we, with any decency, pretend that when we give to the king <HI>their</HI> money, we give him <HI>our own?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of <HI>Taxation no Tyranny</HI> will undoubtedly a&s;&s;ert this without he&s;itation, for in page 69 he compares our pre&s;ent &s;ituation with re&s;pect to the Colonies to that of the antient <HI>Scythians,</HI> who, upon returning from a war, <HI>found them&s;elves &s;hut out of their own</HI> HOUSES <HI>by their</HI> SLAVES.</NOTE>&mdash;What diffe|rence does it make, that in the time of <HI>Charles the Fir&s;t</HI> the at|tempt to take away this right was made by <HI>one man</HI>; but that, in the ca&s;e of <HI>America,</HI> it is made by a body of men?</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the Policy of the War with <HI>America.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN writing the pre&s;ent Section, I have entered upon a &s;ubject of the la&s;t importance, on which much has been &s;aid by other writers with great force, and in the able&s;t manner.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See particularly, a &s;peech intended to have been &s;poken on the bill for altering the Charter of the Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay; the <HI>Con&s;iderations on the Mea|&s;ures carrying on with re&s;pect to the Briti&s;h Colonies</HI>; and the <HI>Two Appeals to the Ju&s;tice and Intere&s;ts of the People.</HI></NOTE> But I am not willing to omit any topic which I think of great importance, merely becau&s;e it has already been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: And, with re&s;pect to this in particular, it will, I believe, be found that &s;ome of the ob&s;ervations on which I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t, have not been &s;ufficiently attended to.</P>
<P>The object of this war has been often enough declared to be "maintaining the &s;upremacy of this country over the colonies." I have already enquired how far rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, the princi|ples of Liberty, and the rights of humanity, entitle us to this &s;uperemacy. Setting a&s;ide, therefore, now, all con&s;iderations of this kind, I would ob&s;erve, that this &s;upremacy is to be maintained, either merely <HI>for it's own &s;ake,</HI> or for the &s;ake of &s;ome public intere&s;t connected with it and dependent upon it. &mdash;If <HI>for its own &s;ake</HI>; the only object of the war is the exten|&s;ion of dominion; and its only motive is the lu&s;t of power.&mdash; All government, even <HI>within</HI> a &s;tate, becomes tyrannical, as far as it is a needle&s;s and wanton exerci&s;e of power; or is car|ried farther than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the peace and to &s;ecure the &s;afety of the &s;tate. This is what an excel|lent writer calls GOVERNING TOO MUCH; and its effect mu&s;t always be, weakening government by rendering it con|temptible and odious.&mdash;Nothing can be of more importance, in governing di&s;tant provinces and adju&s;ting the cla&s;hing inte|re&s;ts of different &s;ocieties, than attention to this remark. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is <HI>particularly</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to make a &s;paring u&s;e of power.&mdash;Happy would it have been for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> had this been remembered by tho&s;e who have lately conducted its affairs. But our policy has been of another kind. At a period when our policy &s;hould have been mo&s;t concealed, it has been brought mo&s;t in view; and, by a progre&s;&s;ion of violent mea&s;ures, every one of which has increa&s;ed di&s;tre&s;s, we have given the world rea&s;on to conclude, that we are acquainted with no other method of governing than <HI>by force.</HI>&mdash;What a
<PB N="31" REF="015032_0031_0F955084B7631F78">
&s;hocking mi&s;take?&mdash;If our object is power, we &s;hould have known better how to u&s;e it; and our rulers &s;hould have con|&s;idered, that freemen will always revolt at the &s;ight of a naked &s;word; and that the complicated affairs of a great kingdom, holding in &s;ubordination to it a multitude of di&s;tant commu|nities, all jealous of their rights, and warmed with &s;pirits as high as our own, require not only the mo&s;t &s;kilful, but the mo&s;t cautious and tender management. The con&s;equences of a different management we are now feeling, We &s;ee our|&s;elves driven among rocks, and in danger of being lo&s;t.</P>
<P>There are the following rea&s;ons which &s;eem to make it too probable, that the pre&s;ent conte&s;t with <HI>America</HI> is a conte&s;t for power only, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have heard it &s;aid by a per&s;on in one of the fir&s;t departments of the &s;tate, that the pre&s;ent conte&s;t is for DOMINION on the &s;ide of the colonies, as well as on ours: And &s;o it is, indeed; but with this e&s;&s;ential difference. <HI>We</HI> are &s;truggling for dominion over OTHERS. <HI>They</HI> are &s;truggling for SELF dominion&punc; The noble&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings.</NOTE> ab&s;tracted from all the advantages connected with it.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> There is a love of power for it own &s;ake inherent in human nature; and it cannot be uncharitable to &s;uppo&s;e that the nation in general, and the cabinet in particular, are too likely to be influenced by it. What can be more flattering than to look acro&s;s the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> and to &s;ee in the boundle&s;s continent of <HI>America,</HI> increa&s;ing MILLIONS whom we have a right to order as we plea&s;e, who hold their property at our di&s;|po&s;al, and who have no other law than our will. With what complacency have we been u&s;ed to talk of them as OUR &s;ub|jects?&mdash;Is it not the interruption they now give to this plea|&s;ure: Is it not the oppo&s;ition they make to our pride; and not any injury they have done us, that is the &s;ecret &s;pring of our pre&s;ent animo&s;ity again&s;t them?&mdash;I wi&s;h all in this kingdom would examine them&s;elves carefully on this point. Perhaps, they might find, that they have not known what &s;pirit they are of.&mdash;Perhaps they would become &s;en&s;ible, that it was a &s;pirit of domination, more than a regard to the true intere&s;t of this country, that lately led &s;o many of them, with &s;uch &s;avage folly, to addre&s;s the throne for the &s;laughter of their brethren in <HI>America,</HI> if they will not &s;ubmit to them; and to make offers of their lives and fortunes for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;Indeed, I am per&s;uaded, that, where pride and the lu&s;t of dominion exterminated from every heart among us, and the humility of Chri&s;tians infu&s;ed in their room, this quarrel would be &s;oon ended.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="32" REF="015032_0032_0F955085760B4808">2<HI>dly.</HI> Another rea&s;on for believing that this is a conte&s;t for power only is, that our mini&s;ters have frequently declared, that their object is not to draw a revenue from <HI>America</HI>; and that many of tho&s;e who are warme&s;t for continuing it, repre&s;ent the <HI>American trade</HI> as of no great con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But what de&s;erves particular con&s;ideration here is, that this is a conte&s;t from which no advantage can po&s;&s;ibly be derived, &mdash;Not a revenue: For the provinces of America, when de&s;o|lated, will afford no revenue; or if it &s;hould, the expence of &s;ubduing them and keeping them in &s;ubjection will much exceed that revenue.&mdash;Not any of the advantages of trade: For it is a folly, next to in&s;anity, to think trade can be pro|moted by impoveri&s;hing our cu&s;tomers, and fixing in their minds an everla&s;ting abhorrence of us.&mdash;It remains, there|fore, that this war can have no other object than the exten&s;ion of power.&mdash;Mi&s;erable reflection!&mdash;To &s;heath our &s;words in the bowels of our brethren, and &s;pread mi&s;ery and ruin among a happy people, for no other end than to oblige them to acknowledge our &s;upremacy. How horrid!&mdash;This is the cur&s;ed ambition that led a <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and an <HI>Alexander,</HI> and many other mad conquerors, to attack peaceful communities, and to lay wa&s;te the earth.</P>
<P>But a wor&s;e principle than even this, influences &s;ome among us. Pride and the love of dominion are principles hate|ful enough; but blind re&s;entment and the de&s;ire of revenge are infernal principles; and the&s;e, I am afraid, have no &s;mall &s;hare at pre&s;ent in guiding our public conduct.&mdash;One cannot help indeed being a&s;toni&s;hed at the virulence, with which &s;ome &s;peak on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion again&s;t the Colonies.&mdash;For, what have they done?&mdash;Have they cro&s;&s;ed the ocean and in|vaded us? Have they attempted to take from us the fruits of our labour, and to overturn that form of government which we hold &s;o &s;acred?&mdash;This cannot be pretended.&mdash;On the contrary. This is what we have done to them.&mdash;We have tran&s;ported our&s;elves to their peaceful retreats, and employed our fleets and armies to &s;top up their ports, to de&s;troy their commerce, to &s;eize their effects and to burn their towns. Would we but let them alone, and &s;uffer them to enjoy in &s;ecurity their property and governments, in&s;tead of di&s;turbing us, they would thank and ble&s;s us. And yet it is WE WHO imagine our&s;elves ill-u&s;ed.&mdash;The truth is, we expected to find them a cowardly rabble who would lie quietly at our feet,
<PB N="33" REF="015032_0033_0F9550863610D5E8">
and they have di&s;appointed us. They have ri&s;en in their own defence, and repelled force by force. They deny the pleni|tude of our power over them; and in&s;i&s;t on being treated as free communities &mdash;It is THIS that has provoked us; and kindled our governors into rage.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall not be here under&s;tood to intimate, that <HI>all</HI> who promote this war are actuated by the&s;e principles. Some, I doubt not, are influenced by no other principle, than a re|gard to what they think the authority of this country over its Colonies, and to the unity and indivi&s;ibility of the Briti&s;h Empire. I wi&s;h &s;uch could be engaged to enter thoroughly into the enquiry, which has been the &s;ubject of the fir&s;t part of this pamphlet; and to con&s;ider, particularly, how different a thing maintaining the authority of government <HI>within</HI> a &s;tate is from maintaining the authority of one people over another, already happy in the enjoyment of a government of their own. I wi&s;h farther they would con&s;ider, that the de&s;ire of maintaining authority is warrantable, only &s;o far as it is the means of promoting &s;ome end, and doing &s;ome good; and that, before we re&s;olve to &s;pread famine and fire through a country in order to make it acknowledge our authority, we ought to be a&s;&s;ured that great advantages will ari&s;e not only to our&s;elves but to the country we wi&s;h to conquer.&mdash;That from the pre&s;ent conte&s;t no advantage to our&s;elves can ari&s;e, has been already &s;hewn, and will pre&s;ently be &s;hewn more at large.&mdash; That no advantage to the Colonies can ari&s;e from it, need not, I hope, be &s;hewn. It has however been a&s;&s;erted, that even <HI>their</HI> good is intended by this war. Many of us are per&s;uaded, that they will be much happier under our government, than under any government of their own; and that their liberties will be &s;afer when held for them by us, than when tru&s;ted in their own hands.&mdash;How kind is it thus to take upon us the trouble of judging for them what is mo&s;t for their happine&s;s? Nothing can be kinder, except the re&s;olution we have formed to extirminate them, if they will not &s;ubmit to our judgment. &mdash;What &s;trange language have I &s;ometimes heard? By an armed force we are now endeavouring to de&s;troy the laws and governments of America; and yet I have heard it &s;aid, that we are endeavouring to &s;upport law and government there. We are in&s;i&s;ting upon our right to levy contributions upon them; and to maintain this right, we are bringing upon them all the mi&s;eries a people can endure; and yet it is a&s;&s;erted; that we mean nothing but their &s;ecurity and happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="015032_0034_0F955086F7C90568">But I have wandered a little from the point I intended prin|cipally to in&s;i&s;t upon in this &s;ection, which is,
<Q>the folly, in re&s;pect of policy, of the mea&s;ures which have brought on this conte&s;t; and its pernicious and fatal tendency.</Q></P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervations will, I believe abundantly prove this.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> There are points which are likely always to &s;uffer by di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Of this kind are mo&s;t points of authority and pre|rogative; and the be&s;t policy is to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, giving any occa&s;ion for calling them into que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The Colonies were at the beginning of this reign in the habit of acknowledging our authority, and of allowing us as much power over them as our intere&s;t required; and more, in &s;ome in&s;tances, than we could rea&s;onably claim. This habit they would have retained; and had we, in&s;tead of impo&s;ing new burdens upon them, and increa&s;ing their re&s;traints, &s;tudied to promote their commerce, and to grant them new Indulgen|ces, they would have been always growing more attached to us. Luxury, and, together with it, their dependence upon us, and our influence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has been our policy with re&s;pect to the people of <HI>Ireland</HI>; and the con&s;e|quence is, that we now &s;ee their parliament as obedient as we can wi&s;h.</NOTE> in their a&s;&s;emblies, would have increa&s;ed, till in time perhaps they would become as corrupt as our&s;elves; and we might have &s;ucceeded to our wi&s;hes in e&s;tabli&s;hing our authority over them.&mdash;But, happily for them, we have cho&s;en a different cour&s;e. By exertions of authority which have alarmed them, they have been put upon examining into the grounds of all our claims, and forced to give up their luxuries, and to &s;eek all their re&s;ources within them&s;elves: And the i&s;&s;ue is likely to prove the lo&s;s of <HI>all</HI> our authority over them, and of all the advantages connected with it. So little do men in power &s;ometimes know how to pre&s;erve power; and &s;o remarkably does the de&s;ire of extending do|minion &s;ometimes de&s;troy it.&mdash;Mankind are naturally di&s;|po&s;ed to continue in &s;ubjection to that mode of government, be it what it will, under which they have been born and edu|cated. Nothing rou&s;es them into re&s;i&s;tance but gro&s;s abu&s;es, or &s;ome particular oppre&s;&s;ions out of the road to which they have been u&s;ed. And he who will examine the hi&s;tory of the world will find, there has generally been more rea&s;on for com|plaining that they have been too patient, than that they have been turbulent and rebellious.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="015032_0035_0F955087B704BB68">Our governors, ever &s;ince I can remember, have been jealous, that the Colonies, &s;ome time or other, would throw off their dependence. This jealou&s;y was not founded on any of their acts or declarations. They have always, while at <HI>peace</HI> with us, di&s;claimed any &s;uch de&s;ign; and they have continued to di&s;claim it &s;ince they have been at <HI>war</HI> with us. I have rea&s;on, indeed, to believe, that independency is, even at this moment, generally dreaded among them as a calamity to which they are in danger of being driven, in order to avoid a greater.&mdash;The jealou&s;y I have mentioned was, however, natural; and betrayed a &s;ecret opinion, that the &s;ubjection in which they were held was more than we could expect them always to endure. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, all po&s;&s;ible care &s;hould have been taken to give them no rea&s;on for di&s;content; and to pre&s;erve them in &s;ubjection, by keeping in that line of conduct to which cu&s;tom had reconciled them, or at lea&s;t never deviating from it, except with great caution; and particularly, by avoiding all direct attacks on their property and legi&s;lations. Had we done this, the different intere&s;ts of &s;o many &s;tates &s;cattered over a va&s;t continent, joined to our own prudence and moderation, would have enabled us to maintain them in dependence for ages to come.&mdash;But in&s;tead of this, how have we acted?&mdash;It is in truth too evident, that our whole conduct, in&s;tead of being directed by that &s;ound policy and fore&s;ight which in &s;uch circum&s;tances were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, has been nothing (to &s;ay the be&s;t of it) but a &s;eries of the blinde&s;t rigour followed by retractation; of violence followed by conce&s;&s;ion; of mi&s;take, weakne&s;s and incon&s;i&s;tency.&mdash;A recital of a few facts, within every body's recollection, will fully prove this.</P>
<P>In the 6th of <HI>George the Second,</HI> an act was pa&s;&s;ed for impo|&s;ing certain duties on all foreign &s;pirits, mola&s;&s;es and &s;ugars imported into the plantations. In this act, the duties impo&s;ed are &s;aid to be GIVEN and GRANTED by the Parliament to the King; and this is the fir&s;t <HI>American</HI> act in which the&s;e words have been u&s;ed. But notwith&s;tanding this, as the act had the appearance of being only a regulation of trade, the colonies &s;ubmitted to it; and a &s;mall direct revenue was drawn by it from them.&mdash;In the 4th of the pre&s;ent reign, many alterations were made in this act, with the declared purpo&s;e of making provi&s;ion for rai&s;ing a revenue in America. This alarmed the Colonies; and produced di&s;contents and remon|&s;trances,
<PB N="36" REF="015032_0036_0F9550887817E4D0">
which might have convinced our rulers that this was tender ground, on which it became them to tread very gently. &mdash;There is, however, no rea&s;on to doubt but in time they would have &s;unk into a quiet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to this revenue act, as being at wor&s;t only the exerci&s;e of a power which then they &s;eem not to have thought much of conte&s;ting; I mean, the power of taxing them EXTERNALLY.&mdash;But before they had time to cool, a wor&s;e provocation was given them; and the STAMP ACT was pa&s;&s;ed. This being an attempt to tax them INTERNALLY; and a direct artack on their property, by a power which would not &s;uffer it&s;elf to be que&s;tioned; which ea&s;ed <HI>it&s;elf</HI> by loading <HI>them</HI>; and to which it was im|po&s;&s;ible to fix any bounds; they were thrown at once, from one end of the continent to the other, into re&s;i&s;tance and rage. &mdash;Government, dreading the con&s;equences, gave way; and the Parliament (upon a change of mini&s;try) repealed the <HI>Stamp-Act,</HI> without requiring from them any recognition of its authority, or doing any more to pre&s;erve its dignity, than a&s;&s;erting, by the declaratory law, that it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of full power and authority to make laws to bind them in all ca&s;es whatever.&mdash;Upon this, peace was re&s;tored; and, had no farther attempts of the &s;ame kind been made, they would un|doubtedly have &s;uffered us (as the people of <HI>Ireland</HI> have done) to enjoy our declaratory law. They would have recovered their former habits of &s;ubjection; and our connexion with them might have continued an increa&s;ing &s;ource of our wealth and glory.&mdash;But the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m and avarice always blind and re&s;tle&s;s, &s;oon broke forth again. The &s;cheme for drawing a revenue from <HI>America,</HI> by parliamentary taxation, was re&s;umed; and in a little more than a year after the repeal of the <HI>Stamp-Act,</HI> when all was peace, a third act was pa&s;&s;ed, impo&s;ing duties payable in <HI>America</HI> on tea, paper, gla&s;s, pain|ters colours, &amp;c.&mdash;This, as might have been expected, re|vived all the former heats; and the Empire was a &s;econd time threatened with the mo&s;t dangerous commotions.&mdash;Govern|ment receded again; and the Parliament (under another change of mini&s;try) repealed all the obnoxious duties, EXCEPT that upon tea. This exception was made in order to main|tain a &s;hew of dignity. But it was, in reality, &s;acrificing &s;afety to pride; and leaving a &s;plinter in the wound to pro|duce a gangrene.&mdash;For &s;ome time, however, this relaxation an&s;wered its intended purpo&s;es. Our commercial intercour&s;e

<P>The <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> company having fallen under difficulties, partly in con&s;equence of the lo&s;s of the <HI>American</HI> market for tea, a &s;cheme was formed for a&s;&s;i&s;ting them by an attempt to recover that market. With this view an act was pa&s;&s;ed to enable them to export their tea to <HI>America</HI> free of all duties here, and &s;ubject only to 3d. per pound duty, payable in <HI>America.</HI> By this expedient they were enabled to offer it at a low price; and it was expected the con&s;equence would prove that the Colonies would be tempted by it; a precedent gained for taxing them, and at the &s;ame time the company relieved. Ships were, therefore, fitted out; and large cargoes &s;ent. The &s;nare was too gro&s;s to e&s;cape the notice of the Colonies. They &s;aw it, and &s;purned at it. They refu&s;ed to admit the tea; and at BOSTON &s;ome per&s;ons in di&s;gui&s;e buried it in the &s;ea.&mdash;Had our governors in this ca&s;e &s;atisfied them&s;elves with requiring a compen&s;ation from the province for the damage done, there is no doubt but it would have been granted. Or had they proceeded no farther in the infliction of puni&s;h|ment, than &s;topping up the port and de&s;troying the trade of Bo&s;ton, till compen&s;ation was made, the province might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ubmitted, and a &s;ufficient &s;aving would have been gained for the honour of the nation. But having hi|therto proceeded without wi&s;dom, they ob&s;erved now no bounds in their re&s;entment. To the Bo&s;ton port bill was added a bill which de&s;troyed the chartered government of the province; a bill which withdrew from the juri&s;diction of the province, per&s;ons who in particular ca&s;es &s;hould commit mur|der; and the <HI>Quebec</HI> bill. At the &s;ame time a &s;trong body of troops was &s;tationed as <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to enforce obedience to the&s;e bills.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix.</NOTE> All who knew any thing of the temper of the Colonies &s;aw that the effect of all &s;udden accumulation of vengeance, would probably be not intimidating but exa&s;perating them, and driving them into a general revolt.

<PB N="38" REF="015032_0038_0F955089F4FD79B8">
a few factious men; that the majority of the people would take the &s;ide of government, as &s;oon as they &s;aw a force among them capable of &s;upporting them; that, at wor&s;t, the Colonies in general would never make a common cau&s;e with the province; and that, the i&s;&s;ue would prove, in a few months, order, tranquility, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Every one of the&s;e apprehen&s;ions was fal&s;ified by the event that followed.</P>
<P>When the bills I have mentioned came to be carried into execution, the whole Province was thrown into confu&s;ion. Their courts of ju&s;tice were &s;hut up, and all government was di&s;&s;olved. The commander in chief found it nece&s;&s;ary to fortify him&s;elf in BOSTON; and the other Colonies imme|diately re&s;olved to make a common cau&s;e with this Colony.</P>
<P>So &s;trangely mi&s;informed were our mini&s;ters, that this was all a &s;urpri&s;e upon them. They took fright, therefore; and once more made an effort to retreat; but indeed the mo&s;t ungracious one that can be well imagined. A propo&s;al was &s;ent to the Colonies, called Conciliatory; and the &s;ub&s;tance of which was, that if any of them would rai&s;e &s;uch &s;ums as &s;hould be demanded of them by taxing them&s;elves, the Par|liament would forbear to tax them.&mdash;It will be &s;carcely believed, hereafter, that &s;uch a propo&s;al could be thought conciliatory. It was only telling them;
<Q>if you will tax your&s;elves BY OUR ORDER, we will &s;ave our&s;elves the trou|ble of taxing you.</Q>&mdash;They received the propo&s;al as an in&s;ult; and rejected it with di&s;dain.</P>
<P>At the time this conce&s;&s;ion was tran&s;mitted to <HI>America,</HI> open ho&s;tilities were not begun. In the &s;word our mini&s;ters thought they had &s;till a re&s;ource which would immediately &s;ettle all di&s;putes. They con&s;idered the people of <HI>New Eng|land</HI> as nothing but a mob, who would be &s;oon routed and forced into obedience. It was even believed, that a few thou&s;ands of our army might march through all <HI>America,</HI> and make all quiet wherever they went. Under this conviction our mini&s;ters did not dread urging the Province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ett's-Bay</HI> into rebellion, by ordering their army to &s;eize their &s;tores, and to take up &s;ome of their leading men.&mdash;The attempt was made.&mdash;The people fled immediately to arms, and repelled the attack.&mdash;A con&s;iderable part of the flower of the Briti&s;h army has been de&s;troyed.&mdash;Some of our be&s;t Generals, and the brave&s;t of our troops, are now di&s;gracefully and mi&s;erably impri&s;oned in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI>&mdash;A horrid civil war is commenced:&mdash;And the empire is di&s;tracted and convul&s;ed.</P>

<P>In tho&s;e times our Colonies, foregoing every advantage which they might derive from trading with foreign nations, con&s;ented to &s;end only to us whatever it was for our intere&s;t to receive from them; and to receive only from us whatever it was for our intere&s;t to &s;end to them. They gave up the power of making &s;umptuary laws, and expo&s;ed them&s;elves to all the evils of an increa&s;ing and wa&s;teful luxury, becau&s;e we were benefited by vending among them the materials of it. The iron with which providence had ble&s;&s;ed their country, they were required by laws, in which they acquie&s;ced, to tran&s;port hither, that our people might be maintained by working it for them into nails, ploughs, axes, &amp;c. And, in &s;everal in&s;tances, even one Colony was not allowed to &s;upply any neighbouring Colonies with commodities, which could be conveyed to them from hence.&mdash;But they yielded much farther. They con&s;ented that we &s;hould have the appointment of one branch of their legi&s;lature. By recognizing as their King, a King re&s;ident among us and under our influence, they gave us a negative on all their laws. By allowing an appeal to us in their civil di&s;|putes, they gave us likewi&s;e the ultimate determination of all civil cau&s;es among them.&mdash;In &s;hort. They allowed us every power we could de&s;ire, except that of taxing them, and inter|fering in their internal legi&s;lations: And they had admitted precedents which, even in the&s;e in&s;tances, gave us no incon|&s;iderable authority over them. By purcha&s;ing our goods they paid our taxes; and, by allowing us to regulate their trade in any manner we thought mo&s;t for our advantage, they enriched our merchants, and helped us to bear our growing burdens. They fought our battles with us. They gloried in their re|lation to us. All their gains centered among us; and they always &s;poke of this country and looked to it as their home.</P>

<P><PB N="41" REF="015032_0041_0F95508D9935A0E8">Our American Colonies, particularly the Northern ones, have been for &s;ome time in the very happie&s;t &s;tate of &s;ociety; or, in that middle &s;tate of civilization, between its fir&s;t rude and its la&s;t refined and corrupt &s;tate.

<P>With the population of the Colonies has increa&s;ed their trade; but much fa&s;ter on account of the gradual introduction of luxury among them.&mdash;In 1723 the exports to <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> were 16,000 l.&mdash;In 1742 they were 75,295 l.&mdash;In 1757 they were increa&s;ed to 268,426 l. and in 1773 to half a million.</P>
<P>The exports to all the Colonies in 1744 were 640,114 l.&mdash; In 1758, they were increa&s;ed to 1,832,948 l. and in 1773, to three millions. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke (in his excellent and admirable Speech on moving his re&s;olutions for conciliation with the Colonies.

<P><PB N="42" REF="015032_0042_0F95508DBA7FCCB0">This trade, it &s;hould be con&s;idered, was not only thus an increa&s;ing trade; but it was a trade in which we had no rivals; a trade certain, con&s;tant, and uninterrupted; and which, by the &s;hipping employed in it, and the naval &s;tores &s;upplied by it, contributed greatly to the &s;upport of that navy which is our chief national &s;trength.&mdash; Viewed in the&s;e lights it was an object un&s;peakably important.

<P>This ine&s;timable prize, and all the advantages connected with <HI>America,</HI> we are now throwing away. Experience alone can &s;hew what calamities mu&s;t follow.

<P>On this occa&s;ion, particular attention &s;hould be given to the pre&s;ent SINGULAR &s;ituation of this kingdom. This is a circum&s;tance of the utmo&s;t importance; and as I am afraid it is not much con&s;idered, I will beg leave to give a di&s;tinct account of it.</P>
<P>At the REVOLUTION, the <HI>&s;pecie</HI> of the kingdom amounted according to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Davenant's works, collected and revi&s;ed by Sir Charles Whitworth, Vol. 1. Page 363, &amp;c. 443. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Davenant</HI>'s account, to eighteen millions and a half.&mdash;From the ACCESSION to the year 1772, there were coined at the mint, near 29 millions of gold; and in ten years only of this time, or from January 1759 to January
<PB N="43" REF="015032_0043_0F95508E75E604F8">
1769, there were coined eight millions and a half. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Con&s;iderations on Money, Bullion, &amp;c. Page 2 and 11.</NOTE> But it has appeared lately, that the gold &s;pecie now left in the king|dom is no more than about twelve millions and a half.&mdash; Not &s;o much as half a million of <HI>Silver &s;pecie</HI> has been coined the&s;e &s;ixty years; and it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the quantity of it now in circulation exceeds two or three millions. The whole &s;pecie of the kingdom, therefore, is probably at this time about <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Or nearly the &s;ame that it was in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s time. See Dr. Davenant's works, Vol. 1. Page 365.</NOTE> fourteen or fifteen millions. Of this &s;everal millions mu&s;t be hoarded at the <HI>Bank.</HI>&mdash;Our circulating <HI>&s;pecie,</HI> therefore, appears to be greatly decrea&s;ed. But our wealth, or the quantity of money in the kingdom, is greatly increa&s;ed. This is paper to a va&s;t amount, i&s;&s;ued in almo&s;t every corner of the kingdom; and, particularly, by the BANK of ENGLAND. While this paper maintains its credit it an&s;wers all the pur|po&s;es of &s;pecie, and is in all re&s;pects the &s;ame with money.</P>
<P>Specie repre&s;ents &s;ome real value in goods or commodities. On the contrary; paper repre&s;ents immediately nothing but &s;pecie. It is a promi&s;e or obligation, which the emitter brings him&s;elf under to pay a given &s;um in coin; and it owes its cur|rency to the credit of the emitter; or to an opinion that he is able to make good his engagement; and that the &s;um &s;pecified may be received upon being demanded.&mdash;Paper, therefore, re|pre&s;ents coin; and coin repre&s;ents real value. That is, the one is a <HI>&s;ign</HI> of wealth. The other is the <HI>&s;ign</HI> of that <HI>&s;ign.</HI>&mdash;But farther. Coin is an <HI>univer&s;al</HI> &s;ign of wealth, and will procure it every where. It will bear any alarm, and &s;tand any &s;hock.&mdash;On the contrary. Paper, owing its currency to opinion, has only a local and imaginary value. It can &s;tand no &s;hock. It is de&s;troyed by the approach of danger; or even the <HI>&s;u&s;picion</HI> of danger.</P>
<P>In &s;hort. Coin is the ba&s;is of our paper-credit; and were it either all de&s;troyed, or were only the quantity of it reduced beyond a certain limit, the paper circulation of the kingdom would &s;ink at once. But, were our paper de&s;troyed, the coin would not only remain, but ri&s;e in value, in proportion to the quantity of paper de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>From this account it follows, that as far as, in any circum|&s;tances, &s;pecie is not to be procured in exchange for paper, it repre&s;ents <HI>nothing,</HI> and is worth <HI>nothing.</HI>&mdash;The &s;pecie of this kingdom is incon&s;iderable, compared with the amount of the
<PB N="44" REF="015032_0044_0F95508F35677E58">
paper circulating in it. This is generally believed; and, there|fore, it is natural to enquire how its currency is &s;upported.&mdash; The an&s;wer is ea&s;y. It is &s;upported in the &s;ame manner with all other bubbles. Were all to demand &s;pecie in exchange for their notes, payment could not be made; but, at the &s;ame time that this is known, every one tru&s;ts, that no alarm producing &s;uch a demand will happen, while he holds the paper he is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of; and that if it &s;hould happen, he will &s;tand a chance for being fir&s;t paid; and this makes him ea&s;y. And it al&s;o makes all with whom he traffics ea&s;y.&mdash;But let any events happen which threaten danger; and every one will become diffident. A run will take place, and a bankruptcy follow.</P>
<P>This is an account of what <HI>has</HI> often happened in <HI>private</HI> credit. And it is al&s;o an account of what <HI>will</HI> (if no change of mea&s;ures takes place) happen &s;ome time or other in <HI>public</HI> credit. The de&s;cription I have given of our paper-circulation implies, that nothing can be more delicate or hazardous. It is an immen&s;e fabrick, with its head in the clouds, that is con|tinually trembling with every adver&s;e bla&s;t and every fluctua|tion of trade; and which, like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabrick of a vi&s;ion, may in a moment vani&s;h, and leave no wreck behind.&mdash;The de&s;truction of a few books at the <HI>Bank</HI>; an improvement in the art of forgery; the landing of a body of <HI>French</HI> troops on our coa&s;ts; in&s;urrections threatning a revolution in govern|ment; or any events that &s;hould produce a general panic, however groundle&s;s, would at once annihilate it, and leave us without any other medium of traffic, than a quantity of <HI>&s;pecie</HI> &s;carcely equal in amount to the money now drawn from the public by the taxes. It would, therefore, become impo&s;&s;ible to pay the taxes. The revenue would fail. Near one hun|dred and forty millions of property would be de&s;troyed. The whole frame of government would fall to pieces; and a &s;tate of nature would take place.&mdash;What a dreadful &s;ituation? It has never had a parallel among mankind; except at one time in <HI>France</HI> after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Royal <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi</HI> Bank. In 1720 this Bank broke; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sir James Steuart's Enquiry into the Principles of political Oeconomy, Vol. II. Book 4.

This danger is created chiefly by the national debt. High taxes are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport a great public debt; and a large &s;upply of ca&s;h is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport high taxes. This ca&s;h we owe to our paper; and, in proportion to our paper, mu&s;t be the pro|ductivene&s;s of our taxes.&mdash;King William's wars drained the kingdom of its &s;pecie. This &s;unk the revenue, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed government. In 1694 the BANK was e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the kingdom was provided with a &s;ub&s;titute for &s;pecie. The taxes became again productive. The revenue ro&s;e; and govern|ment was relieved.&mdash;Ever &s;ince that period our paper and taxes have been increa&s;ing together, and &s;upporting one ano|ther; and one rea&s;on, undoubtedly, of the late increa&s;e in the productivene&s;s of our taxes has been the increa&s;e of our paper.</P>
<P>Was there no public debt, there would be no occa&s;ion for half the pre&s;ent taxes. Our paper-circulation might be re|duced. The balance of trade would turn in our favour. Specie would flow in upon us.

But they al&s;o do great harm; and if their emi&s;&s;ions are not re&s;trained, and conducted with great wi&s;dom, they may prove the mo&s;t pernicious of all in&s;titutions; not only, by &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>fictitious</HI> for <HI>real</HI> wealth; by increa&s;ing luxury; by rai&s;ing the prices of provi&s;ions; by concealing an un|favourable balance of trade; and by rendering a kingdom incapable of bearing any <HI>internal</HI> tumults or <HI>external</HI> attacks, without the danger of a dreadful convul&s;ion: But, particu|larly, by becoming in&s;truments in the hands of mini&s;ters of &s;tate to increa&s;e their influence, to le&s;&s;en their dependence on the people, and to keep up a delu&s;ive &s;hew of public pro&s;perity, when perhaps, ruin may be near. There is, in truth, nothing that a government may not do with &s;uch a mine at its com|mand as a public Bank, while it can maintain its credit; nor, therefore, is there any thing more likely to be IMPROPERLY and DANGEROUSLY u&s;ed.&mdash;But to return to what may be more applicable to our &s;tate at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Among the cau&s;es that may produce a failure of paper-credit, there are two which the pre&s;ent quarrel with <HI>America</HI> calls upon us particularly to con&s;ider.&mdash;The fir&s;t is,
<Q>An unfavorable balance of trade.</Q>
This, in proportion to the degree in which it takes place, mu&s;t turn the cour&s;e of foreign exchange again&s;t us; rai&s;e the price of bullion; and carry off our &s;pecie. The danger to which this would expo&s;e us is obvious; and it has been much increa&s;ed by the new coinage of the gold &s;pecie which begun in 1772. Before this coinage, the greate&s;t part of our gold coin being light, but the &s;ame in currency, as if it had been heavy, always remained in the kingdom. But, being now full weight, whenever a wrong balance of foreign trade alters the cour&s;e of exchange, and gold in <HI>coin</HI> becomes of le&s;s value than in <HI>bullion,</HI> there is rea&s;on to fear, that it will be melted down in &s;uch great quantities, and exported &s;o fa&s;t, as in a little time to leave none behind; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Lowndes</HI> in the di&s;pute between him and Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> contended for a re|duction of the &s;tandard &s;ilver. One of his rea&s;ons was, that it would render the &s;ilver-coin more commen&s;urate to the wants of the nation; and CHECK HAZARDOUS PAPER-CREDIT. &mdash;Mr. CONDUIT&punc; Sir ISAAC NEWTON's &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the mint, has propo&s;ed, in direct contradiction to the laws now in being, that all the bullion imported into the kingdom &s;hould be carried into the mint to be coined; and only coin allowed to be exported. "The height," he &s;ays,
<Q>of paper-credit is the &s;tronge&s;t argument for trying this and <HI>every other</HI> method that is likely to increa&s;e the coinage. For whil&s;t Paper-credit does in a great mea&s;ure the bu&s;ine&s;s of money at home, Merchants and Bankers are not under a nece&s;&s;ity, as they were formerly, of coining a quantity of &s;pecie for their home trade; and as Paper-credit brings money to the Mer|chants to be exported, the money may go away in&s;en&s;ibly, and NOT BE MISSED TILL IT BE TOO LATE: And where Paper-credit is large and increa&s;ing, if the money be exported and the coinage decrea&s;e, THAT CREDIT MAY SINK AT ONCE; for want of a proportionable quantity of <HI>Specie,</HI> which alone can &s;upport it in a time of di&s;tre&s;s.</Q>

which mu&s;t prove, that the whole &s;uper&s;tructure of paper-credit, now &s;upported by it, will break down.&mdash;The only remedy, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, is an increa&s;e of coinage at the mint. But this will operate too &s;lowly; and by rai&s;ing the price of bul|lion, will only increa&s;e the evil.&mdash;It is the <HI>Bank</HI> that at &s;uch a time mu&s;t be the immediate &s;ufferer: For it is from thence that tho&s;e who want coin for any purpo&s;e will always draw it.</P>
<P>For many years before 1772, the price of gold in <HI>bullion</HI> had been, from 2 to 3 or 4 per cent, higher than in <HI>coin.</HI> This was a temptation to melt down and export the coin, which could not be re&s;i&s;ted. Hence aro&s;e a demand for it on the BANK; and, con&s;equently, the nece&s;&s;ity of purcha&s;ing bullion at a lo&s;s for a new coinage. But the more coin the Bank procured in this way, the lower its price became in compari&s;on with that of bullion, and the fa&s;ter it vanished; and, con&s;e|quently, the more nece&s;&s;ary it became to coin again, and the greater lo&s;s fell upon the Bank.&mdash;Had things continued much longer in this train, the con&s;equences might have proved very &s;erious. I am by no means &s;ufficiently informed to be able to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;es which produced the change that happened in 1772. But, without doubt, the &s;tate of things that took place before that year mu&s;t be expected to return. The fluctuations of trade, in its be&s;t &s;tate, render this unavoidable. But the conte&s;t with our Colonies has a tendency to bring it on &s;oon; and to increa&s;e un&s;peakably the di&s;tre&s;s attending it.</P>
<P>All know that the balance of trade with them is greatly in our favour; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">According to the accounts of the exports to, and imports from the North-Ame|rican Colonies, laid before Parliament; the balance in our favour appears to have been, for 11 years before 1774, near <HI>a million and a half</HI> annually.</NOTE> and that this balance is paid partly by direct re|mittances of bullion; and partly by circuitous remittances through <HI>Spain, Portugal, Italy,</HI> &amp;c. which dimini&s;h the ba|lance again&s;t us with the&s;e countries.&mdash;During the la&s;t year they have been employed in paying their debts, without adding to them; and their exportations and remittances for that

purpo&s;e have contributed to render the general balance of trade more favourable to us, and, al&s;o, (in conjunction with the late operations of the Bank) to keep up our funds. The&s;e remit|tances are now cea&s;ed; and a year of two will determine, if this conte&s;t goes on, how far we can &s;u&s;tain &s;uch a lo&s;s without &s;uffering the con&s;equences I have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd event, ruinous to our paper-circulation, which may ari&s;e from our rupture with <HI>America,</HI> is a deficiency in the revenue. As a failure of our paper would de&s;troy the revenue, &s;o a failure of the revenue, or any con&s;iderable diminution of it, would de&s;troy our paper. The BANK is the &s;upport of our paper; and the &s;upport of the BANK is the credit of govern|ment. Its principal &s;ecurities, are a capital of near eleven millions lent to government; and money continually advanced to a va&s;t amount on the Land-tax, Sinking-fund, Exchequer-bills, Navy-bills, &amp;c. Should, therefore, deficiencies in the revenue bring government under any difficulties, all the&s;e &s;ecu|rities would lo&s;e their value, and the <HI>Bank</HI> and Government, and all private and public credit, would fall together.&mdash; Let any one here imagine, what would probably follow, were it but &s;u&s;pected by the public in general, that the taxes were &s;o fallen, as not to produce enough to pay the intere&s;t of the pub|lic debts, be&s;ides bearing the <HI>ordinary</HI> expences of the nation; and that, in order to &s;upply the deficiency and to hide the ca|lamity, it had been nece&s;&s;ary in any one year to anticipate the taxes, and to borrow of the Bank.&mdash;In &s;uch circum&s;tances I can &s;carcely doubt, but an alarm would &s;pread of the mo&s;t dangerous tendency.&mdash;The next foreign war, &s;hould it prove <HI>half</HI> as expen&s;ive as the la&s;t, will probably occa&s;ion &s;uch a defi|ciency; and bring our affairs to that cri&s;is towards which they have been long tending.&mdash;But the war with <HI>America</HI> has a greater tendency to do this; and the rea&s;on is, that it affects our re&s;ources more; and is attended more with the danger of internal di&s;turbances.</P>
<P>Some have made the proportion of our trade depending on <HI>North-America</HI> to be near ONE HALF. A moderate compu|tation makes it a THIRD. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the &s;ub&s;tance of the evidence on the petition pre&s;ented by the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Planters and Merchants to the Hou&s;e of Commons, as it was introduced to the BAR, and &s;ummed up by Mr. GLOVER.</NOTE> Let it, however be &s;uppo&s;ed to be only a FOURTH.

<P>In order to give a clearer view of this &s;ubject, I will in an Appendix, &s;tate particularly the national expenditure and in|come for ten years, from 1764 to 1774.

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the Honour of the Nation, as affected by the War with <HI>America.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONE of the pleas for continuing the conte&s;t with <HI>America</HI> is, <Q>That our honor is engaged; and that we cannot recede without the mo&s;t humiliating conce&s;&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to this, it is proper to ob&s;erve, that a di&s;tinc|tion &s;hould be made between the nation and its rulers. It is melancholy that there &s;hould be ever any rea&s;on for making &s;uch a di&s;tinction. A government is, or ought to be, nothing but an in&s;titution for collecting and for carrying into execu|tion the will of the people. But &s;o far is this from being in general the fact, that the mea&s;ures of government, and the &s;en&s;e of the people, are &s;ometimes in direct oppo&s;ition to one another; nor does it <HI>often</HI> happen that any certain conclu&s;ion can be drawn from the one to the other.&mdash;I will not pretend to determine, whether, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the di&s;honour attending a retreat would belong to the nation at large, or only to the per&s;ons in power who guide its affairs. Let it be granted, though, probably far from true, that the majority of the kingdom favour the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures. No good argument could be drawn from hence again&s;t receding. The di&s;grace to which a kingdom mu&s;t &s;ubmit by making conce&s;&s;ions, is nothing to that of being the aggre&s;&s;ors in an unrighteous quar|rel; and dignity, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, con&s;i&s;ts in retracting freely, &s;peedily, and magnanimou&s;ly.&mdash;For, (to adopt, on this occa&s;ion, words which I have heard applied to this very pur|po&s;e, in a great a&s;&s;embly, by a peer to whom this kingdom has often looked as its deliverer, and who&s;e ill &s;tate of health at this awful moment of public danger every friend to <HI>Britain</HI> mu&s;t deplore) to adopt, I &s;ay, the words of this great man&mdash;
<Q>RECTITUDE IS DIGNITY. OPPRESSION ONLY IS MEANNESS; AND JUSTICE, HONOUR.</Q></P>
<P>I will add, that PRUDENCE, no le&s;s than HONOUR, requires us to retract.

on a kingdom already too much di&s;honoured.&mdash;Let the reader think here what we are doing.&mdash;A nation, once the protec|tor of Liberty in di&s;tant countries, and the &s;courge of tyranny, changed into an enemy to Liberty, and engaged in endeavour|ing to reduce to &s;ervitude its own brethren.&mdash;A great and enlightened nation, not content with a controuling power over millions of people which gave it every rea&s;onable advan|tage, in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;uch a &s;upremacy over them as would leave them nothing they could call their own, and carrying de&s;olation and death among them for di&s;puting it.&mdash;What can be more ignominious?&mdash;How have we felt for the brave <HI>Cor|&s;icans,</HI> in their &s;truggle with the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> and afterwards with the <HI>French</HI> government? Did GENOA or FRANCE want more than an ab&s;olute command over their property and legi&s;lations; or the power of binding them in all ca&s;es what&s;oever?&mdash; The <HI>Cor&s;icans</HI> had been &s;ubject to the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI>; but finding it difficult to keep them in &s;ubjection, they CEDED them to the <HI>French.</HI>&mdash; All &s;uch ce&s;&s;ions of one people to another are di&s;graceful to human nature. But if our claims are ju&s;t, may not we al&s;o, if we plea&s;e, CEDE the Colonies to <HI>France?</HI> &mdash;There is, in truth, no other difference between the&s;e two ca&s;es than that the <HI>Cor&s;icans</HI> were not de&s;cended from the peo|ple who governed them, but that the <HI>Americans</HI> are.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome who &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible, that the authority of one country over another, cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;ervitude of one country to another; and that unle&s;s different communities, as well as different parts of the &s;ame community, are united by an equal repre&s;entation, all &s;uch authority is incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of Civil Liberty.

<P>Let him, likewi&s;e, read the account of the &s;ocial war among the Romans. The allied &s;tates of <HI>Italy</HI> had fought the battles of <HI>Rome,</HI> and contributed by their valour and trea&s;ure to its conque&s;ts and grandeur.

The Romans, di&s;daining to make tho&s;e their <HI>fellow-citizens,</HI> whom they had always looked upon as their <HI>&s;ubjects,</HI> would not comply; and a war followed, which ended in the ruin of the Roman Republic. The feelings of every <HI>Briton</HI> in this ca&s;e mu&s;t force him to approve the conduct of the Allies, and to condemn the proud and ungrateful Romans.</P>
<P>But not only is the pre&s;ent conte&s;t with <HI>America</HI> thus di&s;|graceful to us, becau&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent with our own feelings in &s;imilar ca&s;es; but al&s;o becau&s;e condemned our own practice in former times.

<P>But farther. This war is di&s;graceful on account of the per&s;uation which led to it, and under which it has been under|taken. The general cry was la&s;t winter, that the people of NEW-ENGLAND were a body of cowards, who would at once be tumbled into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by a ho&s;tile look from our troops.

<P>Again. The manner in which this war has been hitherto conducted, renders it &s;till more di&s;graceful.&mdash;Engli&s;h valour being thought in&s;ufficient to &s;ubdue the Colonies, the law and religion of <HI>France</HI> were e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Canada,</HI> on purpo&s;e to obtain the power of bringing upon them from thence an army of <HI>French Papi&s;ts.</HI> The wild <HI>Indians</HI> and their own Slaves have been in&s;tigated to attack them; and attempts have been made to gain the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a large body of Ru&s;&s;ians.&mdash; With like views, <HI>German</HI> troops have been hired; and the defence of our Forts and Garri&s;ons tru&s;ted in their hands.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;aid &s;o much of the war with America, and par|ticularly of the danger with which it threatens us, it may be expected that I &s;hould propo&s;e &s;ome method of e&s;cap|ing from this danger and of re&s;toring this once happy Empire to a &s;tate of peace and &s;ecurity.&mdash;Various plans of pacification have been propo&s;ed; and &s;ome of them by per&s;ons &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their rank and merit, as to be above my applau&s;e. But till there is more of a di&s;po&s;ition to attend to &s;uch plans; they cannot, I am afraid, be of any great &s;ervice. And there is too much rea&s;on to apprehend, that nothing but calamity will bring us to repentance and wi&s;dom.&mdash;In order, how|ever, to complete my de&s;ign in the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I will take the liberty to lay before the public the following &s;ketch of one of the plans ju&s;t referred to, as it was opened before the holidays to the hou&s;e of Lords by the <HI>Earl of Shelburne</HI>; who while he held the &s;eals of the Southern Department, with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Colonies annexed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their confidence, without ever compromi&s;ing the authority of this country; a confidence which di&s;covered it&s;elf by peace among them&s;elves, and duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Mother-country. I hope I &s;hall not take an unwarrantable liberty, if, on this occa&s;ion, I u&s;e his Lord&s;hip's own words, as nearly as I have been able to collect them.</P>

They offer a relaxation of the authority of this country, in points to which the Colonies have always con&s;ented, and by which we are great gainers; at the &s;ame time, that, with a rigour which hazards the Empire, we are maintaining its authority in points to which they will never con&s;ent; and by which nothing can be gained.</NOTE> or a barren metaphy|&s;ical chimaera.&mdash;How long the&s;e ends may continue attainable, no man can tell.&mdash;But if no words are to be relied on except &s;uch as make again&s;t the Colonies&mdash;If nothing is acceptable, except what is attainable by force; it only remains to apply, what has been &s;o often remarked of unhappy periods,&mdash;<HI>Quos deus vult, &amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The&s;e are &s;entiments and propo&s;als of the la&s;t importance; and I am very happy in being able to give them to the public from &s;o re&s;pectable an authority, as that of the di&s;tingui&s;hed Peer I have mentioned; to whom, I know, this kingdom, as well as America, is much indebted for his zeal to promote tho&s;e grand public points on which the pre&s;ervation of Liberty among us depends; and for the firm oppo&s;ition which, jointly with many others (Noblemen and Commoners of the fir&s;t cha|racter and abilities,) he has made to the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Had &s;uch a plan as that now propo&s;ed been adopted a few months ago, I have little doubt but that a pacification would have taken place, on terms highly advantageous to this king|dom.&mdash;In particular. It is probable, that the Colonies would have con&s;ented to grant an annual &s;upply, which, in|crea&s;ed by a &s;aving of the money now &s;pent in maintaining troops among them, and by contributions which might have been gained from other parts of the Empire, would have formed a fund con&s;iderable enough, if unalienably applied, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix.</NOTE> to redeem
<PB N="62" REF="015032_0062_0F9550FD8AB224D8">
the greate&s;t part of the public debt; in con&s;equence of which, agreeable to Lord Shelburne's ideas, &s;ome of our wor&s;t taxes might be taken off, and the Colonies would receive our manu|factures cheaper; our paper-currency might be re&s;trained; our whole force would be free to meet at any time foreign danger; the influence of the Crown would be reduced; our Parliament would become more independent; and the kingdom might, perhaps, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to a &s;ituation of permanent &s;afety and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>To conclude.&mdash; An important revolution in affairs of this kingdom &s;eems to be approaching. If ruin is not to be our lot, all that has been lately done mu&s;t be undone, and new mea&s;ures adopted. At that period, an opportunity (never per|haps to be recovered, if lo&s;t) will offer it&s;elf for &s;erving e&s;&s;en|tially <HI>this country,</HI> as well as <HI>America</HI>; by putting the national debt into a <HI>fixed</HI> cour&s;e of payment; by &s;ubjecting to new re|gulations, the admini&s;tration of the finances; and e&s;tabli&s;hing mea&s;ures for exterminating corruption and re&s;toring the con&s;ti|tution&mdash;For my own part; if this is not to be the con&s;equence of any future changes in the mini&s;try, and the &s;y&s;tem of corruption, lately &s;o much improved, is to go on; I think it totally indifferent to the kingdom who are <HI>in,</HI> or who are <HI>out</HI> of power.</P>

<P>I have given the <HI>Navy Debt</HI> as it was about a year ago. It mu&s;t be now greatly increa&s;ed.&mdash;The <HI>Civil Li&s;t Debt</HI> has been given by gue&s;s. It is generally acknowledged not to be le&s;s than the &s;um I have &s;pecified; and it is al&s;o expected, that the Civil Li&s;t income will be rai&s;ed to 900,000 l. <HI>per annum.</HI>&mdash;In 1769 the &s;um of 513,511 l. was granted by parliament towards di&s;|charging the arrears and debts then due on the Civil Li&s;t.</P>
<P>By an act of the fir&s;t of George II. the Civil Li&s;t was made up 800,000 l. whenever, in any year, the duties and revenues appropriated to it fell &s;hort of that &s;um. The clear produce of the&s;e duties for 33 years, or from Mid&s;ummer 1727, to Mid&s;um|mer 1760, was, according to a particular account in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, 26,182,981 l. 17s. 6d. or 795,242 l. <HI>per ann.</HI> They fell &s;hort, therefore, talking one year with another, <HI>more</HI> than they exceeded, &mdash;In 1747, they had been deficient for &s;even years together; and the whole deficiency amounted to 456,733 l. 16 s.&mdash;which, in conformity to the act I have mentioned, was made good to his maje&s;ty out of the &s;upplies for that year.&mdash;In 1729 al&s;o, 117.000 l. was granted out of the &s;upplies for the like rea&s;on.&mdash; This is all the money, received by his late maje&s;ty from parliament, towards &s;upporting his hou&s;hold and the dignity of his civil government; or 810,749 <HI>per ann.</HI>&mdash;I have thought proper to &s;tate this matter &s;o particularly here; becau&s;e accounts gro&s;sly wrong have been given of it.</P>
<P>The amount of the National Debt, it has appeared, was la&s;t year 137 millions.&mdash;The great deficiencies of la&s;t year, added to the extraordinary expences of the pre&s;ent year, will increa&s;e this debt con&s;iderably.&mdash;Drawing out, embodying, and maintaining the militia in the la&s;t war, co&s;t the nation near half a million <HI>per ann.</HI> &mdash;We cannot reckon upon a le&s;s expence in doing this now.

to it, pay for foreign troops, and all the extraordinary expences of our increa&s;ed Navy and Army, tran&s;port &s;ervice, recruiting &s;ervice, ordnance, &amp;c. and it will be evident that the whole expence of this unhappy year mu&s;t be enormous.&mdash;But I expect that care will be taken to hide it, by funding as little as po&s;&s;ible, and that for this rea&s;on it will not be known in its full magnitude, till it comes to appear another year under the articles of Navy debt, extraordina|ries of the army, tran&s;port bills, ordnance debentures, &amp;c. making up a va&s;t unfunded debt which may bear down all public credit.</P>

<P>There is a <HI>third</HI> method of proving that the permanent &s;urplus of the revenue cannot exceed the &s;um now &s;tated.</P>
<P>I have learnt from the highe&s;t authority, that the national debt about a year ago, had been dimini&s;hed near 9 millions and a half &s;ince the peace in 1763; including a million of the 3 <HI>per cents</HI> di&s;|charged la&s;t year.&mdash;The money employed in making this reduction, mu&s;t have been derived from the &s;urplus of the <HI>ordinary</HI> and &s;tated revenue, added to the <HI>extraordinary</HI> receipts. The&s;e <HI>extra|ordinary</HI> receipts have con&s;i&s;ted of the following articles.&mdash; 1. The Land Tax at 4s. in the pound in 1764, 1765, and. 1771; or 1s. in the pound <HI>extraordinary</HI> for three years, making 1.300,000 &mdash;2.

<P>It mu&s;t be &s;een, that this account is imperfect, It is, however &s;ufficient to prove, that the whole money rai&s;ed DIRECTLY by the taxes, exceeds con&s;iderably ELEVEN MILLIONS. But as the
<PB N="70" REF="015032_0070_0F95510453521350">
increa&s;ed price of one commodity has a tendency to rai&s;e the price of other commodities; and as al&s;o dealers generally add more than the value of a tax to the price of a commodity, be&s;ides charging intere&s;t for the money they advance on the taxes; for the&s;e rea&s;ons, it &s;eems certain, that the taxes have an INDIRECT effect of great con&s;equence; and that a larger &s;um is drawn by them from the public, than their <HI>gro&s;s</HI> produce.&mdash;It is farther to be con&s;idered, that many of the per&s;ons who are now &s;upported by collecting the taxes would have &s;upported them&s;elves by commerce or agricul|ture; and, therefore, in&s;tead of taking away from the public &s;tock, would have been employed in increa&s;ing it.&mdash;Some have reckoned that on all the&s;e accounts the expence of the taxes is <HI>doubled</HI>; but this mu&s;t be extravagant. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>quarter</HI> only added; and it will follow, that the money drawn from the public by the taxes (exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e which maintain the poor) is near 14 mil|lions <HI>per ann</HI>; a &s;um almo&s;t equal to the whole &s;pecie of the kingdom; which, therefore, had we no paper currency, would be totally inadequate to the wants of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Without all doubt &s;uch a &s;tate of things, in a great commercial nation, is mo&s;t dangerous, and frightful; but it admits of no remedy, while the public debt continues what it is.&mdash;With a view, therefore, to the quick reduction of this debt, I will throw away, after, all I have &s;aid on this &s;ubject on former occa&s;ions, the following propo&s;als.&mdash;It has appeared, that, &s;uppo&s;ing the taxes not to become le&s;s productive, and the current national expence to continue the &s;ame that it had been for ten years before 1775, a &s;urplus may be expected in the revenue of about 300,000 l. <HI>per ann.</HI> &mdash;With a &s;urplus &s;o trifling, nothing can be done; but it might be increa&s;ed, fir&s;t of all; By keeping the LAND TAX for the future at 4s. in the pound.&mdash;As rents have been almo&s;t doubled, this will not be much more to the pre&s;ent proprietors of land, than 2s. in the pound was formerly. 'Tis, therefore, equitable; and it will add to the national income near 450,000 l.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> All the money now &s;pent in maintaining troops in America might be &s;aved.&mdash;The Colonies are able to defend them&s;elves. They wi&s;h to be allowed to do it. Should they ever want the aid of our troops, they will certainly be very willing to pay us for them. Indeed I am of opinion, they will never be willing to make pence with us, without &s;tipulating that we &s;hall withdraw our troops from them. Were there any external power that claimed and exerci&s;ed a right of &s;tationing troops in this country, without our con&s;ent, we &s;hould certainly think our&s;elves entirely undone.&mdash;I will e&s;timate this &s;aving at no more than 200,000 l. <HI>per ann.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That contributions might be obtained from <HI>North America</HI> and other parts of the Briti&s;h Empire, on the principles &s;tated, from the EARL of SHELBURNE'S authority, in page 60.&mdash; I will e&s;timate this at no more than 300,000 l. <HI>per ann.</HI>&mdash;Add the <HI>Surplus</HI> now in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and the total will be 1.600,000. &mdash;In the <HI>Introduction</HI> to the third edition of the Treati&s;e on <HI>Rever&s;ionary Payments,</HI> I have explained a method of paying off with a &s;inking Fund of a million <HI>per ann.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the time of writing the introduction here referred to, about three year ago, I <HI>thought,</HI> or rather <HI>hoped,</HI> that the &s;urplus of the revenue might be taken at 900 000 l. <HI>per ann.</HI> But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the nation was then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a contribution of 400,000 l. <HI>per ann.</HI> from the Lodia Company, which has been &s;ince lo&s;t,&mdash;See the Additional Preface to the 2nd Edition <HI>of the Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the National Debt.</HI></NOTE> a hundred millions of the national debt in forty years. What then might not be done with &s;uch a Fund as this?</P>
<P>In five years 18.986,300l. will fall from an intere&s;t of 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> to 3 <HI>per cent.</HI>&mdash;Al&s;o, 4.500,000 l. 3&frac12; <HI>per cent.</HI> 1758, will fall, in &s;ix years, to an intere&s;t of 3 <HI>per cent.</HI>&mdash;The long Annuities granted in King WILLIAM'S time, amounting to 136,453 l. will, in 18 years, become mo&s;tly extinct; as will al&s;o the greater part of the Life Annuities &s;pecified in page 63.&mdash;All the&s;e &s;avings amount to more than 400,000 l. <HI>per ann.</HI> And, were they to be added to the fund as they fall in, its operations would be &s;o much accelerated, that in a few years we &s;hould &s;ee this country above all its difficulties.&mdash;Still more might be done by &s;triking off unncce&s;&s;ary places and pen&s;ions; by giving up all the means of corruption; by reducing the pay of the great officers of &s;tate; and &s;implifying the taxes&mdash;A mini&s;ter who appeared determined to carry into execution &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, would &s;oon gain the confidence of the public; endear him&s;elf to all hone&s;t men; and in time come to be ble&s;&s;ed as the Saviour of his country.&mdash;But what am I doing?&mdash;We have no &s;uch happy period before us.&mdash;Our mini&s;ters are active in pur&s;uing mea&s;ures which mu&s;t increa&s;e our burdens. A horrid civil war is begun; and it may &s;oon leave us nothing to be anxious about.</P>
