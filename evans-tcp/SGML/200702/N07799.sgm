<P>WHEN I la&s;t wrote to you and &s;aid, "that the late mea&s;ures re&s;pecting <HI>America,</HI> would not only be extremely injurious to the <HI>Colonies,</HI> but al&s;o to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>" I little thought I was entring into an engagement, which would oblige me to exceed the u&s;ual limits of a letter: but &s;ince you de&s;ire to have at large the rea&s;ons in &s;upport of this opinion, and I always think it my duty to comply with your reque&s;ts, I will endeavour in the cleare&s;t manner I can, to lay my &s;entiments before you.</P>
<P>THE <HI>American</HI> continental colonies are inhabited by per&s;ons of &s;mall fortunes, who <HI>are</HI> &s;o clo&s;ely employed in &s;ubduing a wild country, for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and who <HI>would</HI> labour under &s;uch difficulties in contending with old and populous countries, which mu&s;t exceed them in workman&s;hip and cheapne&s;s, that they have not

<P>"As the ca&s;e now &s;tands, we &s;hall &s;hew that the <HI>plantations</HI> are a &s;pring of <HI>wealth</HI> to this nation, that they <HI>work</HI> for us, that their trea|&s;ure <HI>centers all here,</HI> and that the laws have tied them falt enough to us; &s;o that it mu&s;t be through our own fault and mi&s;management, if they become independent of <HI>England.</HI>"</P>

<P>"I &s;hall &s;um up my whole remarks on our <HI>American</HI> colonies, with this ob&s;ervation, that as they are a certain annual revenue of &s;everal millions &s;terling to their Mother Country, they ought carefully to be protected, duly encouraged, and every opportunity that pre&s;ents, im|proved for their increment and advantage, as every one they can po&s;&s;ibly reap, mu&s;t at la&s;t return to us with intere&s;t."</P>

The benefit from hence is at <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> immen&s;e; but in <HI>future</HI> times when <HI>America</HI> &s;hall be more fully peopled, mu&s;t exceed with prudent management the warme&s;t wi&s;hes of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Patriot.</P>
<P>Our chief productions are provi&s;ions, naval &s;tores, furs, iron and lumber. Some few colonies yield tobac|co and indigo. Many of the&s;e commodities are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> but all that &s;he requires are

va&s;tly in&s;ufficient to pay for her manufactures which we want. The productions of &s;ome of the Southern Co|lonies may perhaps be equal to their demands, but the ca&s;e is widely different with the Northern; for in the&s;e, the importations from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> are computed to be generally more than double the value of their immediate exportations to that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE only expedient left us for making our remit|tances, is to carry on &s;ome other trade, whereby we can obtain &s;ilver and gold, which our own country does not afford. Hence it is evident, that if our taking off and paying for her manufactures, is beneficial to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the channels by which we acquire money for that purpo&s;e, ought to be indu&s;triou&s;ly kept open and uninterrupted.</P>
<P>OUR trade with <HI>Spain, Portugal</HI> and the foreign plantations in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> have chiefly an&s;wered this end, though with much difficulty, the mother country having long &s;ince drawn the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As far as regulations are requi&s;ite to confine the commerce of the colonies to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects and to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;hips; to give <HI>Great-Britain</HI> the preference in being &s;upplied with naval &s;tores, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to her &s;trength at &s;ea; with commodities nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on her woollen manu|factures, or &s;uch articles as can bear high duties upon them, and thereby make a con&s;iderable addition to the revenue; or as far as they are requi&s;ite to prevent the colonies from being &s;upplied with any thing in the place of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufactures, they may be rea&s;onable. The&s;e regulations, it is apprehended, e&s;tabli&s;h the ba&s;is of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> power; and form &s;uch a firm connection between the Mother Country and her Colonies, as will produce all the advantages &s;he ought to wi&s;h for, or that they can afford her. Any further attempt to &s;hackle <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the colonies in favour of <HI>others,</HI> or to advance the revenue in <HI>America</HI> by re&s;training its trade, is but regulating by a &s;evere exerci&s;e of power, what wants no regulation, and lo&s;ing by too much haste to gain.

<P>HOWEVER under all the&s;e re&s;traints and &s;ome others that have been impo&s;ed on us, we have not till lately been unhappy. Our &s;pirits were not depre&s;&s;ed. We apprehended no de&s;ign formed again&s;t our liberty. We for a long time enjoyed peace, and were quite free from any heavy debt, either internal or external. We had a paper currency which &s;erved as a medium of dome&s;tic commerce, and permitted us to employ all the gold and &s;ilver we could acquire, in trade abroad. We had a multitude of markets for our provi&s;ions, lum|ber and iron. The&s;e allowed liberties, with &s;ome others we a&s;&s;umed, enabled us to collect con&s;iderable &s;ums of money for the joint benefit of our&s;elves and our mother country.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009950_0007_0F7B3AC30ACEC8E0">
BUT the modern regulations are in every circum|&s;tance afflicting. The remittances we have been able to make to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with all the licence hi|therto granted or taken, and all the money brought among us in the cour&s;e of the late war, have not been &s;ufficient to pay her what we owe; but there &s;till remains due, according to a late calculation made by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> merchants, the &s;um of four millions &s;terling. Be&s;ides this, we are and have been for many years heavily taxed, for the payment of the debts contracted by our efforts again&s;t the common enemy.

The la&s;t<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">While the quantity of paper currency is proportioned to the u&s;es for it, it mu&s;t be beneficial; and therefore to &s;ink it below that quantity, mu&s;t be prejudicial.</NOTE> &s;inks our paper currency very fa&s;t. The former &s;weeps off our &s;ilver and gold in a torrent to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and leaves us continually toiling to &s;upply from a number of di&s;tant &s;prings the continually wa&s;ting &s;tream.</P>

<P>IN defence of the prohibition to in&s;titute <HI>bills of cre|dit,</HI> it may be said, "that &s;ome few colonies, by injudi|cious emi&s;&s;ions of paper currency, did great injury to indi|viduals."

<P>In the year 1723 the fir&s;t bills of credit were emitted in <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania,</HI> to the value of &pound; 45000. In 1728, part of the fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion be|ing then &s;unk, &pound; 30000 more were emitted. It appears from the account above, that in &s;even years from 1723 to 1730, the exports increa&s;ed &pound; 32 599 8 1 &s;terling.&mdash;In 1738, great part of the preceding emi&s;&s;i|ons being then &s;unk, there was an emi&s;&s;ion and re-emi&s;&s;ion amounting in the whole to &pound; 80000. In five years afterwards it appears by the ac|count above, the exports increa&s;ed near &pound; 20000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>In later times when larger emi&s;&s;ions have been made, the exports have proportionably increa&s;ed. In 1753 &pound; 55000 were emitted; and in 1756 &pound; 30000&mdash;In 1757, the exports amounted to &pound; 268 426 6 6&mdash;After|wards our emi&s;&s;ions were &s;till greater, and in one year of the war, the exports ro&s;e to more than &pound; 700,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>It is not pretended, that the increa&s;e of our importations is <HI>&s;olely</HI> ow|ing to the emi&s;&s;ions of paper money; but it is thought to be a very great cau&s;e of that increa&s;e. It is undoubtedly owing in part to the increa&s;e of people by propagation, and the influx of foreigners. But &s;uch <HI>great</HI> and <HI>&s;udden</HI> increa&s;es as have been mentioned in the &s;hort &s;pace of &s;even or five years, from 1723 to 1730, and from 1737 to 1742, could not in any great degree proceed from the increa&s;e by propagation; and at that time I think foreigners did not flow in up|on us in &s;uch numbers as they &s;ince have done. In the war large &s;ums were brought among us for the maintenance of the fleets and armies, it is true: but that our currency was then of great utility is evident, becau&s;e when the greate&s;t quantity of it was pa&s;&s;ing, bills of exchange were lower than they were for a long time before, or have been &s;ince.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that the complaint of the &s;carcity of money in <HI>America,</HI> particularly in this province, cannot be well founded, as we have lately had &s;uch large emi&s;&s;ions. I am very &s;en&s;ible how liable per|&s;ons are to errors in que&s;tions of this nature, and therefore I think my|&s;elf obliged to &s;peak with diffidence on the &s;ubject. Perhaps the follow|ing ob&s;ervations may in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wer the objection. 1&s;t. About one half of the emi&s;&s;ions is &s;unk 2dly A very great part of the bills now circulating, are pa&s;&s;ing in the neighbouring provinces. 3dly. Our gold and &s;ilver are &s;ent to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &s;o that but &s;mall quantities thereof are now current among us&mdash;and therefore we mu&s;t almo&s;t en|tirely rely on our paper for the medium of dome&s;tic commerce. La&s;tly, It does not &s;eem probable, that we &s;hould have heard &s;uch great com|plaints of the &s;carcity of money, if the extreme re&s;trictions of our com|merce, had not &s;o generally prevented our u&s;ual methods of acquiring it.</P></NOTE> increa&s;e of our importations &s;hewed how advantageous they were to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> If any
<PB N="10" REF="009950_0009_0F7B3AC41EC136F8">
inconveniences were feared from this kind of currency, means might have been found to prevent them, with|out utterly aboli&s;hing it: but now, the apprehen&s;ion of mi&s;chiefs that might have been more ea&s;ily obviated, has deprived us of real benefits.</P>
<P>PERHAPS no mode could be devis'd more advantage|ous to the public, or to individuals, than our method of emitting bills in this province for our own u&s;e. They are lent out upon good &s;ecurity, chiefly real, at the intere&s;t of <HI>five per cent.</HI> The borrowers are allowed a long term for payment, and the &s;ums borrowed being divided into equal portions, they are obliged to pay one of the&s;e with the intere&s;t of the whole, every year during the term. This renders the payments very ea&s;y; and as no per&s;on
<PB N="11" REF="009950_0010_0F7B3AC4C3A39078">
is permitted to borrow a large &s;um, a great number are accommodated. The con&s;equences of &s;uch regulations are obvious. The&s;e bills repre&s;ent money in the &s;ame manner that money repre&s;ents other things. As long therefore as the quantity is proportioned to the u&s;es, the&s;e emi&s;&s;ions have the &s;ame effects, that the gradual introduction of additional &s;ums of money would have. People of very &s;mall fortunes are enabled to purcha&s;e and cultivate land, which is of &s;o much con&s;equence in &s;ettling new countries, or to carry on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, that without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance they would be incapable of managing: For no private per&s;on would lend money on &s;uch favourable terms. From the borrowers the currency pa&s;&s;es into other hands, encrea&s;es con&s;ump|tion, rai&s;es the prices of commodities, quickens circu|lation, and after communicating a vigour to all kinds of indu&s;try, returns in its cour&s;e into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the borrowers, to repay them for that labour which it may properly be &s;aid to have produced. They deliver it, according to the original contracts, into the trea&s;ury, where the intere&s;t rai&s;es a fund without the impo&s;ition of taxes, for the public u&s;e.</P>
<P>WHILE emi&s;&s;ions are thus conducted with prudence, they may be compared to &s;prings, who&s;e water an indu&s;trious and knowing farmer &s;preads in many mean|dering rivulets through his gardens and meadows, and after it has refre&s;hed all the vegetable tribes it meets with, and has &s;et them a growing, leads it into a re|cevoir, where it an&s;wers &s;ome new purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IF it could be po&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h a currency through|out the colonies, on &s;ome foundation of this kind, per|haps greater benefits might be derived from it, than would be generally believed without the trial.</P>

<P>IF our importations from them &s;hould be re-exported to <HI>Europe,</HI> the profits would center in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> according to the u&s;ual cour&s;e of our trade.

Not to in&s;i&s;t on the merely po|litical advantage of having a commerce with that <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> kingdom, which by being beneficial to her, may more firmly attach her to our intere&s;t, it may be ob&s;erved, that the trade of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to <HI>Sweden,</HI> it is for iron in the gro&s;s, which is afterwards worked up, and large quantities of it re&punc;exported; &s;o that money may thereby be brought into the kingdom, and a great number of hands is em|ployed.

<P>BESIDES the circum&s;tances already mentioned to prove the injurious con&s;equences of the late re&s;trictions, there is another, which has great force in per&s;uading me that our trade ought by all means to be more encou|raged and extended at this time, than was formerly nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>NEITHER are the merchants here by any means able to bear taxes, as they do at home. A very great num|ber of them there put &s;uch &s;tocks into trade, as would be thought large fortunes among us; and our mer|chants would think them&s;elves very happy to leave off bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;uch e&s;tates as the others begin with. I &s;peak of the merchants in general; for we have on the continent individuals who are rich, but their number
<PB N="21" REF="009950_0020_0F7B3ACF4D844420">
is too incon&s;iderable to de&s;erve any notice or this oc|ca&s;ion. Be&s;ides, the intere&s;t of money being lower at home than it is here, tho&s;e who trade on borrowed &s;tocks, can do it to much greater advantage there than we can. Indeed, among us it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to get money to trade upon at any rate. How unequal, under the pre&s;ent di&s;advantages, a merchant's commerce will be to the payment of all the taxes impo&s;ed by the STAMP ACT on his policies, fees with clerks, charter parties, prote&s;ts, his other notarial acts his letters, and even his adverti&s;ements, experience, I am afraid will unhappily prove.</P>
<P>THUS, I apprehend, that this Act will be extremely heavy on tho&s;e who are lea&s;t able to bear it; and if our merchants and people of little &s;ub&s;tance langui&s;h under it, all others mu&s;t be affected. Our mode of taxation, hath always been by making as exact an e&s;timate as could be formed of each man's e&s;tate; by which means, our taxes have been proportioned to the abilities of tho&s;e who were to pay them. Few per&s;ons are employed in the col|lection of them; their allowance is very moderate; and therefore the expence is &s;mall. No exce&s;&s;ive penalties, no tribes of informers, no dreadful and dete&s;table courts are nece&s;&s;ary. This I imagine, is the mode of taxation, which in young colonies, will be found to be lea&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive and de&s;tructive, and certainly the mo&s;t equal: But by the Stamp Act, the<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">If a rich man buys land, it is generally from the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and therefore the &s;ellers &s;ituation will oblige him to pay for the deed, when the other in&s;i&s;ts on it; and when a man borrows money, every body knows who pays for the bonds and mortgages.</NOTE> wealthy who have money to let out at intere&s;t, or to make purcha&s;es, and undoubtedly ought to pay the mo&s;t towards the public charges, will e&s;cape the&s;e taxes, while the whole

weight of them will fall on the nece&s;&s;itous and indu&s;tri|ous, who mo&s;t of all require relief and encouragement.</P>
<P>BUT it may be &s;aid, "That the merchants will not be affected by the&s;e taxes, becau&s;e they will rai&s;e the prices of their goods in proportion, and that at length <HI>all taxes mu&s;t ari&s;e from lands.</HI>"</P>
<P>THIS rule &s;eems more applicable to very populous and rich countries, where the manufacturers and land|holders through nece&s;&s;ity or the force of fa&s;hions, have pre&s;&s;ing demands upon the merchants, than to &s;uch a country as this, where a great majority of the people live on their lands in a very plain way. For by practi&s;ing a &s;trict frugality and indu&s;try, <HI>we</HI> may render our&s;elves more independent of the merchants, than the circum&s;tances of more populous and wealthy &s;tates will permit the other cla&s;&s;es of their people to be. The high prices therefore which our merchants impo&s;e upon their goods, will di&s;courage the &s;ale of them, and con&s;e|quently they mu&s;t "be affected by the taxes," which oblige them to rai&s;e the prices in this manner.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, granting that all taxes mu&s;t ari&s;e from lands; it follows, that where the profits of the lands are &s;mall, they can bear but &s;mall taxes. The more labour is be&s;towed on them, the greater the profits <HI>will</HI> be, and the <HI>taxes may</HI> be. In old populous countries there is an opportunity of be&s;towing this labour, and the manner of doing it is well under&s;tood. Thus in <HI>England,</HI> the profits of land are &s;o great, as to &s;upport a very large number of nobility and gentry in &s;plendor, and to afford means of rai&s;ing taxes to an amazing amount. Nor are the workers of the land unrewarded; for the farmers have &s;uch long lea&s;es, and other encouragements, that they thrive and live com|fortably, and many of them are very wealthy.</P>

<P>In pur&s;uance of this de&s;ign to bring down the pride of the&s;e PRINCELY PLANTERS, &s;uch heavy impo&s;itions were laid in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> on to|bacco, that the inhabitants of <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> were di&s;couraged from rai&s;ing it. Then the mother country FELT her error, and the&s;e PRINCES were found to be very poor people. The &s;ame <HI>unhappy &s;pirit</HI> is now producing the &s;ame mi&s;take.

under an enormous load of debt. Never was there a greater mi&s;take. This opinion has ari&s;en from &s;light ob&s;ervations made in our cities during the late war, when large &s;ums of money were &s;pent here in &s;upport of fleets and armies. Our productions were then in great demand, and trade flouri&s;hed. Having a number of &s;trangers among us, the people na|turally not ungenerous or inho&s;pitable, indulged them&s;elves in many uncommon expences. But the cau&s;e of this gaiety has cea&s;ed, and all the effect re|maining, is, that we are to be treated as a rich people, when we are really poor. <HI>Tully</HI> mentions a man who lo&s;t an honourable office, by the homely entertainment he gave the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> when he could have af|forded a better; but we have lo&s;t va&s;tly more by the imprudent exce&s;s of kindne&s;s, with which we have
<PB N="25" REF="009950_0024_0F7B3AD5344871F8">
treated the people of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> who have come among us, at an expence that did not &s;uit our fortunes.</P>
<P>To all the di&s;advantages that have been mentioned, it mu&s;t be added, that our markets are much more precarious than tho&s;e at home. It is computed, that one half of the people there live in cities, and con&s;e|quently there mu&s;t be a perpetual dome&s;tic demand for the productions of the earth; and foreign markets are not far di&s;tant for the overplus. Here the quantity &s;old for con&s;umption among us is &s;mall, and mo&s;t of the foreign markets are very remote.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons induce me to think, that the colonies, unle&s;s &s;ome fortunate events, not to be expected, &s;hould happen, cannot bear the re&s;trictions and taxations laid upon them by their mother country, without &s;uffering very &s;everely. What then can we do? Which way &s;hall we turn our&s;elves? How may we mitigate the mi&s;eries of our country? <HI>Great-Britain</HI> gives us an example to guide us. SHE TEACHES US TO MAKE A DI|STINCTION BETWEEN HER INTERESTS AND OUR OWN. Teaches! She requires&mdash;commands&mdash;in&s;i&s;ts upon it&mdash;threatens&mdash;compels&mdash;and even di&s;tre&s;&s;es us into it.</P>
<P>WE have our choice of the&s;e two things&mdash;to continue our pre&s;ent limited and di&s;advantageous commerce&mdash;or to promote manufactuers among our|&s;elves, with a habit of oeconomy, and thereby remove the nece&s;&s;ity we are now under of being &s;upplied by <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not difficult to determine which of the&s;e things is mo&s;t eligible. Could the la&s;t of them be only &s;o far

executed, as to bring our demand for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manu|factures below the profits of our foreign trade, and the amount of our commodities immediately remitted home, the&s;e colonies might revive and flouri&s;h. States and families are enriched by the &s;ame means; that is, by being &s;o indu&s;trious an I frugal, as to &s;pend le&s;s than what they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> can pay for.</P>
<P>WE have examples in this province, which if imi|tated by others, mu&s;t unavoidably produce the mo&s;t happy effects for us: I mean the examples of the in|du&s;trious, frugal, hone&s;t <HI>Germans.</HI> Their lands are as well cultivated as they can be in this new country, and they have the good &s;en&s;e to require very little provi&s;i|ons and cloaths more than they can get from their own farms, and make with their own hands. If we only con&s;ider for a moment the con&s;equences of &s;uch a con|duct, &s;hould it be general, we mu&s;t be convinced it mu&s;t produce commerce, &s;ince all &s;uperfluities would be exported; and the Owners having few demands in return, <HI>that commerce</HI> would of cour&s;e produce wealth.</P>
<P>INDEED we &s;hall be compelled, I apprehend, generally to imitate the&s;e examples. The late regulations, and our con|&s;tant remittances to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> have extremely le&s;|&s;ened the quantity of money among us, and yet the&s;e remittances are not &s;ufficient to pay for tho&s;e things we want from home. Nece&s;&s;ity will teach us two ways to relieve our&s;elves. The one is, to keep the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> ma|nufactures we purcha&s;e longer in u&s;e or wear than we have been accu&s;tomed to do. The other is, to &s;upply their place by manufactures of our own. I dont &s;up|po&s;e our difficulties will <HI>immediately</HI> produce expert ar|ti&s;ts among us; but as the inhabitants here generally
<PB N="27" REF="009950_0026_0F7B3AD6C5DCBF68">
re&s;ide on their lands, and live in a plain ru&s;tic way, they will be able to &s;upply them&s;elves with many arti|cles. Some author, and I think <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> &s;ays, that in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> every family has all the trades in it that are nece&s;&s;ary for its u&s;e. Their work is not, it may be pre&s;umed, at all in the ta&s;te of <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Paris,</HI> but it &s;erves their purpo&s;e; and their coar&s;e cloaths and &s;imple furniture enable them to live in plenty, and to defend their liberty. Something of this kind will be, nay, already is, practi&s;ed by us. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee the linen and cloth that have been lately made among us. Many gentlemen in this city dre&s;s now in &s;uits produced, manufactured, and made up in this province. The cloth is not equal in finene&s;s to the be&s;t broad-cloth, but it is warm, &s;trong, and not very homely; and when the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> workmen under&s;tand that they may meer with better encouragement here than they do at home, I believe in a few years we &s;hall have very different kinds of cloth among us from the&s;e we now make. In&s;tances are not wanting to ju&s;tify the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations on this head. <HI>Spain</HI> u&s;ed formerly to be entirely &s;upplied with cloths from <HI>England;</HI> but in the reigns only of their two la&s;t kings, <HI>Philip</HI> the Vth, and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the VIth, their manufactures have been improved to &s;uch a degree, even by that proud and indolent people, that this commerce has entirely cea&s;ed in mo&s;t parts of that kingdom. The &s;ame thing has happened in <HI>France,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the de&s;tructive wars in which &s;he has been continually involved. <HI>Switzerland</HI> &s;ome time ago &s;pent large &s;ums of money in foreign commodities, but now they make excellent cloths, and good &s;ink, though the &s;cheme at fir&s;t laboured under very great difficulties.

efforts are already made among us, that it cannot be doubted, that before the end of this century, the modern regulations will teach <HI>America,</HI> that &s;he has re&s;ources within her&s;elf, of which &s;he never otherwi&s;e would have thought.

<P>IT has hitherto been thought, by the people of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and I hope it will &s;till be thought, that &s;ufficient advantages are derived by her from the colonies, without laying taxes upon them.

Every advantage accruing to the colonies by their connection with the mother country, is <HI>amply</HI>&mdash;<HI>dearly</HI>&mdash;paid for, by the be|nefits derived to her from them, and by the re&s;trictions of their commerce.

<P>IF any man who does not chu&s;e to &s;pend much time in con&s;idering this &s;ubject, would only read the &s;peeches from the throne during that period, with the addre&s;&s;es in an&s;wer to them, he will &s;oon be convinced <HI>for who&s;e benefit Great-Britain</HI> thought &s;he was exerting her&s;elf. For my part, I &s;hould not now be &s;urprized, if tho&s;e who maintain the abovementioned a&s;&s;ertions, &s;hould contend, that <HI>Great Britain</HI> ought to tax <HI>Protugal.</HI> For was not that kingdom "defended by the troops and trea&s;ure of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI>" And how can &s;he be "otherwi&s;e re|compen&s;ed for this expence and lo&s;s?" If the protection of <HI>Portugal,</HI> though no taxes are received from thence, was beneficial to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> infinitely more &s;o was the protection of the colonies.</P>
<P>SO far I mu&s;t beg leave to di&s;&s;ent from the&s;e gentle|men, that if the colonies, by an increa&s;e of indu&s;try
<PB N="32" REF="009950_0031_0F7BD0149C0779E0">
and frugality, &s;hould become able to bear this taxation, it will, in my apprehen&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding be in|jurious to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> If the &s;um be trifling, it cannot be worth the di&s;content and unhappine&s;s the taking it will produce among &s;o many faithful &s;ubjects of his Maje&s;ty. If it be con&s;iderable, it mu&s;t al&s;o be hurtful in another re&s;pect.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be granted, that it is not merely the bringing money into a nation that makes it wealthy, but the bringing money into it by the general indu&s;try of its inhabitants. A country may perpetually receive va&s;t &s;ums, and yet be perpetually poor. It mu&s;t al&s;o be granted, that almo&s;t all the money acquired by the co|lonies in their other branches of trade, is &s;pent by them in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and finds employment for her people. Whatever then le&s;&s;ens the &s;um &s;o &s;pent, mu&s;t le&s;&s;en that employment. This I think will be one con&s;e|quence of the STAMP ACT: For our demand will be as much le&s;s for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufactures, as the amount of the &s;ums rai&s;ed by the taxes. So much the fewer <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> merchants, arti&s;ts, &s;eamen and &s;hips will be em|ployed by us, and &s;o much the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at fir&s;t, and afterwards &s;o much the more frugal,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Great-Britain</HI> will not only lo&s;e in &s;uch ca&s;e, the annual amount of the taxes, but the people of <HI>America</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hing manufactures through di&s;content, will in time entirely withdraw their intercour&s;e with her&mdash;And therefore her lo&s;s of the whole <HI>American</HI> trade, may be ju&s;tly at|tributed to this inau&s;picious beginning.</NOTE> ingenious, laborious and independent will the coloni&s;ts become.</P>
<P>It is evident from the concurrent te&s;timony of her own mo&s;t noted authors on this &s;ubject, that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is &s;ure of having our money at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See notes to page 4.</NOTE> la&s;t; and it appears no difficult matter to determine, whether it is better to take it in taxes or trade.&mdash;Suppo&s;e the

STAMP ACT, enforced by uncommon penalties and unheard of jurisdictions, &s;hould pick up every piece of gold and &s;ilver that &s;hall wander into the plantations, what would <HI>Great-Britain</HI> gain by this mea&s;ure? Or rather what would &s;he not lo&s;e, by attempting to advance her revenue by means &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to commerce?</P>
<P>BUT if the late re&s;trictions &s;hall not prove <HI>profitable,</HI> perhaps they may by &s;ome be called <HI>prudent</HI> for another rea&s;on. We are informed that many per&s;ons at home affect to &s;peak of the <HI>coloni&s;ts,</HI> as of a people de&s;igning and endeavouring to render them&s;elves independent, and therefore it may be &s;aid to be proper as much as po&s;&s;ible to depre&s;s them. This method for &s;ecuring obedience, has been tried by many powerful nations, and &s;eems to be the con&s;tant policy of commonwealths: But the attempt in almo&s;t every in&s;tance from <HI>Athens</HI> down to <HI>Genoa,</HI> has been un&s;ucce&s;sful. Many &s;tates and kingdoms have lo&s;t their dominions by &s;everity and an unju&s;t jealou&s;y. I remember none that have been lo&s;t by kindne&s;s and a generous confidence. Evils are frequently precipitated, by imprudent attempts to pre|vent them. In &s;hort, we never can be made an inde|pendent people, except it be by<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>"If we are afraid that one day or other the colonies will revolt, and &s;et up for them&s;elves, as &s;ome &s;eem to apprehend, let us not <HI>drive</HI> them to a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to <HI>feel</HI> them&s;elves independent of us; as they <HI>will</HI> do, the moment they perceive that <HI>they can be &s;upplied with all things from within them&s;elves,</HI> and do not need our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>"All wi&s;e &s;tates will well con&s;ider how to pre&s;erve the advantages ari&s;ing from colonies, and avoid the evils. And I conceive that there can be but TWO ways in nature to hinder them from throwing off their dependence; <HI>one,</HI> to keep it out of their <HI>power,</HI> and the <HI>other,</HI> out of their <HI>will.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> mu&s;t be by <HI>force;</HI> and the <HI>latter,</HI> by <HI>u&s;ing them well,</HI> and keeping them employed in &s;uch productions, and making &s;uch manufactures, as will &s;upport them&s;elves and families comfortably, <HI>and procure them wealth too,</HI> and at lea&s;t not prejudice their mother country.</P>
<P><HI>Force</HI> can never be u&s;ed effectually to an&s;wer the end, <HI>without de&s;troy|ing the colonies them&s;elves.</HI> Liberty and encouragement are nece&s;&s;ary to carry people thither, and to keep them together when they are there; and violence will hinder both. Any body of troops con&s;iderable enough to awe them, and keep them in &s;ubjection under the direction too of a needy governor, often &s;ent thither to make his fortune, and at &s;uch a di&s;tance from any application for redre&s;s, will &s;oon put an end to all planting, and leave the country to the &s;oldiers alone, and if it did not, <HI>would eat up all the profit of the colony.</HI> For this rea&s;on, arbitrary coun|tries have not been equally &s;ucce&s;sful in planting colonies with free ones, and what they have done in that kind, has either been by force at a va&s;t expence, or <HI>by departing from the nature of their government,</HI> and <HI>giving &s;uch privileges to planters</HI> as were <HI>denied to their other &s;ubjects.</HI> And I dare &s;ay, that a few prudent laws, and a little prudent conduct, would &s;oon give us far the greate&s;t &s;hare of the riches of all <HI>America,</HI> perhaps drive many of other nations out of it, or into our colonies for &s;helter.</P>
<P>There are <HI>&s;o many exigencies</HI> in all &s;tates, <HI>&s;o many foreign wars,</HI> and <HI>dome&s;tic di&s;turbances,</HI> that the&s;e colonies CAN NEVER WANT OPPORTU|NITIES, if they watch for them, <HI>to do what they &s;hall find their intere&s;t to do;</HI> and therefore we ought to take all the precautions in our power, that it &s;hall never be <HI>their intere&s;t</HI> to act again&s;t that of their native country; an evil which can no otherwi&s;e be averted, than by keeping them <HI>fully employed</HI> in &s;uch trades <HI>as will increa&s;e their own,</HI> as well as our wealth; for it is much to be feared, if we do not find employment for <HI>them,</HI> they may find it for <HI>us.</HI> The intere&s;t of the mother country, is always to keep them dependent, and &s;o employed; and it requires, all her addre&s;s to do it; and it is certainly more <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> and <HI>effectually</HI> done by <HI>gentle</HI> and <HI>in&s;en&s;ible</HI> methods, than by <HI>power</HI> alone."</P>

<P>BUT if this event &s;hall ever happen, which Providence I hope will never permit, it mu&s;t be when the pre&s;ent generation and the pre&s;ent &s;et of &s;entiments are extinct. Late mea&s;ures have indeed excited an univer&s;al and un|exampled grief and indignation throughout the colonies.

<P>THE reflections of the coloni&s;ts on the&s;e melancholy &s;ubjects, are not a little embittered by a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that they never would have been treated as they are, if <HI>Canada</HI> &s;till continued in the hands of the <HI>French.</HI> Thus, their hearts glowing with every &s;entiment of duty and affection towards their mother country, and expecting, not unrea&s;onably perhaps, &s;ome marks of tenderne&s;s in return, are pierced by a fatal di&s;covery, that the vigo|rous

<P>I Have omitted mentioning one thing that &s;eems to be connected with the foregoing &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WITH a va&s;t expence of blood and wealth, we fought our way in the late war up to the doors of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> trea&s;uries, and by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Florida,</HI> might obtain &s;ome recompence for that expence. <HI>Pen&s;acola</HI> and the other ports in that country, are convenient places, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> might meet us, and exchange their &s;ilver for the manufactures of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the provi&s;ions of the&s;e colonies. By this means, a commerce inconceivably beneficial to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects, might be carried on. This commerce the <HI>Spaniards</HI> wi&s;h and have endeavoured to carry on. Many hundred thou|&s;and dollars have been brought by them to <HI>Pen&s;acola</HI> to lay out there; but the men of war on that &s;tation have compelled them to take back their cargoes, <HI>the receipt of which,</HI> it may from thence be pre&s;umed, <HI>would be de|&s;tructive to the intere&s;ts of Great Britain.</HI>&mdash;Thus we re|ceive le&s;s advantage from <HI>Florida,</HI> now it belongs to us, than we did when it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by our enemies; for then by permi&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> governors, to trade there, we derived con&s;iderable emoluments from our intercour&s;e with them.</P>
<P>UPON what rea&s;ons this conduct is founded, is not ea&s;y to determine. Sure no one con&s;iders <HI>Florida</HI> in the &s;ame light with <HI>the&s;e colonies,</HI> and thinks that no ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be permitted to trade there, but <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;hipping. This would be to apply the acts of navi|gation
<PB N="38" REF="009950_0037_0F7B3ADFCE8387C8">
to purpo&s;es directly oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of them. They were intended to pre&s;erve an intercour&s;e between the <HI>mother country</HI> and her <HI>colonies,</HI> and thus to cultivate a <HI>mutual affection;</HI> to promote the intere&s;ts of <HI>both,</HI> by an exchange of <HI>their</HI> mo&s;t valuable productions for <HI>her</HI> manufacutures; thereby to increa&s;e the &s;hipping of both; and thus render them capable of affording aid to each other. Which of the&s;e purpo&s;es is an&s;wered by pro|hibiting a commerce, that can be no other way carried on? That is, by forbidding the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to bring their wealth <HI>for us</HI> to <HI>Florida,</HI> which is an unhealthy &s;and-bank, held by a garri&s;on, at a great expence of money, and a greater of lives, that cannot for ages, if ever it will, yield a &s;ingle advantage to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but <HI>that</HI> &s;he refu&s;es to enjoy.</P>
