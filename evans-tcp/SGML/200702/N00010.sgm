<HEAD>TO OUR BELOVED BRETHREN AND NEIGHBOURS the Inhabitants of the Massachusets, the Governour, Assista<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s and Deputies assembled in the Generall Court of that Jurisdiction wish grace and peace in our Lord Jesus Christ.</HEAD>
<P>S<HI>O soon as God had set up Politicall Government among his people Israel hee gave them a body of lawes fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> judgement both in civil and criminal causes. These were breif and fundamental principles, yet withall so full and comprehensive as out of them clear deductions were to be drawne to all particular cases in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> times. For a Common-wealth without lawes is like a Ship without rigging and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eeradge. Nor is it suffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t to have principles or fundamentals, but these are to be drawn out into so many of their deductions as the time and condition of that people may have use of.  And it is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; injurious to the body of the people to put them to learn their duty and libertie from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, nor is it enough to have lawes except they be also just.  Therefore among other priviledges which the Lord bestowed upon his peculiar people, these he call them specially to consider of, that God was ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rer to them and their lawes were more righteous then other nations. God was sayd to be amongst them or neer to them because of his Ordinances established by himselfe and their lawes righteous because himselfe was their Law-giver: yet in the comparison are implyed two things, first that other nations had somthing of Gods presence amongst them. Secondly that there was also somwhat of equitie in their lawes, for it pleased the Father (upon the Covenant of Redemption with his Son) to restore so much of his Image to lost man as whereby all nations are disposed to worship God, and to advance righteousnes: which appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that of the Apostle</HI> Rom. 1. 21. They knew God &amp;c: <HI>and in the</HI> 2. 14. They did by nature the things con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eined in the law of God. <HI>But the nations corrupting his Ordinances (both of Religion, and Justice) God withdrew his presence from them proportionably whereby they were given up to abominable lusts</HI> Rom. 2. 21. <HI>Wheras if they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">alked according to that light &amp; law of nature they might have been preserved from such moral evils and might have injoyed a com|mon blessing in all their natural and civil Ordinances: now, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t might have been so with the nation who were so much strangers to the Covenant of Grace, what advantage have they who have interest in this Covenant, and may injoye the special presence of God in the puritie and na|tive simplicitie of all his Ordinances by which he is so neer to his owne people.  This hath been no small priviledge, and advantage to us in New-England that our Churches, and civil State have been planted, and growne up (like two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">) together like that of Israel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the wilder|nes by which wee were put in minde (and had opportunitie put into our hands) not only to gather our Churches, and set up the Ordinances of Christ Jesus in them according to the Apostolick patterne by such light as the Lord graciously afforded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but also withall to frame our civil Po|litie, and lawes according to the rules of his most holy word whereby each do help and strengthen other (the Churches the civil Authoritie, and the civil Authoritie the Churches) and so hath prosper the better without such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">emulation, and contention for priviledges or priority as have proved the misery (if not ruine) of both in some other places.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For this end about nine years since wee used the help of some of the Elders of our Churches to compose a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dell of the Iudiciall lawes of Moses with such other cases as might be referred to them, with intent to make use of them in composing our lawes, but not to have them published as the lawes of this Jurisdiction: nor were they voted in Court.  For that book intitled</HI> The Liberties &amp;c: <HI>published about seven years since (which conteines also many lawes and orders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for civil &amp; criminal causes, and is commonly (though without ground) reported to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our Fundamentalls that wee owne as established by Authoritie of this Court, and that after three years experience &amp; generall probation: and accordingly we have inserted them into this vo|lume under the severall heads to which they belong yet not as fundamentalls, for divers of him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> been repealed, or altered, and more may justly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> shall discover defects or inconveniences for</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l simul natum et perfectum.

<HI>The same must we say of this present Volume, we have not published it as a perfect body of laws sufficient to carry on the Government established for future time nor could it be expected that we should promise such a thing.  For if it be no disparagement to the wisedome of that High Court of Parliament in England that in four hundred years they could not so compile their lawes, and regulate proceedings in Courts of justice &amp;c: but that they had still new work to do of the same kinde almost every Parliament: there can be no just cause to blame a poor Colonie (being in furnished of Lawyers and Statesmen) that in eighteen years hath produced no more, nor letter rules for a good, and setled Government then this Book holds forth. nor have you (our Bretheren and Neighbours) any cause, whether you look back upon our Native Country, or take your observation by other States, &amp; Common wealths its Europe) to complaine of such as you have imployed in this service; for the time which hath been spent in making lawes, and repealing and altering them so often, nor of the charge which the Country hath been put to for those occasions, the Civilian gives you a satisf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ctorie reason of such continuall alterations additions &amp;c:</HI> Crescit in Orbe dolus.</P>
<P><HI>These Lawes which were made successively in divers former years, we have reduced un|der severall heads in an alphabeticall method, that so they might the more readilye be found, &amp; that the divers lawes concerning one matter being placed together the scope and intent of the whole and of every of them might the more easily be apprehended: we must confesse we have not been so exact in placing every law under its most proper title as we might, and would have been: the reason was our hasty indeavour to satisfie your longing expectation, and frequent complaints for want of such a volume to be published in print: wherin (upon every occasion) you might readily see the rule which you ought to walke by.  And in this (we hope) you will finde satisfaction, by the help of the references under the severall heads, and the Table which we have added in the end. For such lawes and orders as are not of generall concernment we have not put them into this booke, but they remain still in force, and are to be seen in the booke of the Records of the Court, but all generall laws not heer inserted nor mentioned to be still of force are to be accounted repealed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You have called us from amongst the rest of our Bretheren and given us power to make these lawes: we must now call upon you to see them executed: remembring that old &amp; true pro|verb,</HI> The execution of the law is the life of the law. <HI>If one sort of you</HI> <ABBR>viz:</ABBR> <HI>non-Freemen should object that you had no hand in calling us to this worke, and therfore think your selvs not bound to obedience &amp;c. Wee answer that a subsequent, or implicit consent is of like force in this case, as an expresse precedent power: for in putting your persons and estates into the pro|tection and way of subsistance held forth and exercised within this Jurisdiction, you do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">citly submit to this Government and to all the wholesome lawes therof, and so is the common repute in all nations and that upon this</HI> Maxim. Qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus.</P>
<P><HI>If any of you meet with some law that seemes not to tend to your particular benefit, you must consider that lawes are made with respect to the whole people, and not to each particular person: and obedience to them must be yeilded with respect to the common welfare, not to thy private advantage, and as thou yeil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">est obedience to the law for common good, but to thy dis|advantage: so another must observe some other law for thy good, though to his own<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> damage; thus must we be content to bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anothers burden and so fullfill the Law of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That distinction which is put between the Lawes of God and the lawes of men, becomes a share to many as it is mis-applyed in the ordering of their obedience to civil Authoritie; for when the Authoritie is of God and that in way of an Ordinance</HI> Rom. 13. 1. <HI>and when the administration of it is according to deductions, and rules gathered from the word of God, and the clear light of nature in civil nations, surely there is no humane law that tendeth to commo~ good (according to those principles) but the same is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ediately a law of God, and that in way of an Ordinance which all are to submit unto and that for conscience sake.</HI> Rom. 13. 5.</P>
