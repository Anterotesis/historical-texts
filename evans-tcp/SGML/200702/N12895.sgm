<P>LETTERS OF PAPINIAN: IN WHICH The Conduct, pre&s;ent State and Pro&s;pects, OF THE AMERICAN CONGRESS, ARE EXAMINED.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader &s;hould be reminded that the ground of the unhappy conte&s;t between Great-Britain and her Colonies, is wholly changed. A redre&s;s of grievances was all that the American Congre&s;s claimed at fir&s;t. This redre&s;s has been repeatedly and amply offered by Government: Government is therefore guiltle&s;s of whatever con|&s;equences may attend the war.</P>
<P>But matters of this &s;ort are now entirely forgotten, and out of the que&s;tion. Empire, foreign alliances, and the ruin of the Parent State, are the <HI>&s;ublime</HI> objects which the Congre&s;s are now <HI>piou&s;ly</HI> labouring to accompli&s;h. The Congre&s;s, as a body, are the authors of all the calamities which overwhelm America. Their conduct, as a body, which is cri|minal in the extreme, is therefore the &s;ubject of the following animadver&s;ions. The writer of the&s;e Letters hath no per&s;onal enmity again&s;t any mem|ber of Congre&s;s. He was, for this rea&s;on, under no bia&s;s, and had no inclination to run into per&s;onal invectives; he moreover di&s;dained the employment, and could not de&s;cend to &s;uch trifles, when matters of &s;o much greater moment demanded his attention. His heart bleeds for the calamities of his country: He tenderly &s;ympathizes in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his bre|thren; and feels a glow of indignation at the in|&s;ults which are daily offered to his amiable Sove|reign &mdash;at the injuries intended again&s;t the Parent State. Whoever hath &s;en&s;ations &s;imilar to the&s;e,
<PB N="iv" REF="016311_0003_0F9C2B01B53798A0">
will readily excu&s;e any a&s;perity that may be met with here, while the public conduct of tho&s;e who are the authors of the&s;e calamities, di&s;tre&s;&s;es, in&s;ults and injuries, is examined; e&s;pecially when that a&s;pe|rity is confined within the limits of truth and de|cency.</P>
<P>The American Congre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of more than <HI>&s;eventy</HI> members. Of the&s;e, <HI>eight</HI> or <HI>nine</HI> may be men of affluent fortunes&mdash;at lea&s;t, what are deemed &s;uch in America&mdash;worth perhaps from 10,000l. to 30,000l. &s;terl. All the re&s;t are either men of de&s;perate fortunes, plunged deep in debt; or in &s;uch circum&s;tances, that, &s;eparate from the emolu|ments of office, and the e&s;tates ama&s;&s;ed by the re|bellion, none of them could have credit for 5000l. in the ordinary cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s. Whether &s;uch men are fit to be tru&s;ted with ab&s;olute, uncontrolled power; or with the management of millions of mo|ney &mdash;a management wholly &s;ecret&mdash;a management which is &s;ubject to no public in&s;pection, nor account|able to any, let rea&s;on decide. What a temptation to corruption and tyranny! Willing however to do all the ju&s;tice to Congre&s;s that truth will per|mit, I may aver, that however prompted by ambi|tion, republican principles, or &s;elf-intere&s;t, they would not have had the audacity or pre&s;umption to pu&s;h matter, to &s;uch extremities, at <HI>this time,</HI> had they not been countenanced, abetted and &s;upported by a faction in England.</P>
<P>Ambition, avarice, and local pride are di&s;ea&s;es of the human mind, and perhaps the mo&s;t incurable. Truth and rea&s;on &s;eldom have &s;ufficient efficacy to remove them. When SOLON warned the Athenians to beware of the popular arts of <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> who was his kin&s;man, and that his de&s;ign was to en&s;lave them in
<PB N="v" REF="016311_0004_0F9C2B03142ED308">
the end, which actually happened; the Athenians pronounced SOLON to be <HI>maa</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See SOLON's Letter to EPIMENIDES, pre&s;erved by DIOG. LAERT. in vita Solon.</NOTE>. Should the author be con&s;idered in the &s;ame light by any per&s;ons, or be reviled, it would be &s;ome con&s;olation to him that one of the mo&s;t celebrated Legi&s;lators, and mo&s;t revered characters of antiquity, met with &s;imilar treatment, in a &s;imilar ca&s;e. Whether this may he his fate; or whether his countrymen may profit by the warnings here faithfully and &s;incerely given to them, he knows not: He has the &s;atisfaction however of an approving con&s;cience; and can reflect with plea&s;ure that he hath di&s;charged the duty of a good citizen and loyal &s;ubject, and hath done all in his power to avert the utter ruin of his country.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. To <HI>HENRY LAURENS,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE late procedure of the Congre&s;s in de|taining and impri&s;oning Lieut. HELE, of the Hotham &s;loop, bearing a flag of truce, being a flagrant violation of the law of nations, &s;hould not pa&s;s without reprehen&s;ion; nor the &s;ophi&s;try which would attempt to ju&s;tify it, without being detected and expo&s;ed. The &s;pirit which dictated this extraordinary mea&s;ure, is perfectly &s;imilar to that which actuates the Congre&s;s in all their other proceedings; this is an additional rea|&s;on why it &s;hould be held up to public view, that the men and their mea&s;ures may be the better known. The <HI>an&s;wer</HI> of Congre&s;s to Admiral GAMBIER's letter, requiring the relea&s;e of Lieut. HELE and his a&s;&s;ociates, having been authenticated by the &s;ignature of your name, I &s;hall addre&s;s to you the followihg <HI>&s;tric|tures</HI> on that an&s;wer, which, I pre&s;ume, you and they deem a full vindication of your conduct.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which gave ri&s;e to the above an&s;wer, are &s;o recent and well known, that it is need|le&s;s to recapitulate them minutely. It will be &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="4" REF="016311_0007_0F9C2B0577977200">
to ob&s;erve&mdash;that the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners, af|ter making the mo&s;t generous offers to the Congre&s;s, (&s;uch as no American in the hour of &s;ober rea&s;on and reflection had a right to expect, or would have refu|&s;ed) and attempting to bring about a reconciliation with the revolted colonies, in vain, thought proper, on the 3d of Oct. 1778, to i&s;&s;ue their final <HI>manife&s;to and proclamation,</HI> renewing their former offers, and in|timating their intention of returning to England &s;pee|dily, in ca&s;e they were rejected&mdash;that this <HI>proclamation</HI> was addre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the Congre&s;s&mdash; that Lieut. HELE, in the Hotham &s;loop, bearing a flag of truce, was charged with the delivery of the <HI>proclamation</HI> to the Congre&s;s&mdash;that his &s;loop was wreck|ed in the Bay of Delaware, while proceeding on this bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;that two of his people peri&s;hed on the wreck &mdash;and that him&s;elf and the remainder, who with diffi|culty reached the &s;hore, were &s;eized and flung into pri&s;on, by order of the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>On receiving the fir&s;t intelligence of this inhuman act, &s;o repugnant to the practice of all nations, civil|ized or &s;avage, Admiral GAMBIER ordered an appli|cation to be made to Mr. Beatty, the rebel Commi&s;|&s;ary of Pri&s;oners, demanding the immediate relea&s;e of Lieut. HELE and his companions. Two re&s;olves of the Congre&s;s, authori&s;ing this nefarious deed, were tran&s;mitted by Mr. Beatty; and no other &s;atisfaction was obtained: Lieut. HELE and his men were &s;till detained in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>A gallant officer will poignantly feel any in&s;ult offered to his Sovereign&mdash;any injury done to tho&s;e who &s;erve under him. The Admiral wrote a very &s;en&s;ible, &s;pirited letter to the Congre&s;s, repeating the former demand, and expo&s;tulating with them on the in|ju&s;tice of their procedure. Among other things he urged,</P>
<Q><P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="016311_0008_0F9C2B05C0D91A20">
1&s;t. That it was an undue advantage taken of the calamity of a wreck, and that wreck a flag of truce.</P>
<P N="2">2d.
The re&s;olution on which the Congre&s;s now wi&s;h to ju&s;tify them&s;elves, is &s;ub&s;equent in date to the fact of which they complain.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The manife&s;to in que&s;tion was addre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the Congre&s;s them&s;elves, and could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;editious.</P></Q>
<P>To the&s;e arguments, equally true, ju&s;t and forcible, the Congre&s;s returned an <HI>oracular re&s;pon&s;e</HI>; &s;etting forth&mdash;
<Q>That as the manife&s;tos on board that ve&s;&s;el (the Hotham) were of a &s;editious nature, and in|tended to open an unwarrantable corre&s;pondence; their being covered with a flag of truce is by no means an extenuation of the offence.&mdash;That as no re&s;pect is due by the law of nations to a flag of truce when employed in illicit practices, &s;o when detect|ed, all the rights of a flag are forfeited; nor does the accidental wreck of the ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion make any di&s;tinction in favour of tho&s;e who navigated her.</Q></P>
<P>The di&s;ingenuous &s;ophi&s;try of this part of your an|&s;wer (and it is of a piece with the re&s;t) is as contemp|tible, as the mea&s;ure it would ju&s;tify, is ba&s;e and abominable. Every circum&s;tance relative to the flag of truce is mi&s;repre&s;ented; every thing is called by an appellation which implies guilt, and an air of criminality is thereby thrown upon the whole, in or|der to make out the appearance of an argument for your vindication. A manife&s;to containing the mo&s;t liberal overtures of accommodation, and addre&s;&s;ed to the Congre&s;s, is pronounced <HI>&s;editious,</HI> and tending <HI>to open an unwarrantable corre&s;pondence</HI>; a flag of truce engaged openly to convey tho&s;e manife&s;tos to the Congre&s;s, is &s;aid to be <HI>employed in illicit practices</HI>; and
<PB N="6" REF="016311_0009_0F9C2B06D63FBD60">
to be <HI>detected</HI> in tho&s;e practices, when wrecked on her pa&s;&s;age! Can any thing be more di&s;ingenuous, or a gro&s;&s;er violation of truth?</P>
<P>Yet were every tittle of this true, it would by no means ju&s;tify your conduct. The law of nations would not authori&s;e you to detain Lieut. HELE and his crew, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be even employed on the de&s;ign you alledge, and to have arrived at Philadel|phia: That law would ju&s;tify no more on your part than a refu&s;al of the manife&s;tos, the preventing their circulation, and a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the flag of truce, to return from whence &s;he came; but utterly forbids your barbarity to him when wrecked on his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The law of nations is no other than the law of rea&s;on applied to communities, in their intercour&s;e with each other, whether in peace or war; and their &s;en&s;e of it we mu&s;t learn from their practices in par|ticular ca&s;es. As peace is the legitimate object of war&mdash;as this object cannot be obtained, nor the horrors of war &s;oftened otherwi&s;e than by the in|tervention of per&s;ons who &s;hall tran&s;act between the belligerent powers: Mankind have always agreed in paying a reverential regard to tho&s;e who were employed for tho&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es, whether cal|led amba&s;&s;adors, envoys, plenipotentiaries, depu|ties, heralds, officers with a white flag, a drum, trumpet, or any thing el&s;e that was expre&s;&s;ive of their pacific de&s;ign. Their per&s;ons were held &s;acred and inviolable; they were con&s;idered as amenable to tho&s;e only who &s;ent them; they might mi&s;behave whil&s;t in an enemy's country, but this was not thought &s;ufficient to authori&s;e an enemy to puni&s;h them. The &s;tate to which they were &s;ent might, in this ca&s;e &s;end them home, or accu&s;e them to their ma&s;ters, who then became their judges or accomplices. The utility ari&s;ing from the intercour&s;e which was kept up
<PB N="7" REF="016311_0010_0F9C2B073914CEE8">
by tho&s;e per&s;ons, was not the only cau&s;e of their &s;afety: A &s;en&s;e of honour and public faith in the &s;tates to which they were &s;ent, contributed to it much more; for the&s;e were con&s;idered as plighted to pro|tect the man who came with a peaceful, &s;alutary in|tention, and voluntarily threw him&s;elf on the huma|nity of his enemies.</P>
<P>Were it nece&s;&s;ary I could fill pages with quota|tions from ancient authors, and from modern writers on the law of nations, to evince what is here a&s;&s;ert|ed. Their &s;uffrages are unanimous on this point; and tho&s;e &s;uffrages are &s;upported by cogent arguments and the practice of nations. Whoever chu&s;es it may turn to Grotius, Puffendorf, Buddeus, Barbeyrac, Burla|maqui or Monte&s;quieu, among foreigners, or to Selden, Hutchin&s;on or Rutherforth, of our own nation, and he will find their te&s;timony clear, united and deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>It may however be proper to produce an in&s;tance from hi&s;tory which will apply to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; of a multitude that occur, I &s;hall &s;elect one from the Roman hi&s;tory, at a period when, I dare &s;ay, you, Sir, and your a&s;&s;ociates mo&s;t admire the prin|ciples and conduct of that people&mdash;it was when they aboli&s;hed the Regal authority. Soon after Tarquin's expul&s;ion from Rome, he &s;ent deputies or amba&s;|&s;adors, that is, in modern language, per&s;ons with a flag of truce, to demand his effects: The depu|ties were admitted to an audience by the Senate, and the latter took &s;everal days to deliberate whether the demand &s;hould be granted or refu&s;ed. During this interval, Tarquin's deputies remained in the city, and meeting with &s;everal per&s;ons who were de&s;irous of re&s;toring the ancient government, entered into a plot with them for the purpo&s;e; the plan was regu|larly concerted&mdash;Tarquin was to be &s;ecretely admit|ted in the night&mdash;every thing was ready for execu|tion,
<PB N="8" REF="016311_0011_0F9C2B0A44BC6ED0">
when the whole was di&s;covered; and the ac|tive part which was taken by the king's deputies, that is, his officers bearing a flag of truce, was clearly detected and proved. What followed? Did the Romans judge that according to the law of na|tions,
<Q>the rights of a flag were forfeited by tho&s;e men thus detected in illicit practices;</Q>
and were they not accordingly impri&s;oned or put to death? No&mdash;quite the rever&s;e. <HI>De legatis,</HI> &s;ays Livy, in his conci&s;e way, <HI>paullulum addubitatum e&s;t; et quanquam vi&s;i &s;unt commi&s;&s;i&s;&s;e, ut ho&s;tium loce e&s;&s;ent, jus tamen gentium valuit.</HI> i. e. "For &s;ome time they (the Senate and Con&s;uls) were in &s;u&s;pen&s;e how to proceed with the amba&s;&s;adors or deputies; and al|though the latter de&s;erved to be treated as enemies, yet a regard to the law of nations prevailed."&mdash;Ac|cordingly, the deputies were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without injury.</P>
<P>Reflect on this ca&s;e, Sir, and compare the conduct of tho&s;e Romans, with yours in the affair before us. <HI>There,</HI> deputies from an abjured monarch, under the pretext of demanding his effects, entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the new government of Rome&mdash; even within its walls. They were detected in the con&s;piracy, their guilt was clearly proved; yet &s;uch was the re&s;pect paid by the Romans to the law of na|tions, and to the &s;acred character of Amba&s;&s;adors, that they &s;ent away tho&s;e con&s;pirators to their ma&s;ter, without offering them any violence. <HI>Here,</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Hele,</HI> on a much more intere&s;ting and important oc|ca&s;ion, (for <HI>he</HI> came with propo&s;itions to re&s;tore peace and re-unite a great empire, <HI>they</HI> only to demand &s;ome old furniture) approached your city; he came openly and undi&s;gui&s;ed, relying on that public faith and honour which had ever been the protection of per|&s;ons in his character; he engaged in no con&s;piracy; had no other intention than to deliver his di&s;patches; he was unfortunately wrecked: And you, without
<PB N="9" REF="016311_0012_0F9C2B0B4C2AE228">
compa&s;&s;ion for his misfortune, without regard to the character he bore, &s;eized him and flung him into a dungeon!</P>
<P>Really, Sir, the procedure of the Roman Senate is &s;o oppo&s;ite to that of the American Congre&s;s, in cir|cum&s;tances nearly re&s;embling each other, that one would be tempted to adopt the &s;entiments of the &s;ar|ca&s;tic <HI>Gulliver,</HI> at lea&s;t in <HI>one</HI> in&s;tance. Whil&s;t in the <HI>I&s;land of Sorcerers,</HI> where the Governor could &s;um|mon the dead to appear ju&s;t as they were when for|merly alive, Capt. <HI>Gulliver</HI>
<Q>de&s;ired that the Senate of Rome might appear before him in one large chamber, and a modern repre&s;entative in counter view, in another. The fir&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Gulliver,</HI> &s;eemed to be an a&s;&s;embly of heroes and demi-gods; the other a knot of pedlars, pick-pockets, highway-men and bullies.</Q></P>
<P>I grant indeed that there are precedents which you may plead&mdash;In&s;tances where Amba&s;&s;adors, and others in a &s;imilar character, have been impri&s;oned, nay, even murdered. But you will be plea&s;ed to remember, that this always happened through the violence of faction, or the brutality of &s;ome individuals. Every thing of this &s;ort has been condemned by the united voice of mankind, as di&s;honourable, impious <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Greeks, and other civili&s;ed nations of antiquity, be|lieved that the vengeance of Heaven pur&s;ued tho&s;e who offered violence to Amba&s;&s;adors or Heralds. Of this we have a re|markable in&s;tance in HERODOTUS, LIB. vii. Darius had &s;ent Heralds to &s;everal cities of Greece, demanding earth and water in token of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Some Spartans were &s;o tran&s;|ported with rage at this demand, that they flung the Heralds into a deep pit, bidding them carry earth and water thence; and there the Heralds peri&s;hed. The Spartans, when they cooly reflected on the matter, were heartily &s;orry for this vio|lent &s;tep, which was the effect of rage, and univer&s;ally con|demned; and being afterwards afflicted with heavy calamities, they attributed them to the anger of the Gods, for murdering the Per&s;ian Heralds. Two noble Spartans, Sperthies and Bulis, voluntarily offered to devote their lives, and thereby make &s;atisfaction for the death of tho&s;e Heralds, and avert the anger of the Gods. Accordingly they &s;et out for Per&s;ia, as if going to certain death; and when they informed Xerxes, the &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Darius, of their errand, he generou&s;ly re|plied,
<Q>That he would not imitate the Spartans, who had violated the rights of mankind by the injuries done to his father's Heralds&mdash;that he would not do the &s;ame thing which he condemned in them; nor by the death of two men, acquit the Spartans of the guilt they had contracted.</Q></NOTE> and con|trary

to the law of nations&mdash;has been di&s;approved and di&s;owned by the very people who were the aggre&s;&s;ors; and &s;ome of the bloodie&s;t wars recorded in hi&s;tory were undertaken on this account. Provoked by &s;uch an in&s;ult, David, King of I&s;rael, made war on the Ammonites, and took &s;evere revenge. For this &s;ole rea&s;on, the Romans entered into a war &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with the Veientes, Fidenates and Fali&s;ci, the Illyri|ans, Ligurians, &amp;c. to &s;ay nothing of other nations. And were there no other cau&s;e for pro&s;ecuting the pre&s;ent war with rigour, your treatment of Lieut. <HI>Hele</HI> would &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify our Sovereign in doing &s;o, until tho&s;e were brought to rea&s;on who pre&s;umed thus to in&s;ult his officers, and trample on the law of nations.</P>
<P>There is perhaps no part of the law of nations which hath been held more &s;acred by mankind, or that hath been more &s;trictly ob&s;erved, than that which regards the protection and liberty of Amba&s;&s;adors, and other me&s;&s;engers of peace, by whatever name di&s;tingui&s;hed, between ho&s;tile States. <HI>One</HI> in&s;tance&mdash;and one <HI>only</HI> &mdash;have I met with where it is &s;aid to be violated, with|out di&s;approbation, by any people:&mdash;It is by &s;ome of the &s;avage nations of this continent. <HI>Charlevoix,</HI> &s;peaking of &s;ome Indian tribes in North-America, when at war, &s;ays&mdash;
<Q>It becomes their Envoys or Plenipotentaries to exert their abilities and elo|quence;
<PB N="11" REF="016311_0014_0F9C2B0CF526F6D0">
for if the terms they offer are not accepted of, they had need to &s;tand on their guard. It fre|quently happens that a blow with an hatchet is the only return given to their propo&s;itions. They are not out of danger if they are even &s;o fortunate as to avoid the &s;troke; they may expect to be pur&s;ued, and if taken, to be burnt.</Q>
The ingenious Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI>'s ob&s;ervation on this pa&s;&s;age, is&mdash;
<Q>Men capable of &s;uch violence &s;eem to be unacquainted with the fir&s;t principles upon which the intercour&s;e between nations is founded.</Q>
Perhaps you will urge, that your conduct excells that of tho&s;e Indians, re&s;pecting the me&s;&s;engers of peace&mdash;that &s;eizing one of them is not &s;o bad as knocking him on the head with an hatchet&mdash;nor putting him in a dungeon &s;o atrocious as committing him to the flames. Be it &s;o; yet our feelings are greatly hurt to find that chri&s;tians and prote&s;tants are capable of acting a part which bears &s;o near a re&s;emblance to the brutal conduct of Savages&mdash;and in an in&s;tance where &s;o very few, even among Savages, will give it any countenance. You mu&s;t al&s;o allow on your part, that the Indians have the advantage of you in one re&s;pect: They permit the me&s;&s;enger of peace, who offends them, to depart, and thereby give him a chance for his liberty; where|as you in&s;tantly &s;eize, and put him in durance.</P>
<P>And this reminds me of another ob&s;ervation which your conduct hath often &s;ugge&s;ted. Among civilized nations, war is carried on with little or no animo&s;ity. The &s;ame principles and knowledge which &s;erve to refine and improve manners, in the peaceful &s;cenes of &s;ocial life, &s;erve al&s;o to &s;often the horrors of war, and preclude rage and re&s;entment from mingling with its operations. The rever&s;e of this is the ca&s;e of Sa|vages. In&s;tigated with relentle&s;s rancour, with un|bounded in&s;olence, to de&s;troy and exterminate is their object. I am &s;orry to &s;ay that the wanton cruelty
<PB N="12" REF="016311_0015_0F9C2B0D43746E10">
every where exerci&s;ed on loyali&s;ts, and the in&s;ults with which they are treated&mdash;that the illiberal &s;pirit, the rage and in&s;olence which &s;timulate your Congre&s;s and their adherents, with very few exceptions, and mark their proceedings, give rea&s;on to compare your con|duct with that of Savages in this in&s;tance al&s;o.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have rea&s;oned with you on the &s;uppo&s;i|tion, that this country was actually, and of right, in|dependent&mdash;that your Congre&s;s were ju&s;tly ve&s;ted with &s;upreme authority as the repre&s;entatives of America, and had been unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en as &s;uch by all the Americans. Even on this &s;uppo&s;ition, your treat|ment of Lieut <HI>Hele</HI> would not only be unju&s;tifiable, but highly criminal.</P>
<P>But &s;urely, Sir, you cannot in the fond hour of your greate&s;t &s;elf-importance and exaltation admit the &s;uppo&s;ition to be true. You cannot but know that King GEORGE WAS, and IS the rightful So|vereign of the&s;e colonies&mdash;that he &s;till claims their allegiance&mdash;that a large majority of the coloni&s;ts pre|fer his government to your tyrannical u&s;urpation&mdash; that not a TWENTIETH part of them have voted for your Congre&s;s&mdash;and that the members of the Congre&s;s them&s;elves, and their adherents, are revolted &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h crown. The&s;e facts are certainly true, whether you will admit them or not; nor can the Congre&s;s, with all their &s;ubtil artifice and tyranny, conceal them, or obliterate them from the minds of the good people of America.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the&s;e circum&s;tances for a moment, and how do they aggravate your crime! In how dete&s;table a light mu&s;t your conduct appear! The Gentleman whom you impri&s;oned, was a me&s;&s;enger of peace from your injured Sovereign. In vain did the law of na|tions throw its &s;hield over him, and promi&s;e him pro|tection:
<PB N="13" REF="016311_0016_0F9C2B0DFB9AB678">
You &s;purned that law, and were deaf to his remon&s;trances. He brought the mo&s;t liberal over|tures of accommodation&mdash;&s;uch as would make this country the happie&s;t and free&s;t upon earth: Yet equal|ly callous to the dictates of rea&s;on, duty, honour and humanity, you rejected tho&s;e overtures with di&s;dain, and doomed America to be a &s;cene of war, de&s;ola|tion and wretchedne&s;s, rather than re&s;ign that ideal importance which the temporary infatuation of a <HI>few</HI> had conferred on you. Nay, you added in&s;ult to re|bellion. You not only &s;hut the door again&s;t all fu|ture accommodation, &s;o far as in you lay; but by an act ever held in dete&s;tation among civilized nations, and deemed the mo&s;t provoking, you have ju&s;tified the &s;evere&s;t retaliation that Britain can make! Hither|to, her aim was to reclaim, not to de&s;troy, or even to conquer: You have done all in your power to com|pel her to adopt different mea&s;ures; and you have probably entailed on this country a war, who&s;e de|&s;olating ravages may not cea&s;e but with the utter ruin of America.</P>
<P>But I turn from the horrid &s;ubject with di&s;gu&s;t; and as this letter is already protracted to a &s;ufficient length, &s;hall defer my <HI>&s;trictures</HI> on the remaining part of your <HI>an&s;wer</HI> to &s;ome future opportunity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. To HENRY LAURENS, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<P>IN my former <HI>&s;trictures</HI> I pointed out how fla|grantly you had violated the law of nations by the detention and impri&s;onment of Lieutenant HELE of
<PB N="14" REF="016311_0017_0F9C2B0EC1360F00">
the Hotham &s;loop, bearing a flag of Truce. I &s;hall now examine the remaining part of your <HI>an&s;|wer</HI> to Admiral GAMBIER's letter, where you at|tempt to ju&s;tify a conduct which cannot be defended. This however is not the only in&s;tance wherein you have trampled on the law of nations and broken your public faith, in your independent capacity. Witne&s;s your breach of the &s;tipulation at the <HI>Cedars,</HI> of the convention at <HI>Saratoga,</HI> which will ever brand the Congre&s;s with the blacke&s;t and mo&s;t indelible infamy.</P>
<P>To manife&s;t the inju&s;tice of your procedure, Ad|miral GAMBIER had urged,
<Q>That the re&s;olution on which the Congre&s;s now wi&s;h to ju&s;tify them|&s;elves is &s;ub&s;equent in date to the fact of which they complain.</Q>
You do not deny this fact, and con&s;equently, admit the charge. This, of it&s;elf, is &s;ufficient to expo&s;e the iniquity of your conduct; for what can be more contrary to ju&s;tice, right, and rea&s;on, than to judge an action by a law which was made after the action was committed, and then pu|ni&s;h the per&s;on for that action, as if the law had been previou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed, and the action a voluntary tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of it? Can any thing be conceived more ty|rannical?</P>
<P>A law may be defined&mdash;<HI>the will of tho&s;e who are ve&s;ted with authority, requiring certain actions, and forbidding others, and guarded or enforced by &s;anctions of rewards and puni&s;hments.</HI> An action, which is neither forbidden nor required by any law, is in its nature indifferent. We are permitted to do what is forbidden by no law; we may neglect whatever is not enjoined by any law; and hence that indubitable maxim&mdash;<HI>where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion.</HI> It evidently follows then, that laws, in order to be binding, &s;hould be &s;ufficiently promulged or
<PB N="15" REF="016311_0018_0F9C2B0F761152E8">
made known to tho&s;e who are to obey them&mdash;and that a law cannot rightly take cognizance of any actions but &s;uch as are &s;ub&s;equent to its date or pro|mulgation.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, it is no wonder that Admiral GAMBIER, or any other per&s;on of integrity and good &s;en&s;e, who&s;e object was truth, who was not conver|&s;ant in the chicane of verbal di&s;putation and &s;ophi&s;try,
<Q>&s;hould imagine it difficult in the eyes of the candid world to explain away that paragraph,</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Admiral's letter of December <HI>25,</HI> to <HI>Mr. Lau|rens,</HI> which was publi&s;hed after my fir&s;t <HI>&s;trictures</HI> were &s;ent to the Printer.</NOTE> which I have before quoted. You have attempted to do this by &s;aying&mdash;
<Q>that the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, au|thori&s;ing the &s;eizure of the flag, being &s;ub&s;equent to the fact complained of in that re&s;olution, re|quire <HI>(requires)</HI> no ju&s;tification; the fact mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily precede both the complaint and the mea&s;ures for preventing the con&s;equences of the fact.</Q></P>
<P>Very well, Sir! and pray what then? Is this any an&s;wer to the Admiral's argument? or does it re|move the charge brought again&s;t you, viz. judging and condemning Lieut. HELE by a <HI>po&s;t facto</HI> law or re&s;olution? Not in the lea&s;t&mdash;His argument is un|an&s;wered, his charge unremoved. You have given us the cloudy &s;ubtilty of old &s;choolmen, joined to the di&s;ingenuous, perplexing quibble of &s;ophi&s;ts; but no refutation of the plea that was &s;o ju&s;tly urged again&s;t you: And if any man can extract one grain of con&s;i&s;tent, &s;en&s;e or candour from this an&s;wer, he is welcome to it for his pains.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="016311_0019_0F9C2B1085439C48">But let us take a nearer view of this dark <HI>re&s;pon&s;e,</HI> and try to di&s;cover its meaning, if perchance it has any.</P>
<P>You &s;ay&mdash;
<Q>that the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, au|thori&s;ing the &s;eizure of the flag, being &s;ub&s;equent to the fact complained of in that re&s;olution, re|quires no ju&s;tification.</Q>
No, Sir! I am humbly of opinion it does. I think, and am confident the candid world will think with me, that it requires a very full and &s;atisfactory ju&s;tification. If you mean that &s;eizing, trying and puni&s;hing a man for an action which was committed before the date of the law by virtue of which he is &s;eized, and by which he is tried, condemned and puni&s;hed&mdash;if you mean, I &s;ay, that this is a thing &s;o evidently right and ju&s;t in it&s;elf as not to &s;tand in need of ju&s;tification, it is an in&s;ult on the under&s;tanding of mankind; for there are few points perhaps in which mankind are better agreed than in reprobating &s;uch a procedure as unju&s;t, cruel and tyrannical.&mdash;You conde&s;cend however to a&s;&s;ign what, I pre&s;ume, you intended &s;hould pa&s;s for a rea|&s;on why "it requires no ju&s;tification;" and certain|ly, a reader who is dive&s;ted of prejudice, and capable of rea&s;oning, would naturally expect one very cogent &mdash;for cogent it mu&s;t be which could induce him to acquie&s;ce in a po&s;ition &s;o extraordinary. What then mu&s;t his di&s;appointment and indignation be, when he finds that rea&s;on to be a poor, contemptible quibble! For, &s;ay you,&mdash;
<Q>the fact mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily precede both the complaint and the mea&s;ures for prevent|ing the con&s;equences of the fact.</Q></P>
<P>But, Sir, this is only a play upon words&mdash;a mere eva&s;ion. The charge exhibited again&s;t you was the puni&s;hing a man by a re&s;olution, who&s;e date was &s;ub&s;equent to the fact he was tried for. Your an&s;wer
<PB N="17" REF="016311_0020_0F9C2B13C5DEF1E8">
does not reach this charge; nor, if it did, would it ju&s;tify you. Suppo&s;ing what you &s;ay were univer|&s;ally true, as your words imply, (though in many in&s;tances it is fal&s;e) yet it &s;hews no more than this &mdash;that on complaint of certain facts, it frequently happens, and it is proper that due mea&s;ures be taken &mdash;pa&s;s laws, re&s;olutions, &amp;c.&mdash;to prevent the con|&s;equences of &s;imilar facts in future. All this was very evident before your involved reply made its appear|ance; but it can &s;hew no more, with re&s;pect to the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, without contradicting the cleare&s;t principles of equity and ju&s;tice&mdash;it does not &s;hew that the action which preceded the re&s;olution is rightly puni&s;hable by it.</P>
<P>Were your an&s;wer to be con&s;idered merely in the light of a ca&s;ual repartee, which, by a jingle of words, would parry the attack of a bri&s;k antagoni&s;t, it might pa&s;s without cen&s;ure. But for a body of men who a&s;&s;ume the re&s;pectable character of legi&s;lators, and patrons of liberty, truth and virtue, &s;olemnly to advance &s;uch flim&s;y &s;ophi&s;try, in a matter of the utmo&s;t moment, and with the de&s;ign of ju&s;tifying an atrocious crime, is truly &s;hocking; it di&s;covers an utter di&s;regard of truth, of the dignity of that character they a&s;&s;ume; it manife&s;ts a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having a bad cau&s;e, which could not be vindicated by fair rea&s;oning, and that the charge could only be eluded by quibbling. Away then with &s;uch trifling! It would di&s;grace and injure a good cau&s;e; it &s;erves to make a bad one and its abettors more dete&s;table; &s;uch men &s;hould not obtrude them&s;elves thus on the world, which is too knowing to be amu&s;ed with petulance and &s;ophi&s;try; they &s;hould retire where they ought, to their ploughs and trades; or repo&s;e with their quibbling brethren of the &s;chools

in the corner of a gothic cloi&s;ter, dark as their un|der&s;tanding, cold and unfeeling as their hearts.</P>
<P>A fact was alledged which contained a heavy charge again&s;t Congre&s;s; they admitted the fact, for it was too notorious to be denied. The <HI>proclamation</HI> in que&s;tion was dated October 3; Lieutenant HELE, in the Hotham &s;loop, &s;ailed from New-York with that proclamation the 5th of the &s;ame month, and two or three days carried him to the Delaware, where he was wrecked; The <HI>re&s;olution</HI> of Congre&s;s, by virtue of which he was &s;eized and flung into a dungeon, was dated October 16, &s;everal days after his di&s;a&s;ter: Thus &s;tands the fact, which you could not deny, but try to an&s;wer it by a play on the &s;ound of words, and &s;neak off with the pitiful &s;ubterfuge we have been con&s;idering. Had you repeated tho&s;e ludicrous lines&mdash;</P>
<L>"The longitude mi&s;t on</L>
<L>"By wicked Will Whi&s;ton,</L>
<L>"And no better hit on</L>
<L>"By Grave Ma&s;ter Ditton," &amp;c. &amp;c.</L>
<P>They would have been as pertinent, fair and &s;atis|factory an an&s;wer as the one you have returned.</P>
<P>The charge of &s;eizing an officer with a flag of truce and puni&s;hing him by virtue of a <HI>re&s;olution</HI> which was pa&s;&s;ed not only after the date of his di&s;|patches and his departure from New-York, but even after his arrival in Delaware, contrary to every principle of equity and ju&s;tice&mdash;This charge, I &s;ay, remains in full force. You have prudently declined the vindication of it, and left it to &s;hift for it&s;elf&mdash; But I ha&s;ten to the next part of your an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Admiral GAMBIER had &s;aid,
<Q>the Manife&s;to in que&s;tion was addre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the Congre&s;s them&s;elves, and could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;e|ditious.</Q>
<PB N="19" REF="016311_0022_0F9C2B16074EA6B8">
This with the preceding facts and argu|ments had been urged, not only in oppo&s;ition to what was a&s;&s;erted in your re&s;olution of October 16, but to &s;hew that your detention and impri&s;onment of Lieut. HELE was, in every point of view, and in all its circum&s;tances, contrary to ju&s;tice and rea&s;on. To this allegation, you an&s;wer,
<Q>that addre&s;&s;ing the Manife&s;to in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to Congre&s;s, does not prove that it was not &s;editious, &s;ince it was at the &s;ame time addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies of the United States, to the clergy, to the officers of the American army, and to the people at large, which inconte&s;tably &s;hews it to be &s;editious and unwarrantable.</Q></P>
<P>I apprehend that the contents, the purport and de&s;ign of the manife&s;to &s;hould decide whether it was &s;editious or otherwi&s;e; and not the per&s;ons, of what de&s;cription or number &s;oever they might be, to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. Were this la&s;t to determine the point, as your words &s;eem to intimate, then the Congre&s;s, by their own rule, have i&s;&s;ued many <HI>&s;e|ditious</HI> manife&s;tos; for it is certain that long before they had thrown a&s;ide their allegiance, and whil&s;t they were &s;olemnly invoking heaven and earth to wit|ne&s;s the &s;incerity of their profe&s;&s;ions and loyalty, the Congre&s;s addre&s;&s;ed &s;everal manife&s;tos not only to the inhabitants of North-America, but to tho&s;e of Great-Britain and Ireland, including all ranks and deno|minations. Is the Congre&s;s then, like the wicked &s;ervant, condemned out of its own mouth?</P>
<P>If we look into the manife&s;to we &s;hall find its contents to be the rever&s;e of &s;editious. It exhorts not to war or tumults, but to peace and order; it holds out the mo&s;t liberal overtures for accommoda+tion, a full redre&s;s of every grievance, would put a
<PB N="20" REF="016311_0023_0F9C2B164A6652B0">
&s;top to the effu&s;ion of kindred blood, and arre&s;t the ravages of war in their de&s;olating career, and recom|mends the&s;e intere&s;ting matters to the "&s;erious con|&s;ideration of all." Is this the language of &s;edition? Is this the &s;pirit it breathes? Are the&s;e the objects at which it aims?</P>
<P>But were the matter as you affirm, and the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent forth this manife&s;to with a &s;editious de&s;ign, I mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay, that they are un&s;kilful proficients in the trade of &s;edition, and they ought to have profited by your example; for the world mu&s;t allow that you, Sir, and your a&s;&s;oci|ates are very able practitioners in that <HI>noble art.</HI> En|lightened by your tenets, and guided by your practice, they &s;hould have pur&s;ued mea&s;ures totally different from tho&s;e they adopted.</P>
<P>Let us however drop this point, and for the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;e the manife&s;to was &s;editious, (making all due allowance for the bungling manner of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners on this plan) yet &s;till your treatment of Lieut. HELE is utterly indefen&s;ible. The Manife&s;to, in the preamble, was fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed to you; orders were al&s;o given that it &s;hould be delivered to you <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &mdash;Circum&s;tances which &s;hould fully remove all &s;u&s;|picions of &s;edition, either in the contents or de&s;ign.</P>
<P>You were ve&s;ted with &s;upreme power over the <HI>thir|teen united &s;tates,</HI> as you call them, and the Mani|fe&s;to was to come <HI>fir&s;t</HI> into your hands. Were not you therefore to judge of its contents&mdash;to circulate or &s;uppre&s;s them as you thought proper? You might receive or reject the Manife&s;to; but what right did this give you to puni&s;h the innocent officer who brought it by order of his &s;uperior, and who knew not the contents? Had Lieut. HELE been even detect|ed
<PB N="21" REF="016311_0024_0F9C2B170938BBA8">
in circulating the manife&s;to privately, I have &s;hewn from the practice of the Romans in an in&s;tance which not only comes up to that ca&s;e, but goes beyond it, that you would not thereby be authori&s;ed to puni&s;h him; much le&s;s when he came without any &s;uch de&s;ign, and was wrecked on his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But &s;ay you&mdash;
<Q>the manife&s;to was addre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;emblies, clergy, officers, and the people at large.</Q>
True&mdash;the contents concerned all, was it not right therefore to reccommend them to the "&s;erious con&s;ideration of all?" And had not you, to whom they were fir&s;t directed, full power to give them currency, like your pa&s;te-board dollars, or over-rule them, as you plea&s;ed?</P>
<P>Here, Sir, your vindication is your reproach, and betrays a &s;ecret you have long &s;trove to conceal. A &s;ubject happened to be touched which lay very near your heart&mdash;you took the alarm, and your frame was &s;hocked. Nature got the better of your prudence, and the ruling pa&s;&s;ion which actuates you in all your mea&s;ures, involuntarily &s;tarteth up to view. The vulgar proverb &s;ays&mdash;<HI>It is dangerous to talk of a halter before a man who&s;e father was hanged</HI>&mdash;it is equally &s;o, I find, to hint at any thing before u&s;urpers, which even by a forced con&s;truction, might be thought to call their &s;upremacy in que&s;tion. The lu&s;t of domination is a very unruly pa&s;&s;ion; when it hath once taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the human brea&s;t, it will &s;oon &s;ubjugate all others, break through every re&s;traint, and pu&s;h men on to perpetrate the greate&s;t enormities.</P>
<P>Is then the doctrine of <HI>ab&s;olute pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non re&s;i&s;tance</HI> &s;o current among you already? and are you &s;o eager to have it enforced? According to the fundamental articles of your &s;y&s;tem, the people
<PB N="22" REF="016311_0025_0F9C2B17C47F7958">
are the fountain of all authority and power; this was a convenient doctrine till you were fairly and firmly &s;eated on the pinnacle of power to which you a&s;pired. But is it prudent to turn &s;hort &s;o &s;uddenly, and treat the people as your va&s;&s;als, before the con|te&s;t is quite ended? Should you kick away the ladder &s;o ha&s;tily? Or is it right to prevent the people from taking into "&s;erious con&s;ideration," matters which next to their everla&s;ting &s;alvation, are of greate&s;t mo|ment, and concern them mo&s;t nearly?

Very true, Sir. By looking into your famous re&s;olution of October 16, I find you have done &s;o; but you took care previou&s;ly to give a decided judgment of tho&s;e papers. You pronounced them
<Q>&s;editious&mdash;&s;ent with a view to &s;tir up di&s;&s;entions, animo&s;ities, and rebellion among the people.</Q>
You thus &s;et them down in your <HI>index expurgatorius</HI>; and effectually prevented their being read to any good purpo&s;e.&mdash; Henceforward, every mouth was clo&s;ed that would &s;peak in their behalf, and every hand arre&s;ted that would move for their producing any &s;alutary effect. The iron &s;courge of tyranny&mdash;fines, impri&s;onment or death, entirely re&s;trained both. This you know was the ca&s;e; and that the people were not per|mitted to deliberate impartially about them, or to act as they cho&s;e. The privilege of &s;peaking or writing their &s;entiments, or acting according to their judge|ment, is re&s;erved for your warm partizans only.</P>
<P>It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, how naturally people, engaged in the &s;ame pur&s;uits, &s;lide into the &s;ame mea|&s;ures for effecting their purpo&s;e.

This <HI>Declaration</HI> fell into the hands of JAMES; and after in&s;erting his judgment of it&mdash;that it was <HI>&s;editious&mdash;&s;ent with a view to &s;tir up di&s;&s;entions, animo&s;ities and rebellion among the peo|ple</HI>&mdash;Like you, he <HI>recommended it to be printed and di&s;per&s;ed.</HI> I could point out the exacte&s;t re&s;emblance between your mea&s;ures, &s;pirit and conduct, and tho&s;e of the leaders in the grand rebellion in the la&s;t century; which indeed any per&s;on may do by con&s;ulting <HI>Cla|rendon</HI>'s hi&s;tory.

<P>BY contemptuou&s;ly rejecting the late liberal overtures of accommodation&mdash;the mo&s;t liberal perhaps that were ever held out by an injured Sovereign to revolted &s;ubjects, the Congre&s;s mean to continue the calamities of America; and by the violation of every obligation, human and divine, and adding the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in&s;ults to their other enormities, they &s;eemingly intend to increa&s;e them.</P>

<P>In each of the&s;e I find my&s;elf injured.

<P>In&s;tead of this, you have prepo&s;terou&s;ly united <HI>Gallic</HI> perfidy with the coar&s;e, ill-bred ru&s;ticity which is peculiar to the dregs of our countrymen!</P>
<P>I am ready to make all due allowance for the di&s;|tre&s;s of your &s;ituation. It was impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer Sir HENRY's letter as it ought, and not comply with his requi&s;ition. But could you not turn it off with a little &s;ophi&s;try and quibbling, as in the ca&s;e of Lieu|tenant Hele, rather than expo&s;e your&s;elves to the contempt of mankind by &s;o brutal an an&s;wer? Was your invention &s;o much jaded that nothing could be contrived to avoid the manners and language of ruf|fians? Might not &s;omething be conjured up again&s;t the convention troops that would have been as per|tinent, ju&s;t, and weighty, as the affair of the cartouch boxes, to ea&s;e you of &s;o heavy a load of &s;candal and reproach?</P>
<P>Sir HENRY CLINTON, hath intimated a reluc|tance
<Q>to trouble you or the Congre&s;s again on the &s;ubject of the convention troops.</Q>
Probably he was convinced of your determination not to hearken to rea&s;on&mdash;that any further application would be fruitle&s;s&mdash;that nothing but in&s;ult could be expected from men who had repeatedly manife&s;ted a di&s;regard of public faith, a want of delicacy and di&s;tinction of per&s;ons; and every one knows, that
<Q>a bear in the
<PB N="35" REF="016311_0038_0F9C2B23B52028A0">
wilderne&s;s will as &s;oon fix on a philo&s;opher as on a cottager.</Q>
In compliance, however, with the King's in&s;tructions, Sir HENRY wrote to you, and the event fully ju&s;tified his apprehen&s;ions. With re|&s;pect to you, this was one of tho&s;e critical junctures which nece&s;&s;arily require a conduct and mea&s;ures that develope the heart, and decide the character. You took your mea&s;ures, and they were deci&s;ive on tho&s;e points. We &s;ee the grote&s;que figure which men, new to power, and void of honour, are always ob|&s;erved to make on &s;uch occa&s;ions. We &s;ee that mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting &s;pecies of pride and in&s;olence&mdash;the low-bred in&s;olence and pride of u&s;urpers, who occu|py a &s;tation for which they are by nature, education and principle, utterly di&s;qualified; and de&s;titute of that addre&s;s, tho&s;e engaging poli&s;hed manners which are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;often, and reconcile to us the &s;tern a&s;pect of power.</P>
<P>I am not con&s;cious of having repre&s;ented your con|duct in this matter more unfavourably than it de|&s;erves, or in a wor&s;e light than it will be viewed by every impartial man of &s;en&s;e and good breeding; even &s;eparate from your flagitious violation of the Sarato|ga convention. But when that con&s;ideration is added, it forms &s;uch a complication of perfidy and rudene&s;s, as cannot be matched in the annals of any nation.</P>
<P>It was my intention to have added &s;ome furthet <HI>&s;trictures</HI> on your manner of ob&s;erving treaties; but want of time will not admit of it now&mdash;they &s;hall wait on you &s;ome future day. In the mean time, I &s;hall pre&s;ent you with the following extract from Plutarch's treati&s;e concerning <HI>an ignorant, untutored ruler,</HI> that is, one di&s;qualified for his &s;tation by na|ture and education. It is very pertinent to the &s;ub|ject before us, and may &s;erve to <HI>amu&s;e</HI> you. After

ob&s;erving that tho&s;e among the lower cla&s;&s;es of man|kind, who are viciou&s;ly inclined, cannot, through inability in their humble &s;tate, do much mi&s;chief; but when, by any accident, they are rai&s;ed to power, prove very pernicious to &s;ociety, Plutarch proceeds thus&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>The vices of men ve&s;ted with power cannot be concealed. For as per&s;ons who labour under a certain kind of epilep&s;y, are &s;eized, when expo&s;ed to the cold, with a giddine&s;s, and their di&s;order is betrayed by the agitation of their bodies; &s;o, when fortune hath exalted vain and ignorant men, conferring wealth, honour, and power, on &s;uch up&s;tarts, &s;he al&s;o gives &s;ure indications of their di&s;po&s;ition and fall. Moreover, as among empty ve&s;&s;els, it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h which is &s;ound, or which is leaky; but on pouring in &s;ome liquid, tho&s;e that have a flaw are di&s;covered by the liquor flowing out; thus weak minds cannot bear pow|er&mdash;their flaws become manife&s;t&mdash;they bur&s;t forth with inordiuate de&s;ires, in acts of rage, ar|rogance, perfidy, and petulant folly.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. To JOHN JAY, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU would probably think your&s;elf neglected, and unju&s;tly deprived of that notice to which you are entitled, were I to pa&s;s you over in &s;ilence when ex|amining the conduct of your Congre&s;s.&mdash;Certain it is that &s;ome tran&s;actions of that body &s;ince you were <HI>dig|nified</HI> with the title of its Pre&s;ident, de&s;erve the &s;erious attention of all Americans. As you have &s;ucceeded to the &s;eat lately occupied by Mr. <HI>Laurens,</HI> I hope he will not be di&s;plea&s;ed if I direct my future corre&s;pondence to you. He has no ju&s;ter claim than you to my no|tice; and happily for me, who have no talent for adulation, I find my&s;elf under as little temptation of the kind when writing to the one as to the other. Be&s;ides, as Mr. <HI>Laurens</HI> may by this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About this time, the province of Georgia was reduced <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the forces &s;ent for that purpo&s;e, commanded by Colonel <HI>CAMPBELL:</HI> and Mr. <HI>Laurens,</HI> an inhabitant of Charles-Town in South-Carolina, returned home, after re&s;igning <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eat as Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s; and was &s;ucceeded by Mr. <HI>Jay.</HI></NOTE> time have &s;ome <HI>trouble&s;ome vi&s;itants</HI> pretty near him, he will have &s;omething el&s;e to <HI>amu&s;e</HI> him.</P>
<P>I frankly own it is with pain I addre&s;s you as a u&s;urper. Your fir&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions led you a very
<PB N="38" REF="016311_0041_0F9C2B296EB11448">
different way from what you have been lately, and are now pur&s;uing. The morning of your life was &s;erene and bright. Science di&s;covered to your open|ing mind the road which leads to eminence and hap|pine&s;s. You imbibed generous principles of virtue and honour, of religion and liberty, if at certain intervals &s;ome &s;allies appeared which indicated ma|lignity of temper, or inordinate pride and ambition, the partiality of your friends willingly attributed them to the ardour and inexperience of youth; whatever &s;hade they might throw over your better qualities, yet the latter, joined to the abilities for which you had credit, were &s;uppo&s;ed to overbalance them; for your talents, though not the mo&s;t &s;hining, were &s;ufficient to gain re&s;pect, and make you a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e tran&s;ient ebullitions of ambition, malignity and pride were clearly perceived by the more di&s;cern|ing, and con&s;iderably damped their expectations of your future worth; nor were they deceived. Unfor|tunately for you, the troubles of this unhappy period pre&s;ented an occa&s;ion for calling tho&s;e dark pa&s;&s;ions into action; cheri&s;hed at the &s;ame time by your con|nections with bad, unprincipled men, they &s;oon ac|quired &s;trength, laid your virtues pro&s;trate, and gave the predominant colour to your character. Tired and di&s;&s;atisfied with the &s;ober path of loyalty, and duties of a good citizen, you a&s;pired to be among the founders of a new empire. You entered indeed with reluctance into the dete&s;table &s;chemes of the babel builders of Congre&s;s; and no wonder, for they were directly oppo&s;ite to all your fir&s;t principles. But your efforts to &s;ubdue tho&s;e principles have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|ful that you now figure among the foremo&s;t in the <HI>glorious</HI> work of rebellion, and ruining your country.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="016311_0042_0F9C2B29C1B940F0">It would &s;eem however that you &s;till have &s;ome &s;evere conflicts. Men cannot ea&s;ily eradicate their former impre&s;&s;ions, nor become wicked in the extreme all at once. A trouble&s;ome gue&s;t within them, will, in the calm hour of reflection, be obtruding advice, remon&s;trating again&s;t their conduct, and laying open their guilt. Accordingly, you have repeatedly de|clared that in your political conduct <HI>you</HI> KNEW <HI>that you &s;inned</HI>; but always gallantly added&mdash;<HI>and by G-d I am determined to &s;in on!</HI> Agitated thus between the lu&s;t of power and a &s;en&s;e of duty, goaded by ambition and checked by con&s;cience, your &s;ituation is truly dreadful! The perpetual dictator&s;hip of America would be a poor compen&s;ation for the angui&s;h and ter|rors that are in&s;eparable from it. You are a melan|choly proof how dangerous it is to depart <HI>knowingly</HI> from the path of rectitude; and I mu&s;t tell you that the gentleman who grew tired of buckling and un|buckling his &s;hoes, and therefore hanged him&s;elf, found out a more effectual, and le&s;s pernicious method of removing his di&s;content.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e things as they afford a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to tho&s;e who would &s;tudy human nature, and guard again&s;t the irregular motions of the heart, which may carry us, if not re&s;trained, to the mo&s;t de&s;perate ex|tremities. Such as feel the force of tho&s;e generous attachments which are contracted in youth, will readily make allowance for my enlarging on them; for I really lament your deviations from rectitude and duty.</P>
<P>You are now &s;eated in the pre&s;ident's chair, and have reached the &s;ummit of that power to which you a&s;pired&mdash;as high, at lea&s;t, as it would be convenient to avow at pre&s;ent. Soon after your exaltation, a &s;cene was brought forward which was very trying and difficult. Like &s;ome other late occurrences, it impo|&s;ed
<PB N="40" REF="016311_0043_0F9C2B2A805BA4F0">
a nece&s;&s;ity on your Congre&s;s of taking mea&s;ures which were deci&s;ive of their character and de&s;igns, and expo&s;ed things to public view, which they would willingly have concealed.</P>
<P>Your officious friend, Mr. <HI>Paine,</HI> happened to make this wonderful di&s;covery&mdash;that the Congre&s;s was <HI>fallible,</HI> and that its members, like other folks, could pur&s;ue their private intere&s;t and emolument to the detriment of the public. This di&s;covery was &s;o new and extraordinary to him, that he made it known to the world; and con&s;idering the &s;ugar-plumbs with which he had &s;o long treated the Congre&s;s, this mu&s;t have been a very bitter pill to them.</P>
<P>But this was not all. Among other things he flung out &s;ome hints which the <HI>Syndic</HI> i. e. the <HI>Town Clerk</HI> of <HI>Stra&s;burg,</HI> deemed incompatible with the views of his ma&s;ter. That the&s;e colonies &s;hould have the privilege of making the be&s;t terms for them&s;elves, and &s;ettling the conte&s;t with Britain in the manner that would be lea&s;t injurious to their honour and in|tere&s;t, however rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, yet Mr. <HI>Gerard</HI> well knew was never the de&s;ign or purpo&s;e of the French king. For two centuries pa&s;t, France hath been the common incendiary of Europe&mdash;the plague of every neighbouring &s;tate, by interfering and em|broiling their affairs, to &s;erve her own ambitious pur|po&s;es. She is now playing the &s;ame game in America that &s;he played a thou&s;and times before in Europe; but had
<Q>the United States pre&s;erved the liberty of treating with Great-Britain &s;eparately from their ally, as long as Great-Britain had not declared war again&s;t M. <HI>Gerard</HI>'s ma&s;ter,</Q>
as Mr. <HI>Paine</HI> &s;ug|ge&s;ted, M. <HI>Gerard</HI> was con&s;cious that the de&s;igns of his ma&s;ter and of France would be wholly defeated. Accordingly, the <HI>Syndic</HI> took fire at the pretended
<PB N="41" REF="016311_0044_0F9C2B2B459031C0">
indignity offered to his ma&s;ter, and demanded an explanation from the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>With all the de&s;potic power exerci&s;ed by your Con|gre&s;s, they were afraid to di&s;avow &s;o ju&s;t and equita|ble a po&s;ition; they were &s;till more afraid to hazard the &s;ub&s;equent declaration which rivetted the chains of America, and mu&s;t rou&s;e the indignation of all who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any &s;en&s;e of national dignity or Briti&s;h freedom. You therefore evaded the demand for &s;ome time; but M. <HI>Gerard</HI> was peremptory, and at la&s;t bullied you into a compliance. You fir&s;t <HI>explicitly di&s;avowed</HI> the obnoxious <HI>publications</HI> of Mr. <HI>Paine,</HI> and the <HI>a&s;&s;ertions</HI> contained in them; and among others, <HI>the liberty of treating with Britain,</HI> above mentioned. This was done Jan. 12th; but the <HI>Syndic,</HI> who was no &s;tranger to the art of chicane and duplicity, and therefore the better qualified to guard again&s;t yours, was not &s;atisfied with this di&s;avowal, although into the bargain, <HI>Paine</HI> was &s;acrificed to his re&s;entment. Even your <HI>ob&s;equious</HI> epi&s;tle could not &s;ooth him, un|til &s;omething more explicit&mdash;&s;omething that would more effectually &s;erve his ma&s;ter's de&s;igns, was pro|duced. You were compelled to give way, and, like a French Parliament <HI>regi&s;tering an Edict,</HI> you re&s;ol|ved as follows, Jan. 14.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Whereas it hath been repre&s;ented to this Hou&s;e by the Hon. Sieur Gerard, Mini&s;ter Plenipotenti|ary of France, that <HI>it is pretended the United States have pre&s;erved the liberty of treating with Great Britain &s;eparately from their ally, as long as Great Britain &s;hall not have declared war again&s;t his ma&s;ter</HI>; therefore re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That, as neither France or the&s;e United States may of right, &s;o the&s;e United States will not, conclude either
<PB N="42" REF="016311_0045_0F9C2B2C28E832D0">
truce or peace with the common enemy, without the formal con&s;ent of their ally fir&s;t obtained.</Q></P>
<P>It were needle&s;s to dwell on the palpable contra|diction between this <HI>re&s;olve</HI> and your declarations to the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners, or even the articles of al|liance with France which you were plea&s;ed to publi&s;h formerly. Such incon&s;i&s;tency cannot now di&s;grace the Congre&s;s. One alledged cau&s;e for your entering into this rebellion was the legal toleration of Popery in Canada, according to the expre&s;s &s;tipulation of a public treaty; yet you afterwards offered a compleat e&s;tabli&s;hment of their religion to the Canadians, pro|vided they would join in the rebellion&mdash;You &s;olemn|ly appealed to Heaven for the &s;incerity of your pro|&s;e&s;&s;ions when declaring your&s;elves loyal, affectionate &s;ubjects of the King; and you made the &s;ame &s;olemn appeal when declaring that he was a mo&s;t execrable tyrant, and that you would have no further connecti|on with him. I could adduce many other in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind to &s;hew that the above contradiction is of a piece with the re&s;t of your conduct, which is marked in every part with duplicity and deceit. To what a ble&s;&s;ed &s;ituation have you reduced the Ame|ricans by this mode of procedure when you tell them that <HI>they have not pre&s;erved,</HI> nor mu&s;t they even <HI>pretend they have pre&s;erved the liberty of making a truce or peace without the formal con&s;ent of France!</HI> When in &s;uch a &s;tate of thraldom to France, what can remain of any value!</P>
<P>The peculiarity of your &s;ituation in this bu&s;ine&s;s is worthy of notice. By the perfidious revocation of the edict of Nantz, contrary to public faith and ho|nour, the fury of Popi&s;h bigotry, armed with &s;ecular power, was let loo&s;e again&s;t the prote&s;tants of France. Not le&s;s than a <HI>million</HI> of them were put to the &s;word,
<PB N="43" REF="016311_0046_0F9C2B3085277D10">
or bani&s;hed into foreign countries; be&s;ides many millions more who were compelled to abjure their religion. Among others, your ance&s;tors were driven from their native land; &s;tript of all their property, like poor loyali&s;ts in our day, they &s;ought an a&s;ylum in the Briti&s;h dominions. They found an ho&s;pitable reception in America, a part of tho&s;e dominions, and full protection from their relentle&s;s per&s;ecutors. How perver&s;e your de&s;tiny, Sir, to be made the in&s;trument of in&s;ulting the memory, the faith and fortitude of the&s;e your pious ance&s;tors, by now crouching to their per&s;ecutors, by pronouncing their protectors your enemies! Were I capable of harbouring the mo&s;t rancorous malice, and were that malice directed again&s;t you, it could not be more amply gratified than by the part you acted on this occa&s;ion, as &s;poke&s;man of the Congre&s;s&mdash;offering incen&s;e to, and throwing your|&s;elves at the feet of, that in&s;idious crown which has extingui&s;hed liberty, and extirpated the prote&s;tant religion in all its territories&mdash;and at the &s;ame time, not only outraging, but like paricides, impiou&s;ly plotting the ruin of your parent &s;tate, where more liberty exi&s;ts than in any other &s;tate in chri&s;tendom, and which is the principal &s;upport of the prote&s;tant religion!</P>
<P>But whatever di&s;grace this affair may reflect on you, and on the Congre&s;s, its con&s;equences are more &s;eri|ous and fatal to the American coloni&s;ts&mdash;according to your <HI>re&s;olve,</HI> they are in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage to France. You have declared that <HI>they cannot of right, and &s;hall not conclude either truce or peace with the common enemy,</HI> i. e. with their rightful &s;overeign, <HI>without the formal con&s;ent of their ally,</HI> meaning the French King, <HI>fir&s;t obtained.</HI> So that whatever overtures are made by Britain to the colonies, however beneficial or honour|able to them, it matters not. As long as its &s;uits the ambition, caprice, intere&s;t or policy of France, &s;o
<PB N="44" REF="016311_0047_0F9C2B316FAFA058">
long mu&s;t the coloni&s;ts wage war with their brethern, and embrue their hands in kindred blood, even al|though the utter de&s;truction of both &s;hould be the inevitable con&s;equence! It will not therefore be ex|aggerating or going beyond the truth, when I confi|dently pronounce, that the Congre&s;s, &s;o far as in them lay, have betrayed the&s;e colonies, with their deare&s;t intere&s;ts, to France, and delivered them up to her va&s;&s;alage.</P>
<P>Were you to reply with your u&s;ual chicance and &s;ophi&s;try&mdash;
<Q>That France is equally bound with the colonies; and that allies u&s;ually engage not to de|&s;ert each other</Q>
&mdash;it could only impo&s;e on &s;uch as are ignorant or weak. Your ca&s;e is totally different from that of France. France is not in a &s;tate of re|volt; &s;he is not dependent on any other power; &s;he has in her&s;elf great re&s;ources of men and money; her government is de&s;potic, and none of her &s;ubjects are di&s;affected.</P>
<P>The rever&s;e of this in every particular is your ca&s;e, &s;ave only in the article of de&s;poti&s;m, which is a &s;ure indication of weakne&s;s in you, however it may enable France to exert her &s;trength. You are in a &s;tate of revolt again&s;t your rightful &s;overeign; and whatever tone or air of confidence you may a&s;&s;ume, a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of this preys on your heart, and depre&s;&s;es your &s;pirits; your inglorious alliance with France, by which you lie at the mercy of that perfidious pow|er, is a demon&s;tration of your dependence on her for &s;upplies; the wretched &s;tate of your paper currency clearly &s;hews how your re&s;ources &s;tand in the article of money; and as for men, you cannot rai&s;e an army without <HI>compelling</HI> tho&s;e to take arms who &s;hould cultivate the earth; and this in a little time mu&s;t pro|duce a famine, as it nece&s;&s;arily would in any other
<PB N="45" REF="016311_0048_0F9C2B31F8EC1520">
country, which was circum&s;tanced like America; the coloni&s;ts are divided as to the object you have in view; and a majority of them, beyond all doubt, pre|fer a con&s;titutional union with Britain, to a nomi|nal independency, and pernicious alliance with France.</P>
<P>I dare appeal even to your&s;elf for the truth of the&s;e &s;everal facts; and any per&s;on of plain under&s;tanding may readily &s;ee the con&s;equences. Your weakne&s;s compelled you to fly for &s;uccour to France; and the longer the war continues, you mu&s;t grow proportion|ably weaker, and more dependent on her; and this dependence will give her an intire a&s;cendency and power over you.</P>
<P>Nay, more. You have contracted a large debt to France. Your <HI>re&s;olve</HI> undeniably proves what was well known before&mdash;that you have MORTGAGED this counntry for that debt&mdash;a mortgage which France will take care to continue; for as that debt will unavoidably increa&s;e whil&s;t this conte&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, (your trade being already ruined) the French King mu&s;t in the end, according to your ble&s;&s;ed &s;chemes, be Lord Paramount and Proprietor of North-Ameri|ca. So that every American who is fighting again&s;t Britain, may have the plea&s;ure to reflect, that altho' he is riveting the &s;hackles, and labouring for the ut|ter ruin, of this country, yet he is extending the em|pire and glory of the <HI>grand Monarque.</HI></P>
<P>Go then, Sir, and tell your deluded partizans that <HI>France is equally bound with you, and you &s;hould not de|&s;ert your ally.</HI> Such an alliance, in your circum&s;tances, is nothing but &s;ervitude, and mu&s;t end in the de&s;truc|tion of America; and tho&s;e who will be duped by &s;uch &s;ophi&s;try&mdash;who wilfully &s;hut their eyes at the
<PB N="46" REF="016311_0049_0F9C2B32B9B6B438">
di&s;grace and impending ruin of their country, and will not exert them&s;elves to avert them, de&s;erve no better fate than to become va&s;&s;als of France, and wear wooden &s;hoes. I will venture to affirm that France has too much policy to de&s;ire more of you, for the pre&s;ent, than &s;he has gained already, in point of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. She would check any further advances on your part, as &s;ubver&s;ive of her de&s;igns; ju&s;t as the Pope di&s;approved of the precipitate mea&s;ures of JAMES II, which, in fact, defeated the purpo&s;es of both.</P>
<P>This is not the language of prejudice, but of truth; nor is there a propo&s;ition in Euclid more evident or demon&s;trable than that America mu&s;t be en&s;laved and ruined, on the plan you have laid. My con&s;olation is, that Britain, which fir&s;t &s;ettled, indulgently fo&s;|tered, and fully protected this country, is &s;till able, with the ble&s;&s;ing of providence, to wre&s;t it from the u&s;upation of its dome&s;tic, and perfidious intru&s;ion of its foreign, enemies.</P>
<P>Britain has frequently humbled the pride, checked the ambition, and &s;ubdued the power of France; &s;he never was in a better condition to do &s;o than at this in&s;tant. Notwith&s;tanding your fond dreams, and fal&s;e in&s;inuations that &s;he was exhau&s;ted and help|le&s;s, &s;ad experience will &s;oon bring you conviction of the contrary. Never at any period was her com|merce more flouri&s;hing, her wealth greater, her fleets &s;o formidable, or her armies more gallant or nume|rous. Your deceit and &s;pecious pretences indeed di|vided her councils for a time; and this, with the mild &s;pirit of her government, has protracted your u&s;urpation beyond all rational expectation.

<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN and COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE anxiety I feel for your welfare, and my apprehen&s;ions of the ruin which is now hang|ing over you, induce me to addre&s;s you, notwith|&s;tanding the difficulties and di&s;couragements that lie in the way to prevent it.</P>
<P>Your pre&s;ent rulers are labouring to keep you in the dark. They not only conceal from you the mo&s;t important tran&s;actions relative to America, in which they are concerned them&s;elves; but they do all in their power to hinder you from receiving informati|on from any other quarter, either re&s;pecting your own &s;ituation or the true &s;tate of things in Europe. If a per&s;on goes out of the Briti&s;h lines, a guard is &s;et over him and you are not permitted to conver&s;e with him. If a new&s;-paper or pamphlet from hence, hap|pens to find its way among you, you are obliged to read it privately and then hide it. Every man has a tyrant at his door, watching over him with the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious jealou&s;y. You are denied even the freedom of &s;peech, and cannot communicate your &s;entiments with &s;afety; much le&s;s are you &s;uffered to act as your judgment and inclinations would lead you. The In|qui&s;itors
<PB N="49" REF="016311_0052_0F9C2B373732F370">
of Spain, Portugal and Rome are not more diligent to keep their deluded va&s;&s;als in profound ig|norance; or to prevent Go&s;pel truth from reaching them, which would di&s;pel the thick cloud of &s;uper|&s;tition and error that covers them; than your Com|mittee and Congre&s;s men, your rulers in general are, to keep you in ignorance of your real &s;tate, and pre|vent your eyes from being opened to &s;ee your pre&s;ent danger.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this; I mu&s;t tell you that &s;ome of your|&s;elves are willing to be impo&s;ed on, and to believe the &s;pecious lies that are invented to deceive you. You will account him your enemy that would tell you the truth; you will pronounce him <HI>a wicked Tory,</HI> and that he <HI>is inimical to his country!</HI> But is this right, my brethren? Should you not li&s;ten to truth? Do you not &s;in again&s;t the God of truth and your own &s;ouls; when you wilfully turn a deaf ear to it? Is it not right that you &s;hould know the true &s;tate of your affairs&mdash;what you have to depend on&mdash;and what will be the real con&s;equences of the mea&s;ures that are now pur&s;uing?</P>
<P>All men have their prejudices; and whoever is &s;en&s;ible of his own, will be ready to make due al|lowance for tho&s;e of others. Notwith&s;tanding the prejudices which have influenced you, yet I know you &s;o well, that I can &s;afely rely on your candour and good &s;en&s;e for an an&s;wer to the above que&s;tions. I am &s;ure the language of your hearts, is, that you <HI>&s;hould</HI> know tho&s;e particulars&mdash;that you <HI>&s;hould</HI> li&s;ten to truth.</P>
<P>You heartily lament with me the error, bondage and &s;lavery which have, and do now over&s;pread &s;o great a part of the earth. However tyrants may have
<PB N="50" REF="016311_0053_0F9C2B3896863858">
been blamed for this, yet I may affirm, that all the tyrants in the univer&s;e could not accompli&s;h it, had not the people them&s;elves been devoted to them; had they not been aver&s;e to the means of information, attentive to plau&s;ible delu&s;ions, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the yoke of &s;lavery. To the&s;e cau&s;es we &s;hould princi|pally refer the Heathen, Mahometan and Popi&s;h Su|per&s;tition which hath formerly, and does now pre|vail in the world; as well as the de&s;poti&s;m under which &s;o many of our fellow creatures have groaned. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible for you, my countrymen, to avoid the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m now, and probably the &s;hackles of Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, and counting beads, unle&s;s you open your eyes, think and act for your&s;elves as becomes free-men.</P>
<P>I do not de&s;ire you to take my word, or believe my a&s;&s;ertions on the&s;e points, further than they are &s;up|ported by plain facts and clear rea&s;oning. But th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> I expect that you will a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch facts and rea|&s;oning when laid before you; that you will act as unbia&s;&s;ed rea&s;on and your intere&s;t direct in con&s;e|quence of them; that you will not be the dupes of prejudice, the tools of crafty, de&s;igning men, who have already deceived you often; and who&s;e intere&s;t and con&s;equence entirely depend on your being &s;till under a deception.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be any &s;atisfaction to you, I can de|clare with the &s;incerity of a martyr, that my aim in addre&s;&s;ing you now, is to promote your welfare by warning you of your danger, and the ruin that is ha&s;tening towards you. I have no intere&s;ts that cla&s;s with, or that are &s;eparate from, yours. Hav|ing from my infancy imbibed generous principles of freedom, I cordially dete&s;t tyranny in every &s;hape, and from whatever quarter it may come. In my
<PB N="51" REF="016311_0054_0F9C2B3994F05A00">
choice, I would fly to the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth to find a &s;pot where I could enjoy rational li|berty, which I e&s;teem the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing; rather than &s;ubmit to the tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of any man, or body of men.</P>
<P>Yet righteous as my intentions are, and undeni|ably aiming at your benefit, I would not venture to addre&s;s you now, were I not certain that your own feelings will, in &s;ome degree, convince you of your dangerous &s;ituation, and powerfully &s;econd what I have to &s;ay. Tyranny may &s;tiffle the voice of com|plaint, or &s;hackle the body&mdash;Deception may, for a while, by its bewitching influence, lead us in the path of error and de&s;truction; but neither of them can &s;uppre&s;s our feelings under injuries and oppre&s;&s;i|on. To your feelings therefore, to your rea&s;on, and to that knowledge you have acquired, even excluded as you are from the proper means of informations be the appeal for what I &s;hall offer.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, that <HI>you have been often deceived</HI>; and pray reflect, is not this the ca&s;e? Recollect the fir&s;t ri&s;e of this unhappy conte&s;t with the parent &s;tate, when you were actually the mo&s;t free and happy people upon earth. Your Congre&s;s then &s;olemnly appealed to heaven and to you, that they were loyal and affecti|onate &s;ubjects of GEORGE III.&mdash;that they di&s;claimed every idea of independency&mdash;that none but enemies could &s;ugge&s;t they aimed at it&mdash;that their intere&s;t and happine&s;s depended on a con&s;titutional union with Great-Britain&mdash;and that their &s;ole object was to obtain a redre&s;s of tho&s;e greviances which they either apprehended, or pretended to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>In the &s;implicity of your hearts, you believed tho&s;e declarations. But were you not deceived? Are you
<PB N="52" REF="016311_0055_0F9C2B3A4D2C0E18">
not convinced that your leaders impo&s;ed on you? That revolt and rebellion were in their hearts, whil&s;t their declarations were filled with profe&s;&s;ions of loy|alty to the king, and attachment to the parent &s;tate? With &s;uch artifice and &s;ubtility did they conduct matters, that it was next to impo&s;&s;ible for the bulk of the people to penetrate into their real de&s;igns. To hint that the Congre&s;s had any thoughts of indepen|dency, would endanger a man's life. In the &s;pring of 1776, a gentleman came from Philadelphia to this city, and reported that the Congre&s;s were delibera|ting on that point. The committee of &s;afety took fire at the <HI>calumny,</HI> ordered a &s;earch to be made for the gentleman, who, to &s;ave him&s;elf from the fury of the mob, was obliged to take &s;anctuary on board of one of the King's &s;hips: yet the declaration of inde|pendency was publi&s;hed the July following! But to proceed:</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s declared that a redre&s;s of grievances was the only object they had in view; and when that was obtained, all di&s;cord would cea&s;e. You believed this al&s;o; yet when that redre&s;s was offered by the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners&mdash;when terms more liberal than the mo&s;t &s;anguine republican could have hoped for, were held out, they were rejected by Congre&s;s with the utmo&s;t contempt and di&s;dain. The truth is, they had &s;o entangled them&s;elves with France, had MORTGA|GED the&s;e Colonies &s;o deeply to that in&s;idious power, and the members of the Congre&s;s carried on &s;o gain|ful a traffic, that they did not <HI>chu&s;e,</HI> and <HI>would not</HI> break off the connection.</P>
<P>By the loud declamations of your Congre&s;s-Patri|ots again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion and taxes, you were taught to believe that they were the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted of men, and aimed only at the public good; that all oppre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="53" REF="016311_0056_0F9C2B3B08C70E18">
and taxes would &s;oon be at an end, and a free trade carried on with the whole world. All this you &s;wal|lowed, and believed it to be as true as the go&s;pel. Yet the&s;e di&s;intere&s;ted patriots are now trading on <HI>your</HI> credit, and rai&s;ing immen&s;e fortunes at <HI>your</HI> expence. I appeal to the publications of Me&s;&s;rs <HI>Deane, Paine, Morris,</HI> and others in Philadelphia, for the truth of this; and were that whole ma&s;s of corruption fully uncovered, it would a&s;toni&s;h the world. You find tho&s;e pretended enemies of oppre&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t unre|lenting oppre&s;&s;ors, and their little finger heavier than the King's Loins. In&s;tead of an exemption from taxes, you are fleeced more than any other people this day on the face of the earth. In &s;ome provinces, a per&s;on who formerly&mdash;in the <HI>woeful</HI> days of <HI>Royal Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI>&mdash;paid annually 10l. in taxes, now in the time of Congre&s;&s;ional <HI>liberty and exemption from taxes,</HI> pays annually 1200l. in taxes, and &s;o on in propor|tion! Nor is there any pro&s;pect of this ending. Were every improved farm, and all the vacant lands in the <HI>thirteen united &s;tates,</HI> &s;et up at public auction, were they &s;old at the price which lands &s;old at in the year 1772, yet the &s;um total would not amount to the quantity of paper dollars, and other bills of credit which are now circulating among you: And this quantity of paper money, joined to the millions due to France, and the nece&s;&s;ary expence of your govern|ments, mu&s;t entail an in&s;upportable load of taxes on America, for ages to come, and overwhelm it with ruin! It is needle&s;s to tell you that you have not a free trade. Scarcely can any of your &s;kulking &s;loops peep out of an inlet, or a French interloper appear on our coa&s;ts, but they are in&s;tantly &s;eized by a Briti&s;h cruizer, or a <HI>Tory</HI> privateer.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be replied,
<Q>that the above advanta|ges could only be expected when independency was
<PB N="54" REF="016311_0057_0F9C2B3BB824D938">
e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the war at an end:</Q>
I an&s;wer&mdash; that if independency was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the war ended to-morrow, yet the debt due to France mu&s;t be paid, unle&s;s the Congre&s;s mean to defraud the French, as they defrauded the Briti&s;h merchants to whom the Americans owed large &s;ums when the rebellion began. I an&s;wer again, that the above ma&s;s of paper money and bills, is now in actual circulation, and mu&s;t either be &s;unk by taxes, or &s;ink of it&s;elf; be&s;ides the expence of &s;upporting the new governments, which could not be le&s;s than <HI>three millions &s;terling</HI> annu|ally and mu&s;t be rai&s;ed by taxes; for the Congre&s;s have acted ju&s;t like a &s;pendthrift heir who came too early to his e&s;tate, and madly involved him&s;elf in &s;uch a debt, that the income of his e&s;tate cannot pay the intere&s;t, nor its intrin&s;ic value di&s;charge the principal. I an&s;wer further&mdash;that independency is now a mere dream, a phantom. The Congre&s;s have &s;o entwined them&s;elves with France, that were even the Briti&s;h power &s;et a&s;ide, they could not break loo&s;e from the former. If not dependent on Britain, the Colonies mu&s;t be dependant on France; and were the Congre&s;s now to declare LOUIS XVI, &s;overeign and liege Lord of North-America, it would not &s;hock or &s;urprize me &s;o much as their <HI>Re&s;olve</HI> of Jan. 14, 1779.&mdash;
<Q>That as the&s;e united &s;tates may not of right, &s;o they will not conclude either truce or peace with the common enemy, without the formal con&s;ent of their ally fir&s;t obtained.</Q></P>
<P>I appeal to any man of plain under&s;tanding, whe|ther a declaration of the Congre&s;s that the <HI>French King</HI> was <HI>King of North-America,</HI> would he near &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with this Re&s;olve, or &s;o great a &s;tride from it, as this <HI>Re&s;olve</HI> is incon&s;i&s;tent with, and di&s;tant from, the repeated declarations of the Congre&s;s, long after this conte&s;t began. The powers of Britain and
<PB N="55" REF="016311_0058_0F9C2B3C8036A060">
France now &s;tand in the way of your independency; if the Congre&s;s can remove tho&s;e powers, they may accompli&s;h the point; but I apprehend they will meet with equal difficulty in doing this, as the man did in finding a place to fix his machines on to heave the earth from its place. But I return to the point from which I digre&s;&s;ed to an&s;wer this objection.</P>
<P>To induce you to take up arms, and join in rebel|lion again&s;t your King, you were told at fir&s;t that the rebellion would &s;oon be over. Some of you rea|dily believed this&mdash;you thought it would only be a &s;hort <HI>frolick</HI>&mdash;that it was very clever to wear a cock|ade and regimentals&mdash;<HI>when you could get them,</HI> and &s;trut after a drum and fife. But here al&s;o you were deceived. After all your &s;truggles, and the lo&s;s of at lea&s;t 60,000 lives on your &s;ide, by the &s;word, or &s;ickne&s;s, the conte&s;t is not yet ended.</P>
<P>You were made to believe at the beginning of each campaign, that it would be the la&s;t. You were told that New-York would certainly be evacuated la&s;t fall&mdash;la&s;t Chri&s;tmas&mdash;or this &s;pring at the very fur|the&s;t; yet you may be a&s;&s;ured there is no more in|tention of evacuating New-York, than there is to evacuate London.</P>
<P>You have been a&s;&s;ured a thou&s;and times that Britain was helple&s;s and exhau&s;ted&mdash;de&s;titute of men and money&mdash;unable to carry on the war longer, and mu&s;t give up the conte&s;t. But you have been as egregiou&s;ly deceived in this as any of the former par|ticulars, and perhaps it is the mo&s;t fatal deception of any. Britain cannot now give up the conte&s;t&mdash;the Congre&s;s have put it out of her power. She mu&s;t exert her&s;elf to prevent the colonies from becoming an acce&s;&s;ion to the power of France, were there no
<PB N="56" REF="016311_0059_0F9C2B3D46EC9D10">
other rea&s;on. She never abounded more in re&s;ources for carrying on a war than at this in&s;tant&mdash;in wealth, commerce and credit. No le&s;s than 77,000 &s;eamen were in the King's &s;ervice la&s;t November; that num|ber has been much increa&s;ed &s;ince, and her land forces are in proportion. As &s;he is thus able, &s;o al&s;o is &s;he fully <HI>determined</HI> to pro&s;ecute this war with vigour. When rou&s;ed by injuries or in&s;ults, &s;he hath frequently made her enemies tremble in every quarter of the Globe; nor have I the lea&s;t doubt but &s;he will, with the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, make her do|me&s;tic and foreign enemies &s;orely rue their ungrateful, perfidious conduct in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate every in&s;tance in which you have been thus deceived. Whenever any advance was to be made towards Rebellion&mdash; when any arbitrary, oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ure, which might rai&s;e an alarm, was to be carried&mdash;when an army was to be rai&s;ed, or any other &s;tep taken to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of the Congre&s;s, a mon&s;trous lie was invented and circulated, and you generally were the dupes of tho&s;e artifices, and &s;wallowed the bait. Thus have you been gradually led on to your pre&s;ent deplorable &s;ituation, and brought to the very brink of ruin.</P>
<P>This, as far it goes, is a faithful and ju&s;t repre|&s;entation of your &s;tate; for much remains yet to be mentioned. Were I even your enemy, I could not forbear commi&s;erating it; but as your friend I &s;in|cerely lament it. O what a ma&s;s of happine&s;s&mdash; what ble&s;&s;ings and privileges have you wantonly and fooli&s;hly flung away! How grating mu&s;t your reflecti|ons be, whil&s;t comparing your pre&s;ent with your form|er &s;tate. <HI>E&s;an</HI> &s;old his birth right for a me&s;s of pot|tage; but you have &s;old the birth right of Briti&s;h
<PB N="57" REF="016311_0060_0F9C2B3DF514F958">
&s;ubjects&mdash;You have exchanged freedom, &s;ecurity and wealth, for oppre&s;&s;ion, mi&s;rule and beggary, and for va&s;&s;alage to France! Your farms, your e&s;tates and property are actually MORTGAGED to France. You plow and &s;ow, you labour and toil, you fight and bleed for France, and for tho&s;e who have betrayed you to France&mdash;Your Congre&s;s! Your grain, your tobacco, your produce of every kind, your cattle and lumber, mu&s;t go for vile paper dol|lars, which are no better than &s;o many old rags! How long are you to remain in this di&s;graceful, wretched &s;ituation? Where, my Countrymen, where is that good &s;en&s;e, that innate love of freedom for which you were once famed? Are they totally ex|tingui&s;hed? Can you indeed &s;ubmit to be the tools of French Papi&s;ts&mdash;to be doomed to poverty and ruin by a Congre&s;s, which is a creature of your own making, whil&s;t its members are FATTENING ON YOUR SPOILS?</P>
<P>But me thinks I &s;ee a flaming <HI>patriot,</HI> who &s;hares in tho&s;e &s;poils, or derives all his con&s;equence from your mi&s;fortunes&mdash;methinks I &s;ee him knit his brow, and foaming with rage at what I &s;ay, declare to you mo&s;t po&s;itively, <HI>that I am a cur&s;ed Tory&mdash;that all I tell you is a parcel of lies&mdash;that I only mean to &s;ow di&s;&s;ention among the Americans, and thereby &s;erve the cau&s;e of Britain, which has now no other hope of &s;ucce&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t like this <HI>patriot,</HI> with &s;imilar de&s;igns, and equally contrary to truth, did the fir&s;t promoter of rebellion declare po&s;itively to <HI>Eve,</HI>

<P>Believe me, my Countrymen, that Britain &s;tands not in need of my feeble aid; and as for di&s;&s;entions, they already abound among you, God wot, as much as the mo&s;t determined enemy of the Congre&s;s could wi&s;h.

<HEAD>LETTER VI. To JOHN JAY, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON carefully reviewing the conduct of your Congre&s;s, I find a remarkable conformity be|tween it and the rules laid down by Machiavel in his well known treati&s;e, intitled, THE PRINCE. As it may contribute to place the character of the Con|gre&s;s in a true light, I &s;hall in this letter point out &s;ome of the in&s;tances in which that conformity is &s;o evident, that it mu&s;t &s;trike the dulle&s;t ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>However the world may be divided as to the <HI>mo|tives</HI> which induced Machiavel to write that Trea|ti&s;e, yet all agree that it contains the mo&s;t execrable doctrines.

<P>It will be proper to give &s;ome particulars of the man's character who is &s;o earne&s;tly recommended as a pattern to others. Cae&s;ar Borgia was the natural &s;on of Pope Alexander VI; and a more ambitious, per&s;idious or cruel mon&s;ter perhaps never di&s;graced humanity. Ambition was the reigning pa&s;&s;ion of his mind; to gratify it, he &s;tuck at nothing, how|ever infamous. Borgia a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated his own brother, and ordered his dead body to be thrown into the Tyber. He cau&s;ed the Pope's Swi&s;s guards to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated to revenge him&s;elf on that nation for a pretended affront. He deprived hundreds of their property by violence to &s;atiate his avarice; he de|po&s;ed the Duke of Urbino, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his territories; he murdered &s;everal Lords of the Ur&s;ini family becau&s;e they were ob&s;tacles to his greatne&s;s, after he had decoved them to an interview by the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of freind&s;hip; he cau&s;ed a Venetian Lady of quality, whom he had ravi&s;hed, to be flung into the Tyber and drowned. In &s;hort, to u&s;e the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's &s;trong language,
<Q>He was the mo&s;t abominable mon&s;ter that Hell ever vomited out upon the earth.</Q>

This was the &s;tate of things in the province of New-York; the ca&s;e was &s;imilar in other provinces. When the Congre&s;s had in &s;ome degree e&s;tabli&s;h|ed their power, and new modelled the government of each province, the more expeditious mode of trial by laws of their own framing, confi&s;cation, hanging, &amp;c. took place.</NOTE> flinging them into loath&s;ome jails, con|fi&s;cating their e&s;tates, &s;hooting them in &s;wamps and woods as &s;u&s;pected tories, hanging them after a mock trial; and all this becau&s;e they would not ab|jure their rightful Sovereign, and bear arms again&s;t him.

<P>What I a&s;&s;ert is this&mdash;that there is a remarkable conformity between the conduct of the Congre&s;s and
<PB N="63" REF="016311_0066_0F9C2B46386082A8">
the rules laid down in Machiavel's PRINCE. Whether that conformity proceeded from accident or de&s;ign, is foreign to the que&s;tion, and of very little moment. Now let facts decide whether this a&s;&s;ertion be true or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>By <HI>Prince,</HI> Machiavel in his treati&s;e means an u&s;urper&mdash;a character which applies exactly to you: The power that is acquired by the in&s;trumentality of mobs, by deceit, violence and the pro&s;tration of law and order, mu&s;t be u&s;urped, Agreeably to this character, and the &s;pirit of his treati&s;e, Machiavel teaches his u&s;urper to &s;purn every obligation, and throw a&s;ide all regard to the rights, liberties and lives of others, whenever it would facilitate his way to power <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince, Pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>How well your Congre&s;s have practi&s;ed tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons, millions can te&s;tify. You broke through and &s;purned the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations that &s;ubjects can be under to a Sovereign&mdash;or fellow-&s;ubjects to fellow-&s;ubjects. You violated your own oaths, and compelled others to violate theirs. Altho' &s;en&s;ible that carnage, de&s;olation and ruin, mu&s;t be the in|evitable con&s;equences of your proceedings, yet &s;till you per&s;i&s;ted in brandi&s;hing the &s;word of rebellion. When a redre&s;s of every grievance, real or pretended, was generou&s;ly offered on the part of Britain&mdash; when every thing, except ab&s;olute independence, was allowed&mdash;when even the &s;ub&s;tance of that was grant|ed, and nothing but the bare name was witheld: Yet your Congre&s;s turned a deaf ear to all tho&s;e pro|po&s;als, and contemptuou&s;ly rejected the offers of peace. Nay, to rebellion you added the mo&s;t out|rageous in&s;ults; thereby provoking Britain to inflict &s;evere puni&s;hments on her rebellious children whom &s;he would willingly have &s;pared.

<P>Machiavel &s;ays&mdash;
<Q>Experience &s;hews that tho&s;e Princes of our own times, who have made lea&s;t account of their word and honour, have done the greate&s;t things; by the dint of craft and circum|vention they have for the mo&s;t part got the better of others who proceeded with &s;incerity and regard to their engagements&mdash;A wi&s;e Prince therefore ought not to regard his word, when keeping it will be to his prejudice.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince, Chap. <HI>18</HI></NOTE>&mdash;</P>
<P>This <HI>precious</HI> doctrine hath been uniformly practi|&s;ed by your congre&s;s. Your duplicity is become pro|verbial. The Treaty at the <HI>Cedars,</HI> and Convention of <HI>Saratoga</HI> furni&s;h us with illu&s;trious &s;pecimens of your regard to public faith and honour; ju&s;t as the impri&s;onment of Lieut. <HI>Hele,</HI> manife&s;ts your venera|tion for the law of nations; to pa&s;s by other in&s;tan|ces. &mdash;But to proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>"A Prince," continues Machiavel,
<Q>will never want colourable pretences to varni&s;h the breach of his faith&mdash;however it is highly nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;gu&s;e this craft, and to be a thorough ma&s;ter of &s;imula|tion and di&s;&s;imulation. For &s;ome men are &s;o &s;imple, and others &s;o eager to get out of pre&s;ent difficulties, that whoever knows how to act his part well, will always find dupes to his hypocri&s;y.</Q>
As a recent example, Machiavel mentions Pope Alexander VI, &mdash;
<Q>who&s;e life was one continued impo&s;ition on mankind: He neither did nor thought any thing
<PB N="65" REF="016311_0068_0F9C2B47B567EBB8">
but how to deceive others: No man ever made &s;tronger prote&s;tations of &s;incerity, or took more &s;olemn oaths to confirm them; no man ever &s;hewed le&s;s regard to tho&s;e engagements: Yet Alexander was &s;o well acquainted with the would, that he always found fre&s;h people to work upon.</Q>
&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prince, Chap. <HI>18.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>That the Congre&s;s have found pretences for their rebellion, and that they al&s;o found dupes to tho&s;e pretences, is certain. They wrote addre&s;&s;es to the King, the Parliament, the inhabitants of Great-Britain, Ireland and the Colonies. In the&s;e they made the mo&s;t &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty to their Sovereign, though they undoubtedly meant to re|nounce and abjure him&mdash;of attachment and love to their European brethren, though they intended to &s;eperate from them; and were even then taking mea&s;ures to defraud and ruin them. They com|plained bitterly of grievances in this country, which were not felt&mdash;of taxes, which were not levied&mdash;of &s;avages employed to &s;calp them, although the &s;avages were actually kept back by Government from the work of death&mdash;of tyrannical oppre&s;&s;ion and lo&s;s of freedom, when we were running wild with licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s. The&s;e pretences, however fal&s;e, were &s;o colourable, &s;o artfully managed, that they varni&s;hed over the real de&s;igns and perfidy of the Congre&s;s. Republicans indeed, from principle, crowded to your &s;tandard here -they commenced your zealous ad|vocates in Europe. But be&s;ides the&s;e, you gained, for a time, many to your cau&s;e, who had been among your warme&s;t oppo&s;ers, had they known your inten|tions. The&s;e were dupes of your hypocri&s;y; but the charm has been long &s;ince di&s;&s;olved. The di&s;cern|ing, the loyal and hone&s;t &s;oon &s;aw through the flim&s;y di&s;gui&s;e, and in&s;tantly abandoned men who had
<PB N="66" REF="016311_0069_0F9C2B4C50954128">
abandoned truth and &s;incerity. By throwing your|&s;elves into the arms of France at la&s;t, and delivering this country, as far as you were capable, to the va&s;|&s;alage of that in&s;idious power, you have fully mani|fe&s;ted to the world your di&s;regard of the liberties, welfare and happine&s;s of America.</P>
<P>Machiavel, after &s;aying that a u&s;urper
<Q>&s;hould have the appearance of good qualities, but to put them in practice would be to his prejudice,</Q>
in|&s;tructs his u&s;urper how to fortify him&s;elf with proper caution.&mdash;"He mu&s;t be con&s;tantly on his guard," &s;ays Machiavel,
<Q>that nothing may ever drop from his mouth but what &s;eems to flow from a heart full of goodne&s;s, mercy, truth, humanity and religion; but particularly of the la&s;t; for mankind in gene|ral form their judgment rather from appearances than realities: All men have eyes, but not many have the gift of penetration.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prince, Chap. <HI>18.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of the utility of this rule, you availed your&s;elves of it. You profe&s;&s;edly undertook to vin|dicate the liberties of America, and re&s;cue the colo|nies from taxation and tyranny. You proclaimed fa&s;ts, and appointed days of public humiliation. The&s;e were popular things; and who <HI>could</HI> think otherwi&s;e than that they proceeded from hearts over|flowing with goodne&s;s, humanity and religion? All indeed had eyes to &s;ee the&s;e matters; and although many formed their judgment from appearances; yet &s;ome had the gift of penetration, and con&s;idered all this as a &s;olemn mockery of God and man.</P>
<P>They thought it highly farcical that men&mdash;many of whom believed as much of the Alcoran or Talmud as of the Bible&mdash;&s;hould be the authors of religious
<PB N="67" REF="016311_0070_0F9C2B4D39E745D0">
in&s;titutions on the principles of Chri&s;tianity. They judged it a mockery of the Supreme Being to de&s;ire his interpo&s;ition in behalf of mea&s;ures which were expre&s;sly forbidden in his word, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of his religion; or to boa&s;t of his pa|tronage, as was your ca&s;e on any little &s;ucce&s;s you met with, when the di&s;ciples of Mahomet, or of any other impo&s;ter, equally &s;ucce&s;sful, might, according to this rule, lay a much better claim to the patronage of Heaven.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o a mockery of men. The &s;ecurity of their rights and liberties was the o&s;ten&s;ible object held up; yet mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued which mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;ubvert both, as hath actually happened. Liberty is fled from that part of America which owns your &s;way. There is more liberty in Turkey than in the dominions of the Congre&s;s. Can liberty exi&s;t where every man who differs in &s;entiment from you, is not only precluded from the common rights of citizens, but is al&s;o liable to impri&s;onment, confi&s;cation and death? And as for taxes, the &s;ub|jects of your <HI>great and good Ally</HI> are not near &s;o hea|vily burthened in this way, as the Americans. That u&s;urpers &s;hould gain power by deceit and vio|lence, is no new thing&mdash;it has frequently happened: But that people, in que&s;t of liberty, &s;hould tamely &s;ubmit to &s;uch a yoke as this; or that in &s;uch circum|&s;tances, they can be per&s;uaded their rights and liber|ties are pre&s;erved and &s;ecure, is equally a&s;toni&s;hing and new in the hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e a war &s;hould be protracted, and the u&s;ur|per's &s;ubject grew tired of it, Machiavel tells him how to act,
<Q>A prudent Prince, &s;ays he, &s;ometimes artfully buoys up his &s;ubjects with hopes that their &s;ufferings will &s;oon be over; &s;ometimes he &s;trikes
<PB N="68" REF="016311_0071_0F9C2B4DB5627D18">
a terror into them by magnifying the cruelty and blood-thir&s;tine&s;s of the enemy; and he will take other proper methods to fix the wavering, and quiet &s;uch as are mo&s;t clamorous <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prince, Chap. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>To this rule you have been peculiarly attentive, and it has done you e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice; without it, the rebellion had been long &s;ince ended. At the beginning of every campaign, you gave out that it would be the la&s;t&mdash;that all fighting, and the &s;ufferings of Ame|rica, would &s;oon be over. How often has the time been fixed when you were to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New-York? I que&s;tion whether there has been a month for more than two years pa&s;t, that was not mention|ed by you or your partizans, for the accompli&s;hment of that joyful event. The &s;imple multitude always &s;wallowed the bait, and their &s;pirits were elated. Now that every hope of this &s;ort is vani&s;hed, other fictions are propagated. I am told the prevailing de|lu&s;ion at pre&s;ent, and what your partizans &s;edulou&s;ly promote, is&mdash;that Great Britain has offered indepen|dency to your Congre&s;s; and nothing but the ad|ju&s;tment of &s;ome articles relative to Canada, the Fi&s;heries, &amp;c. is wanting to &s;ettle the accommodation. Incredible as it may appear, yet I am a&s;&s;ured that even this ab&s;urd fal&s;hood is &s;wallowed with avidity! Such men would believe tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, or deny that &s;un&s;hine afforded light, if either of them happened to gratify their prejudices, or &s;erve their intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>You made Europe and America ring with mourn|ful accounts of Briti&s;h cruelties; and yet in truth mo&s;t of them were purely fictitious; others were exaggerated; and the re&s;t were &s;uch as you your&s;elves made nece&s;&s;ary, or that are unavoidable in time of war. You publickly invited the Americans to tran&s;|mit to you whatever reports they could glean up of
<PB N="69" REF="016311_0072_0F9C2B4E810CE3F0">
the <HI>enemy's cruelties</HI>; and you appointed <HI>a Committee of Grievances</HI> to arrange and record the virulent tales that were &s;ent in by every &s;editious, republican zealot, however groundle&s;s. The&s;e, and other like methods you practi&s;ed in the true &s;pirit of Machiaveli&s;m.</P>
<P>It is by no means my intention to point out in every in&s;tance the conformity of your conduct with Machi|avel's rules: To do this, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to write a hi&s;tory of the Congre&s;s, and tran&s;cribe his treati&s;e. The &s;pecimens I have given are quite &s;uf|ficient. I acknowledge however that in &s;ome Things you have departed, and do &s;till depart, from his rules; but you are excu&s;able perhaps in this, &s;ince tho&s;e rules are incon&s;i&s;tent with the general tenor of his treati&s;e, and contrary to his other po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Thus he a&s;&s;erts&mdash;
<Q>that Princes, i. e. u&s;urpers, &s;hould take care not to make them&s;elves hated or de&s;pi&s;ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> 19.</NOTE>;</Q>

<P>That Congre&s;s have not ob&s;erved the caution here recommended on tho&s;e two points, is evident from the number of confi&s;cations and executions which we are daily adverti&s;ed of in your own news-papers <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In a late Bo&s;ton paper, the &s;entence of perpetual bani&s;h|ment was denounced on about 300 per&s;ons, among whom were many of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay.

<P>It is much to be lamented that tho&s;e execrable methods have too often proved &s;ucce&s;sful; and that mi&s;ery and ruin have been thereby entailed on milli|ons.

<P>Yet it &s;hould not be forgotten that many more have failed, than have &s;ucceeded, in their attempts at u&s;urped power. Even Cae&s;ar Borgia, the mo&s;t artful and per&s;idious of men, and the pattern held up by Machiavel, was utterly ruined at la&s;t.

<P><PB N="72" REF="016311_0075_0F9C2B53531479C8">Cae&s;ar Borgia, like your Congre&s;s, entered into an alliance with the French King, LEWIS XII, to conquer the Milane&s;e. Soon after, LEWIS made him Duke of Valentinois, and allowed him a pen&s;ion. Their joint efforts to &s;ubjugate the innocent Milane&s;e, &s;ucceeded for a time; but were finally defeated. Borgia, about this time, concerted a &s;cheme with his father, Pope Alexander VI. to poi&s;on nine newly created Cardinals that he might po&s;&s;e&s;s their effects; but the wine, which was prepared for the purpo&s;e, was, by mi&s;take, brought to, and drank by them|&s;elves. A vigorous con&s;titution, and the u&s;e of antidotes, re&s;tored Borgia; but Alexander died; and with him ended all Borgia's pro&s;perity. Stripped immediately of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and wealth, the fruits of his former crimes, he was bani&s;hed into Spain, and there impri&s;oned. After two years confinement, he made e&s;cape out of a window, and fled to Navarre; from whence he wrote to LEWIS, his <HI>great and good Ally,</HI> reque&s;ting a&s;&s;i&s;tance to re&s;tore his Shattered fortunes. LEWIS, judging it would not be for his intere&s;t at that time to &s;hew Borgia any countenance, not only refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but al&s;o confi&s;cated his Duke|dom, and withdrew his pen&s;ion. De&s;pi&s;ed and dete&s;ted by all, he dragged on a mi&s;erable life of dependence, and was finally killed at the battle of Viana, where he &s;erved as a volunteer.</P>
<P>Such was the i&s;&s;ue of Cae&s;ar Borgia's ambition and perfidy. The puni&s;hment of his crimes overtook him even here; and Providence, for its own vindi|cation, and in compa&s;&s;ion to poor mortals, frequent|ly exhibits &s;uch examples of ju&s;tice as a warning to others.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE pre&s;ent rebellion is one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular occurrences in the hi&s;tory of mankind. When any remarkable event, like this, pre&s;ents it&s;elf, the mind is naturally led to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome cau&s;e from which it originated. In accounting for the American re|bellion, many have fallen into very great errors, to my certain knowledge; their deci&s;ions were ha&s;ty and partial&mdash;not the re&s;ult of careful, unbia&s;&s;ed in|ve&s;tigation, but of indolence and prejudice.</P>
<P>Nations have been often plunged into civil war by the claims of pretenders to the regal authority, or by the impo&s;ition of enormous taxes, or other oppre&s;&s;i|ons. But evidently the&s;e did not occa&s;ion the pre&s;ent
<PB N="74" REF="016311_0077_0F9C2B558FE01640">
rebellion; for no &s;uch claim, no &s;uch taxes or op|pre&s;&s;ions exi&s;ted in America.</P>
<P>There was not a more free or happy people on earth than the Briti&s;h coloni&s;ts. Without any taxes, but for the &s;upport of their poor&mdash;as free from re|&s;traint of any kind as could con&s;i&s;t with a &s;tate of &s;ociety, they were daily increa&s;ing in wealth and numbers&mdash;daily improving in the arts and embelli&s;h|ments of civil life; and they had the mo&s;t flattering pro&s;pect of an unchecked progre&s;s in each of the&s;e. Yet they have wantonly renounced their rightful and mo&s;t amiable &s;overeign. They have not only waged war again&s;t that &s;tate which gave them exi&s;tence, which always cheri&s;hed them with parental tender|ne&s;s, and rai&s;ed them to their late flouri&s;hing condi|tion; but, like parricides, they have combined with the inveterate enemies of that &s;tate to effect its ruin! Plunging their country, at the &s;ame time, into the deepe&s;t calamities, for the avowed purpo&s;e of e&s;tab|li&s;hing an independent republic!</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that clamarous complaints were made of grievances and oppre&s;&s;ions. But the&s;e undeniably were made to inflame peoples minds, and &s;timulate them to &s;edition. Had the rebellion originated from real grievances, a redre&s;s of tho&s;e grievances, re|peatedly offered on the part of government, had long &s;ince compo&s;ed our troubles. Ample &s;ecurity again&s;t taxation was held out, an accommodation proffered; you contemptuou&s;ly rejected both, and the rebellion went on with the &s;ame determined malice and ob&s;ti|nacy as before.</P>
<P>Ambition and a lu&s;t of domination in &s;ome a&s;piring individuals, have mo&s;t frequently produced inte&s;tine wars. But &s;uch men mu&s;t always have proper ma|terials

to work upon&mdash;there mu&s;t al&s;o be a particular concurrence of circum&s;tances to favour their de&s;igns, or el&s;e they could not be &s;ucce&s;sful. There were periods in the Athenian, Roman and Briti&s;h hi&s;tories when <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus, Catiline</HI> or <HI>Cromwell</HI> could not have carried their de&s;igns into execution. The venal and ver&s;atile di&s;po&s;ition of the Athenians proved fa|vourable to the fir&s;t; the abandoned profligacy which reigned at Rome promoted the dark purpo&s;es of the &s;econd; and the prevalence of enthu&s;ia&s;m and repub|lican principles in Britain, contributed to rai&s;e the la&s;t to de&s;poti&s;m: Had not republican, Democratic principles been as prevalent in America as they were then in Britain, your Congre&s;s had not attained their pre&s;ent u&s;urped power.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;ome of your European friends have a&s;&s;erted that neither the Congre&s;s, nor their adherents were tinctured with republicani&s;m. But you very ju&s;tly laughed at the folly of men who thus judged without knowledge, and decided without examination. You owed them no thanks for their officious zeal, &s;ince every part of your conduct gave the lie to their a&s;&s;er|tion; and on their &s;cheme, the whole of your procedure would be ridiculou&s;ly prepo&s;terous and contradictory. The principles which you publi&s;hed to the world, and on which you attempted to ju&s;tify your rebelli|on, were perfectly democratic: Swarms of zealots &s;tarted up in every province to vindicate tho&s;e prin|ciples, and carry your mea&s;ures into execution&mdash; mea&s;ures directly calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h a republic, and bani&s;h every ve&s;tige of monarchy&mdash;and mea&s;ures to which you have &s;ince invariably adhered. After this, to deny that the American rebels were infected with republicani&s;m, is at once a violation of truth, an in&s;ult on our under&s;tanding, and an injury to you.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="016311_0079_0F9C2B57333B7E68">What tho&s;e cau&s;es were, whether local, political, or religious, which diffu&s;ed a &s;pirit of democracy through America&mdash;who were mo&s;t infected with it, and con&s;equently, your mo&s;t zealous partizans&mdash; what the circum&s;tances which prepared the way, or &s;erved to inflame the rebellion, are points which I &s;hall not enlarge on.

Suf|fice it to &s;ay&mdash;that as matters were &s;ituated in Ame|rica, &s;ome &s;uch convul&s;ion as the pre&s;ent was una|voidable, &s;ooner or later. All judicious men here expected it. Deep rooted republicani&s;m, democratic, levelling principles, ever unfriendly to monarchy, had &s;pread their baneful influence far and wide. Actuated by the&s;e, your adherents were di&s;po&s;ed to revolt: The ambition, artifice, and duplicity of the Congre&s;s did the re&s;t. From the&s;e combined cau&s;es &s;prung this mo&s;t dete&s;table rebellion; neither of which &s;ingly had been adequate to &s;uch an effect.

But you &s;eem to be &s;teeled pretty well again&s;t &s;uch qualms at pre&s;ent, and have given them to the winds.</P>
<P>America now groans under all the complicated mi&s;eries which civil war, that &s;evere&s;t &s;courge which incen&s;ed Heaven can inflict on a guilty people, is capable of producing. Her provinces are filled with di&s;cord, animo&s;ity and inhuman murders. Com|merce is ruined, indu&s;try and u&s;eful arts are drooping, and nearly extingui&s;hed. Scenes of de&s;olation&mdash;of the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s are every were to be &s;een. Thou|&s;ands who lived in ea&s;e and affluence are reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb of poverty; or bani&s;hed from their once happy and peaceful habitations. The orphan's and the widow's tears are mingled with tho&s;e of af|flicted parents, for their re&s;pective relatives, cut off by the de&s;troying &s;word. Tho&s;e who &s;hould be em|ployed in offices of mutual tenderne&s;s, are &s;timulated by ho&s;tile rage again&s;t each other: Not only &s;ubject warring again&s;t fellow &s;ubject; but parent and child, brother and brother &s;tand forth to &s;hed each other's blood.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are the fruits of your ambition! The&s;e the effects of your u&s;urpation! Yet not content with the&s;e, you are re&s;olved to &s;pread the circle of human

A more effectual method perhaps could not be devi&s;ed to ex|tingui&s;h all &s;en&s;e of duty and obligation, unhinge &s;ociety, and make mankind a &s;et of unprincipled villains.

<P>SIR WILLIAM PETTY, in his <HI>Political Anatomy of Ireland,</HI> has made an e&s;timate of the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by that Kingdom, during the great rebellion which began in 1641. His method is to rate at a certain va|lue the lives that were lo&s;t, the hou&s;es, cattle, &amp;c. that were de&s;troyed, the decrea&s;e of rents and value of lands, the expence of armies, &amp;c. I &s;hall follow the method pointed out by this acute and ingenious &s;tate&s;|man, in e&s;timating the lo&s;&s;es of this continent by your rebellion, without knowingly exaggerating any par|ticular. It is impo&s;&s;ible to be perfectly exact and ac|curate in &s;uch calculations. No more is to be expected than that we &s;hould come as near the truth as we can.</P>

In political calculations, the value of men, women and children, above a century ago in England, was &s;tated at &pound;.70 &s;terling each, one with another. The comparative value of money was then greater than it is now, and con&s;equently, the valua|tion &s;hould now be higher; e&s;pecially as men only, who generally were in the vigour of life, are included in the above e&s;timate. But to avoid the &s;u&s;picion of exaggeration, I &s;hall fix it at &pound;.70. The lo&s;s of America therefore, by the&s;e 70,000 men, is &pound;. 4,900,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>The rapid population of America was principally owing to the great number of emigrants who came from Europe. For twenty years immediately pre|ceeding 1775, the number of emigrants annually im|ported, taking one year with another, was not le&s;s than 4000; but emigrations have cea&s;ed &s;ince that year, that is, for four years pa&s;t, &s;ince the rebellion commenced; con&s;equently the emigrants for that &s;pace, amounting to 16,000, &s;hould be &s;et down as &s;o much lo&s;s to America.

<P>I an&s;wer&mdash;that by prohibiting exportation, the va|lue of all produce and articles of commerce unavoid|ably &s;unk; they mu&s;t either remain on hand, or be &s;old for Congre&s;s money, which is good for little or nothing. The exports to France and the We&s;t-In|dies were very trifling; and the returns for them were chiefly ammunition, arms, cannon and military &s;tores, which are of no u&s;e to the farmers of Ame|rica, and have been made the engines of their ruin.

HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS STERLING, has America lo&s;t by the pre&s;ent rebellion! By &s;o much is &s;he now poorer, than &s;he would have been, if this rebellion had not happened. I am per&s;uaded that many of tho&s;e articles are under-rated, and am not con&s;cious that any one of them is above the truth. I have allowed nothing for the pay and other expences of your armies, as the&s;e were defray|ed with continental money, the credit of which is ir|retrievably &s;unk, and is &s;o much lo&s;t to the conti|nent. Its pernicious con&s;equences will be &s;en&s;ibly felt by all the coloni&s;ts; but they will be peculiarly ruinous to helple&s;s widows and orphans.</P>
<P>Now, for what has all this profu&s;e wa&s;te of blood and trea&s;ure been made?&mdash;For &s;ake of overturning the be&s;t of civil con&s;titutions! For &s;ake of a nominal independency, which, if e&s;tabli&s;hed, would be more de&s;tructive to this continent, for ages to come, than even the pre&s;ent rebellion has been! For &s;ake of a ruinous alliance with France, the enemy of liberty and prote&s;tanti&s;m&mdash;of the honour of M. <HI>Gerard</HI>'s company for a few months, and that the Congre&s;s might bear &s;way over the&s;e de&s;olated provinces!</P>
<P>Whil&s;t mentioning the effects of your rebellion, the di&s;graceful, wretched &s;tate of France &s;hould not be pa&s;&s;ed over. As &s;he &s;hared in your guilt, &s;o hath &s;he de&s;ervedly and deeply &s;hared in your calamities. France, in the time of profound peace with Britain, amid&s;t the mo&s;t &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, and without even the pretence of provocation, took part in your rebellion, and &s;ent over a large fleet here to attack the power with which &s;he was at peace! Af|ter hovering a few months on this coa&s;t, without do|ing any thing but to proclaim the perfidy of his nati|on, <HI>D'E&s;taing</HI> retreated to the We&s;t-Indies. There,
<PB N="85" REF="016311_0088_0F9C2B6075FB59E8">
one of the French i&s;lands was taken under his eye; and his own fleet blocked up at Martinico, without daring to venture out to &s;ea. The French We&s;t-In|dia trade is nearly ruined. The French fi&s;heries at Newfoundland are annihilated&mdash;Pondicherry, the only place of any con&s;equence which France po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the Ea&s;t-Indies, is wre&s;ted from her, and her Ea&s;t-In|dia company and trade totally ruined. Her trade in Europe is in little better plight&mdash;her merchant &s;hips taken, her fleets blocked up, her merchants bankrupt, her government without credit at home or abroad, and covered with indelible infamy, A ju&s;t reward this of her perfidy! May all who act in the &s;ame in|&s;idious manner, meet with a like fate!</P>
<P>I &s;hould now examine what your pre&s;ent &s;tate and pro&s;pects are; but as this would require too much time, I &s;hall defer it to my next; and &s;hall only add, for the pre&s;ent, &s;ome reflections of the excellent Mr. ADDISON on the nature and guilt of rebellion.&mdash; You cannot &s;u&s;pect him of partiality to <HI>Tories,</HI> or of being di&s;affected to the Congre&s;s. You may therefore &s;afely attend to his &s;entiments, and allow them their ju&s;t weight&mdash;they are very applicable to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"That rebellion is one of the mo&s;t heinous crimes which it is in the power of man to commit, &s;ays this admired writer, may appear from &s;everal con&s;iderations. Fir&s;t, as it de&s;troys the end of all government, and the benefits of civil &s;ociety. Go|vernment was in&s;tituted for maintaining the peace, &s;afety and happine&s;s of a people. The&s;e great ends are brought about by a general conformity and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to that frame of laws which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in every community, for the protection of the innocent, and the puni&s;hment of the guilty. As on the one
<PB N="86" REF="016311_0089_0F9C2B614B0FF090">
&s;ide, men are &s;ecured in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lives, properties and every thing they have a right to: So on the other &s;ide, tho&s;e who offer them any in|jury in the&s;e particulars, are &s;ubject to penalties pro|portioned to their offences. Government therefore mitigates the inequality of power among particular per&s;ons, and makes an innocent man, though of the lowe&s;t rank, a match for the mightie&s;t of his fellow-&s;ubjects; &s;ince he has the force of the whole com|munity on his &s;ide, which is able to controul the in|&s;olence or inju&s;tice of any oppre&s;&s;or.&mdash;Now rebellion di&s;appoints all the&s;e benefits of government, by rai&s;ing a power in oppo&s;ition to that authority which has been e&s;tabli&s;hed among a people for their mutual welfare. So that rebellion is as great an evil to &s;o|ciety, as government it&s;elf is a ble&s;&s;ing."</P>
<P>"In the next place, rebellion is a violation of all tho&s;e engagements which every government exacts from &s;uch per&s;ons as live under it; and con&s;equent|ly, the mo&s;t ba&s;e and pernicious in&s;tance of treachery and per&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s. The guilt of rebellion increa&s;es in proportion as the&s;e engagements are &s;olemn and obligatory. Thus if a man makes his way to re|bellion through perjury, he gives additional horror to that crime which is in it&s;elf of the blacke&s;t nature."</P>
<P>"We may likewi&s;e con&s;ider rebellion as a greater complication of wickedne&s;s than any other crime we can commit. It is big with rapine, &s;acrilege and murder. It is dreadful in its milde&s;t effects, as it impoveri&s;hes the public; ruins particular families; begets and perpetuates hatreds among fellow &s;ub|jects, friends and relations; makes a country the &s;eat of war and de&s;olation, and expo&s;es it to the at|tempts of its foreign enemies. In &s;hort&punc; as it is impo&s;&s;ible for it to take effect, or to make the &s;malle&s;t

progre&s;s, but through a continued cour&s;e of violence and blood&s;hed, a robber or a murderer looks like an innocent man, when we compare him with a re|bel."</P>
<P>What a contra&s;t is there between the&s;e &s;entiments, and tho&s;e of Machiavel, quoted in my la&s;t! In the former, we are warned of the guilt and ruinous ef|fects of rebellion and u&s;urpation, and di&s;&s;uaded from the perpetration of &s;uch crimes: In the latter, men are &s;timulated to u&s;urpation, and the methods are taught by which their crimes may be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. Addi&s;on, like one of tho&s;e pure intelligences that are delegated by infinite wi&s;dom to &s;uperintend the government of the univer&s;e, would diffu&s;e bene|volence, peace, harmony and happine&s;s among man|kind: Machiavel, like a dark friend, that delighted in human mi&s;ery, would &s;ubvert all order, lead men to the commi&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t enormities, and &s;pread deva&s;tation and ruin throughout the earth.</P>
<P>It were needle&s;s for me to &s;ay which of <HI>the&s;e</HI> it is that your Congre&s;s have li&s;tned to&mdash;<HI>who&s;e</HI> precepts they have practi&s;ed. The u&s;urpation and rebellion which now di&s;grace America, with all their conco|mitant train of evils&mdash;tyranny, blood&s;hed, de&s;olation, &amp;c. will not &s;uffer us to doubt that Machiavel's le&s;|&s;ons have been reduced to practice on this Continent.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. To JOHN JAY, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING briefly pointed out in my la&s;t, the cau&s;es which produced this unnatural Rebel|lion, and the effects of it, particularly the lo&s;&s;es which America hath &s;u&s;tained, I now wait on you to examine the pre&s;ent &s;tate and pro&s;pects of the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>You have invaded the rights, and trampled on the authority of your Sovereign&mdash;You have &s;ported with the lives, property and happine&s;s of your fel|low &s;ubjects&mdash;You have diffu&s;ed wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery through this once flouri&s;hing country&mdash;and have employed every artifice of deceit, duplicity and violence&mdash;to attain your pre&s;ent u&s;urped power: What this &s;ituation, for which you have &s;acrificed &s;o much, now promi&s;es&mdash;what the probable i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e enormities will be, are que&s;tions in which you and every Briti&s;h &s;ubject mu&s;t be deeply intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Your Congre&s;s have kindly &s;tepped forth to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in this inquiry. Your Addre&s;s <HI>to the Inhabitants of the United States,</HI> dated the 26th of la&s;t May, gives a gloomy picture of your affairs, and contains repre&s;entations which would be deemed by your partizans as the re&s;ult of malignity, had they been made by me. I hope they will pay the more atten|tion
<PB N="89" REF="016311_0092_0F9C205AEE42C600">
to what I &s;hall now &s;ay, as it has the &s;uffrage of the Congre&s;s to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to examine minutely the whole of this Addre&s;s. I &s;hall pa&s;s over your u&s;ual cant&mdash;your pro&s;titution of &s;cripture&mdash;your &s;ophi&s;try, and artful application to the pa&s;&s;ions of the people, by which you would cajole and reconcile them to their de&s;truction. I &s;hall content my&s;elf with offer|ing a few &s;trictures on &s;uch parts as tend to elucidate the &s;ubject before us.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes me, is, the remarkable difference, as to your hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, between this Addre&s;s, and your <HI>Ob&s;ervations on the American Revolution</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This pamphlet is perhaps one of the mo&s;t extraordinary that has appeared during the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. It was drawn up by a Committee of the Congre&s;s, and publi&s;hed by their authority. The greate&s;t part of it con&s;i&s;ts of extracts from former addre&s;&s;es and other publications of the Congre&s;s; but "having the fear of M. Gerard before them," they have cau|tiou&s;ly avoided that pa&s;&s;age in their Addre&s;s to the people of Great-Britain, dated September 5, 1774, where the Congre&s;s tell their loving Friends and fellow Subjects,
<Q>nor can we &s;uppre&s;s our a&s;toni&s;hment, that a Briti&s;h Parliament &s;hould ever con&s;ent to e&s;tabli&s;h in that country (Canada) a reli|gion (meaning Popery) which has deluged your I&s;land in blood, and di&s;per&s;ed impiety, bigotry&punc; per&s;ecution, murder and rebellion through every part of the world.</Q></P>
<P>The apparent de&s;ign of the Congre&s;s in the "Ob&s;ervations," was to counteract the tendency of the papers which had pa&s;|&s;ed between the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners and the Congre&s;s, and were publi&s;hed by the former previous to their departure hence, and reconcile the Americans to the criminal conduct of the Congre&s;s, in rejecting the liberal overtures of Govern|ment for an accommodation. A judgment may be formed of this pamphlet from the following particulars.&mdash;</P>
<P>It a&s;&s;erts, that the fir&s;t Briti&s;h
<Q>Adventurers to America, were in a &s;tate of nature, alike free either to &s;ubmit to a &s;ociety exi&s;ting, or to e&s;tabli&s;h one, as their inclination or intere&s;t might prompt&mdash; that they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> independent con&s;titutions,&mdash;that &s;timulated by their nece&s;&s;ities, and &s;educed by antient habits, they were prevailed on to &s;ub|ject them&s;elves to the King of England, in con&s;equence of his &s;olemn promi&s;e to afford them protection,&mdash;that the Briti&s;h Colonies were in fact &s;o many independent &s;tates, who&s;e only political connection with each other, and with the &s;everal parts of the Briti&s;h empire, was by means of a common Sovereign.</Q>
Page 2.3.</P>
<P>Had the Congre&s;s declared, that
<Q>they were the children of the Sun, and &s;ent by their beneficent parent to in|&s;truct and reclaim the Coloni&s;ts,</Q>
as MANCO CAPAC and MAMA OCOLLO declared to the Peruvians, it would not be a jot more fabulous or contrary to truth, than the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how any men could have the effrontery to obtrude &s;uch palpable fal&s;ehoods on the world, when there are &s;o many hi&s;tories of the&s;e Colonies which re|fute them. The Briti&s;h Colonies were &s;ettled under charters, tho&s;e charters were granted by the King, and &s;pecified the civil con&s;titutions of the Colonies re&s;pectively&mdash;the emigrants were as much &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h Crown, as dependent on the &s;upreme legi&s;lature of the empire, 'after,' as 'before', their emigration; and &s;ome of tho&s;e charters explicitly recognize the right of the Briti&s;h Parliament to tax the Colonies&mdash;But to proceed with the pamphlet&mdash;</P>
<P>It in&s;inuates, and would per&s;uade the world, that the ex|tract of his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions to Sir HENRY CLINTON, authorizing Sir HENRY to ratify the Convention of Sarato|ga, and which Sir HENRY tran&s;mitted to the Congre&s;s, was a FORGERY,
<Q>that it had a fraudulent complexion&mdash; that it is very po&s;&s;ible no &s;uch letter, as the Secretary's of State containing tho&s;e in&s;tructions, was ever written, that we cannot argue again&s;t &s;uch deceit from the ba&s;ene&s;s of it; for tho&s;e who would do the many treacherous acts they had committed during the war&mdash;could hardly boggle at the &s;ending as an extract from a Secretary of States letter what really was not &s;uch an extract.</Q>
Page 110.</P>
<P>And it threatens an inva&s;ion of Britain&mdash;
<Q>the dreaded &s;calping knife it&s;elf may, in the hands of our riflemen, &s;pread horror through their I&s;land.</Q>
Page 120. The&s;e are matters to which I &s;hall return no an&s;wer, and indeed they require none&punc; I am told that Mr. W. H. Drayton of South-Carolina, was one of the Committee appointed by the Con|gre&s;s to draw up this pamphlet, and its principal Fabricator.</P></NOTE>, publi&s;hed la&s;t winter, <HI>The Ob&s;erva|tions</HI>

<Q>That the efforts of Great-Britain to reduce tho&s;e United States, are now almo&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="016311_0094_0F9C2063B67AD6A0">
brought to a conclu&s;ion:</Q>
The Addre&s;s tells us that tho&s;e efforts are multiplied,&mdash;it evidently &s;peaks the language of de&s;pondency, and &s;ugge&s;ts the idea of a <HI>la&s;t &s;peech.</HI> You bid us indeed&mdash;"not think you de&s;pair of the Commonwealth;" but you manife&s;tly betray de&s;pair&mdash;ju&s;t as the tremor and agitation of a culprit betrays his guilt, though he loudly declares his innocence. From your own repre&s;entation of matters, it is impo&s;&s;ible for any unprejudiced per&s;on to think otherwi&s;e than that your cau&s;e is de&s;perate. The truth is, your circum&s;tances are greatly chang|ed, and your language is changed with them.</P>
<P>After mentioning
<Q>the great and increa&s;ing de|preciation of your currency, and the mi&s;chiefs that have flowed from it,</Q>
you enumerate &s;everal cau&s;es, to which that depreciation, you think, was owing&mdash;&s;uch as
<Q>frequent emi&s;&s;ions, and the pro|digious &s;ums, emitted, the artifices of men who enrich them&s;elves, by monopolizing the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life, the mi&s;conduct of inferior officers in the public &s;ervice, and farmers rai&s;ing the price of their produce.</Q>
But you have thought proper to conceal other cau&s;es which have contributed more than any of the&s;e to the depreciation of your currency&mdash;the&s;e are the fluctuating &s;tate of your affairs, of your u&s;urped power, and the de&s;poti&s;m of your government.</P>
<P>Paper currency is the &s;ign or repre&s;entation of money, as money is, by general con&s;ent, the &s;ign or repre&s;entation of all merchandize, of all commodi|ties whatever. Money, <HI>i. e.</HI> gold and &s;ilver, and ar|ticles
<PB N="92" REF="016311_0095_0F9C20660F229E58">
of merchandize, mutually repre&s;ent each other. Hence, money has ah intrin&s;ic value&mdash;this value is not impaired by any accident, by the mo&s;t violent &s;hocks of war; carry it to any part of the globe, its value will be acknowledged.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of paper currency is totally different.&mdash; Having no <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> value, its credit and <HI>nominal</HI> va|lue wholly depend on the &s;ecurity by which it is &s;upported. Take away that &s;ecurity, and like an edifice who&s;e foundation is removed, it in&s;tantly &s;inks. If a man can have money at all times for his paper currency or bills, &s;o far the currency is good, and an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of money. If moderately emitted, the credit of currency may al&s;o be provided for by taxes in times of peace and &s;ecurity; for in &s;uch ca&s;es the whole community is engaged to &s;up|port its credit, and can fulfil the engagement. This credit however at be&s;t can only be <HI>local,</HI> differing e&s;|&s;entially in this re&s;pect from money, which hath an intrin&s;ic value, and is therefore univer&s;ally received. Let me add, that it is in free and mild governments only that paper currency can maintain its credit. Ty|ranny produces di&s;tru&s;t and unhinges &s;ecurity; the&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily de&s;troy public credit. Thus it is ob&s;erved, that in de&s;potic &s;tates, even money di&s;ap|pears. Men frequently bury their money, as the only way to &s;ecure it; and thus many of the weal|thie&s;t Americans, when the de&s;poti&s;m of the Congre&s;s commenced, actually buried their money and plate, and large quantities of each lie buried, to this day, without the Briti&s;h lines.</P>
<P>The above ob&s;ervations are very plain and obvious, and I think incontrovertibly true. They will a&s;&s;i&s;t in accounting for the downfal of your currency. The fir&s;t rea&s;on you a&s;&s;ign for its depreciation, is certainly a good one. The &s;ums you emitted were
<PB N="93" REF="016311_0096_0F9C2066CBB62F28">
&s;o enormou&s;ly large, that all the taxable property of the revolted colonies was in&s;ufficient to &s;upport their credit; con&s;equently, the credit of that currency mu&s;t inevitably &s;ink.</P>
<P>But if it be farther con&s;idered, that tho&s;e mon&s;trous emi&s;&s;ions had no legal &s;upport&mdash;that the authority on which they re&s;ted, was u&s;urped and conte&s;ted&mdash;that the &s;word of ju&s;tice hung over tho&s;e who emitted the currency, and their power was utterly precarious and fluctuating&mdash;that their government was an u&s;urped tyranny which flung every thing into confu&s;ion, and filled every brea&s;t with anxiety and di&s;tru&s;t: When the&s;e particulars are con&s;idered, the wonder is not that your currency &s;hould be &s;o much depreciated; but that it &s;hould have any value whatever&mdash; Nothing but the bayonet has &s;upported the &s;mall degree of credit it hath hitherto retained; but that violent expedient can no longer afford it credit&mdash; it is irreparably &s;unk, and pa&s;t your power to re|trieve it.</P>
<P>You very unkindly throw the blame of this di&s;a&s;ter on others&mdash;on monopolizers, the mi&s;conduct of offi|cers, that is, in plain Engli&s;h, on peculators, who have robbed the public, and on farmers who rai&s;ed the price of their produce. With re&s;pect to farmers, the accu&s;ation is unju&s;t, and a mere blunder of your own. It is mi&s;taking the effect for the cau&s;e. The currency did not &s;ink becau&s;e the farmer rai&s;ed the price of his produce; but he therefore rai&s;ed his produce, becau&s;e the credit of your currency had &s;unk. And pray what is there unju&s;t or unrea&s;onable in this? Why does the farmer toil and &s;weat, but that he may enjoy the fruits of his labour? If your cur|rency hath &s;unk to a <HI>thirtieth</HI> part of its nominal va|lue, is it unju&s;t or unrea&s;onable in the farmer to de|mand
<PB N="94" REF="016311_0097_0F9C20678F253668">
<HI>thirty</HI> times as much of that currency for any article as it formerly co&s;t?</P>
<P>As to peculators and monopolizers, I have no con|te&s;t with you. I believe you have ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain of them. The large fortunes ama&s;&s;ed by many of your dependents and partizans, &s;ufficiently evince your complaints to be well grounded. I could name a Pr&mdash;&s;b-t&mdash;an Par&s;on, not many leagues from this city, who was not worth a groat when this re|bellion began; but being a flaming patriot and friend of the Congre&s;s, he was put into the Commi&s;&s;ary's department; and it is affirmed that he hath already realized an e&s;tate of 25,000l. reckoning a dollar at 8s.&mdash;this is only one in&s;tance out of very, very many that I could mention.</P>
<P>But I am not plea&s;ed with the Congre&s;s for at|empting to &s;hift the blame from them&s;elves in this matter, when they are chiefly guilty, and throw it on others. You &s;tigmatize and accu&s;e others of pe|culation; but, are you innocent and &s;potle&s;s your|&s;elves? Mr. <HI>Deane</HI>'s publications, and others which they gave ri&s;e to, induce the world to think you are not quite immaculate. The large e&s;tates now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by members of the Congre&s;s, who we <HI>know</HI> were bankrupts when they took their &s;eats in that <HI>augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly</HI> heighten people's &s;u&s;picions. Nay, &s;ome do not he&s;itate to aver that the Congre&s;s have been tam|pering with French gold; for that nothing el&s;e can account for their adherence to France, contrary to every dictate of rea&s;on and duty&mdash;every principle of prote&s;tanti&s;m and good policy, and to the manife&s;t intere&s;t of America. Nor are the&s;e &s;u&s;picions in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed by a certain tran&s;action which &s;ome of your members took &s;pecial care to make public, and from which they affected to derive great merit,
<PB N="95" REF="016311_0098_0F9C20685138FF20">
as if they were above corruption and bribery. No|thing is more frequent with de&s;igning men than to &s;eize little incidents, and by their help lay in a &s;tock of merit with the &s;imple populace, at a cheap rate, to be employed on future occa&s;ions, and turned to their own advantage. Hereby they think to act with more &s;ecurity, and indulge with le&s;s &s;u&s;picion in that very vice they &s;eemed coy in admitting&mdash;ju&s;t like &s;ome termagant females, who pro&s;ecute one man for a rape, whil&s;t they invite and run into the lewd em|braces of another.</P>
<P>But to leave tho&s;e matters which, I pre&s;ume, are among the "reproaches that are peculiar to you," as you tell the Americans, and advert to things which are unque&s;tionably acknowledged. You &s;ay, by way of apology, that
<Q>emitting paper money was an expedient which had been before frequently and &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed on this continent.</Q>
Very true&mdash;but you will plea&s;e to remember that tho&s;e emi&s;&s;ions were comparatively &s;mall; and they had all the &s;ecurity that the Legi&s;lature, of which the King is an e&s;&s;ential part, could give to &s;upport their credit. Hence they derived &s;tability and value, and an&s;wer|ed the de&s;ired purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, are the&s;e ca&s;es parallel? You know they are not&mdash;they differ in every material circum&s;tance. Your emi&s;&s;ions were &s;o immoderately large, that the Co|lonies were unable to &s;upport their credit; they were i&s;&s;ued in direct oppo&s;ition to the King's authority, and in the mid&s;t of tumults, when no adequate &s;e|curity could po&s;&s;ibly be given; their depreciation therefore was unavoidable. All this you knew per|fectly well, yet you daily emitted new &s;ums&mdash;each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive emi&s;&s;ion exceeding the one that preceded. Are not you then changeable with all the mi&s;chiefs
<PB N="96" REF="016311_0099_0F9C2069D42DC580">
flowing from this di&s;a&s;ter? In a word, your currency had its birth from rebellion, its &s;upport from vio|lence, and it mu&s;t end in the ruin of thou&s;ands, who will ju&s;tly lay that ruin to the account of the Con|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>But in order to cheer the &s;pirits of your partizans, you mention an expedient by which your currency may be retrieved; and that is <HI>Taxation.</HI> According|ly you demand, with very little ceremony, the &s;um of <HI>forty-five million of dollars,</HI> from the Coloni&s;ts, in addition to <HI>fifteen millions</HI> which were demanded be|fore; and both &s;ums amounting to <HI>&s;ixty millions of dollars,</HI> and equal to <HI>thirteen millions of pounds &s;terl.</HI> are to be paid within the current year. This is tax|ing with a vengeance! Such a demand by the French King, arbitrary as he is, from 16 millions of va&s;&s;als, would throw France into convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>But hereby the credit of your currency is to be rai&s;ed! Perhaps this is one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impo&s;itions which the Congre&s;s have yet played off on their de|luded va&s;&s;als. Suppo&s;ing this immen&s;e &s;um were actually levied and paid in, will the quantity of your currency be le&s;s at the year's end, than when it be|gan? No&mdash;the expenditure of the pre&s;ent year will require more than tho&s;e <HI>&s;ixty millions of dollars</HI>; and mu&s;t not the money be &s;truck to an&s;wer that expen|diture, being immediately wanted? How great your expence mu&s;t be, let any one judge, when you are obliged frequently to give 500l. to a man for &s;erving in your army a few months.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing however that your debts and the quan|tity of your currency &s;hould not be greater, Jan. 1, 1780, than they were, Jan. 1, 1779; yet remember, the taxable property of your &s;ubjects will be greatly

dimini&s;hed. Two of your <HI>States,</HI> I may &s;ay, are already gone; &s;hould the other <HI>eleven</HI> even remain in your hands, which is not a very clear point, yet the ravages of war will certainly thin their inhabitants and de&s;troy much property. Here then your debts and the quantity of your currency will continue the &s;ame, whil&s;t your ability to di&s;charge the one and &s;upport the other, will be very much dimini&s;hed. Even now, your currency, like an execrated thing, is &s;hunned by all who can avoid it; at the clo&s;e of the current year, a Congre&s;s dollar will probably have no more value than a common rag of equal di|men&s;ions.</P>
<P>To con&s;ole your partizans &s;till further, you tell them,&mdash;
<Q>the conduct of one Monarch, the Friend and protector of the rights of mankind, has turned the &s;cale &s;o much, that all the vi&s;ionary &s;chemes of your gigantic adver&s;ary,</Q>
meaning your Sove|reign, "have vani&s;hed." In truth, Sir, con&s;idering the mi&s;chiefs you have brought on France, it is a pity to quarrel with you for affording her &s;ome kind and gracious words, &s;ince you can give her no more. Yet it is worth ob&s;erving how the Congre&s;s are fated to unite in them&s;elves the mo&s;t glaring contradictions &mdash;profe&s;&s;ing to be the patrons of liberty, candour and republicani&s;m, they exhau&s;t our language in ful&s;om adulation to the mo&s;t ambitious, re&s;tle&s;s and faithle&s;s Monarchy in chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>Whoever is acquainted with the hi&s;tory of France, mu&s;t know, that to the efforts of <HI>Richlieu,</HI> &s;he owes her lo&s;s of liberty, and the de&s;poti&s;m of her monarchs; and that the maxims of that Machiavelian &s;tate&s;man are tho&s;e by which the conduct of her government has been regulated &s;ince his time. Among&s;t tho&s;e maxims, <HI>Monte&s;quieu,</HI> a Frenchman, tells us, the
<PB N="98" REF="016311_0101_0F9C206B49E1B190">
following is one&mdash;
<Q>If there &s;hould chance to be &s;ome unlucky hone&s;t man among the people, Cardinal Richlieu in his political te&s;tament &s;eems to hint that a Prince &s;hould take care not to employ him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spirit of Laws, Book III. Chap. 5.</NOTE>.</Q>
How far this maxim was adhered to in the appoint|ment of your French <HI>Plenipotentiary,</HI> or in that of the <HI>Admiral</HI> who was &s;ent to your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall not determine&mdash;you can be&s;t judge. Probably, this may have al&s;o become a fa&s;hionable maxim with you.</P>
<P>France, by the very act in which &s;he engaged to be your ally, announced her perfidy in &s;uch a man|ner as to remove all ju&s;t confidence in her friend&s;hip. She would as &s;oon break her treaty with you as with Britain, if &s;he could gain by it; and you mu&s;t be con&s;cious, that it was not from affection to you or to the rights of mankind, but to &s;erve her own am|bitious purpo&s;es, that &s;he joined in your cau&s;e. By duplicity, intrigue, perfidy and violence, France has gained more provinces in Europe than you had to be&s;tow in America; and &s;he gained them without a claim half &s;o plau&s;ible as you gave her to the <HI>Thirteen United States.</HI> Burgundy, Al&s;ace, the Netherlands &amp;c. &amp;c. can fully te&s;tify this, as well as the poor <HI>Cor&s;icans</HI> within, our memory, who were &s;old to France by their late republican ma&s;ters and tyrants. The Cor&s;icans and French Prote&s;tants will, doubtle&s;s, join heartily in your panegyric.</P>
<P>What you can rationally expect from France at pre&s;ent, is beyond my comprehen&s;ion. She is unable to protect her own trade or foreign &s;ettlements, how then can &s;he protect or a&s;&s;i&s;t you? She cannot lend you money, for &s;he has it not to lend; and even
<PB N="99" REF="016311_0102_0F9C206E2FA73418">
your bills on France have been prote&s;ted. Her King's palaces and gardens are going to ruins for want of money to repair them. The Agents of France are &s;oliciting loans for the &s;upport of her pre&s;ent arma|ments, in every neighbouring &s;tate that has money to &s;pare; yet her credit is &s;o low, that they can &s;carce|ly procure a &s;ingle liyre. If you think, at lea&s;t, that &s;uch a diver&s;ion will be made by the French war, that this continent will be neglected by Britain, and you permitted to e&s;tabli&s;h your independency, you will find your&s;elves egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken. The war with France will be principally on that element, where Britain confe&s;&s;edly &s;urpa&s;&s;es any power in the world, in &s;trength, dexterity and &s;kill. She can line this coa&s;t with &s;hips of war, and &s;till retain a &s;uffi|cient force to cru&s;h the naval power of France. Your ally, for his own pre&s;ervation, mu&s;t abandon you, and leave you to your fate. With all the infamy of a French faction, yet without French a&s;&s;i&s;tance, you mu&s;t &s;truggle again&s;t your "gigantic adver&s;ary;" who, be&s;ides &s;uperior &s;trength, has right and ju&s;tice on his &s;ide, and the cau&s;e of liberty and the prote&s;tant religion to animate his exertions.</P>
<P>Your paper currency and the French alliance were the principal &s;upports of your rebellion. I have therefore dwelt the longer on them. In &s;hewing the credit of the one to be irretrievably lo&s;t, and the other to be of no advantage, but dangerous and di&s;|graceful in the highe&s;t degree, I have &s;o far pointed out your pre&s;ent &s;tate. I now proceed to other parti|culars, which &s;hall be briefly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Before I enter on the&s;e, give me leave to inform you that Britain will not give up this conte&s;t, nor abandon America. Whatever hopes of this kind you may have entertained, whatever reports to this
<PB N="100" REF="016311_0103_0F9C206F9399CE98">
purpo&s;e you have propagated to buoy up the &s;pirits of your partizans, be a&s;&s;ured they were fal&s;e and ground|le&s;s. Britain is <HI>determined</HI> to a&s;&s;ert her ju&s;t claim, and &s;he will contend as earne&s;tly for her American colonies, as &s;he would for any county in England, were it invaded&mdash;&s;et this down therefore as an indu|bitable truth.</P>
<P>Your hopes of foreign loans are by this time va|ni&s;hed. France cannot, Holland or Spain will not lend you money. In conjunction with France, you have endeavoured to drag Spain into the war. But the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted &s;tate of the Spani&s;h government is an effectual bar to it. Be&s;ides, every maxim of &s;ound policy, every dictate of common &s;en&s;e for|bids Spain to countenance your rebellion &mdash;it would be teaching her own coloni&s;ts to rebel&mdash;it would be &s;etting up a rival power in the vicinity of her colo|nies, which in time might wre&s;t them from her.&mdash; Accordingly, Spain is deaf to all your inflammatory exhortations to war.</P>
<P>What then are your internal re&s;ources with which you are to encounter your
<Q>gigantic adver&s;ary, prepared at all points, and of whom even mighty warriors were greatly afraid?</Q>
&mdash;to u&s;e your own mo&s;t <HI>military</HI> and <HI>elegant</HI> phra&s;eology. Men and mo|ney are the &s;inews of war. The ca&s;h account has been already examined&mdash;You mu&s;t depend on a wretched currency, which is pa&s;t all hope, or the po&s;&s;ibility of being retrieved&mdash;no, not even by the fale of the we&s;tern wilderne&s;s, the la&s;t anchor of your hope.</P>
<P>America is thinned of its inhabitants. <HI>Seventy thou&s;and men,</HI> and tho&s;e generally the mo&s;t u&s;eful and indu&s;trious are already &s;wept away. In a coun|try
<PB N="101" REF="016311_0104_0F9C207151D2A328">
&s;o exten&s;ive and &s;o thinly inhabited as America, this lo&s;s mu&s;t be &s;everely felt. Tho&s;e that remain, are harra&s;&s;ed with perpetual mu&s;ters, and called from their nece&s;&s;ary labour to attend the operations of war. If a few determined republicans, and &s;uch as are ve&s;ted with power, and are ama&s;&s;ing fortunes by the public ruin, be excepted; the fir&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal for revolt and enterprize is &s;ub&s;ided, even among your partizans. The people in general are heartily &s;ick of the conte&s;t. The calamities they have &s;uf|fered, the ruin that threatens, joined to your de&s;|poti&s;m, have brought them to their &s;en&s;es. They are aver&s;e to taking arms, and ardently wi&s;h for peace.</P>
<P>Is not this indeed the ca&s;e? Why el&s;e are you re|duced to &s;uch difficulties in rai&s;ing an army? Scarce|ly any will inli&s;t even for a few months. Tho&s;e that do inli&s;t, are tempted by exorbitant premiums; nor would the&s;e avail, were not the poor wretches &s;educed by artful fal&s;ehoods&mdash;&s;uch as accounts of victories never obtained&mdash;public rejoicings for tho&s;e victories&mdash;great and good news from Europe, alto|gether fictitious&mdash;loans, fleets and armies coming over, which never had an exi&s;tence, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash; Whence is the backwardne&s;s of the militia to turn out when called on? Or whence tho&s;e violent and arbitrary methods to draft the militia, and keep up the appearance of an army? Do not the&s;e things evidently &s;hew that the people at large are aver&s;e to your mea&s;ures, that their hearts are not with you? So galling has been your yoke, &s;o in&s;upportable your tyranny, and &s;o dete&s;ted by the coloni&s;ts, that many thou&s;ands of them would this moment <HI>cheerfully</HI> &s;et fire to their own hou&s;es, and de&s;troy them, provided this would contribute to deliver them from their pre&s;ent thraldom, and re&s;tore to them

the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and liberty which they former|ly enjoyed. When &s;o many of your &s;ubjects are lukewarm, &s;o many others di&s;affected, and others again &s;o highly exa&s;perated, your u&s;urped power mu&s;t re&s;t on a very tottering foundation. Even in your army, di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;affection prevail. If half a do|zen of your &s;oldiers are &s;een conver&s;ing together, they are in&s;tantly di&s;per&s;ed by an officer. This I have been a&s;&s;ured of repeatedly by de&s;erters.</P>
<P>You frequently and loudly complained that go|vernment had employed the &s;avages to &s;calp you.&mdash; You did this, when government actually re&s;trained the &s;avages, and would not employ them; and when you were u&s;ing every method in your power to gain the &s;avages, that you might employ them again&s;t go|vernment. Such of the <HI>Oneidas, Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> or <HI>Stock|bridge</HI> Indians and others, as had been previou&s;ly perverted from loyalty, joined you, and have fought your battles. You lately &s;ent a number of commi&s;|&s;ions to Indian Chiefs, and attempts were made by the mo&s;t flagrant fal&s;ehoods, to &s;educe them from the King&mdash;your artifices however proved abortive.</P>
<P>For the&s;e and other rea&s;ons it is become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for government to employ the Indians; and employed they <HI>will</HI> be. You have impo&s;ed this di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity on the Parent State. With very little encouragement, &s;uch a number of Indians may be brought on your frontiers, that in conjunc|tion with the loyali&s;ts, whom you have driven to de&s;|peration, and compelled to join the Indians, they would cut out work enough for all the forces you can mu&s;ter. Doubtle&s;s every precaution and me|thod will be taken to prevent the cruelties which at|tend an Indian war; but it is to be feared that your barbarities to the &s;avages will in &s;ome degree defeat
<PB N="103" REF="016311_0106_0F9C2072CC74B880">
tho&s;e precautions. You have cut off numbers of the Indians, you have de&s;troyed their hou&s;es and &s;ettle|ments, becau&s;e they would not take up the hatchet to &s;upport your rebellion. This will naturally &s;ti|mulate them to revenge, and all the con&s;equent hor|rors mu&s;t be laid to your charge.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t your we&s;tern frontiers are thus expo&s;ed to the ravages of an incen&s;ed enemy, the whole line of &s;ea coa&s;t on the ea&s;t is open to the Briti&s;h fleet and army. To the &s;outhward and northward al&s;o you will feel the power of the Briti&s;h arms. In every quarter you are vulnerable, and in every quarter you will be pre&s;&s;ed; whil&s;t di&s;affection and di&s;tru&s;t, in|ternal feuds and animo&s;ities weaken and con&s;ume your &s;trength.</P>
<P>To compleat the whole, this country, formerly the mo&s;t plentiful perhaps in the world, and mo&s;t abounding in provi&s;ions of every kind, is now threatened with famine. The old &s;tock, which our non-exportation kept on hand, is now con&s;umed or de&s;troyed. The Americans mu&s;t entirely depend upon their annual crops for future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; the&s;e are &s;carcely half as large as they were formerly, and are liable to the &s;ame con&s;umption and de&s;truction that have already &s;wept off much greater quantities of grain. In mo&s;t places the lower cla&s;&s;es are in want of bread; I have been a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome have even peri&s;hed for want of that and the other nece&s;|&s;aries of life. The&s;e wants will unavoidably in|crea&s;e, if the war continues; and your warme&s;t par|tizans in different provinces have declared it as their opinion that a general famine is approaching.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;tate of your affairs which an impartial &s;urvey of them pre&s;ents to us. Yet &s;till you breathe

war and defiance, and multiply your in&s;ults and cruelties&punc; like the devoted Jews when they compelled the mild and generous TITUS to inflict &s;uch &s;evere puni&s;hment on them. In my con&s;cience, I think there is not in the whole compa&s;s of hi&s;tory a ca&s;e to be found &s;o parallel to yours as that of the Jews at the period I mention. Without an object to com|pen&s;ate for the calamities &s;uffered by this country, without any rational pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, and without ability to protect the people who&s;e guardian&s;hip you have a&s;&s;umed&punc; you &s;ubject them to all the mi&s;eries of civil war&punc; and drag them,contrary to their incli|nation and principles&punc; to be &s;laughtered like &s;heep, in the field of battle. This leaves you utterly inex|cu&s;able in the &s;ight of God and man, and covers you with guilt of the deepe&s;t dye!</P>
<P>What then can your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be in &s;uch a &s;ituation? They mu&s;t be gloomy and wretched indeed. Your apprehen&s;ions mu&s;t be terrible when you take time to reflect. But none can form a ju&s;t idea of the &s;en&s;ations peculiar to your &s;ituation, except &s;uch as are plunged equally deep in guilt and rebellion. Whatever terrors a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your demerits may &s;ugge&s;t, I am clearly of opinion that you have more to dread from the re&s;entment of your much in|jured countrymen than from the re&s;entment of Go|vernment or the &s;word of ju&s;tice. The in&s;tances are very numerous where u&s;urpers, who were in&s;trumen|tal in bringing ruin on a people by &s;uch methods as you have practi&s;ed, have fallen victims to the rage of tho&s;e people&punc; and have been torn to pieces by them, however they might have been once idolized. Private rage, impatient at the tardy progre&s;s of public ju&s;|tice, which may he finally eluded, hath &s;natched them from its hand, and devoted them to in&s;tant de&s;truc|tion. Beware of a &s;imilar fate: Human nature is the &s;ame now that it was formerly.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="016311_0108_0F9C20744C7A07E0">When matters are approaching to this cri&s;is, it is not improbable that overtures of accommodation will be made by your Congre&s;s to the Briti&s;h Commander in Chief; or that they will authorize their deputies in Europe to attempt &s;omething of the kind. With how good a grace &s;uch overtures can come from you, after what has happened, I leave your own feelings to determine.</P>
<P>It is certainly a matter of &s;erious con&s;ideration both to government, and to the good people of this coun|try, whether a treaty or any kind &s;hould be held with the Congre&s;s&mdash;whether men, who have &s;o much pro&s;tituted their u&s;urped power, &s;hould ever be admitted to have any hand in the &s;ettlement of the colonies. Certain I am, that good policy on the part of America, as well as of Britain, utterly forbids it. That this country will have a generous con&s;titution, as much freedom and as great privilege, as any part of the Briti&s;h dominions, is what I firmly and religi|ou&s;ly believe. No well informed per&s;on can doubt it. But the&s;e benefits &s;hould immediately flow from go|vernment to the people, through their legal, con&s;ti|tutional a&s;&s;emblies; not through the unhallowed mediation of u&s;urpers, who have laboured to ruin the whole empire, and would be attended with the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this letter, I cannot forbear pay|ing the tribute of applau&s;e which is due to the loyal|i&s;ts of America&mdash;a tribute which truth and ju&s;tice de|mand. If your invention was &s;trained to devi&s;e cru|elties for their trial, they have &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock with no le&s;s firmne&s;s and intrepidity. They have exhibited in&s;tances of und viating loyalty, of un&s;ha|ken, attachment to principle, to the dictates of con|&s;cience, and to the intere&s;t of their country, which
<PB N="106" REF="016311_0109_0F9C20750B35F6F0">
would do honour to any people, in any place, or at any period. They have literally FORSAKEN ALL, that they might adhere to the&s;e. In&s;ults and per&s;e|cution, bonds and impri&s;onment, confi&s;cation and death, have been their bitter portion; yet their for|titude &s;urmounted the&s;e, and they triumphed over you in their &s;ufferings; Your compa&s;&s;ion was with|held from them, but they commanded your e&s;teem; and they had what you <HI>cannot</HI> have, the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience to &s;upport them. Tho' privy to each others &s;entiments, and under the &s;tronge&s;t inducements of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, emoluments and popular applau&s;e, to be treacherous; yet there is no in&s;tance where they violated the mutual confidence, or betrayed the tru&s;t which they repo&s;ed in each other: On the contrary, they have, at the ri&s;que of their lives, always readily afforded whatever aid and affectionate a&s;&s;i&s;tance was in their power, to their loyal brethren, when in di&s;tre&s;s, or under difficulties. Such conduct, which is the re&s;ult of a &s;teady adher|ence to the voice of duty and con&s;cience, reflects lu&s;tre on human nature, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure atones for the ba&s;ene&s;s, perfidy, and other atrocious crimes with which &s;ome of their deluded brethren di&s;grace America at this day.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Brethern and Countrymen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE conduct of the American Congre&s;s, in &s;ome of their recent and mo&s;t important tran&s;actions, hath been developed in the preceding letters, by which a judgment may be formed of their character. Their duplicity and nefarious de&s;igns have been ex|po&s;ed; the origin and cau&s;es of this rebellion, and its ruinous effects have been al&s;o briefly laid before you. Moreover, the pre&s;ent &s;tate and pro&s;pects of the Congre&s;s have been impartially examined. Each of the&s;e hath been done with all good faith and &s;in|cerity; and with the &s;ole view that the truth might be known; and that tho&s;e concerned might profit by it.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e the&s;e papers, I would willingly ad|dre&s;s YOU, my countrymen, and lay before you &s;ome further particulars which are peculiarly intere&s;t|ing at this time. My aim is to give you &s;uch infor|mation as will enable you to judge of matters right|ly, and think for your&s;elves. Happy &s;hall I be, if my endeavours contribute to the&s;e purpo&s;es, and direct you to a proper conduct.</P>
<P>Republicans, &s;mugglers, debtors and men of de&s;|perate fortunes, were the principal promoters of this unnatural rebellion. If to the&s;e be added a very few

Whether &s;uch men were fit to take the lead, and decide wholly for you in things of &s;uch moment, where your lives, liberties, proper|ty and happine&s;s were all at &s;take, I leave you to judge. Nece&s;&s;ity and compul&s;ion, it is true, drew in many to join the&s;e afterwards; others were impo&s;ed on by &s;pecious fal&s;hoods, and thereby &s;educed from their allegiance and intere&s;t; but the&s;e only acted a &s;ubordinate part, and were not initiated into the grand my&s;teries of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The lenity of the Briti&s;h government was con&s;tru|ed here to be the re&s;ult of fear, pu&s;illanimity and im|potence; and afforded lei&s;ure for the &s;chemes of &s;edi|tion to ripen, and for the di&s;affected to di&s;&s;eminate their poi&s;on. Hence the &s;pirit of revolt and rebelli|on &s;pread much wider, and acquired more &s;trength. Whil&s;t every artifice was u&s;ed to vilify government, and make it odious; plau&s;ible objects were held up by the &s;editious leaders, which lulled &s;u&s;picion, re|moved danger out of &s;ight, and promi&s;ed the mo&s;t flattering advantages. By the&s;e methods many well meaning people were duped, and influenced to join them, who have &s;ince lamented their folly, and now deplore the wretched &s;tate of their country.</P>

Vice puts on the &s;emblance of virtue&mdash;ambition, that of patrioti&s;m and generous zeal for the good of others. In addi|tion to all this, men's pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices mingle with their rea&s;onings, pervert their judgement and hurry them into many things which unbia&s;&s;ed rea|&s;on utterly di&s;approves.

<P>In&s;atiable ambition was the di&s;tingui&s;hing charac|teri&s;tic of the Romans. They gratified that ambiti|on by rai&s;ing their own city on the ruins of every other &s;tate.

<P>As fal&s;e patrioti&s;m, i. e. local prejudice and pride, thus &s;educed &s;ome, &s;o others were perverted by a fal&s;e principle of honour. Many, who, in their hearts, di&s;approved of independency, who thought it would be ruinous, and &s;huddered at the crimes which would attend the accompli&s;hing it, yet were led by this prin|ciple to &s;upport the Congre&s;s. Several officers, to my certain knowledge, and &s;ome of high rank, in the beginning of the year 1776, expre&s;&s;ed their ap|prehen&s;ions of independency, and po&s;itively averred that
<Q>if the Congre&s;s, declared for independency, they would not only abandon them, but turn their &s;words again&s;t them.</Q>
Yet when independency was declared that &s;ame year, the&s;e officers &s;till adhered to the Congre&s;s! They thought it would be a <HI>breach of honour</HI> to de&s;ert the Congre&s;s, and the cau&s;e in which they had engaged! This was al&s;o the ca&s;e of others.</P>
<P>There are many abu&s;es of the word <HI>honour</HI>; but this is the mo&s;t flagrant abu&s;e of it that I have met with.

<Q>that the&s;e men were &s;o deeply en|gaged on the &s;ide of the Congre&s;s, that they knew not how to di&s;entangle them&s;elves:</Q>
I an&s;wer, that this plea may as well be urged for a continuance in any crime or vice&mdash;in any mea&s;ures, however iniqui|tous. To err is the lot of humanity; but when a man is convinced of his error, honour and duty require that he &s;hould retract it; nor can the plea of his being deeply involved, be any excu&s;e, or extenua|tion of his guilt. In the common affairs of life this a&s;&s;uredly is the ca&s;e; I &s;ee no difference in the in&s;tance before us.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be alledged further, as it probably will,
<Q>that the&s;e men had changed their &s;entiments, and thought independency would be beneficial to this country;</Q>
I am willing to join i&s;&s;ue on this ground, and examine the truth of this plea.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then that the independency of America could be e&s;tabli&s;hed, this mu&s;t be done by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of your French alliance, as is acknowledged on all hands. Do you really imagine that the liber|ties of America, or the prote&s;tant religion would not be thereby endangered? If you think &s;o, you mu&s;t be utter &s;trangers to the genius of popery, to the ambitious, enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of that in&s;idious monarchy.</P>

<Q>that the United States may not of right, nor will, con|clude either truce or peace with the common enemy, without the formal con&s;ent of their ally fir&s;t obtain|ed.</Q>
So that you and your brethren mu&s;t continue butchering each other, till it &s;uits the intere&s;t and policy of France to bid you &s;top. If the colonies are &s;o much at the devotion and beck of France now, what will the ca&s;e be when they are &s;till weaker and more exhau&s;ted than they are at pre&s;ent; and when they are involved deeper with France, and are much more in her power? The&s;e things carry terror with them, when the a&s;piring views of France are con&s;idered&mdash;her aim at univer&s;al monarchy, and her repeated encroachments on the rights of every neigh|bouring &s;tate for accompli&s;hing that de&s;ign. The per&s;on who is acquainted with the&s;e matters, and yet is not apprehen&s;ive for the liberties of this coun|try, is either regardle&s;s of tho&s;e liberties, or he &s;huts his eyes again&s;t the cleare&s;t conviction.</P>
<P>The French alliance looks with no le&s;s malignant an a&s;pect on the Prote&s;tant religion, than on the li|berties of America. Sad experience had taught our ance&s;tors, that &s;evere laws and penalties, and the vi|gilance

The&s;e laws were extended to the colonies.</P>
<P>But under the Congre&s;s this procedure is rever&s;ed. In&s;tead of laws to re&s;train, the door is thrown wide open to receive popery. Its prie&s;ts are favoured and countenanced&mdash;they meet with every encourage|ment; whil&s;t prote&s;tant clergymen, who will not <HI>perjure</HI> them&s;elves to &s;upport the Congre&s;s, are ba|ni&s;hed, impri&s;oned, and otherwi&s;e cruelly per&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>Is popery then changed? Is it purged from error and become le&s;s per&s;ecuting? No&mdash;it is now the very &s;ame as formerly.

Not one erroneous or &s;uper&s;titious article has been yet expunged from its creed&mdash;nor hath any reformation taken place in its idolatrous wor&s;hip. Its prie&s;ts are as zealous as ever to make pro&s;elytes, and to impo&s;e their &s;piritual tyranny on mankind.</P>

<P>To &s;peak again&s;t popery, which is the religion of France, would draw as &s;evere per&s;ecution from ma|ny of the mo&s;t zealous abettors of Congre&s;s, as to &s;peak again&s;t the Congre&s;s it&s;elf. They will not permit a word to be &s;aid to the di&s;advantage of po|pery, In very many di&s;tricts of the continent&mdash; and in &s;ome of New-England&mdash;where popery was formerly dete&s;ted, and &s;carcely a papi&s;t was to be &s;een, numbers of popi&s;h books are now di&s;per&s;ed, and read with avidity I could name a member of the rebel council in one of the New-England colonies, who was formerly con&s;idered as a zealous prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enter, who not long &s;ince harrangued a large a&s;|&s;embly of people on &s;ome of the di&s;puted points be|tween prote&s;tants and papi&s;ts; &s;uch as the invocation of &s;aint, purgatory, tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, &amp;c.

The rea&s;on why <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters</HI> were named in the above anecdotes, was to place the amazing change of people's &s;entiments in favor of popery, a con&s;equence of the French alliance, in a more &s;triking point of light; for Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters were &s;uppo&s;ed formerly to be more aver&s;e from popery than other prote&s;tants. Why then &s;hould not the truth be &s;poken? Can it injure the vir|tuous? Or &s;hould it be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed to &s;creen the guilty? The true di&s;tinction at pre&s;ent, and the only one I make, is, that of loyali&s;t, a friend to the King and con&s;titution; and that of rebel, a friend to independency and a French faction.

<P>That a very large majority of the American <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> have zealou&s;ly concurred in promoting this rebellion, is a fact &s;o notorious, that it cannot be denied.

It &s;hould al&s;o be remembered, that pre&s;by|terians in Scotland have been among&s;t the mo&s;t loyal of the King's &s;ubjects on this occa&s;ion.

<P>Now mark how differently it is treated within the King's lines. This will clearly appear from the following fact: In February, 1778, a large French &s;hip of force was taken near Che&s;apeak Bay. The Rev. Mr. <HI>De La Motte,</HI> a regular prie&s;t, of the or|der of St. Augu&s;tin, was her Chaplain. The prize was brought to New-York; and Mr. <HI>De La Motte,</HI> with the other officers were permitted to go about, having given their parole of honour. <HI>De La Motte</HI> was &s;olicited to &s;ay Ma&s;s; but being apprized that a law of this Province prohibited the exerci&s;e of the Popi&s;h religion within its limits, he a&s;ked the Com|mandant's permi&s;&s;ion for the purpo&s;e.

which has been huddled up in the mid&s;t of war and tumults, is &s;uch, that it is nece&s;&s;arily &s;ub|ver&s;ive of liberty, and mu&s;t lead to tyranny.</P>
<P>Liberty cannot exi&s;t for any time, where the &s;upreme power of a &s;tate is not divided. A right di&s;tribution of that power is the &s;pring of liberty; in this al&s;o con&s;i&s;ts the excellency of any civil con&s;titution. Am|bition and a thir&s;t of power are naturally inherent in man. The&s;e will &s;timulate bodies of men, as well as individuals to encroach on the rights of others. Un|le&s;s there is &s;ome power to re&s;train tho&s;e encroach|ments, liberty mu&s;t vani&s;h.</P>
<P>In Britain, the con&s;titution has guarded again&s;t &s;uch encroachments. The &s;upreme power is divided into three branches; each of which can check and control the others, when nece&s;&s;ary. If any one of them &s;hould attempt to pa&s;s its proper limits, to the injury of the others, or of the community, the other branches can interfere immediately, and fru&s;trate its de&s;igns before they can to executed. Hence ari&s;e the permanence and &s;tability of Briti&s;h liberty.</P>
<P>In America, the ca&s;e is wholly different. The Congre&s;s have found means to unite and centre in them&s;elves the power of King, Lords and Commons. They are ab&s;olute, paramount and unre&s;trained&mdash; without check or controul. They may pa&s;s what laws, or take what mea&s;ures they plea&s;e, and there is nothing to re&s;train them. They may &s;ell you and your liberties, with the &s;oil of America to the high|e&s;t bidder, and you have no remedy.</P>
<P>Have you not already experienced in part what is here alledged? Do you approve of all the proceedings of the Congre&s;s? And if not, what remedy can you
<PB N="121" REF="016311_0124_0F9C2084CE144750">
apply? I do not a&s;k you whether you have <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> approved; but did a <HI>majority</HI> approve of the Congre&s;s's declaration of independency&mdash;Of their withholding from you the propo&s;als made by the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;i|oners &s;oon after&mdash;Of their rejecting the offers of ac|commodation by the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners lately, without di&s;cu&s;&s;ion or examination&mdash;Of their alliance with France, and their re&s;olve of Jan. 14, by which this country was virtually, and as for as they could betrayed to that in&s;idious power&mdash;Of their &s;ecreting from you their mo&s;t important tran&s;actions&mdash;Of their emitting &s;uch enormous &s;ums of paper currency, by which you are brought to the brink of ruin&mdash;Of their burthening America with &s;uch a debt, by this currency and their traffic with France, as mu&s;t impoveri&s;h and depre&s;s this country for generations to come? How|ever you may di&s;approve of any, or all of the&s;e, yet it is pa&s;t your power to redre&s;s them.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be urged&mdash;
<Q>that the members of the Congre&s;s are elected by the people&mdash;that their fears become vacant after a &s;hort term; and that this is a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for the liberties of America.</Q>
I an&s;wer, it is by no means a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity. When the members of the congre&s;s are once elected, they become inve&s;ted with ab&s;olute unre&s;trained pow|er. There is nothing to check their proceedings. In one &s;e&s;&s;ion the liberties of America may be laid pro&s;trate; and when an act or acts are pa&s;&s;ed, how|ever pernicious, they cannot be recalled. The thing is done, and is therefore remidile&s;s, as to you. Can the va&s;&s;als of Turkey be in a wor&s;e &s;ituation?</P>
<P><Q>But mu&s;t not they participate in your burdens, and be equally involved in your lo&s;s of liberty, and other evils?</Q>
&mdash;Yes, verily &mdash;ju&s;t as the thirty tyrants of Athens, Julius Cae&s;ar, and Oliver Crom|well,
<PB N="122" REF="016311_0125_0F9C208590197D90">
with their re&s;pective a&s;&s;ociates, participated in the burdens of their countrymen, and were involved in the common evils. Experience &s;hews that con&s;i|derations of this &s;ort will not prevent the abu&s;e of power. You cannot be more zealous for a Repub|lican Government, nor more aver&s;e to the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m, than the Athenians, Romans, and En|gli&s;h were, at the periods abovementioned: Yet they were compelled re&s;pectively to &s;ubmit to that yoke. The emoluments of office would more than com|pen&s;ate for the pecuniary part of the burden; and ambition will &s;tick at nothing to gra&s;p its favourite object&mdash;domination.</P>
<P>Be not deceived therefore, my countrymen, with the &s;ound of names; nor think there is any nece&s;&s;a|ry connection between liberty and a Congre&s;s. You may be en&s;laved by a Congre&s;s as &s;oon as by a Mo|narch&mdash;much &s;ooner than by a limited monarch.</P>
<P>The American Congre&s;s have ordered matters &s;o that they are ve&s;ted with ab&s;olute power&mdash;they can turn the collective &s;trength of the community again&s;t any individual, or to any object they plea&s;e: Yet, as a body, they are re&s;pon&s;ible to none, there is no|thing to check them, none who can call them to an account. No man therefore, who wi&s;hes well to America, but mu&s;t tremble at the apprehen&s;ions of &s;uch a power. To live under it is nothing but an expre&s;&s;ion denoting &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>Independency is pregnant with many other evils. To &s;upport the civil, naval and military e&s;tabli&s;h|ments of this new empire, would require nearly <HI>four Millions of Pounds Sterling,</HI> annually in time of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="016311_0126_0F9C208660542F20">This, with the debts already contracted by the Congre&s;s, and the &s;inking their paper currency, would &s;ubject you to heavier taxes than are paid by any people in chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of animo&s;ity and di&s;cord, of deadly feuds and bloody conte&s;ts, are already &s;own&mdash;the &s;pirit which will cheri&s;h the&s;e, and bring them to full maturity, even now begins to work. Scarcely can the terror of the Briti&s;h arms, joined to the au|thority of the Congre&s;s, re&s;train &s;ome provinces from ho&s;tility and war about their mutual claims to certain di&s;tricts&mdash;and &s;ome of tho&s;e di&s;tricts de&s;o|lated by the Savages. In&s;tigated by the &s;ame am|bition which led them to throw off their connection with the parent &s;tate, a few provinces lay claim to the whole of the we&s;tern un&s;ettled lands, to the ex|clu&s;ion of the re&s;t. It is manife&s;t that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o immen&s;e a territory, would, in time, enable tho&s;e provinces to &s;ubjugate the others, and &s;wallow them up. Religious prejudices would certainly ope|rate, and &s;truggles for &s;uperiority would en&s;ue; for whatever may be the opinion of &s;ome to the con|trary, it is ab&s;olutely certain, that on the part of many, the pre&s;ent is a <HI>Religious War.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e cla&s;hing intere&s;ts, prejudices and princi|ple, which are at this hour fermenting, would bur&s;t out with de&s;tructive violence the moment that the claims and &s;uperintendence of Britain are entirely removed. Perhaps you are not apprehen&s;ive that tho&s;e evils would follow; neither were you appre|hen&s;ive of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> evils when the conte&s;t began. But the&s;e con&s;equences would infallibly attend your independency at this time. All tho&s;e circum|&s;tances by which this country flouri&s;hed, would be changed; its &s;tate and condition mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be changed al&s;o. What were the circum&s;tances that promoted our growth and oppulence?&mdash;The pro|tection of Briti&s;h, the mildne&s;s of our government,
<PB N="124" REF="016311_0127_0F9C2087A08CCB50">
an exemption from taxes, the influx of Europeans, and a &s;pirit of peaceful indu&s;try. Each of the&s;e, in ca&s;e of independency, would indubitably be rever&s;ed; mu&s;t not the benefits ari&s;ing from them be al&s;o re|ver&s;ed? America would be a &s;cene of bloody di&s;cord and de&s;olation for ages&mdash;the mo&s;t mi&s;erable di&s;tract|ed country on earth. In this wretched &s;tate it would continue, 'till a few provinces, or one &s;ect had &s;ub|jugated the re&s;t; as this would probably end in the depoti&s;m of <HI>one</HI> per&s;on. Such has been the uniform cour&s;e of human affairs on &s;imilar occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Let me add, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for &s;o exten&s;ive a country as America to remain under a republican form of government&mdash;the form now adopted. The experience of mankind, as far as we have any re|cords, clearly evinceth this; as well as the conditi|on of human nature. We can no more change the laws of nature in this re&s;pect, than in any other&mdash; no more than we can change the laws of gravity, or tho&s;e which guide the &s;ea&s;ons, or regulate the uni|ver&s;e. The republican form may do well enough for a &s;ingle city, or &s;uch a little &s;pot as Holland, Ve|nice or the Swi&s;s Cantons, but is utterly un&s;uitable to &s;uch a wide extended continent as this; nor does hi&s;tory afford one in&s;tance of the kind. No &s;ooner had the &s;pirit of conque&s;t enlarged the Roman em|pire beyond the limits which were adapted to their republican government&mdash;and tho&s;e limits not a <HI>fifth</HI> part as large as North-America&mdash;than the de&s;poti&s;m of one per&s;on was the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Such is the pro&s;pect, my countrymen, which in|dependency pre&s;ents to you. I tru&s;t you will give the&s;e matters a &s;erious, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate examination, and weigh them with that attention which their impor|tance demands. All that is dear or valuable to man on earth is now at &s;take with you&mdash;all that can make life de&s;irable is &s;u&s;pended on the deci&s;ion of this conte&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="016311_0128_0F9C2087CC983288">Nothing but the power and interpo&s;ition of Britain &s;tands between you and the evils which I have now mentioned. Were &s;he to break off her connection, tho&s;e evils would ru&s;h in upon you like a torrent; nor could &s;he take a &s;everer revenge for the injuries and in&s;ults &s;he hath received, than leaving you to your&s;elves. Of all this, I know many of you are fully &s;en&s;ible; yet delu&s;ion &s;till holds you in her fa&s;cinating chains.</P>
<P>I have hitherto rea&s;oned with you on the above &s;uppo&s;itions, purely to meet your prejudices, examine the validity of your &s;everal pleas, and the grounds of your expectations re&s;pecting independency. But I mu&s;t now tell you plainly that independency is UN|ATTAINABLE. Britain is <HI>determined</HI> to a&s;&s;ert her ju&s;t claim to her American colonies, and &s;he is able to carry her determination and claim into execution. Happy is it for you that &s;he hath ability and will to do &s;o; this alone can re&s;cue America from the foreign and dome&s;tic evils we have been con&s;idering.</P>
<P>France cannot protect her own trade, or &s;ettle|ments; how then can &s;he protect or a&s;&s;i&s;t you? Or, were &s;he able, would &s;he be&s;tow that freedom and liberty on you, which &s;he cruelly denies to her own children? Do you expect that Spain will a&s;&s;i&s;t to e&s;tabli&s;h your independency? Were &s;he even to do &s;o, contrary to every principle or national intere&s;t and good policy, (of which however there is not the lea&s;t probability) be a&s;&s;ured there are other Europe|an powers ready to interfere, and a&s;&s;i&s;t Britain; and the&s;e would more than balance the weight of Spain. Do you flatter your&s;elves that becau&s;e the war has been &s;o much prolonged, you have a chance yet to &s;ucceed? Reflect, I be&s;eech you, that Britain is &s;low in her operations at the beginning of every war, and often un&s;ucce&s;sful. The freedom of her con&s;titution &s;ubjects her to this inconvenience, and occa&s;ions embarra&s;&s;ments that are unknown to arbitrary go|vernments.
<PB N="126" REF="016311_0129_0F9C208ACBF032B8">
You remember the la&s;t war. You may recollect what lo&s;&s;es &s;he &s;u&s;tained; how gloomy the pro&s;pect of America was; that it was threaten|ed with the yoke of France, for <HI>four years</HI> after the war began: Yet Britain finally triumphed over France and Spain, not only here, but in every quarter of the globe. That Freedom, from which embarra&s;&s;ments ari&s;e at fir&s;t, enables her, when tho|roughly rou&s;ed, to exert a vigour which the da&s;tard &s;ons of &s;ervitude can neither attain nor with&s;tand.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the numbers of your brethren that have been already &s;wept off&mdash;the de&s;olation and mi&s;ery that over&s;pread this country. Do you think the &s;word hath not yet devoured enough? Or &s;hould the ravages of war be invited to hold on their dreadful career, and con&s;ume whatever yet remains? That the Congre&s;s mean to continue tho&s;e ravages, is evident. Sooner than part with their honours, emoluments and power, the &s;weets of which they have now ta&s;ted, they will &s;acrifice the life of every individual who will be &s;tupid enough to &s;upport or adhere to them.</P>
<P>What can attach you to men who have &s;hewn &s;uch a di&s;regard to your welfare&mdash;&s;uch in&s;en&s;ibility to your mi&s;eries? Who, contrary to all rational hope of &s;uc|ce&s;s, perpetuate your calamities; and although utter|ly unable to protect you, yet drive you out to be &s;laughtered? And who by their duplicity and cruel|ty have di&s;graced America!</P>
<P>So void of humanity are the Congre&s;s towards you, that altho' they compel you to be enrolled as militia, and this &s;ubjects you to all the penalties of rebellion; yet they will not redeem you from captivity, nor ex|change you, unle&s;s you happen to be taken on actual &s;ervice; and great numbers, as you very well know, are taken who are not thus on &s;ervice. They oblige you to take arms again&s;t your rightful Sovereign; yet you mu&s;t expect no relief from them when
<PB N="127" REF="016311_0130_0F9C208C123F2C50">
&s;uffering for that crime, although they can ea&s;ily afford relief. If taken, you may langui&s;h and rot in pri&s;on, or die, and your families &s;uffer; but they neither care for you, not yours.</P>
<P>Even their Continental troops fare no better.&mdash; Many hundreds of them, officers and men, are now confined in this place, &s;ome of whom were made pri&s;oners as early as 1776; be&s;ides multitudes that have died. Whatever fal&s;hoods you may have heard concerning tho&s;e pri&s;oners, be a&s;&s;ured they have had to the full the u&s;ual allowance of provi&s;ions for pri|&s;oners, and have been as well u&s;ed otherwi&s;e as the &s;tate of things would admit. They were confined in large buildings, or on board of &s;hips; nor could they be otherwi&s;e accommodated unle&s;s thay had been &s;ent off the continent. The Officers were permitted to go at large on their parole, although upwards of an <HI>hundred</HI> of them have &s;hamefully violated that parole and ran off.</P>
<P>Why have tho&s;e unhappy men been thus brutally abandoned? Not content with neglecting their zealous partizans, the Congre&s;s have added in&s;ult and mockery to cruelty. They have &s;everal times appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to meet others from the Briti&s;h Commander in Chief, to treat of an ex|change of pri&s;oners. Yet in truth they meant to do nothing but trifle with us, to amu&s;e and deceive you and the rebel pri&s;oners. A de&s;ire of exchange was pretended; yet the exchange was evaded, not only by a breach of public faith, by propo&s;als utterly inadmi&s;&s;ible, but by a &s;eries of chicane and duplici|ty which would be held in dete&s;tation by men of any honour or principle. They undervalued you on tho&s;e occa&s;ions; alledging, that <HI>one of their men was not worth a Briti&s;h or German &s;oldier&mdash;that it would be prejudicial to them to part with the remains of Bur|goyne's army on equal terms</HI>; as if Britain could not ea&s;ily replace two or three thou&s;and men; and the
<PB N="128" REF="016311_0131_0F9C208D60727908">
pri&s;oners of that army in their hands do not exceed that number! In their late <HI>Addre&s;s,</HI> the Congre&s;s have more than in&s;inuated that the American merchants, farmers, and the inferior officers employed in their Service, are a Set of mercenary wretches, who care nothing for the public if they can only enrich them|&s;elves: In their procedure re&s;pecting pri&s;oners, they have declared by words and actions, that you are not worth exchanging, and are beneath their regard or notice.</P>
<P>The true and &s;ecret &s;pring of this conduct is as di&s;honourable to Congre&s;s, as it is injurious and provoking to you. The real fact &s;tands thus&mdash; While the Congre&s;s have tho&s;e pri&s;oners, they are &s;ure that a great number of Engli&s;h guineas mu&s;t be &s;ent for their &s;upport&mdash;they are no le&s;s &s;ure that many or mo&s;t of the&s;e will infallibly find their way to them&s;elves; and however they may extricate his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, they like very well to view his <HI>picture in gold.</HI> Hereby they can make provi&s;ion for them&s;elves again&s;t an evil day in &s;ome foreign coun|try, which their own currency will not do. Be&s;ides, by detaining tho&s;e pri&s;oners, the Congre&s;s imagine they have pledges of &s;ecurity for their own <HI>precious</HI> per&s;ons in ca&s;e of a di&s;a&s;trous i&s;&s;ue in their affairs, or that any of them&s;elves &s;hould be made pri&s;oners.&mdash; The&s;e are the <HI>laudable</HI> motives which induce the con|gre&s;s to neglect their friends, leave them to &s;truggle with all the hard&s;hips of confinement, and their families to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>For my part, I &s;hould not be &s;urprized if all the rebel pri&s;oners, tho&s;e we now have, or &s;uch as may hereafter be taken, were &s;ent to &s;ome di&s;tant coun|try. Here, they put government to a great expence, without any advantage whatever, as the Congre&s;s will not exchange them. The poor wretches are a burden to them&s;elves, and u&s;ele&s;s to mankind. By &s;ending them off, they might be di&s;po&s;ed of &s;o as to be &s;erviceable to them&s;elves and others. Good po|licy,

in my opinion, dictates &s;uch a mea&s;ure; and I am &s;ure humanity mu&s;t approve of it.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould I enlarge further? The time would fail me to recount the &s;everal enormities of tho&s;e men, who &s;eem to be intended only as a &s;courge for this devoted country. Con&s;ult your own feel|ings, your memory and experience: What have you known but violence, oppre&s;&s;ion and mi&s;ery &s;ince the reign of the Congre&s;s commenced? What have you in pro&s;pect, if you adhere to them, but de&s;truction and ruin? Why then adhere longer to men, whom duty, honour, patrioti&s;m and &s;elf pre&s;ervation call loudly on you to abandon? Who&s;e tyrannical &s;y&s;tem you &s;hould exert your&s;elves to overthrow?</P>
<P>Turn your Eyes, my countrymen, to Britain, your parent &s;tate&mdash;the &s;tate from which you origin|ated&mdash;which protected and fo&s;tered you with tender care, and rai&s;ed you to your late flouri&s;hing and en|vied condition. She holds out to you the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, freedom and &s;ecurity&mdash;an exemption from the evils which now threaten you.</P>
<P>Were the Americans left to their unre&s;trained choice, Britain is the country, and the <HI>only</HI> one, with which they &s;hould de&s;ire an union. Her con&s;titution in&s;ures real, &s;ub&s;tantial liberty to every &s;ubject&mdash;all are under the protection of equal laws&mdash;none are expo&s;ed to the caprice of arbitrary will&mdash;the proper|ty and per&s;on, the civil and religious liberties of every man are perfectly &s;ecure. Britain is the only &s;tate who&s;e maritime power can effectually protect Ame|rica from foreign in&s;ult or inva&s;ion&mdash;&s;he is the only &s;tate who&s;e immen&s;e trade can employ and give vent to the various commodities of this we&s;tern hemi&s;phere to advantage&mdash;and &s;he is the only &s;tate who can fully and on advantageous terms, &s;upply America with the &s;e|veral manufactures of linen, woollen, metals, &amp;c. that &s;he requires. No other &s;tate can furni&s;h the&s;e of equal quality, in the &s;ame quantity and at the &s;ame price. Let me add, that the ties of blood, religion, lan|guage,
<PB N="130" REF="016311_0133_0F9C208E94EE0458">
laws and manners, &s;trongly impel each to a coalition, which cannot be &s;aid of any other &s;tate, with re&s;pect to America, but Britain. Providence, nature and rea&s;on, therefore point out and demand this union&mdash;and that union, I firmly believe and tru&s;t in God, <HI>will</HI> take place.</P>
<P>Yes&mdash;I &s;ee the au&s;picious aera near approaching, when Britain and America will be united&mdash;when a generous con&s;titution, guarding again&s;t former incon|veniences, will be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and from which Con|gre&s;&s;ional and Gallic de&s;poti&s;m will be banni&s;hed&mdash; when both countries, &s;upporting and &s;upported by each other, will ri&s;e to eminence, pro&s;perity and &s;trength, unknown to pa&s;t ages, bid defiance to fo|reign and dome&s;tic enemies, and become the admi|ration and envy of mankind.</P>
<P>This is no flight of fancy, un&s;upported by rea&s;on. It is not like the dreams of independency, which mu&s;t vani&s;h like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion. Each of the&s;e particulars, is founded in truth, in the actual &s;tate of things at pre&s;ent; nor have I a doubt but each will be realized. Neither France nor the Con|gre&s;s can wre&s;t tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings from us, nor rever&s;e the cour&s;e of nature. Whil&s;t this pro&s;pect &s;hould animate the friends of government, liberty and peace; it &s;hould al&s;o engage <HI>all</HI> to unite and exert them&s;elves in arre&s;ting the ravages of war, and checking the pro|gre&s;s of de&s;olation. The &s;ooner this is done, the bet|ter. Your part therefore is, to contribute what you can to &s;hake off &s;peedily the yoke of republican ty|ranny, and re-unite your&s;elves to the parent &s;tate, from which republican ambition, phrenzy and delu|&s;ion have &s;evered you.</P>
