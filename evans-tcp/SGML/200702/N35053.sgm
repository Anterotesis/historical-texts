<HEAD>A Narrative, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE depravity of the human mind is &s;o univer&s;ally acknowledged in the pre&s;|ent enlightened age, and a belief of the uni|ver&s;al pre&s;idency of providence over the af|fairs of men &s;o evidently e&s;tabli&s;hed, as to need no argument to enforce the reception of a narrative in which both are peculiarly manife&s;t.</P>
<P>Convinced of the truth of the above <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">|ment I &s;hall proceed in my narrative, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">|voring on the one hand to avoid tedious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|petitions, and on the other to omit no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">|dent that may afford entertainment to my courteous reader.</P>
<P>My father dying when I was young, my mother put me apprentice to learn the trace or occupation of a carpenter. On the other &s;ide of the road, oppo&s;ite to the hou&s;e where I lived there dwelt a tailor, who had an ap|prentice named <HI>William White,</HI> with whom I was very intimate, during the time of his apprentice&s;hip, but he was out of his time and went to &s;ea &s;ome time before I was free, being about three years older than my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>White, as I before ob&s;erved, went to &s;ea &s;ometime before I was free, but he did not return, nor do I remember that I ever &s;aw or
<PB N="4" REF="045870_0004_10207588B9BCB360">
heard of him afterwards, till I found him among the pirates.</P>
<P>From my youth I had an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;ti|ble de&s;ire for undertaking a voyage to &s;ea, which I re&s;olved at all events to gratify, as &s;oon as I obtained a right to di&s;po&s;e of my|&s;elf. In e&s;tabli&s;hing this re&s;olution, a love of novelty, joined to a &s;ecret delight I en|joyed in hearing &s;ailors relate the curio&s;ities they met with in their voyages, doubtle&s;s had a great effect, and the older I grew the impre&s;&s;ion became the &s;tronger.</P>
<P>But however &s;trong my de&s;ire was to fol|low the &s;ea, a &s;en&s;e of the duty I owed my &s;urviving parent, &s;o far overballanced my inclination, as to occa&s;ion me to form a de|termination not to gratify it untill I &s;hould be of age, unle&s;s I could gain her con&s;ent. The propen&s;ity however was &s;o &s;trong as to induce me at the age of &s;eventeen, to apply to my mother and reque&s;t liberty to go <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> voyage to &s;ea. My mother was very unea&s;y at the reque&s;t, and u&s;ed every art of per&s;ua|&s;ion that maternal tenderne&s;s could dictate, to induce me to relinqui&s;h the de&s;ign. Ex|pre&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e that I &s;hould entertain any idea of following the &s;ea, as it was a life mo&s;t evidently attended with innumerable fa|tigues and dangers: urging, as a particular rea&s;on for her di&s;approbation of the mea&s;ure, the melancholly fate of my father, who be|ing a &s;eafaring man, was taken by a French
<PB N="5" REF="045870_0005_1020758A450677F0">
frigate, on a voyage homeward bound, and carried into Martinico, a number of years before, where he underwent all the hard&s;hips of a clo&s;e and cruel confinement, and altho' ultimately redeemed, with many others, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be mo&s;t inhumanly poi&s;oned by the French, on board the cartel, as they prin|cipally died on their pa&s;&s;age home.</P>
<P>However &s;trong an argument this might have appeared to my mother it failed of its de&s;ired effect upon me, it only lulled my de&s;ire for a while, but by no means eradica|ted it: I waited however with a great de|gree of impatience about two years longer, when I again a&s;ked leave to go a voyage to the We&s;tindies, and my mother finding my re&s;o|lution unabated, concluded &s;he could as well part with me then as when I became of age, after which &s;he imagined &s;he &s;hould not be able to detain me. Upon the whole &s;he told me &s;he was unwilling I &s;hould go to the We&s;tindies, but that the &s;loop Dolphin, capt. Ha&s;kell was then in the harbor, fit|ting out for a fi&s;hing voyage, and if I would go with him &s;he would give her con&s;ent; to this propo&s;al I readily a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>I accordingly &s;hipped on board the &s;loop, and had a tolerable pa&s;&s;age to the fi&s;hing ground; but &s;oon after our arrival there, we were &s;urprized by the appearance of a &s;hip, which from external &s;igns we &s;u&s;pected to be a pirate. We were not by any means pre|pared
<PB N="6" REF="045870_0006_1020758D190C2F88">
to oppo&s;e &s;o formidable an enemy, and &s;he was &s;o clo&s;e upon us before we &s;u&s;|pected her as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for us to e&s;cape by running away, we were there|fore obliged to abide our fate peaceably let the con&s;equence be what it would.</P>
<P>The pirate &s;oon came up and &s;ent a boat on board our &s;loop, demanding who we were, and where we were bound; to which our captain gave a direct an&s;wer. By this boat's crew we learned, that the noted pirate capt. Phillips commanded their &s;hip. This intel|ligence it will readily be conceived, gave us great unea&s;ine&s;s, mo&s;t of our crew being quite young, and having often heard of the cruelties committed by that execrable pi|rate, which made us dread to fall into his hands.</P>
<P>The pirate's boat &s;oon boarded us again, demanding the name of every hand on board: In this boat came <HI>White</HI> the tailor, with whom I had been acquainted during his apprentice&s;hip, as beforementioned. I was greatly &s;urprized to find him employed in &s;o criminal a cour&s;e of life, though I &s;aid nothing of the matter to him. On the re|turn of the pirate's boat with a li&s;t of our names, White, as I was afterwards inform|ed, acquainted Philips of his knowledge of me, informing him, that if he could engage me in his &s;ervice, he would gain a good &s;tout re&s;olute fellow, every way he &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;uch a hand as he wanted.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="045870_0007_102075918647C5D8">
On receiving this information, as he &s;tood in need of a hand, and found we had no property he wanted on board, he &s;ent his boat once more with orders to capt. Ha&s;kell, to &s;end me on board his &s;hip and the re&s;t of the crew with the &s;loop, may go free. My worthy commander, with much vi&s;ible con|cern in his countenance, took me a&s;ide, and informed me of Phillips's orders, adding, that although it would be exceedingly di&s;a|greeable and painful to him to let me go, yet as we were entirely in the power of a bloody mercile&s;s ruffian, and no hopes of e&s;cape but by giving me up, I believe, &s;ays he, you mu&s;t go and try your fortune with them.</P>
<P>The thought of being &s;acrificed as it were to procure liberty for the re&s;t of the crew, opperated greatly upon my &s;pirits, and the fir&s;t conclu&s;ion I drew up was, that I would not on any conditions agree to go on board the pirate. I therefore told my captain that I had ever been faithful to his intere&s;t and commands, that I had always wi&s;hed to do my duty punctually and well, but that I was determined not to go on board the pirate let the con&s;equence be what it would. Our conver&s;ation ended here, for that time, and the boat returned without me.</P>
<P>Phillips was greatly incen&s;ed when the boat returned without me, and &s;ent again, with orders to bring me either dead or alive. My capt. took me a&s;ide again, and told me the
<PB N="8" REF="045870_0008_10207594591ED110">
pirate's re&s;olution and me&s;&s;age, adding that he believed I &s;hould do well to go with them, for if I refu&s;ed to go, and made re&s;i&s;tance, it would be inevitable death to me, and proba|bly to our whole crew: He urged further, that my &s;ubmitting would prove the certain relea&s;e of the re&s;t of the crew, and there would at lea&s;t be a probability of my making an e&s;cape from them at &s;ometime or other: But if I could not find a way to e&s;cape, it was not impo&s;&s;ible but Phillips might di&s;|charge me, for he had &s;ent word that if I would agree to &s;erve him faithfully for two months, he would then &s;et me at liberty.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e only who have been in &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tances can form an adequate idea of the di&s;tre&s;s I experienced at this time. If I ob|&s;tinately refu&s;ed to join the pirates, in&s;tant death &s;tared me and my comrades in the face, if I con&s;ented to go with them I expected to be ma&s;&s;acred for refu&s;ing to &s;ign their pirat|ical articles, which I had fully determined never to do, though I &s;hould be put to the extremity of torture for refu&s;al. Into &s;o critical a &s;ituation had my bad fortune plun|ged me, that inevitable de&s;truction &s;eemed to &s;tare me in the face from every quarter.</P>
<P>I took the matter however into &s;erious con&s;ideration, and after the mo&s;t mature de|liberation, determined, to venture my&s;elf a|mong them, rather than bring the vengeance of the pirates on my comrades; I therefore
<PB N="9" REF="045870_0009_1020759725E40AF0">
went with them, &s;eemingly contented, and the capt. renewing his promi&s;e to &s;et me at liberty in two months, I engaged to &s;erve him to the be&s;t of my abilities during <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> term. I was likewi&s;e agreeably di&s;appointed in their not urging &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly as I expected the thing I mo&s;t of all dreaded, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the &s;igning of their articles. To induce me to join them they u&s;ed more arguments of a per&s;ua&s;ive than a compul&s;ory nature, judging I &s;uppo&s;e, that youth would be more ea&s;ily enticed than compelled to join in &s;haring their ill-gotten gain.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t went aboard of the pirate their crew con&s;i&s;ted of ten men, including their captain, and the whole of them I think, as &s;tout, daring, hardy looking fellows as ev|er I &s;aw together. As I was then the only hand aboard who had not &s;ub&s;cribed their articles, the capt. a&s;&s;igned me to the helm, where I kept my &s;tation during the greate&s;t part of the time I &s;tayed with them.</P>
<P>No captures of any con&s;equence were made during the fir&s;t two months: Some &s;mall ve&s;&s;els were taken, but their lading was too incon&s;iderable to &s;atisfy the in&s;atia|ble di&s;po&s;ition of the pirates.</P>
<P>The period being now arrived, when I had a right, according to agreement, to demand my liberty, I thought it a proper &s;ea&s;on at lea&s;t to remind the capt. of the manumi&s;&s;ion he had engaged me. For this purpo&s;e I
<PB N="10" REF="045870_0010_10207598AE518370">
went to him, and in language the lea&s;t offen|&s;ive I could frame, reminded him of his promi&s;e, and reque&s;ted him to fulfil it. Phil|lips in tollerable good humour, replied, that we had done but little bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ince I came aboard; that he could not well &s;pare me yet, but if I would &s;tay with him three months longer, he would then &s;et me at liberty UPON HIS HONOR, and I was obliged quietly to &s;ubmit, comply with his demands, and tru&s;t to his honor, though it turned out in the end that it did but mock me.</P>
<P>Nothing of any importance occurred dur|ing this three months. Some few &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els were taken and plundered; their car|goes were of no great value and their hands were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with their ve&s;&s;els, except two or three robu&s;t, &s;tout looking men whom Phillips picked from among them and com|pelled to &s;ign his articles.</P>
<P>When the three months were expired, I went to the capt. and once more reminded him of the expiration of my &s;ervitude, and hand&s;omely reque&s;ted him to &s;et me a&s;hore according to his promi&s;e, that I might go to my mother, who had not heard from me &s;ince my fir&s;t capt. returned from his fi&s;hing voyage.</P>
<P>Set you at liberty, damn you; you &s;hall be &s;et at liberty when I damn'd and not be|fore replied Phillips; in a rage more compa|rible with the diabolical di&s;po&s;ition of an in|fernal
<PB N="11" REF="045870_0011_1020759A40A540B0">
fiend than a being endowed with a ra|tional &s;oul, &s;u&s;ceptible of human &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>It is evident, and experience daily evinces, that per&s;ons, by habituating them&s;elves to any particular vice, become &s;o familiarized thereto, as to be unable to di&s;tingui&s;h it from a real virtue; and in &s;uch ca&s;e con|&s;cience cea&s;es to alarm the under&s;tanding and &s;uffers the culprit to pur&s;ue it to its ex|tremity. This was undoubtedly the ca&s;e with capt. Phillips, who was not addicted to one particular vice, but to every vice.</P>
<P>Having now lo&s;t all hope and probability of being liberated, there was no alternative more eligible for me than to &s;u&s;tain my &s;er|vitude with as much patience, re&s;olution and fortitude as po&s;&s;ible. Although the capt. had a&s;&s;erted that I &s;hould not be &s;et at liber|ty till he was damned, I was &s;till in hopes that we might be taken by &s;ome ve&s;&s;el, or that we might take more pri&s;oners, who, in concert with my&s;elf, might be able to con|trive &s;ome plan whereby we might take the &s;hip, and thereby incapacitate Philips to de|termine whether I &s;hould obtain my freedom before he received his final doom, or not.</P>
<P>As we were &s;ailing, one day, we came within view of a fine merchant ve&s;&s;el, the appearance of which plea&s;ed the capt. much, who &s;wore by heaven he would have it. Accordingly I was ordered to bear off for her as direct as po&s;&s;ible. Phillips being ex|tremely
<PB N="12" REF="045870_0012_1020759D19C62118">
anxious for taking this ve&s;&s;el, walk|ed the deck with his gla&s;s in his hand, view|ing of her the greate&s;t part of the day, and damning me becau&s;e, as he &s;aid, I did not &s;teer &s;o well as I might.</P>
<P>Eleven holes he cut through my hat and the &s;kin of my head, without the lea&s;t pro|vocation, with his broad &s;word. But the merchantman being lightly built and com|pletely rigged, left &s;ight of us before night. Phillips exclaiming in a horrid rage, that the lo&s;s of that fine &s;hip was all my damned do|ings, adding that he wanted the damned thing ju&s;t long enough to &s;ail to hell in.</P>
<P>We had &s;undry pri&s;oners on board, French|men and negroes; we had al&s;o an American with whom I had been intimately acquainted when young, and whom the pirates could neither per&s;uade nor compel to &s;ign their ar|ticles. Thus fortune had &s;ent me one friend with whom I could &s;ympathize under my al|mo&s;t in&s;upportable calamities; though our &s;ympathy was chiefly confined to looks and private ge&s;tures, for we dur&s;t not complain in the hearing of the crew.</P>
<P>About the end of the &s;eventh month from my entering on board, we took a merchant|man belonging to Bo&s;ton, capt. Harridon commander, a young man only twenty two years of age. The father of this young man was a merchant in Bo&s;ton, and had giv|en this &s;on the education requi&s;ite for a mar|riner
<PB N="13" REF="045870_0013_102075A3C2F55AD0">
and &s;ent him to the We&s;tindies, capt. of this ve&s;&s;el, in which he was returning home when we took him.</P>
<P>All except Harridon, James Chee&s;eman a &s;hip carpenter, and a Spani&s;h indian, who was taken with Harridon, my friend whom I mentioned above, and my&s;elf, had been com|pelled to &s;ign the pirates articles. We had been enjoined to &s;ign them but had utterly refu&s;ed, choo&s;ing rather to be killed by the villains, than to be taken, condemned and executed, for being their a&s;&s;ociates. But I &s;uppo&s;e they thought we might be &s;erviceable to them and therefore deemed it be&s;t not to di&s;patch us yet.</P>
<P>One day we took a large ve&s;&s;el, after con|&s;iderable trouble in chacing, but found no|thing on board worthy the attention of the pirates, except their provi&s;ions and water, which being in &s;ome want of, Phillips &s;tript them of it entirely, took out one or two of their hands, and then let them go.</P>
<P>Some of the pirates having been &s;ent on board Harridon's ve&s;&s;el, there remained only &s;ix of the old pirates on board, be&s;ides tho&s;e who had been forced to &s;ign their articles, and as there were five of us who wi&s;hed to e&s;cape from them, we began to think and ev|en to &s;ugge&s;t &s;omething about trying &s;ome &s;cheme to effect that purpo&s;e. There was no time that we could confer together with|out being di&s;covered, except in the dead of
<PB N="14" REF="045870_0014_102075A54BC3DB28">
the night, and even then we dur&s;t not be all together, and con&s;equently could not with|out great difficulty, &s;ucceed in forming any regular plan to effect our e&s;cape.</P>
<P>One day we came in &s;ight of a merchant|man which Phillips imagining would prove a valuable prize gave orders for chacing. His orders were put in execution immediate|ly, but the merchantman being lightly built, and a prime &s;ailer, we chaced her three days before we were able to capture them. Hav|ing made what di&s;po&s;ition he plea&s;ed of the hands &amp;c. he found on board the new prize, Phillips ordered one Fern, a daring re&s;olute fellow of the old pirate crew, to go on board of her, and take command, taking &s;ome of the old crew along with him.</P>
<P>Phillips had now become &s;o exceedingly arbitrary as to be hated by his own crew, but they &s;tood in &s;uch dread of him that they dur&s;t no more contradict his orders than they dur&s;t to die. Soon after night came on, Fern propo&s;ed to the pirates with him, that as they were now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fine ve&s;|&s;el, every way fitted for a crui&s;er, and as good a &s;ailor as Phillips's if they would join him he would put out his lights, and &s;teering by the light of the old pirate, make their e&s;cape from the tyranny of Phillips, and &s;et up for them&s;elves. The crew accordingly joined, and they began to execute their plan, but Phillips &s;u&s;pecting their de&s;ign, on finding
<PB N="15" REF="045870_0015_102075A6D44986F8">
they darkened their &s;hip, put out his own light and endeavoured to follow them; in which de&s;ign he &s;ucceeded &s;o well as to be in &s;ight of them next morning. We continu|ed to chace the new pirate till the third day before we came up with her, when a fierce engagement en&s;ued, but Fern &s;oon finding him&s;elf overpowered, and no hope of e&s;cape, &s;ent word to Phillips, that if he would grant him a pardon he would &s;trike to him, and once more &s;erve him faithfully, but if not they would all fight till they died; Phillips immediately complied with their demand, and &s;ent orders for Fern to come on board his &s;hip, which he did, and Phillips, not re|garding his engagement to pardon, immedi|ately ran his &s;word through his body, and then blew his brains out with his pi&s;tol, and thus glutted his own vengeance, and ridded us of a de&s;perate enemy.</P>
<P>I mentioned before that there were five of us who had not &s;igned the pirate's articles, and as Phillips by killing Fern had left but five of the old pirate crew alive, we began to conceive it a proper opportunity to make our e&s;cape. We were however exceedingly cau|tious, and had not yet had an opportunity to communicate our plans to my Newengland friend beforementioned, yet con&s;cience made the pirates &s;u&s;picious of &s;omething of the kind being in agitation, and from the con&s;e|quent murderous proceedure of Phillips we
<PB N="16" REF="045870_0016_102075A85C546930">
had rea&s;on to apprehend they had in reality di&s;covered our intentions.</P>
<P>My friend the American before mentioned being on board the ve&s;&s;el lately taken from Capt. Harridon, Phillips ordered out a boat and went on board, where he accu&s;ed him with joining in a plot, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by me, to kill him and all his crew, and take the ve&s;&s;el. My friend &s;olemnly denied the accu&s;ation and declared he knew nothing of &s;uch a plan, which was, in fact the ca&s;e, for I afterwards learned that there had nothing been &s;aid to him about it. This reply, however true, did not mitigate the captain's pa&s;&s;ion, in the lea&s;t, for he damned him, &s;wore he would &s;end him to hell, and in&s;tantly ran him through the body with his &s;word, in &s;uch a manner that he twi&s;ted the point of it off, leaving it in his backbone.</P>
<P>My friend, I &s;uppo&s;e, not being con&s;cious of having received his death wound, &s;till denied the charge, and with great earne&s;tne&s;s begged that his life might be &s;pared, but the capt. who&s;e in&s;atiable thir&s;t for flaughter was not &s;ufficiently gorged, damned him, pre|&s;ented his pi&s;tol and &s;hot him through the head, exclaiming, I have &s;ent one of the dev|ils to hell and where is Fillmore, he &s;hall go next. I was then ordered to go aboard Har|ridon's ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>My long familiarity with, &amp; con&s;tant appre|hen&s;ion of death, rendered its near approach|es
<PB N="17" REF="045870_0017_102075AEF34F5870">
le&s;s terrifying than formerly; but I did not receive this me&s;&s;age without heart-rend|ing &s;en&s;ations and thrilling emotions of trepi|dation and fear. But Phillips was complete|ly de&s;potic, and there was no &s;uch thing as evading his commands: I therefore drew up a re&s;olution that if I found he was bent on my death I would &s;ell my life as dear as po&s;&s;i|ble and endeavor to kill him fir&s;t. With this re&s;olution, and as much fortitude as I could mu&s;ter, I went on board to Phillips, and &s;tood by a hand&s;peak that lay upon the deck, Phillips charged me as he had done my friend with contriving to betray him and take the &s;hip. The accu&s;ation was true e|nough, but I concluded a lie was warranta|ble in that ca&s;e, and con&s;equently replied that I knew nothing of any con&s;piracy either again&s;t him or his crew. I had prepared my&s;elf to make re&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;e he offered any abu&s;e, but he had a pi&s;tol concealed un|der his coat, which he pre&s;ented to my brea&s;t and &s;napped it before I had time to make any eva&s;ion; but happily for me, it mi&s;&s;ed fire. He drew it back, cocked and pre&s;ented it again, but I &s;truck it a&s;ide with my hand, &s;o that it went off by my &s;ide without doing any injury.</P>
<P>I thought of knocking out his brains with the hand&s;peak that lay near me, but I knew it would be in&s;tant death for me, and there|fore concluded, if he would leave me, I

I &s;tooped to take up the hand&s;peak, thinking to try him with the but end of that, but upon mature con&s;idera|tion, concluded to let the matter re&s;t a little longer, and watch for a more convenient op|portunity to re&s;ent the injury. The pi&s;tol mi&s;&s;ing fire when &s;napped at my brea&s;t, and then going off by my &s;ide, was a &s;trong in|dication to me that providence had interpo&s;|ed graciou&s;ly in my pre&s;ervation, that our final deliverance from the barbarity of the &s;avage Phillips, and his abandoned banditti, might be the more &s;peedily effected.</P>
<P>A few weeks now en&s;ued which were &s;pent in tolerable good humour and peace among all hands on board, and my&s;elf and friends put on the &s;emblance of content as much as po&s;&s;ible, though we were ince&s;&s;antly &s;eeking opportunities to confer with each other upon &s;ome mode of e&s;cape; but no proper oppor|tunity occurred, nor indeed were our mea&s;|ures properly concerted as yet.</P>
<P>Again we were called upon to &s;ign their
<PB N="19" REF="045870_0019_102075B209247FF8">
flagitious articles, and become willing mem|bers of the piratical band, with menaces of immediate death in ca&s;e we &s;till refu&s;ed; but we had heard their threats too often to be frightened into a compliance by them now.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after this, being about nine months after I was taken, and about two from the time we fell in with and made a prize of the the ve&s;&s;el, board of which Harri&s;on was taken, the crew, in commemmoration of &s;ome &s;ignal advantage, which they had obtained, had a grand carou&s;e; eating, drinking, and &s;pend|ing the day in &s;uch diver&s;ions as their gro&s;s inclinations required. A favorable oppor|tunity now &s;eemed to offer to extricate us from our &s;uffering, and we determined to improve it if po&s;&s;ible. Chee&s;eman was ord|ered by Phillips, to bring &s;ome tools on deck and do &s;omething towards repairing the &s;hip, early next morning, and the ma&s;ter was ord|ered to take an ob&s;ervation next day at noon to find out where we were. Thus far prov|idence &s;eemed to favor our de&s;ign and we felt firm in the determination of executing of it next day.</P>
<P>It was late in the evening before the pi|rates retired to re&s;t, and White and one more of the o'd pirates got into the caboo&s;e, as drunk as bea&s;ts and lay down before the ire. A favorable opportunity now &s;eemed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> offer for us to improve in confering upon &s;ome means for our e&s;cape. We got togeth|er,
<PB N="20" REF="045870_0020_102075B3C981DA68">
held a con&s;ultation and concluded to ri&s;k our lives in trying to work our deliverance, concluding that we had better die in &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e, than &s;hare the fate of our late New|england friend, which we had no doubt would &s;oon overtake us, if we per&s;i&s;ted in our determination never to &s;ign their articles or &s;hare in their unlawful gain.</P>
<P>When I mention that we had determined on an immediate execution of our de&s;ign, I would inform the reader that there were but three of us, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Chee&s;eman, my&s;elf and the Spani&s;h indian before mentioned, for poor Harridon declared that his heart was broken, his re&s;olution and courage gone by a &s;eries of ill-u&s;uage, and that he dur&s;t not engage to a&s;&s;i&s;t but would not di&s;cover our plot: thus there remained only three of us to engage the whole crew, and the indian we felt rath|er dubious about, though we gained a confi|dence in him from his having firmly refu&s;ed &s;everal times, though threatened with imme|diate death, to &s;ub&s;cribe the pirating articles. However I mu&s;t do him the honor to &s;ay he was true to his tru&s;t, and had it not have been for him our plot would mo&s;t probably have failed in the execution.</P>
<P>Chee&s;eman, the indian and my&s;elf got to|ther and agreed that Chee&s;eman &s;hould leave his broad ax on the main deck when he had done u&s;ing of it, and when I &s;aw Chee&s;man make ready to gra&s;p the ma&s;ter, I was to
<PB N="21" REF="045870_0021_102075BA65474238">
catch it up and make the be&s;t u&s;e of it I could, cutting and fla&s;hing all that offered to op|po&s;e me, while the indian was to &s;tand rea|dy to help as occa&s;ion may require. And each one of us in the mean time was to do every thing he could think of to forward the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Our plan being thus concerted, I went down into the caboo&s;e where White and John Ro&s;e Archer, a de&s;perate fellow who had been taken in one of the prizes, and imme|diately joined the pirates, laid on the floor, as before mentioned, drunk as bea&s;ts. I took fire and burnt the&s;e two villains in the feet, while they lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;o badly as to render them unable to be upon deck next day. There were only four left now of the old pirate gang, and five who had joined them &s;ince, be&s;ides the two who I had render|ed incapable of injuring us.</P>
<P>We were up early in the morning and Chee&s;eman u&s;ed the broad ax and left it as a|greed. It was very late in the morning and the pirates were none of them up, and we were afraid they would not ari&s;e until too late to take an ob&s;ervation, and our plan of con&s;equence mu&s;t fall through. To prevent this, about ten o'clock I went to the cabbin door and told the captain the &s;un was almo&s;t up to the meridian. Damn you, &s;aid he, it is none of your bu&s;ine&s;s. This was all the thanks I got, and indeed all I expected for
<PB N="22" REF="045870_0022_102075BBEE0D7978">
my &s;ervice. However, it an&s;wered the end de&s;igned, for the captain, boat&s;wain, quarter ma&s;ter and ma&s;ter came upon deck a little after eleven o'clock. Enquiry was made for White and Archer and their burns im|puted to accident. Harradon was nearly dead with fear and the indian became near as white as any of us. Phillips took notice of Harradon's palene&s;s, and I cloaked the mat|ter by informing him that Harridon had been &s;ick all night, and I believed a dram would help him: Phillips told me to go to his ca&s;e and get a bottle of brandy which I did, and we all drank heartily except the indian who refu&s;ed to ta&s;te a drop, tho' &s;omething apt to drink at other times.</P>
<P>The important cri&s;is now drew near when three of us were to attack the whole crew; the ma&s;ter prepared to take his ob&s;ervation, and Chee&s;eman was walking the deck with a hammar in his hand. The quarterma&s;ter was in the cabbin drawing out &s;ome leaden &s;lugs for a mu&s;ket, and the Spani&s;h indian &s;tood by the cabbin door. The captain and boat&s;wain &s;tood by the mainma&s;t, talking up|on &s;ome matters, and I &s;tood partly behind them, whirling the axe round with my foot, till my knees fairly &s;mote together.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter being bu&s;ied, I &s;aw Chee&s;e|man make the motion to heave him over, and I at that in&s;tant, &s;plit the boat&s;wain's head in twain with the broad ax, and dropped him
<PB N="23" REF="045870_0023_102075BD7657B288">
upon the deck to welter in his gore. Before the capt. had time to put him&s;elf into a po&s;|ture of defence, I gave him a &s;troke with the head of my ax which partly &s;tunned him; at the &s;ame time Chee&s;eman di&s;patched the ma&s;ter overboard, and then came to my a&s;|&s;i&s;tance and gave the capt. a blow with his hammer on the back &s;ide of his head, which put an immediate end to his mortal exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The quarterma&s;ter hearing the bu&s;tle, came running out of the cabbin with his hand up to &s;trike Chee&s;eman with his hammer, and would probably have killed him, had not the indian catched him by the elbow, as he was bringing the hammer down, and there held him, untill I came up and gave him a blow upon the back &s;ide of his head, cutting his wig and neck almo&s;t off, &s;o that his head hung down before him.</P>
<P>We had now di&s;patched all the old pirates except White, and demanded a &s;urren|der of the ve&s;&s;el, which was granted, and tho&s;e poor frenchmen and negroes came to us, fell down, and imbraced our legs and feet, begging for their lives.</P>
<P>White, Archer, and one more of the pi|rates were tried, condemned and executed in Bo&s;ton, the three other pirates were &s;ent to England with the ve&s;&s;el, with whom my friend Chee&s;eman and the indian went like|wi&s;e, whom government liberally rewarded for their &s;ervices, and gave Chee&s;eman an honor|able

birth in one the king's &s;hipyards: the three pirates who went home with the ve&s;&s;el, were hung at execution dock, and the ve&s;&s;el made a prize of by government.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw any of the human &s;pecie more &s;piteful and malicious than White was, from the time he was taken till he was executed. I believe he would have killed me any time in that interval had it been in his power.</P>
<P>The honorable Court which condemned the pirates gave me captain Phillips gun, &s;il|ver hilted &s;word, &s;ilver &s;hoe and knee buck|les, a curious tobaccobox, and two gold rings that the pirate capt. Philips u&s;ed to wear.</P>

At this time &s;ome of the pirates were on deck, and one of them a&s;ked leave to fire another gun, which being granted, he would not &s;wab the gun out nor have the vent &s;top|ped, but put in the cartridge, and &s;tood di|rect before the muzzle to ram it down, by which means the cartridge took fire, and blew him into pieces; it is &s;uppo&s;ed he did this purpo&s;ely in order to e&s;cape the puni&s;hment which he knew mu&s;t be his lot in ca&s;e he was carried into the harbor.</P>
