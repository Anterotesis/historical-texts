<HEAD>Of the Origin and De&s;ign of <HI>GOVERNMENT</HI> in general, with conci&s;e Remarks on the ENGLISH CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>SOME writers have &s;o confounded &s;ociety with government, as to leave little or no di&s;tinction between them; whereas, they are not only different, but have diffe|rent origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedne&s;s; the former promotes our happine&s;s <HI>po&s;&s;itively</HI> by uniting our affections, the latter <HI>negatively</HI> by re&s;training our vices. The one en|courages intercour&s;e, the other creates di&s;|tinctions. The fir&s;t is a patron, the la&s;t a puni&s;her.</P>
<P>Society in every &s;tate is a ble&s;&s;ing, but Government even in its be&s;t &s;tate is but a nece&s;&s;ary evil; in its wor&s;t &s;tate an into|lerable one: for when we &s;uffer, or are ex|po&s;ed to the &s;ame mi&s;eries <HI>by a Government,</HI> which we might expect in a country <HI>without Government,</HI> our calamity is heightened by
<PB N="2" REF="014966_0008_0F954E6ECF970EF0">
reflecting that we furni&s;h the means by which we &s;uffer. Government like dre&s;s is the badge of lo&s;t innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradi&s;e. For were the impul&s;es of con|&s;cience clear, uniform, and irre&s;i&s;tibly o|beyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the ca&s;e, he finds it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;urrender up a part of his property to furni&s;h means for the protection of the re&s;t; and this he is induced to do, by the &s;ame prudence which in every other ca&s;e ad|vi&s;es him, out of two evils to choo&s;e the lea&s;t. Wherefore, &s;ecurity being the true de&s;ign and end of government, it unan&s;wer|ably follows, that whatever form thereof ap|pears mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure it to us, with the lea&s;t expence and greate&s;t benefit, is preferable to all others.</P>
<P>In order to gain a clear and ju&s;t idea of the de&s;ign and end of government, let us &s;uppo&s;e a &s;mall number of per&s;ons &s;ettled in &s;ome &s;e|que&s;tered part of the earth, unconnected with the re&s;t; they will then repre&s;ent the fir&s;t peopling of any country; or of the world. In this &s;tate of natural liberty, &s;ociety will be their fir&s;t thought. A thou&s;and motives will excite them thereto, the &s;trength of one
<PB N="3" REF="014966_0009_0F954E6F84133E50">
man is &s;o unequal to his wants, and his mind &s;o unfitted for perpetual &s;olitude, that he is &s;oon obliged to &s;eek a&s;&s;i&s;tance and relief of another, who in his turn requires the &s;ame. Four or five united would be able to rai&s;e a tolerable dwelling in the mid&s;t of a wilder|ne&s;s, but one man might labour out the com|mon period of life without accompli&s;hing any thing; when he had felled his timber he could not remove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger in the mean time would urge him to quit his work, and e|very different want call him a different way. Di&s;ea&s;e, nay even misfortune would be death; for tho' neither might be mortal, yet either would di&s;able him from living, and reduce him to a &s;tate in which he might rather be &s;aid to peri&s;h, than to die.</P>
<P>Thus nece&s;&s;ity like a gravitating power would &s;oon form our newly arrived emi|grants into &s;ociety, the reciprocal ble&s;&s;ings of which, would &s;uper&s;ede, and render the obligations of law and goverment unnece&s;|&s;ary while they remained perfectly ju&s;t to each other: but as nothing but Heaven is impregnable to vice, it will unavoidably happen that in proportion as they &s;urmount the fir&s;t difficulties of emigration, which
<PB N="4" REF="014966_0010_0F954ECF873D60D8">
bound them together in a common cau&s;e, they will begin to relax in their duty and attachment to each other: and this remi&s;&s;|ne&s;s will point out the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing &s;ome form of government to &s;upply the defect of moral virtue.</P>
<P>Some convenient tree will afford them a State Hou&s;e, under the branches of which the whole Colony may a&s;&s;emble to deliberate on public matters. It is more than proba|ble that their fir&s;t laws will have the title only of REGULATIONS and be enforced by no other penalty than public di&s;e&s;teem. In this fir&s;t parliament every man by natural right will have a &s;eat.</P>
<P>But as the Colony encrea&s;es, the public concerns will encrea&s;e likewi&s;e, and the di&s;tance at which the members may be &s;e|parated, will render it too inconvenient for all of them to meet on every occa&s;ion as at fir&s;t, when their number was &s;mall, their habitations near, and the public concerns few and trifling, This will point out the convenience of their con&s;enting to leave the legi&s;lative part to be managed by a &s;elect number cho&s;en from the whole body, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have the &s;ame concerns at
<PB N="5" REF="014966_0011_0F954ED044A82F38">
&s;take which tho&s;e have who appointed them, and who will act in the &s;ame manner as the whole body would act were they pre|&s;ent. If the colony continues encrea&s;ing, it will become nece&s;&s;ary to augment the num|ber of the repre&s;entatives, and that the in|tere&s;t of every part of the colony may be attended to, it will be found be&s;t to divide the whole into convenient parts, each part &s;ending its proper number: and that the <HI>elected</HI> might never form to them&s;elves an intere&s;t &s;eparate from the electors, prudence will point out the propriety of having elec|tions often: becau&s;e as the elected might by that means return and mix again with the general body of the electors in a few months, their fidelity to the public will be &s;ecured by the prudent reflection of not making a rod for them&s;elves. And as this frequent in|terchange will e&s;tabli&s;h a common intere&s;t with every part of the community, they will mutually and naturally &s;upport each other, and on this (not on the unmeaning name of king) depends the <HI>&s;trength of go|vernment; and the happine&s;s of the governed.</HI></P>
<P>Here then is the origin and ri&s;e of govern|ment; namely, a mode rendered nece&s;&s;ary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the
<PB N="6" REF="014966_0012_0F954ED0F61DDDD8">
world; here too is the de&s;ign and end of government, viz. Freedom and &s;ecurity. And however our eyes may be dazzled with &s;how, or our ears deceived by &s;ound; how|ever prejudice may warp our wills, or in|tere&s;t darken our under&s;tanding, the &s;imple voice of nature and of rea&s;on will &s;ay, 'tis right.</P>
<P>I draw my idea of the form of govern|ment from a principle in nature which no art can overturn, viz. That the more &s;imple any thing is, the le&s;s liable it is to be di&s;or|dered, and the ea&s;ier repaired when di&s;order|ed; and with this maxim in view I offer a few remarks on the &s;o much boa&s;ted con|&s;titution of England. That it was noble for the dark and &s;lavi&s;h times in which it was erected, is granted. When the world was over-run with tyranny the lea&s;t remove there|from was a glorious re&s;cue. But that it is imperfect, &s;ubject to convul&s;ions, and inca|pable of producing what it &s;eems to pro|mi&s;e is ea&s;ily demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>Ab&s;olute governments, (tho' the di&s;grace of human nature) have this advantage with them, that they are &s;imple; if the people &s;uffer, they know the head from which their
<PB N="7" REF="014966_0013_0F954ED36EDAD3C8">
&s;uffering &s;prings; know likewi&s;e the reme|dy; and are not bewildered by a variety of cau&s;es and cures. But the con&s;titution of England is &s;o exceedingly complex, that the nation may &s;uffer for years together without being able to di&s;cover in which part the fault lies, &s;ome will &s;ay in one and &s;ome in another, and every political phy&s;i|cian will advi&s;e a different medicine.</P>
<P>I know it is difficult to get over local or long &s;tanding prejudices, yet if we will &s;uffer our&s;elves to examine the component parts of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, we &s;hall find them to be the ba&s;e remains of two ancient tyrannies, compounded with &s;ome new Republican materials.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI>&mdash;The remains of Monarchical ty|ranny in the per&s;on of the King.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI>&mdash;The remains of Ari&s;tocratical tyranny in the per&s;ons of the Peers.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>&mdash;The new Republican materials, in the per&s;ons of the Commons, on who&s;e virtue depends the freedom of England.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t by being hereditary are
<PB N="8" REF="014966_0014_0F954ED3F6E38768">
independent of the People; wherefore in a <HI>con&s;titutional &s;en&s;e</HI> they contribute nothing towards the freedom of the State.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the con&s;titution of England is an <HI>union</HI> of three powers reciprocally <HI>checking</HI> each other, is farcical, either the words have no meaning or they are flat contradic|tions.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the Commons are a check up|on the King, pre&s;uppo&s;es two things.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI>&mdash;That the King is not to be tru&s;t|ed without being looked after; or in other words, that a thir&s;t for ab&s;olute power is the natural di&s;ea&s;e of Monarchy.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI>&mdash;That the Commons by being appointed for that purpo&s;e, are either wi&s;er or more worthy of confidence than the Crown.</P>
<P>But as the &s;ame con&s;titution which gives the Commons a power to check the King by with-holding the &s;upplies, gives after|wards the King a power to check the Com|mons by empowering him to reject their other bills; it again &s;uppo&s;es that the King is
<PB N="9" REF="014966_0015_0F954ED4BA5C6630">
wi&s;er than tho&s;e whom it has already &s;uppo&s;|ed to be wi&s;er than him. A mere ab&s;urdity!</P>
<P>There is &s;omething exceedingly ridiculous in the compo&s;ition of Monarchy; it fir&s;t ex|cludes a man from the means of informati|on, yet empowers him to act in ca&s;es where the highe&s;t judgment is required.&mdash; The &s;tate of a king &s;huts him from the world yet the bu&s;ine&s;s of a king requires him to know it thoroughly: wherefore, the dif|ferent parts by unnaturally oppo&s;ing and de&s;troying each other, prove the whole character to be ab&s;urd and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Some writers have explained the Engli&s;h con&s;titution thus; the King &s;ay they is one, the people another; the Peers are an hou&s;e in behalf of the King; the Commons in be|half of the people; but this hath all the di&s;tinctions of an hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf; and tho' the expre&s;&s;ions be plea&s;antly arrang|ed, yet when examined they appear idle and ambiguous: and it will always happen, that the nice&s;t con&s;truction that words are capa|ble of, when applied to the de&s;cription of &s;omething which either cannot exi&s;t, or is too incomprehen&s;ible to be within the com|pa&s;s of de&s;cription, will be words of &s;ound
<PB N="10" REF="014966_0016_0F954ED57916F998">
only, and tho' they may amu&s;e the ear, they cannot inform the mind: for this explanation includes a previous que&s;tion, viz. <HI>how came the King by a power which the people are afraid to tru&s;t and always obliged to check?</HI> Such a power could not be the gift of a wi&s;e people, neither can any power <HI>which needs checking</HI> be from God: yet the provi&s;ion which the con&s;titution makes, &s;uppo&s;es &s;uch a power to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>But the provi&s;ion is unequal to the ta&s;k, the means either cannot, or will not ac|compli&s;h the end, and the whole affair is a <HI>Felo de &s;e</HI>: for as the greater weight will al|ways carry up the le&s;s, and as all the wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to know which power in the con&s;titution has the mo&s;t weight, for that will govern: and tho' the others, or a part of them, may clog, or check the rapidity of its motion, yet &s;o long as they cannot &s;top it, their endeavours will be ineffectual: The fir&s;t moving power will at la&s;t have its way, and what it wants in &s;peed will be &s;upplied by time.</P>
<P>That the crown is this overbearing part in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution needs not be men|tioned,
<PB N="11" REF="014966_0017_0F954ED645D37868">
and that it derives its whole con&s;e|quence merely from being the giver of pla|ces and pen&s;ions is &s;elf evident, wherefore, tho' we have been wi&s;e enough to lock the door again&s;t ab&s;olute Monarchy, we at the &s;ame time have been fooli&s;h enough to put the Crown in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the key.</P>
<P>The prejudice of Engli&s;hmen in favour of their own government by King, Lords and Commons, ari&s;es as much or more from na|tional pride than rea&s;on. Individuals are undoubtedly &s;afer in England than in &s;ome other countries: but the will of the King is as much the law of the land in Britain as in France with this difference, that in&s;tead of proceeding directly from his mouth, it is handed to the people under the more formidable &s;hape of an act of parliament. For the fate of Charles the Fir&s;t, hath only made kings more &s;ubtle&mdash;not more ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Wherefore laying a&s;ide all national pride and prejudice in favour of modes and forms, the plain truth is, that <HI>it is wholly owing to the con&s;titution of the people, and not to the con&s;titution of the government</HI> that the crown is not as oppre&s;&s;ive in England as in Turkey.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="014966_0018_0F954ED706108D20">An enquiry into the <HI>con&s;titutional errors</HI> in the Engli&s;h form of government, is at this time highly nece&s;&s;ary; for as we are never in a proper condition of doing ju&s;tice to others, while we continue under the in|fluence of &s;ome leading partiality, &s;o neither are we capable of doing it to our&s;elves while we remain fettered by any ob&s;tinate preju|dice. And as a man who is attached to a pro&s;titute is unfitted to choo&s;e or judge of a wife, &s;o any prepo&s;&s;e&s;ion in favour of a rot|ten con&s;titution of government will di&s;able us from di&s;cerning a good one.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>MONARCHY</HI> and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND being originally equals in the order of creation, the equality could only be de&s;troyed by &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent circum&s;tance: the di&s;tinctions of rich and poor may in a great mea&s;ure be ac|counted for, and that without having re|cour&s;e to the har&s;h ill-&s;ounding names of oppre&s;&s;ion and avarice. Oppre&s;&s;ion is often the <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> but &s;eldom or never the <HI>means</HI> of riches: and tho' avarice will pre|&s;erve a man from being nece&s;&s;itou&s;ly poor, it generally makes him too timorous to be wealthy.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014966_0019_0F954ED7CA9361D8">But there is another and greater di&s;tinction for which no truly natural or religious rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, and that is, the di&s;tinction of Men into KINGS and SUBJECTS. Male and female are the di&s;tinctions of nature, good and bad the di&s;tinctions of Heaven; but how a race of men came into the world &s;o exalted above the re&s;t, and di&s;tingui&s;hed like &s;ome new &s;pecies, is worth enquiring into, and whether they are the means of happine&s;s or of mi&s;ery to mankind.</P>
<P>In the early ages of the world according to the &s;cripture chronology there were no kings; the con&s;equence of which was, there were no wars; it is the pride of kings which throws mankind into confu&s;ion. Holland without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this la&s;t century, than any of the monar|chical governments in Europe. Antiquity favours the &s;ame remark; for the quiet and rural lives of the fir&s;t Patriarchs hath a hap|py &s;omething in them, which vani&s;hes away when we come to the hi&s;tory of Jewi&s;h royalty.</P>
<P>Government by kings was fir&s;t introduc|ed into the World by the Heathens, from whom the children of I&s;real copied the cu&s;|tom
<PB N="14" REF="014966_0020_0F954ED8773AA048">
It was the mo&s;t pro&s;perous invention the Devil ever &s;et on foot for the promotion of idolatry. The Heathens paid divine ho|nours to their decea&s;ed Kings, and the Chri&s;tian World hath improved on the plan by doing the &s;ame to their living ones.

<P>As the exalting one man &s;o greatly above the re&s;t cannot be ju&s;tified on the equal rights of nature, &s;o neither can it be defended on the authority of &s;cripture; for the will of the Almighty as declared by Gideon and the Prophet Samuel, expre&s;&s;ly di&s;approves of government by Kings, all anti-monar|chical parts of &s;cripture have been very &s;moothly glo&s;&s;ed over in monarchical go|vernments, but they undoubtedly merit the attention of countries which have their governments yet to form. "<HI>Render unto Cae&s;ar the things which are Cae&s;ar's</HI>" is the &s;cripture doctrine of courts, yet it is no &s;upport of monarchical government, for the Jews at that time were without a king and in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage to the Romans.</P>

from the Mo&s;aic account of the creation, till the Jews under a national delu&s;ion re|que&s;ted a king. Till then, their form of go|vernment, (except in exraordinary ca&s;es where the Almighty interpo&s;ed) was a kind of Republic admini&s;tred by a judge and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it was held &s;inful to acknowledge any Being under that title but the Lord of Ho&s;ts. And when a man &s;eriou&s;ly reflects on the idolatrous homage which is paid to the per|&s;ons of kings, he need not wonder that the Almighty ever jealous of his honour, &s;hould di&s;approve of a form of government which &s;o impiou&s;ly invades the prerogative of Heaven.</P>
<P>Monarchy is ranked in &s;cripture as one of the &s;ins of the Jews, for which a cur&s;e in re&s;erve is denounced again&s;t them. The hi&s;|tory of that tran&s;action is worth attending to.</P>
<P>The children of I&s;rael being oppre&s;&s;ed by the Midianites, Gideon marched again&s;t them with a &s;mall army, and victory thro' the Divine interpo&s;ition decided in his fa|vour, The Jews elate with &s;ucce&s;s, and attributing it to the general&s;hip of Gideon, propo&s;ed making him a king; &s;aying <HI>Rule

<P>About one hundred and thirty years after this they fell again into the &s;ame error.

hath good rea&s;on to believe that there is as much of king-craft, as prie&s;t-craft, in with|holding the &s;cripture from the public in po|pi&s;h countries. For monarchy in every in|&s;tance is the popery of government.</P>
<P>To the evil of monarchy we have added that of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and as the fir&s;t is a degradation and le&s;&s;ening of our&s;elves, &s;o the &s;econd, claimed as a matter of right, is an in&s;ult and an impo&s;ition on po&s;terity. For all men being originally equals, no one by birth could have a right to &s;et up his own family in perpetual preference to all others for ever, and tho' him&s;elf might de&s;erve &s;ome decent degree of honours of his cotempora|ries, yet his de&s;cendants might be far too un|worthy to inherit them. One of the &s;trong|e&s;t natural proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature di&s;approves it, otherwi&s;e &s;he would not &s;o frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an <HI>a&s;s for a lion.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, as no man at fir&s;t could po&s;&s;e&s;s any other public honours than were be&s;tow|ed upon him, &s;o the givers of tho&s;e honours could have no power to give away the right of po&s;terity, and though they might &s;ay "we choo&s;e you for our head" they could not with|out

Be|cau&s;e &s;uch an unwi&s;e, unju&s;t; unnatural com|pact might (perhaps) in the next &s;ucce&s;&s;ion put them under the government of a rogue or a fool. Mo&s;t wi&s;e men in their private &s;entiments have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of tho&s;e evils, which when once e&s;tabli&s;hed is not ea&s;ily re|moved: many &s;ubmit from fear, others from &s;uper&s;tition, and the more powerful part &s;hares with the king the plunder of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This is &s;uppo&s;ing the pre&s;ent race of kings in the world to have had an honorable ori|gin: whereas it is more than probable, that could we take off the dark covering of anti|quity and trace them to their fir&s;t ri&s;e, that we &s;hould find the fir&s;t of them nothing better than the principal ruffian of &s;ome re&s;t|le&s;s gang, who&s;e &s;avage manners or pre-emi|nence in &s;ubtilty obtained him the title of chief among plunderers: and who by increa|&s;ing in power and extending his depredations, over-awed the quiet and defencele&s;s to pur|cha&s;e their &s;afety by frequent contributions. Yet his electors could have no idea of giving hereditary right to his de&s;cendants, becau&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="014966_0028_0F954F2139056980">
&s;uch a perpetual exclu&s;ion of them&s;elves was incompatible with the free and unre&s;trained principles they profe&s;&s;ed to live by. Where|fore, hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the early ages of monarchy could not take place as a matter of claim, but as &s;omething ca&s;ual or com|plimental; but as few or no records were extant in tho&s;e days, and traditionary hi&s;tory &s;tuff'd with fables, it was very ea&s;y after the lap&s;e of a few generations, to trump up &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious tale conveniently timed, Mahomet like, to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar. Perhaps the di&s;orders which threatened, or &s;eemed to threaten, on the decea&s;e of a leader and the choice of a new one (for elections among ruffians could not be very orderly) induced many at fir&s;t to favour hereditary preten&s;i|ons; by which means it happened, as it hath happened &s;ince, that what at fir&s;t was &s;ubmitted to as a convenience was after|wards claimed as a right.</P>
<P>England &s;ince the conque&s;t hath known &s;ome few good monarchs, but groaned be|neath a much larger number of bad ones: yet no man in his &s;en&s;es can &s;ay that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very honourable one. A French Ba&s;tard

However it is need|le&s;s to &s;pend much time in expo&s;ing the folly of hereditary right, if there are any &s;o weak as to believe it, let them promi&s;|cuou&s;ly wor&s;hip the A&s;s and Lion and wel|come. I &s;hall neither copy their humility nor di&s;turb their devotion.</P>
<P>Yet I &s;hould be glad to a&s;k how they &s;up|po&s;e kings came at fir&s;t? the que&s;tion ad|mits but of three an&s;wers, viz. either by lot, by election or by u&s;urpation. If the fir&s;t king was taken by lot, it e&s;tabli&s;hes a precedent for the next, which excludes hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Saul was by lot yet the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was not hereditary, neither does it appear from that tran&s;action there was any intention it ever &s;hould. If the fir&s;t king of any country was by election that likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hes a precedent for the next; for to &s;ay that the right of all future gene|rations is taken away by the act of the fir&s;t electors in their choice not only of a king, but of a family of kings for ever, hath no parallel in or out of &s;cripture but the doctrine

of original &s;in, which &s;uppo&s;es the free-will of all men lo&s;t in Adam: and from &s;uch compari&s;on, and it will admit of no other, hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion can derive no glory. For as in Adam all &s;inned, and as in the fir&s;t electors all men obeyed; as in the one all mankind were &s;ubjected to Satan, and in the other to &s;overeignty; as our innocence was lo&s;t in the fir&s;t, and our authority in the la&s;t; and as both di&s;able us from re|a&s;&s;uming &s;ome former &s;tate and privilege, it unan&s;werably follow; that original &s;in and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are parallels. Di&s;ho|norable rank! inglorious connection! yet the mo&s;t &s;ubtle &s;ophi&s;t cannot produce a ju&s;ter &s;imile.</P>
<P>As to u&s;urpation no man will be &s;o hardy as to defend it; and that William the con|quer was an u&s;urper is a fact not to be contradicted. The plain truth is, that the antiquity of Engli&s;h monarchy will not bear looking into.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;o much the ab&s;urdity as the evil of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which concerns mankind. Did it en&s;ure a race of good and wi&s;e men it would have the &s;eal of divine authority, but as it opens a door to the <HI>fool|i&s;h,</HI> the <HI>wicked,</HI> and the <HI>improper,</HI> it hath

in it the nature of oppre&s;&s;ion. Men who look upon them&s;elves born to reign, and others to obey, &s;oon grow in&s;olent&mdash;&s;e|lected from the re&s;t of Mankind their minds are ea&s;ily poi&s;oned by importance; and the world they act in differs &s;o ma|terially from the world at large, that they have but little opportunity of knowing its true intere&s;ts, and when they &s;ucceed to the government are frequently the mo&s;t ig|norant and unfit of any throughout the do|minions.</P>
<P>Another evil which attends hereditary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, is, that the throne is &s;ubject to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a minor at any age; all which time the regency acting under the cover of a king have every opportunity and inducement to betray their tru&s;t. The &s;ame national misfortune happens when a king worn out with age and infirmity enters the la&s;t &s;tage of human weakne&s;s. In both the&s;e ca&s;es the public becomes a prey to every mi&s;creant who can tamper &s;ucce&s;sfully with the follies either of age or infancy.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plau&s;ible plea which hath ever been offered in favour of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is, that it pre&s;erves a Nation from civil wars;
<PB N="26" REF="014966_0032_0F954F25DA0C78E8">
and were this true, it would be weighty; whereas it is the mo&s;t barefaced fal&s;ity ever impo&s;ed upon mankind. The whole hi&s;to|ry of England di&s;owns the fact. Thirty kings and two minors have reigned in that di&s;tracted kingdom &s;ince the conque&s;t, in which time there has been (including the Revolution) no le&s;s than eight civil wars and nineteen Rebellions. Wherefore in&s;tead of making for peace, it makes again&s;t it, and de&s;troys the very foundation it &s;eems to &s;tand upon.</P>
<P>The conte&s;t for monarchy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter laid England in a &s;cene of blood for many years. Twelve pitched battles be&s;ides &s;kir|mi&s;hes and &s;ieges were fought between Henry and Edward. Twice was Henry pri&s;oner to Edward, who in his turn was pri&s;oner to Henry. And &s;o uncertain is the fate of war and the temper of a Nation, when nothing but per&s;onal matters are the ground of a quarrel, that Henry was taken in triumph from a pri&s;on to a palace, and Edward obliged to fly from a palace to a foreign land: Yet as &s;udden tran&s;itions of temper are &s;eldom la&s;ting. Henry in his turn was driven from the throne and Edward

recalled to &s;ucceed him. The parliament always following the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>This conte&s;t began in the reign of Henry the &s;ixth and was not entirely extingui&s;hed till Henry the &s;eventh. in whom the fami|lies were united. Including a period of 67 years, viz. from 1422 to 1489.</P>

<P>If we enquire into the bu&s;ine&s;s of a King we &s;hall find that in &s;ome countries they have none; and after &s;auntering away their lives without plea&s;ure to them&s;elves or ad|vantage to the nation, withdraw from the &s;cene and leave their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to tread the &s;ame idle round. In ab&s;olute monarchies the whole weight of bu&s;ine&s;s civil and mili|tary lies on the King; the children of I&s;rael in their reque&s;t for a King urged this plea "that he may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles." But in countries where he is neither a judge nor a general as in England, a man would be puzzled to know what is his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>It hath been reported of the late Mr. Pel|ham (who tho' an able mini&s;ter was not without his faults) that on his being attack|ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons on the &s;core that his mea&s;ures were only of a temporary kind, replied "<HI>they will la&s;t my time.</HI>" Should a thought &s;o fatal and unmanly po&s;&s;e&s;s the Colonies in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, the name of ance&s;tors will be remembered by future generations with dete&s;tation.</P>

own is admitted; and &s;he would have de|fended Turkey from the &s;ame motive viz. the &s;ake of trade and dominion.</P>
<P>Alas! we have been long led away by ancient prejudices and made large &s;acrifices to &s;uper&s;tition. We have boa&s;ted the pro|tection of Great Britain, without con&s;idering, that her motive was <HI>intere&s;t</HI> not <HI>attachment</HI>; that &s;he did not protect us from <HI>our enemies</HI> on <HI>our account,</HI> but from <HI>her enemies</HI> on <HI>her own account,</HI> from tho&s;e who had no quarrel with us on any <HI>other account,</HI> and who will always be our enemies on the <HI>&s;ame account.</HI> Let Britain wave her preten&s;ions to the Con|tinent, or the Continent throw off the de|pendance, and we &s;hould be at peace with France and Spain were they at war with Britain. The mi&s;eries of Hanover la&s;t war ought to warn us again&s;t connections.</P>
<P>It hath lately been a&s;&s;erted in parliament, that the Colonies have no relation to each other but through the Parent Country, <HI>i. e.</HI> that Penn&s;ylvania and the Jer&s;eys and &s;o on for the re&s;t, are &s;i&s;ter Colonies by the way of England; this is certainly a very round|about way of proving relation&s;hip, but it is the neare&s;t and only true way of proving en|mity
<PB N="34" REF="014966_0040_0F954F2BB77A6098">
(or enemy&s;hip, if I may &s;o call it.) France and Spain never were, nor perhaps ever will be our enemies as <HI>Americans</HI> but as our being the <HI>&s;ubjects of Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But Britain is the parent country &s;ay &s;ome. Then the more &s;hame upon her conduct. Even brutes do not devour their young, nor &s;avages make war upon their families; wherefore the a&s;&s;ertion if true, turns to her reproach; but it happens not to be true, or only partly &s;o, and the phra&s;e, <HI>parent</HI> or <HI>mother country,</HI> hath been je&s;ui|tically adopted by the King and his para&s;ites, with a low papi&s;tical de&s;ign of gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakne&s;s of our minds. Europe and not England is the parent country of America. This new World hath been the a&s;ylum for the per&s;e|cuted lovers of civil and religious liberty from <HI>every part</HI> of Europe. Hither have they fled, not from the tender embraces of the mother, but from the cruelty of the mon&s;ter; and it is &s;o far true of England, that the &s;ame tyranny which drove the fir&s;t emigrants from home, pur&s;ues their de&s;cen|dants &s;till.</P>
<P>In this exten&s;ive quarter of the Globe, we
<PB N="35" REF="014966_0041_0F954F2C847E15E0">
forget the narrow limits of three hundred and &s;ixty miles (the extent of England) and carry our friend&s;hip on a larger &s;cale; we claim brotherhood with every European Chri&s;tian, and triumph in the genero&s;ity of the &s;entiment.</P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve by what regular gradations we &s;urmount the force of local pre|judice as we enlarge our acquaintance with the World. A man born in any town in England divided into pari&s;hes, will naturally a&s;&s;ociate mo&s;t with his fellow-pari&s;hioners (becau&s;e their intere&s;ts in many ca&s;es will be com|mon) and di&s;tingui&s;h him by the name of <HI>neighbour</HI>: if he meet him but a few miles from home, he drops the narrow idea of a &s;treet, and &s;alutes him by the name of <HI>town&s;man</HI>: if he travel out of the county and meet him in any other, he forgets the minor divi&s;ions of &s;treet and town and calls him <HI>countryman,</HI> i. e. <HI>county-man:</HI> but if in their foreign excur&s;ions they &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate in France, or any other part of <HI>Europe,</HI> their local remembrance would be enlarged into that of <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI> And by a ju&s;t parity of rea&s;oning, all Europeans meeting in America, or any other quarter of the Globe, are <HI>coun|trymen</HI>; for England, Holland, Germany,
<PB N="36" REF="014966_0042_0F954F2D45E9EA80">
or Sweden, when compared with the whole, &s;tand in the &s;ame places on the larger &s;cale, which the divi&s;ions of &s;treet, town, and county do on the &s;maller ones; Di&s;tinctions too limitted for Continental minds. Not one third of the inhabitants, even of this Province, are of Engli&s;h de|&s;cent. Wherefore, I reprobate the phra&s;e of Parent or Mother Country applied to England only, as being fal&s;e,&s;elfi&s;h, nar|row and ungenerous.</P>
<P>But admitting, that we were all of Engli&s;h de&s;cent, what does it amount to? Nothing. Britain being now an open enemy, extin|gui&s;hes every other name and title: and to &s;ay that reconciliation is our duty, is truly farcical. The fir&s;t king of England, of the pre&s;ent line (William the Conqueror) was a Frenchman, and half the Peers of England are de&s;cendants from the &s;ame country; wherefore, by the &s;ame method of rea&s;oning, England ought to he governed by France.</P>
<P>Much hath been &s;aid of the united &s;trength of Britain and the Colonies, that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world: But this is mere pre&s;umption, the &s;ate of war is uncertain, neither do the ex|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="37" REF="014966_0043_0F954F2F6CD134A0">
mean any thing, for this Conti|nent would never &s;uffer it&s;elf to be drained of inhabitants, to &s;upport the Briti&s;h Arms in either A&s;ia, Africa, or Europe.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what have we to do with &s;etting the world at defiance? Our plan is com|merce, and that well attended to, will &s;e|cure us the peace and friend&s;hip of all Eu|rope, becau&s;e it is the intere&s;t of all Europe to have America a free port. Her trade will always be a protection, and her barrenne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver will &s;ecure her from invaders.</P>
<P>I challenge the warme&s;t advocate for re|conciliation, to &s;hew, a &s;ingle advantage that this Continent can reap, by being connected with Great Britain. I repeat the challenge, not a &s;ingle advantage is derived. Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe and our imported goods mu&s;t be paid for buy them where we will.</P>
<P>But the injuries and di&s;advantages we &s;u&s;|tain by that connection, are without num|ber, and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to our&s;elves, in&s;truct us to renounce the alliance: becau&s;e any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, or dependance on Great Britain, tends directly
<PB N="38" REF="014966_0044_0F954F2F951552D8">
to involve this Continent in European wars and quarrels. As Europe is our market for trade, we ought to form no political connec|tion with any part of it. 'Tis the true in|tere&s;t of America, to &s;teer clear of European contentions, which &s;he never can do, while by her dependance on Britain, &s;he is made the make-weight in the &s;cale of Briti&s;h politics.</P>
<P>Europe is too thickly planted with King|doms, to be long at peace, and whenever a war breaks out between England and any foreign power, the trade of America goes to ruin, <HI>becau&s;e of her connection with Britain.</HI> The next war may not turn out like the la&s;t, and &s;hould it not, the advocates for re|conciliation now, will be wi&s;hing for &s;e|paration then, becau&s;e neutrality in that ca&s;e, would be a &s;afer convoy than a man of war. Every thing that is right or rea&s;on|able pleads for &s;eparation. The blood of the &s;lain, the weeping voice of nature cries, 'TIS TIME TO PART. Even the di&s;tance at which the Almighty hath placed England and America, is a &s;trong and natural proof, that the authority of the one over the other, was never the de&s;ign of Heaven. The time likewi&s;e at which the Continent
<PB N="39" REF="014966_0045_0F954F30577E30D0">
was di&s;covered, adds weight to the argu|ment, and the manner in which it was peopled encrea&s;es the force of it.&mdash;The Reformation was preceded by the di&s;covery of America; As if the Almighty graciou&s;ly meant to open a &s;anctuary to the per&s;ecuted in future years, when home &s;hould afford neither friend&s;hip nor &s;afety.</P>
<P>The authority of Great Britain over this Continent is a form of Government which &s;ooner or later mu&s;t have an end: And a &s;erious mind can draw no true plea&s;ure by looking forward, under the painful and po&s;i|tive conviction, that what he calls "the pre|&s;ent con&s;titution," is merely temporary. As parents, we can have no joy, knowing that this government is not &s;ufficiently la&s;ting to en&s;ure any thing which we may bequeath to po&s;terity: And by a plain method of argu|ment, as we are running the next genera|tion into debt, we ought to do the work of it, otherwi&s;e we u&s;e them meanly and piti|fully. In order to di&s;cover the line of our duty rightly, we &s;hould take our children in our hand, and fix our &s;tation a few years far|ther into life; that eminence will pre&s;ent a pro&s;pect, which a few pre&s;ent fears and pre|judices conceal from our &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="014966_0046_0F954F30F6F79820">Though I would carefully avoid giving unnece&s;&s;ary offence, yet I am inclined to believe, that all tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e the doctrine of reconciliation, may be included within the following de&s;criptions. Intere&s;ted men who are not to be tru&s;ted, weak men who cannot &s;ee, prejudiced men who will not &s;ee, and a certain &s;et of moderate men who think better of the European world than it de&s;erves; and this la&s;t cla&s;s, by an ill-judged deliberation, will be the cau&s;e of more calamities to this Continent, than all the other three.</P>
<P>It is the good fortune of many to live di&s;tant from the &s;cene of pre&s;ent &s;orrow; the evil is not &s;ufficiently brought to their doors to make them feel the preca|riou&s;ne&s;s with which all American property is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. But let our imaginations tran&s;port us for a few moments to Bo&s;|ton; that &s;eat of wretchedne&s;s will teach us wi&s;dom, and in&s;truct us for ever to re|nounce a power in whom we can have no tru&s;t.

<P>Men of pa&s;&s;ive tempers look &s;omewhat lightly over the offences of Britain, and &s;till hoping for the be&s;t, are apt to call out. <HI>Come, come, we &s;hall be friends again for all this.</HI> But examine the pa&s;&s;ions and feelings of mankind: bring the doctrine of reconciliation to the touch&s;tone of nature, and then tell me, whether you can hereafter love, honour, and faithfully &s;erve the power that hath carried fire and &s;word into your land? If you cannot do all the&s;e, then are you only deceiving your&s;elves, and by your delay bringing ruin upon po&s;terity. Your future connection with Britain whom you can neither love nor honour, will be forced and unnatural, and being formed only on the plan of pre&s;ent convenience, will in a little time, fall into a relap&s;e more wretched than the fir&s;t. But if you &s;ay, you can &s;till pa&s;s the violations over, then I a&s;k, hath your hou&s;e been burnt? Hath your property been de&s;troyed before your face? Are your

wife and children de&s;titute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on? Have you lo&s;t a parent or a child by their hands, and your|&s;elf the ruined and wretched &s;urvivor? If you have not, then are you not a judge of tho&s;e who have. But if you have and &s;till can &s;hake hands with the murderers, then are you unworthy the name of hu&s;band, father, friend, or lover, and whatever may be your rank or title in life, you have the heart of a coward, and the &s;pirit of a &s;yco|phant.</P>
<P>This is not inflaming or exaggerating matters, but trying them by tho&s;e feelings and affections which nature ju&s;tifies, and without which, we &s;hould be incapable of di&s;charging the &s;ocial duties of life, or en|joying the felicities of it. I mean not to exhibit horror for the purpo&s;e of provoking revenge, but to awaken us from fatal and unmanly &s;lumbers, that we may pur&s;ue de|terminately &s;ome fixed object. 'Tis not in the power of England or of Europe to con|quer America, if &s;he doth not conquer her|&s;elf by delay and timidity. The pre&s;ent winter is worth an age if rightly employed, but if lo&s;t or neglected, the whole Continent
<PB N="43" REF="014966_0049_0F954F3339C63CC8">
will partake of the misfortune; and there is no puni&s;hment which that man doth not de&s;erve, be he who, or what, or where he will, that may be the means of &s;acrificing a &s;ea&s;on &s;o precious and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>'Tis repugnant to rea&s;on, to the univer&s;al order of things; to all examples from former ages, to &s;uppo&s;e, that this Continent can long remain &s;ubject to any external power. The mo&s;t &s;anguine in Britain doth not think &s;o. The utmo&s;t &s;tretch of human wi&s;dom cannot at this time compa&s;s a plan, &s;hort of &s;eparation, which can promi&s;e the Continent even a year's &s;ecurity. Reconciliation is <HI>now</HI> a fallacious dream. Nature hath de&s;erted the connection, and art cannot &s;upply her place. For as Milton wi&s;ely expre&s;&s;es "never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced &s;o deep."</P>
<P>Every quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual. Our prayers have been rejected with di&s;dain; and hath tended to convince us that nothing flatters vanity or confirms ob&s;tinacy in Kings more than repeated pe|titioning&mdash;and nothing hath contributed more, than that very mea&s;ure, to make the Kings of Europe ab&s;olute.

and Sweden. Wherfore, &s;ince no|thing but blows will do, for God's &s;ake let us come to a final &s;eparation, and not leave the next generation to be cutting throats under the violated unmeaning names of parent and child.</P>
<P>To &s;ay they will never attempt it again is idle and vi&s;ionary, we thought &s;o at the repeal of the &s;tamp-act, yet a year or two undeceived us; as well may we &s;uppo&s;e that nations which have been once defeated will never renew the quarrel.</P>
<P>As to government matters 'tis not in the power of Britain to do this Continent ju&s;|tice: the bu&s;ine&s;s of it will &s;oon be too weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of convenience, by a power &s;o di&s;tant from us, and &s;o very ignor|ant of us; for if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us. To be always running three or four thou&s;and miles with a tale or a petition, waiting four or five months for an an&s;wer, which when obtained requires five or &s;ix more to explain it in, will in a few years be looked upon as folly and childi&s;hne&s;s&mdash;There was a time when it
<PB N="45" REF="014966_0051_0F954F34C290DC40">
was proper, and there is a proper time for it to cea&s;e.</P>
<P>Small i&s;lands not capable of protecting them&s;elves are the proper objects for go|vernment to take under their care: but there is &s;omething very ab&s;urd, in &s;uppo&s;ing a Continent to be perpetually governed by an i&s;land. In no in&s;tance hath nature made the &s;atellite larger than its primary planet, and as England and America with re&s;pect to each other rever&s;e the common order of nature&punc; it is evident they belong to different &s;y&s;tems. England to Europe: America to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am not induced by motives of pride, party or re&s;entment to e&s;pou&s;e the doctrine of &s;eparation and independence; I am clear|ly po&s;itively, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly per&s;uaded that 'tis the true intere&s;t of this Continent to be &s;o; that every thing &s;hort of that is mere patchwork, that it can afford no la&s;ting felicity,&mdash;that it is leaving the &s;word to our children, and &s;hrinking back at a time, when a little more, a little farther, would have rendered this Continent the glory of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="014966_0052_0F954F3577D2F460">As Britain hath not manife&s;ted the lea&s;t inclination towards a compromi&s;e, we may be a&s;&s;ured that no terms can be obtained worthy the acceptance of the Continent, or any ways equal to the expence of blood and trea&s;ure we have been already put to.</P>
<P>The object contended for, ought always to bear &s;ome ju&s;t proportion to the expence. The removal of North, or the whole de|te&s;table junto, is a matter unworthy the millions we have expended. A temporary &s;toppage of trade was an inconvenience, which would have &s;ufficiently ballanced the repeal of all the acts complained off, had &s;uch repeals been obtained; but if the whole Continent mu&s;t take up arms, if every man mu&s;t be a &s;oldier, 'tis &s;carcely worth our while to fight again&s;t a contemptible mini&s;try only. Dearly, dearly, do we pay for the re|peal of the acts, if that is all we fight for; for in a ju&s;t e&s;timation, 'tis as great a folly to pay a Bunker-hill price for law as for land. As I have always con&s;idered the independancy of this Continent, as an event which &s;ooner or later mu&s;t arrive, &s;o from the late rapid progre&s;s of the Continent to maturity, the event could not be far off. Wherefore on the breaking out of ho&s;tilities, it was not worth
<PB N="47" REF="014966_0053_0F954F3749A4CFA0">
the while to have di&s;puted a matter, which time would have finally redre&s;&s;ed, unle&s;s we meant to be in earne&s;t: otherwi&s;e it is like wa&s;ting an e&s;tate on a &s;uit at law, to regu|late the tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of a tenant, who&s;e lea&s;e is ju&s;t expiring. No man was a warmer wi&s;her for reconciliation than my&s;elf, before the fatal 19th of April 1775, but the mo|ment the event of that day was made known, I rejected the hardened, &s;ullen tempered Pharoah of England for ever; and di&s;dain the wretch, that with the pretended title of FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE can unfeelingly hear of their &s;laughter, and compo&s;edly &s;leep with their blood upon his &s;oul.</P>
<P>But admitting that matters were now made up, what would be the event? I an|&s;wer, the ruin of the Continent. And that for &s;everal rea&s;ons&punc;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The powers of governing &s;till re|maining in the hands of the King, he will have a negative over the whole legi&s;lation of this Continent: and as he hath &s;hewn him|&s;elf &s;uch an inveterate enemy to liberty, and di&s;covered &s;uch a thir&s;t for arbitrary power; is he, or is he not, a proper man to &s;ay to the&s;e Colonies, <HI>You &s;hall make no laws but
<PB N="48" REF="014966_0054_0F954F37B72FEA18">
what I plea&s;e.</HI> And is there any inhabitant in America &s;o ignorant, as not to know, that according to what is called the <HI>pre&s;ent con&s;titution,</HI> that this Continent can make no laws but what the king gives leave to; and is there any man &s;o unwi&s;e, as not to &s;ee, that (con&s;idering what has happened) he will &s;uffer no laws to be made here, but &s;uch as &s;uit his purpo&s;e. We may be as effectually en&s;laved by the want of laws in America, as by &s;ubmitting to laws made for us in England. After matters are made up (as it is called) can there be any doubt, but the whole power of the crown will be exerted to keep this Continent as low and humble as po&s;&s;ible? in&s;tead of going for|ward, we &s;hall go backward, or be per|petually quarrelling or ridiculou&s;ly petion|ing. &mdash;We are already greater than the King wi&s;hes us to be, and will he not here|after endeavour to make us le&s;s. To bring the matter to one point, is the power who is jealous of our pro&s;perity, a proper power to govern us? Whoever &s;ays <HI>no</HI> to this que&s;tion is an <HI>Independant,</HI> for independency means no more than whether we &s;hall make our own laws, or, whether the King, the greate&s;t enemy this Continent hath, or can
<PB N="49" REF="014966_0055_0F954F387819C548">
have, &s;hall tell us, <HI>there &s;hall be no laws but &s;uch as I like.</HI></P>
<P>But the King you'll &s;ay, hath a negative in England; the people there can make no laws without his con&s;ent. In point of right and good order, there is &s;omething very ri|diculous that a youth of twenty-one (which hath often happened) &s;hall &s;ay to &s;ix mil|lions of people older and wi&s;er than him&s;elf, "I forbid this or that act of yours to be law." But in this place I decline this &s;ort of reply, though I will never cea&s;e to expo&s;e the ab|&s;urdity of it, and only an&s;wer that England being the King's re&s;idence, and America not &s;o, makes quite another ca&s;e. The King's negative here is ten times more dan|gerous and fatal than it can be in England, for there he will &s;carcely refu&s;e his con&s;ent to a bill for putting England into as &s;trong a &s;tate of defence as po&s;&s;ible, and here he would never &s;uffer &s;uch a bill to be pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>America is only a &s;econdary object in the &s;y&s;tem of Briti&s;h politics. England con&s;ults the good of this country, no farther, than it an&s;wers her own purpo&s;e. Wherefore her own intere&s;t leads her to &s;uppre&s;s the growth of ours in every ca&s;e which doth not promote
<PB N="50" REF="014966_0056_0F954F393644D280">
her advantage, or in the lea&s;t interferes with it. A pretty &s;tate we &s;hould &s;oon be in, under &s;uch a &s;econd hand government, con|&s;idering what has happened! Men do not change from enemies to friends by the alter|ation of a name: And in order to &s;hew that reconciliation now is a dangerous doctrine, I affirm, <HI>that it would be policy in the King at this time, to repeal the acts for the &s;ake of rein&s;tating him&s;elf in the government of the provinces</HI>; In order that HE MAY ACCOM|PLISH BY CRAFT AND SUBTILTY, IN THE LONG RUN, WHAT HE CANNOT DO BY FORCE AND VIOLENCE IN THE SHORT ONE. Reconciliation and ruin are nearly related.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>&mdash;That as even the be&s;t terms which we can expect to obtain, can amount to no more than a temporary expedient, or a kind of goverment by guardian&s;hip, which can la&s;t no longer than till the Colo|nies come of age, &s;o the general face and &s;tate of things in the interim will be un|&s;ettled and unpromi&s;&s;ing: Emigrants of pro|perty will not choo&s;e to come to a country who&s;e form of goverment hangs but by a thread, and who is every day tottering on the brink of commotion and di&s;turbance:
<PB N="51" REF="014966_0057_0F954F39F82D8010">
And numbers of the pre&s;ent inhabitants would lay hold of the interval to di&s;po&s;e of their effects, and quit the Continent.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t powerful of all arguments is, that nothing but independance i. e. a continental form of government, can keep the peace of the Continent and pre&s;erve it inviolate from civil wars. I dread the event of a reconciliation with Britain now, as it is more than probable, that it will be followed by a revolt &s;ome where or other, the con|&s;equences of which may be far more fatal than all the malice of Britain.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands are already ruined by Briti&s;h barbarity; (thou&s;ands more will probably &s;uffer the &s;ame fate;) Tho&s;e men have other feelings than us who having nothing &s;uffered. All they now po&s;&s;e&s;s is liberty, what they before enjoyed is &s;acrificed to its &s;ervice, and having nothing more to lo&s;e, they di&s;|dain &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides, the general tem|per of the Colonies towards a Briti&s;h govern|ment will be like that of a youth, who is nearly out of his time; they will care very little about her: And a government which cannot pre&s;erve the peace, is no government at all, and in that ca&s;e we pay our money
<PB N="52" REF="014966_0058_0F954F3AB74A9250">

I have heard &s;ome men &s;ay, many of whom I believe &s;poke without thinking, that they dreaded an independance, fearing that it would pro|duce civil wars: It is but &s;eldom that our fir&s;t thoughts are truly correct, and that is the ca&s;e here; for there are ten times more to dread from a patched up connection, than from independance. I make the &s;ufferers ca&s;e my own, and I prote&s;t, that were I driven from hou&s;e and home, my property de&s;troyed, and my circum&s;tances ruined, that as a man &s;en&s;ible of injuries, I could never reli&s;h the doctrine of reconciliation, or con&s;ider my&s;elf bound thereby.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE PRESENT ABILITY OF AMERICA, WITH SOME MISCELLANEOUS REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>I Have never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath not confe&s;&s;ed his opinion, that a &s;eparation between the countries, would take place one time or other: And there is no in|&s;tance, in which we have &s;hewn le&s;s judg|ment; than in endeavouring to de&s;cribe what we call, the ripene&s;s or fitne&s;s of the Continent for independance,</P>
<P>As all men allow the mea&s;ure, and vary only in their opinion of the time, let us in order to remove mi&s;takes, take a general &s;urvey of things, and endeavour if po&s;&s;ible, to find out the <HI>very</HI> time. But I need not go far, the enquiry cea&s;es at once, for, the <HI>time hath found us.</HI> The general con|currence, the glorious union of all things, prove the fact.</P>
<P>'Tis not in numbers but in unity that our great &s;trength lies: yet our pre&s;ent numbers are &s;ufficient to repel the force of all the world. The Continent hath at this time the large&s;t di&s;ciplined army of any
<PB N="62" REF="014966_0068_0F954F42F59DE808">
power under Heaven: and is ju&s;t arrived at that pitch of &s;trength, in which no &s;ingle Colony is able to &s;upport it&s;elf, and the whole, when united, is able to do any thing. Our land force is more than &s;ufficient, and as to Naval affairs, we cannot be in&s;en&s;ible that Britain would never &s;uffer an Ameri|can man of war to be built, while the Continent remained in her hands. Where|fore, we &s;hould be no forwarder an hundred years hence, in that branch than we are now; but the truth is we &s;hould be le&s;s &s;o, becau&s;e the timber of the Country is every day dimini&s;hing.</P>
<P>Were the Continent crouded with inha|bitants, her &s;ufferings under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances would be intolerable. The more &s;ea port Towns we had, the more &s;hould we have both to defend and to lo&s;e. Our pre&s;ent numbers are &s;o happily propor|tioned to our wants, that no man need be idle. The diminution of trade affords an army, and the nece&s;&s;ities of an army creates a new trade.</P>
<P>Debts we have none: and whatever we may contract on this account will &s;erve as a glorious memento of our virtue. Can we
<PB N="63" REF="014966_0069_0F954F43B9153090">
but leave po&s;terity with a &s;ettled form of government, an independant con&s;titution of it's own the purcha&s;e at any price will be cheap. But to expend millions for the &s;ake of getting a few vile acts repealed, and routing the pre&s;ent mini&s;try only, is un|worthy the charge, and is u&s;ing po&s;terity with the utmo&s;t cruelty; becau&s;e it is leaving them the great work to do and a debt upon their backs from which they derive no ad|vantage. Such a thought is unworthy a man of honour, and is the true characteri&s;|tic of a narrow heart and a pidling politi|cian.</P>
<P>The debt we may contract doth not de&s;erve our regard if the work be but accompli&s;hed. No nation ought to be without a debt. A national debt is a national bond: and when it bears no intere&s;t is in no ca&s;e a grievance. Britain is oppre&s;&s;ed with a debt of upwards of one hundred and forty millions &s;terling, for which &s;he pays upwards of four millions intere&s;t. And as a compen&s;ation for her debt, &s;he has a large navy; America is without a debt, and without a navy; but for the twentieth part of the Engil&s;h national debt, could have a navy as large again. The navy of England is not worth
<PB N="64" REF="014966_0070_0F954F4477E14470">
at this time more than three millions and an half &s;terling.</P>
<P>No country on the globe is &s;o happily &s;ituated, or &s;o internally capable of rai&s;ing a fleet as America. Tar, timber, iron, and cordage are her natural produce. We need go abroad for nothing. Whereas the Dutch, who make large profits by hiring out their &s;hips of war to the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, are obliged to import mo&s;t of the materials they u&s;e. We ought to view the building a fleet as an article of commerce, it being the natural manufactory of this country. 'Tis the be&s;t money we can lay out. A navy when fini&s;hed is worth more than it co&s;t: And is that nice point in national policy, in which commerce and protection are united. Let us build; if we want them not, we can &s;ell; and by that means re|place our paper currency with ready gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>In point of manning a fleet, people in general run into great errors; it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary that one fourth part &s;hould be &s;ailors. The Terrible Privateer, Capt. Death, &s;tood the hotte&s;t engagement of any &s;hip la&s;t war, yet had not twenty &s;ailors on board,
<PB N="65" REF="014966_0071_0F954F45359EDE20">
though her complement of men was up|wards of two hundred. A few able and &s;ocial &s;ailors will &s;oon in&s;truct a &s;ufficient number of active landmen in the common work of a &s;hip. Wherefore we never can be more capable to begin on maritime mat|ters than now, while our timber is &s;tanding, our fi&s;heries blocked up, and our &s;ailors and &s;hipwrights out of employ. Men of war, of &s;eventy and eighty guns were built forty years ago in New England, and why not the &s;ame now? Ship building is Ame|rica's greate&s;t pride, and in which, &s;he will in time excel the whole world. The great empires of the ea&s;t are mo&s;tly inland, and con&s;equently excluded from the po&s;&s;ibility of rivalling her. Africa is in a &s;tate of barbari&s;m; and no power in Europe, hath either &s;uch an extent of coa&s;t, or &s;uch an internal &s;upply of materials. Where nature hath given the one, &s;he has with-held the other; to America only hath &s;he been li|beral of both. The va&s;t empire of Ru&s;&s;ia is almo&s;t &s;hut out from the &s;ea; wherefore, her boundle&s;s forre&s;ts, her tar, iron, and cordage are only articles of commerce.</P>
<P>In point of &s;afety, ought we to be with|out a fleet? We are not the little people
<PB N="66" REF="014966_0072_0F954F45F6F83078">
now, which we were &s;ixty years ago, at that time we might have tru&s;ted our pro|perty in the &s;treets, or fields rather, and &s;lept &s;ecurely without locks or bolts to our doors and windows The ca&s;e now is alter|ed, and our methods of defence, ought to improve with our increa&s;e of property. A common pirate, twelve months ago, might have come up the Delaware, and laid the city of Philadelphia under in&s;tant Contribu|tion for what &s;um he plea&s;ed; and the &s;ame might have happened to other places. Nay, any daring fellow in a brig of 14 or 16 guns might have robbed the whole Continent, and carried off half a million of money. The&s;e are circum&s;tances which demand our attention and point out the nece&s;&s;ity of naval protection.</P>
<P>Some perhaps will &s;ay, that after we have made it up with Britain that &s;he will protect us. Can we be &s;o unwi&s;e as to mean that &s;he &s;hall keep a navy in our Harbours for that purpo&s;e? Common &s;en&s;e will tell us, that the power which hath endeavoured to &s;ubdue us, is of all others, the mo&s;t im|proper to defend us. Conque&s;t may be ef|fected under the pretence of friend&s;hip; and our&s;elves, after a long and brave re&s;i&s;t|ance,
<PB N="67" REF="014966_0073_0F954F47C44304C8">
be at la&s;t cheated into &s;lavery. And if her &s;hips are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would a&s;k, how is &s;he to protect us? A navy three or four thou&s;and miles off can be of little u&s;e, and on &s;udden emergencies, none at all. Wherefore if we mu&s;t hereafter protect our&s;elves, why not do it for our&s;elves? why do it for another?</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h li&s;t of &s;hips of war, is long and formidable, but not a tenth part of them are at any one time fit for &s;ervice, numbers of them not in being; yet their names are pompou&s;ly continued in the li&s;t if only a plank is left of the &s;hip: and not a fifth part of &s;uch as are fit for &s;ervice, can be &s;pared on any one &s;tation at one time. The Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, Mediterranean, Africa, and other parts over which Britain extends her claim, make large demands upon her navy. From a mixture of pre|judice and innatention, we have contracted a fal&s;e notion re&s;pecting the navy of England, and have talked as if we &s;hould have the whole of it to encounter at once, and for that rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;ed, that we mu&s;t have one as large; which not being in&s;tantly practicable, have been made u&s;e of by a &s;et of di&s;gui&s;ed tories to di&s;courage our be|ginning
<PB N="68" REF="014966_0074_0F954F4837B89278">
thereon. Nothing can be farther from truth and this, for if America had only a twentieth part of the naval force of Britain, &s;he would be by far an over match for her; becau&s;e as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our whole force would be employed on our own coa&s;t, where we &s;hould, in the long run, have two to one the advantage of tho&s;e who had three or four thou&s;and miles to &s;ail over, before they could attack us, and the &s;ame di&s;t|ance to return in order to refit and recruit. And although Britain by her fleet hath a check over our trade to Europe, we have as large a one over her trade to the We&s;t Indies, which by laying in the neighbourhood of the Continent lies entirely at its mercy.</P>
<P>Some method might be fallen on to keep up a naval force in time of peace, if we &s;hould not judge it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport a con&s;tant navy. If premiums were to be given to merchants to build and employ in their &s;ervice, &s;hips mounted with 20 30, 40, or 50 guns (the premiums to be in proportion to the lo&s;s of bulk to the mer|chant) fifty or &s;ixty of tho&s;e &s;hips, with a few guard &s;hips on con&s;tant duty would keep up a &s;ufficient navy, and that without bur|dening
<PB N="69" REF="014966_0075_0F954F48F6969C00">
our&s;elves with the evil &s;o loudly complained of in England, of &s;uffering their fleets in time of peace to lie rotting in the docks. To unite the &s;inews of commerce and defence is &s;ound policy; for when our &s;trength and our riches, play into each o|ther's hand, we need fear no external ene|my.</P>
<P>In almo&s;t every article of defence we abound. Hemp flouri&s;hes even to rankne&s;s, &s;o that we need not want cordage. Our iron is &s;uperior to that of other countries. Our &s;mall arms equal to any in the world. Cannon we can ca&s;t at plea&s;ure. Salt-petre and gun powder we are every day produc|ing. Our knowledge is hourly improving. Re&s;olution is our inherent character, and courage hath never yet for&s;aken us. Where|fore, what is it that we want? why is it that we he&s;itate? From Britain we can expect nothing but ruin. If &s;he is once admitted to the government of America again, this Continent will not be worth living in. Jea|lou&s;ies will be always ari&s;ing; in&s;urrections will be con&s;tantly happening; and who will go forth to quell them? who will venture his life to reduce his own countrymen to a fo|reign obedience? the difference between

Penn&s;ylvania and Connecticut, re&s;pecting &s;ome unlocated lands, &s;hews the in&s;ignifi|cance of a Briti&s;h government, and fully proves, that nothing but Continental au|thority can regulate Continental matters.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on why the pre&s;ent time is preferable to all others, is, that the fewer our numbers are, the more land there is yet unoccupied, which in&s;tead of being lavi&s;h|ed by the king on his worthle&s;s depen|dants, may be hereafter applied, not only to the di&s;charge of the pre&s;ent debt, but to the con&s;tant &s;upport of government. No nation under Heaven hath &s;uch an advan|tage as this.</P>
<P>The infant &s;tate of the Colonies, as it is called, &s;o far from being again&s;t, is an ar|gument in favour of independance. We are &s;ufficiently numerous, and were we more &s;o, we might be le&s;s united. 'Tis a matter worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the more a country is peopled, the &s;maller their ar|mies are. In military numbers the ancients far exceeded the moderns: and the rea&s;on is evident, for trade being the con&s;equence of population, men become too much absorb|ed thereby to attend to any thing el&s;e.

<P>Youth is the &s;eed time of good habits as well in nations as in individuals. It might be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible to form the Continent into one Government half a cen|tury hence. The va&s;t variety of intere&s;ts occa&s;ioned by an increa&s;e of trade and po|pulation would create confu&s;ion, Colony would be again&s;t Colony. Each being able would &s;corn each others a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and while the proud and fooli&s;h gloried in their little di&s;tinctions, the wi&s;e would lament that the union had not been formed before. Wherefore, the pre&s;ent time is the true time for e&s;tabli&s;hing it. The intimacy which is contracted in infancy, and the friend&s;hip
<PB N="72" REF="014966_0078_0F954F4B3678C748">
which is formed in misfortune, are of all others, the mo&s;t la&s;ting and unalterable. Our pre&s;ent union is marked with both the&s;e characters: we are young, and we have been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; but our concord hath with&s;tood our troubles, and fixes a memorable Aera for po&s;terity to glory in.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent time likewi&s;e, is that pecu|liar time, which never happens to a nation but once, viz. the time of forming it&s;elf into a government. Mo&s;t nations have let &s;lip the opportunity, and by that means have been compelled to receive laws from their conquerors, in&s;tead of making laws for them|&s;elves. Fir&s;t they had a king, and then a form of government; whereas the articles or charter of government &s;hould be formed fir&s;t, and men delegated to execute them afterward: but from the errors of other na|tions, let us learn wi&s;dom, and lay hold of the pre&s;ent opportunity&mdash;<HI>To begin government at the right end.</HI></P>
<P>When William the Conqueror &s;ubdued England, he gave them law at the point of the &s;word; and until we con&s;ent that the &s;eat of government in America be legally and authoritatively occupied; we &s;hall be in
<PB N="73" REF="014966_0079_0F954F4BF86DC918">
danger of having it filled by &s;ome fortunate ruffian, who may treat us in the &s;ame man|ner, and then, where will be our freedom? where our property.</P>
<P>As to religion, I hold it to be the indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty of government, to protect all con&s;cientious profe&s;&s;ors thereof, and I know of no other bu&s;ine&s;s which government hath to do therewith: let a man throw a&s;ide that narrowne&s;s of &s;oul, that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of principle, which the niggards of all profe&s;|&s;ions are &s;o unwilling to part with, and he will be delivered of his fears on that head. Su&s;picion is the companion of mean &s;ouls and the bane of all good &s;ociety. For my&s;elf, I fully and con&s;cientiou&s;ly believe, that it is the will of the Almighty, that there &s;hould be diver&s;ity of religious opinions among us. It affords a larger field for our Chri&s;tian kindne&s;s: were we all of one way of thinking, our religious di&s;po&s;itions would want matter for probation: and on this liberal principle I look on the various denominations among us, to be like children of the &s;ame family differing only in what is called their Chri&s;tian names.</P>
<P>In page 54 I threw out a few thoughts on the propriety of a Continental charter,
<PB N="74" REF="014966_0080_0F954F4CC404F9F8">
(for I only pre&s;ume to offer hints, not plans,) and in this place I take the liberty of re-mentioning the &s;ubject, by ob&s;erving, that a charter is to be under&s;tood as a bond of &s;olemn obligation, which the whole enters into, to &s;upport the right of every &s;eparate part, whether of religion, per&s;onal freedom, or property. A right reckoning makes long friends.</P>
<P>In a former page, I likewi&s;e mention|ed the nece&s;&s;ity of a large and equal re|pre&s;entation; and there is no political mat|ter which more de&s;erves our attention. A &s;mall number of electors, or a &s;mall number of repre&s;entatives, are equally dangerous. But if the number of the repre&s;entatives be not only &s;mall, but unequal, the danger is encrea&s;ed. As an in&s;tance of this I menti|on the following; when the petition of the a&s;&s;ociators was before the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, twenty eight members only were pre&s;ent. All the Bucks county mem|bers, being eight, voted again&s;t it, and had &s;even of the Che&s;ter members done the &s;ame, this whole Province had been govern|ed by two counties only, and this danger it is always expo&s;ed to. The unwarrantable
<PB N="75" REF="014966_0081_0F954F4D77630BF0">
&s;tretch likewi&s;e, which that hou&s;e made in their la&s;t &s;itting, to gain an undue authority over the Delegates of that Province, ought to warn the people at large, how they tru&s;t power out of their own hands. A &s;et of in&s;tructions for the Delegates were put to|gether; which in point of &s;en&s;e and bu&s;i|ne&s;s would have di&s;honoured a &s;chool-boy, and after being approved by a few, a very few without doors, were carried into the hou&s;e, and there pa&s;&s;ed <HI>in behalf of the whole Colony</HI>: whereas did the whole Colony know, with what ill-will that hou&s;e hath entered on &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary public mea&s;ures, they would not he&s;itate a moment to think them unworthy of &s;uch a tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Immediate nece&s;&s;ity makes many things convenient, which if continued would grow into oppre&s;&s;ions. Expedience and right, are different things. When the calamities of America required a con&s;ultation, there was no method &s;o ready, or at that time &s;o proper, as to appoint per&s;ons from the &s;e|veral hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly for that purpo&s;e; and the wi&s;dom with which they have pro|ceeded hath pre&s;erved this Continent from ruin. But as it is more than probable that we &s;hall never be without a CONGRESS,
<PB N="76" REF="014966_0082_0F954F4F43CBDCE0">
every well wi&s;her to good order, mu&s;t own, that the mode for choo&s;ing members of that body, de&s;erves con&s;ideration. And I put it as a que&s;tion to tho&s;e, who make a &s;tudy of mankind, whether repre&s;entation and election is not too great a power for one and the &s;ame body of men to po&s;&s;e&s;s? When we are planning for po&s;terity. we ought to remember, that virtue is not hereditary.</P>
<P>It is from our enemies that we often gain excellent maxims, and are frequently &s;ur|pri&s;ed into rea&s;on by their mi&s;takes. Mr. Cornwall (one of the Lords of the Trea&s;ury) treated the petition of the New York A&s;|&s;embly with contempt, becau&s;e that hou&s;e he &s;aid con&s;i&s;ted but of twenty &s;ix mem|bers, which, trifling number he argued could not with decency be put for the whole. We thank him for his involuntary hone&s;ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who would fully under&s;tand of what great con|&s;equence a large and equal repre&s;entation is to a State, &s;hould read Burgh's Political Di&s;qui&s;itions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE, however &s;trange it may appear to &s;ome, or however unwilling they may be to think &s;o, matters not,
<PB N="77" REF="014966_0083_0F954F4FB82D4960">
but many &s;trong and &s;triking rea&s;ons may be given to &s;hew, that nothing can &s;ettle our affairs &s;o expeditiou&s;ly as an open and determined declaration for independance. Some of which are,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI>&mdash;It is the cu&s;tom of Nations when any two are at war, for &s;ome other powers not engaged in the quarrel, to &s;tep in as mediators and bring about the preliminaries of a peace: But while America calls her|&s;elf the &s;ubject of Great Britain, no power however well di&s;po&s;ed &s;he may be, can offer her mediation. Wherefore in our pre&s;ent &s;tate we may quarrel on for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>&mdash;It is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that France or Spain will give us any kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if we mean only to make u&s;e of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for the purpo&s;e of re|pairing the breach, and &s;trengthening the connection between Britain and America; becau&s;e, tho&s;e powers would be &s;ufferers by the con&s;equences.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>&mdash;While we profe&s;s our&s;elves the &s;ubjects of Britain, we mu&s;t in the eye of foreign nations be con&s;idered as Rebels. The precedent is &s;ome-what dangerous to
<PB N="78" REF="014966_0084_0F954F5076749510">
their peace, for men to be in arms under the name of &s;ubjects: we on the &s;pot can &s;olve the paradox; but to unite re&s;i&s;tance and &s;ubjection, requires an idea much too refined for common under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>&mdash;Were a manife&s;to to be pub|li&s;hed and di&s;patched to foreign Counts, &s;etting forth the mi&s;eries we have endured, and the peaceable methods we have ineffec|tually u&s;ed for redre&s;s, declaring at the &s;ame time, that not being able any longer to live happily or &s;afely, under the cruel di&s;po&s;ition of the Briti&s;h Court, we had been driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of breaking off all connections with her; at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;uring all &s;uch Courts, of our peaceable di&s;po&s;ition towards them, and of our de&s;ire of entering into trade with them: &s;uch a memorial would produce more good effects to this Continent, than if a &s;hip were freight|ed with petitions to Britain.</P>
<P>Under our pre&s;ent denomination of Briti&s;h Subjects, we can neither be received nor heard abroad: the cu&s;tom of all Courts is again&s;t us, and will be &s;o, until by an independance we take rank with other nations.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="014966_0085_0F954F5136D260C8">The&s;e proceedings may at fir&s;t appear &s;trange and difficult, but like all other &s;teps which we have already pa&s;&s;ed over, will in a little time become familiar and agreeable: and until an independance is declared, the Continent will feel it&s;elf like a man who continues putting off &s;ome un|plea&s;ant bu&s;ine&s;s from day to day, yet knows it mu&s;t be done, hates to &s;et about it, wi&s;hes it over, and is continually haunted with the thoughts of its nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>ADDITIONS TO COMMON SENSE. <HI>AMERICAN INDEPENDANCY</HI> defended.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the little pamphlet intitled COMMON SENSE fir&s;t made its appearance in favor of that &s;o often abjured idea of independance upon Great-Britain, I was informed that no le&s;s than three gentlemen of re&s;pectable abilities were engaged to an&s;wer it. As yet I have &s;een nothing which directly pretends to di&s;pute a &s;ingle po&s;ition of the author. The oblique e&s;&s;ay in Humphreys's paper, and &s;olemn Te&s;timony of the Quakers, however intend|ed, having offered nothing to the purpo&s;e, I &s;hall take leave to examine this important que&s;tion, with all candor and attention, and &s;ubmit the re&s;ult to my much intere&s;ted country.</P>
<P>Dependance of one man, or &s;tate, upon another is either ab&s;olute, or limited by &s;ome certain terms of agreement. The
<PB N="82" REF="014966_0090_0F97D968AF183A88">
dependance of the&s;e colonies which Great Britain calls <HI>con&s;titutional,</HI> as declared by act of Parliament, is ab&s;olute. If the contrary of this be the bugbear &s;o many have been declaiming again&s;t, I could wi&s;h my coun|trymen would con&s;ider the con&s;equence of &s;o &s;tupid a profe&s;&s;ion. If a limited depen|dance is intended, I would be much obliged to any one who will &s;hew me the <HI>Britanno-American Magna Charta</HI> wherein the terms of our limited dependance are preci&s;ely &s;tated. If no &s;uch thing can be found, and <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> dependance be accounted inadm&s;&s;i|ble, the &s;ound we are &s;quabbling about has certainly no determinate meaning. If any &s;ay we mean that kind of dependance we acknowledged at and before the year 1763; I an&s;wer, <HI>vague and uncertain laws, and more e&s;pecially</HI> CONSTITUTIONS, are the very in|&s;truments of &s;lavery. The Magna Charta of England was very explicit, con&s;idering the time it was formed, and yet much blood was &s;pilt in di&s;putes concerning its meaning.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the danger of an indefinite de|pendance upon an undetermined power, it might be worth while to con&s;ider what the characters are on whom we are &s;o ready to acknowledge our&s;elves dependant. The vo|taries
<PB N="83" REF="014966_0091_0F954F5377867E28">
for this idol tell us, upon the good people of our Mother Country, whom they repre&s;ent as the mo&s;t ju&s;t, humane, and af|fectionate friends we can have in the world. Were this true, it were &s;ome encourage|ment; but who can pretend ignorance that the&s;e ju&s;t and humane friends are as much under the tyranny of men of a rever&s;e cha|racter as we &s;hould be, could tho&s;e mi&s;cre|ants gain their ends? I di&s;claim any more than a mutual dependance on any man, or number of men upon earth; but an indefi|nite dependance upon a combination of men, who have, in the face of the &s;un, broken thro' the mo&s;t &s;olemn covenants, de|bauched the hereditary, and corrupted the elective guardians of the people's rights, who have, in fact, e&s;tabli&s;hed an ab&s;olute tyranny in Great-Britain and Ireland, and openly declared them&s;elves <HI>competent to bind the Coloni&s;ts in all ca&s;es what&s;oever:</HI> I &s;ay in|definite dependance on &s;uch a combination of <HI>u&s;urping innovators</HI> is evidently as dan|gerous to liberty, as fatal to civil and &s;ocial happine&s;s, as any one &s;tep that could be pro|po&s;ed, even by the <HI>de&s;troyer of men.</HI> The utmo&s;t that the hone&s;t party in Great-Britain can do, is to warn us to avoid this depen|dance at all hazards! Does not even a Duke of Grafton declare the mini&s;terial mea&s;ures
<PB N="84" REF="014966_0092_0F97D96971AF3918">
illegal and dangerous? And &s;hall America, no way connected with this admini&s;tration, pre&s;s our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch mea&s;ures, and reconciliation to the authors of them? Would not &s;uch pigeon-hearted wretches equally forward the recal of the Stuart fa|mily, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Popery throughout Chri&s;tendom, did they conceive the party in favor of tho&s;e loyal mea&s;ures the &s;tronge&s;t? Shame on the men who can court exemption from pre&s;ent trouble and expence, at the price of their own and po&s;|terity's liberty! The hone&s;t party in Eng|land cannot wi&s;h for the reconciliation pro|po&s;ed. It is as un&s;afe to them as to us, and they thoroughly apprehend it. What check have they now upon the crown, and what &s;hadow of control can they pretend, when the crown can command fifteen or twenty millions a year, which they have no|thing to &s;ay to? A proper proportion of our commerce is all that can benefit any good man in Britain or Ireland, and God forbid we &s;hould be &s;o cruel as to furni&s;h bad men with power to en&s;lave both Britain and Ame|rica. Admini&s;tration has now fairly di&s;&s;e|vered the dangerous tie: Execrated will he be by the late&s;t po&s;terity who again joins the fatal cord! But &s;ay the puling pu&s;illanimous cowards, we &s;hall be &s;ubject to a long and
<PB N="85" REF="014966_0093_0F954F5437700FF8">
bloody war, if we declare independance. On the contrary, I affirm it the only &s;tep that can bring the conte&s;t to a &s;peedy and happy i&s;&s;ue. By declaring independance we place our&s;elves on a footing for an equal ne|gociation: Now we are called a pack of villainous rebels, who, like the St. Vin|cent Indians, can expect nothing more than a pardon for our lives, and the &s;overeign fa|vor, re&s;pecting freedom and property, <HI>to be at the King's will.</HI> Grant Almighty God that I may be numbered with the dead be|fore that &s;able day dawn on North-Ame|rica!</P>
<P>All Europe knows the illegal and inhu|man treatment we have received from Bri|tons. All Europe wi&s;hes the haughty em|pre&s;s of the main reduced to a more hum|ble deportment. After her&s;elf has thru&s;t her Colonies from her, the maritime pow|ers cannot be &s;uch idiots as to &s;uffer her to reduce them to a more ab&s;olute obedience of her dictates than they were heretofore obliged to yield. Does not the mo&s;t &s;uper|ficial politician know that while we profe&s;s our&s;elves the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, and yet hold arms again&s;t her, they have a right to treat us as rebels, and that according to the laws of nature and nations no other
<PB N="86" REF="014966_0095_0F97D96BEA9FC610">
&s;tate has a right to interfere in the di&s;pute? But on the other hand, on our declaration of independance, the maritime &s;tates at lea&s;t will find it their intere&s;t, which always &s;e|cures the que&s;tion of inclination, to protect a people who can be &s;o advantageous to them. So that tho&s;e &s;hort-&s;ighted politici|ans, who conclude that this &s;tep will involve us in &s;laughter and deva&s;tation, may plainly perceive that no mea&s;ure in our power will &s;o naturally and effectually work our deliver|ance. The motion of a finger of the Grand Monarch would procure as gentle a temper in the Omnipotent Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter as ap|peared in the Manilla ran&s;om and Falkland i&s;lands affairs. From without certainly we have every thing to hope, nothing to fear; from within, &s;ome tell us the Pre&s;byterians, if freed from the re&s;training power of Great-Britain, would over-run the peaceable Qua|kers in this government. For my own part, I de&s;pi&s;e and dete&s;t the bickerings of &s;ecta|ries, and am apprehen&s;ive of no trouble from that quarter, e&s;pecially while no pe|culiar honors nor emoluments are annexed to either. I heartily wi&s;h too many of the Quakers did not give cau&s;e of complaint, by endeavoring to counteract the mea&s;ures of their fellow citizens for the common &s;afety. If they profe&s;s them&s;elves only pilgrims
<PB N="87" REF="014966_0094_0F954F54F876F8A8">
here, let them walk through the men of this world without interfering with their actions on either &s;ide. If they would not <HI>pull down Kings,</HI> let them not <HI>&s;upport tyrants</HI>; for whe|ther they under&s;tand it or not, there is, and ever has been, an e&s;&s;ential difference in the characters.</P>
<P>Finally, with M.

<HEAD>ADDITIONS TO COMMON SENSE. The Propriety of <HI>INDEPENDANCY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO acknowledge that the Creator form|ed Man for &s;ociety, and that &s;ociety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without regulations, laws, and government; and at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;ert, that in &s;pight of all human care to prevent it, every government will degenerate into a tyranny, is &s;uch a daring <HI>bla&s;phemy</HI> of the <HI>divine attributes,</HI> that had I not heard it a&s;&s;erted, and acquie&s;ced in as a truth, I could not have believed &s;uch a po&s;ition could have obtained in a civilized country! This mon&s;trous hypothe&s;is con|cludes that notwith&s;tanding the Deity had power enough to form &s;uch admirable crea|tures as men and women, and fit them for enjoying of each other a thou&s;and ways, and tho' by means of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite of tho&s;e enjoyments a race &s;hould ari&s;e from them over which every power of rightful government mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be exerci&s;ed, yet ju&s;t and rightful government is in reali|ty utopian, imaginary, and impracticable!

Did not God cloath the gra&s;s direct the wild Goat and provide for the Sparrow, I might more ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded to &s;u&s;pect his care of Man.</P>
<P>I readily grant that the delegates of go|vernmental power are too apt to con&s;ider them&s;elves the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it <HI>in their own right,</HI> and that they therefore take every means in their power to become the <HI>ma&s;ters</HI> in place of <HI>&s;ervants</HI> to their <HI>con&s;titu|ents</HI>; and that the people in all civilized countries have been too inattentive to the u&s;urpations of their rulers: But I conceive of no cau&s;e in the nature of things which &s;o ab&s;olutely counteracts the power of a wi&s;e, learned, and free community as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for them to pre&s;erve their li|berty. The arguments brought from the condition of other &s;tates, are by no means conclu&s;ive with re&s;pect to the North-Ame|rican colonies. I am bold to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch a favourable combination of circum|&s;tances as they are ble&s;&s;ed with at this im|portant conjuncture, never did take place among any people with whom hi&s;tory has made us acquainted. The mo&s;t ju&s;t and &s;o|lid foundation of &s;ocial happine&s;s was laid in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Continent, <HI>the

cultivation of the earth for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of its proprietor.</HI> Here was no feudal tenure from &s;ome military Lord; every cultivator being the lord of his own &s;oil, and content with its produce, had no thoughts of en|croaching upon and &s;ubjecting his neigh|bour to his ab&s;olute dominion. Hence a hand&s;ome competency has enabled the bulk of the people to give their children &s;uch education as enables them to read, and be|come acquainted with the u&s;urpations of the deepe&s;t plotters of their ruin. The &s;pirit of the people for obtaining this nece&s;&s;ary in|formation, is evident from the incredible number of news-papers and other periodical publications which they encourage, and the effect of &s;uch in&s;titutions never have been &s;o great in any community, yet known, as in the&s;e <HI>pantaplebean (altogether</HI> Commons) colonies. How quickly the mo&s;t important revolution of the fundamentals of our po|licy can pervade a continent, may be gue&s;&s;|ed at by the progre&s;s of the idea of Coloni|al Independancy in three weeks or a month at farthe&s;t!

chain, which remaining, in any &s;hape whatever, tho' modified by all the wi&s;|dom and caution of the greate&s;t men now living, mu&s;t in a very little time drag the colonies into the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery. Many profe&s;s them&s;elves zealous for the liberties of America, yet declare an abhorrence of the idea of independancy on Great-Britain. If this be not a &s;oleci&s;m, as ab&s;urd and ir|reconcileable as ever was obtruded on man|kind, I know not the meaning of the term! <HI>Civil Liberty</HI> never was defined in &s;tricter terms than <HI>an</HI> EXEMPTION <HI>from all controul,</HI> WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY, <HI>in which eve|ry qualified member has an equal voice.</HI> No American, as &s;uch, has the &s;hadow of in|corporation with the government of Great-Britain; and in con&s;equence, if he receives the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;yllable of law from that quarter, he gives up his claim to the definitive ex|emption. If the &s;ticklers for <HI>dependance</HI> do not mean dependance for &s;ome certain laws, in the forming of which the Coloni&s;ts have no voice at all, I do not yet under&s;tand them; and if they do mean that we &s;hould admit the <HI>claim</HI> of any &s;tate, or any part of the power of any &s;tate, with which the de|mocratic power of this &s;tate is not incorpo|rated, to give us law <HI>in any ca&s;e whatever,</HI>

<P>Again, Mr. Hume's ob&s;ervation, [<HI>Perfect Commnowealth,</HI> p. 301.] that "the &s;word being in the hands of a &s;ingle per&s;on who will <HI>always neglect to di&s;cipline the militia,</HI> in order to have the pretext to <HI>keep up a &s;tanding army</HI>;" and the &s;ucceeding one, "that this is a <HI>mortal di&s;temper</HI> in the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> government of which it <HI>mu&s;t, at la&s;t, inevitably peri&s;h,</HI>" now &s;o fatally confirmed, may be a &s;ufficient warning to the Colonies to <HI>beware of being again entangled with the yoke of bondage.</HI></P>
<P>Many object to a Republican Govern|ment as impracticable in a large &s;tate. "The contrary of this (&s;ays Hume, [<HI>Per. Com.</HI> 302.] &s;eems evident. Though 'tis more difficult to form a Republican Government

In a large government which is modelled with ma&s;terly &s;kill, there is compa&s;s and room enough to refine the democracy from the lower people, who may be admitted into the fir&s;t elections, or fir&s;t concoction of the commonwealth; to the higher magi&s;trates who direct all the motions.

<HEAD>A Review of the American Conte&s;t, with &s;ome <HI>STRICTURES ON</HI> the <HI>KING's</HI> &s;peech, and its con&s;equences. <HI>ADDRESSED</HI> to all <HI>PARENTS</HI> in the <HI>THIRTEEN UNITED COLONIES.</HI> By a Friend to Po&s;terity and Mankind.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE in&s;tructs the brute creation to provide for, guard and protect their offspring until they are able to do for them&s;elves. The dam is never known to for&s;ake her young while her care is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;afety, nor to do any thing which would involve them in di&s;tre&s;s and difficulty. Man, who has this principle in common with brutes, is endowed with others yet more valuable, but which to him are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, whereby he is taught to provide for the future welfare of his de&s;cendants and to guard them from the encroachments of that power which civil &s;ociety con&s;titutes for its own &s;afety; but which, through the depravity of human nature is often turned again&s;t it. There are few parents who do not make it their con|&s;tant &s;tudy and earne&s;t endeavour to leave &s;ome valuable inheritance to their children:
<PB N="96" REF="014966_0104_0F954E8B397FAE48">
few who have been &s;o lo&s;t to the feelings of nature and calls of parental affection, as to entail difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s on their children, when it was in their power to leave them a a fair and ea&s;y inheritance. And yet it has &s;o happened, that by an ill timed attach|ment to the pre&s;ent, without paying proper attention to the future, they have entailed mi&s;ery upon them by the very means which were de&s;igned to pre&s;erve them from it.</P>
<P>It is now in your power to bequeath to your children the one or the other, and it becomes you to have an eye to them in all your proceedings. It is &s;ufficiently known to you, that riches in arbitrary &s;tates are often the ruin of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and that &s;ecurity to property is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tamp their true value on wealth and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions. He therefore, who wi&s;hes to leave his children in flouri&s;hing circum&s;tanc|es ought to be a zealous friend to tho&s;e mea|&s;ures, and that plan of government which gives the greate&s;t &s;ecurity to property, and an active warm opppo&s;er of tho&s;e which leave it to the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of men, who find a greater advantage in making free with what does not belong to them, than in frugally u&s;ing what is ju&s;tly their

own. Whig and Tory &s;hould be out of the que&s;tion. Private pique, party faction and animo&s;ity ought to &s;ub&s;ide. He who thinks &s;hould think for po&s;terity, and he who acts &s;hould act for his children.</P>
<P>It is a great weakne&s;s to &s;uffer our pa&s;|&s;ions to take place of our rea&s;on and blind|ly to follow their dictates, though to our manife&s;t hurt, rather than &s;ubject them to our better &s;en&s;e. A fal&s;e pride, which will not acknowledge an error though ever &s;o evident, an ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in our own opinion without deigning to hear ad|vice or in&s;truction, and an unrea&s;onable at|tachment to party, have done much mi&s;chief to mankind, and may yet do more if not carefully avoided. I have directed this pa|per to you in preference to others, becau&s;e your parental affection &s;hould form more than a counterpoi&s;e to every fal&s;e principle, which can influence the human mind where the intere&s;t of your offspring is at &s;take.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent conte&s;t is immen&s;ely great, and every man mu&s;t &s;ee that it will affect po&s;terity. Its con&s;equences cannot end with it&s;elf; but the late&s;t generations mu&s;t feel its effects. The great Ruler of the univer&s;e
<PB N="98" REF="014966_0106_0F954E8BFA035180">
has permitted it for wi&s;e purpo&s;es, and has called every one of us to act our part in it. It becomes us, therefore, laying a&s;ide all former prejudices, partiality and party at|tachments, to act upon principles which will ju&s;tify us to him who has a&s;&s;igned us our &s;tations, and cau&s;e po&s;terity to ble&s;s the me|mory of their forefathers. We all agree in this, that Great-Britain is unju&s;t and arbi|trary, and we have hitherto principally dif|fered in the mode of oppo&s;ition, which ought to have been pur&s;ued. I &s;peak not to tho&s;e who think one way and talk another. They act upon &s;uch ba&s;e principles, that it is in vain to attempt to rouze in them any ju&s;t or generous &s;entiments. We have no in|&s;tance of the conver&s;ion of avaricious or am|bitious hypocrites, and it would be wa&s;ting time to u&s;e arguments to convince them, I direct my&s;elf to you who have &s;incerity &s;uf|ficient to examine the principles on which you proceed, and hone&s;ty enough to pur&s;ue that cour&s;e of conduct which appears to be right, and &s;o much affection for your chil|dren as to prefer their intere&s;t and happine&s;s to every other con&s;ideration. For you I mean to throw together a few hints which may a&s;&s;i&s;t you in finally fixing a right choice.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="014966_0107_0F954E85F89A95D8">The Briti&s;h admini&s;tration began its at|tacks on our liberties with a Stamp act, but meeting with &s;trong oppo&s;ition they thought fit to repeal it. This act threw the colonies into &s;trong convul&s;ions, and we rejoiced ex|ceedingly on its repeal, and fondly hoped that we would enjoy future tranquillity. But we were mi&s;taken. They never intend|ed to relinqui&s;h the de&s;ign, but only to change their ground, that which they fir&s;t pitched upon not &s;eeming tenable. An Ame|rican revenue granted by a Briti&s;h Parlia|ment was the object, and they never lo&s;t &s;ight of it; for they &s;oon renewed their at|tacks upon principles which they thought more favourable to their intentions; but meeting with as little &s;ucce&s;s in that, as in the preceding attempt, they &s;u&s;pended their mea&s;ures for a time, in hopes of lulling us into a carele&s;s &s;ecurity. They accordingly once more returned to the charge, and en|deavoured to effect by cunning and artifice what they had heretofore attempted in vain on every other peaceable plan. This not &s;uccceding, they were reduced to their la&s;t &s;hift of bullying and force; and this they re&s;olved upon. They levied armies, ap|pointed Generals of reputation to command, and &s;ent them among&s;t us, we may know
<PB N="100" REF="014966_0108_0F954E8EB8853D00">
their commi&s;&s;ion by their conduct; for after abu&s;ing, brow-beating and in&s;ulting, after &s;tarving and tarring and feathering, after of|fering every po&s;&s;ible injury which a free people could bear, without obtaining their ends, and every other mea&s;ure failing, they drew the &s;word, and at once reduced us to the dire alternative of &s;ubmitting to their il|legal claims of juri&s;diction, or entering into the bloody conte&s;t. Like men determined to be free we cho&s;e the latter. It now re&s;ts on the la&s;t argument, an argument which finally &s;ettles all controver&s;ies of a like na|ture. The plan of operation is now open|ed, and they who &s;tand to it with the mo&s;t &s;teady per&s;everance mu&s;t finally &s;ucceed. This is the decree of Providence in all ca&s;es,
<Q>he that per&s;evereth unto the end &s;hall be &s;aved.</Q>
We have, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, effectually baffled all their former attempts; but if we fail in this, all our former victo|ries will only &s;erve to make our fall the more con&s;picuous and terrible.</P>
<P>I will not enquire what would have been the efficacy of any heretofore recommend|ed, but untried means. The wor&s;t that can has happened, and it is with it we have now to deal; to relinqui&s;h it on our part,
<PB N="101" REF="014966_0109_0F954E86B8DD82A8">
would be to give up the matter, for how|ever any means might once have done, cow|ardice alone would now de&s;ert the field, and &s;lavery mu&s;t be the inevitable con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I do not wonder that war &s;its heavy on us&punc; and that we are &s;omewhat re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y; but I &s;hall be &s;urprized, if we, who have &s;o long and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed ty|ranny and oppre&s;&s;ion &s;hould all on a &s;udden lo&s;e every de&s;ire of retaining our liberties. I am forced into this remark by the artful, cunning and de&s;igning manner in which &s;ome men talk of a reconciliation with Great Britain, and the bug-bears they conjure up to frighten the timid, irre&s;olute and igno|rant, from a &s;teady pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e means, which alone can help us in our pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances. Facts bear evidence from the beginning of the conte&s;t that eve|ry &s;cheme they ever recommended has, up|on trial, proved inadequate to the end for which it was intended; yet they proceed. Beware of &s;uch men, they love neither their country, nor their liberties, &s;o much as &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>There are many I doubt not who are de|nominated Tories by the more zealous
<PB N="102" REF="014966_0110_0F954E8F170CF488">
Whigs, who in their hearts wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to our mea&s;ures, tho' they may be chagrined becau&s;e tho&s;e they propo&s;ed did not go down with the people; the&s;e are uniform, open, and not very dangerous; but there are others, who under the cloke of friend&s;hip for the cau&s;e, harbour the bittere&s;t rancour and malice in their hearts. The&s;e talk fa|vourably in general, though their di&s;cour&s;es mo&s;tly terminate with a <HI>doubt, &s;u&s;picion,</HI> or <HI>but,</HI> which gives tho&s;e with whom they conver&s;e, rea&s;on to dread &s;ome hidden de|&s;ign, or approaching evil, which mo&s;t men have not properly attended to. They art|fully recal your attention to a certain peri|od, when all was peace and quietne&s;s, and by pathetically lamenting the unhappy al|teration, endeavour to impre&s;s your minds with an opinion that all our troubles aro&s;e from our&s;elves. They carefully avoid men|tioning the iniquitous mea&s;ures of the Bri|ti&s;h government which produced them, and by keeping tho&s;e out of &s;ight, they gradual|ly lead the unwary into the belief, that the men who have been mo&s;t active on the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion in oppo&s;ing the tyrannical pro|ceedings of Great-Britain, and who have hazarded their all in defence of their coun|try, have been actuated by &s;ini&s;ter motives
<PB N="103" REF="014966_0111_0F954E8FE07EB1F0">
in all they have done. If every man who hears &s;uch in&s;inuations were to a&s;k tho&s;e who ca&s;t them out, what mea&s;ures have not the men they condemn tried at one time or another to avoid the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, and &s;ave our liberties? What advantages they can reap by a &s;ucce&s;sful end of it, which every other freeman on the continent will not reap equally with them? And in an un&s;ucce&s;sful clo&s;e of it, all will allow they mu&s;t be the greate&s;t &s;ufferers. Their lives mu&s;t go, let who will el&s;e e&s;cape. The&s;e que&s;tions might recal them to facts, and the&s;e facts would enable men to judge aright.</P>
<P>Hone&s;ty could not &s;tand the force of a few pertinent que&s;tions, but the&s;e men have taken their leave of it, and like Mana&s;&s;eh of old, have &s;old them&s;elves to do wicked|ly. Were it not &s;o, could it be po&s;&s;ible for them in the face of the &s;un, to charge all our troubles on the New-England Pre&s;by|terians, troubles which originally began and have all along been kept up by a wicked ad|mini&s;tration and a venal parliament.

oppo&s;ition, which a Penn&s;ylvanian Quaker, a Maryland and a Virginian Churchman did more to effect than all the other men on the continent put together, is cruelty in the ex|treme. My heart bleeds when I think of &s;uch men; who would &s;ell the whole con|tinent and all the blood on it for private ad|vantage, and with whom a few thou&s;and guineas with a title would be e&s;teemed an equivalent for the lives, liberty and proper|ty of the freemen of a colony. May that God who &s;ees how little they can gain, if &s;ucce&s;sful, open their eyes and turn their hearts, e'er they be convinced by fatal ex|perience, that he who purcha&s;es the whole world at the price of his &s;oul, is a very un|wi&s;e dealer, and makes but a poor bargain in the end. If the calls of virtue, the pre|cepts of religion, and dictates of patrioti&s;m cannot awaken them to a &s;en&s;e of their du|ty, yet Norfolk might open their eyes. But let them do as they plea&s;e, we ought to act wi&s;ely. If we do not make &s;uch a &s;ettle|ment now as will &s;ecure the privileges we contend for to po&s;terity, we entail either &s;la|very or a civil war on our children. This is certain, let what will be doubtful. Look round you then, view your offspring, and tell me, are you willing to leave them &s;uch

a legacy? Do not trifle on this occa&s;ion, all your other legacies mu&s;t derive their true value from the part you now take in this conte&s;t. Think not that the God who charges him with wor&s;e than infidelity who provides not for his own, and tho&s;e of his hou&s;hold, will ju&s;tify you in returning to the &s;tate you were in when our troubles began, and there|by delivering over your offspring to the mi&s;|chievous machinations of a power that from the beginning has &s;et right, ju&s;tice, and mer|cy at defiance, and in all her deliberations con&s;idered nothing but her ability to exe|cute.</P>

<Q>If that is all they want, we are agreed;</Q>
and the &s;ay|ing plea&s;es many of you. His Lord&s;hip, like others, who have learned wi&s;dom by ex|perience, wi&s;hes to have all to begin again, believing that he could more ea&s;ily effect his purpo&s;e by other means than tho&s;e he is at pre&s;ent pur&s;uing.

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on <HI>LORD NORTH's</HI> Conciliatory PLAN.</HEAD>
<P>I CANNOT recal an idea to my mind more amazingly ab&s;urd and &s;tupid than the idea of Lord North's &s;econd attempt to gull the Coloni&s;ts into a belief of his in|clination to hold out to them terms of a &s;afe and amicable reconciliation, with Great Britain. No one is ignorant that the Ame|ricans have offered every thing that can po&s;&s;ibly be devi&s;ed to bury the injurious and en&s;laving claim of admini&s;tration, in perpetual oblivion, and leave matters on the &s;ame footing they were before the pretence was held up. Tho&s;e generous propo&s;als, however often repeated, have as often been rejected with an in&s;olent contempt, and yet the profound politician tells his op|ponents in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, that he is heartily inclined to a reconcilia|tion with the Colonies, and willing to put them in the &s;ituation they &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ire; that is, &s;ays he, to a courtier de|manding explanation, <HI>in a &s;tate of ab&s;o|lute dependance on the Briti&s;h parliament in all ca&s;es what&s;oever</HI>; for, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, they were unque&s;tionably thus dependant

in 1763, had his Lord&s;hip entirely forgot the &s;ucce&s;s of his former experiment, per|haps a trial of the &s;ame wretched <HI>trick</HI> over again, might have appeared le&s;s ri|diculous, I may indeed &s;ay, le&s;s in&s;ulting to the lowe&s;t under&s;tanding. I would a&s;k the mo&s;t credulous votary for making up the di&s;pute, what po&s;&s;ible grounds they per|ceive to found their expectation of a perma|nent reconciliation upon? Has any thing lately turned up, which has indicated a change of di&s;po&s;ition in the Prince or his favorites? Can a majority, which have been &s;ecured from one &s;even years to another, by pure force of corruption, be depended on to remain firm to a &s;laughtering, plun|dering and de&s;olating court, and &s;hare the dete&s;tation of pre&s;ent and future ages, for mere nothing? Has the court re&s;olved to ca&s;t Bernard, Hutchin&s;on and daughter, Richard&s;on the murderer, crazy John Mal|colm, and Richard&s;on the recent volun|teer, out on the common? I tell you, nay! You have a fre&s;h in&s;tance of the firmne&s;s of the cabinet, in adding another three thou&s;and pound pen&s;ioner to the li&s;t, in a conjuncture, when all mankind will confe&s;s there is need of &s;aving.

of the dominions! If Great Britain and Ire|land have conceived &s;uch a mortal hatred to America, that they can hug her mo&s;t inveterate enemies in their bo&s;oms, and vote them &s;uch munificent rewards for drawing her into &s;o de&s;tructive a civil war, we can|not be &s;afe in the power of &s;uch enemies. If they abound in re&s;ources as largely as Mr. Wedderburne and others boa&s;t they do, let them cea&s;e complaining of their poverty, and contentedly di&s;charge their own national debt, rather than go on aug|menting it by their efforts to &s;addle it, with an unlimited pen&s;ion li&s;t on America. Does the nation bear the weight of the pre&s;ent unnatural quarrel with America on other terms, than a firm a&s;&s;urance of the Court, that millions of leading men's dependants &s;hall be provided for in America, for whom places can by no means be found at home. Is not the very genius of the people of Great Britain and Ireland corrupted, in&s;o|much, that the views of young fellows of education, or any connection with men of note, are altogether &s;et on public money? Can our peaceable men indulge a gleam of hope, that this humour will alter, or that youths, bred in idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, will become indu&s;trious and di&s;intere&s;ted pa|triots

If not, they mu&s;t then be &s;o weak as to conceit, that mini&s;ters will become le&s;s fond of fingering the public money, and &s;ecuring them&s;elves in places of power and profit by means of it; indeed, that they will become more hone&s;t and &s;aving of the national money than tho&s;e the con&s;titution has appointed as a check upon them. It is no wonder they tell of &s;ending a formida|ble fleet and army to bring over their terms of reconciliation, when they are in no one article different from the terms they fir&s;t aimed to impo&s;e. Had the mini&s;ter, or more properly the ob&s;tinate author of all our troubles, had the remote&s;t idea of fa|vouring us with a government of laws, which had any re&s;pect to the &s;ecurity of our lives and properties, he had long &s;ince granted with a good grace, petitions, made and repeated with the mo&s;t dutiful per&s;ever|ing affection, which a&s;ked for nothing more! <HI>Sed aut Cae&s;ar aut nullus,</HI> &s;eems the unalter|able determination of the man, who &s;oothed our already elated expectations, by an in|augural declaration, that he <HI>gloried</HI> in the name of Briton, at that time, a di&s;tinctive characteri&s;tic of the patrons of univer&s;al li|berty.

It is evident they have concluded on two things, viz. to make a bold pu&s;h for our entire &s;ubjection, as their ends would be thereby more readily an&s;wered; but that being found impracti|cable, we are to be tried with negociation, in which all the craft, duplicity and punic faith of admini&s;tration is to be expected. Pray God it may be wi&s;ely and firmly guarded again&s;t! The worthy and honor|able John Collins, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Newport, Rhode I&s;land, on the arrival of Lord North's la&s;t conciliatory plan, ob&s;erved, that notwith|&s;tanding the expo&s;ure of his large e&s;tate, to whatever depredations the enemy &s;aw fit to make upon it, he was more concerned for the probable &s;ucce&s;s of their arts than arms. Had the Americans in general the wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s of that gentleman, matters would never have come to the pre|&s;ent

melancholy lengths we find them. However, in the great and general plan of him who putteth down and &s;etteth up &s;tates, this is doubtle&s;s an indi&s;pen&s;able part, and therefore not to be complained of; but it has amazed me to contemplate the nume|rous in&s;tances of di&s;appointment our ene|mies have met with, in every plot they have laid for our de&s;truction. How did Bernard and Hutchin&s;on flatter them&s;elves with the number of friends they had in &s;everal towns of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and thought that a very trifling force, from the other &s;ide of the water, added to their minions, depend|ants and expectants, would cru&s;h a little tur|bulent faction, who di&s;turbed their darling mea&s;ures? Certainly men intoxicated with a lu&s;t of ab&s;olute power found &s;omething in the appearance of things to tole them on to an object &s;o grateful to their fonde&s;t wi&s;hes; other wi&s;e they would have been contented to augment and confirm their power by &s;uch unperceived degrees that the <HI>happy days,</HI> many tell us we have enjoyed under a continually invading u&s;urpation, would not yet have been &s;o &s;en&s;ibly interrupted. No le&s;s has the &s;o often extolled Governor Tryon been di&s;appointed in his benevolent intentions re&s;pecting New-York. His band

on Long I&s;land, and on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's river, with Sir John John&s;on a|mong his va&s;&s;als, and the Indians, gave him great hopes of having matters in a fine train before the invincible armada arrived in the &s;pring; in&s;tead of which, it is pro|bable the active General Lee will &s;o fortify that place, that all the force they can &s;end again&s;t it, will be in&s;ufficient to reduce it. Dunmore, with all his wanton ravage, has done little more than exa&s;perate the Vir|ginians, and convinced that brave Colony, that they can be formidable to &s;avages on the ea&s;t, as well as we&s;t &s;ide of their dominion. Carleton's Canadians, make no &s;uch figure in the harangues of the pen|&s;ioner, as they did la&s;t year; and in ca&s;e foreigners are to be procured to be poured in upon us, the greate&s;t oppo&s;ers of our total &s;eparation from Britain acknowledge, they would then no longer defer a declara|tion of independancy, and application to other powers for their protection. To this the whole &s;cene appears rapidly ad|vancing, in my view, as ha&s;tily as in|finite wi&s;dom thinks proper to conduct it; and if this be his mo&s;t gracious de&s;ign, he will work, and none &s;hall hinder.

<HEAD>APPENDIX TO COMMON SENSE. The nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>INDEPENDANCY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SINCE the publication of the fir&s;t edition of this pamphlet, or rather on the &s;ame day on which it came out, the King's Speech made its appearance in this city. Had the &s;pirit of prophecy di|rected the birth of this production, it could not have brought it forth, at a more &s;ea|&s;onable juncture, or a more nece&s;&s;ary time. The bloody mindedne&s;s of the one, &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing the doctrine of the other. Men read by way of revenge. And the Speech, in&s;tead of terrifying, pre|pared a way for the manly principles of Independance.</P>
<P>Ceremony, and even &s;ilence, from what|ever motive they may ari&s;e, have a hurt|ful tendency, when they give the lea&s;t degree of countenance to ba&s;e and wicked performances; wherefore, if this maxim
<PB N="122" REF="014966_0130_0F954EAF429BC538">
be admitted, it naturally follows, that the King's Speech, as being a piece of fini&s;hed villainy, de&s;erved, and &s;till de&s;erves, a ge|neral execration, both by the Congre&s;s and the people. Yet, as the dome&s;tic tran|quillity of a nation, depends greatly on the <HI>cha&s;tity</HI> of what may properly be cal|led NATIONAL MANNERS, it is often bet|ter, to pa&s;s &s;ome things over in &s;ilent di&s;|dain, than to make u&s;e of &s;uch new me|thods of di&s;like, as might introduce the lea&s;t innovation, on that guardian of our peace and &s;afety. And, perhaps, it is chiefly owing to this prudent delicacy, that the King's Speech hath not, before now, &s;uffered a public execution. The Speech, if it may be called one, is nothing better than a wilful audacious libel again&s;t the truth, the common good, and the ex|i&s;tence of mankind; and is a formal and pompous method of offering up human &s;a|crifices, to the pride of tyrants. But this general ma&s;&s;acre of mankind, is one of the privileges, and the certain con&s;e|quence of King's; for as nature knows them <HI>not,</HI> they know <HI>not her,</HI> and although they are beings of our <HI>own</HI> creating, they know not <HI>us,</HI> and are become the Gods of their creators.

<P>Sir John Dalrymple, the putative father of a whining je&s;uitical piece, fallaciou&s;ly called, "<HI>The addre&s;s of the people of</HI> Eng|land, <HI>to the Inhabitants of</HI> America," hath, perhaps, from a vain &s;uppo&s;ition, that the people <HI>here</HI> were to be frightened at the pomp and de&s;cription of a king, giving, (though very unwi&s;ely on his part) the real character of the pre&s;ent one: "But," &s;ays this writer, "if you are inclined to pay compliments to an admini&s;tration which we do not complain of, (meaning the Marquis of Rockingham's at the repeal of the Stamp Act,) it is very unfair in you to withhold them from that prince <HI>by who&s;e</HI> NOD ALONE, <HI>they were permitted to do any thing.</HI>" This is toryi&s;m with a witne&s;s!

<P>However, it matters very little now, what the king of England either &s;ays or does; he hath wickedly broken through every moral and human obligation, tramp|led nature and con&s;cience beneath his feet; and by a &s;teady and con&s;titutional &s;pirit of in&s;olence and cruelty, procured for him|&s;elf an univer&s;al hatred.

<P>Fir&s;t, That it is the intere&s;t of America, to be &s;eparated from Britain.</P>
<P>Secondly, Which is the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t practicable plan, RECONCILIATION or IN|DEPENDANCE? with &s;ome occa&s;ional re|marks.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the fir&s;t, I could, If I judged it proper, produce the opinion of &s;ome of the able&s;t and mo&s;t experienced men on this continent; and who&s;e &s;enti|ments, on that head, are not yet publicly known. It is in reality a &s;elf evident po&s;ition: For no nation, in a &s;tate of fo|reign dependance, limited in its commerce, and cramped and fettered in its legi|&s;lative powers, can ever arrive at any material eminence. America doth not yet know what opulence is; and al|though the progre&s;s which &s;he hath made, &s;tands unparalleled in the hi&s;tory of other nations, it is but childhood, com|pared with what &s;he would be capable of arriving at, had &s;he, as &s;he ought to have, the legi&s;lative powers in her own hands.

England, is at this time, proudly coveting what would do her no good, were &s;he to accompli&s;h it; and the continent he&s;itating on a matter, which will be her final ruin if neglected. It is the commerce, and not the conque&s;t of America, by which Eng|land is to be benefited, and that would in a great mea&s;ure continue, were the countries as independant of each other as France and Spain; becau&s;e in many articles, neither can go to a better market. But it is the independance of this country on Britain or any other, which is now the main and only object worthy of contention, and which, like all other truths di&s;covered by nece&s;&s;ity, will appear clear and &s;tronger every day.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Becau&s;e it will come to that one time or other.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e the longer it is de|layed, the harder it will be to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>I have frequently amu&s;ed my&s;elf both in public and private companies, with &s;i|lently remarking the &s;pecious errors of tho&s;e who &s;peak without reflecting. And among the many which I have heard, the follow|ing

&s;eems the mo&s;t general, viz. that had this rupture happened forty or fifty years hence, in&s;tead of now, the continent would have been more able to have &s;haken off the dependance. To which I reply, that our military ability <HI>at this time,</HI> ari&s;es from the experience gained in the la&s;t war, and which in forty or fifty years time, would have been totally extinct. The Continent would not, by that time, have had a Ge|neral, or even a military officer left; and we, or tho&s;e who may &s;ucceed us, would have been as ignorant of martial matters as the ancient Indians: And this &s;ingle po|&s;ition, clo&s;ely attended to, will unan&s;wer|ably prove, that the pre&s;ent time is prefer|able to all others: The argument turns thus: At the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t war, we had experience, but wanted numbers; and forty or fifty years hence, we &s;hould have num|bers, without experience; wherefore, the proper point of time, mu&s;t be &s;ome parti|cular point between the two extremes, in which a &s;ufficiency of the former remains, and a proper encrea&s;e of the latter is obtain|ed: And that point of time is the pre&s;ent time.</P>

<P>Should affairs be patched up with Bri|tain, and &s;he to remain the governing and &s;overeign power of America, (which as matters are now circum&s;tanced, is giving up the point entirely) we &s;hall deprive our&s;elves of the very means of &s;inking the debt we have, or may contract. The value of the back lands, which &s;ome of the provinces are clande&s;tinely deprived of, by the unju&s;t exten&s;ion of the limits of Cana|da, valued only at five pounds &s;terling per hundred acres, amount to upwards of twen|ty five millions, Penn&s;ylvania currency; and the quit-rents at one penny &s;terling per acre, to two millions yearly.</P>
<P>It is by the &s;ale of tho&s;e lands, that the debt may be &s;unk, without burthen to any, and the quit-rent re&s;erved thereon, will always le&s;&s;en, and in time will wholly &s;up|port the yearly expence of government. It matters not how long the debt is in paying, &s;o that the lands when &s;old, be applied to the di&s;charge of it, and for the execution of which, the Congre&s;s for the time being, will be the continental tru&s;tees.</P>

<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of America is truly a|larming to every man who is capable of reflection. Without law, without govern|ment, without any other mode of power than what is founded on, and granted by courte&s;y. Held together by an unexampled concurrence of &s;entiment, which, is never|thele&s;s &s;ubject to change, and which, every &s;ecret enemy is endeavouring to di&s;&s;olve. Our pre&s;ent condition, is, Legi&s;lation with|out law, wi&s;dom without a plan, a con&s;ti|tution without a name, and, what is &s;trangely a&s;toni&s;hing, perfect independance contending for dependance. The in&s;tance
<PB N="130" REF="014966_0138_0F954EB5F8565148">
is without a precedent; the ca&s;e never ex|i&s;ted before; and who can tell what may be the event? The property of no man is &s;ecure in the pre&s;ent unbraced &s;y&s;tem of things. The mind of the multitude is left at random, and &s;eeing no fixed object be|fore them, they pur&s;ue &s;uch as fancy or opinion &s;tarts. Nothing is criminal; there is no &s;uch thing as trea&s;on; wherefore, every one thinks him&s;elf at liberty to act as he plea&s;es. The Tories would not have da|red to a&s;&s;emble offen&s;ively, had they known that their lives, by that act, were forfeited to the laws of the &s;tate. A line of di&s;tinc|tion &s;hould be drawn, between Engli&s;h &s;ol|diers taken in battle, and inhabitants of America taken in arms. The fir&s;t are pri|&s;oners, but the latter traitors. The one forfeits his liberty, the other his head.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding our wi&s;dom, there is a vi&s;ible feeblene&s;s in &s;ome of our proceed|ings, which gives encouragement to di&s;&s;en|tions.

The artful and hypocritical letter, which ap|peared a few months ago, in two of the New-York papers, and likewi&s;e in two others, is an evidence, that there are men who want either judgment or hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y getting into holes and corners, and talking of reconciliation: But do &s;uch men &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, how difficult the ta&s;k is, and how dangerous it may prove, &s;hould the Continent divide thereon. Do they take within their view, all the va|rious orders of men, who&s;e &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, as well as their own, are to be con&s;idered therein. Do they put them|&s;elves in the place of the &s;ufferer, who&s;e <HI>all</HI> is <HI>already</HI> gone, and of the &s;oldier, who hath quitted <HI>all</HI> for the defence of his country.

It is the violence which is done and threatened to our per&s;ons; the de&s;truction of our property by an armed force; the in|va&s;ion of our country by fire and &s;word, which con&s;cientiou&s;ly qualifies the u&s;e of arms: And the in&s;tant, in which &s;uch a mode of defence became nece&s;&s;ary, all &s;ub|jection to Britain ought to have cea&s;ed; and the independancy of America, &s;hould have been con&s;idered, as dating its aera from, and publi&s;hed by, <HI>the fir&s;t mu&s;ket that was fired again&s;t her.</HI> This line is a line of con|&s;i&s;tency; neither drawn by caprice, nor ex|tended by ambition; but produced by a chain of events, of which the colonies were not the authors.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the&s;e remarks, with the following timely and well intended hints. We ought to reflect, that there are three different ways by which an independancy
<PB N="134" REF="014966_0142_0F954EB8F9307CD8">
may hereafter be affected; and that <HI>one</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>three,</HI> will one day or other, be the fate of America, viz. By the legal voice of the people in Congre&s;s; by a military power; or by a mob: It may not always happen that our &s;oldiers are citizens, and the multitude a body of rea&s;onable men; virtue, as I have already remarked, is not heredi|tary, neither is it perpetual. Should an in|dependancy be brought about by the fir&s;t of tho&s;e means, we have every opportunity and every encouragement before us, to form the noble&s;t pure&s;t con&s;titution on the face of the earth. We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A &s;ituation, &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent, hath not happened &s;ince the days of Noah until now. The birth day of a new world is at hand, and a race of men, perhaps as numerous as all Europe contains, are to receive their portion of freedom from the event of a few months. The reflection is awful, and in this point of view, how trifling, how ridiculous, do the little, paltry cavillings, of a few weak or intere&s;ted men appear, when weighed again&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s of a world.</P>
<P>Should we neglect the pre&s;ent favorable and inviting period, and an independance
<PB N="135" REF="014966_0143_0F954EBAC33B9360">
be hereafter effected by any other means, we mu&s;t charge the con&s;equence to our|&s;elves, or to tho&s;e rather, who&s;e narrow and prejudiced &s;ouls, are habitually oppo&s;ing the mea&s;ure, without either inquiring or reflecting. There are rea&s;ons to be given in &s;upport of independance, which men &s;hould rather privately think of, than be publicly told of. We ought not now to be debating whether we &s;hall be indepen|dant or not, but, anxious to accompli&s;h it on a firm, &s;ecure, and honorable ba&s;is, and unea&s;y rather that it is not yet began upon. Every day convinces us of its nece&s;&s;ity: Even the Tories (if &s;uch beings yet remain among us) &s;hould, of all men, be the mo&s;t &s;olicitous to promote it; for as the appoint|ment of committees at fir&s;t, protected them from popular rage, &s;o, a wi&s;e and well e&s;tabli&s;hed form of government, will be the only certain means of continuing it &s;ecurely to them. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> if they have not virtue enough to be WHIGS, they ought to have prudence enough to wi&s;h for Independance.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Independance is the only BOND that can tye and keep us together. We &s;hall then &s;ee our object, and our ears will be legally &s;hut again&s;t the &s;chemes of an in|triguing,

as well, as a cruel enemy. We &s;hall then too, be on a proper footing, to treat with Britain; for there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the pride of that court, will be le&s;s hurt by treating with the American &s;tates for terms of peace, than with tho&s;e, whom &s;he denominates, "rebellious &s;ub|jects," for terms of accommodation. It is our delaying in that, encourages her to hope for conque&s;t, and our backwardne&s;s tends only to prolong the war. As we have, without any good effect therefrom, with|held our trade to obtain a redre&s;s of our grievances, let us now try the alternative, by independantly redre&s;&s;ing them our&s;elves, and then offering to open the trade. The mercantile and rea&s;onable part in England, will be &s;till with us; becau&s;e, peace with trade, is preferable to war without it.

&s;pend your partial invectives again&s;t the in|jured and the in&s;ulted only, but, like faith|ful mini&s;ters, would cry aloud and <HI>&s;pare none.</HI> Say not that ye are per&s;ecuted, neither en|deavor to make us the authors of that re|proach, which, ye are bringing upon your|&s;elves; for we te&s;tify unto all men, that we do not complain again&s;t you, becau&s;e ye are <HI>Quakers,</HI> but becau&s;e ye pretend to <HI>be</HI> and are not Quakers.</P>
<P>Alas! it &s;eems by the particular tendency of &s;ome part of your te&s;timony, and other parts of your conduct, as if, all &s;in was re|duced to, and comprehended in, <HI>the act of bearing arms,</HI> and that by the people only. Ye appear to us, to have mi&s;taken party for con&s;cience; becau&s;e, the general tenor of your actions wants uniformity: And it is exceedingly difficult to us to give credit to many of your pretended &s;cruples; becau&s;e, we &s;ee them made by the &s;ame men, who, in the very in&s;tant that they are exclaiming again&s;t the mammon of this world, are ne|verthele&s;s, hunting after it with a &s;tep as &s;teady as Time, and an appetite as keen as Death.</P>
<P>The quotation which ye have made from Proverbs, in the third page of your te&s;ti|mony, that, "when a man's ways plea&s;e
<PB N="143" REF="014966_0151_0F954E7475058450">
the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him;" is very unwi&s;ely cho&s;en on your part; becau&s;e, it amounts to a proof, that the king's ways (whom ye are &s;o de&s;irous of &s;upporting) do not plea&s;e the Lord, otherwi&s;e, his reign would be in peace.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the latter part of your te&s;timony, and that, for which all the fore|going &s;eems only an introduction, viz.</P>
<P>"It hath ever been our judgment and principle, &s;ince we were called to profe&s;s the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, manife&s;ted in our con&s;ciences unto this day, that the &s;etting up and putting down kings and governments, is God's peculiar prerogative; for cau&s;es be&s;t known to him&s;elf: And that it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to have any hand or contriv|ance therein; nor to be bu&s;y bodies above our &s;tation, much le&s;s to plot and contrive the ruin, or overturn of any of them, but to pray for the king, and &s;afety of our nation, and good of all men: That we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty: <HI>under the government which God is plea&s;ed to &s;et over us</HI>"&mdash;If the&s;e are really your principles, why do you not abide by them? Why do you not leave that, which ye call God's work, to be managed by
<PB N="144" REF="014966_0152_0F954EBFC8647000">
him&s;elf? The&s;e very principles in&s;truct you to wait with patience and humility, for the event of all public mea&s;ures, and to recieve that event as the divine will towards you. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> what occa&s;ion is there for your <HI>political te&s;timony</HI> if you fully believe what it contains? And the very publi&s;hing it proves, that either, ye do not believe what ye profe&s;s, or have not virtue enough to practi&s;e what ye believe.</P>
<P>The principles of Quakeri&s;m have a di|rect tendency to make a man the quiet and inoffen&s;ive &s;ubject of any, and every go|vernment which is &s;et over him. And if the &s;etting up and putting down of kings and governments is God's peculiar preroga|tive, he mo&s;t certainly will not be robbed thereof by us; wherefore the principle it|&s;elf leads you to approve of every thing, which ever happened, or may happen to kings as being his work. Oliver Cromwell thanks you, Charles, then, died not by the hands of man; and &s;hould the pre&s;ent proud Imitator of him, come to the &s;ame untimely end, the writers and publi&s;hers of the te&s;timony, are bound by the doctrine it contains, to applaud the fact. Kings are not taken away by miracles, neither are changes in government brought about by
<PB N="145" REF="014966_0153_0F954E74CF8071E0">
any other means than &s;uch as are common and human; and &s;uch as we are now u&s;ing. Even the di&s;per&s;ion of the Jews, though foretold by our Saviour, was effected by arms. Wherefore, as ye refu&s;e to be the means on one &s;ide, ye ought not to be med|lers on the other; but to wait the i&s;&s;ue in &s;ilence? and unle&s;s ye can produce divine authority, to prove, that the Almighty who hath created and placed this new world at the greate&s;t di&s;tance it could po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand, ea&s;t and we&s;t, from every part of the old, doth, neverthele&s;s, di&s;approve of its being independant of the corrupt and abandoned court of Britain, unle&s;s I &s;ay, ye can &s;hew this, how can ye on the ground of your principles, ju&s;tify the exciting and &s;tirring up the people
<Q>firmly to unite in the <HI>abhorrence</HI> of all &s;uch <HI>writings,</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ures,</HI> as evidence a de&s;ire and de&s;ign to break off the <HI>happy</HI> connexion we have hitherto enjoyed, with the kingdom of Great Britain, and our ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubordination to the king, and tho&s;e who are lawfully placed in authority under him.</Q>
What a &s;lap of the face is here! The men, who in the very paragraph be|fore, have quietly and pa&s;&s;ively re&s;igned up the ordering, altering, and di&s;po&s;al of kings
<PB N="146" REF="014966_0154_0F954EC0809041B0">
and governments, into the hands of God, are now recalling their principles, and put|ting in for a &s;hare of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the conclu&s;ion, which is here ju&s;tly quoted, can any ways follow from the doctrine laid down? The incon&s;i&s;tency is too glaring not to be &s;een; the ab&s;urdity too great not to be laughed at; and &s;uch as could only have been made by tho&s;e, who&s;e under&s;tandings were darkened by the nar|row and crabbed &s;pirit of a de&s;pairing poli|tical party; for ye are not to be con&s;idered as the whole body of the Quakers, but on|ly as a factional and fractional part thereof.</P>
<P>Here ends the examination of your te&s;ti|mony; (which I call upon no man to abhor, as ye have done, but only to read and judge of fairly;) to which I &s;ubjoin the following remark; "That the &s;etting up and putting down of kings," mo&s;t certainly mean, the making him a king, who is yet not &s;o, and the making him no king who is already one. And pray what hath this to do in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? We neither mean to <HI>&s;et up</HI> nor to <HI>pull down,</HI> neither to <HI>make</HI> nor to <HI>un|make,</HI> but to have nothing to <HI>do</HI> with them. Wherefore, your te&s;timony in whatever light it is viewed &s;erves only to di&s;honor your
<PB N="147" REF="014966_0155_0F954EC24DDFC200">
judgment, and for many other rea&s;ons had better have been let alone than publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e it tends to the decrea&s;e and reproach of all religion whatever, and is of the utmo&s;t danger to &s;ociety, to make it a party in political di&s;putes.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e it exhibits a body of men, numbers of whom di&s;avow the pub|li&s;hing political te&s;tomonies, as being con|cerned therein and approvers thereof.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e it hath a tendency to undo that continental harmony and friend|&s;hip which your&s;elves by your late liberal and charitable donations hath lent a hand to e&s;tabli&s;h; and the pre&s;ervation of which, is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to us all.</P>
<P>And here without anger or re&s;entment I bid you farewell. Sincerely wi&s;hing, that as men and chri&s;tians, ye may always fully and uninterruptedly enjoy every civil and re|ligious right; and be in your turn, the means of &s;ecuring it to others; but that the example which ye have unwi&s;ely &s;et, of mingling religion with politics, <HI>may be di&s;|avowed and reprobated by every inhabitant of</HI> AMERICA.</P>

<HEAD>ROBERT BELL, Book&s;eller, to the Public.</HEAD>
<Q>Self-defence again&s;t unju&s;t attacks needs no apology. <BIBL>Bell.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE pamphlet of large ADDITIONS to Common Sen&s;e, containing &s;everal excellent pieces, written by &s;ome worthy and re&s;pectable citizens of Philadelphia, are in the opinion of &s;ome gentlemen, who are good judges of literary merit, thought worthy of pre&s;ervation, in &s;uch manner as to bind with other pamphlets in an octavo volume.&mdash;Tho&s;e that think as they do, will buy, and tho&s;e who do not think in that manner, will let them alone.</P>
<P>The judicious and di&s;cerning have perception &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve this, without the unnece&s;&s;ary intervention of the Fo&s;ter-Father-Author's optics (who&s;e &s;elf-imagined importance hath &s;welled him into contemptible con&s;equen|tiality) becau&s;e the Provedore to the Sentimentali&s;ts doth not PRINT decent EDITIONS for &s;uch ignoramus's as Lord Dunmore's NEGROES.</P>
<P>The envious Mr. ANONYMOUS, the &s;hadow of an au|thor, with his murdering MASK and his DARK LAN|THORN, fully equipped for the ruffian bu&s;ine&s;s of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation (like unto a villainous THIEF, who&s;e voracious cravings for PREY con&s;train him to forget the fears which forced him &s;o lately to &s;camper away) hath once more crept into the field to ROB and to DESTROY the reputation of authors, who&s;e literary abilities OUT-SHINE his, as far as the blaze of a torch OUT-SHINETH the glimmering of a candle.&mdash;</P>
<P>Be&s;ide their &s;uperior talents in literature, they have thereto added (in his eyes) another mo&s;t grievous offence by their not employing him as a go-between, that he might thereby have an opportunity to in&s;inuate there is no WRITERS in America but the wou'd-be author of Common Sen&s;e&mdash;This &s;tolen applau&s;e he is avariciou&s;ly attached unto, although he certainly knoweth the tickli&s;h tenure of &s;uch u&s;urped reputation&mdash;For if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only a &s;mall &s;hare of internal hone&s;ty, he would be con&s;trained to cry out in the emphatic words of the poor I&s;raelite, who lo&s;t the hatchet&mdash;ALAS! FOR IT WAS BORROWED.</P>
<P>P. S. The judicious part of the public know that the o&s;ten&s;ible author was, and &s;till is the aggre&s;&s;or, yet the real book&s;eller, who hateth di&s;&s;imulation, giveth the following true KEY to the whole di&s;pute.&mdash;</P>
<P>When the work was at a &s;tand for want of a courageous Typographer, I was then recommended by a gentleman nearly in the following words, "There is Bell, he is a Republican Printer, give it to him, and I will an&s;wer for his courage to PRINT IT.</P>
<P><PB REF="014966_0158_0F954EC437DF63F8">This &s;ame Mr. ANONYMOUS, this Amanuen&s;is to a group of authors, on &s;eeing the manly fortitude with which R. Bell printed his name on the title of the flam|ing production, to &s;ound the depths of the multitude for a virtuous and glorious independancy; and afterwards be|holding the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;ale and of the &s;entiment, he immediately formed the ungrateful de&s;ign of jockeying the Printer, who had to plea&s;e the authors, and &s;erve the cau&s;e, done fifty pounds worth of work for the &s;mall price of twenty pounds, and at the &s;ame time formed the di&s;|graceful intention to circumvent the real book&s;eller, by who&s;e knowledge in bu&s;ine&s;s the pamphlet was made re&s;|pectable&mdash;Upon the Book&s;eller's di&s;covering the&s;e &s;hame|ful veerings, he laid immediate hold on the indubitable MAXIM in the law of retaliation, which he holdeth to be as invulnerable, in the practice of the world, as the law of &s;elf-defence, and therefore determined to out-jockey if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Book&s;eller's &s;ucce&s;s in this manoeuvre was &s;o ex|ceeding galling to the ingrate GO-BETWEEN, who fir&s;t made the vicious attempt, that to be convicted and foiled at his own weapons was more than his capricious di&s;po&s;i|tion was able to &s;u&s;tain. He immediately fell into a fit of ill-natured, o&s;tentatious, and pretended genero&s;ity, which would mo&s;t certainly have carried him to Bedlam or a p&mdash;n, had he not in the mid&s;t of his deba&s;ement recol|lected it was not yet quite impo&s;&s;ible for him to ari&s;e again, by touching public money, and to attain to be the MASSANELLO among authors and book&s;ellers, at lea&s;t for one DAY.</P>
<P>N. B. Robert Bell, in Third-&s;treet, continueth to &s;ell to all who are capable of making proper di&s;tinctions, the large edition of Common Sen&s;e with ALL the aditions and improvements; al&s;o the appendix, and addre&s;s to the Quakers COMPLETE.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>General Montgomery.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to &s;ee you. I &s;till love liberty and America, and the contemplation of the future greatne&s;s of this Continent now forms a large &s;hare of my pre&s;ent happine&s;s. I am &s;ent here up|on an important errand, to warn you a|gain&s;t li&s;tening to terms of accomodations from the court of Britain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall be happy in receiving in|&s;truction from you in the pre&s;ent trying ex|igency of our public affairs. But &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="014966_0161_0F954EC67ACFF438">
the terms you &s;peak of &s;hould be ju&s;t and honorable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you expect the&s;e, after the King has proclaimed you rebels from the throne, and after both hou&s;es of parliament have re&s;olved to &s;upport him in carrying on a war again&s;t you? No, I &s;ee no offers from Great Britain but of PARDON. The very word is an in&s;ult upon our cau&s;e. To whom is pardon offered?&mdash;to virtuous freemen. For what?&mdash;for flying to arms in defence of the rights of humanity: And from whom do the&s;e offers come? From a ROYAL CRIMINAL. You have furni&s;hed me with a new rea&s;on for triumphing in my death, for I had rather have it &s;aid that I died by his vengeance, than that I lived by his mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you think nothing of the de|&s;tructive con&s;equences of war. How many cities mu&s;t be reduced to a&s;hes! how many families mu&s;t be ruined! and how many widows and orphans mu&s;t be made, &s;hould the pre&s;ent war be continued any longer with Great Britain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think of nothing but of the de&s;tructive con&s;equences of &s;lavery. The calamities of war are tran&s;itory and confined
<PB N="7" REF="014966_0162_0F954EC744F597A0">
in their effects. But the calamities of &s;la|very are exten&s;ive and la&s;ting in their ope|ration. I love mankind as well as you, and I could never re&s;train a tear when my love of ju&s;tice has obliged me to &s;hed the blood of a fellow creature. It is my hu|manity that makes me urge you again&s;t a reconciliation with Great Britain, for if this takes place, nothing can prevent the American Colonies from being the &s;eat of war as often as the King of Great Britain renews his quarrels with any of the Colo|nies, or with any of the belligerent powers of Europe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tremble at the doctrine you have advanced. I &s;ee you are for the indepen|dance of the Colonies on Great Britain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am for permanent liberty, peace, and &s;ecurity to the American Colo|nies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e can only be maintained by placing the Colonies in the &s;ituation they were in the year 1763.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is no &s;atisfaction to be made to the Colonies for the blood and trea&s;ure they have expended in re&s;i&s;ting the arms of Great Britain? Who can &s;often the prejudices of the King&mdash;the parliament&mdash;

and the nation, each of whom will be aver&s;e to maintain a peace with you in proportion to the advantages you have gained over them? Who &s;hall make re&s;titution to the widows&mdash;the mothers&mdash;and the children of the men who have been &s;lain by their arms? Can no hand wield the &s;ceptre of government in America except that which has been &s;tained with the blood of your countrymen? For my part if I thought this Continent would ever acknowledge the &s;o|vereignty of the Crown of Britain again, I &s;hould forever lament the day in which I offered up my life for its &s;alvation.</P>

<SP>

<P>I live in a world where all political &s;uper&s;tition is done away. The King is the author of all the mea&s;ures car|ried on again&s;t America. The influence of bad mini&s;ters is no better apology for the&s;e mea&s;ures, than the influence of bad com|pany is for a murderer, who expiates his crimes under a gallows.&mdash;You all complain of the corruption of the parliament, and of the venality of the nation, and yet you for|get that the Crown is the &s;ource of them both.&mdash;You &s;hun the &s;treams, and yet you
<PB N="9" REF="014966_0164_0F954EC8C2982F40">
are willing to &s;it down at the very fountain of corruption and venality.</P>

<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our di&s;tance and charters will pro|tect us from the influence of the crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your di&s;tance will only render your danger more imminent, and your ruin more irretrievable. Charters are no re&s;traints again&s;t the lu&s;t of power. The only rea&s;on why you have e&s;caped &s;o long is, becau&s;e the trea&s;ure of the nation has been employed for the&s;e 50 years in buying up the virtue of Britain and Ireland. Hereafter the &s;educ|tion of the repre&s;entatives of the people of America will be the only aim of admini&s;tra|tion &s;hould you continue to be connected with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I fore&s;ee many evils from the independance of the Colonies. Our trade will be ruined from the want of a navy to protect it. Each Colony will put in its claim for &s;uperiority, and we &s;hall have do|me&s;tic wars without end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I now know that Divine Providence intends this country to be the a&s;ylum of per&s;ecuted virtue from every quar|ter of the globe, &s;o I think your trade will be the vehicle that will convey it to you.
<PB N="10" REF="014966_0165_0F954ECA891A98D0">
Heaven has furni&s;hed you with greater re|&s;ources for a navy than any nation in the world. Nothing but an ignorance of your &s;trength could have led you to &s;acrifice your trade for the protection of a foreign navy. A freedom from the re&s;traints of the acts of navigation I fore&s;ee will produce &s;uch im|men&s;e additions to the wealth of this coun|try that po&s;terity will wonder that ever you thought your pre&s;ent trade worth its pro|tection. As to the &s;uppo&s;ed contentions between &s;i&s;ter colonies, they have no foun|dation in truth. But &s;uppo&s;ing they have, will delaying the independance of the Colo|nies, 50 years, prevent them? No&mdash;the weakne&s;s of the Colonies, which at fir&s;t produced their union, will always pre&s;erve it, 'till it &s;hall be their intere&s;t to be &s;eparat|ed. Had the Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-bay been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the military re&s;ources which it would probably have had 50 years hence, would &s;he have held out the &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s to her &s;i&s;ter colonies, upon the news of the Bo&s;ton port-bill? No&mdash;&s;he would have with&s;tood all the power of Britain alone, and afterwards the neutral colonies might have &s;hared the fate of the colony of Canada. Moreover, had the connection with Great-Britain
<PB N="11" REF="014966_0166_0F954ECAF7B33F30">
been continued 50 years longer, the progre&s;s of Briti&s;h laws, cu&s;toms, and man|ners (now totally corrupted) would have been &s;uch that the Colonies would have been prepared to welcome &s;lavery. But had it been otherwi&s;e, they mu&s;t have a&s;&s;erted their independance with arms. This is nearly done already. It will be cruel to be|queath another conte&s;t to your po&s;terity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I dread all innovations in go|vernments. They are very dangerous things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>The revolution, which gave a temporary &s;tability to the liberties of Bri|tain, was an innovation in government, and yet no ill con&s;equences have ari&s;en from it. Innovations are dangerous only as they &s;hake the prejudices of a people; but there are now, I believe, but few prejudices to be found, in this country, in favor of the old connection with Great-Britain. I ex|cept tho&s;e men only who are under the in|fluence of their pa&s;&s;ions and offices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it not mo&s;t natural for us to wi&s;h for a connection with a people who &s;peak the &s;ame language with us, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s the &s;ame laws, religion, and forms of government with our&s;elves.</P>

<P>The immortal Monte&s;quieu &s;ays, that nations &s;hould form alliances with tho&s;e nations only which are as unlike to them&s;elves as po&s;&s;ible in religion, laws and manners, if they mean to pre&s;erve their own con&s;titutions. Your dependance upon the crown is no advantage, but rather an in|jury, to the people of Britain, as it encrea&s;|es the power and influence of the King. The people are benefited only by your trade, and this they may have after you are inde|pendant of the crown. Should you be di&s;|po&s;ed to forgive the King and the nation for attempting to en&s;lave you, they will never forgive you for having baffled them in the attempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we have many friends in both Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean the mini&s;try have many enemies in Parliament who con|nect the cau&s;e of America with their cla|mours at the door of admini&s;tration. Lord Chatham's conciliatory bill would have ruin|ed you more effectually than Lord North's motion. The Marqui&s;s of Rockingham was the anthor of the declaratory bill. Mr. Wilkes has added infamy to the weakne&s;s

<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if we become independant we &s;hall become a commonwealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>I maintain that it is your in|tere&s;t to be independant of Great Britain, but I do not recommend any new form of government to you. I &s;hould think it &s;trange that a people who have virtue enough to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the mo&s;t powerful nation in the world &s;hould want wi&s;dom to contrive a perfect and free form of government. You have been kept in &s;ubjection to the crown of Britain by a miracle. Your liberties have hitherto been &s;u&s;pended by a thread. Your connection with Great-Britain is unnatural and unne|ce&s;&s;ary. All the wheels of a government &s;hould move within it&s;elf.&mdash;I would only beg leave to ob&s;erve to you, that monarchy and ari&s;tocracy have in all ages been the ve|hicles of &s;lavery.</P>

<P>Our governments will want force and authority if we become independant of Great-Britain.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg leave to contradict that a&s;&s;ertion. No royal edicts or acts of a&s;&s;embly have ever been more faithfully or univer&s;ally obeyed than the re&s;olves of the Congre&s;s. I admire the virtue of the co|lonies, and did not &s;ome of them &s;till hang upon the haggard brea&s;ts of Great-Britain, I &s;hould think the time now come in which they had virtue enough to be happy under any form of government. Remember that it is in a commonwealth only that you can expect to find every man a patriot or a hero. Ari&s;tides&mdash;Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">min<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">das&mdash;Pericles&mdash;Scipio-Camillus&mdash;and a thou&s;and other illu&s;trious Grecian and Roman heroes, would never have a&s;toni&s;hed the world with their names had they lived under royal governments.</P>

<P>Will not a declaration of indepen|dance le&s;&s;en the number of our friends, and encrea&s;e the rage of our enemies in Britain?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. Mont.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your friends as (you call them) are too few&mdash;too divided&mdash;and too in|tere&s;ted to help you. And as for your ene|mies, they have done their wor&s;t. They have called upon Ru&s;&s;ians&mdash;Hanoverians&mdash; He&s;&s;ians&mdash;Canadians&mdash;Savages-and Negroes to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in burning your towns&mdash;de&s;o|lating

Go, then, and awak|en the Congre&s;s to a &s;en&s;e of their import|ance; you have no time to lo&s;e. France waits for nothing but a declaration of your inde|pendance to revenge the injuries they &s;u&s;|&s;tained from Britain in the la&s;t war. But I forbear to rea&s;on any further with you. The decree is finally gone forth, Britain and America are now di&s;tinct empires. Your country teems with patriots&mdash;heroes&mdash; and legi&s;lators, who are impatient to bur&s;t forth into light and importance. Hereafter your atchievements &s;hall no more &s;well the page of Briti&s;h hi&s;tory. God did not excite the attention of all Europe&mdash;of the whole world&mdash;nay of angels them&s;elves to the pre&s;ent controver&s;y for nothing. The inhabitants of Heaven long to &s;ee the ark fini&s;hed, in which all the liberty and true religion of the world are to be depo&s;ited. The day in which the Colonies declare their independance will be a jubilee to Hampden&mdash;Sidney&mdash;Ru&s;&s;el&mdash;Warren&mdash;Gar|diner&mdash;Macpher&s;on&mdash;Chee&s;eman, and all the other heroes who have offered them&s;elves as &s;acrifices upon the altar of liberty.

I would rather die in <HI>attempting</HI> to obtain permanent freedom for a handful of people, than &s;ur|vive a conque&s;t which would &s;erve only to extend the empire of de&s;poti&s;m.
