<P>I HAD &s;carce uttered the words, when a poor monk of the order of St. Fran|cis came into the room to beg &s;omething for his convent. No man cares to have his virtues the &s;port of contingencies&mdash; or one man may be generous, as another man is pui&s;&s;ant&mdash;<HI>&s;ed non, quo ad hanc</HI>&mdash;or be it as it may&mdash;for there is no regular rea&s;oning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours; they may depend upon the &s;ame cau&s;es, for ought I know, which influence the tides them&s;elves&mdash;'twould oft be no di&s;credit to us, to &s;uppo&s;e it was &s;o: I am &s;ure at lea&s;t for my&s;elf, that in many a ca&s;e I &s;hould be more highly &s;atisfied, to have it &s;aid by the world, "I had had an affair with the moon, in which there was neither &s;in nor &s;hame," than have it pa&s;s altogether as my own

act and deed, wherein there was &s;o much of both.</P>
<P>&mdash;But be this as it may. The moment I ca&s;t my eyes upon him, I was predeter|mined not to give him a &s;ingle &s;ons; and accordingly I put my pur&s;e into my pock|et&mdash; buttoned it up&mdash;&s;et my&s;elf a little more upon my centre, and advanced up gravely to him: there was &s;omething, I fear, forbidding in my look: I have his figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which de&s;erved better.</P>
<P>The monk, as I judged from the break in his ton&s;ure, a few &s;cattered white hairs upon his temples, being all that remain|ed of it, might be about &s;eventy&mdash;but from his eyes, and that &s;ort of fire, which was in them, which &s;eemed more temper|ate by courte&s;y than years, could be no more than &s;ixty.&mdash;Truth might lie be|tween&mdash;He was certainly &s;ixty-five; and the general air of his countenance, not|with&s;tanding &s;omething &s;eemed to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</P>
<P>It was one of tho&s;e heads, which Guido has often painted&mdash;mild, pale&mdash;penetrat|ing, free from all common-place ideas of fat contented ignorance looking down|wards upon the earth&mdash;it looked forwards; but looked, as if it looked at &s;omething be|yond this world. How one of his order

came by it, heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk's &s;houlders, be&s;t knows: but it would have &s;uited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the plains of Indo&s;tan, I had reverenced it.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of his outline may be given in a few &s;trokes; one might put it into the hands of any one to de&s;ign, for 'twas nei|ther elegant or otherwi&s;e, but as charac|ter and expre&s;&s;ion made it &s;o: it was a thin, &s;pare form, &s;omething above the common &s;ize, if it lo&s;t not the di&s;tinction, by a bend forwards in the figure&mdash;but it was the attitude of intreaty; and as it now &s;tands pre&s;ented to my imagination, it gained more than it lo&s;t by it.</P>
<P>When he had entered the room three paces, he &s;tood &s;till; and laying his left hand upon his brea&s;t, (a &s;lender white &s;taff with which he journeyed being in his right)&mdash;when I had got clo&s;e up to him, he introduced him&s;elf with the lit|tle &s;tory of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order&mdash;and did it with &s;o &s;imple a grace,&mdash;and &s;uch an air of de|precation was there in the whole ca&s;t of his look and figure&mdash;I was bewitched not to have been &s;truck with it&mdash;</P>

<P>WHEN a man is di&s;contented with him&s;elf, it has one advantage how|ever, that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain. Now there being no travelling through France and Italy without a chai&s;e&mdash;and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fitte&s;t for, I walk'd out in|to the coach yard to buy or hire &s;ome|thing of that kind to my purpo&s;e: an old <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A chai&s;e, &s;o called in France, from its holding but one per&s;on.</NOTE> De&s;obligeant in the furthe&s;t corner of the court, hit my fancy at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;o I in&s;tantly got into it, and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings, I ordered the waiter to call Mon&s;ieur De&s;&s;ein the ma&s;ter of the hotel&mdash;but Mon&s;ieur De&s;&s;ein being gone to ve&s;pers, and not caring to face the Franci&s;can whom I &s;aw on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the court, in con|ference with a lady ju&s;t arrived, at the inn&mdash;I drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being determined to write my journey, I took out my pen and ink, and wrote the preface to it in the <HI>Di&s;obligeant.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE. IN THE DESOBLIGEANT.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t have been ob&s;erved by many a peripatetic philo&s;opher, that nature has &s;et up by her own unque&s;tionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circum&s;cribe the di&s;content of man: &s;he has effected her purpo&s;e in the quiet|e&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t manner by laying him under almo&s;t in&s;uperable obligations to work out his ea&s;e, and to &s;u&s;tain his &s;ufferings at home. It is there only that &s;he has provided him with the mo&s;t &s;uit|able objects to partake of his happine&s;s, and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages, has ever been too heavy for one pair of &s;houlders. 'Tis true we are endued with an imperfect power of &s;preading our happine&s;s &s;ome|times beyond <HI>her</HI> limits, but 'tis &s;o order|ed, that from the want of languages, connections, and dependencies, and from the difference in education, cu&s;toms and habits, we lie under &s;o many impedi|ments in communicating our &s;en&s;ations out of our own &s;phere, as often amount to a total impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>It will always follow from hence, that the balance of &s;entimental commerce is

always again&s;t the expatriated adventur|er: he mu&s;t buy what he has little occa|&s;ion for at their own price&mdash;his conver&s;a|tion will &s;eldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large di&s;count&mdash;and this, by the by, eternally driving him into the hands of more equitable brokers for &s;uch conver&s;ation as he can find, it requires no great &s;pirit of divination to gue&s;s at his party&mdash;</P>
<P>This brings me to my point; and na|turally leads me (if the &s;ee-&s;aw of this <HI>Di&s;obligeant</HI> will but let me get on) into the efficient as well as the final cau&s;es of travelling&mdash;</P>

<P>I Perceived that &s;omething darken'd the pa&s;&s;age more than my&s;elf, as I &s;tepp'd along it to my room; it was effec|tually Mon&s;.

fancy that it belong'd to &s;ome <HI>innocent traveller,</HI> who, on his return home, had left it to Mon&s;. De&s;&s;ein's honour to make the mo&s;t of. Four months had elap&s;ed &s;ince it had fini&s;h'd its career of Europe in the corner of Mon&s;.

<P>WHEN I told the reader that I did not care to get out of the <HI>De&s;obli|geant,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;aw the monk in clo&s;e conference with a lady ju&s;t arrived at the inn&mdash;I told him the truth; but I did not tell him the whole truth; for I was full as much re&s;trained by the appear|ance and figure of the lady he was talk|ing to. Su&s;picion cro&s;&s;ed my brain, and &s;aid, he was telling her what had pa&s;&s;ed: &s;omething jarred upon it within me&mdash;I wi&s;hed him at his convent.</P>
<P>When the heart flies out before the under&s;tanding, it &s;aves the judgment a world of pains&mdash;I was certain &s;he was of a better order of beings&mdash;however, I
<PB N="25" REF="041886_0025_101B63202284BF08">
thought no more of her, but went on and wrote my preface.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ion returned, upon my en|counter with her in the &s;treet; a guard|ed frankne&s;s with which &s;he gave me her hand, &s;hewed, I thought, her good educa|tion and her good &s;en&s;e; and as I led her on, I felt a plea&s;urable ductility about her, which &s;pread a calmne&s;s over all my &s;pirits&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;Good God! now a man might lead &s;uch a creature as this round the world with him!&mdash;</P>
<P>I had not yet &s;een her face&mdash;'twas not metarial; for the drawing was in&s;tantly &s;et about, and long before we had got to the door of the Remi&s;e, <HI>Fancy</HI> had fini&s;hed the whole head, and plea&s;ed her&s;elf as much with its &s;itting her godde&s;s, as if &s;he had dived into the TIBER for it&mdash;but thou art a reduced, and a &s;educing &s;lut; and albeit thou cheate&s;t us &s;even times a day with thy pictures and images, yet with &s;o many charms do&s;t thou do it, and thou decke&s;t out thy pictures in the &s;hapes of &s;o many angels of light, 'tis a &s;hame to break with thee.</P>
<P>When we had got to the door of the-Remi&s;e, &s;he withdrew her hand from acro&s;s her forehead, and let me &s;ee the original &mdash;it was a face of about &s;ix and twenty &mdash;of a clear tran&s;parent brown, &s;imply &s;et off without rouge or powder&mdash;it was

not critically hand&s;ome, but there was that in it, which in the frame of mind I was in which attached me much more to it&mdash;it was intere&s;ting; I fancied it wore the caracters of a widow'd look, and in that &s;tate of its declen&s;ion, which had pa&s;|&s;ed the two fir&s;t paroxy&s;ms of &s;orrow, and was quietly beginning to reconcile it&s;elf to its lo&s;s&mdash;but a thou&s;and other di&s;tre&s;&s;es might have traced the &s;ame lines; I wi&s;hed to know what they had been&mdash;and was ready to enquire, (had the &s;ame <HI>bon ton</HI> of conver&s;ation permitted, as in days of E&s;dras) "<HI>What aileth thee? and why art thou di&s;quieted? and why is thy under&s;tand|ing troubled?</HI>"&mdash;In a word, I felt benevo|lence for her; and re&s;olved &s;ome way or other to throw in my mite of courte&s;y&mdash; if not of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Such were my temptations&mdash;and in this di&s;po&s;ition to give way to them, was I left alone with the lady with her hand in mine, and with our faces both turned clo&s;er to the door of the Remi&s;e than what was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>THIS certainly, fair lady! &s;aid I rai&s;ing her hand up a little light|ly as I began, mu&s;t be one of fortune's whim&s;ical doings: to take two utter &s;trangers by their hands&mdash;of different &s;exes, and perhaps from different cor|ners of the globe, and in one moment place them together in &s;uch a cordial &s;i|tuation, as friend&s;hip her&s;elf could &s;carce have atchieved for them, had &s;he project|ed it for a month.</P>
<P>&mdash;And your reflection upon it, &s;hews how much, Mon&s;ieur, &s;he has embara&s;&s;ed you by the adventure.&mdash;</P>
<P>When the &s;ituation is, what we would wi&s;h, nothing is &s;o il-timed as to hint at the circum&s;tances which make it &s;o: you thank fortune, continued &s;he&mdash;you had rea&s;on&mdash;the heart knew it, and was &s;ati&s;|fied; and who but an Engli&s;h philo&s;opher would have &s;ent notices of it to the brain to rever&s;e the judgment?</P>
<P>In &s;aying this, &s;he di&s;engaged her hand with a look which I thought a &s;ufficient commentary upon the text.</P>
<P>It is a mi&s;erable picture which I am go|ing to give of the weakne&s;s of my heart, by owning, that it &s;uffered a pain, which

worthier occa&s;ions could not have inflict|ed.&mdash;I was mortified with the lo&s;s of her hand, and the manner in which I had lo&s;t it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound: I never felt the pain of a &s;heep|i&s;h inferiority &s;o mi&s;erably in my life.</P>
<P>The triumphs of a true feminine heart are &s;hort upon the&s;e di&s;comfitures. In a very few &s;econds &s;he laid her hand upon the the cuff of my coat, in order to fi|ni&s;h her reply; &s;o &s;ome way or other, God knows how, I regained my &s;itu|ation.</P>
<P>&mdash;She had nothing to add.</P>
<P>I forthwith began to model a different conver&s;ation for the lady. Thinking from the &s;pirit as well as the moral of this, that I had been mi&s;taken in her character; but upon turning her face to|wards me, the &s;pirit which had animat|ed the reply was fled&mdash;the mu&s;cles relax|ed, and I beheld the &s;ame unprotected look of di&s;tre&s;s which fir&s;t won me to her intere&s;t&mdash;melancholy! to &s;ee &s;uch &s;pright|line&s;s the prey of &s;orrow.&mdash;I pitied her from my &s;oul; and though it may &s;eem ridiculous enough to a torpid heart,&mdash;I could have taken her into my arms, and cheri&s;hed her, though it was in the open &s;treet, without blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>The pul&s;ations of the arteries along my fingers pre&s;&s;ing acro&s;s hers, told her what was pa&s;&s;ing within me: &s;he looked

down&mdash;a &s;ilence of &s;ome moments fol|lowed.</P>
<P>I fear, in this interval, I mu&s;t have made &s;ome &s;light efforts towards a clo&s;er compre&s;&s;ion of her hand, from a &s;ubtile &s;en&s;ation I felt in the palm of my own&mdash; not as if &s;he was going to withdraw hers &mdash;but, as if &s;he thought about it&mdash;and I had in&s;allibly lo&s;t it a &s;econd time, had not in&s;tinct more than rea&s;on directed me to the la&s;t re&s;ource in the&s;e dangers &mdash;to hold it loo&s;ely, and, in a manner as if I was every moment going to relea&s;e it, of my&s;elf; &s;o &s;he let it continue, till Mon|&s;ieur <HI>De&s;&s;ein</HI> returned with the key; and in the mean time I &s;et my&s;elf to con&s;ider how I &s;hould undo the ill impre&s;&s;ions which the poor monk's &s;tory, in ca&s;e he had told it her, mu&s;t have planted in her brea&s;t again&s;t me.</P>

&s;udden &s;top to La Fleur's career&mdash;his bidet would not pa&s;s by it&mdash; a contention aro&s;e betwixt them, and the poor fellow was kick'd out of his jack-boots the very fir&s;t kick.</P>
<P>La Fleur bore his fall like a French chri&s;tian, &s;aving neither more or le&s;s upon it, than, Diable! &s;o pre&s;ently got up and came to the charge again a&s;tride his bidet, beating him up to it as he would have beat his drum.</P>
<P>The bidet flew from one &s;ide of the road to the other, then back again&mdash;then this way&mdash;then that way, and in &s;hort every way but by the dead a&s;s.&mdash;La Fleur in&s;i&s;t|ed upon the thing&mdash;and the bidet threw him.</P>
<P>What's the matter, La Fleur, &s;aid I, with this bidet of thine?&mdash;<HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> &s;aid he <HI>c'e&s;t un cheval le plus opiniatre du monde</HI> &mdash;Nay, if he is a conceited bea&s;t, he mu&s;t go his own way, replied I&mdash;&s;o La Fleur got off him, and giving him a good &s;ound la&s;h, the bidet took me at my word, and away he &s;camper'd back to Montriul.&mdash; <HI>Pe&s;te</HI>! &s;aid La Fleur.</P>
<P>It is not <HI>mal a propos</HI> to take notice here, that tho' La Fleur availed him&s;elf but of two different terms of exclamation in this encounter&mdash;namely, <HI>Diable</HI>! and <HI>Pe&s;te</HI>! that there are neverthele&s;s three, in the French language; like the po&s;itive, com|parative, and &s;uperlative, one or the other
<PB N="59" REF="041886_0059_101B635089A24348" MS="y">
of which &s;erve for every unexpected throw of the dice in life.</P>
<P><HI>Le Diable</HI>! which is the fir&s;t, and po&s;itive degree, is generally u&s;ed upon ordinary emotions of the mind, where &s;mall things only fall out contrary to your expectati|ons&mdash;&s;uch as&mdash;the throwing once doublets &mdash;La Fleur's being kick'd off his hor&s;e, and &s;o forth&mdash;cuckoldom, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, is always <HI>Le Diable</HI>&punc;</P>
<P>But in ca&s;es where the ca&s;t has &s;ome|thing provoking in it, as in that of the bidet's running away after, and leaving La Fleur aground in jack-boots 'tis the &s;econd degree.</P>
<P>'Tis then <HI>Pe&s;te!</HI></P>
<P>And for the third&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;But here my heart is wrung with pity and fellow-feeling, when I reflect what mi&s;eries mu&s;t have been their lot, and how bitterly &s;o refined a people mu&s;t have &s;marted to have forced them upon the u&s;e of it.&mdash;</P>
<P>Grant me, O ye powers which touch the tongue with eloquence in di&s;tre&s;s! &mdash;whatever is my <HI>ca&s;t,</HI> grant me but de|cent words to exclaim in, and I will give my nature way.</P>
<P>&mdash;But as the&s;e were not to be had in France, I re&s;olved to take every evil ju&s;t as it befel me without an exclamation at all.</P>

with him&s;elf, followed the bidet with his eyes till it was got out of &s;ight &mdash;and then, you may imagine, if you plea&s;e, with what word he clo&s;ed the whole affair.</P>
<P>As there was no hunting down a frigh|ten'd hor&s;e in jack-boots, there remained no alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chai&s;e, or into it.&mdash;</P>

The poor &s;oul burn'd with impatience; and the Count de L***'s &s;ervant's coming with the letter, being the fir&s;t practicable occa&s;ion which offer|ed, La Fleur had laid hold of it; and in order to do honour to his ma&s;ter, had taken him into a back parlour in the Auberge, and treated him with a cup or two of the be&s;t wine in Picardy; and the Count de L***'s &s;ervant in return, and not to be behind hand in politene&s;s with La Fleur, had taken him back with him to the Count's h&ocirc;tel. La Fleur's <HI>preve|nancy</HI> (for there was a pa&s;&s;port in his very looks) &s;oon &s;et every &s;ervant in the kitch|en at ea&s;e with him; and as a French|man, whatever be his talents, has no &s;ort of prudery in &s;hewing them, La Fleur, in le&s;s than five minutes, had pull'd out his fife, and leading off the dance him&s;elf with the fir&s;t note, &s;et the <HI>fille de chambre,</HI>

the <HI>maitre d'hotel,</HI> the cook, the &s;ucllion, and all the hou&s;hold, dogs and cats, be|&s;ides an old monkey, a dancing: I &s;up|po&s;e there never was a merrier kitchen &s;ince the flood.</P>
<P>Madame de L***, in pa&s;&s;ing from her brother's apartment to her own, hearing &s;o much jollity below &s;tairs, rung up her <HI>fille de chambre</HI> to a&s;k about it; and hear|ing it was the Engli&s;h gentleman's &s;er|vant who had &s;et the whole hou&s;e merry with his pipe, &s;he ordered him up.</P>
<P>As the poor fellow could not pre&s;ent him&s;elf empty, he had loaden'd him&s;elf in going up &s;tairs with a thou&s;and com|pliments to Madame de L***, on the part of his ma&s;ter&mdash;added a long apocrypha of inquires after Madame de L***'s health &mdash;told her, that Mon&s;ieur his ma&s;ter was <HI>au de&s;e&s;poir</HI> for her re-e&s;tabli&s;hment from the fatigues of her journey&mdash;and, to clo&s;e all, that Mon&s;ieur had received the letter which Madame had done him the honour&mdash;and he has done me the honour, &s;aid Madame de L***, interrupting La Fleur, to &s;end a billet in return.</P>
<P>Madame de L*** had &s;aid this with &s;uch a tone of reliance upon the fact, that La Fleur had not power to di&s;appoint her expectations&mdash;he trembled for my honour &mdash;and po&s;&s;ibly might not altogether be unconcerned for his own, as a man capa|ble of being attach'd to a ma&s;ter who
<PB N="70" REF="041886_0070_101B63A8A8DBA3F8">
could be a wanting <HI>en egard vis a vis d'une femme</HI>; &s;o that when Madame de L*** a&s;ked La Fleur if he had brought a let|ter <HI>O qu'oui,</HI> &s;aid La Fleur: &s;o laying down his hat upon the ground, and taking hold of the flap of his right &s;ide pocket with his left hand, he began to &s;earch for the letter with his right&mdash;then contrary|wi&s;e&mdash;<HI>Diable!</HI>&mdash;then &s;ought every pocket&mdash;pocket by pocket, round, not forgetting his fob&mdash;<HI>Pe&s;te!</HI>&mdash;then La Fleur emptied them upon the floor&mdash;pulled out a dirty cravat&mdash;a handkerchief &mdash;a comb&mdash;a whip la&s;h&mdash;a night-cap&mdash; then gave a peep into his hat&mdash;<HI>Quelle etourderie!</HI> He had left the letter upon the table in the Auberge&mdash;he would run for it, and be back with it in three minutes.</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t fini&s;hed my &s;upper when La Fleur came in to give me an account of his adventure: he told the whole &s;tory &s;imply as it was; and only added, that if Mon&s;ieur had forgot (<HI>par hazard</HI>) to an|&s;wer Madame's letter, the arrangement gave him an opportunity to recover the <HI>faux pas</HI>&mdash;and if not, that things were only as they were.</P>
<P>Now I was not altogether &s;ure of my <HI>etiquette,</HI> whether I ought to have wrote or no; but if I had&mdash;a devil him&s;elf could not have been angry 'twas but the officious zeal of a well-meaning creature for my honour; and however he might

have mi&s;took the road&mdash;or embarra&s;&s;ed me in &s;o doing&mdash;his heart was in no fault &mdash;I was under no nece&s;&s;ity to write&mdash; and what weighed more than all&mdash;he did not look as if he had done ami&s;s.</P>
<P>&mdash;'Tis all very well, La Fleur, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>&mdash;'Twas &s;ufficient. La Fleur flew out of the room like lightening, and return'd with pen, ink, and paper, in his hand; and coming up to the table, laid them clo&s;e before me, with &s;uch a delight in his countenace, that I could not help taking up the pen.</P>
<P>I begun and begun again; and though I had nothing to &s;ay, and that nothing might have been expre&s;&s;ed in half a doz|en lines, I made half a dozen different beginnings, and could no way plea&s;e my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I was in no mood to write.</P>
<P>La Fleur &s;tepped out and brought a little water in a gla&s;s to dilute my ink&mdash; then fetched &s;and and &s;eal-wax&mdash;It was all one&mdash;I wrote and blotted, and tore off, and burnt, and wrote again&mdash;<HI>Le Diable l'empor|te!</HI> &s;aid I half to my&s;elf&mdash;I cannot write this &s;elf-&s;ame letter; throwing the pen down de&s;pairingly as I &s;aid it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had ca&s;t down the pen, La Fleur advanced with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful carriage up to the table, and making a thou&s;and apologies for the liberty he was going to take, told me he had a letter in

his pocket wrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporal's wife, which, he dur&s;t &s;ay, would &s;uit the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humour&mdash;Then prithee, &s;aid I, let me &s;ee it.</P>
<P>La Fleur in&s;tantly pulled out a little dirty pocket book crammed full of &s;mall letters and billet-doux in a &s;ad condition, and laying it upon the table, and then untying the &s;tring which held them all together, run them over one by one, till he came to the letter in que&s;tion&mdash;<HI>La voila!</HI> &s;aid he, clapping his hands: &s;o unfolding it fir&s;t, he laid it before me, and retired three &s;teps from the table whil&s;t I read it.</P>

<P>I own my fir&s;t &s;en&s;ations, as &s;oon as I was left &s;olitary and alone in my own chamber in the hotel, were far from being &s;o flattering as I had prefigured them.

<P>WHEN the barber came, he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to have any thing to do with my wig: 'twas either above or be|low his art: I had nothing to do, but to take one ready made of his own recom|mendation.</P>

<P>What a great &s;cale is every thing upon in this city! thought I&mdash;the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of an Engli&s;h periwig-maker's ideas could have gone no further than to have
<Q>dip|ped it into a pail of water</Q>
&mdash;What difference! 'tis like time to eternity.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I do hate all cold conceptions, as I do the puny ideas which engender them; and am generally &s;o &s;truck with the great works of nature, that for my own part, if I could help it, I never would make a compari&s;on le&s;s than a mountain at lea&s;t. All that can be &s;aid again&s;t the French &s;ublime in this in|&s;tance of it, is this&mdash;that the grandeur is <HI>more</HI> in the <HI>word;</HI> and <HI>le&s;s</HI> in the <HI>thing.</HI> No doubt the ocean fills the mind with va&s;t ideas; but Paris being &s;o far inland, it was not likely I &s;hould run po&s;t a hun|dred miles out of it, to try the experi|ment&mdash;the Pari&s;ian barber meant nothing.</P>
<P>The pail of water &s;tanding be&s;ides the great deep, makes certainly but a &s;orry figure in &s;peech&mdash;but 'twill be &s;aid&mdash;it has one advantage&mdash;'tis in the next room, and the truth of the buckle may be tried in it without more ado, in a &s;ingle mo|ment.</P>

<P>I was &s;o long in getting from under my barber's hands, that it was too late of thinking of going with my letter to Ma|dame R*** that night: but when a man is once dre&s;&s;ed at all points for going out, his reflections turn to little account, &s;o taking down the name of the Hotel de Modene where I lodged, I walked forth without any determination where to go&mdash; I &s;hall con&s;ider of that, &s;aid I, as I walk along.</P>

<P>I HAD never heard the remark made by any one in my life, except by one; and who that was, will probably come out in this chapter; &s;o that being pretty much unprepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, there mu&s;t have been grounds for what &s;truck me the moment I ca&s;t my eyes over the <HI>parterre</HI>&mdash;and that was, the unaccountable &s;port of na|ture in forming &s;uch numbers of dwarfs &mdash;No doubt, &s;he &s;ports at certain times in almo&s;t every corner of the world; but in Paris, there is no end to her amu&s;ements &mdash;The godde&s;s &s;eems almo&s;t as merry as &s;he is wi&s;e.</P>

<P>As this is not a work of rea&s;oning, I leave the &s;olution as I found it, and con|tent my&s;elf with the truth only of the remark, which is verified in every lane and by-lane of Paris.

hou&s;e is full, numbers of all ranks take &s;anctuary. Though you &s;tand, as in the parterre, you pay the &s;ame price as in the orche&s;tra. A poor defencele&s;s being of this order had got thru&s;t &s;ome how or other into this luckle&s;s place&mdash;the night was hot, and he was &s;urrounded by beings two feet and a half higher than him&s;elf. The dwarf &s;uffered inexpre&s;&s;ibly on all &s;ides; but the thing which incommoded him mo&s;t, was a tall corpulent German, near &s;even feet high, who &s;tood directly betwixt him and all po&s;&s;ibility of his &s;ee|ing either, the &s;tage or the actors. The poor dwarf did all he could to get a peep at what was going forwards, by &s;eeking for &s;ome little opening betwixt the Ger|man's arm and his body, trying fir&s;t one &s;ide, then the other; but the German &s;tood &s;quare in the mo&s;t unaccommodat|ing po&s;ture that can be imagined&mdash;the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepe&s;t draw-well in Paris; &s;o he civilly reached up his hand to the German's &s;leeve, and told him his di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;The German turned his head back, looked down upon him as Goliah did upon David&mdash;and unfeelingly re&s;um|ed his po&s;ture.</P>

<P>An injury &s;harpened by an in&s;ult, be it to who it will, makes every man of &s;en|timent a party: I could have leaped out of the box to have redre&s;&s;ed it.&mdash;The old French officer did it with much le&s;s confu&s;ion; for leaning a little over, and nodding to a centinel and pointing at the &s;ame time with his finger to the di&s;tre&s;s&mdash; the centinel made his way up to it.&mdash; There was no occa&s;ion to tell the griev|ance&mdash;the thing told it&s;elf; &s;o thru&s;ting back the German in&s;tantly with his mu&s;|ket&mdash;he took the poor dwarf by the hand and placed him before him.&mdash;This is no|ble! &s;aid I, clapping my hands together &mdash;And yet you would not permit this, &s;aid the old officer, in England.</P>

re-echoed from a do|zen different parts of the parterre, was as unintelligible to me, as my apo&s;tro|phe to the monk had been to him.</P>

<P>I had left London with &s;o much preci|pitation, that it never entered my mind that we were at war with France; and had reached Dover, and look'd through my gla&s;s at the hills beyond Boulovne, before the idea pre&s;ented it&s;elf; and with this in its train, that there was no get|ting

<P>I COULD not find in my heart to torture La Fleur's with a &s;erious look upon the &s;ubject of my embarra&s;&s;ment, which was the rea&s;on I had treated it &s;o cavalierly: and to &s;hew him how light it lay upon my mind, I dropt the &s;ubject en|tirely; and whil&s;t he waited upon me at &s;upper, talked to him with more than u&s;ual gaiety about Paris, and of the opera comique&mdash;La Fleur had been there him|&s;elf, and had followed me through the &s;treets as far as the book&s;eller's &s;hop; but &s;eeing me come out with the young <HI>fille de chambre,</HI> and that we walked down the Quai de Conti together, La Fleur deem'd it unnece&s;&s;ary to follow me a &s;tep further &mdash;&s;o making his own reflections upon it, he took a &s;horter cut, and got to the hotel in time to be informed of the affair of the Police again&s;t my arrival.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the hone&s;t creature had taken away, and gone down to &s;up him|&s;elf, I then began to think a little &s;eriou&s;|ly about my &s;ituation.&mdash;</P>

moment I was going to &s;et out&mdash;I mu&s;t tell it here.</P>
<P>Eugenius, knowing that I was as little &s;ubject to be overburthened with money as thought, had drawn me a&s;ide to inter|rogate me how much I had taken care for; upon telling him the exact &s;um, Eugenius &s;hook his head, and &s;aid it would not do; &s;o pulled out his pur&s;e in order to empty it into mine.&mdash;I've enough in con&s;cience, Eugenius, &s;aid I.&mdash;Indeed, Yorick, you have not, replied Eugenius&mdash; I know France and Italy better than you &mdash;But you don't con&s;ider, Eugenius, &s;aid I, refu&s;ing his offer, that before I have been three days in Paris, I &s;hall take care to &s;ay or do &s;omething or other for which I &s;hall get clapped up into the Ba&s;tile, and that I &s;hall live there a couple of months entirely at the king of France's expence.&mdash;I beg pardon, &s;aid Eugenius, drily: really, I had forgot that re&s;ource.</P>
<P>Now the event I treated gaily came &s;eriou&s;ly to my door.</P>
<P>Is it folly, or nonchalance, or philo&s;o|phy, or pertinacity&mdash;or what is it in me, that, after all, when La Fleur had gone down &s;tairs, and I was quite alone, that I could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwi&s;e than I had then &s;poken of it to Eugenius?</P>

<P>BEFORE I had got half-way down the &s;treet, I changed my mind: as I am at Ver&s;ailles, thought I, I might as well take a view of the town; &s;o I pulled the cord, and ordered the coachman to drive round &s;ome of the principal &s;treets &mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e the town is not very large, &s;aid I&mdash;The coachmen begged pardon for &s;etting me right, and told me it was very &s;uperb, and that numbers of the fir&s;t dukes and marqui&s;es and counts had hotels&mdash; The Count de B****, of whom the book|&s;eller at the Quai de Conti had &s;poke &s;o hand&s;omely the night before, came in|&s;tantly into my mind.&mdash;And why &s;hould I not go, thought I, to the Count de B**** who has &s;o high an idea of Engli&s;h books, and Engli&s;hmen&mdash;and tell him my &s;tory!
<PB N="25" REF="041886_0120_101B643059078050">
&s;o I changed my mind a &s;econd time&mdash;In truth it was the third; for I had intend|ed that day for Madame de R**** in the Rue St. Pierre, and had devoutly &s;ent her word by her <HI>fille de chambre</HI> that I would a&s;&s;uredly wait upon her&mdash;but I am govern|ed by circum&s;tances&mdash;I cannot govern them: &s;o &s;eeing a man &s;tanding with a ba&s;ket on the other &s;ide of the &s;treet, as if he had &s;omething to &s;ell, I bid La Fleur go up to him and enquire for the Count's hotel.</P>
<P>La Fleur returned a little pale; and told me it was a Chevalier de St. Louis &s;el|ling <HI>pates</HI>&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible, La Fleur! &s;aid I.&mdash;La Fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than my&s;elf; but per|&s;i&s;ted in his &s;tory: he had &s;een the croix &s;et in gold, with its red ribband, he &s;aid, tied to his button-hole&mdash;and had looked into the ba&s;ket and &s;een the <HI>pates</HI> which the Chevalier was &s;elling; &s;o could not be mi&s;taken in that.</P>
<P>Such a rever&s;e in man's life awakens a better principle than curio&s;ity: I could not help looking for &s;ome time at him as I &s;at in the <HI>remi&s;e</HI>&mdash;the more I looked at him&mdash;his croix and his ba&s;ket, the &s;trong|er they wove them&s;elves into my brain&mdash; I got out of the <HI>remi&s;e</HI> and went towards him.</P>
<P>He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and with a

&s;ort of a bib went half way up his brea&s;t; upon the top of this, but a little below the hem, hung his croix. His ba&s;ket of little <HI>pates</HI> was covered over with a white dama&s;k napkin; another of the &s;ame kind was &s;pread at the bottom; and there was a look <HI>proprete</HI> and neatne&s;s through|out; that one might have bought his <HI>pates</HI> of him, as much from appetite as &s;entiment.</P>
<P>He made an offer of them to neither: but &s;tood &s;till with them at the corner of a hotel, for tho&s;e to buy who cho&s;e it, without &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>He was about forty-eight&mdash;of a &s;edate look, &s;omething approaching to gravity. I did not wonder&mdash;I went up rather to the ba&s;ket than him, and having lifted up the napkin and taken one of his <HI>pates</HI> into my hand&mdash;I begged he would explain the appearance which affected me.</P>
<P>He told me in a few words, that the be&s;t part of his life had pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;er|vice, in which, after &s;pending a &s;mall patrimony, he had obtained a company and the croix with it; but that at the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t peace, his regiment being reformed, and the whole corps, with tho&s;e of &s;ome other regiments, left without any provi&s;ion&mdash;he found him&s;elf in a wide world without friends, without a livre&mdash;and indeed, &s;aid he, without any thing but this&mdash;(pointing, as he &s;aid it,

to his croix)&mdash;The poor Chevalier won my pity, and he fini&s;hed the &s;cene, with winning my e&s;teem too.</P>
<P>The king, he &s;aid, was the mo&s;t gene|rous of princes, but his genero&s;ity could neither relieve or reward every one, and it was only his misfortune to be among&s;t the number. He had a little wife, he &s;aid, whom he loved, who did the <HI>pati&s;|&s;erie;</HI> and added, he felt no di&s;honour in defending her and him&s;elf from want in this way&mdash;unle&s;s Providence had offer|ed him a better.</P>
<P>It would be wicked to with-hold a plea|&s;ure from the good, in pa&s;&s;ing over what happened to this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months after.</P>
<P>It &s;eems he u&s;ually took his &s;tand near the iron gates which lead up to the pa|lace, and as his croix had caught the eye of numbers, numbers had made the &s;ame enquiry which I had done&mdash;He had told them the &s;ame &s;tory, and always with &s;o much mode&s;ty and good &s;en&s;e, that it had reached at la&s;t the king's ears&mdash; who hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant officer, and re&s;pected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and integrity&mdash;he broke up his little trade by a pen&s;ion of fifteen hundred livres a year.</P>

<P>In any other province in France, &s;ave Britany, this was &s;miting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and af|fection

wi&s;hed to &s;ee re-blo&s;&s;om&mdash;But in Britany, there being a provi&s;ion for this, he availed him&s;elf of it; and taking an occa&s;ion when the &s;tates were a&s;&s;embled at Rennes, the Marquis, attended with his two boys, entered the court; and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy, which, though &s;eldom claimed, he &s;aid, was no le&s;s in force; he took his &s;word from his &s;ide&mdash;Here&mdash; &s;aid he&mdash;take it; and be tru&s;ty guardi|ans of it, till better times put me in con|dition to reclaim it.</P>

<P>As the fair <HI>fille de chambre</HI> was &s;o near my door &s;he turned back, and went into the room with me for a moment or two whil&s;t I wrote a card.</P>

<P>It was a tall figure of a philo&s;ophic &s;erious, a du&s;t look, which pa&s;&s;ed and re|pa&s;&s;ed &s;edately along the &s;treet, making a turn of about &s;ixty paces on each &s;ide of the gate of the hotel&mdash;the man was about fifty-two&mdash;had a &s;mall cane under his arm&mdash;was dre&s;&s;ed in a dark drab-co|loured coat, wai&s;tcoat, and breeches, which &s;eemed to have &s;een &s;ome years &s;ervice&mdash;they were &s;till clean, and there was a little air of frugal <HI>proprete</HI> though|out him.

his attitude of acco&s;ting a good many in his way, I &s;aw he was a&s;king charity; &s;o I got a &s;ous or two out of my pocket ready to give him, as he took me in his turn&mdash;he pa&s;&s;ed by me without a&s;king any thing&mdash;and yet did not go five &s;teps fur|ther before he a&s;ked charity of a little woman&mdash;I was much more likely to have given of the two&mdash;He had &s;carce done with the woman, when he pulled off his hat to another who was coming the &s;ame way.&mdash;An ancient gentleman came &s;low|ly&mdash;and, after him, a young &s;mart one &mdash;He let them both pa&s;s, and a&s;ked no|thing: I &s;tood ob&s;erving him half an hour, in which time he had made a do|zen turns backwards and forwards, and found that he invariably pur&s;ued the &s;ame plan.</P>
<P>There were two things very &s;ingular in this, which &s;et my brain to work and to no purpo&s;e&mdash;the fir&s;t was, why the man &s;hould <HI>only</HI> tell his &s;tory to the &s;ex&mdash;and &s;econdly&mdash;what kind of &s;tory it was, and what &s;pecies of eloquence it could be, which &s;oftened the hearts of the women, which he knew it was to no purpo&s;e to practice upon the men.</P>
<P>There were two other circum&s;tances which entangled this my my&s;tery&mdash;the one was, he told every woman what he had to &s;ay in her ear, and in a way which had much more the air of a &s;ecret than a

<P>I had covenanted at Montreal to give him a new hat with a &s;ilver button and loop, and four Louis d'ors <HI>pour s'adoni&s;er,</HI> when we got to Paris; and the poor fel|low, to do him ju&s;tice, had done wonders with it.</P>
<P>He had bought a bright, clean, good &s;carlet coat and a pair of breeches of the &s;ame&mdash;They were not a crown wor&s;e, he &s;aid, for the wearing&mdash;I wi&s;h'd him hang|ed

<P>This is a nicety which makes not the heart &s;ore at Paris.</P>
<P>He had purcha&s;ed moreover a hand|&s;ome blue &s;attin wai&s;tcoat, fancifully e|nough embroidered&mdash;this was indeed &s;omething the wor&s;e for the &s;ervices it had done, but 'twas clean &s;cour'd&mdash;the gold had been touch'd up, and upon the whole was rather &s;howy than otherwi&s;e&mdash;and as the blue was not violent, it &s;uited with the coat and breeches very well: he had &s;queez'd out of the money, moreover, a new bag and a &s;olitaire; and had in&s;i&s;ted with the <HI>fripier,</HI> upon a gold pair of gar|ters to his breeches knees&mdash;He had pur|cha&s;ed mu&s;lin ruffles, <HI>bien brodees,</HI> with four livres of his own money&mdash;and a pair of white &s;ilk &s;tockings for five more&mdash;and to top all, nature had given him a hand|&s;ome figure, without co&s;ting him a &s;ous.</P>
<P>He enter'd the room thus &s;et off, with his hair dre&s;s'd in the fir&s;t &s;tile, and with a hand&s;ome <HI>bouquet</HI> in his brea&s;t&mdash;in a word, there was that look of fe&s;tivity in every thing about him, which at once put me in mind it was Sunday&mdash;and by combining both together, it in&s;tantly

<P>He had brought the little print of but|ter upon a currant leaf; and as the morn|ing was warm, and he had a good &s;tep to bring it, he had begged a &s;heet of wa&s;te paper to put betwixt the currant leaf and his hand&mdash;As that was plate &s;ufficient, I bad him lay it upon the table as it was, and as I re&s;olved to &s;tay within all day I ordered him to call upon the <HI>traiteur</HI> to be&s;peak my dinner, and leave me to breakfa&s;t by my&s;elf.</P>

<P>The old man ro&s;e up to meet me, and with a re&s;pectful cordiality would have me &s;it down at the table; my heart was &s;at down the moment I entered the room; &s;o I &s;at down at once like a &s;on of the family: and to inve&s;t my&s;elf in the cha|racter as &s;peedily as I could, I in&s;tantly borrowed the old man's knife, and taking up the loaf cut my&s;elf a hearty lun|cheon; and as I did it I &s;aw a te&s;timony in every eye, not only of an hone&s;t wel|come, but of a welcome mixed with thanks that I had not &s;eemed to doubt it.</P>
<P>Was it this; or tell me, Nature, what el&s;e it was which made this mor&s;el &s;o &s;weet&mdash;and to what magick I owe it, that the draught I took of their flaggon was

&s;o delicious with it, that they remain upon my palate to this hour?</P>

<HEAD>THE GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN &s;upper was over, the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knife&mdash;to bid them pre|pare for the dance: the moment the &s;ignal was given, the women and girls ran all together into a back apartment to tye up their hair&mdash;and the young men to the door to wa&s;h their faces, and change their &s;abots; and in three minutes every &s;oul was ready upon a little e&s;planade be|fore the hou&s;e to begin&mdash;The old man and his wife came out la&s;t, and, placing me betwixt them, &s;at down upon a &s;opha of turf by the door.</P>
<P>The old man had &s;ome fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielle &mdash;and at the age he was then of, touched it well enough for the purpo&s;e. His wife &s;ung now-and-then a little to the tune&mdash; then intermitted&mdash;and joined her old man again as their children and grand|children danced before them.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="041886_0185_101B64D36E6EC3B8">It was not till the middle of the &s;econd dance, when, from &s;ome pau&s;es in the movement wherein they all &s;eemed to look up, I fancied I could di&s;tingui&s;t an elevation of &s;pirit different from that which is the cau&s;e or the effect of &s;imple jollity.&mdash;In a word, I thought I beheld <HI>Religion</HI> mixing in the dance&mdash;but as I had never &s;een her &s;o engaged, I &s;hould have look'd upon it now, as one of the il|lu&s;ions of an imagination which is eter|nally mi&s;leading me, had not the old man, as &s;oon as the dance ended, &s;aid, that this was their con&s;tant way; and that all his life long he had made it a rule, after &s;up|per was over, to call out his family to dance and rejoice; believing, he &s;aid, that a chearful and contented mind was the be&s;t &s;ort of thanks to heaven that an illi|terate pea&s;ant could pay&mdash;</P>

<P>WHEN you have gained the top of mount Taurira, you run pre&s;ently down to Lyons&mdash;adieu then to all rapid movements! 'Tis a journey of caution; and it fares better with &s;entiments, not to be in a hurry with them; &s;o I contract|ed with a Voiturin to take his time with

a couple of mules, and convey me in my own chai&s;e &s;afe to Turin through Sa|voy.</P>
<P>Poor, patient, quiet, hone&s;t people! fear not; your poverty, the trea&s;ury of your &s;imple virtues, will not be envied you by the world, nor will your vallies be invaded by it.&mdash;Nature! in the mid&s;t of thy di&s;orders, thou are &s;till friendly to the &s;cantine&s;s thou ha&s;t created&mdash;with all thy great works about thee, little ha&s;t thou left to give, either to the &s;cithe or to the &s;ickle&mdash;but to that little, thou grante&s;t &s;afety add protection; &s;weet are the dwellings which &s;tand &s;o &s;heltered.</P>
<P>Let the way-worn traveller vent his complaints upon the &s;udden turns and dangers of your roads&mdash;your rocks&mdash;your precipices&mdash;the difficulties of getting up&mdash;the horrors of getting down&mdash;moun|tains impracticable&mdash;and cataracts, which roll down great &s;tones from their &s;um|mits, and block up his road&mdash;The pea|&s;ants had been all day at work in remov|ing a fragment of this kind between St. Michael and Madane; and by the time my Voiturn got to the place, it wanted full two hours of compleating before a pa&s;&s;age could any how be gained: there was nothing but to wait with patience&mdash; 'twas a wet and tempe&s;tuous night; &s;o that by the delay, and that together, the Voiturin found him&s;elf obliged to take

up five miles &s;hort of his &s;tage at a little decent kind of an inn by the road &s;ide.</P>
<P>I forthwith took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my bed-chamber&mdash;got a good fire&mdash;ordered &s;up|per; and was thanking heaven it was no wor&s;e&mdash;when a voiture arrived with a lady in it and her &s;ervant-maid.</P>
<P>As there was no other bed-chamber in the hou&s;e, the ho&s;te&s;s, without much nicety led them into mine, telling them, as &s;he u&s;hered them in, that there was no body in it but an Engli&s;h gentleman&mdash; that there were two good beds in it, and a clo&s;et within the room which held a|nother&mdash;the accent in which &s;he &s;poke of this third bed did not &s;ay much for it&mdash; however, &s;he &s;aid, there were three beds, and but three people&mdash;and &s;he dur&s;t &s;ay, the gentleman would do any thing to ac|commodate matters&mdash;I left not the lady a moment to make a conjecture about it&mdash; &s;o in&s;tantly made a declaration I would do any thing in my power.</P>
<P>As this did not amount to an ab&s;olute &s;urrender of my bed-chamber, I &s;till felt my&s;elf &s;o much the proprietor, as to have a right to do the honours of it&mdash;&s;o I de|&s;ired the lady to &s;it down&mdash;pre&s;&s;ed her into the warme&s;t &s;eat&mdash;called for more wood&mdash;de&s;ired the ho&s;te&s;s to enlarge the plan of the &s;upper, and to favour us with the very be&s;t wine.</P>
<P>The lady had &s;carce warmed her&s;elf
<PB N="93" REF="041886_0188_101B6494C231CC50">
five minutes at the fire, before &s;he began to turn her head back, and give a look at the beds; and the oftener &s;he ca&s;t her eyes that way, the more they returned perplexed&mdash;I felt for her&mdash;and for my|&s;elf; for in a few minutes, what by her looks, and the ca&s;e it&s;elf, I found my&s;elf as much embarra&s;&s;ed as it was po&s;&s;ible the lady could be her&s;elf.</P>
<P>That the beds we were to lay in were in one and the &s;ame room, was enough &s;imply by it&s;elf to have excited all this&mdash; but the po&s;ition of them, for they &s;tood parallel, and &s;o very clo&s;e to each other as only to allow &s;pace for a &s;mall wicker chair bewtixt them, render'd the affair &s;till more oppro&s;&s;ive to us&mdash;they were fixed up moreover near the fire, and the projection of the chimney on one &s;ide, and a large beam which cro&s;s'd the room on the other, form'd a kind of rece&s;s for them that was no way favourable to the nicety of our &s;en&s;ations&mdash;if any thing could have added to it, it was, that the two beds were both of 'em &s;o very &s;mall, as to cut us off from every idea of the lady and maid lying together; which in either of them, could it have been fea&s;i|ble, my lying be&s;ides them, tho' a thing not to be wi&s;h'd, yet there was nothing in it &s;o terrible which the imagination might not have pa&s;s'd over without tor|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="041886_0189_101B64D8451FA928">As for the little room within, it offer'd little or no con&s;olation to us; 'twas a damp cold clo&s;et, with a half di&s;mantled window &s;hutter, and with a window which had neither gla&s;s or oil paper in it to keep out the tempe&s;t of the night. I did not en|deavour to &s;tifle my cough when the lady gave a peep into it; &s;o it reduced the ca&s;e in cour&s;e to this alternative&mdash;that the lady &s;hould &s;acrifice her health to her felings, and take up with the clo&s;et her&s;elf, and abandon the bed next mine to her maid &mdash;or that the girl &s;hould take the clo&s;et, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The lady was a Piedmonte&s;e of about thirty, with a glow of health in her cheeks.&mdash;The maid was a Lyono&s;e of twenty, and as bri&s;k and lively a French girl as ever moved.&mdash;There were difficul|ties every way&mdash;and the ob&s;tacle of the &s;tone in the road, which brought us into the di&s;tre&s;s, great as it appeared whil&s;t the pea&s;ants were removing it, was but a pebble to what lay in our ways now&mdash;I have only to add, that it did not le&s;&s;en the weight which hung upon our &s;pirits, that we were both too delicate to com|municate what we felt to each other up|on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;at down to &s;upper; and had we not had more generous wine to it than a little inn in Savoy cold have furni&s;h'd, our tongues had been tied up, till nece&s;&s;i|ty

her&s;elf had &s;et them at liberty&mdash;but the lady having a few bottles of Burdun|dy in her voiture &s;ent down her Fille de Chambre for a couple of them; &s;o that by the time &s;upper was over, and we were left alone, we felt our&s;elves in&s;pired with a &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient to talk, at lea&s;t, without re&s;erve upon our &s;ituati|on. We turn'd it every way, and debat|ed and con&s;idered it in all kind of lights in the cour&s;e of a two hours negociati|on; at the end of which the articles were &s;ettled finally betwixt us, and &s;tipulated for in form and manner of a treaty of peace&mdash;and I believe with as much religi|on and good faith on both &s;ides, as in any treaty which as yet had the honour of being handed down to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>They were as follows:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. As the right of the bedchamber is in Mon&s;ieur&mdash;and he thinking the bed next to the fire to be the warme&s;t, he in&s;i&s;ts upon the conce&s;&s;ion on the lady's &s;ide of taking up with it.</P>
<P>Granted, on the part of Madame; with a provi&s;o, that as the curtains of that bed are of a flim&s;y tran&s;parent cotton and appear likewi&s;e too &s;canty to draw clo&s;e, that the Fille de Chambre, &s;hall fa&s;t|en up the opening, either by corking pins, or needle and thread, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be deemed a &s;ufficient barrier on the &s;ide of Mon&s;ieur.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="96" REF="041886_0191_101B64DCE875AE68">2dly. It is required on the part of Ma|dame, that Mon&s;ieur &s;hall lay the whole night through in his robe de chambre.</P>
<P>Rejected: ina&s;much Mon&s;ieur is not worth a robe de chambre; he having no|thing in his portmanteau but &s;ix &s;hirts and a black &s;ilk pair of breeches.</P>
<P>The mentioning the &s;ilk pair of breeches made an entire change of the articles&mdash; for the breeches were accepted as an equivalent for the robe de chambre, and &s;o it was &s;tipulated and agreed upon that I &s;hould lay in my black &s;ilk breeches all night.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, It was in&s;i&s;ted upon, and &s;tipu|pulated for by the lady, that after Mon|&s;ieur was got to bed, and the candle and fire extingui&s;hed, that Mon&s;ieur &s;hould not &s;peak one &s;ingle word the whole night.</P>
<P>Granted; provided Mon&s;ieur's &s;aying his prayers might not be deem'd an in|fraction of treaty.</P>
<P>There was but one point forgot in this treaty, and that was the manner in which the lady and my&s;elf &s;hould be obliged to undre&s;s and get to bed&mdash;there was but one way of doing it, and that I leave to the reader to devi&s;e; prote&s;ting as I do it, that if it is not the mo&s;t delicate in na|ture, 'tis the fault of his own imaginati|on&mdash;again&s;t which this is not my fir&s;t complaint.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="041886_0192_101B649C1F5FA978">Now when we were got to bed, whe|ther it was the novelty of the &s;ituation, or what it was, I know not; but &s;o it was, I could not &s;hut my eyes; I tried this &s;ide and that, and turn'd and turn'd again, till a full hour after midnight; when na|ture and patience both wearing out&mdash;O my God! &s;aid I&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;You have broke the treaty, Mon&s;ieur, &s;aid the lady, who had no more &s;lept than my&s;elf&mdash;I begg'd a thou&s;and pardons&mdash; but in&s;i&s;ted it was no more than an eja|culation&mdash;&s;he maintain'd 'twas an entire infraction of the treaty&mdash;I maintained it was provided for in the clau&s;e of the third article.</P>
<P>The lady would by no means give up her point, tho' &s;he weakened her barrier by it; for in the warmth of the di&s;pute, I could hear two or three corking pins fall out of the curtain to the ground.</P>
<P>Upon my word and honour, Madame, &s;aid I&mdash;&s;tretching my arm out of bed by way of a&s;&s;everation&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;(I was going to have added, that I would not have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the re|mote&s;t idea of decorum for the world)&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;But the Fille de Chambre hearing there were words between us, and fear|ing that ho&s;tilities would en&s;ue in cour&s;e, had crept &s;ilently out of her clo&s;et, and it being totally dark, had &s;tolen &s;o clo&s;e to our beds, that &s;he had got her&s;elf into
<PB N="98" REF="041886_0193_101B64DEB0506880">
the narrow pa&s;&s;age which &s;eparated them, and had advanced &s;o far up as to be in a line betwixt her mi&s;tre&s;s and me.&mdash;</P>
<P>So that when I &s;tretched out my hand, I caught hold of the Fille de Chambre's.</P>
