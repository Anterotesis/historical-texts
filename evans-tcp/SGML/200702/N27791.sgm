<HEAD>A BRIEF NARRATIVE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON a subject of this important magnitude, in which the Public Mind is irresistibly interested; where a transaction is to be developed, the mere contemplation of which makes the soul shudder with horror; where the guilt or innocence is to be ascertained, of a man crimina|ted with an accusation of &s;uch diabolic import, we deem it our <HI>duty</HI> to give the earliest information in our power.</P>
<P>Is he guilty, let the culprit be held up to public detes|tation in all his blackne&s;s, and receive the punishment of his crime; but if innocent, let the unfortunate youth re|ceive as public an acquittal. Let us wipe from his fair fame every foul stain of suspicion&mdash;let us regret that his character has been traduced, his feelings lacerated, his very existence endangered by an accu&s;ation as fal&s;e as it was cruel, as unfounded as it was destructive.</P>
<P>This celebrated cau&s;e brought forth the talents, as well of the pro&s;ecutor for the people, as of the advocates for the prisoner. But the profe&s;sional activity of the former,
<PB N="4" REF="037039_0003_100C8AB341956540">
was not the only power with which the unfortunate pri|&s;oner had to cope.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and rumors of a vague and incongruous nature, were circulated by the tongue of public report. Ab&s;urd and malignant stories were at every corner repeated, cal|culated to prejudice the public mind.</P>
<P>It is unfortunately too common for the le&s;s liberal part of the community, to transfer their abhorrence of the <HI>crime</HI> to the <HI>per&s;on</HI> who is &s;u&s;pected of its commi&s;sion; forgetful of that golden maxim, that we should deem e|very man innocent, until, to an impartial jury of his fellow citizens, his guilt is made manifest.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o heard, but for the honor of human na|ture we hope our information is not correct, that one or more di&s;intere&s;ted individuals, have exerted them&s;elves with peculiar activity to procure the conviction of the pri|&s;oner.</P>
<P>However de&s;irous we may be that truth should be dis|covered, and crime brought under the &s;word of ju&s;tice&mdash; and however we may applaud the exertions of tho&s;e who&s;e profe&s;sional duty calls on them to drag the a&s;sa&s;&s;in from his concealment into open day; yet our feelings recoil at the idea of <HI>intruding</HI> &s;ervices in a ca&s;e where the life of the pri&s;oner is at stake&mdash;where a conviction will crim&s;on the altar of public ju&s;tice with the blood of a fel|low creature.</P>
<P>But we cut short our preliminary remarks, and ha&s;ter to the more important occurrences of the trial.</P>
<P>A bill having been found by the grand jury, and the pri&s;oner duly arraigned, Monday was appointed as the awful&mdash;the eventful aera of his fate&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="037039_0004_100C8AB5E22E84D0">On this momentous occa&s;ion, the chamber of ju&s;tice, the avenues of the city-hall, and the &s;treets adjacent, were thronged with an eager multitude of our enlight|ened populace;&mdash;A multitude, who&s;e patience was only equalled by their clemency.</P>
<P>Preci&s;ely at ten o'clock, the &s;un &s;hining with con&s;ider|able brilliancy, and the weather being a little windy, the pri&s;oner arrived, properly guarded. He was also attended by a numerous train, a volunteer guard of citi|zens, as di&s;tinguished for decorum of behavior, as for re&s;pectability of appearance.</P>
<P>The court being opened in due form, and the jury &s;worn, the pri&s;oner was brought to the bar.</P>
<P>Here let us remark the collected compo&s;ure of his manner, and the open expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance. His appearance intere&s;ted us greatly in his favor. We waited with anxiety for the te&s;timony&mdash;convinced that if his was not the expre&s;&s;ion of con&s;cious innocence, he was indeed a man incapable of feeling, who&s;e bo&s;om was not to be a&s;&s;ailed by any remor&s;eful &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>The court room being exce&s;&s;ively crowded, the con|&s;tables were directed to clear it of all &s;uperfluous &s;pec|tators; and we were much delighted to &s;ee the alacrity with which this re&s;pectable cla&s;s of officers exerted them|&s;elves, in the execution of the power delegated to them; &mdash;an alacrity which we have in every in&s;tance witne&s;&s;ed. They appear fully convinced of the authority they po&s;|&s;e&s;s, and perfectly di&s;po&s;ed to exerci&s;e it in its ample&s;t extent.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner being placed at the bar, was then called by name, and directed to hold up his <HI>right hand.</HI> Hav|ing complied with this e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age, his indictment was read, in which the accu&s;ation was contained, a|mong
<PB N="6" REF="037039_0005_100C8AB8239CB300">
a number of other important and truly relevant allegations cu&s;tomary on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Attorney general then opened the pro&s;ecution, and introduced the witne&s;ses on the part of the people. These being fifty or sixty in number, and many of them depo&s;ing matters of trivial import, we &s;hall not go into the detail; but merely remark, that the general tenor went to connect circum&s;tances of a pre&s;umptive nature; but which &s;o connected, might e&s;tabli&s;h a conclu&s;ive ma&s;s. The nature of the ca&s;e being &s;uch, that in proof of the pri&s;oner's guilt, pre&s;umptive evidence only could be ad|duced.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony was brought forward to e&s;tabli&s;h certain particulars which, if properly proved, would have formed a connected chain of evidence, from which <HI>pre&s;umption</HI> would ari&s;e &s;ufficiently pointed to <HI>convince</HI> the <HI>minds</HI> of the jury, producing the &s;ame con|viction of his guilt, that would ari&s;e from <HI>po&s;itive</HI> te&s;ti|mony. But if the&s;e proofs were rebutted, or differ|ently explained by oppo&s;ing te&s;timony, it would fol|low, that the mo&s;t violent &s;u&s;picions might originate from circum&s;tances of a harmle&s;s nature, and the mo&s;t pointed evidence might take its ri&s;e in error and mi&s;con|ception.</P>
<P>The following is the import of the material part of this evidence, which we have &s;elected from a confu&s;ed ma&s;s of tedious unimportant matter.</P>
<P>It was endeavored on the part of the pro&s;ecution to prove, that the pri&s;oner had been in the habit of paying very particular attentions to the decea&s;ed&mdash;that about 8 o'clock of the evening on which &s;he was mi&s;sing, he had come to her uncle's, where &s;he resided, and had de|parted about the &s;ame time at which &s;he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have left the hou&s;e, which was about twenty minutes af|ter
<PB N="7" REF="037039_0006_100C8ABAEF910080">
eight o'clock. A woman living in the neighborhood of the yard in which the hor&s;e and &s;leigh of Ezra Weeks, brother to the pri&s;oner, were kept, depo&s;ed, that &s;ome|time about eight o'clock, being in her hou&s;e, with her doors &s;hut, &s;he heard the gate of the above yard open, and a carriage come out, whether a &s;leigh or chair, &s;he could not tell, and in about half an hour, &s;he heard it return, and the gate again &s;hut. She admitted that &s;he had never heard this gate open or &s;hut, except at this particular time, though it was in continual u&s;e&mdash;&s;he was al&s;o certain that the evening was Sunday, though &s;he ap|peared very incorrect with re&s;pect to the time of the month. She al&s;o admitted that &s;he did not recollect any of tho&s;e particulars till about twelve days after, when &s;he was informed of the unfortunate end of the young woman, and of the time when the event happened. It is al&s;o to be noted, that this witne&s;s appeared to be greatly advanced in age, and her memory not very tenacious on mo&s;t particulars.</P>
<P>An evidence was adduced to prove, that about the time mentioned, a one hor&s;e &s;leigh without bells, was &s;een on the road, containing a woman and two men, who ap|peared laughing very merrily.</P>
<P>Three other witne&s;&s;es depo&s;ed that about half after eight o'clock, being in a &s;leigh in the middle road, a one hor&s;e &s;leigh pa&s;&s;ed them on a gallop, without bells, and containing two or three persons, but from the darkne&s;s of the night, they were not able to speak decidedly as to the number, nor were they certain as to the &s;ex of all the per&s;ons it contained. As the sleigh pa&s;sed them, the witne&s;ses huzza'd, in the manner frequently cu&s;tomary on &s;uch occasions. The per&s;ons in the one hor&s;e sleigh took no notice of their &s;houting, but pa&s;sed them in per|fect silence.</P>
<P>Two witne&s;ses, a man and his wife, who reside in the
<PB N="8" REF="037039_0007_100C8ABC807C4098">
vicinity of the Manhattan Well, being regularly &s;worn, declared, that about tbe hour in which this cata&s;trophe is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened, they heard exclamations of a female in di&s;tre&s;s, and di&s;tingui&s;hed the words "O Lord have mercy, do help me!" The old man looked through his window; but on being a&s;ked, declared that he did not di&s;cover any sleigh; though it was ob&s;erved that from the nature of the ground, it was not <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> but a sleigh might have been kept from his view in a kind of hollow between his hou&s;e and the well.</P>
<P>Another witne&s;s depo&s;ed, that he pa&s;&s;ed not far from the Manhattan Well about <HI>nine</HI> o'clock.</P>
<P>The time was a&s;certained by his having noticed the hour a few minutes before, at the hou&s;e he left.</P>
<P>He heard a voice, as of a female in di&s;tre&s;s, and went in the direction of the Well to discover the cause. He heard the voice twice, but did not di&s;tingui&s;h any words. His wife called him, and told him &s;he believed it came from a hou&s;e in the neighborhood&mdash;he therefore desi&s;ted from his examination. He declared that he &s;aw no &s;leigh, and the &s;ounds were not again repeated.</P>
<P>Another witne&s;s depo&s;ed, that pa&s;&s;ing near the well the morning after the event, he &s;aw the traces of a one-hor&s;e &s;leigh, which had went out of the road and &s;truck into the field, turning extremely near to the well. He remarked, that the circum&s;tance being very &s;ingular, ar|re&s;ted his attention: he did not perceive whether it bore the marks of a plea&s;ure &s;leigh, or a wood &s;leigh. The latter appeared to have been the impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, as he thought that some carmen, riding for &s;port, had turned out of the road through whim.</P>
<P>From the unfrequented nature of the ground, it being out of the common road, the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner
<PB N="9" REF="037039_0008_100C8ABE10A5A860">
di&s;covered, by their que&s;tions, their opinion that the&s;e traces of a &s;leigh might not have been made on the pre|ceding night.</P>
<P>Two other circum&s;tances were adduced, which ap|peared at fir&s;t view, extremely unfavorable to the pri|&s;oner.</P>
<P>He had declared, that he had never been at the well in his life, and a witne&s;s was brought to prove, that he had &s;een him examining the depth of the well, a week before this unfortunate circum&s;tance occurred. This evidence depo&s;ed, that about eleven o'clock on a Sun|day morning, a week before the young woman was mi&s;|&s;ing, he &s;aw a young man by the well, with whom he had &s;ome conver&s;ation; and this young man fa&s;tening two pieces of wood together, which had been left from the wood work, &s;ounded the well in different places, mentioning to him the depth. But the witne&s;s declined &s;wearing to the identity of the per&s;on, declaring that he could not take his oath that the pri&s;oner was the man.&mdash; He al&s;o de&s;cribed accurately the dre&s;s of the per&s;on he &s;aw at the well, which happened to be particularly &s;in|gular.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who lived in the hou&s;e with the pri&s;oner, and the man with whom he boarded, being called, de|clared that they had never &s;een clothes of this de&s;crip|tion in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The attorney general &s;eeing the incompetence of this te&s;timony, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The other unfavorable circum&s;tance was, that the pri&s;oner, immediately on being taken, asked if they had found the body in the MANHATTAN WELL.</P>
<P>But it was proved by &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, that the muff
<PB N="10" REF="037039_0009_100C8AC0782AE418">
of the decea&s;ed being di&s;covered, had led to a &s;u&s;picion that her remains would be found in the well. It was also <HI>clearly proved,</HI> that this circum&s;tance of the finding of the muff, had <HI>already</HI> been communicated to the pri|&s;oner.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the material evidences again&s;t the pri&s;oner; To &s;ave time we have accompanied &s;ome of them with the manner in which they were opposed or proved groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>The evidence on the part of the pri&s;oner was opened by Colonel Burr, in an eloquent and ma&s;terly manner.</P>
<P>It went to prove, that he was a young man of much worth, of mild and amiable manners, and of a very gentle and affectionate di&s;po&s;ition. Several witne&s;&s;es were brought to &s;hew, that his conduct to the unfortu|nate young woman in que&s;tion, had been civilly atten|tive&punc; but not more &s;o than to other young women in the hou&s;e, or than was con&s;i&s;tent with propriety.</P>
<P>It was clearly proved by a number of witne&s;&s;es, that he was at Mr. Ezra Weeks, his brother's, on that even|ing, from before candle-light till eight o'clock. It was proved by a witne&s;s who lodged in the family of the decea&s;ed, that he came home about two minutes before or after eight o'clock: that the pri&s;oner, with the de|cea&s;ed and family, were together: that &s;hortly after, one of the company looking at his watch, it was ten minutes after eight: that about four minutes after this circum|&s;tance, he left the room. It appears from the evidence of the family, that about this time, the pri&s;oner took his leave; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed by the family, that the young woman, who had gone up &s;tairs, went away with him. This from the evidence, mu&s;t have been about a <HI>quarter</HI> after eight.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037039_0010_100C8AC268C6D3D8">It was further proved, that &s;ome company who had been at Mr. Ezra Weeks's, (the brother of the pri&s;oner) remained with him till about twenty or twenty-five mi|nutes after eight, when they departed; and in con&s;e|quence of the darkne&s;s and &s;lipperine&s;s of the evening, Mr. Ezra Weeks &s;tood at the door with the candle, and lighted them. He returned, but had not &s;at down be|fore his brother, the pri&s;oner, came in as u&s;ual, to re|ceive directions for the work of the next day. The interval unaccounted for, of the pri&s;oner's ab&s;ence, was thus reduced to ten or fifteen minutes; in which time, if at all, he mu&s;t have perpetrated the crime&mdash;mu&s;t have gone to the Manhattan well, about a mile, and returned; and mu&s;t have compo&s;ed his appearance, and overcome all kind of agitation, and all signs of ha&s;te or exertion.</P>
<P>It was proved by evidence, that the sleigh of Mr. Ezra Weeks had bells: that the boy who took care of the hor&s;e had &s;ed him as u&s;ual, locked the door, and ei|ther kept the key in his pocket, or placed it in the kitchen. It appears that the bells were on the harne&s;s before and after this tran&s;action, and in the opinion of the lad who had the care of the hor&s;e, it would have taken about ten minutes to remove the bells from the harne&s;s, and put the hor&s;e to the sleigh.</P>
<P>It was &s;atisfactorily proved by numerous witne&s;ses, that the behavior of the pri&s;oner in the evening prior to the young woman being mi&s;sing, was perfectly compo&s;ed and cheerful as u&s;ual. It appears that on his return, his conduct was the &s;ame, perfectly free from every kind of agitation, that he eat a hearty &s;upper, and received di|rections for making 8 doors of different dimensions, and executed them accurately without further in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>It al&s;o was proved, by a per&s;on who worked in the &s;ame &s;hop with him, and who having heard &s;ome &s;urmi&s;es
<PB N="12" REF="037039_0011_100C82A2723C9498">
hinted to his di&s;advantage, paid very particular attention to his appearance; that his &s;ub&s;equent conduct was uni|formly the same as ever; that he paid the same attention to the superintendance of the work, and never exhibited the smalle&s;t sign of guilt or agitation.</P>
<P>A variety of other witne&s;ses were brought forward&mdash; some invalidating the te&s;timony brought again&s;t him and others, tending to e&s;tabli&s;h his innocence; but tho&s;e al|ready detailed, appeared to remove every doubt from the minds of the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>The evidence of &s;everal medical gentlemen of re&s;pect|ability, who had examined the body, was also taken; as was likewi&s;e the profe&s;&s;ional opinion of a physician of eminence, who had not in&s;pected it.</P>
<P>From their te&s;timony, it would appear po&s;&s;ible, that the decea&s;ed had received her death from drowning, without having &s;u&s;tained any previous violence.</P>
<P>Some evidence was produced to show, that for a short time prior to her unfortunate end, she had exhibited marks of occasional gloom and melancholy; but several witne&s;ses also deposed to the gaiety and cheerfulne&s;s of her disposition.</P>
<P>As the counsel for the pri&s;oner did not sum up, we had not an opportunity of judging how far they meant to enforce this point; and we could only infer the con|clusion they were disposed to draw.</P>
<P>The evidence on both sides being closed, we anticipated that flow of eloquence which was to be expected from the abilities of General Hamilton and Brockhol&s;t Living&s;ton, for the prisoner, and of Mr. Colden, the prosecutor for the people.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037039_0012_100C8AC6095684A8">But the Attorney general rose and reque&s;ted that the court would po&s;tpone the pleadings on the cause, ex|pre&s;sing his inability of entering into it at this hour, de|claring that he had not slept in eight and forty hours; and that if after hearing the summing up of the gentlemen for the prisoner, he was obliged at five or six o'clock in the morning to enter upon a reply, in which he mu&s;t consider the evidence, it would be totally out of his power.</P>
<P>The harra&s;&s;ed appearance of the attorney general, sufficiently sub&s;tantiated his a&s;&s;ertions, as he appeared sinking under the fatigues he had suffered in the course of this lengthy trial.</P>
<P>The court declined a compliance with this reque&s;t, alledging the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the jury, who had alrea|dy been locked up one night in the picture room, and that if the court adjourned, the jury mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be committed to the &s;ame kind of durance, and that two nights pa&s;&s;ed in this manner, might make &s;ome of them sick, and prevent a determination of the cause.</P>
<P>We heartily concurred with the court in opinion; for though the examinations of the paintings, must doubt|le&s;s have been very edifying and amusing to the jury on the former night, yet it is doubtful whether a repetition of the pleasure, would not have been so exquisite as to have produced a cloying effect.</P>
<P>The counsel for the pri&s;oner expre&s;&s;ed their opinion that the merits of the cause, by no means required any length of time in &s;umming up the evidence; and propo|&s;ed leaving the matter to the court and jury without fur|ther comment. This propo&s;al was accordingly acceded to.</P>
<P>Chief ju&s;tice Lansing, then aro&s;e and delivered a ju|dicious
<PB N="14" REF="037039_0013_100C8AC7C935BE08">
and appropriate charge to the jury. He declined going into the ma&s;s of the evidence, but detailed the most &s;triking and important testimony; &s;howing the de|ficiency of motives to induce the pri&s;oner to the commi&s;|&s;ion of the crime, entering into con&s;ideration of the mo&s;t material evidence again&s;t him, and evincing the opinion of the court, of its deficiency to prove the guilt of the pri&s;oner. He concluded, by directing them to decide ac|cording to the conviction produced in their own minds, by the evidence produced, without being bia&s;&s;ed, by any report they might have heard circulated, before their arrival at court, or by any regard to the consequences which would result to the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The jury retired, and returned in le&s;s than two min|utes; their names were then called over; the prisoner was ordered to hold up his right hand, and having again complied with this e&s;tabli&s;hed and important custom. The jury pronounced him NOT GUILTY.</P>
<P>We again remark the pri&s;oner's collected behavior thro' the whole course of the trial&mdash;the perfect innocence and artle&s;sne&s;s of his countenance. Guilt could never have lurked under &s;uch a conduct. His face appeared the in|dex of a virtuous and benevolent heart; his deportment that of a man incapable of the smalle&s;t approach to the crimes with which error had accused him.</P>
<P>We participated in the indignation excited by the per|secution he had suffered&mdash;by the malignant attempts which had been made to inflame the public mind, and prejudge his cause. The most shameful falshoods had been circulated. A &s;tory had been spread abroad res|pecting a witne&s;s in New-Jersey, who had come forward and confe&s;&s;ed himself an acce&s;&s;ary in the murder.</P>
<P>This tale was de&s;titute of the smalle&s;t foundation, and perhaps originated in the sanguinary malice of some
<PB N="15" REF="037039_0014_100C8ACA0CF00EB8">
wretch, who, for purposes unknown, was eager to bring this unfortunate young man to an untimely end.</P>
<P>Other &s;tories of a similar nature were diffu&s;ed, ten|ding to criminate the prisoner with the blacke&s;t character; and to have credited the account of popular rumor, we would have supposed his whole life had been one con|tinued ti&s;&s;ue of enormities.</P>
<P>This affair is thus brought to a conclusion, as far as it implicated the character of the pri&s;oner. He has been tried by a jury of his peers, the whole transaction has been minutely inve&s;tigated, and he is declared Guilt|le&s;s.</P>
<P>It only remains to warn our fellow-citizens of one too common error:&mdash;When a man has been &s;u&s;pected of an offence of this horrid nature, a degree of odium not to be removed, is apt to attach it&s;elf to his character.</P>
<P>The world cannot easily forget that he has been &s;u&s;|pected, and even an acquittal does not always convince them of his innocence. Yet the inju&s;tice of this proce|dure mu&s;t be evident, on a moment's reflection. How many guiltle&s;s per&s;ons may, by circum&s;tances, be ren|dered liable to &s;u&s;picion? Is it not then dreadful, if even innocence, publicly e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hall not be re&s;cued from the mo&s;t degrading puni&s;hment of guilt&mdash;the lo&s;s of public good opinion!</P>
<P><HI>We have attempted in this narrative, to give a ju&s;t account of the trial, and a faithful &s;tatement of the evidence, together with every circum&s;tance worthy of note, that fell under our ob&s;ervation. The carele&s;s and inelegant &s;tyle in which the&s;e are recited, we ac|count for on three principles, independent of deficiency in point of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ility:&mdash;The fir&s;t is, the exce&s;&s;ive fatigue we have undergone in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">tending this lengthy trial, which has deprived us of two nights <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t, and rendered us unfit for any occupation. The &s;econd is, the
<PB N="16" REF="037039_0015_100C8ACBF623B9D8">
extreme ha&s;te which we, though thus fatigued, are obliged to exert &mdash;writing and printing at the &s;ame time, that our competitors in this</HI> hi&s;torical <HI>employment, may not get the &s;tart of us. The third is, our entire indifference whether our readers are plea&s;ed with our &s;tyle or not. We are faithful in giving them the</HI> matter, <HI>and we care very little about the</HI> manner.</P>
<P>We now conclude with a&s;&s;uring our enlightened fel|low-citizens, of the full acquaintance we po&s;&s;e&s;s with their fondne&s;s for the marvellous. We well know the gratification they receive from the &s;tory of a gho&s;t, the hi&s;tory of a murder, or any other agreeable &s;ource of amusement. And they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that we will let &s;lip no opportunity of delighting them with plea|&s;ant recitals of this kind, provided they remunerate, our &s;ervices, by purchasing our publications with the nece&s;|&s;ary liberality.</P>
