<HEAD>THE WATCHMAN'^s ALARM, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Men, Brethren, and Fathers, and ye that fear <HI>GOD,</HI> give audience.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE peculiar &s;olemnities of this day are more immediately adapted, by the pub|lic con&s;ent of the churches, to paint forth the life and MEREDIAN of LIBERTY. The di&s;|tre&s;s you are in, and the danger there is of your lo&s;ing your rights, call aloud to &s;upplicate the throne of GOD for deliverance; to pray for a re|&s;toration of your ju&s;t rights, and a final &s;ettlement of the &s;ure enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>By liberty, is meant political liberty; and, ac|cording to the true etimology of the word, in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>'s dictionary, it is a power of acting agreable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the laws which are made and enacted by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;ent of the PEOPLE, and no ways incon|&s;i&s;tent with the natural rights of a &s;ingle per&s;on, or the good of &s;ociety. This is the liberty which is oppo&s;ed to &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Liberty of the mind is the free thought that expands, ruminates from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from ri|vers to the end of the earth, and none can con|troul it. The chariot of a thought, of a wi&s;h, of a de&s;ire, is like the wings of the morning, which flies to the <HI>uttemo&s;t parts of the earth</HI>; and is like the &s;un which rejoices to run its race; it is like the fountains which ri&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly free; it is like the emitting life of the vine to all its bran|ches; like the flowing rivers, the fertile fields in their plea&s;ant growth, or like the gentle zephyrs which diffu&s;es its fragrant life through the globe.
<PB N="6" REF="013757_0006_0F91EBF3987BB728">
This is freedom which is above the controul of man, or beyond the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of any parliament or mini&s;terial tyrant. This is that kingdom of liberty which no man can de&s;troy, and therefore not the liberty we are this day to treat of and &s;o|lemnize. That which calls upon every heart and commands every &s;oul, is that of a civil and &s;a|cred nature, which is &s;o much in danger.</P>
<P>Civil liberty is the people's inherent right to en|joy; namely, all the privileges of their laws ac|cording to their compact with their King; this right is ever inherent in the people, and cannot be given to kings, nor taken away by any parlia|ment what&s;oever; the enjoyment may, but the right cannot; its creation is natural and ri&s;es with every generation. This is the power of the peo|ple which <HI>binds kings in fetters and nobles in irons.</HI></P>
<P>Sacred liberty is a &s;atisfaction of &s;oul in the choice of wor&s;hip and adoration of GOD: This is JEHOVAH's law for the &s;ouls of men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> but devils and prie&s;tly tyrants have ever <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to invade this right.</P>
<P>But as your civil rights are de&s;troyed, your ca|pitol town be&s;ieged, your harbor blockaded, your port &s;hut, trade, which is the &s;inews of life and liberty is &s;topped by power and force of arms, what have we not to fear re&s;pecting our divine liberty? This makes it a night of di&s;tre&s;s and &s;orrow, of great darkne&s;s and many fears: This makes me mourn for the affliction of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>; to mourn with them that mourn, to hang my harp with the re&s;t of the captives and weep; yet not as tho&s;e who are without hope, <HI>for he that hath delivered doth deliver, in whom we tru&s;t he will yet deliver.</HI></P>
<P>But this night of &s;orrow naturally leads me to
<PB N="7" REF="013757_0007_0F91EBF4699CDCD0">
the words of the Prophet, for the pre&s;ent con|templation;</P>
<P><HI>Watchman what of the night? Watchman what of the night?</HI></P>
<P>What indeed! a very proper, a very important que&s;tion at this time. The mo&s;t remarkable tran&s;actions of the GOD of heaven for the deli|verance of his people are made manife&s;t as a key to unlock, or as a door to open the divine de|&s;igns by interrogations. Thus when man had &s;inned and marred the beauty of his creation; when that light, life, love, adoration, and con|templation of his GOD had for&s;aken his &s;oul, the GOD of heaven &s;aid unto him, Adam, <HI>Where art thou?</HI> Thus when a cloud of &s;orrows covered the camp of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and GOD &s;eemed to for&s;ake his people, <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> who&s;e name denotes the LORD's &s;alvation, &s;aid, <HI>If</HI> I&s;rael <HI>turn their backs upon their enemies, what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</HI> Thus <HI>Elihu,</HI> when he taught <HI>Job</HI> the cor|ruption of his heart and nature, and how unbe|coming it was in him in calling him&s;elf righ|teous, and ju&s;tifying him&s;elf under his affliction before GOD, &s;eeing his heart was corrupt, that it was not his thoughts, words, or actions that could acquit him before GOD, and therefore he &s;ays, <HI>How &s;hall a man be ju&s;t with</HI> GOD? How indeed! But this que&s;tion I leave for the Prie&s;ts to an&s;wer, who are very bu&s;y about it, but in general know nothing of the matter.</P>
<P>Another &s;olemn que&s;tion we have, which is, Who &s;hall go to heaven? I hope you would be glad to know this, my hearers; you will find it, P&s;. xxix.3. <HI>Who &s;hall a&s;cend unto the hill of the</HI> LORD? <HI>and who &s;hall &s;tand in his holy place? He that hath clean hand and a pure heart.</HI> Is it him?
<PB N="8" REF="013757_0008_0F91EBF529D60D70">
Then it is plain, my friends, that it is not you nor me, for our hearts are <HI>impure.</HI> Who can it be? A very proper que&s;tion. Were they the Prophets and Patriarchs? No! no! for they were like you and me, they had often unclean hands, and always a corrupt heart. Who can it be? That is the point. Are they our Mini|&s;ters, then? O no, my friends, no, no, that is a &s;ettled point; certain, both in heaven and in earth, for the &s;cripture &s;ays, <HI>We have all &s;inned, and are verily men, &s;ubject to like pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and therefore not pure in heart. Who can they be? I think I will leave it for the Prie&s;ts to tell you, whom I believe, if <HI>Paul</HI> was alive, would &s;oon tell them they know but very little of this matter; this I know they will not let me go, becau&s;e, they &s;ay, I have eat with unwa&s;hen hands: What then? Have not they or have not I wa&s;hed them &s;ince? Will not that do? If it will I think I have as good a right to go to heaven as they have. May not one crowd in with them? No, no, they will not give you elbow room. Well, they need not be afraid, for I will not go with them, nor tru&s;t my &s;oul among them. You may, if you plea&s;e, brethren, for I have no dominion over your faith, but would fain be a helper of your joy.</P>
<P>Again, when &s;in and &s;atan, when death and hell had invaded the rights of the whole creation and made it groan; when &s;inners were to be re|deemed, GOD glorified, &s;alvation fini&s;hed, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s revealed, life, liberty, and glory to be made manife&s;t to the &s;ons of men; an inquiry, according to &s;cripture ideas, &s;eems to ari&s;e from the &s;acred throne, <HI>Who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me, &s;aith the</HI> LORD? Who, indeed? The an&s;wer you have from CHRIST's
<PB N="9" REF="013757_0009_0F91EBF5E2A621E8">
own own lips, I&s;a. lxiii.5. <HI>And I looked and there was none to help, and I wondered that there was none to uphold; therefore mine own arm brought &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, when the church &s;aw, prophetically &s;aw, the great work fini&s;hed, namely, righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;hining like the light of the morning, &s;al|vation &s;ealed as the fini&s;hed work of the GOD of heaven, &s;in &s;uffered for, the law fulfilled, GOD glorified, death, hell, and the grave triumphed over. She &s;ays, <HI>Who is this?</HI> Who is this in|deed that has done all this? Few know among the Prie&s;ts, and fewer de&s;ire to know among the people: But it is <HI>I,</HI> &s;aith the Redeemer, <HI>that &s;peak in righteou&s;ne&s;s, mighty to &s;ave.</HI> This &s;hews what divine de&s;igns and grand di&s;plays of mercy are made manife&s;t by &s;cripture interrogations.</P>
<P>Which leads me to the contemplation words, or fir&s;t inquiry,</P>
<P><HI>Watchman what of the night? Watchman what of the night?</HI></P>
<P>I will tell you as well as I can, but be patient, for I am not eloquent, and my talent is &s;mall, and I am but a poor man and little e&s;teemed in <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> I have read of a poor wi&s;e man who by his wi&s;dom delivered the city, yet no man re|membered the &s;ame poor man: But never you mind that, for there is nothing new under the &s;un.</P>
<P><HI>What of the night?</HI> you a&s;k. I will tell you, it is a <HI>very good night</HI>; I mean for hone&s;t men to be out in, the &s;tars are clear, the &s;ky is &s;erene, the wind is calm: It is to be &s;ure a <HI>bad night</HI> for thieves and robbers, who intend to catch our per&s;ons, &s;teal our properties, and rob us of our rights, it is a very bad night for them. The &s;crip|ture &s;ays, <HI>If a thief comes, he comes in the night</HI>;
<PB N="10" REF="013757_0010_0F91EBF691EF6A58">
but he loves a dark night. But be not afraid, for the <HI>morning cometh</HI>; remember from a <HI>night</HI> aro&s;e all the ble&s;&s;ings of creation, the beauties of paradi&s;e, and all the happine&s;s of the life that now is, and the hope of that which is to come. As it is written, <HI>And darkne&s;s covered the face of the deep, and he &s;aid let there be light, and there was light</HI>; therefore fear not the night, <HI>though weeping may endure for a night, yet joy cometh in the morning.</HI></P>
<P>Yet &s;ometimes by <HI>night</HI> I own we are to un|der&s;tand <HI>deep troubles,</HI> national di&s;tre&s;s, and per|&s;onal &s;orrows, as was the ca&s;e of <HI>Jacob,</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> of the prophets, and the nations of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and of <HI>Judah</HI>; and it is worthy our attention for a mo|ment; did I &s;ay, nay but for eternity, to ob|&s;erve the ponderous &s;orrows of CHRIST's &s;oul, when he poured out his &s;oul to death, when he made his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, when his &s;oul was troubled, when being in an agony, and his &s;weat was as the drops of blood, when his &s;oul <HI>was &s;ore amazed,</HI> when dying the ju&s;t for the un|ju&s;t, to bring us nigh unto GOD. All the&s;e &s;or|rows in their ponderous weight and pre&s;&s;ing feel|ings are &s;et forth by the figure of a <HI>dark night</HI>; this, &s;ays CHRIST, <HI>is your hour and power of dark|ne&s;s: And there was darkne&s;s over the whole land until the ninth hour.</HI> Hence he &s;ays, <HI>My head is wet with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears that the word <HI>night</HI> denotes &s;orrows per&s;onally and nationally, and this is your ca&s;e, as well as that of the united colo|nies, &s;o far as they feel for and &s;ympathize with you.</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince your Forefathers, who were the Patriarchs and Apo&s;tles of <HI>America,</HI> though
<PB N="11" REF="013757_0011_0F91EBF758837B70">
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the &s;avage tribes, yet they enjoy|ed their political charter liberties &s;ettled by compact with their king.</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince the capital of <HI>America,</HI> the me|ridian harbor of the continent was open, your ca&s;tle commanded, your colors flying, your com|merce &s;preading, your importance growing, your laws ruling, peace and plenty flowing, your war|like &s;pirit &s;hining, your &s;tandards renowned: But ala&s;s! be a&s;toni&s;hed, O heavens at this, how has your loyalty almo&s;t proved your ruin; &s;ee|ing your power, beholding your importance; jealous, jealous of a growing empire, the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;try take the rein of government, break the compact of their King, a&s;&s;ume the right of making your laws, and u&s;urp the authority of taxing your property, tyrannically and oppre&s;&s;ive|ly to the whole globe, continue to block up your harbor, cruelly cutting through the &s;ilver veins of trade, &s;tained your &s;treets with the bloody dews of death; they have &s;eized your ca&s;tle, be&s;ieged your town with all the maje&s;tic horrors of war! But lo! they look to a peaceful, &s;erene people in the light of a few powerle&s;s, harmle&s;s doves, trembling upon the ground they tread; and only to unnece&s;&s;ary fearful minds terrible as an army with banners; this is their hour and power of darkne&s;s, but fear not, the <HI>morning cometh.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Watchman what</HI> do you hear <HI>of the night?</HI></P>
<P>I will tell you, as I <HI>&s;tand continually upon my watch tower in the day time, and &s;it whole nights in my watchward.</HI> I &s;aw a brother watchman coming near my watch-ward, he is an old faith|ful watchman, his name is <HI>Micah,</HI> to whom I &s;aid, having had a familiar acquaintance with him, <HI>Watchman what of the night?</HI> He did not
<PB N="12" REF="013757_0012_0F91EBF8192CB3C0">
&s;ay, as <HI>New-England</HI> people generally do, I do not know, Sir, and immediately begin to tell you; but he &s;ays, like an hone&s;t whig, I will tell you, if your heart be as my heart; you will find it in my journal,Sir, <HI>Micah</HI> vii.3. <HI>That they may do evil with both hands earne&s;tly, the Prince a&s;keth and the Judge a&s;keth for a reward; and the great Man uttereth his mi&s;chievous de&s;ire:</HI> SO THEY WRAP IT UP. Have they not done wrapping up yet? What will they wrap up next? The &s;eas, the morning light, the &s;un, the&s;e they have wrapped up long ago in <HI>England</HI>; nay the bea&s;ts of the forre&s;t and the fowls of the air, and the felicity of the fields and the ble&s;&s;ings of the earth, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the land tax, window tax, beer tax, tythes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> the rain from heaven; nay, the earth, air, and &s;ea is wrapped up by them; &s;o that there is nothing, O happy! but heaven left for us to make our e&s;cape from them. In &s;hort they are like death and the grave, which cries, GIVE, GIVE, but we have nothing to give them. Have they not wrapped up our harbor, our common, our ca&s;tle, our trade, our wharves, our &s;hips that we cannot launch them? What would they have? Have they not wrapped up a great part of the lands of <HI>America,</HI> called the <HI>King's lands and tall pines</HI>? Have they not wrap|ped up our charter rights, liberties, and con&s;ti|tutional privileges? Have they not wrapped &s;e|ven millions annually from <HI>America?</HI> What more would they have? Brother Watchman I I will tell you: They want to wrap up <HI>America</HI> into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> kingdom; they want to make three bi&s;hopricks in <HI>America,</HI> a Bi&s;hop for <HI>Bo&s;|ton, &amp;c.</HI> a Bi&s;hop for <HI>New-York, &amp;c.</HI> a Bi&s;hop for the <HI>Carolinas, &amp;c.</HI> all officers and offices to

be held in the power of the Crown, and at the di&s;po&s;e of the King, and &s;ixty more lord&s;hips by degrees, then peradventure (for they do &s;uch things in <HI>England</HI>) the next will be to wrap up our wives and our daughters. Stop, we will not have them wrapped up by them however; but I believe it is be&s;t to unwrap it all and &s;ee what is in this political bill of parcels.</P>
<P>Pray brother Watchman can you tell me who &s;ent for this parliamentary bill of parcels? O yes: Mr. <HI>T&mdash; H&mdash;n,</HI> Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> Mr. <HI>O&mdash;r,</HI> and others, by private and confidential letters. Well then, let them pay the bill and defrey the expences of it; What have we to do with it?

And is it not unju&s;t for tho&s;e who wrapped this bill to &s;end it to, and charge upon tho&s;e people who never ordered it? I think it can never &s;tand in equity.</P>
<P>But Watchman, as you are free and open, re|member your commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xxi.6. <HI>For thus hath the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;aid unto me, go and &s;et a Watchman, let him declare what he &s;eeth.</HI></P>

<P>Watchman you have told us what of the night: But Watchman what of the <HI>morning?</HI></P>
<P>I will tell you; the morning cometh, the morn|ing of hope, the morning of help, the morning of mercies. The morning cometh; that is hap|py, it cometh. How? without the aid of man, of its own accord, by infinite power. Thus our deliverance comes from the GOD of Heaven. Who among you would dare in a dark <HI>night</HI> to attempt to help omnipotence to &s;pread the wings of the <HI>morning</HI>? Would not the attempt in thought be bla&s;phemous; wait with patience, the morning cometh freely as the gift of hea|ven, and thus comes your deliverance, not only temporal but &s;piritual and eternal, as the fruit of omnipotent love and power. Hence CHRIST is &s;aid to be as the light of the <HI>morning, as the light of the morning without clouds.</HI> And this doc|trine is believed by all mankind, but the Prie&s;ts and the people. The Prie&s;t &s;ays, GOD will give &s;alvation as the light of the morning; he offers it to you, but you mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t the Almighty, and help him on your part, or you cannot have it, by fulfilling the conditions of the covenant;
<PB N="23" REF="013757_0023_0F91EC0056E89BD8">
by coming up to the terms of the go&s;pel, by getting faith, by laying down your arms of <HI>ho&s;tility, &amp;c.</HI> O! if they will but do the&s;e good things, in plain Engli&s;h help the Almighty a little, win him over by a few dead promi&s;es and prayers, and then he will give them the light of the morning, I mean his favor: Hence it is they tell the dead they mu&s;t live or they will be damned, <HI>that is all</HI>; the deaf they mu&s;t hear or they will peri&s;h; the blind they mu&s;t &s;ee or they will be lo&s;t. But &s;ays the dead in &s;in, I cannot give my&s;elf life, and the deaf, I cannot hear, and the blind I cannot &s;ee: But &s;ays the Preacher you will be damned if you do not; putting all the fir&s;t, living, and moving power upon tho&s;e who have neither life nor power, yet according to them they mu&s;t be damned be|cau&s;e they have it not: And this they call the light of the go&s;pel; poor Ignoramus's: I do not mean as Gentlemen or as Scholars, but re|&s;pecting the go&s;pel of CHRIST, my &s;oul of|ten melts for them with holy compa&s;&s;ion, at other times, like <HI>Elijah,</HI> in order to awaken them, I cannot but mock them with a holy in|dignation, <HI>Why halt they between two opinions?</HI> I do not mean all; there are &s;ome whom I de|light to hear. But O when will the Prie&s;t pro|claim, <HI>When &s;hall the people know the joyful &s;ound?</HI> namely, that &s;alvation from the GOD of Heaven is as free, as unconditionally free and powerful to the &s;ouls of men as the light of the morning is unto mankind.</P>
<P>Further, let it be remembered what natura|li&s;ts &s;ay, that it is darke&s;t ju&s;t before the <HI>morning light</HI>; this &s;cripture experience and ten thou|&s;and
<PB N="24" REF="013757_0024_0F91EC0118B85E80">
delivering mercies have made manife&s;t to the &s;ons of men; then why &s;hould we fear; remember what the Prophet &s;ays, <HI>In the even|ing it &s;hall be light,</HI> add as <HI>David</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Though weeping may endure for a night, yet joy cometh in the morning.</HI> You never knew a night but the morning followed it, nor a dark affliction ei|ther of &s;oul or body, but what a &s;ure mercy followed it, ju&s;t as the morning followeth the night; as it is written, <HI>The evening and the morn|ing were the fir&s;t day.</HI></P>
<P>As the night is the womb of the morning, &s;o is the night of affliction the womb of ten thou|&s;and times ten thou&s;and mercies to mankind; by this very idea, the glory of heaven, the joy of &s;aints, and the &s;alvation of &s;inners is declar|ed. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> cx.3. &s;peaking to the MESSIAH, JE|HOVAH &s;ays, <HI>From the womb of the morning thou ha&s;t the dew of thy youth.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover by the light of the morning we be|hold the beauties and ble&s;&s;ings of the day.&mdash; Thus it is by the light of the morning of mer|cies, to &s;peak in &s;cripture language <HI>When</HI> JEHO|VAH <HI>&s;catters the princes in</HI> Salmon, <HI>rebukes kings, and binds princes in fetters, and nobles in irons, to make known deliverance to</HI> Jacob, <HI>and &s;alvation to</HI> I&s;rael. This makes the mountains to rejoice, and the trees of the field to clap their hands, and the people to &s;ay amen. <HI>This is the</HI> LORD's <HI>and it is marvelous in our eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Once more: The morning cometh, the light of the morning is &s;ure to &s;catter the darkne&s;s of the night, it is omnipotent, and uncontroulable. Who can &s;top the expanding wings of the morn|ing? It is a beam of omnipotence; the morn|ing
<PB N="25" REF="013757_0025_0F91EC01D9C99000">
rays are the rays of the Deity. Wait on the LORD then and be of good courage for the <HI>morning cometh.</HI> Nor is it in the power of kings, princes, potentates, parliaments, or any arbitrary arm to &s;top the&s;e morning mercies; for as the morning &s;urely cha&s;es away the darkne&s;s of the night, &s;o the LORD JESUS, who is the light of the morning, &s;hall &s;ure|ly cha&s;e away every night of &s;orrow from them that fear him: <HI>Unto you that fear my name,</HI> &s;ays GOD, <HI>&s;hall the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;e with healings in his wings.</HI></P>
<P>One more inquiry: <HI>Watchman what of the night?</HI> Do you think we de&s;erve it? I know we de&s;erve it from GOD, but not from man; and I acknow|ledge that you de&s;erve it from GOD?

glo&s;s over their dete&s;table u&s;age with the idle <HI>pretence</HI> of chri&s;tianizing them, when it is well known more than one half tho&s;e who are owners of the&s;e black people do not care what becomes of the &s;ouls of them, if they can reap the profits ari&s;ing from the labor of their bodies, at lea&s;t until they arrive at the age of fifty, a period which is far beyond the meridian of man's natural life. I only judge from their conduct towards the&s;e mi&s;erable creatures, more e&s;pecially with regard to their education, and this a&s;&s;ertion is notoriou&s;ly verified in re&s;pect of tho&s;e who hold &s;laves in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> as well as in mo&s;t parts of <HI>America,</HI> even where the chri&s;tian religion is profe&s;&s;ed, they are not learned to read one word of the holy &s;crip|ture, or &s;ay their catechize: Nay, &s;ome venture to &s;ay, were they to have learning, and to be in|&s;tructed in the principles of religion, they would be of no &s;ervice to any one: However, admitting their motives of importing the&s;e <HI>Africans</HI> to make chri&s;tians of them, if they can, to be &s;incere, is it likely any man will be willing to bind him&s;elf for life, in order to obtain your chance &s;alvation, by means of your prayers, feelings, movings of the &s;pirit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which perhaps mo&s;t of you may ac|count works of righteou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P>This truly benevolent and public-&s;pirited way of freeing black men when they are old, reminds me of a &s;tory I heard of one who was held in bon|dage until he was near &s;ixty years of age, when his ma&s;ter very generou&s;ly offered him his freedom, after telling him he had been a faithful, hone&s;t &s;lave, and thanked him for his pa&s;t good &s;ervices.

<P>Blu&s;h ye pretended votaries for freedom! ye tri|fling patriots! who are making a vain parade of being the advocates for the liberties of mankind, who are thus making a mockery of your profe&s;&s;ion, by trampling on the &s;acred natural rights and pri|vileges of the <HI>Africans</HI>; for while you are fa&s;ting, praying, non-importing, non-exporting, remon|&s;trating, re&s;olving, and pleading for a re&s;toration of your charter rights, you at the &s;ame time are con|tinuing this lawle&s;s, cruel, inhuman, and abomina|ble practice of en&s;laving your fellow-creatures, which is &s;o di&s;graceful to human nature; a practice which mu&s;t redound to the eternal di&s;honor of any peo|ple much more to tho&s;e who <HI>wear</HI> the chri&s;tian name, and mu&s;t &s;urely make the heart of every feel|ing per&s;on &s;hudder at the thought of being held in perpetual &s;lavery, but &s;hocking to relate, it is re|alized by millions of unhappy mortals in the world, a greater part of which I am &s;orry to &s;ay are dwel|lers in this <HI>American</HI> land of freedom!</P>
<P>But if ye fail of aboli&s;hing this vile cu&s;tom of &s;lave-making, either by a law of the province, com|mon law, (which I am told has happily &s;ucceed|ed in many in&s;tances of late) or by a voluntary re|lea&s;ement, the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ons of <HI>Africa</HI> may very ju&s;tly retort this &s;tubborn pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred writ up|on you, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lviii.6. <HI>Loo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s, undo the heavy burdens, let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, that ye break every yoke</HI>: And may truly &s;ay with the &s;ame Prophet, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> i.13, 19. <HI>Bring no more vain oblation: The calling of a&s;&s;emblies I cannot away with; it is iniquity even the &s;olemn-meeting.

<P>But let me a&s;k you, I mean tho&s;e who are guilty in this re&s;pect, with what face can you look up to the ALMIGHTY, that ju&s;t and righteous Being, and beg of him his aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our po|litical affairs, while we are oppre&s;&s;ing our <HI>African</HI> brethren ten thou&s;and times as much by keeping them in &s;lavery for life? And what is a trifling three penny duty on tea in compari&s;on to the in|e&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of liberty to one captive? But O &s;hocking the very imagination! yet more amaz|ing the reality! to know we have millions among us who are &s;laves to all generations, at lea&s;t we de|&s;ign them as &s;uch, unle&s;s &s;ome kind arm &s;hould interpo&s;e in the behalf of the&s;e mi&s;erable people to put an end to their bondage. O how it makes me rejoice, yea it makes me leap for joy, when I mention the much honored names <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word of GOD commands us to give honor to whom honor is due, and &s;urely it is not due to any more than to tho&s;e who relieve the <HI>op|pre&s;&s;ed,</HI> and give <HI>liberty</HI> to them who are in <HI>bondage</HI>: We de&s;ire there|fore to mention five honorable Gentlemen, who have, from chri&s;tian principles and from a &s;incere love of <HI>liberty,</HI> given <HI>freedom</HI> to their &s;laves, namely, JOSEPH BOWDITCH, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Capt.

May they and their chil|dren be ble&s;&s;ed for this truly god-like act; and may their public-&s;pirited example be followed by
<PB N="29" REF="013757_0029_0F91EBDE8CA06C00">
many, very many Gentlemen who are owners of &s;laves. Let it never be told in the &s;treets of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> that nur&s;ery of freedom, that there is one bond-&s;lave dwells therein.</P>
<P>To conclude this &s;olemn and much di&s;cu&s;&s;ed &s;ubject, however little regard may have been paid to it by tho&s;e who&s;e intere&s;t it may ju&s;tly be &s;up|po&s;ed to be to &s;light every thing that &s;hall be advan|ced in favor of the <HI>Africans.</HI> However the time is coming, I hope, when in&s;tead of the&s;e &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and much oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>Africans</HI> retorting pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture on you &s;lave-makers, our Savior's words may come with full power and have their de&s;ired effect, namely, <HI>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them.</HI> Though little account may be made of them in the religious as well as political world, they ought to be the eternal rule of righteou&s;|ne&s;s to mankind.</P>
<P>Some of you may remember what your late Go|vernor <HI>Pownall</HI> &s;aid to his &s;ervant <HI>Frank,</HI> on his confining a number of birds in a cage: Says his Excellency, Who&s;e birds are tho&s;e in that cage? Mine, Sir, replied his &s;ervant. What did they co&s;t? Two dollars, Sir. Says his Excellency, there are your two dollars for them, let them be free, for I will have no being that GOD has made, in bondage in my hou&s;e. Soon after the Governor purcha&s;ed a number of flying-&s;quirrels to &s;end to <HI>England,</HI> which he confined in a cage: His man <HI>Frank</HI> &s;eeing them, enquired of his fellow-&s;ervants who&s;e &s;quirrels they were? They informed him they belonged to his Excellency; on which <HI>Frank</HI> immediately let them all free: And on his carrying the tidings to his Excellency, enquired of him, what the &s;quirrels co&s;t? The Governor was a lit|tle
<PB N="30" REF="013757_0030_0F91EBDF4DAF43F0">
angry at fir&s;t for his freedom in a&s;king what they co&s;t? but on telling him he had &s;et them at liberty, and offering to pay for them, his Excel|lency was much plea&s;ed with the familiar, &s;oft ad|monition in favor of liberty.</P>
<P>Sir, One word if you plea&s;e as Watchman.</P>
<P><HI>Watchman what of the night?</HI> I mean of the night of mini&s;terial darkne&s;s of the go&s;pel; what of the night, Watchman?</P>
<P>Who is he that makes this inquiry? Thou art &s;ure a &s;en&s;ible &s;oul, for I have not had &s;uch an en|quiry ever &s;ince I have been upon my watch tower in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>This enquiry, my hearers, will naturally lead me for a few minutes to &s;peak of religious liberty, and you that do not love religion or &s;acred liberty may go out, there will no body take any notice of it but GOD, and you know and others will know that you do not mind him much; but I chu&s;e to &s;peak a word in &s;ea&s;on to the enquirer, becau&s;e among &s;en&s;ible people it is known that the Stand|ing Mini&s;ters, in general, by their arbitrary au|thority in the churches and de&s;potic power by councils have as much de&s;troyed the charter rights of the church of CHRIST, as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;try have the rights of the <HI>American</HI> &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>However I will tell the enquirer it is a dark night indeed, in&s;omuch that the people in a &s;acred &s;en&s;e <HI>&s;eem to</HI> me <HI>to dwell in the land of darkne&s;s and of the &s;hades of death,</HI> but it is a very good night for blind <HI>folk,</HI> for blind Prie&s;ts and blind people, for <HI>the blind lead the blind,</HI> the night and the day are both alike to them; they group at noon-day and &s;tum|ble upon the dark mountains; for if the light that is in them be darkne&s;s, how great is that darkne&s;s; nor will they come to the light le&s;t their mini&s;te|rial
<PB N="31" REF="013757_0031_0F91EBE00D1AF330">
deeds &s;hould be reproved, and if any dawn of light appears to any, the Prie&s;ts with the in&s;en&s;i|bly fine thread of prejudice &s;ews their eyes, as man|kind &s;ew up the eyes of <HI>flutterers</HI> to blind them, that by them they may catch more pigeons, and thereby make them &s;even fold more the children of condemnation. The Prie&s;t goes his old, cold, deathly and phari&s;aical round (like a hor&s;e in a mill) of long prayers, tears, conditions, terms; do your part, lay down your arms, &s;ubmit and GOD will change his <HI>anger,</HI> will love you and have mercy upon you. Such phari&s;aical <HI>rubbi&s;h</HI> we have con|tinually from the pulpit: If you a&s;k bread they give you a &s;tone; if you talk to them in the lan|guage of <HI>Canaan,</HI> they an&s;wer you in the language of <HI>A&s;hdod</HI>; this makes it a dark night, a dark night to the church indeed. When do we ever &s;ee the mini&s;tration of glory made manife&s;t by the Prie&s;t, by preaching CHRIST as the light of the <HI>morning,</HI> or ever proclaim the light of a DIVINE RIGHTE|OUSNESS, of a fini&s;hed &s;alvation, of pardon alone by CHRIST's death, atonement by his blood, of vic|tory by his re&s;urrection, of peace only by the be|lief of the fini&s;hed righteou&s;ne&s;s and atonement. When do we hear of the power of the HOLY GHOST in regeneration, giving freely like the light of the morning, life, light, peace, joy, and con&s;olation by the mini&s;tration of the go&s;pel, and thereby engaging their &s;ouls by the bonds of al|mighty grace, to <HI>new obedience</HI> day by day. Some|times we have a little of the&s;e things mentioned, but depend upon it, in general, there is <HI>death in the pot,</HI> when ever the &s;ons of the Prophet &s;eeth it: They are always &s;etting forth GOD and the crea|ture at a di&s;tance from each other, like two <HI>angry parties,</HI> and then they per&s;uade the creature not to
<PB N="32" REF="013757_0032_0F91EBE0CD461DF8">
be angry any longer, and then GOD will not be angry with him, &s;o the people the be&s;t of them in general &s;o e&s;teemed, they think right to get a robe of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, being ignorant of GOD's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and then judge all is well with them, and are plea&s;ed, like children, with them&s;elves, vainly thinking that GOD is plea&s;ed with them, becau&s;e the Prie&s;t tells them &s;o: <HI>And &s;o they wrap it up</HI>: And if any one attempts to unwrap it and &s;ays as CHRIST did, <HI>How can ye e&s;cape the damna|tion of hell?</HI> they are like the &s;cribes and phari|&s;ees, exceeding angry to be &s;ure, and &s;ay why <HI>he is a troubler in</HI> I&s;rael, he is be&s;ide him&s;elf, he has not the approbation of the Standing Mini&s;try. How|ever I am of Mr. <HI>C&mdash;&s;&mdash;ll</HI>'s mind who, was de&s;ir|ed to procure the <HI>approbation</HI> of the Standing Mi|ni&s;try, that he might be more exten&s;ively u&s;eful in the world. He replied, by no means, for he had had their <HI>reprobation</HI> for twenty years, which he thought far more preferrable.</P>
<P>But though your &s;orrows may yet continue, your harps hang upon the willows, and things may yet grow darker and darker, and your &s;or|rows be like the &s;wellings of <HI>Jordan,</HI> yet fear not, the morning cometh. <HI>Though the fig-tree &s;hould not blo&s;&s;om, nor there &s;hould be no fruit on the vine; the labor of the olive fail, and the field yield no meat, and the flocks be cut from the field, and there &s;hall be no herd in the &s;talls; yet wait on the</HI> LORD <HI>and be of good courage, the</HI> morning cometh. Support your congre&s;s, maintain your union, &s;trengthen your affection, relieve the poor, per&s;evere in piety, pa|tience, and prudence as a band of brethren united in one COMMON CAUSE, be fearle&s;s, be harmle&s;s, and may GOD ALMIGHTY ble&s;s you.</P>
