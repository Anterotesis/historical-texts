<HEAD>Remarks, <HI>&amp;</HI>c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a fact not controverted by any, that the oppo&s;ition, made by this town and province to a <HI>Briti&s;h act of parliament,</HI> laying a duty upon the importation of tea in any of the <HI>American colonies,</HI> hath involved us in great mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s; and that we are threatened with much greater calamities, the horrors of which are beyond de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>parliament</HI> have or have not a con&s;ti|tutional power to impo&s;e this duty, I &s;hall not pretend to determine; but this I may venture to &s;ay, and I hope without giving offence; that the <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> that hath been generally made to it, is incon&s;i&s;tent with our profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>chri&s;tianity,</HI> with the <HI>loyalty</HI> we owe to our SOVEREIGN, and the reverence and re&s;pect that is due to the <HI>Briti&s;h parliament</HI>; and con&s;equently, in&s;tead of being a means to obtain a repeal of the ACTS, will in all probability being on us a heavier condemnation than that of the <HI>port-bill,</HI> or the ACT for the alteration of our <HI>con&s;titution.</HI> All that is propo&s;ed by the following pages is to give an impartial repre&s;entation of the de&s;truction of the <HI>tea</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and to make a few remarks upon the proceedings of the continental and provincial <HI>congre&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>In the month of December 1773, a number of per&s;ons in di&s;gui&s;e collected from Bo&s;ton and the neighbouring towns, not having the fear of GOD be|fore their eyes, or the good of their country at heart unlawfully a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together, and in a riotous, tumultuous manner de&s;troyed a great quanti|ty of tea, belonging to the <HI>honorable Ea&s;t-India com|pany</HI>&mdash; An action of &s;uch a gro&s;s immoral nature
<PB N="4" REF="014074_0003_0F92DB8EE652DE08">
as cannot be ju&s;tified upon the principles of equity or policy: An <HI>action</HI> which laid the foundation for the mi&s;eries and calamities we are now groaning under: An <HI>action</HI> of &s;uch a malignant atrocious nature, as mu&s;t expo&s;e the wicked perpetrators of it, without &s;incere repentance, to the vengeance of that BEING, who is a GOD of order and not of confu&s;ion, and who will puni&s;h all THIEVES as well as liars in the lake which burns with fire and brim&s;tone.</P>
<P>This <HI>diabolical action</HI> it is true, was di&s;claimed by the &s;ober thinking part of the <HI>town,</HI> but no &s;teps were taken either by the <HI>town</HI> or <HI>government,</HI> to &s;how their di&s;like of it; on the contrary, many among&s;t us, who would be thought to be <HI>religious,</HI> in which cla&s;s were &s;ome of the <HI>clergy,</HI> endeavoured to palliate the crime, as they &s;aid it prevented a wor&s;e evil, not duly con&s;idering that <HI>chri&s;tianity</HI> forbids our doing <HI>moral evil</HI> though ever &s;o much <HI>good</HI> &s;hould come from it.</P>
<P><HI>The parliament of Great-Britain,</HI> highly incen&s;ed again&s;t the <HI>town,</HI> for &s;uch an <HI>outrageous</HI> action, thought proper to puni&s;h us by pa&s;&s;ing an <HI>act</HI> called the <HI>port bill.</HI> By which <HI>act</HI> it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged that the innocent &s;uffer as much, if not more than the guilty, which is often the ca&s;e in <HI>national puni&s;hments</HI> and cannot well be avoided. However, as &s;evere as this act may be accounted by &s;ome, the &s;everity of it would have been in a great mea|&s;ure le&s;&s;ened, if the <HI>town</HI> had done their duty up|on the news we had or the bill's having the <HI>royal &s;anction,</HI> by paying the money to the order of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India company</HI>; and had they complied with the other parts of the <HI>act,</HI> which <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and good <HI>policy</HI> required them to do, the <HI>port</HI> would not

have been &s;hut up above four months, the damages then would have been incon&s;iderable to what we now &s;uffer by our refu&s;ing to comply with the requi&s;itions of <HI>&s;aid act</HI>; the charitable donations from the <HI>other governments,</HI> being very &s;hort of a conpen&s;ation for what we &s;uffer by the lo&s;s of our <HI>trade.</HI>&mdash;But to do ju&s;tice to the &s;ober thinking part of the <HI>town,</HI> upon the certain news of the port bill's being carried into an <HI>act,</HI> they thought it to be our intere&s;t and duty immediately to pay for the <HI>tea</HI>; accordingly a <HI>town</HI> meeting was called to con&s;ult what was proper to be done upon this alarming occa&s;ion: And it &s;eemed to be the &s;en&s;e of mo&s;t who were then pre&s;ent, that out of <HI>policy</HI> at lea&s;t, we ought to comply with the requi&s;itions of the <HI>act,</HI> but many difficulties were &s;tarted as to the manner of doing it; &s;ome propo&s;ed the voting of the money directly; this was objected to, as being illegal, the <HI>town</HI> not having any authority by <HI>law</HI> to rai&s;e monies for that purpo&s;e without the &s;pecial aid of the <HI>general court,</HI> but as they were to &s;et in a few weeks, it was motioned that a petition &s;hould be preferred to them to enable the <HI>town</HI> to borrow the money upon the credit of a future tax; others thought that the <HI>province</HI> ought to pay the money, or at lea&s;t to let them have the loan of it for a num|ber of years without intere&s;t, and that a <HI>committee</HI> &s;hould be rai&s;ed to apply to them for that purpo&s;e: But others, who&s;e <HI>importance</HI> and <HI>political &s;alvation</HI> depend upon the <HI>province</HI> being kept in a continual flame, and ob&s;erving that the general &s;en&s;e of the <HI>town</HI> was in favour of paying for the <HI>tea,</HI> though they did not chu&s;e openly to oppo&s;e &s;uch a <HI>righteous mea&s;ure,</HI> yet artfully threw difficulties in the way of the different methods that were propo&s;ed: They
<PB N="6" REF="014074_0005_0F92DB911B7EB628">
did not pretend to deny the ju&s;tice and equity of paying for it, but ob&s;erved that this <HI>act</HI> might affect all the <HI>colonies</HI>; and that as in all probability there would &s;oon be a <HI>continental congre&s;s</HI>; it would be our wi&s;dom to do nothing until we had the united &s;en&s;e of the <HI>colonies</HI>; and that they did not doubt they would recommend the payment for the tea, and each <HI>colony</HI> would willingly advance their proportion of it; whereas, if we &s;hould immediately order the payment they may po&s;&s;ibly re&s;ent it, and con&s;true it as our &s;ubmitting to the <HI>act of parlia|ment</HI> impo&s;ing the duty upon that article, and &s;o the <HI>union</HI> and <HI>harmony</HI> which at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the <HI>colonies</HI> would be in great danger of being de&s;troyed.&mdash;In the mean time it was propo&s;ed that we &s;hould repre&s;ent to the &s;everal <HI>colonies</HI> our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition, praying them for relief for our &s;uffering brethren, who were out of employ by rea&s;on of the <HI>port bill.</HI> The&s;e rea&s;ons though altogether de&s;titute of &s;incerity, &s;eemed to be very plau&s;ible, and they accordingly had their effect: And the <HI>town</HI> did nothing further concerning it.</P>
<P>The <HI>general court</HI> met upon the la&s;t wedne&s;day in May, and were adjourned to Salem the tue&s;day following, but as no application was made to them, they took no <HI>order</HI> relative to it: And as nothing was done by the <HI>general court,</HI> nor likely to be done by the <HI>town,</HI> in order to open the <HI>port,</HI> the worthy trade&s;men began to be very unea&s;y, and thought it proper, that they, who were like to be &s;uch great &s;ufferers, &s;hould have a meeting by them|&s;elves, and con&s;ult what was proper to be done to prevent their <HI>ruin</HI>; they accordingly a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Faneuil-hall</HI> to the number of two or three hundred, and many if not mo&s;t of them went with a
<PB N="7" REF="014074_0006_0F92DB91C996E138">
re&s;olution to u&s;e their endeavors that the tea &s;hould be paid for; but &s;o artful and indu&s;trious were the <HI>principal heads</HI> of the oppo&s;ition to <HI>government,</HI> that they placed them&s;elves at the doors of the <HI>hall</HI> and told the trade&s;men as they entered, that now was the time to &s;ave our <HI>country.</HI>&mdash;That if they gave their voice in favor of paying for the tea, we &s;hould be undone, and the chains of <HI>&s;lavery</HI> would be rivitted upon us! which &s;o terrified many hone&s;t well meaning per&s;ons, that they thought it not prudent to act at all in the affair, and &s;o nothing was concluded upon.</P>
<P>The next day the <HI>committee of corre&s;pondence</HI> di&s;per&s;ed among the people a mo&s;t <HI>wicked, diabolical</HI> hand bill called a <HI>league and covenant,</HI> which was &s;ent to every <HI>town</HI> and <HI>di&s;trict</HI> in the PROVINCE, calling upon the inhabitants to &s;ign it, which paper was introduced in many <HI>towns</HI> by the <HI>mini&s;ter</HI> of the pari&s;h, who &s;et them the example of &s;igning fir&s;t, and then called upon his pari&s;hioners to engage in the &s;ame <HI>covenant,</HI> and to &s;ign it upon the com|munion table, and it is reported that a certain <HI>cler|gyman</HI> in the <HI>county</HI> of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> gravely told his people, that they who refu&s;ed to &s;ign it were not worthy to come to that <HI>table.</HI>&mdash;I do not pretend to &s;ay po&s;itively that this is a fact, though it is ge|nerally believed: But be that as it may, it is certain that many of the <HI>di&s;&s;enting clergy</HI> have &s;o far pro&s;|tituted their <HI>&s;acred office,</HI> as to be leaders and en|couragers of the people to &s;ign this wicked covenant, whereby they have led many of their people to commit the <HI>horrible crime of perjury</HI>; for not one of many hundred of tho&s;e who have &s;igned it, have paid any regard to it, and what makes it more &s;urpri&s;ing that they &s;hould have exerted them|&s;elves
<PB N="8" REF="014074_0007_0F92DB93599028B0">
upon that occa&s;ion is, that not one in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> where this <HI>covenant</HI> was fabricated has &s;igned it; and con&s;equently every countryman who has, and has any dealings with the <HI>Bo&s;tonians</HI> mu&s;t infallibly perjure him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We have now done with the <HI>&s;olemn league</HI> and <HI>covenant,</HI> and &s;hall proceed to the con|&s;iderations of the proceedings of the <HI>continental Congre&s;s.</HI> In the month of September they a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> with all the pomp and grandeur of Plenipotentiaries; when the expectations of the peo|ple in general were, that by their wi&s;e and prudent councils, re&s;pectful and dutiful petitions to his MAJESTY and to his <HI>parliament,</HI> a door would be open for the <HI>&s;upreme legi&s;lature of Great-Britain,</HI> con&s;i&s;tent with the honor and dignity of that <HI>augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly,</HI> to have our grievances redre&s;&s;ed, and that the fir&s;t &s;tep that would have been taken for that purpo&s;e, would have been to have advi&s;ed the <HI>town</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to pay for the <HI>tea.</HI> But ala&s;s how have we been di&s;appointed! Tho&s;e per&s;ons who have been the occa&s;ion of our political troubles in this <HI>province,</HI> were members of this <HI>continental body,</HI> and having already become <HI>de&s;perate</HI> them&s;elves had no other card to play, but to involve the whole <HI>continent</HI> in their <HI>rebellion.</HI>&mdash;No doubt vainly ima|gining, that although a &s;ingle <HI>town</HI> or <HI>province</HI> may be reduced by the power of GREAT-BRITAIN; they would not venture an attack again&s;t the whole <HI>continent.</HI>&mdash;The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts delegates &s;o far &s;uc|ceeded in their plan, that the fir&s;t thing the <HI>congre&s;s</HI> did that was made public, was the adopting of the re&s;olutions of the county of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> which were not &s;hort of high <HI>trea&s;on</HI> and <HI>rebellion,</HI> nothing healing or &s;alutary could then be expected from &s;uch a <HI>con|gre&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="014074_0008_0F92DB9562945B20">
the only apology that could be made for their conduct was, that they came into this vote imme|diately after drinking thirty two bumpers of the <HI>be&s;t madeira,</HI> and it &s;eems the next morning when their heads were cool, they were a&s;hamed of what they had done; but it was then too late for a recon&s;idera|tion of the vote, a copy of it atte&s;ted by the <HI>pre&s;i|dent,</HI> having been forwarded to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> by our wor|thy citizen <HI>Paul Revere,</HI> who was di&s;patched from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> as a <HI>courier</HI> with the <HI>Suffolk re&s;olves</HI>; how|ever, to avoid making any &s;uch mi&s;takes for the fu|ture, they prudently determined to do no bu&s;ine&s;s after dinner.</P>
<P>Their whole proceedings as they are made pub|lic, no doubt are in the hands of every gentleman who hath any ta&s;te for <HI>political controver&s;y</HI>; though by the way, they cautiou&s;ly omitted in&s;erting this extraordinary vote in the pamphlet they publi&s;hed, entitled, "Extracts from the votes and proceedings of the American continental congre&s;s."</P>
<P>As &s;everal gentlemen at <HI>New-York,</HI> have made very &s;en&s;ible remarks upon their proceedings, and have proved to demon&s;tration if their a&s;&s;ociation be &s;trictly adhered to, we mu&s;t be involved in one com|mon ruin: For trade and commerce is the &s;upport of the <HI>farmer</HI> as well as the <HI>merchant</HI> and <HI>&s;hopkeep|er</HI>; and the foundation of learning; without which, in proce&s;s of time, there will be no true rational <HI>religion</HI> among&s;t us; and as their writings are di&s;per|&s;ed through the <HI>province,</HI> it is needle&s;s for me fully and particularly to animadvert upon them: How|ever, it may not be ami&s;s to make a few cur&s;ory remarks upon their conduct, which, whether perti|nent or not, is humbly &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014074_0009_0F92DB95C75676B8">And here it is worthy of notice, they have redu|ced the number of tho&s;e that were concerned in the de&s;truction of the <HI>tea,</HI> to thirty or forty, when it is very evident that TWO THOUSAND at lea&s;t, were employed either directly in de&s;troying the <HI>tea,</HI> or in keeping a centry at the entrance of the wharf where the &s;hips lay, and at tho&s;e wharves contigu|ous thereto: They then exclaim again&s;t the &s;everi|ty of the <HI>port bill,</HI> in puni&s;hing <HI>thirty thou&s;and,</HI> as they &s;ay, for the offence of a few individuals. It is po&s;&s;ible that mo&s;t of the <HI>congre&s;s</HI> might not have been acquainted with the truth of the fact, and de|pending upon the veracity of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts de|legates,</HI> put full faith and confidence in their repre|&s;entations; be that as it may, it is manife&s;t that tho&s;e members who went from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> knew bet|ter; they certainly gave their voice in favor of a <HI>no|torious fal&s;hood,</HI> knowing it to be &s;uch. What apology then can be made for gentlemen of their EXALTED CHARACTER, that for the &s;ake of carry|ing a point, could be guilty of &s;uch a crime, that every one who is not entirely lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of ho|nor would be a&s;hamed of? Po&s;&s;ibly the&s;e <HI>ca&s;ui&s;tical</HI> and <HI>patriotic,</HI> not to &s;ay <HI>je&s;uitical</HI> gentlemen, to ea&s;e their con&s;ciences, may think it no harm to <HI>lie</HI> for the good of their <HI>country</HI>; and as it is &s;aid they have often enthu&s;ia&s;tically declared, they would wil|lingly &s;acrifice their lives and fortunes in defence of their civil rights and liberties; and as they have lit|tle or no property to lo&s;e, in order to tran&s;mit their names with honor to po&s;terity, they are willing to part with their <HI>&s;ouls</HI> in lieu of it; but to adopt the language of <HI>in&s;piration</HI> with a very little variance, "What will it profit a man tho' he recovers all his civil rights and privileges, if he lo&s;es his own &s;oul?"</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="014074_0010_0F92DB971C8FEF78">We &s;hall now proceed to make a few &s;trictures upon the tenth article of their a&s;&s;ociation, which runs thus,
<Q>In ca&s;e any merchant or trader, or other per|&s;on, &s;hall import any goods or merchandize after the fir&s;t day of December, and before the fir&s;t day of February next, the &s;ame ought forthwith at the election of the owner, to be either re&s;hip|ped or delivered up to the committee of the county or town wherein they &s;hall be imported, to be &s;tored at the ri&s;k of the importer, until the non|importation agreement &s;hall cea&s;e; or be &s;old un|der the direction of the committe afore&s;aid; and in the la&s;t mentioned ca&s;e, the owner, or owners of &s;uch goods, &s;hall be reimbur&s;ed (out of the &s;ales) the fir&s;t co&s;t and charges; the profit, if any, be to be applied towards relieving and employing &s;uch poor inhabitants of the town of Bo&s;ton, as are immediate &s;ufferers by the Bo&s;ton port bill; and a particular account of all goods &s;o returned, &s;tored or &s;old, to be in&s;erted in the public papers: And if any goods or merchandize, &s;hall be import|ed after the &s;aid fir&s;t day of February, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> ought forthwith to be &s;ent back, without break|ing any of the packages thereof.</Q>
This a&s;&s;ocia|tion was agreed upon the 20th of October, 1774.</P>
<P>Although there is nothing compul&s;ive in this ar|ticle, yet being compared with &s;ome other of their articles and re&s;olves, it is manife&s;t they de&s;igned it &s;hould have the operation of <HI>law</HI>; and it hath ac|cordingly had that effect in regard to &s;everal ve&s;&s;els that have arrived at Salem and Plymouth, &s;ince the fir&s;t day of December, the owners of which cargoes, have had their goods piratically taken from them and expo&s;ed to public &s;ale, agreable to the foremen|tioned article.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides, the&s;e poor inhabitants among whom this <HI>charity</HI> is di&s;tributed, are not all of them nece&s;&s;arily &s;ufferers by the <HI>port-bill</HI>: Many of them might have been employed by the army in their re&s;pective occupations, whereby they would have accumulated more wealth than they could po&s;&s;ibly have earned, if that <HI>act</HI> called the <HI>Bo&s;ton port-bill</HI> had never been pa&s;&s;ed, but they were prevented by the <HI>troublers</HI> of <HI>our I&s;rael,</HI> left a &s;top &s;hould be put to the charita|ble donations from the neighbouring <HI>colonies.</HI>&mdash; Now the real unavoidable &s;ufferers by this act are the merchants and traders, and con&s;equently they are the per&s;ons who have an equitable claim at lea&s;t to a part of the donations; but in&s;tead of con&s;ider|ing them in that light, the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of the <HI>congre&s;s</HI> hath laid a tax upon them, to &s;upport &s;ome of tho&s;e who by their indu&s;try in their &s;everal callings may get as comfortable a &s;upport, as if this act had never pa&s;&s;ed.

is the crime of a <HI>highwayman,</HI> who robs the rich traveller of a few guineas, to be compared with this for it's iniquity? By no means; the latter is not &s;o great an offender as the former; for in one ca&s;e the gentleman only lo&s;es a few guineas (as it may be) he can very well &s;pare; but in the other, many a <HI>family</HI> may be deprived of the means of &s;upport, and in time be reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of <HI>poverty.</HI> The <HI>congre&s;s</HI> not content with this <HI>wicked re&s;olve</HI> have <HI>impiou&s;ly</HI> recommended it to the <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> who, by their &s;acred office, are not only to preach the <HI>doctrine</HI> of <HI>grace</HI> but to inculcate the duties of morality, in which a due &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to government is included; I &s;ay, have ad|vi&s;ed them by their circular letters, to u&s;e their en|deavors, that their tyrannical and wicked directions be put in execution.
