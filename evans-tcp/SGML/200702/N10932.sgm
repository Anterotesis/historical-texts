Fortune had mo&s;t unju&s;tly be&s;towed upon others in too large a pro|portion.</P>
<P>It was a matter of di&s;pute for &s;ome time whether they were of the <HI>Mohawk</HI> kind or not; and this &s;u&s;picion, I imagine, fir&s;t aro&s;e from the ob&s;ervation of a learned phy&s;ionomi&s;t, who perceiving their <HI>Os frontis</HI> to be uncommonly flat, bur&s;t out into the following exclamation:</P>
<L>"Your &s;ap&s;culls are neither &s;quare, oval, nor round,</L>
<L>"A proof that their judgments can never be &s;ound:</L>
<L>"I really believe they are put <HI>wrong way on,</HI></L>
<L>"As they &s;eem to re&s;emble a cobler's lap-&s;tone."</L>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the above a&s;&s;ertion might border upon truth, yet &s;everal of the&s;e chiefs denied it, by openly declaring them&s;elves to be neither more nor le&s;s than plain <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI>; who &s;corn'd to &s;calp any per&s;on who would &s;ubmit to have his private property de&s;troyed, without complaining.</P>
<P>With regard to their <HI>political</HI> &s;chemes, I challenge all <HI>Hell</HI> to match them. Law they have none, nor any do they want; and could they &s;end to Salem or Endor to procure a <HI>witch</HI> to bring MOLLINEAUX from the dead, even HE would condemn them.</P>

mouths of millions in America. But it is prophe&s;ied that the time is near at hand, when the <HI>frothy food</HI> will fail them.</P>
<P>But generous JOHN &s;corns to let him &s;tarve,&mdash;far from it; 'tis well known his pur&s;e-&s;trings have been at SAM's di&s;po&s;al ever &s;ince he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making the Oration delivered by JOHN on the 5th March 1774, to a crowded audience of Narragan&s;et <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The Second of the&s;e chiefs is H&mdash;CK, who having been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of too much money for a private gentleman, re&s;olved to make a public attempt to become a Monarch, and having courted <HI>popularity and power</HI> almo&s;t as long as he did Mi&s;s ...... Mi&s;s ...... or Mr Barnard's cook-maid, Betty Price, is at la&s;t likely to be jilt|ed in his turn, and in the end to be wedded to beggary, contempt, and a g&mdash;s.</P>
<P>The Third of the&s;e incomparable <HI>Indians</HI> is ROWE; a chief (according to George Alexander Stevens) po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a great fund of kn&mdash;owledge; but having a &s;kull of an uncommon thickne&s;s, and the futures of the <HI>cranium</HI> being clo&s;ely compacted, he never has never been able to di&s;play any rational faculties, except when he invented the new method of <HI>making Tea.</HI></P>
<P>But, oh! for words to grace the character of the mo&s;t traiterous of men!&mdash;a modern Bravo. Did not the name of <HI>rebel</HI> &s;tain the <HI>&s;oldier,</HI> I could have afforded him a more brilliant title, and have call'd him a General. His name is L&mdash;. Oh! beware my friends of his follies! He mounted to almo&s;t the height of preferment but mazed with ambition, he fell from the precipice, bur&s;t him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;under, and expo&s;ing his pride, proved <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
