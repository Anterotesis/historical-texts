<HEAD>The Ju&s;tice and Policy of Taxing the American Colonies in Great-Britain, con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER the Commons of England made up a part of the Saxon Witting|ham Mote, hath been a &s;ubject of great di&s;pute; and altho' this point has ne|ver been fully determined, yet it &s;eems to be agreed by the authority of two learned writers,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Spellman and Maddox.</NOTE> that they were always called to attend it, whenever the <HI>exigencies</HI> of the &s;tate made a tax <HI>nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> with|out doubt, to make known their circum&s;tances, and to &s;ugge&s;t to that a&s;&s;embly &s;ome mode of taxa|tion that was likely to be the lea&s;t burthen&s;ome to them. This ju&s;t and laudable practice prevailed 'til the time of William the Conqueror, when that prince erected a new court or parliament, of which the commons were no part, and changed the Allo|dial tenure of the Saxons into the Feudal, and annexed certain rents or &s;ervices to all his grants, from which, together with fines and forfeitures, the crown was abundantly &s;upplied; it therefore &s;eldom happened that any were taxed in this court; but when it did, they were tallaged to one tenth part of their e&s;tate only, and none but villeins were ever liable to be taxed at will.</P>
<P>This method of tallaging tho&s;e who were &s;ub|ject to it, continued but for a few reigns after the conque&s;t, and then a regular parliament was e&s;|tabli&s;hed, which con&s;i&s;ted of the Superior and in|ferior Barons, Citizens and Burge&s;&s;es, who it is &s;aid,<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ld. Coke.</NOTE> at fir&s;t &s;at together: But when they had
<PB N="4" REF="010076_0003_0F7C93CB803924E8">
formed them&s;elves into di&s;tinct hou&s;es, the re|pre&s;entatives of the people laid claim to their an|tient and equitable right of taxing them&s;elves and con&s;tituents, and have ever &s;ince, with the great|e&s;t propriety and ju&s;tice, enjoyed it.</P>
<P>From this &s;light view of the mode of impo&s;ing taxes for public benefit, &s;o long practi&s;ed in Great-Britain, (in the cour&s;e of which there has been no other interruption, than that occa&s;ioned by the conque&s;t) it is clearly to be inferred, that the right of pre&s;cribing the mea&s;ure and man|ner of rai&s;ing all taxes is a con&s;titutional one, which was enjoyed by the ance&s;tors of the Colo|ni&s;ts; and the pre&s;ent inhabitants of Great-Bri|tain, as early as they have any knowledge of them from hi&s;tory, and has been handed down to them under the influence of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, through a cour&s;e of &s;everal hundred years.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more con&s;i&s;tent with the rights and liberties of a free people, than whenever the good of the community requires a part of the private property of Individuals, that they &s;hould be allowed to give it in &s;uch manner and propor|tions as their &s;ituation and circum&s;tances can be&s;t afford; indeed they cannot be free without it: for if any &s;ublunary power in being, can deprive them of part of their e&s;tate without their con|&s;ent, the &s;ame power may take away the whole; and if it appears to them to be a mea&s;ure of ju&s;|tice, pro&s;cribe 'em into the bargain.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Colonies upon the Con|tinent (other than tho&s;e acquired in the late war) have always thought, and I believe ever will think, all the con&s;titutional rights and liberties en|joyed
<PB N="5" REF="010076_0004_0F7C93CC65EECCD8">
in Great-Britain, at the time they departed from it, their Birth-Right, and that they brought them over with them to America; among which, that of being taxed only by their own con&s;ent, is one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>It is certainly very natural, that tho&s;e who tran&s;port them&s;elves from one country to ano|ther, &s;hould as well carry with them the Laws and Policy, as the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the country from whence they came. But it hath been &s;aid from the authority of a very learned Judge,<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Holt. Smith's ca&s;e.</NOTE> that the Colonies are conquered coun|tries; and that therefore the law is what the King plea&s;es: but however learned and re&s;pect|able the per&s;on might be who gave that opinion, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to declare that I think the &s;ub|ject was not well con&s;idered, and that it was founded on no Law whatever. Puffendorff, in &s;peaking of the different forms of government, takes occa&s;ion of mentioning two methods of treating the inhabitants of conquered countries: one is, when the victor removes 'em to his own country, or gives them the &s;ame privileges with his former &s;ubjects; the other is, when they are left to enjoy their antient &s;eats, but entirely lo&s;e the &s;overeignty of the country. In this la&s;t ca&s;e, he &s;ays, they are &s;ubject to the conqueror; but is the circum&s;tance of any of the Colonies, other than tho&s;e already excepted, &s;imilar to either of the&s;e ca&s;es? They &s;urely are not. The antient inhabitants of the Colonies have neither been re|moved to Great-Britain, or left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands; nor did they ever &s;ubmit to, or ac|knowledge
<PB N="6" REF="010076_0005_0F7C93CD1AA6B160">
them&s;elves &s;ubject to any foreign power upon earth, but have long &s;ince abandon|ed the country, and retired into remote parts of America, where they are governed by their own laws and their own magi&s;trates. It therefore can|not be &s;aid with the lea&s;t propriety, that the laws which the&s;e Savages alone, had they &s;taid in the country, would have been liable to, as a van|qui&s;hed people, are applicable to the pre&s;ent in|habitants of the Colonies, who them&s;elves, are the conquerors. The earth, the air and trees, are by no means the object of any human laws what&s;oever, otherwi&s;e than as they bear re&s;pect to the concernments of men. It mu&s;t then be the conquered people, who are &s;ubject to the laws of the conqueror, and not the country.&mdash;The Coloni&s;ts &s;eem to &s;tand on the &s;ame footing with tho&s;e who leave their own country, and &s;ettle them|&s;elves in a new one which was not inhabited be|fore: If they do, and I think it mu&s;t appear &s;o to any man who will give him&s;elf the trouble of con&s;idering this &s;ubject, then there is the opinion of the &s;ame learned Judge<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Holt. Blankard's ca&s;e.</NOTE> in favour of what I have advanced; which is that, the Coloni&s;ts have brought over with them every con&s;titutional right, liberty and privilege; and if being taxed only by their own con&s;ent is one of them, they cannot, with the lea&s;t degree of ju&s;tice, be taxed by the Briti&s;h parliament, in which they are not repre&s;ented, no per&s;on in that a&s;&s;embly being au|thorized to &s;ignify their con&s;ent: Few per&s;ons there, are acquainted with their circum&s;tance, and perhaps none know what mode of taxation would be lea&s;t burthen&s;ome to them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010076_0006_0F7C93D129AE3638">
It hath indeed plea&s;ed &s;ome of the honourable members of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly to &s;ay, that the Colonies are virtually repre&s;ented in parliament; but this is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> doctrine which only tends to al|low the Coloni&s;ts a &s;hadow of that <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> which they mu&s;t ever be &s;laves without. It can|not &s;urely be con&s;i&s;tent with Briti&s;h liberty, that any &s;et of men &s;hould repre&s;ent another, detached from them in &s;ituation and intere&s;t, without the privity and con&s;ent of the repre&s;ented. The of|fice of a repre&s;entative is founded on choice, and is intended for the benefit of the con&s;tituents: A repre&s;entative is to act in every re&s;pect as the per&s;ons who appointed him to that office would do, were they them&s;elves pre&s;ent: And hath the members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, or any of them, been cho&s;e by the Coloni&s;ts to repre&s;ent them? Hath their conduct in re&s;pect to the Stamp Duty been con&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;ts of the Coloni&s;ts? or hath that conduct been &s;uch as the the Coloni&s;ts would have adopted, had they been pre&s;ent in parliament? No &s;urely: So far from it, there are very few members of that a&s;|&s;embly, who have ever been heard of in Ame|rica. The Stamp Duty is incon&s;i&s;tent with their intere&s;ts, and the mode of impo&s;ing it, de&s;truc|tive of their mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights and liberties. It is very fortunate for the pre&s;ent members of parliament, that for all that can be done in the Colonies, they have an e&s;tate for life in their office; for I believe I may venture to &s;ay, that no Coloni&s;t in his &s;en&s;es, would ever de&s;ire to be again repre&s;ented by the &s;ame people.</P>
<P>To prove that the Coloni&s;ts are within the
<PB N="8" REF="010076_0007_0F7C93D20B52D1A8">
meaning of the doctrine of virtual repre&s;entation, they have been compared to the inhabitants of &s;everal corporate towns in England, to the Ea&s;t-India company, the body of London merchants, to the proprietors of the public funds, to women and children, and in &s;hort, to all tho&s;e who do not vote for the electing of members of parlia|ment, who are all &s;aid to be virtually repre&s;ent|ed: On the ju&s;tice and truth of this compari&s;on intirely depends the deci&s;ion of this que&s;tion. It may therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that by the antient Engli&s;h con&s;titution, none were ac|tually repre&s;ented in parliament, other than Shires, the Cinque-Ports, Cities, and Antient Boroughs, and the elections for them were made by freeholders, and tho&s;e who held by free bur|gage tenure; all villeins, copyholders, tenants in antient deme&s;ne, and tenants of lords, were excluded from electing or being elected: but at late&s;t, in King John's time, a practice obtained of making free boroughs by charter, by which means they became intitled to &s;end members to parliament, and it continued till the reign of King Charles the Second, when the Hou&s;e of Commons voted the elections made by virtue of that King's charters void, and &s;o put a &s;top to the practice. From hence it is evident that the right that tho&s;e derive from their particular &s;pecies of property, peculiar franchi&s;es, and in|habitancy in particular places, is not an exclu&s;ive one, becau&s;e it either depends on that which may, through the bounty of the crown, be extended, at lea&s;t to its American &s;ubjects, or on a certain &s;pecies of property that may be bought and &s;old,
<PB N="9" REF="010076_0008_0F7C93D2402E66E8">
and which the Coloni&s;ts are capable of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in any part of the King's dominions. If the right of being actually repre&s;ented in parliament, is con&s;titutionally annexed to freehold e&s;tate, the American freeholders can with no more ju&s;tice be deprived of it&punc; than they may of their free|holds. And the power of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them of either, cannot, from the nature of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, (which is formed on the foundation of &s;ecuring to every individual his right, liberty and property) be lodged with any other per&s;ons in being, than them&s;elves: The acknowledging them to have a right of being taxed only by their own con&s;ent, is yielding them that from which they never can derive the lea&s;t advantage, while ever that of actually choo&s;ing their own repre|&s;entatives, is withheld from them.</P>
<P>The notion of virtual repre&s;entation, may, for all I know, be con&s;i&s;tent enough, while it is con|fined to Great-Britain only; its inhabitants inti|mately re&s;ide together; the intere&s;t and circum|&s;tance of tho&s;e who do not vote for repre&s;enta|tives, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e that do; and are equally well known to, and under&s;tood by &s;uch repre&s;entatives. It cannot then be imagined, that the virtually repre&s;ented in Great Britain, can ever be &s;ubject to any impo&s;ition, that will not be extended to, and equally affecting to the electors of members of parliament: And tho' certain corporate towns, the Ea&s;t-India company, the body of London merchants, proprietors of public funds, the monied intere&s;t, and women, are not re&s;pectively as &s;uch, actually repre&s;ented in parliament; yet many of the members of them (women excepted) are intitled to vote for repre|&s;entatives;
<PB N="10" REF="010076_0009_0F7C93D2FB03C5D8">
and if they were not, the influence they, and particularly women (through who&s;e means votes are often obtain'd) mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have, from their intimate acquaintance and con|nection with the electors, is &s;uch as mu&s;t render the choice in a great mea&s;ure agreeable to them. But hath the Colonies any of the&s;e advantages? They certainly have not: They live above a thou&s;and leagues from Great-Britain; their inte|re&s;t and circum&s;tance are not &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h inhabitants; nor have they been well con|&s;idered or under&s;tood by the Briti&s;h parliament. The Coloni&s;ts have &s;uffered many impo&s;itions, as may be &s;een by the &s;everal acts of trade which have been borne by them alone, and which no other|wi&s;e affected the electors of members of parlia|ment, than as they were obliged to receive the pro|fit ari&s;ing from them. The Coloni&s;ts cannot have the lea&s;t influence either with the electors or elect|ed, they are almo&s;t unknown to either of them, unle&s;s as mere vehicles of trade; in which light in|deed they have been long known and con&s;idered.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who have been for bringing the Colo|nies within the meaning of virtual repre&s;entation, by comparing them to certain corporate towns and per&s;ons in England, had been plea&s;ed to mention why tho&s;e places and people are virtually repre&s;ented in parliament, they mu&s;t at the &s;ame time have proved that there is no &s;imilitude be|tween them and the Colonies; for all the&s;e pla|ces lay, and body of men re&s;ide in, &s;ome county or other of Great-Britain; and tho' nine tenths of the inhabitants of any county &s;hould not be intitled to vote at an election, yet are they a part of that county, and as &s;uch, may be virtu|ally
<PB N="11" REF="010076_0010_0F7C93D3B891B468">
repre&s;ented by tho&s;e who have been elected to repre&s;ent the whole county: But here the vir|tually repre&s;ented know their repre&s;entatives, and may, indi&s;criminately with the freeholders, at any time, in&s;truct them what part to act in ca&s;es of importance: But I &s;hould be glad to be informed, in what county in England the Co|lonies are &s;ituated? If in no one at all; who are their particular virtual repre&s;entatives? To &s;ay that they are repre&s;ented by the whole body of the Hou&s;e of Commons, will be to leave them without that advantage of giving their repre|&s;entatives occa&s;ional in&s;tructions, which the vir|tually repre&s;ented in England have; for it can|not be imagined, that the conduct of the Hou&s;e of Commons can ever be &s;ubject to the direction of the Coloni&s;ts. The &s;ame rea&s;on then why certain per&s;ons in England (who have been ex|cluded from voting at elections, merely for con|veniency) may be virtually repre&s;ented in parlia|ment, doth not hold good in re&s;pect of the Co|lonies; I therefore conclude that they cannot be repre&s;ented in the &s;ame manner: But if it &s;hould be &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon, that they are, I would then humbly propo&s;e, that the Colonies be divided into five hundred and fifty-eight di&s;tricts, and that each of them be numbered; that for the future, all writs of election in England, &s;hall direct the voters to chu&s;e a per&s;on to &s;it and vote in parliament as real repre&s;entative of the coun|ty, city, or borough, for which &s;uch writ &s;hall be i&s;&s;ued; and as virtual repre&s;entative of the five hundred and fifty-eighth part of the Colo|nies of &s;uch a number; and that each di&s;trict be made acquainted with its particular virtual re|pre&s;entative.
<PB N="12" REF="010076_0011_0F7C93D4F771D130">
By this means the Coloni&s;ts will know, to whom they are to direct their in&s;truc|tions; and will &s;o far be upon a footing with the virtually repre&s;ented in Great-Britain. That the notion of the Coloni&s;ts being virtually repre|&s;ented in parliament, is of late date, is evident from the numberle&s;s acts of oppre&s;&s;ion and ty|ranny that have been practi&s;ed upon them by officers of the crown commi&s;&s;ioned in England, and &s;ent over to America, which have been re|peatedly made known, and complained of in England; and whenever it hath happened that they were conveyed to the Royal Ear in Council, it hath con&s;tantly been thro' the chan|nel of the Board of Trade: But in no one in|&s;tance, that I know of, did ever the Briti&s;h par|liament repre&s;ent to the crown any grievances felt only in the Colonies, or make application to the Sovereign for a redre&s;s of them, and as a grand inque&s;t for the whole kingdom, (had they thought them&s;elves the repre&s;entatives of the Co|lonies) they would never have negligently pa&s;&s;|ed over a duty which was indi&s;pen&s;ibly incum|bent upon them. And that the Briti&s;h parlia|ment doth take cognizance of &s;uch &s;ubjects, when they happen in Great-Britain, is undeniably true; and would it not be want of humanity, to &s;up|po&s;e that they have always con&s;idered them&s;elves as the repre&s;entatives of the Colonies, and yet have ever neglected to render them an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, to which all tho&s;e they repre&s;ent, are in|di&s;putably intitled. To the inhabitants of the Colonies I have been &s;peaking of, the crown has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to grant re&s;pectively the means of exerci&s;ing their con&s;titutional rights,
<PB N="13" REF="010076_0012_0F7C93D58B3B1B58">
I have now before me a Charter given by King Charles the Second to the province of Carolina, and ob&s;erve, one of the principal objects of this Charter, was to encourage the &s;ettlement of that colony, in which few re&s;ided at the time it was granted; nor was it then likely that many would leave their native country, wherein they enjoyed every right and liberty an excellent con&s;titution could afford, and come over to the de&s;arts of America, unle&s;s by &s;ome means or other, an en|joyment of tho&s;e rights and liberties in Carolina, could be &s;ecured to them and their po&s;terity: One of the&s;e was, to be taxed only by their own con&s;ent, &s;ignified in parliament by repre&s;enta|tives actually cho&s;en by them&s;elves; and as the remote &s;ituation of Carolina from Great-Britain, rendered it impo&s;ible for tho&s;e who &s;hould inha|bit that province, to run over to England when|ever a new parliament was to be &s;ummoned.&mdash;King Charles thought proper to grant, that an a&s;&s;embly &s;hould be called and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the proprietors, and that the freemen of Carolina, &s;hould con&s;ent, by them&s;elves, or deputies in that a&s;&s;embly, to all laws what&s;oever, that might re&s;pect the public &s;tate of the whole pro|vince or territory, or of any di&s;tinct or particu|lar county. And had the crown con&s;idered the Coloni&s;ts as being virtually repre&s;ented in parlia|ment, &s;uch a grant would have been extreamly ab&s;urd; for no &s;et of people can be repre&s;ented at one time in two di&s;tinct and independent a&s;|&s;emblies, which may counteract each other: This might be to make the repre&s;ented grant and refu&s;e in one in&s;tant the &s;ame thing, which is impo&s;&s;ible, from the nature of the human
<PB N="14" REF="010076_0013_0F7C93D617414AF8">
mind. That it is a matter intirely new in Eng|land, further appears, from the con&s;tant and re|peated applications that have been made by the Crown in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t war, to the a&s;|&s;emblies in the Colonies, for &s;upplies; which, if the Briti&s;h parliament could have given, might as ea&s;ily have been a&s;ked for in England; and in all probability, would have been much more liberally granted; but the parliament had not then imagined them&s;elves the repre&s;entatives of the Coloni&s;ts; if they had, would they not have interpo&s;ed and a&s;&s;erted their right of taxing their con&s;tituents? more e&s;pecially, as the poverty of the Coloni&s;ts often obliged them to grant much le&s;s than the Crown required, and the bur|then became proportionably heavier in Great-Britain, as it was lighter in America; would they not have acquainted the King that they were the Colony repre&s;entatives, and that the Coloni&s;ts might be much more copiou&s;ly taxed in parlia|ment, than it was likely they wou'd choo&s;e to be, if their con&s;ent was to be a&s;ked in their own pro|vincial a&s;&s;emblies? Without doubt they would; but the truth is, the notion of their being virtu|ally repre&s;ented, had not then an exi&s;tence, but hath been &s;ince introduced, to cover the &s;hackles which have been prepared for the Coloni&s;ts in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of inability, by tho&s;e, who be|ing wholly attentive to them&s;elves, forget that the Coloni&s;ts are their fellow-&s;ubjects; that they were born free, and are intitled to every Briti&s;h con&s;titutional right and liberty, as well as them&s;elves; or that to do them inju&s;tice, is as criminal, as to deal unju&s;tly with tho&s;e they really re|pre&s;ent. To impo&s;e a Tax on the Colonies, in the Briti&s;h parliament, appears to me, to be a mea&s;ure almo&s;t as impo|litic, as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the rights of the Coloni&s;ts;
<PB N="15" REF="010076_0014_0F7C93D6B6D8C580">
for as they are unalterably of opinion, that &s;uch an impo&s;i|tion is no le&s;s arbitrary than oppre&s;&s;ive, it will by degrees alienate their affections from the Mother Country; the &s;eeds of di&s;content will be &s;owed in the Colonies, and children will be taught to hate the name of tho&s;e who have en&s;laved their country; the principles of di&s;affection will increa&s;e with their years, and the &s;pirit of rebellion grow formidable with their numbers; and in the cour&s;e of a century or two, it will co&s;t Great-Britain more to keep them in their &s;tate of &s;ubjection, than all the profits ari&s;ing from them, will pay: And if it did not, the &s;tory of Julius Cae&s;ar, is enough to &s;hew that there is danger in a &s;tanding army abroad.</P>
<P>The Stamp Duty is it&s;elf a burthen too great for the circum|&s;tances of the Colonies to bear, con&s;idering the many re&s;tricti|ons that have been put upon their trade, which are at pre&s;ent rigorou&s;ly enforced throughout America: It will occa&s;ion a di&s;continuance of indu&s;try, and mu&s;t in the end, reduce them to a &s;tate of beggary; they will no longer be able to pur|cha&s;e the manufactures of the Mother Country, or furni&s;h her with materials for making new ones. Great Britain then lo&s;es a trade, from which &s;he hath derived her greate&s;t opulence and dignity, and this too by in&s;i&s;ting on a mea|&s;ure de&s;tructive of the peace and happine&s;s of many thou|&s;ands of as loyal &s;ubjects as any the King has. Can this be con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom and humanity of a Briti&s;h parlia|ment? I think it cannot. The act impo&s;ing a Stamp Duty, will &s;urely be repealed, as &s;oon its con&s;equences are well con&s;idered. I am per&s;uaded, the more clo&s;ely united the Mother Country and the Colonies are, the happier it will be for both; but &s;uch an union will never take effect, but upon a foundation of equality: They mu&s;t be upon &s;uch a footing, as that each may advance the other's intere&s;t, while he labours for his own. A very &s;en&s;ible and elegant writer<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">CATO's Letters.</NOTE> in &s;peaking of Colonies, hath ob&s;erved that, <Q>It is not to be hoped, in the corrupt &s;tate of human nature, that any naton will be &s;ubject to another, any longer than it finds its own account in it, and cannot help it&s;elf. Every man's fir&s;t thought will be for him&s;elf and his own inte|re&s;t; and he will not be long to &s;eek for arguments to ju&s;tify his being &s;o, when he knows how to attain what he propo&s;es. Men will think it hard to work, toil, and run hazards, for the advantage of others, any longer than they find their own intere&s;t in it; and e&s;pecially for tho&s;e

who u&s;e them ill: All nature points out that cour&s;e. No creature &s;ucks the teats of their dams, longer than they can draw milk from thence, or can provide them&s;elves with better food; nor will any country continue their &s;ubjection to another, only becau&s;e their great grand-mo|thers were acquainted. This is the cour&s;e of human af|fairs; and all wi&s;e &s;tates will always have it before their eyes. They will well con&s;ider, therefore, how to pre&s;erve the advantages ari&s;ing from Colonies, and avoid the evil. And I conceive that there can be but two ways in nature to hinder them from throwing off their dependence; one to keep it out of their power, and the other out of their will. The fir&s;t mu&s;t be by force, and the latter by u&s;ing them well, and keeping them employed in &s;uch produc|tions, and making &s;uch manufactures as will &s;upport them|&s;elves and families comfortably, and procure them wealth too; or at lea&s;t, not prejudice their Mother Country.&mdash;Force can never be u&s;ed effectually to an&s;wer the end, without de&s;troying the Colonies them&s;elves. Liberty and Encouragement are nece&s;&s;ary to carry people thither; and violence will hinder both, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;I do not pretend to be politician enough to point out the methods that will mo&s;t effectually &s;ecure the dependency of the Colonies; but I am as much convinced, that ju&s;t and equitable ones may be di&s;|covered and pur&s;ued, as I am, that force and oppre&s;&s;ion will one day or other, produce a contrary effect. It would be no inju&s;tice that the Colonies &s;hould bear a proportionable part of the heavy expence that hath been incurred in the cour&s;e of the late war; and I am per&s;uaded, that no man of &s;en&s;e in the Colonies would opp&s;e it; but they &s;hould be allowed to con&s;ent to it, according to their con&s;titutional right, in their own provincial a&s;&s;emblies, where they are really repre&s;ented: And in e&s;timating &s;uch proportion of ex|pence, their number, circum&s;tance, and the re&s;trictions on their trade, &s;hould be con&s;idered: But if the Briti&s;h parlia|ment will in&s;i&s;t on taxing the Coloni&s;ts, as their virtual re|pre&s;entatives, then are they &s;tripped of that con&s;titutional right on which their liberty and property depends, and re|duced to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of &s;lavery: A &s;ituation, in which, it is very unnatural to think, a Mother can take plea&s;ure in viewing her Children.</P>
