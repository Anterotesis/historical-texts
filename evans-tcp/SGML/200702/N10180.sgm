<HEAD>An AUTHENTIC and PARTICULAR AC|COUNT of the LIFE of FRAN|CIS BURDETT PERSO|NEL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I FRANCIS BURDETT PERSONEL, was born in Ireland, tenderly rai&s;ed by careful and indu&s;trious parents, who took all care imagin|able of me in my education. Tho' eight years &s;chooling were laid out upon me, I did not improve it, &s;o as to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of my parents, they find|ing that I had not &s;o much learning as they expected I might have had in that time, bound me an apprentice, according to my own de&s;ire, to a good trade: When ma&s;ter of my trade I went to England; but on my voyage thither, put into Wales, went from thence to Bri&s;tol, in England, tarried there &s;ome time, and went from thence to Shepton-Mallet, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, where I al&s;o abode a con&s;iderable while, and was re|garded by all who knew me for my &s;ober deportment. My mother hearing where I was, continually impor|tuned me, by letters, to come home; which I accord|ingly did. My father being now dead, I began to be very careful about worldly affairs, and was remarkably &s;ober; yet, my mother being a pa&s;&s;ionate woman, could never be content with me; do what I could, I might have done it better. She often &s;aid to others, that being an only child, &s;he loved me beyond mea|&s;ure; yet it grieved me that &s;he was of &s;uch a tomper. I now became acquainted with a young man, who knew her temper, and de&s;ired me to go with him to a frolic; which I accordingly did: He e&s;pied a
<PB N="4" REF="012936_0003_0F903F430CB6AB50">
young woman walking along, whom he knew; he &s;pake to her, and de&s;ired her to go with us to take a gla&s;s of liquor, which &s;he did, and was in company with us, till it was &s;o late, that I dreaded to go home. She was the fir&s;t lewd woman I was ever in company with: But &s;in and Satan &s;trove &s;o much with me, that I left my mother's hou&s;e to be at liberty. While from under her eye, I was guilty of plea&s;ing the &s;inful ap|petites of the fle&s;h many times; &s;he hearing of me, ne|ver re&s;ted, till &s;he got me home again. I then lived with her &s;ix or eight months; but &s;oon growing weary of her continual admonitions, was re&s;olved to get out of her reach: Accordingly, came to Ameri|ca, where I &s;taid eighteen months; I then returned to Ireland, was very much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed when I got home, and was re&s;olved never to leave home again. I came to my mother in a poor and mi&s;erable condition; but &s;he received me tenderly, and kept me concealed, le&s;t the neighbours &s;hould &s;ee me before &s;he had provided cloathing for me. I then lived with her one year very comfortably; but, &s;he fearing that I would leave her again, advi&s;ed me to marry: I was glad of this propo&s;al, and &s;aid, if &s;he was willing, I would &s;eek me a wife as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; &s;he an&s;wered, &s;he had one already provided, of an hone&s;t family, who had &s;even &s;i&s;ters already married to creditable men, and that none of the family ever had the lea&s;t blemi&s;h in their characters; &s;he &s;aid, that the one &s;he had provided for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, was the younge&s;t, and I might get a hand&s;ome dowry with her: I a&s;ked her name; when I heard who &s;he was, I &s;aid I mu&s;t have &s;ome time to think of it, (not that ever I de&s;igned to have her) but was un|willing to put my mother in a pa&s;&s;ion: She &s;aid, I might have time to make love to her, but have her I mu&s;t, or never be a penny the better at her death. Thinking the young woman not hand&s;ome enough, nor &s;in eying her in the lea&s;t, knowing my&s;elf to be but young, I re&s;olved not to have her, let what would <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> My mother was at me day after day to
<PB N="5" REF="012936_0004_0F903F43DF9B85B0">
have her, but to no purpo&s;e. Being rid of this im|portunity by the young woman's being married to another; through di&s;obedience I came off to Ameri|ca a &s;econd time, and have never &s;ince returned. I lived in Baltimore county, in Maryland, for eighteen months, as a &s;ervant, and &s;erved but &s;o much of four years due for my pa&s;&s;age. Being now in want of clothes, as tho&s;e I brought from home were wore out, and tho&s;e I had of my ma&s;ter but indifferent, though far better than what other &s;ervants got for common. At length, I took a thought to run away, and accordingly did in a fooli&s;h manner; one morn|ing, after breakfa&s;t, my ma&s;ter came home, and &s;hew|ed me what was to be done; I worked a little after his departure, then took my ax with me, went about a mile through the woods, and &s;eated my&s;elf on the top of a hill till night, it being then the &s;pring of the year, though the trees were not yet green. I tra|velled that night but &s;lowly, my &s;hoes being bad and the roads very deep, as it had rained. I got within a mile of Baltimore by day-light, and then, for fear of being di&s;covered, went and laid me down in the woods; but, having only a &s;hirt, jacket, and a pair of trow&s;ers upon me, and it raining very much, I could not &s;leep, being cold, wet and hungry. I now repented of my running away, and would have returned home, had I not recollected that I had heard my ma&s;ter &s;ay, he would treat a runaway that returned, wor&s;e than one that u&s;ed his endeavour to get off; therefore, I would not go home, nor tell that I was a runaway, but wi&s;h|ed to be taken up; and, with an expectation of being taken, came on the high road at mid-day, and went into Baltimore Town. As nobody que&s;tioned me, I enquired for a certain tavern, where I had heard my ma&s;ter &s;ay he u&s;ed to put up at; coming there, I mentioned my ma&s;ter's name, and &s;aid, that he de&s;ir|ed me to get a dinner there; the landlord a&s;ked me if my ma&s;ter had given me a note. I &s;aid, no: Then &s;aid he, I cannot let you have dinner. I wi&s;hed to
<PB N="6" REF="012936_0005_0F903F448207C680">
be taken up, yet would not inform him I was a run|away.</P>
<P>I then walked through the town, and came to a road that leads to Annapolis, I reached the river by &s;un-&s;et, where I waited till two Gentlemen came who wanted to get over; they a&s;ked me to whom I belong? I &s;aid to Squire Carroll of Annopolis, which was fal&s;e; but he living in Annapolis, and I wanting to get there if po&s;&s;ible: They examined me no farther, knowing that whom I called my ma&s;ter had &s;everal farms, and his &s;ervants continually going from one to another: I travelled with this lie in my mouth till I came to Annapolis; it was evening when I came to town, and I had neither money, friends, nor clothes, I walked about hoping &s;omebody would take me up, but nobody noticed me. Going to a Gen|tleman's hou&s;e, I laid me down under the &s;toop, hop|ing that &s;ome one from within would examine me, but there came none. The next morning I walked out of town very feeble and hungry not having eat for a long time. I then wandered I know not where, &s;teering partly by the &s;un, travelled by day on the high road, caring not much whether I was then taken up or no, but was re&s;olved to keep going whil&s;t I was able. I met &s;everal people, and &s;aluted them, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed on: At length, I &s;aw a Gentleman on hor&s;eback coming towards me, which daunted me, fearing he was in pur&s;uit of me, I &s;aluted him, pa&s;&s;ed on, and &s;ometime after met his brother, who que&s;|tioned me: I told him I was ju&s;t free, and my ma&s;|ter was &s;uch a villain, that he would not give me my freedom dues, and that I came to Annapolis, in &s;earch of a friend, to acquaint him how my ma&s;ter &s;erved me. But unhappily, I told him, my friend had left town before I came, and having no money I left town, with an intent to get work in the country; he replied his brother wanted a workman but could get none this while pa&s;t, therefore, de&s;ired me to call at his brother's hou&s;e, told me his name, and gave
<PB N="7" REF="012936_0006_0F903F46F93C09E0">
proper directions, and de&s;ired me to tarry there till his brother came home, where I went, and &s;poke to the Gentlewoman, who ordered me a dinner, which was very welcome to me ju&s;t then: When the Gen|tleman came home, I engaged with him for four months under the name of James Alkins, having been with him a week or two, plea&s;ing him, being handy at any &s;ort of plantation work, he let me have nece&s;&s;ary apparel; with him I lived till after harve&s;t, but he not letting me have my earnings, le&s;t I &s;hould leave him before my time was expired, and I fearing my ma&s;ter would hear of me, borrowed a coat, hat, and other nece&s;&s;aries &s;uitable, under a pretence of vi&s;iting a friend, and went off, being provided with a pa&s;s I had written my&s;elf, and &s;igned a Magi&s;trate's name to it, changing my name to Patt Percy; having now &s;ome money, I delayed not till I got into Vir|ginia; and, being well dre&s;&s;ed, could write a pa&s;&s;ible hand, and under&s;tood &s;ome figures, I &s;et up for a Schoolma&s;ter, accordingly I got a &s;chool, where I taught for &s;ome time, was very well regarded by my neighbours, &s;ome gave me credit for one thing and &s;ome for another. I lived very happy, as I thought, ju&s;t then, and could go out on a evening after &s;chool and &s;erve the devil with delight. I continued this practice for &s;ome time, till I went to hear the Bapti&s;ts called by &s;ome New Lights. I went more out of curio|&s;ity then any thing el&s;e, having heard much of them: The fir&s;t &s;ermon I heard pricked my heart. I went to hear them often, wre&s;tled again&s;t &s;in in a mea&s;ure, and would not commit &s;uch as appeared ba&s;e in the world, and as few others as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I had a de&s;ire to leave off all fin; but depended on the broken &s;taff of my own &s;trength, therefore could not do it: I obtained the name of being a re|ligious young man by &s;ome, who knew not what it was; and I my&s;elf was deceived, thinking I was con|verted when only convicted, and wanted to join the church, but was not accepted, upon which the young
<PB N="8" REF="012936_0007_0F903F480CE19B80">
men derided me: yet I continued to hear preaeching, and, to appearance, had I &s;taid there, &s;hould have been brought to the knowledge of God through Chri&s;t: But two men, who &s;u&s;pected me to be a run|away, &s;aying they would take me up, occa&s;ioned my leaving this place, being unwilling to return to Ma|ryland to my ma&s;ter. I went to a widow, whom I was bound in oath to be married unto, borrowed a mare, bridle and &s;addle of her, under a pretence to go to town for &s;ome things; from whence I went, calling my&s;elf Francis Per&s;onel, <HI>alias</HI> Burdett Per&s;onel, and never returned. About an hundred miles there|from I &s;old the mare, bridle and &s;addle, and travelled to Pitt&s;burg, nigh which I tarried &s;ometime.</P>
<P>Thus you may &s;ee I have been a hypocrite, and what &s;in have I not committed, except the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t? And, I may thank God for re&s;training me by his grace from that, for my heart was bad enough.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For &s;ome tran&s;actions prior to this time, not in his MS. &s;ee a note, marked (<HI>a</HI>) at the end.</NOTE> After I came to New-York, I took a wife; and notwith&s;tanding I knew &s;he had followed a loo&s;e way of life, I loved her. In &s;hort the next morning af|ter I had been married and beded to her, I con&s;ent|ed to her going to her old habitation, till &s;he could pay &s;ome debts which &s;he &s;aid &s;he owed, and for which otherwi&s;e I would be &s;ued, but &s;he could pay them very &s;oon: She was not long there before I took her away, as I could not bear to think of her follow|ing that cour&s;e any longer. I did not let her want whil&s;t I was able to work, and could get it to do; but, unfortunately, I had not been long married before I was taken &s;o ill, as to be unable to work; and, as we &s;aw no other way, rather than be beholden to the peo|ple we lived with, we concluded unanimou&s;ly, that we mu&s;t either pari&s;h, or &s;he take to her old cour&s;e; ac|cordingly, &s;he pro&s;tituted her body as u&s;ual. The fir&s;t night &s;he went on this occa&s;ion, &s;he returned &s;omewhat
<PB N="9" REF="012936_0008_0F903F4855635F50">
cheerful, and &s;aid &s;he had met with a young woman that lent her &s;ome money, and declared &s;he had no conver&s;ation with any man that night. I an&s;wered, it was no matter if &s;he had, I would never tell her of it. Next night &s;he went and brought home &s;ome ca&s;h, which &s;he &s;aid was lent her in like manner. Sometime after I was ill, &s;he went out every night &s;he could, to which I &s;till encouraged her, even &s;o much as to go with her &s;ome nights part of the way, and would pa&s;s the evening at &s;ome neighbour's hou&s;e till nine or ten o'clock, then meet her at the place ap|pointed, and come home, as though we had been to|gether all the time we were out. This abominable practice we followed until the 16th of May, when I went to her father's, not expecting to return that night, neither did &s;he expect me, according to her own confe&s;&s;ion, otherwi&s;e &s;he would not have &s;taid out &s;o late. Upon my coming home that night, I &s;at down contentedly, knowing what &s;he was after. I waited for her till after nine o'clook, and &s;he not re|turning, I propo&s;ed to go to bed; and my landlady &s;aid &s;he would lock the doors. As I was unwilling &s;he &s;hould he &s;hut out all night, I &s;aid to my landlady, if &s;he would &s;it up fifteen minutes, I would go and &s;ee if I could find her; but if I did not return in that &s;pace &s;he might &s;hut the doors and go to bed. I went in que&s;t of her, and came to the hou&s;e where &s;he was, and notwith&s;tanding that &s;he was there, as I learnt by hearing her laugh, &s;he was denied to be there; and, as I was going out of the hou&s;e, through the en|try, I heard her &s;peak in a room, the door being &s;hut; going to the room widow, I heard two Gentlemen &s;peak, but knew not who they were at that time: Mr. Gl&mdash;r came out of the room and returned in about fifteen minutes, after which they &s;hortly came out, as I was &s;tanding near the room window. I expected that the Gentlemen would depart from her, and then intended to go home with her; but the Gentlemen took her one by the one arm, and the other by the
<PB N="10" REF="012936_0009_0F903F4904894140">
other arm, and &s;o went away. It is not ea&s;y for me to relate how I felt. As I had given her liberty be|fore that time to act in &s;uch a manner, according to the proverb, <HI>What the eye don't &s;ee the heart don't grieve at</HI> yet, I confe&s;s, I had no right to meddle with the Gentlemen; but the devil whom I faithfully &s;erv|ed at that time, drew near and tempted me to get a weapon, making me believe if I could &s;trike one or both of them and take away my wife it would appear in the eyes of &s;ome of my neighbours that I was an hone&s;t man, and innocent of her doings; with this re&s;olution I went into the hou&s;e where they had been, and &s;ee|ing no other weapon, unfortunately took the wooden bar of the door, and having pur&s;ued and overtaken them, made a blow which &s;truck Mr. Robert W&mdash;to on his head, and by it he fell to the ground. My wife ran off: Upon recovering the weapon to defend my|&s;elf, Mr. Gl&mdash;r enclo&s;ed me, letting the bar fall to the ground. I fought with my hands After a &s;hort combat; Mr. Gl&mdash;r begged his life; I &s;aid it was granted: Whereupon he a&s;ked me, why I had had &s;truck Mr. Wh&mdash;te? For being in company with my wife, in a bad hou&s;e at an un&s;ea&s;onable hour, &s;aid I: Upon my honour &s;aid he, I had no connection with her, nor have I rea&s;on to believe that Mr. Wh&mdash;te had? I replied, if they were innocent I was &s;orry that I &s;truck them. In the fray I lo&s;t my hat, and &s;o did Mr. Gl&mdash;r his. While &s;eeking for them, I con&s;ider|ed, as Mr. Wh&mdash;te did not &s;tir, that he might be dangerou&s;ly wounded; therefore, finding Mr. Gl&mdash;r's hat and my own, and &s;eeing &s;ome people approach, I made immediately off with them both. I was at home &s;ome time before my wife came, and told my landlady what happened, in order to make her believe that I was innocent of what my wife followed. I went to bed that might, and after ri&s;ing in the morning, took Mr. Gl&mdash;r's hat, and give it to a neighbour to keep, where I &s;uppo&s;e it remains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The account of his pur&s;uit and apprehen&s;ion, add|ing in not (<HI>b</HI>) at the end, is not in his MS.</NOTE>.</P>

Herein God is glorified for putting a &s;top to the &s;inful cour&s;e that my wife and I followed, (as it was altogether abominable in his &s;ight, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity) by detecting, apprehending and executing of me; for though I did not intend to kill Mr. White, when I &s;truck him; yet, as it proved the cau&s;e of his death, I confe&s;s I am guilty of the murder of him, ina&s;much as I had given my wife the liberty before-mentioned. Some people have &s;aid, that it was a made up thing be|tween my wife and me; but it is fal&s;e, neither do I blame her in the lea&s;t, as I am the &s;inful wretch, and really guilty, and none el&s;e: Why then &s;hould I &s;trive to conceal that from the world, which is well known unto God?</P>
<P>Thus you may read how great a &s;inner I have been. I have provoked God times without number, procured his wrath daily, &s;erved the Devil faithfully, de&s;erved nothing, had I my de&s;erts, but everla&s;ting damnation; &s;everal other heinous, &s;oul damning &s;ins have I com|mitted, which are not here mentioned; and yet, af|ter &s;erving the Devil &s;o long, having been guilty of &s;o many crimes of the deepe&s;t dye, yet God was plea&s;ed to draw me from the mouth of the pit, to pluck me out of everla&s;ting burnings, and to receive me even at the eleventh hour, and to give me the knowledge of him&s;elf in and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Oh! the riches of the free grace of God to &s;uch a &s;inful wretch as I am, as I &s;hall endeavour to make appear as well as I am able, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the grace of God. The la&s;t day of July I received &s;entence of death; I knowing that I was then out of Chri&s;t, prayed for a long day for repentance, and &s;ix weeks were granted me. Certainly, if I had been put to death at that time, I &s;hould have been a lo&s;t &s;oul, for my con&s;cience was a hell to me, and witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t me: I then &s;aw hell open, as it were, to receive me, and could then &s;ee no way of e&s;cape, for I was almo&s;t in de&s;pair, and was in dread that the holy Spirit of
<PB N="12" REF="012936_0011_0F903F4A89494608">
God was withdrawn from me, never more to return. The condition I was then in I am unable to expre&s;s. I came to pri&s;on, was put in the condemned room, where I &s;at very melancholy, and expected &s;ome of the Clergy to come and &s;ee me. I &s;ent for a Divine of the Church of England, but he did not come ju&s;t then. I then &s;ent for Mr. Pilmore, a Methodi&s;t Mi|ni&s;ter, but he did not come that day, which made me almo&s;t think that I was for&s;aken of God and his Mi|ni&s;ters too. I was advi&s;ed to &s;end for Mr. L&mdash;le&mdash;d, a Methodi&s;t; I accordingly did: He came, with two others, and advi&s;ed me much; I declared that I was a great &s;inner, and that I had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed God's holy laws, de&s;pi&s;ed his coun&s;els, and grieved his holy Spi|rit, and was not worthy to take his holy name into my polluted lips: He coun&s;elled me not to de&s;pair, and made mention of &s;everal great &s;inners whom the Lord had made monuments of his mercy, which are record|ed in the holy Scriptures. He came three or four times, advi&s;ed me much, prayed and &s;ung whenever he came, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, the Lord was plea&s;ed to make him an in&s;trument in his hands, of &s;ome good to me. Perhaps, the reader will be glad to know how I was delivered from the fear of hell: It was done in &s;o &s;hort a time, that I can &s;carce tell; this I know, I prayed earne&s;tly to God, after I was awaken|ed and alarmed, that he would be plea&s;ed to pluck me as a brand from the burning: The Lord &s;hewed me the danger I was in, the follies and madne&s;s of my pa&s;t life, in living &s;o many years without God in the world, he was plea&s;ed to &s;hew me that I was un|der the cur&s;e of a broken law, and that if I departed this life, without an intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that I mu&s;t be eternally lo&s;t; therefore, &s;eeing Chri&s;t the Saviour, and none el&s;e, I prayed him to be merciful to me for his own Name's &s;ake, plead his own mo&s;t gra|cious promi&s;es, which he hath left on record, de&s;ired him to &s;ave me, el&s;e I pari&s;h, importuning him con|&s;tantly until he was plea&s;ed to hear me and grant my

reque&s;ts. The fir&s;t mark or in&s;tance I had of it, was this, my troubled con&s;cience was at ea&s;e, my &s;lavi&s;h fears were taken away; I now no more dreaded hell; Chri&s;t Je&s;us was altogether lovely to me: I could &s;ee that my &s;ins crucifyed him, which grieved me: My impri&s;onment, my death, and the puni&s;hment due to &s;in did not move me; now nothing troubled me, but the thought of having offended &s;o good a God &s;o of|ten as I had done. The Lord was plea&s;ed to give me &s;o much of his divine pre&s;ence, that I was &s;o lifted up, that I thought it was all well, imagining that I was quite out of danger, I almo&s;t forgot how nigh I was to everla&s;ting damnation; but the Lord being willing to let me &s;ee and know that of my&s;elf I was nothing, permitted Satan to tempt me, I being a poor weak creature when left to my&s;elf, and not calling on the Lord to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, was &s;oon overcome; after Satan got that advantage of me, I was ca&s;t down &s;o low that he made me believe all my former peace was a delu|&s;ion; I was between hope and de&s;pair, was in dread to pray, le&s;t it &s;hould be an abomination to the Lord; at this time Mr. L&mdash;le&mdash;d came into the room, and was in&s;trumental in leading me to prayer.</P>

<P>GOOD people and bad: But, Why did I &s;ay good? There is none good, no not one. Whatever you are, whither rich or poor, learned or not, that read this, be a&s;&s;ured that you mu&s;t ta&s;te death as well as I, and in a &s;hort &s;pace of time. Your delicate bo|dies mu&s;t be meat for worms, mu&s;t lay rotting in cor|ruption as well as mine. You are all certain of death, but uncertain when you mu&s;t die; and there is nothing more &s;ure, than that you mu&s;t appear be|fore the judgment-&s;eat of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to give an account of the deeds done in the body. Know|ing, therefore, that all this is true, there are three things which &s;hould make a &s;inner, out of Chri&s;t trem|ble: The fir&s;t is, When the &s;oul is to depart from his body. The &s;econd, When it is to appear before God to receive judgment: And the third, When &s;en|tence is pronounced. Oh! how terrible then will death be to a &s;inner. O dreadful moment, which cuts the thread of time, and begins the web of eter|nity. It is not the mo&s;t terrible con&s;equence of
<PB N="15" REF="012936_0014_0F903F4F681E91A0">
death, to leave this world; but it is, to give an ac|count of our actions unto the Creator of the world, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a time, when you cannot look for mercy. The thoughts of appearing before a holy God, made even Job tremble, who was &s;o ju&s;t, that the Almighty him&s;elf rejoiced in having &s;uch a &s;er|vant. If Job trembled, then, methinks, &s;inners out of Chri&s;t, have greater cau&s;e to tremble; for, if they depart out of this life in an unconverted &s;tate, how will it amaze them, to behold the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf alive; not a dead image, nor in that &s;tate of humiliation when he &s;uffered on the cro&s;s; but upon a throne of maje&s;ty, and &s;eat of ju&s;tice: Not in a time of mercy, but in the hour of vengeance: Not naked, tho' with pierced hands, but armed again&s;t &s;inners with the &s;word of ju&s;tice, when he will come to judge and revenge the injuries which they have done him: God is as righteous in his ju&s;tice, as in his mercy; and, as he hath allotted a time for mercy, &s;o he will for ju&s;tice. O &s;inners, think of the&s;e great truths, and con&s;ider the things that belong to your everla&s;ting peace, before it is too late. Remember, O &s;inners, that you were born into this world under the wrath of God, by rea&s;on of the original tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion committed by your forefather Adam, and &s;ee that every &s;in which thou committe&s;t, de&s;erves nothing but God's wrath and everla&s;ting damnation. Per|haps, &s;ome think that they are already Chri&s;tians, and converted to God, becau&s;e they have been baptized in their infancy, and brought up in &s;uch a church: But, my friend, whoever thou art, that harbours this opinion, without being born anew of the Spirit of God, you are as yet mi&s;taken; for that was the very thought that I built my profe&s;&s;ion upon for many years, to my grief, and if I had departed this life in that &s;tate, I &s;hould have been infallibly lo&s;t: there|fore, as I am a dying man, I tell you with love to your &s;ouls, as Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;aid and confirmed it with an oath, &s;aying, <Q>Verily, verily, Except a

man be burn again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</Q> Thou drunkard, thou bold bla&s;phemer, thou thief, thou whorema&s;ter, thou Sabbath breaker, thou adulterer, thou fornicator, thou extortioner, thou unju&s;t dealer, thou liar, and thou daughters of hell, that are bond &s;laves, both you and your gue&s;ts, to the Devil; you, I &s;ay, that take delight in pro&s;titut|ing your bodies as common whores, rather than work for an hone&s;t living; do any, or either of you, here mentioned, think that you are Chri&s;tians, or that if death was to cut you off this day, that you would be received into the heavenly Jeru&s;alem, where no un|clean thing can enter. O! &s;ays the fooli&s;h &s;inner, death is not &s;o near me, I am yet young and hearty, but when I arrive at &s;uch an age, then will I repent: If I were to become &s;erious in my young days, I &s;hould lo&s;e all the plea&s;ures of this life. O! be it known to you, that if this is the language of your heart, you are deluded by your ma&s;ter, the Devil, who&s;e you are, and whom you &s;erve, whil&s;t carnally minded. Long was I deluded by him in the &s;ame manner, until he made me commit the crime for which I ju&s;tly die; and, if the Lord was not plea&s;ed to make me a monument of his mercy and free grace, I &s;hould &s;uffer in hell to all eternity. O &s;inners! con|&s;ider how my &s;ins brought be to this end; and remem|ber my words, your &s;ins, if not repented of, will bring you to eternal torments. Con&s;ider, you are ever dy|ing while in the body, &s;till drawing nigher the grave; therefore, you &s;hould be always ready. O young peo|ple! do ye &s;eek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near, for the Lord has made a gracious promi&s;e unto you; he has &s;aid in his word, that they that &s;eek him early, &s;hall find him let old hardened &s;inners go on to &s;erve the Devil, if they are &s;o minded; but, you young &s;inners, &s;eek ye the Lord in your youthful days, and you &s;hall find thim, and you old hardened &s;inners, who&s;e heads are gray, who&s;e looks of hair may be called the blo&s;&s;oms of

the grave; methinks you have been &s;laves to the De|vil long enough, if you could but know it; beg of the Lord, therefore, to &s;hew you what you are by nature and by practice. Here is encouragement for all &s;inners, old and young, be their &s;ins ever &s;o nu|merous, ever &s;o heinous, or of ever &s;o deep a dye, yet the blood of Chri&s;t Je&s;us is able and all-&s;ufficient to clean&s;e from all &s;in and iniquity; and &s;eeing that the Lord is gracious unto me at the eleventh hour, in a pri&s;on room, to me that has been in vile&s;t of wretch|es; methinks, every &s;inner ought to come and try the Lord, Oh! the goodne&s;s of God, the riches of free grace in and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Now, if you &s;eek the Lord, you'll certainly find him; his promi&s;es are &s;uch, that the heavens and the earth &s;hall pa&s;s away, but one jot or title of his word &s;hall not fail. If you neglect it, and obey not the &s;ound of the Go&s;pel, now in your day, be it known unto you, that you mu&s;t obey the &s;ound of the trump of God at the la&s;t day, when the angel of the Lord &s;hall &s;ound it, and cry aloud, Ari&s;e ye dead and come to judgment; then, O &s;inners, ye mu&s;t come whether you will or no: as you die judgment will find you; as the tree fall|eth, &s;o it doth lie: If death &s;weep you off this day, in your &s;ins, where do you think you will find your|&s;elf; certainly in torments, never to cea&s;e. O then flee from the wrath to come unto the city of refuge, unto a crucified Je&s;us, unto the Lamb of God, who takes away the &s;ins of the world of believers; con|fe&s;s your &s;ins unto him, for he alone is able to clean&s;e you from them by his atoning blood, and is ever rea|lly and willing to do it, if you &s;hould think your&s;elves unworthy by rea&s;on of your many offences; remem|ber me, the chief of &s;inners, that as the Lord was gracious to me, &s;o will he be to you, if you diligently &s;eek him. Is not the blood of Chri&s;t &s;ufficient to clean&s;e from all &s;ins? and, is not God able and willing to &s;ave all that come unto him in and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t? But, if you that are filthy remain filthy &s;till,

till death comes unawares, and cuts you off. Alas! for your poor &s;ouls, it were better for you never to have been born. The day of judgment will be an awful, &s;hocking, dreadful day to you; when the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will come in the clouds of heaven, in power and great glory, with his holy angels, in flam|ing fire, to take vengeance on them who know not God, and have not obeyed the Go&s;pel. Who will be able to bear everla&s;ting burnings? How will it grieve you, when you &s;ee them that were greater &s;inners than you, placed at the right hand of the Judge, waiting for a crown of immortal glory, and you your&s;elves at the left hand, waiting for the word, Depart! ye cur&s;ed! into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels! O terrible &s;entence! depart! alas dread Sovereign, whereto? Into hell! into everla&s;t|ing torments! where the God of heaven will pour forth his wrath on the damned &s;ouls to all eternity! Oh &s;inners! of all ranks and conditions tremble! And ye harlots of the city of New-York, and you inn-keepers, that entertain &s;uch in your hou&s;es; and you married or young men that are &s;o led by the Devil, tremble, for you are all in danger of dropping into hell every moment, and certainly will if death overtakes you before you have got an intere&s;t in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, then if you intend to e&s;cape the wrath to come; if you &s;eek or de&s;ire the &s;alvation of your own &s;ouls, fly from &s;in, &s;hun every appearance of evil; &s;hun gaming, drinking, lying; &s;hun bad com|pany of all &s;orts; keep holy the Sabbath of the Lord, attend to hear the word of God preached with an earne&s;t de&s;ire to benefit thereby, for&s;aking all your former &s;ins and iniquities, and praying to the Lord con&s;tantly, and then no doubt the Lord will ble&s;s a word from one or another of his mini&s;tering &s;er|vants to your hard hearts, to the breaking of them in pieces. The word of God is like unto a hammer, &s;harper, then a two-edged &s;word when it comes with power, and if the Lord is plea&s;ed to ble&s;s a word
<PB N="19" REF="012936_0018_0F903F52C525EAB8">
unto you, then will you &s;ee the danger you are in; and if God &s;o begins that work, the Lord Je&s;us will certainiy give you repentance, and will take away the heart of &s;tone, and give you a heart of fle&s;h. Then thus much being done by the grace of God, your mind, your will, and the powers of your &s;oul will be changed by the Spirit of God from darkne&s;s unto light, and from the power of Satan unto the everliv|ing and true God; your feet, formerly &s;o nimble to run into de&s;truction, will now be employed in go|ing to the hou&s;e of God, and attending on his ordi|nances; your eyes that lu&s;ted after all manner of vanities, will be now fixed on the words of &s;alvation, the te&s;timony of his will, the &s;acred Scriptures.

<HEAD>OF MY EXPERIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was condemned, I &s;aw my&s;elf out of Chri&s;t. I &s;aw that I was under the cur&s;e of a broken law, that I was a child of hell, a bond &s;lave to the Devil for many years, which threw me almo&s;t into de&s;pair. Knowing that God was ju&s;t, and that my &s;ins had overtaken me. My neglecting the calls of mercy &s;o often in my pa&s;t life, made me think that the Lord would not hear me now. The day after I was condemned, I had but little hopes; my pa&s;t life being in my view, was a great &s;hock to me. The 2d day of Augu&s;t, my burden was great, and my trou|bled con&s;cience was a hell to me. But, happily, be|fore a week was expired, the fear of hell was taken away from me, and my troubled con&s;cience was at re&s;t. I &s;aw that the blood of Chri&s;t was fully &s;uffici|ent to clean&s;e from all &s;in and iniquity. When the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t came to &s;ee me, I did not let them know that I enjoyed this peace, for, I was in dread lea&s;t I &s;hould be deceived. After I enjoyed this peace two or three days, then I made it known, and was &s;o lifted up with inward frames and feelings, that I al|mo&s;t forgot what God had done for me, in plucking me like unto a brand out of the burning: Then I thought that I was pa&s;t all danger; but God was plea&s;ed to let me &s;ee that I was nothing of my&s;elf, in the following manner: Satan tempted me to &s;in, and I not being on my guard, was overcome: Satan re|mained near me a long while, and overcame me a &s;e|cond time, then he wanted to make me de&s;pair: He conquered me &s;o far, that he made me believe, all my former peace was a delu&s;ion; then I was in dread to go to prayer, le&s;t it &s;hould be an abomination to the Lord. I was in great di&s;tre&s;s for &s;ome time, until I was told of the goodne&s;s of God in different manners, which, when I had heard, I bur&s;t into tears; then was I &s;lain. After that, I could draw nigh to God in
<PB N="21" REF="012936_0020_0F903F5457E2A3A8">
Prayer, in an humble manner, but had many wre&s;tlings with Satan, yet the Lord helped me to re&s;i&s;t. I then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> enjoyed inward peace, but it was a con&s;iderable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> before I could &s;ay Chri&s;t &s;uffered for me. This <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that I could not be &s;aved without a Saviour. I knew and believed, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us was the pro|mi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, the Anointed of God, and I tru&s;ted on him, his blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and on none el&s;e. The Lord &s;hewed me, that I had nothing in me that could commend me to God, therefore I continually pleaded the promi&s;es of Chri&s;t, until he was plea&s;ed to give me faith, that I could &s;ay he &s;uffered for me. I always gained ground by the in&s;tructions of the Mi|ni&s;ters; yet was tempted by Satan, after all this, to unbelief; but the Lord gave me to know it was a temptation, and helped me to overcome. I &s;aw that I was given much to &s;piritual pride at times, which made me pray God to humble me. The week be|fore my death, I was &s;o lifted up at times, and to that degree, that the approaching death &s;eemed a comfort to me; yet, at one time I could find my faith &s;tronger than at another. I could &s;ay, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us rai&s;ed me from death to life. Nay, I was twice dead; dead in &s;in, and dead by the laws of man, agreeable to the ju&s;tice of God. Before I was brought to life &s;aving|ly by God, in and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and as I am &s;hortly to die a &s;hameful death, which I brought upon my&s;elf, by rea&s;on of living &s;o long without God in the world; yet I would die this death, in the confu&s;ion I am now in, rather than live in this world, to be carnally minded, as u&s;ual. I die now to live eternally. Glory be to God for his free gift, be&s;tow|ed on me a vile &s;inner. I die, though mo&s;t unwor|thy of the title, one of the I&s;rael of God, and an heir of glory.</P>
