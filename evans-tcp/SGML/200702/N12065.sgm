<P>THERE is not a greater evidence either of the reality or the power of religion, than a firm belief of God's uni|ver&s;al pre&s;ence, and a con&s;tant attention to the influence and operation of his pro|vidence. It is by this means that the Chri&s;tian may be &s;aid, in the emphatical &s;cripture language, <HI>to walk with God, and to endure as &s;eeing him who is invi|&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="015224_0004_0F97835157401278">THE doctrine of divine providence is ve|ry full and complete in the &s;acred oracles. It extends not only to things which we may think of great moment, and there|fore worthy of notice, but to things the mo&s;t indifferent and incon&s;iderable: <HI>Are not two &s;parrows &s;old for a farthings,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>and one of them falleth not on the ground without your heavenly Father; nay, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</HI> It extends not only to things beneficial and &s;alutary, or to the direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who are the &s;er|vants of the living God; but to things &s;eemingly mo&s;t hurtful and de&s;tructive, and to per&s;ons the mo&s;t refractory and di&s;obedient. He over-rules all his crea|tures, and all their actions. Thus we are told, that <HI>fire, hail, &s;now, vapour, and &s;tormy wind, fulfil his word,</HI> in the cour&s;e of nature; and even &s;o the mo&s;t impetu|ous and di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions of men, that are under no re&s;traint from them&s;elves, are yet perfectly &s;ubject to the dominion of Jehovah. They carry his commi&s;&s;ion, they obey his orders, they are limited and re&s;trained by his authority, and they con|&s;pire with every thing el&s;e in promoting
<PB N="3" REF="015224_0005_0F97835225736700">
his glory. There is the greater need to take notice of this, that men are not ge|nerally &s;ufficiently aware of the di&s;tincti|on between the law of God and his pur|po&s;e; they are apt to &s;uppo&s;e, that as the temper of the &s;inner is contrary to the one, &s;o the outrages of the &s;inner are able to defeat the other; than which nothing can be more fal&s;e. The truth is plainly a&s;&s;erted, and nobly expre&s;&s;ed by the P&s;al|mi&s;t in the text, <HI>Surely the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee; the remainder of wrath &s;hall thou re&s;train.</HI></P>
<P>THIS p&s;alm was evidently compo&s;ed as a &s;ong of prai&s;e for &s;ome &s;ignal victory obtained, which was at the &s;ame time a remarkable deliverance from threatning danger. The author was one or other of the later prophets, and the occa&s;ion probably the un&s;ucce&s;sful a&s;&s;ault of Jeru&s;alem, by the army of Senacherib king of A&s;&s;yria, in the days of Hezekiah. Great was the in&s;olence and boa&s;ting of his generals and &s;ervants again&s;t the city of the living God, as may be &s;een in the thirty-&s;ixth chapter of I&s;aiah. Yet it plea&s;ed God to de&s;troy their enemies, and, by his own
<PB N="4" REF="015224_0006_0F978352F4B93CF8">
immediate interpo&s;ition, to grant them deliverance. Therefore the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays in the fifth and &s;ixth ver&s;es of this p&s;alm, <HI>The &s;tout-hearted are &s;poiled, they have &s;lept their &s;leep. None of the men of might have found their hands. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob! both the chariot and the hor&s;e are call into a deep &s;leep.</HI> After a few more remarks to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, he draws the inference, or makes the re|flection in the text, <HI>Surely the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee; the remainder of wrath &s;halt thou re&s;train:</HI> which may be paraphra&s;ed thus, The fury and inju&s;tice of oppre&s;&s;ors, &s;hall bring in a tribute of prai&s;e to thee; the influence of thy righ|teous providence &s;hall be clearly di&s;cern|ed; the countenance and &s;upport thou wilt give to thine own people &s;hall be gloriou&s;ly illu&s;rated; thou &s;halt &s;et the bounds which the bolde&s;t cannot pa&s;s.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, my brethren, that the time and occa&s;ion of this p&s;alm, may &s;eem to be in one re&s;pect ill &s;uited to the inte|re&s;ting circum&s;tances of this country at pre&s;ent. It was compo&s;ed after the victo|ry was obtained; whereas we are now
<PB N="5" REF="015224_0007_0F9783549AD68390">
but putting on the harne&s;s, and entering upon an important conte&s;t, the length of which it is impo&s;&s;ible to for&s;ee, and the i&s;&s;ue of which it will perhaps be thought pre&s;umption to foretell. But as the truth, with re&s;pect to God's moral government, is the &s;ame and unchangeable; as the i&s;&s;ue, in the ca&s;e of Senacherib's inva&s;ion, did but lead the prophet to acknowledge it; our duty and intere&s;t con&s;pire in calling upon us to improve it. And I have cho&s;en to in|&s;i&s;t upon it on this day of &s;olemn humili|ation as it will probably help us to a clear and explicit view of what &s;hould be the chief &s;ubject of our prayers and endea|vours, as well as the great object of our hope and tru&s;t, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>THE truth, then, a&s;&s;erted in this text, which I propo&s;e to illu&s;trate and improve, is,&mdash;<HI>That all the di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions of men, whether expo&s;ing the innocent to private injury, or whether they are the arrows of divine judgment in public cala|mity, &s;hall, in the end, be to the prai&s;e of God</HI>: Or, to apply it more particularly to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the American Co|lonies, and the plague of war,&mdash;<HI>The am|bition
<PB N="6" REF="015224_0008_0F978355147B7050">
of mi&s;taken princes, the cunning and cruelty of oppre&s;&s;ive and corrupt mini&s;ters, and even the inhumanity of bruial &s;ol|diers, however dreadful, &s;hall finally pro|mote the glory of God, and in the mean|time, while the &s;torm continues, his mercy and kindne&s;s &s;hall appear in pre&s;cribing bounds to their rage and fury.</HI></P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing of this &s;ubject, it is my intention, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace,</P>
<P N="1">I. To point out to you in &s;ome particu|lars, how the wrath of man prai&s;es God.</P>
<P N="2">II. To apply the&s;e principles to our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, by inferences of truth for your in&s;truction and comfort, and by &s;uitable exhortations to duty in the im|portant cri&s;is&punc;</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, I am to point out to you in &s;ome particulars, how the wrath of man prai&s;es God. I &s;ay in <HI>&s;ome</HI> in|&s;tances, becau&s;e it is far from being in my power, either to mention or explain the whole. There is an un&s;earchable depth in
<PB N="7" REF="015224_0009_0F978355D283B348">
the divine coun&s;els, which it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to penetrate. It is the duty of eve|ry good man to place the mo&s;t unlimited confidence in divine wi&s;dom, and to believe that tho&s;e mea&s;ures of provi|dence that are mo&s;t unintelligible to him, are yet planned with the &s;ame &s;kill, and directed to the &s;ame great purpo&s;es as o|thers, the rea&s;on and tendency of which he can explain in the cleare&s;t manner. But where revelation and experience ena|bles us to di&s;cover the wi&s;dom, equity, or mercy of divine providence, nothing can be more delightful or profitable to a &s;eri|ous mind, and therefore I beg your at|tention to the following remarks.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, the wrath of man prai&s;es God, as it is an example and il|lu&s;tration of divine truth, and clearly points out the corruption of our nature, which is the foundation &s;tone of the doc|trine of redemption. Nothing can be more ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to true religion, than a clear and full conviction of the &s;in|fulne&s;s of our nature and &s;tate. Without this there can be neither repentance in the
<PB N="8" REF="015224_0010_0F9783569AA69DD8">
&s;inner, nor humility in the believer. Without this all that is &s;aid in &s;cripture of the wi&s;dom and mercy of God, in pro|viding a Saviour, is without force and without meaning. Ju&s;tly does our Saviour &s;ay, <HI>The whole have no need of a phy&s;ici|an, but tho&s;e that are &s;ick. I came not to call the righteous but &s;inners to repentance.</HI> Tho&s;e who are not &s;en&s;ible that they are &s;inners, will treat every exhortation to re|pentance, and every offer of mercy, with di&s;dain or defiance.</P>
<P>BUT where can we have a more affec|ting view of the corruption of our na|ture, than in the wrath of man, when exerting it&s;elf in oppre&s;&s;ion, cruelty, and blood. It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that this truth is abundantly manife&s;t in times of the greate&s;t tranquillity. Others may, if they plea&s;e, treat the corruption of our nature as a chimera; for my part, I &s;ee it every where, and I feel it every day. All the di&s;orders in human &s;ociety, and the great|e&s;t part even of the unhappine&s;s we are ex|po&s;ed to, ari&s;es from the envy, malice, co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, and other lu&s;ts of man. If we
<PB N="9" REF="015224_0011_0F97835756259228">
and all about us were ju&s;t what we ought to be in all re&s;pects, we &s;hould not need to go any further for heaven, for it would be upon earth. But war and vio|lence pre&s;ent a &s;pectacle, &s;till more awful. How affecting is it to think, that the lu&s;t of domination &s;hould be &s;o violent and univer&s;al? That men &s;hould &s;o rarely be &s;atisfied with their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and acqui&s;itions, or even with the benefit that would ari&s;e from mutual &s;ervice, but &s;hould look upon the happine&s;s and tran|quillity of others, as an ob&s;truction to their own. That, as if the great law of nature were not enough, <HI>Du&s;t thou art, and to du&s;t thou &s;halt return,</HI> they &s;hould be &s;o furiou&s;ly &s;et for the de&s;truc|tion of each other. It is &s;hocking to think, &s;ince the fir&s;t murder of Abel by his brother Cain, what havock has been made of man by man in every age. What is it that fills the pages of hi&s;tory, but the wars and contentions of princes and empires? What va&s;t numbers has lawle&s;s ambition brought into the field, and delivered as a prey to the de&s;tructive &s;word?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="015224_0012_0F9783581878B5A0">IF we dwell a little upon the circum|&s;tances, they become deeply affecting. The mother bears a child with pain, rears him by the laborious attendance of many years; yet in the prime of life, in the vigour of health, and bloom of beauty, in a moment he is cut down by the dreadful in&s;truments of death. <HI>Every battle of the warrior is with confu&s;ed noi&s;e, and garments rolled in blood;</HI> but the horror of the &s;cene is not confined to the field of &s;laughter. Few go there un|related, or fall unlamented; in every ho&s;|tile encounter, what mu&s;t be the impre&s;|&s;ion upon the relations of the decea&s;ed? The bodies of the dead can only be &s;een, or the cries of the dying heard for a &s;in|gle day, but many days &s;hall not put an end to the mourning of a parent for a be|loved &s;on, the joy and &s;upport of his age, or of the widow and helple&s;s offspring for a father, taken away in the fullne&s;s of health and vigour.</P>
<P>BUT if this may be ju&s;tly &s;aid of all wars between man and man, what &s;hall we be able to &s;ay that is &s;uitable to the
<PB N="11" REF="015224_0013_0F978358D3E5E710">
abhorred &s;cene of civil war between citi|zen and citizen? How deeply affecting is it, that tho&s;e who are the &s;ame in com|plexion, the &s;ame in blood, in language, and in religion, &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, butcher one another with unrelenting rage, and glory in the deed? That men &s;hould lay wa&s;te the fields of their fellow &s;ubjects, with who&s;e provi&s;ion they them|&s;elves had been often fed, and con&s;ume with devouring fire tho&s;e hou&s;es, in which they had often found a ho&s;pitable &s;helter.</P>
<P>THESE things are apt to overcome a weak mind with fear, or overwhelm it with &s;orrow, and in the greate&s;t number are apt to excite the highe&s;t indignation, and kindle up a &s;pirit of revenge. If this la&s;t has no other tendency than to direct and invigorate the mea&s;ures of &s;elf-defence, I do not take upon me to blame it, on the contrary, I call it nece&s;&s;ary and laudable.</P>
<P>BUT what I mean at this time to prove by the preceding reflections, and wi&s;h
<PB N="12" REF="015224_0014_0F978359907D5FE0">
to impre&s;s on your minds, is the depra|vity of our nature. <HI>From whence come wars and fightings among you,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle James *, <HI>come they not hence even from your lu&s;ts that war in your members.</HI> Men of lax and corrupt principles, take great delight in &s;peaking to the prai&s;e of human nature, and extolling its dignity, without di&s;tingui&s;hing what it was, at its fir&s;t creation, from what it is in its pre&s;ent fallen &s;tate. The&s;e fine &s;peculations are very grateful to a worldly mind. They are al&s;o much more pernicious to uncautious and unthinking youth, than even the temp|tations to a di&s;&s;olute and &s;en&s;ual life, a|gain&s;t which they are fortified by the dic|tates of natural con&s;cience, and a &s;en&s;e of public &s;hame. But I appeal from the&s;e vi&s;ionary rea&s;onings to the hi&s;tory of all ages, and the inflexible te&s;timony of daily experience. The&s;e will tell us what men have been in their practice, and from thence you may judge what they are by nature, while unrenewed. If I am not mi&s;taken, a cool and candid attention,

For as in Adam all &s;inned, and as in the fir&s;t electors all men obeyed; as in the one all mankind were &s;ubjected to Satan, and in the other to Sovereignty; as our innocence was lo&s;t in the fir&s;t, and our authority in the la&s;t; and as both di&s;able us from re-a&s;&s;uming &s;ome former &s;tate and privilege, it unan&s;werably follows that ori|ginal &s;in and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are parallels.

Without the &s;hadow of rea&s;oning, he is plea&s;ed to re|pre&s;ent the doctrine of original &s;in as an object of con|tempt or abhorrence. I beg leave to demur a little to the <HI>candor,</HI> the <HI>prudence,</HI> and the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of this pro|ceeding.</P>
<P N="1">1. Was it <HI>mode&s;t</HI> or <HI>candid</HI> for a per&s;on without name or character, to talk in this &s;upercilious manner of a doctrine that has been e&s;pou&s;ed and defended by many of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men that the world ever &s;aw, and makes an e&s;&s;ential part of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Creeds and Confe&s;&s;ions of all the Prote&s;tant churches without exception? I thought the grand modern plea had been freedom of &s;entiment, and charitable thoughts of one another. Are &s;o many of us, then, beyond the reach of this gentleman's charity? I do a&s;&s;ure him that &s;uch pre|&s;umption and &s;elf-confidence are no recommendation to me either of his character or &s;entiments.</P>
<P N="2">2. Was it <HI>prudent,</HI> when he was pleading a public cau&s;e, to &s;peak in &s;uch opprobrious terms of a doctrine, which he knew or ought to have known was believed and profe&s;&s;ed by, I &s;uppo&s;e, a great majority of very different denominations. Is this gentleman ignorant of human nature, as well as an enemy to the chri&s;tian faith? Are men &s;o little tenacious of their religious &s;entiments, whether true or fal&s;e? The prophet thought otherwi&s;e, who &s;aid, <HI>Hath a nation changed their gods which yet are no gods?</HI> Was it the way to obtain the favour of the public, to de&s;pi&s;e what they hold &s;acred? Or &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e this author &s;o a&s;toni&s;hingly ignorant, as to think that all men now, who&s;e favour is worth a&s;king, have given up the doctrine of the New Te&s;tament. If he does, he is greatly mi&s;taken.</P>
<P N="3">3. In fine, I a&s;k, where was the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of this pro|ceeding? Is there &s;o little to be &s;aid for the doctrine of original &s;in, that it is not to be refuted, but de&s;pi&s;ed? Is the &s;tate of the world &s;uch, as to render this doc|trine not only fal&s;e, but incredible? Has the fruit been of &s;uch a quality as to exclude all doubts of the good|ne&s;s of the tree? On the contrary, I cannot help being of opinion, that &s;uch has been the vi&s;ible &s;tate of the world in every age, as cannot be accounted for on any other principles, than what we learn from the word of God, that <HI>the imagination of the heart of man is only evil from his youth, and that continually</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi.5.&mdash;viii.21.</NOTE>.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>SO certain has this appeared, that the mo&s;t violent infidels, both of early and later ages, have endeavoured to ac|count for it, and have ob&s;erved that there is a &s;pirit of ob&s;tinacy in man which in|clines him to re&s;i&s;t violence, and that &s;e|verity doth but increa&s;e oppo&s;ition, be the cau&s;e what it will.

Such an apprehen&s;ion however gave oc|&s;ion to a glorious triumph of divine pro|vidence of an oppo&s;ite kind, which I mu&s;t &s;hortly relate to you. One of the Roman emperors, Julian, &s;urnamed the

He left the Chri&s;tians unmole&s;ted for &s;ometime, but gave all manner of en|couragement to tho&s;e of oppo&s;ite princi|ples, and particularly to the Jews, out of hatred to the Chri&s;tians; and that he might bring public di&s;grace upon the Ga|lileans, as he affected to &s;tile them, he encouraged the Jews to rebuild the temple 2of Jeru&s;alem, and vi&s;ibly refute the pro|phecy of Chri&s;t, that it &s;hould ly under perpetual de&s;olation. But this prophane attempt was &s;o &s;ignally fru&s;trated, that it &s;erved as much as any one circum&s;tance to &s;pread the glory of our redeemer, and e&s;tabli&s;h the faith of his &s;aints. It is af|firmed by &s;ome ancient authors, particu|larly by Ammianus Marcellinus a Hea|then hi&s;torian, that fire came out of the earth and con&s;umed the workmen when laying the foundation. But in whatever way it was prevented, it is beyond all controver&s;y, from the concurring te&s;timo|ny of Heathens and Chri&s;tians, that little or no progre&s;s was ever made in it, and that in a &s;hort time, it was entirely defeated.</P>

They had actually taken their pa&s;&s;age in a &s;hip for New-England, when by an ar|bitrary order of council they were com|pelled to remain at home. The con&s;e|quence of this was, that one of them was the &s;oul of the republican oppo&s;ition to monarchical u&s;urpation during the civil wars, and the other in the cour&s;e of that conte&s;t, was the great in&s;trument in bringing the tyrant to the block.</P>

Has not the boa&s;ted di&s;cipline of regu|lar and veteran &s;oldiers been turned into confu&s;ion and di&s;may before the new and maiden courage of freemen in defence of their property and right? In what great mercy has blood been &s;pared on the &s;ide of this injured country? Some important victories in the &s;outh have been gained with &s;o little lo&s;s, that enemies will pro|bably think it has been di&s;&s;embled; as many, even of our&s;elves thought, till time rendered it undeniable.

were comparatively of &s;mall moment. The &s;ignal advantage we have gained by the evacuation of Bo&s;ton, and the &s;hameful flight of the army and navy of Britain, was brought about without the lo&s;s of a man.

So far as we have hitherto proceeded, I am &s;atisfied that the confederacy of the colonies, has not been the effect of pride, re&s;entment, or &s;edition, but of a deep and general con|viction, that our civil and religious liber|ties, and con&s;equently in a great mea&s;ure the temporal and eternal happine&s;s of us and our po&s;terity depended on the i&s;&s;ue.

I have al|ready endeavoured to exhort &s;inners to re|pentance, what I have here in view is to point out to you the concern which every good man ought to take in the national character and manners, and the means which he ought to u&s;e for promoting pub|lic virtue, and bearing down impiety and vice. This is a matter of the utmo&s;t moment, and which ought to be well under&s;tood, both in its nature and prin|ciples. Nothing is more certain than that a general profligacy and corruption of manners makes a people ripe for de|&s;truction. A good form of government may hold the rotten materials together for &s;ome time, but beyond a certain pitch e|ven the be&s;t con&s;titution will be ineffec|tual, and &s;lavery mu&s;t en&s;ue.

of the mo&s;t powerful enemies to oppre&s;s them are commonly baffled and di&s;appointed. This will be found equal|ly certain, whether we con&s;ider the great principles of God's moral government, or the operation and influence of natural cau&s;es.</P>
<P>WHAT follows from this? That he is the be&s;t friend to American liberty, who is mo&s;t &s;incere and active in promoting true and undefiled religion, and who &s;ets him&s;elf with the greate&s;t firmne&s;s to bear down prophanity and immorality of eve|ry kind. Whoever is an avowed enemy to God, I &s;cruple not to call him an ene|my to his country. Do not &s;uppo&s;e, my brethren, that I mean to recommend a furious and angry zeal for the circum|&s;tantials of religion, or the contentions of one &s;ect with another about their peculiar di&s;tinctions. I do not wi&s;h you to op|po&s;e any body's religion, but every bo|dy's wickedne&s;s. Perhaps there are few &s;urer marks of the reality of religion, than when a man feels him&s;elf more join|ed in &s;pirit to a truly holy per&s;on of a different denomination, than to an irre|gular

liver of his own. It is therefore your duty in this important and critical &s;ea&s;on, to exert your&s;elves every one in his proper &s;phere to &s;tem the tide of pre|vailing vice, to promote the knowledge of God, the reverence of his name and wor&s;hip, and obedience to his laws.</P>
<P>PERHAPS you will a&s;k, what it is that you are called to do for this purpo&s;e far|ther than your own per&s;onal duty? I an|&s;wer this it&s;elf when taken in its proper extent is not a little.

<P>MANY from a real or pretended fear of the imputation of hypocri&s;y, bani&s;h from their conver&s;ation and carriage every ap|pearance of re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the living God. What a weakne&s;s and mean|ne&s;s of &s;pirit does it di&s;cover for a man to be a&s;hamed in the pre&s;ence of his fellow &s;inners, to profe&s;s that reverence to almighty God which he inwardly feels? The truth is, he makes him&s;elf truly liable to the accu&s;ation which he means to avoid. It is as genuine and
<PB N="53" REF="015224_0055_0F978385CFBA2750">
perhaps a more culpable hypocri&s;y to ap|pear to have le&s;s religion than you really have, than to appear to have more. This fal&s;e &s;hame is a more exten&s;ive evil than is commonly apprehended. We contri|bute con&s;tantly, though in&s;en&s;ibly, to form each others character and manners; and therefore, the u&s;efulne&s;s of a &s;trictly holy and con&s;cientious deportment is not confined to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, but &s;preads its happy influence to all that are within its reach. I need &s;carcely add, that in pro|portion as men are di&s;tingui&s;hed by un|der&s;tanding, literature, age, rank, office, wealth, or any other circum&s;tance, their example will be u&s;eful on the one hand, or pernicious on the other.</P>
<P>BUT I cannot content my&s;elf with barely recommending a &s;ilent example. There is a dignity in virtue which is en|titled to authority, and ought to claim it. In many ca&s;es it is the duty of a good man, by open reproof and oppo&s;ition, to wage war with prophanene&s;s. There is a &s;cripture precept delivered in very &s;ingu|lar terms, to which I beg your attention; <HI>Thou &s;halt not hate thy brother in thy
<PB N="54" REF="015224_0056_0F9783895BEB04B8">
heart, but &s;halt in any wi&s;e rebuke him, and not &s;uffer &s;in upon him.</HI> How prone are many to repre&s;ent reproof as flowing from ill nature and &s;urline&s;s of temper? The Spirit of God, on the contrary, con|&s;iders it as the effect of inward hatred, or want of genuine love, to forbear reproof when it is nece&s;&s;ary or may be u&s;eful. I am &s;en&s;ible there may in &s;ome ca&s;es be a re&s;traint from prudence, agreeably to that caution of Solomon, <HI>Ca&s;t not your pearls before &s;wine, le&s;t they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you.</HI> Of this every man mu&s;t judge as well as he can for him&s;elf; but certainly, either by open reproof, or expre&s;&s;ive &s;i|lence, or &s;peedy departure from &s;uch &s;o|ciety, we ought to guard again&s;t being <HI>partakers of other mens &s;ins.</HI></P>
<P>TO this let me add, that if all men are bound in &s;ome degree, certain cla&s;&s;es of men are under peculiar obligations to the di&s;charge of this duty. Magi&s;trates, mi|ni&s;ters, parents, heads of families, and tho&s;e whom age has rendered venerable, are called to u&s;e their authority and influ|ence for the glory of God and the good
<PB N="55" REF="015224_0057_0F97838AECD036B8">
of others. Bad men them&s;elves di&s;cover an inward conviction of this, for they are often liberal in their reproaches of per|&s;ons of grave characters or religious pro|fe&s;&s;ion, if they bear with patience the prophanity of others. In&s;tead of enlarg|ing on the duty of men in authority in general, I mu&s;t particularly recommend this matter to tho&s;e who have the com|mand of &s;oldiers inli&s;ted for the defence of their country. The cau&s;e is &s;acred, and the champions for it ought to be ho|ly. Nothing is more grieving to the heart of a good man, than to hear from tho&s;e who are going to the field, the horrid &s;ound of cur&s;ing and bla&s;phemy; it cools the ardor of his prayers, as well as abates his confidence and hope in God. Many more circum&s;tances affect me in &s;uch a ca&s;e, than I can enlarge upon, or indeed ea&s;ily enumerate at pre&s;ent; the glory of God, the intere&s;t of the deluded &s;inner, going like a devoted victim and imprecating vengeance on his own head, as well as the cau&s;e it&s;elf com|mitted to his care. We have &s;ome|times taken the liberty to forebode the
<PB N="56" REF="015224_0058_0F978B4A1A3AD030">
downfall of the Briti&s;h empire, from the corruption and degeneracy of the people. Unhappily the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers have been di&s;tingui&s;hed among all the nations in Europe, for the mo&s;t &s;hocking profanity. Shall we then pretend to emulate them in this infernal di&s;tinction, or rob them of the horrid privilege? God forbid. Let the officers of the army in every degree re|member, that as military &s;ubjection, while it la&s;ts, is the mo&s;t compleat of any, it is in their power greatly to re&s;train, if not wholly to bani&s;h, this flagrant enormity.</P>
<P N="2">2. I EXHORT all who are not called to go into the field to apply them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t diligence to works of indu&s;try. It is in your power by this means not only to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities, but to add to the &s;trength of your country. Habits of indu&s;try prevailing in a &s;ociety not only increa&s;e its wealth, as their immedi|ate effect, but they prevent the introduc|tion of many vices, and are intimately connected with &s;obriety and good morals. Idlene&s;s is ths mother or nur&s;e of almo&s;t every vice, and want, which is its in&s;epa|rable companion, urges men on to the
<PB N="57" REF="015224_0059_0F978B4B5FC19BB0">
mo&s;t abandoned and de&s;tructive cour&s;es. Indu&s;try, therefore, is a moral duty of the greate&s;t moment, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to national pro&s;perity, and the &s;ure way of obtaining the ble&s;&s;ing of God. I would al&s;o ob&s;erve, that in this, as in every other part of God's government, obedience to his will is as much a natural mean, as a meritorious cau&s;e of the advantage we wi&s;h to reap from it. Indu&s;try brings up a firm and hardy race. He who is inured to the labour of the field, is pre|pared for the fatigues of a campaign. The active farmer who ri&s;es with the dawn and follows his team or plow, mu&s;t in the end be an overmatch for tho&s;e effeminate and delicate &s;oldiers, who are nur&s;ed in the lap of &s;elf-indulgence, and who&s;e greate&s;t exertion is in the important pre|paration for, and tedious attendance on, a ma&s;querade, or midnight ball.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN the la&s;t place, &s;uffer me to re|commend to you frugality in your fami|lies, and every other article of expence. This the &s;tate of things among us renders ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and it &s;tands in the mo&s;t immediate connection both with vir|tuous

indu&s;try, and active public &s;pirit. Temperance in meals, moderation and decency in dre&s;s, furniture and equi|page, have, I think, generally been characteri&s;tics of a di&s;tingui&s;hed patriot. And when the &s;ame &s;pirit pervades a people in general, they are fit for every duty, and able to encounter the mo&s;t for|midable enemy. The general &s;ubject of the preceding di&s;cour&s;e has been the wrath of man prai&s;ing God. If the unju&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ion of your enemies, which with|holds from you many of the u&s;ual articles of luxury and magnificence, &s;hall contri|bute to make you clothe your&s;elves and your children with the works of your own hands, and cover your tables with the &s;alutary productions of your own &s;oil, it will be a new illu&s;tration of the &s;ame truth, and a real happine&s;s to your&s;elves and your country.</P>
<P>I COULD wi&s;h to have every good thing done from the pure&s;t principles and the noble&s;t views. Con&s;ider, therefore, that the Chri&s;tian character, particularly the &s;elf-denial of the go&s;pel, &s;hould ex|tend to your whole deportment. In the

early times of Chri&s;tianity, when adult converts were admitted to bapti&s;m, they were a&s;ked among other que&s;tions, Do you renounce the world, its &s;hews, its pomp, and its vanities? I do. The form of this is &s;till pre&s;erved in the admini&s;tra|tion of bapti&s;m, where we renounce the devil, the world, and the fle&s;h. This certainly implies not only ab&s;taining from acts of gro&s;s intemperance and exce&s;s, but a humility of carriage, a re&s;traint and moderation in all your de&s;ires. The &s;ame thing, as it is &s;uitable to your Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to make you truly independant in your&s;elves, and to feed the &s;ource of liberality and charity to others, or to the public. The riotous and wa&s;teful liver, who&s;e craving appe|tites make him con&s;tantly needy, is and mu&s;t be &s;ubject to many ma&s;ters, accord|ing to the &s;aying of Solomon, <HI>The bor|rower is &s;ervant to the lender.</HI> But the frugal and moderate per&s;on, who guides his affairs with di&s;cretion, is able to a&s;&s;i&s;t in public coun&s;els by a free and unbia&s;|&s;ed judgment, to &s;upply the wants of his poor brethren, and &s;ometimes, by his

<P>UPON the whole, I be&s;eech you to make a wi&s;e improvement of the pre&s;ent threat|ning a&s;pect of public affairs, and to re|member that your duty to God, to your country, to your families, and to your|&s;elves, is the &s;ame. True religion is no|thing el&s;e but an inward temper and out|ward conduct &s;uited to your &s;tate and cir|cum&s;tances in providence at any time. And as peace with God and conformity to him, adds to the &s;weetne&s;s of created comforts while we po&s;&s;e&s;s them, &s;o in times of difficulty and trial, it is in the man of piety and inward principle that we may expect to find the uncorrupted patriot, the u&s;eful citizen, and the in|vincible &s;oldier.&mdash;God grant that in America true religion and civil liberty may be in&s;eparable, and that the unju&s;t attempts to de&s;troy the one, may in the i&s;&s;ue tend to the &s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of both.</P>

<HEAD>An ADDRESS to the NATIVES of SCOT|LAND re&s;iding in AMERICA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Countrymen and Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS &s;oon as I had con&s;ented to the publication of the foregoing &s;ermon, I felt an irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;ire to accompany it with a few words addre&s;&s;ed to you in particular. I am certain I feel the attach|ment of country as far as it is a virtuous or laudable principle, perhaps it would be nearer the truth to &s;ay, as far as it is a natural and pardonable preju|dice. He who is &s;o plea&s;ed may attribute it to this la&s;t when I &s;ay, that I have never &s;een cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed of the place of my birth; that &s;ince the re|formation of letters in Europe in the clo&s;e of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth century, the natives of Scotland have not been inferior to tho&s;e of any other country, for genius, erudition, military prowe&s;s, or any of tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which improve or embelli&s;h human nature. When to this it is added, that &s;ince my coming to Ame|rica at an advanced period of life, the friend&s;hip of my countrymen has been as much above my ex|pectation as de&s;ert, I hope every reader will con&s;i|der what is now to be offered as the effect not only of unfeigned good will, but of the mo&s;t ardent af|fection.</P>
<P>It has given me no little unea&s;ine&s;s to hear the word <HI>Scotch</HI> u&s;ed as a term of reproach in the A|merican controver&s;y, which could only be upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;trangers of that country are more
<PB N="62" REF="015224_0064_0F978B50AD3B77C0">
univer&s;ally oppo&s;ed to the liberties of America than tho&s;e who were born in South-Britain, or in Ireland. I am &s;en&s;ible that this has been done in &s;ome news|papers and contemptible anonymous publications, in a manner that was neither warranted by truth, nor dictated by prudence. There are many natives of Scotland in this country, who&s;e oppo&s;ition to the unju&s;t claims of Great-Britain has been as early and uniform, founded upon as rational and liberal prin|ciples, and therefore likely to be as la&s;ting, as that of any &s;et of men whatever. As to Great Britain it&s;elf, time has now fully di&s;covered that the real friends of America in any part of that kingdom were very few, and tho&s;e who&s;e friend&s;hip was di&s;|intere&s;ted, and in no degree owing to their own political factions, &s;till fewer. The wi&s;e and valu|able part of the nation were, and as yet are, in a great mea&s;ure ignorant of the &s;tate of things in this country; neither is it ea&s;y for the bulk of a people to &s;hake off their prejudices, and open their eyes upon the great principles of univer&s;al liberty. It is therefore at lea&s;t very di&s;putable, whether there is any ju&s;t ground for the di&s;tinction between Scots and Engli&s;h on this &s;ubject at all.</P>
<P>This di&s;pute, however, I do not mean to enter upon, becau&s;e it is of too little moment to find a place here, but &s;uppo&s;ing that, in &s;ome provinces e&s;pecially, the natives of Scotland have been too much inlined to &s;upport the u&s;urpations of the parent &s;tate, I will fir&s;t endeavour to account for it, by a&s;&s;igning &s;ome of its probable cau&s;es; and then offer a few con&s;iderations which &s;hould induce them to wipe off the a&s;per&s;ion entirely, by a contrary con|duct.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="015224_0065_0F978B51B0D85D30">As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, I will mention what I &s;uppo&s;e to have been the fir&s;t and radical cau&s;e, and which gave birth to every other, of the di&s;affection of &s;ome of the natives of Scotland to the ju&s;t privi|leges of America. What I have in view was the friends of liberty in many places of America, taking the part of, and &s;eeming to con&s;ider them&s;elves as in a great mea&s;ure engaged in the &s;ame cau&s;e with, that very di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;on, John Wilkes, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of London, This was done not only in many writings and news-paper di&s;&s;ertations, but one or two colo|nies, in &s;ome of their mo&s;t re&s;pectable meetings, manife&s;ted their attachment to him, and &s;eemed to con&s;ider him as their patron and friend. No. 45, which was the mo&s;t offen&s;ive number of a worthle&s;s paper, was repeated and echoed, by the mo&s;t &s;illy and ridiculous allu&s;ions to it, through every part of the country, and by many who could not tell what was &s;ignified by the term.</P>
<P>It will not be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much on the pru|dence of &s;uch conduct, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e who expected Wilkes's mob would pull down the parli|ament- hou&s;e, or that there would be in&s;urrections all over the kingdom in behalf of America, are by this time fully &s;atisfied of their mi&s;take. It appears now in the cleare&s;t manner, that, till very lately, tho&s;e who &s;eemed to take the part of America in the Briti&s;h parliament, never did it on American principles. They either did not under&s;tand, or were not willing to admit, the extent of our claim. Even the great Lord Chatham's bill for reconciliati|on would not have been accepted here, and did not materially differ from what the mini&s;try would have con&s;ented to. The truth is, the far greate&s;t part
<PB N="64" REF="015224_0066_0F978B5259997F50">
of the countenance given in Britain to the com|plaints of this country, was by tho&s;e who had no other intention in it than to u&s;e them as an engine of oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;try for the time being. It is true, &s;ome of them have now learned to rea&s;on very ju&s;tly, and upon the mo&s;t liberal principles; but their number is not great, and it was not the ca&s;e with any one &s;peaker or writer, who&s;e works I have had the opportunity of peru&s;ing, till the very la&s;t &s;tage of the quarrel.</P>
<P>What effect this Wilki&s;m (if I may &s;peak &s;o) of many Americans may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had upon the minds of gentlemen from Scotland, it is not dif|ficult to explain. That gentleman and his a&s;&s;ociates thought proper to found the whole of their oppo&s;i|tion to the then mini&s;try, upon a contempt and hat|red of the Scots nation; and by the mo&s;t illiberal methods, and the mo&s;t &s;candalous fal&s;ehoods, to &s;tir up a national jealou&s;y between the northern and &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land. There was not a vile term or hateful idea, which ancient vulgar animo&s;i|ty had ever u&s;ed, though long union had made them &s;carcely intelligible, which he did not rake up and attempt to bring into credit, by writing and conver|&s;ation. The con&s;equence of this is well known. Wilkes and &s;ome others were burnt in effigy in Scot|land, and it produced &s;o general an attachment to the king and mini&s;try, as has not yet &s;pent its force. In the&s;e circum&s;tances is it to be wondered at that many who left Scotland within the la&s;t fifteen years, when they heard Wilkes and tho&s;e who adhered to him extolled and celebrated by the &s;ons of liberty, &s;hould be apt to con&s;ider it as an evidence of the &s;ame &s;pirit, and that they were engaged in &s;upport of the
<PB N="65" REF="015224_0067_0F978B531B316D00">
&s;ame cau&s;e. Perhaps we may go a little higher with this remark, in tracing political appearances to their &s;ource. It is generally &s;aid that the King him&s;elf has di&s;covered a violent rancorous per&s;onal hatred again&s;t the Americans. If this be true, and I know nothing to the contrary, it may be ea&s;ily accounted for upon the very &s;ame principles.</P>
<P>I am far from &s;uppo&s;ing that this was a good rea&s;on for any man's being cool to the American cau&s;e, which was as different from that of Wilkes, as light is from darkne&s;s. It was indeed doing great di&s;honour to the noble &s;truggle, to &s;uppo&s;e it to have any connection with who &s;hould be in or out of court-favour at London; and therefore it was always my opinion, that tho&s;e who railed again&s;t the King and mini&s;try only, did not carry the argu|ment home, nor fully under&s;tand the nature of their own plea. In order to ju&s;tify the American oppo|&s;ition, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew that the per&s;ons in power have invaded liberty in Britain; it is &s;uffi|cient to &s;ay that they, with the concurrence of the whole nation, have refu&s;ed to &s;uffer it to continue in the colonies.&mdash;This leads me to the &s;econd part of my de&s;ign, which was to lay before you the rea|&s;ons which, I think, &s;hould induce every lover of ju&s;tice and of mankind, not only to be a well-wi&s;her, but a firm and &s;tedfa&s;t friend to America, in this important conte&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been often &s;aid, that the pre&s;ent is likely to be an important aera to America. I think we may &s;ay much more; it is likely to be an important aera in the hi&s;tory of mankind. In the ancient migrations, a new country was generally &s;ettled by a &s;mall un|connected, and often an ignorant band. The people
<PB N="66" REF="015224_0068_0F978B53D096E708">
and the &s;oil were alike uncultivated, and therefore they proceeded to improvement by very &s;low de|grees; nay, many of them fell back and degene|rated into a &s;tate va&s;tly more &s;avage than the people from whence they came. In America we &s;ee a rich and valuable &s;oil and an exten&s;ive country, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the power, the learning, and the wealth of Europe. For this rea&s;on it is now exhi|biting to the world a &s;cene which was never &s;een be|fore. It has had a progre&s;s in improvement and population &s;o rapid as no political calculators have been able to a&s;certain. I look upon every thing that has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject to be mere conjec|ture, except in &s;uch places as there has been an ac|tual numeration. When men &s;ay that America doubles its number in fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years, they &s;peak by gue&s;s, and they &s;ay nothing. In &s;ome places that may be under or over the truth; but there are va&s;t tracts of land that fill every year with inhabitants, and yet the old &s;ettled places &s;till continue to increa&s;e.</P>
<P>It is proper to ob&s;erve that the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements have been improved in a proportion far beyond the &s;ettlements of other European nations. To what can this be a&s;cribed? Not to the climate; for they are of all climates: Not to the people; for they are a mixture of all nations. It mu&s;t therefore be re|&s;olved &s;ingly into the degree of Briti&s;h liberty which they brought from home, and which pervaded more or le&s;s their &s;everal con&s;titutions. It has been re|peated to us, I know not how often, by the mer|cenary &s;hort-&s;ighted writers in favour of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, or re-union with, Great Britain, that we have thriven very much in pa&s;t times by our dependance
<PB N="67" REF="015224_0069_0F978B5563961F68">
on the mother-country, and therefore we &s;hould be loth to part. The&s;e writers forget that the very com|plaint is, that &s;he will not &s;uffer us to enjoy our ancient rights. Can any pa&s;t experience &s;hew that we &s;hall thrive under new impo&s;itions? I &s;hould be glad any &s;uch rea&s;oners would attempt to prove that we have thriven by our dependence, and not by the degree of independence which we have hitherto en|joyed. If we have thriven by our dependance, I con|ceive it is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence that tho&s;e provin|ces mu&s;t have thriven mo&s;t which have been mo&s;t dependent. But the contrary is &s;elf-evident. Tho&s;e which have hitherto enjoyed the free&s;t form of go|vernment, though greatly inferior in &s;oil and climate, have yet out&s;tripped the others in number of people and value of land, merely becau&s;e the la&s;t were more under the influence of appointments and authority from home.</P>
<P>When this is the undeniable &s;tate of things, can any per&s;on of a liberal mind wi&s;h that the&s;e great and growing countries &s;hould be brought back to a &s;tate of &s;ubjection to a di&s;tant power? And can any man deny, that if they had yielded to the claims of the Briti&s;h parliament, they would have been no better than a parcel of tributary &s;tates, ruled by lordly tyrants, and exhau&s;ted by unfeeling pen&s;ion|ers, under the commi&s;&s;ion of one too di&s;tant to hear the cry of oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;urrounded by tho&s;e who had an intere&s;t in deceiving him. It ought, there|fore, in my opinion, to meet with the cordial appro|bation of every impartial per&s;on, as I am confident it will of po&s;terity, that they have united for com|mon defence, and re&s;olved that they will be both free and independent, becau&s;e they cannot be the one without the other.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="015224_0070_0F978B564AC2A768">As this mea&s;ure, long fore&s;een, has now taken place, I &s;hall beg leave to &s;ay a few things upon it; in which I mean to &s;how, 1. That it was nece&s;&s;ary. 2. That it will be honourable and profitable. And, 3. That, in all probability, it will be no injury, but a real advantage, to the i&s;land of Great Britain.</P>
<P N="1">1. It had become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. All reconci|liation, but upon the footing of ab&s;olute unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, had been po&s;itively refu&s;ed by Great Bri|tain; unle&s;s, therefore, the colonies had re&s;olved to continue in a loo&s;e and broken &s;tate, with the name of a government which they had taken arms to oppo&s;e, the &s;tep which they have now taken could not have been avoided. Be&s;ides, things had proceeded &s;o far, and &s;uch mea&s;ures had been taken on both &s;ides, that it had become impo&s;&s;ible to lay down a &s;cheme by which <HI>they</HI> &s;hould be &s;ure of our dependance, and <HI>we,</HI> at the &s;ame time, &s;ecured in our liberties. While things continued in their ancient &s;tate, there was perhaps a power on the part of each, of which they were hardly con&s;cious, or were afraid and unwilling to exert. But after the encroachments had been made and re&s;i&s;ted, to expect any thing el&s;e than a conti|nual attempt to extend authority on the one hand, and to guard again&s;t it on the other, is to di&s;cover very little knowledge of human nature. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, though every claim of America &s;hould be yielded, &s;he would &s;oon be either in a &s;tate of con|tinual confu&s;ion, or ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The king of England, living in his Engli&s;h dominions, would not, and indeed dur&s;t not, a&s;&s;ent to any act of an American legi&s;lature, that was, or was &s;uppo&s;ed to be hurtful to his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. This is not found|ed on conjecture, but experience. There is not (at
<PB N="69" REF="015224_0071_0F978B56CB50ED48">
lea&s;t Dean Swift affirms it) any dependence of Ire|land upon England, except an act of the Iri&s;h par|liament, that the king of England &s;hall be king of Ireland. This la&s;t has a &s;eparate independent legi&s;|lature, and in every thing el&s;e but the above circum|&s;tance &s;eems to be perfectly free; yet if any man &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that the one kingdom is not truly &s;ub|ject to the other, he would in my opinion know very little of the &s;tate and hi&s;tory of either.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;tate of independency will be both honourable and profitable to this country. I pa&s;s over many advantages in the way of commerce, as well as in other re&s;pects, that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily accrue from it, that I may dwell a little on the great and leading be|nefit, which is the foundation of all the re&s;t. We &s;hall have the opportunity of forming plans of govern|ment upon the mo&s;t rational, ju&s;t, and equal prin|ciples. I confe&s;s I have always looked upon this with a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;atisfaction. The ca&s;e never happened before &s;ince the world began. All the governments we have read of in former ages were &s;ettled by caprice or accident, by the influence of prevailing parties or particular per&s;ons, or pre|&s;cribed by a conqueror. Important improvements in|deed have been forced upon &s;ome con&s;titutions by the &s;pirit of daring men, &s;upported by &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;ur|rections. But to &s;ee government in large and popu|lous countries &s;ettled from its foundation, by deli|berate coun&s;el, and directed immediately to the pub|lic good of the pre&s;ent and future generations, while the people are waiting for the deci&s;ion with full con|fidence in the wi&s;dom and impartiality of tho&s;e to whom they have committed the important tru&s;t, is cer|tainly altogether new&punc; We learn indeed from hi&s;tory,
<PB N="70" REF="015224_0072_0F978B59DB03EC90">
that &s;mall tribes and feeble new &s;ettlements, did &s;ometimes employ one man of eminent wi&s;dom, to prepare a &s;y&s;tem of laws for them. Even this was a wi&s;e mea&s;ure, and attended with happy ef|fects. But how va&s;t the difference, when we have the experience of all pa&s;t ages, the hi&s;tory of hu|man &s;ociety, and the well known cau&s;es of pro|&s;perity and mi&s;ery in other governments, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the choice.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of this happy circum&s;tance, and the po&s;&s;ibility of lo&s;ing it, and &s;uffering the &s;ea&s;on to pa&s;s over, has filled me with anxiety for &s;ome time. So far as we have hitherto proceeded, there has been great unanimity and public &s;pirit. The inhabitants of every province, and per&s;ons of all de|nominations, have vyed with each other in zeal for the common intere&s;t. But was it not to be feared that &s;ome men would acquire over-bearing influ|ence? that human weakne&s;s and human pa&s;&s;ions would di&s;cover them&s;elves, and prevent the fini&s;h|ing of what had been &s;o happily begun. In the time of the civil wars in England, had they &s;ettled a re|gular form of government a&s;&s;oon as the parliament had obtained an evident &s;uperiority, their liberties would never have been &s;haken, and the revolution would have been unnece&s;&s;ary. But by delaying the thing too long, they were broken into parties and bewildered in their views, and at la&s;t tamely &s;ub|mitted without re&s;i&s;tance to that very tyranny again&s;t which they had fought with &s;o much glory and &s;uc|ce&s;s. For this rea&s;on I think that every candid and liberal mind ought to rejoice in the mea&s;ures lately taken through the States of America, and particu|larly the late Declaration of Independance, as it will
<PB N="71" REF="015224_0073_0F978B5ADF407148">
not only give union and force to the mea&s;ures of defence while they are nece&s;&s;ary, but lay a founda|tion for the birth of millions, and the future im|provement of a great part of the globe.</P>
<P>I have only further to ob&s;erve, 3. That I am confi|dent the Independence of America will, in the end, be to the real advantage of the i&s;land of Great Bri|tain. Were this even otherwi&s;e, it would be a weak argument again&s;t the claim of ju&s;tice. Why &s;hould the &s;ecurity or pro&s;perity of this va&s;t country be &s;acrificed to the &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t of an incon&s;i|derable &s;pot? But I cannot believe that the mi&s;ery and &s;ubjection of any country on earth, is nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of another. Blind partiality and &s;elf intere&s;t may repre&s;ent it in this light; but the opinion is delu&s;ive, the &s;uppo&s;ition is fal&s;e. The &s;ucce&s;s and increa&s;e of one nation is, or may be, a benefit to every other. It is &s;eldom, indeed, that a people in general can receive and adopt the&s;e gene|rous &s;entiments, they are neverthele&s;s perfectly ju&s;t. It is indu&s;try only, and not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that makes the &s;trength and wealth of a nation; and this is not hindered but encouraged, provoked, and rewarded by the indu&s;try of others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See David Hume's E&s;&s;ay on the jealou&s;y of trade.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But to leave the general principle, or rather to apply it to the ca&s;e of Great Britain and America: What profit has the former hitherto received from the latter? and what can it rea&s;onably expect for the future? Only its trade, and &s;uch part of that trade as tends to encourage the indu&s;try and in|crea&s;e the number of the inhabitants of that i&s;land. It will be &s;aid, they intend to rai&s;e a large, clear, net revenue upon us, by taxation. It has been &s;hewn
<PB N="72" REF="015224_0074_0F978B5B566CEFB0">
by many, that all the taxes which they could rai&s;e would only &s;erve to feed the in&s;atiable de&s;ire of wealth in placemen and pen&s;ioners, to increa&s;e the influence of the crown, and the corruption of the people. It was by the acqui&s;ition of numerous provinces that Rome ha&s;tened to its ruin. But even &s;uppo&s;ing it other|wi&s;e, and that without any bad con&s;equence among them&s;elves, they were to acquire a great addition to their yearly revenue, for every &s;hilling they gained by taxes, they would lo&s;e ten in the way of trade. For a trifling addition to the &s;ums of public money to be applied or wa&s;ted by mini&s;ters of &s;tate, they would lo&s;e ten times the quantity di&s;tributed among u&s;eful manufacturers, the &s;trength and glory of a &s;tate. I think this has been &s;ometimes compared to the difference between draughts of &s;pirituous liquors to intoxicate the head or weaken the &s;tomach, and cool refre&s;hing food to give &s;oundne&s;s, health, and vigour to every member of the body.</P>
<P>The trade, then, of America, as &s;oon as peace is &s;ettled, will be as open to them as ever. But it will be &s;aid, they have now an exclu&s;ive trade, they will then but &s;hare it with other nations. I an&s;wer, an exclu&s;ive trade is not ea&s;ily pre&s;erved, and when it is pre&s;erved, the re&s;triction is commonly more hurtful than u&s;eful. Trade is of a nice and delicate nature; it is founded upon intere&s;t. It will force its way wherever intere&s;t leads, and can hardly by any art be made to go in another direction. The Spa|niards have an exclu&s;ive trade, as far as they plea&s;e to confine it, to their own plantations. Do they reap much benefit from it? I believe not. Has it made their own people more indu&s;trious at home? Ju&s;t the contrary. Does it, in the natural cour&s;e
<PB N="73" REF="015224_0075_0F978B5C158AA600">
of things, make a people le&s;s careful to work as well and as cheap as others, to procure voluntary purcha&s;ers, when they know they can &s;end their goods to tho&s;e who are obliged to take them? Does it not both tempt and enable great merchants in the capital, to import from other nations what they can export to &s;uch a forced market, to advantage? By this means a con&s;iderable profit may come into the coffers of a few particulars, while no e&s;&s;ential &s;er|vice is done to the people, and the ultimate profit is carried to that country where the goods are produc|ed or fabricated. It has been repeatedly &s;aid by political writers in England, that the balance of trade is again&s;t that country to every nation, excepting Por|gal and their own plantations. I will not an&s;wer for the truth or univer&s;ality of this a&s;&s;ertion, but if it is true in any mea&s;ure, I will venture to affirm, upon the principles of general rea&s;on, that the cau&s;e which produces it is no other than the exclu&s;ive trade they have hitherto enjoyed to the American &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>But the circum&s;tance which I apprehend will con|tribute mo&s;t to the intere&s;t of Great Britain in Ame|rican Independence is, its influence in peopling and enriching this great continent. It will certainly tend to make the American States numerous, powerful, and opulent, to a degree not ea&s;ily conceived. The great and penetrating Monte&s;quieu, in his Spirit of Laws, has &s;hewn in the cleare&s;t manner, that no|thing contributes &s;o much to the pro&s;perity of a people, as the &s;tate of &s;ociety among them, and the form of their government. A free government overcomes every ob&s;tacle, makes a de&s;art a fruitful field, and fills a bleak and barren country with all
<PB N="74" REF="015224_0076_0F978B5CE2BF5AF0">
the conveniences of life. If &s;o, what mu&s;t be the operation of this powerful cau&s;e upon countries en|joying in the highe&s;t degree every advantage that can be derived from &s;ituation, climate, and &s;oil? If the trade of America has hitherto been of &s;o great benefit to England, how much more valuable may it be when the&s;e countries &s;hall be &s;till more highly improved, if &s;he &s;hall continue to enjoy it? This argument is liable to no objection but what may ari&s;e from the lo&s;s of an exclu&s;ive trade, which I have already con&s;idered. It may be added, how|ever, that there is not now, nor ever has been, any aver&s;ion in the Americans to the people of Great-Britain, &s;o that they may be &s;ure of our trade if they treat us as well as others, and if otherwi&s;e, they do not de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>I might illu&s;trate the argument by &s;tating the pro|bable con&s;equences of a contrary &s;uppo&s;ition. If Great Britain &s;hould prevail, or overcome the Ame|rican States, and e&s;tabli&s;h viceroys with ab&s;olute authority in every province, all men of &s;pirit and lovers of freedom would certainly withdraw them|&s;elves to a corner, if &s;uch could be found, out of the reach of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. The numbers of the people at any rate would &s;en&s;ibly decrea&s;e, their wealth would be &s;peedily exhau&s;ted, and there would remain only a nominal authority over a de&s;o|late country, in return for a va&s;t expence laid out in the conque&s;t, and in place of a great and profi|table trade, by which both nations were made hap|py. One of the arguments, if they may be called &s;o, made u&s;e of again&s;t this country, and on which an obligation to obedience has been founded, is ta|ken from the expence they have been at in blood
<PB N="75" REF="015224_0077_0F978B5D8B5A8268">
and trea&s;ure for our protection in former wars. This argument has been often an&s;wered in the ful|le&s;t manner, but if they &s;hall continue to urge it, how fearful to think of the obligations we &s;hall be under, after this war is fini&s;hed? Then &s;hall we owe them all the &s;ums which they &s;hall have laid out in &s;ubduing us, and all that we have &s;pent in attempt|ing to prevent it; all the blood which they &s;hall have &s;hed in attacking us, and all that we &s;hall have &s;pilt in our own defence. There is unque&s;tionably a lo&s;s to Great Britain by the one &s;ide of the ac|count as well as the other; and it tends to &s;how, in the cleare&s;t manner, the un&s;peakable folly as well as great inju&s;tice of the promoters of this war.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;tated to you, though very briefly, the principles on which I think the American cau&s;e ought to be pleaded, and on which it ought to be e&s;pou&s;ed and &s;upported, by every lover of ju&s;tice and of mankind. But though the general plea in ju&s;tice were le&s;s clear than it is, there is a light in which the conduct of the oppo&s;ers of it has always appeared to me unrea&s;onable and ungene|rous to the highe&s;t degree. That re&s;i&s;tance to Great Britain has been determined on, in the mo&s;t re&s;o|lute manner, through all the colonies, by a va&s;t majority, is not only certain but undeniable. In the beginning of the controver&s;y, &s;ome writers, with an impudence hardly to be paralelled, called the fact in que&s;tion, attempted to deceive the people in this country, and effectually deceived the people of Eng|land, by making them believe that it was only a few factious and violent men that had engaged in the conte&s;t. It is not very long &s;ince a writer had the courage to a&s;&s;ert, that "nine tenths of the people
<PB N="76" REF="015224_0078_0F978B60A06A2050">
of Penn&s;ylvania were again&s;t independence." The fal&s;hood of &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;entations is now manife&s;t, and indeed was probably known from the beginning by tho&s;e who de&s;ired to have them believed. Tak|ing this for granted, then, for an incon&s;iderable minority, whether natives or &s;trangers, to &s;et them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to the public councils, is contrary to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, and even to the very fir&s;t principles of the &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>If there is any principle that was never contro|verted upon the &s;ocial union, it is, that as a body every &s;ociety mu&s;t be determined by the plurality. There was a time when it was not only ju&s;t and con|&s;i&s;tent but nece&s;&s;ary, that every one &s;hould &s;peak his mind freely and fully of the nece&s;&s;ity or expediency of re&s;i&s;ting the authority of Great Britain. But that time is over long ago. The mea&s;ures being re|&s;olved upon, and the conflict begun, one who is bare|ly neuter can &s;carce be forgiven, a &s;ecret plodding enemy mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a traitor. Every per|&s;on who continued among us after the deci&s;ive re&s;o|lutions formed by all the colonies, ought to be con|&s;idered as pledging his faith and honour to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the common cau&s;e. Let me try to illu&s;trate it by a &s;imilar ca&s;e. Suppo&s;e that a &s;hip at &s;ea &s;prings a leak, which expo&s;es the whole company to the mo&s;t imminent danger of peri&s;hing. Suppo&s;e a coun&s;el is called of all the per&s;ons on board to determine what port they &s;hall endeavour to gain. Then it is not only the right but the duty of every one to &s;peak his own judgment, and to pre&s;s it upon others by every argument in his power. Suppo&s;e a great majority determines to pu&s;h for a certain place, and to go to the pump by turns every quarter of an hour; but
<PB N="77" REF="015224_0079_0F978B622CE5CA28">
that two or three or one, if you plea&s;e, is of opini|on that they &s;hould have gone another cour&s;e, be|cau&s;e of the wind, current, or any other circum|&s;tance, and that it would be be&s;t to change hands at the pump only every half hour. All this is well. But if after the determination this &s;ame gentleman, becau&s;e his advice was not followed, &s;hould refu&s;e to pump at all, &s;hould &s;lily alter the &s;hip's cour&s;e, or deaden her way by every means in his power, or even &s;hould only by continual complaints and de&s;|pondent fears di&s;courage others on who&s;e activity the common &s;afety depended, I de&s;ire to know what treatment he would receive or de&s;erve? With|out doubt he would be thrown over board in le&s;s time than I have taken to &s;tate the ca&s;e. I am not able to perceive the lea&s;t difference between this &s;uppo&s;ition and what takes place in America at the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>If this argument is ju&s;t with re&s;pect to every in|habitant of the country, it ought to have &s;ome ad|ditional weight with tho&s;e who are not natives, and who&s;e re&s;idence is not certain or has not been long. There is a great degree of indecency in &s;uch taking any part again&s;t what the majority of the inhabi|tants think to be their intere&s;t and that of their country. Were they even wrong, their mi&s;take &s;hould be lamented, not re&s;i&s;ted; on the contrary, it would be the part both of genero&s;ity and ju&s;tice to &s;upport them effectually in a conte&s;t which wi&s;|dom would have declined. We &s;ee indeed every day melancholy in&s;tances of a ba&s;e and &s;elfi&s;h temper o|perating different ways. Many when they do not ob|tain that rank and honour which their pride and partiality think their due, or if their advice is not
<PB N="78" REF="015224_0080_0F978B6394A1B148">
followed, immediately renounce the &s;ervice of their country, and it may go to de&s;truction for them. In oppo&s;ition to this, let me recommend the example of the illu&s;trious Fabius of Rome. He had given &s;trict orders to all his officers not to en|gage the enemy, but to keep at a di&s;tance. Unluck|ily his lieutenant-general, by his own ra&s;hne&s;s, got entangled with a part of the army under his com|mand, and was engaged. Fabius, preferring his coun|try's good to fame, rival&s;hip, and &s;afety, came im|mediately to his &s;upport with all expedition, and thereby gained a glorious and complete victory.</P>
<P>I hope you will take in good part the above re|flections, which I think contain nothing that is vir|ulent or indecent again&s;t any man or body of men. They are the effects of judgment and conviction. The author, as is probably known to many of you, has been per&s;onally abu&s;ed in news-papers at home for the part he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken in the Ame|rican cau&s;e, which was in &s;ome degree indeed the motive to this addre&s;s. He hopes that an hone&s;t and faithful &s;upport of liberty and equal govern|ment in this part of the world, will be no ju&s;t re|proach to his character, either as a &s;cholar, a mini|&s;ter, or a Chri&s;tian, and that it is perfectly con&s;i&s;t|ent with an undimini&s;hed regard for the country which gave him birth.</P>
