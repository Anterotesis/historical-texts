<HEAD>A VINDICATION of the <HI>Briti&s;h Colonies,</HI> again&s;t the A&s;per&s;ions of the <HI>Halifax</HI> Gentleman, in his Letter to a <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Friend.</HEAD>
<P>IT had been long expected, that &s;ome American pen would be drawn in &s;upport of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which to all thinking men mu&s;t appear to be very extraor|dinary. Tho&s;e who are above party, can peru&s;e the &s;peculations of a Whig or a Tory, a Quaker or a Jacobite, with the &s;ame compo&s;ure of mind. Tho&s;e who confine them&s;elves within the bounds of moderation and decency, are &s;o far re&s;pectable. All who grow outragious, are di&s;|gu&s;tful. The "head of a <HI>tribunitian veto,</HI> with a mob at his heels, and a grand <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> monarque, with a &s;hoal of &s;ychophants clinging about him, like the little wretches in the well known print of Hobb's Laviathan, may be objects of equal diver&s;ion, deri&s;ion and contempt. Mankind ever were, are and will be divi&s;ible, into the great and &s;mall vulgar. Both will have their re&s;pective heads: The laws of nature are uniform and invariable. The &s;ame cau&s;es will produce the &s;ame effects, from generation to genera|tion. He that would be a great captain, mu&s;t for a &s;ea&s;on exult in the honor of being a little one.</P>

<P>The Halifax gentleman having di&s;covered that governor <HI>H&mdash;pk&mdash;ns</HI> is "totally unacquainted with &s;tile and diction," and yet "eagerly fond to pa&s;s upon the world for a man of letters," great perfection might be rea&s;onably expected in the compo&s;ition of the friendly epi&s;tle. In&s;tead of this, are found inaccuracies in abundance, declamation and fal&s;e logic without end; <HI>ver&s;e</HI> is retailed in the &s;hape of <HI>pro&s;e,</HI> &s;oleci&s;ms are attempted to be pa&s;&s;ed off for good grammar,

and the mo&s;t indelicate fu&s;tian for the fine ta&s;te. The whole performance is truly <HI>Filmerian.</HI> The picture is very well charged with &s;hade and thick darkne&s;s, intermixed with here and there a ray of light; now and then a fla&s;h, and once in a while is heard a little rumbling thunder from a few di&s;tant broken clouds.</P>
<L>"Some future bard may &s;ing the pre&s;ent times,</L>
<L>"And HE be made the hero of the &s;ong&punc;</L>
<P>The&s;e two lines are crouded together in one &s;hort &s;en|tence, in a pro&s;aic form. (page 4.)</P>
<P>The gentleman (pag. 5.) has given us a portrait of the Engli&s;h nation. It contains but a dozen lines, and ex|pre&s;&s;es or plainly implies the following wonderful group of ideas, viz. "A high pitch of glory and power, envy and admiration of &s;urrounding &s;laves, holding fa&s;t the balance of Europe, a rival in arts and arms of every period an|cient and modern, impatience, jealou&s;y, pride and folly, prodigality, particularly in laying wagers to the value of kingdoms, and a quick &s;en&s;ibility &amp; con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of dignity, which renders plain &s;imple truth intolerable." As the Eng|li&s;h nation expired about &s;ixty years &s;ince, in the union of the two kingdoms, 'tis needle&s;s to enquire whether this be a ju&s;t character of that once brave and generous, free and loyal people: But if this &s;hould be intended for a filial compliment to Great-Britain, 'tis a very indifferent one. In the late war America joined in the &s;takes: The bet was not for the &s;afety of the colonies alone: It was for the &s;alvation of Great-Britain, as well as the plantations, i. e. for the whole community. Cornwall rai&s;es and pays one company of dragoons, Devon&s;hire another. Is Cornwall more obliged to Devon&s;hire than Devon&s;hire is to Cornwall? They are both obliged by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of duty and loyalty, to the gracious Prince who protects and defends both: To each other they owe, but love and good will.</P>
<P>I cannot think Mr. <HI>H&mdash;k&mdash;s,</HI> or any other of the writers, who have the misfortune to fall under the &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ure of the Halifax gentleman, ever really intended to encou|rage &s;o groundle&s;s a claim as an independent, uncon|troulable Provincial legi&s;lative. Mo&s;t of them 'tis well known expre&s;ly di&s;avow &s;uch a claim. It is certain that the
<PB N="5" REF="010117_0004_0F7CE94E59C74DE0" MS="y">
Parliament of Great-Britain hath a ju&s;t, clear, equitable and con&s;titutional right, power and authority, to bind the colo|nies, by all acts wherein they are named. Every lawyer, nay every Tyro knows this. No le&s;s certain is it that the Parliament of Great-Britain has a ju&s;t and equitable right, power and authority, to <HI>impo&s;e taxes on the colonies, inter|nal and external, on lands, as well as on trade.</HI> This is involved in the idea of a &s;upreme legi&s;lative or &s;overeign power of a &s;tate. It will however by no means from thence follow, that 'tis always expedient, and in all cir|cum&s;tances equitable for the &s;upreme and &s;overeign legi|&s;lative to tax the colonies, much le&s;s that 'tis rea&s;onable this right &s;hould be practi&s;ed upon without allowing the colonies an actual repre&s;entation. An equal repre&s;entation of the whole &s;tate is, at lea&s;t in theory, of the e&s;&s;ence of a per|fect parliament, or &s;upreme legi&s;lative.</P>
<P>There is not the lea&s;t color of a contradiction between the pa&s;&s;ages from the "rights of the colonies" cited pages 6 &amp; 7. It mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;&s;ed and lamented, that the la&s;t citation involves a &s;ophi&s;m, unworthy the pen from whence it fell. But the critic with all his &s;agacity has not pointed where the fallacy lies. He has reduced his Honor's argument to the form of a &s;yllogi&s;m, which is con|clu&s;ive. "The people of Great-Britain have not any &s;ort of power over the Americans;" "The hou&s;e of commons have no greater authority than the people of Great-Britain, who are their con&s;tituents;" "<HI>ergo,</HI> the hou&s;e of commons have not any &s;ort of power over the Americans." This I take to be literally true. Yet by the following reduction, the fallacy of his Honor's argument will appear, "the common people of Great-Britain have no &s;overeign ab&s;olute authority over their fellow &s;ubjects in America;" The hou&s;e of commons alone have no greater authority than the common people of Great-Britain; <HI>ergo,</HI> the Briti&s;h parliament, the King's Maje&s;ty, Lords and Com|mons, have no &s;overeign ab&s;olute authority over the &s;ub|jects in the colonies. Who does not &s;ee the fallacy of this conclu&s;ion? The inquiry was not of the &s;ole &amp; &s;eparate pow|er and authority of the hou&s;e of commons, but of the au|thority of that augu&s;t and tran&s;cendent body the parliament,
<PB N="6" REF="010117_0005_0F7CE94ED851B158">
which is compo&s;ed of the three branches of the grand legi&s;lature of the nation, con&s;idered as united. But all this &s;hows that the la&s;t citation at mo&s;t is but an implicit, and is far from an "expre&s;s, denial of the authority of parlia|ment," and &s;hould by that candor that is in&s;eparable from a liberal mind, have been imputed to meer inadvertency.</P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>rationale</HI> of the epi&s;tle. "I have endeavored (&s;ays the gentleman) to inve&s;tigate the <HI>true, natural relation,</HI> if I <HI>may &s;o &s;peak,</HI> between the colonies and their mother &s;tate, <HI>ab&s;tracted</HI> from <HI>compact,</HI> or <HI>po&s;i|tive In&s;titution.</HI>" What a parade is here? What "a &s;olemnity" does "he give to his performance"? "If I may &s;o &s;peak". Who would not think the world was about to be favored with &s;ome extraordinary di&s;covery, too mighty for the powers and preci&s;ion of language.</P>
<P>Let us attend the cour&s;e of the bubble. "But here" (adds he) "I can find nothing &s;atisfactory: Yet till this <HI>relation</HI> is clearly defined upon <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>natural princi|ples,</HI> our <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> upon the <HI>mea&s;ures</HI> of the colonies obe|dience, will be <HI>de&s;ultory</HI> and inconclu&s;ive." "Every con|nection or relation in life has its reciprocal duties; we know the relation between a parent and a child, husband and wife, ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, and from thence are able to deduce their re&s;pective obligations". "But we have no notices of any <HI>&s;uch</HI> preci&s;e natural relation between a <HI>mother &s;tate</HI> and its colonies, and therefore cannot rea&s;on with &s;o much certainty upon the <HI>power</HI> of the one or the <HI>duties</HI> of the other." If, as the gentleman tells us, he could not find any thing &s;atisfactory, he could only gue&s;s what rea|&s;oning would follow: And I leave it to his readers to de|termine, whether he has not proved that he gue&s;&s;ed very rightly. He has placed the relation of ma&s;ter and &s;ervant among what he calls natural relations. In a &s;tate of nature, where all are equal, I believe the gentleman would be as much puzzled to find his ma&s;ter or &s;ervant, as others now may be to find his equal. 'Tis a little &s;trange he &s;hould attempt to rea&s;on on a &s;ubject, of which, he confe&s;&s;es, he could find no "&s;atisfactory notices." But he &s;eems de|termined to flounder on thro' thick and thin, be his rea&s;on|ings "de&s;ultory" or conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010117_0006_0F7CE94FB2BA38A8" MS="y">"The ancients (&s;ays he) have <HI>tran&s;mitted</HI> (for handed down; 'tis a wonder it had not been <HI>tran&s;ported</HI>) to us nothing that is applicable to the &s;tate of the modern colo|nies, becau&s;e the <HI>relation</HI> between the&s;e (and their mother &s;tate &s;hould have been added) is formed by <HI>political com|pact. Brave!</HI> "And the <HI>condition</HI> of each variant in their original and from each other." Better and better &s;till! If <HI>condition</HI> means the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and I think it can mean nothing el&s;e, what a delectable piece of jargon does the clo&s;e of this period make. It amounts to this. "The pre&s;ent &s;tate of each modern colony is variant in its original, and from each other." Be this as it may; if the <HI>relation</HI> of modern colonies to their mother &s;tates, is founded on <HI>political compact,</HI> how came the gentleman to beat his brains to find out "their <HI>natural relation ab&s;tracted from compact or po&s;itive in&s;titution?</HI>" To what purpo&s;e he has done this he tells us when he confe&s;&s;es he can find nothing "<HI>&s;atisfactory</HI>" about it. Are not <HI>natural</HI> and meerly <HI>political</HI> or <HI>civil relations</HI> different things? Is it not a little jargonical and incon&s;i&s;tent, in one breath to talk of "in|ve&s;tigating the <HI>true, natural, clearly defined</HI> relation of the colonies to their mother &s;tate, ab&s;tracted from compact or po&s;itive in&s;titution"; and in the next to affirm that &s;o far as relates to modern colonies, this relation depends, or "is founded on political compact"? Was there a natural relation between ancient &s;tates and their colonies, and none between the modern &s;tates and their colonies? Is not a "political compact," the &s;ame thing with a "po&s;itive in&s;titution." Is this "freeing a &s;ubject from embarra&s;&s;ment"? Well might the gentleman "&s;hun the walk of metaphy&s;ics"? I wi&s;h he had not &s;o much avoided that of logic. He every where &s;eems to con&s;ider <HI>power</HI> and <HI>duty</HI> as corre|lates. Surely he &s;hould be the la&s;t man to charge his adver&s;ary with "vague and diffu&s;e (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">) talk of" tho&s;e levelling notions "rights and privileges." He be|wilders him&s;elf for half a poor creeping page more, ab|ruptly &s;ings a <HI>requiem</HI> to his &s;weet &s;oul, compo&s;es the &s;urges of his "philo&s;ophically inqui&s;itive mind" fatigued with its late flight after natural and political relations, and very gravely contents him&s;elf with con&s;idering the "colo|nies
<PB N="8" REF="010117_0007_0F7CE95008F8BCD8">
rights upon the footing of their charters." This foot|hold, by a new and bold figure in rhetoric, he calls "the only plain avenues that lead to the truth of this matter."</P>
<L>&mdash; "facilis de&s;cen&s;us Averni:"</L>
<P>The gentleman is at a lo&s;s (page 8.) to "conceive how it comes to pa&s;s that the colonies now claim <HI>any other or greater</HI> rights than are expre&s;ly granted to them" by char|ter. Is the gentleman a Briti&s;h-born &s;ubject and a lawyer, and ignorant that charters from the crown have u&s;ually been given for enlarging the liberties and privileges of the gran|tees, not for limiting them, much le&s;s for curtailing tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential rights which all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects are entitled to, by the laws of God and nature, as well as by the com|mon law, and by the con&s;titution of their country?</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction (page 8.) between per&s;onal and political rights, is a new invention, and, as applied, has perplexed the author of it. He every where confounds the terms rights, liberties and privileges, which in legal as well as vul|gar acceptation, denote very different ideas. This is a common mi&s;take with tho&s;e who cannot &s;ee any difference between power &amp; right, between a blind &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and a loyal generous and rational obedience, to the &s;upreme authority of a &s;tate.</P>
<P>The rights of men are, <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>civil.</HI> Both the&s;e are divi&s;ible into <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>relative.</HI> The natural ab&s;olute per&s;onal rights of individuals, are &s;o far from being oppo&s;ed to political or civil rights, that they are the very ba&s;is of all municipal laws of any great value. "The ab&s;olute rights of individuals regarded by the municipal laws, compo&s;e what is called <HI>political</HI> or <HI>civil liberty.</HI>" "The ab&s;olute liberties of Engli&s;hmen, as frequently declared in parliament, are principally three. 1. The right of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> &s;ecurity, per|&s;onal <HI>liberty,</HI> and private property." "Be&s;ides the&s;e three <HI>primary rights,</HI> there are others which are <HI>&s;econdary</HI> and <HI>&s;ubordinate,</HI> (to pre&s;erve the former from unlawful attacks) 1. The con&s;titution or power of parliament. 2. The li|mitation of the King's prerogative (and to vindicate them when actually violated). 3. The regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. 4. The right of petitioning for redre&s;s of grievan|ce&s;s. 5. The right of having and u&s;ing arms for &s;elf-de|fence."
<PB N="9" REF="010117_0008_0F7CE950B8EDE9E0">
See Mr. Black&s;tone's accurate and elegant analy&s;is of the laws of England. The gentleman &s;eems to have taken this and &s;ome other of his di&s;tinctions from that excel|lent treati&s;e very ill under&s;tood. The analy&s;is had given this general view of the <HI>objects</HI> of the laws of England. I. Rights of Per&s;ons. II. Rights of Things. III. Private wrongs. IV. Public wrongs. Rights of per&s;ons are divided into the&s;e, 1. of natural per&s;ons; 2. of bodies politic or corporate, i. e. artificial per&s;ons, or &s;ubor|dinate &s;ocieties. The rights of the&s;e are by the Letter-writer &s;trangely confounded with the political &amp; civil rights of natural per&s;ons. And becau&s;e corporate rights &s;o far as they depend upon charter, are matters of the meer favor and grace of the donor or founder; he thence infers (p. 9.) That "the colonies have no rights independent of their charters," and that "they can claim no greater than tho&s;e give them." This is a contradiction to what he admit|ted in the preceding page, viz. That "by the common law every coloni&s;t hath a right to his life, liberty and property." And he was &s;o vulgar as to call the&s;e the "&s;ubjects birth-right." But what is this birth-right worth, if it depends meer|ly upon a colony charter, that, as he &s;ays, rightly eno', may be taken away by the parliament? I wi&s;h the gentleman would an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions. Would he think an e&s;tate worth much, that might be taken from him at the plea&s;ure of another? Are charters from the crown u&s;ually given for enlarging the liberties and privileges of the grantees in con|&s;ideration of &s;ome &s;pecial merit and &s;ervices done the &s;tate, or would he have his readers con&s;ider them like the ordi|nances of a French monarque, for limiting and curtailing tho&s;e rights which all Britons, and all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are in|tituled to by the laws of God and nature, as well as by the common law and the con&s;titution of their country, &s;o admi|rably built on the principles of the former? By which of the&s;e laws, in contradi&s;tinction to the other, are the rights of life, liberty, and e&s;tate, per&s;onal?</P>
<P>The gentleman's po&s;itions and principles, that "the &s;e|veral New-England charters a&s;certain, define and limit the re&s;pective <HI>rights</HI> and privileges of each colony," and that "the colonies have no rights independent of their charter,"
<PB N="10" REF="010117_0009_0F7CE951F73AFE08">
and that "they can claim no greater than tho&s;e give them," if true, would afford a curious train of con&s;equences. Life liberty and property, are by the law of nature, as well as by the common law, &s;ecured to the happy inhabitants of South-Britain, and con&s;titute their <HI>primary</HI> civil or political rights. But in the colonies, the&s;e and all other rights, ac|cording to our author, depend upon charter. Therefore tho&s;e of the colonies who have no charter, have no right to life, liberty or property. And in tho&s;e colonies who have charters, the&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings depend on the meer good <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">l, grace and plea&s;ure of the &s;upreme power, and all their charters, and of cour&s;e all their rights, even to life, liberty and property, may be taken away at plea&s;ure. Thus every charter in England may be taken away; for they are but voluntary and gracious grants of the crown, of certain li|mitted, local, political privileges, &s;uperadded to tho&s;e of the common law. But would it be expedient to &s;trike &s;uch a blow, without the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity? "In all &s;tates there is (and mu&s;t be) an ab&s;olute &s;upreme power, to which the right of <HI>legi&s;lation</HI> belongs: and which by the &s;ingular con&s;titution of the&s;e kingdoms is ve&s;ted in the King, Lords, and Commons."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone.</NOTE> Now Magna Charta is but a law of their making, and they may alter it at plea&s;ure; but does it thence follow, that it would be expedient to repeal every &s;tatute from William the conqueror, to this time? But by the gen|tleman's principles, this may be done wantonly, and with|out any rea&s;on at all. Further, by his logic the parliament may make the monarchy ab&s;olute, or reduce it to a republic; both which would be contrary to the tru&s;t re|repo&s;ed in them by the con&s;titution&punc; which is to pre&s;erve, not de&s;troy it; and to this, all are &s;worn, from the King's Maje&s;ty in his coronation oath, to the meane&s;t &s;ubject in the oath of allegiance. Into &s;uch ab&s;urd and trea&s;onable doc|trines mu&s;t the gentleman run, in order to be con&s;i&s;tent. Nay, all the vagaries of Filmer, Mannwaring and Sib|thorp, and of the whole tribe of King Adam's &s;ubjects will follow. As 1. That Adam was the fir&s;t monarch of this earth. No Prince has a title to his crown but he who can prove him&s;elf to be the elde&s;t heir male of the
<PB N="11" REF="010117_0010_0F7CE952676290B8">
body of Adam. That all other Princes are u&s;urpers and tyrants. That according to Filmer, God hath given to every father over his children, and much more to every Prince over his &s;ubjects, a power "ab&s;olute, arbitrary and unlimited, and unlimitable over the lives, liberties &amp; e&s;tates of &s;uch children &amp; &s;ubjects; &s;o that they may take or alienate their e&s;tates, &s;ell, ca&s;trate or u&s;e their per&s;ons as he plea&s;es, they being all his &s;laves, and the father or prince, lord proprietor of every thing, and his unbounded will their law." This is the &s;ub&s;tance of one of Mr. Locke's in|ferences from the&s;e words of Filmer; "God hath given to the father a right or liberty to alien his power over his children, to any other; whence we find the &s;ale and gift of children to have been much in u&s;e in the beginning of the world, when men had their &s;ervants for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and inheritance, as well as other goods (and chattels); where|upon we find the power of <HI>ca&s;trating,</HI> and making eunuchs (for &s;inging &s;ongs like Lillibullero, &amp;c.) much in u&s;e in old times." Ob&s;. 155. "Law is nothing el&s;e, but the will of him that hath the power of the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> father." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;erv. p. 225.</NOTE> Horrid bla&s;phemy! The Lord omnipotent reigneth, but to whom hath he committed his &s;upreme power and autho|rity? The Pope claims to be but Lord Lieutenant of Heaven, and before Sir Robert, none but the Devil ever had vanity or folly enough to contend for the whole power of the &s;upreme father. According to Filmer, and his followers, among which the Halifax gentleman is a clo&s;e imitator; "they that &s;hed innocent blood, even the blood of their &s;ons &amp; their daughters&punc; whom they &s;acrificed unto the idols of Canaan", did no more than they had a right to do. Upon &s;uch principles Pharoah was a pious virtuous Prince. And the drowning the infants in the Nile, was as ju&s;tifiable a piece of preventive policy as &s;eizing the &s;hips of the French without a declaration of war. The Phili&s;tine rulers too acted very commendably in depriving the Hebrews of the u&s;e of iron, it being very certain that any the mo&s;t polite people without the free u&s;e of this invaluable metal, would in one century return to the &s;avage &s;tate of the Indians.

Mr. Locke be the rule of what ought to be, hi&s;tory would have furni&s;hed our author with in&s;tances of this ab&s;olute fatherly power, in its height and perfection, and he might have &s;hew'd us in Peru, people that begot children, on purpo&s;e to fatten and eat them." Mr. Locke has recited a &s;tory of this kind, &s;o horrid, that I would for the honor of the human &s;pecies think it incredible, and but the meer flight of imagination in <HI>Gracila&s;&s;o de Vega</HI>; like Swift's propo&s;al to the people of Ireland, to fatten their children for &s;ale in Leaden Hall-market, as almo&s;t the only branch of commerce that would give no offence to the good people of England. See the &s;tory cited by Mr. Locke in his treati&s;e on government, Cap. II. &amp; VI. The Filmeri|ans often preach the principles of anarchy in one breath, and tho&s;e of de&s;poti&s;m in another. The gentleman (page 9.) &s;ays, "The individuals of the coloni&s;ts participate of every ble&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h con&s;titution can give them." "As corporations created by the crown, they are confined within the primitive views of their in&s;titution." "Whe|ther therefore their <HI>indulgence</HI> is <HI>liberal</HI> or <HI>&s;canty,</HI> can be no cau&s;e of complaint; for when they accepted of their char|ters, they <HI>tacitly</HI> &s;ubmitted to the terms and conditions of them." This is admirable! To be &s;ure a liberal indul|gence could be no cau&s;e of complaint. I have heard of a &s;canty allowance, and it often happens in a tran&s;portation a-cro&s;s the atlantic: but what is a <HI>&s;canty indulgence?</HI> I am in doubt under what &s;pecies of Helleni&s;m to rank it. Is it Doric or Ionic? Attic I am &s;ure it is not. But at pre&s;ent I am content it &s;hould pa&s;s as very good Engli&s;h, for a poor pittance of bread, water, &s;tinking beef and coar&s;e cloaths, in&s;tead of the roa&s;t beef of old England, prai&s;ed and &s;ung by &s;uch authors as delight in compo&s;itions like Lillibullero. Has a &s;ervant no rea&s;on to complain that his allowance is &s;canty, that he is half naked, and more than half &s;tarved, while his le&s;s faithful and le&s;s loyal fellow-&s;ervant is well fed, plump, gay, and cloathed in purple &amp; &s;carlet &amp; fine linnen, faring &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, upon the &s;poils of his neighbour?

cannot for the heart of me conceive how he "participates of every ble&s;&s;ing" of his fellow &s;ervant; unle&s;s the gen|tleman will contend that half a loaf is equal to a whole one, and that <HI>Martyn</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI> were really a couple of &s;coundrels, for denying that the cru&s;ts Lord Peter would have palm'd upon them" were very good Ham&s;tead-down mutton. That "the coloni&s;ts do not hold their rights as a privilege granted them, nor enjoy them as a grace and favour be&s;towed, but po&s;&s;e&s;s them as an inherent indefea&s;ible right" as Mr. H&mdash;k&mdash;s very ju&s;tly a&s;&s;erts, is a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, to every one in the lea&s;t ver&s;ed in the laws of nature and nations, or but moderately &s;killed in the common law, except the learned gentleman of Ha|lifax. Even the King's writs are divided into tho&s;e which the &s;ubject hath a right to, <HI>ex debito ju&s;titiae,</HI> and tho&s;e which depend upon meer grace and favor. The&s;e may be denied, the others cannot.

<P>What the gentleman adds, viz. "that this po&s;tulatum of Mr. H&mdash;pk&mdash;s cannot be true, with regard to political rights," by which he evidently means the peculiar privileges of &s;ub|ordinate powers granted by charter, is (a&s;king his pardon) meer impertinence, and in a gentleman of his &s;en&s;e, could ari&s;e only from a certain &s;ett of prejudices, having &s;o far blinded him as to make him confound the ideas of cor|porate &s;ubordinate privileges, with e&s;&s;ential, natural and ci|vil rights, as is above mo&s;t abundantly demon&s;trated, and clearly appears from his own words. (page 10.) "The force of an act of parliament, over the colonies, is <HI>predi|cated</HI> upon the common law, the origin and ba&s;is of all tho&s;e inherent <HI>rights</HI> &amp; <HI>privileges</HI> which con&s;titute the boa&s;t and felicity of a Briton". I wi&s;h he had &s;aid the ju&s;tly boa&s;ted felicity of a Briton; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e, I &s;hould not have &s;u&s;pected him of a Filmerian &s;neer in this place, which jealou&s;y his dogmas el&s;ewhere will ju&s;tify. The inherent, indefea&s;ible rights of the &s;ubject, &s;o much derided and de&s;pi&s;ed in other parts of the performance, are here admitted, in je&s;t or in earne&s;t: I care not which. The
<PB N="14" REF="010117_0013_0F7CE956F20EBA50" MS="y">
origin of tho&s;e rights is in the law of nature and its author. This law is the grand ba&s;is of the common law, and of all other municipal laws that are worth a ru&s;h. True it is, that every act of parliament, which names the colonies, or de&s;cribes them as by the words "plantations or dominions" binds them. But this is not &s;o &s;trictly and properly &s;peak|ing by the common law, as by the law of nature, and by the con&s;titution of a parliament, or &s;overeign and &s;upreme legi&s;lative, in a &s;tate. 'Tis as true, that when the colo|nies are not named or de&s;cribed by an act of parliament, they are not bound by it.</P>
<P>What is the rea&s;on of all this? <HI>Qui haeret in liter<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> hae+ret in cortice.</HI> Surely the bare naming of the colonies hath no magical charm or force in it. That the colonies &s;hould be bound by acts of parliament wherein they are named, is an exception from a general rule or maxim. What is that rule or maxim? It is that the colonies being &s;eparate do|minions, and at a di&s;tance from the realm, or mother &s;tate, and in fact unrepre&s;ented in parliament, &s;hall be governed by laws of their own making; and unle&s;s named in acts of parliament, &s;hall not be bound by them. <HI>Quia non mit|tunt milites ad parliamentum,</HI> &s;ays Lord Coke. Yet as a mark of, and to pre&s;erve their dependency on, and &s;ubor|dination to, the mother &s;tate, and to prevent <HI>imperium in imperio,</HI> the greate&s;t of all political &s;olici&s;ms, the mother &s;tate ju&s;tly a&s;&s;erts the right and authority to bind her colo|nies, where &s;he really thinks the good of the whole requires it; and of this &s;he remains the &s;upreme judge, from who&s;e final determination there is no appeal. The mother &s;tate hath al&s;o an undoubted right to unite a colony to it&s;elf, and wholly to abrogate and annihilate all colony or &s;ubordiate legi&s;lation and admini&s;tration, if &s;uch alteration &s;hall appear for the be&s;t intere&s;t of the whole community. But &s;hould this be done needle&s;ly and wantonly, and without allowing the colonies a repre&s;entation, the exerci&s;e of the power that would otherwi&s;e be ju&s;t and equitable, would cea&s;e to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e amiable qualities. Should a mother &s;tate even think it rea&s;onable to impo&s;e internal, as well as external taxes, on &s;ix millions of &s;ubjects in their remote dominions, without allowing them one voice, it would be
<PB N="15" REF="010117_0014_0F7CE957CB090708" MS="y">
matter of wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment: But it could not be &s;aid that the &s;upreme legi&s;lative had exceeded the bounds of their power and authority; nor would this render a petition undutiful and &s;editious. Tho&s;e &s;ix millions mu&s;t on &s;uch an event, unle&s;s blind, &s;ee them&s;elves reduced to the mortifying condition of meer cyphers and blanks in &s;ociety. Should all this ever happen to the Briti&s;h colonies, which God forbid, might it not be truly and &s;afely affirmed that the repre&s;entation in the hou&s;e of Commons would be very unequal? The right of a &s;upreme power in a &s;tate to tax its colonies, is a thing that is clear and evident; and yet the mode of exerci&s;ing that right may be que&s;tionable, in point of rea&s;on and equity. It may be tho't to be unequal and contrary to &s;ound policy, to exerci&s;e the right, clear as it is, without allowing a repre&s;entation to the colonies. And tho' a repre&s;entation would avail the colonies very little in this generation; yet to po&s;terity, it might be an invaluable ble&s;&s;ing. It may al&s;o in future ages, be very beneficial to Great-Britain. Is it to be believed, that when a continent of 3000 miles in length, &s;hall have more inhabitants than there are at this day in Great-Britain, France and Ireland, perhaps in all Europe; they will be quite content with the bare name of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and to the end of time, &s;upinely acquie&s;ce in laws made, as it may happen, again&s;t their intere&s;t, by an a&s;&s;embly 3000 miles beyond &s;ea, and where, &s;hould they agree in the &s;entiments with the Halifax gentleman, it may be tho't that an admi&s;&s;ion of an American member, would "fully and defile the purity of the whole body?" One hundred years will give this continent more inhabitants, than there are in the three kingdoms.</P>
<P>Many great and good men have complained of the ine|quality of the repre&s;entation in Great-Britain. This ine|quality can never be a rea&s;on for making it more &s;o; which however is the method of rea&s;oning adopted by the Halifax gentleman. At his rate, it would be ju&s;t that half the coun|ties and boroughs in Great-Britain, which now return mem|bers, &s;hould be curtailed of their right. If &s;o, why not half the remainder, and &s;o on 'till the hou&s;e of commons will be reduced to a &s;ingle member; and when he was
<PB N="16" REF="010117_0015_0F7CE95843B2B378">
&s;plit, one branch of the legi&s;lature would be annihilated. By a like proce&s;s, the hou&s;e of Lords, the &s;econd branch of the legi&s;lature, might be de&s;troyed. This would be a &s;horter cut to ab&s;olute and unlimited monarchy, than ever Filmer was fortunate enough to invent. This brings us to the con&s;ideration of the Maxim, that "no Engli&s;hman can be taxed but by his own con&s;ent, in per&s;on or by his repre&s;entative". "This dry maxim, taken in a literal &s;en&s;e, and little under&s;tood <HI>like</HI> the &s;ong of <HI>Lillibullero,</HI> has made all the mi&s;chief in the colonies," &s;ays the gentleman; (page 11.). I cannot conceive how this, or any other dry maxim, or the &s;ong of Lillibullero like it, well or ill un|der&s;tood, can make any mi&s;chief in the colonies. What notable harm has the &s;ong of Lillibullero wrought in the colonies, or what like it has this "dry maxim" effected? "It is (&s;ays the gentleman, page 11.) the opinion of the hou&s;e of commons, and <HI>may</HI> be con&s;idered as a law of parliament, that they are the Repre&s;entatives of every Briti&s;h &s;ubject where&s;oever he be." <HI>Fe&s;tina lente domine!</HI> This may be true in one &s;en&s;e. The &s;upreme legi&s;lative indeed repre&s;ents the whole &s;ociety or community, as well the dominions as the realm; and this is the true rea&s;on why the dominions are ju&s;tly bound by &s;uch acts of parliament as name them. This is implied in the idea of a &s;upreme &s;overeign power; and if the parliament had not &s;uch au|thority, the colonies would be independent, which none but rebels, fools or madmen will contend for. God for|bid the&s;e colonies &s;hould ever prove undutiful to their mother country! Whenever &s;uch a day &s;hall come, it will be the beginning of a terrible &s;cene. Were the&s;e colonies left to them&s;elves, to-morrow, America would be a meer &s;hambles of blood and confu&s;ion, before little petty &s;tates could be &s;ettled. How many millions mu&s;t peri&s;h in build|ing up great empires? How many more mu&s;t be ruined by their fall? Let any man reflect on the revolutions of government, ancient and modern and he will think him|&s;elf happy in being born here in the infancy of the&s;e &s;et|tlements, and from his &s;oul deprecate their once entertain|ing any &s;entiments but tho&s;e of loyalty, patience, meekne&s;s and forbearance, under any hard&s;hips that in the cour&s;e of

time they may be &s;ubjected to. The&s;e, as far as may be con&s;i&s;tent with the character of men and chri&s;tians, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to. If it is the opinion of the pre&s;ent honorable hou&s;e of commons, that they in <HI>fact repre&s;ent</HI> the colonies, it is more than I know. Should this be their opinion, the gentleman may if he plea&s;es, "con&s;ider it as a law of parliament": But I &s;hould rather chu&s;e to con&s;ider it only as the very re&s;pectable opinion of one branch of the &s;upreme legi&s;lative. The opinion of the hou&s;e of Lords, and then above all the &s;anction of the King's Maje&s;ty mu&s;t be &s;uperadded, and the concurrence of both is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make any opinion of the hou&s;e of commons an act or law of <HI>parliament.</HI> 'Tis humbly conceived, that it was not as repre&s;entatives in <HI>fact</HI> of the colonies, that the hou&s;e of commons granted his Maje&s;ty an exter|nal tax on the colonies, in the in&s;tance of the late act. Nor if before this time an act for granting internal taxes on the colonies &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed, could I conceive that the hou&s;e of commons are our repre&s;entatives in fact. As one branch of the &s;upreme legi&s;lative they have an un|doubted right to originate any bills that by naming them &s;hall bind the colonies when pa&s;&s;ed into an act; let it be for levying internal or external taxes, or for any other re|gulation that may appear needful. But I cannot find it affirmed or declared in one act of parliament, hi&s;tory or journal of parliamentary proceedings, nor in one Engli&s;h law book, that a Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons are in <HI>fact</HI> the repre&s;entatives of all the plebeian &s;ubjects, without as well as within the <HI>realm.</HI> Lord Coke indeed &s;ays, that "the hou&s;e of commons repre&s;ent all the commons of <HI>England,</HI> electors and non-electors"; but he no where a&s;&s;erts that the hou&s;e of commons in <HI>fact</HI> repre&s;ent the provincials of Ireland and other dominions out of the <HI>realm.</HI> He &s;ays, however, the people of Ireland are not repre&s;ented in the Engli&s;h parliament, and a&s;&s;igns that as the very rea&s;on why, in general, acts of parliament are confined to the realm. Though from the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing, in &s;everal ca&s;es, by naming them, the provinces are bound.

<P>Here is not one word of the hou&s;e of commons repre|&s;enting or being tru&s;ted by or for, the provincials of Ire|land, or the coloni&s;ts in America.

In e&s;timation of law they are ju&s;tly deemed as repre&s;ented. They have all fathers, brothers, friends or neighbours in the hou&s;e of commons, and many <HI>ladies</HI> have husbands there.

to mo&s;t of them, as the &s;avages in <HI>Calafornia.</HI> But according to our letter writer, we are not only in <HI>law</HI> but in <HI>deed</HI> repre&s;ented in the hou&s;e of commons. How does he &s;upport this? Why he has dreamt, that &s;ome one hou&s;e of commons in &s;ome former reign, once tho't they were <HI>in fact</HI> our repre&s;entatives. That "the opinion of a hou&s;e of commons is a law of parliament": Therefore "tis determined by act of parliament, that we are, and &s;hall believe we are in <HI>fact</HI> repre&s;ented in the hou&s;e of com|mons." Here's more logic. Suppo&s;e &s;ome future hou&s;e of commons &s;hould be of opinion, that they were the true and proper repre&s;entatives of all the common people upon the globe, would that make them &s;o, and oblige all mankind to believe and &s;ubmit to it? Would a fiction of the common law of England &s;atisfy the innumerable multitudes on the face of the whole earth, that they were in <HI>fact</HI> repre&s;ented, and con&s;enting to all &s;uch taxes and tributes as might be demanded of them? Will any man's calling him&s;elf my agent, repre&s;entative or tru&s;tee, make him &s;o in fact? At this rate a hou&s;e of commons in one of the colonies have but to conceive an opinion that they repre|&s;ent all the common people of Great-Britain, and ac|cording to our author they would in <HI>fact</HI> repre&s;ent them, and have a right to tax them. 'Tis &s;trange the gentle|man can &s;ee no difference between a literal &s;en&s;e of a fundamental principle or "dry maxim" as he calls it, and no &s;en&s;e at all. Does it follow, becau&s;e it is "im|practicable that each individual &s;hould be in <HI>fact</HI> repre|&s;ented," that therefore there &s;hould be no repre&s;entation at all, or a very unequal one? Becau&s;e the little in&s;igni|ficant i&s;les of Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey and Man, have never ob|tained a repre&s;entation, is it rea&s;onable that the whole kingdom of Ireland and the Plantations &s;hould be forever excluded from returning members to the Briti&s;h parliament, even &s;hould the parliament impo&s;e external and internal taxes on them, and take from them every &s;ubordinate power of local legi&s;lation? If this would be equal and ra|tional, why might not Wales have been excluded from returning members, why may they not be excluded now, and Devon&s;hire and Cornwall, and every other County and
<PB N="20" REF="010117_0019_0F7CE95B59C59090">
borough &s;hare the &s;ame fate? Matter of fact is one thing, matter of right another. The people of a &s;tate may in <HI>fact</HI> be very unequally repre&s;ented; but few men would like our author in effect contend that it were be&s;t they &s;hould not be repre&s;ented at all. Has the gentleman for|got the maxim, "that equity is equality." 'Tis hoped he will not con&s;ider this as a levelling principle, as it has been more than once called. How a&s;toni&s;hing is it, that the in&s;tances (page 12.) of the unequal repre&s;entation in Great-Britain, to which he might have added, tho&s;e of "ten Corni&s;h barns, and an ale hou&s;e" &s;hould be brought as an argument to prove that "the right of being re|pre&s;ented in parliament" is "an <HI>utopian privilege</HI>" a "phantom" a "cloud in the &s;hape of Juno"?&mdash;This is far from a fine compliment to the honorable hou&s;e of commons, of which as one of the branches of the &s;u|preme legi&s;lative, and of the privilege of &s;itting with them, it would have been more decent to have made a different choice of expre&s;&s;ions. To atone for this inde|licacy, the next moment the pendulum vibrates as far the other way.</P>
<P>In page 13, The parliament is repre&s;ented as &s;o pure and perfect, that "<HI>the beauty and &s;ymmetry of this body would be de&s;troyed, and its purity defiled, by the un|natural mixture of repre&s;entatives from</HI> every part of the Briti&s;h dominions." "Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and the dwellers of Me&s;opotamia, &amp;c. <HI>would not in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;peak the &s;ame language</HI>". "What a heterogenous council would this form"? "What a mon&s;ter in govern|ment would it be"? Let me add, was ever in&s;olence equal to this? Are the inhabitants of Briti&s;h America all a parcel of tran&s;ported thieves, robbers and rebels, or de&s;cended from &s;uch? Are the coloni&s;ts bla&s;ted lepers, who&s;e company would infect the whole hou&s;e of com|mons? There are &s;ome in the colonies who value them|&s;elves on their de&s;cent.

as members without breading a plague in the hou&s;e. If this writer is an european, his in&s;ults upon the Briti&s;h colonies are quite unpardonable; if he be a native, he is an ungrateful parricide. Is he a venal hireling of a party, his employers on either &s;ide the atlantic &s;hould di&s;card him as a meer Sir Martyn Marplot? Depend upon it, one &s;uch letter as his, if known to breath the &s;entiments of the great, would tend more to di&s;gu&s;t the colonies again&s;t the conduct of their &s;uperiors, than a hundred thou&s;and &s;uch pamphlets as the author &s;colds at. Parliaments are not only "as ancient as our Saxon ance&s;tors" but as old as the common wealth's of I&s;rael, Greece and Rome <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">4 In&s;t. 2.3.</NOTE>; nay as old as the fir&s;t compact for changing a &s;imple democracy into any other form of government. "Attendance in parliament" is not therefore, as the gentleman conceives, a "duty ari&s;ing from a tenure of lands or the feudal &s;y&s;tem" but from the nature of man, of &s;ociety, and of all original, ju&s;t, &s;ocial and civil compacts for forming a &s;tate. "So that the privilege of &s;itting in it, i. e. in a parliament or grand council of a nation, is not "territorial" in the &s;en&s;e of the letter writer, nor in its nature confined to Great-Britain". What is there, what can there be, that &s;hould naturally and nece&s;&s;arily confine the privilege of returning members, to the inhabitants of Great-Britain, more than to tho&s;e of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter?</P>
<P>The gentleman (p. 14.) &s;ays, "the parliament may levy internal taxes, as well as regulate trade, there is no e&s;&s;ential difference." By regulating trade, I &s;uppo&s;e he means, ac|cording to the common &s;ophi&s;m, taxing trade. Even in this &s;en&s;e, 'tis admitted the parliament have the &s;ame right to levy internal taxes on the colonies, as to regulate trade; and that the right of levying both, is undoubtedly in the parliament. Yet 'tis humbly conceived and hoped, that before the authority is fully exerted in either ca&s;e, it will be tho't to be but rea&s;onable and equitable, that the domi|nions &s;hould be in <HI>fact</HI> repre&s;ented. El&s;e it will follow, that the provincials in Europe, A&s;ia, Africa and America, ought to all generations to content them&s;elves with having no more &s;hare, weight or influence, even in the provincial govern|ment
<PB N="22" REF="010117_0021_0F7CE95F50A1E770">
of their re&s;pective countries, than the Hotentots have in that of China, or the Ethiopians in that of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know how the gentleman came by his a&s;&s;urance, that "a &s;tamp-duty is confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t rea&s;onable and equitable that can be devi&s;ed." (ibid.) Some few may be of this opinion, and there never was a new in|vented tax or exci&s;e, but its favorors and partizans would highly extol, as the mo&s;t ju&s;t and equitable device imagina|ble. This is a trite game "at ways and means". But bold a&s;&s;ertions will not pa&s;s for clear proofs, with "philo&s;ophi|cally inqui&s;itive minds." "If the &s;haft is &s;ped," and the aim &s;o good, I wonder the gentleman &s;hould even faintly pretend to "de&s;ire not to &s;ee a &s;tamp-duty e&s;tabli&s;hed a|mong us," or "wi&s;h to prevent the blow." Were I con|vinced, as he is, that it is rea&s;onable and be&s;t that the colo|nies &s;hould be taxed by parliament, without being allowed a repre&s;entation; and that it is become not only nece&s;&s;ary to levy internal taxes on them; but that the art of man could not devi&s;e &s;o equitable and rea&s;onable a tax as a &s;tamp duty; I &s;hould heartily pray for its e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The gentleman no where di&s;covers his temper more plainly than in his compari&s;on of Greece and Rome, in their conduct towards their colonies. 'Tis well known the Gre|cians were kind, humane, ju&s;t and generous towards theirs. 'Tis as notorious that the Romans were &s;evere, cruel, bru|tal and barbarous towards theirs. I have ever plea&s;ed my &s;elf in thinking that Great-Britain, &s;ince the revolution, might be ju&s;tly compared to Greece, in its care and protecti|on of its colonies. I al&s;o imagined that the French and Spaniards followed the Roman example. But our letter- writer tells quire a different &s;tory. He compliments the nation, and comforts the colonies, by declaring that the&s;e "exactly re&s;emble tho&s;e of Rome." "The <HI>Roman Coloniae,</HI>" &s;ays he, "did not enjoy all the rights of Roman citizens." "They only <HI>u&s;ed</HI> the Roman laws and religion, and &s;erved in their legions; but had no right of &s;uffrage, or bearing honours." "In the&s;e re&s;pects, adds he, our Engli&s;h colo|nies exactly re&s;emble them." "We enjoy the Engli&s;h laws and religion, but not the right of &s;uffrage or of bearing honours in Great-Britain."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="010117_0022_0F7CE96019050F50">Is this enjoying the rights, liberties and privileges of Briti&s;h-born &s;ubjects within the realm, to all intents, con|&s;tructions and purpo&s;es? I find all this confirmed to the coloni&s;ts, not only by the common law, and by their char|ters, but by act of parliament. Where does the gentleman find it decreed that the Briti&s;h "<HI>Coloniae</HI>" "have no right of bearing honours in Great-Britain"? Has not the King's maje&s;ty the fountain of honour, an undoubted right by his prerogative, to confer any rank he may be graciou&s;ly plea&s;|ed to be&s;tow on his American &s;ubjects, as well as on tho&s;e in Great-Britain? Cannot the word of a King as ea&s;ily make even a Halifaxian letter-writer, or his Rhode-I&s;land friend, a knight of the garter or thi&s;tle, as if either of them had been droped and drawn their fir&s;t breath in one of the three kingdoms.</P>
<P>The gentleman may in his anger wi&s;h for the laws of "Draco to be inforced on America," and in his fierce an|ger, for the "iron rod of a Spani&s;h inqui&s;itor." The&s;e may be &s;udden gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, without malice prepence, that only hurt his cau&s;e, and which his employers will not thank him for. But hard, very hard mu&s;t his heart be, who could employ all his &s;tock of learning in a deliberate attempt to reduce the rights of the coloni&s;ts to the narrow bound of a bare permi&s;&s;ion, to "u&s;e the Engli&s;h laws and religion without a &s;uffrage in things &s;acred or civil, and with|out a right to bear honours in Great-Britain," "except that of being &s;hot at for &s;ix pence a day, in her armies at home, as well as abroad." What is the Engli&s;h religion? Pray wherein does it differ from that of Scotland, Ireland and the Plantations? If it differs, and the colonies are obliged to <HI>u&s;e</HI> the religion of the metropolis on her embracing pagan|i&s;m, &s;o mu&s;t the colonies. Since the revolution, all di&s;&s;en|ters, both at home and abroad, papi&s;ts only excepted, have enjoyed a free and generous toleration. Would the gentle|man deprive all prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters of this invaluable ble&s;|&s;ing? If he is an American by birth, what does he de&s;erve of his country for attempting to realize to this and to all future generations, the dreary pro&s;pect of confinement to the u&s;e of the laws and religion of a region 3000 miles beyond &s;ea, in framing which laws, and in forming the
<PB N="24" REF="010117_0023_0F7CE960751FABA0">
modes of which religion, they &s;hall have no voice nor &s;uf|frage; nor &s;hall they have any preferment in church or &s;tate, tho' they &s;hall be taxed without their con&s;ent, to the &s;upport of both.</P>

<P>The gentleman hath been at great pains in order to re|pre&s;ent the merchants of America, as a parcel of infamous &s;mugglers. He &s;ays, "&s;muggling had well nigh become e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ome of the colonies." 'Tis notoriou&s;ly known who have been the great abettors and patrons of &s;mugglers, and who have &s;hared the greate&s;t part of the profits. All the riot at Ephe&s;us proceeded from certain collectors of the revenues of Diana of the Ephe&s;ians; the &s;hrine-makers and &s;ilver-&s;miths were but their tools. The craft was in danger, but if it had been only that of Deme|trius and his journeymen, we might not have heard of that day's uproar. 'Tis a very unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ion to charge the American merchants in general, with a de&s;ign to elude and evade the acts of trade. I cannot &s;o well tell how matters have been managed at Halifax or Rhode-I&s;land; but in &s;ome other colonies, only a few favorites have been indul|ged in the lucrative crime of &s;muggling, which, after an e|minent writer, the gentleman calls a crime "again&s;t the law of nature"; 'tis a wonder it had not been recorded from &s;ome old commentator, <HI>crimen le&s;ae Maje&s;tatis, high trea|&s;on.</HI> The like indulgence, as far as I can learn, has in Rhode-I&s;land, been confined al&s;o to a few choice friends. The article of Mela&s;&s;es is every where to be excepted. It was known at home, that the importation of this was uni|ver&s;ally tolerated, paying about one tenth of the duties im|po&s;ed by the old act. The connivance became very general.</P>
<P>I have peru&s;ed Mr. H&mdash;k&mdash;s book over and over, but cannot find the lea&s;t reflection on Dr. Spry, nor do I think any was intended. The Dr. perhaps may thank the gentle|man for bringing his name into que&s;tion; but I doubt not|with&s;tanding the gentleman's a&s;&s;ertions to the contrary, whe|ther the Dr's "appointments place him above any kind of influence." I believe he is under the influence of honor and con&s;cience, a clear head, and a good heart, all which
<PB N="25" REF="010117_0024_0F7CE96142C365C0">
the gentleman &s;eems too much a &s;tranger to: And &s;hould the Dr. al&s;o be under that influence, which flows from a ge|neral aver&s;ion, and contempt of flattery and fal&s;hood, he mu&s;t conceive an opinion of his Halifax neighbour, that will be very mortifying to one who hopes to make his court to the great, and to the Dr. among the re&s;t, by abu&s;ing the colonies. The Dr. hath been in America &s;ome months, but I have not heard of one cau&s;e that has been tried before him. This is a tolerable proof either, that &s;muggling was not &s;o common a thing as the letter-writer a&s;&s;erts, or that tho&s;e who u&s;ed to be concerned in it, are reformed. I think it proves both.</P>
<P>In the 21&s;t, and la&s;t page but one of the letter, the gen|tleman betho't him&s;elf, and having in a manner fini&s;hed his epi&s;tle, makes an apology for not following Mr. H&mdash;k&mdash;s "with &s;omewhat more, of method". His excu&s;e is that "Mr. H&mdash;k&mdash;s hath not divided his argument with pre|ci&s;ion". He then formally proceeds to a curious, and as he doubtle&s;s thought, preci&s;e divi&s;ion of the argument. "The di&s;pute, &s;ays he, between Great-Britain and the colonies, con&s;i&s;ts of two parts. Fir&s;t, the juri&s;diction of parliament: And &s;econdly, the exerci&s;e of that juri&s;diction: His Honor has blended the&s;e together, and no where marked the divi&s;ion between them. The fir&s;t I have prin|cipally remarked upon". I know of no di&s;pute between Great-Britain and her colonies. Who is &s;o hardy as to di&s;pute the juri&s;diction of the Parliament? But were there a thou&s;and di&s;putes between Great-Britain and the colo|nies; if the coloni&s;ts in general were as the letter-writer repre&s;ents them, "a &s;imple, credulous, and hitherto loyal people", in danger of "having their minds embittered, and their affections alienated from Great-Britain, by a few pamphlets": And if "from the pride of &s;ome, and ignorance of others, the cry again&s;t mother country had &s;pread from colony to colony, and it were to be feared that prejudices and re&s;entments were kindled among them, which it would be difficult ever thoroughly to &s;ooth or extingui&s;h", all which in&s;inuations are however very in|jurious; what would this prove again&s;t "The Rights of Colonies examined", or any other of the pamphlets that have been lately publi&s;hed in America? Mr. H&mdash;k&mdash;s,
<PB N="26" REF="010117_0025_0F7CE962015264E8">
pages 10 &amp; 11 of his book, &s;peaking of the general con|cerns of the whole Briti&s;h empire, &s;aith, "The&s;e, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould have a general power to direct them; &s;ome &s;upreme and over-ruling authority, with power to make laws, and form regulations for the good of all, and to compel their execution and ob&s;ervation. It being ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;ome &s;uch general power &s;hould exi&s;t &s;omewhere, every man of the lea&s;t knowlege of the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion, will be naturally led to look for, and find it in the parliament of Great-Britain; that grand and augu&s;t legi|&s;lative body, mu&s;t from the nature of their authority, and the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing, be ju&s;tly ve&s;ted with this power". Is not this a very clear admi&s;&s;ion and acknowledgment of the juri&s;diction, power, and authority of parliament over the colonies? What could put it into the gentleman's head to think the juri&s;diction of the parliament, was a matter in di&s;pute? I have peru&s;ed a pamphlet publi&s;hed in Connec|ticut relating to their rights, but can find no que&s;tion made of the juri&s;diction of the parliament. "The Rights of the Briti&s;h Colonies a&s;&s;erted and proved" I have al&s;o read. This was publi&s;hed before either Mr. H&mdash;k&mdash;s, or that from Connecticut. The&s;e, &s;o far as I can find, are all the pamphlets that have been publi&s;hed in America, upon the propo&s;ed new regulations of the colonies. From the knowlege I have of the &s;entiments of the "head of the <HI>tribunitian veto</HI>", as the gentleman is plea&s;ed to de&s;|cribe him, I take upon me to declare, that I have heard him in the mo&s;t public manner declare his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the authority of parliament; and that from his &s;oul he dete&s;ts and abhors the thought of making a que&s;tion of their juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The following pa&s;&s;ages from "The Rights of the Briti&s;h Colonies a&s;&s;erted and proved", may &s;erve to &s;hew how careful a hand the Halifax gentleman is at a matter of fact.</P>
<P>"I al&s;o lay it down as one of the fir&s;t principles from whence I intend to deduce the civil rights of the Briti&s;h colonies, that all of them are &s;ubject to, and dependent on Great-Britain; and that therefore as over &s;ubordinate go|vernments, the parliament of Great-Britain has an un|doubted
<PB N="27" REF="010117_0026_0F7CE962B537E2D8">
power and lawful authority&punc; to make acts for the general good, that by naming them, &s;hall and ought to be equally binding, as upon the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain within the realm. "When the parliament &s;hall think fit to allow the coloni&s;ts a repre&s;entation in the hou&s;e of com|mons, the equity of their taxing the colonies, will be as clear as their power is at pre&s;ent of doing it without, if they plea&s;e." "No &s;uch claim (i. e. of an independent legi&s;lative) was ever tho't of by the coloni&s;ts. They are all better men and better &s;ubjects; and many of them too well ver&s;ed in the laws of nature and nations, and the law and con&s;titution of Great-Britain, to think they have a right to more than a <HI>provincial &s;ubordinate legi&s;lative.</HI> All power is of GOD. Next and only &s;ubordinate to him, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the well-formed, beautiful con|&s;tructed Briti&s;h monarchy, &s;tanding where I hope it ever will &s;tand, for the pillars are fixed in judgment, righteou&s;|ne&s;s and truth, is the King and Parliament." "From all which, it &s;eems plain, that the rea&s;on why Ireland and the plantations are not bound, unle&s;s named by an act of par|liament, is, becau&s;e they are <HI>not repre&s;ented</HI> in the Briti&s;h parliament. Yet, in &s;pecial ca&s;es, the Briti&s;h parliament has an undoubted right, as well as power, to bind both by their acts. But whether this can be extended to an inde|finite taxation of both, is the great que&s;tion. I conceive the &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution mu&s;t make an exception of all taxes, until it is tho't fit to unite a dominion to the realm. Such taxation mu&s;t be con&s;idered either as uniting the dominions to the realm, or disfranchi&s;ing them. If they are united, they will be intitled to a repre&s;entation, as well as Wales: If they are &s;o taxed without a union, or repre&s;entation, they are &s;o far disfranchi&s;ed". "The &s;um of my argument is, That civil government is of God: That the admini&s;trators of it were originally the whole people: That they might have devolved it on whom they plea&s;ed: That this devolution is fiduciary, for the good of the whole; That by the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, this devolution is on the King, Lords and Commons, the &s;u|preme, &s;acred and uncontroulable legi&s;lative power, not only in the realm, but thro' the dominions: That by the
<PB N="28" REF="010117_0027_0F7CE96391912D58">
abdication, the original compact was broken to pieces: That by the revolution, it was renewed, and more firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject in all parts of the dominions, more fully explained and confirm|ed: That in con&s;equence of this e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the acts of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and union, his Maje&s;ty GEORGE III. is rightful king and &s;overeign, and with his parliament, the &s;upreme legi&s;lative of Great-Britain; France and Ireland, and the dominions thereto belonging: That this con&s;titution is the mo&s;t free one, and by far the be&s;t, now exi&s;ting on earth: That by this con&s;titution, every man in the domini|ons is a free man: That no part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions can be taxed without their con&s;ent: That every part has a right to be repre&s;ented in the &s;upreme or &s;ome &s;ubordinate legi&s;lature: That the refu&s;al of this, would &s;eem to be a contradiction in practice to the theory of the con&s;tituti|on: That the colonies are &s;ubordinate dominions, and are now in &s;uch a &s;tate, as to make it be&s;t for the good of the whole, that they &s;hould not only be continued in the en|joyment of &s;ubordinate legi&s;lation, but be al&s;o repre&s;ented in &s;ome proportion to their number and e&s;tates, in the grand legi&s;lature of the nation: That this would firmly unite all parts of the Briti&s;h empire, in the greate&s;t peace and pro&s;perity; and render it invulnerable and perpetual". <HI>Rights of the Briti&s;h Colonies, a&s;&s;erted and proved, pages</HI> 32, 48, 59, 61, 64. Can the gentleman read the&s;e pa&s;&s;a|ges, and &s;ay they imply any que&s;tion of the power and authority of parliament? Will he not blu&s;h, when he re|flects, that he hath indi&s;criminately a&s;&s;erted that the&s;e pamphlets "have a tendency to embitter the minds of a &s;imple, credulous and hitherto loyal people, and to alienate their affections from Great-Britain, their be&s;t friend and <HI>alma mater</HI>"? Can terms expre&s;&s;ive of greater loyalty or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the juri&s;diction and authority of parliament be conceived, than many that are to be found in tho&s;e pamphlets? Yet the gentleman has the effrontery to talk of the "frequent abu&s;e poured forth in pamphlets again&s;t the mother country", and laments that before his "not one filial pen in America had been drawn in her vindica|tion". How grand we look! Are not his dragoons
<PB N="29" REF="010117_0028_0F7CE9648F6D62F8">
enough, but he mu&s;t fight with his pen too? I believe he mu&s;t be a man of parlous courage; and yet he is mode&s;t withal. He &s;ays he has "no ambition of ap|pearing in print", tho' he is the only loyal &s;ubject his Maje&s;ty hath in his American dominions, and ma&s;ter of the only filial pen, worth a button. If this be true, well might he call his countrymen a parcel of &s;coundrels, rebels, &s;muglers and traitors. I &s;hall take leave of my gentleman, by de&s;iring him to reflect, in his cooler hours, and well con&s;ider what would &s;oon be his fate, if the Americans &s;hould treat him as he mo&s;t richly de&s;erves.</P>

<HEAD>Po&s;t&s;cript.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the above &s;heets were fini&s;hed, two or three pieces have been publi&s;hed in the Providence Gazette. The fir&s;t of the&s;e hath furni&s;hed us with a clear and conci&s;e account of the &s;everal principal rea&s;onings and arguments upon the &s;ubject of internal taxes to be impo&s;ed on the colonies by parliament, while they are unrepre&s;ented in the hou&s;e of commons. The &s;um is.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is the inconte&s;tible right of the &s;ubject in Great-Britain, not to be taxed out of parliament; and every &s;ubject within the realm is in fact or in law repre&s;ented there.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Briti&s;h coloni&s;ts being Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, are to all intents and purpo&s;es intitled to the rights, liberties and privileges of the &s;ubject within the realm, and ought to be repre&s;ented in fact as well as in law, in the &s;upreme or &s;ome &s;ubordinate legi&s;lature, where they are taxed; el&s;e they will be deprived of one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject namely that of being free from all taxes, but &s;uch as he &s;hall by him&s;elf or repre&s;entative, grant and a&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the colonies have been erected into &s;ubordinate dependent do|minions, with &s;ubordinate powers of legi&s;lation; particularly that of le|vying taxes for the &s;upport of their re&s;pective &s;ubordinate governments, and at their own expence, have not only &s;upported the civil provincial admini&s;tration, but many of them have, to their utmo&s;t ability, contri|buted both in men and money for the common cau&s;e, as well as for their more immediate defence again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's enemies, it &s;hould &s;eem very hard that they &s;hould be taxed al&s;o by parliament, and that before they are allowed a repre&s;entation in fact, and while they are quite unable to pay &s;uch additional taxes.</P>
<P N="4">4. The immen&s;e commercial advantages re&s;ulting to Great Britain from her plantations, the revenues thence ari&s;ing to the crown the taxes we pay by the con&s;umption of an infinity of Briti&s;h manufactures, may be tho't a rea&s;onable return for the protection received, as 'tis really all that at pre&s;ent is in our power to yield.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the colonies could and ought to yield greater aids towards the national expence. yet it &s;hould &s;eem but rea&s;onable either to allow them 1. To rai&s;e &s;uch further &s;ums as may be required, by taxing them&s;elves in the mo&s;t ea&s;y way and manner their &s;everal provincial legi&s;latures could devi&s;e. Or, 2. at lea&s;t to allow them a repre&s;entation in the hou&s;e of commons. This with &s;ome animadver&s;ions on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of commerce, with the exten&s;ion and enlargement of the admiralty juri&s;diction in America, is the &s;ub&s;tance of all that has &s;o much incen&s;ed the Halifax gentleman. Governor H&mdash;k&mdash;s hath no where &s;aid that "the colonies have rights independent of, and not controulable by, the authority of parliament."</P>

<P>"There may be a natural relation between two &s;ubjects that exi&s;t by nature; but mother country and colony exi&s;t only by policy, and may, and no doubt have a political relation to each other; but can have no natural one"</P>
<BIBL><HI>Providence Gazette March</HI> 2.</BIBL>
<P>This remark is ingenious, and the manner in which 'tis elucidated is diverting; but I fear 'tis not &s;olid. There is non&s;en&s;e &amp; contradiction eno' of all con&s;cience in the Halifax gentleman's attempt to inve&s;tigate: the "natural relation between colonies and their mother &s;tate," without denying the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a relation. Our allegiance is natural, and if this be admitted of each individual in a colony, as it mu&s;t be, it would be &s;trange to deny a natural relation between two whole bodies, between all the re&s;pective parts of which a natural relation is admitted. Society is certainly natural, and exi&s;ts prior to, and independent of any form of civil policy, always excepting family &s;ocieties and &s;imple democracies. As there is a natural relation between father and &s;on &s;o is there between their two families; and &s;o is there between a mother-&s;tate or metropo|lis, and its colonies The natural relation between two independent &s;tates or &s;ocieties, is the ba&s;is of the law of nations; and all its obliga|tions are thence deduceable. It would be &s;trange that a natural relation &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between two neighbouring &s;tates, and none be between a metropolis and a colony. I can &s;ee no ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing both na|tural and political relations to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between a mother &s;tate and its co|lonies, any more than &s;uppo&s;ing two qualities in one and the &s;ame &s;ubject. The &s;ame man may be choloric &amp; humane another is calm &amp; inveterate. The &s;ame two men may be father and &s;on, fellow men, fellow-&s;ubjects, fellow-citizens and brother-aldermen. Political relations are but modifi|cations of tho&s;e which are founded in nature, and from whence ri&s;e duties of univer&s;al obligation.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;uppre&s;s all my indignation at a remark in the clo&s;e of the Halifax letter which &s;hould have been taken notice of before, but it e&s;|caped me. "It may become nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upreme legi&s;lature of the
<PB N="32" REF="010117_0031_0F7CE96815D71468">
nation to frame &s;ome code, (and canons might have been as properly added) and therein adju&s;t the rights of the colonies, with preci&s;ion and certainty, otherwi&s;e Great Britain will always be teazed with new claims about liberty and privileges." Page 22.</P>
<P>If I mi&s;take not, there is in the air of this period, the quinte&s;&s;ence of a meer martial legi&s;lator; the in&s;olence of a haughty and imperious mini&s;ter; the indolence and half thought of a petit maitre; the flutter of a coxcomb; the pedantry of a quack, and the non&s;en&s;e of a pettifogger. A &s;trange gallimaufry this: but I am not an&s;werable for it, or for any other of the exhibitions of a mon&s;ter monger. We want no foreign codes, nor canons here. The common law is our birth right; and the rights and privileges confirmed and &s;ecured to us by the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and by act of parliament, are our be&s;t inheritance. Codes, pandects, novells, decretals of Popes, and the inventions of the D&mdash;I, may &s;uit the cold bleak regions Branden|burgh and Pru&s;&s;ia, or the &s;corching heats of Jamaica or Gambia; but we live in a more temperate climate, and &s;hall re&s;t content with the laws, cu&s;toms and u&s;ages of our ance&s;tors, bravely &s;upported and de|fended with the monarchy, and from age to age handed down. The&s;e have, and ever will finally triumph over the whims of political and religious Enthu&s;ia&s;ts; the extremes of which are libertini&s;m and de&s;poti&s;m, anarchy and tyranny, &s;piritual and temporal, from all which may God ever pre&s;erve us. I mu&s;t recommend it to the Halifax gentleman, before he publi&s;hes any more epi&s;tles, diligently to read over Swifts Tale of a Tub, and to take &s;pecial note of Lord Peter's method of rea&s;oning with his brethren. He will there find all the forms of &s;yllogi&s;m, from the <HI>&s;orites</HI> to the categoric. Of the la&s;t form, he will find this, to prove that a little learning puffeth little men up.</P>
<L>"Words are but wind,</L>
<L>Learning is nothing but words,</L>
<L><HI>Ergo.</HI> Learning is nothing but wind."</L>
<P>Of the former kind of argumentation, he will find a &s;pecies he &s;eems to be peculiarly fond of.</P>
<P>"In the mid&s;t of all this clutter and revolution, in comes Lord Peter, with a file of dragoons at his heels, and gathering from all hands what was in the wind, he and his gang, after &s;everal millions of &s;currilities and cur&s;es, not very important here to repeat, by main force, very fairly kicks them (Martyn and Jack) both cut of doors, and would never let them come under his roof, from that day to this".</P>
