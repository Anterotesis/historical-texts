<HEAD>THE PRESENT POLITICAL STATE, OF THE PROVINCE OF MASSACHUSETTS-BAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a people, by what means &s;oever, are reduced to &s;uch a &s;ituation, that every thing they hold dear, as men and citizens, is at &s;take, it is not only ex|cu&s;able, but even prai&s;eworthy for an individual to offer to the public any thing that he may think has a tendency to ward off the impending dan|ger, nor &s;hould he be re&s;trained, from an ap|prehen&s;ion that what he may offer will be unpo|pular, any more than a phy&s;ician &s;hould be re|&s;trained from pre&s;cribing a &s;alutary medicine through fear it might be unpalatable to his patient.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="014158_0004_0F932F5D49644818">The pre&s;s, when open to all parties, influ|enced by none, is a &s;alutary engine in a free &s;tate, perhaps a nece&s;&s;ary one to pre&s;erve the fre|dom of that &s;tate; but, when a party has gained the a&s;cendency &s;o far as to become the licen&s;ers of the pre&s;s, either by an act of government, or by playing off the re&s;entment of the populace, again&s;t printers and authors, the pre&s;s it&s;elf be|comes an engine of oppre&s;&s;ion and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and is as pernicious to &s;ociety, as otherwi&s;e it would be beneficial. It is too true to be denied that &s;ince our controver&s;y with Great-Britain, the pre&s;s in this town has been much devoted to the partizans of liberty, they have been indulged in publi&s;hing what they plea&s;ed, <HI>fas vel nefas,</HI> while little has been publi&s;hed on the part of go|vernment, the effect this mu&s;t have had upon the minds of the people in general is obvious; they mu&s;t have formed their opinion upon a par|tial view of the &s;ubject, and of cour&s;e it mu&s;t have been in &s;ome degree erroneous; in &s;hort the changes have been rung &s;o often upon oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny and &s;lavery, that whether &s;leeping or waking, they are continually vibrating in our ears, and it is now high time to a&s;k our&s;elves whether we have not been deluded by &s;ound only.</P>
<P>My dear countrymen, let us dive&s;t our&s;elves of prejudice, take a view of our pre&s;ent wretch|ed &s;ituation, contra&s;t it with our former happy one, carefully inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e, and indu&s;|triou&s;ly &s;eek &s;ome means to e&s;cape the evils we now feel, and prevent tho&s;e that we have rea&s;on to expect.</P>

&s;tate, and by &s;uch gradations, that perhaps many of us are in&s;en&s;ible of our true &s;tate and real danger. Should you be told that acts of high trea&s;on are flagrant through the country, that a great part of the province is in actual re|bellion, would you believe it true? Should you not deem the per&s;on a&s;&s;erting of it an enemy to the province? Nay &s;hould you not &s;purn him from you with indignation? Be calm, my friends, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know the wor&s;t of a di&s;ea&s;e, to enable us to provide an effectual remedy. Are not the bonds of &s;ociety cut a&s;under, and the &s;anctions, that hold man to man trampled upon? Can any of us recover a debt, or obtain compen|&s;ation for an injury, by law? Are not many per&s;ons who once we re&s;pected and revered, forc|ed to fly from their homes and families, to the army for protection, for no other rea&s;on but their having accepted commi&s;&s;ions under our King? Is not civil government di&s;&s;olved? Some have been made to believe that nothing &s;hort of attempting the life of the King, or fighting his troops can amount to high trea&s;on, or rebellion. If, reader, you are one of tho&s;e, apply to an ho|ne&s;t lawyer&punc; (if &s;uch a one can be found) and en|quire what kind of offence it is for a number of men to a&s;&s;emble armed, and forceably ob&s;truct the courts of ju&s;tice, even to prevent the King's courts from being held at the &s;tated terms; for a body of people to &s;eize upon the King's pro|vincial revenue: I mean the monies collected by virtue of grants made by the General Court, to his Maje&s;ty, for the &s;upport of his government with|in this province; for a body of men to a&s;&s;emble without being called by authority, and to pa&s;s

governmental acts, or for a number of people to take the militia out of the hands of the King's Repre&s;entative, or to form a new militia, or to rai&s;e men and appoint officers, for a public pur|po&s;e, without the order or permi&s;&s;ion of the King, or his repre&s;entative; or for a number of men to take to their arms, and march, with a profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of oppo&s;ing the King's troops; a&s;k, reader, of &s;uch a lawyer what is the crime, and what the puni&s;hment, and if per chance thou art one that ha&s;t been active in tho&s;e things, and art not in&s;en&s;ibility it&s;elf; his an&s;wer will harrow up thy &s;oul.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, my friends, I would not that this conduct &s;hould be told beyond the borders of this province, I wi&s;h it were con&s;igned to perpetual oblivion: but alas, it is too notorious &s;o to be concealed, our news-papers have already publi&s;hed it to the world, we can neither pre|vent nor conceal it, the &s;haft is already &s;ped, and the utmo&s;t exertion is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the blow. We already feel the effects of anar|chy, mutual confidence, affection and tranquilli|ty, tho&s;e &s;weetners of human life, are &s;ucceeded by di&s;tru&s;t, hatred and wild uproar; the u&s;eful arts of agriculture and commerce are neglected for caballing, mobbing this or the other man, becau&s;e he acts, &s;peaks, or is &s;u&s;pected of think|ing different from the prevailing &s;entiment of the times, in purcha&s;ing arms, and forming a militia. O height of madne&s;s! with a profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of oppo&s;ing Great-Britain.&mdash;I &s;u&s;pect ma|ny of us have been induced to join in the mea|&s;ures, or but faintly to oppo&s;e them, from an ap|prehen&s;ion that Great-Britain would not, or could

not exert her&s;elf &s;ufficiently to &s;ubdue America. Let us con&s;ider this matter. However clo&s;e we may hug our&s;elves in the opinion that the par|liament has no right to tax or legi&s;late for us, the people of England hold the contrary opinion as firmly; they tell us we are a part of the Briti&s;h empire, that every &s;tate, from the nature of go|vernment, mu&s;t have a &s;upreme uncontroulable power, co-exi&s;tent with the empire it&s;elf, and that that power is ve&s;ted in parliament; it is as unpopular to deny this doctrine in Great-Britain as it is to a&s;&s;ert it in the colonies, &s;o there is but little probability of &s;erving our&s;elves at this day by our ingenious di&s;tinctions between external and internal taxes, between a right of legi&s;lation for one purpo&s;e and not for another. We have bid them defiance, and the longe&s;t &s;word mu&s;t carry it, unle&s;s we change our mea&s;ures. Man|kind are the &s;ame in all parts of the world, the &s;ame fondne&s;s for dominion that pre&s;ides in the brea&s;t of an American, rules in the brea&s;t of an European. If the colonies are not a part of the Briti&s;h empire already, and &s;ubject to the &s;u|preme authority of the &s;tate, Great-Britain will make them &s;o. Had we been prudent enough to confine our oppo&s;ition within certain limits, we might have &s;tood &s;ome chance of &s;ucceeding once more, but alas, we have pa&s;&s;ed the Rubi|con. It is now univer&s;ally &s;aid and believed in England, that if this opportunity of reclaiming the colonies, and reducing them to a &s;en&s;e of their duty, is lo&s;t, they, in truth, will be di&s;|membered from the empire, and become as di&s;|tinct a &s;tate from Great-Britain as Hanover; that is, although they may continue their alle|giance

to the per&s;on of the King, they will own none to the imperial crown of Great-Britain, nor yield obedience to any of her laws, but &s;uch as they &s;hall think proper to adopt. Can you in|dulge the thought for one moment, that Great- Britain will con&s;ent to this? For what has &s;he protected and defended the colonies again&s;t the maritime powers of Europe, from the fir&s;t Brit|i&s;h &s;ettlement to this day? For what did &s;he pur|cha&s;e New-York of the Dutch? For what was &s;he &s;o lavi&s;h of her be&s;t blood and trea&s;ure in the conque&s;t of Canada, and other territories in Ame|rica? Was it to rai&s;e up a rival &s;tate, or to en|large her own empire? Or if the con&s;ideration of an empire was out of the que&s;tion, what &s;e|curity can &s;he have of our trade, when once &s;he has lo&s;t our obedience? I mention the&s;e things, my friends, that you may know how people rea|&s;on upon the &s;ubject in England, and to con|vince you that you are much deceived if you ima|gine Great-Britain will accede to the claims of the colonies; &s;he will as &s;oon conquer New- England, as Ireland or Canada, if either of them revolted, and by arms, if the milder influences of government prove ineffectual? Perhaps you are as fatally mi&s;taken in another re&s;pect, I mean as to the power of Great-Britain to conquer, but can any of you that think &s;oberly upon the mat|ter, be &s;o deluded as to believe that Great-Bri|tain, who &s;o lately carried her arms with &s;ucce&s;s to every part of the globe, triumphed over the united powers of France and Spain, and who&s;e fleets gave law to the ocean, is unable to con|quer us?</P>

Great-Britain (which by the way is not a &s;up|po&s;eable ca&s;e) the colonies &s;outh of Penn&s;ylvania would be unable to furni&s;h any men; they have not more than is nece&s;&s;ary to govern their nume|rous &s;laves, and defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Indians. I will &s;uppo&s;e that the northern colo|nies can furni&s;h as many, and indeed more men than can be u&s;ed to advantage, but have you arms fit for a campaign? If you have arms, have you military &s;tores, or can you procure them? When this war is proclaimed, all &s;upplies from foreign parts will be cut off. Have you money to maintain the war? Or had you all tho&s;e things, &s;ome others are &s;till wanting, which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to encounter regular troops, that is di&s;cipline, and that &s;ubordination where|by each can command all below him, from a ge|neral officer to the lowe&s;t &s;ubaltern, the&s;e you neither have nor can have in &s;uch a war. It is well known that the provincials in the late war were never brought to a proper di&s;cipline, though they had the example of the regular troops to encourage, and the martial law to en|force it. We all know, notwith&s;tanding the province law for regulating the militia, it was under little more command than what the offi|cers could obtain from treating and humouring the common &s;oldiers; what then can be expect|ed from &s;uch an army as you will bring into the field, if you bring any, each one a politician, puffed up with his own opinion, and feeling him|&s;elf &s;econd to none? Can any of you command forty-thou&s;and &s;uch men? Can you puni&s;h the di&s;obedient? Can all your wi&s;dom direct their &s;trength, courage, or activity to any given point?

Would not the lea&s;t di&s;appointment, or unfa|vourable a&s;pect cau&s;e a general dereliction of the &s;ervice? Your new-fangled militia have already given us a &s;pecimen of their future conduct, in &s;ome of their companies; they have already cho|&s;en two, in others three &s;etts of officers, and are as di&s;&s;atisfied with the la&s;t choice as the fir&s;t. I do not doubt the natural bravery of my coun|trymen, all men would act the &s;ame part in the &s;ame &s;ituation; &s;uch is the army with which you are to oppo&s;e the mo&s;t powerful nation upon the globe.</P>
<P>An experienced officer would rather take his chance with five thou&s;and Briti&s;h troops, than with fifty-thou&s;and &s;uch militia. I have hither|to confined my ob&s;ervations to the war within the interior parts of the colonies, let us now turn our eyes to our exten&s;ive &s;ea coa&s;ts; and that we find wholly at the mercy of Great-Britain; our trade, fi&s;hery, navigation and maritime towns taken from us the very day that war is pro|claimed, inconceivably &s;hocking the &s;cene; if we turn our views to the wilderne&s;s, our back &s;ettlements a prey to our ancient enemy, the Ca|nadians, who&s;e wounds received from us, in the late war, will bleed afre&s;h at the pro&s;pect of re|venge, and to the numerous tribes of &s;avages, who&s;e tender mercies are cruelties; thus with the Briti&s;h navy in the front, Canadians and &s;avages in the rear, a regular army in the mid&s;t, we mu&s;t be certain that whenever the &s;word of civil war is un&s;heathed, de&s;olation will pa&s;s through our land like a whirlwind, our hou&s;es be burnt to a&s;hes, our fair po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions laid wa&s;te, and he that

<P>I have hitherto gone upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that all the colonies from Nova-Scotia, to Georgia, would unite in the war again&s;t Great-Britain; but I believe, if we con&s;ider cooly upon the matter, we &s;hall find no rea&s;on to expect any a&s;&s;i&s;tance out of New-England; if &s;o, there will be no arm &s;tretched out to &s;ave us, New-England, or perhaps this &s;elf-devoted province will fall alone the unpitied victim of its own folly, and furni&s;h the world with one more in&s;tance of the fatal con&s;equences of rebellion.</P>
<P>I have, as yet, &s;aid nothing of the different &s;en|timents among our&s;elves; upon a &s;uperficial view we might imagine that this province was nearly unanimous, but the ca&s;e is far different; a very con&s;iderable part of the men of property in this province, are at this day firmly attached to the cau&s;e of government; bodies of men com|pelling per&s;ons to di&s;avow their &s;entiments, to re&s;ign commi&s;&s;ions, or to &s;ub&s;cribe leagues and covenants, has wrought no change in their &s;en|timents, it has only attached them more clo&s;ely to government, and cau&s;ed them to wi&s;h more &s;ervently, and to pray more devoutly for its re|&s;toration; the&s;e, and thou&s;ands be&s;ide, if they fight at all, will fight under the banner of loyalty.</P>
<P>I can a&s;&s;ure you that a&s;&s;ociations are now form|ing in &s;everal parts of this province, for the &s;upport of his Maje&s;ty's government and mutual defence; and let me tell you whenever the royal &s;tandard &s;hall be &s;et up, there will be &s;uch a flocking to it, as will a&s;toni&s;h the mo&s;t obdurate.

to this brink of de&s;truction? Has not the go|vernment of Great-Britain been as mild and equi|table in the colonies, as in any part of her exten|&s;ive dominions? Has not &s;he been a nur&s;ing mother to us from the day of our infancy to this time? has &s;he not been indulged almo&s;t to a fault? Might not each of us at this day have &s;at quietly under his own vine and fig-tree, and there have been none to make us afraid, were it not for our own folly? Will not po&s;terity be amazed when they are told that the pre&s;ent di&s;|traction took its ri&s;e from the parliament's taking off a &s;hilling duty on a pound of tea, and im|po&s;ing three pence, and call it a more unaccount|able phrenzy, and more di&s;graceful to the an|nals of America, than that of the witchcraft?

<P>At the conclu&s;ion of the late war, Great-Bri|tain found, that though &s;he had humbled her enemies, and greatly enlarged her own empire, that the national debt amounted to no le&s;s than one hundred and fifty millions, and that the an|nual expence of keeping her extended dominions

in a &s;tate of defence, which good policy dictates no le&s;s in a time of peace than war, was increa&s;ed in proportion to the new acqui&s;itions. Heavy taxes and duties were already laid, not only upon the luxuries and conveniencies, but even the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life in Great-Britain and Ireland. She knew that her colonies were as much benefited by the conque&s;t, in the late war, as any part of the empire; and indeed more &s;o, as their con|tinental foes were &s;ubdued, and they might now extend their &s;ettlements, not only to Canada, but even to the we&s;tern ocean. The greate&s;t open|ing was given to agriculture, the natural liveli|hood of the country, that ever was known in the hi&s;tory of the world, and their trade pro|tected by the Briti&s;h navy. The revenue to the crown, from America, amounts to but little more than the charges of collecting it. She thought it as rea&s;onable that the colonies &s;hould bear a part of the national burden, as that they &s;hould &s;hare in the national benefit. For this, purpo&s;e the &s;tamp-act was pa&s;&s;ed. The colonies &s;oon found that the duties impo&s;ed by the &s;tamp-act would be grievous, and as they were laid upon cu&s;tom-hou&s;e paper, law proceedings, convey|ancing, and indeed extended to all their internal trade and dealings. It was generally believed through the colonies, that this was a tax not on|ly exceeding our proportion, but beyond our ut|mo&s;t ability to pay. This idea united the colo|nies generally in oppo&s;ing it. At fir&s;t we did not dream of denying the <HI>authority</HI> of parliament to tax us, much le&s;s to legi&s;late for us. We knew that by our fir&s;t charter, our exclu&s;ive right of taxation was to continue but twenty

years. We had always con&s;idered our&s;elves as a part of the Briti&s;h empire, and the parliament as the &s;upreme legi&s;lature of the whole. Acts of parliament for regulating internal policy were fa|miliar. We had paid po&s;tage agreeable to act of parliament, for e&s;tabli&s;hing a po&s;t-office, du|ties impo&s;ed for regulating trade, and even for rai&s;ing a revenue to the crown, without que&s;tion|ing the right, though we clo&s;ely adverted to the rate, or quantum. We know that in all tho&s;e acts of government, the good of the whole had been con&s;ulted, and whenever through want of information, any thing grievous had been or|dained, we were &s;ure of obtaining redre&s;s by a proper repre&s;entation of it. We were happy in our &s;ubordination; but in an evil hour, under the influence of &s;ome malignant planet, the de|&s;ign was formed of oppo&s;ing the &s;tamp-act, by a denial of the right of parliament to make it.</P>
<P>The love of empire is &s;o predominant in the human brea&s;t, that we rarely find an individual content with relinqui&s;hing a power that he is able to retain, over a body of men.

that a&s;&s;erted it. The news-papers were open to but one &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and the inflamma|tory pieces that i&s;&s;ued weekly from the pre&s;s, worked the populace to a fit temper to commit the outrage that en&s;ued. A non-importation was agreed upon, which alarmed the merchants and manufacturers in England. It was novel, and the people in England then &s;uppo&s;ed that the love of liberty was &s;o powerful in an American merchant, as to &s;tifle his love of gain, and that the agreement would be religiou&s;ly adhered to. It has been &s;aid, that &s;everal thou&s;ands were ex|pended in England, to foment the di&s;turbances there. However that may be, oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;try was then gaining ground, from circum|&s;tances foreign to this. The mini&s;try was chang|ed, and the &s;tamp-act repealed. The repealing &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed with difficulty however through the Hou&s;e of Lords, forty at lea&s;t prote&s;ted again&s;t giving way to &s;uch an oppo&s;ition, and foretold what has &s;ince literally come to pa&s;s in con&s;equence of it. When the &s;tatute was made, impo&s;ing duties upon gla&s;s, paper, India teas, &amp;c. imported into the colonies, it was &s;aid, that this was another in&s;tance of taxation, for &s;ome of the dutied comodities were nece&s;&s;aries, we had them not within our&s;elves, were prohibited from im|porting them from any place, except Great-Bri|tain, and con&s;equently were obliged to pay the duties. Accordingly news-paper publications, pamphlets, re&s;olves, non-importation agreements, and the whole &s;y&s;tem of American oppo&s;ition was again put in motion. We obtained a partial repeal of this &s;tatute, which took off the duties from all the articles except teas. This was the
<PB N="17" REF="014158_0017_0F932FCD0C5CFE48">
lucky moment to have clo&s;ed the di&s;pute. We might have made a &s;afe and honourable retreat. We had gained much, perhaps more than we expected. If the parliament had pa&s;&s;ed an act declarative of their right to tax us, our a&s;&s;emb|lies had re&s;olved, ten times, that they had no &s;uch right. We could not complain of the three penny duty on tea, as burden&s;ome, for a &s;hil|ling which had been laid upon it, for the pur|po&s;e of regulating the trade, and therefore was allowed to be con&s;titutional, was taken off; &s;o that we were in fact gainers, nine pence in a pound, by the new regulation. If the appro|priation of the revenue, ari&s;ing, from this &s;tatute, was di&s;reli&s;hed, it was only our &s;triking off one article of luxury from our manner of living, an article too, which, if we may believe the re&s;olves of mo&s;t of the towns in this province, or rely on its collected wi&s;dom in a re&s;olve of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, was to the la&s;t degree ruinous to health. It was futile to urge its being a pre|cedent, as a rea&s;on for keeping up the ball of contention; for, allowing the &s;upreme legi&s;lature ever to want a precedent, they had many for laying duties on commodities imported into the colonies; one of which I will mention, the &s;ta|tute commonly called the mola&s;&s;es act, by which a duty is laid upon mola&s;&s;es imported into the&s;e colonies, and the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, is expre&s;sly mentioned: And be&s;ides, we had great rea&s;on to believe that the remaining part of the &s;tatute would be repealed, as &s;oon as the parlia|ment &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it could be done with ho|nour to them&s;elves, as the incidental revenue ari&s;ing from the former regulation, was three-fold
<PB N="18" REF="014158_0018_0F932FCDD879AFA0">
to the revenue ari&s;ing from the latter. A claim of the right, could work no injury, &s;o long as there was no grievous exerci&s;e of it, e&s;pecially as we had prote&s;ted again&s;t it, through the whole, and could not be &s;aid to have departed from our claims in the lea&s;t. We might now upon good terms have dropped the di&s;pute, and been happy in the affections of our mother country; but that is yet to come. Party is in&s;eparable from a free &s;tate. The &s;everal di&s;tributions of power as they are limited by, &s;o they create perpetual di&s;|&s;entions between each other, about their re&s;pec|tive boundaries; but the greate&s;t &s;ource is the competition of individuals for preferment in the &s;tate. Popularity is the ladder by which the partizans u&s;ually climb. Accordingly the &s;trugg|le is, who &s;hall have the greate&s;t &s;hare of it. Each party profe&s;&s;es di&s;intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m, though &s;ome cynical writers have ventured to a&s;|&s;ert, that &s;elf-love is the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the whole. There were two parties in this province of pretty long &s;tanding, known by the names of Whig and Tory, which at this time were not a little imbittered again&s;t each other. Men of abi|lities and acknowledged probity were on both &s;ides. It is not for me to determine which was the real, and which the fal&s;e patriot. If the Tories were &s;u&s;pected of pur&s;uing their private intere&s;t through the medium of court favour, there was equal rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the Whigs of pur&s;uing their private intere&s;t by means of po|pularity. Indeed &s;ome of them owed all their importance to it, and mu&s;t in a little time have &s;unk into ob&s;curity, had the&s;e turbulent com|motions then &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="014158_0019_0F932FCE88FBD9B8">The Tories and Whigs took different routs, as u&s;ual. The Tories were for clo&s;ing the con|trover&s;y with Great-Britain, the Whigs for con|tinuing it; the Tories were for re&s;toring govern|ment in the province, which had become greatly relaxed by the&s;e convul&s;ions, to its former tone; the Whigs were aver&s;e to it; they even refu&s;ed to revive a temporary riot act, which expired about this time. Perhaps they thought that mobs were a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in their &s;y&s;tem of oppo&s;ition: However, the Whigs had great advantages in the unequal combat, that &s;cheme flattered the people with the idea of indepen|dence; the Tories plan &s;uppo&s;ed a degree of &s;ubordination, which is rather an humiliating idea; be&s;ides, there is a propen&s;ity in men to believe them&s;elves injured and oppre&s;&s;ed when|ever they are told &s;o: the ferment rai&s;ed in their minds, in the time of the &s;tamp-act, was not yet allayed, and the leaders of the Whigs had gained the confidence of the people by their &s;ucce&s;s in their former &s;truggles, &s;o that they had nothing to do but to keep up the &s;pirit among the peop|le, and they were &s;ure of commanding this pro|vince. It required &s;ome pains to prevent their minds &s;ettling into that calm which is ordinarily the effect of a mild government: the Whigs were &s;en&s;ible that there was no oppre&s;&s;ion that could be either &s;een or felt; if any thing was in reality ami&s;s in government; it was its being too lax. So far was it from the innocent being in danger of &s;uffering, that the mo&s;t attrocious offender e&s;|caped with impunity. They accordingly applied them&s;elves to work upon the imagination, and to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions: for this work they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed

<P>I &s;hall next trace the effects of this &s;pirit which the Whigs had infu&s;ed into the body of the people, through the courts of common law, and the General A&s;&s;embly, and mark the ways and means whereby they availed them&s;elves of it to the &s;ubver&s;ion of our charter con&s;titution, ante|cedent to the late act of Parliament, and erected a provincial democracy, or rather republic upon its ruins, though the form and &s;emblance of the monarchial and ari&s;tocratical parts &s;till remained.</P>

them content to re&s;t the affairs of government in the hands where accident, or merit, has placed them. Their views and employments are con|fined to the humbler walks of bu&s;ine&s;s or retire|ment. There is a latent &s;park however in their brea&s;ts, capable of being kindled into a flame; to do this has always been the employment of the di&s;affected. They begin by reminding the people of the elevated rank they hold in the uni|ver&s;e, as men; that all men by nature are equal; that Kings are but the mini&s;ters of the people; that their authority is delegated to them by the people, for their good, and they have a right to re&s;ume it, and place it in other hands, or keep it them&s;elves, whenever it is made u&s;e of to op|re&s;s them. Doubtle&s;s there have been in&s;tances where the&s;e principles have been inculcated to obtain a redre&s;s of real grievances; but they have been much oftener perverted to the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es.&mdash;No government, however perfect in theory, is admini&s;tered in perfection, the frail|ty of man does not admit of it. A &s;mall mi&s;|take in point of policy, often furni&s;hes a pre|tence to libel government, and per&s;uade the people that their rulers are tyrants, and the whole government a &s;y&s;tem of oppre&s;&s;ion. Thus the &s;eeds of &s;edition are u&s;ually &s;own, and the people are led to &s;acrifice real liberty to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which gradually ripens into rebellion and civil war. And what is &s;till more to be lamented, the generality of the people, who are thus made the dupes of artifice, and the mere &s;tilts of ambi|tion, are &s;ure to be loo&s;ers in the end. The be&s;t they can expect is to be thrown neglected by, when they are no longer wanted; but they are

&s;eldom &s;o happy; if they are &s;ubdued, confi&s;ca|tion of e&s;tate, and an ignominious death are their portion; if they conquer, their own army is often turned upon them, to &s;ubjugate them to a more tyrannical government than they had rebelled again&s;t. Hi&s;tory is replete with in&s;tances of this kind. We can trace them in remote antiquity, we find them in modern times, and have a very remarkable one in the very country from which we were derived. It is an univer&s;al truth, that he that would excite a rebellion, whatever pro|fe&s;&s;ions of philantrophy he may make when he is in&s;inuating and worming him&s;elf into the good graces of the people, is at heart as great a ty|rant as ever wielded the iron rod of oppre&s;&s;i|on. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion hereafter to con&s;ider this matter more fully, when I &s;hall endeavour to convince you how little we can gain, and how much we may loo&s;e, by this unequal, unna|tural, and de&s;perate conte&s;t. My pre&s;ent bu&s;i|ne&s;s is to trace the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition to Great- Britain through the general court, and the courts of common law. In moderate times, repre|&s;entative that votes for an unpopular mea&s;ure, or oppo&s;es a popular one, is in danger of loo&s;ing his election the next year, and when party runs high, he is &s;ure to do it. It was the policy of the Whigs to have their que&s;tions upon high matters determined by yea and nay votes, which were publi&s;hed with the repre&s;entatives names in the next Gazette. This was commonly followed by &s;evere &s;trictures, and the mo&s;t illeberal invec|tives upon the di&s;&s;entients; &s;ometimes they were held up as objects of re&s;entment and contempt, at others the abu&s;e was in proportion to the ex|travagance
<PB N="26" REF="014158_0026_0F932FD3CCD0CEB8">
of the mea&s;ure they oppo&s;ed. This may &s;eem not worth notice, but its con&s;equences were important. The &s;currillity made its way into the di&s;&s;entient's town, it furni&s;hed his com|petitor with means to &s;upplant them, and he took care to &s;hun the rock his predece&s;&s;or had &s;plit upon. In this temper of the times, it was enough to know who voted with Ca&s;&s;ius, and who with Lucius, to determine who was a friend, and who was an enemy to the country, without once adverting to the que&s;tion before the hou&s;e. The lo&s;s of a &s;eat in the hou&s;e was not of &s;o much con&s;equence, but when once he became &s;tigmatized as an enemy to his country, he was expo&s;ed to in&s;ult, and if his profe&s;&s;ion, or bu&s;i|ne&s;s was &s;uch, that his livelihood depended much on the good graces of his fellow citizens, he was in danger of loo&s;ing his bread, and involving his whole family into ruin.</P>
<P>One particular &s;et of members in committee, always prepared the re&s;olves, and other &s;pirited mea&s;ures: at fir&s;t they were canva&s;&s;ed freely, at length would, &s;lide through the hou&s;e without meeting any ob&s;tacle, the lips of the di&s;&s;entients were &s;ealed up; they &s;at in &s;ilence, and beheld with infinite regret the mea&s;ures they dur&s;t not oppo&s;e. Many were borne down again&s;t their wills, by the violence of the current; upon no other principle can we reconcile their o&s;ten&s;ible conduct in the hou&s;e to their declarations in pri|vate circles. The apparent unanimity in the hou&s;e encouraged the oppo&s;ition out of doors, and that in its turn &s;trengthened the party in the hou&s;e. Thus they went on mutually &s;upporting and up-lifting each other. A&s;&s;emblies and
<PB N="27" REF="014158_0027_0F932FD48B7E3708">
towns re&s;olved alternately, &s;ome of them only omitted re&s;olving to &s;natch the &s;ceptre out of the hands of our Sovereign, and to &s;trike the imperial crown from his &s;acred head.</P>
<P>A ma&s;ter-&s;troke in polities, re&s;pecting the agent, ought not to be neglected. Each colony has u&s;ually an agent re&s;iding at the court of Great-Britain. The&s;e agents are appointed by the three branches of their &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies, and indeed there cannot be a provincial agent with|out &s;uch appointment. The Whigs &s;oon found that they could not have &s;uch &s;ervices rendered them from a provincial agent, as would an&s;wer their purpo&s;es. The hou&s;e therefore refu&s;ed to join with the other two branches of the general court in the appointment. The hou&s;e cho&s;e an agent for them&s;elves, and the council appointed theirs. Thus we had two agents for private purpo&s;es, and the expence of agency doubled, and with equal rea&s;on a third might have been added as agent for the governor, and the charges have been trebled.</P>
<P>The additional expence was of little con&s;ide|ration, compared with another inconveniency that attended this new mode of agency. The per&s;on appointed by the hou&s;e was the o&s;ten|&s;ible agent of the province, though in fact he was only the agent of a few individuals that had got the art of wielding the hou&s;e at their plea&s;ure. He knew his continuing in office depended upon them. An office that yielded &s;everal thou&s;and pounds &s;terling annually; the bu&s;ine&s;s of which con&s;i&s;ted in little more than attending the levees of the great, and writing letters to America, was worth-pre&s;erving. Thus he was under a
<PB N="28" REF="014158_0028_0F932FD54A01D808">
&s;trong temptation to &s;acrifice the province to a party; and echo back the &s;entiments of his pa|trons.</P>
<P>The advice continually received from one of the per&s;ons, that was thus appointed agent, had great influence upon the members of the hou&s;e of moderate principles. He had pu&s;hed his re&s;earches deep into nature, and made im|portant di&s;coveries; they thought he had done the &s;ame in politicks, and did not admire him le&s;s as a politician than as a philo&s;opher. His intelligence as to the di&s;po&s;ition of his Maje&s;ty, the mini&s;try, the parliament, and the nation in general, was deemed the mo&s;t authentic. He advi&s;ed us to keep up our opposition, to re&s;olve, and re-re&s;olve, to cheri&s;h a military &s;pirit, uni|formly holding up this idea, that if we conti|nued firm we had nothing to fear from the go|vernment in England. He even propo&s;ed &s;ome modes of oppo&s;ition him&s;elf. The &s;pirited mea|&s;ures were always u&s;hered into the hou&s;e with a letter from him. I have been &s;ometimes almo&s;t ready to &s;u&s;pect him of being the <HI>primum mobile,</HI> and to think, that like the man behind the cur|tain at a puppet &s;how, he was playing off the figures here with his own &s;ecret wires. If he ad|vi&s;ed to the&s;e mea&s;ures, contrary to his better knowledge, from &s;ini&s;ter views, and to &s;erve a private purpo&s;e, he has wilfully done the pro|vince an irreparable injury.&mdash;However, I will do him ju&s;tice, he enjoined upon us to refrain from violence, as that would unite the nation again&s;t us; and I am the rather inclined to think that he was deceived him&s;elf with re&s;pect to the mea&s;ures he recommended, as he has already
<PB N="29" REF="014158_0029_0F932FD612827EB0">
felt the re&s;entment of that very government which he told us there was nothing to fear from. This di&s;po&s;ition of the hou&s;e could not have pro|duced &s;uch fatal con&s;equences, had the other two branches of the legi&s;lature retained their con|&s;titutional freedom and influence. They might have been a &s;ufficient check.</P>
<P>The coun&s;ellors depended upon the general a&s;&s;embly for the political exi&s;tence, the Whigs reminded the council of their mortality, if a coun&s;ellor oppo&s;ed the violent mea&s;ures of the Whigs with any &s;pirit, he lo&s;t his election the next May. The council con&s;i&s;ted of twenty- eight. From this principle near half that num|ber, mo&s;tly men of the fir&s;t families, fir&s;t note, abilities, with every po&s;&s;ible attachment to their native country, and as far from temptation as wealth, and independence, could remove them, were tumbled from their &s;eats in di&s;grace. Thus the board which was intended to moderate be|tween the two extremes of prerogative and pri|vilege, lo&s;t its weight in the &s;cale, and the poli|tical balance of the province was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Had the chair been able to retain its own con|&s;titutional influence, the lo&s;s of the board would have been le&s;s felt, but no longer &s;upported by the board that fell likewi&s;e. The governor by the charter could do little, or nothing, without the council. If he called upon a military officer to rai&s;e the militia, he was an&s;wered, they were there already.

<P><PB N="30" REF="014158_0030_0F932FD6CF4CC750">It was not the per&s;on of a Bernard or Hut|chin&s;on that made them obnoxious, any other per&s;on would have met with the &s;ame fate, had they di&s;charged their duty with equal fidelity; that is, had they &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the prin|ciples and practices of the Whigs; and when they found the government here could not &s;up|port it&s;elf, and &s;ent home for aid &s;ufficient to do it. And let me tell you, had the intimations in tho&s;e letters which you are taught to execrate, been tamely attended to, we had now been as happy a people as good government could make us. Governor Bernard came here recommended by the affections of the province, over which he had pre&s;ided. His abilities are acknowledged. His true Briti&s;h hone&s;ty, and punctuality, are traits in his character too &s;trongly marked, to e&s;cape the eye of prejudice it&s;elf. We knew Go|vernor Hutchin&s;on to be amiable and exemplary in private life; his great abilities, integrity and humanity are con&s;picuous in the &s;everal impor|tant departments that he filled, before his ap|pointment to the chair, and reflect honour upon his native country. But his abilities and inte|grity, added to his thorough knowledge of the province, in all its intere&s;ts and connections, were in&s;ufficient in this ca&s;e. The con&s;titution it&s;elf was gone, though the ancient form re|mained; the &s;pirit was truly republican. He endeavoured to reclaim us by gentle means. He &s;trove to convince us by arguments, drawn from the fir&s;t principles of government, our &s;everal charters, and the expre&s;s acknowledgement of our ance&s;tors, that our claims were incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ubordination due to Great-Britain; and
<PB N="31" REF="014158_0031_0F932FD793028BF0">
if per&s;i&s;ted in, would work the de&s;truction of tho&s;e that we were intitled to. For this he was called an enemy to this country, and &s;et up as a mark for the envenomed arrows of malice and party rage. Had I entertained a doubt about its being the governor, and not the man that was aimed at, the admirable facility with which the news-paper abu&s;e was tran&s;mitted from gover|nor Hutchin&s;on, to his amiable &s;ucce&s;&s;or, almo&s;t as &s;oon as he &s;et foot on our &s;hores, would have removed it.</P>
<P>Thus, di&s;affection to Great-Britain being in|fu&s;ed into the body of the people, the &s;ubtle poi|&s;on &s;tole through all the veins and arteries, con|taminated the blood, and de&s;troyed the very &s;ta|mina of the con&s;titution. Had not the courts of ju&s;tice been tainted in the early &s;tages, our go|vernment might have expelled the virus, and re|covered its former vigour by its own &s;trength. The judges of the &s;uperior court were dependent upon the annual grants of the General court, for their &s;upport. Their &s;alaries were &s;mall in pro|portion to the &s;alaries of other officers in the go|vernment of le&s;s importance.</P>
<P>They had often petitioned the a&s;&s;embly to en|large them, without &s;ucce&s;s. They were at this time reminded of their dependance. However, it is but ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that the Judges remained un&s;haken amid&s;t the raging tempe&s;ts, which is to be attributed rather to their firmne&s;s than &s;itua|tion. But the &s;pirit of the times was very ap|parent in the juries. The grand jurors were elective, and in &s;uch places where libels, riots and in&s;urrections were the mo&s;t frequent, the high Whigs got them&s;elves cho&s;en. The Judges
<PB N="32" REF="014158_0032_0F932FD84E6FFBE0">
pointed out to them the &s;editious libels on Go|vernors, Magi&s;trates, and the whole government, to no effect. They were enjoined to pre&s;ent riots and in&s;urrections, of which there was ample evi|dence, with as little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It is difficult to account for &s;o many of the fir&s;t-rate Whigs being returned to &s;erve on the petit jury at the term next after extraordinary in&s;urrection, without &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome legerde|main in drawing their names out of the box. It is certain that notwith&s;tanding &s;warms of the mo&s;t virulent libels infected the province, and there were &s;o many riots and in&s;urrections, &s;carce one offender was indicted, and, I think, not one convicted. Cau&s;es of <HI>meum et tuum</HI> were not al|ways exempt from party influence. The mere circum&s;tance of the Whigs gaining the a&s;cenden|cy over the Tories is trifling. Had the Whigs divided the province between them, as they once flattered them&s;elves they &s;hould be able to do, it would have been of little con&s;equence to the community, had they not cut a&s;under the very &s;inews of government, and broke in pieces the ligaments of &s;ocial life in the attempt. I will mention two in&s;tances which I have &s;elected out of many, of the weakne&s;s of our government, as they are recent and unconnected with acts of parliament. One Malcolm, a loyal &s;ubject, and as &s;uch intitled to protection, the evening before the la&s;t winter &s;e&s;&s;ions of the general court, was dragged out of his hou&s;e, &s;tript, tarred and fea|thered, and carted &s;everal hours in the &s;evere&s;t fro&s;t of that winter, to the utmo&s;t hazard of his life. He was carried to the gallows with a hal|ter about his neck, and in his pa&s;&s;age to and
<PB N="33" REF="014158_0033_0F932FD90D6AB140">
from the gallows, was beaten with as cruel &s;tripes as ever were admini&s;tered by the hands of a &s;a|vage. The whipping, however, kept up the circulation of his blood, and &s;aved the poor man's life. When they had &s;aciated their ma|lice, they di&s;per&s;ed in good order. This was tran&s;acted in the pre&s;ence of thou&s;ands of &s;pec|tators, &s;ome of whom were members of the ge|neral court. Malcom's life was de&s;paired of &s;e|veral days, but he &s;urvived, and pre&s;ented a me|morial to the general a&s;&s;embly, praying their in|terpo&s;ition. The petition was read, and all he obtained was leave to withdraw it. So that he was de&s;titute of protection every hour, until he left the country, as were thou&s;ands be&s;ides, un|til the arrival of the King's troops. This origin|ated from a &s;mall fracas in the &s;treet, wherein Malcom &s;truck, or threatened to &s;trike a per&s;on that in&s;ulted him, with a cutla&s;s, and had no con|nection with the quarrel of the times, unle&s;s his &s;u&s;taining a &s;mall po&s;t in the cu&s;toms made it.</P>
<P>The other in&s;tance is much &s;tronger than this, as it was totally detached from politics. It had been &s;u&s;pected that infection had been commu|nicated from an ho&s;pital, lately erected at Marble|head, for the purpo&s;e of inoculating &s;mall-pox, to the town's people.</P>
<P>This cau&s;ed a great in&s;urrection, the in&s;urgents burnt the ho&s;pital, not content with that, threat|ened the proprietors and many others, &s;ome of the fir&s;t fortunes and characters in the town, with burning their hou&s;es over their heads, and con|tinued parading the &s;treets, to the utmo&s;t terror of the inhabitants, &s;everal days.</P>
<P>A ma&s;&s;acre and general deva&s;tation was ap|prehended.
<PB N="34" REF="014158_0034_0F932FD9D0A8C158">
The per&s;ons threatened, armed them&s;elves, and petitioned the general a&s;&s;embly, which was then &s;itting, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as there was little or no civil authority in the place. A committee was ordered to repair to Marblehead, report the facts, and enquire into the cau&s;e. The committee reported the facts nearly as &s;tated in the petition; the report was accepted, and no|thing further done by the a&s;&s;embly. Such de|mon&s;trations of the weakne&s;s of government in|duced many per&s;ons to join the Whigs, to &s;eek from them that protection which the con&s;titu|tional authority of the province was unable to afford.</P>
<P>Government at home, early in the day, made an effort to check us in our career, and to en|able us to recover from anarchy, without her being driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of altering our pro|vincial con&s;titution, knowing the predeliction that people always have for an ancient form of government. The judges of the &s;uperior court had not been &s;taggered, though their feet &s;tood in &s;lippery places, they depended upon the leading Whigs for their &s;upport. To keep them &s;teady, they were made independent of the grants of the general a&s;&s;embly. But it was not a remedy any way adequate to the di&s;ea&s;e. The Whigs now turned their artillery again&s;t them, and it played bri&s;kly. The Chief Ju&s;tice, for accepting the crown grant, was accu&s;ed of receiving a royal bribe. Thus, my friends, tho&s;e very per&s;ons that had made you believe that every attempt to &s;trengthen government and &s;ave our charter, was an infringement of your privileges; by little and little de&s;troyed your real liberty, &s;ubverted your

charter con&s;titution, abridged the freedom of the hou&s;e, annihilated the freedom of the board, and rendered the governor a mere Doge of Ve|nice. They ingro&s;&s;ed all the power of the pro|vince into their own hands. A democracy or republic I once called it, but it does not de&s;erve the name of either; it was however, a de&s;poti&s;m, cruelly carried into execution by mobs and riots, and more incompatible with the rights of man|kind, than the enormous monarchies of the ea&s;t. The ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the interpo&s;ition of par|liament is apparent. The good policy of the act for regulating the government in this pro|vince, will be the &s;ubject of &s;ome future paper. A particular enquiry into the de&s;poti&s;m of the Whigs will be deferred for a chapter on congre&s;|&s;es. I &s;hall next a&s;k your attention to a tran&s;|action as important in its con&s;equences, and per|haps more &s;o, than any I have yet mentioned, I mean the de&s;truction of the tea, belonging to the Ea&s;t India Company. I am &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty of the ta&s;k, in combating general re|ceived opinions. It is hard work to eradicate deep-rooted prejudices. But I will per&s;evere.

He was favoured not by Whigs or Tories, but the people, with &s;uch a &s;tand in the community, as that he could di&s;tinctly &s;ee all the political ma|noeuvres of the province.

<P>An apprehen&s;ion of inju&s;tice in the conduct of Great-Britain towards us, I have already told
<PB N="37" REF="014158_0037_0F932FDC26DD0150">
you was the &s;ource of our mi&s;ery. La&s;t week I endeavoured to convince you of the nece&s;&s;ity of her regulating, or rather e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome go|vernment among&s;t us. I am now to point out the principles and motives upon which the blockade act was made. It was the violent at|tack upon the property of the Ea&s;t-India Com|pany, in the de&s;truction of their tea. In order to form a right judgement of that tran&s;action, it is nece&s;&s;ary to go back, and view the cau&s;e of its being &s;ent here. As the government of Eng|land is mixed, &s;o the &s;pirit or genius of the na|tion is at once monarchical, ari&s;tocratical, de|mocratical, martial and commercial. It is dif|ficult to determine which is the mo&s;t predomi|nant principle; but it is worthy of remark, that to injure the Briti&s;h nation upon either of the&s;e points, is like injuring a Frenchman in the point of honour. Commerce is the great &s;ource of national wealth, for this rea&s;on it is cheri&s;hed by all orders of men, from the palace to the cot|tage. In &s;ome countries a merchant is held in contempt by the nobles, in England they re&s;pect him. He ri&s;es to high honours in the &s;tate, of|ten contracts alliances with the fir&s;t families in the kingdom, and noble blood flows in the veins of his po&s;terity. Trade is founded upon per&s;ons, or countries, mutually &s;upplying each other with their redundancies. Thus none are empoveri&s;h|ed, all enriched, the a&s;perities of human life worn away, and mankind made happier by it. Hu&s;bandry, manufacture and merchandi&s;e are its treple &s;upport, deprived of either of the&s;e, it would cea&s;e.</P>
<P>Agriculture is the natural livelihood of a
<PB N="38" REF="014158_0038_0F932FDCCC574570">
country but thinly inhabited, as arts and manu|factures are of a opulous one. The high price of labour prevents manufactures being carried on to advantage in the fir&s;t, &s;carcity of &s;oil obliges the inhabitants to pur&s;ue them in the latter. Upon the&s;e, and con&s;iderations ari&s;ing from the fertility, and produce of different clim|ates, and &s;uch like principles, the grand &s;y&s;tem of the Briti&s;h trade is founded. The collected wi&s;dom of the nation has always been attentive to this great point of policy, that the national trade might be &s;o balanced and poi&s;ed, as that each part of her extended dominions, might be benefited, and the whole concentre to the good of the empire. This evinces the nece&s;&s;ity of acts for regulating trade.</P>
<P>To prevent one part of the empire being en|riched at the expence and impoveri&s;hing of an|other, checks, re&s;trictions, and &s;ometimes ab|&s;olute prohibitions are nece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e are im|po&s;ed or taken off as circum&s;tances vary. To carry the acts of trade into execution many of|ficers are nece&s;&s;ity. Thus we &s;ee a number of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers &s;o con&s;tituted as to be checks and controuls upon each other, and pre|vent their &s;werving from their duty, &s;hould they be tempted, and a board of commi&s;&s;ioners ap|pointed to &s;upperintend the whole, like the board of trade in England. Hence al&s;o ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of courts of admiralty.</P>
<P>The laws and regulations of trade are e&s;teem|ed, in England, &s;acred. And an e&s;tate made by &s;muggling, or pur&s;uing an illicit trade, is there looked upon as filthy lucre, as monies ama&s;&s;ed by gaming, and upon the &s;ame principle, becau&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="014158_0039_0F932FDD883F5018">
it is obtained at the expence, and often ruin, of others. The &s;muggler not only injures the pub|lic, but often ruins the fair trader.</P>
<P>The great extent of &s;ea-coa&s;t, many harbours, the variety of i&s;lands, the numerous creeks, and navigable rivers, afford the greate&s;t opportunity to drive an illicit trade in the&s;e colonies without detection. This advantage has not been over|looked by the avaricious, and many per&s;ons &s;eem to have &s;et the laws of trade at defiance; this accounts &s;o far for many new regulations be|ing made, new officers being appointed, and &s;hips of war from time to time &s;tationed along the continent. The way to Holland and back again is well known, and by much the greate&s;t part of tea that has been drank in America, for &s;e|veral years, has been imported from thence, and other places, in direct violation of law. By this the &s;mugglers have ama&s;&s;ed great e&s;tates, to the prejudice of the fair trader. It was &s;en&s;ibly felt at the India Hou&s;e, the Ea&s;t India company were prohibited from exporting their teas to America, they were obliged to &s;ell it by auction in Lon|don; the London merchant purcha&s;ed it, and put a profit upon it, when he &s;hipped it for Ame|rica; the American merchant, in his turn, put a profit upon it and after him, the &s;hop-keeper; &s;o that it came to the con&s;umer's hands at a ve|ry advanced price. Such quantities of tea were annually &s;muggled that it was &s;carcely worth while for the American merchant to import tea from England at all, not becau&s;e the Dutch was u&s;ually &s;old at a lower rate to the con&s;umer, peo|ple in general were no gainers by it, but becau&s;e it le&s;&s;ened the demand for that article. Some of
<PB N="40" REF="014158_0040_0F932FDE48A45760">
the principal trading towns in America were wholly &s;upplied with this commodity by &s;mugg|ling; Bo&s;ton however continued to import it, until advice was received that parliament had it in contemplation to permit the Ea&s;t-India com|pany to &s;end their teas directly to America: the Bo&s;ton merchants then &s;ent their orders condi|tionally to their corre&s;pondents in England, to have tea &s;hipt for them in ca&s;e the Ea&s;t-India company's did not come out; one merchant, a great Whig, had &s;uch an order lying in Eng|land, for &s;ixty che&s;ts, on his own account, when the company's tea was &s;ent. An act of parlia|ment was made to enable the Ea&s;t-India compa|ny to &s;end their tea directly to America, and &s;ell it at auction there, not with a view of rai&s;ing a revenue from the three-penny duty, but to put it out of the power of the &s;mugglers to injure them by their infamous trade.</P>
<P>We have it from good authority, that the re|venue was not the con&s;ideration before parlia|ment, and it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e it, for had that been the point in view, it was only to re&s;tore the former regulation, which was then allowed to be the con&s;titutional, and the revenue would have been re&s;pectable. Had this new regulation taken effect, the people in America would have been great gainers. The whole&s;ale merchant might have been deprived of &s;ome of his gains; but the retailer would have &s;upplied him&s;elf with this article, directly from the auction, and the con&s;umer reap the benefit, as tea would have been &s;old under the price that had been u&s;ual, by near one half. Thus the country in general would have been great gainers, the Ea&s;t-India

company &s;ecured in &s;upplying the American market with this article, which they are en|titled to by the laws of trade, and &s;muggling &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, at lea&s;t as to tea. A &s;muggler and a Whig are cou&s;in Germans, the offspring of two &s;i&s;ters, avarice and ambition. They had been playing into each others hands a long time. The &s;muggler reeeived protection from the Whig, and he in his turn received &s;upport from the &s;muggler. The illicit trader now demands protection from his kin&s;man, and it would have been unnatural in him to have refu&s;ed it, and be&s;ides, an opportunity pre&s;ented of &s;trengthening his own intere&s;t.

A bold &s;troke was re&s;olved upon. The Whigs, though they had got the art of managing the people, had too much &s;en&s;e to be ignorant that it was all a meer fine&s;&s;e, not only without, but directly repugnant to law, con&s;titution and government, and could not la&s;t always.

<P>The next &s;tep was to re&s;olve.&mdash; They re&s;olved, that the tea &s;hould not be landed, nor the duty paid, that it &s;hould go home in the &s;ame bot|tom that it came in, &amp;c. &amp;c. This was the &s;ame as re&s;olving to de&s;troy it, for as the &s;hip had been compelled to come to the wharf, and was entered at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, it could not, by law, be cleared out, without the duties being fir&s;t paid, nor could the governor grant a permit for the ve&s;&s;el to pa&s;s Ca&s;tle-William, without a certificate from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e of &s;uch clear|ance, con&s;i&s;tent with his duty. The body ac|cordingly, ordered a military guard to watch the &s;hip every night until further orders.

them&s;elves. They petitioned the Gover|nor and Council to take the property of the Ea&s;t-India company under their protection. The Council declined being concerned in it. The con&s;ignees then offered the body to &s;tore the tea under the care of the &s;electmen, or a committee of the town of Bo&s;ton, and to have no further concern in the matter until they could &s;end to England, and receive further in&s;tructions from their principals. This was refu&s;ed with di&s;dain. The military guard was regularly kept in rota|tion, till the eve of the twentieth day, when the duties mu&s;t have been paid, the tea landed, or become forfeit; then the military guard was withdrawn, or rather omitted being po&s;ted, and a number of per&s;ons in di&s;gui&s;e, forceably en|tered the &s;hips (three being by this time arrived) &s;plit open the che&s;ts, and emptied all the tea, be|ing of ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling value, into the dock, and perfumed the whole town with its fragrance. Another circum&s;tance ought not to be omitted, the afternoon before the de&s;truction of the tea, the body &s;ent the owner of one of the &s;hips to the Governor, to demand a pa&s;s, he an|&s;wered, that he would as &s;oon give a pa&s;s for that as any other ve&s;&s;el, if he had the proper cer|tificate from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, without which he could not give a pa&s;s for any, con&s;i&s;tent with his duty. It was known that this would be the an&s;wer, when the me&s;&s;age was &s;ent, and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that the body was kept together till the me&s;&s;enger returned. When the report was made, a &s;hout was &s;et up in the galleries and at the door, and the meeting im|mediately di&s;per&s;ed. The governor had, pre|vious

to this, &s;ent a proclamation by the &s;heriff, commanding the body to di&s;per&s;e; they permit|ted it to be read, and an&s;wered it with a general hi&s;s. The&s;e are the facts as truly and fairly &s;tated, as I am able to &s;tate them. The o&s;ten|&s;ible rea&s;on for this conduct, was the tea's being &s;ubject to the three penny duty. Let us take the advocates for this tran&s;action upon their own principle, and admit the duty to be uncon&s;titu|tional, and &s;ee how the argument &s;tands.</P>
<P>Here is a cargo of tea, &s;ubject upon its being entered and landed, to a duty of three-pence per pound, which is paid by the Ea&s;t-India compa|ny or their factors, which amounts to the &s;ame thing. Unle&s;s we purcha&s;e the tea, we &s;hall ne|ver pay the duty, if we purcha&s;e it, we pay the three pence included in the price; therefore, le&s;t we purcha&s;e it, we have no right to de&s;troy it. A flim&s;y pretext! and either &s;uppo&s;es the people de&s;titute of virtue, or that their purcha&s;ing the tea was a matter of no importance to the com|munity; but even this gau&s;e covering is &s;o &s;tript off, when we con&s;ider that the Bo&s;ton mer|chants, and &s;ome who were active at the body meeting, were every day importing from Eng|land&punc; large quantities of tea, &s;ubject to the &s;ame duty, and vending it unmole&s;ted; and at this time had orders lying in their corre&s;pondents hands, to &s;end them con&s;iderable quantities of tea, in ca&s;e the Ea&s;t-India company &s;hould not &s;end it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When the news of this tran&s;action arrived in England, and it was con&s;idered in what manner almo&s;t every other regulation of trade had been evaded by artifice, and when artifice could no

longer &s;erve, recour&s;e was had to violence, the Briti&s;h lion was rou&s;ed. The crown lawyers were called upon for the law, they an&s;wered high trea&s;on. Had a Cromwell, whom &s;ome among&s;t us deify, and imitate in all his imitable perfections, had the guidance of the national ire, unle&s;s compen&s;ation had been made to the &s;uffe|rers immediately, upon its being demanded, your proud capital would have been levelled with the du&s;t, not content with that, rivers of blood would have been &s;hed to make atonement for the injured honour of the nation. It was debated, whether to attaint the principals of trea&s;on. We have a gracious King upon the throne, he felt the re&s;entment of a man, &s;oftened by the relent|ings of a parent. The bowels of our mother country yearned towards her refractory, ob&s;tinate child.</P>
<P>It was determined to con&s;ider the offence in a milder light; and to compel an indemnification for the &s;ufferers, and prevent the like for the fu|ture, by &s;uch means as would be mild, compared with the in&s;ult to the nation, or &s;evere as our fu|ture conduct &s;hould be; that was to depend upon us. Accordingly the blockade act was pa&s;&s;ed, and had an act of ju&s;tice been done in indemni|fying the &s;ufferers, and an act of loyalty in put|ting a &s;top to &s;editious practices, our port had long &s;ince been opened. This act has been cal|led unju&s;t, becau&s;e it involves the innocent in the &s;ame predicament with the guilty, but it ought to be con&s;idered that our news papers had announced to the world, that &s;everal thou&s;ands attended tho&s;e body meetings, and it did not ap|pear that there was one di&s;&s;entient, or any prote&s;t

entered. I do not know how a per&s;on could expect di&s;tinction in &s;uch a ca&s;e, if he neglected to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf. When the noble Lord propo&s;ed in the hou&s;e of commons, he called upon all the members pre&s;ent, to mention a bet|ter method of obtaining ju&s;tice in this ca&s;e, &s;carce one denied the nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;omething, but none could mention a more eligible way. Even mini&s;terial oppo&s;ition was aba&s;hed. If any part of the act &s;trikes us like the &s;everity of a ma&s;ter, let us cooly advert to the aggravated in&s;ult, and perhaps we &s;hall wonder at the lenity of a parent. After this tran&s;action all parties &s;eem to have laid upon their oars, waiting to &s;ee what parlia|ment would do. When the blockade act arrived many and many were de&s;irous of paying for the tea immediately, and &s;ome who were guiltle&s;s of the crime, offered to contribute to the compen|&s;ation, but our leading Whigs mu&s;t &s;till rule the roa&s;t, and that inau&s;picious influence that had brought us hitherto, plunged us &s;till deeper into mi&s;ery. The Whigs &s;aw their ruin connected with a compliance with the terms of opening the port, as it would furni&s;h a convincing proof of the wretchedne&s;s of their policy, in the de|&s;truction of the tea, and they might ju&s;tly been expected to pay the money demanded them&s;elves, and &s;et them&s;elves indu&s;triou&s;ly to work to pre|vent it, and engage other colonies to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e. This was a cri&s;is too important and alarm|ing to the province to be neglected by its friends. A number of as re&s;pectable per&s;ons as any in this province, belonging to Bo&s;ton, Cambridge, Sa|lem, and Marblehead, now came forward, pub|lickly to di&s;avow the proceedings of the Whigs,

to do ju&s;tice to the much injured character of Mr. Hutchin&s;on, and &s;trengthening his influence at the court of Great-Britain, where he was go|ing to receive the well de&s;erved plaudit of his Sovereign, that he might be able to obtain a re|peal, or &s;ome mitigation of that act, the terms of which they fore&s;aw, the perver&s;ene&s;s of the Whigs would prevent a compliance with. This was done by &s;everal addre&s;&s;es, which were &s;ub|&s;cribed by upwards of two hundred per&s;ons, and would have been by many more, had not the &s;ud|den embarkation of Mr. Hutchin&s;on prevented it. The ju&s;tices of the court of common pleas and general &s;e&s;&s;ions of the peace for the county of Plymouth, &s;ent their addre&s;s to him in Eng|land. There were &s;ome of all orders of men among the&s;e addre&s;&s;ers. But they con&s;i&s;ted prin|cipally of men of property, large family connec|tions, and &s;everal were independant in their cir|cum&s;tances, and lived wholy upon the income of their e&s;tates. Some indeed might be called party-men, but a very con&s;iderable proportion were per&s;ons that had of choice kept them&s;elves at a di&s;tance from the political vortex, had be|held the competition of the Whigs and Tories without any commotion, while the community remained &s;afe, had looked down on the political dance in its various mazes and intricacies, and &s;aw one falling, another ri&s;ing, rather as a mat|ter of amu&s;ement; but when they &s;aw the capi|tal of the province upon the point of being &s;a|crificed by political cunning, it called up all their feelings.</P>
<P>Their motives were truly patriotic. Let us now attend to the ways and means by which the
<PB N="48" REF="014158_0048_0F932FE831FE04F8">
Whigs prevented the&s;e exertions producing &s;uch effects. Previous to this, a new, and till lately, unheard of, mode of oppo&s;ition had been devi&s;ed, &s;aid to be the invention of the fertile brain of one of our party agents, called a committee of cor|re&s;pondence. This is the foule&s;t, &s;ubtle&s;t, and mo&s;t venomous &s;erpent that ever i&s;&s;ued from the eggs of &s;edition. The&s;e committees generally con&s;i&s;t of the highe&s;t Whigs, or at lea&s;t there are Whigs among them, that is the ruling &s;pirit of the whole.</P>
<P>They are commonly appointed at thin town meetings, or if the meetings happen to be full, the moderate men &s;eldom &s;peak, or act at all, when this &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s comes on. They have been by much too mode&s;t. Thus the meeting is of|ten prefaced with "At a full meeting," and the &s;everal re&s;olves headed with nem. con. with &s;trict truth, when in fact, but a &s;mall proportion of the town have had a hand in the matter. It is &s;aid that the committee of the town of Bo&s;ton was appointed for a &s;pecial purpo&s;e, and that their commi&s;&s;ions long &s;ince expired. However that may be, the&s;e committees, when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, think them&s;elves amenable to none, they a&s;&s;ume a dictatorial &s;tile, and have an opportunity un|der the apparent &s;anction of their &s;everal towns, of clande&s;tinely wreaking private revenge on in|dividuals, by traducing their characters, and holding them up as enemies to their country wherever they go, as al&s;o, of mi&s;repre&s;enting facts, and propagating &s;edition through the coun|try. Thus a man of principle and property in travelling through the country, would be in&s;ult|ed by per&s;ons who&s;e faces he had never before

&s;een, he would often feel the &s;mart without &s;u&s;|pecting the hand that admini&s;tered the blow. The&s;e committees as they are not known in law, and can derive no authority from thence, lea&s;t they &s;hould not get their &s;hare of power, &s;ome|times engro&s;s it all; they frequently erect them|&s;elves into a tribunal, where the &s;ame per&s;ons are at once legi&s;lator, accu&s;ers, witne&s;&s;es, judges and jurors, and the mob the executioners. The accu&s;ed has no day in court, and the execution of the &s;entence is the fir&s;t notice he receives. This is the channel through which liberty mat|ters have been chiefly conducted the &s;ummer and fall pa&s;t. This accounts for the &s;ame di&s;tem|pers breaking out in different parts of the pro|vince at one and the &s;ame time, which might be attributed to &s;omething &s;upernatural, by tho&s;e that were unacquainted with the &s;ecret conduct of the infection. It is chiefly owing to the&s;e committees, that &s;o many re&s;pectable per&s;ons have been abu&s;ed, and forced to &s;ign recanta|tions and re&s;ignations: That &s;o many per&s;ons, to avoid &s;uch reiterated in&s;ults, as are more to be deprecated by a man of &s;entiment than death it&s;elf, have been obliged to quit their hou&s;es, fa|milies and bu&s;ine&s;s, and fly to the army for pro|tection that hu&s;band has been &s;eparated from wife, father from &s;on, brother from brother, the &s;weet intercour&s;e of conjugal and natural af|fection interrupted, and the unfortunate refugee forced to abandon all the comforts of dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>My countrymen, I beg to pau&s;e and reflect on this conduct, have not the&s;e people that are thus in&s;ulted, as good right to think and act for them|&s;elves

By this means the humane and be|nevolent in various parts of the continent, were induced to advi&s;e us not to comply with the terms for opening our port, and engage to re|lieve us with their charities, from the di&s;tre&s;s that mu&s;t otherwi&s;e fall upon the poor. Their charitable intentions a&s;cend to heaven, like in|cen&s;e from the altar, in &s;weet memorial before the throne of God; but their donations came near proving fatal to the province: It encou|raged the Whigs to per&s;evere in inju&s;tice, and has been the means of &s;educing many an hone&s;t man into the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime that he did not &s;u&s;pect him&s;elf capable of being guilty of.

ought to relieve them from their &s;ufferings, and tho&s;e who by former donations have been the inno|cent cau&s;e of protracting their &s;ufferings, are under a tenfold obligation to a&s;&s;i&s;t them now; and at the &s;ame time to make the mo&s;t explicit decla|rations, that they did not intend to promote, nor ever will join in rebellion. Great allowances are to be made for the cro&s;&s;ings, windings and ter|giver&s;ations of a politician; he is a cunning ani|mal, and as government is &s;aid to be founded in opinion, his tricks may be part of the <HI>arcana im|perandi.</HI> Had our politicians confined them|&s;elves within any rea&s;onable bounds, I never &s;hould have mole&s;ted them; but when I became &s;atisfied, that many innocent, un&s;u&s;pecting per|&s;ons, were in danger of being &s;educed, to their utter ruin, and the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay in danger of being drenched with blood and carnage, I could re&s;train my emotions no lon|ger; and having once broken the bonds of my natural re&s;erve, was determined to probe the &s;ore to the bottom, though I was &s;ure to touch the quick. It is very foreign from my intentions to draw down the vengance of Great-Britain upon the Whigs; they are too valuable a part of the community to lo&s;e, if they will permit them|&s;elves to be &s;aved; I wi&s;h nothing wor&s;e to the highe&s;t of them, than that they may be deprived of their influence, till &s;uch time as they &s;hall have changed their &s;entiments, principles and mea&s;ures. Sedition has already been marked through its zigzag path, to the pre&s;ent times. When the &s;tatute for regulating the government arrived, a match was put to the train, and the mine that had been long forming, &s;prung, and
<PB N="54" REF="014158_0054_0F932FF349BC4F40">
threw the whole province into confu&s;ion and anarchy. The occurrences of the &s;ummer and autumn pa&s;t are &s;o recent and notorious, that a particular hi&s;tory of them is unnece&s;&s;ary. Suf|fice it to &s;ay, that every barrier that civil go|vernment had erected for the &s;ecurity of proper|ty, liberty and life, was broken down, and law, con&s;titution and government, trampled under foot, by the rude&s;t invaders. I &s;hall not dwell upon the&s;e har&s;h notes much longer. I &s;hall yet become an advocate for the leading Whigs; much mu&s;t be allowed to men in their &s;ituation, forcibly actuated by the chagrin of di&s;appoint|ment, the fear of puni&s;hment, and the fa&s;cina|tion of hope at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Perhaps the whole &s;tory of empire does not furni&s;h another in&s;tance of forcible oppo&s;ition to government with &s;o much apparent and little real cau&s;e, with &s;uch apparent probability with|out any po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;tamp-act gave the alarm. The in&s;tability of the public councils from the Grenvillian admini&s;tration, to the appointment of the Earl of Hill&s;borough, to the American department, afforded as great a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, as the heavy duties im|po&s;ed by the &s;tamp-act, did a colour for the op|po&s;ition. It was nece&s;&s;ary to give the hi&s;tory of this matter in its cour&s;e, offend who it would, becau&s;e tho&s;e acts of government that are called the greate&s;t grievances, became proper and ne|ce&s;&s;ary, through the mi&s;conduct of our politi|cians, and the ju&s;tice of Great-Britain towards us, could not be made apparent without fir&s;t pointing out that. I intend to con&s;ider the &s;eve|ral acts of the Briti&s;h government, which are
<PB N="55" REF="014158_0055_0F932FF416414400">
held up as grievances, and enquire whether Great-Britain is chargeable with inju&s;tice in any of them; but mu&s;t fir&s;t a&s;k your attention to the authority of parliament. I &s;u&s;pect many of our politicians are wrong in their fir&s;t principle, in denying that the con&s;titutional authority of par|liament extends to the colonies; if &s;o it mu&s;t not be wondered at, that their whole fabric is &s;o rui|nous: I &s;hall not travel through all the argu|ments that have been adduced, for and again&s;t this que&s;tion, but attempt to reduce the &s;ub|&s;tance of them to a narrow compa&s;s, after hav|ing taken a cur&s;ory view of the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion. The &s;ecurity of the people from internal rapacity and violence, and from foreign inva|&s;ions is the end and de&s;ign of government. The &s;imple forms of government are monarchy, ari&s;|tocracy and democracy, that is, where the au|thority of the &s;tate is ve&s;ted in one, a few, or the many. Each of the&s;e &s;pecies of government has advantages peculiar to it&s;elf, and would an|&s;wer the ends of government, where the per&s;ons intru&s;ted with the authority of the &s;tate always guided them&s;elves by unerring wi&s;dom and pub|lic virtue; but rulers are not always exempt from the weakne&s;s and depravity which make go|vernment nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ociety. Thus monarchy is apt to ru&s;h headlong into tyranny, ari&s;tocracy to beget faction and multiplied u&s;urpations, and democracy to degenerate into tumult, violence and anarchy. A government formed upon the&s;e three principles in due proportion, is the be&s;t calculated to an&s;wer the ends of government, and to endure. Such a government is the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, con&s;i&s;ting of King, Lords, and
<PB N="56" REF="014158_0056_0F932FF501779858">
Commons, which at once includes the principal excellencies, and excludes the principal defects of the other kinds of government. It is allowed, both by Engli&s;hmen and foreigners to be the mo&s;t perfect &s;y&s;tem that the wi&s;dom of ages has produced. The di&s;tributions of power are &s;o ju&s;t, and the proportions &s;o exact, as at once to &s;upport and controul each other. An Engli&s;h|man glories in being &s;ubject to, and protected by, &s;uch a government. The colonies are a part of the Briti&s;h empire. The be&s;t writers upon the law of nations, tell us, that when a nation takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a di&s;tant country, and &s;ettles there, that country though &s;eparated from the principal e&s;tabli&s;hment, or mother country, na|turally becomes a part of the &s;tate, equal with its ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Two &s;upreme or inde|pendant authorities cannot exi&s;t in the &s;ame &s;tate. It would be what is called <HI>imperium in imperio,</HI> the heighth of political ab&s;urdity. The analogy between the political and human bodies is great. Two independant authorities in a &s;tate would be like two di&s;tinct principles of volition and action in the human body, di&s;&s;enting, op|po&s;ing and de&s;troying each other. If then we are a part of the Briti&s;h empire, we mu&s;t be &s;ub|ject to the &s;upreme power of the &s;tate which is ve&s;ted in the e&s;tates of parliament, notwith&s;tand|ing each of the colonies have legi&s;lative and exe|cutive powers of their own, delegated or granted to them, for the purpo&s;es of regulating their own internal police, which are &s;ubordinate to, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ubject to the checks, controul and regulation of the &s;upreme authority of the &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="014158_0057_0F932FF5AA82EB58">This doctrine is not new, but the denial of it is. It is beyond a doubt that it was the &s;en&s;e both of the parent country, and our ance&s;tors, that they were to remain &s;ubject to parliament. It is evident from the charter it&s;elf, and this au|thority has been exerci&s;ed by parliament, from time to time, almo&s;t ever &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment of the country, and has been expre&s;sly acknowledged by our provincial legi&s;latures. It is not le&s;s our intere&s;t than our duty to continue &s;ubject to the authority of parliament, which will be more fully con&s;idered hereafter. The principal argument again&s;t the authority of parliament, is this, the Americans are entitled to all the privileges of an Engli&s;hman, it is the privilege of an Engli&s;hman to be exempt from all laws that he does not con&s;ent to in per|&s;on, or by repre&s;entative; the Americans are not repre&s;ented in parliament, and therefore are exempt from acts of parliament, or in other words, not &s;ubject to its authority. This ap|pears &s;pecious; but leads to &s;uch ab&s;urdities as demon&s;trate its fallacy. If the colonies are not &s;ubject to the authority of parliament, Great-Britain and the colonies mu&s;t be di&s;tinct &s;tates, as compleatly &s;o as England and Scotland were before the union, or as Great-Britain and Ha|nover are now: The colonies in that ca&s;e will owe no allegiance to the imperial crown, and per|haps not to the per&s;on of the King, as the title to the crown is derived from an act of parliament, made &s;ince the &s;ettlement of this province, which act re&s;pects the imperial crown only. Let us wave this difficulty, and &s;uppo&s;e allegiance due from the colonies to the per&s;on of the King of Great-Britain, he then appears in a new capa|city,
<PB N="58" REF="014158_0058_0F932FF6570EE888">
of King of America, or rather in &s;everal new capacities of King of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, King of Rhode-I&s;land, King of Connecticut, &amp;c. &amp;c. For if our connexion with Great-Britain by the parliament be di&s;&s;olved, we &s;hall have none among our&s;elves, but each colony become as di&s;tinct from the others, as England was from Scotland before the Union. Some have &s;uppo&s;|ed that each &s;tate having one and the &s;ame per|&s;on for its Sovereign, is a &s;ufficient connection; where the Sovereign is an ab&s;olute Monarch it might be, but in a mixed government, it is no union at all: For as the King mu&s;t govern each &s;tate by its parliament, tho&s;e &s;everal parliaments would pur&s;ue the particular intere&s;t of its own &s;tate, and however well di&s;po&s;ed the King might be to pur&s;ue a line of intere&s;t that was common to all, the checks and controul that he would meet with, would render it impo&s;&s;ible. If the King of Great-Britain has really the&s;e new ca|pacities, they ought to be added to his titles; and another difficulty will ari&s;e, the prerogatives of the&s;e new crowns have never been defined or limited. Is the monarchical part of the &s;everal provincial con&s;titutions to be nearer or more re|mote from ab&s;olute monarchy, in an inverted ra|tio to each one's approaching to, or receding from a republic. But let us &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame prerogatives inherent in the &s;everal American crowns, as are in the imperial crown of Great-Britain, where &s;hall we find the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion that we all agree we are entitled to. We &s;hall &s;eek for it in vain in our provincial a&s;&s;em|blies. They are but faint &s;ketches of the e&s;tates of parliament. The hou&s;es of repre&s;entatives,
<PB N="59" REF="014158_0059_0F932FF70E39A1D0">
or Burge&s;&s;es, have not all the powers of the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the charter govern|ments they have no more than what is expre&s;sly granted by their &s;everal charters. The fir&s;t charter granted to this province did not impower the a&s;&s;embly to tax the people at all. Our Coun|cil-Boards are as de&s;titute of the con&s;titutional authority of the Hou&s;e of Lords, as their &s;eve|ral members are of the noble independance and &s;plendid appendages of Peerage. The Hou&s;e of Peers is the bulwark of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and through &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages, has with&s;tood the &s;hocks of monarchy, and the &s;appings of De|mocracy, and the con&s;titution gained &s;trength by the conflict. Thus the &s;uppo&s;ition of our be|ing independent &s;tates, or exempt from the au|thority of parliament, de&s;troys the very idea of our having a Briti&s;h con&s;titution. The provin|cial con&s;titutions, con&s;idered as &s;ubordinate, are generally well adapted to tho&s;e purpo&s;es of go|vernment, for which they were intended, that is, to regulate the internal police of the &s;everal co|lonies; but have no principle of &s;tability within them&s;elves, they may &s;upport them&s;elves in mo|derate times, but would be merged by the vio|lence of turbulent ones, and the &s;everal colonies become wholy monarchical, or wholly republican, were it not for the checks, controuls, regulations and &s;upports of the &s;upreme authority of the em|pire. Thus the argument that is drawn from their fir&s;t principle of our being entitled to Eng|li&s;h liberties, de&s;troys the principle it&s;elf, it de|prives us of the Bill of Rights, and all the bene|fits re&s;ulting from the revolution, of Engli&s;h laws, and of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. Our pa|triots
<PB N="60" REF="014158_0060_0F932FF7CDEA83E8">
have been &s;o intent upon building up Ame|rican rights, that they have overlooked the rights of Great-Britain, and our own intere&s;t. In&s;tead of proving that we are entitled to privileges that our fathers knew our &s;ituation would not admit us to enjoy, they have been arguing away our mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights. If there be any grievance it does not con&s;i&s;t in our being &s;ubject to the authority of Parliament, but in our not having an actual repre&s;entation in it. Were it po&s;&s;ible for the colonies to have an equal repre&s;entation in Parliament, and were refu&s;ed it upon proper ap|plication, I confe&s;s I &s;hould think it a grievance; but at pre&s;ent it &s;eems to be allowed by all par|ties, to be impracticable, con&s;idering the colo|nies are di&s;tant from Great-Britain a thou&s;and tran&s;marine leagues. If that be the ca&s;e, the right or privilege that we complain of being de|prived of, is not witheld by Britain, but the fir&s;t principle of government, and the immutable laws of nature, render it impo&s;&s;ible for us to en|joy it. This is apparently the meaning of that celebrated pa&s;&s;age in Governor Hutchin&s;on's let|ter, that rang through the continent, viz. There mu&s;t be an abridgment of what is called Eng|li&s;h liberties. He &s;ubjoins that he had never yet &s;een the projection, whereby a colony three thou|&s;and miles di&s;tant from the parent &s;tate, might enjoy all the privileges of the parent &s;tate, and remain &s;ubject to it, or in words to that effect. The obnoxious &s;entence taken detached from the letter, appears very unfriendly to the colo|nies; but con&s;idered in connexion with the other parts of the letter&punc; it is but a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult from our &s;ituation. Allegiance and protection

are reciprocal. It is our highe&s;t intere&s;t to con|tinue a part of the Briti&s;h empire, and equally our duty to remain &s;ubject to the authority of parliament. Our own internal police may gene|rally be regulated by our provincial legi&s;latures, but in national concerns, or where our own a&s;|&s;emblies do not an&s;wer the ends of government with re&s;pect to our&s;elves, the ordinances or in|terpo&s;ition of the great council of the nation is nece&s;&s;ary. In this ca&s;e the major mu&s;t rule the minor. After many more centuries &s;hall have rolled away, long after we, who are now bu&s;tling upon the &s;tage of life, &s;hall have been received to the bo&s;om of mother earth, and our names are forgotten, the colonies may be &s;o far increa&s;ed as to have the balance of wealth, numbers, and power in their favour, the good of the empire make it nece&s;&s;ary to fix the &s;eat of government here; and &s;ome future GEORGE, equally the friend of mankind with him that now &s;ways the Briti&s;h &s;ceptre, may cro&s;s the Atlantic, and rule Great-Britain by an American Parliament.</P>
<P>Had a per&s;on, &s;ome fifteen years ago, under|taken to prove that the colonies were annexed to the realm, were a part of the Briti&s;h empire or dominion, and as &s;uch &s;ubject to the authori|ty of the Briti&s;h parliament, he would have acted as ridiculous a part, as to have undertaken to prove a &s;elf evident propo&s;ition:&mdash;Had any per&s;on denied it, he would have been called a fool or madman. At this wi&s;e period, individu|als and bodies of men deny it, notwith&s;tanding in doing it they &s;ubvert the fundamentals of go|vernment, deprive us of Briti&s;h liberties, and build up an ab&s;olute monarchy in the colonies;

<P>It is curious indeed to trace the denial and oppugnation to the &s;upreme authority of the &s;tate. When the &s;tamp-act was made, the authority of parliament to impo&s;e internal taxes was denied, but their right to impo&s;e external ones; or in other words, to lay duties upon goods and mer|chandi&s;e was admitted. When the act was made impo&s;ing duties upon tea, &amp;c. a new di&s;tinction was &s;et up, that the parliament had a right to lay duties upon merchandi&s;e for the purpo&s;e of regulating trade, but not for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;|ing a revenue: That is, the parliament had good right and lawful authority, to lay the former du|ty of a &s;hilling on the pound, but had none to lay the pre&s;ent duty of three pence. Having got

thus far &s;afe, it was only taking one &s;tep more to extricate our&s;elves entirely from their fangs, and become independant &s;tates; that our patriots mo&s;t heroically re&s;olved upon, and flatly denied that parliament had a right to make any laws whatever, that &s;hould be binding upon the co|lonies. There is no po&s;&s;ible medium between ab&s;olute independance and &s;ubjection to the au|thority of parliament. He mu&s;t be blind indeed that cannot &s;ee our deare&s;t intere&s;t in the latter notwith&s;tanding many pant after the former, mi&s;guided men!

To deny the &s;upreme authority of the &s;tate is a high mi&s;demeanor, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it; to oppo&s;e it by force is an overt act of trea|&s;on, puni&s;hable by confi&s;cation of e&s;tate, and mo&s;t ignominious death. The realm of England is an appropriate term for the antient realm of England, in contradiction to Wales and other territories that have been annexed to it. The&s;e as they have been &s;everally annexed, whether by conque&s;t or otherwi&s;e, become a part of the Briti&s;h dominions, and &s;ubject to the authority of Parliament, whether they &s;end members to Parliament or not, and whether they have legi&s;|lative powers of their own or not.</P>

Permit me to reque&s;t your attention to this &s;ubject a little longer; I a&s;&s;ure you it is as intere&s;ting and important as it is dry and unentertaining. Let us now recur to the fir&s;t charter of this province, and we &s;hall find irre&s;i&s;tible evidence, that our being a part of the empire, &s;ubject to the &s;upreme authority of the &s;tate, bound by its laws and &s;ubject to its protection, was the very terms and conditions by which our ance&s;tors held their lands and &s;ett|led the province. Our charter, like all other American charters, are in the royal &s;tile, and under the great &s;eal of England; the grants are named by the King, for his heirs and <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</HI> the &s;everal tenures to be of the King, his heirs and <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</HI> in like manner are the re&s;ervations.

<P>Another clau&s;e is this,
<Q>And for their further encouragement, of our e&s;pecial grace and fa|vour, we do by the&s;e pre&s;ents, for us, our heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, yield and grant to the &s;aid governor and company, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and every of them, their factors and a&s;&s;igns, that they and every of them &s;hall be free and quit from all takes, &s;ub&s;idies and cu&s;toms in New-England, for the &s;pace of &s;even years, and from all taxes and impo&s;itions for the &s;pace of twenty-one years, upon all goods and merchandi&s;e, at any time or times hereafter, either upon importation thither, or exporta|tion from thence into our realm of England, or into other of our dominions, by the &s;aid governor and company, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, their deputies, factors and a&s;&s;igns, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The exception of twenty-one years, plainly indicates, that after their expiration, goods and merchandize imported or exported, would be liable to taxes and impo&s;itions, which is rather an unfavourable circum&s;tance for tho&s;e who call the three-penny duty on tea uncon&s;titutional. It is true that this charter has been vacated by a decree in chancery, for the governor and compa|ny a&s;&s;uming powers which they were not inve&s;ted with by it; but it is evidence neverthele&s;s of the terms &s;tipulated between the crown and our an|ce&s;tors, at the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the country. If the province was then &s;ubject to the authority of parliament, it mu&s;t be now, unle&s;s it can be &s;hewn, by &s;ome act of the whole legi&s;lature, that right has been renounced; for it is not in the

prerogatives of the crown to alienate a part of its dominions, excepting the ceding of conquer|ed countries, to obtain a more advantageous peace. I am no advocate for internal taxation, let the right in theory be where it may. It is impracticable in many ca&s;es, perhaps inexpedient in all. The right of parliament to lay duties upon trade, is &s;o intervowen with the right of le|gi&s;lation, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;criminate them, and it is prepo&s;terous to the la&s;t degree, to buoy our&s;elves up with a fal&s;e principle, that mu&s;t fail us in the end, and &s;ink us the deeper for having depended upon it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall recite but one more clau&s;e of this char|ter, which is this,
<Q>And further our will and plea&s;ure is, and we do hereby for us, our heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, ordain, declare and grant to the &s;aid Governor and company, and their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, that all and every of the &s;ubjects of us, our heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, which &s;hall go to, and inhabit within the &s;aid lands and premi&s;es hereby mentioned to be granted, and every of their children which &s;hall happen to be born there, or on the &s;eas in going thither, or re|turning from thence, &s;hall have and enjoy <HI>all liberties and immunities of free and natural &s;ub|jects, within any of the dominions</HI> of us, our heirs or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to all intents, con&s;truc|tions and purpo&s;es what&s;oever, as if they and every of them were born within the realm of England.</Q>
It is upon this, or a &s;imilar clau&s;e in the charter of William and Mary that our pa|triots have built up the &s;tupenduous fabric of American independance. They argue from it a
<PB N="69" REF="014158_0069_0F932FFF4A8BD440">
total exemption from Parliamentary authority, becau&s;e we are not repre&s;ented in parliament.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn that the &s;uppo&s;ition of our being exempt from the authority of parlia|ment, is pregnant with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities. Let us now con&s;ider this clau&s;e in connexion with the other parts of the charter. It is a rule of law, founded in rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, to con&s;true each part, of an in&s;trument, &s;o as the whole may hang together, and be con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. If we &s;uppo&s;e this clau&s;e to exempt us from the authority of parliament, we mu&s;t throw away all the re&s;t of the charter, for every other part indicates the contrary, as plainly as words can do it; and what is &s;till wor&s;e, this clau&s;e becomes <HI>felo de &s;e,</HI> and de&s;troys it&s;elf, for if we are not annexed to the realm, we are aliens, and no charter, grant, or other act of the crown, can naturalize, or entitle us to the liberties and immu|nities of Engli&s;hmen. It can be done only by act of parliament. An alien is one born in a &s;trange country, out of the allegiance of the King, and is under many di&s;abilities, though re|&s;iding in the realm; as Wales, Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Ireland, the foreign plantations, &amp;c. were &s;eve|rally added, or annexed, to the antient realm, they became parts of one and the &s;ame empire, the natives of which are equally free as though they had been born in that territory which was the ancient realm. As our patriots depend upon this clau&s;e, detached from the charter, let us view it in that light. If a per&s;on born in Eng|land removes to Ireland, and &s;ettles there, he is then no longer repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parlia|ment, but he and his po&s;terity are and will ever
<PB N="70" REF="014158_0070_0F9330002E8DD4D8">
be &s;ubject to the authority of the Briti&s;h parlia|ment: If he removes to Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, or any other parts of the Briti&s;h dominions, that &s;end no members to parliament, he will &s;till be in the &s;ame predicament. So that the inhabi|tants of the American colonies do in fact enjoy all the liberties and immunities of natural born &s;ubjects. We are entitled to no greater privi|leges than tho&s;e that are born within the realm, and they can enjoy no other than we do, when they re&s;ide out of it. Thus it is evident that this clau&s;e amounts to no more than the royal a&s;&s;urance, that we are a part of the Briti&s;h em|pire, are not aliens, but natural born &s;ubjects; and as &s;uch bound to obey the &s;upreme power of the &s;tate, and entitled to protection from it. To avoid prolixity I &s;hall not remark particularly upon other parts of this charter, but ob&s;erve in general, that whoever reads it with attention will meet with irre&s;i&s;tible evidence in every part of it, that our being a part of the Engli&s;h dominions, &s;ubject to the Engli&s;h crown, and within the ju|ri&s;diction of parliament, were the terms upon which our ance&s;tors &s;ettled this colony, and the very tenures by which they held their e&s;tates.</P>
<P>No lands within the Briti&s;h dominions are per|fectly allodial; they are held mediately or im|mediately of the king, and upon forfeiture, re|vert to the crown.</P>
<P>My dear countrymen, you have many of you, been mo&s;t fal&s;ly and wickedly told, by our pa|triots, that Great-Britain was meditating a land tax, and &s;eeking to deprive us of our inheritance; but had all the malice and &s;ubtilty of men and devils been united, a readier method to effect it

could not have been devi&s;ed, than the late de|nials of the authority of parliament, and for|cible oppo&s;itions to its acts: Yet, this has been done, planned and executed chiefly by per&s;ons of de&s;perate fortunes.</P>
<P>If we carry our re&s;earches further back than the emigration of our ance&s;tors, we &s;hall find many things that reflect light upon the object we are in que&s;t of. It is immaterial when America was fir&s;t di&s;covered or taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the Engli&s;h. In 1602 one Go&s;nold landed upon one of the i&s;lands, called Elizabeth-I&s;lands, which were &s;o named in honour of Queen Elizabeth, built a fort and projected a &s;ettlement, his men were di&s;couraged, and the project failed. In 1606 King James granted all the continent from 34 to 45 degrees, which he divided into two co|lonies, viz. the &s;outhern, or Virginia, to certain merchants at London, the northern, or New-England, to certain merchants at Plymouth, in England. In 1607 &s;ome of the patentees of the northern colony began a &s;ettlement at Sogadahoc, but the emigrants were di&s;heartened after the tri|al of one winter, and that attempt failed of &s;uc|ce&s;s. Thus this territory has not only been granted by the crown for purpo&s;es of coloniza|tion, which are to enlarge the empire, or domi|nion, of the parent &s;tate, and to open new &s;ources of national wealth, but actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had been taken by the grantees, previous to the emi|gration of our ance&s;tors, or any grant to them. In 1620 a patent was granted to the adventurers for the northern colony, incorporating them by the name of <HI>the council for the affairs of New-Ply|mouth.</HI> From this company of merchants in Eng|land,
<PB N="72" REF="014158_0072_0F933001911BEDB8">
our ance&s;tors derived their title to this ter|ritory. The tract of land called Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was purcha&s;ed of this Company, by Sir Henry Ro&s;well and a&s;&s;ociates, their deed bearing date, March 19th, 1627. In 1628 they obtained a charter of incorporation, which I have already remarked upon. The liberties, privileges and franchi&s;es, granted by this charter, do not per|haps exceed tho&s;e granted to the city of London, and other corporations within the realm. The legi&s;lative power was very confined; it did not even extend to the levying of taxes of any kind, that power was however a&s;&s;umed under this char|ter, which by law worked a forfeiture, and for this, among other things, in the reign of Charles the Second, the charter was adjudged forfeited, and the franchi&s;es &s;eized into the King's hands. This judgment did not affect our an|ce&s;tors title to their lands that was not derived originally from the charter, though confirmed by it, but by purcha&s;e from the council at Ply|mouth, who held immediately under the crown. Be&s;ides our ance&s;tors had now reduced what be|fore was a naked right to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and by per|&s;evering through unequal toils, hard&s;hips and dangers, at the approach of which other emi|grants had fainted, rendered New-England a ve|ry valuable acqui&s;ition, both to the crown and nation. This was highly meritorious, and ought not to be overlooked in adju&s;ting the pre&s;ent un|happy di&s;pute, but our patriots would deprive us of all the merit, both to the crown and na|tion, by &s;evering us from both. After the re|volution, our ance&s;tors petitioned the parliament to re&s;tore the charter. A bill for that purpo&s;e
<PB N="73" REF="014158_0073_0F9330025B126798">
pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of commons, but went no fur|ther. In con&s;equence of another petition King William and Queen Mary granted our pre&s;ent charter, for uniting and incorporating the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, New-Plymouth, and &s;everal other ter|ritories into one province. More exten&s;ive pow|ers of legi&s;lation than tho&s;e contained in the fir&s;t charter were become nece&s;&s;ary, and were granted. And the form of the legi&s;lature made to approach nearer to the form of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature. The powers of legi&s;lation are confined to local or provincial purpo&s;es, and further re&s;tricted by the&s;e words, viz. <HI>So as the &s;ame be not repug|nant, or contrary to the laws of this our realm of England.</HI> Our patriots have made many nice di&s;tinctions and curious refinements, to evade the force of the&s;e words, but after all, it is as im|po&s;&s;ible to reconcile them to the idea of an in|dependant &s;tate, as it is to reconcile di&s;ability to omnipotence. The provincial power of taxation is al&s;o re&s;tricted to provincial purpo&s;es, and al|lowed to be exerci&s;ed over &s;uch only as are inha|bitants, or proprietors, within the province. I would ob&s;erve here, that the granting &s;ubordi|nate powers of legi&s;lation, does not abridge or dimini&s;h the powers of the higher legi&s;latures: thus we &s;ee corporations in England, and the &s;e|veral towns in this province, ve&s;ted with greater or le&s;&s;er powers of legi&s;lation, without the par|liament, in one ca&s;e, or the general court in the other being re&s;trained, from enacting tho&s;e very laws, that fall within the juri&s;diction of the &s;eve|ral corporations. Had our pre&s;ent charter been conceived in &s;uch equivocal terms as that it might be con&s;trued as re&s;training the authori|ty

of parliament, the uniform u&s;age ever &s;ince it pa&s;&s;ed the &s;eal, would &s;atisfy us that its intents was different. The parliament in the reign when it was granted, and in every reign &s;ince, has been making &s;tatutes to extend to the colonies, and tho&s;e &s;tatutes have been as uniformly &s;ub|mitted to as authoritative, by the colonies, till within ten, or a dozen years. Sometimes acts of parliament have been made, and &s;ometimes have been repealed in con&s;equence of petitions from the colonies. The provincial a&s;&s;emblies often refer to acts of parliament in their own, and have &s;ometimes made acts to aid their execution. It is evident that it was the intention of their Ma|je&s;ties, to grant &s;ubordinate powers of legi&s;lation, without impairing or dimini&s;hing the authority of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature. Had there been any words in the charter, that precluded that con|&s;truction, or did the whole taken together, con|tradict it, lawyers would tell us, that their Ma|je&s;ties were deceived in their grant, and the pa|tentees took no e&s;tate by it, becau&s;e the crown can neither alienate a part of the Briti&s;h domi|nions, nor impair the &s;upreme power of the em|pire. I have dwelt longer on this &s;ubject than I at fir&s;t intended, and not by any means done it ju&s;tice, as to avoid prolix narratives, and tedious deduction, I have omitted perhaps more than I have adduced, that evinces the truth of the po|&s;ition, that we are a part of the Briti&s;h domi|nions, and &s;ubject to the authority of parlia|ment. The novelty of the contrary tenets, will appear by extracting a part of a pamphlet, pub|li&s;hed in 1764, by a Bo&s;ton gentleman, who was then the oracle of the Whigs, and who&s;e pro|found

<Q><P>I al&s;o lay it down as one of the fir&s;t prin|ciples from whence I intend to deduce the ci|vil rights of the Briti&s;h colonies, that all of them are &s;ubject to, and dependant on Great-Britain; and that therefore as over &s;ubordi|nate governments, the parliament of Great-Britain has an undoubted power, and lawful authority to make acts for the general good, that by naming them, &s;hall and ought to be equally binding, as upon the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain within the realm. Is there the lea&s;t difference, as to the con&s;ent of the colo|ni&s;ts, whether taxes and impo&s;itions are laid on their trade, and other property by the crown alone, or by the parliament. As it is agreed on all hands, the crown alone cannot impo&s;e them, we &s;hould be ju&s;tifiable in re|fu&s;ing to pay them, <HI>but mu&s;t and ought to yield obedience to an act of parliament, though erro|neous, till repealed.</HI></P>
<P>It is a maxim, that the King can do no wrong; and every good &s;ubject is bound to believe his King is not inclined to do any. We are ble&s;&s;ed with a prince who has given abun|dant demon&s;trations, that in all his actions, he &s;tudies the good of his people, and the true glory of his crown, which are in&s;eparable. It would therefore be the highe&s;t degree of impu|dence and di&s;loyalty, to imagine that the King, at the head of his parliament, could have any but the mo&s;t pure and perfect intentions of ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s and truth, that human na|ture is cap<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> of.

of the King and parliament, in all their acts; even in that which &s;o nearly affects the inte|re&s;ts of the coloni&s;ts; and that a mo&s;t perfect and ready obedience is to be yielded to it, while it remains in force. The power of par|liament is uncontroulable but by them&s;elves, and we mu&s;t obey. They only can repeal their own acts. There would be an end of all government, if one or a number of &s;ubjects, or &s;ubordinate provinces &s;hould take upon them &s;o far to judge of the ju&s;tice of an act of parliament, as to refu&s;e obedience to it. If there was nothing el&s;e to re&s;train &s;uch a &s;tep, prudence ought to do it, for forceably re&s;i&s;t|ing the parliament and the King's laws is high trea&s;on. Therefore let the parliament lay what burdens they plea&s;e on us, we mu&s;t, it is our duty to &s;ubmit and patiently bear them, till they will be plea&s;ed to relieve us.</P></Q>
<P>The Penn&s;ylvania Farmer, who took the lead in explaining away the right of parliament, to rai&s;e a revenue in America, &s;peaking of regulat|ing trade, tells us that
<Q>He who con&s;iders the&s;e provinces as <HI>&s;tates di&s;tinct from the Briti&s;h empire</HI> has very &s;lender notions of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> or of their <HI>intere&s;t</HI>; we are but <HI>parts of the whole,</HI> and therefore there mu&s;t exi&s;t a power &s;ome|where to <HI>pre&s;ide and pre&s;erve the connection in due order.</HI> This power is lodged in parlia|ment, and we are as much <HI>dependant on Great-Britain</HI> as a <HI>perfectly free people can be on an|other.</HI></Q>

<P><PB N="77" REF="014158_0077_0F93300553545188">Having &s;ettled this point, let us reflect upon the re&s;olves and proceedings of our patriots. We often read re&s;olves denying the authority of par|liament, which is the imperial Sovereign, gilded over with profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty to the King; but the golden leaf is too thin to conceal the trea&s;on: It either argues profound ignorance, or hypocri|tical cunning.</P>
<P>We find many un&s;u&s;pecting per&s;ons prevailed on openly to oppo&s;e the execution of acts of par|liament with force and arms. My friends! &s;ome of the per&s;ons that beguiled you, could have turned to the chapter, page and &s;ection, where &s;uch in&s;urrections are pronounced rebellion, by the law of the land; and had not their hearts been dead to a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, and &s;teeled again&s;t eve|ry feeling of humanity, they would have timely warned you of your danger. Our patriots have &s;ent us in pur&s;uit of a mere <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> a fa&s;ci|nating glare, devoid of &s;ub&s;tance; and now, when we find our&s;elves bewildered, with &s;carce one ray of hope to rai&s;e our &s;inking &s;pirits, or &s;tay our fainting &s;ouls, they conjure up phantoms more de|lu&s;ive and fleeting, if po&s;&s;ible, than that which fir&s;t led us a&s;tray. They tell us we are a match for Great-Britain:&mdash;The twentieth part of the &s;trength that Great-Britain could exert, were it nece&s;&s;ary, is more than &s;ufficient to cru&s;h this defencele&s;s province to atoms, notwith&s;tanding all the vapouring of the di&s;affected here and el&s;e|where. They tell us the army is di&s;affected to the &s;ervice: What pains have our wretched po|liticians not taken to attach them to it? The of|ficers conceive no very favourable opinion of the cau&s;e of the Whigs, from the obloquy with
<PB N="78" REF="014158_0078_0F9330061F38AD00">
which the general hath been treated, in return for his humanity, nor from the infamous attempts to &s;educe the &s;oldiers from his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. The policy of &s;ome of our patriots has been as weak and contemptible as their motives are &s;or|did and malevolent, for when they found their &s;ucce&s;s, in corrupting the &s;oldiery, did not an|&s;wer their expectations, they took pains to at|tach them firmer to the cau&s;e they adhered to, by preventing the erecting of barracks for their winter quarters, by which means many contract|ed di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;ome lives were lo&s;t, from the unwhole&s;ome buildings they were obliged to oc|cupy; and, as though &s;ome &s;timulus was &s;till wanting, &s;ome provocation to prevent human nature revolting in the hour of battle, they de|prived the &s;oldiers of a gratification never denied to the brute creation,&mdash;&s;traw to lie on. I do not mention this conduct to rai&s;e the re&s;entment of the troops, it has had its effect already, and it is proper you &s;hould know it; nor &s;hould I have blotted paper in relating facts &s;o mortifying to the pride of man, had it not been ba&s;ely &s;ug|ge&s;ted that there would be a defection &s;hould the army take the field. Tho&s;e are matters of &s;mall moment compared to another, which is the cau&s;e they are engaged in. It is no longer a &s;truggle between Whigs and Tories, whether the&s;e or tho&s;e &s;hall occupy po&s;ts of honour, or enjoy the emoluments of office, nor is it now whether this or the other act of parliament &s;hall be repealed. The army is &s;ent here to decide a que&s;tion, inti|mately connected with the honour and intere&s;t of the nation, no le&s;s than whether the colonies &s;hall continue a part of, or be forever di&s;mem|bered

from the Briti&s;h empire. It is a cau&s;e in which no hone&s;t American, can wi&s;h our politi|cians &s;ucce&s;s, though it is devoutly to be wi&s;hed, that their di&s;comfiture may be effected without recour&s;e being had to the <HI>ultima ratio</HI>&mdash;the &s;word. This our wretched &s;ituation is but the natural con&s;equence of denying the authority of parlia|ment, and forcibly oppo&s;ing its acts.</P>
<P>Sometimes we are amu&s;ed with intimations that Holland, France or Spain will make a di|ver&s;ion in our favour.&mdash;The&s;e, equally with the others, are &s;ugge&s;tions of de&s;pair. The&s;e powers have colonies of their own, and might not choo&s;e to &s;et a bad example, by encouraging the colo|nies of any other &s;tate to revolt. The Dutch have too much money in the Engli&s;h funds, and are too much attached to their money to e&s;pou&s;e our quarrel. The French and Spaniards have not yet forgot the drubbing they received from Great-Britain la&s;t war; and all three fear to of|fend that power which our politicians would per|&s;uade us to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, they tell us that the people in England will take our part, and prevent matters from coming to extremity. This is their fort, where, when driven from every other po&s;t, they fly for refuge.</P>
<P>Alas! my friends, our congre&s;&s;es have &s;topt up every avenue that leads to that &s;anctuary. We hear by every arrival from England, that it is no longer a mini&s;terial (if ever it was) but a natio|nal cau&s;e.

Have not our congre&s;&s;es, county, provincial and continental, in&s;tead of making advances for an accommodation, bid defiance to Great-Britain?&mdash;<HI>He that runs may read.</HI></P>
<P>If our politicians will not be per&s;uaded from running again&s;t the thick bo&s;&s;es of the buckler, it is time for us to leave them to their fate, and provide for the &s;afety of our&s;elves, our wives, our children, our friends and our country.</P>
<P>I have many things to add, but mu&s;t now take my leave for this week, by &s;ubmitting to your judgment whether there be not an ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity of immediately prote&s;ting again&s;t all trai|terous re&s;olves, leagues and a&s;&s;ociations, of bo|dies of men that appear to have acted in a repre|&s;entative capacity. Had our congre&s;&s;es been ac|cidental or &s;pontaneous meetings, the whole blame might have re&s;ted upon the individuals that compo&s;ed them, but as they appear in the character of the peoples delegates, is there not the utmo&s;t danger of the innocent being con|founded with the guilty, unle&s;s they take care timely to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves?</P>
<P>As the oppugnation to the King in parliament tends manife&s;tly to independance, and the colo|nies would &s;oon arrive at that point, did not Great Britain check them in their carreer; let us indulge the idea, however extravagant and ro|mantic, and &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves for ever &s;eparated from the parent &s;tate. Let us &s;uppo&s;e Great-Bri|tain &s;inking under the violence of the &s;hock, and

overwhelmed by her ancient hereditary enemies; or what is more probable, opening new &s;ources of national wealth, to &s;upply the deficiency of that which u&s;ed to flow to her through Ameri|can channels, and perhaps planting more loyal colonies in the new di&s;covered regions of the &s;outh, &s;till retaining her preeminence among the nations, though regardle&s;s of America.</P>
<P>Let us now advert to our own &s;ituation. De&s;|titute of Briti&s;h protection, that impervious bar|rier, behind which in perfect &s;ecurity, we have encrea&s;ed to a degree almo&s;t exceeding the bounds of probability, what other Britain could we look to when in di&s;tre&s;s? What &s;uccedaneum does the world afford to make good the lo&s;s? Would not our trade, navigation and fi&s;hery, which no nation in Europe dares violate or in|vade, when di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Briti&s;h colours, become the &s;port and prey of the maritime pow|ers of Europe? Would not our maritime towns be expo&s;ed to the pillaging of every piratical en|terprize? Are the colonies able to maintain a fleet, &s;ufficient to afford one idea of &s;ecurity to &s;uch an exten&s;ive &s;ea-coa&s;t? Before they can de|fend them&s;elves again&s;t foreign inva&s;ions, they mu&s;t unite into one empire, otherwi&s;e the jar|ring intere&s;ts, and oppo&s;ite propen&s;ities, would render the many headed mon&s;ter in politics, un|wieldy and inactive. Neither the form or &s;eat of government would be readily agreed upon; more difficult &s;till would it be to fix upon the per&s;on or per&s;ons, to be inve&s;ted with the impe|rial authority. There is perhaps as great a di|ver&s;ity between the tempers and habits of the inhabitants of this province, and the tempers
<PB N="82" REF="014158_0082_0F9330092E54CF30">
and habits of the Carolinians, as there &s;ub&s;i&s;t between &s;ome different nations; nor need we travel &s;o far, the Rhode-I&s;landers are as diver&s;e from the people of the adjoining colony of Connecticut, as tho&s;e mentioned before. Mo&s;t of the colonies are rivals to each other in trade. Between others there &s;ub&s;i&s;t deep animo&s;ities, re|&s;pecting their boundaries, which have hereto|fore produced violent altercations, and the &s;word of civil war has been more than once un&s;heath|ed, without bringing the&s;e di&s;putes to a deci&s;ion. It is apparent that &s;o many di&s;cordant, hetero|genius particles could not &s;uddenly unite and con&s;olidate into one body: It is mo&s;t probable, that if ever they were united, the union would be effected by &s;ome a&s;piring genius, putting him&s;elf at the head of the coloni&s;ts army (for we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a very re&s;pectable one indeed before we are &s;evered from Britain) and taking advantage of the enfeebled, bleeding and di&s;tracted &s;tate of the colonies, &s;ubjugate the whole to the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m. Human nature is every where the &s;ame, and this has often been the i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e rebellions that the rightful Prince was unable to &s;ubdue. We need not travel through the &s;tates of ancient Greece and Rome, or the more modern ones in Europe, to pick up the in&s;tances, with which the way is &s;trewed; we have a no|table one in our own. So odious and arbitrary was the protectorate of Cromwell, that when death had delivered them from the dread of the tyrant, all parties con&s;pired to re&s;tore monarchy, and each one &s;trove to be foremo&s;t in inviting home, and placing upon the imperial throne,

their exiled prince, the &s;on of the &s;ame Charles, who not many years before, had died on the &s;caf|fold: The republicans them&s;elves now ru&s;hed to the oppo&s;ite extreme, and had Charles the &s;econd been as ambitious, as &s;ome of his predece&s;&s;ors were, he might have e&s;tabli&s;hed in England a power more arbitrary than the fir&s;t Charles ever had in contemplation.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;uppo&s;e the colonies united and moulded into &s;ome form of government. Think one moment of the revenue nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport this government, and to provide for even the appearance of defence. Conceive your&s;elves in a manner exhau&s;ted by the conflict with Great-Britain, now &s;taggering and &s;inking under the load of your own taxes, and the weight of your own government. Con&s;ider further, that to ren|der government operative and &s;alutary, &s;ubordi|nation is nece&s;&s;ary. This our patriots need not be told of, and when once they had mounted the &s;teed, and found them&s;elves &s;o well &s;eated as to run no ri&s;k of being thrown from the &s;addle, the &s;everity of their di&s;cipline to re&s;tore &s;ubordina|tion, would be in proportion to their former treachery in de&s;troying it. We have already &s;een &s;pecimens of their tyranny, in their inhu|man treatment of per&s;ons guilty of no crime, ex|cept that of differing in &s;entiment from the whigs.

<P>To elude the difficulty re&s;ulting from our de|fencele&s;s &s;ituation, we are told that the colonies would open a free trade with all the world, and all nations would join in protecting their com|mon mart. A very little reflection will convince

us, that this is chimerical. American trade, how|ever beneficial to Great-Britain, while &s;he can command it, would be but as a drop of the bucket, or the light du&s;t of the balance, to all the commercial &s;tates of Europe: Be&s;ides, were the Briti&s;h fleets and armies no longer de&s;tined to our protection, in a very &s;hort time France and Spain would recover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e territories, that were torn reluctant and bleeding from them, in the la&s;t war, by the &s;uperior &s;trength of Bri|tain. Our enemies would again extend their line of fortification, from the northern to the &s;outh|ern &s;hore, and by means of our late &s;ettlements &s;tretching them&s;elves to the confines of Canada, and the communication opened from one country to the other, we &s;hould be expo&s;ed to perpetual incur&s;ions from Canadians and &s;avages; but our di&s;tre&s;s would not end here, for when once the&s;e incur&s;ions &s;hould be &s;upported by the formi|dable armaments of France and Spain, the whole continent would become their ea&s;y prey, and would be parcelled out, Poland like. Recollect the con&s;ternation we were thrown into la&s;t war, when fort William Henry was taken by the French: It was apprehended that New-England would be over-run by their conquering arms: It was even propo&s;ed, for our own people to burn and lay wa&s;te all the country we&s;t of Connecticut river, to impede the enemies march, and prevent their ravaging the country ea&s;t of it.

from tho&s;e powers, that have long beheld us with the &s;harp piercing eyes of avidity, and have heretofore bled freely, and expended their millions to obtain us? Do you &s;uppo&s;e their lu&s;t of empire is &s;atiated? Or do you &s;uppo&s;e, they would &s;corn to obtain &s;o glorious a prize by an ea&s;y conque&s;t? Or can any be &s;o vi&s;iona|ry and enthu&s;ia&s;tical as to believe that the Father of the univer&s;e will work miracles in favour of rebellion? And after having, by &s;ome un&s;een arm, and mighty power, de&s;troyed Great-Bri|tain for us, will in the &s;ame my&s;terious way de|fend us again&s;t other European powers? Some|times we are told, that the colonies may put them|&s;elves under the protection of &s;ome one foreign &s;tate, but it ought to be con&s;idered that to do that, we mu&s;t throw our&s;elves into their power. We can make them no return for protection but by trade, and of that they can have no a&s;&s;urance, unle&s;s we become &s;ubject to their laws; this is evident by our contention with Britain.</P>
<P>Which &s;tate would you prefer being annexed to, France, Spain or Holland? I &s;uppo&s;e the latter, as it is a republic; but are you &s;ure that the other powers of Europe would be idle &s;pec|tators, content to &s;uffer the Dutch to ingro&s;s the American colonies, or their trade? And what figure would the Dutch probably make in the unequal conte&s;t? Their &s;word has been long &s;ince &s;heathed in commerce. Tho&s;e of you that have vi&s;ited Surinam, and &s;een a Dutch Gover|nor di&s;pen&s;ing, at di&s;cretion, his own opinions for law, would not &s;uddenly exchange the Eng|li&s;h for Dutch government.</P>
<P>I will &s;ubjoin &s;ome ob&s;ervations from the

Farmer's letters. "When the appeal is made to the &s;word, highly probable it is, that the puni&s;h|ment will exceed the offence, and the calamities attending on war outweigh tho&s;e preceding it. The&s;e con&s;iderations of ju&s;tice and prudence, will always have great influence with good and wi&s;e men. To the&s;e reflections it remains to be added, and ought for ever to be remembered, that re|&s;i&s;tance in the ca&s;e of the colonies again&s;t their mother-country, is extremely different from the re&s;i&s;tance of a people again&s;t their prince: A na|tion may change their King, or race of Kings, and retaining their ancient form of government be gainers by changing. Thus Great-Britain under the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, a hou&s;e that &s;eems to flouri&s;h for the happine&s;s of mankind, has found a felicity unknown in the reigns of the Stewarts; but if once we are &s;eparated from our mother country, what new form of government &s;hall we adopt, or where &s;hall we find another Britain to &s;upply our lo&s;s? Torn from the body to which we are united by religion, laws, affec|tion, relation, language and commerce, we mu&s;t bleed at every vein. In truth, the pro&s;perity of the&s;e provinces is founded in their dependance on Great-Britain."</P>
<P>Thus, not only our allegiance binds us to obey acts of parliament, but every civil and religious privilege we enjoy depends upon it. I &s;hall next enquire into tho&s;e acts that are called grievances. I do not know that I could wi&s;h that Great-Bri|tain &s;hould appear altogether blamele&s;s, but I a&s;&s;ure you, we &s;hall find nothing to ju&s;tify the conduct of our patriots.</P>
