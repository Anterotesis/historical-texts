<HEAD>THE AGE OF REASON.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been my intention, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, to publi&s;h my thoughts upon religion. I am well aware of the difficulties that attend the &s;ubject; and, from that con&s;ideration, had re&s;erved it to a more advanced period of life. I intended it to be the la&s;t offering I &s;hould make to my fellow citizens of all nations; and that, at a time, when the purity of the motive that induced me to it, could not admit of a que&s;tion, even by tho&s;e who might di&s;approve the work.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance that has now taken place in France, of the total abolition of the whole national order of prie&s;t|hood, and of every thing appertaining to compul&s;ive &s;y&s;|tems of religion, and compul&s;ive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly nece&s;&s;ary; le&s;t, in the general wreck of &s;uper&s;tition, of fal&s;e &s;y&s;tems of government, and fal&s;e theology, we lo&s;e &s;ight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.</P>
<P>As &s;everal of my colleagues, and others of my fel|low citizens of France, have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual profe&s;&s;ion of faith, I al&s;o will make mine; and I do this with all that &s;in|cerity
<PB N="4" REF="027458_0003_0FD3D92ED80C0568">
and frankne&s;s with which the mind of man commu|nicates with it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happine&s;s beyond this life.</P>
<P>I believe the equality of man, and I believe that re|ligious duties con&s;i&s;t in doing ju&s;tice, loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow creatures happy.</P>
<P>But, le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that I believe many other things in addition to the&s;e, I &s;hall, in the progre&s;s of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my rea&s;ons for not believing them.</P>
<P>I do not believe in the creed profe&s;&s;ed by the Jew|i&s;h church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turki&s;h church, by the Prote&s;tant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.</P>
<P>All national in&s;titutions of churches, whether Jew|i&s;h, Chri&s;tian, or Turki&s;h, appear to me no other than human inventions &s;et up, to terrify and en&s;lave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.</P>
<P>I do not mean by this declaration to condemn tho&s;e who believe otherwi&s;e. They have the &s;ame right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of man, that he be mentally faithful to him&s;elf Infidelity does not con&s;i&s;t in believing, or in di&s;believing: it con&s;i&s;ts in profe&s;&s;ing to believe what he does not be|lieve.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate the moral mi&s;chief, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, that mental lying has produced in &s;ociety. When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man has &s;o far corrupted and pro&s;ti|tuted the cha&s;tity of his mind, as to &s;ub&s;cribe his profe&s;|&s;ional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared him&s;elf for the commi&s;&s;ion of every other crime. He takes up the trade of a prie&s;t for the &s;ake of gain, and in order to <HI>qualify</HI> him&s;elf for that trade, he begins with perjury.</P>
<P>Can we conceive anything more de&s;tructive to moral|ity than this?</P>
<P>Soon after I had publi&s;hed the pamphlet, COMMON SENSE, in America, I &s;aw the exceeding probabili|ty
<PB N="5" REF="027458_0004_0FD3D931787487A8">
that a Revolution in the Sy&s;tem of Government would be followed by a Revolution in the Sy&s;tem of Religion. The adulterous connection of church and &s;tate, wherever it had taken place, whether Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;tian or Turki&s;h, had &s;o effectually prohibited, by pains and penalties, every di&s;cu&s;&s;ion upon e&s;tabli&s;hed creeds, and upon fir&s;t princi|ples of religion, that until the &s;y&s;tem of government &s;hould be changed, tho&s;e &s;ubjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world: but that whenever this &s;hould be done, a revolution in the &s;y&s;tem of religion would fol|low. Human inventions and prie&s;t-craft would be de|tected, and man would return to the pure unmixed and unadulterated belief of one God, and no more.</P>
<P>Every national church or religion has e&s;tabli&s;hed it|&s;elf by pretending &s;ome &s;pecial mi&s;&s;ion from God com|municated to certain individuals. The Jews have their Mo&s;es; The Chri&s;tians their Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their apo&s;tles and &s;aints; and the Turks their Mahomet; as if the way to God was not open to every man alike.</P>
<P>Each of tho&s;e churches &s;how certain books which they call <HI>revelation,</HI> or the word of God. The Jews &s;ay that their word of God was given by God to Mo&s;es face to face; the Chri&s;tians &s;ay, that their word of God came by divine in&s;piration; and the Turks &s;ay, that their word of God (the Koran) was brought by an angel from heaven. Each of tho&s;e churches accu&s;es the other of unbelief; and, for my own part, I di&s;believe them all.</P>
<P>As it is nece&s;&s;ary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the &s;ubject, offer &s;ome ob|&s;ervations on the word <HI>revelation.</HI> Revelation, when applied to religion, means &s;omething communicated <HI>imme|diately</HI> from God to man.</P>
<P>No one w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> deny or di&s;pute the power of the Al|mighty to make &s;uch a communication if he plea&s;es. But admitting, for the &s;ake of a ca&s;e, that &s;omething has been revealed to a certain per&s;on, and not revealed to any other per&s;on, it is revelation to that per&s;on only. When he tells to a &s;econd per&s;on, a &s;econd to a third, a third to a fourth, and &s;o on, it cea&s;es to be a revelation to all tho&s;e per&s;ons. It is revelation to the fir&s;t per&s;on
<PB REF="027458_0005_0FD3D9318053FC00">
only, and <HI>hear-&s;ay</HI> to every other; and con&s;equently they are not obliged to believe it.</P>
<P>It is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call any thing a revelation that comes to us at &s;econd hand, either verbally or in writing. Revelation is nece&s;&s;arily limit|ted to the fir&s;t communication. After this, it is only an account of &s;omething which that per&s;on &s;ays was a re|velation made to him; and though he may find him&s;elf obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent upon me to believe it in the &s;ame manner, for it was not a revela|tion made to <HI>me,</HI> and I have only his word for it that it was made to <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>When Mo&s;es told the children of I&s;rael that he re|ceived the two tables of the commandments from the hand of God, they were not obliged to believe him, be|cau&s;e they had no other authority for it than his telling them &s;o; and I have no other authority for it than &s;ome hi&s;torian telling me &s;o. The commandments carry no internal evidence of divinity with them. They contain &s;ome good moral precepts, &s;uch as any man qualified to be a lawgiver or a legi&s;lator could produce him&s;elf, with|out having recour&s;e to &s;upernatural intervention.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to except the declaration, which &s;ays, that God <HI>vi&s;its the &s;ins of the fathers upon the children.</HI> It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> contrary to every principle of moral ju&s;tice.</NOTE></P>
<P>When I am told that the Koran was written in heaven, and brought to Mahomet by an angel, the ac|count comes to near the &s;ame kind of hear&s;ay evidence, and &s;econd hand authority, as the former. I did not &s;ee the angel my&s;elf, and therefore have a right not to believe it.</P>
<P>When al&s;o I am told that a woman, called the Vir|gin Mary, &s;aid, or gave out that &s;he was with child with|out any cohabitation, with a man, and that her betrothed hu&s;band, Jo&s;eph, &s;aid, that an angel told him &s;o, I have a right to believe them or not; &s;uch a circum&s;tance re|quired a much &s;tronger evidence than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bare word for it; but we have not even this; for neither Jo&s;eph nor Mary wrote any &s;uch matter them&s;elves. It is only reported by others that <HI>they &s;aid &s;o.</HI> It is hear&s;ay upon
<PB N="7" REF="027458_0006_0FD3D932D54C58C8">
hear&s;ay, and I do not chu&s;e to re&s;t my belief upon &s;uch evidence.</P>
<P>It is, however, not difficult to account for the cred|it that was given to the &s;tory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t being the Son of God. He was born at a time when the heathen mythology had &s;till &s;ome fa&s;hion and repute in the world, and that mythology had prepared the people for the be|lief of &s;uch a &s;tory. Almo&s;t all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen mythology were reputed to be the &s;ons of &s;ome of their gods. It was not a new thing at that time to believe a man to have been cele&s;|tially begotten; the intercour&s;e of gods with women was then a matter of familiar opinion. Their Jupiter, ac|cording to their accounts, had cohabited with hundreds: the &s;tory, therefore, had nothing in it, either new, won|derful or ob&s;cene: it was conformable to the opinions that then prevailed among the people called Gentiles, or mythologi&s;ts, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e people only that believed it. The Jews who had kept &s;trictly to the belief of one God, and no more, and who had always rejected the heathen mythology, never credited the &s;tory.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve how the theory of what is called the Chri&s;tian church, &s;prung out of the tail of the heathen mythology. A direct incorporation took place in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, by making the reputed found|er to be cele&s;tially begotten. The trinity of Gods that then followed was no other than a reduction of the form|er plurality, which was about twenty or thirty thou&s;and. The &s;tatue of Mary &s;ucceeded the &s;tatue of Diana of Ephe&s;us. The deification of heroes changed into the cannonization of &s;aints. The mythologi&s;ts had gods for every thing; the Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts had &s;aints for every thing. The church became as crouded with the one, as the pantheon had been with the other; and Rome was the place of both. The Chri&s;tian theory is little el&s;e than the idolatry of the ancient mythologi&s;ts ac|commodated to the purpo&s;es of power and revenue; and it yet remains to rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy to aboli&s;h the amphibious fraud.</P>
<P>Nothing that is here &s;aid can apply, even with the mo&s;t di&s;tant re&s;pect, to the real character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t&punc;
<PB N="8" REF="027458_0007_0FD3D95B088993D0">
He was virtuous and an amiable man. The morality that he preached and practi&s;ed was of the mo&s;t benevo|lent kind; and though &s;imilar &s;y&s;tems of morality had been preached by Confucius, and by &s;ome of the Greek philo&s;ophers, many years before, by the Quakers &s;ince, and by many good men in all ages, it has not been ex|ceeded by any.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e no account of him&s;elf, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> birth, parentage, or any thing el&s;e. Not a line of what is called the New Te&s;tament is of his writing. The hi&s;tory of him is altogether the work of other people; and as to the account given of his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen|&s;ion, it was the nece&s;&s;ary counterpart to the &s;tory of his birth. His hi&s;torians having brought him into the world in a &s;upernatural manner, were obliged to take him out again in the &s;ame manner, or the fir&s;t part of the &s;tory mu&s;t have fallen to the ground.</P>
<P>The wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told, exceeds every thing that went before it. The fir&s;t part, that of the miraculous conception, was not a thing that admitted of publicity; and therefore the tellers of this part of the &s;tory had this advantage, that though they might not be credited, they could not be de|rected. They could not be expected to prove it, becau&s;e it was not one of tho&s;e things that admitted of proof, and it was impo&s;&s;ible that the per&s;on of whom it was told could prove it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the re&s;urrection of a dead per&s;on from the grave, and his a&s;een&s;ion through the air, is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits of, to the invi&s;ible conception of a child in the womb. The re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;ing them to have taken place, ad|mitted of public and occular demon&s;tration, like that of the a&s;cen&s;ion of a balloon, or the &s;un at noon day, to all Jeru&s;alem at lea&s;t. A thing which every body is re|quired to believe, requires that the proof and evidence of it &s;hould be equal to all, and univer&s;al; and as the public vi&s;ibility of this la&s;t related act was the only evidence that could give &s;anction to the former part, the whole of it falls to the ground, becau&s;e the evidence never was giv|en: In&s;tead of this, a &s;mall number of per&s;ons, not
<PB N="9" REF="027458_0008_0FD3D95C8C08B810">
more than eight or nine, are introduced as proxies for the whole world, to &s;ay they <HI>&s;aw it,</HI> and all the re&s;t of the world are called upon to believe it. But it appears that Thomas did not believe the re&s;urrection; and, as they &s;ay, would not believe without having occular and manual demon&s;tration him&s;elf. <HI>So neither will I;</HI> and the rea&s;on is equally as good for me and for every other per&s;on as for Thomas.</P>
<P>It is in vain to attempt to palliate or di&s;gui&s;e this matter The &s;tory &s;o far as relates to the &s;upernatural part, has every mark of fraud and impo&s;ition &s;tamped up|on the face of it. Who were the authors of it, is im|po&s;&s;ible for us now to know, as it is for us to be a&s;&s;ur|ed, that the books in which the account is related, were written by the per&s;ons who&s;e names they bear. The be&s;t &s;urviving evidence we have re&s;pecting this af|fair is the Jews. They are regularly de&s;cended from the people who lived in the times this re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion is &s;aid to have happened, and they &s;ay <HI>it is not true.</HI> It has long appeared to me a &s;trange incon|&s;i&s;tency to cite the Jews, as a proof of the truth of the &s;tory. It is ju&s;t the &s;ame as if a man were to &s;ay, I will prove the truth of what I have told you, by producing the people who &s;ay it is fal&s;e.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t exi&s;ted, and that he was crucified, which was the mode of execution at that day, are hi&s;torical relations &s;trictly within the limits of probability. He preached mo&s;t excellent mo|rality, and the equality of man; but he preached al&s;o again&s;t the corruptions and avarice of the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts; and this brought upon him the hatred and vengeance of the whole order of prie&s;thood. The accu&s;a|tion which tho&s;e prie&s;ts brought again&s;t him, was that of &s;edition and con&s;piracy again&s;t the Roman government, to which the Jews were then &s;ubject and tributary; and it is not improbable that the Roman gov|ernment might have &s;ome &s;ecret apprehen&s;ion of the ef|fects of his doctrine as well as the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts; neither is it improbable that Je&s;us Chri&s;t had in contemplation the delivery of the Jewi&s;h nation from the bondage of
<PB N="10" REF="027458_0009_0FD3D95E0B9D09A8">
the Romans. Between the two, however, this virtuous reformer and revolutioni&s;t lo&s;t his life.</P>
<P>It is upon this plain narrative of facts, together with another ca&s;e I am going to mention, that the Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts, calling them&s;elves the chri&s;tian church, have erected their fable, which, for ab&s;urdity and extrav|agance is not exceeded by any thing that is to be found in the mythology of the ancients.</P>
<P>The ancient mythologi&s;ts tell that the race of Gi|ants made war again&s;t Jupiter, and that one of them threw an hundred rocks again&s;t him at one throw; that Jupiter defeated him with thunder, and confined him af|terwards under Mount Etna: and that every time the Giant turns him&s;elf, Mount Etna belches fire. It is here ea&s;y to &s;ee that the circum&s;tance of the mountain, that of its being a vulcano, &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of the fable; and that the fable is made to fit and wind it&s;elf up with that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts tell that their Satan made war again&s;t the Almighty, who defeated him, and con|find him afterwards, not under a mountain, but in a pit. It is here ea&s;y to &s;ee that the fir&s;t fable &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of the &s;econd; for the fable of Jupiter and the Giants was told many a hundred years before that of Satan.</P>
<P>Thus far the ancient and the Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts differ very little from each other. But the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">atter have contrived to carry the matter much farther. They have contrived to connect the fabulous part of the &s;tory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with the fable originating from Mount Etna: and in order to make all the parts of the &s;tory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ye to|gether, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> taken to their aid the tradition of the Jews; for the Chri&s;tian mythology is made up partly from the ancient mythology, and partly from the Jewi&s;h traditions.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again, to bring on the &s;equel of the fable. He is then introduced into the garden of Eden in the &s;hape of a &s;nake, or a &s;erpent, and in that &s;hape he enters into familiar conver|&s;ation with Eve, who is no ways &s;urpri&s;ed to hear a
<PB N="11" REF="027458_0010_0FD3D95F89CA8FB0">
&s;nake talk; and the i&s;&s;ue of this t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">te-&agrave;-t&egrave;te is, that he per&s;uades her to eat an apple, and the eating of that ap|ple damns all mankind.</P>
<P>After giving Satan this triumph over the whole creation, one would have &s;uppo&s;ed that the church my|thologi&s;ts would have been kind enough to &s;end him back again to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pit; or, if they had not done this, that they would have put a mountain upon him (for they &s;ay that their faith can remove a mountain) or have put him <HI>under</HI> a mountain, as the former mythol|ogi&s;ts had done, to prevent his getting again among the women, and doing more mi&s;chief. But in&s;tead of this, they leave him at large, without even obliging him to give his parole. The &s;ecret of which is, that they could not do without him; and after being at the trouble of making him, they bribed him to &s;tay. They promi&s;ed him ALL the Jews, ALL the Turks by anticipation, nine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">enths of the world be&s;ide, and Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">omet into the bargain. After this, who can doubt the bountifulne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian mythology?</P>
<P>Having thus made an in&s;urrection and a battle in heaven, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ich none of the combatants could be either killed or wounded&mdash;put Satan into the pit&mdash;let him out again&mdash;given him a triumph over the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e creation&mdash;damned all manking for the eating of an apple, the Chri&s;|tian mythologi&s;ts bring the two ends of their fable togeth|er. They repre&s;ent this virtuous and amiable man, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be at once both God and man, and al&s;o the Son of God cele&s;tially begotten, on purpo&s;e to be &s;a|crificed, becau&s;e they &s;ay, that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple.</P>
<P>Putting a&s;ide every thing that might excite laugh|ter by its ab&s;urdity, or dete&s;tation by its prophanene&s;s, and confining our&s;elves merely to an examination of the parts, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a &s;tory more deroga|tory to the Almighty, more incon&s;i&s;tent with his wi&s;dom, more contradictor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to his power, than this &s;tory is.</P>
<P>In order to make for it a foundation to ri&s;e upon, the inventors were under the nece&s;&s;ity of giving to the being whom they call Satan, a power equally as great&punc;
<PB N="12" REF="027458_0011_0FD3D96108F53A68">
if not greater than they attribute to the Almighty. They have not only given him the power of liberating him&s;elf from the pit, after what they call his fall, but they have made that power increa&s;e afterwards to infinity. Before this fail, they repre&s;ent him only as an angel of limited exi&s;tence, as they repre&s;ent the re&s;t. After his fall, he becomes, by their account, omnipre&s;ent. He exi&s;ts ev|ery where, and at the &s;ame time. He occupies the whole immen&s;ity of &s;pace.</P>
<P>Not content with this deification of Satan, they repre&s;ent him as defeating by &s;tratagem, in the &s;hape of an animal of the creation, all the power and wi&s;dom of the Almighty. They repre&s;ent him as having compelled the Almighty to the <HI>direct nece&s;&s;ity</HI> either of &s;urrendering the whole of the creation to the government and &s;overeign|ty of this Satan, or of capitulating for its redemption, by coming down upon earth and exhibiting him&s;elf upon a cro&s;s in the &s;hape of a man.</P>
<P>Had the inventors of this &s;tory told it the contrary way, that is, had they repre&s;ented the Almighty as com|pelling Satan to exhibit <HI>him&s;elf</HI> on a cro&s;s in the &s;hape of a &s;nake, as a puni&s;hment for his new tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the &s;tory would have been le&s;s ab&s;urd, le&s;s contradictory. But in&s;tead of this, they make the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or triumph and the Almighty fall.</P>
<P>That many good men have believed this &s;trange fable, and lived very good lives under that belief (for credulity is not a crime) is what I have no doubt of. In the fir&s;t place, they were educated to believe it, and they would have believed any thing el&s;e in the &s;ame man|ner. There are al&s;o many who have been &s;o enthu&s;i|a&s;tically enraptured by what they have conceived to be the infinite love of God to man, in making a &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, that the vehemence of the idea has forbidden and deterred them from examining into the ab&s;urdity and prophanene&s;s of the &s;tory. The more unnatural any thing is, the more is it capable of becoming the object of di&s;mal admiration.</P>

eyes? Do we not &s;ee a fair creation prepared to receive us the in&s;tant we are born, a world furni&s;hed to our hands that co&s;t us nothing? Is it we that light up the &s;un; that pour down the rain; and fill the earth with abundance? Whether we &s;leep or wake, the va&s;t machinery of the univer&s;e &s;till goes on. Are the&s;e things, and the ble&s;&s;ings they indicate in future, nothing to us? Can our gro&s;s feelings be excited by no other &s;ubjects than tragedy and &s;uicide? Or is the gloomy pride of man become &s;o intolerable, that nothing can flatter it but a &s;acrifice of the Creator?</P>
<P>I know that this bold inve&s;tigation will alarm many, but it would be paying too great a compliment to their credulity to forbear it upon that account. The times and the &s;ubject demand it to be done. The &s;u&s;picion that the theory of what is called the Chri&s;tian church is fabulous, is becoming very exten&s;ive in all countries: and it will be a con&s;olation to men &s;taggering under that &s;u&s;picion, and doubting what to believe and what to di&s;|believe, to &s;ee the &s;ubject freely inve&s;tigated. I therefore pa&s;s on to an examination of the books called the Old and the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>The&s;e books, beginning with Gene&s;is and ending with Revelations (which by the bye, is a book of riddles that requires a Revelation to explain it) are, we are told, the word of God. It is therefore proper for us to know who told us &s;o, that we may know what credit to give the report. The an&s;wer to this que&s;tion is, that nobody can tell, except that we tell one another &s;o. The ca&s;e, however, hi&s;torically appears to be as follows:</P>
<P>When the church mythologi&s;ts e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;y&s;|tem, they collected all the writings they could find, and managed them as they plea&s;ed. It is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us, whether &s;uch of the writings as now appear, under the name of the Old and the New Te&s;ta|ment, are in the &s;ame &s;tate in which tho&s;e collectors &s;ay they found them; or whether they added, altered, abridg|ed or dre&s;&s;ed them up.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="027458_0013_0FD3D96661354438">
Be this as it may, they decided by vote, which of the books, out of the collection they had made, &s;hould be the WORD OF GOD, and which &s;hould not. They re|jected &s;everal: they voted others to be doubtful, &s;uch as the books called the Apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">raphy; and tho&s;e books which had a majority of votes, were voted to be the word of God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Book of Luke was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by a maje&s;ity of one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ly.</NOTE> Had they voted otherwi&s;e, all the people, &s;ince calling them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, had believed otherwi&s;e; for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the oth|er. Who the people were that did all this, we know nothing of; they call them&s;elves by the general name of the church: and this is all we know of the matter.</P>
<P>As we have no other external evidence or authority for believing tho&s;e books to be the word of God than what I have mentioned, which is no evidence or author|ity at all, I come, in the next place, to examine the in|ternal evidence contained in the books them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN the former part of this e&s;&s;ay I have &s;poken of revelation. I now proceed further with that &s;ubject, for the purpo&s;e of applying it to the books in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Revelation is a communication of &s;omething, which the per&s;on to whom that thing is revealed, did not know before. For if I have done a thing or &s;een it done, it needs no revelation to tell me I have done it, or &s;een it, nor to enable me to tell it, or to write it.</P>
<P>Revelation, therefore, cannot be applied to any thing done upon earth of which man is him&s;elf the actor or the witne&s;s; and con&s;equently all the hi&s;torical and an|ecdotal part of the Bible, which is almo&s;t the whole of it, is not within the meaning and compa&s;s of the word re|velation, and therefore is not the word of God.</P>

<P>As to the account of the creation, with which the book of Gene&s;is opens, it has all the appearance of being a tradition which the I&s;raelites had among them before they came into Egypt; and after their departure from that country, they put it at the head of their hi&s;tory, without telling, as it is mo&s;t probable they did not know, how they came by it. The manner in which the ac|count opens, &s;hews it to be traditionary. It begins ab|ruptly. It is nobody &s;peaks. It is nobody that hears. It is addre&s;&s;ed to nobody. It has neither fir&s;t, &s;econd, nor third per&s;on. It has every criterion of being a tra|dition. It has no voucher. Mo&s;es does not take it upon him&s;elf by introducing it with the formality that he u&s;es on other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ions, &s;uch as that of &s;aying, "<HI>The Lord &s;pake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mo&s;es, &s;aying.</HI>"</P>

account, however, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> harmle&s;s; and this is more than can be &s;aid of many other parts of the Bible.</P>
<P>When we read the ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cene &s;tories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unre|lenting vindictivene&s;s, with which more than half the Bi|ble is filled, it would be more con&s;i&s;tent that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God. It is a hi&s;tory of wickedne&s;s, that has &s;erved to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my own part, I &s;incerely dete&s;t it, as I dete&s;t every thing that is cruel.</P>
<P>We &s;carcely meet with any thing, a few phra&s;es ex|cepted, but what de&s;erves either our abhorrence, or our contempt, till we come to the mi&s;cellaneous parts of the Bible. In the anonymous publications in the P&s;alms and the Book of Job, more particularly, the latter, we find a great deal of elevated &s;entiment reverentially expre&s;&s;ed of the power and benignity of the Almighty; but they &s;tand on no higher rank than many other compo&s;itions on &s;imilar &s;ubjects as well before that time as &s;ince.</P>
<P>The Proverbs, which are &s;aid to be Solomon's, though mo&s;t probably a collection (becau&s;e they di&s;cover a knowledge of life, which his &s;ituation excluded him from knowing) are an in&s;tructive table of ethics. They are inferior in keenne&s;s to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wi&s;e and oeconomical than tho&s;e of the American Franklin.</P>
<P>All the remaining parts of the Bible, generally known by the name of the prophets, are the works of the Jewi&s;h poets and itinerant preachers, who mixed poetry, anecdote and devotion together: and tho&s;e works &s;till re|tain the air and &s;tile of poetry, though in tran&s;lation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As there are many readers who do not &s;ee that a compo|&s;ition is poetry unle&s;s it be in rhyme, it is for their information that I add this note.</P>
<P>Poetry con&s;i&s;ts principally in two things: Imagery and com|po&s;ition. The compo&s;ition of poetry differs from that of pro&s;e in the manner of mixing long and &s;hort &s;yllables together. Take a long &s;yllable out of a line of poetry, and put a &s;hort one in the room of it, or put a long &s;yllable where a &s;hort one &s;hould be, and that line will loo&s;e its poetical harmony. It will have an effect upon the line like that of mi&s;placing a note in a &s;ong.</P>
<P>The imagery in tho&s;e books called the Prophets, appertains altogether to poetry. It is fictio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and often extravagant, and not admi&s;&s;ible in any other kind of writing than poetry.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that the&s;e writings are compo&s;ed in poetical num|bers, I will take ten &s;yllables as they &s;tand in the book, and make a line of the &s;ame number of &s;yllables (heroic mea&s;ure) that &s;hall rhyme with the la&s;t word. It will then be &s;een, that the compo&s;ition of tho&s;e books is poetical mea&s;ure. The in&s;tance I &s;hall fir&s;t produce is from I&s;aiah.</P>

There is not throughout the whole book called the Bible, any word that de&s;cribes to us what we call a poet, nor any word that de&s;cribes what we call poetry. The ca&s;e is, that the word <HI>prophet</HI> to which latter times have affixed a new idea, was the Bible word for poet, and the word <HI>prophe&s;ying</HI> meant the art of making poetry. It al&s;o meant the art of playing poetry to a tune upon any in&s;trument of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>We read prophe&s;ying with pipes, taborets and horns; of prophe&s;ying with harps, with p&s;alteries, with cymbals, and with every other in&s;trument of mu&s;ic then in fa&s;hion. Were we now to &s;peak of prophe&s;ying with a fiddle, or with a pipe and tabor, the expre&s;&s;ion would have no meaning, or would appear ridiculous, and to &s;ome people contemptuous, becau&s;e we have changed the meaning of the word.</P>
<P>We are told of Saul being among the <HI>prophets,</HI> and al&s;o that he prophe&s;ied; but we are not told what they <HI>prophe&s;ied,</HI> nor what he <HI>prophe&s;ied.</HI> The ca&s;e is, there was nothing to tell; for the&s;e prophets were a company of mu&s;icians and poets; and Saul joined in the concert; and this was called <HI>prophe&s;ying.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="027458_0017_0FD3D97105F8F228">
The account given of this affair in the book called Samuel, is, that Saul met a <HI>company</HI> of prophets; a whole company of them! coming down with a p&s;altery, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aboret, a pipe and a harp, and that they prophe&s;ied, and that he prophe&s;ied with them. But it appears after|wards that Saul prophe&s;ied badly; that is, he performed his part badly; for it is &s;aid, that "an evil &s;pirit from God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As tho&s;e men, who call them&s;elves divines and commen|tators, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e very fond of puzzling one another, I leave them to con|te&s;t the meaning of the fir&s;t part of the phra&s;e, that of <HI>an evil &s;pirit from God.</HI> I keep to my text.

<P>Now were there no other pa&s;&s;age in the book called the Bible than this, to demon&s;trate to us that we have lo&s;t the original meaning of the word prophecy, and &s;ub&s;titut|ed another meaning in its place, this alone would be &s;uf|ficient; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to u&s;e and apply the word prophe&s;y in the place it is here u&s;ed and applied, if we give to it the &s;en&s;e which latter times have affixed to it. The manner in which it is here u&s;ed &s;trips it of all reli|gious meaning, and &s;hews that a man might then be a prophet, or might prophe&s;y, as he may now be a poet or a mu&s;ician, without any regard to the morality or the im|morality of his character. The word was originally a term of &s;cience, promi&s;cuou&s;ly applied to poetry and to mu&s;ic, and not re&s;tricted to any &s;ubject upon which poe|try and mu&s;ic might be exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>Deborah and Barak are called prophets, not becau&s;e they predicted any thing, but becau&s;e they compo&s;ed the poem or &s;ong that bears their name in celebration of an act already done. David is ranked among the prophets, for he was a mu&s;ician; and was al&s;o reputed to be (though perhaps very erroneou&s;ly) the author of the P&s;alms. But Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, are not called prophets. It does not appear from any accounts we have that they could either &s;ing, play mu&s;ic, or make po|etry.</P>

We are told of the greater and le&s;&s;er prophets. They might as well tell us of the greater and le&s;&s;er God; for there cannot be degrees in prophe&s;ying con&s;i&s;tently with its modern &s;en&s;e. But there are degrees in poetry, and there|fore the phra&s;e is reconcileable to the ca&s;e, when we un|der&s;tand by it the greater and the le&s;&s;er poets.</P>
<P>It is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary, after this, to offer any ob&s;ervations upon what tho&s;e men, &s;tiled prophets, have written. The axe goes at once to the root, by &s;hewing that the original meaning of the word has been mi&s;taken, and con&s;equently all the inferences that have been drawn from tho&s;e books, the devotional re&s;pect that has been paid to them, and the laboured commentaries that have been written upon them under that mi&s;taken meaning, are not worth di&s;puting about. In many things, however, the writings of the Jewi&s;h poets de&s;erve a better fate than that of being bound up, as they now are, with the tra&s;h that accompanies them, under the abu&s;ed name of the word of God.</P>
<P>If we permit our&s;elves to conceive right ideas of things, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily affix the right idea, not only of unchangeablene&s;s, but of the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of any change taking place, by any means or accident whatever, in that which we would honour with the name of the word of God; and therefore the word of God cannot exi&s;t in any written or human language.</P>
<P>The continually progre&s;&s;ive change to which the meaning of words is &s;ubject, the want of an univer&s;al language which renders tran&s;lations nece&s;&s;ary, the errors to which tran&s;lations are again &s;ubject, the mi&s;takes of copyi&s;ts and printers, together with the po&s;&s;ibility of wil|ful alteration, are of them&s;elves evidences, that human language, whether in &s;peech or in print, cannot be the vehi|cle of the word of God.

<P>THUS much for the Bible. I now go on to the book called the New Te&s;tament. The <HI>new</HI> Te&s;tament! that is, the <HI>new</HI> Will, as if there could be two wills of the Creator.</P>
<P>Had it been the object or the intention of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to e&s;tabli&s;h a new religion, he would undoubtedly have written the &s;y&s;tem him&s;elf, or <HI>procured it to be written</HI> in his life time. But there is no publication ex|tant, authenticated with his name.</P>
<P>All the books called the New Te&s;tament were writ|ten after his death. He was a Jew by birth and by pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and he was the Son of God in like manner that every other per&s;on is; for the Creator is the Father of all.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t four books, called Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, do not give a hi&s;tory of the life of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but only detached anecdotes of him. It appears from the&s;e books, that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months; and it was only during this &s;hort time, that tho&s;e men became acquainted with him. They make mention of him, at the age of twelve years, &s;itting, they &s;ay, among the Jewi&s;h doctors, a&s;king and an&s;wering them que&s;tions. As this was &s;eve|ral years before their acquaintance with him began, it is mo&s;t probable they had this anecdote from his parents. From this time there is no account of him for about &s;ix|teen years. Where he lived or how he employed him|&s;elf during this interval, is not known. Mo&s;t probably he was working at his father's trade, which was that of a carpenter. It does not appear that he had any &s;chool
<PB N="21" REF="027458_0020_0FD3D9754B5513C8">
education, and the probability is that he could not write, for his parents were extremely poor, as appears from their not being able to pay for a bed when he was born.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat curious that the three per&s;ons, who&s;e names are the mo&s;t univer&s;ally recorded, were of very ob&s;cure parentage. Mo&s;es was a foundling. Je&s;us Chri&s;t was born in a &s;table, and Mahomet was a mule driver. The fir&s;t and the la&s;t of the&s;e men, were found|ers of different &s;y&s;tems of religion; but Je&s;us Chri&s;t founded no new &s;y&s;tem. He called men to the practice of moral virtues, and the belief of one God. The great trait in his character is philanthropy.</P>
<P>The manner in which he was apprehended, &s;hews that he was not much known at that time; and it &s;hews al&s;o that the meetings he then held with his followers were in &s;ecret: and that he had given over or &s;u&s;pended, preaching publicly. Judas could no otherwi&s;e betray. him than by giving information where he was, and point|ing him out to the officers that went to arre&s;t him; and the rea&s;on for employing and paying Judas to do this, could ari&s;e only from the cau&s;es already mentioned, that of his not being much known, and living concealed.</P>
<P>The idea of his concealment not only agrees very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with his reputed divinity, but a&s;&s;ociates with it &s;ome|thing of pu&s;illanimity: and his being betrayed, or in other words, his being apprehended, on the information of one of his followers, &s;hews that he did not intend to be apprehended, and con&s;equently that he did not intend to be crucified.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian mythologi&s;ts tell us that Chri&s;t died for the &s;ins of the world, and that he came on <HI>purpo&s;e to die.</HI> Would it not then have been the &s;ame if he had died of a fever or of the &s;mall pox, of old age, or of any thing el&s;e?</P>
<P>The declaratory &s;entence which, they &s;ay, was pa&s;&s;ed upon Adam in ca&s;e he ate of the apple, was not, that <HI>thou &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alt be crucified,</HI> but <HI>thou &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alt &s;urely die.</HI> The &s;entence was death, and not the <HI>manner of dying.</HI> Cru|cifixion, therefore, or any other particular manner of dying,

<P>This &s;entence of death, which they tell us, was thus pa&s;&s;ed upon Adam; mu&s;t either have meant dying natu|rally; that is, cea&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o live; or have meant what the&s;e mythologi&s;ts call damnation; and con&s;equently, the act of dying on the part of Je&s;us Chri&s;t mu&s;t according to their &s;y&s;tem, apply as a prevention to one or other of tho&s;e two <HI>things</HI> happening to Adam and to us.</P>

that I ha&s;ten to the conclu&s;ion of it, in order to proceed to &s;omething better.</P>
<P>How much, or what parts of the books called the New Te&s;tament, were written by the per&s;ons who&s;e names they bear, is what we can know nothing of, neith|er are we certain in what language they were originally written. The matters they now contain may be cla&s;&s;ed under two heads; anecdote and epi&s;tolary corre&s;pon|dence.</P>
<P>The four books already mentioned, Matthew, Mark. Luke, and John, are altogether anecdotal. They relate events after they have taken place. They tell what Je&s;us Chri&s;t did and &s;aid, and what others did and &s;aid to him; and in &s;everal in&s;tances they relate the &s;ame event differently. Revelation is nece&s;&s;airly out of the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to tho&s;e books: not only becau&s;e of the di&s;agreement of the writers, but becau&s;e revelation cannot be applied to the relating of facts by the per&s;ons who &s;aw them done, nor to the relating or recording of any di&s;cour&s;e or con|ver&s;ation by tho&s;e who heard it. The book called the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, an anonymous work, belongs al&s;o to the anecdotal part.</P>
<P>All the other parts of the New Te&s;tament, except the book of enigmas, called the Revelations, are a collec|tion of letters under the name of Epi&s;tles; and the forge|ry of letters has been &s;uch a common practice in the world that the probability is, at lea&s;t, equal whether they are genuine or forged. One thing, however, is much le&s;s equivocal, which is, that out of the matters contained in tho&s;e books, together with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome old &s;to|ries, the church has &s;et up a &s;y&s;tem of religion very con|tradictory to the character of the per&s;on who&s;e name it bears. It has &s;et up a religion of pomp and of revenue in the pretended imitation of a per&s;on who&s;e life was hu|mility and poverty.</P>
<P>The invention of a purgatory, and of the relea&s;ing of &s;ouls therefrom, by prayers, bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ht of the church with money; the &s;elling of pardons, di&s;pen&s;ations, and indulgenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es, are revenue laws, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aring that name or
<PB N="24" REF="027458_0023_0FD3D97F0ACFA788">
carrying that appearance. But the ca&s;e neverthele&s;s is, that tho&s;e things derive their origin from the proxy&s;m of the crucifixion, and the theory deduced therefrom, which was, that one per&s;on could &s;tand in the place of a|nother, and could perform meritorious &s;ervices for him. The probability therefore is, that the whole theory or doctrine of what is called the redemption (which is &s;aid to have been accompli&s;hed by the act of one per&s;on in the room of another) was originally fabricated on purpo&s;e to bring forward and build all tho&s;e &s;econdary and pecu|niary redemptions upon; and that the pa&s;&s;ages in the books upon which the idea or theory of redemption is built, have been manufactured and fabricated for that purpo&s;e. Why are we to give this church credit, when &s;he tells us that tho&s;e books are genuine in every part, any more than we give her credit for every thing el&s;e &s;he has told us, or for the miracles &s;he &s;ays &s;he has performed. That &s;he <HI>could</HI> fabricate writings is certain, becau&s;e &s;he could write; and the compo&s;ition of the writings in que&s;|tion, is of that kind that any body might do it; and that &s;he <HI>did</HI> fabricate them is not more incon&s;i&s;tent with pro|bability, than that &s;he &s;hould tell us, as &s;he has done, that &s;he could and did work miracles.</P>
<P>Since then no external evidence can, at this long di&s;tance of time, be produced to prove, whether the church fabricated the doctrine called redemption or not, (for &s;uch evidence, whether for or again&s;t, would be &s;ubject to the &s;ame &s;u&s;picion of being fabricated) the ca&s;e can only be referred to the internal evidence which the thing carries of it&s;elf; and this affords a very &s;trong pre&s;umption of its being a fabrication. For the internal evidence is, that the theory or doctrine of redemption has for its ba&s;is, an idea of pecuniary ju&s;tice, and not that of moral ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>If I owe a per&s;on money and cannot pay him, and he threatens to put me in pri&s;on another per&s;on can take the debt upon him&s;elf, and pay it for me. But if I have committed a crime, every circum&s;tance of the ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> changed. Moral ju&s;tice cannot take the innocent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the guilty, even if the innocent would offer it&s;elf.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">po&s;e ju&s;tice to do this, is to de&s;troy the principle of its exi&s;tence, which is the thing it&s;elf. It is then no longer ju&s;tice. It is indi&s;criminate revenge.</P>
<P>This &s;ingle reflection will &s;hew that the doctrine of redemption is founded on a mere pecuniary idea, cor|re&s;ponding to that of a debt which another per&s;on might pay; and as this pecuniary idea corre&s;ponds again with the &s;y&s;tem of &s;econd redemptions, obtained through the means of money given to the church, for pardons, the probability is, that the &s;ame per&s;ons fabricated both the one and the other of tho&s;e theories; and that, in truth there is no &s;uch thing as redemption; that it is fabulous; and that man &s;tands in the &s;ame relative condition with his Maker he ever did &s;tand &s;ince man exi&s;ted; and that it is his greate&s;t con&s;olation to think &s;o.</P>
<P>Let him believe this, and he will live more con&s;i&s;tently and morally than by any other &s;y&s;tem. It is by his being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ught to contemplate him&s;elf as an out-law, as an out-ca&s;t, as a beggar, as a mumper, as one thrown, as it were, on a dunghill, at an immen&s;e di&s;tance from his Creator, and who mu&s;t make his approaches by creeping and cringing to intermediate beings, that he conceives either a contemptu|ous di&s;regard for every thing under the name religion, or becomes indifferent, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">urns what he calls devout. In the latter ca&s;e, he con&s;umes his life in grief, or the af|fectation of it. His prayers are reproaches. His humility is ingratitude. He calls him&s;elf a worm, and the fertile earth a dunghill; and all the ble&s;&s;ings of life by the thankle&s;s name of vanities. He de&s;pi&s;es the choice&s;t gift of God to man, the GIFT OF REASON; and hav|ing endeavoured to force upon him&s;elf the belief of a &s;y&s;|tem again&s;t which rea&s;on revolts, he ungratefully calls it <HI>human rea&s;on,</HI> as if man could give rea&s;on to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Yet with all this &s;trange appearance of humility, and this contempt for human rea&s;on, he ventures into the bold|e&s;t pre&s;umptions. He finds fault with every thing. His &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is never &s;atisfied; his ingratitude is never at an end. He takes on him&s;elf to direct the Almighty what to do, even in the government of the univer&s;e. He pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">atorially.

and when it is rain he prays for &s;un-&s;hine. He follows the &s;ame idea in every thing that he prays for; for what is the amount of all his prayers, but an attempt to make the Almighty change his mind, and act otherwi&s;e than he does. It is as if he were to &s;ay&mdash;thou knowe&s;t not &s;o well as I.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ome perhaps will &s;ay, are we to have no word of God&mdash;No revelation; I an&s;wer yes. There is a word of God; there is a revelation.</P>
<P>THE WORD OF GOD IS THE CREATION WE BEHOLD: And it is in <HI>this word,</HI> which no human in|vention can counterfeit or alter, that God &s;peaketh univer|&s;ally to man.</P>
<P>Human language is local and changeable, and is there|fore incapable of being u&s;ed as the means of unchangea|ble and univer&s;al information. The idea that God &s;ent Je&s;us Chri&s;t to publi&s;h, as they &s;ay, the glad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idings to all nations, from one end of the earth unto the other, is con&s;i&s;t|ent only with the ignorance of tho&s;e who knew nothing of the extent of the world, and who believed, as tho&s;e world-faviours believed, and continued to believe for &s;everal centuries, (and that in contradiction to the di&s;coveries of philo&s;ophers, and the experience of navigators) that the earth was flat like a trencher; and that a man might walk to the end of it.</P>
<P>But how was Je&s;us Chri&s;t to make any thing known to all nations? He could &s;peak but one language, which was Hebrew; and there are in the world &s;everal hundred languages. Scarcely any two nations &s;peak the &s;ame language, or under&s;tand each other; and as to tran&s;lations, every m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n who knows any thing of languages, knows that it is impo&s;&s;ible to tran&s;late from one language into another, not only without lo&s;ing a great part of the original, but frequently of mi&s;taking the &s;en&s;e: and be&s;ides all this, the art of printing was wholly unknown at the time Chri&s;t lived.</P>
<P>It is always nece&s;&s;ary that the means that are to ac|compli&s;h any end, be equal to the accompli&s;hment of that end, or the end cannot be accompli&s;hed. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in

this that the difference between finite and infinite power and wi&s;dom di&s;covers it&s;elf. Man frequently fails in ac|compli&s;hing his end, from a natural inability of power to the purpo&s;e, and frequently from the want of wi&s;dom to apply power properly. But it is impo&s;&s;ible for in|finite power and wi&s;dom to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l as man faileth. The means it u&s;eth are always equal to the end: but human language, more e&s;pecially as there is not an univer&s;al language, is incapable of being u&s;ed as an univer&s;al means of unchangeable and uniform informa|tion; and therefore it is not the means that God u&s;eth in manife&s;ting him&s;elf univer&s;ally to man.</P>
<P>It is only in the CREATION that all our ideas and conceptions of a <HI>world of God</HI> can unite. The creation &s;peaketh an univer&s;al language, independently of human &s;peech or human language, multiplied and various as they be. It is an ever-exi&s;ting original, which every man can read. It cannot be forged; it cannot be counterfeited; it cannot be lo&s;t; it cannot be altered; it cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. It does not depend upon the will of man whether it &s;hall be publi&s;hed or not; it publi&s;hes it&s;elf from one end of the earth to the other. It preaches to all nations and to all worlds; and this <HI>word of God</HI> reveals to man all that is nece&s;&s;ary for man to know of God.</P>
<P>Do we want to contemplate his power? We &s;ee it in the immen&s;ity of the creation. Do we want to con|template his wi&s;dom? We &s;ee it in the unchangeable or|der by which the incomprehen&s;ible Whole is governed. Do we want to contemplate his manificence? We &s;ee it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We &s;ee it in his not withholding that-abundance even from the unthankful. In &s;ine, do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the &s;cripture, which any human hand might make, but the &s;cripture called the creation.</P>
<P>The only idea that man can affix to the name of God, is that of a <HI>fir&s;t cau&s;e,</HI> the cau&s;e of all things. And incomprehen&s;ibly difficult as it is for man to conceive what a fir&s;t cau&s;e is, he arrives at the belief of it, from the ten-fold greater difficulty of di&s;believing it. It is difficult beyond de&s;cription to conceive that &s;pace can have no
<PB N="28" REF="027458_0027_0FD3D9850C738000">
end; but it is more difficult to conceive an end. It is difficult, beyond the power of man to conceive an eternal duration of what we call time; but it is more impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a time when there &s;hall be no time. In like manner of rea&s;oning, every thing we behold carries in it|&s;elf the internal evidence that it did not make it&s;elf. Every man is an evidence to him&s;elf that he did not make him&s;elf; neither could his father make him&s;elf, nor his grandfather, nor any of his race; neither could any tree, plant or animal, make it&s;elf: and it is the conviction ari&s;|ing from this evidence, that carries us on, as it were, by nece&s;&s;ity, to the belief of a fir&s;t cau&s;e, eternally exi&s;ting, of a nature totally different to any material exi&s;tence we know of, and by the power of which all things exi&s;t, and this fir&s;t cau&s;e man calls God.</P>
<P>It is only by the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, that man can di&s;|cover God. Take away that rea&s;on, and he would be in|capable of under&s;tanding any thing; and, in this ca&s;e, it would be ju&s;t as con&s;i&s;tent to read even the book called the bible, to a hor&s;e as to a man. How then is it that tho&s;e people pretend to reject rea&s;on?</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the only parts in the book called the bible, that convey to us any idea of God, are &s;ome chapters in Job, and the 19th p&s;alm. I recollect no other. Tho&s;e parts are true <HI>dei&s;tical</HI> compo&s;itions; for they treat of the <HI>deity</HI> through his works.

<P>The allu&s;ions in Job have all of them the &s;ame ten|dency with this p&s;alm; that of deducing or proving a truth, that would be otherwi&s;e unknown, from truths al|ready known.</P>
<P>I recollect not enough of the pa&s;&s;ages in Job to in|&s;ert them correctly: but there is one that occurs to me that is applicable to the &s;ubject I am &s;peaking upon.&mdash;"Can&s;t thou by <HI>&s;earching</HI> find out God? Can&s;t thou find out the Almighty to perfection.</P>
<P>I know not how the printers have pointed this pa&s;&s;age, for I keep no Bible: but it contains two di&s;tinct que&s;tions that admit of di&s;tinct an&s;wers.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Can&s;t thou by <HI>&s;earching</HI> find out God? Yes. Becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, I know I did not make my&s;elf, and yet I have exi&s;tence; and by <HI>&s;earching</HI> into the na|ture of other things, I find that no other thing could make it|&s;elf; and yet millions of other things exi&s;t; therefore, it is that I know by po&s;itive conclu&s;ion, re&s;ulting from this &s;earch, that there is a power &s;uperior to all tho&s;e things, and that power is God.</P>
<P>Secondly, Can&s;t thou find out the Almighty to <HI>per|fection?</HI> No. Not only becau&s;e the power and wi&s;dom he has manife&s;ted in the &s;tructure of the creation that I
<PB N="30" REF="027458_0029_0FD3D9880646D3A8">
behold, is to me incomprehen&s;ible; but becau&s;e even this manife&s;tation, great as it is, is probably but a &s;mall di&s;play of that immen&s;ity of power and wi&s;dom, by which millions of other worlds, to me invi&s;ible by their di&s;tance, were created and continue to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>It is evident that both the&s;e que&s;tions were put to the rea&s;on of the per&s;on to whom they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been addre&s;&s;ed; and it is only by admitting the fir&s;t que&s;|tion to be an&s;wered affirmatively, that the &s;econd could follow. It would have been unnece&s;&s;ary and, even ab|&s;urd, to have put a &s;econd que&s;tion more difficult than the fir&s;t, if the fir&s;t que&s;tion had been an&s;wered negatively. The two que&s;tions have different objects, the fir&s;t refers to the exi&s;tence of God, the &s;econd to his attributes. Rea&s;on can di&s;cover the one, but it falls infinitely &s;hort in di&s;covering the whole of the other.</P>
<P>I recollect not a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age in all the writings a&s;cribed to the men called apo&s;tles, that conveys any idea of what God is. Tho&s;e writings are chiefly controver&s;ial; and the gloomine&s;s of the &s;ubject they dwell upon, that of a man dying in agony on a cro&s;s, is better &s;uited to the gloomy genius of a monk in a cell, by whom it is not im|po&s;&s;ible they were written, than to any man breathing the open air of the creation. The only pa&s;&s;age that occurs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me, that has any reference to the works of God, by which only his power and wi&s;dom can be known, is re|lated to have been &s;poken by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a remedy again&s;t di&s;tru&s;tful care. "Behold the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lies of the field, they toil not, neither do they &s;pin." This, however, is far inferior to the a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ions in Job, and in the 19th p&s;alm; but it is &s;imilar in idea, and the mode&s;ty of the imagery is corre&s;pondent to the mode&s;ty of the man.</P>
<P>As to the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith, it appears to me as a &s;pecies of athei&s;m; a fort of religions denial of God. It profe&s;&s;es to believe in a man rather than in God.

The effect of this ob&s;curity has been that of turning every thing up&s;ide down, and repre&s;enting it in rever&s;e; and among the revolutions it has thus magically produced, it has made a revolution in theology.</P>
<P>That which is now called natural philo&s;ophy, em|bracing the whole circle of &s;cience, of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">onomy occupies the chief place, is the &s;tudy of the works of God and of the power and wi&s;dom of God in his works, and is the true theology.</P>

Man cannot invent any thing that is eternal and immutable; and the &s;cientific principles he employs for this purpo&s;e, mu&s;t, and are, of nece&s;&s;ity, as eternal and immutable as the laws by which the heavenly bodies move, or they could not be u&s;ed as they are, to a&s;certain the time when, and the manner how an eclip&s;e will take place.</P>
<P>The &s;cientific principles that man employs to obtain the fore-knowledge of an eclip&s;e, or of any thing el&s;e relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies, are con|tained chiefly in that part of &s;cience called trigonometry, or the properties of a triangle, which, when applied to the &s;tudy of the heavenly bodies, is called a&s;tronomy; when ap|plied to direct the cour&s;e of a &s;hip on the ocean, it is called navigation; when applied to the con&s;truction of figures drawn by a rule and compa&s;s, it is called geometry, when ap|plied to the con&s;truction of plans of edifices, it is called archi|tecture; when applied to the mea&s;urement of any portion of the &s;urface of the earth, it is called land &s;urveying. In fine, it is the &s;oul of &s;cience. It is an eternal truth: it contains the <HI>mathematical demon&s;tration</HI> of which man &s;peaks, and the extent of its u&s;es are unknown.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that man can make or draw a triangle, and therefore a triangle is an human invention.</P>
<P>But the triangle, when drawn, is no other than the image of the principle; it is a delineation to the eye,
<PB N="33" REF="027458_0032_0FD3D98C8C3EE340">
and from thence to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a principle that would otherwi&s;e be imperceptible. The triangle does not make the principle, any more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n a candle taken into a room that was dark, makes the chairs and tables that before were invi&s;ible. All the properties of a triangle exi&s;t independ|ently of the figure, and exi&s;ted before any triangle was drawn or thought of by man. Man had no more to do in the formation of tho&s;e properties, or principles, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had to do in making the laws by which the heavenly bodies move; and therefore the one mu&s;t have the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">vine origin as the other.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be &s;aid that man can make a triangle, &s;o al&s;o it may be &s;aid, he can make the mechanical in&s;trument called the lever. But the princi|ple by which the lever acts as a thing di&s;tinct from the in|&s;trument, and would exi&s;t if the in&s;trument did not: it attaches it&s;elf to the in&s;trument after it is made; the in|&s;trument therefore can act no otherwi&s;e than it does act; neither can all the effort of human invention make it act otherwi&s;e. That which in all &s;uch ca&s;es, man calls the <HI>effect,</HI> is no other than the principle it&s;elf, rendered per|ceptible to the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Since then man cannot make principles, from whence did he gain a knowledge of them, &s;o as to be able to ap|ply them not only to things on earth, but to a&s;certain the motion of bodies &s;o immen&s;ely di&s;tant from him as all the heavenly bodies are? From whence, I a&s;k, <HI>could</HI> he gain that knowledge, but from the &s;tudy of the true theo|logy?</P>
<P>It is the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e that has taught this knowledge to man. That &s;tructure is an ever exi&s;ting ex|hibition of every principle upon which every part of methematical &s;cience is founded. The offspring of this &s;cience is mechanics; for mechanics is no other than the principles of &s;cience applied practically. The man who proportions the &s;everal parts of a mill, u&s;es the &s;ame &s;cien|tific principles as if he had the power of con&s;tructing an univer&s;e: but as he cannot give to matter that invi&s;ible agency, by which all the component parts of the im|men&s;e machine of the univer&s;e have influence upon each other, and act in motional uni&s;on together, without any
<PB N="34" REF="027458_0033_0FD3DAF2097B0080">
apparent contact, and to which man has given the name of attraction, gravitation, and repul&s;ion, he &s;upplies the place of that agency by the humble imitation of teeth ano|cogs. All the parts of man's microco&s;m mu&s;t vi&s;ibly touch. But could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e gain a knowledge of that agency, &s;o as to be able to apply it in practice, we might then &s;ay, that another <HI>canonical book</HI> of the word of God had been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>If man could after the properties of the lever, &s;o al&s;o could he alter the properties of the triangle: for a lever (taking that &s;ort of lever which is called a &s;teel-yard, for the &s;ake of explanation) forms, when in motion, a trian|gle. The line it de&s;cends from (one point of that line being in the fulcrum) the line it de&s;cends to, and the chord of the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, which the end of the lever de&s;cribes in the air, are the three &s;ides of a triangle. The other arm of the lever de&s;cribes al&s;o a triangle; and the corre&s;|ponding &s;ides of tho&s;e two triangles, calculated &s;cientifi|cally, or mea&s;ured geometrically; and al&s;o the fines, tangents, and &s;ecants generated from the angles, and geo|metrically mea&s;ured have the &s;ame proportions to each other, as the different weights have that will balance each other on the lever, leaving the weight of the lever out of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be &s;aid that man can make a wheel and axis, that he can put wheels of different magnitudes to|gether, and produce a mill. Still the ca&s;e comes back to the &s;ame point, which is, that he did not make the prin|ciple that gives the wheels tho&s;e powers. That principle is as unalterable as in the former ca&s;es, or rather it is the &s;ame principle under a different appearance to the eye.</P>
<P>The power that two wheels, of different magnitudes, have upon each other, is in the &s;ame proportion as if the &s;emidiameter of the two wheels were joined together, and made into that kind of lever I have de&s;cribed, &s;u&s;pended at the part where the &s;emidiameters join; for the two wheels &s;cientifically con&s;idered, are no other than the two circles generated by the motion of the compound lever.</P>
<P>It is from the &s;tudy of the true theology, that all
<PB N="35" REF="027458_0034_0FD3DAF3194540E8">
our knowledge of &s;cience is derived, and it is from that knowledge that all the arts have originated.</P>
<P>The Almighty Lecturer, by di&s;playing the princi|ples of &s;cience in the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e, has invited man to &s;tudy and to imitation. It is as if he had &s;aid to the inhabitants of this globe that we call ours, "I have made an earth for man to dwell upon, and I have rendered the &s;tarry heavens vi&s;ible, to teach him &s;cience and the arts. He can now provide for his own comfort, AND LEARN FROM MY MUNIFICENCE TO ALL, TO BE KIND TO EACH OTHER."</P>
<P>Of what u&s;e is it unle&s;s it be to teach man &s;ome|thing that his eye is endued with the power of beholding, to an incomprehen&s;ible di&s;tance, an immen&s;ity of worlds revolving in the ocean of &s;pace? Or of what u&s;e is it that this immen&s;ity of worlds is vi&s;ible to man? What has man to do with the Pleiades, with Orion, with Siri|us, with the &s;tar he calls the north &s;tar, with the moving orbs he has named Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury, if no u&s;es are to follow from their being vi&s;i|ble? A le&s;s power of vi&s;ion would have been &s;ufficient for man, if the immen&s;ity he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, were given only to wa&s;te it&s;elf, as it were, on an immen&s;e de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">art of &s;pace glittering with &s;hows.</P>
<P>It is only by contemplating what he calls the &s;tarry heavens, as the book and &s;chool of &s;cience, that he di&s;|covers any u&s;e in their being vi&s;ible to him, or any ad|vantage refulting from his immen&s;ity of vi&s;ion. But when he contemplates the &s;ubject in this light, he &s;ees an additional motive for &s;aying that <HI>nothing was made in vain;</HI> for in vain would be this power of vi&s;ion if it taught man nothing.</P>
<P>As the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith has made a revolu|tion in theology, &s;o al&s;o has it made a revolution in the &s;tate of learning. That which is now called learning, was not learning originally. Learning does not con&s;i&s;t, as the &s;chools now make it to con&s;i&s;t, in the knowledge of languages, but in the knowledge of things to which lan|guage gives names.</P>
<P>The Greeks were a learned people; but learning with them did not con&s;i&s;t in &s;peaking Greek any more
<PB N="36" REF="027458_0035_0FD3DAF592B6C198">
than in a Roman's &s;peaking Latin, or a Frenchman's &s;peaking French, or an Engli&s;hman's &s;peaking Engli&s;h. From what we know of the Greeks, it does not appear that they knew or &s;tudied any language but their own; and this was one cau&s;e of their being &s;o learned; it af|forded them more time to apply them&s;elves to better &s;tudies. The &s;chools of the Greeks were &s;chools of &s;ci|ence and philo&s;ophy, and not of languages; and it is in the knowledge of the things that &s;cience and philo&s;ophy teach, that learning con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Putting a&s;ide, as matter of di&s;tinct con&s;ideration, the outrage offered to the moral ju&s;tice of God, by &s;uppo&s;ing him to make the innocent &s;uffer for the guilty, and al&s;o the loo&s;e morality and low contrivance of &s;uppo&s;ing him to change him&s;elf into the &s;hape of a man, in order to make an excu&s;e to him&s;elf for not executing his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;entence upon Adam: putting, I &s;ay, tho&s;e things a|&s;ide, as matter of di&s;tinct con&s;ideration, it is certain, that what is called the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith, including in it the whim&s;ical account of the creation; the &s;trange &s;tory of Eve, the &s;nake and the apple; the amphibious idea of a man-god; the corporeal idea of the death of a god; the mythological idea of a family of gods; and the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three, are all irreconcileable, not only to the divine gift of rea&s;on that God has given to man, but to the knowledge that man gains of the power and wi&s;dom of God, by the aid of the &s;ciences, and by &s;tudying the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e that God has made.</P>
<P>The &s;etters up, therefore, and the advocates of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith, could not but fore&s;ee that the continually progre&s;&s;ive knowledge that man would gain by the aid of &s;cience, of the power and wi&s;dom of God, manife&s;ted in the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e, and in all the works of creation, would militate again&s;t, and call into que&s;tion, the truth of their &s;y&s;tem of faith; and there|fore it bacame nece&s;&s;ary to their purpo&s;e to cut learning down to a &s;ize le&s;s dangerous to their project, and this they effected by re&s;tricting the idea of learning to the dead &s;tudy of dead languages.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="027458_0036_0FD3DAF798308CF8">
They not only rejected the &s;tudy of &s;cience out of the chri&s;tian &s;chools, but they per&s;ecuted it; and it is only within about the la&s;t two centuries that the &s;tudy has been revived. So late as 1610, Galileo, a Florentine, di&s;cov|ered and introduced the u&s;e of tele&s;copes, and by applying them to ob&s;erve the motions and appearances of the heav|enly bodies, afforded additional means for a&s;certaining the true &s;tructure of the univer&s;e. In&s;tead of being e&s;teemed for the&s;e di&s;coveries, he was &s;entenced to renounce them or the opinions re&s;ulting from them, as a damnable here&s;y. And prior to that time Vigi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ius was condemned to be burned for a&s;&s;erting the antipodes; or, in other words, that the earth was a globe, and habitable in every part where there was land, yet the truth of this is now too well know even to be told.</P>
<P>If the belief of errors not morally bad did no mi&s;chief it would make no part of the moral duty of man to oppo&s;e and remove them. There was no moral ill in believing the earth flat like a trencher, any more than there was moral virtue in believing it was round like a globe; neither was there any moral ill in be|lieving that the Creator made no other world than this, any more than there was moral virtue in believing that he made millions, and that the infinity of &s;pace is filled with worlds. But when a &s;y&s;tem of religion is made to grow out of a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of creation that is not true, and to unite it&s;elf there with in a manner almo&s;t in|&s;eparable therefrom, the ca&s;e a&s;&s;umes an entirely different ground. It is then that errors not morally bad, become fraught with the &s;ame mi&s;chiefs as if they were. It is then that the truth, though otherwi&s;e indifferent in it&s;elf, becomes an e&s;&s;ential, by becoming the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">riterion, that either confirms by corresponding evidence, or denies by contradictory evidence, the reality of the religion it&s;elf. In this view of the ca&s;e, it is the moral duty of man to obtain every po&s;&s;ible evidence that the &s;tructure of the heavens, or any other part of creation affords, with re|&s;pect to &s;y&s;tems of religion. But this, the &s;upporters or partizans of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, as if dreading the re|&s;ult,
<PB N="38" REF="027458_0037_0FD3DAF915588210">
ince&s;&s;antly oppo&s;ed, and not only rejected the &s;ci|ences, but per&s;ecuted the profe&s;&s;ors. Had Newton or De&s;cartes lived three or four hundred years ago, and pur|&s;ued their &s;tudies as they did, it is mo&s;t probable they would not have lived to fini&s;h them; and, had Franklin drawn lightning from the clouds, at the &s;ame time, it would have been at the hazard of expiring for it in flames.</P>
<P>Later times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals: but however unwilling the partizans of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem may be to believe or to acknowledge it, it is neverthele&s;s true that the age of ignorance com|menced with the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. There was more knowledge in the world before that period, than for ma|ny centuries afterwards; and as to religions knowledge, the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, as already &s;aid, was only another &s;pecies of mythology; and the mythology to which it &s;ucceeded was a corruption of an ancient &s;y&s;tem of the|i&s;m.</P>
<P>It is owing to this long interregnum of &s;cience, and to no other cau&s;e, that we have now to look back through a va&s;t cha&s;m of many hundred years to the re&s;pectable characters we call the ancients. Had the progre&s;&s;ion of knowledge gone on proportionably with the &s;tock that before exi&s;ted that cha&s;m would have been filled up with characters ri&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in knowledge to each other; and tho&s;e ancients, we now &s;o much admire, would have appeared re&s;pectably in the back ground of the &s;cene. But the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem laid all wa&s;te; and if we take our &s;tand about the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, we look back through that long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to the times of the ancients, as over a va&s;t &s;andy de&s;ert, is which not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> appears to intercept the vi&s;ion to the fertile hills beyond.</P>
<P>It is an incon&s;i&s;tency, &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to be credit|ed, that any thing &s;hould exi&s;t under the name of a <HI>reli|gion,</HI> that held it to be <HI>irreligious</HI> to &s;tudy and contem|plate the &s;tructure, of the univer&s;e that God had made. But the fact is too well e&s;tabli&s;hed to be denied. The event that &s;erved more than any other to break the find link in this long chain of de&s;potic ignorance, is that known by the name of the reformation by Luther. From
<PB N="39" REF="027458_0038_0FD3DAFB918951A0">
that time, though it does not appear to have made any part of the intention of Luther, or of tho&s;e who are cal|led reformers, the Sciences began to revive, and Liberal|ity, their natural a&s;&s;ociate, began to appear. This was the only public good the reformation did; for with re&s;|pect to religious good, it might as well not have taken place. The mythology &s;till continued the &s;ame; and a multiplicity of national popes grew out of the downfal of the Pope of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hewn, from the internal evidence of things, the cau&s;e that produced a change in the &s;tate of learning, and the motive for &s;ub&s;tituting the &s;tudy of the deed languages in the place of the Sciences, I proceed, in addition to the &s;everal ob&s;ervations already made in the for|mer part of this work, to compare, or rather to confront, the evidence that the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e affords, with the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of religion. But as I cannot begin this part better than by referring to the ideas that occurred to me at an early part of life, and which I doubt not have occurred in &s;ome degree to almo&s;t every other per&s;on at one time or other, I &s;hall &s;tate what tho&s;e ideas were, and add there to &s;uch other matters as &s;hall ari&s;e out of the &s;ubject, giving to the whole, by way of preface, a &s;hort introduction.</P>
<P>My father, being of the quaker profe&s;&s;ion, it was my good fortune to have an exceedingly good moral edu|cation, and a tolearble &s;tock of u&s;eful learning. Though I went to the grammer &s;chool,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Grammar School at Thetford, in Norfolk.</NOTE> I did not learn Latin, not only becau&s;e I had no inclination to learn languages, but becau&s;e of the objection the quakers have again&s;t the books in which the language is taught. But this did not prevent me from being acquainted with the &s;ubjects of all the Latin books u&s;ed in the &s;chool.</P>
<P>The natural bent of my mind was to &s;cience. I had &s;ome turn, and I believe &s;ome talent, for poetry; but this
<PB N="40" REF="027458_0039_0FD3DAFB96AB3900">
I rather repre&s;&s;ed than encouraged, as leading too much into the field of imagination. As &s;oon as I was able I purcha&s;ed a pair of globes, and attended the philo&s;ophi|cal lectures of Martin and Fergu&s;on, and became after|wards acquainted with Dr. Bevis, of the &s;ociety called the Royal Society, then living in the Temple, and as excellent a&s;tronomer.</P>
<P>I had no di&s;po&s;ition for what was called politics. It pre&s;ented to my mind no other idea than is contained in the word Jockey&s;hip. When, therefore, I turned my thoughts toward, matters of government, I had to form a &s;y&s;tem for my&s;elf that accorded with the moral and philo&s;ophic principles in which I had been educated. I few, or at lea&s;t I thought I &s;aw, a va&s;t &s;cene opening it|&s;elf to the world in the affairs of America; and it appear|ed to me, that unle&s;s the Americans changed the plan they were then pur&s;uing, with re&s;pect to the government of England, and declared them&s;elves independent, they would not only involve them&s;elves in a multiplicity of new dif|ficulties, but &s;hut out the pro&s;pect that was then offering it&s;elf to mankind, through their means. It was from the&s;e motives that I publi&s;hed the work known by the name of COMMON SENSE, which is the fir&s;t work I ever did publi&s;h: and &s;o far as I can judge of my&s;elf, I believe I never &s;hould have been known in the world as an author on any &s;ubject whatever, had it not been for the affairs of America. I wrote COMMON SENSE the latter end of the year 1775, and publi&s;hed it the fir&s;t of January, 1776. Independence was declared the fourth of July following. Any per&s;on who was made ob&s;ervations on the &s;tate and progre&s;s of the human mind, by ob&s;erving his own, can|not but have ob&s;erved that there are two di&s;tinct cla&s;les of what we call Thoughts: tho&s;e that we produce in our|&s;elves by reflection and the act of thinking, and tho&s;e that bolt into the mind of their own accord. I have always made it a rule to treat tho&s;e voluntary vi&s;itors with civili|ty, taking care to examine, as well as I was able, if they were worth entertaining; and it is from them I have ac|quired almo&s;t all the knowledge that I have. As to the learning that any per&s;on gains from &s;chool education, it
<PB N="41" REF="027458_0040_0FD3DAFCD37F5540">
&s;erves only, like a &s;mall capital, to put him in the way of beginning learning for him&s;elf afterwards. Every per&s;on of learning is finally his own teacher; the rea&s;on of which is that principles being of a di&s;tinct quality to circum&s;tan|ces, cannot be impre&s;&s;ed upon the memory. Their place of mental re&s;idence is the under&s;tanding, and they are never &s;o la&s;ting as when they begin by conception. Thus much for the introductory part.</P>
<P>From the time I was capable of conceiving an idea, and acting upon it by reflection, I either doubted the truth of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, or thought it to be a &s;trange affair; I &s;carcely know which it was; but I we I remem|ber, when about &s;even or eight years of age, hearing a &s;ermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great de|vote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the church, upon the &s;ubject of what is called <HI>Rede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ption by the Death of the Son of God.</HI> After the &s;ermon was ended, I went into the garden and as I was going down the garden &s;tep (for I perfectly recollect the &s;pot) I revolted at the recollection of what I had heard, and thought to my&s;elf that it was making God Almighty act like a pa&s;&s;ionate man that killed his &s;on when he could not revenge him&s;elf any other way; and as I was &s;ure a man would be hanged that did &s;uch a thing, I could not &s;ee for what purpo&s;e they preach &s;uch &s;er|mous. This was not one of tho&s;e kind of thoughts that had any thing in it of childi&s;h levity; it was to me a &s;erious reflection, ari&s;ing from the idea I had, that God was too good to do &s;uch an action, and al&s;o too Almighty to be under any nece&s;&s;ity of doing it. I believe in the &s;ame manner to this moment; and I moreover believe, that any &s;y&s;tem of religion that has any thing in it that &s;hocks the mind of a child cannot be a true &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It &s;eems as if parents of the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, were a&s;hamed to tell their children any thing about the principles of their religion. They &s;ometimes in&s;truct them in morals, and talk to them of the goodne&s;s of what they call Providence: for the chri&s;tian mythology has five der|ties: there is God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Gho&s;t, the God Providence, and the Godde&s;s Na|ture.
<PB N="42" REF="027458_0041_0FD3DAFF74063108">
But the chri&s;tian &s;tory of God the Father putting his &s;on to death, or employing people to do it (for that is the plain language of the &s;tory) cannot be told by a parent to a child; and to tell him that it was done to make man|kind happier and better, is making the &s;tory &s;till wor&s;e, as if mankind could be improved by the example of murder; and to tell him that all this is a my&s;tery, is only making an excu&s;e for the incredibility of it.</P>
<P>How different is this to the pure and &s;imple profe&s;|&s;ion of Dei&s;m? The true Dei&s;t has but one Deity; and his religion con&s;i&s;ts in contemplating the power, wi&s;dom, and benignity of the Deity in his works, and in endea|vouring to imitate him in every thing moral, &s;cientifical, and mechanical.</P>
<P>The religion that approaches the neare&s;t of all others to true dei&s;m, in the moral and&punc; benign part thereof, is that profe&s;&s;ed by the quakers, but they have contracted them&s;elves too much by leaving the works of God out of their &s;y&s;tem. Though I reverence their philanthropy, I cannot help &s;miling at the conceit, that if the ta&s;te of a quaker could have been con&s;ulted at the creation, what a &s;ilent and drab-coloured creation it would have been! Not a flower would have blo&s;&s;omed its gaieties, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a bird been permitted to &s;ing.</P>
<P>QUITTING the&s;e reflections, I proceed to other matters. After I had made my&s;elf ma&s;ter of the u&s;e of the globes and of the orrery, and conceived an idea of the infinity of &s;pace, and of the eternal divi&s;ibility of matter, and obtained, at lea&s;t, a general knowledge of what is cal|led natural philo&s;ophy, I began to compare, or, as I have before &s;aid, to confront the internal evidence tho&s;e things afford with the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith.</P>
<P>Though it is not a direct article of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;|tem that this world that we inhabit is the whole of the hab|itable creation, yet it is &s;o worked up therewith, from what is called the Mo&s;aic account of the creation, the &s;to|ry of Eve and the apple, and the counterpart of that &s;tory,
<PB N="43" REF="027458_0042_0FD3DB00B5CDF0E8">
the death of the Son of God, that to believe otherwi&s;e; that is, to believe that God created a plurality of worlds at lea&s;t as numerous as what we call &s;tars, renders the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith at once little and ridiculous, and &s;oatters it in the mind like feathers in the air. The two beliefs cannot be held together in the &s;ame mind; and he who thinks that he believes both, has thought but little of either.</P>
<P>Though the belief of a plurality of worlds was fa|miliar to the ancients, it is only wihtin the la&s;t three cen|turies that the extent and dimen&s;ions of this globe that we inhabit have been a&s;certained. Several ve&s;&s;els, follow|ing the tract of the ocean, have failed entirely round the world, as a man may march in a circle, and come round by the contrary &s;ide of the circle to the &s;pot he &s;et out from; The circular dimen&s;ions of our world in the wid|e&s;t part, as a man would mea&s;ure the wide&s;t round of an apple or a ball, is only twenty-five thou&s;and and twenty Engli&s;h miles, reckoning &s;ixty-nine miles and an half to an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">torial degree, and may be failed round in the &s;pace of about three years.</P>
<P>A world of this extent may, at fir&s;t thought, appear to us to be great; but if we compare it with the immen|&s;ity of &s;pace in which it is &s;u&s;pended, like a bubble or a balloon in the air, it is infinitely le&s;s in proportion than the &s;malle&s;t grain of &s;and is to the &s;ize of the world, or the fine&s;t particle of de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the whole ocean, and is there|fore but &s;mall; and as will be hereafter &s;hewn, is only <HI>one</HI> of a &s;y&s;tem of worlds, of which the univer&s;al creation is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to gain &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aint idea of the immen|&s;ity of &s;pace in which this and all the other worlds are &s;u&s;|pended, if we follow a progre&s;&s;ion of ideas. When we think of the &s;ize or dimen&s;ions of a room, our ideas limit them&s;elves to the walls, and there they &s;top. But when our eye, or our imagination, darts into &s;pace; that is, when it looks upward into what we call the open air; we cannot conceive any walls or boundaries it can have; and if for the &s;ake of re&s;ting our ideas, we &s;uppo&s;e a bounda|ry, the que&s;tion immediately renews it&s;elf, and a&s;ks, what
<PB N="44" REF="027458_0043_0FD3DB03A54AD448">
is beyond that boundary? and in the &s;ame manner, what is beyond the next boundary? and &s;o on, till the fatiguing imagination returns and &s;ays, <HI>there is no end.</HI> Cortain|ly, then the Creator was not pent for room when he made this world no larger than it is; and we have to &s;eek the rea&s;on in &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>If we take a &s;urvey of our own world, or rather of this of which the Creator has given us the u&s;e, as our portion in the immen&s;e &s;y&s;tem of creation, we find every part of it, the earth, the waters, and the air that &s;urround it, field, and, as it were, crowded with life, down from the large&s;t animals that we know of, to the &s;malle&s;t infects the naked eye can behold, and from thence to others &s;till &s;maller, and totally invi&s;ible without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the micro&s;cope. Every tree, every plant, every leaf, &s;erves not only as an habitation, but as a world to &s;ome nume|rous race, till animal exi&s;tence become &s;o exceedingly refined, that the effluvia of a blade of gra&s;s would be food for thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>Since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the immen&s;ity of &s;pace is a naked void, lying in eternal wa&s;te? There is room for mil|lions of worlds as large or larger than ours, and each of them millions of miles apart from each other.</P>
<P>Having now arrived at this point, if we carry our ideas only one thought further, we &s;hall &s;ee, perhaps, the true rea&s;on at lea&s;t a very good rea&s;on for our happine&s;s, why the Creator, in&s;tead of making one immen&s;e world, extending over an immen&s;e quantity of &s;pace, has preferred dividing that quantity of matter into &s;everal di&s;tinct and &s;parate worlds, which we call planets, of which our earth is one. But before I explain my ideas upon this &s;ubject, it is nece&s;&s;ary (not for the &s;ake of tho&s;e that already know, but for tho&s;e who do not) to &s;hew what the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e is.</P>
<P>That part of the univer&s;e, that is called the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem (meaning the &s;y&s;tem of worlds to which our earth belongs, and of which Sol, or in Engli&s;h language, the Sun, is the center) con&s;i&s;ts, be&s;ides the Sun, of fix di&s;tinct orbs, or planets, or worlds, be&s;ides the
<PB N="45" REF="027458_0044_0FD3DB062F273A60">
&s;econdary bodies, called &s;atellites, or moons, of which our earth has one that attends her in her annual revolution round the Sun, in like manner as the other &s;atellites, or moons attend the planets, or worlds, to which they &s;eve|rally belong, as may be &s;een by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the tele|&s;cope.</P>
<P>The Sun is the center, round which tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix worlds or planets, revolve at different di&s;tances therefrom, and in circles concentric to each other. Each world keeps con&s;tantly in nearly the &s;ame tract round the Sun, and continues at the &s;ame time, turning round it&s;elf, in nearly an upright po&s;ition, as a top turns round it&s;elf when it is &s;pinning on the ground, and leans a little &s;ide ways.</P>
<P>It is this leaning of the earth (23&frac12; degrees) that occa&s;ions &s;ummer and winter, and the different length of days and nights. If the earth turned round it&s;elf in a po&s;ition perpendicular to the plane or level of the circle it moves in round the Sun, as a top turns round, when it &s;tands erect on the ground, the days and nights would be always of the &s;ame length, twelve hours day, and twelve hours night, and the &s;ea&s;on would be uniformly the &s;ame throughout the year.</P>
<P>Every time that a planet (our earth for example) turns round it&s;elf, it makes what we call day and night; and every time it goes entirely round the &s;un, it makes what we call a year, con&s;equently our world turns three hundred and &s;ixty-five times round it&s;elf, in going once round the &s;un.</P>
<P>The names that the ancients gave to tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix worlds, and which are &s;till called by the &s;ame names, are Mercu|ry, Venus, this world that we call ours, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. They appear larger to the eye than the &s;tars, being many million miles nearer to our earth than any of the &s;tars are. The planet Venus is that which is called the evening &s;tar, and &s;ometimes the morning &s;tar, as &s;he happens to &s;et after, or ri&s;e before, the &s;un, which, in either ca&s;e, is never more than three hour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>The &s;un, as before &s;aid, being the center, the plan|et, or world, neare&s;t the &s;un, is Mercury; his di&s;tance from the &s;un is thirty-four million miles, and he moves
<PB N="46" REF="027458_0045_0FD3DB07619240E8">
round in a circle always at that di&s;tance from the &s;un, as a top may be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;pin round in the tract in which a hor&s;e goes in a mill. The &s;econd world is Venus; &s;he is fifty-&s;even million miles di&s;tant from the &s;un, and con|&s;equently moves round in a circle much greater than that of Mercury. The third world is this that we inhabit, an I which is ninety-five million miles di&s;tant from the &s;un, and con&s;equently moves round in a circle greater than that of Venus. The fourth world is Mars; he is di&s;|tant from the &s;un one hundred and thirty-four million miles, and con&s;equently moves round in a circle greater than that of our earth. The fifth is Jupiter; he is di&s;tant from the &s;un five hundred and fifty-&s;even million miles, and con&s;equently moves round to a circle greater than that of Mars. The &s;ixth world i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Saturn; he is di&s;tant from the &s;un &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-three mil|lion miles, and con&s;equently moves round in a circle that &s;urrounds the circles or orbits of all the other worlds or planets.</P>
<P>The &s;pace, therefore, in the air, or in the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, that our &s;olar &s;y&s;tem takes up for the &s;everal worlds to perform their revolutions in round the &s;un, is of the extent, in a &s;trait line, of the whole diameter of the orbit or circle in which Saturn moves round the &s;un, which being double his di&s;tance from the &s;un, is fifteen hundred and twenty-&s;ix million miles; and its circular extent is nearly five thou&s;and million, and its globical con|tent is almo&s;t three thou&s;and five hundred millions times three thou&s;and five hundred million &s;quare miles.</P>
<P>But this, immen&s;e as it is, is only one &s;y&s;tem of worlds; Beyond this, at a va&s;t di&s;tance into &s;pace, far beyond all power of calculation, are the &s;tars, called the fixed &s;tars. They are called fixed, becau&s;e they have no revolutionary motion as the &s;ix worlds or planets have, that I have been de&s;cribing. Tho&s;e fixed &s;tars continue always at the &s;ame di&s;tance from each other, and always in the &s;ame place, as the &s;un does in the center of our &s;y&s;tem. The probability therefore i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, that each of tho&s;e fixed &s;tars is al&s;o a &s;un, round which another &s;y&s;tem of worlds or planets, though too remote for us to di&s;cover,
<PB N="47" REF="027458_0046_0FD3DB0A749A8998">
performs its revolutions, as our &s;y&s;tem of worlds does round our central &s;un.</P>
<P>By this ea&s;y progre&s;&s;ion of ideas, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he immen&s;ity of &s;pace will appear to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s to be filled with &s;y&s;tems of worlds; and that no part of &s;pace lies wa&s;te, any more than any part of our globe of earth and water is left unoccupied.</P>
<P>HAVING thus endeavoured to convey, in a fa|miliar and ea&s;y manner, &s;ome idea of the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e, I return to explain what I before alluded to, namely, the great benefits ari&s;ing to man in con&s;equence of the Creator having made a <HI>plurality</HI> of worlds, &s;uch as our &s;y&s;tem is, con&s;i&s;ting of a central &s;un, and &s;ix worlds, be&s;ides &s;atellites, in preference to that of creating one world only of a va&s;t extent. It is an idea I have never lo&s;t &s;ight of, that all our knowledge of &s;cience is derived from the revolutions (exhibited to our eye, and from thence to our under&s;tanding) which tho&s;e &s;everal planets, or worlds, of which our &s;y&s;tem is compo&s;ed, make in their circuit round the &s;un.</P>
<P>Had then the quantity of matter which the&s;e &s;ix worlds contain been blended into one &s;olitary globe, the con&s;e|quence to us would have been, that either no revolution|ary motion would have exi&s;ted, or not a &s;ufficiency of it to give us the ideas and the knowledge of &s;cience we now have; and it is from the &s;ciences that all the mechanical arts that contribute &s;o much to our earthly felicity and comfort are derived.</P>
<P>As therefore the Creator made nothing in vain, &s;o al&s;o mu&s;t it be believed that he organized the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e in the mo&s;t advantageous manner for the benefit of man: and as we &s;ee, and from experience feel the benefits we derive from the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e, formed as it is, which benefits we &s;hould not have had the opportunity of enjoying, if the &s;tructure, &s;o far as relates to our &s;y&s;tem, had been a &s;olitary globe, we can di&s;cover, at lea&s;t, one rea&s;on why a <HI>plurality</HI> of worlds has been
<PB N="48" REF="027458_0047_0FD3DB0C9DB5FCD0">
made, and that rea&s;on calls forth the devotional gratitude of man, as well as his admiration.</P>
<P>But it is not to us, the inhabitants of this globe, only, that the benefits ari&s;ing from a plurality of worlds are limited. The inhabitants of each of the worlds, of which our &s;y&s;tem is compo&s;ed, enjoy the &s;ame opportu|nities of knowledge as we do. They behold the revolu|tionary motions of our earth, as we behold theirs. All the planets revolve in &s;ight of each other; and therefore the &s;ame univer&s;al &s;chool of &s;cience pre&s;ents it&s;elf to all.</P>
<P>Neither does the knowledge &s;top here. The &s;y&s;tem of worlds next to us, exhibits in its revolution the &s;ame principles and &s;chool of &s;cience to the inhabitants of their &s;y&s;tem, as our &s;y&s;tem does to us, and in like manner throughout the immen&s;ity of &s;pace.</P>
<P>Our ideas, not only of the Almightine&s;s of the Creator, but of his wi&s;dom and of his beneficence, be|come enlarged in proportion as we contemplate the ex|tent and the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e. The &s;olitary idea of a &s;olitary world rolling, or at re&s;t, in the immen&s;e ocean of &s;pace, gives place to the cheerful idea of a &s;o|ciety of worlds, &s;o happily contrived, as to admini&s;ter, even by their motion, in&s;truction to man. We &s;ee our own earth filled with abundance; but we forget to con|&s;ider how much of that abundance is owing to the &s;cien|tific knowledge the va&s;t machinery of the univer&s;e has un|folded.</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e reflections, what are we to think of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith that forms it&s;elf up|on the idea of only one world, and that of no greater ex|tent, as is before &s;hewn, than twenty-five thou&s;and miles? An extent, which a man walking at the rate of three miles an hour, for twelve hours in a day, could he keep on in a circular direction, would walk entirely round in le&s;s than two years. Alas! what is this to the mighty ocean of &s;pace, and the Almighty power of the Creator.</P>
<P>From whence then could ari&s;e the &s;olitary and &s;trange conceit that the Almighty, who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protection, &s;hould quit the care of all the re&s;t, and come to die in our world,
<PB N="49" REF="027458_0048_0FD3DB0CA26B5338">
becau&s;e, they &s;ay, one man and one woman had eaten an apple? And on the other hand, are we to &s;uppo&s;e that every world in the boundle&s;s creation, had an Eve, and apple, a &s;erpent, and a redeemer? In this ca&s;e, the per&s;on who is errevently called the Son of God, and &s;ometimes God him&s;elf, would have nothing el&s;e to do than to travel from world to world, in an endle&s;s &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of death with &s;carcely a momentary interval of life.</P>
<P>It has been, by rejecting the evidence, that the word, or works of God in the creation, affords to our &s;en&s;es, and the action of our rea&s;on upon that evidence, that &s;o many wild and whim&s;ical &s;y&s;tems of faith, and of religion, have been fabricated and &s;et up. There may be many &s;y&s;tems of religion, that, &s;o far from being morally bad, are in many re&s;pects morally good: but there can be but ONE that is true, and that one nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t, as it ever will, be in all things con&s;i&s;tent with the ever exi&s;ting word of God that we behold in his works. But &s;uch is the &s;trange con&s;truction of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith, that every evidence the heavens afford to man, either directly contra|dicts it, or renders it ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible to believe, and I always feel plea&s;ure in encouraging my&s;elf to believe it, that there have been men in the world who per&s;uaded them&s;elves that what is called <HI>a pious fraud,</HI> might, at lea&s;t under particular circum&s;tances be productive of &s;ome good. But the fraud being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, could not afterwards be ex|plained; for it is with a pious fraud, as with a bad action, it bege&s;s a calamitous nece&s;&s;ity of going on.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who fir&s;t preached the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of faith, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure combined with it the mor|ality preached by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, might per&s;uade them&s;elves that it was better than the heathen mythology that then prevailed. From the fir&s;t preachers, the fraud went on to the &s;econd, and to the third, till the idea of its being a pious fraud became lo&s;t in the belief of its being true; and that belief became again encouraged by the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who made a livelihood by preaching it.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="027458_0049_0FD3D9298C29A1D8">
But though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a belief might, by &s;uch means, be rendered almo&s;t general among the laity, it is next to im|po&s;&s;ible to account for the continual per&s;ecution carried on by the church, for &s;everal hundred years, again&s;t the &s;ciences and again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of &s;cience, if the church, had not &s;ome record or &s;ome tradition that it was origi|nally no other than a pious fraud, or did not fore&s;ee that it could not be maintained again&s;t the evidence that the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e afforded.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hewn the irreconcileable incon&s;i&s;|tencies between the real word of God exi&s;ting in the uni|ver&s;e, and that which is called <HI>the word of God,</HI> as &s;hewn to us in a printed book that any man might make, I pro|ceed to &s;peak of the three principal means that have been employed in all ages, and perhaps in all countries, to impo&s;e upon mankind.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e three means are, My&s;tery, Miracle, and Pro|phecy. The two fir&s;t are incompatible with true religion, and the third ought always to be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my&s;tery, every thing we behold is, in one &s;en&s;e a my&s;tery to us. Our own exi&s;tence is a my&s;tery; the whole vegetable world is a my&s;tery. We cannot account how it is that an acorn, when put into the ground, is made to develope it&s;elf and become an oak. We know now how it is that the feed we &s;ow un|folds and multiplies it&s;elf, and returns to us &s;uch an abundant intere&s;t for &s;o &s;mall a capital.</P>
<P>The fact, however, as di&s;tinct from the operating cau&s;e, is not a my&s;tery, becau&s;e we &s;ee it; and we know al&s;o the means we are to u&s;e, which is no other than put|ting the &s;eed into the ground. We know therefore as much as is nece&s;&s;ary for us to know; and that part of the operation that we do not know, and which if we did, we could not perform, the Creator takes upon him&s;elf and performs it for us. We are therefore better off than if we had been let into the &s;ecret, and left to do it for our|&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="027458_0050_0FD3DB120A954250">
But though every created thing is in this &s;en&s;e a my&s;tery, the word my&s;tery cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> applied to <HI>moral truth;</HI> any more than ob&s;curity can be applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth, and not a God of my&s;tery or ob&s;curity. My&s;tery is the antagoni&s;t of truth. It is a fog of human invention, that ob&s;cures truth, and repre&s;ents it in di&s;tortion. Truth never envelopes <HI>it&s;elf</HI> in my&s;tery; and the my&s;tery in which it is at any time enveloped, is the work of its an|tagoni&s;t, and never of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Religion, therefore, being the belief of a God, and the practice of moral truth, cannot have connection with my&s;tery. The belief of a God, &s;o far from having any thing of my&s;tery in it, is of all beliefs the mo&s;t ea&s;y, be|cau&s;e it ari&s;es to us, as is before ob&s;erved, out of nece&s;&s;ity. And the practice of moral truth, or in other words, a prac|tical imitation of the moral goodne&s;s of God, is no other than our acting towards each other, as he acts benignly to|wards all. We cannot <HI>&s;erve</HI> God in the manner we &s;erve tho&s;e who cannot do without &s;uch &s;ervice; and, there|fore, the only idea we can have of &s;erving God, is that of contributing to the happine&s;s of the living creation that God has made.

<P>The very nature and de&s;ign of religion, if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s it, prove, even to demon&s;tration, that it mu&s;t be free from every thing of my&s;tery, and uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cumbered with ev|ery thing that is my&s;terious. Religion, con&s;idered as a duty, is incumbent upon every living &s;oul alike, and therefore mu&s;t be on a level to the under&s;tanding and com|prehen&s;ion of all. Man does not learn religion as he learns the &s;ecrets and my&s;teries of a trade. He learns the theory of religion by reflection. It ari&s;es out of the action of his own mind upon the things which he &s;ees, or upon what he may happen to hear or to read, and the practice joins it&s;elf therto. When men, whether from policy or pious fraud, &s;et up &s;y&s;tems of religion incompatible with the word or works of God in the creation, and not only above, but repugnant to human comprehen&s;ion, they
<PB N="52" REF="027458_0051_0FD3DB120E8F3FC8">
were under the nece&s;&s;ity of inventing, or adopting a word that &s;hould &s;erve as a bar to all que&s;tions, inquiries and &s;peculations. The word <HI>my&s;tery</HI> an&s;wered this purpo&s;e; and thus it has happened that religion, which, in it&s;elf, is without my&s;tery, has been corrupted into a fog of my&s;|teries.</P>
<P>As <HI>my&s;tery</HI> an&s;wered all general purpo&s;es, <HI>miracle</HI> fol|lowed as an occa&s;ional auxiliary. The former &s;erved to be wilder the mind, the latter to puzzle the &s;en&s;e. The one was the lingo, the other the legerdemain.</P>
<P>But before going further into this &s;ubject, it will be proper to inquire what is to be under&s;tood by a miracle.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that every thing may be &s;aid to be a my&s;tery, &s;o al&s;o may it be &s;aid, that every thing is a miracle, and that no one thing is a greater miracle than another. The elephant, though larger, is not a greater miracle than a mite; nor a mountain a greater mir|acle than an at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m. To an Almighty power, it is no more difficult to make the one than the other, and no more difficult to make a million of worlds than to make one. Every thing therefore is a miracle in one &s;en&s;e; whil&s;t, in the other &s;en&s;e, there is no &s;uch thing as a mi|racle. It is a miracle, when compared to our power, and to our comprehen&s;ion. It is not a miracle, compared to the power that performs it. But as nothing in this de|&s;cription conveys the idea that is affixed to the word mi|racle, it is nece&s;&s;ary to carry the inquiry further.</P>
<P>Mankind have conceived to them&s;elves certain laws, by which, what they call nature is &s;uppo&s;ed to act; and that a miracle is &s;omething contrary to the operation and effect of tho&s;e laws. But unle&s;s we know the whole ex|tent of tho&s;e laws, and of what are commonly called the powers of nature, we are not able to judge whether any thing that may appear to us wonderful or miraculous, be within, or be beyond, or be contrary to, her natural power of acting.</P>
<P>The a&s;cen&s;ion of a man &s;everal miles high into the air, would have every thing in it that con&s;titutes the idea of a miracle, if it were not known that a &s;pecies of air can be generated &s;everal times lighter than the common

atmo&s;pheric air, and yet po&s;&s;e&s;s ela&s;ticity enough to pre|vent the balloon in which that light air is inclo&s;ed, from being compre&s;&s;ed into as many times le&s;s bulk, by the common air that &s;urrounds it. In like man|ner, extracting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">la&s;hes or &s;parks of fire from the hu|man body, as vi&s;ibly as from a &s;teel &s;truck with a &s;lint, and cau&s;ing iron or &s;teel to move without any vi&s;ible agent, would al&s;o give the idea of a miracle, if we were not acquainted with electricity and magneti&s;m: &s;o al&s;o would many other experiments in natural philo&s;ophy, to tho&s;e who are not acquainted, with the &s;ubject. The re&s;toring per&s;ons to life, who are to appearance dead, as is practi&s;ed upon drowned per&s;ons, would al&s;o be a mira|cle, if it were not known that animation is capable of being &s;u&s;pended, without being extinct.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are performances by &s;light of hand, and by per&s;ons acting in concert, that have a mi|raculous appearance, which, when known, are thought nothing of. And be&s;ides the&s;e, there are mechanical and optical deceptions. There is now an exhibition in Paris, of gho&s;ts or &s;pectres, which, thought it is not impo&s;ed up|on the &s;pectators as a fact, has an a&s;toni&s;hing appearance. As therefore we know not the extent to which nature or art can go, there is no po&s;itive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">riterion to determine what a miracle is; and mankind, in giving credit to ap|pearances, under the idea of their being miracles, are &s;ubject to be continually impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>Since then appearances are &s;o capable of deceiving, and things not real have a &s;trong re&s;emblance to things that are, nothing can be more incon&s;i&s;tent than to &s;up|po&s;e that the Almighty would make u&s;e of means, &s;uch as are called miracles, that would &s;ubject the per&s;on who performed them to the &s;u&s;picion of being an impo&s;tor, and the per&s;ons who related them to be &s;u&s;pected of lying, and the doctrine intended to be &s;upported thereby, to be &s;u&s;pected as a fabulous invention.</P>
<P>Of all the modes of evidence that ever were invented to obtain belief to any &s;y&s;tem or opinion, to which the name of religion has been given, that of <HI>miracle,</HI> how|ever

&s;ucce&s;sful the impo&s;ition may have been, is the mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent. For, in the fir&s;t place, whenever recour&s;e is had to &s;how, for the purpo&s;e of procuring that belief (for a miracle, under any idea of the word, is a &s;how) it im|plies a lamene&s;s or weakne&s;s in the doctrine that is preached. And, in the &s;econd place, it is degrading the Almighty into the character of a &s;how-man, playing tricks to amu&s;e and make the people &s;tare and wonder. It is al&s;o the mo&s;t equivocal &s;ort of evidence that can be &s;et up; for the belief is not to depend upon the thing called a miracle, but upon the credit of the reporter, who &s;ays that he &s;aw it; and therefore the thing, were it true, would have no better chance of being believed than if it were a lie.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I were to &s;ay, that when I &s;at down to write this book, a hand pre&s;ented it&s;elf in the air, took up the pen, and wrote every word that is herein written; would any body believe me? certainly they would not. Would they believe me a whit the more if the thing had been a fact? certainly they would not. Since, then, a real miracle, were it to happen, would be &s;ubject to the &s;ame fate as the fal&s;hood, the incon&s;i&s;tency becomes the greater, of &s;uppo&s;ing the Almighty would make u&s;e of means that would not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which they were intended, even if it were real.</P>
<P>If we were to &s;uppo&s;e a miracle to be &s;omething &s;o entirely out of the cour&s;e of what is called nature, that &s;he mu&s;t go out of that cour&s;e to accompli&s;h it; and we &s;ee an account given of &s;uch miracle by the per&s;on who &s;aid he &s;aw it, it rai&s;es a que&s;tion in the mind, very ea&s;ily decided; which is, Is it more probable that nature &s;hould go out of her cour&s;e, or that a man &s;hould tell a lie? We have never &s;een in our time, nature go out of her cour&s;e, but we have good rea&s;on to believe that millions of lies have been told in the &s;ame time; it is, therefore, at lea&s;t millions to one, that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of the whale &s;wallowing Jonah, though a whale is large enough to do it, borders greatly on the mar|vellous; but it would have approached nearer to the idea
<PB N="55" REF="027458_0054_0FD4403C6B6F4728">
of a miracle, if Jonah had &s;wallowed the whale. In this ca&s;e, which may &s;erve for all ca&s;es of miracles, the matter would decide it&s;elf as before &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ated, namely, Is it more probable that a man &s;hould have &s;wallowed a whale, or told a lie?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing that Jonah had really &s;wallowed the whale, and gone with it in his belly to Nineveh, and to convince the people that it was true, have ca&s;t it up in their &s;ight of the full length and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of a whale, would they not have believed him to have been the devil in&s;tead of a prophet? Or, if the whale had carried Jonah to Nin|eveh, and ca&s;t him up in the &s;ame public manner, would they not have believed the whale to have been the devil, and Jonah, one of his imps?</P>
<P>The mo&s;t extraordinary of all the things called mir|acles, related in the New Te&s;tament, is that of the devil flying away with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and carrying him to the top of a high mountain; and to the top of the highe&s;t pinna|cle of the temple, and &s;howing him, and promi&s;ing to him <HI>aid the kingdoms of the world.</HI> How happened it that he did not di&s;cover America? or is it only with <HI>king|doms</HI> that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> highne&s;s has any intere&s;t?</P>
<P>I have too much re&s;pect for the moral character of Chri&s;t, to believe that he told this whale of a miracle him&s;elf; neither is it ea&s;y to account for what purpo&s;e it could have been fabricated, unle&s;s it were to impo&s;e upon the connoi&s;&s;eurs of miracles, as is &s;ometimes practi&s;ed up|on the connoi&s;&s;eurs of Queen Anne's farthings, and collectors of relics and antiquities; or to render the belief of miracles rediculous, by outdoing miracle, as Don Quix|ote outdid chivalry; or to embarra&s;s the belief of miracles by making it doubtful by what power, whether of God, or of the devil, any thing called a miracle was performed. It requires, however, a great deal of faith in the devil to belief this miracle.</P>
<P>In every point of view, in which tho&s;e things called miracles can be placed and con&s;idered, the reality of them is improbable, and their exi&s;tence unnece&s;&s;ary. They would not, as before ob&s;erved, an&s;wer any u&s;eful purpo&s;e, even if they were true; for it is more difficult to obtain belief

to a miracle, than to a principle evidently mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> any miracle. Moral principle &s;peaks univer&s;ally for it&s;elf, Miracle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould be but a thing of the moment, and &s;een but by a few; after this, it requires a transfer of faith, from God to man, to believe a miracle upon man's re|port. In&s;tead therefore of admitting the recitals of mira|cles, as evidence of any &s;y&s;tem of religion being true, they ought to be con&s;idered as &s;ymptoms of its being fabulous. It is necessary to the full and upright character of truth, that it rejects the crutch; and it is con&s;i&s;tent with the character of fable, to &s;eek the aid that truth re|jects. Thus much for my&s;tery and miracle.</P>
<P>As my&s;tery and miracle took charge of the pa&s;t and the pre&s;ent, prophecy took charge of the future, and rounded the ten&s;es of faith. It was not &s;ufficient to know what had been done, but what would be done. The &s;up|po&s;ed prophet was the &s;uppo&s;ed hi&s;torian of times to come; and if he happened, in &s;hooting with a long bow of a thou&s;and years, to &s;trike within a thou&s;and miles of a mark, the ingenuity of po&s;terity could make it point blank; and if he happened to be directly wrong; it was only to &s;uppo&s;e, as in the ca&s;e of Jonah and Ninevah, that God had repented him&s;elf, and changed his mind. What a fool do fabulous &s;y&s;tems of religion make of man!</P>
<P>IT has been &s;hewn in a former part of this work, that the original meaning of the words <HI>prophet</HI> and <HI>pro|phe&s;ying</HI> has been changed, and that a prophet, in the &s;en&s;e the word is now u&s;ed, is a creature of modern in|vention; and it is owing to this change in the meaning of the words, that the flights and metaphors of the Jewi&s;h poets, and phra&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions now rendered ob&s;cure by our not being acquainted with the local circum&s;tances to which they applied at the time they were u&s;ed, have been erected into prophe&s;ies, and made to bend to expla|nations at the will and whim&s;ical conceits of &s;ectaries, ex|pounders, and commentators. Every thing unintelligible
<PB N="57" REF="027458_0056_0FD44042A8A21598">
was prophetical, and every thing in&s;ignificant was typical. A blunder would have &s;erved for prophecy; and a di&s;h|clout for a type.</P>
<P>If by a prophet we are to &s;uppo&s;e a man to whom the Almighty communicated &s;ome event that would take place in future, either there were &s;uch men, or there were not. If there were, it is con&s;i&s;tent to believe that the event, &s;o communicated, would be told in terms that could be under&s;tood, and not related in &s;uch a loo&s;e and ob&s;cure manner as to be out of the comprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e that heard it, and &s;o equivocal as to fit almo&s;t any circum&s;tance that might happen afterwards. It is con|ceiving very irreverently of the Almighty to &s;uppo&s;e he would deal in this j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ting manner with mankind&punc; yet all the things called prophecies, in the book called the Bi|ble, come under this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>But it is with prophecy, as it is with miracle. It could not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e even if it were real. Tho&s;e to whom a prophecy &s;hould be told, could not tell whether the man prophe&s;ied or lied, or whether it had been re|vealed to him, or whether he conceited it: and if the thing that the prophe&s;ied, or pretended to prophecy, &s;hould happen, or &s;omething like it among the multiude of things that are daily happening, nobody could again know whether he foreknew it, or gue&s;&s;ed at it, or whether it was accidental. A prophet, therefore, is a character u&s;e|le&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary: and the &s;afe &s;ide of the ca&s;e is, to guard again&s;t being impo&s;ed upon by not giving credit to &s;uch relations.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, my&s;tery, miracle, and prophecy, are appendages that belong to fabulous and not to true religion. They are the means by which &s;o many <HI>Lo heres!</HI> and <HI>Lo theres!</HI> have been &s;pread about the world, and religion been made into a trade. The &s;ucce&s;s of one impo&s;tor gave encouragement to another, and the quieting &s;alvo of doing <HI>&s;ome</HI> good by keeping up a <HI>pious fraud,</HI> protected them from remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Having now extended the &s;ubject to a greater length than I fir&s;t intended, I &s;hall bring it to a clo&s;e, by ab|&s;tracting a &s;ummary from the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="027458_0057_0FD440449BFC8918">
Fir&s;t, That the idea or belief of a word of God ex|i&s;ting in print, or in writing or in &s;peech, is incon&s;i&s;tent in it&s;elf for the rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned. The&s;e rea&s;ons, among many others, are the want of a univer&s;al language; the mutability of language; the errors to which tran&s;la|tions are &s;ubject; the po&s;&s;ibility of totally &s;uppressing &s;uch a word; the probability of altering it, or of fabri|cating the whole, and impo&s;ing it upon the world.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the creation we behold, is the real and ever-exi&s;ting word of God, in which we cannot be deceived. It proclaimeth his power, it demon&s;trates his wi&s;dom, it manife&s;ts his goodne&s;s and beneficence.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the moral duty of man con&s;i&s;ts in imitating the moral goodne&s;s and beneficence of God man|ife&s;ted in the creation towards all his creatures. That &s;eeing, as we daily do, the goodne&s;s of God to all men, it is an example, calling upon all men to practi&s;e the &s;ame towards each other; and con&s;equently that every thing of per&s;ecution and revenge between man and man, and every thing of cruelty to animals, is a violation of moral duty.</P>
<P>I trouble not my&s;elf about the manner of future ex|i&s;tence. I content my&s;elf with believing, even to po&s;i|tive conviction, that the power that gave me exi&s;tence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he plea&s;es, eith|er with or without this body; and it appears more prob|able to me, that I &s;hall continue to exi&s;t hereafter, than that I &s;hould have had exi&s;tence, as I now have, before that exi&s;tence began.</P>
<P>It is certain that, in one point, all nations of the earth and all religions agree. All believe in a God. The things in which they di&s;agree, are the redundancies annex|ed to that belief; and therefore, if ever an univer&s;al relig|ion &s;hould prevail, it will not be believing any thing new, but in getting rid of redundancies, and believing as man believed at fir&s;t. Adam, if ever there was &s;uch a man, was created a Dei&s;t; but in the mean time let every man fol|low, as he has a right to do, the religion and the wor&s;hip he prefers.</P>
