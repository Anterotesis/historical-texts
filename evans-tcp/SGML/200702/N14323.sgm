<HEAD>LETTER III. Mi&s;s RIVERS to Mi&s;s ELIZA DUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>OF how much happine&s;s am I deprived by the lo&s;s of my &s;weet friend and companion. Dreary now appears this malancholy enclo&s;ure&mdash;&s;o the world calls it; but never till my Eliza's departure did it wear a gloomy a&s;pect to her Harriot; happy in your &s;ociety, guarded by pious precepts from the love of a tumul|tuous world, of which I know nothing, but from the de&s;cription of tho&s;e who&s;e intere&s;t it now is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dwell only on the dark &s;ide of the picture.</P>
<P>I was perfectly content with my tranquil retreat: With what chearful alacrity did you and I enter in|to our innocent amu&s;ements; not a moment of our time hung heavy on our hands;&mdash;but, &s;ince &s;epara|ted from you, I feel an aching void in my heart; our little recreations have, to me, lo&s;t their charms; I &s;till &s;ee round me the &s;ame &s;erene, contented coun|tenances, but I &s;ee none to whom I can, with unli|mited&punc; freedom, unbo&s;om my&s;elf: I like and e&s;teem them; but 'tis a cool &s;entiment, compar'd to what I experienced for you.

your joy, at being again received into the arms of a ten|der mother, by my complaints; rather let me congra|tulate you on your felicity: A mother! O my friend! the very mention of that endearing name, fills my eyes with tears. Long, long, have I been deprived of mine: But, young as I was, when I enjoyed that ine&s;|timable ble&s;&s;ing, &s;trongly is it impre&s;&s;ed on my me|mory; I love to recollect her tenderne&s;s on the&s;e occa|&s;ions. I &s;eem &s;till to feel her ki&s;&s;es on my cheek, and fancy my &s;elf pre&s;&s;ed to her maternal bo&s;om. She is no more! Yet let me not repine, I have &s;till a parent left: But it &s;eems natural to our &s;ex to be more fondly attached to the mother, than the father. I reverence the latter, but my affection is mixed with awe; a ha&s;ty word from him agitates my whole frame; while his &s;miles excite only a &s;ort of doubtful joy: A joy, alloyed by the fear of inadvertently doing, or &s;aying &s;omething that may di&s;pel the &s;un&s;hine of his counte|nance, and &s;ub&s;titute a cloud in its place. Whereas, had I a mother, I feel that my heart would expand it&s;elf in her pre&s;ence; I would pre&s;ume to make her the con|fidant of all my little &s;ecrets: Her feminine &s;oftne&s;s would encourage me; on the contrary, my father's manly dignity, adds to my natural timidity; perhaps I &s;hould be more at ea&s;e in his pre&s;ence, were I of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ner ad|mitted to it; but though he frequently takes a trip to Paris. I enjoy at the grate but little of his company: My fir&s;t emotions at the &s;ight of him, are always of the mo&s;t agreeable nature; but he no &s;ooner beholds me, than his native vivacity is exchanged for a melancholy pen&s;ive air; for &s;ome moments he continues lo&s;t in thought&punc; his vi&s;its are &s;hort, and he &s;eems to leave me without regret.</P>
<P>Perhaps, my dear, I have before now troubled you with the above remarks. Pardon me,&mdash;what led me to

After our fir&s;t congratulations were over, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed his impatience to &s;ee Harriot; her idea, &s;aid he, haunts me perpetually; and yet my good friend, in &s;pite of the &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions I experience in her fa|vor, fate may not have de&s;tined me the happine&s;s of being allied to you; I mu&s;t take the liberty to hope, that my choice is &s;till free, and that no offence will be taken&mdash;he pau&s;ed:&mdash;I ea&s;ily under&s;tood his meaning, and as ea&s;ily di&s;&s;ipated his delicate apprehen&s;ions; he took his leave, promi&s;ing to attend me next morning at twelve to the important interview.</P>
<P>I wrote a note to Harriot, informing her of our in|tentions; but in regard to Lord O&s;&s;ory, I only &s;aid, I &s;hall bring with me a young gentleman who is de&s;irous

of being introduced to you. I own I did not wi&s;h Bell to be pre&s;ent, therefore forebore to mention her in my billet&mdash;the hour arrived,&mdash;and punctual to his time his Lord&s;hip arrived al&s;o elegantly dre&s;&s;ed;&mdash;we &s;et off; during our little ride, he was vi&s;ibly agitated, I was not my&s;elf ab&s;olutely indifferent as to the i&s;&s;ue of our vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Harriot made her appearance with a mode&s;t air and downca&s;t eye, &s;he gave, by her not having in the lea&s;t degree altered the plain dre&s;s &s;he wears in common, a proof that &s;he had either very little vanity, or a great deal of pride; this at fir&s;t glance appears a paradox. Rou&s;&s;eau has explained it in the de&s;cription of his So|phia: her dre&s;s however, is always elegant and &s;imple, and &s;eemingly un&s;tudied; &s;he looked pretty, at lea&s;t in my eyes; the &s;entimental expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance, would, I thought, &s;uit the ta&s;te of Lord O&s;&s;ory.</P>
<P>She received me with her u&s;ual re&s;pect, then turn|ed to his Lord&s;hip, who I pre&s;ented to her; &s;he timidly rai&s;ed her eyes to his face, in&s;tantly her's was &s;uffu&s;ed with blu&s;hes; but a moment after, &s;he grew pale: in a faltering accent &s;he returned his compli|ment. I never &s;aw her &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed; he on the contrary appeared perfectly at ea&s;e; he examined her with attention, but in a manner delicately cautious le&s;t his glances &s;hould add to her already apparent confu&s;ion: not a look of either e&s;caped my notice. I had no rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with the &s;erenity in his; I &s;aw only a cool approbation: but in hers,&mdash;I wi&s;h the girl may be able to &s;top at that. While things were in this &s;ituation, a &s;i&s;ter came to inform me, that my niece begged leave to pay her re&s;pects&mdash;&s;ly gip&s;y, &s;he had &s;een my note:&mdash;not to me, but to Lord O&s;|&s;ory did &s;he intend the compliment&mdash;In &s;he &s;wam, adorned with all the charms that nature could be&s;tow, and embeli&s;hed with every ornament which a delicate

female fancy could &s;elect; I never &s;aw &s;uch a blaze of charms. Harriot, for the fir&s;t time in her life. I mu&s;t do her the ju&s;tice to believe, felt a momentary &s;en&s;a|tion of envy; &s;he changed colour, and involuntarily retreated a few paces to make way for her too power|ful rival.&mdash;This motion &s;eemed to &s;ay&mdash;I give up the unequal conte&s;t.&mdash;Bell approached the grate with all the town-bred ea&s;e of a fine lady&mdash;graceful her air, in&s;i|nuating her &s;miles. Lord O&s;&s;ory was transfixed into a &s;tatute&mdash;the &s;tatute of admiration&mdash;&s;he &s;poke&mdash;the harmony of her voice, her &s;prightly wit completed her triumph.&mdash;He gazed, he li&s;tened with rapture,&mdash;in|voluntary prai&s;es bur&s;t from his lips.&mdash;I had &s;een enough&mdash;too much, &s;o aro&s;e to take my leave:&mdash;with vi&s;ible reluctance, he followed my example: his eyes quitted not the lovely object, till the envious door &s;hut the delightful vi&s;ion from his &s;ight. I was not in a hu|mor to hear him tell me, as I &s;aw he was preparing to do, that my girl had not an&s;wered his expectations. I therefore pretended indi&s;pen&s;ible bu&s;ine&s;s, and politely paying my compliments, hurried from him. And now Sir Harry I expect to &s;ee you here That your daughter has made a conque&s;t is pa&s;t a doubt; the alli|ance is every way de&s;irable,&mdash;pardon me, but I mu&s;t &s;ay, that it is much better than &s;he de&s;erves:&mdash;her late adventure, I do not mean to call her virtue in que&s;tion, we mu&s;t however allow that it was highly indi&s;creet. I check my pen on this &s;ubject, there is a late in mar|riage&mdash;always have I remarked that to hear a batchelor, who is not in love, de&s;cribe his future wife, is po&s;itive|ly to know that when he comes to make his choice, &s;he will be the very rever&s;e of what he then thinks he &s;hall approve.&mdash;O man! of what u&s;e is thy boa&s;t|ed rea&s;on! Adieu! let me know it I may hope for your pre&s;ence. My fir&s;t pro&s;pect has been fruitle&s;s,
<PB N="39" REF="018142_0038_0FA562B7A551ECB0">
but I have another in re&s;erve, of the &s;ucce&s;s of which. I cannot doubt:&mdash;my old friend Mrs. Williams, has made overtures for her &s;on,&mdash;the young man is neither to be much liked, or much di&s;liked&mdash;one of the com|mon medly mortals, that make up the throng.&mdash;It is time my girl were &s;ettled in life,&mdash;till then, I &s;hall ne|ver be truly at ea&s;e, nor can I till then indulge my|&s;elf in my wi&s;h for retirement. Mr. Williams then mu&s;t be the man,&mdash;in&s;tantly will I write to his mother:&mdash;my daughter has been accu&s;tomed to obey,&mdash;on her part I fear not any oppo&s;ition: this is my pre&s;ent plan, come and &s;ee it executed.&mdash;I think we have now a fair pro&s;|pect of getting rid of both our plagues.&mdash;Farewel, be|lieve me</P>

I dread the con&s;equence of unnece&s;&s;ary delay: I have yielded but to&mdash;what purpo&s;e can it an&s;wer; you mu&s;t ere long, give your hand to Mr. Williams; nothing &s;hall tempt me to violate the promi&s;e I have made both to him and his mother; I expect therefore that you will conquer your fooli&s;h prejudice, and prepare your&s;elf to receive him as your intended hu&s;band: Lord O&s;&s;ory has, at my reque&s;t invited him to be pre&s;ent at his nuptials, in a few moments he will be here.</Q> (I &s;tarted and changed colour.) "None of your female airs and graces," continued my father; <Q>I am determined not to be trifled with; your fate is determined; I called you a&s;ide in order to prepare you for his vi&s;it: this you mu&s;t allow is acting with all the tenderne&s;s of a parent; do you in return, act with that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive duty which be|comes a child.

I was not mi&s;taken: in a few moments, a tall&punc; aukward figure entered the room, dre&s;&s;ed with inelegant finery, tho' early in the morning&mdash;I was going, my dear Eliza, to repeat the fooli&s;h compliments he paid me; but I have not patience to dwell on the hated &s;ubject: his conver&s;ation was interlarded with &s;craps of plays, the

Du|ring breakfa&s;t, I contrived to make my e&s;cape to the other &s;ide of the table, leaving him next to Lady Bab, who was plea&s;ed with an opportunity of &s;hewing her talents for wit and ridicule: &s;he played him off mo&s;t unmercifully, to the great entertainment of Sir Harry, and the great di&s;plea&s;ure of my father, who &s;everely chid me with his eyes for having changed my &s;eat.

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. The SAME to the SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AT length I return to my favorite amu&s;ement. I have been very ill my dear Eliza. My fever was violent while it la&s;ted. To-day, for the fir&s;t time. I took a &s;hort airing, accompanied by my maid. The re&s;t of the family are too much engaged with their plea|&s;ures to dedicate any of their time to a poor, low-&s;pirit|ed invalid: I ought however, in ju&s;tice, to except the amiable O&s;&s;ory. Nothing could equal his friendly anxiety for me during my illne&s;s. Every hour of the day did he call at the door of my apartment to enquire how I did. The mo&s;t &s;kilful phy&s;icians, were, by his order, &s;ent for from town&mdash;my father al&s;o behaved with a tenderne&s;s which excites in my brea&s;t the warme&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude. But it was my cou&s;in on whom I meant ju&s;tly to reflect, when I talked of being ne|glected: neither her or her friend Lady Bab once con|de&s;cended to honor me with a vi&s;it; both violently ap|prehen&s;ive of fevers, it &s;eems. Such was their excu&s;e. Mr. Williams, hone&s;t man, never having been accu&s;|tomed to think or act for him&s;elf, did as he &s;aw the re&s;t do. When they expre&s;&s;ed &s;orrow for my illne&s;s, he endeavoured to look &s;orrowful; when they &s;ent up to enquire after me, he followed their lead, and joined in the ceremony. This account I had from Sally, who added, that he was very a&s;&s;iduous about Lady Bab Wilmot. Heaven grant &s;he may have made a con|que&s;t of him. I doubt not but her Lady&s;hip would &s;nap at &s;uch an offer, as her rank is much &s;uperior to her fortune. I was near a fortnight confined to my room, and &s;till find my&s;elf extremely weak and languid. My indi&s;po&s;ition needed not to have confined me &s;o

long, but I wi&s;hed to be retired: I trembled at the thoughts of being again expo&s;ed to the too attractive graces of Lord O&s;&s;ory's conver&s;ation. I &s;pent my time in endeavouring, by the aids of religion and philo&s;ophy, to cure my heart of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s now criminal weakne&s;s. I flat|tered my&s;elf that I had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ucceeded; and therefore entered the parlour where the company were a&s;&s;embled with an air of compo&s;ure, placing great confidence in the &s;trength of my laudable re&s;olutions. Fortunately Lord O&s;&s;ory had rode out to pay &s;ome morning vi&s;its, and was not yet returned. I found only Lady O&s;&s;ory, Lady Bab, my uncle, Mr. Williams, and Mon&s;ieur La Fare. The latter &s;at by my cou&s;in, tuning her guitar; Sir Harry was engaged at piquet with Lady Bab; and Mr. Williams was amu&s;ing him|&s;elf with her lady&s;hip's netting, at which he is very ex|pert. Such was the arrangement of the little party. Lady O&s;&s;ory looked like an angel; the country air had given an additional glow to her fine complexion; and her morning dre&s;s was inimitably becoming. The agreeable Frenchman &s;eemed, by the homage he paid her with his large black eyes, to be perfectly &s;en&s;ible of her attractions. You mu&s;t permit me to give you a &s;light &s;ketch of this gentleman's hi&s;tory. As Lord O&s;&s;ory's friend, he de&s;erves the honor of being intro|duced to my Eliza. I know not my&s;elf the particulars of his &s;tory, which, I am told, is uncommonly unfortu|nate: all I have hitherto learnt is, that he is de&s;cend|ed from a younger branch of a noble family; that in con&s;equence of a love affair, he fought a duel, and killed his antagoni&s;t, who&s;e rank and power being &s;uperior to his, obliged him to fly his country, where no pardon was to be hoped for; that in leaving his country he was al&s;o obliged to leave all he had, e&s;caping only with his life.&mdash;He changed his name,
<PB N="63" REF="018142_0062_0FA562D070219820">
and fled to Holland, I think it was at Bru&s;&s;els; that fortune, weary of per&s;ecuting him, pre&s;ented him with an opportunity of rendering a &s;ignal &s;ervice to Lord O&s;&s;ory, who was on his travels. Of what nature this &s;ervice was. I have not yet been infor|med; but from that moment the generous young Engli&s;hman took him under his protection. He ac|companied his patron hither: as &s;oon as they arrived here, Lord O&s;&s;ory, who&s;e favors are rendered dou|bly valuable, by the noble delicacy with which they are conferred, made him independent, by &s;ettling on him a very con&s;iderable annuity; he lives with his bene|factor from choice; is treated with &s;o much re&s;pect by all the dome&s;tics, and has &s;o much command in the family, that one can hardly tell which of the two is ma&s;|ter. My Lord doats on him: and indeed he is &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble, &s;o agreeably gay, and in every re&s;pect &s;o accom|pli&s;hed, that one cannot wonder that he &s;hould gain &s;uch an a&s;cendency over his worthy friend. He has, it &s;eems, propo&s;ed him&s;elf, as a proof of his gratitude, to become tutor to Lord O&s;&s;ory's &s;on and heir, if hea|ven &s;hould ble&s;s him with one&mdash;a ta&s;k for which he ap|pears admirably qualified. For this purpo&s;e, he is en|gaged in abridging Ro&s;&s;eau's Sy&s;tem of Education,&mdash;&s;electing what is practicable, and omitting what he and Lord O&s;&s;ory think exceptionable. This man is tho't, by the belles of our &s;ociety, uncommonly hand&s;ome: he is very well for a foreigner;&mdash;but I mu&s;t own, his chief recommendation to me is, his being honored with the friend&s;hip of Lord O&s;&s;ory. This &s;ubject has run away with my pen. I was going to de&s;cribe the recep|tion I met with.&mdash;Mr. Williams was the fir&s;t who e&s;pi|ed me. As I entered the room, he &s;tarted up, and with ridiculous empha&s;is repeated,</P>

While every one was thus di&s;playing their wit at that poor man's expence, he was, at the expence of my Dre&s;den ruffles, endeavouring to di&s;engage his netting pin, which in handing me to a &s;eat, he had aukwardly entangled in them. "I u&s;ed to wi&s;h," &s;aid Lady Bab, <Q>to have our beaus about town, taught a little needle-work, or netting, to keep them out of mi&s;chief; but I find Mr. Willi|ams has &s;uch a happy nack of doing every thing, that the very thing which I propo&s;ed as a remedy, is, in his hands, the cau&s;e of&mdash;</Q> "Spare him," inter|rupted La Fare, laughing, <Q>for if he &s;hould unfortu|nately

Unhappy guilty Harriot, Guilty! no, my pa&s;&s;ion is free from every ba&s;e alloy; 'tis more tender than friendly; but no le&s;s pure. My heart harbours not a wi&s;h in regard to O&s;&s;ory, but what I dur&s;t avow to all the world; and yet he has &s;uch &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that too &s;u&s;ceptible heart that I cannot govern its emotions in favor of any other. I will be virtuous, that is all I can an&s;wer for. My Eliza de&s;erves unlimited confidence&mdash;I mu&s;t tell you&mdash;do not too &s;e|verely condemn me.

We were alone the other day in the park. What a variety of emotions does the recollection excite! I was too much agitated, too much confu&s;ed at the time to know the particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed; I only remember that he was at my feet; that in the plaintive voice of woe he lamented his wretched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate, in having cho&s;e my cou&s;in;&mdash;that he now too late found I alone was for|med to make him happy; that he had mi&s;taken admi|ration for love; love!

My courage began to fail me, terrified at the fierce wildne&s;s of his air. The man was certainly out of his &s;en&s;es. I conde&s;cended to &s;ooth him; he paid not the &s;lighte&s;t attention to what I &s;aid: Nur&s;e was all this time bu&s;y in admini&s;tering medicines to re&s;tore her la|dy; but with as little &s;ucce&s;s as I found in attempting to quiet my Lord's violent emotions: At la&s;t, how|ever, his &s;pirits were quite exhau&s;ted; he turned to Harriot with a mournful air, gazed a few moments in &s;ilence, then exclaimed,&mdash;yes, &s;he is gone forever, and to me &s;he owes her death: The la&s;t words were hardly articulate: he cla&s;ped his hands, and uttering a deep groan, down he fell, like a tragedy hero, by the &s;ide of his dulcinea.</P>
<P>I now began to be alarmed at Harriot's long in&s;en&s;i|bility, and feared that La Fare's drug was not of &s;o in|nocent a nature as we had imagined, for death was painted on her pale countenance.

La Fare, as the nur&s;e &s;ays, &s;poke of Harriot's conduct as it &s;eemed to de&s;erve; my Lord took fire, called him a villain, &s;aid it was time to wipe off the &s;tain he had ca&s;t upon his honor; your intrigues, your vile ingratitude, is no &s;ecret to me; but my mind, till now, was too much engro&s;&s;ed by worthier objects, to find lei&s;ure to inflict on you the puni&s;hment you merit. Much more was &s;aid, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, but nur&s;e's memory reached no farther: She &s;creamed with all her force; Harriot too recovered her &s;en&s;es, and frantic with terror, &s;prung from the bed, and threw her&s;elf between the combatants. At that mo|ment Melvill fortunately made his appearance, the &s;cene changed, deadly weapons were ca&s;t a&s;ide, the bleeding O&s;&s;ory &s;upported the fainting Harriot. Melvill, <HI>en|de&s;e&s;poir,</HI> kneeled at her feet: La Fare was carried to his own apartment by my orders; no one el&s;e troubled their head about the poor Frenchman. After a proper bu&s;tle, my Lord was al&s;o carried off the &s;tage, in&s;en&s;i|ble with lo&s;s of blood. Harriot is replaced in her bed, which, it is believed, &s;he will never quit more; death &s;eems to have marked her for his own, in defiance of all his rivals; the expected nuptial bed, will now be exchanged for the &s;ilent tomb.

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. From the SAME to the SAME.</HEAD>
<P>YES, Eliza, I have indeed a mother, a mother who has been le&s;s guilty, but not le&s;s unfortunate than her daughter. In her &s;ympathizing bo&s;om. I have da|red to pour out my grief; I have told her all my fatal &s;tory. She bathed me with her tears.&mdash;Alas! even tho&s;e pure, tho&s;e precious drops, cannot wipe out the &s;tain of my di&s;honor; nor can her pardon, her &s;oothing pi|ty, or her kind maternal care, &s;ave me from the grave, to that I now make quick advances. I am almo&s;t re|duced to a &s;keleton; my con&s;umption is pa&s;&s;ed all cure; fre&s;h air and a&s;&s;es milk ju&s;t keep me alive, and that is all.&mdash;Well might my amiable mother be in doubt, whether or not to claim me as her daughter; nature pleaded for me in her brea&s;t, or I am &s;o unlike the blooming, happy, innocent creature, I was ten years ago, that none but a mother could have known me.</P>
<P>Eliza, you have almo&s;t reached the la&s;t page of my &s;ad &s;tory; one &s;cene more, and you may clo&s;e the book forever; till that arrives, the intermediate &s;pace will be a mere blank: to fill that blank, give me leave to treat you with a melancholy tale, in which my dear mother is the principal character.</P>
<P>She is of a noble family, but her fortune was &s;mall&punc; neverthele&s;s, her per&s;onal attractions were &s;o great, that
<PB N="114" REF="018142_0111_0FA561E06D0C64F8">
even from a child, &s;he was &s;urrounded with admirers. My grand-father had a country &s;eat near Wind&s;or:&mdash;When my mother was about fifteen, &s;he, for the fir&s;t time, made her public appearance at a ball in that town; &s;everal of the Eaton &s;cholars were there; among&s;t the re&s;t, Lord W&mdash;'s &s;econd &s;on, a hand&s;ome youth: he danced with her, was &s;truck with her beauty, and from that moment became her admirer.&mdash;He was not remarkable for interior accompli&s;hments; but he flat|tered agreeably, and was too gay and too a&s;&s;iduous, not to plea&s;e a young unexperienced girl, who was hardly out of her leading &s;trings;&mdash;they parted with mutual regret;&mdash;it was not long ere they met again. At length, in a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate epi&s;tle, he declared his love; and having no hopes, that either of their parents would con&s;ent to the match, propo&s;ed a jaunt to Scot|land&mdash;The lady liked him, but her attachment was far from being &s;o indi&s;creetly violent as his: &s;he an&s;wered not his letter; he wrote again:&mdash;terrified at the tho'ts of a clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence, again&s;t which &s;he had received &s;o many cautions, &s;he prudently re&s;olved to reveal the whole affair to her mother:&mdash;She received the prai&s;es &s;o ju&s;tly merited for a conduct &s;o laudable. Her father in&s;tantly wrote to Lord W&mdash;. The youth was &s;ent on his travels;&mdash;a new lover &s;oon pre|&s;ented him&s;elf to &s;upply his place&mdash;a lover every way unexceptionable. My mother was not long ere &s;he became &s;en&s;ible of the wide difference between Mr. Ri|vers and Mr. W&mdash;: She now found that &s;he had never loved the latter, and that the former was the only man who ever had, or ever could make an impre&s;&s;ion on her heart. In &s;hort, with the con&s;ent and approba|tion of all parties, they were married, and for more than three years, nothing could equal their felicity. My father perfectly doated on his charming wife, and &s;he
<PB N="115" REF="018142_0112_0FA561E128A6B918">
almo&s;t adored her hu&s;band. About ten months after their union, your unfortunate Harriot fir&s;t made her appearance in this world of wretchedne&s;s.&mdash;I became the idol of both, and the more &s;o, as for near three years after my birth, there was no pro&s;pect of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rea&s;e to their family.</P>
<P>At this time M. W&mdash;, now Lord W&mdash;, by the death of his father and elder brother, returned to England, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new dignity: neither time nor ab&s;ence had weakened his attachment to my mother: he had indeed forborne to write, not doubt|ing but his letters would be intercepted: now, how|ever, he flattered him&s;elf, that every ob&s;tacle was re|moved. What then was his cruel di&s;appointment, when the fir&s;t news he heard on his return, was her marriage with Mr. Rivers! He raved, &s;tormed, and vowed revenge for her incon&s;tancy; nay, ra&s;h and im|petuous by nature, he vowed &s;he &s;hould &s;till be his, ei|ther by &s;tratagem or force! The fir&s;t &s;tep he took was to cau&s;e a report to be &s;pread, in order to excite my father's jealou&s;y, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> my mother had been compelled by the arbitrary will of her parents, to give her hand to one man, while another had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart; he was named as the latter:&mdash;Ambiguous and cen&s;ori|ous hints were dropped in regard to their private meet|ings.</P>
<P>To corroborate the&s;e reports. Lord W&mdash;, unin|vited, made his appearance at Rivers' Park, where he behaved to my mother in a manner &s;o daringly indi&s;|creet, that my father, without much ceremony, forbad him the hou&s;e: he thought &s;it to put up with this af|front, the better to facilitate his horrid purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>My un&s;u&s;pecting mother rejoiced that they had &s;o ea&s;ily got rid of a man, who&s;e unexpected vi&s;it had cau&s;ed her much unea&s;ine&s;s. From that time, how|ever,
<PB N="116" REF="018142_0113_0FA561E2143EE838">
a fatal alteration was vi&s;ible in my father's beha|viour; he became watchful and &s;u&s;picious:&mdash;no lon|ger did he return his lady's tender care&s;&s;es; no longer was he amu&s;ed with her innocent chearfulne&s;s. The mo&s;t artle&s;s of women, was now regarded as the mo&s;t artful. But how was his jealou&s;y increa&s;ed, when in|formed by one of his &s;pies, that Lord W&mdash;had ta|ken up his abode at a farm hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, and that he every night in di&s;gui&s;e was &s;een, either in the park or gardens.</P>
<P>This villain of a &s;py, as appears from the &s;equel, mu&s;t have been a creature of his lord&s;hip's, though my too credulous father believed him wholly devoted to his in|tere&s;t:&mdash;to be &s;hort, this deluded hu&s;band, one morn|ing, ro&s;e early, on pretence of going a hunting; he took leave of my mother, and &s;aid he &s;hould not be back till evening;&mdash;&s;he, as &s;oon as he was gone, again compo&s;ed her&s;elf to re&s;t. But ah! my dear Eliza, to what mi&s;ery did &s;he awake!&mdash;a noi&s;e &s;he heard at the door of her apartment made her &s;tart from her peaceful &s;lumber; it was bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed on the in&s;ide, a precaution &s;he had never thought of, but her enemies had done it for her, and &s;trongly did that circum&s;tance appear to confirm her guilt.

She cea&s;ed, and remained, with cla&s;ped hands, &s;treaming eyes, and di&s;hevelled hair, a &s;ilent moving &s;uppliant.

<P>A MOST &s;urpri&s;ing event has happened, my dear Melvill,&mdash;an event, which at fir&s;t threw me into a tran&s;port of joy,&mdash;but already does that begin to &s;ub&s;ide. I dare not indulge the delightful hope, that I &s;hall be freed from my unfortunate engagement:&mdash;and if I were, of what advantage would it be, &s;ince the amiable Harriot, for who&s;e &s;ake alone I wi&s;h to be re&s;tored to liberty,&mdash;&s;ince &s;he, that idol of my heart, is lo&s;t? O! that &s;he were now here,&mdash;but let me explain this my&s;tery.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday morning I was &s;itting in my library, which has, you know, a view of the road;&mdash;I was reading,&mdash;often have I recour&s;e to books,&mdash;but alas! how vain are precepts of philo&s;ophy? how ineffectual
<PB N="125" REF="018142_0122_0FA561ED2B50CE60">
to &s;ooth a grief like mine?&mdash;Seneca was in my hand,&mdash;but an unhappy pa&s;&s;ion wholly ingro&s;&s;ed both my head and heart; my eyes were fixed on the road,&mdash;I, in imagination, traced my Harriot in her flight,&mdash;every cariage that pa&s;&s;ed, &s;eemed to be conveying that dear &s;uffering angel from my &s;ight.</P>
<P>In this manner was I indulging my woe, when a chai&s;e, which drove at a furious rate, attracted my notice: there was nothing in this, which could rea&s;ona|bly excite in me the lea&s;t emotion;&mdash;and yet I found my&s;elf uncommonly agitated: it drew nearer, and at la&s;t entered my court-yard.&mdash;I &s;tarted up.&mdash;O! heaven, exclaimed I&mdash;can it be her? Not a moment was I &s;uffered to enjoy this improbable hope.&mdash;A young man, of genteel appearance, &s;prung from the carriage:&mdash;the arrival of this &s;tranger excited &s;ome cu|rio&s;ity,&mdash;I hurried to meet him;&mdash;he was at that in|&s;tant enquiring of the &s;ervants, in broken Engli&s;h, for Lady O&s;&s;ory.&mdash;They an&s;wered, agreeable to her orders, that &s;he was not at home.&mdash;I addre&s;&s;ed him in French;&mdash;there was &s;omething in his countenance, that, in &s;pite of the di&s;gu&s;t La Fare's treachery had ex|cited in me, for his countrymen, prejudiced me in his favor&mdash;He returned my civilities with great politene&s;s.&mdash;I led him into a parlour, for he &s;eemed exce&s;&s;ively fatigued:&mdash;When we were &s;eated, to my infinite &s;ur|pri&s;e, he &s;aid to me, You &s;ee before you, my Lord, one of the mo&s;t unfortunate of men,&mdash;a man, injured by you in the mo&s;t tender point. By me!&mdash;Yes, Sir&punc; but that injury was unintentional: we have both been the dupes of an artful woman; a woman, whom tho' I have rea&s;on to hate and de&s;pi&s;e, my ungovernable heart &s;till fondly doats on. In me, my Lord, behold the di&s;honored, the wretched hu&s;band of her, who has, for &s;ome months pa&s;t, a&s;&s;umed the title of Lady O&s;&s;ory;
<PB N="126" REF="018142_0123_0FA561EE0AE71B70">
a title to which &s;he can have no claim&mdash;&s;ince, long before &s;he &s;aw you, &s;he was mine by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties: but, preferring the &s;plendor of your rank to my humble &s;tation, &s;he forgot her vows,&mdash;deceived me with fal&s;e hopes, till &s;he returned to England,&mdash;then, &s;till more fatally deceived me, by &s;preading the report of her death. A friend of her's, wrote to my &s;i&s;ter on this &s;ubject, pretending that &s;he did &s;o, in compliance with her dying reque&s;t. Confined to my &s;tudies, and &s;trictly watched by an arbitrary father, I had no oppor|tunity of detecting this fal&s;hood. I was incon&s;olable for the &s;uppo&s;ed lo&s;s of a wife whom I adored:&mdash;&s;o vio|lent was my grief, that my life was de&s;paired of.&mdash;I was ordered to the Spa: there I, a few weeks ago, be|came acquainted with an Engli&s;h gentleman, who was al&s;o an acquaintance of your Lord&s;hip's;&mdash;you may gue&s;s the re&s;t. The &s;udden death of my father obliged me to defer my journey here for &s;ome time. I am now independent; can inconte&s;tibly prove my marriage, and have therefore a right to claim my wife: of you, my Lord, I claim her. I am well informed &s;he is in this hou&s;e, though your &s;ervants have denied her:&mdash;but from you, Sir, I expect ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I am only &s;orry, returned I, that this wife is &s;o little worthy of your affections:&mdash;but believe me, Sir, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to with hold her from you; on the contrary, I am ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> conduct you to her apartment: I imagine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is there, though I have not &s;een her for &s;ome days.

<P>I leave you, Melvill, to judge my tran&s;ports on this occa&s;ion, for I will not &s;well my narrative with reflec|tions
<PB N="127" REF="018142_0124_0FA561EEA6484718">
or comments: he followed me; but neither in her own apartment, nor in any other apartment in the hou&s;e, was the fallen angel to be found. My gentle|man began to &s;u&s;pect me of a de&s;ign to rob him of his right; and in con&s;equence of that thought, a&s;&s;umed an air, which in any other per&s;on, or on any other occa|&s;ion, I might have been tempted to re&s;ent; but I felt &s;o much compa&s;&s;ion for the poor enamoured, injured youth, that it left no room for any other &s;entiment. I conde&s;cended to expo&s;tulate, and dropped &s;ome hints of the treatment I had received from the woman he &s;o eagerly &s;ought;&mdash;hints, that one would have thought, might have damped his ardor; or at lea&s;t were &s;uffici|ent to have convinced him, that in&s;tead of wi&s;hing to with-hold her, I &s;hould rejoice to quit all right and title to her. My a&s;&s;urances, however, did not &s;atisfy him: I therefore called up my &s;ervants, every one of whom, in his pre&s;ence, underwent a &s;trict examination: they, one and all, denied any knowledge of her flight. As length, however, intimidated at my threats, or perhaps won by my promi&s;es of reward, one of her women con|fe&s;&s;ed, that the in&s;tant the &s;tranger arrived, her lady, who had &s;een him from her window, rang for her;&mdash;that &s;he found her almo&s;t fainting; but after taking a few drops, &s;he ha&s;tily cried, follow me, and bring that ca&s;ket with you. She then de&s;cended the back &s;tairs, and hurrying thro' the park, reached the neighbouring village,&mdash;when pulling out her pur&s;e, &s;he gave it to her attendant; charged her not to betray the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in her, nor on any terms to confe&s;s, that &s;he was witne&s;s to her flight; ordered her, as &s;oon as &s;he conveniently could, without being &s;u&s;pected, to hire a chai&s;e, and follow her to town with her cloaths; added, that &s;he would hear of her at Lady Bab Williams's: then procu|red a man and hor&s;e, mounted behind him, took the
<PB N="128" REF="018142_0125_0FA561F18DB5D3A0">
road to London, and was &s;oon out of &s;ight. This intel|ligence was &s;ufficient for the impetuous Frenchman; he &s;taid not to a&s;k any more que&s;tions, only wrote Lady Bab Williams, and the place of her re&s;idence in town, in his pocket-book, bowed to me and &s;prang into his car|riage, ordering the man to make all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>And now Melvill, what think you of this unex|pected adventure?&mdash;I dare not freely indulge my joy: they were both under age&mdash;no con&s;ent of pa|rents;&mdash;Sir Harry will &s;pare neither pains nor ex|pence to &s;et a&s;ide this fir&s;t marriage, and to e&s;tabli&s;h mine.&mdash;Faint, very faint are my hopes of a relea&s;e.&mdash;Her father acted mo&s;t di&s;honorably in concealing from me her elopement from the convent. The &s;tory is too long:&mdash;I am interrupted.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Melvill; call at Williams's; I make no doubt, but &s;he would fly to her friend Bab for &s;helter. I am exceedingly anxious to know what will be the i&s;&s;ue of this affair.</P>
<P>Your account of Mr Rivers, gave a deep impre&s;|&s;ion to my peace:&mdash;you, I &s;uppo&s;e, are intru&s;ted with the knowledge of his retreat. May that retreat afford him the tranquility, which he has in vain &s;ought for in the world;&mdash;Once more adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. Lord OSSORY to Mr. MELVILL.</HEAD>
<P>THE inclo&s;ed letters made me &s;hudder! What a &s;cene of horror do they di&s;clo&s;e!</P>
<P>In compa&s;&s;ion to the ill-fated Aubigny, I in&s;tantly &s;et off for Barnet, that I might, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ave him from the con&s;equences of his ra&s;hne&s;s.&mdash;I would not wi&s;h to &s;creen a criminal from ju&s;tice: But the circum|&s;tances of this melancholy affair, the provocation he had received, greatly extenuated his guilt, and rendered
<PB N="132" REF="018142_0129_0FA561F405289650">
him an object of pity. Alas! my pity came too late; ere I arrived he had fini&s;hed his part, the tragedy was at an end. I was led to the apartment: the fir&s;t ob|ject that &s;truck me, was the body of La Fare; be his crimes forgot, they ought not to outlive their puni&s;h|ment. I heard a deep &s;igh, and pa&s;&s;ed on to the bed,&mdash;there, in the la&s;t agonies of death, lay the wretched I&s;abella, the fair cau&s;e of all this mi&s;chief: &s;he was clo&s;e|ly pre&s;&s;ed in the arms of her unfortunate hu&s;band,&mdash;his eyes were clo&s;ed, and he was totally deprived of &s;en&s;e and motion;&mdash;yet, &s;o firmly did he cla&s;p her, that the nur&s;e, who wanted to rai&s;e her a little, could not di&s;engage her from him.&mdash;'Twas no matter, &s;he was too far gone, nothing could &s;ave her life.&mdash;I gue&s;&s;ed by the expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance, that &s;he knew me, but &s;he could not &s;peak;&mdash;all &s;he could do, was to turn her languid eyes towards Aubigny;&mdash;a tear dropp'd on his pale face;&mdash;&s;he then rai&s;ed them to me (now deprived of all their lu&s;tre) with a mournful &s;upplicating look, as if to &s;olicit my a&s;&s;i&s;tance for him: a deep groan followed that moving glance, which pier|ced my heart, and will never be effaced from my me|mory:&mdash;that glance was her la&s;t,&mdash;a &s;econd groan relea&s;ed her &s;truggling &s;oul from its narrow pri&s;on; and her once brilliant eyes were clo&s;ed forever.</P>
<P>Our whole attention was now engro&s;&s;ed by Au|bigny.&mdash;With great difficulty we unfa&s;tened his cla&s;p|ing hands, a &s;urgeon bled him, a few drops only i&s;&s;u|ed; but his pul&s;e cea&s;ed to beat, all remedies were fruitle&s;s;&mdash;he no longer &s;tood in need of our a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>What we had mi&s;taken for a &s;woon, was death:&mdash;grief and de&s;pair had broke his tender heart.&mdash;I have &s;een them decently, though very privately in|terred;&mdash;one grave contains the ill-fated pair.&mdash;La Fare,

out of re&s;pect to the memory of Aubigny. I ordered to be placed at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the church:&mdash;in death, at lea&s;t, his I&s;abella &s;hall be all his own.&mdash;Peace be to their a&s;hes&mdash;She who in life, out-&s;hone the faire&s;t of the fair;&mdash;&s;he who &s;o late, triumphant in her charms, her rank and riches now lies low, her du&s;t mixes with beggars, and not a &s;tone marks out her humble grave.</P>
<L>Favor is deceitful,</L>
<L>And beauty is vain:</L>
<L>A virtuous woman</L>
<L>Is a crown to her hu&s;band.</L>
<P>Adieu, my dear Melvill: the pro&s;pect of happine&s;s, which now opens to my view, would be too much for me to &s;upport, were it not for the melancholy &s;cenes in which I have been engaged.&mdash;I could wi&s;h how|ever, that my joy had received a more moderate alloy.&mdash;To-morrow morning I &s;hall proceed to London.&mdash;The rapturous &s;ubject neare&s;t my heart, I defer till meeting: I &s;hall then write to Mr. Rivers; he will, I hope, accompany us to the retreat of my love. I am now convinced that my Harriot and I were de&s;tined for each other. But ah! how fatal were the events, by which our union was to be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Why hangs this weight upon my heart?&mdash;'Tis true, I cannot yet call her mine,&mdash;but what now is there to prevent her being &s;o?&mdash;every ob&s;tacle is re|moved&mdash;O! I will not admit a doubt of my approach|ing felicity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. Mr. RIVERS to Mr. MELVILL.</HEAD>
<P>HOW is your unhappy friend, my dear Melvill? Has the exerci&s;e of travelling and change of &s;cenes, in any mea&s;ure produced the wi&s;hed effect? Is he yet recovered from that alarming &s;tupefaction, in which I &s;aw him depart&mdash;when he appeared a mere machine, moved at our plea&s;ure? Continue, mo&s;t va|luable and amiable young man, your generous care of him. There are few in&s;tances of a friend&s;hip like your's, and yet in Mr. Melvill it &s;eems nothing extraordinary. So much as the whole te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or of his life prepared us for noble and di&s;intere&s;ted actions. Never woman could boa&s;t the conque&s;t of two more exalted, more worthy

hearts, than my poor ill-fated Harriot. In this life we mu&s;t not hope for unmixed felicity. Had my love|ly girl been &s;pared, mine would have been perfect, and I &s;hould have de&s;cended to my grave in peace: &s;he alone is wanting to fill up the mea&s;ure of my hap|pine&s;s; but let me be thankful for the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings that are &s;till left me,&mdash;a wife, whom I have ever loved, at length re&s;tored to me&mdash;pure and un&s;ullied; all my injurious &s;u&s;picions removed; the &s;tronge&s;t, the mo&s;t convincing te&s;timonies of her inno|cence produced: that villain Lord W&mdash;, on his death-bed, confe&s;&s;ed to Mr. Stephens, who he purpo&s;e|ly &s;ent for, the accur&s;ed arts he had u&s;ed to excite my jealou&s;y; he expected a divorce would have followed, and that he &s;hould by that means become ma&s;ter of that amiable wife, of whom my ra&s;h credulity had ren|dered me &s;o unworthy. This be&s;t of women conde|&s;cends to be reconciled to me; &s;he has not uttered one &s;ingle reproach; with pious charity &s;he forgives my pa&s;t cruelty: &s;he is now, if po&s;&s;ible, more dear to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ond heart than when I fir&s;t received her to my arms, in all the blooming pride of youthful beauty. What a &s;alu|tary effect has her example, and the conver&s;ation of the worthy Stephens, produced in me? Long have I &s;tu|died philo&s;ophy, and from its &s;pecious precepts hoped for peace. Vain hope! Fruitle&s;s remedy for the ills of life; "their force alone religion can di&s;arm."</P>
<P>Here then I fix, and here only can I find a firm an|chor for my &s;oul.</P>
<P>My wife, who&s;e will &s;hall now be a law to me, is fond of this retreat. I have as little inclination as her to launch again into a tumultuous world: I have, therefore, in compliance with her reque&s;t, purcha&s;ed a commodious, plea&s;antly &s;ituated hou&s;e, which is not a
<PB N="138" REF="018142_0135_0FA561FDF0BC9000">
quarter of a mile from our pre&s;ent habitation. We cannot prevail on Mr. Stephens to live with us: no|thing, he &s;ays, could bribe him to quit his humble cot|tage, wherein he has pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many years of content|ment and tranquility. He will, however, be frequent|ly our welcome gue&s;t. A more youthful one, but one no le&s;s worthy, is come to con&s;ole, to wipe off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears of a di&s;con&s;olate mother, and to &s;upply to her the lo&s;s of a dear lamented daughter; the per&s;on I mean is the amiable Mi&s;s Dudley, the friend and confi|dant of my departed Harriot; &s;he is independent mi&s;|tre&s;s of a large fortune; is naturally of a grave turn; her gentle heart is formed for friend&s;hip, but &s;eems aver&s;e to attachments of a more tender nature: the late melancholy event has added to her pen&s;ive ca&s;t of mind.</P>
<P>She had let off to pay her Harriot a vi&s;it ere &s;he re|ceived your letter: long before would &s;he have given that proof of her regard, but that her friend refu&s;ed till our arrival here, to reveal to her the place of her re|treat. The moment &s;he was informed of it, &s;he &s;et off, and travelled po&s;t; greatly was &s;he fatigued;&mdash;when I handed her from her chai&s;e, &s;he was obliged to &s;up|port her&s;elf on my arm;&mdash;yet with all her friendly ha&s;te &s;he came too late to receive her Harriot's la&s;t adieu. She fainted on being told the fatal news;&mdash;when recovered, &s;he gave me her hand,&mdash;Lead me to her Sir,&mdash;bur&s;ting into a flood of tears &s;he exclaimed in broken accent,&mdash;Yes, Harriot! my &s;i&s;ter, my friend, I will clo&s;e thine eyes.&mdash;My child had ju&s;t been placed in her coffin;&mdash;the &s;erene &s;mile of innocence rendered her lovely even in death.&mdash;The moment we entered the room, Mi&s;s Dudley ha&s;tily quitted my arm, and ru&s;hed forward; &s;he wrung her hands in an agony of grief, while her &s;treaming eyes were fixed on her friend?&mdash;
<PB N="139" REF="018142_0136_0FA561FE6B6EFCF0">
at length, uttering a deep &s;igh, &s;he threw her arms round the coffin, and laid her cheek clo&s;e to her's;&mdash;&s;obs choaked the pa&s;&s;age of her voice; at la&s;t,&mdash;Not one tear only, my Harriot, rai&s;ing her head,&mdash;O, no! my eyes &s;hall never cea&s;e to flow!&mdash;in retirement will I bury my&s;elf, till thy grave receives me. You will not deny your Eliza a place by your &s;ide?&mdash;there will I join thee, my &s;weet companion,&mdash;my friend,&mdash;how benign is the air of that pale face!&mdash;&s;o have I &s;een thee look, when li&s;tening to a tale of woe;&mdash;the tears with which I have bedewed thee, &s;eem thine own.&mdash;Such were the gentle drops that pity has often cau&s;ed to flow;&mdash;but where is that dimpled &s;mile of innocent vivacity, with which you u&s;ed to enliven our little parties?&mdash;Alas! long, long has mirth been a &s;tranger to my Har|riot's brea&s;t,&mdash;and now it is for ever bani&s;hed from that of thy friend. Thy voice is &s;topped, my love; but I know what would have been thy la&s;t reque&s;t, Comfort my mother,&mdash;&s;upply my place. Yes, Harriot, that late-found amiable mother &s;hall be mine;&mdash;we will mix our tears, and talk of thee for ever. And now farewel, farewel my angel friend,&mdash;daily will I vi&s;it thy grave.&mdash;not a weed &s;hall be &s;uffered to grow near thee; thou withered ro&s;e, untimely cropped by the rude hand of death.
