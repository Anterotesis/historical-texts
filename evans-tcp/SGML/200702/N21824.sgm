<HEAD>THE CASTLE OF TRUTH, A MORAL TALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE beautiful Queen Altemira married Phanor, the mo&s;t amiable and hand|&s;ome of the Genii.&mdash;She was very importu|nate with the Genius to conduct her to his Ca&s;tle the evening they were married. Pha|nor &s;ighed, and looking tenderly on the Queen, replied, I for ever for&s;ake it on your account. It is not in my power to conduct you to my palace; but as you cannot live there, I for ever abandon it. Reign as &s;ove|reign of my heart, and your own faithful &s;ubjects: be &s;atisfied with that empire, and que&s;tion me no farther?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028733_0003_0FDBE7091D51A550">And &s;hall I never &s;ee your ca&s;tle, my Lord?</P>
<P>I really hope, &s;aid Phanor, the day will come when you may &s;ee it with &s;afety.</P>
<P>O! when! replied Altemira, keenly.</P>
<P>You may, in &s;ixteen years, if you are then anxious.</P>
<P>Sixteen years! O heavens!</P>
<P>Let me beg of you, both for your quiet and mine, to think no more of it till that time.</P>
<P>Altemira was very anxious, reflected, complained and wept, but Phanor would not yeild&mdash;They loved each other &s;in|cerely, and all the unhappine&s;s Altemira knew was a <HI>prudent hu&s;band;</HI> indeed had it not been for her perpetual que&s;tioning a|bout the Ca&s;tle, they would have lived very comfortably.</P>
<P>The Queen was happily delivered of a Prince&s;s, who was endowed with every qua|lification po&s;&s;ible, by her father the Genius, and named Zeolide. She was uncommon|ly lovely, and was &s;carcely fourteen years of age when her parents cho&s;e her a future hu&s;|band, who &s;hould be worthy of &s;o accom|pli&s;hed a Prince&s;s, the Prince Philamir, who adored her.&mdash;They con&s;ulted Zeolide, who
<PB N="5" REF="028733_0004_0FDBE70E5614FC10">
declared &s;he loved the Prince, above all who had ever &s;ought her.</P>
<P>The time was now at hand, when Alte|mira was to have her curo&s;ity indulged, to which &s;he looked forward with much impa|tience, and re&s;olved her daughter &s;hould not be married till her return from the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>They had been &s;ixteen years married, and &s;he entreated her hu&s;band to &s;et off imme|diately. &mdash;You &s;hall this evening hear my &s;to|ry, and if you then continue in the &s;ame mind, to-morrow you &s;hall be tran&s;ported thither. Altemira wi&s;hed her daughter to be pre&s;ent, and Phanor, though unwilling, con&s;ented, and being &s;at between the two Prince&s;&s;es in Altemira's apartment, he thus began.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF PHANOR THE GENIUS.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER &s;uperior to mortals our art may render us, it can make no im|pre&s;&s;ion on the heart; I was born with un|commonly &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and my father &s;aw, with regret, that I would never be di&s;|cre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> nor happy, without &s;ome centuries ex|perience.</P>
<P>Mean time I fell in love with a fairy called Prudina, who was highly e&s;teemed for her prudence, virtue and circum&s;pection; &s;he was by much my elder; and was valued more for her knowledge than beauty; this attach|ment
<PB N="8" REF="028733_0006_0FDBE713C083B6C0">
did me honour: &s;he di&s;covered it fir&s;t her&s;elf, and told me of it; I could not be|lieve it, and was preparing to deny it, when ob&s;erving &s;he &s;eemed certain, I thought it be&s;t to delay and examine my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Prudina then began to chide me for a pa&s;|&s;ion which &s;he termed childi&s;h and fooli&s;h, but did it with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, that &s;he only &s;hewed me by her lectures, there was a po&s;&s;ibility of gaining a place in her affec|tions; and thus the love &s;he anticipated be|came real. I declared my feelings, and my love was returned. Animated by this, I hinted marriage, which &s;he declined till &s;he had proved me; engaging at the &s;ame time not to tattle, and requiring a like promi&s;e of me; thus we loved and no-body knew.</P>
<P>As I one night was travelling through the Air to Prudina's Ca&s;tle, cries of a very pitia|ble &s;ort reached my ears, and made me &s;top; when looking around, I ob&s;erved a youth, &s;urrounded by his Slaves bearing torches, who &s;eemed racked with dreadful agonies; his attendants were numerous in carriages and on hor&s;eback; and they re-echoed his complainings, which heightened the terror of the &s;cene. I approached them, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to be made acquainted with
<PB N="9" REF="028733_0007_0FDBE71527C68690">
the cau&s;e of their di&s;tre&s;s. You behold, &s;aid the young man, the Prince Zimis, ce|lebrated for his love to the Prince&s;s Eliana; with whom I would have been married, had not Phormidas, that cruel Genius, become deeply enamoured of Eliana. She hated him, and he began to de&s;pair. Seizing this favourable opportunity, I &s;et out with my Prince&s;s and their attendants for my own kingdom to celebrate our nuptials.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we had entered a di&s;mal fore&s;t, Phormidas attacked us, and tore my charm|ing Eliana from my arms.</P>
<P>The&s;e three days pa&s;t I have been in vain endeavouring to trace the Ravi&s;her, and here I &s;top, overcome with fatigue and de|&s;pair, waiting the end of my unhappy days.</P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the mi&s;eries of this unhap|py Prince, I did all in my power to comfort him. I told him how much I was intere&s;t|ed in his di&s;tre&s;&s;es; that my power was &s;u|perior to that of Phormidas; I entreated him to retire to his own kingdom, where he &s;hould be again happy with Eliana before break of day. So &s;aying, I left Zimis and his Train, and ru&s;hed into the air, to &s;pend the night in avenging the oppre&s;&s;ed, which I had dedicated to love. I darted with a|amazing
<PB N="10" REF="028733_0008_0FDBE719DDECD3E0">
velocity to the Royal Palace of the king of the Genii, acquainted him with the melancholy &s;tory, and begged his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to re&s;tore Eliana to the arms of her lover.</P>
<P>Our Sovereign took me by the hand, and told me, he would give to me the honour of this adventure, and for that purpo&s;e would inform me of other particulars. Then lead|ing into a &s;uperb &s;aloon, ornamented with an infinitude of gla&s;&s;es, we mu&s;t enquire, &s;aid he, into her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, that we may adapt our a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the emergency of the ca&s;e: then touching one of the gla&s;&s;es with a golden wand, a Lady of perfect beauty appeared: notice, &s;aid he, in what &s;ituation &s;he is. Pre&s;ently the picture was completed, and I ob&s;erved Eliana in a garden alone, overcome with grief, &s;itting in a &s;wing, which at times reached almo&s;t to the clouds. Her condition di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me. The Genius &s;miled; then my&s;teriou&s;ly &s;haking his head, you will &s;ee what will afflict you more. He then gave me a Tali&s;man, by means of which I might tran&s;port my&s;elf into the pre&s;ence of Eliana whenever I plea&s;ed; but &s;aid he, be prudent, cool and courageous, and if you complete this perilous undertaking glori|ou&s;ly, you &s;hall name your own reward.
<PB N="11" REF="028733_0009_0FDBE71BE24FD040">
When he had &s;o &s;aid he left me with my Tali&s;man, and I in&s;tantly wi&s;hed my&s;elf with Eliana; immediately I was in a garden, heard voices, looked about, and by the light of the moon, which &s;hone uncommonly bright, I &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;tance the &s;ame Eliana I had &s;een in the gla&s;s; and what a&s;toni&s;hed me much, &s;he was in the very &s;ame po&s;ture, &s;winging with the utmo&s;t force.</P>
<P>A little &s;ylph who &s;tood by her thus addre&s;|&s;ed her. It does well enough to &s;wing a little now and then, but to be &s;winging, &s;winging, &s;winging con&s;tantly thus, is har&s;h, I think. How happy are you Zumio, replied the Prince&s;s, that can thus &s;upport your &s;pirits, you are al&s;o a &s;lave as well as me, but not treated with half the barbarity&mdash;Oh to what a ridiculous puni&s;hment am I condemned&mdash; Barbarous Genius&mdash;more barbarous Fairy &mdash;Here &s;he was obliged to &s;top, for now, her &s;winging was increa&s;ed to &s;uch a pitch, that &s;he could not fetch her breath.</P>
<P>I now under&s;tood, the unhappy Eliana was enchanted in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;wing. I approached her, proffered my &s;ervices, ac|quainted her with the &s;ituation of her lover, engaged to re&s;tore her to her freedom; and begged &s;he would freely communicate all
<PB N="12" REF="028733_0010_0FDBE72284E94748">
that had happened her. Alas! Alas! &s;aid &s;he, my Lord, Revenge and Jealou&s;y have invented an enchantment, which I fear you will not be able to break; &s;o cruel, &s;o di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing are the terms which mu&s;t fir&s;t be fulfilled.</P>
<P>My Story, continued &s;he, is &s;hortly this; having been &s;eparated from my hu&s;band, by the cruel Phormidas, I was in&s;tantly carried to his Ca&s;tle. I endeavoured to put an end to my wretched exi&s;tence, and would cer|tainly have done &s;omething fatal to my life had not the Ca&s;tle opened at the roof, and a Lady, or rather Fairy, made her appear|ance, riding in an ebony car drawn by four dreadful bats.&mdash;Phormidas was ju&s;t then pro&s;trate before me; but immediately ro&s;e in great confu&s;ion: The Furious Fairy, a&s;|&s;uming a mo&s;t imperious and terrible voice, &s;poke in the following manner:</P>
<P>And do you thus betray me, perfidious wretch? Do you thus, vile ingrate, prefer a mortal to <HI>Me,</HI> who, on thy account have for|&s;aken the mo&s;t hand&s;ome of all the Genii? But, you &s;hall not deceive me, and if you ex|pect forgivene&s;s, &s;urrender to me the Prin|ce&s;s, whom I will puni&s;h, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;erve her life. Keep in mind, if you

refu&s;e, that I am capable of much indeed to be <HI>revenged;</HI> I adore, while &s;he abhors thee.</P>
<P>The affrighted Genius, ki&s;&s;ed his chains, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively &s;urrendered me to the Fai|ry. She took me into her car, which a|&s;cending through the clouds in le&s;s than three minutes brought us here. I then pro&s;trated my&s;elf before her, intreated her compa&s;&s;ion, begged &s;he would re&s;tore me to Zimis, and u&s;ed every argument in my power to a&s;&s;wage her fury. She he&s;itated a little, then rai&s;ed me, with the&s;e words, I am not, prince&s;s, revengeful, but whim&s;ical; and if you will indulge me in a certain humour, which I have ju&s;t taken into my head, all that has pa&s;&s;ed will be forgiven. I have a &s;ingular predilection for &s;winging, &s;it down in this &s;wing&mdash;The thought appeared to me ridiculous, but &s;till it was an ea&s;y atonement, and I &s;at down very well plea&s;ed; but I was no &s;ooner &s;eated, than the Fairy, with a ter|rible voice, thus addre&s;&s;ed me:</P>
<P><HI>Swing here without cea&s;ing for thirty years, unle&s;s one of my lovers &s;hall within that time prove fickle without my knowing it.</HI></P>
<P>At that moment the Swing began to &s;wing &s;o violently that I in&s;tantly &s;wooned away; Zumio, the little &s;ylph you ju&s;t now &s;poke
<PB N="14" REF="028733_0012_0FDBE724EC421400">
with, run to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance and with trouble recovered me; at fir&s;t I gave up my&s;elf to de&s;pair, but I &s;oon became calm, when I re|flected, that from what &s;he &s;aid, it was evi|dent &s;he had lovers, and it would be &s;trange indeed, if none of them deceived her.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, replied Zumio, were it not for that valuable turquoi&s;e ring &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, which, &s;o &s;oon as any of her lovers cea&s;e to admire her, or are in any degree un|faithful, turns as yellow as gold. By day, the Fairy con&s;tantly wears this ring; and le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;tolen while &s;he &s;leeps, it is enclo&s;ed in a ca&s;ket of bra&s;s, every night, and is depo&s;ited in a grot dug in her garden, the gate of which is guarded by twelve terri|ble Crocodiles, &s;ix Ba&s;ili&s;ks and four Dra|gons, who emit large &s;tones of fire and &s;pue out &s;corching flames from their terrible jaws. If you then, my lord, continued Zumio, un|dertake the glorious enterprize, con&s;ider what dangers await you: but if you prove victorious, how glorious the atchievement? how important in its con&s;equences? when you are informed that all the&s;e &s;urrounding gardens are filled with beautiful prince&s;&s;es and ladies, who are here enchanted and con|demned to dreadful and tormenting puni&s;h|ments
<PB N="15" REF="028733_0013_0FDBE729A01610C8">
by the Jealous Fairy. For her barba|rity has not been confined to rivals only, but all who have given her umbrage have &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and &s;he is the enemy of all, who are remarkable for beauty, wit, virtue and other valuable accompli&s;hments. For my own part, I was once her mo&s;t admired page; I carried her mo&s;t private letters and billets-doux; unluckily I became the object of her &s;u&s;picion, and am now her pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Heavens! cried I, interrupting Zumio, what is her infamous name; tell me, O tell me, the name of &s;uch a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>Alas, my lord, replied Zumio, her hypo|cri&s;y is as remarkable as her wickedne&s;s. She is adored by the Genii, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mo&s;t virtuous of her tribe&mdash;How will you be a&s;toni&s;hed to hear&mdash;her name is&mdash; <HI>Prudina.</HI> Amazed, I left them precipitately, and by means of my Tali&s;man, was in&s;tant|ly at the gate of this well defended cavern. It would be tire&s;ome to you to repeat the ob|&s;tacles I &s;urmounted, &s;uffice it, that prompt|ed by every noble, every animating princi|ple, and incited by rage, malice and hatred, I overcame, and that only becau&s;e being a Genius I was immortal. The mon&s;ters I vanqui&s;hed; I tore down the gates and re|duced
<PB N="16" REF="028733_0014_0FDBE72BD347AB40">
them to powder; and then &s;natched the ca&s;ket, with its precious contents. The ring was a beautiful citron-colour; &s;o pla|cing it on my finger, I &s;wore it &s;hould never be removed.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant I had done &s;o, the garden re-echoed from a thou&s;and voices, the joyful ac|clamations of <HI>Liberty! Liberty! grateful thanks to Phanor! Freedom! Liberty!</HI></P>
<P>Immediately I left the Grotto, and found the garden filled with young and beautiful ladies, differently dre&s;t, who were running a|bout embracing and congratulating one ano|ther, while they repeated with loud voices, <HI>Thanks to the Genius Phanor! Liberty! Liber|ty!</HI> As the day began to break, I &s;oon di&s;|covered, leaning on the arm of the little Sylph, the incomparable Eliana. Ob&s;erving me, &s;he run towards me, exclaiming, &s;ee, &s;ee, our brave deliverer! immediately her companions followed her example, &s;ome madly ki&s;&s;ing me, &s;ome hugging me in their arms, &s;ome cla&s;ping my knees, and others &s;eizing me by the hands and arms. One more frantic than the re&s;t, leapt upon my back, and with a &s;hrill voice &s;ounded in my ear the words of Liberty, Liberty. This di&s;turbing exclamation, was continued &s;o
<PB N="17" REF="028733_0015_0FDBE72DA50802D0">
long and &s;o violently, that I was almo&s;t &s;tun|ned with the noi&s;e, when the Sovereign of the Genii him&s;elf approached, mounted on a white Elephant; he in&s;tantly ordered the noi&s;y company to be &s;ilent, and addre&s;&s;ed me thus. It belongs to you, Phanor, to give &s;entence on Prudina, as the Sole Ruler of her fate.</P>
<P>Her character, Gracious Sire, replied I, is unveiled; which is &s;ufficient Revenge, but I intreat in behalf of the&s;e her unfortunate victims, whom I recommend to your pity; command them to be tran&s;ported each to their native country, their friends, their Lo|vers, or where their hearts wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Immediately, the Genius rai&s;ed his &s;cep|tre and they all vani&s;hed; now &s;aid he, turn|ing to me, I engaged to perform whatever you wi&s;hed as a reward, and I will fulfil; but let me advi&s;e you to con&s;ider well, be|fore you determine, and when you have done &s;o, come to me.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;aid, he left me; I accord|ingly re&s;olved immediately to quit a place, which only furni&s;hed me with gloomy reflec|tions, when I accidently ob&s;erved the little &s;ylph, Zumio, conver&s;ing at the back of a tree, with one of the mo&s;t beautiful women
<PB N="18" REF="028733_0016_0FDBE731D4CB3248">
I had ever &s;een. I was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed; when he came up to me and told me, he was determined to cleave to me at all haz|ards, and therefore had not left the Garden. This beautiful Lady, &s;aid he, will tell you her own hi&s;tory, if you incline. Undoubt|edly, replied I.</P>
<P>She &s;miled a&s;&s;ent; and &s;itting down by her, I entreated her to communicate freely, what had determined her to remain there.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid &s;he, the other Ladies have all Lovers or hu&s;bands; I neither. Their fidelity, I approve, but cannot follow. But as you wi&s;h to hear an account of my ad|ventures, I &s;hall certainly attempt it.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF AGELIA.</HEAD>
<P>MY heart is uncommonly tender, and my imagination lively; I have a great &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility and delicacy, &s;o I am ea&s;ily captivated, but hard to fix. When I am fir&s;t enraptured, I view every thing in the favourable way, and not only adore my
<PB N="19" REF="028733_0017_0FDBE733202CBD78">
lover, but deify him; when accident or pe|culiar circum&s;tances expo&s;e the reality, I find I have been carried away by delu&s;ion; and appear as one ari&s;ing from a plea&s;ant dream, which vani&s;heth, leaving nothing &s;o|lid. This effort of rea&s;on mankind call in|con&s;tancy, yet with me it is the effect of deception, not &s;atiety or whim.</P>
<P>It was my misfortune, about two years &s;ince, to become the rival of Prudina; I had been for three months the favourite of a youth, to whom &s;he took a fancy; this end|ed in my confinement; I was tran&s;ported hither, and while &s;he led me by the hand acro&s;s the garden, I gave place to the keen|e&s;t angui&s;h. Agelia, &s;aid &s;he, be not &s;o ter|rified, I will not be har&s;h; your appear|ance plea&s;es, and were it not for that air of incon&s;tancy, and ficklene&s;s, you would de|light me: I will therefore make it more my &s;tudy to amend than cha&s;ti&s;e you, for you have intere&s;ted me much in your behalf. I was not however impo&s;ed on by her preten|ces. We walked on, from garden to bow|er, and from bower to grove, till at length not a tree was to be &s;een; we were in a wide extended plain, bounded by the &s;urround|ing horizon. The pro&s;pect was &s;omething
<PB N="20" REF="028733_0018_0FDBE7356024B6C8">
like a &s;ea &s;cene, were it not, that the noi&s;e of the waves, the motion of the &s;hip, and the reflection of the &s;un beams on the water, animate this picture; while where we were, there was nothing to relieve the mind under the a&s;toni&s;hing uniformity of the plain round us. No &s;hrub, flower, nor herb was to be &s;een, but a beautiful &s;hort gra&s;s, all of one &s;pecies. An univer&s;al calm and profound &s;ilence reigned throughout this va&s;t &s;olitude; and not an in&s;ect or bird was to be &s;een, nay not a cloud to vary ever &s;o little the uniform bluene&s;s of the &s;ky. At fir&s;t this view rather produced an agreeable feeling; I was tran&s;ported with admiration and rap|ture. It delights me, &s;aid Prudina, to per|ceive the &s;cene plea&s;es you; it is calculated to &s;often the vigorous &s;allies of your imagi|nation, though time and reflection will be nece&s;&s;ary to complete it, I therefore propo&s;e that you &s;hould remain here, where no va|riation will di&s;turb you; the &s;ky will be al|ways &s;erene, never cloudy, no alteration of day and night, no inclemency of &s;ea&s;ons, perpetual day will ever charm you.</P>
<P>When &s;he had thus &s;poken, &s;he ordained me to walk with a &s;tately noble &s;tep, around this lawn, for thirty years, unle&s;s, &s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="21" REF="028733_0019_0FDBE7805BF42890">
one of my lovers &s;hall within that time prove fickle without my knowing it. Having thus &s;aid, &s;he vani&s;hed: and I found my&s;elf com|pelled to walk at a &s;low &s;teady pace, not having it in my power to turn to the one hand or the other, of &s;topping or &s;itting down to re&s;t.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the idea of this con&s;tant walk at the &s;ame pace I found very di&s;agreeable, but I did not then know the extent of my puni&s;hment. I beheld the inconceivably rich and exten&s;ive carpet, &s;urrounded by a clear and plea&s;ant horizon, with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">pture. Can it be, &s;aid I, that gra&s;s and &s;ky, green and blue, can furni&s;h &s;o remarkable and &s;triking a pro&s;pect! Thus it is that the &s;ub|lime is formed by grandeur and &s;implicity.</P>
<P>The fre&s;h idea of my lover, the expecta|tion that the fairy might be impo&s;ed upon without her knowledge, and &s;uch like phi|lo&s;ophic raptures as the the above, &s;olaced me for a few hours. But this rapture &s;oon cooled, di&s;gu&s;t took place of exta&s;ies, the boundle&s;s extent of never cea&s;ing verdure, which ravi&s;hed me &s;o much, &s;oon became tire&s;ome, loath&s;ome and in&s;ipid; no variety, nothing to attract my attention, the recollec|tion of unfortunate love was all the object of
<PB N="22" REF="028733_0020_0FDBE7395D2E5258">
my thoughts; and even this by degrees was effaced.</P>
<P>Fatigued fancy &s;oon lo&s;t all its &s;trength, my wandering ideas became undetermined; my fanciful hopes for&s;ook me; even my pa&s;|&s;ion it&s;elf took the flight, and thus was I a|lone in this almo&s;t incomprehen&s;ible expan&s;e. When a dangerous mi&s;take is rectified by rea&s;on, to &s;ubdue it brings comfort and we are happy. But however noble and prai&s;e-worthy it may be to &s;ubdue our pa&s;&s;ions, there is &s;omething truly di&s;heartening in them quitting us; the imagination is in &s;ome degree annihilated, and the heart faded. Pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t either be conquered by rea&s;on or vanqui&s;hed by time.</P>
<P>Thus painfully &s;ituated I traver&s;ed my end|le&s;s road. My tears for&s;ook me, I had not even &s;trength enough of mind to be afflict|ed, but I became di&s;pirited, &s;o gaping about I gave place to unbearable wearine&s;s; the only real object of de&s;ire which I felt in my mind was once more to have a pro&s;pect of animated nature; a &s;hrub, a hill or a dwel|ling would have ravi&s;hed me; thundering, rain, &s;torms, wind, nay a cloud, would have afforded an agreeable &s;en&s;ation. The very ab&s;ence of night, the moon and &s;tars, were
<PB N="23" REF="028733_0021_0FDBE7858F225420">
grating to me; in &s;hort, any change of any &s;ort was at this time my idea of happine&s;s. Now it was that I experienced that Prudina could not have taken a more effectual me|thod to puni&s;h my levity and incon&s;tancy, than this ingenious device.</P>
<P>You will therefore ea&s;ily conceive, my lord, that &s;ummit of joy to which I was rai&s;ed, when I, thanks to your valour, found my|&s;elf enabled to walk fa&s;t or &s;low, to &s;it down or ri&s;e up, and in the mid&s;t of this garden. My lover has &s;urely now forgotten me, by eighteen months ab&s;ence; and if he has not, how can I po&s;&s;ibly endure his never cea&s;ing complaints; all countries and climes are therefore equal to me, for I wi&s;h not to return to my own: and I care not where I &s;pend my days if I am not doomed to va&s;t plains or boundle&s;s lawns.</P>

<P>Agelia having thus fini&s;hed her hi&s;tory, I aro&s;e, and with my wand, de&s;cribing a cir|cle in the air, transformed the palace and gardens of the fairy, into a &s;uperb palace, &s;ituated on the top of a hill, and found our|&s;elves &s;tanding on the terrace, which com|manded a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect. The view of rocks, water-falls, precipices, vil|lages, flocks and herds, and the &s;ea, quite
<PB N="24" REF="028733_0022_0FDBE73AA689B900">
tran&s;ported the happy Agelia; for all the plea&s;ing and maje&s;tic objects of nature were united, but no plains. There, &s;aid I to A|gelia, you are Queen; and if you wi&s;h me gone, &s;peak the word, and however great the &s;acrifice, you &s;hall be obeyed; for my happine&s;s is to &s;ee you &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Her reply at fir&s;t was tender and perplex|ed; but &s;he &s;oon re&s;umed her accu&s;tomed ga|iety and was uncommonly plea&s;ant through|out the day: towards night, &s;he fell into a kind of languid melancholy, which added to her charms, and made her &s;o beautiful that I lo&s;t my heart irrecoverably.</P>
<P>I conducted her to the terrace after &s;up|per, where the pro&s;pect of the &s;tar-bediz|zened &s;ky amazed her; &s;he trembled, and gaped up in rapture. Oh, cried &s;he, what an amazing &s;pectacle!</P>
<P>Falling at her knees, I ventured to con|fe&s;s my admiration and love. She heard me attentively, and was affected, &s;he wept, I pre&s;&s;ed her for an an&s;wer. Having pau&s;ed a little and wiped off her tears, Phanor, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;en&s;ibly feel your kindne&s;s, and your tender behaviour, but give me time to look into mine own heart, and to know more of yours. And then left me.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="028733_0023_0FDBE786C5F40470">I in&s;tantly examined my turquoi&s;e ring, and to my great joy found that &s;he loved me. The day following I pre&s;&s;ed &s;till more urgent|ly for an an&s;wer. I dread, &s;ays &s;he, le&s;t I &s;hould impo&s;e both on you and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fear not, my beauteous Agelia, &s;aid I in a rapture, and pro&s;trating my&s;elf before her, I know I am beloved; I cannot doubt my happine&s;s&mdash;at the&s;e words I cea&s;ed, per|ceiving in Agelia's looks, that &s;he con&s;ider|ed my certainty as pre&s;umptuous; and in truth, it had a vain appearance. She ap|peared re&s;erved, and treated me &s;omewhat di&s;dainfully. I found it nece&s;&s;ary to be more prudent, and a&s;&s;umed a tone of de&s;pair. A|gelia &s;oftened, and in a little time acknow|ledged I had gained her heart; the day, the happy day was fixed, when two hearts &s;o &s;ud|denly cemented by love were to be &s;till more clo&s;ely united at the altar of Hymen.</P>
<P>I was walking on the terrace with Agelia on the evening preceding the wi&s;hed-for day; &s;he fixed her eyes on the ocean which wa&s;h|ed the palace walls. I had remarked that for two days pa&s;t &s;he had appeared more ab&s;ent and much le&s;s enraptured than formerly, yet my ring retained its u&s;ual colour, and her appearance of con&s;equence di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me the
<PB N="26" REF="028733_0024_0FDBE740094E56E8">
le&s;s. Pau&s;ing a little, &s;he turns to me. Can|not you, &s;aid &s;he, with whom almo&s;t every thing is po&s;&s;ible, make the&s;e rocks and moun|tains di&s;appear; for the pro&s;pect is quite over|loaded, and the eye has no relief; you have too much water; tho&s;e dreadful rocks terrify the mind, and it is painful to hear the roar|ings of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>And have the&s;e Land&s;capes, in which you &s;o much delighted formerly, wearied you, my Agelia, &s;aid I; &s;ince that is your will then, they al&s;o &s;hall di&s;appear, however highly I value them, and they are dear to me indeed, &s;ince it was here, you fir&s;t promi&s;ed to be mine.</P>
<P>She made me no an&s;wer, but gave me her hand with a look of mildne&s;s and love: I ki&s;&s;ed it with rapture. She at this moment, ca&s;t her eye upon my ring, and with a &s;eem|ingly carele&s;s air, pulled it off my finger. This rather &s;tartled me, however, fearful to rai&s;e her &s;u&s;picion, I &s;uffered her to examine it more clo&s;ely.</P>
<P>This ring is of a beautiful colour, &s;aid &s;he, but I hate turquoi&s;e; Oh fie! it is badly mounted; I di&s;like it much; and with the&s;e words, &s;he rai&s;ed her arm and ca&s;t it into the &s;ea, without allowing me time to &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="27" REF="028733_0025_0FDBE78BC8CB7ED0">
her intention, much le&s;s to pre&s;erve what I con&s;idered as a mo&s;t valuable trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I &s;tood fixed with &s;urpri&s;e; and Agelia looked at me with a certain &s;ort of mi&s;chiev|ous delight which provoked me;&mdash;I re|&s;trained my&s;elf a little, but &s;oon gave vent to every reproach which could be incited by the mo&s;t violent rage and pa&s;&s;ion. She looked at me with great compo&s;ure. Having heard me to an end, I acknowledge &s;aid &s;he, the &s;e|cret qualities of your ring I have been in|formed of. A &s;u&s;picion of it has hung about me &s;ome days, and Zumio &s;atisfied me. In|famous Zumio, I exclaimed!</P>
<P>I made him believe I was in the &s;ecret, and led him on to betray you; he has been prudent enough; but like many others out|witted by a woman; for human wi&s;dom, pe|netration, nor philo&s;ophy have not yet di&s;co|vered an antidote for female powers, and this, even Genii them&s;elves have experien|ced. But, my Lord, if your di&s;tre&s;s at lo&s;|ing this turquoi&s;e is on my account, it is vain, for I am not in the lea&s;t degree di&s;po&s;ed to deceive you.</P>
<P>But why, cruel woman, have you depriv|ed me of this valuable ring; which would
<PB N="28" REF="028733_0026_0FDBE74169E4DA80">
have prevented all doubts, and rendered pro|te&s;tations u&s;ele&s;s?</P>
<P>But, my lord, I delight in talking, now the ring left me nothing to chatter a|bout; and you your&s;elf mu&s;t acknowledge that &s;uch a bond, was not paying me a com|pliment. How generous, noble and deli|cate would it have been, after I had been pouring out my love-&s;ick effu&s;ions into your bo&s;om, for you to &s;neak into a corner and demand confirmation from your ring? You &s;ay you love me; I believe you, without a ring. I will explain love to you. When|ever I confe&s;&s;ed my love to you, you &s;hould have taken this villainous Tali&s;man, this high-prized trea&s;ure, and ca&s;t it for ever from you, &s;aying, <HI>This is now u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince I am &s;o well a&s;&s;ured of her love.</HI></P>
<P>I heard her out with amazement; then falling on my knees, I entreated her for|bearance and pardon.</P>
<P>Forbearance! exclaimed &s;he, you are in|&s;en&s;ible of its worth; the injuries you have ju&s;t mentioned, did I not forgive? and when I ca&s;t your ring into the &s;ea, could you not recollect, that it had not changed its colour; but your rage, that unworthy pa&s;&s;ion you ju&s;t now vented&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="028733_0027_0FDBE78DEF01F750">O my Agelia, have patience, you har|row up my &s;oul. You cannot now, my lord, dive into my heart as before, but I will not even now deceive you; my word is far more to be depended on than any ring &mdash;Hear me then, and believe me&mdash;<HI>I love you not, nor ever &s;hall.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e words &s;he pronounced &s;o &s;teadily and coolly, that they left me no room to que&s;tion their reality. My love for her was of the mo&s;t fervent kind; this misfortune I could not &s;upport, I gave place to de&s;pair. Falling at her feet, I bedewed them with my tears, and be&s;ought her, to leave me only a gleam of hope.</P>
<P>Let this teach you, &s;aid &s;he, the value of your ring, you cannot bear the truth, and therefore intreat me to deceive you&mdash;It is very proper to endeavor to remove fanta&s;ies which di&s;turb or di&s;tre&s;s us, but why &s;hould we tho&s;e that amu&s;e and comfort us? Take an advice from me, my lord; and by all means be on your guard in future, never to apply your attention in con&s;tructing a Tali&s;|man like that from which I have relieved you; for when you do, depend upon it, you are but con&s;tructing fre&s;h torments. Be on your guard again&s;t men, and be jealous
<PB N="30" REF="028733_0028_0FDBE742F599AA18">
of them, but never let your friend or mi&s;|tre&s;s be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Her advice was a good one, but as my misfortunes were not yet at an end, I di&s;re|garded it. Nothing would have effect on Agelia, &s;he continued unmoved; and I found it nece&s;&s;ary to leave her, overwhelm|ed with de&s;pair, and &s;pent &s;ome months at a di&s;tance from her, where I gave full vent to my grief. I was attended here, by Zumio, who was &s;o much attached to me, &s;o chear|ful and gentle, that I forgot he was the un|de&s;igned &s;ource of my mi&s;ery, and made him my con&s;tant companion; be&s;ides I could talk to him of Agelia.</P>
<P>Zumio entertained me from time to time with accounts of his travels, for he had &s;een much of the world, and told his &s;tory grace|fully. Among other things he frequently talked to me of a Prince&s;s, he named Arpa|li&s;a, of whom he &s;aid &s;o many fine things, that he rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity about her&mdash;Is &s;he as hand&s;ome as Agelia, &s;aid I?</P>
<P>As hand&s;ome as Agelia! replied Zumio, in deri&s;ion; You had never fallen in love with her, had you &s;een Arpali&s;a; Agelia is plea&s;ant and agreeable enough, with a little da&s;h of wit at times; but at be&s;t &s;he is whim|&s;ical
<PB N="31" REF="028733_0029_0FDBE78F5E847C18">
to an extreme, wild and uncommonly thoughtle&s;s; it is fooli&s;h to compare her with Arpali&s;a, who is a mo&s;t complete mo|del of perfection; her beauty dazzling; the depth of her under&s;tanding a&s;toni&s;hing; her accompli&s;hments, virtues, greatne&s;s of &s;oul, &s;en&s;ibility and extent of knowledge would enchant you&mdash;Oh, did you hear her di&s;cour&s;e on friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>There was no &s;topping of Zumio, when he began to talk of Arpali&s;a; till at length the daily hearing &s;o much of her, gave a great inclination to &s;ee this wonderful Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all Agelia had &s;aid, I could not help regretting the want of the ring: I had &s;till my reward to a&s;k from the &s;overeign of the Genii; &s;o after much uncertainty and many re&s;olutions I at length went to him, and a&s;ked him to con&s;truct me a ca&s;tle, into which whoever entered, &s;hould be compel|led by a &s;ecret charm, to &s;peak whatever were their &s;ecret thoughts; while, I my&s;elf only, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the ca&s;tle, &s;hould have an exemption from the general law: for, Di&s;cretion, &s;aid I, is nece&s;&s;ary for a lover, and I would not wi&s;h to expo&s;e my&s;elf to act improperly. I be&s;ought the &s;overeign, that in the Ca&s;tle, I might hear the language of
<PB N="32" REF="028733_0030_0FDBE7446CF70C20">
&s;incerity; &s;ee things as they really are: and tho&s;e who &s;peak &s;hould &s;peak their real thoughts; I intreated, that tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to deceive, might not be &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ay|ing the very contrary of their meaning; that they &s;hould not hear them&s;elves, but &s;up|po&s;e they really expre&s;&s;ed that flattery with which they meant to impo&s;e on others&mdash;This double charm was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, other|wi&s;e many would keep &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Ra&s;h thoughtle&s;s Phanor, replied the Ge|nius, what an imprudent reque&s;t?&mdash;My oath is however &s;acred; therefore go to your own place, and in place of the hou&s;e you have for|merly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that which you have de&s;ired will be in its room. I have here a box for you, which will pre&s;erve you from its dangerous laws; pre&s;erve it, and you will &s;peak only what you wi&s;h; or any per&s;on in who&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion it may be; but be careful to pre&s;erve it, as I cannot make another of the kind. I took the box from the monarch of the Ge|nii, and departed with many expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude.</P>
<P>I now found a Ca&s;tle, in the &s;pot where the former &s;tood, the dazzling appearance of which charmed me: It was built of a com|po&s;ition which had all the &s;plendor, &s;trength
<PB N="33" REF="028733_0031_0FDBE793D57DADB0">
and tran&s;parency of the mo&s;t re&s;plendent Dia|mond; the workman&s;hip noble, yet light; and ornamented with various precious &s;tones; on the Golden Doors, was the following in|&s;cription, '<HI>The Ca&s;tle of Truth.</HI>'</P>
<P>I touched the gates with my wand, as I en|tered, pronounced the&s;e words, <HI>who&s;oever en|ters the gates of this Ca&s;tle mu&s;t remain three months; and I &s;wear by my Art, that unalter|able oath, I never will cancel this law.</HI> Then opening the gates I commanded free acce&s;s to all who inclined.</P>
<P>I &s;oon experienced the danger attend|ing a <HI>Ca&s;tle of Truth.</HI> My &s;laves and atten|dants now an&s;wered me with the utmo&s;t can|dour and hone&s;ty, every que&s;tion I a&s;ked them; and very &s;oon &s;o provoked my rage, that I &s;peedily clo&s;ed the doors on them all; and indeed, their fidelity and attachment have never been replaced to me. I even be|gan to be di&s;plea&s;ed with Zumio; I &s;aw into his real character, and found he was both de|ficient in di&s;cernment and under&s;tanding; that multiplicity of unmeaning words to which he gave free &s;cope di&s;gu&s;ted me, and I was a&s;toni&s;hed they had ever entertained me. I found a great many faults in him, I did not know of before; he was very ob&s;ti|nate,
<PB N="34" REF="028733_0032_0FDBE74C4335BF30">
contradicted me at every word; in &s;hort, I was di&s;gu&s;ted with his want of polite|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>As he &s;till &s;aid, however, he had a friend|&s;hip for me, I did not come to an ab&s;olute rupture with him; but I &s;colded or &s;napped at him continually, and he in&s;olently replied my pride was in&s;upportable. I commanded him to be &s;ilent; he would &s;hrug his &s;houl|ders, mock me, alternately &s;hew anger or vexation, and thus we pa&s;&s;ed our time, either &s;ullenly, or wrangling with each other.</P>
<P>Quite tired of his tete-a-tete, I continually hoped &s;ome travellers, invited by the brilliant a&s;pect of my Palace, would wi&s;h to enter; but pa&s;&s;engers contented them&s;elves with ad|miring it; they approached it eagerly, but as &s;oon as they read the in&s;cription, as eager|ly left it, and pur&s;ued their way.</P>
<P>One day as I &s;tood with Zumio, on a balcony, we &s;aw a magnificent Chariot at a di&s;tance, driving towards the Palace. I knew by my Art this Chariot belonged to a King, accompanied with &s;even or eight Courtiers. As it approached, Zumio &s;aid, at la&s;t I hope we &s;hall have a vi&s;itor, for which I &s;hall be very glad, for I have been mo&s;t dread|fully dull ever &s;ince I have been here.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="028733_0033_0FDBE7949E6E92B8">As Zumio &s;poke, the Chariot advanced to the gates; the King read the in&s;cription, and his fir&s;t movement was to enter; but the courtiers grew pale, &s;huddered, and de|tained him. The King per&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time; at la&s;t he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be per|&s;uaded, and withdrew; the Courtiers once more recovered their breath, turned the Chariot precipitately away, and &s;oon were out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>So they are gone, cried Zumio, with chagrin; but while you will per&s;i&s;t to leave that cur&s;ed in&s;cription over the gate, we &s;hall never &s;ee a &s;oul. You are &s;o wilful! &mdash;I really never met with a Genius &s;o ob|&s;tinate and &s;tupid.</P>
<P>Your in&s;olence is beyond all bounds, Zumio.</P>
<P>Oh! what you want truth and compli|ments both at once; your folly is really in|comprehen&s;ible, and at &s;ome moments you are as incon&s;i&s;tent and fooli&s;h as you are proud.</P>
<P>Shocked at his exce&s;&s;ive impertinence, I was going to drive him from me, when I perceived a figure that fixed my whole at|tention. A venerable old man, with a ma|je&s;tic pre&s;ence that in&s;pired re&s;pect, and a
<PB N="36" REF="028733_0034_0FDBE74D6450A950">
mild placidity in his countenance, which in|tere&s;ted the heart in &s;pite of it&s;elf, approach|ed with a book in his hand, reading, and walking &s;lowly.</P>
<P>When he came oppo&s;ite the Ca&s;tle gates, he lifted up his eyes, and read the in&s;crip|tion. Oh, thou, &s;aid he, whom for the&s;e forty years I have &s;ought! O! cele&s;tial Truth, am I then in my latter days permit|ted to &s;ee thee unclouded, and as thou art?</P>
<P>So &s;aying, the old man entered the Pa|lace.</P>
<P>So here is one at la&s;t, &s;aid Zumio, and in&s;tantly left me to go and meet the &s;tran|ger. I followed my little hair-brained Sylph, and we &s;oon met the old man. Zumio flew; come in, come good man, &s;aid he, you are very welcome, e&s;pecially if you can rid us of our horrid dulne&s;s. You are old, have been in various &s;cenes of life, and can tell us a good many &s;tories; but fir&s;t, pray what is your name?</P>
<P>Gelanor, replied the old man; in my youth I lived among men; I have been a great traveller, and for the&s;e la&s;t twenty years have devoted my days to &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Ah! I perceive, interrupted Zumio, you are a Philo&s;opher; we &s;hall not be much
<PB N="37" REF="028733_0035_0FDBE796FA961F88">
the merrier for you.&mdash;Nor will you find much entertainment here, for Philo&s;ophers are curious; you, no doubt, imagine you may &s;tudy mankind in this place, but that is your mi&s;take; you will find no body here but this Genius, my Ma&s;ter, and me: he, as you perceive, is not very communica|tive; be&s;ides, there is nothing original in his character. As for me, it is true, I have a deal of wit, many virtues and accompli&s;h|ments, and it will take you &s;ome time to know me.</P>
<P>I know you better at pre&s;ent, replied Ge|lanor, &s;miling, than you &s;eem to know your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I now &s;poke in turn, and a&s;ked him what was his opinion of him&s;elf?</P>
<P>I am good, &s;aid he, but imperfect; yet cannot conceive, after having led a life of reflection, and of endeavours to know my own heart, how I can &s;till have &s;o many de|fects and foibles. This idea, however, is &s;o often pre&s;ent to my mind, that it pre|&s;erves me from pride, and makes me indul|gent. My public and private actions are irreproachable; but I often experience in|terior &s;en&s;ations which are humiliating; and were I to render an exact and circum&s;tantial
<PB N="38" REF="028733_0036_0FDBE752B53AC138">
account of all the ideas which pre&s;ent them|&s;elves to my imagination, I am afraid I &s;hould not be found much wi&s;er than others.</P>
<P>When he had &s;aid thus, I approached Ge|lanor, and embraced him with mo&s;t re&s;pect|ful affection. Oh, my father! &s;aid I, I can|not expre&s;s my admiration; you are a true philo&s;opher, and I &s;hall ever honour, &s;hall eternally re&s;pect all tho&s;e who re&s;emble you.</P>
<P>Some days after this conver&s;ation, I deter|mined to obliterate the in&s;cription from the gates of my Palace. I then quitted Gelanor and Zumio, and, without telling them my project, guided by that curio&s;ity which Zu|mio had in&s;pired, departed for the kingdom of the Prince&s;s Arpali&s;a. Fearing Zumio's indi&s;cretion, I would neither take him with me, nor impart my de&s;ign.</P>
<P>I &s;oon came to this celebrated Prince&s;s, who would not receive me till evening, and I was then introduced into a &s;uperb &s;aloon, lighted in a mo&s;t agreeable manner, the wax lights were all within cry&s;tal, covered with white gauze, or &s;et in va&s;es of alaba&s;ter; which artifice produced a &s;oftne&s;s, &s;ome|what like clear moon-light. The Prince&s;s was &s;eated on a Throne of gold, over which was a pavilion, decorated with drapery of
<PB N="39" REF="028733_0037_0FDBE7986716C278">
&s;ilver gauze; garlands of ro&s;es formed ele|gant fe&s;toons, and crowns were &s;u&s;pended over her head.</P>
<P>Arpali&s;a was clothed in magnificent robes, garni&s;hed with precious &s;tones. Her appear|ance was dazzling, and her beauty &s;eemed to me regular and maje&s;tic; though the was not very young, I admired her &s;hape; her noble air, the &s;urpri&s;ing fairne&s;s of her com|plexion, and was charmed with her conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>The next day my admiration was more increa&s;ed, when, by the orders of the Prin|ce&s;s, I was conducted into a gallery full of paintings, and informed they were all the performances of Arpali&s;a; they were on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubjects; Temples to Friend&s;hip, &s;acrifices to Friend&s;hip, Friend|&s;hip triumphing over love: Time crowning and embeli&s;hing friend&s;hip: or Altars to Benevolence, Benevolence enlightened by Virtue, Compa&s;&s;ion exciting Benevolence, &amp;c. &amp;c. In fine, it was not po&s;&s;ible to leave this gallery, without a full per&s;ua&s;ion that Arpali&s;a was the mo&s;t gentle and virtuous Prince&s;s in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>From thence I was led to the Laboratory, and, returning, my Conductor told me, in
<PB N="40" REF="028733_0038_0FDBE75428E1F140">
confidence, that the Prince&s;s employed her time, with equal advantage, in A&s;tronomy and Mathematics. As I had a particular love for tho&s;e &s;ciences, I was enchanted at the di&s;covery: though the high opinion I had before conceived of the Prince&s;s was al|mo&s;t incapable of increa&s;e.</P>
<P>There was a Concert in the evening, and a Symphony of Arpali&s;a's compo&s;ition was performed. The Prince&s;s then &s;at down to the harp&s;ichord, and &s;ang; her voice did not appear very remarkable, but, in fact, it was almo&s;t entirely drowned by the ac|companyments; but an excellent mu&s;ician who &s;at by my &s;ide, a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he &s;ung in a &s;uperior &s;tyle; and I found he had rea&s;on to &s;ay &s;o, for every body was in raptures.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, they made extempore Poe|try and Enigmas, which gave the Prince&s;s an opportunity of &s;hewing her wit. I could not recover from my amazement; what I heard was incredible, and I found it would not be po&s;&s;ible long to pre&s;erve my liberty in the pre&s;ence of &s;o accompli&s;hed a Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Every body retired at midnight, and I remained alone with Arpali&s;a, and her bo|&s;om friend Telira. The two friends were re|clined on a couch, and tenderly folded in
<PB N="41" REF="028733_0039_0FDBE79F042C2550">
each other's arms; the picture was delight|ful; I contemplated it in &s;ilence, and li&s;ten|ed while they &s;aid every thing the &s;ublime&s;t friend&s;hip could dictate. Arpali&s;a gave me &s;o lively, and &s;o affecting an impre&s;&s;ion of her love for Telira, that I was moved even to tears.</P>
<P>I could not forbear to te&s;tify, in part, the admiration &s;he in&s;pired; I prai&s;ed her ta|lents, her knowledge, and introduced the &s;ubjects of A&s;tronomy and Mathematics; but Arpali&s;a, with a tone of the utmo&s;t mo|de&s;ty, &s;topt me, by &s;aying, I am exceeding|ly vexed, my Lord, you have been per|&s;uaded I employ my lei&s;ure hours on &s;ubjects &s;o little proper for a woman; and were it true I had a ta&s;te for &s;uch &s;ciences, I would make it a law with my&s;elf never to own it. Pedantry and affectation are utter &s;trangers to my heart&mdash;And my preten&s;ions really are very few.</P>
<P>This uncommon mode&s;ty fini&s;hed her con|que&s;t. I was in tran&s;ports, and returned to my chamber only to think of Arpali&s;a. I pa&s;|&s;ed a part of the night in writing to her and making ver&s;es upon her. I invented the mo&s;t ingenious and brilliant fea&s;ts; &s;he &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of my attention; I declared
<PB N="42" REF="028733_0040_0FDBE756157BE890">
my pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he owned that, my power and rank out of the que&s;tion, &s;he partook my pa&s;&s;ion; but by an in&s;urmountable deli|cacy, &s;he never could re&s;olve to marry a Ge|nius; for, after a while, added &s;he, you might attribute that to ambition, which was the pure effect of love. Oh, that you had been born le&s;s illu&s;trious!</P>
<P>Such &s;entiments enchanted, yet drove me to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>At other moments, Arpali&s;a would vaunt the mild content of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation. I have no ambition, &s;aid &s;he, Friend&s;hip is the charm of my life; Love I have never known, and dread to know; for I have a heart too fond, a &s;en&s;ibility too delicate; I am happy and peaceable, and mu&s;t not flatter you; I cannot re&s;olve to &s;acrifice &s;uch pure and per|fect content. No, my Lord, incapable of feigning, incapable of the lea&s;t coquetry, I would not give you deceitful hopes. Quit this Palace, fly me for your own repo&s;e&mdash; and for mine.</P>
<P>Love at la&s;t, however, was triumphant, and Arpali&s;a con&s;ented to give me her hand.</P>
<P>Prudina had rendered me &s;o &s;u&s;picious, I was determined not to wed even the divine Arpali&s;a, till I had fir&s;t heard her in the Pa|lace
<PB N="43" REF="028733_0041_0FDBE79FE6F2F280">
of Truth. I doubted not her &s;incerity, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible I could &s;acrifice to her the proof of my Palace. I told her I could wed only in my territories, but took care not to mention a word of the charm. She con|&s;ented to accompany me, and only required Telira &s;hould go with her; for, &s;aid &s;he, I could not endure &s;eparation from &s;o dear a friend. We departed, and &s;oon found our|&s;elves in the avenues to my Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of this redoubted place, gave the mo&s;t lively emotions. I am going, &s;aid I, to di&s;cover the true &s;tate of the heart of her I love; if &s;he be &s;uch as I imagine, how much I &s;hall reproach my&s;elf for having thought the proof of this Ca&s;tle nece&s;&s;ary; and if &s;he be not, what an angelic illu&s;ion &s;hall I lo&s;e!</P>
<P>At la&s;t we entered the Ca&s;tle, and I ca&s;t a trembling eye on my Prince&s;s; but what was my &s;urprize, when I di&s;covered the ce|le&s;tial, the &s;eraphic Arpali&s;a, was forty-eight years old; was loaded with paint, had pen|cilled eye-brows, fal&s;e hair, and a made up form; in fine, that &s;he was bald, red-haired, old, and crooked.</P>
<P>Zumio, who had come to meet me, did not know her in the Ca&s;tle of Truth; and
<PB N="44" REF="028733_0042_0FDBE756B4F0DF28">
bur&s;t out a laughing, as &s;oon as he beheld a figure &s;o ridiculous, leaning familiarly and triumphantly on my arm. I was &s;o much di&s;|concerted that I ha&s;tily quitted the Prince&s;s, without troubling my&s;elf about what &s;he might think of my behaviour.</P>
<P>Zumio followed me; I give you joy of your good fortune, my Lord, &s;aid he; you have, indeed, found a mo&s;t rare beauty. I really wonder how you could make &s;uch a conque&s;t; your choice, however, proves how &s;ub&s;tantial your ta&s;te is, and you never need fear a rival, or the torments of jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle word deprived Zumio of all his plea&s;antry; I only named Arpali&s;a, and he &s;tood confounded and agha&s;t.</P>
<P>After a moment's &s;ilence, my Lord, &s;aid he, I ea&s;ily conceive your chagrin and di&s;|gu&s;t: but though the beauty of this Prin|ce&s;s be borrowed, though her complexion, &s;hape, and flowing hair, are all artificial, I yet flatter my&s;elf we have not been deceived in her &s;oul, her under&s;tanding, and talents; and as &s;he has &s;aid &s;he loves you, I am per|&s;uaded you will find &s;he &s;poke truth.</P>
<P>If &s;o, &s;aid I, Zumio, If I have had the mis|fortune to make &s;uch a woman love me,
<PB N="45" REF="028733_0043_0FDBE7A22E12D490">
what will become of me? My only con&s;ola|tion, my only hope, is to find her perfidious.</P>
<P>An attendant now came, to tell me the Prince&s;s was inquiring for me, and decorum obliged me to go.</P>
<P>I found her alone in a chamber, and ex|tended on a couch, &s;he had a handkerchief and a &s;melling-bottle, and, as &s;oon as &s;he per|ceived me, began to make the mo&s;t &s;trange contortions.</P>
<P>What ails you, madam! &s;aid I; are you not well?</P>
<P>She made no reply, but continued her contortions, and I repeated my que&s;tion. She then ca&s;t a langui&s;hing look at me, and &s;aid, I am pretending to be in a fit.</P>
<P>I &s;ee you are, replied I.</P>
<P>Well, and are not you affected?</P>
<P>How can I avoid it? But why are you in a fit?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e you left me &s;o coldly, when I en|tered the Palace; and I want to per&s;uade you my &s;en&s;ibily is exce&s;&s;ive, and that I pa&s;&s;ion|ately love you.</P>
<P>And do you really love me?</P>
<P>I! not the lea&s;t in the world. I love no|thing.</P>

the mo&s;t tender things po&s;&s;ible, pretend-to weep and dry her eyes, and I recovered. Freed from all inquietude, I now thought proper to prolong a conver&s;ation which di|verted me; and taking Arpali&s;a by the hand, You quite melt me, &s;aid I; who can be in|&s;en&s;ible to &s;o many charms, and &s;o much love?&mdash;But how your hand &s;hakes!</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid &s;he, I do that on purpo&s;e, to make you believe I have convul&s;ive motions.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be very fatiguing.</P>
<P>Not in the lea&s;t, habit has made me ex|pert.&mdash;But you &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee &s;ome|thing more; I have not played half my tricks yet; before we have done you &s;hall &s;ee me faint.</P>
<P>Pray, tell me what is become of Telira.</P>
<P>Oh, we have quarrelled.</P>
<P>What, already?</P>
<P>Yes, and I mean to per&s;uade you, that Telira is in part the cau&s;e of the &s;ituation in which you now &s;ee me.</P>
<P>Why, what has pa&s;&s;ed between you?</P>
<P>Oh! you never heard &s;uch in&s;olence; &s;he told me I was deceitful, vain, envious, in&s;en&s;ible; that my pride was unmea&s;ured, my ambition in&s;atiable. I replied, I had never really loved her; that it was all affec|tation,
<PB N="47" REF="028733_0045_0FDBE7A39CD0A5E0">
and that had &s;he been hand&s;omer and more amiable, &s;he would have given me offence; that I had not the lea&s;t regard for her, nor would make the lea&s;t &s;acrifice to &s;erve her.</P>
<P>It is inconceivable that this &s;hould vex her.</P>
<P>Oh! &s;he left the room in a fury.</P>
<P>Did you ever repo&s;e confidence in her?</P>
<P>I never had confidence in any per&s;on. I de&s;ire no friends but dupes and &s;laves; not but I have often confided my &s;ecrets, but then it was merely through vanity; and I always di&s;gui&s;ed or altered facts, and added circum&s;tances, for lies co&s;t me nothing when they would give me con&s;equence.</P>
<P>You are quite adorable, and &s;o benevo|lent!</P>
<P>Yes, I love pomp and &s;hew exce&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P>When we are united, you &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of all my trea&s;ures. How many wretches will you relieve with my wealth?</P>
<P>Oh! I will certainly keep it all my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Divine Arpali&s;a, how you enchant me! What an a&s;toni&s;hing union of Virtue, Wit, and Knowledge; for it is in vain you would deny you are as learned as beautiful? Your Courtiers told me all; they a&s;&s;ured me the evening before we departed, there was not

<P>They are paid to &s;ay &s;o, and are di&s;graced if they do not. I am exceedingly ignorant, though I wi&s;h to be thought otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>How mode&s;t!&mdash;and then your paint|ings&mdash;</P>
<P>Are every one done by Zolphir.</P>
<P>And the charming Symphonies&mdash;</P>

<P>You are really unique in this world.</P>
<P>It is certain no per&s;on ever had more art, or carried di&s;&s;imulation farther; for I have impo&s;ed upon the mo&s;t knowing and clear-&s;ighted people.</P>
<P>Arpali&s;a in pronouncing this phra&s;e, cer|tainly intended a mo&s;t mode&s;t an&s;wer; for &s;he took &s;o humble an air, with down-ca&s;t eyes, and made &s;uch comic and ridiculous grimaces, that I could with difficulty re|&s;train my&s;elf from laughter. Her tone of voice, and the faces &s;he made, agreed &s;o ill with what &s;he uttered, and formed a contra&s;t &s;o &s;ingular and plea&s;ant, that I found it im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain the conver&s;ation any long|er. I ro&s;e to leave her; &s;he called me with a feeble voice, telling me, at the &s;ame time, &s;he was going to clo&s;e her eyes, and to fall
<PB N="49" REF="028733_0047_0FDBE7A7DD458BA8">
into dreadful convul&s;ions. I got away, and went to relate my adventure to the Sylph and the Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>You pretend, &s;aid I to Gelanor, this Ca&s;tle can only give me pain, and that it can never be of u&s;e to me while I am attatched to the world; that, in a word, it is only fit for one who is already undeceived by rea&s;on, and freed from the power of the pa&s;&s;ions; but do you not now &s;ee its u&s;e? For had not I brought Arpali&s;a hither, I &s;hould have mar|ried a woman at once old, ugly, deceitful, ambitious, and wicked.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, replied Gelanor, you might, without &s;etting foot in this Ca&s;tle, have ea&s;ily &s;een this woman nearly as &s;he is, had you been le&s;s &s;ubject to take things on tru&s;t, and had you le&s;s vanity. Learn to &s;ee with your own eyes, to judge from facts, and not from the opinions of others; do not &s;o ea&s;ily believe it is impo&s;&s;ible when you think proper to act the lover, you &s;hould not be beloved; and I may a&s;&s;ure you, that you will in no part of the world become the dupe of &s;uch women as Arpali&s;a.</P>
<P>Do you think it no advantage, &s;aid I, a lit|tle touched, to hear a Philo&s;opher &s;peak to me with &s;o much freedom.</P>

them amends; they hate openly, exclaim, &s;cold, and continue an eternal uproar, of which you can form no idea.</P>
<P>And how do the women behave?</P>
<P>More ridiculous in general than the men; the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ubject engenders mortal hatred, and they di&s;cover fal&s;ehood &s;o meditated, and artifices, often &s;o puerile, as &s;carcely to be credited. One tells us, &s;he hopes we &s;hall believe the &s;ight of a Spider makes her ill&punc; another, that &s;he is going to make us imagine &s;he &s;hall fall into hy&s;terics at the &s;ight of a Cat; and even when they have no particular views to an&s;wer, &s;ome will practi&s;e deceit, for &s;o they think they do, merely for amu&s;ement: but, continued Zumio, co|quettes are mo&s;t of all di&s;gu&s;ting, for they di&s;cover &s;o much effrontery, &s;entiments &s;o perver&s;e, tricks &s;o ab&s;urd, &s;o&mdash;</P>

I looked, li&s;tened, and en|vied the happine&s;s of Zumio; but as, thanks to the Box which the King of the Genii had given me, I could di&s;&s;emble my thoughts, I did not inform Ro&s;amond of the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion &s;he made upon my heart; I con|tented my&s;elf with only reading her's; &s;he told me &s;he was neither coqueti&s;h nor incon|&s;tant; that Zumio was the fir&s;t object &s;he had loved; that &s;he had not any violent pa&s;|&s;ion for him at pre&s;ent, but that &s;he felt her love would &s;oon equal Zumio's.</P>
<P>I quitted Ro&s;amond, enchanted by her beauty, wit, and character. In the even|ing I was out of temper, and e&s;pecially with Zumio; he complained; I became more vexed, and drove him from my pre&s;ence, but called him back a moment after, not to do him ju&s;tice, but to prevent his being with Ro&s;amond; I felt my own tyranny, which love would not of it&s;elf have produced; but

Zumio enraged me, by the rudene&s;s and &s;everity of his expre&s;&s;ions and reproaches.</P>
<P>The &s;age Gelanor in vain endeavoured to make peace between us; alas, &s;aid he, were you not in this Ca&s;tle, and otherwi&s;e in the &s;ame &s;ituation, Zumio would di&s;gui&s;e his injurious fears, and exce&s;&s;ive re&s;entment, and appear mild and moderate, and you would then be equitable and generous. Re|member, my Lord, he is forced to &s;peak what he thinks; remember he is under the dominion of love and anger, and that to|morrow he will not think as he does to-day.</P>
<P>Do you not &s;ee, exclaimed Zumio, that Phanor only wants a pretext to bani&s;h me the Ca&s;tle, that he may drive me from Ro&s;|amond; for do not &s;uppo&s;e, that he, like us, is obliged to &s;peak what he thinks; his art pre&s;erves him from any &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity: he will not own it, becau&s;e he is naturally &s;u&s;picious&punc; but I have found him out in more than twenty fal&s;ehoods: thus while he reads our &s;ecrets, in &s;pite of our&s;elves, his own are locked up. What cowardice! what unworthy meanne&s;s!</P>
<P>This reproach, which I but too much merited, drove me &s;o furious, that had it not been for Gelanor, I &s;hould certainly
<PB N="57" REF="028733_0055_0FDBE7B26B752AF8">
have committed &s;ome fatal crime. Stop, madman, cried the Philo&s;opher, &s;top, com|plete not your di&s;honour by avenging your|&s;elf on a defencele&s;s Rival.</P>
<P>The authoritative voice of virtue brought me to my&s;elf; but Gelanor could not con|vince me of my error without vexing me; I left him ha&s;tily, and went and &s;hut my&s;elf in my own apartment, that I might indulge, with|out con&s;traint, my chagrin and ill-humour.</P>
<P>I became gloomy, impatient, moro&s;e, fled &s;ociety, wandered mournfully in my Ca&s;tle, and &s;ought for Ro&s;amond again&s;t my will; &s;he avoided me when I endeavoured to ap|proach her; I &s;aw &s;o much perplexity and di&s;dain in her countenance that I dur&s;t not &s;peak.</P>
<P>I found her one evening alone in the gar|den, &s;itting in a bower, plunged in a deep reverie. I advanced, and perceiving &s;he had been weeping, I a&s;ked her the cau&s;e of her inquietude? She &s;ighed, Zumio, replied &s;he, has ju&s;t left me; I &s;aw he was di&s;&s;atisfi|ed with me, and that afflicts me.</P>
<P>Di&s;&s;atisfied! &s;aid I, with extreme plea|&s;ure, why?</P>
<P>Ro&s;amond made me no an&s;wer, except by a look of indignation. In vain did I pre&s;s

and que&s;tion her; &s;he was ob&s;tinately &s;ilent; hope entered my heart. Zumio was di&s;&s;atisfi|ed&mdash;Ro&s;amond dur&s;t not &s;peak; I imagined &s;he read my heart and was affected: all my re&s;olutions, all the obligations I had to Zu|mio's attachment were forgotten. I fell at her feet, and declared my love in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate terms. I could obtain no an&s;wer, but neither could I ob&s;erve the colouring of anger on the beauteous cheeks of Ro&s;a|mond; on the contrary, I thought her eyes &s;poke &s;atisfaction. I again &s;olicited an an|&s;wer with fre&s;h ardour; Ro&s;amond, &s;till mute, made a motion as if to ri&s;e and fly me. I fearing to di&s;plea&s;e, would not con|&s;train, and therefore left her.</P>
<P>Full of hope, or rather not doubting my happine&s;s, I &s;ought for &s;olitude to think on Ro&s;amond. I had walked thus two hours, when Zumio &s;uddenly appeared, animated by the mo&s;t violent rage. So, perfidious Spirit, cried he, you have &s;educed Ro&s;a|mond. I have ob&s;erved for &s;ome days pa&s;t her &s;ilence and thoughtfulne&s;s, and at la&s;t the Die is ca&s;t; &s;he has declared &s;he loves me no longer, but that &s;he adores you.</P>
<P>Zumio! What is it you tell me! Dear|e&s;t Zumio! I am &s;orry for you&mdash;But oh!

be generous enough to &s;acrifice your love.</P>
<P>I am obliged to &s;acrifice it, but at the &s;ame time my friend&s;hip for you is gone.</P>
<P>Nay, Zumio&mdash;</P>
<P>You merit not a friend; nor will I ever forget or forgive treachery &s;o black.</P>
<P>Accu&s;e me not of treachery, Zumio, for you never confided in me. You &s;u&s;pected me before I thought of Ro&s;amond; had it not been for your unju&s;t jealou&s;y, your in|jurious reproaches and pa&s;&s;ions, Phanor had never been your rival; but you in&s;ulted, vexed, aggravated me, and &s;o highly of|fended me, that for a moment I forgot our friend&s;hip. I have been weak, but not per|fidious; be&s;ides, in robbing you of Ro&s;a|mond's heart, I have broken no &s;acred en|gagements; &s;he had not promi&s;ed to give you her hand. Hope was all &s;he had grant|ed. Triumph then, dear Zumio, over your re&s;entment, and make not my wrongs great|er than they are. Ro&s;amond is altered, think not of her, and torment me not with &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing complaints.</P>
<P>When I had &s;aid this, I drew near to take Zumio in my arms; but he immediately drew back; and run off, &s;aying, <HI>I dete&s;t you.</HI></P>

She received me at fir&s;t with great perplex|ity; but how exce&s;&s;ive was my joy, when &s;he blu&s;hing owned &s;he loved me, and me only; that &s;he had never felt for Zumio more than an emotion of preference, but her love for me was real.</P>
<P>Do you indeed love me for my&s;elf, cried I, has ambition no&mdash;Here Ro&s;amond in|terrupted me;&mdash;dare you pre&s;ume to think it; bani&s;h &s;uch &s;u&s;picions, my Lord, they are in&s;ults.

<P>You may more ea&s;ily imagine, than I de|&s;cribe, the motions I felt at hearing an an|&s;wer like this in the Ca&s;tle of Truth.

day. The news &s;oon re&s;ounded through the Ca&s;tle. As for Arpali&s;a, &s;he had known the Charm above a fortnight, and had &s;hut her|&s;elf up in her apartment there, to hide from all eyes her fury and her &s;hame; and there to wait, as &s;he did with inexpre&s;&s;ible impa|tience, the expiration of the three months, which &s;he was obliged to remain in this en|chanted Ca&s;tle. Zumio, become my enemy, was with her; for my own part, being to|tally occupied about Ro&s;amond, I neither felt the happine&s;s of being ju&s;tly de&s;pi&s;ed, nor was I in a condition to think of the wrong I had done.</P>
<P>It was a long and weari&s;ome night! Hy|men's torch was not to be lighted till day, and then I was to wed the mo&s;t beautiful and lovely lady upon earth. Certain of her virtue, the goodne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, the purity of her mind, &s;ure of being pa&s;&s;iona|tely beloved. I again found that bli&s;s which, for a moment, Agelia taught me to ta&s;te. Ro&s;amond, le&s;s lively, le&s;s poignant than Agelia, had neither her caprices nor &s;ingu|larities, but the happine&s;s I anticipated with her, promi&s;ed to be more permanent and &s;ub&s;tantial, as I thought.</P>
<P>Aurora no &s;ooner begun to &s;end her

beams into my chamber, than I, unable to re&s;train my impatience, ro&s;e and flew to Ro&s;amond's apartment. I took a ba&s;ket, garni&s;hed with flowers and precious &s;tones, into which I put a billet, which I was de&s;i|rous &s;he &s;hould receive when &s;he awaked; and I entered her chamber, without either being &s;een or heard; Ro&s;amond was a|&s;leep; and, after having placed the ba&s;ket at her feet, I he&s;itated a little, her beauties a&s;toni&s;hing me.</P>
<P>The mere&s;t accident cau&s;ed me to ca&s;t my eye on her table, ju&s;t as I was about to re|tire; but what was my &s;tupefaction, when I beheld, upon that table the Box, the Ta|li&s;man, which the Sovereign of the Genii had given me, that I my&s;elf &s;hould not be &s;ubjected to the charm of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;ed I had been mi&s;taken by an ac|cidental re&s;emblance; for &s;earching in my pocket, I there found a box: I again re|covered my breath, took confidence, exa|mined carefully, and thought that that I found in my pocket was the true one. Tak|ing up the other, however, which lay on the table, for farther conviction, I could no lon|ger doubt my misfortune. I perfectly &s;aw by comparing them together, that Ro&s;a|mond's
<PB N="63" REF="028733_0061_0FDBE7B89E645D70">
was the Tali&s;man, and that which I had was a counterfeit.</P>
<P>Amazed and perplexed, I could form no probable conjecture concerning this adven|ture, but took the Tali&s;man, put the coun|terfeit on the table, again &s;natched up my ba&s;ket, in order to retire ha&s;tily, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>My vexation and pa&s;&s;ion I cannot de&s;cribe. I knew not how or when Ro&s;amond had pro|cured my Tali&s;man, but it was evident there was treachery at the bottom. So then! cried I, all the power of magic is unable to cope with the perfidy of women; even here in this Ca&s;tle, they fall upon &s;chemes to im|po&s;e on us.</P>
<P>Whenever Ro&s;amond aro&s;e, I waited on her; I was in great agitation, which &s;he &s;oon perceived, and enquired the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I have had &s;ome di&s;agreeable thoughts, I replied, and &s;omehow I dread that Zumio &s;hares your affections.</P>
<P>You wrong me much indeed then.</P>
<P>I was tran&s;ported at hearing this, and was re&s;tored almo&s;t to my former Paradi&s;e, when &s;he &s;aid,</P>
<P>My con&s;tancy is un&s;haken; my virtue is real and not to be &s;haken; you are going

to become my &s;hu&s;band, and I would prefer death to the infamy of betraying you, I made no promi&s;e to Zumio, commit no crime in renouncing him, and my pride is gratified by &s;acrificing my Love.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you, replied I, in a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Why are you &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;aid Ro&s;amond? are you not convinced of my Love?</P>
<P>Do you think I &s;hould?</P>
<P>Indeed I mu&s;t confe&s;s it is Zumio I love; but my virtue might ea&s;ily triumph over that inclination, for I will &s;ee Zumio no more, but attach my&s;elf to you; gratitude and duty are all powerful over my heart; you are vain, I am virtuous, and I can ea&s;ily make you believe I love you above all men.</P>
<P>I now found it impo&s;&s;ible to keep within bounds; my pa&s;&s;ion overcame me, and Ro&s;amond &s;oon perceived I had found out the deception of the Tali&s;man.</P>
<P>Alas! exclaimed &s;he, now will Zumio have ample vengeance on his ambitious mi&s;|tre&s;s and perfidious friend, and heaven is ju&s;t. Yes, my Lord, ambition &s;educed my &s;oul; informed of your pa&s;&s;ion by Zumio, I regretted the rank and power which &s;uch a marriage would confer on your con&s;ort;
<PB N="65" REF="028733_0063_0FDBE7BF9FD903E0">
Zumio enraged, overwhelmed me with re|proaches, and irritated me; I commanded him to leave me; you &s;oon after appeared, and unwilling you &s;hould know my thoughts, I determined to to be &s;ilent; &s;carce had you quitted me, ere I &s;aw &s;hining among the green herbs, the fatal Tali&s;man, which in all likelihood, had fallen out of your pocket when you &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately threw your&s;elf at my feet; by a very &s;ingular chance, I hap|pened to po&s;&s;e&s;s a box of rock cry&s;tal, very like your Tali&s;man, and at fir&s;t I thought it was my own box: but examining fur|ther, I di&s;covered the my&s;tic characters which are engraved upon the lid, I then no longer doubted it was a Tali&s;man. Zu|mio had told me the enchantment of the Ca&s;tle had no effect on you; and I gue&s;&s;ed that this box was the pre&s;ervative which might, perhaps, guard you from the effects of this dangerous charm; I immediately ran to my chamber, &s;ought for, and found my own box, and with a diamond's point, traced, and perfectly imitated the my&s;teri|ous cyphers. This operation over, Zumio came, and on him I fir&s;t tried the virtue of your Tali&s;man; I told him I did not love him, and found the box gave me the ca|pability
<PB N="66" REF="028733_0064_0FDBE778E15F0F70">
of di&s;gui&s;ing my thoughts. Zumio left me in de&s;pair; I went to find and meet you. I had but one fear, which was, that you had di&s;covered my theft, though &s;carce|ly two hours had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince it had hap|pened; but &s;oon found you had not. While you expre&s;&s;ed your tran&s;ports, I adroitly &s;lipt my cry&s;tal box into your pocket, and kept yours. I knew the cheat mu&s;t in time be di&s;covered, if we remained here, but I flattered my&s;elf I &s;hould ea&s;ily prevail on you quickly to quit this Ca&s;tle. I had been tempted by opportunity, &s;purred on by am|bition, I had not lei&s;ure to weigh coolly the dangers of an undertaking at once &s;o fooli&s;h and improper.</P>
<P>My Lord, you are now acquainted with every thing concerning this affair; and I &s;in|cerely regret having deceived you; I re|proach my&s;elf more for having &s;acrificed Zu|mio; but I have di&s;covered no malice, have not deba&s;ed my&s;elf; and though deprived of the Tali&s;man, and obliged to &s;peak truth, I &s;till can &s;ay I love virtue; and that I never &s;hould have violated its &s;acred duties, had I become your wife, in con&s;equence of my plan.</P>
<P>I was now compelled to love Ro&s;amond
<PB N="67" REF="028733_0065_0FDBE7C0E7857268">
with all her ambition; penetrated with re|gret, overwhelmed with de&s;pair, and more in love than ever, I ca&s;t my&s;elf at her feet. Oh, Ro&s;amond! cried I, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to vanqui&s;h the pa&s;&s;ion you cannot par|ticipate; I am not beloved; but deign, at lea&s;t, to give me the right ever to love you; deign &s;till to reign in this Ca&s;tle; let Hy|men for ever unite your de&s;tiny to mine. Come, I am ready to attend you to the Al|tar.</P>
<P>I am neither bold, my Lord, nor mean; had I married you, I doubt not you &s;hould have been happy; but now when even that hope is fled, I never will be yours.</P>
<P>This uncommon delicacy delighted me, and I vainly e&s;&s;ayed to vanqui&s;h it; &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her refu&s;al; I again &s;aw Zumio; told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed. She took the re&s;olution, the &s;ame day, to quit the Ca&s;tle of Truth, and Zumio declared he was de|termined to follow her. I flatter my&s;elf, ad|ded he, that when we have left this accur&s;|ed Ca&s;tle, Ro&s;amond may per&s;uade me &s;he has only been guilty of a &s;light wrong to|wards me, the remembrance of which I ought to lo&s;e.

<P>And will you, Zumio, abandon me?</P>
<P>As Ro&s;amond loves you not, I no longer hate you; but my re&s;entment again&s;t you is &s;till &s;trong; were I able to conceal it, as I have &s;till much attachment for you in my heart, and likewi&s;e much compa&s;&s;ion, I might be capable to con&s;ole you, and ex|cite your gratitude and admiration, by &s;a|crificing a woman, who, it mu&s;t be owned, would have &s;acrificed me; but you rend my heart, I can di&s;gui&s;e nothing; it is not po&s;|&s;ible to &s;hew my&s;elf more generous, or le&s;s vindictive than I really am; be&s;ides, &s;hould I hereafter repent the having made &s;uch a &s;a|crifice, you would in&s;tantly know it, and I &s;hould lo&s;e its fruits; therefore, adieu, my Lord; and if you wi&s;h to pre&s;erve friends, follow my coun&s;el, and take another dwel|ling.</P>
<P>To add to my grief, Zumio left me and followed Ro&s;amond; thus, in one unhap|py day, my friend and mi&s;tre&s;s for&s;ook me.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;opher remained; prompted by his curio&s;ity, he continued in a place, which furni&s;hed a Philo&s;opher with many &s;ubjects for reflection. Touched to &s;ee my profound

<P>As I was walking one day through a bow|er of myrtles and orange trees, Gelanor came to &s;eek me. Here are two gue&s;ts, &s;aid he, a man and a woman of a delightful form, who have unthinkingly entered the Ca&s;tle, and are exceedingly afflicted to learn they are obliged to remain here three months; they are con&s;ulting together, and I believe, mean to a&s;k your permi&s;&s;ion to be married here; but, in all likelihood, a quarter of an hour's conver&s;ation will rob them of that wi&s;h, for no more time is re|qui&s;ite here to make a breach between the happie&s;t of lovers.</P>
<P>While Gelanor was thus &s;peaking, the youth approached: I advi&s;ed him, enquiring if he yet continued firmly re&s;olved to marry his mi&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>I am indeed, my Lord, &s;aid he, and as my re&s;olution is not occa&s;ioned by Love, there is the le&s;s fear of a relap&s;e.</P>
<P>And are you not in love?</P>

<P>But friend&s;hip and honour made me again recollect my engagements; I continued my travels, and found the woman I had &s;o pa&s;|&s;ionately loved, but who now was no more than a dear and intere&s;ting friend. She was deeply affected by all I had done for her; in|capable of deceiving me, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed &s;he no longer had the power of participating that love &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed we in&s;pired; for that du|ring &s;o long an ab&s;ence, another object had touched her heart.

<P>Love no longer influenced Nadir; Agelia felt only friend&s;hip for him; hope again &s;e|duced me; I &s;poke to, conjured Agelia to prefer me to the indifferent Nadir: remem|ber, &s;aid I, that I love you to exce&s;s, while he does not.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="028733_0071_0FDBE816DD315BB0">Love, my Lord, &s;aid Agelia, evapo|rates, but the remembrance of generous ac|tions remains, and this it is which makes at|tachments durable. I might forget the love of Nadir, but never that he has travelled almo&s;t through the world for the&s;e three years, in hopes of &s;erving me.</P>
<P>Alas! replied I, and mu&s;t I &s;ee you in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nadir, and be driven to ex|tremity?</P>
<P>Such extremity is the whim of an hour. Can you &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k me to &s;acrifice &s;o faith|ful, &s;o generous a friend?&mdash;You who had not the trifling merit (trifling, becau&s;e it is involuntary) to regret for any rea&s;onable &s;pace of time, the mi&s;tre&s;s whom you had lo&s;t by your own fault; the inhabitants of this Ca&s;tle are not remarkable for their ta|citurnity; I have que&s;tioned them, and, you may well &s;uppo&s;e, know the Anecdotes of Arpali&s;a and Ro&s;amond: &s;peak not then to me of a pa&s;&s;ion I no longer feel. Open your eyes, my lord? you are born virtuous and amiable; but while you pre&s;erve this injurious &s;u&s;picion and imprudent curio&s;ity, which characteri&s;e you at pre&s;ent, you nei|ther can know repo&s;e nor happine&s;s. Think what this fatal infatuation of wi&s;hing to pe|netrate
<PB N="74" REF="028733_0072_0FDBE7CAA0A9B990">
the &s;ecret foldings of the heart you love has already co&s;t you: without men|tioning my&s;elf; remember Ro&s;amond, who was charming, &s;incere, virtuous, &s;en&s;ible of benefits, capable of gratitude, and, in any other place but this, of making you per|fectly happy. Remember the amiable little Zumio, who &s;o &s;incerly loved you, and whom you drove from you. Oh cea&s;e, my Lord, to wi&s;h to de&s;troy nece&s;&s;ary illu&s;ions; abandon this fatal Ca&s;tle, or for ever re|nounce friend&s;hip, love, &s;ociety, and, in fact, all tho&s;e connections and enjoyments which render life comfortable.</P>
<P>What &s;he &s;aid, &s;truck me the more, be|cau&s;e Agelia, with firmly not to be &s;haken, per&s;i&s;ted in her re&s;olution to wed Nadir. Unable to &s;upport the cruel &s;ight, I came at length to a determination; and wi&s;hing, at lea&s;t to gain the e&s;teem of Agelia, heaped be|nefits on Nadir; left the Ca&s;tle, engaging my&s;elf never to enter the&s;e gates if impelled by jealou&s;y or &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>I think, replied Agelia, your engage|ment would be more to the purpo&s;e, were you never to come here again on any ac|count whatever.</P>
<P>It is not in my power to engage for that,
<PB N="75" REF="028733_0073_0FDBE81ABA2F7260">
an&s;wered I, but to prove to you I do not intend to come often, or &s;tay long, I here give you, deare&s;t Agelia, the Tali&s;man, which the ambitious Ro&s;amond once pur|loined; this box, as you know; is a cer|tain pre&s;ervative again&s;t the enchantment of the Ca&s;tle; you are obliged to &s;tay here three months, and in that time it may be of &s;ome &s;ervice to you. Farewell for ever.</P>
<P>If you allow me to give it to Nadir, re|plied Agelia, I will accept it; deceit is al|ways painful, but to be deceived is often the greate&s;t of plea&s;ures. If he &s;hould dive into my thoughts; &s;o therefore allow me to put your Tali&s;man into his hands.</P>
<P>The Tali&s;man is yours, do with it what you think proper, to your happine&s;s I &s;acri|fice it; but now, obliged as I am to &s;peak what I think, deign, for the la&s;t time, to hear a faithful avowal of the pa&s;&s;ion you in|&s;pire. Never, Agelia, have I loved any as I have loved you; never &s;hall I forget you. Adieu! pity the unhappy Phanor; for your compa&s;&s;ion and regard is the only mitigations my grief permits.</P>
<P>While I thus &s;poke, I ob&s;erved the tears of the lovely feeling Agelia begin to flow; too much affected to reply, &s;he gave me her
<PB N="76" REF="028733_0074_0FDBE7CAA4A74530">
hand, which I bathed with my tears.&mdash;At length I tore my&s;elf from her, quitted her for ever, left the Ca&s;tle of Truth, and I have never &s;ince returned to it.</P>
<P>Phanor having thus fini&s;hed his &s;tory, thus addre&s;&s;ed Altemira.&mdash;This is the &s;ecret I have had the fortitude, for &s;ixteen years, to conceal. Never, dear Altemira, have I doubted your virtue or affection: the Ca|&s;tle of Truth cannot add to the e&s;teem I have for you; it might enfeeble, or at lea&s;t di&s;turb, for a moment, that &s;incere attachment by which we are at pre&s;ent united; and, if you take my advice you will never attempt a journey of &s;uch ri&s;que.</P>
<P>My dear Phanor, replied Altemira, I am anxious to have an opportunity of repeating, in the Ca&s;tle of Truth, that I never loved any but Phanor.</P>
<P>Such a declaration was in in &s;ome degree agreeable to the Genius, e&s;pecially that the Queen was &s;o firmly re&s;olved, &s;ince it prov|ed &s;o well her virtue; he only required &s;he &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly reflect for &s;ix months; and if, &s;aid he, you are then of that mind, we will immediately pro&s;ecute the journey.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="028733_0075_0FDBE81C5CBFAE20">The time being elap&s;ed, Altemira was anxious to depart, and take with her her daughter, and Prince Philamir, who was to e&s;pou&s;e Zeolide. My daughter, &s;aid &s;he, is certain of the heart of Philamir; but &s;he de&s;ires he &s;hould read hers likewi&s;e, and, ere he receives her hand be a&s;&s;ured of her faith. The Prince knows the effects of the Ca&s;tle, yet ardently wi&s;hes to go with us; Zeolide wi&s;hes to take her dear and amia|ble friend, Palmis, &s;o beloved by her and us, and whom I propo&s;e acquainting what is the charm of the Ca&s;tle this evening.</P>
<P>I have a plan al&s;o, replied Phanor, to take thither three or four Courtiers, whom I &s;hould not be &s;orry to know, and whom I &s;hall not inform of the &s;ecret of the much to be dreaded place whither they are going; for were I &s;o to do, I imagine they would find &s;ome pretext to be excu&s;ed taking &s;uch a journey: on which account, Philamir and Zeolide, mu&s;t be enjoined in &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>Altemira and Zeolide, that night, con|fided the &s;ecret to their friend, and Palmis at fir&s;t &s;hewed more &s;urprize than eagerne&s;s to take this journey. However, after &s;ome reflection, Palmis &s;aid, I have nothing e&s;|&s;ential
<PB N="78" REF="028733_0076_0FDBE7CF24E6BB48">
to reproach my&s;elf of; my attach|ment to you is genuine, not feigned, I there|fore wi&s;h to attend you.</P>
<P>Palmis acknowledged at &s;ame time &s;he loved a young Courtier, named Chri&s;el, who&s;e natural levity &s;he feared. Chri&s;el was a man of fa&s;hion, and &s;uch a quality does not in&s;pire love with confidence. Palmis wi&s;hed her lover might go with them, to which Phanor con&s;ented.</P>
<P>The hour of departure arrived, Altemira, Zeolide, Philamir, and Palmis, were the only per&s;ons who knew the &s;ecret of the Ca&s;tle of Truth; and, in proportion as they approached it, their gaiety decrea&s;ed; me|lancholy and inquietude invaded their hearts; Zeolide was the mo&s;t tranquil, but Philamir became thoughtful and ab&s;ent; the gloom of Palmis was vi&s;ible, and the Queen was alarmed at remarking the trouble of Phanor. The Courtiers, who knew not the cau&s;e, vainly endeavoured to enliven the lo&s;t gaiety of the Genius: the Queen and Zeolide, the Lover of Palmis, the amiable and brilliant Chri&s;el, never di&s;covered more grace or greater de&s;ire to plea&s;e; and when conver|&s;ing with Palmis in &s;ecret, he painted his
<PB N="79" REF="028733_0077_0FDBE820CAF8F9A8">
pa&s;&s;ion with &s;o much feeling and heat, that her &s;u&s;picions vexed her.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e Courtiers who attended Phanor, was a man of an odd character, &s;eldom met with in Courts. Ari&s;teus (&s;o he was called) had done the State great &s;ervice, arrived at the highe&s;t honours by merit a|lone; he did not come to court till his youth was pa&s;t, and he brought thither a blunt|ne&s;s and moro&s;ene&s;s in his manner, that gave him an air of originality, which had the greate&s;t effect, becau&s;e it formed &s;o &s;trong a contra&s;t to the manners u&s;ually &s;een in &s;uch places. A rigid and &s;atiric Courtier is not very likely to become a favourite; but his &s;ucce&s;s for that very rea&s;on was at fir&s;t as great as his &s;ingularity amu&s;ing; but finding afterwards his under&s;tanding equal|led his ill-humour, they endeavoured too late to get him driven out; &s;o he was &s;et|tled at Court, as both Altemira and Phanor valued him.</P>
<P>But what is mo&s;t remarkable when e&s;ta|bli&s;hed there, he did not alter his behaviour; for he not only forbore fal&s;e panegyric, but he was never even heard to prai&s;e; and though very capable of zealou&s;ly &s;erving his friends, he never &s;aid an agreeable or plea|&s;ant
<PB N="80" REF="028733_0078_0FDBE7D15692A7F0">
thing, nor was a friendly offer known to e&s;cape him.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of Truth was now at hand, and Phanor had a private conver&s;ation with the Queen. I confe&s;s to you, &s;aid he, I cannot enter this Ca&s;tle, which has been &s;o fatal to me, without chagrin, nor can I di&s;|&s;emble. I &s;tand greatly in need of your in|dulgence, What hu&s;band, who has been married &s;eventeen years, can &s;ay he never has been chargeable with a fault&mdash;Too minute inve&s;tigation will rather vex you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall a&s;k you no que&s;tions then, my Lord, replied the Queen in a pet.</P>
<P>Nor will I you, &s;aid Phanor.</P>
<P>I am under no apprehen&s;ions from yours, my Lord, therefore do not fear to meet them.</P>
<P>I candidly confe&s;s to you, that as the mo&s;t &s;cruplous candour will be nece&s;&s;ary I have &s;ome dread, replied Phanor.</P>
<P>Acknowledge then, &s;aid Altemira, you at pre&s;ent deeply regret you &s;acrificed your precious Tali&s;man, which gave you the hap|py power to conceal your thoughts in the Ca&s;tle of Truth from Agelia, that beautiful fair one.</P>
<P>The Genius gave no an&s;wer but a &s;igh;
<PB N="81" REF="028733_0079_0FDBE821A0A92CF0">
and the Queen gave place to a fit of melan|choly.</P>
<P>The &s;hining walls of the Ca&s;tle now ap|peared, more than one heart was agitated, but they felt too late all the con&s;equences of &s;o dangerous a voyage. They de&s;cend, pro|ceed, and enter the fatal gates.</P>
<P>On entering the Ca&s;tle, the fir&s;t object that caught the attention of the Genius was the venerable Gelanor, the virtuous Philo|&s;opher, whom he had left above eighteen years before in the Ca&s;tle of Truth. Phanor ha&s;tily left the Queen, glad of a pretext to be at &s;ome di&s;tance from her; and ran to &s;alute Gelanor, with whom he retired into the Gardens.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid the Philo&s;opher, who is this you have brought with you?</P>
<P>A wife I have married.</P>
<P>A wife! Strange! Did you reflect well?</P>
<P>Her virtue is undoubted.</P>
<P>Many hu&s;bands, my Lord, within the&s;e nineteen years, have I known enter this Ca&s;|tle with the &s;ame &s;ecurity, and leave it con|vinced of their mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Such doubts di&s;tre&s;s not me; Altemira knows the effects of this Ca&s;tle, yet would come hither. I have little unea&s;ine&s;s con|cerning what I may know of her, but much
<PB N="82" REF="028733_0080_0FDBE7D63A9B5F48">
for what &s;he may learn of me. &mdash;But tell me, venerable Sage, &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity.&mdash; Time has not yet effaced Agelia from my memory; and every thing here recalls her rememerance&mdash;Did &s;he marry Nadir, when I left you?</P>
<P>She did, my Lord, and that very hour, gave him the Tali&s;man &s;he had of you. Na|dir, touched by &s;o delicate and generous a procedure, determined never to que&s;tion her, and thus they pa&s;&s;ed three months in the mo&s;t perfect under&s;tanding.&mdash;My Lord, take a le&s;&s;on from them.</P>
<P>If the Queen inclines, I agree.</P>
<P>As Gelanor and the Genius were thus conver&s;ing, Zeolide was walking with the Queen, and the re&s;t of the newly arrived travellers. The young Prince&s;s and Phila|mir were a little before. After a moment's &s;ilence, Philamir &s;aid, Ever &s;ince I have been in this place, I have found an in&s;urmount|able embarr&s;sment. I dare not &s;peak my thoughts; I tremble le&s;t what I &s;ay here &s;hould not &s;eem &s;ufficiently warm.</P>
<P>So then heretofore you flattered.</P>
<P>Perhaps I did.</P>
<P>Ba&s;e man! half my feelings were not ex|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="028733_0081_0FDBE82580618CA8">What an enchanting &s;peech! adorable Zeolide?</P>
<P>But, &s;ay, did you ever love me?</P>
<P>You alone I have loved: on you depends my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Enough, enough, replied the Prince&s;s. &mdash;Yes, dear Philamir, we will prove, that even this Ca&s;tle cannot be fatal to true Lovers; and that far from de&s;troying it in|crea&s;es affection, by di&s;&s;ipating all the doubts which is too often felt by a lively pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>While &s;he thus &s;poke, Altemira and Palm|is came up; Philamir left them, and the prince&s;&s;es &s;eparated them&s;elves from the groupe of Courtiers that followed them in the gardens; and Philamir and Chri&s;el went into a thicket, at the entrance of which they &s;aw a young woman &s;itting on a bank. She was hand&s;ome, and Chri&s;el would go and &s;peak to her. The Prince &s;oon found &s;he was but ju&s;t arrived, and that &s;he no more than Chri&s;el knew how impo&s;&s;ible it was to conceal her thoughts. He enquired her name; A&s;ema, &s;he replied.</P>
<P>Your manner is whim&s;ical and flirting, which is agreeable enough, &s;aid Chri&s;el, thinking he had prai&s;ed her extravagantly, and a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee with what an air of &s;ur|prize
<PB N="84" REF="028733_0082_0FDBE7D81EBD6280">
and di&s;dain &s;he received his compli|ment.&mdash;And &s;o, &s;aid he, you are a wo|man, and is not flattery agreeable.</P>
<P>Is that your flattery: you think me ug|ly, perhaps?</P>
<P>Ugly! I ju&s;t now &s;aid you are the mo&s;t delightful creature I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>You are fanta&s;ticle indeed, Sir, but it matters not; for, I value Simple Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>You have a deal of penetration indeed, Sir,</P>
<P>I am &s;ure at lea&s;t you have plenty of &s;in|cerity.</P>
<P>Lord, Sir, &s;incerity, I never &s;peak truth; it is all an air I a&s;&s;ume to impo&s;e upon you.</P>
<P>Chri&s;el could not &s;tifle a laugh, and A&s;e|ma turning towards Philamir, &s;aid, Why are you &s;o very &s;ilent, my Lord?</P>
<P>Why do you a&s;k?</P>
<P>As I would wi&s;h to make a conque&s;t of you.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay I ever met a lady &s;o &s;ingular.</P>
<P>And you delight me exceedingly; I dare &s;ay you have &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and are ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on.</P>
<P>I have been in love.</P>
<P>Very childi&s;hly I doubt not. Are you deeply &s;mitten?</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028733_0083_0FDBE826E533A6B0">Deeply, and on my &s;ucce&s;s my happine&s;s depends.</P>
<P>No doubt&mdash;and it makes me happy.</P>
<P>Why &s;o?</P>
<P>I like va&s;tly to &s;et lovers at variance. Is your mi&s;tre&s;s here?</P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P>I'll &s;eek her out, and if &s;he is hand&s;ome enough to pique my vanity, will render you faithle&s;s. I &s;hall walk this evening in the O|range-Grove; and I tell you &s;o expre&s;sly, that you may come and meet me there. So &s;aying, &s;he ro&s;e, and Philamir going to de|tain her, &s;aid, Do not you &s;ee by my air of affectation, I want to make you believe I think you a dangerous man, and con&s;equent|ly &s;hun you?</P>
<P>She then very mode&s;tly retired.</P>
<P>This lady, &s;aid Chri&s;el, is really the mo&s;t extraordinary and odd kind of per&s;on I ever met. Women are all coquettes and deceit|ful, but &s;he is the only one I have ever &s;een who was indi&s;creet enough to own it; her wi&s;h to &s;educe, and her exce&s;&s;ive impru|dence, make her truly whim&s;ical and ori|ginal. Were I in your place, my Lord, I would not neglect to meet her.</P>
<P>Is that your real opinion?</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="028733_0084_0FDBE7D9A48B6478">Certainly&mdash;would you be &s;o &s;crupulous becau&s;e you are in love with Zeolide?&mdash; Childi&s;h-folly!</P>
<P>What, replied Philamir, would it be prac|tical to turn the brain of &s;uch a coqueti&s;h girl as her?</P>
<P>I doubt not, if you manage prudently.</P>
<P>I have no &s;uch plan&mdash;Yet I have a wi&s;h to attend the appointment.</P>
<P>The &s;udden appearance of Palmis inter|rupted the conver&s;ation; &s;he had not yet an opportunity of &s;peaking alone with Chri&s;el, therefore, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw him &s;he ap|proached, and the Prince left them together. Palmis was agitated; &s;he dreaded to que&s;|tion her lover; and Chri&s;el, thinking about &s;omething el&s;e, did not remark her perplex|ity. At la&s;t Palmis, fetching a deep &s;igh, &s;aid, Why are you &s;ilent, Chri&s;el? Are you thinking of me?</P>
<P>No &s;ooner did he hear the que&s;tion, than a&s;&s;uming the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate manner po&s;&s;ible, and tenderly ki&s;&s;ing the hand of Palmis, Chri&s;el replied, Oh! no, I never think or trouble my&s;elf about you, I prote&s;t I do not.</P>
<P>How! Faithle&s;s man, cried Palmis.</P>
<P>Do you doubt my truth? Ah, Palmis, how unju&s;t you are. Yes, &s;aid he, falling
<PB N="87" REF="028733_0085_0FDBE82861D4A118">
on his knees, it has been my &s;tudy to deceive you. Ambition and vanity alone have at|tached me to you. Do ju&s;tice, Palmis, to your Lover, for he is incapable of affection; be comforted, be &s;ecure, and let the&s;e &s;in|cere prote&s;tations drive all doubts from your mind.&mdash;But why is anger &s;o vi&s;ible in your looks?&mdash;How have I offended you? And wherefore to-day will you not believe me? &mdash;Do you wi&s;h me to &s;wear?&mdash;Oaths co&s;t me nothing.</P>
<P>Wretch, cried Palmis, I can li&s;ten no longer.</P>
<P>Tears impeded &s;peech, and overwhelmed with exce&s;&s;ive grief, &s;he &s;unk on a garden-&s;eat; Chri&s;el &s;till kneeling, feigned to weep. Do not you &s;ee, &s;aid he, how I pretend to &s;hed tears: really, beauteous Palmis, you quite weary me, and though you are natural|ly as unrea&s;onable as in&s;ipid, I never before &s;aw you &s;o intolerably tire&s;ome.</P>
<P>Begone, &s;aid Palmis, repelling Chri&s;el with indignation, you give me horror.</P>
<P>There is, certainly, &s;aid Chri&s;el, &s;ome|thing I cannot under&s;tand in all this: per|haps, &s;aid he, with an air of freedom, you wi&s;h to break with me; if &s;o, &s;peak; there is no nece&s;&s;ity for all the&s;e tears, this tragic

<P>Palmis made no other an&s;wer, than by ri&s;|ing with impetuo&s;ity; and as &s;he flew from him, darted a look of contemptuous rage at Chri&s;el.</P>
<P>The Courtier &s;tood confounded, and as he reflected on this &s;trange adventure, heard a tumult of voices. He walked towards the noi&s;e, and entered into a verdant Amphithe|atre full of pa&s;&s;engers newly arrived, to the number of about thirty, &s;itting on the gra&s;s-banks, and forming a circle round Gelanor. Chri&s;el, as he entered, a&s;ked why they were all a&s;&s;embled;</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid Gelanor, for the&s;e nine|teen years I have done the honours of this Ca&s;tle; have neglected nothing to make it agreeable to &s;trangers, and have only re|quired one thing in return, which is, to fol|low me to this place, and an&s;wer a &s;ingle que&s;tion which I put to each per&s;on.</P>
<P>And what que&s;tion is that, pray?</P>
<P>I only de&s;ire to know if they are happy.</P>

<P>Let us pa&s;s on to another, &s;aid Gelanor. What &s;ay you, grave &s;tranger? addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to a little olive-coloured man with a di&s;dainful air.</P>

We wi&s;hed to reign and domineer over the minds of men; and we had a celebrated Magician for a Chief, who gave us a Tali&s;man, on which were engraven the&s;e three words, <HI>Benevolence Tolerance, Philo&s;ophy.</HI> My friend, &s;aid the Magician, the virtue of the&s;e three words is &s;uch, that to obtain your end, you have only ince&s;&s;antly to repeat them, and re&s;t faithfully attached and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to your chief.

<P>Preten&s;ions! Are you not di&s;tractedly fond of hunting, painting, mu&s;ic,&mdash;</P>
<P>I am fatigued with hunting; the be&s;t mu|&s;ic in the world to me is only noi&s;e, and I have no ta&s;te for painting; but I keep hounds, hire mu&s;icians, and buy pictures;

<P>But come, no joaking, &s;ay &s;eriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>This &s;atisfies me, replied Gelanor; and now let me que&s;tion this Lady, who is &s;itting in the mid&s;t of that agreeable group of children and young Ladies. You are the mother of a family, madam, &s;aid Gelanor.</P>
<P>My children are the&s;e around.</P>

<P>Say, my children, the que&s;tion is for you.</P>
<P>When &s;he had &s;poken, her two elde&s;t daughters, with tears of joy in their eyes, ran to her arms with the mo&s;t tender ex|expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude; and crying, with all our hearts we love her.</P>

<P>No, indeed; not even for my children; for rea&s;on and experience have taught me, honours and wealth are not the &s;ource of happine&s;s.</P>

<P>Zoram and Chri&s;el quitted the garden, and went towards the Ca&s;tle; the little Court of the Genius a&s;&s;embled in the Saloon; Ari&s;|teus the &s;atiric and &s;urly Courtier, already mentioned was &s;peaking to the Queen, who was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that he had lo&s;t &s;o much of his moro&s;ene&s;s; that his manners were more mild, and that he could &s;ay obliging things. Zoram and Chri&s;el entered the Saloon; the Prince&s;s was going to her mu&s;ic, and turning her harp, Philamir &s;at be|&s;ide her, and the &s;orrowful unhappy Palmis leaned langui&s;hingly again&s;t a pillar, thought
<PB N="94" REF="028733_0092_0FDBE7E5640F79D0">
of the perfidious Chri&s;el, and was mournful|ly &s;ilent. Chri&s;el approached Phanor, who was thoughtfully walking. Being de&s;ir|ous of &s;aying &s;omething civil of the Queen, he followed the Genius, and as &s;oon as he was near enough Altemira to be heard, &s;top|ped, and with a look of great complai&s;ance, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Genius, &s;aid, how much the Queen &s;hews her age to-day; it is not po&s;&s;ible to think that &s;he is le&s;s than thirty-eight at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Queen, though &s;till beautiful, was no longer vain of her per&s;on, but &s;miled. You flatter &s;ometimes Chri&s;el.</P>
<P>That was my inclination at pre&s;ent, ma|dam.</P>
<P>Does my dre&s;s plea&s;e you?</P>
<P>I di&s;like it much; it does not &s;uit your age.</P>
<P>Then with a mo&s;t obliging and gentle tone and manner, Chri&s;el, quite &s;atisfied with him&s;elf, and with what he had &s;aid, made his obei&s;ance and returned to the Genius.</P>
<P>Zoram went up to Palmis, and, de&s;irous of awakening her from her reverie, by incit|ing agreeable ideas in her mind, &s;aid, Good God! madam, your eyes are &s;unk in your head, and how red your no&s;e is; you do not

look hand&s;ome to-day at all. Nay, do not affect that di&s;dainful air, nor think what I &s;ay is flattery to deceive; believe me, it is the truth.</P>
<P>Zeolide was &s;itting, and preluding on her in&s;trument; Zoram, in order to maintain his reputation for a connoi&s;&s;eur pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic, ha&s;tily approached, with every de|mon&s;tration of gladne&s;s. The Prince&s;s &s;ang, and accompanied her&s;elf; Zoram li&s;tened, and beat out of time, clapping as if he had been mad. Before the air was half over, he exclaimed, &s;till continuing his hand applau&s;e, How weari&s;ome, and tire&s;ome it is!</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s was a little di&s;concerted and &s;topped; I am quite delighted, madam, &s;aid he to &s;ee you the dupe of the&s;e affected tran&s;|ports; it was to act tran&s;port, that I made this bu&s;tle.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the courtiers were a&s;toni&s;hed to hear him, and ab&s;olutely &s;uppo&s;ed poor Zoram was mad. Chri&s;el, who was particu|larly intimate with him, wi&s;hing to appear af|flicted for his misfortune, put on an air of tender amazement, and exclaimed, Poor Zoram how happy I am to &s;ee him thus! I &s;hall gain by it; I will this very evening &s;o|licit Phanor for his place.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="028733_0094_0FDBE7E65E2E1EB8">And &s;o, taking Zoram by the arm, he left the Saloon, dragging him away.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s then a&s;ked her lover, laugh|ing, if he, like Zoram, thought the air &s;he had been playing, in&s;ipid?</P>
<P>I was not attending, replied Philamir, &s;omething el&s;e took up my thoughts.</P>
<P>Zeolide blu&s;hed with vexation, and Ari&s;te|us &s;aid, I, madam, have not lo&s;t a bar of it, and I think the air a very good one, and I am in raptures with your voice.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, Ari&s;teus, interrupted the Genius, what are you becoming a gallant flatterer?</P>
<P>That I do not propo&s;e, he replied, but I am neither &s;o frigid nor unfeeling as I appear; I am &s;omewhat cro&s;s and wi&s;h to be thought &s;ingular, for which rea&s;on I pa&s;s my life in &s;narling and finding fault, entirely from a &s;pirit of contradiction; be&s;ides, I have made it a law with my&s;elf, never openly to prai&s;e nor flatter, but on important matters, and not directly.</P>
<P>How now;&mdash;I conceive your meaning; Pray, did you never flatter me?</P>
<P>I po&s;&s;e&s;s your e&s;teem, becau&s;e you believe I have not; yet love me, becau&s;e I really have; you believe, &s;imply enough, that a

man with a gruff tone and blunt manners, cannot flatter; you are &s;u&s;picious of other Courtiers, but in full &s;ecurity with me; but flattery can take various forms, nor is there more than one way to e&s;cape its &s;eductions, and that is to be in&s;en&s;ible to them. You love flattery, and I give it you; I naturally hate it, and had you de&s;pi&s;ed it, I &s;hould ne|ver have had this meanne&s;s to reproach my|&s;elf with; but thus only could I obtain your confidence; if I deceive &s;ometimes, you force me to it; and had not you corrupted me, I never &s;hould have u&s;ed artifice; I feel how much I am deba&s;ed, remember it, am enra|ged at you, and regard you not, although your &s;ervant.</P>
<P>Get out of my &s;ight, in&s;olent! cried Pha|nor, with his eyes inflamed with fury, let me never behold you again.</P>
<P>Zeolide was &s;adly affrighted at the&s;e words, &s;he ha&s;tily ro&s;e, and followed by Palmis, went into the gardens. Alas! &s;aid Zeolide, I begin to find how fatal this Ca&s;tle is; this un|fortunate Ari&s;teus, who has done the State &s;o many &s;ervices, is di&s;graced and ruined&punc; &mdash;And have I any rea&s;on to be better &s;a|tisfied? How did Philamir an&s;wer me? It was for him I &s;ang, yet he deigned not to li&s;|ten.
<PB N="98" REF="028733_0096_0FDBE7ED59C8D868">
What then did he think of? Ah! had I only enquired&mdash;I &s;ay no more.&mdash; Oh, Palmis, judge what I feel.</P>
<P>I &s;ee nothing you have to complain of, re|plied Palmis, coldly.</P>
<P>What! the indifference, the cruel di&s;dain of Philamir.</P>
<P>You are ridiculou&s;ly &s;uceptible.</P>
<P>This is a &s;trange expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Alas! I have not the power to chu&s;e.&mdash; Pardon me, madam.</P>
<P>You are not affected by my grief; I &s;ee you do not love me&mdash;Ah! no doubt, it is impo&s;&s;ible for per&s;ons of my rank to be beloved for them&s;elves. How unhappy am I!</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s could not retain her tears as &s;he &s;poke.&mdash;You are unju&s;t, replied Palm|is; do not calumniate human nature thus; if a Prince wi&s;hes to know whether the prai|&s;es given him are &s;incere, and whether he be really beloved, let him a&s;k his own heart; let him judge him&s;elf; if he di&s;dains flattery, and is capable of friend&s;hip, he may be cer|tain he has tender and faithful friends.</P>
<P>Well, Palmis, I dete&s;t flattery, and love you.</P>
<P>And I, madam, have no friend in the world &s;o dear to me as you are.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="028733_0097_0FDBE83B48EF6250">Zeolide an&s;wered Palmis by ki&s;&s;ing her with tran&s;port. Be certain, henceforth, ad|ded Palmis, your rank cannot injure the &s;en|timents you are born to in&s;pire. In our &s;e|cret conver&s;ations, your friend&s;hip and con|fidence e&s;tabli&s;hes a perfect equality between us; you are amiable, and have a feeling heart; I daily receive new benefits from you, and inclination and gratitude are the &s;a|cred ties by which we are for ever united.</P>
<P>Oh, my dear Palmis, cried Zeolide, how happy do you make me?</P>
<P>You cannot now doubt of my attachment, replied Palmis, and yet I fear this Ca&s;tle; remember, madam, that without conde&s;cen|&s;ion, without tho&s;e delicacies and attentions which come from the heart, friend&s;hip could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Zeolide a&s;&s;ured Palmis, that nothing here|after could ever deprive her of friend&s;hip and love.</P>
<P>While the two friends were thus conver|&s;ing, Philamir did not forget, that the coquette Azema had given him a rendezvous in the Orange-grove; and it &s;eemed &s;o curious and amazing to read the heart of a woman of that character, that he had not the forti|tude to re&s;i&s;t the opportunity; be&s;ides, I am

certain, &s;aid he, Azema cannot &s;educe me; Zeolide will know nothing of the affair, and con&s;equently will a&s;k no que&s;tions. The lat|ter reflection determined the Prince, and he immediately went towards the grove. Here he found Azema negligently extended on the gra&s;s, and in &s;uch a manner, as to leave a pretty foot, and the half of a pretty leg expo&s;ed. Her eyes were down-ca&s;t; &s;he &s;eemed lo&s;t in a profound reverie, and did not appear to perceive the Prince, who gent|ly approached.</P>
<P>Whenever the prince came up to her, Aze|ma affected &s;urprize, and got up&mdash;Have I frightened you, &s;aid Philamir?</P>

<P>The Prince &s;miling, &s;aid he had never &s;een any thing more charming, and Azema hid her face with her fan.&mdash;What is your rea|&s;on for that, &s;aid Philamir?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you to &s;uppo&s;e I am blu&s;hing.</P>

<P>The Prince when &s;eeing one of her hands, replied, how elegantly turned and white.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now pretend to be offended with the liberty you have taken, and pout, as you &s;ee; after which I will turn very &s;entiment|al.</P>
<P>She then drew away her hand with dig|nity, and turned her back on Philamir.&mdash; Will you be long in a pet, &s;aid he?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t to draw your attention to my fine &s;hape and flowing inglets.</P>

<P>The Prince could not with&s;tand the curi|o&s;ity he had, to know how Azema would act tenderly, and accordingly did as &s;he de&s;crib|ed.&mdash;So! &s;o! cried &s;he, and are you con|quered!</P>
<P>Say, charming girl, what you now think?</P>
<P>I am enraptured&mdash;The Prince&s;s I have &s;een and hate.&mdash;Oh! what will her vexa|tion be, when &s;he &s;hall know I have robbed her of her Lover, for know it &s;he &s;hall? and &s;oon I will tell her of it my&s;elf, for it will de|light me to &s;ee her de&s;pair.&mdash;She is &s;o beautiful, and &s;o good, that they &s;peak of nothing here but of her bounty, charms, and virtue; but I will defame her; I will &mdash;if in my power her reputation &s;hall &s;uffer.</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;aid this &s;he was &s;truck with the indignation &s;he &s;aw painted in the coun|tenance of Philamir. What, Prince, &s;aid &s;he, do you &s;u&s;pect me of affectation? Think you there is any exaggeration in the ani|mated

<P>It were to be wi&s;hed, &s;aid the Prince, ri&s;ing, that all the mon&s;ters of your &s;pecies were obliged to &s;peak with the &s;ame &s;inceri|ty, that they might only have the influence to occa&s;ion di&s;like and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>Saying this, he immediately withdrew, reflecting as he went on this adventure. In|to what &s;nares, &s;aid he, might curio&s;ity alone lead a per&s;on of my age, from a wi&s;h to &s;ee how far &s;uch a woman could go. I found my&s;elf kneeling to her; I de&s;pi&s;ed her, was not her dupe, yet &s;he amu&s;ed me; appear|ed charming; and had &s;he not di&s;covered a &s;oul &s;o ba&s;e and vile, Zeolide would for an in&s;tant have been out of mind.</P>
<P>With the&s;e reflections, Philamir returned with melancholy &s;teps towards the Ca&s;tle, when Gelanor came from a Grove, and &s;aid, Come hither, my Lord; come, and if po&s;|&s;ible, &s;top Zoram and Chri&s;el from murder|ing one another.</P>
<P>What is it you &s;ay?</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing two hours ago, acro&s;s the gar|den, they mutually accu&s;ed each other with madne&s;s; but meeting with a gue&s;t, who informed them of the virtues of the Ca&s;tle,
<PB N="104" REF="028733_0102_0FDBE7F8B6040C78">
they were terrified to think what they had &s;aid to the Genius and the Queen, and went privately to concert what mea&s;ures were be&s;t to take. From this conver&s;ation they learn, that they really had no friend&s;hip for each o|ther; each que&s;tioned, was forced to confe&s;s they had committed reciprocal wrongs for|merly and recently, till they re&s;olved to fight, and are at pre&s;ent within a few yards of us.</P>
<P>Shew me where they are, &s;aid the Prince, I will attempt to reconcile them.</P>
<P>My Lord, replied Gelanor, you know not how difficult it is to effect an agreement in the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The moment the combatants were begin|ning the attack, Philamir joined them. For|get pa&s;t grievances&mdash;be reconciled.</P>
<P>Chri&s;el in&s;tantly ran towards Zoram with a good grace, who met him with open arms. Zoram &s;aid, with a &s;miling countenance, I here vow everla&s;ting malice.</P>
<P>Chri&s;el immediately rejoined, So do I.</P>
<P>How! exclaimed the Prince?</P>
<P>Notice his ba&s;ene&s;s, cried Zoram; yet I have the &s;ame thoughts.</P>
<P>Keep &s;ilence, and be quiet, I entreat you, cried Philamir; were it in my power, my Lord, an&s;wered Chri&s;el, to deceive, I would

<P>The Prince&s;s &s;eemed &s;o re&s;erved and di&s;|tant that Philamir feared &s;he had heard of his adventure in the Orange-Grove.

<P>The adventure I have had with Azema.</P>
<P>I never heard of it, but mu&s;t now have the particulars.</P>
<P>The Prince now &s;incerely repented his in|di&s;cretion, but could not retract; he was o|bliged to &s;atisfy the jealous curio&s;ity of the Prince&s;s; was forced to own that Azema might for a moment have mi&s;led him had not her ba&s;e heart appeared.</P>
<P>So then, &s;aid the Prince&s;s, had you not been in this Ca&s;tle, and could this woman have concealed the atrocity of her mind, and the corruptne&s;s of her morals, &s;he might have &s;educed you.</P>
<P>Forget, cried the Prince, this momentary crime; my repentance is mo&s;t &s;incere; you I love, and you only.</P>

<P>Palmis vexed, retired without &s;peaking.</P>
<P>Zeolide then melting into tears, Philamir has betrayed me, and Palmis loves me no longer. I have lo&s;t them both at once&mdash; But my mother remains.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s compo&s;ed her&s;elf, and went to the Queen's apartment.&mdash;Altemira was the be&s;t and tendere&s;t of mothers; Zeolide told her of all her &s;orrows, and the Queen partook of her griefs, and even her re&s;ent|ment.

<P>Dear mother, cried Zeolide, in you I find all the tenderne&s;s I experienced before we entered this Ca&s;tle, you are the only one who&s;e kindne&s;s remains.</P>
<P>No, my daughter, there are no allu&s;ions mingled with the affections of nature; a good mother cannot &s;peak more than &s;he feels, nor paint tenderne&s;s more pa&s;&s;ionate than her heart really feels.</P>
<P>Overcome with gratitude, the Prince&s;s cla&s;ped her mother's neck, whil&s;t the tears of filial affection gladdened her maternal bo|&s;om, and mitigated one another's &s;orrows.</P>
<P>The Queen and her daughter &s;pent &s;eve|ral days in the company of each other; at la&s;t they con&s;ented to receive the &s;age and virtuous Gelanor.

the clouds that had ri&s;en. Gelanor conducted Philamir to the feet of Zeolide. The Prince&s;s wi&s;hed to a&s;&s;ure Philamir &s;he had forgotten the pa&s;t; but was forced to tell him her love was &s;ometimes le&s;&s;ened, and that &s;he &s;ecret|ly pre&s;erved a little re&s;entment and &s;u&s;pi|cion. The Prince was grieved, and was o|bliged to own too he was &s;omewhat vexed; and had it not been for the remon&s;trances and advice of Gelanor, the two lovers would have fallen out again; but they pre&s;erved appearances although it was impo&s;&s;ible to bring them again to their former happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Phanor having que&s;tioned Ari&s;teus cir|cum&s;tantially, learned, that if he had not been &s;crupulou&s;ly virtuous&punc; he had e&s;timable qua|lities; at lea&s;t, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed probity and real patriotic &s;entiments.&mdash;In Chri&s;el he di&s;|covered a flattering and ambitious Courtier, but a faithful &s;ubject; and as for Zoram, his foible was not wickedne&s;s, but folly.</P>
<P>Be conducted by my advice, &s;aid Gela|nor to the Genius; treat the&s;e courtiers with indulgence, but grant them no more a blind confidence; let them henceforth find the only means to obtain your favour is by rec|titude and virtue, and they will become new men. When Monarchs have arrived at an

age of maturity, and towards the end of their reign, they are then the real formers of Courtiers, and they are either good or bad as the monarch trains them.</P>
<P>The Genius took his advice, and recalled his three Courtiers, who had been &s;hut up in a corner of the Ca&s;tle; but &s;ociety was no longer agreeable; no per&s;on dur&s;t open his lips, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething imperti|nent; and when forced to break this ob&s;ti|nate &s;ilence, trembled as he &s;poke, and &s;el|dom uttered a word which was not either ill-timed or offen&s;ive. All execrated the Ca|&s;tle, and the only plea&s;ure they could find in it was, to entertain them&s;elves with the ma|ny &s;trangers they &s;aw.</P>
<P>One night the Prince, more di&s;contented with Zeolide, and &s;orrowful than ordinary, went to &s;eek Gelanor, and relate his new cau&s;e with grief. He had never been in the apartment of this venerable old man, but was conducted thither by an attendant. As &s;oon as he came to the door, he opened it, entered, and &s;aw a young beautiful lady, in long mourning robes, &s;itting by the Philo&s;o|pher's &s;ide, holding a book, and reading a|loud.

<P>Sure, replied the Prince, I love none but Zeolide; and as I &s;hould certainly excite her jealou&s;y, were I to &s;ee Mirza again, I en|gage to come hither again no more</P>

<P>I certainly will not, but &s;hould I find it, where &s;hall I &s;ee you?</P>

<P>With the&s;e words &s;he left him, and as &s;he went, twice turned her head to look at the Prince, who followed her with his eyes, and when he lo&s;t &s;ight of her he &s;ighed.</P>
<P>In vain the Prince endeavoured to find the pocket-book; he &s;earched the gardens round and round, but un&s;ucce&s;sfully. As, about noon, he was returning towards the Ca&s;tle, he met the three Courtiers Ari&s;teus, Chri&s;el, and Zoram, all in conver&s;ation. Surpri&s;ed to &s;ee them &s;o intimate, he approached and complimented them on the occa&s;ion. Ah!

<P>On account of alterations; there are like|wi&s;e two celebrated Authors ju&s;t arrived, whom he intends to a&s;toni&s;h and confound, by &s;hewing them his work.</P>

<P>And be&s;ides, added Philamir, his atten|tion will be wholly directed towards the&s;e newly arrived Authors, who will &s;peak with|out apprehen&s;ion, not knowing the charms of this Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>My lord, you &s;ay well; and in order to keep them in ignorance on this &s;ubject till the reading is over, they have been taken to an apartment and &s;eparate from the compa|ny.</P>

<P>You think &s;o, becau&s;e of my high &s;tation! I a&s;&s;ure you that is no impediment.

<P>The Genius's a&s;&s;urance and conver&s;ation made the Courtiers hearts &s;hrink within them. After dinner, the Genius &s;ent to in|form Learchus and Tar&s;is he was ready to receive them; and the former arriving fir&s;t, Phanor interrogated him concerning Tar&s;is. I hate him, replied Learchus, though the

principle of my hatred obliges me to di&s;&s;em|ble; I wi&s;h to &s;eem equitable; &s;ecretly I ca|lumniate, publicly I prai&s;e him, but in an artful manner; it is only to convince the world, not to do him ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Notice that! &s;aid the Genius, whi&s;pering Chri&s;el, with a &s;mile of penetration: &s;uch is the envy of which I ju&s;t now &s;poke, and hence you may imagine how much I know of the human heart.</P>
<P>Immediately Tar&s;is entered, and, after a moment's conver&s;ation, Phanor unfolded his manu&s;cript; the two authors placed them|&s;elves oppo&s;ite; Phanor thus proceeded.</P>
<P>This play I mu&s;t tell you, Gentlemen, is Capital.</P>
<P>That information, replied Learchus, is cu&s;|tomary; a reading has &s;eldom begun, till &s;omething like this has fir&s;t been &s;aid; but you need not fear, my Lord, we &s;hall none of us &s;peak a word of what we think, the highe&s;t prai&s;es will be &s;howered on you.</P>
<P>Tar&s;is was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear him: he could not conceive it po&s;&s;ible to carry truth and indi&s;cretion &s;o far.</P>
<P>The Genius &s;miled&mdash;Yes, &s;aid he, I can depend upon your &s;incerity, and am well a&s;|&s;ured you will be obliged to prai&s;e what you
<PB N="125" REF="028733_0123_0FDBE884A198DC50">
&s;hall hear. Know then, Gentlemen, you will melt into tears during the fir&s;t and &s;econd act, laugh at every &s;peech in the third and fourth, and be a&s;toni&s;hed to find the fifth &s;o &s;ublime. The &s;tyle is elegant and pure, the characters natural and well &s;u&s;tained, the plot is artfully conducted, and the denou|ment inimitable.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t indeed, cried Tar&s;is. Authors u|&s;ually &s;ay as much, but it is in a far-fetched and ambiguous manner. For my part, my Lord, I like your proud plain way better; it is at lea&s;t more comic, and may bring mo|de&s;ty into fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, replied the Genius, when I am at home, I cannot help &s;peaking thus undi&s;gui&s;edly; my language may a&s;toni&s;h, but you will &s;oon &s;ee, however, there is no|thing really ridiculous in all I have mention|ed.</P>
<P>Phanor then began to read, and, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to weep during the two fir&s;t acts, the Courtiers took out their handkerchiefs and hid their faces. The Genius &s;topped al|mo&s;t at every line: ob&s;erve, &s;aid he, how profound is that reflection! how original that thought! how philo&s;ophic this! and &s;poke &s;o continually, during the&s;e interruptions,
<PB N="126" REF="028733_0124_0FDBE8645F53BAC8">
and between the acts, and prai&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o much, that his auditors had ab&s;olutely no room to &s;ay any thing. The two authors &s;eemed very attentive, and finding the de|vice of the handkerchiefs a very happy one, they made u&s;e of the &s;ame expedient and hid their faces. Phanor triumphed when he be|held all their handkerchiefs in motion at the end of the &s;econd act. Come, come, Gentle|men, &s;aid he, the &s;erious part is over, laugh|ter now comes on.</P>
<P>He then &s;et the example, when he thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to laugh. How humorous this is, how full of wit is that, cried he every in&s;tant; there are a few free &s;trokes, and &s;ome double entendres, but the&s;e are the ta&s;te of the age, and we cannot make folks laugh without them; to unite decency and wit is too hard a ta&s;k; and, for my part, I only wi&s;h to plea&s;e, therefore, do not perplex my&s;elf about morality and good manners, but &s;acrifice them without &s;cruple, whenever I am induced either by a witty &s;troke or in|viting de&s;cription.</P>
<P>That is nothing uncommon at all, replied Learchus, we do the &s;ame; it is nece&s;&s;ary, however, for form's &s;ake, though a work may be ever &s;o licentious, to &s;catter a cer|tain
<PB N="127" REF="028733_0125_0FDBE889E489D608">
quantity of &s;entiments through it, and moral phra&s;es; after the mo&s;t free and inde|cent traits, one is charmed to &s;ee an eulogi|um on virtue; &s;uch a thing is not expected in &s;uch a place, but on that account the &s;ur|pri&s;e &s;trikes the more.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, replied the Genius, and you will find I under&s;tood this fine&s;&s;e; for my play ends with four ver&s;es, which tell the &s;pectators it has a moral purpo&s;e; though I can a&s;&s;ure you, without &s;eeking to rai&s;e my&s;elf in your e&s;teem, I had no other pur|po&s;e but that of di&s;playing my &s;uperior abi|lities. Now for the fourth act.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t we continue to laugh, &s;aid Tar&s;is?</P>
<P>So, &s;o, I under&s;tand you, Phanor replied; keep &s;ilence and attend.</P>
<P>While he read the three la&s;t &s;cenes of this act, Learchus and Tar&s;is &s;everal times endea|vored to bur&s;t into a laugh; and the Geni|us, reclining towards Zoram, &s;aid, &s;oftly, do you not ob&s;erve? envy will not let them laugh, only from the teeth outwards; how the hag gnaws their hearts; this is much more flattering to me, than all the prai&s;es they could po&s;&s;ibly give, for my pride is e|qually delicate and penetrating.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="028733_0126_0FDBE865173D14D8">When he fini&s;hed, the Genius ro&s;e, rub|bed his hands, and &s;miling, &s;aid, the&s;e gen|tlemen will now explain them&s;elves, and we &s;hall then know what ye think.</P>
<P>My Lord, I am perplexed.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;o am I.</P>
<P>I doubt it not, replied the Genius, in a rage.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y, my Lord, to prai&s;e.</P>
<P>For want of expre&s;&s;ions, no doubt&mdash;this is the highe&s;t prai&s;e.</P>
<P>How extravagant and wild is this?</P>
<P>My thrid and fourth act are out of the common road; thus you &s;ee I did not exag|gerate, when I told you you would find hu|mour ab&s;olutely run wild. It mu&s;t be own|ed, Chri&s;el, added the Genius, it is charm|ing to hear all this &s;aid in the Ca&s;tle of Truth.&mdash;What think you, Tar&s;is? Why this &s;ilence?</P>
<P>However envious, my Lord&mdash;</P>
<P>Well now! cried Phanor, tran&s;ported with joy; there Zoram, did not I predict? You hear he is devoured with envy.&mdash;But why &s;hould I longer abu&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity the&s;e poor people are under of &s;peaking what they think? I ought to be &s;atisfied, and not &s;eek to humble men too much to depre&s;s them.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="028733_0127_0FDBE88B80D6E3B8">The Genius then &s;ent the authors away, conver&s;ed &s;ome time longer with the Cour|tiers. He a&s;ked no que&s;tions for he had no doubts; he &s;poke only of his own fame, and the va&s;t &s;ucce&s;s his piece mu&s;t have. So the Courtiers got off for a little terror.</P>
<P>Whenever they got by them&s;elves, was I wrong, &s;aid Ari&s;teus, to conceive hopes of e&s;caping the danger? Every illu&s;ion vani&s;hes here, except vanity, and that is more migh|ty than all the Magicians. Love it&s;elf is not &s;o blind as an author hoodwinked by &s;elf-conceit and vanity.</P>
<P>The day following the Prince went to the Alley of Palm-trees, where he did not at fir&s;t find Mirza, but walked about expecting her arrival. After he had walked &s;ome time, he &s;aw a &s;heet of written paper on the gra&s;s in a woman's hand; he read, and was amaz|ed to find charming ver&s;es, in which Mir|za expre&s;&s;ed for Philamir a mo&s;t violent pa&s;|&s;ion&mdash;Oh! unhappy and amiable Mirza, cried the Prince, this no doubt is one of the pages of that pocket-book which thou did&s;t &s;earch for with &s;uch anxiety. The wind du|ring the night has blown it hither.&mdash;Alas! is this then the &s;ecret Mirza would hide from me? this is a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;covery indeed!</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="028733_0128_0FDBE8669D27BEC0">She immediately came in view, Philamir flew to meet her. Oh! my Lord, &s;aid Mir|za, I have ju&s;t found my pocket-book, but there is a leaf gone.&mdash;Heavens! what do I &s;ee, that very leaf in your hands&mdash; And have you read it?&mdash;Unfortunate Mirza! now is thy di&s;tre&s;s at its height.</P>
<P>When Mirza had thus &s;aid, &s;he fell on the lawn, and &s;eemed ready to faint; the Prince, quite be&s;ide him&s;elf, kneeled to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. Oh Mirza! cried he, with a broken voice, into what a dreadful di&s;tre&s;s ha&s;t thou plun|ged me? Is it po&s;&s;ible, I am indeed beloved by Mirza.</P>
<P>Har&s;h Philamar, cried Mirza, &s;ince you have read that writing, the &s;ilence I had impo&s;ed upon my lips is u&s;ele&s;s; it cannot now conceal my weakne&s;s.&mdash;Yes, I adore you. Alas! you alone have taught me to know the mo&s;t violent, the mo&s;t imperious of all the pa&s;&s;ions; never &s;hall I bani&s;h it my bo&s;om. No, I feel it will follow, or rather precipitate me into the grave. Your's I can|not be, your faith is plighted, death is my only refuge.</P>
<P>Death! &s;ay you! Heavens! cried Phila|mir, and &s;hall I be the cau&s;e of your death? &mdash;Rather let&mdash;Oh Mirza! conceive the
<PB N="131" REF="028733_0129_0FDBE890731C80D0">
horror of my &s;ituation&mdash;my engagement is &s;acred.</P>
<P>Too well I know that, cried &s;he; and were you willing to break it, I never would con|&s;ent. Zeolide is worthy to participate your happine&s;s. Love &s;hall never make me un|ju&s;t. Often has Gelanor &s;poken to me or the Prince&s;s, and intere&s;ted me in her behalf; not daring to &s;peak in your prai&s;e, I li&s;ten|ed with plea&s;ure, to the eulogiums of a la|dy &s;o dear to your heart. No, Zeolide, I cannot hate thee, for Philamir thou &s;incere|ly love&s;t.</P>
<P>Glorious &s;entiments; and do you not hate her!</P>
<P>You could not be happy without her, therefore could my life &s;ave her's, I would give it.</P>
<P>Mirza, Mirza! how you fill me with a|&s;toni&s;hment!</P>
<P>Farewel, Philamir, my heart! you know I cannot forbear repeating, and remember, <HI>I &s;peak it in the Ca&s;tle of Truth,</HI> I &s;hall love you to the la&s;t breath of life. In this bo&s;om you will ever reign, and over a heart as vir|tuous and pure as it is noble and affection|ate. Incapable of ambition and of jealou&s;y,
<PB N="132" REF="028733_0130_0FDBE86742F5A508">
I might have made you happy if&mdash;Fare|wel&punc; deare&s;t Prince, Farewel.</P>
<P>Alas! cried the Prince, this I cannot &s;upport&mdash;Oh, adorable Mirza! do you then mean to quit the Ca&s;tle? I know your three months are expired, but three weeks I am doomed to remain.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly would I leave this Ca&s;tle, repli|ed Mirza, were not Gelanor ill; but to him my attendance is nece&s;&s;ary, and I mu&s;t &s;tay. I in&s;i&s;t, however, that you come not to his apartment; and I conjure you never to con|fide to any one, the &s;ecret you thus have learnt by &s;urpri&s;e. You cannot utter a fal&s;e|hood, but you can be &s;ilent.&mdash;Again, Prince, farewel for ever.</P>
<P>With the&s;e words, Mirza ran with ex|treme precipitation; the Prince would have held her, but Mirza, with a commanding and maje&s;tic air, forbade him to follow, and Philamir was forced to obey. The charms of Mirza's per&s;on and mind, and the admiration and compa&s;&s;ion &s;he in&s;pired, did but too powerfully combat the fidelity he owed to Zeolide; his vanity too was mo&s;t potently flattered: to in&s;pire love in the brea&s;t of a lady &s;o heroically virtuous, was a triumph which Philamir could not
<PB N="133" REF="028733_0131_0FDBE8916173EF30">
help feeling. Love mu&s;t rob the beauteous and &s;ublime Mirza of life; the Prince could not doubt it: Zeolide might find con&s;olation. This was a reflection Philamir often made, yet he continued to love Zeolide. He thought the Prince&s;s much inferior to her Rival, but at the &s;ame time he found an un|known charm about Zeolide, which Mirza did not po&s;&s;e&s;s. Zeolide attracted, in&s;inu|ated, and was deeply engraven in his heart. Mirza dazzled and inflamed the imagina|tion; but &s;he was far above him; &s;he did not enrapture but amaze.</P>
<P>Afraid to di&s;cover the &s;ecret of Mirza, Philamir avoided Zeolide as much as po&s;&s;i|ble; and perceiving how mortally he dread|ed to be alone with her, rea&s;on and pride e|qually bade the Prince&s;s not &s;eek a flying Lover. After &s;o much vexation, &s;o many inquietudes, torments and &s;truggles, Zeo|lide began to &s;uffer le&s;s; &s;he had &s;een the vanity of her ideas, and love was nearly extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>At length the three weeks were at an end, and the day came, when Philamir was to quit the Ca&s;tle of Truth. Before the Prin|ce&s;s was awake, Philamir went to the alley of Palm-trees. He had a &s;trong de&s;ire yet
<PB N="134" REF="028733_0132_0FDBE86B05A03F20">
again to &s;ee Mirza, and had written to con|jure her once more to come, yet dur&s;t not hope that &s;evere Mirza would con&s;ent to re|ceive his la&s;t farewel. How great was his joy, when he &s;aw her &s;uddenly appear. Mir|za te&s;tified the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e at perceiving the Prince. She would have fled, but was withheld by Philamir. Ah, my Lord! &s;aid &s;he, I thought you had already quitted the Ca&s;tle, and I came again to &s;ee this place &s;o dear to me.</P>
<P>You got my line then?</P>
<P>I did not, my lord; what line?</P>
<P>The Prince was vexed to think he owed the happine&s;s of &s;eeing her again to chance alone. Every thing that gratitude or ten|derne&s;s could in&s;pire the Prince uttered. Mirza wept, and di&s;covered &s;entiments &s;o heroic, and at the &s;ame time &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate, that the Prince fell enraptured on his knees, and could only expre&s;s his admiration by his tears. The Prince ju&s;t at this moment hearing the leaves ru&s;tle, turned his head, but what was his a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;tre&s;s when Zeolide appeared?</P>
<P>Zeolide, &s;truck dumb with amazement, &s;tood &s;ilent; the confu&s;ed Philamir dur&s;t not &s;peak. At length Mirza, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf
<PB N="135" REF="028733_0133_0FDBE8989AD49760">
to the Prince&s;s, related her whole &s;tory. You &s;ee, madam, added &s;he, I have no|thing to reproach my&s;elf with. I do not fear, that even my Rival &s;hould read my mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts; and I not only do not hate you, but have a lively &s;en&s;ation of what your feelings mu&s;t this moment be. I &s;uf|fer as much from your woes as from my own. Philamir regrets me, this cannot be denied; but it is you he loves, and were he to attempt to break his engagement to you, I would oppo&s;e his intentions. I am about to quit, and never &s;ee him more. The effort will co&s;t me my life, but to my love duty is &s;uperior.</P>
<P>Can it be, cried Zeolide, that a pa&s;&s;ion which rea&s;on cannot approve, may become thus violent in a heart like your's?&mdash;A|dieu, Philamir, continued the Prince&s;s, I re&s;tore you your freedom, and at length re|gain my own; but renouncing you, I re|nounce the married &s;tate.&mdash;Be happy, and farewel.</P>
<P>Stay, Prince&s;s, cried the di&s;tracted Phila|mir.</P>
<P>Begone, my Lord, &s;aid Mirza, with langui&s;hing voice, go recover your mi&s;tre&s;s and abandon the wretched Mirza! She no

longer loves, I adore&mdash;O! that with my heart I could re&s;tore you her, &s;ince without her life is a burden.</P>
<P>How exalted a &s;oul! Yes, Mirza, you de&s;erve happine&s;s! Yet Zeolide!&mdash;I can|not determine my own feelings.</P>
<P>Cruel Prince! do you doubt between a woman who abandons you, and the unfor|tunate affectionate Mirza.&mdash;Should you, now hope has entered my heart, &s;hould you now abandon me, you will behold me expire.&mdash;Yet what do I &s;ay? Heavens! I am di&s;tracted!&mdash;Alas! I cannot in this place hide my tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>Let me away, you &s;hall not leave me, nor &s;hall the be&s;t of her &s;ex be by me devoted to death.</P>
<P>What is this I hear! cried Mirza. Is life yet in view?&mdash;And will you love me?</P>
<P>Philamir could not an&s;wer for his tears&mdash; away then, dear Prince, &s;top not a mo|ment. Fly from this Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he tran&s;ported, pulled the Prince along with her, who &s;hed a torrent of tears. They approached the fatal gates of the Ca&s;tle, when they were &s;uddenly met by the venerable Gelanor: Mirza &s;hudder|ed
<PB N="137" REF="028733_0135_0FDBE89A5BC24AF0">
&mdash;Fly, Prince, fly this old man, &s;aid &s;he; hear him not!</P>
<P>Stop, cried Gelanor; you cannot fly&mdash; The gates are &s;hut.</P>
<P>Mirza, at the&s;e terrible words, turned pale, her trembling legs &s;carcely could &s;up|port her&mdash;Gelanor approached, and &s;eiz|ing her by the arm&mdash;Perfidious woman, &s;aid he, return <HI>the Tali&s;man,</HI> or I will in|&s;tantly deliver you to the vengeance of Pha|nor! Mirza did not he&s;itate a moment, but taking the <HI>box of cry&s;tal</HI> from her pocket gave it to Gelanor, who, turning towards Philamir, &s;aid, Now li&s;ten to that woman, for whom you have &s;acrificed Zeolide; &s;peak, Mirza, &s;peak, I enjoin you, cried Gelanor.</P>
<P>If it mu&s;t be &s;o, &s;aid Mirza, I had but the ma&s;k of virtue; ambition and vanity a|lone, in&s;pired me with a de&s;ire to &s;educe this credulous and &s;illy Prince.</P>
<P>Begone, &s;aid the Philo&s;opher, you have &s;aid enough.</P>
<P>She immediately withdrew&punc; and the Prince, rai&s;ing his eyes and hands to Hea|ven, exclaimed, Wretch that I am! What have I done? Oh Zeolide?&mdash;Yet how could
<PB N="138" REF="028733_0136_0FDBE8742A55EFB8">
I conceive &s;uch &s;entiments and &s;o &s;eemingly &s;incere a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Do you know how that happened?&mdash; Pride&mdash;With a little le&s;s vanity you would have thought, however dangerous love may be, it is not a di&s;ea&s;e of which people die; you would have known, that not even com|pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould obliterate a promi&s;e &s;o &s;acred.</P>
<P>O my Gelanor! What &s;hall I do! become my Mentor and Protector.</P>
<P>You are not yet hopele&s;s; the Genius is informed of every thing, and is this in&s;tant endeavouring to prevail on the Prince&s;s to grant you a generous pardon; he will come to &s;eek you, when your appearance will be proper.</P>
<P>In the mean time, &s;aid the Prince, tell me how this Tali&s;man, which Phanor gave to the beauteous Agelia, could come into the artful Mirza's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was &s;hortly thus, replied Gelanor&mdash; When Agelia quitted the Ca&s;tle, as &s;he came to the gate, &s;he took this precious box from Nadir, and gave it me. Gelanor, &s;aid &s;he, I give you this Tali&s;man, on condition you never return it to Phanor; and that you lend it to women, as often as by this means you can pre&s;erve them from any great peril.
<PB N="131" REF="028733_0137_0FDBE89C1931C4A0">
Be you, henceforth the protector of the weaker &s;ex, in this dangerous Ca&s;tle; and though you mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e the guilty, yet grant them your pity and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The amiable Agelia thus &s;poke, I received the Tali&s;man, and, conformable to her be|nevolent intentions, have, for the&s;e eigh|teen years, pre&s;erved many wives from the wrath and re&s;entment of their hu&s;bands. I &s;ent them the Tali&s;man, and they had too much intere&s;t to keep the &s;ecret, for me to fear the lea&s;t indi&s;cretion on their parts; each woman, with whom the box has been de|po&s;ited, returned it at departing; and to this day the &s;ecret has never been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>It is about four months ago, as I was walking in the gardens, I perceived a beauti|ful lady weeping. This lady was Mirza; who told me &s;he had arrived that morning, and learnt, by chance, the virtue of the Ca&s;tle. I have a hu&s;band, added &s;he, in a con&s;umption; he has but a &s;hort time to live; I have made him happy but have de|ceived him; &s;hould he interrogate me, his la&s;t moments will become dreadfully mi&s;era|ble, e're he dies he may take &s;ome method to be revenged.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="028733_0138_0FDBE875A5394430">Mirza got the Tali&s;man from me, and calmed her fears; and her hu&s;band, about a month afterwards expired in her arms, ble&s;&s;ing heaven for having given him the mo&s;t virtuous of women for a wife. Mirza, be|come a widow, conjured me to leave the Tali&s;man in her hands till &s;he departed, that &s;he might pre&s;erve her reputation, which an indi&s;creet que&s;tion in the Ca&s;tle might de|prive her of, when this precious Tali&s;man was taken from her.</P>
<P>She appeared fond of me; &s;he was amia|ble and witty, and her company was not without its charms. I felt, however, how dangerous &s;he might be to others, &s;ince with &s;o much wit and beauty, &s;he alone had the power of di&s;&s;imulation. I therefore required &s;he &s;hould live in retirement; and when you arrived, I ordered her to avoid you. Her &s;ecret was in my keeping, and &s;he found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>I became di&s;tre&s;t, and &s;he, under pre|text of nur&s;ing me, prolonged her &s;tay. I &s;aw ye&s;terday &s;he was agitated, and had my &s;u&s;picions, but &s;aid nothing. The Phy&s;ician had ordered me to keep my room a few days longer, which Mirza knew; but this morn|ing I wi&s;hed to &s;ee the Prince&s;s before &s;he
<PB N="141" REF="028733_0139_0FDBE89D5C25E308">
went, who related to me the heroic &s;cene which ju&s;t had pa&s;&s;ed, I in&s;tantly &s;ought for Phanor; he ordered the gates of the Ca&s;tle to be &s;hut; and as the Prince&s;s was ignor|ant of Mirza's perfidy, we agreed not to mention the Tali&s;man to her; that you, my Lord, if &s;o you plea&s;e, may avail your&s;elf of its virtues to re-e&s;tabli&s;h your&s;elf in the love of Zeolide.</P>
<P>Gelanor then gave Philamir the cry&s;tal box; and at the &s;ame moment a &s;lave came from Phanor to &s;eek Philamir, who, full of trouble and di&s;tre&s;s, ran to the chamber of the Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Whenever he &s;aw her, he ran, flung him|&s;elf at her feet, di&s;covered the deceit of Mir|za, and &s;hewed her the Tali&s;man which he had laid upon the table; by hiding this &s;to|ry, and keeping that Tali&s;man, &s;aid he, I might have per&s;uaded you I did not go with Mirza, and had re&s;i&s;ted all her &s;eductions; but though I cannot lo&s;e you without the lo&s;s of happine&s;s, I would prefer even that to deceit. Yes, Zeolide, I was &s;educed, in|veigled; I no longer have the &s;ame blind and impetuous pa&s;&s;ion, which I felt before our arrival in this fatal Ca&s;tle; but I love you, as I &s;hall for ever love you; without
<PB N="142" REF="028733_0140_0FDBE87B30AD6148">
