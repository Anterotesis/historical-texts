<HEAD>DOCTRINE. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t walks in the mid&s;t of his Churches, which are com|pared to Golden Candle&s;ticks.</HEAD>
<P>Here are three PROPOSITIONS. viz. 1. <HI>The Churches of Chri&s;t are com|pared to Candle&s;ticks.</HI> 2. <HI>To Candle|&s;ticks of Gold.</HI> 3. <HI>The Lord Je&s;us walks in the mid&s;t of them.</HI></P>
<P>Prop. 1. <HI>The Churches of Chri&s;t are compared to Candle&s;ticks.</HI> Their being compared to <HI>Candle&s;ticks,</HI> may proba|bly be in allu&s;ion to the Seven <HI>Lamps</HI> or <HI>Lights,</HI> that were in the <HI>Golden Candle|&s;tick</HI> in the Tabernacle of old. That Golden Candle&s;tick had <HI>&s;even Lamps to give light,</HI> Exod. 25.37. Numb. 8.2. The Churches of Chri&s;t may be compared to Candle&s;ticks.</P>

to <HI>receive Light,</HI> to <HI>receive</HI> a lighted Candle that is put into it: it has no light but what it receives. So all the true Churches, the true Followers of Chri&s;t, they <HI>receive light</HI> from him. As future Glory is called the Inheritance of the <HI>Saints in light,</HI> (Col. 1.12.) So the Saints them&s;elves while here on Earth, are called the <HI>Children of light</HI>; they are inlightened ones. 1 The&s;. 5.5. <HI>Ye are all the children of the light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkne&s;s.</HI> And from whence have the Saints and Churches of Chri&s;t their <HI>light,</HI> their knowledge and under&s;tanding in Spiritual Divine Things? Why, they have it from Chri&s;t him&s;elf! He is <HI>the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh in|to the world,</HI> Joh. 1.9.

Surely it behoves you, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the&s;e things between God &amp; your own Con&s;ciences; and &s;o far as you find you have done ami&s;s in any thing, you ought deeply to humble your &s;elves before God for it; yea, on this Occa&s;ion of coming into a new Hou&s;e, and &s;etting up a New Congregation; it is very proper that you &s;hould as thorowly as you can, &s;earch into your own hearts &amp; ways, through the whole time of your pa&s;t lives; and deeply humble your &s;elves before God for what has been ami&s;s in them.
