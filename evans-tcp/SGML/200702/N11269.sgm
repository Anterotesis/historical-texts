<P>IF we were to credit the complaints of the faction at Bo&s;ton, we mu&s;t think them the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed people in the world; if we were to judge of them from their own behaviour, we mu&s;t believe them the mo&s;t factious and &s;edi|tious &s;ubjects in the univer&s;e. They and their Agents loud|ly declare, that they are a PACEABLE PIOUS and LOYAL people: but their tran&s;actions impre&s;s upon us no other idea than that of a people in an open &s;tate of rebellion. The prai&s;e with which they bedaub them&s;elves is, undoubtedly, a &s;trong proof of their mode&s;ty; and the outrageous abu&s;e they throw out again&s;t Government, is a &s;tricking in&s;tance of their good temper, good &s;en&s;e, and moderation. It &s;ure|ly cannot be deemed unfair or unju&s;t to compare their pro|fe&s;&s;ions and their actions together: By their PROFESSIONS we &s;hall be able to determine what &s;ort of folks they would wi&s;h us to believe them to be; by their ACTIONS we &s;hall be convinced what kind of people they really are.</P>
<P>The Bo&s;ton Faction, or more properly Doctor Franklin's Faction at Bo&s;ton, have profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be of a PACE|ABLE and QUIET SPIRIT, and to act always according to Law. As a proof of this declaration, they pulled down and plundered the Lieutenant Governor's hou&s;e, broke open the Secretary's hou&s;e, and demoli&s;hed the Stamp and Admiralty Offices. Notwith&s;tanding this evidence again&s;t them, they &s;till averred that they were influenced &s;olely by the &s;pirit of Law, and the &s;pirit of Meekne&s;s, and that all the mi&s;chief committed among&s;t them was done by Boys and Negroes. A COURTIER is proverbial with us for promi&s;ing to do a favour, and not performing it&punc; but a BOSTONIAN quite

eclip&s;es him, he will do you a capital injury, before your face, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hen grave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y deny it.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now give an example of Bo&s;tonian PIETY. Bo&s;ton Smugglers are far above lurking on the coa&s;t, and running their goods clande&s;tinely. Under the cheri&s;hing wings of the Faction, they boldly pu&s;h along-&s;ide the wharfs, walk deliberately to the Cu&s;tom hou&s;e. TAKE THE NECES|SARY OATHS with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure and unlade their cargoes: If any Officers of the Revenue attempt to inter|fere, the whole Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, Collectors&punc; Comp|trollers, and In&s;pectors, all are knocked down, or driven put of town. Upon this they affirm, that as the&s;e Officers have abdicated, as they call i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, they have no right to re|turn; and that all their bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed to be to di&s;turb the peace and quiet of the town. The pious Bo&s;tonian derives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is right of cheating the Revenue, and of perjuring him|&s;elf, from the example of his fathers and the rights of nature.</P>
<P>As to their loyalty their continued oppo&s;ition to acts of Parliament afford full conviction of it. Be&s;ides, when troops were &s;ent to protect the King's Officers in the execution of the Laws, they publi&s;hed and di&s;per&s;ed over a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l America &s;uch blu&s;tering re&s;olves, that people, WHO DID NOT KNOW THEM, believed when the troops arrived a dreadful carnage would en&s;ue; but the&s;e people &s;oon found they had form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d a very erroneous opinion; the tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ps landed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anne,</HI> 1768.</NOTE> without the lea&s;t ob&s;truction, to the amazement of the Southern Colo|nies, who &s;aid, that as BOSTON WAS TAKEN without any re&s;i&s;tance, they had be&s;t be quiet too.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of the de&s;perate oppo&s;ition they had &s;o often threatened, they had recour&s;e to the WAR OF WORDS; in News-Papers, under the direction of the Faction, the Of|ficers and Soldiers were reviled in the mo&s;t oppr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">brious language; it was &s;aid they were only &s;ent to vex and har|ra&s;s them, and to contaminate their morals. The Officers laughed at all the abu&s;e thrown out again&s;t them, and kept the troops quiet. This good order di&s;appointed the Facti|on; they wanted to excite the Soldiers to &s;ome outrage, in order to around a pretence for their removal. Finding rail|ing ineffectual, they proceeded to per&s;onal in&s;ults and per|&s;onal attack; when an Officer or Soldier was met with at night, he &s;eldom e&s;caped without very barbarous treatment. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> difficult to di&s;cover the offenders, and if di&s;covered, the influence of the Faction pre&s;erved them from puni&s;h|ment. Several in&s;tances of this occurred; when &s;ome of
<PB N="3" REF="014255_0004_0F9358CF63E7E118">
the&s;e Bo&s;ton Rioters were apprehended, numbers of volun|teer witne&s;&s;es offered them&s;elves, and always &s;wore that the Soldiers were the aggre&s;&s;ors From trials of this kind in which they always met with impunity, they advanced to in&s;ults and a&s;&s;ults in open day, urged on by a notion that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">roops would not fire upon them without the orders of a Magi&s;trate; and they all knew, that, let them act ever &s;o outrageou&s;ly no Magi&s;trate would proceed to &s;uch extremi|ty, many of them being of the Faction, and the re&s;t inti|midated by the weakne&s;s of Government. Urged on by this notion, they thought it would be an ea&s;y matter to di&s;arm the Soldiers, and turn them out of town. They began their operations by a concerted attack on the Centinel at the Cu&s;tom&punc;Hou&s;e; the Soldier, when almo&s;t over|powered, made a &s;ignal to the main guard; the Captain of the guard marched with a few men to his re&s;cue; but the Faction continuing the assault with redoubled violence, and &s;ome of the Soldiers being knocked down, and their mu&s;kets nearly wre&s;ted from them, fired, and killed and wounded &s;ome of the Rioters.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of this in&s;urrection was, that the troops were, by &s;ome <HI>very deep &s;cheme</HI> of politics, ordered down to Ca&s;tle I&s;land, and the Laws and Officers of the Revenue left to &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Since the above period, the Faction have kept the town in a continued &s;tate of di&s;order, confu&s;ion, and riot. By a variety of artifices, they have gained the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives. The Council, being cho&s;en by the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives, naturally inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine to the party which gives them exi&s;tence: Be&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">des &s;ome of the Leaders of the Fac|tion, have a &s;trong motive for joining in opp&s;ition to the Laws of trade, they have acquired very large fortunes by ILLEGAL TRAFFIC, and they continue to encrea&s;e them by the &s;ame means: Thus the &s;ub&s;tance of all the writings in their behalf is <Q>Take away the troops, the &s;hips of war, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and put us in our <HI>former &s;ituation of</HI> SMUGGLING without ri&s;k and without pe|nalties, otherwi&s;e we will continue mutinous and rebel|lious.</Q></P>
<P>Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e people would wi&s;h to &s;ee laws in vigour, and reverenced, which would, at once, cut off their immen&s;e gains? The exemption again&s;t taxation, claimed by this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>There are others of the faction pupils of the learned Dr Franklin, who are really mad enough to think of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and total independence on the mother country.

their intere&s;ted de&s;igns. The act lowering the duty on the tea from England, contained in it&s;elf a powerful rea&s;on for their oppo&s;ing it. The bringing tea cheap from Eng|land, would have at once annihilated their exorbitant pro|fits While importation of tea from England was interdic|ted by the Almighty Bo&s;ton Committee, that very con&s;ci|entious Committee &s;old their own &s;muggled &s;tuff at the very moderate profit of <HI>cent per cent.</HI> From this true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, the de&s;truction of the Ea&s;t India Company's tea is not &s;urpri&s;ing. It arrived in a town where the laws had no force, where they were even condemn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d; where the faction had repeatedly declared to all the world that they had de|&s;pi&s;ed England and her Acts of Parliament; in a town from whence they had bani&s;hed his Maje&s;ty's Civil Officers with every mark of contumely; from whence even his Ma|je&s;ty's troops had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with di&s;grace; where no Magi&s;trate dur&s;t appear but on the &s;ide of faction; where tho&s;e who did appear were them&s;elves the faction, abetted by the Repre&s;entatives and the Council. In &s;uch a &s;ituati|on, it is not to be wondered at, that the faction finding them&s;elves omnipotent at Bo&s;ton, committed that daring act of in&s;olence and rebellion.</P>
<P>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l the above enumerated outrages and rebellions, are, what the Faction at Bo&s;ton call ENGLISH LIBERTIES&punc; and which they have often as fooli&s;hly as impudently declared, they would die in defending. But they may ea&s;ily and ef|fectually be re&s;trained and regulated; when they &s;ee and feel, that this country has taken a fixed determination, they will &s;hrink from all but word-of-mouth oppo&s;ition; and that, like all other unfounded clamour, will &s;oon expire of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But this good and much wi&s;hed for end will not be ob|tained, till the laws and acts of trade, which have been &s;o often violated and trampled upon, are &s;upported with vi|gour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">are rendered re&s;pectable, and have a real operation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the conduct and claims of the NEW ENGLANDERS, they appear the mo&s;t rea&s;onable, moderate, and mode&s;t of &s;ubjects. They have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;played the lea&s;t irregularity in their behaviour, nor the lea&s;t arrogance in their claims; their actions are all forcibly marked with gratitude, affection, and loyalty. Their Agents and Writers al&s;o &s;upport their intere&s;t here, with the mo&s;t engaging candour and politene&s;s, with the &s;tricte&s;t truth and ju&s;tice No per&s;on that has eyes to &s;ee, ears to hear, or has learned to read, can doubt this, for they have a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">red us of it them&s;elves</P>
<P>Can there be a greater proof of their openne&s;s and candour than their telling us &s;o often, that they owe us FIVE MIL|LIONS and that they will not pay us till we have humbly &s;ubmitted to all their demands? Can there be a &s;tronger example of their mode&s;ty, than their &s;aying, that we have always been obliged to them, but they never were &s;o to us?</P>
<P>I think at the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t peace, we found our|&s;elves loaded with an enormous debt of <HI>One Hundred and Forty Millions;</HI> one half of which we contracted in protect|ing and defending America&punc; and now to pay the intere&s;t of it, we all are, from Beggars to Peers annually taxed Yet they po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert, that they have always been at the charge of their own e&s;tabli&s;hments, and that they have al|ways protected and defended them&s;elves and that we never were at any expence on their account And all this we mu&s;t &s;wallow without a wry face, upon their &s;ingle <HI>ip&s;e dixit,</HI> o|therwi&s;e their GREAT MEN, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">heir GREAT WRITERS, will abu&s;e us in all the News Paper.</P>
<P>Their fathers went to America, which they &s;ay, is out of the juri&s;diction of England, therefore they are a free and a &s;eparate &s;tate, and not under the contron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of our legi&s;lature. And we mu&s;t not deny this, el&s;e they will <HI>call in the aid of
<PB N="6" REF="014255_0007_0F9358D2854EFA70">
&s;ome fereign State</HI> to reduce us to rea&s;on. If any per&s;on had &s;aid &s;o much of them, he would have gained no credit with the world: but it is <HI>one of their own</HI> PUBLIC RESOLVES which they printed and publi&s;hed them&s;elves, and which they have puffed off and circulated over all America.</P>
<P>Their doctrine is both ingenious and convincing. We have their leave to expend our blood and trea&s;ure, to tax, and to ruin our&s;elves for their protection and defence; but they are neither bound in gratitude to thank us, nor in ho|nour or hone&s;ty to contribute a &s;ingle &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing to relieve our nece&s;&s;ities or to pay for their own government.</P>
<P>They too have found out a NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS. A Mr. Rome goes over to America to collect &pound;50 000 ow|ing his Hou&s;e in London. The Judges there, in league with the debtors, render his errand abortive. He complains of this in a letter to a friend. This letter is &s;tolon by SOME|BODY and tran&s;mitted to America. A printed copy of it is produced in Court again&s;t him, and the debtors impri&s;on their CREDITOR for daring to complain of their collu&s;ive de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">quenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Another Hou&s;e in London &s;ent him powers to demand &pound;.26 000 of debts long due to them; but when he con&s;ulted his lawyer, he received the following &s;hort advice, <Q>Not to put him&s;elf to any expence, until Parliament had made a proper alteration in their government.</Q> Will not this convince the Engli&s;h merchant, that the American Judges &s;hould be rendered independent of the people? and the mer|chants of London would have done a much wi&s;er act four years ago&punc; if in&s;tead of petitioning parliament to take off <HI>A|merican Taxes,</HI> they had implored Parliament to REFORM AMERICAN CHARTERS.</P>
<P>The late bankruptcy of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable American Hou&s;es in Bri&s;tol, and perhaps in England, is the melancholy effects of American out&s;tanding debts.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h merchants have but dreary pre&s;pects from the other &s;ide of the Atlantic; they know that every ve&s;&s;el from that quarter brings a renewal of di&s;appointments, and a re|newal of promi&s;es, which latter never will be fulfilled Their ca&s;e is affecting but it was not unfore&s;een nor unforetold; &s;everal years ago they were warned publicly and repeatedly of the ruinous &s;tate of American credit. They were told; that the MILLIONS which this generous kingdom lavi&s;hed la&s;t war on the wilds of America, had rai&s;ed pedlars and ploughmen to the rank of merchants; that this &s;udden in|flux of wealth had turned the heads of the&s;e dunghill traders;
<PB N="7" REF="014255_0008_0F9358D3170D8CE0">
that a few years of peace had reduced the&s;e mu&s;hroom mer|chants to their primitive in&s;ignificancy; that the Americans were over &s;tocked with Engli&s;h goods; that the Engli&s;h merchants might be convinced of it from looking into their public prints, from the daily auctions adverti&s;ed in every quarter of every great town on that continent; that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who now traded on credit were either fa&s;t declining, or raw &s;triplings ju&s;t out of their apprentice&s;hip; that Ameri|can commerce, which had overflowed &s;o exten&s;ively, was now reverting fa&s;t back to the more contracted channel in which it had glided before the war; therefore that the Eng|li&s;h merchants &s;hould be cautious who they credited. But experience is the be&s;t teacher. And sorry I am to &s;ay it, that the banks of the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi will be cultivated at the expence of the Engli&s;h merchants, and with the pro|duce of unpaid Engli&s;h goods.</P>
<P>What an unhappy delu&s;ion have we laboured under for near two centuries! How many millions have we &s;pent in the cau&s;e of an ungrateful people! And has not the blood of our brav|e&s;t men &s;treamed through all their continent, from the icy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Canada, to the burning &s;ands of Florida? Can an Engli&s;hman forget the carnage of his brave countrymen on the banks of the Mononghahela, before the intrenchments of Ticonderoga, or the lo&s;s of the gallant Wolfe on the plains of Abraham, that day of triumph and mourning, when the rugged &s;oldier wept amid&s;t his conque&s;ts? No, he will never forget them; neither, while memory la&s;ts, will he forget American gratitude!</P>
<P>Thus the Pelican tears her brea&s;t for the &s;upport of her young; they grow vigorous, and fatten on her blood: when &s;he is exhau&s;ted, away they fly; and &s;he is left to expire.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE following is an account of the late and pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Town of Bo&s;ton, I beg that you will give it a place in your paper on Monday. (7<HI>th March</HI> 1774) It will appear on that day with peculiar propriety, the Ame|rican papers being then to be laid before the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.</P>
<Q><P>IF it is true, that people are never in a more de&s;perate &s;tate than when they are left to their own devices, we are gone pa&s;t recovery. The &s;ituation we have been in for the&s;e nine years pa&s;t has been truly deplorable; the lovers

of peace and good order have been for years groaning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|der a wor&s;e than Egyptian bondage; it is even un&s;afe to be neutral. One mu&s;t either take an active part in all the rebellious meetings and actions of the faction, or at lea&s;t &s;eem to countenance them, otherwi&s;e he is branded as an enemy to the country, and his effects, per&s;on, and family, in danger of being &s;acrificed. Indeed the mo&s;t loyal of us are convinced, by what we have already &s;een, and by the ri&s;k, we have already run, that it is better for us &s;eem|ingly to coincide with the faction, than to be tarred and feathered, to have our hou&s;es pulled down, our goods plundered, and our&s;elves and our families totally ruined. This terrifying &s;ituation has ari&s;en from parliament taking up our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eriou&s;ly, and then dropping them after a few ineffectual re&s;olves.</P>
<P>It is to be &s;ure time for us to be quiet; for after &s;eeing the factious &s;mugglers &s;urpri&s;e and burn his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips, de&s;troy the Ea&s;t India Tea, and not only deny, but op|po&s;e the authority of parliament with impunity, we have no choice left.</P>
<P>I am lo&s;t in amazement, and can hardly form a rational conjecture, why parliament &s;hould overlook &s;o many fla|grant in&s;urrections. Here it has had a very unhappy ef|fect: we are pre&s;umptuous, becau&s;e we think we are &s;afe. The inattention of parliament has made the faction arro|gant and in&s;olent beyond all bounds. The recent de&s;truc|tion of the tea may convince all the world of it; and yet according to cu&s;tom, after the commi&s;&s;ion of any mi&s;chief, they are now dreadfully frightened. But I make no doubt they will receive the u&s;ual comforting letters from their agents in London, that their friends are increa&s;ing, and that they have nothing to fear from the mini&s;try or the parliament. Indeed if parliament allows us to go on as we have done for &s;ome years pa&s;t, his Maje&s;ty will not have one real &s;ubject in the&s;e colonies, for the faction will force every per&s;on to join and act with them, and what is &s;trange, I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e pre&s;&s;ed men become more violent and turbulent than the veterans of the faction.</P>
<P>The Moderator of one of the Town meetings about the time the tea was de&s;troyed, was called a Tory &s;ome years ago, and in &s;uch di&s;repute with the faction, that when his hou&s;e was on fire, the Liberty Boys &s;wore that he and it might burn together, if it was not for the danger the re&s;t of the town would be in.

In &s;hort, a per&s;on who inli&s;ts with the faction, though formerly a Tory, a knave, or an Athei&s;t, in&s;tantly becomes a Whig, an Ho|ne&s;t Man, and a Saint. Faction here, as well as with you in London, covers all &s;ins. One of our mo&s;t bawling de|magogues and voluminus writers is a crazy Doctor, whom &s;ome years ago they were going to bani&s;h out of Town for profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf an Athie&s;t.</P>
<P>But the principle man among&s;t them was once our Tax Gatherer, and &s;pent about two thou&s;and pounds lawful money belonging to the Town; but he was forgiven this and made repre&s;entative, and clerk to the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives, on account of his &s;editious writings. Ano|ther great patriot not long ago brought milk into Town to sell. From the&s;e &s;pecimens you may judge what un|principled fellows and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mighty men our patriots are. It is true the &s;mugglers are the main body, but they gene|rally keep out of &s;ight, and pre&s;ent &s;uch men as the above to execute their re&s;olves.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that their Agents &s;hould write &s;uch accounts from London as they know will be agreeable, without regarding the conformity of them to truth, be|cau&s;e they are paid for it. But that &s;uch a man as Pow|nall, one who was &s;o univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed and ridiculed while our Governor, &s;hould contribute his mite to keep up the fire of rebellion, is to me incomprehen&s;ible. It is conjectured here that he wants to come out again Gover|nor, but if they were weak enough to appoint him at home, he would find little comfort or ca&s;e here, whate|ver his vanity may induce him to think. Our Faction on|ly makes a tool of him, and whatever encouragement their letters may give him he would be thoroughly mor|tified to hear the fooli&s;h dirty anecdotes that are given of him here. In the pamphlet inclo&s;ed, intitled <HI>The Hi&s;|tory of Sir Thomas Brazen,</HI> you will find &s;ome account of him. When he was ordered home he prevailed upon the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives (who then were ready enough to vote what did not belong to them) to compliment him with the Province &s;hip of war to carry him to England, but the body of Merchants to whom the ve&s;&s;el belonged.

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Americans and their advocates would wi&s;h to per|&s;wade the people of England that they are not under the controul of Parliament, nor bound in duty to obey its Acts. Under the &s;pecious pretext of combating again&s;t &s;la|very, a pretext which has a &s;ingular effect on Engli&s;hmen, they imagine we will always continue blind to our own inte|re&s;t and to their in&s;idious de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons they give to prove them&s;elves an independent people, are founded on the mo&s;t extravagant and impudent ab&s;urdities. According to them, <Q>the Laws of England do not reach America.</Q> This extraordinary doctrine &s;carce|ly needs a refutation; its weakne&s;s and want of &s;olidity is e|vident without inve&s;tigation. An Engli&s;hman leaves Eng|land and &s;ettles in North America, a country di&s;covered by an Engli&s;hman, and appertaining to the crown of England, and therefore American logic places him out of the line of our legi&s;lature. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver this &s;eriou&s;ly, is either folly, im|pudence, or madne&s;s. An inhabitant of Middle&s;ex by mov|ing to the I&s;le of Man or the i&s;lands of Scilly might, with as good authority, declare him&s;elf out of the dominions of England.</P>
<P>But let us grant them their a&s;&s;ertion: If Americans are not of this kingdom, why do they claim the priviledges of Engli&s;hmen? why do they claim the protection of England? Why have they put this kingdom to the expence of &s;o many MILLIONS to defend them? But I &s;uppo&s;e, when they re&s;orted to this defence again&s;t taxation it was the fir&s;t that occurred to them, and they did not reflect on the objections
<PB N="11" REF="014255_0012_0F9358D78115D500">
that might be rai&s;ed again&s;t it; and they al&s;o &s;urely forgot that old maxim of Law, Rea&s;on, and Ju&s;tice, quoted by their own dearly beloved Farmer, the celebrated Mr Dick|in&s;on, one of their greate&s;t Champions,
<Q><L><HI>Qui &s;entit commodum, &s;entire debet et onus.</HI></L>
<L>They who feel the benefit, ought to feel the burthen.</L></Q></P>
<P>Driven from one idle appeal, they are accu&s;tomed to &s;et up another; they &s;ay <Q>they cannot be legally taxed by the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, becau&s;e they are not repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h Parliament; for that taxation and repre&s;entation cannot be &s;eparated</Q> This has been often refuted The large manufacturing towns of Manche&s;ter, Brimigham, Shef|field, and the millions of people in the kingdom who have no votes in the election of members, are unan&s;werable argu|ments again&s;t this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Their next &s;illy defence is, <Q>that Government ought to make a requi&s;ition of a &s;tipulated &s;um, and their A&s;&s;em|blies would grant it if they were able and thought it ex|pedient.</Q></P>
<P>As to their ability, we know and have &s;een the common porters in that country, living, as to all kinds of provi&s;ions, much more luxuriou&s;ly than the fir&s;t merchants here; and as to the higher orders among them, they enjoy the pre&s;ent moment, leaving futurity to care for it&s;elf. Their having large families does not furni&s;h them with reflection; they &s;wim along thoughtle&s;s, with the tide of fa&s;hion, in profu&s;i|on and gaiety, abandoning their offspring to providence and the fertility of the &s;oil. This is the rea&s;on that &s;o many of them die in&s;olvent, and that &s;o many heavy debts remain un|paid to the Engli&s;h merchants. Now if taxes were rai&s;ed a|mong them equivalent to their incomes in trade, it would have the happy effect of rendering them more punctual, at|tentive, and indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>As to expediency, it has been tried, and they did not think it even expedient to &s;end us an an&s;wer. Though the circum&s;tance of the Mother Country applying to all her dif|ferent petty colonies is rather humiliating and di&s;graceful, yet even this has been done. The re&s;ult is too well known to be denied. The Colony Agents were acquainted by Mr. Greenville, <Q>that a revenue would be required from them to defray the expences of their protection</Q> The Hou&s;e of Commons to forward this ju&s;t and rea&s;onable mea&s;ure, re|&s;olved, "That a &s;tamp duty might be nece&s;&s;ary." Mr. Greenville earne&s;tly recommended to the Colonies the mak|ing grants by their own a&s;&s;emblies; or if they di&s;liked &s;tamp
<PB N="12" REF="014255_0013_0F9358D9712B2880">
duties, to propo&s;e any other effectual made of rai&s;ing money, and carry it into execution them&s;elves; but all in vain. The Colonies rai&s;ed no fund among them&s;elves, they made no of|fer, no grant, nor laid any tax. Parliament therefore pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tamp act next year.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the altercations and complaints concern|ing this act, the Americans held forth upon every occa&s;ion, the doctrine, <Q>that repre&s;entation and taxation &s;hould ac|company each other:</Q> Upon this &s;everal hints were gi|ven, that even on that ground any propo&s;als would be &s;eri|ou&s;ly and candidly attended to. Then they flew from their own clamourous exception, and &s;hamefully declared, <Q>that their local &s;ituation effectually debarred them from a re|pre&s;entation in the Briti&s;h Parliament;</Q> and their facti|ous adherents, both at home and abroad, mo&s;t vociferou&s;ly and violently declaimed again&s;t the ab&s;urdity of the idea, though they them&s;elves were the very fir&s;t people that &s;ug|ge&s;ted and enforced that idea.</P>
<P>To pur&s;ue them through all their incoherences, contra|dictions, tergiver&s;ations, and complaints, is mere children's play. Their fir&s;t declaration is, that they are not Engli&s;h &s;ubjects; when this is di&s;proved, then they agree that they are Engli&s;h &s;ubjects but that they ought not to be taxed. When it is urged, why do they claim the benefit and reject the burthen? Becau&s;e, they &s;ay, they are not repre&s;ented. When repre&s;entation is held forth to them.&mdash;Oh, then their locality is an in&s;uperable hindrance; but when England wants money from them, a requi&s;ition &s;hould be made to their A&s;&s;emblies. A requi&s;ition was made by Mr. Greenville and they did not grant a &s;hilling; and the whole empire was di&s;|turbed and di&s;gu&s;ted with their &s;currilous complaints, their vainglorious threatenings, and their mean o&s;tentatious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">-applau&s;e Like a termagant woman they thought to gain their point, from their ince&s;&s;ant clamour and raving. Indeed &s;o ridiculous are their a&s;&s;ertions and their claims, that a re|futation would not be nece&s;&s;ary, but for the credulity of &s;ome good people, who think that they mu&s;t be aggrieved becau&s;e they complain.</P>
<P>The truth is, the Americans do not doubt either the right or power or ju&s;tice of England in taxing them; they are ful|ly con&s;cious of all the&s;e things in their own minds, and will often confe&s;s them in private, though they deny them in pub|lic. Their aim is, to keep their money and their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e trade, or rather their <HI>illicit trade,</HI> as long as they can, as was can|didly con&s;e&s;t by one of the greate&s;t merchants in New Eng|land.

In reply to this confe&s;&s;ion, their duty and gratitude to the Mother Country, and a regard to their own peace, were urged; but our merchant &s;aid laughingly, they were all very well agreed to keep their money, and to make the mo&s;t of their pre&s;ent advantages in trade, as long as they po&s;&s;ibly could and that they would not &s;ubmit till they were forced; in the mean time &s;ome commotions might ari&s;e in Europe, or &s;ome di&s;turbances in England, or their friends might come into the mini&s;try, either of which would oca&s;i|on the di&s;countenance of the taxation &s;cheme; that there were many chances in their favour, if they &s;trenuou&s;ly per|&s;i&s;ted in oppo&s;ition; but if they once acquie&s;ced, they could never renew the &s;truggle with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate of facts, but more from their own conduct. England may now, after a trial of ten years, be fully con|vinced of the intentions and di&s;po&s;itions of the Americans. They will acknowledge no dependance; they will not admit even the right of taxation; they &s;ay acts of trade hurt their commerce; in &s;hort, they di&s;claim any connection with us. What the final determination of all the&s;e rebellious declara|tions will be, any man of common penetration may fore&s;ee. There ought to be in every government, a &s;ubordination in the &s;ubject, and a reverence for the laws; there ought, in every government, to exi&s;t &s;omewhere a regulating and con|tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ling power, to be employed on all occa&s;ions for the good of the whose empire; one part of the kingdom ought not to be permitted to act independent of, or in direct oppo&s;ition to the laws, while the other part is forced to act in &s;trict confor|mity to them: The refractory Coloni&s;ts mu&s;t therefore be brought back by FORCE within the line of the laws; leni|ent mea&s;ures have been long ineffectually tried, they have only given encouragement to further arrogance and encroach|ment: The Empire, to be &s;ure, will re&s;ound with their pre|tended grievances, their heavy oppre&s;&s;ions, their gro&s;s re|proaches, and their noi&s;y complaints; but as now we all are thoroughly convinced of their hypocri&s;y and turbulence, their &s;editious outcries will have no avail.</P>
<P>Like an unbroken colt when fir&s;t bound in the traces, they will doubtle&s;s be very unruly, and will make many efforts to di&s;engage them&s;elves from their enforced &s;ub&s;erviency to the laws; but as long cu&s;tom is very powerful, and often recon|ciles us to great hard&s;hips, it is to be hoped that, in time, duty to their Sovereign, re&s;pect for the Laws, and affection to the Mother Country, will univer&s;ally prevail among&s;t them.</P>

IT is thought that Dr. Franklin's new Colony Grant has not yet gone through all the nece&s;&s;ary forms of office, and if that is the ea&s;e, and it &s;hould &s;tick in the pa&s;&s;age, &s;o much the better for Britain; we have already more Colonies than we can manage; &s;hould the Grant be cancelled, this art|ful &s;cheme of the Doctor's to accelerate the independency of his beloved country, we hope will never be brought for|ward again. As to this Colony in idea, it is &s;o happily &s;i|tuated as to be totally out of the reach of Britain, and if we &s;hould be &s;o very good natured as to credit our Manufac|tures to people &s;ettled there, it would be hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;end them to this American Paradi&s;e, but at an expence ten times exceeding the original value. Their ab&s;tracted &s;itu|ation in this new world, would nece&s;&s;arily impel them to manufacture for them&s;elves, and they would afford an a&s;ylum for every vagrant and runaway from the other Colonies. Was a man in debt, he might &s;ell off his &s;tock and clam|ber over the American Alps with the money in his pocket, and there he would be nearly as &s;afe from his creditors in England a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> if he was beyond the verge of nature. Great con&s;olation it would be to England to hear by every ve&s;&s;el from America, of the rapid increa&s;e of VANDALIA, from the retreat of your debtors bag and baggage over the al|mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible Allegany Mountains. Was another man inclined, by one capital &s;troke, to make his fortune, all he had to do was to order 10 000<HI>l.</HI> or 20 000<HI>l</HI> worth of goods, and when they arrived from London, &s;ell them off by auction, or any other &s;peedy method, and then troop off to the fertile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Ohio.</P>
<P>It was lately a&s;&s;erted in a morning paper, that his Maje&s;|ty was now fully convinced of Dr. Franklin's innocency. This is only an impudent puff of the Doctor's own compo|&s;ing, his Maje&s;ty has been for years pa&s;t well informed, and fully convinced of the Doctor's &s;editious and traiterous de|&s;igns, and the Doctor him&s;elf knows in his own con&s;cience, (if he is not too much of a philo&s;opher to have one) that his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion and di&s;grace are ju&s;tly merited.</P>

Now let any man &s;itting by his own fire-&s;ide, &s;urounded by his family, read the treatment this unfortunate man met with, and let him conceive him&s;elf in his &s;ituation, and then let him judge what puni&s;hment is due to the mi&s;creants at Bo&s;ton, who u&s;ed him &s;o barbarou&s;ly; and what credit &s;hould be given to their Writers and Agents here, when they tell us "they are an orderly and regular people".</P>
<P>This poor man having retreated to the upper floor of the hou&s;e he had taken &s;helter in, was followed by the mob and &s;eized; a rope was fixed round him, and he was lowered out of the garret window to the riotous multitude below, then &s;tript naked, annointed with tar, covered over with fea|thers, and placed in a cart, in which he was driven through the principal &s;treets of the town, and after that a mile out of town to the gallows, to which he was tied, cruelly beat and whipt. When the man was almo&s;t expiring, it being the middle of the Winter, they carted him back again, and left him in the &s;treet to the mercy of whoever chu&s;ed to take care of him.</P>
<P>This attrocious deed, barbarous as it is, is far from being uncommon at Bo&s;ton. That seditious town has been in the very &s;ame di&s;order for the&s;e la&s;t <HI>ten</HI> years.

<P>So far relative to the MASSACHUSETT's.</P>
<P>The papers written and printed from the other Colonies are exactly of the &s;ame nature. They are the regular of|ficial informations of the different Governors tran&s;mitted to the American Secretary of State, with copies of all the in|flammatory fugitive Papers, Hand Bills, Alarms, Re&s;olves of Town Meetings, and Minutes of Council. In &s;hort, the whole budget of abu&s;e that has been vented again&s;t Parliament and the mini&s;try from New England to the Ca|rolinas, was read to them&s;elves on Saturday la&s;t.</P>
<P>As there was no outrage committed but at Bo&s;ton, it would be &s;uperfluous to narrate all the incendiary &s;cribbling and printing in the different Colonies; it may &s;uffice ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that all the printed bills read were fully larded with the phra&s;es of "de&s;perate plans of de&s;poti&s;m," "mi|ni&s;terial de&s;igns to ruin their Liberties," "Slavery," "galling fetters," "forging infernal chains," "Popery," "de&s;potic rule," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's council appeared in a very Je&s;uitical point of view: They would not give the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance or protection to the <HI>Con&s;ignees,</HI> or to the Ea&s;t India Company's property: They would not even take into con&s;ideration the landing and &s;curing the teas. By their replies it would &s;eem, that they rather <HI>rejoiced</HI> in the oppo&s;ition formed by the faction; and if they did not openly range them&s;elves on its &s;ide, at lea&s;t by their neutrality, and the purport of their

an&s;wer, it was &s;ufficiently evident, that they did not even wi&s;h to interpo&s;e as mediators. The Con&s;ignees <Q>prayed to re&s;ign them&s;elves and the property entru&s;ted to their care, to the council, not only as their guardians and pro|tectors, but al&s;o tho&s;e of the people at large.</Q> But the&s;e worthy gentlemen thought proper to have nothing to do with them; and rather hinted that the tea &s;cheme was calculat|ed to di&s;turb the peace of the town and province.</P>
<P>The letters from the different Governors contain a minute and regular detail of the &s;tate of their different provinces, but particularly of the <HI>Capitals</HI> of each, from the fir&s;t in|telligence of teas being &s;hipped at home, to its arrival in America and return back or de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Above all the re&s;t of the advices, Governor Hutchin&s;on's letters are the mo&s;t preci&s;e, exact, and circum&s;tantial. He endeavoured both to &s;oothe and intimidate the faction. It was he him&s;elf who advi&s;ed the Con&s;ignees to apply to the council for their per&s;onal &s;afety, and &s;ecurity of their pro|perty; for his two elde&s;t &s;ons were two of the Con&s;ignees. He al&s;o, during the height of their turbulent, unlawful and &s;editious a&s;&s;emblings, before the de&s;truction of the tea, &s;ent the &s;heriff to the town meeting at Bo&s;ton, commanding them to break up and depart. When the &s;heriff Mr. Green|leafe arrived in the Hall, and intimated <Q>that he had a paper to read from the Governor,</Q> the faction put it to vote "whether he &s;hould be permitted to read it or not?" After &s;ome debate; permi&s;&s;ion was granted, and the &s;heriff accordingly pronounced the Governor's orders for them to di&s;per&s;e. The in&s;tant he had fini&s;hed, the faction &s;aluted him with an univer&s;al hi&s;s, which continued, and accompa|nied him out of doors. The proclamation was afterwards publi&s;hed in the Gazette from whence it was copied into the other papers, and critici&s;ed and commented upon with eve|ry mark of contempt and indignity. Before the arrival of the tea, the Governor, who is very in&s;inuating, appeared to have taken every mea&s;ure that prudence could &s;ugge&s;t both for the &s;afety of the India property and the &s;afety of the Con&s;ignees. The principal leader of the faction was applied to; he commanded the Governor's Company of Cadets, but it was not to be expected that the leader of the faction would mu&s;ter the Cadets to oppo&s;e his own party and his own plots The applications, of cour&s;e, had no effect.

Mr. Rotch re&s;i&s;ted a long time, but his per&s;on being threatened, nay his life, at la&s;t made him comply.

This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">negociation, or in&s;urrection, or rebellion, came to a cri&s;is about the middle of December. The fac|tion, &s;itting in town-meeting&punc; heard the account of the re|fu&s;als above mentioned, from Mr. Rotch. It appears they expected &s;uch an&s;wers, and were prepared for the event; for immediately after Mr. Rotch's account, &s;ignals were given both from within and without the meeting. A number of men, di&s;gui&s;ed, boarded the ve&s;&s;els containing the tea, and, as it is &s;aid, threw the whole into the &s;ea, though &s;ome un|believers may think that not a little of it might be purloin|ed, and that MADAM THETIS had not &s;o &s;trong a di&s;h of tea that evening as &s;ome people may imagine.</P>
<P>This is a recollected Summary of what was heard with regard to to the facts, as they happened in regular progre&s;|&s;ion. The opinions of the Writers, as far as may be judg|ed from what is expre&s;&s;ed in their letters, now come to be mentioned.</P>
<P>Upon the face of the whole tran&s;action, in every colony where the tea arrived, it is evident that the Governors acted with the utmo&s;t prudence and circum&s;pection. It happened the &s;hip bound for Bo&s;ton was the fir&s;t that reached her de|&s;tined port: Every civil precaution &s;eems to have been tried to pre&s;erve the peace of the town; his Maje&s;ty's Council, the Cadets, and the Militia, were all applied to without effect; the &s;heriff read a proclamation to the factious, com|manding them to di&s;&s;olve their a&s;&s;embly, and this proclama|tion was immediately afterwards in&s;erted in the Gazette: Both the &s;heriff and the proclamation were treated with in|&s;ult. The people of Bo&s;ton &s;eem, on this occa&s;ion, to have been fairly tried; the Governor &s;eems to have taken, from the beginning, a determination not to call either on the Naval or Military Force, then in the Bay and at Ca&s;tle I&s;land. The loyal and peaceable people of that town were
<PB N="19" REF="014255_0020_0F9358E5291B0688">
altogether left to the exerci&s;e of their own judgment, and they have given all the world a notable proof of it, by wantonly de&s;troying a valuable property, when all they had to do was to keep firm in their re&s;olution, not to buy or drink any of it; they will, however, pay for their outrage|ous pa&s;time; they mu&s;t make good the lo&s;s; and they will feel the indemnification the more bitter, as they mu&s;t pay for a commodity which they declare they did not ta&s;te, and which they pretend to abhor.</P>
<P>The other Governors, after the accompli&s;hment of the Bo&s;ton exploit, wi&s;ely agreed to let the tea be carried back, as what had already happened was &s;ufficient to rou&s;e the Engli&s;h nation and parliament; and by this prudent con|duct they put it out of the power of the people under their Government to act in the &s;ame fooli&s;h and frantic manner as the people of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>As to Governor Hutchin&s;on, if it had not been for his re&s;olution not to irritate the people, by calling in the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Navy, the tea would have been &s;aved; but, as the Bo&s;tonians always made great complaints of the inter|po&s;ition of the Navy and Army, and not only declared, but SWORE, they had always begun every di&s;turbance, every rational man will be glad to find that their Governor gave them no &s;uch plea on this occa&s;ion: They were left to their own will and plea&s;ure, and behaved ten times wor&s;e than ever.</P>
<P>It appears, by all the letters from America, that nothing can be done there by Officers, Civil Military, or Naval, to effectuate the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace in that country; they can make no movement, even the mo&s;t trifling, but what is exclaimed again&s;t by the licentious Bo&s;tonians, as an infringment of their Liberties. They have therefore re|mained, for the&s;e la&s;t three years, in total inactivity, &s;ub|mitting to the in&s;ults of faction with the mo&s;t patient en|durance, in hopes that Parliament, by an alteration and regulation of their ab&s;urd Charters, will at lea&s;t relieve them, and all the re&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects in the Colonies.</P>
<P>Governor Hutchin&s;on's &s;ettled opinion is, <Q>that no ef|fort in the Colonies by any body of men civil or military, can remove the evils that now reign among&s;t them. It is Parliament, and Parliament only, which can re&s;tore that turbulent country to peace, and bring order out of confu&s;ion.</Q> And it is &s;aid, that his letters for the&s;e

&s;ix years pa&s;t have uniformly inculcated and held forth the &s;ame doctrine.</P>

<P>IT is a certain fact that all the old American merchants are of late become very cautious whom they credit in Ame|rica Their lo&s;&s;es have taught them wi&s;dom. They have left off that general and indi&s;criminate credit, which they had &s;ome years ago &s;o injudiciou&s;ly plunged into; now they tru&s;t only their old tried cu&s;tomers; and they will not ac|cept of recommendations, even from them, of any new be|ginners, unle&s;s the&s;e recommendations are accompanied with &s;ecurities to the full extent of the credit required. The decrea&s;e of our exports to America has not ari&s;en from their boa&s;tful re&s;olves not to import our goods, but from their di&s;|inclination to pay for what we have already &s;ent them; for the <HI>greate&s;t patriots</HI> are tho&s;e very merchants who are <HI>mo&s;t backward</HI> in their payments. It is a very di&s;agreea|ble circum&s;tance for a capital hou&s;e here to fail for want of remittances from Bo&s;ton, that very patriotic and hone&s;t town; but it is not &s;urprizing that patiots do not pay their debts. Men who dedicate their whole time to the intere&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="014255_0022_0F9358E694DAD630">
of the community, are far above attending to their own private intere&s;t, or to the intere&s;t of their creditors; and an American re&s;olution not to import our goods, always implies a re&s;olution not to pay for tho&s;e they have already import|ed. That a merchant of this city, a man of &s;pirit, know|ledge, acutene&s;s, and indu&s;try, &s;hould be obliged to under|take a voyage to the land of Patrioti&s;m, civilly to a&s;k a great Patriot to pay nine or ten thou&s;and pounds long due to him, is probable enough, and it is al&s;o very probable, that after the utmo&s;t exertion of his ingenuity, and re&s;iding in the town of Bo&s;ton for &s;ome months, that at la&s;t he &s;hould find him&s;elf obliged to return without bringing a &s;ingle farthing of the debt along with him. The debtor at the &s;ame time reputed the riche&s;t man in Bo&s;ton, and al&s;o po&s;i|tively known to be one of the principal leaders of the facti|on, and a notorious detected &s;muggler.</P>
<P>The merchants of England, when they hear of a New England in&s;urrection, li&s;ten to it as they would to any other article of news, never reflecting what a fatal effect American uproars and rebellions may have on their trade. For till that country is brought into &s;ubjection to the laws, their Charters taken away and new modelled, and their Judges, Coun&s;ellors, and Governors appointed by the King neither peace nor loyalty will inhabit Rhode I&s;land, Connecticut, nor Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's, nor will the merchants re&s;iding there pay their debts due here. This is fully exemplified in Rhode I&s;land, where 76, 000<HI>l.</HI> pounds is due only to two hou&s;es in London, and in the three Provinces, at lea&s;t a million more may be added on a moderate computation. The rea&s;on why the debts cannot be recovered, is paticularly &s;tated in the printed letters from America. The Judges are cho&s;en annually by the people; they mu&s;t therefore act in &s;uch a manner as to pre&s;erve the good will of the people, otherwi&s;e at the next election they are turned adrift. Is it to be expec|ted that &s;uch Judges will give judgment in their Courts in favour of an Engli&s;hman, again&s;t their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">electors? If the merchants of England wi&s;h to have a chance for recovering their American debts, let them petition Government for an amendment of American Charters.</P>
<P>As &s;muggling is one of the many cau&s;es of American re|bellion, it would be advi&s;able in Government to &s;tation a number of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els of little draught of water along the coa&s;t of America, on purpo&s;e to make captures of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> traders. This would undoubtedly occa&s;ion heavy com|plaints from that quarter of the interruption and embar|ra&s;&s;ment

<P>IN the days of George the third the Puritans of New Eng|land are exactly the &s;ame people as their forefathers were in the days of Charles the fir&s;t. They are factious and tur|bulent, and ever in oppo&s;ition to legal government.</P>
<P>When their licentious conduct requires reprehen&s;ion or pu|ni&s;hment, then they are the mo&s;t mi&s;repre&s;ented people un|der heaven; and they obte&s;t the whole world to be witne&s;&s;es of their orderly and holy deportment, and of the grievous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vactions and oppre&s;&s;ions of their enemies. This is always the whining cant of hypocri&s;y. They do not expect that people, who are really well acquainted with their mutinous actions and trea&s;onable plots, &s;hould give credit to their own account of them&s;elves, but by their piteous complainings, they think to impo&s;e on the compa&s;&s;ionate, and on that part of the public who are uninformed of their real character.</P>
<P>Unea&s;y and arrogant, they left their native country, under the pretence of enjoying civil and religious liberty. E&s;tabli|&s;hed in America, they per&s;ecuted, bani&s;hed, or hanged all that differed from them in opinion: That liberty which they claimed in England, they denied to others in America; and after having fled from per&s;ecution, they them&s;elves became Per&s;ecutors. In the very fir&s;t year of their &s;ettlement they manife&s;ted their hatred to the religion of their Mother Coun|try; and forcibly bani&s;hed &s;ome of their companions who wi&s;hed to follow and practice the rites of the Church of Eng|land. Impri&s;onment, bani&s;hment, and death, &s;oon rid them of all di&s;turbers and opponents; and the commotions that &s;oon after followed in England, gave them lei&s;ure to model their government on the fulle&s;t principles of INDEPENDENCY.</P>
<P>After the re&s;toration, this generous country afforded them every a&s;&s;i&s;tance; we were proud and plea&s;ed with our grow|ing children; we admired even their independent notions, their turbulent petulance, and their declared oppo&s;ition to our laws. In fact, like over-fond parents we &s;poilt our chil|dren, we our&s;elves encouraged them to rebel again&s;t us, and now we are reaping the fruits of our fooli&s;h indulgence.</P>
<P>The New Englanders plead an exemption from taxation, as if they were not &s;ubjects; and they bring forward their

CHARTER granted by our Kings, as a proof of their in|dependence. The mo&s;t contemptible argument often repeat|ed, makes an impre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome people. The claims of A|merica at one time gained ground in this kingdom, not from their validity, but from the impudence with which they were urged. The generality of people did not know that at fir&s;t the Colony of New England was governed by a Council e|&s;tabli&s;hed at Plymouth; and that the Hud&s;on's B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y Compa|ny, the Ea&s;t India Company, or any other chartered Com|pany, might as well arrogate to them&s;elves an independen|cy on this kingdom, as the vain and blu&s;tering Bo&s;tonians.

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>IT has already been proved from the fir&s;t Charter of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, it&s;elf, that the Colony of New Eng|land was to be governed by a Company e&s;tabli&s;hed at Ply|mouth, in the County of Devon, and that the New England|ers were' to be freed from Taxes for the fir&s;t <HI>Seven</HI> years on|ly:&mdash;This to be &s;ure is a &s;olid foundation on which to build their independency.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t moment of their &s;ettlement they di&s;played their fractious and refractory &s;pirit, as appears by an order of the Lords of Council in 1632. <Q>Whereas his Maje&s;ty hath lately been informed of <HI>great di&s;traction</HI> and <HI>much di&s;order</HI> in the Plantations in the parts of America called NEW ENGLAND.</Q> It al&s;o appears, that in their ear|ly days they were accu&s;tomed to contradict the charges brought again&s;t them, ju&s;t as they do at pre&s;ent, for the or|der &s;ays that "mo&s;t of the things informed were denied:" yet they were allowed to e&s;cape, lea&s;t the &s;ettlement &s;hould be di&s;couraged; <Q>their Lord&s;hips not laying the <HI>faults</HI> or <HI>fancies</HI> of &s;ome <HI>particular men</HI> on the general govern|ment.</Q> The next year, 1633, we find them in the &s;ame di&s;orderly &s;tate, from another order of the King in Council, which mentions, that <Q>&s;uch confu&s;ion and di&s;traction is al|ready
<PB N="24" REF="014255_0025_0F9358E9B96B4B88">
grown there, as be&s;ides the ruin of the Plantation, cannot but highly tend to the ruin both of the Church and the State here.</Q></P>
<P>When they were at peace with the Indians, and were not occupied in railing at the Mother Country, their re&s;tle&s;s in|flammable di&s;po&s;ition &s;hewed it&s;elf in internal commotions. In 1634 they quarrelled with Mr. Winthrop their Governor and their God almighty, <Q>concerning his receipts and di&s;|bur&s;ements for the public;</Q> but he vindicated him&s;elf with great honour, and concluded his defence with <Q>hear|tily ble&s;&s;ing the Lord our God for his gracious acceptance of his &s;ervices for his Church and people, which he e&s;teem|ed an abundant recompence.</Q> They have &s;ince often &s;hewn the &s;ame ingratitude to many of their be&s;t friends.</P>
<P>Searching their hi&s;tory about this period, we find their no|tions of independency openly profe&s;&s;ed. They imagined they had a right to plant Colonies, to e&s;tabli&s;h what order of government they thought proper, and to form a new State as fully to all intents and purpo&s;es as if they had been in a &s;tate of nature: and on that account they &s;tiled them|&s;elves a COMMONWEALTH. They denied the juri&s;dic|tion of England over them, becau&s;e, as they &s;aid they were out of the realm, yet they very <HI>con&s;i&s;tently</HI> claimed an autho|rity over the Colony of Connecticut, becau&s;e the fettlers there had formerly re&s;ided &s;ome time among them, though they were then evidently without the juridiction of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;ets.</P>
<P>The Bo&s;tonians have ince&s;&s;antly pe&s;tered us with their great merit in cultivating the barren wilderne&s;s; but we all know, that we do not owe this to their good will, but to their fears: They would not &s;tay, and face danger along with the men of &s;pirit of their own party at home, but made off to hide them&s;elves in the woods of America. Mr. Cotton their Prophet, immediately after the emigration, when high|ly blamed by his friends in England for de&s;erting them re|plied, that it was the duty of the young and able bodied to run away, if they had opportunity, for that God called only the old and infirm to witne&s;s to the truth unto death.</P>
<P>In 1635 his Maje&s;ty, on account of the factious &s;tate of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, thought proper to grant a Commi&s;&s;ion for re|gulating the Plantations to &s;everal of the principle Officers of State. The&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners were empowered to inflict puni&s;hment on all offenders, eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil. <Q>either by impri&s;onments or other re&s;traints, or by lo&s;s of life or members, the Royal A&s;&s;ent being fir&s;t had and obtained; they were, to new and growing evils and perils to apply
<PB N="25" REF="014255_0026_0F9358EA7A69C410">
remedies, &s;o often as they &s;hould appear to them nece&s;&s;a|ry and expedient: they were to remand all Officers or Go|vernors to England who did not &s;uppre&s;s ALL REBELS; they were to examine the Letters, Patents, or other writ|ings, granted by the King or his predece&s;&s;ors, and if, up|on view thereof, it appeared they had been &s;urreptitiou&s;ly or unduly obtained, or that any of the priviledges or li|berties therein granted were hurtful to the Kingdom, the Crown, or Prerogative, they were to cau&s;e the &s;ame, ac|cording to the laws and cu&s;toms of our realm of England, to be revoked, him to do all other things which &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the whole&s;ome government and protection of the Colonies, and our people therein biding.</Q></P>
<P>It is evident from this Commi&s;&s;ion, that in the mo&s;t early days of our Colonies there were <HI>offenders</HI> and <HI>growing evils,</HI> and that the Letters Patent or Charters granted them were even then &s;u&s;pected to be contrary to the Laws and Cu&s;toms of England: After one hundred and fifty years conviction, it is now &s;urely time to apply the proper remedies; forbear|ance and affection on our part, have hitherto only rou&s;ed, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, pre&s;umption and defiance; and though our Ar|my and Navy may bring the rebellious Bo&s;tonians to &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, yet, till their Charter is vacated, and another given them, more &s;uitable to our Con&s;titution, every other expe|dient will only be temporary.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tigators and promoters of the rebellious Bo&s;toni|ans, after having led them to commit the mo&s;t outrageous exce&s;&s;es, think now by blu&s;tering to ward off merited venge|ance. The Charter of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets with them, is too &s;a|cred to be touched by our legi&s;lature. Before they promul|gated this impudent doctrine, they &s;hould have reflected that &s;ubjects, when they have acted in defiance of all law, ju&s;tly forfeit every priviledge granted them; for certainly per&s;ons who infringe the rights of the community, and by their out|rages endanger its welfare, in&s;tead of favour and protection have nothing to look for but di&s;grace and puni&s;hment. If their Charter as they &s;ay, authori&s;es them to oppo&s;e the power of Parliament, and places them above its juri&s;diction, it mu&s;t immediately occur to every rational man to enquire from whom they received this extraordinary Charter? Why then they tell us they had it from the King. But they &s;hould con&s;ider that the King is only a third part of our legi&s;lature, and that he cannot alienate any part of his dominions with|out the con&s;ent of the whole. If therefore the King has
<PB N="26" REF="014255_0027_0F9358EB15033620">
granted a Charter which militates again&s;t the good of the &s;tate, it is both ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould recall it, and that another &s;hould be given them more conformable to the con&s;titution of his kingdom. That Parliament may ad|dre&s;s his Maje&s;ty on this important occa&s;ion, and that the Attorney General may be directed to bring a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> again&s;t this very &s;urpri&s;ing Bo&s;ton Charter is greatly to be wi&s;hed. The threats of an old factious Agent, who vomits out his venom in the news papers are utterly contemptible; he owes his &s;afety not to his innocence, but to the lenity of our laws.

<P>It is an old cu&s;tom for the mo&s;t depraved characters to take merit to them&s;elves by addre&s;&s;ing the truly re&s;pectable, as if they were the &s;upporters of their opinions. <HI>Rationalis</HI> therefore, or, in other words, the Bo&s;tonian traitor, appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s to Sir George Saville in a late paper.

Let him pull down a hou&s;e, and carry off the furniture, and the very next moment he will a&s;&s;ure you, he is the mo&s;t hone&s;t man in the world; let him, along with the re&s;t of his town&s;men, a&s;&s;emble expre&s;ly for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying the Ea&s;t India Company's Tea, and let him do it before your face, and then he will gravely tell you it was de&s;troyed by a parcel of Mohawks. But if you are re&s;olved to credit the conviction of your own &s;en&s;es, and will not implicitely believe all that he tells you, why then you are a friend to tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, he in&s;tantly votes you an enemy to the rights and liberties of the great town of Bo&s;ton, and if you are not very alert, hoi&s;ts you into his cart of tar and feathers, and drives you to the gallows, at the &s;ame time mo&s;t hypocritically baw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing out, that he is the mo&s;t ill u&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed poor creative in the univer&s;e, though the mo&s;t dutiful and affectionate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubjects</P>
<P>No mini&s;ter ever had before, to the mo&s;t popular mea&s;ure, &s;o unanimou&s;ly and heartily the concurrence of all ranks of people, as Lord North has to the Bill for puni&s;hing the Bo&s;|ton incendiaries. In the Hou&s;e, oppo&s;ition it&s;elf has given up the cau&s;e of the rebels. They are con&s;cious, that if they were in power they would &s;upport government and the &s;u|preme right of Parliament; without doors the people at large are very &s;en&s;ible that the mini&s;ter is &s;upporting their own cau&s;e. They feel the heavy load of debt under which we are all labouring, and at the &s;ame time reflect that it was contracted in the defence of America. In &s;hort, on one &s;ide there are only two or three hired Agents of the Bo&s;tonian rioters, and on the other, Kings, Lords, and Commons, and all the people of England.</P>

<P>But to proceed with the cur&s;ory account of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets:</P>
<P>In 1636. Mr Vane afterwards the famous Sir Henry Vane, was cho&s;en their Governor; for at that time they had the priviledge of electing their own Governors. The&s;e di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied people were greatly plea&s;ed with him at fir&s;t, but they &s;oon manife&s;ted their re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, his Government was only to la&s;t one year; he was a man of their own choice, and yet they were weary of him in &s;ix months. He offered to re&s;ign; the Bo&s;ton Church made objections to his re&s;ignati|on, and &s;ignified them to the Court then &s;itting. Cautious of occa&s;ioning an internal rupture in the Colony, he agreed to pre&s;ide there for the &s;hort remaining time; but &s;ailed for England two months after the expiration of his government.</P>
<P>The jealou&s;y of Mr. Winthrop, their former Governor, and then Deputy Governor, contributed to ha&s;ten his depar|ture. The religious as well as the political doctrines of the&s;e two men very widely differed. Mr. Winthrop was &s;trenu|ous for denying admittance to all Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, who were &s;u&s;pected to differ from them in opinion, and encouraged the mo&s;t factious in their ideas of forming an independent &s;tate. Mr. Vane, on the contrary, very ju&s;tly a&s;&s;erted the right that every Engli&s;h &s;ubject po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of re&s;iding in any part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions, and of moving from any one part of the&s;e dominions to another, as be&s;t &s;uited him, whil&s;t he continued in &s;ubjection to the laws; for that, by pur&s;uing Mr. Winthrop's plan, the Colony would exceed the limits
<PB N="30" REF="014255_0031_0F9358EE1EBA7868">
of his Maje&s;ty's grant, and forfeit the priviledges, govern|ment, and lands, which they challenged to be their own.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons had no effect on tho&s;e &s;tubborn independents; and immediately after his departure for Eng|land, every per&s;on, man or woman, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be of his opinion, were <HI>disfranchi&s;ed, impri&s;oned,</HI> and <HI>ba|ni&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>Finding them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power, they were above giving any rea&s;ons for their de&s;potic exerci&s;e of it; and they even con&s;idered the que&s;tioning their authority as an in&s;uffe|rable in&s;ult. This was &s;trongly examplified in the trial of Mrs. Hutchin&s;on, who held both the religious and political opinions of Mr. Vane: She was examined before the Gover|nor, A&s;&s;i&s;tants and Clergy, and &s;entenced to be bani&s;hed, and impri&s;oned till &s;he could be &s;ent away.</P>
<P>During her trial &s;he urged, <Q>that, as the clergy were her principal accu&s;ers, they ought to give their evidence on oath.</Q> One of the Judges, in reply to her demand, &s;aid, <Q>admit they &s;hould mi&s;take you in your &s;peeches</Q> (for &s;he was tried only for her opinions, among&s;t which tolerati|on in religion was her capital offence) <Q>you would make them to &s;in, if you urge them to &s;wear.</Q> Another of her Judges was very angry with her, for <Q>not believing al the Godly Mini&s;ters without an oath.</Q> The Deputy Gover|nor &s;aid, <Q>he was &s;ure &s;he was deluded by the devil, and that they &s;hould be all &s;ick with fa&s;ting.</Q> And when the Governor pronounced, <Q>The &s;entence of the Court is, that you are bani&s;hed out of our juri&s;diction, as being a woman not fit for our &s;ociety, and are to be impri&s;oned till the Court &s;hall &s;end you away,</Q> &s;he very naturally a&s;ked, <Q>I de&s;ire to know wherefore I am bani&s;hed?</Q> to which the mild &s;agacious Governor replied, <Q><HI>Say no more! the Court knows wherefore, and is &s;atisfied. </HI></Q></P>
<P>She was accordingly bani&s;hed, and retired to the woods out of the juri&s;diction of the&s;e per&s;ecutors, where &s;he and her family, to the amount of &s;ixteen per&s;ons, were murdered by the Indians, except one daughter.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, however, the rebellious Bo&s;tonians proceed in a more &s;ummary way; tho&s;e who deny their independency, and who believe in the &s;upremacy of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, are driven out of their holy and peaceable town, without be|ing called even to town meeting; and if, unfortunately, they &s;hould be &s;low in their retreat, they are &s;eized, &s;tript naked, be&s;meared with tar, &s;tuck all over with feathers, then cart|ed to liberty tree, or to the gallows, and after having under|gone

the ceremony of whipping, according to the Levitic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> law, they have the oath of bani&s;hment admini&s;tered to them.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the Bo&s;tonians have proceeded from bad to wor&s;e; in&s;tead of reforming they have degenerated; the &s;ons far outdo their forefathers in rioting and rebellion; and in&s;tead of a public mock trial, they give a public <HI>Mob Pu|ni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>But to return again to their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>In the year 1637, after the expiration of Mr. Vane's Government, as many people of his way of thinking were expected from England, the general court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's a&s;&s;embled at Bo&s;ton, and pa&s;&s;ed a very extraordinary act. <Q>A penalty was laid on all per&s;ons who &s;hould entertain in their hou&s;es, any &s;tranger who came with an intent to re|&s;ide, or &s;hould allow the u&s;e of any lot or habitation a|bove three weeks, without liberty from one of the &s;tand|ing council or two other a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The penalty on pri|vate per&s;ons was <HI>forty pounds,</HI> and twenty pounds be&s;ides for every month they continued in the offence; and any town which gave or &s;old a lot to &s;uch &s;tranger, was &s;ub|ject to a penalty of one hundred pounds.</Q></P>
<P>Of old the Bo&s;tonian Puritans by this law denied their fellow-&s;ubjects admittance to their &s;anctified di&s;tricts; and in our days, their &s;ons refu&s;e acce&s;s to our goods, and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to our laws. Yet, in the face of this conviction, their advocates have the mode&s;ty to affirm, <Q>that a perfect har|mony always reigned between them and Great Britain, till the errors and innovations of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters.</Q> Can folly or impudence go farther?</P>
<P>That the above recited law might be all powerful, they immediately pa&s;&s;ed another <Q>to puni&s;h any per&s;on by fine, impri&s;onment, or bani&s;hment, who &s;hould defame any court, or any of their &s;entences.</Q> By this act, even <HI>free|dom of &s;peech</HI> was adjudged criminal by the Government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's. This new law drove numbers into volun|tary bani&s;hment; others were formally disfranchi&s;ed, and bani&s;hed by the court. The ruling party, prayed and thank|ed GOD for having rid them of their enemies, and they a&s;&s;ured HI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, that they inflicted puni&s;hment &s;olely <Q><HI> for his honour and glory, and for the firm e&s;tabli&s;hment of his Kingdom.</HI></Q> And to compleat their great <HI>work,</HI> tolerati|on was every where preached again&s;t, as a damnable &s;in in rulers, which, if permitted, would bring down the venge|ance of heaven upon the holy land.</P>
<P>Previous to the above laws the New Englanders earne&s;tly
<PB N="32" REF="014255_0033_0F9358F0D5C96098">
entreated &s;tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gers to come among&s;t them, that is to &s;ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch as had money, and of them they made great advantage. To the&s;e new comers a milk&punc;cow was &s;old at 25% or 30% which enriched the fir&s;t planters; but when the &s;trangers effects were nearly exhau&s;ted, or when any of their leading men grew jealous of their abilities, they were tried for broaching tenets contrary to the Kingdom of GOD in New England, &s;entenced to be bani&s;hed, and their goods were confi&s;cated for the expences of their condemnation, and to keep them alive in pri&s;on till they &s;hould be &s;ent away.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding a very great oppo&s;ition, the new laws, as already mentioned, were pa&s;&s;ed, and violently carried into execution; for the complete e&s;tabli&s;hment of their in|dependent commonwealth weighed more with the majority, than the advantage of the &s;trangers money.</P>
<P>Such laws and practices would be deemed by men of can|did, upright minds, never to have had a being, if they were not upon record. Mr. Vane, in his an&s;wer to Mr. Winthrop, di&s;clo&s;es their iniquitous proceedings; they were not for bani&s;hing any per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they had made the mo&s;t of his effects: "Why," &s;ays he, <Q>&s;hould any in higher place &s;peak in open court? <HI>Let us have their money fir&s;t.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Yet if we chu&s;e to li&s;ten to the clamours of hypocri&s;y and deceit, and to believe them too, there are people who will publicly a&s;&s;ure us, <Q>that the Bo&s;tonians always were, and at this time are, a mild, equitable, Godly, loyal, and humane people; that they never committed any illegal acts, any unju&s;tifiable outrages, any wanton cruelties, any deliberate barbarities; and that all the flagrant and attrocious in&s;urrections and enormities with which they are charged, are merely the vile &s;ugge&s;tions of Satan, and their enemies, who envy and per&s;ecute the poor people of GOD, even in the <HI>howling wilderne&s;s.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's colony to the pre&s;ent times, every information concerning the &s;ettlers there, as well as their own public acts, evince their intention of forming <HI>an independent &s;tate,</HI> and of throwing off their allegiance to this kingdom. In a letter from A|merica, written in the la&s;t century, we are told, <Q>that it was not new di&s;cipline which they aimed at, but Sove|reignty; and that it was accounted perjury and trea&s;on in their general court, to &s;peak of <HI>appeals</HI> to the King.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="014255_0034_0F9358F11F546A90">
It was al&s;o an avowed doctrine of theirs one hundred and forty years ago, <Q>that as their common wealth was found|ed by free con&s;ent, every member thereof was tied to &s;eek out and entertain all means that might conduce to the welfare of the incorporation.</Q> To this it was rationally and judiciou&s;ly replied, <Q>that they ought not to &s;eek out all means that might conduce to the welfare of the in|corporation, but all lawful and due means, according to the Charter they hold from the King.</Q> Such replies as this mightily offended them, and all who owned allegiance to England were fined and bani&s;hed their dominions. In our days we find their offspring holding the &s;ame principles, for every loyal &s;ubject is driven out of their territories.</P>
<P>About the year 1646, a <HI>Que Warranto</HI> was brought a|gain&s;t their Charter, in which all their different illegal and oppre&s;&s;ive acts are enumerated; among&s;t the re&s;t, that of their taking &s;ums of money for admi&s;&s;ion into their compa|ny, and disfranchi&s;ing whom they plea&s;ed and turning them out of the company. This alluded to the members of the church of England, and to tho&s;e who allowed their depen|dence on the Crown and &s;tate of England. How then can the Bo&s;tonian agents aver that perfect harmony always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's and this country till within the&s;e la&s;t ten years? Is their bani&s;hing the members of the church of England, and tho&s;e who owned allegiance to England, after &s;tripping them of their effects, a proof of this perfect harmony? Surely the worthy Bo&s;ton Agents mu&s;t have lo&s;t all memory and recollection when they advanced &s;uch a known public untruth.</P>
<P>They were required to &s;end home their patent &s;oon after the Quo Warranto was brought again&s;t it. Then they di&s;|played the &s;ame hypocritical &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and the &s;ame rebel|lious di&s;po&s;ition that they do at this pre&s;ent time. In one part of their an&s;wer, they &s;aid, they <Q>humbly pro&s;trated them&s;elves at the foot&s;tool of &s;upreme authority;</Q> in an|other part they declared, that <Q>if their patent &s;hould be taken from them, the common people would conceive them&s;elves freed from their allegiance and &s;ubjection, and thereupon would be ready to confederate them&s;elves under a new Government; and which would be a danger|ous example to other plantations.</Q> The troubles which aro&s;e in England immediately after prevented the nece&s;&s;ary regulations then intended. Indeed by our divi&s;ions and quarrels at home, Government has always been prevented
<PB N="34" REF="014255_0035_0F9358F1DAD49760">
from paying due attention to the proper regulations of the colonies.</P>
<P>There never was any thing more evident than that the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's intended to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;eparate &s;tate, and to exerci&s;e a de&s;potic power over the neighbouring co|lonies. All means that tended to forward this plan were greedily taken hold of.</P>
<P>In 1641, they gave &s;ome of their people who were remov|ing out of their colony, a very &s;urprizing commi&s;&s;ion. They confe&s;&s;ed in the preamble to this commi&s;&s;ion, that the lands de&s;igned to be taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, were without the common|wealth of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's, and that certain noble per|&s;onages in England challenged juri&s;diction there by virtue of a patent from the King; yet as they thought it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country, they granted au|thority to their people to &s;ettle upon tho&s;e lands, which they acknowledged did not belong to them, to form a Go|vernment, and to make war with every other power, civil and military.</P>
<P>To elucidate this extraordinary conduct (tho' no appolo|gy can be made for their &s;eizing and occupying lands which they agreed belonged to others of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects) it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that they obliged every inhabitant of their colony to take an OATH of FIDELITY to THEIR COMMONWEALTH; and it was gravely determined in their general court, that this Oath of Fidelity &s;hould be binding; even though the per&s;ons &s;hould no longer re&s;ide within their limits. It was upon this principle that they granted the above-mentioned &s;trange commi&s;&s;ion to the Connecticut &s;ettlers, tho' at the very &s;ame time they declared, as they them&s;elves were out of the realm of England, it could claim no juri&s;diction over them. From this, their en|croaching, rapacious, and rebellious di&s;po&s;ition is undenia|ble. They denied allegiance to the mother country, where it was due, and voted them&s;elves, and u&s;urped an authority over a neighbouring colony, where they them&s;eves, in their own commi&s;&s;ion, confe&s;s they had no right, tho' afterwards, in defiance to their own commi&s;&s;ion, they voted in their own general court, they had a right. Incon&s;i&s;tency, &s;elf-con|tradiction, and robbery, they never minded, provided it an|&s;wered their purpo&s;es of &s;elf-intere&s;t. Many in&s;tances of the &s;ame &s;pirit occur in their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on who refu&s;ed to coincide with their opinions, either religious or political, was treated in a mo&s;t &s;avage and inhuman manner. A Citizen of London happening to come to

Bo&s;ton, and differing in &s;ome trivial points of religion from the profe&s;&s;ing godly there, was &s;ummoned before their court of inqui&s;ition, and &s;o terrified, that he thought it mo&s;t prudent to remove to Plymouth, a town about forty miles di&s;tant; there however Bo&s;tonian recommendations followed him, and he was publicly whipped and driven to Rhode I&s;land. His per&s;ecutors &s;till following him with their kind chri&s;tian recommendations, at Rhode I&s;land he was fir&s;t impri&s;oned, then whipped, and afterwards bani&s;hed; from thence he fled to the town of Providence; but his per|&s;ecutions were not at an end, the Bo&s;tonians &s;ent what they called a warrant or notification to all the people of Provi|dence, requiring them to &s;ubmit to the juri&s;diction of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets. To this it was replied, that they had no au|thority over Providence. But the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed man, with &s;ome others, to be out of the reach of Bo&s;tonian cruelty, and to avoid further ill-treatment, went into the country, and purcha&s;ed &s;ome lands of an Indian Chief, for which he paid forty pounds. Even to this retreat did the malice of his enemies pur&s;ue him. The Bo&s;tonians &s;et up a claim to the lands purcha&s;ed, and ordered him and his company to appear at the court of Bo&s;ton. After the barbarous u&s;age they had received, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they would willingly comply with this order. They &s;ent back there|fore a me&s;&s;age, <Q>that they were out of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets juri&s;diction, and would acknowledge &s;ubjection to none but the &s;tate and government of Old England.</Q> This declaration exa&s;pera&s;ed the Bo&s;tonians; they &s;ent an armed force, which after re&s;i&s;tance carried them captive to Bo&s;ton, where a charge was exhibited again&s;t them in the&s;e words.</P>
<P><Q>Upon much examinantion and &s;erious con&s;ideration of your writings, with your an&s;wers about them, we do charge you to be <HI>bla&s;phemous enemies of the true religion of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and his holy Ordinances, and al&s;o of civil authority among the <HI>people of God,</HI> and par|ticularly in this juri&s;diction.</Q></P>
<P>This charge brings to our memory a tran&s;action that hap|pened &s;everal years ago in the i&s;land of Jamaica.

<P>The per&s;ecuted Londoner and his companions were brought before the merciful Bo&s;tonian Court; their writ|ings were produced again&s;t them; the Governor agreed with them in their explanation of their writings, and &s;eemed in|clinable to acquit them, but was oppo&s;ed by the re&s;t of the court. Their &s;entences will ever remain a record of infamy again&s;t the town of Bo&s;ton</P>
<P>They were condemned to work in jail, to wear &s;uch bolts and irons as might hinder their e&s;cape, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> they broke confinement, or maintained any of the bla&s;phemous abomi|nable here&s;ies with which they had been charged by the general court, or &s;hould reprove the Churches of our LORD JESUS CHRIST in the&s;e united colonies, or the civil Go|vernment, upon conviction thereof, and trial by jury, they &s;hould &s;uffer death.</P>
<P>The Bo&s;ton hypocrites, even in their own &s;entence, &s;ay that their general court charged them with bla&s;phemy, but they do not &s;ay that they proved it.</P>
<P>They were confined one winter, then bani&s;hed the juri&s;|diction of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, and the lands they had purcha&s;|ed of the Indians, their goods when they were taken pri&s;oners, were &s;eized, &s;old, and di&s;po&s;ed of as follows: To the peo|ple who took them captive, and de&s;troyed their &s;ettlement; to pay the expences of their trial, and to &s;upport them in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>In 1665 they preferred a petition to the commi&s;&s;ioner &s;ent by the King to regulate the plentations, for redre&s;s of their wrongs, alledging that, be&s;ides all the cruelties they had &s;uffered, eighty head of cattle had been taken from them. The Bo&s;tonians, in their an&s;wer, charged them with <HI>here|tical tenets,</HI> and &s;aid that the goods &s;eized did not pay for their pro&s;ecution; yet they could not vindicate them&s;elves for &s;eizing per&s;ons and goods without the limits of their ju|ri&s;diction.

<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the manners of large bodies of peo|ple and nations change greatly in a century or two: But this cannot be &s;aid of the Bo&s;tonians; they &s;till are cruel oppre&s;&s;ors and per&s;ecutors of all who deny their Sovereign Authority, or who acknowledge any dependance on Eng|land: Be&s;ides the unju&s;tifiable injuries committed on the

<P>THROUGHOUT all nature it is ob&s;ervable, that ani|mals of cruel and deceitful di&s;po&s;itions are the lea&s;t &s;u&s;cep|tible of gratitude. This ob&s;ervation may with ju&s;tice be carried into human life. It has been exemplified in the Bo|&s;tonians. The merchants, not only of London, but over all the Briti&s;h Dominions, in the year 1766, &s;trenuou&s;ly ex|erted all their intere&s;t to obtain the repeal of the Stamp Act. To this &s;truggle they were principally excited by the piteous complaints of the Bo&s;tonians, who held forth to them fallacious views of emolument. Unhappily their ex|ertions were &s;ucce&s;sful; they, and their country, have &s;ince felt it; and now are convinced of it. The mi&s;taken mer|chants, admini&s;tration, and the whole kingdom, expected gratitude would be deeply rooted in the brea&s;ts of the Bo|&s;tonians for the &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;sful effort they had made in their favour. But the obligation was too great for their narrow &s;ouls to comprehend in its full extend; admini&s;teration wi&s;h|ed the Bo&s;tonians to receive the repeal, granted at the earn|e&s;t reque&s;t of the whole mercantile body of Great Britain, with moderation and thankfulne&s;s. The merchants of Lon|don, impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame ideas, wrote cautionary letters to their principal corre&s;pondents, not to &s;hew any undue &s;igns of exultation. But the repeal had been granted, and their monitions were treated with contempt.

<P>FROM the tremendous News-paper threats of the piti|ful Bo&s;tonians, people, who did not know them, would be apt to believe them a very powerful city.

The truth is, that this very great town of Bo&s;ton contains of men, wo|men, children, and negroe &s;laves, about <HI>fifteen thou&s;and &s;ouls.</HI> What, cries our good people here, negroe &s;laves in Bo&s;ton! It cannot be! It is neverthele&s;s very true. For though the Bo&s;tonians have grounded their rebellions on the "immutable laws of nature," and have re&s;olved in their Town Meetings, that <Q>It is the fir&s;t principle in civil &s;o|ciety, founded in nature and rea&s;on, that no law of &s;oci|ety can be binding on any individual, without his con&s;ent given by him&s;elf in per&s;on, or by his repre&s;entative of his own free election.</Q> Yet notwith&s;tanding the immutable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of nature, and this public re&s;olution of their own in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">own Meeting, they actually have in town two thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.

Negroe &s;laves, who neither by them&s;elves in per&s;on, nor by repre&s;entatives of their own free election ever gave con&s;ent to their pre&s;ent &s;tate of bondage. That this great Town of Bo&s;ton, which contains about 3000 able, but not willing men to fight has di&s;turbed the whole Briti&s;h empire for the&s;e la&s;t ten years with their &s;editious clamours is certainly fact. This however is not a&s;&s;erted in prai&s;e of our vigour, but in prai&s;e of our moderation. Like cowards unoppo&s;ed they have pu&s;hed their in&s;urrections and trea&s;ons to the la&s;t ex|tremity, and are now awaiting their puni&s;hment. Notwith|&s;tanding all their bravadoes, the faction there does not a|mount to a fourth part of the inhabitants. If there had been any vigour in the magi&s;tracy many of their outrages might have been prevented; but there unhappily prevails a|mong the mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects of that town, an opinion that they can do nothing of them&s;elves, without the intervention of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature here. So that the faction, tho' &s;mall when compared to the re&s;t of the inhabitants, have hitherto carried every thing before them. Their late mad action has brought their affairs to a cri&s;is; and no man can be a friend to his country who oppo&s;es their puni&s;hment. Indeed puni&s;hment it cannot be called, they are only at pre&s;ent to pay for the tea they have wantonly de&s;troyed.

<P>ALTHOUGH the original pretences which the Bo&s;toni|ans held forth for their emigration from this country, were the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, yet we have &s;hewn that they not only denied the enjoyment of the&s;e liberties to many of their fellow &s;ubjects, but that they per|&s;ecuted them in the mo&s;t illegal, oppre&s;&s;ive, and unrelenting manner. Indeed hypocrites are the mo&s;t cruel of all per&s;e|cutors.</P>
<P>But the exerci&s;e of their oppre&s;&s;ions and cruelties were not confined to individuals. Who&s;e Colonies felt the unju&s;t ex|actions of the haughty and tyrannical Bo&s;tonians.

General Court, impo&s;ing a duty upon the other Colonies, of which the following is an extract.</P>
<Q><P>It is therefore ordered by this Court, and the authori|ty thereof, that all goods belonging or any way appertain|ing to any inhabitants of the juri&s;diction of Plymouth, Connecticut or Newhaven, that &s;hall be imported within the Ca&s;tle, or exported from any part of the Bay, &s;hall pay &s;uch cu&s;tom as is hereafter expre&s;&s;ed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> all &s;kins of beaver, otter, mou&s;e, mou&s;e deer, &amp;c. two pence per &s;kin; and all goods packed in hog&s;heads or otherwi&s;e, ten &s;hillings a ton; corn and meal two pence a bu&s;hel; bi&s;cuit &s;ix pence per hundred, on pain of forfeiture.</P></Q>
<P>We &s;hall now give a comentary on this extraordinary u&s;ur|pation of &s;upreme power over the adjoining Colonies, writ|ten by one of their own hi&s;torians. Had, &s;ays he, the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ets laid a duty on goods from Connecticut only, as they had the di&s;pute with them, they might have had at lea&s;t a colour to ju&s;tify them; but to extend their re&s;entment a|gain&s;t the other two colonies, no excu&s;e can be framed for it. It was a mere exertion of power, and a proof of their great &s;uperiority, which enabled them in effect to depart from the union or combination of the Colonies for their mu|tual defence, when&s;oever they found it for their intere&s;t; and if done by a &s;ingle magi&s;trate would have been pronoun|ced tyrannical and oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Upon the pa&s;&s;ing this law, the two Colonies of Plymouth and Newhaven, being too weak to contend with the power of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, ob&s;erved in reply, that a burthen&s;ome cu&s;tom had been impo&s;ed on them, though they were not in|tere&s;ted in the di&s;pute, but had interfered at the reque&s;t of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and had impartially con&s;idered the mat|ter and given their opinion; therefore they recommended it to the General Court of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider whether &s;uch proceedings agreed with the law of love, and the tenor and import of the articles of their confederation.</P>
<P>This is &s;trong evidence of their gra&s;ping, encroaching, and de&s;potic principles. The troubles then in England left them at full liberty to act as they plea&s;ed, and to exerci&s;e their &s;overeign authority over their neighbours, as be&s;t &s;uit|ed their will and plea&s;ure. In our days, we find them &s;till deceitful and oppre&s;&s;ive. Four years ago they &s;topped all intercour&s;e with New Hamp&s;hire and Rhode I&s;land, becau&s;e the&s;e provinces imported goods from England publickly, whil&s;t they them&s;elves, the profe&s;&s;ing Bo&s;tonians, imported

a thou&s;and times the quantity privately, and were anathe|matizing and driving out of their hypocritical town every per&s;on who refu&s;ed to join in their unwarrantable mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Another "principal end of their plantation" according to their own profe&s;&s;ions, was the glorious propagation of the Go&s;pel among the poor Heathen Their methods of conver&s;ion were truly Spani&s;h; they propagated the Go&s;pel by the &s;word; they &s;eized the Indian lands, that the&s;e poor Heathen might have nothing to care for but their &s;alvation, and then cut their throats for the good of their &s;ouls: Even the tenderne&s;s of females was no protection, no &s;afeguard, again&s;t the rapacious inhuman cruelty of tho&s;e holy hypo|crites; men and women, without di&s;crimination, and with|out pity, fell &s;acrifices to their lu&s;t of acqui&s;ition. Soon af|ter their fir&s;t intru&s;ion they took &s;everal captives; the men were put to the &s;word upon the &s;pot, and the Indians in al|liance with them claiming the women, they murdered them al&s;o to end the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The treatment of <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> a famous Indian Sachem, will &s;ufficiently di&s;play New England treachery and barba|rity. Under the pretence that he was their enemy, and was plotting their ruin, they exhibited articles of complaint again&s;t him, and required him to come to Bo&s;ton to give &s;a|tisfaction. <HI>Miantonimo</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a noble and manly &s;pirit; he came in per&s;on to the Court, and demanded, <Q>that his accu&s;ers &s;hould be brought face to face, and that, if they failed in their proof, they &s;hould &s;uffer death as he him|&s;elf would have de&s;erved that puni&s;hment, if he had been guilty</Q> His compo&s;ed, ingenuous and &s;pirited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our confounded his accu&s;ers; the Connecticut people, to fi|ni&s;h the trial, were going to fall upon him and de&s;troy him, but were prevented by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Thus he was &s;av|ed at this time, but marked out for future murder.</P>
<P>About three years after, he was unfortunately taken pri|&s;oner by the Indians, and carried alive as an acceptable &s;a|crifice to the New Englanders. The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the united Colonies were then a&s;&s;embled. After keeping him a con&s;iderable time in pri&s;on, they ordered the Indians to car|ry him out of their juri&s;diction, and &s;lay him. This &s;entence was immediately executed, &s;everal of the New Englanders accompanying the Indians to &s;ee the murder duly per|formed.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he remained in pri&s;on he was fed with the hopes of life, provided his &s;ubjects would contribute a &s;ufficient ran&s;om. The poor Indians had nothing but their wampum

<P>Such deceitful barbarity rou&s;ed the re&s;entment of the In|dians. The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Colonies to prevent a war, entered into what they called an examination of the allega|tions again&s;t them&s;elves; and the following is what they thought proper to publi&s;h in defence of them&s;elves and their countrymen.</P>
<P><Q>Some loo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed, that for &s;uch quanti|ties of wampum, and &s;uch parcels of other goods, to a great value, there might have been &s;ome probability of &s;paring his life; yet no &s;uch parcels were brought, not any ran&s;om agreed, nor &s;o much as any &s;erious treaty be|gun, to redeem their impri&s;oned Sachem: and as to the wampum and goods, they were but &s;mall parcels, and &s;carce con&s;iderable for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, &s;o they were di&s;|po&s;ed of by <HI>Miantonimo</HI> him&s;elf, to &s;undry per&s;ons, for courte&s;ies received during his impri&s;onment, and upon hope of future favour.</Q></P>

<P>THERE is &s;uch a &s;uperlative degree of effrontery in the faction of Bo&s;ton, and in their defenders here, that if we had not the fulle&s;t proofs of their outrageous trea&s;ons, we very probably might be led to conceive that all the truths told us of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> were only, as they call them, the mi&s;repre|&s;entations of their enemies.

They declare, that the mea&s;ures of Parliament to bring back the Bo&s;ton rebels to their duty are wor&s;e than Star Chamber proceedings, adopted without accu&s;ation, or even &s;hadow of evidence. Surely the flowery agent who hazarded the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, imagined that his &s;ingle anonymous affirmation would outweigh truth it&s;elf.

Yet after all tho&s;e villanies and trea&s;ons we are told, there is no evi|dence again&s;t them. There is one thing, however, in which every rational man will agree with Mr. Agent&punc; that is, that <Q>the tea was de&s;troyed by the avowed enemies of the town of Bo&s;ton;</Q> for no &s;et of men but the faction at Bo&s;ton, who have always been the avowed enemies both of their town and country, would have, for the&s;e many years back committed &s;o many cowardly and infamous acts of abu&s;e and oppre&s;&s;ion.

I will remember you of &s;ome: When we fir&s;t &s;et up reformation in our church-way, did not this expo&s;e us to as great an hazard as we could run, both from abroad and at home? Did not our friends in Eng|land forewarn us of it, ere we came away?

<P>Again, when, upon grievous complaints again&s;t us to the Lords of the Privy Council, of &s;uch civil innovations among&s;t us as we could not ju&s;tify by the laws of that &s;tate, a &s;trict order and command was &s;ent on us to deliver up our Patent, or el&s;e to expect to have it fetched by force. What greater danger could there be towards us, than appeared in not obeying this command? Yet we had then courage enough to return an an&s;wer, without our patent.</P>
<P>When we undertook a war again&s;t the Piquots, which no nece&s;&s;ity put us upon, but only in point of con&s;cience, for they had done us no injury, our friends of Plymouth complained of it; &s;o did our friends of Connecticut, lay|ing forth the dangers we had expo&s;ed them unto by it, wi&s;hing we had forborne to a fitter &s;ea&s;on: Yet in due time the Lord's hand appeared in it, to the good of the whole country, and we felt but little of tho&s;e great dangers which were ju&s;tly to be feared.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a good &s;en&s;e and candour inherent in human nature when not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;ed by prejudices. Superior to all other nations the&s;e endowments prevail in the minds of Engli&s;hmen. In a que&s;tion debated before the tribunal of the public, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to ground it on the principles of common &s;en&s;e and of law, and they immediately are ma&s;ters of it; for common &s;en&s;e and the law of the king|dom are nearly allied. It mu&s;t however be allowed that the fully arguments of vanity and &s;elf-intere&s;t very often betray us into a temporary oppo&s;ition to our own welfare. In&s;idi|ous deceivers hang out to us fal&s;e notions of our rights, at the very time they are robbing us of our long-boa&s;ted privi|leges. The hireling, of faction thunder out again&s;t us de|lu&s;ive threats, that they may more readily lead us into mea|&s;ures de&s;tructive to our real intere&s;t. The good of the &s;tate is their bane: they can only live in troubled waters; and therefore when hunger pre&s;&s;es, they endeavour to in&s;til into us fears formed in their Garret Manufactory. We are; it &s;eems, to be ruined if we puni&s;h the outrageous Bo&s;tonians for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> repeated rebellions. England is to be undone if &s;he pre&s;umes to introduce order and government into the

Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets: Surely no Engli&s;hman in his &s;en|&s;es can be &s;wayed with &s;uch empty menaces. The hou&s;e|breaker and the murderer, when puni&s;hment is awarded, might as well threaten us with the downfall of our con&s;tituti|on, and upon as good grounds, as the traiterous Bo&s;tonians and their agents. Individuals corporations, and Colonies, are all equally amenable to the laws; and when any of them endanger the welfare of the &s;tate, they are not only liable to, but de&s;erving of, puni&s;hment. It would be con&s;idered as a very extrardinary defence at the Old Bailey, if a cul|prit on trial there, for breaking open Mr. Sheriff's hou&s;e on Tower Hill, &s;hould declare that as he had never given his con&s;ent to the laws again&s;t Burglary, either by him&s;elf in per&s;on, or by a repre&s;entative of his own choice, that there|fore he could not be legally condemned. Notwith&s;tanding this Bo&s;tonian defence, he would certainly he brought in guilty; and in &s;pite of all his clamours for a vote in the choice of repre&s;entatives for the City of London, I fancy that the mo&s;t patriotic gentlemen of the London Tavern would not endeavour to re&s;cue him from undergoing the puni&s;hment of his crimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Tyburn.</P>
<P>This is only de&s;igned as a preparatory hint to tho&s;e gen|tlemen who are &s;uch warm advocates in defence of the rebel|lion at Bo&s;ton. Their future fate depends on their future good behaviour. For no rea&s;onable man &s;urely would wi&s;h to animadvertion, or to expo&s;e, the&s;e per&s;ons, who are &s;en|&s;ible of the delinquency of their Con&s;tituents: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if cer|tain per&s;ons are in a proper &s;tate of mind, it would be be&s;t proved by their &s;ilence.</P>
<P>And now for the venerable forefathers of the loyal Saints of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The tyranny, iniquities, and rebellious conduct of the venerable patriarchs of New England, as well as of their hopeful progeny, the pre&s;ent Bo&s;tonians, have already been &s;trongly elucidated. From their own public declarations we have &s;een, that to &s;erve their own plundering inhuman purpo&s;es they brought the &s;acred Commandments of the Al|mighty to authori&s;e their depradations and cruelties towards the poor Indians. They fir&s;t proved, to their own &s;atisfac|tion, that the Indians were not their neighbours; and then they proceeded to "rob and kill them," as opportunity of|fered.</P>
<P>When the minds of the&s;e venerable mi&s;creants were load|ed with &s;uch a weight of oppre&s;&s;ive guilt, it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed they would boggle at trivial crimes. Their continued

tyrannic exertions, exerci&s;ed in an inferior degree, &s;erved to alleviate and deaden the recollection of their more dreadful barbarities. Con&s;tant action was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in or|der to &s;tem the ince&s;&s;ant tide of heartrending reflection. Their unju&s;tifiable oppre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who followed the rites of the Engli&s;h Church were therefore to them a relief from care, and &s;erved as a mere pa&s;time.</P>
<P>In 1646, &s;everal per&s;ons of note, members of the Church of England, pre&s;ented a petition to the General Court at Bo&s;ton, complaining <Q>That the fundamental laws of Eng|land were not owned by the Colony as the ba&s;is of the Government; that they were denied the enjoyment of their religious privileges; that they were debarred from all civil employments, without any ju&s;t cau&s;e, not being permitted to hear the lea&s;t office, though it could not be denied they were well qualified; that they had not even a vote in choo&s;ing magi&s;trates, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> other civil or military Officers, notwith&s;tanding they had expended their youth, borne the burden of the day, wa&s;ted much of their e&s;tates for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the&s;e poor plantations, paid all a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ments, rates, taxes, at lea&s;t equal, if not exceeding o|thers; yea, when the war was denounced again&s;t the Nar|rowgan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et Indians, without their con&s;ent, their goods were &s;eized on far the &s;ervice, them&s;elves and &s;ervants, e&s;pecially, forced and <HI>impre&s;&s;ed</HI> to &s;erve in the war, to the hazarding of all things mo&s;t dear and near unto them: That therefore they de&s;ire that civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all Engli&s;hmen, without impo&s;ing any oaths or covenants on them, which could not be warranted by the Letters Patent, and which &s;eem|ed not to concur with the Oath of Allegiance impo&s;ed by Parliament, or, at lea&s;t, detracted from their native coun|try and laws, which were &s;tiled <HI>foreign,</HI> and this place termed rather a <HI>free &s;tate,</HI> than a Colony or corporation of England.

<P>The above declarations of the Great and General Court of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets conveened at Bo&s;ton is, at once, ridicu|lous, laughable, and dete&s;tible. The Petition, they &s;ay, was the fir&s;t of the &s;ort, and of con&s;equence without prece|dent. It was al&s;o a daring pre&s;umption in tho&s;e who believ|ed and practi&s;ed the mode of wor&s;hip according to the Eng|li&s;h Churches, to beg leave to prai&s;e God according to their own con&s;ciences!&mdash;Nay, it was an uncharitable, corrupt, and dangerous project That it was dangerous, indeed, the poor Church of Englandmen &s;oon &s;everely felt. The Rebels of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets impudently declared, that their con&s;titution was framed according to the laws of England, at the very moment they refu&s;ed the Petitioners leave to wor&s;hip God af|ter the manner of the Church of England. And what was &s;till more arbitrary, the Epi&s;copalians were fined every Sun|day five &s;hillings if they did not attend the Bo&s;tonian inde|pendent meeting hou&s;es, to hear their own church govern|ment and religious principles reviled in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms of abu&s;e. The Petitioners in the General Court declaration are called impudent &s;landerers, becau&s;e they could not charge the profe&s;&s;ing Saints with any thing morally evil: Yet it is plain the Petitioners had charged them with vile imoralities, for one part if the reply of the Godly Bo&s;tonians is as fol|lows:</P>

<P>And for that &s;hameful di&s;ea&s;e they mention, we may &s;ee how ready they are to publi&s;h any thing to our di&s;|grace.

There came, indeed, the la&s;t year out of England a lewd per&s;on infected with this di&s;|ea&s;e, who &s;tayed not long with us, but &s;ince his departure &s;ome others have been infected, but by what means we cannot find.&mdash;But this was more ob&s;erveable wherein the Remon&s;trants might have &s;een the good hand of the Lord towards us, that a &s;tranger coming into the country at

</LETTER>
<P>Here we find the General Court vindicating the Govern|ment (which indeed was not charged) from any &s;u&s;picion of its being affected with the foul di&s;ea&s;e alluded to. They con|fe&s;s, however, that a lewd per&s;on from England had been admitted among&s;t them; and that even after he had depart|ed, &s;everal of them had been infected, they could not tell how. But &s;till keeping up their bla&s;phemous hypocri&s;y, they ble&s;s the Lord for &s;ending into their unpolluted land, a &s;kil|ful &s;tranger who &s;peedily cured all the &s;eed of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>But it is time to animadvert upon the other parts of the General Court declaration.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that &s;ome of the Petitioners having re&s;ided for|merly in Virginia, in Kent, and in London; their being con|cerned in maritime affairs, in te&s;tamentary, matremonial and Chancery ca&s;es, were &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for the Phari&s;aical Bo&s;tonians refu&s;ing them civil and religious liberty. Any tittle, circum&s;tance, or &s;ituation in life appears to have been urged at a &s;olid rea&s;on again&s;t the Petitioners. Protection, &s;afety, and tolera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, were denied them, becau&s;e they were Doctors, Batchelors, Sojourners. One was rejected becau&s;e he was one of their own Church Members, another becau&s;e he was a Freeman, others as they were Clerks, or Merchants; and amid&s;t the multitude of their wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e valid rea&s;onings, in|nocent old age was to be per&s;ecuted only becau&s;e the Petiti|oner was an old London Grocer.</P>
<P>After the Great and General Court had &s;ent abroad the above learned Manife&s;to, they &s;ummoned the Petitioners be|fore them. The charge again&s;t them was contemptuous and &s;editious expre&s;&s;ions. In vain they urged their right to Pe|tition; in vain they claimed an appeal to the Courts in Eng|land: they were all &s;everely fined. And be&s;ides this puni&s;h|ment, the Reverend New England Saints, headed by Pro|phet Cotton, thundered out damnation again&s;t them from all the pulpits throughout the Holy Land.</P>
<P>Many of the Petitioners re&s;enting the &s;everity of their per|&s;ecution and puni&s;hment, re&s;olved to go home and complain of the Lord's people. But the&s;e Phara&s;ees entreated the Lord to confound them, and he heard their prayers; for their per&s;ons were apprehended, their hou&s;es plundered, and their papers &s;eized: So that through the Lord's gracious a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,

Should it be replied, that there is no exemption from taxation in their Charter, you mu&s;t then &s;ay their Charter implies it; although it &s;hould be an untruth; for perhaps your opponent has never &s;een the Charter, and then he cannot contradict you.

&s;upported, This is the real private and public character Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>The unanimity, therefor of the public, relative to the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by Parliament, for the indemnification of the India Company, and for the regulation and pre&s;ervation of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, is far from &s;urpri&s;ing; it is natural, and from the beginning of the bu&s;ine&s;s, was rea&s;o|nably to be expected. The people of Bo&s;ton them&s;elves have pre&s;&s;ed upon us full and repeated proofs of their dangerous commotions, in&s;urrections, and unju&s;tifiable acts. They have even forced conviction upon tho&s;e, who were mo&s;t un|willing to believe any thing to their prejudice&mdash;their be&s;t friends.</P>
<P>Granting compen&s;ation for the tea de&s;troyed is but a mat|ter of ju&s;tice to the India Company; blocking up the port of Bo&s;ton till the inhabitants &s;ay they are peaceable and return to their duty, is a ju&s;t, but a temporary expedient. The con&s;titution of their internal government mu&s;t be altered, that the people hereafter may be re&s;trained within the due bounds of law; for all liberty without the circle of the law, is licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h the great purpo&s;e of re&s;toring the laws to their primitive vigour and operation, the Charter of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets mu&s;t be annihilated. It is con&s;tructed on princi|ples much too democratic, and &s;ubver&s;ive of all peace, good order, and government; it is held forth to us by the Bo&s;tonian rioters not only as their warrant for the commi&s;&s;ion of all &s;orts of criminal violence, but al&s;o as their &s;helter and defence again&s;t ju&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>This Charter, upon which &s;o many flagrant riots and in|&s;urrections have been grounded and vindicated, &s;hould &s;ure|ly undergo proper revi&s;ion and alteration. The Governor by this Charter, con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from the Council, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o power. The Council con&s;i&s;ts of twenty eight members, annually cho&s;en by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; without the advice and con&s;ent of &s;even Coun&s;ellors the Governor cannot act. To the appointment of Judges, Commi&s;&s;ioners of Oyer and Terminer, Sheriffs, Provo&s;t Mar&s;hlls, Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and other Officers belonging to the Council and Courts of Ju&s;tice, the Governor mu&s;t have the voice of &s;even Coun&s;ellors: now, though the&s;e Coun&s;ellors to his Maje&s;|ty's Governor are &s;worn to the due and faithful performance of the duties of their office, yet as they are annually cho&s;en by the people, on every emergency they act rather as Coun|&s;ellors of the mob, than as &s;upporters of law and govern|ment.
<PB N="58" REF="014255_0059_0F93590D95E6A4C8">
The choice of the Council ought therefore mo&s;t cer|tainly to be &s;olely ve&s;ted in the crown, as it is in mo&s;t of the other provinces</P>
<P>Another nece&s;&s;ary regulation is the aboli&s;hing of Town Meetings: the herd of Fools and Knaves collected together in Faneuil Hall, we have been convinced are capable of the mo&s;t rebellious re&s;olutions; they have &s;hewn the will, but happily they wanted the power actually to revolt. They &s;hould only be authori&s;ed once a year to meet to chu&s;e their Town Officers; this is &s;ufficient employment for the rabble that mu&s;ter in the Town Hall at Bo&s;ton, and is in fact their only proper bu&s;ine&s;s when a&s;&s;embled there; but the &s;mugglers a|mong them&s;elves, and the de&s;peradoes of faction here, have taught them to repeal acts of our &s;upreme legi&s;lature. Indeed the Bo&s;ton Town Meeting has only been the tool of the learned Agent, who is him&s;elf the tool of the infatuated re|pealers of the Stamp Act.</P>
<P>The Town Meeting at Bo&s;ton is the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;edition.</HI> It is there that all their dangerous in&s;urrections are engen|dered; it is there that the flame of di&s;cord and rebellion was fir&s;t lighted up and di&s;&s;eminated over all the provinces; it is therefore greatly to be wi&s;hed that Parliament may re&s;cue the loyal inhabitants of that town and Province from the mercile&s;s hand of an ignorant mob, led on and inflamed by &s;elf-intere&s;ted and profligate men.</P>
<P>As the Town Meetings are only frequented by the &s;mug|glers and the &s;editious, it may ea&s;ily be conjectured what &s;ort of men are cho&s;en to &s;erve on juries. The Town Meeting at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of electing Jurors. The mo&s;t factious, abandoned, and &s;hamele&s;s are therefore always pre|&s;ented to this Office, &s;o that they often fit on the grand Jury, to examine evidences again&s;t them&s;elves, and on the petit Jury, to try their own mi&s;demeanors and crimes. The i&s;&s;ue of the trial cannot be doubted. There is no &s;uch thing as publi&s;hing an adherent of the faction. It would be wonder|full indeed if a knave and plunderer was to give a verdict a|gain&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>About &s;even years ago, one of the pre&s;ent repre&s;entatives of the Town of Bo&s;ton, and al&s;o one of their &s;elect men, and the idol of the faction, thought proper to exerci&s;e the Bo&s;to|man liberty of running a cargo of Madeira wine. This breach of the laws was carried on in the mo&s;t open audaci|ous manner. Two Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Officers on board the ve&s;|&s;el were put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> confinement. The Repre&s;entative and Magi&s;trate him&s;elf was pre&s;ent, and carou&s;ed with his party
<PB N="59" REF="014255_0060_0F93590E665556D8">
till this exertion of general freedom was accompli&s;hed; next day the ve&s;&s;el was &s;eized; but the faction mu&s;tered their rag|gamuffins, attacked the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Officers, knocked down with brickbats and bludgeons the Collector and his Son, the Comptroller and In&s;pector. The fir&s;t, an elderly, vene|rable gentleman, has not to this day recovered their barba|rons treatment.</P>
<P>As this a&s;&s;ault and riot was committed in open day, the per&s;ons concerned were well known; it was re&s;olved to pro|&s;ecute them in law: but the faction effectually put a &s;top to this intention; at Town Meeting they cho&s;e the Rioters them&s;elves Grand Jurymen: the pro&s;ecutions were with|drawn of cour&s;e, for it would have been ridiculous to have expended time and money in a cau&s;e where the delinquents were to be their own Judges.</P>
<P>The Jurors ought to be appointed by the Sheriff.</P>
<P>Can peace, obedience to the laws, and loyalty be expected among&s;t people under &s;uch an ab&s;urd injudicious con&s;titution of government? where criminals are placed by their guilty companions on the &s;eat of judgment in order to acquit them|&s;elves; where his Maje&s;ty's Coun&s;ellors are cho&s;en by the people, and unre&s;trained even by the &s;olemnity of their oaths, always vote in direct oppo&s;ition to his authority and to the authority of the laws Similar would be the ab&s;urdity if our Hou&s;e of Commons were annually to elect our Hou&s;e of Peers. The Upper Hou&s;e depending on the Lower Hou&s;e for its po|litical exi&s;tence, would in&s;tantly lo&s;e all its dignity, weight, impartiality and independence. Thus his Maje&s;ty's Coun|&s;ellors in the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, are only the de&s;pi|cable and willing tools of the factious independents and &s;mugglers.</P>
<P>For all the&s;e rea&s;ons, and that good order and government may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in that long di&s;tracted Provinces, their Town Meetings &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, their Juries &s;hould be cho&s;en by the Sheriffs, his Maje&s;ty's Coun&s;ellors by him&s;elf, and their pre&s;ent fooli&s;h incon&s;i&s;tent Charter, which will re|flect indelible di&s;grace on them who penned and pa&s;&s;ed it, &s;hould be cancelled, vacated, and anihilated, and another granted them more conformable to the con&s;titution of Eng|land.</P>

<P>His Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to give me for an example a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;tance of what had lately happened in relation to the right of judicature claimed by the Hou&s;e of Lords in Ire|land, which they had long been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, without ad|mitting any appeal from their decrees to the Hou&s;e of Lords here; but upon &s;ome offence, which they had lately gi|ven, a Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e to annul that right. It was entitled, <HI>A Bill for the better &s;ecuring the dependance of Ireland on the Crown of Great Britain,</HI> and it pa&s;&s;ed without a divi&s;ion: This his Lord&s;hip &s;aid would be our fate on a like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I told his Lord&s;hip that his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in New England were a virtuous indu&s;trious people, and univer|&s;ally loyal. His Lord&s;hip an&s;wered in a very obliging manner. That he really believed we were in the main that good people I had repre&s;ented, but then made this advantage of it, that it was the more grievous to the go|vernment here to receive ill treatment from tho&s;e who were in other re&s;pect &s;o dutiful and loyal to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>I prayed his Lord&s;hip to in&s;tance in what we had offend|ed, and was an&s;wered,</P>
<P>That we denied the right of the Crown to the woods.</P>
<P>That we invaded the prerogative in refu&s;ing the Gover|nor's negative power, though &s;ettled and ve&s;ted in him by Charter.</P>
<P>That by &s;everal votes and re&s;olutions of the Lower Hou&s;e, printed in their Journals, we &s;hewed an inclinati|on to be independent of admini&s;tration here.</P>
<P>That we treated the King's commands as wa&s;te paper, particularly in not &s;ettling a proper &s;alary on our Gover|nors, which the re&s;t of the King's Provinces had done, and which had been often and earne&s;tly recommended to us by the Crown.</P>
<P>And to the&s;e things his Lord&s;hip added, that we treat|ed Colonel Shute the King's Repre&s;entative, with great contempt, notwith&s;tanding we could not rea&s;onably ex|pect
<PB N="62" REF="014255_0063_0F935910AE380FD0">
a better Governor, unle&s;s we intended to nominate one our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the matters which his Lord&s;hip chiefly in|&s;i&s;ted upon:</P>
<P>To all which I made the be&s;t an&s;wers I am able; e&s;pe|cially as to the two articles of the right of the woods and the negative power; in both which I always thought, and do &s;till think, that the A&s;&s;embly may be ju&s;tified. Yet I hope I &s;hall be pardoned, if I &s;ay, from the long experi|ence I have had in your affairs, that when we are never &s;o much in the right, it is our true intere&s;t to defend that right with mode&s;ty, and conduct it with prudence.</P>
<P>For a conclu&s;ion, his Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, if I was able to acquit the A&s;&s;embly of any evil intentions and wilful faults, yet they were at lea&s;t chargeable with great imprudences.</P>
<P>And he then de&s;ired me again to recommend to them, for their own &s;akes, a more di&s;creet conduct.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After the peru&s;al of the many flagrant enormities and crimes committed by the provincial a&s;&s;embly of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets, and of the above authentic extract, will any candid and hone&s;t man &s;ay, that the&s;e people have always been dutiful and loyal? If the que&s;tion was put to the <HI>father of the lies</HI> him&s;elf, he would he&s;itate and blu&s;h amid&s;t his infernal horrors, before he an&s;wered it in the affirmative.</P>
<P>Their Agent, thought it was evidently his intere&s;t to ex|cu&s;e his con&s;tituents, in every point, of their bad conduct, totally gives them up with regard to their bad u&s;age of their Governor, their not appointing him an adequate &s;alary, their treating his Maje&s;ty's commands as wa&s;te paper, and their votes and re&s;olutions of Independency.</P>
<P>Concerning the Negative power, and the right of the King to the woods, which Mr. Agent declared the a&s;&s;embly might be ju&s;tified in denying, no doubt, in order to pre&s;erve their favour, the be&s;t an&s;wer that can be given will be to quote the Charter it&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>And we do, by the&s;e pre&s;ents, for us, our heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, e&s;tabli&s;h and ordain, That in the framing and pa&s;&s;ing all &s;uch Orders, Laws, Statutes and Ordinances, and Elections and Acts of Government what&s;oever, to be pa&s;&s;ed, made or done by the &s;aid General Court, or a&s;|&s;embly, or council, the Governor of our &s;aid province or
<PB N="63" REF="014255_0064_0F935911903F5CE0">
territory of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay, in New-England, for, the time being, &s;hall have the negative voice; and that without his con&s;ent or approbation, &s;ignified or declared in Writing, no &s;uch Orders, Laws, Statutes, or Ordi|nances, or Elections, or other Acts of Government what|&s;oever, &s;o to be made, pa&s;&s;ed or done by the &s;aid General A&s;&s;embly, or in Council, &s;hall be of any force, effect, or validity.</Q></P>
<P>The clau&s;e relative to the woods &s;hall now be given.</P>
<P><Q>And la&s;tly, for the better providing and furni&s;hing of Ma&s;ts for our Royal Navy, we do hereby re&s;erve to Us, our Heirs, and Succe&s;&s;ors, all Trees of the diameter of twenty-four inches, and upwards of twelve inches from the ground, growing upon any &s;oil or tract of land with|in our &s;aid province or territory.</Q></P>
<P>After reading the&s;e two extracts from the Charter, the mo&s;t artful &s;on of Loyola would find it an in&s;uperable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to convince us that the Governor had no right to the Nega|tive Power, and the King no right to the woods.</P>
<P>The above letter, and &s;ome other whol&s;ome advice &s;ent the Great and General Court, &s;o exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed them, that the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Mr. Dummer, without paying &s;everal years &s;alary which they owed him; and, notwith&s;tanding he publi&s;hed a pamphlet in defence of their Charter, on purpo&s;e to ingratiate him&s;elf into their good graces, all the compen&s;ation he had was a vote of their Hou&s;e, declaring <Q>that it was not for the intere&s;t of the province to continue him their Agent.</Q></P>
<P>Whenever the Agents of the Bo&s;tonians fail in procuring the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of England to their mad &s;editious claims, they are all di&s;carded as un&s;kilful, and unfaithful negotiators. The dear Saints of God, along with their virtue, loyalty and righteou&s;ne&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;s an infinite &s;hare of low cunning: They are for the mo&s;t part in arrears to their Agents, and, therefore, the charges they bring again&s;t them of inability and per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idy, &s;erve as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for with-holding their &s;alaries. It is, however, &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected, that &s;ome of their Agents now thoroughly under&s;tand their deceitful cha|racters; and endeavour by weighty packets of flattery, mi&s;re|pre&s;entation and fal&s;ehood, to open the hearts and pur&s;es of the Lord's people. What their &s;ucce&s;s will be, time only can determine; but from the hungry growlings and grumb|lings in the News-papers, one would be apt to imagine, that the holy men of Bo&s;ton had forgot to make remittances. However, the worthy Agents may be a&s;&s;ured, that if the
<PB N="64" REF="014255_0065_0F935912281D35F8">
virtuous and godly Bo&s;tonians &s;hould after all their labour&punc; neglect their temporal welfare, that they will be more ar|dent with regard to their &s;piritual, for they will certainly at lea&s;t nobly pay them, as they have done many of their former Agents, by fervently praying <HI>that they may be glori|ou&s;ly rewarded by the God of New England.</HI></P>

<P>TO be reduced to the mi&s;erable nece&s;&s;ity of combating known and e&s;tabli&s;hed facts, is of all &s;ituations the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; yet &s;uch is the voluntary unhappy conditi|on of the defenders and agents of the rebellious Bo&s;tonians. The promi&s;ed and expected pay of their traiterous employ|ers wholly depends upon their vigorous efforts here; and what ca&s;e can be more humiliating and deplorable than that of the&s;e men who&s;e intere&s;t and party engage them to &s;up|port a cau&s;e in direct contradiction to their own rea&s;on and feeling! not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of hone&s;ty and &s;pirit &s;ufficient to de|cline the infamous ta&s;k, they continue to labour and to drudge in the fruitle&s;s and &s;hameful defence of their treach|erous and perfidious a&s;&s;ociates and con&s;tituents. Virtuous humanity mu&s;t pity, and rigid honour &s;purn at &s;uch deep depravity. The Bo&s;tonian writers in the News-papers, and the Bo&s;tonian Speechifiers in Parliament may be both ju&s;tly included in the above de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Leaving then the public to the recollection of the enormi|ties and barbarities already laid before them, committed by the holy men of the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, it &s;hall be the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to examine the conduct of the&s;e pretend|ed loyal &s;ubjects, re&s;pecting their allegiance to the Crown of England.</P>
<P>During the admini&s;tration of that enlightened &s;tate&s;man, Lord Carteret, we find that his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in New England were as virtuous and univer&s;ally loyal as they are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>They denied the right of the Crown to the woods, though that right was expre&s;sly re&s;erved to the Crown by the Charter.</P>
<P>They invaded the prerogative of the King in refu&s;ing the Governors negative power to Laws, Statutes, and Acts of Government, made or done by the Council or A&s;&s;embly, though &s;ettled and ve&s;ted in him by the Charter.</P>
<P>They voted and re&s;olved them&s;elves to be a people Inde|pendent on England, though they were Engli&s;h &s;ubjects,
<PB N="65" REF="014255_0066_0F935912EBF26590">
&s;ettled in a country di&s;covered by an Engli&s;hman, and ap|pertaining to the Crown of England.</P>
<P>They treated the King's commands as We&s;t Paper.</P>
<P>They would not &s;ettle a proper &s;alary on their Governors, though it had been often and earne&s;tly recommended to them by the Crown.</P>
<P>They at that time treated Colonel Shute, the King's re|pre&s;entative, with great contempt, as they have ever &s;ince done all their Governors, becau&s;e they were not nominated by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And when their Agent was called upon and examined re|lative to their trea&s;onable intentions, votes, and actions, without entering into a particular vindication of their crimes, he, like their pre&s;ent Agents, made, to u&s;e his own words, <HI>"the be&s;t excu&s;e he was able,"</HI> by confidently a&s;&s;erting <Q>that they were a virtuous people, and univer&s;ally loyal.</Q> And this vague, general, fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion, was by them always deemed a &s;ufficient apology for all their rebellious acts.</P>
<P>When the virtuous and univer&s;ally loyal Saints of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets made the above daring encroachments on the prero|gative of the Crown, and manife&s;ted their de&s;igns to throw off their allegiance, Colonel Shute was their Governor; and if any Governor &s;ent from this country could have plea&s;ed them; he certainly would have been the man. He and his family were di&s;&s;enters; he had &s;erved under King William and the Duke of Malborough, and had been wounded in one of the principal battles in Flanders; he was univer&s;ally e|&s;teemed among&s;t his acquaintance, and at Court, and like a true Engli&s;h &s;oldier, was open, and generous, humane; and a <HI>friend to liberty.</HI> But all his good qualities had no effect on the hypocritical traitors of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>At this time the&s;e loyal &s;ubjects made another flagrant at|tack on the rights of the Crown. The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives directed the Governor to give orders to all the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>During this time they were at war with the Indians.</HI></NOTE> of|ficers in command to pay proper deference and obedience to the votes and orders of the Hou&s;e concerning the regulation and management of the forces. This authoritative u&s;urpa|tion the Governor ju&s;tly excepted again&s;t, and made it a charge again&s;t the Hou&s;e to the King.</P>
<P>The malignity and villainy of the profe&s;&s;ing Saints will be clearly di&s;covered by the following fact. As they could not bend the Governor to their purpo&s;es they were determined to murder him. <Q>As he &s;at in one of the chambers of his
<PB N="66" REF="014255_0067_0F935913AAB5DE50">
hou&s;e, the window and door of a clo&s;et being open, a bullet entered through the window and door pa&s;&s;ages, and pa&s;&s;ed very near him.</Q> This was called by the righteous <HI>an accident.</HI> But the truth is, that it was a <HI>de&s;igned villainy</HI> to prevent him from going home to repre&s;ent their u&s;urpa|tions and trea&s;ons. Immediately after this horrid attempt he embarked &s;ecretly, and, on his arrival in England exhibited the following articles of complaint again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives for encroaching on his Maje&s;ty's prerogative.</P>
<P>Their denying the right of the Crown to the trees re&s;erv|ed for ma&s;ts for the Royal Navy though expre&s;sly mentioned in their Charter.</P>
<P>Refu&s;ing to admit the Governor's negative upon their choice of a &s;peaker.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uming power to appoint days of fa&s;ting and thank&s;gi|ving.</P>
<P>Adjourning them&s;elves to a di&s;tant day by their own act.</P>
<P>Di&s;mantling forts, and directing artillery and warlike &s;tores to other than the cu&s;tody of the Captain General, or his order, and u&s;urping the command of the forces, the &s;ole right of the Governor as repre&s;entative of the King.</P>
<P>Su&s;pending military Officers, and refu&s;ing their pay.</P>
<P>Appointing Committes of their own to direct and mu&s;ter his Maje&s;ty's forces.</P>
<P>Their then hou&s;e (like many of their late hou&s;es of re|pre&s;entatives, who have a&s;&s;umed the liberty of repealing acts of Parliament) voted the above complaint groundle&s;s, tho' &s;ub&s;tantially proved from their own public votes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;olu|tions; and ordered the amazing &s;um of one hundred pounds &s;terling to be remitted to their Agent, to enable him to var|ni&s;h over the rebellious proceedings of the hou&s;e, and to ex|cu&s;e them as well as he was able.</P>
<P>Mr. Cooke, who had been the principal advi&s;er, and at the head of all the mea&s;ures complained of in the above me|morial, was a&s;&s;igned the very difficult ta&s;k of defending his traiterous confederates. His notorious abilities, and the one hundred pounds, were, by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, &s;uppo&s;ed fully adequate to the accompli&s;hment of this grand point.</P>
<P>The light in which his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters viewed Mr. Cooke and the traitors of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, will be evidently &s;een by the peru&s;al of the following:</P>

<HEAD>AUTHENTIC STATE PAPER. An intere&s;ting conference, held between the Lord Pre&s;ident of his Maje&s;ty's Council, the Right Hon. Lord Town&s;hend, Secretary of State, and Eli&s;ha Cooke, E&s;quire, Agent for the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, April</HI> 30, 1725.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>REPORTS and &s;everal papers relating to the Colonies having been read to the Lords of his Maje&s;ty's Privy-Council in private, Mr. Cooke was &s;ent for in, to &s;hew a rea&s;on why a repre&s;entation might not be made of the whole affair to the King?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke.</HI> The Report of the Attorney and Solici|tor General is drawn up by men of learning; and, as <HI>I</HI> do not pretend to expre&s;s my&s;elf in a &s;uitable manner be|fore &s;uch great men, I hope your Lor&s;hips will allow me to make u&s;e of learned Coun&s;el to defend the Province.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Pre&s;ident</HI> of the Privy-Council. Had you not Coun&s;el allowed you, when your matters were heard be|fore the Attorney and Solicitor General?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke.</HI> Yes, my Lord; but I hope to make it ap|pear that Mr. Attorney and Solicitor General have made &s;ome mi&s;takes in their report, if your Lord&s;hip will allow me to be heard by Coun&s;el.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Pre&s;ident</HI> of the Privy-Council. Have you any thing new to offer, which has not been offered to the At|torney and Solicitor General?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke.</HI> Yes, I have &s;omething to &s;ay about a certi|ficate from the Secretary of the Province, &s;worn to by one Mr. Arm&s;trong, concerning Governor Shute's ordering the Committee to be paid for mu&s;tering the forces.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Town&s;hend,</HI> Secretary of State. Hark you, Mr. Cooke! I &s;peak to you now as a friend. If you in&s;i&s;t on being heard by Coun&s;el, no doubt the Lords will hear you; but then I advi&s;e you to think well of it before you a&s;k it, for I cannot an&s;wer where it may end. The expence and trouble you will bring on your&s;elf will not be little, e&s;pe|cially if it come into Parliament; and you will play a very bad game, if, &s;eeking to be Solemnly heard, you have nothing but trifles to offer in excu&s;e of a Province that has invaded the King's prerogative in every article of Government, both Civil and Military.</P>
<P>You have taken upon you to demoli&s;h forts, to march armies, to mu&s;ter troops, and to disband them when you plea&s;e, without any regard to the King's authority.</P>
<P>Depend upon it you will find your&s;elf mi&s;taken, if you
<PB N="68" REF="014255_0069_0F935916541FC390">
think a certificate about one &s;ingle circum&s;tance will ex|cu&s;e all your undutifulne&s;s to the Crown.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke</HI> I hope, my Lord, it will appear that the people of New England are as loyal as any of his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubject,!</P>
<P><HI>Lord Town&s;hend.</HI> How does that appear, when you are every day affronting the King in his governor, and treat|ing the orders of the Government, from hence, with con|tempt?</P>
<P>As to Colonel Shute he is out of the ca&s;e: You have brought things to that pa&s;s that the que&s;tion now is, <HI>who is King of New England?</HI> Whether the King, or your hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke.</HI> Sir, I hope we have no &s;uch inclination as your Lord&s;hip &s;uppo&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Town&s;hand.</HI> Why all that you have &s;aid in your ju&s;tification, &s;o far as appears in the papers now read to the Lords, makes again&s;t you.</P>
<P>How do you excu&s;e the province as to the things laid to your charge? You bring Precedents to &s;hew that they have done the &s;ame things in twenty in&s;tances before, &s;ome of which are more criminal than the things complained of. This is a very odd way of ju&s;tifying the conduct of your repre&s;entatives; and depend upon it the blame will fall very heavy &s;omewhere, if you have nothing to offer but trifles in your vindication.</P>
<P>As I &s;aid before, if you in&s;i&s;t on being heard, no doubt the Lords will grant it; but a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, you will play a very bold game to urge being heard without &s;ome|thing very material to &s;ay in the ju&s;tification of the pro|vince.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke.</HI> My Lords, if we have made any mi&s;takes, or taken any wrong &s;teps, I hope it will be imputed to the con&s;truction we thought we had rea&s;on to put upon the Charter.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Town&s;hend.</HI> As to your Charter you have forfeit|ed every article of it over and over. There is not one ar|ticle that you have not broke through, whenever it &s;tood in the way of carrying on your encroachments on the King's prerogative.</P>
<P>Pray, Mr. Cooke, let me a&s;k you, are you that Eli&s;ha Cooke &s;o often mentioned in the papers read to the Lords?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke.</HI> Yes, my Lord, I am.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Town&s;hend.</HI> Why then you have had a notable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in what has pa&s;&s;ed in New England, and can an&s;wer
<PB N="69" REF="014255_0070_0F935916CC21BE50">
the Lords one que&s;tion: Pray what is your opinion: do you think the Governor has a power to negative the Speak|er of your Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke.</HI> Yes, my Lord, I believe the Governor has power to negative a Speaker.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Town&s;hend.</HI> Well, and what &s;ecurity or a&s;&s;urances can you give to the Government, &s;uppo&s;ing the Lords &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to recommend the people of New Eng|land to the King's favour; what a&s;&s;urances can you give that your Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives will not di&s;pute the King's authority in this or any other point?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke</HI> My Lord, I have no power to give any a&s;|&s;urances of that nature.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Town&s;hend.</HI> "Pray what power have you?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Cooke.</HI> "My Lord, I am only Agent.</P>
<P><HI>Duke of Newca&s;tle</HI> Are you not one of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives there?</P>

<P>(<HI>Upon a &s;ignal given by the Lord Pre&s;ident.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>Clerk of the Council.</HI> "Gentlemen, withdraw"</P>
<P>After a few minutes Mr Cooke being &s;ent for again, de|&s;ired four or five days to con&s;ider of what their Lord&s;hips had &s;aid to him. Upon which they gave him till Tue&s;day next.</P>
<P>Mr Cooke afterward on mature con&s;ideration, thought proper to withdraw his Petition.</P>

<P>The encroachments and u&s;urpations upon the King's pre|rogative are &s;o fully and explicitly &s;tated in the preceding conference, that to give any ob&s;ervations or rea&s;oning upon it, would be meer matter of repitition. We &s;till find the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets amid&s;t all their crimes and di&s;loyal|ties, boldly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">claring, that they were as loyal as any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; which notorious fal&s;hood appears to be all their learned Agent had to &s;ay in their vindication.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the &s;trong proofs again&s;t this turbu|lent Province, nothing more was done by admini&s;tration than to pa&s;s an explanatory Charter, expre&s;sly declaring the Go|vernor's power to negative the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives, which was thought not to be &s;ufficiently clear i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Charter it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This explanatory Charter the General Court readily ac|cepted and &s;ubmitted to. They were afraid that the whole controver&s;y would be carried into Parliament; they knew they were generally condemned in England, that the Mini&s;|try
<PB N="70" REF="014255_0071_0F93591757C27178">
were highly di&s;plea&s;ed with them, and they dreaded that the con&s;equence of a Parliamentary enquiry would be an act to vacate the Charter of the Province.</P>
<P>A BAD cau&s;e confounds the be&s;t advocates; it cannot then be &s;trange to find American writers perplexed, and ad|vancing arguments which &s;erve to de&s;troy their own cau&s;e. They tell us that &s;ince the American Tea act the Coloni&s;ts have turned &s;mugglers, and have furni&s;hed them&s;elves with Teas from the French and Dutch, and not only with Teas, but with Wines, Brandy, Silk, Spices, Cambricks, and Li|nen printed and plain. And becau&s;e their Con&s;tituents have thus acted illegally, and in defiance of the Laws, they wi&s;e|ly advi&s;e the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow before the Bo&s;ton &s;mugglers, and to repeal whatever of its acts the undutiful Bo&s;tonians &s;hall direct. For the Supreme Legi&s;lature to &s;ur|render all its authority, and humbly to pro&s;trate it&s;elf to a parcel of American &s;mugglers, is to be &s;ure a new way of &s;ecuring the obedience and dependance of the Colonies, and effectually proves to us the great m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">de&s;ty and the great ge|nius of the Bo&s;ton writers. Since the people of America, from the public confe&s;&s;ion of their own writers, are &s;uch uni|ver&s;al &s;mugglers, a very different method of proceeding with them will very naturally &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf to every &s;en&s;ible man, and that is, vigorou&s;ly to &s;upport the revenue Officers in the &s;trict and vigilant performance of their duty. Their having been hitherto left without protection to the tender mercies of the riotous Bo&s;tonians, has been the true cau&s;e of the great increa&s;e of &s;muggling When part of the Revenue Officers were driven away, and the re&s;t of them intimidated, &s;muggl|ing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> became general, and the &s;weets of it once ta&s;t|ed, it became policy in the &s;mugglers to keep up the riotous &s;pirit of the people, and to foment commotions and in&s;ur|rections, that they might pre&s;erve the enjoyment of their clande&s;tine traffic. It is a well known fact, that be&s;ides va|rious &s;orts of goods run into the port of Bo&s;ton from France and Holland, and from many of the French and Dutch i&s;|lands, that in the year 1769, no le&s;s than <HI>Eight Hundred Che&s;ts of Tea</HI> were &s;muggled into that Province from St. Eu|&s;tatia. The &s;mugglers when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this Tea, by their ranting &s;peeches about oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery, per&s;uaded the ignorant populace to mob all the merchants, except them|&s;elves, who imported from England, and to take the Tea into cu&s;tody. By this artful manoeuvre Tea &s;oon became &s;earce, and as the &s;mugglers only produced theirs in &s;mall

quantities at a time, as the remains of what they had im|ported before the non-importation agreement, the price of Tea ro&s;e in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time, from two &s;hillings and three pence, to four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence a pound. This was proved by authentic letters read in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, in 1770, when American affairs were the &s;ubject of debate. It was worth the attention of the &s;mugglers to be at &s;ome trouble in rai&s;ing riots, when the con&s;equence was to be a continuance of their exorbitant gains. It was curious too that they made the very people, whom they cheated, the in&s;truments to cheat them&s;elves.</P>

<P>EVER &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, the inhabitants of that Province have evidently manife&s;ted a de&s;ign to throw off their alleigance to the Crown of Eng|land.</P>
<P>Government here were far from being in&s;en&s;ible of their intentions; for the &s;everal admini&s;trations of this country, for the&s;e <HI>hundred and forty years</HI> pa&s;t, have heartily endea|voured to provide and to guard again&s;t &s;uch a fooli&s;h, incon|&s;iderate, and di&s;loyal attempt. Yet, unhappily for this kingdom, the provi&s;ions of our former mini&s;ters were always temporary: Provided they obtained a momentary quiet they were &s;atisfied, or appeared to be &s;o; they plumed them&s;elves on the pre&s;ent efficacy of their mea&s;ures, and they left future mini&s;ters to &s;truggle with the difficulties in which they had involved the &s;tate. Thus the compleat regulation of the turbulent and rebellious New-Englanders was always left as an encumbered legacy to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. They acted like timid men, who ju&s;t a&s;&s;ert their claims that their right may not expire, but who leave the trouble, the expence, and the danger of the conte&s;t to their heirs. Such has been the weakne&s;s, the timidity, and the pitiful procra&s;tination of all our former Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>As the people of New England found, that amid&s;t all their daring encroachments and their breaches of alleigance, the good men of England were ea&s;y to be deceived by hypocriti|cal profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty; they were always provided with a plentiful &s;tock of verbal obedience, whil&s;t at the very &s;ame time they were a&s;&s;idiou&s;ly endeavouring to lay the foundati|on of their independency.</P>
<P>To be over-reached by the fine&s;&s;e of our natural enemies as negociators, has always been the characteri&s;tic of the Eng|li&s;h

nation; can it then be wondered at that we have &s;o long been trepanned by the holy di&s;&s;imulation of our own off|&s;pring?</P>
<P>The indolence of our Mini&s;ters, or rather the dread of giving ri&s;e to even unju&s;t clamours again&s;t them&s;elves, has fo&s;tered the pride of the Bo&s;tonians, that now they have not only in&s;olently a&s;&s;erted their ideas of their own independence, but al&s;o have proceeded to overt acts of oppo&s;ition to the le|gi&s;lature of this kingdom.</P>
<P>That the Bo&s;tonians have ever been turbulent and rebelli|ous, appears not only from the Acts of our King in Council, and from Acts of Parliament, but from their own Acts.</P>
<P>The Town of Bo&s;ton was fir&s;t &s;ettled in the year 1630, and two years afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were great di&s;turbances and di&s;orders among&s;t them, though at that time the Town con|&s;i&s;ted of but a few hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Next year there were both religious and political confu&s;i|ons and di&s;tractions among them, and &s;uch as had nearly ru|ined the plantation.</P>
<P>In 1634 they rai&s;ed a violent commotion in Bo&s;ton, and brought their own Governor, whom they had cho&s;en them|&s;elves, to a public trial.</P>
<P>At this period they called them&s;elves a Commonwealth; and threw off their alleigance, though their Charter, which only exempted them from taxes for &s;even years, was but five years old.</P>
<P>It was found nece&s;&s;ary in 1635 to appoint &s;ome of the prin|ciple Officers of State Commi&s;&s;ioners, who were empowered to examine Charters granted by the King or his prece&s;|&s;ors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this Commi&s;&s;ion, a <HI>Quo Warranti</HI> was brought again&s;t the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Charter, in 1636, for their oppre&s;&s;ive, illegal, and rebellious acts, which are enumerat|ed by Sir John Banks, the then Attorney General. Some of them are as follows.</P>

<P>After this the Lords of the Council &s;ent an order requir|ing them to &s;end home their patent.</P>
<P>To this letter they made their u&s;ual an&s;wer, that is, <HI>great profe&s;&s;ions</HI> of <HI>loyalty</HI> and godline&s;s, which &s;erved their pur|po&s;e at that time, and they were allowed to retain the Char|ter.</P>
<P>After this e&s;cape the wars in England prevented them be|ing attended to, and they &s;pent the forty en&s;uing years in quarrelling among&s;t them&s;elves, in robbing and murdering the Indians, in oppre&s;&s;ing the neighbouring Colonies, and in e&s;tabli&s;hing their independency.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="014255_0075_0F93591A69666B50">
In 1679 they pa&s;&s;ed a law declaring <Q>the acts of trade an inva&s;ion of their rights, liberties, and properties, they not being repre&s;ented in Parliament,</Q> For this law they &s;uffered the lo&s;s of their Charter, notwith&s;tanding they re|peated all their former hypocritical profe&s;&s;ions of duty and loyalty, and appointed many days of fa&s;ting and prayer, to obtain the King's favour, and the &s;miles of Heaven.</P>
<P>To defend their Charter, they &s;ent home Agents who in their fir&s;t letter acquainted them, <Q>that his Maje&s;ty was greatly provoked, and de&s;ired the General Court to con|&s;ider whether it was be&s;t to hazard all rather than &s;atisfy his Maje&s;ty as to the mode of Submi&s;&s;ion to the laws for regulating trade.</Q></P>
<P>In 1683, the QUO WARRANTO arrived, accompanied with a declaration from the King, that if the Colony would make full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he would regulate their Charter for his &s;ervice and their good, and with no further alterations than &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the Government there.</P>
<P>This favourable declaration had no effect; they refu&s;ed to &s;urrender the Charter, and therefore, in 1684, judgment was entered up again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Even in the height of the di&s;obedience they had the won|derful a&s;&s;urance to a&s;k favours of the King; but they were told by their corre&s;pondents in England, that it was not probable any thing would be done for them till the regula|tion of the Charter, and that the Colony was brought un|der &s;uch an actual dependence upon the Crown as became his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects</P>
<P>They remained without a Charter till after the revolution, when they &s;ent over Agents to procure the re&s;titution of their old Charter, but without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>A draught of a new Charter was made out and &s;hewn to the Rev. Mr. Mather, their Agent, who was &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied with it, that he declared he would &s;ooner part with his life than con&s;ent to it. Reply was made to him, <Q>that the con&s;ent of the Agents was not de&s;ired; the Agents of New England were not <HI>plenipotentiaries from a Sovereign &s;tate;</HI> if they declared they would not &s;ubmit to his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, the King would &s;ettle the country, and they might take what followed.</Q></P>
<P>When the Charter was granted, Mather accepted it, but Cooke, the other Agent, refu&s;ed. It was, however, accept|ed by the Province, and from its inaccuracy, confu&s;ion, and ill con&s;truction, has been one of the principal cau&s;es of all

the commotions and di&s;turbances in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets for the&s;e la&s;t eighty years.</P>
<P>From this period to the year 1722, the Province was a &s;cene of di&s;&s;ention, and in a continued ferment. The cha|racter they then held in England, and with admini&s;traton, may be &s;een in the opinions of Lord Carteret, and the Lords of Council, already printed, by which it is fully proved again&s;t them, that they had u&s;urped upon every article of the King's prerogative.</P>
<P>At this time they had great occa&s;ion for their old canting profe&s;&s;ions, and accordingly made great u&s;e of them. Their an&s;wer to every charge brought and e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t them was, <Q>that they were a virtuous, godly people, and uni|ver&s;ally loyal.</Q></P>
<P>Yet this an&s;wer, ridiculous, impudent, and fal&s;e as it was, it &s;eems, had its effect, though ab&s;olutely contradicted by the whole tenor of their conduct,. for near a century back. For with all this cloud of evidence before them, no|thing more was done by the mini&s;try than to confirm to the Crown the power of negativing the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, which when &s;o much was nece&s;&s;ary to be done, was in a manner doing nothing.</P>
<P>Indeed admini&s;tration all along &s;eemed to be exceedingly willing to get rid of them and their affairs, and therefore were content to put up with their deceitful promi&s;es to be quiet and dutiful.</P>
<P>From this time till the admini&s;tration of Mr. Grenville, many were the in&s;tances they gave of their refractory and &s;editious &s;pirit. Their criminal exce&s;&s;es need not at pre&s;ent be recounted. In the mid&s;t of their in&s;urrections Mr. Gren|ville lo&s;t his place, and unhappily for England the men who afterwards were &s;o infatuated as to repeal the Stamp Act, &s;ucceeded. To try to obtain a temporary quiet, they con|de&s;cended to &s;ubmit to the mandates of the Bo&s;ton rioters, and da&s;tardly gave up their country's be&s;t and deare&s;t rights.</P>

<P>That now after &s;uch a &s;cene of di&s;obedience, tumult and violence, in &s;ome of the American Colonies, which had been followed with the mo&s;t gracious and unparalleld in&s;tances of grace, lenity and favour, he did expect that the per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration would, be unanimous in employing the rece&s;s of Parliament about the nece&s;&s;ary and previous &s;teps to compa&s;s &s;o requi&s;ite and &s;o de&s;irable an event.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;peech, which neither needs eluci|dation nor commentary, nothing was done for the regulati|on of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Charter or any other American Char|ter.</P>

<P>FROM the review of tran&s;actions of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, from the year 1764 to 1769, it appears, by the report of the Lords Committees, that the people of that Colony have, during that period, acted in con&s;tant oppo&s;ition to the Sove|reignty of his Maje&s;ty, in his Parliament of Great Britain, over that Province.</P>
<P>They in defiance of the Laws, publicly carried on illegal traffic; they voted, in their A&s;&s;embly, their right to com|bine again&s;t Acts of our Legi&s;lature; they admoni&s;hed the other Colonies to follow their example; they declared they ought not to be taxed, becau&s;e they were not repre&s;ented; they immediately after in&s;i&s;ted that they could not be repre|&s;ented in Parliament, and therefore that they ought not to be taxed, they claimed all the immunities and privileges of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, whil&s;t they denied the authority of Britain over them, and they voted money to promote a Combinati|on again&s;t the Laws of Britain; they, in their Town Meetings, in their Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, and in their Council, openly encouraged and protected tho&s;e Criminals who had been guilty of the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable enormities, and they as openly pro&s;cribed and condemned all the Crown Officers who had exerted them&s;elves in the execution of the Laws; they, in their Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, pa&s;&s;ed an act of free and general pardon and indemnity to the Mi&s;creants who had pulled down and robbed hou&s;es and public offices, and burnt the public records; they al&s;o voted, in their Hou&s;e of A&s;|&s;embly, that Acts of Parliament were infringements of their natural rights; they, in their Council, ever refu&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection to his Maje&s;ty's Revenue Officers; they al|ways gave advice, encouragement, and &s;upport, to tho&s;e who
<PB N="79" REF="014255_0080_0F93591EF868BC20">
acted in direct violation of the Laws of Trade; they com|manded the Governor to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;hips of war from the harbour, as the&s;e &s;hips interrupted their clande&s;tine trade; and they pa&s;&s;ed votes, ordering the inhabitants of the Pro|vince to arm them&s;elves, on purpo&s;e to oppo&s;e the landing of his Maje&s;ty's troops in the Town of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>All the&s;e facts are taken from the report of the Lords Committees, and are incontrovertible.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e many complicated crimes and trea|&s;ons, his Maje&s;ty, in a &s;peech from the Throne in 1768, de|&s;ired the concurrence and &s;upport of both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment to defeat the mi&s;chievous de&s;igns of tho&s;e turbulent and &s;editious per&s;ons, who under fal&s;e pretences had but too &s;uc|ce&s;sfully deluded numbers of his &s;ubjects in America; and who&s;e practices, if &s;uffered to prevail, could not fail to pro|duce the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences to his Colonies immediate|ly, and in the end to all the dominions of his Crown.</P>

<P>THE Bo&s;tonian Agents and Writers are now driven into the regions of ab&s;urdity and contradiction, yet their folly never will be &s;ilent. They continue to a&s;&s;ure us, that if England a&s;&s;erts her ju&s;t authority over the Bo&s;tonians, that they will not pay their debts; that if the Port of Bo&s;|ton is blocked up, all the We&s;t India Planters will be &s;tarv|ed; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they will throw them&s;elves under the protection of &s;ome other European power; that they will e&s;tabli&s;h an in|dependant &s;tate; that they are now much more numerous and formidable than either the Swi&s;s or the Dutch when the&s;e nations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> off the Au&s;trian and the Spani&s;h yoke: that our men of war may take all their ve&s;&s;els for a twelve|month to come, but the&s;e captures will not pay a third of their debts: that the &s;econd year they will not &s;hip any of their produce, and &s;o we &s;hall all become bankrupts; yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all this trea&s;onable tra&s;h they tell us, that the Bo&s;to|nians

are di&s;tingui&s;hed for their duty and loyalty to their Mo|ther Country and Sovereign. Now when they convince us that loyalty and rebellion are the &s;ame, we &s;hall certainly believe them.</P>
<P>They have given us many &s;pecimens of their loyalty in the <HI>Appeal to the World,</HI> publi&s;hed by order of the Town of Bo&s;ton. In this Appeal they &s;et out with abu&s;ing Governor Bernard, General Gage, Commodore Hood the Commi&s;&s;i|oners of the American Board of Cu&s;toms and all others who, from their employments, were unfortunately obliged to re|&s;ide among&s;t them.</P>
<P>A few of their a&s;&s;ertions may be entertaining.</P>
<Q><P>Nothing can be more fal&s;e and malicious than to re|pre&s;ent this Town as di&s;affected to his Maje&s;ty's Govern|ment.</P>
<P>That the people &s;hould entertain the highe&s;t di&s;gu&s;t of a Board, in&s;tituted to &s;uperintend a revenue to be rai&s;ed from them without their con&s;ent, which was, and &s;till is, exacted with rigour, is natural.</P>
<P>But it cannot be &s;aid, with the lea&s;t appearance of truth, that they &s;et at defiance the King's Authority.</P>
<P>Governor Bernard's declarations to his Maje&s;ty's Mini|&s;ters are grounded on vague, idle reports</P>
<P>The ordering two regiments from Halifax to this Town, for a purpo&s;e for which military power was certainly never de&s;igned&mdash;a very dangerous purpo&s;e, and abhorrent to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and the &s;pirit of a free Govern|ment, namely, to &s;upport the civil authority.</P></Q>
<P>They give the following account of a riot, in which they nearly murdered the Collector and Comptroller of the Cu|&s;toms.</P>
<P><Q>The Collector and Comptroller indeed repre&s;ent it as a numerous mob, but they being particularly intere&s;ted, their fears might deceive them. It was occa&s;ioned by the unprecedented and unlawful manner of &s;eizing a ve&s;&s;el.</Q>&mdash;What they call unlawful manner, was the a&s;&s;i&s;tance given by a man of war's boat.

<P><PB N="84" REF="014255_0085_0F935926DF282A70">
But the mo&s;t capital part of this Appeal, not to the King or the Parliament, but to all the world, is, their declaration again&s;t all Acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament. It &s;hall be given in their own words.</P>
<Q><P>Their rights are invaded by the&s;e Acts, therefore untill they are all repealed, the cau&s;e of their ju&s;t complaints cannot be removed.

<P>After reading this Manife&s;to again&s;t all Acts of Parliament for rai&s;ing a revenue among&s;t them, no per&s;on will wonder at their various commotions and in&s;urrections, but will be &s;urpri&s;ed that the regulation of &s;uch a rebellious people wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not undertaken long ago, and effectually carried into exe|cution.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>A VARIETY of &s;pecimens of the literary merit, the vir|tue and the loyalty of the Meetings, A&s;&s;emblies, and Councils, held at Bo&s;ton, have already been given. At pre|&s;ent the ob&s;ervations of the Merchants of Bo&s;ton on &s;everal Acts of Parliament &s;hall be taken into con&s;ideration. The Merchants of Bo&s;ton form a part of tho&s;e &s;editious herds of Fools and Knaves which a&s;&s;emble on all important occa&s;ions in Faneuil Hall, in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, or in the Council Chamber, at Bo&s;ton; in which places, with the mo&s;t &s;anctified countenances, they preface their wi&s;e and learned harangues, and their trea&s;onable Votes and Re&s;olves, with humbly be&s;eeching the Almighty to &s;tand forth the champion of rebellion,</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the ob&s;erva|tions of the merchants &s;hould coincide with the &s;editious de|terminations of the above mentioned A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>The Bo&s;ton Merchants &s;et out with telling us, that <Q>their repre&s;entative body have fully and repeatedly remon&s;trat|ed again&s;t &s;everal Acts of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the fourth, &s;ixth, and &s;eventh years of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's reign, as uncon&s;titutional, and as infringing the rights and privi|leges of the &s;ubject.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Acts are deemed by the Bo&s;ton Merchants uncon&s;ti|tutional,
<PB N="85" REF="014255_0086_0F93592719150D10">
and an infringement of their rights, becau&s;e they are calculated to impede their clande&s;tine traffic, and becau&s;e they rai&s;e a &s;mall revenue on them and the other Colonies, amounting nearly to fifteen thou&s;and pounds yearly, which is again &s;pent among&s;t them&s;elves, whil&s;t England is at more than twenty times that expence yearly for their protection and defence.</P>
<Q><P>By the&s;e Acts certain rates and duties are impo&s;ed on Mola&s;&s;es, Sugars, Wines, Tea. To collect this revenue the Government is at a very great expence, equal at lea&s;t, and including the charge of men of war and cutters to guard the coa&s;t, va&s;tly &s;uperior to all the revenue that can be collected had our trade bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as exten&s;ive as it was be|fore the&s;e Acts were made, which is not the ca&s;e now, and never will be while they remain in force.</P></Q>
<P>All this is exceeding plain, the&s;e Acts of Parliament great|ly re&s;train their illicit trade; and as Government is at a greater expence in guarding their coa&s;t than the revenue col|lected by the&s;e Acts, they mode&s;tly propo&s;e that the&s;e Acts &s;hall be repealed that England may bear the whole burthen her&s;elf. An Engli&s;hman, however, will not think in this manner; he will naturally be of opinion, that it is but ju&s;t and rea&s;onable that additional taxes &s;hould be laid upon the Americans, in order that they may pay all the charges of their own Government.</P>
<Q><P>When the duty on Mola&s;&s;es was &s;ix pence &s;terling a gal|lon, as there was no appropriation made of that duty, it was well known in England the Officers of the Cu&s;toms connived at the importation; but &s;ince the duty on mo|la&s;&s;es has been reduced, the whole, though grievous, has been regularly paid.</P></Q>
<P>Granting this in&s;inuation of the di&s;hone&s;ty of the former Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Officers to be true, and that they connived with the Bo&s;ton &s;mugglers in running Mola&s;&s;es; the truth of &s;uch connivance is &s;urely not a good argument to obtain a licence to continue it. It operates clearly on the oppo&s;ite fide of the que&s;tion, and is a &s;trong rea&s;on for more &s;trictly enforc|ing and executing the laws of trade. The duty on mola&s;&s;es was at fir&s;t &s;ix pence a gallon; on the repre&s;entations and pe|titions of the people of Bo&s;ton it was lowered to three pence; &s;till they were un&s;atisfied, but &s;aid, if the duty was reduced to one penny a gallon, the &s;mallne&s;s of the duty would take away all inclination to &s;muggle that commodity, and there|for the revenue would increa&s;e. This reque&s;t was al&s;o grant|ed them, and now they tell Parliament that the mola&s;&s;es Act
<PB N="86" REF="014255_0087_0F93592BACCFB5D0">
is grievous, uncon&s;titutional, and as infringement of their rights.</P>
<Q><P>The duty of the five &s;hillings per hundred on brown, and twenty-two &s;hillings on white &s;ugars, is a great bur|den on our trade to the foreign I&s;lands: That, &s;hould we be allowed the free importation of foreign &s;ugars, even for our own con&s;umption, the trade of Great Britain would not be injured, but greatly benefitted; for in this ca&s;e more of the &s;ugars made in the Engli&s;h I&s;lands might be carried to Great Britain, and what they did not con|&s;ume would be exported from thence to foreign markets.</P></Q>
<P>With the Bo&s;ton Merchants, every regulation, re&s;triction, or tax, is a grievous uncon&s;titutional burden: <HI>one penny,</HI> as well as five &s;hillings, is a great burden. If they were allow|ed the free importation of foreign &s;ugars, it might probably be advantageous to them; &s;o might the free importation of tea and cordage from Holland, and open trade with all the world: But if the Engli&s;h &s;ugars now con&s;umed in Briti&s;h America were all brought to England, on account of the A|mericans &s;upplying them&s;elves from the French, the market would be glutted, the commodity would become a drug, and our We&s;t-India Planters would be ruined.</P>
<Q><P>The Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e bonds, certificates, oaths, and fees, are al&s;o great di&s;couragements and embarra&s;&s;ments to the trade of America.</P>
<P>The appointment of an almo&s;t incredible number of in|ferior Officers, as Tide&s;men, Boatmen, Waiters, and o|thers, is another cau&s;e of complaint.</P>
<P>The liberty the&s;e fellows take, of &s;earching ve&s;&s;els, is not only illegal, but impudent.</P>
<P>Another intolerable grievance is, the appointment of Officers of the Cu&s;toms on board the men of war, cutters, and other armed ve&s;&s;els.</P></Q>
<P>That Smugglers &s;hould think bonds, certificates, oaths, and fees, intolerable grievances, and wi&s;h to be relieved from all legal re&s;traints, is natural enough; but that they &s;hould write a pamphlet, on purpo&s;e to convince England that their unlawful goods &s;hould be protected from the jaws of the&s;e devouring mon&s;ters, Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers, cer|tainly manife&s;ts a mo&s;t extraordinary degree of a&s;&s;urance and folly.</P>
<Q><P>What the Coloni&s;ts have a right to expect is, a Repeal of all the Acts impo&s;ing duties on any kind of goods im|ported into the Briti&s;h Colonies, for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing
<PB N="87" REF="014255_0088_0F93592C5821FA80">
a revenue in America, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with their rights as free &s;ubjects.</P></Q>
<P>If the Bo&s;ton merchants will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider the heavy load of debt under which England labours, they, in|&s;tead of a Repeal of all the Acts of Trade and Revenue, have a right to expect that Parliament will pa&s;s a few more, in order to rai&s;e from among&s;t them&s;elves a &s;um &s;ufficient to pay for their own defence.</P>
<P>What follows, is the conclu&s;ion of this very curious pub|lication of the Bo&s;ton merchants.</P>
<P><Q>The embarra&s;&s;ments, difficulties, and in&s;upportable bur|dens, under which this trade,</Q> (no doubt meaning their illegal trade)<Q> has laboured, have already made us prudent, frugal, and indu&s;trious; and &s;uch a &s;pirit in the Coloni&s;ts mu&s;t &s;oon, very &s;oon, enable them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the manufactures of Great Britain, the Trade of which, as well as its Naval Power, has been greatly promoted and &s;trengthened by the luxury of the Colonies, con&s;equently any mea&s;ures that have a tendency to injure, ob&s;truct and dimini&s;h the American Trade and Navigation, mu&s;t have the &s;ame effect upon that of Great Britain, and in all pro|bability prove her ruin.</Q></P>
<P>The Bo&s;ton Merchants di&s;play a filial affection towards us, for having luckily di&s;covered, that if England forces them to contribute ever &s;o &s;mall a pittance to the &s;upport of the &s;tate and their own protection, that &s;uch conduct will in all probability prove her ruin; they have been at the great trouble and expence of writing a twelvepenny book on purpo&s;e to inform us of our approaching danger.</P>
<P>In &s;ome re&s;pects, however, the Bo&s;ton Merchants differ widely in &s;entiment from the re&s;t of the Saints. The generali|ty of the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets have for the be&s;t part of two centuries declared, that they were a pious, prudent, frugal, and indu&s;trious people, but the Bo&s;ton Merchants a&s;&s;ert, that till the fourth year of the pre&s;ent reign they were imprudent, prodigal, idle, and luxurious. The&s;e accounts rather con|tradict each other, and there appears no other way of ex|plaining them, than by believing that the Bo&s;ton Saints and Bo&s;ton Merchants will &s;ay any thing rather than port with their money and their clande&s;tine trade.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting their manufactures, Great Britain has nothing to fear from them. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that their ma|nufactures will be very formidable, till unoccupied lands be|come dear and &s;carce, of which there is at pre&s;ent but a very di&s;tant pro&s;pect. It is true they have a large Manufactory
<PB N="88" REF="014255_0089_0F93587CE986F758">

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1645, a civil di&s;&s;ention di&s;turbed the whole Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, for when they were at peace with their neighbours they always quarrelled among&s;t them|&s;elves. It was occa&s;ioned by a difference in &s;entiment con|cerning the identity of <HI>a &s;wine</HI> which was claimed by a poor woman as having &s;trayed from her &s;ome years before, and her title being di&s;puted by a per&s;on of more con&s;equence, not the Court only, but the whole country were divided and inflamed. The identity of the famous Martin Guerre was not more controverted in France in the preceding century. Pity for the poor woman influenced the common people a|gain&s;t right. At la&s;t the Magi&s;trates, who &s;upported the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, for the Magi&s;trates were divided too, prevailed upon the right owner, who had recovered judgment, to relin|qui&s;h the animal that the public tranquillity might be re&s;tor|ed.</P>
<P>This Hog Controver&s;y brought on a political conte&s;t be|tween the A&s;&s;i&s;tants or Council and Deputies or Repre&s;en|tatives, but as each Hou&s;e was equally tenacious of their o|pinions, they could not come to an agreement: The matter, in di&s;pute, which re&s;pected their manner of voting conjunctly, and the executive powers exerci&s;ed by the A&s;&s;i&s;tants or Coun|&s;ellors during the rece&s;s of the General Court, were there|fore referred to the &s;erious con&s;ideration of their wi&s;e and holy Saints and Prophets the Par&s;ons, who&s;e determination was acquie&s;ced in by both Hou&s;es as they began to be &s;ick of the contention.</P>
<P>This &s;ame year they &s;till continued to per&s;ecute all tho&s;e who differed from them either in religious or political opinion. The celebrated Sir Henry Vane, afterwards beheaded for being one of the Regicides, in a letter to Governor Win|throp,

gently and &s;ea&s;onably reproves them for their oppre&s;|&s;ions and per&s;ecutions. As this letter is &s;hort, and as the o|pinions of &s;uch a great man are both curious and intere&s;ting, the whole letter &s;hall be given in the original orthography.</P>

<P>The mildne&s;s &s;hewn in this letter is the more remarkable, as Winthrop had forced Sir Henry Vane to leave the Colo|ny of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, and this letter was written when Sir Henry's intere&s;t in Parliament was very great.</P>
<P>Next year a complaint was exhibited in England again&s;t the Colony, by a number of members of the Church of England, for having taken the undue liberty of pre&s;enting a petition to the General Court of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, pray|ing,</P>
<P>That they might be allowed the free exerci&s;e of their re|ligion, according to their own mode of wor&s;hip:</P>
<P>That they might be freed from the heavy Taxes impo&s;ed upon them:</P>
<P>That they might be freed from the illegal impre&s;&s;es made of them, their children, and &s;ervants, into the war:</P>
<P>That the fundamental laws of England might be made the ba&s;is of their Government, according to the Charter:</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="014255_0091_0F93587E85C2F9C0">
That they might be &s;uffered to enjoy Civil and Religious Liberty.</P>
<P>This petition rou&s;ed the wrath of the Phari&s;ees and Ty|rants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets. The petitioners were apprehended, tried, and convicted of the High crime of pre&s;enting the pe|tition. Their hou&s;es were rifled, their papers &s;eized; Pro|phet Mather thundered reproaches again&s;t them from the pulpit, calling them Hamans, Juda&s;es, and &s;ons of Korah; he intreated the Lord to confound them, and then, as if he had received immediate in&s;piration from Heaven, he denoun|ced the judgments of God upon them. The con&s;equence of their conviction was, heavy fines and impri&s;onment, for the Saints of Bo&s;ton always had a precious regard for the money of tho&s;e they oppre&s;&s;ed; and they al&s;o &s;ecured their per&s;ons, that they might not have an opportunity to complain.</P>
<P>Some of the petitioners, however, made their e&s;cape, and drew up a repre&s;entation of their ca&s;e and &s;ufferings, to which they added the following queries:</P>
<P>Whether the patent of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets was confirmed by Parliament, and whether it was not nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be?</P>
<P>Whether the Court may forfeit their Charter?</P>
<P>Whether, if trea&s;on be uttered in the pulpit, or in the Court, and not que&s;tioned, the Court do not con&s;ent to that trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Whether it be not high trea&s;on, as well in New Eng|land as in Ireland, to endeavour to &s;ubvert the fundamental laws of England, to take away the liberties of the Engli&s;h nation, to &s;ay the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets is a free &s;tate?</P>
<P>Whether the oath of allegiance be not binding in New England?</P>
<P>Whether the Bo&s;ton mini&s;ters may publicly vilify the Eng|li&s;h nation and laws, and not be que&s;tioned?</P>
<P>Whether the petitioners ought to be hindered from &s;ettling in a church way, according to the churches in England?</P>
<P>From the above petition, and the queries &s;ubjoined to it, the tyrannic and rebellious acts of the venerable forefathers of the Bo&s;tonians clearly appear; and it may not be unne|ce&s;&s;ary to add, that the pre&s;ent traitors are worthy of &s;uch progenitors.</P>
<P>The Bo&s;ton hypocrites in&s;tructed their agent to make the be&s;t defence he could again&s;t the&s;e petitioners. The di&s;trac|ted &s;tate of England prevented any relief being granted the petitioners, or any regulation undertaken for the better go|vernment of that refractory Colony.</P>
<P>Soon after this, that tyrant, Governor Winthrop died, it
<PB N="91" REF="014255_0092_0F93587F78D15578">
was ob&s;erved, that at the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Colony he was of a more tolerant and catholic &s;pirit than many of his a&s;&s;ociates, but that every day he grew more contracted, bi|goted, and per&s;ecuting. Under the cover of religious zeal and per&s;ecution, he pu&s;hed all his political views. The man however had &s;ome virtues, the Bo&s;tonians called him the fa|ther of the country; and though he put in execution all their oppre&s;&s;ive &s;chemes, yet they at times both traduced and ca|lumniated him, which made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his mind. The year before his death the <HI>fir&s;t witch</HI> was executed. On his death-bed he was &s;truck with remor&s;e for his manifold oppre&s;&s;ions and cruelties, and gave &s;trong proof of it before he expired, by refu&s;ing the Lieutenant Governor, who was pre&s;&s;ing him much to &s;ign an order for the bani&s;hment of an heretic, &s;aying, <Q>He had done too much of that work al|ready.</Q></P>
<P>The mode&s;ty and the merit of &s;ome of the gentlemen who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avour us with their vi&s;its here from America are quite cap|tivating. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ome of them are exceedingly laborious in in&s;tructing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> politics, and daily a&s;&s;uring us, that if the Briti&s;h Parliament rai&s;es one &s;hilling in America, the ruin of Britain mu&s;t en&s;ue; others come with a Par&s;on in their train, and with uplifted eyes, and hands in mendicant &s;trains &s;upplicate the good people of England, liberally to be&s;tow their charity for the worthy purpo&s;e of fattening and enrich|ing &s;ome rogues of American projectors. The&s;e enterpri&s;ing gentlemen have no notion of confining their genius, for Way and means, to their own Hemi&s;phere; they are more adven|turous, and range the Globe in que&s;t of prey: To them a voyage of three thou&s;and miles to the land of good nature is the plea&s;ante&s;t of all employments; their heads teem with ideas of the riches they &s;hall acquire, and bags bur&s;ting wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> money <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before their eyes. Thus a Per&s;on Wheelock will plan a Connecticut Indian College, and detach to Eng|land a Whitaker, his confederate, along with his tawny In|dian Occum, whom he had taught to preach and to pray, as a juggler learns a dog to play at Cards, a Monkey to walk a minuet, or a Bear to dance a hornpipe, in order to levy contributions on the public. To &s;ee and hear a converted Heathen, a man in the colour of the Devil, &s;peaking Eng|li&s;h and &s;olemnly from the pulpit expounding the &s;acred o|racles, was altogether irre&s;i&s;table. The plan was well laid&mdash;well executed&mdash;had its effect&mdash;The White American preacher, and the Black American preacher, after having

ran&s;acked England, Scotland and Ireland, retreated happy with their plunder, leaving the inhabitants of three king|doms to wonder at their own folly. It would have &s;aved the deluded people of this country &s;ome thou&s;ands, if the &s;ooty intepreter of the Scriptures and his deceitful guide had met with the &s;ame fate which befel an ingenious Bo&s;tonian arti&s;t many years before their pious and profitable expediti|on. This arti&s;t toiled a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly a whole twelvemonth in carving an image in wood of the famous Mohawk, King Hendrick. When this great work was fini&s;hed it was the admiration of the Bo&s;tonians, and the ladies them&s;elves view|ed with rapture a naked male figure nine feet high, though &s;urrounded with the implements of riot, murder, and war. To have circum&s;cribed &s;uch a proof of genius, within the continent of Briti&s;h America, would have been extremely in|judicious; his own countrymen would gape and wonder, but they never willingly part with the Ca&s;h Warm there|fore with hopes of an immen&s;e fortune, he embarked for England, and in due time arrived at Plymouth, landed his wooden monarch, and di&s;tributed his hand bills; but O dire misfortune! there happened to be a hot pre&s;s. Mr Wel&s;h being threatened to be laid hold of as a vagrant, and forced <HI>again&s;t his con&s;ent</HI> to &s;erve his living Maje&s;ty King George the &s;econd, in&s;tead of voluntarily exhibiting his decea&s;ed Maje&s;ty King Hendrick of America, thought proper to de|camp. But it would be great inju&s;tice to the Americans to re&s;t all their merits on their Indian preachers and their car|vers of images; they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many other talents; they are Merchants or Miners, whenever they meet with any credulous gentlemen that will &s;ell them goods, for which they never will pay, or who will purcha&s;e of them &s;hares of New England Mines, to the amount of &s;everal thou&s;ands of pounds, which Mines never will be worked. This will, no doubt, both &s;urpri&s;e and &s;hock many gentlemen, who have within the&s;e three la&s;t years, advanced con&s;iderable &s;ums to a &s;uppo&s;ed American Mine proprietor. The Mines lay no where but in his tongue, and with that he undermined them. It is true, he produced &s;pecimens of rich ore, but it was ea|&s;y, to &s;peak in Doctor Franklin's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to <HI>"obtain"</HI> rich &s;pecimens of ore, and much ea&s;ier too, than to <HI>"obtain"</HI> private letters; for the &s;pecimens of ore might be purcha&s;ed in five thou&s;and places, but the <HI>Letters</HI> could only be taken from one place. But to return to the Creator of Mines, though really a thick &s;kulled fellow, he po&s;&s;e&s;t infinite ver&s;a|tility, a great &s;hare of low cunning, and no blu&s;h ever dawn|ed
<PB N="93" REF="014255_0094_0F935880A46327B0">
on his impudent countenance. He was proprietor of all &s;orts of Mines: If the per&s;on he was treating with wi&s;hed to purcha&s;e a &s;hare in a Copper Mine, he had the riche&s;t in the world; if another cho&s;e a Silver Mine, the an&s;wer was the &s;ame; tho&s;e who were for Lead or Gold, were al&s;o accom|modated: whether in London or in the Country, he diffu&s;|ed general &s;atisfaction; and, in a &s;maller degree, the South Sea and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi &s;chemes were revived. In confirmation of all he &s;aid, his rich &s;pecimens were &s;hewn, and he left his fooli&s;h purcha&s;ers indulging in golden dreams, whil&s;t he re|tired with their real property. With merchants he was a merchant, which &s;ome will unhappily feel the effects of. In his tour through this i&s;land he happened, at a large manu|factoring Town, to meet in company a Merchant, who in|tended to retire from trade as &s;oon as he could &s;ell off his &s;tock: The moment our Miner heard this, he was one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive merchants in America; he dealt in every thing, and could di&s;po&s;e of any thing: Thus, the Merchant being ready to &s;ell, and the Miner as ready to buy, a bargain was &s;oon &s;truck, and all the ware&punc;hou&s;e full of goods, to a very great amount, was packed up, old and new, whole&s;ale and retail: They were immediately after &s;hipped for America, but the remittances are yet to come. What has been given above is with the be&s;t intention of informing the public of &s;ome pa&s;t impo&s;itions upon them, and that they be guarded again&s;t any pre&s;ent or future deceptions To build and en|dow a College for the in&s;truction of youth, the advancement of knowledge, and the general good of a very di&s;tant coun|try, would, no doubt be a noble and laudable act, provided we could afford the expence, and al&s;o provided the people preaching and praying for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance were objects de&s;erv|ing our regard The amazing &s;ucce&s;s of the Reverend White Mr. Whitaker, and the Reverend Black Mr. Occum, has at this pre&s;ent time allured into this kingdom two gentlemen from Philadelphia, a Phy&s;ical Dr William&s;on,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This Doctor was one of the Sage advi&s;ers to the de&s;tructi|on of the Tea at Bo&s;ton, and was rewarded with a gratis pa&s;|&s;age to England in one of their Patriots &s;hips.</HI></NOTE> and a cur|&s;e of Souls the Reverend Mr. Ewing. The important bu&s;i|ne&s;s which the&s;e gentlemen have taken the trouble to vi&s;it us upon, is, that at Philadelphia, Dr. Franklin's re&s;idence, when in America, they have an inclination to build a Col|lege, and to endow it; they do not want learned men and Profe&s;&s;ors, for the&s;e are already prepared among&s;t them&s;elves;
<PB N="94" REF="014255_0095_0F9358819BBE8618">
they only want magnificent apartments and good &s;alaries; and to obtain the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary comforts of life, they have bold|ly ri&s;ked the dangers of the Atlantic On week days, the Phy&s;ical gentleman is to talk us out of our money, if he can; and on Sundays the Reverend gentleman is to preach us out of it, if he can. The American AE&s;cu&s;apius is the leader and conductor of this great, wi&s;e, and mode&s;t expedition; and of all men among&s;t the loyal and dutiful inhabitants of Philadelphia, one more unfit could not have been found. He may, perhaps, be quite profound in his profe&s;&s;ion, but however that may be, he is almighty in politics: He holds it as incontrovertible, that England has no authority over the Colonies: He talks with a &s;neer of contempt of the di|minutivene&s;s of this I&s;land, and with a tone of authority of the va&s;t magnitude of America; he &s;peaks with feigned re|gret of the approaching downfall of Britain, and, with an air of protection and triumph, offers its inhabitants &s;helter in the Colonies; and, notwith&s;tanding all this, he thinks that he acts with the greate&s;t prudence and circum&s;pection, becau&s;e he does not conde&s;cend to enter into an argument: Rea&s;on he will not; but after delivering his &s;entiments with oracu|lar pompo&s;ity, he gathers him&s;elf up in his chair with an air of the greate&s;t importance, erects his head, and looks over his long no&s;e at the re&s;t of the company, with a &s;erenity and dignity of countenance only becoming a Gulliver amid&s;t his Lilleputians. Thus the loyal and con&s;i&s;tent Con&s;tituents of Doctor Franklin, at Philadelphia, who deny the authority of our &s;upreme Legi&s;lature, who refu&s;e to contribute a farth|ing towards their own protection, who call us tyrants and plunderers, and who, at this very time, are e&s;tabli&s;hing ille|gal Po&s;t-Offices, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of Government, that they may lay their hands on all our letters private as well as public, have &s;ent over a couple of their wi&s;e and holy men to abu&s;e us to our faces, and then to beg our money; which obtained, they will retire to their beloved America, and there with their a&s;&s;ociates, they will wanton in luxury at the ex|pence of Engli&s;h Genero&s;ity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Ye&s;terday, as I am informed, Mr. Coddington had &s;omething done for him at the Council of State; which I believe was his Patent confirmed. The truth is, &s;ince I perceived by letters from Plymouth, that, after another years warning, nothing is likely to be done in reference to the old order of the Lords and Commons &s;ent over in 1647, as I take it, I looked upon it as a vain thing to &s;trive a|gain&s;t the &s;tream, when as indeed that was the material main objection, above a twelvemonth &s;ince; and if I could not then an&s;wer it, how much le&s;s now, after another year if not eighteen months expiration; but the will of the Lord mu&s;t be done! However, I &s;uffer in my reputation here; to make &s;o great a bu&s;tle at fir&s;t, and then to let all fall at la&s;t; had I not received particular in&s;tructions from Plymouth herein, I had never &s;tirred in it; but I &s;hall be more wary hereafter, how I engage in bu&s;ine&s;s of that nature; yet, when I have &s;aid it, &s;hall not dare to neglect the lea&s;t &s;ervice wherein any or all of the United Colonies are concerned.</P>
<P>Here is great murmuring at the great provi&s;ion of pow|der and &s;hot; the &s;everal &s;hins get licence for, year after

year, forty barrels of powder, and fifty barrels is an ordi|nary proportion to a &s;hip, nay &s;ometimes a hundred, and lead and arms proportionable.</P>
<P>It is laid to our charge, that, being Cu&s;tom free, we enrich our&s;elves by furni&s;hing Barbadoes and Virginia, though enemies, with that and other commodities; and there hath been, on that very account, a &s;erious debate about revoking our free Cu&s;tom and Exci&s;e.</P>
<P>I have laboured in it, and &s;atisfied many of the Parli|ament and Council of State of your care not to &s;uffer any powder, more than &s;hips &s;tore, to be tran&s;ported away; that we are fain to land all we bring hither, for fear of firing the &s;hips in the river, and we mu&s;t get licen&s;e for that al&s;o, upon return; that the Ma&s;ter is forced to take licen&s;e for more than he buys, that he may bear out his pa&s;&s;engers particular &s;tores.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewed them, that we only had &s;uffered with and for them; and, for their &s;akes, were hated of all the Engli&s;h abroad.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>By this authentic letter we find, that the confederated New England Colonies paid as little re&s;pect to the orders of the Lords and Commons, during the time of the Common|wealth, as they now pay to Acts of Parliament. The or|ders of the Lords were, to &s;end home their Patent for a re|newal, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> an acknowledgment of the powers then in being; and that all proce&s;&s;es in the Colony &s;hould be in the name of the Keepers of the Liberties of England The refractory In|dependents of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, however, complied with neither of the&s;e orders.</P>
<P>If this Agents of theirs was not the mo&s;t clear and di&s;tinct writer, at lea&s;t he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> regard for
<PB N="97" REF="014255_0098_0F935884E655B880">
his reputation, and a due &s;en&s;e of honour, by his complaints of the conduct of his con&s;tituents, even to them&s;elves: But rightly judging that his injured character would receive no reparation from them, like an hone&s;t &s;en&s;ible man, he de|clares he will be more cautious, in future, how he under|takes any bu&s;ine&s;s for them, and then, like a good Chri&s;tian, re&s;ts his ca&s;e with the Lord.</P>
<P>Indeed, whenever their Agents implicitly followed their directions, they always involved them in fal&s;ehoods, in dirty work, and in di&s;grace. They never were &s;o well provided in that re&s;pect as they are at pre&s;ent; they have got a coun|try-man of their own, and one of a mind congenial with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>At this period of time Barbadoes and Virginia held out a|gain&s;t the Commonwealth, yet we find that the Bo&s;tonians &s;upplied them with powder, &s;hot, and arms, which occa&s;ion|ed &s;erious debates in Parliament, and the Council of State, about revoking their free cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>By their Charter they were only freed from paying or yielding any cu&s;tom or &s;ub&s;idy, either inward or outward, for the &s;pace of &s;even years, from its date, which was March the 4th, 1629, &s;o that their exemption from cu&s;toms and &s;ub&s;idies was expired about fifteen years.</P>
<P>Their Agent &s;eems to have made a very ingenious excu&s;e for their exporting &s;uch great quantities of powder and o|ther warlike &s;tores, but unluckily happened to be mi&s;taken; for the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the United Colonies confe&s;s, in their reply, dated September 11th, in the &s;ame year, <Q>with re&s;pect to the trade of powder, we cannot but fear it hath been too exorbitantly managed by &s;ome, though the wel|fare of the Colonies in many re&s;pects are deeply concerned and hazarded.</Q></P>
<P>If they were hated, as they tell us them&s;elves, in the la&s;t century, by all the Engli&s;h abroad, it may be &s;aid with the greate&s;t truth, that in our days, their general character is univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed over all the Continent of Briti&s;h Ameri|ca. Though the other Colonies will confederate with them again&s;t the payment of taxes, yet that does not obliterate the contempt and dete&s;tation which they entertain for the hypo|critical Saints of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>Their Agent takes leave with a very proper admonition to the merchants, not to abu&s;e the freedom which they enjoyed, and prays GOD to direct them. In&s;tead of taking his ad|vice, they continued to break through all re&s;traint, and have till this hour continued refractory and rebellious.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>IN the days of Oliver, the Bo&s;tonian Phari&s;ees and oppre&s;|&s;ors out canted that long practi&s;ed and through paced Hypocrite him&s;elf. As they &s;tiled them&s;elves the family of God wre&s;tling with the wants of a wilderne&s;s, in the ends of the earth, Cromwell took compa&s;&s;ion upon them, and having entirely conquered Ireland he was very de&s;irous of removing the dear Saints of God, from their barren de&s;arts, to the Iri&s;h Canaan, which he had ju&s;t &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion the Bo&s;tonian Hypocrites were caught in their own &s;nare Their complaints, concerning their poor and mean condition, were not de&s;igned to obtain a removal and a new &s;ettlement, but were intended to impre&s;s the &s;tate with an opinion of their poverty, in order that they might pre&s;erve them&s;elves from paying Cu&s;toms and Taxes, as the years of their exemption from both, by their Patent, were long expired.</P>
<P>The Family of God having thus, by their hypocritical whimpering, brought them&s;elves into &s;uch a dilemma, they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;embling together, for the mor|tifying purpo&s;e of contradicting all their pa&s;t repre&s;entations, on purpo&s;e to prevent their re-tran&s;portation.

Suppo&s;ing Oliver really to be an Enthu&s;ia&s;t, the General Court of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets &s;et out very artfully; they pre|tend, that through the holine&s;s of their life they had obtain|ed great influence with the Almighty, the God of Battles, and that out of Gratitude for Oliver's tender care of them, they would u&s;e their intere&s;t with Jehovah, that all his great and godly undertakings might pro&s;per. Setting a&s;ide the bla&s;phemous impudence of this preten&s;ion&mdash;what could be better calculated to gain the favour of a religious and mili|tary Enthu&s;ia&s;t?</P>
<P>It has always been the practice of the people of the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ets, when the &s;tate here undertook to regulate them, to &s;ay, that the information, upon which Government pro|ceeded, was given by their enemies, when, in truth, it was founded on their own authentic publications and public acts. At this time, however, it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to deny all that they had publi&s;hed of the barrenne&s;s of the wilderne&s;s they inhabited, that they might, with the better grace, de|cline the invitation given them of tran&s;planting them&s;elves to Ireland.</P>
<P>Now, therefore, the barren d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;art was in&s;tantly transform|ed into a land flowing with milk and honey. God had ble&s;|&s;ed them with plenty of food of all kinds, and that in &s;uch &s;uperabundance, that they yearly exported thou&s;ands of bu&s;h|els of grain, and other provi&s;ions of beef and pork. They could &s;upport all their aged, their &s;ick, and their poor. They could afford to re-e&s;tabli&s;h all tho&s;e who &s;uffered by fire, or other accidents, by contributions. So that poverty could not truly be alleged as a rea&s;on for tran&s;planting them. The pre&s;ent Hypocrites and Rebels of Bo&s;ton proceed exactly in the &s;ame manner at this time. When Parliament lays a tax upon them, they cry out bitterly, that <Q>the Revenue Officers are devouring mon&s;ters, who &s;uck their very life blood while it is &s;treaming from their veins;</Q> and yet, &s;oon after, they tell us, with an air of di&s;dain, <Q>that Par|liament had better repeal the Tax, as the duty does not pay the expence of rai&s;ing it.</Q> A Bo&s;tonian never minds what contradictions and fal&s;ehoods he utters, provided he can carry his point.</P>
<P>As to the Liberties of the Go&s;pel, they might have enjoy|ed them in as great purity in Ireland.</P>
<P>It is true, that they maintained all their Ordinances, both in Church and Commonwealth, by fining, impri&s;oning, whipping, bani&s;hing, or hanging, all who di&s;&s;ented form
<PB N="101" REF="014255_0102_0F93588766307958">
them in matters either civil or religious; which was their method of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing errors in judgment.</P>
<P>Previous to Cromwell's invitation, whil&s;t they were mur|dering the Indians for the &s;ake of their lands, they always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bewaild their own dangerous &s;ituation, expo&s;ed, as they were, to the ravages and cruelties of the barbarous Heathen Savages; but now, when a propo&s;al was made for their removal to Ireland, where there were no Indians, and where they could live in &s;afety, the&s;e bloody Barbarians of Indians were, in a moment, converted to the Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; they could read and write Engli&s;h comforta|bly; and they could al&s;o pray and prophecy, in a comforta|ble manner, with great gravity, reverence, and zeal.</P>
<P>As the Commonwealth Parliament had, at this very time, ordered, that all proce&s;&s;es &s;hould be in their name, and that the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Patent &s;hould be &s;urrendered, and a renew|al of it accepted, as a proof of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Colony to their authority; the dear Saints of God inclo&s;ed, in their letter to Oliver, a copy of their petition to Parliament, in which they refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to either to the&s;e orders, &s;ay|ing, that they did not di&s;cern the need of obeying &s;uch in|junctions: In order to ward off puni&s;hment for &s;uch an a|vowed di&s;obedience, they be&s;eech Oliver to u&s;e his intere&s;t in their behalf, that the Work of God in the Wilderne&s;s might not be ob&s;tructed, and, in return they promi&s;e their intere&s;t with the Captain of the Ho&s;t of I&s;rael, the God of Armies. Whether Cromwell, on account of this pretended intere&s;t with the God of Battles, gave up his own project, and u&s;ed his influence with the Parliament, or whether the civil war, which &s;till continued, and the other very important objects they were engaged in, diverted their attention, cannot be &s;aid po&s;itively,&mdash;but as to this period we hear no more of tran&s;planting the Saints to Ireland, or of recalling their Pa|tent.</P>
<P>IF your corre&s;pondent, who &s;igns him&s;elf a White man, had attended to the very fir&s;t line of the Speculation relative to American Adventurers, he would not have charged the Writer with general reflections on a whole country; for in that fir&s;t line, the mode&s;ty and merit of <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the Ameri|can gentlemen are mentioned; now <HI>&s;ome</HI> cannot mean the <HI>whole,</HI> and therefore cannot be a general reflection. It is readily allowed, that there are many gentlemen of integrity, abilities, and loyalty, in the various parts of Briti&s;h Ameri|ca, and e&s;pecially in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets; but it is as certain,
<PB N="102" REF="014255_0103_0F9358881B9AB238">
that, at Bo&s;ton, the&s;e very great and good qualities render them objects of factious rage and per&s;ecution. Of this we have a recent in&s;tance in the treatment of Judge Oliver, who&s;e firmne&s;s, integrity, and abilities, would do honour to the fir&s;t citizen of any country.</P>
<P>Concerning the money-collecting expedition of the Reve|rend triumvirate, the two White Par&s;ons and the Black one, their de&s;ign in rai&s;ing contributions might be pious, but the u&s;efulne&s;s of it may be doubted The American Clergy have been drawing money from this good natured country for more than a century pa&s;t, for the laudible purpo&s;e of Go&s;|pelizing the Heathen, and they have indulged us, at la&s;t, with the &s;ingle and &s;ingular exhibition of that Reverend Di|vine Indian, the Sooty Mr. Occum. After all, it is not &s;o much the mi&s;application of the money when collected, that is found fault with, as the folly of our having contributed to it.&mdash;Re&s;pecting that "ingenius Impo&s;tor," the Miner, your corre&s;pondent of Saturday is probably mi&s;taken, with regard to that rogue's having no recommendations; for it is a cer|tain fact, that he was fitted out by that wi&s;e head of the Fac|tion, Mr. Hancock, who al&s;o complimented him with the u&s;e of the cabbin of one of his ve&s;&s;els bound to this country: So that we are obliged to that great Bo&s;ton patriot for whatever honour and advantage we received from the vi&s;it of his town&s;|man, the American Phoenomenon. If we had money to &s;pare, if the Americans were dutiful, if all our own poor were only provided with bread, exclu&s;ive of learning, Doctor William|&s;on and his Reverend Companion (who is really a good &s;ort of man) might have &s;ome plea for a&s;king &s;ub&s;criptions to|wards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a "Seminary of Literature" at Philadelphia: But circum&s;tanced as we are at pre&s;ent&mdash;Ame|rica in rebellion, our&s;elves bending under the heavy load of taxes incurred in defence of America, and numbers of the mo&s;t indu&s;trious members of our community, with their fa|milies, begging in the &s;treets&mdash;in &s;uch a &s;ituation to part with our money, on purpo&s;e to in&s;titute a &s;eminary of litera|ture in America, would not be a proof of our genero&s;ity and wi&s;dom, but of our blindne&s;s and folly.&mdash;That the money, when collected, would be applied to the purpo&s;e for which it was rai&s;ed, need not be doubted: It is not the mi&s;appli|cation of the money, but the collection of it which is dread|ed. It is true that the Doctor and his Reverend companion are out of England, becau&s;e they are at pre&s;ent in Scotland, no doubt with an intent, as the General A&s;&s;embly is now &s;it|ing, to procure its &s;anction and recommendation to the Cler|gy
<PB N="103" REF="014255_0104_0F935888D55A2BD8">
of the different pari&s;hes throughout that kingdom, that collections may be made in all the Churches, as was the ca&s;e in Whitaker and Occum's expedition. But if the Scotch, amid&s;t the wreck of their affairs, and whil&s;t their very Banks are becoming bankrupt, contribute a farthing towards the Doctor's &s;cheme, we ought to rebuild the Roman wall, and confine them with their folly and their paper credit, to their own barren mountains That men, &s;uppo&s;ed to have com|mon &s;en&s;e &s;hould plan &s;uch an excur&s;ion, and think to &s;uc|ceed, con&s;idering our pre&s;ent &s;ituation with regard to Ame|rica is really unaccountable and marvelous. The Ameri|cans refu&s;e to contribute either to their own protection, or to the &s;upport of the State; and yet they &s;end off a party to beg our money for the in&s;titution of a College. If all was right in America, it would be but ju&s;t in us to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, even if by that a&s;&s;i&s;tance we &s;hould be put to &s;ome difficulties our|&s;elves. That &s;uch time may &s;oon arrive mu&s;t be the &s;incere wi&s;h of every good &s;ubject. When peace and unanimity are re&s;tored, every individual in the Mother Country will mani|fe&s;t their affection for the Colonies; for the genero&s;ity and humanity of the Engli&s;h nation are boundle&s;s as the hea|vens.</P>
<P>THE Saints profe&s;&s;ing loyalty and godline&s;s at Bo&s;ton, &s;end us, by every ve&s;&s;el from their Port, accumulated proofs of their trea&s;ons and rebellions. That mighty wi&s;e Patriot, Mr. John Hancock, from the old South Meeting Hou&s;e, has lately repeated a ha&s;h of abu&s;ive, trea&s;onable &s;tuff, compo&s;ed for him by the joint efforts of the Reverend Divine Samuel Cooper, that Ro&s;e of Sharon, and by the very hone&s;t Samuel Adams, Clerk, P&s;alm-finger, Purlonier, and Curer of Ba|con. This great and honourable Ma&s;ter Hancock is very well known in London to many; indeed, unfortunately for them, too well known; for they would now e&s;teem them&s;elves happy, if they had never heard of him before this fran|tic Oration. When he was in London about twelve years ago, he was the laughing-&s;tock and the contempt of all his acquaintances: in&s;tead of attending and pu&s;hing his mercantile intere&s;t, vi&s;iting the different curio&s;ities in and a|bout Town, and forming reputable connections, as a young man of his great fortune ought to have done, he kept &s;neak|ing and lurking about the kitchen of his uncle's corre&s;pon|dent, drank tea every day with the hou&s;e-maid, and on Sun|days e&s;corted her to White Conduit Hou&s;e. People unacquain|ted with Mr. Hancock's natural condition thought, that his

clo&s;e attendance and attention aro&s;e from an amorous con|nection; but his old &s;chool-fellows and intimates knew, that though nature had be&s;towed upon him a human figure, &s;he had denied him the powers of manhood. The girl was therefore in perfect &s;afety, though uncon&s;cious of it. The &s;en&s;e of his incapacity could not however hinder him from thinking; perhaps the Fair Sex took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his head, and no doubt he loved them as well as he was able. When he arrived in America, his uncle, who knew his weakne&s;s and want of capacity, kept him at a di&s;tance form company; but as &s;oon as he died, Flatterers, Rogues, and Knaves of all ages and all profe&s;&s;ions, flocked about him, as Vultures, Cormorants, and Carrion Crows flock abaut a dead Carc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e: It is a melancholy con&s;ideration, that good natured folly &s;hould be plundered and &s;tript by &s;uch a ne&s;t of Villains as he a&s;&s;ociates with. His fortune has long been in the wane. Such is the character, and &s;uch the &s;ituation of this &s;imple Creature, who has been per&s;uaded to form the extravagant &s;cheme of conquering England in the Pulpit of the Old South, and in the De&s;k of the Bo&s;ton Town Hall. This Bo&s;tonian Orator &s;ets out with telling the &s;editious Starers and Gapers around him, with what awe, their attentive gravity, their ve|nerable appearance, and the dignity on their countenances, &s;truck him! It will readily be believed that they were very attentive to their own prai&s;e, with which it mu&s;t be &s;aid he plentifully bepla&s;tered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; but it may be &s;u&s;pected, that the venerable appearances were nothing more than the grins of grey headed folly. As to this dignity in their countenan|ces, it would have been an entertaining and highly ludicrous &s;ight, to have &s;een the grea&s;y rebellious Rogues &s;welling them&s;elves up, and &s;truggling to a&s;&s;ume an air of con&s;equence. We agree with the Orator, when he confe&s;&s;es his want of a|bility and unworthine&s;s, which is one of the few truths in his traiterous Oration. This &s;peechifying Fool a&s;&s;ures his Rebel Audience, that it would be to the la&s;t degree vicious and infamous in them to attempt to &s;upport the Government of England; that a traiterous plot is devi&s;ed by the mother country again&s;t them; that Great Britain has omitted no means of procuring their de&s;truction; that Great Britain has declared &s;he has full power to make laws of &s;ufficient va|lidity to bind the Colonies; that &s;he has exerci&s;ed this pre|tended right by impo&s;ing on them a Tax; that &s;he has &s;ent her fleets and armies to enforce her mad preten&s;ions; that he him&s;elf glories in publicly avowing his eternal enimity to Briti&s;h tyranny; that he prays perpetual infamy may be en|tailed
<PB N="105" REF="014255_0106_0F93588A56D1ACC0">
upon that villain who advi&s;ed the execrable mea&s;ure of taxing them, and of &s;ending troops to enforce obedience to Acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament, which neither God nor man ever empowered them to make: That the Soldiers were unfeeling ruffians, who viciated their morals&mdash;who broke in upon their &s;olemn devotions in their temples, on the day hallowed by Heaven, and &s;et apart by God him&s;elf for his peculiar wor&s;hip&mdash;who taught their youth idlene&s;s and luxury, extravagance and effeminacy; and that he was compelled to acknowledge that even the noble&s;t, faire&s;t part of all the lower creation did not entirely e&s;cape the &s;nare.&mdash;Such a train of fal&s;ehood, madne&s;s, and rebellion, needs neither commentary nor explanation. The ringleaders ought to be taken up, and hanged round their own Town Hall; and, if there is a man in this kingdom &s;o infamous, and &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of loyalty, as to &s;tand forth their champion, he ought to be treated as the parricide of his country.</P>
<P>When Orator Hancock, the nominal head, yet the wretch|ed and plundered tool of the Bo&s;ton rebels, charged the Ar|my with en&s;naring their wives and daughters, he ought to have e&s;tabli&s;hed the fact, by producing, at lea&s;t, one evi|dence of the truth of it; but the truth is, that this a&s;per&s;ion was only thrown out to abu&s;e the troops, and to keep up the aver&s;ion of the people; for &s;o far from giving the Officers and Soldiers acce&s;s to their hou&s;es, their wives, and their daugh|ters, the factious profe&s;&s;ing Saints would not even provide a|ny kind of quarters for the regiments&mdash;no, not even a cover|ing, not a common &s;hed, from the inclemencies of the wea|ther. After a long, de&s;ultory, fal&s;e, and trea&s;onable pre|amble, the <HI>prompted idiotic Orator</HI> proceeds to the tran&s;ac|tion which occa&s;ioned his appearance in the pulpit of Rebel|lion, <Q>on that di&s;mal night when Hell was &s;uffered to take the reins, when Satan, with his cho&s;en band, opened the &s;luices of New England's blood, and &s;acraligiou&s;ly pollut|ed the land with the dead bodies of her guiltle&s;s Sons.</Q> The&s;e guiltle&s;s &s;ons were five of the faction, who a&s;&s;embled with many hundereds of their confederate rebels, to drive the &s;oldiers out of town, and to plunder the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e che&s;t of all the Revenue rai&s;ed in America. One of them, who lived &s;ome days after he was wounded, repeatedly and &s;olemnly declared, on his death bed, that he had often &s;een riots in Ireland, but that he had never in his life time &s;een &s;oldiers &s;uffer &s;uch a violence of attack, and &s;uch an extre|mity of bad u&s;age &s;o long, without firing. In &s;hort, the
<PB N="106" REF="014255_0107_0F93588B1FD3FEB8">
whole was a villianous plot of the faction; they imagined that the troops would not dare to fire without the orders of a magi&s;trate, and therefor, that they would be able to turn them out of Town without any danger. The&s;e guiltle&s;s Sons had knocked down &s;ome of the &s;oldiers, were wre&s;ting their mu&s;kets from them, and were pu&s;hing into the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e at the time they were fired at; and one of the&s;e glori|ous, immortal, free-born &s;ons of New-England, was an able bodied Moiatto &s;lave. The faction at Bo&s;ton, although they had fomented and conducted the in&s;urrection and attack on his Maje&s;ty's troops and Cu&s;tom hou&s;e, yet they endeavour|ed, by the evidence and perjuries of upwards of fifty of the rioters them&s;elves, to e&s;tabli&s;h a proof that the &s;oldiers were the aggre&s;&s;ors; but the perjuries were &s;o contradictory, bare|faced, and glaring, that they failed in this their wicked at|tempt. Upon this failure they tried another attrocious vil|lainy, which was to prove again&s;t &s;ome Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Offi|cers, that during the a&s;&s;ault on the troops, &s;everal of the Officers had fired on the rioters from the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e win|dows, and for this damnable purpo&s;e they &s;uborned &s;everal of their adherents to perjure them&s;elves; and likewi&s;e by threats, impri&s;onment, and promi&s;es of reward, &s;o intimi|dated a &s;ervant of one of the Revenue Officers, as to oblige him to &s;wear that his Ma&s;ter, and &s;everal others, fired from the windows of the Board of Cu&s;toms. But all the&s;e &s;ub|orned and perjured evidences were controverted, in the clear|e&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner, by po&s;itive proofs being brought that the Officers charged, were long before the time of the firing, at the time of the firing, and long after it, at a hou&s;e half a mile di&s;tant from the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e: other witne&s;s a proved, that the Officers were not in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e that night; and be&s;ides, &s;everal of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable merchants in Bo&s;ton, one of whom was &s;hot through the arm, gave in evidence, <HI>"that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ully &s;atisfied no &s;uch fir|ing could have happened while the &s;oldiers were there, with|out their ob&s;erving it; that they &s;tood oppo&s;ite to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e in full view of it, from the time the &s;oldiers fir&s;t came down there, until all the guns were di&s;charged; that they were &s;atisfied the whole firing was from the &s;treet, and that all above was quiet."</HI> This &s;trong, &s;ub&s;tantial, exculpatory proof was undeniable, more e&s;pecially as the &s;ubornation of perjury was po&s;itively proved again&s;t a principal leader of the faction; in con&s;equence of which, the principal evidence again&s;t the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers, was &s;entenced to be whipt at the public whipping po&s;t.

<P>SOME time after the people of New England had decline|ed tran&s;planting them&s;elves to Ireland, Cromwell con|quered Jamaica; and upon this acqui&s;ition, he again invit|ed the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets to remove and &s;ettle on that i&s;land; but the People of the Lord remained firm in their determination not to depart out of their own I&s;rael.</P>

had its tendency to overthrow the <HI>man</HI> of <HI>&s;in.</HI> The&s;e inge|nious rea&s;ons, however, had no effect on the Saints; their Agent an&s;wered, that the body of the people, all things con&s;idered, lived more comfortably like Engli&s;hmen than any of the re&s;t of the Plantations. There was now to talk of their Poverty in the howling Wilderne&s;s. Whil&s;t Crom|well and the Agent were canva&s;&s;ing this matter together, a Member of the Council of State came in, and hearing the conver&s;ation re&s;pecting New England, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf greatly again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rigidne&s;s and per&s;ecutions there, and thought that his Highne&s;s ought to interpo&s;e his authority.</P>
<P>At this time many complaints were made to the Protector again&s;t the Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, for their violent and un|ju&s;t encroachments and u&s;urpations on their neighbours, par|ticularly in the ea&s;tern parts adjacent to New England, where they had forcibly &s;eized lands and provinces, which had been previou&s;ly granted to others by Patent.</P>
<P>In the General Court's letter to Oliver, excu&s;ing them&s;elves from removing to Jamaica, they &s;eemed to be aware of the&s;e <HI>ju&s;t complaints,</HI> which they &s;tiled according to their pre&s;ent me|thod, <HI>clamours</HI> and <HI>calumnies;</HI> and they promi&s;ed Oliver never to cea&s;e praying for him, provided he continued to be|lieve all they &s;aid, and to befriend them.</P>
<P>They al&s;o wrote a letter to Mr. Hopkins, a gentleman in great favour with Oliver, a&s;&s;uring him, that though they had not hitherto returned him their grateful acknowledgments for the many &s;ingular expre&s;&s;ions of his faithful love, yet their be&s;t de&s;ires at the throne of grace had not been wanting to implore a rich recompence of reward on his head and heart, as well as on many others whom the Lord had &s;tirred up to wi&s;h well to his exiled ones in the&s;e parts; that they were not without hope that the Lord would more and more en|courage him, according to the mercies he received; and that the Lord, who was and would be a rich payma&s;ter in the end, put into his hands opportunities of acting for his &s;ervice whil&s;t here. They then beg his continued helpfulne&s;s and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Leveret, their Agent, in promoting their affairs with his Highne&s;s the Lord Protector, and his honourable Council, and conclude with telling him, that they offer up daily prayers for his pro&s;perity.</P>

<P>As their u&s;urpations were numerous, &s;o were the repre&s;en|tations again&s;t them. This occa&s;ioned the General Court to draw up in&s;tructions to their Agent, &s;ome of which are as follow:</P>

<P>This has generally been the only an&s;wer they made to the many complaints brought again&s;t them.

Yet this Gentleman, whom they had &s;o illiberally and unju&s;tly treated, and voted an enemy to their Town, Province, and Continent, they have received with the utmo&s;t demon&s;trations of re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. In|deed, on his fir&s;t appointment, ab&s;tracted from his intimate and thorough knowledge of the Bo&s;tonians it was thought a fine &s;troke of Policy, and a puni&s;hment in it&s;elf, in his Ma|je&s;ty to make choice of a Gentleman to pre&s;ide over that re|bellious Province, which had &s;o unju&s;tly abu&s;ed him. Tho&s;e who were be&s;t acquainted with the di&s;po&s;ition of the Bo&s;ton Faction, and who have a regular corre&s;pondence with many in that Colony, though they never imagined that the Bo&s;to|nians would re&s;i&s;t unto blood, yet they as little thought that the new Governor would be received with every appearance of joy and exultation, and that he would be complimented, and treated at the expence of the rebellious Saints. Many &s;en&s;ible people in England were afraid that &s;ome blood would be &s;hed on the arrival of General Gage; for they had no conception that people de&s;cended, from Engli&s;hmen would, after &s;o many dreadful rhodomontadoes, &s;hrink into Boba|dils: They were led into this mi&s;take by not knowing the education which the Holy Warriors of Bo&s;ton receive in their youth; the generality of the young Bo&s;tonians are bred up hypocrites in religion, and pettifoggers in law, mo&s;t of them are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Bible, and a Provincial Law Book,
<PB N="116" REF="014255_0117_0F93589BA1226FE8">
and it is well known, that whenever hypocri&s;y takes root, and is further &s;upported by a con&s;tant practice of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t infamous chicaneries, common to petty practition|ers in law, that all the good and manly qualities given us by nature are &s;oon eradicated. The mo&s;t ancient Patriarch of New England, the Rev.

Neither is any reflection meant again&s;t the &s;tudy of the law: it is a noble, liberal profe&s;&s;ion; and men of character ought not to be blamed, becau&s;e they cannot keep knaves out of the prac|tice of it.</P>
<P>THE Writers in defence of the Bo&s;tonians, finding their News-paper publications to have very little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, have now changed their method of procedure, and attack us in &s;hilling and eighteen-penny pamphlets. One of tho&s;e ingenious pro|ductions the author has thought proper to entitle, <Q>A Speech intended to have been &s;poken on the Bill for alter|ing the Charter of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay;</Q> and he has al|&s;o cho&s;en to circulate a report, that the intended Speaker was, that Right Reverend Father in God the Bi&s;hop of St A&s;aph, who la&s;t year, to the utter a&s;toni&s;hment of the Society for the propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign parts, delivered to them, from the pulpit of St. Mary le Bow, a factious politi|cal &s;ermon, in&s;tead of informing them of the progre&s;s of the Church of England in America, and in&s;tead of in&s;tructing them by an illu&s;tration of that portion of Scripture which he had taken for his text. It is, however, more probable, that the intended Speech is the fruits of the midnight labours of the great and loyal Doctor Franklin, who has only played off the Bi&s;hop upon us, as a literary deception, in order to give the greater currency and weight to his own wild reveries and lucubrations. The rea&s;ons for imputing this intended &s;peech to Doctor Franklin are, that it contains all that low cunning which &s;o peculiarly marks his writings; that affected mode|ration; that feigned regard for peace; that compa&s;&s;ion for the madne&s;s of Britain in refu&s;ing to humble her neck to the feet of the Bo&s;tonian rebels; that grave impudence, which always places America in the light of a &s;eparate, independent, powerful State; that fal&s;e prophecying, which croaks out

<P>THE numerous and well-founded complaints laid before the King in Council &s;oon after the re&s;toration, again&s;t the Colony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, for their various oppre&s;&s;ions and murders, and al&s;o their contumacious di&s;obedience and re&s;i&s;tance to every order and regulation of Government, occa|&s;ioned the Agent of that Colony to be a&s;ked, by the Lords of the Council, in the cour&s;e of his examination before them, Whether the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets if they dur&s;t, would not throw off their allegiance and &s;ubjection to the Crown of England? To which que&s;tion he only replied, That his con&s;tituents were hone&s;t men; and that if he entertained &s;uch a thought of them he &s;hould be very uncharitable.</P>
<P>When, likewi&s;e it was proved again&s;t him, upon oath, that he &s;aid the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, rather than allow of appeals from their Courts of Ju&s;tice to England, would &s;ell their country to the Spaniards; the &s;ame Agent both denied and confe&s;&s;ed the charge; which drew the following ob&s;ervation from their Lord&s;hips, that they did not con&s;ider the &s;enti|ment and &s;peech &s;o much his own, as the &s;pirit of New-Eng|land.</P>
<P>When the Agent &s;ent his con&s;tituents intelligence of this examination, and of the opinions formed of their conduct in England, the General Court, dreading that their Charter would be vacated, immediately proclaimed Charles the Se|cond, which they had not hitherto done; they a &s;o voted an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, and re&s;olved to &s;end home two addi|tional Agents to attempt to varni&s;h over their crimes moral and political.</P>
<P>Their addre&s;s is in the &s;ame canting hypocritical &s;tile of all their other addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty was <Q>the be&s;t of Kings; one of the Gods a|mong men, who delighted to conform him&s;elf to the God of Gods; they pre&s;ented to his compa&s;&s;ionate eye a bottle full of tears wa&s;hed in their Je&s;himon; their Churches &s;at

in &s;ackcloth, until he held forth to them the &s;ceptre of life; they prayed that God might pre&s;erve his Maje&s;ty from all emi&s;&s;aries agitated by an infernal &s;pirit; his Ma|je&s;ty was enthronized in their con&s;ciences; he was their Lord and their Saviour; they were again poor Mephibo|&s;heth prejudicially mi&s;repre&s;ented, praying to be permitted &s;till to &s;ing the Lord's &s;ong in a &s;trange land; they ap|pealed for their innocence to God, to Angels, to his Ma|je&s;ty, and to all good men; and la&s;tly, they prayed, that the Lord might be with his mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty, and make his throne both greater and better, than the throne of David.</Q></P>
<P>The above vile non&s;en&s;e the General Court voted to be &s;ent home to his Maje&s;ty, deeming it a &s;ufficient exculpation of all their u&s;urpations, per&s;ecutions, and illegal acts.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year two Agents (<HI>Mr. Brad&s;treet and the Rev. Mr. Norton</HI>) were &s;ent home to Petition, the Lord the King, for a confirmation of their privileges: They were al&s;o to re|pre&s;ent them as loyal and obedient &s;ubjects; to take off all &s;candal and objections which had been, or &s;hould be made a|gain&s;t them; to do nothing prejudicial to the Patent; and to give a regular account of their proceedings. The&s;e are the whole in&s;tructions given their Agents on their departure; by which it is evident, that the Colony relied more upon the abilities of their Agents, than upon any proofs or atte&s;tations of their innocency&mdash;of the&s;e la&s;t, indeed, they had none to &s;end&mdash;their whole plea, in ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enuation of their guilt, con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;tale profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty and Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>Their Agents &s;et out with fear and trembling, uncertain what would be their fate when they arrived in England; in fact, they could hardly be prevailed upon to embark. Af|ter many delays and objections, which were all obviated by the Committee of the General Court, Par&s;on, Norton, the mo&s;t terrified of the two, played off a mo&s;t pious artifice; he feigned &s;ickne&s;s; took to his bed, and informed the Com|mittee, "that his voyage as yet &s;olely depended upon God." Upon this the Committee drew up &s;everal letters, which they addre&s;&s;ed to &s;undry noblemen, and others in England, and apologized for not &s;ending Agents according to his Maje&s;ty's de&s;ire, with declarations, that after they had made choice of two meet per&s;ons, <Q>it was the good plea&s;ure of him who ruleth all things, to fru&s;trate their de&s;igns, by vi&s;iting one of the Me&s;&s;engers with &s;ickne&s;s; but it &s;eems the &s;econd day after the Lord was wonderfully plea&s;ed to encourage and &s;trengthen the heart of the Reverend Mr. Norton,</Q>

&s;o that he was per&s;waded to embark, and the ve&s;&s;el in&s;tantly &s;ailed.</P>

<P>From this it appears, that they had broke through their Charter; but that his Maje&s;ty pardoned them on condition that they repealed their illegal and pre&s;umptuous Acts, which were derogatory to his prerogative and his authority in Parliament; that they, in future, admini&s;tered faithfully the Oath of Alleigance; that they con&s;tituted their Courts of Ju&s;tice in his name; that they cea&s;ed per&s;ecuting the mem|bers of the Church of England; that they acquie&s;ced in the regulation of the number of their Coun&s;ellors; that they e|lected men of integrity, and not the adherents of Faction; that they allowed all Freeholders to vote, and that they me|rited

<P>At the next Se&s;&s;ions of the General Court, all we find they did in compliance with his Maje&s;ty's letter, was giving di|rections, that the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice &s;hould henceforth be in his Maje&s;ty's name.

<P>On his arrival at Bo&s;ton, he immediately waited on the Governor, Mr. Leverett, acquainted him with the cau&s;e of his coming, and that he had brought a letter from his Maje&s;ty to the Magi&s;trates of the colony.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day he attended the Governor and Council, and delivered his Maje&s;ty's letter; after the peru&s;al of which, the Governor ob&s;erved to the Council, that the matters therein contained were very incon&s;iderable things, and ea&s;ily an&s;wered, and it did no way concern the go|vernment to take any notice thereof.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival, a report was artfully rai&s;ed to amu&s;e and di&s;tract the people about dome&s;tic troubles in England, that the Duke of York and many of the Nobi|lity had left the Court di&s;contented, had applied to the city for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that all was in confu&s;ion at home: This intelligence was reported with much confidence, was &s;aid to come from &s;ome very good people in London, and therefore mu&s;t be true.</P>
<P>The next vi&s;it he paid the Governor he told him, that &s;everal &s;hips were arrived at Bo&s;ton from France, Spain,

the Streights, and from other parts of Europe, and al&s;o from the Canaries, contrary to his Maje&s;ty's laws for en|couraging navigation, and regulating the trade of the plantations.</P>
<P>To this the Governor made an&s;wer, that the laws made by his Maje&s;ty in Parliament obliged them to do nothing but what con&s;i&s;ted with the good of the colony; that the legi&s;lative power re&s;ted &s;olely in them, to act and make laws by virtue of their charter; that all matters in differ|ence were to be concluded by their final determination, without any appeal to his Maje&s;ty; that his Maje&s;ty ought not to retrench their liberties, but might enlarge them if he plea&s;ed; and that his Maje&s;ty could do no le&s;s in rea|&s;on than let them enjoy their liberties and their trade.</P>
<P>About a month after his arrival at Bo&s;ton he went into New-Hamp&s;hire belonging to Mr. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;on, where the whole country complained of the oppre&s;&s;ion and u&s;urpa|tion of the Magi&s;trates of Bo&s;ton, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mini&s;ters upon them, not admitting them to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">crament deny|ing bapti&s;m to their children, and liberty of choo&s;ing their own Magi&s;trater and officers, becau&s;e they were not mem|bers, of the congregational churches; that as a farther mark of the power and &s;overeignty of Bo&s;ton over them, Magi&s;trates were &s;ent twice a year from Bo&s;ton to keep courts for trying of cau&s;es; that the&s;e Magi&s;trates laid what impo&s;itions, fines and taxes they thought proper, upon their e&s;tates per&s;ons and trade, contrary to the laws of England; that they earne&s;tly expected to be delivered from the oppre&s;&s;ions of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, and that his Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give them re|lief, according to the promi&s;es made them by his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ioners in 1665, who declared them not to be under the government of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>That the principal inhabitants of the province of Mayne, belonging to Mr. Gorges, but now called York|&s;hire, &s;ince &s;eized by the Bo&s;toners, made the &s;ame com|plaints to him as tho&s;e of New Hamp&s;hire; that they had intreated him to repre&s;ent their condition to his Maje&s;ty, &s;everal of them having been &s;uffered to be rui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by the Indians for having formerly expre&s;&s;ed their duty to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>That he al&s;o vi&s;ited the colony of New-Plymouth, at the reque&s;t of Governor Win&s;low, a gentleman of great courage, conduct and loyal principles, who expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;like at the carriage of the Magi&s;trates of Bo&s;ton
<PB N="125" REF="014255_0126_0F9358A347786A20">
towards his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government; at their encroaching upon the rights, trade, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the neighbouring colonies; at their laying what rates they plea&s;ed on the commodities and products of the other co|lonies imported into their harbours; and their daily breach of his Maje&s;ty's laws concerning trade and navigation; at their trading with and encouraging all nations to trade with them, to the great prejudice and detriment of his Maje&s;ty and his kingdom; and that New-England could never be &s;ecure, flouri&s;h, nor be &s;erviceable to his Maje&s;ty, until the &s;everal colonies and plantations were reduced under his Maje&s;ty's immediate government; and that the colonies of New-Plymouth and Connecticut would readily and willingly &s;ubmit to his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure and com|mands, in the di&s;po&s;al and &s;ettlement of their civil go|vernment.</P>
<P>That, during his re&s;idence at Bo&s;ton, the principal in|habitants complained of the arbitrary government and op|pre&s;&s;ions of their Magi&s;trates, and hoped his Maje&s;ty would free them from their bondage, by e&s;tabli&s;hing his royal authority among them, and governing them according to his laws.</P>
<P>That upwards of an hundred of the principal inhabi|tants, about ten years ago, had &s;ub&s;cribed and pre&s;ented to the General Court a petition, confe&s;&s;ing his Maje&s;ty's right of juri&s;diction and &s;overeignty over them and pray|ing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Court to his Maje&s;ty's orders; for which loyal petition they received a &s;evere check, their pe|tition was voted &s;candalous, they were &s;tiled the betrayers of the liberties of that colony, and ill affected to that go|vernment; and &s;ome of them, for this petition, &s;uffered greatly in their e&s;tates, and ever &s;ince had been &s;ubject to many inconveniencies, not being admitted to any offices of the government, or to the choice of the Magi&s;trates; and that by de&s;ire of the chief per&s;ons, he had &s;ent his Maje&s;|ty a copy of this petition.</P>
<P>That before his return to England, he waited on the Governor for his di&s;patches, who entertained him with a &s;harp reproof for publi&s;hing the contents of his Maje&s;ty's letters to the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, New-Hamp&s;hire and Mayne, telling him that he de&s;igned to make a di&s;turbance and mutiny in the country, and to withdraw the people from their obedience to the Magi&s;tracy of that colony, and the authority thereof; that the Governor then gave him a letter directed to the Right Honorable Mr. Secretary Co|ventry,
<PB N="126" REF="014255_0127_0F9358A40AD88128">
&s;aying to him, that was the an&s;wer which the Council thought &s;it to give to his Maje&s;ty: So that, al|though his Maje&s;ty had named him, in his royal letters, to &s;olicit a determination of the bu&s;ine&s;s depending, yet he mu&s;t wholly refer to their own letter, they not having ac|quainted him with the contents.</P>
<P>And that at his departure both the Governor and Ma|gi&s;trates &s;everally intreated him to give a favourable report of the country, and the Magi&s;trates adding, that tho&s;e that ble&s;&s;ed them God would ble&s;s, and tho&s;e that cur&s;ed them God would cur&s;e; and that whatever reports were rai&s;ed again&s;t them by wicked and evil-minded men, yet they were a people truly fearing the Lord, and very obedient to his Maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>Few ob&s;ervations need be made on the above letter to his Maje&s;ty, it may only be ob&s;erved, that the Magi&s;trates of the Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets di&s;played the &s;ame oppo&s;ition to the laws and authority of the King in Parliament, which they had uniformly made for near half a century before; and that on this occa&s;ion they al&s;o &s;hewed their u&s;ual ab&s;urdity ef|frontery, and hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that his Maje&s;ty's commands were incon&s;iderable and ea&s;ily an&s;wered, and yet that it no way concerned the Colony to take any notice of them, was acting con&s;i&s;tently with them&s;elves; their having u&s;urped two Provinces was quiet a trivial affair to them. Though the Governor and Magi&s;trates treated his Maje&s;ty's letter with &s;uch indignity, they voted to thank his Maje&s;ty for his gracious letter, at the very time they refu&s;ed to obey its contents.</P>
<P>Fal&s;e rumours from &s;ome very good people in London they continue to circulate to this day, and the&s;e rumours always are true till experience contradicts them&punc; and then other re|ports are &s;pread, adapted to the de&s;ign of the factious.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Governor was, at lea&s;t, very open in de|nying acquie&s;cence to the Acts of Trade, and in a&s;&s;erting, that the Colony deci&s;ions were final without appeal; but we cannot think him very mode&s;t for in&s;i&s;ting, that his Maje&s;ty in rea&s;on ought to allow them the enjoyment of their unlaw|ful trade.</P>
<P>What opinion the neighbouring Colonies entertained of their conduct, is &s;ufficiently obvious from the conver&s;ation with the Governor of New Plymouth, and he &s;eems, at that very di&s;tant period, to have been in&s;pired with the &s;ame &s;alu|tary opinions which actuated Parliament during the la&s;t Se&s;|&s;ions</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="014255_0128_0F9358A4967A7888">
It is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the Governor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Council, or Ma|gi&s;trates, reprimanded Mr. Randolph &s;everely for complying with his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions, which they &s;aid, tended to rai&s;e a mutiny again&s;t their authority; but it may well be wondered at, that after &s;howing &s;o much ill humour, both with the me&s;&s;age and the me&s;&s;enger of his Maje&s;ty they &s;hould have the effrontery to intreat him to give a favourable report of them; to promi&s;e him the <HI>rewards of Heaven</HI> if he grant|ed their reque&s;t, but if he refu&s;ed, to denounce again&s;t him the <HI>Cur&s;e of GOD;</HI> and to clo&s;e the whole in their impudent, hypocritical way, by a&s;&s;uring him, after their abu&s;e and di&s;|obedience, that they were <HI>a People truly fearing the Lord, and very obedient to his Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee their own public Acts; the letters and re|mon&s;trances of their be&s;t friends; the official papers of our different admini&s;trations; the examinations and orders of the Lords of the Council; the Acts of Parliament, and the let|ters of the Sovereign him&s;elf, all contributing to form a ma&s;s of inconte&s;tible evidence, illu&s;trating the turbulent and rebel|lious di&s;po&s;ition of the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> moment of their &s;ettlement of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
