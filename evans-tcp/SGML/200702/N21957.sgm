<HEAD>THE SUFFERINGS OF MARY KINNAN, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST the tear of &s;en&s;ibility &s;o often flows at the unreal tale of woe, which glows un|der the pen of the poet and the noveli&s;t, &s;hall our hearts refu&s;e to be melted with &s;orrow at the un|affected and unvarni&s;hed tale of a female, who has &s;urmounted difficulties and dangers, which on a review appear romantic, even to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Her hi&s;tory will not, perhaps, be without its u&s;e. It will di&s;play the &s;upporting arm of a Di|vine Providence: it will point to the be&s;t and &s;ur|e&s;t &s;upport under danger and adver&s;ity: and "it will teach the repiner at little evils to be ju&s;ter to his God and to him&s;elf."</P>
<P>It would be unnece&s;&s;ary and tedious to de&s;cribe the fir&s;t part of my life, as it exhibited nothing which is not daily ob&s;erved in the common walks of mankind. Suffice it to &s;ay, that, ble&s;t with the affections of the be&s;t of hu&s;bands, and the love and e&s;teem of the mo&s;t dutiful of children, my days pa&s;&s;ed &s;weetly on, and I had &s;carcely one &s;ingle wi&s;h ungratified. Happine&s;s &s;miled on our cot|tage;&mdash;content &s;pread her influence around;&mdash;the voice of grief was not heard;&mdash;and old age crept
<PB N="4" REF="028931_0003_0FDD6FC3D5B119C0">
imperceptibly on. Alas! how &s;oon was my hor|izon ob&s;cured by the dark clouds of misfortune!&mdash; how doubly poignant were rendered &s;ucceeding mi&s;eries by the recollection of &s;uch exalted hap|pine&s;s!</P>
<P>The thirteenth day of May, 1791, will never be effaced from my mind. Although &s;ince that me|morable period, four years have almo&s;t rolled their ample round, &s;till at the recollection, my bo&s;om heaves impetuous; the cold &s;weat of fear &s;tands on my brow; and the burning tear of angui&s;h gli&s;|tens in my eye. Our hou&s;e was &s;ituated in a beau|tifully romantic and agreeable place, called Ti|ger's Valley, in Randolph County, State of Virgi|nia. Here I would mark nature progre&s;&s;ing, and the revolutions of the &s;ea&s;ons; and from the&s;e would turn to contemplate the buds of virtue and of genius, &s;prouting in the bo&s;oms of my children. Employed in &s;uch a plea&s;ing occupation, on that evening, I was &s;tartled by the bur&s;ting open of the door: I turned my affrighted eyes, and leapt with terror at the &s;ight of three armed Indians. I &s;aw the fla&s;h of the mu&s;ket!&mdash;I heard the groan of my hu&s;band! Quick as thought, I &s;eized my young|e&s;t child: fear added wings to my flight, and I ran with the &s;wiftne&s;s of the wind. Alas! &s;carce|ly had I time to congratulate my&s;elf on my good fotune, before I was again caught; de&s;peration gave me &s;trength, and I again broke loo&s;e. I &s;carcely touched the ground as I cour&s;ed over the plain, when the cry of my child, &s;upplicating me for help, arre&s;ted my ear. The yearnings of ma|ternal affection extingui&s;hed my prudence; for|getting my imbecility, I flew to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and was taken. A third time I attempted to e&s;cape, but
<PB N="5" REF="028931_0004_0FDD6FC523A394B8">
was knocked to the ground with a tomahawk; I then made &s;igns of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and was carried to the hou&s;e. Gracious God! what a &s;cene pre&s;ent|ed it&s;elf to me! My child, &s;calped and &s;laugh|tered, &s;miled even then; my hu&s;band, &s;calped and weltering in his blood, fixed on me his dying eye, which, though languid, &s;till expre&s;&s;ed an appre|hen&s;ion for my &s;afety, and &s;orrow at his inability to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; and accompanied the look with a groan that went through my heart. Spare me the pain of de&s;cribing my feelings at this &s;cene, this mournful &s;cene, which racked my agonizing heart, and precipitated me to the verge of madne&s;s.</P>
<P>In happier times, I &s;hould have thought that my heart would cea&s;e to beat, and my pul&s;e forget to throb under &s;uch an accumulated weight of mi|&s;ery. But the &s;oul often acquires vigor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> fortune, and by adver&s;ity is led to the exertion of faculties, which till then were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or at lea&s;t lay dormant. Thus it was with me; I have &s;upported <HI>in reality</HI> what, <HI>in idea,</HI> had appeared im|po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>After plundering the hou&s;e of the mo&s;t valuable articles, and pinioning my arms behind me, they departed; with them I too was forced to go. Un|der the mo&s;t favorable circum&s;tances, this jour|ney would have been painful: how much more &s;o was it now, when the arrow of calamity was ran|kling in my bo&s;om; when I was faint through lo&s;s of blood; and without refre&s;hment, without re&s;t. Nature too &s;eemed to con&s;pire again&s;t me: the rain de&s;cended in torrents; the lightnings fla&s;hed dreadfully, and almo&s;t without intermi&s;|&s;ion; whil&s;t the thunder rolled awfully on high. We re&s;ted not during the whole of that night,
<Q><PB N="6" REF="028931_0005_0FDD6FC6B1D01B10">
<L>"Wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,</L>
<L>"The lion and the belly-pinched wolf</L>
<L>"Keep their fur dry."</L></Q></P>
<P>It was on Friday night that I was taken; on Saturday night they re&s;ted, and trimmed their &s;calps. Ah! what did I not feel at the &s;ight of the&s;e memorials of &s;avage cruelty. I became in|different to my exi&s;tence; I was willing to bid a|dieu to that world, whence all the lovely relatives of life were borne before me; and, had I not been re&s;trained by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, I had ter|minated my exi&s;tence by my own hand. I ap|peared, as it were, in&s;ulated to the civilized world &mdash;nay, wor&s;e than in&s;ulated, for the poor lonely mariner, who is &s;hipwrecked on &s;ome de&s;art coa&s;t, has far greater cau&s;e to rejoice than I then had.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> next day we continued our march over the more rugged rocks and mountains, wet and &s;lip|pery with the rain which had &s;o lately fallen. Na|ture was now &s;o far exhau&s;ted, that I could not ad|vance, except in a very &s;low manner, when, in&s;tead of compa&s;&s;ionating my &s;ufferings, my wearine&s;s, and misfortunes, I was beaten &s;everely for not per|forming impo&s;&s;ibilities. About this time they frequently threatened me with death; though I recked not his approach in genuine form, yet, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my &s;oul &s;hrunk from him, when thus cloathed in vengeance, too much for man to bear.</P>
<P>In this manner we continued our journey, &s;or|row and fatigue &s;till making increa&s;ed ravages on my con&s;titution, when one of the Indians was bit|ten by a &s;nake. We were obliged to &s;tay nineteen days, before he was cured and able to proceed: du|ring this period I again recovered &s;pirits and health &s;ufficient to follow my &s;avage conductors. In this
<PB N="7" REF="028931_0006_0FDD6FCA136C0BC0">
accident I beheld and ble&s;t the good providence of God, thus eminently exerted in re&s;cuing me from that world, "from who&s;e bourn no traveller returns."</P>
<P>In a few days after this we arrived at the Ohio. Dark and rainy was the night in which we formed a raft, and cro&s;&s;ed the river: dangerous as was the pa&s;&s;age, we arrived in &s;afety at the oppo&s;ite bank; &mdash;the period of my misfortunes had not yet arriv|ed; many bitter calamities were yet to be felt.</P>
<P>After this we travelled for two days through the gloomy ridges of pine. Although their extreme wetne&s;s &s;ubjected us to many inconveniencies, not to &s;ay dangers, yet the Indians were fearful of be|ing di&s;covered, if they made a fire, and, of con&s;e|quence, remained without one. From the&s;e we pa&s;&s;ed into a fine country, where we had plenty of veni&s;on, and other game; neverthele&s;s &s;o deeply was I afflicted that I cared not for the food, which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve life, and I was compelled by their threats of death, in its mo&s;t horrid form, to eat tho&s;e victuals for which I had no reli&s;h.</P>
<P>On the 29th of June we approached the Shaw|anee towns; when we arrived within about half a mile of them they fired their guns, &s;tripped the bark from five trees, painted them&s;elves and me in a mo&s;t horrid manner, and commenced the &s;calp-whoop: never did I hear a &s;ound &s;o calcula|ted to in&s;pire terror: my blood curdled within me at the &s;ound, and fear took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all my fa|culties. This they repeated five times: they then &s;eated them&s;elves, until a va&s;t number of people, attracted by the well-known and plea&s;ing &s;ound, came from the town and &s;hook hands with them:
<PB N="8" REF="028931_0007_0FDD6FCB32EE9EB8">
each per&s;on then &s;truck me with great violence o|ver the head and face, till I could not &s;ee, and till I finally dropt down &s;en&s;ele&s;s. They then reco|vered me and a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to walk into the town having previou&s;ly explained to me, that all the a|bu&s;e which had been &s;o liberally be&s;towed upon me, was to welcome me among&s;t them.</P>
<P>During my journey, the &s;en&s;e of pre&s;ent danger, blunted the remembrance of pa&s;t mi&s;ery, and pre|vented me from indulging in gloomy anticipation of future woe;&mdash;but now the whole weight of my affliction pre&s;&s;ed heavily on my heart. The picture of my life was deeply, too deeply da&s;hed with &s;hade, and but a few faint &s;trokes of light were intermingled with the numerous touches of the <HI>&s;ombre</HI> pencil. But when my &s;pirits were &s;ur|charged with &s;orrow's dew, I breathed out a fer|vent prayer to heaven, and relied on the benefi|cence of the Father of All. Uniformly my efforts were &s;ucce&s;sful, and a calm re&s;ignation diffu&s;ed it|&s;elf through my frame, or the rays of hope danced &s;weetly round my heart.</P>
<P>I lived during four days with the &s;i&s;ter of the &s;avage who tore me from my peaceful home, and often contemplated with a &s;igh the depth of degra|dation, of which the human character is capable. On the third of July I was bought by a Delaware &s;quaw, and by her was put to the mo&s;t menial and laborious offices.</P>
<P>One of the principal objects of my attention, whil&s;t I lived among&s;t the Indians, was the humi|liating condition of their women. Here the fe|male &s;ex, in&s;tead of poli&s;hing and improving the rough manners of the men, are equally ferocious,
<PB N="9" REF="028931_0008_0FDD6FD1526EC3E8">
cruel, and obdurate. In&s;tead of that benevolent di&s;po&s;ition and warm &s;en&s;ibility to the &s;ufferings of others, which marks their characters in more civilized climes, they quaff with extatic plea&s;ure the blood of the innocent pri&s;oner, writhing with agony under the inhuman torments inflicted upon him&mdash;whil&s;t his convul&s;ive groans &s;peak mu&s;ic to their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>With my new mi&s;tre&s;s I continued until the de|feat of St. Clair; then another &s;cene was pre&s;ent|ed to me, which opened afre&s;h the &s;luices of &s;or|row. The numerous &s;calps of my unfortunate countrymen, which were then exhibited to my view&mdash;the rejoicings which took place on that la|mentable occa&s;ion&mdash;and the brutal &s;cenes which were then tran&s;acted, &s;orely wounded my bo&s;om, already pierced &s;o deeply by misfortune's &s;haft.&mdash; Still my &s;ufferings were not alleviated; fed in a very &s;canty manner, I was forced, neverthele&s;s, to chop and carry wood to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance: in this occupation I had my feet frozen, and this added one more to my already long li&s;t of woes.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring, for fear of my countrymen, the Indians removed from the Miami towns to Grand Glaize, a mo&s;t beautiful place. Here my &s;uffer|ings became &s;till more aggravated, although they had before appeared at their highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible height. A new piece of ground was now to be cleared, and my heart grew more heavy in propor|tion as I was &s;eparated from my beloved country.</P>
<P>About this time there were pro&s;pects of peace. Hope, at all times ea&s;ily enkindled, blazed forth at this pro&s;pect, and gilded my &s;olitary foot&s;teps: but the year pa&s;&s;ed away, and the deva&s;tations of
<PB N="10" REF="028931_0009_0FDD5EA3C1EA5F28">
war &s;till continued. At this time an Indian tra|der engaged to convey a letter from me to my friends in New-Jer&s;ey, which he did by my direc|tion, and this was the fir&s;t news they had heard of me &s;ince my captivity, and, in the end, was the means of procuring my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding year commi&s;&s;ioners came from the United States to conclude a treaty; they de|parted, however, without attaining their object. The Indians, finding peace was not to be expect|ed, turned out very generally for war, and left me, a prey to all the gloomy horrors of de&s;pair. In a &s;hort time they returned, bringing with them &s;ome hor&s;es and two pri&s;oners; one of whom, Pe|ter Tuttle, was afterwards redeemed&mdash;the other was killed by one of their chiefs.</P>
<P>In November the Indians began to be weary of war, and, in the beginning of January, &s;ent in a talk to General Wayne by a Robert Wil&s;on, an Indian trader, together with three Indians. Gen|eral Wayne in&s;i&s;ted, as a preliminary article, that all the pri&s;oners &s;hould be delivered up: accord|ingly they came home, and collected a great num|ber of us, unfortunate &s;ufferers, and prepared to &s;et out the next day to General Wayne at Fort Jeffer&s;on. But previously to our departure, one of the Briti&s;h agents came to them, and per&s;uaded them, that perfidy was a leading trait in the cha|racter of the people of the United States; that they had placed ambu&s;cades for them; and that they would never return alive. By the&s;e and o|ther arts, they per&s;uaded the Indians to per&s;evere in their warfare, and we were again di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to our laborious occupations.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="028931_0010_0FDD6FD16EC52118">O Britain! how heavy will be the weight of thy crimes at the la&s;t great day! In&s;tigated by thee, the Indian murderer plunges his knife into the bo|&s;om of innocence, of piety, and of virtue; and drags thou&s;ands into a captivity, wor&s;e than death. The cries of widows, and the groans of orphans daily a&s;cend, like a thick cloud, before the judg|ment-&s;eat of heaven, and
<Q><L>"Plead like angels, trumpet-tongued,</L>
<L>"For your damnation:</L>
<L>"And pity, like a naked, new-born babe,</L>
<L>"Striding the bla&s;t, or heav'n's cherubin, hors'd</L>
<L>"Upon the &s;ightle&s;s couriers of the air,</L>
<L>"Shall blow your horrid deeds in every eye,</L>
<L>"That tears &s;hall drown the wind."</L></Q></P>
<P>I had by this time witne&s;&s;ed &s;o many di&s;ap|pointments, that I yielded my&s;elf up entirely to de&s;pondency, and endeavored to &s;tifle the few &s;cattered rays of hope, which faintly twinkled, like the glimmerings of a lamp ju&s;t ready to expire.&mdash; In con&s;equence of the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, I fell danger|ou&s;ly ill of a fever, which was accompanied by an exce&s;&s;ive pain over my whole frame. The Indians now abated, in &s;ome degree, of the rough treat|ment which I had before experienced: but what contributed principally to my recovery was a let|ter, which I received from my brother, Jacob Lewis, mentioning that he was at Detroit, but that he dared not at pre&s;ent come to a&s;&s;i&s;t me becau&s;e of the antipathy which the Indians evidenced a|gain&s;t him, on account of his being a native of the United States. To know that I was not immur|ed beyond the knowledge of my friends and rela|latives; that they &s;till entertained for me a warm, impa&s;&s;ioned affection, was a delicious cordial to
<PB N="12" REF="028931_0011_0FDD6FD2A159E338">
my drooping &s;pirits. In return to this letter I wrote, that as it would be in the highe&s;t degree dangerous to come to the place where I then was, I advi&s;ed him &s;till to continue at Detroit, and if it were po&s;&s;ible by any means to ameliorate my con|dition, I made no doubt he would exert him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t of his power. For &s;ix months, we en|joyed the plea&s;ure of each other's corre&s;pondence, being but one hundred and forty miles di&s;tant, and enjoying a con&s;tant communication by means of the Indian traders. In the darke&s;t and mo&s;t gloomy &s;ea&s;ons, his letters in&s;pired me with com|fort; and whil&s;t I traced in them with joy the &s;entiment of friend&s;hip, and the warmth of fra|ternal affection, I would for a time forget my griefs in the extacy of delight.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, 1793, we heard of the approach of General Wayne's army. Fearful and perturbed, they immediately &s;tarted for the Rapids of the Miami; taking only tho&s;e things with which they could not di&s;pen&s;e, and hiding or burying the re&s;t. On the tenth I had re&s;olved to make my e&s;cape; my plan was thoroughly matu|red, and I waited with impatience the approach of night to put it in execution. But how frail and uncertain are the &s;chemes of mankind! how ea&s;ily are even their be&s;t projects overturned! Going out on that day to get a tent-pole, I accidentally cut my foot in a mo&s;t dangerous manner; this being at the di&s;tance of eighteen miles from the Rapids and being unable to walk, I was obliged to be car|ried thither on a hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Soon after I arrived I heard from my brother who had joined a party of Briti&s;h traders, and was coming down to the Rapids that he might &s;ee
<PB N="13" REF="028931_0012_0FDD6FD735A7AFF0">
and perhaps a&s;&s;i&s;t me to e&s;cape. He &s;ent a French|man to me, who behaving in a manner which di&s;|plea&s;ed the Indians, I reque&s;ted him not to come again. He returned, and in a &s;hort time my bro|ther came him&s;elf. As he was pa&s;&s;ing through the Indian camp I accidentally &s;aw him: my joy was &s;o great that I involuntarily gave a &s;cream of plea&s;ure:&mdash;the Indian who was with me, &s;urpriz|ed at this &s;ingular behaviour, viewed me with an inqui&s;itive eye; I fully comprehended the mean|ing of his look, and excu&s;ed my&s;elf in a manner which, I believe, di&s;&s;ipated his apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>In order to concert &s;ome means of e&s;cape, my brother &s;ent a friend to exchange bread for milk. After performing this errand he opened to me his real bu&s;ine&s;s, and appointed a tree where I might meet my brother that night. According to the&s;e directions I went, and how great was my &s;urprize and di&s;appointment to find nobody there. But the per&s;on who had previou&s;ly appointed the tree as a place to meet, explained to me the next day the rea&s;on why we mi&s;&s;ed of each other, we hav|ing gone to different trees. The next night, how|ever, the Indians having fallen a&s;leep, I &s;tole out about eleven o'clock. I found the brother of my heart anxiou&s;ly expecting my arrival: after tho&s;e congratulations which might be expected from two &s;o dear to each other, who had been &s;o long &s;eperated, we &s;tarted and ran two miles to the Bri|ti&s;h camp. I then, with a beating, fearful heart, crept into a bru&s;h-heap, where I lay during all that night, and on the next day my brother came and carried me from the place where I was lodg|ed, on board a ve&s;&s;el, which was about to de&s;cend
<PB N="14" REF="028931_0013_0FDD6FD73B912D10">
the Miami river, the captain of which he had in|tere&s;ted in my behalf&mdash;having previou&s;ly dre&s;t me in one of his own &s;uits of clothes and tied an handkerchief over my eyes, in order, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to conceal my features. When we came to the mouth of the river, we anchored in full view of the Indians, who had come to the Lake, as well to avoid General Wayne, as to receive their provi&s;ion, which was given them at this place. In this &s;ituation I remained &s;ome time, fearful of being recognized and re-claimed by &s;ome of the Indians: but finally, I prevailed with the ma&s;ter of a batteau, who was going to Turtle I&s;land in Lake Erie, to carry me thither with him. When we arrived there we went on board a &s;hip which was then lying at anchor there, bearing twelve guns, and were &s;trictly examined by a Commodore Grant, who, when informed of my &s;ufferings, u&s;ed his intere&s;t to have me taken on board a brig going to Detroit. Having arrived at this la&s;t-mentioned place, I was &s;o overcome by the joy which I felt at my delivery and the fa|tigue which attended it, that I continued unwell and unable to proceed for eight days. At the ex|piration of this period, I cro&s;&s;ed Lake Erie and came to Niagara, where I was again examined, and having produced the pa&s;s given us by Commodore Grant, obtained another from Simcoe to the Uni|ted States. We de&s;cended in a batteau to the Gen|e&s;ee river, and thence travelled to New-Jer&s;ey, where I arrived among&s;t my friends on the ele|venth day of October, 1794.</P>
<P>If my hi&s;tory has been marked with woe-worn incidents;&mdash;if I have been in a peculiar manner the child of misfortune;&mdash;if my cup of life has
<PB N="15" REF="028931_0014_0FDD6FD8AFB0B5B0">
been deeply mixed with gall;&mdash;if de&s;pair has brooded over my &s;oul, with all its horrors;&mdash;and finally, if I have been obliged to di&s;mi&s;s even dear delu&s;ive hope, having &s;o often felt "what kind of &s;ickne&s;s of the heart that was, which proceeds from hope deferred:"&mdash;yet, by the&s;e very woes, I have been led to place my dependence on the be|neficent di&s;pen&s;er of good and evil, and to with|draw my affections from that world, where the ties by which mankind are in general &s;o firmly bound are indi&s;&s;olubly broken. Since the con&s;equences of my affliction have been &s;o beneficial, I repine not at it; ye, who are pierced by the darts of mi&s;|fortune, imitate my example, and like me recline on the bo&s;om of your Father and your God.</P>
