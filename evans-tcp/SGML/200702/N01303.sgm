<P>I am now to Enquire;
<HI>Who are the Ungodly Ones, by whom the Grace of God is turned into Wantonne&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>In brief; All they that are not by the <HI>Favour</HI> of God, brought the more to Love &s;o Gracious a God, by whom they are &s;o <HI>favourably</HI> dealt with|al.

<HEAD>A Few Thoughts on that QUESTION; Whether the Penitent Thief on the Cro&s;s, be not an Example of One Repenting at the La&s;t Hour, and on &s;uch a Late Repentance received unto Mercy?</HEAD>
<P>I Am far from a <HI>Perempto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y Denial</HI> of it. I cannot prove, that we <HI>have not</HI> &s;uch an Example here given unto us.

Re&s;entment unto the Friends of Piety, that the <HI>Thief on the Cro&s;s,</HI> going a Villian thither, and <HI>at the La&s;t Hour</HI> finding <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Forgive|ne&s;s</HI> there, has been the <HI>Goliahs Sword,</HI> and a &s;ort of <HI>Enchanted Spear,</HI> by which the cau&s;e of <HI>Per&s;i&s;ting Impenitency,</HI> has been maintained in the World.

<P>Unto me, it &s;eems not at all <HI>Improbable,</HI> nay, there appears an high <HI>Probability</HI> for it; That the Malefactor now Repenting on the Cro&s;s, <HI>brought thither</HI> the <HI>Saving Di&s;po&s;itions of Repen|tance</HI> with him, and had before now <HI>begun</HI> upon him a Work of that <HI>Repentance, which is unto Salvation.</HI> For,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, there is nothing in the Sacred Hi&s;tory, to brand this Poor Man with the Character of an <HI>Unrepenting Sinner,</HI> at the Time of his being brought forth to his Execution.

They are ignorant of the <HI>Hebrew Style.</HI> [See Judg.

<P>Yet more;</P>
<P>It was not only a <HI>True Faith,</HI> which the Pe|nitent here Exerci&s;es; but he looks like one grown <HI>Strong in Faith,</HI> in <HI>giving &s;uch Glory to God.</HI> My <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;ayes truly upon it. <HI>Cert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> vix a Mundo condito magis rar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m et memorabile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idei Exemplum unquam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">xtitit.</HI> Perceiving our JESUS to be that <HI>Son of God,</HI> on whom he had Believed, he now makes a mo&s;t Marvellous <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of His <HI>Glory.</HI>

He a&s;cribes to <HI>Him</HI> the <HI>Glory,</HI> which belongs unto the Promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and that <HI>Seed</HI> that was to <HI>brui&s;e the Head of the Angel of Death.</HI> And, as it was of old remarked, <HI>A Latrone victi &s;unt Apo&s;toli, qui tun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> credidit, quando illi defecerunt;</HI> He was the only <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> our Saviour now had cleaving unto him; I had almo&s;t &s;aid, <HI>The only Vi&s;ible Believer,</HI> in the World, at lea&s;t, the <HI>only Thorough paced</HI> One. He &s;upplied the Room of <HI>Judas,</HI> (who was a <HI>Thief;</HI>) He Preached Him on the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> whom <HI>Judas</HI> betray'd to the <HI>Cro&s;s.</HI> Yea, he was, as one calls him, <HI>The A|po&s;tle of the Apostles.</HI> He declared his <HI>Faith,</HI> when it could afford no <HI>Temporal Advantage</HI> at all unto him; He did it, when it would rather augment the <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Scorn,</HI> which was now heaping upon him; He did it, when as <HI>Austin</HI> &s;ayes, <HI>His Confe&s;&s;ing of a Crucified Christ, was in a Man|ner,</HI> (quantum &s;i fui&s;&s;et pro Domino Cruci|fixus,) <HI>as much as if he had been him&s;elf Cruci|fied for Him, whom he Confe&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; The <HI>Labour</HI> he u&s;es to convince his Companion of his Impiety, and Reclame him from it, and Quicken the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in him; it looks as if he <HI>came thither armed</HI> with a Zea|lous and Inten&s;e De&s;ire to Propagate a Sen&s;e of God in the Hearts of others. A Repentance has u&s;ually made a little <HI>Progre&s;s,</HI> before it Comes into this Operation. One does not <HI>Per Saltum,</HI> come to this <HI>Degree.</HI> Methinks, All the&s;e Things con&s;pire, to Proclaim a <HI>Saving work of Repentance begun</HI> in this Penitent, before his <HI>La&s;t Hour</HI> came upon him. However, <HI>This</HI> I am &s;ure they do; and <HI>this</HI> is what I mainly aim at: they utterly

de&s;troy all the <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> which any Pre&s;uming Sinner has, that this Man did <HI>not Repent</HI> until his <HI>Last Hour</HI> was arrived unto him.

<P>I do not affirm that my Arguments, for the more <HI>Early Repentance</HI> of my Penitent, are ab|&s;olutely <HI>Deci&s;ive,</HI> and infallibly <HI>Conclu&s;ive;</HI> but yet, I think them enough to retund the <HI>Confi|dent Prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> of them, who encourage the <HI>Delay</HI> of their Conver&s;ion to God, from the <HI>Pattern</HI> of the <HI>Thief,</HI> Repenting and Accepted on the Cro&s;s. And it may be further ob&s;erved unto them, that the Holy and Worthy Divines, who take up with the common Opinion, and Glo|rify God, in the Highe&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Mi|racle</HI> in the Sudden <HI>Producing</HI> and <HI>Ripening</HI> of this Repentance, do &s;till with mighty Energy Thunder&s;trike, that Profane <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of the Exam|ple. They tell you, Ye <HI>Fools,</HI> That if it be a <HI>Pattern,</HI> yet it is a <HI>Pattern</HI> without a <HI>Promi&s;e.</HI> And as One of the Ancients Expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>Ad Con&s;equendam Fidem non fuit illi Extrema Hora, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d Prima;</HI> they tell you, That it might more properly be &s;aid, He came in at the <HI>Fir&s;t Hour,</HI> than at the <HI>La&s;t Hour;</HI> for he had not Enjoy'd the <HI>Means of Grace</HI> before, nor Sinn'd again&s;t them, as <HI>they</HI> do, who embolden them&s;elves to Sin, from what was done for <HI>him.</HI> They tell you, The mo&s;t you can make, if the Example be granted you, is, <HI>One Example</HI> in all the Bible.

In fine; I &s;hould be as much offended, as the Martyr <HI>Bilney,</HI> to hear any one di&s;couraging an <HI>Old Penitent,</HI> from Hopes of Pardoning Mercy.
