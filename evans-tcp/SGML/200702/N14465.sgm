<HEAD>THE LIFE and DYING CONFESSION of <HI>RICHARD BARRICK,</HI> HIGH-WAY ROBBER.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>RICHARD BARRICK,</HI> was born in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the month of February, in the year 1763, and brought up in the Found|ling-Ho&s;pital: I never could read nor write. At ten years of
<PB N="7" REF="018324_0005_0FA5CDFDB860BD40">
age I went as apprentice to <HI>James Saun|ders,</HI> a Silk-weaver in <HI>Spittlefield</HI> Pari&s;h, lived with my ma&s;ter about three years, but he &s;tarved and froze me almo&s;t to death, for which I left him, and roved through the &s;treets, and frequently &s;tole &s;mall things from &s;hop-windows.</P>
<P>I WENT to <HI>Salt-petre Bank</HI> and joined a gang of thieves. We &s;tole from many people for the &s;pace of a year; when I was taken up for &s;tealing a handkerchief, and carried before the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who &s;ent me to goal. I was tried and found not <HI>innocent;</HI> was complimented with thirteen &s;tripes, <HI>which is Continental colours,</HI> &s;ignifying, that I &s;hould be ho|noured in <HI>America</HI> with the <HI>Hibernian</HI> coat of arms, i. e. two &s;ticks <HI>rampant,</HI> one couchant, a &s;tring <HI>pendant,</HI> and an <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> at the end of it.</P>
<P>I JOINED my old gang again, and con|tinued picking pockets for one year, and then was taken up and commit|ted to goal, and lay there eleven weeks for trial; then tried and found guil|ty.
<PB N="8" REF="018324_0006_0FA5CDFE5DF39270">
They told me they would pardon me if I would enter on board one of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips; this I con&s;ented to, but made my e&s;cape before I got to the &s;hip. I returned back to <HI>Salt-petre Bank,</HI> where I joined my old companions in iniquity; went on picking pockets for &s;ix months, and was apprehended on &s;u&s;picion of robbery, and was &s;ent on board a ve&s;&s;el in which I came to <HI>New-York</HI></P>
<P>THEN I de&s;erted and went to <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and lived with Mr. <HI>Volentine Wil|liams;</HI> I left him and lived with Mr. <HI>Kirk,</HI> fifteen months, intending to learn Paper-Making. <HI>During this time I was as hone&s;t as the times would allow.</HI> I left Mr. <HI>Kirk,</HI> and went to <HI>Hor&s;e-Neck,</HI> intending to return to the place from whence I came, and follow my old trade of <HI>Ba&s;ket-Making.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after this, I and my comrades went to <HI>Long I&s;land,</HI> with an intent to rob <HI>James Ulits;</HI> but the weather being very &s;evere, we turned back. On our return, we met with a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> ve&s;&s;el which we boarded, and carried her into <HI>Stanford.</HI> We then went
<PB N="9" REF="018324_0007_0FA5CDFF4C2705E0">
back to Mr. <HI>Ulit's</HI> in the night, and told him he mu&s;t get up, for his brother's child was very &s;ick&mdash;He &s;uppo&s;ing us to be robbers, call'd for his firelock: We then forced in at the windows, and demanded his money. He &s;aid he had none; but his wife a&s;ked us how much we wanted? I an&s;wered one hundred pounds, Mr. <HI>Ulit</HI> went down cellar with a light in his hand, and we followed him; he took a horn from under a hog&s;head, which contained one hundred and ninety odd guineas. He then attempted to count out our hundred pound which we demanded; but we told him that as he made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance at fir&s;t, we would take all he had. He then gave us another horn, which con|tained about forty guineas: Then he gave us a number of dollars. We went out of the hou&s;e, but &s;oon concluded that if he had &s;o many guineas, it was more than probable he had &s;ome other &s;ort of gold; therefore we went back and demanded the remainder. Then he gave us another horn, containing thir|ty two half joes. We al&s;o took his plate and cloathing, to the value of one hun|dred
<PB N="10" REF="018324_0008_0FA5CE0348E6C730">
dollars. We ordered him to give us &s;ome liqour; he obeyed us. Then we went back to our boat unmole&s;ted, and gave the man who took care of the boat two guineas.</P>
<P>AFTER this we went to <HI>Copt-I&s;land,</HI> where we divided our booty.</P>
<P>FROM thence we went to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and tarried there until our money grew &s;hort: Then we went over to <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> to the hou&s;e of one <HI>Allber&s;on</HI> where we knocked at the door and de|manded a light: We then demanded his money: He gave us money and plate to the amount of two hundred dol|lars: We eat and drank in his hou&s;e, and then ordered him to keep the matter &s;e|cret for three weeks, which I have rea&s;on to think he was fool enough comply with. After dividing the boo|ty, I returned to <HI>Stanford,</HI> and tar|ried there until my money grew &s;hort.</P>
<P>I AND my comrades went to <HI>Long-
<PB N="11" REF="018324_0009_0FA5CE03D9C26410">
I&s;land,</HI> and order'd one <HI>Peter Sniffing</HI> to open his door, which he did; we then made a civil demand upon him, which was, <HI>Give us all your money;</HI> he &s;aid he had none. (Take notice that as <HI>Sniffing</HI> knew me, I did not enter the hou&s;e:) After his refu&s;al one of our gang came out to me for advice: I told him to fla&s;h a pi&s;|tol in <HI>Sniffing's</HI> face, and then he would comply; but this had not the de&s;ir|ed effect; for <HI>Sniffing</HI> had two pi&s;tols and other weapons: However, we di&s;|armed and robbed him of money and cloathing.</P>
<P>WE went from there to <HI>Cow-Neck,</HI> and attacked the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>John Mitchel;</HI> his wife &s;aw us coming, upon which &s;he blew out the candles and bar'd the doors: We ordered him to open the door, which he refu&s;ed; then we bur&s;t the door open with a &s;tone. One of <HI>Mitchel's</HI> family fired at us and wounded one of our gang. <HI>Mitchel</HI> fell upon the wounded man who cried for mercy. We retired a little way and held con&s;ultation: Our leader &s;aid that one man was wounded
<PB N="12" REF="018324_0010_0FA5CE048D7E6820">
and &s;hould not be left behind; then we made the &s;econd attack upon the hou&s;e, but was obliged to retreat again; then we made the third attack, upon which they left the room: We then brought off the wounded man, who (like a true chri&s;tian) begged us to retaliate upon <HI>Mitchel,</HI> as he was unable to do it him&s;elf. All we took from the hou&s;e was the fire|arms: Then we went to our boat; one of our party &s;aid he wanted &s;ome retaliation; that one returned back and met <HI>Mitchel's</HI> &s;on at the door, whom he in&s;tantly &s;hot dead. After he had &s;hot the young man he &s;aid he had got &s;atisfaction in behalf of his wounded partner. We made the be&s;t of our way to the boat and went to <HI>New-Rochel,</HI> where we was hailed by the guard: We told them we had a man wounded by the Refugees. We ran away from the guard, leaving our boat and all behind except our fire-arms.</P>
<P>WE went to <HI>Greenwich</HI> and gave relief to our wounded partner; there I parted with my comrades. From thence I went to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> intending to get
<PB N="13" REF="018324_0011_0FA5CE082C91FD08">
&s;ome employment. I got no work there, and went to <HI>Norwich</HI>&mdash;No employment there, I returned to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where I met with the wounded man, in compa|ny with a well man. The well man went with me to <HI>Long-I&s;land.</HI> We intended to rob the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Titus;</HI> but a guard being kept at his hou&s;e, we hid in a &s;wamp, and went from thence to <HI>Sand's-Point.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this I and others broke open the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>James Mots,</HI> and took from him fifty guineas, be&s;ides plate and cloathing, to the amount of two hundred pounds. We went to <HI>Greenwich</HI> and divided the booty: Then we parted and met again in a fortnight. Then we went to the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>John Sands</HI> on <HI>Long-I&s;land.</HI> Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> let us in, I demanded his money: He denied having any. I made &s;earch and &s;ound fourteen dollars, one &s;ilver &s;poon, twenty-three guineas and one half joe, together with cloathing and plate, to the amount of ten pounds. Then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> made off, but was pur&s;ued &s;o clo&s;e that one of our party was taken. We
<PB N="14" REF="018324_0012_0FA5CE08592FA5A8">
re&s;cued him; but the pur&s;uers pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard upon us, that they took two more of our party, and brought them to trial; but they availed them&s;elves of a &s;tratagem, and told a fal&s;e &s;tory; for they told the pur&s;uers that they were not in our gang; but were endeavouring to take us pri&s;oners. I e&s;caped my&s;elf and kept concealed &s;ome time. I hid in a hollow rock. After this I went to <HI>Hog-I&s;land,</HI> in company with other &s;inners: We rob|ed one Mr. <HI>Ledlow</HI> of &s;ix dollars and a watch, and a quantity of cloathing. We returned to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> from thence to <HI>Heton's-Neck;</HI> There we broke open a hou&s;e and robbed the ma&s;ter of one hun|dred and &s;ixty dollars, and cloathing to the amount of thirty dollars.</P>
<P>AFTER that we went to <HI>Green|wich;</HI> and from thence to <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and broke open Mr. <HI>Allber&s;on's</HI> hou&s;e, and robbed him of twenty-four dollars. (It may not be ami&s;s to notice here, that I had robbed this man once before.) The next night we went into the hou&s;e of one Mr. Par&s;ons, and demanded his
<PB N="15" REF="018324_0013_0FA5CE098F6884E0">
money; but there being fifteen or &s;ix|teen folks in the hou&s;e, we could not collect them all together. The man of the hou&s;e went on the roof and &s;ound|ed an alarm. We went into the cham|ber and found an iron che&s;t, but could not break it open, nor get it cut of the room: The neighbours rai&s;ed a party who fired upon us; but we made our e&s;cape.</P>
<P>AFTER this we went to <HI>Long-I&s;land</HI> and were di&s;covered; therefore we hid our|&s;elves &s;everal days. Then we went with an intent to rob one <HI>Henry Po&s;t,</HI> but were di&s;covered, and ran into the woods. We went to a hou&s;e that right and demanded a &s;upper; they gave us one.</P>
<P>SOON after this we &s;et out for <HI>New-York,</HI> but were taken and carried before a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonel and examined; they a&s;ked my name, and told me they wan|ted to catch <HI>Barrick:</HI> (They did not know I was the man.) I told them my name was <HI>Richard Willis.</HI> The Colonel ordered a party to e&s;cort me out of the lines; but unluckily for me we met with
<PB N="16" REF="018324_0014_0FA5CE09B4F39E48">
a party of about twenty. They a&s;ked our party if they had got <HI>Barrick?</HI> The an&s;wer was, They, had not: but one of their party knew me and called me by my right name, and &s;ays, <HI>Now we have you we will keep you.</HI> Then they bound me and kept me in that &s;ituati|on almo&s;t five weeks.</P>
<P>THE people I had robbed came to &s;ee me, to know whether, they could &s;wear to me out of the whole gang. There were but two of the &s;pectators could &s;wear to me, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Allber&s;on</HI> and <HI>Robbins.</HI></P>

<P>I <HI>JOHN SULLIVAN,</HI> was born in <HI>Ireland</HI> in the town of <HI>Limrick,</HI> and was eighteen years old la&s;t A|pril. I &s;hall minute down my crimes in the order I committed them.</P>
<P>CRIME I. I inli&s;ted as a &s;oldier in the

<P>CRIME 2.

<P>CRIME 3. I enter'd on board a &s;loop bound to <HI>New-York,</HI> but hawl'sd in at <HI>Lovd's-Neck:</HI> When I landed I was di&s;cover'd and pur&s;ued by the Doctor of my former ve&s;&s;el; he was on hor&s;e|back, and drove me into the water, but was obliged to come on &s;hore and &s;urrender; I then received thirty-nine la&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="018324_0019_0FA5CE0E24E7EFE0">
CRIME 4. The &s;ame night I de&s;erted and &s;wam to another ve&s;&s;el commanded by one <HI>Kelley:</HI> The ma&s;ter and I combined together, and &s;tole the ve&s;&s;el, carried her into <HI>Stonington</HI> and &s;old her: I receiv|ed about three hundred dollars for my &s;hare.</P>

<P>CRIME 7. I went about &s;even miles to a place called <HI>Cole-Lane,</HI> and engaged to go on board a privateer, took twenty-four dollars from the Captain and then bid them good night. I next went to St. <HI>Georges;</HI> there I enter'd on board ano|ther privateer, Capt. <HI>Hall</HI> commander, and took twenty-four dollars bounty: We went five weeks crui&s;e and returned to <HI>Bermudas.</HI> Being de&s;titute of all things, I endeavoured to help my&s;elf to that which <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays <HI>will an&s;wer all things;</HI> and knowing that one <HI>Gutheridge</HI> kept a &s;tore there, I took a partner with me and broke open his &s;tore, where we found a barrel of dollars; we took our pockets and hats full, then went to a place called <HI>Salt-Kittles</HI> and changed the &s;ilver for gold.</P>

<HI>St. Thomas's:</HI> Peace being proclaimed I went to <HI>North Carolina.</HI> I went from thence to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> where I went to work three weeks: Then I and my part|ner broke open a &s;tore in the day-time and took out twenty-four half-joes an &s;ome &s;ilver; my comrade was taken up on &s;u&s;picion and carried before a Ju&s;|tice, but made his e&s;cape; and as was not &s;u&s;pected, was &s;ent to catch him.

<P>CRIME 9. Soon after this I got a new comrade, and we broke open a &s;hop and took out the value of a hundred pounds in money and watches. I then went to <HI>Newbury-Port,</HI> where I entered on board Capt. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> bound for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI> When I arrived there I went into a trader's &s;hop and took to the value of forty pounds, in goods. Soon after this I took another comrade and walking out we met a man in the road: We told him we wanted &s;ome money, and &s;ome we would have; the man gave us three crowns.

<P>CRIME 10. On Friday night before Commencement, <HI>Barrick</HI> and I went to <HI>Roxbury</HI> with an intent to rob any per&s;on, but we were di&s;appointed. The next Monday night we went upon the old er|rand but no booty. Soon after this we

<HEAD>Thy BROTHER'S BLOOD crieth unto ME from the Ground. THE CONFESSION OF ALEXANDER WHITE, PIRATE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is to give &s;atisfaction to all enquiring Friends, that I <HI>ALEXANDER WHITE,</HI> was born in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the County of <HI>Tyrone,</HI> in the year of our Lord one thou&s;and &s;e|ven hundred and &s;ixty-two, and was brought up in &s;aid place, and got what education my Parents thought nece&s;&s;ary. After I grew up, my mind being inclined to &s;ee &s;trange countries again&s;t my Pa|rent's

will. I took my departure from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and went to <HI>England</HI> and bound my&s;elf apprentice to learn the Mariner's art, and &s;erved my Ma&s;ter faithfully un|til it plea&s;ed him to give up my inden|tures.</P>
<P>I STILL followed the occupation of a Mariner, and improved my education 'till I thought my&s;elf fit to take the command of a ve&s;&s;el. I have been through many &s;cenes of life, and always endeavoured to &s;upport the character of an hone&s;t man, and I believe I was harmle&s;s to any body but my&s;elf. It is needle&s;s for me to give an account how I &s;pent my life; for I have been in many parts of the world, but never did any thing that would cau&s;e me to blu&s;h or be a&s;hamed before I tran&s;act|ed this heinous crime that I am to &s;uf|fer for.</P>
<P>If you are de&s;irous to know what this temptation did ari&s;e from; with &s;hame I will endeavour to inform you: At fir&s;t when I met with Capt. <HI>White</HI> it was in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> My money being

almo&s;t &s;pent I agreed to go to <HI>Nova-Sco|tia</HI> with him. Accordingly we pur&s;ued our intended voyage as far as <HI>New-York,</HI> and there we took on board our cargo, and came to a place called <HI>Cow-Harbour,</HI> in <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and there tarried &s;ome days and took on board the pa&s;&s;enger <HI>John Vail,</HI> and &s;ailed quickly from thence.</P>
<P>MY mind being very unea&s;y on account of a young lady who I propo&s;ed to marry, and only the want of money prevented our being married. Being below her degree, and being a&s;hamed to own my nece&s;|&s;ity, prolonged our being joined in wed|lock. But Love began to burn my poor and wounded heart; and being re&s;olved to go through any difficulty that might im|pede us, I intended to take the life of my fellow-creature; one evening &s;eeing a good opportunity, I took up an ax, and with it &s;truck Capt. <HI>White</HI> over board, and attempted to murder the pa&s;&s;enger al&s;o; but when I found I could not ac|compli&s;h my purpo&s;e, &s;urrendered my&s;elf a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="018324_0028_0FA5CE198CAF8348">
I WAS confined for &s;ome time. Towards morning we fell in with a ve&s;&s;el, who car|ried me into <HI>Plymouth</HI> as a pri&s;oner, and remained there for a con&s;iderable time, which I &s;pent in angui&s;h, imploring mer|cy from GOD, for the crime I had commit|ted. Then I was &s;ent to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and condemned to die by my own confe&s;&s;ion: And, agreeable to my inclination, (chu|&s;ing rather to die than to live.) Time would fail me to give a particular account of this affair; but this is the truth that I have &s;et forth, which I declare as a dying cri|minal.</P>
