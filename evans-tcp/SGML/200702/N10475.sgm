<Q>That a Sum not exceeding Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds be granted to his Maje&s;ty upon Account, to enable his Maje&s;ty to give a proper Compen&s;ation to the re&s;pective Provinces in North America, for the Expences incurred by them in the Levying, Clothing and Pay of the Troops rai&s;ed by the &s;ame, according as the active Vigour and &s;trenuous Efforts of the re&s;pective Provinces &s;hall be thought by his Maje&s;ty to merit.</Q></P>
<P>Similar Re&s;olutions followed yearly every Me&s;&s;age.

<P>His Maje&s;ty's Surveyor General of the Northern Di&s;trict in America, tran&s;mitted to the Lords of the Trea&s;ury in 1764, a Charge of Corruption in his Office and Collu&s;ion with Smug|glers, &s;upported by the Oaths of credible Witne&s;&s;es, again&s;t Governor Bernard; for which the Surveyor General received the Thanks of the Trea&s;ury Board, and Governor Bernard was &s;uffered &s;till to hold that Office he had abu&s;ed, and has been admitted as the principal Accu&s;er and Witne&s;s again&s;t the People of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay.</P>
<P>On the 10th of March 1764, the Hou&s;e of Commons re|&s;olved,
<Q>That it may be proper to charge certain Stamp Duties in the colonies and Plantations:</Q>

<P>On the 5th of April 1764, an Act pa&s;&s;ed for impo&s;ing Duties in America by the Briti&s;h Parliament, for the Purpo&s;e of rai&s;|ing a Revenue.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e Proceedings, the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay came to Re&s;olutions, 'That the &s;ole Right of giving and granting the Money of the People of that Province, was ve&s;ted in them as their legal Repre&s;en|tatives; and that the Impo&s;ition of Duties and Taxes, by the Parliament of Great Britain, upon a People who are not re|pre&s;ented in the Hou&s;e of Commons, is ab&s;olutely irreconcil|able with their Rights. That no Man can ju&s;tly take the Property of another without his Con&s;ent, upon which original Principle the Right of Repre&s;entation in the &s;ame Body which exerci&s;es the Power of making Laws for levying Taxes, one of the main Pillars of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, is evidently found|ed: That the Exten&s;ion of the Powers of the Court of Ad|miralty within this Province, is a mo&s;t violent Infraction of the Right of Trial by Jury,&mdash;a Right which this Hou&s;e, upon the

<P>In February 1765, a Bill for rai&s;ing a Revenue in America by Duties on Stamps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> received the Royal A&s;&s;ent.

<P>Had the Colonies been fully heard by the Parliament, it is po&s;&s;ible their Deci&s;ions with re&s;pect to the <HI>late</HI> Acts for levying Duties and Taxes on the Colonies, might have been different.

<Q>That the only Repre&s;entatives of the People of the Colonies are Per&s;ons cho&s;en therein by them&s;elves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be, con&s;titutionally impo&s;ed upon them but by their re&s;pective Legi&s;latures. That all Supplies to the Crown being free Gifts of the People, it is unrea&s;onable and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Principles and Spirit of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, for the People of Great Britain to grant to his Maje&s;ty the Property of the Coloni&s;ts. That it is the indi&s;pen&s;able Duty of the&s;e Colonies to the be&s;t of Sovereigns, to the Mother Country, and them&s;elves, to endeavour, by a loyal and dutiful Ad|dre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, and humble Applications to both Hou&s;es of Parliament, to procure the Repeal of the Act for granting and applying certain Stamp Duties, of all Clau&s;es of any other Act of Parliament whereby the Juri&s;diction of the Admiralty is extended, and of the other <HI>late</HI> Acts for the Re&s;triction of American Commerce.</Q></P>
<P>They al&s;o drew up a Petition to the King, in which they &s;ay,
<Q>Our <HI>Subordinate</HI> Legi&s;latures are in Effect rendered u&s;e|le&s;s by the late Acts of Parliament impo&s;ing Duties and Taxes on the&s;e Colonies, and extending the Juri&s;diction of the Courts of Admiralty beyond its Antient Limit: Sta|tutes by which your Maje&s;ty's Commons in Great Britain undertake ab&s;olutely to di&s;po&s;e of the Property of their Fel|low Subjects in America without their Con&s;ent, and for the Inforcing whereof they are &s;ubjected to the Determination of a &s;ingle Judge, in a Court unre&s;trained by the wi&s;e Rules of the common Law, Birthright of Engli&s;hmen, and the Safe|guard of their Per&s;ons and Properties.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The invaluable Rights of Taxing our&s;elves, and Trial by our Peers, of which we implore your Maje&s;ty's Protection, are not, we mo&s;t humbly conceive, uncon&s;titutional, but con|firmed by the Great Charter of Engli&s;h Liberty. On the fir&s;t of the&s;e Rights, the Honourable the Hou&s;e of Commons found their Practice of originating Money Bills&mdash;a Right enjoyed by the Kingdom of Ireland; by the Clergy of Eng|land, till relinqui&s;hed by them&s;elves&mdash;a Right, in fine, which all other your Maje&s;ty's Engli&s;h Subjects, both within and without the Realm, have hitherto enjoyed.</Q></P>
<P>So far were they from any Thought or De&s;ire to draw into que&s;tion, or to deny the Sovereignty of his Maje&s;ty in his Par|liament, or to arrogate to them&s;elves the &s;ole Right of making Laws, that, in their Petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, they declare the Rever&s;e in the&s;e Words&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013282_0008_0F90494379C75608">

We e&s;teem our Depen|dence on, and Connection with Great Britain, as one of our greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings, and apprehend the former will appear to be &s;ufficiently &s;ecure, when it is con&s;idered, that the Inha|bitants in the Colonies have the mo&s;t unbounded Affection for his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, Family, and Government, as well as for the Mother Country, and that their Subordination to the Parliament, is univer&s;ally acknowledged.</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e Petitions however were not received, on Pretence of their being from a Body not legally a&s;&s;embled, and unknown to the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In January 1766, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives were obliged to complain of Governor Bernard's having, together with his Council, a&s;&s;umed a Legi&s;lative Power, in ordering an Act of Parliament, or as he &s;tiles it an Ordinance, to be regi&s;tered among the Laws of the Province; which was never done be|fore, but by Act of A&s;&s;embly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>But the mo&s;t intere&s;ting Objection, which is not avowed, and therefore cannot receive a formal An&s;wer, is, that an American Repre&s;entation will take away all Pretences for di&s;puting the Ordinances of Parliament.</Q>

This ju&s;t Complaint again&s;t the U&s;urpation of the Governor, has been invidiou&s;ly re|pre&s;ented as an Attack upon the Authority of Parliament <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Extract of Governor Bernard's Letter in the Lords Report, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>, whereas in truth it had no relation to the Authority.</P>
<P>In January 1766, Petitions were pre&s;ented from the Mer|chants of London, Bri&s;tol, and Gla&s;gow, to both Hou&s;es of Parliament, repre&s;enting the great Injury that would accrue to their Property, and to the Commerce of this Kingdom, from the Operation of the Stamp Act, and praying for its Repeal.</P>
<P>The Repeal of it took place accordingly on the 19th March following.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, upon the Repeal being known, formed and tran&s;mitted an humble Addre&s;s of Thanks to his Maje&s;ty, and Letters of the mo&s;t grateful Acknowledg|ment to their Illu&s;trious Patrons and Friends in either Hou&s;e of Parliament. Soon after this they pa&s;&s;ed a Bill for granting Compen&s;ation to the Sufferers during the Di&s;orders occa&s;ioned

by the Stamp Act; agreeably to his Maje&s;ty's Recommenda|tion, in con&s;equence of the Addre&s;s of both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure being &s;ignified to them by Mr. Secretary Conway.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly al&s;o conformed them&s;elves to the Mutiny Act, though it touched the Privilege of granting freely their own Money, for which they had &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly contended. But they complied, as well from an Abhorrence of renewing the late Di&s;pute which had given them &s;o much Pain, as from a Confidence in his Maje&s;ty's then Servants, whom they re|garded as friendly to their Liberties and Rights.</P>
<P>Their Satisfaction in, and Gratitude for the Repeal of the Stamp Act, produced a conduct &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly void of Offence, that Governor Bernard could not avoid giving his Te&s;timony of it in his Letters to the Earl of Shelburne, Secretary of State, as follows:</P>
<Q><P>The Hou&s;e from the Time of opening the Se&s;&s;ion to this Day, has &s;hewn a Di&s;po&s;ition to avoid all Di&s;pute with me; every Thing having pa&s;&s;ed with as much Good-humour as I could de&s;ire, except only their continuing to act in ad|dre&s;&s;ing the King, remon&s;trating to the Secretary of State, and employing a &s;eparate Agent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hou&s;e had employed a &s;eparate Agent &s;ome Years before, and Go|vernor Bernard had given his A&s;&s;ent to a Bill for paying his Salary. What he calls addre&s;&s;ing the King, was a Petition; and remon&s;trating, was writing a Letter.</NOTE>. It is the Importance of this Innovation, without any Willfulne&s;s of my own, which induces me to make this Remon&s;trance, at a Time when I have a fair Pro&s;pect of having, in all other Bu&s;ine&s;s, nothing but good to &s;ay of the Proceedings of this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>They have acted in all Things, even in their Remon|&s;trance, with Temper and Moderation; they have avoided &s;ome Subjects of Di&s;pute, and have laid a Foundation for removing &s;ome Cau&s;es of former Altercation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make &s;uch a prudent and proper U&s;e of this Letter, as I hope will perfectly re&s;tore the Peace and Tranquillity of this Province, for which Purpose con&s;iderable Steps have already been made by the House of Repre&s;entatives.</P></Q>

We &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee what Steps were artfully taken to move them from that Moderation, and compel the Mob into Riots and Tumults, which were to be vi&s;ited upon the Town, and made the Pretext for introducing a Military Force.</P>

<P>In their Letters to the Mini&s;try, they &s;ay, 'The Subjects in this Province, and undoubtedly in all the Colonies, how|ever they may have been otherwi&s;e repre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, are loyal; they are firmly attached to the Mother State; they always con&s;ider her Intere&s;t and their own as in|&s;eparably interwoven, and it is their fervent Wi&s;h that it may ever &s;o remain. All they de&s;ire is, to be re&s;tored to the Standing upon which they were originally put, to have the Honour and Privilege of voluntarily contributing to the Aid of their Sovereign when required. They are free Subjects; and it is hoped the Nation will never con&s;ider them as in a Tributary State.' And again,
<Q>All they de&s;ire is to be placed on their Original Standing, that they may &s;till be happy in the Enjoyment of their invaluable Privileges, and the Nati|on may &s;till reap the Advantage of their Growth and Pro|&s;perity.</Q></P>
<P>That their Prayers might be more likely to obtain Succe&s;s from being united with the Supplications of all the Colonies, they tran&s;mitted a circular Letter to the other A&s;&s;emblies, in|forming them&mdash;'That the Hou&s;e had humbly repre&s;ented to the Mini&s;try their own Sentiments; that his Maje&s;ty's high Court of Parliament is the &s;upreme Legi&s;lative Power over the whole Empire; that in all free States the Con&s;titution is fixed; and as the Supreme Legi&s;lative derives its Power and Autho|rity from the Con&s;titution, it cannot overleap the Bounds of it, without de&s;troying its own Foundation. That the Con&s;ti|tution a&s;certains and limits both Sovereignty and Allegiance, and, therefore, his Maje&s;ty's American Subjects, who ac|knowledge them&s;elves bound by the Ties of Allegiance, have an equitable Claim to the full Enjoyment of the fundamental Rules of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution. That it is an e&s;&s;ential, unalterable Right in Nature, ingrafted into the Briti&s;h Con|&s;titution as a fundamental Law, and ever held &s;acred and irre|vocable by the Subjects within the Realm, that what a Man has hone&s;tly acquired is ab&s;olutely his own, which he may freely give, but which cannot be taken from him without his

Con&s;ent. That the American Subjects may, therefore, ex|clu&s;ive of any Con&s;ideration of Charter Rights, with a decent Firmne&s;s adapted to the Character of Freemen and Subjects, a&s;&s;ert this natural con&s;titutional Right.' They add&mdash;
<Q>That as they have too much Rea&s;on to believe, that the Enemies of the Colonies have repre&s;ented them to his Maje&s;ty's Mi|ni&s;ters, and the Parliament, as factious, di&s;loyal, and &s;hew|ing a Di&s;po&s;ition to make them&s;elves independant of the Mother Country, they have taken Occa&s;ion, in the mo&s;t humble Terms, to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters, that, with regard to the People of this Province, and, as they doubt not, of all the Colonies, that Charge is unju&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, Governor Bernard laid before the Hou&s;e, on the 21&s;t of June, 1768, the following Requi&s;ition:</P>

<P>It gives great Concern to his Maje&s;ty to find, that the &s;ame Moderation which appeared by your Letter to have been a|dopted at the Beginning of the Se&s;&s;ion, in a full A&s;&s;embly, had not continued; and that in&s;tead of that Spirit of Pru|dence and Re&s;pect to the Con&s;titution, which &s;eemed at that Time to influence the Conduct of a large Majority of the Members, a thin Hou&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hou&s;e was counted, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Members were pre&s;ent.

His Maje&s;ty con&s;iders this Step as evidently tending to create unwarrantable Combina|tions, to excite an unju&s;tifiable Oppo&s;ition to the con&s;titu|tional Authority of Parliament, and to revive tho&s;e unhap|py Divi&s;ions and Di&s;tractions, which have operated &s;o pre|judicially to the true Intere&s;ts of Great-Britain and the Co|lonies. It is the King's Plea&s;ure, that &s;o &s;oon as the General Court is again a&s;&s;embled, at the Time pre&s;cribed by the Charter, you &s;hould require of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, in his Maje&s;ty's Name, to <HI>re&s;cind</HI> the Re&s;olution which gave Birth to the circular Letter from the Speaker, and to declare their Di&s;approbation of, and Di&s;&s;ent to that ra&s;h and ha&s;ty Proceeding.

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter produced univer&s;al Apprehen&s;ion and Di&s;con|tent not only in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, but in all America. A Demand, attended with a Penalty of Di&s;&s;olution, &s;eemed a Command, not a Requi&s;ition, leaving no deliberative or di&s;|cretionary Power in the A&s;&s;embly; and the Ground of it being a Petition to the King, guarded with a mo&s;t explicit Declara|tion of the &s;upreme Legi&s;lative Power of Parliament, it wore the &s;evere and dreadful Appearance of a penal Prohibition a|gain&s;t Petitioning. It was in Effect &s;aying, you &s;hall not even pre&s;ume to complain; and reducing them below the common State of Slavery, in which, if Men complain with Decency, they are heard, unle&s;s their Ma&s;ters happen to be Mon&s;ters. It warmed Moderation into Zeal, and inflamed Zeal into Rage. Yet &s;till there appeared a Di&s;po&s;ition to expre&s;s their Grievances in humble Petitions. All the A&s;&s;emblies on the Continent, in An&s;wer to a Requi&s;ition of &s;imilar Import to that already mentioned, a&s;&s;erted the Right of the Subject to petiti|on for Redre&s;s of Grievances. They joined in Petitions, &s;tating the Impo&s;itions of Taxes upon them without their Con|&s;ent, and the Abolition, of Juries in Revenue Cau&s;es, as in|tolerable Grievances, from which they prayed Relief.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay drew up a Letter to the Earl of Hill&s;borough, Secretary of State, in which they vindicate their Conduct from the A&s;per&s;ions thrown upon it in the Governor's Letters; and add,
<Q>It is an inex|pre&s;&s;ible Grief to the People of this Province, to find repeat|ed Cen&s;ures falling upon them, not from Mini&s;ters of State alone, but from Maje&s;ty it&s;elf, grounded on Letters and Ac|cu&s;ations from the Governor, a Sight of which, though re|peatedly reque&s;ted of his Excellency, is refu&s;ed. There is no Evil of this Life, which they &s;o &s;en&s;ibly feel, as the Di&s;|plea&s;ure of their Sovereign. It is a Puni&s;hment which they are &s;ure his Maje&s;ty will never inflict, but upon a Repre&s;en|tation of the Ju&s;tice of it, from his Servants, in whom he confides. Your Lord&s;hip will allow the Hou&s;e to appeal to your own Candour, upon the Hard&s;hip of their being made to &s;uffer &s;o &s;evere a Misfortune, without their ever being called to an&s;wer for them&s;elves, or even made acquainted with the Matters of Charge alleged again&s;t them; a Right, to which, by the common Rules of Society, founded in the eternal Laws of Rea&s;on and Equity, they are ju&s;tly entitled.

The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of this Province have more than once, during the Admini&s;tration of Governor Bernard, been under the Nece&s;&s;ity of entreating his Maje&s;ty's Mini|&s;ters to &s;u&s;pend their further Judgment upon &s;uch Repre&s;en|tations of the Temper of the People, and the Conduct of the A&s;&s;embly, as they were able to make appear to be injurious. The &s;ame Indulgence this Hou&s;e now beg of your Lord&s;hip; and be&s;eech your Lord&s;hip to patronize them &s;o far as to make a favourable Repre&s;entation of their Conduct to the King our Sovereign: it being the highe&s;t Ambition of this Hou&s;e, and of the People whom they repre&s;ent, to &s;tand be|fore his Maje&s;ty in their ju&s;t Character, of affectionate and loyal Subjects.</Q></P>
<P>On the 10th of June a Seizure was made of a Sloop fa&s;tened to the Wharf, with an armed Force, and the Seizure carried by Violence to the Man of War. That this Seizure was made with every Circum&s;tance of Violence and In&s;ult which could irritate a Mob, is proved by the Oaths of 13 Eye-Witne&s;&s;es, who&s;e Credibility has never been impeached. Unhappily the Irritation &s;ucceeded but too well. The Collector and Comp|troller who made the Seizure in that Manner, were treated with great Indignity and per&s;onal Injury by the Mob<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the Seizure was unju&s;t is plain from this, that they were obliged to re|&s;tore the Ve&s;&s;el, after detaining her a long Time, not being able to find any Evi|dence to &s;upport a Pro&s;ecution. The Suits too for enormous Sums again&s;t a Number of Per&s;ons, brought in the Court of Admiralty, being found in&s;upport|able, were, after long Continuance, to the great Expence and Trouble of the&s;e Per&s;ons, dropt, by a Declaration of the King's Advocate that his Maje&s;ty would pro&s;ecute no farther;&mdash;but the pro&s;ecuted could obtain no Co&s;ts or Damages, for &s;o is the Law.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame Time the Captain of the Men of War lying in the Harbour at Bo&s;ton, pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Seamen belonging to the Town, in Violation of an Act of Parliament for the En|couragement of Trade to America, which &s;ays,
<Q>No Mari|ner, or other Per&s;on, who &s;hall &s;erve on board, or be re|tained to &s;erve on board, any Privateer, or Trading Ship or Ve&s;&s;el, that &s;hall be employed in any Part of America, nor any Mariner, or Per&s;on, being on Shore in any Part thereof, &s;hall be liable to be impre&s;&s;ed or taken away, by any Officer or Officers of or belonging to her Maje&s;ty's Ships of War.</Q></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, to prevent the Tumults which might be apprehended from &s;o dangerous an Infraction of Law, were a&s;&s;embled, and drew up a Petition to the Governor, praying his Interpo&s;ition to prevent &s;uch alarming Outrages.
<PB N="15" REF="013282_0014_0F9049481873A0D8">
The Governor, however, refu&s;ed upon various Pretexts, to interfere.</P>
<P>The following Words of their Petition will &s;hew to what a State of Alarm, Anxiety, and De&s;pair, the&s;e Proceedings had reduced them.
<Q>Dutiful Petitions, &s;ay they, have been preferred to our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign, to which (tho' to the great Con&s;ternation of the People, we now learn they have been cruelly and infidiou&s;ly prevented from reaching the Royal Pre&s;ence) we waited to receive a gracious An&s;wer, with the greate&s;t Attention to the Public Peace, until we find our&s;elves invaded with an armed Force, &s;eizing, im|pre&s;&s;ing, and impri&s;oning the Per&s;ons of our Fellow Subjects, contrary to expre&s;s Acts of Parliament. Menaces have been thrown out fit only for Barbarians, which already affect us in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Manner, and threatens us with Famine and De&s;olation, as all Navigation is ob&s;tructed, upon which alone our whole Support depends, and the Town is at this Cri&s;is in a Situation nearly &s;uch as if War were formally declared again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To contend again&s;t our Parent State is, in our Idea, the mo&s;t &s;hocking and dreadful Extremity; but tamely to re|linqui&s;h the only Security we and our Po&s;terity retain of the Enjoyment of our Lives and Properties, without one Strug|gle, is &s;o humiliating and ba&s;e, that we cannot &s;upport the Reflection. We apprehend, Sir, that it is in your Option, in your Power, and we would hope in your Inclination, to prevent this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and ju&s;tly incen&s;ed People from effect|ing too much, or from the Shame and Reproach of attempt|ing too little.</Q></P>
<P>The Riot upon the Seizure of the Sloop was exaggerated into Trea&s;on and Rebellion. The Commi&s;&s;ioners fled from the Town in pretended Fear of their Lives; Affidavits were taken in &s;ecret and <HI>ex parte,</HI> and the Comptroller Mr. Hollo|well was di&s;patched Home, to give Admini&s;tration the mo&s;t horrible Idea of the People. Governor Bernard's Letters to the Secretary of State contained a direct Charge of Trea&s;on again&s;t Forty Per&s;ons, not one of whom was pro&s;ecuted, be|cau&s;e the whole was a Forgery, calculated to meet the Change of Sy&s;tem which Governor Bernard has &s;ince informed us, they then knew had taken place at London, and encourage the rigorous Mea&s;ures which the new Sy&s;tem was to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Unhappily it &s;ucceeded too well. Troops were &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, where they landed the 1&s;t of October 1768. But a Difficulty now aro&s;e, about quartering the Troops in the Town contrary to an Act of Parliament. The Governor,
<PB N="16" REF="013282_0015_0F904948DE4FDB70">
however, &s;oon determined to cut the Knot he could not untie. He therefore i&s;&s;ued a Commi&s;&s;ion, to di&s;pen&s;e with the Law and e&s;tabli&s;h Quarters for the Troops in the Town. I &s;peak from his own Letter.</P>
<P>Thus the People &s;aw two Acts of Parliament, made for their Protection, wantonly and with Impunity violated; while tho&s;e which were to their Feelings highly unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive, were to be rigorou&s;ly executed with a Military Force. Nothing could be devi&s;ed more irritating, except the Manner in which the quartering the Soldiers was executed. They filled the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly Room, the Court Hou&s;e, and Fanueil Hall, where the Town Meetings were a&s;&s;embled. When the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly met, the main Guard was planted with a Num|ber of Field Pieces at, and pointed into the very Door of the A&s;&s;embly Hou&s;e. Every Species of In&s;ult and Outrage was&punc; as if purpo&s;ely, practi&s;ed to drive the People into &s;ome violent Acts, which &s;hould ju&s;tify the letting loo&s;e the Military upon them.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the various Violations of tho&s;e Laws which &s;hould have protected them, the Minds of the People were in the mo&s;t dangerous State of Alarm and Agitation. To prevent the de&s;tructive Commotions which might be ap|prehended from &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition, the moderate and well di&s;|po&s;ed Inhabitants of Bo&s;ton petitioned the Governor to call an A&s;&s;embly, that the popular Turbulence might be quieted by their Confidence in and Re&s;pect for their own Legi&s;lature. The Governor, however, thought proper to refu&s;e them this Relief; they therefore &s;ummoned a Convention of Deputies from the different Town&s;hips, as the only Means of compo&s;ing the Agitation of Men's Minds, (from which they otherwi&s;e expected the wor&s;t Con&s;equences,) by their Confidence in Per&s;ons deputed by them&s;elves, to enter into a wi&s;e and cool Con&s;ideration of their Grievances, and the con&s;titutional Means of obtaining Redre&s;s. The Select Men of Bo&s;ton have expre&s;&s;ed the&s;e Motives in the following Pa&s;&s;age of their cir|cular Letter:&mdash;
<Q>Deprived of the Coun&s;els of a General A&s;|&s;embly in this dark and difficult Sea&s;on, the loyal People of this Province will, we are per&s;uaded, immediately perceive the Propriety and Utility of the propo&s;ed Committee of Convention, and the &s;ound and whole&s;ome Advice that may be expected from a Number of Gentlemen cho&s;en by them|&s;elves, and in whom they may repo&s;e the greate&s;t Confidence, mu&s;t tend to the real Service of our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign, and the Welfare of his Subjects in this Province, and may happily prevent any &s;udden and unconnected Mea&s;ures,
<PB N="17" REF="013282_0016_0F90494CB19F5A98">
which, in their pre&s;ent Anxiety, and even Agony of Mind, they may be in Danger of falling into.</Q></P>
<P>The Convention met on the 22d of September 1768, and drew up an humble Petition to his Maje&s;ty, imploring Relief.
<Q>With great Sincerity &s;ay they, permit us to a&s;&s;ure your Ma|je&s;ty, that your Subjects of this Province, of which we are a Part, ever have acknowledged and &s;till continue to acknow|ledge your Maje&s;ty's High Court of Parliament the &s;upreme Legi&s;lative Power of the whole Empire. The &s;uperintend|ing Authority of which is clearly admitted in all Ca&s;es that can con&s;i&s;t with the fundamental Rights of Nature, and the Con&s;titution to which your Maje&s;ty's happy Subjects in all Parts of your Empire conceive they have a ju&s;t and equitable Claim.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is therefore with the deepe&s;t Concern that your humble Suppliants would repre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty, that your Par|liament, the Rectitude of who&s;e Intentions is never to be que&s;tioned, has thought proper to pa&s;s divers Acts, impo&s;ing Taxes on your Maje&s;ty's Subjects in America, with the &s;ole and expre&s;s Purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a Revenue. If your Maje&s;ty's Subjects here &s;hall be deprived of the Honour and Privilege of voluntarily contributing their Aid to you Maje&s;ty in &s;up|porting your Government and Authority in the Province, and defending and &s;ecuring your Rights and Territories in America, which they have always hitherto done with the utmo&s;t Chearfulne&s;s: If the&s;e Acts of Parliament &s;hall remain in Force; and your Maje&s;ty's Commons in Great Britain &s;hall continue to exerci&s;e the Power of granting the Property of their Fellow Subjects in this Province, your People mu&s;t then regret their unhappy Fate, in having only the Name left of free Subjects.</Q></P>
<P>The Troops which had landed at Bo&s;ton without the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition determined, as it was natural to expect, to make the Di&s;turbance they were di&s;appointed in not finding. They offered a Variety of In&s;ults to the peaceable Inhabitants, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their Officers was detected in attempting to excite the Negroes to rebel; till at la&s;t a Party of Soldiers under the Command of Captain Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">on, fired upon the People on the 5th of March 1769, killing Six, and wounding many more. So intolerable an Outrage a&s;&s;embled the People, who were &s;o much incen&s;ed, that it was thought prudent for the Troops to evacuate the Town.</P>
<P>The Removal of the Troops re&s;tored the Tranquillity of the Town and the Good-humour of the People, the principal of whom exerted them&s;elves to palliate the Conduct of Captain
<PB N="18" REF="013282_0017_0F90494E49AC5180">
Pre&s;ton, and obtain for him a favourable Trial. To this End, he was tried &s;eparately from the Soldiers, and he was acquitted, becau&s;e no Evidence could depo&s;e that they heard him give Orders to fire.&mdash;Indeed, the Noi&s;e of the Tumult was &s;o great, that if he had given &s;uch Orders, which he denied, none could have heard him but the Soldiers among whom he &s;tood.&mdash; When the Soldiers came to be tried, they pleaded the Orders of their Captain, which they dur&s;t not di&s;obey. And on the Belief of this as a Truth, the humane Jury acquitted them al&s;o. An In&s;tance of great Temper and Equity in a People &s;o exa&s;|perated.</P>
<P>It was not however intended that the Quiet of the Town and Province &s;hould continue long. New Modes of Irritation were applied, to drive the People into Violence and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>Mr. Robin&s;on, one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners who had attempted to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Mr. Otis, was di&s;patched to England immediately after the Affair of the 5th of March, with a Ca&s;e &s;aid to be that of Captain Pre&s;ton, though directly repugnant to what he had publi&s;hed under his own Hand. This Ca&s;e had been &s;ecretly drawn up, and was &s;ecretly tran&s;mitted. The Purpo&s;e of it was to throw the Charge of being the Aggre&s;&s;ors upon the People, and that the Soldiers fired upon them in their own De|fence, and to &s;ave the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e from being plundered. This Statement was accompanied by Minutes of Council fram|ed by the Secretary him&s;elf, and &s;ecretly &s;worn to, in which one of his Maje&s;ty's Council was repre&s;ented, as declaring that there had been a premeditated De&s;ign and Plan of a general In&s;urrection formed by the People, of which this Attack upon the Guard was the fir&s;t Step. Ab&s;urd as it was to &s;uppo&s;e that the People had planned and began to execute an In&s;ur|rection, and yet not a Man appear in Arms, for no &s;uch Thing was pretended, &s;till the Example of the Succe&s;s and Impunity with which Governor Bernard had accu&s;ed them &s;pecifically of Trea&s;on, without being able to prove a Tittle of it, was enough to encourage Governor Hutchin&s;on, and his Brother-in-law the Secretary, to repeat a &s;imilar Charge on this Occa&s;i|on, which they knew would operate for the Time, and being made &s;ecretly, they tru&s;ted it would not be known, &s;o as to meet a Refutation. Mr. Commi&s;&s;ioner Robin&s;on arrived In London, and his State. &amp;c. was circulated through the Mi|ni&s;try and Members of Parliament, and, &s;upported by his per|&s;onal Applications, inflamed them again&s;t the Province. In the mean Time, the Town proceeded to draw up their Narrative of the Affair founded upon Affidavits taken openly, with Notice given to all Per&s;ons concerned to attend and cro&s;s-exa|mine
<PB N="19" REF="013282_0018_0F9049505E30F930">
the Witne&s;&s;es. Upon this open and fair Enquiry, it appeared by the Te&s;timony of near an Hundred Per&s;ons, that the Soldiers were the Aggre&s;&s;ors, having fired upon the People without &s;ufficient Provocation, and without the Intervention of, or even application to the civil Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>It was not until October 1770, that the Repre&s;entation and Affidavit of their Secretary, Mr. Oliver, reached his Maje&s;ty's Council at Bo&s;ton, in a Pamphlet which had been publi&s;hed in London, to ju&s;tify the Proceedings of the Military on the 5th of March 1769, and accu&s;e the People. The Member to whom he had imputed the Words, which were calculated to convey the Idea of an In&s;urrection having been planned by the People, publicly made Oath, that the Secretary had mi&s;|repre&s;ented his Words, and that he never knew, or heard, or even thought of any &s;uch Plan. The other Members of Coun|cil who were pre&s;ent al&s;o made Oath, that Mr. Oliver's Account was a Mi&s;repre&s;entation; and the Council came unanimou&s;ly to the following Re&s;olutions:
<Q>That Andrew Oliver, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Secretary of this Province, by &s;ecretly taking Minutes at Council, of what was &s;aid by the Members of the Council, in their Debates, al&s;o by &s;igning a Paper con|taining tho&s;e Minutes, and further, by giving his Depo&s;i|tion to the Truth of it, has, in each and all tho&s;e In&s;tances, acted incon&s;i&s;tent with the Duty of his Office, and thereby is guilty of a Breach of Tru&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Oliver, thus &s;tigmatized, was &s;oon after appointed Lieutenant Governor of the Province. Unhappily this wore the Appearance of rewarding for his Treachery to the Council and his Enmity to the People, which tended nece&s;&s;arily to dimini&s;h the Confidence and Re&s;pect due to Government, and to &s;pread Di&s;content through the Province.</P>
<P>On the 13th of May 1770, Governor Hutchin&s;on held the A&s;&s;embly at Cambridge, obliging them to quit Bo&s;ton, where all the public Records and Conveniences for carrying on Bu|&s;ine&s;s, were lodged. The Two Hou&s;es remon&s;trated again&s;t this, not only as highly inconvenient and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to them, and an Embarra&s;&s;ment to public Bu&s;ine&s;s, but an Infringe|ment of their chartered Rights, Notwith&s;tanding this, the A&s;&s;embly was continued there for Two Se&s;&s;ions without any Rea&s;on being given but mere Will and Plea&s;ure (&s;ignified in In&s;tructions from the Mini&s;ter) and then it was adjourned to Bo&s;ton, not as an Act of Graciou&s;ne&s;s, but of Caprice.

<P>The Proceedings in England were not more conciliating.</P>
<P>Governor Bernard had, by various fal&s;e and inflammatory Repre&s;entations, concentered upon the Province the whole Force of royal and parliamentary Indignation. He had ex|pre&s;sly accu&s;ed certain Per&s;ons of a trea&s;onable De&s;ign, their Names, as he pretended, being enrolled for the Purpo&s;e, to &s;eize the Ca&s;tle and turn it again&s;t the King's Troops.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>But Governor Bernard thus armed with all the Powers of Government, was unable to &s;ub&s;tantiate his Accu&s;ation again&s;t a &s;ingle Per&s;on. The Purpo&s;es however for which the Accu|&s;ation was devi&s;ed were fully an&s;wered. An Odium had been fixed upon the People, a military Force had been &s;ent, which promi&s;ed to create the very Rebellion he had fal&s;ely declared to exi&s;t, for the Purpo&s;e of procuring that Force.</P>
<P>The Manner in which he proceeded in his Endeavours to &s;tir up Re&s;i&s;tance and create Di&s;orders, is thus de&s;cribed in the Narrative of the Town, and which he has never been able to contradict.</P>
<P><Q>Governor Bernard, without con&s;ulting the Council, having given up the State-Hou&s;e to the Troops at their Landing, they took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Chambers where the Repre&s;enta|tives of the Province and the Courts of Law held their Meet|ings; and (except the Council Chamber) of all other Parts of that Hou&s;e; in which they continued a con&s;iderable Time, to the great Annoyance of tho&s;e Courts while they &s;at and of the Merchants and Gentlemen of the Town, who had al|ways made the lower Floor of it their Exchange. They had a Right &s;o to do, as the Property of it was in the Town; but they were deprived of that Right by mere Power.&mdash;The &s;aid Governor &s;oon after, by every Stratagem and Method, but a forcible Entry, endeavoured to get Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Manufactory-Hou&s;e, to make a Barrack of it for the Troops; and for that Purpo&s;e cau&s;ed it to be be&s;ieged by the Troops, and the People in it to be u&s;ed very cruelly; which extraor|dinary Proceedings created univer&s;al Unea&s;ine&s;s, ari&s;ing from the Apprehen&s;ion that the Troops, under the Influence of &s;uch a Man, would be employed to effect the mo&s;t dange|rous Purpo&s;es; but failing of that, other Hou&s;es were pro|cured, in which, contrary to Act of Parliament, he cau&s;ed the Troops to be quartered. After their Quarters were thus &s;ettled, the Main Guard was po&s;ted at One of the &s;aid Hou&s;es, directly oppo&s;ite to, and not Twelve Yards from the State-Hou&s;e, (where the General Court and all the Law Courts for the County were held) with two Field Pieces pointed to the State-Hou&s;e. This Situation of the Main Guard and Field Pieces &s;eemed to indicate an Attack upon the Con&s;titution, and a Defiance of Law; and to be intend|ed
<PB N="22" REF="013282_0021_0F9049529287AAE8">
to affront the legi&s;lative and executive Authority of the Province.</Q></P>
<P>The General Court, at the fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ion after the Arrival of the Troops, viewed it in this Light, and applied to Governor Bernard to remove &s;uch an offence, but to no Purpo&s;e. Di&s;|gu&s;ted at &s;uch an Indignity, and at the Appearance of being under Dure&s;&s;e, they refu&s;ed to do Bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;uch a Situation, and were removed to another Place to the great Inconvenience of the Members.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the challenging the Inhabitants by Centinels po&s;ted in all Parts of the Town, occa&s;ioned many Quarrels and great Unea&s;ine&s;s. It was fully proved again&s;t Captain Wil&s;on of the 59th Regiment, that he was exciting the Ne|groes of the Town to take away their Ma&s;ter's Lives and Pro|perty, and repair to the Army for Protection. To the&s;e were added various Outrages, &s;uch as the Soldiers attacking and in|&s;ulting the Magi&s;trates of the Town, re&s;cuing their Fellows from the Peace Officers, firing loaded Mu&s;kets in the Streets to the great Alarm and Danger of the peaceable Inhabitants, and wounding Per&s;ons frequently and wantonly with their Bayonets and Cutla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e In&s;ults and Outrages did not, however, produce the In&s;urrection that was wi&s;hed; but an humble Petition from the Repre&s;entatives of the People to his Maje&s;ty again&s;t the Author of all tho&s;e Evils, Governor Bernard.</P>
<P>This Petition was voted the 27th of June 1769. The Go|vernor prorogued the A&s;&s;embly to January 10th, 1770, and came over to England. On the 25th of October, he pre&s;ent|ed a Petition to bring the Charges again&s;t him to a Hearing. In the mean time Orders were &s;ent to the Lieutenant-Gover|nor, Mr. Hutchin&s;on, to prorogue the A&s;&s;embly to the 14th of March, which was done accordingly. Notwith&s;tanding the Agent repre&s;ented the Impo&s;&s;ibility of the A&s;&s;embly even knowing that their Petition was to be heard, much le&s;s tran&s;|mitting Evidence in Support of the Allegations it contained, that this Impo&s;&s;ibility was created by the very Per&s;on accu&s;ed, and who, in the Face of that, called upon them to &s;upport their Charge, to which the Agent added an humble Prayer, that the Hearing might be deferred till convenient Time was given for the Meeting of the A&s;&s;embly and Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of E|vidence: Yet the Petition was ordered peremptorily to a Hear|ing on the 28th of February, when in Default of Evidence, the &s;everal Charges in it were declared groundle&s;s, vexatious, and &s;candalous; and that the petitioning could only be with a View of keeping up Spirit of Clamour and Di&s;content in the &s;aid Province.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="013282_0022_0F9049532D6713D0">Thus the People had the Grief and Mortification to find, that whether they were the Accu&s;ers or the Accu&s;ed, they were &s;ure of being cen&s;ured and condemned. This Man had been in&s;trumental in bringing upon them the Odium of Di&s;affection and Rebellion; he had &s;hut the Ear of the King and Parlia|ment again&s;t their Applications for Redre&s;s of Grievances; he had contributed to the having a military Force &s;ent to dragoon them; he had, in Violation of an expre&s;s Act of Parliament, quartered tho&s;e Troops in their Town, with every Circum|&s;tance of In&s;olence and Outrage; he had &s;ubjected them to the intolerable Oppre&s;&s;ion of being dragged Three Thou&s;and Miles, upon mere Su&s;picion, to &s;truggle for their Lives and Property, without Friends and without Witne&s;&s;es, again&s;t all the Force of mini&s;terial Pro&s;ecution. Yet it was conceived that to petition again&s;t &s;uch a Man could only flow from fac|tious Motives, and becau&s;e his own Agency in proroguing the A&s;&s;embly rendered it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould even know it was required of them to &s;upport their Charges again&s;t him, tho&s;e Charges were pronounced groundle&s;s and malicious. With the Feelings of Men they could not but be &s;en&s;ibly affected by the&s;e Proceedings, which, to &s;peak in the Language of the Poet, preaching to Stones would make them capable.</P>
<P>To heighten the Colouring of the&s;e Tran&s;actions, Orders were &s;ent in 1771 to the Governor, to refu&s;e his A&s;&s;ent to any Tax Bill which &s;hould include the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Cu&s;toms. The&s;e Gentlemen, who&s;e officious and incendiary Zeal again&s;t that Country had rai&s;ed them to Office, were to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed more than the fir&s;t Men in this Country, by an Exemption from &s;haring in the common Burdens of the Community.</P>
<P>In 1772, the Judges' Salaries were ordered to be paid out of the extorted Revenue, and not by Grants from the Repre|&s;entatives of the People, as had been the con&s;tant U&s;age. Nothing could alarm the People more than this E&s;tabli&s;hment, as it &s;truck at once at the very Root of the impartial Admini|&s;tration of Ju&s;tice. The Inhabitants of Bo&s;ton &s;ay, in their Addre&s;s to the Governor, that
<Q>as the Judges hold their Places <HI>during Plea&s;ure,</HI> this E&s;tabli&s;hment was big with the mo&s;t fatal Evils.</Q></P>
<P>Both Governor Bernard and Governor Hutchin&s;on had re|peatedly repre&s;ented the Di&s;content and Oppo&s;ition, as ari&s;ing from a factious Few in Bo&s;ton; and that the Province in ge|neral were aver&s;e to their Mea&s;ures, and &s;atisfied with their Situation. To a&s;certain the general Sentiments of the Peo|ple, a Committee was appointed at Bo&s;ton, to repre&s;ent their Sen&s;e of Grievances to the re&s;t of the Town&s;hips, and take their
<PB N="24" REF="013282_0023_0F904954B7BB8460">
Opinion upon them. This was accordingly done, the 2d of November 1772. The re&s;t of the Towns concurred mo&s;t unanimou&s;ly in the &s;ame Sen&s;e of Grievances, and De&s;ire of having them redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 6th of January 1773, Governor Hutchin&s;on, in his Speech to the Two Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly, challenges them to a Controver&s;y upon the &s;upreme legi&s;lative Authority of Parlia|ment. The A&s;&s;embly, in their An&s;wer, take up the Que&s;tion as a Point of Argument and Speculation refuting his Argu|ments, and controverting his Conclu&s;ions. It was a Que&s;tion, which, of them&s;elves, they had never ventured to agitate, and they entered into it now when publicly provoked to it, with avowed Reluctance.&mdash;'We have the highe&s;t Re&s;pect,' &s;ay they,
<Q>for that augu&s;t Body the Parliament, and do not pre|&s;ume to pre&s;cribe the exact Limits of its Authority. Yet, with the Deference that is due to it, we are humbly of Opinion, that as all human Authority, in the Nature of it, is and ought to be limited, it cannot con&s;titutionally extend, for the Rea&s;ons we have above &s;ugge&s;ted, to the levying of Taxes in any Form on his Maje&s;ty's Subjects of this Pro|vince. The&s;e are great and profound Que&s;tions. It is the Grief of this Hou&s;e, that by the ill Policy of a late injudicious Admini&s;tration, America has been driven into the Contem|plation of them. And we cannot but expre&s;s our Concern, that your Excellency by your Speech has reduced us to the unhappy Alternative, either of appearing by your Silence to acquie&s;ce in your Excellency's Sentiments, or of thus freely di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this Point.</Q></P>
<P>The mo&s;t charitable Con&s;truction of this Conduct in the Governor is, that it was promoted by indi&s;creet Zeal; the mo&s;t probable Conjecture is that it was a Snare laid for the Two Hou&s;es to draw them into &s;uch a Denial of the &s;upreme legi&s;lative Authority of this Country, as might expo&s;e them to its utmo&s;t Indignation. Whether it aro&s;e from Malice or In|di&s;cretion, mo&s;t certainly it was courting the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a Que&s;tion which Common Sen&s;e and Common Hone&s;ty would have wi&s;hed to cover with a &s;acred and impenetrable Veil. But the Two Hou&s;es, though compelled into the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Right as a &s;peculative Point, had no Idea of drawing it into Que&s;tion practically. For in March following, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives tran&s;mitted a Letter to the Secretary of State, in which they thus &s;tate the Exerci&s;e of that Power, which was que&s;tionable as to the Right and grievous in its Operation.</P>

<P>The Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Union and Harmony that formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Breat Britain and her Colonies is earne&s;tly to be wi&s;hed by the Friends of both. As your Lord&s;hip is one of them, the Two Hou&s;es of the A&s;&s;embly of this Province beg leave to addre&s;s you. The original Cau&s;es of the Interruption of that Union and Harmony may pro|bably be found in the Letters &s;ent from hence to Admini|&s;tration, and to other Gentlemen of Influence in Parliament, &s;ince the Appointment of Sir Francis Bernard to the Go|vernment of this Province; and there is great Rea&s;on to apprehend, that he and his Coadjutors originally recom|mended and laid the Plans for the e&s;tabli&s;hing the American Revenue, out of which they expected large Stipends and Appointments for them&s;elves, and which, through their In|&s;trumentality, has been the Occa&s;ion of all the Evils that have &s;ince taken place.</P>
<P>When we had humbly addre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty, and petitioned both Hou&s;es of Parliament, repre&s;enting our Grievances, and praying for the Repeal of the Revenue Acts, the like In&s;tru|ments, and probably the &s;ame, exerted them&s;elves to prevent tho&s;e Petitions being laid before his Maje&s;ty and the Parlia|ment, or to fru&s;trate the Prayer of them. Of this we have ju&s;t had &s;ome new and unexpected Evidence from original Letters of Governor Hutchin&s;on and Lieutenant-Governor Oliver; in which the former particularly and expre&s;sly, by
<PB N="26" REF="013282_0025_0F90495639524160">
his Letter of the 10th of December 1768, endeavoured, in Co-operation with Governor, Bernard, to fru&s;trate a Petition of a number of the Council for the Repealing tho&s;e Acts, and to procure his Maje&s;ty's Cen&s;ure on the Petitioners; and the Letters of the latter, by the di&s;advantageous Idea conveyed by them of the Two Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly, manife&s;tly tended to create a Prejudice again&s;t any Petitions coming from a Body of &s;uch a Character; and his Letter of the 11th of May 1768 in particular, mentions the Petition of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives to his Maje&s;ty, and their Letters to divers noble Lords, with &s;uch Circum&s;tances as had a Ten|dency to defeat the Petition, and render the Letters of no Effect.</P>
<P>It is now manife&s;t, my Lord, what Practices and Arts have been u&s;ed to mi&s;lead Admini&s;tration, both in the fir&s;t Propo&s;al of American Revenue Acts, and in the Continu|ance of them: But when they had lo&s;t their Force, and there appeared, under the Influence of your Lord&s;hip, a Di&s;|po&s;ition in Parliament to repeal tho&s;e Acts, his Excellency Governor Hutchin&s;on, in his Speech at the Opening of the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of the General Court, was plea&s;ed to throw out new Matter for Contention and Debate, and to call on the Two Hou&s;es in &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ing Manner as amounted to lit|tle &s;hort of a Challenge to an&s;wer him. In &s;uch a Dilemma were they brought by the Speech, that they were under a Nece&s;&s;ity of giving &s;uch An&s;wers to it as they did, or hav|ing their Conduct con&s;trued into an Acquie&s;cence with the Doctrines contained in it, which would have been an im|plicit Acknowledgment that the Province was in a State of Subjection differing very little from Slavery. The An&s;wers were the Effect of Nece&s;&s;ity, and this Nece&s;&s;ity occa&s;ioned great Grief to the Two Hou&s;es. The People of this Pro|vince, my Lord, are true and faithful Subjects of his Ma|je&s;ty, and think them&s;elves happy in their Connection with Great Britain.</P>
<P>They would rejoice at the Re&s;toration of the Harmony and Good Will that once &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Parent State and them: But it is in vain to expect this Happine&s;s during the Continuance of their Grievances, and while their Char|ter Rights, one after another, are wre&s;ted from them. Among the&s;e Rights is the &s;upporting of the Officers of the Crown by Grants from the A&s;&s;embly; and in an e&s;pecial Manner, the &s;upporting of the Judges in the &s;ame Way, on who&s;e Judgment the Province is dependent in the mo&s;t important Ca&s;es, of Life, Liberties, and Property. If Warrants have

not yet been, or if they already have been i&s;&s;ued, we earne&s;tly beg the Favour of your Lord&s;hip's Interpo&s;ition to &s;uppre&s;s or recal them. <HI>If your Lord&s;hip &s;hould conde&s;cend to a&s;k what are the Means of re&s;toring the Harmony &s;o much de&s;ired, we &s;hould an&s;wer in a Word, that we are humbly of Opinion, if Things were brought to the general State in which they &s;tood at the Con|clu&s;ion of the late War, it would re&s;tore the happy Harmony which at that Time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip's Appointment to be Principal Secretary of State for the American Department has given the Colonies the highe&s;t Satisfaction. They think it a happy Omen, and that it will be productive of American Tranquillity, con|&s;i&s;tent with their Rights as Briti&s;h Subjects.

<P>In the mean time the Repre&s;entatives of the People have omitted no Opportunity of laying their Griefs at the Foot of the Throne, with the mo&s;t humble Supplications for Relief.</P>
<P>Their Petition to the King in 1772 &s;peaks thus:&mdash;
<Q>The In|habitants of this Province had long &s;hared in the Ble&s;&s;ings of good Government under the mild Admini&s;tration of your Maje&s;ty and your royal Predece&s;&s;ors, until your Briti&s;h Par|liament &s;aw fit to pa&s;s divers Acts for the expre&s;s Purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a Revenue in America, without the Con&s;ent of your Subjects inhabiting therein. It was this that filled the Minds of your Subjects of this Province with Di&s;content; being grieved that your Maje&s;ty's Council &s;hould advi&s;e to a Mea&s;ure, which in a great Degree deprives them of the Rights and Liberties of free and natural Subjects granted to them by the Charter. The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives did, in the Year 1768, demon&s;trate to your Maje&s;ty this grievous Infraction of their deare&s;t Rights of Engli&s;hmen. Our
<PB N="28" REF="013282_0027_0F904957C366E150">
Hearts are too deeply impre&s;&s;ed with Loyalty and Affection to your Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Family to imagine, that a Failure of the Redre&s;s then prayed for, can be imputed to any Want of paternal Regard in your royal Mind for all your Subjects. It becomes us rather to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Petition and Complaint, unfortunately for us, did not reach the Throne.</Q></P>
<P>They repeat the &s;ame Subject of Complaint in their Petition of 1773, in the&s;e Words:
<Q>The Parliament of Great-Bri|tain, in which your Subjects here are not and cannot be re|pre&s;ented, hath exerci&s;ed a Power of rai&s;ing a Revenue with|in the Province, to the great Grief and Di&s;tre&s;s of your Ma|je&s;ty's People, and, we conceive, in Repugnance to the Royal Charter. Your Petitioners did, at the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of this A&s;&s;embly, make their humble Supplication to your Ma|je&s;ty, praying the Interpo&s;ition of your royal Clemency for the Redre&s;s of their Grievances; but we know not whether our Petition was ever laid before your Maje&s;ty.</Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Cau&s;es of Unea&s;ine&s;s and Irritation already men|tioned, &s;undry In&s;tructions have been &s;ent to the Governor of this Province, &s;ince the Year 1770, which tended to keep the People in continual Alarm and Di&s;content. The Nature of the&s;e In&s;tructions is fully explained in the following Extract, from a Letter of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, to the Earl of Dartmouth.</P>
<Q><P>We cannot refrain from expre&s;&s;ing our &s;tronge&s;t Appre|hen&s;ions, that the In&s;tructions which have of late been given to the Governor by the Mini&s;try, if per&s;i&s;ted in, will entire|ly de&s;troy our Liberties, and &s;ubvert our happy Con&s;tituti|on. In pur&s;uance of In&s;tructions, the Garri&s;on of our prin|cipal Fortre&s;s, Ca&s;tle William, has been withdrawn, and a Garri&s;on of his Maje&s;ty's regular Troops, over whom the Governor has declared he has no Controul, placed in their Stead. By this Means the Governor has no longer that Command of this Fortre&s;s, which he is ve&s;ted with by the Royal Charter. Upon this Occa&s;ion we would refer it to your Lord&s;hip's Con&s;ideration, whether the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Office, and Power of a Military Commander in Chief, not &s;ubordinate to, but independent of, uncontrouled by, and in &s;ome In&s;tances &s;uper&s;eding the Power and Authorities already granted to the Governors and Captains General of the Provinces, with a Juri&s;diction extending over the whole Continent of America, is not repugnant to Law, and to the Principles of Prudence and &s;ound Policy; and mu&s;t not be very alarming to all tho&s;e who have any Regard for the Li|berties of the Con&s;titution, either of Great-Britain or of the Colonies.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="013282_0028_0F9049592F45D268">
By virtue of In&s;tructions, the Honourable his Maje&s;ty's Council are forbid to meet and tran&s;act Matters of a Public Concern, as a Council of Advice to the Governor, unle&s;s called by the Governor; and if they &s;hould &s;o meet at any Time, the Governor is ordered to Negative them at the next Election.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Charter fully authori&s;es and empow|ers the General Court to impo&s;e and levy proportionable and rea&s;onable Rates and Taxes upon the E&s;tates and Per&s;ons of all and every the Proprietors and Inhabitants of the Province, yet the Governor has been In&s;tructed not to give his Con|&s;ent to any Law or Laws, by which the Commi&s;&s;ioners, or any Per&s;on employed in the King's Service, who&s;e Offices have no peculiar Relation to this Province, &s;hall be taxed. This we conceive is repugnant to the Privilege granted by Charter, which makes the general Court the only proper Judges, who are to be exempted from Taxes.&mdash;By In|&s;truction al&s;o, the Governor is forbid to give his Con&s;ent, upon any Pretence whatever, to any Vote or Order for the Payment of any Salary or Allowance to any Per&s;on or Per|&s;ons appointed to negotiate the Affairs of the Province in Great-Britain, other than &s;uch as &s;hall be thereunto ap|pointed by an Act of the whole Legi&s;lature, or by a Vote of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, to which the Governor and Council re&s;pectively have given their Concurrence. Of what Service can &s;uch an Agent be to the Province, e&s;peci|ally while Matters which &s;o nearly affect the very Funda|mentals of the Con&s;titution are in Di&s;pute. For if he mu&s;t receive his In&s;tructions from all the Branches of the Legi&s;la|ture, as may, and undoubtedly will be in&s;i&s;ted on, can it be expected they will agree in a Set of In&s;tructions in our pre|&s;ent critical Situation? If it &s;hould be &s;aid that either Branch would have a Right to in&s;truct the Agent &s;eparately, yet it may happen, e&s;pecially if the Agent be equally obliged to pur&s;ue his In&s;tructions from each Branch, that in the mo&s;t important Matters the In&s;tructions will be various and con|tradictory, which mu&s;t totally deprive us of any Benefit from his Agency, in all &s;uch Ca&s;es. In &s;hort, it is defeating us of every valuable Purpo&s;e, as we conceive, that might ac|crue to the Province by an Agent at the Court of Great-Britain. Moreover, with &s;uch an Agent, under the Direc|tion of the three Branches, will it not be utterly impractica|ble for the A&s;&s;embly ever to lay before their Sovereign their Complaints again&s;t the corrupt and arbitrary Admini&s;tration of a Governor? Self-defence, my Lord, whether it regard In|dividuals or Bodies of Men, is the fir&s;t Law of Nature. The
<PB N="30" REF="013282_0029_0F90495A2C12CA88">
Right of Defence includes all Means requi&s;ite and proper for that Defence, and con&s;equently a Right to appoint and &s;up|port their own Defender. It mu&s;t therefore appear, that the Hou&s;e has, more e&s;pecially when their deare&s;t Rights are at Stake, a clear and ju&s;t Right to appoint an Agent for them&s;elves, without the Concurrence of the Governor.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be apparent to your Lord&s;hip, that while our Judges hold their Commi&s;&s;ions during Plea&s;ure only, if they are to receive their Support from the Crown, independent of the free Grants of the People, they will be dependent on the Crown both for their Places and Support; and we &s;hould &s;ubmit it to your Lord&s;hip's Con&s;ideration, whether this be not a Situation in which no Man could wi&s;h to be, who is properly impre&s;&s;ed with a Sen&s;e of human Depravity, or who has a due Regard for Ju&s;tice. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, what Deci&s;ions mu&s;t the People expect, when the Di&s;pute lies between Pre|rogative and Privilege?</P>
<P>We beg your Lord&s;hips candid Attention to the un|happy Circum&s;tances of the Province; and hope the Re|pre&s;entation we have made of our Grievances will meet with a favourable Reception. The Colonies are far from being in&s;en&s;ible of their Happine&s;s, in being conducted with the Mother Country, and of the mutual Benefits derived from it; and &s;hall at all Times e&s;teem it our Glory to cultivate, as far as our Influence may extend, the warme&s;t Sentiments of Loyalty and Affection to his Maje&s;ty, and to promote a happy Union and Harmony between the Subjects of Great Britain and tho&s;e of the Colonies. We are greatly aggrieved. We think it our indi&s;pen&s;able Duty to point out to your Lord&s;hip our Grievances; we have frequently done it heretofore to Admini&s;tration. We have failed of Succe&s;s. In&s;tead of be|ing relieved, our Grievances have been increa&s;ed. Our Con|&s;tituents are ju&s;tly and univer&s;ally alarmed, and filled with anxious Concern at the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Affairs.</P></Q>
<P>It is proper to &s;ay a &s;ingle Word about Agency, Mr. De Bardt was appointed by the Hou&s;e only, 7th November 1765; he was admitted, without the lea&s;t Que&s;tion, as Agent, at the Board of Trade, under different Admini&s;trations, and Gover|nor Bernard gave his A&s;&s;ent to a Bill for paying his Salary &s;o late as the Year 1768. It happened to be the Duty of the Agent &s;oon after to convey the Complaints of his Con&s;tituents to the Throne, both again&s;t the Mini&s;ter and the Governor. In this Bu&s;ine&s;s a faithful hone&s;t Agent was found exceedingly trouble&s;ome. Such Repre&s;entations were therefore made by the Governor, and &s;uch In&s;tructions &s;ent by the Mini&s;ter, as
<PB N="31" REF="013282_0030_0F90495AB1AF7798">
incapaciated the Hou&s;e from paying their Agent, unle&s;s they would have one approved of by the very Per&s;ons again&s;t whom it might be his Duty to act. This Mea&s;ure needs no Com|ment. It is not in human Depravity to devi&s;e an Act of more gro&s;s Inju&s;tice, than that of debarring Men of the Means of de&s;ending them&s;elves when accu&s;ed, or of complaining when injured.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e repeated Di&s;appointments and accumulated Grievances rankling in the Minds of the People, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives received, through the Hands of their Agent, &s;ome original Letters written by their Governor and Lieutenant Governor to Per&s;ons of Influence in England. The&s;e Letters contained a mo&s;t unfavourable Repre&s;entation of the Princi|ples and Proceedings of the People, and of their Repre&s;enta|tives. They called for Puni&s;hment upon Individuals, and Re&s;traints upon the whole by an Abridgment of their Liberties. The Means of altering the Charter, and of new modelling the Con&s;titution of the Colony, &s;o as to render the Crown ab&s;o|lute, were pointed out with a malignant Ability. Strong In|junctions were added of the Nece&s;&s;ity of finding out &s;ome Way, 'to TAKE OFF the original Incendaries,' le&s;t they &s;hould 'continue to in&s;til their Poi&s;on into the Minds of the People.'</P>
<P>The&s;e Letters were read with Grief, A&s;toni&s;hment, and Indignation. The People viewed the Writers of them in the mo&s;t criminal Light. They con&s;idered them as the intentional Authors of all their pa&s;t Calamities, and the Enemies of their future Peace and Happine&s;s. What aggravated the Crime was, that the&s;e Men were their Countrymen, had always profe&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t Wi&s;hes for the Welfare of the Province and of the People; and in con&s;equence of tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions, had ob|tained their highe&s;t Confidence and Re&s;pect. This Character was peculiarly competent to one of the Letter Writers. He was the Strafford of his Time. The &s;ecret Manner in which the Letters had been conveyed, made the Treachery Tenfold more terrible and offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives voted an humble Petition to the King for the Removal of the&s;e Governors,
<Q>who had rendered them&s;elves ju&s;tly obnoxious to the People, and en|tirely lo&s;t their Confidence.</Q>
&mdash;His Maje&s;ty's Council in the Province re&s;olved, at the &s;ame Time, That it would be for his Maje&s;ty's Service, and the Peace of the Province to remove them.</P>
<P>This Petition was heard before a Committee of the Lords of the Privy Council, where an illiberal Lawyer was hired and permitted to abu&s;e the Petitioners and their Agent, in the
<PB N="32" REF="013282_0031_0F90495B721793F0">
gro&s;&s;e&s;t Terms Scurrility could invent; and the Lords report|ed
<Q>That the Petition was groundle&s;s, vexatious and &s;can|dalous, and calculated only for the &s;editious Purpo&s;es of keeping up a Spirit of Clamour and Di&s;content in the Pro|vince. That nothing had been laid before them which did or could, in their Opinion, in any Manner, or in any Degree impeach the Honour, Integrity or conduct of the Governor or Lieutenant Governor.</Q></P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve that Mr. Hutchin&s;on, in his Hi&s;tory, has de&s;cribed his own Situation in that of Governor Dudley, in the Year 1705.
<Q>The People (&s;ays he) in general, looked upon him as an Enemy, even to the Privileges of the new Charter. Sir Henry A&s;hur&s;t procured an original Letter, wrote by the Governor's Son Paul, who was then Attorney General, to Mr. Floyd, and &s;ent it to New England, in which were the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>the Government and College are di&s;po&s;ed of here in Chimney Corners, and private Meetings, as confidently as can be&mdash;This Country will never be worth living in, for Gen|tlemen and Lawyers, till the Charter is taken away.</HI> Copies were di&s;per&s;ed about the Province, and the Letter was &s;oon after printed.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Henry A&s;hur&s;t was Agent for the Province, and a Man of high Character, Credit, and Honour. Mr Hutchin&s;on pa&s;&s;es no Cen&s;ure on this Action, neither does it appear to have been cen&s;ured at the Time. Not that Wedderburns were wanting, but that the Times did not countenance their Scur|rility.</P>
<P>In December 1773, a large Quantity of Tea, &s;hipped by the Ea&s;t India Company, with the Duty impo&s;ed by Parliament to be paid in America, arrived at Bo&s;ton. All the Colonies to which the Tea under the &s;ame Circum&s;tances was de&s;tined, had publicly re&s;olved that it &s;hould not be admitted. The Directors of the Ea&s;t India Company had been forewarned of its Fate, and an Offer made before it was &s;hipped to pay the Duty here. But the Tea was de&s;tined to produce the Com|motions it occa&s;ioned, and the Offer was rejected. The Peo|ple met in Bo&s;ton, and in&s;i&s;ted on the Tea being &s;ent back. The Governor refu&s;ed to permit the Ship to return, upon which &s;ome Per&s;ons in Digui&s;e de&s;troyed it in the Night. It is manife&s;t that the Governor intended to urge them to this Ex|tremity or el&s;e he would have acted, as General Haldiman writes he expected Governor Tryon would do,
<Q>to prevent dangerous Extremities, rather chu&s;e to permit the Teas &s;hould be &s;ent back to England.</Q>
The &s;ame was permitted at Phi|ladelphia, and the Tea actually &s;ent back on the 27th of De+cember.
<PB N="33" REF="013282_0032_0F90495C2F6967C8">
General Haldiman declares this was the Determina|tion of every Colony.
<Q>The &s;everal Governors (&s;ays he) of other Provinces, will undoubtedly make your Lord&s;hip ac|quainted with the Oppo&s;ition intended, and made in their re&s;pective Governments again&s;t the landing the Tea; the whole proceeding from an almo&s;t unanimous Re&s;olution not to pay any new Duties or Taxes laid by the Parliament of Great-Britain.</Q></P>
<P>Governor Hutchin&s;on's Son and his near Relation were the Con&s;ignees of the Tea, and the Per&s;ons mo&s;t intere&s;ted in the Sale of it. As the Con&s;ignees had refu&s;ed to re&s;ign the Tea, their Windows were broke by the Mob. Upon this they ap|plied to his Maje&s;ty's Council for Protection, who came to the following Report upon the Application.</P>
<Q><P>In Council Nov. 27, 1773, The Petition of Richard Clark, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and others (to whom the Ea&s;t-India Company have con&s;igned a Quantity of their Tea) being referred to this Day, the &s;ame was taken up; and after long Debates, Mr. Danforth, Mr. Bowdoin, Mr. Dexter, and Mr. Win|throp, were appointed a Committee thereon, who reported, and the Report after Debate was referred for further Con&s;i|deration to Monday next, at Ten o'Clock, A. M.</P>
<P>Monday, Nov. 29, 1773. The &s;aid Report was again con&s;idered, and after &s;ome Amendments unanimou&s;ly agreed to.</P>
<P>It is as follows:</P>
<P>Previous to the Con&s;ideration of the Petition before the Board, they would make a few Ob&s;ervations occa&s;ioned by the Subject of it. The Situation of Things between Great-Britain and the Colonies has been for &s;ome Years pa&s;t very unhappy. Parliament on the one hand has been taxing the Colonies, and they on the other have been petitioning and remon&s;trating again&s;t it; apprehending they have con&s;tituti|onally an exclu&s;ive Right of taxing them&s;elves, and that without &s;uch a Right their Condition would be but little better than Slavery. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e Sentiments, every new Mea&s;ure of Parliament, tending to e&s;tabli&s;h and con|firm a Tax on them, renews and increa&s;es their Di&s;tre&s;s; and it is particularly increa&s;ed by the Act lately made, em|powering the Ea&s;t India Company to &s;hip their Tea to America.</P>
<P>This Act in a commercial View they think introductive of Monopolies, and tending to bring on them the exten&s;ive Evils thence ari&s;ing: But their great Objection to it is from its being manife&s;tly intended (though that Intention is not expre&s;&s;ed therein) more effectually to &s;ecure the Payment of
<PB N="34" REF="013282_0033_0F90495DE1741E10">
the Duty on Tea, laid by an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the 7th Year of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, intitled,
<Q>An Act for granting certain Duties in the Briti&s;h Colonies and Plantations in America;</Q>
which Act in its Operation deprives the Coloni&s;ts of the Right above-mentioned (the exclu&s;ive Right of taxing them|&s;elves) which they hold to be &s;o e&s;&s;ential an one, that it can|not be taken away, or given up, without their being de|graded, or degrading them&s;elves below the Character of Men. It not only deprives them of that Right, hut enacts that the Monies ari&s;ing from the Duties granted by it may be applied
<Q>as his Maje&s;ty or his Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hall think proper or nece&s;&s;ary, for defraying the Charges of the Admini&s;trati|on of Ju&s;tice, and the Support of the Civil Government, within all or any of the &s;aid Colonies or Plantations.</Q></P>
<P>This Clau&s;e of the Act has already operated in &s;ome of the Colonies, and in this Colony in particular, with regard to the Support of Civil Government, and thereby has operated in Di|minution of its Charter Rights, to the great Grief of the good People of it, who have been, and &s;till are, greatly alarmed by repeated Reports, that it is to have a further Operation with re&s;pect to the defraying the Charge of the Admini&s;tra|tion of Ju&s;tice, which would not only be a further Diminu|tion of tho&s;e Rights, but tend in all con&s;titutional Que&s;tions, and in many other Ca&s;es of Importance, to bias the Judges again&s;t the Subject. They humbly rely on the Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s of his Maje&s;ty for the Re&s;titution and Pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e Rights.</P>
<P>This &s;hort State of Facts the Board thought nece&s;&s;ary to be given, to &s;hew the Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent great Unea&s;ine&s;s, which is not confined to this Neighbourhood, but is general and exten&s;ive. The People think their exclu&s;ive Right of taxing them&s;elves by their Repre&s;entatives infringed and vio|lated by the Act above-mentioned; that the new Act, em|powering the Ea&s;t-India Company to import their Tea into America, confirms that Violation, and is a new Effort, not only more effectually to &s;ecure the Payment of the Tea Duty, but lay a Foundation for the enhancing it; and in a like Way, if this &s;hould &s;ucceed, to lay other Taxes on A|merica; that it is in its Attendants and Con&s;equences ruin|ous to the Liberties and Properties of them&s;elves, and their Po&s;terity; that as their numerous Petitions for Relief have been rejected, the &s;aid new Act demon&s;trates an Unwilling|ne&s;s in Mini&s;try that Parliament &s;hould grant them Relief; that this is the Source of their Di&s;tre&s;s that borders on De|&s;pair; and that they know not where to apply for Relief.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="013282_0034_0F90495EA03E5560">
The&s;e being the Sentiments of the People, it is become the indi&s;pen&s;able Duty of the Board to mention them, that the Occa&s;ion of the late Demands on Mr. Clark and others (the Agents for the Ea&s;t-India Company) and of the con|&s;equent Di&s;turbances, might appear: And we mention them, not to ju&s;tify tho&s;e Di&s;turbances, the Authors of which we have advi&s;ed &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted, but to give a ju&s;t Idea of the Ri&s;e of them.</P>
<P>On this Occa&s;ion, Ju&s;tice impels us to declare, that the People of this Town and Province, though they have a high Sen&s;e of Liberty, derived from the Manners, the Example and Con&s;titution of the Mother Country, have, till the late Parliamentary Taxations of the Colonies, been as free from Di&s;turbances as any People whatever.</P>
<P>This Repre&s;entation the Board thought nece&s;&s;ary to be made prior to their taking Notice of the Petition of the Agents above-mentioned; to the Con&s;ideration of which they now proceed.</P>
<P>The Petitioners
<Q>beg Leave to re&s;ign them&s;elves, and the Property committed to their Care, to his Excellency and the Board, as Guardians and Protectors of the People, praying that Mea&s;ures may be directed to for the landing and &s;ecuring the Tea, &amp;c.</Q>
With regard to the per&s;onal Protection of the Petitioners, the Board have not been in|formed, that they have applied for it to any of the Ju&s;tices of the Peace; within who&s;e Department it is to take Cognizance of the Ca&s;e of the Petitioners, and of all other Breaches of the Peace; they being ve&s;ted by Law with all the Authority nece&s;&s;ary for the Protection of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects. In the principal In&s;tance of Abu&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of their Windows were broken.</NOTE>, of which they complain, the Board have already advi&s;ed, that the Authors &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted according to Law; and they do advi&s;e the &s;ame in the other In&s;tances mentioned in their Petition.</P>
<P>With regard to the Tea committed to the Care of the Pe|titioners, the Board have no Authority to take either that or any other Merchandize out of their Care; and &s;hould they do it, or give any Order or Advice concerning it, and a Lo&s;s en&s;ue, they apprehend they &s;hould make them&s;elves re&s;pon|&s;ible for it. With re&s;pect to the Prayer of the Petition,
<Q>that Mea&s;ures may be directed to for landing and &s;ecuring the Tea,</Q>
the Board would ob&s;erve on it, that the Duty on the Tea becomes payable, and mu&s;t be paid, or &s;ecured to
<PB N="36" REF="013282_0035_0F90495F2E734BE0">
be paid, on its being landed. And &s;hould they direct or advi&s;e to any Mea&s;ure for landing it, they would of cour&s;e advi&s;e to a Mea&s;ure for procuring the Payment of the Duty, and therefore be advi&s;ing to a Mea&s;ure incon&s;i&s;tent with the declared Sentiment of both Hou&s;es in the la&s;t Winter Se&s;&s;ion of the General Court, which they apprehend to be altoge|ther inexpedient and improper.</P>
<P>The Board, however, on this Occa&s;ion a&s;&s;ure your Ex|cellency, that as they have &s;een, with Regret, &s;ome late Di&s;turbances, and have advi&s;ed to the pro&s;ecuting the Au|thors of them, &s;o they will, in all legal Methods, endeavour, to the utmo&s;t of their Power, to prevent them in future.</P>
<P>Whereupon advi&s;ed, That his Excellency renew his Or|ders to his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and o|ther Peace Officers, to exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t for the Security of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, the Pre&s;ervation of Peace and good Order, and for preventing all Offences a|gain&s;t the Law.</P></Q>
<P>On the 18th of February 1774, the whole Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives waited on the Governor with a &s;econd Petition, for the Removal of the Chief Ju&s;tice, who had rendered him&s;elf incapable, by accepting a Salary from the Crown, at who&s;e Will he al&s;o held his Place. They &s;ay,
<Q>Your Excellency will plea&s;e to con&s;ider that this Hou&s;e is well acquainted with the general Sen&s;e of their Con&s;tituents in this Matter; and we can now a&s;&s;ure you, that the Continuance of the Chief Ju&s;tice in his Place, will increa&s;e the Unea&s;ine&s;s of the Peo|ple without Doors, and endanger the public Tranquillity. We therefore earne&s;tly intreat your Excellency, that while we are in this In&s;tance employing the Powers with which we are entru&s;ted in promoting the Tranquillity and good Order of Government, "we may," agreeably to your De|claration in your Speech to both Hou&s;es,
<Q>find that you are ready to give your Con&s;ent to a Reque&s;t of the Hou&s;e intended for that and other great and important Purpo&s;es:</Q>
And that your Excellency will immediately take every Step for the Removal of the Chief Ju&s;tice from the &s;uperior Court.</Q></P>
<P>The Governor returned them a po&s;itive Denial, accompa|nied with a curious Piece of Equivocation. The Hou&s;e had prayed that he would take the Advice of his Maje&s;ty's Council upon their Petition, conformable to the Charter.&mdash;To which he an&s;wers, That though he was by Charter to act with the Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Council, yet the &s;ummoning of the Council was <HI>in his Di&s;cretion.</HI> Thus was the protective Provi&s;ion of the Charter effectually evaded.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="013282_0036_0F8FB8AE44D388E0">This is a full and fair State of the Proceedings in and re|&s;pecting the Province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, from the Year 1762 to 1774.</P>
<P>The candid Reader will judge what Cau&s;es of Di&s;content have been given them, and whether they have operated beyond their natural Bounds. If they have been particularly unquiet, they have al&s;o been particularly irritated and injured. Imagin|ing our&s;elves in their Situation, will, I believe, prevent us from &s;everely cen&s;uring their Conduct.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t that they have con&s;tantly expre&s;&s;ed their Com|plaints in Petitions conceived in the mo&s;t mea&s;ured Language of Subordination and Re&s;pect. That they have repeatedly acknowledged the &s;upreme legi&s;lative Authority of Parliament. That the only In&s;tance in which they &s;eem to have que&s;tioned it, was in a mere &s;peculative Di&s;pute, purpo&s;ely provoked by the Governor. That the con&s;tant Subject of their Complaint, has been the having their Money taken from them without their Con&s;ent; the &s;ub&s;tituting a dependent Judge, bribed by being paid out of the Forfeitures, to determine in all Cau&s;es of Revenue, by the Rules of the Civil Law, and without a Jury; and the Violation of their Security in the due Admini&s;tration of Government and of Ju&s;tice, by rendering the Governor and Judges <HI>totally</HI> dependent on the Crown. That their Wi&s;h has been to return to the State in which they were before the pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e Laws and &s;ending the&s;e In&s;tructions, and not to become independent of Great Britain. This appears not only from their repeated and authentic Declarations, but from Go|gernor Hutchin&s;on's Letters.
<Q>The Enemies of Government (&s;o is he plea&s;ed to &s;tile the Council, the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, and the People) gave out, that their Friends in Parliament were increa&s;ing, and all Things would be &s;oon on the old Footing; in other Words, that all Acts impo&s;ing Duties would be repealed, the Commi&s;&s;ioners Board di&s;&s;olved, the Cu&s;toms put on their old Footing, and illicit Trade be carried on with little or no Hazard.</Q>
The Malignity of this Reflection upon the People, will plainly appear from the following Declaration of Governor Bernard, who&s;e Te&s;timony in their favour will hardly be que&s;tioned.
<Q>I do not pretend, &s;ays he, that this Province is <HI>entirely</HI> free from the Breach of tho&s;e Laws (of Trade), but only that &s;uch Breach, if di&s;|covered, is <HI>&s;urely puni&s;hed.</HI></Q>
What more can be &s;aid of the be&s;t Country upon Earth? Yet Governor Hutchin&s;on does not &s;cruple to charge them with having been all Smugglers, and throw an Odium upon their &s;truggling for their Rights by the

<P>It mu&s;t al&s;o appear from their Proceedings, that their great Crime has been their Con&s;tancy in petitioning for Redre&s;s of Grievances; which has been attempted to be repre&s;&s;ed, even by the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable Means of refu&s;ing them an Agent to vindicate them when mi&s;repre&s;ented, and &s;upport their Com|plaints. While this common Right of Ju&s;tice is denied them, Per&s;ons are notoriou&s;ly hired here to load them in the Public Papers with every Species of Opprobrium, Fal&s;hood, and Abu&s;e. There are two Things which de&s;erve the mo&s;t particular Attention: 1&s;t, That whenever Affidavits were taken on the Part of the People, they were taken in public, with Summon&s;es to all Per&s;ons concerned to attend, 2nd cro&s;s-examine the Witne&s;&s;es: On the contrary, tho&s;e which were obtained by the Governor and Commi&s;&s;ioners, accu&s;ing the People, were made in &s;ecret, the Per&s;ons accu&s;ed unapprized and totally ignorant of the Proceedings, they were tran&s;mitted in &s;ecret, and the injured Per&s;ons by mere Accidents, and after they had operated to their Hurt, had an Opportunity of &s;eeing and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">uting them. The In&s;tances on both Sides will be found in the Affidavits taken on the Seizure of the Sloop <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Riot,</HI> and in Mr. Oliver's Affidavit, and the Narrative of the Town, re&s;pecting the Ma&s;&s;acre on the 5th of March. 2d, That the chief and almo&s;t only continual Wit|ne&s;&s;es again&s;t the People are, the Governors Bernard and Hutchin&s;on: The former of whom has long laboured under an Accu&s;ation upon Oath of gro&s;s Corruption in his Office, the latter has been detected in the ba&s;e&s;t Plot again&s;t their Liberties; and both are at open Enmity with the People, having been petitioned again&s;t by their Repre&s;entatives, as univer&s;ally odious. How far the Repre&s;entations of Men &s;o circum&s;tanced can be pre&s;umed fair and impartial, or de&s;erve Credit, mu&s;t be left to the candid to determine.</P>
<P>We have &s;een their Petitions either intercepted, or treated with a contemptuous Silence, or an&s;wered with the &s;evere&s;t Cen&s;ures. Seven Years Supplication has brought no Relief. And now, to fill up the Mea&s;ure of their Misfortunes, their Port is &s;topt up, their Charter is to be &s;ubverted, and a lawle&s;s Army let loo&s;e upon them. They have been tried, condemned and puni&s;hed, unheard and unapprized of the whole Proceed|ings. They are left to weep over their Apprehen&s;ions, re|alized in the utter Subver&s;ion of their Liberties. This Ac|cumulation of Calamities is heaped upon them, becau&s;e high and &s;trong Re&s;entments, as they naturally mu&s;t, have followed

&s;evere and reiterated Injuries: Becau&s;e Di&s;content has ari&s;en from di&s;appointed and de&s;pi&s;ed Complaints; and Violence from in&s;ulted Di&s;content.</P>
<P>Whoever will take the Trouble of reading, in the Hi&s;tory of this mo&s;t meritorious and unhappy People, the unparalleled Hard&s;hips with which they purcha&s;ed tho&s;e Liberties we have now torn from them; and view the deplorable, the de&s;perate Situation, to which they are now reduced&mdash;however obdurate, however prejudiced he may be, he mu&s;t think, at lea&s;t, <Q>One human Tear may drop, and be forgiven.</Q></P>
