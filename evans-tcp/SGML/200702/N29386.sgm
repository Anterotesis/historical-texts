<P>WHEN the following pages were com|mitted to the pre&s;s, it was the wi&s;h and ex|pectation of the Author to remain in oblivion. A variety of cau&s;es have po&s;tponed its ap|pearance; and <HI>conjecture</HI> ever bu&s;y, and <HI>curi|o&s;ity</HI> ever prying, have lifted up the veil of con|cealment, and many are acquainted with the name and &s;ituation which &s;hrouded in an hap|py mediocrity, it was hoped would have e&s;cap|ed the ob&s;ervation of the world. Baffled in this her favorite wi&s;h, &s;he feels it a duty to apo|logize, with her very humble talents, for thus appearing in public. She very well know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, that writers of Romance are not highly e&s;ti|mated. She is likewi&s;e &s;en&s;ible that cu&s;tom and nature, which have affixed the duties of woman to very confined and very limited bounds, are by no means likely to patronize a female writer. She feels that her conduct

needs excu&s;e, and though the independence of her mind renders her unwilling to make one, yet nece&s;&s;ity obliges her to it. She is &s;o cer|tain that &s;o many will acknowledge the truth of her a&s;&s;ertion, that &s;he does not he&s;itate to declare, that not one &s;ocial, or one dome&s;tic duty, have ever been &s;acrificed or po&s;tponed by her pen; and though it may be objected that the time devoted to it, might have been better employed; She hopes that &s;he may be allowed in &s;ome re&s;pects, to be a judge of her own con|duct; her pen has always been a favorite im|plement, it has &s;oothed many <HI>melancholy,</HI> and &s;weetened many <HI>bitter</HI> hours. Her abilities are too &s;canty, to allow her to under&s;tand either religious or philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects in others, much more inadequate to the attempting them her&s;elf; incapable of undertaking the labours of hi&s;tory, or of attaining the &s;ublime heights of poetry; the only path which lay open, was that of Romance. The Revolution in France, and the perturbated &s;tate of Europe, have o|pened &s;ome &s;cenes, that would, without the&s;e amazing &s;hocks to the political world, have lain hid in ob&s;curity; to &s;ome of the&s;e &s;he has had recour&s;e, and many, very many &s;erious truths

<P>THERE are &s;o few people that read prefaces, that they are become quite un|fa&s;hionable; and many a volume is u&s;hered into the world, without what was once con|&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary appendage; I am however induced to deviate from the pre|vailing mode, and to pre&s;ent a few ob&s;erva|tions by way of preface.</P>
<P>I am apprehen&s;ive from the peru&s;al of the title page, that JULIA may, by &s;ome, be con&s;idered, a political work; as I have ev|er

hated female politicians, I think it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to declare it is not; intire|ly unacquainted with politics, I &s;hould have viewed a revolution of the greate&s;t part of Europe as it re&s;pected them, with uncon|cern and indifference, and though the feel|ing heart mu&s;t bleed at the recital of the mi&s;eries which are inflicted by pride, ava|rice, cruelty or mad ambition; though the tribute of many a tear, mu&s;t be paid to the &s;orrows of all mankind, from the unfortun|ate Louis, to the wretched We&s;t-India ne|gro, yet I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed them by, as evils, to which mankind will always be ex|po&s;ed. But when we &s;ee the greate&s;t part of the world, throwing off the &s;hackles of re|ligion, and becoming by profe&s;&s;ion, as well as by precept, infidels; it is impo&s;&s;ible not to con&s;ider it as a revolution from piety, and

from morality; and leaving politics intirely out of &s;ight, we &s;hudder at the pre&s;ent view, and &s;hrink from the di&s;tant pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that the &s;tory of JU|LIA, interwoven as it is with the Count DE LAUNA, would if portrayed by the pen of a Con&s;tantia, or decorated by the inchant|ing poetry of a Philenia, been adorned with a thou&s;and graces, that my &s;imple &s;tyle can never be&s;tow; but it is with &s;ome plea&s;ure I reflect, that if it cannot obtain the prai&s;e of the literati, it will not offend the mor|ali&s;t, and I have a prevailing hope, that its various errors will be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, when it is con&s;idered that the motive which induced its publication, was a wi&s;h to do good, or at lea&s;t to guard again&s;t evil.</P>

<P>JUST at the clo&s;e of one of tho&s;e delightful days, &s;o common in the &s;outh of France, the carriage of the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA de&s;cended into a charming valley, and the eye of the owner, which had for &s;everal hours been &s;uffu&s;ed with tears, was caught by the beauty of the &s;cene; her heart had been &s;o intirely occupied with &s;ome recent &s;orrow,&mdash;&s;o lacerated by affliction long &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed, that her imagination had wandered from the Coach, and had conducted her to the death bed of her beloved friend, or the &s;ide of an afflicted brother: indeed &s;he had &s;ome &s;or|rows of a nature &s;till nearer to her&s;elf: but with an expan|&s;ive heart and unu&s;ual benevolence of &s;oul, &s;he frequently forgot, or at lea&s;t buried her woes in the griefs of others:&mdash;At this time her mind was unu&s;ually agitated; and when &s;he caught a view of the &s;un now almo&s;t &s;etting; a pro&s;pect of the verdure with which the &s;urrounding hills were cov|ered, and a vi&s;ion of the lucid &s;tream which flowed around them, &s;he thought how often her &s;pirits had been calmed, and her mind harmonized, by a view of the beauties of na|ture: "Surely (&s;aid &s;he) they cannot wholly lo&s;e their effect; I will try and &s;teal if po&s;&s;ible a tran&s;ient tranquility from
<PB N="14" REF="039134_0010_1013AF80F97C7228">
objects &s;o &s;imple &s;o &s;ublime!" She alighted and bidding her attendants drive to the top of a neighbouring hill, &s;he walk|ed on; &s;ometimes &s;topping to &s;urvey the beauty of the &s;cene, and moralizing as &s;he went, &s;he thus found in &s;ome mea&s;ure that tranquility of which &s;he had been in pur&s;uit. Almo&s;t at the bottom of the hill, in a little turn of the road, &s;he found a neat Cottage; the perfect &s;implicity of which at|tracted her attention; a &s;eat was at the door, a door whol|ly over&s;hadowed with grapes and woodbine; the frag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nce of the one, and the coolne&s;s of the other, induced her to &s;et down;&mdash;but the voice of affliction which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the hou&s;e, no &s;ooner caught her car, than it reached her heart; and impatient to &s;ooth, even, if &s;he could not relieve, &s;he entered without ceremony, and was immediately &s;truck by the appearance of an old Man, who had ju&s;t expired. By the &s;ide of his bed &s;tood a young Girl, who&s;e face was &s;trongly agitated by agonizing &s;orrow, but it could not conceal her beauty; which even in that trying moment, was too uncommon to pa&s;s unob&s;erved a moment; her hands were cla&s;ped together, her eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon the inan|imate body, and her whole frame &s;eemed convul&s;ed by affliction.</P>
<P>The &s;imple garb in which &s;he was attired, was by no means calculated to adorn; but could not veil the ele|gance of her per&s;on; after a &s;econd's he&s;itation, Madam DU LAUNA, in a voice &s;oft and plaintive, and a language that could not be mi&s;under&s;tood, for it came from the heart and it went to the heart; thus addre&s;&s;ed the fair mourner. "I do not attempt to comfort you (&s;aid &s;he) that mu&s;t be the work of time, but heaven who pities your di&s;tre&s;&s;es, has &s;ent me, to &s;hare them with you; whatever may be your &s;orrows, when you are calmer you will confe&s;s them to me; and though I may not have the power to mitigate them, yet I will join my tears with yours, and by my &s;ympathy, aid you to bear them." There was in the manner, as well as the voice of the Counte&s;s, &s;omething &s;o fa&s;cinating, &s;o con&s;oling, and &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive, that the afflicted heart felt re|lief, and JULIA, &s;omewhat &s;oothed, &s;uffered her&s;elf to be &s;eated; her tears &s;till flowed, but they flowed in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>In a few moments, a young man with a woman and two pea&s;ants entered the room; the fir&s;t appeared to be a &s;er|vant of the decea&s;ed, and the two others, per&s;ons whom he had brought with him, to perform the la&s;t duties to the
<PB N="15" REF="039134_0011_1013AF827B6E6E88">
remains of his ma&s;ter; he now informed the Counte&s;s that JULIA, which was the young woman's name, was grand child of the decea&s;ed: "And now (cryed he piteou&s;ly) poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, has lo&s;t her only friend; for it is an hundred to one if her uncle even returns." This impertinent remark &s;eemed to wound the unfortunate creature anew, who was the &s;ubject of it; and though her lamentations were nei|ther l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad nor boi&s;terous, her heart &s;eemed to be breaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;orrows pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;orrows yet to come: The Coun|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> with a tenderne&s;s and delicacy not often met with, a|gain attempted to &s;oothe her; &s;he a &s;ured her, &s;he &s;hould never want a friend in her, and that &s;he &s;hould never feel a want which &s;he could prevent; u&s;ed to an elegant habita|tion, to a bed of down; and a &s;plendid apartment, with ev|ery conveniency and &s;uperfluity of life, &s;he determined to pa&s;s the night in the humble cottage, and in the morning of the following <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to prevail upon the friendle&s;s creature to accompany her to her own dwelling, and to &s;hare her fortune with her friends: In this view &s;he &s;ent &s;ome of her attendants to the Carriage for refre&s;hments from an Inn, and per&s;uaded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to retire to another &s;mall apartment, while the remains of her Grand Father were in&s;hrouded.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s DE LAUNA, &s;pent the whole night in ad|mini&s;tering comfort to her young Protege, and &s;o great a proficient was &s;he in all the duties of humanity, that the di&s;pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing girl became calm enough to li&s;ten to her gentle accents; to thank her for her goodne&s;s, and once more to think of life without tho&s;e excruciating &s;en&s;ations that aro&s;e in her bo&s;om when the Counte&s;s fir&s;t entered. "Have you always re&s;ided in this place my love (enquired this ex|cellent woman,) this que&s;tion was prompted by extreme cu|rio&s;ity which the perfect elegance of JULIA'S form had ex|cited; by the &s;oftne&s;s of her voice, by the propriety of her language and the gentlene&s;s of her manners; a politene&s;s that ari&s;e from an affectionate heart is not &s;ubdued, but aided by &s;orrow; that politene&s;s was obvious in this lovely girl; and the Counte&s;s mi&s;took it for that good breeding which is the re&s;ult of a life &s;pent in the world, and an acquaint|ance with what is generally termed good company.</P>
<P>"I have no recollection of any other habitation (&s;he re|plied;) my Mother was the only daughter of the worthy Man who is now no more: I have rea&s;on to think from many circum&s;tances, that my Father was of birth and fa|mily

&s;uperior; but my dear Mother always appeared un|willing to &s;peak of the&s;e things; and when I once pre&s;&s;ed her upon the &s;ubject, her reluctance was &s;o apparent that I could not prevail upon my&s;elf to wound her heart with any further enquiries: &s;he was very anxious re&s;pecting my education; &s;he taught me her&s;elf the u&s;e of the needle in its various branches, and from a neighboring town, pro|cured ma&s;ters to in&s;truct me in mu&s;ick, drawing and danc|ing; &s;he purcha&s;ed me books, attended to my &s;tudies, and treated me more like a &s;uperior than a child: The reflec|tions I have &s;ince made, did not then occur; nor did I till I was near &s;ixteen years old, think with any degree of &s;teadine&s;s upon the difference between the few girls I was allowed to conver&s;e with, and my&s;elf; this difference aro&s;e wholly from our different educations;&mdash;I then remarked it to my indulgent mother, and begged to know why &s;uch a di&s;tinction was made; my grand father (I &s;aid is poor,) you have always told me that we were &s;o too; why then expend &s;o much money to procure accompli&s;hments wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s; &s;ince they prevent my performing the duties of an indigent girl, with the alacrity that I ought too; &s;urely I had better learn &s;ome u&s;eful employment that will enable me to earn my bread. I &s;hall never forget her re|ply," you were not born my beloved child for the humble &s;tation you now fill; and I hope one day to pre&s;ent you to tho&s;e friends who will think them&s;elves honored by a connection with you: I &s;trive to make your Education &s;uch, as will render you an ornament to the &s;tation you will mo&s;t certainly be one day called to; the time will come, when I &s;hall rejoice to unfold every Enigma; at pre&s;ent re&s;t &s;atisfied, and be a&s;&s;ured I aim only at your happine&s;s.&mdash;But ala&s;s! where are her plea&s;ing progno&s;tics, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed forever from my view! pa&s;&s;ed like the clouds of the night or the vapor of the morning, and not one ray of the &s;un appears to illumine my dark and de&s;olate path!"&mdash;She pau&s;ed a moment, overwhelmed by the recollection: but the &s;oothing voice of the Counte&s;s rea&s;&s;ured and com|forted her, and &s;he continued. "There was &s;omething &s;o peculiar in my &s;ituation, that it could not fail to call forth a variety of &s;en&s;ations; I was ab&s;olutely forbid to &s;tray beyond the bounds of my grand-father's farm: I never &s;aw one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man except our &s;ervant; now and then I was vi&s;it|ed by the daughters of two neighboring cottages, but never

My mother made an annual vi&s;it at this &s;ea&s;on of the year to &s;ome friends &s;he had, but would never take me with her; &s;he always tarried all night, and never left home without giving me the &s;tricte&s;t injunction to remain with her father, and never leave the farm, if any thing prevented her re|turning, at the period &s;he appointed.</P>
<P>"Two years &s;ince &s;he was ab&s;ent but one day, and when &s;he came home, joy &s;eemed to animate her countenance, and &s;parkle in her eyes; her whole frame was agitated by hope: In a few days, my dear JULIA, &s;aid &s;he, embracing me, every my&s;tery will be cleared, and I &s;hall have the plea|&s;ure to &s;ee you acknowledged as what you really are; my pre&s;ent joys would be too great were it not for a &s;ad and dreadful tale that I have to unfold.

<P>Here &s;he ended her relation, and the Counte&s;s thanked her for her narrative, and told her that &s;he &s;hould return with her to the VILLA DE LAUNA. "I am rich, my dear, and of noble blood, (&s;aid &s;he,) but they only &s;erve to prove that riches cannot be&s;tow content, and nobility cannot confer happine&s;s: in the mid&s;t of wealth and magnificence, I have been mi&s;erable, and nothing but the hope of futurity, and a confidence that he who directs all things, cannot do wrong, could reconcile me one moment to life. I admire your &s;en|timents, approve your conduct, and am glad that your edu|cation has been &s;uch as to enlarge your mind and cultivate your ideas. In your &s;ociety I promi&s;e my&s;elf much plea&s;ure, and while I live, you &s;hall not want a friend: &s;ay nothing, my dear; I know all you would &s;ay; but to li&s;ten to the too greatful expre&s;&s;ions of a feeling heart, would betray a civili|ty that I hate, and receive a pain that is unnece&s;&s;ary."</P>
<P>JULIA now expre&s;&s;ed a fear that the leaving of the Cottage would be a breach of her mother's commands: but Madam DE LAUNA convinced her of the impropriety and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ibility of her tarrying there unprotected, till the re|turn of her uncle, who would mo&s;t probably con&s;ider her as an intruder, and treat her as &s;uch. "There is no doubt, &s;aid &s;he, a &s;ecret hangs over your birth; with me you will be &s;ecure; I am now going from Paris, where I have been to vi&s;it a brother who has returned from an exile of many years, and a dying friend.

<P>The next day the humble ob&s;equies of the old Man were performed, and the &s;weetly mournful countenance of JULIA attracted all the eyes of the ru&s;tic followers. The Counte&s;s walked by her &s;ide, and &s;upported and incouraged her; the genuine dignity and highly poli&s;hed affability of Madam DE LAUNA; the richne&s;s of her dre&s;s, the &s;imple and unador|ed beauty of JULIA; formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the

pea&s;ant groap around her, and the humility of the Prie&s;t, his bald and reverend forehead, with his religious garb and fervent piety; the rural &s;pot (but a few paces from the cot|tage) where Pierre was interred, formed a &s;cene really pic|ture&s;que. When they returned from the funeral, the carriage was ready, the Counte&s;s had before given orders to Simon. She now put a pur&s;e into the hand of the Prie&s;t, gave &s;ome money to the attending pea&s;ants, and leading JULIA from the hou&s;e, &s;eated her in the carriage, and the farm and the Cottage were out of &s;ight in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Madam DE LAUNA &s;aw her young friend &s;o wholly en|gro&s;&s;ed by a grief that &s;he knew to be entirely natural, that for &s;ometime &s;he forbore to offer any con&s;olation; deter|mined to let nature have its full play, and &s;en&s;ible that the unadulterated mind of JULIA, would, if let alone, &s;oon re|&s;ume its calmne&s;s.</P>
<P>The mind of JULIA had indeed nothing to cope with, but &s;orrow; &s;he knew too little of the world to be &s;u&s;picious, and her natural di&s;po&s;ition was too cheerful and to good to harbour any jealous thoughts. She had given her&s;elf up to the Counte&s;s without one fear, and in full confidence of her merit. In doing &s;o, &s;he did but ju&s;tice to her exalted virtues; but &s;he would have been full as likely to have tru&s;ted her&s;elf to the vicious and de&s;igning, who could have a&s;&s;umed the garb, and the appearance of active benevolence. But providence beheld the innocent girl unpracti&s;ed in the ways of deceit; unacquainted with vice or folly, and &s;ent this worthie&s;t of women as a friend to comfort and protect her.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF THE COUNTESS DE LAUNA.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA will continue to make a con&s;iderable figure in the following pages, it may perhaps be not unnece&s;&s;ary to give a few &s;ketches of her hi&s;tory, and tho' it is &s;o blended with that of her brother the Marquis of ALVADA, we &s;hall be pardoned by the candid, if &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances of his are intermixed with it.</P>
<P>The ancient family of ALVADA and DE LAUNA, had al|ready become connected, and it was the fervent wi&s;h of the Count and the Marquis, that the titles, honors and e&s;tate, &s;hould be &s;till more intimately blended; the re&s;pective ladies had been intimate friends from their birth, and with the enthu&s;ia&s;m natural to youth and innocence, they fell in with their hu&s;band's plans, and looked forward with delight to that period, when their grand children &s;hould be equally dear, becau&s;e equally attached to both. The Marquis AL|VADA was ble&s;t with a &s;on one year after his marriage; and the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA became a mother within two years; the children thus affianced in their cradles became fond of each other at an early age, and when the Counte&s;s pre&s;ented her hu&s;band with a &s;on in le&s;s than three years after the birth of her daughter, they only regretted that the Marchione&s;s was not favoured with a daughter: this wi&s;hed for event did not take place, till young DE LAUNA was twelve years old. But this di&s;parity of age did not prevent the&s;e friendly and affectionate parents from indulging their favorite wi&s;h; and the Count determined at all events to pre&s;erve the heart of his &s;on, till CAMILLA, the daughter of the Marquis, was old enough to receive him: with this

view it was determined to &s;end him abroad, as &s;oon as the nuptials of his &s;i&s;ter with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ALVADA took place; that event was only delayed, till the young lady arrived at the age of fifteen. This marriage was preformed before all the dependents and va&s;&s;als of both families; and many of the nobility and gentry were invited to be pre&s;ent at a ceremo|ny that more &s;trongly united two noble families. As &s;oon as the rejoicings that followed the wedding were over, young DE LAUNA was &s;ent abroad with a worthy tutor, who had &s;trict injunctions to prevent all intercour&s;e with the other &s;ex; to improve his mind and manners, and make him acquainted with every branch of knowledge u&s;eful, nece&s;&s;ary or ornamental. But the joys of all connected were dreadfully damped by the death of the young bride, which followed the birth of a &s;on; in a few days thus event ha&s;ten|ed that of the young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mother, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> did not &s;urvive his beloved wife a year. At his death he left his e&s;tate to his infant grand&s;on; his wife's fortune, with his title, and a large landed property, de&s;cended of his &s;on, then only &s;e|venteen, who in his la&s;t will he left to the care of the Mar|quis, and enjoined that as &s;oon as his daughter became of age to marry, that &s;he &s;hould be given to the Count. The young widower, after pa&s;&s;ing a few years near Paris, at the ancient family &s;ent, concluded to &s;pend &s;ome time abroad; he had loved his wife, for &s;he was beautiful and amiable; but the early impre&s;&s;ions &s;he had made, and left, were in &s;ome mea&s;ure worn out, before he quitted France; and gay company added to the variety of &s;cene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to which he was now introduced, intirely re&s;tored to him his former cheerful|ne&s;s. CAMILLA had in the mean time grown in every beauty and accompli&s;hment, and when only thirteen, was thought a lovely ornament to a brilliant Court. Ju&s;t at that period HENRY the olde&s;t &s;on of the Earl of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">MOND, on his travels through France, was recommended to the Marquis, and became for two years, re&s;ident in his Hotel.

A lady, who had all the en|chanting &s;implicity of rural innocence, blended with all the grace and elegance of a court education, and trained beneath the eye of an aunt who was acknowledged the be&s;t and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed woman in Italy. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing that LA|VINIA was all &s;he appeared; the pride and the delight of all that knew her. Surrounded by admirers of her own coun|try, &s;he gave a decided preference to ALVADA; nor did her friends wonder at this preference, for his per&s;on was indeed graceful; his manners refined; his morals unimpeached; and his abilities &s;uperior; with all the virtues engraven up|on his heart; he had received all the advantages of an ex|cellent education; he was at that time more than thirty years old, and in becoming acquainted with LAVINIA, he &s;oon experienced that tender, fervent attachment, that every heart of &s;en&s;ibility will at &s;ometime or other in their lives feel: he left her with vows of love and unerring truth, and ar|rived in France ju&s;t time enough to receive the parting breath of his father: determined to obey his dying command, he &s;oon &s;ettled every thing to the &s;atisfaction of his mother, and &s;i&s;ters, and in one year he returned to Italy, when LA|VINIA con&s;ented to receive his vows at the &s;acred Altar; in a few months before that time had elap&s;ed, poor CAMIL|LA. who &s;eemed to be pointed out for wounds from all &s;ides, received a letter informing her of the death of her &s;on; this lo&s;s was an aggravation to her former troubles; but &s;till &s;he was &s;upported, and behaved with a fortitude that did her hon|or, and when the Count DE LAUNA, returned after an ab&s;ence of &s;ixteen years, con&s;ented to give him her hand in compli|ance with the promi&s;e &s;he had made her dying father; but previous to this &s;tep, &s;he informed the Count of her prior attachment, and of its con&s;equence, the Count was one of tho&s;e rare characters in whom a &s;en&s;e of honor &s;uper&s;edes almo&s;t every other; the beauty of CAMILLA had engaged his attention; her virtues, and he felt the full force of a fir&s;t love: But notwith&s;tanding that, he would have left her free from pre&s;ua&s;ion, if ORMOND had lived: he ad|mired her frankne&s;s, and loved her the more for her candor; even the tears &s;he &s;hed for his rival, endeared her to his heart, and leading her to the Altar, he thought he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed

one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, and one of the brighte&s;t orna|ments that had ever adorned the marriage &s;tate. Upon his &s;ide it was productive of the pure&s;t delights; on her's it was calm and not unplea&s;ing; in giving him her hand, &s;he had obeyed a dying father, and a mother who loved her &s;uperior to every earthly ble&s;&s;ing: That mother &s;he lo&s;t the fourth year after &s;he became Counte&s;s DE LAUNA, her hu&s;band's increa&s;ed a&s;&s;iduity and affection in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded in making her forget her lo&s;s; and eight years pa&s;&s;ed on happily: In that time the Marquis had brought home his beautiful and amiable wife: but at home he found tho&s;e troubles he had &s;hunned abroad; his &s;on now near twenty was profligate and wicked, he had art enough to hide both from his father, but not to conceal the chagrin he felt from his &s;econd marriage, which he &s;uppo&s;ed would produce children to &s;hare his fathers e&s;tate, if not wholly po&s;&s;e&s;s his affection; thus influenced by inter|e&s;t and avarice, he refu&s;ed to &s;ee his mother-in-law; and two years elap&s;ed without an interview: his grand father had made him independent and he re&s;ided upon his own e&s;tate; the Marquis often heard of his exce&s;&s;es and grieved at debaucheries he could not prevent. The mild and gen|tle &s;pirit of the Marchione&s;s was affected by his malice and folly; but no unkind or repining word e&s;caped her lips, and &s;he &s;trove to render her hu&s;band and connections happy, by a con&s;tant per&s;everance in every virtue; but illne&s;s &s;eemed to effect what filial affection and duty had in vain &s;trove to perform. The Baron, (for his grand father had procured him a title) was &s;eized with a violent fit of illne&s;s, which his phy&s;icians pronounced to be mortal on the fourth day; compunction then &s;eized him, and notwith&s;tanding he was but newly initiated into the my&s;tery of the &s;ect that had given them&s;elves the title of ILLUMINATA, his con&s;cience told him it was no &s;hield again&s;t the hand of death; it was then he &s;ent to beg his father and mother-in-law, to vi&s;it him and receive his la&s;t &s;igh; the Marquis and his lady obeyed the &s;ummons; an entire reconciliation took place, and &s;uch was the effect that he recovered from his fever, but was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a decline. As the human heart is never &s;ofter than when newly reconciled to an object al|ways beloved, and for &s;ome rea&s;on neglected, &s;o the Mar|quis &s;eemed more attached than ever to his &s;on; in the fear of his death he forgot all his errors; in the hope of his recov|ery he hoped he was cheri&s;hing recovered virtues.</P>

The man&s;ion of the Baron was convenient, &s;uperb and plea&s;ant; it was not &s;o large as his father's Hotel, nor &s;o public, but it was retired, and the Marchione&s;s readily con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ted to her hu&s;band's wi&s;h to continue there, till &s;he &s;hould be recovered from a confinement that was &s;oon expected to take place.

Two days before his arrival &s;he had expired, in con&s;equence of a premature labor: he de&s;ired to &s;ee the corps, and though he examined it with a critical eye, he found nothing that could ju&s;tify his &s;u&s;picions, that &s;he came to her death by any unfair means&mdash;this &s;u&s;picion was founded on a thorough knowledge of the Baron's cha|racter; and &s;ome acquaintance, with a &s;et of vain Philo|&s;ophers he was connected with: but his apparent grief, the affirmation of the Phy&s;ician that attended, and the wo|man that was with her, convinced him he was mi&s;ta|ken: her funeral was performed with great magnificence, but the Marquis' grief knew no bounds. He at fir&s;t appear|ed like a man di&s;tracted, and for one year he continued in Spain, deprived of rea&s;on, and this was followed by a &s;e|vere melancholy. The death of her lovely &s;i&s;ter was a &s;evere affliction to the Counte&s;s, they had thought and felt alike, and a &s;imilarity of &s;entiment had created and nur&s;ed the mo&s;t perfect and &s;incere friend&s;hip.

At fir&s;t &s;he thought it a delu&s;ion, a vi&s;ion of fancy, &s;he gazed with a&s;toni&s;hment; &s;he doubted the evi|dence of her &s;en&s;es; &s;he had believed him dead from the authority of his own brother. How then could this be? &s;he now &s;aw him advancing toward her with a pale face indeed, hollow eyes; his eyes had lo&s;t all their &s;weetne&s;s of expre&s;|&s;ion, and the ro&s;es of youth &s;eemed bla&s;ted upon his cheek by an untimely fro&s;t; but they &s;till retained their fire, and fiercene&s;s, and &s;orrow &s;eemed to have taken the place of complacency and good humour: pride and haughtine&s;s had le&s;&s;ened the reign of mildne&s;s and dignified humility. She made not the&s;e remarks; &s;he fainted, and her hu&s;band with wonder and afflection, carried her from the pre&s;ence.&mdash;ORMOND, with an exclamation of &s;urpri&s;e, followed: it was &s;ome time after her recovery that the a&s;toni&s;hed Count could conceive the meaning of the &s;cene to which he had been a witne&s;s. At length the behaviour of ORMOND, left him no room to doubt that he was his early rival in her affections, and &s;till living to di&s;pute his right. He loved his wife, he loved his honor, and a long train of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cir|cum&s;tances ru&s;hed upon his view. It is not our de&s;ign to enlarge upon the &s;cene, nor could the feeble pen do it ju&s;|tice. From &s;ome things that came to light after; and that a gentleman connected with the family related, it was learn|ed that the noble family of ORMOND could not brook the idea that the principal hope of their race &s;hould be allied to a catholic; the marriage was illegal, performed without wit|ne&s;&s;es; the party under age; and no con&s;ent from connec|tions. ORMOND was deceived into a belief that CAMILLA was dead; and the Prie&s;t who performed the nuptials, aided the deceit: thus both un&s;u&s;picious them&s;elves, were both deceived. ORMOND, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years in Ame|rica, and was recalled but fifteen months previous to this event, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his title and e&s;tate, as his father was dead, and he was now cho&s;en by the Court of Great|Britain, to congratulate the king of France upon his nup|tials; the moment he &s;aw the Counte&s;s he knew her, and with one retro&s;pective glance, he &s;aw into the deception&mdash;but his temper was changed, he was no longer the amiable youth that CAMILLA had loved, and had &s;he &s;een him as he now appeared, DE LAUNA, had never known a rival; for his temper was revengeful, haughty &amp; overbearing, and unmind|ful

of her peace and quiet: The next day he &s;ent a challenge, couched in &s;uch terms of defiance, that it was impo&s;&s;ible not to accept of it; they met, fought, and DE LAUNA fell, covered with his own blood, and &s;inking beneath a mortal wound; but ORMOND, e&s;caped to En|gland.</P>
<P>The terror, the grief of the Counte&s;s, is only to be con|ceived by the feeling mind, and not to be de&s;cribed. In a few weeks, with an heart broken by &s;orrow, and a frame, &s;hattered by illne&s;s, &s;he followed the remains of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the VILLA DE LAUNA, nor had &s;he left it till within one month of the Commencement of this tale.&mdash;It is very nece&s;&s;ary to add that the Duke of ORMOND had claimed her as his wife, and pre&s;&s;ed his &s;uit with all the ardour of pa&s;&s;ion. But &s;he had &s;teadily refu&s;ed every pro|po&s;al of this kind. Second marriages, &s;he di&s;liked from principle; but to wed the man who&s;e hands were &s;tained with her hu&s;band's blood; was an idea too dreadful to be dwelt upon, and her heart &s;ickened at the thought. ORMOND was lately dead, and though it is probable &s;he felt &s;ome pangs at this event; certain it is that &s;he had been more calm &s;ince, than at any period of her widow|hood: Tried in the &s;chool of affliction: tutored by the rough hand of &s;orrow; &s;he now lived only for others; to ble&s;s a numerous train of dependents; to comfort the afflicted, to bind up the broken hearted, to pour the oil and wine of kindne&s;s and &s;ympathy into the bo&s;om of the oppre&s;&s;ed, was her bu&s;ine&s;s, and her plea&s;ure: and her ample fortune, gave her &s;ufficient power. She had never left the retirement that was endeared by her &s;ufferings, and by her happine&s;s, till called by the de&s;ire of a dying friend, and the &s;ickne&s;s of her brother, who had returned to France not le&s;s wretched, though more calm; and who&s;e afflictions were by no means le&s;&s;ened by the conduct of his &s;on: now the Count DE LAUNA, &s;on to the BARON; this title de&s;cending to him, upon the death of his uncle.

<P>FOR &s;everal hours after they left the Cot|tage, &s;ilence was ob&s;erved by the Counte&s;s, and JULIA, continued ab&s;orbed in unplea&s;ing reflections. But ju&s;t as the Sun was &s;etting they entered a little village; a &s;ight &s;o novel attracted the eye of JULIA, and &s;he could not forbear an exclamation of &s;urprize and wonder; to her the little town &s;eemed the capital of the world, and the humble church near its centre; a building of immea&s;urable magnitude. The Counte&s;s enjoyed her a&s;toni&s;hment, and rather increa&s;ed the &s;enti|ment &s;o natural to the inexperienced, and to the innocent mind: &s;he did not tell her that Paris was an hundred times larger, or that the Chateau DE LAUNA, was more magnificent than the little convent, at which &s;he meant to tarry for the night.</P>
<P>She had been always acquainted with the AB|BESS, and loved and re&s;pected her per&s;on and her character, and had often &s;aid if &s;he &s;hould ever retire to a convent, which &s;he had once con|templated, it would be this: is not to be

doubted but &s;he met with a hearty and friendly welcome, and both Nuns and &s;uperiors vied with each other to entertain the pen&s;ive and wondering JULIA, whom the Counte&s;s recom|mended to their care, for the night; refre&s;hment and repo&s;e were highly nece&s;&s;ary, and extremely welcome to the wearied frame of the unfortunate girl; but for &s;ome time her agitated mind for|bade its approach; wearied nature at length found it near midnight; and when JULIA awoke at &s;unri&s;e, the next morning, &s;he found her mind calm, and her per&s;on reanimated with health, hope and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>She met the Counte&s;s in the parlor, and after the u&s;ual &s;alutations of the morning, they accept|ed the invitation of the ABBESS, to join their early ve&s;pers, which were performed to the admiration of JULIA. One of the &s;i&s;ters &s;howed her every apartment in the Nunnery; and in &s;o doing oblig|ed and a&s;toni&s;hed her, and filled her mind with &s;en&s;ations &s;o intirely new, as almo&s;t to exclude her recent &s;orrows, and furni&s;hed her with a fund of nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful reflections for the day: at nine they bid adieu to the&s;e ho&s;pitable reclu&s;es, and began a journey that was much more plea&s;ing than the preceding day.</P>
<P>The eye of JULIA, which for years had been bounded by one narrow farm, was never &s;ati&s;fied with gazing upon the va&s;t horizon; the amazing tract of land, variegated by hills, meadows, woods and waters, attracted her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tention; and though the pro&s;pects in &s;ome parts were neither grand nor romantic, though the hand of indu&s;try had neither turned the globe, nor cultivated the &s;oil for miles around; yet to her it was an inexhau&s;tible &s;cene
<PB N="31" REF="039134_0027_1013AFAD64627400">
of delight and a&s;toni&s;hment. As &s;he made her natural and lively remarks, the Counte&s;s li&s;tened with plea&s;ure, and &s;aw with wonder the power of nature over an heart unu&s;ed to the world. The minute&s;t beauties did not pa&s;s unnoticed, and what would have e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of a com|monly cultivated mind, was to her a &s;ource of moralizing and enjoyment. You are extremely like a lovely woman, &s;aid Madam DE LAUNA, who now &s;leeps in the cold embrace of death; the &s;ame beauty, the &s;ame bewitching &s;implicity, the &s;ame native good &s;en&s;e, and reflecting pow|ers, and to the&s;e &s;he added all the elegance of a Court, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every virtue and every grace in an eminent degree; the likene&s;s &s;truck me la&s;t evening, and this morning too, I could not but remark it. Nineteen years ago, (&s;he added with a &s;igh,) I vi&s;ited this convent with her, my brother and hu&s;band; we were all happy; compa|ratively, I was &s;o; for though I had bid adieu to tho&s;e flattering hopes of romantic felicity, that once flowed in my di&s;turbed imagination, yet, I was calm and contented, I enjoyed all the ble&s;&s;ings of friend&s;hip, and one of the be&s;t of hu&s;band's. The friend that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my warme&s;t e&s;teem, and that hu&s;band are long &s;ince &s;ecreted in the gloomy man&s;ions of the grave; taken away by means the mo&s;t &s;hocking; &s;acrificed to the ba&s;e&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions. Forgive me my love; I pain you when I &s;hould a&s;&s;uage the angui&s;h of your heart, by a &s;ad retro|&s;pection of my &s;orrows.&mdash;But I was going to re|mark, that you reminded me of that lady, and not with&s;tanding the difference of your lives and edu|cations you think and &s;peak &s;o much alike, that I almo&s;t fancied I &s;aw her again; beheld once

more her fair frame, reanimated by life and re&s;tor|ed in all its former loveline&s;s. When you re|marked the re&s;ignation of the pen&s;ive Abbe&s;s, the palene&s;s of the Nuns, the &s;ighs of the Novice, and the gloom of the Cloi&s;ter, I heard her voice in your's and found your &s;entiments &s;o exactly what her's was, that I went back near twenty years and looked around for my hu&s;band and brother: but ala&s;s! you are all that remains of joy to me: The fleeting vi&s;ion of the original and the wor|thie&s;t of men are no more; and my brother, by the cruel events of his life, is rendered u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ociety and burthen&s;ome to him&s;elf. JULIA, with all the warmth of an affectionate heart, pre&s;|&s;ed the hand of her benefactre&s;s to her lips, and en|deavoured to cheer the &s;pirits which were &s;o low|ered by reflections, by a&s;king que&s;tions that intro|duced a conver&s;ation that la&s;ted till they came within &s;ight of the VILLA DE LAUNA, and an involuntary exclamation of plea&s;ure and &s;urpri&s;e bur&s;t from her lips.</P>
<P>The elegance, ta&s;te, fancy and art that were here di&s;played; rural beauty mingled with gran|deur and magnificence, elevated the mind, while they charmed the eye: every nece&s;&s;ary and real convenience were con&s;picuous, and at the &s;ame time rendered &s;o ornamental, that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for a per&s;on who had &s;een the world and been mo&s;t acquainted with the grand, and the noble, not to admire it. The connoi&s;&s;eur and the critic &s;ought in vain for faults, and vainly wi&s;hed to find &s;omething to blame, that they might di&s;play their own talents: but they returned di&s;appoint|ed, though not chagrined, for the ho&s;pitality and benevolence of the Counte&s;s, overpaid them for

being obliged to commend, when they meant to condemn.</P>
<P>What then mu&s;t be the &s;en&s;ations of a girl of eighteen, who recollected no hou&s;e, but a Cottage of two rooms, and who&s;e ideas of the &s;uperb, were formed from books, and the conver&s;ation of an old Man, of &s;lender abilities, who knew but little; and a woman, who&s;e mind was always too much agitated by misfortunes, to pretend to give infor|mation on architecture. She could not expre&s;s her &s;urpri&s;e; &s;he found no words to tell her ad|miration, and &s;he was lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment: The Counte&s;s &s;o charmed with &s;implicity, and ingen|uous expre&s;&s;ions, almo&s;t forgot every thing that related to her&s;elf; but her va&s;&s;als and dependents, by the te&s;timonies they gave of joy at her return, convinced her that neither ab&s;ence nor misfortunes could efface from the grateful mind a &s;en&s;e of be|nefits received, when conferred in &s;uch a manner as to convince the obliged they were conferring favors; &s;he could not receive &s;uch proofs of their grateful affection without tears; they a&s;&s;embled around the carriage with their humble pa&s;tor at their head to inquire for her health, and ble&s;s her for her return, while her &s;miles and affability were di&s;pen&s;ing ble&s;&s;ings and comforts around her. Oh, my dear Madam, &s;aid JULIA, how rejoiced I am to find the world &s;o good and &s;o amiable, I had &s;uppo&s;ed that there were &s;ome wicked &amp; mi&s;|erable among&s;t them, but all tho&s;e people look &s;o good and &s;o happy, that I am &s;ure I have been deceived. How ble&s;t mu&s;t you be in the power to render them &s;o happy and &s;o good, and &s;o glad to &s;ee you too: I had no idea that the world was &s;o amiable. The world, my love, &s;aid the

Counte&s;s, you &s;ee but little of the world; but yet added &s;he, the&s;e humble and happy ru&s;tics, are an epitome of thee.</P>
<P>They now alighted, and after inquiries for the welfare of all, Madam DE LAUNA ordered whole|&s;ome food and liquors for them, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, with an invitation to dance upon the green that day fortnight. It was near night when they arrived, and &s;oon after a &s;light repa&s;t, JULIA was conducted to her apartment, they con&s;i&s;ted of a bed chamber, dre&s;&s;ing room and clo&s;et, tho&s;e my dear (&s;aid her benefactre&s;s) are yours, they have been fitted up for &s;ome time, and I have been in pur&s;uit of an inhabitant for them, and am rejoiced that I have found &s;o plea&s;ing an owner. The books, furniture, and mu&s;ical in&s;truments are your own. Tomorrow I will furni&s;h a wardrobe for you, and here added &s;he, taking a &s;miling lit|tle girl that ju&s;t then entered, is your attendant, ANNETT, you are henceforth to obey this young lady, and &s;ee that you do nothing to di&s;plea&s;e her. Do not, my dear good lady, &s;aid JULIA, thus oppre&s;s me with benefits, I want no attendant, &s;uf|fer me to attend upon you, it will be much more becoming. Not one word, my dear, as you value my e&s;teem, you are my friend, my companion, and as &s;uch my equal, and not a &s;ervant. But let me do &s;omething, &s;aid the be&s;eeching girl:&mdash;Let me u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dre&s;s you every night, let me read you to &s;leep; let me hall you every morning at your ri&s;ing; attend you at your toilet, and by all the little trifling little offices in my power, in part repay, or at lea&s;t, expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of your goodne&s;s, and my gratitude. Ah JULIA, cried the Coun|te&s;s, you are too in&s;inuating to be denied, and if

<P>The next day JULIA attended the Counte&s;s in &s;everal vi&s;its of charity, and beheld the effu&s;ions of benevolence and gratitude with &s;o much plea|&s;ure, and a plea&s;ure &s;o new, that &s;he began to think her very being was changed, and that her heart was filled with &s;en&s;ations to which &s;he mu&s;t have ever been a &s;tranger: but for her excellent friend; the native conde&s;cen&s;ion of her heart, that humili|ty of &s;oul, which the amiable delight to cheri&s;h and encourage, taught her to be affable to all around her, while the innate dignity of con&s;cious rectitude and con&s;cious honor, forbade every thing like &s;er|vility or meanne&s;s. She &s;oon grew beloved by the &s;ervants and every day rendered her more dear to the Counte&s;s. She was never tired of ramb|ling over the plea&s;ure grounds, of &s;etting under groves of Orange, Lemon or Citron, or attending to the feathered &s;ong&s;ters, that every hour &s;erenad|ed them, nor had the lombardy Poplar, the lofty beach, the graceful Elm, and the venerable Che&s;|nut, le&s;s beauties, becau&s;e intermixed with le&s;s plenteous exotics; they were all &s;urveyed with en|thu&s;ia&s;m and delight, and &s;he literally "looked through nature. up to nature's God."</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s had real plea&s;ure in informing her mind, and felt a &s;incere &s;atisfaction in making her acquainted with every thing that could either plea&s;e or impro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> her, and the mere &s;he knew of her native, good &s;en&s;e, the happy temperament of her mind and di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he became more at|tached.

There is nothing that more endears an amiable dependent to a truly generous heart, than a knowledge of that very dependence, and a &s;en&s;e that it is in the power of the benefactor to render the obliged intirely happy: &s;uch were the Coun|te&s;s, and JULIA, and a &s;en&s;e of obligations on one &s;ide, and a wi&s;h to oblige, joined to good hu|mour, frankne&s;s and good abilities, all concurred to cement the affection which they naturally felt for each other; thus grateful and affectionate, JULIA pa&s;&s;ed four weeks tranquil and happy, the pea&s;ants had their ball, and &s;he was delighted that &s;he had learned to dance; but till now had never been a partaker of the plea&s;ing exerci&s;e and now at the de&s;ire of her patrone&s;s, &s;he danced and found the mu&s;ic &s;o animating and &s;o agreeable that &s;he enjoyed it highly.

<Q>SURE Gratitude is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, as well as the &s;tronge&s;t emotion of the human heart;&mdash;and he who does not feel its force, is wretched.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ABOUT three weeks after, the Counte&s;s was informed, that a &s;tranger wi&s;hed to &s;peak with her; &s;he ordered him to be admitted, and was &s;urpri&s;ed, to &s;ee a Man near forty years old, who was an entire &s;tranger to her. What are your commands, friend? &s;he a&s;ked. The man replied, he had waited upon her by her own direction, upon account of a letter, which he then held in his hand, and which he &s;aid he had received three weeks &s;ince. The Counte&s;s immediately recollected the letter &s;he had written from the Cottage, to JULIA's uncle. Are you the &s;on of <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> PIERRE? (&s;aid &s;he.) I am, Madam, he replied. 'Tis my uncle exclaimed JULIA, in a tone of plea&s;ure; and &s;he aro&s;e and advanced towards him; he &s;tepped a little back and repli|ed, no, young lady, I have not that honor. How! cried the Counte&s;s, did not you &s;ay your name was PIERRE, the &s;on of the old man, who died at AVIGNON. I am his &s;on, Madam, but &s;till I have not the honor to be related to that young Lady; 'tis upon that account that I have come here, otherways I &s;hould not have been &s;o bold, and given you this trouble.

lady was the grand-daughter of your Father; her relation&s;hip would reflect honor upon any one; why then do you deny her as a neice? &s;he wants nothing of you. Excu&s;e me, Madam, &s;aid the man, and you Mademoi&s;elle, pray, be|lieve me, I &s;hould think my&s;elf highly honored by being your uncle, for I am a poor man. a &s;er|vant; and you a fine young lady; but I &s;hould act a di&s;hone&s;t part were I to &s;ay I am your uncle. Who are you then, interrogated the Counte&s;s, &amp; who is &s;he? if &s;he has been deceived, act a gene|rous part, and undeceive her. She now &s;aw JULIA almo&s;t &s;inking under her various emo|tions; Emotions too &s;trong not to be impre&s;&s;ed upon her face. Do not give way to the&s;e agita|tions my dear, cried the kind, the feeling woman, I will always be your friend, and you &s;hall never know the want of a relation. I know your good|ne&s;s, and I feel it, Madam, but do forgive this weakne&s;s; to find my&s;elf denied by the only per|&s;on that I could claim as a relation. She would have proceeded, but tears &s;topped her utterance. The Counte&s;s again demanded of PIERRE, who &s;he was? He &s;topped a few minutes, as recollecting him&s;elf, at length he &s;aid, my father was a poor, a very poor man, he never had any child, but my|&s;elf; my mother died when I was but three days old; my father was never married again: when I was twelve years old he put me out as a lackey, to attend upon the Chevalier St. ENNO: and he him&s;elf was entertained as a &s;ervant to the young Baron DE LAUNA. I went with my ma&s;ter to CLEAVES, and never &s;aw my Father until I was twenty years old; he then came to vi&s;it me, and
<PB N="39" REF="039134_0035_1013AFC48BEFE880">
told me he had quitted the BARON's &s;ervice, and was obliged to change his name; he &s;aid he had the care of a woman, and a little girl, who owned a farm at AVIGNON, and that he &s;hould in future live upon it; but as he did not under|&s;tand the cultivating of it him&s;elf, he &s;hould keep a &s;ervant. When I a&s;ked him who this woman was, he &s;aid &s;he went by the name of VALLACE, but that was not her real name, and &s;he was o|bliged to take great care to conceal her&s;elf and child, as its life would be in danger if di&s;covered; my Father told me that he depended upon my &s;ecrecy, and charged me in my letter never to mention it to any one but our&s;elves. I have liv|ed &s;ixteen years at CLEAVES, with a <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">NVILLE, and have written my Father regular|ly once a year; his an&s;wer always told me he was well, and that he wanted for nothing; this made me quite ea&s;y; but when I heard by SI|MON of his &s;udden death, and from your lady|&s;hip's letter found I was &s;uppo&s;ed to be heir to what he left, I thought it was my duty to inform you of the truth; as to this young lady, &s;he is the right owner of the little land my father cul|tivated, and the hou&s;e he lived in, and I wi&s;h it was as much again, for your &s;ake Mademoi&s;elle; for SIMON tells me that you were very kind to my Father, and if it is in my power ever to &s;erve you, I &s;hall be glad and ready.</P>
<P>Both JULIA and the Counte&s;s continued &s;ome time in a &s;tate of a&s;toni&s;hed &s;ilence; at length the former thanked him for his good wi&s;hes, and a&s;ked how &s;he &s;hould proceed. I am plea&s;ed with your hone&s;ty, my friend, you &s;hall not lo&s;e

by if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at what you told me, I never &s;uppo&s;ed JULIA what &s;he appeared; I will take it upon me to &s;ay, the Farm and the Cottage are yours, with all that belong to it; I only beg you will be &s;ilent concerning this af|fair; if you can leave your &s;ervice, I &s;hould ad|vi&s;e you to re&s;ide at the late habitation of your father; I am per&s;uaded you can make a com|fortable &s;upport from the land that &s;urrounds it, and if we &s;hould want your evidence, we &s;hall know where to apply. JULIA confirmed the promi&s;e of her benefactre&s;s, and as &s;oon as PIERRZ left them, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new abode, and was from that moment a faithful adherent to the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he left the room, Madam DE LAUNA embraced her young friend with expre&s;&s;ions of the tendere&s;t &s;atisfaction; I am afraid, my dear, (&s;aid &s;he) that I am &s;o little minded as to feel what is called family pride; I am almo&s;t a&s;ham|ed to confe&s;s that I already love you better than when I &s;uppo&s;ed you were de&s;cended from old PIERRE. Do not mi&s;take me, in imagining that I can &s;uppo&s;e any grade of life, however lowly, excludes the virtues, nor that there is any, but is at &s;ome times graced with all that's good and amiable; but I cannot help thinking the&s;e in|&s;tances very rare; this I do not impute &s;o much to any original defect, as to the effects of a narrow and confined education; the &s;ociety to which they are habituated; and the narrow &s;phere in which they move. I thought from my fir&s;t &s;eeing you, that you could not be in any &s;hape related to the man of the Cottage, and I have
<PB N="41" REF="039134_0037_1013AFC8BA5048A0">
no doubt you are de&s;cended from, or connected with &s;ome of our chief Nobility; I doubt it ve|ry much, (cried JULIA,) but I am not enough acquainted with the world to di&s;pute the ju&s;tice of your remark; though I own my dear Madam that there is a <HI>forlornne&s;s</HI> in the idea of not be|ing the acknowledged relation of one per&s;on in the world; of not knowing one per&s;on in who&s;e veins one drop of my blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lows; that is &s;o painful, that I would gladly barter it, for what I &s;hould feel to know my&s;elf nearly related to one of your hone&s;t tenants. Conceive your&s;elf relat|ed to me, then (&s;aid the Counte&s;s,) call me by the endearing appellation of Mother, con&s;ider me as &s;uch, and no one will prove a tenderer one. Oh! my Child, if my &s;on had lived, I &s;hould in|deed be a mother, but providence has denied me &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing. I &s;hould be ungrateful to pro|vidence, replied JULIA, if I did not acknowledge the va&s;t, the mighty ble&s;&s;ing I received; forgive then my revered, my beloved benefactre&s;s, this mo|mentary la&s;pe of gratitude, you are indeed more than a mother to me. Such was the tide of &s;en|timent that &s;o tenderly ru&s;hed upon her, that to have re&s;tored the child of the Counte&s;s, &s;he felt &s;he would have given up her own life, and &s;uch was the &s;imilarity of emotions that &s;welled in both bo&s;oms, that the Counte&s;s conceived without explanation the full force of her virtue and gratitude.</P>
<P>To di&s;&s;ipate the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, &s;he propo&s;ed an airing, and after a plea&s;ing ride of &s;everal hours, in which their eyes had been regaled by the mo&s;t delightful views, and their &s;pirits refre&s;hed and
<PB N="42" REF="039134_0038_1013AFCA42946298">
enlivened by the cool air and fragrant breeze; when upon their return, &s;he ordered her &s;ervants to drive back of the little road, and cro&s;s the river where it was fordable. She here pointed out &s;ome pro&s;pects that JULIA had never &s;een, and &s;uch a univer&s;al harmony &s;eemed to pervade all nature, that every painful idea was &s;ucceeded by calmne&s;s &amp; tranquillity. But this tranquillity was interrupted by the hor&s;es taking fright at the fall of a tree upon the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and in &s;pite of the driver's endeavours turned down the &s;tream, and were in a moment beyond their depth; and the carriage in&s;tantly overturned. JULIA was uppermo&s;t, and the &s;ervant who retained his pre|&s;ence of mind, bur&s;t open the door of the coach, and with difficulty dragged her out and drew her to the &s;hore. Quite exhau&s;ted with his burden, and heavy with his wet and cumberous clothes, he could do no more, and the Counte&s;s mu&s;t have inevitably peri&s;hed; but the &s;udden appear|ance of a young man rai&s;ed a hope in his mind: for God's &s;ake (he cried in a convul&s;ive agony,) <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> &s;ave my Lady, &s;he is drowning in yon|der carriage. The impetuous &s;tranger waited not, but plunging into the water, he was in a moment&punc; by its &s;ide. The hor&s;es were by this time cleared from their tackling, and had di&s;ap|peared with the driver; the coach was full of water, and the Counte&s;s &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the bottom; the intrepid youth entered, and with great difficulty forced her from it, and in a few minutes brought her to the &s;hore; but not one &s;ymptom of life or animation, flattered them with remaining life. By this time &s;everal &s;tout
<PB N="43" REF="039134_0039_1013AFCE2E8D2510">
woodmen were collected, and the Ladies by the direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the young &s;tranger, were conveyed to a &s;mall cottage clo&s;e by the edge of the wood. The extreme ignorance of the people was &s;uch, that they now thought they had done every thing that could be done, and but for the per&s;evering care of her deliverer, his former exertions had been thrown away; the &s;urgeon had been &s;ent for from the Villa, but before his arrival, the aid that was then nece&s;&s;ary, would be no longer needful; he ordered two countrywomen that were in the woodman's cot, to undre&s;s and put both the ladies into a warm, but very coar&s;e bed, and with vola|tiles, that were found in the pockets of the Coun|te&s;s, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted to rub their temples and hands; in a few moments JULIA recovered, but when &s;he &s;aw her friend and protectre&s;s, apparently dead, her agony became extreme, and &s;he relap&s;|ed into a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. The young gen|tleman with active and humane zeal, di&s;tributed his care and attention alike to each; It was more than half an hour before the Counte&s;s gave the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of returning life; and then it was &s;o very weak and faint, that one le&s;s animated than her pre&s;erver, would have given up the at|tempt as hopele&s;s, and improbable. But his ex|ertions were continued till &s;he opened her eyes, and attempted to a&s;k where &s;he was. At that moment the &s;urgeon arrived, he immediately opened a vein, and gave her a cordial, which &s;he &s;wallowed with &s;ome difficulty, and JULIA who had now recovered a &s;econd time, had the inex|pre&s;&s;ible joy to hear him &s;ay &s;he would be quite
<PB N="44" REF="039134_0040_1013AFD22D5E8C38">
well in an hour; in this, however, his &s;anguine hopes outran his judgment, for though &s;he recov|ered her voice and recollection, &s;he was &s;till weak and dangerou&s;ly ill. JULIA, my love, &s;aid &s;he, where are we? and what place is this, that we are got to? I thought we were in the water; I am &s;ick and dizzy; I believe I have had a dreadful dream. The emotions of JULIA were &s;uch as de|prived her of the power of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;he could only cla&s;p her arms around her and weep; joy, &s;or|row, gratitude, fear and hope, alternately a&s;&s;erted their power, and &s;uch a variety of &s;en&s;ations, &s;truggled at once for vent, that her rea&s;on was almo&s;t overpowered. To calm the tumults of her mind, and to &s;atisfy the Counte&s;s, the &s;urgeon gave her an account of her danger and e&s;cape, and begged her to be compo&s;ed. An opiate which he admini&s;tered, had the effect he wi&s;hed, and after a few hours repo&s;e, the Counte&s;s de|clared it her intention to return to the VILLA, and begged her deliverer would accompany her. The young man he&s;itated for a few moments; he felt it would look as though he wi&s;hed for thanks, and perhaps reward, for an act of human|ity, that he would have performed with equal avidity, for the beggar or the king, for his friend and his enemy; and his heart which was warm and generous, revolted at the idea; but that heart was &s;u&s;ceptible to the charms of beauty and in|nocence, and he felt him&s;elf drawn by a power that he did not comprehend, for till now he had never given a decided preference, to any one of the &s;ex; nor did he under&s;tand the nature of a charm &s;o &s;weet at to be irre&s;i&s;table, in the pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="45" REF="039134_0041_1013AFD3CFC47408">
invitation he received. A coach and attendants were &s;ent from the Villa, and Madam DE LAUNA felt a &s;incere joy to hear that her &s;ervant had been &s;aved, though both of the hor&s;es were drowned. She now rewarded every per&s;on who had been &s;o active in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her; and at nine in the even|ing arrived at Villa. Her &s;ervants had been told &s;he was dead, and mo&s;t of them, with many of her va&s;&s;als had come with agonizing hearts to the wood, and nothing but the ab&s;olute injunc|tions of the &s;urgeon, and his declaration that her perfect recovery, depended upon the calmne&s;s of her mind, could moderate their joy, at finding her alive. But tho&s;e that had not left the hou&s;e, when they &s;aw her, became quite frantic, and made the air re&s;ound with their acclamations of plea&s;ure, and their conduct upon this occa&s;ion was the mo&s;t convincing proof of her goodne&s;s and their affection. They got around her deliv|erer, and were &s;o clamorous in their demon&s;tra|tions of gratitude, that one le&s;s intere&s;ted or le&s;s amiable, would have turned with di&s;gu&s;t from them. But the innate benevolence of FRANCIS COLWORT, his love of merit, the noble frankne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, were &s;uch, that he enjoyed tho&s;e tran&s;ports that gave him an high idea of the worth of the Counte&s;s, and of her young companion. JULIA, who was intirely recovered, refu&s;ed to leave the apartment of her friend for the night; but it was with great reluctance that her con&s;ent was granted.</P>
<P>Mr. COLWORT, was conducted to the be&s;t apartment, by the hou&s;ekeeper, who wi&s;hed him every ble&s;&s;ing, and left him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="46" REF="039134_0042_1013AFD694B014E0">
be&s;t and greate&s;t; an heart plea&s;ed with having performed an act of humanity, and a con&s;cience void of offence.</P>
<P>The next morning the Counte&s;s was not well enough to breakfa&s;t in the parlour, but &s;he &s;ent to reque&s;t her gue&s;t would take his morning re|pa&s;t in her dre&s;&s;ing room. Both &s;he and JULIA were prepared to e&s;teem a man who had rendered them &s;o e&s;&s;ential a &s;ervice. For JULIA, her heart was &s;o grateful, and &s;he viewed the benefit &s;he had received as of &s;o va&s;t a magnitude, that had he been old, ugly and deformed, her glowing imagination would have painted him young, lovely and amia|ble. But the aid of imagination was intirely un|nece&s;&s;ary to add one charm, or one grace, to the manly form and intelligent countenance of FRANCIS COLWORT. In that countenance, an|imated by good &s;en&s;e and benevolence; &s;he be|held the index of one of the be&s;t of minds, and a counterpart of her own, where virtue and gen|uine dignity of &s;oul, pre&s;ided; and a high &s;en&s;e of honor &s;parkled in his eyes; courage tempered by di&s;cretion; good humour, untinctured by meanne&s;s or &s;ervility, and a frankne&s;s that did not even border upon in&s;olence or ill manners; and when he entered the apartment, with a &s;tep firm, and a manner maje&s;tic; with a graceful, mode&s;t and ea&s;y dignity; it is not at all &s;urpriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing if &s;he viewed him with &s;en&s;ations of admira|tion, almo&s;t amounting to reverence; and when the Counte&s;s attempted to thank him for the &s;er|vice he had rendered her, he &s;poke of it in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hew he did not hold the act in any e&s;timation; but was rejoiced that the life he had
<PB N="47" REF="039134_0043_1013AFD94276C878">
been &s;o fortunate as to &s;ave was &s;o valuable; as he a&s;&s;ured her, he &s;hould have taken the &s;ame care of the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant of his fellow crea|tures; and her heart, which was pained by the &s;en&s;e &s;he had of the obligation &s;he was under, became quite calm and ea&s;y; and after a few minutes the conver&s;ation turned upon general to|pics, and the forenoon was pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ocial, familiar manner, that is &s;o endearing to old friends, and minds of &s;imilar &s;entiments; mutu|ally plea&s;ed with each other at the fir&s;t &s;ight: &s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ure of obliging, and being obliged. A few hours made them acquainted with the worth of each other, and they were in that time mutually charmed. With frankne&s;s and without he&s;itation, in an&s;wer to the Counte&s;s inquiries, he informed her that he had come to France, upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s for an uncle, who had been the guide of his youth; as he had at a very early period lo&s;t his parents, that he had performed the affairs that called him from <HI>London,</HI> and now meant to &s;pend a few weeks in rambling over the country, previous to his return, and that he &s;oon intended to make a voyage to America. My uncle wi&s;hes me to go into trade, [&s;aid he,] becau&s;e he has accumulated a large property by traffic, and I wi&s;h to vi&s;it a great people who&s;e &s;truggles for liberty, have emancipated &s;everal millions from tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion; who have laws without an arbitrary government, and liberty without anarchy and confu&s;ion. I confe&s;s the character I have heard of them has excited an ardour rather uncommon in me, to be acquaint with them; and as I mean to e&s;tabli&s;h a com|mercial
<PB N="48" REF="039134_0044_1013AFDBEC3371E8">
corre&s;pondence, my plans will not inter|fere with my uncle's, and I flatter my&s;elf we &s;hall both be gratified. But does not the length of the voyage affright you (&s;aid the Counte&s;s,) by no means Madam, he replied. In what time can it be performed, (a&s;ked JULIA,) he informed he that it did not u&s;ually exceed five weeks, but ad|ver&s;e winds, he added, &s;ometimes rendered it four times as long. What an amazing while, (&s;ighed JULIA,) to be to&s;&s;ed upon the bo&s;om of the deep; and yet I think a view of the boundle&s;s Ocean uninterrupted by any other object, mu&s;t be &s;ublime. I think &s;o too, cried the youth, and own I wi&s;h to behold it; and yet its &s;amene&s;s mu&s;t tire a vacant mind, or a mind that is al|ways in pur&s;uit of novelty. But a mind, young man, (replied the Counte&s;s,) that always carries about a fund of knowledge, and u&s;eful entertain|ment, will never be tired of viewing the grand and the &s;ublime works of nature. It &s;urpri&s;es me, &s;aid COLWORT, that &s;o many of its real beau|ties pa&s;s unnoticed, except by few; we &s;ee every day the ri&s;ing and &s;etting &s;un, but how is this grand object unnoticed, except by few, and the heart alive to enthu&s;ia&s;m and delight, can never &s;ee them without renewed rapture and delight, and the &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t be unutterable, when in all its maje&s;ty it is beheld withdrawing its &s;plen|dor from this our horizon, and retiring to ble&s;s and enlighten other regions. I can never (&s;aid JULIA,) behold its ari&s;ing without a plea&s;ure that I have no words to expre&s;s. It reminds me of &s;ome truly noble and worthy heart, who &s;ets out in the morning determined to fulfill all the
<PB N="49" REF="039134_0045_1013AFDEA4342488">
duties of the day, to ble&s;s and make all they meet happy. The &s;ame &s;imile holds good at its &s;etting, (rejoined COLWORT,) for it retires, like the excellent per&s;on you mention, &s;ati&s;fied with having done right, and in all the maje&s;ty and pride of virtue: But ladies, I fear I intrude; I &s;hall carry away &s;ome of the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t refined impre&s;&s;ions, and if I could hope to be re|membered by you, it would &s;horten and &s;weeten my voyage. You are not going (&s;aid the Coun|te&s;s?) indeed I &s;hall not permit it. I &s;hall tarry in France but one fortnight, Madam. Tarry here then; you have &s;een the Capital, and from hence you may ramble around the country; we will either walk, or ride with you. I have in|tended to take a little tour, for &s;ome time, for the &s;ake of my young friend: with you added to our party, we &s;hall receive much more in|&s;truction, and plea&s;ure too. If I con&s;ult only my own heart, Madam, I &s;hall gratefully accept your invitation; for I am &s;ure I mu&s;t be happier here, than el&s;ewhere; but I fear I &s;hall intrude upon your goodne&s;s. Leave that to me, replied the Counte&s;s, JULIA knows my heart, and &s;he &s;hall tell you when you intrude.</P>

<Q>"Love creeps in unawares, and &s;teals us from our&s;elves."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the afternoon JULIA played upon her harp&s;icord and accompanied it with a voice &s;oft, &s;weet and harmonious: COLWORT found a flute; he joined the little concert, and the judicious &s;e|lections of &s;ongs added &s;entiment to the charms of melody. After &s;ome time &s;pent in this ra|tional and plea&s;ing amu&s;ement, they left their in&s;truments, and COLWORT a&s;ked the Counte&s;s if &s;he was extravagantly fond of mu&s;ic. I can|not &s;ay that I am, &s;he replied; I love a little of it; a good &s;ong and a &s;weet voice, plea&s;es me; when I u&s;ed to dance, I admired the violin; the &s;ound was enlivening; with church mu&s;ic, I am delighted; it is a part of the &s;ervice that ought never to be omitted, or abridged: it excites de|votion, it elevates the heart, and it &s;oftens tho&s;e religioni&s;ts that are either too au&s;tere, or too ri|gid, and I own I am always an enraptured li&s;ten|er. How comes it about, Madam, cried COL|WORT, that performers of mu&s;ic, or tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s that art are &s;o often addicted to vices? is it not becau&s;e it &s;oftens the heart, and debili|tates the natural fortitude of the mind, and leaves it expo&s;ed to plea&s;ures that enervate the noble&s;t faculties of the &s;oul? Your remark is new (&s;he replied) and I believe ju&s;t, for I have ob&s;erv|ed
<PB N="51" REF="039134_0047_1013AFE55F97F3A0">
the votaries of &s;en&s;uality, are generally attach|ed to it; I have never thought with your SHAKESPEARE, that the "man who hath not mu&s;ic in his heart, is fit for trea&s;ons, robberies and murders:" It is an illiberal remark: I have found many per&s;ons who had neither ear nor ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, and yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every virtue: When &s;entiment is expre&s;&s;ed by an harmonious voice, and an amiable countenance which has breathed harmony of &s;oul and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition; I am a warm admirer of it, but am a&s;hamed when I hear people talk of dying, of fainting, merely at the magic of &s;weet &s;ounds and I am al|mo&s;t per&s;uaded that the charms of a rational and refined conver&s;ation will be preferred by all who are capable of joining in it.</P>
<P>The next week was &s;pent in excur&s;ions around the country, and as the Counte&s;s was not per|fectly well, JULIA, at the de&s;ire of her friend ac|companied COLWORT either in the carriage, on hor&s;e back, or in his walking rambles, and every moment pa&s;&s;ed together, &s;erved to endear them to each other, by di&s;covering a &s;imilarity of &s;enti|ment, ta&s;te, and di&s;po&s;ition; they almo&s;t forgot the hours of retirement before they parted at night; and they aro&s;e early in the morning to meet with renewed plea&s;ure, to communicate &s;ome remark, or &s;ome idea, that had occurred &s;ince they parted, or which had been before for|gotten.</P>
<P>One week flew by, on wings of down; ano|ther had pa&s;&s;ed imperceptibly, and a third was nearly elap&s;ed; the Counte&s;s beheld a growing attachment, and &s;he beheld it with plea&s;ure and
<PB N="52" REF="039134_0048_1013AFE6E7706B98">
approbation; &s;he marked its progre&s;s with &s;ati&s;|faction, and re&s;olved to render it happy. She ob&s;erved one day a cloud upon the face of COL|WORT, and a&s;ked the cau&s;e; I have been in a dream of bli&s;s, for I had almo&s;t forgotten the &s;or|rows of one who is entitled to my love, re&s;pect &amp; gratitude, (he replied,) but this moment reflec|tions has come to my aid, and reminded me of my duty. I &s;ee you are &s;urprized, and I am &s;ure you will forgive me, if I explain the cau&s;e of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> only regret, that I can know in your company. My uncle has only one child, a lovely daughter, who was till within two years, the principal pride and plea&s;ure of his life; but &s;he formed a con|nection that has bla&s;ted all his hopes in her. She married a man totally unworthy of her, and went with him to America: &s;he is now in de&s;ti|tute circum&s;tances, de&s;erted by her hu&s;band, and &s;uffering all the &s;tings of poverty in a foreign country. It is to bring home the unfortunate ELEANOR, to re&s;tore her to parental love, and protection; that is my principal inducement to go to America. It was the thought of her woes and of her father's &s;orrows, that embittered one moment &s;pent here. Before he had fini&s;hed, or they had time to comment upon this informa|tion, a &s;ervant entered with a letter from his un|cle: he opened and read it without one apology, and found it was time to leave the enchant|ments of the Villa, and return to the affairs of the world; but he could not help betraying &s;ome emotion, his countenance became more &s;oftened. Both the ladies a&s;ked if he had received any bad news; yes, indeed, &s;aid he, I have, though I
<PB N="53" REF="039134_0049_1013AFE86C08E748">
ought not to think it &s;o; but I am &s;ummoned directly to London, the &s;hip in which I embark for America, &s;ails in ten days, and tomorrow I mu&s;t attend the calls of duty and leave tho&s;e I love be&s;t upon earth. If that is the ca&s;e, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, why then do you leave us? why take this hated voyage? you are &s;en&s;ible of the a|mazing debt I owe you; and if I know any thing of the human heart, you will be happier here than el&s;ewhere; &s;uffer me then to fix you here for life, or if you prefer England, there is no need of going to America, to e&s;tabli&s;h your for|tune. I con&s;ider you as my children, and as &s;uch I &s;hall &s;peak to you; I know you do not wi&s;h to impo&s;e upon each other, or deceive me: I am perhaps better acquainted with the progre&s;s that a tender affection has made in your hearts than you are your&s;elves: It is innocent, my ami|able friends, and you need not be a&s;hamed of it; I have been an intere&s;ted ob&s;erver, from the mo|ment you fir&s;t met, till now; I am drawn towards you both, by cords that I do not perfectly under|&s;tand; but let the &s;entiment be derived from what &s;ource it will, I own I love you both, better than I do any other object, and I would &s;eign render you happy: I will leave you for a few moment, and then return to hear upon what you have de|cided; only remember this, that an ample for|tune waits your acceptance; and that whatever place you fix upon, for your abode, I will be either an inmate, or a neighbor.</P>

COLWORT emboldened by this o|pening, waited but a few moments, till the tu|multuous confu&s;ion of his heart had in &s;ome mea|&s;ure &s;ub&s;ided, before he made an avowal of an attachment as &s;incere and tender, as it was im|pa&s;&s;ioned, JULIA li&s;tened almo&s;t &s;inking with blu&s;hes, and fluttering with a rapture till then unknown; his words vibrated upon her ear; they conveyed to her heart the &s;ofte&s;t, &s;weete&s;t plea|&s;ure; and though overpowered by the impre&s;&s;ion, yet &s;he would not have exchanged the &s;en&s;ation for any other &s;he had ever known; unacquaint|ed with the world, coquetry and prudery were equally &s;trangers to her unadulterated mind, and &s;he had attained that happy medium which is the re&s;ult of pure nature, and with a frankne&s;s and mode&s;ty untinctured by art or affectation; &s;he acknowledged a preference to his virtues and his per&s;on, of which &s;he had till then been a &s;tranger, and which &s;he believed would continue as long as her life; but &s;hrinking from conceal|ment, &s;he told him the little &s;tory of her former days, and owned her&s;elf unacknowledged by a|ny relation, friend, or protector except the Coun|te&s;s, to who&s;e humanity, &s;he was indebted for all the advantages &s;he enjoyed; while COLWORT admired the native honor of her un&s;ullied mind, he loved her the better for her misfortune and frankne&s;s, and her narrative had rai&s;ed Madam DE LAUNA, to a pinnacle of excellence in his e&s;ti|mation, that no one had ever attained to before.</P>
<P>Their conver&s;ation was broken off by the en|trance of the lady, that now occupied almo&s;t an equal &s;hare of their e&s;teem; but in attempting

to expre&s;s his thanks, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to do ju&s;tice to his feelings; he then confe&s;&s;ed that his voyage to America was inevitable; that gra|titude and affection to his uncle, required it; and declared he thought he &s;hould never be happy, though equally ble&s;t by love, friend&s;hip and affluence, until he had re&s;tored his unhappy cou&s;in, to the arms of her parents; he promi&s;ed however that &s;ix months at farthe&s;t &s;hould return him to the Villa, and then it JULIA would re|ceive his hand, he would &s;ettle in any part of England or of France, that was agreeable to JULIA and her benefactre&s;s; that his own for|tune, though limited, was not dependant upon another, and he &s;hould chu&s;e to depend upon his own exertions, for increa&s;ing it, rather than upon the bounty of any one.

<P>It would be only a repetition of what has al|ready been repeated a thou&s;and times, to go in to a detail of what pa&s;&s;ed between JULIA, and her lover. He took his leave of her the next day, after promi&s;ing to write long and circum|&s;tantial letters, and with an heart filled with love, gratitude, admiration and regret, left the VILLA DE LAUNA, for Calais, at which place he meant to take a packet for Dover.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s and JULIA, felt a vacancy in their hearts, after his departure, that was painful, nor was the void filled up by finding his place at the table de&s;erted; &s;o forcibly were their minds impre&s;&s;ed at his ab&s;ence, his intended voyage, and the dangers which imagination pre&s;ented as his attendants, that whether, walking or riding, he was the continued &s;ubject of conver&s;ation; a topic which never tired them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he arrived in London, he wrote them, and though his letters were of nece&s;&s;ity &s;hort, they very forcibly expre&s;&s;ed the &s;en&s;ations of his heart. Before they received the&s;e letters,

<Q>BEAUTY, hath &s;uperior force, when attendant upon the chamber of &s;ickne&s;s; and the angel never looks &s;o fair, as when &s;oftening the calamities to which mortality are incident.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NOTHING happened for &s;everal weeks worth relating; but one morning when JULIA went into the chamber of the Counte&s;s, &s;he found her &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, that her affectionate heart took an immediate alarm. Madam ap|peared calm and compo&s;ed, and though &s;he would not acknowledge her&s;elf &s;o ill as &s;he ap|peared, yet &s;he told JULIA, that &s;he was appre|hen&s;ive of a &s;ever, and informed her that a num|ber of years before, &s;he had been attacked in the &s;ame manner, and that though her life was then &s;pared, the phy&s;icians had declared &s;he could never &s;urvive &s;o cruel a di&s;temper in future. I have a pre&s;age (&s;aid &s;he) that I &s;hall not recover;&mdash;I wi&s;h to perform &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, and to &s;end for an advocate from the next town: I have neglected this duty to along, and fear my rea&s;on will not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to perform it now.</P>
<P>The grief of the affectionate JULIA, cannot be de&s;cribed, but it did not for one moment pre|vent her fulfilling every duty of friend&s;hip. When the phy&s;ician arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> looks were cloud|ed by anxiety, his an&s;wers doubtful, and he even urged the Counte&s;s to fini&s;h her worldly bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="60" REF="039134_0056_1013AFFE0BFFFDB0">
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. This was only to make a will, in which &s;he bequeathed JULIA, fifty thou|&s;and crowns, and the like &s;um to COLWORT: the re&s;idue of her noble fortune, excepting lega|cies which were large and liberal, to her &s;ervants, would devolve upon her brother, the Marquis ALVADA, and his &s;on the Count DE LAUNA.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervants knew that their mi&s;tre&s;s was making a will, they filled the hou&s;e with their lamentations, and every apartment echoed with their affliction; as for JULIA, her's were &s;ilent, and tho' her grief was not of the boi&s;terous kind, her &s;orrows were deep and afflictive. She attend|ed the bed&s;ide of her friend every moment, and pre&s;ented every medicine to her lips, her &s;oft hands fixed the pillow that &s;upported her throb|bing head, and wiped the damp drops from her forehead &amp; temples, her arm was always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and when &s;he fixed and placed the bed and clothes, a kind of tran&s;ient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e &s;eemed to follow.</P>
<P>The Marquis &amp; Count were &s;ent for, but before this was done, the Counte&s;s lo&s;t her rea&s;on, &amp; &s;uf|fered all the pangs that the <HI>delirium</HI> of a fever could inflict, the phy&s;icians were detained at the Villa, &amp; for &s;ome days a conflict was maintained between a good con&s;titution and a dreadful di&s;order, and which would get the victory was doubtful; upon the ninth day after &s;hifting her po&s;ition a thou|&s;and times, &s;he &s;unk into a deep &s;leep, in which &s;he continued for &s;ix hours, the phy&s;ician &s;at up|on one &s;ide of the bed and JULIA upon the oth|er, watching that breath that they expected every moment to leave the worn-out frame of their
<PB N="61" REF="039134_0057_1013AFFF8E329908">
expiring friend, and now and then wetting her parched lips with a liquid that the nur&s;e had prepared. The doctor declared that if &s;he ever awaked, &s;he would be in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered, or el&s;e in the la&s;t agony of expiring nature. The la&s;t hour of this &s;leep appeared the longe&s;t of JU|LIA'S life; &s;he counted the &s;econds as they moved upon her watch, and li&s;tened for the clock to &s;trike twelve, with an impatience that &s;he had never known, as if the hour of midnight was to decide her fate, for it was the opinion of all, that the Counte&s;s would not &s;urvive that time.</P>
<P>But the clock had &s;truck twelve; and it was near one, when awakening with a deep &s;igh, &s;he &s;tretched out her feeble hand, and a&s;ked for &s;omething in &s;uch a manner, as declared &s;he had regained her perfect recollection. JULIA had kept her &s;orrow within due bounds, but &s;he could not &s;o ea&s;ily conquer or control her tran&s;ports. She threw her&s;elf upon her knees; ki&s;&s;ed the hand which &s;he held in hers, and in a delirium of joy, &s;he thanked heaven for this recovery; declared her &s;elf the happie&s;t creature in the world, and em|braced the doctor with a thou&s;and expre&s;&s;ions of frantic extacy. The &s;en&s;ible &s;on of GALEN, found it nece&s;&s;ary to curb her feelings. For the pre&s;ent, he per&s;uaded her to be more &s;ilent, and calm, which he a&s;&s;ured her were highly nece&s;&s;ary, as the Counte&s;s mu&s;t &s;till be kept very quiet.</P>
<P>She obeyed him, but though &s;he ob&s;erved al|mo&s;t a death like &s;ilence, &s;he could not &s;ubdue her joy; &s;he &s;eemed to move on air; every care was lighter than down, and &s;he could with diffi|culty refrain from embracing every one who ap|proached her.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="039134_0058_1013B0029104B080">
This night was a cri&s;is that declared the Coun|te&s;s a candidate for lengthened life: in the morn|ing &s;he was much better, and though her recovery was &s;low, it was attended with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pre&s;ages.</P>
<P>The very day after her di&s;order had a&s;&s;umed a favorable a&s;pect, the Marquis and his &s;on arriv|ed; though the utmo&s;t caution was u&s;ed in in|forming her they were come, yet &s;he was obliged to take &s;ometime to prepare her mind for an inter|view, and &s;ent out the doctor to receive them. In le&s;s than half an hour &s;he became &s;o compo&s;ed, that they were introduced; &s;he held out her hand to her brother, &s;aid &s;he was rejoiced to &s;ee him and thanked him for this vi&s;it. The Mar|quis who loved her tenderly, embraced her with emotion, and the Count expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction to find her out of danger. After they were &s;eated, I cannot &s;upport a conver&s;ation my&s;elf (&s;aid &s;he very weakly) that ta&s;k mu&s;t devolve up|upon my friend, Madamoi&s;elle VALLAICE, who does me the honor to re&s;ide with me.&mdash;The Marquis now turned, and for the fir&s;t time beheld the elegant form and intere&s;ting face of JULIA; &s;imple and unadorned, habited in a white <HI>Robe de Chambre,</HI> her beautiful hair &s;tray|ing over her fine forehead, and her charming mild eyes fixed upon the languid face of the Coun|te&s;s, animated with hope, and expre&s;&s;ive of ex|treme &s;en&s;ibility; &s;he returned the &s;alutations of the Marquis with a graceful curt&s;y, and a gen|tle inclination of her head; &s;he offered him her chair that he might &s;et by his &s;i&s;ter, and the &s;oft accents of her voice which tremblingly expre&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="63" REF="039134_0059_1013B00558102FD0">
the feelings of her heart, vibrated upon the ear of the old LORD.</P>
<P>It was many years &s;ince he had experienced a|ny emotion at the &s;ight of youth and beauty, but the beauty of JULIA was of that nature to arre&s;t the eye, to reach the heart, and to engage e&s;teem and re&s;pect from every beholder. The Marquis felt his whole &s;oul drawn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">owards her, he gazed upon her for &s;ome moments, he looked with &s;ur|prize; and tried to define his feelings, he at|tempted in vain to addre&s;s her, he ob&s;erved her hair that fell in luxuriant abundance about a neck, who&s;e extreme whitene&s;s can never be emu|lated by art. She now aro&s;e to pre&s;ent the friends of her benefactre&s;s with a cordial; her motion ra|pid and ea&s;y, became again the &s;ubject of wonder. Where did you meet with this young lady, &s;i&s;ter? By an accident, the mo&s;t fortunate to me, (&s;he replied.) JULIA added, the accident was indeed an happy one for her. The &s;weetne&s;s of her voice again fixed his attention. Oh! CAMILLA, (&s;aid he) &s;uch was once the lovelie&s;t of women; &s;ay, did you never think &s;he re&s;embled&mdash;The Mar|chione&s;s (interrupted the Counte&s;s,) yes, brother from the moment I &s;aw her, the likene&s;s &s;truck me forcibly; but I &s;ee you are moved, I am &s;or|ry you have &s;een my JULIA; &s;he will ab&s;ent her|&s;elf, I am &s;ure, if the &s;ight of her, pains you.&mdash;Certainly (cryed JULIA.) I would not for worlds give a moment's pain; &s;he was going,&mdash;No, (&s;aid the Marquis detaining her) your ab|&s;ence would indeed di&s;tre&s;s me, I am an old Man, Mademoi&s;elle, and you may permit an old Man to look upon you; for indeed I find a plea&s;ure
<PB N="64" REF="039134_0060_1013B008011632C0">
in it, that I am not accu&s;tomed to; I am both old and unfortunate, &s;ay, will you indulge me with your &s;ociety, for there is a charm in it, that I thought was lo&s;t forever.</P>
<P>Oh (&s;aid JULIA with impa&s;&s;ioned fervor) if I can indeed give plea&s;ure to the beloved and re&s;pected brother of my benefactre&s;s, even a momentary plea&s;ure, I &s;hall indeed be happy; too happy, too much honored, and grow vain. Amiable crea|ture, (&s;aid the Marquis) where are your parents, tell me that I may congratulate them upon &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing. Alas! &s;he replied, I have none, and except your excellent &s;i&s;ter, not one friend in Europe. Then you &s;hall be my daughter, (he &s;aid) I never had one, and will be a father to you, &s;ay will you own me for a father?</P>
<P>Happy Oh mo&s;t happy &s;hall I be (replied the grateful girl, to call you by &s;o re&s;pected, &s;o endear|ing a name, and on my knees, I thank you for this conde&s;cen&s;ion. He embraced her with tears, and &s;he joined her tears with his; &s;he wondered at emotions &s;o new, and &s;o plea&s;ing, and when &s;he beheld his hair whitened by &s;orrow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> rather than years, the furrows which grief had impre&s;&s;ed up|on his face, &s;he felt &s;o much love, veneration, re&s;pect and &s;ympathy, as altogether formed a com|bination of &s;en&s;ations, which, till then, &s;he had been a &s;tranger to.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t part of this conver&s;ation, the Count had regarded JULIA with looks very different from his father's; his eyes had wander|ed over every charm, and confe&s;&s;ed its power; and he thought her an object worth his attention; but when the Marchione&s;s was mentioned, he had
<PB N="65" REF="039134_0061_1013B00ACB916148">
retired with &s;ome emotion to the window, till the Counte&s;s prayed her brother to introduce his &s;on to his adopted daughter; you are an old Batch|eldor, Nephew (&s;aid &s;he,) but you mu&s;t guard your heart, and think of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> only as a &s;i&s;ter, for my young friend has given aw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y all her more tender affections. With the air of a man of the world and gallantry, the Count a&s;&s;ured his aunt he thought her caution nece&s;&s;ary, and that he would endeavor to regard Madamoi&s;elle only in that light that would be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to her.</P>

<P>IN one week the Counte&s;s was &s;o well as to leave her chamber, and in le&s;s than two to ride out, and a&s;&s;ociate with her family as u&s;ual. Re|turning health brought with it cheerfulne&s;s, and all its plea&s;ing attendants. She was anxious to render the Villa agreeable to her brother and his &s;on; for, though &s;he dete&s;ted the character of the latter, &s;he wi&s;hed to try what effect &s;he could have upon his mind, when at a di&s;tance from his vicious a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>The Marquis grew every day fonder of JULIA, and &s;he looked up to him every moment with increa&s;ing reverence and affection. The more the Count became acquainted with JULIA, the more dangerous he found her; too lovely not to be admired; too con&s;tant to change, and too frank to di&s;&s;emble: But notwith&s;tanding his o|pinion he formed of her fidelity, his vanity repre|&s;ented him&s;elf as irre&s;i&s;tible, and he began to form hopes, and to think that a connection with her virtues, would re&s;tore him &s;ome of tho&s;e he had lo&s;t; and &s;ecure to him the good will and favor of the Counte&s;s, which he had penetration enough to know he was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; with
<PB N="67" REF="039134_0063_1013B01153B00A00">
this thought he &s;trove to render him&s;elf agreeable to her, and a&s;&s;umed a merit that he was a &s;tranger to; but while lavi&s;h in the prai&s;e of virtue, tho' loud in his declamation again&s;t vice; &s;he &s;aw through the veil; penetrated through the cloud he had wrapped him&s;elf in, and found he was an infidel. "For tho' his tongue dropped manna, and could make the wor&s;e appear the better rea&s;on," yet &s;he looked and found that all was fal&s;e and hollow; nor was he &s;uch a novice in the human heart, as not to read hers, he was indeed an adept in deception him&s;elf, and under&s;tood the charac|ter of mankind as well, if not better, than peo|ple in general; he &s;aw that JULIA de&s;pi&s;ed him, and he could not hide from him&s;elf that he de|&s;erved &s;he &s;hould.</P>
<P>He was indeed a very &s;ingular character, his mind was never formed for virtue, and early in life he di&s;covered traits of a de&s;igning, artful di&s;|po&s;ition; his father was very young, and at that time ab&s;ent; he was flattered and care&s;&s;ed by all who knew him; and at the age of fifteen, put under the care of one of the wor&s;t of men, who knew how to render the vices, and weakne&s;&s;es of others &s;ub&s;ervient, to his own intere&s;t. This man was a member, though a concealed one, of the <HI>Illuminati,</HI> and he &s;aw what an advantage would accrue to the &s;ociety, by adding to their number the principal of ALVADA and DE LAU|NA's family, who&s;e great e&s;tates would enrich them, and who&s;e power would &s;erve as a protec|tion; with this view he indulged all his pupil's vicious propen&s;ities; turned all religion into ridi|cule, and learned him to conceal his vices with
<PB N="68" REF="039134_0064_1013B012D5CBF0D8">
art and caution. The young man was an apt &s;cholar, and by the time he was twenty, had com|mitted &s;ome crimes that made even his tutor &s;hudder; he had indeed been &s;ucce&s;sful in con|cealment, but &s;ome little piccadilla as they were called by his party, had e&s;caped him, and &s;ealed his character with the &s;tamp of infamy, in the opin|ion of every per&s;on of worth and merit; nor could any pretentions to virtue ever re&s;tore it to any thing like purity. Dark in his de&s;igns; &s;udden in his re&s;olves; ob&s;tinately attached to his own opinions; vain of his under&s;tanding; and though in many re&s;pects ignorant; proud of his talents, and after all, though courageous in the pro&s;ecution of his de&s;igns, he had a latent weakne&s;s and imbecility of mind, or rather cow|ardice of thought; for, it could not be called con&s;cience, that &s;ometimes made his a&s;&s;ociates a|fraid to tru&s;t him, though they &s;cared to refu&s;e him their confidence, for he was envious and ma|licious. Thus, though hated and de&s;pi&s;ed, by them all, he was their ruler, held their lodges at one of his hou&s;es, and was now next in dignity to their Grand Ma&s;ter; he hated royalty, yet was &s;ometimes &s;o vain, as to a&s;pire at the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of a &s;ceptre; he laughed at religion, and he trembled at its power and wi&s;hed, to po&s;&s;e&s;s it; he turned virtue into ridicule, while he had known it exi&s;ted; and he adored honor, at the moment he &s;neered at its dictates; as a &s;lave to vice, he was unacquainted with rea&s;on, for its laws had never once controled one vicious thought, nor prevented one bad action. This was the Count DE LAUNA, a man who had not been one

fortnight at the Villa before he made &s;erious pro|po&s;als to the innocent and amiable JULIA.</P>
<P>Never was the power of virtue more fully proved over the vicious, than in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance; not that virtue embodied, could have made a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on a mind &s;o vitiated as the Count DE LAUNA; but it had a tran&s;ient effect, it arre&s;ted him in his career, it &s;topped the progre&s;s for the pre&s;ent, and it occa&s;ioned a lap&s;e in his illegal pur&s;uits. He was never tired of the company of JULIA, and though her whole con|duct was a cen&s;ure upon his own, and he &s;aw he was indebted for the little civility and re&s;pect &s;he granted him, to his father and aunt, though he feared &s;he hated him, yet he loved her as a being of &s;uperior merit. When he came into her pre|&s;ence, he lo&s;t that haughty triumph that was &s;o evident in his countenance and demeanior, and became humiliated to &s;uch a degree, that he de&s;|pi&s;ed him&s;elf for his &s;ervility which he found him|&s;elf unable to conquer.</P>
<P>The Marquis enjoyed in the quiet of the Villa, a &s;atisfaction, to which he had been long a &s;tran|ger; his health was benefitted; his mind was calm, and his rea&s;on, which had been much de|ranged, was perfectly re&s;tored; the Counte&s;s ob|&s;erved this change with plea&s;ure; &s;he loved her brother and did every thing in her power to pro|long a vi&s;it, that rendered her much the happier; his &s;on was in his opinion re&s;tored to virtue, and JULIA who&s;e whole attention was marked with a kind of reverential attention, performed for him a thou&s;and little offices, that more properly belonged to his dome&s;tics; when he entered the
<PB N="70" REF="039134_0066_1013B01706AD32B0">
room where &s;he was &s;etting, &s;he aro&s;e involunta|rily; if his &s;eat was inconvenient, or unplea&s;ant, &s;he was &s;ure to fix one more commodious; if he walked, &s;he attended him; if he &s;lept, as he &s;ometime did in his chair or &s;opha, &s;he played &s;ome &s;oft tunes upon the harp or piana; if he wi&s;hed it, &s;he read to him, and in &s;hort &s;he be|came &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his comfort, that he was un|ea&s;y without her; thus &s;he cheated him of his &s;orrows, and concealed her own; for &s;he was un|ea&s;y about COLWORT of whom &s;he had heard nothing &s;ince his embarkation for America.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed three months, and the Count had exerted every talent to prevail with JULIA to accept his hand and fortune, but all his per&s;ua|&s;ions proved that tho&s;e talents which had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful with other women, were nothing to her, and he had the extreme mortification to find, he had not advanced one &s;tep farther towards her favor, at the end of three months unwearied con&s;tancy, than when he began the attempt.</P>
<P>More company now appeared at the Villa, the&s;e were Madamoi&s;elle GYRON and DONNA OLIVIA a Spani&s;h lady; this la&s;t lady was di&s;|tantly related to the Counte&s;s, and had taken this opportunity to play off her hitherto &s;ucce&s;sful charms upon the Count. Mademoi&s;elle GY|RON, had always felt the warme&s;t e&s;teem and love for the Counte&s;s; &s;he was certainly a fine wo|man, and though an air of pen&s;ive &s;adne&s;s was evi|dent, and though &s;he wi&s;hed to conceal it, it was always ob&s;erved. She had heard with extreme &s;atisfaction of her late recovery, and &s;he took this opportunity to renew their old friend&s;hip, and congratulate her upon her returning health.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="039134_0067_1013B01B1A271D38">
The Chevalier ENON, a coxcomb and an Ital|ian Nobleman, who was a kin&s;man of the Mar|chione&s;s, attended the&s;e ladies, and they came prepared to render this party as plea&s;urable as po&s;&s;ible. DONNA OLIVIA, was a fini&s;hed Co|quette; &s;he had beauty, and &s;he added to it an haughtine&s;s that was in&s;ufferable to good minds; but which plea&s;ed men of a particular de&s;cription, but the mild and mode&s;t JULIA felt &s;o humbled by it at fir&s;t, that &s;he &s;eemed to &s;hrink from ob|&s;ervation, and it was &s;everal days before &s;he re|covered her u&s;ual ea&s;e and gentle dignity. The Italian was an old beau, but his heart was hone&s;t and his ideas often truly diverting.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s introduced JULIA as her ward, and as &s;he knew the power of wealth over the human heart, &s;he intimated that her fortune was con&s;iderable, this was done merely to &s;ave her young friend the mortifications that any &s;light or neglect would occa&s;ion. By the men &s;he was pronounced a divinity. Madamoi&s;elle was charmed with her, and as &s;he had a large &s;hare of penetration, had &s;tudied the mind of man, and knew the world; &s;he &s;aw that &s;ome my&s;tery hung around her, and &s;he was determined, though not from a bad motive, to develop it if po&s;&s;ible. But the prai&s;es that all concurred to give her, en&s;ured her of DONNA OLIVIA's envy; &s;he looked upon her as a &s;imple country girl, who&s;e beauty &s;he was obliged to acknowledge, but was in|intirely unacquainted with the <HI>beau monde,</HI> and treated her with that neglect that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed the world would approve of, and that was mo&s;t likely to pain her. But with all her &s;implicity
<PB N="72" REF="039134_0068_1013B01DD0DCC5C0">
the noble minded girl heeded not her neglects, and if &s;he felt it, her conduct was &s;uch as pro|claimed her innate &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>For one week the Chevalier was in love, he dre&s;&s;ed, danced, &s;ung and talked non&s;en&s;e, but all to no purpo&s;e; JULIA was diverted with his follies, and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound the pur&s;uit vain, and like a true Frenchman grew him&s;elf &s;ick of it.</P>
<P>DONNA OLIVIA exerted all her talents to plea&s;e the Count, and it is certain that he appear|ed to be plea&s;ed, and paid her an attention at once flattering to her, and &s;urprizing to his friends. The truth is, he was tired of his un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attentions to JULIA, and e&s;timating her by &s;ome that he had formerly known, he &s;uppo&s;|ed the fear of rivalry would alarm her jealou&s;y and wound her pride, and in the end &s;erve his purpo&s;e better than the marked re&s;pect and deference he had hitherto paid her. With this view he actu|ally made love to OLIVIA, who wi&s;hed for no|thing &s;o much as to &s;ecure her conque&s;t, and plea&s;ed with her lover, flattered her&s;elf that &s;he &s;hould &s;oon become Counte&s;s DE LAUNA; this idea was really &s;ugge&s;ted by an affection to the Count's per&s;on, independent of his rank and af|fluence; but for one moment it did not exi&s;t in his bo&s;om, he had never once thought of matri|monial fetters, unle&s;s JULIA, would put them on for him, &s;ince he cea&s;ed to teaze her with pro|fe&s;&s;ions that were irk&s;ome to hear, and which would have flattered the pride of mo&s;t women, only gave her pain; &s;he behaved with her u&s;ual ea&s;e and good humour, and was always calm and &s;erene. The Counte&s;s was happy to &s;ee her
<PB N="73" REF="039134_0069_1013B020868A7040">
friends and the whole party were mo&s;t agreeably entertained.</P>
<P>One morning, after the &s;ubject of conver&s;a|tion had &s;hifted &s;everal times, according to the whim or fancy of the company, it turned upon men of honor and the common acceptation of the word.</P>
<Q><L><HI>"HONOR's a &s;acred tye, the Law of Kings;</HI></L>
<L><HI>"The noble MIND's di&s;tingui&s;hing perfection."</HI></L></Q>
<P>What can be more binding upon a man of nice honor, (&s;aid the Count,) than his honor; what pledge to &s;acred, what &s;o &s;olemn! Why nothing replied the Counte&s;s,) nothing, and yet I do not believe the Engli&s;h Morali&s;t ever meant to have the &s;entiment you have quoted, applied to our modern men of honor, a principle of rectitude and of religion, will render the word of a plain hone&s;t man, of ten times more con&s;equence than what you call a principle of honor. And yet cried OLIVIA, the mind mu&s;t be mean and &s;u&s;|picious, that would not tru&s;t the word of a man of honour, even if it had not all the good quali|ties that you &s;eem to think nece&s;&s;ary. I think, (&s;aid the Counte&s;s) that a man has no rea&s;onable pretentions to honor, who is de&s;titute of tho&s;e requi&s;ites; and I am &s;ure no word was ever more wrongly applied; no term more pro&s;tituted, than that which is the &s;ubject of Conver&s;ation. The&s;e men of honor as you call them, and as they call them&s;elves, will undoubtedly defend their reputation, at the ri&s;que of their lives, even if that reputation, has been &s;tained with every infamous, every vicious deed; they will pay their debts of honor, and cheat the hone&s;t trade&s;man, who furni&s;hes them with the nece&s;&s;ary articles of
<PB N="74" REF="039134_0070_1013B02336204ED8">
life; they will fight for their king, their country, or their honor; but I believe there are but few of them who would not &s;educe the wife or daugh|ter of his friend, bring di&s;tre&s;s into his own family, bla&s;pheme his God, redicule religion, and trample upon all laws but tho&s;e of honor. In|deed I think (continued &s;he,) that a man mu&s;t act from higher principles, before he can be call|ed a man of honor, he mu&s;t be fearful to offend a God of purity, who &s;ees into his mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts, words and actions; he mu&s;t in com|pliance with the commands of that God, do to all men as he wi&s;hes to be done by; when this is the principle he proceeds upon, he will be lit|erally a man of honor, &s;uch a man may boa&s;t the noble di&s;tingui&s;hing perfection with propriety, and &s;uch a man is the American WASHINGTON, he has fought, bravely fought for his country, but I never heard of his fighting a duel: he has really protected the rights of man, and avenged the injuries of his fellow-citizens, but never brought &s;orrow or ruin to the families of his coun|trymen; in him, the wives, daughters and wi|dows of America find a friend and protector. Let no one henceforth claim the &s;acred title of a man of honour, unle&s;s he can like him, "keep a con&s;cience void of offence towards God and to|wards man." But a modern man of honor is a more dangerous character, than a downright knave, who is known to be a villain, and &s;corns not to be called &s;o; for the former acts in di&s;|gui&s;e, and in deceiving others, often deceives him|&s;elf; the world infatuated with the glare of his character, will admire, fear and tru&s;t him: per|haps,
<PB N="75" REF="039134_0071_1013B025DF74EEC8">
there are &s;ome who&s;e inclinations always &s;ide with the laws of honor and virtue, for we do find per&s;ons who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o tranquil a temper, and have &s;o happy a temperature of blood and &s;pirits, that they are inclined to do right and virtuous actions, even without any fixed principle; but the&s;e per&s;ons are in great danger of falling into temptation; their ea&s;e and imbecility of mind may betray them into evils, which require principle, and fixed ideas of vir|tue of &s;hun; and in general I am per&s;uaded where a principle of religion does not prove a &s;afeguard to honor, that however dazzling it ap|pears, when the inclinations, the intere&s;ts, or wi&s;h|es can be indulged at its expence, honor is found an in&s;ufficient barrier, and flies as a phantom of the morning, or as the <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> of a vapory night, and leaves the deluded wretch plunged in vice and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I know your a&s;&s;ertion to be ju&s;t (&s;aid Madam GYRON,) and I will produce an in&s;tance that has fallen within my own ob&s;ervation. A man of the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of honor, who had fought to e&s;tabli&s;h it, who was admired and even e&s;teemed by all, became at one and twenty, when his ideas of honor or rather his character was at its Zenith, the guardian of a young lady ju&s;t then fourteen, the daughter too of his be&s;t friend and protector: Her fortune was pretty con&s;iderable, her per&s;on rather plea&s;ing, her life had been innocent; her mind pure, and her heart unadulterated by art, or the world: But this man of honor within one year &s;educed her from the paths of virtue, deprived her of her honor, and rendered her a

wretch indeed; he was then married, but when five years afterwards he left his wife; when he had &s;tripped his unhappy ward of her for|tune, and left her in a Convent almo&s;t in want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, he then refu&s;ed her the only reparation in his power, and left her &s;till to &s;uffer: But when by the death of a di&s;tant rela|tion, &s;he became mi&s;tre&s;s of an ample and inde|pendent property indeed; this man of honor a|gain &s;ought her out and would again have de|ceived her, for he offered marriage: But &s;he nobly &s;corned him and &s;ought a great, a la&s;ting revenge, a revenge that has planted his pillow with thorns, and till this moment he lives a &s;uf|ferer in continual fear, that he &s;hall be puni&s;hed for a crime of which he is not guilty; but &s;till by &s;ome he is con&s;idered as a man of honor; his &s;tory is concealed, but how much better would a principle of religion and rectitude of heart have been, than this ideal, fanta&s;tic honor which he profe&s;&s;ed; the one would have &s;erved as a refuge in di&s;tre&s;s; would have &s;hielded him from the commi&s;&s;ion of guilt at which his &s;oul &s;hrinks with horror; would have left him peace of mind, if &s;u&s;pected, and he would not &s;hudder, as he now does, le&s;t the thunder bur&s;t over his head, and the red lightning bla&s;t his guilty con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>But (a&s;ked the Count,) what was the nature of this revenge; it could not be too great, for he was indeed a villain. That is a &s;ecret, &s;he replied, but it was great and glorious. The Counte&s;s was about to make &s;ome remarks upon revenge, and its con&s;equences; but upon ca&s;ting her eyes

upon Madam GYRON'S face, &s;he beheld it unu|&s;ually flu&s;hed, her eyes &s;parkled with the fire of pa&s;&s;ion, and her whole frame appeared &s;o ag|itated, that &s;he dropped the conver&s;ation, and propo&s;ed a walk.</P>

<P>I REFER you, dear Madam, to a letter, that I ye&s;terday wrote your amiable ward, for my &s;en|timents of gratitude, love and friend&s;hip, and have now &s;et down to follow your direction, and &s;hall endeavour to write in &s;uch a manner, as will afford you &s;atisfaction, and &s;hall think my&s;elf very happy, if I am &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The very day of my arrival, after a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age, I was &s;o fortunate, as to hear of my un|fortunate cou&s;in; poor girl, her wretched hu&s;|band it &s;eems is no more, and now upon the banks of Kennebeck, almo&s;t upon the confines of the United States, &s;he has found a &s;helter, and but for &s;ome humane per&s;ons there, &s;he mu&s;t have &s;uffered every evil of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s.

Within the la&s;t week, I have made my bow to many, and delivered my letters of recommendation, and in con&s;equence of them, been waited upon by many gentlemen, and entertained with a magnifi|cence that was to me quite unexpected; plain ho&s;pitality would have been much more plea&s;ing. I a&s;&s;ure your lady&s;hip, that this new world imi|tates the old, &s;o well, that it would be difficult to &s;ay which is the original; the gentlemen have their clubs and gaming tables, and the ladies have, what in London, would be called routes, but in this town are termed mere tea parties; even cards are not mentioned, but they are con|&s;tantly introduced, and met with every where; the ladies play as high as circum&s;tances will per|mit, and though the fatal mania, that has de&s;troyed &s;o many families, has not ari&s;en to that height here, that it has in Europe, I think the wor&s;t con&s;equences may be expected, and I have never beheld a beautiful women &s;eated at the card table without thanking heaven, that &s;he was neither my wife, or &s;i&s;ter, it has always appeared not on|ly ridiculous, but mean, that our very amu&s;ement &s;hould become a matter of traffic, and that we cannot &s;pend an evening without &s;uffering di&s;|cordant pa&s;&s;ions to interrupt our &s;erenity, with the hope of gain, or fear of lo&s;s; it is indeed wor&s;e than lo&s;s of time, for it is vainly trifling with what is mo&s;t precious&mdash;our temper and di&s;|po&s;ition; it is indeed &s;poiling both; for I have never met with a woman who had practiced gam|ing one year, but evil pa&s;&s;ions had &s;o coroded her heart, that they were imprinted upon her face, and gloom and di&s;appointment, over&s;pread that

face upon which &s;miles and good humour u&s;ed to appear in their mo&s;t bewitching charms. How much more amiable, how much more feminine does woman appear, when conver&s;ation or books, or any other rational employment con&s;tituted there amu&s;ement, or occupied there time, than when &s;pending it in this &s;hameful manner; and what dependence can be put upon a woman who&s;e good humor depends upon the turning up of a card, or who&s;e cheerfulne&s;s may be di&s;pelled by the ca&s;ting of a dice. But I will hope that here, as well as in Paris or London, there are many even of the fir&s;t councils, who have never &s;huffled a pack of cards, or &s;hook a dice box.</P>
<P>A few evenings &s;ince, I was &s;o fortunate as to be introduced to two ladies who are famous in the literray world; Mrs. MORTON, the darling daughter of the mu&s;es, who writes under the &s;ig|nature of Philenia, and Mrs. MURRAY, the refin|ed and the elegant Morali&s;t, who has taken that of CONSTANTIA; the&s;e ladies are very different, and both very engaging; Mrs. MORTON is &s;till a very lovely woman, though &s;he is the mother of a con&s;iderable family, and has grown up daugh|ters: her Beacon-hill, an epic poem that I have read before I left Europe, is enough to place her in the fir&s;t grade of poets, but I have &s;ince I come here, &s;een &s;ome little fugitive pieces that are &s;oft|er, and I think brighter effu&s;ions of genius.</P>
<P>I have &s;eldom met with a woman who conver|&s;es more &s;en&s;ibly or with more propriety upon every &s;ubject, than Mrs. MURRAY; &s;he has lately publi&s;hed the Gleaner, a periodical work, in three volumes, that does great honor both to

<P>Your lady&s;hip will perhaps wonder to hear me talking of good hou&s;ewifery and economy, for through I have the honor to addre&s;s the Coun|te&s;s DE LAUNA, yet I have been brought up in a merchant's family, and my good aunt plumed her&s;elf upon her good management, and was real|ly

one of the mo&s;t notable dames in the world: Be&s;ides you have told me what a charming little dairy woman my JULIA was, when you fir&s;t found the dear Cottager; and the perfect order that pre&s;ides at the Villa convince me that your Lady&s;hip has not a contempt for what in an high &s;tation may be con&s;idered only as a &s;ubaltern virtue; but in the middle &s;tyle of life, as well as among&s;t the indu&s;trious citizens and trade&s;men, ought to be held of the highe&s;t grade, and the want of it has brought mi&s;ery and ruin upon many a family; a &s;teady pur&s;uit of economy and attendance upon dome&s;tic affairs would have pre|&s;erved from di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I have been more than once delighted when bu&s;ine&s;s has obliged me to call upon a mechanic, to find at an early hour his wife up, his breakfa&s;t ready; his children clean, &amp; his humble habitation in order; &s;miles of unaffected cheerfulne&s;s have over&s;pread every face, and irradiated every coun|tenance, and he has looked forward to increa&s;e of wealth and re&s;pectability, through the agreeable medium of indu&s;try in him&s;elf, and good manage|ment of his wife. I have more than once too left this plea&s;ing picture of dome&s;tic bli&s;s, and after an hour or two, called upon &s;ome of my more fa&s;hionable acquaintance, I have there beheld ju&s;t at twelve, or perhaps one, ju&s;t ri&s;en from her unea&s;y &s;lumbers, a woman who apeing high life, has &s;pent her night at the virgils of the card ta|ble, and who has been &s;acrificing her hu&s;band's property, her own reputation and honor at the haunts of di&s;&s;ipation, and upon the altar of folly: Gloom, chagrin and caprice, have been pictured
<PB N="84" REF="039134_0080_1013B03E643AD378">
upon every feature of her face, and her fa&s;hionable di&s;habille has been far le&s;s becoming, than the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar&s;e, but clean calico in the former hou&s;e, while &s;mart replies and deep fetch'd &s;ighs, have declared the hu&s;band's heart ill at ea&s;e; and want of regularity at the breakfa&s;t-table, and order in the room, that ruin and hornebred quarrels were following clo&s;e upon the heels of bad manage|ment.</P>
<P>Thus it is, my dear Madam, our father's toil hard to give us an education, we become gentle|men, and mo&s;t readily &s;pend what has been earn|ed by the &s;weat of their brows, and ours &s;ons or grand-&s;ons at farthere&s;t mu&s;t return to labor or all the ills of poverty: I am now, my dear Ma|dam, &s;peaking of tho&s;e in a middling rank of life, and my thoughts have not a&s;pired at nobility; indeed my acquaintance with tho&s;e have been limited, for though I have now and then met with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or a lady Sarah, and been a few times in company with &s;ome of our nobility, yet I can only boa&s;t of knowing the Counte&s;s DE LAU|NA, and in her and her family have met with an|cient ho&s;pitality, and every other noble and con|de&s;cending virtue.</P>
<P>La&s;t evening I went to the theatre for the fir&s;t time, and acknowledge I went with an un|rea&s;onable prejudice upon my mind; u&s;ed alone to the play hou&s;es in London, I had no idea that I &s;hould meet with a good hou&s;e or good per|formers, the play was the production of one of our be&s;t Engli&s;h poets, and I was mo&s;t agreeably &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find the ornaments and &s;cenery, not only pretty and well fancied, but really elegant,
<PB N="85" REF="039134_0081_1013B04130829440">
and before the end of the fir&s;t act, I became &s;o much intere&s;ted by the ju&s;t as well as comic act|ing, that my mind &s;trayed not from the &s;tage for the evening: I was much plea&s;ed with both the male, as well as the female actors; and am in|clined to think if due incouragement is given, that Mr. HODCKINSON, will become as famous both in comedy and tragedy, as GARRICK was in Great-Britain. Many things have been &s;aid and written again&s;t theatrical amu&s;ements in this town, and much oppo&s;ition was made to the building of a theatre; I have heard the arguments upon both &s;ides, and confe&s;s I am inclined to think a well regulated play-hou&s;e, and a well cho&s;en, and well performed play, can never injure the morals or manners of a per&s;on of any worth, and of what con&s;equence are tho&s;e, who are alrea|dy &s;poiled? The human mind is ever in pur&s;uit of &s;omething; it requires amu&s;ement to relax it after bu&s;ine&s;s, and tho&s;e who are too great, or too indolent to attend to bu&s;ine&s;s or improvement, will &s;eek amu&s;ement at the tavern or gaming ta|ble, if no better place pre&s;ents, and I am much mi&s;taken if either of them are more injurious to the minds, health and e&s;tate of our young men, than a theatre, and I have no doubt, but if one was not permitted, &s;ome more detrimental mode of &s;pending time, would be invented and without its utility.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded your patience is quite exhau&s;t|ed by this long letter, but I have followed your directions, and tried to prove whether your a&s;|&s;ertion was ju&s;t, when you &s;aid, it could never be tired of the letters of your friends. I &s;hall leave

<P>THE Count had been a concerned &s;pecta|tor of JULIA'S emotion, at receiving COLWORT'S letter, and though the omen that he drew from it was di&s;couraging; he was determined to make one more attempt, to gain her affections in an honorable way, and if he &s;ucceeded, to be as much reformed, and for as long a time as po&s;&s;ible; but if he failed, to pre&s;s a project that his own dark bo&s;om had long harbored.</P>
<P>With this view, he followed her to a little &s;ummer-hou&s;e, in the garden, after dinner; as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw him, &s;he prepared to leave him, and pur&s;ue her walk; I intreat, Mademoi&s;elle, (&s;aid he with &s;ome &s;olemnity) that you will re|&s;ume your &s;eat, and permit me the plea&s;ure of a few moments conver&s;ation with you; &s;he was &s;ilent, but &s;at down; after a little he&s;itation he re&s;umed: It is now four months &s;ince I have known you, and in that time, do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that my heart has not cea&s;ed to beat for you, nor for one moment has my mind been em|ployed on any other &s;ubject: He was going on, but &s;he interrupted him, with, I am &s;orry to hear
<PB N="88" REF="039134_0084_1013B0480CFCE7C8">
it, my Lord, I hoped indeed that your mind had regained its u&s;ual occupations, and was employed, in a more u&s;eful manner; I beg your Lord&s;hip will not think me di&s;re&s;pectful, but I wi&s;h to be excu&s;ed from &s;aying any thing more, upon a &s;ub|ject that has already wa&s;ted too many moments; nothing has happened to change my mind, and I a&s;&s;ure you that it remains the &s;ame. "A few minutes (&s;aid he,) is no great &s;acrifice, even to an enemy, and &s;urely, JULIA, you will not deny that to me, while I plead &s;omething in my behalf that you have not yet attended to; I do not re|mind you of the ea&s;e and affluence that will be yours, if you con&s;ent to make me happy; nor do I mention a &s;plendid title; I know you are above &s;uch paltry con&s;iderations; but I would wi&s;h you to reflect one moment, upon the ad|vantages, they will mo&s;t certainly confer; &s;upe|rior to any you could ever receive in a connec|tion with the Chevalier COLWORT, if you &s;hould ever meet him again, which I think very uncer|tain; you have known this young adventurer but a &s;hort time; he has but a &s;mall fortune; you mu&s;t leave the friends who love you, to whom you are attached; you mu&s;t leave France, a charming country, where your cheerfulne&s;s will endear you, and make you re&s;pected, and re&s;ide among&s;t &s;trangers; upon that haughty, un&s;ocial I&s;land, you will be de&s;pi&s;ed; as a foreigner, parti|cularly as a French woman; for a depend upon it, no friend&s;hip, no amity can long &s;ub&s;i&s;t between a native of Britain and France; the aver&s;ion is rooted, it cannot be era&s;ed; it will embitter your future days, and render you unhappy; tied down

to their cold and frigid rules, you will be with|out the con&s;olations of love or friend&s;hip; for they are capable of neither; but if you con&s;ent to give me your hand, you will live with the Counte&s;s who loves you; you will be adored as the mi&s;tre&s;s of all around you, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of unbounded wealth will give you the power to &s;uccour the afflicted, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the needy. My former life, has not been what I could wi&s;h, for upon reflection, I have been guilty of follies that I grieve for; of imprudence, that I regret; but it is rather my misfortune, than my fault; for I am per&s;uaded. I never &s;hould have erred as I have done, if I had, at an early period of my life met a JULIA: It is in your power to perfect a reformation; it is with you to &s;ave me not only from pre&s;ent &s;orrow, but perhaps from future mi&s;ery; you will make my father happy by pre|&s;enting his &s;on a penitent and reformed: Oh, JULIA, do not turn from me an averted face; do not be deaf to my intreaties, but &s;mile upon me, and give me that dear hand, and &s;ay you will be mine.</P>
<P>I am grieved, my Lord, (&s;aid JULIA, as &s;oon as he had cea&s;ed &s;peaking,) that you &s;hould after four months acquaintance with me, entertain &s;o poor, and &s;uffer me to &s;ay &s;o unju&s;t an opinion of me, as to &s;uppo&s;e me &s;o un&s;table, and &s;o incon|&s;i&s;tent: I wi&s;h you happy, my Lord: I wi&s;h it for your own &s;ake, for that of your excellent fa|ther, and for your much loved aunt: If you have been guilty of follies, I hope you will in future be more circum&s;pect; a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done wrong generally precedes repentance, and
<PB N="90" REF="039134_0086_1013B04ECA39E798">
from my &s;oul, I wi&s;h you happy; I wi&s;h you may find a woman much more capable of making you happy, and more capable to move in &s;o high a &s;phere, than the humble girl you now addre&s;s. I feel the force of what you have &s;aid; am &s;en&s;i|ble of the honour you do me; but, my Lord, why will you wi&s;h to deprive me of the only qua|lity that would entitle me to your e&s;teem? In becoming yours, my Lord, I mu&s;t forfeit my vows, break through a &s;acred and &s;olemn engage|ment; a voluntary engagement too, and thus lo&s;e my own good opinion, and lo&s;e with it all hopes of happine&s;s. No, my Lord, I am incapable of a conduct &s;o vain, &s;o trifling, and &s;o frivolous: I refu&s;e the profound honor, my Lord, becau&s;e I am engaged to another, and becau&s;e wealth, and a title however adorned, however noble and exalt|ed, could not compen&s;ate to me the lo&s;s of my probity; the lo&s;s of the man I &s;incerely love and e&s;teem, and &s;uffer me to &s;ay, the lo&s;s of your Lord&s;hip's good opinion.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e to leave him, but he threw him&s;elf between her and the door, with a countenance inflamed by anger, and a frame agitated by con|flicting pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;wore &s;he &s;hould not leave him: think for a moment, (&s;aid he,) before you &s;eal your ruin, this is the la&s;t time I will ever put it in your power to reject or receive; I have al|ready thrown away too much time upon you, but you &s;hall be mine, be heaven, you &s;hall.</P>
<P>Never, my Lord, (&s;he replied,) I never will be yours, nor will I &s;eal my ruin, by giving a con&s;ent to what I &s;hould dete&s;t my&s;elf; for, reflecting upon for a moment, with any degree of compla|cency.
<PB N="91" REF="039134_0087_1013B0518789FE20">
Never, cried he, enraged; the time will come, when with all the ardent fondne&s;s of your &s;ex, you will beg in vain for the honor you now reject; by heaven, he added, while fury fla&s;hed in his eyes, I am half a mind to murder you and my&s;elf; but the time will come, for revenge, when, and that &s;hortly too, you will repent this madne&s;s; but penitence will then come too late, and &s;elf reflections will render you doubly wretch|ed; you &s;hall never &s;ee that cur&s;ed adventurer more, never &s;ee again that infatuating &s;avage.</P>
<P>I rejoice, my Lord, (replied &s;he, almo&s;t &s;miling from the complacency of the idea,) I rejoice that your power is not adequate to your will, and that my fate is in the hands of one, who can controul both you and I at plea&s;ure; who with one thought can bid this whirlwind of the pa&s;&s;ions cea&s;e, who will never put it in the power of a vain mortal, to &s;ay what &s;hall, or what &s;hall not be done; there is no &s;ituation, my Lord, above his reach, nor no one &s;o humble as to be below his conde&s;cending care and kindne&s;s; he has promi&s;|ed to protect the orphan, and as &s;uch, my Lord, I will depend upon him: Let me go, &s;aid &s;he, firmly, I in&s;i&s;t upon being detained no longer; I in&s;i&s;t upon pa&s;&s;ing, and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed him with a &s;pirit that amazed him; leaving him a&s;toni&s;hed at her fortitude, and his mind a prey to conflict|ing pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But the fortitude of JULIA for&s;ook her; as &s;oon as &s;he had left him, a kind of indignant de&s;|peration had &s;upported her in his pre&s;ence, but &s;he hurried to her chamber, bur&s;t into tears, and was giving full vent to her emotions, when &s;he
<PB N="92" REF="039134_0088_1013B054465EA938">
was interrupted by Madam GYRON, who had been in pur&s;uit of her, and was &s;urprized to find her in &s;uch a &s;ituation: Dear Mademoi&s;elle, &s;aid &s;he, what is the matter? JULIA could not an|&s;wer; what is the matter &s;he repeated, it is not a reprehen&s;ible curio&s;ity, for that I could &s;up|pre&s;s, it is a better motive that makes me inquire into this extraordinary emotion, perhaps my ad|vice may be of &s;ervice to you; do my dear JULIA, confide in me, and whatever may have cau&s;ed your grief, it &s;hall be a &s;ecret, if you wi&s;h it, and I am &s;ure you will never repent the confidence that I &s;olicit.</P>
<P>It was indeed a relea&s;e to JULIA to unfold to this friendly and &s;en&s;ible woman, the pre&s;ent cau&s;e of her &s;orrows, and to receive with gratitude the advice &s;he offered her: Madam told her in re|turn, that &s;he highly approved of her refu&s;al, and &s;pirited behaviour: I know him to be a villain, (&s;he added,) I know &s;uch things of him as make me &s;hudder only to think of; but his threats are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, for he is powerful and ma|licious: I would have you behave as u&s;ual to him; he will, I fancy, &s;oon leave the Villa, and then con&s;traint will be no longer nece&s;&s;ary; but do not inflame him to revenge, by informing his aunt, till his departure, and I believe we &s;hall all be glad of his ab&s;ence. I fancy, &s;aid JULIA, DONNA OLIVIA will not acquie&s;ce in your &s;enti|ments, but I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he does not know him as he is. DONNA OLIVIA, my dear, has been u&s;ed to affluence from her cradle, &s;he cannot ex|i&s;t without it; her family is ruined, her fortune &s;pent, &s;he loves the Count, and &s;uch are her ideas
<PB N="93" REF="039134_0089_1013B0571A31BFE0">
that &s;he would accompany him to the Altar, though he &s;tood confe&s;&s;ed the villain before her, and &s;he knew that his heart was engaged to you.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, (&s;aid JULIA,) that any one can think or feel &s;o? Why, I had rather labor for bread, and receive the &s;canty pittance of hard earned indu&s;try, than to be the wife of &s;uch a man. And &s;o had I, (replied Madam,) but my dear, we mu&s;t go down; take no notice of what has pa&s;&s;ed, and I will contrive, in a day or two, to free you from &s;uch a con&s;traint, as the pre&s;ence of that wretch will inflict.</P>
<P>They then joined the company, and had the &s;atisfaction to find the Count was not with them: indeed he was too much di&s;compo&s;ed to a&s;&s;ociate with any one, and with a confidential &s;ervant had rode out. This man had been long a faithful auxiliary, and he now di&s;clo&s;ed to him, &s;chemes of the blacke&s;t die; nor did the fellow mi&s;s this opportunity to inform his ma&s;ter &s;ome hints that had dropped from a &s;ervant of Madam GYRON's, which the guilty con&s;cience of both the Count and the man immediately &s;ugge&s;ted, alluded to a tran&s;action that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years before, and fearful le&s;t any thing more &s;hould be &s;aid, he concluded to leave the Villa.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance with this re&s;olution, he did not return untill the Counte&s;s and her gue&s;ts had retir|ed; he then waited upon the Marquis in his bed|chamber, and formed an excu&s;e that obliged him to depart immediately for Paris; the Marquis admitted his excu&s;e, and at his reque&s;t con&s;ented to &s;ay every thing to the Counte&s;s and her friends that was nece&s;&s;ary: He took leave of his father
<PB N="94" REF="039134_0090_10136EAE49797DC8">
that night, and before the ri&s;ing of the next &s;un, was with all his attendants, half a league from the Villa.</P>
<P>The company were &s;urpri&s;ed to find he had left them in that abrupt manner, but all readily admitted his excu&s;es, except DONNA OLIVIA, who could not conceal her chagrin, and di&s;appointment; but before night &s;he received a &s;ummons to vi&s;it her brother who was very ill, and Madam, GYRON, who had come in the &s;ame carriage readily agreed to return with her, and the Chevalier &s;ignified his intentions of accompany|ing them the next day.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s unwilling to be &s;o &s;oon depriv|ed of the &s;ociety of her friend, urged her longer &s;tay, and the Marquis and JULIA added their mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing per&s;ua&s;ions to her invitation, but &s;he pleaded &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s that mu&s;t be &s;oon at|tended to, and promi&s;ed a longer vi&s;it when the coming winter had excluded other vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>The Italian concluded to &s;tay a few days lon|ger at the Villa, and then return immediately to Spain, and not go again to Paris. The next day he remarked that JULIA, had a happy mixture of the French and Italian in her countenance: You have all the vivacity of the one, &s;aid he, with all the bewitching &s;oftne&s;s of the other; was your father a Frenchman, Mademoi&s;elle? Indeed I do not know, (&s;he replied,) while the crim&s;on that mantled upon her check, di&s;covered that her mind had underwent a &s;udden emotion. Not know, (he repeated, amazed at her an&s;wer;) not know of what country your father was? I never was &s;o happy as to know a father, (&s;he
<PB N="95" REF="039134_0091_1013B05DACD8F8E8">
&s;aid, while her voice trembled as &s;he &s;poke.) Was your mother an Italian? &s;he interrogated.) Of that I am likewi&s;e ignorant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I believe &s;he was a native of France. Perceiving that his que&s;tions embarra&s;&s;ed her, he dropt them, and &s;oon after &s;ought the Counte&s;s, who finding he knew &s;ome|thing of JULIA, told him part of her &s;tory with a &s;trict injunction of &s;ecrecy. In a few days he left them, and the Counte&s;s, her brother, and JULIA, again enjoyed that &s;ocial intercour&s;e which con&s;titutes the &s;weete&s;t happine&s;s of congenial &s;ouls.</P>

<P>IN about four weeks they were &s;urprized one afternoon by the arrival of a number of men at|tended by two officers, who entered the apart|ment, in which the Counte&s;s and her friend were &s;eated, without ceremony, and &s;eized upon JU|LIA, as a pri&s;oner of &s;tate: It would be impo&s;|&s;ible to expre&s;s the &s;urpri&s;e or di&s;tre&s;s of the Counte&s;s, and the trembling girl; they begged an explanation, and de&s;ired to know for what &s;he was arre&s;ted; what was the crime alledged again&s;t one &s;o innocent and inoffen&s;ive. I &s;hould be &s;orry to offend your lady&s;hip, &s;aid one of the officers, I only do my duty, nor do I know for what Mademoi&s;elle is arre&s;ted; here is my war|rant which you may read.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s read with a&s;toni&s;hment, and found it was under the great &s;eal, and that it com|manded to &s;eize the per&s;on of JULIA VALLAICE, a re&s;ident at the Villa of the Counte&s;s DE LAU|NA, and conduct her to the frontiers of the King|dom, and then deliver her up to the Spani&s;h Offi|cer, who was one of the pre&s;ent company. It was in vain for the Counte&s;s to expatiate with the&s;e men, or to oppo&s;e a power &s;o &s;uperior; the Mar|quis

had rode out, and all that &s;he could do was to a&s;&s;ure JULIA, that &s;he and her brother would mo&s;t certainly her; that they would fir&s;t attend at Court and obtain all the information nece&s;&s;ary, and u&s;e all their power for her relea&s;e. It was in vain that &s;he per&s;uaded them to tarry till the return of the Marquis, and till her car|riage could be got ready. All the indulgence that could be obtained was for JULIA to take a trunk of clothes, and that ANET &s;hould go with her in a carriage, which they had brought for the purpo&s;e of carrying her. The Counte&s;s put a pur&s;e into her hand at parting, and gave another to the officers, who promi&s;ed &s;he &s;hould have ev|ery care and attention paid her during her journey. She hung upon the neck of her generous benefac|tre&s;s, &s;he wept upon her bo&s;om, while the Coun|te&s;s half di&s;tracted, knew not what to do, or how to conduct her&s;elf. Tru&s;t in your innocence, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, tru&s;t in him who is the father of orphans, and the friend of the afflicted. Oh, Madam, and mu&s;t I leave you, mu&s;t I indeed be dragged from you? We part, but for a &s;hort time, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, I will be with you in a few days; &s;he could add no more, for the officers &s;eparated them, and put the trembling JULIA into a carriage that waited.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action was &s;o &s;udden, and &s;o unex|pected; the tran&s;ition from liberty and happi|ne&s;s, to &s;lavery and mi&s;ery; from all the ble&s;&s;ings of friend&s;hip, and the mo&s;t elegant and refined &s;ociety, to the company of men who&s;e per&s;ons were unplea&s;ing; who&s;e manners were rough and di&s;agreeable; had taken place in &s;o &s;hort a time,
<PB N="98" REF="039134_0094_1013B064AD35B718">
that when JULIA found her&s;elf &s;hut up in a clo&s;e carriage with the officers, and ANET, &s;he could hardly &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf awake; &s;he thought it mu&s;t be a dream, and &s;he tried to &s;hake off the fetters of &s;leep, that &s;he might e&s;cape from &s;o dreadful a vi&s;ion. But her efforts were vain, &s;he found indeed it was a reality, a painful reality; and in&s;tead of the &s;oothing, the &s;entimental friend, the charming Counte&s;s, &s;he was driving from her, in company, that &s;he almo&s;t feared to look upon.</P>
<P>She endeavored to recollect every pa&s;&s;age of her life, to look back upon her infant hours, to form &s;ome probable conjecture, if po&s;&s;ible, for what crime &s;he was now a pri&s;oner, but it was in vain; &s;he only ran&s;acked the annals of an inno|cent heart, of a life void of offence. She then &s;earched the records of her memory for an enemy, and here indeed &s;he was more &s;ucce&s;sful, for re|flection in a moment pre&s;ented the Count, he had threatened her with vengeance, and now in idea her accu&s;er, her judge, and her jailor, &s;tood con|fe&s;&s;ed, the Count DE LAUNA. She &s;addened at the horrid thought, and the hints and caution of Madam GYRON, ru&s;hed upon her mind, and brought &s;uch a confu&s;ion of afflicting images and &s;u&s;picio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, that &s;he almo&s;t &s;unk under them.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate &s;he was recalled by the tears of ANET, who &s;at crying oppo&s;ite to her, and who had for a few minutes been forgotten: &s;he now endeavored to comfort the little girl, by an a&s;&s;urance that the Counte&s;s would &s;oon follow, and that whatever happened to her&s;elf, &s;he would be taken care of; the voice of JULIA, who &s;tiffled her own unea&s;ine&s;s, and appeared as calm
<PB N="99" REF="039134_0095_1013B0662F7B0780">
as po&s;&s;ible, operated like a charm upon her af|fectionate attendant, and re&s;tored her to tranquil|ity: She a&s;&s;ured her lady that &s;he would gladly go with her all over the world, and that &s;he was only di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for the Counte&s;s, and her, and would be quite ea&s;y as to what concerned her&s;elf.</P>
<P>JULIA now began to que&s;tion the officers con|cerning the cau&s;e of her arre&s;t; the Frenchman could not, and the Spaniard would not give her any information, and after a few fruitle&s;s enqui|ries, they all continued &s;ilent, and the mind of JULIA, wandered back to the Villa, which was now for behind her; &s;he &s;aw, in imagination, the anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s of the Marquis, and his &s;i&s;ter, and almo&s;t fancied &s;he heard their voices, as they talked of her; &s;he &s;ometimes too, thought of COLWORT, and a &s;igh followed. Her uncertainty was an aggravation to the angui&s;h of her heart, and &s;he wi&s;hed this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence over, let the end be ever &s;o dreadful; for &s;he thought a cer|tainty of the wor&s;t, could not exceed her pre&s;ent affliction. In con&s;ideration of her attendant, &s;he concealed her fears and combated with forti|tude the agonizing &s;urmi&s;es that &s;he could not di&s;mi&s;s: I every picture that her fancy drew, the Count &s;tood foremo&s;t, and there was no evil that &s;he dreaded, that could bear any compari&s;on to tho&s;e &s;he feared from him, and her heart &s;unk at the idea of meeting him.</P>
<P>It is not our intention to de&s;cribe her journey, nor the towns and villages &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through; they only &s;topped to change hor&s;es, and for refre&s;h|ment, and travelled with &s;uch expedition, as left JULIA, no hope of being overtaken by her friends,
<PB N="100" REF="039134_0096_1013B16456EDFEC0">
until they reached the place of their de&s;tination. Upon the frontiers of the kingdom, the French officer left them, and JULIA had rea&s;on to regret his departure: The Frenchman was humane and civil, he had told her the names of the towns they had pa&s;&s;ed, and given her &s;ome &s;ketches of the inhabitants, and &s;he had endeavored to dive&s;t her&s;elf of per&s;onal fears, enough to attend; in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;he had &s;ucceeded, and &s;he found his communications a &s;ource of &s;atisfaction: But the Spani&s;h officer, who now took her into his cu&s;tody, was haughty and vain, &s;upercilious and illnatured; and had be&s;ides a really weak under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>With this man &s;he continued &s;ome days lon|ger; had her con&s;titution been le&s;s firm, &s;he mu&s;t have &s;unk under the fatigue of &s;uch a jour|ney, with a per&s;on and mind &s;o harra&s;&s;ed by con|&s;tant fatigue and agitation: But a kind of de&s;|peration kept her up, and her fortitude &s;eemed to increa&s;e with her trials, and &s;he found the re&s;our|ces &s;he had within her&s;elf, more numerous, than &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the fifth day, they arrived at M&mdash;, and JULIA was told her journey was terminated here: But when the coach &s;topped before a large high hou&s;e, dark looking and ill contrived, &s;he trembled &s;o, &s;he could hardly alight, and her tottering limbs would &s;carce &s;up|port her, for &s;he there expected to meet the Count; but here &s;he was mi&s;taken, for &s;he was only met by too bad looking men, and an appa|rently innocent woman, who conducted her up two pair of &s;tairs into a large Chamber, with a
<PB N="101" REF="039134_0097_1013B06A379821C8">
&s;mall grated window, little furniture, and a bad fire; the weather was now cold, and &s;he felt the want of that cheering element; and when &s;he found her&s;elf only with ANET, and heard the door &s;hut and the key turned upon her, her heart died within her, and overcome with fatigue and cold, &s;he found her&s;elf incapable of taking off her out&s;ide garment, and &s;unk into a chair, and for a moment become in&s;en&s;ible either to the mi&s;eries of retro&s;pection or anticipation.</P>
<P>The cries of ANET, &s;oon brought up the wo|man, who exerted her&s;elf for the relief of JULIA, and her recovered rea&s;on was &s;oftened by &s;en&s;i|bility, which by a gu&s;h of tears, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, relieved her almo&s;t bur&s;ting heart: She accepted the repa&s;t that the woman had provided and be|coming in &s;ome mea&s;ure calm; &s;he &s;uffered the bed to be warmed, and went immediately to it, after in&s;i&s;ting upon her little attendant being a partaker of it. This was the fir&s;t time &s;he had been undre&s;&s;ed &s;ince &s;he had left the Villa, for the purpo&s;e of repo&s;e, and it now &s;eemed to fly from her intreaties, and &s;he wooed it with wi&s;hes that &s;eemed to drive it far from her; but towards day &s;he &s;unk into a profound &s;lumber, and did not awake, till the woman, &s;he had &s;een the night before, came to inform her that two per&s;ons wait|ed in an adjourning apartment to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e to dre&s;s her&s;elf with &s;uch a confu&s;ion of thought, and hurry of &s;pirit, that &s;he could hardly put on her clothes; her face was pale and languid, a faint blush ju&s;t tinged her cheeks; her hair which had not been dre&s;&s;ed for many days fell in a kind of natural curl about her neck and

forehead, and though her eyes had not lo&s;t their brilliancy, they were more &s;oft and gentle than u&s;ual; yet the mild and re&s;olute fortitude of her mind was impre&s;&s;ed upon her countenance, and &s;he prepared to accompany her attendant with dignity, tempered with &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>She was only led to an oppo&s;ite chamber, where &s;he found two per&s;ons, one a young man of a plea&s;ing but troubled a&s;pect, and the other an old one, who wore an appearance of di&s;content and &s;u&s;picion: They both met her at the door, and &s;eemed equally &s;urpri&s;ed at the elegance of her per&s;on, and manners; the glow upon her cheek was hightened to crim&s;on, by a &s;en&s;ation of ming|led fear and indignation of con&s;cious virtue and a&s;&s;ured innocence; with an air of re&s;pect they re|que&s;ted her to be &s;eated, and a&s;&s;ured her that no injury was intended her, and that if &s;he was not intirely &s;atisfied with her apartment, &s;he &s;hould immediately be put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a better: She replied that &s;he did not complain of her ac|commodation, &s;he only wi&s;hed to be informed upon what pretext &s;he had been torn from her friends, and treated and confined as a pri&s;oner. They replied, &s;he would &s;oon be informed of ev|ery circum&s;tance, and that reparation &s;hould be made for every appearance of injury &s;he had re|ceived; they then conver&s;ed upon different &s;ub|jects and dropped no hint of what related to her confinement and &s;ituation; &s;he endeavored to join in the conver&s;ation which was &s;everal times addre&s;&s;ed to her.</P>
<P>In near an hour after, three men entered, one of them produced the materials for writing, and
<PB N="103" REF="039134_0099_1013B06FD6917B28">
the others began to interrogate her concerning her former life. They explained to her the nature of an oath, and then with great &s;olemnity admini&s;|tered it to her, when &s;he laid her hand upon the book, which &s;he ob&s;erved to be the Bible, &s;he trembled, but &s;he lifted her heart up to heaven for &s;upport, and went through the awful ceremo|ny without he&s;itation. They a&s;ked her where &s;he was from? She an&s;wered that &s;he did not know. Where &s;he had lived? At Avignon, un|til about &s;ix months ago, &s;ince which, with the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA. Who were her parents? Her father &s;he had never known; her mother, &s;he de&s;cribed with the circum&s;tance of her lo&s;s. She an&s;wered all the&s;e que&s;tions with clearne&s;s, and without any apparent reluctance, and was a|gain with re&s;pect, conducted back to her apart|ment, and the door once more locked upon her.</P>

<P>IN a &s;hort time refre&s;hments were brought, of which &s;he eat, more, wi&s;h a view to gratify ANET, and induce her to follow her example, than from inclination. She then a&s;ked for a book, and a vo|lumn of Hannah Moor's Poems was brought her, this had been left by an Engli&s;h pri&s;oner, when he was liberated by accident; as &s;he under&s;tood the language almo&s;t as well as her own: She read it with plea&s;ure and delight; and in the peru&s;al of that beautiful poem, upon &s;en&s;ibility, almo&s;t lo&s;t her&s;elf, and her &s;orrows. But &s;ome lines that &s;eemed to allude to minds and &s;ituations like her own, brought her back from the illu&s;ive fields of poetry, and &s;he &s;ighed when &s;he looked upon her di&s;mal abode.</P>

She had been u&s;ed to active indu&s;try from her infancy; not an

hour of her life had pa&s;&s;ed unoccupied; &s;he con|&s;idered idlene&s;s as the parent of every evil, the nur&s;e of every vice, and employment as one of her great|e&s;t privileges; &s;he had always ari&s;en before the &s;un, and work, books and amu&s;ements, had filled up every moment; &s;he never had found the day too long; but now, &s;hut up in a lonely pri&s;on; no book, no work, no mu&s;ick, and no one to conver&s;e with, except ANET, &s;he found the time hung heavy upon her hands, and "chide the tardy minutes as they pa&s;s.' She got the keeper of the pri&s;on to procure her the implements for drawing, and &s;ome books; the fir&s;t he got agreeable to her direction; but he had no ta&s;te, and was ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious, and he brought her &s;ome devo|tional tracts, and &s;he threw them by, for neither in&s;truction nor amu&s;ement could be gathered from them.</P>
<P>She had &s;ome turn for drawing, but what could &s;he exerci&s;e that talent upon; her high grated window only gave her the pro&s;pect of a dark nar|row &s;treet, with a large brick building, the back of which was towards her, and which &s;eemed con|trived to prevent the rays of light or whole&s;ome air, from entering her gloomy apartment, it in|deed &s;ufficiently excluded them, for &s;he had not &s;een the &s;un, &s;ince her re&s;idence in it.</P>
<P>She indeed &s;ketched the figure of &s;ome haughty Spaniards as they walked by in &s;olemn &s;tate, wrapped up in their black cloaks; but the &s;amene&s;s, &s;oon tired her, and &s;he could not row as formerly, draw from imagination; her heart was chearle&s;s, and her mind too gloomy, and &s;he cho&s;e not to tinge the canvas with tho&s;e &s;ombre &s;hades, and &s;he threw by the pencil;
<PB N="106" REF="039134_0102_1013B07838973E60">
her mind was inventive, &s;he a&s;ked the woman that attended her, for work; plain u&s;eful &s;ewing &s;he preferred, and &s;he was &s;oon furni&s;hed, and in this found a re&s;ource again&s;t her &s;orrows, and a &s;olace in her affliction. She in&s;tructed ANET to work, and the jailor's wife began to find a benefit from their indu&s;try.</P>
<P>While her fingers were &s;o u&s;efully employed, her mind was at liberty to range at plea&s;ure, and in imagination &s;he often vi&s;ited the Villa; often felt the embraces of the Counte&s;s, and her bro|ther; often too, fancy repre&s;ented them as com|ing to her relief, and &s;he accompanied them in their journey, found them &s;topped at the door of her pri&s;on, li&s;tened to every noi&s;e or ring of the bell, and almo&s;t expected to &s;ee them enter her apart|ment. Some times too, &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the Altantic, and beheld her beloved COLWORT enjoying all the plea&s;ures of liberty and peace, improving his mind by ob&s;ervation, or occupied in &s;oothing the broken &s;pirit of his cou&s;in, and cheri&s;hing her infant with tenderne&s;s and benevolence.</P>
<P>Her mind had never known &s;u&s;picion, and &s;he was &s;aved a va&s;t deal of unea&s;ine&s;s, that mean di&s;po&s;itions are &s;ubjected to; &s;he had never for one moment doubted, the continued affection and friend&s;hip of the Counte&s;s, or her brother, and a &s;hadow of jealou&s;y had not for one in&s;tant cloud|ed her dependance, upon the con&s;tancy of COL|WORT. She &s;ometimes gave way to fear; that &s;ickne&s;s prevented her friends from coming to her relief; and then, indeed, &s;he was wretched.</P>
<P>In le&s;s then a week, &s;he received another vi&s;it from the gentlemen who had waited upon her

at fir&s;t, underwent the &s;ame interrogatories, and returned the &s;ame an&s;wers; and was again recon|ducted to her pri&s;on. Six days pa&s;&s;ed on as u&s;ual, and her patience became almo&s;t exhau&s;ted; and when led again to the pre&s;ence of the per&s;ons, who had twice before que&s;tioned her, &s;he begged to know how long &s;he was to &s;uffer this confine|ment, and what was alledged again&s;t her? I wi&s;h, Madam, I could an&s;wer you, &s;aid the elde&s;t, but I cannot. And why not, cried JULIA, with &s;ome &s;pirit, I am unu&s;ed to a&s;k favors, but in this ca&s;e &s;urely, it is natural, and excu&s;able; I only beg to be informed, why I am thus confined? I have been torn from friends that I love, from a &s;ituation that was delightful, from &s;ociety that was deare&s;t to my heart, and hurried along for &s;everal hundred miles, and after that, confined in a dark and gloomy pri&s;on, without friends, with|out &s;ociety, and without amu&s;ement; not one intimation is given why I thus &s;uffer? To &s;uffer|ings, I am re&s;igned, and will be &s;atisfied with the decrees of tho&s;e who have my fate at their di&s;po|&s;al; all I a&s;k, is an end to this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, and I think I have a right to demand an an&s;wer, and a relief to the painful &s;en&s;ations that doubt occa&s;ions. Three weeks from this, Madamoi&s;elle, (returned her interrogator,) the Lord High Ad|vocate, with the other Judges, will return to this city, the court will then &s;et, and a final decree will be given. Good God, &s;aid JULIA, am I to be arraigned before the Lord High Advocate, and tried as a criminal, as a &s;tate offender; what have I ever done to merit this treatment?

the youth, nor are you to be brought as a criminal before any tribunal, and no one who looks upon you for a moment, would credit an a&s;&s;ertion &s;o improbable.</P>
<P>I did not wi&s;h for a compliment, &s;he an&s;wered, I only wi&s;h for information. And that, he &s;aid, is the only reque&s;t that cannot be granted; we are bound by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths, not to declare for what you are confined; if we break tho&s;e oaths, we are perjured. If that is the ca&s;e, &s;aid JULIA, &s;ighing, I mu&s;t aim at re&s;ignation; pa|tience is a virtue often called into exerci&s;e, and long and frequent u&s;e only, increa&s;es it; when our virtues lay dormant, and inactive, we do not ju&s;tly appreciate them; it is practice that &s;hews how really valuable they are, and how great their utility is. Indeed, &s;aid the young gentlemen, we are grieved for you, and wi&s;h for nothing more, than to have the power to relieve your mind from &s;u&s;pence, and your per&s;on from confinement. It is evident that you can practice every virtue; you are too lovely and amiable, to permit us to doubt it. Were I happy, &s;ighed JULIA, &s;eign|ior, perhaps your compliments might make me vain; I am at pre&s;ent too much the rever&s;e to be elated. He bowed, and &s;he was again led back to her chamber, with a heart doubly oppre&s;|&s;ed; &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw in the countenance of the young man, pity for her fate, while the old one &s;eemed to betray ill nature, and &s;quint &s;u&s;pi|cion. What they had &s;aid re&s;pecting a court and a final decree, created a thou&s;and new images of horror; her mind recurred to the direction &s;he had received from her mother, not to leave the

Cottage; again PIERRE, the &s;on of the old man, had &s;aid, her life when an infant, depended upon the concealment of her real name; that &s;he thought was now di&s;covered, and her life would than be &s;acrificed to &s;ome intere&s;ted enemy. She had often wi&s;hed, &s;he could remove the veil, that wrapped her birth in impenetrable ob&s;curity; that veil &s;he now &s;uppo&s;ed would be &s;oon re|moved, and her death clo&s;e the &s;cene; even to that &s;he looked with &s;ome degree of impatience; &s;o greatly did &s;u&s;pence aggravate every evil &s;he &s;uffered: In the affection of the Marquis and his &s;i&s;ter, &s;he was &s;ecure, and &s;he had expect|ed they would have come, or &s;ent to her &s;uccour: She &s;till hoped they would appear; but, the &s;ad idea occurred, that perhaps, they were withheld from giving her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by that hand of power, that had confined her: perhaps too, they had upon inquiries found her &s;tate &s;o hopele&s;s and de&s;perate, that every attempt was laid a&s;ide, as fruitle&s;s and unavailing. In the&s;e reflections &s;he indulged, until her mind became a perfect chaos, and &s;o much agitated, as to be little &s;hort of di&s;traction. She traver&s;ed her apartment with hurried &s;teps, till after ten, when &s;he heard a low &s;tep approach her door, the key was turned with evident caution, and &s;he beheld the young man enter, whom &s;he had &s;een in the morning.</P>
<P>He was alone, and approached her with evident confu&s;ion and re&s;pect. Forgive this intru&s;ion, &s;aid he, forgive this un&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it, which is meant, if po&s;&s;ible, to relieve you from &s;ome of the di&s;agreeable things that &s;urround you. Your meaning is &s;o very kind, replied JULIA, that I
<PB N="110" REF="039134_0106_1013B08319ED4C70">
am willing to overlook the impropriety. Have you any good news for me? Have my friends ar|rived? Is &s;u&s;pence and concealment no longer nece&s;&s;ary? I have heard nothing new, Madam|oi&s;elle, I do not even know your friends, and I am bound by a &s;olemn oath not to reveal the rea|&s;ons of your confinement. But the knowledge of it will injure no one, but my&s;elf; and free you from &s;u&s;pence, and I could not re&s;t till I had relieved you, even at the expence of my honor. And do you think, &s;aid JULIA, that I would buy tran&s;ient ea&s;e, to my&s;elf, at &s;uch a price? No &s;ir, if my curio&s;ity is not to be gratifi|ed, except at the expence of your truth, I will &s;acrifice that curio&s;ity, great as it is, and endure this &s;u&s;pence, until I may with honor be relieved from it. There was a heroi&s;m in the princi|ple, that exerted a &s;pirit that aro&s;e almo&s;t to en|thu&s;ia&s;m; it taught her the value of virtue, and learned her how much ea&s;ier it was to endure un|merited &s;ufferings, than plea&s;ure purcha&s;ed at the expence of truth, even of another; the fir&s;t &s;he had borne for weeks; her health was good, her nerves &s;trong, her capacities for reflection or rea|&s;oning, for bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ement, by no means impaired; her appetite as good as it could be without exerci&s;e; but, at the idea of the la&s;t her heart &s;ickened, her limbs trembled, &s;he became pale, and &s;he would not have involved a fellow creature in guilt, for a world and liberty.</P>
<P>The young gentleman gazed upon her with a&s;toni&s;hment; he had that morning &s;een her di&s;|tre&s;s; he ob&s;erved, &s;he had pleaded with an energy of language; with an air of affliction, and
<PB N="111" REF="039134_0107_10136EB542B3F888">
had almo&s;t melted the heart of his companion, and now when her &s;orrow was heightened by their refu&s;al, when anxiety and agitation was impre&s;&s;ed upon every intere&s;ting feature, &s;he could nobly refu&s;e to have her heart ea&s;ed, her curio&s;ity gratified, and her favorite reque&s;t granted, rather than &s;uffer a &s;tranger to forfeit his word, or to lo&s;e his honor. This was a &s;tretch of virtue, a no|ble height, to which CARLOS had never &s;uppo&s;|ed any mortal could a&s;pire to.</P>
<P>I am charmed with your character, Madam|oi&s;elle, &s;aid he, and hope that you will not enter|tain too low an opinion of me; your beauty and your &s;ufferings led me a&s;tray; your fortitude and honor have re&s;tored my &s;cattered rea&s;on, and I hope I &s;hall be able to follow &s;o noble an example. I thank you, &s;aid JULIA, for your con&s;ideration; to know that any one &s;ympathizes with me, is a relief to my &s;orrows; and I &s;hall always be grateful for the favor you intended me, for I &s;hall always remember what a price you would have paid. He he&s;itated a moment, he looked upon her face, and the virtue that had until then reign|ed in his heart, was not proof again&s;t her &s;oft and gentle beauty; he would have bartered it, to have made her happy, for it was death to &s;ee her mi&s;erable. It is in my power, Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid he, it is in my power to free you from con|finement, but &s;hall I do it, or not? you your&s;elf &s;hall determine; upon your deci&s;ion my fate now hangs; I will this night prepare a carriage, and &s;et out with you for your friends; but he added with a &s;igh, it is highly probable this may co&s;t a dear and re&s;pected father, his life; yet it
<PB N="112" REF="039134_0108_1013B085C7F4B288">
is a ri&s;que, I am willing to run; a &s;acrifice, I am willing to make; a proof that I am this moment ready to give. Heaven forbid it, &s;aid JULIA, I would rather &s;uffer impri&s;onment for life, with innocence, than by &s;uch a &s;tep incur the de&s;erved puni&s;hment of a guilty con&s;cience; no &s;eignior, I am at length content to await the decrees of fate and its appointed time, for my death or re|relief, but I will not involve you in my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and I advi&s;e you, &s;eignior, to appreciate virtue at too high a rate, than ever, even, for a moment of|fer to part with her; do not &s;uffer either your &s;ympathy or benevolence to betray you, to lo&s;e your honor or fortitude; they then become weak|ne&s;&s;es, and are no longer virtues. I entered your pri&s;on, he replied, with &s;en&s;ations very different from tho&s;e I &s;hall feel at leaving it, I then pitied you as unfortunate; I now envy you as one of the fir&s;t and noble&s;t of characters; but amid&s;t the glare of your virtues, I mu&s;t &s;till do homage to your beauties, I mu&s;t, Madamoi&s;elle, I mu&s;t de|vote my life, my&s;elf and fortune to you; Oh &s;uf|fer me to hope, that when this gloomy &s;cene has pa&s;&s;ed, when this eventful period has elap&s;ed, that one thing may be remembered with plea&s;ure; Oh promi&s;e when that time comes, to li&s;ten to my vows, and to unite your fate with mine. I &s;hould indeed be guilty, &s;he returned, of what I have always con&s;idered as unpardonable, if I he&s;itated to a&s;&s;ure you, that though you will al|ways po&s;&s;e&s;s my gratitude and e&s;teem; that all my more affectionate thoughts, have long been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another; let this be &s;ufficient, and drop the only &s;ubject that I cannot li&s;ten to with
<PB N="113" REF="039134_0109_1013B0899D090778">
plea&s;ure. I will obey you, &s;aid he, though no one can tell with what angui&s;h of heart I re|linqui&s;h an hope, and the only one, that I had permitted to irradiate my pro&s;pect; that pro&s;pect is alas, more dark, more gloomy than ever, for &s;hould the events of an approaching trial be as I apprehend, I &s;hall leave my country, and com|mence the life of a wretched wanderer, for how could I &s;upport life and rea&s;on in a country dyed with the blood of a parent. Since I have &s;een you, I have indeed encouraged an hope, that matters might not turn out &s;o badly, but be they what they will, I now find I have bid adieu to that tranquility that can make any place dear to me. Do not, interrupted JULIA, let &s;uch melancholy fears tinge your mind; things may all be well, and it is a folly to anticipate evils that may never ar|rive, and wi&s;dom to be deluded by hope; you are &s;till very young; I don't know what &s;cenes of &s;orrow you allude to, but there are but few &s;en|&s;ations, but may be effaced, and the tran&s;ient im|pre&s;&s;ion, that perhaps gives you pain at pre&s;ent, may and will &s;oon be forgotten. I fear not, Madamoi&s;elle, he replied; indeed I do not wi&s;h it, for if I am to gain tranquility only by lo&s;ing &s;ome of the mo&s;t delightful &s;en&s;ations; I own I have not fortitude to relinqui&s;h them. No greater proof can be given, cried JULIA, of the futility and folly of &s;uch &s;en&s;ations, than not wi&s;h|ing to part with them, when they are only pro|ductive of pain, and cannot be indulged with honor; for my part, my pro&s;pects are enveloped in ten fold mi&s;ery, and every &s;tep I take, renders them darker and more perplexing; the ab&s;olute
<PB N="114" REF="039134_0110_1013B08B1F75E8C8">
uncertainty I am in, at pre&s;ent, forbids my antici|pating; but I own that hope, even now throws a ray of light upon them. I wi&s;h it could be extended to you, and I think if you catch on|ly one gleam of &s;o delightful a &s;oother, you ought to encourage it. You are, indeed, he &s;igh|ed, a delightful &s;oother, but it is dangerous to be with you. I ought before this, &s;aid JULIA, in|terrupting him, to have put an end to this vi&s;it, and I thank you for &s;o timely an intimation, and a&s;&s;ure you that the plea&s;ure of &s;ocial and friendly conver&s;ation, has &s;o relieved my mind, that I for|got I was acting with impropriety. Do not wre&s;t what I &s;aid, he cried, to &s;uch a meaning, and per|mit a longer &s;tay; for the moment, I quit you, I become a prey to gloomy doubts, and dark de|&s;pair. Indeed, &s;aid the gentle girl, were I to fol|low only my inclination, your reque&s;t would be granted; but, it is time for you to go, and I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it: She looked upon her watch, it was near twelve, you will carry my be&s;t wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s and tranquility. Good night, he &s;aid, as he opened the door; you have taught me what it is to be virtuous, and to be mi&s;erable. Virtue and mi&s;ery cannot long dwell together, &s;he ob&s;erved, as &s;he bade him good night. He re|peated the wi&s;h; the door was now lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ked upon her, and &s;he retired to re&s;t; and the plea&s;ure &s;he realized in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having made a &s;ac|rifice to honor, was &s;o tranquil, that a balmy &s;leep &s;oon bound her cares in a &s;weet oblivion.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of three weeks &s;he underwent &s;e|veral examinations, which all terminated as tho&s;e already narrated, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of the&s;e, &s;he was told

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is now time to return to the Villa de Launa. When the Marquis returned from his ride, he was met by the &s;ervants who informed him of the departure of JULIA, and in a very incoherent manner, gave him a detail of that event, &s;tupified by his information, it was with difficulty he reached his &s;i&s;ter's apartment, who could only confirm what he had already heard. Though as much &s;hocked and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as the Counte&s;s, he endeavored to &s;ooth her by every argument that he could make u&s;e of, and a&s;&s;urances that every thing &s;hould be done, to relea&s;e and re&s;tore her to them.</P>
<P>Early the next morning they &s;et off for Paris, and as &s;oon as they arrived at that city, the Mar|quis applied to the king; LOUIS received him with conde&s;cen&s;ion and affability, the unfortu|nate Monarch, who has &s;ince drank the cup of affliction to the very dregs, had ju&s;t began to ex|perience the &s;orrows that &s;howered &s;o thick about him; his heart was open to the woes of others, and he wi&s;hed for nothing more than to &s;ee his people happy; but he could give the Marquis little information, and referred him to the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador; upon waiting at his
<PB N="117" REF="039134_0113_1013B095AE31DDE0">
Hotel, he was told, he was gone to pa&s;s a week with a friend in the country. The next morning he appointed to follow him, but the exerci&s;es of his mind and per&s;onal fatigue, had brought on a fit of the gout, which fell immediately on his &s;tomach, and confined him to his bed. The Counte&s;s, who loved her brother, and &s;huddered at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; idea of his death, could not leave him for a moment; but though her anxiety for JULIA, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;u&s;pended by this new af|fliction, yet &s;he was not for one moment forgot|ten. Six days after his fir&s;t attack, &s;he received a vi&s;it from Madam GYRON, who had but ju&s;t heard of her being at Paris. As &s;oon as the Counte&s;s informed her of the cau&s;e of her jour|ney, and of her &s;u&s;pence and unea&s;ine&s;s for JULIA, that lady with all the warmth of true friend&s;hip, offered to go her&s;elf to the Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador's, and learn the cau&s;e of JULIA's arre&s;t; &s;he &s;aid he was a relation of her's, and would, &s;he knew, deny her nothing.</P>
<P>She &s;et off that very day for the country, and when arrived, heard &s;ome things of real import|ance to her&s;elf. Confu&s;ed and agitated, &s;he re|turned to Paris, wrote an un&s;ati&s;factory note to the Counte&s;s who was &s;till confined to her brother's bed-&s;ide; was pre&s;ent at the nuptials of a young lady &s;he had educated, and a young man &s;he had adopted as her &s;on; got the depo&s;i|tions of &s;ome per&s;ons of re&s;pectability; and then, with the new married pair, &s;et out for Spain, bearing letters from the Counte&s;s, accounting for the non-fulfillment of her promi&s;e, and fully fraught with love and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="039134_0114_1013B09730D99998">
We now return to JULIA, who the evening preceding her appearance at Court, found her mind much agitated beyond its u&s;ual habit; &s;he could not &s;leep, and aro&s;e early the next morning, that &s;he might be ready when called for; &s;he at|tired her&s;elf in a &s;imple white robe, a &s;mall cap, placed after the manner of the country, upon the top of her head, was her only borrowed orna|ment. But her &s;oft and luxuriant hair, of the brighte&s;t auburn, curled in a thou&s;and natural but becoming ringlets, would have ornamented a face le&s;s beautiful than her own, which did not need the aids, which le&s;s hand&s;ome females find &s;o nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock, &s;he was &s;ummoned to attend, and with a palpitating heart, obeyed the &s;ummons. The Court had not long been &s;eated, the council upon both &s;ides convened; the concour&s;e was great; when attended by a thou&s;and graces, with an air at once humble and maje&s;tic, JULIA made her appearance; in&s;tantly the eyes of all were fixed upon her, and a murmur of applau&s;e ran through the building: She was led in by the jailer, and ANET was by her &s;ide; her appear|ance operated like a charm; even the Judges viewed her with partiality, and the Council, for the defendant, hoped every thing, from an ap|pearance &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. It is now time to di&s;|clo&s;e the cau&s;e of her arre&s;t, and her my&s;terious confinement.</P>
<P>Seignior DON PEDRO, a Spani&s;h gentleman, had died of grief, for the lo&s;s of an amiable wife; he had left an only child, a daughter, to the care of his brother, DON GASPERD, and by his will,
<PB N="119" REF="039134_0115_1013B098B2CD7670">
bequeathed his whole e&s;tate to that brother, if his infant daughter &s;hould die before &s;he attained the age of one and twenty; but if &s;he lived until then, her fortune was to be at her own di&s;po&s;al. The child was brought home to her uncle's hou&s;e, but being &s;eized with indi&s;po&s;ition, was carried into the country, with her nur&s;e, about &s;ix months after the death of her father; from that time &s;he had never been &s;een, and when in|quiries were made for her, an&s;wer was given, that &s;he was in a Convent for her education; doubts had ari&s;en in the minds of many; the uncle had been unhappy and gloomy; but about three months previous to the arre&s;t of JULIA, the brother of the child's mother had returned from the Ea&s;t-Indies, and immediately demanded his Niece; DON GASPERD at fir&s;t equivocated, then &s;aid &s;he was dead, but being unable to prove this, declared &s;he had been &s;tolen by her nur&s;e, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, for the &s;ake of &s;ome valuable trinkets, which &s;he had about her; that he had u&s;ed every expedient, tho' &s;ecretly, to di&s;cover her; he could never find her. The newly re|turned uncle, who had loved his &s;i&s;ter with ex|treme tenderne&s;s, immediately &s;uppo&s;ed that her life had been &s;acrificed to &s;ecure her fortune, and directly commenced a pro&s;ecution again&s;t him, as the murderer of his &s;i&s;ter's child; this hap|pened ju&s;t before the Italian nobleman (who had long known DON GASPERD, and who entertain|ed no doubts of his innocence, vi&s;ited France; he there &s;aw at the Villa DE LAUNA, JULIA, and hearing her &s;tory, immediately &s;uppo&s;ed he had found DON GASPERD'S neice; with this news,
<PB N="120" REF="039134_0116_1013B09A3672C438">
he &s;at off for Spain, and an edict to &s;ummon her to appear, was made out, but her maternal uncle, DON ELZIVER &s;uppo&s;ing this all a deception, and burning to revenge the murder of his niece, got an order from the King to the Amba&s;&s;ador, for JULIA to be arre&s;ted as a culprit, and that &s;ecrecy &s;hould be more &s;trictly adhered to, pledged him&s;elf in an oath, and had the &s;ame admini&s;ter|ed to CARLOS, the amiable &s;on of DON GAS|PERD, that &s;he &s;hould not be informed of the cau&s;e of her confinement, till &s;he appeared before the Judges. Notwith&s;tanding the prejudice he cheri&s;hed, and which had convinced him, &s;he was an impo&s;tor; he was charmed with her beau|ty, maje&s;ty, and innocence; her good &s;en&s;e and artle&s;s, tho' brilliant remarks, he could not help admiring; and her extreme frankne&s;s, almo&s;t con|vinced him, that if &s;he was a deceiver, &s;he her|&s;elf was deceived; and tho' he wi&s;hed to relea&s;e her mind, he had &s;trictly adherd to the oath he had taken, while CARLOS had lo&s;t his rea&s;on, in his admiration of her beauty and pity of her &s;uf|ferings.</P>
<P>In this augu&s;t Court, before thou&s;ands of &s;pec|tators, before the opening of the cau&s;e, JULIA was informed of the&s;e particulars; and tho' &s;he could not prove that &s;he was not the neice, or any ways connected with her, yet a pre-&s;entiment, per&s;uaded her, that &s;he was not; &s;he had under|went a &s;trict examination, previous to the infor|mation; the clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion of her an&s;|wers, and her artle&s;s manner, and her own re|marks, had convinced all, that &s;he was no impo&s;|tor. After this nece&s;&s;ary delay, the trial went on,
<PB N="121" REF="039134_0117_1013B09F2BBA1F50">
and the Coun&s;el on both &s;ides di&s;played talents and abilities, that could not &s;ail to plea&s;e lovers of eloquence, although the &s;ubterfuges that they made u&s;e of, &s;truck the innocent heart of JULIA, with di&s;gu&s;t. Several gentlemen, with true Span|i&s;h gallantry, pre&s;&s;ed forward to &s;upport and at|tend JULIA, who had no friend near her; (CAR|LOS being too much intere&s;ted to witne&s;s a deci|&s;ion, upon which the life of his father depended;) &s;he was indulged with a &s;eat, and her counten|ance betrayed the various agitations of her mind.</P>
<P>The advocate for the pro&s;ecutor, endeavored to prove, that JULIA was an impo&s;tor; that the real neice of DON GASPERD was murdered; they brought forward the perturbated &s;tate of his mind; imputed his gloom to guilt; and expati|ated upon his avarice, upon his equivocating with Don ELZIVER, of the fal&s;hoods he had told him, and the many &s;hifts he had made u&s;e of, to get rid of this affair; and now, &s;aid one, he has found a needy adventurer, and has compromi&s;ed the matter with her; and is willing to give up the fortune of the poor murdered orphan, rather than his own life.</P>
<P>JULIA, could hardly refrain from &s;peaking, but her indignation &s;parkled in her eyes, and was flu&s;hed upon every feature of her face.</P>
<P>When it was time for the advocate upon the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to &s;peak, he plead forcibly in behalf of his client, and endeavored to prove him inno|cent of the crime alledged to him; when near the clo&s;e of his defence, he produced evidence to prove, that JULIA was under the protection of the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA, treated by her as a
<PB N="122" REF="039134_0118_1013B0A214EADFA8">
daughter; by the Marquis as a child, and entit|led by the will of both to an hundred thou&s;and crowns; is it likely (&s;aid he) that &s;o noble, &s;o ex|alted a female, as the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA, would become an accomplice in &s;o dark an affair? Is it likely that the Marquis ALVADA would abet any one in a &s;cheme, to rob a man of his right, or to protect his murderer? But, &s;aid he, we have in the face of this lady, the faire&s;t and mo&s;t convincing proof of her innocence, (and he threw up the gauze veil that &s;haded, but could not conceal her beauty,) look at her, added he, and &s;ay if &s;he can be guilty; does not innocence and every virtue appear in every feature; and appeal to every feeling heart, again&s;t the inju&s;tice done her? Does not the varying crim&s;on tell you, how great is her indignation at this in&s;ult, and how much her &s;oul would recoil at the idea of deception? I will not &s;ay that JULIA VALLACE is niece to Don GASPERD, but I will undertake to prove that &s;he is no impo&s;tor; he then endeav|ored to touch the feelings of all, by repre&s;enting in terms pathetic, the crime of injuring beauty and innocence; when unprotected by wealth or power; the horror of condemning a man upon any, but the mo&s;t po&s;itive proofs, and the mi&s;ery that would be de&s;erved and endured, if Don GASPERD &s;hould be condemned and &s;uffer, and in any future period found innocent. The judges inquired, if JULIA had no one of the jewels about her, for which the infant had been &s;up|po&s;ed to be &s;tolen; the uncle &s;aid that among&s;t them was a miniature of her mother, and that &s;he had a mark upon her arm occa&s;ioned by a burn.
<PB N="123" REF="039134_0119_1013B0A39FE38B30">
Upon inquiry, JULIA owned &s;he had worn a pic|ture, that &s;he had always &s;uppo&s;ed to be her mo|ther's, but by the direction of the per&s;on from whom &s;he received it, had kept it out of &s;ight; &s;he produced it, &s;ome per&s;ons declared it to be the picture of DONNA ELVIRA, but mo&s;t of tho&s;e who remembered that lady, thought it was not; they remarked that the eyes of DONNA ELVIRA were black, tho&s;e of the miniature a &s;oft blue; the features and colour of the picture were rather mild, than &s;triking; they were rich and delicate; a pen&s;ivene&s;s &s;eemed &s;pread over them while, DON|NA ELVIRA was &s;parkling, and to &s;ome had the appearance of boldne&s;s, JULIA was remarked by all to re&s;emble the portrait; but DONNA ELVI|RA, was different, though lovely. The picture was returned, and with a dignified mode&s;ty, &s;he replaced it in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>She was next que&s;tioned re&s;pecting the mark, and when the glove was pulled from her &s;oft white arm, it was apparent to all. This was regarded as an unequivocal proof; but &s;ome of the judges wi&s;hed to defer a deci&s;ion, till the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA could appear, but the parties and populace pre&s;&s;ed &s;o loudly for an immediate ver|dict, that they became decided in favor of Don GASPERD, and he was &s;olemnly acquitted; and JULIA acknowledged as his niece, and the heire&s;s of his brother's fortune.</P>
<P>Congratulations flew around the Court; Don GASPERD thanked the judges, and CARLOS who was informed of the happy i&s;&s;ue of this dreaded trial, half breathle&s;s with joy ru&s;hed into the Court, and with frantic emotions embraced his

<P>How difficult is it, my deare&s;t JULIA, for the heart which within a very few days has vibrated with plea&s;ure, &s;unk with horror, and throbbed with gratitude, to expre&s;s a tender and pure affection to the be&s;t and deare&s;t of women! How very different, to clothe its &s;en&s;ations, in language, that can be plea&s;ing to her affectionate bo&s;om, and not unacceptable to her delicacy? but while I write, &s;uch a croud of contending emotions,
<PB N="130" REF="039134_0126_1013B0B6CD6CC098">
pre&s;s upon my mind, that I know not how, to pre&s;erve con&s;i&s;tence, or method, in this letter of narrative, for &s;uch it will be; yes, my JULIA! the man whom you have honored, with your e&s;|teem; the man who triumphs in the dear idea of calling you his; the man who&s;e chief delight &s;hall be to make you happy, has &s;huddered with the fear of lo&s;ing the&s;e ine&s;timable titles; he has been in the very &s;hadow of death, and trembled upon the very verge of eternity.</P>
<Q><L>"Even then when horror froze his blood,</L>
<L>"His heart was filled with love for thee."</L></Q>
<P>And in the moment, when &s;truggling nature worn out, with a long, and arduous conte&s;t, was about to quit the wearied frame forever, the image of JULIA, was before my eves, and &s;eemed to for|bid an approaching di&s;&s;olution; it was then that I found how much dearer you were to me than life; how much dearer, than all that life contains be&s;ides you! It was in that tremendous moment, that every dear friend and beloved connexion, pre&s;&s;ed upon my recollection, that a multitude of &s;ins pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my view, and but for the idea of a SAVIOUR, would have added to the dreadful &s;cene, terrors too di&s;tracting to have been &s;upported with rea&s;on; but I ca&s;t them upon him, who is willing to &s;ave; and even then a bright gleam of hope, illuminated the dreary pro&s;pect, and pointed to a futurity, where no &s;torm &s;hall di&s;turb the calm, of everla&s;ting hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>But, I am forgetting, that you are &s;till unac|quainted with the cau&s;e, of the&s;e reflections; in|deed

I am &s;ometimes &s;o lo&s;t, to the di&s;tance that is between us, and &s;o plea&s;ed to recollect the cord that &s;o &s;trongly drew us together, and en|twined a mutual affection, from the day of our fir&s;t acquaintance, that I feel as though every tran&s;action of each mu&s;t be known to each other, and often in my mind's eye, behold the fair form of my JULIA, and look to &s;ee if an approving &s;mile irradiates her charming countenance; it is then, that the &s;oft delu&s;ion; the flattering dream cea&s;es to deceive me, and reality, &s;ad reality, places three thou&s;and long, long miles, between us; but neither time, nor di&s;tance, can irradicate the tender and &s;trong attachment, that your virtues have impre&s;&s;ed upon my heart, for it has &s;tood the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t of death, and even the gloomy tyrant had not the power of era&s;ing your image, from a bo|&s;om that is intirely filled with you. But let me leave this effu&s;ion of affection; this tide of tender|ne&s;s, let me re&s;train; and proceed to inform you of the events which have brought me to Virginia, and thrown me into the care and protection of the Hero of America; the boa&s;t of New-England; the dread of her enemies, and the &s;age, patriot, and illu&s;trious farmer of Mount Vernon.</P>
<P>Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to procure a pa&s;&s;age from Hollowel, to either France or Great-Britain, I found &s;ome difficulty in per&s;uading my poor un|fortunate cou&s;in, to leave a place where &s;he had received a thou&s;and attentions, and kindne&s;&s;es, from the inhabitants, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every &s;ocial and ho&s;pitable virtue, for Bo&s;ton, which had been the &s;cene of her mo&s;t &s;evere afflictions. She was greatly altered, and wi&s;hed not to a&s;&s;oci|ate with the gay, or the great; indeed &s;he wi&s;hed
<PB N="132" REF="039134_0128_1013B0BC6CE06358">
to be &s;ecreted from all the world, till in the arms of her parents, her faults and &s;orrows were forgot|ten. She yeilded to nece&s;&s;ity, and my entreaties; and with her lovely infant accompanied me, to Bo&s;ton; a pa&s;&s;age &s;oon pre&s;ented, and we em|barked on board the two Friends, bound for London, on the tenth of this month. The &s;hip was large and convenient, and every comfort, was procured, that could render the voyage agree|able, to my fair companion, and her infant charge; for the fir&s;t day the wind was fre&s;h and favorable, but upon the next, it changed, and our cour&s;e was altered: it continued unfavorable, without any violence, until the twentieth, or ra|ther the night of the nineteenth, when a dreadful &s;torm commenced, with a violence that a&s;toni&s;h|ed our able&s;t &s;eamen; until twelve o'clock, of the &s;ucceeding day, our ve&s;&s;el &s;tood its heavie&s;t &s;hocks, and the ri&s;ing billows &s;eemed not to affect her tall ma&s;ts and hardy &s;ides; but then we &s;truck again&s;t a &s;unken rock, and with a mo&s;t tremendous noi&s;e, both main and forema&s;t come upon the deck, and were levelled with the ocean.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to paint, the horrors of our &s;ituation; the water now poured into the &s;ides of the &s;hip, with a dreadful roar, and &s;peedy di&s;|&s;olution, &s;tared us in the face; in this &s;tate our &s;hip fixed firmly to the rock; every heart &s;eemed to &s;ink; and as the la&s;t re&s;ource, the long boat was got out, and it was unanimou&s;ly agreed to leave the ve&s;&s;el, which in a very few hours mu&s;t go to pieces: it was then I had a proof of the &s;trong effects of maternal affection, no per&s;ua&s;ion could prevail upon my cou&s;in, to tru&s;t her child in

the arms of any one, but her&s;elf; her maid had before cro&s;&s;ed the atlantic; and to the honor of woman, be it &s;poken, acted with as much pre|&s;ence of mind, as the olde&s;t &s;eaman on board; but not for one moment would &s;he tru&s;t her dar|ling with her. She held him fa&s;t, pre&s;&s;ed to her bo&s;om, and the little fellow &s;eemed to think his mother, his be&s;t protector, for he hung around her neck, and hid his little face upon her &s;houl|der, while her fears &s;eemed only for him. In this &s;tate, while every &s;ea da&s;hed over us, and every other moment buried us beneath a wave; with the utmo&s;t difficulty we got her into the boat, and while I was preparing to follow, a billow foam|ing with redoubled fury, parted it from the &s;hip, and left me behind. It was not without the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing emotions, I &s;aw it borne aloft upon the top of the &s;urge, and anon, overwhelmed in the &s;ea. I was the only one left upon the wreck, as my &s;ervant had taken upon him&s;elf the care of MARY, who was in the boat before, her lady. For &s;ome time I followed it with my eyes, and &s;aw it buffeting the &s;torm, when I beheld a man plung|ing into the ocean, and &s;wim towards the wreck. Judge what was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when I found this to be the faithful fellow, who had attended me, as a &s;ervant, and finding I was not with the crew, cho&s;e rather to &s;hare the fate of his ma&s;ter, than &s;eek &s;afety without him. He was an able &s;wimmer, and &s;oon reached the ve&s;&s;el, which he entered with more apparent plea&s;ure, than he had left it; my heart was melted at this proof of his affection; and he immediately propo&s;ed to get the &s;mall boat out, and try, if in that, we could
<PB N="134" REF="039134_0130_1013B0C1B2936728">
not reach the &s;hore, which we now &s;aw within a few miles; with amazing exertion, we at la&s;t &s;ucceeded, and having got the boat into the &s;ea, jumped into her, and in le&s;s than a minute the &s;hip parted in the middle, and di&s;appeared from our view; we now endeavored to row to land; but our hands were benumbed with cold, and we were too feeble to go at any great rate; however we were within one half mile of it, when a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ave overturned our &s;mall boat, and we were thrown into the &s;ea! It was here, that death in its mo&s;t dreadful &s;hape, pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my view; but in a few moments, my &s;en&s;es were lo&s;t, and even JULIA, was &s;hut out from my imagination. I cannot de&s;cribe as I ought the &s;ucceeding &s;cenes, and therefore will pa&s;s them by. When I came to my&s;elf, I found I was &s;urrounded by negroes, who were doing all in their power to recall the vital &s;park, which &s;eemed totally ex|tingui&s;hed. Before I could open my eyes, to be|hold the&s;e &s;ooty &s;ons of Africa, the fair vi&s;ion of my beloved JULIA, flitted before my imagination, and revived my fleeting &s;pirits. My bodily pains were exqui&s;ite, nor was my mind compo&s;ed. It was &s;ometime before I could conceive of my &s;itua|tion, and I had &s;tared around with vacant, but a&s;|toni&s;hed looks, upon the &s;urrounding objects, when the plaintive voice of my cou&s;in, caught my attention; &s;he was in terms quite incoherent; la|menting my fate, and blaming her&s;elf as the au|thor of my death. But when &s;he &s;aw that I was alive, her joy became almo&s;t frantic, and I found by her frequent addre&s;&s;es to her boy, that his life was pre&s;erved. Gratitude taught me to enquire
<PB N="135" REF="039134_0131_1013B0C46351CB38">
for my &s;ervant, as &s;oon as I could u&s;e my voice, and my cou&s;in told me, he was ju&s;t recovering his recollection in an adjoining hut. She then informed me, the crew in the long boat, had got &s;ale on &s;hore, and that we all owed our lives to the ho&s;pitality of the&s;e Negroes. I never had entertained that narrow prejudice, that affects &s;ome people, that a dark &s;kin, cannot cover a fair heart. It is the complexion of the mind that &s;tamps the man, a wretch or an hero; but &s;till I was &s;urpri&s;ed, at the kindne&s;s and attention of the&s;e &s;laves. Upon enquiry, I found we were upon the e&s;tate of the be&s;t and great|e&s;t man, in the world; and that the&s;e kind pro|tectors were the &s;ervants, or rather humble friends, of the Illu&s;trious WASHINGTON; from him they had learnt to follow the dictates of humanity, to obey the impul&s;e of benevolence, and to tread the broad paths of philanthropy. See, my deare&s;t JULIA what the example of the great and truly noble, may do; the&s;e people are in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with all civilzed nations; the love of &s;elf pre&s;ervation teaches them &s;o to be; in gene|ral, more at variance, with their ma&s;ters, than with any others; nor is this to be wondered at; for their ma&s;ters are their tyrants. Yet behold them here performing every kind office; nor is this &s;urpri&s;ing, they are the &s;ervants of WASH|INGTON; this wonderful man has made them happy, and learns them to make others &s;o. Oh, my JULIA could the limits of a letter permit it, I could tell thee &s;uch things of this man; could paint his dome&s;tic virtues, in &s;uch a light; and inform thee of the thou&s;and acts of virtue and
<PB N="136" REF="039134_0132_1013B0C846A10198">
benevolence, as would fill thy gentle bo&s;om with &s;urprize and plea&s;ure; but it is what this con|veyance will not permit; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, we are at pre&s;ent fo&s;tered in the bo&s;om of this virtuous and noble family, who&s;e revered chief, is my pro|tector, friend, and benefactor; he has put it in my power, to pro&s;ecute my voyage; and as &s;oon as my cou&s;in is &s;ufficiently recruited, we &s;hall proceed from here to Philadelphia, and then take pa&s;&s;age for London; and I hope by the permi&s;|&s;ion of Providence, to be with my deare&s;t JULIA by the fir&s;t of June, there to claim the promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing; and receive the riche&s;t pre&s;ent, heaven in its indulgence, could be&s;tow. I &s;hall not com|ment upon the dangers I have e&s;caped, nor the mercies I have received; but tru&s;t your own feelings for a copy of my reflections; adieu my JULIA, join your prayers with mine, that the life of the be&s;t of men, may long be &s;pared to his revering country, and his excellent family, and to add to the happine&s;s of JULIA, and her,</P>

<P>Before the reading of her letters, JULIA, had retired, to a magnificent apartment, that was by Madam GYRON's direction, prepared for her; and joy in tumultuous tides ru&s;hed upon her mind, &s;o as to deprive her, when &s;he reflected upon the events of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> momentous day, which had decided upon the fate of &s;o many; which had unveiled &s;cenes &s;o uncommon, and in which for|tune had &s;o often &s;hifted; &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to clo&s;e her eyes, until midnight, when a balmy &s;lumber, &s;ealed in forgetfulne&s;s, its tran&s;actions.</P>

<P>Upon joining her friends below, &s;he found CARLOS with them, who&s;e impa&s;&s;ioned looks declared, how tender his feelings towards her were, he made the mo&s;t affectionate inquiries for her health, and upon bearing her re&s;olution, joined Madam GYRON and her &s;on and daughter, in per&s;uading her to tarry, till &s;ome of her friends were going to France, unle&s;s &s;he would permit him to attend, which he mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hed to do; as &s;he could not be prevailed upon to accept this propo&s;al, &s;he concluded to tarry a week or two, till a gentleman and lady who called to &s;ee Madam, and who being about to travel to Paris, reque&s;ted the plea&s;ure of conducting her, to her friends.

turns, partaken of all their amu&s;ements, and for a &s;ea&s;on, entered into all their di&s;&s;ipations, but &s;he found it an ineffectual cure for a di&s;ea&s;ed mind, and &s;ought in vain for a remedy, while &s;he nur&s;ed that deadly pa&s;&s;ion, and bore about her all the di&s;tem|pered malice, of indignant reputation and lo&s;t hon|our. She was wealthy, and her liberality gave her friends and flatterers; her talents and her accom|pli&s;hments had procured her both admirers and en|emies; but her temper was &s;oured by ill-treatment, and di&s;appointed love; and &s;he was at times &s;o capricious, as to quarrel with tho&s;e &s;he loved be&s;t. This unhappy propen&s;ity involved her in many difficulties, and in the mid&s;t of her chagrin, &s;he &s;ometimes &s;ought in &s;olitude, a relief, that &s;ocie|ty could not give her.</P>
<P>Solitude, is indeed a relief, to a wounded &s;pirit; it is a balm, to a di&s;tempered mind; but it is in&s;ufficient to tho&s;e, who cheri&s;h an unfor|giving temper; for in &s;olitude, we look in upon our|&s;elves, and we cannot forgive the injuries we re|ceive. The inve&s;tigation mu&s;t di&s;tre&s;s us, and we turn from a retro&s;pect &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting. As for Madam GYRON, &s;he had never found a wi&s;h to forgive Don GASPERD, and of con&s;equence, tho&s;e retirements that gave lei&s;ure and time for reflec|tion, convinced her it was her duty to forgive him, had become irk&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting to her; to have heard of his death, would have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her, if death had approached in the natural way; for to &s;uch an height was her thir&s;t of vengeance carried, that &s;he &s;ometimes enjoyed in idea, the plea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould receive, in being the princi|pal agent, to inflict an ignominious death. It was
<PB N="139" REF="039134_0135_1013B0CE022BB5B8">
in vain for &s;uch a mind, to &s;eek for peace; &s;he fir&s;t began to feel compunction, when &s;he return|ed to France, and beheld her &s;on amiable and ac|compli&s;hed; &s;he then contemplated his marriage with Don GASPERD's niece, who was truly lovely. She almo&s;t forgot her &s;cheme of vengeance, and hearing at that time, he was really under arre&s;t, and that JULIA was likewi&s;e implicated in that affair; &s;he formed a re&s;olution of going directly to Spain, and laid a plan of proceedings which &s;he put in execution, as has been already narrated.</P>
<P>She had now acknowledged her crime; made all the reparation in her power; a perfect recon|ciliation had taken place; her mind was freed from the &s;ting of a wounded con&s;cience; from intended iniquity; her temper &s;weetened; and in the &s;ociety of her amiable &s;on, and daughter, &s;he forgot &s;he had ever been injured. Or being &s;o, cea&s;ed to think of it; her natural cheerfulne&s;s returned. Her unbounded wealth, put it in her power to gratify every whim, and &s;he now di&s;|played her ta&s;te and elegance, by magnificent balls, and entertainments, in honour of the newly married pair. In the&s;e, &s;he imitated the fa&s;hion of almo&s;t every court in Europe; balls, operas, ma&s;querades, and routs, at which all the nobility and gentry at M&mdash;, were invited, with all the &s;trangers of fa&s;hion; and the Spaniards for a while forgot their &s;tately gravity, and mingled in the motley dance of the &s;prightly Frenchman, and li&s;tened to the &s;oft mu&s;ic of the enervated Italian.</P>
<P>JULIA was obliged to partake in all the&s;e di&s;&s;ipating &s;cenes; &s;he was followed, flattered, and
<PB N="140" REF="039134_0136_1013B0D317675D10">
care&s;&s;ed; and indeed her per&s;on was &s;o lovely as to attract univer&s;al attention; while the &s;weet|ne&s;s of her manners and affability, gained her the love and admiration of all; though her cheer|fulne&s;s charmed every heart, her perfect prudence, and innate delicacy, &s;eemed to repel every impro|priety; and her admirers, declared that the &s;en&s;a|tions &s;he created, were &s;uch a mixture of re&s;pect, love, e&s;teem, and friend&s;hip, that they had never been &s;en&s;ible of before.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the novelty of every thing carried a charm that could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail to delight her; but they would not bear repeating; they palled upon reflection, and &s;he &s;oon grew &s;ick of this contin|ual round of amu&s;ement, where not one moment was given to thought; and reflection was ban|i&s;hed, by gaiety; and &s;he longed for the quiet &s;cenes of the Villa, where &s;entiment gave a ze&s;t to every enjoyment; and virtuous and rational amu&s;ements, rendered every &s;cene plea&s;ant, re|fined, and in&s;tructive. She &s;ighed for the &s;ociety of her benefactre&s;s, and longed again to attend the venerable Marquis; &s;he &s;aw much company, but found little &s;ociety; &s;he gained many ac|quaintance, but her heart &s;ickened for the ble&s;&s;|ing of friend&s;hip; &s;he was introduced with ecla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, to a great deal of the gay world; but &s;he found, but little &s;ub&s;tantial enjoyment; and after a day &s;pent in gaiety, and what is u&s;ually termed plea&s;ure, &s;he retired with regret, to her own apartment, affrighted upon reflection, that &s;he could recol|lect no prai&s;eworthy action, or u&s;eful pur&s;uit. There &s;he always found ANNET, who recollected that Madamoi&s;elle had lo&s;t much of her color,
<PB N="141" REF="039134_0137_1013B0D5D2EC3918">
and was thinner, then &s;he had been at the Villa.</P>
<P>With Donna ELVIRA, &s;he had but a few lei&s;ure moments. That lady was indeed amiable, but &s;he had ju&s;t e&s;caped from a convent, to enjoy all that love, wealth, and rank could be&s;tow. She loved her hu&s;band, and his mother; &s;he found the world as gay as &s;he wi&s;hed it, and as happy; every one was intere&s;ted for her, and &s;he was inter|e&s;ted by every thing. She had been u&s;hered into life, in too extraordinary a manner, not to engage the attention of all, upon fir&s;t fight; and &s;he went from one &s;cene to another, with a&s;toni&s;hing avidity.</P>
<P>Her hu&s;band, who had made the tour of Eu|rope, and was well acquainted with the world, was plea&s;ed with &s;o new a character, and as he loved her, likewi&s;e loved to gratify all her wi&s;hes, but he did not then &s;ee, the danger to which a lovely, young, unexperienced woman, is expo&s;ed; indeed he was really good, and had but very little of the Spaniard, in him; yet he &s;ome|times looked beyond the pre&s;ent, trifling period; and with &s;ome degree of impatience, contemplat|ed a &s;cheme of retirement, and &s;ighed for a more rational life.</P>
<P>CARLOS was the only one, except this gentle|man, in whos&s;e &s;ociety JULIA, could really take plea&s;ure; their good &s;en&s;e, and exten&s;ive know|ledge, was a fund of information, and gave her much &s;atisfaction; for CARLOS, &s;he felt a kind of fraternal friend&s;hip. He was amiable, and wor|thy of it; but &s;he feared to indulge the &s;ocial intercour&s;e, that true friend&s;hip requires; for not|with&s;tanding, the pains he took to &s;uppre&s;s his feelings, &s;he &s;aw that he loved her, with enthu&s;ia&s;|tic
<PB N="142" REF="039134_0138_1013B0D754BC2AA0">
pa&s;&s;ion; but in the hu&s;band of Donna ELVI|RA, &s;he found a friend, who e&s;teemed her per&s;on; revered her virtues; admired her talents, and up|on who&s;e advice &s;he could depend.</P>
<P>Two weeks, and double that time had elap&s;ed, and &s;till &s;he waited for her companions; &s;he grew every day more impatient, to return, and when at the end of another week, &s;he was informed that they would &s;et out in three days, &s;he was tran&s;|ported with joy.</P>
<P>Madam GYRON, who loved her fair gue&s;t, determined to give a ma&s;ked ball, as a particular compliment before her departure. It was to be after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion, and cards of invitation, were di&s;tributed to all her acquaintance.</P>
<P>JULIA, had from her earlie&s;t infancy, accu&s;|tomed her&s;elf to do that which her con&s;cience would approve; however &s;he might be per&s;uad|ed to the contrary. She had an innate and live|ly &s;en&s;e of female propriety, and never had &s;he once deviated from it. She had always thought it, highly incon&s;i&s;tent, with the true dignity of a young woman, to appear in a borrowed character. For this rea&s;on, &s;he refu&s;ed any garb, that would di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf; or for one moment mi&s;lead ano|ther. Madam GYRON, per&s;uaded in vain, and her eloquence was all lo&s;t, upon her fair inflexible. I cannot, my dear Madam, &s;aid &s;he; indeed I cannot act in a character, that providence has not given me; it has placed me in a very humble &s;tation; it has alloted me a very plain and ea&s;y part; it is my duty to perform it well; nor will I militate again&s;t its decree, by taking one that is not a&s;&s;igned me. You are very humble indeed,
<PB N="143" REF="039134_0139_1013B0DA0D896C70">
my dear, (replied Madam,) but &s;urely your mod|e&s;ty and humility, will not be offended at the dre&s;s and character of a nun. But (cried JULIA,) nei|ther my con&s;cience, or inclination, would permit me to be a reclu&s;e; I mu&s;t refu&s;e, and beg you will no longer per&s;uade me. But indeed, I &s;hall be a queen then; what a&s;&s;ume the appearance of royalty! My mo&s;t ambitious thoughts never a&s;|pired to it, for one moment. Strange girl, (cried Madam,) be a &s;hepherde&s;s then. Not by any means, Madam, I do not a&s;pire to be above my|&s;elf; and I do not mean to de&s;cend. You &s;hould remember, my dear JULIA, that you are the friend and companion of the Counte&s;s DE LAU|NA, and by appearing with propriety, you do hon|our to her election, and attachment; but if you do not, you di&s;grace her choice. I am per&s;uaded, returned JULIA, very &s;eriou&s;ly, that my pre&s;ent conduct would meet with her approbation; I &s;hall dre&s;s in a manner much above my&s;elf; be|cau&s;e I will &s;hew the world, I glory in being her dependent; that I am indebted to her, not only for the conveniencies of life, but for its elegancies: But after all, I will not forget, that I am a hum|ble cottage girl; and the child of her bounty; is the plain, and &s;imple JULIA VALLACE. But I am &s;ure, replied Madam, that the Counte&s;s would not have your appearance &s;o &s;ingular, as to occa&s;ion remarks. I know my dear Madam, not|with&s;tanding your kindne&s;s, (&s;aid JULIA,) that I am really too in&s;ignificant, to attract much at|tention, if my conduct is incon&s;i&s;tent with the ettiquette of the place, it will be attributed to ignorance, and in a few days at farthe&s;t forgotten;
<PB N="144" REF="039134_0140_1013B0DDE03698E8">
but if I did that, which I was con&s;cious was wrong, I am &s;ure the &s;en&s;e of it would hurt me for many years, and embitter &s;ome of my plea|&s;ante&s;t moments. Well then, replied Madam, take your own way; for I find you will not adopt mine. Pray, my dear Madam, (&s;aid JULIA,) do not be offended, nor impute my refu&s;al to ob&s;ti|nacy; there are few things, I would not do to oblige you; I mu&s;t ever feel under a thou&s;and obligations, that I can never return to you; and I hate the appearance of ingratitude. Tell me that you are not angry with me. Embracing her with affection, Madam a&s;&s;ured her, &s;he did not think it po&s;&s;ible, for any one to be offended with her: I have but one fault, to find with you, &s;aid &s;he, you are too good, and too &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; I wi&s;h you were not half &s;o faultle&s;s. JULIA ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and went to her chamber, where &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in a &s;tile of elegance, &s;uperior to what &s;he had ever worn.</P>
<P>The rooms were hardly opened, before &s;he found her&s;elf &s;urrounded, by characters of all de&s;|criptions; from the king to the link boy; from the queen, to the opera girl; Dutche&s;es, and no&s;e|gay women; nur&s;es, and women of ea&s;y virtue; bi&s;hops and &s;ailors; and in general, &s;he could not help ob&s;erving, that people a&s;&s;umed tho&s;e charac|ters they like be&s;t, and in which they are the lea&s;t likely to &s;hine, as they were mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e which providence had a&s;&s;igned them. She &s;oon di&s;covered CARLOS, who&s;e impa&s;&s;ioned voice, the moment he addre&s;&s;ed her, rendered his ma&s;k an in&s;ufficient di&s;gui&s;e. At fir&s;t, &s;he was plea&s;ed with the motley &s;cene, and the remarks
<PB N="145" REF="039134_0141_1013B0E08981D298">
&s;he made to CARLOS, declared her plea&s;ure, and told at the &s;ame time, how &s;oon it tired.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the company were &s;ummoned to &s;up|per, a tall ma&s;k offered to tell her fortune; &s;he held out her hand, and de&s;ired he would exert his utmo&s;t &s;kill. I will tell you one thing, fair lady, (he &s;aid,) while he examined the &s;potle&s;s palm of JULIA, you will meet with a &s;ad di&s;appointment; the friends you mean to vi&s;it, you will not &s;ee for &s;ome time, and many is the trial, that you will go through, before you are &s;o fortunate.</P>
<P>Though JULIA had never given credit to a&s;tro|logy; though her heart revolted at &s;uper&s;tition; though &s;he knew her informer acted in a borrow|ed character; yet &s;o perver&s;e is the human heart, that &s;he felt her &s;pirits depre&s;&s;ed for a moment; the prediction ca&s;t a &s;hade upon her cheerfulne&s;s; and gave a &s;ombre tincture, to the ideas, that had before &s;prung from the gay &s;cene; which &s;ur|rounded her, and hope of more rational enjoy|ment.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, &s;he danced with CARLOS, and the company did not &s;eparate till morning; &s;he retired languid and fatigued, to her chamber; and a di&s;turbed &s;leep followed the hurry and bu&s;|tle of the night.</P>

<P>WHEN &s;he awoke from a di&s;turbed &s;lum|ber, &s;he found her&s;elf much indi&s;po&s;ed; a vio|lent head-ach, cold, &s;hivering fit, and a difficulty of breathing, declared her really &s;ick; &s;he how|ever got up, and as &s;he was to &s;et out for France, the day following; &s;he determined not to com|plain, attributing it to the fatigues of the preceding evening. She found her appetite intirely gone, and her attempts at cheerfulne&s;s and conver|&s;ation, was vain, and &s;he was obliged to retire early, and take a medicine, that her friends pre|pared for her.</P>
<P>She was &s;o determined to be well the next morning, that when &s;he aro&s;e after a &s;leeple&s;s night, &s;he per&s;uaded her&s;elf, that &s;he really was &s;o,
<PB N="147" REF="039134_0143_1013B0E38E1F72B0">
and with trembling hands, and limbs that could &s;carce &s;upport her&s;elf, &s;he put on her riding habit, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted ANNET to put up her things; and was quite ready, when Madam GYRON entered the chamber and informed her that her traveling companions were come by appointment, to break|fa&s;t with her, and would &s;et off immediately after.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty &s;he got down to the breakfa&s;t parlor; and there her altered looks were ob&s;erved by all; who united to per&s;uade her to defer her journey, for a few days longer, or at lea&s;t, till &s;he was better; &s;he a&s;&s;ured them &s;he thought the excur&s;ion, would be of &s;ervice to her, and that &s;he did not doubt &s;he &s;hould be quite well, before &s;he had been an hour in the carriage; as they &s;aw her heart was much &s;et up|on going, they did not oppo&s;e it, but after break|fa&s;t, of which &s;he did not ta&s;te, when &s;he aro&s;e to bid farewell to the friends &s;he was leaving, and attend tho&s;e with whom &s;he was going, &s;he fault|ered and &s;unk into a chair, unable to &s;upport her|&s;elf a moment longer, and was carried back to her chamber, almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of every thing a|round her.</P>
<P>The exertions of this morning, and of the pre|ceeding day, had &s;o accelerated the progre&s;s of her di&s;order, that &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible, to with|&s;tand the violence with which &s;he was attacked.</P>
<P>A phy&s;ician was immediately &s;ent for, and up|on his arrival, did not he&s;itate to declare, &s;he had taken the &s;mall pox; the eruption began to ap|pear, and &s;he grew delirious.</P>
<P>The family had before had this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o fa|tal, to female beauty; yet they were thrown in|to
<PB N="148" REF="039134_0144_1013B0E8B0780138">
to unu&s;ual con&s;ternation; the manners of JULIA had been &s;o attractive, &s;o mild, and una&s;&s;uming; her voice &s;o &s;weet, and her whole conduct &s;o gen|tle, that every dome&s;tic in Madam GYRON's hou&s;e was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at her &s;ickne&s;s, and intere&s;t|ed in her recovery. As for ANNET, unable to a&s;|&s;ume the fortitude of her mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he became al|mo&s;t di&s;tracted, and was obliged to leave an ap|partment, in which her di&s;tre&s;s, was &s;o loud, as to di&s;turb the patient.</P>
<P>Madam GYRON and her daughter never left her for a moment; the be&s;t of nur&s;es were pro|cured, and the able&s;t of the faculty con&s;ulted, and every thing done to render &s;ickne&s;s bearable; for the fir&s;t &s;even days, the poor &s;ufferer was in|&s;en&s;ible, to her pains, and her di&s;order wore an a&s;|pect, &s;o alarming, as to be pronounced mortal; but upon the eighth, it a&s;&s;umed a more favourable appearance, and came to a cri&s;is that flattered them, with hopes of the mo&s;t happy event; it was then that &s;he recovered her recollection, and knew the per&s;ons around her.</P>
<P>Madam GYRON wi&s;hed to make her &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;he had been &s;ick with a fever; but the impo|&s;ition did not take, and &s;he begged to be informed what was the nature of &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a malady. Her mind was &s;o debilitated by her &s;uffering, that it &s;hared in her corporeal weakne&s;s; and when &s;he learned &s;he had the &s;mall-pox, &s;he &s;hed &s;ome tears; but in a few hours, &s;he gathered &s;trength &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;i&s;t her fortitude, and &s;he returned fervent thanks to heaven for her returning health, and was perfectly &s;atisfied, that the intire lo&s;s of beauty, &s;hould be the con&s;equence, of her illne&s;s.
<PB N="149" REF="039134_0145_1013B0EB5A35BB68">
She recovered by &s;low degrees; the tranquillity of her &s;pirits, and patience, aided every medicine; at fir&s;t her friends &s;uppo&s;ed the ravages made in her per&s;on, would be dreadful, but were agreea|bly di&s;appointed, to find as &s;he recovered, the im|pre&s;&s;ion wore out, and before &s;he was able to leave her chamber, &s;carce a mark remained.</P>
<P>Madam GYRON, had deferred writing to the Counte&s;s, till &s;he was better, and intirely out of danger, as &s;he knew it would be impo&s;&s;ible, for her to take a journey, at that time, and &s;he wi&s;h|ed to &s;ave her from the pains of &s;u&s;pence; &s;o that the very next po&s;t after &s;he heard of her ill|ne&s;s, &s;he received a letter from JULIA, informing her that &s;he &s;hould &s;oon be able to commence her journey, to France; the benevolent heart of this worthy woman, was rejoiced at this news, and &s;he &s;ent off one of her own carriages, with her woman, and two men &s;ervants, to wait upon JU|LIA from Spain, and fraught with letters, breath|ing the mo&s;t tenderly affectionate expre&s;&s;ions, from the Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uis, as well as his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>JULIA was &s;o much delighted at this proof of the Counte&s;s's attachment, that it accelerated her perfect recovery, and rendered her doubly impa|tient to be with friends, who&s;e affection, even ab|&s;cence and affliction could not le&s;&s;en. She had it in her power, to reward ever per&s;on, in Madam GYRON's hou&s;e, for every trouble &s;he had occa|&s;ioned, and for the various proofs they had given of their regard, and attachment. And with re|doubled gratitude, and affection; with many tears and few profe&s;&s;ions, &s;he took leave of friends that &s;he found her&s;elf bound to, by ties of friend|&s;hip

and obligation; and &s;et off for France, &s;ev|en weeks after &s;he had prepared to go there be|fore.</P>

CARLOS wi&s;hed to have gone &s;till farther, and even to Paris, but &s;he excu&s;ed her&s;elf from con&s;enting to this reque&s;t. She e&s;teemed and valued this young gentleman, but &s;he was not blind to the progre&s;s that an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion had made in his heart and con&s;titution, and longed for that ab&s;ence, that &s;he thought would ea&s;e, what could not be rewarded. This young gentleman im|mediately after his return to M&mdash;, embarked for London, hoping by change of &s;cene, and a va|riety of objects, to era&s;e in &s;ome mea&s;ure from his heart, an attachment, that rendered him wretch|ed.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days &s;he travelled unmole&s;ted; but when with in half a days journey of Paris, when &s;he was in anticipation, of enjoying the embraces of the Marquis, and his &s;i&s;ter, and longing to &s;pring from the carriage to their arms; the coach was &s;topped by four men, on hor&s;eback; one of whom opened the door, and de&s;ired JULIA to alight; at fir&s;t &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed the per&s;ons footpads, and offered them her pur&s;e, while her waiting woman and ANNET produced theirs for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but the men refu&s;ed the money, and told her it was her&s;elf they wanted; the woman clung around her, but her cries and their entreaties were e|qually vain; they dragged her from the carriage; and &s;eated her in a chai&s;e, that was in waiting, and

two of them entered with her and bid the po&s;til|lion drive on.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action &s;eemed performed by the pow|er of magic; and &s;he found her&s;elf between two ruffians, and almo&s;t before &s;he had the power to recollect her&s;elf. But when &s;he looked behind and &s;aw her own carriage driving &s;lowly the oppo&s;ite way, &s;he grew almo&s;t di&s;tracted, her rea&s;on was upon the point of de&s;erting her; and in language almo&s;t frantic, &s;he demanded to know by what authority they had forced her from her &s;ervants, and begged to be re&s;tored to her friends. One of the men replied, he acted by the direction of a ma&s;ter, whom it was his duty to obey, and that &s;he was going were &s;he would find &s;ervants e|nough, and friends too, if it was not her own fault.</P>
<P>She found arguments thrown away, and en|treaties lo&s;t, and knew it was wor&s;e than folly to attempt re&s;i&s;tance, &s;he therefore was &s;ilent, revolv|ing in her own mind the probable con&s;equence of this event. But to what end were her conjec|tures, and how impo&s;&s;ible for her to conceive the extent of the horrors that now &s;urrounded her. Her tears flowed without controul, and &s;he &s;at back in the chai&s;e quite ab&s;orbed in grief, while her companions did not notice her, and engaged in a conver&s;ation that would if &s;he had attended too, given her a wor&s;e opinion of them, than &s;he could conceive any one of the human race de&s;erv|ed. But her thoughts were bu&s;ily employed by the Marquis, the Counte&s;s, and her lover, whom her imagination painted as di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at her ab|&s;ence, and endeavouring in vain to re&s;cue her. A
<PB N="152" REF="039134_0148_1013B0F3DFC1BAF0">
gleam of hope &s;ometimes appeared to a&s;&s;ure her, that &s;uch active mea&s;ures would be taken, that &s;he &s;hould be re&s;tored to her friends. A youth|ful mind, and a good one, will always form ex|pectations, that &s;ome fortunate event, may re&s;tore the ble&s;&s;ings they have lo&s;t, and pre&s;ent tho&s;e they wi&s;h for; while judgment, matured by frequent di&s;appointment, and by mi&s;fortunes, will acknow|ledge the hope, romantic, and the wi&s;h vain, and futile.</P>
<P>The little acquaintance &s;he had made in the world, had convinced her of the power of mon|ney. Her pur&s;e was well filled, and &s;he hoped by that means to procure her liberty. She did not doubt but the Count was her per&s;ecutor, &s;he &s;till dreaded his power, yet flattered her&s;elf that &s;he &s;hould be able, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and care of heaven, to elude his arts, and e&s;cape the evils he had prepared for her; upon ob&s;erving one of the men with attention, &s;he thought &s;he had &s;ee him before. He was tall, and had a &s;toop in his &s;houl|ders, and while &s;he endeavoured to recollect, when his voice convinced her, that he was the fortune|teller, that had foretold her di&s;appointment at the ma&s;querade. In this conjecture, &s;he was right; for this fellow had watched her motion from her fir&s;t arrival in Spain, and had got information of every &s;tep &s;he had taken, determined that &s;he &s;hould be di&s;appointed; it was not very &s;urpri&s;|ing that he was quite a &s;killful a&s;trologer. Her &s;ickne&s;s had at that time prevented his execution of a plan, of which he was a diabolical agent, to a no le&s;s diabilocal &s;uperior.</P>
<P>In the&s;e reflections, the day was &s;pent; and
<PB N="153" REF="039134_0149_1013B0F561C28460">
night coming on, a full moon &s;hewed her a va&s;t extent of woods and plains, while &s;he &s;eemed to be travelling above them; indeed the carriage had a&s;cended a long ridge of hills, and went over a very rough road, with a&s;toni&s;hing velocity. It was after midnight, they de&s;cended into a level plain, and &s;oon after &s;topped at a lofty man&s;ion, that &s;eemed to have bid defiance to the hand of time. It was large, &s;pacious and magnificent. But its brown walls, and lofty turretts informed the traveller, that it had been built in times of old; they entered by a large gate, that opened upon a court that was occupied by a variety of buildings, and that &s;tood at the back of the chatteau. She was then taken from the carriage, and a large bell that hung at the portal of the door, was rung, to give notice of their arrival.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before any one came, and &s;he had full time to &s;urvey the moon, which in full orbed maje&s;ty, now &s;hone from its meridian height; &s;he &s;ighed, when &s;he thought of various regions it overlooked, and a&s;ked her heart if one more wretched then her&s;elf, now gazed upon it. Perhaps at that very time, COLWORT was look|ing upon that cha&s;te planet; perhaps too, his thoughts were as ardently fixed upon her, as hers were upon wretchedne&s;s. Oh could he but know, (&s;aid &s;he,) how quick, he would fly to my relief! Her meditations were di&s;turbed by the appearance of two women, and a man &s;ervant, who were not half dre&s;&s;ed. Well, &s;aid the man, you are come at la&s;t; we have been looking for you, this three days. And a good look out you have kept, &s;aid one of her conductors; here you
<PB N="154" REF="039134_0150_1013B0F819511FF8">
are all a&s;leep, while you ought to have been upon the watch. Come get us &s;ome &s;upper, cried ano|ther; we are &s;harp &s;et, and will eat all you have in the hou&s;e. The devil a bit have I ta&s;ted, &s;ince five o'clock la&s;t night; and you SUSAN, do you look to this young woman, and &s;ee that &s;he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">very thing, that is comfortable.</P>
<P>JULIA followed the woman acro&s;s a large hall, and up a winding &s;tairca&s;e; &s;he then cro&s;&s;ed two old fa&s;hioned, but magnificent chambers, and af|ter pa&s;&s;ing two or three &s;mall entries, &s;topped at a chamber, where the woman &s;et down the light. This &s;he found was the end of her journey; fa|tigued with riding eighteen or twenty hours, &s;he would gladly have re&s;ted, but a dreadful fear pre|vented her &s;etting down; &s;he knew this mu&s;t be the Count DE LAUNA's Chateau; &s;he had heard much of it, and what &s;he had &s;een, an&s;wered the de&s;cription; be&s;ides &s;he &s;aw hid beneath the hor&s;|men's coat, the DE LAUNA livery upon &s;everal of the men. She now turned to one of the women and a&s;ked if her lord was at home. No Madam|oi&s;elle, he is in Paris; how long has he been ab|&s;ent, (a&s;ked JULIA, taking courage at her an&s;wer,) it is &s;ix month's &s;ince he was here; and then only for a few days, with &s;ome friends. And when is he expected, demanded JULIA! In a fortnight, (re|plied the girl,) his father the Marquis, has been &s;ick, but is now getting better. But (cryed the other, mi&s;taking the cau&s;e of her enquiries,) you &s;hall be as well treated, as though he was here, and want for nothing, Madamoi&s;elle; to this odd rejoinder, JULIA did not reply. You look &s;adly fatigued, Madamoi&s;elle, (&s;aid one of the women;)
<PB N="155" REF="039134_0151_1013B0F99C0F3270">
you had better take &s;ome refre&s;hment, and go to bed. Di&s;appointed, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, chagrined, and fatigued as JULIA was, &s;he had not learned to doubt the veracity of any one; and mi&s;tru&s;t, was not added to the catalogue of evils, &s;he now endured. What the girl had told her was &s;trictly true, but one more acquainted with deceit, would have doubted her word. Thus, con&s;cious innocence, though not its own protector, is a &s;hield again&s;t &s;u&s;picion, and a comforter in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>She was &s;o delighted to find the Count was ab&s;ent, that almo&s;t half her woes were lo&s;t in that joy. She accepted the propo&s;ed refre&s;hment, and went to bed, committing her&s;elf to the care of that power, who&s;e eye pervades the abode of dark|ne&s;s, and haunts of mi&s;ery; and enjoyed &s;everal hours of interrupted repo&s;e.</P>

<BIBL>MERRY'S PAINS OF MEMORY.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN &s;he awoke, the horrors of her &s;itu|ation ru&s;hed upon her mind; &s;he had not as formerly, ANNET, as a companion; that faith|ful girl, who was a comforter to her in her pri&s;on; a nur&s;e in her &s;ickne&s;s, and a friend in her exile; who had &s;hared all her joys, and all her &s;orrows, was now with the Counte&s;s; and JULIA a pri&s;oner alone, and wretched, friendle&s;s and for|lorn; far from the &s;oothings of friend&s;hip, and di&s;tant from the cheerful voice of tho&s;e &s;he loved; in the power of a man, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed wealth and honour, and who was unprincipled, and wicked to the la&s;t degree of vice.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e and &s;urveyed her chamber. It was large, and furni&s;hed with crim&s;on velvet, fringed with gold; but &s;o old, that it was black and tar|ni&s;hed; the chairs and toilet were the &s;ame, as the bed. An high old fa&s;hioned japaned bureau &s;tood in one corner; and the floor was covered with India matra&s;s; the room was hung with tape&s;try, and had once been rich, and beautiful, but its
<PB N="157" REF="039134_0153_1013B1015698A718">
beauty was lo&s;t, to memory; and its value gone forever. The windows were of painted gla&s;s, and emitted &s;o little light, as rather to increa&s;e, than le&s;&s;en the gloom; &s;he looked from them, and found the pro&s;pect exten&s;ive, and delightful; hills, vales, and meadows, crowned with lofty trees, and &s;pread with verdant foliage, inter&s;per&s;ed with rivers; the &s;treams of which, were in &s;everal pla|ces cro&s;&s;ed by bridges, formed at once, a view, grand, noble and maje&s;tic; and in the contem|plation of the beauties of nature, her heart a&s;|&s;umed &s;omething of its u&s;ual tranquillity, and be|came more a&s;&s;ured, as &s;he looked upon the vari|ous flocks that bleated in the meadows; alas! &s;aid &s;he, I am as innocent as they are; why am I not &s;o happy? Her rea&s;on replied, they have not the &s;ame reflective qualities, they are in&s;en&s;i|ble to the charms of innocence; and to the blackne&s;s of vice, &s;ay, who would barter the &s;en|&s;ibilities that refined rea&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, for the mean &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures they enjoy; fed, but to be fitted for the knife of the butcher, or rendered delicious, for the table of the voluptuary; they catch the tran&s;ient joy of the moment, nor dream that to|morrow, they &s;hall be &s;erved up as a fea&s;t for the hungry, or the glutton, while I, &s;aid JULIA, tho' oppre&s;&s;ed and unhappy, look forward to futurity with hope, and bli&s;sful certainty.</P>
<P>The woman, now entered with her breakfa&s;t, and &s;he eat but little, and endeavoured to enter into conver&s;ation with her; it was neither of tho&s;e &s;he had &s;een the night before; age had ren|dered her re&s;pectable; her hair was white, and time with his relentle&s;s finger had impre&s;&s;ed her
<PB N="158" REF="039134_0154_1013B10437F7D1E0">
fore-head with his wrinkles; &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed de|cently, and very neat, but not the lea&s;t appear|ance of finery. She &s;at down the &s;alver which &s;he had brought, but did not look JULIA in the face; nor did &s;he &s;peak. JULIA viewed her with attention, and the examination of her features filled her with a plea&s;ing hope; how long, good woman, &s;aid &s;he, have you lived at the chatteau? It is above nineteen years, &s;he replied. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e then (&s;aid JULIA, with a &s;igh) you are much attached to the Count? I am attached to my duty, and that leads me to regard the inter|e&s;t of my employer. Was you ever in the &s;ervice of any one el&s;e, a&s;ked JULIA? I &s;erved the good old Marquis, his grandfather, and the pre&s;ent wor|thy Marquis, his father, (replied &s;he,) and there love and duty went together. You know the Marquis, then &s;aid JULIA? I know him and love him too. But he could not love what was not good, cried the old woman. At that moment &s;he looked in JULIA's face, you look good, &s;he added, but we are often deceived. Do you &s;uppo&s;e me vicious, a&s;ked JULIA? I have no right to &s;uppo&s;e you &s;o, &s;he replied, but if you are, as it is &s;aid, a kept mi&s;tre&s;s of the Count, you cannot be much the rever&s;e. Good heaven, &s;aid JULIA, does any one s&s;uppo&s;e me &s;o; I am innocent, I dete&s;t the Count, he has ba&s;ely forced me from my friends; the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA is my benefactre&s;s; he has artfully brought me here. Oh do believe, that I love virtue, and hate vice. I do believe you, &s;aid the old woman, for you have not the look of one of tho&s;e bad women; but I was told you were a mi&s;tre&s;s he had long kept, and that you
<PB N="159" REF="039134_0155_1013B105B9C27FC0">
were eloping with another man. It is fal&s;e, &s;aid JULIA, indeed, it is fal&s;e; I never was the mi&s;t|re&s;s of any one, and hope I never &s;hall be. She then told the hone&s;t and faithful PHILADA e|nough of her &s;tory, to intere&s;t and convince her; the kind creature who&s;e heart was attuned to the &s;oft &s;en&s;ation of pity, a&s;&s;ured JULIA, that &s;he &s;hould have every liberty it was in her power to give her, and that &s;he would try to a&s;&s;i&s;t her e&s;cape; but that &s;he feared would be impo&s;&s;ible: She per&s;uaded her to eat; to be cheerful, and told her, that &s;he might range at plea&s;ure, around all the apartments, up|on that floor; when JULIA with tears thank|ed her: She looked up in her face; you intere&s;t me Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid &s;he, for you look &s;o much like my good lady, the Marchione&s;s, that I can|not help loving you; &s;he then went down, leav|ing the chamber door unlocked, that &s;he might vi&s;it the others, when her inclination led her.</P>
<P>It was not long before JULIA, profited by this liberty, for though curio&s;ity was not her pre|vailing pa&s;&s;ion; though &s;he knew how to &s;uppre&s;s it, yet &s;he had her &s;hare.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t room &s;he entered, was furni&s;hed with yellow &s;atin, and was fre&s;h and hand&s;ome; the &s;econd with gilt leather, but neither had any thing to intere&s;t the heart, or call up any of its better feelings; but the third was wholly fur|ni&s;hed with books and pictures; the window|curtains were of a dark &s;carlet dama&s;k, with &s;ilver fringe; a writing table that had long been unu&s;|ed, &s;tood in the middle; a large pier gla&s;s hung between the windows, and the books were arrang|ed upon &s;helves, from the floor to the ceiling;
<PB N="160" REF="039134_0156_1013B1074A5C7740">
while the pictures occupied the oppo&s;ite pannels. At the fir&s;t glance, &s;he knew the Counte&s;s and the Marquis, and her affectionate heart did hom|age, even to their re&s;emblance, &s;ketched upon the &s;en&s;ele&s;s canva&s;s; but her attention was much en|gro&s;ed by one of uncommon beauty, that hung be&s;ide the Marquis. This picture reminded JULIA, of &s;ome painting, or per&s;on that &s;he had &s;een before. The drapery was at the &s;ame time, a combination of &s;implicity and elegance; the charming countenance was lovely, and expre&s;&s;ive, and her &s;oft blue eyes, &s;eemed fixt upon tho&s;e that were viewing them: She held upon her fin|gers a bird, and the benevolence that was expre&s;|&s;ed in her looks; told the mo&s;t cur&s;ory ob&s;erver, that the little flutterer was happy. JULIA con|templated this picture for &s;ome time, &s;he left it, walked to the other &s;ide of the room, but return|ed to it in a moment; &s;he was drawn, by a power, that &s;he did not fully under&s;tand; but it was irre&s;i&s;tible; while &s;he &s;till gazed upon it, PHILADA entered. I have brought you &s;ome books, Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid &s;he, that will I believe, plea&s;e you better than tho&s;e in the library. Have you looked at this picture, Madamoi&s;elle? JULIA replied, &s;he had; and that &s;he was charmed with it; and it was a very lovely picture. Is the ori|ginal alive? Oh no, cried PHILADA, with a deep &s;igh; &s;he has been dead for many years; that picture was taken for the Marchione&s;s, before &s;he left Italy, and &s;ent by the Marquis to his &s;on. It is the very image of her, &s;aid &s;he; ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;weet &s;mile; &s;he always wore ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;oft look; how often have I &s;een the tears in her
<PB N="161" REF="039134_0157_1013B10C918E2400">
mild eyes, when &s;he &s;aw any body unhappy. That picture at the right hand is the Marquis; he &s;eems to be looking back upon the other, that was his fir&s;t wife, the Count's mother: She was a pretty creature, but a mere baby, and not to be compared to the other. There Madamoi&s;elle, is the Count, and Counte&s;s DE LAUNA, they were a noble couple, and looked as grand and good, as you &s;ee them there. And who is this, &s;aid JULIA, that hangs behind the Counte&s;s? It is a young Engli&s;h Lord, (replied PHILADA,) that loved her, and Madam was &s;adly in love, with him; they were privately married; but the friends contriv|ed to break it off; if has co&s;t Madam, many a tear. JULIA now examined this picture with a &s;crutiny, that was occa&s;ioned by hearing the Counte&s;s remark, the re&s;emblance, between her lover, and COLWORT; &s;he &s;aw indeed, a likene&s;s, but not the &s;triking one, that &s;he expected; &s;he turned to the portrait, that adorned the other &s;ide, and enquired who they were? The&s;e on the left, &s;aid her kind informer, are the old Count and Counte&s;s; the&s;e on the right, the old Mar|quis, and his lady. Do Madamoi&s;elle, look in the gla&s;s, (added &s;he, as &s;he wiped off the du&s;t that had gathered upon it, with an handkerchief,) do look in the gla&s;s, and then look upon this picture, of the young Marchione&s;s; and tell me if you do not &s;ee a likene&s;s. I think I do, replied JULIA, after &s;he had for a moment done as &s;he was reque&s;ted; but it is perhaps owing to my vanity. Oh Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid PHILADA, if you are as much like my lady in action, as you are in looks, you are good indeed; but I hope you will
<PB N="162" REF="039134_0158_1013B10E129BA818">
be more &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tunate. Why, &s;aid JULIA, I thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Marchione&s;s, very happy. Did not &s;he love the Marquis? Yes, and he loved; and if they had been let alone, they would have been happy until now together. Why &s;aid JULIA, a&s;toni&s;hed, what happened to them, and who interfered to prevent their happine&s;s? Why, Madamoi&s;elle, the Count hated her; but he fell &s;ick, and pre|tended to repent, and &s;o the Marquis brought her, to &s;ee him; would to heaven &s;he had never come. I attended my lady; &s;he had another woman with her, who loved her as well as I did; She had come from Italy, with her lady, and was always near her; but what could we do? But Madamoi&s;elle, I am telling you things, that does not concern you, and doing very wrong too, I fear. I think not, &s;aid JULIA, I beg you would proceed; depend upon it, I will never betray you. I do not know how it is, &s;aid PHILADA, but I cannot find it, in my heart, to deny you any thing. Well, as I was &s;aying, we came to this chatteau, and the Count got well, but &s;lowly; and the Marquis was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, for fear he was go|ing into a con&s;umption; and loath to leave him alone a per&s;uaded the Marchione&s;s to lay in here, for the Marquis was obliged to go to Spain; and after he was gone, the Count fell in love with his mother in law; the Marchione&s;s was frighted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and cried night and day; and wrote to the Marquis, and would never let us be ab&s;ent from her for a moment. Well, Madam|oi&s;elle, the Count was enraged at her refu&s;al, and vowed he would be revenged, and my lady was &s;cared to death, and took to her bed, and at la&s;t
<PB N="163" REF="039134_0159_1013B110C8BFE610">
was brought to bed of a little daughter; and that very day, the Count was clo&s;eted with a phy&s;i|cian, for &s;everal hours, who left him and went immediately into my lady's apartment, and per|&s;uaded her to take an Elixer, as he called it. She was always &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, to other people's will, and did as he de&s;ired her; but &s;he grew wor&s;e, and remembered how the Count had threatened her, and &s;he thought &s;he was dying; &s;he called me to her bed &s;ide, with ISABELLA. PHILADA &s;aid &s;he, tell the Marqui&s;s I ever loved him, tell him that I fell a &s;acrifice to that love; take care of my child; I wi&s;h the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA could bring her up; but I charge you both to deliver her to my Lord; &s;he &s;aid much more, but I am a weak creature, and went into fits, but my poor lady died that night, and her little daughter died too, and the maid was carried off, for I have never &s;een her &s;ince; but I believe the Count had her conveyed away, and knew what was become of her. GOD forgive him; I fear I never &s;hall. And you think, &s;aid JULIA, who had li&s;tened, with emotion to the artle&s;s tale of PHILADA; you think the cordial proved fatal to the poor Marchione&s;s; why did not you in|form again&s;t the phy&s;ician? Oh yes, &s;aid PHILA|DA, it proved fatal; but what could a poor &s;er|vant do, again&s;t a rich and powerful Lord? the Marquis grew di&s;tracted, the Count DE LAUNA was killed in a duel; and Madam left the world for retirement; &s;o that the matter was hu&s;hed up, but I believe the Count &s;uffers &s;ometimes in his own mind, though he does not believe in GOD, or the bible; I know he is afraid of &s;pi|rits,
<PB N="164" REF="039134_0160_1013B1136F7B8868">
and I believe he is haunted; with a troubled con&s;cience, &s;aid JULIA; but the pure &s;pirit of the amiable Marchione&s;s, will never leave the realms of bli&s;s, to di&s;turb him; would to heaven I was with her, for I &s;hudder to think that I am in the power of a murderer, an athei&s;t, an un|natural man; who fears not GOD and believes not in a future &s;tate. Do aid me PHILADA; do a&s;&s;i&s;t me to e&s;cape; and you &s;hall never come to any harm by your kindne&s;s. I will try, Madam|oi&s;elle, I will do all in my power; but this hou&s;e is &s;trongly &s;ecured and guarded, and I am watch|ed, and am afraid I &s;hall not be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t you. Why Madamoi&s;elle, there has been in the pri&s;on, under the chatteau, per&s;ons confined for years and years together, and I do not know if they are men or women; but three nights ago, they brought another, that was a man; but I do not know who it is. Where are they confined, &s;aid JULIA? She an&s;wered in the pri&s;on, beneath this part of the chatteau; but it is very deep, and a great way off.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, PHILADA was &s;ummoned to the kitchen, and JULIA was left for the remainder of the day, to indulge the mo&s;t painful apprehen|&s;ions, for the information &s;he had received, had rendered every idea gloomy, and every thought &s;ad; how often do we pay this heavy tax, for the indulgence of our curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>That, and the following day, &s;he did not &s;ee PHILADA, but on the third morning, that vener|able dome&s;tic, brought her breakfa&s;t; &s;he apo|logized for not having come before, as &s;he had been bu&s;y in preparing the &s;pring fea&s;t, for the
<PB N="165" REF="039134_0161_1013B1174FF4ABC8">
va&s;&s;als of the Count; and to day Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hall be fully employed in getting mat|ters to rights, &s;o that I &s;hall not be able to attend upon you my&s;elf, until tomorrow; but you look &s;ad and gloomy, would not a walk do you good; if it is agreeable to you, you can walk upon the terrace that &s;urrounds the upper part of this building. Alas! &s;aid JULIA, I cannot be di|verted from my melancholy reflections; for I have &s;o faint a hope of being freed from the machinations of this dreadful man, that I cannot but be unhappy. But you are very good, PHI|LADA; formerly I &s;hould have enjoyed the pro&s;|pect that I am &s;ure the terrace affords, and I will go now, as you &s;o kindly propo&s;e it.</P>
<P>PHILADA looked upon her with pity, as &s;he led the way acro&s;s the chamber, and up two nar|row &s;tairca&s;es; &s;he then opened a door, and they were immediately upon the terrace. It would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the beauties of the exten|&s;ive view, that were pre&s;ented, and JULIA lo&s;t her pre&s;ent woes and anticipated evils, in delight and a&s;toni&s;hment; &s;he tarried here for &s;everal hours, and only returned to her chamber at the time PHILADA had reque&s;ted &s;he would receive her dinner; as &s;he was cautious that no one of the &s;ervants &s;hould know, of the liberty &s;he allowed her.</P>
<P>Her mind had experienced &s;ome tranquillity, while enjoying the fre&s;h air, and cheering pro&s;|pect; but when &s;he returned to her own apart|ment, the illu&s;ion fled; the bubble was di&s;&s;olved, and in &s;pite of fancy, &s;he was wretched. After ta&s;ting of her &s;olitary meal, &s;he opened a vo|lume
<PB N="166" REF="039134_0162_1013B119F4C76DC8">
that lay on the table, and endeavored to read; but the charm that once gave her plea&s;ure in peru&s;ing the works of genius, was fled; the beauties of poetry, cea&s;ed to delight; the hi&s;tor|ic page, to in&s;truct; and the fiction of romance, to amu&s;e; "hope, to borrow the words of an enchanting writer; had cea&s;ed to illumine the horizon of her pro&s;pects, and dark clouds, and gloomy de&s;pair, occupied its place."</P>
<P>In this de&s;pondent &s;ituation, &s;he &s;pent &s;everal hours; but her chamber was warm, and &s;he a|gain &s;ought the fre&s;h air of the terrace. The &s;un which was near &s;itting, ju&s;t emerged from a cloud, and its yellow rays, darted with refulgent beauty acro&s;s the horizon, and &s;urrounding hills; the &s;oft rain that had ju&s;t fell, had refre&s;hed the mea|dows; and a gentle fragrance aro&s;e, like &s;moak|ing incen&s;e to heaven. At a &s;mall di&s;tance, &s;he beheld &s;ome fi&s;hermen, that had drawn their nets to the &s;hore; one, had hung the finny fair upon a pole, and thrown it acro&s;s his &s;houlders; he walked towards his cottage; three children ran out to meet him; his wife &s;tood in the door, and by her ge&s;ture &s;eemed to invite his ha&s;te, to partake of the repa&s;t, &s;he had prepared. JULIA's fancy followed him in; &s;he &s;aw him &s;eated; the coar&s;e, but clean table-cloth; the frugal meal; heard the laugh of the children; and the ac|cents of love and welcome from the wife; and formed &s;o delightful a picture, that her imagina|tions loved to dwell upon it.</P>
<P>But the bleating of the flocks, awakened her from the delu&s;ion, and &s;he beheld in reality the fre&s;h and ruddy milk maid, bending beneath her
<PB N="167" REF="039134_0163_1013B11B772631D0">
full pail; while the lowing herd, and fleecy flocks, &s;eemed prepared to take that repo&s;e, which indul|gent nature, allows to weary man; to all, but me, &s;aid JULIA, all can repo&s;e; but alas! for me, far from tho&s;e I love; the &s;weets of &s;lumber are denied me, and I have not one vi&s;ion, that can lull me to repo&s;e, not a thought that can comfort me waking, or one idea, that can &s;ugge&s;t an a|greeable dream.</P>
<P>While &s;he leaned again&s;t one of the battle|ments, &s;he indulged the&s;e de&s;ponding &s;ugge&s;|tions; but before &s;he had pur&s;ued them long; her attention was arou&s;ed by the opening of a door; looking around, &s;he &s;aw a female that had ju&s;t entered the terrace; her form was ma|je&s;tic; her motion &s;low, but graceful; and her dre&s;s was of the fine&s;t mu&s;lin, which floated in the wind; her back was towards JULIA; &s;he ob&s;erved that her &s;teps were weak, and trem|bling; and that as &s;he walked &s;he held by the bani&s;ters; &s;he walked away, and JULIA longed to &s;ee her face; felt all the force of curio&s;ity, mingled with &s;urpri&s;e; &s;he would have followed her, but feared &s;uch a conduct, might be imper|tinent, and obtru&s;ive; it was not five minutes before &s;he returned; and looking at JULIA, cla&s;ped her hands, and rai&s;ed her eyes, as a&s;ton|i&s;hed and affrighted.</P>
<P>Oh Heaven! exclaimed &s;he, it is my &s;i&s;ter; my ble&s;&s;ed, beautiful &s;i&s;ter; come from the com|pany of angels; from the &s;ociety of &s;aints, from worlds of purity and joy. Oh, tell me, tell thy mi&s;erable LEONORA; when &s;hall I be freed from the&s;e fetters? when freed from a &s;en&s;e of guilt?
<PB N="168" REF="039134_0164_1013B11F82DD13F8">
when will my crimes be blotted out? when &s;hall I be at peace? Alas! &s;aid JULIA, I am a mor|tal, and a poor unhappy creature. Unhappy, re|plied &s;he; have you broke your vows? are you guilty? No, &s;aid JULIA, I am innocent of any great crime; yet I am mi&s;erable. Mi&s;ery is re|&s;erved for the guilty, replied &s;he wildly; the in|nocent have no claim to it. If indeed you have broken no vows, if your con&s;cience is free from &s;tain; and you do not look back with horror, upon &s;ome black tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, you are happy. The wildne&s;s of her fine eyes; the palene&s;s of her face; her cheeks faded; her forehead den&s;e; and her once beautiful no&s;e pinched by the hand of &s;ickne&s;s; &s;hewed indeed the &s;ad, the &s;orrow|ful picture of beauty in ruins; and tho&s;e ruins brought on, by the &s;tings of a wounded con|&s;cience; and an heart corroded by guilt. JU|LIA gazed on her with a&s;toni&s;hment, and with pity; &s;he was &s;ilent, and JULIA replied; but I have been forced from the friends I loved, de|prived of my liberty; a pri&s;oner within the&s;e ha|ted walls; and in the power of a ba&s;e, unprinci|pled man; do you wonder that I am unhappy? I, &s;aid the &s;tranger, have no friends; no fortune; I have lo&s;t my health; my title to the e&s;teem of the worthy; to the prayers of the virtuous; fled from my country; for&s;aken by the man I dared to love; who was the occa&s;ion of all my woes; I have broken my vows; vows too the mo&s;t &s;olemn; the mo&s;t &s;acred, which any one but an impious wretch, would have re&s;pected, and lo&s;t inevitably lo&s;t my peace of mind. Good heaven, &s;aid JULIA, what a catalogue of evils; let me

&s;ympathi&s;e with you, and I will forget my own &s;orrows, to mitigate your's. "Will that re&s;tore my honor; my fame? will that &s;tand between me, and divine ju&s;tice? will that compen&s;ate for the evils I have done to &s;ociety? Oh no; I am not to be trifled with; if indeed you are my &s;i&s;ter, tell me &s;o; and &s;ay, die LEONORA! and be at re&s;t." Oh, &s;aid JULIA, I have no &s;i&s;ter; I never knew &s;uch happine&s;s. "Well then, (replied the &s;tranger,) while a heavy &s;igh &s;eemed to rend her heart! but I &s;hall die; and &s;hortly be laid be|neath the clods of the valley; or confined with|in the dark and narrow limits of the tomb." As &s;he &s;poke, &s;he faultered; a &s;light convul&s;ion cro&s;|&s;ed her countenance; and but for JULIA, &s;he mu&s;t have fallen.</P>
<P>At that moment an attendant entered. Good heaven! SIGNORA, &s;aid &s;he, we have been di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed for you, but you are ill, and weak. Let me a&s;&s;i&s;t you to your chamber; &s;he then called up another female &s;ervant, and with great tender|ne&s;s and re&s;pect, per&s;uaded her to return. Lift me up, &s;aid &s;he, I would once more look towards England. JULIA a&s;&s;i&s;ted the women to rai&s;e her, &s;he looked to that part of the horizon, that pointed to the Briti&s;h &s;hores, and for a moment &s;eemed lo&s;t in thought. Alas! (&s;he cried, with a mournful accent,) alas! he dies there, the victim of his own perfidy, and fal&s;ehood; but the &s;acri|fice is not completely made; but one victim has fallen; another remains, and that &s;oon will com|pleat it; but GOD forgive him; I will go pray for his repo&s;e. She then leaned upon her dome&s;|tics, and left the terrace.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JULIA's pity and wonder prevented her fol|lowing &s;o &s;ad a &s;pectacle, and by dividing her concern, le&s;&s;ened it. She found her&s;elf innocent, and in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her rea&s;on, and &s;he bent with humble gratitude to heaven, for both the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. She prayed for their continuance; &s;he prayed too, for the poor unfortunate, &s;he had &s;een; &s;he a&s;ked the protection of that power, who is the guardian of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and let it not de|duct from her &s;en&s;ibility, when we &s;ay &s;he was calmer, and &s;lept better than &s;he had for &s;everal nights.</P>
<P>She awoke with the earlie&s;t rays of the morn|ing, and was not entirely dre&s;&s;ed, when PHILADA entered, with one of the young women &s;he had &s;een the day before upon the terrace. "I am &s;orry, Madamoi&s;elle, (&s;aid PHILADA,) that you met the SIGNORA ye&s;terday evening, &s;he has been &s;adly affrighted all night; and tells her attendants, &s;he has &s;een her &s;i&s;ter's apparition; IRESILLA, who waits upon her, has come to reque&s;t you will vi&s;it her in her own apartment, as &s;he is too low to leave her bed." JULIA replied, &s;he would go mo&s;t willingly. Will you, Madamoi&s;elle, be &s;o good as to promi&s;e me, not to mention the Count, if you &s;hould, it will bring me into great trouble?
<PB N="171" REF="039134_0167_1013B125332C1130">
Certainly (&s;aid JULIA,) I will never &s;ay any thing, that can injure you.</P>
<P>They then conducted JULIA acro&s;s &s;everal a|partments; till they opened a door that led to the &s;outh wing of the building; two chambers in this &s;uite were furni&s;hed in quite a modern &s;tile; and were much larger than any &s;he had &s;een; the third was the bed chamber of the unfortu|nate LEONORA. Upon a bed of yellow &s;ilk was laid this woman once &s;o lovely; always &s;o unfor|tunate; her emaciated arm, was out &s;ide the counterpane, while one hand was under her pale and faded cheek; the young lady you wi&s;hed &s;o much to &s;ee, is here (&s;aid IRESILLA.) JULIA approached the bed, and in gentle accents expre&s;|&s;ed her &s;orrow for the &s;tate &s;he &s;aw her in. For|give me, this trouble, lady, &s;aid the dying peni|tent; my imagination mi&s;led me; I thought you were my &s;i&s;ter; my faithful attendants were &s;orry to &s;ee me &s;o mi&s;taken; and you have kind|ly conde&s;cended to undeceive me; &s;et down, and if you can bear a &s;ick chamber, and &s;pare me a few moments your company, I think it will &s;ooth me. JULIA, &s;eated her&s;elf; &s;he a&s;&s;ured her, it would give her plea&s;ure to &s;pend &s;ome hours with her; and PHILADA withdrew, &s;aying &s;he would return by noon; &s;he then inquired of JU|LIA, if &s;he was of that country? I am a native of France, Madam, (&s;aid JULIA.) You are young and lovely, returned the &s;ick lady; but I fear you are not happy. "Indeed, replied JULIA, I am very far from being happy. I do not a&s;k the &s;ource of your misfortunes, rejoined the lady; for I am too ill to conver&s;e or attend; I mu&s;t advi&s;e you to keep a quiet con&s;cience; do not, for a
<PB N="172" REF="039134_0168_1013B12A631195B8">
temporary plea&s;ure, however flattering, involve your&s;elf in guilt; do not for one moment &s;uffer your&s;elf to think of happine&s;s, unattended by in|nocence; be a&s;&s;ured that it never was attained; be a&s;&s;ured likewi&s;e, that you cannot long be mi&s;|erable, while you pre&s;erve a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of hav|ing done your duty; of having acted upright; and pre&s;erving your honor; if afflictions crowd a|round you; if you are tempted to de&s;pond by their weight, and numbers; put your tru&s;t in him who has the peculiar care of innocence; be a&s;&s;ured the clouds will di&s;per&s;e, and he will ap|pear for your relief; for me, I have forfeited his love; but I have a &s;trong hold upon his mercy; and though I have lived &s;eventeen years, de&s;pair|ing and mi&s;erable, yet I die calm, &s;ati&s;fied, and compo&s;ed. For your in&s;truction, I will pre&s;ent you with a manu&s;cript; it is a &s;ad, but faithful narrative of my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and its attendant woes; while you read it, you will condemn me; it is your duty to do &s;o; but recollect the &s;tate, to which you have &s;een me reduced, and &s;hed a tear of &s;ympathy, for my failings, and my misfor|tunes."</P>
<P>"She then bid IRESILLA hand a ca&s;ket, and unlock it; here, (&s;aid &s;he) is the manu&s;cript; and with it, I beg you will accept of this picture; it is the miniature of my &s;i&s;ter, whom you &s;o much re&s;emble; keep it for my &s;ake, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtue, &s;he inherited, and you will be good indeed."</P>
<P>JULIA had been too much affected to an&s;wer; &s;he could now only pre&s;s the cold hand of LEO|NORA, to her lips, &s;he placed the picture in her bo&s;om; and after &s;ome time, thanked her for her beque&s;t, which &s;he a&s;&s;ured her &s;hould have
<PB N="173" REF="039134_0169_1013B12D233DAEC8">
an happy effect. If ever you are tempted to &s;werve from the paths of virtue, (&s;aid LEONORA) read that paper, and while you read it; remember you have &s;een the wretched writer, deprived of tho&s;e charms which rendered her an object of affection, upon the bed of death; deprived too, by the man who loved her, of that which alone could render her an object of e&s;teem&punc; to this &s;ad, this deplorable condition we all mu&s;t come; but it lays in the bo&s;om of all, to render the hour of death, happy or mi&s;erable. Had I endured all the au&s;terities of a convent; nobly combatted an illegal pa&s;&s;ion; and kept my faith unbroken; my temptations would now be a cau&s;e of triumph to me; and in joy, I &s;hould now leave a world, who&s;e vanity had failed to allure me; who&s;e vices had tempted me in vain; and in who&s;e wickedne&s;s I had ne|ver &s;hared. But now I &s;hrink from the conflict; I am fearful of offended ju&s;tice; and re&s;t only up|on forgiving mercy. As &s;he pronounced the la&s;t words, &s;he &s;unk back upon the pillow, faint and exhau&s;ted. JULIA wiped the cold damps from her face; &s;he endeavored to a&s;&s;ure her faith, with the promi&s;es of mercy, and forgivene&s;s; of di|vine love and con&s;olation; and with one of her cold hands in her's, &s;et by the bed, while &s;he &s;lept.</P>
<P>To have beheld an object the mo&s;t indifferent approaching its exit; &s;truggling with the la&s;t &s;ymptoms of a &s;low di&s;ea&s;e; combatting with the grim tyrant without a friend; without &s;trength; without &s;pirits; her heart would have melted with &s;ympathy, and &s;he would have felt the &s;en&s;ations of pity; but when &s;he beheld a wo|man, &s;en&s;ible, intere&s;ting, and lovely; reduc|ed
<PB N="174" REF="039134_0170_1013B12EA6070028">
by misfortune, and acknowledged guilt; Pale, faded, wan, and afflicted; without a friend or relation to &s;oothe; attended by &s;ervants; &s;trug|gling to &s;uppre&s;s her la&s;t &s;igh; while &s;he heard her in a &s;oft, trembling, and pathetic voice, ex|horting her to per&s;evere in the paths &s;he her&s;elf had for&s;aken; while the la&s;t breath was hover|ing upon her lips, inculcating the le&s;&s;ons of truth, and virtue; with an energy that exhau&s;ted her, and a pathos that almo&s;t wore her out; She gave a loo&s;e to her feelings, and her tears flowed without control.</P>
<P>It was near noon, when LEONORA awoke; but &s;o very weak, that &s;he could not &s;peak; ex|cept in a whi&s;per; after taking a cordial, &s;he &s;eemed inclined again to &s;leep, and PHILADA entering, reque&s;ted JULIA, to return to her cham|ber; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the cheek of the dying&punc; LEONO|RA; promi&s;ed to vi&s;it her the next day, and left her. As &s;oon as &s;he got to her chamber and had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed PHILADA, &s;he opened the paper, and read the following &s;tory of that unfortunate wo|man.</P>
<P>"It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, I am of a noble family, &s;ince the late beautiful and amiable Marchione&s;s of Alvada was my &s;i&s;ter; born in Italy, and edu|cated in a convent; the darling of a fond mother who loved her children &s;o well, as to &s;pend mo&s;t of her time with us; my heart never &s;werved from the rules of virtue; and honor was to me dearer than life. It was my bittere&s;t mi&s;fortune in early youth, to lo&s;e this be&s;t of mothers. After her death, I &s;pent &s;ome time with my father; and there became acquainted with an old noble|man, who wi&s;hed to marry me; my father flat|tered
<PB N="175" REF="039134_0171_1013B1315068E1C8">
with the propo&s;ed connection, pre&s;&s;ed my acceptance; but I refu&s;ed; he then offered me the choice of a nunnery for life, or marriage with the Duke. I had no alternative, and I did not he&s;itate; I embraced the latter; and with a holy zeal, immediately took the veil; and with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of mi&s;placed piety, performed all the duty of my &s;tation; and became an ex|ample to my &s;i&s;ter nuns, and gained the love and admiration of the &s;uperiors. For &s;everal years I was happy; but I lo&s;t my father; my &s;i&s;|ter married, and left Italy; my attachments to the world were le&s;&s;ened; my love to it abated; and I was &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly attached to my convent, and my religion. I &s;hed but few tears when my &s;i&s;ter died, though &s;he was the deare&s;t object of my earthly affection; and de&s;erved the love of all; but alas! my &s;orrows were then near commenc|ing; and it was time for me to bid adieu, to all tranquillity.</P>
<P>It was at a proce&s;&s;ion, at which, the duties of my &s;tation obliged me to make a public appear|ance; I &s;aw and was &s;een by an Engli&s;h noble|man; the moment his eyes met mine, I imbibed that fatal pa&s;&s;ion, that has &s;ince proved the de&s;|truction of my happine&s;s: whenever he pa&s;&s;ed me, his looks declared that our &s;en&s;ations were mutual; and I retired to my cell, confu&s;ed, ag|gitated and wretched: I could not read; I could not pray; my mind bur&s;t the walls of my con|vent; and my imagination conveyed me to the man who had cau&s;ed &s;uch anxiety; three days after I received a letter from him; it was filled with profe&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, and love; a corre&s;|pondence en&s;ued, for I had no power to re&s;i&s;t his
<PB N="176" REF="039134_0172_1013B13521B1CB20">
arts; and fell into the delu&s;ion, that &s;hut my eyes upon truth and its dictates. I &s;hall not pre|tend to recount the various methods he u&s;ed; nor the gradations, by which I lo&s;t a &s;en&s;e of du|ty: I vainly thought that I could reconcile a breach of my mo&s;t &s;olemn vows; pledged upon the &s;acred altar to the mo&s;t high, with honor and with love; and at la&s;t was &s;o infatuated, as to con&s;ent to e&s;cape from my convent, and go to England, upon his promi&s;e that he would &s;end &s;ome one, in whom he could confide, to meet me at Bru&s;&s;els, and conduct me to London; where I &s;hould be introduced to him in the pre|&s;ence of his mother and family, and that the holy prie&s;t &s;hould be in waiting, and the day of my arrival &s;hould make me his wife.</P>
<P>His word once pledged, I dreamt not that he could break it; nor did I once think, I had &s;et him an example, that he would follow: I was infatuated by a blind pa&s;&s;ion, that triumphed o|ver truth, and religion; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et death, and dan|ger at defiance; for I ri&s;qued my life, by break|ing my vows; and ran va&s;t hazard and danger by making my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>But I &s;urmounted every difficulty, and got the better of every fear; and with two faithful dome&s;tics, left my convent; and arrived at Lon|don; hitherto his promi&s;es had been punctually fulfilled. I had been met as he had appointed; and attended with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect; but the moment I arrived, he &s;uppo&s;ed me in his power, and though he did not throw a&s;ide the ma&s;k in|tirely: I found my&s;elf di&s;appointed; in&s;tead of being conducted to his mother, and met by his relations, I was informed his venerable parent was

&s;o ill, as to preclude the po&s;&s;ibility of my being in|troduced to her; and that of con&s;equence, my nuptials mu&s;t be delayed.</P>
<P>I entertained no &s;u&s;picion; but my regard to my honor, bid me ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to &s;ee my lover, until I could be acknowledged as his wife, before all his connections; and though I made as great a &s;acrifice to reputation, as ever was made, I obeyed the dictates of honor; in the interval, which I was per&s;uaded to believe would be &s;hort, I endeavored to perfect my&s;elf in the Engli&s;h language; my wi&s;hes, my ardent wi&s;hes to plea&s;e the man I con&s;idered as my hu&s;band, were &s;uch a &s;timulus to my exertion, that I became a profi|cient, and in a very &s;hort time I was able to con|ver&s;e in the language that I loved, in preference to any other, merely becau&s;e it was the language of the man I loved.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed to prove my&s;elf worthy his choice; to gain the e&s;teem of his friends; particularly of his mother, who I found was con&s;idered as the be&s;t of women; and I was ardent in the pur&s;uit of every prai&s;eworthy accompli&s;hment.</P>

<P>My temper, naturally warm, was rai&s;ed; I for|bid him my pre&s;ence; and wrote my lover, to require an explanation of his conduct; and a di|rect avowal of his de&s;igns; before I received his an&s;wer, I was informed that I had been con&s;idered as an infamous woman; as a kept mi&s;tre&s;s of his lord&s;hip; that the per&s;ons to whom I had been introduced were of &s;u&s;picious characters.</P>
<P>Good GOD, what were my &s;en&s;ations, at this information; I even now &s;hudder to reflect upon the horror of my mind; I was every thing but di&s;tracted.</P>

of the arts that had been u&s;ed to &s;educe me from my country; I &s;tayed not for an an&s;wer; but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a countryman, who had been my friend from my fir&s;t arrival, I &s;et out for Italy, and left my unhappy followers in his care; for had they returned, their lives were forfeited by law for having aided a nun, to e&s;cape from her convent.</P>
<P>But for the humanity of this gentleman, I &s;hould have gone directly back to my convent, and received the puni&s;hment that I de&s;erved, a &s;evere puni&s;hment; a lingering and cruel death; but his per&s;ua&s;ions prevailed, and I was admitted into another nunnery, as a pen&s;ioner; the little property that I had been able to take with me, I had divided between my &s;ervants; what I left behind, became the property of the convent; &s;o that I was entirely de&s;titute, and but for this gen|erous man, mu&s;t have been indebted to &s;trangers; and while he lived, he paid my board; but in five years, this worthy friend paid the great debt of nature, and fell a &s;acrifice to the king of ter|rors, and I was again de&s;titute.</P>

<P>The Marquis ALVADA, heard of my &s;ituation, and offered me an a&s;ylum at this place; I accept|ed his generous offer, and found every thing pre|pared for my reception, that could render life bearable: But alas! how vain for a guilty mind, to &s;eek for peace, how vain the care of friend&s;hip! the pomp of wealth! the ea&s;e of affluence! or the a&s;&s;iduity of the worthy!</P>

I accu&s;ed my &s;ate of cruelty; I &s;purned again&s;t the Divine decrees, and murmured at the will of Heaven; my days were pa&s;&s;ed in &s;orrow, and my nights in lamentation; but now that I had no employment, that every thing was provided for me; that no tongue accu&s;ed me; that no voice condemned; now that I became the object of &s;ympathy, I had lei&s;ure to look into my heart; I accu&s;ed and condemned my&s;elf; my con&s;cience bore witne&s;s again&s;t me; my guilt &s;tared me in the face; my broken vows aro&s;e in judgment a|gain&s;t me; I endeavored in vain to forget my trangre&s;&s;ions; I changed my name; I charged my attendants, never to mention it, or ought that could &s;ugge&s;t one di&s;tre&s;&s;ing idea.</P>
<P>But my endeavors were fruitle&s;s; my rea&s;on and my mi&s;ery could not exi&s;t together; as there was no remedy for the latter, the former fell a &s;acrifice; and for &s;everal years, I was a confirm|ed maniac; at length I grew better; my rea&s;on was in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored; and my recollec|tion, my painful recollection returned; but my health has gradually decayed, and I am now in the la&s;t &s;tages of a con&s;umption; and &s;o grievous are my &s;elf-reflections; &s;o acute the accu&s;ations of my own con&s;cience; that at &s;ome periods I am not my&s;elf, but a poor di&s;tracted creature.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>I give thee joy! thou ha&s;t e&s;caped from woe;</L>
<L>And all the cares of guilt, and pain below.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JULIA wept over the above narrative, and found it to be the very &s;tory that ROUSSEAU with his pen of fire tran&s;lated from the original language, and gave to the world as his la&s;t pro|duction; the letters of an Italian nun and an Engli&s;h nobleman; &s;he remembered that the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA had told her, the corre&s;pon|dence was original, and that the facts had come within her own knowledge.</P>
<P>Her reflections were &s;uch as may be imagined; &s;he &s;aw more to pity than blame; &s;he &s;ighed at the frailty of human nature; and endeavored to forget her errors, in the contemplation of her &s;ufferings, and the recollection of her virtues.</P>
<P>The next morning &s;he renewed her vi&s;it, and found this unfortunate woman ju&s;t breathing her la&s;t; as &s;he could not whi&s;per con&s;olation to her departing &s;pirit, for &s;he lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;he quitted the room in a &s;tate of mind, ea&s;ier to be conceiv|ed, than de&s;cribed; in le&s;s than an hour PHILA|DA came up, and informed her the la&s;t &s;igh was over, and that the &s;oul was freed from its clayey tenement, and emancipated from &s;in and guilt. She likewi&s;e informed JULIA that as many per|&s;ons would be naturally about the hou&s;e, for &s;ome days, that her walks upon the terrace, and
<PB N="183" REF="039134_0179_1013B148A7B35868">
in the adjoining rooms, mu&s;t be abridged, as &s;he might become the object of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>JULIA was grieved at this prohibition, but &s;ubmitted to it in &s;ilence; two gloomy days were pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ad reflection upon the fate of LEONORA, intermixed with anxiety for her own; &s;he &s;aw no one, but PHILADA, who told her that the Marquis and Count had expected to hear of the death of LEONORA for &s;everal weeks, and had &s;everal days previous to that event, &s;ent down their directions, by a confidential &s;ervant of the Count's, as a &s;py, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed upon her, which had obliged her to abridge her liberty.</P>
<P>JULIA now learned that the funeral of LEO|NORA, was to be the following day, and that her remains were to be interred in the tomb, that &s;he could &s;ee from her window, and was but a few paces from the Chatteau; &s;he was not &s;orry, that &s;he could have an opportunity of &s;eeing the la&s;t re&s;pect that was paid her, and when &s;he beheld the funeral proce&s;&s;ion begin to move; beheld the coffin &s;upported by &s;ix men, and followed by all the &s;ervants and dependants of this domain; as &s;he looked upon it and reflected, that in that &s;mall and narrow compa&s;s, were contained every thing, that remained of LEONORA; who&s;e en|larged &s;oul and generous heart, enlightened by love, and dictated by a noble confidence, had found a convent too &s;mall to contain her; who had with hurried &s;teps and a throbbing heart, travelled from one kingdom, to another, was now going peaceably, and privately, in&s;en&s;ible to that domain, who&s;e doors would &s;oon clo&s;e upon her forever.</P>
<P>When &s;he &s;aw her followed by a train of igno|rant
<PB N="184" REF="039134_0180_1013B14B7A960430">
pea&s;antry, without friend or relation, &s;he could not help looking back to the hours when &s;he and her &s;i&s;ters, were nur&s;ed by the affection of her fond parents, in the very bo&s;om of elegance, ea&s;e and affluence; when their wi&s;hes were prevented by fruition; when every attention was paid to their education; &s;he thought of the hope then entertained; and &s;ighed to reflect upon their di&s;|appointed hopes, unhappy life, and untimely end: Oh! Said &s;he, could they have looked forward, and &s;een them thus bla&s;ted, how wretched it would have made their lives; how would it have added &s;tings, even to the pangs of death. What a moral may be drawn from the fate of the&s;e love|ly, unfortunate women; how little does the fond parent know, while triumphing in the ripening beauties of a &s;miling infant offspring; for what they are pre&s;erved; Oh added &s;he, recurring to her own &s;ad, de&s;olate &s;tate; could mine, though poor and humble, have known to what a &s;ituation their JULIA would be left, and to what dangers expo&s;ed, they would have wi&s;hed them&s;elves childle&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;he pur&s;ued the&s;e melancholy reflections, the proce&s;&s;ion arrived at the place of its de&s;tina|tion; the coffin was carried in; the bearers re|turned from the tomb; and its ponderous jaws, were clo&s;ed upon the remains of LEONORA.</P>
<P>JULIA had a &s;trange curio&s;ity, to vi&s;it the tomb; &s;he had never &s;een one; a pre-&s;entiment told her &s;he &s;hould re&s;t in that; and &s;he had this &s;trange wi&s;h &s;o much at heart, that when PHILADA, brought up her &s;upper, &s;he mention|ed it to her; I have a great curio&s;ity, PHILADA, &s;aid &s;he, could not you contrive to gratify it.&mdash;
<PB N="185" REF="039134_0181_1013B14E437F10B8">
LORD ble&s;s you Madamoi&s;elle, what a &s;trange reque&s;t, you make; I would not go into it for the world. Well, &s;aid JULIA, let me go in a|lone, and do you keep watch without. Ah, Ma|damoi&s;elle, if once I did that, you would never return to the Chatteau, and I and mine &s;hould be undone forever. No PHILADA, cried JULIA, I &s;hould &s;corn a conduct like that; I wi&s;h to leave this place, indeed; but I would rather run every ri&s;que of threatened danger, and at la&s;t die in it; than involve any one in ruin, or do a thing, that would bring any bad con&s;equences upon you; only let me vi&s;it that tomb, and I promi&s;e you upon my honor that I will return. I &s;hould be glad to oblige you, &s;aid PHILADA, but I could not open it, to &s;ave both our lives; my &s;on has the key, and could not go in the day time; and LORD have mercy upon us; who would go to vi&s;it the dead at night? That would be the very time, I &s;hould like to go; your &s;on has the key; I am &s;ure he will go with us. Here PHILADA, give your &s;on this guinea, and a&s;k him to go with us to night. No, I thank you, Madamoi&s;elle, LORD ble&s;s you, what go in|to a &s;epulchre, the very night after a dead body was put into it; why I &s;hould think, I &s;aw the Seignora's gho&s;t all the time. Indeed PHILADA, &s;aid JULIA, there is no &s;uch thing as a gho&s;t.&mdash;But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> you are reluctant to night, let it be tomor|row night; &s;peak of it to your &s;on; con&s;ult with him re&s;pecting it; he will go with me, if you are unwilling. Well, Madamoi&s;elle, I will think of it; but I do not think it will ever do. JULIA, thus encouraged; made her take the money, and the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable vi&s;ions floated upon her fancy till morning.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="039134_0182_1013B14FC5546910">
It was early when PHILADA came to her chamber; well PHILADA, &s;aid JULIA, the mo|ment &s;he &s;aw her, what does your &s;on &s;ay to the reque&s;t I made you? Have you &s;een him? I have, returned PHILADA, and he is ready to obey you; but I am afraid to venture. Of what can you be afraid? di&s;mi&s;s it, I beg of you, and this once oblige me. Why Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid PHI|LADA, the good Marchione&s;s, that I loved &s;o well, lays there; the la&s;t time I was in&s;ide that tomb, was to &s;ee her placed there, and my heart trembles within me, when I think of going again, but you are &s;o much like her, and &s;o urgent, that I will go with you; only you &s;hall promi&s;e not to attempt to e&s;cape from me. I do promi&s;e, &s;aid JULIA, I will not leave you; even if an op|portunity &s;hould offer; I will return back, to my chamber.</P>
<P>PHILADA then agreed to call upon her at e|leven, and that her &s;on &s;hould be waiting for them, at the garden gate.</P>
<P>All day Julia &s;pent in anticipating the vi&s;it of the night, and though &s;ome chilling reflections came over her, yet her heart did not mi&s;give her; when &s;he thought of entering the receptacle of the dead; and when it began to grow dark, &s;he waited with extreme impatience, though indeed it was mingled with fear, for the &s;triking of the clock. It had but ju&s;t announced the hour, when PHILADA, faithful to her promi&s;e, knocked at the door, &s;he entered with, it is &s;o &s;tormy Madam|oi&s;elle, that I was thinking you had better not go, to night. Julia a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he did not value the &s;torm, and ob&s;erved they &s;hould be le&s;s likely to be &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="039134_0183_1013B1529C25BFE0">
When Philada found her determined, &s;he de&s;ired her to follow her; we mu&s;t &s;aid &s;he, go through the Seignora's apartments; her attend|ants have left the Chatteau, to day, and we &s;hall run le&s;s ri&s;que of a di&s;covery; PHILADA led the way, and Julia followed; they pa&s;&s;ed thro' the chamber, in which &s;he had vi&s;ited the late inhabitant, when dying; as &s;he went by the bed, &s;he &s;huddered, and PHILADA trembled &s;o, that &s;he could &s;carcely &s;tand; &s;he took hold of Julia's arm involuntarily, and went on; when arriv|ed at the bottom of the &s;tairca&s;e, &s;he left the candle and took a &s;mall lantern, that was al|ready lighted; I think, Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid &s;he, in a whi&s;per, you had better take the candle; this gives but a dim light; and if the candle is put out, by the wind, we can light it again, for it is very dark, where we are going. Julia did as &s;he was reque&s;ted, and immediately the great door, that led into the court yard, was opened; as &s;he had not felt the fre&s;h air for a week, tho' the howling of a thunder &s;torm &s;truck her ears, yet it was not wholly unplea&s;ant to her; the walls were high, and almo&s;t &s;urrounded by different buildings, &s;o that in cro&s;&s;ing the court, &s;he felt no inconvenience from it, and indeed &s;he paid no attention to it. But when they came to a little gate, at the further end, it blew full in their faces, and in a moment extingui&s;hed the candle &s;he car|ried in her hand; the lantern of Philada only gave light enough to render the darkne&s;s vi&s;ible; it could hardly be called a guide; &s;he now gave it to Jaques, and by the advice of Julia took hold of his arm. I thought as how, &s;aid Jaques, that you were not coming. Philada replied,
<PB N="188" REF="039134_0184_1013B15588F37548">
&s;he had done all &s;he could to per&s;uade Julia out of the notion of it, but finding her &s;o bent upon it, &s;he had come with her; ju&s;t at that in|&s;tant a violent clap of thunder, &s;eemed to &s;hake the firmament; Philada exclaimed, and Ju|lia endeavored to a&s;&s;uage her fears; a violent fla&s;h of lightning followed, and the hail and rain were driven by the wind full upon them. LORD have mercy, &s;aid Philada, if I ever get back to the Chatteau alive again, you will never catch me out&s;ide the doors at night. Certainly, &s;aid Julia, we are as &s;afe here, as in the Chatteau, not quite &s;o comfortable perhaps; but it will be but a few minutes, and I do not mind it at all. Nor I, &s;aid Jaques; I wi&s;h mother was not quite &s;o fraid. I cannot help it, &s;aid Philada; Oh mercy, what a clap was there! Dear PHI|lada, cried Julia, do not be &s;o alarmed, we are as perfectly &s;afe here, as we could be in our cham|bers; every fla&s;h is commi&s;&s;ioned by the Al|mighty, and it cannot harm us, except by his ex|pre&s;s command. But, replied Philada, we have no bu&s;ine&s;s here, &s;earching tombs in the night; and I am &s;ure no good can come of it. The young woman has paid me well, mother, &s;aid Jaques; and I will &s;earch the tombs every night, for the next year, for a good Engli&s;h guinea; it is my bu|&s;ine&s;s, and I am no more afraid, than I &s;hould be at home in my bed. By this time, directed by the faint light, and white pailing, they arrived at the tomb, Jaques applied the key to the door, and with an har&s;h grating &s;ound it opened.&mdash;When Julia looked into this man&s;ion of death, a kind of chilling horror, &s;eemed to pervade her whole frame, and congeal her blood; but for
<PB N="189" REF="039134_0185_1013B1596F7DDA28">
&s;hame, &s;he would have turned back; but &s;he ventured in, and Philada holding by the arm of her &s;on, followed. Jaques was quite undaunt|ed, and Julia with a trembling hand, lit the candle, it was large, and wax, and the bright light of that added to the glare of the lantern, which was now open, illuminated the tomb &s;o that eve|ry object was di&s;cernable.</P>
<P>Julia looked in with a mixture of fear, awe, and &s;atisfaction; and as &s;he ca&s;t her eyes upon a row of coffins that were placed upon a &s;helf of black marble, heaved one &s;igh, for what they con|tained. Philada was &s;o much affected, that &s;he &s;at down upon a marble that was low, and unoccupied, &s;he held the candle in one hand, and re&s;ting her head upon the other; Jaques offer|ed to tell Julia to whom they all belonged; for though they have been put there before I came to the Chatteau; yet I know them all; for I was employed to keep them all clean and in repair. I will accept your offer, &s;aid Julia, and pay you for your trouble; Jaques a&s;&s;ured her he was al|ready paid, and taking the candle, began to give her the information &s;he wi&s;hed; tho&s;e two rich coffins &s;o covered with gold, and &s;ilver, are the old Count and Counte&s;s de Launa; they are long &s;ince turned to a&s;hes; nothing but bones remain; yet &s;ee how clean and bright they are. Julia viewed them, &s;he read upon the plates that adorned the lids, their names titles, fortunes and virtues. Alas, &s;aid Julia, of how little real value is their titles, and e&s;tates; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one who di&s;graces the one, and di&s;honors the other; and their virtues are only owned by di&s;tant branch|es of their family; no trace is to be found in their
<PB N="190" REF="039134_0186_1013B15AF213D300">
immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or, of one virtue; to this we mu&s;t all come, and &s;he turned again to Jaques. This, Madamoi&s;elle, was the Count De Launa; their &s;on, from what I have heard of him, he was good, for he was greatly beloved. This then, &s;aid Julia, contains what was once the hu&s;band of my benefactre&s;s; the man who&s;e worth &s;he &s;till reveres; who&s;e memory &s;he loves, and who&s;e lo&s;s &s;he laments. Her thoughts glanced upon OR|MOND, and &s;he turned to another. This was the mother of my Lord, &s;aid Jaques, and the&s;e little coffins contain &s;ome children, that belonged to the family; and here is the Seignora that was interred ye&s;terday, I would not open it Madam|oi&s;elle, (for &s;he put her hand upon it,) for I am &s;ure, it is offen&s;ive. Julia withdrew her hand, poor Seignora, &s;ighed &s;he, at la&s;t you are at peace; for "here the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and here the weary are at re&s;t." The la&s;t tears are wiped from your eyes, you have breathed your la&s;t &s;igh, rea&s;on no more de&s;erts you; a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of frailty no more afflicts you, your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are all forgiven, and your wounded bo&s;om healed by the hand of a pitying Redeem|er. She turned from this to a coffin that &s;tood a little apart from the re&s;t, it was &s;till covered by a velvet pall, fringed with gold, that &s;aid Jaques was the lady that my poor mother laments &s;o much; that was the la&s;t Marchione&s;s; (Julia went clo&s;e to it), I can open it, Madamoi&s;elle, if you wi&s;h it. If, cried Julia, the gratification of my curio&s;ity, would not too much affect your mother, I &s;hould like to &s;ee what remains of her. I will &s;ee her too, &s;aid Philada, for I always loved

her, and am not afraid of her. JULIA was plea&s;|ed at PHILADA's re&s;olution, and offered her arm to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; and JAQUES opened the lid and turned down the rich white &s;atin, with which the face was covered, and PHILADA exclaimed, Oh, Madamoi&s;elle, what a dreadful thing is death, and who would have &s;uppo&s;ed this to be my dear lady, and yet, &s;aid JULIA, I am &s;urpriz|ed, to find it &s;o intire: I thought indeed that laying twenty years, in this damp place, would have de&s;troyed every ve&s;tige of a face, and yet ever feature remains, only the tincture of the complexion is changed. I have heard, &s;aid JA|QUES, that its pre&s;ervation is owing, to the rich &s;pices and aromatics, that the Count DE LAUNA, had put in the coffin; JULIA now examined it with a kind of intere&s;ted curio&s;ity; look PHILA|DA, &s;aid &s;he, the crimping is not out of the lin|en. That very linen, &s;aid PHILADA, I did up, and crimped for her; I mended too a little rend I had made in that rich lace, when I carried it to her; I little thought it would be her burial clothes, I &s;hall never forget her manner. PHILADA, &s;aid &s;he, you take too much pains; you will wear your|&s;elf out, with your cares; and then &s;he took &s;ome nice lawn from her drawer; here, PHILADA, &s;aid &s;he, (in a kind gentle voice ju&s;t like your own Madamoi&s;elle,) have that made up for a holiday &s;uit; dear lady, it was the la&s;t pre&s;ent &s;he ever made me; and it is as good as new now. That ribbon too that is about the cap was brought down to ornament her baby linen; I tyed up that bow my&s;elf, it was a true lover's knot, Madamoi&s;elle, &s;ee the coronet is worked in gold upon the ends of it. I have heard, &s;aid JULIA, that hair grows

after people are dead, I think it mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, for &s;urely &s;uch a quantity would not have been left to &s;hade the face; O, &s;aid Philada, my la|dy had a great deal to be &s;ure, but it has grown; I wi&s;h, added &s;he, in a trembling voice; I wi&s;h I had a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k of it. Your wi&s;h can ea&s;ily be grati|fied, for &s;urely it ari&s;es from affection, and mu&s;t be innocent, (&s;aid JULIA,) and it cannot be criminal in JULIA, to take off a lock with my &s;ci&s;&s;ors. Philada wept as irre&s;olute; what a dreadful thing, is death &s;aid &s;he! I &s;hudder at it! and I, &s;aid JULIA, regard it as a ble&s;&s;ing, far from con&s;idering it a dreadful thing; I look up|on it as the only &s;olace for affliction, and wi&s;h that my own aching heart, were forever inclo&s;ed within this peaceful man&s;ion; &s;he &s;ighed deep|ly, as &s;he &s;pake, and JULIA, propo&s;ed to return to the Chatteau, as they had been ab&s;ent near an hour. JULIA produced her &s;ci&s;&s;ors, but JAQUES could not u&s;e them; and anxious to gratify Philada, a&s;&s;umed courage to do it her&s;elf; Jaques took the candle, and Philada held the lanthorn; and JULIA &s;tooped to cut off the lock of hair, &s;he looked around the tomb, &s;he a&s;ked her heart if it was &s;acrilege, if &s;he was doing wrong? but con&s;cience an&s;wered in the negative, and &s;he was proceeding; &s;he had ju&s;t touched the hair, when the &s;tillne&s;s that pervaded the gloomy man&s;ion was interrupted by a deep &s;igh; and JULIA &s;tarted, touched the face, to her hor|ror it &s;unk into a&s;hes, and mouldered into du&s;t; not a feature remained; it was all an horrid cha&s;m, for the affrighted imagination to fill up. Julia was petrified; don't be &s;cared, Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid Julia, it is only the pre&s;&s;ure of the air, effected it.
<PB N="193" REF="039134_0189_10136EB3A8134318">
Philada turned almo&s;t fainting from the coffin; and JULIA's trembling and palene&s;s, declared her emotion; Jaques pulled up the &s;atin covering, but before he could clo&s;e the lid, &s;he ca&s;t a fearful glance around the tomb, and at a di&s;tant part of it, thought &s;he di&s;covered a man; Philada &s;aw it at the &s;ame time, and the lantern dropped from her hand, &s;he fell almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground; the &s;ight JULIA, had witne&s;&s;ed deprived her of the power of looking, and almo&s;t of breathing; &s;he &s;tooped, but could give no &s;uccor to Phila|da; who in a low and grieved tone of voice, de|clared &s;he had &s;een a gho&s;t; Jaques helped his mother up, and though very courageous, was doubtful as to the nature of what he had &s;een; and aided her out of the tomb; but the in&s;tant the air met the candle, it was extingui&s;hed, the light in the lantern was put out by the fall, and they were now in intire darkne&s;s, except the fre|quent and awful fla&s;hes of vivid lightning; the thunder too rolled over their heads, the winds howled as an&s;wering, and the rain beat with a|mazing violence. This war of elements however in &s;ome mea&s;ure recalled the &s;cattered &s;en&s;es of Philada, and &s;he exerted her&s;elf to walk be|tween Jaques, and JULIA; who was more terri|fied than &s;he had ever been before, yet &s;he en|deavored to in&s;pire Philada, with a pre&s;ence of mind, that &s;he her&s;elf wanted. It was with &s;ome difficulty they reached the Chatteau, and Jaques helped them to JULIA's room; a candle was burning upon her table, and the moment they entered, Philada &s;unk into a chair; and JULIA out of breath with her exertions, and terrified be|yond her power of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;et down and found
<PB N="194" REF="039134_0190_1013B165DACC69A0">
her&s;elf unable to move. Jaques went to his mo|ther's chamber and returned with a bottle and gla&s;s, and JULIA readily con&s;ented to drink &s;ome wine; after Philada had taken a gla&s;s; they were &s;o much refre&s;hed, that Jaques left them, and in a few minutes Philada declared her&s;elf unable to get to her own room, and &s;aid, for the world &s;he would not lay alone. JULIA readily offered part of her bed, which was accepted with gratitude; but notwith&s;tanding their clothes were cold, and wet, it was &s;ome time before they could undre&s;s. Philada, &s;aid JULIA, did you &s;uppo&s;e that any one, but our&s;elves was in the tomb. Dear Ma|damoi&s;elle, there was not any other per&s;on there, it was an apparition, I &s;aw it as well as you, and knew who it was; I have heard the Chatteau was haunted before; but never was &s;ure of it until now. Who did you &s;uppo&s;e it to be, &s;aid JU|LIA. I cannot think, but it was &s;ome per&s;on who followed us into the tomb. Oh, no, no, &s;aid Philada, it was no living per&s;on, it was the Lord HENRY ORMOND, he died ten years ago; that killed the Count DE LAUNA; I am &s;ure it was he, for I have &s;een him, an hundred times when he was at the Marquis'; he u&s;ed to vi&s;it at the Count's, and I knew him at the fir&s;t &s;ight of him; why, I looked upon him a minute, before I had &s;trength to fall down. I was &s;hocked, &s;aid JULIA, at the dreadful change in the Mar|chione&s;s; but I do not think what we &s;aw, was any thing &s;upernatural; it might be the &s;hade of &s;omething we had not noticed before; and our imaginations were &s;o much affected, that we &s;up|po&s;ed it more terrible, than it really was.</P>

her terrors, Philada got to &s;leep, long before JULIA; for a very painful idea, was &s;ugge&s;ted to her mind, that her fortitude could not overcome, and that &s;he did not chu&s;e to mention. She thought upon recollection, that the figure &s;he had &s;een re&s;embled COLWORT; the ob&s;ervation Philada had made of it's being young ORMOND, confirmed her in the thought; for the Counte&s;s had often remarked, that COLWORT, bore a &s;triking likene&s;s to her fir&s;t lover. This was the time he was expected in France. She now fanci|ed him dead, and that what &s;he had &s;een was his apparition. Thus &s;uper&s;tition, with all its train of evils, entered a mind, that had hitherto been freed from its influence: but her natural good &s;en&s;e, aided by the books &s;he had read, and the remarks of the which &s;he now recollected, &s;oon in &s;ome mea&s;ure overcome it, and the cheer|ing light of the &s;un, which now aro&s;e in bright|e&s;t maje&s;ty, helped to di&s;pel the fears of the night; yet when &s;he reflected upon the gloomy &s;cene, and upon the &s;udden change of the Marchione&s;s; &s;he again experienced her former terrors; and did not wonder that her imagination had become im|pregnated by &s;uper&s;tition; &s;he endeavored to combat her fears, by hopes that COLWORT was &s;till living; and that the Counte&s;s would di&s;|cover, and re&s;cue him from the machinations of the Count.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE courage of Jaques, his good &s;en&s;e and hone&s;t open countenance, &s;ugge&s;ted to her an idea, that he could aid her e&s;cape; hope began again to flatter her, and &s;he was impatient, until &s;he could put her plan into execution. She de|&s;ired Philada, as &s;oon as &s;he awoke from a di&s;|turbed &s;leep, to reque&s;t Jaques to come to her; I want to a&s;k him &s;ome que&s;tions, and have be|&s;ides a favor to a&s;k him. Philada promi&s;ed to &s;end him, but my dear Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid &s;he, you mu&s;t promi&s;e me never more to a&s;k me, to go into a tomb again; &s;o do not a&s;k it; for I never will go. I never will, &s;aid JULIA, I paid too dear for the gratification of my curi|o&s;ity la&s;t night, ever to repeat it. When left alone, her mind again recurred to the tran&s;|action of the preceding evening; and &s;he endea|vored to think, &s;ome per&s;ons had watched their motions, and perhaps were hid in the tomb, for the purpo&s;e of robbing the dead, of &s;ome of the valuable articles about them; but this thought was &s;o much to the di&s;honour of her &s;pecies, and
<PB N="197" REF="039134_0193_1013B16F690EE8F8">
&s;o repugnant to her heart, that &s;he could not give it a moment's continuance. When Philada re|turned with her breakfa&s;t, &s;he was &s;orry to hear that Jaques, was gone to a village, near three leagues di&s;tant, and would not return until the following night, as he went upon bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tewards, which would detain him until that time.</P>
<P>She felt di&s;appointed at this intelligence, and the idea of &s;pending this day alone in her cham|ber, was &s;o irk&s;ome to her, that &s;he reque&s;ted Philada, to indulge her, with walking upon the terrace, and the adjoining rooms; this reque&s;t was granted, and &s;he immediately a&s;cended the former place, to enjoy the free air, and charming pro&s;pect. She tarried &s;everal hours, and upon her return, vi&s;ited the chambers of LEONORA; every thing remained as &s;he had &s;een them, but upon opening a &s;mall clo&s;et, &s;he was gratified to find a &s;mall writing de&s;k, with every material for writing; &s;he did not &s;cruple, to take &s;ome paper, pens, ink and wafers; with the&s;e, &s;he left the&s;e melancholy apartments, and returned to her own room.</P>
<P>She now &s;at down, and wrote a letter to the Counte&s;s; as &s;he did not doubt, &s;he &s;hould pre|vail on Jaques, to carry it; this &s;eemed to a|mu&s;e and employ &s;ome of her time, and when evening was come, hopes of its &s;ucce&s;s had &s;hed &s;o plea&s;ing an influence upon her mind, that not|with&s;tanding her di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, &s;he &s;lept &s;oundly, and awoke refre&s;hed.</P>
<P>She found upon enquiries, that Jaques would not be back until night, and Philada promi&s;ed &s;he would bring him up to her, as &s;oon as he had
<PB N="198" REF="039134_0194_1013B1720F1A9B90">
delivered his me&s;&s;ages to the &s;teward; &s;he now took a book, and once more a&s;cended the terrace; but &s;he had not been there long, when lifting up her eyes to behold the beautiful appearance of the &s;urrounding hills, &s;he &s;aw &s;everal carriages, and men on hor&s;eback; at fir&s;t &s;he thought they were going by; and how ardently did &s;he wi&s;h &s;he was flying with them, from her hated pri&s;on; but they turned a &s;udden angle in the road, and came directly to the Chatteau; in a moment &s;he conceived it was the Count, and his a&s;&s;ociates, and her trembling limbs could &s;carce &s;upport her; &s;he left the terrace, and &s;hut her&s;elf in her cham|ber, as if &s;he was more &s;ecure; or that a &s;ingle bolt could avail any thing again&s;t her oppre&s;&s;or; &s;he went immediately to the window, and there ob&s;erved the carriages enter the Count's yard, and wheel round to the other part of the Chatteau, followed by the Chevaliers on hor&s;eback. She could &s;ee no more of them; though the noi&s;e they made at their entrance, &s;he di&s;tinctly heard.</P>
<P>When &s;he recollected her own weak defen&s;ele&s;s &s;tate, and the power and &s;trength of the Count; her confidence for&s;ook her, and her tears flowed apace, until reflection told her, to tru&s;t in him, who is the protector and friend of the orphan, and tho&s;e who confide in him. She prayed with that genuine piety, which exi&s;ts in the bo&s;om of innocence; and her confidence increa&s;ed; her courage returned; and her calmne&s;s once more re&s;umed.</P>
<P>It was late when Philada entered: Ah! Ma|damoi&s;elle, &s;aid &s;he, I was afraid you would think I had forgot you; but we have had &s;o much to do; my Lord is come, with a world of followers;
<PB N="199" REF="039134_0195_1013B1739339A180">
and has ordered &s;uch a dinner for tomorrow, that I &s;hall have to &s;et up half the night, to prepare it. Did he mention me, &s;aid JULIA? Philada repli|ed in the negative; he has brought a lady, with her woman, and has ordered the Seignora's apartment to be prepared for them, and the adjoining cham|ber for him&s;elf. Perhaps he is married, &s;aid JU|LIA, and if &s;o, how happy &s;hall I be? No, &s;aid Philada, I inquired, and found &s;he was a kept mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;he is very hand&s;ome, but &s;he looks ve|ry far from happy. Well, &s;aid JULIA, if &s;he only learns him to forget me, I &s;hall wi&s;h her hap|py; I am &s;ure, I have had no opportunity to &s;peak to my Lord, nor to come to you; but ju&s;t now before they &s;et down to &s;upper, the Count had me called to the hall, and told me he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to me before he went to bed; and bid me wait in his chamber; &s;o I thought I would bring up &s;omething fir&s;t for you; and then return. Do, &s;aid JULIA, let me know, what he &s;ays to you; I have no inclination to eat, and beg you will carry it down again. Dear Madamoi&s;elle, you will be &s;ick, cried Philada, you have eat no|thing for two days; if you will take the refre&s;h|ment I have brought you, I will come up after the Count has di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me, and bring up Jaques who got home an hour ago, and is now with the &s;teward; but if you will not, I will go to my own room, and not &s;ee you until the morning. The promi&s;e and threat prevailed; JULIA a&s;&s;ur|en her, &s;he would try, and animated with the hope, that Jaques would &s;et off with her letter that night; &s;he drank a little wine, and eat &s;ome of PHILADA's delicacies.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="039134_0196_1013B24EA9969758">
It was more than an hour before the hone&s;t creature returned; &s;he then entered with Jaques. Oh, &s;aid JULIA, I am glad to &s;ee you, but tell me, I beg of you, Philada, what did the Count &s;ay of me? Why Madamoi&s;elle, I waited in his chamber for &s;ome time; at la&s;t he come. Well, Philada, &s;ays he, I am glad to &s;ee you; and want to know what you have done with the young woman I &s;ent to you. I told him what chamber you were in, and that you took on &s;adly, and would not be comforted; he &s;aid you were a fool, for that, he did not mean you any harm, and bid me tell you &s;o; and that he &s;hould vi&s;it you tomorrow; he bid me not to mention you to the &s;ervants that came with him; or his gue&s;ts, and to caution the dome&s;tics in the fami|ly not too; he then bid me good night, and I called Jaques, and came directly to you.&mdash;JULIA, thanked her for her information, and then addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Jaques; &s;he offered him her pur&s;e, and all its contents, if he would carry that letter to the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA; &s;he a&s;|&s;ured him of the protection of that lady, and re|pre&s;ented to him her &s;ad, defencele&s;s &s;tate, in &s;uch moving terms, that Jaques at length con&s;ented, but he refu&s;ed her money. If the Counte&s;s will take me into her &s;ervice, &s;aid he, I &s;hall be amply rewarded; if not, I &s;hall be ruined; but the thoughts of having &s;erved you, Madamoi&s;elle, will reward me; the money will do but little good. JULIA forced upon him as much as would defray his expences; and with a thou&s;and charges gave him the letter; the hone&s;t fellow left her with an a&s;&s;urance that he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that very hour.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="039134_0197_1013B17651251578">
It was now near two o'clock, the ill &s;he pre&s;ag|ed from the Counts vi&s;it; the hopes &s;he conceived from Jaque's hone&s;ty, and expedition, filled her mind, with &s;uch a variety of &s;en&s;ations, that &s;he felt no wi&s;h to &s;leep; &s;he did not go to bed, but &s;at down at the window, and lifting up the &s;a&s;h, explored the expanded firmament; the blue ex|pan&s;e and myriads of &s;tars that &s;parkled with &s;oft|ned lu&s;tre; a light vapour had aro&s;e from the vallies beneath; and &s;eemed to &s;kim along the &s;urface of the plain; and hang on the &s;ides of the hills; a gentle zephyr whi&s;pered through the trembling foliage, and ju&s;t moved the tops of the trees, and when towards day, the moon which was in its wane, aro&s;e in the ea&s;t, attended by the morning &s;tar, &s;he lo&s;t her griefs in the con|templation of the weather; &s;uch an enchanting picture of the grandeur of the works of GOD; and of &s;till life was pre&s;ented, as calmed the tumults of her mind, and di&s;po&s;ed her to confidence and re&s;ignation; &s;he beheld the approach of morning, with plea&s;ure; when with a faint light, the ea&s;tern horizon was tinged; until at length the &s;uffu&s;ion of yellow and crim&s;on was di&s;played, and the &s;un emerging from its &s;lumbers aro&s;e, and threw &s;uch a blaze of glory, over all nature, as almo&s;t to dazzle the &s;en&s;es; her reflections were &s;o &s;oothing, &s;o cheering, and agreeable, that recom|mending her&s;elf to him who formed the world, who taught the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, their differ|ent &s;tations, and all their various, but regular ev|olutions; &s;he &s;unk into a quiet &s;leep, that la&s;ted until Philada made her appearance.</P>
<P>The kind creature only came with her break|fa&s;t; for the increa&s;ing cares, and bu&s;ine&s;s of the
<PB N="202" REF="039134_0198_1013B17A4BBA9428">
family claimed her whole time, and attention, and &s;he could only tarry a few minutes.</P>
<P>Scarcely had &s;he left her, when the foot&s;teps of a man were heard, approaching her door; and in a moment the Count made his appearance; JULIA aro&s;e, as he entered, and retired involun|tarily to the remote part of the chamber. He approached her with re&s;pect; good morning, Madamoi&s;elle, &s;aid he, pray take your &s;eat, for I have &s;omething to &s;ay, in vindication of my own conduct, that requires your attention. I am &s;orry, my Lord, (&s;aid JULIA, with &s;pirit) that your conduct to me has been of &s;uch a nature, as to exclude the po&s;&s;ibility of a vindication; but you can command my attention, for I am your pri&s;oner. You are no longer &s;o (he replied) than you prefer confinement; give me your hand and you are from this moment free, the mi&s;tre&s;s of my hou&s;e, my heart, my fortune, the &s;harer of my titles, my honour; I will pre&s;ent you as a daughter to my father; as a niece to my aunt; I &s;aw you, and I loved you; unu&s;ed to controul, I could not bear to give you up quietly, and &s;ee you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another; I have been &s;ucce&s;s|ful in bringing you here, and it now depends up|on your&s;elf, whether you return my affection and become my wife; or ob&s;tinately bent upon your own de&s;truction, you refu&s;e, and are forced to be|&s;tow the&s;e favours, which I had rather receive as the voluntary offerings of your heart. With my heart, &s;aid JULIA, you can have no connec|tion; for before I knew your Lord&s;hip, I had be&s;towed that upon another; but lea&s;t you &s;hould mi&s;take, and &s;uppo&s;e I wi&s;h to withdraw it, I own to your Lord&s;hip I never could have loved, or

e&s;teemed a man, that could act the part you have done; and there is no evil I could encounter &s;o great, as a connection with one, who&s;e conduct I &s;o much and &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly abhor, as I do yours. She pau&s;ed, but as if amazed at her &s;pirit, he did not reply. She proceeded, there is but one way, my Lord, to regain my e&s;teem, to make me wi&s;h you well or happy; re&s;tore me to your aunt; give me my liberty. And do you think (he interrupted) do you think me &s;uch an idiot, af|ter the pains I have taken; attached to you as I am, to act &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent a part; no, I am not &s;uch a fool. He was proceeding, when &s;he interrupted him: Suffer me, my Lord, to a&s;k you one que&s;tion, (&s;aid &s;he,) how can you an&s;wer your conduct to me; to your con&s;cience; how can you an&s;wer to him, who created you; and who can in&s;tantly bid the vital &s;park that now animates your frame to cea&s;e! who with a thought, can deprive you of life, and every thing that renders life dear to you? think my Lord what account you could give, if called upon to give it within a few hours, at that great tribunal, to which you, as well as I, my Lord, mu&s;t appear. You are romantic, cried the Count, and talk of impo&s;&s;ibilities; you are holding up a mere chi|mera which has no exi&s;tence, and cannot affright the truly enlightened mind; it is high time the&s;e bugbears, the mere tricks of cunning, and artful prie&s;tcraft, were era&s;ed from your under&s;tanding: your mind is enlarged; it is capacious; it is &s;u|perior to the&s;e notions that you have imbibed from a low and confined education: where is the tribunal you &s;peak of? it exi&s;ts only in the in|flated imagination of the wild enthu&s;ia&s;t; the

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS &s;oon as JULIA was left alone, &s;he began to reflect upon the con&s;equences of irritat|ing &s;uch a man; a man who had wealth and power on his &s;ide; and who feared neither GOD nor man; who acknowledged no being &s;uperior to him&s;elf; and who impiou&s;ly defied the Di|vine vengeance, by doubting his exi&s;tence. Her anger was weak and imbecile; &s;he had no friend, no protector, except that Being whom the Count had derided, and in whom &s;he had hitherto plac|ed a confidence, in every evil; &s;he felt not her confidence weakened; but &s;he thought it be&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible to gain time. She remembered, that the youthful and beardle&s;s &s;hepherd, had over|come the lofty, and proud Goliah; and &s;he tru&s;ted that &s;he &s;hould not be &s;acrificed, weak, and humble as &s;he was, to this haughty defier of GOD and all that was &s;acred; but &s;he determin|ed to behave with prudence, that even tho&s;e who tru&s;t in worldly prudence might not blame her; in three days, &s;he could rea&s;onably expect, the Counte&s;s warned of her danger, would be on the way to relieve her; and in four &s;he hoped to &s;ee her. She re&s;olved to write a line before the time the Count had pro&s;cribed her, was expir|ed, requiring three more days; if that reque&s;t
<PB N="208" REF="039134_0204_1013B18A7A5C5690">
was granted, &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;afe; if not, her whole reliance, was upon Providence, and as &s;he felt the need of that reliance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he found it in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>One &s;ource of &s;atisfaction was now denied her, that &s;he had before enjoyed; &s;he could no long|er walk upon the terrace, but confined to a gloomy chamber, with no company, but her own reflec|tions; the day &s;eemed long and irk&s;ome; and when the evening arrived, Philada could only &s;pend a few moments with her. By her &s;he learn|ed that the company was increa&s;ed; that the Chatteau was as full as po&s;&s;ible, and that they would the next day celebrate a great fe&s;tival. How wicked (&s;aid &s;he, as Philada locked the door) mu&s;t the a&s;&s;ociates of this man be? how wretched a pro&s;pect have they before them? I will not en|vy them their liberty, their mirth, or their gaiety, for I &s;hould rather, infinitely rather, &s;pend a long life, &s;hut up, in this dreary, chamber, with the hopes I entertain of futurity, and the firm belief of a GOD, than like them enjoy every thing here, and have no hope that is &s;ub&s;tantial, to brighten the pro&s;pects of a future &s;tate.</P>
<P>In the&s;e reflections, &s;he &s;pent that, and the fol|lowing night; and beheld the next approach with a trembling anxiety; two days were expir|ed, and &s;he had not altered her re&s;olution re&s;pect|ing the Count; yet the more &s;he reflected, the more &s;he dreaded enraging him. She therefore wrote him a &s;hort note, reque&s;ting three days more, to con&s;ider of his propo&s;al, and promi&s;ing a final an&s;wer when that time was clap&s;ed. In le&s;s than half an hour Philada returned, and pre|&s;enting her with a &s;trip of paper, &s;he read the fol|lowing words:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This note da&s;hed her hopes intirely, for the Counte&s;s could not grant her any relief &s;o &s;oon; as it was impo&s;&s;ible, for Jaques to have delivered his me&s;&s;age, and returned by that time; &s;he &s;at down on the bed, and giving way to de&s;pair, al|mo&s;t expected he would come this night: She detained Philada with her for &s;ome time, and endeavored to prevail on her to aid her e&s;cape; but the terrors of her weak mind placed &s;o many difficulties in the way, that JULIA could not &s;uc|ceed; and &s;he &s;aw her clo&s;e the door upon her, with a pre&s;age that &s;he never felt before.</P>
<P>She &s;at with her head, re&s;ted upon the ca&s;e|ment, and in a &s;tate of mind that defied the mu|&s;ic of the &s;pheres to &s;oothe, or calm; and thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her eyes were fixed upon the &s;tars, her imagin|ation &s;oared far beyond the&s;e &s;hining luminaries and &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he could lay down a being, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ubjected her to mi&s;eries, doubts and in&s;ult, an commence one free from the&s;e various evil&punc; Ju&s;t then as the clock &s;truck one, and all belo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was &s;till as death, &s;he thought &s;he heard a ru&s;t|ling near her, and in a moment her own nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was di&s;tinctly pronounced by a voice, that vibrat|ed

upon her ear, as Colwort's. The recollection of what &s;he had &s;een in the tomb, now ru&s;hed up|on her mind, and combining his appearance, with the voice; &s;he no longer doubted but he was dead; and that his apparition had now come to give her warning of her approaching fate; una|ble to &s;u&s;tain &s;uch &s;hocking &s;en&s;ations, &s;he fainted and &s;unk upon the floor, it was &s;ome time before &s;he recovered her recollection; and when &s;he did, &s;uch horrid images ru&s;hed upon her mind, that &s;he had nearly relap&s;ed into the &s;ame &s;tate a|gain. After &s;everal exertions, &s;he got to the bed, and there tears came to her relief; for &s;ome time &s;he indulged them, until at length nature wearied out with exertions, &s;he fell into a di&s;|turbed &s;leep; which la&s;ted however, but a &s;hort time. She awoke with the fir&s;t crowing of the cock, and again revolving in her mind the mo&s;t horrid images, &s;he recollected that the cri&s;is of her fate approached, and that fortitude would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to &s;upport her; &s;he endeavored at re&s;ig|nation, and prayed for that &s;upport &s;he needed. As the morning advanced, &s;he became calmer, and when Philada entered with her breakfa&s;t, &s;he had re&s;olution enough to eat &s;omething.</P>
<P>The day, however, was long and tire&s;ome, and when at length the dreaded night come, and no news from the Counte&s;s, no relea&s;e from the Count, not one glimmer of hope entered her gloomy abode to cheer it from without; all her re&s;ources were from within. The hours pa&s;&s;ed on without interruption until eleven, when the door opened, and the Count entered; he &s;tarted at her pale face and languid looks, en|quired for her health, and &s;eated him&s;elf be&s;ide

her. After he&s;itating for a moment, he a&s;ked her with apparent agitation, if &s;he was ready, to give him an an&s;wer. She replied firmly, that &s;he had no an&s;wer to give him; that he knew her mind, and that it had not for one moment he&s;i|tated with re&s;pect to her deci&s;ion. I know I have nothing to expect from your ju&s;tice (&s;aid &s;he) let me claim &s;omething from your pity! it is your mercy, that I now implore to protect me again&s;t your&s;elf; I am defencele&s;s and wretched, I throw my&s;elf upon your protection! Oh &s;ave me from the wor&s;t of evils, and re&s;tore me to my friends; or if that is di&s;plea&s;ing, immure me in a nunnery; confine me to a convent, but do not force me to a connection that my &s;oul abhors!</P>
<P>She was upon her knees before him, and he en|deavored in vain to rai&s;e her. No, never will I ri&s;e, &s;aid, &s;he until you have a&s;&s;ured me of my &s;afety! In my arms (he cried) you will be &s;afe; they &s;hall be your pri&s;on, and I will be your guard, ob&s;ti|nate and ungrateful as you are; I will make you happy, for I love you; and that love &s;hall plead my excu&s;e. He threw his arms around her and attempted to embrace her, but &s;he &s;hrunk, as from the touch of a torpedo, and hardly knowing what &s;he did, called loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At that in&s;tant a violent pu&s;h again&s;t the door forc|ed it open, and &s;ome one exclaimed, turn villain, and defend your&s;elf; the Count turned upon his opponent, and &s;natched his &s;word from the table; &s;everal thru&s;ts pa&s;&s;ed upon both &s;ides, until at length the &s;word of the &s;tranger entered the right arm of the Count; his foot got entangled in the carpet, and he fell with his head again&s;t the po&s;t of the bed&s;ted, and fetching a deep groan, became &s;en&s;ele&s;s.</P>

JULIA had rai&s;ed her&s;elf an anxious witne&s;s, and when her deliverer approached her, &s;he di&s;|covered Colwort; her joy and a&s;toni&s;hment de|prived her of the power of &s;peech, and to his in|treaty, &s;he could only an&s;wer by holding out both her hands. He pre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e hands to his lips, until at length her &s;pirits became re&s;tored, and &s;he begged him to tell her from whence he came; this is no time for enquiries, cried he, do my love exert your&s;elf, that we may leave this dreadful &s;cene; and though he does not de&s;erve it, call &s;ome one to a&s;&s;i&s;t this bad man, for I would not leave him thus; and this man&s;ion is full of his emmi&s;&s;aries. He is gone, (&s;aid JULIA,) as &s;he &s;tooped down; he is gone with all his vices, with all his load of crimes upon his head to ap|pear before an angry GOD.</P>
<P>Colwort thought the &s;ame; but fears for her &s;afety prompted a deceit; he a&s;&s;ured her that the Count was only &s;tunned by the fall, that he would &s;end help the moment he had got her out of doors; thus a&s;&s;ured, &s;he a&s;&s;umed fortitude to leave the chamber, and though &s;he trembled with fear and apprehen&s;ion, yet his pre&s;ence encour|aged her, and with ha&s;ty &s;teps, they gained the &s;tairca&s;e, when they began to de&s;cend, they heard the groans of the Count; this added to their &s;peed, and they were in a moment upon the fir&s;t landing, when a light bur&s;t from a room be|low, and they beheld a lady a&s;cending by the &s;ame &s;tairs; it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid her; or to retreat; they mu&s;t meet, and upon her turn|ing a winding, the candle threw its rays full up|on her face, and in the mid&s;t of her fears and con|fu&s;ion, JULIA di&s;covered Donna Olivia.

Donna Olivia looked up|on them a&s;toni&s;hed; Colwort attempted to pu&s;h by her, but &s;he be&s;ought him to &s;top, and de&s;ir|ed to know where they were going. Colwort enraged at this delay, refu&s;ed an an&s;wer; and JULIA intreated Olivia to let them pa&s;s unmo|le&s;ted. Is it you, Madamoi&s;elle, (&s;aid &s;he,) I wi&s;h not to detain you? I have but ju&s;t di&s;covered you were here, and with the old hou&s;e-keeper have been laying a plan for your e&s;cape.

It was no time for thanks, Colwort informed her of the &s;ituation of the Count, and with an ha&s;ty and agitated &s;tep, &s;he left them, to go to him.</P>
<P>COLWORT and JULIA de&s;cended the &s;tairca&s;e, cro&s;&s;ed the hall, and went into the court where they found hor&s;es, and a &s;ervant who a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;et her on hor&s;eback, and Colwort having mount|ed, they rode off with as much expedition as po&s;|&s;ible; with a &s;peed, that newly acquired &s;pirits, renovated hope, and liberty ju&s;t recovered, lent them.</P>
<P>So quickly had the incidents of the la&s;t half hour &s;ucceeded each other, that JULIA thought it almo&s;t the work of enchantment, and that her deliverance was the bu&s;ine&s;s of fancy, or an airy dream.

before her lover could a&s;&s;ure her of her &s;afe|ty; and enter into a conver&s;ation con&s;i&s;tent or regular. She then reque&s;ted him to inform her, how he got information of her confinement, or what had brought him to her re&s;cue. I will, re|plied he, be as conci&s;e, as po&s;&s;ible, for if the Count &s;hould recover his recollection, his Chatteau is filled with his a&s;&s;ociates, and we may be pur&s;u|ed. It is now three weeks &s;ince I arrived in France; directed by the letters of the Counte&s;s, I &s;et off for Paris, attended only by a faithful &s;ervant, that had accompanied me to America; we were within half a days journey of the capital when we were joined by two per&s;ons, who had the ap|pearance of gentlemen; they &s;oon found, that my vi&s;it was intended to the Counte&s;s DE LAU|NA, they were acquainted with her, and you, and informed me that you had both &s;et out for the Villa three days &s;ince; that the health of Madam DE LAUNA, was &s;o poor, that you had left Paris, the day after your return from Spain. The &s;tory was fea&s;ible, and I became the dupe; I had until then travelled in a public &s;tage, but at the fir&s;t Inn, I ordered hor&s;es, for my&s;elf and &s;ervant, and &s;et out for the Villa; the next day in the afternoon, we were &s;urrounded, by ten men on hor&s;eback, well armed and a carriage at|tending; we defended our&s;elves, for &s;ome time, but were at la&s;t &s;eized, bound, and put into the carriage. In two days I arrived here with my guards, and was immediately led to a pri&s;on; here I continued, near a fortnight, when in exploring the rece&s;&s;es of my dungeon, for &s;uch it might be called, I found a pa&s;&s;age that led to a tomb; I immediately laid a plan to e&s;cape, for I knew
<PB N="215" REF="039134_0211_1013B19C43261B48">
not my tyrant nor the rea&s;on of this confinement. One night, la&s;t week, I &s;aw a light in this recep|tacle of death; I opened the door, that led to it with caution, and to my a&s;toni&s;hment, beheld two women, and a man intently examining a coffin; I immediately formed the de&s;ign of pa&s;&s;|ing them, which I could with ea&s;e, and &s;afety, have done, but curio&s;ity prompted me to exam|ine the faces of the per&s;ons &s;o employed; when I came a little more to the light, I thought in one, I di&s;covered the features and countenance of my JULIA; before I could enough dive&s;t my|&s;elf of &s;urprize, to be a&s;&s;ured of the truth of my conjecture, I was di&s;covered. One of the women fainted, and the light was extingui&s;hed; the fir&s;t impul&s;e of my &s;oul, was to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, for it was indeed your&s;elf. But a &s;entiment that I could not define, withheld me; the tomb was left open, and I left my pri&s;on; I repaired to a neighbour|ing cottage, where I gained much information re&s;pecting the Chatteau, and its inhabitants; I found too, that a lady was confined there. The next day the Count arrived with his friends; I di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf like one of the attendants; and got admittance; as &s;uch I had no fears of being di&s;covered, I had been brought in the night, and &s;ince my arrival had &s;een no one, except the man who brought me my food; and him only by night; my dre&s;s was different, and my di&s;gui&s;e complete. La&s;t night I found your cham|ber door, and called to you by name, but you were a&s;leep or did not hear me. A noi&s;e below obliged me to leave my &s;tation; but to day I pro|cured hor&s;es, to be in waiting, and was deter|mined to re&s;cue you, or peri&s;h in the attempt.

It was &s;urely Heaven that &s;ent me, at that peri|od, when I was &s;o much wanted; and yet, we &s;hould not have effected our e&s;cape, but for the lady, who is, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Count's mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>He ended his narrative, with expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, to that power, who had thus far pro|tected them, and profe&s;&s;ions of a pa&s;&s;ion as tend|er and faithful, as it was &s;incere; and JULIA gave him an account, of every thing, that had happened to her &s;ince he left the Villa. This con|ver&s;ation la&s;ted until morning, and with a heart filled with grateful &s;en&s;ations, JULIA beheld the &s;un ari&s;e. How different were her emotions now; and the la&s;t time &s;he &s;aw it, &s;he remarked this difference to Colwort; who could now view her beautiful, and intere&s;ting face, with rapture; and they enjoyed the mo&s;t &s;ublime plea&s;ures, tho&s;e of mingled gratitude, love and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>As the morning advanced, they entered a little town, and Colwort left his hor&s;es at the fir&s;t Inn they came to, and hired a chai&s;e, for that day's journey, and JULIA purcha&s;ed &s;ome things, that were nece&s;&s;ary, the fear of being overtaken prevent|ed their taking any repo&s;e, and after a &s;light refre&s;h|ment, they &s;at forward to the Villa. When Colwort looked at JULIA and &s;aw her counte|nance animated, though her face was pale, and though her eyes expre&s;&s;ed joy and hope, they were &s;unk and languid; he thought he had nev|er &s;een any thing &s;o beautiful before; he held her hand in his; he pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, and in the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t energetic language expre&s;&s;ed his love, his delight, his hopes, and anticipated joys, of days and years, &s;pent in her dear &s;ociety.</P>
<P>They made long &s;tages, and at night JULIA
<PB N="217" REF="039134_0213_1013B1A1B6954828">
found her&s;elf, &s;o much fatigued, as to be unable to pur&s;ue her journey without repo&s;e; be&s;ides the carriage, was only hired for one day, and was now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, when they &s;topped at a public hou&s;e, and JULIA preferred pa&s;&s;ing the night, at a con|vent, that was in the neighbourhood; Colwort immediately conducted her, and &s;he was agreea|bly &s;urprized, to find when &s;he arrived, it was the &s;ame convent, &s;he had once been entertained at, with the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA; the Abbe&s;&s; and &s;everal of the nuns recognized her, and re|ceived her with plea&s;ure for the night; Colwort was invited to &s;tay to &s;upper, with the &s;uperior, and upon his taking leave, de&s;ired to breakfa&s;t with them the next morning; as he left the parlour, JULIA followed him, with her eyes, and &s;ighed as the door &s;hut him from her view; &s;he was a&s;hamed of the pre-&s;entiment, &s;he was then &s;en&s;i|ble of, and endeavoured to &s;hake it off; after a &s;hort conver&s;ation, the Abbe&s;s conducted her to her chamber; and a bed and repo&s;e were never more welcome to the weary traveller, than they now were to the fatigued and exhau&s;ted girl. But though &s;he wooed with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, the drow&s;y god, it was late, and the convent clock had &s;truck twelve, before he deigned to clo&s;e her eyelids; when &s;he awoke, the &s;un had ri&s;en to a con&s;iderable height, and fearful that &s;he had tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon the rules of the hou&s;e, or made Colwort wait, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf in ha&s;te, and de&s;cended to the parlour.</P>

<Q>"Angui&s;h after rapture, how &s;evere!"</Q>
<BIBL>YOUNG.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AFTER the compliments of the morning, the Abbe&s;s expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urprize, that Col|wort did not make his appearance; &s;he wait|ed half an hour and then &s;ent a &s;ervant to the Inn to enquire for him; he was ab&s;ent but a few minutes, when he returned with the dreadful ac|count, that the young gentleman had been &s;eiz|ed by the officers of ju&s;tice, for the murder of the Count DE LAUNA, and carried to Paris at mid|night.</P>
<P>When JULIA heard this news, a death-like &s;tupor pervaded her &s;en&s;es; &s;he &s;at like a &s;tatue, no tears, no &s;igh, declared her di&s;tre&s;s; her eyes fixt in de&s;pair upon the floor; her hands lifted up, and her whole frame in the attitude of an|gui&s;h, too &s;evere to be expre&s;&s;ed; the Abbe&s;s moved and alarmed at her &s;ituation endeavoured to provoke her tears. After &s;ome time &s;he &s;uc|ceeded, and when her full heart was in &s;ome mea|&s;ure relieved, &s;he informed this benevolent wo|man, of all that had happened to her, and a&s;ked her what &s;he would advi&s;e her to do? I would advi&s;e you, my dear, &s;aid that good lady, to proceed im|mediately to the Villa, inform the Counte&s;s of every circum&s;tance, and you will in&s;ure her in|tere&s;t in favour of Mr. Colwort.</P>
<P>JULIA aro&s;e with &s;pirit, and prepared to act,
<PB N="219" REF="039134_0215_1013B1A71E11E428">
agreeably to the advice, &s;he had received, which indeed agreed with her own &s;entiments; but up|on &s;ending out, no chai&s;e or carriage of any kind was to be procured, for that day; and a gentle|man who lived in the neighbourhood of the Counte&s;s, and was a friend of the Abbe&s;s, heard of what had happened, and as he had bu&s;ine&s;s, a few miles, beyond the Villa, propo&s;ed to carry JULIA to the Counte&s;s, the next morning, if &s;he would put her&s;elf under his protection.</P>
<P>Though &s;he felt extreme reluctance, to tarry another night, from the Villa, and &s;he thought it her duty to take every &s;tep, in her power, to re|lea&s;e her lover immediately, yet &s;he was obliged to &s;ubmit to this delay.</P>
<P>This day was perhaps the longe&s;t of her life, and the mo&s;t painful. Very early the next morn|ing, the gentleman called at the convent; &s;he had been ready a long while, and after taking an affectionate leave, of the worthy Abbe&s;s, and friendly nuns, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf by the &s;ide of Mon&s;ieur Duboit, and began her journey to the, Villa; though this gentleman was &s;en&s;ible, and kind, yet he had not tho&s;e qualities, which could &s;horten the di&s;tance, to a mind &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as her's was; the unfortunate girl after a few at|tempts at conver&s;ation, became &s;ilent, and retir|ing within her&s;elf, found a va&s;t horde of mi&s;ery for her contemplation.</P>
<P>The &s;un had gained his meridian &s;ummit, and &s;he was awoke from her reverie by her com|panion, who pointed out to her the buildings of the Villa; at this cheering &s;ight, hope which had almo&s;t de&s;erted, returned; her bo&s;om became animated, and &s;he anticipated the embraces of
<PB N="220" REF="039134_0216_1013B1AB4B049650">
the Counte&s;s; her exertions in favour of Colwort, and his re&s;toration to liberty; they were now within half a mile of the end of her journey, when they were overtaken by a &s;ervant, who came to inform Mon&s;ieur Duboit, that his eld|e&s;t &s;on had met with a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing accident, and that his immediate pre&s;ence was required. The gentleman became di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and JULIA de&s;ired he would let her alight, as &s;he could with ea&s;e, and plea&s;ure walk the little di&s;tance, in a &s;hort time. She expre&s;&s;ed her &s;orrow for his af|fliction; thanked him for his attention; and he permitted her to get out of the chai&s;e.</P>
<P>She proceeded with alacrity, until &s;he came to the gate, but was &s;urprized, to find it locked; a circum&s;tance that per&s;uaded her, that the Counte&s;s, had not returned, as it was always left open, when &s;he was at home; &s;he rang the bell, and in a few moments &s;aw the porter coming a|cro&s;s the Park.&mdash;Oh Pedro, (&s;aid &s;he,) I am glad to &s;ee you; where is your lady, and how do you all do? We are all well, Madamoi&s;elle (he replied,) my lady is &s;till at Paris. I am &s;orry (cried JU|LIA,) for that, (and &s;he wondered that he did not open the gate,) when do you expect her? We do not know when; but we heard from her ye&s;terday (he &s;aid in a &s;ulkey tone,) and &s;he &s;ent down word, (he added,) and an order, that you &s;hould not be admitted at the Villa; not ad|mitted (&s;aid JULIA,) then I am undone! I cannot help that (cryed he with great indiffer|ence,) you won't enter here, and you had be&s;t leave the gate. Good Heaven, (&s;aid JULIA,) where can I go? And what will become of Col|wort? That is your look out, (&s;aid the brutal
<PB N="221" REF="039134_0217_1013B1ACCC59E550">
fellow,) but I advi&s;e you to leave the gate im|mediately.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the &s;tate of JULIA'S mind at this in&s;tant, but amid&s;t her own de&s;titute and forlorn &s;ituation, the fate of her lover, was uppermo&s;t. The brutality of this man, added ingratitude to his ba&s;ene&s;s, and oc|ca&s;ioned a pang, &s;he had never felt before; a few days before, &s;he had left the Villa, this fellow had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, for &s;ome high mi&s;demeanor; but at the intreaties of JULIA, he had been re|ceived and forgiven; he profe&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t gratitude for her interce&s;&s;ion; and &s;uch was her opinion of the human heart, that &s;he imagined, he would have died to &s;erve her; his conduct o|pened her eyes, and the ha&s;ty retro&s;pect &s;he now took of her &s;hort and unfortunate life, &s;he found many in&s;tances that led her to &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e merits, &s;he had been tenacious in &s;uppo&s;ing inhabited every bo&s;om, were but the vi&s;ionary phantoms of her own imagination, or the garb that veil from mortal ken, the vices or follies of mankind.</P>
<P>She did not however wait for another order to quit the gate, but with a bur&s;ting heart &s;he turn|ed down the country road; &s;he knew not where to go, nor which way to proceed, but walked with hurried &s;teps, until &s;he came to another avenue, that led to the hou&s;e, &s;he had loved &s;o well; a little &s;eat had been rai&s;ed out &s;ide the walk, it was now covered with ja&s;mine, and woodbine; and &s;he remembered how often &s;he had been &s;eated upon it, with the Counte&s;s; &s;he recollected too, for memory now became a cruel and faithful intruder, that the very day before &s;he left that charming retirement, &s;he had read Mil|ton,
<PB N="222" REF="039134_0218_1013B1AE596B08C8">
in Engli&s;h to the Marquis; &s;he recollected that upon that very &s;eat, the Counte&s;s had ex|pre&s;&s;ed her pity for the fir&s;t offender, "and yet (&s;aid &s;he,) &s;he drives me from her pre&s;ence, and &s;ends me out an helple&s;s wanderer, to a world that I do not know, and to which I am a &s;trang|er; I &s;hall never more enter this walk again; never again ta&s;te the plea&s;ure of being beloved by this be&s;t of women, or hearing her in&s;tructions; de&s;erted by the only friend I ever knew; lo&s;t to my wretched lover; an helple&s;s, friendle&s;s orph|an; what will become of me?" As &s;he indulged the&s;e thoughts, a thou&s;and tender recollections ru&s;hed upon her mind, and almo&s;t overpowered her &s;en&s;es: She &s;unk on her knees before the &s;eat and would have prayed, but the hurricane in her bo&s;om, prevented her connecting her ideas. In this &s;ituation, wi&s;hing for death as her only friend, &s;he continued for a &s;hort time; until &s;he was arou&s;ed from this &s;tupor, by a per&s;on who in a &s;weet, per&s;ua&s;ive, but manly voice, begged to know what had reduced her to &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he ju&s;t looked up and waved her hand for him to leave her.&mdash;"What, leave you, (&s;aid he) in this &s;ituation? No, Heaven forbid. Put it in my power, to &s;erve you; let me &s;ee you compo&s;ed, for I cannot leave you." Oh, (&s;aid JULIA) I am wretched and undone; you cannot help me; leave me to that fate that follows me. "No, (replied he) lady, I will not leave you; if you are undone by the frailty of human nature, for who is exempt from frailty, I will pour into your wounded heart the balm and oil of &s;ymphathy, I will a&s;&s;i&s;t your &s;teps to regain the paths of virtue; if you are unhappy by the ba&s;ene&s;s or ingratitude of ano|ther,
<PB N="223" REF="039134_0219_1013B1B220DE90E8">
I will &s;ymphathize with you in all your &s;or|rows, and be a companion in all your griefs; if you have lo&s;t your friends, I and mine will &s;up|ply their place; if you are poor, my fortune is at your command; but de&s;ire me not to leave you." Thank GOD, (&s;aid JULIA,) I have no great error to accu&s;e my&s;elf of; but, I am de&s;erted by my friends; I have, no relations, no fortune; no hou&s;e; no home; and know not where to lay my head. "The Saviour of mankind, the King of all the earth, (cried the &s;tranger,) knew not where to lay his head; I profe&s;s my&s;elf his follower; an humble follower; but a &s;incere believer in him, who died for &s;inners; my religion bids me to a&s;|&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; confide in that re|ligion then; and let me be your protector; un|til we can find one, who better de&s;erves that name." JULIA looked at him, and in his inter|e&s;ting countenance, and intelligent, though plain features, read &s;uch a collection of virtues as al|mo&s;t &s;ilenced every doubt; he &s;poke with all the energy of an hone&s;t, though enthu&s;ia&s;tic heart. She ob&s;erved he had a chai&s;e in waiting; his di|alect, though he &s;poke good French, convinced her he was a foreigner, his tall and manly per&s;on almo&s;t awed her anxiety to peace. Alas, (&s;aid &s;he,) what &s;hall I do? "Let me convey you lady, to a place of ea&s;e, and &s;afety, (he replied,) a few miles from hence lives a country woman of mine; &s;he is the daughter of &s;orrow and has drank all the cup of affliction; misfortune has become fa|miliar to her; but &s;till &s;he pre&s;erves every virtue, and cheri&s;hes every charity. I will carry you to her, and if a doubt &s;till remains, let this remove it. I love and am beloved by one, of the be&s;t of
<PB N="224" REF="039134_0220_1013B1B600723260">
her &s;ex; in a few weeks I &s;hall receive her hand at the altar, as a pledge of la&s;ting happine&s;s; if &s;he is what I think her, &s;he would not receive me with a tran&s;port of ardent welcome, were I capa|ble either of betraying one, who confided in me, or leaving one in di&s;tre&s;s; but if you will not be prevailed upon to go with me, tell me to what a&s;ylum I &s;hall convey you, for &s;ee the &s;un is now verging to his repo&s;e, and I will not leave you."</P>
<P>This la&s;t argument prevailed, and &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be put into the chai&s;e, and the &s;ervant drove off.</P>
<P>This young gentleman was one of tho&s;e few, who at the early age of twenty four was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every virtue; his name was Ro&s;well, he was the elde&s;t &s;on of a worthy man, who cultivated a large unincumbered e&s;tate of his own, in the North of England; he had received all the ad|vantages of a good education; his per&s;on was good; his mind improved; his heart open; his temper frank, and his di&s;po&s;ition benevolent; early in life, he became attached to religion, and wi&s;hed at his quitting college, to take orders im|mediately; but his father who in the la&s;t three years had lo&s;t all his children, thought this the &s;cheme of monki&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, and to divert him from it, had in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that he &s;hould &s;pend four years in France and Italy previous to this &s;tep. This was a great &s;elf denial, to the young man, who knew that the profe&s;&s;ion he wi&s;hed to embrace, did not exclude the &s;ocial charities, innocent plea&s;ures, or real gratifications; he knew that it embraced them all in a mo&s;t exten|&s;ive point of view; for he was &s;ure that a con&s;ci|entious Clergyman was the father of his people,
<PB N="225" REF="039134_0221_1013B1B785446768">
the friend of the poor, and the protector of all the children of &s;orrow; be&s;ides he had with extreme avidity from his childhood cultivated an acquaint|ance with a lovely little orphan, who was left un|der the protection of his father; in mind and &s;en|timent alike, they loved their own virtues in each other; early accu&s;tomed to love each other, &s;e|paration was to them the greate&s;t afflicton, and to meet, the greate&s;t joy they were capable of ta&s;ting, they both di&s;covered, while very young, that their happine&s;s would con&s;i&s;t in living for each other, and when Ro&s;well acknowledged his attachment, the blu&s;hing Lucretia, owned a &s;imilar affection.</P>
<P>His father had long known the virtues of this charming girl, he approved his &s;on's choice, and engaged that in four years, Lucretia &s;hould be his; Lucretia had prided her&s;elf upon her penetration for &s;he had at a very early age di&s;covered tho&s;e qualities, that now began to mature; and &s;he not only loved but reverenced them; painful was the idea of four years' ab&s;ence, yet when Ro&s;well knew, that Lucretia was to be the &s;ure, and am|ple reward of his obedience, he entered upon it with as much avidity, as the patriarch did, when he began his &s;even years &s;ervitude for the beaute|ous Rachel. And this attachment was perhaps nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve a youth of his fire and en|ergy, from the vices and follies with which he was &s;urrounded. Half the term of probation was e|lap&s;ed, when he was &s;ummoned home upon a melancholy errand; to clo&s;e the eyes of his fa|ther, and comfort a widowed mother, was the of|fice that was a&s;&s;igned him; and he undertook it with re&s;igned alacrity. But when he arrived in England, the lamp of life was not &s;o far extin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="226" REF="039134_0222_1013B1BB7A87D360">
in the father, but that he beheld his &s;on's improvements with plea&s;ure, and fondly anticipat|ed that period when the talents and genius of Ro&s;|well, expanded by the hand of time, would a&s;ton|i&s;h as well as better mankind; this idea pur&s;ued him in his dying moments, and ambitious for ev|ery improvement, he conjured his &s;on to contin|ue his travels, for two years longer before he &s;et|tled in life.</P>
<P>Young Ro&s;well would, to &s;ooth and comfort a dying parent, have promi&s;ed any thing, within the verge of po&s;&s;ibility, and a few weeks after his decea&s;e, left his native country, and returned to France; there with an heart full of his mother, and his Lucretia, he pur&s;ued every &s;tudy that was either u&s;eful, or ornamental, and practiced every virtue that can do honor to human nature. His term of probation was nearly expired, and he meant to &s;pend the la&s;t &s;ix weeks in France, with an old lady, that he reverenced and &s;upport|ed; this was the time of his meeting JULIA.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time after they had commenced their little journey; lo&s;t in grief, wonder and fear, unaccompanied by hope, &s;he rode &s;everal miles without &s;peaking, and Mr. Ro&s;well was too well acquainted with the human heart to interrupt this &s;ilence; he knew by experience, that com|fort comes in vain, that comes too &s;oon; and he forbore one word either of &s;ympathy, or remark; &s;atisfied that he was performing a benevolent ac|tion; he was laying plans to be &s;till more u&s;eful, and anticipating a plea&s;ing reward he &s;hould meet with in his Lucretia's augmented love; more than half their little ride was performed, when he began a conver&s;ation by &s;ome remarks
<PB N="227" REF="039134_0223_1013B1BD003A2E88">
upon the twilight, that were &s;o much like what &s;he had heard drop from the lips of Colwort, that they occa&s;ioned a deep &s;igh, and after a few moments &s;ilence, &s;he a&s;ked him his country; when informed that he was an Engli&s;hman, &s;he felt &s;omething like the revival of tho&s;e hopes, that had been &s;o cruelly bla&s;ted at the Villa; Do you know a young gentleman of your coun|try, by the name of Francis COLWORT, &s;he in|quired? "Only by report (he returned;) pray what of him?" Oh, (&s;aid JULIA) he is mi&s;erable, and I am the wretched cau&s;e; when I found you were his countryman, I did not know, I was &s;o fooli&s;h as to admit hope. "Hope, (&s;aid he) entertain it &s;till; it is a delightful vi&s;itor; make it &s;o wel|come that it become a con&s;tant inhabitant of your bo&s;om." Alas! &s;aid JULIA, my fate has been &s;o wayward, that it almo&s;t totally excludes the charming vi&s;itant. "When you can without re|newed pain, young lady, favour me with a recit|al of your &s;orrows, you will oblige me, and per|haps, put it in my power to &s;erve you; but un|le&s;s that can be done without the &s;acrifice of a moment's quiet, I will not a&s;k the plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>JULIA in a frank, and conci&s;e manner, inform|ed him of the events of her life, and her real &s;it|uation, and in the cour&s;e of her little narrative, di&s;covered &s;o much good &s;en&s;e, and &s;o much re|al merit, as in&s;ured her the admiration, as well as e&s;teem of Ro&s;well. He a&s;&s;ured her, that he would the very next day, take active mea&s;ures in behalf of COLWORT, and &s;ee the Counte&s;s, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, as he was &s;ure, &s;he had been im|po&s;ed upon; in the mean time, he begged her
<PB N="228" REF="039134_0224_1013B1BFC2485DA8">
to be ea&s;y&punc; and again a&s;&s;ured her of the comfort and honor of the place &s;he was going to.</P>
<P>Few Engli&s;hmen were better qualified, than Mr. Ro&s;well, for this undertaking; he had been in France &s;o long, that he was well acquainted with its laws, cu&s;toms, and manners; but his temper was &s;o &s;anguine, that he always looked upon the bright &s;ide of every picture, and he doubted not of his &s;ucce&s;s in &s;pite of the Ba&s;tile, which fancy had conjured up to torture him; but he carefully avoided to mention his fears, and only &s;pake of hope; his conver&s;ation, was &s;uch a combination of good &s;en&s;e, genius, and &s;olid piety, that every word he &s;pake was full of con&s;olation; it calmed the tumults of her troub|led mind, and &s;oothed her into peace.</P>
<P>It was near ten o'clock, at right, when they arrived at a little, neat man&s;ion, that &s;tood in the &s;uburbs of a village, he lifted her from the car|riage, and with every expre&s;&s;ion of comfort, led her into the hou&s;e; here they were met by a ven|erable woman, who had counted more than &s;ev|enty years. "My good Madam, (cried Ro&s;well,) how do you do? Here I have brought you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> charming companion: &s;he is unhappy, you mu&s;t teach her to be otherways." I think (&s;aid the old lady,) &s;he mu&s;t be good, as you recommend her; I will endeavour to render her cheerful, at lea&s;t." She conducted them into a little parlour, and tho' &s;he was plea&s;ed with the per&s;on and manners of JULIA, yet &s;he was grieved at the evident marks of illne&s;s, that &s;ickne&s;s had impre&s;&s;ed up|on her face. Indeed the tumults of her mind, the fatigues of her per&s;on, and want of re&s;t, af|fected her &s;o much, that &s;he found her&s;elf &s;inking
<PB N="229" REF="039134_0225_1013B1C28C581478">
beneath them; after a &s;light repa&s;t, her kind ho&s;te&s;s conducted her to her chamber, where &s;he helped undre&s;s, and put her to bed.</P>
<P>With a deep and heavy &s;igh, JULIA laid her aching head upon the pillow, and endeavored to compo&s;e her&s;elf. But how different was her &s;itu|ation, to what it was a few days before, accom|panied by her lover on her way to her benefact|re&s;s, a thou&s;and gay vi&s;ions fluttered before her eyes, and dazzled her in pro&s;pect. She was now deprived of that lover who would in all proba|bility &s;uffer an ignominious death; di&s;carded by that benefactre&s;s; in the care of &s;trangers; at a di&s;tance from any place &s;he had ever &s;een. The&s;e reflections did not &s;erve to clo&s;e her eyes, nor &s;ooth the tumultuous agitations of her heart; but &s;he lay apparently re&s;igned, and patient, until near day, when a tran&s;ient &s;lumber &s;hut out the pa&s;t, and to come, from her view, and &s;he did not awake until morning, dre&s;&s;ed in all its &s;plendor, appeared to drive the drow&s;y god, from &s;cenes &s;o light and charming.</P>
<P>"How are you my dear, (&s;aid Madam de Shong) who &s;tood by her bed &s;ide? JULIA gave her hand, which was dry and hot, and replied &s;he was better than &s;he had been the night before, and would ri&s;e directly. Do not ri&s;e my love, (&s;aid the kind woman,) you are too ill; &s;he left the room and returned in a moment with a medicine; &s;he then bathed her throbbing temples, and in a &s;hort time &s;he became compo&s;ed, and after a few hours re&s;t, became refre&s;hed and better.</P>
<P>She did not &s;ee Ro&s;well until near night, when he came in, he found her in conver&s;ation with the old lady, who had engaged her friend&s;hip and

e&s;teem, by her mildne&s;s and benevolence; Ro&s;|well a&s;&s;ured her that if &s;he had been well e|nough to have given him particular directions, he &s;hould have &s;et off that morning, in pur&s;uit of Mr. Colwort; "but (&s;aid he) I will go tomorrow, and only leave this injunction upon you, that you will be as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible until my return; hope for every thing that you wi&s;h; but remember if tho&s;e wi&s;hes are not gratified, that he who de|nies them has not only infinite power, and infinite wi&s;dom, but infinite mercy." JULIA promi&s;ed obedience to his directions, and after again ex|pre&s;&s;ing her &s;en&s;e of the obligation, &s;he was un|der to him, retired to her apartment to write to COLWORT, and when &s;he had fini&s;hed her letter to him, wrote a few lines to the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA, in which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude for pa&s;t favours; her &s;orrow for having offend|ed her; and her prayers and wi&s;hes for her hap|pine&s;s; &s;he &s;et the affair between the COUNT and COLWORT, in a true light, and implored her mercy and interference in behalf of that un|fortunate young man. In this letter &s;he did not mention the place of her abode, nor drop one hint which would lead to a di&s;covery of her real &s;ituation. The exertion that was nece&s;&s;ary to the writing the&s;e letters, exhau&s;ted her &s;o much, that as &s;oon as they were fini&s;hed, &s;he went to bed, as &s;he could there indulge her feelings, with more freedom, than in any other place. She a|ro&s;e early, and &s;ound Ro&s;well ready to &s;et out upon his benevolent journey; the fire of genius that was expre&s;&s;ed upon his countenance, was &s;o &s;oftened by the expre&s;&s;ion of humanity, &s;o mild|ly mixed with benevolence, that JULIA could
<PB N="231" REF="039134_0227_1013B1C7ECD5FF30">
not help thinking him one of the mo&s;t intere&s;t|ing men &s;he had ever &s;een. He attended to all her directions; received her letters, and promi&s;|ed to do all within the power of a mortal, to re|&s;tore her lover, and happine&s;s; he bade them a|dieu, and was followed by their prayers and good wi&s;hes.</P>

<P>WHEN he was gone, &s;he determined not to &s;ink into unavailing melancholy, and to avoid it, &s;ought for employment; Madam De Shong complied with her reque&s;t, and as &s;he employed all her moments to &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e, pre&s;ented her with &s;ome linen that &s;he had taken to make; JULIA plea&s;ed that &s;he could be of &s;ervice, work|ed with nicene&s;s and alacrity, and gave her wor|thy landlady plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The third day after her arrival, they were at work in a little parlour; JULIA could not help making an ob&s;ervation, that had often occured to her that the manners of her entertainer were &s;o poli&s;hed, that &s;he mu&s;t have moved in a &s;itua|tion

different from her pre&s;ent &s;phere. Your re|mark is ju&s;t, my dear, &s;he replied, and as my mi&s;|fortunes I think will convince you, that you are not the mo&s;t unhappy per&s;on in the world, I will, if my loquacious egoti&s;m will not tire you, I will tell you my &s;tory. JULIA a&s;&s;ured her, that no|thing could oblige her more, and &s;he began as follows:</P>
<Q>  <P>"My father was a wealthy and re&s;pectable Baro|net of the County of Kent, in the kingdom of Great-Britain; of five children, I alone &s;urvived my infancy; and of con&s;equence became the darling of my parents; the whole attention of my excellent mother was be&s;towed upon my ed|ucation, and my father was never &s;o happy as when procuring &s;omething to ornament or plea&s;e his daughter; in my education my mother de|termined that the u&s;eful, &s;hould be mingled with the ornamental; and I was taught every kind of family employment; I have often thought that a kind of pre-&s;entiment of the misfortunes, that were to attend my life, induced this; as I then thought unnece&s;&s;ary care. I &s;ometimes &s;poke of this, to my mother, who always replied, that a woman ought to be acquainted with every kind of family bu&s;ine&s;s, before &s;he commenced hou&s;e|keeper; that a knowledge in dome&s;tic affairs was oftentimes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and could not be an incumbrance in any &s;ituation, as it would not interfere with any polite or elegant ac|compli&s;hment. I loved and re&s;pected my pa|rents too much to di&s;pute their commands, and endeavored to make my&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of all tho&s;e acquirements, that could endear me to them; as I was the undi&s;puted heire&s;s of a large fortune,
<PB N="233" REF="039134_0229_1013B1CE88C63358">
  it cannot be doubted, but I had a number of nominal lovers; and my heart &s;oon gave the preference to a young gentleman, who was noble and wealthy, and had be&s;ides &s;uch accompli&s;h|ments as left the&s;e futile merits far behind them; my parents approved my choice; the day was affixed for my nuptials, but alas! it was over|clouded with woe, for my lover was &s;eized with a violent fever, that terminated his exi&s;tence on the evening of that very day, to which I had for &s;everal months looked forward as the completion of my felicity; I do not pretend to de&s;cribe my feelings, at this beginning of my &s;orrow; I thought then as you do now, that no mi&s;ery could e|qual mine; I knew not that &s;ad experience, would convince me, that the afflictions that were to follow me through life, were began, but light|ly by this. For many months I became a prey, to the mo&s;t corroding grief, I thought it virtu|ous, to be wretched; I indulged my afflictions; I even nur&s;ed them; but one &s;orrow was driven off by another; by an heavier evil; my belov|ed mother fell into a decline, and died in my arms; I &s;aw my father &s;inking beneath a weight of woe; I felt this &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement; but I be|came a proof of the power of a&s;&s;umed fortitude; to relieve him, I concealed my own grief; and &s;oon became what I had only pretended, cheerful; my excellent mother had had a &s;i&s;ter married in France; &s;he had long been dead; her hu&s;band too had paid the debt of nature, &s;ome years be|fore the period I am &s;peaking of; they had left one child, a &s;on, he now came over to England, to vi&s;it us. In the &s;ociety of this poli&s;hed, &s;en&s;i|ble, amiable young man, I forgot my &s;orrows,
<PB N="234" REF="039134_0230_1013B1D00B565418">
 and lo&s;t a fooli&s;h prejudice, the error of young minds, that leads us to imagine the virtuous heart can never feel but one attachment. I had not allowed my&s;elf to reflect that &s;imilar virtues, and &s;imilar abilities, would create &s;imilar attachments; it was the fate of this young man to unde|ceive me, and to learn my heart a tender affec|tion a &s;econd time; indeed, &s;o agreeable were its emotions, that I willingly indulged them, and received with avidity, impre&s;&s;ions &s;o plea&s;ing; my father beheld this change with plea&s;ure, he approved my choice, and in a few months, I be|came the happy wife of the Chevalier De&s;hong, in le&s;s than a year, I was ble&s;&s;ed with a fine &s;on, a circum&s;tance that gave us peculiar plea&s;ure, and was highly gratifying to my poor father. A large e&s;tate in Kent, was &s;ettled by entail upon the elde&s;t grand&s;on that my father &s;hould have, but in ca&s;e of the death of that child, without heirs, it was to go to a very di&s;tant branch of the family; this was a valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and my father did not look with philo&s;ophy upon the probability of its going out of his family, and was quite tran&s;ported with a child, who&s;e healthy, promi&s;ing appearance flattered him with the idea of long life.</P>
 <P>"We were all happy for &s;everal years, and my felicity at that time was more, than I had any rea&s;on to expect, and more than could continue; in the cour&s;e of this time, I had two &s;ons, and two lovely daughters; our board was covered with plenty; we were &s;urrounded with elegance; and health &s;pread its blooming tints upon every face; the fir&s;t interruption to this &s;even years bli&s;s, was the death of my excellent, and lamented
<PB N="235" REF="039134_0231_1013B1D2C7ABEDA0">
 parent; he had been in a langui&s;hment, for &s;ome months, and met death with calmne&s;s and forti|tude.</P>
 <P>"For &s;everal weeks after this event, I felt lo&s;t to the world, and my family, but a dreadful acci|dent recalled me to renewed mi&s;ery; my elde&s;t &s;on, a lovely boy of eight years old was drowned in bathing; you are not a mother, and can but faintly conceive my agony; I &s;hall pa&s;s over my feelings, nor attempt to de&s;cribe them.</P>
 <P>"My hu&s;band propo&s;ed that we &s;hould go to France; I had buried all that rendered England dear to me, and con&s;ented. But previous to this &s;tep the young gentleman to whom our Kenti&s;h e&s;tate devolved, upon the death of my dear boy, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, though he and his guardian had reque&s;ted us to occupy it until he was of age; but every apartment re|called &s;ome &s;cene of plea&s;ure, and every tree was the &s;hadow of departed ble&s;&s;ings; and I wi&s;hed not to &s;tay, where I thought I could never regain my peace, or tranquillity. My hu&s;band turned the remainder of our property into money, and placed it to the amount of forty thou&s;and pounds in a principal banking hou&s;e in London.</P>
 <P>"We arrived in France, in &s;afety, the care of my family by degrees diverted my attention, and before a year had elap&s;ed, I became, not on|ly calm, but cheerful; I now began to ob&s;erve &s;omething uncommon in my daughter, an infant that was born three months after I lo&s;t my &s;on; but I hoped as &s;he grew older, it would wear off, and that &s;he might become like other children, but alas! I was mi&s;taken.</P>
 <P>"We had not lived in France more than five
<PB N="236" REF="039134_0232_1013B1D4655E6FD0">
 years, and indulged in all the plea&s;ures of benev|olence, and affluent beyond our wi&s;hes, when we heard that the hou&s;e, in which our property was ve&s;ted, had failed; my hu&s;band was alarmed at this intelligence; went over to England; he found the report true, and as much fraud was &s;u&s;pected, commenced a law &s;uit that became tire&s;ome and expen&s;ive; for thirteen months, he continued in my native country; and &s;pent a large &s;um of money, after what was already gone; he returned di&s;appointed, and di&s;couraged; but we were &s;o imprudent as to continue our equi|page and &s;plendid way of living; until our hou&s;e and property was attached; this was the final &s;troke to my unfortunate hu&s;band, and he could not &s;urvive it; in three months he fell a victim to di&s;ea&s;e, brought on by &s;orrow, and died of a broken heart. There are &s;ome events that occa|&s;ion &s;uch agonizing &s;en&s;ations, that it is danger|ous to look back upon them; this is of that number, and I mu&s;t pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence.</P>
 <P>"My children &s;till tied me to the world, and life was &s;till dear to me; two hundred louis dours, the produce of my jewels, and &s;ome furni|ture, was all I pre&s;erved, from the wreck of our once noble fortune; &s;ome friends of my hu&s;band's, now exerted them&s;elves in my behalf; they pro|cured my &s;ons admittance to the military &s;chool, where all their nece&s;&s;ary expences were defrayed, and were be&s;ides extremely kind to me; but I could not brook dependence; I was &s;till too proud; my &s;pirit was not &s;ubdued, and I &s;et up a boarding hou&s;e, for Engli&s;hmen; in this I was &s;ucce&s;sful, and now found the benefit of my mother's in&s;truction; I educated my daughters
<PB N="237" REF="039134_0233_1013B1D85EC169C0">
 my&s;elf; with a hou&s;e maid, and one man &s;ervant, I performed the bu&s;ine&s;s of my family. My table was &s;o well &s;upplied, my cookery &s;o good, and &s;o neat, that my hou&s;e was filled with re|&s;pectable boarders; but though when in com|pany with my family, I appeared cheerful, when I retired to my unfortunate Loui&s;a, my heart was bur&s;ting; of all the woes to which human nature is &s;ubjected, there is none can equal the di&s;tre&s;s of a fond mother, when &s;he finds that Providence has given her an idiotical child; this was my &s;ad &s;ate, my daughter was very pretty, but not one ray of rea&s;on, animated her fine features, or &s;parkled in her beautiful eyes; no &s;entiment, but rage was ever expre&s;&s;ed upon her countenance; her pa&s;&s;ions were violent in the extreme, and &s;he required all the attention of one per&s;on, to keep her comfortable; her &s;i&s;ters by turns attended her, and if any thing could have made amends for the wretchedne&s;s &s;he occa&s;ioned, it would have been their good &s;en&s;e, good humour, and amiablene&s;s; but there is no evil, to which we do not by long habit, and acquaintance become &s;o familiarized, as to loo&s;e part of its deformity; in time I was really comfortable, and began again to enjoy life. My &s;ons completed their educa|tion; commi&s;&s;ions were given them of a rank &s;uperior to what they had a right to expect; and they left France, to join the regiment abroad; fol|lowed by the good wi&s;hes of all that knew them; and for young men covered with glory; my heart &s;unk when they left me; I was not enough of the Roman, to &s;ee them go unmoved, and all the mother was in my bo&s;om.</P>
 <P>"Directly after their departure, the young gen|tleman
<PB N="238" REF="039134_0234_1013B1DC5548D270">
 who inherited the e&s;tate of my &s;on's, come over to Paris, to vi&s;it me; I was charmed with his per&s;on, as I had before been by his character; and when he a&s;ked the hand of my elde&s;t daughter Maria, I gave my con&s;ent with plea&s;ure; my dear girl did not he&s;itate to ac|knowledge a reciprocal attachment, and they were married within &s;ix months, of his arrival in France.</P>
 <P>"They tarried with me &s;ix months longer, and their virtues not only endeared them, but the the world to me; at length it became nece&s;&s;ary for my &s;on in law, to return to England, and ev|ery per&s;ua&s;ion was made u&s;e of, to prevail upon me to accompany him, but I could not leave France, yet I con&s;ented that Sophia &s;hould ac|company them; and I promi&s;ed to join them the en&s;uing Autumn; I parted from the&s;e belov|ed children with tears, but the pro&s;pect of hap|pine&s;s that awaited them, &s;weetened the parting pangs, and &s;ix weeks after I received a letter in|forming me of the &s;ad fate of both ve&s;&s;el and crew, the packet was over&s;et by a gale of wind, and every &s;oul except the captain peri&s;hed! I now thought my woes could not increa&s;e, but I was mi&s;taken; the very next po&s;t brought in|telligence that my elde&s;t &s;on had fallen in battle; when I look back upon the&s;e events, that have been pa&s;&s;ed more than twenty years, I wonder that I retained my rea&s;on. But he who wounds the heart, can heal it, and he who afflicts can relieve.</P>
 <P>"My heart was indeed almo&s;t broken, "woes came in clu&s;ters around me," and when I beheld my poor unfortunate daughter, I exclaimed how
<PB N="239" REF="039134_0235_1013B1DDD6727D90">
 in&s;crutable are the ways of Providence, thus to remove the u&s;eful, the lovely, and the amiable ornaments of &s;ociety; and leave her who is a wretched burden. But I bowed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and was re&s;igned; this wretched girl lived ten years after her &s;i&s;ter, and then died of a malignant fe|ver that raged in Paris.</P>
 <P>"After her death I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my lodgers, and with a &s;um of money, &s;ufficient for my own  &s;up|port, retired to this village, where I lived con|tented with my little; a boarder in a cheap, but good family; until it plea&s;ed GOD to take my only earthly comfort; my &s;on died abroad, and with his la&s;t breath bequeathed me this little girl; he had married in Flanders, and lo&s;t his wife, at the birth of her child; I received her with about fifty pi&s;tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s. A &s;hort time after the poor little thing became wholly an orphan; my health was poor, I could do but little, &s;he added to my expences, though her &s;ociety gave me plea&s;ure; and my &s;mall fund was exhau&s;ted, when accident brought me acquainted with Mr. Ro&s;well; he found out my circum&s;tances (and as my pride was now gone; as I no longer con|&s;idered dependance, when it is not the fruits of vice, folly, or indolence, a di&s;grace,) he removed all my difficulties; he purcha&s;ed this little man|&s;ion, furni&s;hed it, hired me a &s;ervant, and &s;ettled an annuity upon me, &s;ufficient to render me comfortable; I &s;hall not need it long, and he will find a rich reward for all his goodne&s;s; for he is benevolence it&s;elf. If I can &s;often your troubles, I &s;hall be doubly happy; as I am &s;ure nothing can be more grateful to him. I look back with agony, it is true, but without regret;
<PB N="240" REF="039134_0236_1013B1E08A78AA00">
 and my greate&s;t mi&s;fortune, gives me &s;ome com|fort; for if I have lo&s;t the deare&s;t, be&s;t of chil|dren, I &s;hall leave none to tread the wayward paths that I have; none to encounter the bitter mi&s;|fortunes, that have been my attendants, through life; or to drink the dregs of &s;orrow, that has been &s;o copiou&s;ly poured out to me.

<P>Here &s;he ended; and JULIA with a look of mingled admiration and &s;ympathy, thanked her for a narrative &s;o full of in&s;truction, and promi&s;|ed to profit by her example, and to acquie&s;ce with a cheerful re&s;ignation with the will of Prov|idence.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A FEW days after Madam De Shong had made the above communications of her life and &s;orrows, to JULIA, the latter took from her pock|et book, the paper that Olivia had given her, the night &s;he left the Chatteau; &s;he recollected that &s;he had de&s;ired her to read it, and then de|liver it as directed; it was directed to the Che|valier St. Armand, of the order of the Knights
<PB N="241" REF="039134_0237_1013B1E22750DD78">
of Malta; &s;he he&s;itated a moment, to whom &s;hould &s;he &s;end it, or who would convey it to the Chevalier; and recollection told her that Mr. Ro&s;well would take that care upon him&s;elf, and &s;he read as follows:</P>
<Q><P>"The injured St. Armand will undoubtedly be &s;urprized, that the wretched Donna Olivia, &s;hould addre&s;s her&s;elf to him, in preference to a|nother; the man whom &s;he has treated the wor&s;t, is &s;urely not the per&s;on, to be applied to in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s; but to whom &s;hould the wretched apply, but to tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;olemn vows, and generous di&s;po&s;itions have bound to protect and a&s;&s;i&s;t.</P>
  <P>"Frown not upon me, nor ca&s;t in &s;corn a pa|per by, becau&s;e it comes from one who has un|done you, and her&s;elf; to you, &s;he will make all the reparation in her power; to her&s;elf alas! &s;he can make none; recollect when I came from Spain, the only daughter of a Grandee of that Kingdom, had you been the only one, who ad|dre&s;&s;ed me, I had been happy, for my heart did ju&s;tice to your merit; though my head was dazzled, by the incen&s;e offered to my vanity; the Duke of Orleans, &s;tood foremo&s;t, and I had the folly to expect to become his wife; it was at this time, that ambition, and vanity tri|umphed over love and rea&s;on; it was at this time I refu&s;ed the only man, who really loved me, and in pur&s;uit of a phantom, lo&s;t every claim to happine&s;s.</P>
  <P>"I will not pretend to de&s;cribe my feelings, when I received your letter, informing me you had taken the vows, and bid me adieu forever; the change was &s;o evident, that it was ob&s;erved;
<PB N="242" REF="039134_0238_1013B1E5E8663960">
  the Duke was di&s;gu&s;ted and left me; but I re|gained my &s;pirits again; plunged into di&s;&s;ipation, and lo&s;t &s;ight of every thing prai&s;e-worthy; years of pro&s;perity flew by like a dream of the morn|ing; or like the &s;hadows with the &s;etting &s;un.</P>
  <P>"At length my father died, and left me pro|vided for, but in a &s;lender manner; I had been u&s;ed to affluence, to grandeur, and to adulation, I could not live without them, and I did not know of how little e&s;timation they are, compared to virtue, and honor.</P>
  <P>"Chance threw in my way the Count de LAU|NA, and from him I received tho&s;e prai&s;es, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to my exi&s;tence. My brother died, and all my property was di&s;&s;olved, my flatterers left me; my friends de&s;erted me; and nothing was left but mi&s;ery and want upon one &s;ide, or di&s;|grace and the Count on the other; I he&s;itated, and his fallacious arguments proved my ruin; his &s;ophi&s;try blinded me to the truth, and I fell an infatuated victim, to vice and his ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
  <P>"No time was left me for reflection, 'till I ar|rived at the Chatteau; until then my &s;en&s;es had been bewildered; I had been blinded by &s;hew and magnificence, and the adulation of the Count's friends intirely fini&s;hed my ruin; but when I commenced my journey; the &s;cales be|gan to fall from my eyes, and a few days after my arrival, the veil was intirely removed, and I beheld the enormities of this wretched, deluded, &s;et of men, in their true colours.</P>
  <P>"You have already heard that the Count DE LAUNA was a principal member of the &s;ect of Illuminati, he had &s;o impo&s;ed upon me, as to per&s;uade me to become one of the order, and
<PB N="243" REF="039134_0239_1013B1E9D3978890">
  a promi&s;e of uncommon honor had &s;o dazzled me, that I was plea&s;ed, and impatient until I was inve&s;ted; the day after I came to the Chat|teau, I was with a mock &s;olemnity, made acquaint|ed with their tenets, tenets &s;o abhorrent to GOD; &s;o di&s;graceful to man, that I &s;huddered at the recital. They do not believe in GOD, or a fu|ture &s;tate; they &s;uppo&s;e all things the work of chance; and all relation&s;hip is di&s;&s;olved; it is law|ful and honorable in their opinion to form con|nections, that we &s;hould think criminal with mothers or &s;i&s;ters. It is ju&s;t and prudent, to take away the life of any that offends them; it is bravery to imbrue their hands in the blood of a brother who is &s;u&s;pected; and death is con|&s;idered as an everla&s;ting &s;leep. The&s;e are but a &s;mall part of their de&s;tructive &s;entiments; it would take whole &s;heets to relate the half of them. I revolted at the idea of an oath &s;o &s;ol|emn as they propo&s;ed, and one week is given me to con&s;ider of it; but a &s;olemn fea&s;t was held to nature, the Godde&s;s they adore, and I was re|que&s;ted to per&s;onate that Deity; I he&s;itated, and a&s;ked what would be required of me? Judge what is my &s;urprize, when informed that di&s;rob|ed of all coverings, except a ve&s;t of &s;ilver gauze, I am to be expo&s;ed to the homage of all the &s;oci|ety pre&s;ent, upon a marble pede&s;tal placed be|hind the altar, upon which &s;acrifices are to be offered. Though dead to virtue, I was not in|tirely lo&s;t to decency, and I refu&s;ed; I blu&s;h to &s;ay that one of my attendants appeared as the Godde&s;s, and that her behaviour charmed them all.</P>

<P>JULIA turned with di&s;gu&s;t from the picture Olivia drew; with pity from the wretched writer; to look with admiration upon Madam DE SHONG; &s;he was mild, meek, and humble, at the &s;ame time, &s;he was active, and always cheerful; with that excellent woman, we will leave her, and go back to the Counte&s;s, of whom we have heard nothing &s;ince &s;he &s;ent for JULIA, into Spain.</P>
<P>That lady expected her beloved ward, until the arrival of the carriage with her &s;ervants; her &s;urprize at the account they gave of her being taken away, could only be equalled by her con|cern, and as &s;he did not &s;u&s;pect her nephew, &s;he applied to him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Marquis in pur&s;uit of her; this artful man pretended equal di&s;tre&s;s with her&s;elf, and appeared ready to take the
<PB N="245" REF="039134_0241_1013B1EFF1ED0D38">
mo&s;t active mea&s;ures, to di&s;cover JULIA; all Paris and its &s;uburbs were &s;earched, every Con|vent in the Kingdom examined; until worn out with un&s;ucce&s;sful enquiries, they gave up in de&s;|pair what appeared &s;o vain and fruitle&s;s; and the Count concluded to vi&s;it his Chatteau, mak|ing u&s;e of the death of Leonora, as an argument for his going down at that time; he had for &s;ome time kept Donna Olivia, and though he &s;upport|ed her in great magnificence, neither his father or aunt knew of his connection; he had held up the tenets of the Illuminati to her view; he had dazzled her under&s;tanding, and impo&s;ed upon her vanity; but though &s;he &s;acrificed to vice, her &s;oul bowed to virtue; and when &s;he looked in upon her&s;elf, &s;he was &s;hocked at the folly of her proceedings; &s;he accompanied him to the Chat|teau, and from her arrival, was viewed with jea|lou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion; they would not confide to her half their &s;ecrets; until &s;he had taken the oaths, and as &s;he he&s;itated, they became &s;till more unea&s;y; what &s;he had known of them, &s;hocked her to the &s;oul, and &s;he could not help viewing them as fiends from the infernal regions; and &s;he did not fail to remon&s;trate to the Count again&s;t the iniquity of his proceedings; but tho' the under&s;tanding of Olivia, was &s;uperior to ma|ny, &s;he had by becoming a &s;lave to a vicious propen&s;ity, overthrown her own arguments, and &s;he &s;aw that he turned from her with di&s;gu&s;t; &s;he found her once ardent lover, cold, and in&s;en|&s;ible; anxious to di&s;cover the rea&s;on; &s;he &s;ought the cau&s;e with avidity, and found that JULIA was confined in the hou&s;e; &s;he was no longer &s;urprized, and her pity for the unfortunate girl,
<PB N="246" REF="039134_0242_1013B1F17420B618">
was heightened by her admiration of tho&s;e vir|tues which Philada extolled &s;o highly. She was &s;en&s;ible of the danger to which &s;he was expo&s;ed, and after laying a plan for her e&s;cape, retired, and wrote the letter that is mentioned in this chapter, and was ha&s;tening to her apartment when &s;he met her de&s;cending with Colwort.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, &s;he went to the Count, whom &s;he found in&s;en&s;ible, his arm bleed|ing, and his temple, which he had &s;truck in his fall, &s;wollen to an amazing degree; it was &s;eve|ral hours before he recovered his recollection, and when he did, after con&s;ulting a &s;urgeon, who &s;up|po&s;ed him in no danger; he enquired for JULIA and her deliverer, when informed of their e&s;cape, his rage knew no bounds, and &s;ummoning &s;ome of his a&s;&s;ociates, they took different routs in pur|&s;uit of the fugitives. COLWORT they overtook, and conveyed to a private pri&s;on. JULIA e&s;caped them, though &s;ome of them delivered an order in the name of the Counte&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould not be admitted at the Villa; while a party laid wait for the unprotected girl; this part of their &s;cheme was rendered abortive, by the humane care of Mr. Ro&s;well, and they retired to the Chatteau with an account of their achievement.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Jaques faithful to his prom|i&s;e, had delivered JULIA'S letter to the Counte&s;s; who read with amazement its contents, and hearing from Jaques every circum&s;tance that had occured at the Chatteau, took him into her &s;er|vice, and then accompanied by the Marquis, and a retinue too numerous to fear the Count, and his myrmidons &s;et out for the retreat of the Count; they travelled with all the expedition that the in|firmities
<PB N="247" REF="039134_0243_1013B1F425448AE8">
of the Marquis would permit; but when within a few leagues of the end of their journey, were met by a me&s;&s;enger, who informed them that the unhappy man, was at the point of death, they pu&s;hed forward, and arrived but a few hours before the clo&s;ing of a life, filled with guilt and iniquity. The change in the Count was ob&s;erv|ed directly after the return of tho&s;e who went in pur&s;uit of JULIA, and COLWORT; and was oc|ca&s;ioned by an accident, that proves the retribu|tion of Providence. The Count had always kept with him the doctor, who, officiated at the illne&s;s of his mother in law; he had admini&s;tered the cordial that quickened her pa&s;&s;age from &s;cenes of mortality and pain, to tho&s;e of joy unfading; finding it nece&s;&s;ary to open a vein; notwith|&s;tanding the lo&s;s of blood had been great, he applied by mi&s;take a lancet diped in a mo&s;t deadly poi&s;on; his whole ma&s;s of blood was in|fected, and &s;ymptoms of approaching death ap|peared; the doctor's agitation betrayed his &s;e|cret, and he applied every art of medicine, in vain; it was then that his a&s;&s;ociates, his fal&s;ely named friends, left him; but his &s;ervants &s;ecur|ed the &s;urgeon, until the Marquis &s;hould arrive. He was then left only to the unfortunate Olivia, and his &s;ervants. The de&s;ertion of the&s;e people &s;eemed to convince him of his errors; he begged Olivia to write the Marquis; to intreat he would ha&s;ten to him, for indeed he had a dreadful ac|count to &s;ettle with him. This unhappy woman obeyed his directions; and was &s;urprized to find they arrived &s;o much &s;ooner than they could ex|pect.</P>
<P>She left the Count in a partial &s;leep, and met
<PB N="248" REF="039134_0244_1013B1F5C3D18618">
them in the parlour, the Counte&s;s was &s;urprized to find her there; and her di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion told them how much &s;he felt her humiliating &s;tate; in a conci&s;e manner, &s;he told them the e|vents that had &s;hortened the life of the Count, and as &s;oon as he awaked, they went to his bed chamber, were they found him in his la&s;t ago|nies; he &s;tretched out his hand to his father; begged his forgivene&s;s for all his vices; owned they had been many, and aggravated; lamented his early departure from virtue; his connection with her oppo&s;ite, and attributed it to the ex|ample and pernicious doctrine of the vile &s;ect with whom he had a&s;&s;ociated; he begged every one would leave the room, but his father, his aunt, and Philada, and when his reque&s;t was com|plied with, he began to remark the retribution of that power, who&s;e exi&s;tence he had denied; who had cho&s;en that very hand, as the in&s;tru|ment of his death, that he had employed to fin|i&s;h the days of the amiable Marchione&s;s, while the Marquis heard this recital, his agony and ag|itation was &s;o great, that his unhappy &s;on became more bewildered; he was forced to take a cor|dial, and when he endeavoured to proceed, he was evidently dying, his voice was thick and difficult to be under&s;tood; but the name of the Marchi|one&s;s, was again pronounced, of a child, and of a &s;ervant; at length he found he could not make him&s;elf intelligent, he &s;topped as if to recollect him&s;elf, and then added, I am too weak to &s;ay what I wi&s;h; &s;end to the hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur Nancrede in Paris; there is confined a woman, who&s;e te&s;timony is true, believe her; confide in her; &s;he will unravel a &s;cene of iniquity; &s;he
<PB N="249" REF="039134_0245_1013B1F9A5812A70">
will direct you to find a lo&s;t&mdash;his words died upon his lips; he fell into convul&s;ions, and died without pronouncing another &s;yllable.</P>
<P>When they &s;aw he was really gone; the un|happy father with the Counte&s;s retired into ano|ther apartment, and left the wretched remains to the care of his dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was interred, which ceremony was performed without pomp or parade; the Marquis prepared to examine the doctor, but he had e&s;|caped amid&s;t the general confu&s;ion; Donna Oli|via now urged them to &s;end to Paris, as &s;he a&s;|&s;ured them that &s;ome important &s;ecret, hung up|on the relea&s;e of a woman whom the Count had &s;ince his confinement, &s;everal times mentioned; and had a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he had been confined &s;everal years; at the &s;ame time &s;he gave &s;uch an account of the deliverer of JULIA, as convinced them it was Colwort; upon inquiry of the keep|er of the pri&s;on, not a doubt remained; and they &s;ought to find out the place of his confinement; determined to relea&s;e and make him happy. As for JULIA they did not he&s;itate to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was at the Villa, and the Counte&s;s &s;ent off a &s;erv|ant, to inform her of all that had happened at the Chatteau; but the man returned in a few days, with an account of her having been denied admit|tance, and that they had heard nothing of her &s;ince; this was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the affectionate heart of the Marquis and his &s;i&s;ter; who feared &s;he was betrayed again into the hands of the Illumi|nati; and both entertained &s;o dreadful an idea of this &s;ect, that they dreaded the thoughts of her &s;ufferings and danger.</P>
<P>Within a few days the per&s;on who had been
<PB N="250" REF="039134_0246_1013B1FD7733E988">
&s;ent to Paris, returned with intelligence from Mon&s;ieur Nancrede, that the woman who had been intru&s;ted to his care, had corrupted the man who attended upon her, and with him made her e&s;cape; thus was a &s;ecret of apparent great import|ance, &s;till enveloped in clouds of my&s;tery; this perplexed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Marquis and his &s;i&s;ter; the former of whom was now bending be|neath the accumulated weight of &s;orrow and in|firmity, and the latter &s;uffering all the pains of &s;in|cere friend&s;hip for a beloved object.</P>
<P>Several weeks pa&s;&s;ed off in this manner, when one afternoon a &s;ervant informed the Counte&s;s, that a young Engli&s;hman wi&s;hed to &s;peak to her. The &s;ervant added a &s;econd time, he is an En|gli&s;hman, Madam, and the Counte&s;s who&s;e imag|ination dwelt upon JULIA and Colwort, imme|diately &s;uppo&s;ed it mu&s;t be him; &s;he ordered him to be admitted, and the moment he enter|ed the door, &s;he &s;aw indeed that it was not her young friend; &s;he was di&s;appointed, for though his air was elegant, his per&s;on genteel, and his countenance expre&s;&s;ive, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, it bore no re&s;emblance of her deliverer; with a &s;igh of chagrin, &s;he a&s;ked his bu&s;ine&s;s; I have pre&s;umed to wait upon you, Madam, in behalf of a very lovely, but a very unfortunate young woman; could I flatter my&s;elf my emba&s;&s;y, would be &s;uc|ce&s;sful, I &s;hould be very happy. If unfortunate in other re&s;pects, (&s;aid the Counte&s;s,) &s;he has been fortunate, in her amba&s;&s;ador, for I am convinced I cannot deny any thing to your intreaties. I have been taught to expect every thing from your philanthropy, Madam, and I am convinced mi&s;|fortune never &s;ued in vain. The writer of this
<PB N="251" REF="039134_0247_1013B1FEF8C0EE40">
letter, (he &s;aid, and he laid it upon the table by her, bowing). The eye of the Counte&s;s was caught by the direction, &s;urely, &s;urely I am not deceived (&s;aid &s;he,) it is the character of my beloved JULIA; it is indeed, (&s;aid Ro&s;well,) for it was him&s;elf, the character of the amiable JULIA VALLACE, and it is upon her account, that I wait upon you. She needs no interce&s;&s;ion, &s;he cried, as &s;he opened the letter, and I thank heaven that I have a pro&s;|pect of &s;eeing my amiable friend again; tell me &s;ir; tell me where &s;he is, and where I &s;hall find her; my arms, my heart, are open to receive her.&mdash;This will be a rich, a reviving cordial to her af|flicted &s;pirit, (cried Ro&s;well) I will ha&s;ten on the wings of impatience, to bear the&s;e tidings of joy. Amiable young man, (&s;aid the Counte&s;s) how I venerate the warmth, the genero&s;ity of your feel|ings; but I will read, what &s;he &s;ays, I am &s;ure you will excu&s;e me. In peru&s;ing this letter of JULIA'S, the tears of the Counte&s;s bore witne&s;s of her affection. When &s;he ended, &s;he made a thou&s;and enquiries of Ro&s;well, and though he &s;pake with mode&s;ty of his own &s;ervices, yet he painted her di&s;tre&s;s in true colours. Madam DE LAUNA expre&s;ed her gratitude, for his goodne&s;s and explained the treachery that had given the appearance of cruelty to any part of her conduct; She then a&s;ked if he had been &s;ucce&s;sful, with re&s;pect to Colwort Ro&s;ewell informed her that he &s;hould have been with her three weeks &s;ince, but for an alarming indi&s;po&s;ition with which he was &s;eized upon his journey; that he had made every po&s;&s;ible &s;earch for his countryman, hither|to without &s;ucce&s;s; but if he was aided by her and the Marquis, he had no doubt but his next
<PB N="252" REF="039134_0248_1013B201A253C010">
attempts would be more effectual. The Coun|te&s;s a&s;&s;ured him of every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance from her&s;elf and brother; and when the Marquis came in, informed him of the plea&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s of Ro&s;well, and pre&s;ented him as the deliverer of JULIA. The venerable man received him with every expre&s;&s;ion of regard, and gratitude; and Ro&s;|well found by his manner as well as looks, how dear JULIA was to him. They concluded to &s;et out the next morning for the habitation of Mad|am De Shong, as they both declared that they would run no farther ri&s;que of di&s;appointment, to them&s;elves; or of her &s;afety, by tru&s;ting her in le&s;s affectionate, or le&s;s intere&s;ted hands, than their own.</P>

<P>WE will now return to JULIA, who&s;e fate &s;eemed to draw towards a cri&s;is, dreadful indeed! For two of the four weeks, that Ro&s;well had been ab&s;ent, &s;he and her venerable friend had looked for him, with increa&s;ing impatience. When they beheld the &s;un ari&s;e in the morning, they hoped, that he with them, would greet its exit;
<PB N="253" REF="039134_0249_1013B2038E3A1700">
but every evening brought a new di&s;appointment. For every morning found them flu&s;hed with hope.</P>
<P>Working and reading divided their time; and conver&s;ation &s;upplied every interval, with &s;ome|thing new and intere&s;ting. After &s;itting up late one night, and talking over again, every topic that they loved to dwell on; they retired to their &s;eperate apartments, and a gentle &s;lumber, had &s;ealed up their &s;en&s;es, when they were awoke by the cry of fire. JULIA, who was fir&s;t alarmed by finding her apartment enveloped in flames, which had caught the curtains, that were around the bed, &s;prang up, and ru&s;hed immediate|ly through the fire, into Madam DE SHONG'S room; &s;he had pre&s;ence of mind, to pull too the door, and though that and every other apart|ment was in a blaze, it had not reached the chamber of her ho&s;te&s;s, who was that moment arou&s;ed by the &s;moke, and the cries of the people without, who were ju&s;t collected.</P>
<P>JULIA &s;aw &s;he was bewildered, and be&s;ought her to get up, and endeavour to &s;ave her&s;elf; the little Maria was running about, in great di&s;|tre&s;s; and a per&s;on entered the window, by a ladder; come Madamoi&s;elle, (he cried,) we will &s;ave you; tru&s;t your&s;elf to me. Not before Madam DE SHONG, has e&s;caped the fire (&s;aid JULIA with firmne&s;s) &s;ave your&s;elf, my dear children, (cried the old lady;) my life is nearly at an end; your's is ju&s;t beginning. The per&s;on declared, this was no time for argument, and as he found JULIA would not go, until her friend was &s;afe, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a young, and ac|tive man, he lifted her from the window, and in a
<PB N="254" REF="039134_0250_1013B2088F415D70">
moment &s;he was upon the ground; JULIA next in&s;i&s;ted that Maria, &s;hould de&s;cend the ladder; and though frighted, the little girl was too active to need much a&s;&s;i&s;tance; a young gentleman who had before per&s;uaded JULIA to go down, caught her in his arms, and forced her from the window, and in le&s;s than a minute the roof &s;unk in. The maid &s;ervant who laid below &s;tairs had awaked the fir&s;t, &s;he had attempted to a&s;cend the &s;tairs, to inform tho&s;e above, but found the &s;tairca&s;e an intire body of fire; &s;he then alarmed the neighbourhood, with her cries, and though every one was &s;afe, not one article of cloathing, or furniture, was pre&s;erved from this mo&s;t devour|ing element.</P>
<P>The young man, who had at the ri&s;que of his own life &s;aved that of JULIA, &s;till &s;tood by her, he had wrapped her in a large cloak of his own; for &s;he was only habited in her night cloaths, and by every &s;oothing attention, endeavored to keep her &s;pirits from fainting; but her concern was wholly occupied by Madam, and &s;he &s;eemed to lo&s;e every per&s;onal concern, in her anxiety for her.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;ided, and they were carried into a neighbouring hou&s;e and put to bed; but the mo&s;t painful ideas, drove off every thought of &s;leep; Madam reflected that perhaps &s;ome accident, had happened to Ro&s;well which might prevent his return, and that in this helple&s;s, unfriended &s;tate, &s;he &s;hould be left to &s;uffer all the evils attendant upon poverty, and old age. JULIA'S reflections were not of a more plea&s;ing nature; &s;he recollected that but for her, Mr. Ro&s;well would have been with them at the
<PB N="255" REF="039134_0251_1013B20B4EBDF0E8">
time of this dreadful accident; and that perhaps the &s;park that caught the hou&s;e, had fell from her candle; her pur&s;e that was by no means ex|hau&s;ted had fallen a prey to the fire, and her cloaths had peri&s;hed with it. This la&s;t want, was &s;upplied the next morning by the charity of &s;ome neighbours, and for &s;everal days their kind|ne&s;s was continued; but it then &s;eemed to cea&s;e, and every hour their impatience to hear from Ro&s;well increa&s;ed; the fifth day after their mi&s;|fortune, the young gentleman who had &s;aved JU|LIA, called upon them, and after lamenting the evil to which he had been a witne&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed his admiration of the young lady, and without any he&s;itation propo&s;ed that they &s;hould all re|&s;ide with him, at his hou&s;e which was large and convenient. While Madam and JULIA expre&s;&s;|ed their gratitude for this offer, which the latter was about to accept, when he turned to JULIA and with an a&s;&s;urance unequalled, offered to &s;ettle an annuity upon her for life, and take the care of her friend, and the little girl upon him&s;elf, if &s;he would con&s;ent to live with him as a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Her a&s;toni&s;hment at this affrontive propo&s;al, aro&s;e to anger that &s;he had never felt before, and in the mo&s;t &s;pirited terms &s;he refu&s;ed him, and told him that &s;he &s;hould in future value her life much le&s;s than &s;he had ever done before, becau&s;e it had been &s;aved by a man, that &s;he &s;o &s;incerely de&s;pi&s;ed; &s;he concluded by de&s;iring him to leave the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and Madam repeated her commands, in a void of decided authority, that was not to be trifled with.</P>
<P>He had but ju&s;t left them, when the per&s;on to whom the hou&s;e belonged, entered, and informed
<PB N="256" REF="039134_0252_1013B20D0FC6AE58">
them that they mu&s;t quit the apartment that very night, as they expected &s;ome friends that rendered it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Madam was really &s;ick, and JULIA knew no|thing of the neighbourhood; they knew not what to do, nor which way to turn when Calli&s;ta, the girl, who had lived with Madam, and who was much attached to her, called to &s;ee them, &s;he re&s;ided with her &s;i&s;ter, who occupied only one room; and &s;upported her&s;elf by labour; this girl told them &s;he believed they could get lodgings, or at lea&s;t a room, for a few days, at a tavern, about a mile from their old re&s;idence.&mdash;It was now afternoon, and JULIA accompanied by Calli&s;ta, walked immediately there; &s;he tried &s;everal hou&s;es on the way, but met with no &s;ucce&s;s, and when &s;he arrived, found her&s;elf &s;o fa|tigued, as convinced her the di&s;tance mu&s;t be treble what &s;he had been informed. She told the tavern-keeper, that they expected a friend who would pay all their expences, and that if any thing &s;hould prevent his coming, Madam would &s;end to her banker, at Paris, for her annuity, which would become due in a month. The man made many objections, but at la&s;t her per|&s;ua&s;ions, aided by the intreaties of Calli&s;ta, pre|vailed; and he &s;et out in a chai&s;e, for Madam, who immediately le&s;t the hou&s;e &s;he was at, and arrived ju&s;t as it grew dark; JULIA who had not returned, had bu&s;ied her&s;elf in preparing the apartment, which was up two pair of &s;tairs, was &s;urprized to find Maria was not with her, and heard with much &s;ati&s;faction, that a per&s;on who lived near, had invited the little girl to &s;pend a week with their children, who were a|bout
<PB N="257" REF="039134_0253_1013B20FC2CF44D0">
her age; this le&s;&s;ened their expences, and JULIA a&s;&s;ured Madam of her alacrity, in &s;upply|ing the want of an attendant.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days, they were &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions from the landlord's table; but after that the re&s;ource failed, and JULIA who began to be apprehen&s;ive of extreme want, propo&s;ed to Mad|am, that &s;he would walk to a Convent, and endea|vour to procure &s;ome employ, for &s;he had tried in vain, in the neighbourhood, and every per&s;on was obliged to do their own work. The walk was long and tire&s;ome, and when JULIA inform|ed the Abbe&s;s of her &s;ituation, that lady, though liberal of her advice, refu&s;ed her any employ|ment, and &s;uffered her to depart, without that refre&s;hment, of which &s;he certainly &s;tood in need.</P>
<P>She had &s;carcely &s;et forward on her return, when &s;he was overtaken by the very man, who&s;e in&s;olence had &s;o added to her affliction, and &s;o much offended her; &s;he &s;tarted when he joined her, and was irre&s;olute whether to return, or go on, but reflection told her that it was not proba|ble he would in&s;ult her on her way; &s;he kept forward, and gave no an&s;wer to his inquiries, until the began to a&s;k her pardon, for the in&s;ult he had dared to offer her, in his late vi&s;it. JU|LIA then told him, if he really wi&s;hed her to think of him with le&s;s anger than &s;he then did, he mu&s;t leave her, as &s;he could not enter into a|ny conver&s;ation with a man who had treated her &s;o ill; but he replied he was then on his way to find her, to offer her all the reparation in his pow|er; I have been wretched, &s;ince I left you (&s;aid he,) that I dared to in&s;ult &s;o much virtue and delicacy; and as I can never love or honor any

woman as I do you, I have now come to beg you will accept my hand, and become the partak|er of that ample fortune, which Providence has be&s;towed upon me; he he&s;itated and JULIA lo&s;t her anger, but with firmne&s;s &s;he informed him, that her vows of tenderne&s;s and fidelity, had long been given to another; and if they were &s;till divided by that fate that had been &s;o cruel to them, &s;he &s;hould never tran&s;fer her af|fections to another; but &s;he &s;hould always con|&s;ider his propo&s;als as an honor that &s;he &s;hould reflect upon with plea&s;ure; as it convinced her, her conduct had not been reprehen&s;ible. He then lamented his attachment, but begged, tho' &s;he could not love him, &s;he would give him a claim upon her e&s;teem, and oblige him by accept|ing that a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which he was &s;ure &s;he &s;tood in need; he be&s;ought her with &s;o much earne&s;t|ne&s;s to accept at lea&s;t a temporary &s;upply, that for a moment her wants and tho&s;e of her venera|ble friend, made her he&s;itate; but prudence got the better, and with a grateful but mode&s;t firm|ne&s;s, &s;he refu&s;ed every a&s;&s;i&s;tance, however trifling. He appeared di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at her refu&s;al, and left her, chagrined and unhappy; a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done her duty, now became her only &s;upport; before &s;he arrived at her temporary abode, the weather became tempe&s;tuous, and night came on with additional horror and darkne&s;s. She went immediately to her friend whom &s;he found faint for want of nouri&s;hment, as &s;he had not taken a|ny for the day; this was likewi&s;e the ca&s;e with JULIA; and her walk had &s;o exhau&s;ted her, that it was with difficulty &s;he could go through the unplea&s;ing ta&s;k of relating her ill &s;ucce&s;s; but tho'
<PB N="259" REF="039134_0255_1013B2152262CF88">
&s;ick and faint to the heart, Madam held her hand with tenderne&s;s to her lips, embraced her with affection, and a&s;&s;ured her that her con|duct had been exactly con&s;i&s;tent with female de|corum.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, they conver&s;ed upon their un|happy &s;ituation, and endeavoured to in&s;pire each other, with that fortitude which was &s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry; when a girl who attended at the Hotel came up for &s;ome chairs, for Madamoi&s;elle (&s;aid &s;he) we have a power of company below; we may thank the &s;torm for that however. JULIA then recollected a miniature picture, that her mother had hung around her neck when quite a child, it was richly &s;et in gold, and &s;urrounded by two rows of diamonds; &s;he looked at it for a moment, her own wants however pre&s;&s;ing, would never have tempted her to part with it, but when &s;he reflected that Madam DE SHONG was really &s;uf|fering for hunger, &s;he took it from her neck, and pre&s;&s;ing it to her lips, with a deep drawn &s;igh, &s;he followed the girl out of the chamber, and putting it in her hand, reque&s;ted her to en|deavor to di&s;po&s;e of it to &s;ome of the gue&s;ts below. The girl who really pitied them, and who&s;e heart was truly &s;ympathetic, looked at JULIA'S pale face with tears, and delivering her a candle which &s;he was carrying away, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would &s;ell it to the be&s;t advantage, and return to her immediately.</P>
<P>JULIA returned to the chamber, with the light, and upon the inquiries of her friend was obliged to confe&s;s what &s;he had done; tho' Ma|dam felt the full force of the &s;acrifice JULIA had made, yet &s;he could not wi&s;h her to recall it,
<PB N="260" REF="039134_0256_1013B217CECE2940">
and li&s;tened with a palpitating heart for the re|turn of their me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>The girl went directly to the room that was appropriated to the gue&s;ts, and having &s;et down the chairs, advanced to a lady, who &s;at with a gentleman by the fire, and who was examining with critical &s;crutiny the face of an old gentleman and a lady, who had ju&s;t entered; a young man was bu&s;ied with &s;everal attendants, in getting refre&s;hments, and wiping the wet from the la|dy's habit. But when the girl pre&s;ented the picture and begged to know if none of their hon|ors would plea&s;e to buy it; &s;he held out her hand, and having examined it for a moment, and turning a &s;pring di&s;covered two miniatures in&s;tead of one, and with a kind of frantic a&s;ton|i&s;hment demanded to &s;ee the per&s;on, who &s;ent it, as &s;he was &s;ure it was &s;tolen; the girl declared the innocence of the young lady, who had, de|&s;ired her to &s;ell it, and after &s;ome time offered to conduct her to the chamber; and the gentlemen declared they would accompany them, with a view to &s;uccor that di&s;tre&s;s, that the girl had in &s;imple, but pathetic language, delineated.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the confu|&s;ion of the whole party, upon entering the cham|ber, the affrighted girl who&s;e &s;prightly activity left the others far behind her, entered ju&s;t time to &s;ay, that a lady with a great many others were coming up to &s;ecure JULIA as a thief, and was &s;ure, the picture was &s;tolen.</P>
<P>JULIA was &s;upported by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her innocence; but Madam already weak, almo&s;t fainted with apprehen&s;ions; and JULIA on her knees at the bed &s;ide begged her to be compo&s;ed, and held a &s;melling bottle to her no&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="039134_0257_1013B21A917F1488">
In this affecting &s;ituation, pale as death, and her heart throbbing with a variety of &s;en&s;ations; in a mean chamber almo&s;t without furniture, her eyes fixed upon her almo&s;t dying friend, JULIA heeded not the entrance of the &s;trangers, but in a moment the &s;ilver toned voice of Ro&s;|well, caught her ear. Good Heavens, (he cried) what do I &s;ee, Madam DE SHONG, JULIA VAL|LACE? What has brought you here, why have you left &hellip;. but before he proceeded, the Counte&s;s held JULIA fa&s;t locked in her arms, and called her by all the tendere&s;t names, that love and friend&s;hip could dictate. Half frantic with joy, her emotions became too powerful, and pre&s;&s;ing the Counte&s;s to her bo&s;om, &s;he faint|ed. Madam was nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and the humane maid declared they were both dying for want of food, as they had eat nothing for near two days. Ro&s;well, almo&s;t di&s;tracted, flew down &s;tairs and returned in a moment, with &s;ome cake and cordial from the coach; JULIA was now recovering, and the per&s;ua&s;ions of the Counte&s;s prevailed on her to take a bit of the cake, and drink &s;ome of the liquor. Madam was &s;upplied by Ro&s;well, who with all the tenderne&s;s of a &s;on, whole bo&s;om glowed with a fond and re&s;pectful affection towards an indulgent mother, per&s;uaded her to take the refre&s;hment he had brought.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than half an hour, they became com|po&s;ed enough to communicate the cau&s;e of their removal, and the Counte&s;s declared it the work of Heaven, for if the &s;torm had not obliged them to &s;eek a &s;helter at the Inn, they &s;hould not have &s;topped until they arrived at the lately de&s;troyed
<PB N="262" REF="039134_0258_1013B21EAD6CFF70">
dwelling, and they &s;hould not have found them until morning, when help in all probability would have come too late.</P>
<P>JULIA now began to recollect the cau&s;e of their being together, and de&s;ired to &s;ee her ac|cu&s;er, and that her miniature might be returned, the lady who had &s;tood quite back, but who had ob&s;erved all that had happened, now came for|ward. Tell me, (&s;aid &s;he,) if JULIA does not remember the woman who protected her as a mother; who &s;aved her infant life, and who de|voted her&s;elf to her and &hellip;.. but before &s;he could fini&s;h the &s;entence, JULIA exclaimed, it is my mother! good Heavens it is my mother! and &s;he &s;unk upon her knees before her; re|member you, Oh yes! and rejoice to &s;ee you; rejoice that you are re&s;tored to me. The lady embraced her with tears and affection. I am my dear and honored young lady, (&s;aid &s;he) not your mother; &s;he has long &s;ince fallen a victim to cruelty and vice; but I can re&s;tore you to a parent that de&s;erves &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing; here, &s;ir, (&s;aid &s;he) turning to the Marquis, I re&s;tore to you a daughter, the daughter of your much lov|ed Marchione&s;s, who with her dying breath, bade me pre&s;erve her for you. Surely, (&s;aid the Marquis) you deceive me; I can never be &s;o ble&s;t, I never had a daughter. I do not deceive you, (&s;aid the woman,) as &s;ure as you &s;tand there, this young lady is your daughter. Look at me, &s;ir, view me well, has twenty years &s;o altered me, that you have forgotten that I&s;abella, who fol|lowed your beloved Marchione&s;s from Italy.&mdash;What, (cried the Marquis,) are you indeed that faithful I&s;abella, whom my wife e&s;teemed &s;o
<PB N="263" REF="039134_0259_1013B2202F539DA8">
much; Oh! I no longer doubt, and with grati|tude and joy, I embrace the ble&s;&s;ing that you pre&s;erved for me; but how pre&s;erved, I cannot yet divine; my lovely daughter, come to the arms of a fond, and affectionate parent; who&s;e greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings are comprized in you. JU|LIA embraced her father with a tran&s;port that was new to her heart, but &s;o plea&s;ing, &s;o exqui&s;ite, that &s;he would not have exchanged it, for all the joys of the &s;en&s;uali&s;t, and all the riches of the Ea&s;t. It was not that &s;he knew her&s;elf the daughter of a Nobleman of the fir&s;t wealth and re&s;pectabili|ty in the Kingdom; but that &s;he had found a parent, who&s;e virtue had rendered him beloved and e&s;teemed by all. That &s;he could attend to him all hours; watch his declining years, and &s;ooth the infirmities of old age; it was this, that gave &s;o &s;incere a joy to her heart; that her tran&s;|port defied the power of expre&s;&s;ion; that &s;he could claim as a right the protection of tho&s;e friends who loved her as &s;uch, before they knew of her relation&s;hip; her bo&s;om had been &s;o un|u&s;ed to &s;en&s;ations delightful as the&s;e, that now ru&s;hed in a full tide of pro&s;perity upon her, that it needed the abatement of not &s;eeing COLWORT among&s;t the friends that now &s;urrounded her; to prevent its effects being too &s;trong, too mighty, to be &s;upported; but wonder and a&s;ton|i&s;hment &s;u&s;pended for a while, the tran&s;ports of all.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was the fir&s;t to a&s;k an ex|planation; &s;he did not doubt the truth, the plea&s;ing truth, but &s;he wi&s;hed to know by what wonderful means this daughter, had been pre&s;erv|ed; &s;he recollected the countenance of I&s;abella,
<PB N="264" REF="039134_0260_1013B222DC9FAAD0">
and after embracing JLUIA, as a lovely and be|loved neice, &s;he begged that her curio&s;ity might be &s;atisfied. I will with plea&s;ure obey you, Mad|am, after the tumults of this dear child's heart have &s;ub&s;ided; I think the attendant declares that neither &s;he nor this venerable woman, have taken any nouri&s;hment for twenty-four hours; until the &s;light one that has been pre&s;ented; and though her agitated &s;pirits are now in&s;en&s;ible to every thing but joy, at finding friends &s;o beloved; yet nature mu&s;t be exhau&s;ted. After &s;upper, which is now preparing, I will unfold all my &s;tory, by that time, we &s;hall all be more compo&s;ed; more fitted to receive &s;ome alloy, than we are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Every one approved of her motion, and they went immediately below; Madam DE SHONG felt the renovation of her youth, and de&s;ired to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted down, if what was to be told was not a &s;ecret. The Marquis declared that he &s;o re|&s;pected, and revered her character, that he had not a wi&s;h to conceal any thing from her; and Ro&s;well, with all the nervous &s;trength of youth, and the tenderne&s;s of an amiable heart, without difficulty, a&s;&s;i&s;ted her below &s;tairs.</P>
<P>When &s;eated at the &s;upper table, JULIA look|ed around her, with tearful eyes, and an happy heart, her &s;en&s;ations were &s;o exqui&s;ite; pre&s;&s;ed by her father to partake of this or that little del|icacy; that &s;he a&s;ked if it was indeed real, that &s;he was &s;o ble&s;t! &s;o happy!</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the cloth was removed, the hu&s;band of I&s;abella reminded her of her promi&s;e, and &s;he began as follows:</P>
<Q>  <P>"You will, &s;ir, recollect with what reluctance, my lady parted from you, when you were order|ed to the Court of Spain; you had been gone but a few days when the Baron dared to in&s;ult her with a declaration of love; my lady's heart was almo&s;t broken by his impiety; &s;he immediately wrote to you, but the letter never reached you, and &s;he behaved with &s;o much &s;pirit, that the Baron de&s;pairing of obtaining his wi&s;hes, was affronted, his love was turned into hate, and he vowed revenge; my poor lady, was &s;urround|ed by his dome&s;tics, and I &s;aw was apprehen|&s;ive of her life; &s;he could confide in none, but Philada and me, and never &s;uffered us both to be out of her pre&s;ence, at a time; one day being much indi&s;po&s;ed,&mdash;I&s;abella (&s;aid &s;he,) if I &s;hould die, without &s;eeing the Marquis, as I think I &s;hall, and leave a child behind me, &s;wear to me that you will protect that child; that you will pre&s;erve her from the malice of the Baron; that you will never deliver her into any hands but the Marquis, or the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA; but run no ri&s;que of her falling into the power of the Baron; it will &s;tand between him, and va&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="266" REF="039134_0262_1013B229520BC810">
  and he will &s;top at nothing, to put the little orphan out of the way; I took the oath &s;he required, and &s;he put into my care two ca&s;kets of rich jewels, with the miniature of your lord|&s;hip and her&s;elf, which you had cau&s;ed to be fix|ed together by a &s;pring, when you courted her. My poor lady was a true prophete&s;s for that very night, &s;he was delivered of a daughter, and died in a few hours after. Philada who loved her with a faithful affection, was &s;o &s;hocked at her illne&s;s, that &s;he was &s;eized with fits; no one was near her, but my&s;elf, and I was per&s;uaded that her death was occa&s;ioned by a cordial with &s;ome drug, that a phy&s;ician of the Baron, had prepar|ed; of this I was convinced, by a conver&s;ation that I heard between them; and I then di&s;cov|ered that the infant's life would the next morning be &s;acrificed, as well as the mother's, as the doc|tor promi&s;ed to put it to &s;leep before the Count and Counte&s;s DE LAUNA could be appri&s;ed of this event. I looked at the little creature, then a&s;leep in my lap, and while I wept over it, I vow|ed to &s;ave it if po&s;&s;ible; I had no time to lo&s;e, the old valet was hone&s;t, in him I could confide, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by him, I that night left the Chatteau, and conveyed my infant charge to a Cottage, a few leagues di&s;tant; we knew that we were un|&s;afe; we could not reach the Counte&s;s DE LAU|NA, without certain ruin; we retired to a greater di&s;tance and in a large fore&s;t, in the ho&s;pitable Cottage of a worthy pair, we became boarders. It was &s;everal months, before I ven|tured to make any inquiries; I then found that the late Count DE LAUNA was dead; that the Counte&s;s was di&s;tracted, and that the Marquis
<PB N="267" REF="039134_0263_1013B22C00897B50">
  was &s;till in Spain; that the Baron had taken the title of Count DE LAUNA, and that it was report|ed, and believed, my infant charge had died with her mother. This re&s;olved me to continue where I was, which I did until JULIA was &s;ixteen years old; I then thought it was time to find her friends, and I left my retreat; my inquiries for you and the Counte&s;s betrayed me; and the per&s;on, in whom I had in &s;ome mea&s;ure confided, was one that was employed by the Count; I re|turned as u&s;ual to the Cottage, flu&s;hed with the news; that I heard I was indeed &s;o impo&s;ed upon, that I had nearly ruined my&s;elf by telling JULIA, and the per&s;on that deceived me, the &s;ecret of her birth, and retreat; I had always pa&s;&s;ed as her mother, and called the faithful valet my father; but I was now &s;o impatient to tell the dear girl, who &s;he really was, that nothing but a con&s;idera|tion, that it might eventually injure her, prevent|ed. I left her with the a&s;&s;urance, that all &s;hould be unravelled the next day, and with a charge not to leave the Cottage. I forgot to mention that upon the death of the old people who owned the Cottage, we &s;old the jewels, and purcha&s;ed it, this happened when JULIA was but two years old. Upon my arrival at the hou&s;e, I had ap|pointed to meet my informer, I was &s;eized by &s;everal men and threatened with death, if I did not di&s;cover where the child was, that I had &s;tol|en in her infancy; but I bid defiance to their threats and was proof again&s;t their per&s;ua&s;ions; I was carried to the Count's Chatteau, and con|fined there, for two years; every artifice was u&s;ed to tempt me to di&s;cover where my trea&s;ure was; wealth, honors, and power were promi&s;ed, if I
<PB N="268" REF="039134_0264_1013B22D828CBD90">
  gave her up; but on the contrary, perpetual im|pri&s;onment, with famine, and filth was the mi&s;|eries that &s;hould attend me through life, if I re|fu&s;ed. But I &s;corned them all, and in the end triumphed; one thing I &s;ucceeded in, which was having an adverti&s;ement in&s;erted, in &s;everal of the public papers, which I had written with a view to quiet the fears of JULIA; a crown pre|vailed on one of my gaolers to &s;end it to the printers, and he was removed from his care of me, upon its being di&s;covered.</P>
  <P>The education I had given JULIA, had taught her, to conquer her curio&s;ity, to employ all her time, to be re&s;igned and contented, in all &s;itua|tions; I had taught her to reverence the Deity, to obey his commands; to do all the good &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could to her fellow creatures. I knew the&s;e principles were &s;o engraven upon her heart, that mi&s;fortunes could not &s;hake them, nor bad example era&s;e them. I knew her temper was &s;weet and mild; her di&s;po&s;ition, &s;oft, ju&s;t, and humane. I knew that her mind was filled with noble and refined &s;entiments; that &s;he had a pu|rity of heart; a rectitude of thought &s;eldom to be met with; that &s;he had real fortitude, and not one particle of pride or vanity; reflecting upon her virtues, &s;o like her mother's, gave me comfort. The old valet was as good, as hone&s;ty it&s;elf, he was old, but healthy, and I doubted not that &s;he would be re&s;tored to her friends and me.</P>
  <P>At the end of two years, two painful &s;olitary years, I was removed from the Chatteau to Paris; this gentleman was appointed to take care of me; he pitied my misfortunes; the tran&s;ition from pi|ty to love, is &s;mall; we &s;oon contracted a mutual

  attachment, and I promi&s;ed to become his wife, if he would effect my e&s;cape; we &s;ucceeded, and retired for a few weeks from the kingdom; but before we left France, the holy prie&s;t joined our hands; in a very &s;hort time my hu&s;band receiv|ed a letter, informing him of the death of the Count DE LAUNA, and of the &s;earch that the Marquis had made for me, as my motives for con|cealment were at an end, and I wi&s;hed for no|thing more, than to inform you, my Lord, of the circum&s;tances that I have now related; and if po&s;&s;ible, pre&s;ent your daughter to you; we &s;et off for France immediately, and were on our way to the Villa, when I heard in Paris you were gone, the &s;torm obliged us to take &s;helter here, and here my pur&s;uit is ended, for I have here found the dear object of my hopes; and found her ju&s;t what I wi&s;hed her, ri&s;ing &s;uperior to mi&s;fortunes, and e&s;caped from the &s;nares that vice and perfidy had laid for her, and in re&s;igning her to you, my Lord, as a rich ble&s;&s;ing, I ful|fil the dying commands of my beloved and re|&s;pected lady."</P></Q>
<P>Here I&s;abella fini&s;hed her narrative, which had &s;he followed the dictates of her own heart, &s;he would have rendered it more lengthy and affecting; but in pity to the Marquis, &s;he &s;urpre&s;&s;|ed many circum&s;tances, that &s;he knew would on|ly &s;erve to di&s;tre&s;s him. But the intelligence, excepting what related to JULIA, was not new to him; Philada had before given her opinion, and indeed the Count's confe&s;&s;ion, had rendered the matter certain. The Marquis could never think of his wife's untimely end, without grief of heart, nor of his &s;on, without agony; yet to find a

daughter, the exact re&s;emblance of her mother, who inherited with it all her beauties, her virtues, and her accompli&s;hments, was a balm, to his wounded heart, and &s;oothed all his &s;orrows; he embraced her, with tears of tender love, and a&s;|&s;ured, her he found in her, a rich reward for all his &s;ufferings. And then turning to the faithful woman, who had thus pre&s;erved her; it is not in my power, (&s;aid he,) to repay the debt I owe you, for your uncea&s;ing love, to my amiable, la|mented wife; and for pre&s;erving this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure, my child; but I &s;hall con&s;ider you, and your hu&s;band, as my be&s;t friends, and will as &s;oon as I arrive at my &s;i&s;ters, make &s;uch a &s;ettlement as &s;hall &s;ecure ea&s;e and affluence to your&s;elves and heirs. And you Madam, (&s;aid he) addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Madam De Shong, may from this mo|ment bid adieu to every difficulty, that wealth can remove. Stop, &s;top, my good brother, (&s;aid the Counte&s;s) and do not in your joy di&s;cover &s;o engro&s;&s;ing a di&s;po&s;ition, I demand this venerable, and worthy woman, as my &s;hare of ble&s;&s;ings, &s;he &s;hall have an equal right with my&s;elf to ev|ery thing I po&s;&s;e&s;s; and I reque&s;t that &s;he will leave this village with us tomorrow, to re&s;ide with me, an honored friend, and re&s;pected com|panion; I &s;hall con&s;ider my&s;elf accountable for the education, and fortune of her grand-daughter. Ah my friends, (cried Madam) how greatly is my old age ble&s;&s;ed, beyond my de&s;ert, or expecta|tions. I &s;hall grow too fond of life; but I de|&s;ire to be grateful to you all, and grateful to Hea|ven who has given you wealth and hearts to ren|der it &s;o beneficial to your fellow creatures.&mdash;But (&s;aid Ro&s;well) I find I am to be cheated intire|ly,
<PB N="271" REF="039134_0267_1013B236DE6BFE90">
and you Madam are looking out for others to make happy, and quite neglect your poor coun|tryman; but I acquie&s;ce, and rejoice in this gene|ral joy. A joy, (replied JULIA) we &s;hould never have known but for you, and amid&s;t all the&s;e friends, &s;o honoured, &s;o beloved, and to whom I am &s;o obliged, not one has a &s;tronger claim on my gratitude, and e&s;teem; for I was an outca&s;t, and you took me in; di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and you relieved me; afflicted, and you comforted me; but tho' I want words to &s;peak my gratitude of all the&s;e fa|vours, yet my heart feels all, and is now bur&s;ting with a &s;en&s;e of them.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t leave a conver&s;ation, that we can|not give at full length, and let the imagination conceive the feelings that cannot be de&s;cribed. It was late when they parted for the night; and when JULIA laid her head upon the pillow, a va|riety of contending &s;en&s;ations, concurred to pre|vent re&s;t. Her joy that &s;he had found a father, noble, rich, and worthy, who&s;e heart was over|flowing with tenderne&s;s towards her; that &s;he had in the Counte&s;s met a friend that had long loved her as a child, and was happy to acknow|ledge her as a kin&s;woman, who approved of all her conduct, and cleared her of the &s;hadow of blame. She had found too the woman, who had been a mother to her in her infancy, who had &s;aved her life, and had implanted in her bo|&s;om the love of virtue, and hatred of vice. The wealth of her father put it in her power, to repay every favor &s;he had received; to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor; to comfort the afflicted; and to cheer the aching heart; but amid&s;t all the&s;e new found ble&s;&s;ings, &s;he was unhappy, and &s;he found that in the arms

of affluence, in the lap of luxury, and in the bo|&s;om of benevolence, &s;he could be wretched; for COLWORT was not found; he was probably &s;uffering a rigorous confinement, that his affec|tions for her had occa&s;ioned; and perhaps death would be the &s;ad, the dreadful con&s;equence; the&s;e reflections prevented her enjoyment, and with a &s;igh, &s;he acknowledged &s;he could never know quiet.</P>

<P>EARLY the next forenoon, they left the Village, after &s;atisfying every demand, that could be made upon Madam De Shong; and JULIA liberally rewarded the humanity of the girl, who had pre&s;ented the picture for &s;ale, and who&s;e feel|ings were &s;o powerfully operated upon, by the &s;ufferings of her&s;elf and friend; the old maid &s;erv|ant, who had been much attached to her mi&s;tre&s;s, was again taken into her &s;ervice, and followed in a carriage, with the waiting woman of the Count|e&s;s. They called and took up the little Maria; and though Mr. ROSWELL longed to be on his way to England, yet he accompanied them to the Villa, as he was anxious to &s;ee Madam De
<PB N="273" REF="039134_0269_1013B23B4F48C3F8">
Shong &s;ettled in her new habitation, and JULIA was &s;o earne&s;t in her per&s;ua&s;ion to &s;ee him there; the rewards were &s;o ample to all that had been kind to the late &s;uffering, now wealthy Madam De Shong and JULIA, that the mean and little minded, regretted that they had been want|ing in genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>Before evening they arrived &s;afely at the Villa, and were greeted by all its inhabitants with ac|clamations of joy. Annet hung round JULIA, with a joy that her little heart had never known before. The porter had before this been a&s;ham|ed of his brutality to JULIA; the reflection and taunts of his fellow &s;ervants had puni&s;hed him; but before her arrival the me&s;&s;age from the Count|e&s;s, had convinced him how unacceptable his conduct would be to that lady; he now a&s;ked her pardon, with a &s;ervility that always proves the little mind, and JULIA who never felt anger for an hour together, a&s;&s;ured him it was forgot|ten.</P>
<P>One of her fir&s;t cares was to enquire for the Chevalier St. Armond, but the letter from Oli|via had been burnt with her cloaths, though &s;he recollected the contents; but her father removed her difficulties, and thought it not nece&s;&s;ary to apply to the Chevalier; he pre&s;ented Donna Olivia, with an e&s;tate that &s;upplied her with ev|ery wi&s;h of her heart. By this time Convents in France were nearly annihilated, and in a few months &s;he di&s;po&s;ed of that e&s;tate, and returned to England, where the remainder of her days are pa&s;&s;ing in ea&s;e and retirement.</P>
<P>The Marquis put I&s;abella and her hu&s;band in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;um that rendered their lives ea&s;y,
<PB N="274" REF="039134_0270_1013B23F2F42FFC0">
affluent, and free from anxiety. Madam De Shong cho&s;e, with her little girl, to be a depend|ant upon the bounty of the Counte&s;s, and that lady and JULIA, continued to pay her every at|tention that her merits and her misfortunes en|titled her to. The Marquis, at the reque&s;t of his daughter, &s;ent for Philada, that &s;he who &s;o well loved his wife, might &s;pend her old age, in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her daughter, freed from the cares and bu&s;ine&s;s that &s;he had &s;o faithfully per|formed, and Jaques became what he &s;o much wi&s;hed to be, a footman to JULIA, who took care that his wages &s;hould be &s;o large, as to ena|ble him to &s;ave a moiety every year; his &s;ervices were ea&s;y, and he was treated rather as an hum|ble friend, than a dome&s;tic; while his mother was happy in being always near the child of her beloved Marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>Ro&s;well, &s;pent only a few days with them, im|patient to embrace his mother and his Lucretia; he left the friends he loved and e&s;teemed, (and of who&s;e happine&s;s he had been &s;o in&s;trumental,) with regret, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a corre&s;pondence with them, which they agreed, &s;hould la&s;t forev|er.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed in the &s;ociety of a parent and aunt, that e&s;teemed her their choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ing; the pride and ornament of them both, with full power to gratify the benevolent feelings of her heart; &s;e|cured of ea&s;e and affluence, in the full enjoyment of friend&s;hip, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every virtue, JU|LIA wondered, &s;he was not happy, but whenev|er her thoughts turned towards COLWORT, which they did continually, &s;he was con&s;cious of the mo&s;t agonizing feelings. Every &s;earch had been
<PB N="275" REF="039134_0271_1013B240B10EF9A8">
made for him, without effect; letters from Eng|land informed them, he had not been heard of, and every enquiry proved equally fruitle&s;s. One whole year, had pa&s;&s;ed off in this &s;tate of uncer|tainty, and in that time, JULIA's hand was &s;ought by &s;ome of the fir&s;t men in the kingdom. Her beauty, goodne&s;s, and talents were of a nature &s;o alluring, &s;o charming, that it was impo&s;&s;ible not to love and admire her; but con&s;idered as the only child, of the Marquis, heire&s;s of the va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of him, and the Counte&s;s; &s;he was an object of &s;uch importance, as to draw the wealthy and the noble from the remote&s;t parts of France; but &s;he did not he&s;itate to confe&s;s her&s;elf engag|ed, and in her refu&s;al of their love, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf of their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>It would have been plea&s;ing to the Marquis and her aunt, if &s;he could have made an election from her numerous admirers; they did not pre&s;s her to do a thing that could for a moment add to the pangs &s;he evidently &s;uffered, though &s;he &s;trove to conceal them.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t a year had expired, when the Counte&s;s received a letter from the daughter of Madam Gyron, informing her that lady was rapidly de|clining, and the phy&s;icians had cea&s;ed to flatter her with the hopes of recovery, and one of her la&s;t wi&s;hes was, to &s;ee Madam DE LAUNA, before her death, whom &s;he now be&s;ought to vi&s;it her at Paris. Though the Counte&s;s had no wi&s;h to leave her charming retreat, &s;he could not refu&s;e a reque&s;t, that was evidently the fruits of af|fection. The Marquis cho&s;e not to leave the Villa at &s;o warm a &s;ea&s;on of the year, yet he in|&s;i&s;ted, that his daughter, &s;hould accompany his
<PB N="276" REF="039134_0272_1013B24356F5E630">&s;i&s;ter, and leave him, in the care of Madam de Shong, and Maria; though JULIA felt unwill|ing to quit a parent, &s;he &s;o revered, yet &s;he o|beyed his wi&s;hes, and &s;et out with the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>They arrived at Paris, but three days before the death of Madam Gyron, who was con&s;oled to have an opportunity, to &s;ee, and take leave of her friends, and directly after her interment, they left Paris and &s;et out for the Villa.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the &s;econd day, they put up at an inn upon the road; the evening was uncom|monly charming; a bright and lovely moon, had ari&s;en, ju&s;t as the &s;un had withdrawn its rays; the day had been remarkably warm, but a &s;oft and delicious coolne&s;s entered at two large win|dows, and refre&s;hed the air. In a frame of mind rather formed for pen&s;ive &s;adne&s;s, than conver&s;a|tion, the Counte&s;s had ordered the candles to be taken away, that they might enjoy the moon, and in a few moments they were &s;o occupied by their own reflections, as not to heed the entrance of &s;ome per&s;ons, who came in to an adjoining apartment which was only &s;eparated from that in which they &s;at, by a callico curtain, that hung &s;u&s;pended from the ceiling. After a &s;hort time however, their attention was forcibly drawn by the following conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>My friend, (&s;aid one of the &s;trangers,) is now enjoying a &s;weet, and profound &s;leep; the fir&s;t he has been ble&s;t with for &s;ome days; while that is the ca&s;e, do &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity and tell me, what has brought you to France in the&s;e times of trouble, and confu&s;ion; to &s;atisfy a dying friend, (replied the other,) I have left London, and to &s;atisfy you, I will give you an account of
<PB N="277" REF="039134_0273_1013B24668891340">
the cau&s;e of my journey. It is now near thirty years &s;ince the Earl of Ormond, &s;ent his elde&s;t &s;on, to &s;pend &s;ome time in France; an antient friend&s;hip had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the family of Ormond, and Maravalda; the young gentleman was recommended to the Marquis, and treated with the utmo&s;t ho&s;pitality at his Chatteau, where the family then re&s;ided, and which he was de&s;ired to con&s;ider as his home, while he contin|ued on the Continent; the Marquis had an only daughter, a very lovely girl, of about fifteen; a mutual attachment, was the con&s;equence of a con&s;tant intercour&s;e, and the young people got married, without con&s;ulting friends, on either &s;ide; &s;hortly after the&s;e private nuptials, the young Lord was recalled, and when he informed his father of the connection, he had formed, he found him ab&s;olutely aver&s;e to his proceedings, upon the account of the young lady's being edu|cated in the Roman Catholic Religion, and as he found his endeavours, to alter his &s;on's mind but vain, he impo&s;ed upon him with an account of her death. Lord William, the &s;econd &s;on, went to France him&s;elf, and in concent with the young lady's mother, who was equally aver&s;e to the match, as &s;he had been by her parents engag|ed to the Count DE LAUNA, &s;he was likewi&s;e deceived, and led to believe that Lord Henry had died, &s;oon after his arrival in England; but the lady was pregnant, and the fruits of this im|prudent attachment, was put into Lord William's hands, that he might be educated in England. In the cour&s;e of the voyage, the idea was &s;ugge&s;t|ed to him, to bring up the little boy, a &s;tranger
<PB N="278" REF="039134_0274_1013B24A2AD915F0">
to his birth, and conceal, if po&s;&s;ible, the whole af|fair; he was well acquainted with his brother's &s;trong attachment, and he thought it probable, that he would never marry, and by concealing the child, he &s;ecured to him&s;elf, without di&s;pute, his brother's fortune, as well as title. The boy, was delivered to a wealthy merchant, who was intru&s;ted with the &s;ecret, and who brought him up as the &s;on of a decea&s;ed brother; thus he has grown up in ignorance of him&s;elf; but de|ceits are &s;eldom pro&s;pered; Lord William, by the death of his father and brother, without heirs, came into quiet, and undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fortune, and honors of his family; tho' he has been twice married; he has never had a child. He is now in a very alarming &s;tate of health, his con&s;cience, has become a trouble&s;ome monitor, and I am &s;ent over to vi&s;it the Counte&s;s DE LAU|NA, for &s;he is the mother of the young man, and to a&s;k her pardon for the deception that has been practi&s;ed upon her.</P>
<P>It was with the utmo&s;t difficulty, that the Counte&s;s re&s;trained her&s;elf, but her agitation was &s;o great as to betray her, for her impatience was incontroulable; with hands cla&s;ped together, &s;he aro&s;e, and exclaimed, where is my &s;on, tell me if I have a child; Oh tell me. She could walk but a few &s;teps, and &s;unk into a chair, while her quick, and convul&s;ive &s;obs, declared the agitated &s;tate of her mind; JULIA with trembling hands was rubbing her temples, and in a faint voice beg|ging her to be calm. The &s;ervant entered with lights, and the gentleman who had heard the ex|clamation, came into the room; it was &s;ome time
<PB N="279" REF="039134_0275_1013B24BAC734D90">
before &s;he appeared to take any notice of tho&s;e a|round her, and JULIA dreading the intire lo&s;s of her rea&s;on; informed the per&s;ons, who &s;he was, and begged them to give her an account, as fa|vorable as po&s;&s;ible, when &s;he recovered her recol|lection. Indeed, &s;he had &s;truggled &s;o long with contending pa&s;&s;ions, it was no wonder that a variety of painful emotions bur&s;ting at once up|on her, reduced her to an alarming &s;ituation; by degrees &s;he came intirely to her&s;elf, and for &s;ome time &s;eemed to be endeavouring to recollect her&s;elf. How are you my dear Madam, (&s;aid JULIA?) Why, well my child. Has any thing been the matter, (cried the Counte&s;s in a weak voice?) Oh, now I remember; where are tho&s;e per&s;ons, JULIA, that were in the next room, for &s;urely, I have not dreamed? No, (my dear Ma|dam,) you have not, and when you are compo&s;|ed, tho&s;e gentlemen will inform you of every thing you can wi&s;h to know. I am calm, I am compo&s;ed my dear; Oh tell me, if indeed I am &s;o ble&s;&s;ed as to have a &s;on. After &s;ome he&s;ita|tion, the gentleman informed her, his errand was intirely to her, and begged to know if &s;he could forgive the Earl. If my &s;on is living, (&s;aid &s;he) from my &s;oul, I can forgive that cruel family all the evils I have received at their hands. He was living a few months &s;ince, &s;aid the gentle|man, his nominal uncle, received a letter from him; then he is not dead &s;he interrupted? I hope not, Madam, (he replied,) he left England &s;ome time ago, to vi&s;it this country; I have promi&s;ed his uncle, if po&s;&s;ible to find him, and pre&s;ent him to you, one of the mo&s;t amiable

young men, and one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed in the world. A thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings on you, for this kind, benevolent intention, (cried the Count|e&s;s;) but tell me, &s;ome clue by which I may find him, what name does he bear? by what ti|tle &s;hall I addre&s;s him, except by that of my &s;on? His uncle, Madam, (&s;aid the &s;tranger,) called him <HI>Francis Colwort.</HI> Gracious Heaven, exclaimed the Counte&s;s, it was my &s;on! Oh, my dear Mad|am, reiterated JULIA, Mr. COLWORT was your &s;on. COLWORT (interrupted the other gentle|man,) COLWORT, did you &s;ay, Frank. I did; Oh, I have known him, (cried the di&s;tracted mo|ther;) known him to be the be&s;t, and worthie&s;t of men; Heaven &s;ent him to &s;ave his mother's life, and even then my heart acknowledged him, as mine, but gracious Heaven, I have lo&s;t him forever. Do not thus mi&s;tru&s;t the goodne&s;s of Providence, (&s;aid the &s;tranger,) how long &s;ince you have &s;een him? It is now two years &s;ince he left the Villa; a year ago he was living, but I have too much rea&s;on to form the mo&s;t dreadful fears. Take courage, Madam, it is not one fort|night &s;ince he was living; and the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA, and a Madamoi&s;elle Vallace where the con&s;tant themes of his hopes and fears. Then he is &s;till alive, (cried JULIA, &s;miling through her tears,) and we &s;hall yet be happy. Put an end to my &s;u&s;pence, (&s;aid the Counte&s;s) for I can bear it no longer; tell me where he is. The gentleman then begged her to be calm, and with great caution informed her that about two months &s;ince, he had found COLWORT, who was his mo&s;t dear and intimate friend, a clo&s;e
<PB N="281" REF="039134_0277_10136EB9D0E604F0">
pri&s;oner in the carmagnole, that he had found his way to him, and by the power of gold, and a little flattery to the keeper; he had effected his e&s;cape; that they were on their way to the Villa when he was taken &s;ick, and had not yet recover|ed. Where is he, (interrupted the Counte&s;s,) tell me where he is, that I may fly to attend him, for who is &s;o fit as a mother, to be about the &s;ick bed of her &s;on? Not to night, Madam, he is too weak, &s;uch a meeting would overcome him, and undo all that my care has effected; he is in this very hou&s;e, in the care of people who&s;e duty, and bu&s;ine&s;s it is to attend upon him; but great cau|tion mu&s;t be u&s;ed to introduce you to his cham|ber. When the Counte&s;s heard that her &s;on was in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her, &s;he would have gone directly to him, but for the prudence of his friend; and after a few moments reflection, &s;he con&s;ented to be guided by him.</P>
<P>But nothing could prevent her from &s;pending the night in an apartment next to his chamber, with JULIA; when the door was opened &s;he could hear him turn upon his bed, di&s;tingui&s;h his breath, and his faint voice when he a&s;ked for the medicine. It was near day when he &s;eemed to be quite awake from a refre&s;hing &s;lumber; his friend who had &s;et by him, then informed him that an Equipage with many attendants had ar|rived there the night before, and the &s;ervants were informed, it belonged to the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA; he pau&s;ed, and COLWORT, with &s;ome impatience inquired if he &s;aw the per&s;ons who came in the carriage. His friend told him, he had &s;een two ladies, and had rea&s;on to think one

was the Counte&s;s, but the other appeared young and hand&s;ome. The agitation of COLWORT, rendered him &s;o inqui&s;itive, that he at length owned JULIA was with the Counte&s;s, in the hou&s;e, and that he would at their ri&s;ing, reque&s;t them to pay a vi&s;it to the &s;ick chamber; it was then that the returning pride of COLWORT, gave his friend new hopes, he was anxious to appear well, and even hand&s;ome, before JULIA; per|haps his illne&s;s had weakened his mind, as well as his per&s;on, for could a man be vain; could he wi&s;h to be hand&s;ome?</P>
<P>When the &s;un aro&s;e, the gentleman left the room, and COLWORT kept his eyes fixed on the door, and waited his return, with great impa|tience; in le&s;s than ten minutes he beheld him enter with tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;o beloved, &s;o long wi&s;h|ed for; he &s;tretched out his hand to them, and the Counte&s;s and JULIA &s;tationed them&s;elves at the &s;ides of his bed, and endeavored to articulate &s;ome kind enquiry, or &s;ome affectionate que&s;tion; but their lips refu&s;ed to do ju&s;tice to the feelings of their hearts, and their tears and looks could on|ly expre&s;s their emotion. In a few moments the phy&s;ician arrived, and in a mode&s;t, but deci&s;ive manner, pronounced the patient out of dan|ger, but declared him &s;till &s;o weak as to require great care, and attention; the ladies laid an em|bargo upon their lips, le&s;t he &s;hould be injured, but &s;at by him the whole day, and though the Counte&s;s longed to call him &s;on, longed to pre&s;s him to her maternal bo&s;om, her di&s;cretion over|came her impatience, and &s;he waited until con|firmed health &s;hould authori&s;e &s;uch a di&s;covery.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="039134_0279_1013B25595ACD7E8">
The next day he was amazingly better, for to the kind attentions of friend&s;hip, was added the &s;oothing cares of love, and his medicines opera|ted more kindly when pre&s;ented by JULIA, or her aunt, then when given by his friend; he &s;at up &s;ome time, and enjoyed their &s;ociety. In three days the gentleman from England made his appearance, COLWORT was rejoiced, but &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee him; a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions re&s;pecting his friends at home, and as he was par|ticularly attached to him, related every occur|rence, that had happened to him. In an&s;wer to this information, the gentleman told him, he had a very wonderful &s;tory to relate re&s;pecting him&s;elf, which required &s;teady attention, and more fortitude, than he appeared at pre&s;ent to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Thus prefaced, he told him every cir|cum&s;tance, concealing only the name of the Counte&s;s, and at the end, told him he had been &s;o fortunate, as to di&s;cover his mother, who was rich, and amiable, and would with joy receive him as her &s;on, on one condition, which, was that he con&s;ented to marry her niece, that &s;he tend|erly loved, and who would be heire&s;s to a noble fortune. If that is the condition, (&s;aid COLWORT, with energy,) &s;he will never acknowledge me; my faith is pledged; and if this change, in my &s;itua|tion, has effected a change in JULIA VALLACE, I will never marry, I would die to &s;erve or plea&s;e a parent; the name of mother vibrates upon my ear, and is dear to my heart, but if a mother, I have never known, can wi&s;h the only pledge of an unfortunate attachment, to violate his mo&s;t &s;acred engagement, I fear I could never love her
<PB N="284" REF="039134_0280_1013B25717AB4F98">
as I ought. But (&s;aid the gentleman,) if Madam|oi&s;elle &s;hould happen to be the niece, and the Counte&s;s the mother. Ah, (&s;aid COLWORT,) am I &s;o ble&s;&s;ed, can I have &s;uch a mother? Have I &s;uch a &s;on, &s;aid the Counte&s;s? (Embracing him with tenderne&s;s.) Yes my &s;on, you are my child, and without one condition, I receive you to my heart, and thank Heaven for &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing; but to the reader's imagination, the remainder of the &s;cene mu&s;t be referred.</P>
<P>In a few days, Mr. COLWORT, now Francis Ormond, was able to leave the inn; his two friends at the invitation of his mother, accompa|nied him to the Villa, where they found the Marquis impatient to receive his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on. Smiles of real chearfulne&s;s, and heartfelt &s;atisfac|tion, once more revi&s;ited the countenance, and animated the features of JULIA; the whole family participated in her joy, and her nuptials were &s;olemnized directly after her return. By this time the troubles in France had gained &s;uch a cri&s;is, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for every friend to order, for every lover of peace and religion, to leave that ill-fated nation. The principles of the Illuminata triumphed; anarchy, confu&s;ion, cru|elty, and blood&s;hed &s;ucceeded; and the Mar|quis was, though old and infirm, pitched upon as a victim; but being nearly related to &s;ome per&s;ons, then in power, who had not yet lo&s;t ev|ery &s;en&s;e of humanity, he was &s;o fortunate as to leave the kingdom, and with the Counte&s;s DE LAUNA, having di&s;po&s;ed of their e&s;tates much under their real value, tran&s;mitted the money to England, whither they retired with all their &s;ervants, Madam DE SHONG, I&s;abella, and her hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="039134_0281_1013B259E55C06A0">
The care and attention of their &s;on, and daughter, &s;oftened the fatigues of the voyage.&mdash;And the philanthropy which reigned in their bo&s;oms, rendered them literally citizens of the world; they regarded France de&s;poiled of all her virtues, no longer as their country, and carrying with them, all they held dear, London &s;oon be|came agreeable.</P>
<P>They were received by the Earl of Ormond, with a mingled plea&s;ure and remor&s;e; he now approached the confines of the grave, and gave up tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions without regret, which he had been guilty of deceit to obtain. The Counte&s;s was too happy in her &s;on's merits and accom|pli&s;hments, to harbour any re&s;entment again&s;t his uncle, and a perfect reconciliation preceded his death, which event took place in le&s;s than one month after their arrival; he left the whole of his e&s;tate, and ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to his nephew; his title de&s;cended to a di&s;tant branch of the family, as the marriage of the Counte&s;s, and the father of her &s;on, was certainly illegal; and Or|mond and JULIA preferred the claim of virtue and benevolence, to that of rank, and the title of plain Mr. and Mrs. Ormond was more plea&s;ing, and vibrated with more delight upon their hearts, than Earl and Counte&s;s, with half a dozen right honorables at the end of them. Old Mr. COL|WORT, who had acted rather as a parent, than an uncle, to his nominal nephew, was one of the fir&s;t who greeted them with a welcome in Eng|land; the affection which he felt for him, was returned, and gratitude for reciprocal favours had bound the ties of friend&s;hip &s;o clo&s;ely, that
<PB N="286" REF="039134_0282_1013B25B6D89A760">
nothing but the la&s;t &s;igh can extingui&s;h it. His daughter whom Ormond had brought from A|merica, accompanied her father; anxious to &s;ee one, whom &s;he con&s;idered as her be&s;t friend and deliverer; and to pay her re&s;pects to that JULIA whom &s;he had admired and loved from his de&s;crip|tion; nor was her pre-&s;entiment in her favour le&s;|&s;ened by acquaintance; for JULIA ever fond of the unfortunate, carre&s;&s;ed, and cheri&s;hed her with affection, that increa&s;ed every hour,</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ROSWELL heard of the arrival of his friends, he left his pari&s;h and family, to bid them welcome, and certainly no one out of their own circle was more de&s;ervedly dear. His Lucretia had crowned his happine&s;s; his mother was well, and both longed to &s;ee and embrace tho&s;e who&s;e virtues they e&s;timated &s;o highly. He informed them, that a large e&s;tate which lay within two miles of his neat and convenient par&s;onage, was now to be &s;old, and as the Ormond &s;eat was in its vicin|ity, he urged them &s;o &s;trongly to purcha&s;e it, that the pro&s;pect of being his neighbour pre|vailed; and the Marquis immediately conclud|ed the purcha&s;e; they then retired, and the two hou&s;es became alternately the re&s;idence of the family; the hu&s;band of I&s;abella, as he was the friend of the family, now became their joint &s;tewart; Madam DE SHONG was in&s;ured all the conveniencies of life, and all its elegancies; and the con&s;tant intercour&s;e that was kept up be|tween ROSWELL, and his amiable wife, as it in|crea&s;ed all their plea&s;ures, &s;weetened the remain|ing days of that excellent woman.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="039134_0283_1013B25F69DEC000">
Not long after their &s;ettlement JULIA was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to receive a vi&s;it from CARLOS; &s;he found that young man, as good as ever, delighted with her happine&s;s, and cured of a pa&s;&s;ion, that he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> found hopele&s;s. The daughter of Mr. COLWORT was at that time on a vi&s;it at the grove; &s;he had recovered her beauty and her &s;pirits, and the generous Spaniard felt the force of her charms, he frankly confe&s;&s;ed that he had once loved JU|LIA, and now offered a heart that had been &s;en|&s;ible of the power of a tender attachment; as this had been the ca&s;e with the lady, &s;he could make no rea&s;onable objection; and urged by her father, by ORMOND and JULIA, per&s;uaded by the Counte&s;s, and her brother, &s;he con&s;ented that Mr. ROSWEL &s;hould perform the ceremony of marriage at the grove; a ceremony that render|ed the &s;ucceeding days of both, as happy as is con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate &s;ubjected to the changes of mortality.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at the time of this wedding, Mr. Ormond was &s;ummoned up to London, to vi&s;it a convict that had received &s;entence of death for a murder; when he was introduced to the unhappy man, he found a per&s;on he had never &s;een before; but the my&s;tery was &s;oon unravelled; the wretch con|fe&s;&s;ed he was the phy&s;ician who had pre&s;ented a poi&s;oned cup to the Marchione&s;s, and who by mi&s;take had been the cau&s;e of the Count's death. He declared him&s;elf innocent of the crime for which he was about to &s;uffer, but thought the vengeance of heaven had overtaken him, for his former iniquities. The confe&s;&s;ion he made re|&s;pecting the Illuminata and their horrid de&s;igns
<PB N="288" REF="039134_0284_1013B26375CC5AA8">
upon the Marquis; &s;et their characters and prin|ciples, in a light too &s;hocking to be delineated. ORMOND ju&s;tly &s;truck with their enormities, thanked heaven, that he had e&s;caped with tho&s;e he loved, from a country, that had become the nur&s;ery of this horde of vipers. He a&s;&s;ured the unhappy man of his, and the family's forgiv|ne&s;s, and left him to &s;uffer the &s;entence of the law. Once more fixed at Ormond-grove, we will leave him, and his JULIA, delighting to do good, and to &s;pread around them the ble&s;&s;ings they enjoy; to render happy the unfortunate; to &s;often the &s;orrows of the afflicted; to clothe the naked; to feed the hungry, and to diffu&s;e cheerfulne&s;s and plenty, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives.</P>
<P>The Marquis and his &s;i&s;ter are happy in the &s;ociety of the mo&s;t affectionate, and mo&s;t duti|ful of children, and already have the plea&s;ure to &s;ee the blooming and amiab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">le JUIA the mother of two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine children, and while ORMOND thinks he &s;ees the beauty of his wife in her lovely little girl, &s;he fondly perceives the manly graces of her hu&s;band, in her &s;prightly boy.</P>
