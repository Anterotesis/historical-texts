<Q><BIBL>PROV. XVI.6.</BIBL>
<P>By Mercy and Truth Iniquity is purged.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a point e&s;tabli&s;hed by the rea&s;on of mankind, and by the divine authority of the holy &s;criptures, that the glory of God is his ultimate end in all his works, of creation, providence, and grace. No higher end can po&s;&s;ibly be propo&s;ed, and all rea&s;onable beings mu&s;t be allowed to act upon the highe&s;t princi|ples, and mo&s;t exalted views. God is the fir&s;t cau&s;e and la&s;t end of all things.</P>
<P>And as his glory is his end in all his works, &s;o he is &s;ure never to be baffled in his de&s;igns, nor fru&s;trated in any of his means devi&s;ed for his own glory. His wi&s;|dom counterplots, and his power controuls, all the coun|&s;els of men or devils, and maketh their wrath to prai&s;e him.&mdash;A remarkable in&s;tance in mankind&mdash;Sinners. Our fir&s;t father &s;inned, and came &s;hort of the glory of God; lo&s;t the moral image and favour of God; and it &s;eemed as if God had made mankind in vain. But <HI>O the depth of the riches both of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God!</HI> Man's apo&s;tacy is God's opportunity to declare his glory, and &s;hew the exceeding riches of wi&s;dom and grace.&mdash;Divine mercy hitherto hid in God from angels and men, now appears to both; free abundant mercy and divine pity to the mi&s;erable. Now &s;hall mercy be built up forever, and God will declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, by the great propitiation, and through the tender mercies of our God. Yea, God will
<PB N="4" REF="011299_0003_0F869F6DB7DD29A8">
exalt him&s;elf in all the di&s;plays of unmerited grace, and &s;hew forth the glory of holine&s;s, in a con&s;i&s;tency with mercy to &s;inners, maintain and vindicate the honor of truth, and magnify the law and make it honourable, and &s;hew him&s;elf a God in his pardoning mercy, and all without the lea&s;t wrong to his name and honour; yea, with the mo&s;t perfect harmony of all his moral attributes, in our redemption by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>A thread of ju&s;tice runs through the whole web of his admini&s;trations. Ju&s;tice and judgment are the habi|tation (or ba&s;is) of his throne. A God of truth, and without iniquity: His tender mercies are over all his work <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and truth are interwoven in the whole plan of our redemption, cordially unite in all the works of regenerating grace, and are manife&s;t in all the di&s;pen|&s;ations of divine providence towards his people.</P>
<P>And all that, by efficacious grace, are made partakers of the divine nature in its glorious properties, being re|newed in knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true holine&s;s, have in the&s;e a re&s;emblance to God, they are holy as God is holy, merciful as their Father which is in heaven is merciful; true and faithful, doing ju&s;tice, loving mer|cy, and walking humbly with their God; are imitators of God as dear children, being influenced by mercy and truth, in all their conduct in the world. And, as they have experienced the divine power of truth and mercy, they are &s;anctified through the truth, and clean through the word that Chri&s;t hath &s;poken; have an heart of fle&s;h; being tender-hearted, of a compa&s;&s;ionate and for|giving temper; and under the divine influence of mercy and truth, they go on clean&s;ing them&s;elves from all filthine&s;s, both of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, until they fini&s;h their &s;anctification in the fear of the Lord. God will &s;end forth his mercy and his truth to pre&s;erve them, and more and more purify their hearts by faith, till their iniquities &s;hall be &s;ought for and not be found. For as for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions God will fully purge them away in the blood of the Lamb, who appeared to take away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="011299_0004_0F869F6E78E5A4B0">The&s;e happily furni&s;h them with the meekne&s;s of wi&s;|dom, that wi&s;dom which is from above, which is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be entreated, full of mercies and good fruits; whereby to deal prudently, in all their endeavours for a reformation, in the land, in the churches, or in their own families.</P>
<P>We propo&s;e to give the text it's full &s;cope and latitude, &s;hewing how God by mercy and truth purges iniquity; then how we are to be herein imitators of God.</P>
<P>God purges iniquity by mercy and truth in our re|demption, in regeneration, and in his providential di&s;pen|&s;ations. Mercy and truth unite in the whole &s;cheme of our redemption, and in every line of the go&s;pel cove|nant. They both meet in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t. He is a <HI>merciful and faithful high-prie&s;t, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the &s;ins of his people:</HI> Merciful to men, and ever faithful to his Father, &s;aved the honour of divine truth, law, and ju&s;tice; and opened a way for mercy to be di&s;played, to the glory of all the other moral attributes of God. <HI>Grace and truth</HI> both <HI>came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; and mercy is built up forever; and truth, or the covenant faithfulne&s;s of God, e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in the very heavens. All his divine love and pity, in which he redeemed us, never moved him to di&s;charge one guilty &s;oul, otherwi&s;e than as &s;atisfaction be made for his offences. So he indented with the traitor: <HI>If ye &s;eek me, let the&s;e go their way,</HI> q. d. ju&s;tice requires not double payment. If the &s;urety be arre&s;ted and pay their debt, let them be di&s;charged. All the &s;ounding of his bowels and mercies never prompted him to give up the honour of truth and ju&s;tice. All his conduct on earth evinces that he was faithful to his Father, as well as merciful to mankind&mdash;&s;inners. <HI>Faithful to him that appointed him, as a &s;on over his own hou&s;e</HI>: as the <HI>faith|ful and true witne&s;s, he bare witne&s;s unto the truth,</HI> and at la&s;t &s;ealed it with his blood; yet &s;hewed all that tender pity to men, con&s;i&s;tent with un&s;haken con|&s;tancy in the truth. And though he knew well that
<PB N="6" REF="011299_0005_0F869F6F80784510">
God was gracious and merciful, &s;low unto anger, forgiving iniquity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in, yet he never made the lea&s;t motion to have him clear the guilty, by any means &s;hort of full &s;atisfaction; and thus &s;ubmitted to drink the bitter cup: <HI>Father glorify thy name; thy will be done.</HI></P>
<P>Mercy and truth are con&s;picuous in his death. Mercy beyond expre&s;&s;ion; a love &s;tronger than death, which all the waters of afflictions could not quench, nor all the floods of ungodly men drown. A love pa&s;&s;ing know|ledge. He loved the church and gave him&s;elf for it. His &s;acred regard to truth runs parallel with his dying love. Let me die the mo&s;t &s;hameful, bitter, and accur&s;ed death of the cro&s;s, rather than that divine truth be vio|lated, or the rights of ju&s;tice in the lea&s;t infringed. The &s;urety &s;uffers. There is no abatement. Truth is un|changeable. The &s;oul that &s;ins &s;hall die, and if one died for all, then all have died * in their &s;urety; and God is a ju&s;t God, and a Saviour: ju&s;t, and yet ju&s;tify|ing the ungodly: and his truth endureth throughout all generations.</P>
<P>Mercy and truth are happily united in all the great and precious promi&s;es in Chri&s;t, which are yea, and in him amen, to the glory of God. Mercy in promi&s;ing and truth in performing. God helps his &s;ervants, as ever mindful of his covenant, and in remembrance of his own mercy. God that cannot lie hath promi&s;ed. His mercy promi&s;ed to the po&s;terity of Abraham the old Canaan, his truth performed it, &s;o that there failed not ought of all the good he had promi&s;ed to I&s;rael, &s;o all the new covenant promi&s;es of pardon of &s;in, of grace and glory, are from mercy; and all the&s;e words of grace are forever &s;ettled in heaven, and God hath magnified his word above all his name, making it a &s;pecial point of his divine honour, to be as good as his word. And truth, as well as grace, will appear glorious indeed, when God has accompli&s;hed his whole work on mount Zion, and it &s;hall appear, that there hath not failed ought of all that good promi&s;ed to his true I&s;rael, in all the &s;acred volumes of the gracious covenant.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="011299_0006_0F869F6FF5C171B0">By mercy and truth God purges iniquity in regene|ration. The&s;e by the divine &s;pirit, taking hold of us, purge away our &s;inful inclinations. By mercy wrought on us, and having a &s;anctifying influence upon us, iniquity is purged away.</P>
<P>Truth fir&s;t takes hold of the con&s;cience of the unre|generate &s;inner. He is convinced by the law as a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or. And he is obliged to own, that the law, by which he is condemned, is <HI>holy, ju&s;t and good. By the law is the knowledge of &s;in. Thro' the law,</HI> he becomes <HI>dead to the law,</HI> and &s;ees nothing but de&s;truction before him, he &s;ees no po&s;&s;ible way for mercy to be di&s;played. But God from the throne of grace, &s;hews the riches of abundant mercy, and a way to di&s;play that mercy thro' the Son of his love, con&s;i&s;tent with truth and ju&s;tice: the &s;oul is then bowed to truth, and falls before the mer|cy-&s;eat, &s;prinkled with blood; approves ju&s;tice and truth in the law of God; and how &s;weet is divine mercy &s;treaming in the blood of atonement! he accepts re|demption thro' his blood, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, accord|ing to the riches of his grace; and &s;ees &s;omething of the divine wi&s;dom and prudence, in adju&s;ting matters &s;o, for our &s;alvation, as that the riches of grace are the more glorious, for flowing to &s;inners thro' the bleeding veins of a crucified Redeemer. Hence a change in the nature. Free mercy melts the &s;oul to unfeigned repentance; to become merciful and forgiving to all but him&s;elf. At the &s;ame time to reverence the truth, and adore the ju&s;|tice, and love the law of God, becau&s;e it is pure. Thus are we made partakers of the divine nature, and e&s;cape the corruption that is in the world.</P>
<P>They, that being ignorant of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and have not &s;ubmitted to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, do not unite mercy and truth, but tru&s;t to truth in a mi&s;taken &s;en&s;e, without mercy. And &s;ecure &s;inners that pre&s;ume, becau&s;e God is merciful, they &s;hall not be damned; do tru&s;t to mercy in direct contradiction to truth. They &s;ee
<PB N="8" REF="011299_0007_0F869F753B5BA208">
not that mercy is holy. And neither of the&s;e have any ju&s;t notion of divine mercy or truth. But all that, under a work of the Holy Spirit, have the&s;e united in their hearts, are in a mea&s;ure &s;anctified thro' the truth, have their hearts turned to hate &s;in, and love holine&s;s; to do ju&s;tice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God. Their faith worketh by love to God, and all mankind. They have that charity that hopeth all things, that rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth. And while they love, not only &s;aints, with a pure heart, for the truth's &s;ake that is in them, and all mankind in general, with a tender, ingenuous benevolence, and even their mo&s;t malignant enemies; they cannot endure that which is evil; but hate their work that turn a&s;ide; it &s;hall not cleave to them. Yet, ever tender to other per&s;ons, and are willing to cover a multitude of &s;ins in them, if it may be con&s;i&s;tent with truth and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Thus Jo&s;eph, the reputed father of our Lord, find|ing Mary his e&s;pou&s;ed wife with child, and not know|ing it to be by the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>being a ju&s;t man, was minded to put her away privily,</HI> and not make her a public example, or expo&s;e her to death as an adultre&s;s. His very ju&s;tice, tempered with mercy, engaged him to conceal the private e&s;pou&s;als, that &s;he might &s;uffer no more, than for &s;imple fornication.</P>
<P>Being convinced of their own tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, how they have exceeded: and being melted, with that great mercy, which has forgiven them ten thou&s;and talents, and de|livered their &s;ouls from the lowe&s;t hell; they learn to have compa&s;&s;ion on their fellow &s;ervants, even, as the Lord has had pity on them. And all the per&s;onal wrongs and injuries, they may receive from their fellow creatures, appear to them &s;carce an hundred pence, compared with their wrongs to God; and which they now can readily forgive. Their &s;ins and ingratitude to God, their &s;ins again&s;t heaven and in his &s;ight, appear &s;o great, that the wrongs of men, to them, appear as nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011299_0008_0F869F75F7463908">Thus David could hear, without any con&s;iderable re&s;entment, all the cruel cur&s;ing of an abandoned Shimei. <HI>Behold!</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>my &s;on which came forth of my bowels &s;eeketh my life, and how much more may this Benjamite do it!</HI> Chri&s;t has been broken with my whori&s;h heart, how much more may my heart be broken with the re|proaches of men! <HI>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do. Lay not &s;in to their charge.</HI> The&s;e have truth in their inward parts; and <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are the&s;e merci|ful, for they &s;hall obtain mercy.</HI> They forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and their heavenly father will al&s;o for|give them. That iniquity, which u&s;ed to harden the heart again&s;t God and men, is now in a mea&s;ure purged away, and the&s;e I&s;raelites indeed, in whom is no allowed guile, &s;hall finally be redeemed, with all God's true I&s;rael, from all their iniquities.</P>
<P>By mercy and truth God purges iniquity in his pro|vidential di&s;pen&s;ations towards his people. He purges his floor and refines his people, not only by his word and &s;pirit, but by the mixt di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, calling them to &s;ing of mercy and judgment: vi&s;its in wrath, and in that <HI>wrath remembers mercy; &s;tays his rough wind in the day of his ea&s;twind; and by this &s;hall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away &s;in.</HI> God doth not mete out a cup of naked inexorable ju&s;tice to them, without a mixture of mercy; nor yet of mercy, without truth and ju&s;tice; but &s;ends forth both mercy and truth to pre&s;erve them. Thus in wrath he vi&s;ited I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s; <HI>but being full of compa&s;&s;ion, forgave their iniquity, and de&s;troyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not &s;tir up all his wrath. For he remembered that they were fle&s;h</HI>: He is a God that <HI>forgave them, though he took vengeance on their</HI> &s;inful <HI>inventions.</HI> God an&s;wers the prayers of his people, and gives them what they need; but not without &s;ome <HI>terrible things in righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> to &s;trike an awe upon them. He corrects them, but it is in <HI>judgment,</HI> and a merciful mitigation, <HI>not in his anger,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="011299_0009_0F869F76B754FE48">
&s;o as to <HI>con&s;ume</HI> them. He puts them into the furnace, <HI>melts them and trys them</HI>; but there knows their <HI>&s;ouls in adver&s;ity,</HI> carries them thro' <HI>fire and thro' water, and brings them out into a wealthy place; vi&s;its their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions with a rod, and their iniquity with &s;tripes,</HI> but his <HI>loving-kindne&s;s</HI> he doth <HI>not take from them, nor &s;uffer his faithfulne&s;s to fail.</HI> He cha&s;ti&s;es his people, but not according to their iniquity. But as fathers pity their children under the &s;marting rod of a ju&s;t correction, &s;o the Lord pitieth them that fear him. And after his fatherly rebukes and di&s;cipline, often comforts his peo|ple, as a child whom his mother comforteth, by wiping away the penitent tears, excited by her own tender and faithful correction. So God corrected Solomon, but did not take his <HI>mercy from him, as he took it from Saul.</HI> If his people are, in a ju&s;t &s;everity, put away into a mi|&s;erable captivity in Babylon; yet &s;uch are the Lord's mercies, that they are not con&s;umed; yea, they are vi|&s;ited in mercy, and brought forth out of tho&s;e their graves, and come again to their own land.</P>
<P>The&s;e mixed di&s;pen&s;ations are much for the divine glory, and which are very much the delight of the &s;u|preme ruler. God often conducts in this manner to|wards &s;inners, as well as &s;aints, towards the world, as well as the church.</P>
<P>Thus a &s;inner is cha&s;tened with pain on his bed, and by pining &s;ickne&s;s, brought nigh to the grave; but taught out of God's law, as well as corrected; and the rod and reproof give him wi&s;dom; he is withdrawn from his &s;inful purpo&s;es, and pride hid from him; his ears opened to di&s;cipline, and in&s;truction &s;ealed to him; he is effectually convinced of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of his own wickedne&s;s, accepts the puni&s;hment of his iniquity; then he is gracious unto him, delivers him from going down to the pit of de&s;truction, thro' the divine inven|tion of that ran&s;om provided for our &s;ouls; and in love to his &s;oul delivers him from the grave, and his eyes &s;ee the light. Lo! the&s;e, and &s;uch like things, God works
<PB N="11" REF="011299_0010_0F869F77F163FB60">
oftentimes with man, to bring back his &s;oul from the pit of hell, and his life from the de&s;troyers.</P>
<P>Of all the events of providence, repre&s;ented Zech. 6th chap. by four chariots, coming out from between two mountains of bra&s;s, i. e. from tho&s;e coun&s;els and decrees of heaven, as immovable as mountains of bra&s;s; of all the&s;e none &s;eem &s;o plea&s;ing to God, as tho&s;e in which were mixt coloured hor&s;es, denoting the mixt di&s;pen&s;ations of providence: The&s;e going towards the north country, quieted his &s;pirit (i. e. appea&s;ed his anger) there. They &s;erved to vindicate his name, and maintain the honour of his rectoral righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hew his tender mercies to be over all his works. And were exactly adapted to re|form, and bring to repentance, and &s;o to purge iniquity.</P>
<P>And even to the dark places of the earth, that are full of the habitations of cruelty, God leaves not him&s;elf without witne&s;s of his goodne&s;s, in giving them rain from heaven and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling their hearts with food and gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>We are now to &s;hew, how we are herein to be imi|tators of God, and unite mercy and truth in all our en|deavours for the purging of &s;in. Not by mercy alone without truth, nor by truth alone without mercy; but both by an amiable union. And this we are to ob&s;erve, as heads of families, members of a chri&s;tian church, or of civil &s;ociety. As heads of families, we &s;hould put away iniquity far from our tabernacles; command our children and hou&s;hold after us, to keep the way of the Lord, to do ju&s;tice and judgment. And here, if we would do any thing to purpo&s;e, a parental tenderne&s;s and ju&s;tice mu&s;t be at an even ballance. We mu&s;t not, by an un|merciful kind of haughty &s;everity, provoke our children to wrath; nor yet, by a fal&s;e pity, by a fooli&s;h fondne&s;s, and mi&s;taken tenderne&s;s, &s;pare the rod. The former would di&s;courage them, and break their &s;pirits, and &s;poil their manhood; and the latter be more pernicious to them than hatred it&s;elf; and both the&s;e extremes tend rather to encrea&s;e &s;in, than to purge it. But tenderne&s;s, ju&s;tice,
<PB N="12" REF="011299_0011_0F869F7921A017E0">
love and faithfulne&s;s, &s;weetly tempered, and united; an affectionate tenderne&s;s to their per&s;ons, and a ju&s;t hatred to their &s;ins, will, if any thing, prevail to amend our chil|dren, and keep them from tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es too incident to our thoughtle&s;s, incon&s;iderate youth and children.</P>
<P>As members of a church, we are to unite truth and mercy. The great, important truths of the go&s;pel are not to be given up; but the&s;e truths mu&s;t ever be &s;po|ken in love. A pure go&s;pel, and truth in it's native &s;im|plicity, mu&s;t be firmly and &s;tedfa&s;tly maintained, but with unfeigned tenderne&s;s to the children, and even to the enemies of the truth; but mu&s;t never be given up out of complai&s;ance to any in the world. <HI>Buy the truth and &s;ell it not.</HI> But in the di&s;cipline of the chri&s;tian churches, truth or ju&s;tice mu&s;t not be &s;trained to the wrong of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, but in a godly di&s;cipline, mercy mu&s;t temper our judgments re&s;pecting the mi&s;carriages of others. And many le&s;&s;er failings may be pa&s;&s;ed over with a <HI>"peradventure it was an over&s;ight."</HI> And all proper allowance is to be made for the natural infirmities of others: And we that are &s;trong mu&s;t, with a generous compa&s;&s;ion, bear the infirmities of the weak, and not plea&s;e a &s;elf-&s;ufficient temper in our&s;elves.

<P>Eli's mercy had no truth or ju&s;tice in it, except in too gentle and cold rea&s;onings; while he honoured his &s;ons above God. The truth or ju&s;tice of Diotrephe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> was intolerably &s;evere, to refu&s;e the brethren recom|mended by an Apo&s;tle, forbidding them that would, and ca&s;ting them out of the church. And why all this mer|cile&s;s &s;everity, but the petty differences betwixt the jew|i&s;h and the gentile chri&s;tians? The old &s;aying is hereby verified; extreme right is extreme wrong. But all that &s;et truth and purity before peace, and judiciou&s;ly unite them, take the direct way to church purity. For God him&s;elf purges away the filth of the daughter of Zion, and blood of Jeru&s;alem, by the &s;pirit of judgment, and by the &s;pirit of burning.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o, in civil &s;ociety, all that would do any thing to purpo&s;e for purging the iniquity of a nation or land, mu&s;t be &s;ure to proceed with truth, mercy and ju&s;tice. It is a &s;ad time, indeed, when there is no truth nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. Sin will be the reproach and ruin of &s;uch a people. But where the&s;e prevail, righteou&s;ne&s;s will exalt a nation or people.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e our mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice, in their &s;uperabound|ing mercy, &s;hould &s;pare the vile&s;t criminals: No evil would be put away, and they would bear the &s;word in vain. Vice would be daring, and the wicked walk on all hands; and men would treat the civil mini&s;ters, as they treat their God; and becau&s;e &s;entence again&s;t their evil works, is not &s;peedily executed, their hearts would be fully &s;et in them to do evil. And all the honour of government would be lo&s;t, and in their much mercy pro&s;tituted in favour of wickedne&s;s. Thus Saul, in fooli&s;h pity, &s;pared Agag, contrary to truth, and the ju&s;t

command of God; and by his mi&s;placed tenderne&s;s lo&s;t his kingdom. So David, in the very weakne&s;s of paren|tal mercy, &s;pared Ab&s;alom; who not long after aro&s;e in an unnatural rebellion again&s;t his father, and attempted to jo&s;tle him from the throne, and hunted for his pre|cious life; requiting his lenity, as other fal&s;e favours u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>Thus Ahab &s;pared Benhadad, a man God had ap|pointed to utter de&s;truction; but it is hard to &s;ay, whe|ther in a more infatuated mercy, or ill concerted policy; for his life mu&s;t go, and that of his people for the king and people that he &s;pared. The next war, they will fight only or e&s;pecially with the king of I&s;rael to requite him for his &s;uperlative tenderne&s;s, in &s;aying of Benhadad, "<HI>is he yet alive? he is my brother.</HI>" It would be ea&s;y to prove by dint of common &s;en&s;e, and by the Roman orator, as well as by the holy BIBLE, that &s;uch mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice would be &s;ome of the mo&s;t unmerciful men in the world; cruel to &s;ociety, and even to the criminals, (who would hereby be hardned in &s;in) as well as fal&s;e and treacherous to their God, who&s;e deputies and vice|gerents they are.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, on the other hand, mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice, in a relentle&s;s kind of &s;everity, and ca&s;ting off all pity, &s;hould &s;train every charge to the highe&s;t pitch, and puni&s;h to the utmo&s;t extremity of law; connive at the mo&s;t vex|atious &s;uits, under pretence of zeal again&s;t wrong and inju&s;tice; would not righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;pring up as poi&s;on|ous hemlock in the furrows of the field; and much mi&s;|chief be daily framed by law? Thus mercile&s;s was the truth and ju&s;tice of Saul, in his ra&s;h &s;entence upon his &s;on Jonathan, dooming him to &s;ure death, only for ta&s;t|ing a little honey, while he knew nothing of the prohi|bition; but the people had &s;en&s;e, humanity and mercy enough to re&s;cue from that cruel &s;entence, a man, by whom God had wrought &s;o great a &s;alvation that day. Jehu's truth and ju&s;tice, in executing the hou&s;e of Ahab, were &s;o over&s;trained, that God afterwards vi&s;ited that blood of Jezreel upon the hou&s;e of Jehu.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011299_0014_0F869F7DE26CD9D8">So the hypocritical I&s;raelites executed without mercy the inhabitants of Jabe&s;h-Gilead, becau&s;e they came not to the war again&s;t Benjamin; becau&s;e not God's honour, but their own, was a little touched. And we are &s;orry to find &s;uch a blemi&s;h to the reign of the man after God's own heart, as his putting the children of Ammon under &s;aws and harrows of iron, and making them to pa&s;s through the brick kilns. But it is &s;uppo&s;ed to hap|pen when his heart was hardened in the matter of Uriah.</P>
<P>But let ju&s;tice take place, &s;o far as to &s;uppre&s;s vice, maintain right and equity, and &s;upport the honour of government; but not at the expence of mercy, and even of humanity.

<P>When he that ruleth over men is ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God; in that ingenuous pity that never fails to accompany the fear of the Almighty; the end of civil government is attained, public judgments prevented, our lives and properties &s;ecured, and all our natural and charter rights maintained, and every man may live and rejoice under his own vine and fig-tree, and there be none to make him afraid.</P>

<P>Iniquity connived at, and unpuni&s;hed, will &s;oon bring judgments upon the land.

God him&s;elf will come near to judgment, and be a &s;wift witne&s;s again&s;t adulterers, and again&s;t fal&s;e &s;wearers. We add to the&s;e the profanation of the day of &s;acred re&s;t, the Lord's day, appropriated to his honour; in which to celebrate the wonders of redeeming grace, on this re|&s;urrection day. To profane it by &s;peaking our own words, or doing our own &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s, or finding our own plea&s;ure; or by neglect of the holy &s;olemnities of the day; is to throw contempt on all the works of re|demption, to de&s;pi&s;e all the benefits of the redeemer's purcha&s;e, and to de&s;pi&s;e and de&s;troy our own &s;ouls; no wonder then, that an affronted Saviour &s;o often for this

<P>Becau&s;e we execute not his judgments, nor keep his &s;abbaths, God may e'er long be provoked to give us &s;tatutes (civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical) that are not good, and judgments whereby we cannot live. With what affec|tionate a pathos did the pious governor Nehemiah re|mon&s;trate again&s;t this &s;in? chap. xiii. ver. 17, 18. <HI>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and &s;aid unto them, what evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the &s;ab|bath day? did not your fathers thus? and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon I&s;rael by profaning the &s;abbath.</HI></P>
<P>But thus are we led to what was more e&s;pecially de|&s;igned, in a way of application, and to the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, viz. to improve the awful di&s;pen&s;ation in the week pa&s;t. Iniquity purged, by purging the &s;in|ner out of the world. As we are at the di&s;tance of but eight miles, many of you, my brethren, attended the ex|ecution three days ago: You beheld the bitter effects of &s;in, in a mi&s;creant hung up between heaven and earth, as fit for neither: you heard a &s;olemn and pertinent &s;er|mon on the &s;hocking occa&s;ion: you beheld his dying agonies; and I tru&s;t the eye affected the heart. The like has not been done in this county for more than twenty years.</P>
<P>Perhaps there never was an execution like to this, wherein mercy and truth, or mercy and ju&s;tice, were bet|ter united. A whole year pa&s;&s;ed after he was found guilty, before his &s;entence.

His darling lu&s;ts were idlene&s;s, drunkenne&s;s, uncleanne&s;s, and lying and &s;tealing, with a mo&s;t profane contempt of the name and day of God, and all &s;acred things.

And O &s;hocking &s;tupidity! could laugh at hell and dam|nation, even while he did not profe&s;&s;edly deny their reality. He was led captive by the Devil at his will. For &s;even years, e&s;pecially, he &s;erved him with all his power, and often wearied him&s;elf to commit iniquity.

I&s;rael could &s;ee all the terrors of Mount Sinai, and Lot's two daugh|ters behold, and narrowly e&s;cape the flames of Sodom, yet remain as they were. The impenitent thief (or both while impenitent) could rail at the Lord of glory on the cro&s;s. It is the peculiar work of the almighty Spirit, to take the &s;tony heart out of out fle&s;h, and give us hearts of fle&s;h. Condemned criminals will go no further in their repentance than legal &s;orrow for &s;in, becau&s;e they mu&s;t &s;uffer for it; unle&s;s the divine Spirit work in them that repentance which is unto &s;alvation. At the la&s;t, he had an hope that &s;upported him again&s;t the terrors of a &s;hocking death, or was, to a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;tu|pid and in&s;en&s;ible of his danger. He &s;aid, when going to the place of execution, that he was willing to die; and ju&s;t before he was turned off, being a&s;ked by the officer, if he had any thing to &s;ay, an&s;wered with a low voice, "No; but that I would that poor creatures be warned that they come not to my doleful end." If he found mercy with the Lord, in that day, he will prai&s;e and magnify his name forevermore, for his great mercy to|wards him, in delivering his &s;oul from the lowe&s;t hell;
<PB N="24" REF="011299_0023_0F869F884B7AB0B0">
and in timely &s;oftening his heart by omnipotent grace, as that of the penitent thief on the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>REMARK VI. All who&s;e hearts are fully &s;et in them to do the&s;e, or like evils, and will not be reclaimed, are in the high road to de&s;truction, if not by the way of the gallows. When any are &s;o joined to idols, as that they mu&s;t needs be let alone, to &s;in without controul; and the mo&s;t gentle means, or ju&s;t &s;everities, are in vain, their ca&s;e is very &s;ad, if not de&s;perate. <HI>Let favour be &s;hewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, in the land of uprightne&s;s</HI> (or religion) <HI>he will deal unju&s;tly, and will not behold the maje&s;ty of the Lord: Why &s;hould</HI> he <HI>be &s;tricken any more? he will revolt more and more.</HI> He that hateth and de&s;pi&s;eth reproof &s;hall die. <HI>Correct thy &s;on, and</HI> it may be expected that <HI>he will give thee re&s;t</HI>; but if, out of a fooli&s;h fondne&s;s, you indulge him in wickedne&s;s, he will give you trouble enough: But the be&s;t in&s;tructions, and mo&s;t tender cor|rections, will not reclaim them that, like this now ruined youth, have their hearts fully &s;et in them to do evil. So we mu&s;t leave them to take their cour&s;e, and chu&s;e the road to death. If they are wi&s;e, they are wi&s;e for them&s;elves; if they are &s;corners, they alone mu&s;t bear it.</P>
<P>REMARK VII. If any young people are re&s;olved upon their own ruin, the way is open and broad, and ea&s;y to find&mdash;it is, in a word, to walk in pride, in the way of their own heart, and in the &s;ight of their own eyes; re|jecting all the coun&s;els of God, of pa&s;tors, or parents, again&s;t them&s;elves. Let the eye that loves death mock at his father and de&s;pi&s;e to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley &s;hall pick it out, the young eagles &s;hall eat it. Let them pull away the &s;houlder, and refu&s;e to hear the words which the Lord of ho&s;ts &s;ends to them by the former prophets, by Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles. Let them profane the name and day of God. Let their life be with the drunkard and the unclean. Never go to the
<PB N="25" REF="011299_0024_0F869F88B677B9C0">
wi&s;e, but be the companions of fools, and go in company with the workers of iniquity, who are to be de&s;troyed. Follow wicked coun&s;els to practice iniquity; ca&s;t off fear and re&s;train prayer before God. Say <HI>what is the Al|mighty that we &s;hould &s;erve him, and what profit &s;hall we have if we pray unto him?</HI> Let them, with a &s;tiff|necked re&s;olution, pur&s;ue their own ways, and delight in their own abominations. Very &s;oon will their iniqui|ties be full, or they will trea&s;ure up the more <HI>wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and the revelation of his righteous judgment.</HI></P>
<P>REMARK VIII. The &s;ame Devil that tempts to &s;in, and helps to palliate it, and flatters with impunity, will abandon, or rather betray them at la&s;t. Sin and Satan may for a while &s;creen from ju&s;tice. Tho&s;e words of the wi&s;e man, <HI>neither &s;hall wickedne&s;s deliver them that are given to it,</HI> intimate, that it may &s;eem to deliver, or one wickedne&s;s &s;erve to cloak and cover another, but will not long avail. But tho' a &s;inner do evil an hun|dred times, and his days be prolonged, yet it &s;hall not long be well with the wicked, nor &s;hall he prolong his days which are as a &s;hadow. After all the &s;trange e&s;|capes of this&mdash;&s;o arch in wickedne&s;s, it appears by his conduct after his life was forfeited, that the Devil is no more to be tru&s;ted as a protector, than as a tempter. He not only returned home, after his atrocious vil|lainy, (tho' &s;o well practi&s;ed in running away) but after he was arre&s;ted by the officer and gave him the &s;lip, with a good hor&s;e, &s;illily for him&s;elf, went home and &s;o was re-taken. And when he broke pri&s;on, was no &s;ooner abandoned by his companions, but he went to a public hou&s;e, where he had been acquainted, and &s;o was re-taken, and &s;ent back to pri&s;on. So he was at la&s;t infatuated, to meet his de&s;erved end. This we view as the holy hand of God, leaving him to be at la&s;t in&s;nared in the work of his own hands; and as the hand of Satan de&s;erting him, whom he had &s;o often
<PB N="26" REF="011299_0025_0F869F897B48A2C0">
furni&s;hed with a corrupt will in wickedne&s;s, that he might the &s;ooner incur that ruin, to which the prince of this world had decoyed him. Thus remarkable is the hand of God in the infatuation of Pharaoh, and his &s;ervants; that he might make inqui&s;ition for blood, and take vengeance for the murder of the male children of I&s;rael. Mo&s;es is ordered to turn towards the red &s;ea, and encamp be&s;ide Pihahiroth; where the unarmed ho&s;ts of I&s;rael mu&s;t be hemmed in on all &s;ides. Pharaoh now concludes that the wilderne&s;s had &s;hut them in. They mu&s;t fall an ea&s;y prey. He pur&s;ues them as &s;ure of victory; yea &s;o infatuated, as to pur&s;ue them into the red &s;ea, which turned and covered them; and &s;o the innocent blood of the male children was avenged. When Haman's face was covered, or that of any con|demned criminal, we know what is next.</P>
<P>REMARK IX. We may di&s;cover the cau&s;e that &s;o many of the natives peri&s;h from under go&s;pel light. Contempt of the means of grace, &s;lighting the offers and opportunities vouch&s;afed to them, neglect of the great &s;alvation, 'till God ju&s;tly leaves them, and the grand adver&s;ary en&s;nares them, to drunkenne&s;s and unclean|ne&s;s, and &s;o to become in&s;en&s;ible to all the in&s;tructions of wi&s;dom. A late writer has ob&s;erved, that "New-Eng|land rum has ruined more Indians than the go&s;pel has &s;aved of them." Wherever this debauchee came among them, they were his coun&s;ellors to work wickedne&s;s; and by drunkenne&s;s and uncleanne&s;s, with them, &s;oon lo&s;t all the little remains of the natural &s;en&s;e of moral virtue. They had better have been brought up in the wilds of Africa, or in the remote&s;t corners of the world, than thus to hear the joyful &s;ound of the go&s;pel &s;alvation, and re|ceive this grace of God in vain; after all failing <HI>of the grace of God.</HI></P>
<P>REMARK X. If any are willing to be cautioned and warned, they have now an opportunity afforded them by heaven; a Lot's wife de&s;igned for a warning to all
<PB N="27" REF="011299_0026_0F869F8C56BD1350">
that live ungodly. Remember poor Arthur! and thus admoni&s;hed learn righteou&s;ne&s;s. and not to de&s;pi&s;e the Saviour of the world.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;cite ju&s;titiam, monit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; et non temnere <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> See &s;in in its di&s;mal con&s;equences, at la&s;t it biteth like a &s;erpent, and &s;tingeth like an adder.

Con&s;ider his &s;in and infamous ruin, and &s;hun tho&s;e abominable vices that brought him to his &s;hocking death. He is de&s;igned by heaven for a monument to warn us, and that all the natives, negroes, and all people, <HI>may hear and fear, and do no more &s;o wickedly.</HI></P>
<P>What is all the &s;hame and infamy, pain and trouble of a public trial and execution, compared with the everla&s;t|ing &s;hame and contempt, mourning and wo in the great day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men? Their griefs &s;hall be multiplied that ha&s;ten after a &s;trange God, or &s;trange lu&s;ts. <HI>Judgments are prepared for &s;cor|ners and &s;tripes for the back of fools. They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</HI> Here we &s;ee &s;in, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as it is, and di&s;cern the hook without the bait. <HI>'Till I went unto the &s;anctuary, then &s;aw I their end.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Good God! on what a &s;lippery &s;teep,</L>
<L>The thoughtle&s;s wretches go!&mdash;</L>
<L>And oh! that dreadful fiery lake,</L>
<L>That waits their fall below!</L></Q>
<P>REMARK XI. If any are wicked coun&s;ellors to chil|dren or &s;ervants, as the hou&s;e of Ahab to Ahaziah,&mdash; his coun&s;ellors to work wickedne&s;s; here is a voice from heaven to them, in this awful providence. A voice as loud as thunder, to awaken them to con&s;ider their ways.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t the wicked advi&s;ers of poor Arthur one day feel in their racked con&s;ciences? What their meeting in the other world? Children that are corruptors, par|takers of other mens &s;ins, plotters of mi&s;chief, mu&s;t one day give an account of all the wickedne&s;s committed
<PB N="28" REF="011299_0027_0F869F8D89769B80">
by their advice, or &s;inful connivance. One &s;uch &s;inner de&s;troys much good. They are the Devil's agents to de&s;troy &s;ouls, and bodies too, as in the late in&s;tance. They hunt for the precious life. O that all our young people were &s;o wi&s;e, as when &s;inners entice them, not to con&s;ent, but con&s;ider them as enemies; yea as incarnate Devils, engaged on Satan's &s;ide, doing his work, and to receive his wages. They that en&s;nare others to go with them to the pit of mi&s;ery, will find it le&s;s tolerable than to have gone there alone.</P>
<P>REMARK XII. That to &s;in again&s;t, and after &s;uch a &s;olemn alarm from heaven, is to &s;in at a dear rate. Wo to them that are not hereby admoni&s;hed, &s;o, as to &s;hun tho&s;e dangerous precipices, where one has &s;o lately fallen headlong to ruin. They that live in the like &s;ins, are in the &s;ame way, though they may not have proceeded &s;o far. The way of &s;in is down-hill. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nemo repente fit turpi&s;&s;imus.</NOTE> No man is entirely abandoned to wickedne&s;s all at once. Sad and awful indeed if the drunkard will &s;till wallow in his vomit, if the unclean will not repent of the fornication which they have committed, but proceed from evil to evil, and add &s;in to &s;in, running greedily after the errors of this profligate, notwith&s;tanding his bitter end; if the thieves will yet watch for their neighbours goods. <HI>Let him that &s;tole &s;teal no more.</HI> Sad indeed, if lyars &s;till meditate deceit, and utter from the heart words of fal&s;hood. Or any, by idlene&s;s and for&s;aking their lawful bu&s;ine&s;s, yet tempt the Devil to tempt them to the mo&s;t impudent vices. Such are apace filling up their mea&s;ure of &s;in, and this awful in&s;tance may be brought into judgment again&s;t them. And how awful to hear from the throne&punc; that is as the fiery flame, as Prov. i.24, 25, and on. <HI>But becau&s;e I have called and ye refu&s;ed; I have &s;tretched out my hand and no man regarded. But ye have &s;et at nought all my coun&s;els, and would none of my reproof,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="011299_0028_0F869F8E934D40F0">REMARK XIII. Here is a voice of God to heads of families, parents and ma&s;ters, to in&s;truct tho&s;e under their care; to guide them with their eye, and endeavour early to in&s;til into them the principles of virtue, and to furni&s;h the young men with knowledge and di&s;cretion, and ex|hort the ri&s;ing generation to be &s;ober-minded, and to <HI>have no fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful works of darkne&s;s, but rather to reprove them.</HI> How pathetical is that of Bath&s;heba to Solomon? <HI>What my &s;on? What the &s;on of my womb? and what the &s;on of my vows? Give not thy &s;trength unto women, nor thy ways to that which de|&s;troyeth kings.</HI></P>
<P>FINALLY, Let us all unite mercy and truth, in all our moral and religious conduct; in whatever &s;tation and relation; in families, in churches, and in all our civil affairs. Be thankful for the civil government, that ju&s;tice is admini&s;tred, and the oppre&s;&s;ed vindicated from wrongs and violence, and iniquity obliged to &s;top her mouth. If any do evil, let them be afraid of the power of the civil magi&s;trate; for he beareth not the &s;word in vain, as we &s;aw in the week pa&s;t. But who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? Civil rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Let us be thankful for that re&s;training grace, that has kept us from &s;uch notorious exce&s;&s;es. Beg daily for grace to keep you from the foule&s;t vices, and take heed that no one of you <HI>&s;uffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a bu&s;y-body in other mens matters. Let your loins be girt with truth;</HI> and be ever merciful to all, &s;hun the dangerous paths of the de&s;troyer, <HI>follow after righteou&s;ne&s;s, godline&s;s, faith, cha|rity, and peace, with them that call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart.</HI> So will the Lord pre&s;erve you, and keep you from evil, and <HI>deliver you from every evil work, and pre&s;erve you &s;afe unto his heavenly king|dom, to him be glory forever, Amen.</HI></P>
