<P>THE poi&s;ons which have lately been too lavi&s;hly &s;cat|tered among you, call aloud for an antidote; and by their operations they appear to be of &s;o deadly a kind, as to require the immediate counteration of &s;ome powerfully efficient recipe; till &s;uch an one is produced, a le&s;s forcible pre&s;cription may, by &s;topping their progre&s;s, be found &s;alutary.</P>
<P>Of late two pamphlets have appeared, the authors of which, the contending parties of this country, &s;eem to con&s;ider as the invulnerable champions of their different principles and in|tere&s;ts; and each has therefore naturally attracted the atten|tion of its friends and oppo&s;ers; but the zeal of the whigs, in di&s;per&s;ing abroad their boa&s;ted and favourite production, has far out-&s;tripped that of the tories, who, perhaps, not con&s;ider|ing an appeal to the head, as &s;o adapted to the purpo&s;es of party, as one to the heart, have not in&s;erted the Friendly Ad|dre&s;s in a News-Paper;&mdash;have not con&s;iderably reduced its price; or &s;ent it abroad gratis, as a &s;timilus to their friends<NOTE N="Daggar" PLACE="foot">It is ob&s;ervable in the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, de&s;igned for general u&s;e, it has been thought advi&s;eable to omit one of the be&s;t turned, and be&s;t de&s;erved compli|ments to an officer of high rank, that, in the compa&s;s of a &s;mall reading, I as yet remember to have &s;een:&mdash;Such in&s;idious arts, and &s;uch want of candot are inexcu&s;eable, and would di&s;grace the noble&s;t of cau&s;es.</NOTE>:</P>

The&s;e being the honours which party has conferred on the &s;trictures on that performance, it may not be unamu&s;ing or un|profitable to examine on what foundation this boa&s;ted bul|wark of faction is erected. This writer, like a true di&s;ciple of the noble author of the Characteri&s;tics, tries every thing by the touch&s;tone of ridicule; but does he know that it can place all &s;ubjects, even the &s;acred precepts and my&s;teries of our ho|ly religion, in the &s;ame point of view; and like the jaundiced eye, &s;eeing through a tainted medium, reduce all objects, however varied in colours, to its own loath&s;ome hue? He commences with a notable di&s;covery from unerring &s;igns, of his antagoni&s;t's profe&s;&s;ion; but I much query if any one, from his &s;ub&s;equent ob&s;ervations, would be induced to con&s;ider him a &s;oldier</P>
<P>The friends of Briti&s;h government in America are, I tru&s;t, not &s;o contemptible as the picture of this &s;tricturer would lu|dicrou&s;ly di&s;play them; many have already declared their attachment to its cau&s;e, and fifty times their numbers, at pre|&s;ent overwhelmed by popular fury, would in the day of trial avow it: I wi&s;h not to &s;ee <HI>royal &s;tandards erected, or &s;words flaming in the front, and in the rear,</HI> but alas! the melancholy face of affairs on this continent too &s;trongly indicates it; and then, I am convinced, the regular troops would not, on ex|perience, be found &s;o contemptible as he endeavours to repre|&s;ent them; or that colony forces could be &s;o ea&s;ily rai&s;ed and di&s;ciplined, as he a&s;&s;erts: A <HI>&s;implification</HI> of manoeuvres that can be learnt in <HI>three months,</HI> will not bring you, Americans, to that &s;teadine&s;s, that you &s;hall, with regularity and compo|&s;ure, like the Engli&s;h troops at Fontenoy, evolute in the face of a victorious and &s;uperior army: For my part, I will go further than even this rapid in&s;tructor, and engage to teach &s;chool-boys, with wooden guns on their &s;houlders, <HI>to form and reduce from a line of fire to a line of impre&s;&s;ion,</HI> in half an hour; but to train men for war, requires labour, experience, and time; and to reduce them to perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to every &s;uperior, is with difficulty effected in legal e&s;tabli&s;hments, never in popu|lar and tumultuous a&s;&s;ociations; deprived of that coer&s;ive pow|er, which, in the former produces obedience, their leaders in vain &s;eek by attentions and courte&s;ies that compliance with their commands, which the others derive from e&s;tabli&s;hed un|di&s;puted authority.</P>

the fatigues, dangers and wants of long campaigns; they would &s;oon mi&s;s tho&s;e &s;olaces which dome&s;tic tranquility afford|ed them, and would revert to their pri&s;tine avocations and de|lights; their acquaintance with the u&s;e of implements of hu&s;|bandry would &s;tand them in but little &s;tead, for to what pur|po&s;e &s;hould they employ them? It has long been acknowledg|ed a principle in war, that irregulars are not calculated for defence, but attack; their vigour and intrepidity may bear down all ob&s;tacles to the latter, but too &s;urely they will fail in that patience and per&s;everance which is indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite for the former, When the New-England provincials, under General Pepperrell, in the year forty five, attacked Louis|bourg, they laughed at the regular methods of approach pro|po&s;ed to them, and by a concurrence of fortunate circum&s;tances, united to valour, carried that important fortre&s;s; this is a fact which many of them can vouch, and mo&s;t, if not all the re&s;t of them have heard repeatedly from their fathers, when recounting the atchievements of their youthful days; and they mu&s;t then have al&s;o told them, that the petulance of their brave countrymen was more than once on the point of giving up that glorious enterprize.&mdash;Con&s;ider therefore, I adjure you, by tho&s;e ties and relations which endear life, and &s;trow flowers along the rugged path of its pilgrimage; con&s;ider, before you engage in an attempt of &s;o &s;erious, &s;o hazardous a nature, as the oppo&s;ing a royal and long con&s;tituted army, what may rea&s;onably be expected from forces &s;o liable to defections as the unre&s;trained and ha&s;tily levied troops of the&s;e colonies mu&s;t ever be: Your numbers are al&s;o held forth to you as powerful and unconquerable, and I do not deny that on &s;o extended a continent as this, many armies of forty-thou&s;and each might, in the various operations of a war, to advantage be employed; but &s;uppo&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible for this even to be the ca&s;e, what mu&s;t be its unavoidable con&s;equences? All your pea&s;antry being engaged in martial expeditions, the land would want its culture, and a dearth in a very few months mu&s;t infallibly en&s;ue, which would deprive your &s;oldiers of even nece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;tenance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To &s;trengthen this ob&s;ervation, Germany la&s;t war afforded melancholy proofs to what di&s;tre&s;s a country is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, when occupied by contending armies.</NOTE>, for they mu&s;t forego at the commencement every idea and wi&s;h for their accu&s;tomed luxuries: Are you yet to be told that there are di&s;ea&s;es which are endemic to a camp, and that when famine with "baneful &s;mile" &s;talks through

its avenues, &s;he will add fre&s;h poignancy and malignity to its in&s;eparable di&s;orders? From mo&s;t of the&s;e evils your opponents will be free; from long practice their con&s;titutions are habi|tuated to the fatigues of the mo&s;t rigid di&s;cipline, they may feel di&s;temper, but they are better enabled to repel it than you, unu&s;ed to hard&s;hips, can po&s;&s;ibly be; nor will they be haunted by the &s;malle&s;t dread of want; your ports blocked up by the navy of England, though denying you relief, will afford them plentiful &s;upplies, and in ca&s;e of defeat, a mo&s;t &s;ure retreat, till augmented by numerous and powerful reinforcements; for remember, that Great-Britain, during la&s;t war, did at one time carry conque&s;t through every quarter of the globe, and that you a&s;&s;i&s;ted her only in this.</P>
<P>Hitherto, Americans, I have only pointed out to you the in&s;tability of your own force; it behoves you as you have examined how far you can rely with &s;afety on it, to change the &s;cene, and &s;ee how it &s;tands oppo&s;ed to that of your anta|goni&s;ts, and here the pro&s;pect is different; taught to conquer by di&s;cipline, they firmly confide in what they know is irre|&s;i&s;table; and not di&s;tracted by jarring principles and move|ments: with them every part of the machine acts in harmony and concord, and every &s;pring, and every wheel con&s;pires to produce its nece&s;&s;ary efficient force.</P>
<P>It matters not of what per&s;ons armies are compo&s;ed, &s;ince the profe&s;&s;ion has a natural tendency to create in them new principles and ideas of fortitude, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and reliance on the wi&s;dom and experience of their &s;uperiors: Your informant has told you the Briti&s;h troops are made up of "<HI>the mo&s;t de|bauched weavers' prentices, the &s;cum of the Iri&s;h Roman Catholics, who de&s;ert upon every occa&s;ion, and a few, very few, Scotch, who are not &s;trong enough to carry packs.</HI>" I have cultivated an acquaintance with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the military gentlemen, and have found them men of candour and worth; from their information, and my own ob&s;ervation, I will now in the&s;e particulars lay before you a true and impartial &s;tate of the Briti&s;h army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer of the Strictures in &s;tating the number of the Briti&s;h infan|try, has, either through negligence or purpo&s;ely committed an error, by not including the marines: Their e&s;tabli&s;hment is, I think, upwards of four thou&s;and. This corps, though exi&s;ting under a different act of Parliament, may properly be denominated an addition to the marching regiments, as in the expeditions of la&s;t war it frequently co-operated with them, and by its vigour and intrepidity contributed to their memorable &s;ucce&s;&s;es. This is only produced as an in&s;tance of what occurs in every page, unfair rea&s;oning from mi&s;repre&s;ented facts; for a trifling peace e&s;tabli&s;hment is not to be computed the force of Britain,&mdash;it is founded on a plan, recommended by Mar&s;hal Saxe for the French army, of having many battalions with more officers to each that requi&s;ite for the number of private men, that in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, new levies might be ingrafted on them, and by that means a con&s;iderable body of troops, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for actual &s;ervice, be almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly completed; and then, I feel a&s;&s;ured, that an <HI>exhau&s;ted nation,</HI> from her <HI>refu&s;e,</HI> could &s;end forth numbers, that world prove formidable, even to her mo&s;t powerful enemies.</NOTE>: If that part which England affords is only <HI>the

mo&s;t debauched weavers 'prentices,</HI> whence ari&s;es the great inte|re&s;t which the friends of many of them have with the country gentlemen, and which is often powerfully employed in &s;olicit|ing their di&s;charges? And by what arts have &s;o many appren|tices, without detection, de&s;erted their ma&s;ters, and broke their indentures? But all recruiting officers, and I &s;u&s;pect the Stricturer can affirm it, know that it is the country and not the towns which completes their battalions, that they beat up only on market-days when pea&s;ants, not mechanics re&s;ort to them; and you can all of you judge from the appearance of tho&s;e recruits which have been brought hither, if they were the produce of villages or cities. <HI>The &s;cum of the Iri&s;h Roman Catholics,</HI> he tells you, forms the proportion from that country, but unfortunately two &s;trong circum&s;tances militate again&s;t this a&s;&s;ertion, for the legi&s;lature of Ireland, from fatal ex|perience, jealous of the Roman Catholics, has, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, prohibited them the u&s;e of arms, and di&s;|qualified them from forming a part of the defence of their country: Yet I am told that &s;ome few, notwith&s;tanding, are &s;muggled into the &s;ervice, but this can only be in tho&s;e regi|ments lately on that e&s;tabli&s;hment, and in them very incon|&s;iderable; the other circum&s;tance is a law, which, from the fear of depopulation, pro&s;cribes the enli&s;ting any man for other than the e&s;tabli&s;hment within that kingdom: His annexment that they <HI>de&s;ert upon every occa&s;ion,</HI> is not better grounded upon fact;&mdash;here the mention of de&s;ertion, makes me wi&s;h to advert to this great &s;ource of triumph in your popular leaders; they proclaim to the world how numerous have the in&s;tances of it been from the army quartered in Bo&s;ton, and yet, I am well informed, it is no more than has always been from a &s;imilar body of troops, even to the natural enemies of their country; and I heartily wi&s;h they could as ea&s;ily reconcile to their con|&s;ciences the &s;educing men from their allegiance and duty to the wor&s;t of crimes, perjury, and the greate&s;t of earthly evils, un|prepared, and almo&s;t certain, death if retaken: Our author makes up the &s;mall re&s;idue with <HI>a few, very few, Scoth, who are not &s;trong enough to carry packs:</HI> I am told, had he been at

the trouble to examine mu&s;ter rolls he would have found them not &s;o incon&s;iderable; that this is propable we may rea&s;onably conclude from the number of emigrants who have quitted that country to come here, and what their condition is, tho&s;e who have &s;een them, will judge: In fine, what is actually the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the whole Briti&s;h army, one who has not &s;een all of it cannot with preci&s;ion determine, but if I might judge from tho&s;e regiments, which, in their tour of duty, have been &s;ent here, I &s;hould pronounce it more than ver&s;ed <HI>in the tricks of the parade.</HI> I &s;hould pronounce it highly trained and qua|lified for &s;ervice; but it is objected that <HI>few of them have &s;een action,</HI> and therefore they are much to be <HI>doubted:</HI> Who can have told this author &s;o? For mo&s;t &s;urely he has been &s;trangely mi&s;informed; of the little army &s;tationed in this capital there are two of the Quebec, and one of the Minden battalions, in which many of the officers and &s;oldiers who conquered on tho&s;e glorious days, &s;till remain, and in mo&s;t of the other regiments, which compo&s;e it, many of the veterans of la&s;t war to be found: and for my own part, when I view this &s;mall, but finely appointed army, and con&s;ider that it is under the com|mand of two Generals of approved knowledge and experience in war, I feel much confidence in the difficulties it would be able to &s;urmount, and the victories over irregulars, which, in human probability, it would a&s;&s;uredly obtain.</P>
<P>In order to induce in you a belief of his military principles and knowledge, he produces an in&s;tance in proof from the con&s;titution of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's army, but even was it, which I have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to doubt, literally as he has &s;tated, it cannot then, I apprehend, be brought as a precedent in this ca&s;e, for there is no &s;imilarity between the connected and ab&s;olute power of that monarch over all his dominions, and the di&s;tinct and widely &s;eparated colonies of North-Ame|rica: Between &s;upporting the authority of the lawful Sovereign, and rebelling again&s;t him.</P>
<P>He tells you al&s;o, that <HI>no inferences can be drawn</HI> from the conque&s;t of Quebec, by the army under General Wolfe, but believe me, he is much mi&s;taken, for la&s;t war will afford abund|ant proofs to the contrary: Was it the <HI>conquering attributes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"<HI>Would have made him, Wolfe, reject with horror the</HI> HANGMAN's OFFICE, <HI>which others, who are not endowed with his conquering attributes, will with readine&s;s accept.</HI>" When men of genius and education, in defiance of facts, de&s;cend from the delicacy of language ot the &s;currility of the lower or|ders, human nature &s;tants appalled, and &s;orrowing, laments the mi&s;application of knowledge and talents;&mdash;but di&s;appointed ambition, and its con&s;equent&punc; di&s;affection will, with the benevolent, plead &s;ome mitigation, even though the &s;haft is aimed at a character, which was once de&s;ervedly the &s;ubject of his highe&s;t admiration and prai&s;e.</NOTE>

<P>After having, with many arguments, and more humours taught you to de&s;pi&s;e the armies of Britain, he proceeds, and attempts with the &s;ame weapons to convince you of &s;ecurity from inva&s;ion by foreigners, and tells you of a convention of the empire in the year 1764; but, <HI>does he not know,</HI> that the re&s;olves of that body have ever been held in deri&s;ion by its members, from the time that the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e and Prince Maurice of Saxony, laughed at the decrees of the Aulic Council, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, more powerful than any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, till his Maje&s;ty of Pru&s;&s;ia and the Elector of Hanover, &s;tood unmoved, and &s;u&s;tained the thunders of the imperial ban?

<OPENER><SALUTE>TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A PAMPHLET, entitled <HI>A Friendly Addre&s;s to all rea|&s;onable Americans,</HI> adverti&s;ed and &s;old by Mr. James Rivington, of New-York, is of &s;o extraordinary a nature that it is difficult for any Man, who is intere&s;ted in the welfare of the Community (whatever contempt he may have for the performance) to remain &s;ilent. I know not whe|ther the author is a Layman or Eccle&s;ia&s;tick, but he bears &s;trongly the characters of the latter. He has the want of can|dour and truth, the apparent &s;pirit of per&s;ecution, the unfor|givingne&s;s, the deadly hatred to Di&s;&s;enters, and the zeal for arbitrary power, which has di&s;tingui&s;hed Churchmen in all ages, and more particularly the <HI>high</HI> part of the Church of England; I cannot help therefore con&s;idering him as one of this order.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of his Pamphlet is manife&s;tly to di&s;&s;olve the &s;pi|rit of union, and check the noble ardor prevailing through the continent; but his zeal &s;o far out-runs his abilities, that there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to think that his Reverence has laboured to little effect. His di&s;cretion &s;eems to be &s;till le&s;s than his genius. A man of common judgment would not &s;o wantonly have attacked the general reigning principles and opinions of a People, whom he intends to &s;educe or intimi|date out of their rights and privileges: For in&s;tance, I be|lieve there are at lea&s;t ninety-nine Americans in an hundred, who think that Charles the Fir&s;t was an execrable tyrant, that he met with no harder fate than he de&s;erved, and that his two Sons ought in ju&s;tice to have made the &s;ame exit. To de&s;cant therefore on the criminality of the re&s;i&s;tance made to that ty|rant; to affect on every occa&s;ion giving the title of rebellion

to the civil war which brought him to ju&s;tice, is a degree of weakne&s;s which no man who is not blinded by the daemon of jacobiti&s;m could po&s;&s;ibly be guilty of. But to preach up in this enlightend age (as he does in almo&s;t expre&s;s terms) pa&s;&s;ive obedience, is a mark of lunacy, or at lea&s;t it proves that the moment a head begins to itch for a mitre, it lo&s;es the faculty of rea&s;oning, for if the principle of pa&s;&s;ive obedience is admit|ted, the gracious Prince, for whom his Reverence profe&s;&s;es &s;o great a devotion is a downright u&s;urper, and the Parliament of which he &s;peaks &s;o re&s;pectfully, Lords and Commons, are rebels and traitors.</P>
<P>The doctrines he aims to inculcate are as follow&mdash;<HI>That the Parliament has a right to tax you without your con&s;ent; that the duty upon tea is no tax; that this duty is your only grievance; that the cau&s;e of Bo&s;ton is their own concern; that it is not your cau&s;e; that the puni&s;hment of Bo&s;ton is a ju&s;t puni&s;hment; that it is lenient; that it is not equal to their crimes; that the Bo&s;toni|ans are rebels, traitors, and pampered fanatics; that the Con|gre&s;s are little better; that no mi&s;conduct of admini&s;tration can ju&s;tify or excu&s;e open di&s;re&s;pect; that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is to be paid to the higher powers, whatever character they be; that an Apo&s;tle enjoined &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the tyrant Nero; that of all people under heaven, the King's American &s;ubjects have the lea&s;t cau&s;e for complaint; that the pre&s;ent confu&s;ion of the Colonies has been occa&s;ioned by fal&s;e alarms; that none of your legal rights have been invaded; no in|jury has been done you, and con&s;equently that you can never be ju&s;|tified in re&s;enting that of which you have no rea&s;on to complain; that you are no judges of the rights of Parliament; that the Par|liament ought to act according to their own judgment, not accord|ing to yours, even in things which concern you principally or &s;oley: that they a&s;&s;ert they have the right in que&s;tion; that you have ne|ver proved they have not; that you have always believed or al|lowed they have it until the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; that the Quebec Bill is a ju&s;t and con&s;titutional Bill; that the Canadians are likely to prove the be&s;t and mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects in his Maje&s;ty's American do|minions; that there is too much rea&s;on to believe that the minds of the Americans are unprincipled, and their hearts di&s;po&s;ed for re|bellion; that &s;ince the reduction of Canada they have been bloated with a vain opinion of their own power and importance; that the I&s;land of Great-Britain is able to govern</HI> (that is to dragoon) <HI>ten Americas; that the moment it is known that America is no longer under the protection of Great-Britain, all the maritime pow|ers of Europe would join to ravage your &s;ea ports, plander and &s;eize

your &s;hips merely for the plea&s;ure of ravaging;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is perhaps the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous idea that ever was hatched in a di&s;tempered brain. America (more particularly &s;ince the di&s;tractions in Po|land have taken place) has been the great granary or <HI>cella penaria</HI> of Europe. Is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive that the different maritime powers &s;hould unite to deprive them&s;elves of the chief means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, merely for the fun's &s;ake? Is it not more natural to &s;uppo&s;e that they would out-bid each other, for your friend&s;hip and commerce on which &s;o much depends? When the Low Countries withdrew them&s;elves from the dominion of Spain, did Eng|land, France, and the other Powers immediately &s;et about ravaging their &s;ea ports and &s;eizing their &s;hips? Did they not, on the contrary, exert them|&s;elves directly and indirectly to a&s;&s;i&s;t them? The ca&s;e is &s;imilar, the event would be &s;imilar; and that Great-Britain would not be powerful enough at &s;ea, when &s;eparated from her Colonies; to prevent this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall refer my readers to Ma&s;&s;ie's E&s;timates, the authority of which has never been di&s;|puted, and which demon&s;trate, that more than half the naval power of Great-Britain &s;tands on her American foundation.</NOTE> <HI>that all the ma|ritime powers of the world would not di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Great-Britain of the empire of the &s;ea even when America is &s;eparated from her.</HI>&mdash;Now I challenge the world to produce &s;o many wicked &s;enti|ments, &s;tupid principles, audaciou&s;ly fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, and mon|&s;trous ab&s;urdities crowded together into &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s. All his po&s;itions are indeed &s;o &s;elf evidently ab&s;urd and fal&s;e, that it would be an in&s;ult to American under&s;tandings, &s;eriou&s;ly to attempt refuting them. I &s;hall only beg leave to take no|tice of the curious argument he u&s;es to prove the duty on tea to be no tax, it is that, <HI>unle&s;s we con&s;ent to the tax we are not to pay the duty. We may refu&s;e purcha&s;ing it if we plea&s;e.</HI> The &s;ame logic would demon&s;trate that a duty on beer, candles, or &s;oap, would be no tax, as we are not ab&s;olutely obliged to drink beer; we may drink water, we may go to bed before it is dark, and we are not forced to wa&s;h our &s;hirts. His a&s;&s;er|tion that Great-Britain, when divorced from her Colonies, will &s;till hold the empire of the &s;eas in &s;pite of all the powers of the world, is &s;till more ingenious. It amounts to this, that <HI>without the po&s;&s;ible means of procuring timber, iron, plank, ma&s;ts, pitch, tar, or hemp, to furni&s;h out a &s;ingle frigate, they may build more &s;hips then all the world put together;</HI> that <HI>when her nur&s;ery for &s;eamen is de&s;troyed, and all the commerce on which the exi&s;tence of &s;eamen depends, is annihilated, they will then be able to man more fleets than the whole univer&s;e put together.</HI> But I am a&s;hamed of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the public patience, in making &s;tric|tures on &s;uch ridiculous articles, I &s;hall therefore pa&s;s to &s;ome que&s;tions which have not been &s;o much agitated, and on which, if I mi&s;take not, his reverence lays the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s; for as

he mode&s;tly declares, that he has no opinion of your courage, it was natural for him to con&s;ider intimidation and terror, as the mo&s;t powerful figures of rhetoric. <HI>Regular armies from Great-Britain, He&s;&s;ians, Hanoverians, royal, &s;tandards erected, &s;kilful Generals, legions of Canadians, and unnumbered tribes of &s;avages &s;words flaming in the front and rear, pe&s;tilence, de&s;olation and famine,</HI> are all mar&s;halled in a mo&s;t dreadful order by this church militant author. But let us &s;omewhat minutely exa|mine the picture, and &s;ee whether, &s;tript of its fal&s;e colouring, it has any thing really terrifying. His reverence begins with a&s;&s;uring us, that there is no room to doubt, but that &s;uch an army as was employed in the reduction of Canada (that is an army of &s;even thou&s;and men) would be more than &s;ufficient for the conque&s;t of all the di&s;affected American Colonies, (which are in fact all the Colonies.) Should <HI>&s;uch</HI> a re&s;olution become nece&s;&s;ary in order to reduce them to obedience. For my own part I think there is very great rea&s;on to doubt, that &s;even thou&s;and, even of the be&s;t troops, are able to conquer two hundred thou&s;and of the mo&s;t di&s;orderly pea&s;antry upon earth, if they are animated in defence of every thing they hold mo&s;t dear and &s;acred; and there is &s;till greater rea&s;on to doubt, that &s;even thou&s;and very indifferent troops, compo&s;ed of the refu&s;e of an exhau&s;ted nation, few of whom have &s;een action of any kind, &s;hould be able to conquer two hundred thou&s;and active, vigorous yeomanry, fired with the noble ardor, we &s;ee prevalent through the continent all armed, all expert in the u&s;e of arms almo&s;t from their cradles. The &s;ucce&s;s of Que|bec it is true, does infinite honour to the Engli&s;h arms, the army was, I believe, only &s;even thou&s;and, the enemy were perhaps more than double, but &s;ixteen thou&s;and men are not two hundred thou&s;and. The fate of Canada, depended upon one deci&s;ive action, but it is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate how many victories mu&s;t be gained before the&s;e Colonies could be &s;ub|dued, whereas a &s;ingle victory gained by the Colonies mu&s;t decide the conte&s;t in their favour. In the affair of Quebec there is another circum&s;tance to be con&s;idered, it was Wolfe, who commanded: a man of the mo&s;t wonderful talents, formed to level all difficulties; to render the mo&s;t de&s;picable &s;oldiery, almo&s;t in&s;taneou&s;ly, an army of Heroes. In &s;hort, the genius of the man was &s;o extraordinary, the event was &s;o extraordinary, that no inferences can be drawn from it; but this without pre|&s;umption may be a&s;&s;erted, that no General now exi&s;ting in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, would with double or treble his number have &s;uc|ceeded in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. One thing more I mu&s;t add
<PB N="19" REF="013824_0017_0F91B59ADB04ABF8">
in honour of that illu&s;trious per&s;onage, that the &s;ame greatne&s;s of &s;oul which qualified him to conquer the natural hereditary ene|mies of his country, would have made him reject with horror the Hangman's office, which others who are not endowed with conquering attributes, will with readine&s;s accept.</P>
<P>It is notorious that Mr. Wolfe was not only the fir&s;t of &s;ol|diers, but that he was a mo&s;t liberal virtuous citizen, that he was pa&s;&s;ionately attached to the liberties of his country, and of mankind; and that he was particularly an enemy to large &s;tanding armies in time of peace. It is on the other hand remarkable, that all the advocates for &s;tanding armies; all tho&s;e who are the fonde&s;t of the faddling and parade of war are the mo&s;t active in avoiding real &s;ervice.</P>
<P>This tremendous &s;ooth&s;ayer, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;o great a miracle &s;hould happen in our favour, as that the trifling bo|dy of five hundred thou&s;and men though firmly united (for every man in America, firmly united, would not amount to le&s;s,) &s;hould be able to with&s;tand his &s;even thou&s;and goes on to rattle in our ears, armies of He&s;&s;ians and Hanoverians. I wi&s;h to Heaven he had for once deviated into probability and truth. I wi&s;h ten thou&s;and of them could po&s;&s;ibly be tran&s;|ported to-morrow. The purpo&s;e they would an&s;wer, is a pur|po&s;e devoutly to be wi&s;hed for; they would be an addition to this continent of ju&s;t &s;o many u&s;eful and excellent citizens, for I will venture to affirm, (affirming is infectious) that in le&s;s than four months not two of the&s;e ten thou&s;and would re|main with their Colours. But does not this Reverend Gen|tleman know that in the year 1764 a convention was formed by mo&s;t of the Princes of the empire, at the head of which convention were the Emperor him&s;elf and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, to prevent the alarming emigrations which threatned depo|pulation to Germany? Does he not know that no troops can march out of the empire without the con&s;ent of the empire? Does he not know that the Elector of Hanover and the Em|peror are upon exceedingly ill terms? Does he not know that the Elector of Hanover and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia are &s;till upon wor&s;e? Is he &s;ure that the Landgrave of He&s;s would &s;ell his troops (for as not one man would return back to their coun|try, he mu&s;t con&s;ider them as for ever &s;old?) Is he &s;ure that as the finances of Great-Britain &s;tand, the va&s;t &s;um nece&s;&s;ary for this purcha&s;e would be conveniently found? Is he &s;ure that the State of Hanover would con&s;ent to &s;uch a draining of their country? I know not how it is; but his mo&s;t excellent Ma|je&s;ty GEORGE the Third, who in England is ju&s;tly e&s;teem|ed
<PB N="20" REF="013824_0018_0F91B59B9FAA23E0">
the mo&s;t gracious of Sovereigns, the wife&s;t, greate&s;t, and be&s;t of Kings, is not very popular in the Electorate of Han|over. The&s;e people &s;eem to think it hard that Two Hun|dred and Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds &s;hould annually be drawn from them, for the purpo&s;es (as they conceive it) of corrupt|ing the Members of St. Stephen's Chapel, in order to &s;upport the power and authority of a &s;ett of men, who from the be|ginning have been enemies to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Hanover line, and who &s;hewed a particular animo&s;ity to their la&s;t and favourite Prince, George the Second; but the&s;e difficulties (great and unfurmountable as to a common mortal they ap|pear) our divine Exorci&s;t has in an in&s;tant conjured down, and by a &s;ingle motion of his enchanted wand, has tran&s;ported whole armies, in &s;pite of their re&s;pective Princes, and with|out the con&s;ent of their re&s;pective States, from the inte|rior parts of Germany acro&s;s the Atlantic into the plains of New-England and Penn&s;ylvania. But he does not confine him&s;elf to the introduction of his Germans. He proceeds next to erect the Royal Standard, to which he tells us that all who have the courage to declare them&s;elves now friends to government, will undoubtedly re&s;ort, and the&s;e he &s;ays in a good cau&s;e, will be of them&s;elves formidable to their oppo&s;ers: Dreadfully formidable they mu&s;t be indeed: There would re|&s;ort to it, let me &s;ee, (for the re&s;pectable town of Rye have declared them&s;elves a kind of neutrals <HI>rather than friends to government</HI>) there would re&s;ort to it, Mr. Ju&s;tice Sewell, the honourable Mr. Paxton, Brigadier Ruggles, and about eight or ten more mandamus Councilmen, with perhaps twice their number of Expectants, and not le&s;s than twenty of the unre|canted Hutchin&s;onian Addre&s;&s;ers. The&s;e the four Provinces of New-England alone would &s;end forth. New-York would furni&s;h &s;ix, &s;even or probably eight volunteers from a certain knot, who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or expectation of contracts, and the fourth part of a dozen of high flying Church of England Romani&s;ed Prie&s;ts. I repre&s;ent to my&s;elf the formidable coun|tenance they will make, when arranged under the Royal or mini&s;terial Standard; but what will add to the terror of the appearance, will be their Reverend Pontifex him&s;elf, whom I conceive marching in the front, an inqui&s;itorial frown upon his brow, his bands and canonicals floating to the air, bearing a cro&s;s in his hands, with the tremendous motto, <HI>In hoc &s;igno vinces,</HI> flaming upon it in capital letters of blood, leading them on, and exciting them to victory. It is impo&s;&s;ible that men, who are not under an infatuation by the judgment of heaven &s;hould flatter them&s;elves, that forty thou&s;and Ameri|can

Yeomanry (for we are a&s;&s;ured by the &s;ame great authority that more than forty thou&s;and cannot be brought to action) &s;hould &s;tand the &s;hock of this dreadful Phalanx.</P>
<P>But I &s;hould beg pardon for attempting to be ludicrous upon a &s;ubject which demands our utmo&s;t indignation. I &s;hall now therefore on the pre&s;umption that the People of England &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t to &s;en&s;e, virtue and &s;pirit as to &s;uffer their profligate Mi&s;rulers to per&s;evere in their pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, en|deavour to &s;tate to you what is their force, and what is yours. I &s;hall endeavour to remove the fal&s;e terrors which this writer would hold out, in order to intimidate you from the defence of your liberties and tho&s;e of your po&s;terity, that he and his &s;imilars may wallow in &s;inecures and benefices heaped up from the fruits of your labour and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Great-Britain has, I believe, of infantry at home (compre|hending Ireland, and exclu&s;ive of the guards) fifteen thou&s;and men. They find the greate&s;t difficulty in keeping the regi|ments up to any thing near their e&s;tabli&s;hment&mdash;what they are able to procure are of the wor&s;t &s;ort. They are compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t debauched Weavers prentices, the &s;cum of the Iri&s;h Roman Catholics, who de&s;ert upon every occa&s;ion, and a few, very few, Scotch, who are not &s;trong enough to carry packs&mdash;This is no exaggeration; tho&s;e who have been lately at Bo&s;ton, repre&s;ent the &s;oldiers there (one or two regiments excepted) as very defective in &s;ize, and apparently in &s;trength: But we &s;hall be told they are &s;till regulars, and regulars have an irre&s;i&s;table advantage.&mdash;There is, perhaps, more impo&s;ition in the term <HI>regular troops,</HI> than in any of the jargon which i&s;&s;ues from the mouth of a Quack Doctor. I do not mean to in&s;inuate, that a di&s;|orderly mob are equal to a trained di&s;ciplined body of men; but I mean, that all the e&s;&s;entials nece&s;&s;ary to form infantry for real &s;ervice may be acquired in a few months.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There cannot be a &s;tronger illu&s;tration of the truth here advanced, than the Pru&s;&s;ian army. They are compo&s;ed of about one third of the King's own &s;ubjects, two-thirds foreigners. The third, con&s;i&s;ting of his own &s;ubjects, are, when the exerci&s;ing &s;ea&s;on is over, (which la&s;ts &s;ix or &s;even weeks) &s;uffer|ed to return to their families, and attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;bandry&mdash;half of the other two thirds, con&s;i&s;ting of foreigners, are not only permitted, but encouraged to work at their trades in the garri&s;on towns, and never touch a mu&s;ket for the re&s;t of the year, &s;o that, in fact, only one third are, in the mo|dern language, to be called regular Soldiers; the&s;e generally make their e&s;cape the fir&s;t opportunity: It may be &s;aid therefore, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has gained all his victories with a &s;ort of Militia.</NOTE> I mean, that it is very po&s;&s;ible for men to be cloathed in red, to be ex|pert in all the tricks of the parade, to call them&s;elves regular

troops, and yet, by attaching them&s;elves principally or &s;olely to the tin&s;el and &s;hew of war, be totally unfit for real &s;ervice. This, I am told, is a good deal the ca&s;e of the pre&s;ent Briti&s;h Infantry; If they can acquit them&s;elves tolerably in the puer|ile reviews, exhibited for the amu&s;ement of royal Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;&s;es in Hyde Park or Wimbledon Common, it is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the late war, &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed regular regiments were &s;ent over to this country; they were well dre&s;&s;ed; they were well powdered; they were perfect ma&s;ters of their manual exerci&s;e; they fired together in pla|toons; but fatal experience taught us they knew not how to &s;ight. While your Militia were frequently crowned with &s;uc|ce&s;s, the&s;e regulars were defeated or baffled for three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in every part of the continent. At length, indeed, (after repeated lo&s;&s;es and di&s;graces) they became excellent troops, but not until they had ab&s;olutely forgotten every thing which, we are a&s;&s;ured, mu&s;t render regulars quite irre&s;i&s;table. The corps &s;ent from this country under General Monkton was, I believe, for its number, one of the be&s;t armies that ever was led to conque&s;t, and yet, if I have been rightly informed, there was not a &s;ingle regiment of them that could go through the manual exerci&s;e, or at be&s;t, they performed it mo&s;t wretch|edly. It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that when, after their glorious and rapid conque&s;t of Martinico, they were joined by the &s;pruce regiments from Europe; &s;uch was their uncough appearance, that they were &s;carce honoured with the title of Soldiers by tho&s;e Gentlemen. Upon the whole, it is mo&s;t certain, that men may be &s;martly dre&s;&s;ed, keep their arms bright, be called regulars, be expert in all the anticks of a review, and yet be very unfit for real action. It is equally certain, that a Mili|tia, by confining them&s;elves to e&s;&s;entials, by a &s;implification of the nece&s;&s;ary manoeuvres, may become, in a very few months, a mo&s;t formidable infantry. The Yeomanry of Ame|rica have, be&s;ides infinite advantages, over the pea&s;antry of other countries; they are accu&s;tomed from their infancy to fire arms; they are expert in the u&s;e of them: Whereas the lower and middle people of England are, by the tyranny of certain laws almo&s;t as ignorant in the u&s;e of a mu&s;ket, as they are of the ancient Catepulta. The Americans are likewi&s;e, to a man, &s;kilful in the management of the in&s;tru|ments nece&s;&s;ary for all military works; &s;uch as &s;pades, pick|axes, hatchets, &amp;c. Taking, therefore, all circum&s;tances into con&s;ideration, there will be no ra&s;hne&s;s in affirming, that this continent may have formed for action, in three or four months,
<PB N="23" REF="013824_0021_0F91B59EA948EC88">
an hundred thou&s;and infantry: For as to the a&s;&s;ertion of one friendly advi&s;er, <HI>that no more than forty thou&s;and could act to advantage,</HI> I confe&s;s I do not under&s;tand it, nor does he, I believe, under&s;tand him&s;elf. If he means that &s;ixty thou&s;ad men cannot be ranged in a field capable of containing only forty thou&s;and, we &s;hall all agree with him; but how in the operations of a war upon a va&s;t continent double this number &s;hould be a di&s;advantage, I can have no conception.</P>
<P>Let one &s;imple general plan be adopted for the formation and &s;ubdivi&s;ion of your battalions; let them be in&s;tructed only in &s;o much of the manual exerci&s;e as to prevent confu&s;ion, and accident in loading and firing; let them be taught to form, to retreat, to advance, to change their front, to rally by their colours; let them be taught to reduce them&s;elves from a line of fire to a line of impre&s;&s;ion, that is, from two deep, to four, &s;ix, or eight. This is all &s;o ea&s;y and &s;imple, that it may be acquired in three months. Let &s;ome plan of this &s;ort be adopted. I &s;ay, and there is no doubt but that, in the time I have pre&s;cribed, you may have an army on foot of &s;eventy, eighty, or an hundred thou&s;and men, equal to all the &s;ervices of war.</P>
<P>Should this be admitted, it will be &s;till objected, that you have no able officers to conduct you. I do not know that you have; but is it certain that tho&s;e &s;ent to dragoon you have better? I have taken &s;ome pains to inform my&s;elf what methods the&s;e Gentlemen, &s;aid to be bred to arms, take to qualify them&s;elves in a &s;uperior degree for the profe&s;&s;ion. What is their rotine of in&s;truction? Do they read much? I am a&s;&s;ured that they do not; from books alone the theory of war can be acquired, and the Engli&s;h &s;ervice in times of peace affords them no practical le&s;&s;ons; for mounting guard once or twice a week, or the preparation for the review of a &s;ingle regiment can never be e&s;teemed as &s;uch.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is much to be lamented, that the Gentlemen of the Army do not apply more of the many lei&s;ure hours they have upon their hands to reading. The majority of them are of a generous di&s;po&s;ition, which, did they cultivate, by conver&s;ing with the great hi&s;torians and orators of antiquity, and the more liberal political writers of our own country, a &s;tanding army would be &s;ome|thing le&s;s an object of jealou&s;y to all virtuous citizens. We might perhaps &s;ee them in&s;tead of being advocates and partizans of the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, a check upon their wickedne&s;s. I am inclined to think that few or none of the offi|cers have conde&s;cended to inform them&s;elves of the merit of the pre&s;ent con|te&s;t. Let me conjure them for once to read coolly and candidly the whole proce&s;s, afterwards to lay their hands upon their hearts, and an&s;wer, whether the People of America in general, and of Bo&s;ton in particular, are "more &s;in|ned again&s;t or finning?"</P><P>Now I am upon the &s;ubject of the Officers of the Army, I take the oppor|tunity of mentinning, with the re&s;pect due to him, one Gentleman of high rank among&s;t them&mdash;the tenure of his conduct while in command, was &s;o liberal, and his letters quoted in the Hou&s;e of Commons, were &s;o fair, candid and friendly to this Continent, that he is entitled to the thanks of America. He is indeed of a country that owes not only its pro&s;perity, but its exi&s;tence to the &s;ame principles which actuate America.</P></NOTE></P>

Another circum&s;tance, Americans, may be added for your comfort. It has been allowed by &s;ome of the mo&s;t candid of the regulars them&s;elves, that during the la&s;t war upon this continent, your countrymen the provincial Field-Officers were in general, more under&s;tanding and capable than their own of the &s;ame rank. But the hi&s;tory of the civil war in the year 1641, furni&s;hes us with the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tances that excellent officers may be &s;oon formed from country gentlemen, citizens, lawyers, and Farmers. The Parliament's army (as our prie&s;tly writer would call them, the rebellious Republicans) were chiefly compo&s;ed of this cla&s;s of men. In the beginning of this war, they were treated with the &s;ame affected contempt, and almo&s;t in the &s;ame opprobious terms as you, the people of America, are by your friendly and decent advi&s;er.</P>
<P>Whoever would infer from the tenure of the&s;e papers, that the writer is de&s;irous of precipitating, or could look with in|difference upon the calamities of a civil war, does him great inju&s;tice. He con&s;iders them with all the horror natural to a feeling man and hone&s;t citizen. He execrates the memory of tho&s;e men to whom they may ju&s;tly be attributed, but he is per&s;uaded that they never originated, (at lea&s;t in &s;tates of any con&s;iderable extent) in the turbulent di&s;po&s;itions of the people, nor in the arts of demagogues, but in the oppre&s;&s;ion of their rulers, in the wantonne&s;s, folly, pride, or avarice of Kings, Mini&s;ters, or Governors. The Gri&s;lers of Switzerland the Granvels of Holland, the Lauds and Straffords of England, were the undoubted authors of the tragedies acted in their re|&s;pective countries: And if this continent &s;hould be &s;tained with the blood of a &s;ingle citizen, it can never be charged to the unrea&s;onable preten&s;ions of the people, but to the Bernards, Hutchin&s;ons, and &s;ome other traitors of a &s;imilar &s;tamp.</P>
<P>He is convinced, that being prepared for a civil war is the &s;ure&s;t means of preventing it; that to keep the &s;words of your enemies in their &s;cabbards, you mu&s;t whet your own. He is convinced, that remon&s;trances, petitions, prayers and &s;upplca|tions
<PB N="25" REF="013824_0023_0F91B5A098C92F30">
will make no impre&s;&s;ion on our callous Court and aban|doned Parliament; England, Ireland, America, even Guern|&s;ey, Jer&s;ey and Minorca are witne&s;&s;es of their ine&s;&s;icacy. He in convinced, that fear alone can operate; there are &s;ymptoms that it already begins to operate; the mon&s;ter, Tyranny, already begins to pant, pre&s;s her now with ardor, and &s;he is down; al|ready the Mini&s;try have expre&s;&s;ed in their letters an inclina|tion to make &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions; to meet you half way. Which, I &s;uppo&s;e, may be con&s;trued thus, that as they find they have it not in their power to e&s;tabli&s;h, by force, the de&s;poti&s;m which they aimed at, they &s;hall be very well &s;atisfied, if you will ju&s;t cede &s;o much of your rights and privileges, as will enable them, by extending their pecuniary influence and &s;ap|ping your virtue, to take away the re&s;t at their lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>There now remains, people of America, one con&s;ideration which (however it may be taken) I think it my duty to offer. Hi&s;tory tells us that the free &s;tates of Greece, Thebes, Sparta, Athens, and Syracu&s;e were all in their turns &s;ubjugated by the force or art of tyrants. They almo&s;t all in their turns re|covered their liberty and de&s;troyed their tyrants. The first act upon the recovery of their liberty was to demoli&s;h tho&s;e badges of &s;lavery, citadels, &s;trong holds, and military tenements; the Switzers did the &s;ame; the people of England (lo&s;t in corrup|tion and lethargy as they are) could never be prevailed upon to &s;uffer barracks among&s;t them; even the courtly Black&s;tone is &s;tartled at the idea. No &s;eperate camps, no barracks no inland fortre&s;&s;es, &s;ays he, &s;hould be allowed; in fact, wherever barracks are freedom cannot be &s;aid to exi&s;t, or &s;he exi&s;ts &s;o lamely as &s;carcely to de&s;erve the name.</P>
<P>It is worth your con&s;ideration, Americans, whether the&s;e badges &s;hould remain or no. I &s;hall now conclude, brave ci|tizens, with invoking the Almighty God from whom all vir|tues flow, to continue you in that &s;pirit of unanimity and vigour which mu&s;t in&s;ure your &s;ucce&s;s, and immortalize you through all ages, as the champions and patrons of the human race.</P>
