This will appear from the Journals of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, where it will be &s;een, that on <HI>June</HI> 21&s;t, 1768, the Re&s;pondent &s;ent a me&s;&s;age, in|clo&s;ing an extract of a letter from the Secretary of State to him the Re&s;pondent, &s;ignifying his Maje&s;ty's plea|&s;ure, that he &s;hould require the Hou&s;e to re&s;cind a Re|&s;olution of a former Hou&s;e, and declare their di&s;appro|bation of the &s;ame.

The petition being ready prepared, was immediately reported and read; and upon debate, it being objected that there was no proof of the facts alledged, the peti|tion was recommitted, and the committee was ordered to bring evidence in &s;upport of divers articles. Thus it re&s;ted until a new A&s;&s;embly met in <HI>May,</HI> 1769, when this Complaint was revived, with &s;ome little alteration, and &s;ome additional articles ari&s;ing from new facts; and

notwith&s;tanding it had been before rejected for want of proof, it was now admit|ted without any proof, and pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e the 27th day of <HI>June</HI> 1769. It has been &s;ince circulated throughout <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in News-Papers, Magazines and Pamphlets; it has been commented upon, and argued from, as true, in different Papers; and the Re&s;pondent has been called upon, by anonymous writers, to an&s;wer this complaint before the public, whil&s;t he was en|deavoring to obtain a hearing of it before the King in Council, and the Agent for the Complainants was doing all he could to prevent it, under a pretence of wait|ing for proofs.</P>
</DIV2>

<P N="1">1. <HI>From his fir&s;t ar|rival here, he has in his &s;peeches and other public acts, treated the Repre&s;entative Body with contempt.</HI></P>
<P N="1" ROLE="commentary">1. And the Re&s;pondent, further an&s;wering, &s;aith, That the fir&s;t article is notoriou&s;ly untrue, it being well known to all who are acquainted with the govern|ment of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay,</HI> that from the time of the pre&s;ent Governor's (the Re&s;pondent's) entering upon that government, which was in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1760, until the oppo&s;ition made to the Stamp-act, which began in the year 1765, a very good under&s;tanding and agreement of &s;entiments and actions between the Governor and the A&s;&s;embly, in both its branches, continually prevailed; of which the Journals of the Hou&s;e afford many pregnant proofs. But, after the oppo&s;ition to the Par|liament was adopted by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, it became impo&s;&s;ible for the Re&s;pondent, or any Governor, to do his duty and pre&s;erve his popularity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="complaint">
<P N="2">2. <HI>He has in his public &s;peeches charged both Hou&s;es of the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly expre&s;ly with oppugnation a|gain&s;t the Royal Au|thority; declaring that they had left Gentle|men out of the Council, only for their fidelity to the Crown.</HI></P>
<P N="2" ROLE="commentary">2. The Re&s;pondent admits, that he did declare that the General A&s;&s;embly left Gentlemen out of the Coun|cil only for their fidelity to the Crown; and if this is to be deemed oppugnation again&s;t the royal authority, he admits this article to be true. And to ju&s;tify &s;uch declaration he ob&s;erves, that, upon the election of Coun|&s;ellors in <HI>May</HI> 1766, (which was about a month after they had received advice of the repeal of the Stamp-act) the majority of the General A&s;&s;embly turned out the Lieutenant Governor (who was al&s;o Chief Ju&s;tice of the Province) the Secretary, two other Judges of the Superior Court, and the Attorney General, all of them men of irreproachable characters, and high e&s;timation among the people. There was no accounting for the depriving the government of the &s;ervice of men of &s;uch high offices, and known abilities and integrity, but from
<PB N="4" REF="011730_0003_0F881C61A22A27A0">
an intention to lower the King's authority in the government, and reduce the royalty of it to mere form, and ve&s;t all the real power in the people. That this was and is &s;till the intention, has been &s;ince made plain by further proceed|ings in &s;ub&s;equent elections, in which every Coun&s;ellor who has been known, be|lieved, or even &s;u&s;pected to be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport the authority of the King and Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or the royal rights of the provincial government, has been turned out of the Council. The Re&s;pondent begs leave to refer to a li&s;t of coun&s;ellors who have been thus turned out at the four la&s;t elections, which, by an enquiry into the characters of the per&s;ons from tho&s;e who are ac|quainted with the province, will fully prove the a&s;&s;ertions above mentioned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="complaint">
<P N="3">3. <HI>He has from time to time indi&s;cretely and wantonly exerci&s;ed the Prerogative of the Crown, in the repeat|ed negative of Coun&s;el|lors of an unblemi&s;hed reputation, and duly elected by a great ma|jority, &s;ome of them by the unanimous &s;uffrage of both Hou&s;es of A&s;|&s;embly.</HI></P>
<P N="3" ROLE="commentary">3. The Re&s;pondent admits, that, &s;ince the exclu&s;ion of the Lieutenant Governor, Secretary, Judges, and Attorney General, from the Council, he has repeatedly u&s;ed the right given to the Governor by the Charter, of negativing per&s;ons elected for Coun&s;ellors, and re|turned to him for his approbation; but he denies that he has acted therein indi&s;creetly or wantonly, or upon any other motive than that of promoting the King's &s;ervice. He has, from time to time, &s;ignified to his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters the principles upon which he formed his conduct in this re&s;pect, and has had the honor to have &s;uch conduct approved of by his Maje&s;ty, as it was &s;ignified to him by the Earl of <HI>Shelburne,</HI> at that time one of his Maje&s;ty's principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, by his letter dated Sept. 17, 1767, which was after the &s;econd time of his exerci&s;ing his negative; from which letter he begs leave to in&s;ert the following words:
 <Q>I have the plea&s;ure to &s;ignify to you his Maje&s;ty's approbation of your con|duct, and to acquaint you, that He is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to approve of your having exerted the power lodged in you by the con&s;titution of the Province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay,</HI> of negativing Coun&s;ellors in the late elections, which appears from your &s;everal letters to have been done with due deliberation &amp; judgment.</Q></P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>He has declared, that certain &s;eats at the council board &s;hall be kept vacant, till cer|tain gentlemen who are his favourites &s;hall be re-elected.</HI></P>
<P N="4" ROLE="commentary">4. The Re&s;pondent denies this article to be true, &s;o far as it relates to the inforcing the re-election of his favorites; for he has no favorites in re&s;pect to the government, but &s;uch as have recommended them&s;elves by fidelity to the King, and ability to &s;erve him. In this light the Lieutenant Governor and the Secretary
<PB N="5" REF="011730_0003_0F881C61A22A27A0">
may be con&s;idered as his favorites; and if &s;uch declaration was made, it was in favour of them and them only: And he believes he did make &s;uch declaration upon the following account. Upon the exclu&s;ion of the&s;e two gentlemen from the Council (of which they had been Members for many years, and by their particular functions, as well as their knowledge of the public bu&s;ine&s;s, were become almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to that body) upon enquiry into the con&s;titution of the pre&s;ent government, it appeared from the u&s;age under the former Charter, from con&s;iderations previous to the granting the pre&s;ent Charter, from the words of the Charter it&s;elf, and from the practice of the fir&s;t year after the opening the Charter, that the Lieutenant Governor and the Secretary had a right to &s;eats and voices in the Council in virtue of their offices, and without being elected thereto, and did actually enjoy &s;uch right for one year as afore&s;aid. But upon the election of a new Council at the end of the fir&s;t year, the A&s;&s;em|bly elected the Lieutenant Governor and the Secretary among the twenty-eight elective Councellors, in&s;tead of permitting them to be &s;uperadded to the elective Councellors, as was de&s;igned by the Charter, and practi&s;ed the year before. The Lieutenant Governor and Secretary acquie&s;cing in this, probably from their unwillingne&s;s to di&s;pute with the A&s;&s;embly, upon whom they were de|pendent, &s;ubmitted to take their &s;eats as elected Councellors, in&s;tead of official members of the Council. And this method prevailing ever after, the King has by the&s;e means been deprived of the &s;ervice of his Lieutenant Governor and Secretary, the nomination of whom he had re&s;erved to him&s;elf, in his Council, where it appears to have been intended they &s;hould have &s;eats in virtue of their offices. And great detriment has aro&s;e to his Maje&s;ty's government by their being excluded the Council at particular times, when they have been mo&s;t wanted, as for late years has been very ob&s;ervable. The Re&s;pondent therefore having di&s;covered this u&s;urpation, and finding it too much confirmed by time for him of him&s;elf to undertake to re&s;tore the Lieutenant Governor &amp; Secretary to their rights, did tran&s;mit an account of it to the King's mini&s;ters, and did mention the &s;ame to the Council of the province, or &s;ome of them, at the &s;ame time declaring, that as the Lieutenant Governor and the Secretary had an inhe|rent right from their Offices to &s;eats in the Council, though they had u&s;ually been reckoned among&s;t the twenty-eight elected, he &s;hould not &s;uffer their &s;eats among the twenty-eight to be filled up by other per&s;ons till they were re&s;tored to their official &s;eats without the twenty-eight. This he did in order to leave it open to the A&s;&s;embly to re&s;tore them to their &s;eats in the u&s;ual way at any time when they &s;hould &s;ee the impropriety of their being in|cluded.</P>

<P N="5" ROLE="commentary">5. The Re&s;pondent &s;ays, that he believes there never was a Governor that le&s;s interfered with elec|tions than he has done; &s;o that he knows not what to refer this charge to, unle&s;s it is to his recommending a provincial Agent in the year 1765. This he did, and certainly had a right to do, as the provincial Agent is the Agent of the whole General Court, of which the Governor is a part, and mu&s;t be con&s;ented to and commi&s;&s;ioned by the Governor before his appoint|ment is complete. The Gentleman he recommended was accordingly cho&s;en, and &s;erved the province for two years, and was the mo&s;t able and re&s;pectable Agent that the province ever had.</P>

<P N="6" ROLE="commentary">6. The Governor of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay has no power to di&s;place Civil Officers without the con&s;ent of the Council; and hence it is, that many per&s;ons hold their Offices in that province who ought to have been di&s;placed long ago. He has indeed a free power over. Military Officers; but has made very little u&s;e of it, except in &s;uper&s;eding &s;ome few commi&s;&s;ions of per&s;ons who profe&s;&s;ed and abetted &s;uch principles as made them very unfit to have military commands under the King.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="complaint">
<P N="7">7. <HI>He has in an unwarrantable man|ner taken upon him&s;elf the exerci&s;e of your Maje&s;ty's royal prero|gative, in granting a charter for a college, contrary to an expre&s;s vote of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and without even a&s;king the advice of your Maje&s;ty's Council.</HI></P>
<P N="7" ROLE="commentary">7. The Re&s;pondent never had any doubt but that he had a right to grant Charters of incorporation un|der the King's &s;eal, of which he is the keeper, as is practi&s;ed by all other royal Governors in America. And he did once, &s;ome years ago, order a Charter to be made out for e&s;tabli&s;hing a collegiate School in the extreme parts of the province, upon the petition of divers re&s;pectable per&s;ons inhabitants of the &s;aid parts, who were ready to endow the &s;aid School. But un|der&s;tanding that the propo&s;ed Charter gave umbrage to the College at Cambridge near Bo&s;ton, he, upon that account only, and not out of any doubt of his power to grant &s;uch a charter, or the rea&s;onablene&s;s and propriety of the charter prayed for, put a &s;top to the &s;ame being i&s;&s;ued: And this is the only Charter that was ever agitated before him &s;ince he has been Governor of that province.</P>

<P N="8" ROLE="commentary">8. The Re&s;pondent knows not what Depo&s;itions are here referred to, except it be tho&s;e which it may be &s;uppo&s;ed he has tran&s;mitted to his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, in obedience to his Maje&s;ty's commands &s;ignified to him for that purpo&s;e. And he is &s;orry to &s;ay, that he has not done &s;o much in that re&s;pect as may have been ex|pected of him: For when he received &s;uch commands, he found the intimidation which the faction by their former outrages had rai&s;ed in Bo&s;ton &s;o great and uni|ver&s;al, that there was a general unwillingne&s;s in peo|ple of all kinds, to give a formal te&s;timony again&s;t any of the factions party, even of facts which they made no &s;cruple to declare their knowledge of in the cour&s;e of common conver&s;ation. And therefore having no power to oblige people to give te&s;timony, and finding it impracticable to procure voluntary evidence, he could not execute the King's commands with that punctuality with which he has always been de&s;irous to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in all acts of duty.</P>
<P ROLE="commentary">And here it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that the preceding article, and all the following articles, are charges again&s;t him for doing acts which were dictated to him either by the duty of his office or by his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions given un|der his Sign Manual, or by his &s;pecial commands &s;ignified by his Secretary of State. And in all ca&s;es, where the Re&s;pondent is charged with acts which were known to be done in obedience to his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions, or His &s;pecial Orders, he cannot con&s;ider him&s;elf to be chargeable with &s;uch acts; but &s;uch charge mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be, and to be intended to be, directed immediately again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's admini&s;tration.

The Re&s;pon|dent has not only had this duty pre&s;cribed to him by his general in&s;tructions, but has been often reminded of it in the letters of his Maje&s;ty's Secretaries of State. In doing this, he has &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition the very con|trary to that of mi&s;repre&s;enting his Maje&s;ty's loving &s;ubjects of the colony in general, and has endeavored

The preamble of this article, whereby the Re|&s;pondent is charged with being a principal in&s;trument in procuring the military force which was &s;ent to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> has &s;ince been fal&s;ified by the party publi&s;hing the Re&s;pondent's letters, from &s;ome of which it appears, that he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to apply for troops unle&s;s the Council would join with him in it; which they refu&s;|ing to do, he never applied for troops. As for the charge it&s;elf, the fact was this: Having received his Maje&s;ty's orders to take every nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep for the accommodation of his troops at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> he applied to the Council, to the Select-Men of the town, and to all the ju&s;tices in the town, whom he called together for that purpo&s;e, being all the per&s;ons that could be pointed out by the Act of Parliaments for quartering &s;oldiers, &s;eve|rally and &s;eparately, de&s;iring them to provide quarters for the &s;oldiers. This they all refu&s;ed to do; &s;o that when the commanding officer found him&s;elf obliged to land two regiments at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> there were no quarters for them. Whereupon the commanding officer applying to the Re&s;pondent to provide a covering for one of the regiments, who had no camp-equipage with them, until they could hire buildings at the King's expence to make barracks of, the Re&s;pondent a&s;&s;igned to them &s;everal rooms in the Town-hou&s;e, which were not then in u&s;e, among which was the Repre&s;entatives chamber; and there the regiment remained, without any inconvenience to the public, or any per&s;ons what&s;oever, until barracks were provided for them. What enhances the fal&s;ity
<PB N="11" REF="011730_0006_0F881C63E23406F8">
and virulence of this charge is, that the party who has preferred it knew that the Re&s;pondent acted in this bu&s;ine&s;s under the King's &s;pecial orders, and that his Maje&s;ty has &s;ince been plea&s;ed to &s;ignify his full approbation of his Conduct, under the difficulties that were continually thrown in his way.

<P N="14" ROLE="commentary">14. This article is of the &s;ame complexion with the preceeding, but much more fal&s;e and prevaricating. The fact upon which it is founded is this: The King ordered two Regiments, to be &s;ent from <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be landed at <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> and al&s;o two other Regiments to be &s;ent from <HI>Halifax</HI> to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> The two Regiments from <HI>Halifax</HI> arrived fir&s;t; and the commanding officer, &s;ig|nifying to the Re&s;pondent that he had orders to &s;tation both tho&s;e regiments at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> demanded quarters. The Re&s;pondent con&s;ulted the Council, and by their advice applied to the Select men of the town, and then to the Ju&s;tices of Peace, and la&s;t of all to the Council them&s;elves: But they all refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign any quarters to the two regiments, under different pretences; the principal of which was, that they ought to be quar|tered at the ca&s;tle, upon an i&s;land, di&s;tant from the town of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> three miles by &s;ea and &s;even miles by land, where there were barracks that would hold only one regiment, and that but inconveniently, as has been &s;ince proved. And though the impo&s;&s;ibility of quartering four regiments in barracks that could hold but one, and the impropriety of quartering troops in an i&s;land di&s;|tant from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which were expre&s;&s;ly ordered to be &s;tationed at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> were urged again and again, they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing quarters: Wherefore the Commander in Chief found him&s;elf obliged to hire buildings, and fit them up for barracks, at the King's expence, for three of the regiments, after having a&s;&s;igned the barracks at the Ca&s;tle for the other regiment. And endeavors were u&s;ed to defeat even this the only method left for executing the King's commands; for it was given out by the faction, that if any &s;oldiers were put into &s;uch barracks, the officers commanding &s;uch &s;oldiers would be pro&s;ecuted for quartering &s;oldiers
<PB N="12" REF="011730_0007_0F881C64A224B130">
without the interpo&s;ition of a magi&s;trate, contrary to the Mutiny-Act, and, being convicted thereof by two ju&s;tices, would incur the penalty of being ca&s;hiered: To prevent this abu&s;e of the act, the Re&s;pondent, at the reque&s;t of General <HI>Gage,</HI> Commander in chief, granted a commi&s;&s;ion to an officer of his to place the &s;oldiers in the barracks, which &s;hould be provided for them at the King's expence. And this is the fact upon which the charge again&s;t the Re&s;pondent, for eva&s;ively ap|pointing an officer to provide quarters for the troops otherwi&s;e than is pre&s;cribed by the act, is founded. The Re&s;pondent is &s;orry that he is obliged, by the de|&s;igned generality of the charge, in his defence thereto, to &s;tate &s;uch a detail of un|truth, prevarications, and contempt of law and authority, in the promoters of the accu&s;ation again&s;t him: But it is all to be accounted for by the propa|gation of one maxim, which originated with the faction, and has lately been adopted by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, That the King has no right to order any of his troops into any of the <HI>American</HI> provinces, without being fir&s;t authorized &s;o to do by an Act of the provincial A&s;&s;embly. And from this preten&s;ion the tran&s;ition is ea&s;y to the pre&s;umption of petitioning the King to puni&s;h an officer of his, for obeying his commands, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to carry his orders into execution.</P>

The facts, upon which this article is founded, are the&s;e: In <HI>June</HI> 1768, while the a&s;&s;embly of the province was &s;itting, the Re&s;pondent received a letter from the Secretary of State, &s;ignifying the King's plea|&s;ure, that he &s;hould require of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives to re&s;cind a Re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed in a former Hou&s;e, and to declare their di&s;approbation of it; and, if they &s;hould refu&s;e to comply, that he &s;hould immediately di&s;&s;olve them.

<P N="16" ROLE="commentary">16. It is the undoubted duty of a Governor to accom|pany his reports of intere&s;ting proceedings in his province with his own opinion of them; and it is indi&s;pen&s;able, when he is giving an account of di&s;orders in his govern|ment, to endeavour to trace the cau&s;es of them, &amp; to point out the remedies. In the province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> when civil authority was reduced &s;o low as to have nothing left but the form of a government, and &s;carce even that, an enquiry into the cau&s;es of &s;o great a weak|ne&s;s in the governing powers was unavoidable; and there was no entering upon &s;uch an enquiry, without ob&s;erving upon the ill effects of that part of the con&s;titu|tion of that government, whereby the appointment of the Council if left to the people, to be made by annual election; and yet the Royal Governor, in all Acts of Prerogative, is &s;ubject to the controul of the Democratical Council. This &s;oleci&s;m in policy has been as hurtful in practice as it is ab&s;urd in Theory, and is the true cau&s;e of the extreme imbecility of the power of the Crown in this government, at Times when the exer|tion of it is mo&s;t wanted. This is not an ob&s;ervation of a new date; it is of many years &s;tanding; and the avowal of the Re&s;pondent's opinion on this occa&s;ion, is not to be reckoned from the date of his Letters to the Earl of <HI>Hillsborough:</HI> He has made no &s;cruple to de|clare his &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject, ever &s;ince he has felt the effects which the popular con&s;titution of the

This, and this only, is the foundation of the charge of his endeavouring to overthrow the Char|ter; whereas his real de&s;ire has been, that the Charter &s;hould have a more durable &s;tability, by means of a nece&s;&s;ary alteration, without which, he is per&s;uaded it cannot have a much longer duration; as the abu&s;e of the ap|pointment of the Council now prevailing, mu&s;t oblige the Parliament to interfere &s;ooner or later. And therefore he is per&s;uaded, that, in avowing this opinion, he has acted not only as a faithful &s;ervant to the King, and a true &s;ubject of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> but al&s;o as a real friend of the province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay,</HI> who&s;e true intere&s;t it is, to have its government &s;o confirmed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, that it may not be liable to be continually di&s;turbed and di&s;graced by factions and de&s;igning men, as it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
