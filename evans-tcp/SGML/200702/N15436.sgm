<P>As the ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> woman is of a &s;ingular nature, has engro&s;&s;ed the public attention; and as there are v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ports circulating re&s;pecting her, the following narrative, drawn up at the reque&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> unconnected with her, may be acceptable at this time.</P>
<P>WAS found, by a per&s;on with a dog, cro&s;&s;ing the fields, in a piece of woods a little di&s;tance from the road leading from Brandywine to the Turk's Head, two dead infants. Upon enquiry, and from concurring circum&s;tances, there was rea|&s;on to conclude, they were Elizabeth Wil&s;on's; who &s;ome time before was delivered of two children, not far from the place where they were found, and who about eight week before, had left the hou&s;e with the children; having a de&s;ign, as &s;he &s;aid, of going <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Philadelphia. She was accordingly apprehended, and after examination before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Taylor, was ordered to this jail.</P>
<P>She was brought to trial the la&s;t court of Oyer and Terminer, which commenced on the 17th of October la&s;t, before the Honorable Judge Atlee; circum&s;tances were &s;o &s;trong again&s;t her, that &s;he was brought in guilty, and received &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>Before, at, and after her trial, &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in denying the fact; her behaviour was &s;uch, in general, as gave rea&s;ons to conclude &s;he was innocent of the murder of which &s;he was charged, or was an in&s;en&s;ible, hardened creature, and did not expect to die for this crime.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time after &s;he was &s;entenced, before &s;he could be prevailed upon to make a di&s;covery of the per&s;on that committed the horrid murder. A great deal of pains were taken to make her &s;en&s;ible that a promi&s;e of concealment, under the circum&s;tances &s;he was in when made, and in a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence, was not binding.
