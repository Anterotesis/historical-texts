<P>THE attentive gravity, the venerable appearance of this crouded audience, the dignity which I behold in the countenances of &s;o many in this great A&s;&s;embly, the &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion upon which we have met together, join'd to a con&s;ideration of the part I am to take in the important bu&s;ine&s;s of this day, fill me with an awe hitherto un|known; and heighten the &s;en&s;e which I have ever had, of my un|worthine&s;s to fill this &s;acred de&s;k; but, allur'd by the call of &s;ome of my re&s;pected fellow-citizens, with who&s;e reque&s;t it is always my greate&s;t plea&s;ure to comply, I almo&s;t forgot my want of ability to perform what they required. In this &s;ituation, I find my only &s;up|port, in a&s;&s;uring my&s;elf that a generous people will not &s;everely cen&s;ure what they know was well intended, though it's want of
<PB N="6" REF="013314_0005_0F8FFB4B9E6572C8">
merit, &s;hould prevent their being able to applaud it. And I pray, that my &s;incere attachment to the intere&s;t of my country, and hearty dete&s;tation of every de&s;ign formed again&s;t her liberties, may be ad|mitted as &s;ome apology for my appearance in this place.</P>
<P>I HAVE always from my earlie&s;t youth, rejoiced in the felicity of my Fellow-men, and have ever con&s;ider'd it as the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of every member of &s;ociety to promote, as far as in him lies, the pro&s;perity of every individual, but more e&s;pecially of the com|munity to which he belongs; and al&s;o, as a faithful &s;ubject of the &s;tate, to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to detect, and having detected, &s;trenuou&s;ly to oppo&s;e every traiterous plot which its enemies may devi&s;e for its de&s;truction. Security to the per&s;ons and properties of the governed, is &s;o obviou&s;ly the de&s;ign and end of civil govern|ment, that to attempt a logical proof of it, would be like burning tapers at noon-day, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;un in enlightening the world; and it cannot be either virtuous or honorable, to attempt to &s;upport a government, of which this is not the great and principal ba&s;is; and it is to the la&s;t degree vicious and infamous to attempt to &s;upport a government which manife&s;tly tends to render the per&s;ons and pro|perties of the governed in&s;ecure. Some boa&s;t of being <HI>friends to government</HI>; I am a friend to <HI>righteous</HI> government, to a govern|ment founded upon the principles of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice; but I glory in publickly avowing my eternal enmity to tyranny. Is the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem which the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration have adopted for the govern|ment of the colonies, a righteous government? Or is it tyranny?&mdash; Here &s;uffer me to a&s;k (and would to Heaven there could be an

an&s;wer) What tenderne&s;s? What regard, re&s;pect or con&s;ideration has <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hewn in their late tran&s;actions for the &s;ecurity of the per&s;ons or properties of the inhabitants of the colonies? or rather, What have they omitted doing to de&s;troy that &s;ecurity? They have declared that they have, ever had, and of right ought ever to have, full power to make laws of &s;ufficient validity to bind the colonies in all ca&s;es whatever: They have exerci&s;ed this pretended right by impo&s;ing a tax upon us without our con&s;ent; and le&s;t we &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome reluctance at parting with our property, her fleets and armies are &s;ent to inforce their mad preten&s;ions. The town of Bo&s;ton, ever faithful to the Briti&s;h Crown, has been inve&s;ted by a Briti&s;h fleet: The troops of George the Third have cro&s;s'd the wide atlantick, not to engage an enemy, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t a band of TRAITORS in trampling on the rights and liberties of his mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects in America,&mdash;tho&s;e rights and liberties which as a father he ought ever to regard, and as a King he is bound in ho|nour to defend from violations, even at the ri&s;que of his own life.</P>
<P>LET not the hi&s;tory of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick inform po&s;terity, that a King de&s;cended from that glorious monarch George the &s;econd, once &s;ent his Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to conquer and en&s;lave his &s;ubjects in America; but be perpetual infamy entail'd upon that villain who dared to advi&s;e his Ma&s;ter to &s;uch execrable mea&s;ures; for it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee the con&s;equences which &s;o naturally fol|lowed upon &s;ending troops into America, to enforce obedience to acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, which neither God nor man ever empowered them to make. It was rea&s;onable to expect that troops
<PB N="8" REF="013314_0007_0F8FFB4C8E8B30B8">
who knew the errand they were &s;ent upon, would treat the people whom they were to &s;ubjugate, with a cruelty and haughtine&s;s, which too often buries the honorable character of a <HI>&s;oldier,</HI> in the di&s;grace|ful name of an <HI>unfeeling ruffian.</HI> The troops upon their fir&s;t arri|val took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Senate Hou&s;e, and pointed their cannon again&s;t the Judgment-hall, and even continued them there whil&s;t the Supreme Court of Judicature for this Province was actually &s;itting to decide upon the lives and fortunes of the King's &s;ubjects.&mdash; Our &s;treets nightly re&s;ounded with the noi&s;e of riot and debauchery; our peaceful citizens were hourly expo&s;ed to &s;hameful in&s;ults, and often felt the effects of their violence and outrage. But this was not all: As though they thought it not enough to violate our civil Rights, they endeavoured to deprive us of the enjoyment of our religious privileges, to viciate our morals, and thereby render us de|&s;erving of de&s;truction. Hence the rude din of arms which broke in upon your &s;olemn devotions in your temples, on that day hallow|ed by Heaven, and &s;et apart by God him&s;elf for his peculiar wor|&s;hip. Hence, impious oaths and bla&s;phemies &s;o often tortur'd your unaccu&s;tomed ear. Hence, all the arts which idlene&s;s and luxury could invent, were u&s;ed, to betray our youth of one &s;ex into extra|vagance and effeminacy, and of the other to infamy and ruin; and did they not &s;ucceed but too well? Did not a reverence for reli|gion &s;en&s;ibly decay? Did not our infants almo&s;t learn to li&s;p out cur&s;es before they knew their horrid import? Did not our youth forget they were Americans, and regardle&s;s of the admonitions of the wi&s;e and aged, &s;ervilely copy from their tyrants tho&s;e vices which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t overthrow the empire of Great-Britain? And mu&s;t I be
<PB N="9" REF="013314_0008_0F90F1BA00E66C48">
compelled to acknowledge, that even the noble&s;t, faire&s;t part of all the lower creation did not entirely e&s;cape the cur&s;ed &s;nare? When virtue has once erected her throne within the female brea&s;t, it is upon &s;o &s;olid a ba&s;is that nothing is able to expel the heavenly inhabitant. But have there not been &s;ome, few indeed, I hope, who&s;e youth and inexperience have render'd them a prey to wretches, whom upon the lea&s;t reflection, they would have de&s;pi&s;ed and hated as foes to God and their country? I fear there have been &s;ome &s;uch unhappy in&s;tances; or why have I &s;een an hone&s;t father cloathed with &s;hame? or why a virtuous mother drowned in tears?</P>
<P>BUT I forbear, and come reluctantly to the tran&s;actions of that di&s;mal night, when in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion we felt the extremes of grief, a&s;toni&s;hment and rage; when Heaven in anger, for a dread|ful moment, &s;uffer'd Hell to take the reins; when Satan with his cho&s;en band open'd the &s;luices of New-England's blood, and &s;acri|legiou&s;ly polluted our land with the dead bodies of her guiltle&s;s &s;ons. Let this &s;ad tale of death never be told without a tear; let not the heaving bo&s;om cea&s;e to burn with a manly indignation at the barba|rous &s;tory, thro' the long tracts of future time: Let every parent tell the &s;hameful &s;tory to his li&s;tening children till tears of pity gli&s;ten in their eyes, and boiling pa&s;&s;ion &s;hakes their tender frames; and whil&s;t the anniver&s;ary of that ill-fated night is kept a jubilee in the grim court of pandaemonium, let all America join in one com|mon prayer to Heaven, that, the inhuman, unprovok'd murders of the Fifth of March 1770, planned by Hill&s;borough, and a knot of treacherous knaves in Bo&s;ton, and executed by the cruel hand of
<PB N="10" REF="013314_0009_0F8FFB4E49029C30">
Pre&s;ton and his &s;anguinary coadjutors, may ever &s;tand on hi&s;tory without a parallel. But what, my countrymen, with-held the ready arm of vengeance from executing in&s;tant ju&s;tice on the vile a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins? Perhaps you fear'd promi&s;cuous carnage might en&s;ue, and that the innocent might &s;hare the fate of tho&s;e who had performed the in|fernal deed. But were not all guilty? Were you not too ten|der of the lives of tho&s;e who came to fix a yoke on your necks? But I mu&s;t not too &s;everely blame a fault, which great &s;ouls only can commit. May that magnificence of &s;pirit which &s;corns the low pur&s;uits of malice, may that generous compa&s;|&s;ion which often pre&s;erves from ruin, even a guilty villain, fore|ver actuate the noble bo&s;oms of Americans!&mdash;But let not the mi&s;creant ho&s;t vainly imagine that we fear'd their arms. No; them we de&s;pis'd; we dread nothing but &s;lavery. Death is the creature of a Poltroon's brains; 'tis immortality, to &s;acrifice our|&s;elves for the &s;alvation of our country. We fear not death. That gloomy night, the pale fac'd moon, and the affrighted &s;tars that hurried through the &s;ky, can witne&s;s that we fear not death.&mdash; Our hearts, which at the recollection glow with a rage that four revolving years have &s;carcely taught us to re&s;train, can witne&s;s that we fear not death; and happy 'tis for tho&s;e who dared to in&s;ult us, that their naked bones are not now piled up an everla&s;ting monu|ment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's bravery. But they retir'd, they fled, and in that flight they found their only &s;afety. We then expected that the hand of publick ju&s;tice would &s;oon inflict that puni&s;hment upon the murderers, which by the laws of God and man they had incur|red. But let the unbia&s;s'd pen of a Robin&s;on, or perhaps of &s;ome
<PB N="11" REF="013314_0010_0F8FFB4F086C4000">
equally fam'd American, conduct this trial before the great tribunal of &s;ucceeding generations. And though the murderers may e&s;cape the ju&s;t re&s;entment of an emaged people, though drow&s;y ju&s;tice intoxicated by the poi&s;onous draught prepared for her cup, &s;till nods upon her rotten feat, yet be a&s;&s;ured, &s;uch complicated crimes will meet their due reward. Tell me, ye bloody butchers, ye villains high and low, ye wretches who contrived, as well as you who executed the inhuman deed, do you not feel the goads and &s;tings of con&s;cious guilt pierce through your &s;avage bo&s;oms? Though &s;ome of you may think your&s;elves exalted to a heighth that bids defiance to the arms of human ju&s;tice, and others &s;hrowd your|&s;elves beneath the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y, and build your hopes of &s;afe|ty on the low arts of cunning, chicanery and fal&s;hood; yet, do you not &s;ometimes feel the gnawings of that worm which never dies? Do not the injured &s;hades of Maverick, Gray, Caldwell, Attucks and Carr, attend you in your &s;olitary walks, arre&s;t you even in the mid&s;t of your debaucheries, and fill even your dreams with terror? But if the unappea&s;ed manes of the dead &s;hould not di&s;turb their murderers, yet &s;orely even your obdurate hearts mu&s;t &s;hrink, and your guilty blood mu&s;t chill within your rigid veins, when you behold the mi&s;erable Monk, the wretched victim of your &s;avage cruelty. Ob&s;erve his tottering knees which &s;carce &s;u&s;tain his wa&s;ted body, look on his haggard eyes, mark well the deathlike palene&s;s on his fallen cheek, and tell me, does not the &s;ight plant daggers in your &s;ouls? Unhappy Monk! Cut off in the gay morn of manhood from all the joys which &s;weeten life, doom'd to drag on a pitiful exi&s;tence without even a hope to
<PB N="12" REF="013314_0011_0F8FFB50311C0968">
ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of returning health! Yet Monk, thou live&s;t not in vain; thou live&s;t a warning to thy country which &s;ympathi&s;es with thee in thy &s;ufferings; thou live&s;t an affecting, an alarming in&s;tance of the unbounded violence which lu&s;t of power, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a &s;tanding army, can lead a traitor to commit.</P>
<P>FOR us he bled, and now langui&s;hes. The wounds by which he is tortur'd to a lingering death were aim'd at our country! &s;urely the meek-eyed charity can never behold &s;uch &s;ufferings with indif|ference. Nor can her lenient hand forbear to pour oil and wine into the&s;e wounds; and to a&s;&s;uage at lea&s;t, what it cannot heal.</P>
<P>PATRIOTISM is ever united with humanity and compa&s;&s;ion. This noble affection which impels us to &s;acrifice every thing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, even life it&s;elf, to our country, involves in it a common &s;ympathy and tenderne&s;s for every citizen, and mu&s;t ever have a <HI>particular feeling</HI> for one who &s;uffers in a publick cau&s;e. Thoroughly per&s;ua|ded of this, I need not add a word to engage your compa&s;&s;ion and bounty towards a fellow citizen, who with long protracted angui&s;h falls a victim to the relentle&s;s rage of our common enemies.</P>
<P>YE dark de&s;igning knaves, ye murderers, parricides! how dare you tread upon the earth, which has drank in the blood of &s;laughter'd innocents &s;hed by your wicked hands? How dare you breathe that air which wafted to the ear of heaven the groans of tho&s;e who fell a &s;acrifice to your accur&s;ed ambition? But if the labouring earth
<PB N="13" REF="013314_0012_0F8FFB5049001F78">
doth not expand her jaws, if the air you breathe is not commi&s;&s;ioned to be the mini&s;ter of death; yet, hear it, and tremble! the eye of Heaven penetrates the darke&s;t chambers of the &s;oul, traces the leading clue through all the labyrinths which your indu&s;trious folly has devi&s;ed; and you, however you may have &s;creen'd your&s;elves from human eyes, mu&s;t be arraigned, mu&s;t lift your hands, red with the blood of tho&s;e who&s;e death you have procur'd, at the tremendous bar of God.</P>
<P>BUT I gladly quit the gloomy theme of death, and leave you to improve the thought of that important day, when our naked Souls mu&s;t &s;tand before that Being, from whom nothing can be hid.&mdash; I would not dwell too long upon the horrid effects which have already follow'd from quartering regular troops in this town; let our mi&s;fortunes teach po&s;terity to guard again&s;t &s;uch evils for the future. Standing armies are &s;ometimes, (I would by no means &s;ay generally, much le&s;s univer&s;ally) compo&s;ed of per&s;ons who have render'd them&s;elves unfit to live in civil &s;ociety; who have no other motives of conduct than tho&s;e which a de&s;ire of the pre&s;ent gratification of their pa&s;&s;ions &s;ugge&s;ts; who have no property in any country;&mdash;Men who have lo&s;t or given up their own liberties, and envy tho&s;e who enjoy liberty; who are equally indifferent to the glory of a GEORGE or a Lewis; who for the addition of one peny a day to their wages would de&s;ert from the chri&s;tian cro&s;s, and fight under the cre&s;cent of the Turki&s;h Sultan; from &s;uch men as the&s;e, what has not a &s;tate to fear? With &s;uch as the&s;e, u&s;urping Cae&s;ar pa&s;s'd the Rubicon; with &s;uch as the&s;e he humbled mighty Rome,
<PB N="14" REF="013314_0013_0F8FFB51089259E8">
and forc'd the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world to own a ma&s;ter in a traitor. The&s;e are the men whom &s;cepter'd robbers now employ to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of God, and render vain the bounties which his gracious hand pours indi&s;criminately upon his creatures. By the&s;e the mi&s;er|able &s;laves in Turkey, Per&s;ia, and many other exten&s;ive countries, are render'd truly wretched, though their air is &s;alubrious, and their &s;oil luxuriou&s;ly fertile.&mdash;By the&s;e France and Spain, 'tho' ble&s;&s;ed by nature with all that admini&s;ters to the convenience of life, have been reduc'd to that contemptible &s;tate in which they now appear; and by the&s;e Britain &mdash; But if I was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the gift of prophecy, I dare not, except by divine command, unfold the leaves on which the de&s;tiny of that once powerful kingdom is in&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince &s;tanding armies are &s;o hurtful to a &s;tate, perhaps, my countrymen may demand &s;ome &s;ub&s;titute, &s;ome other means of ren|dering us &s;ecure again&s;t the incur&s;ions of a foreign enemy. But can you be one moment at a lo&s;s? Will not a <HI>well di&s;ciplin'd militia</HI> afford you ample &s;ecurity again&s;t foreign foes? We want not cou|rage; it is di&s;cipline alone in which we are exceeded by the mo&s;t formidable troops that ever trod the earth. Surely our hearts flutter no more at the &s;ound of war, than did tho&s;e of the immortal band of Per&s;ia, the Macedonian phalanx, the invincible Roman legions, the Turki&s;h Jani&s;&s;aries, the Gens des Armes of France, or the <HI>well known Grenadiers of Britain.</HI> A well di&s;ciplin'd militia is a &s;afe, an honourable guard to a community like this, who&s;e inhabitants are by nature brave, and are laudably tenacious of that freedom in which they were born. From a well regulated militia we have nothing to
<PB N="15" REF="013314_0014_0F90F1BAB7231108" MS="y">
fear; their intere&s;t is the &s;ame with that of the &s;tate. When a country is invaded, the militia are ready to appear in it's defence; they march into the field with that fortitude which a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e in&s;pires; they do not jeopard their lives for a ma&s;ter who con&s;iders them only as the in&s;truments of his am|bition, and whom they regard only as the daily di&s;pen&s;er of the &s;canty pittance of bread and water. No, they fight for their hou&s;es, their lands, for their wives, their children, for all who claim the tendere&s;t names, and are held deare&s;t in their hearts, they fight <HI>pro aris &amp; focis,</HI> for their liberty, and for them&s;elves, and for their God. And let it not offend if I &s;ay, that no militia ever appear'd in more flouri&s;hing condition, than that of this province now doth; and par|don me if I &s;ay,&mdash;of this town in particular.&mdash;I mean not to boa&s;t; I would not excite envy, but manly emulation. We have all one common cau&s;e; let it therefore be our only conte&s;t, who &s;hall mo&s;t contribute to the &s;ecurity of the liberties of America. And may the &s;ame kind providence which has watched over this country from her infant &s;tate, &s;till enable us to defeat our enemies. I cannot here forbear noticing the &s;ignal manner in which the de&s;igns of tho&s;e who wi&s;h not well to us have been di&s;covered. The dark deeds of a treacherous Cabal, have been brought to publick view. You now know the &s;erpents who, whil&s;t cheri&s;hed in your bo&s;oms, were darting their invenom'd &s;tings into the vitals of the con&s;titution. But the Repre&s;entatives of the people have fixed a mark on tho&s;e ungrateful mon&s;ters, which, though it may not make them &s;o &s;ecure as Cain of old, yet renders them at lea&s;t as infamous. Indeed it would be af|frontive to the tutelar deity of this country eve<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> to de&s;pair of &s;aving it from all the &s;nares which human policy can lay.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="013314_0015_0F8FFB5474F3AA00">TRUE it is, that the Briti&s;h mini&s;try have annexed a &s;alary to the office of the Governor of this province, to be paid out of a revenue rai&s;ed in America without our con&s;ent. They have attempted to render our Courts of Ju&s;tice the in&s;truments of extending the au|thority of acts of the Briti&s;h parliament over his colony, by making the Judges dependent on the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration for their &s;upport. But this people will never be en&s;laved with their eyes open. The moment they knew that the Governor was not &s;uch a Governor as the charter of the province points out, he lo&s;t his power of hurting them. They were alarmed; they &s;u&s;pected him, have guarded a|gain&s;t him, and he has found that a wi&s;e and a brave people, when they know their danger, are fruitful in expedients to e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>THE Courts of Judicature al&s;o &s;o far lo&s;t their dignity by being &s;uppo&s;ed to be under an undue influence, that our Repre&s;entatives thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Re&s;olve, that they were bound to declare that they would not receive any other &s;alary be&s;ides that which the General Court &s;hould grant them; and if they did not make this declaration, that it would be the duty of the Hou&s;e to Impeach them.</P>
<P>GREAT expectations were al&s;o formed from the artful &s;cheme of allowing the Ea&s;t India company to export Tea to America upon their own account. This certainly, had it &s;ucceeded, would have effected the purpo&s;e of the contrivers, and gratified the mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes of our adver&s;aries. We &s;oon &s;hould have found our trade in the

Much has been done by the Committees of Corre&s;pondence for the Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly in this and our Si&s;ter Colonies, for uniting the Inhabitants of the whole Continent for the &s;ecurity of their common intere&s;t. May &s;ucce&s;s ever attend their generous endeavours. But permit me here to &s;ugge&s;t a general Congre&s;s of Deputies from the &s;everal Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly on the Continent, as the mo&s;t effectual method of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch an Union as the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of our affairs requires. At &s;uch a Congre&s;s, a firm foundation may be laid for the &s;ecurity of our Rights and Liberties; a &s;y&s;tem may be form|ed for our common &s;afety, by a &s;trict adherence to which we &s;hall
