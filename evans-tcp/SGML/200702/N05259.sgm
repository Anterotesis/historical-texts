</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY are the penitent Words of <HI>David,</HI> re|flecting upon his barbarous Murder of <HI>Uriah:</HI> A mo&s;t earne&s;t Prayer to GOD to forgive his Crime, and re&s;tore the Peace of his Soul. You have the dreadful Story in II <HI>Sam.</HI> xi, <HI>&amp;</HI> xii, Chapters. After his great and complicated Wickedne&s;s, <HI>Nathan</HI> the Prophet is &s;ent to him with a Me&s;&s;age from GOD; a Me&s;&s;age full of Conviction, Re&s;entment, and Mercy. The Prophet, in the Name of GOD, charges home his Sin upon his Con&s;cience; <HI>Thou art the Man!</HI> He de|nounces the Judgments of Heaven again&s;t him, and again&s;t his Hou&s;e. He aggravates his Wickedne&s;s to him, in all its Circum&s;tances of Darkne&s;s &amp; Horror, and informs him of the mighty Anger of GOD burning and raging again&s;t him. And now the poor King has his Heart melted within him. He has nothing to &s;ay in his own Excu&s;e. He had carried on his Impiety, with Hypocri&s;y, Deceit &amp; Lies: But the Spirit of GOD &s;ei|zes him; He is overcome; He has no Heart to pro|ceed any further. <HI>And David &s;aid unto Nathan, I have
<PB N="6" REF="006647_0004_10297434D7EB94B8">
&s;inned again&s;t the Lord. And Nathan &s;aid unto David, the Lord al&s;o hath put away thy Sin; thou &s;halt not die.</HI> Here's Penitence! Here's Mercy! The weeping <HI>David</HI> at once condemns him&s;elf; owns his Guilt; falls down before GOD, in Shame and Self-loathing. But Oh! How &s;urprized was he to hear the Pardon pronounced, &s;oon as his Repentance was declared?</P>
<P>When <HI>Nathan</HI> left him, he retired to fa&s;t &amp; pray for the Life of his Child: And now, a &s;udden <HI>Afflatus</HI> from GOD came upon him, and in&s;pired he writes the P&s;alm before us. The Spirit of GOD comes back again to his Soul: and tho' perhaps he intended to make a Prayer for the Recovery of his Infant, The Words are altered in his Mouth, and in his Pen; And he gives us the mo&s;t noble Proce&s;s of Repentance that is any where to be met with. That Part of the P&s;alm that I am upon, &s;uited to the awful Occa&s;ion of this Day, is the Addre&s;s of the humble Penitent to GOD, to pardon his dreadful Mur|der: <HI>Deliver me from Blood-guiltine&s;s, O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation: and my Tongue &s;hall &s;ing aloud of thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash; In di&s;cour&s;ing on the&s;e Words, I &s;hall in the Name of GOD, endeavour the following Things.</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall de&s;cribe the <HI>Crime</HI> of <HI>David: Blood-Guiltine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I &s;hall con&s;ider his <HI>Prayer: Deliver me from Blood-Guiltine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. I &s;hall &s;tate the <HI>Argument of his Hopes: O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>And la&s;tly, His <HI>grateful Re&s;olution</HI> in Ca&s;e God for|gave him; <HI>My Tongue &s;hall &s;ing aloud of thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to be as brief as I can upon the&s;e Points, that I may ha&s;ten to that particular and &s;olemn Application, which I am call'd to by the affecting Ob|ject before us.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to de&s;cribe to you the Crime of <HI>David</HI>; ex|pre&s;s'd in that Word <HI>Blood-Guiltine&s;s.</HI> The original Word litterally tran&s;lated is <HI>Bloods&mdash;From Bloods.</HI> 'Twas an in|volved Crime, a perplex'd Piece of Villany. It had in
<PB N="7" REF="006647_0005_10297437D27D3EF0">
it a Plurality of dark Circum&s;tances &amp; Murders. <HI>Bloods:</HI> There was more than one it &s;eems in it. Perhaps when <HI>Uriah</HI> was &s;et in the Front of the Battle, it was &s;o order'd that others &s;hould fall with him to di&s;gui&s;e the Bu&s;ine&s;s. II Sam. xi.25. <HI>Then David &s;aid to the Me&s;&s;enger &mdash; The Sword devoureth one as well as another: Make the Battle &s;tronger</HI> next Time. However, <HI>Joah</HI> was guilty as well as <HI>David</HI>; and it all re&s;ted in the End upon the Head of <HI>David,</HI> who cau&s;ed <HI>Joah</HI> to &s;in. So that the Guilt of two fell upon him &s;ingly, and in this Re&s;pect, he might well &s;peak of <HI>Bloods.</HI> Be&s;ides this, the poor innocent Infant mu&s;t die for his Father's Sin; &s;o that in &s;ome Sort he was the Author of his Child's Death too. But it may be <HI>David</HI> u&s;ed the plural Number here, reflecting upon his murderous De&s;igns once or twice before: For he had the Guilt in his Heart, tho' GOD with-held him from compleating the Act. &mdash; What a Madman was he in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Nabal!</HI> 'Tis true, the Son of <HI>Belial</HI> u&s;ed him unju&s;tly and &s;curilou&s;ly: But was that any Rea&s;on that he &s;hould murder him, and his whole Family with him? Becau&s;e <HI>Nabal</HI> was a Churl, mu&s;t <HI>David</HI> turn a revengeful, bloody Ruffian? And yet what a Speech did he make upon this Occa&s;ion, when he heard <HI>Nabal</HI> had affronted him? He was all on Fire. 'Twas but a Word and a Blow with him. In an In&s;tant he flies out in a Frenzy, cur&s;es all his Enemies, profanes the Name of his GOD, and vows to kill <HI>Nabal</HI> and all his Family before Morning. 1 Sam. xxv.12. <HI>So David's young Men turned their Way, and went again, and came and told him all tho&s;e Sayings. And David &s;aid unto his Men, Gird you on every Man his Sword! and they girded on every Man his Sword, and went up after David four hundred Men. And David &s;aid. Surely in vain have I kept all that this Fellow hath in the Wilderne&s;s &mdash; And he hath requited me Evil for Good. So and more al&s;o do GOD unto the Ene|mies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the Morning Light, even &s;o much as a Dog.</HI> And did you ever hear &s;uch Language as this from the Mouth of any
<PB N="8" REF="006647_0006_1029743AD9983730">
but a bloody-minded Madman? And tho' a good GOD prevented the Execution of this ra&s;h Vow, who can ex|cu&s;e <HI>David</HI> from having Murder in his Heart? Well then might <HI>David</HI> in his Penitence, reflect upon more Murders than one, and pray to be delivered from <HI>Bloods.</HI></P>
<P>But to confine our Selves to this particular Crime, and if you plea&s;e, to keep to the Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation, <HI>Blood-guiltine&s;s:</HI> O what a Scene of Impiety opens to our View! 'Tis one of the mo&s;t di&s;mal Hi&s;tories in all the Scrip|tures. The &s;trange&s;t In&s;tance of a Fall from GOD that was ever before known. <HI>David,</HI> a poor unregardable little Shepherd, cho&s;en by the peculiar Grace of GOD, di&s;tingui&s;hed from, and advanced above all his goodly elder Brethren, pre&s;erved by a con&s;tant Series of Mira|cles, rai&s;ed to the Throne of the peculiar People of GOD, &s;urrounded by all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Earth and Heaven; in&s;pired by the va&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Holy Spirit; and in one Word, declared to be, <HI>The Man after GOD's own Heart.</HI> This <HI>David</HI> now; (would you think it!) This very <HI>David,</HI> falls into Adultery and Murder. The lea&s;t Sin, had in him been great, who was under &s;o many Obligations to GOD: But Adultery &amp; Murder! What could a Heathen, or an Athie&s;t do wor&s;e?</P>
<P>And yet this is the very Ca&s;e before us. <HI>David,</HI> un|der all his indi&s;&s;oluble Obligations, and matchle&s;s. Ad|vantages, thus fouly falls, an eternal Reproach to hu|man Nature, and an In&s;tance what frail Creatures we are, even the be&s;t Men upon Earth.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> then goes up to the Battlements of his Palace, and there walks idly from Side to Side; and having no Bu&s;ine&s;s to employ him, falls a Prey to the Temp|tations of Coveteou&s;ne&s;s and Lu&s;t. Happy had it been for thee, <HI>David,</HI> had&s;t thou now been employed in the Affairs of the Kingdom, or in thy Retirements addre&s;s'd a P&s;alm to Heaven. But he was idle! And O what an Inlet is this cur&s;ed Vice to all Mi&s;chief &amp; Wickedne&s;s? Being idle he &s;tood as it were a Man in the Devil's Mar|ket Place, waiting to be &s;et to Work. Here <HI>Satan</HI> found him out of God's Way; and this which appears to many
<PB N="9" REF="006647_0007_1029743C5F4E4840">
&s;o little a Sin, lead the Way to all the Exce&s;s and Li|centiou&s;ne&s;s following. He was tempted and he fell. The generous <HI>Uriah</HI> was now in the bloody Field, fight|ing the Battels of the Lord, &amp; maintaining the Honour of this <HI>David</HI>; while he ba&s;ely betrayed his Wife. Afraid the Matter &s;hould be di&s;covered, he u&s;es the meane&s;t Artifices, and the vile&s;t Hypocri&s;y to cover his Wicked|ne&s;s: But when he found none of his ba&s;e Schemes took Effect, then (wonder O Heavens, and be a&s;toni&s;hed O Earth, be ye horribly afraid, and be ye very de&s;olate!) then he con&s;pires the Death of <HI>Uriah,</HI> one of his brave&s;t and mo&s;t gallant Friends. He who merited to be rank|ed with the thirty Worthies, mu&s;t be ranked in the Fore|front of the Battel, that he may be numbred to the Sword of the Enemy. Was ever any Thing more treacherous and perfideous! The vile Con&s;piracy took Effect, and the brave <HI>Uriah</HI> falls a Victim to the Cruelty and Lu&s;t of <HI>David.</HI> The <HI>Adultery</HI> was dete&s;tible; But nothing could be more barbarous and cur&s;ed than the <HI>Murder.</HI> Con&s;ider the Criminal, the Manner, and the Subject, and <HI>there was no &s;uch Deed done nor &s;een from the Day that the Children of I&s;rael came out of the Land of Egypt, unto this Day: Con&s;ider of it, confer together, and &s;peak your Minds.</HI> How often mu&s;t <HI>David</HI>'s Con&s;cience check him, while he was con&s;piring this Wickedne&s;s? How many Reluctings mu&s;t he needs have within? And yet, deliberately, and bearing down all, he compleats the Guilt, and the gallant Hero bleeds a Sacrifice to his lewd De&s;ires.</P>
<P>Now <HI>David</HI> began to make him&s;elf ea&s;y. The Mur|der was committed, and he thought that it would be concealed: There could never be any Proof of the Mat|ter, and he fancied him&s;elf &s;ecure. But Oh, poor Man, thy GOD, and thy Con&s;cience know the Affair, and in vain would&s;t thou di&s;gui&s;e it from the World, while the Guilt and the Angui&s;h corrodes within. Alas! there are no more quiet Hours for <HI>David.</HI> His Heart &s;mites him, his GOD withdraws, the Gho&s;t of the murdered
<PB N="10" REF="006647_0008_1029743FB18B0778">
<HI>Uriah</HI> haunts his Dreams, and perplexes his waking Hours. He turns pale and &s;tarts at every Noi&s;e, and hears the Blood cry from the Ground, for Vengeance to the GOD of Heaven. He who a few Nights ago could fall a&s;leep in the Raptures of his Ma&s;ter's Love, now has no Re&s;t in his Bones becau&s;e of his Sin. He who was wont to remember his GOD with Joy upon his Bed, now waters his Couch with his Tears. The Angui&s;h of his Mind was in&s;upportable long before <HI>Nathan</HI> was &s;ent from GOD to him. He quickly begun to repent after the Fact was over.</P>
<P>I know 'tis the general Opinion, that <HI>David</HI> lived in his Sin, for &s;everal Months, and was never brought to Repentance 'till this Vi&s;it from <HI>Nathan.</HI> But, with all Submi&s;&s;ion, I think the Ca&s;e was much otherwi&s;e. It appears as tho' &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of the penitential P&s;alms were written after the Murder of <HI>Uriah,</HI> and before <HI>Na|than</HI> had &s;aid, <HI>The Lord al&s;o hath put away thy Sin.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 6.32.38.51.102.130.143.</NOTE> Would <HI>David,</HI> do you imagine, have written in &s;uch di&s;ponding Terms, after God him&s;elf had a&s;&s;ur'd him that he was pardoned? No: tho' this P&s;alm wherein is my Text, was written after <HI>Nathan's</HI> Me&s;&s;age, yet it &s;hould &s;eem from the different Air, that other of the pe|nitential P&s;alms were compo&s;ed in the Depth of Peni|tence, before <HI>David</HI> could per&s;wade him&s;elf that GOD had forgiven him.</P>
<P>See the poor King in his dark Retirements! Adultery and Murder lay upon his Soul. He complains of Di&s;|quietude, Wounds, and broken Bones. He weeps and rores with inward Di&s;tre&s;s. His Tears are his Meat Night and Day, and he finds no Relief as yet from GOD or Man. However, his Penitence is &s;incere, tho' he &s;ees it not. He would not commit the Wickedne&s;s again for a thou&s;and Worlds. As yet, the C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> was con|cealed from the World, and as GOD had conceal'd it, he had no need to blaze it abroad. But however, he is brought into this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Temper, as every true Peni|tent
<PB N="11" REF="006647_0009_10297442B6AFC950">
is, if ever Providence &s;hould bring it out, his Re|pentance &s;hould be as publick as his Sin. This is the true Di&s;po&s;ition of a &s;incere Convert. And now the fulne&s;s of Time was come for a merciful GOD to re|gard his Di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;end the Words of Pardon to him. The Prophet comes at the divine Order, and charges his Guilt home upon him, <HI>Thou art the Man!</HI> At once <HI>Da|vid</HI> confe&s;&s;es without He&s;itation or Reluctance. He bur&s;ts into Tears, and cries out, <HI>I have &s;inned again&s;t the Lord.</HI> Now you &s;ee <HI>David</HI> again. He appears like his former Self. Full of Faith, and Love, and Prayer, and Grati|tude, he returns to his GOD, and ri&s;es in all his Glory. <HI>Nathan</HI> goes away, and <HI>David</HI> retires to Fa&s;ting and Prayer, to a&s;k the Life of his unlawful Child. But GOD meets him in the miraculous In&s;piration, and he forgets his own particular Reque&s;t, and writes this penitential P&s;alm, for the Benefit of the Church in all future Ages.</P>
<P>We have thus con&s;idered the Crime of <HI>David,</HI> and how va&s;t was it! How dreadful in <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> and how aggravated in <HI>him!</HI> And yet, hoping in GOD, he makes this Prayer, <HI>Deliver me from Blood-guiltine&s;s, O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation: and my Tongue &s;hall &s;ing aloud of thy Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And this is the &s;econd Thing to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am to ob&s;erve upon the <HI>Prayer</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> with Regard to his dreadful Sin. He <HI>prays</HI>; and 'twas the be&s;t Thing he could do. The wi&s;e&s;t Cour&s;e we can take after we have fallen into Sin, is at once to pray for Re|pentance. If ever <HI>Satan</HI> can keep us from praying, he has us fa&s;t enough. If <HI>David</HI> had re&s;trained Prayer, af|ter his Sin, what had become of him then indeed! then he had been ruined without Hope. But he prayed to his GOD: and what &s;aid he: <HI>Deliver me from Blood-guiltine&s;s, O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation &amp;c.</HI> Deli|ver me from it. Happy had it been for <HI>David,</HI> had he made this Prayer, when he was fir&s;t tempted to it. But now 'tis pa&s;t, he is convinced, that if GOD will plea&s;e to forgive him, he may yet be delivered. The Man who is pardoned, is in the Sight of GOD, as pure as he who never &s;inned.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="006647_0010_10297448AA4BC240">III. You ob&s;erve the <HI>Argument</HI> which <HI>David</HI> makes u&s;e of in his Plea for a Pardon. <HI>O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation.</HI>&mdash; Pa&s;t Experiences are Arguments for future Favours.&mdash;The Name of GOD is his &s;trong Tower, to which he flies for Protection. His Name is the GOD of Salvation: Wherefore, for his Name's Sake, <HI>David</HI> urges for a Pardon. <HI>Thou GOD of my Salvation:</HI> 'Tis as if he had &s;aid, <HI>Thou GOD my SAVIOUR.</HI> This was the Name for the MESSIAH. And under that dark Di&s;pen&s;ation, 'twas as tho' he had &s;aid, <HI>For CHRIST's Sake.</HI> And thus are we to &s;eek Pardon from GOD. Not for the Sake of our own Prayers and Tears, and good Works: But only on the Account of our Saviour's Merits: <HI>O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation.</HI> Of his own Mercy he &s;aved us. Eph. ii.8. <HI>For by Grace are ye &s;aved, thro' Faith, &amp; that not of your &s;elves: it is the Gift of GOD.</HI> 'Tis a fatal Mi&s;take, to pray for a Pardon, and think we &s;hall obtain it for the Sake of the Prayer. Or if we endeavour to repent of Sin, &amp; reform our Lives, it over&s;ets the whole Work, if we depend upon this Repentance and Refor|mation, and not on GOD our Saviour. Rom. x.3, 4. <HI>For they being ignorant of GOD's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ub|mitted them&s;elves unto the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD. For CHRIST is the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth.</HI> Our whole Argument for a Pardon then, mu&s;t be, <HI>O GOD, Thou GOD of my Salvation.</HI> We mu&s;t depend upon the Mercies of GOD, and the Merits of our Saviour, for Pardon, and Acceptance, and Reconciliation. After all the vile Crime of <HI>David,</HI> he could make this his Confidence, and take Sanctuary here. There's no Sinner &s;o great, but here's enough for him, upon his &s;incere return.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Thing I ob&s;erv'd in the Text, was</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>David's grateful Re&s;olution</HI> in Ca&s;e GOD forgave him; and the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Effect</HI> of pardoning Mercy. <HI>My Tongue &s;hall &s;ing aloud of thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Says the Penitent <HI>David,</HI> I am under the Guilt of Bloods&mdash;But O my GOD forgive me, and my Tongue
<PB N="13" REF="006647_0011_1029744A30038100">
&s;hall &s;ing aloud of thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Prai&s;e &amp; Thank&s;|giving are the immediate Practice of every pardoned Sin|ner. O when a poor Creature has been &s;haken over the Mouth of Hell, and then &s;ees him&s;elf delivered, he is &s;wallowed up in the Love of GOD, and burns with the mo&s;t lively Gratitude to him. O, &s;ays he, what has my GOD done for me! and what &s;hall I render to him! Thou GOD of my Salvation, how can I prai&s;e thee enough! Never can I requite thee; but how &s;hall I te&s;tify the Sincerity and Ardors of my Love!</P>
<P>But in the original Text, the Particle <HI>And</HI> is omitted. It runs, <HI>Deliver me from Bloods, O GOD, Thou GOD of my Salvation;&mdash;My Tongue &s;hall &s;ing aloud of thy Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> This expre&s;&s;es the A&s;&s;urance the P&s;almi&s;t had, that GOD <HI>had</HI> heard him, and the Joy of Pardon was breaking in. It teaches us, that where-ever true Repen|tance is, there is certainly Forgivene&s;s. The <HI>Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation</HI> expre&s;&s;es the <HI>grateful Re&s;entment</HI> of a <HI>Pardon:</HI> the <HI>original Hebrew</HI> declares, the <HI>certain Effect</HI> of <HI>Re|pentance.</HI> As <HI>David</HI> prays to be delivered, he &s;tops &s;hort and &s;ays inward, <HI>I am &s;o</HI>: My Tongue <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;ing aloud of thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve; If we are pardon'd 'tis becau&s;e of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD our Saviour. This mu&s;t be im|puted to us, if ever we are forgiven by GOD. If after all our Sins, we are again received into Favour, we mu&s;t not attribute it to our own Merits, but &s;ing aloud of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve, That it is an Act of Ju&s;tice in GOD to forgive the believing Penitent. CHRIST, in a Word, has paid the full Price of a Pardon for all that repent and believe. 'Tis then a Debt upon GOD's giving us Faith and Repentance: GOD is Righteous when he receives us upon our Repentance and Faith. He may be ju&s;t, and yet ju&s;tify him that believeth. 'Tis a great Word, and if GOD had not &s;aid it him&s;elf, we &s;hould not have dar'd to; I Joh. i.9. <HI>If we confe&s;s our Sins, he is Faithful and Ju&s;t to forgive us our Sins, and to clean&s;e us from all Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Convinced of this, <HI>David</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd
<PB N="14" REF="006647_0012_1029744BC1317738">
of the divine Pardon, prepares to &s;ing aloud of the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of GOD, which fir&s;t purcha&s;ed, and then be|&s;towed it.</P>
<P>I have now gone thro' the &s;everal Points of Doctrine which I intended, and am arriv'd to my Application.</P>
<P N="1">I. From what has been &s;aid, you &s;ee into what dread|ful Sins human Nature may fall; even the be&s;t of Men, a <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf, off his Guard, and loo&s;ing his Hold of God, falls into Adultery, Per&s;idy, Ingratitude, Hypo|cri&s;y and Murder! O what Cau&s;e have we to walk cautiou&s;ly and humbly with our God.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let none venture to Sin from the Example of <HI>David.</HI> Would any &s;eek to ju&s;tify or excu&s;e their own Wickedne&s;s from this di&s;mal Hi&s;tory? Do they &s;ay, <HI>David</HI> did as bad as we can? Vain Men, is <HI>David</HI> to be imitated or no? If he is, why do you not follow him in his Repentance, his Devotion, his &s;teady and long continued Cour&s;e of Holine&s;s, as well as in one Act which he him&s;elf pronounced dete&s;table. So that, thou Hypo|crite, out of thy own Mouth &s;halt thou be condemned. But if you &s;ay he is not to be imitated, then pray never mention his Name to paliate or &s;often thy own Crimes.&mdash;'Twas one of the greate&s;t Agravations of his Sin, that it <HI>gave Occa|&s;ion to the Enemies of the Lord to Bla&s;pheme.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Let none applaud his own Innocence, when he compares him&s;elf with the Falls of <HI>David.</HI> Say not, how pure am I, who never committed &s;uch enormous Crimes? The Law &s;ays, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill, thou &s;halt not commit Adultery.</HI> Say not, <HI>The&s;e have I kept from my Youth.</HI> 'Twas the proud <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> who utter'd the pro|fane Boa&s;t, <HI>God I thank thee that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers, or even as this Pub|lican.</HI> Nay, let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth, take Heed lea&s;t he fall. Whil&s;t I have been Preaching of Adul|tery &amp; Murder, let not the bigger Part of the Audience think that they have little to do with it. Alas, in this vile Heart of mine, are the Seeds of all the&s;e blacke&s;t Sins. So &s;aid the ble&s;&s;ed Martyr <HI>Bradford,</HI> &s;triking
<PB N="15" REF="006647_0013_1029744EC74A45A0">
on his Brea&s;t; when he heard of the great Sins of others. If God &s;hould leave us to our&s;elves, there's no Sin &s;o vile but the very be&s;t of us would pre&s;ently com|mit. Nay, who can pronounce him&s;elf clear, when the LORD JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf, that be&s;t Expo&s;iter of the divine Law, has po&s;itively declared, <HI>Who&s;oever is angry at his Brother without a Cau&s;e</HI> is a <HI>Murderer: Who&s;oever looks with irregular De&s;ire</HI> is an <HI>Adulterer.</HI> Matth. v.21, 27. Nay, in the Name of God, I indict every impenitent Sinner in this great A&s;&s;embly, of Murder, mo&s;t execrable Murder! You have your Share in the Guilt that has murdered all Mankind. For <HI>as by one Man Sin enter'd into the World, and Death by Sin, &s;o has Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, in that all have &s;inned.</HI> More than this, every Time you have committed a Sin, you have given a deadly Stab to your ruin'd Spirits. He that doth it, de&s;troyeth his own Soul. When you have been about to commit Sin, how have you once and again felt your Heart mi&s;|give, your Con&s;cience &s;mite you. You were that Mo|ment going to kill your Souls: And had you attended, you had heard them cry out, MURDER! And yet, you have &s;top'd your Ears to their bitter Shreeks, and have gone on, 'till now perhaps they are wholly dead, quite in&s;en&s;ible, and the Spirit of GOD may never work upon them any more. But what &s;ay you to that Indictment of the Apo&s;tle, Heb. vi.6. <HI>If they &s;hall fall away, it is impo&s;&s;ible to renew them again unto Repentance: &s;eeing they crucify to them&s;elves the Son of GOD afre&s;h, and put him to open Shame.</HI> Or what &s;hall the profane Approacher to the Lord's Table &s;ay to that Indictment, <HI>He is guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</HI> To every impenitent Sinner, who &s;hall a&s;k, What has a Sermon to a Murderer to do with me? I tell him, as the Prophet from GOD to <HI>David, Thou art the Man.</HI> The Blood of your mur|dered Souls cries to Heaven again&s;t you. Again&s;t thy own Life ha&s;t thou done this Thing! All of us then have need enough to make the Prayer of my Text, <HI>Deliver me from Blood-guiltine&s;s, O GOD, Thou GOD of my Salvation &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="006647_0014_1029745332EA6C80">But, I come now to the more particular Application of the Day; and addre&s;s the Word of GOD to the poor Malefactor before us in the Terrors of the Shadow of Death.</P>
<P>Ah! poor Daughter of Death, Hear what Me&s;&s;ages I bring you from Heaven, and GOD give you Faith in the Hearing.</P>
<P>Poor Criminal, here you &s;tand condemned before GOD; within a few Moments of Death and Eternity. Need I &s;ay any Thing to excite <HI>your</HI> Attention to the Admonitions of Heaven. <HI>You</HI> are too nearly concern|ed to be a &s;leepy Hearer. I &s;hall &s;peak to you, as to One ju&s;t launching into the invi&s;ible World, with the utmo&s;t Fidelity to GOD, my own Soul, and yours.</P>
<P>This is not a Time to give flattering Words, but as far as I can, fir&s;t to convince, to affect, to awaken you; and then to &s;hew you the right Way to a Pardon, and encourage you to <HI>lay hold</HI> on it.</P>
<P>Ah, unhappy Malefactor! The Voice of the inno|cent Blood cries aloud from the Ground to Heaven. In many Regards my Text is &s;uited to you, and your Cir|cum&s;tances are like <HI>David's.</HI> GOD has ble&s;s'd you with a religious Education. Like <HI>David</HI> you have been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed among your Nation by peculiar Favours of GOD.</P>
<P>And now, what Improvement did you make of your Advantages? What Returns did you make to the good GOD that di&s;tingui&s;hed you? You are ready in &s;ome Sort to own how di&s;obedient &amp; fal&s;e &amp; mi&s;chievous you have been. GOD gave you a Space to repent, and tried you from Day to Day: But you repented not; you were hard and incorrigible. GOD provok'd, left you: and you &s;ee what is come of it: Young as you are, ripe for the Vengeance of a capital Execution! However, He was good to you &s;till: and in your long Confine|ment, in Darkne&s;s &amp; Solitude, he has given you Oppor|tunities to &s;eek his Favour; and GOD knows how mi&s;erably you have improved them.</P>
<P>But, O poor Malefactor, I would not drive you to De&s;pair. I bring you good Tydings of great Joy, unto
<PB N="17" REF="006647_0015_102974564F7D8BB0">
you is offer'd a Saviour; Pardon and Life &amp; Salvation. You know what the Law of GOD &s;ays expre&s;ly, Exod. xx.13. <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill.</HI> You have read what awful Words GOD &s;pake to <HI>Noah,</HI> Gen. ix.5, 6. <HI>Surely your Blood of your Lives will I require: at the Hand of every Man's Brother will I require the Life of Man. Who&s;o &s;hed|deth Man's Blood, by Man &s;hall his Blood be &s;hed.</HI> You have been told of that unalterable Sentence of Hea|ven, Numb. xxxv.16. <HI>If he &s;mite him (&s;o that he die) he is a Murderer: the Murderer &s;hall &s;urely be put to Death.</HI> Here, in the Word of GOD, you read your Crime and your Puni&s;hment. It would be a Sin in any &s;o much as to wi&s;h for your Life, Prov. xxviii.17. <HI>A Man that doth Violence to the Blood of any Per&s;on, &s;hall flee to the Pit, let no Man &s;tay him.</HI> Numb. xxxv.31. <HI>Moreover, ye &s;hall take no Satisfaction for the Life of a Murderer, which is guilty of Death: but he &s;hall, be &s;urely put to Death.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' you have lo&s;t your Life for this World, there is yet &s;ome Hope remaining that you may obtain a bet|ter. Indeed they are dreadful Words, I Joh. iii.15. <HI>No Murderer hath eternal Life.</HI> 'Tis a dreadful De&s;cription, Rev. xxii.15. Shut out of the holy City, <HI>are Dogs, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and who&s;oever loveth and maketh a Lie.</HI> 'Tis a dreadful Declaration, Gal. v.19, 21. <HI>The Works of the Fle&s;h are the&s;e, Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanne&s;s, Murders, Drunkenne&s;s &mdash; They that do &s;uch Things &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of GOD.</HI> 'Tis a dreadful Account, Rev. xxi.8. <HI>The Unbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and all Liars, &s;hall have their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone; which is the &s;econd Death.</HI> This, mi&s;erable Creature, mu&s;t be your certain Doom, if after all, you die impenient. You have fallen into the Hands of Men, and they have condemned you as not fit to live: But O you'l find it a fearful Thing to fall in|to the Hands of the living GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="006647_0016_1029745965150AC0">But yet, after all the&s;e dreadful Words, I am here, in the Name of CHRIST, to make you another Offer of a Pardon. Like <HI>Nathan,</HI> I would fir&s;t convict you: And then, like him, I am to inform you of the Mercies of GOD, and the Hopes of Forgivene&s;s. You mu&s;t be in Agony, but you may not De&s;pair. Tho' Murder is &s;uch a flagrant Crime, and the Word of GOD &s;peaks &s;o terribly of it, yet, 'tis no more than what you &s;ee <HI>David</HI> has been pardon'd for before. So was <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> who is now in Glory, after all his Wickedne&s;s &amp; Murders. He &s;hed innocent Blood very much, which the Lord would not pardon, &s;o as not to puni&s;h it in this World: No more did he <HI>David's</HI> Murder, but for ever after this was he pur&s;u'd by one Affliction after another, 'till he died: But yet <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> are both now in Paradi&s;e, ble&s;&s;ing and admiring the Grace of GOD together: You, poor Criminal, may in a few Hours be with them.</P>
<P>'Twas long before <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> repented. Not 'till he was bound with Fetters, and held in Cords of Affliction: II Chron. xxxiii.11. <HI>And when he was in Affliction he be&s;ought the Lord his God, and humbled him&s;elf greatly be|fore the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him, and he was entreated of him, and heard his Supplication: Then</HI> Mana&s;&s;eh <HI>knew that the Lord he is God.</HI> Nay, what Incouragement would you de&s;ire, di&s;con&s;olate Pri&s;oner! The very Men who murdered the Son of God, were par|doned and are now in Heaven. See <HI>Act.</HI> ii.23.36 &mdash;41.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the innocent Blood cries from the Ground for Vengeance: But yet, the Blood of Sprinkling &s;peak|eth better Things than the Bood of <HI>Abel,</HI> and this lifts up a prevailing Cry for Pardon &amp; Forgivene&s;s for you. When the frightned Jailour was going to Murder <HI>him|&s;elf,</HI> and cried out, trembling, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> The Apo&s;tle an&s;wered him, <HI>Act.</HI> xvi.31. <HI>Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> So I &s;ay to you, Pri&s;oner of Death. I &s;hall explain your Duty in this Thing, and &s;o conclude my Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="006647_0017_1029745B011538C0">Spend &s;ome of your few Moments in calling to Mind your Sins, in their &s;everal Argravations, and confe&s;s them as particularly as you can to GOD. He that covereth his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion &s;hall not pro&s;per: But he that con|fe&s;&s;eth and for&s;aketh <HI>&s;hall find Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>As you &s;ee your&s;elf thus ruin'd on all Hands, now betake your&s;elf to GOD in CHRIST. Here, poor Cri|minal, here's Mercy and plentious Redemption for you. Here's Pardon and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification &amp; eter|nal Life. Say, O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation, for thy Names Sake, and for thy Son's Sake, forgive me, and renew me. Submit to GOD your Saviour, and chu&s;e and tru&s;t in the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, as your Pro|phet, Prie&s;t and King. Renounce your own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and depend upon his. Say, <HI>Tho' he &s;lay me, yet will I tru&s;t in him.</HI> If God enables you to be &s;incere and thorough in this, there &s;hall after all be Joy in Hea|ven over you. The Prodigal returning &s;hall be met and embraced by the tender Father.</P>
<P>And now let your Tongue &s;ing aloud of his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. Plead the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of your Savi|our for your Ju&s;tification; prai&s;e and admire this: Adore the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD, who gives you up for this World; but offers you a Pardon for the next. Ju&s;tify God, and condemn your&s;elf. Submit and re&s;ign, and fall down before this &s;overeign and ju&s;t GOD. Thus &s;pend the few Moments of your Life here, and if GOD &s;hould indeed give you &s;uch a Heart, in that Hour when you leave this World, the LORD JESUS CHRIST who him&s;elf &s;uffered without the Gates, &s;hall &s;ay to you, as once to the Malefactor at his Execution. <HI>To Day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But I now turn me to this very great Congregation: And Oh! Let the chief of Sinners here before GOD, hence learn their Duty, and take Warning. Flee in|&s;tantly from the Wrath to come, the Evil which pur&s;ue Sinners.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="006647_0018_1029745F84AEF980">De&s;pair not, my Brethren, but remember <HI>David,</HI> after all his mo&s;t horrible Guilt, coming back and receiving Pardon. Sinner as thou art, look into the World of the Ble&s;&s;ed, and there &s;ee the perfected Spirit of this once enormous Offender, amid&s;t Mi&s;&s;ions of others, once fir&s;t in the Ranks of Mi&s;ery and Wickedne&s;s, but now the divine&s;t Triumphs of the Redeemer's Blood, and the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Workman&s;hip of the Sovereign Spirit. Look into the World of the Ble&s;&s;ed, I &s;ay, and the Holy Gho&s;t has taught you to repeat, I Cor. vi.9, 10, 11. <HI>Nei|ther For<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Self-Pol|luter&punc; nor Abu&s;ers of them&s;elves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, &s;hall inherit the Kingdom of GOD; and &s;uch were &s;ome of you: but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye are ju&s;tified, in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God.</HI> O Glories of my Context! <HI>Thy Mercy, O GOD! thy Loving-Kind|ne&s;s! The Multitude of thy tender Mercies!</HI></P>
<P>Like <HI>David</HI> then for&s;ake your Sins with the utmo&s;t Abhorrence; retire to plead unbounded Mercy, and lay hold on it for a Pardon. Be convinced of your Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions as he was, confe&s;s them with Freedom and Fulne&s;s, and deep Conviction: But &s;ee the Provi&s;ion which a merciful GOD has made for you, in a Sacrifice infinitely preferable to all Burnt-Offerings, in the Death of his Son for you. O unbounded Grace, that gave you this Saviour! And if he &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up freely for us all; how &s;hall he not in Him freely give us all Things? Pardon, Grace and Glory, and every good Thing?</P>
<P>O the Joys among the Ble&s;&s;ed, at the Conver&s;ion of &s;uch a Sinner as <HI>David,</HI> and as You! More than over ninety nine ju&s;t Per&s;ons who need no Repentance. With how much Affection will your heavenly Father run out to meet you; and in Embraces and Ki&s;&s;es, proclaim, <HI>This my Son was dead and is alive, was lo&s;t and is found.</HI></P>
