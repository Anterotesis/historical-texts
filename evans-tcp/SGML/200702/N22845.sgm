Tho&s;e, who can recollect the war that exi&s;ted between France and England fifty years ago, may figure to them&s;elves the unhappy &s;ituation of the inhabitants on the frontiers of Newhamp|&s;hire; the malice of the French in Canada, and the exa&s;perated &s;avages that dwelt in their vicinity, rendered the tedious days and frightful nights a &s;ea&s;on of unequalled calamities. The daily reports of captured families and &s;laughtered friends, mingled grief with fear. Had there been an or|ganized

government, to &s;tretch forth its protecting arm, in any ca&s;e of danger, the mi&s;ery might have been in a degree allevi|ated. But the infancy of our country did not admit of this ble&s;&s;ing. While Gov|ernor Shirley of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, was peti|tioning to England for a fleet and an ar|my, Benning Wentworth the &s;upine Gov|ernor of Newhamp&s;hire, obeyed implicit|ly the advice of his friend Shirley, and remained inactively &s;ecure at his &s;eat at Port&s;mouth. At the commencement of the year &s;eventeen hundred and forty five, the Quixotick expedition to Loui&s;burg was projected, the &s;ucce&s;s of which origin|ated from the mere&s;t accident, rather than from military valor or general&s;hip; this drained the thinly inhabited &s;tate of New|hamp&s;hire of mo&s;t of its effective men. From that period till the peace, which took place in the year &s;eventeen hundred and forty nine, the vi&s;ionary &s;chemes of

Shirley kept the be&s;t &s;oldiers embodied in &s;ome remote place, as a force to execute &s;ome impolitick project. The conque&s;t of Canada, and the attack upon Crown|point, are recorded as &s;pecimens of the wild projects which were to employ the in|fant forces of Newengland. During this time, the frontiers &s;u&s;tained additional mi&s;|eries, by having the &s;mall forces of the &s;tate deducted for purpo&s;es which could be of no immediate &s;ervice to them. The &s;avages committed frequent depredations on the defencele&s;s inhabitants, and the ea&s;e with which they gained their prey, encouraged their boldne&s;s, and by &s;catter|ing in &s;mall parties, they were able to in|fe&s;t the whole frontier of Newhamp&s;hire, from fort Dummer on Connecticut River, to the lowe&s;t &s;ettlement on Merrimack. During this war, which is known by the name of the Cape Breton war, the town of No. 4 could hardly be &s;aid to be inhab|ited;

&s;ome adventurers had made a begin|ning, but few were con&s;idered as belong|ing to the town. Capt. Stevens, who&s;e valor is recorded as an in&s;tance of con&s;ummate general&s;hip, part of the time kept the fort, which afforded a &s;helter to the enterprizing &s;ettlers, in times of imminent danger. But even his vigilance did not &s;ave the town from numerous &s;cenes of carnage. At the commencement of the peace, in &s;even|teen hundred and forty nine, the enter|prizing &s;pirit of Newengland ro&s;e &s;uperior to the dangers of the fore&s;t, and they be|gan to venture innovation. The Indians, &s;till thir&s;ty for plunder and rapine, and regardle&s;s of the peace which their ma&s;ters, the French, had concluded, kept up a fly|ing warfare, and committed &s;everal out|rages upon lives and property; this kept the increa&s;ing inhabitants in a &s;tate of alarm, for three or four years; mo&s;t of the time, they performed their

<P>OUR country has &s;o long been expo&s;ed to Indian wars, that recitals of exploits and &s;ufferings, of e&s;capes and deliverances, have become both numerous and trite. The air of novelty will not be attempted in the following pages; &s;imple facts, un|adorned, is what the reader mu&s;t expect; pity for my &s;ufferings, and admiration at my &s;afe return, is all that my hi&s;tory can excite. The aged man, while peru&s;ing, will probably turn his attention to the period when the facts took place, his memory will be refre&s;hed with the &s;ad tidings of his country's &s;ufferings, which gave a daily wound to his feelings, between the years forty and &s;ixty; by contra&s;ting tho&s;e days with the pre&s;ent, he may rejoice, that he witne&s;&s;es tho&s;e times, which many have "waited for, but died without a &s;ight."

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Removal to <HI>No. 4,</HI> in the year &s;even|teen hundred and fifty, and &s;ituation till Augu&s;t the <HI>31</HI>&s;t, the day after our Cap|tivity.</HEAD>
<P>THE continuation of peace, began by degrees to appea&s;e the re&s;ent|ment of the Indians, and they appeared to di&s;cover a wi&s;h for friendly intercour&s;e. The inhabitants in No. 4, and its vicinity, relaxed their watchfulne&s;s, and ventured more boldly into their fields. As pro&s;|pects grew favorable, my hu&s;band, Mr. James John&s;on, was induced, in the year 1750, to remove his family from Lunenburgh, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, to his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in No. 4. Le&s;t &s;avage caprice might offer &s;ome in&s;ult, we re&s;ided in the

fort the two or three fir&s;t years, but every appearance of ho&s;tility at length vani&s;hed &mdash;the Indians expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to traf|fick, the inhabitants laid by their fears, and thought no more of tomahawks, nor &s;calpingknives. Mr. John&s;on now thought him&s;elf ju&s;tified in removing to his farm, an hundred rods di&s;tant from the fort, which was then the uppermo&s;t &s;ettlement on Connecticut River, he pur|&s;ued his occupation of trade, and the In|dians made frequent vi&s;its to traffick their furs for his merchandize. He frequently credited them for blankets and other nec|e&s;&s;aries, and in mo&s;t in&s;tances they were punctual in payment. During the year 1753, all was harmony and &s;afety&mdash;&s;et|tlements increa&s;ed with tolerable rapidity, and the new country began to a&s;&s;ume the appearance of cultivation.</P>
<P>THE commencement of the year 1754 began to threaten another rupture be|tween
<PB N="12" REF="030180_0012_0FE4C1ACB7FED6C0">
the French and Engli&s;h, and as the dividing line between Canada and the Engli&s;h Colonies was the object of conten|tion, it was readily &s;een that the frontier towns would be in imminent danger. But as immediate war was not expected, Mr, John&s;on thought that he might ri&s;k the &s;afety of his family, while he made a tour to Connecticut, for trade. He &s;at out the la&s;t of May, and his ab&s;ence of three months was a tedious and a bitter &s;ea&s;on to me. Soon after his departure every body was "tremblingly alive" with fear. The Indians were reported to be on their march for our de&s;truction, and our di&s;|tance from &s;ources of information gave full latitude for exaggeration of news, before it reached our ears. The fears of the night were horrible beyond de&s;cription, and even the light of day was far from di&s;|pelling painful anxiety. While looking from the windows of my log hou&s;e, and
<PB N="13" REF="030180_0013_0FE4C1B2CA2AEBA8">
&s;eeing my neighbors tread cautiou&s;ly by each hedge and hillock, left &s;ome &s;ecreted &s;avage might &s;tart forth to take their &s;calp, my fears would baffle de&s;cription. Alarms grew louder and louder, till our apprehen|&s;ions were too &s;trongly confirmed, by the news of the capture of Mr. Malony's fam|ily, on Merrimack River; this reached us about the twentieth of Augu&s;t. Imagination now &s;aw and heard a thou&s;and Indians; and I never went round my own hou&s;e, without fir&s;t looking with trembling cau|tion by each corner, to &s;ee if a tomahawk was not rai&s;ed for my de&s;truction.</P>
<P>ON the twenty fourth of Augu&s;t I was re|lieved from all my fears by the arrival of my hu&s;band. He brought intelligence from Connecticut that a war was expected the next &s;pring, but that no immediate danger was contemplated. He had made prepa|rations to remove to Northfield, as &s;oon as
<PB N="14" REF="030180_0014_0FE4C1B48BE97428">
our &s;tock of hay was con&s;umed, and our dozen of &s;wine had demoli&s;hed our ample &s;tores of grain, which would &s;ecure his family and property from the mi&s;eries and ravages of war. Our elde&s;t &s;on, Sylvanus, who was &s;ix years old, was in the mean time to be put to &s;chool at Springfield.&mdash; Mr. John&s;on brought home a large addi|tion to his &s;tores, and the neighbors made frequent parties at our hou&s;e, to ex|pre&s;s their joy for his return, and time pa&s;&s;ed merrily off, by the aid of &s;pirit and a ripe yard of melons. As I was in the la&s;t days of pregnancy, I could not join &s;o heartily in their good cheer as I other|wi&s;e might. Yet in a new country, plea&s;|ure is often derived from &s;ources unknown to tho&s;e le&s;s accu&s;tomed to the woods. The return of my hu&s;band, the relief from danger, and the crowds of happy friends, combined to render my &s;ituation peculiar|ly agreeable. I now boa&s;ted with exulta|tion,
<PB N="15" REF="030180_0015_0FE4C1B613798CC8">
that I &s;hould, with hu&s;band, friends, and luxuries, live happy in &s;pite of the fear of &s;avages.</P>
<P>ON the evening of the twenty ninth of Augu&s;t our hou&s;e was vi&s;ited by a party of neighbors, who &s;pent the time very cheerfully with watermelons and flip, till midnight; they all then retired in high &s;pirits, except a &s;pruce young &s;park, who tarried to keep company with my &s;i&s;ter. We then went to bed with feelings well tuned for &s;leep, and re&s;ted with fine com|po&s;ure, till midway between daybreak and &s;unri&s;e, when we were rou&s;ed by neighbor Labarree's knocking at the door, who had &s;houldered his ax to do a day's work for my hu&s;band. Mr. John&s;on &s;lipped on his jacket and trow&s;ers, and &s;tepped to the door to let him in. But by opening the door he opened a &s;cene&mdash;terrible to de|&s;cribe!! Indians! Indians were the

fir&s;t words I heard, he &s;prang to his guns, but Labarree, heedle&s;s of danger, in&s;tead of clo&s;ing the door to keep them out, be|gan to rally our hired men up &s;tairs, for not ri&s;ing earlier. But in an in&s;tant a crowd of &s;avages, fixed horribly for war, ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly in. I &s;creamed and begged my friends to a&s;k for quarter; by this time they were all over the hou&s;e, &s;ome up &s;tairs, &s;ome haling my &s;i&s;ter out of bed, another had hold of me, and one was ap|proaching Mr. John&s;on, who &s;tood in the middle of the floor to deliver him&s;elf up; but the Indian, &s;uppo&s;ing that he would make re&s;i&s;tance, and be more than his match, went to the door and brought three of his comrades, and the four bound him. I was led to the door, fainting and trem|bling; there &s;tood my friend Labarree, bound; Ebenezer Farn&s;worth, whom they found up chamber, they were putting in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and to complete the &s;hock|ing
<PB N="17" REF="030180_0017_0FE4C1BF8A618438">
&s;cene, my three little children were driven naked to the place where I &s;tood. On viewing my&s;elf I found that I too was naked. An Indian had plundered three gowns, who, on &s;eeing my &s;ituation, gave me the whole. I a&s;ked another for a petticoat, but he refu&s;ed it. After what little plunder their hurry would allow them to get, was confu&s;edly bundled up, we were ordered to march. After going about twenty rods we fell behind a ri&s;ing ground, where we halted to pack the things in a better manner; while there, a &s;avage went back, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, to fire the buildings. Farn&s;worth propo&s;ed to my hu&s;band to go back with him, to get a quantity of pork from the cellar, to help us on our journey; but Mr. John&s;on prudently replied, that by that means, the Indians might find the rum, and in a fit of intoxication kill us all. The Indian pre&s;|ently returned with marks of fear in his

countenance,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, as we afterwards found, was occa&s;ioned by his meeting Mr. O&s;mer at the door of the hou&s;e, who lodged in the chamber, and had &s;ecreted him|&s;elf behind a box, and was then making his e&s;|cape. He run directly to the fort, and the alarm guns were fired. My father, Mr. James Willard, was then &s;econd in command. Captain Stevens was for &s;allying out with a party for our relief; but my father begged him to de&s;i&s;t, as the Indians made it an invari|able practice to kill their pri&s;oners when attacked.</NOTE> and we were hurried on with all violence. Two &s;avages laid hold of each of my arms, and hurried me through thorny thickets in a mo&s;t unmer|ciful manner. I lo&s;t a &s;hoe and &s;uffered exceedingly. We heard the alarm guns from the fort. This added new &s;peed to the flight of the &s;avages.&mdash;They were ap|prehen&s;ive that &s;oldiers might be &s;ent for our relief. When we had got a mile and a half, my faintne&s;s obliged me to &s;it. This being ob&s;erved by an Indian, he drew his knife, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, to put an end to my
<PB N="19" REF="030180_0019_0FE4C1C29EC618F8">
exi&s;tence. But he only cut &s;ome bands, with which my gown was tied, and then pu&s;hed me on. My little children were crying, my hu&s;band and the other two men were bound, and my &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf were obliged to make the be&s;t of our way, with all our might. The lo&s;s of my &s;hoe rendered travelling extremely painful. At the di&s;tance of three miles there was a general halt; the &s;avages, &s;up|po&s;ing that we, as well as them&s;elves, might have an appetite for breakfa&s;t, gave us a loaf of bread, &s;ome rai&s;ins and apples, which they had taken from the hou&s;e. While we were forcing down our &s;canty breakfa&s;t, a hor&s;e came in &s;ight, known to us all by the name of Scoggin, belonging to Phineas Stevens, E&s;quire. One of the Indians attempted to &s;hoot him, but was prevented by Mr. John&s;on. They then expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to catch him, &s;aying, by pointing to me, for &s;quaw to ride; my

hu&s;band had previou&s;ly been unbound to a&s;&s;i&s;t the children, he, with two Indians, caught the hor&s;e on the banks of the river. By this time my legs and feet were cover|ed with blood, which being noticed by Mr. Labarree, he, with that humanity which never for&s;ook him, took his own &s;tockings and pre&s;ented them to me, and the Indians gave me a pair of mogga&s;ons. Bags and blankets were thrown over Scoggin, and I mounted on the top of them, and on we jogged about &s;even miles, to the upper end of Wilcott's I&s;land. We there halted, and prepared to cro&s;s the river; rafts were made of dry timber&mdash;two Indians and Farn&s;worth cro&s;&s;ed fir&s;t, Labarree, by &s;igns, got permi&s;&s;ion to &s;wim the hor&s;e, and Mr. John&s;on was allowed to &s;wim by the raft that I was on, to pu&s;h it along. We all arrived &s;afe on the other &s;ide of the river, about four o'clock in the after|noon; a fire was kindled and &s;ome of

their &s;tolen kettles were hung over it, and filled with porridge. The &s;avages took delight in viewing their &s;poil, which a|mounted to forty or fifty pounds in value. They then, with a true &s;avage yell, gave the war whoop, and bid defiance to dan|ger. As our tarry in this place la&s;ted an hour, I had time to reflect on our mi&s;era|ble &s;ituation.&mdash;Captives, in the power of unmerciful &s;avages, without provi&s;ion, and almo&s;t without clothes, in a wilderne&s;s where we mu&s;t &s;ojourn as long as the children of I&s;rael did, for ought we knew, and what added to our di&s;tre&s;s, not one of our &s;avage ma&s;ters could under&s;tand a word of Engli&s;h. Here, after being hurried from home with &s;uch rapidity, I have lei|&s;ure to inform the reader, re&s;pecting our Indian ma&s;ters. They were eleven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Labarree is very po&s;itive, and I think Mr. John&s;on was of the &s;ame opinion, that &s;even|teen Indians attacked the hou&s;e; the other &s;ix might have been a &s;couting party, that watched till we were out of danger, and then took another rout.</NOTE> in

number, men of middle age, except one, a youth of &s;ixteen, who in our journey, di&s;|covered a very mi&s;chievous and trouble|&s;ome di&s;po&s;ition. According to their na|tional practice, he who fir&s;t laid hands on a pri&s;oner con&s;idered him as his prop|erty. My ma&s;ter, who was the one that took my hand when I &s;at on the bed, was as clever an Indian as ever I &s;aw, he even evinced, at numerous times, a di&s;po|&s;ition, that &s;hewed he was by no means void of compa&s;&s;ion. The four, who took my hu&s;band, claimed him as their property, and my &s;i&s;ter, three children, Labarree and Farn&s;worth, had each a ma&s;ter. When the time came for us to prepare to march, I almo&s;t expired at the thought. To leave my aged parents, brothers, &s;i&s;ters

and friends, and travel with &s;avages, through a di&s;mal fore&s;t to unknown re|gions, in the alarming &s;ituation I then was in, with three &s;mall children, the elde&s;t, Sylvanus, who was but &s;ix years old. My elde&s;t daughter, Su&s;anna, was four, and Polly, the other, two. My &s;i&s;ter Miriam was fourteen. My hu&s;band was barefoot, and otherwi&s;e thinly clothed, his ma&s;ter had taken his jacket, and nothing but his &s;hirt and trow&s;ers remained. My two daughters had nothing but their &s;hifts, and I only the gown that was handed me by the &s;avages. In addition to the &s;ufferings which aro&s;e from my own deplorable con|dition, I could not but feel for my friend Labarree; he had left a wife and four &s;mall children behind, to lament his lo&s;s, and to render his &s;ituation extremely un|happy. With all the&s;e mi&s;fortunes ly|ing heavily upon me, the reader can imag|ine my &s;ituation.&mdash;The Indians pronounc|ed

the dreadful word "munch," march, and on we mu&s;t go. I was put on the hor&s;e, Mr. John&s;on took one daughter, and Mr. Labarree, being unbound, took the other; we went &s;ix or eight miles, and &s;topped for the night. The men were made &s;ecure, by having their legs put in &s;plit &s;ticks, &s;omewhat like &s;tocks, and tied with cords, which were tied to the limbs of trees too high to be reached. My &s;i&s;ter, much to her mortification, mu&s;t lie between two Indians, with a cord thrown over her, and pa&s;&s;ing under each of them; the little children had blankets, and I was allowed one for my u&s;e. Thus we took lodging for the night, with the &s;ky for a covering, and the ground for a pillow. The fatigues of the preceding day obliged me to &s;leep &s;everal hours, in &s;pite of the horrors which &s;urrounded me.

<P>IN the morning we were rou&s;ed before &s;unri&s;e, the Indians &s;truck up a fire, hung on their &s;tolen kettles, and made us &s;ome water gruel for breakfa&s;t.

My two fellow pri&s;|oners took the little girls, and we marched &s;orrowfully on for an hour or two, when a keener di&s;tre&s;s was added to my multi|plied afflictions;&mdash;I was taken with the pangs of childbirth. The Indians &s;igni|fied to us that we mu&s;t go on to a brook. When we got there, they &s;hewed &s;ome hu|manity,
<PB N="27" REF="030180_0027_0FE4C1DA31C30768">
by making a booth for me. Here the compa&s;&s;ionate reader will drop a fre&s;h tear, for my inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;tre&s;s; fifteen or twenty miles from the abode of any civilized being, in the open wilderne&s;s, rendered cold by a rainy day&mdash;in one of the mo&s;t perilous hours, and un&s;upplied with the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, that could yield convenience in the hazardous moment. My children were crying at a di&s;tance, where they were held by their ma&s;ters, and only my hu&s;band and &s;i&s;ter to attend me; none but mothers can figure to them|&s;elves my unhappy fortune. The Indians kept aloof the whole time. About ten o'clock a daughter was born. They then brought me &s;ome articles of clothing for the child, which they had taken from the hou&s;e. My ma&s;ter looked into the booth, and clapped his hands with joy, crying two monies for me, two monies for me. I was permitted to re&s;t the remainder of
<PB N="28" REF="030180_0028_0FE4C1DBB6CA2B38">
the day. The Indians were employed in making a bier for the pri&s;oners to carry me on, and another booth for my lodging during night. They brought a needle and two pins, and &s;ome bark to tie the child's clothes, which they gave my &s;i&s;ter, and a large wooden &s;poon to feed it with; at du&s;k they made &s;ome porridge, and brought a cup to &s;teep &s;ome roots in, which Mr. Labarree had provided. In the evening I was removed to the new booth. For &s;upper, they made more porridge and &s;ome Johnny cakes. My portion was brought me in a little bark. I &s;lept that night far beyond expectation.</P>
<P>IN the morning we were &s;ummoned for the journey, after the u&s;ual breakfa&s;t, of meal and water. I, with my infant in my arms, was laid on the litter, which was &s;upport|ed alternately by Mr. John&s;on, Labarree and Farn&s;worth. My &s;i&s;ter and &s;on were
<PB N="29" REF="030180_0029_0FE4C1E1B135A800">
put upon Scoggin, and the two little girls rode on their ma&s;ters' backs. Thus we proceeded two miles, when my carriers grew too faint to proceed any further. This being ob&s;erved by our &s;able ma&s;ters, a general halt was called, and they em|bodied them&s;elves for council. My ma&s;|ter &s;oon made &s;igns to Mr. John&s;on, that if I could ride on the hor&s;e I might pro|ceed, otherwi&s;e I mu&s;t be left behind. Here I ob&s;erved marks of pity in his coun|tenance, but this might ari&s;e from the fear of loo&s;ing his two monies. I preferred an attempt to ride on the hor&s;e, rather than to peri&s;h mi&s;erably alone. Mr. Lab|arree took the infant, and every &s;tep of the hor&s;e almo&s;t deprived me of life. My weak and helple&s;s condition rendered me, in a degree, in&s;en&s;ible to every thing; my poor child could have no &s;u&s;tenance from my brea&s;t, and was &s;upported entirely by water gruel. My other little children,
<PB N="30" REF="030180_0030_0FE4C1E3359A7150">
rendered peevi&s;h by an unea&s;y mode of riding, often bur&s;t into cries, but a &s;urly check from their ma&s;ters &s;oon &s;ilenced them.&mdash;We proceeded on with a &s;low, mournful pace. My weakne&s;s was too &s;evere to allow me to &s;it on the hor&s;e, long at a time; every hour I was taken off, and laid on the ground to re&s;t. This pre&s;erved my life, during the third day. At night we found our&s;elves at the head of Black River Pond. Here we prepared to &s;pend the night, our &s;upper con&s;i&s;t|ed of gruel and the broth of a hawk, they had killed the preceding day. The pri&s;|oners were &s;ecured, as u&s;ual, a booth was made for me, and all went to re&s;t. After encampment, we entered into a &s;hort con|ver&s;ation. My &s;i&s;ter ob&s;erved, that if I could have been left behind, our trouble would have been &s;eemingly nothing. My hu&s;band hoped, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Provi|dence, we &s;hould all be pre&s;erved. Mr.
<PB N="31" REF="030180_0031_0FE4C1E4BA88A650">
Labarree pitied his poor family&mdash;and Farn&s;worth, &s;ummed the whole of his wi&s;hes, by &s;aying, that if he could have got a layer of pork, from the cellar, we &s;hould not be in fear of &s;tarvation. The night was uncommonly dark, and pa&s;&s;ed tedi|ou&s;ly off.</P>
<P>IN the morning, half chilled with a cold fog, we were ordered from our places of re&s;t, were offered the lean fare of meal and water, and then prepared for the journey; every thing re&s;embled a fu|neral proce&s;&s;ion. The &s;avages pre&s;erved their gloomy &s;adne&s;s&mdash;the pri&s;oners, bowed down with grief and fatigue, felt little di&s;|po&s;ition to talk; and the unevenne&s;s of the country, &s;ometimes lying in miry plains, at others ri&s;ing into &s;teep and broken hills, rendered our pa&s;&s;age hazard|ous and painful. Mr. Labarree kept the infant in his arms, and pre&s;erved its life.
<PB N="32" REF="030180_0032_0FE4C1E748DCE7D8">
The fifth day's journey was an unvaried &s;cene of fatigue. The Indians &s;ent out too or three hunting parties, who returned without game. As we had in the morn|ing con&s;umed the la&s;t mor&s;el of our meal, every one now began to be &s;eriou&s;ly alarm|ed; and hunger, with all its horrors, looked us earne&s;tly in the face. At night, we found the waters that run into Lake Champlain, which was over the height of land; before dark we halted, and the In|dians, by the help of their punk, which they carried in horns, made a fire. They &s;oon adopted a plan to relieve their hun|ger. The hor&s;e was &s;hot, and his fle&s;h was in a few moments broiling on embers, and they, with native gluttony, &s;atiated their craving appetites. To u&s;e the term politene&s;s, in the management of this re|pa&s;t, may be thought a burle&s;que, yet their offering the pri&s;oners the be&s;t parts of the hor&s;e, certainly bordered on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">;
<PB N="33" REF="030180_0033_0FE4C1ED5DC523B8">
an epicure could not have cartered nicer &s;lices, nor in that &s;ituation, &s;erved them up with more neatne&s;s. Appetite is &s;aid to be the be&s;t &s;auce, yet our abun|dance of it did not render &s;avory this nov|el &s;teak. My children, however, eat too much, which made them very unwell for a number of days. Broth was made for me and my child, which was rendered al|mo&s;t a luxury by the &s;ea&s;oning of roots. After &s;upper, countenances began to brighten, tho&s;e who had reli&s;hed the meal, exhibited new &s;trength, and tho&s;e who had only &s;nuffed its effluvia, confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves regaled; the evening was em|ployed in drying and &s;moking what re|mained, for future u&s;e. The night was a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fears to me, and my ex|treme weakne&s;s had affected my mind to &s;uch a degree, that every difficulty ap|peared doubly terrible. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Scoggin, I had been brought &s;o far, yet
<PB N="34" REF="030180_0034_0FE4C1EF20CFB050">
&s;o great was my debility, that every hour I was taken off, and laid on the ground, to keep me from expiring. But now alas! this conveyance was no more. To walk was impo&s;&s;ible. Inevitable death, in the mid&s;t of woods, one hundred miles wide, appeared my only portion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Continuation&mdash;till our arrival at Ea&s;t Bay, in Lake Champlain.</HEAD>
<P>IN the morning of the &s;ixth day, the Indians exerted them&s;elves to prepare one of their greate&s;t dainties. The mar|row bones of old Scoggin were pounded for a &s;oup, and every root, both &s;weet and bitter, that the woods afforded, was thrown in to give it a flavor. Each one partook of as much as his feelings would allow. The war whoop then re&s;ounded, with an infernal yell, and we began to fix for a march. My fate was unknown, till my ma&s;ter brought &s;ome bark, and tied my petticoats, as high as he &s;uppo&s;ed would be convenient for walking, and ordered me to "munch." With &s;carce &s;trength
<PB N="36" REF="030180_0036_0FE4C1F332EFD350">
to &s;tand alone, I went on half a mile, with my little &s;on and three Indians. The re&s;t were advanced. My power to move then failed, the world grew dark, and I drop|ped down. I had &s;ight enough to &s;ee an Indian lift his hatchet over my head, while my little &s;on &s;creamed, "Ma'am do go, for they will kill you." As I fainted, my la&s;t thought was, that I &s;hould pre&s;ently be in the world of &s;pirits.&mdash;When I awoke, my ma&s;ter was talking angrily with the &s;avage, who had threatened my life. By his ge&s;tures I could learn, that he charged him with not acting the honora|ble part of a warrior, by an attempt to de|&s;troy the prize of a brother. A whoop was given, for a halt. My ma&s;ter help|ed me to the re&s;t of the company&mdash;where a council was held, the re&s;ult of which was, that my hu&s;band &s;hould walk by my &s;ide, and help me along. This he did for &s;ome hours, but faintne&s;s then overpower|ed
<PB N="37" REF="030180_0037_0FE4C1F7E27B4D10">
me, and Mr. John&s;on's tenderne&s;s and &s;olicitude, was unequal to the ta&s;k, of aid|ing me further; another council was held &mdash;while in debate, as I lay on the ground, ga&s;ping for breath, my ma&s;ter &s;prang to|wards me, with his hatchet. My hu&s;band and fellow pri&s;oners grew pale at the &s;ight, &s;u&s;pecting that he, by a &s;ingle blow, would rid them&s;elves of &s;o great a burthen, as my&s;elf. But he had yet too much e|&s;teem for his "two monies." His ob|ject was to get bark from a tree, to make a pack &s;addle, for my conveyance on the back of my hu&s;band. He took me up, and we marched in that form the re&s;t of the day. Mr. Labarree &s;till kept my infant, Farn&s;worth carried one of the little girls, and the other rode with her ma&s;ter; they were extremely &s;ick and weak, owing to the large portion of the hor&s;e, which they eat; but if they uttered a murmuring word, a menacing frown
<PB N="38" REF="030180_0038_0FE4C1FA765CCB38">
from the &s;avages, &s;oon impo&s;ed &s;ilence. None of the Indians were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew in&s;ults of any nature, except the younge&s;t, which I have before mentioned. He often delighted him&s;elf, by torment|ing my &s;i&s;ter, by pulling her hair, treading on her gown, and numerous other boyi&s;h pranks, which were provoking and trouble|&s;ome. We moved on, faint and wearily, till night; the Indians, then yelled their war whoop, built a fire, and hung over their hor&s;e broth. After &s;upper, my booth was built, as u&s;ual, and I repo&s;ed much better than I had the preceding nights.</P>
<P>IN the morning, I found my&s;elf great|ly re&s;tored. Without the aid of phy&s;i|cians, or phy&s;ick, nature had began the cure of that weakne&s;s, to which &s;he had reduced me, but a few days before. The reader will be tired of the repetition of the &s;ame materials, for our meals; but if my
<PB N="39" REF="030180_0039_0FE4C1FC00E1FF78">
feelings can be realized, no one will turn with di&s;gu&s;t from a breakfa&s;t of &s;teaks, which were cut from the thigh of a hor&s;e. After which, Mr. John&s;on was ordered to take the infant, and go forward with part of the company. I "munched" in the rear till we came to a beaver pond, which was formed in a branch of Otter Creek. Here I was obliged to wade; when half way over, up to the middle in cold water, my little &s;trength failed, and my power to &s;peak or &s;ee left me. While motionle&s;s and &s;tiffened, in the middle of the pond, I was perceived from the other &s;ide, by Mr. John&s;on, who laid down the infant, and came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he took me in his arms, and when the oppo&s;ite &s;ide was gained, life it&s;elf had apparently for&s;aken me. The whole company &s;topped, and the Indians, with more humanity than I &s;uppo&s;ed them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, bu&s;ied them|&s;elves in making a fire, to warm me into
<PB N="40" REF="030180_0040_0FE4C1FE8CDC6F48">
life. The warm influence of the fire re|&s;tored my exhau&s;ted &s;trength, by degrees; and in two hours I was told to munch. The re&s;t of the day I was carried by my hu&s;band. In the middle of the afternoon, we arrived on the banks of one of the great branches of Otter Creek. Here we halted, and two &s;avages, who had been on a hunting &s;cout, returned with a duck; a fire was made, which was thrice grateful to my cold &s;hivering limbs. Six days had now almo&s;t elap&s;ed, &s;ince the fatal morn, in which we were taken, and by the ble&s;&s;|ing of that Providence, who&s;e &s;miles give life to creation, we were &s;till in exi&s;tence. My wearied hu&s;band, naked children, and helple&s;s infant, formed a &s;cene, that conveyed &s;everer pangs to my heart, than all the &s;ufferings I endured my&s;elf. The Indians were &s;ullen and &s;ilent, the pri&s;on|ers were &s;wollen with gloomy grief, and I was half the time expiring. After my
<PB N="41" REF="030180_0041_0FE4C204514C8B08">
feelings were a little quickened by warmth, my &s;ad portion was brought in a bark, con&s;i&s;ting of the Duck's head, and a gill of broth. As I lifted the un&s;avory mor|&s;el, with a trembling hand, to my mouth, I ca&s;t my thoughts back a few days, to a time, when, from a board plentifully &s;pread, in my own hou&s;e, I eat my food with a merry heart. The wooden &s;poon dropped from my feeble hand. The con|tra&s;t was too affecting. Seated on a rag|ged rock, beneath a hemlock, as I then was. Emaciated by &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;ur|rounded by my weeping and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family, who were helple&s;s pri&s;oners, de|&s;pair would have robbed me of life, had I not put my whole confidence in that Being, who has power to &s;ave. Our ma&s;ters be|gan to prepare to ford the &s;tream. I &s;wallowed mo&s;t of my broth, and was tak|en up by my hu&s;band. The river was very rapid, and pa&s;&s;ing dangerous. Mr.

Labarree, when half over with my child, was tripped up by its rapidity, and lo&s;t the babe in the water; little did I expect to &s;ee the poor thing again, but he fortunate|ly reached a corner of its blanket, and &s;aved its life. The re&s;t got &s;afe to the other &s;hore&mdash;another fire was built, and my &s;i&s;ter dried the infant, and its clothes. Here we found a proof of Indian &s;agacity, which might ju&s;tly be &s;uppe&s;ed not to be|long to a band of rambling barbarians. In their journey over to Connecticut Riv|er, they had, in this place, killed a Bear. The entrails were clean&s;ed, and filled with the fat of the animal, and &s;u&s;pended from the limb of a tree; by it was depo&s;ited a bag of flour, and &s;ome tobacco, all which was de&s;igned for future &s;tores, when trav|elling that way. Nothing could have been offered more acceptable, than the&s;e tokens of Indian economy and prudence. The flour was made into pudding, and
<PB N="43" REF="030180_0043_0FE4C208AEE3BD08">
the bear grea&s;e &s;auce was not unreli&s;hing. Broth was made, and well &s;ea&s;oned with &s;nakeroot, and tho&s;e who were fond of tobacco, had each their &s;hare. The whole, formed quite a &s;umptuous entertainment. But the&s;e &s;avage dainties, made no &s;en&s;i|ble addition to our quota of happine&s;s. My weakne&s;s increa&s;ed, my children were very unwell, and Mr. John&s;on's &s;ituation was truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. By travelling bare|foot, over &s;uch a length of fore&s;t, and &s;upporting me on his &s;houlders, his feet were rendered &s;ore, beyond de&s;cription. I cannot expre&s;s too much gratitude, for Mr. Labarree's goodne&s;s. My infant was his &s;ole charge, and he &s;upported it, by pieces of the hor&s;e fle&s;h, which he kept for its u&s;e, which by being fir&s;t chewed in his own mouth, and then put into the child's, afforded it the nece&s;&s;ary nutriment. After &s;upper, my booth was made, the evening yell was &s;ounded, and we encamp|ed
<PB N="44" REF="030180_0044_0FE4C20B3B659100">
for the night. By this time the &s;av|ages, had relaxed part of their watchful|ne&s;s, and began to be carele&s;s of our e&s;cap|ing. Labarree and Farn&s;worth were &s;lightly bound, and my hu&s;band had all his liberty. My &s;i&s;ter could &s;leep with|out her two Indian companions, and the whole company appeared le&s;s like pri&s;on|ers.</P>
<P>IN the morning of the eighth day, we were rou&s;ed at &s;unri&s;e. Although the early part of September is generally ble&s;&s;|ed with a &s;erene &s;ky, and a warm &s;un, yet we &s;uffered exceedingly, by the cold. The mornings were damp and foggy, and the lofty trees, and numerous mountains, oft|en excluded the &s;un till noon. Our &s;nake|root broth, enriched with flour, made a rare breakfa&s;t, and gave a little &s;trength to our exhau&s;ted limbs. Orders came to "munch." My poor hu&s;band took me
<PB N="45" REF="030180_0045_0FE4C2128AE5DB20">
upon the pack &s;addle, and we rea&s;&s;umed our march. Long before night, de&s;ponden|cy had &s;trikingly pictured every counte|nance. My little &s;on, who had performed the whole journey on foot, was almo&s;t lifele&s;s. Mr. John&s;on was emaciated, and almo&s;t exhau&s;ted; often he laid me on the ground to &s;ave his own life, and mine; for my weakne&s;s was too great to ride far, without requiring re&s;t. While pro&s;trate upon the earth, and able to &s;peak, I oft|en begged him to leave me there, to end a life, which could la&s;t but a &s;hort time, and would take his with it, if he continued his exertions to &s;ave me; but the idea was too &s;hocking, we continued our journey, in a &s;low &s;orrowful mood, till night. Often did I mea&s;ure a &s;mall di&s;tance for the &s;un to run, before I mu&s;t bid it an eternal a|dieu. But the &s;ame Providence who had brought us &s;o far, and inclined our &s;avage ma&s;ters to mercy, continued my protector.
<PB N="46" REF="030180_0046_0FE4C214101EA1F8">
Farn&s;worth carried me a &s;mall di&s;tance, and at la&s;t darkne&s;s put an end to our painful day's journey. After the cu&s;tom|ary refre&s;hment, we went to re&s;t. The night was terrible; the fir&s;t part was E|gyptian darkne&s;s, then thunder, and lightning, and rain. On the cold earth, without a cover, our &s;ituation may be im|agined, but not de&s;cribed. The Indians gave me an additional blanket for my u&s;e, and &s;hewed &s;ome concern for my welfare; but it will ever &s;tand fir&s;t among modern miracles, that my life was &s;pared.</P>
<P>THE morning came, and a bright &s;un reanimated our drowned &s;pirits. The whole company now re&s;embled a group of gho&s;ts, more than bodily forms. Little did I expect that the light of another day, would witne&s;s my exi&s;tence; &s;en&s;ible, that if my own &s;ad di&s;ea&s;es did not fini&s;h my exi&s;tence, that my hu&s;band would be re|duced
<PB N="47" REF="030180_0047_0FE4C21595BB7618">
to the woful alternative, of either peri&s;hing with me, or leaving me in the woods to pre&s;erve his own life. The hor|rid yell was given, which was a &s;ignal for preparation. Melancholy &s;at heavily on every countenance, and the tear of woe moi&s;tened the &s;ickened cheek of every pri&s;|oner. In addition to famine and fatigue, &s;o long a journey, without a &s;hoe, for de|fence, had lacerated and mangled every foot, to a &s;hocking degree; travelling was keenly painful.&mdash;The &s;canty breakfa&s;t was &s;erved up; as I was lifting my gill of broth to my cold lips, my ma&s;ter, with a ra&s;h hand, pulled it from me, and gave it to my hu&s;band, ob&s;erving, by &s;igns, that he required all the &s;u&s;tenance, to enable him to carry me. I yielded, on the &s;up|po&s;ition that it was a matter of little con|&s;equence, whether any thing was be&s;tow|ed to that body which mu&s;t &s;oon mingle with its original clay. With &s;orrow and
<PB N="48" REF="030180_0048_0FE4C2182E64B580">
angui&s;h, we began the ninth day's journey. Before we proceeded far, the Indians &s;ig|nified to us, that we &s;hould arrive, before night, at Ea&s;t Bay, on Lake Champlain. This was a cordial to our drooping &s;pirits, and cau&s;ed an immediate tran&s;ition from de&s;pair to joy; the idea of arriving at a place of water carriage, tran&s;lated us to new life. Tho&s;e who langui&s;hed with &s;ickne&s;s, fatigue or de&s;pair, now marched forward, with nervous alacrity. Two In|dians were &s;ent on a hunting &s;cout, who were to meet us at the Bay, with canoes. This &s;ea&s;onable and agreeable intelligence, had every po&s;&s;ible effect that was good, we walked with greater &s;peed, felt le&s;s of the journey, and thought little of our di&s;|tre&s;&s;es. About the middle of the after|noon the waters of the Lake were &s;een, from a neighboring eminence; we &s;oon gained the bank, where we found the two Indians, with four canoes, and a ground
<PB N="49" REF="030180_0049_0FE4C21DE63330A8">
&s;quirrel; a fire was built, and &s;ome food put in preparation. Here my feelings, which had not been exhilirated, &s;o much as the re&s;t of my fellow pri&s;oners, were buoyed above de&s;pair, and, for a &s;hort time, the pangs of di&s;tre&s;s lo&s;t their influence. The life, which nine days painful &s;uffering in the wilderne&s;s, had brought to its la&s;t mo|ment of duration, now &s;tarted into new ex|i&s;tence, and rendered the hour I &s;at on the &s;hore of Lake Champlain, the happie&s;t I ever experienced. Here we were to take pa&s;&s;age, in boats, and find relief from the thorny hills and miry &s;wamps of the damp-de&s;art. My hu&s;band could now be relieved, from the burden, which had brought him as nigh eternity, as my&s;elf. My little children would &s;oon find cloth|ing, and all my fellow &s;ufferers would be in a condition to attain &s;ome of life's con|veniences; Twelve hours &s;ailing would waft us to the &s;ettlements of civilized

Frenchmen. Con&s;idering how much we had endured, few will deem it le&s;s than a miracle, that we were &s;till among the liv|ing. My &s;on, of &s;ix years old, had walk|ed barefoot the whole journey. Farn&s;|worth was &s;hoele&s;s, and carried my elde&s;t daughter. Labarree had to carry, and pre&s;erve the life of my infant. My &s;i&s;ter, owing to her youth and health, had &s;uf|fered the lea&s;t. My two little daughters, with only their &s;hifts, and part of one of the three gowns, which the &s;avage gave me, were &s;ubject to all the damps of morn and night; and Mr. John&s;on's &s;ituation was pitiably painful; the fatigue of carry|ing me on the wearying pack &s;addle, had rendered his emaciated body almo&s;t a corp&s;e, and his &s;ore feet made him a crip|ple. The Indians had been &s;urpri&s;ingly patient, and often di&s;covered tokens of hu|manity. At every meal, we all &s;hared e|qual with them, whether a hor&s;e or a duck

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Cro&s;&s;ing the Lake to Crown Point, from thence to St. Johns&mdash;Chamblee&mdash;and to St. Francis's Village.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL only detain the reader a few moments longer in this place, while I eat the leg of a woodchuck, and then re|que&s;t him to take a night's &s;ailing in the canoe with me acro&s;s the Lake. Though I &s;incerely wi&s;h him a better pa&s;&s;age than I had. No &s;ooner was our repa&s;t fini&s;h|ed, than the party were divided into four equal parties, for pa&s;&s;age. In my boat were two &s;avages, be&s;ides my &s;on and in|fant. I was ordered to lie flat on the bot|tom of the canoe, and when pain obliged me to move for relief, I had a rap from a paddle. At day break, we arrived at a
<PB N="53" REF="030180_0053_0FE4C22C487EFCE0">
great rock, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Lake, where we &s;topped and built a fire. The Indians went to a French hou&s;e, not far di&s;tant, and got &s;ome meat, bread, and green corn. Although we were not al|lowed to ta&s;te the meat, yet, by the grate|ful effluvia of the broiling &s;teak, we were finely regaled, and the bread and roa&s;t corn, were a luxury. Here the &s;avages, for the fir&s;t time, gave loud tokens of joy, by hallooing and yelling in a tremendous manner. The pri&s;oners were now intro|duced to a new &s;chool. Little did we ex|pect that the accompli&s;hment of dancing, would ever be taught us, by the &s;avages. But the war dance mu&s;t now be held; and every pri&s;one that could move, mu&s;t take its awkward &s;teps. The figure con|&s;i&s;ted of circular motion, round the fire; each &s;ang his own mu&s;ick, and the be&s;t dancer was the one mo&s;t violent in motion. The pri&s;oners were taught each a &s;ong,
<PB N="54" REF="030180_0054_0FE4C22DE763EC60">
mine was, danna witchee natchepung; my &s;on's was narwi&s;cumptom. The re&s;t I cannot recollect. Whether this talk was impo&s;ed on us for their diver&s;ion, or a re|ligious ceremonial, I cannot &s;ay, but it was very painful and offen&s;ive. In the fore|noon, &s;even Indians came to us, who were received with great joy, by our ma&s;ters, who took great plea&s;ure in introducing their pri&s;oners. The war dance was a|gain held; we were obliged to join, and &s;ing our &s;ongs, while the Indians rent the air with infernal yelling. We then em|barked and arrived at Crown Point about noon. Each pri&s;oner was then led by their ma&s;ters, to the re&s;idence of the French Commander. The Indians kept up their infernal yelling the whole time. We were ordered to his apartment, and u&s;ed with that ho&s;pitality, which characterizes the be&s;t part of the nation. We had brandy in profu&s;ion, a good dinner, and
<PB N="55" REF="030180_0055_0FE4C22F6D569528">
a change of linen. This was luxury in|deed, after what we had &s;uffered, for the want of the&s;e things. None but our&s;elves could prize their value. We, after din|ner, were paraded before Mr. Commander, and underwent examination, after which we were &s;hewn a convenient apartment, where we re&s;ided four days, not &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of our &s;avage ma&s;ters. Here we received great civilities, and many pre&s;ents. I had a nur&s;e, who in a great mea&s;ure, re&s;tored my exhau&s;ted &s;trength. My children were all decently clothed, and my infant in particular. The fir&s;t day, while I was taking a nap, they dre&s;&s;|ed it &s;o fanta&s;tically, a la France, that I re|fu&s;ed to own it, when brought to my bed|&s;ide, not gue&s;&s;ing that I was the mother of &s;uch a &s;trange thing.</P>
<P>ON the fourth day, to our great grief and mortification, we were again delivered to the Indians, who led us to the water
<PB N="56" REF="030180_0056_0FE4C232027CDB28">
&s;ide, where we all embarked in one ve&s;&s;el for St. Johns. The wind &s;hifted, after a &s;hort &s;ail and we dropped anchor. In a little time, a canoe came a long &s;ide of us, in which was a white woman, who was bound for Albany. Mr. John&s;on beg|ged her to &s;top a few minutes, while he wrote to Col. Lydius, of Albany, to in|form him of our &s;ituation, and to reque&s;t him to put the &s;ame in the Bo&s;ton new&s;|papers, that our friends might learn that we were alive. The woman delivered the letter, and the contents were publi&s;hed, which conveyed the agreeable tidings to our friends, that although pri&s;oners, we were then alive.</P>
<P>AFTER a di&s;agreeable voyage of three days, we made St. Johns, the &s;ixteenth of September, where we again experienced the politene&s;s of a French Commander. I, with my child, was kindly lodged in the
<PB N="57" REF="030180_0057_0FE4C2395C4ECF98">
&s;ame room with him&s;elf and lady. In the morning, we &s;till found misfortune tread|ing clo&s;e at our heels;&mdash;we mu&s;t again be delivered to our &s;avage ma&s;ters, and take another pa&s;&s;age in the boats for Chamblee, when within three miles of which, Labar|ree, my&s;elf and child, with our two ma&s;|ters, were put on &s;hore; we were ignorant of our de&s;tiny, and parting from my hu&s;|band and friends, was a &s;evere trial, with|out knowing whether we were ever to meet them again. We walked on to Chamblee; here our fears were di&s;&s;ipated, by meeting our friends. In the garri&s;on of this place, we found all the ho&s;pitality our nece&s;&s;ities required. Here, for the fir&s;t, after my captivity, I lodged on a bed. Brandy was handed about in large bowls, and we lived in high &s;tyle. The next morning we were put in the cu&s;tody of our old ma&s;ters, who took us to the canoes, in which we had a painful voyage that day,
<PB N="58" REF="030180_0058_0FE4C23B211C1AD0">
and the following night to Sorell; where we arrived on the nineteenth. A ho&s;pi|table friar came to the &s;hore to &s;ee us, and invited us to his hou&s;e; he gave us a good breakfa&s;t, and drank our better healths, in a tumbler of brandy; he took compa&s;&s;ion|ate notice of my child, and ordered it &s;ome &s;uitable food. But the Indians hurried us off, before it could eat. He then went with us to the &s;hore, and ordered his &s;er|vant to carry the food, prepared for the child, to the canoe, where he waited till I fed it. The friar was a very genteel man, and gave us his benediction, at part|ing, in feeling language. We then row|ed on till the middle of the afternoon, when we landed on a barren heath, and by the help of a fire, cooked an Indian dinner; after which the war dance was held, and another infernal yelling. The pri&s;oners were obliged to &s;ing, till they were hoar&s;e, and dance round the fire.
<PB N="59" REF="030180_0059_0FE4C23CA3D9BFE8">
We had now arrived within a few miles of the village St. Francis, to which place our ma&s;ters belonged. Whenever the warriors return from an excur&s;ion again&s;t an enemy, their return to the tribe or vil|lage, mu&s;t be de&s;ignated by warlike cer|emonial; the captives or &s;poil, which may happen to crown their valour, mu&s;t be conducted in a triumphant form, and decorated to every po&s;&s;ible advantage. For this end we mu&s;t now &s;ubmit to paint|ing; their vermillion, with which they were ever &s;upplied, was mixed with bear's grea&s;e, and every cheek, chin, and fore|head, mu&s;t have a da&s;h. We then rowed on within a mile of the town, where we &s;topped at a French hou&s;e, to dine; the pri&s;oners were &s;erved with &s;oup meagre, and bread. After dinner, two &s;avages proceeded to the village, to carry the glad tidings of our arrival. The whole atmo&s;|phere &s;oon re&s;ounded from every quarter,
<PB N="60" REF="030180_0060_0FE4C23F2FFA12F0">
with whoops, yells, &s;hrieks, and &s;creams. St. Francis, from the noi&s;e that came from it, might be &s;uppo&s;ed the centre of Pan|demonium. Our ma&s;ters were not back|ward, they made every re&s;pon&s;e they po&s;|&s;ibly could. The whole time we were &s;ailing from the French hou&s;e, the noi&s;e was direful to be heard. Two hours before &s;un|&s;et, we came to the landing, at the village. No &s;ooner had we landed, than the yell|ing in the town was redoubled, a cloud of &s;avages, of all &s;izes, and &s;exes, &s;oon appear|ed running towards us; when they reached the boats, they formed them&s;elves into a long parade, leaving a &s;mall &s;pace, through which we mu&s;t pa&s;s. Each Indian then took his pri&s;oner by his hand, and after ordering him to &s;ing the war &s;ong, began to march through the gauntlet. We ex|pected a &s;evere beating, before we got through, but were agreeably di&s;appointed, when we found that each Indian only gave
<PB N="61" REF="030180_0061_0FE4C2478D7F75A8">
us a tap on the &s;houlder. We were led directly to the hou&s;es, each taking his pri&s;oner to his own wigwam. When I entered my ma&s;ter's door, his brother &s;a|luted me with a large belt of wampum, and my ma&s;ter pre&s;ented me with another. Both were put over my &s;houlders, and cro&s;&s;ed behind and before. My new home was not the mo&s;t agreeable; a large wigwam without a floor, with a &s;ire in the centre, and only a few water ve&s;&s;els and di&s;hes, to eat from, made of birch bark, and tools for cookery, made clum&s;ily of wood, for furniture, will not be thought a plea&s;ing re&s;idence to one accu&s;tomed to civilized life&punc;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Re&s;idence at St. Francis. Sale of mo&s;t of the Pri&s;oners to the French, and Removal to Montreal.</HEAD>
<P>NIGHT pre&s;ently came, after our arrival at St. Francis. Tho&s;e, who have felt the gloomy, home&s;ick feelings, which &s;adden tho&s;e hours which a youth pa&s;&s;es, when fir&s;t from a father's hou&s;e, may judge of part of my &s;ufferings; but when the re&s;t of my circum&s;tances are ad|ded, their conception mu&s;t fall infinitely &s;hort. I now found my&s;elf, with my in|fant, in a large wigwam, accompanied with two or three warriors, and as many &s;quaws, where I mu&s;t &s;pend the night, and perhaps a year. My fellow pri&s;oners were di&s;po&s;ed over the town; each one,
<PB N="63" REF="030180_0063_0FE4C24AD96E77B0">
probably, feeling the &s;ame gloomine&s;s, with my&s;elf. Ha&s;ty pudding pre&s;ently was brought forward, for &s;upper. A &s;pa|cious bowl of wood, well filled, was placed in a central &s;pot, and each one drew near with a wooden &s;poon. As the Indians never u&s;e &s;eats, nor have any in their wig|wams, my awkwardne&s;s in taking my po&s;i|tion, was a matter of no &s;mall amu&s;ement to my new companions. The &s;quaws fir&s;t fall upon their knees, and then &s;it back upon their heels. This was a po&s;ture that I could not imitate. To &s;it in any other, was thought by them, indelicate and un|polite. But I advanced to my pudding, with the be&s;t grace I could, not, however, e&s;caping &s;ome of their funny remarks. When the hour for &s;leep came on, for it would be improper to call it bedtime, where beds were not, I was pointed to a platform, rai&s;ed half a yard, where upon a board, covered with a blanket, I was to
<PB N="64" REF="030180_0064_0FE4C24D6E0B79C0">
pa&s;s the night. The Indians threw them|&s;elves down, in various parts of the building, in a manner that more re&s;em|bled cows, in a &s;hed, than human beings, in a hou&s;e. In the morning, our break|fa&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of the relicks of the la&s;t night; my &s;i&s;ter came to &s;ee me in the forenoon, and we &s;pent &s;ome hours, in ob&s;ervations upon our &s;ituation, while wa&s;hing &s;ome apparel, at a little brook. In the after|noon, I with my infant, was taken to the grand parade, where we found a large col|lection of the village inhabitants; an aged chief &s;tepped forward, into an area, and after every noi&s;e was &s;ilenced, and every one fixed in profound attention, he began to harrangue; his manner was &s;olemn&mdash; his motions and expre&s;&s;ion gave me a per|fect idea of an orator. Not a breath was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and every &s;pectator &s;eemed to rev|erence what he &s;aid. After the &s;peech, my little &s;on was brought to the oppo&s;ite
<PB N="65" REF="030180_0065_0FE4C2530F0467F8">
&s;ide of the parade, and a number of blank|ets laid by his &s;ide. It now appeared that his ma&s;ter and mine, intended a &s;wop of pri&s;oners. My ma&s;ter being a hunter, wi&s;hed for my &s;on, to attend him on his excur&s;ions. Each delivered his property with great for|mality; my &s;on and blankets, being an equiv|alent for my&s;elf, child, and wampum. I was taken to the hou&s;e of my new ma&s;ter, and found my&s;elf allied to the fir&s;t family; my ma&s;ter was &s;on in law to the grand &s;achem, was accounted rich, had a &s;tore of goods, and lived in a &s;tyle far above the majority of his tribe. Soon after my arrival at his hou&s;e, the interpreter came to inform me, that I was adopted into his family. I was then introduced to the family, and was told to call them brothers and &s;i&s;ters.&mdash;I made a &s;hort reply, expre&s;&s;ive of gratitude, for being introduced to a hou&s;e of high blood, and reque&s;ted their patience, while I &s;hould learn the cu&s;toms of the nation.
<PB N="66" REF="030180_0066_0FE4C2559C69D978">
This was &s;carce over, when the attention of the village was called to the grand pa|rade, to attend a rejoicing, occa&s;ioned by the arrival of &s;ome warriors, who had brought &s;ome &s;calps. They were carried in triumph on a pole. Savage butchery, upon murdered countrymen. The &s;ight was horrid. As I retired to my new re&s;i|dence, I could hear the &s;avage yells, that accompany the war dance. I &s;pent the night in &s;ad reflection.</P>
<P>MY time now was &s;olitary beyond de|&s;cription; my new &s;i&s;ters and brothers treated me with the &s;ame attention that they did their natural kindred, but it was an unnatural &s;ituation to me. I was a novice at making canoes, bunks, and tumplines, which was the only occupation of the &s;quaws; of cour&s;e, idlene&s;s was a|mong my calamities.&mdash;My fellow pri&s;on|ers, were as gloomy as my&s;elf ignorant,
<PB N="67" REF="030180_0067_0FE4C25721A357E8">
whether they were to &s;pend their days in this inactive village, to be carried into a war campaign, to &s;laughter their country|men, or to be dragged to the cold Lakes of the north, in a hunting voyage. We vi&s;ited each other daily, and &s;pent our time in conjecturing our future de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>THE &s;pace of forty five years having e|lap&s;ed, &s;ince my re&s;idence in St. Francis, it is impo&s;&s;ible to give the reader a minute detail of events, that occurred, while there; many of them are &s;till forcibly impre&s;&s;ed upon my memory, but dates and particu|lars, are now inaccurately trea&s;ured up, by faint recollection. Mr. John&s;on tarried but a few days with me, before he was carried to Montreal, to be &s;old. My two daughters, &s;i&s;ter and Labarree, were &s;oon after carried to the &s;ame place, at different times. Farn&s;worth was carried by his ma&s;ter, on a hunting &s;cout, but not prov|ing
<PB N="68" REF="030180_0068_0FE4C259AF4CD360">
&s;o active in the cha&s;e and ambu&s;h, as they wi&s;hed, he was returned, and &s;ent to Montreal. I now found an increa&s;e to my trouble, with only my &s;on and infant, in this &s;trange land, without a pro&s;pect of relief, and with all my former trouble lying heavy upon me, di&s;appointment and de|&s;pair came well nigh being my execution|ers. In this dilemma, who can imagine my di&s;tre&s;s, when my little &s;on came run|ning to me one morning, &s;wollen with tears, exclaiming, that the Indians were going to carry him into the woods to hunt; he had &s;carcely told the piteous &s;tory, before his ma&s;ter came, to pull him away; he threw his little arms around me, begging in the agony of grief, that I would keep him. The inexorable &s;avage, unclenched his hands, and forced him away; the la&s;t words I heard, intermingled with his cries, were, Ma'am I &s;hall never &s;ee you again. The keenne&s;s of my pangs, almo&s;t obliged
<PB N="69" REF="030180_0069_0FE4C260AF10C848">
me to wi&s;h that I never had been a moth|er. Farewell, Sylvanus, &s;ays I, God will pre&s;erve you.</P>
<P>IT was now the fifteenth of October. Forty five days had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince my cap|tivity, and no pro&s;pect, but what was darkened with clouds of misfortune. The unea&s;ine&s;s occa&s;ioned by indolence, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure relieved, by the privilege of making &s;hirts for my brother. At night and morn, I was allowed to milk the cows. The re&s;t of the time I &s;trolled gloomily about, looking &s;ometimes into an un&s;ocia|ble wigwam, at others &s;auntering into the bu&s;hes, and walking on the banks of brooks. Once, I went to a French hou&s;e, three miles di&s;tant, to vi&s;it &s;ome friends of my brother's family, where I was enter|tained politely a week; at another time, I went with a party to fi&s;h, accompanied by a number of &s;quaws. My weakne&s;s
<PB N="70" REF="030180_0070_0FE4C262737C1590">
obliged me to re&s;t often, which gave my companions a poor opinion of me; but they &s;hewed no other re&s;entment, than calling me "no good &s;quaw," which was the only reproach my &s;i&s;ter ever gave, when I di&s;plea&s;ed her. All the French in|habitants I formed an acquaintance with, treated me with that civility, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the nation; once in particular, be|ing almo&s;t di&s;tracted with an aching tooth, I was carried to a French phy&s;ician, a|cro&s;s the river, for relief. They prevailed on the Indians, to let me vi&s;it them a day or two, during which time, their mark|ed attention and genero&s;ity, claims my warme&s;t gratitude. At parting, they ex|pre&s;&s;ed their earne&s;t wi&s;hes to have me vi&s;it them again.</P>
<P>ST. Francis contained about thirty wig|wams, which were thrown di&s;orderly into a clump. There was a church, in which
<PB N="71" REF="030180_0071_0FE4C263F7D267C0">
ma&s;s was held every night and morning, and every Sunday, the hearers were &s;um|moned by a bell; and attendance was pretty general. Ceremonies were per|formed by a French friar, who lived in the mid&s;t of them, for the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls. He appeared to be in that place, what the legi&s;lative branch is in civil gov|ernments, and the grand &s;achem the executive. The inhabitants lived in per|fect harmony, holding mo&s;t of their prop|erty in common. They were prone to indolence, when at home, and not remark|able for neatne&s;s. They were extremely mode&s;t, and apparently aver&s;e to airs of court&s;hip. Nece&s;&s;ity was the only thing that called them to action, this induced them to plant their corn, and to undergo the fatigues of hunting. Perhaps I am wrong, to call nece&s;&s;ity the only motive; revenge, which prompts them to war, has great power. I had a numerous retinue
<PB N="72" REF="030180_0072_0FE4C2668A90B258">
of relations, which I vi&s;ited daily; but my brother's hou&s;e, being one of the mo&s;t decent in the village, I fared full as well at home. Among my connexions, was a little brother Sabatis, who brought the cows for me, and took particular notice of my child. He was a &s;prightly little fel|low, and often amu&s;ed me, with feats per|formed with his bow and arrow.</P>
<P>IN the early part of November, Mr. John&s;on wrote from Montreal, reque&s;ting me to prevail on the Indians, to carry me to Montreal, for &s;ale, as he had made pro|vi&s;ion for that purpo&s;e. I di&s;clo&s;ed the matter, which was agreed to by my broth|er and &s;i&s;ter, and, on the &s;eventh, we &s;et &s;ail in a little bark canoe. While cro&s;&s;|ing Lake St. Peters, we came nigh land|ing on the &s;hores of eternity. The waves were rai&s;ed to an enormous height, by the wind, and often broke over the canoe.
<PB N="73" REF="030180_0073_0FE4C26C116D1328">
My brother and &s;i&s;ter, were pale as gho&s;ts, and we all expected immediate de&s;truction; but the arm of Salvation was extended for our relief, and we reached the &s;hore. We were four days in this voyage, and receiv|ed obliging civilities every night, at French &s;ettlements; on the eleventh, we arrived at Montreal, where I had the &s;upreme &s;atisfaction of meeting my hu&s;band, chil|dren, and friends. Here I had the happi|ne&s;s to find, that all my fellow pri&s;oners had been purcha&s;ed, by gentlemen of re|&s;pectability, by whom they were treated with great humanity. Mr. Du Que&s;ne bought my &s;i&s;ter, my elde&s;t daughter was owned by three affluent old maids, by the name of Jai&s;&s;on, and the other was owned by the mayor of the city.</P>
<P>MR. John&s;on had obtained the privi|lege of two month's ab&s;ence, on parole, for the purpo&s;e of going to Newengland, to
<PB N="74" REF="030180_0074_0FE4C26E9D8B1088">
procure ca&s;h, for the redemption of his family; he &s;at out on his journey the day after my arrival at Montreal. Mr. Du Que&s;ne engaged to &s;upply his family with nece&s;&s;aries, during his ab&s;ence, and was to be recompen&s;ed at his return. Directly after his departure, I found my&s;elf doom|ed to fre&s;h trouble. The Indians brought me here, for the purpo&s;e of ex|changing me for &s;ome Micanaw &s;avages, a tribe with whom they were at war; but being di&s;appointed in this, they were ex|orbitant in their demands, and refu&s;ed to take le&s;s than a thou&s;and livres, for me, and my child, Mr. Du Que&s;ne fixed his offer at &s;even hundred, which was utterly refu&s;ed, by my &s;avage ma&s;ters. Their next &s;tep was, to threaten to carry me back to St. Francis. After a half day's &s;urly deliberation, they concluded to take the offered &s;um. I was received into Mr. Du Que&s;ne's family. My joy at be|ing
<PB N="75" REF="030180_0075_0FE4C2702109AFF8">
delivered from &s;avage captivity, was unbounded. From this period, Indians and &s;ufferings were no more to torture me, or my family, except the unfortunate Syl|vanus. The fond idea of liberty, held forth its dazzling plea&s;ures, and the ignorance of future calamities, precluded every cloud, that could ob&s;cure its effulgence. On Mr. John&s;on's journey to Newengland, I re&s;t|ed all my hope, and felt full confidence in being relieved at his return.</P>
<P>IN ju&s;tice to the Indians, I ought to remark, that they never treated me with cruelty, to a wanton degree; few people have &s;urvived a &s;ituation like mine, and few have fallen into the hands of &s;avages, di&s;po&s;ed to more lenity and patience. Mode&s;ty has ever been a characteri&s;tick of every &s;avage tribe; a truth which my whole family will join to corroborate, to the extent of their knowledge. As they
<PB N="76" REF="030180_0076_0FE4C272AB2987B0">
are aptly called the children of nature, tho&s;e who have profited by refinement and education, ought to abate part of the prejudice, which prompts them to look with an eye of cen&s;ure on this untutored race. Can it be &s;aid of civilized conquer|ors, that they, in the main, are willing to &s;hare with their pri&s;oners, the la&s;t ration of food, when famine &s;tares them in the face? Do they ever adopt an enemy, and &s;alute him by the tender name of brother? And I am ju&s;tified in doubting, whether if I had fallen into the hands of French &s;oldiery, &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity would have been &s;hewn, to pre&s;erve my life.</P>

<P>THE reader will leave me, and my family, under the care of our factor, a &s;hort time, and proceed with Mr. John&s;on. On the twelth of November, he &s;at forward for Albany, accompanied by two Indians for pilots, for who&s;e fi|delity, the commander in chief was re&s;pon|&s;ible.

</LETTER>
<P>ON the receipt of this letter, he return|ed with a heavy heart to Bo&s;ton, and was po&s;itively ordered, by Shirley, to &s;tay till
<PB N="86" REF="030180_0086_0FE4C29459518588">
further orders. His &s;ituation now, was really deplorable. His parole, which was only for two months, mu&s;t be violated; his credit in Canada lo&s;t. His family expo&s;ed to the malice of exa&s;perated Frenchmen, and all his good pro&s;pects, at an end. Af|ter u&s;ing every exertion, in Bo&s;ton, for leave to recommence his journey, and &s;pending the re&s;t of the winter, and all the &s;pring, he found his efforts were in vain. During this time, my &s;ituation grew daily di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. Mr. Du Que&s;ne made honorable provi&s;ion for my&s;elf, &s;i&s;|ter, and child, till the expiration of my hu&s;band's parole; the two Indians were then &s;ent to Albany, to pilot him back; after waiting &s;ome time, and learning nothing a|bout him, they returned. Previous to this, I had been treated with great attention and civility; dined frequently in the fir&s;t families, received cards, to attend them on parties of plea&s;ure, and was introduced to
<PB N="87" REF="030180_0087_0FE4C295DD84A7E8">
a large and re&s;pectable acquaintance. As an unfortunate woman, I received tho&s;e general tokens of genero&s;ity, which flow from a humane people. Among the pre&s;|ents which I received, was one of no &s;mall magnitude, from Captains Stowbrow and Vambram, two gentlemen, who were de|livered by Major Wa&s;hington, as ho&s;tages, when he, with the Virginia troops, &s;urren|dered to the French and Indians. In compliance with their billet, I waited on them one morning, and, at parting, receiv|ed a pre&s;ent of one hundred and forty eight livres. Mr. St. Ange, a French gentleman of fortune, and di&s;tinction, be|&s;ide frequent proofs of his goodne&s;s, gave me, at one time, forty eight livres. In his family, I formed an intimate acquaint|ance, with a young Engli&s;h lady, who was captured by the Indians, in the Province of Maine, and &s;old to him; &s;he was u&s;ed with parental tenderne&s;s, and &s;hared the
<PB N="88" REF="030180_0088_0FE4C29864715498">
privileges of his children; &s;he, with his daughter, frequently came in their morn|ing carriage, to ride with my &s;i&s;ter and me. Gratitude to my numerous bene|factors, pleads loudly in favor of in&s;erting all their names, and particularizing every act of genero&s;ity. If I omit it, it mu&s;t not be imagined that I have forgotten their charity; it has left an impre&s;&s;ion on my heart, that can only be era&s;ed with the extinction of life.</P>
<P>WHILE in Mr. Du Que&s;nes family, my little daughter was very unwell, and the &s;uper&s;titious people were convinced that &s;he would either die, or be carried off by the Devil, unle&s;s baptized. I yielded to their wi&s;hes, and they prepared for the ceremony, with all the appendages annexed to their religion. Mr. Du Que&s;|ne was godfather, and the young Engli&s;h lady godmother; by Mrs. Du Que&s;ne's
<PB N="89" REF="030180_0089_0FE4C29F5B6B5920">
particular reque&s;t, &s;he was chri&s;tened Louis, after her&s;elf&mdash;to which I added the name of Captive.</P>
<P>THE return of the Indians, without Mr. John&s;on, boded no good to me. I ob&s;erv|ed, with pain, the gradual change in my friends, from coldne&s;s to neglect, and from neglect to contempt. Mr. Du Que&s;ne, who had the mo&s;t delicate &s;en&s;e of honor, &s;uppo&s;ed that he had de&s;ignedly broken his parole, and abu&s;ed his confidence; he re|fu&s;ed to grant me further a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or even to &s;ee my face. I now found my|&s;elf friendle&s;s and alone; not a word had I heard from Mr. John&s;on, not a word had I heard from my little &s;on, with the Indians. Affliction lowered upon me, with all its hor|rors; in this dilemma, my &s;i&s;ter and I agreed to take a &s;mall room, and &s;upport our|&s;elves, till our little &s;tore of ca&s;h was expend|ed, and then have recour&s;e to our needles.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="030180_0090_0FE4C2A0E132C780">IN the beginning of April, the Indians made a &s;econd tour to Albany, in que&s;t of Mr. John&s;on, and again returned without him. I wrote to Col. Lydius, for infor|mation, but he could tell nothing. Dark|ne&s;s increa&s;ed; but I &s;ummoned all my re&s;olution, and indulged the fond hope, of being &s;oon relieved. We kept our little room till June, when I had the happine&s;s to hear, that my hu&s;band was without the city, waiting for permi&s;&s;ion to come in. He was conducted in by a file of men; his pre&s;ence bani&s;hed care and trouble, and turned the tear of &s;orrow, to the effu&s;ion of joy; after the gratulation of meeting had &s;ub&s;ided, he related his &s;ad fate in Newengland. He finally got permi&s;&s;ion from Gov. Wentworth, to come private|ly, by the way of Albany, where he took his bills, drawn by Mr. Cuyler, on Mr. St. Luc Lucorne, and Mr. Rine Du Que&s;ne. The face of affairs in Canada had mate|rially
<PB N="91" REF="030180_0091_0FE4C2A26624E098">
changed; during his ab&s;ence a new Governor had been &s;ent over, and various manoeuvres in politicks had taken place, which were very injurious to him. Had the old Governor tarried, his ab&s;ence would have probably been excu&s;ed. But Mon&s;. Vaudrieul was ignorant of the con|ditions, on which he went home, and could not admit apologies, for the breach of his parole. Our di&s;appointment and morti|fication were &s;evere, when we found our bills prote&s;ted. This reduced us at once to a beggarly &s;tate. The evil was partial|ly remedied, by St. Luc Lucorne's lend|ing us paper money, while we could &s;end &s;ome Indians, to Mr. Cuyler, for &s;ilver. Mr. John&s;on received orders to &s;ettle his affairs, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>SPIRITED preparations were now mak|ing for war. General Die&s;kau, arrived from France, with an army, and Montreal
<PB N="92" REF="030180_0092_0FE4C2A4E55B4350">
was a &s;cene of bu&s;y confu&s;ion. We were completing our &s;ettlements, with our pa|per, expecting to have full permi&s;&s;ion to go home, when the Indians returned. But the mea&s;ure of our mi&s;ery was not yet full. In the beginning of July, Mr. John&s;on was put into jail. Terrible to me, was this unexpected &s;troke; without money, credit or friends, I mu&s;t now roam the &s;treets, without a pro&s;pect of relief, from the cloud of misfortune, that hung over me. In a few days, the faithful Indians, who had been &s;ent to Mr. Cuyler, for the &s;ilver, returned, with four hundred and thirty eight dollars, with an order on St. Luc Lucorne, for &s;even hundred addi|tional livres; but he took the whole into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and we never after received a penny from him.</P>
<P>HALF di&s;tracted, and almo&s;t exhau&s;ted with de&s;pair and grief, I went to the Gov|ernor,
<PB N="93" REF="030180_0093_0FE4C2A98E943D20">
to paint our di&s;tre&s;s, and a&s;k relief. I found him of ea&s;y acce&s;s, and he heard my lamentable &s;tory, with &s;eeming emo|tion; his only promi&s;e was, to take care of us, and, at parting, he gave me a crown, to buy milk for my babes. Ignorant of our de&s;tiny, my &s;i&s;ter and I, kept our little room, and were fortunate enough, to get &s;ub&s;i&s;tance from day to day. Often going to the gloomy pri&s;on, to &s;ee my poor hu&s;|band, who&s;e misfortunes in Bo&s;ton had brought him to this wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>OUR own misfortunes had taught us how to feel for the &s;ufferings of others, and large demands were now made, on our &s;ympathetick powers. Ju&s;t as we were plunged into this new di&s;tre&s;s, a &s;cout of &s;avages brought a number of pri&s;oners in|to Montreal, which were our old friends
<PB N="94" REF="030180_0094_0FE4C2AC60CB2440">
and acquaintance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two children from Mr. H. Grout's family, and two children belonging to Mrs. How, the fair captive, celebrated in Col. Humphrey's life of Putnam. Their names were Polly and Submit Phips. Mrs. How was then a pri&s;oner at St. Johns, with &s;ix other children, and one Garfield. They were all taken at Hin&s;dale.&mdash;Mrs. How's daugh|ters were purcha&s;ed by Mon&s;. Vaudrieul, the Governor, and had every attention paid their ed|ucation. After a year's re&s;idence in Montreal, they were &s;ent to the grand nunnery in Quebec, where my &s;i&s;ter and I, made them a vi&s;it; they were beautiful girls, cheerful and well taught. We here found two aged Engli&s;h ladies, who had been taken in former wars. One, by the name of Wheel|right, who had a brother in Bo&s;ton, on whom &s;he reque&s;ted me to call, if ever I went to that place; I complied with her reque&s;t afterwards, and receiv|ed many civilities from her brother.</NOTE> Our meeting was a &s;cene of &s;orrow, and melancholly plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>ALL were now flocking to the &s;tandard of war. The Indians came from all quar|ters,
<PB N="95" REF="030180_0095_0FE4C2AEEF6306F8">
thir&s;ting for Engli&s;h blood, and re|ceiving in&s;truction from the French. A number of tribes, with all their horrid weapons of war, paraded, one morning, before the General's hou&s;e, and held the war dance, and filled the air with infernal yells, after which, in a formal manner, they took the hatchet, again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and marched for the field of battle. Alas! my poor countrymen, thought I, how many of you are to derive mi&s;ery from the&s;e mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>ON the twenty &s;econd of July, Mr. John&s;on was taken from jail, and with my&s;elf, and our two younge&s;t children, were ordered on board a ve&s;&s;el for Que|bec. To leave our friends at Montreal, was a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing affair; my &s;i&s;ters ran&s;om had been paid, but &s;he could not go with us. She went into the family of the Lieut. Governor, where &s;he &s;upported

her&s;elf, with her needle. My elde&s;t daughter, was &s;till with the three old maids, who treated her tenderly. Labar|ree and Farn&s;worth, had paid the full price of their redemption, but were not allowed to go home. Not a word had we heard yet, from poor Sylvanus. We parted in tears, ignorant of our de&s;tina|tion, but little thinking, that we were to embark for a place of wretchedne&s;s and woe. After two days good &s;ailing, we ar|rived at Quebec, and were all conducted directly to jail.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Six month's re&s;idence in the Criminal Jail, and removal to the Civil Pri&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>WE now, to our inde&s;criba|ble pain, found the fallacy of Mr. Gover|nor's promi&s;es, for our welfare. This jail was a place, too &s;hocking for de&s;cription. In one corner, &s;at a poor being, half dead with the &s;mall pox; in another, were &s;ome lou&s;y blankets and &s;traw; in the centre &s;tood a few dirty di&s;hes, and the whole pre&s;ented a &s;cene mi&s;erable to view. The terrors of &s;tarvation, and the fear of &s;uffo|cating in filth, were overpowered, by the more alarming evil of the &s;mall pox, which none of us had had. But there was no retreat, re&s;ignation was our only re&s;ource; the fir&s;t fortnight we waited
<PB N="98" REF="030180_0098_0FE4C2B8298AEEF8">
anxiou&s;ly for the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, in which time, we were &s;upported by a &s;mall piece of meat a day, which was &s;tewed with &s;ome ru&s;ty cru&s;ts of bread, and brought to us in a pail, that &s;wine would run from. The &s;traw and lou&s;y blankets, were our only lodging, and the re&s;t of our furniture con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome wooden blocks, for &s;eats. On the fifteenth day, I was taken with the &s;mall pox, and removed to the ho&s;pital; leaving my hu&s;band and two children in the horrid pri&s;on. In two days, Mr. John&s;on put my younge&s;t child, Captive, out to nur&s;e. The woman kept the child but a few days, before &s;he returned it, owing to a mi&s;tru&s;t, that &s;he &s;hould not get her pay. But &s;hould it remain in pri&s;on, certain death mu&s;t be its portion. Her father was reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity, of reque&s;ting her, to carry it to the Lord In|tendant, and tell him, that he mu&s;t either allow her a compen&s;ation for keeping it,
<PB N="99" REF="030180_0099_0FE4C2B9AE7BDF30">
or it mu&s;t be left at his door. The good woman dre&s;&s;ed it decently, and obeyed her orders. Mr. Intendant &s;miled at her &s;tory, and took the child in his arms, &s;ay|ing, it was a pretty little Engli&s;h devil, it was a pity it &s;hould die; he ordered his clerk to draw an order for its allowance, and &s;he took good care of it, till the la&s;t of October, except a few days, while it had the &s;mall pox.</P>
<P>A few days after I left the pri&s;on, Mr. John&s;on and my other daughter, were tak|en with &s;ymptoms, and came to the ho&s;|pital to me. It is a &s;ingular in&s;tance of Divine Interpo&s;ition, that we all recov|ered from this malignant di&s;ea&s;e. We were remanded to pri&s;on, but were not compelled to our former rigid confine|ment. Mr. John&s;on was allowed, at cer|tain times, to go about the city, in que&s;t of provi&s;ion. But, on the twentieth of

October, St. Luc Lucorne arrived from Montreal, with the news of Die&s;kau's de|feat; he had ever &s;ince my hu&s;band's mi&s;|fortune, about his parole, been his per&s;e|cuting enemy. By his in&s;tigation, we were all put directly to clo&s;e pri&s;on.</P>
<P>THE ravages of the &s;mall pox, reduced us to the la&s;t extremity, and the foetid pri&s;|on, without fire or food, added bitterne&s;s to our di&s;tre&s;s. Mr. John&s;on preferred a petition to the Lord Intendant, &s;tating our melancholy &s;ituation. I had the lib|erty of pre&s;enting it my&s;elf, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Pertua, the interpreter, in whom we ever found a compa&s;&s;ionate friend, we got &s;ome &s;mall relief. About the fir&s;t of November. I was taken violent|ly ill of a fever, and was carried to the ho&s;pital, with my daughter Captive. Af|ter a month's re&s;idence there, with toler|able good attendance, I recovered from
<PB N="101" REF="030180_0101_0FE4C2BC324BA410">
my illne&s;s, and went back to my hu&s;band. While at the ho&s;pital, I found an oppor|tunity to convey the unwelcome tidings of our deplorable &s;ituation to my &s;i&s;ter, at Montreal, charging her to give my be&s;t love to my daughter Su&s;anna, and to in|form our fellow pri&s;oners, Labarree and Farn&s;worth, that our good wi&s;hes awaited them. Not a word had we yet heard from poor Sylvanus.</P>
<P>WINTER now began to approach, and the &s;evere fro&s;ts of Canada, operated keenly upon our feelings. Our pri&s;on was a horrid defence, from the bla&s;ts of December, with two chairs, and a heap of &s;traw, and two lou&s;y blankets, we may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to live uncomfortably; but, in addition to this, we had but one poor fire a day, and the iron grates gave free acce&s;s to the chills of the inclement &s;ky. A quart ba&s;on, was the only thing

allowed us to cook our &s;mall piece of meat and dirty cru&s;ts in, and it mu&s;t &s;erve at the &s;ame time for table furniture. In this &s;ad plight&mdash;a pri&s;oner&mdash;in jail&mdash;winter ap|proaching&mdash;conceive reader, for I cannot &s;peak our di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>OUR former benevolent friends, Cap|tains Stowbrow and Vambram, had the peculiar misfortune, to be ca&s;t into a pri&s;|on, oppo&s;ite to us. Su&s;picion of having corre&s;ponded with their countrymen, was the crime, with which they were charged. Their misfortune did not preclude the ex|ertion of genero&s;ity; they frequently &s;ent us, by the waiting maid, bottles of wine, and articles of provi&s;ion. But the malice of Frenchmen, had now arrived to &s;uch a pitch, again&s;t all our country, that We mu&s;t be deprived of the&s;e comforts. The&s;e good men were forbidden their of|fices of kindne&s;s, and our intercour&s;e was
<PB N="103" REF="030180_0103_0FE4C2C49D7D0E98">
entirely prohibited. We, however, found means, by &s;tratagem, to effect, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, what could not be done by open dealing. When the &s;ervants were carry|ing in our daily &s;upplies, we &s;lipped into the entry, and depo&s;ited our letters in an a&s;h box, which were taken by our friends, they leaving one at the &s;ame time for us; this &s;erved in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to amu&s;e a dull hour&mdash;&s;ometimes, we diverted our|&s;elves, by the u&s;e of Spani&s;h cards; as Mr. John&s;on was ignorant of the game, I de|rived no incon&s;iderable plea&s;ure from in|&s;tructing him. But the vigilance of our keepers increa&s;ed, and our paper and ink were withheld.&mdash;We had now been pri&s;on|ers &s;eventeen months, and our pro&s;pects were changing from bad to wor&s;e, five months had elap&s;ed, &s;ince our confine|ment in this horrid receptacle, except the time we lingered in the ho&s;pital. Our jailer was a true de&s;cendant from Pha|raoh;
<PB N="104" REF="030180_0104_0FE4C2C62149CA20">
but, urged by impatience and de|&s;pair, I &s;oftened him &s;o much, as to get him to a&s;k Mr. Pertua, to call on us. When the good man came, we de&s;cribed our &s;ituation, in all the moving terms, which our feelings in&s;pired, which in ad|dition to what he &s;aw, convinced him of the reality of our di&s;tre&s;s. He propo&s;ed a&s;king an influential friend of his, to call on us, who, perhaps, would devi&s;e &s;ome mode, for our relief. The next day, the gentleman came to &s;ee us; he was one of tho&s;e good &s;ouls, who ever feel for others woes. He was highly affronted with his countrymen, for reducing us to &s;uch di&s;|tre&s;s, and declared, that the Lord Intend|ant him&s;elf, &s;hould call on us, and &s;ee the extremities to which he had reduced us; he &s;ent, from his own hou&s;e, that night, a kettle, &s;ome candles, and each of us a change of linen.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="030180_0105_0FE4C2C8A444BAA0">THE next day, January 8th, 1756, Mr. Intendant came to &s;ee us; he exculpated him&s;elf, by &s;aying, that we were put there, by the &s;pecial order of Mon&s;. Vaudrieul, the Governor in chief, and that he had no authority to relea&s;e us. But he would convey a letter from Mr. John&s;on to Mon&s;ieur, which might have the de&s;ired effect. The letter was accordingly writ|ten, &s;tating our troubles, and be&s;eeching relief; likewi&s;e praying that our &s;on might be got from the Indians, and &s;ent to us, with our daughter and &s;i&s;ter, from Mon|treal.

</LETTER>
<P>FROM the receipt of this letter, we dat|ed our e&s;cape from direful bondage. Mr. Intendant ordered us directly to the new jail, called the civil pri&s;on, where our ac|comodations were infinitely better. We
<PB N="107" REF="030180_0107_0FE4C2D1B0011BB8">
had a decent bed, candles, fuel, and all the conveniences belonging to pri&s;oners of war. Mr. John&s;on was allowed fifteen pence, per day, on account of a Lieutenant's commi&s;&s;ion, which he held under George the &s;econd, and I was permitted to go once a week into the city to purcha&s;e nec|e&s;&s;aries; and a wa&s;herwoman was provided for my u&s;e. We were not confined to the narrow limits of a &s;ingle room, but were re&s;trained only by the bounds of the jail yard. Our &s;ituation formed &s;uch a contra&s;t, with what we endured in the gloomy criminal jail, that we imagined our&s;elves the favorites of fortune, and in high life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII Re&s;idence in the Civil Jail, and occurrences till the twentieth of July, 1757.</HEAD>
<P>TO be indolent from nece&s;&s;ity, has ever been deemed a formidable evil. No better witne&s;&s;es than our&s;elves, can te&s;tify the truth of the remark, although, our lodgings were now &s;uch as we envied a month before, yet, to be compelled to continual idlene&s;s, was grievous to be borne. We derived &s;ome amu&s;ement, from the cultivation of a &s;mall garden, within the jail yard; but a continued &s;amene&s;s of friends and action, rendered our time extremely weari&s;ome.</P>
<P>ABOUT a month after our arrival at this new abode, one Captain Milton, with
<PB N="109" REF="030180_0109_0FE4C2D5BB1824B0">
his crew, who, with their ve&s;&s;el, were taken at &s;ea, were brought pri&s;oners of war to the &s;ame place. Milton was lodged in our apartment; he had all the rude boi&s;t|erous airs of a &s;eaman; without the lea&s;t trait of a gentleman, which rendered him a very trouble&s;ome companion. His im|pudence was con&s;ummate, but that was not the greate&s;t evil; while &s;ome new re|cruits were parading before the pri&s;on, one day, Milton addre&s;&s;ed them in very im|proper language, from our window, which was noticed directly by city authority, who, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be Mr. John&s;on, ordered him into the dungeon. Deeply affected, by this new trouble, I again called on my friend, Mr. Pertua, who, after having a&s;|certained the facts, got him relea&s;ed. Mr. Milton was then put into other quarters.</P>
<P>A new jailer, who had an agreeable la|dy for his wife, now made our &s;ituation
<PB N="110" REF="030180_0110_0FE4C2DCA71ABA18">
&s;till more happy. My little daughters played with hers, and learned the French language.</P>
<P>CAPT. M'Neil, and his brother, from Bo&s;ton, were brought to us as pri&s;oners; they told us the &s;tate of politicks, in our own country, and told us &s;ome intere&s;ting news, about &s;ome of our friends at home.</P>
<P>IN the morning of the thirteenth of Augu&s;t, our jailer, with moon eyes, came to congratulate us, on the taking of O&s;we|go, by the French. We entered little into his &s;pirit of joy, preferring much, to hear good news from the other &s;ide. We were &s;oon vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the pri&s;oners, who had &s;urrendered. Col. Schuyler was in the number, who, with the gentlemen in his &s;uit, made us a generous pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE remainder of the &s;ummer and fall,
<PB N="111" REF="030180_0111_0FE4C2DE2C6FDAC0">
of fifty &s;ix, pa&s;&s;ed off without any &s;en&s;ible variation. We frequently heard from Montreal my &s;i&s;ter was very well &s;ituated, in the family of the Lieut. Governor, and my elde&s;t daughter was care&s;&s;ed by her three mothers. Could I have heard from my &s;on, half my trouble would have ended.</P>
<P>IN December, I was delivered of a &s;on, which lived but a few hours, and was bur|ied under the Cathedral Church.</P>
<P>IN the winter, I received a letter from my &s;i&s;ter, containing the &s;ad tidings of my father's death, who was killed by Indians, on his own farm, the preceding May. Savage vengeance fell heavily upon our family; I had a brother wounded at the &s;ame time, who ran to the fort, with the &s;pear &s;ticking in his thigh. Too much grief reduced me to a weak condition; I
<PB N="112" REF="030180_0112_0FE4C2DFB11D3248">
was taken &s;ick, and carried to the ho&s;pital, where, after a month's lingering illne&s;s, I found my&s;elf able to return.</P>
<P>THE commencement of the year fifty &s;even, pa&s;&s;ed off without a pro&s;pect of lib|erty. Part of our fellow pri&s;oners, were &s;ent to France, but we made no voyage out of the jail yard. About the fir&s;t of May, we petitioned Mon&s;. Vaudrieul, to permit our &s;i&s;ter to come to us. Our prayer was granted, and in May, we had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, after an ab|&s;ence of two years. She had &s;upported her&s;elf by her needle, in the family of the Lieut. Governor, where &s;he was treated extremely well, and received a pre&s;ent of four crowns at parting.</P>
<P>IMPATIENT of confinement, we now made another attempt to gain our liberty. Mr. Pertua conducted us to the hou&s;e of
<PB N="113" REF="030180_0113_0FE4C2E263316640">
the Lord Intendant, to whom we petition|ed in pre&s;&s;ing terms; &s;tating that we had now been pri&s;oners almo&s;t three years, and had &s;uffered every thing but death; and that would be our &s;peedy portion, unle&s;s we had relief. His Lord&s;hip li&s;ten|ed with &s;eeming pity, and promi&s;ed to lay our ca&s;e before the head man, at Mon|treal, and give us an an&s;wer, in &s;even days; at the expiration of which time, we had a permit to leave the pri&s;on. It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the effect of &s;uch news; tho&s;e only, who have felt the hor|rors of confinement, can figure to them|&s;elves, the happine&s;s we enjoyed, when breathing, once more, the air of liberty. We took lodgings in town, where we tar|ried till the fir&s;t of June; when a cartel &s;hip arrived, to carry pri&s;oners to En|gland, for an exchange. Mr. John&s;on wrote an urgent letter, to Mon&s;. Vau|drieul, praying that his family might be
<PB N="114" REF="030180_0114_0FE4C2EA02653090">
included with tho&s;e, who were to take pa&s;|&s;age. Mon&s;ieur wrote a very encourag|ing letter back, promi&s;ing that he and his family &s;hould &s;ail, and that his daughter, Su&s;anna, &s;hould be &s;ent to him&mdash;he con|cluded, by congratulating him on his good pro&s;pects, and ordering the Governor of Quebec to afford us his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This letter was dated June the 27th.</P>
<P>THIS tide of good fortune almo&s;t wip|ed away the remembrance of three years adver&s;ity. We began our preparations for embarkation, with alacrity. Mr. John|&s;on wrote St. Luc Lucorne, for the &s;even hundred livres, due on Mr. Cuyler's or|der, but his reque&s;t was, and &s;till is, un|&s;atisfied. This was a period, big with every thing propitious and happy. The idea of leaving a country, where I had &s;uffered the keene&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, during two months and a half, with the &s;avages&mdash;been
<PB N="115" REF="030180_0115_0FE4C2EB9CD800B0">
bowed down by every mortification and in&s;ult, which could ari&s;e from the misfor|tunes of my husband in New-England; and, where I had &s;pent two years in &s;ickne&s;s and de&s;pair, in a pri&s;on too &s;hocking to mention, contributed to fill the moment with all the happine&s;s, which the benevo|lent reader will conceive my due, after &s;ufferings &s;o inten&s;e; to con&s;ummate the whole, my daughter was to be returned to my arms, who had been ab&s;ent more than two years.&mdash;There was a good pro&s;pect of our &s;on's being relea&s;ed from the In|dians; the whole, formed &s;uch a lucky combination of fortunate events, that the danger of twice cro&s;&s;ing the ocean, to gain our native &s;hore, vani&s;hed in a moment. My family were all in the &s;ame joyful mood, and hailed the happy day, when we &s;hould &s;ail for England.</P>
<P>BUT little did we think, that this &s;un|&s;hine
<PB N="116" REF="030180_0116_0FE4C2ED21431360">
of pro&s;perity was &s;o &s;oon to be darkened, by the heavie&s;t clouds of mis|fortune. Three days before the appoint|ed day for &s;ailing, the &s;hip came down from Montreal, without my daughter; in a few moments, I met Mr. Pertua, who told me, that counter orders had come, and Mr. John&s;on mu&s;t be retained a pri&s;|oner; only my two little daughters, &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf could go. This was calamity indeed; to attempt &s;uch a long, weari&s;ome voyage, without money, and without ac|quaintance, and to leave a hu&s;band, and two children in the hands of enemies, was too abhorrent for reflection. But is was an affair of importance, and required weighty con&s;ideration; accordingly, the next day a &s;olemn council, of all the pri&s;|oners in the city, was held in the coffee hou&s;e.&mdash;Col. Schuyler was pre&s;ident, and, after numerous arguments, for and again&s;t, were heard, it was voted, by a large ma|jority,
<PB N="117" REF="030180_0117_0FE4C2EEA520CA90">
that I &s;hould go.&mdash;I, with he&s;ita|tion, gave my con&s;ent. Some, perhaps, will cen&s;ure the mea&s;ure, as ra&s;h, and oth|ers may applaud my courage; but I had &s;o long been accu&s;tomed to danger and di&s;tre&s;s, in the mo&s;t menacing forms, they could a&s;&s;ume, that I was now almo&s;t in|&s;en&s;ible to their threats; and this act was not a little bia&s;&s;ed by de&s;peration. Life could no longer retain its value, if linger|ed out in the inimical regions of Canada. In Europe, I &s;hould, at lea&s;t, find friends, if not acquaintance; and among the nume|rous ve&s;&s;els bound to America, I might chance to get a pa&s;&s;age. But then, to leave a tender hu&s;band, who had &s;o long, at the hazard of his life, pre&s;erved my own; to part, perhaps forever, from two children, put all my re&s;olution to the te&s;t, and &s;hook my boa&s;ted firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>COL. Schuyler, whom we ever found

our benevolent friend, promi&s;ed to u&s;e his influence, for Mr. John&s;on's relea&s;e, and for the redemption of our children.</P>
<P>ON the twentieth of July, we went on board the ve&s;&s;el, accompanied by Mr. John&s;on, who went with us to take leave. We were introduced to the Captain, who was a gentleman, and a per&s;on of great civility;&mdash;he &s;hewed us the be&s;t cabin, which was to be the place of our re&s;idence, and, after promi&s;ing my hu&s;band, that the voyage &s;hould be made as agreeable to me as po&s;&s;ible, he gave orders for weigh|ing anchor.&mdash;The time was now come, that we mu&s;t part&mdash;Mr. John&s;on took me by the hand&mdash;our tears impo&s;ed &s;ilence&mdash; I &s;aw him &s;tep into the barge;&mdash;but my two little children, &s;i&s;ter, and my&s;elf, were bound for Europe.</P>
<P>WE fell down the river St. Lawrence,
<PB N="119" REF="030180_0119_0FE4C2F8EF27ABA8">
but a &s;mall di&s;tance that night. The next morning, the Captain, with a cheerful countenance, came to our cabin, and in|vited us to ri&s;e, and take our leave of Que|bec; none but my&s;elf complied, and I gazed, as long as &s;ight would permit, at the place, where I had left my deare&s;t friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Voyage to Plymouth. Occurrences. Sail|ing from Plymouth to Port&s;mouth, from thence, by the way of Cork, to Newyork.</HEAD>
<P>ALL my fears and affliction, did not prevent my feeling &s;ome little joy, at being relea&s;ed from the juri&s;diction of Frenchmen. I could pardon the Indians, for their vindictive &s;pirit, becau&s;e they had no claim to the benefits of civilization. But the French, who give le&s;&s;ons of po|litene&s;s, to the re&s;t of the world, can de|rive no advantage from the plea of igno|rance. The blind &s;uper&s;tition, which is inculcated by their monks and friars, doubtle&s;s, &s;tifles, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the ex|ertion of pity towards their enemies; and the common herd, which includes al|mo&s;t
<PB N="121" REF="030180_0121_0FE4C2FCF1172380">
&s;even eighths of their number, have no advantages from education. To the&s;e &s;ources, I attribute mo&s;t of my &s;ufferings. But I found &s;ome benevolent friends, who&s;e genero&s;ity I &s;hall ever recollect, with the warme&s;t gratitude.</P>
<P>THE commencement of the voyage, had every favorable pre&s;age; the weather was fine, the &s;ailors cheerful, and the &s;hip in good trim. My accommodations in the Captain's family, were very commodious; a boy was allowed me, for my particular u&s;e. We &s;ailed with excellent fortune, till the nineteenth of Augu&s;t, when we hove in &s;ight of old Plymouth, and at four o'clock, in the afternoon, dropped anchor.</P>
<P>THE next day, all but my&s;elf and fam|ily, were taken from the ve&s;&s;el; we felt great anxiety at being left, and began to
<PB N="122" REF="030180_0122_0FE4C303F708AB38">
fear, that fortune was not willing to &s;mile on us, even on the&s;e &s;hores; we waited in de&s;pair, thirty or forty hours, and found no relief. The Captain, ob&s;erving our de|&s;pondency, began his airs of gaiety to cheer us; he a&s;&s;ured us, that we &s;hould not &s;uffer&mdash;that if the Engli&s;h would not receive us, he would take us to France, and make us happy. But, at la&s;t an officer came on board, to &s;ee if the ve&s;&s;el was pre|pared for the reception of French pri&s;on|ers. We related to him our &s;ituation; he conducted us on &s;hore, and applied to the Admiral for directions&mdash;who ordered us lodgings, and the King's allowance of two &s;hillings &s;terling, per day, for our &s;upport. Fortunately, we were lodged in a hou&s;e, where re&s;ided Captain John Tu&s;ton Ma|&s;on, who&s;e name will be familiar to the inhabitants of Newhamp&s;hire, on account of his patent. He very kindly intere&s;ted him&s;elf in our favor, and wrote to Me&s;&s;rs.

Thomlin&s;on and Apthorp, agents at Lon|don, for the Province of Newhamp&s;hire, &s;oliciting their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in my behalf. We tarried at Plymouth but a fortnight, during which time, I received much atten|tion, and had to gratify many an inqui&s;i|tive friend, with the hi&s;tory of my &s;uffer|ings.</P>
<P>CAPT. Ma&s;on procured me a pa&s;&s;age to Port&s;mouth, in the Rainbow man of war, from whence I was to take pa&s;&s;age in a packet, for America. Ju&s;t as I &s;tepped on board the Rainbow, a good lady, with her &s;on, came to make me a vi&s;it; her cu|rio&s;ity to &s;ee a per&s;on of my de&s;cription, was not abated, by my being on my pa&s;|&s;age; &s;he &s;aid &s;he could not &s;leep, till &s;he had &s;een the per&s;on, who had &s;uffered &s;uch hard fortune.&mdash;After &s;he had a&s;ked all the que&s;tions that time would allow of, &s;he gave me a guinea, and a half guinea

to my &s;i&s;ter, and a mu&s;lin handkerchief to each of my little girls. On our arrival at Port&s;mouth, the packet had &s;ailed; the Captain of the Rainbow, not finding it convenient to keep us with him, introduc|ed us on board the Royal Ann.</P>
<P>WHEREVER we lived, we found the be&s;t friends and the polite&s;t treatment.&mdash; It will be thought &s;ingular, that a defence|le&s;s woman, &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o many changes, without meeting with &s;ome in&s;ults, and many incivilities. But, during my long re&s;idence on board the various ve&s;&s;els, the mo&s;t delicate gallantry ever de&s;ignated my companions. The officers were a&s;&s;iduous in making my &s;ituation agreeable, and readily proffered their &s;ervices.</P>

<P>LATE la&s;t po&s;tnight, I received an an|&s;wer from Mr. Apthorp, who is partner with Mr. Thomlin&s;on, the agent for New|hamp&s;hire, with a letter enclo&s;ed to you, which gave you liberty to draw on him for fifteen guineas. As Madam Hornech was ju&s;t clo&s;ing her letter to you, I gave it her, to enclo&s;e for you, I now write a|gain to London, in your behalf. You mu&s;t immediately write Mr. Apthorp, what you intend to do, and what further you would have him, and our friends at London, do for you.</P>

<P>I received the donation, and Mr. Ap|thorp &s;ent me the fifteen guineas. I &s;in|cerely lament, that he omitted &s;ending me the names of my benefactors.</P>
<P>THE Captain of the Royal Ann, &s;up|po&s;ing my &s;ituation with him, might not be &s;o convenient, applied to the mayor, for a permit for me to take lodgings in the city, which was granted. I took new lodgings, where I tarried three or four days, when orders came for me to be on board the Orange, man of war, in three
<PB N="129" REF="030180_0129_0FE4C3163B327EC8">
hours, which was to &s;ail for America. We made all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, but when we got to the &s;hore, we were a&s;toni&s;hed to find the &s;hip too far under way, to be o|vertaken. No time was to be lo&s;t, I ap|plied to a waterman, to carry us to a mer|chantman, who was weighing anchor, at a di&s;tance, to go in the &s;ame fleet. He he&s;itated long enough to pronounce a chapter of oaths, and rowed us off. When we came to the ve&s;&s;el, I petitioned the Captain to take us on board, till he over|took the Orange. He directly flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and offered greater in|&s;ults, than I had ever received, during my whole voyage; he &s;wore we were women of bad fame, who wi&s;hed to follow the ar|my, and that he would have nothing to do with us. I begged him to calm his rage, and we would convince him of his error. But, fortunately, the victualler of the fleet happened to be in the &s;hip, who
<PB N="130" REF="030180_0130_0FE4C31D5C2B4DC0">
at this moment &s;tepped forward, with his roll of names, and told the outrageous Captain, that he would &s;oon convince him, whether we de&s;erved notice, by &s;earching his li&s;t. He &s;oon found our names, and the Captain began to beg pardon.&mdash;He took us on board, and apologized for his rude|ne&s;s. We &s;ailed with a fair wind for Cork, where the fleet took provi&s;ion. We tarri|ed a fortnight in this place, during which time, the Captain of the Orange came on board to &s;ee me, and to offer me a birth in his ve&s;&s;el; but that being a battle &s;hip, it was thought be&s;t for me to &s;tay where I then was. After weighing anchor at Cork, we had a pa&s;&s;age of &s;even weeks, remarka|bly plea&s;ant, to Newyork. On the tenth of December, we dropped anchor at San|dy Hook; on the eleventh, I had the &s;u|preme felicity, to find my&s;elf on &s;hore in my native country, after an ab&s;ence of three years, three months, and eleven days.</P>

<P>I MIGHT de&s;cant for many a page, on the felicity I felt, on being once more in my own country; but others can gue&s;s my feelings better than I can tell them. The Mayor of Newyork, ordered lodgings for us; here I had the plea&s;ure of meeting my friend, Col. Schuyler, who gave me much information about affairs in Canada, he told me that my hu&s;band had been relea&s;ed, and taken pa&s;&s;age in a cartel &s;hip, for Halifax; and that he had redeemed my &s;on from the Indians, for the &s;um of five hundred livres.</P>
<P>MY fellow pri&s;oner, Labarree, had made his e&s;cape from the French, and had been
<PB N="132" REF="030180_0132_0FE4C320669D96F0">
in Newyork a few days before, on his way home.</P>
<P>WE tarried in Newyork ten days&mdash;then took water pa&s;&s;age for Newhaven, where I had the good fortune to find a number of officers who had been &s;tationed at Charle&s;|town, the preceding &s;ummer, who gratifi|ed my curio&s;ity with intelligence re&s;pect|ing my relations and friends in that place. Some of the&s;e gentlemen, among whom was Col. Whiting, kindly undertook to a&s;|&s;i&s;t us on our journey home, by the way of Springfield. At Hartford we found &s;ome gentlemen who were bound for Charle&s;town; they &s;olicited my &s;i&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;s Miriam Willard, was afterwards married to the Reverend Mr. Whitney, of Shirley, Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts.</NOTE> to go in company with them, which &s;he a&s;&s;ented to.</P>

Fortunately, Mr. John&s;on about the &s;ame time arrived at Bo&s;ton, but misfortune had not yet fill|ed the mea&s;ure of his calamity. He had no &s;ooner landed, than he was put un|der guard, on &s;u&s;picion of not performing his duty in the redemption of the Canada pri&s;oners, which &s;u&s;picion was occa&s;ioned by his remi&s;ne&s;s in producing his vouchers.

<P><PB N="135" REF="030180_0135_0FE4C32B9B428018">AFTER his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, from the guards in Bo&s;ton, he proceeded directly for Charle&s;town. When within fifteen miles of Springfield, he was met by a gentleman, who had ju&s;t before &s;een me, who gave him the be&s;t news he could have heard; although, it was then late at night, he lo&s;t not a moment.&mdash;At two o'clock, in the morning of the fir&s;t of January 1758, I a|gain embraced my deare&s;t friend&mdash;happy new year, with plea&s;ure would I de&s;cribe my emotions of joy, could language paint them &s;ufficiently forcible; but the feeble pen &s;hrinks from the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>CHARLESTOWN was &s;till a frontier town, and &s;uffered from &s;avage depreda|tions, which rendered it an improper re&s;i|dence for me; con&s;equently I went to Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>MR. John&s;on, in a few days, &s;at out for Newyork, to adju&s;t his Canada accounts.
<PB N="136" REF="030180_0136_0FE4C32D215DA040">
But, on his journey, he was per&s;uaded by Gov. Pownal to take a Captain's commi&s;|&s;ion, and join the forces, bound for Ticon|deroga; where he was killed on the 8th of July following, while fighting for his country. Humanity will weep with me. The cup of &s;orrow, was now replete with bitter drops. All my former mi&s;eries were lo&s;t in the affliction of the widow.</P>
<P>IN the October following, I had the happine&s;s to embrace rny &s;on Sylvanus; he had been above three years with the Indians, followed them in all their hunt|ing excur&s;ions and learnt too many of their habits; to civilize him, and learn him his native language was a &s;evere ta&s;k.</P>
<P>I lived in Lanca&s;ter till October 1759, when I returned to old Charle&s;town.&mdash; The &s;ight of my former re&s;idence afforded a &s;trange mixture of joy and grief, while
<PB N="137" REF="030180_0137_0FE4C32FA78D1770">
the de&s;olations of war, and the lo&s;s of a number of dear and valuable friends, com|bined to give the place an air of melan|choly. Soon after my arrival, Major Rogers returned from an expedition again&s;t the village St. Francis, which he had de&s;troy|ed and killed mo&s;t of the inhabitants. He brought with him a young Indian pri&s;on|er, who &s;topped at my hou&s;e, the moment he &s;aw me, he cried, my God, my God here is my &s;i&s;ter; it was my little brother Sabatis, who formerly u&s;ed to bring the cows for me, when I lived at my Indian ma&s;ters. He was tran&s;ported to &s;ee me, and declared that he was &s;till my brother, and I mu&s;t be his &s;i&s;ter. Poor fellow! The fortune of war had left him without a &s;ingle relation, but with his country's enemies, he could find one who too &s;en&s;i|bly felt his mi&s;eries; I felt the pure&s;t plea&s;ure in admini&s;tering to his comfort.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="030180_0138_0FE4C336AF9B9388">MY daughter Su&s;anna, was &s;till in Can|ada&mdash;but as I had the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urances that every attention was paid to her edu|cation and welfare, by her three mothers, I felt le&s;s anxiety than I otherwi&s;e might have done.</P>
<P>EVERY one will imagine, that I have paid affliction her utmo&s;t demand, the pains of impri&s;onment, the &s;eparation from my children, the keen &s;orrow occa&s;ioned by the death of a butchered father, and the &s;evere grief ari&s;ing from my hu&s;band's death, will amount to a &s;um, perhaps, un|equaled. But &s;till my family mu&s;t be doomed to further, and &s;evere per&s;ecu|tions, from the &s;avages. In the com|mencement of the &s;ummer of &s;eventeen hundred and &s;ixty, my brother in law, Mr. Jo&s;eph Willard, with his wife and five children, who lived but two miles di&s;|tant from me, were taken by a party of
<PB N="139" REF="030180_0139_0FE4C338353FC278">
Indians. They were carried much the &s;ame rout that I was, to Montreal. Their journey of fourteen days, through the wil|derne&s;s, was a &s;eries of mi&s;eries, unknown to any but tho&s;e who &s;uffered with me, they lo&s;t two children, who&s;e deaths were owing to &s;avage barbarity. The hi&s;tory of their captivity would almo&s;t equal my own, but the reader's commi&s;eration and pity mu&s;t now be exhau&s;ted. No more of angui&s;h, no more of &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>THEY arrived at Montreal, a few days before the French &s;urrendered it to the Engli&s;h; and after four Month's ab&s;ence, returned home, and brought my daughter Su&s;anna to my arms; while I rejoiced at again meeting my child, whom I had not &s;een for above four years, I felt extremely grateful to the Mrs. Jai&s;&s;ons, for the af|fectionate attention they had be&s;towed her. As they had received her as their
<PB N="140" REF="030180_0140_0FE4C339B937DF78">
child, they had made their affluent for|tune &s;ub&s;ervient to her be&s;t intere&s;t. To give her the accompli&s;hments of a polite education had been their principal care, &s;he had contracted an ardent love for them, which never will be obliterated. Their parting was an affecting &s;cene of tears.</P>
<P>MR. Farn&s;worth, my only fellow pri&s;on|er who&s;e return I have not mentioned, came home a little before.</P>
<P>THUS, by the goodne&s;s of Providence, we all returned in the cour&s;e of &s;ix pain|ful years, to the place from whence we were taken. The long period of our cap|tivity, and the &s;everity of our &s;ufferings, will be called uncommon and unprece|dented. But we even found &s;ome friends to pity, among our mo&s;t per&s;ecuting ene|mies; and from the various &s;hapes, in which mankind appeared, we learned ma|ny
<PB N="141" REF="030180_0141_0FE4C33C3B116238">
valuable le&s;&s;ons. Whether in the wilds of Canada, the horrid jails of Quebec, or in our voyage to Europe, daily occur|rences happened, to convince us, that the pa&s;&s;ions of men are as various as their complexions. And, although my &s;uffer|ings were often increa&s;ed by the &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s of this world's &s;pirit, yet the numerous te&s;timonies of genero&s;ity I received, bids me &s;uppre&s;s the charge of neglect, or want of benevolence. That I have been an un|fortunate woman, all will grant; yet, my misfortunes, while they enriched my ex|perience, and taught me the value of pa|tience, have increa&s;ed my gratitude to the author of all ble&s;&s;ings, who&s;e goodne&s;s and mercy have pre&s;erved my life to the pre&s;|ent time.</P>
<P>I am now in the winter of life, and feel &s;en&s;ibly the effects of old age, my vacant hours I often employ in reflecting on the
<PB N="142" REF="030180_0142_0FE4C342E7F3C0B0">
various &s;cenes, that have marked the dif|ferent &s;tages of my life. When viewing the pre&s;ent ri&s;ing generation, in the bloom of health, and enjoying tho&s;e gay plea&s;|ures which &s;hed their exhilerating influ|ence, &s;o plentifully in the morn of life, I look back to my early days, when I too was happy, and ba&s;ked in the &s;un&s;hine of good fortune: Little do they think, that the meridian of their lives, can po&s;&s;ibly be rendered mi&s;erable by captivity or a pri&s;|on; as little too did I think, that my gild|ed pro&s;pects could be ob&s;cured, but it was the happy delu&s;ion of youth; and I fer|vently wi&s;h there was no deception. But that Being, who "&s;its upon the circle of the earth, and views the inhabitants as gra&s;shoppers," allots our fortunes.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH I have drank &s;o largely, from the cup of &s;orrow, yet my pre&s;ent happine&s;s is a &s;mall compen&s;ation. Twice
<PB N="143" REF="030180_0143_0FE4C3448EC2C730">
has my country been ravaged by war, &s;ince my remembrance; I have detailed the &s;hare I bore in the fir&s;t; in the la&s;t, al|though the place in which I live, was not a field of bloody battle, yet its vicinity to Ticonderoga, and the &s;avages that ravaged the Coos country, rendered it perilous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. But now, no one can &s;et a higher value on the &s;miles of peace, than my&s;elf. The &s;avages are driven beyond the Lakes, and our country has no ene|mies. The gloomy wilderne&s;s, that forty years ago, &s;ecreted the Indian and the bea&s;t of prey, has vani&s;hed away; and the thrifty farm &s;miles in its &s;tead; the &s;un|days, that were then employed in guard|ing a fort, are now quietly devoted to wor|&s;hip; the tomahawk and &s;calping knife, have given place to the &s;ickle and plough|&s;hare; and pro&s;perous hu&s;bandry now thrives, where the terrors of death once chilled us with fear.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="030180_0144_0FE4C34613BFB9A0">MY numerous progeny, often gather a|round me, to hear the &s;ufferings once felt by their aunt or grandmother, and wonder at their magnitude. My daughter, Cap|tive, &s;till keeps the dre&s;s &s;he appeared in, when brought to my bed &s;ide, by the French nur&s;e, at the Ticonderoga ho&s;pi|tal; and often refre&s;hes my memory with pa&s;t &s;cenes, when &s;howing it to her chil|dren. The&s;e things yield a kind of mel|ancholy plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>INSTANCES of longevity are remarkable in my family. My aged mother &s;ays to me, ari&s;e daughter and go to thy daughter, for your daughter's daughter, has got a daughter; a command which few mothers can make and be obeyed.</P>
