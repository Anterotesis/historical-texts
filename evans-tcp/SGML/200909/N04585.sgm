<P>THE Apo&s;tle having in the fir&s;t Ver&s;e of this Chapter, affectionately Ex|horted the believing <HI>Romans,</HI> to Ho|line&s;s in general; does more parti|ticularly in the following Ver&s;es, di&s;&s;wade them from two Evils which are great Hin|drances thereof, <HI>viz. Conformity to the &s;inful Cu&s;toms of the World,</HI> and <HI>high Thoughts of their own Attainments.</HI> It is the la&s;t of the&s;e which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks again&s;t in the Words of our Text, <HI>For I &s;ay through the Grace given unto me: i. e.</HI> I require and enjoyn you, by the Authority that God has graciou&s;ly given me as an Apo&s;tle, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 10.</NOTE> <HI>to every Man that is among you: i. e.</HI> To one as well as another: As if the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid; I addre&s;s you all, my

Brethren, as if I particularly mentioned your Names; I except none of any Condition or Character, for you all need the Injunction, <HI>not to think of him&s;elf more highly than he ought to think: i. e.</HI> Not to be proud or puffed up with overweening extravagant Conceits of his Endowments and Attain|ments, &s;uch as wi&s;dom, ability, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to think &s;oberly, <HI>i. e.</HI> mode&s;tly; <Q>let him contain him&s;elf within Bounds, and not take upon him what doth not belong to him; let him not contemn others, and pretend to more than he hath. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Pool</HI>'s Annotations</NOTE></Q> <HI>As God hath dealt to every Man the Mea&s;ure of Faith.</HI> By Faith the Apo&s;tle doubtle&s;s intends, &s;pi|ritual Gifts, which are called Faith, becau&s;e they are given with it, and exercis'd by it.

Mea&s;ure of our Talents, imagining them to be much greater than they are; for tho' that may flatter our Arrogance, yet it betrays our Ignorance and Weakne&s;s; it is as inju|rious to our Honour among the Intelligent, as it is prejudicial to our U&s;efulne&s;s in the World. It is &s;urely a great In&s;tance of true Wi&s;dom, to think &s;oberly of our &s;elves; and hence the original Word <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sophronein.</NOTE> in our Text, &s;ignifies <HI>to be wi&s;e to &s;obriety.</HI> Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, That there is an elegant Paranoma&s;ia, (or &s;ymphony of Sounds) in this Place of Scripture in the <HI>Greek,</HI> which our Language cannot reach. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Me uperphronein, par O Dei phronein alla phronein, eis to Sophronein.</NOTE></P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid I would ob&s;erve, That even good Men are in great Danger of &s;piritual Pride, and of being puffed up for a Time with groundle&s;s and fooli&s;h Conceits of their Attainments. If this was not the Ca&s;e, there wou'd have been no Need of the Injunction in our Text; nether wou'd their have been any Nece&s;&s;ity of a Me&s;&s;en|ger of Satan &s;ent to buffet <HI>Paul,</HI> lea&s;t he &s;hould be lifted up thro' the Abundance of Reve|lations that were given him.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005696_0005_1026C150F4E03588">In Di&s;cour&s;ing upon this Subject, I &s;hall &s;peak upon the <HI>Nature, Ingredients, Cau&s;es, Fruits</HI> and <HI>Cure of &s;piritual Pride.</HI></P>
<P>Now Pride, as to its general Nature, may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is a ground|le&s;s Conceit of our Attainments, accompa|nied with an inordinate De&s;ire of our own Honour and Contempt of our Neighbour's Excellencies and Credit.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t: High-Mindedne&s;s,</HI> which is the Loftine&s;s or Swelling of the Mind with un|rea&s;onable Self-Conceit. When Per&s;ons have too high Thoughts of their Powers and Talents, and are hereby di&s;po&s;ed to over-value them&s;elves and undervalue others; this is as natural to Mankind as it is unrea&s;onable in it &s;elf, and fatal in its Con&s;equnces. A|gain&s;t this pernicious Evil, the Text I am di&s;cour&s;ing upon is expre&s;ly Directed. This is indeed the bitter Root, the poy&s;onous Fountain from which the other &s;inful Ingredi|ents gra&s;p'd in &s;piritual Pride (which I &s;hall anon mention) do flow. Again&s;t this the A|po&s;tle

<HI>Paul</HI> excellently cautions the Gentile Churches, in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 20.</NOTE> in the following Words: <HI>Well, becau&s;e of Unbelief they were broken off;</HI> (meaning the <HI>Jews) and thou &s;tande&s;t by Faith. Be not high minded but fear.</HI> Now altho' gracious Per&s;ons may for a Time be carried away with High-Mindedne&s;s, thro' the Violence of Temptation; yet to be under the Habi|tual or general Government of it, is certain|ly an Evidence of a bad State towards God. This the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ures us of in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot" N="&Dagger;">2 Tim. iii. 3, 4.</NOTE> in the&s;e Words: <HI>With|out natural Affection, truce Breakers, fal&s;e Accu&s;ers, incontinent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good, Traytors, Heady, high Minded, Lovers of Plea&s;ures more than Lovers of God.</HI> Upon the&s;e Words, <HI>viz. heady, high-minded,</HI> Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> thus glo&s;&s;eth: <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Pool's <HI>Annotations</HI> in loc.</NOTE> <Q>Ra&s;h, incon|&s;iderate, blown up as Bladders with an Opinion of their own De&s;erts.</Q> You may ob&s;erve in the Ver&s;es now quoted, that the Apo&s;tle puts high-minded Per&s;ons in the &s;ame Catalogue with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, and declares that they love not

God tran&s;cendently. Surely tho&s;e that are renewed by the Holy Gho&s;t, do <HI>learn of Je&s;us to be meek and lowly</HI> in their habitu|al Temper of Mind and outward Behaviour. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xi. 29.</NOTE> They are made to <HI>receive the Kingdom of Heaven as little Children,</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 17.</NOTE> <HI>are Fools</HI> in their own Eyes; <NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 18.</NOTE> and in compari&s;on of many others, they &s;ometimes &s;ee them&s;elves to be in re&s;pect of Knowledge, <HI>but as brute Bea&s;ts.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Colo|&s;&s;ians,</HI> <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Colo&s;&s;. ii. 18.</NOTE> ju&s;tly Terms high-mindedne&s;s, to be the <HI>puffing up of a Per&s;on, vainly by his fle&s;hly Mind;</HI> probably alluding to Liquors &s;welling by the Ye&s;t into Spume and Froth, which has a Shew but no Solidity. For indeed, Pride is to the Mind of Man, in re&s;pect of Agitation and Tumor, as Ye&s;t is to Liquors.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> Another <HI>Ingredient</HI> in &s;piritual Pride is <HI>Ambition,</HI> which is an inordinate Seeking of Dignity, or high Places; proud Per&s;ons have a&s;piring Thoughts, and ima|gine them&s;elves to be the fitte&s;t to manage the Helm of the State, or the Church; and if
<PB N="9" REF="005696_0008_1026C158B9631210">
others don't think &s;o, they are not well pleas'd; they cannot bear to have others preferred before them, altho' the Preference be ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. Something of this &s;inful Temper appear'd in the Apo&s;tles Conduct, before the extraordinary Effu&s;ion of the Holy Spirit at Penteco&s;t; <HI>there was al&s;o a Strife among them which of them &s;hould be accounted the Greate&s;t.</HI> This our Lord &s;ea&s;onably oppo&s;ed, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 24, 25, 26.</NOTE> and for what we can learn, it &s;oon evani&s;h'd. But when a Love of Preheminence among the Brethren is habitual as well as inordinate, and attend|ed with a <HI>malicious pratting</HI> again&s;t the faithful Servants of Chri&s;t, on the Account of &s;mall Differences in Sentiment or Prac|tice, which &s;eems to have been the Ca&s;e of <HI>Diotrephes,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> informs us, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">3 Epi&s;t. 9, 10.</NOTE> it is an awful Sign of a bad State! But to proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly:</HI> Another <HI>Ingredient</HI> in &s;piritual Pride is <HI>Arrogance;</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in pre|tending to what we have not, and in de&s;ir|ing that others &s;hould think of us above what we are or have; this was the Practice
<PB N="10" REF="005696_0009_1026C15A43953C80">
of the fal&s;e Teachers who troubled the Church of <HI>Corinth;</HI> they commended them|&s;elves by boa&s;ting of Things beyond their Mea&s;ure, hereby &s;eeking to le&s;&s;en their E&s;teem of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> and other &s;ound Preach|ers. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 10,&mdash;12, 13.</NOTE> The very contrary whereof he de|termined &s;hou'd be the Mea&s;ure of his Con|duct: <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>For we dare not,</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>make our &s;elves of the Number, or compare our &s;elves with &s;ome that commend them&s;elves.&mdash; But we will not boa&s;t of Things without our Mea&s;ure, but according to the Mea&s;ure of the Rule which God hath di&s;tributed to us.</HI> This leads me</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly:</HI> To another particular included in &s;piritual Pride, which is <HI>boa&s;ting</HI> of the <HI>Gifts</HI> or <HI>Graces</HI> which we really have: Proud Per&s;ons and Boa&s;ters are put together in the &s;ame Cla&s;s by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his E|pi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 30.</NOTE> thus, <HI>Backbiters, haters, of God, de&s;piteful, Proud, Boa&s;ters.</HI> Proud Per&s;ons are full of Blaze and O&s;ten|tation about their Attainments; they take up much of their Time in trumpeting their own Prai&s;es, either more openly or covertly,
<PB N="11" REF="005696_0010_1026C15D9BD970B8">
and wou'd have all to admire them without Cau&s;e, as they do them&s;elves. But this low Artifice, procures not for them the E&s;teem and Re&s;pect they de&s;ire and De&s;ign from the Judicious, but the Contrary.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly:</HI> Another <HI>Ingredient</HI> in &s;piritual Pride is, <HI>Contempt</HI> of, and <HI>Envy</HI> again&s;t o|thers <HI>Excellencies,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;tand in our Light and &s;eem to dimini&s;h our Lu&s;tre. This the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> confirms <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. iv. 5, 6.</NOTE> in the following Words: <HI>Do ye think that the Scripture &s;ayeth in vain, the Spirit that dwelleth in us lu&s;teth to Envy.</HI>&mdash;Wherefore he &s;ayeth, <HI>God re&s;i&s;teth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the Humble.</HI> As much as we over|value our own Attainments, &s;o much will we be enclined to undervalue others, that &s;o we may Triumph in an imaginary A&s;&s;en|dant over them. But this Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind is very Di&s;plea&s;ing to God and detri|mental to us; and hence <HI>Solomon</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that the Almighty &s;corneth the Scorners, but giveth Grace unto the lowly.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. iii. 34.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly:</HI> Another <HI>Ingredient</HI> is <HI>Pre&s;ump|tion,</HI> which appears in our attempting what
<PB N="12" REF="005696_0011_1026C16102526FC8">
exceeds our Strength, and medling with Things two high for us. Proud Per&s;ons are full of vain Confidence, not knowing their Ignorance and Weakne&s;s, they ru&s;h into Snares and gra&s;p at a Weight which their Shoulders are not equal to. Directly con|trary to this was the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI>'s Practice, and hence he was able to appeal to God in the following Language: <HI>Lord my Heart is not haughty nor mine Eyes lofty, neither do I ex|erci&s;e my &s;elf in great Matters, or in Things too high for me.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxxxi. 1.</NOTE> In the&s;e Words it is plainly intimated, that haughty or proud Per&s;ons have lofty Looks, and are di&s;po&s;ed to meddle with Things above their Capaci|ty, which turns to their Di&s;grace in the I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> of <HI>Pride</HI> are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Our <HI>Violation</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI> of <HI>Works,</HI> by this we have lo&s;t the Image of God, and contracted that of the Devil, of which <HI>Pride</HI> is a dreadful Lineament, <NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 18. Rom. iii. 12.19.</NOTE> and altho' the Governing Power of this evil be broken by Conver&s;ion, yet there are &s;uch Remains of it, as will be a Grief
<PB N="13" REF="005696_0012_1026C162881F0E48">
and Exerci&s;e to us while we live. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 24.</NOTE> This Original Apo&s;tacy is therefore the prima|ry Cau&s;e of Pride. But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A more immediate Cau&s;e is the <HI>neglect of our own Hearts.</HI> If the&s;e were con&s;tantly watch'd, and frequently examin|ed, as they &s;hould be, we would &s;ee con|tinual Rea&s;on for Humiliation, and have an Opportuniry of giving check to the fir&s;t budings of Pride within us; But when our Hearts are neglected, our Wickedne&s;s is hid from us, the fir&s;t Motions of Sin are not oppos'd, and thus we are <HI>puff'd up in our vain Imaginations,</HI> and look on our &s;elves in a fal&s;e Light.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Another <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>Pride,</HI> is the <HI>Temptations of the Devil.</HI> He tries to blow the Coal of Corruptions in us to a Flame; he &s;ooths our Vanity, and flatters our Arro|gance until we fall from the imaginary Pi|nacle into the Myre. Thus he treated <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah;</HI> the former he &s;tirr'd up to Number the People, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. xxi. 17.</NOTE> and the Latter to &s;hew his Trea&s;ures to the <HI>A&s;&s;y|rian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, which brought Wrath upon the Nation.<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxxix. 4&mdash;7</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005696_0013_1026C1640EC84570"><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The <HI>groundle&s;s E&s;teem</HI> and <HI>Ap|plau&s;e</HI> of <HI>ignorant People,</HI> and the <HI>Hypocriti|cal Panegyricks</HI> of <HI>de&s;igning Para&s;ites,</HI> are apt to &s;tir up Pride, tho' they be equally un|worthy of our Notice; for the former know not our Weakne&s;s, and the latter are not &s;o Hone&s;t as to acquaint us of it.</P>
<P>It is true, Applau&s;e is apt, at fir&s;t e&s;peci|ally, to affect and plea&s;e us; for as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>as the fining Pot is for Silver, and the Furnace for Gold, &s;o is a Man to his Prai&s;e.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Proverbs xxvii. 21.</NOTE> However it is a Sign of a weak Mind to be frequently overcome by &s;uch a Temptation! Certainly the le&s;s Knowledge we have of God, our &s;elves, or the Things of God, and the &s;maller Mea&s;ure of Divine Grace we po&s;&s;e&s;s, the more apt we are to be puff'd up. Superficial Notions of Things give Occa&s;ion for Pride, but a thorough Knowledge of them has a humbling Ten|dency.</P>
<P>But I proceed to &s;peak of the <HI>Fruits</HI> of <HI>Pride,</HI> and that both in Relation to <HI>God, our &s;elves,</HI> and <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>Now in <HI>Relation to God, Pride</HI> has the
<PB N="15" REF="005696_0014_1026C167B3F010F8">
following awful <HI>Fruits!</HI> It di&s;po&s;es to con|temn his <HI>Authority,</HI> to &s;light his <HI>Love,</HI> to murmur at his <HI>Providence,</HI> and refu&s;e a <HI>Sub|mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to his <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> di&s;po&s;es to di&s;dain the Divine <HI>Au|thority</HI> and Government, like the wicked <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> of whom the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> &s;peaks. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii. 31.</NOTE> <HI>They &s;aid they were Lords and would come no more to the Almighty.</HI> Surely tho&s;e that wou'd hear the Commands of God to Purpo&s;e, mu&s;t oppo&s;e Pride, and hence the Prophet intreated the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the following Manner, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. xiii. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Hear ye, be not proud for the Lord hath &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed <HI>Pride</HI> does equally di&s;po&s;e to <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> again&s;t the Divine Love and Goodne&s;s. The Rea&s;on of which is this, &s;uch Per&s;ons have a high Opinion of their own Excellency's, and hence are in|clin'd to look upon the Gifts of God, as le&s;s then their Merit.</P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> does likewi&s;e for the &s;ame Rea&s;on di&s;po&s;e Men to <HI>murmur</HI> at God's <HI>providential Government,</HI> of the World in general, and of their Lot in Particular. They think that
<PB N="16" REF="005696_0015_1026C16940AE7428">
Things are not &s;o well manag'd as they &s;hould be, and e&s;pecially as to their Cir|cum&s;tances: The Language of which is, that had they been of God's Council, they could have taught him Knowledge. O bla&s;phemous Arrogance!</P>
<P>I may add, that another <HI>Fruit</HI> of <HI>Pride</HI> in Relation to God, is the Sinners <HI>Labour</HI> to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h a Way of Ju&s;tification by his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>his Refu&s;al of Submi&s;&s;ion to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 3.</NOTE> The Pride of Man's Heart is &s;uch, that he di&s;likes to be &s;trip'd of all Self-Dependance, and &s;av'd in a Way of pure Grace! But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Fruits of Pride in Relati|on to our &s;elves, are the&s;e; viz. It tends to deceive us, as to our <HI>State of Soul, and Progre&s;s in Religion, as well as to corrupt us in Principle and Practice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> tends to <HI>deceive</HI> us as to the <HI>State</HI> of our <HI>Souls,</HI> by inclining us to think that we are &s;omething when we are nothing. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 3.</NOTE> Many are prompted by the Pride of their Hearts, to take Conviction for Conver&s;ion; legal, for evangelical Sorrow, and Pre&s;umption for
<PB N="17" REF="005696_0016_1026C16C98B4F768">
that Faith which works by love, and changes the Life as well as the Heart. What avail &s;uch Comforts as do not humble the Soul and reform the Practice?</P>

<P>The Continuance of tho&s;e Things is al&s;o &s;o &s;hort and uncertain, that it may ju&s;tly give check to our a&s;piring Thoughts about them; it is the vaine&s;t Vanity to be high-minded, and tru&s;t in uncertain Riches, <HI>which often make to them&s;elves Wings and fly away, as the Eagle towards Heaven!</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 5.</NOTE></P>
