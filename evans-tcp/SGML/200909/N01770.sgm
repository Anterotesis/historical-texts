<P>I De&s;ire to premi&s;e a few things con|cerning the following <HI>Dialogues,</HI> and the Occa&s;ion of their Publication. As to the <HI>Dialogues</HI> them&s;elves they con|tain a rich and precious &s;tore of &s;piritual Knowledge and godly Comfort. They &s;peak to the Hearts of Men in a very ea&s;ie and familiar manner, &s;o that the meane&s;t <HI>Plough-man,</HI> the very meane&s;t of God's People may under&s;tand them. They treat of that deep but comfortable Doctrin, (that <HI>Soul-pierceing</HI> Doctrin to the wicked and unregenerate, but <HI>Soul-refre&s;hing</HI> and <HI>Heart-comforting</HI> Doctrin to the Saints, to all righteous and godly Folk;) I mean the Doctrin of <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Predestination.</HI></P>
<P>And now as to the Occa&s;ion of the Pub|lication of the&s;e <HI>Dialogues.</HI> Alas <HI>Chri&s;tians!</HI> I fear there is too, too great Occa&s;ion for them.

<P>You ea&s;ily apprehend the Difference betwixt <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Cruelty.

And this is the highe&s;t <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> But the <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of the <HI>Prede&s;tinarians</HI> is all <HI>Imagination,</HI> being built upon <HI>Decrees</HI> which they confe&s;s to be <HI>&s;ecret</HI> and <HI>hid|den</HI> from us. Therefor it is no Wonder they &s;hou'd cry out for <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> in their Extremity. And when they <HI>&s;ay</HI> or may <HI>think</HI> they have it, and <HI>boa&s;t</HI> in it, yet they can give no Rea&s;on for it, and therefor it is but <HI>Imagination</HI> &s;till. Im|pre&s;&s;ions upon the <HI>Imagination</HI> may give great <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and even <HI>Raptures</HI> of <HI>Joy.</HI> And if the&s;e are built upon the true <HI>Foundation,</HI> they are <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>precious Stones;</HI> otherwi&s;e they are but <HI>Hay</HI> and <HI>Stubble,</HI> and will not endure the <HI>Fire.</HI> They are often the <HI>Delu&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> who thus transforms him&s;elf into an <HI>Angel</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> and deceives many an <HI>unstable</HI> Soul. But they mu&s;t be try'd by the <HI>Foundation.</HI> Upon which they are not built, if we can give no <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> for them, but are <HI>Fla&s;hes</HI> and <HI>Meteors,</HI> and give a <HI>fal&s;e Light.</HI> We may know them likewi&s;e by their Effects.

<P>I Hope Sir, that what you have &s;aid of <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> will &s;atisfie others as well as it has me. <HI>First,</HI> that the whole Di&s;pute, as manag'd by the <HI>Calvinists,</HI> is all built upon a wrong <HI>Foundation,</HI> even by their own <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> in arguing <HI>&s;trictly</HI> from Words <HI>ad Captum,</HI> and which they confe&s;s to be &s;o; and will not &s;uffer the like to be done in any other Ca&s;e. Therefor that they ought to &s;top their Di&s;putes upon this Point, till they can find <HI>proper</HI> Words to &s;peak by, if they will &s;peak <HI>properly</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> And the&s;e Di&s;putes ought to cea&s;e for a &s;econd Rea&s;on you have given, which is, that they are <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e whatever the <HI>&s;ecret Decrees</HI> of <HI>God</HI> may be &s;uppos'd to be, yet that they cannot <HI>go against</HI> or <HI>invalidate</HI> his Will declar'd openly in the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> for that wou'd be to <HI>contradict</HI> Him&s;elf. Therefor that we may work in <HI>Hope,</HI> and chear|fully apply our &s;elves to the <HI>performing</HI> of what He has <HI>commanded</HI> us; with full <HI>Trust</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> in what He has <HI>pro|mis'd,</HI> without <HI>perplexing</HI> and <HI>intangling</HI> our &s;elves in the&s;e <HI>Di&s;putes</HI> about his <HI>&s;ecret
<PB N="20" REF="002100_0029_0FBB8191E38BCEC8">
Decrees;</HI> for they mu&s;t go according to his <HI>reveal'd Will.</HI> In this we are <HI>&s;ure,</HI> and therefor the&s;e <HI>Di&s;putes</HI> are at the be&s;t <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> to us; but of mo&s;t pernicious <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> when taken by the wrong Handle, as you have fully &s;hew'd. But ther is one Thing wherein Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and the <HI>Predestinari|ans</HI> do very much boa&s;t, they &s;ay that their Doctrin is agreeable to our 39 <HI>Articles;</HI> and therefor that our <HI>Clergy</HI> have <HI>apo&s;tatiz'd</HI> (as Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> words it) from the Do|ctrin of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> and that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are the true <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>En|gland,</HI> becau&s;e they hold <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> and are again&s;t <HI>Free-will,</HI> as they &s;ay our <HI>Arti|cles</HI> likewi&s;e &s;peak. Now tho' this be no Argument as to the Doctrin it &s;elf, yet to tho&s;e of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> it is of very great <HI>Con&s;equence,</HI> as well to vindicate the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as to &s;top the Mouths of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> which are all open upon us on this Account.</P>

<P>The tenth <HI>Article</HI> is of <HI>Free-will.</HI> Which is not at all there deny'd, but ra|ther &s;uppos'd and a&s;&s;erted. But it &s;uppo|&s;es the Concurrence of the <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>God</HI> by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to be nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>incline</HI> and <HI>guide</HI> our <HI>Will,</HI> and to <HI>work</HI> with us, <HI>When we have that good Will.</HI> Which is exactly agreeable

to what I have &s;aid before of <HI>Grace</HI> and our <HI>working</HI> with it, page 6.</P>
<P>The 17th <HI>Article</HI> is of <HI>Prede&s;tination.</HI> And keeps to the <HI>Scripture-Phra&s;e</HI> of God's <HI>ordaining before the World began,</HI> of <HI>calling</HI> whom he <HI>fore-knew, justifying, &s;anctifying</HI> them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which is to be under&s;tood in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> and no <HI>other</HI> &s;en&s;e than as the&s;e Words are us'd in <HI>holy Scripture,</HI> which all agree to be <HI>ad Captum,</HI> as we have di&s;|cours'd it before. And the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Scripture</HI> are, according to our Capacities and Manner of &s;peaking, as this <HI>Article</HI> &s;ays, <HI>full of &s;weet, plea&s;ant and un&s;peakable Comfort to godly Per&s;ons.</HI> But then this <HI>Article</HI> checks the <HI>Curio&s;ities</HI> of this Di&s;|pute (which is what I have been bla|ming) and &s;ays, <HI>For curious and carnal Per|&s;ons lacking the Spirit of Chri&s;t, to have con|tinually before their Eyes the Sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous Down|fal, whereby the Devil doth thrust them ei|ther into De&s;peration, or into Wretchle&s;ne&s;s of most unclean Living, no le&s;s Pernicious than De&s;peration.</HI></P>

<P>THer is one Point remaining that follows from that of <HI>Prede&s;tina|tion</HI> we have been upon; in which I wou'd have you, <HI>Country-man,</HI> to be well ground|ed, and therefor mu&s;t examin you a little upon it. The&s;e <HI>Prede&s;tinarians</HI> placing all upon the eternal <HI>Decrees</HI> of <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation,</HI> allow not of <HI>&V;niver&s;al Redemp|tion,</HI> or that <HI>Christ</HI> dy'd for <HI>All.</HI> Becau&s;e, &s;ay they, if <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> dy'd for the <HI>Reprobate,</HI> it was totally in vain, and the End of his
<PB N="26" REF="002100_0035_0FBB819BDD030850">
<HI>Sufferings</HI> mu&s;t be fru&s;trated as to them. Be&s;ides that he cou'd not intend or de&s;ign to <HI>Save</HI> tho&s;e whom <HI>God</HI> had <HI>Reprobated</HI> by an <HI>eternal Decree.</HI></P>
<P>Now let me &s;ee what you have to &s;ay to this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to <HI>eternal Decrees,</HI> enough has been &s;aid to that already, that ther is no arguing from it, being only Words <HI>ad Cap|tum,</HI> and therefor not to be <HI>strictly</HI> and <HI>pro|perly</HI> taken. So I di&s;mi&s;s that Point. But now as to <HI>univer&s;al Redemption,</HI> the <HI>Scripture</HI> is plain, which &s;ays, That <HI>Christ dy'd for all.</HI> And <HI>wou'd have none to peri&s;h, but all to come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI> And <HI>as in Adam all dye, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</HI> And many other &s;uch like Texts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But all are not made <HI>alive,</HI> that is, in <HI>Christ,</HI> &s;o as to be <HI>Saved,</HI> for many <HI>peri&s;h.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet <HI>Christ</HI> dy'd even for tho&s;e who <HI>peri&s;h.</HI> As it is &s;aid 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.11. in the Ca&s;e of giving <HI>Scandal</HI> to a weak Brother. <HI>And thro' thy Knowledge &s;hall the weak Brother pe|ri&s;h, for whom Christ died?</HI></P>
<P>Now I help my &s;elf to under&s;tand this, by a familiar Example. Suppo&s;e you came to a <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> and taking a Li&s;t of all the <HI>Debtors,</HI> &s;hou'd pay all their <HI>Debts, Co&s;ts,
<PB N="27" REF="002100_0036_0FBB819F82307490">
Charges</HI> and all. And opening the <HI>Pri&s;on-Doors,</HI> &s;hou'd tell them, they were all at LI|BERTY who wou'd <HI>accept</HI> of it, and <HI>come out</HI> in &s;uch a Time. After which the <HI>Pri|&s;on-Doors</HI> &s;hou'd be <HI>lock'd</HI> again, and they &s;hou'd be kept there, 'till they had paid the <HI>uttermost Farthing.</HI> Upon this, &s;ome thank|fully accept of your Goodne&s;s, and <HI>come out.</HI> But ther are others, who de&s;pi&s;e your <HI>Mercy,</HI> or will not <HI>believe</HI> you, or under&s;tand not the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of <HI>Liberty,</HI> but prefer the &s;ordid Life of a <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> the <HI>Pot</HI> and the <HI>Pipe,</HI> and will not <HI>come out.</HI> Which is the very <HI>Condemnation</HI> our <HI>Saviour</HI> &s;poke of when He &s;aid, that <HI>Light was come into the World, but Men loved Darkne&s;s rather than Light, becau&s;e their Deeds were evil.</HI> The <HI>Light</HI> was offer'd to all. But &s;ome lov'd <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> better. It is &s;aid that <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> are &s;et before us, yet &s;ome chu&s;e <HI>Death.</HI> An <HI>Habit</HI> of <HI>Sinning</HI> contracts a Love to it, that we are loth to leave it.</P>
<P>The Application is this. The <HI>Debt</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Pri&s;oners</HI> who Stay'd in the <HI>Pri&s;on</HI> was pay'd as well as of tho&s;e who came out. And as the <HI>Relea&s;e</HI> of the one is wholly owing to Him who pay'd the <HI>Debt;</HI> &s;o the <HI>Condemnation</HI> of the other, lies wholly at his own Door, becau&s;e, He wou'd not ac|cept
<PB N="28" REF="002100_0037_0FBB81A10BF94308">
of his <HI>Liberty. Something</HI> was left to the <HI>Pri&s;oners</HI> to do, <HI>to chu&s;e whether they wou'd come out, or stay in.</HI> God (tho' a God of infinit Mercy) will not &s;ave us a|gain&s;t our Will. This &s;hews <HI>Free-will.</HI> But ther is no <HI>Merit</HI> in us, when we ac|cept of his <HI>Salvation.</HI> We pay not a <HI>Pen|ny</HI> of the <HI>Debt,</HI> He pays it all. And all the <HI>Thanks</HI> and the <HI>Glory</HI> is to Him. But if He did not pay my <HI>Debt,</HI> how cou'd I be blam'd for &s;taying in the <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> when my <HI>Debt</HI> lay &s;till upon me, that I cou'd not get out? How cou'd I be call'd <HI>un|grateful</HI> to Him who <HI>pay'd</HI> nothing for me, nor ever did <HI>de&s;ign</HI> it? And how can wicked Men be blam'd for <HI>trampling</HI> un|der Foot the Blood of the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> for <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing</HI> and <HI>re&s;i&s;ting</HI> his <HI>Grace,</HI> if He Shed <HI>no Blood</HI> for them, nor ever gave them any <HI>&s;aving Grace?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;ire Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> (or any One of his Opinion) to an&s;wer this. But this brings me to another Point which follows in the Train of <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of the&s;e Mens Notion of <HI>Predestination.</HI> For from the <HI>eternal Decrees,</HI> as they put it, they infer that ther can be no failing from <HI>Grace,</HI> becau&s;e this might defeat the <HI>Decree.</HI> And therefor that Men cannot

finally <HI>re&s;i&s;t</HI> his <HI>Grace,</HI> or fall from it.

<P>REverend Sir, before I take my leave of you, I wou'd willingly be infor|med whether what I have heard of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> be true or not. I have heard that many of them are turn'd <HI>Arians</HI> and <HI>So|cinians.</HI> I pray now, is it true?</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes <HI>Country-man,</HI> it is too true! Ma|ny of the <HI>di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters</HI> them&s;elves have publickly profe&s;s'd them&s;elves <HI>Socini|ans;</HI> that is, they deny <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be <HI>God.</HI> The&s;e are &s;ome of tho&s;e of whom the <HI>Scripture</HI> &s;peaks, that in the latter Times Men wou'd ari&s;e who wou'd deny the <HI>God</HI> that bought them.

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Remark is ju&s;t, Country-man. This was the chief Rea&s;on, that made that <HI>Arch-Heretick,</HI> that <HI>uncircumcis'd Phili&s;tine,</HI> their infamous Mr. <HI>James Peirce,</HI> who is one of the chief of the&s;e <HI>Infidels,</HI> I &s;ay it was chiefly his Inclination to this <HI>Here&s;ie</HI> that made him &s;o loudly exclaim again&s;t the <HI>Festivals</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of our excellent <HI>Church;</HI> particularly again&s;t our <HI>Bowing,</HI> in the <HI>publick A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> at the mo&s;t <HI>&s;olemn.</HI> and <HI>devout</HI> Mention of the <HI>Name</HI> of the e|ver ble&s;&s;ed JESUS.</P>
<P>This made him &s;ay, in his <HI>Vindication</HI> of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> page 531. <Q>But we can &s;ee no Rea&s;on why we &s;hou'd rather bow at the Name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> than at the Name <HI>God, Je|hovah, Christ, or Saviour,</HI> which is the &s;ame with <HI>Je&s;us.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Therefor in An&s;wer to this arrogant and <HI>in&s;ulting Infidel,</HI> and to all other Enemies of our holy <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> I will in&s;truct Thee my <HI>Christian Friend</HI> concerning the true
<PB N="34" REF="002100_0043_0FBB81AC8F0DBAB0">
Rea&s;on of that <HI>laudable</HI> and truly <HI>Pious</HI> Cu&s;tom, I mean <HI>that</HI> of <HI>reverently Bowing</HI> in the publick A&s;&s;emblies of <HI>Christians,</HI> at the <HI>&s;olemn</HI> Mention of the Sacred <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>holy,</HI> the <HI>ever-ble&s;&s;ed</HI> and always to be adored JESUS,</P>
<P>The Word JESUS &s;ignifies a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and is the <HI>proper</HI> Name of OUR <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Saviour,</HI> who had this Name given Him by the <HI>Angel,</HI> before He was conceiv'd in the <HI>Womb.</HI> So that this is his <HI>Per&s;onal</HI> Name. The Word <HI>Christ</HI> denotes <HI>only</HI> his <HI>Office,</HI> as He was the <HI>anointed</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> which that <HI>Word</HI> &s;ignifies.</P>
<P>Now, there was in the <HI>Apostles</HI> Time, a Set of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> as <HI>Cerinthus</HI> and his <HI>Followers,</HI> who deny'd <HI>This Je&s;us</HI> to be the <HI>Christ.</HI> They &s;aid that <HI>Christ,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> (for they made no Di&s;tincti|on) dwelt in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as in other holy Men. That it de&s;cended upon Him at his <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> but left Him on the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> which made Him cry, <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou for&s;aken me?</HI> Again&s;t the&s;e the <HI>Apostles</HI> wrote. And the Burden of their Arguments was to prove that THIS <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is the <HI>Christ.</HI> As St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid, (<HI>Act.</HI> 2.36.) <HI>Therefore let all the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael know a&s;&s;uredly, that God hath made

<P N="1">I. WHEN I heard of your well order'd Love and Charity in God, being full of joy I de&s;ired much to &s;peak unto you in the Faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For hav|ing been thought worthy to obtain a mo&s;t Excellent Name, in the Bonds which I carry about, I &s;alute the Churches; wi&s;h|ing in them a Union both of the Body &amp; Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Eternal Life: <HI>As al&s;o</HI> of Faith and Charity, to which nothing is preferred: But e&s;pecially of Je&s;us and the
<PB N="40" REF="002100_0049_0FBB81B5F9CBBB08">
Father; in whom if we undergo all the In|juries of the Prince of this pre&s;ent World, and e&s;cape, we &s;hall enjoy God.</P>
<P N="2">II. SEEING then I have been judged worthy to &s;ee you, by DAMAS your mo&s;t Excellent Bi&s;hop; and by your <HI>very</HI> worthy Presbyters BASSUS, and APOLLONIUS; and by my Fellow Servant SOTIO the Dea|con; in whom I rejoyce, fora&s;much as He is &s;ubject unto <HI>his</HI> Bi&s;hop as to the Grace of God, and to the Presbytery as to the Law of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; <HI>I determined to Write unto you.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. WHEREFORE it will become you al&s;o not to u&s;e your Bi&s;hop too familiarly upon the account of his Youth; but to yield all Reverence to Him according to the Pow|er of God the Father: As al&s;o I perceive that your Holy Presbyters do; not con&s;ider|ing his Age, which indeed to appearance is Young; but as becomes tho&s;e who are Prudent in God, &s;ubmitting to Him, or rather not to Him, but to the Father of <HI>our Lord</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Bi&s;hop of us All. It will there|fore behove you, with all Sincerity, to obey your <HI>Bi&s;hop;</HI> in Honour of Him who&s;e plea&s;ure it is <HI>that you &s;hould do &s;o.</HI> Becau&s;e he that <HI>does not do &s;o,</HI> deceives not the Bi&s;hop whom he &s;ees, but affronts him that is In|vi&s;ible.
<PB N="41" REF="002100_0050_0FBB81B797335C90">
For what&s;oever of this kind <HI>is done,</HI> it reflects not upon Man, but upon God, who knows the Secrets of <HI>our Hearts.</HI></P>

But I can never think that &s;uch as the&s;e have a good Con&s;cience, &s;eeing they are not gather'd to|gether throughly according to <HI>God's Com|mandment.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. SEEING then <HI>all</HI> things have an End, there are the&s;e two indifferently &s;et before Us, Death and Life: And every one &s;hall depart unto his proper place. For as there are two &s;orts of Coins, the one of God, the other of the World; and each of the&s;e has its proper In&s;cription engraven upon it; <HI>So al&s;o is it Here.</HI> The Unbelievers are of this World; but the Faithful, through Charity, have the Character of God the Father by Je|&s;us Chri&s;t: By whom if we are not readily di&s;po&s;ed to Die after the likene&s;s of his Pa&s;|&s;ion, His Life is not in Us.</P>
<P N="6">VI. FORASMUCH therefore as I have in the Per&s;ons before-mentioned, &s;een all of you in Faith and Charity; I exhort you that ye &s;tudy to do all things in a Divine Concord: Your Bi&s;hop pre&s;iding in the place of God;
<PB N="42" REF="002100_0051_0FBB81BA55C6CC70">
your Presbyters in the place of the Council of the Apo&s;tles; and your Deacons mo&s;t dear to Me, being intru&s;ted with the Mini&s;try of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who was with the Father be|fore all Ages, and appeared in the End <HI>to us.</HI> Wherefore taking the &s;ame Holy Cour&s;e, <HI>&s;ee that</HI> ye all Reverence one another: And let no one look upon his Neighbour after the Fle&s;h; but do ye all mutually love each other in Je|&s;us Chri&s;t. Let there be nothing that may be able to make a Divi&s;ion among you; but be ye united to your Bi&s;hop, and tho&s;e who Pre&s;ide over you, to be your Pattern and Direction <HI>in the way</HI> to Immortality.</P>
<P N="7">VII. AS therefore the LORD did nothing without the Father, being united to Him; neither by Him&s;elf nor <HI>yet</HI> by his Apo&s;tles; So neither do ye do any thing without your Bi&s;hop &amp; Presbyters: Neither endeavour to let any thing appear rational to your &s;elves apart; but being come together into the &s;ame place, have one <HI>Common</HI> Prayer; One Sup|plication; One Mind; One Hope; in Char|ity, and in Joy undefiled. There is One Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, than whom nothing is Better.

WHEREFORE if they who were brought up in <HI>the&s;e</HI> antient Laws came <HI>never|thele&s;s</HI> to the Newne&s;s of Hope; no longer ob&s;erving Sabbaths, but keeping the Lord's Day, in which al&s;o our Life is &s;prung up by Him, and through his Death, whom <HI>yet</HI> &s;ome deny: (By which My&s;tery we have been brought to Believe, and therefore wait that we may be found the Di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our only Ma&s;ter:) How &s;hall we be able to live Different from Him; who&s;e Di&s;ciples the very Prophets them&s;elves be|ing, did by the Spirit expect Him as their Ma&s;ter.

Lay a&s;ide therefore the Old, and Sour, and Evil Leaven; and be ye changed into the New Leaven, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P N="12">XII. MAY I <HI>therefore</HI> have Joy of you in all things, if I &s;hall be worthy of it. For tho' I am Bound, yet I am not worthy to be compared to one of you that are at Liberty. I know that ye are not puffed up; for ye have Je&s;us Chri&s;t in your Hearts.
