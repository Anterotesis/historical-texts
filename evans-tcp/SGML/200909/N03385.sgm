<P>My Text con&s;iders <HI>us,</HI> 1. in our <HI>Sins,</HI> and &s;peaks of <HI>God</HI> in his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> as a <HI>con&s;uming Fire:</HI> It con|&s;iders us al&s;o, 2. under the <HI>Wing</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God's <HI>Grace,</HI> and it &s;peaks of the <HI>Mercies and Compa&s;&s;ions of God,</HI> to his &s;inful provoking Peo|ple, as <HI>new every Morning.</HI></P>
<P>We are here <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> every Day to do enough to <HI>provoke</HI> the con&s;uming Anger of our God; and this gives the <HI>Glory</HI> to His Mercies, in all their <HI>Con&s;tancy</HI> and <HI>Multitude,</HI> notwith&s;tanding our daily <HI>Forfeitures</HI> of them all, and <HI>De&s;ert</HI> of con|&s;uming Wrath.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> in my <HI>Context</HI> was in a manner, and in the very <HI>Letter</HI> con&s;umed; <HI>Judea, Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> the <HI>Temple</HI> of God, and his <HI>Synagogues</HI> thro' the Land, were <HI>burnt with Fire;</HI> mo&s;t of the In|habitants had been <HI>&s;lain</HI> with the Sword, and the Re&s;idue, a &s;mall <HI>Remnant,</HI> were led into a doleful <HI>Captivity,</HI> to con&s;ume away there for <HI>&s;eventy Years.</HI> This it is that the Prophet <HI>Jere|miah</HI> is here <HI>lamenting</HI> in the Name of the de&s;o|late Church; yet never the le&s;s, that there was

<P>He writes for <HI>our Warning</HI> and learning, on whom the <HI>Ends</HI> of the World are come, and aw|fully admoni&s;hes <HI>us</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Lord,</HI> "That when the Day of Mercy is <HI>pa&s;t</HI> with Places and Per&s;ons, they will be <HI>con&s;umed</HI> by the burning Wrath of God; His Mercies will be <HI>clean gone,</HI> and his Compa&s;&s;ions <HI>fail for evermore.</HI> &mdash;This Day of Mercy might have been <HI>pa&s;t with us</HI> long &s;ince, and that it is not <HI>&s;o</HI> is becau&s;e <HI>God's Compa&s;&s;ions fail not.</HI></P>
<P>Many more and various are the <HI>Reflections</HI> which the <HI>Text</HI> affords us, but I will content my &s;elf with the&s;e <HI>three</HI> mo&s;t plain and ea&s;y <HI>Ob&s;er|vations.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Lord our God is of great <HI>Mercies and Compa&s;&s;ions.</HI> 2. His Compa&s;&s;ions <HI>fail not.</HI> 3. Hence it is that <HI>we are not con&s;umed.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The Lord our God is of great Mercies and Com|pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> The&s;e my <HI>Text</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, a&s;&s;erts and magnifies.</P>
<P><HI>Mercy</HI> in God is his Goodne&s;s and Grace ex|tended and exerci&s;ed toward <HI>&s;inful Creatures. Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> in God &s;peaks <HI>ad Hominem,</HI> to the Pity and <HI>Bowels</HI> of <HI>Human Nature</HI> toward Con&s;orts, Children, Relatives and Friends in Affliction. We know well what a <HI>Mother's</HI> Bowels are, and a <HI>Fa|ther's</HI> Pity, and a <HI>Friend's</HI> Sympathy; and by the&s;e it plea&s;es God (in his great Conde&s;cention) to repre&s;ent the working of his <HI>Mercy</HI> toward his
<PB N="4" REF="004131_0005_1003D2FAA95CAB38">People. P&s;al. ciii. 13. <HI>Like as a Father pitieth his Children &s;o the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</HI> Jer. xxxi 20. <HI>I earne&s;tly remember him, my Bowels are troubled for him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> in Man cau&s;es a <HI>painful</HI> Commotion within him, being mix'd of <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Love;</HI> but the <HI>render Mercies</HI> of God are without the Infir|mity of our Pity.</P>
<P>No wonder that the <HI>Scripture</HI> abounds in this mo&s;t <HI>endearing</HI> Repre&s;entation of God to us; for if he will be a God to <HI>Sinners,</HI> He mu&s;t be a God of Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It &s;peaks <HI>all the Glories</HI> of the Name of God, proclaimed before <HI>Mo&s;es, "merciful, gracious, long|&s;uffering and abundant in Goodne&s;s.</HI> P&s;al lxxxvi. 15. <HI>But thou, O Lord, art a God full of Compa&s;&s;ion and gracious, long&s;uffering and plenteous in Mercy.</HI> And again, P&s;al. cxlv. 8. <HI>The Lord is gracious and full of Compa&s;&s;ion, &s;low to Anger, and of great Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>But there is no Expre&s;&s;ion more <HI>moving</HI> than that, I&s;ai lxiii 15. <HI>The &s;ounding of thy Bowels, and of thy Mercy toward me:</HI> and that, Luke i. 78. <HI>The Bowels of the Mercy of our God.</HI> The Bowels of a God are more <HI>tender</HI> than tho&s;e of a Father or Mother: I&s;ai. xlix 15. <HI>Can a Woman forget her &s;ucking Child, that &s;he &s;hould not have Compa&s;&s;ion on the Son of her Womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> would rai&s;e us to the la&s;t Pitch of Brotherly Love and Goodne&s;s, he bids us <HI>put on Bowels of Mercies;</HI> and when <HI>another</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004131_0006_1003D307C38AE028">Apo&s;tle is naming the Love of God to us, he as vehemently forbids <HI>our &s;hutting up Bowels of Com|pa&s;&s;ion</HI> from one another.</P>
<P><HI>Such</HI> are the <HI>Divine Compa&s;&s;ions:</HI> And if you <HI>ask,</HI> "Whence then is it that we &s;ee &s;o many <HI>Objects of Mi&s;ery</HI> round about us, and that the <HI>Children of God</HI> them&s;elves are &s;o often the <HI>Sub|jects</HI> of grievous Afflictions? the <HI>An&s;wer</HI> is ea&s;y,</P>
<P N="1">1. They are of our <HI>Selves</HI> and our <HI>Sins;</HI> this is the <HI>Original</HI> and meritorious Cau&s;e of them: We may not charge <HI>God</HI> with them, but mu&s;t take the Blame and Shame of them to our Selves. Lament. i. 18. <HI>The Lord is righteous, for we have rebelled again&s;t him.</HI> Jer. ii. 19. <HI>Ha&s;t thou not pro|cured this unto thy Self? thine own Wickedne&s;s &s;hall correct thee, and thy Back&s;lidings &s;hall reprove thee: Know therefore and &s;ee that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee, &s;aith the Lord God of Ho&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God &s;ends <HI>&s;ore Afflictions</HI> on Sinners very often in <HI>great Mercy</HI> and in tender <HI>Pity:</HI> to con|vince them of the Evil of their Sins, to bring them to Repentance, and &s;o to prepare them for the Favours of his Providence and the Comforts of his Grace in this Life, and for his Everla&s;t|ing Mercies in that to come. Rev. iii. 19. <HI>Whom I love I rebuke and cha&s;ten, be zealous therefore and repent.</HI> Heb. xii. 6. <HI>For whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;tneth, as a Father his Son in whom he delighteth.</HI> &mdash;A loving <HI>Parent</HI> corrects his Son from a real and &s;trong Affection, and from true <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> A Father can be very <HI>angry</HI> with a &s;inning Child, but upon his Humiliation and Repentance he
<PB N="6" REF="004131_0007_1003B58AC435E180"><HI>tenders</HI> him again. And &s;o does our <HI>Heavenly Father:</HI> Jerem. xxxi. 18. <HI>I have &s;urely heard E|phraim bemoaning him&s;elf thus, "Thou ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed me,</HI> &amp;c: "Is he <HI>a dear Son, is he a plea&s;ant Child? for I do earne&s;tly remember him &s;till, I will &s;urely have Mercy on him, faith the Lord.</HI> Souls in the deepe&s;t Humiliation of Repentance, &s;hould be in the &s;tronge&s;t Exerci&s;e of Faith in the Divine Compa&s;&s;ions. This is in a lively manner repre|&s;ented in my <HI>Context,</HI> Ver. 28&mdash;32. <HI>He &s;itteth alone and keepeth Silence, he putteth his Mouth in the Du&s;t, he is filled with Reproach; for the Lord will not ca&s;t off for ever, but tho' he cau&s;e Grief yet will be have Compa&s;&s;ion, according to the Multitude of his Mercies; for he doth not willingly afflict or grieve the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I am now to go on, and &s;ay of the&s;e Di|vine <HI>Compa&s;&s;ions</HI> and Mercies, that they <HI>fail not:</HI> No, they are <HI>new every Morning:</HI> they continue and abide, keep their Cour&s;e and go their Round; returning on us as con&s;tantly as the <HI>Day</HI> and as the <HI>Sun</HI> do. Every Day brings <HI>new</HI> Mercies; and they are like the <HI>Rayes of Light</HI> for Number and for Kind, bright and con&s;picuous, and in infinite endle&s;s Succe&s;&s;ions. Or if you will take the Compari&s;on from the living Springs and Fountains of <HI>Water,</HI> which &s;end forth their chri&s;|tal Streams day and night for our Supply and Refre&s;hment; <HI>God</HI> is this <HI>Fountain of living Wa|ter; a Spring of Water, who&s;e Waters fail not,</HI> I&s;ai. lviii. 11.</P>
<P>We read of the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>God,</HI> that He is <HI>rich</HI> in in Mercy, <HI>plenteous</HI> in Mercy, <HI>abundant</HI> in Mercy,
<PB N="7" REF="004131_0008_1003D31B2574A368">and that it is <HI>Everla&s;ting:</HI> A Mercy that <HI>never fails</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>all</HI> this, can be nothing le&s;s.</P>
<P>As God is in <HI>Him&s;elf,</HI> &s;uch mu&s;t his <HI>Mercies</HI> be. If <HI>He</HI> be the immen&s;e infinite <HI>Being,</HI> eternal and unchangeable; how &s;hould his Compa&s;&s;ions <HI>fail?</HI> any more than Eternity and Infinity be exhau&s;ted.&mdash; With what a <HI>Run</HI> of Repetition therefore, and of Plea&s;ure, does the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> teach us to &s;ing of a <HI>Mercy</HI> that never fails? P&s;al. cxxxvi. "<HI>For his Mercy endureth for Ever! for his Mercy endureth for Ever!</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Compa&s;&s;ions of God may <HI>cea&s;e</HI> indeed toward particular <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Places,</HI> and yet <HI>He</HI> remain the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Compa&s;&s;ionate God: His <HI>Spi|rit will not always &s;trive</HI> with provoking Sinners; the Day of his Grace <HI>ends</HI> with many, and with &s;ome &s;ooner than with others: His Mercies <HI>cea&s;e for ever</HI> as to <HI>impenitent</HI> Sinners, and are <HI>gone for evermore</HI> as to them that <HI>die</HI> &s;o: But they can never fail <HI>at all</HI> toward the proper and only <HI>Ob|jects</HI> of them, or in that <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> which the Holi|ne&s;s and Wi&s;dom of God has &s;ettled for the per|petual and everla&s;ting Di&s;play of them: The Immutability of God and the Promi&s;es of his Word make it impo&s;&s;ible. I&s;ai. xxx. 18. <HI>There|fore will the Lord</HI> wait <HI>that he may be gracious, and will be exalted in &s;hewing Mercy, for the Lord is a God of Judgment, and ble&s;&s;ed are all they that wait for him.</HI> As God's <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is like the great Mountains, high and con&s;picuous, fix'd and im|movable; &s;o his <HI>Compa&s;&s;ions</HI> &s;tand upon his <HI>Truth</HI> and Faithfulne&s;s: I&s;ai. liv. 10. <HI>The Mountains &s;hall depart, and the Hills be removed; but my Kind|ne&s;s &s;hall not depart from thee, nor the Covenant of my
<PB N="8" REF="004131_0009_1003D31F0FD35888">Peace be removed, faith the Lord that hath Mercy on thee.</HI></P>
<P>We have highly <HI>de&s;erved</HI> that the Compa&s;&s;ions of God &s;hould have been at <HI>an utter End,</HI> as to <HI>us,</HI> long ago; yet they have not <HI>failed</HI> even to <HI>us</HI> evil &amp; unthankful, unto this Day; no not in any or all of the <HI>Afflictions</HI> that have come upon us for our <HI>Sins:</HI> Ezra ix. 13. <HI>Thou Lord ha&s;h puni&s;hed us le&s;s than our Iniquities have de&s;erved.</HI> P&s;al. lxxviii. 38. <HI>But He being full of Compa&s;&s;ion de&s;troyed them not, yea many a time turned he his Anger away, and did not &s;tir up all his Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>I come therefore to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">III. Hence it is that <HI>we are not con&s;umed;</HI> even of the <HI>Lord's Mercies,</HI> and becau&s;e <HI>they fail not:</HI></P>
<P>Let us <HI>turn a&s;ide</HI> and &s;ee this <HI>great Sight,</HI> this Wonder of Grace! like that which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had in <HI>Horeb;</HI> he &s;aw <HI>a Bu&s;h on Fire, and it was not con&s;umed!</HI> My <HI>Text</HI> gives us the &s;ame Sight of <HI>God,</HI> as a <HI>con&s;uming Fire,</HI> and of <HI>our Selves</HI> as Chaff and <HI>Stubble</HI> before devouring Fire, and yet not <HI>con&s;umed</HI> thereby. As the <HI>Word</HI> of God, &s;o a wicked <HI>World</HI> is full of the&s;e <HI>two</HI> things; the <HI>flaming Anger</HI> of God again&s;t Sin, and yet a Multitude of Sinners not <HI>con&s;umed</HI> thereby.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on and <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of this is to be <HI>&s;ought,</HI> and can be only <HI>found</HI> in God Him&s;elf: It is of the <HI>Lord's Mercies</HI> and his unfailing Compa&s;&s;ions. Not for <HI>our</HI> Repentance, or <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> be it <HI>known</HI> to us, but for His own <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> &s;ake. "<HI>Not unto us, O Lord!</HI> mu&s;t we &s;ay, <HI>Not unto us! but to Thy Name give Glory; for thy Mercy

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We behold God here in his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and in his <HI>Judgments</HI> a <HI>con&s;uming Fire;</HI> and Sinners the <HI>Chaff</HI> and Stubble, ready to be <HI>con&s;umed.</HI> Heb. xii. 29. <HI>For the Lord our God is a con&s;uming Fire.</HI> God is <HI>angry</HI> with the wicked every Day.

<P>God ea&s;ily con&s;umes a wicked People by pe&s;|tilential <HI>Sickne&s;&s;es,</HI> by <HI>Famine</HI> or <HI>War;</HI> by <HI>Fires</HI> a&s;hore and by <HI>Storms</HI> at Sea.
