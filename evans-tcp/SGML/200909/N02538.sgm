<P><HI>THY Heart;</HI> i. e. thy <HI>whole Spirit, Soul and Body.</HI> Thy <HI>Heart,</HI> i. e. thy Love and Affections, with all thy Mind and Strength. It is the <HI>fir&s;tand great Commandment</HI> of the Law. The <HI>&s;ummary</HI> of all Religion, of all Duty. It is <HI>more than all whole Burnt Offering and Sacrifice.</HI> What does the Lord thy God require of thee but this? to love the Lord thy God with <HI>all</HI> thy Heart and with all thy Soul?</P>
<P>ALL Devotion and Obedience is of the heart. All the Under&s;tanding and all the Soul is in it. And every thing el&s;e too that belongs to us. The Heart carries all things with it. It gives all with it &s;elf. So in Friend&s;hip, as <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;trip't him&s;elf, and gave all to <HI>David.</HI> And &s;o in Marriage, the Per&s;on and E&s;tate follow the heart.

<P><HI>ANGELS</HI> can give to God no more than this, the entire Love and Obedi|ence of their hearts, <HI>We</HI> may do this, by the help of Divine Grace, as well as they.

<P N="2">2. WE are the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God e|minently or only in our <HI>Souls,</HI> not call'd &s;o with re&s;pect to our <HI>Bodies</HI> or outward Form.

<P>AND this is the manner of Rea&s;on|ing in our <HI>Context;</HI> that it is ab&s;urd to wor&s;hip the invi&s;ible and immen&s;e. SPIRIT, that <HI>gives to all Life and Breath and all things,</HI> under any dead and bodily Form, whether of Man or Bea&s;t; for <HI>in HIM we live &amp; move,</HI>

<P N="3">3. IT mu&s;t moreover be premi&s;ed &amp; con&s;idered, That <HI>Angels</HI> and humane <HI>Souls,</HI> though va&s;tly in their Nature excelling Bodies and bearing the I|mage of the Invi&s;ible God; yet they are as much at la&s;t the <HI>Creatures</HI> of God and infinitely <HI>below</HI> Him, as any and every part of the inferior World. At la&s;t the di&s;tance is infinite be|tween God and the highe&s;t created Intelligence. There is no propor|tion between Finite and Infinite: there is no mea&s;uring that which is Eternal and which is Immen&s;e. An eternal Exi&s;tence is ju&s;t the &s;ame to a million Years before the World, as to a million after it: And &s;o is an immen&s;e Pre&s;ence ju&s;t the &s;ame to the Heaven of heavens and to this Hou&s;e which we are in. That is to &s;ay, There is neither greater not le&s;s if compared to Infinity: the Heaven of heavens do no more contain God than this Room can. In like manner the highe&s;t created Beings are but
<PB N="95" REF="003010_0049_0FEF9DD6C80851F8">Creatures, and the lea&s;t Worm or Mire is one of Gods Creatures. If therefore &s;ome of God's Creatures are call'd his Offspring, what then? they are never the le&s;s as much below the eternal and immen&s;e <HI>Creator,</HI> as the lea&s;t and lowe&s;t thing that he has made. Wherefore <HI>He putteth no Tru&s;t in his Angels, he charge them with Folly, they cover their Faces before Him; the Heavens are not clean in his &s;ight.</HI> And as for the Spirits in Fle&s;h, what are they but <HI>Du&s;t and A&s;hes</HI> be|fore Him? as <HI>Abraham</HI> beheld him|&s;elf, when God &s;pake to him, and gave him leave to &s;peak before him. &mdash; As our <HI>Context</HI> has it, &mdash; <HI>God that made the World and all things in it, &s;ee|ing he is Lord of Heaven and Earth,</HI> is as much above the highe&s;t as the lea&s;t of his Creatures. So then, al|though our Souls are the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God, yet pride mu&s;t be hid from Man, and he is before his Maker but a Worm of the du&s;t. <HI>Lucifer,</HI> the Son of the Morning, in his high &s;tate
<PB N="96" REF="003010_0050_0FEF961120DF5438">grew proud, not con&s;idering that his di&s;tance from the Throne of the <HI>Ma|je&s;ty on High,</HI> was as great as if he had been the lea&s;t of Angels or only a Spirit here below in fle&s;h; and &s;o he fell &mdash;. But having &s;aid <HI>this</HI> to keep us low under the Priviledges of our Nature and the Favours of God to us; I come now to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="4">4. YET it plea&s;es the High God to <HI>call</HI> &s;ome of his Creatures <HI>his Off|&s;pring,</HI> and to require them &s;o to ac|count of &amp; e&s;teem Them&s;elves. <HI>For we are his Offspring.</HI></P>
<P>ANGELS and Men may &s;ay this. They <HI>both</HI> are &s;o. God calls them &s;o, owns them &s;o, puts them among his Children.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>ANGELS</HI> are the <HI>Sons</HI> of God. Job 38.7. <HI>When the Morning Stars &s;ang together and all the Sons of God &s;houted for Joy.</HI> i. e. The Angels did &s;o when God made this Earth of ours. The ble&s;&s;ed Angels are among Crea|tures, the <HI>Fir&s;t born of the Father of lights;</HI> and they &s;hone bright in the <HI>Morning</HI> of time; before that God
<PB N="97" REF="003010_0050_0FEF961120DF5438">commanded <HI>the Light to &s;hine out of Darkne&s;s</HI> here below. They &s;aw God rear the Earth for Men their younger <HI>Brethren,</HI> immortal Spirits like them&s;elves; and they rejoiced at it; (in the habitable parts where|of the <HI>Son</HI> of God was before re|joicing.) The holy <HI>Angels</HI> &s;hine bright in the <HI>Image</HI> of God; love him as their <HI>Father,</HI> he delights in them as his <HI>Sons,</HI> their delight is to do his <HI>Will,</HI> they dwell in his <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> above, and they inherit everla&s;ting Life and Light.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>MAN</HI> was created a <HI>Son</HI> of God as well as the Angels. So we read, Luk. 3. ult. <HI>Adam, which was the Son of God. He</HI> was immediately the Off|&s;pring of God in his Creation; <HI>We</HI> are mediately, Deut. 32.6. <HI>Is he not thy Father? hath he not made thee?</HI> Mal. 2.10. <HI>Have we not all our Father? hath not one God created us?</HI></P>

<P N="6">6. ARE we the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God? &s;ee how <HI>the Grace of God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as revealed in the Go&s;pel; agrees both to the Original and lap&s;ed State of Man as it is given us by Mo&s;es.</HI> There is an admirable Harmony between the <HI>Two Te&s;taments,</HI> the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New;</HI> And they give in a marvellous Light, and bear a &s;trong Te&s;timony, the one to the other.

<P N="1">1. <HI>THE redeeming Mercy of God by Chri&s;t admirably agrees to the Doctrine of mans Original State;</HI> that he was made in the Likene&s;s of God, and in his Love, and perfectly good &amp; hap|py, and in &s;hort a <HI>Son</HI> of God. For what is it that Chri&s;t by the Go&s;pel propo&s;es, but to recover us into the Favour and Grace of God; and into the Relation, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gnity and Priviledges
<PB N="146" REF="003010_0075_0FEF9E21093F0CD8">of Children to God. For the whole De&s;ign and Scope of the Go&s;pel is to make us again the <HI>Children</HI> of God. <HI>This</HI> it propo&s;es to us, the Way to this it reveals to us, and in its &s;aving Ef|ficacy this it produces in us and for us. It reveals to us a gracious Adop|tion in Chri&s;t, a ble&s;&s;ed Way for our Reconciliation to God, by a ble&s;&s;ed Regeneration and Renovation pa&s;&s;ing on us. It tells us of our being <HI>born again, renewed after the Image of God in Knowledge and Holine&s;s;</HI> it &s;hews and teaches the Spirit and Di&s;po&s;ition of Children which God is ready to re&s;tore in us. It would beget in us the Love of Children to God, &amp; bring us into the ready Obedience of Chil|dren; and it would bring us into the Communion of Children with God; to be known of God, and lov'd by him; to conver&s;e with him, hear his voice, &s;peak to him, walk before him, &amp; live with him for ever and ever. &mdash; Thus on the one hand <HI>the Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Go&s;pel Grace</HI> agree unto the Account given

<P N="2">2. IT agrees al&s;o to the Account given us of <HI>Mans Fall and of his lap&s;ed State;</HI> in being a Doctrine &amp; Precept of <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>FOR if Man be the <HI>Offspring of</HI> God, and be <HI>fallen</HI> from <HI>God,</HI> it mu&s;t needs be that the way of his Recovery and Return to God be by an ingenuous and deep Repentance: And if God be a <HI>Father</HI> to Man by Nature, as his Crea|tor, and he will plea&s;e to become his Father again by <HI>Grace</HI> after his Sin and Fall, we may be a&s;&s;ured then of the Sinning Creatures Reception and Pardon upon his Repentance. And ac|cordingly the Go&s;pel addre&s;&s;es unto lap&s;ed Man.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT invites and calls him to <HI>Re|pentance.</HI> And 2. It a&s;&s;ures him of Gods <HI>Pardoning Mercy</HI> upon his Re|pentance. A <HI>Penitential Return</HI> to God is the lea&s;t that can be enjoyned on the <HI>Sinning Offspring;</HI> and the Re|pentance
<PB N="148" REF="003010_0076_0FEF9E247AD789A0">which the Go&s;pel requires is a <HI>filial</HI> Repentance, &s;uch as becomes Children to an offended Father: A filial Fear and Shame and Sorrow.

God pardons like a <HI>Father,</HI> freely,
<PB N="149" REF="003010_0076_0FEF9E247AD789A0">fully and for ever; and mo&s;t tenderly and affectionately.
