<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON viewing the following Relati|on, the Goodne&s;s of a merciful God appeared to have waited on the &s;aid <HI>John Hammett</HI> from time to time, and the Voice of Chri&s;t is plainly di&s;cerned to have drawn him from one Step to another, which for &s;ome Time he neither knew nor &s;tedfa&s;tly believed to be divine: But as <HI>Samuel</HI> mi&s;took when God cal|led him in the Temple, &s;uppo&s;ing the Voice he heard was <HI>Eli</HI>'s, he repair'd to him, but was &s;ent back, being in part informed of his mi&s;|take. The Voice he heard again and again, and <HI>Samuel</HI> makes his &s;econd and third At|tempt to know <HI>Eli</HI>'s Will. The old Man now perceiving that it was the Lord's Voice, gave him In&s;truction how to an&s;wer; and if <HI>John Hammett</HI> had met with &s;uch happy Advice from his Brethren the bapti&s;ts, he had not been rein&s;tated among&s;t them as a Mini&s;ter after that religious Scruple, which was of the Lord's begetting, tho' they in a mi&s;take took it to be a delu&s;ion of Satan. And it can't be otherwi&s;e look'd upon in them than a mi&s;take, who no doubt ima|gine them&s;elves to be in the Purity of Religion tho' 'tis to be feared too many content them|&s;elves in the Symbols thereof, refu&s;ing, it's
<PB REF="002877_0003_0FE6847E066A8460">
doubted, to come to the Word of Faith and Spi|rit of Christ in their Hearts, <HI>that they might have Life;</HI> that <HI>Life which is the Light of Men.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, We request all to take <HI>John Hammett</HI>'s Example, on the like Unea&s;ine&s;s and religious Scruple, when they find it on their minds to bring their Principles and Practices to the Tryal on this Touch&s;tone of the Go&s;pel, <HI>the Word of Faith in their Hearts,</HI> as <HI>John Hammett</HI> hath done. Thus will they be able rightly to understand the holy Scriptures, and apply them to their own Experience; and will infallibly &s;ee whether they are in a State of Salvation or Reproba|tion, concerning the Faith of Chri&s;t. And that this may be their Practice and Experience, even to the Salvation of their Souls, and not only theirs, but Thou&s;ands and tens of Thou|&s;ands, is our fervent De&s;ire and Prayer, who in much Sincerity are Lovers of, and Well-wi&s;hers to the Souls of all Men.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEREAS the Bap|ti&s;ts had a Letter of mine in their Hands, which &s;ome Years pa&s;t I &s;ent to one <HI>John Wright,</HI> which hath been lately printed and cryed about the Streets; and the Publi&s;her of the &s;aid Letter hath taken the Liberty at the Time of printing it to add the following Lines of his own in the Front of it, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002877_0005_0FE6847040FF3408"><Q>A Letter from <HI>John Hammett</HI> to <HI>John Wright,</HI> giving an Account why <HI>John John Hammett</HI> turned from the Bapti&s;ts to the Quakers; al&s;o why he turned back again: Wherein are di&s;covered the Devices and Temptations of the Devil. Publi&s;hed from his own Hand Writing, for a Caution and Information to all un+&s;teady Profe&s;&s;ors.</Q></P>
<P>Though I don't determine what De&s;igns the publi&s;her of the &s;aid Letter had, in inventing and publi&s;hing this Addition, but rather choo&s;e to &s;ubmit the Con&s;ide|ration of it to others; yet I &s;hall venture to &s;ay, that the Addition it &s;elf is in &s;eve|ral Re&s;pects very unfair, and in Fact an ab&s;olute Fal&s;hood; for the Letter to which the above mentioned Addition refers, gives not the lea&s;t Account why I turned from the Bapti&s;ts to the Quakers, and why I turned back again, as the Publi&s;her in his Addition &s;o po&s;&s;itively affirms it to do: Neither was there any &s;uch thing in Reali|ty; for I had not turn'd to, or join'd with the Quakers till &s;ome Years after the writing of the &s;aid Letter: Neither did I ever turn back again to the Bapti&s;ts, or had any Inclination &s;o to do, &s;ince I turned to,
<PB N="3" REF="002877_0006_0FE684789E1A6BC0">
or joined with the People called Quakers.</P>
<P>And though the &s;aid Letter is now pub|li&s;hed almo&s;t Six Years &s;ince the Date of it, as may be &s;een by the Letter it &s;elf, yet tho&s;e who read the &s;aid Addition (who are not acquainted with my pre&s;ent Stati|on) will readily conclude, from the Man|ner of it, that at the Time of its publica|tion I was with the Bapti&s;ts, (as when the &s;aid Letter was written;) and if &s;o, the Conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be, that I publi&s;h'd the &s;aid Letter and Addition my &s;elf; when|as at the time of the Publication of the &s;aid Letter, and &s;ome Years before, I was &s;eparated from the Bapti&s;ts, and joined to the People called Quakers.</P>
<P>And tho' I am not angry with the Bap|ti&s;ts upon Account of the &s;aid Letters being publi&s;hed, nor upon any other Account what&s;oever, but &s;incerely de&s;ire their Sal|vation, and have always behaved my &s;elf like a peaceable Chri&s;tian towards them; yet I think a mode&s;t Defence of my &s;elf, when I apprehend my &s;elf &s;o much obli|ged to it, can't but be excu&s;able: And therefore I &s;hall farther endeavour &s;o to do, by publi&s;hing the Relation following; wherein I intend in a brief Manner, to &s;et forth how I came to withdraw from the Bapti&s;ts Communion: and how I was pre|vailed
<PB N="4" REF="002877_0007_0FE6846CA4D277C8">
upon to join with them again; al&s;o how I came to &s;eparate my &s;elf from them, and join my &s;elf to the People called Quakers.</P>
<P>After I had been in Communion with the Bapti&s;ts for almo&s;t twenty Years, and my &s;elf with the re&s;t of my Brethren be|ing as zealous for &s;upporting and main|taining the outward Figures now common|ly practiced, as the Jews were for the Ceremonies of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and al&s;o as cen&s;ori|ous again&s;t all tho&s;e who conformed not exactly to us, as they were again&s;t their Fellow Chri&s;tians who conformed not to them, at length it plea&s;ed God to put it into my Mind to enquire into my &s;piri|tual State; and an Eye was opened in me to &s;ee, that notwith&s;tanding my zealou&s;ly pleading for, and diligently performing tho&s;e outward Symbols, yet according, to their proper Nature, they brought forth only an <HI>outward, lifele&s;s Religion,</HI> and pro|ved far from being the Means of <HI>inward &s;piritual Grace,</HI> as they are generally cal|led and e&s;teemed to be: Al&s;o I came to apprehend, that the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t</HI> is the only Means of <HI>inward and &s;piritual Grace.</HI> And when I came thus far to my &s;elf, and to the Exerci&s;e of my Spiritual Sen&s;es, I clearly di&s;cern'd, that for a long Time I had been feeding on the barren Mountains of a formal, lifele&s;s Religion, and upon
<PB N="5" REF="002877_0008_0FE68467493139C8">
the Prodigal's Husks, that could not fill his Belly nor mine; the Apprehen&s;ion whereof brought a great Concern and Ex|erci&s;e upon my Spirit, greatly de&s;iring to attain to a more inward &s;piritual Religion, whereby I might be made a true and ex|perimental Witne&s;s of the &s;aving Work of Grace, and of the Offices and Performances of Chri&s;t which I had read of in the Scrip|tures; and that my Soul might be brought into Union and Communion with God, and be daily fed and nouri&s;hed with the Bread and Water of Life, and to enjoy the Ma|nife&s;tation of the Life giving Pre&s;ence of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then I enquired into the outward In&s;titutions, (that is,) whe|ther they were &s;ub&s;tantial Things in them|&s;elves, and of a durable Nature, or whe|ther they were originally intended figura|tively to guide the Minds of People to the more inward &s;piritual Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel, and then to expire in Point of Obligation, like the legal Ceremonies; and I came to this Conclu&s;ion, that the latter was intended: And this I well re|member, that as I grew le&s;s outward and formal, I grew more inward and &s;piritual, and experienced a more near Acquaintance with God; whereby I began to be weaned from the&s;e outward Performances. And not enjoying that &s;piritual Life and Satis|faction among the Bapti&s;ts which I de&s;ir'd
<PB N="6" REF="002877_0009_0FE68489279777B0">
and longed for, I was con&s;trained to with|draw from them. And &s;ome Time after, as I was con&s;idering where I might find a People among&s;t whom I might enjoy what I wanted, it plea&s;ed God to encline my Mind towards the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and ac|cordingly I went two or three Times to their Meeting: And when the Bapti&s;ts under&s;tood that I was enclining towards the Quakers, they came often to vi&s;it me, and &s;ome of them, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, treated me with a tender Spirit; but the Generality of them carryed them&s;elves far otherwi&s;e; for they were almo&s;t continu|ally filling my Ears with the Sound of my being led away by Satan, and that tho&s;e inward Workings were nothing but diabo|lical Delu&s;ions; al&s;o often repeating and applying to me abundance of the mo&s;t dreadful Denunciations in the Scriptures, and repre&s;enting the Quakers in &s;everal Re&s;pects to be a delu&s;ive, erronious Peo|ple. By this Means I was brought into great Confu&s;ion; for when I look'd to|wards the Quakers, who I was &s;en&s;ible made a more religious and &s;piritual Ap|pearance than any others, my Mind and Affections inclined towards them; but the many Prejudices which I was filled with again&s;t them, together with the heavy
<PB N="7" REF="002877_0010_0FE684701B250150">
Cro&s;s that I mu&s;t unavoidably take up, and the frightful mountainous Difficulties that lay in my Way, greatly di&s;couraged me from going forward; whereupon I was afraid to go to their Meetings, or much to enquire into their Principles: And when I look'd back on the Bapti&s;ts, I con&s;ider'd that I had been in Unity with them almo&s;t twenty Years, and during all that time there aro&s;e no Difference be|tweeen them and me; which I found had begotten a great Affection towards them: And on the other Hand I dreaded to make them my Enemies, who had &s;o long been my Friends; whereupon I found a great Difficulty to &s;eparate my &s;elf wholly from them, and join my &s;elf to the Quakers, with whom I never had any religious Ac|quaintance; whereupon I drew to this Conclu&s;ion, neither to go to the Meetings of the Bapti&s;ts or Quakers, and knew not but that I &s;hould &s;pend the Remainder of my Days in this lone&s;ome &s;eparate State: And being brought into many Dif|ficulties in &s;everal Re&s;pects, I began to be weary of my Life, and e&s;pecially when I found my Mind inclining toward the Qua|kers; in&s;omuch that tho&s;e divine Draw|ings became more terrible than Death it &s;elf. Sometimes I feared I &s;hould lo&s;e my
<PB N="8" REF="002877_0011_0FE68478C030DBD0">
natural Under&s;tanding; for I could neither eat, drink, or &s;leep but very little for &s;e|veral Days and Nights together, whereby I was in Time reduced almo&s;t to a Con|&s;umption, and thrown into a very great Inflamation; and in my Di&s;tre&s;s &s;ometimes petitioned the Lord rather to take my Life from me than to encline me toward the Quakers; at other Times the Enemy would tempt me to put an End to my temporal Life, to get rid of my &s;piritual Troubles; and &s;ometimes I was very near being over|come by him, but it plea&s;ed the Lord in great Mercy to re&s;train me; and in time I was quite tired out with this mi&s;erable Condition, and began to look back and confer with the Fle&s;h and the World, and often &s;trove again&s;t tho&s;e divine Convicti|ons, until it plea&s;ed God to withdraw tho&s;e Influences from me; and then in that dark and bewilder'd State I look'd back with the Eyes of my carnal Rea&s;on, which cannot comprehend <HI>the Things of the Spi|rit of God,</HI> and to which the <HI>Wi&s;dom of God &s;eems Fooli&s;hne&s;s,</HI> and began to ima|gine tho&s;e divine Vi&s;itations and Workings to be the Delu&s;ions of Satan; being there|unto greatly forwarded and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Bapti&s;ts, who were my only Companions, and almo&s;t continually filling my Ears and
<PB N="9" REF="002877_0012_0FE6849EF47B8FE8">
Thoughts with Abundance of Di&s;cour&s;e of that Nature; &s;o that by this Means I began to be in an ea&s;y quiet Frame again, in re&s;pect of my latter Difficulties; and the Bapti&s;ts being now &s;en&s;ible what their diligent Endeavours had effected, they were under Encouragement of my returning to their Communion, and altered their Man|ner of Treatment, carrying them&s;elves very loving and courteous towards me; which begat Thoughts in me of joining with them again: And as this Inclinati|on prevailed, my Affection towards the outward Performances increa&s;ed likewi&s;e, which cau&s;ed me to &s;peak favourably of them again, whereby I &s;oon recovered re|&s;pect again, not only from the Bapti&s;ts, but al&s;o from others of other Denominati|ons, &s;ome of whom al&s;o u&s;ed their zealous Endeavours to di&s;encline me from the Quakers; and being therewith greatly plea|&s;ed, I endeavoured &s;trongly to oppo&s;e all Thoughts that would come into my Mind again&s;t the outward Figures, and al&s;o to cheri&s;h and &s;trengthen all Inclinations to|wards them; till at length I had got a great E&s;teem of them again; and being thereunto often per&s;waded, I was again united to the Bapti&s;ts Communion, and
<PB N="10" REF="002877_0013_0FE6847DE38AE080">
not long after I writ the Letter before men|tioned: And when I had &s;pent &s;ome Time in Unity with the Bapti&s;ts, I was by the unanimous Approbation of the Meeting re|&s;tored to my former Station of a Mini&s;ter, and &s;o continued for a con&s;iderable Time; till at length I began to ob&s;erve, that ever &s;ince I was re-united to the Bapti&s;ts Com|munion, I had &s;at down contented and ea&s;y under formal, lifele&s;s Principles and Performances, and had not enjoy'd that in|ward Spiritual Life which &s;ome Time before I had a Ta&s;te of, and that my Un|der&s;tanding and Apprehen&s;ion grew more dark and carnal, the Lord having &s;ome Time before withdrawn his divine Light, by which my &s;piritual Eye di&s;cerned, and left me to the Exerci&s;e of my humane Rea&s;on; &s;o that my Apprehen&s;ions of &s;pi|ritual Things were formed and determined accordingly.</P>
<P>At length it plea&s;ed God to begin to open my Under&s;tanding in &s;ome &s;piri|tual Doctrines; and as I &s;aw further, I &s;poke plainer, at which they were offend|ed, and &s;aid, <HI>I preach'd up Quaker Doc|trine, and if I went on, I would bring in Quakeri&s;m among them:</HI> I told them, <HI>I knew the Lord was in&s;piring my Mind with
<PB N="11" REF="002877_0014_0FE6849F168E1028">
divine Under&s;tanding, and the more I &s;earch'd the Scriptures, the more I was con|&s;umed therein, and therefore could not be confined to &s;uch Doctrines as plea&s;ed them, but mu&s;t perform my Duty according as the Lord would be plea&s;ed to open my Under|&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>And now I was brought into a great Difficulty again, and con&s;idered what I had be&s;t to do; whereupon (though it may be my Weakne&s;s) I drew to this Conclu&s;ion, rather to be wholly &s;ilent than rai&s;e a Di&s;turbance, and &s;o continued for &s;ome Time: Then it was brought to my Con|&s;ideration again what a dull, lifele&s;s Frame I was in, notwith&s;tanding my zealous and diligent Performance of the outward Ob|&s;ervations; and in this contemplative Frame the Lord was plea&s;ed to encline my Mind again towards the Quakers, very contrary to my Expectation or De&s;ire, the Apprehen&s;ion whereof greatly &s;urpri&s;ed me; for the many Difficulties that lay in my Way came into my Mind like an overflow|ing Inundation. The Bapti&s;ts ob&s;erving my melancholy di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition, enquired the Rea&s;on of it, which I was free to in|form them; then they came often to vi&s;it me again, &s;ome treating me &s;moothly, and
<PB N="12" REF="002877_0015_0FE684A1195EA8D0">
&s;ome roughly. I told them, I had now wholly committed my &s;elf to God for his Directions, and had a Faith and Hope rai|&s;ed in me, that he would make me &s;en&s;i|ble what his Plea&s;ure was concerning me; that I had re&s;olv'd to have no Regard to any mortal Creature, and intended not to be led by fair Means, nor driven by foul, and de&s;ign'd not to be confus'd as I had been, and therefore de&s;ir'd them to be wholly &s;ilent, and let me alone. Then I kept &s;everal Days of Fa&s;ting and Pray|er to God for his Direction, that he would be plea&s;ed to di&s;cover to me, whether tho&s;e Drawings proceeded from him or from Satan, the which I could not now di&s;tingui&s;h to my Satisfaction; &s;o that I was in great Fear and Trembling: I thought if this Inclination proceeded from Satan, I &s;hould be undone, If I went for|ward in Obedience to him; and if it was from God, I al&s;o trembled at the Thoughts of keeping back and being di&s;obedient to him; therefore I concluded to keep my Mind in a &s;till, quiet, pa&s;&s;ive Frame, re|&s;olving to &s;tand &s;till, and neither &s;tep for|ward nor backward, but re&s;ign my &s;elf up to God, patiently to wait for his Appear|ance and Direction.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002877_0016_0FE6847A376146D0">At length it plea&s;ed God to &s;hine into my Heart by his divine, re&s;plendent Light, to my great Joy and Satisfaction; and at the &s;ame Time renewed my Inclination to|ward the Quakers: And finding my Mind growing very unea&s;y and di&s;atisfied again among&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, I had Thoughts of going to the Quaker's Meeting; but cal|ling to Remembrance my former Mi&s;ma|nagement, I thought I would now be more deliberate, and make no Alteration but on a more &s;olid and thorough Examination.</P>
<P>Then I &s;et my &s;elf again to examine into the Bapti&s;ts Principles and Perfor|mances; and the more I &s;earched the more Cau&s;e of Di&s;atisfaction I di&s;cover|ed; for I plainly di&s;cerned, that the Ten|dency thereof was to lay the Soul down, and lull it a&s;leep on lifele&s;s Principles and Performances, and many of them were &s;uch as I could not &s;tand by or maintain. Then I thought I would enquire into the Quakers Principles; but I &s;oon found that the Prejudices which I had received from the Repre&s;entations of <HI>Keith, Bugg, Hox, Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> and others, greatly unqualified me for an Impartial Enquiry. Then I con&s;idered that the&s;e were all their pro|fe&s;t Adver&s;arys, and it may be they may
<PB N="14" REF="002877_0017_0FE684A1411ADE10">
mi&s;repre&s;ent them; and I was the rather inclin'd to think &s;o, becau&s;e I had then by me a Book of <HI>Keith</HI>'s, writ again&s;t the Quakers wherein I found he plainly owns in one part what he denies in another, affirms, and then contradicts him&s;elf; and from this Piece of ab&s;olute Confu&s;ion and Self-contradiction I was in&s;tructed to lay by all Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Prejudices, and enquire of them&s;elves, whom I thought be&s;t know their own Principles&punc; I got &s;ome of their Books, which contain'd a Declaration of their Principles, and in my impartial Enquiry I found them gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented; for their Principles were all &s;ub&s;tantially proved by the Scrip|tures, and that the proper Tendency of them was to promote a &s;piritual, pure, and holy Life, and to bring the Souls that are led by them into Unity and Communion with God, and to &s;et forth the Power and Glory of the Go&s;pel Di&s;|pen&s;ation. And though I once thought this People to be the mo&s;t weak and ig|norant of all, I found them in &s;piritual Under&s;tanding and Experience to be the wi&s;e&s;t of all; and admir'd my own for|mer Ignorance, in Compari&s;on of that admirable Under&s;tanding I found among&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="002877_0018_0FE684A5ADA45B50">
them. Then I &s;et my &s;elf to enquire in|to their Con&s;titution, Orders and Di&s;ci|pline, and found the Conclu&s;ion far be|yond my Expectation; for tho' I have read the Con&s;titution, Orders and Di&s;ci|pline, of mo&s;t of the reformed Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> yet I can truly declare, that I believe this People in all Re&s;pects to be the mo&s;t harmonious, religious, and perfect, of any religious Body of People on the Face of the Earth: So that the more I &s;aw the more I admir'd, and &s;aid in my Heart, <HI>Is this the People that are &s;o de&s;pi&s;ed by all, that all Denominations of Chri&s;tians, though greatly oppo&s;ing one another, yet all combine again&s;t this People?</HI> The Rea&s;on I appre|hend to be in part, that their Principles and Con&s;titution are built on the Wi&s;|dom of God revealed unto them by his Spirit, that &s;earcheth the deep things of God; and others beholding them with the Eye of humane Rea&s;on, which can|not under&s;tand the Things of the Spirit of God, and to which the Wi&s;dom of God &s;eems Fooli&s;hne&s;s they cannnot be com|prehended until a &s;piritual Eye is open|ed in them that behold them; and al&s;o their Principles and Con&s;titution tending above all others to exalt the Kingdom of
<PB N="16" REF="002877_0019_0FE684A5D03C6710">
Chri&s;t, and to de&s;troy the Kingdom of Satan, he fills the World with Prejudices again&s;t them; and becau&s;e they are not of the World, but are cho&s;en by Chri&s;t out of the World, to te&s;tify that the Works thereof are evil, therefore the World hateth them. Then I could be|hold them and &s;ay, <HI>How goodly are thy Tents, O Jacob, and thy Tabernacles, O I&s;|rael!</HI> And yet the many great Difficul|ties that lay in my Way, detained me among the Bapti&s;ts. At length, one Morn|ing as I was in the Bapti&s;ts Meeting, I found an exceeding powerful Vi&s;itation of God, &s;trongly enclining my Mind, and the in&s;hining Light of Chri&s;t directing me towards the Quakers; &s;o that I could hardly &s;it out the Meeting. This Vi&s;ita|tion conquered all carnal rea&s;oning and fle&s;hly Conference, and rai&s;ed in me a fix|ed Re&s;olution, in the Strength of the Lord, to bear the Cro&s;s and de&s;pi&s;e the Shame, and come what would, I would no longer delay, but give up to the Di|vine Influence; and in the Afternoon I went to the Quakers Meeting, where I ob&s;erved the &s;olid grave Compo&s;edne&s;s, and humble Deportment of the People, who plainly di&s;covered their Minds were

given up to the Bu&s;ine&s;s their Mini&s;ters declared they were met for, (that is,) <HI>to wor&s;hip God in Spirit and Sincerity.</HI></P>
<P>I had not come long to their Meetings, being emptied of Partiality and Prejudice, but found what I long'd to enjoy, to my great Joy and Satisfaction, which was the Crown and Glory of all, that God was ma|nife&s;tly among them, making their Meet|ings and Wor&s;hip refre&s;hing and &s;trength|ening to the Soul; whereby I was prevail|ed upon to join my &s;elf in &s;piritual Unity with them, and can truly declare, for the Encouragement of all other religious En|quirers, that the Lord upon a &s;piritual Account, hath fully &s;atisfied me for all the Troubles and Difficulties I have pa&s;s'd through: To whom, for all his Ble&s;&s;ings and merciful Dealings towards me, be rendred as His Due, and my Duty, <HI>Thanks|giving, Glory and Prai&s;e, for ever,</HI> AMEN.</P>
