<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Di&s;cour&s;es are a <HI>hurried</HI> At|tempt to &s;ave a &s;inking Land. The Author was on a long Journey, when he received the Confirmation of the melancholy News from the <HI>Ohio;</HI> and he had but two Days to prepare for the Pulpit, after his Return. And as it was judged proper by many immediately to publi&s;h the Sermons, he had no Time to revi&s;e and tran&s;cribe them for the Pre&s;s: For the Country now being in a very uncertain and fluctuating State, a Di&s;cour&s;e adapted to its pre&s;ent Situation, may be improper a few Month&s;s, or even a few Weeks hence. To &s;pend Time about Embelli&s;hment, at &s;uch a Juncture, would be egregious Trifling.</P>
<P>The Account of the Drought, I know to be true; and Thou&s;ands will be &s;en&s;ible that it is not aggravated. The Account of the fatal Ac|tion at the <HI>Ohio,</HI> is founded upon the be&s;t Intel|ligences I could get; and if there be a few cir|cum&s;tantial Mi&s;takes, the Sub&s;tance is undoubt|edly true.</P>
<P>As many of our Countrymen are &s;tupidly in|in&s;en&s;ible of their Danger, and cannot exert them|&s;elves
<PB N="iv" REF="007644_0003_102D983C0961C778">for their own Defence, 'til they are a|larmed; and as but few &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to view the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Affairs in a <HI>religious</HI> Light; the Author had impatiently looked for &s;omething of this Kind from &s;ome more ma&s;terly and lei&s;urely Hand. But being di&s;appointed, and &s;urrounded with Importunities from various Quarters, he thought him&s;elf obliged to undertake it, tho' under peculiar Di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>If it may but contribute to the Safety of his Country, and to the Reformation of his Fellow-Subjects, his End in this Attempt, as well as his De&s;ires and Prayers, will be an&s;wered.</P>

<P>P. S. Feb. 14, 1756. <HI>The following Di&s;cour&s;es were &s;ent to the Pre&s;s a few Days after the News of the Defeat at Monongahala. But the Pre&s;s be|ing nece&s;&s;arily employed about other Things, and other unfore&s;een Ob&s;tructions happening in the Printers Way, the Publication was unavoidably de|layed. But it is hoped, it is not now impertinent nor un&s;ea&s;onable; as no very con&s;iderable Alterati|on has happened in our public Affairs, except the Victory obtained by the brave Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> at <HI>Lake-George;</HI> which was a great Encouragement to us, tho' not a deci&s;ive Stroke.</HI></P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>AMOS iii. 1&mdash;6.</HI></BIBL> Hear this Word that the Lord hath &s;poken again&s;t you, O Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> a|gain&s;t the whole Family which I brought up from the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> &s;aying, You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth; therefore I will puni&s;h you for all your Iniquities. Can two walk together, except they be agreed? Will a Lion roar in the Fore&s;t, when he hath no Prey? Will a young Lion cry out of his Den, if he have taken nothing? Can a Bird fall in a Snare upon the Earth, where no Gin is for him? Shall one take up a Snare from the Earth, and have taken nothing at all? Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid? Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF my late Journey deprived me of Lei&s;ure to make proper Preparations for your Entertain|ment To-day; I mu&s;t own, it has helped me not a little, in furni&s;hing me with Materials adapted to this melancholy Sea&s;on. I have &s;een the Staff of
<PB N="6" REF="007644_0005_102D9841322BA890">Life ju&s;t broken in mo&s;t Places; in a Tour of about an hundred Miles
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thro' the Counties of <HI>Hanover, Goochland, Albemarle, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> The Fields which were wont to look green and flouri&s;hing with our Staple Commodity
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tobacco.</NOTE>, on which our Trade &s;o entirely de|pends, I have &s;een prepared with Labour and Pain, but unplanted, or the Plants parched and fading, I have &s;een the Fields, that in former Sea&s;ons pro|mi&s;ed abundant Support for Man and Bea&s;t, and were rich in &s;tately, blooming Corn, now withering, and hardly promi&s;ing a few &s;aple&s;s Leaves for our Cattle, and a few hu&s;ky Ears for our&s;elves. I have &s;een the Planter, that was once &s;urrounded with Affluence, pointing to his empty withering Fields, and ready to &s;mite upon his Brea&s;t, and &s;ay, "Ala&s;s! what &s;hall I do for Corn to &s;upport my Family next Year? I would ju&s;t now &s;ell &s;ome of my Slaves, or any Thing in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that at an Under-Rate, to purcha&s;e a &s;ure Supply, if I knew where to get it." This Scarcity is the more threatning, as <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> the Granary of <HI>America,</HI> has al&s;o &s;uffered &s;everely by the Drought. And as the numerous <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> depend upon that Province for a Supply of Wheat, and upon us for Corn; they will al&s;o have a deep Share with the Colonies on the Continent in the Effects of this unfruitful Sea&s;on. Indeed there are but few Parts of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, but will be &s;en&s;ibly affected by it, more or le&s;s. It &s;eems to be a wide-extended circulating Di&s;tre&s;s; and we &s;hould feel it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a general Complaint of the Stagna|tion of Trade, the Scarcity of Money, the Weight
<PB N="7" REF="007644_0006_102D9842CA56DDA8">of the various Taxes, the high Price of Goods, and the low Price of your Staple Commodities: And &s;ome poor Families are already in the very Jaws of Famine, and the Children crying for Bread, and there is ju&s;t none for them. What op|pre&s;&s;ive, complicated Calamities are the&s;e? Your own Circum&s;tances will teach you Sympathy in this Ca&s;e; or if any of you are &s;o happy as to be free from &s;ome of them, you have your Share in others of them; and this mu&s;t affect you with Con|cern for your&s;elves, and Compa&s;&s;ion for others, on whom the whole Burden may fall with greater Op|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Were the&s;e Calamities <HI>&s;ingle</HI> and <HI>alone,</HI> we could not but feel and lament each of them. But when they are <HI>complicated</HI> and united, they are heavy in|deed; and this is the melancholy Ca&s;e of mo&s;t Parts of this Colony.&mdash;But Oh <HI>VIRGINIA!</HI> Oh my Country! even this Complication of Afflictions is not all thy Burden. Be&s;ides all this, we <Q>hear the Sound of the Trumpet, and &s;ee Garments rolled in Blood.</Q> We have received the melancholy Confirmation of the News we were &s;o unwilling to believe, concerning the Fate of a great Part of our Army. Our brave General is no more; near fifty of our be&s;t Officers, and near &s;ix hundred of our Men, are killed or wounded; an Army of one thou&s;and three hundred Men routed; and all this, (Oh indignant Mortification!) all this by four or five hundred undi&s;ciplined, cowardly, in&s;idious Sa|vages. Who can &s;o much as in Thought, take a Survey of the bloody Field, without all the tender and mournful Pa&s;&s;ions working within him? <Q>How
<PB N="8" REF="007644_0007_102D722A2ABE5E18">are the mighty fallen, and the Weapons of War peri&s;hed! Ye Banks of <HI>Monongahala,</HI> upon you let there be no Dew, neither let there be Rain upon you, nor Fields of Offerings: For there the the Shield of the Mighty is vilely ca&s;t away
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Sam.</HI> i. 21, 27.</NOTE>.</Q> See there the mighty Dead rolling in their own Blood! &s;ome of them &s;calped by mercile&s;s <HI>Indians,</HI> left without the Honors of Burial in a howling Wilderne&s;s, to be devoured by the Fowls of Hea|ven, and Bea&s;ts of Prey! See the wounded writh|ing with Pain, &s;urrounded with all the Terrors of Death, and groaning out their Life, in Amazement and Con&s;ternation; many dying of Wounds not mortal, if proper Care could have been taken of them! while the Remnant that e&s;cape, &s;hift for them&s;elves, and fly in the wilde&s;t Horror, thro' a barren Wilderne&s;s, without the Supports of Life! Who can realize &s;uch a Scene, without &s;haring in the Sufferings of the&s;e unhappy Men; e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, they &s;uffer for our Sake, <HI>i. e.</HI> for our own Defence; and whether we may not al&s;o add, they &s;uffer for <HI>our Sins,</HI> we &s;hall enquire pre&s;ently. To complete our Lo&s;s, our fine Artillery, Baggage, Hor&s;es, Wheel-Carriages, are de&s;troyed, or fallen into the Hands of our Enemies, to &s;trengthen and enrich them, and to weaken and impoveri&s;h us, The <HI>New-England</HI> Men indeed are pu&s;hing their Conque&s;ts wherever they turn, under the Smiles of Heaven, to which they look, and in which they tru&s;t; and this we &s;hould acknowledge with Grati|tude, as a &s;ingular Bluffing, and greatly tending to the Advantage of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies in general;
<PB N="9" REF="007644_0008_102D98456DF87690">but in another View, methinks it makes us more &s;en&s;ible of our peculiar Misfortunes and Mortifica|tion in this Colony; as tho' we were &s;ingled out to De&s;truction, and nothing could pro&s;per in which we are concerned And perhaps the Routing of the <HI>French</HI> in their Northern Settlements may cau&s;e them to over-run this Colony, in Order to make Repri|&s;als, and &s;et them on fighting from a &s;tronger Prin|ciple than Ambition, <HI>viz.</HI> a Care to provide a Place for them&s;elves to go to.</P>
<P>But even this is not all. I have the melancholy News to communicate to you, that &s;undry Families in our frontier Counties have been murdered by the barbarous <HI>Indians.</HI> They were a&s;leep in their Beds of Re&s;t, without dreaming of Danger; and the fir&s;t Thing that awakened them was the deadly Blow of the bloody Ax, or the dying Shrieks of a murdered Father, a Wife, or a Child. Some of them were carried Captive, and afterwards found in the Woods, mangled and half-rotten, with all the Marks of Barbarity and lei&s;urely Torture upon them; &s;calped or beheaded; <Q>their Women ripp'd up, and left in a Po&s;ture too mon&s;trous to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed, and even their <HI>Blood drank</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are the Words of a Letter from a Gentleman in <HI>Au|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> who was a Witne&s;s of the&s;e Scenes of unnatural Barbarity.</NOTE>.</Q> I al&s;o conver&s;ed with an Expre&s;s from <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> two or three Days ago, who told me, that a great Number of poor Families, that were ju&s;t begin|ning the World in the Wilderne&s;s, and had made flouri&s;hing Plantations there, were driven from their Hou&s;es by the Terror of the&s;e Barbarians, and had fled for Safety, in the wilde&s;t Con&s;terna|tion,
<PB N="10" REF="007644_0009_102D984778CB1BB8">over a long and tedious Tract of Rocks and Mountains, near two hundred Miles, into the more thickly inhabited Parts of the Country. There they now are, Men, Women and Children, with|out any Covering but the inclement Sky, expo&s;ed to the Dews of the Night, and the &s;corching Heat of the Day, without Bread, except what the Cha|rity of others affords them. For they were obliged to leave their plentiful Harve&s;ts behind them un|reaped; and they could carry with them but little of their Hou&s;hold Furniture, their Stock, or any of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: They were glad they could 'get their own Lives for a Prey. As for tho&s;e Fa|milies that live in the populous Parts of that Coun|ty, they are obliged to gather together into Forts, where the Women and Children continue in Crowds Night and Day; and the Men by Day venture out, tho' in con&s;tant Fear of their Lives, to look after their Farms, and make a little Provi&s;ion for their sub&s;i&s;tence; and as the Drought there is very &s;e|vere, it mu&s;t be a &s;canty Provi&s;ion indeed. In the&s;e Forts, which are very numerous in various Parts, they now meet to wor&s;hip God: And they dare not go up to the Sanctuary, without carrying their Arms along with them; and they are always in trembling Expectation to be &s;urprized by the Enemy.</P>
<P>Our happy Situation, about the Center of the Colony, has kept us hitherto in Peace and Safety. But it may not be always &s;o with us: The Inroads of the Enemy may reach even to us. Or if we &s;hould be di&s;turbed only by di&s;tant Alarms; yet the&s;e unhappy Creatures are proper Objects of our
<PB N="11" REF="007644_0010_102D9849F5925EE8">Compa&s;&s;ion, and of our Interce&s;&s;ion before God. They are our <HI>Brethren,</HI> Fellow-Chri&s;tians, and Members of the &s;ame <HI>Body politic</HI> with us: And it is in the Body politic, as in the <HI>natural Body;</HI> when <HI>one</HI> Member &s;uffers, <HI>all</HI> the Members &s;uffer with it. To all this I may add, the poor State of our Militia, which has hitherto been a mere Farce. &mdash;The Scarcity of Arms and Ammunition in the Country.&mdash;The &s;tupid Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or &s;neaking Cowardice, of not a few of our Inhabitants,&mdash;and the Danger of In&s;urrection and Ma&s;&s;acre from &s;ome of our own gloomy Dome&s;tics. And the&s;e are very alarming Circum&s;tances, that may ju&s;tly excite our Fears; though they are not de&s;perate; nor &s;hould they cau&s;e us to de&s;pond, and give up our&s;elves for lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I know I &s;hould mingle a great deal of chearful <HI>Light</HI> with the&s;e gloomy <HI>Shades,</HI> to form an exact Picture of the pre&s;ent State of our Country. Not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e Calamities, we &s;till enjoy a rich Variety of Ble&s;&s;ings. Though God is ri&s;en up to puni&s;h us, yet he does not puni&s;h us as our Ini|quities de&s;erve; nor &s;trip us of every Comfort. As yet, we enjoy Food and Raiment; and the Scarcity of one Part of the Country, is rendered more tole|rable by the Pro&s;pect of Plenty in other Parts, which have been refre&s;hed with Rain from Heaven: And even this threatning and melancholy Year, may yet compare with the mo&s;t fruitful and happy Years of &s;ome populous Countries on our Globe. Our Nor|thern Forces have more than made Repri&s;als for our Lo&s;s; and the Succe&s;s of our Fleet, under Admiral <HI>Bo&s;cawen,</HI> has given a con&s;iderable Blow to the
<PB N="12" REF="007644_0011_102D98503AA03D60">Power of <HI>France</HI> by Sea. Our Inhabitants are nu|merous, and &s;ome of them re&s;olute, and capable of making a good Defence; and a con&s;iderable Part of our Forces have &s;urvived the fatal Ninth of <HI>July,</HI> in which &s;o many of them were &s;laughtered. The&s;e and &s;undry other Things have an encouraging Appearance; and we cannot overlook them without Ingratitude, and exce&s;&s;ive De&s;pondence. But not|with&s;tanding the&s;e favorable Circum&s;tances, and not|with&s;tanding &s;uch future Turns of Providence as may make for us, it is beyond all Doubt, this will be the <HI>mo&s;t melancholy and calamitous Year that</HI> Vir|ginia <HI>has ever &s;een;</HI> and he is a &s;tupid Creature in|deed, that can flatter him&s;elf with better Hopes. To &s;uch, if there be &s;uch among you, I may ad|dre&s;s the Words of <HI>Jeremiah</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> v. 12.</NOTE>, <Q>They have belied the Lord, and &s;aid, It is not He, neither &s;hall Evil come upon us, neither &s;hall we &s;ee Sword or Fa|mine.</Q> And over &s;uch I may take up the Com|plaint of the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xxvi. 11.</NOTE> 'Lord when thy Hand is lifted up, they will not &s;ee,' nor labour to e&s;cape the falling Blow: 'But they &s;hall &s;ee,' to their Co&s;t, 'and be a&s;hamed' of their fooli&s;h Pre&s;ump|tion. But I hope you are generally alarmed, and would willingly improve &s;uch afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations to the be&s;t Purpo&s;es; to which I hope to lead you in the Expo&s;ition of the Words I have read to you.</P>
<P>It would certainly be an In&s;tance of the greate&s;t Stupidity, to groan under the&s;e Calamities, with|out carrying our Enquiries &s;o far as.&mdash;Who is the proper original Author of them?&mdash;What is the Rea&s;on that God hath withheld &s;o many of his u&s;ual Ble&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> from us, and afflicted us with &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="007644_0012_102D985251F9BAF8">many Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and that notwith&s;tanding our pa&s;t Deliverances, and the many Privileges with which he has been plea&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h us?&mdash;How long &s;hall the&s;e Judgments be continued? and what is the readie&s;t Way to e&s;cape them? The&s;e are very proper Enquiries in the pre&s;ent Situation of our Country; and to each of the&s;e my Text will fur|ni&s;h us with an An&s;wer; as I &s;hall &s;hew you, when I have hinted a Word or two concerning the origi|nal Occa&s;ion of this Prophecy.</P>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Amos</HI> was &s;ent to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> to|wards the latter End of their Kingdom, to warn them of the &s;ore Judgments of Famine, War, and Captivity, which were ju&s;t coming upon them, for their long Cour&s;e of &s;inning from Generation to Generation. It was to the&s;e <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> that the Words of my Text were primarily directed; and they are equally &s;uitable to us in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, which are &s;o like to theirs.</P>
<P>Let us now enquire.</P>
<P N="1">I. Who is the <HI>proper original Author</HI> or Inflictor of the Calamities under which our Country groans? Is our Country under no Influence or Power, but what is vi&s;ible? Are all our Affairs under the Ma|nagement of <HI>Chance</HI> or <HI>Fortune?</HI> Or is this World the <HI>ab&s;olute, independent</HI> Kingdom of <HI>Men,</HI> without any Subordination to a &s;uperior Power? Or do na|tural Cau&s;es operate, and accompli&s;h Events of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> without any Dependence upon the great Creator? Ala&s;s! do we lie at the Mercy of blind Cau&s;es, or of the &s;tronge&s;t Arm, or the mo&s;t politic Head? Are we to look no higher than the <HI>Clouds,</HI> for the Cau&s;e of Drought? And are we to trace the
<PB N="14" REF="007644_0013_102D9853DA09F848">Origin of the Defeat of our Army, no farther than the Power or Stratagems of the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Indians?</HI> If this be Ca&s;e, what a mi&s;erable World is this? what a State of <HI>Anarchy</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ion?</HI> Then we have nothing to tru&s;t to, but the Arm of Fle&s;h; we are cut off from the Relief of Prayer to an all|ruling God; we are ca&s;t off from the Rock of Confidence in his all-governing Providence: For why &s;hould we pray to, or tru&s;t in, one, that does not concern him&s;elf in our Affairs? But is this really the Ca&s;e? Is the World left thus without a &s;upreme univer&s;al Head? Every pious Heart mu&s;t an&s;wer, "I hope not; or I am undone."

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>AMOS iii. 1&mdash;6.</HI></BIBL> Hear this Word that the Lord hath &s;poken again&s;t you, O Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> again&s;t the whole Family which I brought up from the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> &s;aying, you only have I known of all the Families of the Earth; therefore I will puni&s;h you for all your Iniqui|ties.&mdash;Shall one take up a Snare from the Earth, and have taken nothing at all? Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City; and the People not be afraid?&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the foregoing Sermon, I left unfini&s;hed an Inquiry of great Importance to us in the pre&s;ent Situation of our COUNTRY, <HI>viz.</HI> "What is the Rea&s;on that God hath withheld &s;o many of his u&s;ual Ble&s;&s;ings from us?'&mdash;This Part of the Enquiry I have already an&s;wered; and I hope your Hearts are &s;till under the Impre&s;&s;ions of it. If he does not <HI>walk</HI> amicably with us, it is becau&s;e we are <HI>not agreed:</HI> And if he afflicts us, it is becau&s;e we have &s;inned again&s;t him. <HI>The Lion hath roared</HI> again&s;t us, becau&s;e he hath found us a proper <HI>Prey.</HI> But it remains for us to enquire, "Why he hath done this, notwith&s;tanding our pa&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings and Deliverances, and the many Privi|leges
<PB N="34" REF="007644_0033_102D9881F0CEFAD8">with which he hath been plea&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h us?" We may gather an An&s;wer to this from his Conduct towards the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> related in the fir&s;t and &s;econd Ver&s;es of my Text.</P>
<P>The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were the Po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> tho&s;e favourite Patriarchs, with whom God conde&s;cended to enter into Covenant, both for them and their Seed. They were a Family miraculou&s;ly delivered from <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Slavery, conducted thro' an hideous Wilderne&s;s into a Land of Liberty and Plenty, and protected there by an immediate Providence. But their highe&s;t Privilege was, that God had taken them for <HI>his Church</HI> and peculiar People, favoured them with a Revelation of his Will, and a Religion from Heaven, and &s;ent his Prophets to them to in&s;truct and admoni&s;h them.&mdash;But that ungrateful People forgot their Obligations to their divine Benefactor, grew weary of his Service, rebelled again&s;t him, and became debauched in Principles and Morals. And will it &s;ecure them, when thus degenerate, that they were once di&s;tingui&s;hed with &s;o many Ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;till profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves the Church of God? Could this &s;ecure them again&s;t his Judgments? No; &s;o far from it, that the&s;e very Circum&s;tances encrea&s;ed their Guilt, and rendered their Puni&s;hments more certain and &s;evere. <Q><HI>You only,</HI> &s;aith the Lord <HI>have I known of all the Families of the Earth:</HI> I have cho&s;en you to be my Church and People, while I &s;uffered other Nations to walk in Darkne&s;s, and at a Di&s;tance from me:</Q> And what follows from hence? Not, <Q>therefore I will grant you greater Indulgence in Sin;</Q> or, <Q>I will over-look it in
<PB N="35" REF="007644_0034_102D98841C326628">you, though I might puni&s;h it in other Nations:</Q> but, <Q><HI>therefore I will puni&s;h you for all your Iniquities:</HI> whoever e&s;cape, you &s;hall not: tho' I &s;hould bear with the Sins of others, I will not bear with yours, whom I have known and di&s;tingui&s;hed from them.</Q></P>
<P>There are many good Rea&s;ons for this peculiar Severity towards the profe&s;&s;ing People of God&mdash; He has a particular <HI>Property</HI> in &s;uch; and therefore he expects particular Obedience from them.&mdash;He has a &s;pecial <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> for them, and laid them under peculiar <HI>Obligations</HI> of Gratitude; and con&s;equently their Undutifulne&s;s and Ingratitude mu&s;t touch him very near. A Man is more affected with the unkind Treatment of a Friend or a Child, than a Stranger or an Enemy.&mdash;God is peculiarly <HI>related</HI> to &s;uch a People; and therefore their Wickedne&s;s reflects more Di&s;honour upon him, than that of tho&s;e who do not profe&s;s his Name.&mdash;God may al&s;o have De&s;igns of &s;pecial Grace towards &s;ome of them, and he may cha&s;ti&s;e them for their Amendment, and in order to deliver them from the more dread|ful Puni&s;hments of the eternal World. A Father may correct his <HI>Child</HI> for a Fault that he would over-look in a Stranger.&mdash;Such a People have peculiar <HI>Helps</HI> and Advantages, and are under &s;pecial Obllgations; and con&s;equently their Sin is much more aggravated, than that of Heathens, who are not in &s;uch favourable Circum&s;tances for Religion. On all the&s;e Accounts it is ju&s;t, rea&s;ona|ble, and indeed nece&s;&s;ary, that God &s;hould puni&s;h with peculiar Severity the Sins of his People, on whom his Name is called; and that they &s;hould not
<PB N="36" REF="007644_0035_102D9886A4DE1088">fly to his Altar for Protection, in their Rebellion again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Let us now apply the&s;e Things to our&s;elves and our Country. God has di&s;tingui&s;hed us with a rich Variety of Ble&s;&s;ings, above mo&s;t People in the World, and made our Country a favourite Spot of the Globe. The fir&s;t Planters of this Colony, pa&s;&s;ed thro' &s;urpri&s;ing Vici&s;&s;itudes; and were more than once in Danger of being entirely cut off by their <HI>Indian</HI> Predece&s;&s;ors. But thro' the tender Guardian&s;hip of Providence, they &s;urvived all the&s;e Dangers: And now, this Wilderne&s;s is improved into a fruitful Field; and we have enjoyed as long an uninterrupted Peace and Plenty, as perhaps any Country upon Earth. Our Colony has prodi|giou&s;ly increa&s;ed of late Years in the Number of its Inhabitants; and in Extent of Ground, it is per|haps equal to our mother Country. It has been an happy Refuge to the Poor; who &s;warm the Streets, and crowd the Work-Hou&s;es and Ho&s;pitals, in other Countries: Here they generally enjoy a very comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence by moderate Indu&s;try; and hardly any of them are incapable of providing for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e are great Ble&s;&s;ings; but they are not the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> with which Heaven has di&s;tingui&s;hed our Land. He has brought his Go&s;pel, as a Vine from afar, and planted it in this Wilderne&s;s, that was once the Re&s;idence of Heathen Savages and wild Bea&s;ts. The <HI>BIBLE</HI> is, or may be, the common Ble&s;&s;ing of our whole Land; and none who enjoy that Directory to everla&s;ting Life, have Rea&s;on to complain, that they are left wholly de&s;titute of the
<PB N="37" REF="007644_0036_102D988AA5EDD6C0">Means of Salvation, We are a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> a <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Country; and how few Parts of the World can &s;ay &s;o? I might add what will not appear incredible to &s;ome of you, who have been the happy Subjects or Witne&s;&s;es of it, that God has &s;ent his Go&s;pel into &s;undry Parts of our Land, and among us in particular, in its Purity, and attended with his own Almighty Power, to make it effectual to renew many depraved Hearts, and reform many vicious Lives: And wherever &s;uch a Work is going on, I &s;hall rejoice in it as a WORK OF GOD, what|ever Name it bears: Yes, my Brethren, I &s;hall rejoice to &s;ee <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> pure, practical Chri&s;tianity, Chri&s;tianity free from the Encumbrance of Party-Names, flouri&s;h and encrea&s;e; and without this, it is but little Matter what Party is uppermo&s;t, or has the &s;orry Sanction of a civil E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>With the&s;e important Privileges has God favored our Land, and us in particular. Thus graciou&s;ly has he <HI>known</HI> and di&s;tingui&s;hed us, above mo&s;t of the Families of the Earth. But will the&s;e Favors <HI>indemnify</HI> an ungrateful Land, in the Abu&s;e of them, or warrant them to offend again&s;t their peculiar Bene|factor? Will this <HI>neglected</HI> Bible, will this <HI>abu&s;ed</HI> Go&s;pel, will the&s;e <HI>profaned</HI> Ordinances, &s;helter you from the Judgments of God, when your Sins cry aloud for them? Will a <HI>&s;lighted</HI> Saviour deliver you? Will his <HI>profaned</HI> Name &s;anctify your Crimes, and be a Mark of Protection to you? Does the <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of Mercy, promi&s;e you <HI>farther</HI> Mercy? Does the ungrateful Forgetfulne&s;s of pa&s;t Deliverances, encourage you to hope for future? Do not the&s;e Things, on the other Hand, give you Rea&s;on to
<PB N="38" REF="007644_0037_102D988C413A06A0">fear the contrary, that <Q><HI>becau&s;e</HI> he hath known you above mo&s;t of the Nations of the Earth, <HI>therefore</HI> he will puni&s;h you for all your Iniquities?</Q> Our Enemies are perfidious <HI>French</HI> Papals, and &s;avage <HI>Indian</HI> Heathens; they may be as bad, or wor&s;e, than we, in all Re&s;pects, but this, that we &s;in again&s;t more Light and Love, and break thro' more endearing Obligations.

<P>The III^d Enquiry now remains, How <HI>long,</HI> we may expect, the&s;e Calamities will continue on our Land? And what is the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Method to remove or e&s;cape them?</P>
<P>God has always &s;ome wi&s;e De&s;ign in all his Di&s;pen&s;ations, and particularly in the inflicting of Calamities: And his De&s;ign in it, as far as we may venture to determine, is either to <HI>reform,</HI> or to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> a People. I know of no national Calamity, but what is intended for one or the other of the&s;e Ends; and generally, <HI>both</HI> are intended with regard to different Per&s;ons. God may de&s;ign to <HI>cha&s;ten</HI> and <HI>amend</HI> &s;ome as a Father; and by the &s;ame Stroke to <HI>harden</HI> and <HI>puni&s;h</HI> others, who are ripe for his Judgments.</P>
<P>The&s;e are his De&s;igns towards thee, O my Coun|try, in the pre&s;ent critical Juncture; to <HI>amend</HI> thee, or to <HI>de&s;troy</HI> thee; to bring &s;ome of thy Inhabitants to Repentance, and to harden the incorrigible, and vi&s;it them with his de&s;pi&s;ed Vengeance. And can we hope he will remove his angry Hand from us, till he has accompli&s;hed his De&s;ign one Way or other. <Q><HI>Shall one take up a Snare from the Earth, and have taken Nothing at all?</HI></Q> &s;ays my Text. No, he will let it lie there, 'til he has caught his Prey, if po&s;&s;ible. And will a wi&s;e God &s;catter his Judgments for no End at all? or will he remove them, before they have an&s;wered his End? No; they &s;hall accompli&s;h the Thing for which he &s;ent them.</P>

<PB N="44" REF="007644_0043_102D723BC2830D18">now, it will highly aggravate your Sin and Ruin. The <HI>Snare</HI> &s;hall not be taken up from the Earth, 'till it has taken &s;omething;' and the Judgments of God &s;hall not be removed, till they have an&s;wered his De&s;ign, the De&s;ign either of <HI>Vengeance</HI> or of <HI>Grace.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;hut up this Di&s;cour&s;e with an Advice or two, &s;uited to the pre&s;ent Situation of our Coun|try.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Put your&s;elves in a Po&s;ture of Defence.</HI> We do not certainly know the De&s;igns of our Enemies, whether they intend immediately to improve the Advantages they have gained, and over-run the Country; or whether they will content them&s;elves for the pre&s;ent to &s;ecure the Acqui&s;itions they have made, and to ravage and plunder our Families. But we ought to provide again&s;t Contingencies, and prepare for the wor&s;t. Therefore furni&s;h your|&s;elves with Arms and Ammunition, as well as their pre&s;ent Scarcity will allow. You may yet need them for your own Defence; or if the Enemy &s;hould not make Inroads &s;o far into the Center of the Colony, your A&s;&s;i&s;tance may be nece&s;&s;ary for the Protection of our poor expo&s;ed Brethren in the remote We&s;tern Counties, that are liable to their Barbarities: For it is unrea&s;onable that the whole Burden of defending our Frontiers &s;hould lie upon them. If you have a Drop of <HI>Briti&s;h Blood</HI> in your Veins, if your have any Thing of the Spirit of <HI>Men,</HI> or of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> exert your&s;elves on this Occa&s;ion. It now becomes you to be all <HI>Patriots,</HI> all <HI>Soldiers.</HI> Your Liberty, your Property, your Religion, your Lifes, your All, are at Stake: Your Families,
<PB N="45" REF="007644_0044_102D723DB27432E0">your Po&s;terity call upon you to exert your&s;elves, and not deliver them up to Slavery, to Cruelty, to Super&s;tition. Had you ever had the unhappy Ex|perience of a <HI>French</HI> Government,&mdash;a <HI>French</HI> Go|vernment over <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI>&mdash;a <HI>French</HI> Government over <HI>conquered</HI> Prote&s;tants,&mdash;over conquered <HI>Britons,</HI> their natural Enemies; you would be deeply &s;en&s;ible that all the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings are in Danger; and you would rather generou&s;ly ri&s;que your Lives, or fly to the remote&s;t Parts of the Earth, than &s;uffer &s;uch an Iron Yoke to be rivetted about your Necks. Therefore 'quit your&s;elves like Men, be &s;trong.' The Imprecation of the Prophet, will fall upon the mean, &s;neaking Coward. <Q>Cur&s;ed be the Man that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</Q> Shall we tamely re&s;ign &s;uch a flouri&s;hing, wide-extended Country into the mercile&s;s Hands of Barbarity, arbitrary Power, and popi&s;h Super&s;tition? Have we enjoyed the Ble&s;&s;ings and Privileges of our Country, while in Peace; and &s;hall we abandon it, and leave it to &s;hift for it&s;elf, when in Danger? Certainly &s;uch &s;ordid, effeminate Souls are un|worthy of a Place in any Country. Can you bear the Thought, that Slavery &s;hould clank her Chain in this Land of Liberty? That the Hou&s;e of God &s;hould be made the Temple of Idols? That you &s;hould entail Slavery, and Idolatry upon your mi&s;erable Po&s;terity? Can you bear the Thought, that <HI>Indian</HI> Savages, and <HI>French Papi&s;ts,</HI> infamous all the World over for Treachery and Tyranny, &s;hould rule <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> and <HI>Britons,</HI> with a Rod of Iron; and riot in tho&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, for which you have &s;weat and labored? If you have any
<PB N="46" REF="007644_0045_102D724A269AE770">manly Re&s;entment within you, let it kindle at the Thought: <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion was made for &s;uch an Object;</HI> and you may lawfully indulge it. The Ca&s;e of our Country is not yet de&s;perate: <Q>In the Name of the Lord, we will yet lift up our Banners;</Q> and hope for Succe&s;s and Victory. But if a Spirit of Pre&s;umption, or Cowardice, continue to lull a|&s;leep, or unman, the Inhabitants, I mu&s;t give thee up, O my Country! Such a Set of da&s;tardly Crea|tures are unworthy of &s;o happy a Spot on the Globe; and no Wonder if their Dwellings &s;hould ca&s;t them out.</P>
<P>If any of you are frightned and intimidated from venturing your Lives for your Country, becau&s;e you are full of Fears about your everla&s;ting State, and you would de&s;ire to live longer, to make it &s;ure: To &s;uch of you I would &s;ay, Now you find the bad Effects of your former Negligence. Had you <Q>given all Diligence to make your Calling and Election &s;ure,</Q> in Times of Peace and Safety, you would not probably be left in &s;uch Perplexity, in the Hour of Difficulty. You have no other Way now, but diligently improve the Time you have: And if, after thorough Self-examination you can entertain even trembling Hopes of your Preparation for Eternity, you may couragiou&s;ly venture, and leave the Event to God. Your cowardly De&s;ertion of the Cau&s;e of your Country, and &s;eeking to pro|long your Life by that unlawful Means, will not be a likely Way to remove Doubts and Fears. You would be always haunted with a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Guilt; and that would damp your Spirits, ca&s;t a Gloom over your Minds, and ob&s;cure the Evidences
<PB N="47" REF="007644_0046_102D9898B9F130E0">of your Hopes. FOLLOW THE PATH OF DUTY, wherever it leads; for that will always prove the &s;afe&s;t in the I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>As for &s;uch of you as are really unprepared for your latter End, and ju&s;tly con&s;cious of it; I have &s;undry Things to &s;ay to you; and oh! that they may &s;ink deep into your Hearts. (1.) How may it &s;hock you to think, that you who have lived &s;o long in the World, &s;hould want more Time to turn to God, and prepare for Eternity? Ala&s;s! what have you done with the ten, twenty, thirty, or forty Years that God has given you for this Purpo&s;e? Ah! are they all gone, without doing any of the great Work you were &s;ent into the World for? Have they all been wa&s;ted upon Sin, the Fle&s;h, and the World, and &s;acrificed to the Devil? Have you been de&s;troying your&s;elves all this Time? Oh! Sirs, have I not told you of this, but in vain? Have I not often warned you of the Danger of Delays in turning to God? Will you now at length believe me? Oh! will you now conclude it high Time for you to return to God? (2.) If the Rea&s;on why you de&s;ire to pre&s;erve your Lives longer, be, that you may have Time to turn to God, and prepare for Eternity, then you are carefully improving the Time you now have. It is a vain Pretence that you <HI>want more Time</HI> for this, if you do not <HI>u&s;e the Time you have.</HI> And are you doing &s;o? Are you &s;eeking the Lord in earne&s;t, and endeavouring to repent and turn to him? If not, you only want Time to &s;in longer, to pur&s;ue the World and your Plea&s;ures longer. And can you expect, God will indulge you in &s;uch a wicked
<PB N="48" REF="007644_0047_102D989B65106B28">De&s;ire? (3.) It is not the Want of Time but the Want of a Heart, that keeps you unconverted. St. <HI>Paul</HI> was converted in three Days, the <HI>Jaylor</HI> in a few Hours, and St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Hearers under one &s;hort Sermon; and why may not you hope for the like Ble&s;&s;ing, if you exert your&s;elves in earne&s;t? (4.) To excite you to this, let me try an Argument or two from a new Topic.&mdash;It is you and &s;uch Sinners as you, that have brought all the&s;e Calami|ties upon the Country: Impenitent Sinners are the Bane of Society; and bring down the Wrath of God upon it. Therefore if you would &s;ave your Country, repent and be converted. What a cutting Thought may it now be to you, <Q>I am one of the guilty Creatures for whom my Country is now &s;uffering?</Q>&mdash;Con&s;ider al&s;o, if the Things you fear &s;hould come upon you, how mi&s;erable would you be! An angry God above you! a withering, ravaged Country, an Aceldama, a Field of Blood, around you! a guilty Con&s;cience within you! and a burning Hell, ju&s;t before you! Then you will borrow the de&s;pairing Complaint of <HI>Saul,</HI> <Q>The <HI>Phili&s;tians</HI> are upon me, and God is departed from me.</Q> Then you will &s;ee the U&s;e of Reli|gion, and bitterly lament your Neglect of it. There|fore now make it your Concern.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let this be a Sea&s;on of Prayer and Supplication among us.</HI> If God be the &s;upreme King of our Country, let us implore, and depend upon, his Protection. <Q>Should not a People &s;eek unto their God
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> viii. 19.</NOTE>?</Q> Prayer is the <HI>Language of Nature in Di&s;tre&s;s;</HI> and Men that had no other Principle to
<PB N="49" REF="007644_0048_102D989CEE8685C0">direct them, have fled to this Refuge, upon the Appearance of Danger. <Q>Some put their Tru&s;t in Chariots, and &s;ome in Hor&s;es;</Q> and our Country has no doubt offended in putting their Confidence in a brave General, in veteran Soldiers, and a fine Train of Artillery; and what is become of them all? Let us learn for the future to put our Tru&s;t in the Lord of Ho&s;ts; and <Q>if he be on our Side, we need not fear what Man can do.</Q> His A&s;&s;i&s;tance is to be obtained only in the Way of <HI>Prayer:</HI> Therefore lift up your Cries to him; keep your Souls always in a praying Po&s;ture. And for your Encouragement, let me a&s;&s;ure you, that 'the fervent Prayer of a righteous Man,' is not u&s;ele&s;s Breath pour'd out in the Air, but 'avail|eth much.' In this Way the feeble and timerous, and even the tender Sex, may contribute to the Defence of their Country, in &s;ome retired and peaceful Corner. They may engage the God of Heaven to become our <HI>Ally;</HI> and <Q>thro' him we will be able to pu&s;h down our Enemies; thro' his Name will we tread them under, that ri&s;e up again&s;t us
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Finally; Do not indulge exce&s;&s;ive De&s;pondency in the pre&s;ent di&s;couraging Po&s;ture of Affairs. What is your Religion good for, if it do not &s;upport you in &s;uch a Time as this? Do not di&s;grace it, by unmanly da&s;tardly Fears. Shew the World that you have a God to go to in your Difficulties, and that you can chearfully live or die under his Shelter. I am &s;olicitous for the Behaviour of my Countrymen in general, at this Juncture: But I mu&s;t tell you,
<PB N="50" REF="007644_0049_102D98A04E156860">I am particularly &s;olicitous, that you my Brethren of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> &s;hould behave with Honor and Spirit; and &s;hew your&s;elves worthy of the&s;e Privi|leges you enjoy, and of tho&s;e you claim. Many of us have taken the <HI>Oaths</HI> to His Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Government; and we cannot de&s;ert the Cau&s;e of our Country, at this Time, without gro&s;s Per|jury&mdash;But I &s;hall de&s;i&s;t. Your own Hearts, I hope, &s;upply my Defects, and &s;ugge&s;t to you a thou&s;and Con&s;iderations adapted to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e and may God make them prevalent with you. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
